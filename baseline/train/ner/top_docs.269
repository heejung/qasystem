   In <DATE>1905</DATE>, <PERSON>Pablo Picasso</PERSON> painted ``Au Lapin
Agile,'' a Parisian tavern scene, for his suppers. In <DATE>1989</DATE>,
philanthropist <PERSON>Walter Annenberg</PERSON> bought it for <MONEY>$40.7 million</MONEY>.
   The painting, in which <ORGANIZATION>Picasso</ORGANIZATION> depicts himself as a harlequin,
had been described by <PERSON>John L. Marion</PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>North
America</LOCATION>, as the most important 20th-century picture to come up for
auction.
   <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>'s price fell within the presale estimate, but left it
behind another famous self-portrait painted four years earlier.
``Yo Picasso'' sold for <MONEY>$47.85 million</MONEY> at <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby</ORGANIZATION>'s in <DATE>May</DATE>, a
record for the artist and more than double its presale estimate.
   The record for any work of art _ <MONEY>$53.9 million</MONEY> _ was set in <DATE>1987</DATE>
for <PERSON>Vincent van Gogh</PERSON>'s ``Irises.''
   ``We were a little disappointed it didn't pass `Yo Picasso,'''
said <PERSON>John Payson</PERSON>, whose sister, <PERSON>Linda de Roulet</PERSON>, consigned ``Au
Lapin Agile.''
   Payson's and <PERSON>Mrs. de Roulet</PERSON>'s mother, art collector and former
<LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> Mets owner <PERSON>Joan Whitney Payson</PERSON>, acquired the painting in
<DATE>1952</DATE> for <MONEY>$60,000</MONEY>.
   She displayed it in her <LOCATION>Long Island</LOCATION> home and bequeathed it to
her daughter. ``Irises'' also came from the collection.
   <PERSON>John Payson</PERSON> had said his sister offered the Picasso because the
prices commanded by ``Irises'' and ``Yo Picasso'' made her ``a bit
nervous having the painting in her house.''
   <PERSON>Mrs. de Roulet</PERSON> said she would establish a foundation for medical
research and education with part of the proceeds.
   Annenberg, of <LOCATION>Rancho Mirage</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, the former <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> ambassador
to <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> and friend of former President <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>, was in the auction
house but bid by phone, said <PERSON>Diana Brooks</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby's
North America</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>Marion</PERSON> said <PERSON>Annenberg</PERSON>'s collection had ``just about everything
but a great Picasso.''
   While subdued in comparison with other recent auctions,
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>'s sale drew an estimated 1,500 people, totaled
<MONEY>$269.5 million</MONEY> and set records for 12 artists.
   Among other highlights:
   _<PERSON>Picasso</PERSON>'s ``The Mirror,'' one of a series of portraits of
sleeping women done in <DATE>1932</DATE>, sold for <MONEY>$26.4 million</MONEY> to Japanese
dealer <PERSON>Shigeki Kameyama</PERSON>.
   _<ORGANIZATION>Picasso</ORGANIZATION>'s ``Mere et Enfant,'' which dates from <DATE>1921</DATE> when the
artist's son was born, sold for <MONEY>$18.7 million</MONEY> to a private Japanese
collector.
   _<PERSON>Edouard Manet</PERSON>'s ``La Promenade'' sold for <MONEY>$14.8 million</MONEY> to a
Japanese dealer.
   _<PERSON>Van Gogh</PERSON>'s ``Quarry near Saint-Remy,'' a landscape painted in
<DATE>1889</DATE>, was sold for <MONEY>$11.5 million</MONEY> to a Japanese dealer.
   All prices include a <PERCENT>10 percent</PERCENT> premium.
   `Young Girls at the Piano,'' a Renoir pastel produced in <DATE>1892</DATE> on
commission from the French government, failed to sell. The <ORGANIZATION>Renoir</ORGANIZATION>
had been expected to bring up to <MONEY>$30 million</MONEY>, but the high bid was
<MONEY>$17.5 million</MONEY>.
   ``Au Lapin Agile,'' which means the agile rabbit, was the name
of the tavern frequented by <ORGANIZATION>Picasso</ORGANIZATION>.
   He painted ``Au Lapin Agile'' when he was 25. It shows him and a
woman _ model <PERSON>Germaine Pichot</PERSON> _ standing at a bar, brooding and
disenchanted with one another. Picasso had blamed <PERSON>Pichot</PERSON> for
causing his best friend's suicide.
   ``The big question in the picture is whether or not at the time
it was painted <PERSON>Picasso</PERSON> was actually having an affair with this
woman,'' <PERSON>Brooks</PERSON> said.
   A photograph from the period shows the painting hanging unframed
in a bar.
   ``I painted it in exchange for free meals and drinks,'' <ORGANIZATION>Picasso</ORGANIZATION>
once said.

   A scene in a Parisian tavern that <PERSON>Pablo Picasso</PERSON>
painted when he was 25 in exchange for free meals and drinks sold
for <MONEY>$40.7 million</MONEY> at auction <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
   The <DATE>1905</DATE> painting ``Au Lapin Agile,'' in which <ORGANIZATION>Picasso</ORGANIZATION> depicts
himself as a harlequin, is ``the most important 20th-century
picture to come up for auction,'' said <PERSON>John L. Marion</PERSON>, chairman of
<ORGANIZATION>Sotheby</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION>.
   ``It goes to the <ORGANIZATION>Annenberg Collection</ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON>Marion</PERSON> said as he
hammered down the sale. Southeby's had predicted the work would
fetch <MONEY>$35 million</MONEY> to <MONEY>$40 million</MONEY>.
   The auction house said the painting will go to the private
collection of <PERSON>Walter Annenberg</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Rancho Mirage</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, the
philanthropist and former owner of TV Guide magazine, a close
friend of former President <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>.
   The painting was consigned by <PERSON>Linda de Roulet</PERSON>, daughter of art
collector <PERSON>Joan Whitney Payson</PERSON>, who acquired it in <DATE>1952</DATE> and hung it
in her <LOCATION>Manhasset</LOCATION> home. <PERSON>Mrs. de Roulet</PERSON> said in a statement she felt
``Au Lapin Agile'' has become too valuable a painting to keep.
   ``I plan to establish a foundation for medical research and
education with part of the proceeds,'' she added.
   ``Au Lapin Agile'' was painted four years after another famous
self-portrait, ``Yo Picasso,'' which sold for <MONEY>$47.85 million</MONEY> at
<ORGANIZATION>Sotheby</ORGANIZATION>'s in <DATE>May</DATE>. That was a record for the artist and more than
double its presale estimate.
   The record for any work of art _ <MONEY>$53.9 million</MONEY> _ was set in <DATE>1987</DATE>
for <PERSON>Vincent van Gogh</PERSON>'s ``Irises,'' also from the <LOCATION>Payson</LOCATION> collection.
   Several other paintings were on the block <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>:
   _<ORGANIZATION>Picasso</ORGANIZATION>'s ``The Mirror,'' one of a series of portraits of
sleeping women done in <DATE>1932</DATE>, was expected to bring up to <MONEY>$25
million</MONEY>.
   _``Mere et Enfant,'' which dates from <DATE>1921</DATE> _ the year of the
birth of <ORGANIZATION>Picasso</ORGANIZATION>'s son _ is estimated at up to <MONEY>$15 million</MONEY>.
   _A Renoir pastel, ``Young Girls at the Piano,'' produced in <DATE>1892</DATE>
on a commission from the French government, did not sell <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
It had been expected to bring up to <MONEY>$30 million</MONEY>.
   _<PERSON>Van Gogh</PERSON>'s ``Quarry near Saint-Remy,'' a landscape painted in
<DATE>1889</DATE>, was estimated to bring up to <MONEY>$15 million</MONEY>.
   _Major pieces by <PERSON>Piet Mondrian</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Picasso</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Paul Klee</PERSON>, <PERSON>Willem de
Kooning</PERSON>, <PERSON>Claude Monet</PERSON> and <PERSON>Joan Miro</PERSON> were being auctioned from the
collection of the late <PERSON>Edgar Kaufmann Jr</PERSON>. The 21 pieces were
expected to bring between <MONEY>$30 million</MONEY> and <MONEY>$40 million</MONEY>.
   <PERSON>Diane Brooks</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby</ORGANIZATION>'s president, described ``Au Lapin Agile''
as a large, powerful, serious painting, one of the most important
of <ORGANIZATION>Picasso</ORGANIZATION>'s rose period.
   In addition, she said, ``The subject has a story behind it.''
   Done when he was 25, the painting shows <PERSON>Picasso</PERSON> and a woman _
model <PERSON>Germaine Pichot</PERSON> _ standing at a bar, brooding and obviously
disenchanted with one another.
   Picasso blamed <PERSON>Pichot</PERSON> as being the cause of his best friend's
suicide four years earlier.
   ``The big question in the picture is whether or not at the time
it was painted <PERSON>Picasso</PERSON> was actually having an affair with this
woman himself,'' <PERSON>Brooks</PERSON> said.
   In the background is <PERSON>Frederic Gerard</PERSON>, the owner of the tavern
<ORGANIZATION>Lapin Agile</ORGANIZATION> (Sprightly Rabbit) and the painting's first owner. A
photograph from the period shows the painting hanging unframed in
the bar.

<P>
<PERSON>Vincent van Gogh</PERSON>'s "Portrait of Dr. Gachet" stunned the art market <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> when 
it was auctioned for <MONEY>$82.5 million</MONEY>, shattering the world record price for a 
painting by more than <MONEY>$28 million</MONEY>. 
</P>
<P>
The price was double the estimate by <ORGANIZATION>Christie's</ORGANIZATION>, a spokeswoman for the auction 
house said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is by far the world's most expensive painting," surpassing the previous 
auction record of <MONEY>$53.9 million</MONEY> bid by Australian businessman Alan Bond for Van 
Gogh's "Irises" in <DATE>November, 1987</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
The money for Bond's bid was largely borrowed from <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby</ORGANIZATION>'s, the house that 
handled the auction. The debt-ridden Bond was eventually forced to sell the 
painting for an undisclosed price to the <ORGANIZATION>J. Paul Getty Museum of Malibu</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The unidentified Japanese bidder was in the room during the about 10 minutes of 
bidding that opened at <MONEY>$20 million</MONEY>, <PERSON>Britman</PERSON> said. Toward the end of bidding, 
just two people were vying for the painting, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Portrait of <PERSON>Dr. Gachet</PERSON>" was painted six weeks before <PERSON>Van Gogh</PERSON> committed 
suicide in <DATE>1890</DATE>. Dr. <PERSON>Paul-Ferdinand Gachet</PERSON> tended Van Gogh in the weeks before 
his death. 
</P>
<P>
The record price quashed all reports of an art market in recession after <DATE>last 
week</DATE>'s disappointing contemporary sales. More than <PERCENT>35%</PERCENT> of the works had gone 
unsold last week. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd gasped when the bidding reached <MONEY>$50 million</MONEY>. 
</P>
<P>
It had been expected to fetch between <MONEY>$40 million</MONEY> and <MONEY>$50 million</MONEY> at a sale of 
major works by Impressionist and Modern artists. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a great painting," said <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION> art dealer <PERSON>Richard Feigen</PERSON>. "It's by a 
rare artist. It's in fine condition. There are practically no paintings like it 
in private hands." 
</P>
<P>
After the bidding, which was tensely conducted between the Japanese dealer and 
a telephone bidder, the jam-packed gallery broke into a standing ovation, 
prompting auctioneer <PERSON>Christopher Burge</PERSON> to pound his gavel to control the house. 
</P>
<P>
The painting was lent to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in <DATE>1984</DATE>. It is from the 
collection of <PERSON>Siegfried Kramarsky</PERSON>, a German-born <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> banker who died in 
<DATE>1961</DATE>. It was put on the block by a trust created under his will. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to artist <PERSON>Paul Gauguin</PERSON>, Van Gogh wrote on <DATE>June 16</DATE> that he had 
painted <PERSON>Gachet</PERSON> "with the heart-broken expression of our time" and that it was 
"not destined to be understood." 
</P>
<P>
Gachet, a practitioner of homeopathic medicine, was Van Gogh's friend and 
physician. He was also close to other Impressionist painters of the time. 
</P>
<P>
Van Gogh painted a second, slightly larger version of the portrait, which hangs 
in the <ORGANIZATION>Musee d'Orsay</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>. It lacks the details of the <PERSON>Kramarsky</PERSON> painting 
and its colors are flatter. 
</P>
<P>
Another Van Gogh from the <PERSON>Kramarsky</PERSON> collection was auctioned in <DATE>1987</DATE> for <MONEY>$20.24 
million</MONEY>. It too had been lent to the Metropolitan.

ART IN THE EIGHTIES; 
</P>
<P>
AN INTERNATIONAL BULL MARKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUZANNE MUCHNIC, TIMES ART WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The most expensive artwork on record at the end of the '70s was <PERSON>Velazquez</PERSON>'s 
<MONEY>$5.5-million</MONEY> painting, "Juan de Pareja." As the '80s draw to a close, that 
dubious honor is held by <PERSON>Van Gogh</PERSON>'s "Irises," which brought <MONEY>$53.9 million</MONEY> in a 
<DATE>1987</DATE> auction. 
</P>
<P>
What accounts for the 10-fold rise? 
</P>
<P>
* An injection of new money from American, European and Japanese collectors. 
The Japanese, for example, have inflated the French Impressionist market by 
purchasing vast quantities of paintings at escalating auction prices. One 
Japanese buyer -- <ORGANIZATION>Aska International</ORGANIZATION>, which operates the <ORGANIZATION>Aoyama Gallery</ORGANIZATION> in 
<LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> -- spent more than <MONEY>$120 million</MONEY> in <DATE>November</DATE> at <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> Impressionist art 
auctions. 
</P>
<P>
* An increase in private collectors who follow the art scene feather their 
nests with artworks and contribute to the image of collecting as a fashionable 
and intellectually rewarding activity. 
</P>
<P>
* A growing belief that art is a good investment, despite hard evidence to the 
contrary. 
</P>
<P>
* A change in income-tax laws in <DATE>1986</DATE> that reduced deductions of donated art to 
the purchase price instead of the appreciated value. Having lost a tax 
incentive for giving their collections to museums, private collectors began to 
cash in at auction. 
</P>
<P>
* A proliferation of high-quality -- or at least high-profile -- works on the 
resale market. <PERSON>John L. Marion</PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, dates this 
phenomenon to the <DATE>1983</DATE> sale of the <PERSON>Doris Havemeyer</PERSON> estate. Each big-ticket 
auction seems to beget others by encouraging collectors to sell. 
</P>
<P>
* Publicity about high auction prices that has raised public awareness and 
built large audiences. As art prices have become front-page news, <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby's</ORGANIZATION> and 
<ORGANIZATION>Christie</ORGANIZATION>'s have changed from sedate places where dealers did business to forums 
for public spectacles. These activities have filtered down from newspaper and 
television reports to ads for <ORGANIZATION>Hughes Markets</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Lincoln Town Cars</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
All these factors overlap and interact to such a degree that it is difficult to 
track the causes of the art boom. Effects of soaring art prices also can be 
elusive. The major auction houses and the sellers of multimillion-dollar 
artworks are obvious winners in this bull market, as are foundations and 
charities that have benefited richly from big art sales. The trickle-down 
effect on artists and dealers is a matter of hot debate, however. 
</P>
<P>
Among the losers during this money-happy decade are museums, most of which have 
been priced out of the art market at the very moment when reduced income-tax 
deductions have put a squeeze on donations. The <ORGANIZATION>J. Paul Getty Museum</ORGANIZATION> stands 
alone in its spending power, but even that wealthy institution's budget has 
been cramped by soaring prices. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the <PERSON>Getty</PERSON> has emerged as an important collector in the <DATE>'80s</DATE>. 
Originally feared for its presumed power to plunder the world's treasures, the 
museum later was chastised for being timid and stingy. In fact, the <ORGANIZATION>Getty</ORGANIZATION> has 
made big purchases throughout the decade. 
</P>
<P>
As prices have risen, the art market has become increasingly global. Sotheby's 
in <DATE>1988</DATE> staged a landmark auction of Russian avant-garde and Soviet 
contemporary art in <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION>. This year, <ORGANIZATION>Christie's</ORGANIZATION> launched a joint venture 
operation in <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION>, while Sotheby's joined the Japanese department store, 
<LOCATION>Seibu</LOCATION>, in a <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> auction. 
</P>
<P>
Big changes are also afoot in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>. <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> has lagged well behind <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> and 
<LOCATION>London</LOCATION> in art sales because of protectionist policies, but reforms are already 
under way and <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> is expected to open up to foreign sales after <DATE>1992</DATE>. Both 
<ORGANIZATION>Christie's</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby</ORGANIZATION>'s are gearing up for action there. 
</P>
<P>
Whether prices rise or fall, global growth is likely to be the big art market 
story of the '90s.

<TEXT>
   The family of <PERSON>Joan Whitney Payson</PERSON>, which sold
<PERSON>Vincent van Gogh</PERSON>'s ``Irises'' two years ago for <MONEY>$53.9 million</MONEY>, hopes
to fetch a similar price on <DATE>Nov. 15</DATE> for an early <ORGANIZATION>Picasso</ORGANIZATION>
self-portrait.
   Sotheby's said <DATE>Thursday</DATE> that ``Au Lapin Agile,'' named after a
tavern frequented by the artist, has been consigned by <PERSON>Mrs. Payson</PERSON>'s
daughter, <PERSON>Linda de Roulet</PERSON>, who kept the Picasso in her home in
<LOCATION>Manhasset</LOCATION>, on <LOCATION>Long Island</LOCATION>.
   She inherited it from her mother, a philanthropist, co-owner of a
racing stariod are in museums;
this one appeared briefly in <DATE>1980</DATE> at the <ORGANIZATION>National Museum of Western</ORGANIZATION>
Art in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>, said <PERSON>David Nash</PERSON>, senior vice president of fine arts
for <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>.
   Picasso, then 25, painted the unsigned work in <DATE>1905</DATE> as a gift to
<PERSON>Frederic Gerard</PERSON>, the tavern owner, who appears in the background,
strumming a guitar. ``Maybe Picasso gave it in exchange for a few
drinks _ who knows?'' said <PERSON>Nash</PERSON>.
   <PERSON>Mrs. Payson</PERSON> acquired it in <DATE>1952</DATE>. ``This magnificent painting was
in our parents' home in <LOCATION>Manhasset</LOCATION> for 27 years and, for a time, hung
near van Gogh's `Irises,''' <PERSON>Mrs. de Roulet</PERSON> said in a statement.
   Her brother said in an interview that <PERSON>Mrs. de Roulet</PERSON> also
displayed ``Au Lapin Agile'' prominently. But she became ``a bit
nervous having the painting in her house'' because of the prices
commanded by ``Irises'' and ``<PERSON>Yo Picasso</PERSON>,'' a <DATE>1901</DATE> self-portrait,
sold for <MONEY>$47.8 million</MONEY> on <DATE>May 9</DATE>.
   The real clincher, said <PERSON>Payson</PERSON>, was in <DATE>December</DATE>, when <PERSON>Mrs. de
Roulet</PERSON> discovered her grandsons playing with a dartboard near the
<ORGANIZATION>Picasso</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``That seemed to be some kind of an omen,'' said <PERSON>Payson</PERSON>.
   <PERSON>Nash</PERSON> said it's difficult to set a presale estimate because of the
unpredictable art market.
   ``This is much larger than `<ORGANIZATION>Yo Picasso</ORGANIZATION>.' It is a much more
complex painting, with considerable psychological tensions,'' he
said. ``In a logical world, it should lead to a higher price.''
   Part of the sale proceeds will be used to establish a foundation
for medical research and education.

   The widow of investor-publisher <PERSON>John Hay Whitney</PERSON>
will offer a Renoir from the couple's collection for sale for an
estimated <MONEY>$40 million</MONEY> to <MONEY>$50 million</MONEY>, <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby</ORGANIZATION>'s auction house said
<DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
   Pierre-Auguste <ORGANIZATION>Renoir</ORGANIZATION>'s <DATE>1876</DATE> artwork, acclaimed for its light,
shadow and movement, depicts the <ORGANIZATION>Moulin de la Galette</ORGANIZATION>, a French
outdoor dance hall in <LOCATION>Montmartre</LOCATION> frequented by avant-garde writers,
painters and actors.
   It shows a model named <PERSON>Estelle</PERSON> siting at a table with three of
<ORGANIZATION>Renoir</ORGANIZATION>'s friends, including biographer <PERSON>Georges Rivere</PERSON>, who later
described the painting as ``a page of history, a precious moment of
<LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> life depicted with rigorous examination.''
   The painting was owned for 60 years by <PERSON>Whitney</PERSON> and his wife,
<PERSON>Betsey Cushing Whitney</PERSON>.
   Whitney, who died in <DATE>1982</DATE>, founded <ORGANIZATION>J.H. Whitney &amp; Co.</ORGANIZATION>, a
venture-capitalist firm, and was an ambassador to <LOCATION>Great Britain</LOCATION> and
publisher of <ORGANIZATION>The New York Herald Tribune</ORGANIZATION>.
   He became a trustee of the Museum of Modern Art in <DATE>1930</DATE>, was
named president in <DATE>1941</DATE> and was chairman from <DATE>1946</DATE> to <DATE>1956</DATE>. He was
a trustee of the <ORGANIZATION>National Gallery of Art</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> from <DATE>1961</DATE> to
<DATE>1979</DATE>.
   A larger version of ``Au Moulin de la Galette'' is in the <LOCATION>Musee</LOCATION>
d'Orsay in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>. It is believed one was painted at the scene and
the other at <ORGANIZATION>Renoir</ORGANIZATION>'s studio _ but no one knows which is which.
   Sotheby's will take the <LOCATION>Whitney</LOCATION> version to <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> for a
comparison in <DATE>February</DATE>. Then, after exhibits in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Zurich</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Renoir</ORGANIZATION> will return to <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> for an auction
on <DATE>May 16</DATE>.
   After <PERSON>Whitney</PERSON>'s death, his wife gave five institutions 20 works
by <PERSON>Edgar Degas</PERSON>, <PERSON>Paul Gauguin</PERSON>, <PERSON>Pablo Picasso</PERSON>, <PERSON>Henri Rousseau</PERSON>,
<PERSON>Georges Seurat</PERSON>, <PERSON>James Abbott McNeill Whistler</PERSON> and other artists.
   Several other Whitneys also are well-known in the art world.
   Whitney's niece, <PERSON>Linda de Roulet</PERSON>, sold <PERSON>Pablo Picasso</PERSON>'s ``Au
Lapin Agile,'' a <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> tavern scene, on <DATE>Nov. 17</DATE> for <MONEY>$40.7 million</MONEY>.
   <PERSON>Mrs. de Roulet</PERSON>'s brother, <PERSON>John Whitney Payson</PERSON>, sold <PERSON>Vincent van
Gogh</PERSON>'s ``Irises'' in <DATE>1987</DATE> for <MONEY>$53.9 million</MONEY>, the highest price ever
obtained at an art auction.
   Payson got his money, but other parts of the deal went sour. It
turned out <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby's</ORGANIZATION> had lent Australian tycoon Alan Bond <MONEY>$27
million</MONEY> to help buy ``Irises,'' using the painting itself as
collateral. Bond didn't pay off the loan; the van Gogh is now in a
vault, its ownership cloudy. Last week, <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby's</ORGANIZATION> announced it was
abandoning its loan policy _ which triggered the quandary and
which, critics charged, inflated art prices in general.
   Both the van Gogh and the <PERSON>Picasso</PERSON> came from the collection of
former <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> Mets owner <PERSON>Joan Whitney Payson</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Whitney</LOCATION>'s sister
and the mother of <PERSON>Mrs. de Roulet</PERSON> and <PERSON>John Whitney Payson</PERSON>.

ROSE-PERIOD PICASSO HEADS FOR AUCTION BLOCK 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The family that sold <PERSON>Vincent van Gogh</PERSON>'s "Irises" for <MONEY>$53.9 million</MONEY> two years 
ago will put a rose-period Picasso on the block <DATE>Nov. 15</DATE> at <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. 
"Au Lapin Agile," a <DATE>1905</DATE> self-portrait expected to bring around <MONEY>$40 million</MONEY> or 
<MONEY>$50 million</MONEY>, has become "too expensive to keep," said <PERSON>Linda de Roulet</PERSON>, owner of 
the painting, in a prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
De <PERSON>Roulet</PERSON>, who inherited the Picasso from her mother, <PERSON>Joan Whitney Payson</PERSON>, is 
following in the footsteps of her brother, <PERSON>John Whitney Payson</PERSON>, who inherited 
"Irises" from the family collection. He sold "Irises" for a record price after 
another <PERSON>Van Gogh</PERSON>, "Sunflowers," brought <MONEY>$39.9 million</MONEY> at auction. 
</P>
<P>
De <PERSON>Roulet</PERSON>'s statement said she was persuaded to part with "Au Lapin Agile" 
after another early Picasso self-portrait, "Yo Picasso," sold in <DATE>May</DATE> for <MONEY>$47.85 
million</MONEY>. 
</P>
<P>
Also like her brother, who established a charitable foundation from the 
proceeds of "Irises," De <PERSON>Roulet</PERSON> will set up a foundation for medical research 
and education. AIDS research and the research unit of <ORGANIZATION>North Shore University 
Hospital</ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION>Cornell University Medical School</ORGANIZATION> will benefit from the the new 
<ORGANIZATION>Patrina Foundation</ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON>John Whitney Payson</PERSON>, speaking by telephone for his 
sister. Other causes will be decided on a case-by-case basis as applications 
for grants are received, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The family isn't distressed about breaking up the family collection, <PERSON>Payson</PERSON> 
said. "I'm sure <PERSON>Linda</PERSON> will feel as I did when I sold 'Irises.' I felt a kind of 
loss at first, but when I saw the grant applications come in and the potential 
of the funds, it was very exciting. It's an upbeat thing." 
</P>
<P>
"Au Lapin Agile" is considered one of the most important rose-period Picassos 
in private hands. Picasso painted it the year after he left <LOCATION>Barcelona</LOCATION> for 
<LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>. Living with his mistress, <PERSON>Fernande Olivier</PERSON>, in the dilapidated building 
known as the Bateau Lavoir, the young artist frequented a local circus and 
began to paint harlequin figures. 
</P>
<P>
In the gaily colored 39 x 39 1/2-inch oil, <ORGANIZATION>Picasso</ORGANIZATION> depicted himself as a 
brooding harlequin standing at a bar. A woman beside him is said to be <PERSON>Germaine 
Pichot</PERSON>, a model whom <ORGANIZATION>Picasso</ORGANIZATION> blamed for the <DATE>1901</DATE> death of his friend and fellow 
artist <PERSON>Carlos Casegemas</PERSON>, who was in love with her. 
</P>
<P>
"Au Lapin Agile" ("The Lively Rabbit") is named for a <LOCATION>Montmartre</LOCATION> cafe that is 
still in operation and once featured a sign picturing a rabbit in a saucepan. 
Picasso originally gave the painting to <PERSON>Frederic Gerard</PERSON>, the proprietor of the 
bohemian cafe who hung it there. Gerard is seen in the back of the picture, 
strumming his guitar. 
</P>
<P>
The painting subsequently passed through two private collections before <PERSON>Joan 
Whitney Payson</PERSON> bought it in <DATE>1952</DATE>. She was a philanthropist for civic and 
medical institutions, a breeder of race horses and owner of the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> Mets 
baseball team, as well as a formidable art collector. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Joan Whitney Payson</PERSON> was known to collect Impressionist and Post-Impressionist 
works, including paintings by <PERSON>Gauguin</PERSON> and <PERSON>Rousseau</PERSON>, in addition to <LOCATION>Van Gogh</LOCATION> and 
<ORGANIZATION>Picasso</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>John Whitney Payson</PERSON> was only 12 when his mother bought "Au Lapin Agile," but he 
recalls the delivery of a big crate to their home in <LOCATION>Manhasset</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION> 
"Unfortunately I was probably more interested in the truck that delivered it 
than I was in the painting, so my memories aren't very clear," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Payson does remember that the painting hung in a hallway near the entrance to 
the library, where the family spent a great deal of time. Old family photos 
show that at one point "Au Lapin Agile" and "Irises" shared a wall. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Linda de Roulet</PERSON>, who lives in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, resided in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> in the '50s with 
her late husband, <PERSON>Vincent de Roulet</PERSON>. She inherited the painting in <DATE>1975</DATE> at the 
death of her mother and has carried on <PERSON>Joan Whitney Payson</PERSON>'s philanthropic 
activities, serving on hospital and museum boards. De <PERSON>Roulet</PERSON> was president of 
the <ORGANIZATION>New York Mets</ORGANIZATION> from <DATE>1975</DATE> until the team was sold in <DATE>1980</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Is "Au Lapin Agile" just the second tip of the <LOCATION>Payson</LOCATION> iceberg? Will other 
family treasures be offered for sale in the future? 
</P>
<P>
"No other paintings are under consideration right now," <PERSON>Payson</PERSON> said.

   A masterpiece from <PERSON>Pablo Picasso</PERSON>'s ``blue period''
long thought to have disappeared is expected to become the world's
most expensive painting when sold at auction on <DATE>Nov. 30</DATE>, an
auctioneer said <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   ``Les Noces de Pierrette'' (``Pierrette's Wedding''), executed
in 1904-05 in <LOCATION>Montmartre</LOCATION>, is expected to bring <MONEY>$46 million</MONEY> to <MONEY>$61
million</MONEY>, said auctioneer <PERSON>Jean-Claude Binoche</PERSON>.
   ``It's going to shatter the world record not only for Picassos,
but for all paintings,'' <PERSON>Binoche</PERSON> said.
   The record paid at an auction for a <ORGANIZATION>Picasso</ORGANIZATION> was <MONEY>$48.7 million</MONEY>
for a <DATE>1901</DATE> self-portrait titled ``Yo Picasso,'' sold on <DATE>May 9</DATE>.
<PERSON>Vincent van Gogh</PERSON>'s ``Irises'' became the most expensive painting in
the world when it sold two years ago for <MONEY>$53.9 million</MONEY>.
   Binoche said he was hopeful Culture Minister <PERSON>Jack Lang</PERSON> would
allow ``Les Noces'' to leave <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>. The painting is considered
part of <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>'s national heritage and must receive an official
authorization to leave the country.
   With its hauntingly beautiful pink and blue tones, the work
straddles <ORGANIZATION>Picasso</ORGANIZATION>'s best-loved early periods. Six figures _ their
pale pink faces illuminated by an eerie light _ sit around a table
with the newlyweds. The bride wears a Spanish-style mantilla. Her
husband sports a top hat.
   Though experts are familiar with dozens of sketches <PERSON>Picasso</PERSON> drew
for ``Les Noces,'' the final work dropped from sight years ago.
Many thought it was lost in a fire.
   It surfaced in <DATE>1988</DATE> as part of a Picasso show in <LOCATION>Stockholm</LOCATION>.
<PERSON>Binoche</PERSON> said the work was long the property of a Swedish family
that does not want to be identified.
   ``The family considered the painting to be a private treasure,
and now it's for sale, that's all,'' he said.
   The sale has been hailed as the major event of the auction
season.
   Sotheby's in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> has said the family of <PERSON>Joan Whitney
Payson</PERSON>, the sellers of van Gogh's ``Irises,'' hope to fetch a
similar price on <DATE>Nov. 15</DATE> for an early <ORGANIZATION>Picasso</ORGANIZATION> self-portrait titled
``Au Lapin Agile,'' named after a tavern frequented by the artist.

Christie's and <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby</ORGANIZATION>'s are gearing up for the height of <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>'s fall 
auction season. They have laid in plentiful supplies of multimillion-dollar 
paintings, mailed catalogues far and wide, sent star artworks on the road and 
lined up prospective buyers. Now comes the public part: a round of auctions, on 
<DATE>Tuesday</DATE> through <DATE>Nov. 15</DATE>, that is expected to ring up more than <MONEY>$500 million</MONEY> in 
sales of contemporary, modern and Impressionist art. 
</P>
<P>
Art isn't the only thing for sale, however. Prestigious provenance is also on 
the block, as we see from the star-studded list of sellers. Collectors who are 
concerned about who has owned the art they buy should feel secure this season. 
Even those who want or need no validation of their own judgment are likely to 
be impressed by the consignors: 
</P>
<P>
* <PERSON>Lorinda de Roulet</PERSON>, sister of <PERSON>John Whitney Payson</PERSON> -- who sold <PERSON>Vincent van 
Gogh</PERSON>'s "Irises" for <MONEY>$53.9 million</MONEY> two years ago -- will sell <PERSON>Pablo Picasso</PERSON>'s 
"Au Lapin Agile" at <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby</ORGANIZATION>'s on <DATE>Nov. 15</DATE>. De <PERSON>Roulet</PERSON> and <PERSON>Payson</PERSON> inherited the 
paintings from their mother, <PERSON>Joan Whitney Payson</PERSON>, a noted collector, 
philanthropist and owner of the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> Mets. 
</P>
<P>
Rumors abound that "Au Lapin Agile" may replace "Irises" as the world's most 
expensive painting. Failing that, the Rose Period cabaret scene featuring 
<PERSON>Picasso</PERSON> as a harlequin may still break the artist's record of <MONEY>$47.85 million</MONEY> 
set in <DATE>May</DATE> for "Yo Picasso." Sotheby's has announced no firm estimate for "Au 
Lapin Agile," but a press release states that the firm anticipates "the same 
level of interest among collectors" as "Yo Picasso." 
</P>
<P>
* <PERSON>Paul Mellon</PERSON>, a major benefactor of the <ORGANIZATION>National Gallery</ORGANIZATION> of Art and son of 
museum founder <PERSON>Andrew W. Mellon</PERSON>, is pruning his personal collection to the tune 
of <MONEY>$100 million</MONEY>. Christie's <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> on <DATE>Nov. 14</DATE> will offer about <MONEY>$85 million</MONEY> to 
<MONEY>$90 million</MONEY> worth of that cache -- in the form of 15 Impressionist and modern 
works. 
</P>
<P>
Prime among them are <PERSON>Edouard Manet</PERSON>'s painting "Rue Mosnier, <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>, Decorated 
With Flags on <DATE>June 30, 1878</DATE>," valued at more than <MONEY>$30 million</MONEY>, and "The Tree, 
<LOCATION>Arles</LOCATION>," a vivid <DATE>1888</DATE> landscape by <PERSON>Van Gogh</PERSON>, expected to bring at least <MONEY>$25 
million</MONEY>. Picasso's "Death of a Harlequin," a Rose Period painting that <ORGANIZATION>Mellon</ORGANIZATION> 
bought from <PERSON>W. Somerset Maugham</PERSON>'s collection, is expected to sell for more than 
<MONEY>$20 million</MONEY>. Three of <PERSON>Edgar Degas</PERSON>' wax sculptures of ballet dancers, valued at 
<MONEY>$1.5 million</MONEY> to <MONEY>$2 million</MONEY> apiece, are also in the Mellon sale. 
</P>
<P>
* <PERSON>Billy Wilder</PERSON>, a legendary film maker and highly regarded art collector, will 
sell 94 modern and contemporary works at <ORGANIZATION>Christie</ORGANIZATION>'s on <DATE>Nov. 13</DATE>. Expected to 
total as much as <MONEY>$30 million</MONEY>, the <PERSON>Wilder</PERSON> collection is among the liveliest 
collections to come up for sale in many years. Exercising a purely personal 
taste that favors literary complexities and emotional punch, <PERSON>Wilder</PERSON> purchased 
exquisitely raunchy nudes by <ORGANIZATION>Austrian Expressionist Egon Schiele</ORGANIZATION>, poetic boxes 
and collages by <PERSON>Joseph Cornell</PERSON> and delightful whimsies by <PERSON>Joan Miro</PERSON>. In the 
<PERSON>Wilder</PERSON> roster of works by 47 artists, <ORGANIZATION>Picasso</ORGANIZATION>'s classical <DATE>1921</DATE> pastel drawing, 
"Tete de Femme," is expected to bring the sale's top price of <MONEY>$5 million</MONEY> to <MONEY>$7 
million</MONEY>. 
</P>
<P>
* The late <PERSON>Edgar Kaufmann Jr.</PERSON>, a <PERSON>Frank Lloyd Wright</PERSON> scholar and heir to a 
<LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION> department store fortune, is known for persuading his father to 
commission <PERSON>Wright</PERSON>'s masterpiece, a house called "Fallingwater," but he was also 
a distinguished collector of art. Sotheby's <DATE>Nov. 15</DATE> sale of 21 Impressionist 
and modern works from his collection is expected to total up to <MONEY>$40 million</MONEY>. 
</P>
<P>
There's a Monet waterlily painting, valued at <MONEY>$7 million</MONEY> to <MONEY>$9 million</MONEY>, an 
early <ORGANIZATION>Mondrian</ORGANIZATION>, called "Facade in Tan and Grey" (<MONEY>$6 million</MONEY> to <MONEY>$8 million</MONEY>) and 
a sprightly <PERSON>Miro</PERSON>, "l'Oiseau au Plumage Deploye Vole Vers l'Arbre Argente "(<MONEY>$4 
million</MONEY> to <MONEY>$5 million</MONEY>). Another painting from the <PERSON>Kaufmann</PERSON> collection, <PERSON>Willem 
de Kooning</PERSON>'s <DATE>1955</DATE> "Interchange" (<MONEY>$4 million</MONEY> to <MONEY>$6 million</MONEY>) is among top 
offerings in Sotheby's contemporary sale on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
* The late <PERSON>Robert B. Mayer</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> clothing retailer, founding member of the 
<ORGANIZATION>Chicago Museum of Contemporary</ORGANIZATION> Art and supporter of the <ORGANIZATION>Art Institute of 
Chicago</ORGANIZATION>, amassed one of the finest private art collections in the country. 
Twenty contemporary pieces from the <PERSON>Mayer</PERSON> collection, for sale at <ORGANIZATION>Christie</ORGANIZATION>'s on 
<DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, include <PERSON>Roy Lichtenstein</PERSON>'s comic-strip style "Torpedo . . . Los!," 
expected to bring <MONEY>$3 million</MONEY> to <MONEY>$4 million</MONEY>, and <PERSON>Jasper Johns</PERSON>' small gray 
painting of numbers, "O Through 9," valued at <MONEY>$2.5 million</MONEY> to <MONEY>$3.5 million</MONEY>. 
</P>
<P>
How does such distinguished ownership figure into the auction houses' 
estimates? Not at all, officials from <ORGANIZATION>Christie's</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby</ORGANIZATION>'s insist. If only 
to protect themselves from being overly optimistic in an overheated market, 
they establish estimates that they say reflect market value, based on sales of 
similar works. 
</P>
<P>
But the two houses compete vigorously for big-name collections and promote them 
to the hilt. The selling of collections includes selling the collectors as 
people of prescience and taste. 
</P>
<P>
Prestigious "single-owner" sales -- auctions that include a number of works 
from a single collection -- are fancy dress occasions with admission by ticket 
and reserved seats for favored clients. 
</P>
<P>
These sales have color-illustrated catalogues, often containing essays about 
the collectors, historical notes and photographs of how the artworks were 
installed in the collectors' homes. Really big sales get hard-cover catalogues. 
Really, really big sales of single paintings -- such as "Irises" and "Au Lapin 
Agile" -- get their own hard-cover books. 
</P>
<P>
Artworks in "single-owner" sales are also sent on carefully plotted 
international tours that include private openings and public viewings. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently the strategy works. Highly publicized "single-owner" sales often 
surpass, even double, their estimates. That success -- coupled with the fear 
that the bubble will burst -- persuades more collectors to sell. 
</P>
<P>
With art pouring out of closets, new collectors emerging in ever larger numbers 
and European buying reportedly on the rise, this year promises to bring more of 
the same. 
</P>
<P>
The strongest note of skepticism about the perpetually escalating art market 
has been voiced over what some observers call artificial prices, pumped up by 
<ORGANIZATION>Sotheby</ORGANIZATION>'s practice of loaning money to their clients for the purchase of art 
from <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby</ORGANIZATION>'s sales. 
</P>
<P>
The most famous case is that of Australian businessman Alan Bond who reportedly 
borrowed about <MONEY>$27 million</MONEY> from <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby</ORGANIZATION>'s to buy "Irises" in <DATE>1987</DATE> and 
subsequently suffered financial setbacks. Although he has made regular payments 
-- after renegotiating the loan -- the painting is safely locked in a Sotheby's 
vault, according to the auction house. To help pay off his loan, Bond has 
consigned "La Promenade," an Impressionist painting by <PERSON>Edouard Manet</PERSON> valued at 
<MONEY>$10 million</MONEY> to <MONEY>$14 million</MONEY>, to <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby</ORGANIZATION>'s <DATE>Nov. 15</DATE> sale -- the same auction that 
features "Au Lapin Agile."

<TEXT>
   <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> auction houses sold more than <MONEY>$1.5 billion</MONEY>
worth of art last year and chalked up their best-selling season
ever thanks to a broader, more educated audience, art dealers said.
   Two Pablo Picasso paintings sold for more than <MONEY>$40 million</MONEY> each
to become the third- and fourth-most expensive paintings ever, but
the not-so-wealthy art lover also contributed to the record sales
by buying works that cost thousands rather than than millions.
   When the final bang of the gavel sounded on <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> art auction
sales for the season, the total came to <MONEY>$1.53 billion</MONEY>, nearly
double last year's total, <PERSON>Leonard</PERSON>'s Annual Price Index of Art
Auctions reported this week.
   The total number of art lots sold was 33,000 in <DATE>1989</DATE>, down by
more than 5,000 from the previous year. Experts said both the
limited art supply and increased consumer interest stoked the
season's record-breaking sales.
   ``When my grandfather ran the business, his clientele was the
very top <PERCENT>5 percent</PERCENT> of the upper class,'' said <PERSON>Abbot William Vose</PERSON>,
president of <ORGANIZATION>Vose Gallery</ORGANIZATION>, which opened in <LOCATION>Providence</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>R.I.</LOCATION>, in
<DATE>1841</DATE> and relocated to <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> <DATE>40 years later</DATE>.
   ``The clientele is very broad-based now, with even the lower
middle-class buying art,'' he said. ``Art education in even grade
schools, up through high schools, has played a good part in
focusing attention on American art and other arts, and has made a
difference in attendance at museums and art shows.''
   <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby's Holdings Inc.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> last year sold the third-and
fourth-top moneymakers ever with ``<PERSON>Yo Picasso</PERSON>,'' a self-portrait of
the artist that earned <MONEY>$47.85 million</MONEY>, and his ``Au Lapin Agile,''
which went for <MONEY>$40.7 million</MONEY>, said <PERSON>Robin Riley-Ahrens</PERSON>, the house's
spokesman.
   Picasso's ``Pierrette's Wedding'' went for <MONEY>$48.9 million</MONEY> in
<DATE>November</DATE> to earn the title of the second-most expensive painting
ever, but it was sold at the Drouot-Montaigne auction house in
<LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> and thus not included in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> figures.
   The world's most expensive painting, <PERSON>Vincent van Gogh</PERSON>'s
``Irises,'' was sold by <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby</ORGANIZATION>'s in <DATE>1987</DATE> for <MONEY>$53.9 million</MONEY>. The
auction house disclosed <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, however, that it lent Australian
tycoon Alan Bond <MONEY>$27 million</MONEY> to buy the <DATE>1889</DATE> painting; that as
collateral Bond posted the picture he was going to buy, and that
Bond has not paid off the loan. Sotheby's said it was abandoning
the loan policy, which many critics say artificially inflates
artwork prices.
   ``About <PERCENT>20 percent</PERCENT> of the art sold at auction went for below
<MONEY>$1,000</MONEY>,'' said <PERSON>Susan Theran</PERSON>, publisher of Leonard's Annual Price
Index, an industry database that provides information annually on
art auction prices.
   ``Art is affordable, and people are finding that out,'' she
said. ``People are developing their tastes and buying books on how
to purchase art.''
   However, sales were still chiefly pushed to their record heights
by purchases in the <MONEY>$1 million-plus</MONEY> market, <PERSON>Theran</PERSON> said.
   Final tally for the <DATE>1989</DATE> selling season showed 240 lots of
artworks worth more than <MONEY>$1 million</MONEY> were sold, compared with 84
similarly priced lots in the previous year, <PERSON>Theran</PERSON> said. Sales for
the 240 lots was <MONEY>$779 million</MONEY>, more than triple the <DATE>1988</DATE> figure of
<MONEY>$213.5 million</MONEY> for the 84 lots.

   Pablo Picasso would have gotten a kick out of
seeing his self-portrait sell for <MONEY>$47.85 million</MONEY> to become the
second most expensive art work ever auctioned, his daughter said.
   ``Yo Picasso,'' painted 88 years ago when the artist was 20, was
last sold in <DATE>1981</DATE> for <MONEY>$5.5 million</MONEY>.
   Its price <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> at <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby's</ORGANIZATION> was more than twice its
pre-sale estimate and was second only to <PERSON>Vincent Van Gogh</PERSON>'s
``Irises,'' which sold for <MONEY>$53.9 million</MONEY> in <DATE>1987</DATE>.
   The <PERSON>Picasso</PERSON> was one of 67 Impressionist, Post-Impressionist and
Modern works that sold for a record total of <MONEY>$204.82 million</MONEY>. The
previous mark for one auction was <MONEY>$117 million</MONEY> at <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby</ORGANIZATION>'s in
<LOCATION>London</LOCATION> in <DATE>April</DATE>.
   The previous record sale for <ORGANIZATION>Picasso</ORGANIZATION>, who died in <DATE>1973</DATE>, was
<MONEY>$38.45 million</MONEY> paid last year for ``Acrobate et Jeune Arlequin.''
   <PERSON>Paloma Picasso</PERSON>, who attended <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>'s sale, said she thought
her father ``would get a kick out of it'' if he knew how much his
self-portrait had brought.
   ``It's in another stratosphere, but it's because there's a lot
of cash around,'' she said. ``It's better that these people use
their money for these paintings rather than planes and bombs.''
   Two bidders made their offers by telephone, upping one another
in increments of a <MONEY>million dollars</MONEY> once the price war got past <MONEY>$30
million</MONEY>. The standing-room-only audience oohed as each offer was
announced and applauded the winning figure.
   Neither bidder was identified. The loser also was the
underbidder when the painting was last sold.
   ``Yo Picasso'' was sold by <PERSON>Wendell Cherry</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Louisville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ky.</LOCATION>,
who heads <ORGANIZATION>Humana Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, the hospital management corporation.
   Records were set <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> for 11 artists besides <ORGANIZATION>Picasso</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>Paul Gauguin</PERSON>'s ``<ORGANIZATION>Mata Mua</ORGANIZATION> (In Olden Times),'' a colorful
Tahitian landscape, sold for <MONEY>$24.2 million</MONEY>. That broke a record set
last month when <PERSON>Gauguin</PERSON>'s ``The Fare Hymenee'' sold for <MONEY>$10.36
million</MONEY>.
   A record <MONEY>$11.55 million</MONEY> for <PERSON>Paul Cezanne</PERSON> was set by his 1893-94
still life ``Pichet et Fruits sur une Table.'' In <DATE>1988</DATE>, his ``La
Cote du Galet, A <LOCATION>Pontoise</LOCATION>'' sold for <MONEY>$9.24 million</MONEY>.
   An abstract landscape by <PERSON>Wassily Kandinsky</PERSON>,
``Herbstlandschaft,'' sold for <MONEY>$3.96 million</MONEY>, a record for the
Russian-born artist whose next highest-priced work,
``Murnau-Landschaft Mit Kirsche 1,'' brought <MONEY>$2.4 million</MONEY> in <DATE>1987</DATE>.
   The <PERSON>Gauguin</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Cezanne</ORGANIZATION> and six other Impressionist and
Post-Impressionist works sold <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> were from the collection of
<PERSON>Jaimie Ortiz-Patino</PERSON>, heir to a Bolivian tin fortune.
   All prices include the auction house's <PERCENT>10 percent</PERCENT> commission.
   Sotheby's and <ORGANIZATION>Christie's</ORGANIZATION>, two of the largest auction houses in
the world, hope to ring up <MONEY>$572 million</MONEY> from 4,472 art works over
12 days of sales that began <DATE>May 2</DATE>.
   ``What do we do for an encore?'' asked <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby</ORGANIZATION>'s auctioneer <PERSON>John
Marion</PERSON>.
   Then he answered his own question when he noted that the art
collection of the heir to the <ORGANIZATION>Campbell Soup Co.</ORGANIZATION> fortune, <PERSON>John
Dorrance</PERSON>, who died <DATE>April 9</DATE>, will be sold at <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby</ORGANIZATION>'s in <DATE>October</DATE>.
   The multi-million dollar collection includes Impressionist and
Post-Impressionist paintings, as well as French 18th-century
furniture and porcelain.

   The <ORGANIZATION>Getty Museum</ORGANIZATION> paid a record <MONEY>$35.2 million</MONEY> for
a 16th-century Florentine portrait of <PERSON>Duke Cosimo de'Medici</PERSON> that
had been displayed in the <ORGANIZATION>Frick Collection</ORGANIZATION> since <DATE>1970</DATE>.
   The price paid <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> was a record for an Old Master, and was
the fifth highest price paid for a painting at the world's two
major auction houses, <ORGANIZATION>Christie's</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby's</ORGANIZATION>.
   Scholars described the work, sometimes called the Halberdier, as
the finest Italian Renaissance painting to be offered at auction in
more than a decade.
   Christie's said many consider it to be the finest Old Master
painting in private hands in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>.
   The previous auction record for an Old Master painting was <MONEY>$10.4
million</MONEY>, paid for <PERSON>Andrea Mantegna</PERSON>'s ``Adoration of the Magi'' in
<LOCATION>London</LOCATION> in <DATE>1985</DATE>.
   The presale estimate for the Medici portrait was <MONEY>$20 million</MONEY>.
The price included a <PERCENT>10 percent</PERCENT> buyer's premium.
   The painting, circa <DATE>1537</DATE>, is by <PERSON>Jacopo da Carucci</PERSON>, who was known
as <ORGANIZATION>Pontormo</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>Chauncey Devereaux Stillman</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> investor and
philanthropist who died <DATE>Jan. 24</DATE>, had lent it to the <LOCATION>Frick</LOCATION> in <DATE>1970</DATE>

   Stillman's lawyers said it would be sold for the benefit of the
<ORGANIZATION>Homeland Foundation</ORGANIZATION>, his charitable organization.
   <PERSON>Charles A. Ryskamp</PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION>Frick</ORGANIZATION>, said in <DATE>March</DATE> that
he was devastated by the painting's removal and expressed concern
that it might leave the country.
   Paintings that have sold for more are: ``Irises'' by <PERSON>Vincent van

   The tiny gallery that bought the world's most
expensive painting for an anonymous client in a <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> auction
has added another trophy to <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s growing collection of
masterpieces.
   The <PERSON>Kobayashi</PERSON> Gallery of <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> bought ``Portrait of <PERSON>Dr.
Gachet</PERSON>,'' one of <PERSON>Vincent Van Gogh</PERSON>'s last paintings, for <MONEY>$82.5
million</MONEY> after a 10-minute auction battle <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> with a telephone
bidder at <ORGANIZATION>Christie</ORGANIZATION>'s auction house. The price includes a <PERCENT>10 percent</PERCENT>
buyer's premium.
   A staff member of <PERSON>Hideto Kobayashi</PERSON>'s one-room gallery in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>'s
fashionable <LOCATION>Ginza</LOCATION> district said the world record purchase, far
surpassing the <MONEY>$53.9 million</MONEY> paid for van Gogh's ``Irises'' at a
<ORGANIZATION>Sotheby</ORGANIZATION>'s auction in <DATE>November 1987</DATE>, came as a surprise.
   ``We weren't prepared for the deluge of reporters and
photographers <TIME>this morning</TIME>,'' said <PERSON>Kasunori Tanabe</PERSON>. ``The price is
amazing. It's as if we bought a dream.''
   <PERSON>Tanabe</PERSON> said the new owner of ``Portrait of <PERSON>Dr. Gachet</PERSON>'' is a
company listed on the first section of the <ORGANIZATION>Tokyo Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>,
but declined to say more.
   In <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Kobayashi</PERSON> told <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Kyodo News Service</ORGANIZATION> that his
client was ``extremely pleased.''
   Kobayashi established an independent gallery in the <LOCATION>Ginza</LOCATION>, home
to hundreds of similar art dealers, 12 years ago after working for
the nearby <ORGANIZATION>Fujii Gallery</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Tanabe</PERSON> said.
   Both galleries are active collectors of Impressionist works.
   With <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>'s purchase, <PERSON>Kobayashi</PERSON> joined a growing list of
record-setting Japanese art buyers.
   The world's third most expensive painting, ``Les Noces de
Pierrette (<ORGANIZATION>Pierrette</ORGANIZATION>'s Wedding)'' by <PERSON>Pablo Picasso</PERSON>, was sold for
<MONEY>$48.9 million</MONEY> in <DATE>November</DATE> to <ORGANIZATION>Nippon Autopolis Co</ORGANIZATION>. The firm said it
planned to make the painting the centerpiece of an auto racing
theme resort.
   Another record smasher, ``Sunflowers,'' by van Gogh, sits in the
corporate headquarters of <ORGANIZATION>Yasuda Marine</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Fire Insurance Co.</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>. The <MONEY>$39.9 million</MONEY> purchase in <DATE>March 1987</DATE> was a world record
at the time and marked a high-profile return of Japanese buyers to
the world art market.
   Several others among the world's 10 most expensive paintings
have gone to Japanese buyers.
   <PERSON>Shigeki Kameyama</PERSON>, owner of the <ORGANIZATION>Mountain Tortoise Gallery</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>, owns at least two prize masterpieces: ``The Mirror,'' by
<ORGANIZATION>Picasso</ORGANIZATION>, bought at <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby</ORGANIZATION>'s for <MONEY>$26.4 million</MONEY> in <DATE>November</DATE>, and
``Interchange,'' by <PERSON>Willem de Kooning</PERSON>, also bought from <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby</ORGANIZATION>'s
in <DATE>November</DATE> for <MONEY>$20.6 million</MONEY>.
   An anonymous buyer, bidding through a <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> department store,
paid <MONEY>$38.46 million</MONEY> for <ORGANIZATION>Picasso</ORGANIZATION>'s ``Acrobat and Young Harlequin''
in a <ORGANIZATION>Christie</ORGANIZATION>'s auction in <DATE>1988</DATE>.
   Japanese dealers and collectors have bought 40 to <PERCENT>50 percent</PERCENT> of
Impressionist works at <ORGANIZATION>Christies</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby</ORGANIZATION>'s auctions in the past
few years.
   Lackluster bidding in the most recent auctions indicates that
the meteoric price increases of the mid- to late-1980s have
plateaued, <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby</ORGANIZATION>'s auctioneer <PERSON>Julian Thompson</PERSON> said in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> <DATE>last
month</DATE>.
   But active Japanese participation at recent auctions indicates
that demand in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> for the world's greatest masterpieces remains
strong, he said.

   <PERSON>Pamela Harriman</PERSON>, wife of the late Ambassador <PERSON>W.
Averell Harriman</PERSON>, will give <PERSON>Vincent van Gogh</PERSON>'s ``Roses'' to the
<ORGANIZATION>National Gallery of Art</ORGANIZATION>, the gallery director said <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
   The painting, which <PERSON>Mrs. Harriman</PERSON> valued at <MONEY>$50 million</MONEY> to <MONEY>$60
million</MONEY>, will be the first van Gogh still life to join the <ORGANIZATION>National
Gallery</ORGANIZATION>'s permanent collection.
   Gallery director <PERSON>J. Carter Brown</PERSON> also announced at a <ORGANIZATION>National
Press Club</ORGANIZATION> luncheon that the gallery had received gifts of three
major <DATE>20th century</DATE> works from the late <PERSON>Rita Schreiber</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>
in memory of her husband, <PERSON>Taft B. Schreiber</PERSON>, a Republican activist
and <ORGANIZATION>MCA Inc.</ORGANIZATION> executive who died in <DATE>1976</DATE>.
   The <PERSON>Schreiber</PERSON> gifts include a <DATE>1924</DATE> painting titled ``Harlequin
Musician'' by <PERSON>Pablo Picasso</PERSON>, ``Woman Seated in an Armchair'' painted
by <PERSON>Henri Matisse</PERSON> in <DATE>1940</DATE> and a <DATE>1927</DATE> bronze sculpture by <PERSON>Constantin
Brancusi</PERSON> titled ``Bird in Space.''
   <PERSON>Brown</PERSON> said ``Roses'' would be displayed as part of a three-month
exhibit devoted to anniversary gifts of art beginning <DATE>March 17,
1991</DATE>, the 50th anniversary of the opening of the gallery's West
Building.
   ``Our hope is that it will set an example for other patriotic
donors,'' he said.
   The gallery will receive complete title to the painting when <PERSON>Mrs.
Harriman</PERSON> dies.
   <PERSON>Mrs. Harriman</PERSON> said her husband, a former Democratic governor of
<LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> and heir to a railroad fortune, bought the van Gogh in
<LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> in <DATE>1930</DATE> with his mother.
   A similar van Gogh still life, ``Irises,'' was sold at auction
for a record-breaking <MONEY>$53.9 million</MONEY> in <DATE>November 1987</DATE>.
   Another van Gogh, ``Sunflowers,'' sold in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> in <DATE>March 1987</DATE>
for <MONEY>$39.9 million</MONEY>, making it the third costliest painting on record
after a Picasso self-portrait, ``Yo Picasso,'' which <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby</ORGANIZATION>'s
auctioned <DATE>May 9</DATE> for <MONEY>$47.8 million</MONEY>.
   ``Roses,'' measuring 28 inches by 35.5 inches, was one of four
still lifes van Gogh completed shortly before he left Saint-Remy,
<LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, in <DATE>1890</DATE>, the year he died.
   <PERSON>Charles S. Moffett</PERSON>, senior curator of paintings at the <ORGANIZATION>National
Gallery</ORGANIZATION> and a van Gogh authority, said ``Roses'' was
``unquestionably one of van Gogh's most important and most beautiful
paintings.''
   Harriman, a former industrialist, banker, roving <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> ambassador
and presidential adviser, died in <DATE>1986</DATE> at age 94. Ambassador to
<LOCATION>London</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> during World War II, Harriman negotiated the <DATE>1963</DATE>
nuclear test ban treaty with the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> and was a leader of
the American delegation at the <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> peace talks that ended the
<LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> War.
   In <DATE>1972</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>W. Averell Harriman Foundation</ORGANIZATION> gave the <ORGANIZATION>National
Gallery</ORGANIZATION> 22 paintings by such artists as <ORGANIZATION>Cezanne</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Degas</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Gaugin</PERSON>,
<ORGANIZATION>Matisse</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Picasso</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Seurat</PERSON>.

<P>
A <MONEY>$32.6-million</MONEY> auction of film maker <PERSON>Billy Wilder</PERSON>'s collection <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> at 
<ORGANIZATION>Christie</ORGANIZATION>'s kicked off a heady week of Impressionist and modern art sales. 
</P>
<P>
Enormous prices are on the agenda this week and <ORGANIZATION>Christie's</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby</ORGANIZATION>'s are 
predicting record sales, but the <PERSON>Wilder</PERSON> affair got off to a shaky start. 
Several pieces brought less than their low estimates and a few others failed to 
sell. The auction soon gathered steam, however, and eventually exceeded 
<ORGANIZATION>Christie</ORGANIZATION>'s most optimistic estimate by more than <MONEY>$1 million</MONEY>. 
</P>
<P>
The 83-year-old collector kept his wit during the fray. "It was less 
nerve-wracking than a film preview," <PERSON>Wilder</PERSON> said, and proclaimed himself 
pleased with the results amid a crowd of friends and fans. 
</P>
<P>
"Head of a Woman," a <DATE>1921</DATE> classical pastel portrait by <PERSON>Pablo Picasso</PERSON>, brought 
the auction's top price of <MONEY>$4.8 million</MONEY> but less than <ORGANIZATION>Christie's</ORGANIZATION> low estimate 
of <MONEY>$5 million</MONEY>. 
</P>
<P>
Two works by <PERSON>Joan Miro</PERSON> more than made up for the <ORGANIZATION>Picasso</ORGANIZATION>. A sprightly <DATE>1936</DATE> 
gouache, "The Farmer and His Wife," valued at <MONEY>$1.5 million</MONEY> to <MONEY>$2 million</MONEY>, 
brought <MONEY>$2.7 million</MONEY> from an unidentified American dealer. "The Star," a <DATE>1927</DATE> 
oil inspired by a dream, commanded <MONEY>$2.6 million</MONEY> -- significantly more than 
<ORGANIZATION>Christie</ORGANIZATION>'s high estimate of <MONEY>$1.6 million</MONEY>. 
</P>
<P>
Seven works sold for more than <MONEY>$1 million</MONEY> each, including <ORGANIZATION>Picasso</ORGANIZATION>'s "Two Nude 
Women and Head of a Woman" (<MONEY>$1.98 million</MONEY>) and <PERSON>Alberto Giacometti</PERSON>'s painted 
bronze sculpture "Standing Woman II" (<MONEY>$1.1 million</MONEY>). 
</P>
<P>
Records were set for 12 artists. <PERSON>Balthus</PERSON>' painting of a teen-age nude, "La 
Toilette," sold to a European dealer for a record <MONEY>$2 million</MONEY>. <ORGANIZATION>Ernst Ludwig 
Kirchner</ORGANIZATION>'s painting "Two Nudes on a Blue Sofa" brought <MONEY>$1.5 million</MONEY>, a high for 
the German Expressionist. 
</P>
<P>
The auction also set records for <ORGANIZATION>Joseph Cornell</ORGANIZATION> (<MONEY>$495,000</MONEY>), <PERSON>Nicolas</PERSON> de Stael 
(<MONEY>$638,000</MONEY>) and <PERSON>Mario Marini</PERSON> (<MONEY>$671,000</MONEY>). 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Wilder</PERSON>, who was born in <LOCATION>Austria</LOCATION> and worked in <LOCATION>Berlin</LOCATION> as a young man, moved to 
<ORGANIZATION>Hollywood</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1934</DATE>. He acquired most of his modern art in the late '40s, '50s 
and early '60s. Those were his prime film-making years, when he directed the 
Academy Award winners "The Lost Weekend," "Sunset Boulevard" and "The 
Apartment," as well as "The Seven Year Itch" and "Some Like It Hot." 
</P>
<P>
Although <PERSON>Wilder</PERSON> lacked the means to buy major paintings by renowned artists, he 
snapped up high-quality works on paper and small sculptures and developed a 
sharp eye for new talent. 
</P>
<P>
The works sold at <ORGANIZATION>Christie</ORGANIZATION>'s range from figurative to abstract and cover nearly 
100 years, but they reflect a fondness for Expressionist nudes, literary twists 
and spicy wit. 
</P>
<P>
Wilder's modern art covered the walls of his former home in <LOCATION>Beverly Hills</LOCATION> and 
his present apartment on <ORGANIZATION>Wilshire Boulevard</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
A <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> contingent including his wife, <LOCATION>Audrey</LOCATION>, actresses <PERSON>Claudette 
Colbert</PERSON> and <PERSON>Angie Dickinson</PERSON> and writer <PERSON>Dominick Dunne</PERSON> watched the auction from 
<ORGANIZATION>Christie</ORGANIZATION>'s boardroom, but <PERSON>Wilder</PERSON> joined the crowd in the sale room. 
</P>
<P>
He has not revealed what he plans to do with his millions. 
</P>
<P>
Impressionist and modern art auctions will continue tonight with a big-ticket 
sale at <ORGANIZATION>Christie's</ORGANIZATION>, including 14 works from the <PERSON>Paul Mellon</PERSON> collection valued 
at <MONEY>$85.5 million</MONEY> to <MONEY>$90 million</MONEY>. Drawings and watercolors will go on the block 
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME> at <ORGANIZATION>Christie's</ORGANIZATION>, followed by relatively low-priced paintings 
and sculptures in the <TIME>afternoon</TIME>. 
</P>
<P>
The auction crowd will move to <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby</ORGANIZATION>'s on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> for the season's 
most highly publicized event -- the sale of <ORGANIZATION>Picasso</ORGANIZATION>'s "Au Lapin Agile." 
Sotheby's officials have predicted that this <DATE>1905</DATE> cafe scene depicting the 
artist as a harlequin may break <ORGANIZATION>Picasso</ORGANIZATION>'s record of <MONEY>$47.9 million</MONEY> and possibly 
bring more than the <MONEY>$53.9 million</MONEY> paid for <PERSON>Vincent van Gogh</PERSON>'s "Irises," the 
world's most expensive artwork.

<P>
A Japanese real estate tycoon paid <MONEY>$48.9 million</MONEY> today to set a world auction 
record for a painting by Spanish artist <PERSON>Pablo Picasso</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
But <ORGANIZATION>Picasso</ORGANIZATION>'s "Les Noces de Pierrette" fell short of expectations that it would 
replace <PERSON>Vincent Van Gogh</PERSON>'s "Irises" as the world's most expensive painting. 
</P>
<P>
Art experts had predicted that the auction, conducted simultaneously in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> 
and <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> by a satellite link-up, would break the <DATE>1987</DATE> Van Gogh record of <MONEY>$53.9 
million</MONEY>. The <ORGANIZATION>Picasso</ORGANIZATION> becomes the world's second most expensive work of art. 
</P>
<P>
The buyer, <PERSON>Tomonori Tsurumaki</PERSON>, representing his firm, <ORGANIZATION>Nippon Autopolis Co.</ORGANIZATION>, 
plans to make the painting the centerpiece in an auto racing theme resort in 
the mountains in southern <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>. He will pay a total of <MONEY>$51.35 million</MONEY> when 
auctioneers fees of <PERCENT>5%</PERCENT> are added to the hammer price. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Paloma Picasso</PERSON>, the artist's daughter, told reporters she was staggered at the 
price. "It's an extraordinary sum; I don't know what my father would have 
thought." 
</P>
<P>
The auction price of <ORGANIZATION>Picasso</ORGANIZATION>'s work has exploded. Today's sale was the third 
time this year one of his works has topped <MONEY>$40 million</MONEY>. 
</P>
<P>
"Les Noces de Pierrette," painted in <DATE>1905</DATE> soon after <ORGANIZATION>Picasso</ORGANIZATION> arrived in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> 
from <LOCATION>Barcelona</LOCATION>, is a figurative work from <ORGANIZATION>Picasso</ORGANIZATION>'s blue period showing a 
harlequin blowing a kiss to a newly wedded bride. 
</P>
<P>
The painting reappeared at a <LOCATION>Stockholm</LOCATION> exhibit last year after being missing 
for several decades. Some thought it had been lost or destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
Bidding at today's auction rose rapidly to <MONEY>$42.6 million</MONEY> when a buyer in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> 
hesitated. The Frenchman's final bid of <MONEY>$46 million</MONEY> was topped by <PERSON>Tsurumaki</PERSON>'s 
final offer of <MONEY>$48.9 million</MONEY>. 
</P>
<P>
French film star <PERSON>Alain Delon</PERSON> embraced the disappointed Frenchman as applause 
broke out at the end of the auction. 
</P>
<P>
Delon said he was mandated by a Japanese friend to bid up to <MONEY>$32 million</MONEY> "but I 
didn't even have a chance to put my hand up." 
</P>
<P>
A <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> appeals court <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> rejected a last-minute attempt to halt the sale 
by the sister of a man who sold the painting to Swedish banker <PERSON>Fredrik Roos</PERSON>, 
who owned it until today. <PERSON>Valerie Goulet</PERSON> claimed her brother did not have the 
right to sell the painting.

million</MONEY>), <PERSON>Pablo Picasso</PERSON>'s "Yo Picasso" (<MONEY>$47.9 million</MONEY>) and <ORGANIZATION>Picasso</ORGANIZATION>'s "Au Lapin 
Agile" (<MONEY>$40.7 million</MONEY>). He has also sold the three priciest works by living 
artists: <PERSON>Willem de Kooning</PERSON>'s "Interchange" (<MONEY>$20.7 million</MONEY>) and <PERSON>Jasper Johns</PERSON>' 
"False Start" (<MONEY>$17 million</MONEY>) and "Two Flags" (<MONEY>$12.1 million</MONEY>). 
</P>
<P>
But <PERSON>Marion</PERSON> is not content. 
</P>
<P>
Because these big sales get all the press, they lead to the misconception that 
auctions are a sport for the ultrarich, he said in a recent interview. In fact, 
more than half of the 200,000-plus lots sold in a year at <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby</ORGANIZATION>'s go for less 
than <MONEY>$5,000</MONEY>; a quarter of them sell for under <MONEY>$1,000</MONEY>. 
</P>
<P>
Marion cites these figures repeatedly in "The Best of Everything: The Insider's 
Guide to Collecting -- for Every Taste and Every Budget" (<ORGANIZATION>Simon &amp; Schuster</ORGANIZATION>: 
<MONEY>$19.95</MONEY>), a new book he wrote with <PERSON>Christopher Andersen</PERSON>. While the book is well 
stocked with anecdotes about the rich and famous, the central message is that 
you don't have to be <PERSON>Malcolm Forbes</PERSON> to become a smart player in the auction 
game. 
</P>
<P>
And smart is definitely the operative word here. "Do your homework," <PERSON>Marion</PERSON> 
counsels in one chapter: "Check out the auction house's reputation," "study the 
catalogue," "check out the merchandise," "ask the experts," "attend an auction 
just to observe." 
</P>
<P>
He also discusses nine criteria for assessing value: authenticity, condition, 
rarity, historic importance and provenance, size, medium, subject matter, 
fashion and aesthetic quality. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, <PERSON>Marion</PERSON> exhorts readers to "set a limit" on the amount they will 
bid before setting foot in an auction room. "Buying on impulse is the single 
biggest mistake any collector can make," he writes. 
</P>
<P>
If this is unexpected advice from a man who wants everyone to collect the 
things that <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby</ORGANIZATION>'s sells, it's actually good for business. Sophisticated 
buyers are the best auction customers in the long run. They don't stop buying 
when their homes are furnished. They refine their collections, branch out, 
trade up and believe their acquisitive passion improves their quality of life. 
</P>
<P>
In short, they become connoisseurs who reap the rewards of making educated 
decisions. And in collecting, "knowledge is truly power," <PERSON>Marion</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
Why buy a new rug or piece of furniture when for roughly the same price you can 
have a more appealing old one that is likely to rise in value, he asked. If you 
build a coherent collection of things you love, you will be surrounded by 
objects that have "special meaning" because you took the trouble to find them 
and learn about them. 
</P>
<P>
But what's available to the aspiring collector who lacks <PERSON>Donald Trump</PERSON>'s bank 
account? Marion lists African and Latin American art, American furniture, 
English salt-glazed stoneware, classic cars and the whole field of collectibles 
among "best bets" in his book. 
</P>
<P>
Collectors don't have to buy at auction, but <PERSON>Marion</PERSON> said that they are missing 
high-quality objects and educational opportunities if they don't. 
</P>
<P>
"Education is the prime reason for our success," <PERSON>Marion</PERSON> said. Dealers used to 
be the primary educators of collectors, but now the major auction houses have 
taken over part of that role by publishing catalogues, making appraisals and 
offering a range of customer services, he said. 
</P>
<P>
As collectors have multiplied, they have edged dealers out of auctions. While 
dealers once bought <PERCENT>60%</PERCENT> of the goods offered at a typical auction and added 
these treasures to their inventories, they now purchase about <PERCENT>40%</PERCENT> and many of 
those sales are ordered by specific clients. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the participation of more and more people, misconceptions about 
auctions persist, <PERSON>Marion</PERSON> said, and that's what persuaded him to write a book. 
He wants his readers to know that you don't have to spend a lot of money to buy 
at auction, you can walk in off the street, you can ask questions without fear 
of ridicule and you can understand what's going on. 
</P>
<P>
But what if you sneeze, scratch your nose or wave at a friend? Will the 
auctioneer think you are bidding on a Renoir? "Only if you are <PERSON>Norton Simon</PERSON>."

<HEAD>Japanese Department Store Buys Picasso's `Acrobat And Young
Harlequin'</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto NY7</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GRAHAM HEATHCOTE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Japanese department store said <DATE>today</DATE> that it
bought <PERSON>Pablo Picasso</PERSON>'s ``Acrobat and Young Harlequin'' for a record
<MONEY>$38.46 million</MONEY> and plans to sell the <ORGANIZATION>Rose Period</ORGANIZATION> masterpiece to a
buyer in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>.
   The pink-and-rose painting of two circus performers sold <DATE>Monday</DATE>
for the highest price ever paid at auction for a work of art created
in this century.
   It also was the third most expensive work of art ever auctioned.
It is surpassed only by two late 19th century paintings by <PERSON>Vincent
van Gogh</PERSON> sold in <DATE>1987</DATE>, ``Irises'' at <MONEY>$53.9 million</MONEY> and
``Sunflowers'' at <MONEY>$41.3 million</MONEY>.
   <PERSON>Yasuhiro Tanaka</PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION>Mitsukoshi Department Store</ORGANIZATION>,
said in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> that its representative <PERSON>Akio Nishino</PERSON> bought the
Picasso painting at the <ORGANIZATION>Christie</ORGANIZATION>'s auction in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> on behalf of
the store.
   ``We bought the painting expecting to sell it to a private buyer
here in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>,'' <PERSON>Tanaka</PERSON> said.
   But he said the store, which is a major importer of art into
<LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, had not decided on specific plans for displaying or selling
the painting.
   Nishino left the crowded saleroom after buying the painting and
slumped in a chair in a private room for 20 minutes.
   He didn't speak to reporters but wore a big smile. A director
said the man was emotionally exhausted.
   ``We offered him a glass of champagne but he didn't like it and
had <ORGANIZATION>Coca-Cola</ORGANIZATION> instead,'' said <PERSON>Mark Wrey</PERSON>, spokesman for the auction
house.
   ``The buyer told me he had bought a most wonderful masterpiece.
He didn't question the price _ he was very excited.''
   <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s imports of art and curios have ballooned in recent years
as increasingly affluent Japanese turn to collecting as a form of
investment.
   <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Yasuda Fire and Marine Insurance Co.</ORGANIZATION> bought Van Gogh's
``Sunflowers'' when it was sold at <ORGANIZATION>Christie</ORGANIZATION>'s in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> in <DATE>March
1987</DATE>. Dealers estimate that at least <PERCENT>30 percent</PERCENT> of worldwide art
sales are to Japanese buyers, often large corporations that buy for
tax-free investment purposes.
   Picasso painted ``Acrobat and Young Harlequin'' in <DATE>1905</DATE> in his
<LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> attic studio at 13 rue Ravignon using gouache, an opaque
watercolor easier to handle than oil paint.
   After being shown in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> in <DATE>1905</DATE>, it found its way into a
German museum and was confiscated by the <ORGANIZATION>Nazis</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1937</DATE> as an example
of decadent art. They sold it at auction in <LOCATION>Switzerland</LOCATION> to a Belgian
collector, and it had been in private hands since.
   Bidding on <DATE>Monday</DATE> opened at <MONEY>$9.2 million</MONEY>, and the painting sold
in 3{ minutes.
   The selling price topped the previous record for a 20th century
painting, <MONEY>$24.75 million</MONEY> paid for <ORGANIZATION>Picasso</ORGANIZATION>'s ``Maternity'' <DATE>Nov. 14</DATE> in
<LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>.
   Auctioneer <PERSON>Charles Allsopp</PERSON> said the price was not exorbitant.
   ``By any standard, <PERSON>Picasso</PERSON> was the towering figure of art in this
century. This picture was from his Rose Period, which is usually
considered his best, and it's the last great work of that series
likely to come on the market,'' <PERSON>Allsopp</PERSON> said.
   ``In the 27 years I've been here, it has gripped more people and
people with a greater variety of tastes than any previous picture.
It has had practically no detractors _ even among those who don't
like Picasso.''
   A picture by the French Impressionist <PERSON>Claude Monet</PERSON>, ``The
Railroad Bridge at <LOCATION>Argenteuil</LOCATION>,'' sold for <MONEY>$12.55 million</MONEY>, also
joining the list of the 10 most expensive works of art sold at
auction.
   In <DATE>June 28</DATE>, another Monet painting, ``In the Field,'' sold at
<ORGANIZATION>Sotheby</ORGANIZATION>'s in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> for <MONEY>$24.90 million</MONEY>.
   <DATE>Monday</DATE>'s auction of 60 works by 40 artists brought <MONEY>$102.01
million</MONEY>, a record for an Impressionist and modern art sale in
<LOCATION>London</LOCATION>. Individual records were set for works by <ORGANIZATION>Picasso</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Paul
Gauguin</PERSON>, <PERSON>Alberto Giacometti</PERSON>, <PERSON>Paul Klee</PERSON> and <PERSON>Paul Signac</PERSON>.

   The bulls are back in the art-auction china shops, predicting higher prices and higher volume than ever before. 
Christie's and <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby's</ORGANIZATION>, the two major <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> houses, are about to offer a large number of impressionist and modern paintings at estimates unheard of even five years ago. 
They are betting that demand for these pictures will be so strong that the market will swallow everything that is thrown at it and prices still will rise -- a lot. 
As art dealer <PERSON>Richard Feigen</PERSON> sees it, "There is unlimited money trying to absorb itself in art." 

   Step right this way. 
More than <MONEY>$600 million</MONEY> of impressionist and modern paintings are about to hit the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> auction block -- far outstripping <DATE>May</DATE>'s four-day <MONEY>$400 million</MONEY> bonanza. 
This season <PERSON>Lorinda de Roulet</PERSON> (sister of <PERSON>John Whitney Payson</PERSON>, for whom "Irises" by <PERSON>Vincent van Gogh</PERSON> was sold for <MONEY>$53.9 million</MONEY> in <DATE>November of 1987</DATE>, to the Australian <PERSON>Alan Bond</PERSON>, who still hasn't taken possession because he hasn't yet paid off the loan <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby</ORGANIZATION>'s offered him at the sale) has consigned another biggie to <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby's</ORGANIZATION>. 
"Au Lapin Agile" is a <DATE>1905</DATE> Rose Period Picasso being billed as "the most important 20th-century picture ever to come up for auction." 
It may sell for more than any previous Picasso -- the record is <MONEY>$47.85 million</MONEY> set in <DATE>May</DATE> for "Self Portrait: Yo Picasso." 

   Sotheby's also weighs in with the <PERSON>John T. Dorrance Jr.</PERSON> collection of impressionists at an estimated <MONEY>$100 million-plus</MONEY> (to be offered tomorrow) and a juicy assortment of paintings from other sources, more than 35 of which are expected to sell in <DATE>November</DATE> for at least <MONEY>$1 million</MONEY> each. 

   Christie's has snagged the 15 impressionist and modern paintings being pruned from <PERSON>Paul Mellon</PERSON>'s vast collection, including the probable <MONEY>$30 million-plus</MONEY> "Rue Mosnier, <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>, Decorated With Flags on <DATE>June 30, 1878</DATE>" by <PERSON>Edouard Manet</PERSON> (purchased by <ORGANIZATION>Mellon</ORGANIZATION> at the <PERSON>Jacob Goldschmidt</PERSON> sale in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> in <DATE>1958</DATE> for <MONEY>$316,400</MONEY>) and a van Gogh, "Trunk of an Old Yew Tree, <LOCATION>Arles</LOCATION>," estimated at <MONEY>$25 million-plus</MONEY>. 

   Other one-owner collections include <PERSON>Billy Wilder</PERSON>'s more modest but choice offerings, and the <PERSON>George N. Richard</PERSON> collection -- piled on top of <ORGANIZATION>Christie</ORGANIZATION>'s estimated <MONEY>$150 million</MONEY> -- <MONEY>$200 million</MONEY> of other impressionist goodies. 
All these will go under the hammer on <DATE>Nov. 13</DATE> and 14. 

   "A strong art market is bringing out paintings I never expected to see on the market," says <PERSON>David Nash</PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby's Fine Arts Division</ORGANIZATION>. 
Some museum directors never expected to see them there either. 
But since the <DATE>1986</DATE> tax laws drastically reduced deductions for the donation of appreciated property and reduced overall tax rates (thereby making deductions less significant), charitable donations to museums, when anyone makes them, are very charitable indeed. 
And given the seductive prices held out by the auction houses, the urge to sell can -- and apparently has -- become irresistible. 

   Of the current group of paintings, it's hard to say which, in the days before tax reform, might have been donated instead of sold. 
No museum director will risk offending potential patrons by publicly airing disappointed hopes. 
<LOCATION>Philadelphia Museum</LOCATION> head <PERSON>Anne d'Harnoncourt</PERSON> insists that even though <PERSON>John Dorrance</PERSON> may have been the chairman of her <ORGANIZATION>Board of Trustees</ORGANIZATION>, "We weren't expecting the pictures we didn't get." 

   Although Sotheby's points out that it is "an international organization" not specifically concerned with potential losses to American museums, others are up in arms: "Donations have always been the main source of increased museum collections," says <PERSON>Edward H. Able Jr.</PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION>American Association of Museums</ORGANIZATION>. 
"Now there is a hemorrhaging of this country's patrimony." 
According to a study conducted by the <ORGANIZATION>Association of Art Museum Directors</ORGANIZATION>, the drop in the dollar value of donated works of art since <DATE>1986</DATE> is more than <PERCENT>50%</PERCENT>. 
"This is just the tip of the iceberg, because no major collector has died recently," says <PERSON>Christopher Burge</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Christie</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>. 
"The next 10 years are going to be a wasteland for American museums." 

   But not for auction houses. 
Their sales have turned into theater for a world audience. 
Even before the sales, the hoopla is well under way. 
Major attractions have out-of-town tryouts. 
"Au Lapin Agile," some of the Mellon paintings, and others went around the world on a series of whistle-stop exhibition tours; <PERSON>Billy Wilder</PERSON>'s pictures went to a party at the <LOCATION>Beverly Hills</LOCATION> Hotel; and the <PERSON>Dorrance</PERSON> paintings hung for five days in the <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> Museum of Art. (Even Sotheby's PR department couldn't have pulled that one off; <PERSON>Dorrance</PERSON>'s executors "requested" it.) 

   At last, however, the warmup is done and the action is about to begin. 
And it will soon be clear whether enough people will be raising those little bidding paddles, no matter what the cost. 
The weak dollar makes our market a playground for foreign bidders, and our sorry balance of trade has given them plenty of dollars to play with. 
"In many ways the Japanese -- particularly Japanese corporations -- dictate art price levels," says <PERSON>Susan Seidel</PERSON> of <PERSON>William Beadleston</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> private dealing concern. 
"They are willing to pay almost anything." 

   But why art? 
Are we talking pure aesthetic appreciation here? 
For many buyers, that still is major motivation. 
But the stakes are now very high and for your <MONEY>$40 million</MONEY> you can buy only the best of what is available -- which may not be the best there is. 
But at least the auction process illustrates so beautifully that everybody else wanted to have it too. 
For some, the social status that can be acquired in this way is the point of the game. 
"They buy the co-op, they buy the cars," says <PERSON>Ms. Seidel</PERSON>. 
"Then they buy `brand names' like Picasso to put on the wall." 

   But at these price levels, confidence in the "investment" potential of major paintings must be playing a part in fueling the collecting frenzy. 
Big-bucks buyers trust that the market will continue its strong surge. 
"In <DATE>October</DATE> of '87 people saw that everything else went down but art went up," <PERSON>Desmond Corcoran</PERSON> of <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Alex Reid &amp; Lefevre Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> gallery points out. 
Since then, the market has continued to rise, but now the size of the estimates seems to be making some people nervous. 
"Zey are crazee]" shrieked one French dealer, reeling from auction estimate sticker shock. 

   In a lower key, <PERSON>Mr. Corcoran</PERSON> finds the world "full of strange speculators" and the auction estimates "incredible," and suggests the <PERSON>Dorrance</PERSON> sale as a sort of early warning system: "These pictures are not absolutely top quality," he says. 
"So if the market absorbs those, what comes three weeks later will do just fine." 

   If all goes well, if the <ORGANIZATION>Picasso</ORGANIZATION> hits <MONEY>$75 million</MONEY>, and <ORGANIZATION>Mellon</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Dorrance</PERSON>, <PERSON>Wilder</PERSON> and the rest get what they bargained for, the uncomfortable, questioning buzz in the art marketplace will trail off into sighs of relief, only to begin anew slightly louder than before, as the cycle starts over in the <DATE>spring</DATE>. 
Because for some, the art market has become a sort of magic beanstalk rising into the clouds at a cartoon rate of speed. 
Nobody knows what is at the top, but they are hoping it is very far away.

artist was 20 years old, was more than twice its pre-sale estimate
and <MONEY>$9.4 million</MONEY> more than the previous record for the Spanish
artist.
   ``It's in another stratosphere, but it's because there's a lot
of cash around,'' <PERSON>Paloma Picasso</PERSON>, the artist's daughter who
attended the auction, said when asked if she thought the bidding
had gotten out of hand.
   ``It's better that these people use their money for these
paintings rather than planes and bombs,'' she said.

than the previous highest price for a <ORGANIZATION>Cezanne</ORGANIZATION>.
   An abstract landscape by <PERSON>Wassili Kandinsky</PERSON>,
``Herbstlandschaft,'' sold for <MONEY>$3.96 million</MONEY>, a record for the
Russian-born artist.
   Other works that commanded prices in the millions were:

   Nearly 140 masterpieces from two formidable
family collections, including a celebrated, <MONEY>$40.7 million</MONEY>
self-portrait by <PERSON>Pablo Picasso</PERSON>, are going on display <DATE>Sunday</DATE> at the
<ORGANIZATION>National Gallery of Art</ORGANIZATION>.
   Opening in the gallery's modernistic East Building is the first
and only <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> exhibition of 85 old masters, impressionists,
post-impressionists and early modern works from the collection of
the late Swiss industrialist, <PERSON>Emil G. Buehrle</PERSON>.
   Appearing simultaneously in the gallery's West Building is the
entire collection of 54 paintings, watercolors and drawings from
the home of millionaire publisher <PERSON>Walter H. Annenberg</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Rancho
Mirage</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, shown together for the first time on a national
tour that began last <DATE>summer</DATE> in <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION>.
   Gallery director <PERSON>J. Carter Brown</PERSON> called the twin exhibitions ``a
fabulous double-header'' and said that ``we may never see in our
lifetime a concentration of art of such quality and importance.''
   First lady <PERSON>Barbara Bush</PERSON>, wearing a white jacket and pearls,
attended a gallery reception in <LOCATION>Annenberg</LOCATION>'s honor <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>
and toured his collection with <PERSON>Brown</PERSON> as her personal guide. She is
said to be an admirer of French impressionist paintings.
   <PERSON>Brown</PERSON> said the <PERSON>Buehrle</PERSON> exhibit was drawn from 321 works _ many
of them rarely seen in public _ that comprise ``one of the greatest
private collections to have been created in the <DATE>20th century</DATE>.''
   The 38 Italian, Dutch, French and Spanish artists represented in
the show range from <PERSON>Frans Hals</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Francisco Goya</ORGANIZATION> to impressionists
<PERSON>Edouard Manet</PERSON>, <PERSON>Camille Pissarro</PERSON>, <PERSON>Edgar Degas</PERSON>, <PERSON>Paul Cezanne</PERSON>, <PERSON>Claude
Monet</PERSON>, <PERSON>Paul Gauguin</PERSON> and <PERSON>Vincent van Gogh</PERSON>.
   Among the <DATE>20th century</DATE> masters in the exhibit, titled ``The
Passionate Eye: Impressionist and Other Master Paintings from the
Collection of <PERSON>Emil G. Buehrle</PERSON>,'' are <PERSON>Henri Matisse</PERSON>, <PERSON>Georges Braque</PERSON>,
<ORGANIZATION>Picasso</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Franz Marc</PERSON> and <PERSON>Wassily Kandinsky</PERSON>.
   <PERSON>Brown</PERSON> said <PERSON>Annenberg</PERSON>, a philanthropist, publisher and former
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>, and his wife, <PERSON>Leonore</PERSON>, had ``assembled
one of the world's greatest private collections of impressionist
and post-impressionist art.''
   The <ORGANIZATION>National Gallery</ORGANIZATION> show includes three recent Annenberg
acquisitions that did not appear in the <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> exhibit,
<PERSON>Braque</PERSON>'s ``The Studio,'' <PERSON>Henri Fantin-Latour</PERSON>'s ``Asters and Fruit
on a Table'' and the Picasso self-portrait, ``Au Lapin Agile.''
   Annenberg bought the <DATE>1905</DATE> Picasso painting at <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby</ORGANIZATION>'s in <LOCATION>New
York</LOCATION> last <DATE>November</DATE> for <MONEY>$40.7 million</MONEY>, the third most expensive
artwork ever sold at auction.
   Since he sold his publishing empire to <ORGANIZATION>Rupert Murdoch</ORGANIZATION> for <MONEY>$3
billion</MONEY> in <DATE>1988</DATE>, the 82-year-old collector has accelerated his art
purchases amid intense speculation over the eventual fate of his
masterpieces.
   If <PERSON>Annenberg</PERSON> leaves his collection to a museum, the <ORGANIZATION>National
Gallery</ORGANIZATION> is considered a likely candidate, along with the
Metropolitan Museum of Art in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> Museum of
Art and possibly the <LOCATION>Los Angeles County</LOCATION> Museum of Art.
   
   
   Brown ducked a reporter's question last week about the <ORGANIZATION>National
Gallery</ORGANIZATION>'s chances of acquiring the Annenberg collection, which
includes eight Cezannes, five van Goghs, six Monets and other
paintings by <LOCATION>Degas</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Gauguin</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Matisse</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Pierre-Auguste Renoir</ORGANIZATION>. The
show also includes an Annenberg portrait by <PERSON>Andrew Wyeth</PERSON> and a
montage by <PERSON>Romare Bearden</PERSON> of the ``Roots'' television miniseries
that <PERSON>Annenberg</PERSON> commissioned for the cover of TV Guide.
   Americans will never have another chance to view the Buehrle
collection after its current world tour, unless they travel to the
family home in <LOCATION>Zurich</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Switzerland</LOCATION>. When the tour ends, the family
says it will retire the collection from international lending.
   The Buehrle show, underwritten by <ORGANIZATION>Martin Marietta Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, will
remain until <DATE>July 15</DATE>. It also will appear at the <ORGANIZATION>Montreal Museum of
Fine Arts</ORGANIZATION>, <DATE>Aug. 3</DATE> through <DATE>Oct. 14</DATE>; the <LOCATION>Yokohama</LOCATION> Museum of Art in
<LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, <DATE>Nov. 2</DATE> to <DATE>Jan. 13, 1991</DATE>; and the <ORGANIZATION>Royal Academy of Arts</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, <DATE>Feb. 1</DATE> to <DATE>April 14</DATE>.
   ``Masterpieces of Impressionism and Post-Impressionism: The
Annenberg Collection'' will appear at the <ORGANIZATION>National Gallery</ORGANIZATION> through
<DATE>Aug. 5</DATE>, and at the <LOCATION>Los Angeles County</LOCATION> Museum of Art from <DATE>Aug. 16</DATE>
through <DATE>Nov. 11</DATE>. It will appear at <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>'s Metropolitan Museum
next <DATE>summer</DATE>.
   The exhibition is underwritten by the <ORGANIZATION>GTE Corp</ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Picasso Bought by Japanese For $48.9 Million</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Japanese again reached into the upper echelons
of the world art market <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, outbidding a Parisian dealer to
buy a Picasso masterpiece for <MONEY>$48.9 million</MONEY> _ a record for a work
by the artist.
   ``Pierrette's Wedding,'' a long-disappeared masterpiece from
<ORGANIZATION>Picasso</ORGANIZATION>'s famed blue period, was bought by <ORGANIZATION>Nippon Autopolis Co.</ORGANIZATION> in
an auction linking bidders in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> by live satellite TV.
   Action at the Drouot-Montaigne auction house was a tense duel
between an unidentified Japanese bidder in <LOCATION>Toyko</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Herve
Odermatt</PERSON>, a well-known <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> art dealer.
   When the bidding topped <PERSON>Odermatt</PERSON>'s offer of <MONEY>$45.9 million</MONEY>, he
paused for several seconds. The standing-room-only room packed with
celebrities fell silent.
   Odermatt finally shook his gray head, indicating he would go no
higher. Auctioneer <PERSON>Jean-Claude Binoche</PERSON> banged the gavel, and the
painting belonged to the Japanese company.
   ``Of course I'm very disappointed, especially since I was so
close to getting it,'' <PERSON>Odermatt</PERSON> said in an interview. ``During the
few seconds I hesitated _ and I knew everyone was waiting _ I kept
thinking about the condition of the painting. That's what finally
made me decide to let it go.''
   <PERSON>Odermatt</PERSON> said pre-sale estimates that the painting would go for
<MONEY>$50 million</MONEY> to <MONEY>$70 million</MONEY> were not justified.
   ``I spent half an hour <TIME>last night</TIME> examining the work, and it was
worn and awfully varnished,'' he said. ``If it had been in perfect
condition, the sky was the limit.''
   The poignant group portrait painted in <DATE>1905</DATE> will have a new home
in a specially built museum located in an auto-racing theme resort
in the mountains of southern <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>.
   ``We felt we absolutely must have the real thing, a real
masterpiece like this for our museum,'' said <PERSON>Takeshi Inaba</PERSON>, senior
managing director of <ORGANIZATION>Nippon Autopolis</ORGANIZATION>. ``We're very happy to have
bought the painting.''
   The previous Picasso record was held by ``Yo Picasso,'' which
sold for <MONEY>$47.85 million</MONEY> at <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby</ORGANIZATION>'s in <DATE>May</DATE>.
   The record for any work of art _ <MONEY>$53.9 million dollars</MONEY> _ was set
in <DATE>1987</DATE> for <PERSON>Vincent Van Gogh</PERSON>'s ``Irises.''
   <DATE>Thursday</DATE>'s sale also included a series of 26 paintings by
American pop artist <PERSON>Andy Warhol</PERSON> titled ``Ladies and Gentlemen.''
They were sold in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> for prices ranging from between one-half to
two-thirds their pre-sale estimates.
   ``It was a big mistake to auction the Warhols in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>,'' said French collector <PERSON>Alain Lesieutre</PERSON>. ``They would have
brought top dollar in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>.''
   Lesieutre called the price paid for the Picasso ridiculously low.
   ``It's a gift, a giveaway. It's a masterpiece and should have
brought much more, but the French are afraid of big money,'' he
said.
   On hand for the sale was <ORGANIZATION>Picasso</ORGANIZATION>'s daughter, <PERSON>Paloma</PERSON>, who blamed
the lack of excitement and relatively low price on the presence of
TV cameras. ``The atmosphere was cold,'' she said.
   ``Pierrette's Wedding'' is considered one of <ORGANIZATION>Picasso</ORGANIZATION>'s most
important paintings because of its unusually large size, its
hauntingly beautiful blues and pinks, and its harlequin theme.
   The painting shows six figures, probably circus performers,
sitting around a table celebrating with an unsmiling newlywed
couple. The bride, her head draped with a Spanish-style mantilla,
has eyes only for her lover, whom she has abandoned to marry an
older, richer man pictured in a top hat.
   ``It's a transitional painting that announces all the colors and
forms that will dominate <PERSON>Picasso</PERSON>'s works for years to come,'' said
<PERSON>Isabelle de Wavrin</PERSON>, art critic for Beaux Arts Magazine.
   The painting was put up for sale by Swedish industrialist
<PERSON>Frederik Roos</PERSON>, who acquired it in <DATE>1988</DATE>. The painting was granted a
visa to leave <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> only after <PERSON>Roos</PERSON> donated another Picasso from
the blue period, ``La Celestine,'' to the <LOCATION>Louvre</LOCATION>.
   Although art historians are familiar with the dozens of sketches
<PERSON>Picasso</PERSON> drew in preparation for ``Pierrette's Wedding,'' the final
work disappeared years ago, changing hands many times before
surfacing in <DATE>1988</DATE> in a Picasso retrospective.

FIRST COURSE FOR A FALL ART FEAST;

<P>
SOTHEBY'S TO SELL WORKS FROM LATE SOUP MAGNATE'S COLLECTION 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The heat of <DATE>summer</DATE> is still very much with us, but the sellers and buyers of 
the big-ticket art auction circuit are already looking ahead to a sizzling fall 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Evidence of that development is on view at <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>Beverly Hills</LOCATION>, which has 
unveiled a high-end sampling of a <MONEY>$100-million</MONEY> auction upcoming in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. 
The local preview, continuing through <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, features 24 Impressionist 
paintings from the collection of the late <PERSON>John T. Dorrance Jr.</PERSON>, the former 
chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>Campbell Soup Co</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
A late <PERSON>Vincent van Gogh</PERSON> painting, depicting a woman awaiting the return of her 
sailor husband, and one of <PERSON>Claude Monet</PERSON>'s "Haystack" paintings are the most 
expensive works exhibited. The <LOCATION>Van Gogh</LOCATION> is valued at <MONEY>$10 million</MONEY> to 
</P>
<P>
<MONEY>$15 million</MONEY>; the <ORGANIZATION>Monet</ORGANIZATION> is expected to bring between <MONEY>$7 million</MONEY> and <MONEY>$9 million</MONEY>. 
Big bucks, but not enough to surpass <PERSON>Van Gogh</PERSON>'s record of <MONEY>$53.9 million</MONEY> (for 
"Irises") or Monet's record of <MONEY>$24.5 million</MONEY> (for "In the Prairie"). 
</P>
<P>
The auction itself is billed as a potential record-breaker, however. Sotheby's 
expects the four-day sale (<DATE>Oct. 18-21</DATE>) of about 1,000 objects to exceed 
<ORGANIZATION>Christie</ORGANIZATION>'s <MONEY>$85-million</MONEY> auction of 28 Impressionist and modern paintings from 
the <LOCATION>William</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Edith Mayer Goetz</PERSON> collection. The <PERSON>Goetz</PERSON> sale in <DATE>1988</DATE> holds the 
record for a single collection sold at auction. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Dorrance</PERSON>, who died in <DATE>April</DATE>, collected a vast array of fine and decorative arts 
-- from Old Master paintings to European ceramics, French and English 
furniture, silver and Chinese jade. The local exhibition will showcase only the 
most valuable pieces, the Impressionist paintings that form the centerpiece of 
the collection. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a true Impressionist collection. It represents all of the 
Impressionist artists, most of them with very strong work," said <PERSON>Diana D. 
Brooks</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby's North America</ORGANIZATION>. "You rarely see in one collection 
works by <ORGANIZATION>Renoir</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Degas</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Monet</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Gauguin</LOCATION>, Fantin-Latour -- the whole gamut -- and 
then continue into the 20th Century with <PERSON>Picasso</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Matisse</ORGANIZATION>." 
</P>
<P>
Despite its wide range, the collection "fits together well" and shows a 
"consistency of taste," <PERSON>Brooks</PERSON> said. One reason is that many of the works were 
screened by the eye of a single vendor. Dorrance bought most of the paintings 
from <PERSON>Nicholas</PERSON> and <PERSON>William Acquavella</PERSON>, at their <PERSON>Acquavella Galleries</PERSON> in <LOCATION>New 
York</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Brooks</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
The <PERSON>Van Gogh</PERSON>, "L'Homme est en Mer," depicts a woman rocking her baby and gazing 
into a fire. The artist painted it in <DATE>1889</DATE>, the year before his death, while 
incarcerated at a mental asylum in <ORGANIZATION>Saint-Remy</ORGANIZATION>. The 26x20-inch oil was done 
after a reproduction of a painting, probably sent to <PERSON>Van Gogh</PERSON> by his brother 
Theo. Van Gogh often worked from reproductions at Saint-Remy, but he 
interpreted loosely and added his own color. In <DATE>October, 1989</DATE>, he wrote to 
Theo, "I have copied that 'Woman With a Child Sitting by a <LOCATION>Hearth</LOCATION>,' by Mme. 
Dumont-Breton, almost all in violet. I am certainly going on copying, that will 
give me a collection of my own, and when this is large and complete enough, I 
shall give the whole to a school." 
</P>
<P>
"Meules, Effet de Neige, le Matin" is part of Monet's renowned series of 
haystack paintings, depicting stacks of grain near his property at <LOCATION>Giverny</LOCATION> in 
different seasons and at various times of day. This particular canvas was 
painted on a winter morning in <DATE>1891</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Among the other top lots in the local exhibition are "Au Moulin Rouge," a <DATE>1901</DATE> 
cabaret scene by <PERSON>Pablo Picasso</PERSON>, and <ORGANIZATION>Monet</ORGANIZATION>'s <DATE>1877</DATE> landscape, "La Berge a 
<LOCATION>Argenteuil</LOCATION>" (both valued at <MONEY>$6 million</MONEY> to <MONEY>$8 million</MONEY>). Another Monet landscape 
on view, "Bords de la <LOCATION>Seine</LOCATION>, un <PERSON>Coin de Berge</PERSON>," is expected to bring between <MONEY>$5 
million</MONEY> and <MONEY>$7 million</MONEY>. Two other paintings are each valued at <MONEY>$4 million</MONEY> to <MONEY>$5 
million</MONEY>: "Danseuses" (circa 1895-1900), one of <PERSON>Edgar Degas</PERSON>' trademark paintings 
of dancers, and <PERSON>Henri Mastisse</PERSON>'s "Femme a l'Ombrelle Rouge, Assise de Profil" 
(circa 1919-20), depicting a seated woman on a balcony, seen through the French 
doors of a Nice hotel room. 
</P>
<P>
Dorrance, whose father, <PERSON>John T. Dorrance</PERSON>, invented condensed soup, was chairman 
of <ORGANIZATION>Campbell Soup Co.</ORGANIZATION> for 22 years before his retirement in <DATE>1984</DATE>. He collected 
art over a period of about 30 years, acquiring most of his Impressionist 
pictures in the '60s and <DATE>'70s</DATE>. The collection has been well known in art 
circles. <PERSON>Dorrance</PERSON> was chairman of the <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> Museum of Art at his death 
and he occasionally loaned works to traveling exhibitions. His <ORGANIZATION>Picasso</ORGANIZATION>, "Au 
<PERSON>Moulin Rouge</PERSON>," was in the Museum of Modern Art's massive <ORGANIZATION>Picasso</ORGANIZATION> retrospective 
in <DATE>1980</DATE> and <ORGANIZATION>Matisse</ORGANIZATION>'s "Femme a l'Ombrelle Rouge" appeared at the <ORGANIZATION>National 
Gallery</ORGANIZATION>'s 1986-87 exhibition, "<PERSON>Henri Matisse</PERSON>, the Early Years in Nice." 
</P>
<P>
Dorrance displayed most of his collection at his home in <LOCATION>Gladwyne</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pa</LOCATION>. He 
donated some works of art to the <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> Museum of Art during his 
lifetime, but gave only a few ceramic pieces to the museum at his death, <PERSON>Brooks</PERSON> 
said. Except for those ceramics and some porcelains kept by family members, his 
entire collection will go on the block in <DATE>October</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibition at <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby's</ORGANIZATION>, 308 <ORGANIZATION>N. Rodeo Drive</ORGANIZATION>, is open from <TIME>10 a.m.</TIME> to <TIME>5 p.m.</TIME> 
<DATE>today through Saturday</DATE> and <DATE>Monday</DATE> and <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>; <DATE>Sunday</DATE> hours are 1 to <TIME>5 p.m</TIME>. The 
show is the first event in Sotheby's recently doubled exhibition space. The new 
galleries will be used for lectures, luncheons and dinners, as well as 
exhibitions, to more firmly establish <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby</ORGANIZATION>'s presence in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Brooks</PERSON> 
said. 
</P>
<P>
After leaving <LOCATION>Beverly Hills</LOCATION>, the <PERSON>Dorrance</PERSON> preview will travel to <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Zurich</LOCATION>, 
<LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION>. The entire collection will go on view in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> a few 
days before the mid-October auction.

<HL> Van Gogh Work,

Record Sale Price

   Sotheby's auctioned off <PERSON>Vincent van Gogh</PERSON>'s painting "Irises" for <MONEY>$53.9 million</MONEY>, a world record at auction. 

   The price far exceeds the previous record of <MONEY>$39.9 million</MONEY> paid for van Gogh's "Sunflowers" last <DATE>March</DATE> in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, proving again that art and stock have little in common. 

   The crowd in the packed sale room cheered and applauded wildly as the final price was reached. 
The buyer's name wasn't disclosed and bidding for at least the last <MONEY>$20 million</MONEY> was a contest between two people on the telephone. 

   Sotheby's would say only that the van Gogh was bought by a European agent for an anonymous collector "somewhere in the world." 
The price includes a <PERCENT>10%</PERCENT> sales commission. 

   The seller of the painting, <PERSON>John Whitney Payson</PERSON>, said at a news conference after the sale that he was "euphoric." 
<PERSON>Mr. Payson</PERSON>, who said his mother had paid <MONEY>$84,000</MONEY> for the painting in <DATE>1947</DATE>, said that he is giving most of the proceeds to various charities. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Payson</PERSON>'s mother, <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION> philanthropist <PERSON>Joan Whitney Payson</PERSON>, owned the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> Mets baseball team until her death in <DATE>1975</DATE>. 
After she died, the painting was displayed at <ORGANIZATION>Westbrook College</ORGANIZATION> in suburban <LOCATION>Portland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION>, in a gallery that <PERSON>Mr. Payson</PERSON> built in her memory. 

   "Irises," a 28-by-36 5/8-inch oil, depicts a patch of purple irises and one white bloom in a garden. 
The work was painted in <DATE>1889</DATE> while van Gogh was a voluntary patient at an asylum for the insane in Saint-Remy de <LOCATION>Provence</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, where he lived until his suicide in <DATE>1890</DATE> at 37 years old. 

   Journalists from around the world, including two television crews from <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, attended the auction. 
Celebrities present included <PERSON>Andy Williams</PERSON>, <PERSON>Bianca Jagger</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jack Nicholson</PERSON>. 

   <PERSON>John L. Marion</PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby's North America</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby's Holdings Inc.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, said after the sale: "I was telling everybody that this painting ("Irises") would transcend the stock market. 
There is no other opportunity to purchase something like this." 

   After selling the van Gogh, Lot 25 of 100 artworks sold, <PERSON>Mr. Marion</PERSON>, who was the auctioneer, had trouble quieting the crowd. 
"Well, back to earth folks," he said, and indeed it was. 
While the evening's total sale of <MONEY>$110.2 million</MONEY> was an auction record, there were 25 works that didn't sell, including some by <PERSON>Henri Matisse</PERSON> and <PERSON>Pablo Picasso</PERSON>. 

   Before the sale, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> art dealer <PERSON>Stephen Hahn</PERSON> said whatever the price it "won't have an effect on the art market, it is one single picture and a far better painting than `Sunflowers.' " <PERSON>Mr Hahn</PERSON> added: "We still had a rather shocking period for the stock market and that has to show up sometime." 

   On his way out, <PERSON>Mr. Nicholson</PERSON> said to a woman seated next to him: "Just say I wouldn't pay a penny over <MONEY>$32 million</MONEY> and let it go at that."

   A Japanese department store bought <PERSON>Pablo Picasso</PERSON>'s
``Acrobat and Young Harlequin'' for <MONEY>$38.46 million</MONEY> <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> at
<ORGANIZATION>Christie's</ORGANIZATION>, the highest price ever paid at auction for a <DATE>20th
century</DATE> work of art.
   The painting was purchased by the <ORGANIZATION>Mitsukoshi Department Store</ORGANIZATION>,
store spokesman <PERSON>Yasuhiro Tanaka</PERSON> said in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>.
   ``We bought the painting expecting to sell it to a private buyer
here in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>,'' <PERSON>Tanaka</PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION>Mitsukoshi</ORGANIZATION>, a major importer of art,
has not yet decided on specific plans for the display or sale of the
painting, <PERSON>Tanaka</PERSON> said.
   A picture by the French Impressionist <PERSON>Claude Monet</PERSON>, ``The
Railroad Bridge at <LOCATION>Argenteuil</LOCATION>,'' sold for <MONEY>$12.55 million</MONEY>, also
joining the list of the 10 most expensive works of art sold at
auction.
   In <DATE>June 28</DATE>, another Monet painting, ``In the Field,'' sold at
<ORGANIZATION>Sotheby</ORGANIZATION>'s in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> for <MONEY>$24.90 million</MONEY>.
   Spokesmen for the auction house did not disclose the purchaser or
the seller of the Picasso painting. They only identified the seller
as a private owner.
   The <DATE>1905</DATE> work from the artist's Rose Period was sold in 3{
minutes. Bidding opened at <MONEY>5 million pounds</MONEY> (<MONEY>$9.2 million</MONEY>) and ended
at <MONEY>20.9 million pounds</MONEY> (<MONEY>$38.46 million</MONEY>). The price topped the
previous record for a 20th century painting, <MONEY>$24.75 million</MONEY> paid for
<ORGANIZATION>Picasso</ORGANIZATION>'s ``Maternity'' <DATE>Nov. 14</DATE> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>.
   <DATE>Monday</DATE>'s auction of 60 works by 40 artists brought <MONEY>55.44 million
pounds</MONEY> (<MONEY>$102.01 million</MONEY>), a record for an Impressionist and modern
art sale in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>. Individual records were set for works by
<ORGANIZATION>Picasso</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Paul Gauguin</PERSON>, <PERSON>Alberto Giacometti</PERSON>, <PERSON>Paul Klee</PERSON> and <PERSON>Paul Signac</PERSON>.
   Christie's had offered 69 paintings for sale, but nine were
withdrawn or did not reach the minimums set by the owners.
   After being shown in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> in <DATE>1905</DATE>, ``Acrobat and Young
Harlequin'' found its way into a German museum and was confiscated
by the <ORGANIZATION>Nazis</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1937</DATE> as an example of decadent art. They sold it at
auction in <LOCATION>Switzerland</LOCATION> to a Belgian collector and it had been in
private hands since.
   <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s imports of art and curios have ballooned in recent years
as increasingly affluent Japanese turn to collecting as a form of
investment.
   In <DATE>March 1987</DATE>, <PERSON>Vincent Van Gogh</PERSON>'s ``Sunflowers,'' painted in
<DATE>1889</DATE>, sold for <MONEY>$39.9 million</MONEY> at <ORGANIZATION>Christie</ORGANIZATION>'s in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> to <ORGANIZATION>Yasuda Fire
and Marine Insurance Co.</ORGANIZATION>, a Japanese firm.
   Dealers estimate that at least <PERCENT>30 percent</PERCENT> of worldwide art sales
are to Japanese buyers _ often large corporations that buy for
tax-free investment purposes.
   Picasso did the painting in <DATE>1905</DATE> in his <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> attic studio at 13
rue Ravignon using gouache, an opaque watercolor easier to handle
than oil paint.
   Auctioneer <PERSON>Charles Allsopp</PERSON> said the price paid for the painting
was by no means exorbitant.
   ``By any standard, <PERSON>Picasso</PERSON> was the towering figure of art in this
century. This picture was from his Rose Period, which is usually
considered his best, and it's the last great work of that series

   ``In the 27 years I've been here, it has gripped more people and
people with a greater variety of tastes than any previous picture.
It has had practically no detractors _ even among those who don't

<TEXT>
   A private Latin American collector paid nearly
<MONEY>$25 million</MONEY> at auction for an early <PERSON>Pablo Picasso</PERSON> painting of a
mother kissing her son's upturned face, setting a record for a 20th
century work of art.
   ``Maternity,'' from the artist's blue period, sold <DATE>Monday</DATE> at
<ORGANIZATION>Christie's</ORGANIZATION> for twice its estimate, making it the third-highest price
ever paid for a work of art, behind <PERSON>Vincent Van Gogh</PERSON>'s ``Irises''
and ``Sunflowers.''
   The <DATE>1901</DATE> oil on canvas was one of 28 post-Impressionist and
modern works on sale from the collection of <PERSON>William Goetz</PERSON>, a
<ORGANIZATION>Hollywood</ORGANIZATION> motion picture executive, and his wife <PERSON>Edith</PERSON>, the daughter
of film mogul, <PERSON>Louis B. Mayer</PERSON>.
   The 28 lots, all of which sold, fetched <MONEY>$85,024,500</MONEY> _ a record
for a single owner's sale at auction.
   ``This may well be the sale of the century,'' said <PERSON>Christie</PERSON>'s
president <PERSON>Christopher J. Burge</PERSON>, who presided over the auction.
   ``Tonight's auction was ripe for success _ unsurpassingly
beautiful works of art, a fiercely competitive market, and a
renowned provenance,'' he said.
   Earlier, <PERSON>Burge</PERSON> had predicted that the sale would fetch about <MONEY>$50
million</MONEY>.
   The Goetzes built their collection _ generally considered one of
the best of its kind _ during the <DATE>1940s</DATE> and <DATE>1950s</DATE>. Until this
<DATE>summer</DATE>, their paintings hung in their <LOCATION>Holmby Hills</LOCATION> mansion in
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, where the couple once entertained lavishly. He died in
<DATE>1969</DATE>; she died in <DATE>June</DATE> at the age of 82.
   After intense bidding, ``Maternity'' sold to an unidentified
Latin American collector, whose winning bid was placed by telephone.
The painting was expected to sell for <MONEY>$10 million</MONEY>.
   It depicts a blue-robed mother in a high-backed chair, with a
scissors and sewing basket at her feet. The child, standing next to
her, has a ball in his hands.
   The auction house described the painting as a ``majestic, tender
but unsentimental affirmation of maternal love.''
   ``It's a great, very rare picture,'' <PERSON>Burge</PERSON> said. ``It was a
unique opportunity to buy an early blue period picture'' of
<ORGANIZATION>Picasso</ORGANIZATION>'s, who painted it when he was 20, he added.
   When <PERSON>Burge</PERSON> brought the hammer down on the <MONEY>$24.75 million</MONEY> bid, the
crowd broke into applause.
   ``Irises'' sold for <MONEY>$53.9 million</MONEY> in <DATE>November 1987</DATE>. A few months
earlier, Van Gogh's ``Sunflowers'' sold for <MONEY>$39.9 million</MONEY>.
   The second-highest priced work sold at <DATE>Monday</DATE>'s auction was
<PERSON>Claude Monet</PERSON>'s ``The Beach at <LOCATION>Trouville</LOCATION>,'' an <DATE>1870</DATE> oil on canvas,
which went for <MONEY>$10.78 million</MONEY>.
   The third-highest priced piece was <PERSON>Edgar Degas</PERSON>' ``Little Dancer
At 14 Years,'' a statue that sold for <MONEY>$10,175,000</MONEY>, a new record for
the artist. The statue depicts a dancer in polychromed bronze; she
wears a muslin skirt and her hair is tied with a satin ribbon.
   Eight artist's records were set during the auction; they were for
<ORGANIZATION>Picasso</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Degas</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Pierre Bonnard</PERSON>, <PERSON>Henri Fantin-Latour</PERSON>, <PERSON>Marie
Laurencin</PERSON>, <PERSON>Alfred Sisley</PERSON>, <PERSON>Chaim Soutine</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Edouard Vuillard</ORGANIZATION>.
   All prices include a <PERCENT>10 percent</PERCENT> commission paid by the buyer to
the auction house.

   Investigators on <DATE>Thursday</DATE> recovered <MONEY>$17
million</MONEY> in artworks stolen from <LOCATION>Pablo Picasso</LOCATION>'s granddaughter,
finding them at the home of a restaurateur, who was then arrested,
police said.
   Two other men _ both security guards at <ORGANIZATION>Marina Picasso</ORGANIZATION>'s villa
in <LOCATION>Cannes</LOCATION> _ also have been arrested in the theft of the 13 works on
<DATE>Sunday</DATE>, police said.
   The restaurateur, <PERSON>Fernand Laugier</PERSON>, 47, was arrested in nearby Le
Pradet and charged with fencing stolen goods. The security guards,
<PERSON>Serge Clouzeau</PERSON> and <PERSON>Daniel Jaguin</PERSON>, were charged with serious theft.
All three men remained jailed <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>.
   Clouzeau was on vacation when the theft took place <DATE>Sunday</DATE>
<TIME>morning</TIME> and <PERSON>Jaguin</PERSON> had gone shopping for a loaf of bread, leaving
the villa unguarded for 40 minutes. <PERSON>Ms. Picasso</PERSON> was not home.
   Police identified the missing works only as seven paintings by
<PERSON>Pablo Picasso</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Breughel</LOCATION>, an <PERSON>Odilon Redon</PERSON>, three lesser-known <DATE>19th
century</DATE> works and a bust by sculptor <PERSON>August Rodin</PERSON>.
   The works have an estimated value of <MONEY>$17 million</MONEY>. All were
recovered <DATE>Thursday</DATE> and transferred to Nice, where the investigation
continues, police said.
   <PERSON>Ms. Picasso</PERSON> was spending the weekend in the Alpine town of
<LOCATION>Megeve</LOCATION> when the theft occurred at her 1900s-style <ORGANIZATION>Pavillon de Flore</ORGANIZATION>
in the <LOCATION>Basse Californie</LOCATION> section of <LOCATION>Cannes</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Ms. Picasso</PERSON> has made no public comment since returning to <LOCATION>Cannes</LOCATION>
on <DATE>Monday</DATE>. She is the daughter of <PERSON>Paul Picasso</PERSON>, the painter's son,
and his first wife, <PERSON>Olga Kokhlova</PERSON>.
   Investigators with the Nice police said early in the case that
all signs pointed to someone with intimate knowledge of the
property.
   There were almost no signs of a break-in, the sophisticated
burglar alarm did not function, and none of the five guard dogs
raised a fuss.
   Three current and former employees at the villa, including
<PERSON>Jaguin</PERSON>'s girlfriend, were questioned <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> and released.

<HEAD>Two Years Later, `Irises' is Wilted</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK HAMPSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The sale of <PERSON>Vincent van Gogh</PERSON>'s ``Irises'' for a
record <MONEY>$53.9 million</MONEY> two years ago was considered a loud vote of
confidence in an art market still under the cloud of Wall Street's
Black <DATE>Monday</DATE>.
   But <DATE>two years later</DATE> the world's most expensive painting is
sitting in a vault, and the ``Irises'' deal is looking wilted.
   It turns out that <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby</ORGANIZATION>'s lent Australian tycoon Alan Bond <MONEY>$27
million</MONEY> to buy the <DATE>1889</DATE> painting; that as collateral Bond posted
the picture he was going to buy; that Bond has not paid off the
loan; that <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby</ORGANIZATION>'s, not Bond, now has the painting; that Bond,
reportedly <MONEY>$5 billion</MONEY> in debt, apparently wants to sell the
painting, or at least his share of it.
   And <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby</ORGANIZATION>'s said <DATE>Thursday</DATE> it was abandoning the loan policy
that produced the whole fiasco and, critics complained, inflated
art prices in general.
   In an interview, <PERSON>Michael Ainslie</PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby</ORGANIZATION>'s, said buyers
will no longer be allowed to use art objects they intend to
purchase to secure loans from the auction house.
   Since a painting is worth what someone is willing to pay for it,
and since what someone is willing to pay often depends on how much
that someone can borrow, auctioneer's loans have the potential to
stoke the art market.
   An auction house could use such loans to increase bidding and
hike prices _ and the value of its own <PERCENT>10 percent</PERCENT> commission. If
the borrower-bidder defaults, notes Time magazine art critic <PERSON>Robert
Hughes</PERSON>, the auctioneer takes back the picture, writes off the loan
and resells the work at its new, possibly inflated, price.
   Since auction houses usually charge several points over the
prime lending rate, some critics have described them as a lender of
last resort. Christie's, <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby</ORGANIZATION>'s rival, does not lend money to
buyers.
   <PERSON>Ainslie</PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby</ORGANIZATION>'s made such loans rarely and carefully, and
that their discontinuation would have no impact on art prices.
   ``It was merely a financial service to our clients,'' he said.
``But our foremost concern is our credibility, so we're making this
change largely to correct the misperception that something was
wrong.''
   <PERSON>Angelo Aponte</PERSON>, the city's <ORGANIZATION>Commissioner of Consumer Affairs</ORGANIZATION>,
agreed: ``I don't think it's going to reduce prices, but <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby</ORGANIZATION>'s
had to do it to protect its own credibility. That's the biggest
thing an auction house has going for it.''
   <PERSON>Ainslie</PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby's</ORGANIZATION> had extended such loans only six times on
objects that sold for more than <MONEY>$1 million</MONEY>.
   But one was ``Irises,'' whose sale, according to art dealer
<PERSON>Richard L. Feigen</PERSON>, ``had a real impact on the art market.''
   ``Assume that Bond could not have bid without Sotheby's
financing,'' he said. ``Where would the bidding have stopped?''
   If it stopped short of <MONEY>$40 million</MONEY>, would anyone have paid <MONEY>$47.9
million</MONEY> for ``Yo Picasso'' last <DATE>May</DATE>? Would <PERSON>Walter Annenberg</PERSON> have
paid <MONEY>$40.7 million</MONEY> for the same artist's ``Au Lapin Agile'' in
<DATE>November</DATE>?
   Ainslie's response: Bond probably would have bought the painting
without the <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby</ORGANIZATION>'s loan. At the time of the sale, he was no
credit risk.
   Ainslie's assessment was supported by <PERSON>Thomas Hoving</PERSON>, former
director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and editor of
Connoisseur magazine, who blamed critics and art dealers for the
controversy.
   Dealers, he said, dislike auction houses for luring away their
business; critics, he said, were trying to make something of
nothing. ``Sotheby's just said, `Let's cut our losses. Who needs
this?''' he said. ``It's a peripheral issue.''
   And what of ``Irises'' _ the painting? Sotheby's took it back
after Bond was forced to extend his loan, but <PERSON>Ainslie</PERSON> wouldn't say
where it is ``because of security considerations.'' It is widely
thought to be in a vault in <LOCATION>Switzerland</LOCATION>.
   And what is ``Irises'' now worth? About what Bond bid for it in
<DATE>1987</DATE>, said <PERSON>Ainslie</PERSON>; <MONEY>$30 million</MONEY> to <MONEY>$40 million</MONEY>, according to
skeptical dealers.
   ``We are having discussions with several parties,'' said <PERSON>Michael
Cross</PERSON>, a Bond associate. ``We have received a great many
approaches, but nothing is conclusive at this stage.''

   Police said a security guard and three other
people were held in custody <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> in connection with the theft of
<MONEY>$17 million</MONEY> of art from the home of <ORGANIZATION>Pablo Picasso</ORGANIZATION>'s granddaughter.
   None was charged and investigators released no names. All are
current or former employees of <PERSON>Marina Picasso</PERSON> and worked at her
French Riviera villa, including the guard who was out shopping for

   The four were interrogated <DATE>Monday</DATE> and will be questioned further
regarding the robbery of 13 works of art worth at least <MONEY>$17 million</MONEY>,
the officers said.
   Investigators identified the works only as seven paintings by
<PERSON>Pablo Picasso</PERSON>, one <PERSON>Brueghel</PERSON>, an <PERSON>Odilon Redon</PERSON>, three lesser-known

surrounding the estate, but no other signs of a break-in.
   The burglar alarm did not go off and none of the five guard dogs
interfered, police said. One guard was on vacation and the other had
gone shopping, leaving the house empty.
   Art experts said the items stolen were too well-known to be sold
on the art market by any serious collector or dealer.

   Chanel suits, conversations in French and
exclamations of ``Darling, how are you!'' are as much a part of the
annual spring art auction blitz as multi-million dollar price tags
and Japanese investors.
   Hundreds of paintings by <ORGANIZATION>Picasso</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Monet</ORGANIZATION>, Warhol, <PERSON>Pollack</PERSON> and
others make the sales at <ORGANIZATION>Christie's</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby</ORGANIZATION>'s auction houses an
art-lover's dream. More than a <MONEY>half-billion dollars</MONEY>' worth of art
will be sold during the 12 days of blockbuster sales that began <DATE>May
2</DATE>.
   On <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, record prices were paid for Impressionist and
modern paintings as bidders set marks for eight artists at a
<ORGANIZATION>Christie</ORGANIZATION>'s auction. A <PERSON>Claude Monet</PERSON> painting sold for <MONEY>$14.2 million</MONEY>.
   A day earlier, <ORGANIZATION>Picasso</ORGANIZATION>'s <DATE>1901</DATE> self-portrait ``Yo Picasso'' sold
for <MONEY>$47.85 million</MONEY> at <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby's</ORGANIZATION>, second only the <MONEY>$53.9 million</MONEY> for
<PERSON>Vincent Van Gogh</PERSON>'s ``Irises'' in <DATE>1987</DATE>.
   As the rich rub elbows over <LOCATION>Degas</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Dali</ORGANIZATION>, they're not just
ferreting out their personal favorites and the best investments.
They're also offering people-watchers a firsthand look at how the
other half lives.
   At a recent <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby</ORGANIZATION>'s auction, comments like ``How are things in
<LOCATION>Berlin</LOCATION>?'' and ``I just got back from <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>'' were almost as common
as pearls and Chanel handbags with leather-and-gold chains.
   A cocktail party at <ORGANIZATION>Christie's</ORGANIZATION>, where clients previewed art over
asparagus-and-salmon hors d'oeuvres, featured lots of ladies in
black off-the-shoulder dresses pecking each other on the cheek. A
crimson velvet tunic here and a red satin fringed shawl there lit
up the sea of black.
   ``If I fall in love with something, I might buy it,'' said <PERSON>Eva
Kollsman</PERSON>, a silver-haired woman in a gold-and-black spangled tunic.
``But I think a lot of people come here to get free food, free
drink and that's about it. They haven't the vaguest intention of
bidding on anything.''
   Among the non-buyers was <PERSON>Sarah Schulte</PERSON>, who got on the party
guest list through a relative.
   ``I was listening to one man who thought a <ORGANIZATION>Renoir</ORGANIZATION> was a steal at
<MONEY>$3 million</MONEY>, and I thought, I'm in the same room with this person,''
she said. ``It's very <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, and I love to do things that are
very <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>.''
   <PERSON>Berenice Berke Hetkin</PERSON>, wearing a dashing black hat and a
red-and-black polka-dotted top, attended the party as a possible
buyer, but added: ``If you run into somebody you know, it's a
plus.''
   Art collector <PERSON>John Dallas</PERSON> disagreed: ``Sometimes you see people
you know and you don't want to talk to them because they might
influence your bidding.''
   Seats at blockbuster auctions are reserved for collectors, but
anyone can get a free ticket to stand by calling in advance.
<PERSON>Michelle Porcella</PERSON>, a painter from <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION>, braved the crowded
public section at <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby</ORGANIZATION>'s on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> because, she said: ``It
gives me inspiration to keep going. I know I'm going to be
successful and it's inspiring to know that people will pay so much
for art.''
   Her friend, <PERSON>Gail Miller</PERSON>, said the auction's art and fashions
give her ideas for her work as a jewelry designer. ``I watch what
people wear from the ladies' room on.''

   The sale of a van Gogh for a record <MONEY>$82.5
million</MONEY> bodes well for tonight's auction of a renowned Renoir
painting, but collectors aren't spending so freely for less
significant works, art experts said.
   Renoir's depiction of an open-air dance hall in <LOCATION>Montmartre</LOCATION>, ``Au
Moulin dela Galette,'' is to be auctioned at <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby's</ORGANIZATION>.
   On <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>, van Gogh's ``Portrait of <PERSON>Dr. Gachet</PERSON>'' was the
highlight of a contemporary art sale at <ORGANIZATION>Christie's</ORGANIZATION>, drawing a
record bid from a Japanese gallery.
   ``When you have a tremendous painting, like the van Gogh or the
Renoir that's coming up <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>, you're going to get
extraordinary prices,'' said <PERSON>Milton Esterow</PERSON>, editor and publisher
of ARTnews.
   Buyers are being selective, however, and only the most highly
prized works inspire frenzied bidding.
   Even with the van Gogh, <ORGANIZATION>Christie</ORGANIZATION>'s entire sale brought a total
of <MONEY>$269.4 million</MONEY>. Although that was only <MONEY>$67,000</MONEY> under the record
for an art auction held by <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby</ORGANIZATION>'s, 24 of the 81 offerings did
not sell and some that did went for significantly less than their
pre-sale estimate.
   ``I think (<DATE>Tuesday</DATE>) night showed that the market is correcting
to a more realistic level,'' <PERSON>Esterow</PERSON> said.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Renoir</ORGANIZATION> is estimated by <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby</ORGANIZATION>'s to sell for <MONEY>$40</MONEY> to <MONEY>$50
million</MONEY>, the same presale estimate as the van Gogh. Its owner is
<PERSON>Betsey Cushing Whitney</PERSON>, the widow of <PERSON>John Hay Whitney</PERSON>, the
financier, publisher, sportsman and former ambassador to <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>.
   The large canvas captures an afternoon crowd of revelers beneath
a lush canopy of acacia trees at an open-air dance hall in
<LOCATION>Montmartre</LOCATION> that was popular in the artist's day.
   ``With the van Gogh taking such an unprecedented leap into <MONEY>$82
million</MONEY> that perhaps the other collectors will have to follow suit
and put their estimates a little bit higher as far as the <LOCATION>Whitney</LOCATION>
picture is concerned,'' said <PERSON>Harry Brooks</PERSON>, director of the
<ORGANIZATION>Wildenstein Gallery</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION>.
   The winning bid for ``Dr. Gachet'' was placed by <PERSON>Hideto
Kobayashi</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Gallery of Kobayashi</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>. The gallery won a
heated bidding contest with an unidentified European buyer,
represented by <PERSON>Charles Allsopp</PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Christie</ORGANIZATION>'s in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>.
   The Japanese play a major role in the impressionist and
post-impressionist art market and accounted for a third of the
activity in the auction room, said <PERSON>Michael J. Findlay</PERSON>, who heads
the impressionist and modern art sales for <ORGANIZATION>Christie's</ORGANIZATION>. Americans
and Europeans represented the other two thirds, he said.
   Five of the 11 most expensive paintings sold at auction have
been bought by Japanese collectors, including <PERSON>Pablo Picasso</PERSON>'s
``Pierrette's Wedding,'' purchased in <DATE>1987</DATE> for <MONEY>$51.3 million</MONEY>, and
van Gogh's ``Sunflowers,'' bought in <DATE>1987</DATE> for <MONEY>$39.9 million</MONEY>.
   The strong Japanese presence is attributed by art experts to the
wealth in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, bolstered the yen's rise against the dollar in
recent years. Also, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> has a tradition since the <DATE>1930s</DATE> of
collecting impressionist art.
   ``Van Gogh was an artist who was unabashedly an admirer of
Japanese art and prints,'' said <PERSON>Findlay</PERSON>. Many of the
impressionists' notions of composition _ like the flattened
perspective _ and color come directly from <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, he said.
   <PERSON>David Nash</PERSON>, senior vice president in charge of fine arts at
<ORGANIZATION>Sotheby</ORGANIZATION>'s in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, said Japanese collectors had made inquiries
about ``Au Moulin de la Galette.''
   ``I have no predictions to make about what will happen to the
Renoir,'' <PERSON>Nash</PERSON> said. ``Obviously, it is encouraging to see that a
major <DATE>19th century</DATE> painting can bring such a high price,'' he said
of the van Gogh.
   Renoir paintings have not fetched the top prices that van Gogh's
works have. The highest price paid for a <ORGANIZATION>Renoir</ORGANIZATION> was <MONEY>$17.7 million</MONEY>
in <DATE>April 1989</DATE> for ``La Promenade''; it was bought by the <ORGANIZATION>J. Paul
Getty Museum</ORGANIZATION>. Until <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>, the highest price ever paid for
a painting at auction was <MONEY>$53.9 million</MONEY> for van Gogh's ``Irises.''
   Esterow noted that substantially more Renoirs have been on the
market and that their quality is less consistent.
   But <PERSON>Findlay</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Christie</ORGANIZATION>'s said ``Au Moulin de la Galette'' was
special.
   ``There hasn't been a Renoir of that quality so we don't know
what the market will say about it,'' he said.

   <PERSON>Vincent van Gogh</PERSON>'s portrait of his innkeeper's
teen-age daughter, who wrote a vivid account of the artist's death
decades after his suicide, was set to be auctioned <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> and
was expected to bring more than <MONEY>$15 million</MONEY>.
   ``Portrait of <PERSON>Adeline Ravoux</PERSON>,'' one of van Gogh's last
paintings, is included in a slate of impressionist and modern
paintings scheduled for sale at <ORGANIZATION>Christie</ORGANIZATION>'s auction house.
   The picture of the 13-year-old girl was made a month before van
Gogh committed suicide in <DATE>July 1890</DATE> in the village of <LOCATION>Auvers</LOCATION>
outside <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>. In an essay written when she in her 70s, <PERSON>Adeline
Ravoux Carrie</PERSON> described the artist's final hours as he lay in his
room at her father's inn, dying of a gunshot wound.
   Interest in the painting is keen, experts say, in part because
it serves as a link to the artist's last days. Christie's, the
auction house where the sale will take place, estimates the work
may fetch more than <MONEY>$15 million</MONEY>.
   The portrait last changed hands in <DATE>1980</DATE> when an anonymous buyer
purchased it at a <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby</ORGANIZATION>'s auction for <MONEY>$1.98 million</MONEY>.
   Over the past 14 months, three of paintings by van Gogh _ who
sold almost nothing during his lifetime _ have fetched previously
unheard-of multimillion-dollar prices that shocked the art world.
   In <DATE>March 1987</DATE>, van Gogh's ``Sunflowers'' sold for <MONEY>$39.9 million</MONEY>
at <ORGANIZATION>Christie</ORGANIZATION>'s in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> to a Japanese insurance company. Three
months later, ``The Trinquetaille Bridge'' went for <MONEY>$20.2 million</MONEY>,
also at <ORGANIZATION>Christie</ORGANIZATION>'s in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>. It was bought by an unidentified
collector in <LOCATION>Switzerland</LOCATION>.
   Then, in <DATE>November</DATE>, history was made when van Gogh's ``Irises,''
a composition of purple flowers and green leaves set off by a
single white iris, sold at <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby</ORGANIZATION>'s in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> for <MONEY>$53.9 million</MONEY>
to an anonymous buyer, the highest price paid at auction for a
painting.
   In the painting auctioned <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, <PERSON>Adeline</PERSON>, dressed in blue,
sits in profile on a chair. Her blond hair is tied with a blue
ribbon, her gaze is serene, her posture correct and her hands are
folded demurely in front of her. ``He observed her very deeply, and
when he came to paint her, he painted both the grace and stiff
awkwardness of an adolescent girl,'' said <PERSON>Michael Findlay</PERSON>, senior
vice president of <ORGANIZATION>Christie's</ORGANIZATION> and an expert on impressionist and
modern painting.
   But <PERSON>Mrs. Carrie</PERSON>, who died in <DATE>1965</DATE> at the age of 88, said in a
<DATE>1956</DATE> essay that she didn't immediately appreciate the painting.
   ``I admit that I was only moderately satisfied with my portrait;
it was somewhat of a disappointment, for I did not find it was true
to life,'' <PERSON>Mrs. Carrie</PERSON> wrote.
   However, she was quoted in a <DATE>1953</DATE> interview as saying,
``<PERSON>Monsieur Vincent</PERSON> divined not the young girl I was, but the woman
I was to become.''
   <PERSON>Mrs. Carrie</PERSON> described van Gogh, who lived at her father's inn
during the last 2{ months of his life, as a disciplined artist and
``a soft and calm'' man who enjoyed playing with her baby sister.
   She described how a doctor and police were summoned after he
returned to the inn after shooting himself, and how his brother,
Theo, who was the artist's chief backer, came running from the
train station, his face ``distorted by grief.''
   Among the other artworks set to be auctioned <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> are
works by <PERSON>Pierre Auguste Renoir</PERSON>, <PERSON>Mary Cassatt</PERSON>, <PERSON>Henri de
Toulouse-Lautrec</PERSON>, <PERSON>Pablo Picasso</PERSON> and <PERSON>Georges Braque</PERSON>.

   Thirteen works of art worth about <MONEY>$17
million</MONEY> were stolen from the <LOCATION>Riviera</LOCATION> home of <PERSON>Pablo Picasso</PERSON>'s
granddaughter in what police called one of the biggest art thefts
ever.
   Police declined to reveal the titles of the works, which were
stolen <DATE>Sunday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME> from <ORGANIZATION>Marina Picasso</ORGANIZATION>'s villa in <LOCATION>Cannes</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Ms. Picasso</PERSON> was on vacation in <LOCATION>Megeve</LOCATION> at the time of the
break-in, which police said took place while a guard was out
shopping.
   Police estimated the value of the stolen artwork at <MONEY>$17 million</MONEY>,
and said it included two paintings by <PERSON>Henri Matisse</PERSON>, a bust by
<PERSON>Auguste Rodin</PERSON> and seven paintings by <ORGANIZATION>Picasso</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>Maurice Rheims</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Picasso</ORGANIZATION> expert who was appointed by the
government to help divide up the multibillion-dollar Picasso estate
after the painter's death in <DATE>1973</DATE>, knew the collection and said he
thought the value estimate was low.
   ``I don't know what the thieves will do with the paintings,''
<PERSON>Rheims</PERSON> said. ``They all have been inventoried, catalogued and
photographed many times over. No serious art dealer or collector
would touch them.''
   An official at the <ORGANIZATION>Picasso Museum</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> said the collection
was shown in <DATE>1980</DATE> in <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> and described it as
``impressive.''
   ``If anyone tries to sell them, they're crazy,'' the official
said, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``They would all be
known.''
   <PERSON>Ms. Picasso</PERSON>, who inherited the works from her grandfather,
returned to <LOCATION>Cannes</LOCATION> on <DATE>Monday</DATE> but declined to speak to reporters who
had gathered at the three-story villa.
   Police said they believed a single thief who was familiar with
the house entered it without using force. Investigators said a
sophisticated burglar alarm did not function and none of the five
guard dogs was disturbed.
   <PERSON>Ms. Picasso</PERSON> is the daughter of <PERSON>Paul Picasso</PERSON> and his first wife,
Emilienne. <PERSON>Paul</PERSON>, who was estranged from his father at the time of
his death, was <ORGANIZATION>Picasso</ORGANIZATION>'s only child by his first wife, the
Russian-born dancer <PERSON>Olga Kokhlova</PERSON>.

<HEAD>Picasso Drawing Brings $1.5 Million</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GRAHAM HEATHCOTE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A drawing by <PERSON>Pablo Picasso</PERSON> sold in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>
for <MONEY>$1.58 million</MONEY>, which <ORGANIZATION>Christie</ORGANIZATION>'s said they believed was a record
for any drawing by the Spanish-born artist.
   <PERSON>William Hanham</PERSON>, spokesman for the auction house, said it went to
a private buyer who wants to be anonymous.
   The sale came two days after another Picasso work, ``Acrobat and
<PERSON>Young Harlequin</PERSON>,'' in opaque watercolor called gouache, was bought
at <ORGANIZATION>Christie</ORGANIZATION>'s by <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Mitsukoshi</ORGANIZATION> department store for <MONEY>$38.46
million</MONEY>, the highest price paid at auction for a <DATE>20th century</DATE> work
of art.
   The three-day sale of Impressionist and modern art made a total
of nearly <MONEY>$126 million</MONEY>, <ORGANIZATION>Christie</ORGANIZATION>'s said.
   The Picasso drawing in crayon and pencil depicts a fluted
wineglass, three peaches, playing cards, a cigarette pack and table
napkins.
   Titled ``Still-life with Peaches and Playing Cards,'' it was done
in <LOCATION>Avignon</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, in <DATE>1914</DATE> when <PERSON>Picasso</PERSON> was experimenting with
Cubism in more natural forms.
   The picture was included in a sale of drawings, sculpture, prints
and posters from the collection of the late <PERSON>Douglas Cooper</PERSON>, a
British friend of <ORGANIZATION>Picasso</ORGANIZATION> and a prolific writer on modern art. The
auction brought <MONEY>$5.68 million</MONEY>, more than three times the presale
estimate.
   ``All the 127 lots were sold and it's been a long time since that
happened,'' <PERSON>Hanham</PERSON> added.
   A brown felt-tip pen drawing by the Russian-born artist <PERSON>Nicolas
de Stael</PERSON> of a vase of flowers, which was little more than a doodle,
was bought by an unidentified telephone bidder for <MONEY>$32,400</MONEY>. Its top
presale estimate was <MONEY>$1,110</MONEY>.
   Other artists represented in the sale included <PERSON>Georges Braque</PERSON>,
<PERSON>Juan Gris</PERSON>, <PERSON>Paul Klee</PERSON>, <PERSON>Fernand Leger</PERSON> and <PERSON>Alberto Giacometti</PERSON>.
   Earlier <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> art dealer <PERSON>Fred Mulder</PERSON> paid <MONEY>$549,450</MONEY> at
<ORGANIZATION>Christie</ORGANIZATION>'s for an <DATE>1895</DATE> lithograph of one of the most famous images
in modern art, ``The Shriek,'' by the <ORGANIZATION>Norwegian Edvard Munch</ORGANIZATION> and
hand-colored by him.
   The picture, sold anonymously, shows a woman screaming on a
bridge. Its evocation of anguish has become a symbol of the dying
<DATE>19th century</DATE> moving toward the new torments of the 20th.
   <PERSON>David Llewellyn</PERSON>, director of the auction firm's print department,
said the price made the work a record for a Munch print and one of
the most expensive prints ever sold.
   In an extraordinary week for <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> art sales, <ORGANIZATION>Christie</ORGANIZATION>'s rival
Sotheby's on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> sold a collection of 26 small abstract and
human figure bronzes by British sculptor <PERSON>Henry Moore</PERSON> for <MONEY>$1.95
million</MONEY>.
   The collection, sold separately, belonged to <PERSON>Bo Boustedt</PERSON>, a
Swedish architect and photographer.

<TEXT>
   The <ORGANIZATION>Museum of Modern</ORGANIZATION> Art agreed to sell two
Picassos, a <ORGANIZATION>Monet</ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION>Renoir</ORGANIZATION> and three other paintings from its
permanent collection to get <PERSON>Vincent van Gogh</PERSON>'s portrait of the

   The portrait, painted in 1888-89, arrived at the museum from a

brought it here have been made public.
   For much of this century, the painting was in the <PERSON>B. Mayer</PERSON>
collection in <LOCATION>Zurich</LOCATION>. It was bought in <DATE>1987</DATE> by the most recent
owners and placed in the bank vault.
   <PERSON>Christopher Burge</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Christie</ORGANIZATION>'s in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>,
estimated recently that ``Roulin'' would be worth roughly the same
at auction as van Gogh's ``Irises,'' which brought <MONEY>$53.9 million</MONEY> in
<DATE>1987</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Kirk Varnedoe</PERSON>, director of painting and sculpture at the Modern,
told the Times the museum got ``Roulin'' for substantially less
than that because the unidentified owners wanted it to hang in a
museum. Still, he said, the price was ``not a raging fire-sale
bargain.''
   At first, <PERSON>Varnedoe</PERSON> said, museum officials didn't think they
could afford the van Gogh. But ``because of changes in the art
market, pictures we had available were worth more than we had
thought they were worth, and so it now seemed possible.''
   In <DATE>August</DATE>, the museum, in exchange for ``Roulin,'' gave four
paintings and an undisclosed amount of cash to Swiss dealers <PERSON>Thomas
Ammann</PERSON> and <PERSON>Ernst Beyeler</PERSON>, who represented the owners.
   The dealers received a <ORGANIZATION>Monet</ORGANIZATION> titled ``Corona (Water Lilies),''
from around <DATE>1920</DATE>; <ORGANIZATION>Renoir</ORGANIZATION>'s ``Reclining Nude,'' <DATE>1902</DATE>; <PERSON>Wassily
Kandinsky</PERSON>'s ``Autumn Landscape, <PERSON>Murnau</PERSON>,'' <DATE>1908</DATE>; and <PERSON>Picasso</PERSON>'s
``Striped Bodice,'' <DATE>September 1943</DATE>.
   To reimburse the Modern for the cash it paid _ and, <PERSON>Varnedoe</PERSON>
hopes, provide some extra profits, as well _ three other paintings
will be sold at auction on <DATE>Nov. 15</DATE> at <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby</ORGANIZATION>'s in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>.
   They are <PERSON>Giorgio de Chirico</PERSON>'s ``Evangelical Still Life,'' <DATE>1916</DATE>,
which has a presale estimate of <MONEY>$2 million</MONEY> to <MONEY>$3 million</MONEY>; <PERSON>Piet
Mondrian</PERSON>'s ``Blue Facade (Composition 9),'' 1913-14, estimated at
<MONEY>$3 million</MONEY> to <MONEY>$4 million</MONEY>; and <ORGANIZATION>Picasso</ORGANIZATION>'s ``Studio in a Painted
Frame,'' <DATE>April 1956</DATE>, estimated at <MONEY>$2 million</MONEY> to <MONEY>$3 million</MONEY>.
   The donors of the works granted permission to sell them.
   <PERSON>Varnedoe</PERSON> said the paintings that were relinquished had mostly
languished in storage for years and were not considered crucial
representations of the collection. Even so, he said, the van Gogh
merited a considerable sacrifice.
   ``We feel van Gogh's portraits are the starting point for a
whole vein of 20th-century art,'' said <PERSON>Varnedoe</PERSON>. ``They had
influence on <ORGANIZATION>Matisse</ORGANIZATION> and many others, the whole concept of
revealing a personality not by appearance but color had a profound
influence, and we were not telling this part of the story of modern
art without the portrait. It was a missing chapter.''
