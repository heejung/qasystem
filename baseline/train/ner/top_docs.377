On its convoluted journey to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> spacecraft swung by <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> on 
<DATE>Saturday</DATE>, giving scientists the first glimpse of what it might be like to be 
aboard an alien spacecraft flying through the solar system. 
</P>
<P>
At <TIME>12:35 p.m.</TIME>, only four-tenths of a second behind schedule and a mere five 
miles off course, the <MONEY>$1.5-billion</MONEY> nuclear-powered spacecraft flew flawlessly 
less than 600 miles above the <LOCATION>Atlantic Ocean</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"It was virtually perfect," said <PERSON>William J. O'Neil</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s project manager 
at the <ORGANIZATION>Jet Propulsion Laboratory</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Pasadena</LOCATION>. "We could have missed by 100 
miles or more . . . and we'd still be on our way to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to communicate the elation one feels with these encounters," said 
<PERSON>Clayne M. Yeates</PERSON>, science and mission design manager at <ORGANIZATION>JPL</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
<DATE>Saturday</DATE>'s encounter with Earth was like no previous space mission because it 
allowed scientists for the first time to observe the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and moon in the same 
way and with the same instruments that are used to study other planets in the 
solar system. Eventually, scientists hope to be able to make observations and 
detailed comparisons among planets never before possible in space science. 
</P>
<P>
Two extremely sharp photographs taken <DATE>Saturday</DATE> by <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>, one of the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and 
the other of the moon, gave researchers a hint of the wealth of information 
they can expect when they sift through all the data recorded by the probe 
during the flyby. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever comes of these recorded images, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will surely go down in history 
as "the first time any spacecraft has returned to fly by the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> after 
visiting another planet," <PERSON>O'Neil</PERSON> said. "It's the first confirmed interplanetary 
visitor to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>." 
</P>
<P>
It will be a week before the spacecraft completes its photographs and 
atmospheric measurements of the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and years before all the analyses are 
complete. Yeates jokingly said that at least one <ORGANIZATION>JPL</ORGANIZATION> scientist already has 
"observed intelligence on Earth" from the pictures he has seen. 
</P>
<P>
Although clearly giddy with enthusiasm at how well the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> encounter went, 
scientists at <ORGANIZATION>JPL</ORGANIZATION> realize that they have many more hurdles to cross before the 
six-year mission to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> can be labeled a success. 
</P>
<P>
The next major step will take place <DATE>Oct. 29</DATE>, when <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> passes by the 
asteroid Gaspra, where it will take pictures and make measurements. A year 
later, on <DATE>Dec. 8, 1992</DATE>, it will have its second encounter with <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, sweeping 
the skies just 200 miles above <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Both swings around the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, as well as a rendezvous with <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> last <DATE>February</DATE>, 
were designed so the spacecraft can build enough speed to make the long trip to 
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
In a complicated maneuver known as "gravity assist," the spacecraft makes use 
of the gravity of planets to alter its orbit around the sun and build up speed 
along the way. 
</P>
<P>
As <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> raced by <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, its speed climbed from 67,240 m.p.h. to 78,860 
m.p.h. in its orbit around the sun. When <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> scoots by <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> two years from 
now, its velocity will be boosted 8,280 m.p.h. to a fiery 87,190 m.p.h. -- fast 
enough to begin the long voyage to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, about 480 million miles from the 
sun. 
</P>
<P>
When <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> arrives at <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> late in <DATE>1995</DATE>, it will have journeyed 2.5 
billion miles and begin the first long-term study of the solar system's largest 
planet. As it enters the vicinity of that planet in the <DATE>summer</DATE> of that year, 
the spacecraft will drop a probe into <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s stormy atmosphere before going 
into orbit for a 20-month tour. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> was named for the 17th-Century Italian scientist who discovered 
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s four major moons with one of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s first telescopes.

   Seven months into its six-year, <MONEY>$1.35
billion</MONEY> journey to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> spacecraft ignited its
rocket thrusters repeatedly so it can swoop near <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> in <DATE>December</DATE>,
<ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> said.
   The tiny rocket thrusters were ordered to fire during a two-day
maneuver that ends late today, said <PERSON>Jim Wilson</PERSON>, a spokesman at the
<ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
   ``We are changing both the speed and the aim point for our Earth
flyby. It's a very gradual change,'' mission director <PERSON>Neal Ausman</PERSON>
said <DATE>Friday</DATE>.
   On <DATE>Dec. 8</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will swoop past Earth in a gravity slingshot
maneuver designed to help expand the spacecraft's orbit around the
sun and hurl it toward its <DATE>1995</DATE> rendezvous with <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, the solar
system's largest planet.
   The spacecraft will study <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> during the flyby and again
during another slingshot maneuver in <DATE>December 1992</DATE>. <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> used
<PERSON>Venus</PERSON> as a gravity slingshot <DATE>Feb. 9</DATE>.
   When the maneuver started at <TIME>11:10 a.m. PDT</TIME> <DATE>Friday</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> was
96 million miles from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, but had traveled a looping path of 365
million miles since it was launched from space shuttle Atlantis
last <DATE>Oct. 18</DATE>, <PERSON>Wilson</PERSON> said.
   Its trip to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, the fifth planet from the sun, will total
2.4 billion miles.
   The <MONEY>$1.35 billion</MONEY> mission will take <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> past one asteroid in
<DATE>1991</DATE> and perhaps another in <DATE>1993</DATE>. In <DATE>July 1995</DATE>, the spacecraft
separates into a 4,890-pound orbiter and a 760-pound probe. They
are scheduled to reach <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Dec. 7, 1995</DATE>.
   The probe will plunge into the planet's atmosphere, relaying
measurements to the orbiter until it is destroyed by intense
atmospheric pressure. The orbiter will spend at least two years
studying and taking snapshots of <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> and its major moons Io,
<LOCATION>Europa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ganymede</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Callisto</ORGANIZATION>.
   One or two more trajectory maneuvers are needed to get <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>
to swoop about 1,000 miles from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> in <DATE>December</DATE>, <PERSON>Ausman</PERSON> said.
Without the maneuvers, the spacecraft would miss Earth by 1.5
million miles.

   The spacecraft <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> grabbed <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s
gravity coattails <DATE>Saturday</DATE> and arced around the planet on a
fleeting visit home 13{ months into a six-year voyage to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>.
   Taking pictures and exploring with instruments, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> used
Earth as a gravity slingshot, hurtling 597 miles above the western
<LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION>, the point of closest approach.
   The encounter, at <TIME>12:35 p.m. PST</TIME>, increased the craft's speed by
11,600 mph, giving it a speed of 79,000 mph relative to the sun.
Relative to the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, which is also moving, the maximum speed was
30,721 mph.
   ``Everything is working exactly as it should,'' said mission
director <PERSON>Neal E. Ausman Jr.</PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory as
the craft flew through <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s shadow. ``We've had no glitches, no
problems.''
   Project officials said the flyby was a valuable dress rehearsal
for the <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> encounter.
   ``Every time we turn an instrument on, we have problems
understanding what we've done to it, and what we probably can do to
the software,'' said <PERSON>Clayne M. Yeates</PERSON>, science and mission design
manager. ``So we're really learning how to operate these
instruments. It's been invaluable for us to collect this data.''
   Project manager <PERSON>William J. O'Neil</PERSON> added, ``Once we do figure out
what they're doing we find that they're operating up to expectation
or beyond.''
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s looping 2.4 billion-mile route to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> made it the
first planetary spacecraft to approach Earth from space and
provided scientists the first opportunity to look at the world in
the same way as they have other planets.
   Controllers ordered <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s instruments to measure gases that
cause ``greenhouse effect'' warming of the atmosphere and study
high-altitude water vapor involved in creating and destroying the
ozone layer.
   The trajectory also allowed scientists to explore the far side
of the moon, always facing away from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, with modern instruments
for the first time. The far side observations will occur over
several days.
   Galileo approached from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s dark side, measuring its
magnetic field and solar plasma flows, and taking pictures of the
crescent moon.
   Two pictures released soon after the flyby showed a portion of
the near-side of the moon and a cloud-streaked view of central
<LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>. Data and pictures will continue to come in as <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>
speeds away.
   Its path also took it 2,162 miles above the orbiting space
shuttle <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION>.
   Exploration of the blue planet and its moon was an added bonus
to <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s <MONEY>$1.4 billion</MONEY> mission.
   The spacecraft was originally designed to make a 2{-year direct
flight to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> for long-term observation of the solar system's
biggest planet.
   But the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION>'s safety
review after the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger in <DATE>1986</DATE>
led to changes in <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s own booster system that made a direct
flight impossible because its new rocket was less powerful.
   Shuttle Atlantis carried <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> into orbit <DATE>Oct. 18, 1989</DATE>, and
launched it on a roundabout trajectory using three gravity assists
from <LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   The spacecraft flew past <LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION> on <DATE>Feb. 10</DATE>. It will get another
boost from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> on <DATE>Dec. 8, 1992</DATE>. That encounter will be closer, at
an altitude of about 200 miles. The pass will also greatly widen
its orbit around the sun in order to intercept <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will go into orbit around <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Dec. 7, 1995</DATE>.
   A probe launched from <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> five months earlier will plunge
into the atmosphere at 100,000 mph, deploy a parachute and make
measurements for 75 minutes until it is crushed by intense
pressure.
   The orbiter will continue to explore <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> and 10 of its 16
known moons for two years.

   The <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> spacecraft, racing toward a
close encounter with <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> next week so it can reach <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in
<DATE>1995</DATE>, will explore its home planet like an alien world, scientists
said <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   The camera-bearing planetary spacecraft will be the first to
approach Earth from space, so the <DATE>Dec. 8</DATE> flyby will be ``our first
chance to look at <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> as we have at other planets in the solar
system,'' <PERSON>Torrence Johnson</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s chief scientist, said during
a news conference.
   ``It gives humankind a vantage point to look at their world as
they've never seen it before,'' <PERSON>Bill O'Neil</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> project
manager at <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Jet Propulsion Laboratory</ORGANIZATION>, said earlier.
   Galileo is the most sophisticated planetary spacecraft ever
built. It was launched from space shuttle Atlantis on <DATE>Oct. 18,
1989</DATE>, starting its <MONEY>$1.4 billion</MONEY>, 2.4 billion-mile journey to
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, the solar system's largest planet.
   Starting in <DATE>December 1995</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> orbiter will spend two
years exploring <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> and 10 of its moons after deploying a probe
that will make measurements in <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s atmosphere until it is
crushed by intense pressure there.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s route was designed so the unmanned spacecraft could
use Venus and <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> as ``gravity slingshots'' to expand its orbit
around the sun and reach <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>. It will use Earth for that
purpose <DATE>Dec. 8</DATE> and again in <DATE>December 1992</DATE>. It used <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> as a
gravity slingshot last <DATE>February</DATE>.
   Scientists decided to take advantage of the close encounters to
make pictures and measurements of Venus and <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. Data collected
at <LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION> was stored on <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s tape recorder and sent to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>
<DATE>last week</DATE>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s optical camera made detailed pictures of the uppermost
layer of <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' sulfuric acid clouds, as did spacecraft that
visited Venus previously. But <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s infrared camera made the
first still pictures and a movie showing clouds moving in 150 mph
winds in <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' middle and lower cloud decks.
   Severe turbulence that may be caused by thunderstorms was
detected in the middle cloud layer, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> scientist <PERSON>Robert Carlson</PERSON>
said.
   Studying <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' acid clouds and its carbon dioxide atmosphere
may help scientists understand how increasing carbon dioxide levels
in <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s atmosphere will warm the planet like glass traps heat in
a greenhouse, said <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION> astronomer <PERSON>Michael Belton</PERSON>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> also discovered remarkably fast high-energy particles
flowing away from <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>, a surprise because space around the planet
was thought to be placid, said <ORGANIZATION>University of Iowa</ORGANIZATION> physicist <ORGANIZATION>Louis
Frank</ORGANIZATION>.
   The spacecraft also recorded scratchy and screechy sounds
created by waves in electrically charged solar wind particles that
sweep around <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>. Scientists played the tape <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will swoop about 593 miles above the southwest <LOCATION>Atlantic
Ocean</LOCATION> at <TIME>3:35 p.m. EST</TIME> <DATE>Dec. 8</DATE>. <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> was 4.46 million miles from
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> on <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   The spacecraft will measure gases that cause ``greenhouse
effect'' warming of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s atmosphere, and study high-altitude
water vapor that helps create and destroy <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s protective ozone
layer, <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> said.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> also will be the first spacecraft with modern
instruments to study the far side of the moon, which is always
pointed away from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, he added.

   The <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> spacecraft, looping through
the solar system on the way to its <DATE>1995</DATE> exploration of <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>,
fired its thrusters today in a major maneuver meant to steer it
near <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> late this year.
   ``We're trying to reshape the trajectory slightly so we move
closer and closer to our aim point near <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> on <DATE>Dec. 8</DATE>,'' said
<PERSON>Neal Ausman</PERSON>, mission director at <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Jet Propulsion Laboratory</ORGANIZATION>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s tiny rocket thrusters, which are small enough to fit
in the palm of a hand, started firing at <TIME>11:10 a.m. PDT</TIME> and will
fire roughly 3,000 times by the time the maneuver ends <DATE>Saturday</DATE>
<TIME>afternoon</TIME>, laboratory spokesman <PERSON>Jim Wilson</PERSON> said.
   The two-day maneuver will slow the spacecraft, which was
traveling about 66,000 mph earlier today, by about 25 mph. It also
will gradually alter its direction, <PERSON>Ausman</PERSON> said.
   It is the second of three or four maneuvers needed to bring
<ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> within 1,000 miles of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, which will act as a gravity
slingshot to help expand the spacecraft's orbit around the sun and
propel it toward <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, he added. Without maneuvers, the
spacecraft would miss Earth by 1.5 million miles.
   As of today, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> was 96 million miles from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, but has
traveled a looping path of 365 million miles since it was launched
from space shuttle Atlantis last <DATE>Oct. 18</DATE>. Its trip to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> will
total 2.4 billion miles.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will make a second swing past <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> in <DATE>December 1992</DATE>. It
flew past <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> in another gravity slingshot maneuver on <DATE>Feb. 9</DATE>.
   In <DATE>July 1995</DATE>, the spacecraft separates into a 4,890-pound
orbiter and a 760-pound probe. They are scheduled to reach <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>,
the solar system's largest planet, on <DATE>Dec. 7, 1995</DATE>.
   The probe will plunge into the planet's atmosphere, relaying
measurements to the orbiter before the probe is destroyed by
intense atmospheric pressure. The orbiter will spend at least two
years studying and taking snapshots of <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> and its major moons
Europa, <LOCATION>Ganymede</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Callisto</ORGANIZATION>.

   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> engineers were unwilling to wait
until <DATE>October</DATE> to see the <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> spacecraft's photographs of Venus,
so they used an experimental method to get three of the pictures
sent to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> early.
   One of the photos released <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> shows clouds as small as 25
miles wide as well as clouds rising from lower in the atmosphere.
It was taken <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> when the Jupiter-bound <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> was about
1 million miles past <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>, the second planet from the sun.
   ``You can see clouds, and you can see some very interesting
detail in the cloud patterns,'' said <PERSON>Neal Ausman</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> mission
director at the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet
Propulsion Laboratory. ``The engineers and scientists are
exceptionally pleased.''
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> is scheduled to go into orbit around <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>December
1995</DATE> in a <MONEY>$1.35 billion</MONEY> mission to study the solar system's largest
planet. Just before <TIME>10 p.m. PST</TIME> <DATE>last Friday</DATE>, the spacecraft swooped
about 10,025 miles over <LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION> so that planet could act as a gravity
slingshot to help hurl the spacecraft on its way to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>.
   Most of the photographs and other data collected during and
after the flyby won't be sent back until <DATE>October</DATE>, when the
spacecraft is closer to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s main antenna now is furled
to protect it from the heat of the sun. A smaller antenna, which
can transmit and receive information only at a very slow rate, is
being used almost exclusively to operate the spacecraft.
   But <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> engineers were able to get <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> to send the three
photos back to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> on <DATE>Monday</DATE> and <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> by transferring separate
batches of the computer data that make up each image for radio
transmission, <PERSON>Ausman</PERSON> said.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>Jim Wilson</PERSON> called the technique ``experimental
and difficult.''
   <PERSON>Ausman</PERSON> said engineers also were able to get the spacecraft to
send back some infrared light measurements designed to study <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>'
lower atmosphere, as well as ultraviolet light measurements and
data from sensors designed to detect dust and magnetic fields in
space around <LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION>.
   By the time <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s fly-by of Venus formally ends <DATE>Friday</DATE>
<TIME>night</TIME>, the spacecraft's television camera will have taken about 80
pictures of cloud-shrouded <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>.
   Many other spacecraft have photographed <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>, some from much
closer than <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>. But the new photos still should have
scientific value, <PERSON>Ausman</PERSON> said.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> was deployed from the space shuttle Atlantis last <DATE>Oct.
18</DATE> on a looping 2.4 billion, six-year route that requires <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> and
Earth to be used as gravity slingshots to hurl the spacecraft to
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>. It will fly past <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> on <DATE>Dec. 8</DATE>, then again on <DATE>Dec. 8,
1992</DATE>.
   Meanwhile, in the outer reaches of the solar system, the Voyager
1 spacecraft sent radio signals indicating it had successfully
snapped photographs to make up the first group portrait of the
solar system, according to <ORGANIZATION>JPL</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON>Mary Hardin</PERSON>.
   Voyager 1, which photographed <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1980</DATE> and <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> in
<DATE>1981</DATE>, was ordered to shoot the pictures <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> <TIME>evening</TIME>. But it
took five hours and 36 minutes for confirmation of the photographs
to travel the 3.7 billion miles to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Hardin</PERSON> said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.

   The <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> spaceship swooped past Venus
early <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, and the cloud-shrouded planet acted as a gravity
slingshot to help hurl the craft toward its <DATE>1995</DATE> rendezvous with
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>.
   Engineers at <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory received a radio
signal confirming that the 2.8-ton spacecraft made its closest
approach to Venus at <TIME>12:59 a.m. EST</TIME>, cruising 10,028 miles above
the planet's hellishly hot surface.
   ``We have just flown through our closest approach point to
Venus,'' said <PERSON>Bill O'Neil</PERSON>, science and mission design manager.
``The greatest challenge of getting <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> has been
met.''
   Four hours before the close encounter, radio signals received on
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> confirmed the spacecraft computer ordered <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s infrared
light sensor to start observing <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>. The instrument was looking
for the glow of the hot lower atmosphere backlighting cooler clouds
overhead, <PERSON>O'Neil</PERSON> said.
   That started an eight-hour period of intensive photography and
measurements, including a photographic search for lightning.
Earlier <DATE>Friday</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> studied dust particles and magnetic fields
in space, and measured Venusian atmospheric temperatures.
   ``The Venus encounter is our first major milestone in the
mission,'' said <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> project scientist <PERSON>Torrence Johnson</PERSON>. ``After
the encounter, we have gained enough energy out of this celestial
billiard shot to get the energy we need to make it all the way to
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>.''
   The power the spacecraft gains in the flyby is triple the energy
of its propellant supply, said mission director <PERSON>Neal Ausman</PERSON>.
   The <MONEY>$1.35 billion</MONEY> mission will let <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> examine <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, its
moon and one or two asteroids before the spacecraft separates into
an orbiter and a small probe in <DATE>July 1995</DATE>. In <DATE>December 1995</DATE>, they
arrive at <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, the solar system's largest planet, after a
2.4-billion-mile trip, including 182 million miles to reach <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> was deployed from the space shuttle Atlantis last <DATE>Oct.
18</DATE>.
   Venus circles the sun between the orbits of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Mercury</ORGANIZATION>,
the closest planet to the sun. Acid-laden clouds extend 40 miles
above the surface, trapping heat in a runaway ``greenhouse effect''
that raised surface temperatures to 900 degrees Fahrenheit.
Atmospheric pressure is 90 times that on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. Venus is about <PERCENT>95
percent</PERCENT> as wide as <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. Scientists suspect it may have active
volcanoes and shifting plates on its crust.
   The Venus flyby was designed purely to give <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> a boost for
its trip to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> by increasing its speed from 83,750 mph to
88,740 mph. In two other ``gravity assist'' maneuvers, the
spacecraft will use the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> as a slingshot next <DATE>Dec. 8</DATE> and again
on <DATE>Dec. 8, 1992</DATE>, so it will be properly aimed toward <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>,
<PERSON>Ausman</PERSON> said.
   Scientists decided to take advantage of the Venus encounter by
having <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s camera and instruments make photographs and
measurements of Venus starting <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> and continuing for a
week.
   But almost all the pictures and data _ stored on three tracks of
<ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s four-track tape recorder _ won't be sent back to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>
until <DATE>October</DATE>, when the spacecraft is close enough to transmit the
material with its low-gain antenna. That antenna now can be used
only for communications to keep <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> operating.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s main umbrella-shaped antenna must remain furled to
protect it from sunlight until after the craft makes its first
flight past <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> was programmed to photograph <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> and study the planet
with its ultraviolet, infrared and visible light sensors to look
for lightning, study the makeup of the carbon dioxide atmosphere,
examine cloud and wind patterns, map cloudtop temperatures and peer
at the lower atmosphere.
   Sensors that detect particles and magnetic fields were
programmed to study how solar wind interacts with <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>'
atmosphere. At the same time, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> arranged for the <ORGANIZATION>Pioneer Venus
Orbiter</ORGANIZATION>, circling <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> since <DATE>1978</DATE>, to make similar measurements
closer to the planet, <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> said.
   While nearly 20 other <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and Soviet spacecraft have visited
<PERSON>Venus</PERSON>, ``we think we're going to get some real good stuff,'' he
said.
   But scientists won't know for months unless engineers meet
success next week when they try to have <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> send back a small
amount of data, <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> added.
   Studies from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and previous spacecraft indicate <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> has
continent-sized highlands with peaks dwarfing <LOCATION>Mount Everest</LOCATION> and
hundreds of thousands of volcanoes stretching across lowland plains.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> spacecraft, launched from <LOCATION>Atlantis</LOCATION> <DATE>last May 4</DATE>,
will go into orbit around Venus in <DATE>August</DATE>. It will use radar to
peer through the clouds and map at least <PERCENT>70 percent</PERCENT> of <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>'
surface during a <MONEY>$550 million</MONEY> mission.
   When the <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> probe and orbiter reach <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, the probe will
parachute into the atmosphere and make measurements until intense
heat and pressure vaporize it. The orbiter will photograph and
study <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> and its major moons until late <DATE>1997</DATE>, circling the
planet instead of flying past it like the Pioneer and Voyager
spacecraft.
   The <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION> originally
planned to send <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> on a two-year trip to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> by launching
it with a <ORGANIZATION>Centaur</ORGANIZATION> rocket after it was released from a shuttle.
   But the <DATE>1986</DATE> explosion that destroyed Challenger and killed
seven crew members raised safety concerns. <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> decided against
using the volatile, liquid-fueled Centaur.
   So <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> was launched with a much weaker <ORGANIZATION>Inertial Upper Stage</ORGANIZATION>
booster after it was deployed by Atlantis' crew. The weaker rocket
required <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> to redesign <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s route so the craft could
utilize gravity from <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> and Earth for a much longer, looping
trip to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>.
   Environmentalists failed in court to stop <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> from having a
shuttle carry <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> into space. They feared a Challenger-like
explosion could contaminate <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> with plutonium in <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s
nuclear batteries, which are not reactors but generate electricity
using heat from the radioactive decay of plutonium. <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> said the
risk was minimal.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> is named for the Italian Renaissance astronomer who
discovered <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s major moons.

   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> spacecraft developed
camera trouble today after zooming around cloud-covered Venus in a
``celestial billiard shot'' that speeded the robot explorer toward
its <DATE>1995</DATE> encounter with <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>.
   Although the glitch threatened to prevent <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> from snapping
five dozen more pictures of Venus tonight and next week, project
scientist <PERSON>Torrence Johnson</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory said
it should cause no permanent problems for the mission.
   Mission director <PERSON>Neal Ausman</PERSON> said the TV camera shutter, after
taking 16 planned pictures of Venus early today, clicked open and
closed 452 times, twice per minute, apparently because of faulty
commands from the probe's main computer.
   Ausman, speaking at a news conference, said the unwanted
computer commands then stopped for reasons not immediately
understood, and a <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> was working to fix the problem.
   The extra exposures weren't recorded, the malfunction won't harm
the 16 pictures that were taken, the camera was undamaged, and
engineers shut off the camera until it can be repaired, project
manager <PERSON>Dick Spehalski</PERSON> said.
   The 2.8-ton spacecraft made its closest approach to Venus at
<TIME>9:59 p.m. PST</TIME> <DATE>Friday</DATE>. It was supposed to pass 10,028 miles above
the furnace-like surface of the second planet from the sun, but
actually came three or four miles closer, said mission science and
design manager <PERSON>Bill O'Neil</PERSON>.
   ``We have clearly achieved the sole objective of going to Venus:
a trajectory that will help us ultimately reach <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>,'' he said.
   As a result, scientists won't be very disappointed if the
malfunction prevents <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> from snapping an additional five dozen
planned pictures of <LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION>, which has been photographed by numerous
other spacecraft, <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> said.
   The 16 pictures taken will be used to study wind and cloud
patterns and search for lightning that might indicate the presence
of volcanoes erupting beneath the clouds.
   The spacecraft's ultraviolet, visible and infrared light sensors
studied the makeup of <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' carbon dioxide atmosphere, mapped
cloud-top temperatures and looked for the glow of the hot lower
atmosphere backlighting cooler clouds overhead, <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> said.
   The pictures and data were stored on <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s tape recorder,
and won't be sent back to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> until <DATE>October</DATE> when the spacecraft
is close enough to transmit the material with its low-gain antenna.
That antenna now can be used only for communications to keep
<ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> operating.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s main umbrella-shaped antenna must remain furled to
protect it from sunlight until after the craft cruises past <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>
on <DATE>Dec. 8</DATE>.
   The <MONEY>$1.35 billion</MONEY> mission also will let <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> examine <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>,
its moon and one or two asteroids before the spacecraft separates
into an orbiter and a small probe in <DATE>July 1995</DATE>. In <DATE>December 1995</DATE>,
they arrive at <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, the solar system's largest planet, after a
2.4-billion-mile trip, including 182 million miles to reach <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> was deployed from space shuttle Atlantis last <DATE>Oct. 18</DATE>.
   Acid-laden clouds extend 40 miles above <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' surface, trapping
heat in a runaway ``greenhouse effect'' that raises surface
temperatures to 900 degrees Fahrenheit. Atmospheric pressure is 90
times that on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Ausman</PERSON> said the photos and measurements of Venus were secondary
to the main purpose of the flyby: using the planet as a ``gravity
slingshot'' to expand the spacecraft's orbit and boost its speed to
88,740 mph from 83,750 mph.
   ``We have gained enough energy out of this celestial billiard
shot to get the energy we need to make it all the say to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>,''
<PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> said.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will use the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> as a gravity slingshot next <DATE>December</DATE>
and again <DATE>Dec. 8, 1992</DATE>, so it will be properly aimed toward
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Ausman</PERSON> said.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> spacecraft, launched from <LOCATION>Atlantis</LOCATION> <DATE>last May 4</DATE>,
will go into orbit around Venus in <DATE>August</DATE>. It will use radar map at
least <PERCENT>70 percent</PERCENT> of <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' surface during a <MONEY>$550 million</MONEY> mission.

parachute into the atmosphere and make measurements until intense
heat and pressure vaporizes it. The orbiter will photograph and
study <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> and its major moons until late <DATE>1997</DATE>, circling the
planet instead of flying past it like the Pioneer and Voyager
spacecraft.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s roundabout route to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> is an indirect result of
the <DATE>1986</DATE> explosion that destroyed the shuttle Challenger and killed
seven crew members. After the tragedy, the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and
Space Administration</ORGANIZATION> decided against using powerful, volatile,
liquid-fueled Centaur rockets to launch spacecraft after they were
deployed from shuttles.
   Instead, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> was launched by a weaker booster after it was
released from Atlantis' cargo bay. That made it necessary to use
the gravity of Venus and Earth to help speed and aim <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> toward
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>. A <ORGANIZATION>Centaur</ORGANIZATION> would have propelled <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> to Venus in only
two years.
   Environmentalists failed in court to block <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s mission.
They feared a Challenger-like explosion could contaminate <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>
with plutonium in <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s nuclear batteries, which generate
electricity using heat from the radioactive decay of plutonium.
<ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> said the risk was minimal.

<HEAD>Galileo Flyby Spurs NASA `Aliens' to Conclude There's Life on

<TEXT>
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> scientists pretending to be
explorers from another world said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> they had concluded life
exists on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, and it may be intelligent.
   The scientists based their conclusinon on data from the
Jupiter-bound <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> spacecraft.
   ``The accumulated evidence we have ... would give your
hypothetical explorer a very strong indication you had biological
activity on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON>Torrence Johnson</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s chief
scientist at the <ORGANIZATION>Jet Propulsion Laboratory</ORGANIZATION>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s study of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> illustrates how researchers use data
collected by spacecraft to reach conclusions about other planets.
   Galileo boomeranged past <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and the moon <DATE>Dec. 8</DATE>, using the
planet's gravity as a slingshot to speed it up and expand its orbit
around the sun so it can reach <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1995</DATE>.
   Scientists used the opportunity to treat Earth as an alien
planet, ordering <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> to snap a few thousand pictures and make
numerous measurements. They outlined their findings during a
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE> news conference.
   Measurements made by <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s infrared light-detecting
instrument showed <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s atmosphere is rich in nitrous oxide,
methane and oxygen, indicating ``there's a lot of life'' on the
planet, said laboratory scientist <PERSON>Robert W. Carlson</PERSON>.
   Another of <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s instruments picked up non-natural radio
signals that got stronger closer to the planet, which would make
alien scientists strongly suspect <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> has intelligent life that
makes radio broadcasts, <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> said.
   The spaceship also detected lightning bolts, made measurements
to help explain creation of the <ORGANIZATION>Northern and Southern Lights</ORGANIZATION>,
determined the planet is warmed by a mild ``greenhouse effect'' and
detected a high-altitude ice cloud that helps cause the annual hole
in the protective ozone layer over <LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION>.
   On the moon, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> found evidence of a huge volcanic eruption
4 billion years ago. That shows such volcanic activity occurred
about 200 million years earlier than previously believed, said
<ORGANIZATION>Brown University</ORGANIZATION> geologist <PERSON>Jim Head</PERSON>.
   The spacecraft's pictures also confirmed the existence of a
1,200-mile-wide meteorite impact basin on the southern hemisphere
of the moon's far side, the largest such crater ever identified,
<PERSON>Head</PERSON> said.
   The <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION> released nine
more of <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s photos of the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and moon <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
   One was a mosaic, assembled from 11 separate pictures, showing
all of icy <LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION>. Others showed huge lunar craters, a color
map of minerals on the moon's surface, clouds swirling over <LOCATION>South
America</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s larger lakes and Great Barrier Reef.
   The pictures didn't display evidence of life on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> because
<ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s closest approach to the planet, at a distance of 597
miles, was over the southwest <LOCATION>Atlantic Ocean</LOCATION>. The detail in the
pictures was inadequate to reveal buildings, scientists said.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> also displayed two short movies, made by assembling
hundreds of <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s still photos, showing the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and moon
spinning.
   ``Top that, <PERSON>Ted Turner</PERSON>!'' Head declared after the colorized
lunar movie was played. He was referring to media mogul <PERSON>Turner</PERSON>'s
controversial practice of colorizing classic films.
   Also <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> fired its thrusters repeatedly to aim
itself properly for its close encounter with the asteroid Gaspra
next <DATE>Oct. 29</DATE>, said project manager <PERSON>Bill O'Neil</PERSON>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will swing past <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> again <DATE>Dec. 8, 1992</DATE>, for a final
``gravity slingshot'' maneuver to help it reach <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>. In <DATE>July
1995</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will separate into an orbiter and a probe. Both will
reach <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>December 1995</DATE>.
   The probe will descend into <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s atmosphere, returning data
to the orbiter until the probe is crushed by intense atmospheric
pressure. The orbiter will circle <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> for at least two years,
studying the planet and making closeup pictures of its 10 largest
moons.

<HEAD>Nationwide Survey Finds Americans Are ``Scientific Illiterates''</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly 500 years after <PERSON>Copernicus</PERSON> postulated that
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> revolves around the sun, millions of Americans think
otherwise, suggests a poll that found vast numbers of the nation's
adults ``scientifically illiterate.''
   Many Americans also mistakenly believe that laser beams are
focused sound waves and that atoms are smaller than electrons, said
<PERSON>Jon Miller</PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION>Public Opinion Laboratory</ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION>Northern
Illinois University</ORGANIZATION>, who conducted a nationwide survey for the
<ORGANIZATION>National Science Foundation</ORGANIZATION>.
   In a <DATE>July</DATE> telephone survey, 2,041 adults 18 or older were asked
about 75 questions on basic science, <PERSON>Miller</PERSON> said. The survey had a
margin of error of plus or minus <PERCENT>3 percentage points</PERCENT>.
   Asked whether the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> goes around the sun or the sun around
the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, <PERCENT>21 percent</PERCENT> replied incorrectly. Seven percent said they
didn't know.
   In the <DATE>early 16th century</DATE>, the Polish astronomer <PERSON>Nicholas
Copernicus</PERSON> laid the foundation for modern astronomy with his
heliocentric theory of planetary motion in which the planets
revolved around a motionless sun.
   Forty-five percent correctly said it takes a year for the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>
to orbit the sun, but <PERCENT>17 percent</PERCENT> said one day, <PERCENT>2 percent</PERCENT> said <DATE>one
month</DATE> and <PERCENT>9 percent</PERCENT> didn't know.
   ``The results show that on very basic ideas, vast numbers of
Americans are scientifically illiterate,'' <PERSON>Miller</PERSON> said <DATE>Sunday</DATE>.
``It's a fairly dire situation.''
   The results of the survey haven't been fully tabulated yet, but
it appears that <PERCENT>93 percent</PERCENT> to <PERCENT>95 percent</PERCENT> would have to be
considered scientifically illiterate, lacking fundamental knowledge
of scientific vocabulary, methodology and an understanding of
science's impact on the world, said <PERSON>Miller</PERSON>. The group's <DATE>1985</DATE> survey
found a <PERCENT>95 percent</PERCENT> illiteracy rate.
   The results indicate many Americans have little idea of what
presidential candidates are talking about when they list key issues
such as the <ORGANIZATION>Strategic Defense Initiative</ORGANIZATION>, acid rain, the greenhouse
effect and the space race, he said.
   <PERSON>Leon Lederman</PERSON>, who last week was named co-winner of the <DATE>1988</DATE>
Nobel Prize for physics and is director of the <ORGANIZATION>Fermi National
Accelerator Laboratory</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Batavia</LOCATION>, called the latest findings
``pretty devastating.''
   ``How you can preserve democracy when the world is increasingly
more complex scientifically and technologically, and people are
increasingly more ignorant of the issues?'' he asked.
   On other questions, the survey found that <PERCENT>43 percent</PERCENT> said
correctly that electrons, which are components of atoms, are
smaller than atoms; <PERCENT>20 percent</PERCENT> thought they were larger and <PERCENT>37
percent</PERCENT> had no idea.
   Asked if lasers _ an essential component of the proposed Star
Wars defense system _ work by focusing sound waves, <PERCENT>36 percent</PERCENT>
correctly answered the statement was false. Twenty-nine percent
thought it was true and <PERCENT>35 percent</PERCENT> didn't know. Lasers work by
focusing light waves. In fact, the name stands for Light
Amplification by <ORGANIZATION>Stimulated Emission of Radiation</ORGANIZATION>.
   Most of those surveyed _ <PERCENT>76 percent</PERCENT> _ answered correctly that
light travels faster than sound. Nineteen percent mistakenly
thought sound moves faster.
   <PERSON>Miller</PERSON> said some of the responses indicate the lack of
scientific knowledge could present some practical problems.
   For example, <PERCENT>63 percent</PERCENT> said incorrectly that antibiotics kill
viruses as well as bacteria.
   So if a doctor tells a patient he has a virus and the patient
has an antibiotic around the house, he's liable to take it, said
<PERSON>Miller</PERSON>. Antibiotics don't kill viruses.
   <PERSON>Miller</PERSON> said the great majority of high school graduates have not
had a day's instruction in algebra, physics or chemistry.
   ``It's important to turn that around,'' he said.

   The far side of the moon, last
photographed by Apollo astronauts two decades ago, was captured on
film again by the <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> spacecraft when it zoomed past the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>
on its long voyage to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``It's staggering to realize we've been neglecting our own
satellite,'' said <PERSON>Torrence Johnson</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s chief scientist at
<ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   Astronauts with the 1969-1972 Apollo lunar missions photographed
the back side of the moon, but <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> said <DATE>Thursday</DATE> the last good
pictures before <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> were made by unmanned lunar orbiters during
the <DATE>1960s</DATE>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> passed the moon after it swooped 597 miles above the
southwest <LOCATION>Atlantic Ocean</LOCATION> on <DATE>Saturday</DATE>. It used <ORGANIZATION>Earth</ORGANIZATION>'s gravity as a
slingshot to help expand the spacecraft's orbit around the sun so
it can reach <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1995</DATE>. It used <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> for the same purpose
last <DATE>February</DATE> and will fly past <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> again in <DATE>December 1992</DATE>.
   The planetary encounters are meant solely to help propel <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>
on its <MONEY>$1.4 billion</MONEY> mission to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>. But scientists took the
opportunity to use the spacecraft to study <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> in dress
rehearsals for exploring <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>.
   Three of <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s new photographs of the moon and <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> were
released <DATE>Thursday</DATE> by the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space
Administration</ORGANIZATION> as <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> zoomed away from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, snapping more
pictures of its home planet from a distance of 2.33 million miles.
   One photo shows the crescent moon, while another shows <PERSON>Mare
Orientale</PERSON>, a 550-mile-wide meteorite impact crater on the far side
of the moon, which is always pointed away from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. Because of
the way the moon orbits <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, only five-eighths of its surface can
be seen from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s third picture shows half of <LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION>, including the
<ORGANIZATION>Ross Ice Shelf</ORGANIZATION> and mountains poking through ice near <LOCATION>McMurdo</LOCATION> Sound.
   ``This is the first time we've had a chance to use a spacecraft
designed to explore another planet to come back and look at our own
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and moon as if we were alien observers,'' <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> said.
   ``In the process, we're learning some new scientific things
about our own world and its companion, but perhaps more
importantly, it's providing us a different perspective on our own
home planet as a fragile world,'' he said.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> is the first craft equipped with modern instruments to
study the far side of the moon and photographed some regions for
the first time, said <PERSON>Clark Chapman</PERSON>, a researcher from the <ORGANIZATION>Planetary
Science Institute</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Tucson</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ariz</LOCATION>.
   ``We're going to learn a lot about the geology of the back side
of the moon,'' <PERSON>Chapman</PERSON> said. ``It's been a fantastic lunar mission
already.''
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> plans to release more pictures <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> and hopes to
display a movie made of 1,400 still images showing clouds moving
above the spinning <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   Some unreleased pictures were displayed <DATE>Thursday</DATE> during a <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>
closed-circuit television broadcast. They showed closeup views of
clouds drifting above <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> and more distant peeks at <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>India</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Baja California</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Andes</LOCATION>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> was launched from space shuttle Atlantis on <DATE>Oct. 18,
1989</DATE>.
   It was to have been sent on a direct, two-year flight to
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>. But after the <DATE>1986</DATE> explosion that destroyed the shuttle
Challenger, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> decided it was too risky to launch <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> from
the shuttle using a powerful liquid-fueled rocket. A weaker booster
was used, requiring <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> to use the gravity of Venus and Earth
to make a looping 2.4-billion-mile, six-year voyage.

GALILEO SPACECRAFT RIGHT ON TARGET FOR EARTH FLYBY DEC. 8 
</P>

<P>
After taking a brief look at <LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> spacecraft is speeding toward a 
close encounter with Earth <DATE>Dec. 8</DATE> on its long journey to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> and it is 
expected to hit its desired course almost on the button, scientists reported 
<DATE>Thursday</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists had tried to block the launch of <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> last year because 
its instruments draw their energy from nuclear power, and some feared that a 
launch failure or a subsequent collision with <ORGANIZATION>Earth</ORGANIZATION> could release deadly 
radioisotopes into the atmosphere. But there is no chance of that, scientists 
said, because <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will be within about 16 miles of its desired course, 
passing 590 miles over the surface of the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will make an even closer Earth flyby in two years, passing less than 
200 miles from the planet on its way to its ultimate destination, <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>. But 
nothing about the spacecraft has given officials with the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics 
and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION> anything to worry about. 
</P>
<P>
"The spacecraft's health is excellent," said <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> project manager <PERSON>William J. 
O'Neil</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
Galileo is functioning so well that "we don't have to do anything on the ground 
or anything on the spacecraft" to successfully zip by the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and use gravity 
to boost its speed by about 15,000 m.p.h. That is one of several maneuvers that 
<ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will go through in order to reach <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, where it will conduct a 
two-year study of the Jovian system. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, plans did not call for <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> to fly past either Venus or Earth, 
but a new course had to be developed after changes in the space program 
resulting from the Challenger disaster precluded the use of a rocket powerful 
enough to send it on a direct course to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>. So both <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> are 
bonuses along the way, and scientists expect to make full use of both 
opportunities to study planets that are very similar in some ways, but quite 
different in others. 
</P>
<P>
The Earth flyby will be unique in that, for the first time, a spacecraft will 
reveal the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> as it would appear to an alien spacecraft flying through the 
solar system. The flyby is expected to produce some first-ever pictures of the 
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and the moon. 
</P>
<P>
"We will see portions of the far side of the moon that have never been looked 
at with modern sensors," said <PERSON>Torrence V. Johnson</PERSON> of <LOCATION>JPL</LOCATION>, the project 
scientist. 
</P>
<P>
The images that <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will send back as it speeds toward <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, as well as 
the thousands of photographs it will take of <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> and that planet's moons, 
could be exceptionally rewarding because the camera aboard <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> is capable 
of creating extremely sharp images in very low light, scientists said. 
</P>
<P>
According to <PERSON>Michael Belton</PERSON>, leader of the imaging team, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s camera is 
about 100 times as sensitive to light as the cameras that sent back spectacular 
images from the two Voyagers as they explored the outer reaches of the solar 
system. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s visit to <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> has been upstaged by <ORGANIZATION>JPL</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> spacecraft, which 
uses a radar camera to pierce through the sulfur dioxide clouds that hide the 
planet's surface, but at least it gave scientists a chance to check out their 
instruments and pick up a little precious data on the brilliant white planet. 
</P>
<P>
The data, collected in <DATE>February</DATE>, was stored aboard the spacecraft until <DATE>last 
week</DATE>, when <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> was close enough to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> to transmit it back. Scientists 
have spent the last few days devouring the information. 
</P>
<P>
"Christmas came early this year," <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
And there were a few surprises. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s instruments detected a concentration of electrons 
traveling at far higher speeds than would have been expected. 
</P>
<P>
The electrons apparently were accelerated to the extraordinary speeds because 
of some "interaction" of Venus with the million-mile-an-hour wind blowing off 
the sun. Asked the significance of the discovery, <PERSON>Louis Frank</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>University 
of Iowa</ORGANIZATION>, head of the plasma science team, said: 
</P>
<P>
"It shows our ignorance of how to push particles around the solar system." 
</P>
<P>
The photos of Venus taken by <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> do not rival the sharp radar images that 
<ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> has been sending back for the last few weeks, but scientists embraced 
them anyway because they reveal additional details about the clouds that cover 
<PERSON>Venus</PERSON>. That, in turn, is important because it gives scientists a chance to 
study the atmosphere of a planet that evolved quite differently from the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"We are living in an atmosphere that we are changing," <LOCATION>Belton</LOCATION> said, referring 
to the global warming effect that many scientists believe is taking place on 
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. "If you don't want the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> to change into something like that (Venus), 
then you better learn about atmospheres." 
</P>
<P>
Venus has an atmosphere that is rich in carbon dioxide, so it has already 
experienced the greenhouse effect. It is also devoid of life.

SHUTTLE ALOFT, SENDS GALILEO ON 6-YEAR VOYAGE TO JUPITER 
</P>

KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Fla. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The shuttle Atlantis roared into space <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> on the first leg of the most 
ambitious planetary mission to date. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>, the most sophisticated unmanned spacecraft ever built, was released 
from the shuttle's cargo bay six hours after the <TIME>9:53 a.m. PDT launching</TIME> and is 
finally on its way to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>. It was a launching that some scientists were 
beginning to think they might never see. 
</P>
<P>
The spectacular liftoff, which had been delayed several times, marked both a 
beginning and an end. 
</P>
<P>
It marked the end of years of frustration for scientists and engineers who 
built the <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> and then watched it narrowly escape the scrap heap several 
times. 
</P>
<P>
"It was definitely a special day for them," launch director <PERSON>Robert Sieck</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was worth the wait," said <PERSON>Richard Young</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Ames Research Center</ORGANIZATION> in 
<LOCATION>Mountain View</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, one of the principal scientists on the project. "It was 
fantastic." 
</P>
<P>
Atlantis commander <PERSON>Donald E. Williams</PERSON>, 47, could not have agreed more. "We're 
happy to be here," he said as the shuttle orbited 184 miles above <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
And the launching signaled the beginning of what promises to be a spectacular 
journey through space. It will take six years for <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> to reach <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, the 
largest planet in the solar system; but, along the way, the spacecraft will 
tour the inner solar system and its camera will even offer humans their first 
view of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> as it would be seen by visitors from outer space. 
</P>
<P>
For a while, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> officials considered scrapping the <MONEY>$1.4-billion</MONEY> project as 
the space agency struggled to rebuild after the Challenger explosion. 
Scientists who had invested much of their careers in the project held their 
breaths as <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> reevaluated the mission. 
</P>
<P>
Galileo had been designed to be put into low Earth orbit by the shuttle and 
then use a liquid-fueled engine to blast itself on to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>. But, because of 
concerns about safety after the Challenger disaster, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> decided to prohibit 
liquid fuel in the shuttle's cargo bay, leaving <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> with a great itinerary 
but no way to travel. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> was saved when engineers at the <ORGANIZATION>Jet Propulsion Laboratory</ORGANIZATION> came up with 
a way of getting the spacecraft to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> without using liquid fuel. It could 
be done, they concluded, by using a safer solid rocket motor to push <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> 
beyond <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s grasp. 
</P>
<P>
The solid rocket is not powerful enough to give <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> the speed it will need 
to reach the outer solar system, so <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will have to take the scenic back 
roads to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
After <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> was released from the shuttle's cargo bay, it used its rocket to 
slow itself down as it sped around <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The reduced speed left <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> falling toward the sun. But, in <DATE>February</DATE>, 
<ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will pass close enough to Venus to use that planet's gravity to change 
its course. Venus will swing <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> around and throw it back toward <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
In <DATE>December of 1990</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will come within 600 miles of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, whipping 
around its home base for the first time and using <ORGANIZATION>Earth</ORGANIZATION>'s gravity to slingshot 
itself through the asteroid belt outside of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s orbit. Ten months later, 
<ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> is to pass within about 600 miles of the asteroid Gaspra for the first 
encounter with an asteroid, snapping pictures and studying this remnant of the 
early solar system. 
</P>
<P>
In <DATE>December of 1992</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will make a daringly close approach to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, 
passing within about 185 miles and using the planet's gravity to boost its 
speed by 8,000 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
If all goes well, that should give <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> the speed it will need to reach 
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
It is the second encounter with Earth that most worries anti-nuclear 
protesters, who tried to block the launching. 
</P>
<P>
Galileo carries about 48 pounds of toxic plutonium 238, which it uses to 
generate electricity to run its many instruments. The protesters, who had also 
feared a launching disaster, worry that, if <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> accidentally plunges down 
into <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s atmosphere during that close flyby, the plutonium -- which is in a 
solid, ceramic form and packaged in steel canisters -- could somehow be 
vaporized and spread around the world. 
</P>
<P>
That would require multiple failures, which <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> judged to be highly unlikely. 
In the end, the courts ruled for <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>, and protesters did not try to physically 
disrupt <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>'s launching. 
</P>
<P>
Although <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will send data back to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> during its entire journey, the 
most important payday will occur when the three-ton spacecraft, carrying a 
total of 16 scientific instruments, encounters <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will loop 
around <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> and its moons for two years, capturing close-up pictures of the 
planet and its moons with a high-resolution camera that will make the images 
from the Voyager spacecraft look like snapshots. 
</P>
<P>
About 150 days before <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> reaches <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, the spacecraft will release a 
probe designed to plunge into the gaseous planet's heart, sending back data 
until it is crushed by the dense layers of gas. 
</P>
<P>
Atlantis is scheduled to land at <ORGANIZATION>Edwards Air Force Base</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION> 
on <DATE>Monday</DATE> at <TIME>12:39 p.m</TIME>. The shuttle's pilot is <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> Cmdr. <PERSON>Michael J. McCulley</PERSON>. 
Other members of the crew are <PERSON>Shannon W. Lucid</PERSON>, <PERSON>Franklin Chang-Diaz</PERSON> and <PERSON>Ellen 
S. Baker</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
RETURN TO <ORGANIZATION>JUPITER</ORGANIZATION> 
</P>
<P>
After a flight lasting six years, the <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> probe will separate into two 
parts as it approaches <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>. The orbiter section will circle the planet for 
at least 22 months. The probe capsule will descend into the planet's atmosphere 
and make direct measurements until it is destroyed by the high-pressure gases 
there. 
</P>
<P>
GALILEO'S FLIGHT PATH 
</P>
<P>
The spacecraft was originally designed to make a 2 1/2-year direct flight to 
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>. Changes after the Challenger disaster resulted in a six-year flight 
path using flybys of the planets <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> and Earth to build up enough speed to 
reach <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> scientists said <DATE>Sunday</DATE> they plan to
launch ``the <ORGANIZATION>Rolls-Royce</ORGANIZATION> of spacecraft'' from a space shuttle <DATE>Oct.
12</DATE>, catapulting the ship <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> so it can parachute a
probe into the giant planet's atmosphere.
   During its looping voyage toward a <DATE>December 1995</DATE> rendezvous with
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, the spacecraft will fly by <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>, pass <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> twice, see
parts of the moon not seen since the early <DATE>1960s</DATE> and make the first
close approach to an asteroid, the researchers said.
   The swings past <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> will catapult the spacecraft to
higher speeds so that it can reach <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> with the least
expenditure of fuel, the researchers said.
   When it passes <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will observe gases that cause
``greenhouse effect'' warming of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s atmosphere, study depletion
of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s protective ozone layer, and make detailed observations of
parts of the moon for which only relatively primitive maps from the
early <DATE>1960s</DATE> are available, said <PERSON>Torrence Johnson</PERSON>, the project
scientist.
   ``The <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> spacecraft is a marvel,'' <PERSON>Neal Ausman Jr.</PERSON>, the
mission director, said during a news conference at <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet
Propulsion Laboraory. ``It is the most complex spacecraft we've ever
flown at <ORGANIZATION>JPL</ORGANIZATION> _ probably the most complex spacecraft ever.''
   <PERSON>Clayne Yeates</PERSON>, acting science and mission design manager, called
<ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> the ``the <ORGANIZATION>Rolls-Royce</ORGANIZATION> of spacecraft,'' with an array of
scientific instruments that will allow far more detailed images and
scientific data on <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> and its moons than could be obtained by
the twin Voyager spacecraft.
   Among the innovations is a new imaging device that will allow
researchers to take a picture every two-and-one-third seconds. The
television cameras on Voyager 2 can take a picture only once every
50 or 60 seconds, said <PERSON>Yeates</PERSON>.
   Voyager 2 is flying past the planet <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> <DATE>this week</DATE>, the climax
of its 12-year, 4.4-billion trek past four planets. It explored
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1979</DATE>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will drop a probe by parachute into the Jovian atmosphere
to make detailed observations. <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s atmosphere is covered with
ammonia clouds and may contain ice clouds and water droplets
underneath.
   Researchers expect to get data on lightning bolts 10,000 to
100,000 times as strong as those seen on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will pass
600 miles from the Jovian moon Io, which has the most active
volcanoes in the solar system.
   The shuttle Atlantis is scheduled to carry <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> into <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>
orbit <DATE>Oct. 12</DATE>, then launch the spacecraft. <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will be boosted
into a trajectory that will take it looping around <LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION>, where it
will study the planet's atmosphere and make an attempt to confirm
the existence of lightning there.
   Galileo then will swing back past <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> in <DATE>December 1990</DATE>, using
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s gravity as a slingshot to pick up speed.
   Its next stop will be the asteroid belt between <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> and Mars,
where in <DATE>October 1991</DATE> it will pass 600 miles from the asteroid
Gaspra, a typical asteroid about 10 miles long.
   ``We don't have any pictures of asteroids,'' said <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON>.
``Nobody's been by one.''
   The spacecraft then will swing past <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> again before being sent
on its way to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>. It may have a second opportunity to pass by
an asteroid in <DATE>August 1993</DATE>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will make about 10 orbits around <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, passing closest
to Io but also near <LOCATION>Europa</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Ganymede</LOCATION>, two other Jovian moons.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> mission has been repeatedly delayed since work began
in <DATE>1977</DATE>, at which time launch was set for <DATE>1982</DATE>. Budget cuts during
the <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> administration, design changes and the explosion of the
Challenger space shuttle all contributed to the delay, said <PERSON>John
Casani</PERSON>, former project manager and now in charge of all flight
projects at <ORGANIZATION>JPL</ORGANIZATION>.

<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In <DATE>1990</DATE> and again in <DATE>1992</DATE>, the most
sophisticated space probe ever built will visit a planet with vast
oceans, a churning, molten interior and a rocky surface scarred by
earthquakes and active volcanoes.
   That planet is <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> spacecraft, scheduled for launch aboard the space
shuttle Atlantis on <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, is ultimately bound for <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>. But
its long, looping trajectory will sling it twice around its home
planet before dispatching it to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>.
   That makes <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> the first spacecraft to approach Earth from
interplanetary space.
   ``It's showing people what the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> would look like to an
extraterrestrial,'' said <PERSON>Torrence Johnson</PERSON>, project scientist on the
<ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> mission. ``We've never conducted a mission to planet Earth
like this before. We're going to go in and see what this place
looks like.''
   In addition to making observations concerning the greenhouse
effect and the Antarctic ozone hole, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will film what
scientists are calling the Earth movie, proposed by astronomer and
writer <PERSON>Carl Sagan</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Cornell University</ORGANIZATION>.
   In the movie, the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> will appear as a thin, distant crescent,
then gradually fill the frame and expand until surface objects 10
feet across are visible.
   As the spacecraft pulls away from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s sunlit side, it will
take a backward-looking shot showing five days of the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s
rotation, with the moon silently sweeping past as the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> recedes.
   ``A continuous zoom movie like that would be, it seems to me,
spectacular in reminding us of our position in space, of the tiny
planet that we're on,'' <PERSON>Sagan</PERSON> said.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will also, at <LOCATION>Sagan</LOCATION>'s suggestion, use its
state-of-the-art instruments to map the atmosphere for methane,
carbon dioxide and other gases responsible for global warming. And
on its first pass, it will peer directly down into the ozone hole
over <LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION>.
   ``<ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> has such capable and novel instruments, it seemed to
me important to do something about understanding the dangers to the
global environment,'' <PERSON>Sagan</PERSON> said.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> is returning to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> only to pick up a boost in speed
from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s gravity as it begins its six-year journey. After its
launch, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will get a gravity kick by passing around <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>,
pick up more speed with the two passes by <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and then begin its
primary mission to orbit <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, explore its moons and dispatch a
probe into <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s atmosphere.
   ``We wouldn't do anything on the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> encounters if we thought
it would jeopardize the primary mission,'' said <PERSON>Fraser P. Fanale</PERSON> of
the <ORGANIZATION>University of Hawaii</ORGANIZATION>, who is in charge of <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>
science objectives.
   Scientists say the <MONEY>$1.4 billion</MONEY> probe's investigation of <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>
and its moons will be the most scientifically rich that
interplanetary exploration has witnessed. The <DATE>1979</DATE> Voyager views of
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> and its satellites were fascinating, but <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s images
will be 1,000 times clearer, they say.
   In <DATE>1995</DATE>, a smaller probe is to be fired by <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> into
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s cloud layers and make the first direct sampling of the
Jovian atmosphere. The probe will transmit data until it is crushed
and vaporized by extreme heat and pressure.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will orbit the planet gathering information on
temperatures, magnetic fields, radiation, cloud characteristics,
gravity fields and the dynamics of a weather system that produces
such phenomena as the mysterious Great Red Spot, a centuries-old
storm larger than <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   The spacecraft was initially scheduled for launch in <DATE>1982</DATE> on a
direct course to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, but it has been delayed repeatedly as
<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> wrangled over <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> financing and as
the space shuttle program fell far behind schedule.
   On <DATE>Sept. 28</DATE>, activists filed a suit seeking to prevent the
launch of the spacecraft because it is powered by plutonium. They
said a shuttle accident could spread toxic plutonium in populated
areas, but <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> said its evaluations indicated the risk of
contamination was very low.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will do more than observe the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> as it makes its way
to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>. It will be the first spacecraft with modern instruments
to observe the dark side of the moon. ``There are a lot of things
we don't know about the far side of the moon,'' said <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON>.
``It's been very difficult and frustrating to try to put together a
picture of the whole moon from the data we have.''
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will also search for ice in the shaded craters near the
moon's north pole and study the soil for clues to the evolution of
the moon's crust and its interior.
   The spacecraft will be active as it passes by <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>, searching
for cloud patterns and possibly lightning. And it will visit at
least one and maybe two asteroids in the asteroid belt between Mars
and <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>.
   Its observations of the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and moon may help resolve a debate
about the ``space snowballs'' hypothesis of <PERSON>Louis A. Frank</PERSON> of the
<ORGANIZATION>University of Iowa</ORGANIZATION>.
   The theory holds that the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s lakes and oceans come from
precipitation caused by the melting of small comets bombarding the
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s atmosphere at the rate of 10 million a year.
   If that's true, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> should be able to spot hydrogen clouds
around the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and the moon, the result of the comets' water
molecules disintegrating. It should also detect water vapor rising
from the moon as comets collide with its surface.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will make the most accurate measurements yet of the
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s mass, and it will study the sparkling ultraviolet
``airglow'' caused by the interaction of solar radiation with the
atmosphere.
   It may also show whether the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> is shadowed by a ring of
interplanetary dust around the sun, as some scientists have
proposed.
   All of these observations have another purpose, too. ``We may
learn things about using the spacecraft that would be valuable at
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON>.
   Finally, the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> observations have what <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> calls ``the
surprise component.'' The two Voyager flights to the outer planets
consistently revealed features of the planets that hadn't even been
imagined. Could a fresh look at <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> do the same?
   ``I would not want to bet against finding some things people
hadn't thought about,'' <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> said. ``Who knows?''

<TEXT>
   From 3.8 billion miles, the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> is a blue dot
in an ocean of black.
   ``On that blue dot, that's where everyone you know, everyone you
ever heard of, every human being who ever lived, lived out their
life,'' astronomer <PERSON>Carl Sagan</PERSON> said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> as <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> released an
extraordinary photo taken from a vantage point in deep space.
   Voyager 1, speeding toward the edge of the solar system, looked
back in <DATE>February</DATE> and snapped photos of six of the nine planets that
whirl around the sun.
   The photograph, actually a mosaic of 64 images taken in a
four-hour period, was the last from the spacecraft. The pictures
were recorded <DATE>Feb. 13-14</DATE> but were not played back to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> until
late <DATE>March</DATE> because deep-space radio receivers were occupied with
higher priority tasks.
   The camera looked down from 32 degrees above the ecliptic plane _
the track in which most of the planets orbit the sun. It captured
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, Uranus, <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>.
   Mars was washed out by the sun, <ORGANIZATION>Mercury</ORGANIZATION> was too close to the sun
to be photographed and <LOCATION>Pluto</LOCATION> was too far away and too small to
appear. By happenstance, <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> was within a band of sunlight but
<PERSON>Sagan</PERSON> said it had no special significance.
   The twin spacecraft, Voyager 1 and Voyager 2, were launched in
<DATE>August</DATE> and <DATE>September 1977</DATE> from <LOCATION>Cape Canaveral</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla</LOCATION>. Between them,
they explored all the giant outer planets of the solar system, 48 of
their moons and the systems of rings and magnetic fields of those
planets.
   <ORGANIZATION>Edward Stone of the California Institute of Technology</ORGANIZATION>, chief
scientist on the Voyager project, said he expected the Voyagers to
leave the solar system and cruise into interstellar space sometime
between the years <DATE>2000</DATE> and <DATE>2010</DATE>. Voyager 1 is heading outward at a
rate of nearly a million miles a day.
   Sagan was asked what had been learned from the Voyagers that
would change descriptions of the solar system published in
encyclopedias in <DATE>1975</DATE>.
   ``I would say you would simply tear them up,'' he replied. The
knowledge gained from the space probes ``have wholly changed our
knowledge of the solar system.''
   Stone said the greatest discovery was that Io, a moon circling
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, had active volcanoes _ the first such discovery on another
body in the solar system. The Voyagers together observed nine
volcanic eruptions on Io.
   He showed reporters time-lapse pictures that showed graphically
that other storms meld into <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s Great Red Spot, and that
storms circle the planet moving in opposite directions.
   Voyager showed that Uranus, a planet tipped on its side, also has
a previously undiscovered magnetic field that is tilted 60 degrees
from the planet's axis of rotation.
   Sagan recalled that the first successful planetary mission
occurred when Mariner 2 flew past Venus in <DATE>1962</DATE>.
   ``In 27 years the human species has flown close by or landed on
every planet in the solar system except <LOCATION>Pluto</LOCATION>,'' he said. Still,
``we have no evidence, not a smidgen of evidence, suggesting life
anywhere else.''

<HEAD>New Survey Finds Most Americans Are ``Scientific Illiterates''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLES J. GANS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 450 years after <PERSON>Copernicus</PERSON> proved the
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> revolves around the sun, millions of adult Americans seem to
think it's the other way around, a researcher said <DATE>Sunday</DATE>.
   ``It's a fairly dire situation,'' said <PERSON>Jon Miller</PERSON>, director of
the <ORGANIZATION>Public Opinion Laboratory</ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION>Northern Illinois University</ORGANIZATION>, who
conducted a nationwide survey for the <ORGANIZATION>National Science Foundation</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``The results show that on very basic ideas, vast numbers of
Americans are scientifically illiterate,'' he said in a telephone
interview.
   In the telephone survey of 2,041 adults 18 or older, conducted
in <DATE>July</DATE>, people were asked about 75 questions testing their
knowledge of basic science, <PERSON>Miller</PERSON> said. The survey had a margin of
error of plus or minus <PERCENT>3 percent</PERCENT>.
   Asked whether the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> goes around the sun or the sun around
the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, <PERCENT>21 percent</PERCENT> replied incorrectly. Seven percent said they
didn't know.
   Of the <PERCENT>72 percent</PERCENT> who answered correctly, <PERCENT>45 percent</PERCENT> said it
takes one year for the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> to orbit the sun, <PERCENT>17 percent</PERCENT> said one
day, <PERCENT>2 percent</PERCENT> said <DATE>one month</DATE> and <PERCENT>9 percent</PERCENT> didn't know.
   The responses indicate that about <PERCENT>55 percent</PERCENT> of adult Americans,
or some 94 million people, don't know that the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> revolves
around the sun once a year, <PERSON>Miller</PERSON> said.
   ``It shows that there are basic misunderstandings about some of
the things we would have presumed virtually everyone would have
known,'' said <PERSON>Miller</PERSON>, a political science professor at <ORGANIZATION>Northern
Illinois University in DeKalb</ORGANIZATION>, about 60 miles west of <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>.
   A similar survey conducted by the polling group in <DATE>1985</DATE>
indicated that only about <PERCENT>5 percent</PERCENT> of adult Americans could be
considered ``scientifically literate,'' with basic knowledge of
scientific vocabulary, methodology and an understanding of the
impact of science on the world, <PERSON>Miller</PERSON> said.
   <PERSON>Miller</PERSON> said the latest results, which haven't been fully
tabulated yet, should put the literacy rate in the 5 to <PERCENT>7 percent</PERCENT>
range. The survey results will be incorporated into an <ORGANIZATION>National
Science Foundation</ORGANIZATION> report to be issued next year on the state of
American science and technology.
   <PERSON>Leon Lederman</PERSON>, who was named co-winner of the <DATE>1988</DATE> Nobel Prize
for physics, called the latest findings ``pretty devastating.''
   ``I'm not surprised ... but it's much worse than anyone had
expected,'' he said <DATE>Sunday</DATE> in a telephone interview. ``How you can
preserve democracy when the world is increasingly more complex
scientifically and technologically, and people are increasingly
more ignorant of the issues.''
   <PERSON>Lederman</PERSON> said he plans to retire next year as director of the
<ORGANIZATION>Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Batavia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ill.</LOCATION>, to teach
physics to freshmen at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Chicago</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``Get them while they're young ... if you get them as a senior
it's too late,'' he said. ``We have to roll up our sleeves and get
to work ... to improve and solve the scientific literacy question.''
   In an election year, in which candidates are talking about
issues like the <ORGANIZATION>Strategic Defense Initiative</ORGANIZATION>, acid rain, the
greenhouse effect and the space race, the survey results indicate
many Americans have little idea of what the candidates are talking
about, <PERSON>Miller</PERSON> said.
   Asked a true-false question on whether lasers _ an essential
component of the <ORGANIZATION>Star Wars</ORGANIZATION> defense system _ work by focusing sound
waves, only <PERCENT>36 percent</PERCENT> of the respondents correctly answered the
statement was false. Twenty-nine percent thought it was true and <PERCENT>35
percent</PERCENT> said they didn't know.
   Lasers work by focusing light waves.
   ``I think the next president and <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> have to face this
issue (of scientific illiteracy) in some fashion or the other,'' he
said.
   <PERSON>Miller</PERSON> says schools deserve a lot of blame for doing a poor job
in teaching math and science.

<HEAD>Spacecraft Snaps More Venus Pictures After Glitch is Fixed</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> space ship cruised on the
next leg of its 2.4-billion mile, six-year trip to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> after
engineers replaced faulty computer commands that made the craft act
like a mad shutterbug.
   Galileo snapped 16 planned photos of Venus on <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, but for
about five hours the shutter on the spacecraft's electronic camera
opened and closed 452 times when it wasn't supposed to do so. None
of those unintended exposures were recorded.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> engineers sent the 2.8-ton <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> new computer commands
late <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, and the camera was able to snap 38 pictures, right
on schedule, of cloud-shrouded Venus in a series that ended <DATE>Sunday</DATE>
<TIME>morning</TIME>.
   ``They seem to understand what happened, and they're not
concerned about any repeats,'' said <PERSON>Bob MacMillin</PERSON>, spokesman for
the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> is now flying back toward Earth so the planet can act as
a gravity slingshot on <DATE>Dec. 8</DATE> to help the spacecraft reach <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>
in <DATE>1995</DATE> in a <MONEY>$1.35 billion</MONEY> mission to explore the solar system's
largest planet.
   Galileo swooped about 10,000 miles above the 900-degree
Fahrenheit surface of Venus at <TIME>9:59 p.m. PST</TIME> <DATE>Friday</DATE> in the
mission's first ``gravity assist maneuver.'' Venus helped increase
<ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s speed by almost 5,000 mph, giving it enough energy to get
to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>.
   After the flyby, the spacecraft took 16 pictures to study
Venusian cloud and wind patterns and look for lightning. The camera
bugs then developed.
   MacMillin said engineers determined <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s camera and
computer were fine, and that the problem was in a computer program
sent from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> to tell <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> what to do and when to do it.
   The problem was caused by improper timing between various
commands within the computer program, <PERSON>MacMillin</PERSON> said.
   He said such problems are not unusual on a spacecraft as new as
<ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>. The craft was deployed <DATE>Oct. 18</DATE> from the cargo bay of space
shuttle Atlantis, then launched by a solid-fueled booster to start
its looping 2.4-billion-mile, six-year trip to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>.
   The spacecraft was programmed to continue looking back at Venus
until late this <DATE>Friday</DATE>, taking 27 more photos and using other
sensors to detect dust, infrared and visible light, and
electrically charged particles.
   The pictures and measurements are stored on the spacecraft's
tape recorder. Almost all of them will be sent back to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> in
<DATE>October</DATE> when <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> is close enough to send scientific information
using its small antenna.
   That antenna now can be used only to help run the spacecraft. A
large antenna currently is furled to protect it from the sun's heat.
   After swinging past <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> in <DATE>December</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will explore
asteroid Gaspra in <DATE>October 1991</DATE>, then make another flight past
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> on <DATE>Dec. 8, 1992</DATE>. The spacecraft may study asteroid Ida in
<DATE>August 1993</DATE> before <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> deploys a 760-pound probe in <DATE>July 1995</DATE>.
Galileo and the probe will reach <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>December 1995</DATE>.
   The probe will parachute into the planet's atmosphere, relaying
measurements to <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> until it is vaporized by intense heat and
pressure. <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will swoop past the moon Io and its
sulfur-spewing volcanoes, then go into orbit around <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> to
study the planet and moons <LOCATION>Europa</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Callisto</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Ganymede</LOCATION> at least
until late <DATE>1997</DATE>.

<HEAD>Jupiter-Bound Galileo Completes First Course Correction</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> spacecraft, speeding toward
a <DATE>1995</DATE> rendezvous with <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, successfully completed its first
course correction by firing its small thrusters more than 2,000
times, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> said.
   The three-day maneuver, which ended <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>, accelerated
the spacecraft by about 38 mph, bringing its speed to more than
60,000 mph relative to the sun, said <PERSON>Jim Wilson</PERSON>, spokesman for the
<ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
   The trajectory change is meant to put <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> in proper position
for its flight past Venus on <DATE>Feb. 9, 1990</DATE>. The spacecraft will
swoop by <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> once and Earth twice so the planets can act as
``gravity slingshots'' to propel <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> toward <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> during the
<MONEY>$1.9 billion</MONEY> mission.
   In <DATE>July 1995</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will separate into an orbiter and a probe.
The orbiter will circle <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> for 22 months starting <DATE>Dec. 7,
1995</DATE>, and the probe will parachute into the Jovian atmosphere,
making measurements for 75 minutes until it is crushed by intense
pressure.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> was launched from space shuttle Atlantis on <DATE>Oct. 18</DATE>. On
<DATE>Monday</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> was 5.3 million miles from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and 36.9 million
miles along its looping 2.4-billion-mile path to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>Wilson</PERSON> said several of <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s 12 thrusters fired a total of
2,000 brief pulses during the trajectory maneuver, the first of
about 30 course corrections needed to get the spacecraft to
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, the solar system's largest planet.
   A temperature sensor on one thruster malfunctioned <DATE>Friday</DATE>, so
another thruster was used <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, mission director <PERSON>Neal Ausman</PERSON>
said.

   The latest discoveries come from a far-off realm, Uranus,
relayed by Voyager 2, a marvelous machine launched along with
Voyager 1 in <DATE>1977</DATE> to probe <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION>. Voyager 2 was
working so well after exploring <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> that <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> reprogrammed it to
sail past Uranus in <DATE>1986</DATE> and <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> next <DATE>August</DATE>.
   Uranus is considered the oddball of the solar system because,
unlike the other planets, it lies tipped on its side with its north
and south poles alternately facing the sun. Voyager 2 found that
Uranus' magnetic field does not follow the usual north-south axis
and instead is tilted 60 degrees and offset at the center.
Astronomers believe it might have been knocked off course by an
ancient collision with another celestial object.
   Voyager 2 found that winds on Uranus whip up to 450 mph and blow
from the west instead of the east as previously suspected. About
5,000 miles below the planet's cloudtops, the spacecraft detected
evidence of a boiling ocean of water and dissolved ammonia some
6,000 miles deep. Beneath this ocean, it is believed there is an
Earth-size molten core of heavier materials.
   The spacecraft discovered 10 new moons orbiting Uranus, ranging
from 24 to 102 miles in diameter, much smaller than the planet's
previously recorded five satellites. Uranus was thought to have
nine rings; Voyager found 11. In contrast to <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION>'s rings, which
are composed of bright grain-sized particles, Uranus' rings are
made up of dark boulder-sized chunks.
   The Voyagers also discovered a ring around <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, the largest
planet in the solar system and a valuable astronomical laboratory
because of the diversity of its system of at least 16 moons.
   During the flyby encounters, the Voyagers and the earlier
Pioneers 10 and 11, found <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> to be a whirling ball of liquid
hydrogen, topped by a uniquely colorful atmosphere which is mostly
hydrogen and helium. They learned the Great Red Spot, observed for
centuries through Earth-based telescopes, is a tremendous
atmospheric storm similar to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s hurricanes.
   The space probes detected lightning in <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s upper
atmosphere and observed auroral emissions like <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s northern
lights in the Jovian polar regions. Jupiter spins at a dizzying
pace _ once every 9 hours, 55 minutes, 30 seconds _ but it takes
the massive planet almost 12 Earth years to complete a journey
around the sun.
   Before Pioneer 11 and the Voyagers passed by <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION>, astronomers
knew the planet only as a fuzzy yellow sphere surrounded by six
rings. The startling images relayed back quickly identified several
thousand rings made up of small ice particles orbiting the planet
at various speeds.
   The spacecraft discovered five new Saturnian moons, raising the
total to 17. Titan, the largest, received the most attention
because it is the only moon in the solar system believed to have an
atmosphere. Although it is inconceivable that life could exist in
the oceans of liquid nitrogen and freezing hydrocarbons believed to
form <ORGANIZATION>Titan</ORGANIZATION>'s surface, scientists are intrigued by the possibility
that the giant moon may hold clues about the formation of organic
molecules in the atmosphere of the primeval <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> between three and
four billion years ago.
   The Voyagers also found <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION>'s atmosphere of hydrogen and
helium alive with monster storms, with winds of 1,100 mph.
   Venus, our sister planet and closest neighbor, more nearly
resembles Earth in size, physical composition and density than any
of the other planets. However, <ORGANIZATION>Mariner</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Pioneer</ORGANIZATION> probes found
that <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> is a blistering hot world where the 900-degree heat is
trapped in a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide.
   Radar peering through <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' thick cloud cover found evidence of
two major active volcano areas. The concentration of lightning over
these areas suggests frequent eruptions. A valley may have been
created by tension in the planet's crust pulling the surface apart
like similar processes on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   Photographs taken of <ORGANIZATION>Mercury</ORGANIZATION> by <ORGANIZATION>Mariner</ORGANIZATION> 10 in <DATE>1974</DATE> and <DATE>1975</DATE>
revealed an ancient, heavily cratered surface, closely resembling
our own moon. The pictures also showed huge cliffs crisscrossing
the planet.
   Instruments aboard <ORGANIZATION>Mariner</ORGANIZATION> 10 found that <ORGANIZATION>Mercury</ORGANIZATION> has a weak
magnetic field and a trace of an atmosphere - a trillionth the
density of the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s and composed chiefly of argon, neon and
helium. The spacecraft reported temperatures ranging from 950
degrees Fahrenheit on the sunlight side to 346 degrees below zero
on the shadowed side.
   Of all the planets, Mars has long been considered the solar
system's prime candidate for harboring extraterrestrial life. But
the results obtained by the Viking 1 and 2 landers in <DATE>1976</DATE> and <DATE>1977</DATE>
were teasingly inconclusive. Small samples of Martian soil were
scooped up and specially treated in three different experiments
designed to detect biological processes. While some of the tests
indicated biological processes were occuring, the same results
could be explained by the planet's chemistry. There was no evidence
of organic molecules in the small areas surveyed by the Vikings.
   The Vikings and earlier <ORGANIZATION>Mariners</ORGANIZATION> found that dust covers the
Martian surface under a sparse atmosphere that allows the wind to
stir up fierce <DATE>summer</DATE> storms. Massive active volcanoes dot the
landscape, and dry sinuous channels, perhaps carved long ago by
flowing water, stretch for hundreds of miles. Many scientists
believe water still lies below the surface, giving rise to
speculation that some form of life might yet be found there.

of <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Jet Propulsion Laboratory</ORGANIZATION> said as <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> observed the <DATE>fifth
anniversary of Pioneer 10</DATE>'s dash past <LOCATION>Pluto</LOCATION>'s orbit.
   Pioneer 10, launched in <DATE>1972</DATE> and now over 4 billion miles from
home even though it was guaranteed for only 21 months, also is
searching for long gravity waves proposed by <PERSON>Albert Einstein</PERSON>, and
the boundary of the sun's influence.
   The radio signals the 570-pound space probe is sending back _
from 45 times the distance between the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and the sun _ aren't
very powerful and take six hours to get here at the speed of light.
But they are important to researchers trying to solve some
classical puzzles about the universe.
   The energy of the craft's signals picked up by a 70-meter deep
space antenna would have to be accumulated for over <MONEY>11 billion</MONEY>
years to build up enough energy to light a 7{-watt nightlight for
one millisecond, said <PERSON>Richard O. Fimmel</PERSON>, project manager at the
<ORGANIZATION>NASA Ames Research Center</ORGANIZATION>.
   But the signals from Pioneer 10 and its twin, Pioneer 11,
launched in <DATE>1973</DATE>, are strong enough to send ``high quality data on
a daily basis,'' said physicist <PERSON>James Van Allen</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>University
of Iowa</ORGANIZATION>, a principal investigator on the Pioneer project.
   Van <PERSON>Allen</PERSON>, who discovered the radiation belts surrounding <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>,
said Pioneer 10 has literally and figuratively gone far beyond its
original missions to study <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> and the asteroid belt between
Mars and <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``One of the principal current objectives is the observation of
cosmic rays and the flow of the solar wind at heretofore unexplored
distances from the sun,'' Van <PERSON>Allen</PERSON> said.
   ``We now have a realistic expectation of finding the outer
boundary of the heliosphere, which is the sphere of influence of
the sun, and of penetrating into the nearby interstellar media,''
he said.
   But sadly, he said, Pioneer 10 may stop working before it
reaches the edge of the heliosphere.
   The tiny craft is expected to operate only another seven to 10
years, <PERSON>Fimmel</PERSON> said, and may run out of energy before it reaches
interstellar space.
   Before that, however, Pioneer 10 may give scientists clues to
the shape of the heliosphere.
   And it is relaying strong evidence suggesting Planet X or
possibly two smaller unknown planets exist.
   ``We have a 90 to <PERCENT>99 percent</PERCENT> confidence that Uranus and <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>
are being disturbed, and one candidate for that is a single Planet
X,'' said <PERSON>Anderson</PERSON>. ``It's conceivable there could be other
gravitational effects on the two orbits.
   ``We haven't ruled out other matter which could be in orbit
around the sun,'' he said. ``It could be small particulate matter.
It could be more than one planet that are very small. The best
hypothesis is a single planet X at one to four <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> masses.''
   Such a planet, he said, would likely be a mixture of ice and
rock.
   Pioneer 10 made its closest approach to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> _ 82,000 miles _
on <DATE>Dec. 3, 1973</DATE>, 21 months after it was launched, after traveling
an arc-shaped 620 million-mile path from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   It was the first spacecraft to cross the Asteroid Belt, fly past
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> and return pictures, chart <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s intense radiation
belts, measure the mass of its four planet-sized moons, and
discover that <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> is predominantly a liquid planet.
   Pioneer 11 encountered <DATE>Jupiter a year later</DATE>, then reached <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION>
on <DATE>Sept. 1, 1979</DATE>.
   Both craft, though partly damaged along the way, far exceeded
their operations guarantee of at least 21 months. A spokesman for
<ORGANIZATION>TRW Inc.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Redondo Beach</LOCATION> joked <DATE>Monday</DATE> that the company would fix
anything wrong with the two Pioneers if <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> could bring them back.

<TEXT>
   Here are some facts, figures and
theories about <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>, the planet visited early today by the
Jupiter-bound <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> spacecraft:
   DIAMETER: About 7,520 miles, or <PERCENT>95 percent</PERCENT> as wide as <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, and
sixth largest of the solar system's nine known planets.
   MASS: Venus weighs about <PERCENT>82 percent</PERCENT> as much as <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   ATMOSPHERE: About <PERCENT>96 percent</PERCENT> carbon dioxide and most of the rest
nitrogen, but with thick clouds of sulfuric acid and water vapor.
The atmosphere traps heat in a runaway ``greenhouse effect'' that
scientists believe evaporated liquid water long ago.
   SURFACE CONDITIONS: Temperature about 900 degrees Fahrenheit.
Crushing atmospheric pressure 90 times that on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   DAY LENGTH: Venus rotates on its axis very slowly, so one day on
Venus equals 243 Earth days. Its rotation is retrograde, so the sun
rises in the west and sets in the east.
   YEAR LENGTH: Venus orbits the sun once every 225 Earth days.
   DISTANCE FROM THE SUN: Venus is the second planet from the sun,
orbiting at a distance of 67.2 million miles. It is closer to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>
than any other planet. Other than the sun and moon, <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> is the
brightest object in <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s skies.
   MOONS: None.
   GEOLOGY: Earth-based and spacecraft radar revealed hundreds of
thousands of volcanoes on the Venusian lowlands, although
scientists don't yet know if any are active. Venus also has
meteorite impact craters and continent-like highlands with towering
peaks that dwarf Earth's tallest mountains. Scientists suspect
giant plates of rock may move in <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' crust in a process vaguely
like continental drift on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   GRAVITY: About <PERCENT>89 percent</PERCENT> as strong as on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.

   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>, the first <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> planetary
spacecraft launched since <DATE>1978</DATE>, fired its braking rocket and
dropped into orbit around <LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION> <DATE>today</DATE> on a mission to make the best
pictures yet of the planet's cloud-covered terrain.
   ``The system worked as planned. A lot of hard work was
rewarded,'' said <PERSON>George Alexander</PERSON>, chief spokesman for <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet
Propulsion Laboratory.
   ``I'm tremendously gratified we were able to do something for
<ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> and the public that shows this is a capable agency'' following
troubles with the shuttle fleet and the <ORGANIZATION>Hubble Space Telescope</ORGANIZATION>, he
said. ``This breaks the string of bad luck.''
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> dived over <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' north pole, then ignited the
forward-facing rocket at <TIME>9:32 a.m.</TIME>, slowing from about 24,600 mph
to roughly 18,500 mph.
   That allowed <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> to be captured by <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' gravity and start
orbiting the second planet from the sun, said mission commentator
<PERSON>Steve Wall</PERSON>.
   The rocket ignition happened when the spacecraft was behind
<PERSON>Venus</PERSON>, out of radio contact with engineers on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. Magellan
emerged at <TIME>9:53 a.m.</TIME>, but preliminary confirmation that all went
well came 13 minutes later because of the time <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s radio
signal takes to reach <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   ``We are now in orbit!'' said <PERSON>David Okerson</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> project
engineer.
   In the <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> project office, ``there was cheering and
applause and whistling and hooting'' by scientists and engineers,
said secretary <PERSON>Sharon Kyle</PERSON>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> encountered Venus 144 million miles from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> after
circling the sun 1{ times during a roundabout, 948-million-mile
journey.
   The <MONEY>$413 million</MONEY> <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>, the heart of a <MONEY>$744 million</MONEY> mission,
was designed to use radar to penetrate thick Venusian clouds,
allowing the spacecraft to make maps and pictures of the planet's
deformed, volcanic landscape with unprecedented detail. Mapping is
slated to start by <DATE>Sept. 1</DATE>.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> plans to release the first pictures in <DATE>September</DATE>, but may
do so this month if images made during tests produce any
interesting discoveries.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> has raised <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s hopes after its recent woes,
including the temporary grounding of the shuttle fleet because of
hydrogen leaks and a defective mirror that crippled the <MONEY>$1.5
billion</MONEY> <ORGANIZATION>Hubble Space Telescope</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``The major pressure we feel is the pressure to succeed,''
<PERSON>Wesley T. Huntress Jr.</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> director of solar system exploration,
said <DATE>Thursday</DATE>. ``I'd prefer not to speculate on what failure might
mean.''
   The 21-foot <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>, deployed from the shuttle Atlantis in <DATE>May
1989</DATE>, was the first <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> planetary spacecraft launched since <DATE>1978</DATE>,
when <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> sent the Pioneer 12 orbiter and the Pioneer 13 probes to
<PERSON>Venus</PERSON>.
   ``<ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> is the beginning of a new era of planetary
exploration,'' <PERSON>Huntress</PERSON> said. ``We're looking forward to the
drama.''
   The Voyager probes explored <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION>, Uranus and <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>
between <DATE>1979</DATE> and <DATE>last year</DATE>, but they were launched in <DATE>1977</DATE>.
<ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>, launched in <DATE>October</DATE>, is headed toward a <DATE>1995</DATE> rendezvous
with <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>.
   During the coming decade or so, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> also plans to send
spacecraft to explore Mars, the moon, <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION>, comets and the sun's
polar regions.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> has said <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> would return more data than all previous
<ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> missions combined.
   Venus is similar to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> in size, density and position in the
solar system, although a runaway ``greenhouse effect'' raised its
surface temperature to 900 degrees Fahrenheit, about as hot as a
self-cleaning oven.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> wants to learn if the planet's geological processes are
similar to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s. Venus has tens of thousands of volcanoes, but
no one knows if any are active.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> was named for the Portuguese explorer <ORGANIZATION>Ferdinand
Magellan</ORGANIZATION>, who sailed around the world in the early 1500s.
   The spacecraft was built by <ORGANIZATION>Martin Marietta Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and its radar
was built by <ORGANIZATION>Hughes Aircraft Co</ORGANIZATION>.

   After a 12-year, 4.4 billion-mile space
odyssey, Voyager 2 fired its thrusters today to take final aim
toward <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, the most distant and last unexplored planet due for
a visit by a spacecraft from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   ``This is the final movement in the Voyager symphony of the outer
planets,'' said Voyager project scientist <PERSON>Edward Stone</PERSON>, referring to
<ORGANIZATION>Voyager</ORGANIZATION>'s previous exploration of <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> and Uranus.
   ``We're in for a good ride, and it's great everybody can share in
the discoveries that are going to unfold in the <DATE>next week</DATE>,'' Stone
said during a <TIME>late morning</TIME> news conference.
   The small adjustment in direction today was the last needed to
target Voyager for <DATE>Thursday</DATE>'s close encounter with <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> and
<DATE>Friday</DATE>'s flight past its largest moon, <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>. The maneuver, meant
to nudge Voyager to the right and increased its speed a tiny 1.1
mph, means <ORGANIZATION>Voyager</ORGANIZATION> will fly closest to <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> about <TIME>8:55 p.m. PDT</TIME>
<DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   Engineers at <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory received a signal
from the spacecraft at <TIME>8:15 a.m. PDT</TIME> <DATE>today</DATE> indicating the thrusters
started firing at <TIME>4:09 a.m</TIME>. It takes four hours and six minutes for
the signals to reach Earth, even at the 186,000-mile-per-second
speed of light.
   The approaching encounter with <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> has drawn scientists here
from all over the world.
   ``It's almost like being on a ship of discovery like <PERSON>Marco Polo</PERSON>,
<ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>,'' says <PERSON>Jurrie</PERSON> van der Woude, a laboratory
spokesman.
   ``For most of us, this is the last picture show, the last foreign
shores we visit in the solar system.''
   Today's schedule of activities for Voyager included searching for
northern lights around <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s north pole, studying the planet's
turbulent weather and snapping pictures of <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> and another moon,
<LOCATION>Nereid</LOCATION>. The probe also was programmed to make 39 images of the
region in which partial rings of debris may be orbiting the planet.
   As Voyager gets nearer to <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, cable television stations will
carry live <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> broadcasts of photographs from the planet.
   On its approach to the solar system's fourth-largest planet, the
picture-snapping space probe already has discovered four moons in
addition to <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> and Nereid, which had been discovered from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>,
as well as two partial rings of debris orbiting <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>.
   Voyager also discovered <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> has a magnetic field;
hurricane-like storms dubbed ``scooters'' with 400 mph winds;
2,700-mile-wide bands vaguely like <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s jet streams; and a
8,100-by-4,100-mile Great Dark Spot, probably a huge storm like
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s Great Red Spot.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> listed <ORGANIZATION>Voyager</ORGANIZATION>'s position as of <TIME>9 a.m.</TIME> <DATE>today</DATE> as 2.743
billion miles from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and 3.211 million miles from <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>,
approaching the planet at 42,310 mph. Since it was launched in <DATE>1977</DATE>,
Voyager 2 has traveled a curving path totaling 4.4 billion miles.
   With no one planning a mission to <LOCATION>Pluto</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> is the last
unexplored planet that will be visited by a spacecraft from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> in
the foreseeable future.
   <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, usually the eighth planet from the sun, currently is the
ninth and most distant. Pluto follows an elongated elliptical orbit
and is closer now.
   <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>, <ORGANIZATION>Voyager</ORGANIZATION> makes its closest approach to <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> by
skirting 3,000 miles above the planet's cloud tops _ much closer
than its encounters with <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1979</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1981</DATE> and Uranus
in <DATE>1986</DATE>.
   <DATE>Sunday</DATE> was the 12th anniversary of the spacecraft's launch from
<LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> on <DATE>Aug. 20, 1977</DATE>. The <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> encounter is the climax of the
<MONEY>$865 million</MONEY>, twin-spacecraft Voyager mission, which also saw
Voyager 1 explore <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1979</DATE> and <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1980</DATE>.
   Sending Voyager to <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> was like ``sinking a 2,260-mile golf
putt, assuming the golfer can make a few illegal fine adjustments
while the ball is rolling across this incredibly long green,''
according to ``The Voyager Neptune Travel Guide,'' written by
mission planning manager <PERSON>Charles Kohlhase</PERSON> and his staff.
   About 170 researchers from around the world are at the laboratory
for the <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> encounter. They will share ultimate exhilaration as
front-row observers for humanity's first close-up look at the
planet, a blue-green ball nearly four times <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s diameter.
   But their excitement is tinged with nostalgia because Voyager's
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> encounter will be the last planetary flyby for a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
spacecraft. Future probes will orbit their target planets: <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>
at <LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> and the Mars Observer.
   Up to 8,000 photographs from Voyager's two television cameras and
discoveries by 10 other science experiments are expected to pour in
so quickly that the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION>
will conduct daily news conferences through <DATE>Aug. 29</DATE>.
   Some scientists have said the planet may have 50 or more ring
arcs, different than the complete rings encircling <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> and Uranus.
   They also say <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s magnetic field may create auroras like
<ORGANIZATION>Earth</ORGANIZATION>'s northern lights, and also may trap orbiting radiation belts
similar to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s Van <PERSON>Allen</PERSON> belts.
   Today's course correction was designed to assure Voyager can aim
a radio signal at <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> when the probe starts to pass behind <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>.
   By measuring changes in the signal, scientists hope to determine
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s atmospheric pressures, temperatures and chemical makeup;
whether ring arcs are made of dust, sand, pebbles or boulders; and
how material is distributed inside <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>.
   After the encounter, Voyager II like its sister craft will
continue on its way out of the solar system. It will continue to
send data back to earth until its fuel runs out in 28 years.

   The <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> spacecraft makes a
rendezvous with Earth on <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, using the planet's gravity like
a slingshot to hurl it along on its six-year journey to the solar
system's largest planet, <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>.
   Launched in <DATE>October 1989</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will swoop about 593 miles
above the southwest <LOCATION>Atlantic Ocean</LOCATION> at <TIME>12:35 p.m. PST</TIME>.
   The pass will be monitored by mission controllers at the

Earth's ozone layer, scientists said.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will also be the first spacecraft with modern
instruments to study the far side of the moon, which always faces
away from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   On <DATE>Oct. 18, 1989</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> was released from the cargo bay of

<TEXT>
   Here are key facts about the <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>
spacecraft, which is scheduled to go into orbit around <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> in
<DATE>August</DATE>:
   PRIMARY MISSION: To use radar to penetrate the clouds of Venus
and make pictures and maps of <PERCENT>70 percent</PERCENT> to <PERCENT>90 percent</PERCENT> of the
planet's surface with 10 times better detail than any previous
images. <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> will reveal signs of forces that shaped the
planet, including volcanism, meteorite impacts and possibly wind,
water and large-scale movements of the planet's crust.
   EXTENDED MISSION: A single Venusian day _ the time it takes the
planet to rotate once on its axis _ lasts 243 Earth days.
<ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s primary mission is to map the planet as it rotates once
below the polar-orbiting spacecraft. But <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> scientists expect to
obtain approval for additional 243-day mapping cycles so they can
make pictures and maps of most of the surface. The primary mission
will miss the planet's southernmost latitudes.
   COST: <MONEY>$744 million</MONEY> through the end of <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s primary 243-day
mapping effort, including <MONEY>$413 million</MONEY> for the spacecraft and its
instruments. <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> cut costs by building <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> using some spare
parts from <LOCATION>Voyager</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> spacecraft.
   LAUNCH: Deployed from cargo bay of space shuttle Atlantis on <DATE>May
4, 1989</DATE>, then launched by an inertial upper stage booster.
   THE VOYAGE: A 806 million-mile trip to <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> in 15 months,
requiring 1{ loops around the sun.
   PROPULSION: A solid-fueled Star 48B rocket is to put <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>
into orbit around <LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION> on <DATE>Aug. 10</DATE>. Twenty-four liquid-fueled
thrusters help point the spacecraft and adjust its trajectory.
   ORBIT: <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> will orbit near <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' poles once every 3 hours
and 11 minutes, at an altitude ranging from 171 miles to almost
5,000 miles.
   VITAL STATISTICS: <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> is 21 feet long and 15 feet in
diameter, and weighs 7,410 pounds.
   INSTRUMENTS: Synthetic aperture radar is to send radar waves and
catch the reflected waves to make two-dimensional pictures of
<LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION>, measure elevations for topographic maps, and determine heat
emissions from <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' surface to provide clues about surface
roughness and rock composition. Engineers on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> will precisely
track <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s speed to measure changes in the strength of the
gravity field on various parts of Venus. That will yield clues
about the planet's interior.
   POWER SUPPLY: A pair of solar panels charge the spacecraft's two
nickel-cadmium batteries.
   COMMUNICATIONS: <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s 12-foot antenna dish radios
information back to 230-foot, dish-shaped antennas in <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Goldstone</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif</LOCATION>. The radar information will be
relayed to <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in <LOCATION>Pasadena</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>,
where it will be assembled into maps and pictures.
   CONSTRUCTION: <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory managed the
project. <ORGANIZATION>Martin Marietta Corp.</ORGANIZATION> built the spacecraft in <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Hughes Aircraft Co.</ORGANIZATION> built the radar in <LOCATION>El Segundo</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif</LOCATION>.

   Engineers will prepare the probe for shipment to the <ORGANIZATION>Kennedy
Space Center</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>April</DATE>, followed the next month by the mother ship,
or <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> orbiter. After the two are attached, the combined
spacecraft will be mounted on a solid fuel booster rocket and placed
aboard the shuttle Atlantis.
   The launch is expected to take place between <DATE>Oct. 12</DATE> and about
<DATE>Nov. 21</DATE>.
   After exploring two asteroids, the orbiter and probe will reach
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>December 1995</DATE>, after separating 150 days earlier. The
probe will enter <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s atmosphere at 115,000 mph, then deploy a
parachute as it falls about 370 miles through the planet's
atmosphere.
   The probe will collect and relay information for up to 75 minutes
before it is crushed by <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s tremendous atmospheric pressure.
   The orbiter will circle <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> for at least 20 months, studying
the planet and its surrounding moons, magnetic field and
electrically charged particles.
   The data will help scientists better understand the origin of
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, the solar system and the universe, said <PERSON>Richard Young</PERSON>,
<ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> probe project scientist at <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Ames Research Center</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Mountain View</LOCATION>.
   Galileo had been scheduled to be launched from a space shuttle in
<DATE>May 1986</DATE> and powered out of orbit atop a Centaur booster for a
three-year trip to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, the solar system's largest planet and
the fifth from the sun.
   Then Challenger blew up on <DATE>Jan. 28, 1986</DATE>, killing seven crew
members and grounding the shuttle fleet until last <DATE>fall</DATE>. After the
tragedy, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> decided it was too dangerous to carry liquid-fueled
Centaurs aboard the shuttle.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s route to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> was drastically redesigned and
lengthened because <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> are no longer aligned as
ideally as they were in <DATE>1986</DATE> and because the new booster is less
powerful.
   Because of the launch delay and the longer flight time, the probe
was taken apart for refurbishing and to make sure some parts
wouldn't fail because of aging, and its scientific instruments were
retested.
   On the new flight plan, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will take six years instead of
three years to get to the gaseous, giant planet, traveling 2.4
billion miles although <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> is about 400 million miles from
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Dore</ORGANIZATION> said. To gain energy for the trip, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will use the
gravity of Venus and <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> in a slingshot effect.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will swing toward <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> in <DATE>February 1990</DATE>, swing back
toward Earth that <DATE>December</DATE>, circle the sun, and swing around <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>
again in <DATE>December 1992</DATE> before finally heading for <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>.
   The delay increased the probe's cost to <MONEY>$157 million</MONEY> from <MONEY>$133
million</MONEY>, said <PERSON>Benny Chin</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> probe project manager at
<ORGANIZATION>NASA-Ames</ORGANIZATION>. Total cost of the mission, from its official start in
<DATE>1977</DATE> through completion in late <DATE>1997</DATE> is about <MONEY>$1.36 billion</MONEY>, said
<PERSON>Richard Spehalski</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> project manager at <ORGANIZATION>JPL</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>Spehalski</PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> approval for the launch is expected in
<DATE>September</DATE>. Such approval is needed because the probe and orbiter
each carry a power plant and heater containing radioactive
plutonium. A <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> environmental impact statement concluded last
month that the risk of a nuclear accident when the shuttle lifts off
with <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> is very small.

<TEXT>
   Space shuttle Atlantis soared into
orbit <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> and its astronauts started the <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> probe on a
six-year, roundabout journey to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> for the closest look yet at
the colossus of the solar system.
   ``<ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> is on its way to another world; it's in the hands of
the best flight controllers in this world,'' said Atlantis
commander <PERSON>Don Williams</PERSON>.
   Earlier, concerns about <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s nuclear power supply were left
behind as Atlantis lifted off flawlessly on its mission to carry
the <MONEY>$1.5 billion</MONEY> space probe into orbit on the first leg of its
trip.
   After Atlantis had made five trips around the world, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> was
ejected from the cargo bay by springs at <TIME>7:15 p.m. EDT</TIME>, precisely
on schedule, over the <LOCATION>Gulf of Mexico</LOCATION> east of <LOCATION>Brownsville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Tex</LOCATION>. The
shuttle quickly moved away to put distance between itself and the
space probe's rocket.
   The ``burn'' was an hour later over <LOCATION>Borneo</LOCATION> _ first for 2{
minutes, then for a minute, 45 seconds _ giving the 6,700-pound
<ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> the initial push toward <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>, its first planetary
port-of-call.
   ``On time and on schedule,'' said <ORGANIZATION>Mission Control</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``It achieved earth-escape velocity and is now heading outbound
toward the sun,'' said <PERSON>Brian Welch</PERSON>, spokesman for <ORGANIZATION>Johnson Space
Center</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION>. A spacecraft can escape the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s gravity when
traveling faster than 25,000 mph.
   The five astronauts spent their first hours in space giving a
final electronic checkout to <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>, a probe so sophisticated that
one <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> official dubbed it ``the <ORGANIZATION>Rolls-Royce</ORGANIZATION> of spacecraft.''
   ``Everything looks real good,'' said astronaut <PERSON>Shannon Lucid</PERSON>, a
one-flight veteran from <LOCATION>Bethany</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Okla.</LOCATION>, who had charge of the probe
deployment.
   The crew members reported a few problems with their own ship as
it orbited 184 miles above the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. One was with a cooling system
that might cause them to have to return slightly earlier than
planned in what a flight director called ``a worst-case scenario.''
   ``You looked marvelous going up,'' Mission Control told <PERSON>Williams</PERSON>
as the winged spacecraft reached orbit after two launch
postponements.
   ``I feel a lot better,'' said <PERSON>Williams</PERSON>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>, named after the 17th century discoverer of <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s
moons, will use the laws of physics to get to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, the largest
planet in the solar system, in <DATE>1995</DATE>. Flying by <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> will cause it
to gain momentum and so will two subsequent close encounters with
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   Although concern over the <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s 49.4-pound plutonium power
supply was argued in court, it drew no protesters to the <ORGANIZATION>Kennedy
Space Center</ORGANIZATION> on launch day. Environmentalists had argued that a
Challenger-like accident could scatter deadly plutonium-238 over
<LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>.
   Nothing like that happened <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, and even the weather
cooperated. Clouds and rain threatened to halt the launch until the
last minutes of the countdown, but the clouds suddenly dissipated
and the shuttle darted into a bright blue sky, trailing a 700-foot
geyser of fire.
   The 132-ton Atlantis has a crew of five for the mission that
ends <DATE>Monday</DATE> with a landing at <ORGANIZATION>Edwards Air Force Base</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>
at <TIME>2:38 p.m. EDT</TIME>.
   The <MONEY>$1.5 billion</MONEY> mission already was seven years behind schedule
when Atlantis was grounded by rain at the last minute <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> and
by a faulty engine computer last week.
   ``It feels great,'' said <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> chief scientist <PERSON>Lennard Fisk</PERSON> after
liftoff. ``It's been a long time.''
   Apart from <ORGANIZATION>Lucid</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Williams</PERSON>' crew consists of pilot <PERSON>Mike McCulley</PERSON>
and mission specialists <PERSON>Ellen Baker</PERSON> and <PERSON>Franklin Chang-Diaz</PERSON>.
   The liftoff was the start of a voyage that will take the probe
on a looping path past <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> in <DATE>February</DATE>, back to within 620 miles
of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> in <DATE>December 1990</DATE> and past <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> again at a 200-mile
altitude <DATE>two years later</DATE>. The craft will arrive at <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in
<DATE>Deceber 1995</DATE> for a two-year orbit.
   As part of the mission, a robot will separate from the <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>
spacecraft and plunge through <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s gaseous atmosphere.
   Scientists hope to gain insight into the birth of the solar
system by studying <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, which holds original material from that
event 14 billion years ago. The planet's diameter is about 11 times
that of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and its mass 318 times greater.
   The mission originally was to have started in <DATE>1982</DATE>, but money
ran out. Then came the Challenger explosion in <DATE>January 1986</DATE>,
delaying all shuttle flights for three years and prompting a change
in the rocket to propel the <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>.
   The mission originally was budgeted at <MONEY>$425 million</MONEY>. It will
climb to <MONEY>$1.9 billion</MONEY> by the time <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> finishes a 10-orbit trip
around <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1997</DATE>.
   The sweeps past <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> will take advantage of the
planets' gravity to accelerate the spacecraft to the proper speed
to reach its distant target. Small onboard motors will fine-tune
the flight path.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s electricity will be generated by decaying
radioactive pellets of plutonium-238, which causes cancer and death
in humans if inhaled in minuscule amounts.
   Environmental activists feared not only a launch accident but
also mishaps during the two flybys. <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> convinced a federal judge
that the plutonium containers could withstand such pressures and
that even if there were a release of radioactivity there would be
no appreciable health effects.
   The government had hundreds of experts in the launch area _ just
in case _ to monitor any radioactive release.
   More than 200 guards on foot, in helicopters and boats patrolled
the launch center for protesters who said they might try to stop
the launch by infiltrating the launch zone and sitting on the
launch pad.
   ``We've succeeded in a small way calling attention to the
escalating plan to put nuclear energy into space, including in Star
Wars,'' said <PERSON>Bruce Gagnon</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Florida Coalition for Peace and
Justice</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``The real fundamental point is that people haven't been doing
much more than ooo-ing and ahhh-ing at the launches. They haven't
been considering the moral and ethical issues of what is in these
things, where they are going and what they are doing.''

   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s camera shutter snapped
uncontrollably for five hours <DATE>Saturday</DATE> after the spacecraft zipped
around <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>, but officials said it shouldn't endanger the <MONEY>$1.35
billion</MONEY>, eight-year mission to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>.
   Engineers at <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory shut off the
television camera while diagnosing the problem, which apparently
involved faulty software that made <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s computer send
incorrect commands to the camera, mission director <PERSON>Neal Ausman</PERSON> said.
   They decided <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> to send new computer commands to
<ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> to restart the camera so it could take a series of
photographs of Venus late <DATE>Saturday</DATE> and early <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, said <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>
spokesman <PERSON>Bob MacMillin</PERSON>.
   The engineers believed an error in computer commands they sent
to <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> made the shutter snap when it wasn't supposed to, and
they were ``pretty certain there's nothing wrong with the computer
or camera,'' he said.
   Galileo cruised around Venus at <TIME>9:59 p.m. PST</TIME> <DATE>Friday</DATE>, coming
three to four miles closer to the planet than the planned point of
closest approach 10,028 miles above the Venusian surface, said
mission science and design manager <PERSON>Bill O'Neil</PERSON>.
   The camera appeared undamaged, but its shutter opened and closed
twice per minute 468 times over five hours, <PERSON>Ausman</PERSON> said. As
planned, only 16 pictures taken late <DATE>Friday</DATE> and early <DATE>Saturday</DATE> were
stored on <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s tape recorder, <PERSON>Ausman</PERSON> said.
   The malfunction didn't harm those pictures, and the 452 unwanted
shutter snappings were ``just like taking pictures with no film in
the camera,'' project manager <PERSON>Dick Spehalski</PERSON> said during a <DATE>Saturday</DATE>
news conference.
   However, the problem threatened five dozen other photos the
spacecraft was supposed to take in the coming week to make a
time-lapse movie of Venus' clouds and winds, said project scientist
<PERSON>Torrence Johnson</PERSON>.
   He said scientists weren't too upset because about 20 <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and
Soviet spacecraft have visited Venus previously, and the main
purpose of <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s flyby was to use <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' gravity to speed the
spacecraft for its long trip to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s other sensors will continue observing <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> as the
spacecraft speeds away from the planet, <PERSON>Spehalski</PERSON> said.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> was deployed <DATE>Oct. 18</DATE> from space shuttle Atlantis on a
looping 2.4-billion, six-year route that requires <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> and Earth
to be used as gravity slingshots to hurl the spacecraft to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>.
   Once there, the spacecraft will deploy a probe to study
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s atmosphere, then orbit the giant gas planet for at least
two years in a mission that costs <MONEY>$1.35 billion</MONEY>.
   When the glitch developed at <TIME>1:41 a.m. PST</TIME> <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>
already had snapped the 16 pictures to study Venusian wind and
cloud patterns and search for lightning that might indicate
erupting volcanoes beneath the clouds.
   The camera was shut off at <TIME>6:30 a.m.</TIME> after engineers determined
it was following incorrect computer commands, <PERSON>Ausman</PERSON> said. Eight
minutes later the erroneous commands stopped without explanation.
   Despite the trouble, ``there was no point when the spacecraft
was in jeopardy,'' he said.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s TV camera is perhaps the most critical instrument on
the spacecraft. It is expected to take pictures of <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> 20 to
1,000 times more detailed than those returned by the Voyager 1 and
2 spacecraft in <DATE>1979</DATE>.
   The TV camera has a shutter, which opens to throw light on an
electronic sensor. Data from that sensor can be sent to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>,
where it is assembled into a photograph.
   ``We're dealing with a fresh spacecraft and prototype
software,'' so <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> knowingly risked a glitch in exchange for
trying to photograph Venus even though the spacecraft is still in
the shakedown part of its trip to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> said.
   For now, the pictures and data gathered in the flyby are being
stored on <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s tape recorder, and won't be sent back to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>
until <DATE>October</DATE> when the spacecraft is close enough to transmit the
material. That antenna now can be used only for communications to
keep <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> operating.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s roundabout route to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> is an indirect result of
the <DATE>1986</DATE> explosion that destroyed the shuttle Challenger and killed
seven crew members.
   After the tragedy, the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space
Administration</ORGANIZATION> decided against using powerful, volatile,
liquid-fueled Centaur rockets to launch spacecraft after they were
deployed from shuttles.
   Instead, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> was launched by a weaker booster after it was
released from Atlantis' cargo bay. That made it necessary to use
the gravity of Venus and Earth to help speed and aim <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> toward
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>. A <ORGANIZATION>Centaur</ORGANIZATION> would have propelled <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> to Venus in only
two years.

<HEAD>Galileo Sensors Checked After Course Correction</HEAD>

<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> has started testing sensors aboard
<ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>, five days after the spacecraft successfully fired its
thrusters for a second course correction on its journey to <LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION>
and <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``We're testing all of the scientific instruments to ensure they
are ready to observe Venus'' when <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> whizzes past the
cloud-shrouded planet <DATE>Feb. 9</DATE>, said <PERSON>Jim Wilson</PERSON>, spokesman for the
<ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
   On <DATE>Friday</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> fired its thrusters during a 2{-hour period
so that it will fly about 6,200 miles above the Venusian cloudtops,
<PERSON>Wilson</PERSON> said.
   ``The maneuver went off exactly as planned,'' <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> mission
director <PERSON>Neal Ausman</PERSON> said.
   <PERSON>Wilson</PERSON> said another maneuver may be needed in late <DATE>January</DATE> to
fine-tune the spacecraft's trajectory. The first trajectory
maneuver was performed in <DATE>November</DATE>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> was launched from the space shuttle Atlantis on <DATE>Oct. 18</DATE>.
It will swoop by <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> once and Earth twice so those planets can
act as ``gravity slingshots'' to propel <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> toward its <DATE>1995</DATE>
encounter with <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, the solar system's largest planet.
   On <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, the spacecraft was 12{ million miles from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>,
but had traveled almost 105 million miles along its looping
185-million-mile path to <LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Wilson</PERSON> said.
   The spacecraft still has 2.3 billion miles left out of its
2.4-billion-mile trip to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>.
   After flying past <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> in <DATE>December 1990</DATE> and <DATE>December 1992</DATE>,
<ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will separate into an orbiter and a probe in <DATE>July 1995</DATE>.
   The orbiter will circle the giant gas planet for 22 months
starting in <DATE>December 1995</DATE>, the same month the probe will parachute
into the Jovian atmosphere, collecting information for 75 minutes
until it is crushed by overwhelming atmospheric pressure.
   Scientific information that <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> collects during <DATE>February</DATE>'s
Venus flyby won't be transmitted back to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> until late <DATE>October</DATE>,
after the spacecraft unfurls its umbrella-shaped, high-gain
antenna, <PERSON>Wilson</PERSON> said.
   The antenna would be damaged by heat if it were as deployed near
<LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION>, the second planet from the sun, he added.

A federal judge <DATE>Friday</DATE> cleared the way for the launching of the space shuttle 
Discovery early today after ruling that three environmental groups had failed 
to demonstrate that the launching could result in radioactive contamination 
over much of the <LOCATION>East Coast</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The Discovery, scheduled for liftoff at <TIME>4:35 a.m. PDT</TIME>, will carry the 
nuclear-powered Ulysses into orbit and then send the robotic spacecraft on a 
2-billion-mile journey to the sun by way of <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>. During its five-year 
mission, the craft will generate electricity for its instruments by tapping 
into the energy released by the radioactive decay of 24 pounds of plutonium 
238. 
</P>
<P>
Protesters had argued that a cataclysmic accident could release the plutonium 
into the atmosphere, and they asked <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> District <PERSON>Judge Oliver Gasch</PERSON> in 
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> to delay the launching for at least a year. 
</P>
<P>
In arguing for the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Justice 
Department</ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON>Rebecca Donnellan</PERSON> said that such a postponement would cost 
<MONEY>$350 million</MONEY>. <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> has insisted that only nuclear power can supply the 
electricity the Ulysses probe will need when it travels through the dim light 
of the outer solar system, but critics insist that even <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s own documents 
show that a solar-powered craft, launched atop a Titan-Centaur unmanned rocket, 
could have done the job without the radioactive power supply. 
</P>
<P>
With the court victory behind them, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> officials looked forward to today's 
launching and hoped for good weather. The weather was expected to be 
acceptable, but there was a <PERCENT>40%</PERCENT> chance that showers would force another delay. 
</P>
<P>
Six hours after liftoff, the five-man crew of the Discovery will deploy the 
<LOCATION>Ulysses</LOCATION>, built by the <ORGANIZATION>European Space Agency</ORGANIZATION>. The Ulysses will give scientists 
their first look ever at the poles of the sun and thus could help them 
understand such things as changes in solar temperatures that have a major 
impact on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
But to go into a polar orbit around the sun, <PERSON>Ulysses</PERSON> must first fly to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, 
five times farther from the sun than is the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. It will pass over <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> 
close enough for the planet to fling the spacecraft down and into a huge orbit 
that will carry it over the poles of the sun. 
</P>
<P>
No one has ever seen the poles of the sun because the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and the other 
planets orbit around the sun's Equator. That incomplete picture has left 
scientists guessing about how the poles influence such things as sunspots and 
solar flares, which in turn are thought to have an impact on weather patterns 
on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The Discovery's commander is <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> Capt. <PERSON>Richard N. Richards</PERSON>, 44, and the pilot 
is Marine Lt. Col. <PERSON>Robert D. Cabana</PERSON>, 41. Mission specialists are <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> Maj. 
<PERSON>Thomas D. Akers</PERSON>, 39, and <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> Capt. <PERSON>William M. Shepherd</PERSON>, 41. The fifth member 
of the all-military crew is the first <ORGANIZATION>Coast Guardsman</ORGANIZATION> to fly in space, Cmdr. 
<PERSON>Bruce Melnick</PERSON>, 40, a mission specialist. 
</P>
<P>
The flight is scheduled to end four days after launching with a landing at 
<ORGANIZATION>Edwards Air Force Base</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Calif</LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
   More than 450 years after the church tried
<ORGANIZATION>Galileo Galilei</ORGANIZATION> for heresy, Pope <PERSON>John Paul II</PERSON> came to the
astronomer's hometown and pronounced the words many Pisans have
longed to hear:
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> was right and the church was wrong.
   The pope had previously said the Inquisition erred in condemning
<ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> for teaching that the earth revolves around the sun. But
his statements during a weekend trip to this Tuscan city were
viewed by its citizens as <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s official rehabilitation.
   Speaking <DATE>Sunday</DATE> at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Pisa</ORGANIZATION>, where <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> studied
and taught in the late 1500s, <PERSON>John Paul</PERSON> said he wanted to recall
some of the school's illustrious alumni _ ``above all the very
great <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>.''
   Shortly after his arrival in <LOCATION>Pisa</LOCATION> on <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>, the pope
stood on a bridge over the <LOCATION>Arno River</LOCATION>, illuminated by flickering
candles, and declared:
   ``How can one not recall the name of that great man who was born
here and from here took the first steps toward immortal fame?
   ``<ORGANIZATION>Galileo Galilei</ORGANIZATION>, whose scientific work, imprudently opposed at
the beginning, is now recognized by all as an essential step in the
methodology of research and, in general, on the path toward the
knowledge of the world of nature.''
   Born in <DATE>1564</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> originally aroused antagonism when, as a
professor at the university from <DATE>1589</DATE> to <DATE>1592</DATE>, he initiated
experiments on the laws of bodies in motion which contradicted the
accepted teachings of Aristotle.
   But he was most widely known for his support of the Copernicus
system, which taught that the sun is the central body and the earth
and the other planets revolve around it.
   That defied the church-held belief that the earth was the center
of the universe.
   In <DATE>1616</DATE>, the church denounced the Copernicus system as dangerous
to faith, summoned <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> to <LOCATION>Rome</LOCATION> and warned him not to uphold or
teach it.
   But he published a book supporting the theory in <DATE>1632</DATE>. The next
year he was summoned to <LOCATION>Rome</LOCATION>, tried by the Inquisition and forced
to abjure his beliefs. <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> was sentenced to life imprisonment,
which was later changed to house arrest. He died in <DATE>1642</DATE> near
<LOCATION>Florence</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>John Paul</PERSON> has often spoken out on <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s behalf.
   In <DATE>1979</DATE>, less than a year after his election as pope, he urged
the international scientific community to examine the <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> case,
saying he hoped it would help remove the ``diffidence that still
prevents fruitful harmony between science and faith, and between
the church and the world.''
   <PERSON>John Paul</PERSON> appointed a <ORGANIZATION>Vatican</ORGANIZATION> commission in <DATE>1979</DATE> to study the
case. Five years later, the <ORGANIZATION>Pontifical Academy of Sciences</ORGANIZATION> issued
documents from secret <ORGANIZATION>Vatican</ORGANIZATION> archives, including details of the
Inquisition proceedings, which uphold <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>.
   In his speech at the university on <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, the pope did not
address the <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> case specifically. But he noted that religious
faith and science have often been at odds throughout the centuries.
   <PERSON>John Paul</PERSON> warned of potential moral and ethical abuses of modern
science but said faith and research are not incompatible.
   ``The church trusts, promotes and encourages your task,'' he
said.

   A healthy <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> spacecraft sped
unerringly toward distant <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, while the five
orbiting astronauts who released it measured the threatened ozone
layer that is <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s natural sunscreen.
   Racing along at more than 9,000 mph, the probe <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>
was more than 260,000 miles out on its 2.4-billion-mile, six-year
journey to study the largest planet in the solar system in a search
for clues to how the universe began.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> was dispatched from <ORGANIZATION>Atlantis</ORGANIZATION>' cargo bay <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>,
6{ hours after the shuttle was launched from <LOCATION>Cape Canaveral</LOCATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION> officials reported
<DATE>Thursday</DATE> the craft was in ``perfect shape'' and ``right on course.''
   Atlantis also was pronounced in ``excellent condition'' by
<ORGANIZATION>Mission Control</ORGANIZATION> after the crew members successfully restored a
cooling system that shut down <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> when it overheated and cut
in a backup unit.
   On <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, a major solar flare hurled a surge of radiation
toward Earth, but <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> officials said they were not concerned.
   Government scientists said the flare may disrupt communications
and electrical power transmission over the <DATE>next two days</DATE>, but <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>
said it had been evaluated and was not considered a problem for the
astronauts.
   ``In the orbit we're in, at 160-mile altitude, it is no threat
at all,'' said flight director <PERSON>Ronald D. Dittemore</PERSON>.
   The burst also has had no impact on <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>, which is ``built
for much harsher environments than a solar flare,'' said <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>
spokeswoman Paula Cleggett-Haleim.
   Earlier <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Mission Control</ORGANIZATION> wakened the space travelers
with a musical tribute to Atlantis commander <PERSON>Don Williams</PERSON> and pilot
<PERSON>Mike McCulley</PERSON>, both naval aviators and graduates of <ORGANIZATION>Purdue
University</ORGANIZATION>.
   Played were ``Hail Purdue'' and ``Anchors Aweigh,'' with
reveille sandwiched in between.
   The other crew members are <PERSON>Ellen Baker</PERSON>, <PERSON>Franklin Chang-Diaz</PERSON> and
<PERSON>Shannon Lucid</PERSON>.
   They began a series of medical, materials processing and other
experiments that will occupy their time until they return to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>
on <DATE>Monday</DATE>. Landing is scheduled for <ORGANIZATION>Edwards Air Force Base</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>,
at <TIME>2:38 p.m. EDT</TIME> <DATE>Monday</DATE>.
   On <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> satellite television <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>, <PERSON>Chang-Diaz</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mrs.
Baker</PERSON> demonstrated a retinal photography test on the shuttle's
middeck.
   With swimming goggles strapped around her head, <PERSON>Mrs. Baker</PERSON>
steadied herself while <PERSON>Chang-Diaz</PERSON> pressed a camera to the right
goggle to photograph her retina.
   Researchers said the camera slides should help them determine if
there are any changes in the eye's vessels in zero gravity. Such
changes could indicate some brain swelling, and researchers want to
determine if that is related to motion sickness in space.
   A new shuttle experiment used a sensitive instrument in the
cargo bay to measure sections of the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s ozone layer, an area
of the upper atmosphere that protects our planet from most of the
sun's ultraviolet radiation.
   There is global concern over depletion of the ozone layer, and
many people fear its destruction will cause a rise in such human
health problems as skin cancer.
   The information gathered by the Atlantis crew will be compared
with data being collected at the same time and over the same areas
by nearly identical sensors aboard three older <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> satellites.
   Researchers want the new data so they can accurately calibrate
the satellite sensors. <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> considers the experiment so important
that it has scheduled it for six more shuttle flights.
   ``Accurate, reliable measurements from space are critical to the
detection of ozone trends and for assessing the potential effects
and development of corrective measures,'' the agency said.
   Scientists report the ozone shield has thinned out worldwide by
about <PERCENT>3 percent</PERCENT> within the <DATE>last two decades</DATE>, with the largest
losses occurring over the polar regions.
   The depletion is thought to be increased by the interaction of
certain manmade chemicals, principally chlorofluorocarbons, or
CFCs, used as refrigerants and in the manufacturing of some plastic
products.
   Some <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> manufacturers and users of CFCs have announced plans
to stop making the chemical or to guard against releasing it into
the atmosphere.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>, which slowed from its initial earth-escape velocity of
more than 25,000 mph, has a long way to go on its odyssey that will
take it on a scenic route through the solar system. Its path will
whip it once past <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>, twice around the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and within view of
an asteroid before it reaches <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>December 1995</DATE>.
   The roundabout route is necessary for the 6,000-pound spacecraft
to use the gravity forces of Venus and Earth to gain enough speed
to reach its target.
   Once at <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will fire a probe into the Jovian
atmosphere and then orbit the planet for a planned 22-month study.
   Scientists believe the probe could reveal much about the birth
of the universe.
   Because <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> has apparently undergone little change from its
beginnings, its composition is thought to resemble the cloud of gas
and dust from which the sun and planets formed. <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s
observations could give scientists a better idea of what the early
solar system looked like when it formed 4.6 billion years ago.
   Similarly, the Jovian atmosphere's hydrogen-to-helium ratio
promises to be a vital clue to the validity of the big-bang theory,
which holds that the universe was created in a single explosive
moment more than 15 billion years ago. The ratio is thought to be
about the same as was created at the time of the big bang.

   The robot probe <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> streaked
across the solar system today at 25,000 mph on its way to <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>,
and the astronauts who launched the spacecraft turned to more
routine tasks aboard Atlantis.
   Deployment of the probe from the shuttle's cargo bay <DATE>Thursday</DATE>
<TIME>night</TIME> signaled a revival of an American planetary-science program
that has been dormant since <DATE>1978</DATE>.
   ``The spacecraft is performing just beautifully. All systems are
operational and nominal. It couldn't be better,'' <PERSON>John Gerpheide</PERSON>,
<ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> project manager, said a few hours after the probe was
launched.
   Atlantis' fiery blastoff <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME> followed a
cliff-hanging, 59-minute wait that ground controllers and the five
astronauts endured because of the fickle <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> weather. With just
five minutes left in the shuttle's launch window, controllers found
a hole in the clouds and Atlantis thundered into the sky at <TIME>2:47
p.m. EDT</TIME>.
   About six hours after the liftoff, <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> was gently ejected
from the shuttle's cargo bay and the <MONEY>$550-million</MONEY> interplanetary
mission began.
   ``At last check, all systems were working exceptionally well on
<ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>,'' Mission Control commentator <PERSON>Jeffrey Carr</PERSON> said <DATE>early
today</DATE>.
   The space shuttle also was performing well, <PERSON>Carr</PERSON> said.
   Mission Control awoke the crew today at about <TIME>9:20 a.m. EDT</TIME> with
a rousing rendition of the theme music from the movie ``Superman.''
   ``Good-morning and congratulations on a super day yesterday,''
Mission Control told the crew.
   ``Good morning <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION>,'' commander <PERSON>David Walker</PERSON> replied.
``We're up and around. Everybody's feeling good, trying to find our
toothbrushes.
   ``We thank you for that fine wake-up music,'' <PERSON>Walker</PERSON> said.
   During the rest of the mission, the astronauts will try to
photograph lightning systems at night and attempt to grow crystals
of indium by melting and then re-solidying the material.
   The crew members also will take other photographs of the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>
as well as test various systems on the orbiter. Another planned
project includes taking saliva samples during the flight to
determine how an anti-motion sickness drug is absorbed by the body
in zero gravity.
   Atlantis, in orbit 184 miles above the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, is scheduled to
land <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME> at <ORGANIZATION>Edwards Air Force Base</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Calif</LOCATION>.
   ``It was really a wonderful day for us, the beginning of the
rebirth of the planetary program,'' <PERSON>Gerpheide</PERSON> said. ``It's the
beginning of a really grand set of missions which will last for
quite a few years.''
   ``While it's too early to tell about the major portion of
<ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s mission, we're pleased it's gone so well so far,''
<PERSON>Walker</PERSON> said when told <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> had been launched on its journey.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> was the first planetary craft deployed from a space
shuttle.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> is moving at a rate of 25,000 mph, relative to
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, meaning it travels about 416 miles in just sixty seconds. At
its current rate, <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> could get from <LOCATION>Washington D.C.</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>New
York</LOCATION> in a minute and could fly coast-to-coast in about seven
minutes.
   But it will take the spacecraft 15 months to travel to <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>,
the cloud-shrouded planet that is 158 million miles away. The probe
will loop 1{ times around the sun and travel 806 million miles
before reaching its destination in <DATE>August 1990</DATE>.
   Once in orbit above <LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> is to use its radar system
to map up to <PERCENT>90 percent</PERCENT> of the planet's surface. The
high-resolution radar is expected to produce images of objects as
small as a football field _ 10 times the clarity of any previous
pictures of Venus.
   Venus, where the surface temperature is 900 degrees, has long
intrigued scientists because it is close in size to the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> but
so different in many other ways. The sun rises in the west because
<PERSON>Venus</PERSON> rotates the opposite direction of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, and its rotation is
so slow that a day there lasts 243 Earth days.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>, named for the 16th-century Portuguese explorer, needed
to be launched by <DATE>May 28</DATE> or it would have had to wait two years for
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and Venus to again be in a favorable alignment.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> had tried to launch <LOCATION>Atlantis</LOCATION> <DATE>last Friday</DATE>, but a flaw
detected in a fuel pump halted the liftoff. Engineers later found
what appeared to be a leak in a hydrogen fuel line, and both parts
were replaced before <DATE>Thursday</DATE>'s launch.
   Crew members on the mission, the 29th shuttle flight and the
fourth since the Challenger disaster, are <PERSON>Walker</PERSON>, pilot <PERSON>Ronald
Grabe</PERSON>, and mission specialists <PERSON>Norman Thagard</PERSON>, <PERSON>Mary Cleave</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mark
Lee</PERSON>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s mission marks the beginning of a new era in solar
system exploration that has been dormant since <DATE>1978</DATE> when the
Pioneer-Venus spacecraft was launched.
   In <DATE>October</DATE>, another Atlantis crew is to start the <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> probe
on its way to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Hubble Space Telescope</ORGANIZATION> is scheduled for
launch from a shuttle early next year, <PERSON>Ulysses</PERSON> is to orbit the sun
in <DATE>October 1990</DATE> and the Mars Observer spacecraft will be dispatched
in <DATE>1992</DATE> on an unmanned rocket.

   Atlantis' astronauts, safely in
orbit after a cliff-hanger weather delay, sent the <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>
spacecraft streaking across the solar system <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> on a
<MONEY>$550 million</MONEY> mapmaking mission to <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>.
   The robot spacecraft, reviving an American planetary-science
program dormant for a decade, slipped from the shuttle's cargo bay
at <TIME>9:01 p.m. EDT</TIME> and drifted into space.
   ``Magellan is deployed,'' reported shuttle commander <PERSON>David
Walker</PERSON>.
   An hour later, after Atlantis moved a safe distance away, both
stages of a spacecraft motor fired to start <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> on a 456-day
journey to <LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION>, 158 million miles away. It will travel 806
million miles, looping 1{ times around the sun, before reaching and
orbiting its target in <DATE>August 1990</DATE>.
   ``While it's too early to tell about the major portion of
<ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s mission, we're pleased it's gone so well so far,''
<PERSON>Walker</PERSON> replied when told both stages had fired.
   Minutes later <ORGANIZATION>Mission Control</ORGANIZATION> reported:
   ``<ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> is coming to life and is on a proper path toward
<PERSON>Venus</PERSON>, falling toward the sun.''
   Mission specialists <PERSON>Mark Lee</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mary Cleave</PERSON>, operating remote
controls inside the shuttle cabin, checked the health of the space
probe before sending a signal that spring-ejected it into its own
orbit while Atlantis soared over the <LOCATION>Pacific Ocean</LOCATION> 600 miles
southwest of <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>, the first planetary craft ever launched from a
shuttle, is to map up to <PERCENT>90 percent</PERCENT> of <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' cloud-shrouded
surface. Its high-resolution radar system is expected to produce
images of objects as small as a football field _ 10 times the
clarity of any previous pictures of the mysterious planet.
   The release of <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>, the main task of the four-day flight,
came a little more than six hours after Atlantis thundered into
orbit 184 miles high.
   The launch was delayed 59 minutes by shifting clouds and winds
that had threatened the second postponement in six days. When
Atlantis finally left its pad, just five minutes remained in the
launch ``window'' dictated by the need to have the shuttle in the
proper position to dispatch <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> to <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>.
   The launch team had advanced the countdown to the 5-minute mark
and held there, waiting for a break in the clouds that obscured a
runway near the launch pad where Atlantis would land in an
emergency.
   Chief astronaut <PERSON>Dan Brandenstein</PERSON>, flying a weather scout plane,
found a break, signaled the go-ahead, and the count was started and
carried down to the blazing liftoff.
   ``It was another cliff-hanger. I'm glad you stuck with it,''
acting <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> administrator <PERSON>Dale D. Myers</PERSON> said as he congratulated
the launch team.
   It was the 60th <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> man-in-space flight, the 29th for the
shuttle and the fourth since the Challenger explosion more than
three years ago.
   ``Four of us are very happy to be back in space, and the fifth
one is very happy to be here,'' radioed <PERSON>Walker</PERSON>.
   Walker, pilot <PERSON>Ron Grabe</PERSON> and mission specialists Cleave and
<PERSON>Norman Thagard</PERSON> flew on previous shuttle flights. Lee is a rookie.
   ``Did somebody win the pool up there?'' mission control
commentator <PERSON>John Creighton</PERSON> asked the crew. ``We had only five
minutes left in the window.''
   ``We wouldn't want to push it any closer,'' replied <PERSON>Walker</PERSON>.
   The commander also reported Atlantis' separation from its
external fuel tank as it entered orbit was rougher than he
remembered on his first shuttle flight.
   ``It was more violent _ although I hate to use that word,'' he
said. ``It wasn't the soft separation I remembered from the
previous flight.''
   A launch attempt last <DATE>Friday</DATE> was halted with just 31 seconds to
go because of a short circuit in an engine fuel pump. Technicians
worked around the clock over the weekend to replace the pump and a
fuel line. <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> had to launch <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> by <DATE>May 28</DATE> or ground it for
two years until <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> were again in the proper alignment.
   Among tens of thousands who watched the rare afternoon liftoff
were some of the country's most renowned planetary scientists. They
have been waiting to resume solar system exploration since <DATE>1978</DATE>,
when Pioneer-Venus was launched on the last <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> planetary
expedition.
   Success for <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> would signal the start of a science-rich
three-year period during which five major probes will be rocketed
into space.
   ``The overture, the symphony, begins with <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>,'' said <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>
science chief <PERSON>Lennard Fisk</PERSON>. ``It's going to be a long symphony.
It's going to have a lot of crescendos ... Nobody is going to
question our leadership in planetary science again.''
   Fisk hailed <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s flight as the start of a ``second golden
age'' of space science. The first was the period from the mid-1960s
to the late-1970s when unmanned spacecraft for the first time were
launched to make closeup examinations of <LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION>, Mars, <ORGANIZATION>Mercury</ORGANIZATION>,
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> and Uranus.
   Looking ahead, <PERSON>Fisk</PERSON> said that in <DATE>August</DATE> the Voyager 2 spacecraft
launched in <DATE>1977</DATE> will take the first close look at <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> after a
planetary odyssey that earlier took it near <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> and
Uranus.
   In <DATE>October</DATE>, another Atlantis crew is to start the <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> probe
on its way to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Hubble Space Telescope</ORGANIZATION> is scheduled for
launch from a shuttle early next year, <PERSON>Ulysses</PERSON> is to orbit the sun
in <DATE>October 1990</DATE> and the Mars Observer spacecraft will be dispatched
in <DATE>1992</DATE> on an unmanned rocket.
   The planetary program had languished for 11 years because of a
combination of <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> budget cuts and the Challenger explosion that
delayed most of these missions more than three years.
   When <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> reaches <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> in <DATE>August 1990</DATE>, it is to fire into
orbit and start its 243-day mapping assignment.
   ``The goal is to obtain radar images of at least <PERCENT>70 percent</PERCENT> of
the planet,'' said <PERSON>Stephen Saunders</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> project scientist.
   The radar is designed to pierce Venus sulfuric acid clouds and
produce images showing features as small as 100 yards across, the
size of a football field. In comparison, two <DATE>1983</DATE> Soviet spacecraft
captured features about 1,200 yards across and the <DATE>1978</DATE>
Pioneer-Venus could not distinguish anything smaller than 60 miles
across.
   ``Everything we have learned about planetary science says that
<PERSON>Venus</PERSON> is the planet most like <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>,'' <PERSON>Saunders</PERSON> said. ``A major
question is why Earth and Venus evolved so differently even though
at the beginning of the solar system they were almost identical.''
   The surface temperature of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s sultry twin is 900 degrees
Fahrenheit, hot enough to melt lead, and the atmospheric pressure
is 90 times greater than that on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   The atmosphere of Venus is composed mostly of carbon dioxide,
and the upper clouds, which hide the planet from view, are made up
of sulfuric acid droplets. Earlier exploration by unmanned
spacecraft have revealed continent-sized plateaus, deep canyons and
one of the highest mountains in the solar system.
   <PERSON>Saunders</PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> pictures might answer questions about
the extent of volcanic activity and settle disputes over whether
<PERSON>Venus</PERSON> once had oceans of water and whether it has shifting crustal
plates similar to those on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Jupiter-bound <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> spacecraft
will zoom past <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> next week, taking pictures and making
measurements as if its home planet were an alien world.
   ``It will be the first time the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> has been viewed from this
perspective. I expect it will give us a greater appreciation of
this place,'' said <PERSON>Bill O'Neil</PERSON>, project manager at the <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet
Propulsion Laboratory.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s close encounter with <ORGANIZATION>Earth</ORGANIZATION> will take place on <DATE>Dec. 8</DATE>
and is aimed at using the planet's gravity like a slingshot to send
the craft on the right path.
   The craft will swoop about 593 miles above the southwest
<LOCATION>Atlantic Ocean</LOCATION> at <TIME>12:35 p.m. PST</TIME> <DATE>Dec. 8</DATE>. <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> was 3.97 million
miles from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> today.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will be the first planetary craft to approach Earth from
space. So the flyby will be ``our first chance to look at <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> as
we have at other planets,'' <PERSON>Torrence Johnson</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s chief
scientist, said <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   During its flyby, the spacecraft will measure gases that cause
the ``greenhouse effect'' warming of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s atmosphere and will
study high-altitude water vapor that helps create and destroy
Earth's ozone layer, <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> said.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> also will be the first spacecraft with modern
instruments to study the far side of the moon, which is always
pointed away from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, he added.
   Galileo is powered by two nuclear batteries - not reactors -
that use the decay of radioactive plutonium to produce electricity.
   Environmentalists unsuccessfully sued to halt <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s launch
for fear the plutonium could contaminate <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s atmosphere. <PERSON>O'Neil</PERSON>
said the chance that <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will somehow plunge into <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s
atmosphere and release its plutonium is less than one in <MONEY>2 million</MONEY>.
   Even if it did happen, the plutonium would cause no more than 10
cancer deaths during the next 70 years, according to <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>.
   Galileo is the most sophisticated unmanned spacecraft ever
built. It was launched from a space shuttle in <DATE>October 1989</DATE> and is
scheduled to rendezvous with <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1995</DATE> after a looping
2.4-billion-mile journey.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s route was designed so the spacecraft could use Venus
and <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> as ``gravity slingshots.'' It will use Earth for that
purpose <DATE>Dec. 8</DATE> and again in <DATE>December 1992</DATE>.
   It used <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> as a gravity slingshot last <DATE>February</DATE>. Scientists

for Ulysses

<TEXT>
Ulysses, the first spacecraft to break free from the plane of our solar
system, will reach the climax of a 3bn km voyage today when it flies above
the south pole of the Sun.
The Dollars 750m (Pounds 480m) <PERSON>Ulysses</PERSON> mission is a joint project of the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>
and European space agencies, dedicated to exploring the heliosphere. This
region contains mainly ions (charged atoms) and electrons emanating from the
Sun - a bubble blown inside the extremely thin cold gas of interstellar
space by the Sun's hot breath, the solar wind. It encompasses the whole
solar system, except for the planets and their atmospheres.
Because the planets were formed from a disc of debris around the newborn Sun
about 5bn years ago, they all lie within one plane, known as the ecliptic,
which is tilted only slightly from the <ORGANIZATION>Sun</ORGANIZATION>'s equatorial plane.
To explore the solar wind and magnetic field, free of the turbulence and
other complications caused by the planets, <PERSON>John Simpson</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>University of
Chicago</ORGANIZATION> proposed in <DATE>1959</DATE> sending a space probe over the Sun's poles. The
idea became technically feasible in the <DATE>1970s</DATE>, and in <DATE>1977</DATE> the <ORGANIZATION>European
Space Agency</ORGANIZATION> agreed to collaborate with <ORGANIZATION>Nasa</ORGANIZATION> on the Ulysses project.
No rocket is strong enough on its own to send a spacecraft out of the
ecliptic, because it has to cancel Earth's motion around the Sun of 30
km/sec and build up speed in a new direction. But <PERSON>Ulysses</PERSON>' designers
realised that they could use the gravitational pull of the giant planet
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> to propel their car-sized probe into a new plane, like a slingshot
(see diagram).
All went well from <DATE>1977</DATE> until <DATE>1980</DATE>, when the project began an odyssey of
setbacks and delays, caused mainly by technical and financial difficulties
at <ORGANIZATION>Nasa</ORGANIZATION>. Ulysses was eventually launched on a Space Shuttle in <DATE>October 1990</DATE>,
seven and a half years after the original target date.
Once in space, Ulysses performed perfectly. Project scientists took
advantage of its swing past <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>February 1992</DATE> to make the first
detailed survey of the gigantic system of electrical currents, particles and
magnetic fields surrounding the planet.
On route to the Sun's south pole, the nine scientific instruments on Ulysses
have already made important discoveries about the heliosphere: shock waves
in the solar wind; electromagnetic waves with a very long period (more than
10 hours); regular bursts of energetic particles from the Sun; enormous
clouds of ionised gas; and unexpected patterns of cosmic radiation from
elsewhere in the galaxy. The investigators are still working out the
significance of these observations.
'This is our first ever 'bird's eye view' of the Sun's magnetic poles,' says
<PERSON>Roger Bonnet</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Esa</ORGANIZATION>'s science director. 'This new perspective will cast some
light on the origins of the solar wind and is going to improve our models of
the solar interior.
'It may also enable us to anticipate better the variations of solar activity
and forecast their effect on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>,' he adds. For example, <PERSON>Ulysses</PERSON> may give
some clues about the impact of the 11-year sunspot cycle on terrestrial
climate.
Although the mission has taken so long to gestate and execute, some
old-timers are still involved. <PERSON>Willis Meeks</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Nasa</ORGANIZATION>'s Ulysses project manager,
has been working on it for 16 years. And <PERSON>Simpson</PERSON>, the 'father of <PERSON>Ulysses</PERSON>',
is in charge of the largest of the nine experiments, which looks at the
behaviour of cosmic rays in the solar wind. 'I have had plenty of
opportunities to fly experiments on other missions,' he says. 'But <PERSON>Ulysses</PERSON>
remains unique, as the first and only foreseeable mission to the polar
regions of the Sun's heliosphere.'
The spacecraft's new polar orbit will carry it over the Sun's north pole
next <DATE>summer</DATE>. Although current plans call for the mission to end in <DATE>October
1995</DATE>, <LOCATION>Esa</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Nasa</ORGANIZATION> are keen to continue observing until the end of <DATE>2001</DATE>.
They say the modest extra cost, Dollars 50m, would pay large scientific
dividends because the current observations coincide with a quiet period on
the Sun, whereas 2000-2001 will be a period of maximum solar activity.
Whatever happens next, <PERSON>Ulysses</PERSON> has already paid off in <LOCATION>Simpson</LOCATION>'s eyes. 'We
don't have to wonder any longer whether the results will justify the effort
and reward the long wait,' he says. 'We already know they do.'

   A robot explorer named Voyager 2 flies
past <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> <DATE>this week</DATE> for its dazzling last picture show _ the
final photo opportunity during the spacecraft's four-planet, 4.4
billion-mile odyssey.
   ``We're getting close, everything is working extremely well and
we're all excited,'' said <PERSON>Norm Haynes</PERSON>, Voyager project manager at
<ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   ``The surf is definitely up here at <LOCATION>JPL</LOCATION>,'' joked <PERSON>Franklin
O'Donnell</PERSON>, a spokesman for the lab where about 170 scientists from
around the world are asembling for the critical period.
   Coincidentally, <DATE>Sunday</DATE> was the 12th anniversary of Voyager 2's
launch from <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> on <DATE>Aug. 20, 1977</DATE>.
   The researchers will share ultimate exhilaration as front-row
observers for humanity's first close-up look at the solar system's
fourth-largest planet, a blue-green ball nearly four times <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s
diameter.
   But their excitement is tinged with nostalgia because Voyager's
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> encounter will be the last planetary flyby for a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
spacecraft. Future probes will orbit their target planets: <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>
at <LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> and the Mars Observer.
   And with no one planning a mission to <LOCATION>Pluto</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> is the last
unexplored planet that will be visited by a spacecraft from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> in
the foreseeable future.
   ``It's almost like being on a ship of discovery like <PERSON>Marco Polo</PERSON>,
<ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON>Jurrie</PERSON> van der Woude, a <ORGANIZATION>JPL</ORGANIZATION> spokesman.
``For most of us, this is the last picture show, the last foreign
shores we visit in the solar system.''
   Only a few days and a few million miles remain until <TIME>8:59 p.m.
PDT</TIME> <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, when Voyager makes its closest approach to <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> by
skirting 3,000 miles above the planet's cloudtops _ much closer than
its encounters with <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1979</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1981</DATE> and Uranus in
<DATE>1986</DATE>.
   As of <TIME>9 a.m. PDT</TIME> <DATE>Monday</DATE>, Voyager 2 will be 2.743 billion miles
from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and 3.211 million miles from <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, approaching the
planet at 42,310 mph. Since it was launched in <DATE>1977</DATE>, Voyager 2 has
traveled a curving path totaling 4.4 billion miles.
   With a final course correction <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME>, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> engineers
will put Voyager 2 on its precise trajectory for the <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> flyby.
   Sending Voyager to <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> was like ``sinking a 2,260-mile golf
putt, assuming the golfer can make a few illegal fine adjustments
while the ball is rolling across this incredibly long green,'' says
``The Voyager Neptune Travel Guide'' by mission planning manager
<PERSON>Charles Kohlhase</PERSON> and his staff.
   Up to 8,000 photographs from Voyager's two television cameras and
discoveries by 10 other science experiments will pour in so quickly
that the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION> will conduct
daily news conferences starting <DATE>Monday</DATE> and continuing through <DATE>Aug.
29</DATE>.
   By late last week, Voyager had already revealed some of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s
secrets, including:
   _Four previously unknown moons, in addition to <LOCATION>Nereid</LOCATION> and
backward-orbiting <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>, which were discovered from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. Voyager
is likely to discover more moons.
   _Clouds and other weather features, including 2,700-mile-wide
bands similar to jet streams on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, and a 8,100-by-4,100-mile
dark spot, probably a huge storm like <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s Great Red Spot.
   _Two partial rings of debris, called ring arcs, that are much
different from the complete rings that encircle <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> and Uranus.
Scientists say there may be 50 or more ring arcs orbiting <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>.
   _A magnetic field surrounding <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, suggesting the planet also
may have auroras like <ORGANIZATION>Earth</ORGANIZATION>'s northern lights and may be enveloped
by orbiting radiation belts similar to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s Van <PERSON>Allen</PERSON> belts.
   The <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> encounter is the climax of the <MONEY>$865 million</MONEY>,
twin-spacecraft Voyager mission, which also saw Voyager 1 explore
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1979</DATE> and <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1980</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Haynes</PERSON> said <DATE>Monday</DATE>'s course correction will assure Voyager 2 can
aim a radio signal at <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> when the probe starts to pass behind
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Ellis Miner</PERSON>, deputy project scientist, said by measuring changes
in the signal, scientists hope to determine <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s atmospheric
pressures, temperatures and chemical makeup; whether ring arcs are
made of dust, sand, pebbles or boulders; and how material is
distributed inside <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>.
   The radio experiment takes all of Voyager's radio signal
strength, so no other data or photographs will be sent back to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>
for about 2{ hours around the time of close encounter, <ORGANIZATION>Miner</ORGANIZATION> said.
When Voyager sends pictures and data to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, they take four hours
and six minutes to arrive, even traveling at the speed of light,
186,000 miles per second.
   During its closest encounter with <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Voyager</ORGANIZATION> will pass over
the planet's north pole, which will be cloaked in winter darkness.
Six minutes later, <ORGANIZATION>Voyager</ORGANIZATION> will start a 49-minute trip through
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s shadow. Instead of photographing <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> during those
times, the spacecraft will make other measurements and snap pictures
of any ring arcs and of one of the newly discovered moons.

   Twelve years, three planets and 4.4
billion miles after leaving <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, Voyager 2 is converging on
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, a swirling, blue-green planet with a backward moon, for the
last stop on an extraordinary tour.
   ``The solar system is our neighborhood, and we're getting to the
end of the neighborhood,'' said <PERSON>Norm Haynes</PERSON>, Voyager project manager
at the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Admnistration</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
   Voyager 2 already has detected a dark spot on <ORGANIZATION>Nep</ORGANIZATION>
a giant storm like <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s Great Red Spot. As it nears the planet,
the probe will search for undiscovered moons and partial rings. And
at <TIME>9 p.m. PDT</TIME> on <DATE>Aug. 24</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Voyager</ORGANIZATION> will swoop within 3,000 miles oftune
that may be
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s north pole cloudtops _ the closest of its close encounters
and the first spacecraft to visit the planet.
   It will be 2.75 billion miles from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> after traveling 4.43
billion miles along its curving path. The information it sends back
at the speed of light will take four hours and six minutes to arrive.
   Five hours after the closest encounter, <ORGANIZATION>Voyager</ORGANIZATION> will fly within
25,000 miles of the backwards-orbiting moon, <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>. The other known
moon is Nereid.
lion through the <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>
encounter, the Voyagers ``returned more new knowledge about the
outer planets ... than existed in all of the preceding history of
astronomy,'' according to <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>.
   <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, discovered in <DATE>1846</DATE>, is 30,700 miles in diameter _ six
times <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s size and the fourth largest planet after <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>,
<ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> and Uranus. A Neptunian year lasts 165 Earth years, and a day
lasts 17 to 18 Earth hours _ a detail Voyager may pinpoint. Neptune
usually is the eighth planet, but because of <LOCATION>Pluto</LOCATION>'s elongated orbit
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> will be the ninth and outermost until <DATE>2007</DATE>.
   Scientists expect Voyager to discover at least 10 small moons,
said deputy project scientist <PERSON>Ellis Miner</PERSON>.
   Some moons may confine or shepherd the 5- to 12-mile-wide
incomplete rings, called ``ring arcs,'' orbiting <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, said
physicist Ed Stone, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Voyager project scientist and a vice
president at <ORGANIZATION>California Institute of Technology</ORGANIZATION>.
   Voyager also may discover dust bands and 50 to 100 partial rings
in addition to the three to six arcs scientists believe they
detected from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, Stone added. The partial rings, possibly made
of dust and pebbles, most likely are debris from the collision of a
comet and an ancient moon, he said.
   Voyager should be some 33,400 miles above <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s clouds when
it crosses the ring region, so it is unlikely to be destroyed by an
unseen arc, he said.
   The probe also will study <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s weather. Scientists believe
the 6,200-mile-wide dark spot it found probably is similar to
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s hurricanes or <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s Great Red Spot. The source of the
internal heat driving <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s storms is a mystery; Earth's comes
decaying radioactive material in rocks.
   Neptune is pale blue-green because methane, or natural gas, in
its mostly hydrogen-helium atmosphere absorbs red light. Scientists
suspect that a third of the way toward the planet's center the
atmosphere becomes a superhot slurry of hot water and rock, so
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> _ like neighboring Uranus _ probably lacks a distinct
sky-sea boundary, <ORGANIZATION>Stone</ORGANIZATION> said.
   Despite any internal heat, <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> receives 900 times less
sunlight than <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, so the temperature at the top of its atmosphere
is 350 degrees below zero Fahrenheit, about the same as on <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>,
<ORGANIZATION>Stone</ORGANIZATION> said.
   Scientists believe <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> _ 1,400 to 2,240 miles wide, roughly
the size of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s moon _ will be the most fascinating part of
Voyager's flyby.
   When a planet and its moons form from a spinning disk of gas and
solid material, the moons should orbit in the direction the planet
rotates. <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>'s reverse orbit suggests it once orbited the sun
like a comet or a planet but collided with a moon to form a new
backwards-moving satellite, <ORGANIZATION>Stone</ORGANIZATION> said.
   <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> probably is cold and geologically inactive, with an icy
mantle over a rocky core. But it once may have had a molten interior
that created ridges, valleys, cliffs, canyons and volcanoes that
Voyager might photograph.
   Observations from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> indicate <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>'s atmosphere contains
methane and nitrogen. Sunlight likely converts methane into complex
hydrocarbons, creating a transparent reddish-orange photochemical
haze, <ORGANIZATION>Stone</ORGANIZATION> said. The hydrocarbons may form heavier particles,
coating the surface with frozen sludge.
   Could the organic chemicals have allowed life to develop on
<ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>?
   ``The temperature is very, very cold, so I think it's unlikely,''
he said.
   Scientists believe <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> has extreme seasons because its orbit
around <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> is highly inclined: One pole faces the sun for 82
years and the other remains in darkness. This may mean <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>'s
atmosphere gets thinner and thicker as methane-nitrogen icecaps
cover one pole, then the other.
   Researchers discarded the theory that <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> has liquid nitrogen
oceans, but puddles or lakes are possible, along with fields of
nitrogen ice crystals, <ORGANIZATION>Stone</ORGANIZATION> said.
   Nereid, about 190 to 620 miles wide, has a very elongated
elliptical orbit. Caltech astrophysicist <PERSON>Peter Goldreich</PERSON> speculates
Nereid once had a circular orbit that was disturbed by gravity from
<ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> or a large passing object.
   If Voyager confirms that <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> has a magnetic field, the planet
also may have an aurora like <ORGANIZATION>Earth</ORGANIZATION>'s, and a mysterious ultraviolet
``electroglow.'' A magnetic field should trap a radiation belt
around <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> similar to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s Van <PERSON>Allen</PERSON> belts. <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s
radiation belts damaged some of Voyager's equipment; <PERSON>Haynes</PERSON> doubts
similar problems at <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>.
   Voyager 2 has worked 12 years with only relatively minor
failures, although it contains electronics equal to 10,000
television sets, he said.
   Commands sent to <LOCATION>Voyager</LOCATION>, and photos and information it sends to
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, travel at the speed of light. But the one-way trip still take
four hours, six minutes. <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> is using 38 dish-shaped radio antennas
in <LOCATION>New Mexico</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> to capture the
radio signal, which is like trying to see a 20-watt light bulb
burning 2.75 billion miles away.
   ``Both Voyagers are expected to return valuable data well into
the 21st century'' before their power supplies run out in about
<DATE>2020</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> said.
   After <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, Voyager 2 will join Voyager 1 and Pioneers 10 and
11 in seeking the true edge of the solar system, where solar wind
gives way to interstellar wind billions of miles beyond the planets.

   Scientists say pictures of the far side
of the moon taken by the spacecraft <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will help fill a blank
spot on the map of the planet.
   The pictures, taken as <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> sped past the moon and <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> on
its six-year voyage to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, also should reveal more about the
mineral content of the moon's crust, scientists said <DATE>Monday</DATE>.
   ``We're actually doing some new observation,'' said <PERSON>James Head</PERSON>,
a member of <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s imaging team at <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
   The <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION> displayed
black and white photos of the full moon that provided a sharp image
of the <LOCATION>Orientale Basin</LOCATION> as well as portions of both the near and far
sides of the moon.
   The spacecraft swung into the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s gravitational field
<DATE>Saturday</DATE>, hurtling 597 miles above the western <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> at the
point of its closest approach.
   By sweeping near <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> was able to use gravitational
pull like a slingshot to increase its speed by 11,600 mph, boosting
its velocity to 79,000 mph in relation to the sun.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s approach allowed scientists to focus the craft's
cameras on the far side of the moon for the first exploration of
the region since <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Apollo missions in the <DATE>1970s</DATE>.
   The cameras photographed a wedge of moonscape near the south
pole on the far side that somehow was missed by previous <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and
Soviet mapping missions, said project scientist <PERSON>Torrence Johnson</PERSON>.
   ``That's interesting, it's got craters just like the rest of the
moon, but there's no great scientific surprise in that,'' <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON>
said.
   A subsequent journey through the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s magnetic field gave
scientists their first measurements of a solar storm in which
magnetically charged ions take on higher energy levels.
   The data could reveal whether the majority of these ions, which
trigger colorful auroras near <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s magnetic poles, come from the
sun or <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, said <PERSON>Lou Frank</PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s magnetic field
working group.

   Some statistics known about <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> as
Voyager 2 nears the planet for its close examination tonight:
   DIAMETER: About 30,700 miles, nearly four time's <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s diameter
and the fourth largest planet after <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> and Uranus,
which is only a bit larger with a diameter of 31,760 miles.
   MOONS: Two majorones, <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> and Nereid, plus at least four
others discovered so far by Voyager 2. <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>, four-fifths the size
of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s moon, is the only large moon in the solar system to orbit
a planet backwards. That suggests it once was a sun-orbiting comet
that hit a Neptunian moon and was ``captured'' into orbit around
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>.
   RINGS: So far Voyager has found <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> is orbited by one
complete ring of debris, and one ring arc, or partial ring, which
scientists believe also may prove to be a complete ring upon closer
inspection.
   DAY LENGTH: Surface wind suggests <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> takes nearly 18 hours
to spin on its axis, but <ORGANIZATION>Voyager</ORGANIZATION>'s measurements indicate a day on
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> is closer to 16 hours, the time it takes for the bulk of the
planet's interior to rotate.
   YEAR LENGTH: <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> takes 165 Earth years to make a single orbit
around the sun. That means a winter on <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> lasts more than 40
Earth years.
   DISTANCE FROM SUN: Orbits the sun at an average distance of 2.793
billion miles, 30 times as far as <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and invisible to the naked
eye from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. Neptune usually is the eighth planet from the sun,
but because of <LOCATION>Pluto</LOCATION>'s elongated orbit it is now the ninth and
outermost.
   WEATHER: A chilly 307 degrees below zero Fahrenheit at an
altitude where the atmospheric pressure is twice that at sea level
on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. Voyager has revealed cirrus-like clouds, 400-mph wind and
an Earth-sized cyclone and other storms in <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s atmosphere. The
source of the internal heat creating <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s weather is a mystery;
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s comes from decaying radioactive material in rocks.
   ATMOSPHERE: Primarily hydrogen and helium, but <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> appears
pale blue-green because enough methane, the major component of
natural gas, is present to absorb red light.
   STRUCTURE: Scientists suspect that a third of the way toward
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s center the atmosphere gives way to a slurry of water and
rock, with no distinct sky-sea boundary.
   DISCOVERY: In <DATE>1846</DATE>, by <PERSON>Johann Gottfried Galle</PERSON> and <PERSON>Heinrich Louis</PERSON>
d'Arrest at the <ORGANIZATION>Berlin Observatory</ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> was discovered because
its presence was predicted based on disturbances in Uranus' orbit.

   Three weeks after its launch from a
shuttle, the <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> spacecraft fired its thrusters <DATE>Thursday</DATE> to
begin the first of about 30 course changes needed for its
roundabout six-year trip to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``We've started the first trajectory correction maneuver,''
mission director <PERSON>Neal Ausman</PERSON> said after the three-day series of
thruster ignitions got under way at <TIME>8:31 a.m. PST</TIME>.
   During the maneuver, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> is firing four of its 12 thrusters
in a series of pulses, he said. No individual pulse exceeds two
minutes, each set of pulses takes about 45 minutes, and the entire
maneuver will be completed <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>.
   Two other thrusters may be used to correct the spacecraft's rate
of spin and the direction toward which it points, said <PERSON>Ausman</PERSON>, of
the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
   The trajectory change is meant to aim <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> for its flight
past Venus in <DATE>February</DATE>. The spacecraft, launched from space shuttle
Atlantis on <DATE>Oct. 18</DATE>, will swoop by <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> once and Earth twice so
the planets can act as ``gravity slingshots'' to propel <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>
toward <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> during the <MONEY>$1.9 billion</MONEY> mission.
   On <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> was about 31 million miles into its looping
2.4 billion-mile journey to the solar system's largest planet,
<PERSON>Ausman</PERSON> said. It was about 4.6 million miles from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and 58.5
million miles from <LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION>, traveling at 60,376 mph relative to the
sun.
   In <DATE>July 1995</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will separate into an orbiter and a probe.
The orbiter will circle <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> for 22 months starting in <DATE>December
1995</DATE>, the same month the probe will parachute into the Jovian
atmosphere, making measurements for 75 minutes until it is crushed
by intense pressure.
   About 30 course corrections involving thruster firings spread
over 135 days will be required en route to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Ausman</PERSON> said.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> has ignited its 3.5 inch-long thrusters on other
occasions, but those firings were to adjust spin or direction,
<PERSON>Ausman</PERSON> said. The three-day maneuver that started <DATE>Thursday</DATE> is
<ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s first trajectory correction, he added.
   <PERSON>Ausman</PERSON> said the West German-built thrusters have to fire in
pulses to avoid contaminating sensitive parts of <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>. The
thrusters are attached to the spinning part of <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>, and can
fire only when they are not above sensitive areas on the
non-spinning section of the spacecraft.
   The thrusters also are fired in pulses because <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> fears
continuous firing might make them overheat and burn through, a
problem that developed on the same type of thrusters on two
satellites in recent years, <PERSON>Ausman</PERSON> said.

   Twelve years, three planets and 4.4
billion miles after leaving <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, Voyager 2 is converging on
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, a swirling, blue-green planet with a backward moon, for the
last stop on an extraordinary tour.
   ``The solar system is our neighborhood, and we're getting to the
end of the neighborhood,'' said <PERSON>Norm Haynes</PERSON>, Voyager project manager
at the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Admnistration</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
   Voyager 2 already has detected a dark spot on <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> that may be
a giant storm like <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s Great Red Spot. As it nears the planet,
the probe will search for undiscovered moons and partial rings. And
at <TIME>9 p.m. PDT</TIME> on <DATE>Aug. 24</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Voyager</ORGANIZATION> will swoop within 3,000 miles of
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s north pole cloudtops _ the closest of its close encounters
and the first spacecraft to visit the planet.
   It will be 2.75 billion miles from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> after traveling 4.43
billion miles along its curving path. The information it sends back
at the speed of light will take four hours and six minutes to arrive.
   Five hours after the closest encounter, <ORGANIZATION>Voyager</ORGANIZATION> will fly within
25,000 miles of the backwards-orbiting moon, <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>. The other known
moon is Nereid.
   Voyager 1 and 2, laden with TV cameras and an array of sensors,
were launched from <LOCATION>Cape Canaveral</LOCATION> in <DATE>1977</DATE>. They visited <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in
<DATE>1979</DATE> and <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1980</DATE> and <DATE>1981</DATE>, respectively. Voyager 2 reached
Uranus in <DATE>1986</DATE>. Voyager 1 now is heading toward interstellar space.
   Voyager 1 and 2 returned 65,000 photographs of <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION>
and their moons and rings. Voyager 2 sent back 8,000 pictures of
Uranus and its moons, and will take another 8,000 of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>.
   At a cost <PERSON>Haynes</PERSON> pegged at <MONEY>$865 million</MONEY> through the <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>
encounter, the Voyagers ``returned more new knowledge about the
outer planets ... than existed in all of the preceding history of
astronomy,'' according to <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>.
   <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, discovered in <DATE>1846</DATE>, is 30,700 miles in diameter _ six
times <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s size and the fourth largest planet after <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>,
<ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> and Uranus. A Neptunian year lasts 165 Earth years, and a day
lasts 17 to 18 Earth hours _ a detail Voyager may pinpoint. Neptune
usually is the eighth planet, but because of <LOCATION>Pluto</LOCATION>'s elongated orbit
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> will be the ninth and outermost until <DATE>2007</DATE>.
   Scientists expect Voyager to discover at least 10 small moons,
said deputy project scientist <PERSON>Ellis Miner</PERSON>.
   Some moons may confine or shepherd the 5- to 12-mile-wide
incomplete rings, called ``ring arcs,'' orbiting <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, said
physicist Ed Stone, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Voyager project scientist and a vice
president at <ORGANIZATION>California Institute of Technology</ORGANIZATION>.
   Voyager also may discover dust bands and 50 to 100 partial rings
in addition to the three to six arcs scientists believe they
detected from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, Stone added. The partial rings, possibly made
of dust and pebbles, most likely are debris from the collision of a
comet and an ancient moon, he said.
   Voyager should be some 33,400 miles above <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s clouds when
it crosses the ring region, so it is unlikely to be destroyed by an
unseen arc, he said.
   The probe also will study <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s weather. Scientists believe
the 6,200-mile-wide dark spot it found probably is similar to
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s hurricanes or <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s Great Red Spot. The source of the
internal heat driving <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s storms is a mystery; Earth's comes
decaying radioactive material in rocks.
   Neptune is pale blue-green because methane, or natural gas, in
its mostly hydrogen-helium atmosphere absorbs red light. Scientists
suspect that a third of the way toward the planet's center the
atmosphere becomes a superhot slurry of hot water and rock, so
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> _ like neighboring Uranus _ probably lacks a distinct
sky-sea boundary, <ORGANIZATION>Stone</ORGANIZATION> said.
   Despite any internal heat, <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> receives 900 times less
sunlight than <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, so the temperature at the top of its atmosphere
is 350 degrees below zero Fahrenheit, about the same as on <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>,
<ORGANIZATION>Stone</ORGANIZATION> said.
   Scientists believe <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> _ 1,400 to 2,240 miles wide, roughly
the size of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s moon _ will be the most fascinating part of
Voyager's flyby.
   When a planet and its moons form from a spinning disk of gas and
solid material, the moons should orbit in the direction the planet
rotates. <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>'s reverse orbit suggests it once orbited the sun
like a comet or a planet but collided with a moon to form a new
backwards-moving satellite, <ORGANIZATION>Stone</ORGANIZATION> said.
   <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> probably is cold and geologically inactive, with an icy
mantle over a rocky core. But it once may have had a molten interior
that created ridges, valleys, cliffs, canyons and volcanoes that
Voyager might photograph.
   Observations from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> indicate <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>'s atmosphere contains
methane and nitrogen. Sunlight likely converts methane into complex
hydrocarbons, creating a transparent reddish-orange photochemical
haze, <ORGANIZATION>Stone</ORGANIZATION> said. The hydrocarbons may form heavier particles,
coating the surface with frozen sludge.
   Could the organic chemicals have allowed life to develop on
<ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>?
   ``The temperature is very, very cold, so I think it's unlikely,''
he said.
   Scientists believe <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> has extreme seasons because its orbit
around <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> is highly inclined: One pole faces the sun for 82
years and the other remains in darkness. This may mean <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>'s
atmosphere gets thinner and thicker as methane-nitrogen icecaps
cover one pole, then the other.
   Researchers discarded the theory that <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> has liquid nitrogen
oceans, but puddles or lakes are possible, along with fields of
nitrogen ice crystals, <ORGANIZATION>Stone</ORGANIZATION> said.
   Nereid, about 190 to 620 miles wide, has a very elongated
elliptical orbit. Caltech astrophysicist <PERSON>Peter Goldreich</PERSON> speculates
Nereid once had a circular orbit that was disturbed by gravity from
<ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> or a large passing object.
   If Voyager confirms that <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> has a magnetic field, the planet
also may have an aurora like <ORGANIZATION>Earth</ORGANIZATION>'s, and a mysterious ultraviolet
``electroglow.'' A magnetic field should trap a radiation belt
around <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> similar to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s Van <PERSON>Allen</PERSON> belts. <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s
radiation belts damaged some of Voyager's equipment; <PERSON>Haynes</PERSON> doubts
similar problems at <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>.
   Voyager 2 has worked 12 years with only relatively minor
failures, although it contains electronics equal to 10,000
television sets, he said.
   Commands sent to <LOCATION>Voyager</LOCATION>, and photos and information it sends to
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, travel at the speed of light. But the one-way trip still take
four hours, six minutes. <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> is using 38 dish-shaped radio antennas
in <LOCATION>New Mexico</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> to capture the
radio signal, which is like trying to see a 20-watt light bulb
burning 2.75 billion miles away.
   ``Both Voyagers are expected to return valuable data well into
the 21st century'' before their power supplies run out in about
<DATE>2020</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> said.
   After <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, Voyager 2 will join Voyager 1 and Pioneers 10 and
11 in seeking the true edge of the solar system, where solar wind
gives way to interstellar wind billions of miles beyond the planets.

<TEXT>
   After the <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> spacecraft goes into
orbit around <LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION> on <DATE>Aug. 10</DATE>, it will use radar to map the surface
of the cloud-covered planet. Here is some of what scientists
already know about the second planet from the sun:
   DIAMETER: About 7,520 miles, or <PERCENT>95 percent</PERCENT> as wide as <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>;
sixth largest of the solar system's nine known planets.
   MASS: Venus weighs about <PERCENT>82 percent</PERCENT> as much as <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   ATMOSPHERE: About <PERCENT>97 percent</PERCENT> carbon dioxide, with trace amounts
of nitrogen, sulfur dioxide, water vapor, argon, oxygen, carbon
monoxide, neon, and hydrochloric and hydrofluoric acids. The
planet's clouds contain sulfuric acid droplets. The atmosphere
traps heat in a runaway ``greenhouse effect'' that scientists
believe evaporated liquid water long ago, if there ever was any on
the planet. Large fluctuations in sulfur dioxide levels may
indicate that active volcanoes pump the gas into <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' atmosphere.
   SURFACE CONDITIONS: Temperature about 900 degrees Fahrenheit,
hot enough to melt lead, zinc or tin. Crushing atmospheric pressure
90 times that on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s surface, or equivalent to the pressure
2,700 feet beneath the surface of an ocean on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   THE CALENDAR: A day on Venus lasts longer than a year. A
Venusian year _ the time it takes for the planet to orbit the sun _
lasts 225 Earth days. A Venusian day _ the time the planet takes to
spin once on its axis _ lasts 243 Earth days. Venus also has
retrograde rotation, so the sun rises in the west and sets in the
east.
   DISTANCE FROM THE SUN: Venus is the second planet from the sun,
orbiting at a distance of 67.2 million miles. It is closer to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>
than any other planet. Other than the sun and moon, <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> is the
brightest object in <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s skies.
   MOONS: None.
   GEOLOGY: Earth-based and spacecraft radar revealed hundreds of
thousands of volcanoes on the Venusian lowlands, although
scientists don't yet know if any are active. Venus also has
meteorite impact craters and continent-like highlands with towering
peaks that dwarf Earth's tallest mountains. Scientists suspect
giant plates of rock may move in <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' crust in a process vaguely
like continental drift on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. Venus' surface is about <PERCENT>65 percent</PERCENT>
rolling plains, <PERCENT>27 percent</PERCENT> flat lowlands and <PERCENT>8 percent</PERCENT> highlands
that may be similar to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s continents.
   GRAVITY: About <PERCENT>89 percent</PERCENT> as strong as on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   MAGNETIC FIELD: None detected so far, suggesting <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> now lacks
a liquid core, which is needed to generate a magnetic field.

   The Ulysses spacecraft is wobbling like
an off-balance washing machine, threatening to cripple the <MONEY>$750
million</MONEY> U.S.-European mission to study the sun's poles.
   Ulysses, launched from space shuttle Discovery on <DATE>Oct. 6</DATE>,
started gyrating on <DATE>Nov. 4</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>The Associated Press</ORGANIZATION> learned.
   Officials this week confirmed the problem's existence, and said
they hope they can work around the malfunction so it doesn't
significantly harm <PERSON>Ulysses</PERSON>' five-year mission.
   The wobble will leave the spacecraft's main dish-shaped antenna
unable to point at <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> continuously.
   ``If we can't do anything about it, it's very serious,'' said
<PERSON>Edgar Page</PERSON>, <PERSON>Ulysses</PERSON> science coordinator for the <ORGANIZATION>European Space
Agency</ORGANIZATION>. The loss of data could range from <PERCENT>20 percent</PERCENT> to <PERCENT>90 percent</PERCENT>,
he said.
   The data is to be transmitted to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> during <DATE>1994-1995</DATE>, when
the spacecraft would be the first to orbit the sun's polar regions.
   Engineers hope to minimize the wobble during critical periods by
repeatedly firing the spacecraft's thrusters.
   ``Gloom is something I don't feel,'' said <PERSON>Willis Meeks</PERSON>, Ulysses
project manager at <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. ``I'm sure
that somehow during the next four years we'll find a way to learn
to live with this problem.''
   Page said that for several tense days late last month, mission
officials worried that they might permanently lose contact with the
<MONEY>$250 million</MONEY> spacecraft.
   Ulysses' trouble is yet another in a series of problems for the
<ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION>. Others include a
flawed mirror on the <ORGANIZATION>Hubble Space Telescope</ORGANIZATION>, space shuttle fuel
leaks and a malfunctioning Astro observatory on the most recent
shuttle flight.
   The Jet Propulsion Laboratory here has successfully handled
balky spacecraft, including a stuck camera platform on one of the
Voyagers and <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s radio blackouts.
   Ulysses is a joint mission of the <ORGANIZATION>European Space Agency</ORGANIZATION>, which
supplied the spacecraft and half its science instruments, and <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>,
which built the remaining instruments, launched the spacecraft and
is tracking it.
   On <DATE>Friday</DATE>, it was 40.6 million miles from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, flying toward a
<DATE>1992</DATE> encounter with <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>.
   The planet's gravity will act like a slingshot to hurl Ulysses
toward solar orbit. Ulysses is supposed to loop around the sun's
south pole during <DATE>May-September 1994</DATE> and over its north pole during
<DATE>May-September 1995</DATE>.
   The slow wobble, technically called ``nutation,'' suddenly
developed <DATE>Nov. 4</DATE> when Ulysses extended a 24{-foot-long antenna
boom. The boom, designed to study radio signals in space and waves
in the solar wind, may have become bent.
   ``It is a very big wobble. We were all amazed,'' Page told <ORGANIZATION>AP
Network News</ORGANIZATION>.
   The wobble diminished in recent days as Ulysses moved farther
from the sun and the antenna is shaded by the spacecraft, <PERSON>Meeks</PERSON>
said.
   Because of that, the leading suspected culprit is that heat from
the sun bent the boom, <PERSON>Meeks</PERSON> and Page said.
   If the theory is right, the wobble soon should disappear for a
while, but Page said it will return during the critical times when
<PERSON>Ulysses</PERSON> is studying the sun's poles.
   Ulysses doesn't need to get close to the sun, only fly past the
poles. So it never will be closer to the sun than it was on the day
it was launched.
   Engineers theorize the bent boom makes Ulysses wobble as it
spins, much like an off-centered washing machine agitator. The
spacecraft was designed to spin so it wouldn't wobble. The boom
can't be retracted.
   Page said he didn't think <PERSON>Ulysses</PERSON>' builder, <ORGANIZATION>Dornier Deutsche
Aerospace</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>, was to blame. The company ``appeared to
satisfy all the test requirements we had,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   A space probe grounded for 3{ years by
the Challenger explosion has been rebuilt for an <DATE>October</DATE> launch to
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, where it will plunge to its doom as it seeks clues to the
birth of the solar system.
   The <MONEY>$1.36 billion</MONEY> <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> mission should climax in <DATE>December 1995</DATE>,
when the probe deploys a parachute and collects information for 75
minutes before it is crushed by <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s intense atmospheric
pressure.
   Its mother ship, the <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> orbiter, will circle the planet for
22 months.
   <ORGANIZATION>Hughes Aircraft Co.</ORGANIZATION> planned to deliver the refurbished <MONEY>$157
million</MONEY> <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> probe late this afternoon in <LOCATION>Pasadena</LOCATION>, where <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s
Jet Propulsion Laboratory is completing modifications to the orbiter.
   ``This is a very proud day for us. We are ready to deliver it to
<ORGANIZATION>JPL</ORGANIZATION> on its way to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON>Hughes</PERSON> Vice President <PERSON>Steven Dorfman</PERSON>
said at a news conference <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
   JPL will send the 4-foot-diameter, teardrop-shaped probe to
<ORGANIZATION>Kennedy Space Center</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> in late <DATE>April</DATE>, followed by the
orbiter in <DATE>mid-May</DATE>. The probe and orbiter then will be hooked up
together, placed atop a booster rocket, and finally loaded into the
cargo bay of the shuttle Atlantis.
   The shuttle, set for launch no earlier than <DATE>Oct. 12</DATE> and no later
than about <DATE>Nov. 21</DATE>, will release the combined <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> spacecraft
into <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> orbit. Then <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s rocket will fire, sending the
orbiter and probe on a circuitous, 2.4-billion-mile, six-year voyage
to the solar system's largest planet, which is the fifth planet from
the sun and is about 400 million miles from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   En route to the giant gaseous planet, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will observe two
asteroids. The probe and orbiter will separate 150 days before they
reach <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, then fly in tandem until the probe enters the
atmosphere at 115,000 mph. The probe will deploy a parachute and
descend about 370 miles through Jovian skies until it is crushed by
pressure more than 25 times <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s atmosphere.
   Data from the probe will help scientists better understand the
origin of <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, the solar system and the universe, said <PERSON>Richard
Young</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> probe project scientist at the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics
and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Ames Research Center</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Mountain View</LOCATION>.
   Scientists believe the Jovian atmosphere could be a sample of the
original material from which stars are formed, according to a Hughes
statement.
   The orbiter will measure <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s electrical particle and
magnetic fields, and snap 50,000 photographs of the planet and its
moons, including Io, <LOCATION>Europa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ganymede</LOCATION> and Callisto, which were
discovered in <DATE>1610</DATE> by Italian astronomer <ORGANIZATION>Galileo Galilei</ORGANIZATION>.
   The spacecraft had been scheduled for launch from a space shuttle
in <DATE>May 1986</DATE> and powered out of orbit atop a Centaur booster for a
three-year trip to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>. But Challenger exploded on <DATE>Jan. 28,
1986</DATE>, killing its crew of seven and grounding the shuttle fleet
until last <DATE>fall</DATE>.
   After the tragedy, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> decided it was too dangerous to carry
liquid-fueled Centaur rockets aboard the shuttle. <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s route to
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> was drastically redesigned and lengthened from three years
to six because <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> are no longer aligned as ideally as
they were in <DATE>1986</DATE> and because <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s new solid-fueled booster is
less powerful.
   The launch delay and longer flight time prompted a decision to
take the probe apart for refurbishing and to make sure some parts
wouldn't fail because of aging.
   <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> approval for the launch is expected in <DATE>September</DATE>,
said <PERSON>Richard Spehalski</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> project manager at <ORGANIZATION>JPL</ORGANIZATION>. Such
approval is needed because the probe and orbiter each carry a power
plant and heater containing radioactive plutonium. A <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>
environmental impact statement concluded last month that the risk of
a nuclear accident when the shuttle lifts off with <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> is very
small.

   Atlantis outwaited fickle weather
and streaked into orbit today, carrying five astronauts who will
dispatch the <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> probe to cloud-shrouded <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> for the best
look yet at <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s nearest neighbor.
   The winged space shuttle thundered smoothly into the <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> sky
at <TIME>2:47 p.m. EDT</TIME>, after being delayed a nail-biting 59 minutes by
shifting rain clouds and winds that had threatened a second
postponement in six days. <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> had 64 minutes in which to launch
today and used all but five minutes of that time.
   ``It was another cliff-hanger,'' said acting <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> administrator
<PERSON>Dale Meyers</PERSON>.
   The launch starts a 15-month journey of 806 million miles for
the robot explorer craft <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>, the first American deep space
probe in 11 years. The <MONEY>$550 million</MONEY> craft, which had to be launched
by <DATE>May 28</DATE> or wait two years, is carrying to Venus a powerful radar
system that will map most of the planet. <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> is named for the
16th-century Portuguese explorer.
   Atlantis, riding a 700-foot cascade of flame, rose majestically
from its beachside launch pad into a blue, nearly cloudless sky,
rolled slowly on its planned path and streaked up and out of view.
   Two solid-fueled rocket booster rockets burned out after 2
minutes, six seconds, precisely on schedule, and were jettisoned.
Atlantis flew on, powered by its liquid-fueled rockets.
   The successful launch came despite dark clouds and showers
earlier in the day. By late in the launch window, sea breezes had
swept the skies and crosswinds were below the permitted 14 mph at
the <ORGANIZATION>Kennedy Space Center</ORGANIZATION> emergency landing site.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s first attempt to launch Atlantis last <DATE>Friday</DATE> was halted
just 31 seconds before liftoff when a flaw was detected in a fuel
pump. Later, engineers also found what appeared to be a leak in a
hydrogen fuel line. Both parts were replaced.
   The crew members for the mission, the 29th shuttle flight and
the fourth since the Challenger disaster, are commander <PERSON>David M.
Walker</PERSON>, pilot <PERSON>Ronald Grabe</PERSON>, and mission specialists <PERSON>Norman Thagard</PERSON>,
<PERSON>Mary Cleave</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mark Lee</PERSON>.
   Six hours after launch, Cleave and Lee operate remote controls
to eject <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> from the shuttle's cargo bay. A powerful rocket
will then send <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> out of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> orbit and start it on a voyage
that will carry it 1{ times around the sun before reaching <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>.
   Atlantis is to spend four days orbiting 184 miles above <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>
while the crew operates scientific experiments. Landing is set for
<DATE>Monday</DATE> at <ORGANIZATION>Edwards Air Force Base</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Calif</LOCATION>.
   Today's launch opportunity was determined by the path <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>
must follow to reach <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s mysterious neighbor. If the launch had
been postponed, there would have been daily launch opportunities
until <DATE>May 28</DATE>. At that point, <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> would have moved out
of alignment and the <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> mission would not be possible for two
years.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> marks the beginning of a new era in a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> planetary
exploration program that has not had a launch since <DATE>1978</DATE>.
   Venus has fascinated since humans first began scanning the sky.
It is the brightest object in the nighttime sky, except for the
moon. It appears in season as either the morning or the evening
``star,'' but <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> is actually a planet that orbits 67 million
miles from the sun. The <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> orbits 93 million miles from the sun.
   Scientists are intrigued by <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> because it is so close in size
to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, yet much different in most every other way. Venus rotates
the opposite direction of the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, which means the sun rises in
the west. Its rotation is so slow that a Venusian day lasts 243
Earth days.
   Venus is shrouded with dense clouds and its surface cannot be
seen by telescopes on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, giving the planet an aura of mystery.
   Space probes in recent years have proven that <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' surface
temperature is about 900 degrees, hot enough to melt lead. The
atmosphere is carbon dioxide at intense pressures, with
high-altitude clouds of sulfuric acid.
   The torrid heat long ago boiled away any water that was on the
planet, but probes have hinted of vast mountain ranges, towering
volcanoes, and barren plains.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> will rendezvous with <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> in <DATE>August 1990</DATE>. It will
settle into an elongated orbit, sooping to within 155 miles of the
surface, and then sweeping out to a high point of almost 5,000
miles.
   The 3{-ton spacecraft carries an imaging radar that will give
the clearest picture yet of Venus. The radar is able to penetrate
the cloud cover and detect surface features as small as a football
field.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> is expected to map about <PERCENT>90 percent</PERCENT> of Venus. The radar
will operate during 2,000 passes over the planet, each time viewing
a slice of surface and sending the image back to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> for computer
enhancement. The mapping expedition is expected to last about eight
months.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> is the first in a series of deep space probes and marks
what <PERSON>Lennard Fisk</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space
Administration</ORGANIZATION>'s chief scientist, called ``a resurgence of
<LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s planetary program.''
   Pioneer-Venus, in <DATE>1978</DATE>, was the last <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> space launch and <PERSON>Fisk</PERSON>
said <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> ``had a planetary program that was in danger of being
an also-ran.''
   Voyager 2, launched in <DATE>1977</DATE>, will fly past <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> in <DATE>August</DATE>. It
earlier visted <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> and Uranus. In <DATE>October</DATE>, the robot
craft <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will be launched toward <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>. A space telescope
will be launched next year, followed by probes to the sun in <DATE>1990</DATE>,
and to <ORGANIZATION>Mars</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1992</DATE>.
   ``Nobody is going to question our leadership in planetary
(exploration) again,'' said <PERSON>Fisk</PERSON>.

<HEAD>Spacecraft Reveals Broad Bands of Clouds Encircling Neptune's Poles</HEAD>

   Neptune's poles may be encircled by broad
bands of dark clouds blown by jet streams like those on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, say scientists studying a new photograph from the Voyager 2
space probe.
   Two dark bands, each about 2,700 miles wide, are clearly visible
forming a collar around <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s south pole. The photograph also
shows hints of similar banding around the north pole, said <PERSON>Edward
Stone</PERSON>, Voyager project scientist for <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
   ``They are probably regions of clouds associated with high-speed
jet streams,'' said <ORGANIZATION>Stone</ORGANIZATION>, a physicist and vice president at the
<ORGANIZATION>California Institute of Technology</ORGANIZATION>.
   The planet's southern hemisphere bands stretch from 50 degrees
south latitude to 70 degrees south latitude, said <PERSON>Candice Hansen</PERSON>, a
planetary scientist at <ORGANIZATION>Jet Propulsion Laboratory</ORGANIZATION>.
   The new photograph was taken by Voyager 2 on <DATE>June 22</DATE> when it was
57.2 million miles from <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>. Because of the time needed to
process an enhanced color image, it was released <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> by the
<ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION>, which called it ``the
best color photo of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> taken so far by the Voyager 2
spacecraft.''
   Today, the spacecraft was 44.6 million miles from the remote
planet, cruising at 42,202 mph as it headed for its <DATE>Aug. 24</DATE> close
encounter with the solar system's fourth-largest planet.
   Voyager was 2.67 billion miles from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, but has traveled 4.38
billion miles along its curving path since it was launched 12 years
ago.
   The photograph shows in greater detail a large dark spot _ a
cloud system bigger than the entire planet Mars _ seen in earlier
images of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>. Scientists have said the 6,200-mile-wide spot
probably is a storm similar to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s Great Red Spot or <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s
hurricanes.
   Earth's jet streams are 65- to 200-mph high-altitude air currents
that zigzag across various latitudes as they blow around the globe.
The cloud bands on <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> and apparently on <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> are
straight belts encircling those planets. Uranus also shows faint
hints of narrower cloud bands.
   Scientists believe <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s jet streams meander across latitudinal
lines because of interference from continents and temperature
differences in the oceans.
   It may be that the bands are straight on the giant planets
because those worlds have extremely thick atmospheres with
relatively simple wind patterns, said <PERSON>Hansen</PERSON> and Caltech planetary
scientist <PERSON>Andrew Ingersoll</PERSON>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s 250-mph jet streams are found along the edges of its
cloud bands, and scientists suspect the same is true on <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>,
<ORGANIZATION>Stone</ORGANIZATION> said. There is no obvious association between jet streams and
cloud bands on <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION>, he added.
   Stone said that on <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, and possibly <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, the cloud bands
help create the jet streams and then are blown by them. <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s
clouds are pushed to high altitudes by winds stirred up by heat
within the planet. They try to fall back to lower elevations by
moving north or south. But the planet's rotation deflects the
falling clouds to form jet streams, he said.
   Voyager is still too far from <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> to determine if the bands
contain dark high-altitude clouds or if they are broad ribbons of
clear sky that allow Voyager to peer at dark clouds lower in
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s atmosphere, said <PERSON>Rich Terrile</PERSON>, a Jet Propulsion Laboratory
astronomer.
   Studying <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s atmosphere will give scientists ``an
understanding of the circulation pattern on a planet at one of the
most remote fringes of our solar system,'' <PERSON>Terrile</PERSON> said, adding that
knowledge of alien atmospheres ``improves our ability to understand
our own atmosphere.''
   Voyager 2 and its twin, Voyager 1, were launched from <LOCATION>Cape
Canaveral</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla.</LOCATION>, in <DATE>1977</DATE>.
   They explored <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1979</DATE>. Voyager 1 flew past <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1980</DATE>
and is headed toward interstellar space. Voyager 2 encountered
<ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1981</DATE>, Uranus in <DATE>1986</DATE> and will fly about 3,000 miles above
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s north pole cloudtops at <TIME>9 p.m. PDT</TIME> <DATE>Aug. 24</DATE>.
   Five hours later it will encounter <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s backward-orbiting
moon, <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>, at a distance of about 25,000 miles.
   Neptune usually is the eighth planet from the sun, but because of
<LOCATION>Pluto</LOCATION>'s elongated orbit <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> will be the ninth and outermost
until <DATE>2007</DATE>.

   Five astronauts tracked a perfect
countdown <DATE>Thursday</DATE> as technicians prepared the shuttle Atlantis for
a midafternoon launch on <DATE>Friday</DATE>. The mission will propel <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s
``Magellan'' probe to <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> and revive <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s deep-space science
program.
   ``After an 11-year gap in the planetary program, we're anxious
to get started,'' said <PERSON>John H. Gerpheide</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> project manager.
   Officials described the countdown as the smoothest of four since
the Challenger disaster. The chance of high winds provided slight
concern as <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> looked forward to liftoff in an unusually tight
launch window that opens at <TIME>2:24 p.m. EDT</TIME> and lasts justs 23
minutes.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>, ready for its 15-month flight to <LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION>, ``is 100
percent healthy and ticking along,'' said <PERSON>Lennard Fisk</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s
chief scientist. ``We're ready to go fly,'' said <PERSON>Richard Truly</PERSON>, who
heads the shuttle program and is the incoming <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> administrator.
   Earlier <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, three Soviet cosmonauts returned to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>,
leaving the Mir space station unattended for the first time in more
than two years. Two of the cosmonauts had been in space for five
months, the other for eight months.
   Atlantis' cargo is the <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> spacecraft which has a radar
system powerful enough to pierce the dense sulfuric acid clouds of
Venus and map its surface. The mission costs <MONEY>$550 million</MONEY>, not
including the <MONEY>$225 million</MONEY> cost of the four-day shuttle flight.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s radar images, relayed to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and enhanced by
computer, should reveal details as small as 100 yards across, about
the size of a football field. That is 10 times sharper than
previous pictures of the planet.
   <PERSON>Stephen Saunders</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> project scientist, said the radar
images could help scientists understand how Venus was formed and
might provide an answer to the puzzling question of how Earth and
Venus evolved so differently even though they were almost identical
when the solar system formed 4.6 billion years ago.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> deployment is scheduled 6 hours 18 minutes after
liftoff, with astronauts <PERSON>Mark Lee</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mary Cleave</PERSON> conducting a
countdown from inside their shuttle cabin. An hour after the
release, a rocket is to fire to hurl the 7,600-pound unmanned probe
on a 450-day journey to <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>, a complex trip that takes <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>
one and one-half times around the sun before it intercepts its
target planet.
   The Atlantis crew also includes commander <PERSON>David Walker</PERSON>, pilot
<PERSON>Ronald Grabe</PERSON> and mission specialist <PERSON>Norman Thagard</PERSON>. Lee is the only
one who has not flown on a previous shuttle mission.
   Spending cutbacks and delays forced by the <DATE>1986</DATE> Challenger
accident prompted <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> to use the roundabout approach to <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>. The
trip could have been made in four months under better circumstances.
   The first American planetary mission since <DATE>1978</DATE> will mark the
beginning of a busy year for <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s planetary program. ``In <DATE>August</DATE>
the Voyager spacecraft will fly by <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> and in <DATE>October</DATE> we'll
launch <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> (from the shuttle) to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON>Gerpheide</PERSON> said.
   At a briefing for reporters <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Fisk</PERSON> vowed, ``No
one is going to question our leadership in planetary (flight)
again.''
   The Atlantis countdown began <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> and was progressing so
smoothly <DATE>Thursday</DATE> that the launch team had time to relax during a
15-hour halt of the clock. The time had been set aside for catchup
work.
   ``We just don't have anything out there that we're worried
about; it's been a real smooth count and we expect it to continue
that way,'' said countdown director <PERSON>Ron Phelps</PERSON>.
   Weather officers said they were keeping one eye on scattered
clouds which were moving into the skies above <LOCATION>Moron</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>, where
an airbase serves as an emergency landing site in the event of a
problem after launch.
   The astronauts were briefed throughout the day on the status of
the countdown and reviewed their flight plans. They were to retire
early <DATE>Friday</DATE>, arising about <TIME>9 a.m.</TIME> to prepare for the afternoon
launch. Only five of the 28 earlier shuttle flights took off after
noon.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> is to orbit the cloud-veiled planet and map up to <PERCENT>90
percent</PERCENT> of the surface during 243 Earth days, equal to one Venusian
day.
   Low resolution pictures obtained by earlier spacecraft hint at
Earth-like mountain ranges and rolling plains, but the surface
temperature on Venus is 900 degrees and the atmospheric pressure is
90 times that of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s.
   The last planetary mission launched by the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> was the
<DATE>1978</DATE> Pioneer-Venus probe. Voyager 2, launched in <DATE>1977</DATE>, will take
the first closeup look at <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> in <DATE>August</DATE> after earlier exploring
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> and Uranus.
   Other major science projects planned in the next three years are
the launch of the <ORGANIZATION>Hubble Space Telescope</ORGANIZATION> from a shuttle early next
year, the Ulysses probe to study the sun in <DATE>October, 1990</DATE>, and the
Mars Observer spacecraft in <DATE>1992</DATE>.
