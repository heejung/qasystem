   Apollo 11 astronaut <PERSON>Buzz Aldrin</PERSON> led
a parade <DATE>Saturday</DATE> through <ORGANIZATION>Johnson Space Center</ORGANIZATION> in the city whose
name was the first word ever spoken on the <DATE>moon two decades ago</DATE>.
   ``On <DATE>July 20, 1969</DATE>, men first stepped on the moon and made more
than footprints in history,'' <PERSON>Aldrin</PERSON> told space fans at a rally
beside what would have been Apollo 18, the giant <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> 5 rocket
whose mission was scuttled by an expensive war in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>.
   Aldrin, minus his fellow moon-walker of 20 years ago, <PERSON>Neil
Armstrong</PERSON>, was one of 14 Apollo astronauts who attended the
<DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME> events commemorating the successful <DATE>1969</DATE> mission
and other past accomplishments and looking ahead to an expanded
program of space exploration.
   When men first landed on the moon <DATE>July 20, 1969</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION> had
said: ``<LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Tranquillity Base</ORGANIZATION> here. The <ORGANIZATION>Eagle</ORGANIZATION> has landed.''
   ``Since then, we've seen many triumphs and tragedies in our
quest in space,'' <PERSON>Aldrin</PERSON> said, stopping for applause from the large
crowds surrounding Rocket Park. ``And now, thanks to President
<PERSON>Bush</PERSON>, we continue to reach for the stars.''
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>, in his speech <DATE>Thursday</DATE> on the 20th anniversary of the
lunar landing, called for a continuing commitment to space
exploration.
   Several thousand people attended the parade and rally at <ORGANIZATION>Johnson
Space Center</ORGANIZATION>, where <PERSON>Aldrin</PERSON> and others thanked <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION> and the
surrounding cities for their support of the space program.
   Crowds that lined streets for the space center's first public
parade waved American flags and cheered the astronauts who have
lived and worked in the <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION> area, where the astronaut corps is
based.
   Hot air balloons lifted into the air and T-38 training jets flew
in formation over the festivities.
   Aldrin received a plaque with a footprint like the ones left on
the moon, and a child's handprint. It was enscribed, ``When we
touch the moon again.''
   ``Not unlike earthbound explorers and adventurers before us, we
search for yet-unknown treasures and try to unlock and understand
the mysteries of nature,'' <PERSON>Aldrin</PERSON> said. ``It is inherent in our
kind to strive for a better understanding of life and a richer
source of understanding.''
   Aldrin joined <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s current chief astronaut, Capt. <PERSON>Dan
Brandenstein</PERSON>, in recognizing other astronauts and space program
contributors before and after the historic moon mission.
   On stage with <PERSON>Aldrin</PERSON> and <PERSON>Brandenstein</PERSON> were astronauts
representing missions Apollo 9 _ the first to reach lunar distance
_ through Apollo 17.
   ``The Apollo landing, as you're all well aware, was probably the
premier event in the <DATE>last 20 years</DATE> or better and we are proud to
have these men back with us today,'' <PERSON>Brandenstein</PERSON> said. ``However,
a program like the Apollo program takes a great deal of teamwork,
as do many of the other (<ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>) programs.''
   Just as the <ORGANIZATION>Mercury</ORGANIZATION> and Gemini programs laid the groundwork for
Apollo and the trip to the moon, Apollo helped lay the base for the
shuttle era and the work on the space station, he said.

<TEXT>
   Twenty years after the first moon
walk, the Apollo 11 crew called for further exploration of the lunar
surface and Mars, but another astronaut said a bold new program is
unlikely soon.
   <PERSON>Neil Armstrong</PERSON>, <PERSON>Buzz Aldrin</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mike Collins</PERSON>, at a ceremony
<DATE>Sunday</DATE> commemorating the anniversary of their spectacular liftoff on
<DATE>July 16, 1969</DATE>, expressed their hopes for a rejuvenated space program.
   On <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, the anniversary of the landing, they will join with
President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> for a celebration outside the <ORGANIZATION>National Air and Space
Museum</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION>
   There, <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> will deliver a speech on space policy. Some are
pressing him to announce a return to the moon, while others are
pushing for an exploration to Mars. Many scientists are suggesting a
joint U.S.-Soviet exploration for either option.
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> said in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> on <DATE>Sunday</DATE> he was weighing different ideas.
   At <LOCATION>Cape Canaveral</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION>, told 6,000 flag-waving space
workers and their families <DATE>Sunday</DATE> that they should ``allow ourselves
just a touch of pride, a touch of satisfaction, that we were
participants and witnesses to the birth of a new human era.''
   He said historians in future centuries will identify the <DATE>20th
century</DATE> ``as the time when the human species broke the bonds of
gravity that had heretofore bound them to this planet.''
   In brief remarks, <PERSON>Aldrin</PERSON>, who walked on the moon with <ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION>,
and <PERSON>Collins</PERSON>, who remained in lunar orbit in the command ship, looked
to future space exploration.
   ``One of these years, and I hope it won't be too long, this
country will decide to press on again far out into space, perhaps to
the planet Mars,'' <PERSON>Collins</PERSON> said.
   Aldrin said <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Freedom space station, to be assembled in
orbit in the mid-1990s, should serve as a stepping stone to a manned
lunar base and human flights to Mars.
   He called President <PERSON>John F. Kennedy</PERSON>'s commitment to the moon
landing goal 28 years ago ``a starter's gun for our pioneering giant
leap for mankind.''
   ``We're not yet ready for that go again. But perhaps we are at
the starting line, prepared to take our marks or get set,'' <PERSON>Aldrin</PERSON>
said.
   Following the ceremony, the astronauts rode in a
20-mile-motorcade from the space center to <LOCATION>Cocoa Beach</LOCATION>, where they
attended a luncheon in their honor. An estimated 10,000 people lined
the route to cheer the spacemen and to take pictures.
   For <ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Aldrin</PERSON> and <PERSON>Collins</PERSON>, the ceremony was the second
stop on a week-long sentimental journey that began <DATE>Saturday</DATE> with a
visit to the <ORGANIZATION>Marshall Space Flight Center</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Huntsville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ala.</LOCATION>, where
their <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> 5 rocket was designed.
   In <LOCATION>Huntsville</LOCATION> on <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, Apollo 12 astronaut Alan Bean had a more
pessimistic view of space exploration in the near future.
   Bean, the fourth man to walk on the moon, said that until the
<LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> decides to put a man on the moon or take some other
such step, Americans will be complacent about their space
achievements.
   ``Sometime something will happen where we'll say maybe we'd
better catch up. But that won't happen today,'' Bean said.
   Bean, who walked on the moon on <DATE>Nov. 19, 1969</DATE>, and later flew
aboard Skylab 3 for 59 days in <DATE>1973</DATE>, said he didn't want to see
another 1960s-style space race.
   ``I'd rather have space cooperation. I'd think that would be much
better for the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>,'' he said.

   The Apollo 11 astronauts kick off a
weeklong celebration <DATE>Saturday</DATE> to commemorate the 20th anniversary of
man's landing on the moon, beginning at the site where their lunar
rocket was designed.
   They will take part in ceremonies and parties at three <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> space
centers and with President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> in the nation's capital.
   <PERSON>Neil Armstrong</PERSON> and <PERSON>Buzz Aldrin</PERSON> left the first footprints on the
lunar surface on <DATE>July 20, 1969</DATE>, while <PERSON>Mike Collins</PERSON> circled overhead
in the command ship.
   The three will start their anniversary trip <DATE>Saturday</DATE> at the
<ORGANIZATION>Marshall Space Flight Center</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Huntsville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ala.</LOCATION>, where the giant
<ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> 5 rocket that propelled them to the moon was designed and
tested.
   There they will meet with rocket pioneers and attend a reception
and an open house concert where the landing on the moon's <ORGANIZATION>Sea of
Tranquillity</ORGANIZATION> will be re-created by actors on a stage.
   The astronauts will be at the <ORGANIZATION>Kennedy Space Center</ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION>Cape
Canaveral</LOCATION> on <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, the launch's anniversary. Against a backdrop of
an unused <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> 5, now a museum piece, they will make brief remarks
and listen to a tape recording of the launch commentary in the
minutes before the Apollo 11 liftoff.
   The ``taped liftoff'' will occur at <TIME>9:32 a.m. EDT</TIME>, precisely the
time they left <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   After the ceremony the spacemen will ride in a motorcade that
will travel 20 miles to <LOCATION>Cocoa Beach</LOCATION>, where they will be honored at a
luncheon.
   On <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, they will be in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> for an evening reception
at the <ORGANIZATION>Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum</ORGANIZATION>.
   The next day, the anniversary of the moon landing, <ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION>,
<PERSON>Aldrin</PERSON> and <PERSON>Collins</PERSON> will be joined by President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> for a ceremony
on the <ORGANIZATION>Mall</ORGANIZATION> in front of the museum.
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> is expected to unveil a long-term space plan that could
include strong endorsement of a permanent space station and
proposals for building a lunar research base and sending Americans
to Mars early in the <DATE>21st century</DATE>.
   The astronauts then will fly to the <ORGANIZATION>Johnson Space Center</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION>, site of their Apollo training base and home for the <ORGANIZATION>Mission
Control Center</ORGANIZATION> that directs all <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> manned spaceflights.
   There they will attend a giant reception on <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>
attended by 5,000 or more people who will re-create the infamous
``splashdown parties'' that went on all night after each successful
Apollo mission.
   Next <DATE>Friday</DATE>, they will attend a black tie gala at a <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION>
hotel. The master of ceremonies will be <PERSON>Walter Cronkite</PERSON>, the former
<ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION> anchorman who reported on the mission for his network.

   Twelve men, all Americans, walked on
the moon in those heady days of Apollo exploration. Their fame was
fleeting and their names today are mostly dim memories.
   <PERSON>Neil Armstrong</PERSON> earned a place in history 20 years ago when he
became the first human to leave his footprints in the ancient lunar
dust.
   The rest, in order: <PERSON>Buzz Aldrin</PERSON>, <PERSON>Charles Conrad Jr.</PERSON>, <PERSON>Alan L.

   Each was affected profoundly by his stay on the moon and the
perspective it gave them of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   ``My impression was of the importance of that small, fragile,
remote blue planet,'' <ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION> reported. ``People everywhere have,
by television and photographs, shared that perspective and shared
our concern for the security of our globe.''
   Nine of the moon-walkers are business executives, one is an
artist, one is an evangelist, and one remains with <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>, an

<PERSON>Neil A. Armstrong</PERSON>, who walked into history <DATE>20 years ago July</DATE> as the first man 
on the moon, made a rare public appearance today with his two Apollo 11 crew 
mates and endorsed <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s planned space station. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference to commemorate the <DATE>20th anniversary</DATE> of their historic 
flight, <ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION>, 58, <PERSON>Edwin E.</PERSON> (Buzz) <PERSON>Aldrin</PERSON>, 59, and <PERSON>Michael Collins</PERSON>, 58, 
reminisced about their <DATE>July 16, 1969</DATE>, blastoff atop a mighty <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> 5 rocket 
and the mission that fulfilled President <PERSON>John F. Kennedy</PERSON>'s promise to land men 
on the moon before the end of the <DATE>1960s</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
"Ten years ago, I did make a statement endorsing the concept of a permanent 
presence in space," <ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION> said. "I guess I still feel that's a worthy 
objective. I hope that space station Freedom becomes a reality before we have 
another 10 years go by." 
</P>
<P>
Armstrong was referring to <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s plans to build a permanently manned space 
station in the <DATE>late 1990s</DATE>, a project that is threatened by budget cuts and a 
lack of political support. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mars Mission Endorsed 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Aldrin</PERSON> called for an evolutionary approach to exploring the solar system while 
<PERSON>Collins</PERSON> strongly endorsed a mission to Mars. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this country should set a goal of exploring and setting up on Mars," 
<PERSON>Collins</PERSON> said. "That is the one goal that . . . I think would have a unifying 
and perhaps even an electrifying effect on <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> and our space program." 
</P>
<P>
Armstrong and <PERSON>Aldrin</PERSON> touched down in the <ORGANIZATION>Sea of Tranquility</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>July 20, 1969</DATE>, 
in a spider-like lunar module spacecraft called <ORGANIZATION>Eagle</ORGANIZATION> while <PERSON>Collins</PERSON> orbited 69 
miles overhead in the gumdrop-shaped Apollo command module, <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind," <ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION> said as 
he stepped onto the moon's surface. 
</P>
<P>
While <PERSON>Aldrin</PERSON> and <PERSON>Collins</PERSON> have granted interviews and written books, <ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION>, 
a very private man, has routinely refused to meet the press or make public 
appearances.

   A bash for 10,000 past and present
<ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> employees had the same open bar and mob scene as the parties
that followed Apollo missions 20 years ago.
   The only thing missing was the splashdown.
   ``Then, they threw everybody in the pool,'' said <PERSON>Cookie
Leisenring</PERSON>, a retired <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION>
employee who was trying to take pictures of the honored guests at
<DATE>Thursday</DATE>'s party at the <ORGANIZATION>Johnson Space Center</ORGANIZATION> _ Apollo 11 astronauts
<PERSON>Neil Armstrong</PERSON> and <PERSON>Edwin</PERSON> ``Buzz'' <PERSON>Aldrin</PERSON> and <PERSON>Michael Collins</PERSON>, who
marked the 20th anniversary of the first moonwalk.
   Leisenring recalled with pleasure the informal parties that
followed the Apollo splashdowns of the 60s and 70s.
   ``You knew everybody, the cars were parked on the medians and
you had to work to get up to the bar,'' <PERSON>Mrs. Leisenring</PERSON> said. ``All
the contractors had open bars at the hotels and you just walked up
and tried to make your way to get a drink. The parties were
everywhere.''
   One big party activity _ throwing others into the hotel swimming
pools _ wasn't possible <DATE>Thursday</DATE>. The <ORGANIZATION>Robert R. Gilruth Recreation
Facility</ORGANIZATION> has no pool.
   Separate outdoor areas of the party were designated for
different departments such as engineering and development and
recovery crew. Inside, a band played in a gym-sized room decorated
with star-shaped ballons and blue balloons with the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> flag on
them.
   Beer and soft drinks were free, but partygoers had to pay for
hot dogs.
   The crowds were so dense when the astronauts arrived at the
party that <ORGANIZATION>Space Center</ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON>Aaron Cohen</PERSON> had to board a van
carrying the astronauts to officially greet them. <PERSON>Hans Mark</PERSON>, a
former director, also greeted the astronauts.
   ``Twenty years ago, I sat in mission control when these guys
came down and I wouldn't miss this for the world,'' said <PERSON>Mark</PERSON>, now
the chancellor for the <ORGANIZATION>University of Texas</ORGANIZATION> system.
   Collins, <PERSON>Aldrin</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION>, who earlier <DATE>Thursday</DATE> ate a
barbecue lunch with President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION>, exited the
van to loud cheers and then went separate ways to mingle with the
crowd.
   ``It is exciting to get to see all these guys that figured out
how to go to the moon in the first place,'' said <PERSON>Ken Schultz</PERSON>, an
engineer for <ORGANIZATION>Lockheed Engineering &amp; Science Co</ORGANIZATION>. Inc. ``I'm just
sitting here and going `Wow.'''
   On <DATE>July 20, 1969</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Aldrin</PERSON> planted their footsteps
on the moon while <PERSON>Collins</PERSON> circled above in the spacecraft that
carried the three back to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> proposed <DATE>Thursday</DATE> to establish a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> moon base
early in the next century and then mount a manned Mars mission. His
proposal is likely to ignite a national debate in a budget-minded
<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> and among those who believe federal dollars should not be
spent on costly space endeavors but on solving more earthly
problems.
   After the splashdown party, the three former astronauts attended
a private party at a nearby hotel where they watched a fireworks
display that began at <TIME>9:56 p.m.</TIME> _ the moment <ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION> stepped on
the moon <DATE>two decades ago</DATE>.

<TEXT>
   Nearly half the American astronauts who flew in
space shared a day of memories <DATE>Thursday</DATE> with the president. It was
one small ceremony for man, recalling one giant leap for mankind.
   ``It's hard to believe that 20 years have passed,'' said
President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> of man's first landing on the moon. ``Three days and
three nights they journeyed. It was a perilous, unprecedented,
breathtaking voyage. And each of us remember the night.''
   ``They'' were the men of Apollo 11, which set down on the <ORGANIZATION>Sea of
Tranquillity</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>July 20, 1969</DATE>: <PERSON>Neil Armstrong</PERSON>, <PERSON>Edwin</PERSON> ``Buzz'' <PERSON>Aldrin</PERSON>
and <PERSON>Michael Collins</PERSON>.
   On that day, they were the only human beings away from their
world; on <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, they bathed in the glow of reminiscence outside
the <ORGANIZATION>National Air</ORGANIZATION> and Space Museum only a few feet from the command
module <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION> which carried them to the moon and into the history
books.
   Behind them at the ceremony were models of the 36-story rocket
that lifted them from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and the spindly legged lander that took
<ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Aldrin</PERSON> to the airless moon.
   Eagle, the lander, still is on the moon, a souvenir of the brief
visit that will remain for all eternity, along with the American
flag they planted and the footprints they left.
   <ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION>, the first of 12 Americans who walked the moon, said
the space effort in the <DATE>1960s</DATE> had ``a nobility of purpose ... not to
conquer enemies, but to conquer ignorance.''
   Buzz Aldrin, No. 2 on the moon and now a strong advocate of
proceeding onward to <PERSON>Mars</PERSON> said ``the time for seizing the initiative
in space is upon us.''
   And <PERSON>Michael Collins</PERSON>, who orbited overhead as a lonely lifeguard
while <ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Aldrin</PERSON> pirouetted on the moon, said ``we have
rested on our Apollo laurels long enough; it's time to get moving
again.''
   The president had words for <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>:
   ``For those old enough to remember that historic night 20 years
ago, step outside tonight with your children or your grandchildren.
Lift your eyes skyward, and tell them of the flag _ the American
flag _ that still flies proudly in the ancient lunar soil ...
   ``Project Apollo. The first men on the moon. Some called it
quixotic, impossible _ had never been done. But <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> dreamed it.
And <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> did it.''
   Among the 700 guests at the ceremony were 66 of the 126 Americans
who have gone into space, including 21 of the 30 who flew on Apollo.
   They went for the most part unrecognized: <PERSON>Pete Conrad</PERSON> and <PERSON>Alan
Bean</PERSON>, second on the moon on Apollo 12; <PERSON>Jim Lovell</PERSON> and <PERSON>Fred Haise</PERSON>,
who were going there but didn't make it because of an explosion _
the third man on their Apollo 13 voyage, <PERSON>John Swigert</PERSON> has died.
   There were also <PERSON>Eugene Cernan</PERSON> and <PERSON>Harrison Schmitt</PERSON>, the last on
the moon _ more than 16 years ago.
   In the crowd was <PERSON>Thomas Paine</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> administrator then and
more recently the architect of the plans for <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s future in
space that <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> enunciated <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   ``That was first rate,'' he said of the president's speech. ``A
good beginning.''
   <PERSON>John Young</PERSON>, who made two Apollo flights, called it a great speech
and said he wasn't disturbed that <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> was not specific about time
and costs for the program he envisioned. ``Nobody knows what it will
cost,'' said <PERSON>Young</PERSON>, who also has flown the space shuttle four times,
``if anybody tells you the cost <DATE>today</DATE>, don't believe it.''
   <PERSON>Rusty Schweickart</PERSON>, who was on Apollo 9 _ a moon flight rehearsal
_ said ``Part of the problem of Apollo was it had a single,
wonderful goal but nothing to sustain the momentum.''
   Richard Truly, twice a shuttle astronaut and now head of the
space agency, saw <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s speech as ``dynamite ... a clear road map.''
   In his speech, <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> said he is asking ``my right hand man'', Vice
President <PERSON>Quayle</PERSON> _ chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>National Space Council</ORGANIZATION> _ to
develop realistic timetables and milestones for future exploration
and to report back.
   Quayle, who has been out making pro-space speeches, said that
``when Americans set their minds to acomplish something, we always
exceed our expectations.''
   He addressed the crowd as ``My fellow astronauts.''

<TEXT>
   Twenty years after man walked on the
moon, those responsible for that ``one giant leap for mankind'' said
the space program needs another bold challenge to recapture
<LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s imagination.
   And with <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s imagination, they said, will come the
financial support needed for a daring project, such as landing
astronauts on Mars.
   On <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, a soldout crowd of more than 4,000 people joined the
Apollo 11 crew _ <PERSON>Neil Armstrong</PERSON>, <PERSON>Edwin</PERSON> ``Buzz'' <PERSON>Aldrin</PERSON> and <PERSON>Michael
Collins</PERSON> _ at the <LOCATION>Alabama Space</LOCATION> and Rocket Center for the first of
four celebrations around the country to commemorate the lunar
landing on <DATE>July 20, 1969</DATE>.
   Huntsville's celebration focuses on the role this northern
<LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION> city and the <PERSON>Wernher von Braun</PERSON> rocket team at <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s
<ORGANIZATION>Marshall Space Flight Center</ORGANIZATION> played in developing the <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> V
rocket to propel Apollo 11 on its journey to the moon.
   The celebration was like a high-tech rock concert without the
music. Lasers bounced off rockets exhibited throughout the center,
sound effects simulated the takeoff of the <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> V rocket to the
moon, and actors portrayed <ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION>'s and <PERSON>Aldrin</PERSON>'s walk on the
rugged lunar landscape four days after blasting off from <ORGANIZATION>Kennedy
Space Center</ORGANIZATION>.
   It climaxed with the Apollo 11 crew rising from a cloud of smoke
20 feet into the air to the front of a giant movie screen showing
footage of their travels. The crew was surrounded by a cacophony of
fireworks and dozens of dancing laser beams.
   Aldrin, who spent much of his time in <LOCATION>Huntsville</LOCATION> autographing his
new book ``Men from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>,'' describes the 20th anniversary as
``bittersweet.'' That's because he worries that <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> ``will sink
to second-rate status'' in space if it continues on its present
course.
   The 59-year-old former astronaut said <DATE>Saturday</DATE> he hoped the
anniversary would help <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> set well-defined space objectives
instead of having each space shuttle flight ``being an entity into
itself.''
   ``There is an excitement about the past but there is not an
awareness of where we want to go,'' he said in an interview.
   He envisions the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> working with the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> on space research projects, with a goal of developing
spaceships that will take advantage of planetary movements to
slingshot between Mars and <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> on five-month cycles.
   <PERSON>Collins</PERSON>, 58, also called for greater direction in the space
program.
   ``One of these days, and I hope it's not too long, this country
is going to decide it wants to go to Mars,'' he told a gathering of
engineers who worked on the Apollo project.
   Armstrong, 58, told the same group, ``A machine is man-made and
hence imperfect. No one has ever made a perfect machine. Those of
you who made the <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> V came about as close as history ever
recorded.''
   <PERSON>Jack Lee</PERSON>, director at <ORGANIZATION>Marshall Space Flight Center</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Huntsville</LOCATION>
and a former member of the von <PERSON>Braun</PERSON> team, vividly remembers
President <PERSON>Kennedy</PERSON>'s seemingly impossible challenge to land a man on
the moon by the end of the <DATE>1960s</DATE>.
   No president has issued an equally bold challenge since then, but
he hopes President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> will in a 20th anniversary speech <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   ``We must continue what <PERSON>Wernher von Braun</PERSON> and Apollo 11 started
many years ago, that is to reach out and touch another world,'' he
said. ``This time our launching pad is going to be the space
station.''
   <PERSON>Konrad Dannenberg</PERSON>, a German rocket scientist who came to <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>
with <PERSON>Von Braun</PERSON> after World War II and later supervised engineering
and testing of the <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> rocket, said the moon landing ``was the
biggest step for mankind that has ever taken place. I hope this
(anniversary) is the first step toward an even bigger achievement.''
   <PERSON>Ed Buckbee</PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION>Space and Rocket Center</ORGANIZATION>, a tourist
attraction focused on space achievements, and a former member of <PERSON>Von
Braun</PERSON>'s staff, said he hopes ``President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> gives us a goal. I've
heard everything from a moon colony to a man on <ORGANIZATION>Mars</ORGANIZATION>, with a space
plane in there.''
   Buckbee said he sees only one way for <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> to recapture <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s
imagination and pocketbook.
   ``It's got to be a man on Mars landing,'' he said. ``I don't
think a space station is going to capture American imagination. It's
got to be something that puts man and machine against the hazards of
space.''

The executive producer of a <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION> documentary on man's first walk on the moon in 
<DATE>1969</DATE> said the program mistakenly showed clips taken on the moon during a <DATE>1972</DATE> 
flight. The program said the <DATE>1972</DATE> footage was of the historic first moon walk 
by American astronauts. "It was an honest mistake," <PERSON>Perry Wolff</PERSON> said <DATE>Friday</DATE> of 
the error in "The Moon Above, the Earth Below," a two-hour special that aired 
<DATE>Thursday</DATE> and saluted the 20th anniversary of the historic Apollo 11 moon 
flight. The program was co-anchored by <PERSON>Dan Rather</PERSON> and <PERSON>Charles Kuralt</PERSON>. Two 
scenes showed two astronauts -- ostensibly <PERSON>Neil Armstrong</PERSON> and <PERSON>Buzz Aldrin</PERSON> -- 
bouncing on the moon's surface, and then their lunar orbiter blasting off from 
the moon. In a brief interview, <PERSON>Wolff</PERSON> said he had just learned that they 
actually were from the Apollo 17 flight in <DATE>December, 1972</DATE>. No deception was 
intended, he emphasized. He blamed the error on a "mislabeled tape" taken from 
a box of more than 100 tapes of footage of moon flights and landings. <PERSON>Claudia

   Soviet TV viewers finally got a chance <DATE>Thursday</DATE> to
see what the rest of the world saw 20 years ago: the first steps by
a man on the moon.
   State-run TV featured a lengthy documentary on the Apollo 11
lunar landing by astronauts <PERSON>Neil Armstrong</PERSON> and <PERSON>Buzz Aldrin</PERSON>,
including interviews with <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> scientists.
   On <DATE>July 20, 1969</DATE>, Soviet television ignored the historic landing
that millions around the world witnessed live, and instead broadcast
a musical variety show.
   <DATE>Thursday</DATE>'s 20th anniversary documentary showed footage from the
moonwalk by <ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Aldrin</PERSON>, with the astronauts gathering
samples of moon rocks. The American flag was clearly visible.
   The narrator of the documentary, former Soviet cosmonaut <PERSON>Vitaly
Sevastyanov</PERSON>, translated <ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION>'s famous first words on the moon
into Russian: ``Eto malyenky shag cheloveka, i bolshoi skochok
vsyevo chelovechestva'' _ ``That's one small step for a man, one
giant leap for mankind.''
   <DATE>Thursday</DATE>'s broadcast _ shown on a weekday morning that hardly
guaranteed a wide audience _ followed a <DATE>July 10</DATE> article in Ogonyok
magazine that said it was wrong to hide the moon landing from the
Soviet people. The article also gave a detailed description of the
lunar landing.
   Under President <PERSON>Mikhail S. Gorbachev</PERSON>'s policy of glasnost, or
greater openness, Soviet media have reported on many topics they
once did not cover.
   Soviet TV carried extensive coverage of the linkup of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
Apollo and Soviet Soyez capsules in <DATE>1975</DATE>, but largely ignored the
American program to land a man on the moon.

   <PERSON>Buzz Aldrin</PERSON> laments that ``the
promise of Apollo was never fulfilled,'' that the American space
program languished after he and <PERSON>Neil Armstrong</PERSON> left the first human
footprints on the <DATE>moon two decades ago</DATE>.
   He says he hopes the 20th anniversary of Apollo 11 will ``become
a catalyst for the country to chart a bold course for human
expansion outward.''
   But given today's political and tight budgetary climate, <PERSON>Aldrin</PERSON>
is not too hopeful.
   President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> is expected to voice continuing support for a
permanent manned space station and say other nice things about
<ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s program when he meets with <PERSON>Aldrin</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION> and their
command module pilot, <PERSON>Michael Collins</PERSON>, on <DATE>July 20</DATE>, the anniversary
of the moon landing.
   But no matter how many nice things the president says about
space, the political truth is that <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> must approve the money.
And with the space station already facing a sharp funding cut,
<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> is not expected to give much support to new projects.
   So the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION> once again
is at a crossroads, as it was when the glory days of Apollo ended.
   President <PERSON>John F. Kennedy</PERSON> had committed this nation to landing a
man on the moon in the <DATE>1960s</DATE>. The goal was to gain space superiority
over the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>, whose early feats had earned the Russians
worldwide respect and shocked Americans.
   When the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> won the race to the moon, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> laid out
bold plans for the future.
   To a presidential panel, agency head <PERSON>Thomas Paine</PERSON> in <DATE>1969</DATE>
proposed a 12-man space station and a reusable space shuttle in
operation as early as <DATE>1976</DATE>, followed by a station in moon orbit, a
base on the moon, a 50-man space station in <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> orbit and a manned
mission to <ORGANIZATION>Mars</ORGANIZATION> in the <DATE>1980s</DATE>.
   But in a period of unrest due to domestic racial problems and
involvement in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>, costly plans to explore space were given low
priority.
   Only the reuseable space shuttle survived, and its proposed
funding was cut deeply.
   ``Those were tough times,'' said <PERSON>Paine</PERSON>, who resigned in
frustration a year after Apollo 11.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Carter</PERSON> administrations were lukewarm toward the
space program, but the shuttle was built. It performed capably as a
space truck for 24 missions until <DATE>Jan. 28, 1986</DATE>, when the Challenger
exploded, killing its seven crew members and grounding the program
for 32 months.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> had gained some hope from President <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>'s endorsement of
a strong space program and from his <DATE>1984</DATE> State of the <ORGANIZATION>Union</ORGANIZATION> message,
in which he backed building the space station Freedom.
   In <DATE>1985</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> created a commission to define long-term space
goals. Its chief was <PERSON>Thomas Paine</PERSON>, the former <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> administrator.
   Six months after Challenger, <PERSON>Paine</PERSON> stood in the <ORGANIZATION>Oval Office</ORGANIZATION> and
gave <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> a slick leather-bound volume that recommended the space
station, a lunar base and manned trips to Mars _ essentially an
update of <ORGANIZATION>Paine</ORGANIZATION>'s <DATE>1969</DATE> plan.
   Reagan <DATE>two years later</DATE> signed a Presidential Directive on
<ORGANIZATION>National Space Policy</ORGANIZATION> that stated space leadership was a fundamental
objective. It endorsed the space station and, without being
specific, set a long-range goal ``to expand human presence and
activity beyond <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> orbit into the solar system.''
   <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>'s policy set in motion a <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> program named Pathfinder
whose goal is to test technologies for manned and robotic
exploration of the moon and planets, advanced missions in orbit and
on planetary surfaces, extended human presence in space, and space
transportation to the moon and planets.
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> has not disclosed his thinking beyond saying he supports a
space station. He established the <ORGANIZATION>National Space Council</ORGANIZATION>, headed by
Vice President <PERSON>Dan Quayle</PERSON>, to recommend a comprehensive space policy.
   Quayle is expected to have a preliminary outline ready for <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s
anniversary meeting with the Apollo 11 astronauts.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> needs a decision from <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> soon on how much money it can
spend next year on space station Freedom. A permanent orbiting space
station is essential to those ambitious Pathfinder dreams and would
serve as a training base and launch pad for flights deeper into
space.
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> has requested <MONEY>$2.05 billion</MONEY> in the budget for fiscal <DATE>1990</DATE> to
continue work on the station. Predictions are that <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> will
trim that by <MONEY>$400 million</MONEY> to <MONEY>$700 million</MONEY>, amounts that space
officials say could further delay or even kill the project.
   The space station project has gone through five tumultuous years.
Reagan wanted it built in cooperation with <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s major allies,
but there were stormy sessions over access to the station before 10
European nations, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> agreed to invest nearly <MONEY>$8
billion</MONEY> to build sections of it.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> said in <DATE>1984</DATE> it could begin launching segments of the
orbiting laboratory in <DATE>1992</DATE> and estimated the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> cost at <MONEY>$8
billion</MONEY>. In <DATE>1987</DATE>, agency officials revised the pricetag to <MONEY>$14.6
billion</MONEY>. The new figure covered a suddenly scaled-down Phase One,
which left off two of the external struts to which experiment
modules would be attached. The struts would be added in orbit under
Phase Two.
   Shortly after that, a <ORGANIZATION>National Research Council</ORGANIZATION> panel reviewing
station costs and technical issues for the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> said the
total cost to develop and deploy the first phase would be <MONEY>$25.02
billion</MONEY>, with Phase Two raising the cost to <MONEY>$32.8 billion</MONEY>.
   The schedule began slipping. And <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> now says if it receives the
proper funding, it could begin assembling the station in <DATE>1995</DATE>.
   Some in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> believe <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> should alter its plans and build a
less complex station and, instead of relying totally on the space
shuttle, develop a large unmanned rocket to do much of the lifting
job.
   Orbiting at 250 miles, Freedom would be home to a crew of eight,
with astronauts rotating back to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> after four to six months.
   The station would allow humans to study the stars and planets
from the pollution-free environment of space. The weightless
interior would permit manufacture of new, contamination-free
medicines and other products impossible to create on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
Astronauts would assemble, service and repair satellites and send
them out into space. And the station could eventually be the staging
point for man's return to the moon or a journey to Mars.
   No one can predict whether these grand plans will come about, but
the three astronauts who made that extraordinary Apollo 11 flight to
the <DATE>moon 20 years ago</DATE> think they should.
   ``A permanent presence in space is a worthy objective, and I hope
that space station Freedom becomes a reality,'' <PERSON>Neil Armstrong</PERSON> said
recently.
   ``I strongly endorse the station, a scientific base on the moon
and eventually manned flights to Mars,'' said <PERSON>Buzz Aldrin</PERSON>.
   <PERSON>Michael Collins</PERSON>, who orbited the moon while <ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Aldrin</PERSON>
walked its surface, envisioned setting up a colony on Mars.
   ``We're a nation of explorers,'' he said. ``We started on the
<LOCATION>East Coast</LOCATION>, we went to the <LOCATION>West Coast</LOCATION>, and then vertically. Starting

   <PERSON>Buzz Aldrin</PERSON> laments that ``the
promise of Apollo was never fulfilled,'' that the American space
program languished after he and <PERSON>Neil Armstrong</PERSON> left the first human
footprints on the <DATE>moon two decades ago</DATE>.
   He says he hopes the 20th anniversary of Apollo 11 will ``become
a catalyst for the country to chart a bold course for human
expansion outward.''
   But given today's political and tight budgetary climate, <PERSON>Aldrin</PERSON>
is not too hopeful.
   President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> is expected to voice continuing support for a
permanent manned space station and say other nice things about
<ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s program when he meets with <PERSON>Aldrin</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION> and their
command module pilot, <PERSON>Michael Collins</PERSON>, on <DATE>July 20</DATE>, the anniversary
of the moon landing.
   But no matter how many nice things the president says about
space, the political truth is that <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> must approve the money.
And with the space station already facing a sharp funding cut,
<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> is not expected to give much support to new projects.
   So the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION> once again
is at a crossroads, as it was when the glory days of Apollo ended.
   President <PERSON>John F. Kennedy</PERSON> had committed this nation to landing a
man on the moon in the <DATE>1960s</DATE>. The goal was to gain space superiority
over the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>, whose early feats had earned the Russians
worldwide respect and shocked Americans.
   When the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> won the race to the moon, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> laid out
bold plans for the future.
   To a presidential panel, agency head <PERSON>Thomas Paine</PERSON> in <DATE>1969</DATE>
proposed a 12-man space station and a reusable space shuttle in
operation as early as <DATE>1976</DATE>, followed by a station in moon orbit, a
base on the moon, a 50-man space station in <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> orbit and a manned
mission to <ORGANIZATION>Mars</ORGANIZATION> in the <DATE>1980s</DATE>.
   But in a period of unrest due to domestic racial problems and
involvement in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>, costly plans to explore space were given low
priority.
   Only the reuseable space shuttle survived, and its proposed
funding was cut deeply.
   ``Those were tough times,'' said <PERSON>Paine</PERSON>, who resigned in
frustration a year after Apollo 11.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Carter</PERSON> administrations were lukewarm toward the
space program, but the shuttle was built. It performed capably as a
space truck for 24 missions until <DATE>Jan. 28, 1986</DATE>, when the Challenger
exploded, killing its seven crew members and grounding the program
for 32 months.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> had gained some hope from President <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>'s endorsement of
a strong space program and from his <DATE>1984</DATE> State of the <ORGANIZATION>Union</ORGANIZATION> message,
in which he backed building the space station Freedom.
   In <DATE>1985</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> created a commission to define long-term space
goals. Its chief was <PERSON>Thomas Paine</PERSON>, the former <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> administrator.
   Six months after Challenger, <PERSON>Paine</PERSON> stood in the <ORGANIZATION>Oval Office</ORGANIZATION> and
gave <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> a slick leather-bound volume that recommended the space
station, a lunar base and manned trips to Mars _ essentially an
update of <ORGANIZATION>Paine</ORGANIZATION>'s <DATE>1969</DATE> plan.
   Reagan <DATE>two years later</DATE> signed a Presidential Directive on
<ORGANIZATION>National Space Policy</ORGANIZATION> that stated space leadership was a fundamental
objective. It endorsed the space station and, without being
specific, set a long-range goal ``to expand human presence and
activity beyond <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> orbit into the solar system.''
   <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>'s policy set in motion a <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> program named Pathfinder
whose goal is to test technologies for manned and robotic
exploration of the moon and planets, advanced missions in orbit and
on planetary surfaces, extended human presence in space, and space
transportation to the moon and planets.
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> has not disclosed his thinking beyond saying he supports a
space station. He established the <ORGANIZATION>National Space Council</ORGANIZATION>, headed by
Vice President <PERSON>Dan Quayle</PERSON>, to recommend a comprehensive space policy.
   Quayle is expected to have a preliminary outline ready for <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s
anniversary meeting with the Apollo 11 astronauts.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> needs a decision from <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> soon on how much money it can
spend next year on space station Freedom. A permanent orbiting space
station is essential to those ambitious Pathfinder dreams and would
serve as a training base and launch pad for flights deeper into
space.
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> has requested <MONEY>$2.05 billion</MONEY> in the budget for fiscal <DATE>1990</DATE> to
continue work on the station. Predictions are that <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> will
trim that by <MONEY>$400 million</MONEY> to <MONEY>$700 million</MONEY>, amounts that space
officials say could further delay or even kill the project.
   The space station project has gone through five tumultuous years.
Reagan wanted it built in cooperation with <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s major allies,
but there were stormy sessions over access to the station before 10
European nations, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> agreed to invest nearly <MONEY>$8
billion</MONEY> to build sections of it.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> said in <DATE>1984</DATE> it could begin launching segments of the
orbiting laboratory in <DATE>1992</DATE> and estimated the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> cost at <MONEY>$8
billion</MONEY>. In <DATE>1987</DATE>, agency officials revised the pricetag to <MONEY>$14.6
billion</MONEY>. The new figure covered a suddenly scaled-down Phase One,
which left off two of the external struts to which experiment
modules would be attached. The struts would be added in orbit under
Phase Two.
   Shortly after that, a <ORGANIZATION>National Research Council</ORGANIZATION> panel reviewing
station costs and technical issues for the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> said the
total cost to develop and deploy the first phase would be <MONEY>$25.02
billion</MONEY>, with Phase Two raising the cost to <MONEY>$32.8 billion</MONEY>.
   The schedule began slipping. And <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> now says if it receives the
proper funding, it could begin assembling the station in <DATE>1995</DATE>.
   Some in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> believe <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> should alter its plans and build a
less complex station and, instead of relying totally on the space
shuttle, develop a large unmanned rocket to do much of the lifting
job.
   Orbiting at 250 miles, Freedom would be home to a crew of eight,
with astronauts rotating back to <ORGANIZATION>Earh</ORGANIZATION> after four to six months.
   The station would allow humans to study the stars and planets
from the pollution-free environment of space. The weightless
interior would permit manufacture of new, contamination-free
medicines and other products impossible to create on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
Astronauts would assemble, service and repair satellites and send
them out into space. And the station could eventually be the staging
point for man's return to the moon or a journey to Mars.
   No one can predict whether these grand plans will come about, but
the three astronauts who made that extraordinary Apollo 11 flight to
the <DATE>moon 20 years ago</DATE> think they should.
   ``A permanent presence in space is a worthy objective, and I hope
that space station Freedom becomes a reality,'' <PERSON>Neil Armstrong</PERSON> said
recently.
   ``I strongly endorse the station, a scientific base on the moon
and eventually manned flights to Mars,'' said <PERSON>Buzz Aldrin</PERSON>.
   <PERSON>Michael Collins</PERSON>, who orbited the moon while <ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Aldrin</PERSON>
walked its surface, envisioned setting up a colony on Mars.
   ``We're a nation of explorers,'' he said. ``We started on the
<LOCATION>East Coast</LOCATION>, we went to the <LOCATION>West Coast</LOCATION>, and then vertically. Starting
with the <PERSON>Wright</PERSON> brothers, <PERSON>Chuck Yeager</PERSON> through the sound barrier,
<ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION> and Aldrin on the moon.
   ``It's in our tradition, it's in our culture.''

   Here are highlights of events on the
Apollo 11 moon flight <DATE>20 years ago today</DATE>:
   As Apollo 11 coasted smoothly toward the moon, astronauts <PERSON>Neil
Armstrong</PERSON> and <PERSON>Buzz Aldrin</PERSON> left <PERSON>Mike Collins</PERSON> alone in the command
module <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION> and crawled through a connecting tunnel to enter the
lunar module <ORGANIZATION>Eagle</ORGANIZATION>. With earthlings watching on television,
<ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Aldrin</PERSON> inspected the craft and checked switch settings
to make certain nothing had been disturbed or damaged by buffeting
at the time of launch. They reported the lunar ship was in good
shape.
   At <TIME>11:32 p.m. EDT</TIME>, the astronauts passed through an area called
the equigravisphere, a ``twilight zone'' in which the gravitational
influence of the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and moon is about equal. Once through this
zone, the moon won the gravitational tug-of-war and Apollo 11 was in
the grip of lunar gravity. The ship passed through this invisible
barrier when it was 43,495 miles from the moon and 214,402 miles
from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.

   The fourth man to walk on the moon
doesn't expect more moon walks soon because of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s complacency
toward space discovery.
   Apollo 12 astronaut <PERSON>Alan Bean</PERSON>, 57, said <DATE>Sunday</DATE> he doubted that
bold space initiatives would arise out of the 20th anniversary of
the Apollo 11 mission, which put the first man on the moon.
   But Bean, speaking at <LOCATION>Huntsville</LOCATION>'s Space Celebration <DATE>'89</DATE>, said
that doesn't bother him.
   ``It's Americans' way to go hard at a goal, then stand back and
savor that and not go hard at it all the time,'' he said. ``Back in
the days of Apollo, I thought we would have done much more by now.
But I didn't stop and think _ that is not the American way.''
   Bean, who walked on the moon on <DATE>Nov. 19, 1969</DATE>, flew aboard Skylab
3 for 59 days in <DATE>1973</DATE> and has trained astronauts, spoke a day after
Apollo 11 astronaut <PERSON>Edwin</PERSON> ``Buzz'' <PERSON>Aldrin</PERSON> addressed the <LOCATION>Huntsville</LOCATION>
celebration.
   Aldrin had called for putting men on Mars within 20 years.
   ``I hope it's as fast as <ORGANIZATION>Buzz</ORGANIZATION> is talking about it,'' Bean said.
But he doubts it.
   ``People feel right now, that even though we are not No. 1 in the
world in space .. that if we really wanted to be and really made an
all-out effort like we did with Apollo, we could be No. 1,'' said
Bean, who noted specifically that Soviet endurance experiments in
space had far outstripped <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> efforts.
   Until the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> decides to put a man on the moon or take
some other pride-threatening step, Bean expects little change in
Americans' attitudes.
   ``Sometime something will happen where we'll say maybe we'd
better catch up. But that won't happen today,'' Bean said.
   When that day comes, Bean hopes for space cooperation between the
<LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>.
   ``I'd think that would be much better for the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>,'' said Bean,
who is retired in <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION> and spends his time painting space scenes.

   ``That's one small step for a man,
one giant leap for mankind.''
   Twenty years have passed, nearly a generation, since <PERSON>Neil
Armstrong</PERSON> called those momentous words down from the moon.
   Two decades since Earthlings watched those flickering television
images, saw that tentative first step on the dusty surface and
looked on in wonder as two Americans hopped about in weak gravity,
planted and saluted their flag, picked up bits of lunar treasure and
spoke with their president a quarter million miles away.
   Most people living then can tell you today where they were when
astronauts <PERSON>Neil Armstrong</PERSON> and <PERSON>Buzz Aldrin</PERSON> took those first steps on
the moon <DATE>Sunday, July 20, 1969</DATE>.
   They were realizing a goal that <PERSON>John F. Kennedy</PERSON> had set in
frustration and desperation.
   Kennedy came to office in <DATE>January 1961</DATE> with a pledge to ``get
this country moving again.'' The economy was sluggish, <PERSON>Fidel Castro</PERSON>
had taken over <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION>, and the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> trailed the Soviets in
the highly visible arena of space.
   The space chasm widened <DATE>April 12, 1961</DATE>, when Soviet cosmonaut
<PERSON>Yuri A. Gagarin</PERSON> blasted into orbit, the first man to fly in space.
   American prestige was rocked again <DATE>five days later</DATE>. On <DATE>April 17</DATE>,
a brigade of Cuban exiles, sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION>Central Intelligence
Agency</ORGANIZATION>, stormed the beach at <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Bay of Pigs</LOCATION> in an effort to
overthrow <PERSON>Castro</PERSON>. His forces routed the ill-equipped exiles, leaving
the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and its young president in shame and disarray.
   Kennedy accepted the blame and decided bold action was needed to
restore <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s honor. Space was the answer, he concluded, and he
gave Vice President <PERSON>Lyndon Johnson</PERSON> the task of determining what
could be done.
   On <DATE>April 28</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Council</ORGANIZATION>, which
<PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> chaired, submitted a preliminary report to the president.
``The moon is a good target for us,'' it said.
   Even as the president and his advisers were discussing moon
trips, some in the administration were concerned about the first
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> man-in-space flight, now set for <DATE>May 2</DATE>. With everything going
wrong for the nation, the impact of a failure could be devastating.
   But <PERSON>Kennedy</PERSON> let the launch date stand, and, on <DATE>May 5</DATE>, after a
three-day weather delay, astronaut <PERSON>Alan Shepard</PERSON> rode a slender
Redstone rocket and a cramped Mercury capsule 115 miles up and 302
miles down the <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> tracking range on a 15-minute suborbital
flight.
   America heaved a sigh of relief. The Soviets were still ahead,
but the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> was on the move.
   On <DATE>May 25</DATE>, four months after taking office, <PERSON>Kennedy</PERSON> delivered a
special <ORGANIZATION>State of the Union</ORGANIZATION> message on urgent national needs. It
covered many subjects, from the economy to disarmament. It also
dealt with space.
   ``I believe this nation should commit itself to achieving the
goal, before the decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and
returning him safely to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. No single space project in this
period will be more impressive to mankind, or more important to the
long-range exploration of space; and none will be so difficult or
expensive to accomplish.''
   The project was called Apollo _ after the Greek archer-god, the
god of light and truth, bright-shining, far-shooting.
   <PERSON>Christopher C. Kraft Jr.</PERSON>, who would become flight operations
director for Apollo, was a <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> engineer working on the Mercury
project.
   ``I thought he had lost his mind,'' <PERSON>Kraft</PERSON> said of <LOCATION>Kennedy</LOCATION> and his
bold commitment. ``We had a total of 15 minutes of manned
spaceflight experience, we hadn't flown <ORGANIZATION>Mercury</ORGANIZATION> in orbit yet, and
here's a guy telling me we're going to fly to the moon. ... Doing it
was one thing, but doing it in this decade was to me too risky.''
   Despite the doubts of <PERSON>Kraft</PERSON> and others within <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s
biggest, costliest and most ambitious technological effort began
with virtually no dissent. Before it was achieved, more than 20,000
industrial contractors and 420,000 technicians, engineers and other
skilled persons would be involved.
   While the hardware of Apollo was being developed and tested,
Americans and Russians were learning to live and work in space and
to perfect the rockets, spaceships and techniques for going to the
moon.
   To a watching world, it was like a relay race in space. The
Russians, with their larger booster rockets and larger manned
spacecraft, held the early lead.
   <PERSON>John Glenn</PERSON> in <DATE>1962</DATE> was hailed as <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s first orbital
champion. Three more Mercury orbital flights proved man could
survive and function for at least a short time in weightless space.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> moved on in <DATE>1965</DATE> to the two-man Gemini program, and 10
exciting flights in 20 months tested and proved all the rendezvous
and docking and space walking procedures needed to travel to the
moon.
   The Russians, too, were perfecting these techniques. But by early
<DATE>1967</DATE>, as the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> was ready to move into manned Apollo
flights, <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> seemed to have a slight lead, based on superior
computer and other technologies.
   Then, tragedy.
   In a countdown test on <DATE>Jan. 27, 1967</DATE>, a month before the planned
launch, faulty wiring released a spark that touched off an inferno
inside the Apollo 1 cabin. The flames, intensified by the 100
percent oxygen environment, incinerated the three-man crew, <PERSON>Gus
Grissom</PERSON>, <PERSON>Ed White</PERSON> and <PERSON>Roger Chaffee</PERSON>.
   Three months after the Apollo fire, cosmonaut <PERSON>Vladimir Komarov</PERSON>
rode into orbit in a new spacecraft named Soyuz, believed to be a
test model for a lunar command ship. After a day in orbit, as he
returned to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, Soyuz 1 tumbled, became tangled in its parachute
straps and crashed. Komarov became the world's first in-flight space
casualty.
   In both countries, critics brought their guns to bear on both
space programs. Each was halted for nearly two years while repairs
were made.
   Apollo was reexamined, rewired, redesigned and finally flew.
Apollo 7 orbited the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> for 11 days in <DATE>October 1968</DATE>, and then, in
a bold move, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> officials decided to fly the three-man Apollo 8
crew into orbit about the moon on <DATE>Christmas Eve 1968</DATE>.
   They reasoned the flight would provide vital information about
navigating to and around the moon, buy time while the lagging lunar
landing module was readied, and rob the Soviets of any glory they
might reap by looping one man once around the backside of the moon
on a translunar trajectory; there was a widely reported rumor that
the Soviets were ready to do just that.
   The mission was a huge, uplifting success, and two more flights,
one in which two astronauts swooped to within 10 miles of the lunar
surface, set the stage for the main event, Apollo 11.
   More than 1 million people _ tourists, congressmen, diplomats,
business people, reporters and movie stars _ came to watch the
launch at the <ORGANIZATION>Kennedy Space Center</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>July 16, 1969</DATE>. All eyes stared
at the sheet of flame as the mighty <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> 5 rose ponderously from
Launch Pad 39A, precisely on schedule at <TIME>9:32 a.m.</TIME>, and sent a
thunderclap across the scrubland.
   In the spaceship on the tip of the rocket were <PERSON>Neil Alden
Armstrong</PERSON>, 38, a civilian, the commander; <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> Col. <PERSON>Edwin
Eugene Aldrin Jr.</PERSON>, 39, the lunar module pilot, and <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> Lt.
Col. <PERSON>Michael Collins</PERSON>, 38, the command module pilot _ ambassadors
from planet <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> headed for a target 250,801 miles away.

   Space shuttle <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION> moved to the
launch pad <DATE>Saturday</DATE> as workers got set to celebrate the <DATE>20th
anniversary</DATE> of the liftoff of another spaceship with the same name,
the one that carried the first men to the moon.
   The shuttle completed a seven-hour trip to launch pad 39B shortly
before <TIME>5 a.m.</TIME>, and engineers and technicians began readying it for
an early <DATE>August</DATE> flight with five astronauts who are to release a
secret military spy satellite. Meanwhile, others made preparations
for <DATE>Sunday</DATE>'s commemoration of the flight of the first <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION>.
   It was <DATE>July 16, 1969</DATE>, that an Apollo command module <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION>
blasted away from the <ORGANIZATION>Kennedy Space Center</ORGANIZATION> here with astronauts <PERSON>Neil
Armstrong</PERSON>, <PERSON>Edwin</PERSON> ``Buzz'' <PERSON>Aldrin</PERSON> and <PERSON>Michael Collins</PERSON>. Four days
later, <ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION> and Aldrin climbed into the lunar landing vehicle
Eagle and descended to the moon.
   After an historic 22 hours on the surface, the moonwalkers
rejoined <PERSON>Collins</PERSON> in mother ship <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION> for the three-day trip home.
   The three were at the <ORGANIZATION>Marshall Space Flight Center</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Huntsville</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Ala.</LOCATION>, on <DATE>Saturday</DATE> for a ceremony there before coming here here to
join with thousands <DATE>Sunday</DATE> in remembering the launch of the Apollo
11 mission.
   Outside the giant shuttle assembly building, where Apollo's
Saturn 5 rockets once were put together, the former astronauts will
make brief remarks and listen to a tape recording of the final
minutes of their countdown.
   The ``taped liftoff'' will occur at <TIME>9:32 a.m.</TIME> <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, precisely
the time they left <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   As the shuttle <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION> moved to the pad, shuttle launch director
<PERSON>Bob Sieck</PERSON> looked back at its namesake.
   ``Twenty years ago there was another spaceship, also called
<ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION>, and it was out at the pad,'' he said. ``It had an
important mission and an important payload. This parallels it.
Shuttle <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION> also has an important mission and an important
payload.
   ``It also will prove we have three orbiters, and that is
significant,'' <PERSON>Sieck</PERSON> said.
   <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION> will be making its first flight since the Challenger
explosion 3{ years ago. The other two shuttles, Discovery and
Atlantis, each have been launched twice since flights resumed <DATE>last
September</DATE>.
   After the ceremony here <DATE>Sunday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME>, <ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Aldrin</PERSON> and
<PERSON>Collins</PERSON> will ride 20 miles in a motorcade to <LOCATION>Cocoa Beach</LOCATION>, where they
will be honored at a luncheon. On <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, the 20th anniversary of
the moon landing, the trio will join President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> for a ceremony
at the <ORGANIZATION>National Air and Space Museum</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> earlier had set <DATE>July 31</DATE> as the date for launching shuttle
<ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION>. But agency officials said <DATE>Thursday</DATE> that preparations were
behind schedule and that a liftoff now is expected during the first
week in <DATE>August</DATE>. A firm launch date will be set <DATE>July 26</DATE> following a
two-day meeting called a flight readiness review.
   <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION>'s all-military crew is to deploy a classified <ORGANIZATION>Defense
Department</ORGANIZATION> payload believed to be an advanced reconnaissance
satellite.
   While the counterparts from <DATE>1969</DATE> are being honored, the shuttle
astronauts will fly here <DATE>Sunday</DATE> from <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION>, in preparation for
some practice sessions <DATE>Monday</DATE> and <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
   The crew is commanded by <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> Col. <PERSON>Brewster H. Shaw Jr</PERSON>. The

   Here are day-to-day highlights of
events on the Apollo 11 moon flight <DATE>20 years ago this week</DATE>:
   
   <DATE>Saturday, July 19, 1969</DATE>:
   Apollo 11 raced into the shadow of the moon and the astronauts
reported a spectacular first sighting of their destination.
Armstrong described a brilliant solar corona as the moon eclipsed
all but the halo of gases surrounding the sun. ``It looks like an

   The spaceship slipped behind the backside of the moon, and
<PERSON>Collins</PERSON> fired the main engine for 5 minutes, 57 seconds to slow
their speed from 5,465 mph to 3,726 mph, settling into an orbit
ranging from 70 to 196 miles above the surface. Later, they
triggered the engine again to achieve a more circular path with a
low point of 62 miles and high point of 75 miles.

<HEAD>Neil Armstrong Disappointed No Man Has Walked on Mars</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SYDNEY RUBIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Twenty years after <PERSON>Neil A. Armstrong</PERSON> made his
``giant leap for mankind'' on the moon, he and his fellow Apollo 11
astronauts said <DATE>Friday</DATE> they are disappointed man has not taken even
one small step on Mars.
   ``I thought the moon would lead immediately and logically to
Mars,'' said <PERSON>Michael Collins</PERSON>, the astronaut who remained in the
spacecraft <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION> circling the moon while <ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Edwin</PERSON>
``Buzz'' <PERSON>Aldrin</PERSON> set down on the <ORGANIZATION>Sea of Tranquility</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>July 20, 1969</DATE>.
   Millions of television viewers watched the heady culmination of a
bold challenge issued in <DATE>1961</DATE> by President <PERSON>John F. Kennedy</PERSON> to land
an American on the moon by the end of the decade.
   Speaking to a jammed news conference at the <ORGANIZATION>Paris Air Show</ORGANIZATION>, the
three gray-haired astronauts used the anniversary to renew the
challenge for Americans to expand the human presence in the solar
system.
   Also on <DATE>Friday</DATE>, Soviet pilot <PERSON>Anatoly Kvochur</PERSON> was discharged from
the hospital after being treated for injuries he suffered on
<DATE>Thursday</DATE> when he ejected from his MiG-29 fighter seconds before it
exploded at the air show.
   No one else was injured when the jet stalled during a performance
before reporters and exhibitors, and crashed in the center of the
field at Le Bourget airport. The cause was being investigated.
   At the news conference, <PERSON>Aldrin</PERSON> said it was competition from the
<LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> in the early <DATE>1960s</DATE> that spawned the leap into space,
and that no similar urgency exists today.
   Armstrong, who commanded the Apollo 11 mission, said: ``We all
started much before <DATE>1969</DATE> and at the time, most people did not
believe there would ever be people in space in our lifetime. In that
sense I'm very encouraged that we did more than most people,
including myself, would have guessed 30 years ago.''
   ``Having said that and knowing now that we were able to break the
chains of gravity, those of us who are involved are always
disappointed that we are not doing more and doing more faster.''
   Collins added: ``I think of the moon not so much as a place these
days than as of a direction, a direction out there, a small way
station on the way to Mars or the outer planets beyond our solar
system.''
   In an interview earlier, <PERSON>Aldrin</PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> planners only recently
considered seriously a proposal he made in <DATE>1985</DATE> for a ``cycling
spaceship.''
   Two spaceships would orbit the sun in a two-year cycle, passing
Mars on the outbound leg and then circling back to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   The spaceships could serve as permanent transport to and from
Mars with ``stripped-down space ferries shuttling men and materials
back and forth to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON>Aldrin</PERSON>, whose book ``Men From
Earth'' was published in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> <DATE>last month</DATE>.
   ``I hope the spaceships will become an increasingly pursued means
of getting to Mars,'' said <PERSON>Aldrin</PERSON>, who lives in <LOCATION>Laguna Beach</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif</LOCATION>.
   ``I expect we'll be back on the moon by <DATE>2005</DATE> and then by <DATE>2010</DATE> we
should be sending people to Mars,'' he said.
   The three astronauts said they did not expect to set foot on
Mars, but that the moon still holds allure.
   ``I look forward to the day when there is commercial service and
I have a chance to go back,'' <PERSON>Armstrong</PERSON> said.

<HEAD>100 Feet in 10 Seconds Equal How Many Slices of Bread?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The problem, as posed to 150,000 school
children on <DATE>Friday</DATE>, was this:
   A student, running 100 feet every 10 seconds, 24 hours a day,
requires 1,467 days to reach the moon. He or she burns 864 calories
an hour. A slice of bread contains 60 calories. How high would the
loaf of bread have to be to supply the student with enough energy
to reach the moon?
   Okay, okay. Something is left out of the problem. A sandwich
slice is about one-half inch thick. The answer is, 30,419,712
calories are represented in 506,995 slices of bread which stacked
would be 253,498 inches high, creating a loaf of bread four miles
high.
   Oh, yes. The moon averages about 240,000 miles away, though you
didn't have to know that to solve the problem.
   This problem was one of five presented on a satellite network
connecting 900 schools around the country to spark youngsters'
interest in learning and to spur appreciation science, math, and
teaching.
   It was the first of such classroom lessons sponsored by the
<ORGANIZATION>Challenger Center</ORGANIZATION>, an educational project founded by the families
of the seven astronauts who perished aboard the space shuttle
Challenger four years ago.
   ``Today, we took you on an imaginary trip to the moon,'' said
<PERSON>Dr. R. Lynn Bondurant Jr.</PERSON>, chief of educational services at <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s
<ORGANIZATION>Lewis Research Center</ORGANIZATION> who conducted the program. ``Some day you may
be on a real trip to the moon ... Remember to reach for the stars.''
   Teachers in the participating classes received matterials in
advance. The preparation showed as pupils afterward asked questions
of <PERSON>Michael Collins</PERSON>, who flew the mother ship while astronauts <PERSON>Neil
Armstrong</PERSON> and <PERSON>Buzz Aldrin</PERSON> made the walk on the moon in <DATE>1969</DATE>.
   What impresses you most from that far away from home?
   ``The size of the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON>Collins</PERSON>. ``First you have to
find it. It is as small as your thumbnail.''
   What supplies should you take?
   ``Hydrogen,'' said <PERSON>Collins</PERSON>. Human beings need water, which is
two parts hydrogen and one part oxygen. ``You can get a lot of
oxygen out of the rocks on the moon, but you have to take hydrogen
from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.''
   How long will the footprints left on the moon last?
   ``I don't know,'' said <PERSON>Collins</PERSON>. Eventually, he said, they would
be obliterated by micrometeorites hitting the moon.
   <DATE>Friday</DATE>'s lessons included calculations to find the distance to
the moon, evaluating the differences in gravity, mapping the moon,
and the <PERSON>Collins</PERSON> interview.
   In the next few weeks the student will work on designing a lunar
mining base and one plan from each school will be submitted to the
Challenger center.
   For the gravity calculations, the students were shown a clip in
which astronaut <PERSON>David Scott</PERSON>, on Apollo 15, dropped a hammer and
feather simultaneously to the moon and they hit the surface at
exactly the same time.
   What they weren't asked to calculate was one of the space age's
most enduring mysteries. How far did the golf ball that <PERSON>Alan
Shepard</PERSON> hit on the moon during the Apollo 14 mission travel in the
one-sixth gravity and no atmosphere to slow it down?

<TEXT>
   America's first astronaut in the <DATE>1960s</DATE>
space race with the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> opposes joint missions today, but
not for political reasons.
   ``I think it would be a step backwards to go that route,'' <PERSON>Alan
Shepard</PERSON> said <DATE>Monday</DATE> during a visit to the Space and <ORGANIZATION>Rocket Center
for Space Celebration</ORGANIZATION> '89 festivities. ``I would rather see us
develop the technology to have planetary travel _ manned and
unmanned.''
   A separate celebration of the 20th anniversary of the <DATE>1969</DATE> moon
walk, meanwhile, included some bitterness.
   About 40 aging German rocket scientists who helped build
<LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s space program expressed disappointment that one of their
brethren was not present for a reunion of the 20th anniversary
celebration of Americans landing on the moon.
   <PERSON>Arthur Rudolph</PERSON>, project manager for the <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> 5 rocket at the
<ORGANIZATION>Marshall Space Flight Center</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Huntsville</LOCATION>, remained in voluntary
exile in his native <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION>, under threat of prosecution for
alleged Nazi war crimes if he returned to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>.
   ``It's a shame for the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> to send out a man who did so
much for the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>,'' said scientist <PERSON>Konrad Dannenberg</PERSON>.
``Everyone here should be ashamed this thing happened.''
   Rudolph, now 84, retired in <DATE>January 1970</DATE> after helping send two
spaceships to the moon and moved to <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, where he lived
in relative obscurity for 14 years.
   His tranquil retirement ended when the <ORGANIZATION>Justice Department's
Office of Special Investigations</ORGANIZATION> raised allegations that during
World War II he was involved in the deaths of thousands of
concentration camp prisoners who were forced to work in a V-2 rocket
factory where he was technical director. Those allegations were
backed up by some survivors.
   Rudolph left the country and returned to <LOCATION>Hamburg</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION>,
where a two-year investigation found no offense against <PERSON>Rudolph</PERSON>. His
West German citizenship was returned.
   <PERSON>Shepard</PERSON>, one of 12 Americans to walk on the moon, disagreed with
Apollo 11 moonwalker <PERSON>Edwin</PERSON> ``Buzz'' <PERSON>Aldrin</PERSON>, who said during a trip
to <LOCATION>Huntsville</LOCATION> <DATE>Saturday</DATE> that <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> should pursue joint missions
with the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> and possibly <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>.
   ``I think our space technology level, in general, is ahead of the
Soviets,'' <PERSON>Shepard</PERSON> said.
   Shepard, now 65, rode a Huntsville-built Redstone rocket into
space on <DATE>May 5, 1961</DATE>, as the American space program rushed to catch
the Soviets, who had sent <PERSON>Yuri Gagarin</PERSON> into space on <DATE>April 12</DATE>.
   He returned to space in <DATE>February 1971</DATE> on Apollo 14 and became the
fifth man to walk on the moon _ a feat never matched by the <LOCATION>Soviet
Union</LOCATION>. Shepard is now is a commercial real estate developer in
<LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION>.
   Meanwhile, children who weren't alive when man first landed on
the moon got a chance to guide another ``spacecraft'' to a lunar
landing <DATE>Monday</DATE>.
   Fifteen students worked at the <ORGANIZATION>Challenger Center</ORGANIZATION>'s mock <ORGANIZATION>Mission
Control</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION>, while another group of children were ``flying''
in a simulator at a second <ORGANIZATION>Challenger Center</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Greenbelt</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Md</LOCATION>. They
were helped by flight controllers who were in <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Mission Control</ORGANIZATION>
during Apollo 11's historic landing.
   The youths talked through headsets and completed checklists
before giving the go-ahead for the mock landing.
   The centers, built as a memorial to the seven astronauts who died
in the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger, offer youngsters a
chance to learn by participating in simulated missions.

   Children who weren't alive when man first landed
on the moon got a chance to guide another ``spacecraft'' to a lunar
landing <DATE>Monday</DATE> at the <ORGANIZATION>Challenger Center</ORGANIZATION>'s mock <ORGANIZATION>Mission Control</ORGANIZATION>.
   Aided by nine flight controllers who were in <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Mission
Control</ORGANIZATION> during Apollo 11's historic <DATE>July 1969</DATE> landing, the youths
talked through headsets and completed checklists before giving the
go-ahead for the mock landing.
   While the 15 students worked in <ORGANIZATION>Mission Control</ORGANIZATION>, another group of
children were ``flying'' in a simulator at a second <ORGANIZATION>Challenger
Center</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Greenbelt</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Md</LOCATION>. Accompanying those children was former
astronaut <PERSON>Michael Collins</PERSON>, who circled the moon in Apollo 11's
command module while <PERSON>Neil Armstrong</PERSON> and <PERSON>Edwin</PERSON> ``Buzz'' <PERSON>Aldrin</PERSON> landed
in the lunar module.
   ``I learned what it really feels like, and what you have to do to
communicate with people up there. It's really kind of hard,'' said
<PERSON>Trina Jones</PERSON>, 11, who will attend <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Lanier Middle School</ORGANIZATION> this
<DATE>fall</DATE>.
   ``I was afraid I would mess up,'' she added.
   The simulation marked the first time that students from the two
<ORGANIZATION>Challenger Centers</ORGANIZATION> were able to communicate with each other. The
facility in <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION> was the first center, opening in <DATE>August 1988</DATE>.
   The centers, built as a memorial to the seven astronauts who died
in the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger, offer youngsters a
chance to learn by participating in simulated missions. The two
centers are the first of a planned network of simulators.
   For about 30 minutes, the students sat behind their control
consoles along with the veteran flight controllers. The mostly
fourth-, fifth- and sixth-graders also watched three television
monitors above, which showed their counterparts working at the other
center and television footage taken when the real lunar module
approached the moon.
   Shortly before the landing, <PERSON>Gene Kranz</PERSON>, chief flight controller
for the touchdown <DATE>two decades ago</DATE>, asked all the controllers if they
were ``go, no-go'' for a landing. They all gave their OK.
   Soon, a voice from <LOCATION>Greenbelt</LOCATION> repeated the words spoken 20 years
ago: ``<LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION>. Tranquillity base here. The <ORGANIZATION>Eagle</ORGANIZATION> has landed.''
   Several relatives of the Challenger astronauts attended the
event, including <PERSON>Jane Smith</PERSON>, widow of pilot <PERSON>Michael Smith</PERSON>; <PERSON>Lorna
Onizuka</PERSON>, widow of <PERSON>Ellison Onizuka</PERSON>; and <PERSON>Cheryl McNair</PERSON>, widow of <PERSON>Ron
McNair</PERSON>.
   <PERSON>Kranz</PERSON>, who is now director of mission operations at the <ORGANIZATION>National
Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Johnson Space Center</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION>, said such simulations are important to keep children
interested in science and space so they may be motivated to pursue
careers in those areas.
   ``It's an incredible opportunity to basically challenge their
curiosity. If their curiosity is up, we'll do OK,'' <PERSON>Kranz</PERSON> said.

Twenty years ago this week, the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>' Apollo 11 spacecraft landed the 
first humans on the surface of the moon, fulfilling a dream shared by poets and 
presidents. 
</P>
<P>
That accomplishment stands as one of the great feats of modern science and is 
one whose legacy continues to be felt today. 
</P>
<P>
"Other than the pyramids, I don't know what other accomplishment by man even 
compares with it," said <PERSON>Christopher Kraft</PERSON>, former director of Apollo mission 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
When Astronaut <PERSON>Neil Armstrong</PERSON> set foot on the moon on <DATE>July 20, 1969</DATE>, he did 
more than fulfill President <PERSON>John F. Kennedy</PERSON>'s bold promise of <DATE>1961</DATE> to land a 
man on the moon before the end of the decade. Coming at a time of political and 
social turmoil, the landing unified a nation and provided some much-needed 
heroes -- most notably the Apollo 11 crew, <ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Edwin E.</PERSON> (Buzz) <PERSON>Aldrin 
Jr.</PERSON> and <PERSON>Michael Collins</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
But there were others among Apollo's 200,000 scientists, engineers and 
technicians who were the unknown, unseen heroes. They fought the lesser-known 
but critical battles of technology at a time when computerization was in its 
infancy, and they won. If they had not, the mission might have ended in 
disaster or there might have been no Apollo at all. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Gerry Elverum</PERSON> was one of those people. 
</P>
<P>
In <DATE>1961</DATE>, <PERSON>Elverum</PERSON> was an engineer at <ORGANIZATION>TRW</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Inglewood</LOCATION> designing rocket engines 
that he hoped would someday be used in space. 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION> had already decided to use 
the Gargantuan Saturn 5 engines to launch Apollo vehicles out of the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s 
atmosphere, but bringing a manned craft down to the moon's surface would 
require the development of an additional engine capable of controlled descent. 
</P>
<P>
Elverum thought he had that engine. 
</P>
<P>
Because it would serve as both a brake and booster for the descent vehicle, 
<PERSON>Elverum</PERSON>'s design allowed the thrust and direction of the engine to be adjusted 
by the vehicle's occupants. Should the need to change landing locations arise 
midway through descent, the astronauts would be able to modify the speed and 
trajectory of the craft accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
Although not involved in the original bidding process for the descent engine, 
<PERSON>Elverum</PERSON> and a team from <ORGANIZATION>TRW</ORGANIZATION> approached <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> contractors with their plans. 
</P>
<P>
"We have an idea for how that engine ought to really be made, and we want to 
talk to you about it," <PERSON>Elverum</PERSON> told the contractors. 
</P>
<P>
The contractors listened and, based on engine designs <PERSON>Elverum</PERSON> had made for much 
smaller vehicles and positive test results achieved with their scaled-up 
versions, eventually awarded <ORGANIZATION>TRW</ORGANIZATION> the contract for the only engines that have 
ever landed men on the moon. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a very intense time period," recalled <PERSON>Elverum</PERSON>, now a senior 
propulsion engineer at <ORGANIZATION>TRW</ORGANIZATION>. "We were not a known name in propulsion at that 
time . . . but we submitted a proposal and, lo and behold, we won." 
</P>
<P>
On the day of the Apollo 11 landing, <PERSON>Elverum</PERSON> and his crew were stationed at a 
test facility in <LOCATION>Bethpage</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>, where they monitored a full-scale mock-up of 
the Apollo lander. Should anything go wrong with the engine during descent, 
they would be asked to give technical advice to the astronauts in space. 
</P>
<P>
"In other words, if they were pushing buttons and the engines didn't start, we 
could in real time look at all the stuff and say, 'Here, try this, try that,' " 
<PERSON>Elverum</PERSON> explained. 
</P>
<P>
The engines performed flawlessly, however, responding on cue, even when 
<ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION> was forced seconds before touchdown to take manual control of the 
descent to avoid landing in a boulder field. Toggling the engine's control 
switch, a feature which <PERSON>Elverum</PERSON> had included in the design, <ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION> landed 
the craft safely, away from the lunar boulders. As <ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION> would later 
comment on the landing, the engine performed without a hitch. 
</P>
<P>
In years to come, the engine would be used successfully for tasks it was never 
designed to perform, as witnessed in the aborted Apollo 13 moon mission in 
<DATE>1970</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
On that mission, an oxygen tank attached to the craft's service module exploded 
halfway to the moon, leaving the three astronauts drifting in space. Using the 
landing vehicle as a lifeboat, however, the astronauts were able to swing 
around the moon and direct the craft back to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, using <PERSON>Elverum</PERSON>'s engine as 
their only propulsion. 
</P>
<P>
"When it was called on, the engine worked. You feel good about that," <PERSON>Elverum</PERSON> 
said. "When life gets tough, you can always look back and say there was 
something that worked and we accomplished it." 
</P>
<P>
If not for the split-second decision of another relatively unknown Apollo 11 
player, however, <PERSON>Elverum</PERSON>'s engine might never have had the chance to perform so 
perfectly in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
Before beginning its final descent to the moon's surface, the Apollo 11 lander, 
called <ORGANIZATION>Eagle</ORGANIZATION>, experienced a series of problems in its communication and 
navigational systems. 
</P>
<P>
After several hours in orbit around the moon while still attached to the Apollo 
command module and another period of orbit after separation, "everything looked 
fairly OK," said <PERSON>Steven Bales</PERSON>, who was the mission's 26-year-old guidance 
officer stationed back on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
As Eagle circled around from the dark side of the moon, preparing to begin the 
final descent process, "the communications were dropping in and out . . . and 
there were indications, ever so subtle, that possibly the down-range (landing) 
distance was a little off," <PERSON>Bales</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
Ground control crews considered the problems manageable, however, and the 
lander was given permission to begin its descent. But within moments, <PERSON>Bales</PERSON> 
noticed that <ORGANIZATION>Eagle</ORGANIZATION>'s navigational computer was registering a descent rate of 
about 20 feet per second slower than the module was actually traveling. 
</P>
<P>
Had the discrepancy grown to 35 feet per second, it would have disrupted 
navigation to the point where the descent would have to be aborted altogether, 
<PERSON>Bales</PERSON> said. But because it remained constant, he was able to give the go-ahead 
for the process to continue. 
</P>
<P>
But no sooner did that crisis pass than a systems alarm in <LOCATION>Eagle</LOCATION> began to 
sound, indicating more trouble with the vehicle's computer. The alarm, known as 
a "12 02" warning, showed that because of an informational overload, the 
computer was not completing some necessary calculations. 
</P>
<P>
"Here we are in the middle of the descent, we had just had a navigational 
concern and . . . we hear this program alarm. It was really a shock," <PERSON>Bales</PERSON> 
said. 
</P>
<P>
By chance, a similar problem had arisen in a simulation of the landing a few 
weeks earlier, and it had been determined that if the alarms came infrequently 
enough, the landing would not necessarily have to be aborted. The definition of 
infrequent, however, was left to the flight controller's discretion and a 
go/no-go decision based on the alarms would essentially be a judgment call. 
</P>
<P>
"So in a period of about 20 seconds I made up my mind that it was OK to 
continue," <PERSON>Bales</PERSON> explained. 
</P>
<P>
Although six more computer alarms cropped up over the next several minutes, 
<PERSON>Bales</PERSON> stuck by his decision, and after about 15 minutes, he and others back on 
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> heard the static-tinged voice of <ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION> announce: "<LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION>, 
<ORGANIZATION>Tranquility Base</ORGANIZATION> here. The <ORGANIZATION>Eagle</ORGANIZATION> has landed." 
</P>
<P>
With the thousands of workers involved in the lunar program, it is not 
surprising that the majority have gone unrecognized. Aldrin himself, though 
known by millions of Americans as <ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION>'s only companion in the <LOCATION>Eagle</LOCATION> 
lander, is destined to be remembered as the second man to set foot on the moon. 
People "want to say that (I) feel bad because he went out first, but I think 
it's small people who say that," <PERSON>Aldrin</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
However, he is also the person who called out altitude and directional readings 
for <ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION> when problems in the <ORGANIZATION>Eagle</ORGANIZATION>'s navigational computer forced a 
manual landing. Without that information, such a descent would probably have 
been impossible and could have ended in tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
Although after touchdown <PERSON>Aldrin</PERSON> followed <ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION> out onto the surface of the 
moon by less than 20 minutes, it is <ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION>'s name, not <PERSON>Aldrin</PERSON>'s, which comes 
to mind when recalling the historic landing and subsequent moon walk. 
</P>
<P>
In the years after <DATE>Apollo 11</DATE>, <PERSON>Aldrin</PERSON> has acknowledged that he developed a 
substance abuse problem in coping with the impact of the moon landing on his 
life and underwent psychiatric treatment for depression related to it. Now 
recovered, <PERSON>Aldrin</PERSON> said he holds no bitterness about his involvement in the moon 
program or about the lesser position he held on that mission. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now I'm very satisfied with my ability to project my talents to be very 
useful in the space program," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But like many involved in the Apollo program, Aldrin questions whether future 
space accomplishments can match Apollo's intensity and excitement. 
</P>
<P>
"Project Apollo was the single most audacious endeavor in human history," he 
wrote several years after the landing. "When future generations remember 
Apollo, just as we now recall the voyages of <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> . . . they will remember 
(that) in <DATE>July, 1969</DATE>, people like themselves first set foot on the moon."

<HEAD>Magazine Says Soviets Should Have Broadcast US Moon Landing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A leading Soviet space writer said in an article
published <DATE>Monday</DATE> the <ORGANIZATION>Kremlin</ORGANIZATION> made a mistake by not broadcasting live
television coverage when the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Apollo 11 mission landed on the
moon <DATE>July 21, 1969</DATE>.
   ``Late on the <TIME>night</TIME> of <DATE>July 21, 1969</DATE>, on central television, if
my memory doesn't trick me, they broadcast the program, `Pages of a
Musical Spectacle,''' <PERSON>Yaroslav Golovanov</PERSON> wrote in this week's
edition of the magazine <ORGANIZATION>Ogonyok</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``At that same moment, all of mankind was holding its breath for
the first landing of man on the moon.''
   Soviet television carried extensive coverage of the linkup of the
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Apollo and Soviet Soyuz capsules in <DATE>1975</DATE>, but largely ignored
the American program to land on the moon.
   By doing so, <PERSON>Golovanov</PERSON> wrote, ``we showed a lack of respect for
the astronauts, for that country ... and for ourselves. Our people
know about the Apollo program by hearsay, and are always amazed when
they hear that 12 men have landed on the moon.''
   ``It is never too late to correct a mistake. Today, 20 years
after the first steps on the moon, I want to recount the history of
Apollo 11 and its crew,'' <PERSON>Golovanov</PERSON> wrote in the first of a series
of articles to appear in <LOCATION>Ogonyok</LOCATION>. The magazine has been in the
forefront of glasnost, President <PERSON>Mikhail S. Gorbachev</PERSON>'s program of
greater openness.
   The article, illustrated with black-and-white photographs, gave
the biographies of the three crew members _ <PERSON>Neil Armstrong</PERSON>, <PERSON>Edwin</PERSON>
``Buzz'' <PERSON>Aldrin</PERSON> and <PERSON>Michael Collins</PERSON> _ and described the flight of
the ``Eagle'' lunar landing module.
   The most dangerous moment of the flight, <PERSON>Golovanov</PERSON> wrote, came
when <ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION> took manual control of the module for the final
descent.
   With tens of millions of television viewers around the world
watching a live broadcast, <PERSON>Golovanov</PERSON> wrote, <ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION> set the craft
down safely and ``man had landed on the moon. A bold and ancient
dream had come true.''
   Ogonyok did not indicate the scope of the articles to follow.

<HEAD>Astronaut John W. Young Disappointed With Space Program Progress</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former chief <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> astronaut says he is
disappointed in the progress of the nation's space program, blaming
the emphasis on the shuttle for a slowdown in space development and
exploration.
   The reusable orbiters on which <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> staked its future in the
early <DATE>1970s</DATE> have never been the workhorses their supporters
promised, says <PERSON>John W. Young</PERSON>.
   ``I think we were being unrealistic about what our capabilities
and limitations were in the old days,'' said <PERSON>Young</PERSON>, who flew on the
first manned Gemini mission in <DATE>1965</DATE>. ``It (the shuttle) just has to
have too much hands-on work done with it to make it do all the
things we wanted it to do.''
   Young, now a safety and engineering trouble-shooter for the
<ORGANIZATION>Johnson Space Center</ORGANIZATION>'s director, orbited the moon and explored its
surface during the Apollo era. He later commanded the first and
ninth shuttle flights.
   ``It is almost 20 years since we landed people on the moon,''
<PERSON>Young</PERSON> said. ``And if you had asked me after the moon landing what
we'd be doing in 20 years, I'd have said we'd have a base on the
moon in 20 years.''
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> sold the shuttle to <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> as a quickly refurbishable,
inexpensive-to-operate spacewagon.
   ``I never believed it could be that way,'' <PERSON>Young</PERSON> said. ``I
wasn't involved in selling it, but I was involved in the technical
details of helping design and build it, and it was too
complicated.''
   Young said the shuttle is capable of fulfilling its creators'
expectations, but tight budgets hurt it when <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> could not afford
to stockpile spare parts for quick repairs.
   Quick shuttle turnarounds and reflights and routine <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>
landings never panned out, nor is the shuttle an inexpensive way to
fly, he added. And the assumption that it pays to salvage and reuse
each <MONEY>$15 million</MONEY> solid fuel rocket booster casings may be wrong,
<PERSON>Young</PERSON> said.
   Delays in flights also affect <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s supply of flight-ready
astronauts. Fourteen astronauts who flew before the shuttle
Challenger exploded decided not to wait for flights to resume. The
space center has 93 astronauts left and is accepting applications
through <DATE>July 1</DATE> for a <DATE>1990</DATE> astronaut class.
   ``I expect there's a lot of astronauts leaving because they see
the line at the end of the tunnel _ the line they've got to stand
in to get a flight is so long.''

President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>, marking the 20th anniversary of man's first lunar landing, 
proposed today that the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> establish a base on the moon in the 21st 
Century to be followed by a manned mission to Mars. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Bush</PERSON> offered no price tag for the costly program he promised would lead "back 
to the moon, back to the future, and this time back to stay." 
</P>
<P>
"Then a journey into tomorrow," he said. "A journey to another planet, a manned 
mission to Mars." The distance between Mars and <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> varies from 48.7 million 
miles and 248 million miles. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Bush</PERSON> offered few details beyond his broad goals, and said he was leaving it to 
Vice President <PERSON>Dan Quayle</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>National Space Council</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> to come up with 
"realistic timetables." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Deadline for <ORGANIZATION>Mars Trip 
</P>
<P>
Adm. Richard Truly</ORGANIZATION>, administrator of <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>, said the President has asked that 
the lunar station be established in the <DATE>first decade of the next century</DATE>. He 
said no deadline has been set for the Mars mission. 
</P>
<P>
In a ceremony from the steps of the <ORGANIZATION>National Air and Space Museum</ORGANIZATION>, the 
President reasserted the goal of establishing Space Station Freedom in the 
<DATE>1990s</DATE>, the necessary first step for the moon and Mars projects. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Bush</PERSON> was flanked on the outdoor museum stage by <PERSON>Neil Armstrong</PERSON> and <PERSON>Buzz Aldrin</PERSON>, 
the two men who planted their footsteps on the moon on <DATE>July 20, 1969</DATE>, and 
<PERSON>Michael Collins</PERSON>, the third member of the Apollo 11 crew. 
</P>
<P>
"<LOCATION>America</LOCATION> should never stop seeking distant frontiers," <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> said. "We dream of 
distant shores we've not yet seen. . . . A dream to be realized by future 
generations must begin with this generation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have rested on our Apollo laurels long enough. It's time to get moving 
again," <PERSON>Collins</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Bush</PERSON> drew Democratic support for his vision, but the decision to provide no 
budget or deadline prompted criticism. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'One Small Step' 
</P>
<P>
Rep. <PERSON>Dennis E. Eckart</PERSON> (D-Ohio) said <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> was "calling for one great leap for 
mankind" but not even providing the money for "one small step," using a 
take-off of <ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION>'s first words from the lunar surface. 
</P>
<P>
"The party of <PERSON>John Kennedy</PERSON> and <PERSON>Lyndon Johnson</PERSON> applauds the decision of 
President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> to recommit <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> to space exploration," said Rep. <PERSON>Richard A. 
Gephardt</PERSON> (D-Mo.), the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> majority leader. 
</P>
<P>
"But the real test of presidential leadership is not whether he can marshal the 
words but the resources to restore <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s preeminence in space," <PERSON>Gephardt</PERSON> 
said. "In sum, <PERSON>Mr. President</PERSON>, there's no such thing as a free launch." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Gephardt</PERSON> said that under Democratic presidents of the '60s, the <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> budget 
approached <PERCENT>4%</PERCENT> of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> budget. Republican Presidents of the '80s have 
proposed less than <PERCENT>1%</PERCENT>, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
<MONEY>$30-Billion</MONEY> <ORGANIZATION>Start-Up Cost 
</P>
<P>
Truly</ORGANIZATION>, in a press briefing at the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION>, noted that <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> is already 
balking at the start-up costs for the <MONEY>$30-billion</MONEY> space station. The station is 
the essential for the moon project and the trip to Mars. 
</P>
<P>
"It is an irony that at the time we find this sort of leadership and vision for 
<LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s future, that at the same time, this very day up on the Hill, we are 
in fact fighting very hard for the very life of Space Station Freedom and other 
things in the civil space program," he said.

Twenty years. A blink of time in the universe but a fourth of a lifetime for 
most mortals. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Buzz Aldrin</PERSON>, 59, sits at a desk in his <LOCATION>Laguna Beach</LOCATION> home, windows opening on a 
stunning view of the <LOCATION>Emerald Bay</LOCATION> coast of the <LOCATION>Pacific Ocean</LOCATION>. To his right, a 
wall of pictures and artwork document his career as an <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> officer and 
astronaut. 
</P>
<P>
"<DATE>July 16</DATE> will be the 20th anniversary of the Apollo 11 launch," <PERSON>Aldrin</PERSON> said. 
"I'll be there, at the <LOCATION>Cape</LOCATION>, at the exact time of liftoff, to mark that 
anniversary." 
</P>
<P>
Four days later, <PERSON>Aldrin</PERSON> will be in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>. In the company of <PERSON>Neil Armstrong</PERSON> 
and <PERSON>Michael Collins</PERSON>, <PERSON>Aldrin</PERSON> will stand with President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION>Smithsonian</ORGANIZATION> 
Institution. Along with the rest of the world, they will recall the great 
adventure: the day <ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION> became the first man to step on the moon, and 
<PERSON>Aldrin</PERSON>, 18 minutes later, the second, while <PERSON>Collins</PERSON> soared in lunar orbit above 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty years after the moonwalk, <PERSON>Aldrin</PERSON> is clear-eyed, robust, physically fit. 
But he is clearly an angry man -- an explorer who is enraged at his country for 
failing to advance beyond the moon. Indeed, he is angry that the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> 
seems to have abandoned the moon itself. 
</P>
<P>
"<LOCATION>America</LOCATION> won the first moon race," <PERSON>Aldrin</PERSON> wrote in his new book, "Men from 
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>." "But it is possible we will become a second-rate space power in the 
next century." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, <PERSON>Aldrin</PERSON> repeatedly hit on the theme of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s squandering of 
the potential of the moon. It can serve as the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> launching pad to Mars, he 
said. The moon can provide "an ample supply of the isotope helium-3" to fuel 
nuclear fusion reactors that "would be almost completely devoid of 
radioactivity," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The moon, <PERSON>Aldrin</PERSON> said, could also be used to collect solar energy and beam it 
earthward -- a cheap, renewable source of power. 
</P>
<P>
Aldrin's blue eyes flash. He jabs a finger at the interviewer. 
</P>
<P>
"We went six years without even flying one American into orbit, while the 
Soviets continued to perfect Soyuz I, II, III, IV, V, <LOCATION>VI</LOCATION>, VII and then (the 
space station) Mir," <PERSON>Aldrin</PERSON> said. "And we still haven't put an operating 
location in space." 
</P>
<P>
There is already a great, logical place for the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> to build a 
permanent, human-staffed space station, he said. "It's called the moon." 
</P>
<P>
America needs a thriving, active base on the moon, he said. "Initially, we need 
to build up, to set out, the facilities that then can serve man (on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>) with 
lunar resources," <PERSON>Aldrin</PERSON> said. "We need information from telescopes to be 
placed on the far side of the moon. We need transmission bases and manned 
scientific investigations just like when they put people in <LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION>. We 
don't just put machines in <LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION> to send back lots of information. We put 
people down there." 
</P>
<P>
When <ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Collins</PERSON> and <PERSON>Aldrin</PERSON> blasted off from <LOCATION>Cape Kennedy</LOCATION> (now <LOCATION>Cape 
Canaveral</LOCATION>) in <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Aldrin</PERSON> was generally described as the threesome's most 
accomplished scientist. An intense, driven man, he speaks tersely, using few 
adjectives. When he stepped onto the moon's surface 20 years ago, however, he 
was moved to say: "Beautiful! beautiful! Magnificent desolation." Later, <PERSON>Aldrin</PERSON> 
unfurled an American flag, planted the staff into the tough lunar surface and 
then gave the Stars and Stripes a snappy West Point salute. An estimated 500 
million people around the world watched television coverage of the historic 
moment. 
</P>
<P>
In his book, <PERSON>Aldrin</PERSON> said his most nervous moments came during the flag 
ceremony. "I suddenly felt stage fright," he wrote. "Since childhood, I'd been 
fascinated by explorers planting flags on strange shores. Now I was about to do 
the same thing, but on the most exotic shore mankind had ever reached." 
</P>
<P>
Before stepping onto the lunar surface, <PERSON>Aldrin</PERSON> performed a private religious 
ceremony inside the module. Using a small Communion kit given him by his 
Presbyterian pastor, <PERSON>Aldrin</PERSON> conducted a remembrance of <ORGANIZATION>Christ</ORGANIZATION>'s <DATE>Last Supper</DATE>. "I 
gave thanks," <PERSON>Aldrin</PERSON> wrote in his book. 
</P>
<P>
Life has brought hard landings for the former astronaut since his historic 
moonwalk. Aldrin, who bought a condominium and moved to <LOCATION>Orange County</LOCATION> about 5 
1/2 years ago, had divorced twice before he met and married <PERSON>Lois Driggs Aldrin</PERSON> 
and moved to her <LOCATION>Emerald Bay</LOCATION> home. He has battled depression and overcome an 
addiction to alcohol. Aldrin has also encountered career frustration. Instead 
of another space job after Apollo 11, <PERSON>Aldrin</PERSON> was assigned to command the test 
flight school at <ORGANIZATION>Edwards Air Force Base</ORGANIZATION>, north of <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"I went back to the <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> and tried to find a home there," <PERSON>Aldrin</PERSON> said. "It 
was a challenging assignment, but inappropriate really for me to command a test 
pilot school. I'd never had any formal training in test piloting. Also, I'd 
been away from the military 11 years -- 3 1/2 years while getting my doctor's 
degree at <ORGANIZATION>MIT</ORGANIZATION> (<ORGANIZATION>Massachusetts Institute of Technology</ORGANIZATION>) and 7 1/2 years at <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> 
(<ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION>). A much better assignment would 
have been at the <ORGANIZATION>Air Force Academy</ORGANIZATION>, as commandant of cadets. But they (in the 
<ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION>) had other ideas in mind." 
</P>
<P>
Aldrin was born in <LOCATION>Montclair</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>, and christened <PERSON>Edwin E. Aldrin Jr</PERSON>. He 
legally changed his name to Buzz, his lifelong nickname, about 10 years ago. 
The nickname was his older sister's fuzzy way of calling him "baby brother." 
</P>
<P>
He graduated in <DATE>1951</DATE> from the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Military Academy at <LOCATION>West Point</LOCATION>, third in his 
class. Aldrin was a fighter pilot during the Korean War and credited with 
shooting down two MIG-15 jets. After earning his doctorate from <ORGANIZATION>MIT</ORGANIZATION>, for which 
he wrote on orbital rendezvous techniques in space, he was tapped for the 
astronaut program in <DATE>1963</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his long years in the military, <PERSON>Aldrin</PERSON> now speaks acidly of the <ORGANIZATION>Air 
Force</ORGANIZATION>. "I've seen that the <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> really doesn't know how to treat space 
people," he said. "They don't look after their promotions, their livelihood, 
anywhere near the way the <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> does." 
</P>
<P>
He retired with the rank of colonel in <DATE>March, 1972</DATE>. By then, <PERSON>Aldrin</PERSON> was 
experiencing periods of depression, which he candidly discussed in his first 
book, "Return to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>." 
</P>
<P>
Now, years later, as he sits at his home in <LOCATION>Laguna Beach</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Aldrin</PERSON> says 
alcoholism was at the root of the depression. 
</P>
<P>
"The last person to be aware of the seriousness and progression of the disease 
of alcoholism is the person who's got it," <PERSON>Aldrin</PERSON> said. "So I was unable to 
really come to grips (with) what was troubling me at the time. And it was not 
depression or anxiety or nervousness. It was inherited, genetic traits (toward 
alcoholism) that I just fostered and encouraged, and thank God, the trauma of 
being put on a pedestal, and trying to live up to that, accelerated the 
progression (of the disease) so that I had a chance, before I was too old, to 
go through a recovery process. So all of that brought about this kind of 
turnaround and forced me to make that kind of recovery in '75 and <DATE>'76</DATE>. I had 
three years of stumbling around, but now it's 10 1/2 years" of continuous 
sobriety. 
</P>
<P>
"Let me tell it more simply," his wife, <PERSON>Lois</PERSON>, said. "What would you do at the 
age of 40, if you'd worked for this fantastic career where you reached the top? 
You'd want to go on! But what if you found suddenly that you couldn't go on in 
that career -- that your progress and your ideas in life were stopped? So who 
wouldn't get depressed?" 
</P>
<P>
America has made poor use of its former astronauts, <PERSON>Aldrin</PERSON> said. "I don't think 
we've done very well as far as establishing a rapport between all former 
astronauts on an annual basis," he said. "We haven't got a unity. We're taken 
advantage of because of that. We've played one against the other. We don't get 
the privileges that I think our status deserves, and it's because we're not 
unified. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, I really know an awful lot about what we ought to do in the future 
in space," he said. "But I'm not consulted when decisions are made. I think I 
should be." 
</P>
<P>
Aldrin's permanent status as the second man to walk on the moon has led to 
endless interview questions and a suggestion in his book that he was 
dissatisfied with the decision. But <PERSON>Aldrin</PERSON> pointed out in the interview that 
<ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION> was both commander of the lunar expedition and had seniority because 
he was picked earlier for training as an astronaut. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd have a hard time explaining why the junior member of the third group (of 
astronauts), the co-pilot, was given the privilege of saying the historic words 
of first putting his foot on the moon and then looking back and seeing my 
commander in the lunar module waiting his turn to come down to the surface," 
<PERSON>Aldrin</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
He said he is not bitter. "Why should I be? But how do I deny being bitter 
about it? How the hell can you answer that one except by saying, 'Listen, 
honestly, I'm a military man, I understand seniority.' " 
</P>
<P>
Aldrin, an international space consultant and lecturer since his military 
retirement, is now finding life good. He likes living in <LOCATION>Orange County</LOCATION> because 
"it's got growth and tremendous opportunity." He also enjoys being near the 
tranquility of the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
His three grown children -- a daughter and two sons -- visit frequently.

<HEAD>Bush Says U.S. Must Go Back to Moon, on to Mars</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HOWARD BENEDICT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Aerospace Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Twenty years after man's first step on the
moon, President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> said <DATE>Thursday</DATE> Americans must commit to the
permanent settlement of space, first returning to the moon and then
embarking on a ``journey into tomorrow,'' a manned mission to
distant Mars.
   The president offered no firm timetable or pricetag for a program
that could cost <MONEY>hundreds of billions of dollars</MONEY> but said it would be
worth the cost ``because it is humanity's destiny to strive, to
seek, to find. And because it is <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s destiny to lead.''
   His proposal was made in a ceremony, on the steps of the <ORGANIZATION>National
Air and Space Museum</ORGANIZATION>, marking the historic moment <DATE>July 20, 1969</DATE>,
when American astronauts <PERSON>Neil Armstrong</PERSON> and <PERSON>Buzz Aldrin</PERSON> stepped on
the moon's <ORGANIZATION>Sea of Tranquility</ORGANIZATION> to fulfill a pledge made eight years
earlier by President <PERSON>Kennedy</PERSON>.
   The two moonwalkers stood with <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> <DATE>Friday</DATE>, along with <PERSON>Mike
Collins</PERSON>, the third Apollo 11 crewman who said, ``We have rested on
our Apollo laurels long enough; it's time to get moving again.''
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s proposal _ to establish a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> moon base early in the next
century and then mount a manned Mars mission _ likely will ignite a
long national debate both in a budget-minded <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> and among
those who believe federal dollars should not be spent on costly
space endeavors but on solving more earthly problems.
   At a time of huge budget deficits, <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> already is balking at
the start-up costs for <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s <MONEY>$30 billion</MONEY> space station, which <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>
said was ``a first and necessary step for sustained manned
exploration.''
   <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>, he said, is ``where the future of the space station _
and our future as a space-faring nation _ will be decided.''
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> offered few details beyond his broad goals and said he was
leaving it to Vice President <PERSON>Dan Quayle</PERSON>, as head of the <ORGANIZATION>National
Space Council</ORGANIZATION>, and to <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> to come up with ``realistic timetables.''
Putting the space station in orbit has been scheduled for after <DATE>1995</DATE>.
   The president chose to look beyond the budget debate over the
space station budget.
   ``We must commit ourselves anew to ... the permanent settlement
of space,'' he said. ``We must commit ourselves to a future where
Americans and citizens of all nations will live and work in space.''
   Richard Truly, the <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> administrator hailed <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s initiative as
``dynamite'' and said that if the program is approved, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> will be
ready to establish a moon base ``in the dawn of the new century.''
   Truly said cuts in the <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> budget in recent years have weakened
the agency so that in its present structure it could not carry out
such visionary plans.
   Truly said he had no estimate on how much <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s program would
cost. But he noted that during the heyday of the Apollo program
<ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s funding represented more than <PERCENT>4 percent</PERCENT> of the national
budget compared with about <PERCENT>1 percent</PERCENT> now.
   He said the job could be done with less than <PERCENT>4 percent</PERCENT>.
   Other observers have estimated that if <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s proposal were
adopted, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s present budget request of <MONEY>$13.3 billion</MONEY> would have
to more than double within a few years and that the whole package
eventually could cost as much as <MONEY>$800 billion</MONEY> to <MONEY>$900 billion</MONEY>.
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> will need to forge an alliance with Democratic leaders to
win the funding for serious space exploration, and initial skeptical
reaction came from Rep. <PERSON>Richard Gephardt</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-Mo.</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> majority
leader.
   ``The real test of presidential leadership is not whether he can
marshal the words but the resources to restore <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s preeminence
in space,'' <PERSON>Gephardt</PERSON> said. ``In sum, <PERSON>Mr. President</PERSON>, there's no such
thing as a free launch.''
   The proposal also drew opposition from a key member of the house
committee that oversees <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> appropriations.
   ``Given the federal budget deficit and earthly demands, I don't
see how we can afford expensive manned programs in space in the near
future,'' said Rep. Bill Green of <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>.
   Rep. <PERSON>Dennis Eckart</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-Ohio</LOCATION>, said <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> was ``calling for one great
leap for mankind'' but not even providing the money for ``one small
step,'' using a take-off of <ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION>'s first words from the lunar
surface.
   <PERSON>Sen. Albert Gore</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-Tenn.</LOCATION>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> committee
charged with the space agency budget, said: ``By proposing a return
to the moon and a manned base on Mars, with no money, no timetable
and no plan, <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> offers the country not a challenge to inspire us,
but a daydream to briefly entertain us.''
   Meanwhile, the full <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> handily defeated an attempt by Rep.
<PERSON>Charles Schumer</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-N.Y.</LOCATION>, to transfer <MONEY>$714 million</MONEY> from the proposed
fiscal <DATE>1990</DATE> budget for the space station to programs for veterans'
medical care, pollution control and low-income and elderly housing.
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s ceremony with the astronauts blended his glimpse into the
future with reminiscences of the Apollo program.
   He unveiled a new postage stamp commemorating the first moon
landing, then signed a proclamation marking Space Exploration Day.
He invited the astronauts and their families back to the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION>
for a picnic lunch.
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> recalled the first moon landing <DATE>two decades ago</DATE>, saying,
``Some called it quixotic, impossible ... but <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> did it.'' Now,
he said, it is time for the nation to head ``back to the moon, back
to the future, and this time back to stay.''
   Under <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> scenarios outlined last year, a permanently manned
base on the front side of the moon would require astronaut crews to
construct an Antarctic-type facility, mixing mineral-rich lunar soil
with water to form a kind of cement.
   Oxygen extracted from moon rocks could be mixed with hydrogen
brought from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> to fuel expeditions to Mars and elsewhere.
   To explore Mars, one <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> option would use humans, the other a
robot to move around the surface. A third would place men on the
Mars moon Phobos to guide the rover on Mars.

   While <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> marks the 20th
anniversary of man's landing on the moon, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> has on its wish list
a permanent scientific lunar outpost early next century.
   When astronauts <PERSON>Neil Armstrong</PERSON> and <PERSON>Buzz Aldrin</PERSON> set foot in the
lunar dust <DATE>July 20, 1969</DATE>, some scientists saw it as a logical step
toward building a research base there.
   But no overwhelming public or political support developed for
such an expensive undertaking, and blueprints were shelved.
   Some scientists continued through the years to yearn for a moon
base. Mineral-rich lunar soil could support crops grown under
pressurized domes, researchers say, and a commercially valuable gas,
prevalent on the moon, could be returned to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> where it is rare.
   The scientists have a glimmer of hope in a document released last
<DATE>December</DATE> by <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Office of Exploration</ORGANIZATION>, ``Beyond Earth's Horizons
_ Human Exploration of the Solar System in the 21st Century.'' It
outlined possibilities for two moon bases among four potential
manned expeditions. The other two involve flights to the Martian
moon Phobos and to Mars itself.
   One of the moon bases envisioned would not be permanently
staffed. It would serve chiefly as an astronomy laboratory where
telescopes, free of the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s obscuring atmosphere and interfering
electronic transmissions, could study the most distant radioemitting
galaxies and search for extraterrestrial life.
   The exploration office plan puts this unmanned base on the moon's
far side, which is permanently hidden from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. Each of four
successive four-person crews would work through a 14-day lunar day,
setting up equipment delivered by unmanned cargo vehicles, before
returning to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> or an orbiting space station as a 14-day night
begins. Staying through a frigid lunar night would require
considerable extra support equipment.
   Once the observatory is built the telescopes would operate
automatically, sending images and data to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> through a satellite
orbiting the moon, or the ground could direct them to look at
certain celestial objects.
   Astronauts would return to the base every three years to service
the equipment and to collect and replace telescope film.
   The second base, on the front side of the moon, would be
permanently manned.
   Many astronaut crews over several years would be required to
construct an Antarctic-type facility, using raw building materials
already there. The Apollo missions disclosed that every shovelful of
lunar soil is rich in metals and silicon and that this soil can be
mixed with water to form a type of cement.
   Oxygen is the most abundant element on the moon, and this can be
combined with hydrogen to make water. Because oxygen is five-sixths
of what rocket engines burn, the base could also serve as a tank
farm for spacecraft flying between <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and the moon or embarking
for Mars or elsewhere in the solar system.
   A lunar resource of potentially great commercial value is
helium-3, an isotope of helium with one neutron and two protons,
instead of the two neutrons and two protons in ordinary helium.
Physicists see it as a cleaner, more efficient alternative to the
fuels foreseen for conventional fusion reactors to generate
electrical power.
   On Earth, helium-3 exists only in very small quantities as a
by-product of nuclear weapons production. But on the moon it is
abundant, deposited by the sun's charged particles.
   Studies done by the <ORGANIZATION>Fusion Technology Institute</ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION>University
of Wisconsin</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> indicate that as little as 40,000 pounds of
helium-3 could be transported to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> on just two lunar return
trips. Used in a national array of fusion reactors, this amount
could supply the energy needs of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> for a year.
   The exploration office study says either or both moon bases could
be started early in the next century. The report did not include
expedition costs, but <PERSON>Frank Martin</PERSON>, chief of the office, said,
``It's clear that in order to do these things you are going to have
to spend more money, a larger percentage of the federal budget.''

<TEXT>
   For the second time in the brief
history of manned space flight, the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> is poised to
rebound from tragedy.
   The explosion of the shuttle Challenger on <DATE>Jan. 28, 1986</DATE>, bore
some striking similarities to another disaster almost exactly 19
years earlier _ the Apollo 1 fire of <DATE>Jan. 27, 1967</DATE>.
   In both cases, poor design, inadequate management, safety lapses
and communications breakdowns were at fault. Recovery required
months of remorse, realignment and repair.
   Failure to recover from Apollo 1 would have derailed <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s
goal of a manned lunar landing before the <DATE>end of the decade</DATE>.
Another Challenger-type accident could deal a death blow to the
nation's space program.
   But the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION> bounced
back brilliantly from the <DATE>1967</DATE> fire and sent astronauts to the
moon. And now the agency says it has done everything it can to make
the shuttle a safe ship, and the first flight since Challenger is
set for liftoff <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> is counting on success to revive its fortunes and provide a
springboard to a future that will include a permanent manned space
station and eventually flights to Mars and other parts of the solar
system.
   There is also the matter of national pride. Before Challenger,
the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> held undisputed world leadership in space
exploration. But since the accident, the Soviets have overtaken the
Americans in many categories, including manned spaceflight
experience, and they have a stated goal to dispatch men to Mars
early in the <DATE>21st century</DATE>.
   In <DATE>1967</DATE>, the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> also had its eye on the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>.
America had been stung by early Russian space successes and the two
superpowers were in a race to see which could first land men on the
moon as a symbol of technological prowess.
   Against that backdrop, the three Apollo 1 astronauts, <PERSON>Gus
Grissom</PERSON>, <PERSON>Ed White</PERSON> and <PERSON>Roger Chaffee</PERSON>, entered their capsule atop a
<ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> 1B rocket on that day late in <DATE>January</DATE> for a launch pad
countdown test. They were scheduled for launch into <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> orbit in
<DATE>February</DATE> on the first flight test of the Apollo spacecraft that was
to transport astronauts to the moon.
   Five hours later all three were dead, killed by a fire that
swept through the spacecraft.
   An investigation board could not pinpoint definitely the cause
of the fire, but listed the most likely source as an electric arc
in defective wiring under <PERSON>Grissom</PERSON>'s seat.
   The report criticized <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>North American Aviation</ORGANIZATION>, the
capsule builder, for poor management, carelessness, negligence,
sloppy work and failure to adequately consider the safety of the
astronauts.
   Top management at both were overhauled, and a <MONEY>$75 million</MONEY>
program was launched to redesign the spacecraft.
   Twenty-one months after the accident, on <DATE>Oct. 11, 1968</DATE>, the
effort paid off when three astronauts rode a redesigned capsule
into orbit and thoroughly checked it out during an 11-day flight.
The mission was so successful that <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> scheduled the next flight
as an orbital trip around the moon on <ORGANIZATION>Christmas Eve</ORGANIZATION>.
   Two more preliminary flights followed, and on <DATE>July 20, 1969</DATE>,
astronauts <PERSON>Neil Armstrong</PERSON> and <PERSON>Buzz Aldrin</PERSON> set foot on the moon,
beating President <PERSON>John F. Kennedy</PERSON>'s end-of-the-decade deadline by
five months.
   Six more moon missions followed, but three others were canceled.
   The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> had won the race to the moon, leaving the
Soviets far behind. But ironically, with the end of this era came a
long, troubled period for <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>.
   The agency should not have been surprised. From a peak budget of
<MONEY>$6 billion</MONEY> in <DATE>1965</DATE>, at the height of Apollo development, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s
fortunes had been declining every year. Several next-generation
proposals had been rejected or scaled down.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> had counted on the tide of Apollo 11 enthusiasm to rescue
its bold plans for the future. But the agency misread the mood of a
nation torn by <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> and by racial unrest. Much of the press and
some politicians came to view the space effort as a symbol of
misplaced national priorities. With detente, the Soviet threat no
longer seemed so ominous.
   <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> and the <PERSON>Nixon</PERSON> administration told the agency to scrap
its plans for large space stations, a moon base and manned trips to
Mars. <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> budgets fell below <MONEY>$4 billion</MONEY>, its personnel from a peak
of 36,000 to 21,000.
   The only major project to survive was the reusable space
shuttle, but it was years away.
   In the interim, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> used leftover Apollo rockets and spacecraft
to build Skylab, a modest space station which in <DATE>1973</DATE> and <DATE>1974</DATE>
served as orbital home to three crews for periods up to 84 days.
Another leftover Apollo capsule carried three American astronauts
to a linkup with two Soviet cosmonauts in <DATE>1975</DATE>.
   Following that flight, the American manned space program entered
a dry spell of six years.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> had hoped to launch the first shuttle in <DATE>1978</DATE>, but there
were funding difficulties and serious design and development
problems.
   The shortage of money forced engineers to abandon plans for a
fully reusable shuttle employing only liquid fuel engines. Instead
they settled on two solid fuel rockets to assist the craft into
orbit _ a decision that would come back to haunt them the day
Challenger blew up.
   <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION>, the first shuttle, made it into orbit in <DATE>April 1981</DATE>,
starting a string of 24 successful flights. The program boasted
some remarkable achievements, from flying the first American women
and black astronauts, to deploying satellites, retrieving and
repairing others and conducting pioneering experiments in a cargo
bay unit known as Spacelab.
   Spaceflight seemingly had become routine and <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> became so
confident of its machine that it added congressmen, a Saudi prince
and non-astronaut researchers and scientists to the crews.
   A schoolteacher, <PERSON>Christa McAuliffe</PERSON>, was in the crew of seven
when the string ended with that awful explosion of Challenger 73
seconds after liftoff on a cold <DATE>January</DATE> day in <DATE>1986</DATE>.
   When the <ORGANIZATION>Rogers</ORGANIZATION> commission that investigated the accident
released its report, it sounded as though the space agency had
forgotten the lessons of Apollo 1.
   The report said the direct cause of the explosion was a leak at
a joint between two segments of one of Challenger's two solid fuel
booster rockets. Flames shot past two synthetic rubber O-rings and
ignited the external fuel tank.
   The commission said cold weather, 36 degrees at launch time,
contributed to the accident by robbing the rings of their
resiliency, preventing them from sealing the joint properly. Some
engineers had argued with lower-level managers against launching in
the cold, but their concerns never were communicated to those
making the launch decision.
   The report scored <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> for lapses in judgment, safety, design,
communications and management. There were wholesale shakeups of
management at the space agency and the booster rocket maker, <ORGANIZATION>Morton
Thiokol</ORGANIZATION>, and a <MONEY>$1.2 billion</MONEY> redesign program was undertaken.
   A total of 56 major and 400 lesser changes have been made to
Discovery. <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> says it now is ready to put them and its future to
the test.

<HEAD>NASA to Astronauts: Don't Risk Your Necks Until We Tell You To</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With no public announcement, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s director of
flight crew operations a year ago issued the first written order
prohibiting astronauts-in-training from taking part in ``risky
recreational activities.''
   ``High risk recreational activities are defined as those where
there exists exposure of major, or even fatal, injury,'' <PERSON>Donald R.
Puddy</PERSON> said in the order. ``Examples include, but are not limited to:
auto, boat, airplane or motorcycle racing; parachute jumping; and
snow skiing.''
   Astronauts, especially the early ones who had been fighter jocks,
often had boisterous habits that worried <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>, which wanted to keep
its highfliers safe until they could risk their necks officially.
   Last <DATE>weekend</DATE>, astronaut <PERSON>S. David Griggs</PERSON>, scheduled to be the
pilot on a shuttle mission in <DATE>November</DATE>, crashed and was killed in
<LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION> while practicing stunt flying for an air show. He was doing
``wing-over'' maneuvers in a vintage World War II single-engine
propeller plane.
   The investigation into the accident is not complete and <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> has
not determined whether <PERSON>Griggs</PERSON>' activities violated the rules, <PERSON>Puddy</PERSON>
said <DATE>Friday</DATE>. A replacement for <PERSON>Griggs</PERSON>, who was just beginning his
training for the flight, will be named next week.
   ``Essentially, the policy put in place in <DATE>June 1988</DATE> is generally
worded,'' said <PERSON>Jeff Carr</PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION>Johnson Space Center</ORGANIZATION>
in <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>. ``It doesn't say, `Thou shalt not do this and this'; it
doesn't mention anything as specific as aerobatic flying or stunt
flying. It says, `Hey, guys, use your head. Don't do something that
could expose you to injury or death.'''
   <PERSON>William Klassen</PERSON>, regional director of the <ORGANIZATION>National Transportation
Safety Board</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Kansas City</LOCATION>, said of the <PERSON>Griggs</PERSON> incident: ``We have
no evidence of engine problems or problems with the aircraft. He was
in the process of performing aerobatics and the aircraft was
observed flying over the runway at an altitude of 75 to 100 feet
above ground level.''
   <PERSON>Griggs</PERSON> was the latest in a long line of astronauts whose appetite
for life in the fast lane extended beyond their duty hours.
   <PERSON>Gordon Cooper</PERSON>, one of the Mercury Seven astronauts, had a
disconcerting fondness for racing fast cars and was about to make
his professional driving debut at the <ORGANIZATION>Daytona International Speedway</ORGANIZATION>
in <DATE>February 1969</DATE> when <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> ordered him to cancel.
   ``The people in flight crew operations felt it would be better if
<PERSON>Cooper</PERSON> didn't take any risk such as auto racing, especially since he
is part of the backup crew for the important Apollo 10 mission
scheduled to orbit the moon in <DATE>May</DATE>,'' the official announcement said.
   ``They waited until the last minute to shut me off and I don't
appreciate it,'' said <PERSON>Cooper</PERSON>. He never flew in space again.
   Astronauts often were in the news for their various sports
injuries. <PERSON>James Lovell</PERSON>, a four-time space flyer in the <LOCATION>Gemini</LOCATION> and
Apollo programs, fractured his arm and shoulder while skiing in
<LOCATION>Kitzbuehl</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Austria</LOCATION>; and <PERSON>Walter Cunningham</PERSON> of Apollo 7, suffered a
compression fracture of the vertebrae in his neck while using a
trampoline.
   The daredevil cavorting of the early astronauts was chronicled in
``The Right Stuff'' by <PERSON>Tom Wolfe</PERSON> in <DATE>1979</DATE>. But even the publicity
attending <PERSON>Wolfe</PERSON>'s account failed to shame or tame the astronaut
corps.
   ``I can remember discussions about what was restricted and what
wasn't, but I think all those things were unwritten rules,'' said
<PERSON>Alan Bean</PERSON>, who walked on the moon on Apollo 12, then spent 59 days
in <LOCATION>Skylab</LOCATION>. ``People were aware they should try to minimize risks.
Really, we got more people injured playing softball than anything
else.''
   In fact, <ORGANIZATION>Puddy</ORGANIZATION>'s order cautions against ``nominal risk
recreational activities ... where there exists exposure to injury.''
   Included: Organized competitive softball, basketball, volleyball,
or racquetball. Astronauts are prohibited from taking part in those
beginning eight months prior to launch.
   Puddy said he issued the order when he was new on the job so
there would be no ambiguity. To his knowledge, <PERSON>Puddy</PERSON> said, the
no-risk rules were never written before.
   <PERSON>Brian Duff</PERSON>, former head of <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s division of public affairs,
remembers accompanying <PERSON>Neil Armstrong</PERSON> on a publicity tour to <LOCATION>Latin
America</LOCATION>, long before <ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION> was picked to be the first man on the
moon.
   One morning, in <LOCATION>Peru</LOCATION>, he heard someone offer <ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION> a chance
to go soaring in the <LOCATION>Andes</LOCATION>. ``I had to sit down and ask myself,
`Should I let him do it?''' Duff recalls. ``I figured he would
probably do it anyway, so I deliberately made sure I wasn't around
when he was picked up.''
   Astronauts didn't need to go off the reservation to do dangerous
things. Preparing for the Apollo 11 moon flight, <ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION> was
rehearsing the descent to the moon when the simulator, known as
``The Flying Bedstead'' tipped over and crashed to the ground.
   The space fliers' fondness for living dangerously extended to
their children as well. Duff recalls that the children of <PERSON>Pete
Conrad</PERSON>, the commander of Apollo 12, used to ride their bicycles off
the roof of their house in <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> into the swimming pool below.
   <PERSON>Griggs</PERSON> was the 17th astronaut to die since the manned space
program began. Twelve died in the line of duty, one in an auto
accident, two in private aircraft crashes, one of cancer after
leaving the space program and one of a heart attack.
   The list includes the five <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> astronauts in the Challenger
explosion of <DATE>1986</DATE>, but not non-NASA payload specialists <PERSON>Gregory
Jarvis</PERSON> and <PERSON>Christa McAuliffe</PERSON>.
   Just eight days before the Apollo 14 moon flight in <DATE>1971</DATE>, backup
flight commander <PERSON>Eugene A. Cernan</PERSON> survived a fiery helicopter crash
in the <LOCATION>Indian River</LOCATION> south of <LOCATION>Cape Canaveral</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla.</LOCATION>, and had to swim
for his life. Reports circulated, but were never in the public
record, that he had been chasing a manatee, a large aquatic mammal,
and got too close to the water. An investigating board said <PERSON>Cernan</PERSON>
exercised ``misjudgment in estimating altitude.''
   <PERSON>Fred Haise</PERSON>, one of the astronauts on Apollo 13, which was
crippled by an explosion on the way to the moon in <DATE>1970</DATE>, crashed in
<DATE>1973</DATE> while trying to land a World War II training plane at
<LOCATION>Galveston</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>. He was critically burned.
   The BT13 airplane was owned by the <ORGANIZATION>Confederate Air Force</ORGANIZATION>, an
organization of airplane buffs, to which other astronauts _
including moonwalker <PERSON>Donald K. Slayton</PERSON> _ belonged.
   <PERSON>Slayton</PERSON>, who once headed the astronaut office, said he had to
warn <PERSON>Cooper</PERSON> and <PERSON>Charles Conrad</PERSON> about their auto racing activities.
``I called them and said, `You guys ought not to be doing that;
you've got too much at risk.''
   But <PERSON>Bill O'Donnell</PERSON>, a retired <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> public affairs officer, said
he recalled rumors at the time that the two astronauts continued
their racing _ under assumed names.

   The footprints left in the lunar dust
20 years ago by Apollo 11 astronauts <PERSON>Neil Armstrong</PERSON> and <PERSON>Buzz Aldrin</PERSON>
should be visible for half a million years because the moon has no
atmosphere to erode them, says a <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> chemist.
   But the absence of an atmosphere also leaves the moon unprotected
from meteorite and cosmic ray strikes, and these eventually will
erase the footprints, reports <PERSON>James R. Arnold</PERSON>.
   Arnold, who calls himself a cosmochemist, is director of the
<ORGANIZATION>California Space Institute</ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION>University of California</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>San
Diego</LOCATION>.
   ``The moon is a quiet place, lacking an atmosphere, and is
therefore free of wind and rain,'' he said.
   Arnold and his colleagues have developed techniques to measure
the rate of erosion and turnover of rocks and soil on the moon by
studying radioactive isotopes in samples brought back from six
Apollo lunar landing missions.

<HEAD>Former Chief Astronaut Disappointed With Space Program Progress</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former chief astronaut says the emphasis on the
space shuttle is to blame for a slowdown in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s space program.
   Astronaut <PERSON>John W. Young</PERSON>, who flew on the first manned Gemini
mission in <DATE>1965</DATE> and later walked on the moon, expressed
disappointment with the space program's progress in a recent
interview.
   ``It is almost 20 years since we landed people on the moon,''
said <PERSON>Young</PERSON>, 57. ``And if you had asked me after the moon landing
what we'd be doing in 20 years, I'd have said we'd have a base on
the moon in 20 years.''
   Young, now a safety and engineering trouble-shooter for <ORGANIZATION>Johnson
Space Center</ORGANIZATION>'s director, commanded the first and ninth shuttle
flights while serving as chief astronaut for the <ORGANIZATION>National
Aeronautics and Space Admininstration</ORGANIZATION>.
   He said the shuttles on which <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> staked its future in the
early <DATE>1970s</DATE> have never been the inexpensive, quickly refurbished
workhorses that their supporters promised.
   ``I never believed it could be that way,'' <PERSON>Young</PERSON> said. ``I
wasn't involved in selling it, but I was involved in the technical
details of helping design and build it, and it was too
complicated.''
   Young said the shuttle is capable of fulfilling its creators'
expectations, but tight budgets hurt it when <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> could not afford
to stockpile spare parts for quick repairs. And, he said, the
spacecraft's design can slow repairs because some areas are hard to
reach.
   He said that quick shuttle turnarounds and reflights and routine
<LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> landings never panned out, nor is the shuttle an
inexpensive way to fly.
   The basic assumption that it pays to salvage and reuse each <MONEY>$15
million</MONEY> solid-fuel rocket booster may be wrong, <PERSON>Young</PERSON> said.
   He also said the delays are affecting the supply of flight-ready
astronauts. Fourteen astronauts who flew before the <DATE>Jan. 28, 1986</DATE>,
Challenger explosion decided not to wait for flights to resume. The
space center has 93 astronauts and is accepting applications
through <DATE>July 1</DATE> for a <DATE>1990</DATE> astronaut class.
   ``I expect there's a lot of astronauts leaving because they see
the line at the end of the tunnel,'' <PERSON>Young</PERSON> said. ``The line they've
got to stand in to get a flight is so long.''

<HEAD>Neil Armstrong Took `Small Step' Himself</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For nearly 20 years, space buffs have wondered
who composed the words ``That's one small step for a man'' which
<PERSON>Neil Armstrong</PERSON> said when he stepped on the moon.
   Now, with the one-score anniversary coming up <DATE>July 20</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION>
says that not only were those words his own, but that he composed
them on the spot.
   <ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION>, commander of the Apollo 11 moon mission, was reunited
with his two crew mates for a news conference <DATE>Friday</DATE> to satisfy
requests for interviews in connection with celebrations planned
across the world to mark the event.
   He was asked when exactly he decided on the words ``That's one
small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind,'' which he said
after climbing down the ladder on the lunar lander.
   ``It was a statement that was natural in the sense of the
time,'' <ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION> said. ``I thought about it after we got there.''
   With that he destroyed longstanding rumors in space circles that
some anonymous public relations genius, not <ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION>, created
those words for history.
   <ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION>, along with lunar module pilot <PERSON>Edwin</PERSON> ``Buzz'' <PERSON>Aldrin</PERSON>
and command module pilot <PERSON>Michael Collins</PERSON>, fielded questions from
reporters with humor and self-deprecation for the niche they carved
in the annals of exploration.
   Here are some <ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION> comments:
   _On the use of robots to explore space _ a technique favored by
many scientists: ``Man can be amused and amazed, and a robot can be
neither.''
   _On leaving footprints on the moon that will remain undisturbed
for millennia: ``I had hoped that somebody goes up there some day
and cleans them up.''
   _On how their lives were changed by their adventure: ``Before
<DATE>1969</DATE>, press conferences were much smaller.''
   _On whether the Apollo moon program was a stunt of little value:
``Even if it was a bad idea, I'm glad we did it.''
   All three were asked what moment of their mission they would
choose to relive.
   Aldrin, who just published a book on <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s space program,
answered it would be the <DATE>last 10</DATE> seconds before they touched down
on the lunar surface and the first 10 seconds afterward.
   <ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION> said, ``I would pick a moment when I could look out
the window and see a full Earth.''
   And <PERSON>Collins</PERSON> said it would be the moment when he saw the lunar
module returning from the moon's surface against the background of
the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> floating in the black of space.
   In his view, he said, were both the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> with three billion
people and the moon ship with only two.

   Several times in the final minutes
before man first touched down on the moon's surface, the astronauts
and ground controllers came close to aborting the attempt.
   ``There were some scary things during that descent,'' astronaut
<PERSON>Neil Armstrong</PERSON> recalled later. ``Especially those computer alarms.''
   After separating from <PERSON>Mike Collins</PERSON> and the mother ship, <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION>,
<ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Buzz Aldrin</PERSON>, in the lunar module <LOCATION>Eagle</LOCATION>, swooped behind
the backside of the moon, out of radio contact with <ORGANIZATION>Mission Control</ORGANIZATION>
in <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION>.
   Armstrong fired the descent engine on the farside, 70 minutes
before the planned touchdown.
   Ground controllers did not know until <TIME>39 minutes later</TIME>, when
<ORGANIZATION>Eagle</ORGANIZATION> returned to radio range, whether the engine had fired
successfully to shift the astronauts into an orbital path whose low
point was just 9.8 miles above the surface.
   Once Eagle reached this closest approach, <ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION> had five
seconds to decide whether to ignite the descent engine again to drop
to the surface or to abort and initiate a rendezvous course to
<ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION>.
   As the critical moment approached, <ORGANIZATION>Mission Control</ORGANIZATION> detected two
problems that could cause an abort.
   ``We were getting broken voice and telemetry communications,''
recalls <PERSON>Gene Kranz</PERSON>, the Apollo 11 flight director who today is
director of flight operations at the <ORGANIZATION>Johnson Space Center</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION>.
   ``Immediately it flashed through my mind this basic ground rule
that I had to be sure that whatever happened, we had to have data
during this critical attempt at descent and landing,'' <PERSON>Kranz</PERSON> said.
``The data was broken, but the key stuff was there. And we were able
to improve it by making a minor change in the LM's attitude.''
   At the same time, <PERSON>Stephen Bales</PERSON>, the 26-year-old guidance officer
in the control center, detected the module ``was going toward the
moon about 15 miles an hour faster than the guidance computer
thought it was because some navigation errors had been introduced
into the system.
   ``Now 15 miles an hour doesn't sound like much, but we had an
abort limit that I was supposed to call that said if this thing grew
to 23 miles an hour, I had to stop the landing. I had to say no
go,'' <PERSON>Bales</PERSON> said.
   That much excess speed would have pushed Eagle outside the
previously photographed landing zone in the <ORGANIZATION>Sea of Tranquillity</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``We did not want them trying to land in unfamiliar territory,''
said <PERSON>Bales</PERSON>, who today is chief of the systems division at the
<ORGANIZATION>Johnson Space Center</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION>. Fortunately, the spacecraft did not
gain additional speed.
   These problems resolved, <ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION> was given the green light to
again start the descent engine. He pressed the button. Landing on
the <ORGANIZATION>Sea of Tranquillity</ORGANIZATION> was 12 minutes away.
   Suddenly, computer alarm lights began flashing in the cabin. The
guidance computer was overtaxed, and <ORGANIZATION>Eagle</ORGANIZATION> again was rapidly
approaching an abort situation.
   ``The computer was on a fixed one-second cycle,'' <PERSON>Bales</PERSON> said.
``It had to navigate, it had to guide, it had to display data to the
crew, it had to trim the engine. And if it couldn't get all its jobs
done in one second, it gave this overload alarm.
   ``Fortunately, the guys who programmed it were very sharp and
they put the least needed tasks at the bottom of the stack and the
most needed at the top,'' he said. ``We had seen the same thing in a
simulator run just two weeks before the launch. And because I could
see the computer was solving all the right problems, I told <PERSON>Gene
Kranz</PERSON> to have the crew ignore the alarms and keep going.''
   <PERSON>Chris Kraft</PERSON>, the flight operations director who now is a private
aerospace consultant, said in a recent interview that <PERSON>Bales</PERSON>'
contribution was ``absolutely vital.''
   ``Without his ability to see into the operations of that
computer, we would have waved off, aborted,'' <PERSON>Kraft</PERSON> said.
   Another abort situation faced <ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Aldrin</PERSON> as they neared
the surface. Because of the navigation error, they were coming in
about four miles west of their planned touchdown point. Instead of
the relatively smooth area they'd expected, <ORGANIZATION>Eagle</ORGANIZATION> was coming down in
an area strewn with boulders and pocked with craters.
   Armstrong took manual control and began flying the module like a
helicopter, searching for a smooth spot.
   ``We didn't know what was going on,'' <PERSON>Bales</PERSON> said. ``We knew he
was close to the surface but was not landing. He was running out of
gas, and I said ... we're going to have to abort for gas.''
   Armstrong had only about 12 seconds of fuel left when he dropped
Eagle onto the surface.
   ``<LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Tranquillity Base</ORGANIZATION> here. The Eagle has landed,''
<ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION> reported.
   ``<PERSON>Roger</PERSON>, Tranquillity,'' said astronaut <PERSON>Charlie Duke</PERSON>, the capsule
communicator in the control center. ``We copy you on the ground. You
got a bunch of guys about to turn blue. We're breathing again.''
   Everyone in the control center was cheering, applauding. Flight
director <PERSON>Kranz</PERSON> suddenly realized discipline was breaking down, that
the team had to be ready to make split-second decisions in case the
astronauts had to make a sudden takeoff from the moon.
   ``All right, everyone,'' he said. ``Get settled down. There's a
lot of work to do.''
   Within seconds, they were preparing for a possible emergency
liftoff.
   Radio data indicated pressure in a descent engine fuel line,
apparently because it was frozen.
   ``That started sounding pretty bad,'' <PERSON>Bales</PERSON> recalled. ``Gene
called down to me and said, `I don't have time to follow what you're
doing because I've got to follow this freezing problem. You just
make sure you've got all the right stuff loaded into the computer
because we may be lifting off.' That really bothered me because it
would be a shame if we had to lift off now.
   ``As we were loading the right insertion velocity, azimuth and
other things into the LM computer, the line that they were talking
about ruptured,'' <PERSON>Bales</PERSON> said. ``It caused no damage and because it
was on the no-longer-needed descent engine, everything was OK. That
was a big, big, big relief. They stayed on the moon.''

<TEXT>
   Two of the three Apollo 8 astronauts reminisced
<DATE>Tuesday</DATE> about their mission around the <DATE>moon 20 years ago this month</DATE>
_ a feat they said helped lift the nation out of despair at a trying
time in its history.
   ``You have to remember the time span of when Apollo 8 went up,
which was the end of <DATE>1968</DATE> ... not a very stellar year here in this
country,'' <PERSON>James Lovell</PERSON>, who served as command module pilot,
recalled at the <ORGANIZATION>Museum of Science and Industry</ORGANIZATION>. The spacecraft's
command module is on loan there from the <ORGANIZATION>National Air and Space
Museum</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>.
   ``<PERSON>Bobby Kennedy</PERSON> was assasinated, <PERSON>Martin Luther King</PERSON> ... the
<LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> war was going on, the Democrtaic convention in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> ...
we had all sorts of riots _ and it was sort of a down year,'' <PERSON>Lovell</PERSON>
added.
   ``It was some sort of project or an achievement that everybody
could look up to ... it was a goal that you could go outside and see
the moon and know that the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> had finally put a
spacecraft around the moon ...
   ``It couldn't have happened at a better time,'' he said.
   Joining <PERSON>Lovell</PERSON> at the museum was <PERSON>Frank Borman</PERSON>, the Apollo 8
commander. The third astronaut on the mission was <PERSON>William Anders</PERSON>.
   Apollo 8 is perhaps best remembered for footage broadcast
internationally of the three astronauts reading passages from the
biblical book of Genesis on Christmas Eve <DATE>1968</DATE>, with a stunning view
of the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> from 250,000 miles away.
   ``Up to that point it was the largest audience that had ever
listened to a human voice,'' <PERSON>Lovell</PERSON> recalled
   The mission, launched <DATE>Dec. 21, 1968</DATE>, hurled the three astronauts
25,000 miles an hour, a speed no human had endured. During the
six-day space flight _ then the longest on record _ the men circled
the moon 10 times, photographing potential sites for future Apollo
landings there.
   The Apollo 11 mission _ the first to put a man on the moon _
landed <DATE>six months later</DATE>, on <DATE>July 20, 1969</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Borman</PERSON> recalled the Apollo program as generating ``almost a
nationalistic fervor'' that faded as space flights became blase.
   <PERSON>Borman</PERSON>, 60, left the space program in <DATE>1970</DATE> and took the helm at
<ORGANIZATION>Eastern Airlines</ORGANIZATION>, where he served as chairman for 11 years until his
resignation in <DATE>1986</DATE>. He currently serves as vice chairman at <ORGANIZATION>Texas
Air</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>Lovell</PERSON>, also 60, resigned from the space program in <DATE>1973</DATE> and
currently serves as executive vice president at <ORGANIZATION>Centel Business
Systems</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>.
   ``Apollo 8, I think, will always be the single most highlight of
my professional life,'' <PERSON>Borman</PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
   <PERSON>Neil A. Armstrong</PERSON> and <PERSON>Edwin E.</PERSON> ``Buzz'' <PERSON>Aldrin
Jr.</PERSON> thanked <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s rocket fuel researchers <DATE>Thursday</DATE> night during a
celebration marking this month's 20th anniversary of the first
manned landing on the moon.
   ``We were participants and witness to the birth of a new human
era,'' <ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION> said in brief remarks to several hundred people at
the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Lewis Research
Center</ORGANIZATION>, which helped develop rocket fuel for the Apollo 11 flight.
   <ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION>, commander of the three-man Apollo 11 crew, and <PERSON>Aldrin</PERSON>
said present and past researchers at the center had been
instrumental in helping them accomplish the first manned lunar
landing on <DATE>July 20, 1969</DATE>.
   ``Their contributions were of critical importance to our
success,'' <ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION> said.
   Aldrin, who followed <ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION> out of the Eagle landing craft
onto the moon's surface, said he has expected for more than a year
that the 20th anniversary of the Apollo 11 landing would have
special meaning.
   ``I sense that the 20th anniversary is going to mean a lot for
this nation,'' said <PERSON>Aldrin</PERSON>, who said it was unfortunate that the
nation hasn't sent a manned craft to the moon since Apollo 17 in
<DATE>1972</DATE>.
   Aldrin called for development of a space port which would serve
as a stopover point in space using different types of transportation.

<HEAD>Some Experimental Instruments Left on Moon Are Still Working</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A laser reflection experiment that scientists
compared to using a rifle to hit a moving dime two miles away is the
only instrument on the moon from the Apollo program still working,
<ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> officials said <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
   The device, called a laser ranging retro-reflector, is used
regularly to reflect laser beamss aimed at it from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, said
officials at <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in <LOCATION>Pasadena</LOCATION>.
   One was set in the lunar dust in the <ORGANIZATION>Sea of Tranquility</ORGANIZATION> 20 years
ago by astronauts <PERSON>Neil A. Armstrong</PERSON> and <PERSON>Edwin E.</PERSON> ``Buzz'' <PERSON>Aldrin
Jr.</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION> said.
   ``One of the reasons why it's still being used is because there's
no energy required on the moon for it to be used,'' said <PERSON>Jean
Dickey</PERSON>, supervisor of the <ORGANIZATION>Space Geodetic Science and Applications
Group</ORGANIZATION> at the laboratory.
   Similar reflectors were left elsewhere on the moon by Apollo 14
and Apollo 15, and by Lunakhod 2, an unmanned Soviet lander, and all
four still are used by three ground stations on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Dickey</PERSON> said.
   ``It's the only experiment from the Apollo program that is still
working,'' she said.
   A solar-powered instrument package also was left on the moon to
transmit data back to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> by Apollo 11, and each of the five
successful lunar landings placed nuclear-powered instrument stations
on the moon.
   But all were shut down during the mid-1970s, as budget cuts made
it impossible to continue processing data transmitted from the moon,
said <PERSON>Charles Redmond</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>.
   The laser ranging retro-reflector is the moving dime in
scientists' rifle-shooting analogy, and was designed to reflect
laser pulses fired from the <ORGANIZATION>McDonald Observatory</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Fort Davis</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>. The idea was to measure the round-trip travel time of a pulse
of light from the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> to the moon and back.
   The information can be used to calculate distances with
unprecedented accuracy, not only from the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> to the moon, but
between particular observatories on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Dickey</PERSON> said.
   ``When you think that we can measure the distance from the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>
to the moon to within three centimeters, about an inch, it's really
pretty incredible,'' <PERSON>Dickey</PERSON> said.
   Among other things, experiments have shown that the moon is
gradually pulling away from the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, at about 1{ inches a year.
   Scientists using the lunar reflectors also have measured how the
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s continental plates are slowly drifting. They found that the
atmosphere, tides and <ORGANIZATION>Earth</ORGANIZATION>'s core cause variations in the length of
a day, varying by about one-thousandth of a second over a year.
   ``There's been a tremendous growth in our accuracy,'' <PERSON>Dickey</PERSON>
said. Twenty years ago, ``the original ranges were with an accuracy
of meters.''
   Improvements in accuracy were made possible primarily by the
placement of additional reflectors on the moon, and of two
additional observatories, in <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Dickey</PERSON> said.
   The reflectors are too small to be seen from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, so even when
the laser is correctly aligned on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> it is a challenge to
actually hit the lunar target, laboratory officials said.
   The amount of light reflected back to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> is very small, <PERSON>Dickey</PERSON>
said, and usually is measured in photons, the fundamental unit of
light.

<TEXT>
   Twenty years after the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> put men on
the moon, the Soviets have admitted they raced to get there first,
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> scientists say.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Massachusetts Institute of Technology</ORGANIZATION> released photographs
of a landing craft and a module built _ but never used _ to put
cosmonauts on the moon and bring them back to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   The pictures were taken last month by one of a group of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
aeronautics engineers who were shown the equipment while touring
the <ORGANIZATION>Moscow Aviation Institute</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``We are almost positive that we are the first Westerners to
have seen this,'' said <PERSON>Edward F. Crawley</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>MIT</ORGANIZATION>.
   While many believed that the Soviets wanted to reach the moon
first, they long denied that they were in the race.
   ``What's newsworthy is they are just now admitting that they
were trying to get to the moon. They always denied it,'' said <PERSON>Lee
Saegesser</PERSON>, archivist at the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space
Adminsitration</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION>
   The Soviets first acknowledged the lunar program in <DATE>October</DATE>,
when the newspaper Pravda published an interview with <PERSON>Vasily P.
Mishin</PERSON>, its chief designer.
   The Soviets told the American professors that the spacecraft was
ready to fly the year before the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Apollo 11 mission reached the
moon in <DATE>1969</DATE>. But the project was abandoned because of difficulty
perfecting the rocket booster that would have carried some of the
equipment into space.
   The Americans said the Soviets were nonchalant about showing off
the hardware.
   ``It was off hand,'' said <PERSON>Jack L. Kerrebrock</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>MIT</ORGANIZATION>'s acting dean
of engineering, who snapped the pictures.
   ``They took us into the room that houses this hardware to show
it to us as part of their educational program. Indeed, this is how
it's used by students. They crawl around it and make drawings of
it.''
   The Americans said the equipment resembled the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> landing
craft except for two major details: The Soviet setup required two
rockets rather than one to carry it into space. And it would have
have carried one man rather than two to the lunar surface.
   The Americans were shown the equipment by their <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> host,
professor <PERSON>Oleg Alifanov</PERSON>. The Americans _ five from <ORGANIZATION>MIT</ORGANIZATION> and one from
<ORGANIZATION>California Institute of Technology</ORGANIZATION> _ were in the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> to
help set up an exchange program with the Soviet aerospace institute.
   <PERSON>Crawley</PERSON> said the Soviets showed a ``mixture of pride that they
had built it and sorrow that they had never used it and concern
that no one had ever heard about it.''
   Americans <PERSON>Neil Armstrong</PERSON> and <PERSON>Edwin Aldrin</PERSON> were the first to set
foot on the moon on <DATE>July 20, 1969</DATE>. The era ended <DATE>three years later</DATE>
when Apollo 17 astronauts made the sixth and final lunar landing.
   The Americans said the Soviets told them the lunar lander part
of the mission was ready to go in <DATE>1968</DATE>, and they were under
pressure to hurry because of the Apollo successes. However,
setbacks in the development of the Soviet's N1 booster rocket
delayed the mission.
   They said the moon program was put on hold in <DATE>1972</DATE> and canceled
<DATE>two years later</DATE>. The Soviets then gave priority to their space
station project.
   The Americans saw the Soviet equipment on <DATE>Nov. 27</DATE>, and <ORGANIZATION>MIT</ORGANIZATION>
released <ORGANIZATION>Kerrebrock</ORGANIZATION>'s photos <DATE>Sunday</DATE>.
   The N1 booster would have carried the lunar landing craft into
space, while a <ORGANIZATION>Proton</ORGANIZATION> rocket would have lifted a spacecraft
intended to bring the cosmonauts back to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   The Americans said the Soviet landing craft, complete with
extendable landing legs, was designed much like the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> version.
   ``There is a lot of similarity due to form and function,'' said
<PERSON>Crawley</PERSON>. ``It's the natural form that something that would land on
the moon with men on it would have.''
   Besides <PERSON>Kerrebrock</PERSON> and <PERSON>Crawley</PERSON>, others who saw the equipment
were <PERSON>Lawrence R. Young</PERSON>, <PERSON>Leon Trilling</PERSON> and <PERSON>Daniel E. Hastings</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>MIT</ORGANIZATION>
and <ORGANIZATION>Frank Marble of Caltech</ORGANIZATION>.

   <PERSON>Neil Armstrong</PERSON>, the first man on the
moon, withstood the pressure of fame. <PERSON>Buzz Aldrin</PERSON>, the second
moon-walker, was not so lucky.
   After they returned to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> as heroes, along with pilot <PERSON>Michael
Collins</PERSON> who had stayed in lunar orbit, there were months of public
appearances, goodwill visits abroad and seemingly endless interviews
and autograph signing.
   The three Apollo 11 crewmen remained with <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> for awhile.
   In <DATE>1971</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION> retreated to the privacy he craved. He also
realized a dream to teach, becoming a professor of aerospace
engineering at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Cincinnati</ORGANIZATION>.
   After nine years at the university he became an aerospace
consultant. Today he is chairman of <ORGANIZATION>CTA Inc.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Lebanon</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, a
computer systems company. Now 58, he and his wife, <PERSON>Jan</PERSON>, live on a
farm near <LOCATION>Lebanon</LOCATION>.
   Aldrin had trouble handling the post-Apollo 11 celebrations and
subsequent disappointments when he returned to active military duty
with the <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``My depression was brought on by being thrust into the
uncomfortable area of public relations, followed by a period of
wondering where you fit in after being an astronaut on the moon,''
<PERSON>Aldrin</PERSON> said.
   An <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> colonel, in <DATE>1971</DATE> he was named commander of the
<ORGANIZATION>Aerospace Research Pilots School</ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION>Edwards Air Force Base</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION> _
``a school I didn't know anything about'' after being away from the
service 10 years. He said his previous military training had not
prepared him to be a leader.
   Eight months later, <PERSON>Aldrin</PERSON> checked into a military hospital in
<LOCATION>San Antonio</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>. ``I was on my way to having a good old-fashioned
American nervous breakdown. I realized it and asked for help.''
   He went through bouts with mental illness and alcoholism but
recovered from and lectured on both. During this bad period he was
divorced, remarried and divorced again. He wrote a book, ``Return to
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>,'' about those troubled times.
   After his recovery he retired from the <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> and became an
aerospace consultant. Today, at 59, he has remarried and is
president of his own Los Angeles-based firm, <ORGANIZATION>Research &amp; Engineering</ORGANIZATION>.
He is author of a recently published book about his Apollo 11
experience, ``Men From Earth.''
   Collins left <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>January 1970</DATE> to become assistant secretary
of state for public affairs. A year later he joined the <ORGANIZATION>Smithsonian</ORGANIZATION>
Institution as director of the <ORGANIZATION>National Air and Space Museum</ORGANIZATION>,
overseeing the building of the museum, which opened in <DATE>1976</DATE>.
   In <DATE>1980</DATE>, <PERSON>Collins</PERSON> became vice president of the <ORGANIZATION>Vought Corporation</ORGANIZATION>,
and in <DATE>1985</DATE> be became president of his own company, <ORGANIZATION>Michael Collins
Associates</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, where he and wife Pat live.
   ``I'm trying to make a living as a writer,'' <PERSON>Collins</PERSON>, 58, said
recently. He has written ``Carrying the Fire'' and ``Liftoff,'' two
highly acclaimed books about the space program. ``I'm currently
writing a book on Mars.''

<TEXT>
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> is laying the groundwork to send the next
generation of astronauts beyond the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s orbit early in the <DATE>21st
century</DATE>, with missions to Mars and a space station on a Martian moon
among the possibilities.
   In a report released <DATE>Monday</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space
Administration</ORGANIZATION> said the nation must make a ``modest investment of
resources'' during the <DATE>1990s</DATE> to prepare the nation for a range of
opportunities in space.
   ``This ability is critical to <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> leadership in
space,'' said the report titled, ``Beyond Earth's Boundaries: Human
Exploration of the Solar System in the 21st Century.''
   The report examined several strategies for exploring the inner
reaches of the solar system, including establishing a manned lunar
observatory, setting up a space station on the Martian moon Phobos
or sending astronauts to the red planet itself early in the next
century.
   The ambitious blueprint addresses President <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>'s directive on
space policy issued last <DATE>January</DATE>. The directive sets as a long-range
goal ``to expand human presence and activity beyond <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> orbit into
the solar system.''
   <PERSON>Frank Martin</PERSON>, assistant administrator of <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Office of
Exploration</ORGANIZATION>, said ``there's every indication'' the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>
administration will support that policy.
   The underpinnings of any strategy to send space explorers to the
moon and beyond in the next two decades will be increased <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>
funding for development of new technology, life sciences research,
unmanned robotic missions, development of a new fleet of launch
vehicles able to lift heavier loads, and continued commitment to
Space Station Freedom, which is planned for Earth orbit in the
mid-1990s.
   If those conditions are met, the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> could send
astronauts to Phobos in <DATE>2003</DATE> or to Mars in <DATE>2007</DATE> or establish by <DATE>2005</DATE>
a lunar base from which astronauts could build a Mars outpost in
<DATE>2015</DATE>, said <PERSON>John Aaron</PERSON>, who headed the <ORGANIZATION>Office of Exploration</ORGANIZATION> during
production of the report.
   <PERSON>Aaron</PERSON> said the agency has not developed reliable cost estimates
for the missions studied in the report. ``We are not talking about
missions that are cheap,'' he said, but ``we think these are
affordable.''
   <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> said such missions probably could be accomplished at less
real cost than the Apollo program, which put <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> astronauts on the
moon in <DATE>1969</DATE>. At its height, the Apollo program cost about <PERCENT>4 percent</PERCENT>
of the federal budget annually, which in today's dollars would be
about <MONEY>$25 billion</MONEY>, he said.
   ``You can't do the civil space program on the cheap,'' he said,
noting the nation now spends about <MONEY>$11 billion</MONEY> annually on <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>
programs. The fiscal <DATE>1989</DATE> federal budget is about <MONEY>$1.1 trillion</MONEY>.
   ``We're not a poor nation. We can figure out how to do these
things if they're important to us,'' he said, adding that
international cooperation could help support these missions.
   <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> must leap many technological hurdles before it
can accomplish the goal of establishing a permanent human presence
in space, but ``I don't see any show stoppers there.''
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Project Pathfinder, under whose umbrella much of the
research will be done, gets <MONEY>$40 million</MONEY> this year and the same
amount next year, despite <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s request for <MONEY>$100 million</MONEY>. <PERSON>Martin</PERSON>
said annual funding for the program must increase to <MONEY>$100 million</MONEY>
soon.
   The report focused on four case studies for sending astronauts to
the moon, Phobos and Mars. One scenario would send astronauts to
Phobos and then on to Mars; another would launch astronauts directly
to Mars; a third would establish a manned observatory on the far
side of the moon; and a fourth would use an outpost on the moon as a
stepping stone to Mars.
   Aaron, who is now special assistant to the director at <ORGANIZATION>Johnson
Space Center</ORGANIZATION>, emphasized that the four case studies are not proposed
missions, but rather vehicles for assessing exploration techniques
and validating assumptions.
   A key finding, <PERSON>Aaron</PERSON> said, is that a mission to Phobos could
significantly offset the scale and uncertainties of a direct mission
to Mars.
   An Earth-to-Mars mission would require many new technologies,
including advanced propulsion and braking systems, and would require
advanced operations such as in-orbit assembly, long-term storage and
in-orbit transfer of propellant. Much work in the life sciences also
would be needed, and because the mission would last more than 14
months artificial gravity might be needed to maintain the health of
the crew, the report said.
   Phobos is believed to be an asteroid ``captured'' by <ORGANIZATION>Mars</ORGANIZATION>'
gravity and is thought to contain a substantial amount of water and
carbon-based materials, which could offer potential sources of
rocket fuel that could be tapped for exploratory missions to Mars.
   ``Phobos is an attractive way to go to Mars,'' <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> said. ``I
would be surprised if Phobos isn't a part of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> going to
Mars.''

<P>
In the early-morning darkness of a <DATE>spring</DATE> day in <DATE>1969</DATE>, a convoy carrying a 
strange-looking cargo pulled out of a <ORGANIZATION>Rockwell International</ORGANIZATION> facility and 
snaked its way along <LOCATION>Seal Beach Boulevard</LOCATION> to the nearby <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> dock. 
</P>
<P>
The trucks and trailers were transporting a large section of the huge <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> V 
rocket that would take man to the moon -- and back to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> -- for the first 
time ever. 
</P>
<P>
The booster rocket, placed on its side aboard a specially built transporter, 
was so large that power lines had to be lifted and street lights twisted out of 
the way to allow the convoy to pass. It was then loaded onto a barge at the 
<ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> dock for a long journey to the launch pad at <LOCATION>Cape Kennedy</LOCATION> (now <LOCATION>Cape 
Canaveral</LOCATION>), <LOCATION>Fla</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
On <DATE>July 16, 1969</DATE>, the Apollo 11 spacecraft lifted off with astronauts <PERSON>Neil A. 
Armstrong</PERSON>, <PERSON>Edwin E.</PERSON> (Buzz) <PERSON>Aldrin Jr.</PERSON> and <PERSON>Michael Collins</PERSON> aboard, and on <DATE>July 
20, 1969</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION> became the first man to set foot on the moon. 
</P>
<P>
"Having a role in something as important, as elegant and as challenging as 
putting a man on the moon was very satisfying," said <PERSON>William Dean</PERSON>, 59, who 
supervised the engineers and technicians who worked around the clock to perfect 
<ORGANIZATION>Rockwell</ORGANIZATION>'s portion of the spacecraft. "We knew we were part of something that 
would be recorded in history as a milestone as important as almost anything 
that had happened in mankind." 
</P>
<P>
Dean was just one of thousands of <LOCATION>Orange County</LOCATION> workers who helped put the 
first men on the moon. At a time when "Midnight Cowboy" was playing on local 
movie screens and "Rowan and <PERSON>Martin</PERSON>'s Laugh-In" was perched atop the TV 
ratings, county aerospace workers were designing and building some of the key 
hardware for Apollo 11's half-million-mile journey to the moon. The <LOCATION>Orange 
County</LOCATION> operations of <ORGANIZATION>Rockwell</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>McDonnell Douglas</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>TRW Inc.</ORGANIZATION> performed major 
work on Apollo 11, and dozens of smaller local subcontractors made 
contributions too. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Three Stages 
</P>
<P>
Because no single rocket was powerful enough to carry a spacecraft to the moon 
by itself, the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION> devised a plan for 
three rockets, or stages, that would be strapped together. Each stage would be 
discarded after it performed its task. 
</P>
<P>
Rockwell plants in <LOCATION>Seal Beach</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Downey</PERSON> built <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> V's second-stage rocket, 
which would propel the craft to an altitude of 103 nautical miles, then be 
jettisoned so that the third stage could take over. (The first-stage rocket 
would launch Apollo 11, then quickly fall away.) <ORGANIZATION>Rockwell</ORGANIZATION> also built monitoring 
and control systems for the spacecraft. 
</P>
<P>
The third-stage rocket was built by <ORGANIZATION>McDonnell Douglas</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Huntington Beach</LOCATION>. That 
rocket would bring the spacecraft into an orbit around the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, then fire its 
engines again to propel the craft toward the moon. 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>TRW</ORGANIZATION> San <PERSON>Juan Capistrano</PERSON> plant developed the engines used to lower the 
landing module to the surface of the moon. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Exciting Time 
</P>
<P>
The men and women who were part of the Apollo space program remember it as a 
time of hard work and extraordinary challenge, and they recalled the excitement 
of participating in what perhaps would be the most daring exploration ever 
undertaken. 
</P>
<P>
"In those days, everyone was so busy and spirits were so high that it was 
really a wonderful place to work," said <PERSON>George V. Butler</PERSON>, an executive in 
<ORGANIZATION>McDonnell Douglas</ORGANIZATION>'s space division in <LOCATION>Huntington Beach</LOCATION> during the Apollo 
program. "Those were some of the best years." 
</P>
<P>
President <PERSON>John F. Kennedy</PERSON> had issued the challenge to the nation in <DATE>1961</DATE>: Land 
a man on the moon before the end of the decade. Indeed, in a speech to <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> 
in <DATE>May</DATE> of that year, <PERSON>Kennedy</PERSON> said of the mission, "No single space project in 
this period will be more exciting or more impressive to mankind or more 
important for the long-range exploration of space, and none will be so 
difficult or so expensive to accomplish." 
</P>
<P>
The Apollo 11 mission marked the climax of an unprecedented nine-year effort to 
take man to the moon and back -- and to do it before the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> did. 
Although the previous Apollo missions had tested many of the technologies used 
in Apollo 11, landing a spacecraft on the moon and bringing it back would be a 
venture into uncharted territory. 
</P>
<P>
"No one knew what the surface of the moon was like," said <PERSON>Butler</PERSON>, now executive 
director of the <ORGANIZATION>McDonnell Douglas</ORGANIZATION> space station division in <LOCATION>Huntington Beach</LOCATION>. 
"We didn't know if <ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION> was going to sink to his knees or what." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Feeling of Importance' 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>TRW</ORGANIZATION> plant was charged with testing the engines used on the <LOCATION>Eagle</LOCATION>, the lunar 
module that would take <ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Aldrin</PERSON> from the command module to the 
lunar surface. Those engines would play a critical role, performing as both 
brake and booster for the lunar module, and they had to allow <ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION> and 
<PERSON>Aldrin</PERSON> to change the direction of the module in case they needed to change 
landing sites at the last moment. 
</P>
<P>
"There was always that feeling of importance," said <PERSON>Benjamin Cruz</PERSON>, a 
33-year-old supervisor on the <ORGANIZATION>TRW</ORGANIZATION> program in <DATE>1969</DATE>. "We knew we could do it. We 
were pushing the technological edge forward. Our reputation was at stake. I 
don't think there were doubts it could be done, but it was not an easy thing to 
do." 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, <ORGANIZATION>TRW</ORGANIZATION> did its job well. Just as <ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Aldrin</PERSON> were 
preparing to land on the moon, they saw that the intended landing site in the 
Sea of Tranquility was not the clear plain <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> planners had thought. Rather, 
it was a treacherous field covered with boulders the size of automobiles. The 
effort to land would provide some of the most tense moments of the mission. 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>TRW</ORGANIZATION> engines performed flawlessly, enabling <ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION> to take manual control 
of the Eagle and steer the spindly looking module into a safer area four miles 
west of the intended site -- and with less than 10 seconds' worth of fuel left. 
</P>
<P>
"<LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION>, Tranquility Base here," <ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION> reported back to <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> mission 
control in <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION> after the 47-minute descent. "The Eagle has landed." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Cigars Passed Around 
</P>
<P>
McDonnell Douglas</ORGANIZATION>' <PERSON>Butler</PERSON> was watching at mission control in <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION> as the 
Eagle set down on the powdery lunar surface. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a very tense and exciting time," said <PERSON>Butler</PERSON>, who recalled how he 
became anxious himself as the <ORGANIZATION>Eagle</ORGANIZATION>'s fuel ran low and as <ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Aldrin</PERSON> 
"seemed to take forever" to put on the spacesuits they would wear for the 
moonwalk. 
</P>
<P>
Those breathless moments turned into sighs of relief and shouts of jubilation 
as <ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION> placed his left boot on the moon's surface, did not sink, and 
uttered the words, "That's one small step for a man, one giant leap for 
mankind." 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone got out cigars and puffed on them, including me," <PERSON>Butler</PERSON> recalled. "I 
sort of turned green, not being a cigar smoker." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Goose-Bump Time 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>David A. Forge</PERSON>, 55, a test engineer for <ORGANIZATION>McDonnell Douglas</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Huntington Beach</LOCATION> 
on the Apollo program, recalled watching the moonwalk at home with his wife, 
<PERSON>Delores</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember sitting there with the biggest goose bumps I've ever had in my life 
and watching the tears running down my wife's cheeks," <PERSON>Forge</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an extremely hectic time, and we usually worked around the clock, six 
or seven days a week," said <PERSON>Robert G. Minor</PERSON>, then an engineering manager for 
the Apollo program and now president of <ORGANIZATION>Rockwell</ORGANIZATION>'s space division in <LOCATION>Downey</LOCATION>. 
"But it was a very high-spirited time because this was a high-visibility 
program with lots of public support." 
</P>
<P>
The walk itself marked "a great day" for the nation, Minor said. "I look back 
at that as the pinnacle of when the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> was at the top of the 
technological tree. I don't think anybody on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> compared to us. Obviously, a 
lot has happened since then." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the attention generated by the mission, <PERSON>Cruz</PERSON> said he and his fellow 
workers were too busy doing their jobs to fully comprehend the significance of 
it all at the time. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Different Perspective 
</P>
<P>
"You couldn't stand back and look at it like the nation did," <PERSON>Cruz</PERSON> said. "The 
realization comes after. Then we said, 'My gosh, look what we did.' " 
</P>
<P>
The lunar lander, after returning <ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION> and Aldrin to the orbiting command 
module piloted by <PERSON>Collins</PERSON>, was discarded, crashing into the moon's surface, 
where it will remain forever. 
</P>
<P>
Cruz cherishes the thought that he will be able to tell his 3-year-old 
granddaughter that a piece of his work will stay on the moon forever after. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Apollo program provided exciting and challenging work, its demands 
sometimes took a toll on family life. 
</P>
<P>
"All of us who worked on the Apollo program went through a lot of conscience 
problems associated with our responsibilities to our families and jobs," said 
Dean, the former <ORGANIZATION>Rockwell</ORGANIZATION> manager who today is president of a <ORGANIZATION>Silicon Valley</ORGANIZATION> 
aerospace firm. "We knew that our jobs were going to make the difference 
between the crew surviving a trip to the moon and getting back safely. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe that was part of the reason why I hauled my children out to the TV to 
watch the moon landing," <PERSON>Dean</PERSON> said. "I wanted them to understand, in some 
fashion, that my absence had counted for something."
