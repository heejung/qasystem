   Director <PERSON>Ingmar Bergman</PERSON> is turning 70,
having reached what he calls the twilight of his career but basking
in a run of theater successes.
   Recuperating from a hip operation, <PERSON>Bergman</PERSON> is quietly
celebrating his <DATE>July 14 birthday</DATE> at his retreat at <ORGANIZATION>Faro</ORGANIZATION>, a rugged
island of beaches and pine trees in the <LOCATION>Baltic Sea</LOCATION>, with some of
his eight children and his fifth wife, <PERSON>Ingrid</PERSON>.
   Bergman, whose films probed emotions and relationships rarely
touched by others, says he has made his last movie. That was his
<DATE>1982</DATE> triumph ``Fanny and <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON>,'' which won four <ORGANIZATION>Academy Awards</ORGANIZATION>.
   But he is hardly slowing down, and has theater productions
scheduled in <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION> until <DATE>1991</DATE>.
   In <DATE>April</DATE> he scored a critical and box office sensation with his
stage production of <PERSON>Eugene O'Neill</PERSON>'s ``Long Day's Journey Into
Night.'' His autobiography, ``Lanterna Magica,'' was a Swedish
bestseller when it was published last year.
   His Swedish-language production of ``Hamlet,'' put in a modern
setting, was panned by some critics here, but was a sensation in
<LOCATION>Florence</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>, and won a critics prize last year in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>. It
played in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> in <DATE>May</DATE>.
   ``Hamlet is on the top 10 list of really good performances,''
<PERSON>Bergman</PERSON> said in a radio interview. ``It is the best I can do, which
means that I have reached quite far with it,''
   His next directing project will be <ORGANIZATION>Shakespeare</ORGANIZATION>'s ``A <DATE>Winter</DATE>'s
Tale,'' at <LOCATION>Stockholm</LOCATION>'s 200-year-old <ORGANIZATION>Royal Dramatic Theater</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>Bergman</PERSON> was not always the cultural hero in <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION> that he is
today. His volcanic temper didn't help.
   ``He used to refer to anyone who didn't throw furniture around
as `inhibited,'' says <PERSON>Gunnel Lindblom</PERSON>, one of his leading ladies.
   In <DATE>1969</DATE> he was fined heavily for hitting a theater critic known
for his sharp reviews.
   ``And it was worth it,'' <PERSON>Bergman</PERSON> said.
   Today he says the critics don't bother him as much.
   ``I don't even get angry,'' he said in the radio interview. ``Of
course when you were young you took it very hard and were very
hurt. But not after 45 years.''
   Now, he says, ``everybody is very kind to me. ... I suppose it
is because I have become old and harmless.''
   His many love affairs, often with women starring in his films,
drew more attention in <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION> than his art. But his latest marriage
_ his fifth _ has lasted since the early <DATE>1970</DATE>'s.
   In his memoirs he regrets what he describes as his earlier
fickleness and attributes it to sexual obsession.
   ``There were very many years of my life when I was so occupied
with what I was doing that I forgot wives and children. Now since I
am older it has been very nice and rewarding to get to know my
children,'' he said.
   <PERSON>Bergman</PERSON> was <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION>'s youngest theater director at 26 when he was
put in charge of the provincial <ORGANIZATION>Helsingborg City Theater</ORGANIZATION> in
southern <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION>. The theatrical tradition, he says, has always been
the real influence on his art.
   He is best known for directing more than 50 films, most of which
he wrote himself. He won three Oscars for best foreign films: ``The
Virgin Spring'' in <DATE>1960</DATE>, ``Through a Glass Darkly'' in <DATE>1962</DATE> and
``Fanny and Alexander.''
   To mark the birthday, the <ORGANIZATION>Swedish Film Institute</ORGANIZATION> published a
special English-language edition of its magazine, <PERSON>Chaplin</PERSON>, paying
homage to the director who made his first film in <DATE>1944</DATE> and who
launched the careers of such international stars as <PERSON>Liv Ulmann</PERSON>,
<PERSON>Bibi Andersson</PERSON> and <PERSON>Max von Sydow</PERSON>.
   ``<PERSON>Bergman</PERSON> is probably the greatest film artist, all things
considered, since the invention of the motion-picture camera,''
wrote <PERSON>Woody Allen</PERSON>, one of a dozen international directors
contributing to the 90-page tribute.
   Sir <PERSON>Richard Attenborough</PERSON>, the British director, said <PERSON>Bergman</PERSON>
``extended the medium (of film) in a manner unequalled by any of
his contemporaries.''
   For some four decades <PERSON>Bergman</PERSON> divided his time between theater
and film, likening the two forums to ``my wife and my mistress.''
After ``Fanny and Alexander'' he said he was giving up his
``mistress'' and devoting himself to the stage. Since then he
produced only one Swedish television film in <DATE>1984</DATE>, ``After the
Repetition.''
   ``Fanny and Alexander'' was a multi-levelled story of a
well-to-do family at the <DATE>turn of the century</DATE>, which appeared to
have traces of <PERSON>Bergman</PERSON>'s own childhood with his clergyman father.
   The film marked <PERSON>Bergman</PERSON>'s return to <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION> after six years in
self-imposed exile in <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION>. In <DATE>1976</DATE> he was hauled away by
police during a rehearsal and accused of tax violations. He was
cleared, but left the country in disgust.
   He is now back at the <ORGANIZATION>Royal Dramatic Theater</ORGANIZATION>, where he saw his
first play at the age of 12 and where he was the director from <DATE>1963</DATE>
to <DATE>1966</DATE>.

<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After quarrels with the tax collector,
<LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION>'s favorite theatrical sons have come home.
   <PERSON>Max von Sydow</PERSON> is back on the Swedish stage after a 14-year
absence. Director <PERSON>Ingmar Bergman</PERSON>, who lived in self-imposed exile
for several years, also is rehearsing a new play.
   Both <PERSON>Bergman</PERSON>, whose brooding, introspective films in the <DATE>1950s</DATE>
and '60s gave Swedish film an international reputation, and von
<PERSON>Sydow</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION>'s most durable actor, left the country because of tax
problems.
   Von <PERSON>Sydow</PERSON>, who lives in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> but comes back every year for
<DATE>summer</DATE> vacation, never thought of himself as an expatriate and has
returned twice to make films.
   ``I'm still totally Swedish,'' he said. ``I still have my roots
here.''
   Swedish taxes, among the highest in the world, are driving young
artists away, he said in an interview. The average Swede pays half
his salary in taxes, and marginal tax on top incomes can run as
high as <PERCENT>78 percent</PERCENT>.
   ``A lot of talent is not used in this country because of this.
If you don't get anything financially out of it, why work here?''
said von <PERSON>Sydow</PERSON>, 58.
   Among his 40 foreign film roles are the Jesuit priest in ``The
Exorcist,'' the assassin in ``Three Days of the Condor,'' and the
artist@husband in <PERSON>Woody Allen</PERSON>'s ``Hannah and Her Sisters.'' He
launched his career abroad in <DATE>1965</DATE> as Jesus in ``The Greatest Story
Ever Told.''
   Von <PERSON>Sydow</PERSON> left <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION> in a huff in <DATE>1973</DATE> after paying what he
said was an unfairly large tax bill. He was assessed <MONEY>$20,050</MONEY> for
allegedly underpaying his taxes. His lawyers took the case to the
<ORGANIZATION>European Human Rights Commission</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1985</DATE>, claiming that the lack of
an appeal mechanism against the tax authorities was an infringement
of his rights. Last year, the Swedish government settled out of
court, repaying him <MONEY>$33,333</MONEY> compensation and <MONEY>$20,000</MONEY> for costs.
   Von <PERSON>Sydow</PERSON> said he is trying to put the tax affair behind him
without bitterness.
   ``I'm trying not to be poisoned by paranoia,'' he said. ``Today
I feel freer than when I left, because this problem is solved and
because I know that if I want to I could work abroad all the time.''
   His ties to his country are stronger than others have shown.
Once Hollywood made stars of <PERSON>Greta Garbo</PERSON> and <PERSON>Ingrid Bergman</PERSON>, they
were gone from <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION> for good.
   Von <PERSON>Sydow</PERSON> is playing at the <ORGANIZATION>Royal Dramatic Theater</ORGANIZATION>, where he
began his acting career 40 years ago and where he met <PERSON>Bergman</PERSON>, with
whom he did 11 films.
   He said one reason for returning to the stage was fascination
with the character he was offered in ``Master Olof,'' an <DATE>1871</DATE> drama
by <PERSON>August Strindberg</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION>'s greatest literary figure.
   He plays a roguish revolutionary during the 16th-century Swedish
Reformation. It's a supporting role, but von <PERSON>Sydow</PERSON> said he doesn't
care. ``It's the best part in the play,'' he said.
   He said he also was drawn by the double anniversary of the royal
theater's 200th year and the 80th year since it moved to its gilded
waterfront building, now a city landmark.
   Working in the Swedish language again ``is wonderful, it's
exciting,'' he said. ``It's still very difficult for me to act in
English, and it always will be. ... It takes a longer time to
really make the lines your own.''
   Last year von <PERSON>Sydow</PERSON>, who does three projects a year, finished
``Pelle the Conqueror,'' his first Swedish-language film in five
years.
   The title role of <LOCATION>Pelle</LOCATION>, a peasant farmhand, could have been
tailored for the tall, blond Swede with a farmer's weatherbeaten
look and huge hands. The role won him the prestigious Swedish
Golden Bug Award as best actor in <DATE>1987</DATE> and two Danish acting
prizes, one by critics and one by the film academy. The film will
be entered in the <LOCATION>Cannes</LOCATION> Film Festival.
   ``It's such a rich character,'' he said. ``He is so vulnerable
and so miserable; he is full of expectations, he is terribly
disappointed, he is very happy, he is furious. ... It's probably
the best part I've ever had.''
   Von <PERSON>Sydow</PERSON> also is directing his first movie, a Danish-language
film called ``Along the Roadside.''
   <PERSON>Bergman</PERSON>, 69, is directing his fifth play since returning from
<LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION>, where he lived for about five years until he came
back in <DATE>1982</DATE> to film the acclaimed ``Fanny and Alexander.''
   In <DATE>1976</DATE>, tax inspectors barged into a rehearsal and took the
famed director away for questioning on suspicion of tax evasion. He
was cleared of all charges, but he wrote in his <DATE>1987</DATE> autobiography
that the incident drove him into a depression that turned to rage
against his country.
   At the same time, he was uncomfortable away from <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION>.
   ``I felt like an invalid who had lost an arm and a leg,'' he
wrote in his autobiography, ``Magic Lantern.''
   ``I longed for the old language, the friends and the
companionship.''
   <PERSON>Bergman</PERSON>'s staging of <PERSON>Eugene O'Neill</PERSON>'s ``Long Day's Journey Into
Night'' reunites him with <PERSON>Bibi Andersson</PERSON> whom he discovered in a
soap advertisement in <DATE>1952</DATE> and launched as an international actress.
   Andersson, 53, left acting for several years to work in peace
causes, but came back to the stage in <DATE>1986</DATE>.

   <PERSON>Ingmar Bergman</PERSON>'s staging of ``Long
Day's Journey Into Night'' is a smash with audiences and critics
more than three decades after the play premiered on the same
<LOCATION>Stockholm</LOCATION> stage.
   The revival of <PERSON>Eugene O'Neill</PERSON>'s classic at the <ORGANIZATION>National Dramatic
Theater</ORGANIZATION> earned what one critic called the best review he ever
wrote. The play opened <DATE>April 17</DATE> and is sold out through <DATE>August</DATE>.
   This triumph for <PERSON>Bergman</PERSON>, who turns 70 on <DATE>July 14</DATE>, comes at a
time the director describes as the twilight of his career. He has
said he has made his last film.
   But his schedule is unusual for a man claiming to approach
retirement. His modernized Swedish-language version of Hamlet won
plaudits in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>. The play goes to <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> in <DATE>June</DATE>.
   He also is preparing <ORGANIZATION>Shakespeare</ORGANIZATION>'s ``A <DATE>Winter</DATE>'s Tale,'' and an
opera to open here in <DATE>1991</DATE>. In <DATE>November</DATE>, he published a
best-selling autobiography, ``Magic Lantern.''
   But seldom in his 50-year career has the applause of his home
critics been louder than for the <PERSON>O'Neill</PERSON> play.
   ``This is sensational. World theater, if anything,'' wrote
<PERSON>Ingmar Bjorksten</PERSON>, drama critic of the <ORGANIZATION>Svenska Dagbladet</ORGANIZATION>, in what he
called his most enthusiastic review ever.
   <PERSON>Bergman</PERSON>'s handling of the play was ``full of human knowledge''
and marked by a ``sympathy and warmth unusual for him.''
   ``Brilliant,'' headlined Aftonbladet, which published three
glowing reviews. It called <PERSON>Bergman</PERSON> ``a brilliant editor'' for
cutting an hour from the original script ``with nothing of
<PERSON>O'Neill</PERSON>'s essentials removed.''
   The play stars <PERSON>Bibi Andersson</PERSON>, whom <PERSON>Bergman</PERSON> launched on an
international career in the <DATE>1950s</DATE> and with whom he had a two-year
affair 30 years ago.
   ``I have never experienced such box office pressure for a play
like this. People are writing and calling from all over the
country, even <LOCATION>Denmark</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Norway</LOCATION>,'' theater director <PERSON>Lars Lofgren</PERSON>
told <ORGANIZATION>The Associated Press</ORGANIZATION>.
   The Dramatic Theater, which celebrates its centennial this year,
was given the rights to stage the world premiere of <PERSON>O'Neill</PERSON>'s
unpublished plays after his death in <DATE>1953</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Tom Olsson</PERSON>, the theater's librarian and an <PERSON>O'Neill</PERSON> scholar, said
that according to the playwright's widow <ORGANIZATION>Carlotta</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>O'Neill</PERSON> was
pleased with the theater's handling of his early plays and their
success on the Swedish stage.
   ``Long Day's Journey'' premiered on <DATE>Feb. 10, 1956</DATE>, and the play
was such a hit that it entered theatrical legend here. It won the
<DATE>1957</DATE> Pulitzer Prize for drama.
   <PERSON>Bergman</PERSON> was absent from the revival's opening night 32 years
later. He said later he was looking after his flu-stricken wife,
<PERSON>Ingrid</PERSON>, and did not want to draw attention from the actors.
   His associates said <PERSON>Bergman</PERSON> also was suffering from a painful
hip which plagued him through the rehearsals and was scheduled for
an operation shortly after the premiere.
   But he received a special ovation when the ensemble bowed to an
empty seat in the first row after their ninth curtain call.
   Bergman's movies, which he began making in the <DATE>1950s</DATE>, won world
acclaim for their brooding explorations of troubled relationships.
   Outraged by an charge of tax evasion which was later dropped,
<PERSON>Bergman</PERSON> lived in self-imposed exile in <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION> for seven
years, before returning home in <DATE>1982</DATE> to direct the film ``Fanny and
Alexander.''
   <PERSON>Bergman</PERSON>'s 70th birthday is likely to be the subject of national
celebrations. Chaplin magazine, published by the Swedish Film
Institute, published a 90-page English-language special edition in
<DATE>April</DATE> with tributes from leading movie directors.
   ``Probably the greatest film artist, all things considered,
since the invention of the motion picture camera,'' said <PERSON>Woody
Allen</PERSON>.

<HEAD>Ingmar Bergman Writes Revealing Play About his Parents</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also in Wednesday AMs report.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARTHUR MAX</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As a child, <PERSON>Ingmar Bergman</PERSON>'s parents
locked him in a dark closet when he disobeyed. To amuse himself, he
beamed a flashlight with a colored light onto the wall and
pretended he was at the movies.
   Now 71, the famed director has written a screenplay about his
father, <PERSON>Erik Bergman</PERSON>, an insecure and depression-prone pastor, and
his mother, <PERSON>Karin</PERSON>, a woman of iron self-discipline who cringed at
any show of love.
   In ``Good Intentions,'' <PERSON>Bergman</PERSON> casts back his memory and his
imagination to the first 10 years of his parent's turbulent
relationship and marriage.
   The play is a six-hour chronicle in four acts, to be shown as a
four-part television series and a two-part movie. Production begins
late next year, and the scheduled premiere will be on Swedish
television Channel One in <DATE>1992</DATE>.
   ``I feel a great need to tell the story of these two people who
are in my blood, my nerves and my genes,'' <PERSON>Bergman</PERSON> said.
   Bergman gave up film direction after his <DATE>1982</DATE> ``Fanny and
<PERSON>Alexander</PERSON>,'' which won four <ORGANIZATION>Academy Awards</ORGANIZATION>. Since then, he has been
busy producing stage plays at the <ORGANIZATION>Royal Dramatic Theater</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Stockholm</LOCATION>, which once rejected him for a job when he was an
aspiring 21-year-old production assistant.
   For ``Good Intentions,'' <PERSON>Bergman</PERSON> vacated the director's chair to
Danish filmmaker <PERSON>Bille August</PERSON>, whose ``Pelle the Conqueror'' won
the <DATE>1989</DATE> Academy Award for best foreign film. <PERSON>Bergman</PERSON> said that
after he saw ``Pelle'' six times, the choice of the 40-year-old
<PERSON>Dane</PERSON> was obvious.
   August called the screenplay ``one of the best love stories I
have ever read. It is a great drama and an honor to take part in
delivering.''
   As evidenced in his confession-like autobiography, ``The Magic
Lantern,'' <PERSON>Bergman</PERSON> has been grappling with confusion for many years
over his feelings for his parents.
   They have appeared on screen before, in some of the best of
<PERSON>Bergman</PERSON>'s 50 films. In ``Fanny and <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON>,'' a soft-spoken
clergymen slowly exposes himself as consumed with fanaticism and
hatred.
   The <DATE>1973</DATE> film ``Cries and Whispers'' is about three sisters and
a servant girl. <PERSON>Bergman</PERSON> has said they represent four aspects of his
mother, whom he was seeking to understand through his characters.
   He nurtured the idea for ``Good Intentions'' ever since
completing ``Fanny and Alexander.'' In his memoirs, he wrote about
his parents from his childhood perspective, which was often brutal
and angry.
   It left him unsatisfied. ``I started writing about all the
dreams and memories of my parents. Finally, I had a script,'' he
said. It took him five months <DATE>last year</DATE> to write it.
   The new film promises a sympathetic look at a young couple, a
theology student and a somewhat spoiled young woman from an
affluent home. The characters have fictional names, which allows
<PERSON>Bergman</PERSON> to play with facts.
   The movie covers the time of the couple's meeting in <DATE>1909</DATE> to the
year of <PERSON>Bergman</PERSON>'s birth in <DATE>1918</DATE>.
   In his memoirs, <PERSON>Bergman</PERSON> wrote about his failure to reach his
parents and his own attempts to hide despair by burying any display
of feeling. His emotions, he said, ``inhabited a closed room and
were produced on command, but never rashly.''
   He was raised according to ``the concepts of sin, confession,
punishment, forgiveness and grace _ concrete factors in
relationships between children, parents and God.''
   He described his father, a Lutheran minister, as ``nervous,
irritable and depressive. ... He was always fretting and given to
violent outbursts of temper.''
   His mother ``was always tense, slept badly and used strong
remedies which had side effects causing restlessness and anxiety.
Like Father, she was haunted by a sense of inadequacy.''
   The book barely touches on his parent's feelings for each other,
but a stormy picture emerges when it does.
   As a child, he recalled seeing them in a fierce argument and
scuffle. ``We didn't know that Mother had gone through a passionate
love affair or that Father suffered from severe depression. Mother
was preparing to break out of her marriage, Father threatening to
take his own life.''
   Divorce in those days was almost unthinkable, especially for a
respected pastor, and the church stepped in to reconcile the couple.
   Yet the reconciliation was mostly for show. ``What was outwardly
an irreproachable picture of good family unity was inwardly misery
and exhausting conflicts,'' he wrote.

<HEAD>Ingmar Bergman Writes Revealing Play About His Parents</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARTHUR MAX</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As a child, <PERSON>Ingmar Bergman</PERSON>'s parents
locked him in a dark closet when he disobeyed. To amuse himself, he
beamed a flashlight with a colored light onto the wall and pretended
he was at the movies.
   Now 71, the famed director has written a screenplay about his
father, <PERSON>Erik Bergman</PERSON>, an insecure and depression-prone pastor, and
his mother, <PERSON>Karin</PERSON>, a woman of iron self-discipline who cringed at
any show of love.
   In ``Good Intentions,'' <PERSON>Bergman</PERSON> casts back his memory and his
imagination to the first 10 years of his parent's turbulent
relationship and marriage.
   The play is a six-hour chronicle in four acts, to be shown as a
four-part television series and a two-part movie. Production begins
late next year, and the scheduled premiere will be on Swedish
television Channel One in <DATE>1992</DATE>.
   ``I feel a great need to tell the story of these two people who
are in my blood, my nerves and my genes,'' <PERSON>Bergman</PERSON> said.
   Bergman gave up film direction after his <DATE>1982</DATE> ``Fanny and
<PERSON>Alexander</PERSON>,'' which won four <ORGANIZATION>Academy Awards</ORGANIZATION>. Since then, he has been
busy producing stage plays at the <ORGANIZATION>Royal Dramatic Theater</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Stockholm</LOCATION>, which once rejected him for a job when he was an aspiring
21-year-old production assistant.
   For ``Good Intentions,'' <PERSON>Bergman</PERSON> vacated the director's chair to
Danish filmmaker <PERSON>Bille August</PERSON>, whose ``Pelle the Conqueror'' won the
<DATE>1989</DATE> Academy Award for best foreign film. <PERSON>Bergman</PERSON> said that after he
saw ``Pelle'' six times, the choice of the 40-year-old <PERSON>Dane</PERSON> was
obvious.
   August called the screenplay ``one of the best love stories I
have ever read. It is a great drama and an honor to take part in
delivering.''
   As evidenced in his confession-like autobiography, ``The Magic
Lantern,'' <PERSON>Bergman</PERSON> has been grappling with confusion for many years
over his feelings for his parents.
   They have appeared on screen before, in some of the best of
<PERSON>Bergman</PERSON>'s 50 films. In ``Fanny and <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON>,'' a soft-spoken
clergymen slowly exposes himself as consumed with fanaticism and
hatred.
   The <DATE>1973</DATE> film ``Cries and Whispers'' is about three sisters and a
servant girl. <PERSON>Bergman</PERSON> has said they represent four aspects of his
mother, whom he was seeking to understand through his characters.
   He nurtured the idea for ``Good Intentions'' ever since
completing ``Fanny and Alexander.'' In his memoirs, he wrote about
his parents from his childhood perspective, which was often brutal
and angry.
   It left him unsatisfied. ``I started writing about all the dreams
and memories of my parents. Finally, I had a script,'' he said. It
took him five months <DATE>last year</DATE> to write it.
   The new film promises a sympathetic look at a young couple, a
theology student and a somewhat spoiled young woman from an affluent
home. The characters have fictional names, which allows <PERSON>Bergman</PERSON> to
play with facts.
   The movie covers the time of the couple's meeting in <DATE>1909</DATE> to the
year of <PERSON>Bergman</PERSON>'s birth in <DATE>1918</DATE>.
   In his memoirs, <PERSON>Bergman</PERSON> wrote about his failure to reach his
parents and his own attempts to hide despair by burying any display
of feeling. His emotions, he said, ``inhabited a closed room and

   He was raised according to ``the concepts of sin, confession,

<HEAD>Sounds of Silince: Sweden Goes Three Minutes Without Culture</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARTHUR MAX</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pavarotti stayed off the stage, movies
stopped in midreel, concert halls were hushed and radio programs
fell silent.
   Cultural life in <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION> came to a halt for three minutes at <TIME>8:15
p.m.</TIME> <DATE>Thursday</DATE> when actors, musicians, dancers, and even librarians
protested what they called the low level of government support.
   Artists in most countries might be envious of the Swedes.
Stockholm, capital of a country of 8.4 million people, has as many
theaters as <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>. Artists can get state grants, but they say it
isn't enough to live on.
   State-supported theaters have launched the careers of director
<PERSON>Ingmar Bergman</PERSON> and actors such as <PERSON>Ingrid Bergman</PERSON>, <PERSON>Max von Sydow</PERSON> and
<PERSON>Ingrid Tulin</PERSON>.
   The nation which awards the Nobel prize for literature sells 2.5
million theater tickets a year, nearly one for every third person.
   In an article published <DATE>Friday</DATE>, actress <PERSON>Bibi Andersson</PERSON> protested
that the cultural assistance were too low, projects were too
vulnerable to cuts, and grants were too snagged in bureaucratic
tangles.
   ``Why do actors have to get swallowed up in bureaucracy? Why do
fiery spirits grow tired?'' she wrote in the Aftonbladet daily.
   ``What we wanted was to make culture an election issue,'' she
said, referring to the <DATE>Sept. 18</DATE> national elections. ``It's a
question of priorities.''
   ``The strike was a success for the artists. They got a lot of
attention and managed to get their message across,'' said <PERSON>Martin
Lindbloom</PERSON>, spokesman of the <ORGANIZATION>Ministry of Education and Culture</ORGANIZATION>.
   In the west coast city of <LOCATION>Goteborg</LOCATION>, touring opera tenor <PERSON>Luciano
Pavarotti</PERSON> delayed the start of his performance by three minutes in
support of the strike. His audience stood in silence during that
time.
   One channel of the state-run television broke into its regular
program for live reports showing movie theaters with darkened
screens, silent stages and a candlelight vigil in <LOCATION>Goteborg</LOCATION> by 400
people. Two radio channels were quiet, while the third played <PERSON>Simon</PERSON>
and <ORGANIZATION>Garfunkel</ORGANIZATION>'s ``Sounds of Silence.''
   At <LOCATION>Stockholm</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>National Dramatic Theater</ORGANIZATION>, the staging of <PERSON>Eugene
O'Neill</PERSON>'s ``Long Day's Journey Into Night'' gave the protest a
unique twist.
   At precisely <TIME>8:15 p.m.</TIME>, the young artist <PERSON>Edmund</PERSON> delivered his
line, ``I'm broke.'' Action froze on stage for three minutes, then
<PERSON>Edmund</PERSON>'s father resumed the play with the reply: ``You're always
broke, and you always will be.''
   Official figures cited by Lindbloom say national support for the
arts is nearly as high in <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION> as in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, and more than
anywhere else in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>.
   Direct yearly support amounts to <MONEY>$400 million</MONEY>, and municipal
subsidies to local cutural establishment is about <MONEY>$937 million</MONEY>,
<PERSON>Lindbloom</PERSON> said.
   Together with indirect help, such as building new museums or
libraries, <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION> spends about <PERCENT>1.5 percent</PERCENT> of its gross national
product on the arts, he told the <ORGANIZATION>Associated Press</ORGANIZATION>.
   Although nothing has been trimmed from the national budget,
local authorities slash cultural projects first whenever they run
into trouble, complained <PERSON>Ingmar Bjorksten</PERSON>, the cultural affairs
correspondent for <ORGANIZATION>Svenska Dagbladet</ORGANIZATION>.
   Unemployment among artists is five times the national average of
just under <PERCENT>2 percent</PERCENT>, <PERSON>Bjorksten</PERSON> wrote.
   ``The only way for culture to get more money is to make a
fuss,'' said <PERSON>Svante Weyner</PERSON>, head of <LOCATION>Radio Sweden</LOCATION>'s cultural
division. Last year the radio cut the budget for a popular program
of radio plays. The budget was restored only after <PERSON>Ingmar Bergman</PERSON>
intervened.

<TEXT>
   Seventy seems to be the age these days when famous directors at last feel free enough in spirit to present themselves naked to the world, showing all their warts in tight close-up. 

   Earlier this <DATE>summer</DATE> we had <PERSON>Elia Kazan</PERSON> baring his soul in some 700 pages; now it is the turn of <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Ingmar Bergman</PERSON>, who in "The Magic Lantern" (Viking, <MONEY>$19.95</MONEY>) manages in a scant 308 pages to document abundantly just how monstrous a monstre sacre he is. 
Like <PERSON>Mr. Kazan</PERSON>, the little <PERSON>Ingmar</PERSON> was an unhappy child who grew into a veritable adolescent nerd. 
He adored his mother, but she often sent him away with "cool ironic words," leaving him weeping with rage and disappointment. 
He discovered that illness immediately attracted her attention, and embarked on a lifetime of stomach disorders and nearly unremitting nervous maladies. 
The onset of the production of every new film or play always sent him off to a clinic for a few weeks. 

   Life with mother proved singularly trying for Ingmar. 
When he was 55, his mother phoned him at his theater to tell him that his father was in the hospital, about to be operated on for a malignant tumor. 
"She wanted me to go see him." 
Ingmar explained that he had neither the time nor the desire to do so, that his father was a person to whom he was indifferent, and that his presence could only frighten and embarrass his father on what was sure to be his deathbed. 
"Mother was angry." 
She persisted. 
"I was upset and refused to be emotionally blackmailed. 
This eternal blackmail." 
His mother began crying; Ingmar hung up on her. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Bergman</PERSON>'s relations with his many wives, many more children, siblings and women friends are described briefly and chillingly. 
He does record that his then-19-year-old son, <PERSON>Ingmar Jr.</PERSON>, after the death of his mother in an automobile accident, looked at him "with a cold contempt that silenced me." 
<PERSON>Harriet Anderson</PERSON>, star of so many <PERSON>Bergman</PERSON> films, (and the cause of the breakup with <PERSON>Ingmar Jr.</PERSON>'s mother during the making of "Summer With Monika") is about the only person to receive kind or generous words in the book. 
For a really icy chill, consider <PERSON>Mr. Bergman</PERSON>'s description of <PERSON>Greta Garbo</PERSON> past her prime: "Her mouth was ugly, a pale slit surrounded by transverse wrinkles. 
It was strange and disturbing. 
All that beauty and in the middle of the beauty a shrill discord. 
No plastic surgeon or makeup man could conjure away that mouth and what it told me." 

   The man is cruel. 

   Reading this autobiography may prove an unnerving experience to those for whom "Wild Strawberries," "Smiles of a Summer Night" and "The Seventh Seal" affectionately are seminal film memories of youth. 
<PERSON>Mr. Bergman</PERSON> shows us their creator as a man eaten alive by his demons: cold, selfish, petty, mean. 
<PERSON>Mr. Bergman</PERSON> does tell us he knew he had persuasive powers, "that I could make people do what I wanted them to do, that I had some kind of surface charm which I could switch on and off at will." 

   Indeed, in reading these memoirs I had to remind myself constantly that when I spent many hours in his company about 20 years ago, I found him one of the most charming individuals I had ever met. 
At the time, <PERSON>Mr. Bergman</PERSON> said that he could not bear dealing with his own male peers. 
Only men much younger or much older were acceptable to him. 
If he discovered they were disadvantaged in some way, say, by being homosexual or Jewish, this discovery seemed to relax him socially. 
So too with women he appeared to enjoy this edge of advantage. 
Women also fascinated him almost as a species. 
He would become utterly absorbed getting to know a woman. 
His interest and curiosity had no bounds. 
Perhaps at 70, however, <PERSON>Mr. Bergman</PERSON> feels the need to charm is over. 
There is certainly no charm at all in this book. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Bergman</PERSON> seems to be saying: Here I am, a thoroughly hateful individual. 
Take me as I am -- if you can. 
He lays out evidence in abundance, even to telling how at age 15 in <LOCATION>Weimar</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>, he took part in a Nazi rally. 
"I shouted like everyone else, held out my arm like everyone else, howled like everyone else and loved it like everyone else." 
The speaker at the rally was <PERSON>Adolf Hitler</PERSON>. 
"I loved {<PERSON>Hitler</PERSON>}," says <PERSON>Mr. Bergman</PERSON>. 
"For many years, I was on Hitler's side, delighted by his successes and saddened by his defeats." 
His brother was one of the founders and organizers of the <ORGANIZATION>Swedish National-Socialist Party</ORGANIZATION>, and several times his father voted for the party's candidates. 
It was only well after the war that the now-adult <PERSON>Bergman</PERSON> finally accepted that the concentration camps were not "prearranged propaganda lies." 

   Still, at 70, <PERSON>Mr. Bergman</PERSON> faces into the dark night, "neither able nor willing to imagine another life, some kind of life beyond the frontier -- the perspective is appalling." 
He ends his autobiography with an entry purportedly from his mother's diary, a few days after his birth. 
"I pray to God with no confidence. 
One will probably have to manage alone as best one can."

Dreaming is emblematic of <PERSON>Ingmar Bergman</PERSON>'s "Wild Strawberries." This masterful 
Swedish director at first submerges us in his old hero's nightmare, and later, 
the film finds its own dimension where reality is often enveloped by fantasy. 
</P>
<P>
The first scenes set the tone and course for this <DATE>1957</DATE> movie, screening tonight 
at <ORGANIZATION>UC Irvine</ORGANIZATION>. Hallucinatory is one way to describe the beginning, as we're 
introduced to <PERSON>Isak Borg</PERSON> (<PERSON>Victor Sjostrom</PERSON>), a 78-year-old doctor known for his 
toughness. He's lying in bed, having a dream that eventually becomes a 
nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
In it, <PERSON>Isak</PERSON> is wandering down a street. Everything seems calm, but then <PERSON>Bergman</PERSON> 
lays out a series of metaphors -- timepieces without hands; a rushing, 
out-of-control hearse drawn by black horses; a pervading isolation that comes 
from the deserted town square. 
</P>
<P>
When the hearse crashes, a coffin falls out. The corpse, suddenly alive, 
reaches out to <PERSON>Isak</PERSON>, who sees that it's he who is dead. He wakes up with 
thoughts of his mortality and decides to drive instead of fly to a distant 
university where he will be given an honorary degree. 
</P>
<P>
Isak takes along his lovely daughter-in-law (<ORGANIZATION>Ingrid Thulin</ORGANIZATION>) and picks up three 
young hitchhikers (<PERSON>Bibi Andersson</PERSON>, <PERSON>Bjorn Bjelvenstam</PERSON> and <PERSON>Folke Sundquist</PERSON>) after 
they stop at his boyhood home. All three, especially the girl among them, are 
spirited, and their presence revitalizes Isak. 
</P>
<P>
Isak and his companions are now traveling in the real world, but Isak can't 
escape the earlier dream. The foreshadowing becomes overshadowing as <PERSON>Bergman</PERSON> 
thrusts Isak into several dreamlike reveries, juxtaposing the present with his 
uneasy past. The trip becomes an odyssey of self-revelation, regret and 
grudging acceptance. 
</P>
<P>
Like "The Seventh Seal," which was released a year before, "Wild Strawberries" 
initially baffled many critics, who found the symbolism too personal and 
arcane. It did poorly in limited release in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> but soon became a favorite 
of the art houses. <PERSON>Bergman</PERSON>'s early films, like those of Fellini, were the first 
international cult movies. 
</P>
<P>
The critics' complaints seem odd now. <PERSON>Bergman</PERSON>'s vision is unique, but there's a 
universal sweep to <PERSON>Isak</PERSON>'s self-absorption and the way the director describes it 
that speaks to everyone who has considered the path of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
This is, to be sure, a film of great melancholy and introspection without a 
happy or heroic resolution. At times, all the pondering freezes the action, 
requiring our patience and attention. "Wild Strawberries," a true classic, is 
as far away from an easy Hollywood movie as you can get. 
</P>
<P>
It has much to offer, from <PERSON>Bergman</PERSON>'s exploration of the narrative form to the 
script's reliance on the subconscious for inspiration. On a scholarly level, 
the film displays <PERSON>Bergman</PERSON>'s career-long preoccupations with death, spiritual 
truth and rejuvenation. They've become his signatures. 
</P>
<P>
 <PERSON>Ingmar Bergman</PERSON>'s "Wild Strawberries" will be screened tonight at 7 and 9 at <ORGANIZATION>UC 
Irvine's Student Center Crystal Cove Auditorium</ORGANIZATION> as part of the <ORGANIZATION>UCI</ORGANIZATION> Film Society 
Directors' Personal Portraits series. Tickets: <MONEY>$2</MONEY> to <MONEY>$4</MONEY>. (714) 856-6379.

THE BEST INTENTIONS (12) <LOCATION>Lumiere</LOCATION>, Gate Notting Hill
THE RAPTURE (18) MGMs West End
THE INNER CIRCLE (15) Odeon Haymarket
CASABLANCA (U) Empire
It is <LOCATION>Cannes</LOCATION> Film festival delivery fortnight. A week after the film that by
wide consent should have won the <DATE>1992</DATE> Golden Palm, <PERSON>Robert Altman</PERSON>'s The
Player, we welcome to <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> the film that did win the <ORGANIZATION>Golden Palm</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Bille</LOCATION>
<DATE>August</DATE>'s The Best Intentions.
In the auteurist shorthand used and abused today, we say '<PERSON>Altman</PERSON>'s' and
'<DATE>August</DATE>'s' films. But The Player owed much of its crackle to <PERSON>Michael
Tolkin</PERSON>'s script from his own novel. (For more about <PERSON>Mr</PERSON> T read on in this
column.) And The Best Intentions boasts a script by <PERSON>Ingmar Bergman</PERSON> based on
the lives of his own parents. Who is to call it an <DATE>August</DATE> film rather than a
<PERSON>Bergman</PERSON> film?
It is certainly a long film. Three hours, and even that a digest of the
six-hour serial version simultaneously prepared for TV. If pressed against a
wall by a man with a gun, I would say that in some respects The Best
Intentions is not a film at all: more a roman fleuve in pictures about the
love between a rich girl with a possessive family, played by <PERSON>Pernilla August</PERSON>
 -the director's wife, who won the <LOCATION>Cannes</LOCATION> best actress prize - and a young
pastor with a blond moustache and a live-in guilt complex (<PERSON>Samuel Frohler</PERSON>).
Yet 20 minutes into this story, we scarcely care what aesthetic category we
put it into. Film or mini-series, family album or novel-with-pictures, it
surges majestically through the century's early years as <PERSON>Bergman</PERSON> recreates
the bitter-sweet romance of his mother <PERSON>Anna</PERSON> and father <PERSON>Henrik</PERSON>. Henrik is a
cold-eyed Lutheran priest, <PERSON>Anna</PERSON> a walking nervous breakdown. Between them,
in snowscapes and lakelands that dazzle the eye, they create the conditions
of elegiac dementia in which young Ingmar could be born.
This is a prequel to <ORGANIZATION>Fanny And Alexander</ORGANIZATION>. Some of the same gusty relatives
tack and billow across the screen, as turbulent variations are played on the
theme of family life. Anna's folk are wealth-encrusted Swedish bourgeoisie,
from raspy old Papa (<PERSON>Max Von Sydow</PERSON>) who watches the distant trains from his
mound of rugs by the window, to melting-eyed Mama, a pudgy former beauty who
hides reserves of malice in the folds of her outward kindness. Meanwhile
<PERSON>Henrik</PERSON>'s <LOCATION>Mama</LOCATION> is a dotty old peasant woman living in the wilds and his
departed father has been replaced by an invisible, implacable,
incomprehensible God.
The defects of the parents are visited on the children and children's
children. As <PERSON>Henrik</PERSON> and <PERSON>Anna</PERSON> quarrel in their snowbound parish, which looks
as if it is a sermon's throw from the <LOCATION>North Pole</LOCATION>, their little son (<ORGANIZATION>Ingmar</ORGANIZATION>'s
older brother) is nearly murdered by the surly ragamuffin they adopt out of
Christian kindness. He is a cousin to all those haunted, stark-eyed urchins
who have prowled through <PERSON>Bergman</PERSON>'s films from The Seventh Seal to The
Silence.
Wonderfully elliptical even at its sprawling length, the film never
'explains' unhappiness or inhumanity. It merely exposes it vividly,
impassively, surgically on the snow-white sheet of the story's scenic
operating table.
Bergman the writer has lost none of his skill at paring emotion to the bone
and then beyond to the marrow. Quarrel scenes have a lacerating force;
reconciliations a melting poignancy; silences a terrifying ambiguity. If The
Best Intentions is less than the best of <PERSON>Bergman</PERSON> as a film - less than Hour
Of <ORGANIZATION>The Wolf</ORGANIZATION> or Persona or Fanny And <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> - it is because <DATE>August</DATE> is more
skilled at shaping performances than shaping screen pictures. Bergman would
have let the madness of human hope and despair spill out into the lighting
and camerawork. August merely records that madness in the performances, but
the performances at best, especially from <PERSON>Mrs August</PERSON>, are richness enough.
If God is a supporting villain in The Best Intentions, he is the
arch-villain in <PERSON>Michael Tolkin</PERSON>'s The Rapture. The writer of <ORGANIZATION>The Player</ORGANIZATION> wrote
and directed this electrifying fable about the evils of Christian
fundamentalism. Made on a mini-budget, it is part satire, part melodrama,
part visionary B-movie. One can imagine the moguls licking their lips. 'She
was only a switchboard operator,' the advertising copyline might run, 'but
she found a hot line to Heaven.'
The film's crazed primitivism is its strength. <PERSON>Mimi Rogers</PERSON>, who is fast
turning into today's <PERSON>Barbara Stanwyck</PERSON>, plays the telephone employee who
gives up her life as a daytime drudge and night-time debauchee - attending
swinger orgies with her suavely greying boyfriend <PERSON>Patrick Bauchau</PERSON> - when God
calls her 'collect'.
Will she pay for the call? Yes indeed. A bright light, a vision, a death;
then the poignant pleadings of her little daughter. Soon Miss R is out in
the desert waiting for God to snatch up her and the little one in a
pre-Judgment Day 'rapture.' But God moves in mysterious ways, especially
when He is the God of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s born-again fundamentalists. Even when
<PERSON>Gabriel</PERSON>'s horn sounds in the film's astonishing finale, mystical
triumphalism is nowhere in sight. And the horsemen of the apocalypse pound
unfeeling through the mires of human grief and disenchantment.
If I spell out more of the plot, your own astonishment will be ruined. The
Rapture has a few first-time film-maker's faults: the over-urgent piling on
of saleable ingredients (sex, drugs, sudden death), too many
plonk-the-camera-down dialogue scenes. But it also has a first-time
film-maker's miraculous innocence. Scenes that a veteran would claim you
'could not do' are carried off here with a sublime insouciance.
The message of the film is that miracles do not happen: or not the useful,
daily miracles we pray for as distinct from the global magic act we all
await on Judgment Day. But this film is a miracle of its kind: a story that
pierces the veil between here and the beyond with a rough magic far more
powerful than the whimsical mysticism we have grown used to with Ghost and
company.
The Inner Circle is set in a city where everyone speaks English with a
strenuous Russian accent. It is <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> in the <DATE>1940s</DATE>, where according to
writer-director <PERSON>Andrei Konchalovsky</PERSON> (<ORGANIZATION>Maria</ORGANIZATION>'s Lovers, <ORGANIZATION>Runaway Train</ORGANIZATION>) a young
man in the likeness of <PERSON>Tom Hulce</PERSON> served as film projectionist to a man with
a walrus moustache and Oriental eye make-up called <PERSON>Joseph Stalin</PERSON> (<PERSON>Alexandre
Zbruev</PERSON>).
While our hero falls under the tyrant's evil spell, his wife (<ORGANIZATION>Lolita
Davidovich</ORGANIZATION>) busies herself swinging between liberal goodheartedness - she
pays forbidden visits to a sickly-sentimental Jewish orphan (<PERSON>Bess Meyer</PERSON>) -
and cynical despair. In the latter mode, she lends her body to <PERSON>Bob Hoskins</PERSON>,
alias <ORGANIZATION>KGB</ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON>Beria</PERSON>. They make love in his private train compartment as
the rolling-stock of history rattles towards <ORGANIZATION>Stalin</ORGANIZATION>'s final days.
The first film ever shot in the corridors of the <ORGANIZATION>KGB</ORGANIZATION>, let alone <PERSON>Beria</PERSON>'s
train compartment, The Inner Circle is also the umpteenth film to turn
truth-based political tragedy into dial-a-cliche melodrama. Overacted by
almost everyone in sight and scripted for stark risibility - 'F---off' says
<PERSON>Stalin</PERSON> to a VIP petitioner early on and the dialogue does not improve - it
comes to life only when raiding history direct. The climactic scenes of
people literally trampled to death in the crowds jostling towards <ORGANIZATION>Uncle
Joe</ORGANIZATION>'s coffin shows the grim punishment that awaits a nation that misjudges
its leader during his life and turns misjudgment into deification after his
death.
Casablanca is 50 years old and has also undergone deification. But no
misjudgment here: the film is still a classic. Re-opening in a new 35-mm
print, it reanimates <LOCATION>Bogart</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Bergman</PERSON> and company and sets them dancing
through <PERSON>Rick</PERSON>'s Cafe Americain as the dialogue crackles, the romance revs and
<PERSON>Dooley Wilson</PERSON> at the piano keeps telling us we must remember this. Who on
earth could forget?

<TEXT>
   In her native country, <PERSON>Greta Garbo</PERSON> was
remembered with pride today as an actress whose charisma made her
``the world's best known Swedish emigrant.''
   ``I do not know what it was that made everybody turn around and
keep looking at her when we entered a restaurant,'' <PERSON>Garbo</PERSON>'s
longtime friend <PERSON>Mimi Pollack</PERSON> said on Swedish national radio.
   <PERSON>Ms. Pollack</PERSON> and <PERSON>Garbo</PERSON> were fellow students at <LOCATION>Stockholm</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Royal
Theater School</ORGANIZATION> in the early <DATE>1920s</DATE>. <PERSON>Ms. Pollack</PERSON> said they had not
been in touch since <PERSON>Garbo</PERSON> fell ill this <DATE>winter</DATE>.
   Swedish film professor <PERSON>Leif Furhammar</PERSON> said he remembered her as
a someone ``who walks down the stairs in such a way that you cannot
take your eyes off her.''
   <PERSON>Torsten Jungstedt</PERSON>, a Swedish film critic, told the Swedish
national news agency TT that <PERSON>Garbo</PERSON>'s ``face was perfect for film.
It was a close shot face with an enormous amount of life in it.''
   ``Photographers said it had a light of its own,'' he said.
   <PERSON>Garbo</PERSON> died <DATE>Sunday</DATE> in a <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> hospital. She was 84.
   She grew up in <LOCATION>Soder</LOCATION>, a workers' district in southern <LOCATION>Stockholm</LOCATION>.
Director <PERSON>Mauritz Stiller</PERSON> discovered her at the <ORGANIZATION>Royal Theater
School</ORGANIZATION>. Stiller and <PERSON>Pollack</PERSON> persuaded her to change her name from
<PERSON>Greta Gustafsson</PERSON> to <PERSON>Greta Garbo</PERSON>.
   <PERSON>Garbo</PERSON> was the first of several Swedes who made international
film careers, including director <PERSON>Ingmar Bergman</PERSON>, and actors <PERSON>Ingrid
Bergman</PERSON>, <PERSON>Max von Sydow</PERSON>, <PERSON>Bibi Andersson</PERSON>, <PERSON>Anita Ekberg</PERSON>, and most
recently <PERSON>Lena Olin</PERSON>.
   Stiller had gone with <PERSON>Garbo</PERSON> to <ORGANIZATION>Hollywood</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1925</DATE> and tried to
bring her back to <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION> when he returned two years later. But she
stayed on and later became an American citizen, returning to <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION>
to visit only occasionally.

Huston</PERSON>, has died of heart failure. He was 85.
   <PERSON>Kohner</PERSON> died <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> at <ORGANIZATION>University of California</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>,
Medical Center, said <PERSON>John Strauss</PERSON>, a longtime associate. His wife,

   The blond giant stood tentatively on the stage
of the Place des Artes theater, seemingly amazed at the standing
ovation accorded him by the packed audience.
   <PERSON>Max Von Sydow</PERSON> had come to the <LOCATION>Montreal</LOCATION> World Film Festival for a
tribute to his 30-year career that has brought distinction to
movies on both sides of the <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION>. The program included clips
from two widely divergent films: <PERSON>Ingmar Bergman</PERSON>'s ``The Virgin
Spring'' (<DATE>1959</DATE>) and ``Hannah and Her Sisters'' (<DATE>1986</DATE>).
   A dialogue with the actor was followed by a screening of the
Danish-made ``Pelle the Conqueror,'' which drew the <ORGANIZATION>Motion Picture
Academy</ORGANIZATION>'s best foreign-language film Oscar of <DATE>1988</DATE> as well as a
nomination as best actor for <ORGANIZATION>Von Sydow</ORGANIZATION>. He received a second
standing ovation when he left the stage.
   ``It's very strange,'' he admitted afterward. ``I don't know how
you feel, but I feel like I'm 25 inside. I don't feel that I have
any kind of `lifetime achievement.'''
   Film critics would argue with that. If he had appeared only in
the <PERSON>Bergman</PERSON> films, <PERSON>Von Sydow</PERSON> would have earned a place in movie
history. But he also has contributed a series of noteworthy
performances in a wide variety of films, from the profound (<ORGANIZATION>Jesus
Christ</ORGANIZATION> in ``The Greatest Story Ever Told'') to the eerie (``The
Exorcist'') to the frivolous (Ming the Merciless in ``Flash
Gordon'').
   Like most successful actors, <PERSON>Von Sydow</PERSON>'s career was the result
of a series of happy accidents. He was born 60 years ago in <LOCATION>Lund</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION>, the son of a university professor and his wife. Max
happened to see some plays in nearby <LOCATION>Malmo</LOCATION>, prompting him to enroll
in dramatic classes at high school. After his two-year military
service, he enrolled in the <ORGANIZATION>Royal Academy</ORGANIZATION>, training ground for such
famous Swedes as <PERSON>Greta Garbo</PERSON> and <PERSON>Ingrid Bergman</PERSON>.
   <PERSON>Von Sydow</PERSON> played repertory at the <ORGANIZATION>Malmo Municipal Theater</ORGANIZATION>, where
<PERSON>Bergman</PERSON> had been hired as chief director. When <PERSON>Bergman</PERSON> filmed ``The
Seventh Seal,'' he chose the young actor as a returning Crusader.
The pair collaborated on 11 films.
   <PERSON>George Stevens</PERSON> was impressed with <PERSON>Von Sydow</PERSON>'s strong, mystical
persona and cast him in the mammoth, unrealized ``The Greatest
Story Ever Told.'' ``<LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>'' with <PERSON>Julie Andrews</PERSON> was also a
disappointment, but the two films established <PERSON>Von Sydow</PERSON> as an
international star. He has been working all over the world ever
since.
   Before leaving <LOCATION>Montreal</LOCATION> for a new film in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Von Sydow</PERSON>
paused for an interview with <ORGANIZATION>The Associated Press</ORGANIZATION>:
   Q. You have now directed your first film, ``Katinka.'' How did
you like being on the other side of the camera?
   A. ``It was a great experience, very exciting. I had never had
any plans to become a director, but this was something very
special. It dealt with a novel I had found a long time ago; I fell
in love with it immediately and saw it as a film with me playing a
part in it.
   ``I tried to convince my director friends, but nobody caught on
to it. Then someone approached me to direct the film, and I
couldn't turn it down. I was too old to play one of the parts,
unfortunately. Time does these things to you. It was a great
experience, exhausting, but I learned a lot.''
   Q. At the tribute you mentioned that the first 20 years as an
actor were a kind of therapy for you. What did you mean?
   A. ``I have a feeling that many actors choose acting because
there's something they long for but cannot reach, that there's
something they cannot express in their private lives, that there's
a threshold they cannot pass.
   ``I was a very shy boy when I was a kid. I had difficulty to
communicate with people I didn't know. When I started acting in an
amateur group in high school, although I wasn't aware of it at the
time, I suddenly got a tool in my hand that was wonderful. I was
allowed to express all kinds of strange things that I never dared
to express before. Now I could do it with the character as a
shield, as a defense, and as an excuse.
   ``I think that for many years I used my profession as some kind
of a mental therapy. I worked all the time, and I needed it. I was
restless, and I was very crazy if I was not allowed to work.
Through the years I have backed off. Life has helped me, and my
friends and my wife and my family. Today I don't need that therapy
anymore.''
   Q. The acting life has sent you all over the world. Did you
expect that when you started out?
   A. ``No, that happened later. It has its advantages and its
drawbacks. But that can be very exciting. I'm grateful because I've
seen so much of the world that I wouldn't have seen otherwise. But
sometimes you get a little too much of hotel rooms and suitcases
and packing and unpacking. I think I'll try to take it a little
easier in the future.
   ``I'm planning to do more theater, at least one production a
year, limited engagement.''
   Q. Where is home nowadays?
   A. ``My home is in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>. Funny thing is that I haven't spent
much time there because I've been working elsewhere. We have an
apartment which I like very much. It's a wonderful old palace in
the old quarter of <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>. It's where Beaumarchais wrote `The
Marriage of Figaro.' It has been remodeled, and we have the attic
of the house.
   ``We also have a <DATE>summer</DATE> place in <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION>, and <DATE>summer</DATE> in <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION> is
very important. I guess I am more of a country boy than a city boy,
even though I grew up in a small town.''
   Q. Your world travels have caused separations from your family,
right?
   A. ``Not always, but for long periods. My wife comes along when
I go to places she thinks she will enjoy. It's not easy. But I have
a good wife, and we like each other very much. We have managed to
stay together.''

<HEAD>Ingmar Bergman's Production of `Hamlet' Travels to Brooklyn</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: No PMs planned.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Drama Critic</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nothing is quite what it should be in the world
created by director <PERSON>Ingmar Bergman</PERSON> for his startling, violent and
often mesmerizing production of ``Hamlet'' which arrived this week
at the <ORGANIZATION>Brooklyn Academy of Music</ORGANIZATION> for an eight-performance run.
   In <PERSON>Bergman</PERSON>'s unnerving creation for the Royal Dramatic Theater
of <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Denmark</LOCATION> becomes an environment of decay, sexual excess,
psychotic behavior and ultimately needless slaughter carried out to
ear-bursting pop music and the whir of minicams and tape recorders.
   Elsinore has been transformed into a castle of lost souls where
a drunken king and queen have sex in public while the court titters
and applauds, Polonius preaches like a stuffy British barrister,
<ORGANIZATION>Ophelia</ORGANIZATION> becomes a disheveled flower child gone mad, the Gravedigger
turns into an existential comic waiting for Godot and Fortinbras
storms the stage as a black-bereted guerrilla leader.
   At the center of <PERSON>Bergman</PERSON>'s chaos stands a tall, dark, brooding
Hamlet who would not look out of place in one of <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>'s tonier
rock clubs. Dressed entirely in black and wearing sunglasses, the
actor slouches on stage. As played by a fascinating and forceful
actor named <PERSON>Peter Stormare</PERSON>, this Hamlet arrives with a <PERSON>Marlon
Brando</PERSON> swagger and a <PERSON>Norman Bates</PERSON> psychosis.
   Stormare, an intense, hawk-like presence, brings a wild energy
to the 3{-hour production. The actor is not an introspective Hamlet
calmly reasoning out what should be done. This prince rails against
the world and what has happened to the kingdom since his uncle
murdered his father and married his mother.
   When this Hamlet acts, he gets carried away. When he kills
Polonius, he stabs him in the eye and then scrawls the word `blood'
on the wall. When he tells <ORGANIZATION>Ophelia</ORGANIZATION> to ``get thee to a nunnery,'' he
nearly rapes her in the process.
   There is one radical change in the text, involving the transfer
of one famous speech from one scene to another. When Hamlet is
talking quietly to the player king about how to act out his
father's death, the young prince, overcome with grief, suddenly
breaks down and delivers ``To be or not to be?'' It's an
interesting concept, particularly since the actor portraying the
player king, <ORGANIZATION>Per Myrberg</ORGANIZATION>, also plays the ghost of Hamlet's father.
   Bergman's production contains some startling imagery, much of it
designed by <PERSON>Goran Wassberg</PERSON>. His setting is simple _ a bare, black
stage, an arc of lights hanging above it and a circle, outlined in
red, placed on the floor at center stage.
   Wassberg's costumes are equally eye-catching, many of them in
shades of red and from different periods of fashion. The contrast
between the old and new underlines the uncertainty that plagues
this royal court.
   <PERSON>Pernilla Ostergren</PERSON> is a touching <ORGANIZATION>Ophelia</ORGANIZATION>, a child-woman who
remains on stage for much of evening, a forlorn witness to most of
the debauchery. <PERSON>Borje Ahlstedt</PERSON> is a randy, boozy Claudius while
<PERSON>Gunnel Lindblom</PERSON> as <PERSON>Gertrude</PERSON> matches him in every debauchery. Rarely
have these two royal misfits been so ably put on stage.
   The production is performed in Swedish, and the language
difference eventually poses a problem. For audiences familiar with
the English text, <PERSON>Bergman</PERSON>'s interpretation of the story should be
readily accessible. But others with no knowledge of the play will
be lost. What's also missing from the production, at least for an
English-speaking audience, is the readily recognizable poetry.
   Still, there are <PERSON>Bergman</PERSON>'s startling images of a world gone out
of control. The foreign language may cloud the text, but the
director's particular point of view shines through with a clarity
that makes this ``Hamlet'' a compelling and often haunting evening
of theater.

FT  19 NOV 92 / Arts: Ibsen and Bergman - a marriage made in heaven / The
first European theatre festival in Dusseldorf is proving a heady experience
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
President <PERSON>Mitterrand</PERSON> paid for it, <PERSON>Giorgio Strehler</PERSON> opened it, and <PERSON>Ingmar
Bergman</PERSON> was the catch of week one. At the first European Theatre Festival
launched last week in <LOCATION>Dusseldorf</LOCATION>, radical chic has never been more
sparkling. Bergman and <ORGANIZATION>Ibsen</ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON>Strehler</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Goldoni</LOCATION>; <PERSON>Brecht</PERSON> directed by his
son in law; a revolutionary Catalan Figaro; from <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> the <ORGANIZATION>RNT</ORGANIZATION>'s Angels in
<LOCATION>America</LOCATION>: stars stud the stage, tickets are gold dust, visitors fill smoky
bars for midnight post-mortems. The mood recalls <LOCATION>Edinburgh</LOCATION>, the variety
<LOCATION>Vienna</LOCATION> and the quality <LOCATION>Salzburg</LOCATION>: on the first few days' tasting this new
festival, whose venue will change each year, looks set to become <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>'s
most heady and prestigious theatre binge.
Bergman doing <ORGANIZATION>Ibsen</ORGANIZATION> is a marriage made in heaven, and the <ORGANIZATION>Royal Theatre
Stockholm's Peer Gynt</ORGANIZATION> offers a rare chance to see film-maker as stage
director. <ORGANIZATION>Peer Gynt</ORGANIZATION>, its series of frozen scenes in Peer's life unravelled
like magic boxes, is a natural vehicle for cinematic theatricality; in to it
<PERSON>Bergman</PERSON>, always an autobiographical artist, injects a personal vision which
transforms this often wooden piece into an emotional coup de force. A
century on, <PERSON>Bergman</PERSON>'s art is rooted in scenes close to Ibsen: moral
integrity; a sense of sin powerfully visualised; individual expression
within claustrophobic relationships; the meeting of dream and reality.
<PERSON>Bergman</PERSON>'s set is a sinister red room, centre stage, enclosed within the
larger frame of Peer's home. High, thick wooden walls carved with flowers,
dim gaslights, a grandfather clock, a sturdy crib, hem it in on three sides.
Actions, memories, are compressed into this chamber of the imagination; like
dreams, each seen has its own visual logic. The wedding guests, in flame-red
folk-dress buttoned up to neck and wrists, weighed down with gold brocade
and buckles, hijack the room for a hellish, anti-erotic tap dance full of
jerkily suppressed lunges for freedom. The trolls, green tarts in flounces,
frills and dreadlocks, drag Peer on a rhino to an orgy in a madhouse. They
hang over the roof of the room swinging erect green tails and snorting
lewdly. Sex screams out, Peer hurtles about trying to conceal a huge rubber
penis emerging between his legs.
Later, laser beams focus on top-hatted men in black encircling Peer; their
accusations echo as distortions from loudspeakers across a vast auditorium
and against a chorus of church bells: a choking vision of guilt.
Loneliness, repression and sin are the motifs. Solveig's family, Amish-style
puritans, march in line like geese, fall to their knees chant prayers, a
young child spies on <ORGANIZATION>Peer</ORGANIZATION> from a doorway. Based on <PERSON>Bergman</PERSON>'s own upbringing,
they are as chilling an emblem of cruel rectitude as the father in his film
Fanny and <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON>. <PERSON>Lena Andre</PERSON>'s <PERSON>Solveig</PERSON>, symbol of love, unwinds with
conviction and subtlety from torment into a mix of nervousness/grace,
fear/determination.
As Peer, <PERSON>Borje Andersson</PERSON> is Everyman: chubby, dazed, endlessly flexible
face; round, hapless body; a dreamer whose desires are now pathetic, now
comic, now horrifying. He sticks out his tongue at us, drops his trousers at
the whiff of a woman; he is also the desperate loner; seeking warmth,
meaning, justification. A magnificent, inexhaustible performance.
The European Theatre Festival to <DATE>November 27</DATE> at the <LOCATION>Dusseldorf</LOCATION>,

<TEXT>
   Swedish screen star <PERSON>Max Von Sydow</PERSON>, whose new film
``Pelle the Conqueror'' won the grand prize at the <ORGANIZATION>Cannes Film
Festival</ORGANIZATION>, is turning to the English stage in a career move he
described as ``a great surprise.''
   ``It's very exciting,'' the tall, lanky <PERSON>Von Sydow</PERSON> said of his
upcoming role as Prospero in <ORGANIZATION>Shakespeare</ORGANIZATION>'s ``The Tempest.'' The
play opens <DATE>Oct. 6</DATE> at <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>'s Old Vic theater for a limited run
through <DATE>Nov. 26</DATE>.
   The production, directed by <PERSON>Jonathan Miller</PERSON>, will mark <PERSON>Von
Sydow</PERSON>'s first English-language appearance on the <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> stage. He
previously appeared in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> in <DATE>1974</DATE> in a Swedish staging of
<PERSON>Henrik Ibsen</PERSON>'s ``The Wild Duck.''
   That production was directed by <PERSON>Ingmar Bergman</PERSON>, with whom <PERSON>Von
Sydow</PERSON> has had a long and illustrious career on stage and in such
films as ``The Seventh Seal,'' ``Wild Strawberries,'' ``Through a
Glass Darkly'' and ``The Passion of <PERSON>Anna</PERSON>.''
   On Broadway, <PERSON>Von Sydow</PERSON> has starred in two flops: ``The Night of
the Tribades,'' with <PERSON>Eileen Atkins</PERSON> and <PERSON>Bibi Andersson</PERSON>, and ``Duet
for One,'' with <PERSON>Anne Bancroft</PERSON>.
   ``It's a very interesting idea,'' <PERSON>Von Sydow</PERSON>, 58, said of
director <PERSON>Miller</PERSON>'s choice that he play <PERSON>Prospero</PERSON>, a part more often
associated with English actors in their twilight years.
   <PERSON>Miller</PERSON>, in a separate interview, explained his casting.
   ``I wanted to break out of the noble aria approach English
performers often take to the part,'' said <PERSON>Miller</PERSON>, who is in his
first year as the artistic director of <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>'s venerable Old Vic.
   ``I've never seen Max on stage, but I know he is a great,
accomplished actor. I've seen all his films.''
   Prospero furthers what has been an unusually busy year for <ORGANIZATION>Von
Sydow</ORGANIZATION>. He is presently appearing at the <ORGANIZATION>National Theater of
Stockholm</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>August Strindberg</LOCATION>'s <DATE>1872</DATE> ``Master Olof.''
   In Bille <DATE>August</DATE>'s prize-winning Danish film, ``Pelle the
Conqueror,'' <PERSON>Von Sydow</PERSON> heads up a family of immigrant farmworkers
at the turn of the century, giving a performance for which he's won
critical praise. The film won La Palme D'Or, the top prize, at the
41st annual Cannes Film Festival which ended on <DATE>May 23</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Von Sydow</PERSON> was also represented at <LOCATION>Cannes</LOCATION> with his directorial
debut, ``<PERSON>Katinka</PERSON>,'' adapted from a novel by the Danish author
<PERSON>Herman Bang</PERSON> about a three-way love affair.
   He said he had originally hoped to act in a movie version of the
book when he first read the novel 25 years ago.
   Now, since he was too old for the male leads, he decided to
direct the movie instead: ``Coincidence put the possibility in my
hands.''
   Of his English-language films, <PERSON>Von Sydow</PERSON> said he looked back
fondly on ``Hannah and Her Sisters,'' <PERSON>Woody Allen</PERSON>'s <DATE>1986</DATE> movie in
which he played <PERSON>Barbara Hershey</PERSON>'s tortured, irascible companion.
   ``Most of the scripts one gets are so bad it was wonderful to
receive one with intelligent dialogue,'' said the actor, who felt
challenged by <PERSON>Allen</PERSON>'s requirements.
   ``He (<PERSON>Allen</PERSON>) demands <PERCENT>200 percent</PERCENT> of a naturalistic style. He
does not allow any literary phrasings or pronunciation,'' <PERSON>Von Sydow</PERSON>
said.
   This version of ``The Tempest'' will mark the fourth major
production of the play to be seen in <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> this year; both the
star and his director said they would not be seeing the others.
   ``It's very disturbing to be influenced,'' said <PERSON>Von Sydow</PERSON>, who
last played <ORGANIZATION>Shakespeare</ORGANIZATION>'s conjurer-poet in a Swedish production 35
years ago when, he said, he was ``much too young.''
   <PERSON>Miller</PERSON> said, ``I don't go very much to the theater. It's too
much of a busman's holiday.''

VON SYDOW'S SCENES OF DESTRUCTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
"This movie is not entertainment," <PERSON>Max Von Sydow</PERSON> says, casting his eye over the 
bloody costumes of dozens of Japanese people lying in a church courtyard. "It's 
much more of a political statement." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Von Sydow</PERSON>, who received a best actor Oscar nomination last year for "Pelle the 
Conqueror," is talking about <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION>'s "<LOCATION>Hiroshima</LOCATION>: Out of the Ashes," about the 
aftermath of the <LOCATION>Hiroshima</LOCATION> bombing. It airs at <TIME>9 p.m.</TIME> on <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, the 45th 
anniversary of the day the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> dropped the first atomic bomb, on 
<LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"The pacifist in me made me interested in this project," he says, explaining 
his decision to portray a German Catholic priest working in <LOCATION>Hiroshima</LOCATION> on <DATE>Aug</DATE>. 
6, <DATE>1945</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's good that we're sometimes reminded of important events in 
history. When Pope <PERSON>John Paul II</PERSON> visited <LOCATION>Hiroshima</LOCATION> recently, he says, 'We have 
to look to the past to learn for the future."' 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Von Sydow</PERSON>, who first came to worldwide notice 35 years ago through the films of 
fellow <PERSON>Swede Ingmar Bergman</PERSON>, explains he's not just talking about bombs. 
</P>
<P>
"<LOCATION>Hiroshima</LOCATION> has become a metaphor not just for nuclear war but for war and 
destruction and violence toward civilians," he says. "It's not just the idea we 
should not use nuclear arms. We should not start another war because it's 
madness." 
</P>
<P>
The scene <DATE>today</DATE> in <LOCATION>Valencia</LOCATION>, which is standing in for <LOCATION>Hiroshima</LOCATION>, occurs the day 
after the bomb fell. With two wind machines at work blowing smoke and dust in 
the actors' faces, the scene is eerily reminiscent of photographs taken of the 
destruction. 
</P>
<P>
Wearing a black cassock, <PERSON>Von Sydow</PERSON> busily attends the wounded. 
</P>
<P>
The bomb on <LOCATION>Hiroshima</LOCATION>, which flattened <PERCENT>90%</PERCENT> of the city, resulted in nearly 
130,000 casualties. A second bomb dropped on <LOCATION>Nagasaki</LOCATION> <DATE>three days later</DATE> prompted 
the Japanese to accept unconditional surrender, bringing an end to World War 
II. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike other movies that have examined <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s decision to bomb <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, the 
focus of "<LOCATION>Hiroshima</LOCATION>: Out of the Ashes" follows the survivors. In the ensemble 
film, <ORGANIZATION>Von Sydow</ORGANIZATION> shares billing with <PERSON>Judd Nelson</PERSON> (an <ORGANIZATION>American POW</ORGANIZATION> interned in a 
<LOCATION>Hiroshima</LOCATION> jail), <PERSON>Pat Morita</PERSON> (a <LOCATION>Hiroshima</LOCATION> postman), <PERSON>Tamlyn Tomito</PERSON> (a 
Japanese-American whose husband is in the Japanese Army) and <PERSON>Kim Miyori</PERSON> (a 
mother of a missing child). 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Von Sydow</PERSON> is reluctant to address the moral issues surrounding <LOCATION>Hiroshima</LOCATION>. "We 
don't know what would have happened if <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> hadn't dropped the bombs," he 
said. "It's easy to say that no bombs should have been dropped. But this was a 
war situation, and dropping them was an attempt to end the war." 
</P>
<P>
Although <PERSON>Von Sydow</PERSON>, 61, was too young to have fought in World War II, he did 
see its effects first-hand. In <DATE>1945</DATE> he was a high school student in <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION>, a 
country that remained neutral during the war. "That <DATE>spring</DATE>," he recalls, "the 
concentration camps were opened, and members of the <ORGANIZATION>Red Cross</ORGANIZATION> went in and 
brought a large number of prisoners to southern <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"I belonged to a folk dance group that visited these poor, miserable people and 
performed for them. We were asked to learn a number of national anthems, and we 
sang them. It was an extremely emotional experience. Many of these people were 
in terrible shape. They looked like walking skeletons, but they were beaming 
with joy as we entertained them." 
</P>
<P>
Encouraged by such a reception, <PERSON>Von Sydow</PERSON> ignored his parents' plan for him to 
enter college and instead pursued an acting career. "I was in such a hurry to 
be an actor," he remembers. "Now I'm sometimes mad at myself that I didn't stop 
and study for a couple of years." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he attended <LOCATION>Stockholm</LOCATION>'s Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts, began a stage 
career and then had the good fortune to meet <PERSON>Bergman</PERSON>. His work in the 
director's "The Seventh Seal," "The Magician" and "The Virgin Spring" brought 
him to the attention of Hollywood. In <DATE>1965</DATE>, <PERSON>Von Sydow</PERSON> came to <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> to play 
Christ in "The Greatest Story Ever Told," and he has come back periodically 
ever since. 
</P>
<P>
Apart from the title role in "The Exorcist" and a small part in "Hannah and Her 
Sisters," as <PERSON>Barbara Hershey</PERSON>'s intellectual lover, most of <PERSON>Von Sydow</PERSON>'s work in 
<LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> films has been villainous. "It's because I'm foreign," he explains in 
his ever-so-lightly accented English, Rand foreigners are very often villains." 
Since the success of "Pelle the Conqueror," an Oscar-winner in <DATE>1989</DATE> for best 
foreign film, <PERSON>Von Sydow</PERSON> thinks he has a new image in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>. "Now 
I'm getting less villain offers and more normal people offers," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Even as his Hollywood career prospers, <PERSON>Von Sydow</PERSON>, who has lived in <LOCATION>Rome</LOCATION> and 
<LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> for more than a decade, intends to move back to <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION> to pursue stage 
work. "If they want me, I'll do one limited theater engagement there every year 
and films the rest of the time," he says. "It's a daydream, but I hope it will 
work."

ONE FALSE MOVE (18)
<PERSON>Carl Franklin</PERSON>
LEAP OF FAITH (PG)
<PERSON>Richard Pearce</PERSON>
THE OX (12)
<PERSON>Sven Nykvist</PERSON>
BEST OF THE BEST 2 (18)
<PERSON>Robert Radler</PERSON>
<LOCATION>PARIS</LOCATION> IS BURNING
<PERSON>Jennie Livingston
Star</PERSON> <LOCATION>City</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION>, and <PERSON>Rustwater</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION>, are both small towns near the
middle of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>. But look closely - is there a big difference? Exactly.
One is in <PERSON>Jim Thompson</PERSON> country, the other is in <PERSON>Sinclair Lewis</PERSON> country.
Star City is the small town as rural spittoon. In the irresistibly grimy,
downbeat thriller One False Move - scripted by <PERSON>Billy Bob Thornton</PERSON> and <PERSON>Tom
Epperson</PERSON> but surely ghost-dictated by that master of elevated pulp <PERSON>J.
Thompson</PERSON> - the town plays host to fugitive gangsters, dimwitted lawmen and a
climactic carnage that Aeschylus would be proud of.
Up the road a little - go north and bend left - is Rust-water in wheatbelt
<LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION>. For displaced urban crime read agriculture under stress. There is a
drought here and the farms are dying; and if one pastoral crisis is not
enough, here comes another. Revivalist preacher <PERSON>Jonas Nightengale</PERSON> (<PERSON>Steve
Martin</PERSON>), comedy-cloned by screenwriter <PERSON>Janus Cercone</PERSON> from <PERSON>Sinclair Lewis</PERSON>'s
<PERSON>Elmer Gantry</PERSON>, passes through town with his all-singing, all-praying tent
show. He gives the rain-starved farmers hope; he raiseth the lame and sick
(the language is catching); he thumps his <LOCATION>Bible</LOCATION>; and he is a frightful,
pearly-teethed fraud made winning by the charismatic <PERSON>Mr Martin</PERSON>.
When films venture outside <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> they usually end up in <LOCATION>Cutesville</LOCATION>,
<ORGANIZATION>USA</ORGANIZATION>. See ET, Back To The Future and <ORGANIZATION>Co</ORGANIZATION>. To Hollywood any place without smog,
faxes and power breakfasts must seem strange and innocent. But One False
Move, by a mile the better of the week's rural twosome, makes a rich dark
joke of this (faux)-navete. At the centre: a young Southern sheriff (Bill
Paxton) intent on proving his mettle to two visiting lawmen (one white, one
black) from <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>. All the Angelenos want to do is to round up a pair
of cocaine-dealing killers (also one black, one white) who massacred a
roomful of people back in LA and then fled with their guns, their drugs and
their girl (<ORGANIZATION>Cynthia Williams</ORGANIZATION>). Will they come to ground in the girl's home
town of <LOCATION>Star City</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ark.</LOCATION>?
Not yet. First the movie, directed with sizzling grace by ex-actor <PERSON>Carl
Franklin</PERSON>, travels all over the south-western states as the getaway trio make
for <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION> (to sell their drugs) before being harried by police pursuit
into doubling back north for <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION>. Back here the film's other character
grouping has been in mocking parallel action. For two black/white crooks
with a brown-skinned girl read two black/white city cops with a redneck
sheriff.
The racial patch-quilting, though teasingly displayed, is never deployed for
facile tension. Indeed Southern values are almost respected for their loony
matter-of-factness. Paxton's pinbrained lawman is a creation so ridiculous
it is sublime. He boasts, he bumbles, he preens. And he obliviously throws
out the word 'nigger' while his black colleague pretends polite deafness.
Even the sheriff's wife shakes her head at his intellect, while
simultaneously advertising her own. ('He watches TV, I read non-fiction'.)
And when her man goes off to do what a man's gotta do, the film moves into a
High Noon climax re-staged - brilliantly - as nihilist farce.
One False Move is a rural tragicomedy with the deadly grace of a sidewinder.
Leap Of Faith is more like a stoned python. It folds itself round its
subject's neck, makes some promising hissing noises - and then falls asleep
on the job. We love the sight of <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> dancing into town with his big-band
show of dubious miracles: orchestrated by <ORGANIZATION>Debra Winger</ORGANIZATION> at the backstage
computer, feeding audience information into <ORGANIZATION>Martin</ORGANIZATION>'s on-stage earpiece. 'Man
in white shirt, hard of hearing', 'Woman in pink with arthritis'. Then the
slapping-on of hands, the customer's fainting fall, the lordy-lordy
paroxysms of ersatz joy.
Unfortunately, something else in the movie soon reveals itself as ersatz. It
is the subplot. Make that two subplots: for while Winger romances the
improbably saintly town sheriff <PERSON>Liam Neeson</PERSON> - so handsome, so gentle, so
liberal (no redneckery in this burg) - <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> makes a play for diner
waitress <ORGANIZATION>Lolita Davidovitch</ORGANIZATION>. She has a crippled, chess-playing little
brother (<PERSON>Lukas Haas</PERSON> of Witness) who will surely, if <PERSON>Cliff Eidelman</PERSON>'s music
has not done the job by then, end by melting his and our hearts.
Can a real miracle happen? Yes indeed. For lo, the cinema exit doors finally
open before we have all passed out with terminal queasiness. Director
<PERSON>Richard Pearce</PERSON> (Heartland, No Mercy) delivers the razzle-dazzle in the
revivalist set pieces, with <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> exploding all over stage. But no
star-director team can keep their anti-twaddle guns firing in the face of
both the appointed target - high-sleaze evangelism - and a whole lot of
late, unscheduled fire from Hollywood inspirationalism.
* You cannot escape small-town life even, or especially, in <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Sven
Nykvist</PERSON>'s The Ox is about pastoral bigotry and brutalism. A terrible fate
befalls <PERSON>Helge Roos</PERSON> (<ORGANIZATION>Stellan Skarsgard</ORGANIZATION>) when he kills a neighbour's ox to
feed himself and his family during <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION>'s 1860s famine. Flogged and
life-sentenced to hard labour, he is then betrayed by his starving wife for
the sake of their starving child. Nor, gentle reader, does the horror stop
there . . .
This truth-based tragedy of errors makes <PERSON>Thomas Hardy</PERSON> seem like <PERSON>Louisa May
Alcott</PERSON>. It also makes for spellbinding cinema. Writer-director <PERSON>Nykvist</PERSON> is
best-known as a cameraman to the great and famous, having lensed 22 <PERSON>Ingmar
Bergmans</PERSON>, three (serious) <PERSON>Woody Allens</PERSON> and a Tarkovsky.
After a training like that, manic depression or emergent movie mastery can
be the only outcome. Nykvist here makes images that burn the eye. The early
winter scenes are inspired crayon-and-charcoal sketches, all ashy clouds,
ember-yellow sunsets and crispy, silhouetted blacks. They are followed by
the desaturated, mold-grey prison scenes, resembling a mortuarist's photo
album. And even when the film bounces back briefly to May-time, the colours
are caustic, garish, mocking.
Assembling his cast from the <PERSON>Ingmar Bergman</PERSON> Who's Who of Acting - <PERSON>Liv
Ullman</PERSON>, <PERSON>Max Von Sydow</PERSON>, <PERSON>Erland Josephson</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Fanny And Alexander</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Ewa
Frohling</PERSON> as the wife - <PERSON>Nykvist</PERSON> kneads the faces with light and shadow as a
baker kneads dough. There is no flicker of false emotion as he shapes the
story into a picture of provincial life both cruelly plausible and
sumptuously satirical. <PERSON>Von Sydow</PERSON>'s dithery priest and <PERSON>Ullman</PERSON>'s lady of the
manor, specialising in milky-eyed looks and arm's-length kindness, show the
tattered raiment of charity in times of social despair. And <PERSON>Stellan
Skarsgard</PERSON>, an actor whose flayed looks and sleep-robbed eyes haunt the mind,
finds Dostoevskian depth in the hapless ox-killer. In sum: a triumph.
Is there anything else? Yes, but if you have a bus to catch I can run
through them quickly. Best Of The Best 2 is the sequel to a film no one
seems to have seen. Reportedly it starred <PERSON>Eric Roberts</PERSON> (<ORGANIZATION>Julia</ORGANIZATION>'s brother) and
<PERSON>Chris Penn</PERSON> (<PERSON>Sean</PERSON>'s brother), now re-teamed for 90 minutes of cheerful drivel
as two kickboxers trying to kick an evil wall of muscle called <PERSON>Brakus</PERSON> (<PERSON>Ralph
Moeller</PERSON>). Place: <LOCATION>Las Vegas</LOCATION>. Toupee'd <PERSON>Wayne Newton</PERSON>, looking mature enough to
be <PERSON>Isaac</PERSON>'s brother, steals the show as the sleazy emcee.
You can always see the three-year-old drag documentary <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> Is Burning at
the <ORGANIZATION>ICA</ORGANIZATION>. Director <PERSON>Jennie Livingston</PERSON> shows us round <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>'s 'vogueing'
couples, as the entire black and Hispanic poulations of <LOCATION>Brooklyn</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Harlem</LOCATION>
seem to have spent <DATE>1990</DATE> coming out and loudly refusing to go back in again.
Bold, if rather old, stuff.

   BORLANGE, Sweden -- Drinking alone at the Saga Nightclub,
Charlotte Eriksson drifts back to her days as a living
legend.
   "As soon as American guys heard I was Swedish, you could
read their minds," says the 19-year-old drama student, who
spent three of her teen-age years in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
"They expected me to leap right into their bed. That, or leap
out the window and kill myself."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Tapping her foot to the music, <PERSON>Ms. Eriksson</PERSON> scans the bar
for possible dance partners. "Sometimes," she sighs, going
back to her beer, "I wish <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION> was as thrilling as its
reputation."
   In the beginning, <PERSON>Odin</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Frigg</ORGANIZATION> begat Thor -- and
<LOCATION>Scandinavia</LOCATION> begat myths that have multiplied ever since. With
the Norse gods came Vikings: fierce men in bear furs, prone
to rape and pillage. Gradually, the Nordic image thawed,
spawning new emblems. <LOCATION>Norway</LOCATION> has fiords. The Danish have
pastries. <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION> has suicide and sin.
   "I imagined beautiful blondes climbing all over me as soon
as I got off the airplane," says <PERSON>Michael Rosenblum</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>New
York</LOCATION> television producer now working in <LOCATION>Stockholm</LOCATION>. "What a
joke] A lot of them aren't even blond."
   Staring glumly at the cold crayfish on his dinner plate,
he adds: "You can see why they kill themselves. This is the
most boring, depressing place I've ever been."
   Swedes themselves are uneasy with their image, which they
blame on the movies. People see <PERSON>Max von Sydow</PERSON> playing chess
with Death in "The Seventh Seal." They recall the soft-core
porn film "I Am Curious Yellow." They remember <PERSON>Greta Garbo</PERSON>
and <PERSON>Ingrid Bergman</PERSON>. They think Swedes are like their movie
stars. Well, yes and no.
   Separating fact and fiction takes some doing. It is true,
for instance, that most native Swedes are blond. Swedes in
large numbers also are good-looking, though obviously that is
subjective. (Many Swedish men find Norwegian women more
appealing.) And Swedes, generally speaking, have very
permissive attitudes toward birth control, premarital sex and
unmarried couples living together.
   "Blondes don't have more fun," says <PERSON>Nina Yderberg</PERSON> a
<LOCATION>Stockholm</LOCATION> medical student, who is tall, blond and stunning.
She recently got so bored with her love life that she wrote a
magazine piece maintaining that "Swedish men are such bad
lovers, I'd rather sleep with women." The article, which
includes unflattering samples of male pillow talk, has
brought the 25-year-old a lot of attention, none of it
amorous. "I haven't even kissed a man in months," she says.
   Sex isn't the only thing that Swedes complain is
overrated. Young people in particular gripe that their
bureaucratic social-welfare society is over-engineered -- a
sort of <ORGANIZATION>Volvo</ORGANIZATION> writ large: safe, staid, the ultimate family
vehicle. And many speak enviously of the excitements to be
had abroad, where people are less formal and the night life
more exciting.
   "This country is cold and gray, and I'm not just talking
about the weather," says sex therapist <PERSON>Malena Ivrsson</PERSON>, who is
married to a Yugoslav. Adds writer and social critic <PERSON>Jan
Myrdal</PERSON>: "We're almost irrationally rational. It's hard to get
an emotional response from a Swede."
   Television host <PERSON>Robert Aschberg</PERSON> agrees. He recently
invited nudists and anti-nudists to appear together on his
show. The nudists disrobed and, to spice the debate, he asked
the anti-nudists to do as much themselves. They did. <PERSON>Mr.
Aschberg</PERSON> thought the program would cause a stir. It didn't.
   "Nine people stark-naked on TV, and no one cared," he
says. "Not one angry letter or phone call. Nothing."
   In <DATE>summer</DATE>, Swedish women routinely go topless at beach and
pool, as do women elsewhere in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>. But contrary to some
visitors' expectations, strip clubs and sex shops in
<LOCATION>Stockholm</LOCATION> are rare and discreet -- no competition for
<LOCATION>Amsterdam</LOCATION> or <LOCATION>Copenhagen</LOCATION>, tame compared to <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>.
Prostitutes are almost demure. Eva, a 24-year-old making the
rounds of a park near <LOCATION>Stockholm</LOCATION>'s Opera, tries to lure a
foreign visitor by representing herself as "a Swedish sex
machine." But dressed in denims, a windbreaker and Reeboks,
she looks more like a gym teacher than a Toulouse-Lautrec
lady of the evening.
   "Swedish men don't want you looking like a prostitute,"
she explains. "Anyway, I'd freeze in hot pants and halter
top." Asked to describe her clients, she responds, "Your
basic Swedish meatballs. Polite, efficient, no passion --
same as out of bed."
   Swedish levelheadedness extends to, and flows from, social
policy. <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION> was the first country to introduce sex
education in schools. Contraception is freely available to
teen-agers, without parental consent. And teen-agers often
bring friends home to bed, even when parents are on the
premises.
   "Most parents feel this is better than having their
children freeze in cars or parks," says <PERSON>Katarina Lindahl</PERSON>, who
heads <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>National Association for Sexual Information</ORGANIZATION>.
   The permissiveness doesn't seem to encourage promiscuity.
A <DATE>1988</DATE> survey asked Swedes 16 to 23 years of age to name the
most important thing in relationships. Only <PERCENT>1%</PERCENT> cited "good
sexual relations." In part because of contraception, rates of
teen-age pregnancy are comparatively low, and falling. A
survey of Swedish women 20 to 30 found that they had, on
average, five sex partners in their entire lives.
   But the news hasn't made it abroad. During a recent trip
to <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, 19-year-old <ORGANIZATION>Lotta Strand</ORGANIZATION> was asked by a British
man to record a message for his answering machine. He thought
her Swedish accent would "sound sexy," she says.
   <PERSON>Ms. Strand</PERSON>, who lives in <LOCATION>Stockholm</LOCATION>, refused. And she has a
new way of warding off unwanted advances from foreign men. "I
tell them I'm from <LOCATION>Iceland</LOCATION>," she says. "Saying you're Swedish
is suicide."
   An apt image, some would suggest. <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION>, particularly in
winter, seems a stage set for suicide. The country has long,
dark, snowy winters that keep people indoors, often with a
bottle of aquavit to keep them company.
   Swedes, reserved around strangers, can indeed seem gloomy.
"Our national character is best described as Lutheran
melancholia," says <PERSON>Lars Hellsten</PERSON>, a teacher of literature and
philosophy. "The real question," he adds, with a smile, "is
why don't all Swedes kill themselves?"
   Actually, not a remarkable number do. In <DATE>1987</DATE>, <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION>'s
suicide rate was 18.4 per 100,000 people, which is about par
for industrialized countries. The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> rate was a relatively
low 12.7. Hungarians do themselves in at twice the rate of
Swedes.
   Historians say that <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION>'s undeserved reputation began
with a speech by President <PERSON>Eisenhower</PERSON> at the <DATE>1960</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>Republican
National Convention</ORGANIZATION> in which he referred to a socialist
country in the north where "suicide has gone up almost
unbelievably." He was trying to discredit <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION>'s welfare
state, and the suicide myth has survived ever since, with
evident help from <PERSON>Ingmar Bergman</PERSON>, the writer and director of
depressing movies.
   So what is the true Swedish vice?
   "We don't have one, that's the problem," says <PERSON>Anders
Sjogren</PERSON>, a business consultant and part-time therapist.
"We're so busy being reliable and boring that we don't have
time for sin."
   Speaking for himself, <PERSON>Mr. Sjogren</PERSON> thinks he knows of an
antidote to ennui. "I hear <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> girls are really
something," he says. "Maybe I'll go there someday, learn to
surf, meet a blonde."

FT  16 MAY 92 / Arts: An apology for a film festival / Finding two survivors
and a stretcher case at Cannes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUDDENLY THE other night <LOCATION>Cannes</LOCATION> had something worth shouting about.
'Magnifique]' cried a thousand festivalgoers as they watched. 'Sensational]'
'Sacre bleu]' 'The best thing we have seen so far' (<ORGANIZATION>Translate</ORGANIZATION> into the
languages of your choice).
The cause of passion was a firework display. As bouquets of light burst over
the bay, we all wondered why it had taken twenty-odd tons of gunpowder to
prise open emotional responses left untouched by the films. This spectacle
was a film in part. But what a film: laser-projected images of fire and war
and clinching couples - <PERSON>Gable</PERSON> and <PERSON>Leigh</PERSON>, <PERSON>Garbo</PERSON> and <PERSON>Boyer</PERSON>, even <PERSON>Krushchev</PERSON> and
<PERSON>Castro</PERSON> - thrown onto a giant floating screen as the real fireworks exploded
all around.
They say that human beings are united by adversity. But <LOCATION>Cannes</LOCATION>,
pre-fireworks, had been the grimmest get-together in Cote d'Azur memory.
Normally goodhearted festivalgoers avoided each other's eyes lest colleagues
had even worse tales of aesthetic debacle to tell than they. 'Did you see
the Icelandic film about despair in the fishing industry?' (<ORGANIZATION>Asdid
Thorodssen'd Island</ORGANIZATION>). 'No, but I bet it wasn't as bad as that talkative
Canadian movie about the gay murderer who drones on about why he killed his
lover with a kitchen knife' (<PERSON>Jean Baudin</PERSON>'s Being At Home With <PERSON>Claude</PERSON>).
'Well, at least it wasn't an ice pick. Do you know, I just saw the 23rd film
in which . . '
Enough. From a festival resembling an unpleasant accident, let me pick out
two unscathed survivors and one partial stretcher-case that smiled for the
cameras. From <ORGANIZATION>Sweden Bille August's Best Intentions</ORGANIZATION> has a script by - oh how
we need him now - <PERSON>Ingmar Bergman</PERSON>. The film surges majestically through the
century's early years as <PERSON>Bergman</PERSON> recreates the romance and marriage of his
own parents. He is a cold-eyed Lutheran pastor, she a walking nervous
breakdown. Between them, in snowscapes and lakelands that dazzle the eye,
they create the conditions of elegiac dementia into which young Ingmar could
be born.
This is a prequel to <ORGANIZATION>Fanny And Alexander</ORGANIZATION>. It is also a flexi-movie in the
same vein. A 4-hour TV serial co-exists with the three-hour film seen at
<LOCATION>Cannes</LOCATION>; and indeed our only reservation is that we feel we could buy this
story by the yard. (Why not five hours - seven - ten?) But <PERSON>Bergman</PERSON> has lost
none of his skill at paring emotion to the bone and beyond to the marrow.
Quarrel scenes have a lacerating force; reconciliations a melting poignancy.
As for director <PERSON>Bille August</PERSON>, he was the last non-American to win a <LOCATION>Cannes
Golden Palm</LOCATION> with <PERSON>Pelle</PERSON> The Conqueror and he may be the first non-American to
end <ORGANIZATION>Hollywood</ORGANIZATION>'s three-year run in <DATE>1992</DATE>.
The other alive-and-kicking festival item, shown non-competitively in the
Directors Fortnight, was <PERSON>Stacey Cochrane</PERSON>'s My New Gun: a blissful black
comedy about a young <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> suburbanite (<PERSON>Diane Lane</PERSON>) whose life is
transformed when she is given a gun by her security-conscious yuppie husband
(<PERSON>Stephen Collins</PERSON>).
Direct and indirect results: two woundings, one near-fatal case of food
poisonning, the discovery of a lost <ORGANIZATION>Country and Western</ORGANIZATION> singer in hiding
(<PERSON>Tess Harper</PERSON>), an adulterous romance and a friends' wedding that almost
models itself on one of those famous bloodbath nuptials beloved of Dynasty.
The film is sly, wise and very very funny. So at best, with its
spot-the-star cast and trigger-happy satirical zest, is <PERSON>Bob Roberts</PERSON>. <PERSON>Tim
Robbins</PERSON>, deified by <LOCATION>Cannes</LOCATION> as the star of <PERSON>Robert Altman</PERSON>'s anti-Hollywood
spoof The Player (current Golden Palm favourite), wrote, directed and gave
himself the lead role in this Awful Warning romp about a pop singer turned
neo-fascist senatorial candidate.
Gore Vidal turns up as a waspish political veteran and <PERSON>Giancarlo Esposito</PERSON> as
a radical black journalist; plus <PERSON>Susan Sarandon</PERSON>, <PERSON>James Spader</PERSON>, <PERSON>Alan Rickman</PERSON>
and more stars than you can find walking the <LOCATION>Croisette</LOCATION>. If you were watching
for political subtlety, you would leave after five minutes. <PERSON>Robbins</PERSON>'s
targets are made of straw and he peppers them with a blunderbuss. But the
film boasts a snazzy storytelling style - all Steadicam bustle and spitfire
close-ups - and makes deft use of newsreel mock-ups in the style of Citizen
<PERSON>Kane</PERSON>.
Elsewhere, films are going down with all hands at <LOCATION>Cannes</LOCATION> <DATE>1992</DATE>. Even the ones
that begin with a blaze of ambition - like <PERSON>Vincent Ward</PERSON>'s globe-hopping
Eskimo-makes-good tale Map Of The Human Heart or <PERSON>Fernando Solanas</PERSON>'s sardonic
history of post-Columbian <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> The Voyage - are soon sinking towards
oblivion. And as films clock up 2-, 3-, 4-hour running times, panic is
caused in the scheduling department. Some critics have turned up for 8 pm
screenings only to be told that the film began at 7. Not surprisingly, they
adjourn to the nearest bar to fill up with four-star <PERSON>Fernet Branca</PERSON>.
Is there a moral in the artistic decrepitude of this festival? Yes. I
suspect we are seeing the convergence of two catastrophic tendencies to
create a Chaos Theory of late-century cinema. To the <LOCATION>East</LOCATION> as I speak, <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>
is breaking up as a once-rich consortium of individual cultures. It is
becoming a wasteland for co-production carpetbaggers. (Look and quail at
<LOCATION>Cannes</LOCATION> samples like The Last Butterfly, a Nazi melodrama with <PERSON>Tom Courtenay</PERSON>
adrift in ill-dubbed <LOCATION>Czechoslovakia</LOCATION>). And to the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> is hurling at
us its short-attention Video Age no-brainers. Woe upon a festival that has
to open with Basic Instinct and close with the new Tom Cruise vehicle.
No wonder <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>, secure in a middle ground, has contributed two of the
three current favourites for Golden Palm. If you have shirts, prepare to
shred them now. Put one third on <PERSON>Robert Altman</PERSON>'s The Player; one third on
Howards End; and one third on <PERSON>Terence Davies</PERSON>'s touching self-portrait in
celluloid The Long Day Closes. Screened <TIME>last night</TIME>, this proved a hit with
everyone except the French. But then who sets store by the French these
days? They were responsible for mounting this apology for a film festival.

<HEAD>At the Movies: ``Pelle the Conqueror''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The Scandanavians are unsurpassed at filming epic dramas against
the harsh beauty of northern landscapes. <PERSON>Ingmar Bergman</PERSON> has proved
the master of such films. Other contributions have included <PERSON>Jan
Troell</PERSON>'s ``The Emigrants'' and ``The New Land'' (about Swedish
farmers in <LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION>), <PERSON>Bo Wilderberg</PERSON>'s ``<PERSON>Elvira Madigan</PERSON>'' and last
year's Academy Award winner, ``Babette's Feast.''
   Now ``Pelle the Conqueror'' joins that select group. Written and
directed with rare skill by Danish filmmaker <PERSON>Bille August</PERSON>, it is an
impressive achievement, austere yet reachable, sorrowful but
elevating for the soul. The film displays <PERSON>Max Von Sydow</PERSON> at the peak
of his talent. It's hard to imagine any of the world's actors
performing the role with such conviction.
   ``Pelle the Conqueror'' (a confusing title suggesting <PERSON>Arnold
Schwarzenwegger</PERSON> in loincloth) is based on the first volume of the
famed saga by <ORGANIZATION>Martin Andersen Nexo</ORGANIZATION>. The story is told through the
eyes of Pelle (<PERSON>Pelle Hvenegaard</PERSON>), a subteen Swedish boy who
accompanies his widower father, <PERSON>Lasse</PERSON> (<PERSON>Max Von Sydow</PERSON>), on a perilous
adventure early in the century, seeking a new life in the Danish
farm country.
   Their arrival portends the grimness of their future. The farm
owners hire able-bodied immigrants, dismissing Lasse as too old and
his son as too young. Finally the brutal manager of the <ORGANIZATION>Stone Farm</ORGANIZATION>
agrees to take on the pair.
   Pelle finds his new home both thrilling and forbidding. Like most
outsiders, he is reviled and beaten by his schoolmates. But he is
intrigued by drama all around him: the free spirit who challenges
the foreman and pays for it; the womanizing landowner who is
periodically tainted by the mother of his out-of-wedlock child; the
long-suffering landowner's wife who bestows kindness on <PERSON>Pelle</PERSON> and
savage retribution on her husband.
   The boy also watches with growing sorrow his father's frustration
with his mean existence. Every hope that <ORGANIZATION>Lasse</ORGANIZATION> uncovers turns to
dust. When he finds a woman who could make a home for him and the
boy, her husband, believed lost at sea, returns. Despairing of his
luck and ashamed of his cowardice, he turns to drink.
   This brief resume might sound depressing, but ``Pelle the
Conqueror'' isn't. <DATE>August</DATE>'s script is laden with surprises, some
funny, some thrilling, and his camera captures the raw grandeur of
the Danish countryside.
   <PERSON>Von Sydow</PERSON> has never performed more impressively. His Lasse is
downtrodden yet somehow noble, a man befuddled by his inability to
make a better life for himself and his son. Young Hvenegaard, who
never acted before, is miraculous; his bright face mirrors the
wondrous things he sees.
   Released in this country by <ORGANIZATION>Mirimax Films</ORGANIZATION>, ``Pelle the
Conqueror'' is subtitled in English. There is no rating. Running
time: 138 minutes.

<TEXT>
   <PERSON>Lena Olin</PERSON> was a tomboy. She didn't want to be
pretty. She cut her hair short and refused to wear dresses. She
preferred sports to dolls and fighting to tea parties.
   She changed once she turned 13 - no one who's seen ``The
Unbearable Lightness of Being'' and ``Enemies, A Love Story'' would
question that. But watch those films, the way she uncorks a wine
bottle with her teeth or the erotic tension between <PERSON>Olin</PERSON> and other
women and you'll see a masculine spirit that runs much deeper than
a bowler hat.
   And she hasn't stopped looking for new ways to bring that
quality into her professional life. As a Swedish actress, she's
been compared to <PERSON>Garbo</PERSON>, but when <PERSON>Olin</PERSON> speaks of tackling classic
roles it's not only ``Camille'' that's on her mind.
   ``One of my first stage parts was in a comedy called `Able
Drugger,' an English comedy,'' <PERSON>Olin</PERSON>, dressed in jeans and a simple,
white blouse, recalled in a recent interview. ``I played a man and
I enjoyed that. I very much would like to play a man. I'd like to
do `Hamlet.'''
   Hamlet is a tragic male, incapable of making up his mind. But
<PERSON>Olin</PERSON> might be too tough as the Danish prince. Her characters -
<PERSON>Sabina</PERSON> in ``The Unbearable Lightness of Being'' and <PERSON>Masha</PERSON> in
``Enemies, A Love Story'' - are erotic cynics: intelligent,
complex, highly sexual, painfully self-aware.
   There's something otherwordly about them; they're objects of
desire yet very much alone. They make their own rules. Fair play no
longer matters; they've been hurt too often.
   Sabina is an avant-garde artist living in <LOCATION>Czechoslovakia</LOCATION> during
the <DATE>1968</DATE> uprising, a free spirit in an oppressed country, the
mistress of a seductive doctor who can make tugging a curtain seem
pornographic. Masha, for which Olin received an Academy Award
nomination for best supporting actress, is an embittered Holocaust
survivor, a force of life but an even stronger force of death.
   In ``<LOCATION>Havana</LOCATION>,'' her new film, <PERSON>Olin</PERSON> plays <PERSON>Roberta Duran</PERSON>, a Swede
trapped in a ``Casablanca''-like love triangle, torn between
American playboy-gambler <PERSON>Robert Redford</PERSON> and Cuban revolutionary
<PERSON>Raul Julia</PERSON>. <PERSON>Roberta</PERSON> - or <PERSON>Bobbi</PERSON> as she's called - is somewhat softer
than <PERSON>Masha</PERSON> or <LOCATION>Sabina</LOCATION>. She's more passive, easier to manipulate and,
for <PERSON>Olin</PERSON>, an easier person to like.
   ``Sabina's so bored with life, so fed up with life,'' <PERSON>Olin</PERSON> said.
``And <PERSON>Masha</PERSON>'s so distraught. She was hard to live with. I like to
be able to close the door to the studio, but it's very difficult
with some characters. I also felt very vulnerable when I did <PERSON>Bobbi</PERSON>.
I wanted to be good when I did <PERSON>Bobbi</PERSON>, and I kept that with me.
   ``<PERSON>Masha</PERSON> was very hard to come back to every night, to sleep with
every night. You touch areas in yourself that I don't think are
very healthy to touch.''
   Olin, 35, was born in <LOCATION>Stockholm</LOCATION>. Her parents were actors, her
father, <PERSON>Stij Olin</PERSON>, appearing in <PERSON>Ingmar Bergman</PERSON>'s classic ``The
Seventh Seal.'' But they divorced when she was little and for all
her all spirit, she remembered herself as self-conscious and
insecure, more at home with inner thoughts than with the outside
world.
   ``I was a weird child and I still see things differently,'' she
recalled in a soft voice, smiling shyly. ``I always remember very
strange things. I have a capacity to walk in an apartment where
there are boxes and papers, and someone will say, `Excuse the boxes
and papers.' And I'll say, `Oh, I didn't see that.' I think I
concentrate on other things, small things that can be revealing.''
   Acting was the perfect way to express herself, and at age 20
Olin entered the <ORGANIZATION>Royal Dramatic Theater School</ORGANIZATION>, joining <PERSON>Bergman</PERSON>'s
famed company of players. On stage, she starred in the plays of
<ORGANIZATION>Shakespeare</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Strindberg</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Chekhov</ORGANIZATION> and she also worked with
<PERSON>Bergman</PERSON> on films, appearing in ``After the Rehearsal'' and ``Fanny
and Alexander.''
   Olin sees nothing peculiar or silly about her tomboy roots. It
was a phase to build upon rather than outgrow, a yearning to be in
touch with all sides of herself, a rebellion against the rules that
men and women are supposed to obey that went beyond mere
role-playing.
   ``If I ever had a daughter I'd bring her up the same way,
encourage her to do what I did,'' said <PERSON>Olin</PERSON>, a single mother whose
son, <DATE>August</DATE>, is named after <LOCATION>Strindberg</LOCATION>.
   ``I think it's important for everyone to stay open, not to be
afraid, and if you push that way, I think that makes a difference
for an actor. The great thing about <PERSON>Marlon Brando</PERSON>, he's very macho
and all of that, but there's a huge woman in there as well.''

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When it comes to <ORGANIZATION>Shakespeare</ORGANIZATION>, ``Hamlet'' is still
very much the thing.
   In recent months, <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s two large government-subsidized
theaters have tackled the Prince of <LOCATION>Denmark</LOCATION>, and two other <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>
plays are now on using Hamlet as a central character.
   It remains one of the world's favorite plays, and <ORGANIZATION>Hamlet</ORGANIZATION>'s
celebrated soliloquy has become universal, whether in Chinese (``si
hai shi huo''), Swedish (``Att vara eller icke vara'') or English
(``To be or not to be'').
   In <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Patrice Chereau</PERSON>'s production recently swept the <ORGANIZATION>Moliere
Awards</ORGANIZATION>, the French equivalent of <DATE>Broadway</DATE>'s Tony. <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> has
averaged eight major ``Hamlet'' productions every year for the past
three years. <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Public Theater</ORGANIZATION> presented it in <DATE>1986</DATE> with
<PERSON>Kevin Kline</PERSON> as the prince.
   Women have played him, too, notably the great French actress
<PERSON>Sarah Bernhardt</PERSON> a century ago, <PERSON>Dame Judith Andersonand</PERSON> more recently
<PERSON>Diane Venora</PERSON> at the Public in <DATE>1982</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Laurence Olivier</PERSON> called it ``the best play ever written,'' and
his <DATE>1948</DATE> film portrayal was the only <ORGANIZATION>Shakespeare</ORGANIZATION> work ever to win
Academy Awards for best film and best actor.
   Others have tried to shape it to the times. The great
18th-century actor <PERSON>David Garrick</PERSON> hated the graveyard scene. ``I
swore,'' he said, ``that I would not leave the stage 'till I had
rescued that noble play from all the rubbish of the fifth act.''
   The Victorians left out Hamlet's lapses into vernacular, along
with anything else that might portray him as less than a perfect
prince. Nowadays, producers are more apt to drop the subplot
involving the agents and friends of Hamlet's Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern, a trend which in itself inspired a whole,
much-applauded play by British dramatist <PERSON>Tom Stoppard</PERSON> about two
characters who find they do not exist outside the play.
   In <DATE>1987</DATE>, Swedish director <PERSON>Ingmar Bergman</PERSON>'s acclaimed production
with his <ORGANIZATION>Royal Dramatic Theater of Stockholm</ORGANIZATION> had a week-long run in
<LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>, and in <DATE>September</DATE> Russian director <PERSON>Yuri Lyubimov</PERSON> will stage
``Hamlet'' with a British company at the <ORGANIZATION>Leicester Haymarket Theater</ORGANIZATION>.
   Drawn from Scandinavian legend, ``Hamlet'' is about a prince who
comes home from university to discover that his father has been
murdered by his brother who has usurped the throne and married the
queen he has widowed.
   Setting out to clean up the rot in the kingdom of <LOCATION>Denmark</LOCATION>, Hamlet
plunges into a jungle of intrigue, thwarted passion and switched
poisons. He emerges triumphant, only to complete the tragedy by
dying in a sword fight.
   At its most basic, Hamlet is a rattling good revenge yarn. But it
is also that rare play whose significance can continually be
reshaped to meet a society's preconceptions. Thus, audiences over
the ages have seen <LOCATION>Hamlet</LOCATION> as Marxist, capitalist, pacifist,
militarist, aristocrat, populist, Freudian obsessive and man of
action.
   This troubles some actors including <PERSON>Jonathan Pryce</PERSON>, who derides
what he calls the ``Hamlet industry.'' They wonder whether the
play's appeal is also its weakness: whether by applying to
everything and everyone, ``Hamlet'' risks being about nothing in
particular.
   ``Is Hamlet really such a difficult part to get right?'' asks
<PERSON>Lynne Truss</PERSON> in The Listener magazine. ``The answer seems to be that,
on the contrary, it is awfully hard to get it wrong, since any
interpretation seems to be valid.''
   In recent years Londoners have been treated to <PERSON>Roger Rees</PERSON>' dry,
intensely cerebral Hamlet at the <ORGANIZATION>Royal Shakespeare Company</ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON>Peter
Stormare</PERSON>'s manic, military Hamlet for <PERSON>Ingmar Bergman</PERSON>; and now <PERSON>Daniel
Day-Lewis</PERSON>' highly emotional and impetuous Hamlet at the <ORGANIZATION>National</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>Richard Eyre</PERSON>'s production continues the <ORGANIZATION>National</ORGANIZATION>'s tradition of
doing a ``Hamlet'' near the start of each artistic director's
tenure. Day-Lewis, best known for the films ``The Unbearable
Lightness of Being,'' ``My Beautiful Laundrette'' and ``A Room With
a View,'' has inherited a part played in <DATE>1963</DATE> by <PERSON>Peter O'Toole</PERSON> and
in <DATE>1976</DATE> by <PERSON>Albert Finney</PERSON>.
   Also on show are <PERSON>Iris Murdoch</PERSON>'s ``The Black Prince,'' adapted
from her <DATE>1973</DATE> novel, and the revival of <PERSON>Anton Chekhov</PERSON>'s <DATE>1887</DATE>
``Ivanov,'' with <PERSON>Alan Bates</PERSON> as a penniless landowner who sees
himself as a failed Hamlet figure.
   Murdoch, 69, first encountered Hamlet as a school text when she
was 15. She ``an insane passion'' for the work, similar to that of
<PERSON>Bradley Pearson</PERSON>, the sardonic tax inspector of ``The Black Prince''
who comes alive when thinking or speaking of Hamlet.
   ``I became absolutely entranced by it and by Shakespeare
generally,'' she recalled in an interview. ``He's very good on
politics and power ... a great source of inspiration to novelists.''
   From <PERSON>Garrick</PERSON> and <PERSON>Henry Irving</PERSON> through <PERSON>John Barrymore</PERSON>, <PERSON>Olivier</PERSON> and
<PERSON>John Gielgud</PERSON> to today's acting generation, Hamlet remains the hurdle
every classical actor must overcome to attain true celebrity. And
they rarely agree on whether Hamlet is an easy role or a difficult
one.
   ``It's quite easy, because it's such an accommodating part which
adapts itself to the personality of the actor,'' argues <PERSON>Michael
Pennington</PERSON>, who played the role in <DATE>1980</DATE> at <LOCATION>Stratford</LOCATION>.
   But <PERSON>Mark Rylance</PERSON>, who plays ``Hamlet'' in the <ORGANIZATION>Royal Shakespeare
Company</ORGANIZATION>'s current <LOCATION>Stratford</LOCATION> production, disagrees.
   ``I find it utterly enigmatic; as soon as one locates the role,
it changes,'' the 29-year-old actor said in an interview. ``The
challenge is to bring your own jumble of brain cells to the feminine
and masculine qualities which are in conflict in the part. ... A lot
of people cop out of that.''
   Eyre, 46, first directed ``Hamlet'' in an acclaimed <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>
production in <DATE>1980</DATE>, then returned to the play intrigued by its
elasticity.
   ``I came more and more to see the play as an archetype of growing
up, the model for a whole genre of storytelling which has taken over
the novel and films, too,'' he said.
   ``It's about a man trying to accommodate, to come to terms with,
a completely alien political and social world. When he starts off,
<LOCATION>Hamlet</LOCATION> is Everyman, but for the fact that he's a prince.
   ``This panders to our various fantasy aspirations while at the
same time it concurs with our sense of not wanting to grow up, not
wanting to be absorbed by an essentially alien world of
Realpolitik.''

<TEXT>
   When it comes to <ORGANIZATION>Shakespeare</ORGANIZATION>, ``Hamlet'' is still
very much the thing.
   In recent months, <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s two large government-subsidized
theaters have tackled the Prince of <LOCATION>Denmark</LOCATION>, and two other <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>
plays are now on using Hamlet as a central character.
   It remains one of the world's favorite plays, and <ORGANIZATION>Hamlet</ORGANIZATION>'s
celebrated soliloquy has become universal, whether in Chinese (``si
hai shi huo''), Swedish (``Att vara eller icke vara'') or English
(``To be or not to be'').
   In <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Patrice Chereau</PERSON>'s production recently swept the <ORGANIZATION>Moliere
Awards</ORGANIZATION>, the French equivalent of <DATE>Broadway</DATE>'s Tony. <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> has
averaged eight major ``Hamlet'' productions every year for the past
three years. <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Public Theater</ORGANIZATION> presented it in <DATE>1986</DATE> with
<PERSON>Kevin Kline</PERSON> as the prince.
   Women have played him, too, notably the great French actress
<PERSON>Sarah Bernhardt</PERSON> a century ago, <PERSON>Dame Judith Andersonand</PERSON> more recently
<PERSON>Diane Venora</PERSON> at the Public in <DATE>1982</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Laurence Olivier</PERSON> called it ``the best play ever written,'' and
his <DATE>1948</DATE> film portrayal was the only <ORGANIZATION>Shakespeare</ORGANIZATION> work ever to win
Academy Awards for best film and best actor.
   Others have tried to shape it to the times. The great
18th-century actor <PERSON>David Garrick</PERSON> hated the graveyard scene. ``I
swore,'' he said, ``that I would not leave the stage 'till I had
rescued that noble play from all the rubbish of the fifth act.''
   The Victorians left out Hamlet's lapses into vernacular, along
with anything else that might portray him as less than a perfect
prince. Nowadays, producers are more apt to drop the subplot
involving the agents and friends of Hamlet's Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern, a trend which in itself inspired a whole,
much-applauded play by British dramatist <PERSON>Tom Stoppard</PERSON> about two
characters who find they do not exist outside the play.
   In <DATE>1987</DATE>, Swedish director <PERSON>Ingmar Bergman</PERSON>'s acclaimed production
with his <ORGANIZATION>Royal Dramatic Theater of Stockholm</ORGANIZATION> had a week-long run in
<LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>, and in <DATE>September</DATE> Russian director <PERSON>Yuri Lyubimov</PERSON> will stage

<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After years of TV addiction, Italians are finding
their way out of the house and rediscovering the pleasures of
theatergoing.
   Internationally known actors are turning down movie scripts in
favor of the stage, and spectators are responding by forming ticket
lines at dawn to get into the hottest shows.
   <PERSON>Marcello Mastroianni</PERSON> has tackled Russian drama. Swedish film star
<PERSON>Ingrid Thulin</PERSON> _ the sensuous woman in <PERSON>Ingmar Bergman</PERSON>'s classic <DATE>1957</DATE>
film ``Wild Strawberries'' _ plays a domineering mother in a tragedy
by the Spanish playwright <PERSON>Federico Garcia Lorca</PERSON>.
   Actress <PERSON>Monica Vitti</PERSON> is being peppered with offers to bring her
hilarious performance as a brash reporter in <PERSON>Ben Hecht</PERSON>'s ``The Front
Page'' back to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>.
   ``After more than a decade-long love affair with television,
Italians are once more thirsty for their roots of great comedy and
tragedy,'' says <ORGANIZATION>University of Rome</ORGANIZATION> sociology Professor <PERSON>Alberto
Abruzzese</PERSON>.
   ``They want to be moved by real-life sounds and be tickled by the
comedians they saw on the screen.''
   Last year, movie attendance in <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> dropped by <PERCENT>18 percent</PERCENT>. While
movie houses have been closing throughout the country, new theaters
have opened in <LOCATION>Naples</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Florence</LOCATION> and smaller cities to bring the
total to 1,700 nationwide.
   Thulin, one of <PERSON>Bergman</PERSON>'s favorite actresses, has returned to the
stage after a 20-year absence in <LOCATION>Lorca</LOCATION>'s ``The House of <PERSON>Bernarda
Alba</PERSON>'' which is presently on tour in <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>.
   Bergman himself will come to <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> this year to direct an Italian
version of <PERSON>Eugene O'Neill</PERSON>'s ``Long Day's Journey Into Night.''
   Mastroianni's performance in <PERSON>Nikita Michailov</PERSON>'s ``Mechanical
Pianola'' produced a nightly traffic jam in <LOCATION>Rome</LOCATION>'s central <LOCATION>Piazza
Argentina</LOCATION>. They play is adapted from a short story by <ORGANIZATION>Chekhov</ORGANIZATION>.
Mastroianni told interviewers he hadn't felt so thrilled since he
won an Oscar nomination for his role in ``Dark Eyes'' three years
ago.
   Comedian <PERSON>Ugo Tognazzi</PERSON> riled a few government ministers and
triggered controversy by improvising lines about corruption in high
places during his stage version of Moliere's classic ``The Miser.''
   Italians spent <MONEY>$118 million</MONEY> on theater tickets in <DATE>1987</DATE> _ a <PERCENT>23
percent</PERCENT> increase from <DATE>1986</DATE>, and <DATE>1988</DATE> figures point to another <PERCENT>20
percent</PERCENT> jump. During that period, the average price of an orchestra
seat increased only about <PERCENT>16 percent</PERCENT>, from <MONEY>$18</MONEY> to <MONEY>$21</MONEY>.
   Government statistics show that one out of five Italians attended
some sort of theater performance in <DATE>1988</DATE>.
   Just as in Roman times the government organized theater events
for its people, today's network of 14 state-subsidized theaters,
offer stage variety that ranges from translations of Broadway hits
to Greek tragedy to Italian classics.
   Post avant-garde performances and experimental groups at 500
private theaters and four drama schools also get a share of the <MONEY>$42
million</MONEY> which the Italian government annually allocates to encourage
the theater industry.
   <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>'s ancient theater tradition has its roots in the classics
of Greek theater _ tragedy, comedy and satire. In medieval times,
religious themes were popular.
   During the Renaissance a new form based on classic theater was
shaped by <ORGANIZATION>Machiavelli</ORGANIZATION> and others. It gave way to the commedia
dell'arte which dominated <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> and most of <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> until the end of
the <DATE>1700s</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Luigi Pirandello</PERSON>, master of <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>'s 20th-century theater, focused
on the condition of the modern man.
   While the classics are still popular, they have competition from
Broadway-style productions.
   <PERSON>Vitti</PERSON>, who starred in an all-woman version of <PERSON>Neil Simon</PERSON>'s ``Odd
Couple'' last year, has been touring <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> in ``Front Page.''
   ``The success has been incredible,'' she said. ``Spectators have
stood on line all night in <LOCATION>Turin</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Lucca</LOCATION>. Police have had to

   After years of TV addiction, Italians are finding
their way out of the house and rediscovering the pleasures of
theatergoing.
   Internationally known actors are turning down movie scripts in
favor of the stage, and spectators are responding by forming ticket
lines at dawn to get into the hottest shows.
   <PERSON>Marcello Mastroianni</PERSON> has tackled Russian drama. Swedish film star
<PERSON>Ingrid Thulin</PERSON> _ the sensuous woman in <PERSON>Ingmar Bergman</PERSON>'s classic <DATE>1957</DATE>
film ``Wild Strawberries'' _ plays a domineering mother in a tragedy
by the Spanish playwright <PERSON>Federico Garcia Lorca</PERSON>.
   Actress <PERSON>Monica Vitti</PERSON> is being peppered with offers to bring her
hilarious performance as a brash reporter in <PERSON>Ben Hecht</PERSON>'s ``The Front
Page'' back to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>.
   ``After more than a decade-long love affair with television,
Italians are once more thirsty for their roots of great comedy and
tragedy,'' says <ORGANIZATION>University of Rome</ORGANIZATION> sociology Professor <PERSON>Alberto
Abruzzese</PERSON>.
   ``They want to be moved by real-life sounds and be tickled by the
comedians they saw on the screen.''
   Last year, movie attendance in <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> dropped by <PERCENT>18 percent</PERCENT>. While
movie houses have been closing throughout the country, new theaters
have opened in <LOCATION>Naples</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Florence</LOCATION> and smaller cities to bring the
total to 1,700 nationwide.
   Thulin, one of <PERSON>Bergman</PERSON>'s favorite actresses, has returned to the
stage after a 20-year absence in <LOCATION>Lorca</LOCATION>'s ``The House of <PERSON>Bernarda
Alba</PERSON>'' which is presently on tour in <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>.
   Bergman himself will come to <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> this year to direct an Italian
version of <PERSON>Eugene O'Neill</PERSON>'s ``Long Day's Journey Into Night.''
   Mastroianni's performance in <PERSON>Nikita Michailov</PERSON>'s ``Mechanical
Pianola'' produced a nightly traffic jam in <LOCATION>Rome</LOCATION>'s central <LOCATION>Piazza
Argentina</LOCATION>. They play is adapted from a short story by <ORGANIZATION>Chekhov</ORGANIZATION>.
Mastroianni told interviewers he hadn't felt so thrilled since he
won an Oscar nomination for his role in ``Dark Eyes'' three years
ago.
   Comedian <PERSON>Ugo Tognazzi</PERSON> riled a few government ministers and
triggered controversy by improvising lines about corruption in high
places during his stage version of Moliere's classic ``The Miser.''
   Italians spent <MONEY>$118 million</MONEY> on theater tickets in <DATE>1987</DATE> _ a <PERCENT>23
percent</PERCENT> increase from <DATE>1986</DATE>, and <DATE>1988</DATE> figures point to another <PERCENT>20
percent</PERCENT> jump. During that period, the average price of an orchestra
seat increased only about <PERCENT>16 percent</PERCENT>, from <MONEY>$18</MONEY> to <MONEY>$21</MONEY>.
   Government statistics show that one out of five Italians attended
some sort of theater performance in <DATE>1988</DATE>.
   Just as in Roman times the government organized theater events
for its people, today's network of 14 state-subsidized theaters,
offer stage variety that ranges from translations of Broadway hits
to Greek tragedy to Italian classics.
   Post avant-garde performances and experimental groups at 500
private theaters and four drama schools also get a share of the <MONEY>$42
million</MONEY> which the Italian government annually allocates to encourage
the theater industry.
   <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>'s ancient theater tradition has its roots in the classics
of Greek theater _ tragedy, comedy and satire. In medieval times,
religious themes were popular.
   During the Renaissance a new form based on classic theater was
shaped by <ORGANIZATION>Machiavelli</ORGANIZATION> and others. It gave way to the commedia
dell'arte which dominated <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> and most of <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> until the end of
the <DATE>1700s</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Luigi Pirandello</PERSON>, master of <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>'s 20th-century theater, focused
on the condition of the modern man.
   While the classics are still popular, they have competition from
Broadway-style productions.
   <PERSON>Vitti</PERSON>, who starred in an all-woman version of <PERSON>Neil Simon</PERSON>'s ``Odd
Couple'' last year, has been touring <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> in ``Front Page.''
   ``The success has been incredible,'' she said. ``Spectators have
stood on line all night in <LOCATION>Turin</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Lucca</LOCATION>. Police have had to
intervene to stop punchups over tickets, and we're still going
strong after four months on tour.''
   <PERSON>Vitti</PERSON> has received offers to bring the show to <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Los
Angeles</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Buenos Aires</PERSON>, but her fear of flying makes her hesitate.
   A scuffle erupted New Year's Eve in <LOCATION>Milan</LOCATION> over the presentation
of ``Trojan Women'' in ancient Greek. Fifty spectators fought over
the remaining four tickets on sale at a theater.
   Other serious dramas, including works by <ORGANIZATION>Shakespeare</ORGANIZATION> and
<PERSON>Pirandello</PERSON>, are playing to sold-out crowds. <PERSON>Andrea Jonasson</PERSON>, the
Swedish wife of <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>'s best-known theater director <PERSON>Giorgio
Strehler</PERSON>, alternated lines in Italian and German in <LOCATION>Pirandello</LOCATION>'s
Berlin-based drama on lost identity, ``As You Desire Me.''

At the <ORGANIZATION>Newport Theatre Arts Center</ORGANIZATION>, "A Little Night Music" has a pretty face: 
<PERSON>Gil Morales</PERSON>' sets are airy and romantic, and <PERSON>Dan McWest</PERSON>'s costumes, fetching 
but not overly bright, complement the environment nicely. 
</P>
<P>
The acting too was colorful at <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>'s performance. But the cast, 
directed by <PERSON>D. Jay Bradley</PERSON>, often struggled with <PERSON>Stephen Sondheim</PERSON>'s score, a 
relatively challenging collection of songs in three-quarter time. 
</P>
<P>
"A Little Night Music," inspired by the <PERSON>Ingmar Bergman</PERSON> film "Smiles of a <ORGANIZATION>Summer 
Night</ORGANIZATION>," offers a humorous take on love and lust. 
</P>
<P>
Just about all its characters have to grapple with annoying libidos while 
attempting to nurture feelings of a more "pure" nature. 
</P>
<P>
Everything comes to a head during a weekend in the country. Middle-aged 
<PERSON>Fredrick</PERSON> (Jim Rule) is married to lovely, naive Anne (<PERSON>CeCe Moore</PERSON>) but longs for 
the experienced <PERSON>Desiree</PERSON> (<ORGANIZATION>Mary Tuck</ORGANIZATION>), an old flame. 
</P>
<P>
She has taken the vainglorious Count <PERSON>Malcolm</PERSON> (<PERSON>Jeff Paul</PERSON>) as a lover. He, in 
turn, has a witty, vindictive wife (scene-swiping <PERSON>Diane Botnick</PERSON>). 
</P>
<P>
As <PERSON>Fredrick</PERSON>, Rule may not look like much of a romantic figure, but he does lend 
the role a weary dignity that is close to heroic, and he brings a decent 
singing voice to the proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
Tuck's <LOCATION>Desiree</LOCATION> is appropriately vivacious and her handling of "Send in the 
Clowns," while not the showstopper it can be, is gently felt. 
</P>
<P>
Paul scores points with his pompous portrayal, while <PERSON>Botnick</PERSON> gives the show its 
giddiest moments. 
</P>
<P>
'A LITTLE NIGHT MUSIC' 
</P>
<P>
A Newport Theatre Arts Center production of the <PERSON>Stephen Sondheim</PERSON> (music and 
lyrics) and <PERSON>Hugh Wheeler</PERSON> (book) musical. Directed by <PERSON>D. Jay Bradley</PERSON>. With <PERSON>Mark

The whimsical and poignant <DATE>1985</DATE> Back to the Future (NBC <DATE>Sunday</DATE> at <TIME>8 p.m.</TIME>) finds

father. 
</P>
<P>
The Witches of Eastwick (ABC <DATE>Sunday</DATE> at <TIME>9 p.m.</TIME>) was a popular success even 
though it turned the <PERSON>John Updike</PERSON> novel upside down and inside out. <PERSON>Jack 
Nicholson</PERSON> is a joy as a devil of a fellow who materializes in a staid <LOCATION>New 
England</LOCATION> community in which three single women (<ORGANIZATION>Cher</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Susan Sarandon</PERSON> and 
<PERSON>Michelle Pfeiffer</PERSON>) pine for some male company. 
</P>
<P>
Call Me (Channel 13 <DATE>Monday</DATE> at <TIME>8 p.m.</TIME>) is an ambitious but flawed <DATE>1988</DATE> 
lady-in-distress thriller about a young <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION> photographer/reporter 
(<PERSON>Patricia Charbonneau</PERSON>), plagued by both an obscene phone caller and a drug 
gang.

<ORGANIZATION>Olivia Newton-John</ORGANIZATION> makes her dramatic debut on TV in the contemporary fairy

parish school. Warning: It's been colorized. 
</P>
<P>
The <DATE>1989</DATE> Fletch Lives (CBS <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> at <TIME>9 p.m.</TIME>) is the ultimate comedy of 
condescension, a movie with a hero whose every other line of dialogue is a 
snide wisecrack, directed at a fool. Starring Chevy Chase, who created Fletch 
in the <DATE>1985</DATE> movie of the same name. 
</P>
<P>
Drawing from personal experience, writer <PERSON>Bo Goldman</PERSON> contributed a script to the 
<DATE>1982</DATE> Shoot the <PERSON>Moon</PERSON> (Channel 5 <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> at <TIME>8 p.m.</TIME>) that made it one of the 
year's best, an exceedingly painful and persuasive account of the breakup of a 
marriage. Directed by <PERSON>Alan Parker</PERSON> and starring <PERSON>Albert Finney</PERSON> and <PERSON>Diane Keaton</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
In the <DATE>1982 Diner</DATE> (Channel 5 <DATE>Thursday</DATE> at <TIME>8 p.m.</TIME>), <PERSON>Barry Levinson</PERSON> rescues our 
memories of the late '50s and early '60s from the high gloss that TV has put on

<P>
Christmas in <LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION> (Channel 5 <DATE>Saturday</DATE> at <TIME>8 p.m.</TIME>) is a warm wartime

on orders of her boss (<PERSON>Charles Coburn</PERSON>) -- the only hitch is that she can't

<P>
Fanny and <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> (Channel 28 <DATE>Saturday</DATE> at <TIME>9 p.m.</TIME>), <PERSON>Ingmar Bergman</PERSON>'s great

this turn-of-the-century test-of-the-spirit saga centers on two children, a

<HEAD>Luck Combines With Hard Work for Prize-Winning Danish Director</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLES FERRO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bille <DATE>August</DATE> claims he is not
superstitious. But the Danish director admits that while filming the
award-winning ``Pelle the Conquerer'' he was persecuted by good luck.
   During six months of shooting, storms appeared on cue and
freakish weather added just the right touch of ice to the <LOCATION>Baltic Sea</LOCATION>
for a critical scene.
   ``Pelle'' is up for an Oscar as best foreign film, and Swedish
star <PERSON>Max von Sydow</PERSON> is nominated for best actor in the 61st annual
Academy Awards, to be announced <DATE>March 29</DATE>.
   Though the movie captured the Golden Palm at <LOCATION>Cannes</LOCATION> for best film
and won an <ORGANIZATION>American Golden Globe</ORGANIZATION>, <DATE>August</DATE> is ambivalent about such
honors.
   ``I respect the value of awards, but it feels odd to be competing
with other filmmakers. I'd rather just be a colleague,' he said.
   Before the Oscar nominations, <DATE>August</DATE> generated <ORGANIZATION>Hollywood</ORGANIZATION>'s
interest with last year's ``Twist and Shout,'' a film about Danish
teen-agers in the <DATE>1960s</DATE>. Offers for new pictures came in, but he
said he didn't care for the manuscripts or the conditions.
   Then he read ``The House of the Spirits,'' by <PERSON>Isabel Allende</PERSON>, a
San Francisco-based author. The book traces 70 years of history in
her native <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>.
   Other studios were chasing Allende to sell the movie rights but
she held them off, unconvinced that her story of hatred, fears and
loves could be transformed into a movie.
   <DATE>August</DATE> said he practically forced her to watch ``Pelle,'' which
he had just put in the can.
   ``She was reserved after the screening and would make no
decision, so I took my film and went home, disappointed,'' he said
in an interview. The next day Allende called him and said he was the
only director she wanted to film her book. The <ORGANIZATION>Warner Bros.</ORGANIZATION> project
will be filmed in <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> in English.
   ``It is very exciting for me,'' <DATE>August</DATE> said. ``American studios
have the capacity for larger projects and nearly an endless pool of
good screen actors, whereas in <LOCATION>Scandinavia</LOCATION> the number of good screen
actors is limited.
   ``In the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> there are good technicians, economic
resources and distribution is unbelievably effective.''
   August never looks beyond his current project. ``I am monogamous
to the project I'm working on and don't flirt with future ideas,''
he said. ``Now I am being true to `The <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> of the Spirits.'''
   Good fortune seemed to pursue the shooting of ``Pelle the
Conquerer,'' <PERSON>Martin Andersen Nexoe</PERSON>'s <DATE>1906</DATE> novel about Swedish
immigrants in <LOCATION>Denmark</LOCATION>, shot on the Baltic island of <LOCATION>Bornholm</LOCATION>.
   When a 60-year-old fisherman heard that the opening scene _ ships
sailing through dense fog _ was scheduled for <DATE>Oct. 8</DATE>, his birthday,
he reassured the director that as far back as he could recall there
had always been a storm on that date. As if on order, the storm that
hit <LOCATION>Bornholm</LOCATION> that day was preceeded by thick fog.
   Three days before the crew was to film <PERSON>Pelle</PERSON> escaping from his
tormentors by hopping across a cluster of ice floes, the <LOCATION>Baltic</LOCATION> was
totally free of ice. Temperatures suddenly plunged and froze the sea
into solid ice. Then an on-shore wind the evening before shooting
activated a warm current that created the perfect floes on which the
boy made his escape.
   <DATE>August</DATE> says the harder you work, the luckier you get. ``It is the
director's job to anticipate problems with the crew, weather, to
figure out how actors will react on that day,'' he said. ``Only when
every detail is in place can you begin to experiment.''
   The title role was played by <PERSON>Pelle Hvenegaard</PERSON>, who was chosen
from among 3,000 boys. Although he is Danish, his lines at the start
of the movie are in a southern Swedish dialect which he learned from
a tutor.
   Non-Scandinavian audiences will miss the transition from Swedish
to Danish, but <DATE>August</DATE> believes it doesn't matter. ``Pelle has
universal, international qualities, emotions that can be understood
by all,'' he said.
   ``But I think it's a mistake to make `international films,' to
polish them down until they are neutered. A film needs identity. The
best I've seen have this element,'' he said.
   Working with <PERSON>von Sydow</PERSON>, a veteran of 40 foreign films who played
in some of <PERSON>Ingmar Bergman</PERSON>'s best pictures, was one of the greatest
experiences of his directing career, <DATE>August</DATE> said.

FT  20 MAY 92 / Arts: Quirks of fate supplement the prize line-up - Cannes
Film Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At my prep school they used to show a feature film on the <TIME>last night</TIME> of
term. No matter what it was - <PERSON>Citizen Kane</PERSON> or Carry On Up The <PERSON>Khyber</PERSON> - the
same air of punch-drunk euphoria reigned. The assembled schoolboys knew that
their bags were packed and that there were 12 hours to freedom.
It was the same at the end of the <ORGANIZATION>45th Cannes Film Festival</ORGANIZATION>. We had written
our final exam papers and attended every competition sitting; soon we would
hear about the prizes. Now all we had to do was to watch <PERSON>Tom Cruise</PERSON> in the
non-competitive closing movie Far And Away. This exuberant load of tosh, the
first film shot in 65-millimetre since Ryan's Daughter, has Cruise as a
young Irish peasant who streetfights his way from <LOCATION>Connemara</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION>, via
<LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>, in the 1890s while falling in love with <PERSON>Nicole Kidman</PERSON> (aka Cruise's
offscreen girlfriend).
The <LOCATION>Cannes</LOCATION> audience loved the film. They cheered when Cruise first kisses
<PERSON>Kidman</PERSON> in front of a snow-patterned window with tinkly Christmas harp music
from John (ET) <ORGANIZATION>Williams</ORGANIZATION>. They cheered the climactic <LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION> land race and
ensuing punch-up between hero and villain for <PERSON>Miss Kidman</PERSON>'s hand. Most of
all they cheered the fact that <LOCATION>Cannes</LOCATION> had nothing left to throw at them. Now
more than ever was it rich to leave.
The final days brought some piquant addenda, but they were provided less by
<ORGANIZATION>Hollywood</ORGANIZATION> than by <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION>'s shoestring divisions. The expected
mega-treats disappointed. <PERSON>David Lynch</PERSON>'s Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me is a
catchpenny prequel to the TV series; <PERSON>Sidney Lumet</PERSON>'s A Stranger Among Us is a
daft cop thriller with <PERSON>Melanie Griffith</PERSON> going undercover among <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>'s
Hasidic Jews, and <PERSON>Gary Sinise</PERSON>'s Of Mice And Men is a <PERSON>Steinbeck</PERSON> adaptation
notable only for <PERSON>John Malkovich</PERSON>'s touching Lenny.
I enjoyed far more two lesser-budget films drawn from their makers' own
lives. In the <ORGANIZATION>Directors Fortnight</ORGANIZATION> actor <PERSON>John Turturro</PERSON> presented his
writing-directing debut Mac. This low-budget tale of a self-made
Italian-American housebuilder (<PERSON>Turturro</PERSON>) and his battle for honest values in
a corrupt world is a touch loudhailed: like an <PERSON>Arthur Miller</PERSON> script directed
by <PERSON>Federico Fellini</PERSON>. But at best it is also powerfully funny, with <PERSON>Turturro</PERSON>
a marvel in the lead role based on his own father.
From <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> came <PERSON>Jean-Claude Lauzon</PERSON>'s Leolo. The 12-year-old hero is the
film-maker himself, growing up in a ramshackle family flat in <DATE>1960s Montreal</DATE>
where puberty, poverty and an army of potty relatives surge around him.
Especially eye-catching are <LOCATION>Grandpa</LOCATION>, who is dispatched to a mental asylum
during the brief intervals when <PERSON>Leolo</PERSON> is not trying to kill him, and
musclebound Big Brother who trains himself to look like <PERSON>A. Schwarzenegger</PERSON>
but still gets sand kicked in his face by any passer-by. Like Mac the film
is loud, episodic and all' Italiana. It is also witty, infectious and
winningly candid about sexual self-discovery.
The last days of <LOCATION>Cannes</LOCATION> are devoted in part to catching up with missed films
that colleagues tell you are masterpieces. This is never a gratifying
pastime. Either the colleague is right, in which case you are late with the
scoop. Or the colleague is wrong, in which case you want to brain him.
Braining has been a la mode at <LOCATION>Cannes</LOCATION> in <DATE>1992</DATE>. Top of the films I could have
spent my life without seeing is <PERSON>Victor Erice</PERSON>'s The Sun In The Quince Tree,
even though it shared the Prix du Jury and won the <ORGANIZATION>International Critics
Prize</ORGANIZATION>. This 2 1/2 -hour Spanish docudrama about a painter painting, yes, a
sunlit quince tree manages the remarkable feat of seeming both artless and
pretentious. In a grainy mixture of film and video, it drones on trying to
achieve its quasi-religious minimalism. But we never feel cinematically the
sensual magic of the artistic process, proclaimed in words by the real-life
painter <PERSON>Antonio Lopez</PERSON>. Nor do we know why there are so many extracurricular
shots of railway lines or TV sets glowing in night apartments or <PERSON>Mrs Lopez</PERSON>
pottering around the house.
So we come to the <ORGANIZATION>45th Cannes Film Festival</ORGANIZATION> prizes. Jury president <PERSON>Gerard
Depardieu</PERSON> walked onto the stage, with that hunched-shouldered rolling gait
we know from a hundred French movies, like a bear searching for honey. And
soon we knew which honey-pot he was going for. The Palme d'Or winner was
Bille <DATE>August</DATE>'s Best Intentions, praised on this page <DATE>last week</DATE> and cheered
again at <LOCATION>Cannes</LOCATION> <TIME>last night</TIME>. The majestic Ingmar Bergman-scripted period
epic, based on the lives of <ORGANIZATION>Ingmar</ORGANIZATION>'s own parents, also won Best Actress for
<LOCATION>Pernilla</LOCATION> <DATE>August</DATE>, the director's wife, who played <PERSON>Bergman</PERSON>'s mother.
If you can cope with that dynastic tangle, how about the evening's other
coincidences and convolutions? America's The Player, as well as winning Best
Director for <PERSON>Robert Altman</PERSON>, won Best Actor for <PERSON>Tim Robbins</PERSON>, seen here most
recently squiring his first film as director - the amiable political satire
<PERSON>Bob Roberts</PERSON> - through the festival. And <PERSON>John Turturro</PERSON>, last year's <LOCATION>Cannes</LOCATION>
Best Actor for <PERSON>Barton Fink</PERSON>, also brought his directing debut to <LOCATION>Cannes</LOCATION>, the
aforementioned Mac, and ran off with the prestigious Camera d'Or award for
<ORGANIZATION>Best First Feature</ORGANIZATION>.
One other <LOCATION>Cannes</LOCATION> quirk of fate. Bille <DATE>August</DATE> was the first non-American to
win the Palme d'Or for four years. The last non-American to win the prize
was - <DATE>Bille August</DATE>. That was for <ORGANIZATION>Pelle The Conqueror</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1988</DATE>. What a tangled
web the film festival world weaves. This writer is now awarding himself a
personal Palme d'Or for getting through it all - the confusions,
coincidences and critical rigours - and is departing into well-fed anonymity
in central <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>.

CRITIC AT LARGE: WOODY WOOING A NEW MUSE WITH 'CRIMES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES CHAMPLIN, TIMES ARTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The tombstone-style ad <PERSON>Woody Allen</PERSON> has decreed for his new film "Crimes and 
Misdemeanors" is startling in its lack of startle. No pulsating quotes, no 
searing ad line, no pretty faces, no drawn gun, no bared bosom; just the title 
in large letters adrift in a sea of white space, with the cast and crew in much 
smaller type and <PERSON>Allen</PERSON>'s name nestled inconspicuously among the other players. 
</P>
<P>
A drawn gun and several bared bosoms are implicit although not revealed in the 
film's contents, and ad lines of incendiary power would be possible ("When Love 
Dies . . . The Hard Way," and so on). 
</P>
<P>
The ad may (or may not) be a distributor's nightmare. Despite his critical 
reputation, <PERSON>Allen</PERSON> has never been a consistently big box-office attraction. The 
ad can also be variously interpreted as one man's modesty and his earnest 
rebellion against customary hype, or it can be viewed as a kind of inverted 
arrogance that says <PERSON>Allen</PERSON>'s work does not require the hard sell. 
</P>
<P>
The truth is that the ad will probably work as well as and conceivably better 
than another kind of ad would have. Word of mouth sells or kills most films, 
and <PERSON>Allen</PERSON> has a hard-core following which amplifies word of mouth when <PERSON>Allen</PERSON> is 
on form. 
</P>
<P>
And the fact is that "Crimes and Misdemeanors" reaffirms <PERSON>Allen</PERSON>'s status as the 
most persistently personal, original and provocative of all <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> film makers. 
It is one of his best films. 
</P>
<P>
As has been said about <PERSON>Ken Russell</PERSON> and a few other obstreperously 
individualistic creators, <PERSON>Allen</PERSON>'s less successful films are more interesting 
than most directors' smooth triumphs. "Interiors," "<DATE>September</DATE>" and "Another 
Woman" may have fizzled at the box office, but in their examination of 
characters and relationships and in their capturing of moods and environments 
they can't accurately be called failures. 
</P>
<P>
In "Crimes and Misdemeanors," as <PERSON>Michael Wilmington</PERSON> pointed out in an eloquent 
review <DATE>last week</DATE>, <PERSON>Allen</PERSON> has done what many of his fainter-hearted admirers have 
beseeched him to do, which is leaven the serious stuff with a few good jokes. 
</P>
<P>
There is a sizable cargo of laughs in "Crimes and Misdemeanors," some of them 
<PERSON>Allen</PERSON>'s sardonic one-liners as a failed documentary-maker, scorned husband and 
rejected lover. More of them derive from the character <PERSON>Allen</PERSON> created for <PERSON>Alan 
Alda</PERSON> to play (dazzlingly well) as a lecherous, overbearing, egocentric producer 
of television comedy. Alda will call to mind, at least in the industry, all or 
part of several real life models. 
</P>
<P>
What is noteworthy about the humor, which leavens the whole piece, is that it 
exists within <PERSON>Allen</PERSON>'s darkest film yet. 
</P>
<P>
His pessimism has seemed real enough in several of the films. The characters he 
has played have often as not lost the girl. Like <PERSON>Chaplin</PERSON>'s Tramp, the 
collective <PERSON>Woody</PERSON> has gone on alone, with a wry joke instead of a strut. 
</P>
<P>
The disappointments <PERSON>Allen</PERSON> rendered on <PERSON>Mia Farrow</PERSON> in "Purple Rose of <LOCATION>Cairo</LOCATION>," 
masked only slightly by his technically ingenious homage to the movies as our 
principal source of solace, were bitterly cruel. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Allen</PERSON>'s pessimism lifted measurably in "Hannah and Her Sisters," which glowed 
with an uncommon family warmth. Yet much of the warmth began, or flowed from, 
an acceptance of the world as it is and a setting-aside of the infidelities, 
the estrangements, the disappointments and betrayals of the past. Ripeness, and 
forgiveness, were all. 
</P>
<P>
In "Crimes and Misdemeanors" -- the echoing parallel to the <PERSON>Ingmar Bergman</PERSON> 
title "Cries and Whispers" is intriguingly close -- <PERSON>Allen</PERSON> seems to take the 
idea of ripeness, of a philosophical acceptance of reality, even further than 
before. 
</P>
<P>
The film maker <PERSON>Allen</PERSON> plays is making a documentary on a German-Jewish 
philosopher. With his thick accent, the philosopher can be taken as a parody of 
an academic type. He is also a comment on the film maker's unworldliness. On 
the evidence, <ORGANIZATION>PBS</ORGANIZATION> would be hesitant to show the documentary at <TIME>midnight</TIME>, even 
if they could get it for nothing. 
</P>
<P>
But the philosopher is saying desperately coherent things, depicting the 
universe as cold, indifferent and mechanistic, warmed only by such efforts as 
human beings make to create warmth within it. 
</P>
<P>
The documentary is left unfinished because the philosopher has evidently found 
the efforts to warm the universe unavailing. The documentary sequence is played 
off against <PERSON>Allen</PERSON>'s growing infatuation with the production assistant played by 
<PERSON>Mia Farrow</PERSON>. It is not unlike a magician's use of indirection, making you 
realize only later what was really going on. 
</P>
<P>
As reviews have noted, "Crimes and Misdemeanors" is the most melodramatic of 
<PERSON>Allen</PERSON>'s films: <PERSON>Martin Landau</PERSON>, in another superb performance, conspiring with 
his brother <PERSON>Jerry Ohrbach</PERSON> in the murder of a discarded mistress who is making 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
In this movie <PERSON>Allen</PERSON> is wrestling with a lot of major stuff, love and the death 
of love, guilt and punishment (if any), and, embracing all else, the question 
of the existence and nature of God. 
</P>
<P>
It's hard to think of another film maker who could give us a Seder table 
argument about an all-seeing God (insisted upon by <PERSON>Allen</PERSON>'s devout father) 
against a cynical worldly pragmatism voiced by an atheistic aunt. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Ingmar Bergman</PERSON> has often dealt with faith and the death of faith, the pains of 
spiritual aridity, but never a laugh in a carload, though affecting in other 
ways. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Allen</PERSON>'s film is first and last an entertainment with all the appurtenances 
thereof -- humor, suspense, drama, conflict. It also offers reverberations that 
won't die down, and speculations about living in a world with and without the 
consoling, chiding idea of God. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Allen</PERSON> has come a long way from humor for its own sake to humor as the carrier 
of some very somber thoughts.

<HEAD>Diverse Collection of Nominees for Oscar's Best Actor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A boy who turns into a man. An autistic
genius. A Swedish peasant. A hard-bitten <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> agent. A dedicated math
teacher.
   Has there ever seem such a diverse collection of nominees for
best actor? Each performance seems unique, creating a difficult
choice for Academy voters.
   Gene Hackman has been in Oscar contention before. He was
nominated for supporting performances in ``Bonnie and Clyde'' (<DATE>1967</DATE>)
and ``I Never Sang for My Father'' (<DATE>1970</DATE>), and won the big prize as
the relentless <PERSON>Popeye Doyle</PERSON> in ``The French Connection'' (<DATE>1971</DATE>).
   Hackman, 58, is one of those actors who seems to get better with
age. He gets kidded about his lack of selectivity _ last year he
appeared in five films within three months _ but invariably he draws
praise from critics and his fellow actors. His one memorable film of
<DATE>1988</DATE> was ``<LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION> Burning,'' for which he was nominated.
   As the <ORGANIZATION>Southern</ORGANIZATION> sheriff turned <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> agent, Hackman once more
brought depth to what could have been a surface role. ``I always
manage to find a way in films to be a bit introspective,'' he said
in a recent magazine interview. ``It helps me as an actor, makes me
feel as if I'm doing something important.''
   <PERSON>Max Von Sydow</PERSON>'s nomination as the downtrodden farmhand in ``Pelle
the Conqueror'' was a rarity: He won the recognition speaking a
foreign language. Only one Oscar has ever been awarded to a
performer in a subtitled film: <PERSON>Sophia Loren</PERSON> for ``Two Women.''
   Although he has been acclaimed as a star of <PERSON>Ingmar Bergman</PERSON> films
and international movies, <PERSON>Von Sydow</PERSON>, 66, has had no Academy
recognition until now.
   ``I am not American and I am not English,'' he says, ``so my
choice of parts in English-language films is limited.''
   <PERSON>Von Sydow</PERSON> was delighted with his ``Pelle'' role because it
allowed him to use his own childhood dialect; like the character
Lasse, he grew up in a small Swedish town. He liked the role because
it offered ``such a great variety of emotion. In every new scene
there is a new situation and a new attitude from the man.''
   Although <PERSON>Robin Williams</PERSON> had a breakthrough nomination last year
with ``Good Morning, <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>,'' comedy has traditionally been held
in low regard by Academy voters. Now <PERSON>Tom Hanks</PERSON> is trying to break
that tradition as a nominee for ``Big.'' He made a comedic gem out
of the role of 13-year-old <PERSON>Josh Baskin</PERSON> who overnight is granted his
wish to become a grownup.
   For <PERSON>Hanks</PERSON>, 32-year-old graduate of sitcom (``Bosom Buddy''), the
role required no method-actor searching for identity. ``I just
imagined what it would be like to be a 13-year-old,'' he says simply.
   ``The kid is on the immature side,'' <PERSON>Hanks</PERSON> adds, ``and I must say
I was much the same when I was his age. It wasn't until I was 14
that I started growing up and becoming highly intelligent and
debonair.''
   Two of the other nominees for best actor faced more difficult
transformations. <PERSON>Edward James Olmos</PERSON>, the slim, laconic Lt. <PERSON>Martin
Castillo</PERSON> of TV's ``<LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> Vice,'' shaved his mustache, thinned his
hair and added 40 pounds to portray <LOCATION>East Los Angeles</LOCATION> teacher <PERSON>Jaime
Escalante</PERSON> in ``Stand and Deliver.'' The Bolivia-born Escalante
attracted wide attention by inspiring his students to such high
academic achievements that they were suspected of cheating.
   ``What motivates <PERSON>Escalante</PERSON> is the sheer love of teaching,''
observes <PERSON>Olmos</PERSON>, 42. ``When he see the light in a student's eyes,
it's a natural high, like adrenalin. He needs it, like a performer
who needs applause.''
   Olmos himself has been attracting applause since his appearance
as the macho narrator of <PERSON>Luis Valdez</PERSON>' play and the <DATE>1971</DATE> movie,
``Zoot Suit.'' His role as Lt. <PERSON>Castillo</PERSON> won him the Emmy.
   <PERSON>Dustin Hoffman</PERSON> exerted his customary thoroughness in preparing
for his role as <PERSON>Raymond Babbit</PERSON>, the autistic man with a genius for
numbers in ``Rain Man.'' After reading the initial script, he
puzzled over the paradox of a man whose autism crippled him for
normal living, but who nevertheless could perform superhuman feats
of calculation.
   For a year, <PERSON>Hoffman</PERSON> visited with autistic savants and their
families and talked with medical experts about the phenomenon. Out
of his research came the portrayal of a man who seemingly could not
converse with anyone, yet was capable of surprising flashes of
wisdom.
   <PERSON>Hoffman</PERSON>, 51, had plenty of time to prepare as ``Rain Man''
underwent changes of directors and scripts. In the first days under
director <PERSON>Barry Levinson</PERSON>, the actor remained unsatisfied. But the
pair finally reached agreement.
   ``It's like in baseball,'' he says, ``you hit a home run and then
you start popping up. What you're trying to do is just connect, meet
the ball. In the movies, you're trying to make contact. But not
until it's over do you find out where it went.''

Over in <LOCATION>Stockholm</LOCATION>, Swedish film director <PERSON>Ingmar Bergman</PERSON> is suing a tabloid for 
symbolic damages of one crown (<MONEY>15 cents</MONEY>), saying it broke the copyright to his 
memoirs. The film director and his publishers took the evening newspaper 
Aftonbladet to court this week, charging that it published an article based on 
unedited material from his biography, "<PERSON>Laterna Magica</PERSON>," before it was published

   The most delectable movie of the holiday season
is a simple little confection from <PERSON>John Hughes</PERSON> about a 10-year-old
who's left behind by accident when his parents and multitude of
siblings head off for a Christmas vacation in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>.
   ``Home Alone'' is endearing, engaging and a lot of fun, once you
suspend disbelief and buy into <PERSON>Hughes</PERSON>' idiotic premise. And one
main reason for the film's success is <PERSON>Macaulay Culkin</PERSON>, the talented
young actor who plays <PERSON>Kevin</PERSON>, the boy who finds paradise in being at
home by himself and who gets to defend the castle against all
intruders.
   Child-centered movies are popular with the younger set because
they appeal to a sense of adventure, wonderment and just plain
getting away from grown-ups. They also find an audience in those
adults who are still fortunate enough to have a streak of whimsy in
their lives.
   Some young actors put in such grand performances that the
<ORGANIZATION>Academy of Motion Picture Arts</ORGANIZATION> and Sciences honored them with Oscar
nominations. Only one, <PERSON>Tatum O'Neal</PERSON> ever won, as supporting actress
in ``Paper Moon'' in <DATE>1973</DATE>. She was 10.
   Nominees have included: <PERSON>Jackie Cooper</PERSON>, actor (``Skippy''), <DATE>1931</DATE>;

<HEAD>THE OSCARS 1990: And the Winner Is ...</HEAD>
<HEAD>Same Film Cancellation Theory Doesn't Always Work</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When two actors in the same movie are
nominated for Academy Awards, the common belief is that they will
cancel each other out.
   But it doesn't always happen. Sometimes, one wins.
   <PERSON>F. Murray Abraham</PERSON> won as best actor for ``Amadeus'' in <DATE>1984</DATE>,
although <PERSON>Tom Hulce</PERSON> was nominated for the same film.
   In recent years, there have been other winners and losers for
the same movie: <PERSON>Shirley MacLaine</PERSON> (<ORGANIZATION>Debra Winger</ORGANIZATION>) _ best actress,
``Terms of Endearment,'' <DATE>1983</DATE>; <PERSON>Jessica Lange</PERSON> (<PERSON>Teri Garr</PERSON>) _
supporting actress, ``Tootsie,'' <DATE>1982</DATE>; <PERSON>Timothy Hutton</PERSON> (<PERSON>Judd Hirsch</PERSON>)
_ supporting actor, ``Ordinary People,'' <DATE>1980</DATE>; Meryl Streep (<PERSON>Jane
Alexander</PERSON>) _ supporting actress, ``<PERSON>Kramer vs. Kramer</PERSON>,'' <DATE>1979</DATE>; <PERSON>Peter
Finch</PERSON> (<PERSON>William Holden</PERSON>) _ actor, ``Network,'' <DATE>1976</DATE>.
   The phenomenon will be tested again this year. <PERSON>Lena Olin</PERSON> and
<PERSON>Anjelica Huston</PERSON> are both nominated for supporting actress for their
roles in ``Enemies, a Love Story.''
   The two actresses offer an interesting contrast, one a member of
an American acting dynasty, the other a product of the European
theater. Huston made history in <DATE>1986</DATE>, when she became a
third-generation Oscar winner as supporting actress in ``Prizzi's
Honor.'' She had been directed by her father, <PERSON>John Huston</PERSON>, himself
an <ORGANIZATION>Academy Award</ORGANIZATION> winner as writer-director of ``The Treasure of the
Sierra Madre'' in <DATE>1948</DATE>. His father, <PERSON>Walter</PERSON>, was named best
supporting actor for the same film.
   In ``Enemies, a Love Story,'' <PERSON>Huston</PERSON> plays an <LOCATION>Auschwitz</LOCATION> survivor
who comes to <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> to confront her husband, <PERSON>Ron Silver</PERSON>. She has
described her character as ``magnificent, extremely intelligent and
honest, compassionate and yet not self-sacrificing. I loved being
able to make that statement.''
   ``She's after the truth all the time, she can't compromise, and
that's what I like about her,'' comments <PERSON>Lena Olin</PERSON> about her role.
She is another of the three wives of Silver in the <PERSON>Paul Mazursky</PERSON>
film.
   Olin was born in <LOCATION>Stockholm</LOCATION> and became a protegee of <PERSON>Ingmar
Bergman</PERSON>, for whom she acted in ``After the Rehearsal'' and ``Fanny
and Alexander.'' She first drew attention from American audiences
as the free-living photographer in ``The Unbearable Lightness of
Being.''
   Like <PERSON>Huston</PERSON>, <PERSON>Dianne Wiest</PERSON> is an Oscar winner; hers came two
years ago as supporting actress for her role in ``Hannah and Her
Sisters.'' She has been a member of the <PERSON>Woody Allen</PERSON> stock company,
having also appeared in ``The Purple Rose of <LOCATION>Cairo</LOCATION>,'' ``Radio
Days'' and ``<DATE>September</DATE>.'' Her second nomination comes for her
anguished single mother in ``Parenthood.''
   An <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> brat, <PERSON>Wiest</PERSON> lived all over the world and began acting at
the <ORGANIZATION>University of Maryland</ORGANIZATION>. She spent four years at <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>'s
<ORGANIZATION>Arena Stage Theater</ORGANIZATION>, then appeared in many <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> plays,
including ``Othello'' as <PERSON>James Earl Jones</PERSON>' Desdemona.
   <PERSON>Julia Roberts</PERSON> is the youngest of the supporting actress
nominees. The doomed daughter of <ORGANIZATION>Sally Field</ORGANIZATION> in ``Steel
Magnolias,'' she was the only performer in the all-star cast to be
recognized by the <ORGANIZATION>Academy</ORGANIZATION>. Born in <LOCATION>Smyrna</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ga.</LOCATION>, she studied acting
in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> and first drew attention in movies as a waitress in
``Mystic Pizza.''
   <PERSON>Brenda Fricker</PERSON> joined the nominees for her role as the steadfast
mother of cerebral palsy victim <PERSON>Daniel Day-Lewis</PERSON> in ``My Left
Foot.'' Previously unknown to American audiences, she is well known
as an actress in the <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> theater and the popular <ORGANIZATION>BBC</ORGANIZATION> series,
``Casualty.''
   Fricker was born and educated in <LOCATION>Dublin</LOCATION>, where ``My Left Foot''
takes place. She worked for the Irish Times newspaper before
turning to acting.

   All the World's on Stage in New York

   The lights go out in St. Bartholomew's Church on Park
Avenue. Instead of the rector mounting the pulpit, however,
blaring kettle drums puncture the silence. Suddenly, on a
stage set up in front of the altar, men in camouflage
fatigues appear and begin blasting away with automatic
weapons. It is the start of Stephen Rayne's unconventional
but intensely vibrant production of "Macbeth." Set in
modern-day Africa and by a group of black actors from the
Royal Shakespeare Company and other troupes in Britain, the
production was part of the recently concluded New York
International Festival of the Arts.
   Two years ago Martin Segal, a New York cultural mover and
shaker, put together the first International Festival. It was
a mammoth undertaking, perhaps too mammoth. The second
festival was leaner and, judging from the eight theater
events I saw from Europe, Asia and the U.S., it was
infinitely better.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Consider the two pieces by the Polish avant-garde giant
<PERSON>Tadeusz Kantor</PERSON>, presented by his company, Cricot 2, at the
<ORGANIZATION>LaMama Theater</ORGANIZATION>. Kantor died in <DATE>December</DATE>, just as he was
completing "Today Is My Birthday." Cicot 2 brought it to the
festival, along with the <PERSON>Kantor</PERSON> classic "Dead Class," which I
saw. It is a haunting series of tableaux featuring people in
black outfits with white faces sitting at a row of desks as
if in a schoolroom. They are the dead, reliving and
attempting to come to terms with their past lives.
   Also from <LOCATION>Eastern Europe</LOCATION> was the State Theater of
<LOCATION>Lithuania</LOCATION>, directed by <PERSON>Eimuntas Nekrosius</PERSON>. One of his most
celebrated productions is a highly idiosyncratic "Uncle
Vanya." It has been called a "hallucination" rather than a
straight rendering of <ORGANIZATION>Chekhov</ORGANIZATION>'s text. The servants, for
example, slide across the floor on felt shoe covers as if
they are ice skating, and the surly professor who brings
grief to all the lives around him walks with a cane and a
perpetual tilt-like a human Tower of <LOCATION>Pisa</LOCATION>.
   From <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> came "Dionysus," director <PERSON>Tadashi Suzuki</PERSON>'s
version of Euripides' "The Bacchae." In the play, Pentheus
(<PERSON>Takahisa Nishikibe</PERSON>) defies the cult of Dionysus, but
eventually is enticed to observe its orgiastic revels and is
killed by the priests of Dionysus. In <PERSON>Mr. Suzuki</PERSON>'s version
the high emotion of the story has been filtered through the
calm, stylized, measured movements of Japanese Noh and
<ORGANIZATION>Kabuki</ORGANIZATION>. Both visually and aurally, "Dionysus" is a
breathtaking example of ritualistic theater: The costumes,
the lighting, the controlled movements of the actors are
mesmerizing.
   The highlight of the festival's European offerings was
<PERSON>Ingmar Bergman</PERSON>'s three productions from the <ORGANIZATION>Royal Dramatic
Theater of Sweden</ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION>Strindberg</LOCATION>'s "Miss <PERSON>Julie</PERSON>," <PERSON>Ibsen</PERSON>'s "A
Doll's <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION>" and <PERSON>O'Neill</PERSON>'s "Long Day's Journey Into Night."
I saw the first two and both proved to be a revelation.
Without updating the plays, or resorting to other directorial
gimmicks, <PERSON>Mr. Bergman</PERSON> demonstrated that these
late-19th-century classics still reverberate with the
mysteries, the tensions, the misunderstandings of male-female
relationships.
   The female characters particularly were finely etched.
<PERSON>Lena Olin</PERSON> ("The Unbearable Lightness of Being") was a
sensual, willful, frightened <PERSON>Miss Julie</PERSON>, a count's daughter
who on <ORGANIZATION>Midsummer Eve</ORGANIZATION> becomes entangled in a fateful liaison
with her father's valet (<PERSON>Peter Stormare</PERSON>). Pernilla <PERSON>Ostergren</PERSON>
portrayed <PERSON>Nora</PERSON> in "A Doll's <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION>" with the full dimension of
her impulsive enthusiasm at the start of the play, and with a
rich, profoundly sad maturity in the final scene when she
confronts her husband (Per <PERSON>Mattsson</PERSON>). The settings for both
plays, designed by <PERSON>Gunilla Palmstierna-Weiss</PERSON>, were
semiabstract while at the same time presenting recognizable
locales.
   Among the American offerings for the festival was an
updated version of "Forbidden Broadway," the perennial spoof
of the Great White Way. As is usually the case, some skits
proved sharper and funnier than others. But all the recent
musicals -- "<PERSON>Will Rogers</PERSON>," "The Secret Garden" and "Miss
Saigon" -- came in for telling parodies. Seeing "Forbidden
Broadway" in the context of the festival underscored just how
narrow the range of Broadway offerings has become.
   A production mounted especially for the festival was
"Immigrant Voices." Audiences sailed aboard a boat past the
Statue of Liberty to <LOCATION>Ellis Island</LOCATION>. In the magnificently
restored building at which more than 16 million immigrants
were processed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, a
dozen actors, including <PERSON>Geraldine Fitzgerald</PERSON>, <PERSON>Barnard Hughes</PERSON>,
<PERSON>Helen Stenborg</PERSON> and <PERSON>Ally Sheedy</PERSON>, read excerpts from letters
and diaries of immigrants. They reflected both the unbridled
joy of those coming here and the heart-breaking
disappointment of those who were turned away -- an apt symbol
for an international festival.

SPECIAL SCREENINGS: FIRST-TIME DIRECTORS MAKE IMPRESSIVE DEBUTS AT EUROFEST

New films by such masters as <PERSON>Ermanno Olmi</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jacques Rivette</PERSON> plus impressive 
directorial debuts from <PERSON>Max Von Sydow</PERSON> and composer <PERSON>Michel Legrand</PERSON> highlight the 
sixth <ORGANIZATION>American Film Institute's European Community Festival</ORGANIZATION>, which runs <DATE>Friday</DATE> 
through <DATE>June 29</DATE> at the Fine Arts in <LOCATION>Beverly Hills</LOCATION>. As before, the overall 
quality level is higher than that of the <ORGANIZATION>AFI</ORGANIZATION>'s FilmFest, and at a time when 
markedly fewer foreign films are released, the EuroFest may be your one chance 
to see even the best of these offerings. 
</P>
<P>
Opening the festival at <TIME>6:45 p.m.</TIME> is <PERSON>Olmi</PERSON>'s "The Legend of the Holy Drinker," a 
droll, gentle fable of beguiling beauty and religious mysticism starring <PERSON>Rutger 
Hauer</PERSON>. He plays an alcoholic vagrant with a tragic secret who receives an 
unexpected blessing, yet each time he attempts to repay it he encounters 
unexpected obstacles. 
</P>
<P>
If there's no good reason beyond the obvious commercial one for this film to be 
in English -- the setting is <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>, and <PERSON>Hauer</PERSON> plays a one-time coal miner from 
<LOCATION>Silesia</LOCATION> -- at least the dialogue is easy and colloquial. <PERSON>Hauer</PERSON> has a low-key 
power, <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> never looked so enticingly sleazy and romantic and "The Legend of 
the Holy Drinker," adapted from the <PERSON>Joseph Roth</PERSON> novel, is a winner -- a literal 
one having won the Italian Oscar equivalent of Best Film, Direction and 
<ORGANIZATION>Cinematography</ORGANIZATION>. (It screens again on <DATE>Saturday</DATE> at 12 noon). 
</P>
<P>
Rivette's "The Gang of Four" (<DATE>Saturday</DATE> at 3, <DATE>Sunday</DATE> at 2) is his usual fiercely 
demanding interplay of art and life as a group of young acting students become 
caught up in the mystery and danger engulfing a former colleague and housemate. 
"The Gang of Four" on the one hand recalls <PERSON>Rivette</PERSON>'s "<LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> nous appartient" in 
its evocation of paranoia and "L'Amour fou" on the other, with the students 
finding themselves playing roles in life as well as on the stage. As long (160 
minutes) and grueling as it is, "The Gang of Four" is worth the effort, and 
<PERSON>Rivette</PERSON>'s young actresses lighten the journey with their loveliness, talent and 
individuality. The caring, detailed delineation of these young people coping 
with everyday life while ardently pursuing their dreams evokes both humor and 
compassion. Cast as the girls' exacting teacher is the exquisite Bulle Ogier, 
one of Rivette's favorite actresses. 
</P>
<P>
With the pure enchantment of "Katinka" (<DATE>Saturday</DATE> at 7), <PERSON>Max Von Sydow</PERSON> proves to 
be as skilled a director as he is an actor. This irresistible period piece, 
adapted from a novel by <PERSON>Herman Bang</PERSON> and set in rural turn-of-the-century 
<LOCATION>Norway</LOCATION>, is a beautifully told story of the love that develops between a young 
stationmaster's wife (<PERSON>Tammi Ost</PERSON>) and the handsome new manager of the largest 
estate in the area (<PERSON>Kurt Ravn</PERSON>). The past comes vividly alive in <LOCATION>Von Sydow</LOCATION>'s 
loving observation of both daily life and hearty holiday celebrations. There's 
something of <ORGANIZATION>Renoir</ORGANIZATION> and, not surprisingly, much of <PERSON>Ingmar Bergman</PERSON> in this film, 
and for all the emotions Ost and <PERSON>Ravn</PERSON> stir in us over their predicament, they 
above all earn our respect for their old-fashioned sense of honor and 
responsibility, especially in regard to <PERSON>Ost</PERSON>'s good-natured husband (<LOCATION>Ole 
Ernest</LOCATION>). 
</P>
<P>
Spanish film maker Antonio del Real's leisurely "The River That Was" (<DATE>Sunday</DATE> at 
<TIME>6 p.m.</TIME>) follows a group of loggers, headed by <PERSON>Alfredo Landa</PERSON> (star of "The Holy 
Innocents") as they guide thousands of logs down the River Tajo from Paralejos 
de las Truchas to Aranjuez. The time is <DATE>1946</DATE>, and this will be the last such 
journey before trucks are to start transporting the logs. A war-weary Irishman 
of partial Spanish descent (a reflective <PERSON>Tony Peck</PERSON>) joins the loggers, whom he 
discovers to be a hearty, honorable band of free spirits at odds with a 
corrupt, fascist society. At times the film, for all its pastoral beauty, feels 
overly long and tedious, yet there's no denying that its slow pace matches the 
tempo of a way of life it depicts with such concern. 
</P>
<P>
Also screening is "The Tall Guy" (<DATE>Friday</DATE> at 9:10), which stars <PERSON>Jeff Goldblum</PERSON> as 
an American actor in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> and which was unavailable for preview, and two 
disappointments, "Paperback Woman" (<DATE>Saturday</DATE> at 9, <DATE>Sunday</DATE> at noon) and "The 
Woman Who Dreamed" (<DATE>Sunday</DATE> at <TIME>8:30</TIME>). More about EuroFest films, including the 
<PERSON>Michel Legrand</PERSON> film, in next week's Special Screenings. For further 
information: (213) 856-7707, 652-1330.

<HEAD>At the Movies: `Crimes and Misdemeanors'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   For a decade now, <PERSON>Woody Allen</PERSON> has maintained a schizoid quality
in his films. With ``<PERSON>Broadway Danny Rose</PERSON>,'' ``The Purple Rose of
<LOCATION>Cairo</LOCATION>'' and ``<PERSON>Hannah</PERSON> and Her Sisters,'' he has presented the
familiar <PERSON>Woody Allen</PERSON>, the heroically neurotic chronicler of the
absurdities of urban living.
   ``Interiors,'' ``<DATE>September</DATE>'' and ``Another Woman,'' which <PERSON>Allen</PERSON>
wrote and directed but in which he did not appear, reflected darker
images derived from his idol, <PERSON>Ingmar Bergman</PERSON>.
   Now the twain meet in ``Crimes and Misdemeanors.'' Like all of
<PERSON>Allen</PERSON>'s movies, it is idiosyncratic, highly original and
thought-provoking. But it is unexpectedly cynical.
   Two parallel but rarely converging plots deal with different
segments of <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION> society. One is show biz. <PERSON>Allen</PERSON> is a failed
documentary maker whose devotion to esoteric subjects precludes his
success. His despairing wife, <PERSON>Jenny Gleason</PERSON>, wangles him a real
job: profiling her brother, <PERSON>Alan Alda</PERSON>, a high-powered television
producer. Allen is repelled by the crassly commercial Alda but
intrigued by his aide, <PERSON>Mia Farrow</PERSON>.
   The other plot begins with a testimonial dinner extolling the
good works of <PERSON>Martin Landau</PERSON>, a rich ophthalmologist and benefactor
with a loving wife, <PERSON>Claire Bloom</PERSON>, and family. But for two years,
<PERSON>Landau</PERSON> has had a fatal attraction to <PERSON>Anjelica Huston</PERSON>.
   When his mistress grows impatient with unkept promises, <PERSON>Landau</PERSON>
fears his comfortable world will collapse. He finds a solution
through his black-sheep brother with Mob connections, <PERSON>Jerry Orbach</PERSON>.
   ``Crimes and Misdemeanors'' climaxes at a wedding, where most of
the cast converge. There is an epilogue in which <PERSON>Landau</PERSON> returns to
his normal, untroubled life.
   Despite the murky message, the film can be enjoyed on more than
one level. <PERSON>Allen</PERSON>'s dialogue is lucid and insightful, and his
skewering of television's idiocies hits the target.
   Actors always seem to do their best work for <PERSON>Allen</PERSON>. Landau's
portrait of a good man susceptible to evil is brilliant. Alda
captures all the shrewdness and pomposity of the television breed.
<PERSON>Sam Waterston</PERSON> helps bridge the two plots as a rabbi going blind.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Orion</ORGANIZATION> release was produced by <PERSON>Robert Greenhut</PERSON> and
photographed by <PERSON>Bergman</PERSON>'s favorite <PERSON>Sven Nykvist</PERSON>. Rating: PG-13 for
adult subject matter. Running time: 104 minutes.

   Somehow, they don't seem made for each other.
   Imagine: <PERSON>Eugene O'Neill</PERSON>, <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s greatest and windiest
playwright, and television, the medium that shrank the country's
attention span.
   But director <PERSON>Jonathan Miller</PERSON>'s rapid-fire revival of <PERSON>O'Neill</PERSON>'s
``Long Day's Journey Into Night'' works better on the tube than it
did in the theater.
   The production, tonight's offering from ``American Playhouse''
on PBS, was seen on <DATE>Broadway two years ago</DATE>. It stars <PERSON>Jack Lemmon</PERSON> as
the tyrannical <PERSON>James Tyrone</PERSON> and <PERSON>Bethel Leslie</PERSON> as his drug-addled
wife <PERSON>Mary</PERSON>. Their sons are played by <PERSON>Peter Gallagher</PERSON>, who appeared
in the television movie ``The Murder of <PERSON>Mary Phagan</PERSON>,'' and <PERSON>Kevin
Spacey</PERSON>, before he turned into one of TV's more memorable villains
on ``Wiseguy.''
   Miller created quite a fuss in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> with his revved-up
version of what is considered <PERSON>O'Neill</PERSON>'s greatest and most
autobiographical play. By overlapping dialogue and a little
cutting, <PERSON>Miller</PERSON> slashed the running time from four hours to three.
   ``The real topic of the play is a series of tellings and
listenings, of tellings and half-listenings, of tellings and
failing to listen,'' <PERSON>Miller</PERSON> said in an interview with the British
theater magazine Plays and Players.
   Everyone talks in ``Long Day's Journey Into Night,'' which takes
place over one long <DATE>summer</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> in <DATE>1912</DATE>, and the conversations are
acrimonious, self-serving and ultimately heart-breaking.
   <PERSON>James Tyrone</PERSON> is a vainglorious husband and father. Mary is a
defeated woman, taking refuge in morphine. Her older son, <PERSON>Jamey</PERSON>, a
half-hearted actor, finds his solace in liquor, while the younger
boy, <PERSON>Edmund</PERSON>, a would-be writer modeled after <PERSON>O'Neill</PERSON> himself, finds
his career threated by tuberculosis. They blame each other, never
themselves.
   In the theater, the simultaneous conversations turned to mush.
On television, close-ups keep the audience in touch.
   Lemmon and <PERSON>Miss Leslie</PERSON> are more successful on the small screen,
too, revealing depths that were missing from their theater
performances. Lemmon captures the preening, self-centered qualities
that destroy <PERSON>Tyrone</PERSON>'s wife and turn his sons against him. If the
ultimate tragedy eludes him, he gives the character a degree of
credibility.
   Miss <PERSON>Leslie</PERSON> is a surprise. She seemed strangely muted on stage,
unable to project the unbearable sadness of a woman overwhelmed by
life. That desperation comes across in the television version and
even acquires a delicate, other- worldly character.
   Spacey and <PERSON>Gallagher</PERSON> were the strongest actors on stage and
their strengths still are evident here. Spacey is particularly
moving as the bitter son who realizes he has failed and can do
nothing about it.
   This year is the centennial of <PERSON>O'Neill</PERSON>'s birth and ``Long Day's
Journey Into Night'' will be very much a part of worldwide
festivities. A revival directed by <PERSON>Ingmar Bergman</PERSON> just opened in
<LOCATION>Stockholm</LOCATION> to rave reviews.
   <PERSON>Jason Robards</PERSON> and <PERSON>Colleen Dewhurst</PERSON> will star in a revival this
<DATE>summer</DATE> on Broadway directed by <PERSON>Jose Quintero</PERSON>.
   The Broadway production and cast will alternate performances
with ``Ah, Wilderness!,'' <PERSON>O'Neill</PERSON>'s only comedy.
   ``Ah, Wilderness!'' represents a sunny, innocent family life
that <PERSON>O'Neill</PERSON> wished for but never found. ``Long Day's Journey'' was
the other side of his psyche. Miller's television production
explores it with uncommon and unnerving grace.

If <LOCATION>Plymouth</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Stephen Sondheim</PERSON> is less appealing than <ORGANIZATION>Leicester</ORGANIZATION>'s, the fact
is that A <ORGANIZATION>Little Night Music</ORGANIZATION> is in itself a less enticing proposition than
Merrily We Roll Along. It came some nine years earlier in the <PERSON>Sondheim</PERSON>
oeuvre, and the idea of setting <PERSON>Ingmar Bergman</PERSON>'s romantic film-comedy Smiles
of a <ORGANIZATION>Summer Night</ORGANIZATION> to waltz-time got a brittle realisation, one that needs
all the stage help it can get.
<PERSON>Roger Redfarn</PERSON>'s <LOCATION>Plymouth</LOCATION> production has its merits. There are pretty sets by
<PERSON>Martyn Bainbridge</PERSON>: a decayed proscenium arch, trellises, a large mock-rococo
fresco, shadowy trees outside <LOCATION>Grandmamma</LOCATION>'s chateau (far too many bright
stars, though, for a midnight-sun night). Reduced to two pianos and a cello,
all commendably expert, the score sounds brittler than ever - pastiche
operetta, even G&amp;S, with ingenious rhymes over mildly queasy
waltz-harmonies. One misses the original string ensemble. The one surefire
number, 'Send in the Clowns', comes near the end; there is nothing so
memorably apt and infectious as 'Old Friends', midstream in Merrily We Roll
Along.
The real trouble, however, lies with the adaptation (by <PERSON>Hugh Wheeler</PERSON> and
<PERSON>Sondheim</PERSON>). In <PERSON>Bergman</PERSON>'s comedy, quite naturalistic and slightly cruel, a
weary, unglamorous lawyer, with a still-virgin bride of 11 months, competed
with an icily formidable Count for the favours of a famous actress (the
irreplaceable <PERSON>Eva Dahlbeck</PERSON>). In the musical the Count is only a blustering
dunderhead and the equally icy Countess a lachrymose Wronged Wife; the
lawyer becomes a mature romantic hero - attractively played here by <PERSON>Gary
Raymond</PERSON>, sung at variable pitch.
<PERSON>Rula Lenska</PERSON> puts a credible face on the actress, and <PERSON>Richard Lyndon</PERSON> and
<PERSON>Deborah Grant</PERSON> do their best for the sadly declasse aristos, but the tense
class-divisions go for nothing, leaving the story lamed. Worse, for Broadway
the ultra-dignified Grandmamma - once a famous courtesan - was turned into a
raunchy old dame, a coarse Lady Bracknell. Though <PERSON>Hermione Gingold</PERSON> just
about got away with it, this gross cartoon lies well outside <PERSON>Eileen Page</PERSON>'s
more delicate range.
<PERSON>Kate Arneil</PERSON>'s lusty maid is fetching, and <PERSON>Dermot McLaughlin</PERSON> makes something
of his under-written role as the lawyer's greenstick son (piety sabotaged by
rampant adolescence). The child-bride is <PERSON>Lisa Hollander</PERSON>, who sings and
smiles charmingly, and delivers each new line as if it had nothing to do
with her last one.
