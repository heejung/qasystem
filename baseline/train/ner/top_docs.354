TINY worms which kill insect pests have won a joint environmental
achievement award for <ORGANIZATION>Agricultural Genetics Company</ORGANIZATION>, an independent
biotechnology company based in <LOCATION>Cambridge</LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION>Horticulture Research
International</ORGANIZATION>, the state-backed agency responsible for fruit and vegetable
research, writes <PERSON>Clive Cookson</PERSON>.
AGC's MicroBio subsidiary has been working for six years with <ORGANIZATION>HRI</ORGANIZATION>'s
<LOCATION>Littlehampton</LOCATION> research station in <LOCATION>Sussex</LOCATION> to develop natural pesticides based
on nematode worms. The first two products were launched in 1989/90: Nemasys
against glasshouse sciarids and Nemasys H against vine weevils. Both insects
are important horticultural pests, particularly of nursery stock.
The Nemasys products are in the forefront of what is likely to be a huge
wave of biopesticides introduced over the next decade. Their environmental
advantage is that, unlike synthetic chemical pesticides, they do not leave
harmful residues in crops and water supplies.
Worldwide sales of biological pesticides were worth about Dollars 120m last
year - only 2 per cent of the figure for chemical pesticides. Industry
predictions put the biopesticide market in <DATE>2000</DATE> in the Dollars 500m to
Dollars 2bn region.
So far the emerging market has been dominated by products based on Bacillus
thuringiensis, a naturally occurring bacterium that makes an insect-killing
toxin. The AGC-HRI partnership has lead the way on nematode-based
insecticides, though a Californian company, <ORGANIZATION>Biosys</ORGANIZATION>, is about to launch a
competitive product.
The achievement of <ORGANIZATION>AGC</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>HRI</ORGANIZATION> researchers has been to identify nematode
strains with specific activity against their target pests and then develop a
technique for mass-producing the microscopic worms by large-scale
fermentation.
Nemasys is sold in packs, each containing at least 50m juvenile worms in a
moist, inert carrier which is applied to the compost or soil around the
plants. There the nematodes seek out and kill insect larvae (to be precise,
the actual killing is done by symbiotic bacteria that live inside the
worms). The nematodes reproduce inside the dead insect as it decomposes and
release a new generation of juveniles which move off into the compost in
search of more prey.
The next target for the AGC-HRI nematodes will be the flies that feed off
cultivated mushrooms, the most valuable horticultural crop in the <ORGANIZATION>UK</ORGANIZATION>. A new
Nemasys product is being introduced this year for biological control of
sciarid flies in mushrooms. If it is adopted instead of chemical
insecticides, it will remove the environmental problem of disposing of
650,000 tonnes a year of spent pesticide-laden mushroom compost.
AGC is also working with the Agriculture and <ORGANIZATION>Food Research Council's Long
Ashton Research Station</ORGANIZATION> to develop biopesticides to control slugs and
snails.
Production of the slug control nematode has reached the pilot plant stage
and it is expected to reach the market in two to three years, after
extensive field trials.
'We are confident that our natural product will be as effective as chemical
control methods at a competitive cost to users,' says <PERSON>Peter Innes</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>AGC
MicroBio</ORGANIZATION> director.

<HEAD>Miscroscopic Worm May Help Curb Crop Pest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of the costliest crop pests of farmers and
home gardeners may one day be curbed by a natural enemy, a
microscopic killer worm that searches the soil for the corn
rootworm, the <ORGANIZATION>Agriculture Department</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>Monday</DATE>.
   The tiny worm, or nematode, is called Steinernema feltiae. After
infecting the rootworm, the nematode releases a bacterium that
kills the pest. Then, said <ORGANIZATION>USDA</ORGANIZATION> entomologist <PERSON>Jan J. Jackson</PERSON>, the
nematode uses the larva's body as a place to reproduce while it
feasts on bacteria and larva tissue.
   About 10 days later, hundreds of new nematodes emerge and start
searching for more rootworms.
   ``That gives you an advantage over chemical controls,'' he said
in a report by the department's <ORGANIZATION>Agricultural Research Service</ORGANIZATION>. ``A
chemical just sits there and waits for the rootworm to come to it.
The nematode doesn't wait.''
   But <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON> found that the nematodes don't persist in the ground
long enough to eliminate a rootworm infestation. In one field trial
where he works at the department's <ORGANIZATION>Northern Grain Insects Research
Laboratory</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Brookings</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>S.D.</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON> applied 100,000 nematodes to
the base of each of several corn plants, reducing rootworm damage
by 11 percent
   <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON> said that is not an acceptable level of control, but he
expects further research could lead to protection as good as from
chemical insecticides. A separate test with a chemical reduced root
damage by <PERCENT>44 percent</PERCENT>.
   Rootworm larvae destroy corn roots, and adults feed on the
leaves, tassels and ears. <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON> said <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> corn producers spend
nearly <MONEY>$350 million</MONEY> a year to fight the rootworms. Nematodes
probably could be produced at about the same cost, without the risk
of chemical injury to farmers and the environment.

<HL> TECHNOLOGY:
Bug-Eating Nematodes Hold
Promise as Natural Pesticide

<TEXT>
   BIOCONTROL, THE USE of naturally occurring organisms to combat agricultural pests, has been touted for years as an alternative to chemical pesticides. 
But to date, only a few of the products have been commercially feasible, and their uses are limited. 
As in many other areas of technology, the advances needed to commercialize innovations in biocontrol have come in grinding, small steps, rather than blinding breakthroughs. 

   So it is with the lowly nematode. 
Scientists have long known that while most varieties of this microscopic underground worm harm many major crops, a handful of nematode strains vigorously attack other underground pests and are innocuous to humans and plants. 
The helpful nematodes, however, aren't naturally plentiful enough to make much inroad against farm pests. 
And until the worms can be produced and applied in large quantities, they will be too expensive to compete with chemical pesticides. 

   Biosis, a <LOCATION>Palo Alto</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, biotechnology company, is using both low and high technology in trying to hurdle these barriers. 
It has developed a stinking broth of enzymes and ground-up pig kidneys that fosters the nematodes in great abundance and at less expense than previous efforts to mass produce the worms. 
Biosis is propagating the worms by the billions in stoppered three-foot plastic tubes about six inches in diameter. 

   But the nematodes are voracious bug killers only during their juvenile life cycle. 
Biosis found a low-cost way to ensure that all the nematodes are at that stage: It runs them through detergent in a <ORGANIZATION>Whirlpool</ORGANIZATION> washing machine, and the detergent kills all forms of the bug except the durable juveniles. 

   Biosis also faced another major hurdle: how to package the worms in large quantities that can easily be transported, stored and applied. 
Although the worms can be kept in liquid, the containers have to be aerated. 
Instead, <PERSON>Biosis</PERSON> took an opposite tack that is simpler and less expensive -- it dries the worms and stores them in a state of suspended animation. 
To use the nematodes, farmers will only have to drop a pack of dried worms into a sprayer, add water to revive the organisms, and apply to fields or orchards. 
The nematodes then sift through the soil, seeking out and dining on subterranean bugs, including such farm pests as the root-weevil, termite and <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION> potato beetle. 
The worms feed on about 200 types of insects. 

   COMMERCIAL SUCCESS isn't assured, of course. 
One remaining giant step, fraught with problems, is to increase production to huge 40,000-liter tanks in a <MONEY>$15 million</MONEY>, high-volume plant that Biosis plans to build soon. 
Moreover, nematodes so far can only be used for underground pests or in a moist above-ground environment. 
Field tests, however, have shown enough promise to attract <ORGANIZATION>Chevron Corp.</ORGANIZATION>'s chemical unit and <ORGANIZATION>Chemlawn Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, the lawn-care unit of <ORGANIZATION>St. Paul, Minn.-based Ecolab Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, as research partners. 

   "It's just a question of time and money" before strains that work above-ground are developed, says Biosis president <PERSON>Albert J. Morris</PERSON>. 
Biosis already has committed <MONEY>$10 million</MONEY> to research and development. 
Field tests show that on certain crops the special nematodes work as well as chemical pesticides, <PERSON>Mr. Morris</PERSON> says. 
Biosis plans to begin commercial sales next year, initially focusing on high-value crops such as almonds and artichokes. 
As production costs drop, the company expects to expand its market to include control of termites, cockroaches, and a host of field and garden pests. 
"We'll be cost-competitive (with chemical pesticides) within the next few years" for a half-dozen types of crops, <PERSON>Mr. Morris</PERSON> says. 

   Laser May Aid Gene Altering in Grains 

   Scientists have long been stymied in their efforts to create superior new strains of commercial grains by artificially introducing foreign genetic material. 
But a laser-based gene-insertion technique developed at the <ORGANIZATION>University of California</ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION>Irvine</LOCATION> may help solve the problem. 

   For years, scientists have tried in vain to manipulate the genetic makeup of grain plants such as corn and wheat. 
Such a DNA transfer, now fairly common in animal cells and in other plants, is a prerequisite to genetically engineering better-yielding grains. 

   To insert different DNA into an animal cell, scientists soften its outer membrane with solvents, then expose it to a specially engineered virus that penetrates the cell and carries the new genes in with it. 
For broadleaf plants such as tomatoes or tobacco, a similar procedure is applied, using bacteria instead of a virus. 
But scientists have been unable to find a similar "vector" to smuggle new genetic material into the cells of grain plants. 

   THE <LOCATION>IRVINE</LOCATION> RESEARCHERS have come up with a method they think could help. 
After suspending the target cells in a liquid that contains the DNA to be introduced, the researchers manipulate individual cells into the cross hairs of a microscope-mounted laser. 
When the cell comes into target, it is zapped with the tiny beam for a fraction of a second. 
Before the neat, self-sealing hole closes, the new DNA flows in, says <PERSON>Michael Berns</PERSON>, director of the university's <ORGANIZATION>Beckman Laser Institute and Medical Clinic</ORGANIZATION>. 
He says the process has been successfully tested on animal cells. 
Whether it can work with the thick cell walls of grain plants remains to be seen, although preliminary work has been promising, he says.

<HEAD>Absorbent Material Helps To Counter Citrus Root Weevils</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An absorbent material called super slurper is
helping tiny worms to kill root weevils that threaten citrus trees,
the <ORGANIZATION>Agriculture Department</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
   <PERSON>William J. Schroeder</PERSON>, an entomolgist in the department's
<ORGANIZATION>Agricultural Research Service</ORGANIZATION>, said the super slurper keeps soil
moist so that the microscopic worms, or nematodes, can survive and
kill weevils which chew the tree roots.
   In tests, <PERCENT>60 percent</PERCENT> of the weevils were killed, compared with
only <PERCENT>25 percent</PERCENT> without the help of the worms. <PERSON>Schroeder</PERSON> said that
weevils can kill up to <PERCENT>30 percent</PERCENT> of the trees in a grove if not
controlled.
   The nematodes haven't been used before as a natural weevil
control because they die quickly if soil dries out, <PERSON>Schoeder</PERSON> said.
   Other agency scientists are looking into the use of super
slurper and nematodes to see if they can control pests of corn and
vegetables.
   Agency scientists in <LOCATION>Peoria</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ill.</LOCATION>, invented the cornstarch-based
super slurper 14 years ago. It has been successfully used in dozens
of commercial products, including body powder, medical dressings
and many other items.
   <PERSON>Schroeder</PERSON>, who works at the department's horticultural research
laboratory in <LOCATION>Orlando</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla.</LOCATION>, said he thought of super slurper in
<DATE>1985</DATE> when he observed nematodes dying in dry soil.
   Companies could mass-produce nematodes and ``package billions of
them alive'' for sale to growers, who then could mix the worms with
super slurper for application on tree roots before planting, he
said.
   For citrus groves already inhabited by the beneficial nematodes,
<PERSON>Schroeder</PERSON> said he is looking into the possibility of injecting
super slurper into the soil with a nozzle.
   The tiny worms, which survive as long as the soil is kept moist,
penetrate the weevils and release lethal bacteria, which don't harm
plants or other organisms, <PERSON>Schroeder</PERSON> said.

Shipping large numbers of beneficial nematodes from one place to another is a
major obstacle to widespread use, <PERSON>Lindegren</PERSON> said.;    The nematodes are dried
by dunking them in a solution that contains less water than there is inside
the nematodes. Once the nematodes are properly dried, the solution is filtered
off. The resulting paste of now very flat worms can be refrigerated in
containers at about 45 degrees for up to 35 days.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>
   Insect pests could be quickly and safely
killed by enticing them to eat a gelatinous meal containing
parasites, a biologist says.
   Such ``biogel'' pesticides can't harm plants, animals or the
environment, but kill beetles, termites, cockroaches, boll weevils,
corn rootworms, tobacco worms and other insects within days, said
<PERSON>Frank Chang</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Temple University</ORGANIZATION> biology professor who developed it
with graduate student <PERSON>Michael Gehret</PERSON>.
   ``Biogel'' is a soft material that contains an insect
attractant, a feeding stimulant, food and nematodes _ insects'
natural enemies, <PERSON>Chang</PERSON> said. Nematodes live naturally in the soil
and farmers, to control pests, spray them in large quantities in
fields, a process <PERSON>Chang</PERSON> said is generally inefficient.
   ``The nematodes can be rendered harmless by lack of moisture,
ultraviolet light, and heat. It is most likely that many nematodes
die before killing any insects. At the same time, insects are able
somehow to detect the meatodes, and the pests will often avoid
these supersaturated areas.''
   By contrast, ``biogel'' placed in small containers attracts
insects while preventing detection of the nematodes. ``Biogel
reduces the use of nematodes by <PERCENT>99 percent</PERCENT>,'' <PERSON>Chang</PERSON> said. ``In
other words, instead of spraying 10 million nematodes per 225
square feet of soil, you only need 100,000.
   ``As the nematodes produce offspring in the remains of each
insect, the progeny return to the soil to repeat the infectious
cycle.''
   He estimated that corn farmers who spend an estimated <MONEY>$10</MONEY> an
acre for chemicals to control rootworms could halve their costs.
   <PERSON>Ray McAllister</PERSON>, director of regulatory affairs for the
Washington-based <ORGANIZATION>National Agricultural Chemicals Association</ORGANIZATION>, said
<PERSON>Chang</PERSON>'s work ``makes dramatic promises. As with all new products,
it must prove itself in the marketplace against some stiff
competition. ...
   ``It has potential, but it is not the cure-all and it is
certainly not the replacement for pesticides.''
   Attempts at biological control predate chemical pest control
strategies and often have had good results, he said, but they tend
to be specific to one pest rather than the variety that attack
crops.

   The X-rays, in addition to sharp-nosed canine sniffers, will be

<HEAD>Lamb Production Expands For Second Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lamb production is at a seasonal peak because
of this year's earlier religious holidays and will ease down
somewhat in the next few months, says an <ORGANIZATION>Agriculture Department</ORGANIZATION>
report.
   With Easter and Passover coming up this <DATE>weekend</DATE>, lamb production
in the <DATE>first quarter</DATE> may reach about 80 million pounds and then
drop back to around <MONEY>78 million pounds</MONEY> in the <DATE>second quarter</DATE>,
according to the department's <ORGANIZATION>Economic Research Service</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``Lambs on feed (for the slaughter market) were up <PERCENT>18 percent</PERCENT> on
<DATE>Jan. 1, 1988</DATE>,'' the report said. ``These supplies should be
available during the first half of the year and could push
production up about <PERCENT>6 percent</PERCENT>.''
   Lamb and mutton take a far-back seat with American consumers but
are still an important part of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> food and agricultural
sector. This year, for example, per capita consumption may be about
1.4 pounds, compared with an average of around 83 pounds of
poultry, 72 pounds of beef, 63 pounds of pork and 1.5 pounds of
veal.
   The <DATE>Jan. 1</DATE> inventory of all sheep and lambs in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>
rose <PERCENT>4 percent</PERCENT> from a year earlier to 10.8 million head, which
agency economists said represented ``the second year of expansion
following several years of profitability'' in the sheep business.
   ``The West showed the biggest increases in the ewe flock, about
<PERCENT>6 percent</PERCENT> above a year ago,'' they said in the <DATE>April</DATE> issue of
Agricultural Outlook magazine. ``In the <LOCATION>Great Plains</LOCATION>, sheep
inventories increased a little over <PERCENT>2 percent</PERCENT> from a year ago. Most
of this expansion occurred outside of <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, which has the largest
inventory of any state.''
   Analysts said they were surprised by a decline in the sheep and
lamb inventory east of the <LOCATION>Rocky Mountains</LOCATION>, including a <PERCENT>4 percent</PERCENT>
drop in the <LOCATION>North Central</LOCATION> states. The Southeast was down <PERCENT>5 percent</PERCENT>
on <DATE>Jan. 1</DATE> after a <PERCENT>12 percent</PERCENT> increase a year earlier.
   But the declines in the inventories were not sharp enough to
offset larger numbers elsewhere, which the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Great

   Lamb production is at a seasonal peak because
of this year's earlier religious holidays and will ease down
somewhat in the next few months, says an <ORGANIZATION>Agriculture Department</ORGANIZATION>
report.
   With Easter and Passover coming up this <DATE>weekend</DATE>, lamb production
in the <DATE>first quarter</DATE> may reach about 80 million pounds and then
drop back to around <MONEY>78 million pounds</MONEY> in the <DATE>second quarter</DATE>,
according to the department's <ORGANIZATION>Economic Research Service</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``Lambs on feed (for the slaughter market) were up <PERCENT>18 percent</PERCENT> on
<DATE>Jan. 1, 1988</DATE>,'' the report said. ``These supplies should be
available during the first half of the year and could push
production up about <PERCENT>6 percent</PERCENT>.''
   Lamb and mutton take a far-back seat with American consumers but
are still an important part of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> food and agricultural
sector. This year, for example, per capita consumption may be about
1.4 pounds, compared with an average of around 83 pounds of
poultry, 72 pounds of beef, 63 pounds of pork and 1.5 pounds of
veal.
   The <DATE>Jan. 1</DATE> inventory of all sheep and lambs in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>
rose <PERCENT>4 percent</PERCENT> from a year earlier to 10.8 million head, which
agency economists said represented ``the second year of expansion
following several years of profitability'' in the sheep business.
   ``The West showed the biggest increases in the ewe flock, about
<PERCENT>6 percent</PERCENT> above a year ago,'' they said in the <DATE>April</DATE> issue of
Agricultural Outlook magazine. ``In the <LOCATION>Great Plains</LOCATION>, sheep
inventories increased a little over <PERCENT>2 percent</PERCENT> from a year ago. Most
of this expansion occurred outside of <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, which has the largest
inventory of any state.''
   Analysts said they were surprised by a decline in the sheep and
lamb inventory east of the <LOCATION>Rocky Mountains</LOCATION>, including a <PERCENT>4 percent</PERCENT>
drop in the <LOCATION>North Central</LOCATION> states. The Southeast was down <PERCENT>5 percent</PERCENT>
on <DATE>Jan. 1</DATE> after a <PERCENT>12 percent</PERCENT> increase a year earlier.
   But the declines in the inventories were not sharp enough to
offset larger numbers elsewhere, which the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Great

"But why are you pouring worms on the lawn?" asked my wife from a great 
distance, as I was trying to describe what nematodes are. One of the more 
fascinating of the new organic controls employs tiny (make that microscopic) 
worm-like nematodes that find, attack and kill larvae living underground, or 
close to the ground, such as cutworms, root maggots, wireworms, the 
helmet-headed larva of <DATE>June</DATE> beetles (which chomp on lawn grass roots and which 
were my intended target) and a host of other creatures that attack vegetables, 
flowers and lawns. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Biosys</ORGANIZATION>, a biological pest control company in <LOCATION>Palo Alto</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> makes this 
product, called <ORGANIZATION>BioSafe Lawn</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Garden Insect Control</ORGANIZATION>. What you get in the 
large box is a plastic bottle with what looks like window screening inside, 
plus a package of "activator." 
</P>
<P>
The screening is coated with a gel that contains the dormant nematodes (which 
can be stored refrigerated for up to six months). You add water and the 
activator to release the nematodes and then put this mixture is a watering can 
or hose-end sprayer and apply it to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Each box contains enough of the little creatures (probably billions) to treat 
an area 22.5 feet by 10 feet, or 225 square feet. Because it is not a poison, 
it is not harmful to the environment, people or pets. It is not yet commonly 
available at nurseries but is becoming available. Scanmask is a similar 
nematode product available through the mail, from Ringer, <LOCATION>9959 Valley View 
Road</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Eden Prairie</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Minn.</LOCATION>, 55344-3585, (800) 654-1047. One pint sells for 
<MONEY>$14.98</MONEY>. It treats 200 to 370 square feet depending on pest type. ROBERT SMAUS

<HEAD>Government To Send `Dear Farmer Jones' Letters To Late Borrowers</HEAD>

   About 90,000 farmers who are behind in their
loan repayments to the <ORGANIZATION>Farmers Home Administration</ORGANIZATION> will be getting
notices shortly after the <DATE>Nov. 8</DATE> election telling them to start
making arrangements for settlement.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Agriculture Department</ORGANIZATION> agency said <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> the notices will
be an attempt to collect about <MONEY>$8.8 billion</MONEY> in past-due loans.
   Spokesman <PERSON>Marlyn Aycock</PERSON> said rules implementing new credit
legislation will take effect <DATE>Nov. 14</DATE> and that ``Dear Farmer Jones''
notices will start going out soon thereafter to the delinquent FmHA
borrowers.
   <PERSON>Aycock</PERSON> said the notices will say: ``This is to inform you that
you're seriously behind in your loan payments and to inform you of
your options. Farmers who are more than 180 days late in making
payments have several options.''
   The notices will explain that the <ORGANIZATION>FmHA</ORGANIZATION> borrowers must notify the
agency within 45 days if they intend to apply to make arrangements
for settling their debts. Details regarding the options, including
debt restructuring and write-offs, also will be provided.
   <PERSON>Aycock</PERSON> said the timetable for sending out the notices as promptly
as possible took into consideration the months of rulemaking,
periods for public comment and time for training <ORGANIZATION>FmHA</ORGANIZATION> people to
handle the additional job load.
   <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> ordered <ORGANIZATION>FmHA</ORGANIZATION> to revise its lending practices in the
Agricultural Credit Act of <DATE>1987</DATE>. The agency is often called the farm
lender of last resort because it makes loans only to those who
cannot qualify at banks or other commercial sources.
   The debt write-down, or forgiveness provision, is regarded as one
of the most important parts of the <DATE>1987</DATE> law. It allows <ORGANIZATION>FmHA</ORGANIZATION> to
reduce a farmer's delinquent debt to the recovery value of the
collateral, which is usually land or farm equipment, depending on
cash flow and other factors.
   Also, as the result of lawsuits, the <ORGANIZATION>FmHA</ORGANIZATION> is under court order to
redo many of its loan regulations and to hold up on foreclosures and
forced liquidations until those actions are completed.
   Estimates of the extent of <ORGANIZATION>FmHA</ORGANIZATION> loan delinquencies and numbers of
farmers potentially threatened by foreclosure under the new rules
have varied.
   Last <DATE>May 23</DATE>, when the new regulations were proposed, <ORGANIZATION>FmHA</ORGANIZATION> losses
resulting from write-offs and other settlements were estimated at
about <MONEY>$8.7 billion</MONEY> and that about 118,000 borrowers were delinquent.
About 64,800 of those could be pushed into liquidation or
foreclosure because they couldn't qualify for help under the new law.
   Another major step was an interim rule announced on <DATE>Sept. 14</DATE>,
including procedures for making debt restructuring and write-downs.
Those were to take effect on <DATE>Oct. 14</DATE> on an interim basis and called
for final adoption on <DATE>Nov. 14</DATE> after a 60-day period for public
comments.
   In the <DATE>September</DATE> announcement, the earlier analysis was used
again which referred to 118,000 delinquent borrowers, including
about 65,000 who would be rejected for debt write-downs. The
potential losses were said to be as high as <MONEY>$9.4 billion</MONEY>, although
about <MONEY>$1 billion</MONEY> could be salvaged by the agency.
   <PERSON>Aycock</PERSON> said the current estimate of 90,000 delinquent borrowers
was based on figures <DATE>last fall</DATE>, when FmHA delinquencies are
historically lower than those in <DATE>January</DATE>, when the 118,000 were
reported.

<HEAD>Spread Of Fire Ants Not Likely To Be Checked, Researcher Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Farmers and homeowners should probably just
learn to live with fire ants, says a researcher who has been
unsuccessful at stopping the imported pests whose sting sends
21,000 Americans a year to doctors.
   ``With today's technology, there's nothing out there that'll
eradicate them,'' said <PERSON>Stan Diffie</PERSON>, a researcher at the <ORGANIZATION>University
of Georgia's Coastal Plain Experiment Station</ORGANIZATION>. ``We can control
them, but we can't eradicate them.''
   Diffie and entomologist <PERSON>Craig Sheppard</PERSON> are evaluating chemical
and biological controls for the South American insect believed to
have entered the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> in Mobile, <LOCATION>Ala.</LOCATION>, about 60 years ago.
Since then, fire ants have spread to 270 million acres in the
<LOCATION>Carolinas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION>.
   Fire ants reproduce quickly and spread rapidly. In <LOCATION>south
Georgia</LOCATION>, it's not uncommon to find 40 mounds per acre, which isn't
a problem in pastures, but in fields where machinery is used ``you
would have a problem,'' <PERSON>Diffie</PERSON> said.
   ``They're a nuisance _ a people pest, whether it's unsightliness
in your yards or stinging your kids,'' said <PERSON>Diffie</PERSON>. The ants'
painful stings force at least 21,000 people to seek medical
treatment each year, according to a survey of physicians in 13
states for the <ORGANIZATION>American Academy of Allergy</ORGANIZATION> and Immunology.
   Nearly <PERCENT>40 percent</PERCENT> of those treated were in <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, according to
the survey, and <PERCENT>20 percent</PERCENT> were in <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>. Thirty-two people died
from stings last year, mostly people especially sensitive to the
toxin and bitten more than once.
   ``People and physicians should take these stings seriously,''
said <PERSON>Dr. Robert Rhoades</PERSON>, a pediatrician at the <ORGANIZATION>Medical College of
Georgia</ORGANIZATION> who monitors medical problems caused by fire ants. People
allergic to other kinds of insect stings should be especially
cautious. The stings cause a burning sensation, usually followed by
formation of pus around the site within 24 hours.
   But fire ants also help farmers by attacking pests such as
ticks, worms and other insects that damage sugar cane, cotton and
pecans. Up to 250,000 ants can live in each mound, which can extend
up to six feet in the soil.
   ``They'll eat anything that's dead. You have to have something
out there to clean up the carcasses,'' <PERSON>Diffie</PERSON> said.
   In the search for effective controls, <PERSON>Diffie</PERSON> has studied baits,
pesticides and natural enemies such as nematodes and mites. He
makes bait from corn grits soaked with soybean oil and poison. The
bait, scattered on pastures and fields, is carried into fire ant
mounds and kills ants that consume the mixture.
   Only a few ants in each colony are capable of reproduction.
Fertile males and females have wings and mate in flight. Then the
males die and the females establish new colonies. ``You have got to
kill the queen,'' <PERSON>Diffie</PERSON> said. ``If you don't, she'll just keep
laying eggs.''
   Common pesticides can kill fire ants, but don't remain active
long enough in the soil to be a long-term solution, he said. ``It
would be nice if we could put them where we want them _ get them
out of the yard and put them in the pecan orchards and sugar cane
fields. But I'd rather see them gone altogether. If we didn't have
them, we'd find ways to control the other pests.''
   Concern about the environmental hazards has led researchers to
look for biological controls, including microscopic worms known as
nematodes, and straw-itch mites, which are a natural enemy of fire
ants.
   ``Nematodes were mixed in water and poured over a fire ant
mound. About 2 million nematodes could be mixed in two gallons of
water,'' <PERSON>Diffie</PERSON> said. Those tests weren't considered very
successful because only about <PERCENT>37 percent</PERCENT> of the colonies treated
with nematodes were destroyed.
   Mites were ``fairly successful,'' he said, ``But the cost is
prohibitive as treatments are <MONEY>$5</MONEY> per mound and two treatments are
necessary.''

   Scientists at Mycogen Corp. said they have discovered new
strains of a bacterium that could greatly broaden the use of
biological insecticides against pests around the home and on
farms.
   The discovery was of new strains of the common soil
bacterium, Bacillus thuringiensis, or simply B.t. Poisons or
toxins produced by B.t. bacteria are the subject of much
research in pest control because, unlike the synthetic
chemicals they aim to replace, they are harmless to humans
and other animals. Until now, however, the natural B.t.
toxins that have been found have been effective against only
a narrow range of agricultural pests, mainly caterpillars.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The <ORGANIZATION>Mycogen</ORGANIZATION> researchers, in a study published in the
latest issue of the journal Bio/Technology, said they have
isolated B.t. strains that produce toxins that kill such
diverse organisms as amoeba, mites, flatworms, fleas, adult
houseflies, nematodes, snails and slugs.
   Researchers at the <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, company predicted
their discovery could lead to the development of a pest
control system totally based on the naturally occurring
toxins and could change the fledgling biopesticide industry.
The finding also might lead to medicines that can be targeted
against specific unwanted organisms in humans and animals,
they said.
   "It was beyond most peoples' wildest dreams to get (a
pesticide system that attacked) such a significant portion of
the million species of insects, the more than 100,000 types
of nematodes, the tens of thousands of flatworms, and the
tens of thousands of protozoans," said <PERSON>Leo Kim</PERSON>, executive
vice president of research at <ORGANIZATION>Mycogen</ORGANIZATION>.
   Pesticides made from the B.t. toxins currently account for
<MONEY>$107 million</MONEY> in sales in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, and until now the industry
was counting on sales of <MONEY>$300 million</MONEY> by <DATE>1999</DATE>. With the new
finding "I expect the sales to be substantially more than
that," the executive said.
   G. <PERSON>Steven Burrill</PERSON>, who follows biotechnology at <ORGANIZATION>Ernst &amp;
Young</ORGANIZATION>, however, cautioned against excessive enthusiasm. He
said the new B.t. strains will have "a dramatic impact" on
biopesticide sales but "it is a long way between discovery
and sales." He said any new product will have to go through
the federal regulatory maze, which, based on the past
experience, hasn't been all that quick in giving its approval
for commercial sale for such products.
   <ORGANIZATION>Mycogen</ORGANIZATION> manufactures a variety of crop protection products
based on the B.t. gene that produces the toxin. Last year it
received <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Environmental Protection Agency</ORGANIZATION> approval for
two genetically engineered pesticide products, one against
the <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION> potato beetle and one against the diamond-back
moth that attacks cabbage and broccoli. The company holds 22
of the 39 <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> patents issued for new B.t. strains over the
last four years, according <PERSON>Mr. Kim</PERSON>.
   He said that the discovery of the previously unknown
strains of B.t. underscores the diverse nature of the
bacterium. Researchers at <ORGANIZATION>Mycogen</ORGANIZATION> and elsewhere had
encountered isolated cases where certain B.t. strains were
found effective against mosquitoes and nematodes. "But they
were considered anomalies," he said. "We didn't think there
were strains of B.t. that could be effectively targeted
against just about everything between amoeba and nematodes."
   He said <ORGANIZATION>Mycogen</ORGANIZATION> researchers isolated the novel B.t.
strains from sandy beaches, household dusts, soil on top of
leaves and other soil samples collected from 50 countries.
The strains were processed in its laboratories in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> in
collaboration with Japanese scientists.

FT  31 OCT 92 / Gardening: Beating pests the natural way - Arthur Hellyer
discovers a friendly way of dealing with unwelcome visitors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARTHUR HELLYER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A GREAT deal of natural biological control of insect pests goes on in the
garden quite naturally and without any particular help from the gardener,
except the obvious one of avoiding the use of chemical or other treatments
that might be harmful to the beneficial organisms.
This is now well understood, and the great reduction in the usage of garden
chemicals is partly due to the desire to preserve 'friendly' creatures -
such as ladybird larvae and lacewing flies - that are valuable scavengers in
the garden.
What is not so well known is that some methods of biological control
actually involve deliberately introducing organisms to the garden or
greenhouse.
One of the oldest of these is the white fly parasite, Encarsia formosa, a
tiny wasp which lays its eggs in the white fly scales that are attached to
the leaves of infested plants, sometimes in great numbers. The encarsia eggs
hatch into larvae which devour the scales, so preventing more adult white
flies appearing from them.
This parasite is not a native of <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> and must be artificially introduced
to the greenhouse in which there are white fly infested plants.
This is usually done by hanging up leaves that bear white fly scales already
infested with encarsia and leaving them to develop into adult wasps, which
will then carry on the good work.
In <DATE>winter</DATE>, due to lack of warmth and also of white fly scales to keep larvae
fed, this parasite usually dies out and has to be reintroduced the following
year. Of course, a parasite of any kind is dependant on its prey for its own
survival and so can never eliminate a pest altogether but, hopefully, it can
restrict it to tolerable levels.
A second predator that has been used with considerable success to control
the greenhouse red spider mites is called Pytoseiulus persimilis. It is
itself a mite, though of a different kind - one might say one that lives on
meat rather than on vegetables.
Both the adult stage of this mite and the nymph devour adult nymphs and eggs
of the greenhouse red spider mite. Again, if they do it too successfully,
they will automatically destroy themselves since they have no other food
supply.
More recently, a third predator has been added to this list of organisms
that can be used to control pests. This is a minute nematode - what
gardeners often refer to as an eelworm. Some are quite large but this one,
which feeds on the grubs of the vine weevil, is too small to be seen with
the naked eye. Unlike the other two predators this one is native to <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>
but is not present everywhere and most likely will have to be introduced.
The method of introduction is quite different. The nematodes are despatched
in a moist, inert carrier and on arrival are mixed with water and applied as
a drench to the soil that is infested with vine weevil larvae. These
nematodes are as exclusive as encarsia and pytoseiulus in their feeding
habits and present no hazard to any other organism, including human beings
and their pets.
This parasite is marketed as Nemasys by <ORGANIZATION>Defender</ORGANIZATION>, a company that can supply
other predators and parasites. The address is P0 Box 131, <LOCATION>Ashford</LOCATION>, Kent TN25
5TQ. Defender is a branch of <ORGANIZATION>Biological Pest Control</ORGANIZATION>, which supplies growers
throughout the <ORGANIZATION>UK</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>.
Both the adults and the grubs of the vine weevil damage vines and many other
plants. The weevil eats the edges of leaves, giving them an unsightly,
notched appearance, but the damage done by the larvae is much more serious,
though largely unseen. They work underground, gnawing away at roots, and
they attack many other plants beside grape vines.
This pest has been on the increase since the withdrawal of effective soil
insecticides and so the introduction of the parasitic nematode is a real
step forward. It needs a temperature of above 14'C to be fully active. It is
effective outdoors until the end of <DATE>September</DATE> and under glass for a much
longer period, even throughout the <DATE>winter</DATE> if there is adequate heating.
With most methods of biological control it is advisable to supplement the
treatment with chemical control in certain circumstances.
Thus, with white fly one could use a pyrethrum spray or aerosol to reduce
the number of white flies before introducing encarsia formosa, but there
should be an interval of about seven days before the parasite is introduced.
The adult vine weevils are not directly attacked by the parasitic nematode
but can be reduced in numbers with a spray of gamma HCH or pirimiphos
methyl.
An excellent leaflet on these matters has been prepared by <ORGANIZATION>ICI Garden
Products</ORGANIZATION> and should be available at most garden shops or direct from <ORGANIZATION>ICI</ORGANIZATION>,

   Root rot and crown rot, army worms and cutworms, blister beetles
and Japanese beetles, lace bugs, mealy bugs and spittle bugs: this
is just a sampling of the ills that plants are heir to.
   Some can be prevented; some treated by natural or chemical means.
   Many experts say that a healthy plant is less likely to succumb
to illness or damage, while others say this may be more coincidence
than direct cause and effect. But it's generally agreed that the
conditions that make the plant healthy are also likely to help curb
the spread of pests and disease.
   <PERSON>Joel Flagler</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Rutgers University</ORGANIZATION> agricultural-resources
management agent for <LOCATION>Bergen County</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>, says that for a plant to
be healthy, it must be suited to the conditions under which it will
grow. Soil, moisture and light must all be appropriate. He and
others suggest having soil tested. It can be done through the <ORGANIZATION>U.S.
Department of Agriculture's Cooperative Extension</ORGANIZATION> services
throughout the country. And there are kits for testing soil oneself.
   Some pests can be avoided or controlled through ``companion
planting'' _ planting one plant as a decoy or pest repellent near
another that one is cultivating. <PERSON>Thalassa Cruso</PERSON>, in ``Making
Vegtetables Grow,'' suggests nasturtiums to lure aphids from
cucumbers, marigolds to control root nematodes (microscopically
small worms), and plenty of garlic as an overall repellent. She also
relays suggestions that dill will keep away tomato worms, mint
provides insurance against ants, and radishes protect cucumbers,
squash and melons.
   Rotating crops is another way to keep pests or disease from
getting established. And gardeners can buy certified seed and plants
bred to be disease-resistant. Also, isolate for a while any new
plant you acquire through gift or purchase, so you can determine
whether it is healthy.
   And don't forget the bugs that eat other bugs, and the birds with
their appetite for insects.
   A home gardener who has read up on the subject or had a bit of
experience may be able to diagnose some plant problems: Highly
visible white flies, the fine webs that spider mites leave on the
underside of leaves, Japanese beetles. If a plant is cut off at the
soil line, you may find a cutworm (a type of grub) in the
surrounding soil. Remove and squash it.
   Remove-and-squash is not a particularly attractive idea, but it's
also useful against tomato worms, slugs, Japanese beetles and the
Japanese beetle grub, which resembles a cutworm.
   Other plant ailments are harder to diagnose, and the gardener may
wish to follow the suggestion of ``1,000 Garden Questions, Vol.
II,'' edited by <PERSON>Marjorie Dietz</PERSON>, and send a sample to the nearest
Agricultural Experiment Station for analysis.
   In the case of some pests, a strong blast of water from a hose
may drive them away. A spraying with insecticidal soap is another
possible solution.
   Then there are the pesticides.
   Some _ rotenone and pyrethrum, for instance _ have organic
sources. They come from plants. Others are chemical compounds.
   Garden experts urge one to use any pesticide exactly as directed.
   They warn, too, that what harms the pest may also hurt other
insect or animal life. For instance, <PERSON>Elvin MacDonald</PERSON>, director of
special projects at the <LOCATION>Brooklyn</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Botanic Garden</ORGANIZATION>, says that
systemic pesticides, working through the soil, may hurt friendly
bacteria as well as harmful ones.
   For anyone inclined to blame geography for his gardening
troubles, <PERSON>Dara Emery</PERSON>, a plant breeder at the <LOCATION>Santa Barbara</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>,
<PERSON>Botanic Garden</PERSON>, offers consolation of a sort: Most plant problems
can occur anywhere. True, he says, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> roses have less black
spot and rust, but mildew and spotted mites still cause problems.
And people in other parts of the country don't have the problem of
salts that get into the soil in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> through needed irrigation.
   Finally, the gardener pestered by pests can always resort to an
old-fashioned solution mentioned by <ORGANIZATION>MacDonald</ORGANIZATION>: Grow enough for
everyone, including the insects.

<HL> WHAT'S NEW:
Measuring Body
By Sound Waves

<TEXT>
   {This is one of an occasional series of reports on technology that has reached the early stages of application.} 

   A new way to measure the body volume of humans is being developed. 

   If scientists and doctors know a person's weight and body volume they can determine the body's relative composition of water, fat, lean muscle and chemicals. 
This is important when, for example, doctors need to know if weight gains of premature infants and other patients are due to changes in fat, water or muscle content. 
Also, nutrition researchers, athletic teams and diet spas want to know whether people on various diets are either losing or gaining fat, muscle or just water. 

   A rough method of estimating body volume is to measure the thickness of a fold of skin. 
A more-reliable method is to immerse the body in water and measure how much water it displaces. 
But immersion is sometimes impractical or inconvenient. 

   Now a drier method is being developed by <PERSON>W. Gregory Deskins</PERSON>, a mechanical engineer at <ORGANIZATION>Hoover, Keith &amp; Bruce Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, an acoustical-engineering firm in <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Deskins</PERSON>, aided by a grant from the <ORGANIZATION>National Institutes of Health</ORGANIZATION>, has developed a chamber into which a loudspeaker broadcasts a low-frequency sound. 
The chamber resonates, much as an empty soda bottle resonates when one blows across the bottle top. 
When a person is in the chamber, it resonates at a higher frequency; the change in frequency tells how much volume the body is occupying. 

   The chamber, which is about a year away from the manufacturing stage, probably will be used first by nutrition scientists in research on infants' body composition, <PERSON>Mr. Deskins</PERSON> says. 
In addition to sports teams and diet spas, users of the chamber might eventually include meat packers who seek to determine the fat composition of animals on the hoof. 

   Nematode Nemesis
   The nematode may be brought to heel by an extract of crab shells. 

   Nematodes are tiny parasitic worms that dwell in the soil and cause an estimated <MONEY>$3 billion</MONEY> of damage a year to crops and gardens. 
Unlike other soil microbes, the nematode larvae contain a complex sugar called chiten, explains <PERSON>Robert Milch</PERSON>, the president of <ORGANIZATION>Igene Biotechnology Inc.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Columbia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Md</LOCATION>. 
If extraneous chiten is mixed in the soil, it will trigger other soil microbes to produce an enzyme that destroys it. 
Thus, mixing chiten with soil sets off a kind of chemical warfare that destroys nematode larvae. 

   Crab, oyster and clam shells are rich in chiten and <ORGANIZATION>Igene</ORGANIZATION> has found an inexpensive way to extract it, <PERSON>Dr. Milch</PERSON> says. 
After extracting residual meat from crab-shell wastes to produce a flavoring compound, <ORGANIZATION>Igene</ORGANIZATION> dissolves away the calcium with an acid. 
This leaves a chiten-and-protein mix that <ORGANIZATION>Igene</ORGANIZATION> has turned into a product it calls ClandoSan. 
The protein spurs the growth of fungi and other microbes thought to attack adult nematodes. 

   Igene plans to market ClandoSan later this year, after tests of its effectiveness are completed at <ORGANIZATION>Auburn University</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Hebrew University</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION>. 
Since chiten is a natural pesticide, formal federal approval may not be needed for ClandoSan, <PERSON>Mr. Milch</PERSON> says. 
Igene notes that most synthetic chemicals formerly used against nematodes have been banned because of environmental problems. 

   New Healing Salve
   A healing salve prepared from blood is being developed. 

   A <ORGANIZATION>University of Minnesota</ORGANIZATION> surgeon, <PERSON>David R. Knighton</PERSON>, explains that after a burn, cut or other wound the body produces substances that trigger tissue regrowth and healing. 
Some of these healing factors have been tracked to the platelets, tiny plate-shaped particles that help blood to clot. 
<PERSON>Dr. Knighton</PERSON>, working with <ORGANIZATION>CuraTech Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a small company in which the <ORGANIZATION>University of Minnesota</ORGANIZATION> holds a stake, has developed a "platelet-derived wound-healing formula" using platelets from a wounded patient's own blood. 
The formula is made into a salve applied with gauze. 

   Initial tests on burns, chronic ulcers and other wounds that are slow to heal are promising, although definitive controlled tests on burn patients are still to be completed. 
"It's not a miracle potion," <PERSON>Dr. Knighton</PERSON> says. 
But, he notes, "this is the way nature heals wounds; all we're doing is mimicking it." 
One theoretical attribute of the salve is that blood contains factors that turn off tissue regrowth the moment a wound is sealed. 
Thus, the salve should help reduce scarring. 

   The researcher is now working on ways to extend the shelf life of the salve and to see if the healing factors can be extracted from donated blood rather than just the wounded patient's own blood.

<TEXT>
   It's that time of the year when the <ORGANIZATION>Agriculture
Department</ORGANIZATION>'s bug writers turn out reports about the creepy, crawly,
hoppy things that chew on crops and livestock.
   Some of the reports turned out by specialists in the department's
<ORGANIZATION>Agricultural Research Service</ORGANIZATION> involve space-age technology, foreign
entomological recruiting and even sex, one of the favorite weapons
of pest managers.
   And when a fierce insect predator attacks a lace bug ... well,
the details aren't for small children.
   Take the common grasshopper, a notorious villain with an appetite
for almost anything in the plant world. Or nematodes, ticks, weevils
and sundry other kinds of critters that make farmers, ranchers and
home gardeners fret.
   ``Grasshoppers like to sit in the sun,'' says <ORGANIZATION>USDA</ORGANIZATION> research
entomologist <PERSON>Raymond I. Carruthers</PERSON>. ``If it's cold, a grasshopper
can't develop quickly. It might not develop to adulthood at all
during its growing season _ from <DATE>May into September</DATE>.''
   Don't feel sorry for the hopper, though. Millions of them chew on
pastures each year, destroying almost a fourth of the forage grasses
in 17 of 22 Western states. And migrating grasshoppers also ravage
potatoes, alfalfa and other crops.
   The internal body heat of the sun-loving hoppers serves the
insects another way, by protecting them against certain diseases.
For example, <PERSON>Carruthers</PERSON> said one fungus _ Entomphaga grylli _ would
show promise as a biological control if it could stand the heat.
   <PERSON>Carruthers</PERSON> said the fungus can stand about 100 degrees Fahrenheit
for six to eight hours before starting to die. Grasshoppers in
laboratory tests have been shown to ``actually cure themselves by
basking in the light,'' he said.
   But a type of E. grylli from <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> can stand greater heat
exposure and may be introduced on Western rangeland as early as this
<DATE>summer</DATE>, <PERSON>Carruthers</PERSON> said.
   In parts of <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> and other rangeland areas of the West,
snakeweed and other unwanted brush is a costly and persistent
problem for livestock producers. Maybe two South American insects
will help.
   A weevil named Heilipodus ventralis and a moth called Carmenta
haematica attack the roots of snakeweed, a plant that infests 143
million acres in western states.
   Entomologist <PERSON>Jack DeLoach</PERSON>, who works for the <ORGANIZATION>USDA</ORGANIZATION> agency in
<ORGANIZATION>Temple</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, said federal approval has been granted to introduce
the weevil into the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>. But the moth is still being
tested, he said.
   Agency scientists are looking at biological controls for brush
because chemicals are too expensive in areas where it takes 20 to 50
acres to provide grazing for one cow for a year, he said.
   Besides snakeweed, which can cause pregnant cows to abort,
targeted brush includes saltcedar, which infests about a million
acres along Western streams, and baccharis, a willow-like shrub
found from <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>.
   Other possible brush enemies are being looked at, including some
from <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>, and at least a dozen insect species from
<LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION>.
   But sometimes a natural ally shows up no farther away than a
potted azalea at the <ORGANIZATION>USDA</ORGANIZATION>'s main research center in <LOCATION>Beltsville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Md</LOCATION>.
In this case, it was a natural enemy of lace bugs, the most serious
enemies of azaleas.
   Entomologist <PERSON>John W. Neal</PERSON> and colleagues discovered an insect
predator _ Stethoconus japonicus _ in <DATE>1985</DATE> on a U.S.-grown potted
azalea. Studies since have shown that a single female predator,
which has a needle-like snout, can consume five or six lace bugs
each day. The slightly smaller male handles two or three.
   ``The lace bug doesn't have a chance,'' <PERSON>Neal</PERSON> said. ``The predator
sidles up, undetected, and gives its unsuspecting victim a lethal
injection through its long, needle-like mouth. Holding onto the lace
bug with front legs, the predator then withdraws all body fluids and
tissue, leaving an externally intact but completely drained shell.''
   Down in the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION>, researchers have released 5.6 million
hybrid cattle fever ticks on <LOCATION>St. Croix Island</LOCATION> in the <LOCATION>U.S. Virgin
Islands</LOCATION> to see if they might be used to keep cattle tick fever from
spreading into the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> along the U.S.-Mexico border.
   The hybrid male ticks are sterile and do not produce sperm, said
entomologist <PERSON>Ron Davey</PERSON>. The females are fertile but pass on the
sterility to male offspring. ``The result is a population crash,''
he said.
   Cattle fever, or babesiosis, kills up to <PERCENT>80 percent</PERCENT> of adult
cattle that are infected by it. All <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> breeds are susceptible,
<PERSON>Davey</PERSON> said, but humans do not get cattle tick fever and are not
bitten by the ticks.
   One of the most encouraging bits of news for many soybean farmers
is a new bean variety that could be available next year. The
variety, <PERSON>Cordell</PERSON>, will be the first commercial soybean resistant to
``Race 5'' nematodes, microscopic worms that infest as much as <PERCENT>70
percent</PERCENT> of the soybean acreage in the mid-South and Southeast.
   The so-called cyst nematodes are designated as specific ``races''
because of the types of soybeans in which they reproduce. <PERSON>Lawrence
D. Young</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>USDA</ORGANIZATION> plant pathologist at <LOCATION>Jackson</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Tenn.</LOCATION>, said <PERSON>Cordell</PERSON>
could be suited for planting in <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Tennessee</LOCATION>,
southern <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION>, northern <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION> and parts
of <LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION>.

   In the antenna-to-antenna combat of the insect world, the
predatory anthocorid wields terrifying powers.
   Just ask Bunting Biological Control Ltd. of Great
Horkesley, England. The company is breeding millions of the
three-millimeter Rambos. It aims to sell them this spring or
summer to greenhouse-vegetable growers in need of troops to
deploy against the dreaded Western flower thrip, an avid
muncher of peppers and cucumbers.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Bunting's brochure describes how the anthocorids operate:
"Both the adults and the nymphs feed by inserting their
proboscis-like mouthparts into the prey and sucking out the
body juices." Not just one or two helpings, either: Bunting
promises that its bugs will drain as many as 15 thrips a day.
The predators also snack on aphids and spider mites. If
nothing else is around, they devour one another.
   But it's a bug-eat-bug business, and greenhouse farmers
can't be too fastidious about the thuggish habits of some of
their allies, known in the trade as "natural enemies" or
"beneficial insects."
   For a few dozen mite-size European and <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> companies,
finding and breeding these natural enemies is becoming a
fast-growing business.
   Although greenhouse farmers began dabbling with natural
enemies in the <DATE>1930s</DATE>, such pest control remained little more
than a curiosity for decades. After World War II, new
chemical pesticides proved so devastating that few farmers
bothered with any other weaponry. Then, in the <DATE>1960s</DATE> and
<DATE>1970s</DATE>, some farmers began to doubt that it was healthy for
people who work in glasshouses to spray lots of chemicals
around.
   One of the doubters was Jan <PERSON>Pieter Koppert</PERSON>, a Dutch
greenhouse grower whose respiratory problems prompted him to
experiment with natural enemies for his own use in the late
<DATE>1960s</DATE>. Soon he was selling killer insects to his neighbors.
Now <ORGANIZATION>Koppert B.V.</ORGANIZATION>, owned and managed by the late <PERSON>Mr. Koppert</PERSON>'s
sons, exports brandname bugs as far afield as <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION>. In the past five years, the company's annual
sales have more than tripled to around <MONEY>30 million guilders</MONEY>
(<MONEY>$16.6 million</MONEY>). That, says export manager Cor-Jan van der
Elzen, makes <PERSON>Koppert</PERSON> "the main leader in the world" of
natural enemies. (The company also supplies bumble bees for
pollination work-along with bee food called BeeHappy.)
   Koppert and rival companies -- such as <LOCATION>Bunting</LOCATION> and Chr.
<PERSON>Hansen</PERSON>'s Bio Systems AS of <LOCATION>Denmark</LOCATION> -- remain bullish on bugs.
Tough environmental rules in many countries are pressuring
farmers to use fewer chemical pesticides and making those
pesticides more expensive to develop. At the same time, some
consumers are clamoring for unsprayed fruit and vegetables.
   So far, most people aren't willing to pay the premium for
unsprayed produce. But <PERSON>Joop van Lenteren</PERSON>, an expert on
natural enemies at the <ORGANIZATION>Agricultural University</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Wageningen</LOCATION>,
the <LOCATION>Netherlands</LOCATION>, thinks the trend is toward fussier
consumers. "In <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>," he says, "they're even more keen on
clean food than we are here."
   To satisfy that demand, bug breeders scour the wilderness
for new predators and parasites. The trick is to track down
the most efficient killers. Frogs, for instance, may eat lots
of insects, but they can't be relied upon to go after any
particular pest. Certain types of mites, on the other hand,
zero right in on thrip larvae.
   So <PERSON>Koppert</PERSON> breeds mites and packs them into plastic
bottles marked Thripex. It advises cucumber growers to
sprinkle the mites over their plants like salt.
   Among other hired guns on the market are aphid midges,
lacewings, ladybird beetles, mealybug destroyers, gypsy moths
and onion maggots. The predatory snail (Rumina decollata)
stands ready to pounce on garden snails.
   Since no one can patent a snail or an insect, competition
can be fierce; new suppliers keep crawling out of the
woodwork. Two years ago, Biolab of <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> opened a
state-of-the-art bug plant near <LOCATION>Cesena</LOCATION>, partly financed by
government funds. Koppert is so wary of rivals that it
refuses to let visitors tour its labs or breeding plant. <PERSON>Mr.
van Lenteren</PERSON> says Russian scientists plied him with vodka,
unsuccessfully, to learn bug-production secrets.
   Even a few giant companies are getting involved. <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>'s
<ORGANIZATION>BASF AG</ORGANIZATION>, for example, sells capsules full of ichneumon flies
to combat the infamous corn borer. <ORGANIZATION>Imperial Chemical
Industries PLC</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> doesn't sell insects but offers
chemical pesticides designed for use alongside them.
   Rather than breeding bugs, big chemical and drug companies
generally are more interested in developing bacteria, fungi
and viruses to serve as "biopesticides." County <ORGANIZATION>Natwest
WoodMac</ORGANIZATION>, a British stockbroker, estimates that the world
market for biopesticides -- most of them based on a bacterium
called Bt, or Bacillus thuringiensis -- totals <MONEY>$120 million</MONEY> a
year, or <PERCENT>0.5%</PERCENT> of the global market for agrochemicals. Natural
enemies constitute an even smaller business.
   Even <PERSON>Mr. van Lenteren</PERSON>, one of the world's leading
advocates of natural enemies and other types of biological
pest control, doesn't think they can render chemicals
obsolete.
   For now, natural enemies are unleashed mainly in
greenhouses. Outdoors, a bigger variety of pests and
unpredictable weather make it hard for warrior bugs to
perform reliably; most farmers stick to chemical weapons for
their field crops. Still, natural enemies are sometimes used
outdoors for strawberries, apples, cotton and corn.
   <PERSON>Mr. van Lenteren</PERSON> thinks more outdoor applications are
possible. He preaches using natural enemies along with
chemical pesticides in a way that minimizes the need for the
latter.
   Toward that end, he and his colleagues in <LOCATION>Wageningen</LOCATION> are
using government grants to study bug warfare.
   Remember <PERSON>Pavlov</PERSON>'s dog? Meet van <ORGANIZATION>Lenteren</ORGANIZATION>'s insect. When a
young woman wore a potent perfume in the lab one day, <PERSON>Mr. van
Lenteren</PERSON>'s students were seized with an inspiration: Why not
teach parasitic wasps to respond to an artificial odor, such
as perfume? The students wafted various perfumes over the
wasps as they laid their eggs. Later the wasps associated
certain scents with egg-laying.
   "Now we know we can train them to many things -- to
shapes, to colors," marvels <PERSON>Mr. van Lenteren</PERSON>. Why bother?
Because, he says, insect breeders will be able to sell bugs
trained to search out a particular enemy more effectively.
<PERSON>Mr. van Lenteren</PERSON> says he's in negotiations to license the
technology to several companies.
   The professor also is teaming up with botanists to try to
make life easier for natural enemies. A case in point is
Encarsia formosa, a parasitic wasp used to counter the white
fly. "Encarsia formosa," <PERSON>Mr. van Lenteren</PERSON> admits, "is a
rather stupid animal in several respects." Peering through
their microscopes, entomologists noted that the wasp kept
stumbling into the minute hairs on cucumber leaves as it
looked for white-fly larvae. "It's like a drunken man on a
sidewalk with many lamp posts," <PERSON>Mr. van Lenteren</PERSON> explains.
   The obvious solution was to seek out a strain of cucumbers
with hairless leaves. But researchers found that Encarsia
formosa, when set loose on a hairless leaf, zipped around so
fast it was liable to pass over a juicy larva without even
noticing. Somehow, the wayward wasp had to be slowed down.
The answer: promote a type of cucumber with <PERCENT>50%</PERCENT> less leaf
hair.
   With such discoveries, <PERSON>Mr. van Lenteren</PERSON> says, "we are
scoring in international journals."
   Suppliers boast about their lab feats, too. One of the hot
areas of research revolves around uses for nematodes.
   Bunting already is promoting its Nemasys brand of
nematodes as a scourge for sciarid flies and vine weevils.
Stored in a special gel, the nematodes come in convenient
packages of 50 million. <PERSON>James Finch</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Bunting</ORGANIZATION>'s marketing
manager, concedes it's difficult for customers to be sure of
the count in each pack. "They have to trust us," he says.

<LEADPARA>  COMPANION planting is a friendly, old-time garden practice. It means growing
two or more kinds of plants close together with the hope that mutual benefits
will result.;    Companion planting is not the same as successive planting --
garden arrangements where an early-maturing crop is followed by a
late-maturing crop as soon as it has been harvested.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Garden  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  COMPANION PLANTING GETS IT TOGETHER  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Technique  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     In short, companion planting uses several plantings in the garden at the
same time -- for example, radishes, <DATE>spring</DATE> onions or leaf lettuce can be
planted so rows of sweet corn, peppers or tomatoes can be sown between them.
The early crops mature before the taller crops shade them too much.;    One
plant may form support for another, for example, climbing green beans and tall
varieties of sweet corn planted close together. Tall plants also may become
windbreaks for tender, smaller plants growing nearby.;    Roots of some green
plants develop a symbiotic relationship with beneficial fungi in the soil
called micorrhiza. They may produce growth substances, or help the uptake of
nutrients such as phosphorous. Crops growing close together may share the same
micorrhiza, which improves growth and, it is thought, seems to indicate that
the plants "like" each other.;    There is some controversy about beliefs that
plants are able to protect each other against attack by some insects.;    A
few years ago, companion trial tests were made at <ORGANIZATION>Pennsylvania State
University</ORGANIZATION> to determine if radish could be matched with other plants for
striped cucumber beetle control; marigold with beans for Mexican bean beetle
control; thyme with cabbage for cabbage worm control; onion with carrot for
leaf hopper control; and catnip with eggplant for flea beetle control.;    The
results showed that none of these plants protected its companion from attack
by any pest.;    Another concept -- that marigolds protect nearby plants from
nematodes -- found no verification in tests at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Georgia</ORGANIZATION>. One
study showed that some marigolds attracted nematodes that are then killed
within the roots. A researcher reported this would only be useful to suppress
the buildup of nematodes but would not protect existing plants.  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Brazilian Fly Released to Control Spreading Crop Pest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A red-eyed Brazilian fly was turned
loose <DATE>Friday</DATE> in an experimental effort to control the mole cricket,
which chews up <MONEY>$47 million</MONEY> worth of crops and lawns each year.
   The first release of 250 fly pupae in an <LOCATION>Alachua County</LOCATION> pasture
will probably be followed by others throughout the <DATE>summer</DATE>, said
<PERSON>Howard Frank</PERSON>, director of the project at the <ORGANIZATION>University of
Florida's Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``We're optimistic, but the whole thing is a big experiment,''
said <PERSON>Frank</PERSON>.
   The mole cricket, which probably arrived by ship from <LOCATION>South
America</LOCATION>, damages vegetation by tunneling through it.
   The pest is now spreading into <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>South
Carolina</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Frank</PERSON> said
   The Brazilian fly, about the size of a house fly, comes to the
mating call of male mole crickets, and lays her living larvae on or
near the singer. The larvae then burrow into the male and his mates.
   Ten days later the mole cricket is dead, said <PERSON>Tom Walker</PERSON>, the
<ORGANIZATION>IFAS</ORGANIZATION> entomologist who will monitor the progress of the Brazilian
fly.
   ``We should know in a year if the larvae are surviving,'' said
<PERSON>Frank</PERSON>. ``And in two years we'll have a reasonable idea of whether
it's a success.''
   The <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Department of Agriculture</ORGANIZATION> granted permission to release
the flies after laboratory tests demonstrated they only attack mole
crickets.
   The fly is the third biocontrol agent that <ORGANIZATION>IFAS</ORGANIZATION> has unleashed in
<LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> against mole crickets.
   A wasp that subdues mole crickets but does not sting people was
the first. Turned loose in <DATE>1981</DATE> near <LOCATION>Fort Lauderdale</LOCATION>, the colony is
holding its own there. They mainly attack a tropical mole cricket
that is only a pest in <LOCATION>South Florida</LOCATION>, however.
   Nematodes, microscopic worms, were released in <DATE>1985</DATE> and <DATE>1986</DATE> in
several <LOCATION>Alachua</LOCATION> pastures. Offspring are still there and seem to
have caused a decline in mole cricket populations at the release
sites, but <PERSON>Frank</PERSON> says the nematodes are harder to handle than the
Brazilian fly.

<FP=106> [Article by Scha: "Progress in Biological Plant Protection; </F>
<ORGANIZATION>Ciba-Geigy</ORGANIZATION> Brings Two New Biological Products to Market"] 
  [Text] Bielefeld--The use of biological plant protectants 
is today still subject to many limitations. Their production is 
mainly labor-intensive and costly, their storability often very 
short, delivering them to the plants is also labor-intensive and 
costly, their effectiveness often limited, and the user has to 
be very knowledgable about them. <ORGANIZATION>Ciba-Geigy</ORGANIZATION>, which claims to be 
the leading firm in the plant protection market, has now 
introduced the first bioproducts ready for marketing in <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> 
to control pests and diseases biologically in commercial 
horticulture and tree nurseries which, according to <PERSON>Jakob 
Brassel</PERSON>, the director of the <ORGANIZATION>Ciba</ORGANIZATION> department for research and 
development on biological plant protection, signify a 
breakthrough in this sector. Whereas up to now biological 
control agents have accounted for only <PERCENT>1.5 percent</PERCENT> of all 
pesticides worldwide, this percentage is expected to grow to <PERCENT>5 
percent</PERCENT> by the year <DATE>2000</DATE>. By then <ORGANIZATION>Ciba</ORGANIZATION> wants to have developed a 
product line of biological pest and disease-control agents. 
  Based on live elvers (nematodes), the bioproducts "Exhibit 
F27" and "Exhibit G25" that have now been introduced will be 
used in the cultivation of ornamental plants to control the 
larvae of small gnats [Lycoriidae] or of the dreaded 
<PERSON>Dickmaulruessler</PERSON> [a type of insect pest]. In <DATE>1992</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>Ciba</ORGANIZATION> concluded 
a worldwide developement and marketing agreement for 
nematode-based products with the American firm <ORGANIZATION>Biosys</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Palo 
Alto</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, and it possesses the marketing rights for the 
whole world, with the exception of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>. The nematodes are 
produced in the trillions in biofermenters, emptied into fabric 
hoses pervious to air, and in the process embedded in a natural, 
viscous biopolymer. The practical apportionment of 5 million 
units allows for a dosage that matches production with demand, 
even over smaller areas. The bioproducts are closely bound to 
the insect larvae to produce specific effects and are therefore 
absolutely compatible with plants and the environment. 
  In connection with this, <ORGANIZATION>Ciba-Geigy</ORGANIZATION> stresses the fact that 
chemical plant protection will also be essential in future to 
ensure profits, especially with big crops like, for example, 
wheat, corn, rice, soybeans, and cotton. But in terms of 
integrated plant protection, the combination of biological and 
chemical agents is gaining in importance. Approaches involving 
genetic engineering may also offer ways of solving the problem.

<TEXT>
A microscopic parasitic worm known as the nematode has been plaguing crops
all over the world. But a Central American tree is providing a new way to
fight it.
Nematodes attack many crops. In some cases they can be combated with
existing synthetic solutions. However, these are too toxic for plantation
crops, such as bananas.
The new treatment, DMDP, has been developed by the <ORGANIZATION>Royal Botanical Gardens</ORGANIZATION>
at <LOCATION>Kew</LOCATION> and the Scottish Crop Research institute, from the seeds and leaves
of a Costa Rican tree. It is potentially far less toxic than synthetic
treatments.
DMDP is being further developed by Inbio, a <LOCATION>Costa Rican</LOCATION> conservation
organisation, based in <LOCATION>Heredia</LOCATION>, which is using aerial photographs from <ORGANIZATION>Nasa</ORGANIZATION>
to identify donor trees.

<TEXT>  A With the <ORGANIZATION>EPA</ORGANIZATION>'s ban in the early <DATE>1980s</DATE> of chlordane, the most widely used
termiticide, and its replacement by two less harmful -- but still toxic --
chemicals, pest control specialists have come up with several non-toxic
alternatives for controlling termites. And, unlike earlier techniques that
involved creating a barrier of toxic chemicals around the foundation of a
house, researchers are working toward a termite control system involving the
dissemination of chemicals into the termite colony itself to destroy the
insects. Termites are said to cause about <MONEY>$1 billion</MONEY> in damage to homes and
buildings in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> each year.;    One of the most effective and
environmentally benign ways to control termites involves the pre-construction
treatment of wood surfaces with sodium borate, a boric acid-type compound that
poisons termites and roaches but does not affect other forms of life. Another
pre-construction method involves the use of metal shields set atop the masonry
foundation but below the sill.;    A biological technique to rid an  existing
house of termites, according to professor <PERSON>James Traniello</PERSON>, at <ORGANIZATION>Boston
University</ORGANIZATION>'s biology department, involves the use of nematodes, small
roundworms that penetrate the bodies of termites and are carried back into the
colony, where they destroy more of the insects. Nematodes, which can be
purchased commercially, are mixed in water that is then poured into a trench
around the house.;    The most promising approach under development involves
baiting foundation wood with an appetizing substance laced with a slow-acting
toxicant. When the termites ingest the substance, they take it back to the
colony, where they exchange their food with others, spreading the poison
throughout the colony. Researchers are testing uses of the toxic agents in
conjunction with the alluring food.;    Traniello notes that the best defense
against termites is proper grading and drainage around homes. About <PERCENT>90 percent</PERCENT>
of infestation is caused by contact between wood, on which the termites feed,
and the moist soil in which they nest. If those conditions are alleviated,
there is little risk of termite infestation.;    Q Why is it that grass smells
differently when it has just been mowed?;    -- <LOCATION>P.M.</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Cambridge</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION>; A
Grass is one of many kinds of plants that give off an odor when cut, crushed
or otherwise injured. Some others are sweet clover, mint, cherry laurel and
the pits of apricots.;    <PERSON>Eric Conn</PERSON>, a plant biochemist at the <ORGANIZATION>University of
California</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Davis</PERSON>, said numerous plants contain chemical compounds that
normally are linked to sugars called glycosides, and in this form they are not
released into the air. Cutting or crushing the plant allows a protein called
an enzyme to break down the compound, and it becomes volatile -- escapes into
the air and gives off an odor.;    Scientists don't know why evolution has
caused this mechanism to develop in plants, but <ORGANIZATION>Conn</ORGANIZATION> said it's believed that
in some cases the odor has a defensive purpose. That is, if an insect or other
predator begins to nibble a leaf, the volatile chemical may be noxious,
prompting the insect to stop devouring the plant.;    In the case of grass,
it's not known what purpose the well-known pungent smell serves, <PERSON>Conn</PERSON> said.  </TEXT>

      Advances in Search
   For Superconductors
   RESEARCHERS are trying more complex compounds in their quest for improved superconductor materials. 

   During the past year, they have focused on the so-called 1-2-3 compound, which contains yttrium, barium, copper and oxygen. 
The compound, discovered last <DATE>spring</DATE>, carries electricity without resistance at about minus 290 degrees Fahrenheit, a surprisingly high temperature that opens up new applications. 

   Hoping for further advances, scientists have been working feverishly to get the 1-2-3 compound to work at even higher temperatures and conduct more electricity. 
But recently, reports have surfaced about findings with new, more complex materials. 

   During a visit last month to <ORGANIZATION>Massachusetts Institute of Technology</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Koichi Kitazawa</PERSON>, a University of <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> scientist, reported work at several Japanese laboratories with a five-element superconductor, says <PERSON>Kent Bowen</PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION>MIT</ORGANIZATION> ceramics specialist. 
The material, containing bismuth, strontium, calcium, copper and oxygen, works at about minus 243 degrees Fahrenheit. 
And <PERSON>Paul C.W. Chu</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>University of Houston</ORGANIZATION> physicist who led in the discovery of the 1-2-3 compound, has reported a similar compound that includes aluminum and works at about the same temperature. 

   Because of the new materials' complexity, "people are calling them fruit salads," says <PERSON>Mr. Bowen</PERSON>. 
But more work is required before scientists know whether they'll displace the 1-2-3 compound from the spotlight. 

   AIDS Concerns Spawn
   Medical Workers' Gear
   FEARS ABOUT AIDS spur products to minimize medical workers' risks of getting the disease from patients. 

   Medical workers chances of getting AIDS are low, but the disease can be transmitted in blood and other bodily fluids through accidental needle sticks, scalpel cuts and other slips. 
To ward off accidental cuts, <ORGANIZATION>Whiting &amp; Davis Co.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Plainville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION>, concern known mainly for its accessories for women, recently introduced metal-mesh hospital gloves. 

   The <MONEY>$279-a-pair</MONEY> gloves are designed to be worn over rubber surgical gloves, but their small nickel-plated, brass rings -- about one-twentieth of an inch in diameter -- won't stop needles. 
To deflect at least some needle sticks, the company is developing an even finer metal mesh that resembles cloth, a spokesman says. 

   Another company, <ORGANIZATION>ICU Medical Inc.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Mission Viejo</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, last year introduced needles with movable plastic sheaths that lock over the needles as they are withdrawn from patients. 
And <ORGANIZATION>Meditrend Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, an <LOCATION>Albuquerque</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.M.</LOCATION>, concern, recently introduced a plastic face shield to guard against blood splashes. 

   Hospital-supply companies emphasize that although AIDS is driving the market for such products, the protection they provide against hepatitis B, a virus that also can be transmitted in bodily fluids, may be just as important. 
Hepatitis B can be fatal, and the chances of getting it from accidents like needle sticks is much higher than the chance of getting AIDS the same way, they say. 

   A New Way to Identify
   Types of Cancer Cells
   SCIENTISTS have found a new way to differentiate cells that may improve cancer diagnosis. 

   Biologists at <ORGANIZATION>Massachusetts Institute of Technology</ORGANIZATION> recently discovered that each cell type has its own "nuclear matrix proteins," substances found in a cell's DNA-containing nucleus. 
Determining the particular mix of such proteins may enable scientists to identify a cell's organ of origin, says <PERSON>Sheldon Penman</PERSON>, one of the <ORGANIZATION>MIT</ORGANIZATION> researchers. 
Until now, identifying cell types by analyzing their proteins has been a "Holy Grail" in biology, he adds. 

   The discovery could help cancer specialists distinguish some tumors that, in a process called metastasis, grow from cancer cells that have migrated from their place of origin in the body. 
In perhaps <PERCENT>5%</PERCENT> of cancer patients, doctors can't identify the origin of such tumors and hence aren't sure what treatment to prescribe. 
And in a larger proportion of patients with metastasizing cancer, identifying tumor type requires time-consuming tests. 

   The finding may yield quick, simple tests to identify tumor types. 
A new company, <ORGANIZATION>Matritech Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, recently was formed in <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> to develop commercial products from the <ORGANIZATION>MIT</ORGANIZATION> research. 
Experiments also suggest "the matrix proteins may indicate the degree and nature of malignancy" in cancer, says <PERSON>Mr. Penman</PERSON>. 

   Thwarting Advances
   Of Crop-Raiding Insects
   POISON-PILL defenses are being developed against crop takeovers by insects. 

   The pills are microscopic gelatin-like capsules designed to be sprayed on crops and eaten by harmful insects. 
They contain organisms that produce substances toxic to the bugs. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Mycogen Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>, begins with bacteria that have been genetically engineered to spew more insect toxins than their natural kin. 
The bacteria are killed and encapsulated with their toxins, naturally occurring chemicals that won't hurt beneficial insects or animals, <ORGANIZATION>Mycogen</ORGANIZATION> says. 

   The capsules help prevent the toxins from breaking down before they are eaten. 
The company says that because its bacteria are dead, it already has cleared regulatory hurdles for conducting field tests with the technology and hopes to market it by <DATE>1990</DATE>. 

   Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION>Plant Genetics Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Davis</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, is developing similar capsules containing nematodes, tiny worms on which corn rootworms, fire ants, termites and other pests dine. 
When eaten, the worms release bacteria that kill the insects. 
Plant Genetics' pills may be available in two to five years, a spokesman says.

<HL> Technology: Parasite Infections Of Raw-Fish Eaters Show Recent Rise --- Scientists Report Main Cause Is Increase in Protected Sea-Mammal Population </HL>
<AUTHOR> Amal Kumar Naj (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR>
<SO> </SO>
<IN> FOD ENV </IN>
<TEXT>
   Parasite infections of people who like to eat raw or undercooked fish are increasing, and the main cause is the rising population of seals and other protected marine mammals, scientists reported. 

   Such creatures as dolphins, sea lions and seals are normally heavily infested with two types of nematodes whose eggs the mammals expel in their feces. 
The immature worm-like larvae are then eaten by tiny shrimp-like crustacea, which in turn are eaten by squid and some fish. 
The larvae can end up in the stomach and intestines of people who eat infected fish in its raw or undercooked state. 

   A medical rarity in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> until recently, human infection by the fish parasites, called Anisakidae, has increased markedly. 
Although 50 cases have been reported -- <PERCENT>70%</PERCENT> of them since 1980-they may be "the tip of the iceberg," because the infection is difficult to diagnose, the scientists wrote in the latest issue of the <ORGANIZATION>New England Journal of Medicine</ORGANIZATION>. 

   The researchers included <PERSON>James H. McKerrow</PERSON> and <PERSON>Judy Sakanari</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>University of California</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, and <PERSON>Thomas L. Deardorff</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Food and Drug Administration</ORGANIZATION>. 

   They trace the rising incidence of worm infection to the legal protection of the sea mammals starting in <DATE>1972</DATE>. 
Since then, their population has "increased to numbers not seen since the <DATE>19th century</DATE>," they said. 
The rising infection rate also reflects the increased popularity of raw fish, such as sushi and sashimi served in Japanese restaurants, the scientists said. 

   The group found the highest incidence of worm infections, about <PERCENT>80%</PERCENT> of all reported cases, on the <LOCATION>West Coast</LOCATION> of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and in <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>. 
"The infections are related to the geographic distribution of the worm-carrying hosts," said <PERSON>Ms. Sakanari</PERSON>, a specialist on marine parasites. 

   The researchers said the worms spend part of their life cycle in such fish as <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> salmon and striped bass and <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> rockfish or snapper. 
The worms then end up in the bellies of the mammals when the mammals eat the fish. 

   When people eat the fish undercooked or raw, the worms penetrate the human stomach or intestines, where they die. 
But before dying, they cause inflammation and pain resembling symptoms of more-common diseases. 
The researchers said the infected people can sometimes feel the worm in their throat in a "tingling" sensation and cough up the worm within 48 hours. 

   One of the more-dangerous types of the nematodes can penetrate the walls of the stomach or the intestines. 
Then "the only way to get rid of it is to go into the stomach or intestines with a fiberoptic endoscope, catch it by the tail and pull it out," said <PERSON>Dr. McKerrow</PERSON>. 

   The researchers said such symptoms of the infection as abdominal pain, fever and nausea are often confused with those of acute appendicitis, chronic bowel inflammation, gastric ulcer or gastrointestinal cancer. 
The scientists said they are developing blood tests that could detect the presence of the worms in humans.

   If you sometimes think the daily grind is a
dog-eat-dog world, you ought to see what goes on between the fungi
and the pathogens.
   Of course, says the <ORGANIZATION>Agriculture Department</ORGANIZATION>, there are good
fungi. But there are also bad fungi. Pathogens? They're the tiny
things like viruses that cause diseases _ and they're mostly bad.
   The idea of using nature's own organisms to fight, hold back and
destroy plant diseases has been around a long time. And the
department's <ORGANIZATION>Agricultural Research Service</ORGANIZATION> says the search
continues for biological ways of protecting crops.
   Recent reports from the agency show the task to be slow and
painstaking. Fungi and bacteria exist naturally in the same soil
that nourishes corn, wheat, rice, cotton, soybeans and even
backyard tomatoes.
   One of the tasks of the scientists is to sort out those
organisms and choose through experiments the ones that can help
protect crops.
   ``Twenty years from now, we'll have many more biological
controls like fungi to use,'' says <PERSON>Deborah R. Fravel</PERSON>, an agency
plant pathologist. ``They may not be as common as chemicals , but
they certainly will be increasingly important. I don't think
biological controls will ever completely replace chemicals, but
they will help reduce the amount of chemicals used.''
   Half a dozen beneficial fungi are being studied at the agency's
<ORGANIZATION>Biocontrol of Plant Diseases Laboratory</ORGANIZATION> in nearby <LOCATION>Beltsville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Md.</LOCATION>,
where <PERSON>Fravel</PERSON> works. Each is under scrutiny for its ability to fight
pathogens such as the bad fungi, bacteria, microscopic worms called
nematodes and even viruses.
   ``The idea is that we can enhance what's out there in nature,''
<PERSON>Fravel</PERSON> said. ``A lot of management practices in use right now, such
as adding organic matter to the soil, actually are biocontrols
because organic matter feeds the organisms already in place.''
   Fungi used in biocontrol fight plant pathogens in several ways:
parasitism, or actually feeding on the pathogen; antibiosis, or
producing some sort of compound that is toxic to the pathogen; and
through competition, the most common action.
   For example, she said, ``Plant roots leak carbon sources such as
sugar. The biocontrol organisms get to those carbon sources before
the pathogens do, so the pathogens can't get anything to eat and
can't grow. Or the biocontrol organisms may simply occupy all the
space around the root so the pathogen can't get in.''
   Fravel and her colleagues are conducting tests in some <LOCATION>New
Jersey</LOCATION> eggplant fields to see how well a beneficial fungus _
Talaromyces flavus _ fights <PERSON>Verticillium</PERSON> wilt disease. In previous
field tests, the fungus in combination with a reduced amount of
chemical fumigant reduced wilt disease in eggplant crops by as much
as <PERCENT>75 percent</PERCENT>.
   <PERSON>Jack A. Lewis</PERSON>, a soil scientist at the <LOCATION>Beltsville</LOCATION> laboratory,
said work recently began on encasing two other fungi _ Trichoderma
and Gliocladium _ in pellets, which then are mixed into infected
soil or potting material to test their effectiveness.
   ``The pellets contain food for the biocontrol fungi,'' <PERSON>Lewis</PERSON>
said. ``The organism grows out of the pellet and spreads through
the soil, where it attacks the pathogen and kills it.''
   A number of other fungi also are being studied as possible
weapons, including some that might be targeted against pathogens
that help cause the rotting of seed and the seedlings of cotton,
sugarbeets and many vegetables and ornamental plants.
   Still other fungi are being used experimentally against some of
their bad relatives noted for causing stalk rot in corn.
   Plant pathologist <PERSON>Nader G. Vakili</PERSON>, who works at the <ORGANIZATION>USDA</ORGANIZATION>
agency's Cereal and <ORGANIZATION>Soybean Improvement Research Unit</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Ames</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>, said the good fungi enter and live inside the corn plant,
where they eat away at the rot fungi.
   Vakili sprayed spores of Melanospora damnosa on corn plants in
test plots. In the first year, the beneficial fungus infected only
about one-half of <PERCENT>1 percent</PERCENT> of the stalk rot fungus, Fusarium
moniliforme, in the stalks. But after five years, as the good
fungus built up in the soil, <PERCENT>50 percent</PERCENT> to <PERCENT>80 percent</PERCENT> were infected.
   The results suggest that strains of biocontrol fungi could be
selected for compatability with specific lines of corn, he said.
The corn would be bred to support large numbers of the fungi
organisms.
   ``In the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> alone, stalk rots reduce yields by some 500
million bushels annually,'' <PERSON>Vakili</PERSON> said.
   But fungi are not the only weapons being looked at by <ORGANIZATION>USDA</ORGANIZATION>
scientists. Chemist <PERSON>Jeffrey S. Buyer</PERSON> and two colleagues have
produced and tested a monoclonal antibody, a custom-built protein,
that will seek out and fasten onto iron-hoarding compounds called
siderophores.
   Virtually all bacteria and fungi, good and bad alike, produce
siderophores to meet their own iron needs, Buyer said. Sometimes,
but not always, these compounds help control pathogens.
   ``Right now, we have no good methods to study the compounds in
their natural state or determine why they sometimes do and
sometimes don't help control disease organisms,'' Buyer said.
   The new antibody, which is headed for greenhouse tests this
<DATE>summer</DATE> on roots of barley seedlings, hopefully will seek and bind
to siderophores so they can be measured and studied more fully.
   Eventually, it may be possible for farmers and home gardeners to
make bad microbes anemic by loading the soil with certain
beneficial bacteria that will deprive the pathogens of their iron
supply.

   Your Aug. 24 article "Good News for Worms: Study Finds
Genetic Clue to Aging in Nematode" notes that the recent
successful mutating of a single gene in the roundworm,
"Caenorhabditis elegans," creates "what might be called the
Methuselahs of the annelid world." May I point out that
annelids, which are segmented worms (earthworms, etc.) belong
to an entirely different phylum than the roundworms, which
are nematodes. The nematodes are a giant step below on the
evolutionary ladder from the annelids.

<HEAD>Sushi Worm Startles Surgeons During Operation</HEAD>

   As he was finishing an emergency appendectomy, <PERSON>Dr.
James W. Turner</PERSON> noticed what he throught was a stray thread on the
surgical drapes. Then it wiggled.
   The thread was actually a 2-inch-long skinny red worm slithering
out of the patient's incision. It was a fish worm, inadvertently
eaten by the patient in sushi the night before.
   The patient was undergoing the operation for abdominal pain, but
doctors believe the worm was the real cause of his misery.
   The incident, described in today's New England Journal of
Medicine, ``is an uncomfortable reminder of the potential danger of
eating raw fish,'' noted <PERSON>Dr. Peter M. Schantz</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Centers
for Disease Control</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>.
   Raw fish in sushi and sashimi has become popular with the spread
of Japanese restaurants in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, but health experts
say most cases of worm infection occur when people prepare raw fish
at home. Experienced sushi chefs are good at spotting wormy fish so
it doesn't reach customers.
   In the latest case, the victim ate raw fish at a friend's home
in <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION>.
   ``He looked like anybody else with appendicitis,'' recalled
<PERSON>Turner</PERSON>, a surgeon at <ORGANIZATION>Booth Memorial Hospital</ORGANIZATION>. ``I operated, and
much to my chagrin the appendix was normal. I was getting ready to
close the abdomen, and I see this little thing, and it looks like
it's moving.
   ``I said, `Wait a minute. There's something wrong. I'll be
damned. It's a worm.'''
   The astonished doctors sent the worm to <ORGANIZATION>Albert Einstein College
of Medicine</ORGANIZATION>, where it was identified as a larval nematode known as
eustrongylides.
   ``There is a clear danger involved in eating raw fish. This
underscores that danger,'' said <PERSON>Dr. Murray Wittner</PERSON>, an Einstein
parasitologist.
   The adult form of eustrongylides is a parasite of fish-eating
birds, while the larvae are found in the flesh of fish that live in
brackish and fresh water.
   In an editorial in the journal, <PERSON>Schantz</PERSON> noted that only four
other cases of human infection with a nematode have been reported.
All were fishermen who swallowed bait minnows whole _ ``a practice
not likely to be widely imitated.''
   The worms most commonly acquired from raw seafood are larvae of
the family Anisakidae. Between 25 and 50 <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> cases have been
documented, but experts believe most cases are not recognized or
reported to health officials.
   The worms often pass harmlessly through the digestive system or
are coughed up a few hours after the meal. Doctors have even
described a condition known as ``tingling throat syndrome,'' which
occurs when the worms get stuck in the back of the throat.
   Sometimes, however, the worms burrow into the wall of the
stomach or the intestines. They must be removed with a tube that's
pushed down the victim's throat.
   <PERSON>Schantz</PERSON> noted that many commercial fish are commonly infected
with worms. These include mackerel, herring, rockfish, salmon and
cod. The parasites also are more common in fish from the <LOCATION>Pacific
Ocean</LOCATION> than from the <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION>.
   The number of worm infections is increasing in the <LOCATION>United
States</LOCATION>. But <PERSON>Schantz</PERSON> doubts that this will ever become a major
health problem, since most Americans still prefer their fish
cooked, which kills the worms.

<PERSON>Sharon Whatley</PERSON> likes to know what her family is eating. 
</P>
<P>
And it's not always easy to find out. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no way to tell what is sprayed on vegetables and fruit before they 
get to the supermarket, and I wanted to have control over that," said the 
<LOCATION>Tustin</LOCATION> resident. 
</P>
<P>
She started a garden in her back yard six years ago to ensure that her family 
ate only naturally grown, chemical-free produce. 
</P>
<P>
Then the bugs invaded her pure environment. 
</P>
<P>
"When I began to get garden pests and went to the nursery for advice, they 
suggested I use harsh chemical methods, which defeated the whole purpose of 
having a garden," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Whatley began searching for alternatives to chemical pest control. She 
conducted research on her own and then hooked up with the <ORGANIZATION>Orange County Organic 
Gardening Club</ORGANIZATION>. She now controls pests organically. 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>Orange County Organic Gardening Club</ORGANIZATION> offers members and guests educational 
programs, speakers and demonstrations. The group meets every second <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> of 
the month at <ORGANIZATION>Mercury Federal Savings</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Tustin</LOCATION>. Seventy families are members of 
the 25-year-old club. 
</P>
<P>
Club members say you can trash the chemicals and start fresh. By using 
alternative pest-control methods, back-yard gardeners avoid the harmful effects 
of chemicals in the soil and on the produce. 
</P>
<P>
"Your first line of defense against pests is to have healthy plants," said <PERSON>Bud 
Anderson</PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION>Organic Gardening Club</ORGANIZATION>. "When plants become 
stressed because of lack of water or nutrition or start aging, pests will 
attack them." 
</P>
<P>
Insects are attracted to yellow -- the color of sickly plants. "Yellow means 
food to them," said <PERSON>Sharron Clark</PERSON>, a professor of biology at <ORGANIZATION>Golden West 
College</ORGANIZATION> who will teach a class on alternative methods of garden maintenance 
this <DATE>fall</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Problems can be prevented by selecting strong, healthy green plants. After 
planting, be sure to keep the area free of debris and remove any yellowing 
leaves or ailing plants. 
</P>
<P>
Another important element to consider during plant selection is disease 
resistance. You can prevent infestations by choosing plants that can ward off 
certain devastating diseases. 
</P>
<P>
When selecting tomato plants, for instance, look for the VFN label, which 
indicates that the plant is resistant to three main types of deadly soil-borne 
diseases. Seed packages also indicate that plants are resistant. 
</P>
<P>
Pests thrive, too, on young, tender plants. Start seeds in containers and 
transplant them when they're the size of plants found in the nursery. 
</P>
<P>
"To protect transplants, put a newspaper collar around the stems," said <PERSON>Clark</PERSON>. 
"This will keep cutworms and other pests away. As the plants grow, the 
newspaper will disintegrate." 
</P>
<P>
Once pesky insects are spotted, there are several organic chemical control 
methods that can be used. Insecticidal soaps are a popular, safe way to 
suffocate aphids, white flies and mealybugs, while not harming friendly 
predators such as lacewings, ladybugs and praying mantises. These soap 
solutions can be made at home or purchased. 
</P>
<P>
To mix your own, put a few drops of dish detergent into water and spray it on 
your plants. If you want a stronger solution, mix fresh onion juice, garlic and 
hot pepper into the soapy water. After some experimentation, every gardener 
comes up with his or her own favorite mixture. 
</P>
<P>
Effective, readily biodegradable insecticidal soaps -- like Safer -- can be 
found in most gardening centers. These are designed to kill aphids, mealybugs, 
whiteflies, mites, tent caterpillars, thrips and other destructive pests. Spray 
in the early morning or late afternoon to avoid leaf burn. 
</P>
<P>
Another chemical that acts as a stomach poison for beetles, thrips, weevils and 
borers is Rotenone, which is an extract from the roots of tropical legumes. It 
is usually found in a combination spray with Pyrethrum. This comes from the 
flower heads of the <ORGANIZATION>Pyrethrum Chrysanthemum</ORGANIZATION>, a form of the daisy found in 
<LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>. Pyrethrum kills leaf hoppers, thrips, whiteflies and aphids. 
</P>
<P>
When using organic chemical sprays, keep in mind that their effects don't last 
long, which is why they don't become part of your food. If pests persist, 
sprays must be reapplied. 
</P>
<P>
Another form of controlling pests is through biological means. "So that we are 
not overrun by any one species in nature, organisms feed on one another," said 
<PERSON>Clark</PERSON>. "You can use such biological controls in your own garden." 
</P>
<P>
A good cure for soil-borne pests such as pill bugs, sow bugs, snails and slugs 
is <LOCATION>Diatamascious Earth</LOCATION>. "This is made up of the shells of a small sea creature 
which is mined from the ocean floor," said <PERSON>Anderson</PERSON>. "When it is mixed into the 
soil, the pests eat them and the sharp edges tear up their insides." 
</P>
<P>
Another control is the bacteria <LOCATION>Bacillus Thuringiensis</LOCATION>, which can kill all 
kinds of caterpillars, fly larvae and worms. "When you see holes in leaves and 
vegetables such as tomatoes and actual caterpillars and worms on your plants, 
spray them with this solution and the pests will soon die from eating the 
leaves and ingesting the bacteria, which poisons their guts," said <PERSON>Clark</PERSON>. This 
product is sold under the brand names Attack and Dipel and is readily 
available. 
</P>
<P>
You can also control pests by introducing certain "good" insects into your 
garden, such as ladybugs, praying mantises, lacewings, spiders and wasps. Many 
of these can be bought at the nursery and set free in your garden. 
</P>
<P>
Barrier methods are also effective in controlling some pests. Whatley has found 
that a shallow pan or dish filled with stale beer and soap stops snails as they 
attempt to climb into her garden. Salt also harms the troublemakers. Stop 
snails by putting salt on cardboard strips and placing them around the 
outskirts of your garden. Avoid getting salt into the soil. 
</P>
<P>
Netting is another effective barrier method for plants such as broccoli and 
cauliflower. This prevents the white cabbage butterfly and other similar 
insects from laying eggs on the plants. 
</P>
<P>
Certain companion plants deter pests. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of their pungent odor, marigolds ward off many pests," said <PERSON>Anderson</PERSON>, 
who has them planted throughout his garden. Nasturtiums are attractive flowers 
that repel aphids and squash bugs. Plant them near cabbage, lettuce, squash and 
radishes. Some herbs are also useful. 
</P>
<P>
"We enjoy the odor and taste of sweet basil, but tomato and cabbage worms don't 
like it," said <PERSON>Anderson</PERSON>. Mint, too, deters many pests that affect cabbage and 
tomatoes. 
</P>
<P>
Don't bunch similar crops in the same area. "Nature doesn't have all of the 
same tree in one spot or a meadow filled with pure grass," said <PERSON>Clark</PERSON>. "When we 
plant all one crop in one area, we upset the balance of nature, and this 
encourages pests, because each type tends to feed on similar crops. 
</P>
<P>
"For instance, if you have rows of lettuce, the insects who feed on that will 
move readily from plant to plant and destroy your crop. However, if you 
interplant dissimilar crops between rows and within rows, when an insect is 
feeding on lettuce and then moves over to radishes, it is likely to find this 
vegetable distasteful." 
</P>
<P>
Many organic gardeners use truly simple solutions: water and picking bugs off 
leaves. Aphids can often be killed with a strong jet of water, while many 
caterpillars, worms and snails can be picked from plants. To catch sow bugs and 
pill bugs, place a piece of wood in the garden and they will crawl under it. 
"Don't kill the blue sow bugs, though," said <PERSON>Clark</PERSON>. "They have a disease that 
will kill the other ones." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, no garden is going to be completely free of pests. "You're not 
insect-proof, you're insect- and pest-deterrent," explained <PERSON>Anderson</PERSON>. "You must 
remember that all of the 'pests' are there for a reason -- they actually have a 
place in the earth's continuum. We don't want to destroy everything, which is 
why alternative methods work so well. They create a natural balance in your 
garden." 
</P>
<P>
Since she started using alternative methods, <PERSON>Whatley</PERSON>'s pest problems have 
decreased. "Five years ago, when I used toxic chemical controls, I constantly 
battled pests," she said. "Today I don't have very many problems. My garden is 
really healthy, and I'm able to eat produce that is chemical-free."

<FP=106> [Article by <PERSON>M.G. Chukhriy</PERSON>, <PERSON>L.F. Voloshchuk</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Biological Plant </F>
Protection Institute</ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION>Moldova Republic Academy of 
Sciences</ORGANIZATION>, `Invitation to Cooperation'] 
  [Text] The long established links among the scientists, 
including our field of biological plant protection, have 
weakened, and a number of cases became broken with the formation 
of many sovereign states on the territory of the former union. 
The <ORGANIZATION>All-Union Institute of Biological Plant Protection Methods</ORGANIZATION> 
which once was a head institute in the <ORGANIZATION>USSR</ORGANIZATION> did not escape this 
fate. After becoming subordinated to the <ORGANIZATION>Moldova Republic 
Academy of Sciences</ORGANIZATION>, it is naturally restructuring its 
activities and in no way does it pretend to play the former role 
of the biological method curator in the <ORGANIZATION>CIS</ORGANIZATION> countries. Yet it 
would be incorrect to regard this large scientific establishment 
to have been ``sliced off.'' The staff, a lot of scientific work 
in progress, and modern equipment still remain, and the plans 
outlined in the past are still being implemented. 
  We should reiterate everything the institute has done in 
recent years. 
  Basic research into the faunistics and taxonomy of a number 
of predators and agricultural crop parasites has been carried 
out, individual methods of using natural entomophagan 
populations have been substantiated, and a range of methods of 
reconstructing the agrobiocenosis of the fruit orchard which 
facilitate the preservation of natural populations of the 
natural pest enemies and increase their efficiency has been 
developed. 
  A comprehensive pesticide-free system of vegetable crop 
protection in enclosed soil using entomophagans and 
microbiological facilities has been developed and is being 
implemented. 
  The institute proposed methods of large-scale phytophagan 
breeding and production of effective entomophagan and viral 
preparations on their basis and developed original resources for 
producing Encarsia, Phytoseiulus, Cecidomyiidae carnivora, 
Amblyseius, and Aphidius; techniques for producing, 
storing, and applying Trichogramma and the methods of 
mass breeding and introduction of perillus and 
podizius have been proposed. 
  New active strains of entomopathogenic fungi, antagonist 
fungi, and hyperparasites and carnivorous pathogenic weed fungi 
have been isolated and regulations have been developed for 
production of biological preparations and application 
technologies for some of them in a series of agricultural crops; 
new baculovirus strains have been isolated and production 
regulations have been developed for viral preparations against 
cotton and cabbage cutworm and American white butterfly. 
  Sexual pheromones of more than 70 species of harmful insects 
have been isolated and production of synthetic pheromones has 
been set up for more than 15 species of agricultural crop pests; 
technologies and their applications have been developed for the 
apple worm and grape leaf roller moth as well as a method of 
pheromone monitoring for observing and indicating the pest 
development. 
  Based on the research, 36 methodological manuals and 
recommendations and more than 300 articles have been printed, 26 
collections on various issues of biological methods have been 
published, and 41 patents have been granted. 
  The VNIIBMZR was given the new name of the <ORGANIZATION>Institute of 
Biological Plant Protection</ORGANIZATION> by the 15 Feb 92 Decree of the 
President of the Republic of <LOCATION>Moldova</LOCATION> and incorporated into the 
<ORGANIZATION>Moldovan Academy of Sciences</ORGANIZATION>. Its mission statement was 
formulated as ``development of the theoretical foundation of 
biological methods and ecologically safe systems of integrated 
plant protection and development of biological facilities and 
technologies for their application.'' 
  The institute will rely on work in progress and the of 
totality world experience in continuing the study of the biology 
and ecology of the principal phytophagan and entomophagan types, 
ways of maintaining, introducing, and activating natural 
populations of friendly insects, development of the mass 
breeding technologies for the effective species of predators, 
parasites, and phytophagan for the production of viral 
insecticides and microbial preparations and identification of 
new microorganism and virus strains. 
  We are also speeding up efforts relating to pheromones and 
the development of the methods of phytosanitary inspection and 
monitoring systems. Individual techniques will be formulated in 
the form of environmentally safe systems of integrated plant 
protection from pests and diseases on the basis of assessing the 
effect of the new technologies. 
  The institute possesses an adequate material and technical 
base and its work sites cover approximately 14,000 
m[.sup]2[/], 59 chambers for insect breeding, 7 climate 
chambers, and a data processing room with computers. 
  We are still interested in strengthening cooperation with 
scientists and production experts from other <ORGANIZATION>CIS</ORGANIZATION> countries and 
are awaiting original proposals. The readers of this journal 
would probably be interested in finding out who is who and who 
does what at our institute. The following is a brief reference.

FT  13 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Canada accuses EC over lumber
ban
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE <ORGANIZATION>EUROPEAN Community</ORGANIZATION> has banned imports of most kinds of untreated
softwood lumber from <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> to protect European forests from a microscopic
but voracious pest known as the pinewood nematode. The ban, which was
formally notified to <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> members last <DATE>Friday</DATE> and takes effect on <DATE>Aug 15</DATE>, has
blown up into the most bitter current trade dispute between <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> and the
<ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION>. While <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> officials regard the new rules as a plant-health precaution,
<LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> sees them as a trade barrier.
The Canadians accuse the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> of over-reacting to the nematode threat, thereby
endangering the livelihood of many sawmill workers in the provinces of <LOCATION>Nova
Scotia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New Brunswick</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>British Columbia</ORGANIZATION>. The Canadian high commission in
<LOCATION>London</LOCATION> has already made several direct representations to UK prime minister
<PERSON>Mr John Major</PERSON>, asking for the ban to be relaxed. The ban affects the bulk of
<LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>'s CDollars 500m-a-year (Pounds 265m) exports of untreated lumber to
<ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> states, of which CDollars 350m is shipped to the <ORGANIZATION>UK</ORGANIZATION>. Under the new rules,
all Canadian lumber exports to <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, with the exception of cedar, must be
either kiln-dried or heat-treated.
<ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> member states agreed earlier this year to allow an exemption for non-pine
species until <DATE>October 1</DATE>. But the commission's plant-health committee revoked
the exemption late last month after UK authorities discovered the
wood-boring insects that carry the nematode in two shipments of lumber from
<LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>.
The nematode has devastated large tracts of pine forest in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>
has acknowledged that pine exports should be heat-treated or dried.
But <LOCATION>Ottawa</LOCATION> disputes scientific evidence supporting the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION>'s case for
treating other species, such as hemlock, spruce and fir. The <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> is unwilling
to take the risk of relaxing the ban, but has offered to co-operate in
further scientific studies.
The Canadians are concerned that the ban will put their timber at a
competitive disadvantage to Scandinavian supplies. Canadian mills will be
forced to spend substantial amounts to install kilns or heat-treating
facilities.
The Canadian argument has an ironic twist, in that resource industries have
for years been urged to put more emphasis on adding value to commodity
exports. But by heating or drying their lumber, the Canadian mills face
being excluded from the large market for cheap, untreated lumber used, for
instance, for cement moulds on construction sites.

<HEAD>Earth's Thin Rhizosphere Layer as Mysterious to Scientists as Space</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s thin layer where plant roots seek
water and nourishment is a world as mysterious as the distant
planets, says <ORGANIZATION>Agriculture Department</ORGANIZATION> scientist <PERSON>Richard W. Zobel</PERSON>.
   It is this layer, or rhizosphere, that determines what kind of
crops can be grown, if any, and where so many of the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s people
can live well.
   <PERSON>Zobel</PERSON>, a plant geneticist, said <DATE>Monday</DATE> that the rhizosphere is a
teeming world of minerals, gases, water and life forms _ insects,
earthworms, microscopic nematode worms, a host of microorganisms,
living and dead plant roots, and the chemicals they exude.
   ``We don't even begin to thoroughly understand it, although
we're slowly pulling it together,'' he said. ``I'd say our
knowledge of the area six inches to two feet below the soil's
surface is comparable to our knowledge of outer space right now.''
   Zobel works for the department's <ORGANIZATION>Agricultural Research Service</ORGANIZATION>
at its <LOCATION>Ithaca</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>, laboratory.
   One reason for lack of knowledge about the world at our feet is
that ``only recently have we had the tools to study it, and they're
still not up to the job,'' he said. ``Soil physics and chemistry,
plant biology and physiology, entomology and microbiology all
provide tools, but none of them is designed to work with more than
a single microorganism or a single plant at a time.''
   And when a scientist has to ``put all these elements together
and try to study them, it's tough,'' <PERSON>Zobel</PERSON> said. ``We need to learn
how microorganisms interact with the plant, and with each other.
Plant roots aren't all the same; they're functionally different and
have different growth patterns. Some die back every two weeks,
continually feeding the microorganisms in the soil.''
   <PERSON>Zobel</PERSON> spoke <DATE>Monday</DATE> at an annual symposium held by the agency at
<LOCATION>Beltsville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Md</LOCATION>. His remarks were included in reports issued by the
department.
   Topics in the four-day conference include genetic engineering
and some of the new technologies for investigating the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s root
zone.
   One of scientists' goals is to find ways to grow crops where
they won't grow now because the soil is too wet, dry or salty, or
has trace elements such as aluminum that can inhibit growth.
   ``But we don't have the genetic information to manipulate the
plants the way we need to do,'' <PERSON>Zobel</PERSON> said. ``A lot of that
information is below the surface of the soil. I think we're on the
edge of a major revolution here, and can begin to get handles on
these things.''
   <PERSON>Zobel</PERSON> said when scientists gain understanding of the
rhizosphere, ``a whole multitude of things'' will fall into place.
   ``For example, we could reduce chemical use on crops by knowing
what biological elements in the soil will do the same thing,'' he
said. ``That affects groundwater quality since you reduce the
chances of chemicals moving into the water.''
   And if scientists could increase the ability of microorganisms
to take nitrogen from the atmosphere and turn it into forms that
plants can use, it could mean a major reduction in fertilizer use.
   ``We're only beginning to understand that a plant has genes that
control nitrogen fixation as well as the bacteria do, so we can
manipulate the plant end, too,'' <PERSON>Zobel</PERSON> said. ``That's an awful lot
of information still to be discovered.''

   Scientists studying a disease affecting citrus
fruit inadvertently discovered two antibiotics that might be used to
treat staph infection among humans, the <ORGANIZATION>Agriculture Department</ORGANIZATION> says.
   Staph bacteria became resistant to earlier antibiotics and are
beginning to resist the current method of treatment.
   ``In lab tests, the new potent antibiotics stopped the growth of
staph bacteria,'' said <PERSON>Robert A. Baker</PERSON>, a chemist with <ORGANIZATION>USDA</ORGANIZATION>'s
<ORGANIZATION>Agricultural Research Service</ORGANIZATION>.
   He and retired colleague <PERSON>James Tatum</PERSON> discovered the compounds
after fermenting the soil-borne fungus Fusarium solani in vats.
   ``We weren't really looking for the antibiotics,'' said <PERSON>Baker</PERSON>.
``We were trying to establish a relationship between the soil fungus
and a citrus disease.''
   He said the antibiotics can be easily isolated from fermentation
broths.
   About <PERCENT>20 percent</PERCENT> to <PERCENT>40 percent</PERCENT> of all adults intermittently carry
staph bacteria on their skin, in their nose or on their clothes,
said <ORGANIZATION>Dr. Mary Young of Georgetown University Medical Center</ORGANIZATION>'s
division of infectious diseases here.
   If a carrier gets an abrasion or cut, the bacteria can attack not
only the surface skin cells, but also enter the body and cause even
more serious problems, she said.
   ``The staph organism quickly becomes resistant to antibiotics by
producing an enzyme that renders the antibiotic ineffective,'' <PERSON>Young</PERSON>
said.
   <PERSON>Baker</PERSON> said he thinks his discovery can be effective against
staph, but such testing would have to be done by pharmaceutical

<TEXT>  A Sowbugs are not usually a big problem in the garden since they prefer dead
materials. The sowbug has 14 legs and 20 protective plates that run the length
of the body, but they really don't get around very well.;   The best deterrent
is to keep the garden clean of debris and old plant materials, where sowbugs
like to take up residence.;   To keep them off the ground, place ripening
melons and pumpkins on small, elevated platforms or inverted aluminum pie
pans. Make the platform of a square of wood with 1-by-1-inch strips nailed on
the bottom. Then, place a ring of moth crystals around each melon or pumpkin
to help ward off the sowbugs and other insects. The smell is pervasive and
repels many insects. (This works with flood irrigation systems rather than
overhead sprinkling.);   Organic gardening books suggest using tobacco dust or
pyrethrum spray to hold the line if the problem is severe. An oak-leaf mulch
and wood ashes worked into the soil are two other suggestions.;   Worm-type
invaders can be controlled using Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt). New on the
market is a control for grubs and worms that reside in the soil. It is sold as
<ORGANIZATION>Biosafe</ORGANIZATION> and consists of predatory nematodes that attack the insect. Follow
directions on the label.;   Q I planted two avocado seeds and had two 8-foot
trees until the frost <DATE>last winter</DATE>. Now I have four-foot plants with multiple
suckers. Can I keep these trimmed to bush types? Will they ever bear fruit?
How long before fruiting? Do they require any special care?;   -- <LOCATION>R.W.</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Santa
Cruz</LOCATION>; A Almost any plant can be kept smaller by pruning. Avocado seedlings
will bear fruit in eight to 12 years; they will have a heavy crop in alternate
years. Depending on the variety planted they will bear <DATE>August</DATE> to <DATE>January</DATE> or
<DATE>October</DATE> to February.;   Alkaline soils are a problem for avocados. They prefer
acidic soils, with a pH of 5.5 to 6.5. Irrigate heavily every fourth watering
to flush out the salts.;   Keep the soil in the top 18 inches moist but not
soggy. Apply aluminum sulfate if leaf tips burn, a sign of excess alkalinity.
If leaves look yellowish with the veins still green it is a sign of iron
chlorosis. Treat the condition with liquid iron.;   Fertilize your trees
lightly but regularly from early <DATE>spring</DATE> to late <DATE>summer</DATE> using sulfate of
ammonia and following directions on the bag.;   Avocados bloom in clusters in
the <DATE>winter</DATE> and are self-pollinating. Normally they will take temperatures to
24 degrees without damage. If temperatures drop during blooming the crop may
be lost.;   Few pests and diseases bother avocados. Snails can be a nuisance.
Keep them out of the trees by applying bait or placing copper collars around
the trunks.;   Q What is the flower used to make Hawaiian leis and is it

<TEXT>
   Farmers soon may have an environmentally safe
alternative to pesticides _ swarms of tiny wasps trained for
search-and-destroy missions against two of the nation's most
destructive crop pests.
   Researchers at a <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Department of Agriculture</ORGANIZATION> laboratory in
<LOCATION>Tifton</LOCATION> are experimenting with odors and colors to enhance the
wasp's natural bloodhound ability to locate corn ear and tobacco
bud worms.
   The two caterpillars attack at least 100 plants, including corn,
cotton, soybeans and tomatoes. They are members of the Heliothis
pest family, blamed for more than <MONEY>$1 billion</MONEY> in crop losses each
year.
   <PERSON>Joe Lewis</PERSON>, an entomologist with the <ORGANIZATION>USDA</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Agricultural Research
Service</ORGANIZATION>, and visiting Dutch student <PERSON>Felix Wackers</PERSON> are raising small
wasps known as Microplitis croceipes. They are natural enemies of
Heliothis insects but do not harm humans.
   The Heliothis pests often try to evade the enemies by hiding in
crevices of plants and leaving decoy sites with their scents.
   ``The wasps are like detectives,'' <PERSON>Lewis</PERSON> said. ``They're
monitoring, eavesdropping. By understanding how they identify clues
that signal the caterpillar's presence, we can turn them into an
asset.''
   The female wasp deposits an egg inside the caterpillar while
stinging. The egg hatches into a larva, feeds inside the host and
eventually kills the caterpillar. The larva then leaves and spins a
cocoon in which it develops into a wasp.
   As the wasps emerge from the cocoon, the caterpillar odor left
on the cocoon is sensed by the wasp and used later to locate hosts
for its eggs, <PERSON>Lewis</PERSON> said.
   To use wasps to kill pests, large numbers will have to be raised
in laboratories. But ``if you released them in a cornfield and they
didn't have any training for worms, they might fly off to another
field,'' said <PERSON>Wackers</PERSON>.
   So the researchers are using Pavlovian techniques to make the
wasps more efficient killers. They have conditioned wasps to
recognize the odor of caterpillar feces and pick out cues such as
the color and shape of a cotton bloom.
   Wasps that received caterpillars as rewards were <PERCENT>90 percent</PERCENT>
effective in choosing the correct odors and colored cards in flight
chamber tests. Similar results were achieved when wasps were
released in small plots.
   ``We can program them to seek a certain kind of plant and a
certain part of the plant in searching for pests,'' said <PERSON>Lewis</PERSON>.
   Wasps are already used for pest control in greenhouses in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>
and the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>. It has always been assumed that insect
behavior was determined by instinct, but <PERSON>Lewis</PERSON> said his tests have
shown the wasps can be trained.
   In one experiment, he taught them to associate the smell of
vanilla with caterpillars.
   ``Our ability to train them to respond to such novel and
otherwise unattractive odors demonstrates the remarkable capacity
of these wasps to learn,'' <PERSON>Lewis</PERSON> said.
   The researchers estimate that by <DATE>1995</DATE>, parasitic wasps could be
sent out to patrol full-sized fields.

FT  28 JUL 94 / Technology: Cowpeas playing part in Aids fight - Deborah
Hargreaves on a novel approach to genetic engineering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bathed in artificial light in a sealed room at the headquarters of <ORGANIZATION>Axis
Genetics</ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION>Cambridge</LOCATION> in the <ORGANIZATION>UK</ORGANIZATION>, several humble cowpea plants are making
their contribution to the search for an Aids vaccine.
The plants are infected with a common cowpea virus, but to that virus
scientists have attached proteins containing parts of HIV, the virus
believed to cause Aids.
This virus-protein combination will later be injected into mice to see if
they produce antibodies to the virus. If this is successful, clinical trials
of the resulting vaccine could begin on humans as early as next year.
Axis Genetics is the hi-tech arm of <ORGANIZATION>Agricultural Genetics</ORGANIZATION>, a biotechnology
company which hopes to come to the UK stock market next year. 'In some ways,
this is really whacky science - there are so many different applications,'
says <PERSON>Iain Cubitt</PERSON>, Axis's managing director, of the plant viruses.
Other vaccines Axis is 'growing' in this way include a medicine for foot and
mouth disease and one for mastitis in cattle. The foot and mouth disease
treatment is currently being tested on guinea pigs with cat-
tle trials due to start next
year.
'We've chosen applications where a huge amount is known about the viruses
already and where we can grow different proteins on the plant,' <PERSON>Cubitt</PERSON> says.
The benefit of producing vaccines in this way is that the resulting
treatments are very stable and do not need to be refrigerated.
This gives them a long shelf-life making it easier to transport them to
remote places. Since one leaf can produce hundreds of doses, large amounts
of vaccines can be grown in quite a small, enclosed area.
One of the biggest problems facing the company is the lack of public
sympathy for genetic engineering. Cubitt stresses that public fears about a
'rogue' virus escaping from field trials are misplaced.
'This whole room could produce 1bn doses of HIV vaccine,' he says of the
small laboratory where the cowpea plants are growing. 'There will never be
any need to grow them in the field.'
In addition, the production process is simple: the leaves are ground up in a
solution which is then placed in a centrifuge at a very high speed to
separate the particles.
Axis, the pioneering part of the company's business, is also working with
another arm of the company, <ORGANIZATION>Cambridge Plant Breeders</ORGANIZATION>, to manipulate the
genes in crops so that they become resistant to certain pests. This
eliminates the need to use expensive pesticides.
Farmers are under increasing pressure to restrict their use of chemicals and
improve their environmental practices. This is likely to lead to increasing
demand for bio-pesticides which the company also produces.
The agrochemicals industry currently totals around Dollars 26bn a year
worldwide while organic pesticides account for less than <MONEY>1 per cent</MONEY> of that.
Analysts suggest that the bio-pesticides market could grow into sales of at
least Dollars 2bn in the next 10 years.
That would be a huge leap for many of the small biotechnology companies
involved in developing these products. But they will probably move into
alliances with the big chemicals groups such as <ORGANIZATION>Ciba</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Bayer</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Norsk Hydro</ORGANIZATION>
to distribute the products.
MicroBio, another arm of the company, has developed a way of rearing tiny
worms called nematodes, which prey on slugs - a product which has huge
applications in the gardening and agricultural markets. The product sold out
when it was released to the home and garden market earlier this year.
One reason for the planned stock market launch is to raise funds for
expansion. Agricultural Genetics' production of organic pesticides, along
with its programme of manipulating genes in crops to make the plant
resistant to certain insects, are projects which have created a lot of
interest as farmers try to cut back on their use of agrochemicals.

Many people have heard about the <ORGANIZATION>Human Genome Project</ORGANIZATION>, the <MONEY>$3-billion</MONEY>, 15-year 
effort to map the 50,000 to 100,000 genes that make up the blueprint for human 
life. It's one of the federal government's "Big Science" projects, along with 
the <MONEY>$6-billion</MONEY> Superconducting Supercollider and the <MONEY>$1.4-billion</MONEY> <ORGANIZATION>Hubble Space 
Telescope</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
But how many know about the <ORGANIZATION>Mouse Genome Project</ORGANIZATION>? Or the <ORGANIZATION>Rice Genome Project</ORGANIZATION>? 
How about the efforts to map the genes of worms, tomatoes, yeast, fruit flies, 
wheat, onions, lettuce, bacteria, or a tiny weed called Arabodopsis? 
</P>
<P>
The projects have a functional purpose: Mapping the genes of fruit flies and 
the tiny nematode worm, <PERSON>Caenorhabditis</PERSON> elegans, for example, will help 
scientists understand similar biochemical functions in humans, such as how 
vision works and how cell death occurs. Tracking rice and wheat genomes may 
keep the world's burgeoning population from famine. The mouse project, among 
other things, will help those tackling the enormous human genome project by 
validating mapping techniques. 
</P>
<P>
But the projects are also contributing to an overriding theme: that humans are 
not as different and separate from other species as they have long imagined 
themselves to be. 
</P>
<P>
"The real message is that all of life is extremely similar," said <PERSON>Tom Roderick</PERSON>, 
senior staff scientist at the <ORGANIZATION>Jackson Laboratory</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Bar Harbor</LOCATION>, Me. "We're all 
humming and moving along together -- our cells are behaving very similarly." 
</P>
<P>
Mapping various plant and animal species' genomes is the key to unraveling the 
chemical blueprint that determines the characteristics of all living organisms, 
such as resistance to a particular disease in lettuce, or the cause of a 
disease such as Alzheimer's in humans. 
</P>
<P>
Mapping a genome consists of locating landmarks or identified genes on a 
chromosome. Genetic mapping links a particular gene to a chromosome by studying 
the expression of that gene through successive generations. 
</P>
<P>
This type of mapping has been going on since <DATE>1911</DATE>, when the gene for human 
color blindness was traced through several generations of families. It was 
linked to the gene that determines female gender, and thus determined to be on 
the X chromosome. 
</P>
<P>
With the advent of recombinant technologies in the <DATE>1970s</DATE>, scientists began to 
isolate a piece of DNA -- the genetic blueprint of life -- with restriction 
enzymes that cut a specific sequence along the chain, then clone it and make 
more detailed physical maps. Physical maps use these molecular techniques to 
locate genes or identified sequences of DNA associated with genes on a 
particular part of a chromosome. 
</P>
<P>
Humans have 3 billion chemical-letter steps, or base pairs, arranged into 23 
pairs of chromosomes. On them are 50,000 to 100,000 genes. The most definitive 
mapping -- sequencing -- will identify all the base pairs in the genome in 
order, from one end of each chromosome to the other. 
</P>
<P>
The physical maps for two single-cell organisms -- baker's yeast and the 
bacteria <PERSON>Escherichia</PERSON> coli are essentially complete. In the animal kingdom, the 
nematode worm, C. elegans, is close behind, and is one of the more amazing 
projects to come out of biology. 
</P>
<P>
The story of the nematode began with <PERSON>Sydney Brenner</PERSON>, an English scientist at 
the <ORGANIZATION>Medical Research Council's Laboratory of Medical Biology</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Cambridge</LOCATION>, who 
set a goal in <DATE>1963</DATE> to know all there was to know about a many-celled animal. He 
chose a tiny transparent worm no longer than a millimeter. Three hundred can 
fit in a biologist's petri dish. Their life span is only three days. 
</P>
<P>
After nearly three decades of research, <PERSON>Brenner</PERSON> and his graduate students, who 
continued the project at their own labs, now know that this little worm has 959 
cells. Like constructing a family tree, the scientists have traced the lineage 
of each cell to the original egg cell. They have also completed a wiring 
diagram of the 302 neurons (humans have 100 billion neurons) and connections 
that make up the worm's nervous system. 
</P>
<P>
Now that the physical map is nearly complete, scientists have decided to 
sequence the worm's 100 million base pairs, with its 3,000 to 8,000 genes. When 
that is done, a project estimated to <DATE>last 10 years</DATE>, they will know more about 
this tiny worm than any other multi-celled animal. 
</P>
<P>
Having that coding information will help scientists study biological mechanisms 
in other organisms, said <PERSON>Robert Horvitz</PERSON>, professor of biology at the 
<ORGANIZATION>Massachusetts Institute of Technology</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Cambridge</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION>, who researches cell 
death. 
</P>
<P>
By identifying the series of genes involved in cell death in the worm, he will 
have more information for studying cell death in humans. "Clinically, it's very 
important," he said. "There are lots of neurodegenerative diseases where cell 
death is involved: Alzheimer's, Parkinson's. It's a very basic component of 
stroke, trauma and heart attack." 
</P>
<P>
The fruit fly, the mainstay in the study of genetics, also can provide clues to 
human functions, and the effort to map its genome began three years ago. For 
example, said <PERSON>Dan Hartl</PERSON>, head of the genetics department at <ORGANIZATION>Washington 
University School of Medicine</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>St. Louis</LOCATION>, some components of the fruit fly's 
visual system are the same in humans. "We can identify what receives light, how 
that protein signals the next protein, and how it changes to tell the organism 
that it's seen something," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The physical map of the fruit fly should be completed in two or three years, 
and then, <PERSON>Hartl</PERSON> said, it's on to sequencing. "I want to identify and sequence 
all the genes in (the fruit fly)," <PERSON>Hartl</PERSON> said. "I'm still young enough -- 47 -- 
that it will be done in my professional lifetime." 
</P>
<P>
For years, the model species for the plant world has been a weed called 
Arabodopsis, "a miserable little beast," said <PERSON>Richard Michelmore</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>UC Davis</ORGANIZATION> 
lettuce researcher. "It's the green thing you see between the cracks in the 
pavement." 
</P>
<P>
But its relatively small number of base pairs -- 70 million -- and the ability 
to grow eight to 12 life cycles a year, prompted the founding of a cooperative 
genome project this year. It is funded by the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Department of Agriculture</ORGANIZATION>, 
the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Department of Energy</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>National Institutes of Health</ORGANIZATION> and the 
<ORGANIZATION>National Science Foundation</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
A separate project -- the Plant Genome Project -- has scientists scrambling for 
the <MONEY>$11 million</MONEY> that the <ORGANIZATION>USDA</ORGANIZATION> will spread among those mapping rice, wheat, 
barley onion, corn, wheat, soybean, tomato, lettuce and "some of the smaller 
veggies," according to project director <PERSON>Jerome Miksche</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Department 
of Agriculture</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
But some scientists are not relying only on the <ORGANIZATION>USDA</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>Michelmore</PERSON>, who completed 
a map of lettuce's nine chromosomes (consisting of <MONEY>2 billion</MONEY> base pairs), 
receives part of his funding from <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> lettuce growers. He does not care 
about sequencing the entire genome. Instead, he is focusing on isolating genes 
for disease resistance, with the goal of incorporating them into lettuce crops. 
</P>
<P>
"Disease resistance is a hot topic," he said. "We don't know how it works in 
any organism." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Ray Rodriguez</PERSON>, a UC <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> genetics professor, began coordinating a 
U.S.-Japanese effort to map the rice genome <DATE>two years ago</DATE>, after he learned 
that <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> had started its own rice genome project. His primary concern in 
pushing the project is to ward off world famine. 
</P>
<P>
In the <DATE>1970s</DATE>, the worldwide production of rice, which is a primary source of 
nutrition for <PERCENT>60%</PERCENT> of the world's population and is <PERCENT>80%</PERCENT> of the caloric intake of 
<MONEY>2 billion</MONEY> Asians, accelerated as a result of the Green Revolution that spread 
the results of classical plant breeding to other countries. "Now we're in a 
race to keep up with population demand," <PERSON>Rodriguez</PERSON> said. "We're looking for 
some way to create a second Green Revolution." With the acceptance of the <ORGANIZATION>Human 
Genome Project</ORGANIZATION>, he decided the time was ripe for rice. 
</P>
<P>
Although genetic engineering of plants has been touted as a solution to feeding 
the world's future millions, it is a long-term solution, <PERSON>Rodriguez</PERSON> said, at 
least 20 years away. But the demand for rice will double within the next 20 
years. 
</P>
<P>
A short-cut is to map the genes on rice chromosomes, enabling plant breeders to 
use genetic probes to determine if desired genes, such as those for salt 
tolerance or drought resistance, have survived in offspring of cross breeding. 
</P>
<P>
The genome project most closely linked to the <ORGANIZATION>Human Genome Project</ORGANIZATION> is that of 
the mouse, which officially began on <DATE>Sept. 1</DATE>, although scientists have been 
mapping parts of mouse chromosomes for years. So much of mouse and human DNA is 
alike -- more than <PERCENT>90%</PERCENT> -- that some scientists suggest that the mouse genome be 
mapped before the human one. 
</P>
<P>
Since mice can be inbred to track genes -- something that cannot be done in 
humans -- it will be easier to develop the genetic maps more quickly. "But, for 
political reasons, the interest is in getting the human genome done," said <PERSON>Joe 
Nadeau</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Jackson Laboratory</ORGANIZATION> scientist working on the project. 
</P>
<P>
Early medical benefits from the human genome project will come from identifying 
genetic diseases and devising tests to detect those diseases in people. 
</P>
<P>
The quintessential laboratory animal model, the mouse has 20 chromosomes, with 
about the same number of base pairs and genes as humans. Many scientists study 
the mouse and the human genome together. 
</P>
<P>
That approach provides clues to molecular evolution by determining what parts 
of the DNA sequence were conserved in humans when the human and mouse trees 
separated 65 million to 70 million years ago. It also helps those looking for 
human disease genes by finding the same disease genes in the mouse first to 
figure out where to look on the human genome. 
</P>
<P>
So far, of the 2,720 loci -- genes and DNA markers associated with genes -- 
located on the mouse map and 1,884 located on the human map, 535 are the same. 
"I know there are going to be lots more," said <PERSON>Roderick</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
"It's healthy for human beings to know that we aren't somehow different and 
apart and special," <PERSON>Roderick</PERSON> said. "If you take the origin of life on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and 
make it the height of the <LOCATION>Washington Monument</LOCATION>, human beings are a postage stamp 
on top, proving we're still an experiment. To think that our special brain is 
going to keep us going isn't necessarily true. Evolution is trying out 
intelligence. It may not work." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Simple Combinations Make Up Complex Ladder of DNA 
</P>
<P>
All genes -- whether in plants or animals -- are made up of DNA -- 
deoxyribonucleic acid. DNA is made up of four chemical bases: adenine (A), 
thymine (T), cytosine (C) and guanine (G). These bases, arranged in pairs (A 
bonds with T, C bonds with G), form the steps of DNA's twisting ladder, known 
as the double helix. 
</P>
<P>
Genes are chains, or sequences, of these chemical-letter steps along the DNA. 
They code for particular proteins that perform the functions necessary for 
cells to function. In between the genes are long stretches of "junk" DNA, 
described as such because scientists don't yet know its function. The DNA in a 
cell is divided into long, thin strands called chromosomes that wind throughout 
the nucleus of a cell. During cell division, these chromosomes constrict into 
short, fat segments resembling rice grains and can be seen under a microscope. 
All the DNA in a cell's chromosomes is called a genome. 
</P>
<P>
Humans have 3 billion chemical-letter steps, or base pairs, arranged in 23 
pairs of chromosomes. On them are 50,000 to 100,000 genes. (An average gene is 
made up of about 30,000 base pairs.) Fruit flies, on the other hand, have about 
10,000 genes on 165 million base pairs arranged into four chromosomes. One 
would expect that humans, being so complex, would have more genetic material 
than any other species. They don't. Wheat has 4 billion base pairs. Pine trees 
have <MONEY>5 billion</MONEY>. Salamanders have <MONEY>90 billion</MONEY>. But all have fewer genes than 
humans.

<HEAD>Higher Domestic Demand for Rice Making Up for Export Drop</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Domestic use of rice, including large
quantities to make beer, is rising enough to take up some of the
slack caused by a drop in exports, the <ORGANIZATION>Agriculture Department</ORGANIZATION> says.
   Total <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> production, at an estimated 154.4 million
hundredweight, is about the same as last year, although yields
dropped sharply in <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION> and some other areas.
   All told, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> rice stockpile by the end of the 1990-91
marketing year next <DATE>summer</DATE> may be about 23.7 million hundredweight,
the smallest in a decade and only a fraction of the carryovers - up
to 77.6 million in <DATE>1986</DATE> - in some previous years.
   Recent supply-and-demand figures show domestic use and
``residual'' will be around 88.8 million hundredweight in <DATE>1990-91</DATE>,
up from 82.4 million last season. Residual includes unreported
uses, processing losses and statistical errors.
   Exports are projected at 73 million hundredweight, compared with
76.8 million in <DATE>1989-90</DATE> and 85.9 million in <DATE>1988-89</DATE>.
   The <DATE>December</DATE> issue of Agricultural Outlook magazine said world
rice production this year is expected to be at a record level. And
that is making export competition tougher.
   ``<LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION>, the fourth largest importer in <DATE>1989</DATE>, accounted for <PERCENT>4
percent</PERCENT> of global imports,'' the report said. ``Further, <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION> was
the largest market for <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> rice last year, taking about <PERCENT>13 percent</PERCENT>
of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> exports.''
   The analysis said the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION> embargo is expected to
reduce <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION>'s total rice imports by about <PERCENT>44 percent</PERCENT> in <DATE>1991</DATE>.
   But ``the embargo had a smaller impact on <DATE>1990</DATE> imports because
most of the rice had already been delivered before the embargo was
imposed,'' the report added.
   Rice is grown mostly in six states: <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>. <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION>, with
production estimated at 60 million hundredweight, accounts for
nearly <PERCENT>40 percent</PERCENT> of this year's crop.
   <PERSON>Martha R. Evans</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>USDA</ORGANIZATION>'s economics management staff said rice
is grown on about 12,000 farms in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and is ``the
most expensive of the major commodities to produce on a per-acre
basis. It is completely dependent on irrigation and its production
is highly mechanized.''
   Evans, writing in Farmline magazine, said rice is a major food
for more than half the world's people.
   Rice in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> was first produced in <LOCATION>Appalachia</LOCATION> and
the Southeast. After the Civil War, however, <LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>
become more competitive because they had plenty of level, fertile,
cheap land and not as many trees.
   ``Expansion continued into <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION> and eventually into
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION>,'' <PERSON>Evans</PERSON> said. ``Recently,
rice production has increased in <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>.''
   She noted the increase in rice yields, from an average of 1,144
pounds per acre in <DATE>1895</DATE> to 3,061 pounds in <DATE>1955</DATE>. This year's
harvest is estimated at 5,499 pounds per acre.

   <LOCATION>WASHINGTON</LOCATION> (AP) - Once the goal of breeding new plants was to
increase their yields of food and fiber needed for survival of the
human species. An <ORGANIZATION>Agriculture Department</ORGANIZATION> report shows how times
have changed.
   <PERSON>Henry L. Shands</PERSON> of the department's <ORGANIZATION>Agricultural Research
Service</ORGANIZATION> said in the report <DATE>Thursday</DATE> that about a hundred times a
year agency researchers release new plant varieties that have
special traits to let them thrive even if there are viruses,
bacteria, fungi, insects, bad weather and poor soils.
   Shands is the agency's national program leader for research on
germplasm - the genetic material in seeds, cuttings and live
plants.
   Even during the <DATE>1960s</DATE>, he said, the primary aim of more than
half the new plant strains released by the agency was to boost
yields. Not today.
   ``The research strives to customize a crop to withstand
diseases, pests and environmental stresses such as drought, while
preserving traits for high yield,'' <ORGANIZATION>Shands</ORGANIZATION> said.
   In a five-year period, <DATE>1984</DATE> to <DATE>1989</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>USDA</ORGANIZATION> research agency
made 599 germplasm releases that had improved resistance to some
pest or disease.
   ``These releases consisted of 147 actual plant varieties and 452
germplasm lines - strains of plants with useful traits that
breeders can transfer into existing varieties,'' he said.
   Approximately <PERCENT>80 percent</PERCENT> of the releases over the five years had
improved disease resistance, <PERCENT>30 percent</PERCENT> had improved insect
resistance and about <PERCENT>10 percent</PERCENT> had improved resistance to
nematodes, tiny worms in soil.
   Some releases contained more than one kind of resistance, which
<ORGANIZATION>Shands</ORGANIZATION> said pushed the total to mcent.
   The current <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> germplasm collections include nearly 400,000
plant introductions, cultivars and germplasm releases, he said. The
core than 100 perollections are a source of a steady supply of new crop
varieties.
   ``In the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> alone, farmers grow more than 200
varieties of wheat, 85 varieties of cotton, 200 varieties of
soybeans and many kinds of fruit, vegetables and ornamental
crops,'' <PERSON>Shands</PERSON> said. ``Disease and pest resistance must be bred
into each of these varieties, which often thrive only in specific
growing areas.''

   <LOCATION>WASHINGTON</LOCATION> (AP) - The <ORGANIZATION>Agriculture Department</ORGANIZATION> says farmers who
participated in the <DATE>1990</DATE> wheat, barley and oats program will
receive more than <MONEY>$1.7 billion</MONEY> in cash payments.
   <PERSON>Keith Bjerke</PERSON>, executive vice president of the department's
<ORGANIZATION>Commodity Credit Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, said <DATE>Thursday</DATE> that the subsidies would be
paid by county (AP) - As President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> nears the end of his
South American tour, he is encouraged by the promised release of
hostages from <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Kuwait</LOCATION> but says this is no time to relax
military pressure on <PERSON>Saddam Hussein</PERSON>.
   After concluding a 24-hour visit to <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> was heading
today for <LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION>, a longtime <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> friend and major oil producer
and the last stop on his five-nation swing to promote democracy and
free trade.
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> has praised <LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION> for increasing oil production after
<LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION>'s invasion of <LOCATION>Kuwait</LOCATION>. The Venezuelan move has helped to ease
inflation in world oil prices.
   The price of oil has fluctuated wildly since <DATE>August</DATE>, rising when
<LOCATION>Persian Gulf</LOCATION> tensions increased and receding when peace prospects
seemed to improve. Venezuelan President <PERSON>Carlos Andres Peres</PERSON> has
called for talks among consumers and producers to see if a way can
be found to stabilize prices.
   Officials said <LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION> advocates creation of a hemispheric oil
reserve for emergencies, but that the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> has so far
shown little interest in the idea.
   In <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>, there was a spate of bombings and anti-Bush
demonstrations <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, but the overall reception seemed friendly.
Presidential spokesman <PERSON>Marlin Fitzwater</PERSON> called the welcome
``terrific.''
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> hailed <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>'s return to the democratic fold in <DATE>March</DATE> and
praised the government for a reform policy that has led to a surge
in economic growth.
   Once again, the gulf crisis intruded on <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s activities
<DATE>Thursday</DATE>. He was flying to <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION> from <PERSON>Buenos Aires</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>, when
word came of the prospective release of about 900 American
hostages. Fitzwater called the Iraqi announcement ``a hopeful
sign.''
   Release of the hostages has been a key demand of the <LOCATION>United
States</LOCATION> and the global coalition against <ORGANIZATION>Iraq</ORGANIZATION>, along with the
withdrawal of Iraqi troops from <LOCATION>Kuwait</LOCATION>, the restoration of the
exiled emir and a guarantee of security in the gulf.
   But, at a news conference <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> said <PERSON>Saddam</PERSON>'s show of
flexibility will not affect his gulf policy. <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> said <PERSON>Saddam</PERSON>
``must leave <LOCATION>Kuwait</LOCATION> without reservation, without condition.''
   ``We've got to continue to keep the pressure on,'' said <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>,
who has authorized the deployment of more than 400,000 Americans to
the gulf.
   The president promised there would not be any secret deal with
<PERSON>Saddam</PERSON> to end the gulf crisis. ``There are no secret negotiations,
direct or indirect with <ORGANIZATION>Iraq</ORGANIZATION> over this question,'' he said. ``None.
And there will be none.''
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s Chilean visit was the first by an American president in
30 years. The welcome was not uniformly friendly.
   Before <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> arrived, the guerrillas exploded a half-dozen bombs
overnight at sites with <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> ties, including four Mormon chapels, a
new McDonald's restaurant and a downtown park outside a hotel where
some officials in <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s advance party were staying.
   The president's limousine was hit by an egg thrown from the
crowd as his motorcade passed through <LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION> streets. Police
reported no injuries.
   Police used tear gas and water cannon to scatter scores of
university students who staged an anti-Bush protest at a campus in
the southern section of the city. The students threw rocks at
police and blocked traffic for two hours in front of the campus.
They burned at least two <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> flags and waved several Cuban flags.
   Later, shortly before <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s arrival for a dinner at the
presidential palace, police dispersed demonstrators who were
shouting anti-American slogans.
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> also visited <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Uruguay</LOCATION>, and he returns to
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> <DATE>Saturday</DATE>.

<LEADPARA>  TOMATOES are a good example of the advantages of hybridizing. Many diseases
that for years have plagued these South American natives when grown in North
American gardens have been curbed through cross-fertilization and careful
breeding programs.;    The result is that, with a few exceptions, today's
hybrid tomatoes are remarkably easy to grow and maintain. Such hybrid vigor
undoubtedly has been a factor in making the tomato America's most popular
garden crop.  </LEADPARA>

TOMATOES REVISITED  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Update  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     There are, of course, many non-hybrids on the market. Some remain because
they have proven themselves to be inherently disease resistant, others because
the quality of plant or fruit is worth the risk of disease.;    Then there is
the large category of non-hybrids reappearing in response to the increased
interest in antique or heirloom varieties.;    Unless you are willing to risk
losing plants for the experience of growing some unusual varieties, it is wise
to stick with hybrids -- Big Boy, Big Girl, Better Boy, <ORGANIZATION>Celebrity</ORGANIZATION>,
<LOCATION>Floramerica</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Roma</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Supersteak</LOCATION>, to name a few -- or non-hybrids that have
disease resistance.;    Look for the letters;  A series of letters following
the varietal name on seed packets and in catalogs designates which diseases
the variety resists. Roma <ORGANIZATION>VF</ORGANIZATION>, for example, means that <ORGANIZATION>Roma</ORGANIZATION> is resistant to
fusarium wilt and verticillium wilt.;    Other tomato diseases that have been
reduced through breeding include tobacco mosaic (tomatoes are in the same
family as tobacco), identified by the letter T; crown wilt, A (for its
scientific name, <LOCATION>Alternaria</LOCATION>); nematodes, N; and gray leaf spot, <ORGANIZATION>ST</ORGANIZATION>
(Stemphyllium). Symbols vary somewhat among seed brand names, so it is wise to
check legends.;    Diseases endure;  Diseases that have not yet been foiled
through breeding include early and late blights, septoria leaf spot and
blossom-end rot. Blossom-end rot is caused by environmental conditions that
can be corrected by the gardener.;    Few tomato varieties, even the modern
ones, are resistant to some insect pests that inhabit many area gardens in the
summer.;    (check) Blossom-end rot. This annoying disease is characterized by
a soft, discolored circle on the skin of the tomato on the side that
originally held the blossom when the fruit is first formed.;    To gardeners
unfamiliar with the condition, it does not become evident until the circle has
enlarged to perhaps <PERCENT>25 percent</PERCENT> of the skin surface and the color has
blackened. By the time the tomato has fully ripened, it is lost to the
disease, which penetrates through the flesh, making the entire fruit
inedible.;    One condition conducive to blossom-end rot is uneven moisture in
the soil: watering, followed by long dry periods. The root of the
blossom-end-rot problem is calcium deficiency in the plant, a predicament
brought on by erratic water intake. In order to absorb calcium, the plant
needs water too.;    About the only thing a gardener can do is try to ensure
that the soil around tomato plants stays moist at all times. Individual
watering -- at the rate of about five gallons per week per plant -- plus deep
organic mulches will help maintain that moisture.;    (check) Tomato hornworm.
This is a fearsome creature, four or five inches long at maturity and as big
around as a gardener's thumb, an exquisite lime green studded with small black
and yellow dots and brandishing a curved red hook at one end -- hence its
name. The hornworm's appetite is mighty and its effect on tomato plants
potentially catastrophic. Fortunately it is not difficult to control.;    Its
large size should make the hornworm visible, but its coloration blends
perfectly with surrounding foliage. Look for it where you see maximum leaf
damage. The pest will eat entire leaves down to their spine, generally
preferring the topmost growth of the plants.;    Hand pick and drop the
caterpillars into soapy water. Or spray with Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), sold
under that name in powder or liquid form. Bt is a bacteria that affects only
such soft-bodied larvae as the hornworm and other caterpillars; it is safe for
all other life forms.;    If you see hornworms sporting white bumps on their
backs that look like upright <PERSON>Rice Krispies</PERSON>, leave these alone. They are being
parasitized by a wasp whose own larvae hatch from those eggs and eat their
host.  </TEXT>

   Exports of essential oils _ the kind that
smell and taste good _ rose to an all-time high last year, says the
<ORGANIZATION>Agriculture Department</ORGANIZATION>.
   Last year's exports of essential oils reached nearly <MONEY>$144
million</MONEY> _ a <PERCENT>17 percent</PERCENT> increase over a year earlier and well above
<DATE>1987</DATE> exports of <MONEY>$114 million</MONEY>, according to an annual report.
   Essential oils are obtained from natural raw materials by
distillation or through a mechanical pressing process. The oils are
widely used in perfumes, cosmetics and pharmaceutical products, and
to flavor food and soft drinks.
   ``As income levels in foreign countries increase, certainly the
markets there will have an increase of these export items,'' says
<PERSON>Rex Dull</PERSON> of the deparment's Horticultural and <ORGANIZATION>Tropical Products
Division</ORGANIZATION>. ``Countries are utilizing more of them in their
confectionary products, and markets for them are growing rapidly in
these countries.''
   In fact, exports of peppermint oils increased by <PERCENT>22 percent</PERCENT> to
1,510 tons, with <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> replacing the <LOCATION>United Kingdom</LOCATION> as this
countries largest export market for these oils. <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> exports of
orange oil were up <PERCENT>61 percent</PERCENT>, nearly doubling in value to <MONEY>$10.2
million</MONEY>. Lemon exports also doubled year-earlier levels, largely
reflecting increased sales to <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>United Kingdom</LOCATION>.
   While exports of most essential oils increased, <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> imports of
the same products fell <PERCENT>12 percent</PERCENT> from <DATE>1988</DATE> to <MONEY>$132 million</MONEY>. The
decline largely reflecting smaller imports of sandalwood, vetiver,
nutmeg, geranium and cassia oils, and good crop yields by <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
farmers.
   Peppermint yields in <LOCATION>Midwest</LOCATION> producing areas were well above the
drought-damaged levels in <DATE>1988</DATE> and prices have fallen accordingly.
But demand for peppermint oil continues strong, which has kept
prices from falling further, despite the large <DATE>1989</DATE> harvest and
prospects of another good outturn this year.
   Reversing a trend dating back to the <DATE>1960</DATE>'s, consumers now favor
natural flavorings over synthetic ingredients. Dull, in a telephone
interview <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, attributed this trend to the changing health
habits of consumers.
   ``In recent years, people have become more health conscious and
want to move toward consuming more natural flavored products,'' he
said. ``People are afraid of what artificial flavoring will do to
their bodies.''
   Industry studies estimate that natural flavors now comprise
three-fourths of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> market and artificial flavors the
balance, whereas the reverse was true in the <DATE>1960</DATE>'s.

<FP=106> [Article by <PERSON>V. P. Borovaya</PERSON>, director, <ORGANIZATION>Biota </F>
Scientific-Production Association</ORGANIZATION>] 
  [Text] An interfarm biological laboratory was organized in 
<DATE>1990</DATE> in <LOCATION>Leningradskiy Rayon</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Krasnodar Kray</PERSON> at the 
<ORGANIZATION>Leningradskoye APO</ORGANIZATION> [<ORGANIZATION>Agricultural Production Association</ORGANIZATION>?]. 
Besides producing biological agents, its has been ordered to 
reveal the most dangerous pests and diseases of agricultural 
crops, to draw maps of their occurrence at farms, and to develop 
the methods of effective use of different microbiological 
preparations and monitoring the quality of biological agents 
delivered to the rayon's farms. The <ORGANIZATION>Northern Caucasian 
Scientific Research Institute of Phytopathology</ORGANIZATION> provided 
technical and methodological assistance to the laboratory in all 
of these years. 
  In the stage of initial development, our main goal was to 
establish a collective of like-minded individuals capable of 
organizing production of biological agents in the shortest time 
possible, and to unite farm agronomists around the idea of 
ecologically compatible plant protection. We believe we were 
able to solve this problem successfully. The biolaboratory, 
which has become part of the <ORGANIZATION>Biota Scientific-Production 
Association</ORGANIZATION>, currently employs 12 persons, including Doctor of 
Biological Sciences <PERSON>T. S. Ivanova</PERSON> (a nematologist), Candidate of 
Biological Sciences <PERSON>A. P. Luda</PERSON> (a microbiologist), five highly 
qualified specialists with a higher biological and agricultural 
education, and four laboratory technicians. 
  The laboratory has equipment making it possible to produce 
microbiological preparations such as rizoplan, bitoksibatsillin, 
lepidotsid, baktofit, preparation-2 and trichodermin, and 
preparations based on predatory nematodes. 
  The first lots of bacterial and fungal preparations were 
produced in <DATE>May 1991</DATE> according to procedures introduced at the 
SK NIIF [not further identified]. In addition the laboratory's 
associates underwent apprenticeship at the <ORGANIZATION>All-Union Scientific 
Research Institute of Applied Microbiology</ORGANIZATION> (<LOCATION>Obolensk</LOCATION>), where 
they mastered the methods of producing and using several 
microbiological preparations. A highly active strain of 
Trichoderma was revealed independently. It is now 
being used in greenhouses of Leningradskiy Rayon to control root 
rot. The laboratory is also developing preparative forms of 
biological resources based on entomopathogenic nematodes that 
are highly effective (<PERCENT>70-95 percent</PERCENT>) against wireworms and 
potato moths. A total of 7,200 liters of biological preparations 
were produced in <DATE>9 months of 1992</DATE>. 
  During the time that the scientific and practical directions 
of the laboratory's work were forming and it was financed out of 
the budget of the <ORGANIZATION>Leningradskoye APO</ORGANIZATION>, its activity moved along 
quite briskly. But the situation changed after transition to 
full cost accounting. Difficulties typical of not just our 
enterprise alone came into being. An acute need arose for 
increasing production volume and fitting out the laboratory with 
highly productive equipment (primarily fermenters of different 
capacities), for erecting a separate production building, a 
boiler plant and so on, and for solving a number of public 
health problems. All of this requires considerable resources! 
Realizing the concept of low-volume microbiological production 
will doubtlessly require investors. 
  The problems of supplying laboratories with strains of 
industrial microorganisms satisfying all of the requirements of 
modern production, and of organizing advanced training courses 
for laboratory associates, have not been solved. 
  There is a problem in keeping personnel employed year-round. 
Everyone is busy in <DATE>spring</DATE> and <DATE>summer</DATE>, but in fall and winter 
the few greenhouse complexes are unable to keep our work 
profitable. We are looking for things for the people to 
do--perhaps producing yeast for food industry, feed additives, 
silage leaven for animal husbandry, and biologically produced 
humus. 
  We would be interested in knowing how other collectives are 
solving these problems.

<HEAD>Seed Treatment Being Developed For Corn Borers; Still 2 Years Away</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN P. ROSENFELD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Agricultural researchers in <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION> are
reporting some success in using seeds pretreated with an
insecticide to fight European corn borers, pests the government
estimates cost <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> farmers <MONEY>$400 million</MONEY> a year in damage and
control expenses.
   Pretreating seeds with a thiodicarb solution before planting has
been found as effective in controlling corn borers as any spray now
on the market, yet is more economical and appears to be safer to
the environment, said <PERSON>Edwin C. Berry</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Department of
Agriculture</ORGANIZATION>'s Corn Insects Lab in <LOCATION>Ankeny</LOCATION>.
   But the process isn't ready for farm use yet.
   <PERSON>Berry</PERSON> said the treatment is in its third year of tests and that
another year of research is planned.
   ``We're interested in learning why it is effective in some
hybrids and not in others,'' he said.
   <PERSON>Berry</PERSON> also said researchers want to know if the mechanical
action of mixing the seeds with the chemical solution affects seed
quality or influences the action of insecticides.
   In addition, the chemical seed treatment has yet to be approved
for commercial use by the <ORGANIZATION>Environmental Protection Agency</ORGANIZATION> and its
<LOCATION>Des Moines</LOCATION> developer, <ORGANIZATION>Gustafson Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, says the process is still two
years away from the marketplace.
   Researchers also have been experimenting with natural controls
of corn borers through the interaction of an insect, the green
lacewing; and a microbe, Nosema pyrausta.
   The lacewing eats corn borer eggs and larvae, and the
microorganism infects larvae and borer eggs with a disease that is
fatal to the borer and most other insects, but not the lacewing,
according to the <ORGANIZATION>USDA</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``Because most insecticides that kill the corn borer indirectly
kill the microorganism, researchers will try next to determine how
farmers can maintain natural Nosema pyrausta populations with
tilling practices, crop management and less pesticide,'' the
<ORGANIZATION>Agricultural Research Service</ORGANIZATION> reports.
   In the seed treatment, seeds are mechanically tumbled in a
solution of the insecticide thiodicarb before planting.
   As the corn grows, the chemical is absorbed throughout the
plant's stalks and leaves and the insect feeding on the plant dies,
<PERSON>Berry</PERSON> says.
   Corn borers cause their crop damage in their worm or larvae
stage before maturing to adult moths. There are two to three
generations to each growing season, according to <PERSON>Berry</PERSON>.
   The larvae enters the plant and causes damage by eating through
conductive tissues, interrupting the flow of nutrients. If it
enters a corn stalk or ear, it weakens the plant and makes it
susceptible to wind damage.
   Because the insect is on the plant's surface for only a short
period of time before tunneling, it is especially difficult to
combat with a spray, says <PERSON>Berry</PERSON>.
   ``This is why a systematic or seed treatment is so
encouraging,'' he says.
   Thiodicarb already is being used as a corn rootworm insecticide
that is sprayed just before insect infestation, and <PERSON>Berry</PERSON> said it
was routinely evaluated as part of research attempts to find
materials that are environmentally safer and more effective.
   Through early tests, researchers found the lowest concentrations
of chemicals that proved effective against corn borers.
   ``Depending on the strain of corn, we can achieve as good a
control with seed treatment as with conventional technology and it
is more economical,'' <PERSON>Berry</PERSON> said, controlling <PERCENT>70 percent</PERCENT> to <PERCENT>80
percent</PERCENT> of the insect population. He also said the seed treatment
puts less pesticide in the environment and has no known side
effects.
   In spraying, <PERCENT>80 percent</PERCENT> of the insecticide misses the target
area, he said.
   <PERSON>Ray Knake</PERSON>, northern regional manager for research and
development for <PERSON>Gustafson</PERSON>, said his company is developing the
chemical for seed treatment use for the international company
<ORGANIZATION>Rhone-Poulenc</ORGANIZATION>, which is registering such use of thiodicarb with the
<ORGANIZATION>EPA</ORGANIZATION>.
   He estimated the treatment would cost farmers a couple of
dollars an acre.
   <PERSON>Knake</PERSON> said a simple mixer is being developed for farm use so
that farmers need not come in contact with the chemical while
treating seeds. He says the chemical breaks down so rapidly in the
soil that it is environmentally safe.
   While many details need to be worked out, <PERSON>Gustafson</PERSON> anticipates
selling the insecticide for on-farm treatment, leaving it up to
farmers to decide how much of their seed to treat and saving seed
companies from investing in large stocks of treated seeds, <PERSON>Knake</PERSON>
says.

   An apple a day really might keep the doctor
away _ especially if the doctor knew what went on it.
   If fruit were labele the label on apples
would list fiber, potassium and vitamin C _ all of which are good
for you. It also might list azinphis methyl, Captan, Supracide,
parathion, <LOCATION>Elgetol</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Sevin</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>NAA</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>NAD</ORGANIZATION>, Ziram, diphenylamine, <LOCATION>Lorsban</LOCATION>
and benzimidazole.
   These might not be so good, but they're among the dozens of
chemicals routinely used to bring apples from fruit trees to fruit
bowls.
   Without some of them, according to <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> apple grower
<PERSON>John Rice</PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>International Apple Institute</ORGANIZATION>, ``People
would have to get used to biting into an apple and seeing a whole
or half a worm.''
   Probably the best-known of these chemicals right now is Alar,
the market name for daminozide, which helps apples ripen, extends
shelf life and prevents bruising. Many schools pulled apples from
their lunchrooms this month after the <ORGANIZATION>Natural Res
Council</ORGANIZATION> said Alar increased the risk of cancer among children,
whose diet contains proportionally more fruit than adults.
   Most schools let apples back in after the claim was disputed by
regulators, <ORGANIZATION>Uniroyal Chemical Co.</ORGANIZATION> and the industry, which cut its
use of Alar to <PERCENT>5 percent</PERCENT> of the <MONEY>$1.2 billion-a-year</MONEY> crop since
concerns were first raised in <DATE>1985</DATE>.
   But dozens of other chemicals are routinely used, and the <ORGANIZATION>NRDC</ORGANIZATION>
considers several of them to be cancer-causing even though, like
Alar, they are legal.
   A recent <PERSON>Louis Harris</PERSON> Poll found that <PERCENT>84.2 percent</PERCENT> of Americans
would choose organically grown food if given the choice. But <PERSON>Rice</PERSON>
said that without the chemicals, an apple ``would be a rather
small, gnarled (object) that kind of resembled an apple. It would
be covered with a black fungus scab, infested with various decay
molds which could have natural carcinogens. It would undoubtedly
have codling bud moths and other types of larvae.''
   <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>'s 5,000 growers, who produce about half the nation's
apples, spend an average <MONEY>$449</MONEY> per acre to buy and apply chemicals
each year, said <PERSON>Brooke Peterson</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Washington State University</ORGANIZATION> tree
fruit extension agent.
   Many of the chemicals have been identified as harmful to childen
by the <ORGANIZATION>NRDC</ORGANIZATION> report, which studied chemical residues on food. But
those findings are in dispute, and the <ORGANIZATION>Food and Drug
Administration</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Environmental Protection Agency</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Department of
Agriculture</ORGANIZATION> and Surgeon General have all said apples are safe.
   Here is a typical chemical season for <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> apples:
   In early <DATE>April</DATE>, before bloom, an organophosphate spray _
Supracide, <LOCATION>Lorsban</LOCATION> or parathion _ kills the eggs of European red
mites and also controls the spread of <ORGANIZATION>San Jose Scale</ORGANIZATION>, a pest which
can kill trees.
   In <DATE>May</DATE>, growers will apply Guthion, the marketing name for
azinphis methyl, an insecticide that kills the codling moth larva,
which produces worms in apples and is the most damaging pest in the
orchard.
   Also applied at bloom time is Elgetol, a ``thinner'' that burns
off some of the flowers, reducing the number of apples a tree will
bear. Untreated trees will produce huge crops one year and tiny
ones the next to conserve energy. Another thinner is <PERSON>Sevin</PERSON>, an
insecticide made from the chemical carbarylaced Alar as a ``stop-drop,''
which
farmers would spray about a month after bloom to keep apples on
trees; an apple on the ground is worthless. <ORGANIZATION>NAA</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>NAD</ORGANIZATION> are less
effective, and there is no substitute for Alar's ability to extend
shelf life, <PERSON>Peterson</PERSON> said.
   Ziram or Captan, fungicides used to battle bull's eye rot, also
are applied at this time.
   In warehouses, the apples are rinsed, washed with detergent,
rinsed again, sometimes waxed, dried and placed in boxes for
shipment.
   Those destined for storage for three months to a year might be
treated with two chemicals. One is benzimidazole, a fungicide; the
other is diphenylamine, which prevents the red skin from turning
brown.

   What would have happened if the spider had poisoned Miss
Muffett's curds and whey? Some crop-destroying caterpillars
are about to find out.
   A small Salt Lake City biotechnology company, funded by
FMC Corp., reported its genetic engineers had plucked a
poisonproducing gene from a spider and inserted it into a
virus that infects pesty caterpillars. When the caterpillar
swallows the virus it infects the creature's own cells with
the spider gene. The infected cells essentially poison
themselves, thereby killing the caterpillar.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Both the virus and the spider gene are harmless to plants
and animals other than caterpillars, the company said.
   The feat was announced by <ORGANIZATION>Natural Products Sciences Inc</ORGANIZATION>.
Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION>FMC</ORGANIZATION> has exclusive marketing rights to any
commercial product that exploits the research.
   <ORGANIZATION>FMC</ORGANIZATION> is planning to approach the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency</ORGANIZATION> to see what data the agency will require to
approve a field test of the new pesticide, said <PERSON>William Van
Saun</PERSON>, director of discovery research at the company's
laboratories in <LOCATION>Princeton</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION>FMC</ORGANIZATION> is a major producer of
chemical pesticides but "we look at this as an opportunity to
get into agricultural pest control using biopesticides," <PERSON>Dr.
Van Saun</PERSON> said.
   The <ORGANIZATION>NPS</ORGANIZATION> researchers are the latest to report successful
first steps toward a new kind of biological insecticide that
scientists hope eventually will be harmless replacements for
the more hazardous chemical insecticides currently used.
Within the past seven months, three other research teams
reported they are pursuing the same idea of inserting a
poison gene into caterpillar-infecting viruses.
   All the researchers are using a virus that infects only
the larvae, or caterpillars, of a variety of moths. These
viruses kill the worms they infect but do so rather slowly,
taking as long as a week from infection to death, during
which time the insects can do a lot of damage to a crop.
   By adding a poison-making gene to the viruses, the
researchers hope to make insecticides that work faster than
the natural viruses. Their research differs mainly in the
type of toxin-making gene that is transplanted to the virus.
   An entomologist and a geneticist at the <ORGANIZATION>University of
Georgia</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Athens</LOCATION> reported last <DATE>July</DATE> that they had taken a
poison-producing gene from a mite that kills insects and
inserted the gene into the caterpillarinfecting virus. The
mite toxin causes muscle contraction and paralysis in a broad
range of insects but tests showed it was harmless to mice.
   Two other research teams reported they had taken a
toxin-making gene from a scorpion and put it into the
caterpillar-infecting virus, cutting the time to kill half
the bugs to 88 hours from 125 hours for the natural virus.
One research team to use the scorpion toxin gene is at the
<ORGANIZATION>NERC Institute of Virology and Environmental Microbiology</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Oxford</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>. The other team is at the <ORGANIZATION>University of
California</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Davis</PERSON>, which is working with researchers at a
unit of <ORGANIZATION>Ciba-Geigy Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Switzerland</LOCATION>.

  [Summary] Although <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> has attained significant 
achievements in controlling malaria, schistosomiasis, 
filariasis, and black fever, not much has been studied on the 
scope of distribution, rules of spreading, degrees of damage of 
the more harmful parasites. In <DATE>1986</DATE> the <ORGANIZATION>Ministry of Public 
Health</ORGANIZATION> launched on unprecedented large-scale study on parasitic 
infection. According to the report given in the "National Survey 
on Distribution of Human Parasites," <PERCENT>62.6 percent</PERCENT> of Chinese 
people are infected with 56 kinds of parasites, among them, 19 
are protozoa, 16 flukes, 12 nematodes (eelworms), eight cestodes 
(tapeworms), and one thornheaded worm. The <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION> thornbelt 
fluke found in <LOCATION>Fujian</LOCATION>, tiny spinous fluke and narrow testis 
thornmouth fluke found in <LOCATION>Anhui</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Fujian</LOCATION>, are the two first 
time-reported parasites, and the <LOCATION>Fujian</LOCATION> spinous fluke is a 
newly-discovered species in <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>. There are more unidentified 
newly-discovered parasites found in every province. According to 
the report, among 147,7742 [as printed] people surveyed, <PERCENT>10.315 
percent</PERCENT> are infected with protozoa, <PERCENT>0.573 percent</PERCENT> with flukes, 
<PERCENT>0.195 percent</PERCENT> with cestodes, <PERCENT>59.022 percent</PERCENT> with nematodes, and 
<PERCENT>43.33 percent</PERCENT> of the surveyed population are cross-infected with 
two or more kinds of parasites, some are even infected with nine 
kinds of parasites. Some children under five years old are 
already infected with six kinds of parasites. Higher roundworm 
(<PERCENT>46.999 percent</PERCENT>), hookworm (17.166 percent) and whipworm (<PERCENT>18.796 
percent</PERCENT>) infections are also reported in the above surveyed 
population. The data indicate that in <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>, by estimate, about 
531 million people are infected with roundworms, 194 million 
with hookworms, and 212 million with whipworms.

<HEAD>Doctors Say Intestinal Worm Illness Confused with Appendicitis</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Raw or undercooked fish such as sushi can cause a
serious intestinal illness often mistaken for appendicitis, doctors
warned today.
   The disease, anisakiasis, is caused by eating fish infested with
larvae of worms known as anisakid nematodes. Cooking kills the worms.
   The doctors said about 50 cases of aniskaiasis have been reported
in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, but ``this may be the tip of the iceberg.''
   Drs. <PERSON>James H. McKerrow</PERSON> and <PERSON>Judy Sakanari</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>University of
California</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, and <PERSON>Thomas L. Deardorff</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Food
and Drug Administration</ORGANIZATION> described the infection in a letter in
today's New England Journal of Medicine.
   The doctors said the emergence of the disease was partly due to
the popularity of sushi and sashimi and lightly cooked fish. Salmon
and pacific snapper are most commonly implicated in the disease.
   Another factor, they said, is the increasing number of seals, sea
lions, and other marine mammals that harbor the parasites in their
stomachs. The animals expel worm eggs in their feces, which are then
eaten by other sea creatures, including fish.
   People who eat wormy fish sometimes cough up live worms or feel
the worm in their throats, a condition known as ``tingling throat
syndrome.''
   In more serious cases, the worms burrow into the wall of the
stomach or the intestines. They are removed by a tube that is pushed
into the digestive system.

  [Text] Abstract. The principal clinical symptoms in 
patients and epidemiological characteristics are described in 
the article. 
  The authors of this report observed four patients, three of 
whom were identified in <LOCATION>Pavlodar</LOCATION> and one in <LOCATION>Uralsk</LOCATION>. 
  Helminths (Dirofilaria repens) belong to the 
genera of Nematodes and Nemathelminthes and have the dimensions 
of 100 to 110 x 0.2 mm and, as a rule, parasitize in nodular 
intumescence under the skin, subcutaneous fat, and the eye. 
  The larva migrans cutanea phenomenon, i.e., a 
parasite movement over substantial distances under the skin, has 
been recorded. 
  Dirofilarioses are transmissive helminths. Humans are 
infected with them in the locations where invaded animals 
proliferate (dogs, foxes, wolves, etc.) through mosquito bites. 
References: 4. 
  Key words: Parasitism--A form of cohabitation of two 
organisms advantageous for one and harmful for the other 
species; filaria--several species of white filamentary 
helminths; <LOCATION>Dirofilaria</LOCATION>--one of the filaria species; larva 
migrans cutanea phenomenon--parasite movement over a 
considerable distance under the skin; transmissible 
diseases--diseases whose etiological agents are transmitted by 
vectors. 
  Several dozen cases of parasitizing of animal filaria in 
humans identified as Dirofilaria have been recorded in the 
world, including the <ORGANIZATION>CIS</ORGANIZATION>. Moreover, single, usually sexually 
immature female and less frequently, male filaria have been 
detected in the organism of most patients. Helminths, as a rule, 
parasitize in nodular subcutaneous intumescence, subcutaneous 
fat, and the eye. 
  Filaria have been found in people living in the territories 
with subtropical and moderate continental climate. Cases of 
Dirofilaria have been described in the maritime kray [3] and 
<LOCATION>Turkmenia</LOCATION> [2]. In <LOCATION>Kazakhstan</LOCATION>, the first cases of local 
Dirofilarioses infestation were described by <PERSON>T.K. Besedina</PERSON> and 
<ORGANIZATION>N.A. Khokholnikova</ORGANIZATION> [1]. Both cases were identified in <LOCATION>Alma-Ata</LOCATION> 
in <DATE>1960-1961</DATE>, and in the author's opinion, the southern 
<LOCATION>Kazakhstan</LOCATION> and Urals oblasts are regarded as likely infestation 
areas [4]. The latter two Dirofilarioses cases were recorded in 
<LOCATION>Kzyl-Orda</LOCATION> in <DATE>1964</DATE> and <DATE>1968</DATE>. 
  The authors of this report have observed four Dirofilariosis 
patients in the last six months. Due to the increased frequency 
of the rare helminthism occurrence on the republic territory, it 
would be interesting to examine the principal climatic symptoms 
on invasion among the patients, especially its epidemiology. 
  Patient B, born in <DATE>1940</DATE>, is a biology teacher in a Pavlodar 
secondary school. She fell acutely ill on <DATE>19 Mar 90</DATE>, felt a 
sharp pain and an edema of the left eye. For several days prior 
to that, she experienced headaches every evening. On 20 <DATE>Mar 90</DATE>, 
she sought medical help at a trauma center of the oblast 
hospital where a filamentary helminth with a 110 x 0.2 mm size 
was removed from under the mucous membrane of the eyeball. 
  Patient S, born in <DATE>1954</DATE>, is a designer engineer working in 
<LOCATION>Pavlodar</LOCATION>. A hyperemic spot which, with time, transformed into a 
1 x 5 mm node, appeared in the left groin area. The larva 
migrans phenomenon, i.e., a parasite movement over a 
considerable distance under the skin, was detected. The process 
was accompanied by pain in the elbow and radiocarpal joints and 
an edema of the tongue. 
  On 25 <DATE>Sep 90</DATE>, a 110 x 0.2 mm nematode was pulled from under 
the eyeball mucous membrane. 
  Patient P, a retiree born in <DATE>1930</DATE>, is also a resident of 
Pavlodar. She fell ill in late <DATE>February 1992</DATE> when she noted a 
hyperemic tumor-like formation on the forehead. She was bothered 
by severe headaches. The tumor disappeared several days later. 
On 8 <DATE>March</DATE>, she had sharp pain in the right eye and developed 
photophobia and lacrimation. On 20 <DATE>March</DATE>, a 106 x 0.2 mm 
nematode was removed from under the eyeball mucous membrane at 
the eye department of the oblast hospital. 
  Patient M from <LOCATION>Uralsk</LOCATION> is a retiree. In <DATE>February 1992</DATE>, she 
noted an edema on the front of the right crus and a 
zigzag-shaped reddening as well as pain in the area of the knee 
joint. Some time later, the reddening moved lower, and a 
pea-sized tumor appeared on the rear surface of the right crus. 
The movement of the reddening was accompanied by itching. After 
self-treatment of the tumor with Vishnevskiy ointment, no 
recovery was noted. After she sought medical assistance, the 
tumor was operated on, and a white 110-mm-long nematode was 
pulled from the purulent wound. 
  All patients recall numerous mosquito bites during the 
<DATE>summer</DATE> 
and none left <LOCATION>Kazakhstan</LOCATION>. The helminths extracted from them were 
sent to the republican sanitary and epidemiological station for 
identification; they are encapsulated preadolescent males 
belonging to the Dirofilaria repens species. 
  Dirofilarioses are transmissible helminthisms. They are 
widespread in the world among dogs, but foxes, wolves, coyotes, 
tigers, and wild cats may be the final ``host,'' although humans 
are only accidental ``hosts.'' Humans are infected in the areas 
of habitat of invaded animals through mosquito bites of the 
Aedes, Cubex and Anopheles species. The 
filaria development phase prior to the invasion stage depends on 
the intermediate ``host'' (10-20 days). After entering the 
mosquito's stomach together with the blood, the 
Drepens microfilaria migrate into the insect body 
cavity for 1.5 days. After reaching the invasion stage, the 
larva migrate into the head and mouth organs of the mosquitos 
and from there--into the human organism through bites. 
  An increase in the gnat population was noted in <LOCATION>Pavlodar</LOCATION> and 
<LOCATION>Uralsk</LOCATION> between <DATE>1982</DATE> and <DATE>1991</DATE>: the mean seasonal indicator rose 
by twofold. Such a widespread proliferation of insects in the 
aforesaid regions is the factor which determine the unfavorable 
situation with the transmissible disease, including 
Dirofilariosis.
