<HEAD>Four GOP Candidates Scrap for Chance to Take on Montana's Baucus</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   <PERSON>Max Baucus</PERSON> remembers well the surprise
defeat that <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> voters dealt fellow Democratic <PERSON>Sen. John
Melcher</PERSON> in <DATE>1988</DATE>, and he's maneuvering early to avoid a similar fate.
   The two-term senator faces little challenge in the Democratic
primary on <DATE>June 5</DATE>, but he's amassing a stash of campaign cash to
combat the winner of the four-way Republican primary.
   Baucus has raised about <MONEY>$2 million</MONEY> for what he expects will be a
<MONEY>$2.5 million</MONEY> campaign, the most expensive in the history of rural
<LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>.
   Two years ago, the <ORGANIZATION>National Republican Senatorial Committee</ORGANIZATION>
pumped <MONEY>$205,000</MONEY> into the state GOP, including <MONEY>$138,000</MONEY> in the last
month of the campaign, to help challenger <PERSON>Conrad Burns</PERSON> overtake
<PERSON>Melcher</PERSON>.
   <PERSON>Baucus</PERSON> said the national <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> has targeted him in hopes of a
repeat.
   ``Republican candidates have said they and the <ORGANIZATION>Republican
National Committee</ORGANIZATION> will do whatever it takes to win this seat,''
<PERSON>Baucus</PERSON> said.
   The likely beneficiary of that Republican support is unclear.
   A statewide poll taken in <DATE>April</DATE> showed no clear leader in the
<ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> race between Lt. Gov. <PERSON>Allen Kolstad</PERSON> and businessman-scientist
<PERSON>Bruce Vorhauer</PERSON>. State <PERSON>Sen. Bill Farrell</PERSON> and former business
executive <PERSON>John Domenech</PERSON> lagged behind.
   In the Democratic primary, <PERSON>Baucus</PERSON> is heavily favored over <PERSON>John
Driscoll</PERSON>, a member of the state <ORGANIZATION>Public Service Commission</ORGANIZATION>, and
Billings evangelist Curly <PERSON>Thornton</PERSON>.
   <PERSON>Driscoll</PERSON> has attacked <PERSON>Baucus</PERSON> for obtaining <PERCENT>86 percent</PERCENT> of his
campaign financing from out-of-state interests. But most of the
debate has been among the <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> candidates.
   <PERSON>Kolstad</PERSON> has made an issue of his lifelong ties to <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>,
contrasting his background to that of Vorhauer, who became a state
resident only <DATE>last fall</DATE>, and <PERSON>Domenech</PERSON>, who moved to Bozeman four
years ago.
   <PERSON>Farrell</PERSON> has accused <PERSON>Kolstad</PERSON> of not addressing the issues.
Vorhauer and <PERSON>Farrell</PERSON> have taken a pro-choice position on abortion,
while <PERSON>Kolstad</PERSON> and <PERSON>Domenech</PERSON> are anti-abortion.
   For the most part, the Republicans have similar views on other
issues and emphasize differences in style and personality.
   Kolstad, 58, was a state legislator for 20 years and operates a
family farm and ranch in north-central <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>. He joined <PERSON>Stan
Stephens</PERSON> in the <DATE>1988</DATE> gubernatorial race to become the No. 2 person
in <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>'s first GOP administration in 20 years.
   <PERSON>Kolstad</PERSON> was the last to enter the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> race, but yielded to
entreaties from President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>, Vice President <PERSON>Dan Quayle</PERSON>, former
President <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> and other national GOP leaders seeking a
well-known challenger.
   <PERSON>Farrell</PERSON>, 41, who owns a trucking company, stresses the
blue-collar roots that he believes set him apart from the other
candidates.
   <PERSON>Domenech</PERSON>, 36, quit his job as president of a pharmaceutical
testing firm to run for the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>. He touts his business
experience and said he decided to run because he was angry about a
lack of economic opportunities in <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>.
   Vorhauer, 48, best known as the inventor of the <DATE>Today</DATE>
contraceptive sponge, has divided his time between <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> since <DATE>1979</DATE>. He helped found or develop four
businesses in western <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Baucus</PERSON>, 48, was born and raised in <LOCATION>Helena</LOCATION>, the son of a
prominent <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> ranching family. He entered politics in <DATE>1972</DATE> when
he was elected to the state <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION>. Two years later he went on to
<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> and served two <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> terms before being elected to the
<ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1978</DATE>. He was re-elected in <DATE>1984</DATE> with <PERCENT>57 percent</PERCENT> of the
vote.
   Driscoll is making his second challenge to <PERSON>Baucus</PERSON>; he finished
last in a three-way Democratic primary in <DATE>1978</DATE>. <PERSON>Thornton</PERSON>, who has
made preaching against alcohol and drug abuse the centerpiece of
his campaign, was new to politics in <DATE>1988</DATE> when he finished last in
a six-man Democratic gubernatorial primary.

<HEAD>GOP Looks for Repeat of 1988 Senate Upset in Montana</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Republican <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> candidate <PERSON>Allen Kolstad</PERSON>
has the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> on his side, but <PERSON>Sen. Max Baucus</PERSON> has the money,
the lead and widespread appeal among rural <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> voters.
   Kolstad, the state's lieutenant governor, is a wealthy rancher
and grain farmer who is trying to tar <PERSON>Baucus</PERSON> as a liberal in favor
of big government. Kolstad's conservative pitch even includes a
reminder that he ``opposes <PERSON>Ted Kennedy</PERSON> on most national issues.''
   But <PERSON>Baucus</PERSON> pays close attention to rural and economic concerns.
Pet issues include aid to rural hospitals, <ORGANIZATION>Essential Air Service</ORGANIZATION>
subsidies for rural airline routes and agricultural trade. He voted
against the <DATE>1990</DATE> farm bill, saying it didn't do enough for farmers.
   Kolstad was at least 20 points behind <PERSON>Baucus</PERSON> in an independent
mid-September poll. In addition, the Republican is up against the
largest campaign bankroll in <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> history.
   Baucus raised <MONEY>$1.9 million</MONEY> in the 18 months ending in <DATE>June</DATE>, a
princely sum in a state with only 800,000 people. Aggressive
fund-raising efforts continue.
   Baucus says he's just taking precautions.
   Kolstad had only <MONEY>$267,000</MONEY> in campaign funds on <DATE>June 30</DATE>, but if
the race gets closer, he may look to national GOP groups for
eleventh-hour fund-raising help.
   That approach worked in <DATE>1988</DATE>, when political newcomer <PERSON>Conrad
Burns</PERSON> narrowly upset two-term Democratic <PERSON>Sen. John Melcher</PERSON> of
<LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> to become the first Republican <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> senator from this state
in 36 years. The huge infusions of cash used to help <PERSON>Burns</PERSON> are
being challenged in a lawsuit and in a complaint before the <ORGANIZATION>Federal
Election Commission</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``If someone unfairly attacks me, I'm going to respond,'' says
<PERSON>Baucus</PERSON>. ``I just have be to prepared for the possibility that I'll
face the same deluge of dollars.''
   In the <DATE>1988</DATE> race, <PERSON>Burns</PERSON>, a former farm-and-ranch broadcaster,
attacked <PERSON>Melcher</PERSON> as a liberal out of touch with conservative, rural
<LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>.
   Kolstad has adopted the same strategy.
   ``More federal bureaucracy, more federal control, the higher
deficits - there are the things I'm going to be fighting against in
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>,'' says <PERSON>Kolstad</PERSON>.
   Like <PERSON>Burns</PERSON>, <PERSON>Kolstad</PERSON> was recruited by national <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> heavyweights,
including President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> and former President <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>. <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> raised
more than <MONEY>$100,000</MONEY> for <PERSON>Kolstad</PERSON> when the president traveled to
<LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> in <DATE>July</DATE>.
   Kolstad cannot claim the mantle of political outsider. He spent
20 years in the <LOCATION>Montana Legislature</LOCATION> before winning the lieutenant
governorship on the <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> ticket with Gov. <PERSON>Stan Stephens</PERSON> in <DATE>1988</DATE>.
   The Stephens-Kolstad adminstration has not been universally
popular in <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>, struggling with tax and budget issues and
controversial appointees. Recent polls show his ``negatives''
nearly doubled since a similar poll in mid-June.
   Kolstad, 58, says he is saving his money for a last-minute
barrage of media advertising attacking <PERSON>Baucus</PERSON> on his votes against
defense spending, tax cuts and budget-balancing measures.
   The 48-year-old <PERSON>Baucus</PERSON>, running for a third term, has been
working hard to dispel whatever liberal image he may have had.
   He earns relatively high marks from most liberal interest groups
but insists he doesn't care about ratings.
   ``I don't look left, I don't look right, I look forward - to
what is the best solution for <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>,'' says <PERSON>Baucus</PERSON>. ``Most people
are more concerned with producing results for <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> than with
labels.''
   <PERSON>Baucus</PERSON> has barely mentioned <PERSON>Kolstad</PERSON> in campaign materials,
preferring instead to emphasize efforts he says have created or
protected jobs in economically depressed <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>.
   While differences between the candidates exist - <PERSON>Baucus</PERSON> is
pro-choice on abortion, <PERSON>Kolstad</PERSON> is not, for example - the race has
generated few fireworks.

   Montanan <PERSON>John Melcher</PERSON> is using pastoral
politics in his fight to retain his <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Senate</ORGANIZATION> seat and prevent
<PERSON>Conrad Burns</PERSON> from becoming the state's first Republican senator
since <DATE>1952</DATE>.
   ``Every election some greenhorn runs against <PERSON>Doc Melcher</PERSON>,'' says
a talking cow in one <PERSON>Melcher</PERSON> campaign ad. ``They come in thinking
they can put Doc out to pasture.''
   ``But they leave with egg on their faces, and even worse on their
shoes,'' chuckles another cud-chewing bovine.
   <PERSON>Melcher</PERSON>, a veterinarian and two-term senator, holds a
double-digit lead over <LOCATION>Burns</LOCATION> in recent state polls, but the
Republican county commissioner from Billings is waging a spirited
challenge.
   ``I just think <PERSON>John Melcher</PERSON> is completely out of step with the
majority of Montanans,'' says <PERSON>Burns</PERSON>, who has been hammering away at
his opponent as ``too liberal'' and an ineffective member of the
<ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>.
   The liberal accusation is nothing new for <PERSON>Melcher</PERSON>, who was
targeted for defeat by the <ORGANIZATION>National Conservative Political Action
Committee</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1982</DATE>.
   He responded with TV ads that featured talking cows ridiculing
NCPAC as a herd of city-slickers trying to fool Montanans about
``old <PERSON>Doc Melcher</PERSON>.''
   Earlier this year, <PERSON>Burns</PERSON> picked up on the theme, warning voters
that <PERSON>Doc Melcher</PERSON>'s cows would be ``spreading real bull'' this
election. In response, the incumbent senator again trotted out his
campaign cows.
   <PERSON>Melcher</PERSON>, 64, a senior member of the <ORGANIZATION>Senate Agriculture Committee</ORGANIZATION>,
portrays himself as a fighter who stands up for family farmers,
workers and <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>'s basic industries _ timber, mining and
agriculture.
   In <DATE>1985</DATE>, he fought <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> administration attempts to reduce price
supports for grain, cotton and rice.
   ``If what I get done is beneficial, then that's how I should be
judged,'' he says. ``There are very few people in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> who
understand what the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION> is all about.''
   Melcher is also considered something of a maverick. He was one of
only two senators who voted against the Omnibus Drug Bill of <DATE>1986</DATE>,
one of only three who opposed the <DATE>1986</DATE> tax overhaul bill, and one of
only three who voted against the U.S.-Canadian trade agreement this
year.
   Melcher received high ratings from many liberal groups, but he
has voted with conservatives on several key issues.
   He opposed the <ORGANIZATION>Panama Canal</ORGANIZATION> treaty in <DATE>1978</DATE>, supported <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>'s
<DATE>1981</DATE> tax cuts and the balanced-budget law and is a staunch opponent
of abortion.
   Burns, 53, operated a farm-and-ranch broadcasting service until
he ran for commissioner in <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>'s largest county in <DATE>1986</DATE>. He
upset the Democratic incumbent, and announced earlier this year he
would take on <PERSON>Melcher</PERSON>.
   ``There's quite a bit of dissatisfaction here in the state of
<LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>,'' he says. ``I don't think we can stand six more years of
the same.''
   folksy, personable campaigner, <PERSON>Burns</PERSON> has been barnstorming the
state, meeting voters door-to-door. He says his outgoing, friendly
style will be more effective in the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> than <PERSON>Melcher</PERSON>'s
``obstructionist'' tactics.
   But <PERSON>Burns</PERSON>' media campaign carries a strident tone, labeling
<PERSON>Melcher</PERSON> as soft on drugs, crime, and defense, and describing him as
a big-spending liberal who likes to raise taxes.
   Some of <PERSON>Burns</PERSON>' advertising was prepared with help from the
<ORGANIZATION>Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee</ORGANIZATION>, which helped recruit him
as a candidate and considers him one of the <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION>'s best shots at
knocking off an incumbent <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> Democrat in <DATE>1988</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Burns</PERSON>' <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> managers have denied suggestions that the national
committee is calling the shots for the campaign, but say the
assistance is welcome and needed to offset <PERSON>Melcher</PERSON>'s 2-to-1
advantage in campaign funds.
   Despite polls showing him behind, <PERSON>Burns</PERSON> is convinced he has a
chance. He says his agricultural background will help him cut into
<PERSON>Melcher</PERSON>'s power base in eastern <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>, which <PERSON>Melcher</PERSON> represented
in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> for 7{ years.
   ``I think it's going to be tighter than a new pair of shoes,''
<PERSON>Burns</PERSON> says of the election.

<TEXT>
   Montana Republicans tapped Lt. Gov. <PERSON>Allen
Kolstad</PERSON> to challenge Democratic <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> <PERSON>Sen. Max Baucus</PERSON>, who brushed
aside his primary opposition but said he's taking nothing for
granted in <DATE>November</DATE>.
   Baucus, raised more than <MONEY>$2 million</MONEY> in campaign money even before
<DATE>Tuesday</DATE>'s primary victory, but recalled the <DATE>1988</DATE> upset of Democratic
<PERSON>Sen. John Melcher</PERSON> by upstart Republican <PERSON>Conrad Burns</PERSON>.
   ``One never takes anything for granted _ ever,'' said <PERSON>Baucus</PERSON>, 48.
   Kolstad, a 58-year-old farmer-rancher and 20-year veteran of
<LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> politics, bested three rivals in a hotly contested <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION>
primary.
   With <PERCENT>98 percent</PERCENT> of 967 precincts reporting early today, <PERSON>Kolstad</PERSON>
had 36,897 votes, or <PERCENT>43 percent</PERCENT>; to 30,451 votes, or <PERCENT>36 percent</PERCENT>, for
scientist-businessman <PERSON>Bruce Vorhauer</PERSON>; 11,484, or <PERCENT>13 percent</PERCENT>, for
state <PERSON>Sen. Bill Farrell</PERSON>; and 6,525, or <PERCENT>8 percent</PERCENT>, for businessman
<PERSON>John Domenech</PERSON>.
   Kolstad promised a campaign that would ``keep Senator Baucus up
against the ropes right from the beginning.''
   ``We're just going to have to outwork him,'' he said. ``We're
used to putting in a lot of 16- and 18-hour days on the ranch. We're
going to convert that energy into the campaign.''
   Baucus had 79,131 votes, or <PERCENT>83 percent</PERCENT>, to 12,444 votes, or <PERCENT>13
percent</PERCENT> for state <ORGANIZATION>Public Service</ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON>John Driscoll</PERSON>; and
4,321 votes, or <PERCENT>5 percent</PERCENT>, for evangelist Curly <PERSON>Thornton</PERSON>.
   Kolstad was recruited by national Republicans, including
President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> and former President <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>. Baucus, pointing to the
national <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> involvement, predicted that <PERSON>Kolstad</PERSON>'s campaign would be
run from <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>.
   Kolstad, emphasized his farming background and his lifelong ties
to <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>. The emphasis also was a slap at Vorhauer, who moved his
legal residence to <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> only <DATE>last fall</DATE>.
   Vorhauer, 48, is best known as the inventor of the Today
contraceptive sponge. His campaign stressed his engineering and
science background as qualifying him to bring high-tech businesses
to the state.
   <PERSON>Farrell</PERSON>, 41, who operates a small independent trucking firm,
touted his working-man image. <PERSON>Domenech</PERSON>, 36, campaigned for a
national health plan.
   Baucus ran a quiet primary campaign, with neither of his
challengrs having much in the way of money or organizations.

   <PERSON>Sen. Max Baucus</PERSON> and his Democratic
supporters say they're bracing for an avalanche of Republican cash
in this <DATE>fall</DATE>'s general election battle with Lt. Gov. <PERSON>Allen Kolstad</PERSON>.
   But <PERSON>Baucus</PERSON>, a two-term Democrat who was nominated for re-election
<DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, has his own pile of campaign cash, which Republicans are
trying to turn into a liability rather than an asset.
   ``Senator <PERSON>Baucus</PERSON> will learn the hard way that <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> cannot be
bought with an out-of-state war chest,'' said <ORGANIZATION>Montana GOP</ORGANIZATION> Chairman
<PERSON>Barbara Campbell</PERSON>. ``Does he need <MONEY>$2 million</MONEY> to get re-elected to a
job he's held for 12 years? That says he's very weak.''
   Baucus coasted past two primary opponents <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> with <PERCENT>83 percent</PERCENT>
of the Democratic vote, while <PERSON>Kolstad</PERSON> won a four-man race with <PERCENT>43
percent</PERCENT> of the <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> vote.
   Kolstad and the Republicans are hoping for a repeat of <DATE>1988</DATE>, when
upstart Republican <PERSON>Conrad Burns</PERSON> pulled off an upset victory over
two-term incumbent Democratic <PERSON>Sen. John Melcher</PERSON>.
   Kolstad promised <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> to run an above-board campaign
focusing on economic issues and refraining from personal attacks.
But Democratic Party Chairman <PERSON>Bruce Nelson</PERSON> said he expects <PERSON>Kolstad</PERSON>
to go on the offensive against <PERSON>Baucus</PERSON>.
   ``The pattern that Republicans set two years ago of a relentless
negative attack is the same thing that they will do this year,'' he
predicted.
   Baucus already has raised more than <MONEY>$2 million</MONEY> in campaign funds,
smashing the state campaign-spending record of <MONEY>$1.2 million</MONEY> set by
<PERSON>Melcher</PERSON> in <DATE>1988</DATE>.

   Republican <PERSON>Conrad Burns</PERSON> only has two years
of political experience but the folksy former broadcaster is not
intimidated by the transition from county commissioner to the
powerful <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Senate</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``There's really no difference. We're just dealing in more zeros.
The responsibility's the same,'' said <PERSON>Burns</PERSON> after writing himself
into <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> history with an upset victory over two-term Democratic
<PERSON>Sen. John Melcher</PERSON>.
   On a day that saw Republicans capture the presidency, the
governorship and the state <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Burns</PERSON> became the first Republican
senator from <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> in 36 years and only the second man ever to
defeat an incumbent <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> senator in <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>.
   ``It's nice to have a personal friend in the statehouse and it's
nice to have a personal friend in the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON>Burns</PERSON> said
<DATE>Tuesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>.
   The 53-year-old <PERSON>Burns</PERSON> is a <LOCATION>Yellowstone County</LOCATION> commissioner from
Billings, <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>'s largest city. He entered politics only two years
ago after a career as a broadcaster, livestock show manager and
field representative for a ranching publication.
   Burns barnstormed the state, meeting voters door-to-door and
telling them his outgoing, friendly style will be more effective in
the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> than <PERSON>Melcher</PERSON>'s ``obstructionist'' tactics.
   Burns campaigned as a conservative, saying <PERSON>Melcher</PERSON> was ``too
liberal'' for <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> and not an effective senator. He also labeled
<PERSON>Melcher</PERSON> a supporter of higher taxes and promised to vote against any
tax increasing, saying the federal deficit can be balanced by
restraining spending.
   ``I always like to win, but I enter all these things realizing
that voters may not approve,'' <PERSON>Melcher</PERSON> said <DATE>early Wednesday</DATE>. ``And
if they don't, you have to accept that.''
   The <ORGANIZATION>Republican National Senatorial Committee</ORGANIZATION> helped recruit <PERSON>Burns</PERSON>
as a candidate and assisted his campaign with money and advice.

   Primaries in seven states cleared the way for
multimillion-dollar <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> battles in <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>,
and Republicans said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> the results also bolstered their
hopes of ousting Sens. <PERSON>Jeff Bingaman</PERSON> of <LOCATION>New Mexico</LOCATION> and <PERSON>John Melcher</PERSON>
of <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>.
   In <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, voters rejected propositions authorizing an AIDS
quarantine, closing the Rancho Seco nuclear plant, dividing mammoth
<LOCATION>San Bernardino County</LOCATION> in two and relaxing state spending limits
imposed after tax-slashing Proposition 13 was passed a decade ago.
   <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>'s ballots also included one race for governor and one
for mayor. In <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>, former Democratic Gov. <PERSON>Thomas Judge</PERSON> captured
the nomination to succeed retiring Democrat <PERSON>Ted Schwinden</PERSON>, scoring
<PERCENT>39 percent</PERCENT> of the vote in a six-man race. He will face Republican
former state <PERSON>Sen. Stan Stephens</PERSON>. In <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>, Mayor <PERSON>Maureen

   In congressional races, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON>Ernest Konnyu</PERSON>, a

the first incumbent to lose a primary this year, falling by a <PERCENT>58

moderate <ORGANIZATION>Stanford</ORGANIZATION> professor.
   <LOCATION>Newark</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Councilman Donald Payne</PERSON> won the Democratic
nomination in the 10th District with <PERCENT>73 percent</PERCENT> of the vote for a
chance to succeed retiring <PERSON>Peter Rodino</PERSON> and become the state's
first black in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>. Victory in the primary is tantamount to
election in the overwhelmingly Democratic district.
   <PERSON>Oliver North</PERSON>, the fired <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> national security aide
indicted in the Iran-Contra affair, scored a personal success as a
campaigner when two Republicans for whom he stumped in <LOCATION>Southern
California</LOCATION> won congressional primaries. Former deputy <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION>
counsel <PERSON>Christopher Cox</PERSON> was the victor over 12 rivals in the 40th
District and former <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> administration speechwriter <PERSON>Dana

   In <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> races, first-term New Jersey Democrat <PERSON>Frank Lautenberg</PERSON>
polled <PERCENT>77 percent</PERCENT> of the vote against two challengers and will
defend his seat against <PERSON>Pete Dawkins</PERSON>, a former star athlete, <PERSON>Rhodes</PERSON>
scholar and <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> War hero who moved from <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION>

   The two expect to spend a total of <MONEY>$14 million</MONEY> on the race,
which the national <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> has targeted as vital to its hopes of
recapturing the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>. Democrats now control it 54-46.

   ``<PERSON>Wilson</PERSON> has spent <MONEY>$7 million</MONEY> already on his re-election, and
his numbers are exactly where they were 18 months ago, at <PERCENT>50
percent</PERCENT>, which is the definition of a very vulnerable incumbent,''
said <PERSON>Anita Dunn</PERSON>, communications director for the <ORGANIZATION>Democratic
Senatorial Campaign Committee</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>.
   Her counterpart in the <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Tom Mason</PERSON>, saw vulnerability on the
Democratic side in <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>, where <PERSON>Sen. John Melcher</PERSON> won nomination
to a third term with <PERCENT>76 percent</PERCENT> of the vote against a political
newcomer.
   ``The good news for us is that <PERSON>Melcher</PERSON>'s <PERCENT>76 percent</PERCENT> against a
nobody tells us a good manifestation of voter dissatisfaction,''
<PERSON>Mason</PERSON> said.
   <PERSON>Melcher</PERSON>, not surprisingly, took exception to that analysis.
   ``I think the <ORGANIZATION>Republican Senatorial Committee</ORGANIZATION> would like to
capture this seat,'' he said. ``I'm going to make sure that doesn't
happen.''
   The Republican candidate, county commissioner <PERSON>Conrad Burns</PERSON>, said
he expected <PERSON>Melcher</PERSON> to attack him as inexperienced, but added,
``When you're green, you're growing, and when you're ripe, you're
rotten.... That's how we'll counter.''
   Mason also said the victory by state <PERSON>Sen. Bill Valentine</PERSON> in <LOCATION>New
Mexico</LOCATION>'s four-man <ORGANIZATION>GOP Senate</ORGANIZATION> primary put him in good shape for a
run at first-term Democrat <PERSON>Bingaman</PERSON>.
   ``It was a clean campaign, and there are no scars left, so we
can focus on <PERSON>Bingaman</PERSON>'s lack of name ID and lack of depth of
support,'' <PERSON>Mason</PERSON> said.
   Valentine immediately attacked his rival as too liberal for <LOCATION>New
Mexico</LOCATION>, saying <PERSON>Bingaman</PERSON> supported ``big labor, big government and
big spending on the part of <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>.''
   With <PERCENT>97 percent</PERCENT> of the vote counted, <ORGANIZATION>Valentine</ORGANIZATION> had 33,698 votes
or <PERCENT>43 percent</PERCENT>, and his closest challenger, former <ORGANIZATION>Interior
Department</ORGANIZATION> official <PERSON>Rick Montoya</PERSON>, had 22,392 votes or <PERCENT>28 percent</PERCENT>.
   In other voting <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, Circuit <PERSON>Judge Mark Kennedy</PERSON>, a
son-in-law of former Gov. <PERSON>George C. Wallace</PERSON>, won the Democratic
nomination to the <ORGANIZATION>Alabama Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION>; five supporters of <PERSON>Lyndon
LaRouche</PERSON> all lost congressional primaries in <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>; and in <LOCATION>South
Dakota</LOCATION>, there were no statewide races and only 26 primaries for the
105 state <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> seats.

<HEAD>New Allegations in Lawsuit Against Montana GOP, National
Republican Committee</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB ANEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HELENA, Mont. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The former executive director of the
<ORGANIZATION>Montana Republican Party</ORGANIZATION> has accused the organization, its
chairwoman and a national <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> committee of breaking federal
racketeering laws.
   The allegations involved the handling of political money during
the <DATE>1988</DATE> campaigns.
   <PERSON>Terry Merica</PERSON> made the allegations in a complaint filed in <ORGANIZATION>U.S.
District Court</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>. It amends a lawsuit he and his wife,
<PERSON>Neida</PERSON>, filed in <DATE>December</DATE>.
   The complaint alleges that the state GOP, Chairwoman <PERSON>Barbara
Campbell</PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION>National Republican Senatorial Committee</ORGANIZATION> committed
wire and mail fraud by illegally funneling money into the campaigns
of <PERSON>Sen. Conrad Burns</PERSON> and Gov. <PERSON>Stan Stephens</PERSON>.
   Burns, at the time a county commissioner in Billings, upset
Democratic incumbent <PERSON>Sen. John Melcher</PERSON> in the <DATE>November</DATE> election.
<PERSON>Stephens</PERSON> defeated former Democratic Gov. <PERSON>Tom Judge</PERSON> in the race for
governor.
   The complaint says the defendants used a series of letters and
money transfers in the <DATE>spring</DATE> and <DATE>summer of 1988</DATE> to defraud the
citizens of <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>.
   The original lawsuit alleged the Mericas were fired in late <DATE>1988</DATE>
for questioning whether financial dealings between the state
<ORGANIZATION>Republican Party</ORGANIZATION> and the national committee violated state and
federal election laws.
   Neida Merica was an administrative secretary for the state <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION>.
   <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>'s complaint contends there were additional violations
of the federal Racketeer Influenced, Corrupt Organizations Act.
   <PERSON>Charles Erdmann</PERSON>, attorney for the <ORGANIZATION>Montana GOP</ORGANIZATION>, said the new
contentions may reflect <LOCATION>Merica</LOCATION>'s concern that the original suit
will be dismissed.
   ``This may be nothing more than an attempt to bolster their
complaint,'' he said.
   He would not comment on specifics, saying he had not seen the
new complaint, but he questioned the timing of its filing. The
state <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> convention began <DATE>Thursday</DATE> in Billings, with President
<PERSON>Bush</PERSON> scheduled to appear in the <TIME>evening</TIME> on behalf of Lt. Gov. <PERSON>Allen
Kolstad</PERSON>, who is challenging Democratic incumbent <PERSON>Sen. Max Baucus</PERSON>.
   ``The timing of this would make you think this is politically
motivated,'' <PERSON>Campbell</PERSON> said <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   <PERSON>James Goetz</PERSON>, the Mericas' attorney, said the timing was
coincidence.
   The <ORGANIZATION>National Republican Senatorial Committee</ORGANIZATION>, which helps
organize campaigns of <ORGANIZATION>GOP Senate</ORGANIZATION> candidates, had no immediate
comment on the new allegations.
   The complaint alleges the defendants committed mail and wire
fraud by not legally reporting as much as <MONEY>$200,000</MONEY> in campaign
contributions in <DATE>1988</DATE>.
   It cites several instances of questionable handling of campaign
financing. It alleges that:
   _The national committee conducted a voter identification project
in <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>, but gave results only to the <PERSON>Burns</PERSON> and <PERSON>Stephens</PERSON>
campaigns. The cost of the project was never reported as a
contribution to the campaigns and the expense exceeded the federal
limit on what such committees can give to a candidate.
   _The national committee transferred thousands of dollars through
the <ORGANIZATION>Montana GOP</ORGANIZATION>'s accounts to help pay for a direct mailing by a
<LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> company for the <PERSON>Burns</PERSON> campaign in violation of federal
election laws.
   _Between <DATE>Aug. 8, 1988</DATE>, and <DATE>Nov. 16, 1988</DATE>, the national committee
shifted <MONEY>$178,145</MONEY> into the <ORGANIZATION>Montana GOP</ORGANIZATION>'s account. The money
transfers prompted a <DATE>Nov. 8</DATE> memo from <PERSON>Ward Shanahan</PERSON>, the state
party's lawyer, to <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> headquarters warning that the national
committee was using the <ORGANIZATION>Montana Republican Party</ORGANIZATION> for ``financial
shenanigans.''
   _In <DATE>October 1988</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>Republican Governors' Association</ORGANIZATION> gave
<MONEY>$8,000</MONEY> to the <ORGANIZATION>Montana GOP</ORGANIZATION> with a letter from Executive Director
<PERSON>Michele Davis</PERSON> saying the money should be reported as coming from
the <ORGANIZATION>Republican National Committee</ORGANIZATION>.

   County Commissioner <PERSON>Conrad Burns</PERSON> may not

him in <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>'s history books.
   <PERSON>Burns</PERSON>' win <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> made him only the second man to defeat an
incumbent <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> senator in <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>. It also made him the first
Republican senator from <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> in 36 years.
   Burns, a farm-and-ranch broadcaster and a county commissioner in
Billings who was making his second try for elective office, defeated
Melcher <PERCENT>52 percent</PERCENT> to <PERCENT>48 percent</PERCENT>.
   Republican <PERSON>Stan Stephens</PERSON> won the <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> gubernatorial race,
defeating former Democratic Gov. <PERSON>Thomas Judge</PERSON> by 189,630 votes to
168,537 votes, a margin of <PERCENT>53 percent</PERCENT> to <PERCENT>47 percent</PERCENT>. <PERSON>Stephens</PERSON> will

   <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON> captured <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>'s four electoral votes, defeating
<ORGANIZATION>Michael Dukakis</ORGANIZATION> <PERCENT>53 percent</PERCENT> to <PERCENT>47 percent</PERCENT>. <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> had 189,598 votes to

   Melcher had been targeted for defeat by the <ORGANIZATION>Republican National
Senatorial Committee</ORGANIZATION>, which helped recruit <PERSON>Burns</PERSON> and funneled almost
<MONEY>$400,000</MONEY> into his campaign.
   ``I was hoping to campaign for a month solid,'' <PERSON>Melcher</PERSON> said.
``I've only been out here just about 17 or 18 days. I never really
had a good feel for the race.''
   <PERSON>Stephens</PERSON>, a former radio broadcaster and cable television company
owner from <LOCATION>Havre</LOCATION>, said his victory reflected <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>'s desire ``to
put someone with business experience in the executive position of
the state.''
   Both <ORGANIZATION>Montana U.S. House</ORGANIZATION> seats went to the incumbents, Democrat
<PERSON>Pat Williams</PERSON> and Republican <PERSON>Ron Marlenee</PERSON>.
   Montana voters refused to repeal the state's mandatory seat-belt
law; approved repeal of the constitutional right of the needy to
welfare benefits; and defeated a mandatory deposit on beverage
containers.

   A bitter primary campaign for governor of <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> is winding
down in a flurry of television commercials while <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION>
Democrats are choosing a challenger to Republican <PERSON>Sen. Jesse Helms</PERSON>.
All told, candidates in nine states are vying for support <DATE>Tuesday,
1990</DATE>'s busiest primary election day so far.
   Democrats <PERSON>Dianne Feinstein</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>John Van de Kamp</ORGANIZATION> have spent months
attacking each other's positions on abortion, the death penalty and
how to deal with <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>'s <MONEY>$3.6 billion</MONEY> budget deficit.
   Polls suggested their race was a dead heat as they entered the
<DATE>last weekend</DATE> of the primary campaign.
   On the Republican side, <PERSON>Sen. Pete Wilson</PERSON> faced only token primary
opposition and sat on a huge campaign war chest as he waited to
learn which Democrat would be his opponent in the race to succeed
retiring Gov. <PERSON>George Deukmejian</PERSON>, a Republican.
   In <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Harvey Gantt</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mike Easley</PERSON> were in a runoff
for the <ORGANIZATION>Democratic Senate</ORGANIZATION> nomination. <PERSON>Gantt</PERSON>, the former mayor of
<LOCATION>Charlotte</LOCATION>, finished first in a six-way primary <DATE>May 8</DATE>, but failed to
get the <PERCENT>40 percent</PERCENT> necessary to avoid a runoff with the second-place
finisher.
   Meanwhile, <PERSON>Helms</PERSON> has started running television ads accusing the
Democrats of throwing mud at him.
   Voters also will go to the polls <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> in <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New Mexico</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>South Dakota</LOCATION>.
   In <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION>, five Democrats were battling for the right to
challenge Gov. Guy Hunt, the first Republican elected governor of
the state since Reconstruction. The contenders were state Attorney
General <PERSON>Don Siegelman</PERSON>, former Gov. <LOCATION>Fob James</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON>Ronnie
Flippo</PERSON>, state <PERSON>Sen. Charles Bishop</PERSON>, and <PERSON>Paul Hubbert</PERSON>, executive
director of the <ORGANIZATION>Alabama Education Association</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>Sen. Howell Heflin</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-Ala.</LOCATION>, and Republican state <PERSON>Sen. Bill
Cabannis</PERSON> were assured of their party nominations, setting up a
face-off in <DATE>November</DATE>.
   Abortion was the big issue in <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>, where three Democrats were
vying to take on GOP Gov. <PERSON>Terry Branstad</PERSON>, an opponent of legalized
abortion. The <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION> chapter of the <ORGANIZATION>National Abortion Rights Action
League</ORGANIZATION> endorsed <PERSON>Don Avenson</PERSON>, speaker of the <ORGANIZATION>Iowa House</ORGANIZATION>, a move that
provoked an angry response from banker <PERSON>John Chrystal</PERSON>, who, like
<PERSON>Avenson</PERSON>, supports legal abortion.
   NARAL's decision to weigh in on the race was believed aimed at
the third Democrat, Attorney General <PERSON>Tom Miller</PERSON>, an opponent of
abortion. <PERSON>Miller</PERSON> was an early favorite in the race and NARAL leaders
were concerned the fall election would be between two opponents of
abortion.
   In the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> primary in <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>, incumbent Democrat <PERSON>Tom Harkin</PERSON> and
his <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> challenger, Rep. <PERSON>Tom Tauke</PERSON>, were assured of their party
nominations.
   Another crowded field was battling in Democratic and Republican
gubernatorial primaries in <LOCATION>New Mexico</LOCATION>, where incumbent <PERSON>Garrey
Carruthers</PERSON>, a Republican, was ineligible to seek a second term.
   For the first time in the state's history, the governor elected
in <DATE>1990</DATE> will be allowed to serve two consecutive four-year terms.
   The leading contenders on the Democratic side were <LOCATION>Albuquerque</LOCATION>
lawyer <PERSON>Paul Bardacke</PERSON> and rancher <PERSON>Bruce King</PERSON>, who already has served
eight years as governor, elected first in <DATE>1970</DATE> and again in <DATE>1978</DATE>.
   Regarded as the top <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> contenders were <ORGANIZATION>Frank Bond</ORGANIZATION>, a former
legislator and education commissioner, and <LOCATION>Les Houston</LOCATION>, the
Republican leader of the state <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>.
   Four Republicans were competing in <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> to challenge
Democratic <PERSON>Sen. Max Baucus</PERSON>. Two years ago, underdog <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> challenger
<PERSON>Conrad Burns</PERSON> toppled Democratic <PERSON>Sen. John Melcher</PERSON>, and the
Republicans are hoping to repeat that success this year. Vying to
take on <PERSON>Baucus</PERSON> were Lt. Gov. <PERSON>Allen Kolstad</PERSON>, state <PERSON>Sen. Bill Farrell</PERSON>,
and businessmen <PERSON>John Domenech</PERSON> and <PERSON>Bruce Vorhauer</PERSON>.
   Abortion was an issue in a three-way congressional primary in <LOCATION>New
Jersey</LOCATION>. state Assemblyman <PERSON>Rodney Frelinghuysen</PERSON> and state <PERSON>Sen.
Richard A. Zimmer</PERSON>, supporters of the pro-choice position, were
competing with professional football player <PERSON>Phil McConkey</PERSON>, an
abortion opponent, for the <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> nomination. The winner will face
Democrat <PERSON>Marguerite Chandler</PERSON> in <DATE>November</DATE> for the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> seat held by
<PERSON>James Courter</PERSON>, the defeated <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> candidate for governor in <DATE>1989</DATE>.
   The leading candidates in the Democratic primary to fill the
<ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> seat formerly held by Democrat <PERSON>James Florio</PERSON>, the winner of
last year's campaign for governor of <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION>, were <PERSON>Linda Bowker</PERSON>,
president of the state chapter of the <ORGANIZATION>National Organization for
Women</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Camden County</LOCATION> official <PERSON>Robert E. Andrews</PERSON>. <LOCATION>Gloucester
County</LOCATION> official <PERSON>Daniel Mangini</PERSON> had no opposition in the Republican
primary.
   The <DATE>November</DATE> lineups were virtually assured for <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> races in
<LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New Mexico</LOCATION>, where Democrat <PERSON>Bill Bradley</PERSON> and
Republican <PERSON>Pete Domenici</PERSON> were heavily favored for re-election. In
<LOCATION>South Dakota</LOCATION>, Republican <PERSON>Larry Pressler</PERSON> will be challenged in
<DATE>November</DATE> by <ORGANIZATION>Democrat Ted Muenster</ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION>, no Democrat filed
to oppose Republican <PERSON>Sen. Thad Cochran</PERSON>.
   Abortion was just one of the issues raised in the heated
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION> gubernatorial primary.
   The <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> governor's office was the biggest prize in the
<DATE>1990</DATE> elections. The Democrats control the legislature and if they
can recapture the governor's office, the party will have the
political advantage next year when lines are redrawn for the state's
congressional districts. With 45 seats, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> already has the
largest <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> delegation and the state is expected to gain six more
as a result of the <DATE>1990</DATE> Census.
   The Republicans recruited <PERSON>Wilson</PERSON>, re-elected to the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> in
<DATE>1988</DATE>, to run for governor. Van de Kamp, the state attorney general,
was the early favorite for the Democratic nomination. But <PERSON>Feinstein</PERSON>,
the former mayor of <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, surprised many observers with the
strength of her campaign.
   A supporter of the death penalty, <PERSON>Feinstein</PERSON> contrasted her
position with <ORGANIZATION>Van de Kamp</ORGANIZATION>'s opposition to capital punishment. She
also suggested that as a woman, her pro-choice credentials were
stronger than <ORGANIZATION>Van de Kamp's</ORGANIZATION>.
   Van de <PERSON>Kamp</PERSON> said he personally opposes capital punishment but
would uphold <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>'s death penalty, and countered with a
commercial saying he had put or kept 277 murderers on death row. His
most recent ad features an endorsement from consumer advocate <PERSON>Ralph
Nader</PERSON>, who labels <PERSON>Feinstein</PERSON> ``a Republican in Democratic clothing.''
   While the Democratic contenders were spending millions on
commercials in the primary, <PERSON>Wilson</PERSON> has raised close to <MONEY>$10 million</MONEY>
while facing only token primary opposition.
   Also on the ballot in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> were two Republican-backed
propositions designed to dilute the legislature's power of
redistricting. One would require any plan to pass by a two-thirds
vote of both chambers, the other would remove it entirely and place
it in the hands of a non-partisan commission. Democrats oppose both
proposals.
   In <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Gantt</PERSON>, bidding to become the first black
Democrat ever elected to the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON>Easley</PERSON> have spent more time
attacking <PERSON>Helms</PERSON> than each other.
   And now the Republican senator has responded with an animated
television ad that shows a wooded scene with flowers blooming and
birds chirping. It then shifts to a bullet-riddled photo of <PERSON>Helms</PERSON>
nailed to a tree and closes with a blob of mud hitting the picture.
A voice then says, ``Isn't it nice that <PERSON>Mike Easley</PERSON> and <PERSON>Harvey Gantt</PERSON>
aren't running negative campaigns?''

   Voters rejected a possible AIDS quarantine in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>,
nominated a councilman to become the first black congressman in <LOCATION>New
Jersey</LOCATION>, and launched a comeback by former Gov. <PERSON>Thomas Judge</PERSON> in
<LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>.
   In other results from seven state primaries <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, voters set
the stage for four <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> races:
   <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> _ Democratic Lt. Gov. <PERSON>Leo McCarthy</PERSON> piled up <PERCENT>81
percent</PERCENT> of the vote against three challengers and will oppose
moderate Republican <PERSON>Sen. Pete Wilson</PERSON>. <PERSON>McCarthy</PERSON> said he would attack
<PERSON>Wilson</PERSON> for a lack of leadership, adding, ``you must speak from your
convictions to people. You don't jump on winning sides.''
   New Jersey _ First-term Democratic <PERSON>Sen. Frank Lautenberg</PERSON>
trounced two opponents with <PERCENT>77 percent</PERCENT> of the vote and will face
<ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> newcomer <PERSON>Peter Dawkins</PERSON>, a former star athlete, <PERSON>Rhodes</PERSON> scholar
and <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> war hero. <PERSON>Dawkins</PERSON> criticized <PERSON>Lautenberg</PERSON>'s opposition to
the death penalty and willingness to support tax increases.
<PERSON>Lautenberg</PERSON> said <PERSON>Dawkins</PERSON>, who recently moved to <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION>, ``has
demonstrated a lack of knowledge'' about environmental and other
issues of concern to the state's voters.
   <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> _ Democratic <PERSON>Sen. John Melcher</PERSON> won <PERCENT>74 percent</PERCENT> of the
vote against a political unknown in his bid for a third term and
will run against Republican <PERSON>Conrad Burns</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Yellowstone County</LOCATION>
commissioner. ``I think it's pretty obvious I've been here
awhile,'' <PERSON>Melcher</PERSON> said from <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>. ``The longer you're here,
the more chances you have to get bills passed ... that will benefit
<LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>.''
   New <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> _ State <PERSON>Sen. Bill Valentine</PERSON> outpolled three
Republicans for the right to take on first-term Democratic <PERSON>Sen.
Jeff Bingaman</PERSON>. Valentine said <PERSON>Bingaman</PERSON> supported ``big labor, big
government and big spending on the part of <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>'' and had
fallen in line ``with the <LOCATION>East Coast</LOCATION> liberals.''
   With <PERCENT>97 percent</PERCENT> of the vote counted, <ORGANIZATION>Valentine</ORGANIZATION> had 33,620 votes
or <PERCENT>43 percent</PERCENT>, and his closest challenger, former <ORGANIZATION>Interior
Department</ORGANIZATION> official <PERSON>Rick Montoya</PERSON>, had 22,314 votes or <PERCENT>28.5 percent</PERCENT>.
   The AIDS measure, backed by extremist <PERSON>Lyndon LaRouche</PERSON>, was one
of a slew of propositions in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>. With <PERCENT>100 percent</PERCENT> of the
precincts in, it was soundly defeated by 3,604,180 votes or <PERCENT>68
percent</PERCENT> to 1,690,973 votes or <PERCENT>32 percent</PERCENT>.
   Also rejected were proposals to relax limits on government
spending, and local measures to shut down the Rancho Seco nuclear
power plant and split mammoth <LOCATION>San Bernardino County</LOCATION> in two.
However, voters approved two state measures to cap campaign
spending.
   In <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>, Mayor <PERSON>Maureen O'Connor</PERSON> won a full four-year term.
With <PERCENT>38.1 percent</PERCENT> of the vote counted, she had 36,179 votes or <PERCENT>58.3
percent</PERCENT>, and her closest rival, former Councilman <PERSON>Floyd Morrow</PERSON>, had
21,334 votes or <PERCENT>34.4 percent</PERCENT>.
   <LOCATION>Newark</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>City</LOCATION> Councilman <PERSON>Donald Payne</PERSON> defeated a fellow
black councilman, <PERSON>Ralph Grant</PERSON>, to capture the Democratic nomination
for the seat held by Rep. <PERSON>Peter Rodino</PERSON> for 40 years. Payne will be
an overwhelming favorite against Republican <PERSON>Michael Webb</PERSON>, who also
is black.
   ``It gives our delegation the fairness it's been lacking for
many years,'' <PERSON>Payne</PERSON> said of the fact that he stands to become the
state's first black congressman. ``I can speak from a true urban
perspective.''
   With <PERCENT>98 percent</PERCENT> of the vote counted, <PERSON>Payne</PERSON> had 39,681 votes or
<PERCENT>73 percent</PERCENT> and Grant had 14,576 votes or <PERCENT>27 percent</PERCENT>.
   In <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Judge</PERSON> defeated five other Democrats who were enticed
into the race by the retirement of two-term Gov. <PERSON>Ted Schwinden</PERSON>.
   ``People remember we had eight good years,'' said <PERSON>Judge</PERSON>, who
served from 1973-1981 and was beaten by Schwinden in the <DATE>1980</DATE>
primary. He said he also had ``put forth a program that the people
of this state have been waiting for.''
   The <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> primary victor, former state <PERSON>Sen. Stan Stephens</PERSON>, said
<PERSON>Judge</PERSON> ``represents an administration from yesteryear.''
   With <PERCENT>99 percent</PERCENT> of precincts reporting, <PERSON>Judge</PERSON> had 45,826 votes
or <PERCENT>39.3 percent</PERCENT>, former <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court Justice Frank Morrison</ORGANIZATION> had
31,718 votes or <PERCENT>27.2 percent</PERCENT> and Attorney General <PERSON>Mike Greely</PERSON> had
26,497 votes or <PERCENT>22.7 percent</PERCENT>.

Winslow</LOCATION> had 37,451 votes or <PERCENT>43.2 percent</PERCENT>. The early favorite,
Secretary of State <PERSON>Jim Waltermire</PERSON>, was killed in a plane crash in
<DATE>April</DATE>, but his name was on the ballot and he had 6,045 votes or <PERCENT>7
percent</PERCENT>.
   Here are highlights from the other states that voted:
   <LOCATION>ALABAMA</LOCATION> _ Circuit <PERSON>Judge Mark Kennedy</PERSON>, a son-in-law of former
Gov. <PERSON>George C. Wallace</PERSON>, won the Democratic nomination to state
<ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> on a slate supported by trial lawyers and opposed by
big business and insurance companies.
   IOWA _ Sixteen LaRouche supporters ran in Democratic primaries,
losing all five congressional nominations they sought and nine of

where they were unopposed.
   SOUTH DAKOTA _ No statewide races were on the ballot and there

   <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>'s Republicans on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> chose
<PERSON>Conrad Burns</PERSON>, a county commissioner from Billings, to challenge
Democratic <PERSON>Sen. John Melcher</PERSON>, who smothered an obscure challenge in
his party's primary.
   Former Gov. <PERSON>Thomas Judge</PERSON> won the Democratic primary to vie for
the succession of retiring two-term Democratic Gov. <PERSON>Ted Schwinden</PERSON>,
and former state <PERSON>Sen. Stan Stephens</PERSON> won the <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION>'s gubernatorial
primary to oppose him.
   In the presidential primaries, <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON>Michael Dukakis</PERSON>
easily outdistanced <PERSON>Jesse Jackson</PERSON> in the Democratic contest for
<LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>'s 19 delegates, while Vice President <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON> walked away
in <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> voting.
   <PERSON>Melcher</PERSON>, 64, seeking a third <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> term, put down an
underfinanced and barely visible challenge from <PERSON>Robert Kelleher</PERSON>, a
Billings lawyer.
   Burns beat <PERSON>Thomas Faranda</PERSON>, a Minnesotan who filed for the <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION>
nomination but gave up his absentee bid weeks ago, though his name
remained on the ballot.
   <PERSON>Melcher</PERSON> said the difference between him and <PERSON>Burns</PERSON> was experience.
``I think it's pretty obvious I've been here awhile,'' he said.
``He's going to try and say that's a disadvantage, but I don't
really think it is.
   ``The longer you're here, the more chances you have to get bills
passed ... that will benefit <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>,'' he said in a telephone
interview from his suburban outside <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION>
   With 641 of 982 precincts, or <PERCENT>65 percent</PERCENT>, reporting, <PERSON>Melcher</PERSON> had
55,011 votes or <PERCENT>74.7 percent</PERCENT> compared to 18,609 or <PERCENT>25.3 percent</PERCENT> for
<PERSON>Kelleher</PERSON>; <PERSON>Burns</PERSON> had 38,026 votes or <PERCENT>84.0 percent</PERCENT> to 7,270 votes or
<PERCENT>16.0 percent</PERCENT> for Faranda.
   In the Democrats' six-candidate governor's primary, with 626
precincts reporting, or <PERCENT>64 percent</PERCENT>, <PERSON>Judge</PERSON> won with 27,251 votes, or
<PERCENT>39.5 percent</PERCENT>; former <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court Justice Frank Morrison</ORGANIZATION> had 18,806
votes or <PERCENT>27.2 percent</PERCENT> and Attorney General <PERSON>Mike Greeley</PERSON> had 15,607

vote.
   In the Republican gubernatorial primary, former state <PERSON>Sen. Stan
Stephens</PERSON> won with 25,674 votes, or <PERCENT>48.9 percent</PERCENT> to state Rep. <LOCATION>Cal
Winslow</LOCATION>'s 23,168 votes, or <PERCENT>44.2 percent</PERCENT>.
   Also seeking the Democratic gubernatorial nomination were State
<PERSON>Sen. Ted Neuman</PERSON>, <PERSON>Emmett</PERSON> ``Curly'' <PERSON>Thornton</PERSON>, an ex-drug addict turned

<HEAD>Seven States Vote In Year's Biggest State Primary Day So Far</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Inserts 1 graf after 5th graf, `New Jersey ...,' to UPDATE
with light turnout today in New Jersey.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MIKE SILVERMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Primary voters today narrow the fields in four <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Senate races,
choose nominees for governor of <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> and pick a black Democratic
candidate for the <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> congressional seat occupied by <PERSON>Peter
Rodino</PERSON> for 40 years.
   In other highlights of voting in seven states, Californians
decide a large crop of propositions, including a measure sponsored
by supporters of extremist <PERSON>Lyndon LaRouche</PERSON> that would permit the
state to quarantine AIDS victims. Sacramento voters could become the
first in the nation to close a nuclear power plant, the troubled
Rancho Seco; and voters in <LOCATION>San Bernardino County</LOCATION> _ the nation's
largest _ will decide whether to carve away the eastern, desert
portion to create a new county called Mojave.
   In <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>, the nation's seventh-largest city, Mayor <PERSON>Maureen
O'Connor</PERSON> is expected to win a four-year term by gaining a majority
in the nonpartisan primary. She was first elected two years ago
after Mayor <PERSON>Roger Hedgecock</PERSON> was convicted of a felony and forced to
resign.
   Both of the nation's first-term Democrats are among the senators
with a stake in today's races, and both have been targeted as
vulnerable by the national <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>Frank Lautenberg</PERSON> of <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> has
two little-known primary opponents, and <PERSON>Jeff Bingaman</PERSON> of <LOCATION>New Mexico</LOCATION>
has none.
   New Jersey Republicans have united behind a single nominee, <PERSON>Peter
Dawkins</PERSON>, a former Heisman trophy winner, <PERSON>Rhodes</PERSON> scholar and <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>
war hero who moved to the state to enter the race.
   Voting officials in <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> reported a light turnout <TIME>this
morning</TIME> for the primary races.
   In <LOCATION>New Mexico</LOCATION>, four Republicans are competing for the chance to
face <PERSON>Bingaman</PERSON>. A poll taken last week for the <LOCATION>Albuquerque</LOCATION> Journal
showed state <PERSON>Sen. Bill Valentine</PERSON> leading the field with support of
<PERCENT>29.5 percent</PERCENT> of Republicans, but <PERCENT>38.9 percent</PERCENT> were undecided.
   A third first-term senator seeking re-election is Republican <PERSON>Pete
Wilson</PERSON> of <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>. He has no primary competition, but does have a
jinx to worry about _ for 30 years, no one holding his <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> seat
has been elected more than once. On the Democratic side, Lt. Gov.
<PERSON>Leo McCarthy</PERSON> is expected to dispatch three little-known opponents.
   <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> also has a <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> race, with two-term Democrat <PERSON>John
Melcher</PERSON> opposed in the primary by attorney <PERSON>Robert Kelleher</PERSON>, who
advocates a parliamentary form of government. Yellowstone County
Commissioner <PERSON>Conrad Burns</PERSON> is the only <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> entrant.
   But the liveliest race in <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> is for governor, since Democrat
<PERSON>Ted Schwinden</PERSON>'s decision to retire after two terms has left the
ballot without an incumbent for the first time in 20 years.
   The six-way Democratic field features a comeback bid by former
Gov. <PERSON>Thomas Judge</PERSON>, who served two terms before losing to Schwinden
in the <DATE>primary eight years ago</DATE>. A <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> Poll taken last week
showed <PERSON>Judge</PERSON> was the choice of <PERCENT>28 percent</PERCENT> of Democratic voters, but
<PERCENT>35 percent</PERCENT> were undecided.
   In the two-way Republican race, the poll showed a dead heat
between former state <PERSON>Sen. Stan Stephens</PERSON> and state Rep. <LOCATION>Cal Winslow</LOCATION>.
The <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> favorite, Secretary of State <PERSON>Jim Waltermire</PERSON>, was killed in a
plane crash in <DATE>April</DATE>.
   The retirement of <PERSON>Rodino</PERSON>, whose 79th birthday is today, comes
amid growing sentiment that his predominantly black district should
be represented by the state's first black congressman. Two black
<LOCATION>Newark</LOCATION> city councilmen, <PERSON>Donald Payne</PERSON> and <PERSON>Ralph Grant</PERSON>, are competing
in the Democratic primary, with the winner expected to defeat the
<ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> nominee, political newcomer <PERSON>Michael Webb</PERSON>, who also is black.
   Here is a look at the other states voting today:
   <LOCATION>ALABAMA</LOCATION> _ Democratic Reps. <PERSON>Claude Harris</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Tuscaloosa</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Bill
Nichols</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Sylacauga</LOCATION> are favored to turn back primary challenges.
   Races for three <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> seats have turned into unusually
rough-and-tumble scraps in which big business and insurance
companies are backing one slate of Democrats, while trial lawyers
and less conservative interests are backing another. One of the
candidates with trial lawyer support is Circuit <PERSON>Judge Mark Kennedy</PERSON>
of <LOCATION>Montgomery</LOCATION>, a son-in-law of former Gov. <PERSON>George C. Wallace</PERSON>. He is
running against <LOCATION>Anniston</LOCATION> lawyer <PERSON>A.W. Bolt</PERSON>, who is supported by
business lobbies, for an associate justice post.
   IOWA _ Sixteen LaRouche supporters are running in Democratic
primaries, five for congressional nominations and the rest in state
legislative districts. Four Democrats are seeking the nomination to
oppose first-term GOP Rep. <PERSON>Fred Grandy</PERSON>, who for years played Gopher
on television's ``The Love Boat.''
   SOUTH <LOCATION>DAKOTA</LOCATION> _ The state is having one of its quietest elections
in memory, with no statewide races on the ballot. And there are only
26 primary races for the 105 state <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> seats. The
state's lone congressman, Democratic Rep. <PERSON>Tim Johnson</PERSON>, is unopposed
in the primary as is his Republican challenger, state Treasurer
<PERSON>David Volk</PERSON>.

   <PERSON>Dianne Feinstein</PERSON> and <PERSON>John Van de Kamp</PERSON> brawled to the wire for one
of <DATE>1990</DATE>'s biggest political prizes, the Democratic nomination for
governor of <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, and voters set lineups <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> for fall
contests in eight other states.
   The busiest primary night so far this campaign year saw <LOCATION>North
Carolina</LOCATION> Democrats deciding whether former <LOCATION>Charlotte</LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON>Harvey
Gantt</PERSON> or county prosecutor <PERSON>Mike Easley</PERSON> would get the formidable task
of challenging Republican <PERSON>Sen. Jesse Helms</PERSON>.
   <PERSON>Gantt</PERSON> was bidding to become the first black nominated for <ORGANIZATION>U.S.
Senate</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION> <DATE>this century</DATE>.
   ``I'm ready to get into this fight'' with <PERSON>Helms</PERSON>, <PERSON>Gantt</PERSON> said as he
cast his own ballot. ``I'm ready to get it on with him.''
   <PERSON>Feinstein</PERSON>, the former mayor of <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, and Van de Kamp,
the state attorney general, have spent <MONEY>millions of dollars</MONEY> battling
each other and now the winner will plunge into an even more costly
and just as nasty general election race against Republican <PERSON>Sen. Pete
Wilson</PERSON>. He is trying to keep the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> governor's office in <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION>
control.
   Voters also were choosing nominees in <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>South Dakota</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New Mexico</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION>.
   As usual, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> voters also were making decisions on ballot
propositions, including two that would strip the legislature of most
of its power to redraw legislative, including congressional,
district lines. <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> is likely to gain six <ORGANIZATION>U.S. House</ORGANIZATION> seats as
a result of the <DATE>1990</DATE> Census.
   Another <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> ballot proposal would double the gasoline tax
over the next five years and was being watched as a signal of a
shift in sentiment in the state where the anti-tax revolt began in
the <DATE>1970s</DATE>.
   Seven senators and three governors were on ballots, none with
serious primary opposition.
   The senators were Democrats <PERSON>Bill Bradley</PERSON> of <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Howell
Heflin</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Max Baucus</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Tom Harkin</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>. The
Republicans were <PERSON>Larry Pressler</PERSON> of <LOCATION>South Dakota</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Pete Domenici</PERSON> of
<LOCATION>New Mexico</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Thad Cochran</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION>.
   Long in advance of their formal nomination in the primary, <PERSON>Harkin</PERSON>
and Republican Rep. <PERSON>Tom Tauke</PERSON> began campaigning against each other
in what looks like one of the tightest <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> races of the year.
   Alabama Republican <PERSON>Bill Cabannis</PERSON> was geared to challenge <PERSON>Heflin</PERSON>
and Democrat <PERSON>Ted Muenster</PERSON> was taking on Pressler in <LOCATION>South Dakota</LOCATION>.
   In <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>, Lt. Gov. <PERSON>Allen Kolstad</PERSON> and businessman <PERSON>Bruce Vorhauer</PERSON>
were the leading contenders for the Republican nomination to
challenge <PERSON>Baucus</PERSON>.
   Scores of primaries also were deciding the lineups for elections
to the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION>. One incumbent who faced a strong challenge was
Democratic Rep. <PERSON>Jim Bates</PERSON> of <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>, who was rebuked by the <ORGANIZATION>House
Ethics Committee</ORGANIZATION> for sexual harassment of women employees.
   One of the hottest primaries for a congressional seat was in the
<LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> district represented by <PERSON>James Courter</PERSON>, the unsuccessful
GOP candidate for governor in <DATE>1989</DATE>. Courter is not seeking
re-election to the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> and the Republican contenders to succeed
him include Assemblyman <PERSON>Rodney Frelinghuysen</PERSON>, state <PERSON>Sen. Richard A.
Zimmer</PERSON> and professional football player <PERSON>Phil McConkey</PERSON>.
   <PERSON>Marguerite Chandler</PERSON> was unopposed for the Democratic nomination.
   Gov. Guy Hunt of <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION>, the first Republican elected to that
office this century, was bidding for a second term and a crowded
field of Democrats was vying to challenge him.
   Former Gov. <PERSON>Fob James</PERSON>, educator-lobbyist <PERSON>Paul Hubbert</PERSON>, Rep.
<PERSON>Ronnie Flippo</PERSON>, and Attorney General <PERSON>Don Siegelman</PERSON> were the leading
contenders. No one was expected to get the clear majority needed to
avoid a <DATE>June 26</DATE> runoff.
   In a race in which abortion was a major issue, <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION> Democrats
were choosing among Attorney General <PERSON>Tom Miller</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON>Don
Avenson</PERSON> and banker <PERSON>John Chrystal</PERSON> for the nomination to challenge
Republican Gov. <PERSON>Terry Branstad</PERSON>.
   Avenson and <PERSON>Chrystal</PERSON> support the pro-choice position, while
<PERSON>Miller</PERSON> and <PERSON>Branstad</PERSON> are abortion opponents.
   Republican Gov. <PERSON>Garrey Carruthers</PERSON> of <LOCATION>New Mexico</LOCATION> was ineligible to
seek re-election. Four Democrats, including former Gov. <PERSON>Bruce King</PERSON>,
and four Republicans were competing to succeed him. The next
governor will be the first allowed to serve two consecutive
four-year terms.

<TEXT>
   Skirmishes over four <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Senate seats, a wide-open race for
<LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> governor and a <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> potpourri of propositions
highlight the ballots in seven states <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, the busiest state
primary day so far in <DATE>1988</DATE>.
   In <LOCATION>Newark</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>, two black Democrats are competing for their
party's nomination to the congressional seat being vacated by <PERSON>Peter
Rodino</PERSON> after 40 years. In <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>, Mayor <PERSON>Maureen O'Connor</PERSON> is
overwhelmingly favored to win election in a nonpartisan race to a
full four-year term.
   The <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> propositions include statewide measures that would
permit the quarantining of AIDS victims, ease the government
spending limits imposed by Proposition 13 a decade ago, and cap
runaway spending on political campaigns.
   In local measures of note, <LOCATION>Sacramento</LOCATION> voters could become the
first in the nation to close a nuclear power plant, the troubled
Rancho Seco facility; and voters in <LOCATION>San Bernardino County</LOCATION> _ the
nation's largest county _ will decide whether to carve away the
eastern, desert portion to create a new county called Mojave.
   The most hotly contested <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> primary is in <LOCATION>New Mexico</LOCATION>, where
four Republicans think first-term Democratic <PERSON>Sen. Jeff Bingaman</PERSON> is
vulnerable because of his liberal voting record in a state that
strongly supports defense spending. State <PERSON>Sen. Bill Valentine</PERSON> and
longtime party activist <PERSON>Corky Morris</PERSON> have held the lead in polls for
the <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> nomination. Bingaman is unopposed in the Democratic primary.
   The only other first-term Democrat seeking re-election this year,
<PERSON>Sen. Frank Lautenberg</PERSON> of <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION>, faces a challenge from two
little-known primary opponents. He is gearing up for his <DATE>November</DATE>
clash with the unopposed GOP nominee, <PERSON>Peter Dawkins</PERSON>, a Heisman
Trophy winner, <PERSON>Rhodes</PERSON> scholar and <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> War hero who resigned from
the Shearson-Lehman brokerage house in <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION> last year and
moved to <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION>.
   The national <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> has targeted both <PERSON>Bingaman</PERSON> and <PERSON>Lautenberg</PERSON>, and
both states have Republican governors who will campaign for the
party's nominee.
   In <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, Republican <PERSON>Sen. Pete Wilson</PERSON> has no primary hurdle
as he seeks a second term, but he will have to overcome a jinx in
<DATE>November</DATE> _ for more than 30 years, no one has been re-elected to
that particular <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> seat. On the Democratic side, Lt. Gov. <PERSON>Leo
McCarthy</PERSON> faces two political unknowns.
   The fourth <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> race is in <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>, where Democrat <PERSON>John Melcher</PERSON>
is seeking the nomination for a third term. His only primary
challenger is attorney <PERSON>Robert Kelleher</PERSON>, who advocates a
parliamentary form of government. The unopposed <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> candidate is
<PERSON>Conrad Burns</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Yellowstone County</LOCATION> commissioner and former
broadcaster.
   <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> also features a lively race for governor, a post held by
Democrats for 20 years. Two-term Gov. <PERSON>Ted Schwinden</PERSON>'s decision not
to run for a third term gave Republicans hope of recapturing the
office, but their leading candidate, Secretary of State <PERSON>Jim
Waltermire</PERSON>, was killed in an <DATE>April</DATE> plane crash. The remaining GOP
contenders are former state <PERSON>Sen. Stan Stephens</PERSON> and state Rep. <LOCATION>Cal
Winslow</LOCATION>.
   The six-man Democratic field includes a comeback bid by former
Gov. <PERSON>Thomas Judge</PERSON>, who lost to Schwinden in the <DATE>1980</DATE> primary. The
two other leading candidates are Attorney General <PERSON>Mike Greely</PERSON>, who
has a drunken driving conviction on his record, and former state
<ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court Justice Frank Morrison Jr</ORGANIZATION>.
   Here is a look at the other states voting <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>:
   <LOCATION>ALABAMA</LOCATION> _ Democratic Reps. <PERSON>Claude Harris</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Tuscaloosa</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Bill
Nichols</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Sylacauga</LOCATION> are favored to turn back primary challenges.
   Races for three <ORGANIZATION>Alabama Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> seats have turned into
unusually rough-and-tumble scraps in which big business and
insurance companies are backing one slate of Democratic candidates,
while trial lawyers and less conservative interests are backing
another slate. One of the candidates with trial lawyer support is
Circuit <PERSON>Judge Mark Kennedy</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Montgomery</LOCATION>, a son-in-law of former
Gov. <PERSON>George C. Wallace</PERSON>. He is running against <LOCATION>Anniston</LOCATION> lawyer <PERSON>A.W.
Bolt</PERSON>, who is supported by business lobbies, for an associate justice
post.
   IOWA _ Sixteen supporters of political extremist <PERSON>Lyndon LaRouche</PERSON>
are running in Democratic primaries, five for congressional
nominations and the rest in state legislative districts. Four
Democrats are seeking the nomination to oppose first-term GOP Rep.
<PERSON>Fred Grandy</PERSON>, who for years played Gopher on television's ``The Love
Boat.''
   SOUTH <LOCATION>DAKOTA</LOCATION> _ The state is having one of its quietest elections
in memory, with no statewide races on the ballot. And there are only
26 primary races for the 105 state <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> seats. The
state's lone congressman, Democratic Rep. <PERSON>Tim Johnson</PERSON>, is unopposed
in the primary as is his Republican challenger, state Treasurer
<PERSON>David Volk</PERSON>.

   Four <LOCATION>New Mexico</LOCATION> Republicans compete for a chance to challenge
Democratic <PERSON>Sen. Jeff Bingaman</PERSON> and former <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON>Thomas Judge</PERSON>
puts his comeback hopes on the line <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, as seven states hold
primaries for state and local office.
   Senate races also are on tap in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>, while voters in <LOCATION>Actims</LOCATION>, and proposals to ease state spending limits
and curb
campaign spending.
   Locally, <LOCATION>Sacramento</LOCATION> voters could decide to close the Rancho Seco
nuclear power plant; <LOCATION>San Bernardino County</LOCATION> voters could split the
nation's largest county into two; and voters in seven <LOCATION>Southern
California</LOCATION> communities could impose limits on growth or force
developers to pay for it.
   <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON>Maureen O'Connor</PERSON>, who won a special election two
years ago after <PERSON>Roger Hedgecock</PERSON> was convicted of a felony, is
seeking a full four-year term. She is expected to win a majority in
the non-partisan primary and thus avoid a runoff.
   In <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION>, Democratic Rep. <PERSON>Peter Rodino</PERSON> is giving up his seat
after 20 terms amid growing sentiment that his Newark-area district
should be represented by the state's first black congressman. Two
black <LOCATION>Newark</LOCATION> city councilmen, <PERSON>Donald Payne</PERSON> and <PERSON>Ralph Grant</PERSON>, are
competing in the Democratic primary, with the winner expected to
defeat the <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> nominee, political newcomer <PERSON>Michael Webb</PERSON>, who also is
black.
   In <LOCATION>New Mexico</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>GOP Senate</ORGANIZATION> race, state <PERSON>Sen. Bill Valentine</PERSON> led
the four-candidate field in a poll taken last week for the
<ORGANIZATION>Albuquerque Journal</ORGANIZATION>. The national <ORGANIZATION>Republican Party</ORGANIZATION> has targeted
<PERSON>Bingaman</PERSON> as vulnerable because he is a first-term liberal Democrat.
Bingaman has no primary opposition.
   The <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> also has designs on another first-term Democratic
senator, <PERSON>Frank Lautenberg</PERSON> of <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION>, who faces two little-known
candidates in <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>'s primary. The only Republican contender is
<PERSON>Peter Dawkins</PERSON>, a former star athlete, <PERSON>Rhodes</PERSON> scholar and <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> War
hero who moved to <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> last year from <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> to run for
office.
   A third Democratic senator seeking re-election is <PERSON>John Melcher</PERSON> of
<LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>. To win a third term he must overcome attorney <PERSON>Robert
Kelleher</PERSON> in the primary and Republican <PERSON>Conrad Burns</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Yellowstone
County</LOCATION> commissioner, in <DATE>November</DATE>.
   <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>'s GOP <PERSON>Sen. Pete Wilson</PERSON> has no primary opponent, and
will likely face Democratic Lt. Gov. <PERSON>Leo McCarthy</PERSON>, who is running
against three political unknowns. <PERSON>Wilson</PERSON> has led in the polls, but
no one has been re-elected to his <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> seat for 30 years.
   In <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>'s race for governor, <ORGANIZATION>Judge</ORGANIZATION> is one of six Democrats
seeking the nomination for the seat two-term Gov. <PERSON>Ted Schwinden</PERSON> is
relinquishing. Schwinden had defeated Judge in the <DATE>1980</DATE> Democratic
primary.
   A <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> Poll taken last week showed <PERSON>Judge</PERSON> was the choice of <PERCENT>28
percent</PERCENT> of Democratic voters, but <PERCENT>35 percent</PERCENT> were undecided.
   In the two-way Republican race, the poll showed a dead heat

Republicans have not won the governorship in 20 years and the <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION>
favorite, Secretary of State <PERSON>Jim Waltermire</PERSON>, was killed in a plane

<HEAD>Reagan Pocket Veto of Wilderness Bill Could Work Against GOP, Dems
Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE DENNISON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HELENA, Mont. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>'s decision to pocket veto a
wilderness bill that would have released 4.1 million acres of land
for development could backfire against state <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> candidates, say
hopeful Democrats.
   But Republicans, who sought the veto claiming the bill did not
free up enough land, are looking to harvest votes from <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>'s
action _ only the second such veto in his eight years in office.
   Reagan announced <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> he would not sign a bill designating
1.43 million acres of roadless national forest land in <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> as
federally protected wilderness. It was only the second time he has
vetoed a state wilderness bill. He has signed more than 30.
   More than 6 million acres of <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> wilderness have been closed
to development because of federal court decisions in the late <DATE>1970s</DATE>
and early <DATE>1980s</DATE>. A wilderness bill from <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> is needed to
release any of this land for other use; the bill vetoed by <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>,
by protecting 1.43 million acres, would have freed up the remaining
land.
   The <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> denied the veto decision was political. But first
word of the veto came not from the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> but from <PERSON>Conrad
Burns</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> challenger to <PERSON>Sen. John Melcher</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-Mont.</LOCATION>, who
sponsored the wilderness legislation.
   Polls show <PERSON>Burns</PERSON> in a close race with <PERSON>Melcher</PERSON>, and <PERSON>Burns</PERSON>
campaigned heavily in recent days on what he said would have been
the legislation's negative impact on <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> jobs.
   ``As our next senator, I will hold hearings across <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> on
this critical issue and work to pass wilderness legislation that is
in the best interest of all Montanans,'' he said in a statement
released with the veto announcement.
   <PERSON>Burns</PERSON> and the Republican candidates for the state's two
congressional seats all asked <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> to veto the measure, saying it
would cost jobs by locking up too much land as wilderness and
wilderness study areas, putting miners and loggers out of work.
   Reagan offered the same explanation in his veto message and also
noted the bill designated almost twice the amount of wilderness
recommended by the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Forest Service</ORGANIZATION>.
   <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>Marlin Fitzwater</PERSON> said <DATE>Thursday</DATE> the veto
resulted from ``a variety of economic and environmental reasons,''
not politics.
   But Democrats and environmentalists said the move was political
manipulation, pointing out that nearly all wilderness bills signed
by <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> have had more wilderness acreage than recommended by the
<ORGANIZATION>Forest Service</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``This whole veto is simply part of an effort to reduce the
possibility that there might be more Democrats in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Senate
next session,'' said <PERSON>Sherm Janke</PERSON> of Bozeman, chairman of the <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>
chapter of the <ORGANIZATION>Sierra Club</ORGANIZATION>. ``The real reason is to embarrass the
candidacies of those who have supported the wilderness legislation.''
   Some Democrats predicted a backlash, noting the issue of
wilderness preservation in <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> has been debated for a decade,
with this year's bill the first potential resolution.
   ``We're looking at a process that's been going on for 13 years,
and with a lack of a stroke of a pen, <PERSON>Ronald Reagan</PERSON> has just dumped
all that in a dumpster,'' said <PERSON>Ron Richards</PERSON>, a <PERSON>Melcher</PERSON> aide. ``I
would think there's going to be some resentment among some folks.''
   Democrats say releasing the 4.1 million acres is needed to
stabilize <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>'s mining and timber industries, which are
recovering from recession in the early <DATE>1980s</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Tom Daubert</PERSON>, press secretary for the Dukakis-Bentsen campaign in
<LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>, expressed hope that the veto might convince more Montanans
to vote against Vice President and <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> presidential nominee <PERSON>George
Bush</PERSON>, who Democrats say advised <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> on the veto.
   ``<PERSON>George Bush</PERSON> has added insult to injury here,'' <PERSON>Daubert</PERSON> said.
``We've had eight years of voodoo economics, and the icing on the
cake is prolonged instability in the mining and timber industries. I
think Montanans know that jobs are at stake here.''

   Democrats, while losing the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> by
almost landslide proportions, managed to boost their majority in the
<ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> by at least one vote, and possibly two, depending on the
outcome of a cliff-hanger race in <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>.
   More than 24 hours after the polls opened for <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>'s election,
there still was no winner in the race for the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> seat in <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>
being vacated by Democrat <PERSON>Lawton Chiles</PERSON>.
   With only a portion of an estimated 100,000 absentee ballots
still uncounted among 4 million cast, Republican Rep. <PERSON>Connie Mack</PERSON>
overtook Democratic Rep. <PERSON>Buddy MacKay</PERSON> and began building a slight
lead.
   A victory by <PERSON>Mack</PERSON> would leave Democrats with 55 of the 100 <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>
seats, up one from the <DATE>54-46</DATE> majority they held during the last
<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>. Should MacKay win, Democrats would hold a 56-44 edge.
   Democrats lost seats in <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION>; Republican seats
changed parties in <LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION>.
   Even if Democrats were to lose in <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION>, where
a recount is possible, they still would have the majority, which
carries with it the chairmanship of every committee and the right to
set the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>'s agenda.
   Some key lawmakers indicated that does not necessarily spell
trouble for President-elect <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON>.
   Sen. <PERSON>Joseph R. Biden Jr.</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-Del.</LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>Judiciary
Committee</ORGANIZATION>, said he and other chairmen ``are prepared to work with
President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> and do that straight up, no holds barred, and find
whether he means what he says when he says that he expects to have a
close relationship with the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION>.''
   Sen. <PERSON>Pete Domenici</PERSON>, <LOCATION>R-N.M.</LOCATION>, predicted budget issues will dominate
the attention of the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> next year. The new president's
oft-repeated opposition to higher taxes ``will be the big sticking
point'' in his dealings with <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Domenici</PERSON> added.
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>, who regularly reviled liberals during his campaign, will
find himself having to deal with some powerful <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> liberals who
easily won re-election.
   Sen. <PERSON>Edward M. Kennedy</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-Mass.</LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>Labor and Human
Resources Committee</ORGANIZATION>, took <PERCENT>66 percent</PERCENT> of the vote in winning a fifth
six-year term. Sens. <PERSON>Donald Riegle</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-Mich.</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Banking Committee</ORGANIZATION>
chairman, and <PERSON>Quentin Burdick</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-N.D.</LOCATION>, who heads the Environment and
<ORGANIZATION>Public Works Committee</ORGANIZATION>, were re-elected with <PERCENT>61 percent</PERCENT> each.
   Another prominent liberal, <PERSON>Sen. George Mitchell</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-Maine</LOCATION>, one of
three senators vying to become majority leader in the new <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>,
won a second full term with <PERCENT>81 percent</PERCENT> of the vote.
   In fact, landslides were the order of the day in the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>
races. Twenty-two of the 33 seats up for grabs were won with at
least <PERCENT>57 percent</PERCENT> of the vote.
   <PERSON>Charles Robb</PERSON>, son-in-law of former President <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON>, was elected
in <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION>, taking the seat given up by one-term <PERSON>Sen. Paul Trible</PERSON>,
a Republican. In <LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION>, a famous son, <PERSON>Hubert H. Humphrey III</PERSON>,
failed in his bid to unseat Republican <PERSON>David Durenberger</PERSON>, who has
served in the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> since <DATE>1978</DATE>.
   The most liberal Republican senator, <PERSON>Lowell Weicker</PERSON> of
<LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION>, who served 18 years, lost by 10,052 votes to Democrat
<PERSON>Joseph Lieberman</PERSON>, the state attorney general, who campaigned as a
backer of some initiatives of the <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> administration. There had
been talk of a recount, but the final spread was not close enough to
warrant that.
   In <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>, Democratic <PERSON>Sen. John Melcher</PERSON>, first elected to
<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1969</DATE>, was upset by <PERSON>Conrad Burns</PERSON>, a former farm
broadcaster who accused <PERSON>Melcher</PERSON> of being too liberal. Burns becomes
the state's first GOP senator in 36 years.
   Veteran Republican Rep. <PERSON>Trent Lott</PERSON> defeated Democratic Rep. <PERSON>Wayne
Dowdy</PERSON> to win the seat being vacated by the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>'s most senior
member, Democrat <PERSON>John C. Stennis</PERSON>.
   Nevada voters retired Republican <PERSON>Sen. Chic Hecht</PERSON> after one term,
replacing him with Democratic Gov. <PERSON>Richard Bryan</PERSON>.
   In <LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION>, appointed <PERSON>Sen. David Karnes</PERSON>, a Republican, lost to
<PERSON>Bob Kerrey</PERSON>, a popular former governor and <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> war hero.
   While 10 new senators were elected <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, there will be 11 new
faces when the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> convenes in <DATE>January</DATE>. The governor of <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION>
will name a successor to <PERSON>Sen. Dan Quayle</PERSON>, who was elected vice
president.
   The other results:
   <LOCATION>ARIZONA</LOCATION>: <PERSON>Sen. Dennis DeConcini</PERSON>, a Democrat and one of the
wealthiest senators, won <PERCENT>61 percent</PERCENT> of the vote and a third term.
   CALIFORNIA: First-term Republican <PERSON>Sen. Pete Wilson</PERSON> had an

number of acres involved under the bill, UPDATE with additional
detail</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> exercised pocket vetoes
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE> on a bill designating 1.43 million acres of <ORGANIZATION>Forest Service</ORGANIZATION>
land in <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> as wilderness as well as on a measure establishing a
corporation to provide development capital to Indian businesses, the
<ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> announced.
   By exercising the pocket vetoes after <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> adjourned for the
year, there is no chance of overrides.
   In a statement concerning the <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> wilderness bill, <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>
said, ``Enactment of the bill would injure the economy of <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>.
It could cost jobs and eliminate vast mineral development
opportunities. It also would reduce the flexibility the federal
government needs in managing the nation's natural heritage.''
   <PERSON>Sen. Max Baucus</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-Mont.</LOCATION>, who co-sponsored the measure with
fellow <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> Democratic <PERSON>Sen. John Melcher</PERSON>, accused <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> and Vice
President <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON>'s presidential campaign of playing politics
with the bill.
   ``This is an affront to the people of <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>,'' <PERSON>Baucus</PERSON> said
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> in a statement read by press secretary <PERSON>Scott
Williams</PERSON>. ``This bill was vetoed for petty politics, and that's all.
... Clearly, the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> campaign had a hand in this. The vice
president is still a member of the environmental wrecking crew.''
   The wilderness bill, passed by voice vote in both chambers of
<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> _ the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Oct. 18</DATE> and the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Oct. 20</DATE> _ would
have affected more than 6 million acres of <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> and was the
result of a compromise worked out among competing interests,
including conservationists and the timber and lumber industries.
   The measure designated about 1.43 million acres of <ORGANIZATION>Forest Service</ORGANIZATION>
land as wilderness; 360,400 acres as special management areas,
meaning recreation; and 320,700 acres as federal study areas. It
also released for non-wilderness uses _ such as timber harvesting
and mineral exploration _ another 4 million acres in <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>'s 10
national forests.
   Reagan's veto was lauded by a northwest <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> logger, <PERSON>Bruce
Vincent</PERSON>, who called it ``a real victory for the citizens of <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>
and the families and communities who had a lot at stake.''
   Also supporting the veto was <PERSON>Conrad Burns</PERSON>, the Republican running
against <PERSON>Melcher</PERSON> for a <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> seat. <PERSON>Burns</PERSON> said the bill was vetoed
not for political reasons, but because it would cost jobs in <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>.
   ``If there were any politics involved in this, it was <PERSON>John
Melcher</PERSON> holding this bill up all year long and introducing it in the
11th hour, without holding hearings on it,'' <PERSON>Burns</PERSON> said in <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>.
   Melcher criticized <PERSON>Burns</PERSON> as the one playing politics, saying,
``We don't really need to make this political. We've had a hard
enough time passing a bill with all the competing interests in
<LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>. To add another dimension with the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> ... well,
it's pretty tough.''
   <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> said the administration's <ORGANIZATION>National Forest System Land and
Resource Management Plans</ORGANIZATION> for <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> already strike the appropriate
balance among competing economic, environmental and cultural
interests. The legislation, he said, ``would have severely disrupted
that balance.''
   In addition, the president said, the measure would have limited
the government's ability ``to obtain strategic and critical minerals
... necessary to supply military, industrial and essential civilian
needs during national defense emergencies....''
   <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> argued that the federal government would have given up
revenue-producing land in favor of non-revenue-producing land, thus
increasing the federal deficit.
   The president said he was withholding his approval of the bill
creating the <ORGANIZATION>Indian Development Finance Corp.</ORGANIZATION> because it ``would
have created an expensive and unnecessary new bureaucracy and
duplicated currently existing programs.''
   The measure to provide development capital to Indian businesses
would not have addressed the underlying problems of economic
development for Indians, <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> said, while placing ``the government
at risk of substantial financial loss.'' The bill ``does not provide
sufficient authority for government oversight of the financial
activities that could result in such loss.''
   Instead of creating a new institution, <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> said, better use
should be made of existing sources of capital such as the Indian
Financing Act. He noted that he recently signed a bill which
increased the ceiling on loans and loan guarantees under that act.
   The section of the bill that transferred federal land in <LOCATION>Southern
California</LOCATION> to several bands of <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION> mission Indians
was unaffected by the pocket veto, <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> said, because that also
was included in the omnibus Indian affairs bill that he approved
earlier.

   Democratic <PERSON>Sen. Max Baucus</PERSON> said he prepared
for a tough race, but ended up with a pushover, downing Republican
<PERSON>Allen Kolstad</PERSON> by a better than 2-to-1 margin.
   With <PERCENT>92 percent</PERCENT> of precincts reporting, <PERSON>Baucus</PERSON> had 201,489
votes, or <PERCENT>70 percent</PERCENT>. Kolstad, <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>'s lieutenant governor, had

   Baucus returns to <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> for his third term. He said he
focused his campaign on convincing voters he was working to lessen

   <PERSON>Kolstad</PERSON> said he ran a hard, honest campaign but was outgunned by

for running a deceptive campaign.
   Meanwhile, <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> voters on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> defeated an initiative that

also re-elected the state's incumbent congressmen - one Democrat

   It was just like old times when <PERSON>John Melcher</PERSON>
got together with agribusiness consultant <PERSON>Martin Sorkin</PERSON> for lunch at
the Watergate the other day.
   With one glaring exception.
   ``I told him that this time I would pay, and I did, indeed,
pay,'' confesses the 64-year-old Democrat, who last <DATE>November</DATE> lost
his bid for a third <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> term from <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>.
   Gone are the days when <PERSON>Melcher</PERSON>, an affable, white-haired
veterinarian known as ``Doc,'' could assume that the lunch tab would
be picked up by someone else.
   ``They used to call me,'' says the Democratic veteran of 12 years
in the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> and seven in the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>. ``Now I call them.''
   It was a close election. A turnaround of 7,000 votes would have
given <PERSON>Melcher</PERSON> a new, six-year lease on his <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> office.
   But <PERSON>Melcher</PERSON> ran into a <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> challenger, <PERSON>Conrad Burns</PERSON>, who was a
popular farm broadcaster at a time when his own base in the Grain
Belt was getting shaky after four years of drought and unpopular
policies blamed on <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>.
   Television ads featuring talking cows that boosted <PERSON>Melcher</PERSON> in
<DATE>1982</DATE> proved a bust this time in a state anxious to shed its bucolic
image and spotlight an above-average education level as a means to
lure new, high-tech industries.
   Melcher also declares ruefully that he played into Republican
hands in dealing with a sensitive bill to preserve <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>
wilderness areas. He ended up losing support among both
conservations and the lumber industry.
   When the election was over, so was <PERSON>Melcher</PERSON>'s congressional
career. His colleagues gave him a loyal sendoff.
   ``He has protected the rights of farmers in <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> and fought
for fairness in public power systems,'' declared <PERSON>Sen. Christopher
Dodd</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-Conn.</LOCATION>, in a farewell to <PERSON>Melcher</PERSON> from the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> floor.
   Fast <PERSON>Eddie</PERSON> and <PERSON>Abigail</PERSON>, a pair of cats that had romped through
his office at will in happier times, also had to go. An aide took
one and the senator himself bundled the other into his car and took
it to live in his suburban <LOCATION>Maryland</LOCATION> home.
   Then <PERSON>Melcher</PERSON> sat down to write letters and make phone calls on
behalf of aides already looking for new jobs. About half are now
employed while others are still hunting or have decided the time has
come to retire.
   Melcher himself is not planning to retire and there are two
reasons why.
   ``I have to earn some money,'' he says. ``I can live off my
retirement in <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> but if I want to stay here I've got to do
something.''
   Moving back to <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>, he says, would provide him with a more
pleasant place to live. But that would mean saying goodbye to the
issues that he has been campaigning for over almost two decades.
That is the second reason why he refuses to retire.
   Working off a borrowed desk in a downtown law firm, <PERSON>Melcher</PERSON> is
offering his services as a consultant on those issues. That is, as a
lobbyist.
   ``Well, call it what you may,'' he says, ``I think we have a
tendency to say consult but it's lobbying.''
   In that, <PERSON>Melcher</PERSON> is like scores of former lawmakers who stay on
in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> after they retire or lose elections _ they move into
downtown suites and earn their living as hired guns in the
never-ending battle of <ORGANIZATION>Gucci Gulch</ORGANIZATION>.
   Senate rules designed to head off conflicts of interest bar
<PERSON>Melcher</PERSON> from contacting his former <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> colleagues about bills for
one year. But he is free to testify when their committees hold
hearings on bills. And he is free to ply the corridors of the
<ORGANIZATION>Agriculture Department</ORGANIZATION> on behalf of clients.
   Melcher already has one client, the <ORGANIZATION>Society for Animal Protection
Legislation</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``I have a profound interest in the well-being of primates that
are used in medical experiments,'' says <PERSON>Melcher</PERSON>. He says they
deserve decent surroundings and the company of their fellow
creatures.
   A broader plan <PERSON>Melcher</PERSON> is working on would establish a coalition
to fight potential cuts in the Food for Peace program, an
<ORGANIZATION>Agriculture Department</ORGANIZATION> export subsidy designed to give grain
companies an incentive to provide food for the hungry people of the
world.
   ``Those are the two items I'm working on now,'' says <PERSON>Melcher</PERSON>, who
pauses to reflect for a moment, then adds, ``I'm open to others.''

<HEAD>Longshot GOP Senate Candidates Profess Optimism</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The politics of optimism is alive at the
<ORGANIZATION>Republican National Convention</ORGANIZATION>.
   But in the case of some <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> candidates for <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> seats held by
veteran Democrats, the odds against them are so long that some
might call it wishful thinking.
   ``I am not a sacrificial goat,'' said <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION> businessman
<PERSON>Joe Malone</PERSON> on <DATE>Monday</DATE> as he detailed his plans to defeat <PERSON>Sen. Edward
M. Kennedy</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-Mass.</LOCATION>, and score the ``upset of the century.''
   Kennedy has represented <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION> in the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> for the <DATE>last
quarter century</DATE> and is considered virtually unbeatable.
   But <PERSON>Malone</PERSON>, who is of Italian descent despite his Irish surname,
was undeterred.
   ``I'm in it to win,'' <PERSON>Malone</PERSON> said at a news conference in which
16 <ORGANIZATION>Republican Senate</ORGANIZATION> candidates were introduced. ``I'm hearing
people saying that 25 years of <PERSON>Ted Kennedy</PERSON> are enough.''
   <PERSON>Jay Wolfe</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION> businessman was equally optimistic.
   His opponent is <PERSON>Sen. Robert C. Byrd</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-W</LOCATION>.Va., the <ORGANIZATION>Senate
Majority</ORGANIZATION> leader.
   Byrd hasn't been defeated since his first victory in <DATE>1958</DATE>, 30
years ago.
   ``If you think I'm in this to lose, just watch on <DATE>Nov. 8</DATE>,''
<PERSON>Wolfe</PERSON> said.
   Republican <PERSON>Alan Keyes</PERSON>, a black former ambassador, was positively
defiant as he roared his optimism that he will unseat <PERSON>Sen. Paul S.
Sarbanes</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-Md.</LOCATION>, an entrenched Democrat in a normally Democratic
state.
   ``Start looking for a surprise,'' <PERSON>Keyes</PERSON> said. ``If any of you
people in the media want to get a head start on looking good in
<DATE>November</DATE>, start writing that <PERSON>Keyes</PERSON> is going to win. We are going to
prove Republicans can split any bloc, take any vote.
   ``That surprise is going to shake our state's one-party system
to its very roots.''
   Rep. <PERSON>Beau Boulter</PERSON>, R-Texas., announced his intention to defeat
<PERSON>Sen. Lloyd Bentsen</PERSON>, D-Texas., who under state law may run for
re-election while he seeks the vice presidency as the running mate
of Gov. <PERSON>Michael Dukakis</PERSON>.
   ``<PERSON>Lloyd Bentsen</PERSON> will fall off both horses he's trying to ride,''
<PERSON>Boulter</PERSON> said.
   <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Conrad Burns</PERSON>, a broadcast executive and a <LOCATION>Yellowstone
County</LOCATION> commissioner, said one reason he is trying to defeat <PERSON>Sen.
John Melcher</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-Mont.</LOCATION>, is that a <ORGANIZATION>Republican Senate</ORGANIZATION> candidate has
not carried <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> for a century.
   ``One Republican every 100 years is only fair,'' he said.
   Hawaii generally votes Democratic, but <PERSON>Maria M. Hustace</PERSON>, a
teacher, social worker and rancher, said she intends to beat the
trend and replace <PERSON>Sen. Spark Matsunaga</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-Hawaii</LOCATION>, a senator since
<DATE>1976</DATE>.
   She called <PERSON>Matsunaga</PERSON> the ``laziest member of the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>,'' said
he is noted primarily ``for taking constituents to lunch'' and said
there is a rumor in the state that he is ill and will retire two
years after winning re-election.
   She immediately added: ``This is not to be a negative campaign.
It will be a positive campaign.''
   <PERSON>Earl Strinden</PERSON>, the executive vice president of the <ORGANIZATION>University of
North Dakota Alumni Association</ORGANIZATION>, is generally credited with having
a relatively good chance to end the 28-year <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> career of <PERSON>Sen.
Quentin Burdick</PERSON>, D-N.D.
   He assured reporters that ``we're not making age an issue.''
   Strinden immediately added: ``But every time a story is written,
it is immediately mentioned that my opponent is 80 years old.''
   At the news conference, <PERSON>Sen. Rudy Boschwitz</PERSON>, <LOCATION>R-Minn.</LOCATION>, chairman
of the <ORGANIZATION>Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee</ORGANIZATION>, said that although
races are too close to call in 12 to 15 of the 32 seats states at
stake in <DATE>November</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> has an excellent chance of recapturing
the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>, now held by the Democrats, 54-46.
   ``We think it is in the realm of reason,'' <PERSON>Boschwitz</PERSON> said.

<HL> Politics &amp; Policy -- Campaign '88: Status Quo Was Big Winner in Tuesday Election With Trend of Divided Government Continuing </HL>

<DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The big winner <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> was the status quo. 

   Vice President <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON> succeeded his mentor, President <PERSON>Ronald Reagan</PERSON>. 
Of 408 incumbents seeking re-election to the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION>, <PERCENT>99%</PERCENT> will be back. 
In the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>, in the face of <PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON>'s triumph over Democrat <PERSON>Michael Dukakis</PERSON>, a single incumbent Democrat was defeated while the Republicans lost three incumbents. 

   At the state level, the Democrats picked up one governorship -- they now outnumber the Republicans 28 to 22 -- and hung on to almost all of their legislative seats, even in the Deep South, where <PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON> crushed <PERSON>Mr. Dukakis</PERSON>. 

   It's the same old story. 
Republicans win the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> -- this was their fifth victory in the past six elections -- and Democrats hold on to the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>, most of the governorships and most of the state legislatures. 
Divided government is becoming an American institution. 

   One reason for <PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON>'s decisive victory -- he piled up almost <PERCENT>54%</PERCENT> of the popular vote and won 426 out of 538 electoral votes -- was a growing sense of optimism about the nation's economy, according to a Wall Street Journal/NBC News national voter poll. 
In the election-day poll, <PERCENT>28%</PERCENT> of the respondents said they expected the economy to improve next year (and <PERCENT>16%</PERCENT> thought it would get worse). 
This was a big jump from recent Journal/NBC News telephone polls, in which only about <PERCENT>19%</PERCENT> felt optimistic about the economy. 

   Men, much more than women, believed in the good news about the economy, and that led to the so-called gender gap. 
<PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON> was supported by more than half of the men surveyed but less than half of the women. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Reagan</PERSON> won his great landslides with an outpouring of votes from young people. 
But <PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON>, despite reaching out to the "baby boomers" with his selection of 41-year-old <PERSON>Dan Quayle</PERSON> as his running mate, barely broke even with voters from 25 to 42 years old. 
<PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON> had a slight edge in the Journal/NBC poll. 
But among even younger voters -- those between 18 and 24 -- <PERSON>Mr. Dukakis</PERSON> held a narrow edge. 

   There was more encouraging news for the Democrats. 
According to the Journal/NBC poll, six out of 10 Democrats who voted for <PERSON>Mr. Reagan</PERSON> four years ago came home to vote for <PERSON>Mr. Dukakis</PERSON>. 
Nine out of 10 blacks stuck with the Democratic ticket (though it wasn't clear how high the black turnout was). 
Among Roman Catholics, <PERSON>Mr. Dukakis</PERSON> maintained a narrow lead, reversing the <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> advantage in recent elections. 
Among Jewish voters, he led better than two to one, while <PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON> led among Protestants. 

   By carrying 10 states and the <ORGANIZATION>District of Columbia</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Dukakis</PERSON> did better than <PERSON>Walter Mondale</PERSON> in <DATE>1984</DATE> (one state and the <ORGANIZATION>District of Columbia</ORGANIZATION>) and President <PERSON>Jimmy Carter</PERSON> in <DATE>1980</DATE> (six states and the always reliable <ORGANIZATION>District of Columbia</ORGANIZATION>). 

   Frustrating to the Democrats is how tantalizingly close they came in 11 other states, where they picked up <PERCENT>46%</PERCENT> or more of the vote. 
These states include <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION>. 
If <PERSON>Mr. Dukakis</PERSON> had won all 11 of these states, he would have eked out a narrow electoral-college victory. 

   In the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>, where turnovers occur much more frequently than in the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> and where the Republicans had control from <DATE>1980 to 1986</DATE>, the Democrats actually gained one or two seats. 

   The big shocker was <LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION>, where three-term incumbent <PERSON>Lowell Weicker</PERSON> was upset by Democrat <PERSON>Joe Lieberman</PERSON>. 
Two other <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> incumbents -- Chic <PERSON>Hecht</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION> and <PERSON>David Karnes</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION> -- were defeated by, respectively, Gov. <PERSON>Richard Bryan</PERSON> and former Gov. <PERSON>Robert Kerrey</PERSON>. 

   In another upset, Democrat <PERSON>John Melcher</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> was defeated by former farm broadcaster <PERSON>Conrad Burns</PERSON>. 
Closest of all is the <ORGANIZATION>Florida Senate</ORGANIZATION> race between Democratic Rep. <PERSON>Buddy MacKay</PERSON> and Republican Rep. <PERSON>Connie Mack</PERSON>, which may be decided by the absentee ballots that are still to be counted. 

   Republican hopes that <PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON> might have coattails never were realized in <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> races. 
In a swing district in <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION>, for example, Democrats retained the seat held by the late Rep. <PERSON>James Howard</PERSON>. 
And in <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION>'s 11th district, the most competitive in the nation, Democratic Rep. <PERSON>James McClure Clarke</PERSON> beat Republican <PERSON>Charles Taylor</PERSON> to become the first incumbent to be returned from that district since <DATE>1978</DATE>. 

   Democrats did well in contests for open <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> seats. 
They held onto a district in <LOCATION>southeast Florida</LOCATION> as Democrat <PERSON>Harry Johnston</PERSON> easily defeated Republican <PERSON>Ken Adams</PERSON> after a hard-fought campaign. 
Democrats also won <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> seats being given up by Republicans in <LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>. 

   Most of the incumbents turned out on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> were mired in scandal, notably <ORGANIZATION>House Banking Committee Chairman Fernand St Germain</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Rhode Island</LOCATION> Democrat who had been investigated for allegedly accepting favors from a savings-and-loan lobbyist. 

   Georgia Republican Rep. <PERSON>Patrick Swindall</PERSON>, under indictment for his participation in a federal drug-money sting, was easily defeated by Democrat <PERSON>Ben Jones</PERSON>, who played the character "Cooter" in the television series "The Dukes of Hazzard." 

   Other <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> members touched by scandal were locked in tight races. 
Democrats <PERSON>Roy Dyson</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Maryland</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Bill Chappell</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, both implicated in the <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> procurement scandal, held razor-thin leads in races that could be decided by absentee ballots. 
Similarly, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> Republican <PERSON>Joseph DioGuardi</PERSON>, under fire for accepting <MONEY>$50,000</MONEY> in allegedly illegal campaign contributions, was trailing his Democratic opponent in a close contest that could also turn on absentee voters. 

   The most important of these races was the defeat of Rep. <PERSON>St Germain</PERSON>, a 14-term veteran and the first <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> committee chairman to be turned out since <DATE>1980</DATE>. 
Next in line for his job is the eccentric Rep. <PERSON>Henry Gonzalez</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, who has had little legislative impact in his 26-year <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> career. 
While he doesn't seem to get much respect among rank-and-file Democrats, he is likely to have the backing of <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON>James Wright</PERSON>, a fellow Texan. 
In addition, <PERSON>Mr. Gonzalez</PERSON>'s colleagues may find it difficult to reject one of the few senior Hispanic members of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>. 

   Rep. <PERSON>Frank Annunzio</PERSON>, a rough-hewn <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> machine pol who is the third-ranking committee member, is in frail health and isn't likely to seek the chairmanship. 
Others down the seniority line eyeing the post include <LOCATION>Del</LOCATION>. 
<PERSON>Walter Fauntroy</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>District of Columbia</ORGANIZATION> and Reps. 
<PERSON>Stephen Neal</PERSON> of <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Mary Rose Oakar</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> and <PERSON>John LaFalce</PERSON> and <PERSON>Charles Schumer</PERSON>, both of <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. 

   In the 12 governors' races <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, Democrats registered a net gain of one statehouse, increasing their margin over the Republicans to 28 to 22. 

   The big win for the Democrats took place in <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION>, where <PERSON>Evan Bayh</PERSON>, son of former <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> <PERSON>Sen. Birch Bayh</PERSON>, defeated Republican Lt. Gov. <PERSON>John M. Mutz</PERSON>, <PERCENT>53%</PERCENT> to <PERCENT>47%</PERCENT>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Bayh</PERSON> becomes the state's first Democratic governor in 20 years. 
His father was defeated for re-election to the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1980</DATE> by a young Republican, <PERSON>Dan Quayle</PERSON>. 

   In <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION>, veteran Republican Gov. <PERSON>Arch Moore</PERSON> was denied an unprecedented fourth term in office when he was defeated by Democrat <PERSON>Gaston Caperton</PERSON>, an insurance executive. 

   In <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>, the Democratic candidate, former Gov. <PERSON>Thomas Judge</PERSON>, was upset by Republican state <PERSON>Sen. Stan Stephens</PERSON>, ending a long Democratic reign. 

   Democrats held their own in state legislative races too, where they already held a 4,445 to 2,923 lead over the Republicans. 
Maintaining this lead carries an important political advantage, as state legislatures prepare to reapportion congressional seats in <DATE>1991</DATE> following the <DATE>1990</DATE> census. 
Republicans have long contended that one reason the Democrats hang on to the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> is that, decade after decade, they gerrymander the districts to their advantage. 

   Fragmented returns indicated the Republicans failed to make any gains in legislative seats, a turnaround for them in light of Republican gains of more than 300 seats in <DATE>1980</DATE> and again in <DATE>1984</DATE>. 

   Democrats remain in control of both chambers in 28 states and control one of the two chambers in 13 more. 
The Republicans control both chambers in eight states. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Nebraska Legislature</ORGANIZATION> is unicameral and nonpartisan. 

   On <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, the Democrats picked up control of the house in <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> and the senate in <LOCATION>New Mexico</LOCATION> and lost the house in <LOCATION>Vermont</LOCATION>. 
The Democrats lost 13 house seats in <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION>, their biggest setback and possibly an omen of what is in store for them in the South, and lost some ground in <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>.

   <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>'s race for governor, rocked by the
sudden withdrawal of the incumbent and the unexpected death of his
chief opponent, has left the state with a jumble of more candidates
than it has seen in 16 years.
   The remaining candidates in the <DATE>June 7</DATE> primary include <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>'s
attorney general, who is trying to overcome a drunken-driving
conviction; a former governor; a former state <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION>
justice; three past and present legislators; a drug
addict-turned-preacher and a tax protester.
   Democratic Gov. <PERSON>Ted Schwinden</PERSON>'s decision last <DATE>summer</DATE> not to seek
a third term, saying he wanted concentrate more on his farm and
family, opened doors for candidates who had been unwilling to take
on the popular incumbent.
   Then, in early <DATE>April</DATE>, a plane crash killed the Republican
front-runner, Secretary of State <PERSON>Jim Waltermire</PERSON>, leaving his
supporters with a dilemma over which of the two remaining <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION>
contenders to back.
   The common thread running through the eight-man campaign for
governor, the most crowded since <DATE>1972</DATE>, has been economic
development, with the candidates offering ideas for infusing new
life into <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>'s lackluster economy.
   The two Republican candidates, former state <PERSON>Sen. Stan Stephens</PERSON>
and state Rep. <LOCATION>Cal Winslow</LOCATION>, are vying for the chance to end the
<ORGANIZATION>Democratic Party</ORGANIZATION>'s 20-year reign in the governor's chair.
   Both men have legislative backgrounds; <PERSON>Stephens</PERSON> has logged 16
years in the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Winslow</PERSON> has served eight years in <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION>.
But the similarities end there.
   <PERSON>Stephens</PERSON>, 58, has attracted support from the mainstream of the
state <ORGANIZATION>Republican Party</ORGANIZATION>, collecting support from former party
leaders and longtime <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> officeholders. He boasts of his experience
in <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> leadership positions and as a successful businessman from
northern <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>.
   Winslow, 38, has appealed to the younger elements of the
<ORGANIZATION>Republican Party</ORGANIZATION>, portraying himself as a conduit for attracting
new business to the state.
   The six Democratic candidates include three serious contenders.
   <PERSON>Thomas Judge</PERSON>, who was governor from <DATE>1973</DATE> to <DATE>1981</DATE>, is attempting
a comeback after losing in the <DATE>1980</DATE> Democratic primary to
Schwinden. The 53-year-old investment adviser has built his
campaign on experience and an elaborate economic development plan.
   ``I won't need four years of on-the-job training,'' he has said,
boasting of the state's lucrative economy during his two terms as
governor.
   Attorney General <PERSON>Mike Greely</PERSON>, 48, overcame the stigma of a <DATE>1986</DATE>
drunken-driving conviction to enter the race. He's called for a
more aggressive program for marketing <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> products elsewhere.
   <PERSON>Frank Morrison Jr.</PERSON>, who resigned as a state <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION>
justice last year to run, has emerged as the candidate most
vehemently opposed to a retail sales tax.
   Seen as the most liberal of the Democrats, the 50-year-old
<PERSON>Morrison</PERSON> has political roots in <LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION>, where his father was a
three-term governor.
   The other Democratic candidates are <PERSON>Ted Neuman</PERSON>, a little-known
state senator and farmer; <PERSON>Emmett</PERSON> ``Curly'' <PERSON>Thornton</PERSON>, a traveling
evangelist who preaches on the dangers of alcohol and drug abuse
based on his own past addictions; and <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> ``Red'' <PERSON>Beckman</PERSON>, a tax
protester and author.

<TEXT>
   Here is a look at the closest races, starting with <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>
contests:
   <LOCATION>NORTH CAROLINA</LOCATION> - <PERSON>Harvey Gantt</PERSON>, the black former mayor of
<LOCATION>Charlotte</LOCATION>, is giving <PERSON>Sen. Jesse Helms</PERSON> the toughest race of his
career. Independent polls say the race is a dead heat. Gantt and
<PERSON>Helms</PERSON> differ on just about every issue. The conservative Republican
senator depicts his challenger as ``an extremist'' who supports
late-term abortions and those for sex-selection. Gantt depicts
<PERSON>Helms</PERSON> as an ideologue who votes against the interests of his state,
particularly on education and the environment.
   IOWA - Democratic <PERSON>Sen. Tom Harkin</PERSON> is battling Rep. <PERSON>Tom Tauke</PERSON> as
well as an <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION> tradition of not re-electing Democratic senators.
Polls show <PERSON>Harkin</PERSON> consistently in the lead but his edge is often
well within the margin of error. Abortion is a major issue with
<PERSON>Harkin</PERSON> pro-choice and <PERSON>Tauke</PERSON> firmly opposed to abortion. <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION> bucked
a national trend in the <DATE>1980s</DATE> and became one of the strongest
growth areas for the Democrats, a factor that could help <PERSON>Harkin</PERSON> in
a close race.
   <LOCATION>OREGON</LOCATION> - Republican <PERSON>Sen. Mark Hatfield</PERSON>, bidding for a fifth
term, may be the best example of a complacent incumbent. Democratic
businessman <PERSON>Harry Lonsdale</PERSON> hammered away at <LOCATION>Hatfield</LOCATION> for months and
the senator ignored the challenge until a recent poll showed
<PERSON>Lonsdale</PERSON> had climbed to within 6 points of the incumbent. Another
race in which abortion is an issue; <PERSON>Hatfield</PERSON> is opposed while
<PERSON>Lonsdale</PERSON> is a supporter.
   HAWAII - Generally regarded as the best chance for the
Republicans to pick up a Democratic seat. Democrat <PERSON>Daniel Akaka</PERSON> was
appointed to the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> last <DATE>summer</DATE> after Spark <PERSON>Matsunaga</PERSON> died. A
lackluster campaigner who held a safe <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> seat for seven terms,
<PERSON>Akaka</PERSON> is opposed by Republican Rep. <PERSON>Pat Saiki</PERSON>. Even Hawaii
Democrats conceded that <PERSON>Saiki</PERSON> is a dynamic campaigner and has a
strong chance to win in this heavily Democratic state.
   <LOCATION>MASSACHUSETTS</LOCATION> - <PERSON>Sen. John Kerry</PERSON> was considered a shoo-in for
re-election in this heavily Democratic state until the voters
expressed their rage in the <DATE>Sept. 18</DATE> primary. Suddenly, independent
polls said the race between <PERSON>Kerry</PERSON> and his Republican challenger,
<PERSON>Jim Rappaport</PERSON>, was a dead heat. A wealthy businessman prepared to
spend millions on the race, <PERSON>Rappaport</PERSON> is concentrating on linking
<PERSON>Kerry</PERSON> to the highly unpopular outgoing governor, <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON>.
   RHODE ISLAND - <PERSON>Democrat Claiborne Pell</PERSON> was elected to the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>
in <DATE>1960</DATE>, the year <PERSON>John F. Kennedy</PERSON> was elected president. His six
terms have given him the seniority to become chairman of the
<ORGANIZATION>Foreign Relations Committee</ORGANIZATION> but have also made him vulnerable to a
challenge from 43-year-old Rep. <PERSON>Claudine Schneider</PERSON>. Politely but
firmly, <PERSON>Schneider</PERSON> suggests it is time for a younger person to take
<ORGANIZATION>Pell</ORGANIZATION>'s seat. However, recent polls give <PERSON>Pell</PERSON>, 71, an 18-point lead.
   NEW HAMPSHIRE - GOP Rep. <PERSON>Bob Smith</PERSON> was heavily favored to
capture the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> seat being vacated by fellow conservative <PERSON>Gordon
Humphrey</PERSON>. But former <PERSON>Sen. John Durkin</PERSON> has made a race of it and a
recent poll said <PERSON>Smith</PERSON>'s 4-point lead was within the margin of
error.
   In other states, a large number of <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> contests looked
tempting to challengers but didn't seem to pan out. They include
<LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION> where Democratic <PERSON>Sen. Paul Simon</PERSON> looks far ahead of
Republican Rep. <PERSON>Lynn Martin</PERSON>; <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> where Democratic <PERSON>Sen. Carl
Levin</PERSON> is outdistancing Rep. <PERSON>Bill Schuette</PERSON>; <LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION> where
Democratic <PERSON>Sen. James Exon</PERSON> leads former Rep. <PERSON>Hal Daub</PERSON>; <LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION>
where Republican <PERSON>Sen. Mitch McConnell</PERSON> leads <PERSON>Harvey Sloane</PERSON>, and
<LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> where Democratic <PERSON>Sen. Max Baucus</PERSON> is well ahead of Lt. Gov.
<PERSON>Allen Kolstad</PERSON>.
   Among the races for governor, these are getting the most
attention:
   <LOCATION>CALIFORNIA</LOCATION> - The battle between former <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> Mayor
<PERSON>Dianne Feinstein</PERSON>, the Democratic nominee, and GOP <PERSON>Sen. Pete Wilson</PERSON>
is generally regarded as the most important contest in the nation.
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION> is likely to pick up seven new <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> seats in <DATE>1992</DATE> and
if <PERSON>Feinstein</PERSON> wins her party will have total control of how the
lines are drawn in the nation's most populous state. A victory for
<PERSON>Wilson</PERSON> gives the <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> an important role although the legislature
will remain Democratic. <PERSON>Wilson</PERSON> and <PERSON>Feinstein</PERSON> agree on more issues
than they disagree. <PERSON>Wilson</PERSON>'s lead in the polls is well within the
margin of error.
   <LOCATION>TEXAS</LOCATION> - Republican millionaire <PERSON>Clayton Williams</PERSON> seemed well on
his way to victory over Democrat <PERSON>Ann Richards</PERSON>. But last week a new
poll said <PERSON>Richards</PERSON> had moved to within 5 points of <ORGANIZATION>Williams</ORGANIZATION>, whose
repeated verbal gaffes may be cutting into his support.
   <LOCATION>FLORIDA</LOCATION> - <PERSON>Martinez</PERSON> got into trouble over taxes early in his
first term and then found his hard-line anti-abortion stand had
moved out of favor with voters. Former <PERSON>Sen. Lawton Chiles</PERSON> got into
the race and led in most polls. Recently the margin has narrowed
and <PERSON>Martinez</PERSON> has a big edge in money.
   <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> is one of the six states where <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> governors are
threatened. The others are <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION>, where Gov. Guy Hunt is leading
teachers union official <PERSON>Paul Hubbert</PERSON>; <LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION>, where Gov. <PERSON>Kay Orr</PERSON>
is trailing businessman <PERSON>Ben Nelson</PERSON>; <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION>, where Gov. <PERSON>Mike Hayden</PERSON>
and state treasurer <PERSON>Joan Finney</PERSON> were in a dead heat; <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION>, where
former Democratic Gov. <PERSON>Joseph Brennan</PERSON> held a narrow lead over Gov.
<PERSON>John R. McKernan</PERSON>; and <LOCATION>Rhode Island</LOCATION> where Gov. <PERSON>Edward DiPrete</PERSON> was
running far behind businessman <PERSON>Bruce Sundlun</PERSON>.
   The best bets for Republican pickups were in <LOCATION>Vermont</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Oregon</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>. Democratic governors are not
running in each of those states.
   In <LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION>, GOP Gov. <PERSON>Henry Bellmon</PERSON> is not running and Democrats
hope for another gain.

   <PERSON>Dianne Feinstein</PERSON>, savoring success in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>'s Democratic
primary for governor, embarked on her fall campaign today against
well-financed <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> rival <PERSON>Pete Wilson</PERSON>. <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION> Democrats picked
a black man to try to dethrone GOP <PERSON>Sen. Jesse Helms</PERSON>.
   In the longest count of a nine-state primary election, <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION>
Attorney General <PERSON>Don Siegelman</PERSON> squeezed into a runoff for the
Democratic nomination for governor with teacher lobbyist <PERSON>Paul
Hubbert</PERSON> after an all-night vote tally. The winner of the <DATE>June 26</DATE>
balloting will face GOP Gov. Guy Hunt.
   Seven senators gained nominations for new terms. GOP <PERSON>Sen. Thad
Cochran</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION> was arguably the biggest winner among them.
He faces no Democratic opposition in the <DATE>fall</DATE> and is thus assured of
a new term.
   Democrats <PERSON>Bill Bradley</PERSON> of <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Howell Heflin</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION>
and <PERSON>Max Baucus</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> easily overcame challenges within their
party, while Democrat <PERSON>Tom Harkin</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION> and Republicans <PERSON>Larry
Pressler</PERSON> of <LOCATION>South Dakota</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Pete Domenici</PERSON> of <LOCATION>New Mexico</LOCATION> were
unopposed.
   Incumbent governors in <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>South Dakota</LOCATION> also were
renominated, along with Hunt in <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION>.
   In <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, both <PERSON>Feinstein</PERSON> and <PERSON>Wilson</PERSON>, a second-term senator,
were kicking off their fall campaigns with breakfast appearances.
   ``Whoop it up tonight because this is your last victory party of
the <DATE>1990s</DATE>,'' <PERSON>Wilson</PERSON> told the Democrats late <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> night after
breezing to his nomination.
   Democratic national chairman <PERSON>Ron Brown</PERSON> hailed <PERSON>Feinstein</PERSON>'s success
and called the defeat of two Republican-backed redistricting
referenda a ``blowout for us.''
   ``They are going to have a money advantage,'' he said, referring
to <PERSON>Wilson</PERSON>'s <MONEY>$3 million</MONEY> warchest. But, he added, ``issues are going
to prevail.''
   It was the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> Democratic primary for governor that drew
most of the nationwide attention, both for the size of the state and
because the next governor will play a large role in determining
which party benefits from a census that may increase the state's
congressional delegation by a half-dozen seats.
   ``One mission completed, one to go,'' former <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> Mayor
<PERSON>Feinstein</PERSON> told supporters after securing her victory in a
hard-fought primary.
   With <PERCENT>99 percent</PERCENT> of the precincts counted, she had <PERCENT>52 percent</PERCENT> of
the vote, to <PERCENT>41 percent</PERCENT> for Attorney General <ORGANIZATION>John Van de Kamp</ORGANIZATION>. Nine
other candidates split the remaining votes.
   Wilson breezed to an easy primary victory on the <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> side, and
said he'd keep the governor's office in Republican hands. He decided
to run for the job when GOP Gov. <PERSON>George Deukmejian</PERSON> declined to seek
a third term.
   Feinstein praised Van de Kamp in her victory speech and said the
fall campaign will be a choice between two Californias. ``One ...
with a declining quality of life, more crime, more traffic ... It is
content with caretaker government,'' she said. ``But our <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>
is a ... bold place.''
   In <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Helms</PERSON> congratulated <PERSON>Harvey Gantt</PERSON> on ``a
hard-earned victory.''
   ``How sweet it is,'' a jubilant <PERSON>Gantt</PERSON> told supporters after
dispatching prosecutor <PERSON>Mike Easley</PERSON> with <PERCENT>57 percent</PERCENT> of the vote. His
victory made him the first of his race to win a <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> nomination
this century in <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION>.
   ``I want to tell you that God is good, yes he is. It's a new day
in <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON>Gantt</PERSON>, a former mayor of <LOCATION>Charlotte</LOCATION>.
   Alabama boasted the closest race of the night, a Democratic
primary to pick an opponent for incumbent GOP Gov. Guy Hunt.
   <ORGANIZATION>Education Association</ORGANIZATION> lobbyist <PERSON>Hubbert</PERSON> and <PERSON>Siegelman</PERSON> claimed the
right to face off in the runoff. With <PERCENT>96 percent</PERCENT> of precincts
reporting, <PERSON>Hubbert</PERSON> was winning <PERCENT>32 percent</PERCENT> of the vote and Siegelman
<PERCENT>25 percent</PERCENT>, followed by former Gov. <PERSON>Fob James</PERSON> with <PERCENT>22 percent</PERCENT> and
Rep. <PERSON>Ronnie Flippo</PERSON> 17 percent. Two other candidates trailed.
   ``This is no place for the faint-hearted,'' said <PERSON>Flippo</PERSON> as the
long count continued.
   In an <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION> primary contest viewed as a referendum on abortion,
<ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON>Don Avenson</PERSON> claimed the Democratic nomination for
governor against <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> incumbent <PERSON>Terry Branstad</PERSON>, who opposes abortion.
Avenson, who favors abortion rights, won <PERCENT>40 percent</PERCENT> of the vote to
defeat anti-abortion Democrat <PERSON>Tom Miller</PERSON> and three other contenders.
The <ORGANIZATION>National Organization for Women</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>National Abortion Rights
ActionLeague</ORGANIZATION>, both of which endorsed <PERSON>Avenson</PERSON>, had feared he would
split the vote with other pro-choice contenders and permit <PERSON>Miller</PERSON> to
win.
   In addition to picking candidates for governor, Californians
voted to raise the state gasoline tax from 9 to <MONEY>18 cents</MONEY> a gallon to
finance badly needed highway repair. Supporters said approval of the
measure would mark a symbolic end to the tax revolt that began in
<DATE>1978</DATE> with passage of Proposition 13. With <PERCENT>98 percent</PERCENT> of precincts
counted, the proposal was gaining <PERCENT>52 percent</PERCENT> of the vote.
   The lines were drawn for what shape up as some of the nation's
most contested <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> elections in <DATE>November</DATE>, when Republicans seek
to cut into the current 55-45 Democratic advantage.
   Republicans count <PERSON>Harkin</PERSON> as among the most vulnerable Democrats,
and Rep. <PERSON>Tom Tauke</PERSON> has been campaigning against him even in advance
of formally claiming the <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> nomination <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>.
   Republicans profess hope for knocking off two-term Democrat <PERSON>Max
Baucus</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>, as well. The victor in a four-way <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> race was
Lt. Gov. <PERSON>Allen Kolstad</PERSON>, who entered the race at the urging of the
national Republican leadership.
   In <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Christine Todd Whitman</PERSON> was unopposed for the <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION>
nomination to oppose <PERSON>Bradley</PERSON>. In <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION>, state <PERSON>Sen. Bill Cabannis</PERSON>
had no <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> opposition for the chance to challenge <PERSON>Heflin</PERSON>.
   GOP <PERSON>Sen. Domenici</PERSON> in <LOCATION>New Mexico</LOCATION> will face Democratic State <PERSON>Sen.
Tom Benavides</PERSON>, who was unopposed for his party's nomination.
   On the other side of the aisle, Democrats eye <PERSON>Pressler</PERSON> of <LOCATION>South
Dakota</LOCATION> as a potential victim for the <DATE>fall</DATE>. Ted <LOCATION>Muenster</LOCATION>, who had no
primary opposition, will run against him.
   In <LOCATION>New Mexico</LOCATION>'s governor's race, former Gov. <PERSON>Bruce King</PERSON> won the
Democratic nomination in a bid to regain the office he's held for
eight years _ longer than anyone in state history. Former state Rep.
<PERSON>Frank Bond</PERSON> won the Republican nomination. Each man defeated three
rivals.

<HEAD>In Arcane World of the Senate, Seniority is Sometimes Debatable</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There will be 11 new senators in the 101st
<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> that convenes <DATE>Jan. 3</DATE>, but they soon will find they aren't
all created equal.
   Republicans, who suffered a one-seat loss in this month's
elections and were left at a 55-45 disadvantage, can take slight
consolation as the pecking order of the new freshman class falls
into place when the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> meets to elect its leadership next week.
   Atop the new seniority list is Republican <PERSON>Slade Gorton</PERSON>, who won
his comeback bid in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> state. He takes that spot as the only
former senator in the incoming class.
   The top status will be at least a minimal boost for <ORGANIZATION>Gorton</ORGANIZATION>. It
entitles him to first pick of vacant office suites in the three
<ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> office buildings and perhaps a few other perks, like a
coveted ``hideaway'' office in the <LOCATION>Capitol</LOCATION>.
   In the <ORGANIZATION>Senate Republican Conference</ORGANIZATION>, the party conclave that
makes committee assignments for <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> members, <ORGANIZATION>Gorton</ORGANIZATION>'s prior service
also will give him a leg up on his freshman colleagues in the class
of <DATE>'89</DATE>.
   Last on the seniority list will be <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> Republican <PERSON>Conrad
Burns</PERSON>, the former farm broadcaster and <ORGANIZATION>Yellowstone County
Commissioner</ORGANIZATION> who ousted incumbent Democrat <PERSON>John Melcher</PERSON>.
   If <PERSON>Burns</PERSON> wants to know what to expect, he should ask <LOCATION>North Dakota</LOCATION>
Democrat <PERSON>Kent Conrad</PERSON>, who came in dead last in the seniority
sweepstakes two years ago and wound up with an office off a dank
stairwell in the farthest corner of the <ORGANIZATION>Hart Senate Office Building</ORGANIZATION>.
   Republicans also hold the next three positions on the seniority
list. All are lawmakers who are moving from the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> to the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>:
<PERSON>Trent Lott</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Jim Jeffords</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Vermont</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Connie Mack
of Florida</ORGANIZATION>.
   Lott ranks first among the three because he is a 16-year <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION>
veteran who rose to the party's No. 2 leadership position in the
chamber. <PERSON>Jeffords</PERSON>, after 14 years in the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION>, ranks next; and
<PERSON>Mack</PERSON>, a six-year <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> member, will be next in line of seniority.
   In the arcane scheme of things senatorial, politicians who have
been governors get less credit than <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> members. Being governor
isn't legislative experience, after all, and <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> tends to favor
its own.
   ``Things are different over there,'' <PERSON>Lott</PERSON> said recently, grinning
and shaking his head after trying to master the details of the
<ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> seniority system.
   Three incoming freshman senators have been governors, all
Democrats: <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Charles Robb</PERSON>, <PERSON>Robert Kerrey</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION> and
<PERSON>Richard Bryan</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION>, who will be ranked in that order. Among
freshmen with the same qualifications, ties are broken by the
population of the state from which a senator is elected.
   Bringing up the rear of the seniority list are three new senators
who have no experience that earns credit in the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> ranking
scheme. Again, they are ranked by the sizes of their states:
millionaire businessman <PERSON>Herb Kohl</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Wisconsin</LOCATION> Democrat; <PERSON>Joseph
Lieberman</PERSON>, the <LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION> attorney general who defeated incumbent
<PERSON>Lowell Weicker</PERSON>; and <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Burns</PERSON>.
   This neat arrangement could all be fouled up, however, by the
eleventh new member of the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>: the person appointed to replace
<PERSON>Sen. Dan Quayle</PERSON>, <LOCATION>R-Ind.</LOCATION>, who is leaving the chamber to be vice
president.
   Quayle has announced plans to resign sometime before the new
<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> convenes on <DATE>Jan. 3</DATE>, to enable GOP <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON>Robert Orr</PERSON>
to select a Republican. Otherwise, a new Democratic governor will
take over in <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION> and appoint a Democrat.
   Where that person will rank on the seniority list is a topic of
debate, and may have to be resolved by a vote in the Republican
conference. He or she could rank first, by virtue of being sworn in
earlier than the others; or it could be last, because <PERSON>Quayle</PERSON> doesn't
technically become unable to hold his <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> seat until <DATE>Jan. 20</DATE>,
<ORGANIZATION>Inauguration Day</ORGANIZATION>.
   In earlier times, an outgoing senator could give his successor a
seniority boost by resigning a few days early and letting the
replacement come into office ahead of others in the new group. But
the practice threatened to mushroom out of control, and has been
abandoned by both the <ORGANIZATION>GOP Conference</ORGANIZATION> and the Democratic Caucus, the
other party assembly that makes committee assignments.
   If it all seems rather complicated, take heart. Even <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>
insiders disagree on how the whole thing works. Said one Democratic
leadership official: ``It's worse than the family tree, folks.''

<HEAD>Democrats Gun for Bigger Senate Advantage</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There is an unusual unanimity this year about
prospects for the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>'s balloting: Democrats will
remain in control, and may well increase their eight-seat advantage.
   ``The Democrats will hold onto 54 seats at a minimum, and I
believe have a very good opportunity to add,'' said <PERSON>Sen. John Kerry</PERSON>
of <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>Democratic Senatorial Campaign
Committee</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``We realize it's still quite volatile out there,'' said <PERSON>Tom
Mason</PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION>National Republican Senatorial Committee</ORGANIZATION>.
``We could end up on Election Day minus two. But we could just as
easily be plus two or better.''
   One reason little change is expected is that, unlike some past
presidential elections, there has been no overriding national theme
dictated by the top of the ticket, the kind of compelling issue that
would propel voters to seek massive changes.
   Rather, polls have show a general contentment with the status
quo, and that works to the benefit of incumbents.
   That advantage extends to the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION>, where very little movement
is expected in the Democrats' 255-177 majority.
   ``There isn't the thematic difference'' that has pervaded
presidential contests in the past, <PERSON>Mason</PERSON> said. ``President <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>
said it best: We are the change. It's not as clear a mandate as in
<DATE>1980</DATE>, when there was such a screaming need for change.''
   That was the year Republicans rode <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>'s coattails to a
12-seat pickup and control of the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> for the first time in a
quarter-century. In <DATE>1986</DATE>, an eight-seat gain enabled Democrats to
retake control.
   This time, Republican <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON> and Democrat <PERSON>Michael Dukakis</PERSON>
have been criticized for running a race devoid of issues, devoted
mostly to personal attacks and distortions of each other's records.
   So issues in this year's <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> campaign have been largely drawn
from a list of topics that Democrats claim as their own, although
they have been used by candidates of both parties: the environment,
education, Social Security, health care and ``family issues'' like
child care.
   Also prominent in <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> stump speeches and advertising have been
the problems of drugs and crime, which register near the top of
Americans' concerns in national polls.
   Most <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> incumbents of both parties appeared likely to win
re-election on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, but there were several prominent exceptions.
   Analysts said Republican <PERSON>Sen. David Karnes</PERSON>, who was appointed in
<DATE>1987</DATE> to fill an unexpired <ORGANIZATION>Nebraska Senate</ORGANIZATION> term, was the most likely
to be ousted. Democratic former Gov. <PERSON>Bob Kerrey</PERSON>, a popular figure
with a Hollywood-like appeal in the state, held a heavy lead in
polls.
   Three other incumbents _ two Republicans and one Democrat _ also
faced difficult battles for survival.
   In <LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION>, GOP <PERSON>Sen. Chic Hecht</PERSON>, who for months had been
considered the most vulnerable Republican incumbent, has fought back
to a dead heat with his challenger, Democratic Gov. <PERSON>Richard Bryan</PERSON>. A
political action committee of import car dealers was pouring
<MONEY>$382,000</MONEY> into mass mailings and TV spots for <PERSON>Hecht</PERSON>, and <PERSON>Hecht</PERSON> was
running ads linking himself to <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> and <PERSON>Bryan</PERSON> to <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON>.
   <PERSON>Sen. Lowell Weicker</PERSON>, the veteran maverick Republican from
<LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION>, has resorted to his own negative ads attacking
challenger <PERSON>Joseph Lieberman</PERSON>, the state's Democratic attorney
general. The race is the most complex political matchup in the
country. Lieberman has sought to outflank Weicker by portraying him
as aloof from <LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION> concerns, and has attracted support from
all parts of the political spectrum.
   Republicans hungry for an upset were pointing to <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>, where
they claimed to have Democratic incumbent <PERSON>John Melcher</PERSON> on the run.
His GOP rival, <ORGANIZATION>Yellowstone County Commissioner Conrad Burns</ORGANIZATION>, was
running positive biographical ads in the closing days of the
campaign, while <PERSON>Melcher</PERSON> was airing man-in-the-street testimonials
advising against sending ``a greenhorn'' to <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>.
   Six open seats, where no incumbent was seeking re-election, were
the other major battleground. Democratic former <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> Gov.
<PERSON>Charles Robb</PERSON> appeared poised to claim a formerly Republican seat,
and Rep. <PERSON>James Jeffords</PERSON>, <LOCATION>R-Vt.</LOCATION>, was likely to enter the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> from
his state. Rep. <PERSON>Trent Lott</PERSON>, <LOCATION>R-Miss.</LOCATION>, also seemed to be holding
firmly to a polling lead in his bid to replace retiring Democratic
<PERSON>Sen. John Stennis</PERSON>.
   But in three other open seats, the outcome was up for grabs.
   Former <PERSON>Sen. Slade Gorton</PERSON>, a Republican, picked up a spate of
last-minute newspaper endorsements in his bid to keep <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>'s
<ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> seat in <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> hands, but polls showed Democratic rival Rep.
<PERSON>Mike Lowry</PERSON> in a dead heat.
   <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> promised a similar cliffhanger, with Democratic Rep.
<PERSON>Buddy MacKay</PERSON> seeking to beat out Republican Rep. <PERSON>Connie Mack</PERSON> in a
state where <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> held a heavy advantage. Like <PERSON>Hecht</PERSON>, <PERSON>Mack</PERSON> was
receiving substantial last-minute backing from the import car
dealers PAC.
   In <LOCATION>Wisconsin</LOCATION>, Democrat <PERSON>Herb Kohl</PERSON>, a millionaire who owns the
<LOCATION>Milwaukee</LOCATION> Bucks basketball team, was holding onto a narrowing lead
in his effort to retain the seat of retiring <PERSON>Sen. William Proxmire</PERSON>
for the Democrats. Republican state <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> minority leader <PERSON>Susan
Engeleiter</PERSON> was pressing hard, and both <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> and <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> campaigned
for her in the state.

<TEXT>
   Democrats were favored to retake the governor's office in <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION>
and <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION> and were locked in tighter-than-ever races with
<ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> incumbents in <LOCATION>Rhode Island</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION> today as voters in 12 states
cast ballots for their top job.
   <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> also held the possibility that the governor's office
might change party hands, with the candidates in a dead heat to
succeed Democrat <PERSON>Ted Schwinden</PERSON>.
   Utah Gov. <PERSON>Norm Bangerter</PERSON>, overcoming the stigma of a record <MONEY>$166
million</MONEY> tax increase in <DATE>1987</DATE>, erased an early, 30-point deficit in
the polls to draw even with Democrat <PERSON>Ted Wilson</PERSON>. In <LOCATION>Rhode Island</LOCATION>,
<PERSON>Bruce Sundlun</PERSON>'s allegations of unethical conduct lifted him into a
too-close-to-call race against Gov. <PERSON>Edward DiPrete</PERSON>.
   Democrats hold 27 of the 50 governorships. Nine incumbents _ six
Republicans and three Democrats _ are on the ballot. Republican
<PERSON>Robert Orr</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION> is barred by law from a third term; Schwinden
and <LOCATION>New Hampshire</LOCATION> Republican <PERSON>John Sununu</PERSON> are retiring.
   If Massachussetts' <PERSON>Michael Dukakis</PERSON> is elected president, Lt. Gov.
<PERSON>Evelyn Murphy</PERSON>, also a Democrat, will serve out his gubernatorial
term. In <LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION>, Lt. Gov. <PERSON>Bob Miller</PERSON> will succeed fellow Democrat
<PERSON>Dick Bryan if Bryan</PERSON> is elected to the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>.
   Other states electing governors are <LOCATION>Delaware</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>North
Dakota</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Vermont</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Evan Bayh</PERSON>, son of former <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> <PERSON>Sen. Birch E. Bayh</PERSON>, was favored to
become <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION>'s first Democratic governor office in 20 years,
although his lead appeared to be slipping. The 32-year-old <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION>
secretary of state would also be the youngest <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> governor in
office.
   An <LOCATION>Indianapolis</LOCATION> Star poll published <DATE>Oct. 30</DATE> gave him a 54-40 lead
over Republican Lt. Gov. <PERSON>John M. Mutz</PERSON>. But a statewide poll by the
<ORGANIZATION>Public Opinion Laboratory</ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION>Indiana University-Purdue University</ORGANIZATION> at
<LOCATION>Indianapolis</LOCATION> and released <DATE>Monday</DATE> showed likely voters splitting <PERCENT>50.1
percent</PERCENT> for <PERSON>Bayh</PERSON> to 46.3 for <PERSON>Mutz</PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> hoped a big Bush-Quayle
victory in <PERSON>Sen. Dan Quayle</PERSON>'s home state would help pull <PERSON>Mutz</PERSON>
through. It was <PERSON>Quayle</PERSON> who ousted the elder <PERSON>Bayh</PERSON> from the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> in
<DATE>1980</DATE>.
   In <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION>, Republican <PERSON>Arch Moore</PERSON>, seeking an unprecedented
fourth term, fought for his political life. His opponent, <PERSON>Democrat
Gaston Caperton</PERSON>, an insurance executive and political novice, has
called the election a referendum on the economy in <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION>,
which has one of the nation's highest unemployment rates and had to
borrow <MONEY>$80 million</MONEY> from its investments this year to pay its bills
because of a slump in coal and other industries.
   A poll <DATE>Oct. 31</DATE> and <DATE>Nov. 1</DATE> gave <PERSON>Caperton</PERSON> a 51-35 lead, unchanged
from mid-October, but <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> is a 65-year-old political warhorse who
has made a career overcoming the odds in predominantly Democratic
<LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION>.
   ``People know <PERSON>Arch Moore</PERSON> hasn't delivered and that I will
deliver,'' <PERSON>Caperton</PERSON> said.
   In <LOCATION>Rhode Island</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Sundlun</PERSON>, a communications executive who lost to
<ORGANIZATION>DiPrete</ORGANIZATION> by a landslide in <DATE>1986</DATE>, robbed the governor of an early,
commanding lead by raising questions about <PERSON>DiPrete</PERSON>'s private
business deals, alleged favoritism in the awarding of state
contracts and the hiring of the ex-wife of a reputed mobster for a
state job. DiPrete has stressed the state's economic recovery.
   Two TV station polls <DATE>last week</DATE> had the candidates one point apart.
   The <PERSON>Bangerter</PERSON> campaign in <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION> also counted on a strong showing
by Vice President <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON>. The governor's comeback largely
coincided with <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s surge since the <ORGANIZATION>Republican National Convention</ORGANIZATION>
in <DATE>August</DATE>. The outcome may also hinge on whether independent <ORGANIZATION>Merrill
Cook</ORGANIZATION>, who ran on a tax-limitation platform, can hold the support of
conservatives.
   Two polls issued <DATE>Sunday</DATE> had <PERSON>Wilson</PERSON>, the former mayor of Salt <LOCATION>Lake
City</LOCATION>, 2 points ahead of <PERSON>Bangerter</PERSON> with <PERCENT>37 percent</PERCENT>, and even with the
governor at <PERCENT>36 percent</PERCENT>. Cook had <PERCENT>26 percent</PERCENT> and <PERCENT>24 percent</PERCENT>.
   ``It's always scary to see those polls drop, but <DATE>15 months ago</DATE>,
when we led by 30, we knew there was no way we could win by more
than 4 points,'' said <PERSON>Wilson</PERSON> campaign manager <PERSON>Rob Jolley</PERSON>.
   <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Thomas Judge</PERSON>, Democratic governor from <DATE>1973</DATE> to <DATE>1981</DATE>,
and Republican state <PERSON>Sen. Stan Stephens</PERSON> claimed late momentum in a
campaign over how to revive the state's economy. A poll late last
month indicated a dead heat.
   Neither side expected much of a coattail effect from the <ORGANIZATION>White
House</ORGANIZATION> race; ticket-splitting <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> has sided with the <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION>
presidential winner for 20 years, but its governor, both senators
and one of two congressmen are Democrats.
   In other races:
   <LOCATION>DELAWARE</LOCATION> _ Republican Gov. <PERSON>Michael N. Castle</PERSON> was expected to roll
toward an overwhelming victory against Democrat <PERSON>Jacob Kreshtool</PERSON>, a
retired attorney and political newcomer.
   MISSOURI _ Republican Gov. <PERSON>John Ashcroft</PERSON> headed for an expected
landslide against Democratic state Rep. <PERSON>Betty Hearnes</PERSON>, wife of a
former governor.
   NEW HAMPSHIRE _ Republican <PERSON>Judd Gregg</PERSON>, a congressman and son of a
former governor, was favored over <PERSON>Paul McEachern</PERSON>, a fierce opponent
of the <PERSON>Seabrook</PERSON> nuclear plant who nearly rode the issue into the
<LOCATION>Statehouse</LOCATION> <DATE>two years ago</DATE>.
   NORTH <LOCATION>CAROLINA</LOCATION> _ Republican Gov. <PERSON>Jim Martin</PERSON> led Lt. Gov. <PERSON>Bob
Jordan</PERSON>, a Democrat.
   NORTH <LOCATION>DAKOTA</LOCATION> _ Gov. <PERSON>George Sinner</PERSON> held a commanding lead in the
polls over Republican <PERSON>Leon Mallberg</PERSON>, a businessman making his first
run for statewide office.
   VERMONT _ Democrat <PERSON>Madeleine Kunin</PERSON>, the state's first woman
governor, was favored for a third term against <ORGANIZATION>House GOP</ORGANIZATION> Leader
<PERSON>Michael Bernhardt</PERSON>.
   <LOCATION>WASHINGTON</LOCATION> _ Democratic Gov. <PERSON>Booth Gardner</PERSON> headed for an expected

<TEXT>
   Two governors began work today, an incumbent in <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION> and a
Republican in <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> who was the first GOP candidate to win that
state's highest office in 20 years.
   In Salt <LOCATION>Lake City</LOCATION>, Republican Gov. <PERSON>Norm Bangerter</PERSON>, who barely
survived a three-way gubernatorial election in <DATE>November</DATE>, began his
second term as the state's 13th governor. <PERSON>Val Oveson</PERSON>, the incumbent
lieutenant governor also was sworn in during <DATE>Monday</DATE>'s ceremony.
   <PERSON>Stan Stephens</PERSON>, a former <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> state senator who moved to the
state from <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> 40 years ago to harvest wheat, took his oath in
<LOCATION>Helena</LOCATION> after <PERSON>Allen Kolstad</PERSON>, a farmer-businessman from <PERSON>Chester</PERSON> and
also a former state senator, was sworn in as lieutenant governor.
   <PERSON>Bangerter</PERSON>, who trailed Democrat <PERSON>Ted Wilson</PERSON> by more than <PERCENT>30
percentage points</PERCENT> in the polls this past <DATE>summer</DATE>, rallied to claim a
<PERCENT>40-38 percent</PERCENT> victory over <LOCATION>Wilson</LOCATION>. Independent <ORGANIZATION>Merrill Cook</ORGANIZATION> had <PERCENT>22
percent</PERCENT>.
   <PERSON>Bangerter</PERSON>, 55, said he followed the advice of the late British
Prime Minister Winston Churchill: ``Never give in, never give in,
never, never give in, except to convictions of honor or good sense.''
   <PERSON>Bangerter</PERSON> was sworn in before a crowd of 1,400 at the <LOCATION>Capitol
Rotunda</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Stephens</PERSON>, 59, told the inaugural audience at the Capitol in
<LOCATION>Helena</LOCATION> that he assumes the job of chief executive with a ``deep
sense of responsibility'' knowing of the troubles that beset <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>.
   ``The <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> economy has been depressed,'' <PERSON>Stephens</PERSON> said. ``We
have endured the ravages of drought and forest fires and of being
perceived negatively on the barometric scales of business and
commerce.
   ``<LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>'s spirit has been bruised, but never broken,'' he said.
   <PERSON>Stephens</PERSON>, who portrayed himself as a harbinger of change during
his two-year campaign, pledged that change will be for the better.

<HEAD>Senate Republicans on the Offensive in 1990 Elections</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The numbers say this election year should be a
good one for Democrats to strengthen their hold on the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>. But
since candidates and not numbers win elections, it's the GOP that's
on the offensive.
   ``We have a better crop of challengers this time than we've ever
had,'' said <PERSON>Sen. Don Nickles</PERSON>, <LOCATION>R-Okla.</LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>National
Republican Senatorial Committee</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``I'd be happy and pleased and I think we would say we've done a
good job if we stay the same'' in Democratic strength, said <PERSON>Sen.
John Breaux</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-La.</LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>Democratic Senatorial Campaign
Committee</ORGANIZATION>.
   By tradition, an off-year election bodes well for the party that
doesn't control the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION>. And from a distance, it looks like
this one should follow the pattern.
   Democrats have a 55-45 majority in the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>, but the
Republicans have more seats at risk. Of the 34 <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> seats on the
line, the <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> must defend 18 and the Democrats 16.
   Three incumbent Republicans are retiring, heightening the
apparent Democratic opportunity.
   But seven months before the election, it appears the Democrats
have failed to recruit many top-flight candidates while the <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> has
succeeded. That gives Republicans hope they can narrow the
Democrats' majority this year and perhaps reclaim control of the
<ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1992</DATE>.
   In all three cases where Republican senators are stepping down
this year, <ORGANIZATION>GOP House</ORGANIZATION> members have stepped forward as candidates and
are the early front-runners.
   In <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION>, where <PERSON>Sen. Bill Armstrong</PERSON> is retiring, Rep. <PERSON>Hank
Brown</PERSON> hopes to step into the breach. Popular Rep. <PERSON>Robert Smith</PERSON> is
running for the seat being vacated by <PERSON>Sen. Gordon Humphrey</PERSON> in <LOCATION>New
Hampshire</LOCATION>. And in <LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION>, Rep. <PERSON>Larry Craig</PERSON> is seeking to succeed
<PERSON>Sen. James A. McClure</PERSON>.
   Four other <ORGANIZATION>House Republicans</ORGANIZATION> are taking the far riskier leap
into races against incumbent Democrats _ creating potentially the
hottest <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> contests in the nation.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Iowa Senate</ORGANIZATION> campaign already is steaming as Republican Rep.
<PERSON>Tom Tauke</PERSON> challenges incumbent Democrat <PERSON>Tom Harkin</PERSON>. In <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>,
GOP Rep. <PERSON>Lynn Martin</PERSON> has had help from President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> in her
challenge against Democratic <PERSON>Sen. Paul Simon</PERSON>.
   In <LOCATION>Rhode Island</LOCATION>, Republican Rep. <PERSON>Claudine Schneider</PERSON> is trying to
unseat a popular but aging Democratic <PERSON>Sen. Claiborne Pell</PERSON>. And in
<LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>, Republican Rep. <PERSON>Bill Schuette</PERSON> is in a primary fight
against conservative activist <PERSON>Clark Durant</PERSON> for the right to
challenge Democratic <PERSON>Sen. Carl Levin</PERSON>.
   Another close race is shaping up in <LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION>, where former
Republican Rep. <PERSON>Hal Daub</PERSON>, who failed in a <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> bid two years ago,
is challenging Democratic incumbent <PERSON>Sen. J. James Exon</PERSON>. Another
Democratic incumbent that Republicans consider vulnerable is <PERSON>Sen.
Max Baucus</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>. The list of Republican challengers there
includes Lt. Gov. <PERSON>Allen Kolstad</PERSON>.
   Meanwhile, no Republican senators who are seeking re-election
appear to be in serious trouble so far. Poll results suggest that
<ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> Sens. <PERSON>Jesse Helms</PERSON> in <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Mitch McConnell</PERSON> in
<LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION> are vulnerable, but potential Democratic challengers still
are fighting among themselves in both states.
   Although some <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> Democrats flirted with entering <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>
races, none did. And in several cases, popular present and former
state office holders passed up seemingly good opportunities to move
to <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>.
   The Democrats tried hard to recruit candidates ``but their
efforts just seemed to come up a little bit short,'' said political
analyst <PERSON>Charles Cook</PERSON>. Finding a good <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> candidate is mostly
luck of the draw and ``this time, the Republicans got all the
breaks,'' he said.
   The result is apparent security for the <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> _ even a slim chance
of taking control of the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> if they can sweep all of the close
races _ while ``Democrats have too many seats close to the edge,''
<PERSON>Cook</PERSON> said.
   A 50-50 split would give Republicans control, because the
Republican vice president would break tie votes.
   If the Republicans trimmed the Democratic majority to less than
two or three seats after this election, the <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> would be in a good
position to retake the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1992</DATE> when 20 Democrats and only 14
Republicans face re-election.
   There is talk of two more races being added to the 34 scheduled
this <DATE>fall</DATE>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Hawaii Democrat Spark Matsunaga</ORGANIZATION> has cancer and must be brought
into the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> chamber by wheelchair to vote. Although he has not
indicated he will resign, potential successors have been quietly
eyeing his seat.
   A <ORGANIZATION>Senate Ethics Committee</ORGANIZATION> investigation of <PERSON>Sen. Dave
Durenberger</PERSON>'s personal finances has led to speculation that the
<LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION> Republican might resign if serious charges were brought.
   <PERSON>Breaux</PERSON>, who leads the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> Democrats' campaign committee, said
his lack of <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> challengers from the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> isn't the handicap
the <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> cognoscenti make it out to be.
   ``Who's to say that <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> members are better candidates than
people who are not from <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> and can run against the mistakes
and the problems that <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> is in fact responsible for?'' he
asked.
   Breaux acknowledged, though, that he's hoping for some upsets.
One race where he sees potential is Democratic businessman <PERSON>Ted
Muenster</PERSON>'s bid to oust Republican <PERSON>Sen. Larry Pressler</PERSON> in <LOCATION>South
Dakota</LOCATION>.
   The Democratic drive to hold the line this year is fueled by the
specter of <DATE>1992</DATE>.
   ``I'm running down the track looking over my left shoulder and
then I turn and look over my right shoulder,'' said <PERSON>Breaux</PERSON>, who
faces re-election himself in two years.
   Neither <PERSON>Breaux</PERSON> nor <PERSON>Nickles</PERSON> saw an overriding national theme in
this year's races.
   <PERSON>Breaux</PERSON> said the abortion issue could help Democrats in several
pro-choice states where the Republican candidate has an
anti-abortion stance, as is the case in <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>. It also
could give Democrats an upset, perhaps in <LOCATION>New Hampshire</LOCATION> or <LOCATION>Oregon</LOCATION>,
where anti-abortion incumbent <PERSON>Mark O. Hatfield</PERSON> is being challenged
by Democratic businessman <PERSON>Harry Lansdale</PERSON>.
   Nickles discounts abortion's role in the next election.
Republican gubernatorial losses in <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> <DATE>last
fall</DATE> may have been due to anti-abortion stands because
``Republicans did a poor job responding,'' and that won't happen
this time, he said.

<HEAD>GOP Still Sees Potential for Senate Gains in November Elections</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican hopes of slashing the Democrats'
55-45 <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> majority hinge on the potential for a voter earthquake
to shake things up in the final weeks before <DATE>Election Day</DATE>.
   Republicans so far have been unable to turn the electorate
against a swath of Democratic incumbents whom the <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> identified
earlier this year as potentially vulnerable.
   All but one Democratic incumbent is leading in the polls. But
Democrats concede the Republican claim that voters have been
distracted by the crisis in the <LOCATION>Persian Gulf</LOCATION> and are just starting
to focus on the races.
   ``Six weeks out, and voters are only now paying attention,''
said <PERSON>Anita Dunn</PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION>Democratic Senatorial Campaign
Committee</ORGANIZATION>. ``I don't think any lead right now is very meaningful.''
   Sen. <PERSON>Don Nickles</PERSON>, <LOCATION>R-Okla.</LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>National Republican
Senatorial Committee</ORGANIZATION>, recalled that in <DATE>1980</DATE> and <DATE>1986</DATE>, the last two
years where the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> changed parties, ``the races really didn't
close until the last three weeks.''
   The <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> is ``certainly within striking distance'' in many races
this year, even if the polls don't always show it, he said. The
list includes <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>
and <LOCATION>Rhode Island</LOCATION>.
   If Republicans get most of the breaks, which <PERSON>Nickles</PERSON> says is
unlikely, they could pick up the five seats needed to wrest control
from the Democrats.
   But the <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> clearly would be satisfied with gaining just two or
three seats, which would make the Democrats especially vulnerable
in <DATE>1992</DATE>, when many who barely won office in <DATE>1986</DATE> are up for
re-election for the first time.
   Currently, <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION> <PERSON>Sen. Daniel Akaka</PERSON> is the only incumbent
Democrat who is behind in the polls, and not by much. Akaka was
appointed to the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> earlier this year to fill the seat of the
late Spark <PERSON>Matsunaga</PERSON>.
   Akaka is running against his former <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> colleague, Republican
Rep. <PERSON>Pat Saiki</PERSON>.
   <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION> has been a brawl for months between Democratic <PERSON>Sen. Tom
Harkin</PERSON> and Republican Rep. <PERSON>Tom Tauke</PERSON>. Republicans say <PERSON>Tauke</PERSON> is
whittling away at <PERSON>Harkin</PERSON>'s lead, but Democrats say <PERSON>Tauke</PERSON> was hurt
by the disclosure that he accepted a congressional pay raise he had
campaigned against. <PERSON>Tauke</PERSON> said he took the money, but later donated
it to charity.
   The <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION>'s heavy recruitment of candidates from the <ORGANIZATION>House of
Representatives</ORGANIZATION> hasn't worked so well in other cases.
   <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Rhode Island</LOCATION> are states where the
Democratic incumbents have held tenaciously to leads in polls
despite tough opposition from <ORGANIZATION>GOP House</ORGANIZATION> members.
   In <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>, incumbent Democrat <PERSON>Carl Levin</PERSON> was preferred by
voters 2-1 over Rep. <PERSON>Bill Schuette</PERSON> in a recent poll, despite an
aggressive television campaign by the Republican challenger.
   President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> interceded to get <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON>Lynn Martin</PERSON> the
<ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> nomination to challenge <PERSON>Sen. Paul Simon</PERSON>, but the Democrat has
maintained a solid lead in the polls.
   <LOCATION>Rhode Island</LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON>Claudine Schneider</PERSON> has proven statewide appeal
in that tiny state. But she's still struggling to chip away at the
popularity of incumbent Democratic <PERSON>Sen. Claiborne Pell</PERSON>.
   Earlier this year, Republicans considered <PERSON>Sen. Max Baucus</PERSON>,
<LOCATION>D-Mont.</LOCATION>, as the most vulnerable of their targets. But <PERSON>Baucus</PERSON> has
climbed in the polls in recent weeks to a solid 25-point lead over
conservative Lt. Gov. <PERSON>Allen Kolstad</PERSON>.
   While disappointed that more hasn't happened in those races, the
<ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> sees new opportunity in <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION>, where voters in the
primary threw out the Democratic Party slate for state officers.
   Sen. <PERSON>John Kerry</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-Mass.</LOCATION>, has been indirectly hurt. Previously
considered safe, <PERSON>Kerry</PERSON> suddenly is just barely ahead of challenger
<PERSON>Rappaport</PERSON> in the polls. Rappaport already has run a television ad
linking <PERSON>Kerry</PERSON> with unpopular Gov. <PERSON>Michael Dukakis</PERSON>.
   But Republicans may have trouble using the ``throw the rascals
out'' tactic in many of the states where they have been most
hopeful, since they recruited so many sitting or former members of
<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> as candidates.
   Democrats are confident <PERSON>Kerry</PERSON> will hold his seat, just as
Republicans are confident <PERSON>Jesse Helms</PERSON> of <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION> will win,
even though he's in a dead heat in the polls with former <LOCATION>Charlotte</LOCATION>
mayor <PERSON>Harvey Gantt</PERSON>.
   Both sides point to longshot chances against the others'
incumbents in other states, and Democrats are behind but still hope
to grab one or more of the three seats where Republican incumbents
are retiring in <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New Hampshire</LOCATION>.
   But perhaps the most unusual race of the year is one where both
parties concede the outcome - that <PERSON>Sen. J. Bennett Johnston</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-La.</LOCATION>,
will win re-election.
   The big question is whether <PERSON>Johnston</PERSON> can capture <PERCENT>50 percent</PERCENT> of
the vote in <LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION>'s <DATE>Oct. 6</DATE> open primary and avoid a runoff in
<DATE>November</DATE> with the sure second-place finisher - former <PERSON>Ku Klux
Klansman David Duke</PERSON>.
   Republicans are so worried that <ORGANIZATION>Duke</ORGANIZATION> will represent their party
on the ticket that they have virtually abandoned the campaign of
their chosen candidate, <PERSON>Ben Bagert</PERSON>, in hopes <PERSON>Johnston</PERSON> can avoid a
runoff.

<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> as candidates.
   Democrats are confident <PERSON>Kerry</PERSON> will hold his seat, just as
Republicans are confident <PERSON>Jesse Helms</PERSON> of <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION> will win,
even though he's in a dead heat in the polls with former <LOCATION>Charlotte</LOCATION>
mayor <PERSON>Harvey Gantt</PERSON>.
   Both sides point to longshot chances against the others'
incumbents in other states, and Democrats are behind but still hope
to grab one or more of the three seats where Republican incumbents
are retiring in <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New Hampshire</LOCATION>.
   But perhaps the most unusual race of the year is one where both
parties concede the outcome - that <PERSON>Sen. J. Bennett Johnston</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-La.</LOCATION>,
will win re-election.
   The big question is whether <PERSON>Johnston</PERSON> can capture <PERCENT>50 percent</PERCENT> of
the vote in <LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION>'s <DATE>Oct. 6</DATE> open primary and avoid a runoff in
<DATE>November</DATE> with the sure second-place finisher - former <PERSON>Ku Klux
Klansman David Duke</PERSON>.
   Republicans are so worried that <ORGANIZATION>Duke</ORGANIZATION> will represent their party
on the ticket that they have virtually abandoned the campaign of
their chosen candidate, <PERSON>Ben Bagert</PERSON>, in hopes <PERSON>Johnston</PERSON> can avoid a
runoff.

   Rival Democrats <PERSON>Harvey Gantt</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mike
Easley</PERSON>, entering the closing hours of their <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> runoff primary,
are concentrating their fire on Republican <PERSON>Sen. Jesse Helms</PERSON>. But
across the continent, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> Democrats are slamming each other.
   <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> are among nine states holding
primaries on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, the busiest day so far of the <DATE>1990</DATE> election
year. The other states are <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New
Jersey</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New Mexico</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>South Dakota</LOCATION>.
   As they entered the final 24 hours before voters cast their
ballots, candidates checked opinion polls, unleashed their final
television ads and tried to stir support with a closing round of
personal appearances.
   Two new polls of potential voter sentiment in the bitterly fought
race for the Democratic nomination for governor of <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> showed
former <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON>Dianne Feinstein</PERSON> maintaining a lead over
state Attorney General <PERSON>John Van de Kamp</PERSON>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Los Angeles Times</ORGANIZATION> poll said <PERSON>Feinstein</PERSON> had a 13-point lead _ a
gain of two points over a similar survey early in <DATE>May</DATE>. The poll gave
the former mayor <PERCENT>42 percent</PERCENT> and <ORGANIZATION>Van de Kamp</ORGANIZATION> <PERCENT>29 percent</PERCENT>. There were
<PERCENT>29 percent</PERCENT> still undecided or supporting one of the nine minor
candidates on the Democratic primary ballot.
   <ORGANIZATION>Mervin Field</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> Poll, which gave <PERSON>Feinstein</PERSON> a slim <PERCENT>3
percent</PERCENT> lead earlier this month, reported that margin had opened up
to 8 points over <LOCATION>Van de Kamp</LOCATION>, 42-34, in polling that concluded
<DATE>Sunday</DATE>. New polls also were out in <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New Mexico</LOCATION>.
   In <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Easley</PERSON> accused <PERSON>Helms</PERSON> of attacking him with
``personal character assassinations'' in radio ads. ``They are
personal and very negative,'' the <LOCATION>Brunswick County</LOCATION> prosecutor told
supporters <DATE>Sunday</DATE>.
   One <PERSON>Helms</PERSON> ad accuses <PERSON>Easley</PERSON> of waffling on the issues and another
suggests that he plea-bargained a drug case involving a campaign
contributor's son who was caught with nearly a pound of cocaine.
   <PERSON>Easley</PERSON> said he was countering with ads saying, ``This year <LOCATION>North
Carolina</LOCATION> must say no to <PERSON>Jesse Helms</PERSON> and mudslinging.''
   ``I think <LOCATION>Charlotte</LOCATION> people believed long before anyone else that
we are going to bring <PERSON>Jesse Helms</PERSON> home,'' <PERSON>Gantt</PERSON> told supporters
<DATE>Sunday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> in <LOCATION>Charlotte</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.C.</LOCATION>
   Abortion was the issue of the day in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> where <PERSON>Sen. Pete
Wilson</PERSON> had only token opposition for the <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> nomination to succeed
fellow Republican <PERSON>George Deukmejian</PERSON> in the governor's office.
Deukmejian declined to seek a third term.
   Van de Kamp appeared on the steps of the <LOCATION>Los Angeles County
Courthouse</LOCATION> with <PERSON>Norma McCorvey</PERSON>, the ``<PERSON>Jane Roe</PERSON>'' of the landmark
<ORGANIZATION>U.S. Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Roe vs. Wade</PERSON> abortion rights decision.
   ``I have no criticism of <PERSON>Mrs. Feinstein</PERSON>'s record (on abortion),''
<PERSON>McCorvey</PERSON> said. ``But I believe <PERSON>John Van de Kamp</PERSON> is the candidate who
will do the most to protect a woman's right to choose. I trust <PERSON>John
Van de Kamp</PERSON>.''
   <PERSON>Feinstein</PERSON> also stressed her long support of abortion rights,
telling fund-raisers in <LOCATION>West Hollywood</LOCATION> that ``I believe that a woman
is best protected by another woman who believes in the right to
choose.''
   The two candidates were running television commercials harshly
attacking each other.
   Van de Kamp's commercials described <PERSON>Feinstein</PERSON> as a ``Republican
in Democratic clothing,'' while the former mayor's ads accused the
attorney general of refusing to ``talk about his own record.''
   Abortion also has been a major issue in <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>'s Democratic primary
for governor. The <ORGANIZATION>National Abortion Rights Action League</ORGANIZATION> endorsed
<ORGANIZATION>Iowa House</ORGANIZATION> speaker <PERSON>Don Avenson</PERSON> in a move designed to help him
against anti-abortion rival <PERSON>Tom Miller</PERSON>, the state attorney general.
Republican Gov. <PERSON>Terry Branstad</PERSON> is an abortion opponent.
   A new poll, published <DATE>Sunday</DATE> in the <LOCATION>Des Moines Register</LOCATION>, said
<PERSON>Avenson</PERSON> had moved into the lead with support from <PERCENT>32 percent</PERCENT> of
those surveyed, compared with <PERCENT>25 percent</PERCENT> for <PERSON>Miller</PERSON>. Former banker
<PERSON>John Chrystal</PERSON> was at <PERCENT>19 percent</PERCENT>, and <PERCENT>20 percent</PERCENT> said they were
undecided.
   The newspaper said the sampling was among 629 likely primary
voters and had a margin of error of <PERCENT>3.9 percent</PERCENT>.
   ``It's breaking our way, obviously,'' said <PERSON>Avenson</PERSON>.
   In <LOCATION>New Mexico</LOCATION>, large fields were seeking the gubernatorial
nomination in both parties. Incumbent GOP Gov. <PERSON>Garrey Carruthers</PERSON> was
ineligible to seek re-election, but the person elected to succeed
him will be the first <LOCATION>New Mexico</LOCATION> governor allowed to serve two
successive terms.
   A new poll published <DATE>Sunday</DATE> in the <LOCATION>Albuquerque</LOCATION> Journal said state
<ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader Les <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION> and former legislator Frank Bond
each had the support of <PERCENT>29.2 percent</PERCENT> of the registered Republicans
surveyed.
   On the Democratic side, former Gov. <PERSON>Bruce King</PERSON> had the backing of
<PERCENT>42.7 percent</PERCENT>, while state Attorney General <PERSON>Paul Bardacke</PERSON> was
supported by <PERCENT>31.5 percent</PERCENT>.
   The poll was conducted for the Journal by <ORGANIZATION>Research and Polling
Inc.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Albuquerque</LOCATION>, which surveyed 664 registered Democrats and 402
registered Republicans. It had a margin of error of plus or minus <PERCENT>4
percent</PERCENT> for the Democrats and <PERCENT>5 percent</PERCENT> for the Republicans.
   A large field was battling in <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION> for the Democratic
nomination to oppose GOP Gov. Guy Hunt, the first Republican to hold
that office since the post-Civil War Reconstruction period.
   Among the Democratic contenders was former Gov. Fob James who was
taped recently by a public television crew while telling a
Republican Party official that ``there ain't but one damn <PERSON>Goldwater</PERSON>
Republican in this race, and you know who that is.''
   An aide to <PERSON>James</PERSON>, a former Republican, said the remark was ``a
joke more than anything.''
   In <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>, four Republicans were vying for the nomination to
oppose Democratic <PERSON>Sen. Max Baucus</PERSON>.
   In <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION>, Republican <PERSON>Sen. Thad Cochran</PERSON> was as good as
re-elected to a third term. He had no primary opposition and no
Democrat has filed to run against him in the <DATE>fall</DATE>.
   Democratic Sens. <PERSON>Bill Bradley</PERSON> of <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Howell Heflin</PERSON> of
<LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION> had only token primary opposition. The same was true of
Republican Sens. <PERSON>Larry Pressler</PERSON> of <LOCATION>South Dakota</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Pete Domenici</PERSON> of
<LOCATION>New Mexico</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Gantt</PERSON> and <PERSON>Easley</PERSON> worked hard to get out their core supporters.
   ``There are a lot of voters out there, especially in the <LOCATION>East</LOCATION>,
that we ought to be able to pick up,'' <PERSON>Easley</PERSON> said while campaigning
in the eastern part of the state. ``If we have a big turnout in the
<LOCATION>East</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Mike Easley</PERSON> will win the runoff. If we don't it'll be real
close.''
   Gantt sought votes in the same region over the weekend,
especially in the northeast, which has a high percentage of black
voters who were critical in the <DATE>May 8</DATE> primary when the former mayor
of <LOCATION>Charlotte</LOCATION> led a six-man field.
   But <PERSON>Gantt</PERSON> fell short of the <PERCENT>40 percent</PERCENT> threshold he needed to
avoid a runoff and become the first black candidate for statewide
office in <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION> this century.

<DESCRIPT>  MONTANA; ENVIRONMENT  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  After a lifetime on the wind-scraped eastern front of the Continental Divide,
Ed and Eileen Grady finally have given in to the miseries of Montana cattle
ranching: endless winters, drought, depressed beef prices and, more recently,
an invasion of city slickers.;   Hanging a for-sale sign on their 10,000-acre
ranch was the hardest thing Eileen Grady says she has ever done. But what
makes her particularly angry is the thought of what might become of the old
Grady place, a timbered and grassy piece of high country that seems to roll up
to the edge of the big sky.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Front  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  MONTANA LANDS BEING CARVED UP
'RANCHETTES' REPLACE WORKING RANCHES  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     "We've got to give the place up to pay for taxes, and I feel like the
vultures are circling," she said. "I look around and see these ranchettes on
what used to be working ranches, and it just disgusts me.";   A new
phenomenon;   She is referring to a new real-estate phenomenon in <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>:
big, open ranches going under the knife of subdivision and being marketed to
urbanites in distant cities.;   Carved into lots as small as 20 acres, they
are sold as ranchettes -- often too small to graze a single head of cattle but
big enough to meet someone's cowboy fantasy.;   Nobody is sure exactly how
much ranch land has been carved into small lots. However, a recent study by
the <ORGANIZATION>Greater Yellowstone Coalition</ORGANIZATION>, a Montana-based environmental group, found
that in the area around <LOCATION>Yellowstone Park</LOCATION> more than 1 million acres of private
land has been sliced into recreational or residential subdivisions.;  
Although other Western states are seeing ranchettes where there used to be
nothing but cattle or sheep, no state has quite the expanse of property, the
low price or the celebrity cachet -- this year, at least -- of Montana.;   The
advertisement for the Grady ranch is typical. "Live the dream," proclaims the
advertisement in <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> magazine.;   Certainly, ranch life in this cold
region northwest of <LOCATION>Helena</LOCATION>, the state capital, has been more work than dream
for the <ORGANIZATION>Gradys</ORGANIZATION>. But all around them, the dream is unfolding, or so it seems,
to celebrities who want very little to do with cattle ranching.;   Celebrity
buyers;   Among the celebrity buyers are broadcasting tycoon <PERSON>Ted Turner</PERSON>;
actors <PERSON>Dennis Quaid</PERSON>, <PERSON>Glenn Close</PERSON>, <PERSON>Michael Keaton</PERSON> and <PERSON>Brooke Shields</PERSON>. Their
purchases, real estate agents say, have helped spur sales of ranchettes to
other people.;   A 20-acre piece of <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> can be had for as little as
<MONEY>$7,500</MONEY>. But with every acre that goes out of cattle production, traditional
ranchers say, they lose influence in the state government. And as the value of
neighboring property goes up, so do their taxes and so does the pressure to
sell.;   Environmentalists say that for every acre that is burdened with a new
road and fresh-built fence, the elk, deer and antelope herds of the <LOCATION>Rocky
Mountains</LOCATION> lose more precious winter pasture.;   Thus, the real estate agents
who sell ranchettes have managed to do what no politician has yet been able to
do: bring ranchers and environmentalists together.;   "These ranchettes pose a
major threat for the future of <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>," said <PERSON>Bill Long</PERSON>, a director of the
<ORGANIZATION>Montana Land Reliance</ORGANIZATION>, a non-profit group that buys development rights from
ranchers to keep land from being subdivided.;   Thus far, the <ORGANIZATION>Land Reliance</ORGANIZATION>
has purchased rights to 80,000 acres, putting money into the ranchers' pockets
while assuring that the land will not be bought by someone wanting to turn it
into ranchettes.;   Ranchers 'very concerned';   "We're seeing more and more
subdivisions, and it's got us very concerned," said <PERSON>Kim Enkerud</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Montana
Stockgrowers' Association</ORGANIZATION>. "One day, the ranchers won't be around, and you'll
end up with something far worse than what you've got now.";   <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>, with
its open land ethic, has no statewide zoning laws affecting property of 20
acres or more and few regulations on what a property owner can do with that
land. A proposal to allow state government review of 20-acre subdivisions
failed by two votes in the state Legislature this year.;   Rep. <PERSON>Bob Gilbert</PERSON>, a
Republican who introduced the bill, said he will introduce it again next
year.;   "We're selling off <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>, piece by piece, to out-of-staters,"
<PERSON>Gilbert</PERSON> said. "These people are changing our state before our very eyes. You
can't hunt and fish on a lot of these ranchettes. Pretty soon, you won't
recognize this state."  </TEXT>

   Democratic Vice presidential candidate <PERSON>Lloyd Bentsen</PERSON> was flying
back to <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> from <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>. He won a new term in the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>, and
as chairman of the tax-writing <ORGANIZATION>Senate Finance Committee</ORGANIZATION>, will spend
the next two years negotiating with the Republican administration on
issues such as taxes and trade.
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> and the new <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> began warming up to each other,
although no one was underestimating the differences after a long and
bruising campaign.
   ``The question is whether there will be a honeymoon. ...
Certainly there will be considerable confict between their agenda
and our agenda,'' said <PERSON>Sen. Rudy Boschwitz</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION>, who
spearheaded the losing Republican campaign to win control of the
<ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``Look, there's no hard feelings,'' said the president-elect.
   ``Most of us have know <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON> for a long time,'' replied
<PERSON>Sen. Joseph Biden</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Delaware</LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>Judiciary Committee</ORGANIZATION>.
He said he spoke for all Democratic chairmen in saying he was
``prepared to work with President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> and do that straight up, no
holds barred and find whether he means what he says when he says
that he expects to have a close relationship with the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> and the
<ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION>.''
   Whatever else happened, the senators knew that <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> carried most
of their states. He won 40 of them _ and nine of the 11 largest _
inluding <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>.
   Dukakis carried <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION> and eight other states as
well as the <ORGANIZATION>District of Columbia</ORGANIZATION>.
   The race to pick a new <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> power broker was under way in
earnest. Senate Majority Leader <PERSON>Robert Byrd</PERSON> was giving up his
leadership post in the new <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON>J. Bennett Johnston</PERSON> of
<LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION>, <PERSON>George Mitchell</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Daniel Inouye</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION> were
in a race to succeed him.
   That figured to be a campaign as tough as any waged this year,
and with a tiny number of registered voters _ the ranks of
Democratic senators in the new <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>.
   Speaker <PERSON>Jim Wright</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> was re-elected without opposition and
will lead the Democrats in the new <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION>.
   All in all it was an election that treated incumbents kindly, yet
one that produced its fair share of fresh faces.
   The new senators included <PERSON>Joseph Lieberman</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION>, a
Democrat who ended <PERSON>Lowell Weicker</PERSON>'s maverick career after three
terms. Former Govs. <PERSON>Charles Robb</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Robert Kerrey</PERSON> in
<LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION> turned <ORGANIZATION>Republican Senate</ORGANIZATION> seats into Democratic ones. Gov.
<PERSON>Richard Bryan</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION> ousted freshman GOP <PERSON>Sen. Chic Hecht</PERSON> in
<LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Herbert Kohl</PERSON> was elected <LOCATION>Wisconsin</LOCATION>'s new Democratic senator.
   <PERSON>Conrad Burns</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> was the only Republican to defeat a
<ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> Democratic incumbent. He beat <PERSON>John Melcher</PERSON>, seeking a third
term.
   Other newly elected Republicans in the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> included Rep. <PERSON>Trent
Lott</PERSON> from <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION> and Rep. <PERSON>James Jeffords</PERSON> from <LOCATION>Vermont</LOCATION>, both of
whom won open seats. <PERSON>Slade Gorton</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, defeated in a
re-election bid two years ago, mounted a successful comeback.
   One Republican, <PERSON>Sen. Malcolm Wallop</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION>, squeaked to a new
term.
   Though a few <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> incumbents remained locked in tough races on
the afternoon after the election, that didn't change the overall
picture. Incumbency was practically a guarantee of victory.
   The few exceptions to the rule included Rep. <PERSON>Fernand J. St
Germain</PERSON>, a 14-term veteran and chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>House Banking
Committee</ORGANIZATION>. Beset by charges of ethical lapses, he fell to political
newcomer <PERSON>Ronald Machtley</PERSON>.
   Three Republican incumbents were turned out of office, including
<PERSON>Pat Swindall</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION>, who was defeated by <PERSON>Ben Jones</PERSON>. Swindall
faces perjury charges.
   Other <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> incumbents who fell included freshman <PERSON>Jack Davis</PERSON> in
<LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Mac Sweeney</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>.
   Democrats picked up statehouse offices formerly held by
Republicans, including <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION> where 32-year-old <PERSON>Evan Bayh</PERSON> wrested
control from the Republicans for the first time in 20 years. <PERSON>Gaston
Caperton</PERSON> ousted GOP Gov. <PERSON>Arch Moore</PERSON> in <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION>.
   Republicans countered with one takeaway of their own when <PERSON>Stan
Stephens</PERSON> won the <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> statehouse for the <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> for the first time
in 16 years.
   Two Republican incumbents survived close calls.
   Gov. <PERSON>Edward DiPrete</PERSON> overcame allegations of unethical conduct in
<LOCATION>Rhode Island</LOCATION> to defeat a Democratic businessman for the second time
in two years, while fellow Republican <PERSON>Norm Bangerter</PERSON> was re-elected
in <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION>.
   Republican Rep. <PERSON>Judd Gregg</PERSON> stepped up to the <LOCATION>New Hampshire</LOCATION>
governor's office.

   Former two-term Gov. <PERSON>Thomas Judge</PERSON> beat five
Democratic rivals to win his party's nomination for governor, and
Democratic <PERSON>Sen. John Melcher</PERSON>'s bid for a third term is opposed by
<PERSON>Gordon Burns</PERSON>, a Republican county commissioner.
   ``People remember we had eight good years,'' <PERSON>Judge</PERSON> said after
<DATE>Tuesday</DATE>'s victory. ``While they remember the past, they also wanted
to know our plans for the future. ... We put forth a program that
the people of this state have been waiting for.''
   In the presidential primary contest, <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON>Michael
Dukakis</PERSON> easily beat <PERSON>Jesse Jackson</PERSON> for 19 Democratic delegates while
Vice President <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON> walked away in the Republican contest.
   Judge will face Republican <PERSON>Stan Stephens</PERSON> in <DATE>November</DATE> in his run
for the office he held eight years until his ouster by his own
lieutenant governor in the <DATE>1980</DATE> Democratic primary. Two-term Gov.
<PERSON>Ted Schwinden</PERSON> is retiring.
   Melcher quashed a token challenge from Billings lawyer <PERSON>Robert
Kelleher</PERSON>; <PERSON>Burns</PERSON>, a county commissioner from Billings, beat <PERSON>Thomas
Faranda</PERSON>, a Minnesotan who quit an absentee race though his name
stayed on the <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> ballot.
   <PERSON>Stephens</PERSON>, a former state senator from Havre who edged Rep. <PERSON>Cal
Winslow</PERSON> for the <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> nomination, says memories also may hurt Judge.
He said the former governor ``represents an administration from
yesteryear.''
   With 977 of 982 precincts reporting, or <PERCENT>99 percent</PERCENT>, <PERSON>Judge</PERSON> had
46,274 votes, or <PERCENT>39 percent</PERCENT>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Former Supreme Court Justice Frank Morrison Jr.</ORGANIZATION> had 31,868 votes
or <PERCENT>27 percent</PERCENT>, and Attorney General <PERSON>Mike Greely</PERSON> had 26,742 votes or
<PERCENT>23 percent</PERCENT>.
   State <PERSON>Sen. Ted Neuman</PERSON> got <PERCENT>6 percent</PERCENT> of the vote; <ORGANIZATION>Martin</ORGANIZATION> ``Red''
<PERSON>Beckman</PERSON>, a tax protester, got <PERCENT>3 percent</PERCENT> and <PERSON>Emmett</PERSON> ``Curly''
<PERSON>Thornton</PERSON>, an ex-drug addict turned evangelist, took <PERCENT>2 percent</PERCENT>.
   In the Republican gubernatorial race, with <PERCENT>99 percent</PERCENT> of
precincts reporting, <PERSON>Stephens</PERSON> had 43,684 votes or <PERCENT>50 percent</PERCENT> to
<LOCATION>Winslow</LOCATION>'s 37,585 votes or <PERCENT>43 percent</PERCENT>.
   In the <ORGANIZATION>Democratic Senate</ORGANIZATION> primary, with 977 of 982 precincts

compared with 29,766 votes or <PERCENT>25 percent</PERCENT> for <PERSON>Kelleher</PERSON>.
   On the Republican side, <PERSON>Burns</PERSON>, a county commissioner from
Billings, defeated <PERSON>Thomas Faranda</PERSON>, a Minnesotan who filed for the
<ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> nomination but gave up his absentee quest in <DATE>April</DATE>, tough his
name remained on the ballot.
   With <PERCENT>99 percent</PERCENT> of precincts reporting, <PERSON>Burns</PERSON> had 63,007 votes
or <PERCENT>85 percent</PERCENT>, compared with 11,419 votes, or <PERCENT>15 percent</PERCENT>, for
Faranda.
   <PERSON>Melcher</PERSON> said the difference between him and <PERSON>Burns</PERSON> is experience.
   ``I think it's pretty obvious I've been here awhile,'' <PERSON>Melcher</PERSON>
said in a telephone interview from his suburban <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION>,

   President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> lashed out today at the

for the skyrocketing deficit and ``government by gridlock in

at a <MONEY>$100-a-plate</MONEY> fund-raising breakfast for <ORGANIZATION>GOP Senate</ORGANIZATION> candidate
<PERSON>Allen Kolstad</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>'s lieutenant governor, who is trying to
unseat incumbent Democratic <PERSON>Sen. Max Baucus</PERSON>.
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> reiterated his promise to negotiate a budget agreement
``without preconditions'' and said ``we are getting some good
cooperation with the leadership on the Democratic side of the
aisle'' in those talks.
   He devoted most of the speech to a strident attack on the
opposition, who control the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> by a 55-45 margin and the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION>
by 257-176. <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> is hoping to wrest back control of the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> for
the <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> in this <DATE>fall</DATE>'s 34 <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> races.
   ``With the Democrats now in the control of the <ORGANIZATION>United States
Congress</ORGANIZATION>, both houses, we're facing government by gridlock in
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, with spending skyrocketing out of control, good
legislation thrown aside for pork barrel programs and a budget
deficit looming over our children's children,'' <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> said.
   ``While the <ORGANIZATION>Republican Party</ORGANIZATION> is using everything we've got to
build a strong, competitive <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>, the Democratic stranglehold on
the <LOCATION>United States Congress</LOCATION> has finally taken its toll,'' he said.
   ``Enough is enough. We must end this 'deficits don't matter'
mentality,'' <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> said. ``I do not want to preside over these
godawful deficits that are saddling these young people here with
billions in debt.''
   He attacked <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> for not passing his educational excellence
act and his version of child care legislation, and blasted it for
adding <MONEY>$3.5 billion</MONEY> to his request for <MONEY>$800 million</MONEY> in emergency
aid for <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Nicaragua</LOCATION> last <DATE>spring</DATE>.
   It took 108 days to win passage of the bill, <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> said, a delay
that ``jeopardized the hard-won freedom of the brave people of
<LOCATION>Nicaragua</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>. That's more than a difference between
parties. In my view that was a disgrace.''
   Later, at an anti-drug rally in <LOCATION>Daylis Stadium</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> criticized
<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> for not passing his anti-crime package.
   Standing in front of a huge banner with a map of <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> and the
legend, ``Don't Let Drugs Cloud The Big Sky,'' <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> declared,
``It's time for <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> to act. Our children, our communities and
our cops have waited long enough.''
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> was flying later to <LOCATION>Cheyenne</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wyo.</LOCATION>, to attend a Frontier
Days parade and rally, inspect the nation's only squadron of 50 MX
missiles in their silos at <ORGANIZATION>Warren Air Force Base</ORGANIZATION> and get in a quick
fishing trip to the <ORGANIZATION>Middle Crow Creek Fishing Area</ORGANIZATION> before heading
back to <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>.
   Asked why <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> was going out of his way to inspect the newest
nuclear missile in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> arsenal at a time of reduced East-West
tensions, spokesman <PERSON>Marlin Fitzwater</PERSON> said the president wanted to
underscore ``the need to maintain a strong defense during changing
times.''
   Soviet missiles are still ``aimed at us. Our relations are
changing, but both countries have millions of men under arms,''
<PERSON>Fitzwater</PERSON> said aboard <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> One. ``We can't let down our
guard.''
   At a <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> fund-raising dinner in <LOCATION>Boise</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION>, on <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>
defended his reversal on tax increases and blamed <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> for the
looming <MONEY>$160 billion</MONEY> deficit.
   Addressing 900 people at an event that raised upwards of
<MONEY>$200,000</MONEY> for Rep. <PERSON>Larry Craig</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> race, the president said
<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> ``appropriates every dollar and tells the president how to
spend every single penny.''
   ``I have said I will negotiate without preconditions. And I
will,'' he said.
   ``You've seen the firestorm about revenues being on the table,''
aid <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>, who sowed discord in Republican ranks last month by
abandoning his ``no new taxes'' campaign pledge in acknowledging
that ``tax revenue increases'' are needed to cut the deficit.
   ``Well, I've done my part and now it's their turn. A truly
comprehensive package, not a temporary Band-Aid. There must be
reform of the budget process and there must be real spending
control,'' <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> said, his voice rising to a shout. ``The American
people are entitled to that!''

<HEAD>Feinstein Buoyed By Polls In California Campaign's Final Days</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Former <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> mayor <PERSON>Dianne Feinstein</PERSON> got encouraging news
<DATE>Monday</DATE> from two new polls in the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> governor's race as she
and scores of candidates played out the final hours of primary
campaigns in nine states.
   In the often nasty Democratic primary campaign, <PERSON>Feinstein</PERSON>
maintained a lead over state Attorney General <PERSON>John Van de Kamp</PERSON> in
the latest statewide surveys. For months the two candidates have
attacked each other on issues ranging from abortion and crime to who
could best handled the state's fiscal affairs.
   Other new polls showed close races <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> for gubernatorial
nominations in <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New Mexico</LOCATION>. In <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION>, a
runoff between two Democrats will determine who challenges
Republican <PERSON>Sen. Jesse Helms</PERSON>, while four <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> Republicans were
vying for the chance to run against Democratic <PERSON>Sen. Max Baucus</PERSON>.
   <PERSON>Baucus</PERSON> was among seven incumbent senators facing token primary
opposition at most on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
   The others were Democrats <PERSON>Bill Bradley</PERSON> of <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Howell
Heflin</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Tom Harkin</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>, and Republicans <PERSON>Thad
Cochran</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Pete Domenici</PERSON> of <LOCATION>New Mexico</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Larry
Pressler</PERSON> of <LOCATION>South Dakota</LOCATION>.
   Except for <PERSON>Cochran</PERSON>, who will have no Democratic opponent in
<DATE>November</DATE>, renomination isn't necessarily a free ticket to another
term.
   Harkin faces a tough re-election race against GOP Rep. <PERSON>Tom Tauke</PERSON>,
while <PERSON>Heflin</PERSON> and <PERSON>Pressler</PERSON> also are under challenge from potentially
strong opponents. <PERSON>Heflin</PERSON>'s foe in <DATE>November</DATE> will be Republican Bill
Cabannis and <PERSON>Pressler</PERSON> will come up against <ORGANIZATION>Democrat Ted Muenster</ORGANIZATION>.
   With his outspoken conservative views, <PERSON>Helms</PERSON> attracts both
intense support and equally strong opposition. The Democrats, who
must decide between <PERSON>Harvey Gantt</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mike Easley</PERSON> for their nominee,
hope to capitalize on the latter in the general election campaign.
   <PERSON>Gantt</PERSON> led a six-candidate field in the <DATE>May 8</DATE> primary but failed
to reached the <PERCENT>40 percent</PERCENT> needed to avoid a runoff. The former mayor
of <LOCATION>Charlotte</LOCATION> is seeking to become the first black nominated for
statewide office in <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION>.
   The race for the Democratic nomination for governor of <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION>
was headed for a runoff, with none of the five contenders likely to
get the <PERCENT>50 percent</PERCENT> needed to win outright in the first round. The
top two finishers would be on the ballot for a runoff <DATE>June 26</DATE> to
decide who challenges Republican Gov. Guy Hunt.
   A <ORGANIZATION>Birmingham News-Huntsville Times</ORGANIZATION> poll published <DATE>Sunday</DATE> said
former Gov. Fob <PERSON>James</PERSON> had the support of <PERCENT>26.1 percent</PERCENT>, followed by
state Attorney General <PERSON>Don Siegelman</PERSON> with <PERCENT>25.6 percent</PERCENT>, Rep. <PERSON>Ronnie
Flippo</PERSON> 20.5 percent, teacher-lobbyist <PERSON>Paul Hubbert</PERSON> 20.1 percent and
state <PERSON>Sen. Charles Bishop</PERSON> 3.3 percent. The poll had a margin of
error of plus or minus <PERCENT>5 percentage points</PERCENT>.
   The biggest <DATE>1990</DATE> prize is the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> governor's office.
   Republican Gov. <PERSON>George Deukmejian</PERSON> is retiring after two terms and
the <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> recruited <PERSON>Sen. Pete Wilson</PERSON> to enter the race to succeed him.
Re-elected to the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1988</DATE> with <PERCENT>53 percent</PERCENT> of the vote, <PERSON>Wilson</PERSON>
became the immediate favorite to keep the office in Republican hands.
   With the <DATE>1990</DATE> Census likely to give <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> six new <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION>
seats starting with the <DATE>1992</DATE> election, control of the governor's
office could determine which party draws the new district lines.
Democrats already control both legislative chambers.
   In addition to targeting the governor's race, Republicans also
are sponsoring two ballot initiatives on redistricting in
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION>. One would take it out of the hands of the legislature,
the other would give the governor an absolute veto over any plan.
   A new <ORGANIZATION>Los Angeles Times</ORGANIZATION> poll said <PERSON>Feinstein</PERSON> had a 13-point lead _
a gain of two points over a similar survey early in <DATE>May</DATE>. The poll
gave the former mayor <PERCENT>42 percent</PERCENT> and <ORGANIZATION>Van de Kamp</ORGANIZATION> <PERCENT>29 percent</PERCENT>. There
were <PERCENT>29 percent</PERCENT> still undecided or supporting one of the nine minor
candidates on the Democratic primary ballot. The survey had a <PERCENT>5
percentage point</PERCENT> margin of error.
   <ORGANIZATION>Mervin Field</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> Poll, which gave <PERSON>Feinstein</PERSON> a slim <PERCENT>3
percent</PERCENT> lead earlier this month, reported that margin had opened up
to 8 points over <LOCATION>Van de Kamp</LOCATION>, 42-34, in polling that concluded
<DATE>Sunday</DATE>. It had a <PERCENT>3.5 percentage point</PERCENT> margin of error.
   A new <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION> poll in the race for the Democratic nomination for
governor was published <DATE>Sunday</DATE> in theDes Moines Register and said
<ORGANIZATION>Iowa House</ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON>Don Avenson</PERSON> had moved into the lead with support
from <PERCENT>32 percent</PERCENT> of those surveyed, compared with <PERCENT>25 percent</PERCENT> for
state Attorney General <PERSON>Tom Miller</PERSON>. Former banker <PERSON>John Chrystal</PERSON> was
at <PERCENT>19 percent</PERCENT>, and <PERCENT>20 percent</PERCENT> said they were undecided. The survey
had a margin of error of 3.9 percentage points.
   The winner of the Democratic primary will face Republican Gov.
<PERSON>Terry Branstad</PERSON> in the general election.
   In <LOCATION>New Mexico</LOCATION>, a new poll published <DATE>Sunday</DATE> in the <LOCATION>Albuquerque</LOCATION>
Journal said state <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader Les <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION> and former
legislator Frank Bond each had the support of <PERCENT>29.2 percent</PERCENT> of the
registered Republicans asked their preference in the <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION>
gubernatorial primary.
   On the Democratic side, former Gov. <PERSON>Bruce King</PERSON> had the backing of
<PERCENT>42.7 percent</PERCENT>, while state Attorney General <PERSON>Paul Bardacke</PERSON> was
supported by <PERCENT>31.5 percent</PERCENT>. The <LOCATION>New Mexico</LOCATION> survey had a margin of
error of 4 percentage points on the Democratic side and <PERCENT>5 percentage
points</PERCENT> on the <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> side.

<TEXT>
   Democrats are given a good chance of retaking the governor's
mansion in <LOCATION>Rhode Island</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION> as 12
states fill their top job in contests that have grown closer and
nastier with the approach of Election Day.
   Allegations of racism shadow <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION>'s campaign; in <LOCATION>Rhode Island</LOCATION>,
the hiring of a reputed mobster's ex-wife for a state job has become
an issue, and the race in <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION> has used television with
notably creative malice.
   Democrats hold 27 of the 50 governorships. Nine incumbents _ six
Republicans and three Democrats _ will be on the ballot. Republican
<PERSON>Robert Orr</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION> is barred by law from a third term; <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>
Democrat <PERSON>Ted Schwinden</PERSON> and <LOCATION>New Hampshire</LOCATION> Republican <PERSON>John Sununu</PERSON> are
retiring.
   If Massachussetts' <PERSON>Michael Dukakis</PERSON> is elected president, Lt. Gov.
<PERSON>Evelyn Murphy</PERSON>, also a Democrat, will serve out his term, which
expires in <DATE>1990</DATE>. In <LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION>, Lt. Gov. <PERSON>Bob Miller</PERSON> will complete the
two years remaining in fellow Democrat <PERSON>Dick Bryan</PERSON>'s term if <PERSON>Bryan</PERSON> is
elected to the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>.
   Other states electing governors are: <LOCATION>Delaware</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>North
Dakota</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Vermont</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>.
   In <LOCATION>Rhode Island</LOCATION>, Republican Gov. <PERSON>Edward D. DiPrete</PERSON> faces Democrat
<PERSON>Bruce G. Sundlun</PERSON> in a battle largely over ethics. A poll last week
for <ORGANIZATION>WPRO</ORGANIZATION> radio and WLNE-TV poll had <PERSON>Sundlun</PERSON> leading <PERCENT>44 percent</PERCENT> to <PERCENT>35
percent</PERCENT>. The margin of error was 5 points.
   The poll came after the former wife of a reputed mobster was
given a job at the <ORGANIZATION>Governor's Justice Commission</ORGANIZATION> and fired in an
uproar two days later.
   <PERSON>Sundlun</PERSON>, a communications executive who lost to <ORGANIZATION>DiPrete</ORGANIZATION> by a
landslide in <DATE>1986</DATE>, also has capitalized on news stories about
<PERSON>DiPrete</PERSON> family land deals, an unfinished bridge, and state contracts
awarded to <ORGANIZATION>DiPrete</ORGANIZATION> campaign contributors.
   DiPrete, in turn, has accused <PERSON>Sundlun</PERSON> of business misconduct and
mismanagement.
   Republican Gov. <PERSON>Arch Moore</PERSON>'s bid for an unprecedented fourth term
in economically depressed <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION> appears headed for defeat at
the hands of an insurance executive and political novice who spent a
record <MONEY>$2.1 million</MONEY> on the primary alone. Unemployment is high and
the government had to borrow <MONEY>$80 million</MONEY> to keep going this year.
Democrat <PERSON>Gaston Caperton</PERSON> held a double-digit lead in recent polls.
   In <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION>, Republican Lt. Gov. <PERSON>John M. Mutz</PERSON> is turning up the
heat in an underdog race against the 32-year-old son of former <PERSON>Sen.
Birch E. Bayh</PERSON>, a contest being watched for the coattail effect of
the Bush-Quayle ticket in <PERSON>Sen. Dan Quayle</PERSON>'s home state.
   <PERSON>Evan Bayh</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION> secretary of state, leads by a much as 13
points in the most recent polls and stands to become the first
Democrat elected governor of <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION> since <DATE>1964</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Mutz</PERSON> has charged that a Bayh TV commercial ``appeals to the
darker side of the human personality'' by evoking racist sentiments
against the Japanese. The ad contends many of the best jobs at a
state-subsidized Subaru-Isuzu auto plant will go to workers of
Japanese ancestry.
   An indignant <PERSON>Bayh</PERSON> responded, ``I would never do anything to
appeal to anyone's racial bigotry.''
   In <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION>, Republican <PERSON>Norm Bangerter</PERSON>'s bid for a second term is in
deep trouble against Democrat <PERSON>Ted Wilson</PERSON>, former mayor of Salt <LOCATION>Lake
City</LOCATION>. Wilson leads by as much as 12 points, down from 20 last month,
and independent <ORGANIZATION>Merrill Cook</ORGANIZATION> has robbed <PERSON>Bangerter</PERSON> of support from
conservative Republicans who blame him for the biggest tax increase
in <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION> history.
   In <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION>, Republican Gov. <PERSON>Jim Martin</PERSON> leads Lt. Gov. <PERSON>Bob
Jordan</PERSON>, a Democrat, in a campaign that has made for good TV.
   <PERSON>Jordan</PERSON> has lampooned <ORGANIZATION>Martin</ORGANIZATION>'s budget-writing process with a
commercial starring chimpanzees in business suits. Martin has run an
ad with footage of <PERSON>Jordan</PERSON> telling black newspaper editors he agrees
with them on some issues but won't discuss them publicly for fear of
alienating ``rednecks.''
   DELAWARE _ Republican <PERSON>Michael Castle</PERSON> has only token opposition in
his bid for a second term against Democrat <PERSON>Jacob Kreshtool</PERSON>.
   MISSOURI _ Republican Gov. <PERSON>John Ashcroft</PERSON> is strongly favored
against Democratic state Rep. <PERSON>Betty Hearnes</PERSON>, wife of a former
governor.
   <LOCATION>MONTANA</LOCATION> _ A comeback attempt by former Gov. <PERSON>Thomas Judge</PERSON>, a
Democrat, against Republican state <PERSON>Sen. Stan Stephens</PERSON>, is seen as a
toss-up.
   NORTH DAKOTA _ Democratic Gov. <PERSON>George Sinner</PERSON> holds a commanding
lead over Republican <PERSON>Leon Mallberg</PERSON>, a businessman making his first
run for statewide office.
   NEW HAMPSHIRE _ Republican <PERSON>Judd Gregg</PERSON>, a congressman and son of a
former <LOCATION>New Hampshire</LOCATION> governor, is heavily favored over <PERSON>Paul
McEachern</PERSON>, a fierce opponent of the <PERSON>Seabrook</PERSON> nuclear plant who ran
two years ago.
   VERMONT _ <PERSON>Madeleine Kunin</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Vermont</LOCATION>'s first famale governor, has a
robust economy heavily in her favor against state <ORGANIZATION>House GOP</ORGANIZATION> leader
<PERSON>Michael Bernhardt</PERSON>.
   <LOCATION>WASHINGTON</LOCATION> _ Democrat <PERSON>Booth Gardner</PERSON> rolls toward re-election
against state Rep. <PERSON>Bob Williams</PERSON>, who comes out of the evangelical
wing of the <ORGANIZATION>Republican Party</ORGANIZATION>.

<PERSON>DiPrete</PERSON> family land deals, an unfinished bridge, and state contracts
awarded to <ORGANIZATION>DiPrete</ORGANIZATION> campaign contributors.
   DiPrete, in turn, has accused <PERSON>Sundlun</PERSON> of business misconduct and
mismanagement.
   Republican Gov. <PERSON>Arch Moore</PERSON>'s bid for an unprecedented fourth term
in economically depressed <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION> appears headed for defeat at
the hands of an insurance executive and political novice who spent a
record <MONEY>$2.1 million</MONEY> on the primary alone. Unemployment is high and
the government had to borrow <MONEY>$80 million</MONEY> to keep going this year.
Democrat <PERSON>Gaston Caperton</PERSON> held a double-digit lead in recent polls.
   In <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION>, Republican Lt. Gov. <PERSON>John M. Mutz</PERSON> is turning up the
heat in an underdog race against the 32-year-old son of former <PERSON>Sen.
Birch E. Bayh</PERSON>, a contest being watched for the coattail effect of
the Bush-Quayle ticket in <PERSON>Sen. Dan Quayle</PERSON>'s home state.
   <PERSON>Evan Bayh</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION> secretary of state, leads by a much as 13
points in the most recent polls and stands to become the first
Democrat elected governor of <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION> since <DATE>1964</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Mutz</PERSON> has charged that a Bayh TV commercial ``appeals to the
darker side of the human personality'' by evoking racist sentiments
against the Japanese. The ad contends many of the best jobs at a
state-subsidized Subaru-Isuzu auto plant will go to workers of
Japanese ancestry.
   An indignant <PERSON>Bayh</PERSON> responded, ``I would never do anything to
appeal to anyone's racial bigotry.''
   In <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION>, Republican <PERSON>Norm Bangerter</PERSON>'s bid for a second term is in
deep trouble against Democrat <PERSON>Ted Wilson</PERSON>, former mayor of Salt <LOCATION>Lake
City</LOCATION>. Wilson leads by as much as 12 points, down from 20 last month,
and independent <ORGANIZATION>Merrill Cook</ORGANIZATION> has robbed <PERSON>Bangerter</PERSON> of support from
conservative Republicans who blame him for the biggest tax increase
in <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION> history.
   In <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION>, Republican Gov. <PERSON>Jim Martin</PERSON> leads Lt. Gov. <PERSON>Bob
Jordan</PERSON>, a Democrat, in a campaign that has made for good TV.
   <PERSON>Jordan</PERSON> has lampooned <ORGANIZATION>Martin</ORGANIZATION>'s budget-writing process with a
commercial starring chimpanzees in business suits. Martin has run an
ad with footage of <PERSON>Jordan</PERSON> telling black newspaper editors he agrees
with them on some issues but won't discuss them publicly for fear of
alienating ``rednecks.''

   <PERSON>Dianne Feinstein</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>John Van de Kamp</ORGANIZATION> sweat out the voters'
verdict today in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>'s Democratic gubernatorial primary, the
featured contest on a nine-state election day that stretched from
<LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>New Mexico</LOCATION>.
   <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION>'s Democrats were picking an opponent to face
conservative Republican <PERSON>Sen. Jesse Helms</PERSON> in the <DATE>fall</DATE>. The choice in
a runoff primary was between prosecutor <PERSON>Mike Easley</PERSON> and former
<LOCATION>Charlotte</LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON>Harvey Gantt</PERSON>, bidding to become the first black
nominated for statewide office in his state.
   ``I'm ready to get into this fight'' with <PERSON>Helms</PERSON>, <PERSON>Gantt</PERSON> said as he
cast his own ballot today. ``I'm ready to get it on with him.''
   In all, five states had primaries for governor on the ballot. The
tally of <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> races ran to eight states. Dozens of members of
<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> sought nomination for new term, and waited to learn the
names of their opponents for the <DATE>November</DATE> election.
   In one statewide referendum of note, Californians were deciding
whether to accept a doubling in the statewide gasoline tax, from
<MONEY>nine cents</MONEY> a gallon to <MONEY>18 cents</MONEY> over five years. The first year's
increase would be a nickel.
   Seven incumbent senators were on the ballot, facing token
opposition at most.
   They included Democrats <PERSON>Bill Bradley</PERSON> of <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Howell Heflin</PERSON>
of <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Max Baucus</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Tom Harkin</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>; and
Republicans <PERSON>Thad Cochran</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Pete Domenici</PERSON> of <LOCATION>New Mexico</LOCATION>
and <PERSON>Larry Pressler</PERSON> of <LOCATION>South Dakota</LOCATION>. Helms already has secured the
<ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> nomination in <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION>.
   Cochran was assured of a new term, since no Democrat filed
candidate's papers for the primary.
   The statehouse races were in <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New Mexico</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>South Dakota</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, where Republican Gov. <PERSON>George Deukmejian</PERSON> is
retiring after two terms.
   GOP <PERSON>Sen. Pete Wilson</PERSON> and his <MONEY>$3.5 million</MONEY> war chest awaited the
winner of the contest between <PERSON>Feinstein</PERSON>, the former <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>
mayor, and <ORGANIZATION>Van de Kamp</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>'s attorney general.
   The Democratic race was nothing if not expensive, as both
<PERSON>Feinstein</PERSON> and Van de Kamp raised more than <MONEY>$6 million</MONEY> for their
candidacies.
   Both candidates underscored their support for abortion rights in
the final hours of their campaign.
   Feinstein campaigned to the end as tough on crime, trying to
seize an issue that seemed more likely to belong to her opponent,
the attorney general.
   She ran a late-campaign commercial on television criticizing Van
de Kamp for declining to prosecute a suspect in the Hillside
Strangler case in which 10 people were killed. Van de Kamp was the
<LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> district attorney at the time, and the suspect, <PERSON>Angelo
Buono</PERSON>, was later convicted of murder after the state attorney
general stepped into the case.
   Van de Kamp called the criticism ``baloney.''
   <LOCATION>New Mexico</LOCATION> had four-way races in both gubernatorial primaries.
   Republican Govs. Guy Hunt of <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION>, <PERSON>George Mickelson</PERSON> of <LOCATION>South
Dakota</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Terry Branstad</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION> were seeking new terms.
   <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>'s Democratic primary race was being watched for any
significance on the national debate over abortion. Democrats there
chose among three contenders _ abortion-rights supporters <PERSON>Don
Avenson</PERSON> and <PERSON>John Chrystal</PERSON> and a third contender who opposes
abortion, state Attorney General <PERSON>Tom Miller</PERSON>.
   <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>'s statehouse race was the one drawing the most
national attention.
   The state is expected to gain at least five seats in the
congressional redistricting based on the <DATE>1990</DATE> census. Republicans
are hopeful that <PERSON>Wilson</PERSON> can gain the governor's chair, and give them
a check against the heavily Democratic legislature when it comes
time to draw legislative district boundaries.
   The race for the Democratic nomination for governor of <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION>
was headed for a runoff, with none of the five contenders likely to
get the <PERCENT>50 percent</PERCENT> needed to win outright in the first round. The
top two finishers would be on the ballot for a runoff <DATE>June 26</DATE> to
decide the challenger to Republican Gov. Guy Hunt.
   In the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> contests, Republican Rep. <PERSON>Tom Tauke</PERSON> was on the <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>
primary ballot to take on <PERSON>Harkin</PERSON> in the fall in what is expected to
be one of the nation's hottest races.
   <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Heflin</PERSON> and <LOCATION>South Dakota</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Pressler</PERSON> also are under
challenge from potentially strong opponents. <PERSON>Heflin</PERSON>'s foe in
<DATE>November</DATE> will be Republican Bill Cabannis and <PERSON>Pressler</PERSON> will come up
against <ORGANIZATION>Democrat Ted Muenster</ORGANIZATION>.
   In the <ORGANIZATION>North Carolina Senate</ORGANIZATION> race, <PERSON>Helms</PERSON> is running commercials
attacking both Democrats on the runoff primary ballot.
   <PERSON>Gantt</PERSON> led a six-candidate field in the <DATE>May 8</DATE> primary but failed
to reach the <PERCENT>40 percent</PERCENT> needed to avoid a runoff.
   Only one <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> incumbent has been defeated for renomination this
year, Republican Donald ``Buz'' <ORGANIZATION>Lukens</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>. He was convicted of
contributing to the unruliness of a minor after being accused of
having sex with her.
   A few other <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> members have had closer-than-expected primary
races, though, and such races are closely watched for signs of voter
dissatisfaction over a large congressional pay raise approved late
last year.
   In one <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> race, former professional football player <PERSON>Phil
McConkey</PERSON> in <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> is running for a <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> seat as an
anti-abortion Republican.

<TEXT>
   Some legislators want the state to cash in
on credit cards as a way of balancing demands for increased spending
and lower taxes.
   A <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> committee on <DATE>Thursday</DATE> approved legislation that would
have the state issue <ORGANIZATION>MasterCard</ORGANIZATION> or Visa cards for a commission.
   If approved by the full <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> during the next week, it would be
sent to the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>.
   This predominantly agricultural state of 804,000 residents could
reap in <MONEY>millions of dollars</MONEY> in extra revenue by sponsoring the card,
said Democratic Rep. <PERSON>Mark O'Keefe</PERSON>.
   <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>'s chief tax collector, Revenue Director <PERSON>Ken Nordtvedt</PERSON>,
thinks it's a good idea.
   ``Every organization under the sun is doing this,'' he said. ``I
have two of those cards in my pocket right now from fraternal
organizations. ...
   ``And this being our centennial year, where there's a little more
sense of pride in <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Department of Revenue</ORGANIZATION> is certainly
willing to administer such a program,'' he said.
   O'Keefe, who sponsored the legislation, said the idea came from a
constituent.
   ``At first, I thought the guy was crazy,'' <PERSON>O'Keefe</PERSON> said. ``But
the more I looked into it, it seemed it was not only legal but it
might work.''
   The card would have a special <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> design and would be issued
by banks, which would assume all liability and would process the
transactions, <PERSON>O'Keefe</PERSON> said.
   Each bank would pay the state a commission, perhaps <PERCENT>1 percent</PERCENT> of
sales.
   The plan could mean up to <MONEY>$7.6 million</MONEY> a year for the state,
depending on the terms it negotiates with banks and how popular the
card becomes, <PERSON>O'Keefe</PERSON> said.
   Such groups as labor unions, wildlife organizations and the
<ORGANIZATION>National Rifle Association</ORGANIZATION> sponsor such ``affinity'' cards, <PERSON>O'Keefe</PERSON>
said. Banks like the idea because it gives them a broader base of
cardholders and more interest income.
   ``It's such a cutthroat industry that the affinity cards have
become big business for banks,'' he said. ``It increases the number
of people who want to carry these cards and all of these
organizations are making money on it.''
   O'Keefe, who believes <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> would be the first government
entity in the nation to try the idea, took his proposal to the <ORGANIZATION>House
Taxation Committee</ORGANIZATION> this week.
   There, a lobbyist for the <ORGANIZATION>Montana League of Savings Institutions</ORGANIZATION>
liked it so much he proposed an amendment to allow savings and loans
to participate along with banks.
   The panel questioned whether state funds would be at risk under
such a plan, as collateral for credit charged to the cards. But
<PERSON>O'Keefe</PERSON> said participating banks would assume all the risk.
   The bill, approved 13-5 by the committee, calls for half the
money generated by commissions to go to the state's general fund.
   The rest would be used for public schools, which must receive
more state money because of a <DATE>February</DATE> ruling by the <ORGANIZATION>state Supreme
Court</ORGANIZATION> overturning <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>'s school finance system.
   Using the card to support public schools would only be right,
<PERSON>O'Keefe</PERSON> said, considering all the retired Montanans who spend their
summers in the mountains but desert <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> in the winter for the
Sunbelt.
   ``All of our snowbirds in <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION> all <DATE>winter</DATE> _ <PERCENT>1 percent</PERCENT> of their
purchases could come back to fund their grandchildren's education,''
<PERSON>O'Keefe</PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Montana is Proud of its Tyrannosaurus Rex</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE DENNISON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOZEMAN, Mont. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When trucker <PERSON>Bill McKamey</PERSON> heard that
<LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>'s Museum of the Rockies had found a Tyrannosaurus rex
skeleton, he offered to make his vehicle and services available any
time, anywhere.
   ``How many times in your life do you haul a dinosaur?'' he
asked.
   The fossil T-rex found in the badlands of eastern <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> is the
largest and most complete skeleton of a Tyrannosaurus ever
discovered. It also is the first of four T-rex skeletons discovered
in <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> that will be staying here.
   That has become a source of pride for people in <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>.
   McKamey, for example, was one of scores of volunteers who helped
bring the fossil of the meat-eating beast from its 65
million-year-old bed in the dry, rugged territory around the
<LOCATION>Missouri River</LOCATION> to the display room in <LOCATION>Bozeman</LOCATION>.
   Although the Tyrannosaurus is the best known dinosaur, only
eight have been found - four in <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>, two in <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> and one each
in <LOCATION>South Dakota</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION>.
   While <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> may be the most fertile hunting ground for the
T-rex, none of the fossils has stayed in the state.
   ``Until this, I didn't realize how many people were upset about
fossils going out of state,'' said <PERSON>Pat Leiggi</PERSON>, chief preparator of
paleontology for the museum. ``A lot of people told me they had a
ranch here and there, and certain people would come and take
fossils out and they never heard about them again.''
   He said that until the Museum of the Rockies opened its
paleontology department eight years ago, the state had no facility
to research the fossils. Now the museum has one of the largest
palentology departments in the country, and it has more of a say.
   ``Now, we know who's doing what,'' he said. ``<LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> is in this
network of paleontology departments.''
   The Tyrannosarus rex was the largest carnivore ever to walk the
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. It grew to 35 to 40 feet long and up to 12 feet high, with
teeth 6 inches long.
   Museum staffers dug up the <PERCENT>90 percent</PERCENT> complete skeleton over
four weeks this <DATE>summer</DATE> on federal land near the small farming town
of Circle.
   <ORGANIZATION>Army Corps of Engineer</ORGANIZATION> engineers built a dirt road into the
remote site and helped load the seven tons of fossils onto trucks.
McKamey was waiting nearby with a flatbed truck and hauled the
bones nearly 400 miles to the museum at <ORGANIZATION>Montana State University</ORGANIZATION>.
   The fossils, packed in plaster and caked with rock and hardened
mud, then had to be unloaded, weighed and set up for display. But
the museum worried that the floor wouldn't be able to support the
3{-ton pelvic section.
   ``We had a reporter in here and he wrote about it, and the next
morning, we got a whole bunch of calls, saying, `What do you need?'
It sure made my life easier,'' <PERSON>Leiggi</PERSON> said.
   Two state workers helped weigh the pieces, an architect
volunteered to examine the floor, a rental firm loaned dollies, a
construction company loaned a forklift and a driver, and a concrete
casting firm brought in a crane.
   ``We read a little blurb in the newspaper that they needed to
turn (the pelvis) over and that the largest forklift couldn't do
it,'' said <PERSON>Steve Anderson</PERSON> of <PERSON>Bozeman</PERSON>, who operated the crane. ``So
I called them and talked to them. ... It was a chance to see
something really rare.''
   Eventually, the floor was reinforced.
   Museum visitors can watch staffers cleaning and preparing the
bones in a display room, a process that will take many months. The
museum may eventually erect a mold of the skeleton or exhibit the
bones themselves.
   The skeleton was discovered almost two years ago by two amateur
fossil collectors, <PERSON>Tom</PERSON> and <PERSON>Kathy Wankel</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Angela</LOCATION>. Leiggi said a
call came from the front desk of the museum that someone had some
fossils they wanted identified.
   ``People ask us to identify bones all the time,'' he said. ``To
me it was just another bunch of people who wanted me to look at
their bones.''
   But when curator and chief paleontologist <PERSON>Jack Horner</PERSON> confirmed
that the Wankels had found the arm and hand of a Tyrannosaurus,
``our eyes were just popping out of our head,'' <PERSON>Leiggi</PERSON> said.
   Since the story broke nearly a year ago, reporters, scientists
and dinosaur enthusiasts from around the world have focused their
attention on <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>.
   ``When you find a T-rex, it turns out to be an overnight success
internationally,'' <PERSON>Leiggi</PERSON> said. ``I never expected this.''

<HEAD>Philippines Facing Serious Drug Problem</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION> may become another
<LOCATION>Colombia</LOCATION> if anti-narcotics agencies cannot stop the increasingly
powerful drug rings operating in this country, a senator said <DATE>today</DATE>.
   ``Precisely, if we do not do something about this, there might
come a time when we will see the spectacle of the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION>
becoming like <LOCATION>Colombia</LOCATION>, where drug lords even have armies,
helicopters, planes and even tanks,'' said <PERSON>Sen. Alberto Romulo</PERSON>.
   Romulo made the statement during a public hearing on last week's
report given by <PERSON>Sen. Ernesto Herrera</PERSON> alleging that at least 17
military officials are protecting drug syndicates.
   Maj. Gen. <PERSON>Ramon Montano</PERSON>, chief of the Philippine Constabulary,
admitted during the hearing that there are military men involved in
drug rings, but he said officials are doing their best to weed them
out.
   At least 40 officers have been ousted since <PERSON>Herrera</PERSON>'s report and
assigned to combat units fighting communist guerrillas in the
countryside, <PERSON>Montano</PERSON> added.
   He said the drug problem has grown swiftly in the last few
years. Most drug syndicates operating in <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION>'s so-called ``Golden
Triangle'' of <LOCATION>Burma</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Laos</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION> use the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION> as a
relay point to <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> and some
Asian countries, he said.
   A total of 2,543 people were arrested for various drug-related
offenses last year, and 1,884 were arrested from <DATE>January</DATE> to
<DATE>September this year</DATE>, <PERSON>Montano</PERSON> said.
   But <PERSON>Sen. Romulo</PERSON> said most of those arrested and convicted were
small-time pushers, and none of the three major local drug groups'
leaders or their top managers has been arrested.
   Col. <PERSON>Virgilio David</PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION>Constabulary's Narcotics
Command</ORGANIZATION>, said he plans to change men under his command as often as
possible to prevent them from fraternizing with drug ring members.
   ``The temptation is just too great for soldiers whose average
salary is about 80 pesos (<MONEY>$3.60</MONEY>) a day,'' <PERSON>David</PERSON> said.
   During the hearing, <PERSON>Herrera</PERSON> played the first of at least 15
tapes of interviews with drug pushers, military and police officers
who gave names of officers involved in corruption involving the
drug trade.
