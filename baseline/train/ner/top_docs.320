Lubbers</PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION>Bucharest</LOCATION> on <DATE>Tuesday, April 19</DATE>, for a two-day

other side of <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> and considers that transports and trade are 
especially important, said the Dutch prime minister and added 
that the <LOCATION>Rhine</LOCATION>- Main-Danube watercourse would ease the bilateral 
ties, as <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION> is located on the other end of the road and 
therefore the bilateral cooperation was extremely necessary, not 
only in the economic field but also in the political one and 
perhaps also in tourism. The Dutch premier mentioned the 
Latin-rooted language spoken by Romanians as a very special 
trait of <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>central Europe</LOCATION>. 
  On <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> [20 <DATE>April</DATE>], Premier <PERSON>Ruud Lubbers</PERSON> is scheduled

<PERSON>Mugur Isarescu</PERSON>. 
  Today <PERSON>Ruud Lubbers</PERSON> was received by Romanian President <PERSON>Ion 
Iliescu</PERSON>, at <ORGANIZATION>Cotroceni Palace</ORGANIZATION>. The Dutch guest was accompanied 
by Dutch Foreign Affairs Minister <PERSON>Peter Kooijmans</PERSON>. The visit of 
the high Dutch officials is the first of its kind since 
<LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION>'s <DATE>December 1989</DATE> revolution. 
  The interview was attended by <ORGANIZATION>Romanian Minister of Foreign 
Affairs Teodor Melescanu</ORGANIZATION>, Minister of State <PERSON>Dan Mircea Popescu</PERSON>,

  [Text] <LOCATION>Bucharest ROMPRES</LOCATION>, 6/5/1994 -- <PERSON>Carl-Dieter Spranger</PERSON>, 
German minister of economic cooperation, who has been in <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION> 
for a few days now and had multiple contacts, was received by 
Romanian President <PERSON>Ion Iliescu</PERSON> on 6 <DATE>May</DATE> <TIME>evening</TIME>. 
  At the close of the interview President Iliescu termed the 
Romanian-German relations as increasingly good, saying <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> 
was the country that understood the best <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION>'s difficulties 
caused by the processes of transformation that resembled those 
of the former GDR. "We have found with <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> a more exact 
perception of our problems in the process of transition," the 
Romanian head of state said. 
  As far as the economic relations between the two countries 
were concerned, the president pointed to the existence of mutual 
interests, explaining that both <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> were located 
"on the Rhine-Main-Danube trans-European axis, with two 
terminals, <LOCATION>Rotterdam</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Constanta</LOCATION>, and with the German economy 
at the center, which will be the engine of the general process 
of the European integration." 
  The German guest noted the good level of the bilateral 
relations. "I believe the reforms these last few years in 
<LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION>, and especially the situation after <DATE>1993</DATE> can stir the 
interest of foreign investors," he said. 
  The German minister of economic cooperation, <PERSON>Carl-Dieter 
Spranger</PERSON> met on <DATE>Friday</DATE>, 6 <DATE>May</DATE>, in <LOCATION>Bucharest</LOCATION> with the Romanian 
minister of state, head of the <ORGANIZATION>Council for Economic 
Coordination</ORGANIZATION>, Strategy, and Reform, <PERSON>Mircea Cosea</PERSON>. 
  Within his presentation of the Romanian economy, <PERSON>Mircea 
Cosea</PERSON> 
said that <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION> was giving a very special attention to its 
relations with <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>, because there existed a tradition of 
German industry presence in <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION> in the sectors of railroads, 
iron and steel industry, and telecommunications. The Romanian 
minister expressed hope that <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION> would benefit from German 
aid of capital and technology in the process of reform. <PERSON>Cosea</PERSON> 
said that the German business mentality could be a very 
important factor in the process of reform. 
  The German minister <PERSON>Carl-Dieter Spranger</PERSON> said his visit was 
a 
signal for the extending of the relations with <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION>. The 
signing of the agreement on the non-reimbursable economic 
assistance granted to <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION> is a relevant sign, said the 
German minister. 
  Minister <PERSON>Spranger</PERSON> said that <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> would send in <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION> 
experts in privatization, banking system updating, stock 
exchanges, industrial restructuring, and social protection. 
  <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION> is interested in developing a proper collaboration 
framework with <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>, that should allow for the presence of 
German businessmen here, the setting up of joint ventures, as 
well as the intensification of the actions of cooperation and 
commercial exchanges, said Romanian Prime Minister <PERSON>Nicolae 
Vacaroiu</PERSON> on 6 <DATE>May</DATE>, during his interview with <PERSON>Carl-Dieter 
Spranger</PERSON>, federal minister of economic cooperation of <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>. 
The Romanian premier assessed that the signing of the technical 
assistance agreement between the two countries was part of the 
preoccupations to improve the management of the commercial 
companies and update and retool the industrial units, especially 
those built with German technology. 
  Minister <PERSON>Spranger</PERSON> said <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> would further back <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION>'s 
efforts in the <LOCATION>European Union</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>OECD</ORGANIZATION> [<ORGANIZATION>Organization for 
Economic Cooperation and Development</ORGANIZATION>], and the <ORGANIZATION>World Bank</ORGANIZATION>. 
Referring to the German minority in <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Spranger</PERSON> said the 
Romanian state's policy with respect to that community was 
favorably regarded in his country.

  [Text] <LOCATION>Bucharest</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>ROMPRES</LOCATION>, 28/6/1994 -- For a week the 
city of Cluj-Napoca (North-West of <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION>, inhabited by a large 
Hungarian minority) has been living in a state of tension 
created by the conflict between the public authorities and the 
local branch of the <ORGANIZATION>Democratic Union of Hungarians</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION> 
(<ORGANIZATION>UDMR</ORGANIZATION>). 
  The conflict, which is not something new, because such 
situations arose several times in the capital of the historical 
Romanian province of <LOCATION>Transylvania</LOCATION>, was sparkled by the intention 
of the local authorities to authorize, at the request of the 
<ORGANIZATION>Transylvanian History Museum</ORGANIZATION>, archaeological diggings in the 
central square of the city where the monument to Hungarian King 
of Romanian descent <PERSON>Matthias Corvinus</PERSON> is located. The local 
branch of <ORGANIZATION>UDMR</ORGANIZATION> is accusing the <ORGANIZATION>City Council</ORGANIZATION>, and Mayor <PERSON>Gheorghe 
Funar</PERSON> in the first place, of using the digs as a pretext to move 
<ORGANIZATION>Corvinus</ORGANIZATION>'s statue to another location. 
  "The archaeological diggings planned to start in the <LOCATION>Union 
Square of Cluj-Napoca</LOCATION> are about 100 meters away from the statue 
of King Matthias Corvinus," the city mayor <PERSON>Gheorghe Funar</PERSON> told 
<ORGANIZATION>CRONICA ROMANA</ORGANIZATION>. 
  "The <ORGANIZATION>UDMR</ORGANIZATION> misleads its members, supporters, and the whole 
world, pretending that the unearthings pursue to create a state 
of conflict in the town," <PERSON>Gheorghe Funar</PERSON> also says. His opinion 
is that the tension aroused in the past few days is 
"artificially created, has a political connotation and was 
generated by the <ORGANIZATION>UDMR</ORGANIZATION>'s actions intended to prevent the 
archaeological investigations in the <LOCATION>Union Square</LOCATION>." He specified 
that the initiative comes from the <ORGANIZATION>History Museum of 
Transylvania of Cluj Napoca</ORGANIZATION>, which has obtained the approval of 
all the competent fora, and has allotted 10 million lei to the 
project. The mayor himself suggested the local council to 
approve another 30 million lei to sustain the project. 
  Despite assurances from local authorities that <PERSON>Matthias 
Corvinus</PERSON>'s statue will have nothing to suffer, "the <ORGANIZATION>UDMR</ORGANIZATION> 
representatives said they would stage demonstrations and urge to 
civic disobedience, and termed the matter a political issue," 
<PERSON>Gheorghe Funar</PERSON> said. Should any acts of civic disorder appear 
in the town, <PERSON>Gheorghe Funar</PERSON> said he would be the advocate of 
"firm enforcement of the law." 
  The daily <ORGANIZATION>ORA</ORGANIZATION> carries a commentary in its yesterday's issue 
qualifying the case as part of "the Hungarian concerted strategy 
aimed at having the <ORGANIZATION>Trianon Treaty</ORGANIZATION> canceled or revised." The 
<ORGANIZATION>Treaty of Trianon</ORGANIZATION> permitted <LOCATION>Transylvania</LOCATION> to reunite with the 
mother country after <PERSON>Habsburg</PERSON> and Hungarian occupation was 
abolished. The article in question remarked that "the plan is 
absolutely the same for all the countries having a Hungarian 
minority," and that "from this point of view, <ORGANIZATION>UDMR</ORGANIZATION> is one of the 
spearheads of this intelligent plan, obstinately followed by 
<LOCATION>Budapest</LOCATION>." 
  The archaeological investigations due to start next week in 
<LOCATION>Cluj-Napoca</LOCATION> intend to bring to light the forum of the ancient 
city of <LOCATION>Napoca</LOCATION>, a Roman colony on the territory of ancient 
<ORGANIZATION>Dacia</ORGANIZATION>, the cradle of the Romanian people and language. The city 
of Napoca used to be the capital of the <ORGANIZATION>Roman Province of Dacia 
Porolisensis</ORGANIZATION>, and <LOCATION>Cluj-Napoca</LOCATION> is celebrating <DATE>this year 1870</DATE> 
years from its first documentary attestation.

  [Text] <LOCATION>Bucharest</LOCATION>, ROMPRES, 13/6/1994 -- The transition 
process has inevitably diminished <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION>'s capacity to ensure 
its own security. <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION> does not have, as at now, allies and 
firm security guarantees. The main danger lies in having its 
own domestic weaknesses exploited. There is a direct 
relationship between the reform and the national security. 
These are some of the main ideas <PERSON>Ioan Mircea Pascu</PERSON>, secretary 
of state in the <ORGANIZATION>Romanian Ministry of National Defense</ORGANIZATION>, 
elaborated on in the comprehensive interview for the <ORGANIZATION>CURIERUL 
NATIONAL</ORGANIZATION> of 13 <DATE>June</DATE>. 
  Speaking of the integrated concept of <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION>'s national 
security, a recently issued document, <PERSON>Pascu</PERSON> says the study ends 
with the basic conclusion that for now and for a while to come, 
"<LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION> cannot rely on allies and firm security guarantees." 
Besides, the transition from one type of society to another has 
diminished its capacity to ensure security by its own means, 
"particularly as we are located in an area characterized by a 
high degree of conflict potential." 
  In <PERSON>Mr. Pascu</PERSON>'s opinion, the most important sign of <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION>'s 
insecurity since <DATE>December 1989</DATE> is the very fact that threats are 
no longer mostly external, and that "the main danger is posed by 
the possibility of having its domestic weaknesses exploited." 
And among the main internal risk factors he listed the economic 
situation, the social costs required by the changes brought 
about by the transition period, a diminished social cohesion etc. 
  To face the domestic risk factors this country needs to 
ensure the continuity of the reform process: "the success of the 
reform, however cannot be obtained in the absence of security, 
and to have security, we need to take the reform to the end 
successfully." 
  The defense official also mentioned some of the external 
risk 
factors for <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION>'s security, such as the appearance and 
worsening of certain conflicts, the existence of zones with a 
high potential of political and military instability close to 
<LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION>. 
  As directly concerning <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION>'s security, Secretary of 
State 
<PERSON>Mircea Pascu</PERSON> names international developments like the recent 
stability plan adopted in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>, the agreement for the reduction 
of the conventional armaments and troops in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, the 
Partnership for Peace plan, <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION>'s geopolitical position, the 
relations with <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION>. 
  Concluding, the dignitary predicted about the future of 
<LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION>'s security in the following terms: "If we ignore the 
unpredictable, which, unfortunately, will continue to be there 
both in the near and medium future, I think we can be optimistic 
about <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION>'s long- term chances of integration in the 
European and Euro-Atlantic security systems."

  [Excerpts] <LOCATION>Bucharest</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>ROMPRES</LOCATION>, 2/3/1994 -- Foreign 
Ministry Spokesman <PERSON>Mircea Geoana</PERSON> announced at the today's news 
conference President <PERSON>Ion Iliescu</PERSON>'s unofficial visit to <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> on 
11-14 <DATE>March this year</DATE> at the invitation of the <ORGANIZATION>Chinese 
Government</ORGANIZATION>. The Romanian president will be shown the special 
economic zones in the <LOCATION>South of China</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Shen Zhen</PERSON> and <PERSON>Zhu Hai</PERSON>, the 
<LOCATION>Quandong Canton Province</LOCATION> where, the Romanian delegation will 
meet with the local administration. The president will be 
accompanied by a group of Romanian businessmen, executives of 
state and private companies, and will examine the prospects of 
cooperation between the two countries. [passage omitted] 
  The spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION>Foreign Ministry</ORGANIZATION> read a communique at 
a 
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, <DATE>March 2</DATE>, press conference, saying that the <ORGANIZATION>Romanian 
Foreign Ministry</ORGANIZATION> has taken note with satisfaction of the 
agreement on the creation of a <ORGANIZATION>Croatian-Muslim Federation</ORGANIZATION> in 
<LOCATION>Bosnia</LOCATION>- <LOCATION>Herzegovina</LOCATION> and of a confederation made up of the said 
federation and <LOCATION>Croatia</LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION>Romanian Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs</ORGANIZATION> considers that the putting in place of the provisions of 
this accord would represent an important step in finding a 
political solution to the crisis in <LOCATION>Bosnia-Herzegovina</LOCATION>, in 
parallel with solutions for the other problems under 
negotiation. The <ORGANIZATION>Foreign Ministry</ORGANIZATION> expresses hope that this 
favorable moment will be made good use of in the interest of all 
the parties, of stability and security in the region, reads the 
communique. 
  The relations between <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Moldova</LOCATION> are not function 
of 
the electoral cycle, which was already proved when elections 
were held in <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION>Foreign Ministry</ORGANIZATION> Spokesman <PERSON>Mircea 
Geoana</PERSON> at his <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, <DATE>March 2</DATE>, press conference, speaking 
about the elections held in the Republic of <LOCATION>Moldova</LOCATION> on <DATE>February 
27</DATE>. 
  The results of the polls reflect the state of mind of the 
population and they can be interpreted in terms of the economic 
and social difficulties confronting the Republic of <LOCATION>Moldova</LOCATION>, of 
the way in which the electorate took those aspects of the 
programmes of the parties running for seats in parliament that 
refer to the current situation of the country, mentioned the 
spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION>Foreign Ministry</ORGANIZATION>. An evaluation of the 
results has to take into account the conditions specific to the 
Republic of <LOCATION>Moldova</LOCATION>, the tensions appeared in consequence of the 
situation in <LOCATION>Dniester</LOCATION> and the districts inhabited by <LOCATION>Gagauz</LOCATION>, the 
general evolutions in the former Soviet space. "That is how the 
option for the left can be explained, the relative high percent 
of vote got by the bloc formed of the <ORGANIZATION>Socialist Party</ORGANIZATION> (the 
former <ORGANIZATION>Communist Party</ORGANIZATION>) and the "unity" party. It is 
interesting to mention, nevertheless, that the Democratic 
Agrarian Party had the biggest number of seats in the previous 
parliament and it has preserved its position, added <PERSON>Geoana</PERSON>. 
  At the 2 <DATE>March</DATE> weekly news conference of the <ORGANIZATION>Romanian 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs</ORGANIZATION>, Spokesman <PERSON>Mircea Geoana</PERSON> referred to 
the statement of 28 <DATE>February</DATE> of the <ORGANIZATION>Council of Representatives</ORGANIZATION> 
of the <ORGANIZATION>Hungarian Democratic Union of Romania</ORGANIZATION> (<ORGANIZATION>UDMR</ORGANIZATION>), issued as a 
follow-up and in response to a letter sent to this body by 
Bishop <PERSON>Laszlo Tokes</PERSON>. The spokesman said that the letter 
confirms, once again, the extremist and anti-Romanian angle from 
which <PERSON>Pastor Tokes</PERSON>, encouraged by some <ORGANIZATION>UDMR</ORGANIZATION> leaders and 
political persons in <LOCATION>Hungary</LOCATION>, approaches his relations with the 
Romanian state and with <ORGANIZATION>UDMR</ORGANIZATION> itself. 
  "We express the hope that the <ORGANIZATION>UDMR</ORGANIZATION> leaders will distance 
themselves from the positions of the honorary president of their 
party, in whose view at present in <LOCATION>Romania Ceausescu</LOCATION>'s policies 
on minorities are being continued. It is only to be regretted 
that the declaration issued by the <ORGANIZATION>UDMR</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Council of 
Representatives</ORGANIZATION> practically reiterates all the accusations 
listed in the instruction-letter of Pastor Tokes. <ORGANIZATION>UDMR</ORGANIZATION>'s 
declaration is accusing the Romanian authorities of lacking the 
political will to implement the amendments of the <ORGANIZATION>Council of 
Europe</ORGANIZATION>. We think it is high time <ORGANIZATION>UDMR</ORGANIZATION> understood that the 
addressee of these amendments is the Romanian society as a whole 
and that the observance of the commitments made before the 
<ORGANIZATION>Council</ORGANIZATION> on <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION>'s admission to it is a matter of national 
interest," the spokesman said. He also stressed that the 
withdrawal of <ORGANIZATION>UDMR</ORGANIZATION> from the <ORGANIZATION>Council for Ethnic Minorities</ORGANIZATION> -- the 
place where it would be but natural that such problems were 
debated -- reveals the lack of both real interest and pragmatism 
in solving them, and lack of consideration for the interests and 
role of the other ethnic minorities in <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION>. 
  "The <ORGANIZATION>Ministry of Foreign Affairs</ORGANIZATION> expresses the confidence 
that, joining the competent institutions in the rapid 
finalization of this process, all the forces interested in 
proving the democratic propensity and realities of <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION> will 
bring a constructive and sincere contribution," the <ORGANIZATION>Foreign 
Ministry</ORGANIZATION> spokesman concluded.

<FÊP=106> [From the 16 March Romanian press review] </F>
  [Excerpt] <LOCATION>Bucharest ROMPRES</LOCATION>, 16/3/1994 -- "Irredentist 
Fangs in <LOCATION>Bucharest</LOCATION> and in <LOCATION>Transylvania</LOCATION>" is the headline in daily 
ADEVARUL of the set of reports on the observance of the 
anniversary of the <DATE>1848</DATE> revolution by the ethnic Hungarian in 
<LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION>. The matter is covered by all newspapers that emphasize 
the attempt of the <ORGANIZATION>Democratic Union</ORGANIZATION> of Hungarians in <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION> 
[<ORGANIZATION>UDMR</ORGANIZATION>] Deputy <PERSON>Imre Borbely</PERSON> to make an address in Hungarian in 
<LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION>. "To speak Hungarian before the <ORGANIZATION>Chamber of 
Deputies</ORGANIZATION> means an official offense to the country and to the 
fellow parliamentarians," writes daily <PERSON>CRONICA ROMANA</PERSON>, noting 
that "this characteristic rudeness of <PERSON>Mr. Borbely</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>UDMR</ORGANIZATION> 
hardliner, (...) serves only those accused of nationalism (...) 
and we must admit that in such situations they are right, 
because one needs not be a nationalist to feel offended in one's 
own home, in one's own country, and in one's own parliament." 
  Daily <ORGANIZATION>ORA</ORGANIZATION> covers the visit paid to <LOCATION>Transylvania</LOCATION> by high 
state 
officials of <LOCATION>Hungary</LOCATION> in order to celebrate together with the 
Hungarian minority there the memory of the <DATE>1848</DATE> revolution. 
"The <ORGANIZATION>Hungarian Government</ORGANIZATION>'s gesture to celebrate at high level 
the event that was a happy one for them and a tragical one for 
us, is impolite and this is an understatement (...). It is 
offending the Romanians' feelings" daily ORA writes. "The 
Hungarian revisionism is behaving as if the Hungarian empire 
existed, temporarily subjected to different, unjust laws, but 
still an empire, consequently the government has to participate 
in the festivities in its eternal provinces, irrespective of the 
present situation (...) The Hungarian revisionism tries in 
every possible way [to achieve] <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION>'s isolation from the 
community of European states. In an isolated <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION>, subject 
to the quarantine of civilization, the difficult mission has 
been assumed by the <ORGANIZATION>UDMR</ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION> there is a 
party hostile to <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION>, that despises the Romanian nation."

  [Text] <LOCATION>Bucharest ROMPRES</LOCATION>, 31/5/1994 -- Romanian President 
<PERSON>Ion Iliescu</PERSON> received at <ORGANIZATION>Cotroceni Palace</ORGANIZATION> on 31 <DATE>May</DATE> <PERSON>Miltiades 
Evert</PERSON>, president of the New Democracy Party of the <ORGANIZATION>Hellenic 
Republic</ORGANIZATION>, leader of the opposition in <LOCATION>Greece</LOCATION>. 
  After recalling the fine relations between <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION> and 
<LOCATION>Greece</LOCATION>, even at the time when the two countries belonged to 
differing social systems, the Hellenic politician pleaded in a 
press statement for the necessity of establishing a climate of 
peace in the <LOCATION>Balkans</LOCATION>. "<LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Bulgaria</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Greece</LOCATION> are spaces 
of stability and these countries have to take over the 
initiative of pacifying the <LOCATION>Balkans</LOCATION>," <PERSON>Miltiades Evert</PERSON> said. 
  He mentioned he proposed to the Romanian president "the 
signing of an agreement on existing frontiers intangibility" by 
the Balkan countries, as well as the passage to concrete 
measures for such a document to be signed the soonest. "The 
signing of such an agreement would be the first great step 
toward peace in the <LOCATION>Balkans</LOCATION>, that should be ensured first of all 
by the Balkan peoples," he added. 
  In the same context, <PERSON>Miltiades Evert</PERSON> said that the signing 
of 
the proposed agreement would be difficult at this moment for 
<LOCATION>Serbia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Croatia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Bosnia</LOCATION>, countries that are at war now, but 
the other states in the zone, he said, were bound to do it 
"precisely in order to prevent the expansion of the conflict and 
to ensure welfare and economic development in the <LOCATION>Balkans</LOCATION>." 
  The conclusion of treaties to guarantee the current 
frontiers 
can be a first step toward securing peace in the <LOCATION>Balkans</LOCATION>, 
assessed <PERSON>Miltiadis Evert</PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION>New Democracy Party 
of Greece</ORGANIZATION>, during an interview with <ORGANIZATION>Romanian Minister of Labour</ORGANIZATION> 
and Social Protection <PERSON>Dan Mircea Popescu</PERSON>, in <LOCATION>Bucharest</LOCATION>, on 31 
<DATE>May</DATE>. 
  The interview occasioned a survey of the stage of the 
bilateral relations which, they assessed, had to be increased 
and diversified, as well as the approach of stability and 
cooperation in the <LOCATION>Balkans</LOCATION>. 
  Minister <PERSON>Dan Mircea Popescu</PERSON> outlined to the guest the 
<ORGANIZATION>Romanian Government</ORGANIZATION>'s current priorities, emphasizing among them 
the securing of an adequate social protection and an increasing 
living standard of the population. He considered the 
difficulties <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION> was going through at this time could be 
eased only through good-quality work, an efficient management 
and steady international economic cooperation, which, between 
<LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Greece</LOCATION>, could be achieved on multiple planes.

  [Text] <LOCATION>Bucharest</LOCATION>, ROMPRES, 17/1/1994 -- "It was an attempt 
against the constitutional democracy in <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION>," said Romanian 
Constitutional Court <PERSON>Judge Antonie Iorgovan</PERSON>, cited by the daily 
ADEVARUL, referring to the news broadcasted by the <ORGANIZATION>National 
Television</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, <DATE>January 14</DATE>, informing that the Hungarian 
Democratic Union of <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION> [<ORGANIZATION>UDMR</ORGANIZATION>], the ethnic party of the 
Hungarian minority, had met with mayors of several localities to 
discuss the issue of "self-governing." 
  <PERSON>Judge Antonie Iorgovan</PERSON>, who is also professor of 
constitutional law of the <ORGANIZATION>Bucharest University</ORGANIZATION>, reminds that 
<LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION>'s constitution does not provide such a concept because 
of the simple reason that there is only one government in a 
unitary state, politically responsible in front of the single 
parliament as the representative body of the Romanian nation." 
  <PERSON>Antonie Iorgovan</PERSON> reminded also that the "self-governing" 
wording was not stipulated by any unitary state's constitution 
in <LOCATION>Western Europe</LOCATION> as they consecrated a regional system of local 
administration and not a departmental system." <PERSON>Antonie Iorgovan</PERSON> 
draws attention also to the fact that even though only a 
departmental system of administrative-territorial organization 
in counties exists in <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION> and not one recognizing regions, 
lands, provinces or communities, "there are political forces who 
employ such wording." Judge Iorgovan cites the Article 31, 
Paragraph 7, of the constitution as saying: "Any defamation of 
the country and the nation, instigation to a war of aggression, 
to national, racial, class or religious hatred, any incitement 
to discrimination, territorial separatism, public violence as 
well as an obscene conduct contrary to morality are prohibited 
by law." 
  The public opinion in <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION> has repeatedly showed in the 
recent years, its concern with regard to the statements made by 
several <ORGANIZATION>UDMR</ORGANIZATION> leaders questioning directly or in a dissimulated 
way the issue of <LOCATION>Transylvania</LOCATION>, ancient Romanian territory, 
temporarily under the rule of the Austro-Hungarian <PERSON>Habsburg</PERSON> 
empire, till <DATE>1918</DATE>. 
  According to the <DATE>January 1992</DATE> census, the population of the 
counties of the historic province of <LOCATION>Transylvania</LOCATION> is made up by 
Romanians with <PERCENT>72.3 percent</PERCENT>.

<ORGANIZATION>North-Atlantic Council Held</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION> on <DATE>January 10-11</DATE>, <DATE>1994</DATE>." 
  Political and organisation measures have been enlisted in 
the 
document intended to secure a democratic control on the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> and 
facilitate transparency in planning national defence and 
drafting the budget, fields of cooperation, human and logistic 
resources that <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION> can contribute to the <ORGANIZATION>Partnership for 
Peace</ORGANIZATION> plan.

  [Text] <LOCATION>Bucharest ROMPRES</LOCATION>, 20/4/1994 -- Foreign Ministry 
Spokesman <PERSON>Mircea Geoana</PERSON> made a few points on news items in the 
Romanian media on the Romanian-Hungarian treaty, during a news 
conference he held in <LOCATION>Bucharest</LOCATION> on 20 <DATE>April</DATE>. The news items 
claimed that "sources at the <ORGANIZATION>Foreign Ministry</ORGANIZATION> and the presidency 
said that, pursuant to <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>NATO</ORGANIZATION> pressures, the basic 
Romanian-Hungarian political treaty will be signed by 1 <DATE>July, 
1994</DATE>." 
  <PERSON>Mircea Geoana</PERSON> denied the existence of such an understanding 
and said that as far as <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION> was concerned, it was interested 
to conclude the political treaty with <LOCATION>Hungary</LOCATION> the soonest. 
"Even before the <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> conference or <DATE>26-27 May</DATE>, when the 
`stability' pact initiated by <PERSON>Balladur</PERSON> is launched, we would 
like to do it," said <PERSON>Mircea Geoana</PERSON>. He added that <LOCATION>Hungary</LOCATION> has 
not stated its stand on the proposals advanced long ago by the 
<ORGANIZATION>Romanian Foreign Ministry</ORGANIZATION> regarding the outstanding issues. "If 
we got an answer and were able to agree on a new round of 
negotiations, this would be a positive element in the actuation 
of the Romanian-Hungarian political dialogue," he said. 
  Regarding the issue of lifting the embargo against the 
<ORGANIZATION>Federal Republic of Yugoslavia</ORGANIZATION>, "from what we know this is not 
envisaged for now" -- Foreign Ministry Spokesman <PERSON>Mircea Geoana</PERSON> 
said, referring to the "official launch" of the joint demarche 
of <LOCATION>Greece</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Bulgaria</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION> in this respect. The <ORGANIZATION>Foreign 
Ministry</ORGANIZATION> spokesman said such a demarche ought to be made at the 
right time, when the process of political negotiations reaches a 
congenial stage. "In keeping with the evolution of the 
negotiations between the Bosnian conflicting parties, a decision 
will be analyzed and made by all parties concerned", he said, 
adding that <LOCATION>Hungary</LOCATION> showed interest in the demarche, while 
<LOCATION>Ukraine</LOCATION> did not state its stand. 
  The idea of a joint demarche of <LOCATION>Greece</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Bulgaria</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION> 
for the lifting of the embargo on the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia</ORGANIZATION> was launched during the <LOCATION>Bucharest</LOCATION> visit by the Greek 
foreign minister a few weeks ago. The initiative pursues the 
easing of the negative effects emerged following the application 
of the <ORGANIZATION>UN</ORGANIZATION> sanctions by the countries neighbouring <LOCATION>ex-Yugoslavia</LOCATION>. 
  The prime minister of the Grand Duchy of <LOCATION>Luxembourg</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Jacques 
Smiter</PERSON>, will make an official visit in <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION> over <DATE>April 24-26</DATE> 
at the invitation of the Romanian Prime Minister <PERSON>Nicolae 
Vacaroiu</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>Romanian Foreign Ministry</ORGANIZATION> spokesman also said. 
  The agenda of the visit includes official talks with the 
Romanian premier, interviews with Romanian President <PERSON>Ion 
Iliescu</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON>Oliviu Gherman</PERSON>, Chamber of Deputies 
Speaker <PERSON>Adrian Nastase</PERSON>. 
  On the occasion of the visit, an inter-governmental 
agreement 
of cooperation in the fields of culture, education, science and 
sport will be signed. 
  The postponement of the signing of the basic political 
treaty 
between <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Republic</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Yugoslavia</LOCATION>, first 
scheduled to take place while Yugoslav Federal President <PERSON>Zoran 
Lilic</PERSON> was in <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION> for the <ORGANIZATION>Crans Montana Forum</ORGANIZATION>, stirred the 
interest of the journalists who attended the <ORGANIZATION>Foreign Ministry</ORGANIZATION> 
briefing on 20 <DATE>April</DATE>. Confirming President <PERSON>Lilic</PERSON> would not 
attend the Forum because of the tense situation in <LOCATION>Bosnia</LOCATION>, 
<PERSON>Mircea Geoana</PERSON> said the official document would be signed only 
after the two parties agreed on all issues. "It is an important 
political document with a neighbour state, that has to fall in 
line with the whole of the political treaties <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION> is 
concluding with other states of the world," he added. "It is 
not to be achieved upon conjunctural bases, statuting instead 
the format of bilateral relations in all spheres." 
  Referring to the conflict in <LOCATION>Gorazde</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Romanian Foreign 
Ministry</ORGANIZATION> spokesman reiterated <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION>'s constant stand relying 
upon the principle of using the whole range of 
political-diplomatic means to induce the conflicting parties to 
go on negotiating. "We follow with worry the events in <LOCATION>Gorazde</LOCATION> 
and see the high rate of contacts and statements by all parties 
concerned, which leaves room for optimism," <PERSON>Geoana</PERSON> said.

  [Text] <LOCATION>Bucharest ROMPRES</LOCATION>, 8/4/1994 -- <PERSON>Geza Entz</PERSON>, member of 
the <ORGANIZATION>Hungarian Government</ORGANIZATION>, paid his Romanian visit in spite of 
the fact that the <ORGANIZATION>Romanian Foreign Ministry</ORGANIZATION> was emphatic about 
abstaining from this until Romanian authorities agreed. "It is 
regrettable that the Hungarian dignitary chose to ignore the 
Romanian authorities", said Ambassador <PERSON>Traian Chebeleu</PERSON> during a 
news conference on 8 <DATE>April</DATE>, in answering a ROMPRES question. 
  Referring to the same aspect, the presidential spokesman 
showed that the Romanian authorities were worried by that 
gesture "that accounts for a very serious brake in the efforts 
to normalize the Romanian-Hungarian relations and conclude the 
basic treaty between the two countries," as the <LOCATION>Budapest</LOCATION> 
official's behaviour defied the principles of inter-state 
relations. 
  Referring to the pardoning of the ethnic Hungarians involved 
in the crimes at <LOCATION>Zetea</LOCATION> and Dealu, <LOCATION>Harghita County</LOCATION>, presidential 
spokesman <PERSON>Traian Chebeleu</PERSON> said it was not complete. It was made 
in such a way as to have the convicts eligible for parole while 
the final decision would be made in keeping with the existing 
procedures by the local court. 
  As regarded the treaty envisaged to be concluded with the 
<ORGANIZATION>Federal Republic of Yugoslavia</ORGANIZATION>, Ambassador <PERSON>Chebeleu</PERSON> said it was 
part of <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION>'s policy of equal treatment of all states in the 
territory of former <LOCATION>Yugoslavia</LOCATION>. 
  The statement of Moldovan Prime Minister <PERSON>Andrei Sangheli</PERSON>, 
who 
did not name <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION> among the countries that gave the Republic 
of <LOCATION>Moldova</LOCATION> support, accusing it instead of failure to fulfil its 
obligations, was termed as "ununderstandable" by <PERSON>Traian Chebeleu</PERSON> 
who said the Romanian authorities waited for "the necessary 
explanation" that would be requested through the <ORGANIZATION>Romanian 
Embassy</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Chisinau</LOCATION>. 
  The spokesman also said President <PERSON>Ion Iliescu</PERSON> was 
represented 
at the funeral of playwright <PERSON>Eugen Ionesco</PERSON> by <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION>'s 
Ambassador in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Anton Vatasescu</PERSON>. 
  Requested to deny or confirm an alleged meeting between 
President <PERSON>Slobodan Milosevic</PERSON> and American General <PERSON>George Joulwan</PERSON> 
during the Serb head of state's stay in <LOCATION>Bucharest</LOCATION>, Ambassador 
<PERSON>Traian Chebeleu</PERSON> definitely denied it: "The meeting did not and 
could not occur because of President <PERSON>Milosevic</PERSON>'s very busy 
schedule, he said. [no closing quotation mark as received] 
  Romanian President <PERSON>Ion Iliescu</PERSON> will pay a state visit to 
<LOCATION>France</LOCATION> over <DATE>14-11 April, 1994</DATE>, presidential spokesman <PERSON>Traian 
Chebeleu</PERSON> also announced in his news conference. 
  The schedule of the visit includes, apart from talks with 
President <PERSON>Mitterrand</PERSON>, an interview with Prime Minister <PERSON>Edouard 
Balladur</PERSON>, meetings with <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON>Rene Monory</PERSON> and 
President of the National Assembly <PERSON>Philippe Seguin</PERSON>, with other 
politicians. 
  He is also expected to meet at the <ORGANIZATION>National Council</ORGANIZATION> of the 
French Employers with representatives of business circles and to 
visit the <ORGANIZATION>GEC-Alsthom</ORGANIZATION> works. 
  The presidential spokesman assessed the visit was "a natural 
moment in the evolution of the Romanian-French relations after 
the revolution and at the same time it is meant to boost them." 
Stressing that in the four years after the revolution <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> has 
given <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION> decisive support in its efforts for rapprochement 
and integration in the bodies of the European democratic states, 
Ambassador <PERSON>Traian Chebeleu</PERSON> highlighted that <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION>'s president 
attached great importance to the forthcoming political 
consultations with <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, that would cover a wide area of 
issues, from ways to further develop the bilateral relations and 
the speeding up of <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION>'s integration in the European 
institutions to the current questions of security in our zone 
and in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> generally. 
  The visit will have also an important economic dimension, 
the 
result of which we hope to be an ever more significant presence 
of the French companies in the Romanian economy, the 
presidential spokesman said.

  [Text] <LOCATION>Bucharest ROMPRES</LOCATION>, 7/2/1994 -- <PERSON>Dumitru Paslaru</PERSON>, 
spokesman of the ruling party of Social Democracy of <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION> 
(<ORGANIZATION>PDSR</ORGANIZATION>), said developments in the Republic of <LOCATION>Moldova</LOCATION>, the 
reconsideration of the stands of important political 
personalities there and their statements rendered delicate the 
continuation of the political relations and the rapprochement 
between <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION> and that state. In an interview with ROMPRES, 
<PERSON>Paslaru</PERSON> added that the <ORGANIZATION>PDSR</ORGANIZATION> considered the statements made by 
<PERSON>Snegur</PERSON> [president of the Republic of <LOCATION>Moldova</LOCATION>] and <PERSON>Motpan</PERSON> 
[president of the <ORGANIZATION>Agrarian Democratic Party of Moldova</ORGANIZATION>] to be 
inciting, offending the Romanians everywhere, an attempt at the 
country's national integrity, an obvious disconsideration of 
public opinion of the Romanian majority in the present Republic 
of <LOCATION>Moldova</LOCATION>. "We however hope these statements are just a 
temporary element in the political climate of the Republic of 
<LOCATION>Moldova</LOCATION>. These statements should better not turn into ruling 
theses and the optimistic tone of our relations of so far should 
be resumed," the <ORGANIZATION>PDSR</ORGANIZATION> spokesman also said. 
  The <ORGANIZATION>Romanian National Unity Party</ORGANIZATION> [<ORGANIZATION>PUNR</ORGANIZATION>] Vice-President 
<PERSON>Cornel Brahas</PERSON> assesses as a mistake the fact that the Romanian 
authorities recognized officially "this shadow state in 
<LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION>'s historical territory. It is an open attempt at our 
integrity and a tragical betrayal of the Romanian nation. No 
matter what eastern or western chancellories encouraged <PERSON>Snegur</PERSON> 
to assume this terrible burden, we must not give in to 
defeatism," <PERSON>Cornel Brahas</PERSON> said. 
  "I have not been taken by surprise by this statement made by 
<PERSON>Mr. Mircea Snegur</PERSON>, a good Romanian speaker but not an equally 
good Romanian. It was prepared by other political actions which 
we ignored when we did not encourage," said Professor <PERSON>Ion Coja</PERSON>, 
an outstanding member of the <ORGANIZATION>Agrarian Democratic Party of 
Romania</ORGANIZATION> (PDAR). "What's even worse is that, in a concerted 
manner, some sort of declaration of annexation of <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION>'s 
territory to the former <ORGANIZATION>USSR</ORGANIZATION> is also launched. It is high time 
that the president of <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION>, the parliament and government 
took at long last a stand that should not be criticized by the 
future generations of Romanians on either bank of the Prut," 
Professor <PERSON>Ion Coja</PERSON> said. 
  "The <ORGANIZATION>National Council of Reintegration</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>National 
Party 
of Reintegration</ORGANIZATION> have decided to `back' <PERSON>Mircea Snegur</PERSON>, 
organizing the participation in the referendum of the more than 
one million refugees or their descendants, either Romanians, 
Jews, Germans, Poles," said <PERSON>Mircea Druc</PERSON>, former prime minister 
of the Republic of <LOCATION>Moldova</LOCATION>, now president of the <ORGANIZATION>National Party 
of Reintegration</ORGANIZATION>. "A referendum of all those who were forced to 
leave their native land following the Soviet invasion. In a 
near future, we will convene also a world congress of all 
refugees because we too, want to be a part of `<PERSON>Snegur</PERSON>'s people' 
summoned to the referendum," <PERSON>Mircea Druc</PERSON> said. 
  "<PERSON>Mircea Snegur</PERSON> has proved he has remained a cent [as 
received] percent communist and no longer thinks, even for a 
moment, that he is Romanian," said <PERSON>Ion Diaconescu</PERSON>, 
vice-president of the <ORGANIZATION>Christian Democratic National Peasant 
Party</ORGANIZATION>. 
  "For him, the notion of Romanian is completely subordinated 
to the political creed for which he has campaigned for a 
lifetime. His theses are communist, they were <ORGANIZATION>Stalin</ORGANIZATION>'s as well 
and he keeps them because he grew up with them. 
  "Nobody imposes <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION>'s union with <LOCATION>Bessarabia</LOCATION> by force, 
but 
to go as far as declaring that Romanians and Moldovans are 
different peoples is a nonsense launched by communists which 
<PERSON>Mircea Snegur</PERSON>, as a truthful disciple, has adopted."

  [Text] <LOCATION>Bucharest</LOCATION>, ROMPRES, 23/06/1994 -- "<ORGANIZATION>UDMR</ORGANIZATION> [Democratic 
Union of Hungarians in <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION>] sees itself compelled to 
reassess the role and aim of its representation to parliament, 
because <ORGANIZATION>UDMR</ORGANIZATION> does not accept to act just as a stand-in in the 
country's legislative body," runs a statement made by this 
party's parliamentary group leader <PERSON>Gyula Vida</PERSON> at the end of the 
debates on the education act. 
  In the group's opinion, the "education act in its present 
form is absolutely unacceptable for the Hungarian community. It 
(the law) enacts an obvious and unspeakable discrimination 
against the ethnic minorities in <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION>, and at the same time, 
a flagrant violation of the constitution." 
  The main objections <ORGANIZATION>UDMR</ORGANIZATION> has against the draft law is the 
restriction of the constitutional right to learn in the native 
tongue in all the objects of study, the abolition of the 
existing structures of specialized education in minority 
languages, the interdiction to train in higher education 
institutions specialists in social and economic sciences, the 
inacceptance to have the confessional schools reorganized and 
re-established. 
  "The ruling (Social Democracy Party of <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION> -- <ORGANIZATION>PDSR</ORGANIZATION>) is 
visibly the prisoner of extremist political forces. The 
government's lack of political will to solve these problems 
hampers the building of a climate of social peace, destabilizing 
the Romanian society," says the <ORGANIZATION>UDMR</ORGANIZATION> lower house group statement.

  [Text] <LOCATION>Bucharest ROMPRES</LOCATION>, 7/1/1994 -- At the press 
conference of 7 <DATE>January</DATE> given by Ambassador <PERSON>Traian Chebeleu</PERSON>, 
spokesman for the Presidency of <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION>, the following points 
were made about the steps taken by the head of the Romanian 
state for <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION>'s adherence to <ORGANIZATION>NATO</ORGANIZATION>: 
  "It is not incidental that the president [Ion Iliescu] paid 
an official visit to <ORGANIZATION>NATO</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>February 1993</DATE>. Availing himself of 
this opportunity, President <PERSON>Ion Iliescu</PERSON> said before the <ORGANIZATION>NATO 
Council</ORGANIZATION>: `As a true partner, <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION> wishes to work ever closer 
with <ORGANIZATION>NATO</ORGANIZATION> and to strengthen its ties with the structures of the 
alliance, to draw closer to them, by taking part in any form of 
cooperation open to the Central European countries. Besides the 
immediate positive effects, all this would be of a nature to 
contribute to creating the prerequisites for reaching the 
strategic aim which is <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION>'s joining the <ORGANIZATION>North Atlantic 
Alliance</ORGANIZATION>. This would offer the necessary guarantees for a 
normal evolution of the irreversible process of <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION>'s 
democratization.' 
  "Subsequent to these official efforts made by the president, 
which were among the first statements of this kind on the topic 
of permitting the countries in this part of <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> access to 
<ORGANIZATION>NATO</ORGANIZATION>, messages were addressed on two different occasions -- in 
<DATE>September</DATE> and <DATE>December 1993</DATE> -- to <ORGANIZATION>NATO</ORGANIZATION> heads of state and <ORGANIZATION>NATO</ORGANIZATION> 
Secretary General <PERSON>Woerner</PERSON>, including President <PERSON>Iliescu</PERSON>'s 
considerations on the role of <ORGANIZATION>NATO</ORGANIZATION> in maintaining security in 
<LOCATION>Central</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>East Europe</LOCATION>, and the official position relative to 
the inclusion in the alliance of the countries in this part of 
<LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>. 
  "Those messages were well received by the member states of 
the alliance and found by the greatest part of their 
representatives as most welcome, straightforward, and clearly 
worded," the presidential spokesman said. 
  On receiving the letter from the president of <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION>, the 
representatives of several (<ORGANIZATION>NATO</ORGANIZATION>) states made a point of showing 
that they would support <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION> in its strive for integration in 
<ORGANIZATION>NATO</ORGANIZATION> and other Euro-Atlantic structures, knowing that <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION> 
was resolutely committed to the course of democratization and 
the rule of law, and therefore it should stay in the family of 
the democratic European states. 
  It was also shown that <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION>'s security interests would be 
considered, as well as its readiness to assume responsibilities 
in ensuring security in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>. 
  A positive assessment was made of the way <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION> responded 
to the initiative of <ORGANIZATION>Partnership for Peace</ORGANIZATION>, which several member 
countries see as a transitional stage in the gradual extension 
process of the alliance. 
  The message of the Romanian president was unanimously 
appreciated as a significant signal for the priority <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION> 
gives to enlarging its political, economic, and security 
relations with the Western countries, the spokesman for the 
presidency said.

  [Text] <LOCATION>Bucharest</LOCATION>, ROMPRES, 7/3/1994 -- The president of 
the <ORGANIZATION>Romanian Senate</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Oliviu Gherman</PERSON>, received <DATE>Monday</DATE>, 7 <DATE>March</DATE>, a 
delegation of the Alliance of the Free Democrats of <LOCATION>Hungary</LOCATION> 
[SZDSZ], led by <PERSON>Gabor Kuncze</PERSON>, leader of a parliamentary faction 
and its candidate for premiership. 
  The sides talked about the necessity to strengthen the 
bilateral parliamentary ties as a basic element for the 
improvement of the Romanian-Hungarian relations. 
  <PERSON>Oliviu Gherman</PERSON> termed the inexistence of interparliamentary 
relations of the ruling party and the opposition forces in 
<LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION> with their counterparts in <LOCATION>Hungary</LOCATION> as "illogical and 
contrary to bilateral interests" and said that as long as <ORGANIZATION>UDMR</ORGANIZATION> 
(Democratic Union of Hungarians in <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION> -- an ethnic party 
with representation to <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION>'s Parliament -- e.n.) is the sole 
parliamentary representative of <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION> to the <ORGANIZATION>Hungarian 
Parliament</ORGANIZATION>, the progress in the bilateral parliamentary 
relations will be "insignificant". <PERSON>Gabor Kuncze</PERSON> remarked that, 
given the short time lying before the present Hungarian 
legislative, the bilateral parliamentary relations between the 
two countries could be intensified after the new legislative 
assumes duties. 
  Both sides agreed that all possibilities should be used to 
improve Romanian-Hungarian relations, and that keeping up false 
tensions is to the interest of neither party. The president of 
the <ORGANIZATION>Romanian Senate</ORGANIZATION> gave assurances to the Hungarian guests 
that, before its term is over, the Romanian legislative body 
will ratify the Romanian-Hungarian agreement for the mutual 
protection of investments.

  [Text] <LOCATION>Bucharest ROMPRES</LOCATION>, 15/4/1994 -- The main danger 
threatening <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION> is not coming from outside, but rather from 
inside, subversion being one of its forms, <PERSON>Ion Mircea Pascu</PERSON>, 
secretary of state in charge of defense and international 
relations of the <ORGANIZATION>Romanian Ministry of Defense</ORGANIZATION>, told a news 
conference <DATE>Friday, 15 April</DATE>. Subversive acts can be 'canvassed' 
in many ways, he said, by those who pursue such aims. <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION> 
does not exclude extraneous danger, although this is less 
poignant at the moment. He said <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION>'s option is for 
integration in the European structures, and that the Partnership 
for Peace is one step towards that goal. <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION>'s ultimate 
target in its strive for integration is the forging of a 
European security system comprising all the actors on the 
European political stage, the <ORGANIZATION>Russian Federation</ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION>Ukraine</LOCATION>, 
the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>, inclusively. 
  Related to the problems the <ORGANIZATION>Romanian Army</ORGANIZATION> is confronted 
with, 
the secretary of state said its endowment and equipment shall be 
done as the budget allocation permits. Although modest, this 
provides for certain growths which will enable the army to 
upgrade medical assistance and housing conditions for the 
military.

  [Text] <LOCATION>Bucharest ROMPRES</LOCATION>, 16/6/1994 -- For several weeks 
the <ORGANIZATION>Chamber of Deputies</ORGANIZATION> has debated the Education Act, seen as 
the second most important law of this country after the 
Constitution. The law will pass when key provisions, such as the 
ones regulating education in minority languages, are solved. To 
these, the <ORGANIZATION>Democratic Union</ORGANIZATION> of Hungarians in <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION> [<ORGANIZATION>UDMR</ORGANIZATION>] has 
many objections in their draft form. 
  The chapter in question, the thirteenth, being the most 
difficult to adopt, a Parliament member came the other day with 
the idea that the chapter should be skipped over and remanded to 
a special group formed of the senior members of the [<ORGANIZATION>Chamber of 
Deputies] Education Committee</ORGANIZATION> and the leaders of the 
parliamentary groups, while the plenum goes on with the debates 
on the following chapters. 
  So, while the chamber tackled other sections of the draft, 
negotiations took place in what the daily newspaper ADEVARUL 
calls "the less transparent corners of the <ORGANIZATION>Education Committee</ORGANIZATION> 
and the chamber's permanent bureau," and "maybe even between the 
ruling Social Democracy Party of <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION> [<ORGANIZATION>PDSR</ORGANIZATION>] and the <ORGANIZATION>UDMR</ORGANIZATION>." 
  The bone of contention are two articles of this Chapter 13, 
namely the one stipulating that at all school levels the history 
and geography of <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION> should be taught in Romanian language, 
and the other says that objects of study specific for the 
technical, medical, agricultural, juridical, and economic 
streams, whatever the level, should be taught in Romanian. 
According to press news, the ruling party is reportedly 
favoring the provisions above for various reasons, one of them 
being the insistent request by some of its political allies (the 
<ORGANIZATION>National Unity Party</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Greater Romania Party</ORGANIZATION>), and 
some independent members of parliament, namely that "the history 
and geography of <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION> be taught exclusively in the official 
language of the Romanian state," that is, in Romanian. 
  Commenting the first round of talks on this issue, <ORGANIZATION>CRONICA 
ROMANA</ORGANIZATION> remarks that "it ended with an agreement on the teaching 
of geography and civic education in the languages of minorities, 
and of teaching only history in Romanian language." A second 
and a third round of consultations have failed so far to bring 
the sides' positions any nearer. 
  With the consultations going on until late, the following 
morning (<DATE>Thursday</DATE>, 16 <DATE>June</DATE>), the plenum debates started <DATE>two 
hours later</DATE> than scheduled. 
  The same morning, a <ORGANIZATION>UDMR</ORGANIZATION> press release informed that its 
presidium had reached the conclusion, at its latest meeting, 
that the articles so far adopted from the draft of the education 
act "do not help solve the problem to the effect desired by the 
<ORGANIZATION>UDMR</ORGANIZATION>," and that the still valid education law, enacted during 
the communist regime, was "more permissive than the draft 
currently under debate."

  [Text] <LOCATION>Bucharest ROMPRES</LOCATION>, 8/2/1994 -- "An Arbitrary 
Differentiation That Defies Historical Truth" is the title under 
which the editorial of the daily newspaper DIMINEATA comments 
the recent statements made by the president of the Republic of 
<LOCATION>Moldova</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Mircea Snegur</PERSON>, relative to the existence of a "Moldovan 
people," allegedly different from the Romanian people. 
  As is known, the Republic of <LOCATION>Moldova</LOCATION> is inhabited by <PERCENT>64 
percent</PERCENT> ethnic Romanians, speakers of a genuine albeit slightly 
archaic Romanian, and live on more than three quarters of what 
used to be the historical Romanian province of <LOCATION>Bessarabia</LOCATION>, 
annexed in <DATE>1940</DATE> by the former <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> on the strength of 
the Soviet-German pact signed by the then foreign ministers 
Molotov and <PERSON>Ribbentrop</PERSON>. After the fall at the end of the ninth 
decade of the totalitarian regimes in the <LOCATION>East of Europe</LOCATION>, more 
and more voices in the Republic of <LOCATION>Moldova</LOCATION> proclaimed the return 
of this Romanian territory to its mother land <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION>. 
  The editorial quoted above cautions that the reoccurrence in 
<PERSON>Snegur</PERSON>'s declaration of older theses of the Soviet ideology 
periodically aired, first in the twenties and thirties, then in 
the forties and fifties and in the <PERSON>Brezhnev</PERSON> epoch, which 
advocate a clear distinction between the Romanian people and 
culture and the "Moldovan people and culture." 
  TINERETUL LIBER finds <PERSON>Snegur</PERSON>'s attitude as a strategic 
response to <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION>'s offensive attempts to regain its commanding 
role over its former republics, but finds no excuse for his 
impudence of "denying his own roots, and doing this on behalf of 
those he is representing." The newspaper terms <LOCATION>Bucharest</LOCATION>'s 
reaction as "still pale" and warns that Romanian should not 
neglect the national interest and overlook the political 
significance and the emotional impact <PERSON>Snegur</PERSON>'s statement carries. 
  Under the heading "Romanian Political Circles Vehemently 
Condemn <PERSON>Mircea Snegur</PERSON>'s Switch" CURIERUL NATIONAL groups 
opinions by Romanian political forces on <PERSON>Mircea Snegur</PERSON>'s 
statements. "Preposterous" is the label applied to them by 
<ORGANIZATION>Peasant Party</ORGANIZATION> [<ORGANIZATION>PNTCD</ORGANIZATION>] Vice President <PERSON>Ioan Diaconescu</PERSON>. The 
ruling Social Democracy Party of <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION> (<ORGANIZATION>PDSR</ORGANIZATION>) finds them 
"inciting and offending," and <ORGANIZATION>Romanian National Unity Party</ORGANIZATION> 
(<ORGANIZATION>PUNR</ORGANIZATION>) Vice President <PERSON>Cornel Brahas</PERSON> qualifies them as "an overt 
attempt at our integrity, a tragical treason of the Romanian 
kin." 
  COTIDIANUL defines the lines of action against such 
aberrations in the following terms: "The awareness of the 
physical, spiritual and moral geography, the unharnessing of the 
Romanians' power to create, to give vigour and substance to the 
national idea through the opening toward the European spirit 
have become the commandments of our ties against the dangers 
springing from the rebirth of the Zhirinovskiy-type [<PERSON>Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy</PERSON>, leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION>] 
imperial nationalism and expansionism."

  [Text] <LOCATION>Bucharest</LOCATION>, ROMPRES, 6/5/1994 -- "The Partnership for 
Peace has a special significance for <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION>," <PERSON>Gheorghe Tinca</PERSON>, 
Romanian minister of defense states in an interview with the 
periodical PARLAMENTUL. 
  "We were the first to sign the document-framework," he 
recalls, adding that "<LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION>'s adherence to that programme is 
not only a major step, a stage towards the proper guaranteeing 
of national security, but it comes to answer also our 
determination to fully integrate within European and 
Euro-Atlantic structures, an objective fully embraced by all 
political parties represented in <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION>. The 
adherence to the Partnership for Peace programme of all 
<LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION>'s neighboring states and their commitment to observe the 
principles of that programme would be able to provide certain 
indirect guarantees for the consolidation of our national 
security. That is why we have insisted on the fact that the 
Partnership for Peace should be open to all states, for we want 
them to take active part in the process initiated by <ORGANIZATION>NATO</ORGANIZATION>," the 
Romanian minister added. 
  Mentioning that "<LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION> had already set its aims in the 
process of army restructuring, before the initiation of the 
Partnership for Peace programme, whose aims are similar to the 
programme's objectives," <PERSON>Gheorghe Tinca</PERSON> went on to say that "the 
Romanian military doctrine is traditionally a defensive one, 
which matches the partnership's norms, while as regards the 
army's restructuring, training and techniques, all these are to 
face a process of modernization". 
  "We would say that <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION> is viewing the peace partnership 
as an instrument to encourage investments, business, and 
economic development. In fact it is not by mere coincidence 
that simultaneously with the Partnership for Peace much talk is 
done about a Partnership for Prosperity. From the very first 
statements regarding the Partnership for Peace, <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION>'s 
President <PERSON>Ion Iliescu</PERSON> referred to the need for an economic 
partnership, a concept that should be extended not only to the 
European continent but to the entire world," the Romanian 
minister of defense concluded.

<FÊP=106> [From the 15 <DATE>June</DATE> Romanian press review] </F>
  [Excerpts] <LOCATION>Bucharest ROMPRES</LOCATION>, 15/6/1994 -- The need for a 
balance in the Romanian society, marked these days by extensive 
union protests and the celebration of four years since the 
miners' descent to <LOCATION>Bucharest</LOCATION> on 14 <DATE>June</DATE> are the major themes 
covered by the leading press put out on <DATE>Wednesday, 15 June</DATE>. 
  The protest launched at the beginning of this week in 
<LOCATION>Bucharest</LOCATION> by three major trade union blocs, even if ruled by a 
mostly trade-unionist and commemorative character, have turned 
into a protest against the current leadership. 
  Amid street protests, the unilateral initiative of the 
opposition <ORGANIZATION>National Peasant Christian-Democratic Party</ORGANIZATION> [PNTCD] 
to launch procedures to suspend <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION>'s President <PERSON>Ion Iliescu</PERSON> 
from his office is one more element to fuel tension in the 
political life, according to the press put out today. 
  Daily <ORGANIZATION>CURIERUL NATIONAL</ORGANIZATION> considers that the <ORGANIZATION>PNTCD</ORGANIZATION>'s 
initiative 
is not only "a political lesson," but also and especially "a 
lesson of inflexibility and radicalism." The daily remarks that 
the history of the past four years shows, among other things, 
that radicalism and inflexibility "have had no political impact 
on the electorate, but rather on the contrary." Examining the 
potential consequences of the <ORGANIZATION>PNTCD</ORGANIZATION>'s initiative, the cited 
daily estimates that by this "a definite end was put to the 
opposition--leadership dialogue," as it "encouraged the 
conservatory group within the ruling party of Social Democracy 
Party of <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION> [<ORGANIZATION>PDSR</ORGANIZATION>] to assert that the opposition is an 
enemy to fight with" and opened prospects for the ruling party 
to consolidate ties with its current allies. Moreover, the 
daily considers that all these would have as potential 
consequence a speedy access of the <ORGANIZATION>National Romanian Unity Party</ORGANIZATION> 
[<ORGANIZATION>PUNR</ORGANIZATION>] to ruling, for under the newly created circumstances, 
this party "seems an ideal partner in governing." 
  Daily DIMINEATA writes that "the initiative launched by 
<ORGANIZATION>PNTCD</ORGANIZATION> 
leader <PERSON>Corneliu Coposu</PERSON> is in fact his own epitaph." The daily 
notes that it is not a serious fact that the <ORGANIZATION>PNTCD</ORGANIZATION> leader 
imagined that he could find two thirds of the parliamentarians 
"to embrace his aberration," and that "by this he sets himself 
in the service of our country's enemies, who are now seeing 
themselves with their lands and enterprises returned as their 
property rights." 
  Several dailies publish and comment on the communique issued 
by <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION>'s presidency in which the accusations brought to 
<LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION>'s number one [President <PERSON>Ion Iliescu</PERSON>] are viewed as 
"ungrounded." [passage omitted] 
  Government daily VOCEA ROMANIEI publishes views of several 
parliamentarians on the initiative launched by the <ORGANIZATION>PNTCD</ORGANIZATION> leader, 
which they view as "a hit below the belt on democracy," an "at 
least hazardous action," or "a bluff." 
  The dailies also inform that at yesterday's meeting of the 
opposition Democratic Convention of <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION> [CDR] leaders and 
leaders of the <ORGANIZATION>Democratic Party</ORGANIZATION> [PD] a conclusion was reached to 
stop the procedure for President Iliescu's suspension from 
office and to invite the president to face <ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION> and 
clarify the disputed aspects. This step is viewed by the 
editorialist of daily CRONICA ROMANA as "wise" or as "the most 
logical and democratic alternative under the given 
circumstances." On the other hand, the opposition is furthering 
its radical efforts on the much disputed issue of the draft bill 
on nationalized houses, daily ADEVARUL informing its readers 
that it is possible for the opposition to totally withdraw from 
<ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION>, according to an announcement made yesterday by 
<PERSON>Gyorgy Frunda</PERSON>, senator of the <ORGANIZATION>Democratic Union</ORGANIZATION> of Hungarians in 
<LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION> [<ORGANIZATION>UDMR</ORGANIZATION>]. 
  Under the headline "Union Protests at European Standards," 
government's daily VOCEA ROMANIEI extensively comments on the 
protests launched yesterday in <LOCATION>Bucharest</LOCATION>. The daily remarks the 
observance of public order, the civilized articulation of the 
various claims, mostly economic ones, and the openness for 
dialogue. Daily <ORGANIZATION>CRONICA ROMANA</ORGANIZATION> welcomes the fact that no 
violence was used by demonstrators yesterday. [passage omitted]

  [Text] <LOCATION>Bucharest ROMPRES</LOCATION>, 23/6/1994 -- The Romanian press 
of the past days comments on the results of an opinion poll 
ordered by the government conducted by the <ORGANIZATION>Romanian Institute of 
Public Opinion Polling</ORGANIZATION> (<ORGANIZATION>IRSOP</ORGANIZATION>) in <DATE>April 1994</DATE>, and the results of 
which, however, being unfavorable for the government, are being 
kept strictly confidential. 
  According to the poll -- which carries the title <ORGANIZATION>National 
Study Regarding Public Perception of Current Social Issues</ORGANIZATION>, the 
<ORGANIZATION>Government</ORGANIZATION>'s Eligibility for the People's Favors, and the 
Popularity of Parties and Their Top Politicians -- two thirds of 
the Romanians are not satisfied with President <PERSON>Ion Iliescu</PERSON>'s 
performance and view him as not eligible for another mandate in 
office. More than <PERCENT>27 percent</PERCENT> are stating in favor of <LOCATION>Ion 
Iliescu</LOCATION>, considering him still eligible for the presidential 
office. 
  Eight out of ten Romanians are reproaching the president 
with 
not doing anything or doing too little to eliminate corruption 
(<PERCENT>83 percent</PERCENT>) and for agriculture (<PERCENT>81 percent</PERCENT>.) Two thirds are 
of the opinion that he does not encourage enough the market 
economy (<PERCENT>67 percent</PERCENT>) and is bringing a far too tiny contribution 
to the speeding up of privatization. Such opinions are, 
however, revealing that one part of the population has a wrong 
perception regarding the responsibilities of the presidential 
office. 
  Eight out of ten Romanians have a negative view on the 
government (<PERCENT>79 percent</PERCENT>). The negative views seem to be grounded 
more on the given impression of the government's lack of 
interest for the population, than on the lack of abilities in 
the performance of the executive. Only one out of four 
Romanians (<PERCENT>23 percent</PERCENT>) is accusing the government of lack of 
competence. With a smaller percentage, namely two out of ten 
Romanians (<PERCENT>21 percent</PERCENT>) are ready to praise the government and to 
find excuses for its failures, invoking an intervention by 
several forces sabotaging their good intentions. 
  The population's confidence in the political parties is 
pictured as follows: The ruling Social Democracy Party of 
<LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION> [<ORGANIZATION>PDSR</ORGANIZATION>] -- <PERCENT>21 percent</PERCENT>; the <ORGANIZATION>National Peasant 
Christian-Democratic Party</ORGANIZATION> [PNTCD] (opposition) -- <PERCENT>17 percent</PERCENT>; 
the Democratic Agrarian Party of <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION> [PDAR] (backer of the 
government until recently) -- <PERCENT>8 percent</PERCENT>; the <ORGANIZATION>Civic Alliance 
Party</ORGANIZATION> [PAC] (opposition) - <PERCENT>8 percent</PERCENT>; the Democratic Party [PD] 
(opposition) -- <PERCENT>6 percent</PERCENT>; the <ORGANIZATION>National Romanian Unity Party</ORGANIZATION> 
[<ORGANIZATION>PUNR</ORGANIZATION>] (government backer) -- <PERCENT>6 percent</PERCENT>; the Romanian Ecologist 
Party [PER] -- <PERCENT>6 percent</PERCENT>; the Liberal Party '93 [PL-93] -- <PERCENT>5 
percent</PERCENT>; the Democratic Union of Hungarians in <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION> [<ORGANIZATION>UDMR</ORGANIZATION>] -- 
<PERCENT>5 percent</PERCENT> (all opposition forces); the <ORGANIZATION>Socialist Party of Labor</ORGANIZATION> 
[PSM] -- <PERCENT>4 percent</PERCENT>; the <ORGANIZATION>Greater Romania Party</ORGANIZATION> [PRM] -- <PERCENT>4 percent</PERCENT> 
(both government backers); and the Romanian Social-Democratic 
Party [PSDR] -- <PERCENT>1 percent</PERCENT> (opposition.) 
  The circumstances under which the poll was leaked to the 
press are still unknown, because its orderer, the <ORGANIZATION>Government</ORGANIZATION>'s 
<ORGANIZATION>General Secretariat</ORGANIZATION>, did not make an official release of the 
document, while the executive has neither denied nor confirmed 
speculations of the press.

   A coach from communist <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION>'s Olympic
team met with immigration officers at a secret location <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>
after appealing for asylum in <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>, an <ORGANIZATION>Immigration Department</ORGANIZATION>
spokesman said.
   ``He's in a secluded place, a safe place with security,''
spokesman <PERSON>Gerry Maffre</PERSON> said in <LOCATION>Ottawa</LOCATION>.
   The coach was not identified, but Olympic sources and Canadian
news media said he was <PERSON>Dumitru Focseneanu</PERSON>, the Romanian bobsled
coach whose team had 27th and 30th place finishes at the <ORGANIZATION>Winter
Olympic Games</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Calgary</LOCATION> <DATE>last week</DATE>.
   ``We're trying to find out what he really wants to do,'' <PERSON>Maffre</PERSON>
said.
   The bobsled coach reportedly refused to board a bus taking the
22-member Romanian team to <LOCATION>Calgary</LOCATION> airport <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> and sought
refugee status.
   The federal <ORGANIZATION>Immigration Department</ORGANIZATION> was handling the case. The
<LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> filed an angry protest over an immigration hotline set
up in <LOCATION>Calgary</LOCATION> to handle emergencies and possible defection cases.
   The Romanian was the only known defector among more than 1,800
Olympic athletes and 1,000 coaches and officials from 57 countries.
But three Romanian speed skaters and their coach left <LOCATION>Calgary</LOCATION>
abruptly the day before the Games began amid speculation the
athletes planned to defect.
   City Police Superintendent <PERSON>Len Esler</PERSON> said the defector
approached two police officers at the athletes' village at the
<ORGANIZATION>University of Calgary</ORGANIZATION> about <TIME>9:30 p.m.</TIME> <DATE>Monday</DATE> and ``requested
political asylum.''
   <PERSON>Esler</PERSON> said the man was taken to a police station where
immigration officers picked him up. He refused to give the man's
name ``for his safety and the safety of his family.''
   Focseneanu was in <LOCATION>Calgary</LOCATION> <DATE>last December</DATE> during a bobsled World
Cup competition.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Romanian Embassy</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Ottawa</LOCATION> refused to comment.
   <PERSON>Wilf Lindner</PERSON>, manager of the <LOCATION>Calgary</LOCATION> immigration center, said
the man would be allowed to stay only after a medical examination,
a security check into his background and an <ORGANIZATION>Immigration Department</ORGANIZATION>
hearing.
   ``All decisions are made on a case-to-case basis,'' he said.

  [Text] <LOCATION>Bucharest</LOCATION>, ROMPRES, 10/5/1994 -- Romanian Minister 
of State <PERSON>Mircea Cosea</PERSON> appreciated as a success the stabilization 
of the leu exchange rate reached in <DATE>April</DATE> as much valuable as it 
had been achieved without "traumas or big commotions." In an 
interview with the <ORGANIZATION>Romania Radio</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Vacaroiu</PERSON> cabinet's reform 
minister <PERSON>Mircea Cosea</PERSON> said the stabilization process would 
continue till <DATE>June</DATE>, the current year, when the inter-bank market 
is scheduled to be established. Cosea opined the success 
belonged to a fruitful cooperation between <ORGANIZATION>Government</ORGANIZATION> and the 
<ORGANIZATION>National Bank of Romania</ORGANIZATION> "extremely well valued abroad" and the 
"final" condition on the <ORGANIZATION>IMF</ORGANIZATION> stand-by loan. 
  Referring to the stage of privatization, <PERSON>Cosea</PERSON> said the 
so-called "<PERCENT>30 percent</PERCENT>" action would be finalized within the 
current month. The action will consist in the population's 
exchanging their property certificates -- previously granted to 
the population -- for shares in the commercial state companies 
amounting up to a total value of <PERCENT>30 percent</PERCENT> of the commercial 
companies' aggregate capital. The <ORGANIZATION>Governmental Council of 
Economic Coordination</ORGANIZATION>, Strategy, and Reform -- headed by <PERSON>Cosea</PERSON> 
-- together with the <ORGANIZATION>National Privatization Agency</ORGANIZATION>, State 
Property Fund, and the (five) Private Property Funds are drawing 
up the details of the stock public offering. 
  <PERSON>Mircea Cosea</PERSON> gave as a proof of the increasing international 
recognition of the economic reform in <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION> the invitation he 
had received in order to open and lead a conference organized by 
the specialized commission of the <LOCATION>European Union</LOCATION> for issues 
concerning the small and middle-sized enterprises.

  [Text] <LOCATION>Bucharest</LOCATION>, ROMPRES, 6/04/1994 -- "<LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION> has the 
capacity to employ its own potential," said Romanian minister of 
state, head of the <ORGANIZATION>Council of Economic Coordination</ORGANIZATION>, Strategy 
and Reform, in an interview granted to the governmental daily 
VOCEA ROMANIEI. 
  "The market economy is not a goal, an objective," says 
<PERSON>Cosea</PERSON>, 
but it must be considered as "a way to organize production and 
consumption based on relations of equivalent exchanges." 
Minister <PERSON>Cosea</PERSON> opined that <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION> should consider the projects 
for the future according to the objectives it wish to reach. 
The development, as a goal, "depends on a country's capacity of 
employing the potential it has and, in this respect, few 
countries have this capacity that <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION> has." 
  Minister <PERSON>Cosea</PERSON> said also that the reform in <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION> was "an 
action of updating and civilizing which entails time and 
efforts. Still, the reform must be, in the end, visible and 
perceptible at the level of the individual" and not reduced to 
some statistical figures with regard to the pace of the 
privatization. "If it does not bring a change in the life of the 
individual, in his life in the society, the reform has no 
motivation." Reviewing the past four years of reform, <PERSON>Mircea 
Cosea</PERSON> concluded that the single change in the life of the 
individual was only a "permanent stress caused by the vanishing 
of the old values." 
  The reform, <PERSON>Cosea</PERSON> opined, should lead to the healing of the 
Romanian individual from two maladies he suffered from very much 
in the communist regime, namely, "the apathy, lack of 
determination," and "a certain underestimation of the country 
and of the people he belongs to in favor of foreign values, 
usually Western ones." <PERSON>Mircea Cosea</PERSON> said that at the time being 
<LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION> needed "a well structured system of values" and "a 
revigoration of the real, genuine patriotism which means one's 
faith that he belong to a valuable and strong nation." These can 
be achieved, <PERSON>Cosea</PERSON> considers, through the economic factor. When 
the Romanians would be able to live a better life, they will 
abandon the tendency of over-estimating the values of other 
peoples only because of their higher living standard, believes 
<PERSON>Cosea</PERSON>. 
  Referring to the privatization issues of primary concern in 
<DATE>1994</DATE>, <PERSON>Mircea Cosea</PERSON> warned that "privatization is not a reform 
element in itself but a single step which must be taken in the 
economic and social field." Minister <PERSON>Cosea</PERSON> said also that 
because of the way privatization has been made from <DATE>1990</DATE> till 
now, it is no longer perceived by the public as a reform element 
but as "a collective trauma." In this respect, <PERSON>Cosea</PERSON> mentioned 
certain abuses, elements of corruption, in the first years of 
the privatization process.

  [Text] <LOCATION>Bucharest ROMPRES</LOCATION>, 10/5/1994 -- In the evening of 
10 <DATE>May</DATE> President <PERSON>Ion Iliescu</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION> offered an official 
dinner in honor of Albanian President <PERSON>Sali Berisha</PERSON> and of the 
delegation that accompanied him on his visit to <LOCATION>Bucharest</LOCATION>. On 
this occasion Presidents <PERSON>Ion Iliescu</PERSON> and <PERSON>Sali Berisha</PERSON> held 
toasts. 
  In his toast, the head of the Romanian state said that 
"after 
the instatement of democratic regimes in our countries, 
favorable conditions were put in place for the Romanian-Albanian 
relations." In his opinion, the political treaty and the other 
cooperation documents to be signed during the Albanian 
president's visit express the political will of the sides for a 
fruitful long-term cooperation. 
  Mentioning <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Albania</LOCATION>'s concern about the conflict 
tearing apart the former Yugoslav space, the head of the 
Romanian state said: "It is sad that momentary circumstances, 
generated by the dismemberment of former <LOCATION>Yugoslavia</LOCATION>, that 
certain resentments, some of them probably motivated, should lie 
at the root of a tragedy and be now the greatest hurdle in the 
way of a political settlement in the area." The Romanian 
president underlined that <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION> pronounces for a rational and 
responsible attitude on the part of all the leading factors in 
the area so that confrontation is renounced. President <PERSON>Iliescu</PERSON> 
pleaded for further support to the efforts of the international 
community in achieving peace. "The alternative to peace, to 
dialogue is cannot be but the extension of the conflict with 
enormous suffering for the peoples of former <LOCATION>Yugoslavia</LOCATION> and the 
risk of involving other states," the president of <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION> said, 
who also reiterated <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION>'s "firm support for the actions 
directed towards finding a political solution, for the 
reinstatement of trust and understanding." "We wish to give the 
Romanian-Albanian relations a new impetus, to act in such a way 
as to forge exemplary economic, political, cultural, and 
spiritual ties between our peoples," the president of <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION> 
also said.

  [Text] <LOCATION>Bucharest ROMPRES</LOCATION>, 25/2/1994 -- "Any government in 
<LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION> must be a government for reform, and this necessarily 
implies a wide political and social support," President <PERSON>Ion 
Iliescu</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION> told the daily newspaper ADEVARUL. Asked 
whether he had any preferences for the government to be 
appointed after 1 <DATE>March</DATE>, the president of <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION> said that he, 
personally, had no preference, and that he would like "a 
government enjoying some stability and enough parliamentary 
support." He underlined the distinction that should be made 
between "a political agreement between the political parties 
forming the parliament" and the "possible structure of a 
government." In this latter case a government, the president 
opined, "could be formed solely of technocrats or of 
representatives of a single political party, but only based on a 
political formula of a wider parliamentary support." 
  About the much vented version of holding early elections, 
<LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION>'s number one said that such an alternative would not be 
the best for <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION>, because an election campaign at the moment 
would only "disturb public life." However, theoretically 
speaking, early elections "could be a solution unless others are 
found." President <PERSON>Iliescu</PERSON>'s opinion is that in <DATE>1994</DATE> the 
Romanian society should concentrate its efforts on surmounting 
the crisis and on economic reconstruction. "No matter what 
governments will succeed one another, <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION>'s problems will be 
the same," the president of <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION> said. 
  As already widely reflected by the press, President <PERSON>Ion 
Iliescu</PERSON> had consultations with all the parliamentary parties 
with the aim of reaching a political pact aimed at reinstating a 
climate for dialogue between the political forces and at 
building a minimal common platform for taking the economic 
reform further. The first round of consultations ended in 
mid-January. Their resumption depends on the joint agreement of 
all parties involved.

Minister <PERSON>Melescanu</PERSON> underlined that <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION> committed itself with 
all faith and responsibility to the new relation with <ORGANIZATION>NATO</ORGANIZATION> and

  [Text] <LOCATION>Bucharest ROMPRES</LOCATION>, 12/1/1994 -- Referring to the 
steps taken by the county council chairmen of <ORGANIZATION>Satu Mare</ORGANIZATION> and 
<ORGANIZATION>Maramures Counties</ORGANIZATION> for adhesion to the Euro-Carpathian Region 
and to <LOCATION>Ukraine</LOCATION>'s initiative to include the Romanian counties of 
<LOCATION>Botosani</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Suceava</LOCATION> in the same organization, <ORGANIZATION>Romanian Foreign 
Ministry</ORGANIZATION> Spokesman <PERSON>Mircea Geoana</PERSON> emphasized the following things 
at the news briefing of <DATE>January 12</DATE>: 
  "In the first case, the issue has two aspects: A legal and a 
political one. As concerns the legal aspect, the things are 
clear: The two chairmen of county councils were not empowered to 
sign a possible adhesion. As for the political aspect 
concerning the future of <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, the enhancement of integration 
and stability on the continent and in our region, this kind of 
cooperation at the level of localities or territorial 
administrative units is a viable formula. The problem consists 
only of the manner of delimitation of the area in which this 
organization is functioning. We want to be sure that such steps 
do not conceal also things contrary to the European 
organizations' generous and noble purpose of securing the 
states' cooperation and prosperity. <LOCATION>Ukraine</LOCATION>'s efforts to 
include in the Euro-Carpathian Region two counties of <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION> -- 
<LOCATION>Botosani</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Suceava</LOCATION> --, where the numbers of the Ukrainian 
minority are rather inconsequential, means a stand taken by the 
<ORGANIZATION>Ukrainian Government</ORGANIZATION> precisely on this preoccupation of ours. 
The possibility of <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION>'s participation in the 
Euro-Carpathian Region or in other forms of similar cooperation 
has been under the foreign ministry's consideration," spokesman 
<PERSON>Mircea Geoana</PERSON> said.

  [Text] <LOCATION>Bucharest</LOCATION>, ROMPRES, 19/1/1994 -- "The problem of 
Romanians in other countries, including the Romanians living in 
<LOCATION>Ukraine</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Hungary</LOCATION>, is of concern to the <ORGANIZATION>Romanian Foreign 
Ministry</ORGANIZATION> and it can be settled only in the natural framework of 
human rights, starting from the generally acknowledged measures 
elaborated within the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION>, CSCE and the Council of 
<LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>", said Romanian Foreign Minister <PERSON>Teodor Melescanu</PERSON> in an 
interview with daily JURNAL NATIONAL. "The Romanian state 
campaigns for the strict observance of the norms of 
international law and of the international standards regarding 
the minorities and makes every effort to secure the rights of 
national minorities in <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION>." Teodor Melescanu mentioned 
that "as seen by the <ORGANIZATION>Romanian Foreign Ministry</ORGANIZATION>, the principle of 
truthfulness and respect of the Romanians living abroad to the 
states whose citizens they are make the keystone of our policy 
with the communities of Romanians everywhere and the way to 
follow in order to avoid any tension and disagreement in 
bilateral relations with other countries". 
  As regards <LOCATION>Ukraine</LOCATION>, the Romanian chief diplomat opined that 
"the emotional side and the sensitiveness of the situation of 
the Romanian population in that neighbor country consequent to 
the tragic events generated by the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact 
(<DATE>1939</DATE>), necessarily require the further taking of steps apt to 
secure conditions for the preservation, expression and 
development of national, linguistic, cultural and religious 
identity of the Romanians". In this respect, <PERSON>Melescanu</PERSON> 
stressed: "We assess as necessary the improvement and 
development of the tuition in Romanian existing in that country, 
the provision of facilities for the training in <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION> of 
teaching staff and experts from among Romanian ethnics, the 
granting of assistance in setting up libraries, clubs, 
publishing houses, printing houses for Romanian- language 
publications, the redemption of buildings that belonged to 
Romanian spirituality, the securing of free flow of persons, 
especially for the youth who want to learn in <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION>. I cannot 
watch indifferently the degradation or destruction of Romanian 
vestiges and historical monuments in <LOCATION>Ukraine</LOCATION>'s territory and the 
measures that prevent the free expression of the Romanians' 
opinions, as is the case of the PLAI ROMANESC [ROMANIAN LAND] 
newspaper", said <PERSON>Teodor Melescanu</PERSON>. He stressed that "the 
problems of the situation of Romanians in <LOCATION>Ukraine</LOCATION> and of 
Ukrainians in <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION> are a matter of official talks at the 
level of the two Foreign Ministries pursuing the signing of 
official documents". 
  The territories in today's <LOCATION>Ukraine</LOCATION> inhabited by Romanians 
are 
parts of <LOCATION>Bessarabia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Bucovina</LOCATION> -- ancient Romanian territories 
-- annexed by the former <ORGANIZATION>USSR</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1940</DATE> pursuant to the 
<PERSON>Ribbentrop</PERSON>- Molotov pact which has been disavowed these last few 
years.

  [Text] <LOCATION>Bucharest ROMPRES</LOCATION>, 4/5/1994 -- <PERSON>Radu Campeanu</PERSON> has 
been acknowledged as legitimate president of the <ORGANIZATION>National 
Liberal Party</ORGANIZATION> (PNL) by virtue of a court sentence passed 
yesterday, 3 <DATE>May</DATE>, by the <ORGANIZATION>Bucharest Municipal Court</ORGANIZATION>, which ruled 
against a similar claim by the group led by <PERSON>Mircea 
Ionescu-Quintus</PERSON>. 
  The conflict between the two factions of the <ORGANIZATION>PNL</ORGANIZATION>, generated 
by the wish to reign supreme in the liberal movement, opposes 
<PERSON>Radu Campeanu</PERSON>, liberal member in the <DATE>1940</DATE>'s, repatriated in <DATE>1990</DATE> 
after years of residence in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, who held the <ORGANIZATION>PNL</ORGANIZATION> 
chairmanship over 1990-1993, and ran for the presidency of 
<LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION> in <DATE>1990</DATE>, to <PERSON>Mircea Ionescu-Quintus</PERSON>, lawyer and writer, 
liberal minister of justice in <PERSON>Mr. Theodor Stolojan</PERSON>'s cabinet, 
1991-1992. 
  The conflict and tensions between these two factions and 
between them and other liberal splinter groups have inflicted, 
commentators observe, a negative image on <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION>'s main liberal 
party, which the <DATE>1990</DATE> elections had earned an important number 
of seats in the Parliament that functioned until the next 
elections of <DATE>1992</DATE> when it failed to gain the minimal share of 
votes for parliamentary representation. At that time, liberal 
leaders blamed the failure on <ORGANIZATION>Radu Campeanu</ORGANIZATION>'s strong ego, who on 
the one hand decided to withdraw from the principal opposition 
bloc known as the Democratic Convention of <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION> (CDR) and on 
the other blundered tragically proposing the former sovereign of 
<LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION>, Mihai I, who abdicated in <DATE>1947</DATE>, as candidate for 
presidency, both moves meeting popular disagreement. 
  Starting from <DATE>February 1994</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>PNL</ORGANIZATION> has had a bi-cephalous 
leadership, one being <PERSON>Mircea Ionescu-Quintus</PERSON>, elected PNL 
president in <DATE>1993</DATE>, and the other <PERSON>Radu Campeanu</PERSON>, whom the 
"Campeanu" grouping designated as president of the <ORGANIZATION>National 
Liberal Party</ORGANIZATION> at an extraordinary congress. After this the 
story started of what the press called "the fight for the 
party's stamp" and the fight for the <LOCATION>Bucharest</LOCATION> central seat of 
the party, until the sides turned to the law for a verdict. 
  The resolution made yesterday by the <ORGANIZATION>Bucharest Municipal 
Court</ORGANIZATION> is practically the rejection of a contention lodged by the 
<ORGANIZATION>Quintus</ORGANIZATION> wing against a previous resolution. <PERSON>Mr. Quintus</PERSON>'s group 
announced last evening that they would not abandon legal actions 
until the situation of the <ORGANIZATION>PNL</ORGANIZATION> was clarified and intimated that 
many <ORGANIZATION>PNL</ORGANIZATION> branches had extended them their support.

  [Text] <LOCATION>Bucharest ROMPRES</LOCATION>, 20/4/1994 -- "<LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION>'s 
integration in the European political, economic, and military 
structures is one of the main directions of the Romanian foreign 
policy. Its essence lies in a process of modernization devised 
to include the army too, so that this could become a modern 
army," <ORGANIZATION>National Defense</ORGANIZATION> Minister <PERSON>Gheorghe Tinca</PERSON> told a ROMPRES 
correspondent. This line of policy finds its reflection in the 
principles of military diplomacy, which mirror the efforts to 
develop bilateral relations with the armies of other states. 
Very soon, the Romanian minister said, he will be on a visit to 
<LOCATION>Great Britain</LOCATION>, and arrangements are being made for similar tours 
to the <LOCATION>U.S.A.</LOCATION>, probably in <DATE>July</DATE>, and to <LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION>. There are also 
invitations to <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Albania</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Qatar</LOCATION>, and other 
countries. He mentioned also the neighboring countries with 
which "<LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION> has lately concluded a well defined chapter," the 
Romanian minister said. 
  Another dimension of the Romanian military diplomacy is the 
Partnership for Peace, meant to consolidate stability in our 
region, and wider yet, in the European region. 
  "Whenever we speak of integration, we must also specify what 
we want to integrate into, and that is in the partnership with 
<ORGANIZATION>NATO</ORGANIZATION>, an alliance which, after the cessation of the cold war, 
proved viable and apt to ensure a climate of security." 
  In the opinion of the Romanian defense minister, "the North- 
<LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> alliance should undergo certain changes, now that the 
other pole of rivalry has ceased to exist, and find itself a new 
logic, the logic of collective gain. Confrontation will have to 
be replaced with something else, perhaps with cooperation." 
  While pleading for a partnership formula open to all states 
and stressing the idea of equal security for all European states 
and of sovereignty and independence of their decisions for all 
the countries included in the partnership program, the Romanian 
minister said that such a formula could contribute to defining a 
system of general security, which, based on what already forms 
the skeleton of <ORGANIZATION>NATO</ORGANIZATION>, could "form the necessary security 
umbrella apt to encourage a course to prosperity in this part of 
<LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, too," Defense Minister <PERSON>Gheorghe Tinca</PERSON> said.

  [Text] <LOCATION>Bucharest</LOCATION>, ROMPRES, 12/04/1994 -- The leaders of 
the Liberal Party '93 (PL '93) have made their intention known 
to the press by issuing an "Appeal to All Romanians for 
Conciliation and <LOCATION>Concord</LOCATION>," which also runs as an "invitation" 
extended to the former sovereign of <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Mihai</PERSON> I. The 
appeal is signed by 84 members of parliament representing PL 
<DATE>'93</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>Peasant Party</ORGANIZATION> (PNTCD), the Civic Alliance Party (PAC), 
the Hungarians' Union (<ORGANIZATION>UDMR</ORGANIZATION>), the Social Democrats (PSDR), the 
Democrats (PD-FSN), and two independent parliamentarians. It 
shows that on the religious holiday of Easter (Orthodox, 1 May) 
"King Mihai of <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION> must be together with all Romanians, in 
the ancestral land, as a citizen of this country, observant of 
its constitutional order." 
  The former sovereign expressed his wish to celebrate Easter 
in <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION>, at <LOCATION>Timisoara</LOCATION>.

  [Text] <LOCATION>Bucharest ROMPRES</LOCATION>, 7/1/1994 -- "Before the high 
level meeting of the <ORGANIZATION>NATO</ORGANIZATION> countries scheduled for 10 <DATE>January 
1994</DATE>, I should like to reassert <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION>'s position on the 
alliance and reconfirm the constant interest of my country to 
become a full member of the organization. I have expressed this 
interest on various occasions, including in the letter I 
addressed on 18 <DATE>September 1993</DATE> to the <ORGANIZATION>NATO General Secretariat</ORGANIZATION>, 
to <PERSON>Mr. Manfred Woerner</PERSON>. 
  "<LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION> considers the <ORGANIZATION>North Atlantic Alliance</ORGANIZATION>, that has 
proved its ability to adjust to the new realities emerged after 
the close of the Cold War, as being the only organization apt to 
ensure stability on the European continent and guarantee the 
values of democracy and the state of law. 
  "I have received with special interest the `Partnership for 
Peace' proposal, perceived in <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION> as being an important 
preliminary stage in the process of the country's full 
integration into the <ORGANIZATION>NATO</ORGANIZATION> structures. My country has shown 
willing to participate in this new form of cooperation, with 
respect of the requirements imposed by the status of member of 
the alliance. 
  "I would like to use this occasion to reassert <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION>'s 
strong conviction that, as an European state, it has a rightful 
place into <ORGANIZATION>NATO</ORGANIZATION>. 
  "In analyzing our request, please take into account 
<LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION>'s 
vital interests of security, that have been given new dimensions 
following the recent political developments in the areas in the 
proximity of my country. 
  "Moreover, <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION> is resolute to get more actively involved 
in ensuring stability in the region and in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> in general, it 
is willing to assume all responsibilities it would have as a 
member of the alliance. 
  "I am sure that <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION>'s integration into <ORGANIZATION>NATO</ORGANIZATION> would offer 
us security guarantees absolutely necessary to create conditions 
adequate for translation into practice the democratic 
transformations and the economic reform <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION> has firmly 
committed to. 
  "In my outlook, to be a member of <ORGANIZATION>NATO</ORGANIZATION> is an essential 
constituent of the global process of integration of <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION> in 
Euro-Atlantic structures (<ORGANIZATION>NATO</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>WEU</ORGANIZATION> [Western European Union], 
the <LOCATION>European Union</LOCATION>, and the Council of <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>), this is the 
essential objective of the Romanian foreign policy. 
  "I hope that during the debates to be held at the high level 
meeting in <LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION> you will consider the position of my 
country, on which all political parties in <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION>, 
the whole Romanian people, have agreed."

  [Text] <LOCATION>Bucharest ROMPRES</LOCATION>, 8/4/1994 -- After significant 
contacts with Romanian officials and a concert at <ORGANIZATION>Radio Hall</ORGANIZATION> 
conducted by Belgian Foreign Minister <PERSON>Willy Claes</PERSON>, the chief 
diplomat was received by Romanian president <PERSON>Ion Iliescu</PERSON> on 8 
<DATE>April</DATE> at the <ORGANIZATION>Cotroceni Palace</ORGANIZATION>. 
  Summing up his discussion with the Romanian head of state 
and 
other officials, <PERSON>Willy Claes</PERSON> said that the political statement 
he signed in <LOCATION>Bucharest</LOCATION> offered a framework "comprehensive 
enough" to allow for the development of relations, especially 
legal and economic. The Belgian foreign minister said that when 
there are sufficient guarantees of stability in <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION>, Belgian 
investors would not hesitate to do business in <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION>. 
  The same day, the Belgian foreign minister had an interview 
with <ORGANIZATION>Chamber of Deputies Speaker Adrian Nastase</ORGANIZATION>, during which he 
said <LOCATION>Western Europe</LOCATION> did not intend to treat countries in Central 
and <LOCATION>Eastern Europe</LOCATION> differently than any others. 
  Minister <PERSON>Willy Claes</PERSON> had to cut his Romanian visit short 
because of recent events in <LOCATION>Rwanda</LOCATION> which cost the lives of 
several Belgian UN officers stationed in that country. He left 
<LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION> in the afternoon of <DATE>April 8</DATE>.
