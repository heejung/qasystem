<HEAD>1989 A Record Year For Manatee Deaths</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A record number of manatees, 160,
died in <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> waters in <DATE>1989</DATE>, and state biologists fear recent
cold weather will kill more of the lumbering marine mammals.
   ``We're quite worried about the increasing number of deaths,''
said <PERSON>Bruce Ackerman</PERSON>, a researcher with the <ORGANIZATION>Department of Natural
Resources</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>St. Petersburg</LOCATION>.
   Biologists estimate at least 1,200 manatees, an endangered
species, live in <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>. The population had been estimated at as
many as 10,000 a few decades ago.
   In <DATE>1989</DATE>, 51 manatees died after hitting boats or barges, and
five were killed by other human-caused problems, such as
entanglement in fishing nets, according to the <ORGANIZATION>Department of
Natural Resources</ORGANIZATION>.
   In <DATE>1988</DATE>, 133 manatees were found dead in <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>. Boats killed
43 manatees, then a record.
   Environmentalists and government biologists cite these
statistics when they promote boating speed limits and increased
protection of manatee habitat, issues state lawmakers could debate
this <DATE>spring</DATE>.
   Manatees frequent rivers, estuaries, canals and protected
coastal areas that also are magnets for the state's more than
710,000 registered motor boats.
   The average adult manatee is about 10 feet long and weighs 1,000
pounds, though some weigh three times that much. Gray and
slow-moving, they can be difficult for speedy boaters to spot, said
<PERSON>Lori Price</PERSON>, captive marine mammal specialist for the <ORGANIZATION>Department of
Natural Resources</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``I think very few of them (boaters) actually maliciously intend
to run down a manatee,'' she said. ``They're very difficult to
see.''

   A groggy volunteer crew of five gathered early New
Year's Day and raced to where a 500-pound sea cow had been found
with deep gashes from a boat propeller in its grayish-brown,
leathery back.
   But the West Indian manatee wasn't injured in the congested
Intracoastal Waterway, it was the <LOCATION>Everglades</LOCATION>. ``It shows you they
aren't safe anywhere,'' said <PERSON>Dr. Gregory Bossart</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Miami Seaquarium</LOCATION>
veterinarian and pathologist.
   Besides the unmistakable prop marks, the manatee had three
fractured ribs and a punctured lung. The injuries caused a bubble to
form inside the animal, leaving it floating helplessly.
   The manatee _ dubbed <ORGANIZATION>Marjory</ORGANIZATION> after <PERSON>Marjory Stoneman Douglas</PERSON>, a
protector of the Everglads _ has been recovering at the <LOCATION>Seaquarium</LOCATION>,
one of two marine parks _the other is Sea World in <LOCATION>Orlando</LOCATION> _ in
<LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> that are authorized to rescue the protected animal.
   An estimated 1,200 of the prehistoric-looking creatures live in
<LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, based on aerial surveys. The docile, plant-eating
creatures, weighing more than 3,000 pounds and ranging from eight to
14 feet long, are found from northern <LOCATION>South America</LOCATION> to as far north
<LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION>.
   They face a growing threat from <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>'s development boom.
   A total of 133 manatee deaths were reported last year, including
a record 43 from being hit by boats; there were 39 boat-related
deaths in <DATE>1987</DATE>. The 45 deaths so far this year exceeds the <DATE>1987</DATE>
period. Through <DATE>March</DATE>, 15 deaths have been blamed on boats, and 23
carcasses were recovered last month alone.
   ``Our guess is that the numbers increased through the <DATE>'60s</DATE> and
<DATE>'70s</DATE> as there was more protection, but in the '80s they've held
about steady,'' said <PERSON>Dr. Bruce Ackerman</PERSON>, a state marine mammal
researcher. ``If that's the case, the fact that deaths are
increasing is of considerable concern.''
   Even if boat-related deaths were reduced, the manatee faces other
obstacles such as a low reproductive rate and diminishing habitat,
officials say.
   ``We're not that optimistic. ... Their ability to recover from
any kind of problem is limited, even if everything was perfect,''
<PERSON>Ackerman</PERSON> said.
   The rehabilitation of injured manatees is a painstaking process
that takes months. There is also the question of what awaits them
and babies born in captivity once they are returned to the wild.
   ``There's no problem with breeding in the wild. The problem we
have is habitat destruction,'' said <PERSON>J.P. Garner</PERSON>, assistant manager
of <LOCATION>Homosassa Springs Park</LOCATION>, where nine manatees are kept.
   Manatees rely on seagrass beds for food and have begun to
congregate around the warm-water discharges of power plants, where
boat traffic is often heavy.
   <PERSON>Patrick Rose</PERSON>, a marine mammal coordinator for the state
<ORGANIZATION>Department of Natural Resources</ORGANIZATION>, said <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> is focusing efforts on
tying manatee protection to county growth management plans. In
addition, there has been an extensive campaign to increase public
awareness about the creatures' plight.
   Singer-songwriter Jimmy Buffet gave a big boost to the manatee
cause eight years ago when he became chairman of the ``Save the
<ORGANIZATION>Manatee Club</ORGANIZATION>,'' which now boasts an international membership of
about 22,000.
   ``They have absolutely no ability to be aggressive,'' said Rose.
``People identify with them as the ultimate victim.''
   More than five months after being picked up, <ORGANIZATION>Marjory</ORGANIZATION> remains in
guarded but stable condition in a <LOCATION>Seaquarium</LOCATION> tank, <PERSON>Bossart</PERSON> said.
``She's feeling a lot better and is able to dive better.''
   Unlike many others of the gentle mammals, she still has a
fighting chance.

<TEXT>
   The <DATE>1980s</DATE> ended as a disaster for the West Indian
manatee.
   A record 174 of the huge, endangered mammals were found dead in
the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> <DATE>last year</DATE>, primarily because they were struck by
boats and barges in <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> waters, according to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Fish and
<ORGANIZATION>Wildlife Service</ORGANIZATION>'s regional office in <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>.
   So far, <DATE>1990</DATE> is even worse for the sea cows.
   A record 74 manatee deaths were reported in <DATE>January</DATE> alone, most
of that due to the ``Christmas freeze'' that sent temperatures
plunging in <LOCATION>north Florida</LOCATION>.
   The service has been studying manatee deaths since <DATE>1974</DATE>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>FWS</ORGANIZATION> said there were 510 deaths in those 15 years for which a
cause could be found. Of that number, 418 were attributed to the
animals being struck by boats or barges. Seventy-eight died when
they were crushed or drowned in floodgates of locks in canals and
50 were killed by humans. Some were shot, others caught in fishing
nets or lines.
   The population was estimated at 1,000 animals in <DATE>1980</DATE>, and
aerial surveys of warm-water refuges in <DATE>December</DATE> found 1,200
individuals.
   The manatee has been around for 60 million years, evolving from
four-footed animals about the time the dinosaurs were on their last
legs.
   Because of the deaths in <DATE>1989</DATE>, the state of <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> proposed
stringent new measures to help protect them.
   The measures include establishment of manatee protection plans
in those <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> counties that had the highest rates of
boat-manatee collisions last year. They also call for creation of
new manatee protection zones, where boats may travel only at
reduced speeds to help prevent collisions, and controlling
expansion of new boating facilities in areas inhabited by manatees.
   The state also is planning stepped up enforcement of all laws to
protect the species.
   The big, slow moving animals simply can't get out of the way of
fast boats. The animals, which can reach a length in excess of 10
feet and a weight of more than 1,000 pounds, lounge in rivers and
canals feeding on plants.
   Although they do move out into salt water, they spend most of
their lives in fresh water.
   They winter in warm water areas, such as springs, and have found
new habitat in the warm-water discharges of power plants as far
north as south <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Crystal River National Wildlife Refuge</ORGANIZATION> on <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Gulf Coast</ORGANIZATION>
was established as a haven for manatees. <ORGANIZATION>Merritt Island National
Wildlife Refuge</ORGANIZATION> on the <LOCATION>Atlantic Coast</LOCATION> also has areas closed for
manatee protection.

<HEAD>Battle Lines Drawn in Florida Over Proposed Speed, Boating Rules</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RON WORD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Boating in <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> has never been more
popular _ or more deadly _ as boats race at speeds up to 100 mph in
crowded waterways, threatening other boaters and wildlife like the
manatee.
   Now the state that has led the nation in recreational boating
deaths for the past two years is trying to establish a boating
speed limit, require more education and charge higher license fees
to bring the boating explosion under control.
   There are some 700,000 boat owners in the state _ seven times
the number of registered boaters in <DATE>1961</DATE>. And that figure is
expected to double in the next 10 years, according to <ORGANIZATION>Florida
Marine Patrol</ORGANIZATION> estimates. Many boaters strongly oppose any new
regulations.
   The boating fatality rate in <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> is 2{ times the national
average, with the number of deaths soaring from 40 in <DATE>1986</DATE> to 102
in <DATE>1987</DATE> and 105 last year.
   The recent outcry for greater regulation was sparked by a
Memorial Day weekend collision along the Intercoastal Waterway in
<LOCATION>Pinellas County</LOCATION> that killed four teen-agers.
   Dr. <PERSON>William LaTorre</PERSON>, 48, was arrested <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> and charged with
four counts of manslaughter by culpable negligence after his sleek
35-foot boat collided with a 17-foot boat carrying five teen-agers
on the state's west coast near <LOCATION>St. Petersburg</LOCATION>.
   This week, the heads of state agencies will hold public hearings
in <LOCATION>Orlando</LOCATION> on a proposal by the <ORGANIZATION>Department of Natural Resources</ORGANIZATION> to
set a statewide speed limit of 30 mph, and 20 mph in 12 counties
heavily populated by manatees. The proposed speed limits are
scheduled to be voted on at a <DATE>Sept. 14</DATE> Cabinet meeting.
   ``I think there's not a lot of sentiment right now for a
statewide (speed) zone,'' said <PERSON>Sally Munroe</PERSON>, an aide to Gov. <PERSON>Bob
Martinez</PERSON>.
   <PERSON>Marjorie Lamphear</PERSON>, education director of Save the <ORGANIZATION>Manatee Club</ORGANIZATION>
in <LOCATION>Maitland</LOCATION>, says the lower speed limits proposed for the 12
counties could help the manatee _ a large sea mammal also known as
sea cows.
   ``Manatees do recognize danger and try to get out of the way,''
she said. ``But between a speeding boat and a slow manatee, the
combination is not in favor of the manatee.''
   Between <DATE>January</DATE> and <DATE>July</DATE>, 103 manatees have been found dead,
with 37 deaths attributed to vessels, according the natural
resources department. During the same period last year, 29 of 93
manatee deaths were blamed on boaters. An estimated 1,200 of the
docile, plant-eating creatures, weighing more than 3,000 pounds and
ranging from eight to 14 feet long, live in <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>.
   ``We could lose 150 this year,'' <PERSON>Ms. Lamphear</PERSON> said. ``We need to
take drastic measures.''
   Next month, the natural resources department will ask the
governor and his Cabinet for mandatory education for boaters and
higher license fees to help pay for better enforcement of boating
laws, according to a draft report released last week by the agency.
   Some view the proposed regulations as an unnecessary intrusion.
   Last <DATE>spring</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>Legislature</ORGANIZATION> rejected a boating safety bill that
included a statewide speed limit.
   ``Why the heck should the government be sticking its nose in
something that should be individually involved?'' asked state Rep.
<PERSON>Jim King</PERSON>.
   <PERSON>Jim Robinson</PERSON>, state executive director of the <ORGANIZATION>Marine Industries
Association</ORGANIZATION>, doubts a 30 mph speed limit will lower the number of
deaths.
   Speed isn't the prime factor behind boating deaths, he
contended. They also were caused by lack of life jackets,
overloaded craft, carelessness and bad weather conditions, he said.
   Robinson called the proposed regulations an imposition on the
public, and warned, ``You better believe there's going to be a
battle.''
   But Col. <PERSON>Don Ellingsen</PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION>Florida Marine Patrol</ORGANIZATION>,
said the regulations are needed because of the increasing
congestion on <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> waterways and the increase in speed.
   ``We don't believe that 30 mph will affect the vast majority of
boat owners,'' he said. ``We are trying to slow down the floating
rockets that go 80 to 100 mph.''

   A record 201 manatees died in <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>
waters this year, authorities said.
   At least 46 of the endangered sea cows were found dead in the
weeks following a three-day freeze <DATE>last Christmas</DATE>, and boat
collisions killed at least 46 more, said <PERSON>Bruce Ackerman</PERSON>, a marine
mammal researcher with the state <ORGANIZATION>Department of Natural Resources</ORGANIZATION>.
   A variety of factors contributed to the other deaths.
   Last year, 166 manatees were killed, up from 133 in <DATE>1988</DATE>.
   State officials estimate there are 1,200 to 1,500 West Indian
manatees in <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, down from an estimated 10,000 several decades
ago.
   The manatee has been around for 60 million years, evolving from
four-footed creatures about the time the dinosaurs were on their
last legs. The big, slow sea cows loll in warm, shallow areas in
oceans, rivers and canals to feed on underwater grass. They can be
longer than 10 feet and weigh more than 1,000 pounds and are unable
to avoid fast boats.

<TEXT>
   Scientists, marine enforcement and
<LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> businesses are pulling together to save the manatee from
boaters in a campaign keyed to the mammal's endangered status:
``Miss her now or miss her forever.''
   ``I think the slogan has really got a message,'' <PERSON>Vi Stewart</PERSON> of
the state <ORGANIZATION>Department of Natural Resources</ORGANIZATION> marine research
laboratory said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>. ``It's very significant, but you've got
to think about it. It doesn't jump out and grab you like `where's
the beef?'''
   Marine experts estimate there are probably 1,200 West Indian
manatees left in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, down from as many as an
estimated 10,000 a few decades ago. Almost all are in <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>'s
coastal waters.
   So far this year through <DATE>September</DATE>, 125 have died in <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, 41
after being struck by boats or barges. Last year 113 deaths were
recorded.
   Aiming to slow this record-setting pace, a multimedia
advertising blitz is planned for the time of year when the gentle
giant is most vulnerable to boaters.
   As the temperature drops and the water cools, the lumbering sea
cows move into warmer waters near springs or thermal discharges of
power plants, thus increasing the risk of contact with boaters.
   ``The next six months is the most critical time for the
manatee,'' said <PERSON>Ralph Campbell</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>HLA Advertising and
Public Relations of Tampa</ORGANIZATION>, which donated work on the campaign and
came up with the slogan.
   The state Cabinet is recommending posting speed limits for boats
and the licensing of operators in a two-fold effort to reduce
boat-related deaths and to protect manatees.
   <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> has 711,000 registered boats. The state had 105
boating-related deaths last year.
   Gov. <PERSON>Bob Martinez</PERSON> and the Cabinet also voted <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> to require
13 counties where the manatees are concentrated to decide within 60
days whether to immpose countywide speed limits or adopt more
specific plans.

<TEXT>
   More than half of an unprecedented number of dead
manatees found in <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> waterways during the past nine days may
be victims of the Christmas cold snap, state officials said.
   The carcasses of 41 of the endangered marine mammals have been
discovered in the new year, the state's <ORGANIZATION>Department of Natural
Resources</ORGANIZATION> reported <DATE>Monday</DATE>.
   There were only 15 manatees found dead last year in all of
<DATE>January</DATE>, said <PERSON>Dr. Bruce Ackerman</PERSON>, marine mammal researcher at the
department's <ORGANIZATION>Florida Research Institute</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``It's the worst winter die-off we've had since we've been
counting,'' he said. ``They are literally coming in so fast we
can't keep our records up.''
   Ackerman's department has been documenting manatee deaths since
<DATE>1974</DATE>.
   Most of the carcasses have been found in the waters off <LOCATION>Brevard
County</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Violet Stewart</PERSON>, an institute spokeswoman, said 27 of the
gentle sea cows have been found there.
   ``It appears that the water over there got particularly cold,''
she said. ``We had some reports of water temperatures down into the
40s.''
   She said marine biologists estimate that 25 to 30 of the deaths
are cold-related, although precise causes will take time to
determine.
   ``They are finding that manatees died with this cold snap and
they sank,'' <PERSON>Ms. Stewart</PERSON> said. ``As they decay they rise to the
surface, so they are just now being recovered.''
   <PERSON>Ackerman</PERSON> said that since manatees are tropical, they have no
layer of blubber like seals and whales.
   ``They lose their ability to digest food and gradually become
more run-down,'' he said. ``When they get run-down, they lose the
ability to swim to a warmer place.''
   Last year, there were a record 165 manatee deaths. Biologists
estimate that <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> has only 1,200 of the endangered creatures
left.

with an income less than 4 thousand manats will be 750 manats. 
  The government is entrusted with suspending the building of 
objects on account of the budget funds, beside those to be 
finished this year, cancelling all its previous decisions on 
privileged crediting of state enterprises, passing to the system 
of money compensation to socially low-protected residents 
instead of the system of privileged taxation of physical and 
juridical persons. 
  Since <DATE>June 16</DATE> the price of petrol AI-92 has increased from 
17 
to 100 manats per liter, and the price on bread -- from 20 to 80 
manats. In <DATE>May</DATE> the minimal consumer's basket made up 30 
thousand manats and the average wage -- 8.3 thousand manats, the 
minimal wage -- 900 manats.

<HEAD>Speed Limits Proposed To Curb Florida Boating Deaths</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Florida leads the nation in boating deaths
and unless strict speed limits are set and enforced, the situation
will soon become unmanageable, state officials said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Department of Natural Resources</ORGANIZATION> officials opened three days of
public hearings on proposed new boating regulations with statistics
on <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>'s exploding population of boaters and the casualties they
cause among humans and the endangered manatee.
   Boaters killed 105 people in the state last year _ 2.5 times the
national average _ and set a record in known manatee deaths with 29.
That record has already been surpassed this year with 37 manatee
deaths.
   The state has about 1 million registered and non-registered boats
and 3.5 million to 4 million people operating them, he said.
   ``It's very congested out there now, and with 100 boats being
added to the state total every day, we will double the number in the
next 10 years,'' said <PERSON>Don Ellingson</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>DNR</ORGANIZATION>'s director of the
<ORGANIZATION>Division of Law Enforcement</ORGANIZATION>. ``Unless we find ways to deal with that
congestion, we're going to have problems.''
   A key issue is expected to be the state's proposal of a statewide
speed limit of 30 mph on navigational channels in inland waterways.
This would drop to 20 mph in 12 counties with large numbers of the
sea cows.
   Except for a hodge-podge of local go-slow ordinances, there are
no boating speed limits now.
   Local and county elected officials and regulatory agency staffers
from <LOCATION>Dade</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Sarasota</LOCATION>, Brevard and Suwannee counties expresed support
for the proposed rules, with some reservations and suggestions for
fine-tuning.
   The 12 counties being considered for manatee-protecting speed
limits are Brevard, <LOCATION>Broward</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Citrus</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Collier</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Dade</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Duval</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Indian
River</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Lee</PERSON>, <PERSON>Martin</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Palm Beach</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>St. Lucie</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Volusia</LOCATION>.
   Commissioner <PERSON>Charles Williams</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Suwannee County</LOCATION> said that while
there was support for the <ORGANIZATION>DNR</ORGANIZATION> proposals, he suggested a maximum
speed limit of 40 mph because of the importance of water skiing in
the state. Skiers say it is impossible to carry out their maneuvers
at 30 mph.

IVORY COAST PLANS RESERVE FOR MANATEE

<P>
Plans are under way to create the first reserve in <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> for the manatee, the 
1-ton, 10-foot-long underwater cousin of the elephant. 
</P>
<P>
The manatees live in lagoons, rivers and coastal areas from <LOCATION>Senegal</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Angola</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The reserve, on an inlet of the <LOCATION>Bandama River</LOCATION> near <LOCATION>Abidjan</LOCATION>, could be 
established as soon as <DATE>March</DATE>, according to <ORGANIZATION>Gbande Die</ORGANIZATION>, director of the adjacent 
<ORGANIZATION>Azagny National Park</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"This will be the first protected zone for manatees in <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>," Die said in an 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
No one knows precisely how many manatees, also known as sea cows, there are in 
<LOCATION>Abidjan</LOCATION>, whose oceanfront lagoons make ideal habitats, but officials say the 
population is dwindling and estimate their numbers in the hundreds rather than 
thousands. 
</P>
<P>
"When we ask the peasants, they tell us they used to see lots of manatees and 
now they don't," Die said. 
</P>
<P>
The reserve will allow scientists to study manatees, which are found in 
<LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>West Indies</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> basin and <LOCATION>West Africa</LOCATION>, and whose behavior 
is little known. 
</P>
<P>
The experts will also determine how best to protect the animals, which are 
hunted for their beef-like flesh. 
</P>
<P>
Manatees are mammals and had a common ancestor with the elephant 75 million 
years ago. They have been a protected species since this former French colony 
became independent in <DATE>1960</DATE>, but that has not stopped fishermen from poaching 
them. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to enforce because the law is just a piece of paper," Die said. "And 
it's not just manatees, it's virtually all wild animals in <LOCATION>Ivory Coast</LOCATION> that 
suffer." 
</P>
<P>
Much of the impetus for creating the reserve and protecting manatees arises 
from work here by <PERSON>James Powell</PERSON>, 34, an American naturalist from <ORGANIZATION>Wildlife 
Conservation International</ORGANIZATION>, an arm of the <ORGANIZATION>New York Zoological Society</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"We should be as concerned about the manatees as we are about the rhinoceros," 
<PERSON>Powell</PERSON> said recently. "Manatees are big, impressive and unique. There is 
nothing else like them." 
</P>
<P>
He said that manatees, whose night-time squeals are believed to have sparked 
mermaid myths and who are associated in <LOCATION>West Africa</LOCATION> with a spirit called "<PERSON>Mamie 
Wata</PERSON>," are timid and gentle. 
</P>
<P>
The West African manatee, which has a wide muzzle and a long, bulbous trunk 
with two side flippers, looks a bit like a toothless walrus or a sea lion. 
</P>
<P>
"They are extremely strong but they don't seem to have an aggressive bone in 
their bodies," said <PERSON>Powell</PERSON>, who has trapped 18 manatees to fit them with radio 
transmitters so he can track their movements. He was able to work with them 
without tranquilizing them. 
</P>
<P>
He said that visitors have flocked to see a baby manatee he raised in a pen 
near a popular beach resort, but the animal died several months ago. 
</P>
<P>
He doubted that the dark-gray manatees, which are almost impossible to see in 
the murky lagoons, could become a tourist attraction, as they have in <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>. 
But <PERSON>Powell</PERSON> thinks man and manatee could learn to live side by side. 
</P>
<P>
"They have an important role in the estuarine environment," he said. "They are 
the only large herbivores, so they eat off the unwanted vegetation." 
</P>
<P>
He also said that if hunting were regulated manatees could provide an important 
source of protein. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Powell</PERSON> and officials of <ORGANIZATION>Ivory Coast's Ministry of Water</ORGANIZATION> and Forests said the 
key to saving the manatee is learning more about them and educating fishermen 
about the perils of poaching. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Kouadio Akoi</PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION>Education Ministry</ORGANIZATION> officer who works with <PERSON>Powell</PERSON>, said that it 
is hard to persuade people to give up a source of food but that it can be done. 
</P>
<P>
"The fishermen tell us, 'First you say don't kill the tortoise, then you say 
don't kill the manatee -- what are we going to eat?' "But the disappearance of 
an animal would be a loss to everybody. We have a heritage we have to leave to 
our children."

<FÊP=106> [Unattributed article: "The Peasants Will Be Satisfied. </F>
Grain Procurement Prices Raised"] 
  [Text] In order to increase the material incentive for 
producers to increase volumes of grain sales to the state and in 
order to save on the expenditure of hard currency funds on the 
acquisition of grain from abroad, and also taking into account 
the higher costs of material and technical resources and energy 
sources used on the farms, the growth of inflation, and the 
higher prices on the world market, the <LOCATION>Azerbaijan</LOCATION> Cabinet of 
Ministers considered it expedient to adopt the proposals of the 
<ORGANIZATION>Ministry of Agriculture</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>State Grain Products Company</ORGANIZATION>, and 
the <ORGANIZATION>Ministry of Economics</ORGANIZATION> to raise prices of grain from internal 
reserves. 
  As an AZERTADZH correspondent was told in the <ORGANIZATION>Ministry of 
Agriculture</ORGANIZATION>, the average selling price of one tonne of grain 
from the <DATE>1994</DATE> crop sold to the state is 50,000 manats, a 
sevenfold increase over last year's prices. Taking into account 
the fact that priority in raising procurement prices has been 
given to hard and strong strains of wheat, the following prices 
have been set: for one tonne of hard wheat meeting requirements 
of class I--65,000 manats, of class II--62,000 manats, and of 
class III--55,000 manats; for strong and soft strains, 
regardless of class--48,000-53,000 manats; for one tonne of 
barley--46,000 manats, of corn--50,000 manats, and of peas for 
human consumption--94,000 manats. 
  The ministry has prepared additional recommendations in 
order 
to increase the material incentive for machine operators and 
other workers to harvest the grain at optimal times and without 
losses. It is stipulated that each combine operator 
participating in the harvest may be issued as wages 50 manats 
and 10 kilograms of grain, and their assistants, 35 manats and 7 
kilograms of grain for each tonne harvested; truck drivers are 
to be issued, in addition to their wages, one kilogram of grain 
for each tonne that is transported. Additionally, combine 
operators are to be paid bonuses in the amount of 1,500-2,500 
manats, depending on the volume of grain reaped during the 
season. 
  <ORGANIZATION>Ministry of Agriculture</ORGANIZATION> workers think that raising grain 
procurement prices will have a positive effect on strengthening 
the economies of the farms, will increase the material incentive 
for workers, and will make it possible to achieve an increase in 
the volumes of grain sold to the state.

Article Type:BFN 

<FÊP=106> [Report by Arif Useynov: "Manats Float"] </F>
  [Text] <LOCATION>Baku</LOCATION> -- The manat -- the national monetary unit of 
<LOCATION>Azerbaijan</LOCATION> -- has had a difficult time. It is losing value not 
by the day but by the hour. To cover up this patent devaluation 
the <ORGANIZATION>National Bank of Azerbaijan</ORGANIZATION> periodically sets a new manat 
rate against the currencies of the former <ORGANIZATION>Union</ORGANIZATION> republics. 
  The initial rate was confusing -- one manat to 10 Russian 
rubles [R]. Why not 20? Commercial bank specialists have 
reason to call a "ceiling" -- this arbitrarily established rate 
has not been borne out by any exchange trading. So what 
prompted the new rate of one to 14? 
  As a rule, attempts to discern the economic laws on which 
the 
exchange rate is based prove pointless. 
  On the currency black market -- the famous "Molokanka" (from 
the name of a pleasant little square in downtown <LOCATION>Baku</LOCATION>) -- people 
are trading at a rate of R1,000 to 275 manats, paying no 
attention to the bankers' sluggishness. The people on the 
square do not rule out the possibility that in a month or so a 
ruble could be worth the same as a manat. 
  Hyperinflation has long been part and parcel of the 
Azerbaijani economy, forcing the manat into the most improbable 
contortions. This was to be expected: Deformations in the 
economy seem to happen on their own, and the manat has been left 
to its own devices, as if orphaned. Despite the fact that state 
property has not been privatized and the mechanism of market 
relations has not been fully realized, the new manat has been 
allowed to float. No currency can function normally without a 
weight of goods to back it -- and home-produced goods at that. 
Having failed to make deliveries of output and goods outside 
the republic under the clearing system, enterprises have been 
deprived of reciprocal shipments worth <MONEY>6 billion manats</MONEY>. Half 
of last year's cotton and grape crops were not harvested. 
Meanwhile <PERCENT>80 percent</PERCENT> of foodstuffs are bought on the side for 
foreign currency -- weak petrodollars. And these are getting 
fewer and further between, since oil extraction in the republic 
has fallen by 800,000 tonnes. 
  There is no harm in admitting that home-grown businessmen 
are 
making a good living from the people's baleful position. The 
state owes <MONEY>22 billion manats</MONEY> in wages and pensions, while 
ministries, departments, enterprises, and commercial structures 
are keeping R27 billion that they owe to others in Russian bank 
accounts, earning fabulous rates of interest. 
  President <PERSON>Heydar Aliyev</PERSON> has demanded that the leaders of 
debtor organizations repatriate forthwith their exported capital 
or the products that have been bought with it. Meanwhile 
specialists believe that the hidden billions are unlikely to 
save the Azerbaijani economy. The following weighty argument is 
also quoted: Transactions with Russian banks are not effective 
[ne deystvuyut], and the <ORGANIZATION>Central Bank of Russia</ORGANIZATION> is hardly likely 
to agree to such operations, recalling <LOCATION>Azerbaijan</LOCATION>'s large debts. 
  Has not the time come to print larger-denomination manats? 
Those in circulation cannot keep up with galloping prices. The 
consignment of manats expected to arrive from <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> will be 
enough to pay the wage and pension backlog. 
  And the manat continues to float.

  [Text] <LOCATION>Baku</LOCATION>, 4 May (AZERTAC)--<LOCATION>Manat</LOCATION>, Azeri national 
monetary unit seems to undergo the same fate as the Ukrainian 
Karbovanets. The manats exchange rate against the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> dollar 
has gone down by 90 per cent and against the Russian ruble by 
2.5 times correspondingly. Thus, today one <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> dollar costs 
<DATE>1000</DATE> manats and the Russian ruble 0.6 manats. The Azeri 
currency's rapid downfall provoked a feverish mood in the 
country. At <LOCATION>Baku</LOCATION>'s parallel market on Molokanka square, the 
exchange rate of the foreign currency is being updated up to 
three times a day. 
  However, official exchange rates have not been adapted yet. 
According to the information available, the Azeri national bank 
pays 182.5 manats per dollar and <MONEY>1 manat</MONEY> per 10 Russian rubles. 
That is why the center of currency transactions has moved from 
banking offices at the parallel market. According to 
specialists view, this is one more factor provoking the 
disastrous downfall of the local currency. 
  Azeri experts consider the principal reason of the present 
economic situation the absence of a flexible monetary policy in 
<LOCATION>Azerbaijan</LOCATION>. Some experts explain this situation by the small 
amount of foreign currency that is being earned by <LOCATION>Azerbaijan</LOCATION> 
since the <ORGANIZATION>Republic</ORGANIZATION>'s industry has virtually stopped working. 
Moreover, the manat has not become an independent currency and 
its condition depends on fluctuation of rate of exchange of the 
Russian ruble as the national bank has not determined the manats 
real value so far. One of the local televisions observers has 
expressed a very original opinion concerning this situation. He 
explained it by the reason that governmental officers take their 
bribes in freely convertible currency only. However, he may 
guess all too near: <LOCATION>Baku</LOCATION> newspapers give many examples of this 
kind. 
  Though predictions are dismal -- experts think that dollars 
rate will increase in about 40 per cent every month -- the 
<LOCATION>Republic</LOCATION> is trying to find the way out from this crisis. 
Abolition of the law of limitation on export of strategic goods 
will undoubtedly provide more constant flow of currency. The 
experts think that the situation might be improved by creation 
of currency exchange offices where monetary transactions will be 
done in accordance with the reasonable rates of currency. The 
experts also say that development of the local industry and 
creation of normal conditions for small enterprises will be more 
effective in this case. 
  However, present monetary and credit crisis resulted in 
retirement of administration of the national bank. Through the 
ever falling manats exchange rate more people live below the 
poverty line. Now 60 per cent of the republics population -- 
about 4 million people -- live in poverty. According to one of 
<LOCATION>Baku</LOCATION>'s newspapers, each of the poor needs 12,600 manats monthly, 
if not to take inflation into consideration, in order to satisfy 
the minimum needs. This amount of money is 70 and 170 per cent 
as much as it was necessary in <DATE>March</DATE> and <DATE>January this year</DATE>. 
According to <ORGANIZATION>Ministry of Labour and Social Security</ORGANIZATION>, one 
citizen needs 16 thousand manats for showing a sign of life, it 
is a so-called physiological minimum. 
  Meanwhile, a minimum salary of <MONEY>900 manats</MONEY> is enough to buy 
half a kilogram of meat. So an average citizen of the Republic 
has to display miracles of resourcefulness in order not to kick 
the bucket.

<FÊP=106> [Unattributed report: "Draft State Budget Sent to Parliament </F>
for Approval"] 
  [Text] According to the republic's deputy minister of 
finance, <PERSON>Fikret Yusifov</PERSON>, the income part of the budget assumes 
revenue of <MONEY>138.4746 billion manats</MONEY>, and the expense 
part--<MONEY>181.3717 billion manats</MONEY>. Thus, the budget will have a 
deficit of <MONEY>42.8971 billion manats</MONEY>. 
  F. Yusifov noted that such a large deficit is the result of 
a 
decline in the level of production, which has dropped 
several-fold as compared to <DATE>1992</DATE>. In order to cover the deficit, 
the following steps are being planned, in particular: 
implementation of the state privatization program, which will 
help to earn <MONEY>5 billion manats</MONEY>; changing prices for alcoholic 
beverages, which should bring 1.3 billion into the budget; 
raising prices for fuel and energy and bread; introducing 
value-added tax on imported goods, which will bring in 4.6 
billion over the remaining seven months; and so on. The deputy 
minister of finance also emphasized that raising the minimum 
wage from 900 to 2,000 manats is in the works, which will 
require additional budget expenditures. This difference is 
expected to be covered by raising retail prices on gasoline and 
the recently approved tax in the amount equal to two minimum 
wages on each square meter of space occupied by commercial trade 
and public catering entities. <PERSON>F. Yusifov</PERSON> said, however, that 
raising the minimum wage will only lead to another jump in 
market prices and in the final count an even greater decline in 
the population's living standard. As a KHABAR-SERVICE 
correspondent learned from competent sources in the republic 
government, three options for raising gasoline prices are now 
under consideration: 40, 50, and 60 manats per liter. Most 
likely the middle figure will be chosen, which will bring into 
the budget an additional <MONEY>25-30 billion manats</MONEY>, but still will 
not be enough to raise the minimum wage.

<FÊP=106> [Arif Useynov report: "<LOCATION>Azerbaijan</LOCATION>: Panic on the Black </F>
Market"] 
  [Text] <LOCATION>Baku</LOCATION> -- It would appear that the situation that had 
been long predicted has become a reality: The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> dollar has 
shot up to 1,000 manats on the black market. Thus the 
population is <PERCENT>20 percent</PERCENT> poorer, since the day before the same 
dollar could be bought for 800 manats. The same has happened 
with the exchange rate of the Russian ruble -- on the black 
market it is expressed in terms of the dollar rate and has 
reached 1 manat to 2 rubles. The manat is clearly dropping away. 
  Correspondingly, prices of basic necessities also shot up, 
getting beyond the reach of the majority of the population. The 
opposition press believes that what is happening on the currency 
market is the consequence of serious economic upheavals. In 
particular, the opinion is being expressed that the financial 
magnates who manipulate black market transactions are ready to 
blow the situation in the republic apart from within. It is not 
yet clear according to what scenario events will develop. The 
population has been agitated by the explosion of prices on the 
market -- a minimum salary today will only buy 1.5 kg of beef.

  [Text] <LOCATION>Baku</LOCATION>, <DATE>June 20</DATE> (TURAN) -- <PERSON>Gudrat Abdulsalimzade</PERSON>, head 
of the <ORGANIZATION>Committee for Property</ORGANIZATION> told at today's press-conference 
that the <ORGANIZATION>Committee</ORGANIZATION> submitted to the Milli Mejlis new draft of 
privatization program. 
  The new draft provides increase of privatisation share of 
each civilian of the republic to 120,000 manats. "It has been 
done in connection with the last overestimation of the 
privatised property", said <PERSON>Abdulsalimzade</PERSON>. 
  According to the program 8,768 enterprises and objects are 
scheduled to be privatized in <DATE>1994</DATE>. It makes <PERCENT>14.8 percent</PERCENT> of 
all enterprises and objects of the republic, covers <PERCENT>5 percent</PERCENT> of 
all funds and <PERCENT>3.1 percent</PERCENT> of all employees working in the state 
section. 
  Expenses for privatisations will total <MONEY>400 million manats</MONEY> in 
<DATE>1994</DATE>, said the Head of the <ORGANIZATION>Committee</ORGANIZATION>. According to him, "small" 
privatization, i.e. privatization of enterprises totalling no 
more than 200 people, is to complete in <DATE>1995</DATE>. Middle and part 
of large enterprises will be privatized during 1996-1998. 
  Answering journalists question concerning the delay in the 
adoption of the program, even after it was signed by President, 
<PERSON>Abdulsalimzade</PERSON> said that there are people in the highest 
legislative body and in the ministries and among the leaders of 
enterprises, opposing the privatization program. 
  The high rank employee of the <ORGANIZATION>Committee for Property</ORGANIZATION> told 
TURAN that there are two approaches to this problem in the 
highest circles. "The part of them want to organise wholesale 
of state property, the others are opposed [to] privatization at 
all, referring to the war. "Privatization will not take place 
until they come to common decision", said the employee. 
  Law for privatization was adopted in <LOCATION>Azerbaijan</LOCATION> on <DATE>January 
7, 
1993</DATE>. Up to today only 5,000 taximotors [taxicabs] are 
privatized in the country.

<FÊP=106> [Report by correspondent <PERSON>Grigoriy Kolodin</PERSON>: "The Manat Has </F>
Prompted Respect for...the Ruble"] 
  [Text] <LOCATION>Turkmenia</LOCATION> -- It has been nearly five months since 
the introduction of the national currency in <LOCATION>Turkmenia</LOCATION> -- the 
manat. That is certainly long enough to consider the initial 
results of the circulation of the new money and what effect this 
unavoidable step has had on the country's economy. It was 
indeed unavoidable, although banknotes and coins manufactured 
beforehand in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>, were ready and waiting, but the 
government thought that at that time <LOCATION>Turkmenia</LOCATION> was not yet fully 
prepared for the switch to its own currency. It was only when 
it became obvious that the Russian authorities were planning to 
force their <ORGANIZATION>CIS</ORGANIZATION> neighbors out of the ruble zone that <LOCATION>Turkmenia</LOCATION> 
accelerated the introduction of the manat. 
  <DATE>November</DATE> was a month of euphoria and...empty pocketbooks. 
The exchange of citizens' savings was carried out in such a way 
as to drastically reduce the money supply. However, even with a 
mere handful of coins in his pocket, a person felt quite 
solvent. For 5 kopeks (that is what people here habitually call 
the small change -- the tenge) you could buy the latest 
newspaper or eat a bread roll, and for 20 you could buy a loaf 
or stick of wheaten bread. With 2 chervonets, you could buy 10 
eggs, some green vegetables, and a couple of kilograms of 
apples. Potatoes cost 1 manat, and, just as in the good old 
days of stagnation, traders would stick cardboard price tickets 
into their piles of late melons, saying "1 melon -- 1 ruble." 
And although, after the first pay packets were issued in the 
new money, the Turkmens learned to count their small change in a 
new way, for an average wage of 400 manats you could not only 
feed yourself, but also buy, say, a pair of Italian shoes for 
110 manats or a washing machine for 120 manats. 
  Alas, <DATE>November</DATE> and <DATE>December</DATE>, when the family budget was 
"tight" but you could fill a bag with food products for a small 
sum, are remembered here today as months of plenty and days of 
bright hopes which, unfortunately, are not yet fated to become 
reality. In <LOCATION>Turkmenia</LOCATION> it is still not the custom to publish 
information on the inflation rate or to calculate the cost of 
the consumer basket, but every inhabitant of the Republic can 
see for himself every day how life is growing increasingly 
expensive. Meat prices in the bazaars have risen from 5 to <MONEY>50 
manats</MONEY> a kilogram, the cost of fruit and vegetables has also 
gone up, for the third month in succession the shelves of stores 
selling industrial products are practically empty, and in the 
few commercial stores the prices are certainly not suited to 
people who are living only on a wage. And without the 
continuing government subsidies on flour and bread for the 
population, so that bread still costs 20-30 tenge, without the 
free provision of electricity, natural gas, and water and the 
very low cost of housing, of sending children to preschool 
institutions, and of travel on public transport, things would be 
very tight indeed for the Turkmens. 
  It is certainly not the manat as such that is to blame for 
the fact that the Republic, which in all previous years had a 
deficit-free budget, is today spending more than it receives. 
The financial hole in the state's pocket was caused by the huge 
debts of the former brothers in the Union for natural gas 
supplied in the past year. It is no joking matter that 
<LOCATION>Turkmenia</LOCATION> is owed <MONEY>$1.5 billion</MONEY> by <LOCATION>Ukraine</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Azerbaijan</LOCATION>, 
and the other <ORGANIZATION>CIS</ORGANIZATION> countries -- a shortfall of nearly 380 
"greenbacks" for every local inhabitant. The main debtors -- 
<LOCATION>Ukraine</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION> -- asked for their last year's debt of <MONEY>$700 
million</MONEY> and <MONEY>$200 million</MONEY> respectively to be classified as a 
<ORGANIZATION>Turkmen Government</ORGANIZATION> loan. Their wishes were accommodated, but 
the first two months of this year elapsed without either <LOCATION>Ukraine</LOCATION> 
or <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION> keeping its promise -- to pay for gas every 10 days. 
It was necessary to resort to extreme measures and close the 
valves on the pipelines to <LOCATION>Ukraine</LOCATION>. But apparently the 
Ukrainian authorities are today more worried about the purely 
internal political struggle and the disastrous decline of their 
own economy. 
  President <PERSON>Saparmurad Niyazov</PERSON> and his team are intensively 
seeking a way out of the crisis situation. Preparations have 
been stepped up for the implementation if the plan for a gas 
pipeline which will convey Turkmen natural fuel via <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> and 
<LOCATION>Turkey</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>. The possibility of pumping gas through 
<LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> is being examined. A major reform of 
the agrarian sector is under way: More than 50,000 hectares of 
formerly unused land has been handed over to private ownership. 
  But for the moment the manat remains a sideshoot of the 
dollar and the ruble. Its real rate is falling rapidly. Having 
ostensibly been set as equivalent to <MONEY>50 cents</MONEY> and 500 Russian 
rubles in <DATE>November</DATE>, today it only runs to <MONEY>1 cent</MONEY> and 20 rubles. 
The lack of Russian currency in the banks has been a severe blow 
to state and business structures, which are <PERCENT>80 percent</PERCENT> "tied" to 
<LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION>. Contracts are being broken, former links are being 
lost, and business circles can be heard increasingly frequently 
dreaming: "If only we were back in the ruble area! We cannot 
survive without <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> yet..." 
  As for survival, this is, of course, a slight exaggeration. 
But common sense and the example of Belorusia [<LOCATION>Belarus</LOCATION>] 
suggests that it is not a question of what picture there is on 
the banknotes, but of preventing them from degenerating into 
pretty colored candy wrappers.

the wily <PERSON>Mr Aliyev</PERSON> has carved himself out a significant chunk of <PERSON>Mr
Elchibey</PERSON>'s power and that new elections are likely. Given the present
despondent political mood, <PERSON>Mr Aliyev</PERSON> probably would be <LOCATION>Azerbaijan</LOCATION>'s
strongest presidential candidate.
The political and economic deterioration was demonstrated when <LOCATION>Baku</LOCATION>
newspapers yesterday announced that <PERSON>Mr Elchibey</PERSON> had postponed complete
introduction of <LOCATION>Azerbaijan</LOCATION>'s new currency, the manat.
The government, which began circulating the manat on <DATE>June 2</DATE>, had announced
that the rouble would be invalidated on <DATE>June 15</DATE>, but the move now has been
delayed at least until <DATE>July 1</DATE>. 'We need to wait until the situation
stabilises. As soon as that happens, the reforms will take place,' said <PERSON>Mr
Elman Rustamov</PERSON>, deputy chairman of the ministry of foreign economic
activity.
On <DATE>Monday</DATE> the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> embassy recommended that American nationals leave the
country, and many foreign businessmen, including oil company employees, have
departed on flights to <LOCATION>Istanbul</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION>.
It was not clear whether <LOCATION>Azerbaijan</LOCATION>'s political upheaval was over. <PERSON>Mr
Aliyev</PERSON>'s comeback was forewarned a week ago, when rebel troops seized
<LOCATION>Azerbaijan</LOCATION>'s second city, <LOCATION>Gyanja</LOCATION>, and demanded <PERSON>Mr Elchibey</PERSON>'s resignation.
Though the troops, led by a charismatic businessman, <PERSON>Mr Surat Huseynov</PERSON>, have
voiced their support for <PERSON>Mr Aliyev</PERSON>, they now have taken control of up to
half the Caspian Sea nation, and are within 70 miles of <LOCATION>Baku</LOCATION>.
<PERSON>Mr Elchibey</PERSON>, whose popularity has steadily waned since he came to power
about a year ago, has threatened to use force to defend his government. But
it is unclear how much loyalty he still enjoys in the military, or among the
Azeri population of 7m.
The key factor in <PERSON>Mr Elchibey</PERSON>'s loss of popularity have been the lack of
economic improvements and a string of military defeats in the war in the
enclave of <LOCATION>Nagorno-Karabakh</LOCATION>. On <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> ethnic Armenians from
<ORGANIZATION>Nagorno-Karabakh</ORGANIZATION> finally agreed to a brokered settlement. But at the same
time ethnic Armenian troops appeared to be encircling yet another important
city in the region, <LOCATION>Agdam</LOCATION>, which actually lies outside <LOCATION>Nagorno-Karabakh</LOCATION>.
The continued fighting was bound to put new pressure on <PERSON>Mr Elchibey</PERSON>, and
give <PERSON>Mr Aliyev</PERSON> a stronger hand ultimately to topple him.

<LEADPARA>  ONE of the most useful holiday gifts you can give a child is a book that
teaches appreciation of the Earth and the importance of taking care of it.
Until a few years ago, there were few good ones. But now environmentalism for
kids is a growing field, and there are a number of excellent books to choose
from.;   Here are four that you can probably find in a local store, with
quotes to give you an idea of the style and suitable age group. But be sure to
ask for recommendations at your local bookstore. There are new eco-books being
published all the time.  </LEADPARA>

Sample: "The tops of the trees in the rain forest are called the canopy. The
canopy is a sunny place that touches the sky. The animals that live there like
lots of light. Colorful parrots fly from tree to tree. Monkeys leap from

reduce waste is to avoid buying anything that is over-packaged. Here you can

<FÊP=106> [Republic of <LOCATION>Azerbaijan</LOCATION> presidential edict: "Measures To </F>
Increase Social Protection of the Population and Financial 
Stabilization of the Economy"] 
  [Text] The increase in inflation and the decline in 
production have led in recent times to a lowering of the living 
standard of society and have exerted a negative influence on the 
financial state of the republic. This has been connected to a 
decisive extent with the inefficient use of the financial and 
credit resources of public enterprises and organizations, the 
unjustified increase in their crossover into nonstate 
structures, and the absence of precise mechanisms of the pursuit 
of a price policy and the regulation of wages and the currency 
market. All this is creating difficulties for the implementation 
of the program of market transformations and bringing about a 
growth of socioeconomic tension. 
  To increase social protection of the population and ensure 
financial stabilization of the economy I resolve: 
  1. To establish as of 1 <DATE>June 1994</DATE> minimum remuneration at 
<MONEY>2,000 manat</MONEY> a month. 
  2. To appoint as of 1 <DATE>June 1994</DATE> for social and nonworking 
retirees, students of day courses at higher educational 
institutions, and trainees of technical schools and 
vocational-technical schools monetary compensation amounting to 
1,500 manat, and for families with a per capita monthly income 
of less than the minimum wage times two, monetary compensation 
amounting to <MONEY>750 manat</MONEY> a month per child 16 years of age and 
under. These sums of compensation shall be paid from the 
resources of the republic budget. 
  To consider lapsed in this connection the Republic of 
<LOCATION>Azerbaijan</LOCATION> presidential edict of 22 <DATE>November 1993</DATE> "Payment of 
Compensation to Nonworking Retirees" and clause two of Republic 
of <LOCATION>Azerbaijan</LOCATION> presidential edict of 22 <DATE>November 1993</DATE> 
"Supplementary Measures in the Field of Regulation of the <ORGANIZATION>Price 
of Bread and Bakery Products</ORGANIZATION> and Increased Social Protection for 
the Needy Strata of the Populace." 
  3. That the <ORGANIZATION>Republic of Azerbaijan Cabinet of Ministers</ORGANIZATION> 
shall 
implement the following system of anti-inflation measures to 
ensure financial stabilization in the economy: 
  as of 16 <DATE>June 1994</DATE>, increase the prices of energy and bread 
and hence forward review them not less than quarterly with 
regard to the rate of inflation; 
  within three days' time, make the corresponding changes, 
based on coordinated proposals of the <ORGANIZATION>Ministry of Finance</ORGANIZATION> and 
the <ORGANIZATION>Ministry of Labor and Social Protection</ORGANIZATION> of the Populace, to 
the uniform wage scale for workers and employees to prevent the 
formation of an appreciable gap between the remuneration of 
employees of the low-income and high-income categories; 
  prior to the end of <DATE>1994</DATE>, suspend the construction of 
facilities financed from funds of the republic budget, except 
for projects of the current year that are close to completion, 
and adopt measures to ensure the safe preservation of these 
facilities; 
  reverse the decisions it adopted earlier on public 
enterprises being granted soft loans; 
  in interaction with the banks, adopt measures to ensure the 
public enterprises' repayment of credit within the established 
timeframe; 
  within two weeks' time, present proposals for the 
reorganization of the structure of the central organs of state 
administration in the direction of a reduction in their numbers 
and also a downsizing of staff and administrative-managerial 
costs, thanks to a reduction in the number of official motor 
vehicles included; 
  within 10 days' time, devise rules for the allocation of the 
resources of public enterprises and organizations on charitable 
purposes and introduce a precise mechanism of supervision to 
ensure that these resources be used as specifically intended; 
  within 10 days' time, confirm the maximum rate of use of the 
profits of public enterprises and organizations for wages; 
  in the necessary quantity to partially cover the budget 
deficit, provide for the manufacture and sale of government 
securities; 
  within a month's time, prepare and present proposals 
concerning a transition from the system of tax and nontax 
privileges for particular categories of individuals and legal 
entities to a system of monetary compensation for the socially 
unprotected strata of the populace; 
  ensure strict compliance with legislation on the 
registration 
and issue of a certificate to higher and secondary specialized 
educational institutions and adopt the necessary measures aimed 
at a reduction in the admittance of trainees to 
vocational-technical schools and of students to evening and 
correspondence departments of higher educational institutions 
funded from the state budget; 
  within a month's time, devise and present for consideration 
by the president of the Republic of <LOCATION>Azerbaijan</LOCATION> a concept for 
transition to insurance medicine and also proposals pertaining 
to its legal support. 
  4. That the <ORGANIZATION>Republic of Azerbaijan Ministry of Economics</ORGANIZATION> and 
the <ORGANIZATION>State Committee for Antitrust Policy</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Support of 
Enterprise</ORGANIZATION> shall intensify supervision of the formation of 
prices at public enterprises that are monopolies and 
systematically present to the <ORGANIZATION>Republic of Azerbaijan Cabinet of 
Ministers</ORGANIZATION> information on enterprises permitting a deviation from 
the market prices of the products (services) they manufacture 
(provide). 
  That the <ORGANIZATION>Republic of Azerbaijan Cabinet of Ministers</ORGANIZATION> shall 
adopt stringent measures against enterprise executives 
permitting such a deviation. 
  5. That the <ORGANIZATION>Republic of Azerbaijan Ministry of Finance</ORGANIZATION> 
shall: 
  within a month's time conduct an audit of the resources of 
public enterprises and organizations diverted into founder's and 
other contributions to the nonstate sector of the economy. 
  That the <ORGANIZATION>Republic of Azerbaijan Cabinet of Ministers</ORGANIZATION> shall 
provide for the adoption of specific measures for the more 
efficient use of these resources; 
  provide for the precise delineation of the republic and 
local 
budgets, broadening the independence of the local budgets with 
regard to the fuller use of levers of their formation; 
  with regard to inflation review quarterly in conjunction 
with 
the <ORGANIZATION>Main State Tax Inspectorate</ORGANIZATION> of the Republic of <LOCATION>Azerbaijan</LOCATION> 
the treasury tax receipt targets. 
  6. To propose that the <ORGANIZATION>National Bank of the Republic of 
Azerbaijan</ORGANIZATION>: 
  tighten the reserve requirements in respect to 
joint-stock-commercial and commercial banks and, with regard to 
the rate of growth of inflation, review quarterly the discount 
rate on centralized credit resources; 
  disallow the practice of the mutual off-setting of arrears 
between enterprises and organizations; 
  implement measures to terminate lending to enterprises and 
organizations with foreign currency assets; 
  adopt all measures to ensure the stabilization of the 
exchange rate of the manat and the regular operation of the <ORGANIZATION>Baku 
Interbank Currency Exchange</ORGANIZATION>. For this purpose authorize the 
<ORGANIZATION>National Bank of the Republic of Azerbaijan</ORGANIZATION>, following 
consultation with the president of the <ORGANIZATION>Republic of Azerbaijan</ORGANIZATION>, 
to use resources of the Stabilization Fund for restrained 
intervention in the interbank currency market; 
  provide in conjunction with the joint-stock-commercial 
agro-industrial and industrial-investment banks for their 
transition as of 1 <DATE>July 1994</DATE> to a system of correspondent 
accounts to prevent the issue of credit not backed by resources; 
  adopt in conjunction with the <ORGANIZATION>Republic of Azerbaijan 
Ministry 
of Economics</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Republic of Azerbaijan Ministry of Finance</ORGANIZATION>, 
and the <ORGANIZATION>Republic of Azerbaijan Main State Tax Inspectorate</ORGANIZATION> 
measures to stabilize monetary circulation and reduce money 
issue by means of the establishment of a stimulatory deposit 
interest rate and regulation of the activity of the commercial 
sector in the sphere of monetary circulation. 
  7. For an increase in the efficiency of the use of public 
financial resources to propose that public enterprises and 
organizations switch to full credit-payment and cash service in 
joint-stock-commercial banks whose controlling block of shares 
is publicly owned. That the <ORGANIZATION>Republic of Azerbaijan Cabinet of 
Ministers</ORGANIZATION> shall implement urgent measures in this sphere. 
  8. To propose that the <ORGANIZATION>Republic of Azerbaijan National 
Assembly</ORGANIZATION> speed up the confirmation of the guidelines of the 
credit policy of the Republic of <LOCATION>Azerbaijan</LOCATION> for <DATE>1994</DATE> and the 
official program of privatization as an important means of 
economic and financial stabilization and the adoption of a law 
on property and other legislative instruments ensuring a legal 
basis for the transition to a market economy. 
  9. To commission the <ORGANIZATION>Republic of Azerbaijan Cabinet of

<PERSON>Donna Castle</PERSON>'s fourth-graders in <LOCATION>Milford</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pa.</LOCATION>, have adopted an injured 
red-tailed hawk named the <ORGANIZATION>Red Baroness</ORGANIZATION>. Nine-year-old <PERSON>Stephen Raba</PERSON> thinks of 
the hawk as his own. 
</P>
<P>
"He talks about it all the time, about his bird. He takes it personally," said 
his mother, <PERSON>Lynne Raba</PERSON>. "When some of the class went to see it, he was adamant 
that he had to go, that it was so important. It's something that he takes a lot 
of pride in." 
</P>
<P>
The students at <ORGANIZATION>Dingman Delaware Elementary School</ORGANIZATION> recycled <MONEY>$25</MONEY> worth of 
aluminum cans to adopt the bird for one month at a nearby rehabilitation center 
for injured and orphaned birds of prey. The children are hoping they can keep 
the <ORGANIZATION>Red Baroness</ORGANIZATION> on the mend until she's ready to be released into the wild. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, financial foster parents are being sought for a manatee in <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, 
baby puffins off the coast of <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> gray whales in the <LOCATION>Pacific 
Ocean</LOCATION>. A <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> trout stream can be adopted for an investment of labor, 
as can a <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> beach and an <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION> highway. 
</P>
<P>
Across the nation, environmental groups are offering "adoption" plans for wild 
birds and animals, their habitats and open spaces as a way to raise money 
anywhere nature is in trouble. The groups say more and more people are adopting 
the wild through contributions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Hands-On' Effort 
</P>
<P>
"It's hands-on. It's strong and it's powerful," says <PERSON>Pat Noonan</PERSON> of the 
Conservation Fund in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION> 
</P>
<P>
"The environmental movement is trying to reach out in creative ways to enlist 
volunteer support and involvement, and adopt-a-tree and adopt-a-whale are 
things people can identify with." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Jennifer Bates</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Whale Center</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, one of several 
organizations offering whales for adoption, says: "It's a gimmick, a hook, 
because everybody is hurting, everybody needs money. After you donate to a 
couple of organizations, chances are your mailbox is going to be inundated, so 
you want to be the one piece of mail folks will not throw out." 
</P>
<P>
Zoos and aviaries often sponsor adoption programs for both special projects and 
general upkeep, says <PERSON>Charles Wickenhauser</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Pittsburgh Zoo</ORGANIZATION>, which recently 
raised <MONEY>$6,500</MONEY> to build a new penguin exhibit through a "penguin parents" 
program. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the generation of baby boomers has less of a giving tradition than our 
parents did," he says. "We're trying to find the trigger for their giving and 
trying to find it in nontraditional ways -- what unlocks the purse." 
</P>
<P>
Adoption rates range from <MONEY>$10 to hundreds of dollars</MONEY>. The money is used either 
directly -- to buy housing, medical care and food for the adoptee -- or 
indirectly, to subsidize research, species preservation, educational programs 
or lobby efforts. 
</P>
<P>
In exchange, foster parents usually receive a glossy photograph and description 
of their animal, occasional updates about its comings and goings and, just like 
Cabbage Patch dolls, a certificate of adoption. 
</P>
<P>
But adoptions don't work for all environmental causes. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to have something that's there and identifiable, that you can 
photograph and put a name on," says <PERSON>Craig</PERSON> van <ORGANIZATION>Note of Monitor Consortium of 
Conservation and Animal Welfare Organizations</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Washington D.C.</LOCATION> 
</P>
<P>
"There's no way you can really adopt an elephant in <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>. In a case like 
that, you'd have to tell the people their elephant got killed last week, and 
that would be a downer." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Florida Manatees 
</P>
<P>
A <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> native, <PERSON>Debra Brown</PERSON>, 33, of <LOCATION>Orlando</LOCATION>, was accustomed to seeing 
manatees swimming in the state's shallow rivers. 
</P>
<P>
But it wasn't until she received an appeal to adopt "Boomer" that she became 
passionately involved in saving the gentle and fragile animals, most of whom 
bear scars from boat propellers. 
</P>
<P>
"If something happened to Boomer, you'd probably find me in tears," she says. 
"As big and, quote, ugly as manatees are, they're beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
Since the <ORGANIZATION>Save The Manatee Club</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Maitland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla.</LOCATION>, began offering adoptions in 
<DATE>1984</DATE>, officials say membership has grown from 800 to 20,000 adults and about 
60,000 students -- 80,000 foster parents in all trying to save a species whose 
population has dwindled to about 1,200. 
</P>
<P>
"Boomer is a manatee who's special to a lot of people now and if something 
happens to <ORGANIZATION>Boomer</ORGANIZATION>, there are a lot of people who are going to be upset," says 
club director <PERSON>Judith Delaney Vallee</PERSON>. "It's now their manatee." 
</P>
<P>
Adoptions have become the lifeblood of many organizations, which have been 
scrambling for funds since many charitable donations were declared no longer 
tax-deductible. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to whale adoptions, the <ORGANIZATION>Massachusetts-based International Wildlife 
Coalition</ORGANIZATION>, which monitors several endangered species, has grown from three 
employees in <DATE>1983</DATE> to 22 now. In the past year, the group sent out 86,000 
humpback whale adoptions for <MONEY>$15</MONEY> each, 50,000 of which were Christmas gifts. 
</P>
<P>
"Our files grow faster than we can keep up with," says coalition official 
<PERSON>Margaret King</PERSON>. "People will send it as a gift to someone else -- it's a great 
stocking stuffer. And it crosses all barriers and countries. We have people in 
<LOCATION>Saudi Arabia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> who have adopted whales." 
</P>
<P>
Sixty-six humpback whales that migrate yearly to the <LOCATION>Cape Cod</LOCATION> area can be 
adopted. Individual whales are identified by unique white and gray marks on 
their tails, so foster parents receive a photograph of their whale's tail as it 
breaches the water.

would be no letup <DATE>Thursday</DATE> in <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>'s heaviest rain since
Hurricane <DATE>Elena three years ago</DATE>.
   ``If they call us, we are ready to respond,'' Guard spokesman
<PERSON>Jerry Vaughn</PERSON> said <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> from headquarters in <LOCATION>St. Augustine</LOCATION>.
   A local state of emergency was declared in <LOCATION>Manatee County</LOCATION> along
the <LOCATION>Manatee River</LOCATION>, which was 7 feet above flood stage late
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME>, and was expected to crest at 11{ feet above
flood stage before <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Red Cross</ORGANIZATION> opened three shelters for residents of south
<LOCATION>Tampa</LOCATION>, where waters lapped at car windshields.
   State officials said they were providing four-wheel-drive
vehicles from the Game and <ORGANIZATION>Fish Commission</ORGANIZATION> to help in the
evacuations, which involved hundreds of homes and at least 1,000
people in <LOCATION>Manatee County</LOCATION>.
   ``One third of the Interbay peninsula is under water,'' said
<PERSON>Edward J. McElroy</PERSON>, acting manager of emergency operations in <LOCATION>Tampa</LOCATION>.
   Divers searched unsuccessfully for a man swept away after a car
carrying four people stalled in a drainage ditch in <LOCATION>Tampa</LOCATION>, then
began to float. The other three people were rescued.
   Witnesses saw <PERSON>James Edward Mercer</PERSON>, 45, surface in the murky
water, his arms flailing, but he was dragged under by the strong
current before rescuers could get to him, said <PERSON>Steve Cole</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Tampa
Police Department</ORGANIZATION> spokesman.
   <LOCATION>Manatee County</LOCATION> schools were shut after several were flooded in
the <LOCATION>Bradenton</LOCATION> area, south of <LOCATION>Tampa</LOCATION>.
   ``The roads are heavily flooded and we're having sewage problems
with water backing up into the schools,'' said superintendent <PERSON>Gene
Witt</PERSON>. ``In the <DATE>last 25 years</DATE> I haven't seen anything of this
magnitude.''
   Almost all low-lying areas were flooded in <LOCATION>Pinellas</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Hillsborough</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pasco</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Sarasota</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Manatee</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Hardee</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Hernando</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Sumter</LOCATION>,
Citrus and Polk counties. Most rivers and streams in those counties
either flooded or were forecast to reach flood stage.
   The rain was from a near-stationary cold front that has been
hovering across the <LOCATION>Florida Peninsula</LOCATION> at the mid-state level,
dumping from 8 to 15 inches of rain, the <ORGANIZATION>National Weather Service</ORGANIZATION>
said.
   Forecasters predicted <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> that 4 more inches could fall
before the front slowly retreats northward.
   In <LOCATION>Tampa</LOCATION>, a homeowner measured more than 12 inches of rain over
two days. Farther north, in <LOCATION>Yankeetown</LOCATION> near Cedar Key, the weather
service reported 13 inches had fallen.
   ``All the rivers around here are over their banks,'' said <ORGANIZATION>Coast
Guard Petty</ORGANIZATION> Officer <PERSON>Eric Hermann</PERSON> in the <LOCATION>Yankeetown</LOCATION> station.
``There's a lot of street flooding and stuff.''
   Yankeetown holds the national record for 24-hour rainfall of
38.7 inches on <DATE>Sept. 5-6, 1950</DATE>.
   Meanwhile, in <LOCATION>northeast Florida</LOCATION>, about 20 families were
evacuated from their homes after two days of heavy rain caused
<ORGANIZATION>Black Creek</ORGANIZATION> to spill over its banks into nearby homes in <LOCATION>Clay
County</LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION>Red Cross</ORGANIZATION> brought food and coffee to the <LOCATION>Middleburg</LOCATION>
Fire Department for those forced from their homes, but most found
refuge with relatives and friends, officials said.

<LOCATION>Turkmenistan</LOCATION> has cut the value of its currency, the manat, to bring the
official and unofficial rates closer together. The new rate, announced on
<DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, of 230 manats to the dollar, cuts the rate from the previous
official rate of 10 to the dollar and commercial rate of 75 to the dollar.
The manat, one of the weakest of the new currencies in spite of
<LOCATION>Turkmenistan</LOCATION>'s huge reserves of natural gas, has been devalued by over 90
per cent in stages. The average wage in <LOCATION>Turkmenistan</LOCATION> is 1,000 manats a
month, though most staples and services are subsidised to very low prices.

  [Text] <LOCATION>Turkmenistan</LOCATION> has introduced, starting with <DATE>May</DATE>, a 
special commercial rate of exchange for its national currency, 
the manat, at which banks will carry out transactions with 
individuals. 
  The rate will be 60 manats per dollar, while the official 
rate is 10 per dollar, and is expected to stay until further 
notice by the <ORGANIZATION>Central Bank</ORGANIZATION>. Meanwhile, the street value of the 
dollar in <LOCATION>Ashkhabad</LOCATION> is 90 to 95 manats. 
  All banks are allowed to buy hard currency at that 
commercial 
rate. The country's Vneshekonombank (foreign economic bank) and 
the joint stock commercial bank <LOCATION>Turkmenistan</LOCATION> have a right to 
exchange manats for dollars at this rate for <LOCATION>Turkmenistan</LOCATION> 
citizens go abroad while the Investbank will sell hard currency 
to individuals in cashless transactions to enable them to pay 
for cargo transportation abroad. The banks will not handle 
transactions with individuals involving more than 500 dlrs. 
  In mid-March the manat was devalued from 1.99 to 10 per 
dollar. Simultaneously the government announced its intention to 
introduce a floating rate of exchange which was to be dictated 
by the prices at the country's inter-bank exchange. Following 
the first trading on 14 <DATE>March 1994</DATE>, when the banks sold 150,000 
dlrs at a rate of 10 manats the exchange was suspended and the 
official rate stayed invariable despite the <PERCENT>30 percent</PERCENT> monthly 
inflation rate.

  [Text] As we reported already, <LOCATION>Turkmenistan</LOCATION> stopped 
supplying gas to <LOCATION>Azerbaijan</LOCATION> as of <DATE>1130</DATE> yesterday. 
  [Begin correspondent Nermine Elikhanbeyli recording] After 
having received many warnings, <LOCATION>Azerbaijan</LOCATION> has finally faced the 
facts. Turkmenistan stopped the natural gas supply to our 
Republic because it wasn't paid for. 
  An Azerbaijani delegation visited <LOCATION>Turkmenistan</LOCATION> and concluded 
an interstate agreement in <DATE>February this year</DATE> envisaging the 
supply of <MONEY>3 billion</MONEY> cubic meters of gas for <DATE>1994</DATE>. During the 
<DATE>first quarter</DATE> of the year, some <MONEY>$50 million</MONEY> of natural gas was 
supplied. According to a clearing agreement, in exchange for 
the gas, our Republic was supposed to send tools used in the oil 
industry, fuel, cooling equipment condensers, and other 
products. But <LOCATION>Azerbaijan</LOCATION> failed to fulfill its obligation. 
  The state firm Azerigas reported that because the <ORGANIZATION>Republic's 
Council of Ministers</ORGANIZATION> has adopted no relevant decision, the firm 
is unable to obtain credit and the needed goods. The <ORGANIZATION>Council of 
Ministers Finance Department</ORGANIZATION> reported that a relevant draft bill 
is being prepared and will be submitted for the approval of the 
prime minister in the coming days. 
  We must realize that we must unfailingly abide by agreements 
if we want to be seen among the ranks of the respectable states. 
We want to note another aspect of this problem. In <LOCATION>Baku</LOCATION> alone, 
industry owes <MONEY>2 billion manats</MONEY> and households <MONEY>9 million manats</MONEY> 
to Azerigas. Failure to pay for the used gas is compounding 
this problem. 
  We would also like to highlight another factor: With its 
60-million population, neighboring <LOCATION>Turkey</LOCATION> uses only 6 to <MONEY>8 
billion</MONEY> cubic meters of gas per year, whereas <LOCATION>Azerbaijan</LOCATION>'s 7 
million residents use between 12-14 billion cubic meters of gas. 
Apparently, no one can compete with our wastefulness. [end

  [Text] The <ORGANIZATION>National Bank of Azerbaijan</ORGANIZATION> has sharply changed 
the exchange rates of foreign currency with respect to the

exchange rate is more realistic and acceptable under today's

significant changes on the currency black market. He emphasized 
that "more surprises lie in store" with respect to official 
currency exchange rates.

   A storm that triggered floods across central
<LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, causing at least six deaths and the evacuation of 1,000
people, threatened homes and lives as it headed north today,
officials said.
   ``Tampa should be breaking out of the rain ... but north of
<LOCATION>Tampa</LOCATION> they could still get some pretty substantial rain,'' <ORGANIZATION>National
Weather Service</ORGANIZATION> meteorologist <PERSON>Randy Lascody</PERSON> said in <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>.
   The storm has swamped the <ORGANIZATION>Gulf Coast</ORGANIZATION> with up to 15 inches of
rain since <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, causing more than <MONEY>$1 million</MONEY> in damage in
hard-hit <LOCATION>Manatee County</LOCATION>, where a state of emergency was in effect.
   The weather service issued a flash-flood watch for <ORGANIZATION>Gulf</ORGANIZATION> and
<PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> counties in the <LOCATION>Florida Panhandle</LOCATION>.
   A wave of showers moving north from the <LOCATION>Gulf of Mexico</LOCATION> was
expected to settle over northern <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> and southern <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION> by
tonight, <PERSON>Lascody</PERSON> said, adding that ``the real heavy stuff'' should
be heading up the southern <LOCATION>Atlantic Coast</LOCATION>.
   Gov. <PERSON>Bob Martinez</PERSON> was to tour the stricken <LOCATION>Bradenton</LOCATION> area of
<LOCATION>Manatee County</LOCATION> by <ORGANIZATION>Florida Air National Guard</ORGANIZATION> helicopter today to
decide whether the area should be declared eligible for state
disaster relief money.
   The rising waters left two dead on the west coast. A 44-year-old
<ORGANIZATION>Tampa</ORGANIZATION> man was presumed drowned after his car plunged into a ditch
and he was sucked into a pipe near downtown <LOCATION>Tampa</LOCATION>. In <LOCATION>New Port
Richey</LOCATION>, a 2-year-old boy drowned in a rain-swollen canal.
   The storm also contributed to a small plane crash <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> that
killed all four aboard near <LOCATION>Williston</LOCATION> about 110 miles north of
<LOCATION>Tampa</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>National Transportation Safety Board</ORGANIZATION> investigator <PERSON>Ron Bird</PERSON>
said <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   The rainfall far surpassed the 5 inches dumped by <ORGANIZATION>Hurricane
Elena on Labor</ORGANIZATION> <DATE>Day 1985</DATE>, when wind and high tides did <MONEY>$9 million</MONEY>
damage and sent 13,000 people to shelters.
   In <LOCATION>St. Petersburg</LOCATION>, hundreds of mostly elderly residents
mistakenly thought the latest flooding was a hurricane.
   ``This is insane,'' <ORGANIZATION>Pinellas County Emergency Management</ORGANIZATION>
director <PERSON>David Bilodeau</PERSON> said. ``There's just been gross panic for
no reason at all.''
   A tornado struck <LOCATION>St. Petersburg</LOCATION> <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>, causing more
than <MONEY>$20,000</MONEY> damage to six houses but no injuries, fire officials
said.
   <LOCATION>Manatee County</LOCATION> commissioners allowed half of the 1,000 evacuees
to return home <DATE>Thursday</DATE> as floodwaters began to recede.
   Residents returning home were urged by county public health
officers to disinfect sinks and showers, pitch out any food touched
by flood waters and check wells for broken pipes or flooding.
   Authorities warned about 300 people staying in shelters <DATE>Thursday</DATE>
to wait one more day while emergency officials tried to resolve
problems with raw sewage, water 5 feet deep in homes along the
<LOCATION>Manatee River</LOCATION> and power failures in homes with standing water.

the revised forecast of social-economic development for <DATE>1994</DATE> to 
the <ORGANIZATION>Ministry of Finance</ORGANIZATION>. 
  By the <ORGANIZATION>Milli Majlis</ORGANIZATION> proposal, this forecast has to be used 
by 
the <ORGANIZATION>Ministry of Finance</ORGANIZATION> to correct the budget draft. 
  According to the forecast, the inflation in <DATE>1994</DATE> reaches <PERCENT>600 
percent</PERCENT>. The first option outlined <PERCENT>240 percent</PERCENT> inflation. 
  A <ORGANIZATION>Finance Ministry</ORGANIZATION> official told that his department does 
not 
accept the projected inflation level as inadequate to the real 
economic situation. Only during the <DATE>first quarter</DATE> of the 
current year, the inflation exceeded <PERCENT>300 percent</PERCENT>, while the 
production output reduced for <PERCENT>25 percent</PERCENT>. 
  On the basis of 600-percent level, the <ORGANIZATION>Economy Ministry</ORGANIZATION> 
expects the GNP at amount of <MONEY>910 billion manats</MONEY>, and national 
income of <MONEY>677 billion manats</MONEY>. The initial forecast gave

  A conference with participation of the <ORGANIZATION>Milli Majlis</ORGANIZATION>

  There was discussed the economic prognosis for <DATE>1994</DATE>,

because of its "unreality." The prognoses on the inflation rate 
(600 per cent) and the rate of <ORGANIZATION>National</ORGANIZATION> profit rose the greatest

  Meanwhile, the specialists of the <ORGANIZATION>Finance Ministry</ORGANIZATION> forecast 
a

<FÊP=106> [Report by <PERSON>Vladimir Kuleshov</PERSON>: "President S. Niyazov Ready </F>
To Replace His Government Unless the Consumer Market Is Put in 
Order"] 
  [Text] <LOCATION>Ashkhabad</LOCATION> [<LOCATION>Ashgabat</LOCATION>] -- It is a long time since 
viewers tuning into the <LOCATION>Turkmenistan</LOCATION> news have seen the kind of 
dressing down given by President <PERSON>S. Niyazov</PERSON> to ministry and 
department leaders over the abominable state of the consumer 
market. Calling his adjutants [zampred] to attention, the 
Turkmenbashi told them: "All of our slogans and promises are 
worth nothing if store shelves remain empty. People are 
becoming exasperated -- and rightly so. How much longer are you 
going to trade commodities from state resources at market 
prices?!" 
  Store shelves that have been stripped bare and on which you 
will not even find toothpaste, shoe polish, matches, or soap; 
soaring prices at state trade outlets -- not to mention 
commercial kiosks and markets -- even by comparison with those 
in <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION>; the despondent faces of people gloomily wandering 
around the stores with the now-worthless manat -- this, 
IZVESTIYA wrote 18 <DATE>February</DATE> -- this is the situation in 
<LOCATION>Turkmenistan</LOCATION>'s cities, even in the capital. Nor has it changed 
one iota today. The lack of the essential range of commodities 
conntinues, with the very same wildly inflated prices at state 
retail outlets. 
  How can you live if you earn 200-250 manats while a kg of 
meat at the market costs between 35 and 40 manats, a kg of 
potatoes is 10 manats, and a pack of cigarettes anything from 20 
to 30 manats? Who controls all of this here in the <LOCATION>Republic</LOCATION>? 
Indeed, is it under control? In the final analysis, who 
regulates prices? These questions were quite rightly asked at 
the <ORGANIZATION>Cabinet of Ministers</ORGANIZATION> session. 
  Prices are one thing, but the absence of commodities in the 
stores, even those which are produced in <LOCATION>Turkmenistan</LOCATION>, is 
another problem dogging the consumer market. "Why is it that, 
despite the availability of raw materials and labor, production 
of these goods is not increasing?" S. Niyazov exclaimed 
indignantly, turning to his adjutants. "Who sanctions market 
prices for state resources?" 
  By the way, he put these questions to them some <DATE>five months 
ago</DATE>, when the manat was being introduced and when, taking 
advantage of the <ORGANIZATION>Turkmenbashi</ORGANIZATION>'s absence from <LOCATION>Turkmenistan</LOCATION>, 
departments pushed up prices for goods and foodstuffs so that 
people ended up wandering around the stores as if they were in a 
museum. In those early <DATE>October</DATE> days a major dressing down was 
also delivered, but everything was quickly forgotten, and that 
is why today, when returning home from a trip to <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION>, people 
from <LOCATION>Turkmenistan</LOCATION> cram all their free luggage space with 
sausage, cheese, fresh eggs, jam, confectionery, and fruit in 
the Russian capital, because they will not find any such thing 
at state trade outlets in <LOCATION>Turkmenistan</LOCATION>. Those who cannot fly to 
<LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> do "the next best thing": On weekends, thousands of 
people from <LOCATION>Krasnovodsk</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Tashauz</LOCATION>, and <PERSON>Mary</PERSON> come to <LOCATION>Ashkhabad</LOCATION> on 
the local trains and clear out the already impoverished stores, 
despite the exorbitant prices. 
  Giving his adjutants a 10-day breathing space before what is 
left of confidence in the government runs out, the <LOCATION>Turkmenistan</LOCATION> 
president demanded from it concrete, vigorous action to improve 
the consumer market situation and the supply to the population 
first and foremost of foodstuffs, medicines, and vital 
commodities.

<FÊP=106> [Report by Arif Useynov: "Privileges Granted"] </F>
  [Text] <LOCATION>Baku</LOCATION> -- President <PERSON>Geydar Aliyev</PERSON> has signed an edict 
on the liberalization of foreign trade on the territory of the 
Republic of <LOCATION>Azerbaijan</LOCATION>. 
  Henceforth, all restrictions on the export of strategic and 
nonstrategic output by all legal entities observing the law and 
customs and banking procedures are being removed. This will 
primarily make it possible to attract currency from abroad and 
speed up the formation of the republic's currency fund, so 
experts believe. 
  Obviously, this is not a question of total license, because 
a 
special commission will be strictly observing exports. 
  A reliable customs barrier has also been placed in the way 
of 
excesses: It is only possible to export output when its value 
is paid for in hard currency or the relevant banking letter of 
credit provided. The practice of holding of commodity exchanges 
is being introduced -- these will determine the value of output 
destined for export. The role of the national currency -- the 
manat -- is also being strengthened. The exchange rate of the 
manat will be established at currency auctions, which is 
reviving hopes of its convertibility. 
  At the same time as the long-awaited edict, the <ORGANIZATION>Azerbaijani 
Ministry of the Economy</ORGANIZATION> has also published forecasts for foreign 
trade activity for <DATE>1994</DATE>. The commodity turnover will increase 
by almost <MONEY>$297 million</MONEY> and will constitute <MONEY>$727 million</MONEY> by the 
end of the year. Barter deals will have to be given up. Like

<TEXT>
   A virulent form of citrus canker may
have been detected again in a commercial grove in <LOCATION>Central Florida</LOCATION>,
state <ORGANIZATION>Agriculture Commissioner Doyle Conner</ORGANIZATION> announced <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
   The area in <LOCATION>Manatee County</LOCATION> already is under restriction because
of previous discoveries of citrus canker A strain in <DATE>1986</DATE>, the
announcement read.
   The discovery was only the second time the canker has been found
in a commercial <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> grove in recent years.
   State and federal plant pathologists ``are conducting extensive
tests on suspicious samples taken from navel orange, red and pink
grapefruit and <PERSON>Hamlin</PERSON> orange trees,'' said a release by <PERSON>Conner</PERSON>'s
office.
   In the meantime, officials are surveying the area around the
suspect groves to take action if the tests prove positive, <PERSON>Conner</PERSON>
said.
   There was no response to a telephone call to the agriculture
department seeking elaboration on the announcement, which was made
late <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME>.
   After canker was detected in <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> in <DATE>1984</DATE>, federal authorities
declared a temporary embargo on citrus shipments, and the state
burned an estimated 20 million citrus trees. The state has since
been ordered to pay the owners of many of the trees who argued that
agriculture authorities acted too hastily in destroying many groves
not affected by canker
   A meeting of the joint state-federal <ORGANIZATION>Citrus Canker Technical
Advisory Committee</ORGANIZATION> has been called for <DATE>Friday</DATE> in <LOCATION>Palmetto</LOCATION> to
recommend regulatory measures, <PERSON>Conner</PERSON> said.
   The canker tentatively has been identified as the A strain, the
release said.
   ``Considered one of the more virulent strains of the disease, it
can spread rapidly, producing premature fruit drop as well as stem,
fruit and leaf lesions,'' <PERSON>Conner</PERSON> said.
   The A strain was discovered in the <DATE>summer of 1986</DATE> on residential
trees on <LOCATION>Anna Maria Island</LOCATION>, in <LOCATION>St. Petersburg</LOCATION> and in one commercial
grove in <LOCATION>Manatee</LOCATION>. Since those discoveries, movement of citrus in
<LOCATION>Manatee</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pinellas</LOCATION> and Hillsborough counties has been strictly
regulated.
   A total of 3,600 infected trees have been discovered to date in
those areas, <PERSON>Conner</PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
   <LOCATION>Naples</LOCATION>, a 600-pound manatee, made veterinary
history and got a clean bill of health when a portable
electrocardiogram machine and a cellular telephone showed her heart
to be sound.
   <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> was the first time transtelephonic electrocardiography
had been attempted on a manatee. The use of a cellular phone
greatly simplified the procedure, according to <ORGANIZATION>Seaquarium</ORGANIZATION> spokesman
<PERSON>Walt Robshaw</PERSON>.
   ``Otherwise, we would have to hire a crane, put her in a sling
and take her out of the tank,'' he said.
   <PERSON>Dr. Gregory Bossart</PERSON>, a Seaquarium veterinarian, lowered the
water level in the pool, rolled <LOCATION>Naples</LOCATION> over on her back and put the
machine on her chest.
   The EKG signal was transmitted to a laboratory in <LOCATION>Roslyn</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>,
by putting the telephone mouthpiece over the machine. It took less
than two minutes, with results back in about two hours, <PERSON>Robshaw</PERSON>
said.
   ``It took a while to get the results because the lab didn't have
anything to compare it to,'' <PERSON>Robshaw</PERSON> said.
   The EKG was conducted because an earlier examination showed
fluid around <LOCATION>Naples</LOCATION>' heart.
   What's good news for <LOCATION>Naples</LOCATION> may be even better news for pygmy
sperm whales.
   Bossart thinks the process could help discover why the whales
beach themselves. In a study of 18 dead adult whales, <PERSON>Bossart</PERSON> found
that all had died from congestive heart failure.
   He thinks the new process will enable scientists to examine
whales while they are still alive.
   The portable EKG machine is about the size of a television
remote control device, <PERSON>Robshaw</PERSON> said. The cellular phone allows the
unit to be used almost anywhere _ even a manatee pool at <LOCATION>Seaquarium</LOCATION>.

<FÊP=106> [Article by A. Yusifova: "Banks Have Been Audited"] </F>
  [Text] The Main Administration for Banking Control of the 
<ORGANIZATION>National Bank of Azerbaijan</ORGANIZATION> audited 31 commercial and joint 
stock-commercial banks in the <DATE>first quarter of 1994</DATE>. 
  The audits revealed the following shortcomings: To this day 
a 
large amount of indebtedness on loans remains at many commercial 
banks; unlawful increases in banks' statutory fund, failure of 
some joint-stock banks to issue stock, absence of registrations 
by the <ORGANIZATION>Ministry of Finance</ORGANIZATION> of the republic, violations of the 
quota of cash holdings, provision of cash services to customers 
without permission from the <ORGANIZATION>National Bank</ORGANIZATION>, violations of rules 
in the process of accepting customer documents, violations of 
the economic standards of banks, failure to meet compulsory 
reserve requirements, and deficiencies in opening accounts have 
occurred. 
  For the most part the absence of letters of guarantee from 
enterprises which are indebted to the banks, guarantees of 
security for personal property, and other credit guarantees, as 
well as the absence of control over the use of the credit issued 
were the reasons for the violations. 
  Besides, it was noted that the founders of the Naftabank 
commercial bank have contributed to the statutory fund 460,000 
manats out of the funds issued to them as a loan. Five other 
commercial banks have violated the percentage ratio for 
contributing monies to the statutory fund (it should be no 
greater than <PERCENT>12 percent</PERCENT>). Some banks were not adequately 
equipped with security devices. Seventeen banks were fined 
<MONEY>11.049 million manats</MONEY> for failing to comply with compulsory 
reserve requirements. In 728 cases, enterprises did not have 
certificates of registration with the tax inspectorate. Some 178 
enterprises and organizations have not been registered by the 
<ORGANIZATION>Ministry of Justice</ORGANIZATION>.

FT  28 JUL 93 / Currency change puts pressure on republics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA appears to have achieved the main objective of its currency reform:
<PERSON>Mr Viktor Gerashchenko</PERSON>, the central bank governor, said yesterday the forced
exchange of pre-1993 roubles had compelled former Soviet republics still
using the Russian currency to opt in or out of the rouble zone.
He said republics which had remained members of the rouble zone - using
roubles issued by the <ORGANIZATION>Bank of Russia</ORGANIZATION> as their only, or parallel, currency -
had to decide whether to stay in or move out. The net effect seems to be to
have whittled the 'rouble core' down to six.
Before last week's currency upheaval five republics had already left the
zone; the three Baltic states of <LOCATION>Estonia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Latvia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Lithuania</LOCATION>, and
<LOCATION>Kyrgyzstan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Ukraine</LOCATION>. Only the Estonian crown can be described as 'stable'
while the Ukrainian karbovanet has been steadily dropping against the
rouble.
Four more republics have now given notice that they will leave the rouble
zone this year (though in practice these decisions are subject to delay).
Azerbaijan yesterday announced it would leave the zone as soon as possible -
the government has given its central bank two days to work out a mechanism
for withdrawing the rouble and replacing it with the manat - at present a
parallel currency.
<LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION> has said that it will introduce its own currency from <DATE>August</DATE>. It
currently supplies coupons to supplement roubles and the government has said
citizens have one week to swap roubles for coupons, to a limit of
Rbs100,000.
<LOCATION>Moldova</LOCATION> has said it will now introduce coupons for all transactions and will
speed the introduction of the leu, which is being printed in <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION>.
One problem in <LOCATION>Moldova</LOCATION> is its large Russian-speaking minority in the
self-styled TransDnestrian republic who have refused to switch to coupons
and still use the rouble.
<LOCATION>Turkmenistan</LOCATION> is to bring forward the introduction of its manat, from <DATE>January</DATE>
next year to <DATE>October 1993</DATE>. The manat notes and tenge coins are already
arriving in <LOCATION>Ashkhabad</LOCATION>, the Turkmen capital and are likely to be valued at
1:1 with the dollar.
<PERSON>Mr Mukhammed Abalakov</PERSON>, the economics and finance minister, said yesterday
the Russian move was a 'stab in the back' for the other republics, and that
they should have been given at least six months notice.
The remaining six republics, including <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION>, have opted to remain in the
rouble zone, at least for now. <LOCATION>Armenia</LOCATION> has made the most fuss - <PERSON>Mr Levan
Barkhudaryan</PERSON>, the finance minister, said the cash exchange was 'a direct
violation of all previous agreements on currencies' but its economy is in
such a dire state that it can no nothing. <LOCATION>Belarus</LOCATION> has stepped into line, as
it usually does with Russian decisions. Citizens can exchange up to
Rbs50,000, but must put larger amounts in a six month deposit account at an
annual interest rate of 60 per cent. <PERSON>Mr Viktor Danilenko</PERSON>, the <LOCATION>Belarus</LOCATION>
ambassador in <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION>, rebuked the Russian government, saying that they had
dumped a 'railroad car' full of old notes on <LOCATION>Belarus</LOCATION> only a day before the
central bank announcement. He declined to say whether <LOCATION>Belarus</LOCATION> would bring in
its own currency.
<LOCATION>Tajikistan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Uzbekistan</LOCATION> have both said they will fall into line, although
citizens can continue to use the old notes for the time being. <LOCATION>Kazakhstan</LOCATION>,
has said it will withdraw the old notes but it is awaiting a sufficient
quantity of new notes before effecting the switch.

FT  17 AUG 92 / Ukraine's bank chief seeks return to rouble

<LOCATION>UKRAINE</LOCATION> needs a 'tactical retreat' from the coupon, the republic's faltering
quasi-currency, and re-introduction of the Russian rouble, according to <PERSON>Mr
Vadim Hetman</PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>Ukraine National Bank</ORGANIZATION>.
The <ORGANIZATION>National Bank of Ukraine</ORGANIZATION> is emerging as the strongest proponent of
tougher economic policies for the republic, but fears its belt-tightening
measures will be opposed by <PERSON>Mr Vitold Fokin</PERSON>, the prime minister.
The showdown could come in <DATE>September</DATE>, when <PERSON>Mr Hetman</PERSON> plans to present a
tough stabilisation programme to parliament. The struggle will pit the
technocrats at the <ORGANIZATION>National Bank</ORGANIZATION>, who are itching to become members of good
standing in the international banking community, against <PERSON>Mr Fokin</PERSON>'s insular,
Communist-dominated cabinet of ministers, which is struggling to preserve a
command economy.
First introduced in <DATE>January</DATE> as a stop-gap solution to <LOCATION>Ukraine</LOCATION>'s severe
shortage of roubles, the coupon now accounts for 97 per cent of official
cash transactions in <LOCATION>Ukraine</LOCATION>.
However the government's ballooning budget deficit and lax credit policies
have rapidly eroded the value of the coupon from an initial two or three
roubles to the current rate of between 60 and 65 kopeks.
'The state of the coupon is a national tragedy,' <PERSON>Mr Hetman</PERSON> said at an
emotional press conference over the weekend closed to foreign journalists.
'We took a series of provocative acts against the coupon which no currency
in the world could endorse and which no other government in the world could
countenance.'
<PERSON>Mr Hetman</PERSON>, a hard-headed manager who ran <LOCATION>Ukraine</LOCATION>'s largest commercial bank
before moving to the <ORGANIZATION>National Bank</ORGANIZATION> this <DATE>spring</DATE>, outlined a two-part strategy
to rescue the coupon.
In the short-term, <PERSON>Mr Hetman</PERSON> said: 'We must arrange a temporary marriage
with the rouble. This is a tactical retreat.'
In a move piloted in <LOCATION>Crimea</LOCATION> <DATE>last week</DATE>, <PERSON>Mr Hetman</PERSON> would like to re-introduce
the rouble as a parallel currency in mainland <LOCATION>Ukraine</LOCATION>, where state stores
only accept coupons.
In the long term, <PERSON>Mr Hetman</PERSON> wants to restrict the issuing of coupons by
putting a ceiling on wages and severely cutting credits to inefficient state
enterprises.
However, discussions of these proposals late on <DATE>Friday</DATE> with <PERSON>Mr Fokin</PERSON> did not
encourage him. 'The prime minister does not want us to take these steps but
wants us to stick with the old policy,' he said.
<PERSON>Mr Hetman</PERSON> blamed <PERSON>Mr Fokin</PERSON>'s government and the parliament for <LOCATION>Ukraine</LOCATION>'s
runaway inflation.
'The parliament and the government continue to print money and to endorse
increasingly costly programmes, despite the repeated protests of the
<ORGANIZATION>National Bank</ORGANIZATION>,' he said.
<PERSON>Mr Hetman</PERSON> warned that, if the introduction of <LOCATION>Ukraine</LOCATION>'s long-awaited
separate currency, the hryvnia, was to be successful, 'these 'stabilisation'
measures must be implemented by the end of the year.' The final decision on
when to introduce the hryvnia would be taken in <DATE>September</DATE>.
The manner in which several <ORGANIZATION>CIS</ORGANIZATION> members are tinkering with the rouble is
causing growing alarm to the monetary authorities in <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION>, writes <PERSON>John
Thornhill</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION>.
On <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, <LOCATION>Azerbaijan</LOCATION> announced it was to print a new currency, the manat,
to supplement a shortage of roubles circulating in the trans-Caucasian
state. Workers will now receive 20 per cent of their pay in manats. The
Azeri central bank said it would issue three different denominations of
manat bank notes. One manat would be equivalent to 10 roubles.
Other former Soviet republics have also issued parallel currencies, although
only <LOCATION>Estonia</LOCATION> has completely abandoned the rouble-introducing its own kroon.
Many western economists and bankers have argued that a proliferation of
national currencies among the republics of the former <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> will only
hamper trade within the region.
