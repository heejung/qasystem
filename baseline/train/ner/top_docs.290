   After being brushed by several hurricanes this year,
the eastern <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> islands may get the brunt of Hurricane Hugo as
it churns westward with 150 mph winds, forecasters said <DATE>Friday</DATE>.
   ``It looks like this one is not going to miss the islands like
the others,'' said <PERSON>Jack Beven</PERSON>, a forecaster at the <ORGANIZATION>National
Hurricane Center</ORGANIZATION> in suburban <LOCATION>Coral Gables</LOCATION>. ``It's on the most
southerly course of any this year and that should keep it down in
the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> longer.''
   A hurricane warning was posted <DATE>Friday</DATE> from <LOCATION>St. Lucia</LOCATION> to the
<ORGANIZATION>British Virgin Islands</ORGANIZATION>, and a hurricane watch was issued for the
<ORGANIZATION>U.S. Virgin Islands</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION>. A tropical storm watch was
issued for the islands of <LOCATION>Barbados</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>St. Vincent</LOCATION>.
   Rough seas have been reported around the islands since <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   Forecasters described the force four hurricane as ``extremely
dangerous.'' Category five is the scale's highest rank.
   At <TIME>10:30 p.m. EDT</TIME>, Hugo's center was near 14.9 north latitude and
56.6 west longitude, or about 340 miles east southeast of the French
resort island of <LOCATION>Guadeloupe</LOCATION> in the <LOCATION>Leeward Islands</LOCATION>. The storm was
moving west at 15 mph.
   With nothing in the atmosphere to divert it or sap its power,
Hugo was expected to remain on its westerly course and strengthen
somewhat during the next 24 hours, according to reports from an <ORGANIZATION>Air
Force</ORGANIZATION> reconnaissance plane.
   <PERSON>Beven</PERSON> said the center of the system could reach the <LOCATION>Leeward
Islands</LOCATION> on <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> and may move toward <LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION> over the
weekend. Rainfall amounts of five to 10 inches is expected in the
path of the hurricane.
   Three other hurricanes this year _ Dean, <PERSON>Erin</PERSON> and <PERSON>Gabrielle</PERSON> _
turned north toward <LOCATION>Bermuda</LOCATION> before reaching the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION>.
   But Hugo's southern course is reminiscent of Hurricane Gilbert,
which pounded <LOCATION>Jamaica</LOCATION> and the Mexican mainland <DATE>last September</DATE>. Hugo
was upgraded <DATE>Friday</DATE> to a force 4 storm. Gilbert was a 5, the scale's
highest rank.
   Hugo is the eighth named storm of the present <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> hurricane
season, which runs from <DATE>June 1</DATE> to <DATE>Nov. 30</DATE>. Tropical storms have
maximum sustained winds of 39 mph, and reach hurricane status when
winds reach 74 mph.

   A hurricane watch was posted in the eastern
<LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> <DATE>today</DATE> as Hurricane Hugo churned westward with winds of 125
mph and some stregthening predicted, forecasters said.
   The hurricane watch was posted from <LOCATION>St. Lucia</LOCATION> to the <ORGANIZATION>British
Virgin Islands</ORGANIZATION>, and a tropical storm watch was issued for the
islands of <LOCATION>Barbados</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>St. Vincent</LOCATION>, according to the <ORGANIZATION>National
Hurricane Center</ORGANIZATION> in suburban <LOCATION>Coral Gables</LOCATION>.
   ``The fringe effects of the storm are already being felt,'' said
forecaster <PERSON>Gil Clark</PERSON>. ``The seas are already getting rough off the
islands because of swells emanating off the storm.''
   At noon <ORGANIZATION>EDT</ORGANIZATION>, Hugo's center was located near 14.4 north latitude
and 54.1 west longitude, or about 500 miles east southeast of
<LOCATION>Guadeloupe</LOCATION> in the <LOCATION>Leeward Islands</LOCATION>. The storm was moving west at 15
mph, down from a peak of 20 mph <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>.
   ``The only way it's going to miss those islands is it's going to
have to swerve northward,'' <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> said.
   He added that forecasters saw no indications Hugo would turn that
way. ``We've been lucky this year. We've had two or three storms
head toward the islands and then turn north. Maybe we'll get lucky
again but it doesn't look like it in ths case.''
   Three of this season's <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> hurricanes _ Dean, <PERSON>Erin</PERSON> and
<PERSON>Gabrielle</PERSON> _ turned north into the open <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> before reaching the
<LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION>, forecaster <PERSON>Hal Gerrish</PERSON> said.
   Last year, killer Hurricane Gilbert held the westward course,
pounding <LOCATION>Jamaica</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>.
   Hugo developed quickly into a major storm. Its highest sustained
winds rose by more than 35 mph <DATE>Thursday</DATE> alone and were estimated at
120 mph <TIME>this morning</TIME>, inching up to 125 mph at noon.
   ``It really was amazing how fast the eye formed and it almost
doubled its winds,'' <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> said. Conditions favored the hurricane's
strengthening today; forecasters expected no change in its motion.
   Hugo's winds classify it as a 3 on the Saffir-Simpson scale, a
sort of Richter scale for storms. Gilbert, the strongest hurricane
on record, was a 5 _ the scale's highest rank.
   A reconnaissance plane was to be dispatched to investigate the
storm, <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> said.
   Hugo is the eighth named storm of the <DATE>1989</DATE> Atlantic hurricane
season. Tropical storms have sustained winds of 39 mph, and reach
hurricane status when winds hit 74 mph.

   Forecasters consulted computers, satellites and
yellowing hurricane charts <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> in a frantic effort to plot the
course of Hurricane Hugo, which might hit the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> this
<DATE>weekend</DATE>.
   Then again, it might not.
   ``When you look out two to three days in the future, that's when
we have our most difficult problems,'' said <PERSON>Bob Sheets</PERSON>, director of
the <ORGANIZATION>National Hurricane Center</ORGANIZATION> in suburban <LOCATION>Coral Gables</LOCATION>. ``We have a
lot of different things going on.''
   Forecasters said <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> residents from the <LOCATION>Florida Keys</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>North
Carolina</LOCATION> should watch Hugo's uncertain path carefully. The
hurricane, leaving devastation behind in the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION>, was moving
past the <LOCATION>Bahamas</LOCATION> and could affect <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> by <DATE>Friday</DATE>, forecasters
said.
   They added, however, that it could also miss the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>
entirely.
   A variety of weather factors, some as far away as <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> and the
<LOCATION>Rocky Mountains</LOCATION>, could determine Hugo's course. But the most likely
effect will come from the combination of a low-pressure system
moving west across southern <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION> and a broad high-pressure ridge,
the ``Bermuda High,'' to Hugo's north.
   The high-pressure system probably will block Hugo from spinning
harmlessly out into the <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION>, as Hurricane <PERSON>Gabrielle</PERSON> did last
week, forecasters said, while the low-pressure system could lure
Hugo westward.
   Forecasters said the varying factors also would affect the
storm's strength, which was slowly rebuilding <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> after falling
from 140 mph winds to 105 mph.
   Forecasters watched data spit out of advanced computers, studied
satellite maps and reconnaissance photos flown back on <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION>
``hurricane hunter'' planes, and even pulled out old hurricane
charts to see what storms similar to Hugo have done.
   ``We were just looking through a bunch of the old charts,''
Sheets said. ``They've done everything. They've done loopity-loops,
they've gone into south <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, they've gone into central <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>,
all the way up to the <LOCATION>Carolinas</LOCATION>.''
   An <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> reconnaissance crew that flew into Hugo <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> said
the eye was about 30 to 40 miles across and the pressure had risen
to about 965 millibars _ a sign of weakening.
   ``It's weaker than in the past few days, but it's still a
significant hurricane,'' said <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> Capt. <PERSON>Dave Carlisle</PERSON>.
   Hurricane <PERSON>David</PERSON>, a destructive hurricane that hit eastern
<LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> islands 10 years ago, swept past <LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION>, hit the
island of <LOCATION>Hispaniola</LOCATION>, moved through the western <LOCATION>Bahamas</LOCATION>, then made
landfall on <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>'s middle east coast.
   So far, <PERSON>Hugo</PERSON> has moved from the eastern <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> across <LOCATION>Puerto
Rico</LOCATION>, then away from <LOCATION>Hispaniola</LOCATION> and was headed slightly east of the
<LOCATION>Bahamas</LOCATION>.
   Computer models that use all available weather data, past records
and physics equations were laying out conflicting futures for Hugo,
Sheets said.
   The best advice forecasters could offer, Sheets said, was for
coastal residents across the southeastern <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> to be ready.

<TEXT>
   Hugo's trek across the <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> toward the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION>
slowed today, the storm's 75 mph winds just barely qualifying it as
a hurricane.
   At <TIME>6 a.m. EDT</TIME>, Hugo's center was located near 13.0 north latitude
and 48.0 west longitude, or about 900 miles east of the Lesser
Antilles. The storm was moving west at 17 mph, down from 20 mph
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>.
   Its highest sustained winds were just over the 74 mph hurricane
threshold, but the storm was expected to strengthen, forecasters
said. Hugo was expected to hold its course today.
   ``The threat to the islands is kind of delayed some,'' said
forecaster <PERSON>Gil Clark</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>National Hurricane Center</ORGANIZATION> in suburban
<LOCATION>Coral Gables</LOCATION>. ``A lot of our model forecasts indicate it's going to
slow down even more in the next couple of days.''
   Hugo, the eighth named storm of the <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> hurricane season,
developed into a hurricane <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>evening</TIME>. Storms are given names
when their sustained winds reach 39 mph, the tropical storm
threshold.
   ``The longer it heads west, the more concern it is to us,'' said
<PERSON>Hal Gerrish</PERSON>, a forecaster at the hurricane center. ``But we're not
sure yet where it will go _ there are too many things that can
happen.''
   The three <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> hurricanes before <PERSON>Hugo _ Dean</PERSON>, <PERSON>Erin</PERSON> and
<PERSON>Gabrielle</PERSON> _ turned north into the open <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> before reaching the
<LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION>. But last year's killer Hurricane Gilbert remained on the
westward course, socking <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION>.
   They became storms when sustained winds reached 39 mph, and reach
hurricanes status when winds hit 74 mph.

   Hurricane Hugo, the most powerful storm to hit the
northeastern <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> in a decade, was bearing down on the <LOCATION>Leeward
Islands</LOCATION> <DATE>today</DATE> with 140 mph winds and a 10-foot wall of water.
   ``This is an extremely dangerous hurricane,'' hurricane
specialist <PERSON>Max Mayfield</PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION>National Hurricane Center</ORGANIZATION> in suburban
<LOCATION>Coral Gables</LOCATION> said. ``This is stonger than Hurricane <PERSON>David</PERSON> back in
<DATE>1979</DATE>,'' which left 1,200 dead in the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>.
   At <TIME>noon EDT</TIME> <DATE>today</DATE>, Hugo's center near 15.6 north latitude and
59.0 west longitude, or about 175 miles east-southeast of the French
resort island of <LOCATION>Guadeloupe</LOCATION> in the <LOCATION>Leeward Islands</LOCATION>. It was expected
to hit the island this afternoon or tonight, said forecaster <PERSON>Martin
Nelson</PERSON>, before moving in the direction of <LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION>.
   The hurricane was moving west at 14 mph, sending showers and
gusty winds to the eastern edge of the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION>.
   The storm's strength flucutated <TIME>this morning</TIME>, dipping from 150
mph at <TIME>6 a.m.</TIME> to 140 mph at <TIME>9 a.m</TIME>. It was expected to continue to do
so as the size of the eye contracts and expands, forecasters said,
but storm-force winds of 39 mph and above extend 150 miles from the
center.
   In <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Air France</ORGANIZATION> announced it was canceling all three of its
flights scheduled today to <LOCATION>Martinique</LOCATION> because of the storm.
Miami-based <ORGANIZATION>Eastern Airlines</ORGANIZATION> planned no cancellations or reroutings
today, but spokesman <PERSON>Robin Matell</PERSON> said, ``We'll keep monitoring it
very closely.''
   Forecasters won't be able to tell for five or six days whether
Hugo will hit the coastal <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, forecaster <PERSON>Jim Gross</PERSON> said.
   A hurricane warning was posted from <LOCATION>St. Lucia</LOCATION> north to <LOCATION>St. Martin</LOCATION>
including the <ORGANIZATION>British Virgin Islands</ORGANIZATION>, and a hurricane watch the <LOCATION>U.S.
Virgin Islands</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION> may be upgraded to a warning today. A
tropical storm watch was in effect for the islands of <LOCATION>Barbados</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>St. Vincent</LOCATION>, according to the hurricane center.
   Forecasters classed the hurricane in Category 4, meaning it is
considered capable of extreme damage. If its sustained winds grow to
155 mph, it would be classified in Category 5, capable of
catastrophic damage. Only two Category 5 hurricanes have hit the
<LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> since record-keeping began; the latest, <PERSON>Camille</PERSON> in
<DATE>1969</DATE>, killed 256 people.
   Islanders were warned to expect rainfall amounts of 5 to 10
inches and a storm surge with waves 10 feet higher than normal.
   <LOCATION>Dominica</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Guadeloupe</LOCATION>'s closest neighbor to the south, has only
recently recovered from the destruction <PERSON>David</PERSON> wrought 10 years ago,
when floods and mud slides poured down from mountains onto coastal
towns and villages.
   On <LOCATION>Martinique</LOCATION>, the next island in the chain, school officials
canceled classes today.
   A disaster response team from <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Metro Dade Fire Department</ORGANIZATION>
established a communications center in <LOCATION>Barbados</LOCATION>, about 200 miles
south of Hugo's path, to assess damage and coordinate emergency
medical treatment throughout the <LOCATION>Leeward Islands</LOCATION>.
   At the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Coast Guard</ORGANIZATION> station in <LOCATION>San Juan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION>,
guardsmen were preparing for the storm <DATE>Friday</DATE>.
   ``You go around and police the area and pick up anything that can
become a missile hazard,'' Petty Officer <PERSON>Alan Burd</PERSON> said.
   The island chain has escaped the worst of previous hurricanes
this year. Dean, <PERSON>Erin</PERSON> and <PERSON>Gabrielle</PERSON> turned north toward <LOCATION>Bermuda</LOCATION>
before reaching the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION>. This time, there were no signs of the
lowering atmospheric pressure that veered the others away.
   Hugo is the eighth named storm of the current <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> hurricane
season, which runs from <DATE>June 1</DATE> to <DATE>Nov. 30</DATE>. Tropical storms have
maximum sustained winds of 39 mph and reach hurricane status when
winds reach 74 mph.

   Hurricane Hugo spun toward the
<LOCATION>Bahamas</LOCATION> today after thrashing <LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION> with 125 mph winds,
leaving more than 50,000 people homeless throughout the eastern
<LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION>. An official reported at least 25 dead.
   Hugo hit northeastern <LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION> and then skirted its populous
northern coast on <DATE>Monday</DATE>. It roared on to the northwest and toward
open water, its hurricane-force winds missing the <LOCATION>Dominican Republic</LOCATION>.
   At <TIME>noon EDT</TIME> <DATE>today</DATE>, the hurricane's center was near latitude 22.2
degrees north and longitude 68.5 west, about 175 miles east
northeast of <LOCATION>Grand Turk Island</LOCATION> in the southern <LOCATION>Bahamas</LOCATION>, according to
the <ORGANIZATION>National Weather Service</ORGANIZATION>. Winds fell to 105 mph.
   Forecasters said it likely would hit the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> mainland later in
the week but said it was too early to predict where. Cruise ships
steamed out of the way, residents prepared along the <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION>
coast and <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> residents jammed the phone lines of insurance
companies for financial protection.
   ``It's a long way from any potential landfall,'' said <PERSON>Bob Sheets</PERSON>,
director of the <ORGANIZATION>National Hurricane Center</ORGANIZATION> in suburban <LOCATION>Coral Gables</LOCATION>.
``Unfortunately, the higher likelihood is that it will turn more
west and could make landfall anywhere from <LOCATION>South Florida</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>North
Carolina</LOCATION>.''
   At least 25 people in the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> died from the storm, said
<PERSON>Cizanette Rivera</PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION>Civil Defense</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Maria Dolores Oronoz</PERSON>, a spokesman for Gov. <PERSON>Rafael
Hernandez-Colon</PERSON>, said only two people died on <LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION>. The two
died while trying to remove a TV antenna <DATE>Sunday</DATE> in preparation for
the storm, she said. She said no other deaths had been reported in
<LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>National Weather Service</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>San Juan</LOCATION> reported its preliminary
statement that said 25 had died on the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> commonwealth was
incorrect.
   <PERSON>Ms. Rivera</PERSON> gave no breakdown on where the other reported victims
had died, but scattered fatalities were reported throughout the
heavily visited tourist islands of the eastern <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION>.
   Hugo left a trail of smashed homes, power failures and injuries
in <LOCATION>Guadeloupe</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Montserrat</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Antigua</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Virgin Islands</LOCATION> since
<DATE>Sunday</DATE>, and widespread looting by machete-wielding mobs was reported
on the island of <LOCATION>St. Thomas</LOCATION> in the <LOCATION>U.S. Virgin Islands</LOCATION>.
   Widespread evacuations apparently lessened the chance of
fatalities.
   Sailboats were blown out of the water and thrown up to 150 feet
on shore in <LOCATION>St. Thomas</LOCATION>, and some waterfront businesses have
disappeared.
   ``We were all huddled together in the corridor when the wind took
off the roof of the house,'' said 14-year-old <PERSON>Didier Gacoby-Kaoly</PERSON> of
<LOCATION>Guadeloupe</LOCATION>.
   Cleanup efforts were under way today throughout <LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION>. Gov.
<PERSON>Rafael Hernandez-Colon</PERSON> said at least 27,900 people were left
homeless and asked President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> to declare it a disaster area.
   Hugo's winds overturned cars, peeled roofs off houses and office
buildings and sent chunks of concrete plunging into streets in <LOCATION>San
Juan</LOCATION>, where one-third of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> commonwealth's 3.3 million people
live.
   The winds ripped out glass, walls and furnishings from the top
four floors of a 25-story building in the <LOCATION>Santurce</LOCATION> section, leaving
only beams remaining.
   Fifty airplanes were reported destroyed at the airport in <LOCATION>Isla
Verde</LOCATION>. Looters stripped shops of their goods in <LOCATION>San Juan</LOCATION>.
   Officials were working to restore power, which was cut to <PERCENT>75
percent</PERCENT> of the island.
   Police cars with flashing lights patrolled <LOCATION>San Juan</LOCATION> streets early
today. Major streets were cleared, but secondary streets remained
clogged with power lines, tree limbs, sheets of metal and shattered
glass.
   Flooding made many roads impassable, and international
communications were disrupted.
   In the northeast town of <LOCATION>Luquillo</LOCATION>, 10 homes were swept downriver
and six families were reported missing, the weather service office
said.
   <ORGANIZATION>Civil Defense</ORGANIZATION> officials reported <PERCENT>80 percent</PERCENT> of the homes on the
<LOCATION>Puerto Rican</LOCATION> islands of <LOCATION>Vieques</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Culebra</LOCATION> were were either
destroyed or damaged.
   Secretary of the Interior <PERSON>Manuel Lujan</PERSON> said <MONEY>$500,000</MONEY> in emergency
assistance funds were released to aid storm-stricken areas of <LOCATION>Puerto
Rico</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>U.S. Virgin Islands</LOCATION>.
   The weather service said maximum sustained winds had slowed to
near 105 mph with hurricane-force winds extending up to 60 miles
from the center. It was moving to the northwest at 12 mph and was
expected to continue in that direction during the next 24 hours.
   A hurricane watch was in effect for the central <LOCATION>Bahamas</LOCATION> and
tropical storm warnings for the southern <LOCATION>Bahamas</LOCATION>.
   Since <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, the storm has caused widespread damage in
<LOCATION>Guadeloupe</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Antigua</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>St. Kitts</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Montserrat</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>British
Virgin Islands</ORGANIZATION>.
   Six people were killed and hundreds of buildings were flattened
on the British island of <LOCATION>Montserrat</LOCATION>, the British government said
<DATE>today</DATE>. It said nearly all of the 12,000 island residents were
homeless.
   Britain reported the <ORGANIZATION>Royal Navy</ORGANIZATION> marines landed on <LOCATION>Montserrat</LOCATION> to
help clear the airport runway so planes could deliver aid supplies.
British Overseas Aid Minister <PERSON>Lynda Chalker</PERSON> said <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> would
provide <MONEY>$1.57 million</MONEY> in emergency aid to islands struck by the
hurricane.
   Five people were reported killed, 84 injured and about 15,000
homeless on the French island of <LOCATION>Guadeloupe</LOCATION>. Two were killed in
<LOCATION>Antigua</LOCATION>.
   In <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>French Defense Ministry</ORGANIZATION> assigned 3,000 soldiers,
two military transport aircraft and four cargo vessels to assist in
restoring communications and emergency services to <LOCATION>Guadeloupe</LOCATION>.
French President <PERSON>Francois Mitterrand</PERSON> pledged to rebuild ``what was
destroyed.''
   Most of the <LOCATION>Virgin Islands</LOCATION>' 106,000 residents live on <LOCATION>St. Thomas</LOCATION>
and <LOCATION>St. Croix</LOCATION>, where a ham radio operator said winds had torn off
the roofs of up to <PERCENT>75 percent</PERCENT> of the homes.
   Hugo is the fourth hurricane of the <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> hurricane season and
is the most powerful hurricane to hit the region since Hurricane
David in <DATE>1979</DATE>.
   That storm killed an estimated 1,200 people in the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>.
   Tropical Storm Iris rose in the wake of Hugo and forecasters
advised residents of the battered <LOCATION>Leeward Islands</LOCATION> to keep a close
watch on the new storm. They said <PERSON>Iris</PERSON>, with 50 mph winds, was about
300 miles east of the <LOCATION>Leeward Islands</LOCATION> <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> and was moving
north-northwest at about 18 mph.

   Tropical Storm Iris gathered 50 mph winds in the
wake of Hurricane Hugo on <DATE>Monday</DATE> and forecasters warned residents on
the already battered <LOCATION>Leeward Islands</LOCATION> to keep a close watch on its
progress.
   At <TIME>6 p.m. EDT</TIME> <DATE>Monday</DATE>, a <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Air Force</ORGANIZATION> reconnaissance aircraft
and satellite pictures located the center of the tropical storm near
16.5 north latitude and 56.5 west longitude, or about 300 miles east
of the <LOCATION>Leeward Islands</LOCATION>, a group of islands in the Lesser Antilles of
the <LOCATION>West Indies</LOCATION>.
   The governments of <LOCATION>Barbados</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>St. Vincent</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>St. Lucia</LOCATION> issued
warnings for <ORGANIZATION>Iris</ORGANIZATION>, the ninth named storm of this <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> hurricane
season.
   Forecasters at the <ORGANIZATION>National Hurricane Center</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Coral Gables</LOCATION> said
<PERSON>Iris</PERSON> was moving toward the north-northwest at about 18 mph.
   Swirling weather patterns left behind by Hugo made further
strengthening unlikely through <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> <TIME>evening</TIME>, said hurricane
specialist <PERSON>Gil Clark</PERSON>. Iris was expected to hold its course at a
slightly slower pace during that time.
   Tropical depressions become tropical storms when their top
sustained winds reach 39 mph. Iris became a storm <DATE>Sunday</DATE>.

   Forecasters <DATE>today</DATE> said deadly Hurricane Hugo could
hit anywhere from <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION> <DATE>this weekend</DATE> _ or spin
harmlessly away in the <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION>.
   ``It's a long way from any potential landfall,'' said <PERSON>Bob Sheets</PERSON>,
director of the <ORGANIZATION>National Hurricane Center</ORGANIZATION> in suburban <LOCATION>Coral Gables</LOCATION>.
``Unfortunately, the higher likelihood is that it will turn more
west and could make landfall anywhere from <LOCATION>South Florida</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>North
Carolina</LOCATION>.''
   Sheets added, though, that it's also possible the hurricane could
skirt the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> entirely.
   Forecasters today watched data spit out of computers, studied
satellite maps and reconnaissance photos flown back on <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION>
``hurricane hunter'' planes, and even pulled out old hurricane
charts to see what storms similar to Hugo have done.
   The data laid out conflicting futures for Hugo, Sheets said.
   ``We were just looking through a bunch of the old charts,'' he
said. ``They've done everything. They've done loopity-loops, they've
gone into <LOCATION>South Florida</LOCATION>, they've gone into central <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, all the
way up to the <LOCATION>Carolinas</LOCATION>.''
   The main area of agreement on the computer models, Sheets said,
was that Hugo is likely to change from the north-northwest course it
followed overnight after pounding <LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION>.
   ``Now the question is when is it going to turn more
west-northwest,'' Sheets said. ``There's just not any way to say.''
   Hurricanes are propelled by prevailing winds generated by other
weather systems.
   The most likely impact on Hugo will be a ``Bermuda High,'' a
high-pressure system building to Hugo's northeast, forecasters said.
That system would tend to keep Hugo from veering from the <LOCATION>East Coast</LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
   After flying into about 200 hurricanes,
<PERSON>Bob Sheets</PERSON> doesn't appear at all fazed by his responsibility as
director of the <ORGANIZATION>National Hurricane Center</ORGANIZATION> to predict the path of the
ferocious storms.
   Sheets, 52, friendly and low-key, is in his third season as head
of the worldwide command center for hurricane data in this suburb of
<LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>.
   ``You look out there and see the chaos ... but it really works,''
he said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> while surveying the low-ceiling, wide-open room
jammed with forecasters and reporters, cameramen and photographers
covering Hurricane Hugo.
   Hugo, whose winds dropped to 105 mph after churning through the
<LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION>, is the most powerful of nine named storms this year, six
of which became hurricanes. Storms like Hugo make Sheets a household
name.
   Killer hurricanes like Hugo, which left at least 25 dead, tens of
thousands homeless and <MONEY>millions of dollars</MONEY> in damages in its rampage
through the eastern <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION>, make Sheets a household name when
they threaten the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> mainland.
   A typical half hour for Sheets: do live feeds for the networks
and local television stations; squeeze in a few minutes with a print
reporter; grab a phone to talk with a government official in <LOCATION>Myrtle
Beach</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>S.C.</LOCATION>; consult with his team of forecasters on incoming data.
   Then it starts all over again.
   ``He's a cool, collected person _ the ideal person for this
pressure job,'' said <PERSON>Gil Clark</PERSON>, a 34-year veteran of the hurricane
center. ``He's got a real feeling for hurricanes and everything that
goes with it.''
   Sheets also gets high marks from his colleagues for scientific
ability and poise.
   ``He worked here as a forecaster before becoming deputy director
and then director,'' said hurricane specialist <PERSON>Hal Gerrish</PERSON>. ``He's
not just an administrator. He can sit down and be able to pull one
of the shifts with us.''
   One of the biggest pressures on Sheets is to pinpoint where a
hurricane will blast ashore _ a decision that can result in
evacuations and huge expenditures. It is one of his biggest
frustrations.
   ``It's frustrating not to be able to say with a great deal of
confidence this is where it's going to move,'' said Sheets.
   Hugo has been an especially difficult storm to forecast beyond a
couple of days, but he said the devastation in the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> had
been lessened because of forecasts and warnings issued by the center.
   Sheets, in 16 years of research flights, had his share of close
calls flying into the eye of hurricanes. He says he finds his
current job very fulfilling despite offers to join reconnaissance
crews checking Hugo.
   ``There's nothing there that I need to go and experience again,''
he said, grinning.

<TEXT>
   The <DATE>1989</DATE> hurricane season, marked by the costliest
storm in <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> history, officially ended today with yet another
tropical storm forming in the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION>.
   At <TIME>8 a.m. EST</TIME>, <ORGANIZATION>Tropical Storm Karen</ORGANIZATION>, with 50 mph winds, was
about 125 miles south-southwest of <LOCATION>Havana</LOCATION> and was not expected to
strengthen, said the <ORGANIZATION>National Hurricane Center</ORGANIZATION> in suburban <LOCATION>Coral
Gables</LOCATION>. It was drifttng toward <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION> at about 5 mph.
   Depressions become named storms when their sustained winds reach
39 mph; hurricanes have winds of at least 74 mph. <PERSON>Karen</PERSON> is the 11th
named storm of the season, which began <DATE>June 1</DATE>.
   The six-month season was far less deadly than <DATE>1988</DATE>'s, in which
550 people died in storms.
   This year's storms killed 84 people, including 56 in the <LOCATION>United
States</LOCATION>, said meteorologist <PERSON>Mark Zimmer</PERSON>. Hurricane Hugo was blamed
for 49 deaths, including 21 in this country. It slammed into <LOCATION>South
Carolina</LOCATION> on <DATE>Sept. 21</DATE>.
   ``I've seen greater damage in smaller areas,'' said <PERSON>Bob Sheets</PERSON>,
director of the hurricane center. ``But I've never seen it on such
a large scale where you go mile after mile with such massive
damage.''
   Overall damage from Hugo totaled about <MONEY>$10 billion</MONEY>. In the
<LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, it caused a record storm damage of about <MONEY>$7 billion</MONEY>.
Most of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> damage was around <LOCATION>Charleston</LOCATION>.
   The <LOCATION>U.S. Virgin Islands</LOCATION> are racing to recover from Hugo in time
for the tourist season.
   ``We are still in a sense reeling from the effects of Hugo but
that didn't dampen our spirit,'' said <PERSON>Alexander A. Ferrelly</PERSON>,
governor of the <LOCATION>U.S. Virgin Islands</LOCATION>. He said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> that <LOCATION>St.
Thomas</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>St. John</LOCATION> are ready for winter tourists and <ORGANIZATION>St. Croix</ORGANIZATION>
would be ready by early <DATE>1990</DATE>.
   It was the most expensive disaster for the <ORGANIZATION>American Red Cross</ORGANIZATION>
since the organization began 110 years ago. Latest figures show the
agency has spent about <MONEY>$38 million</MONEY> in the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> and the
<LOCATION>Carolinas</LOCATION>, said <PERSON>Michael Caudill</PERSON>, a spokesman in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>.
   The hurricane season, which began <DATE>June 1</DATE>, had four tropical
storms, counting <PERSON>Karen</PERSON>, and seven hurricanes. The storms also were
stronger than usual, said Sheets.
   Last year, there were seven tropical storms and five hurricanes.
The <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> season usually has 10 named storms. Normally, only
five or six whip up the 74-mph sustained winds to become a
hurricane.
   Hugo, the fifth major <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> hurricane in the last decade to
reach <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> shores, may have marked the end of a 30-year period of
fewer, weaker hurricanes, Sheets said.
   ``There have been fewer of the stronger hurricanes making
landfall since the <DATE>1960s</DATE>,'' Sheets said. ``Now maybe we're starting
to return to more normal activity like we had in the <DATE>'50s</DATE> and
<DATE>'60s</DATE>.''
   During the <DATE>1950s</DATE>, eight major hurricanes hit the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>,
while seven struck the following decade.
   After Hugo, the most damaging tropical system this year was
<ORGANIZATION>Tropical Storm Allison</ORGANIZATION>. It dumped large amounts of rain and caused
11 deaths and <MONEY>$500 million</MONEY> damage in <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION>.

   Hurricane Gustav curved away from outer <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION>
islands <DATE>Monday</DATE> and aimed its 105 mph winds toward open ocean.
   Gustav _ which reached hurricane strength <DATE>Sunday</DATE> while heading
west toward the <LOCATION>Leeward Islands</LOCATION> _ turned north onto a path that
would skirt the island chain and take it out into the <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION>.
Storm warnings in the islands, which stretch north from the
Venezuelan coast, were droppped, but forecasters said rough seas
and surf might be experienced.
   ``They'll probably get a little of the fringe effects,'' said
<PERSON>Bob Sheets</PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION>National Hurricane Center</ORGANIZATION> in suburban
<LOCATION>Coral Gables</LOCATION>. ``But the hurricane itself looks like it's going to
pass to the east.''
   At <TIME>3 p.m. EDT</TIME>, <PERSON>Gustav</PERSON> was centered near 17.4 degrees north
latitude and 58.2 degrees west longitude, or about 240 miles east
of <LOCATION>Antigua</LOCATION>. It was moving north at 10 mph and was expected to hold
that course and speed for the next day or two.
   Gustav had hurricane-force winds extending 35 miles from its
center and tropical storm-force winds extending outward 175 miles.
   Over the <DATE>weekend</DATE>, islanders with strong memories of last year's
Hurricane Hugo had scrambled to prepare for <ORGANIZATION>Gustav</ORGANIZATION>'s expected
onslaught.
   In <LOCATION>Montserrat</LOCATION>, a British colony devastated by Hugo, banks,
hardware stores, pharmacies and supermarkets opened <DATE>Sunday</DATE>.
   Utilities called workers back from vacation, and the 100-member
police and 50-strong volunteer army were fully mobilized.
   ``The level of preparedness and the level of activity is
significantly greater than it was last year'' before Hugo, said
<PERSON>Reuben Meade</PERSON>, the government's director of development. ``They are
out there in earnest.''
   Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION>Tropical Storm Hortense</ORGANIZATION> remained about a thousand
miles to the east in the <LOCATION>mid-Atlantic</LOCATION>, a hindrance only to shipping.
   At noon <ORGANIZATION>EDT</ORGANIZATION> <DATE>Monday</DATE>, <PERSON>Hortense</PERSON> had winds of 45 mph. It was moving
north-northwest at about 8 mph.
   The storm was centered near 19.1 degrees north latitude, 41.8
degrees west longitude, or about 1000 miles west of the <LOCATION>Cape Verde
Islands of Africa</LOCATION>. It wasn't expected to gain strength, but
forecasters planned to keep an eye on it.
   Tropical depressions become tropical storms when their sustained
winds reach 39 mph. Tropical storms become hurricanes at 74 mph.

   Tropical Storm Hugo today edged closer to becoming a
hurricane as it began following the path of its predecessor,
<PERSON>Gabrielle</PERSON>.
   The eighth named storm of this year's <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> hurricane season
had sustained winds of 65 mph. At <TIME>6 a.m. EDT</TIME> it was centered near
latitude 12.7 north and longitude 42.0 west, 1,300 miles east of the
Lesser Antilles.
   The storm was headed west at about 20 mph and was expected to
hold its course through today, possibly affecting the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> in
four or five days. Forecasters said Hugo could become a hurricane,
with 74 mph winds, within a day or so.
   ``It's not as big a system (as <PERSON>Gabrielle</PERSON>) and it seems to be
getting better organized,'' said forecaster <PERSON>Gil Clark</PERSON> of the
<ORGANIZATION>National Hurricane Center</ORGANIZATION> in suburban <LOCATION>Coral Gables</LOCATION>.
   Tropical Storm <PERSON>Gabrielle</PERSON> continued dissolving in the cold water
of the northern <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION>, about 280 miles south of <LOCATION>Cape Race</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Newfoundland</LOCATION>.
   The former hurricane's winds today were down to 40 mph, 1 mph
over the minimum for tropical-storm classification, but still
causing 6- to 10-foot swells along <LOCATION>Nova Scotia</LOCATION>. Swells as high as 16
feet from <LOCATION>Gabrielle</LOCATION> were blamed for the disappearances of at least
seven people from <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION> in the past week.

<TEXT>
   Hurricane Hugo struck <LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION> with
renewed fury <DATE>Thursday</DATE> after thousands of coastal residents in
southeastern states grabbed what they could carry and fled inland on
jammed highways.
   ``This is a disaster staring us right in the eye,'' Mayor <PERSON>Joseph
P. Riley Jr.</PERSON> said from his <ORGANIZATION>City Hall</ORGANIZATION> command post in <LOCATION>Charleston</LOCATION>,
where the hurricane downed power lines, snapped trees and caused
utility transformers to explode.
   ``All we can do now is pray and hope all the precautions we have
taken have been sufficient,'' <PERSON>Riley</PERSON> said as Hugo's eye bore in on
the city. ``I just hope and pray we can get through this without any
loss of life.''
   By <TIME>midnight</TIME>, 119 mph winds were reported in <LOCATION>Charleston</LOCATION>. The roof
cracked at <ORGANIZATION>City Hall</ORGANIZATION>, a 188-year-old brick building that has
withstood several hurricanes, and torrents of water poured into the
paneled council chamber. Phone and electric service to the command
post was knocked out.
   Hurricane-force winds first hit the coast by <TIME>9:15 p.m. EDT</TIME>, and
about three hours later the eye of the storm passed over the Isle of
Palms just east of <LOCATION>Charleston</LOCATION>, said <PERSON>Bob Sheets</PERSON>, director of the
<ORGANIZATION>National Hurricane Center</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Coral Gables</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla</LOCATION>.
   The eye was about 10 miles across and top winds were still at 135
mph.
   Hugo was expected to turn gradually to the north, causing severe
flooding as it moved up the <LOCATION>East Coast</LOCATION>. The storm posed a <PERCENT>19 percent</PERCENT>
chance of hitting <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION> and a <PERCENT>16 percent</PERCENT> chance of hitting
<LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> before <DATE>Sunday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>, the hurricane center said.
   As Hugo neared the coast, roads from <ORGANIZATION>Hilton Head</ORGANIZATION> to <LOCATION>Myrtle Beach</LOCATION>,
200 miles north, were nearly empty, as were the boarded-up resort
towns themselves. Power lines and trees were downed in some spots
and water flooded roads. Stop lights and neon lights were knocked
out in <LOCATION>Myrtle Beach</LOCATION>.
   ``One eyewitness said `It's like a light show,''' said <PERSON>Amy
Garrison</PERSON>, a reporter at WKZQ AM-FM in <LOCATION>Myrtle Beach</LOCATION>.
   In <LOCATION>Charleston</LOCATION>, the hurricane littered streets with tin roofs,
palmetto fronds and chunks of bark. Businesses were closed and
classes at public schools and universities canceled. Riley ordered
residents of one-story homes to evacuate.
   Hospitals stockpiled supplies, discharging any patients well
enough to go and moving others to hospitals inland to make room for
emergency patients, officials said.
   About 12,000 people had checked into 83 shelters across the state
as of <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>evening</TIME>, and more were expected, said <PERSON>Bennish Brown</PERSON>,
a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION>Emergency Operations Center</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Columbia</LOCATION>, 220
miles northwest of here.
   ``We tried to close the doors but people are sneaking in side
doors,'' said <PERSON>Elaine Skelton</PERSON>, a registered nurse working at the
<ORGANIZATION>Conway High School</ORGANIZATION> shelter near <LOCATION>Myrtle Beach</LOCATION>. ``We tried to post
guards at the doors, but people were still coming in.''
   <ORGANIZATION>American Red Cross</ORGANIZATION> relief efforts were buckling under the number
of evacuees, said <PERSON>Brian Ruberry</PERSON>, a spokesman in <LOCATION>Savannah</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ga.</LOCATION>, who
appealed for help.
   ``Right now the <ORGANIZATION>Red Cross</ORGANIZATION> is sheltering tens of thousands of
people all along the <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> seaboard. This of course is at the same
time that we're sheltering 25,000 people on <LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION> and the
other <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> islands.
   ``We're beginning to feel the squeeze. Our resources are very
tight. Right now Hugo is shaping up to be one of our biggest relief
operations of the decade.''
   At <TIME>midnight</TIME>, the center of Hugo was near latitude 32.7 degrees
north and longitude 79.9 degrees west, forecasters said. The
hurricane's speed had picked up to 22 mph from 20 mph earlier.
   Near its center, Hugo's muscle reached winds of 135 mph, up from
125 mph earlier in the day and 105 mph the day before. North and
<LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION> can expect tornadoes linked to Hugo for the next two
days, according to the hurricane center.
   The coastal area could expect hurricane force winds for 10 to 12
hours once the eye comes ashore, officials said. A hurricane warning
was in effect between <LOCATION>Fernandina Beach</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla.</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Oregon Inlet</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.C.</LOCATION>
   By <TIME>late afternoon</TIME>, <PERSON>Hugo</PERSON> was upgraded to a category 4 hurricane on
the Saffir-Simpson scale of strength, the second mightiest category,
which indicated it could cause extreme damage.
   ``It strengthened more than we thought it would,'' Sheets said,
adding that Hugo would cause severe flooding as it moved up the
<LOCATION>Appalachians</LOCATION>.
   The timing of the landfall was critical because of the storm's
tidal surge, a dome of water 10 to 15 feet high that would feed a
normal 5-foot high tide that peaks after <TIME>2 a.m.</TIME>
   ``On top of that will be waves,'' Sheets said earlier, and in
many places on barrier islands ``the buildings will be swept clean
off.''

<DATELINE>SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The region's mightiest hurricane in
a decade lashed <LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION> today after battering the <LOCATION>U.S. Virgin
Islands</LOCATION> and other tourist havens, leaving at least nine people dead
and thousands homeless.
   The <ORGANIZATION>National Weather Service</ORGANIZATION> said Hurricane Hugo hit the eastern
tip of <LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION> and skirted the northern coast, packing 125 mph
winds and a 6-foot tidal surges. Forecasters expected up to 15
inches of rain and flooding and mudslides all over the island.
   ``We're getting ravaged,'' said ham radio operator <PERSON>Fernando
Garcia</PERSON> in <LOCATION>San Juan</LOCATION>. ``Part of my aluminum siding is gone, my next
door neighbor's aluminum siding is gone ....''
   There were reports of heavy damage, some looting, no water and no
electricity in <LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION>.
   At noon <ORGANIZATION>EDT</ORGANIZATION>, Hugo's center was near latitude 18.6 degrees north
and longitude 66.0 west about 20 miles north of <LOCATION>San Juan</LOCATION>, said the
<ORGANIZATION>National Hurricane Center</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Coral Gables</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla</LOCATION>.
   On <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, Hugo plowed west-northwest through the eastern
<LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION>, slamming into the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>British Virgin Islands</LOCATION> with
100 mph winds and rains that caused heavy flooding and destroyed
homes.
   Five people were reported killed, 80 injured and more than 10,000
homeless on the French island of <LOCATION>Guadeloupe</LOCATION>, relief officials said.
Corrugated steel roofs were torn off, power lines ripped free and
crops were destroyed. The airport's control tower was knocked out of
commission, permitting only visual landings by relief planes.
   Two people were killed in <LOCATION>Antigua</LOCATION> and one in <LOCATION>Montserrat</LOCATION>,
according to <ORGANIZATION>Beacon Radio</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Anguilla</LOCATION>. Ham radio operators reported
at least five deaths in <LOCATION>Montserrat</LOCATION>, but there was no official
confirmation.
   Nearly all of <LOCATION>Montserrat</LOCATION>'s 12,000 residents were homeless and
schools, hospitals and the police department all suffered serious
damage, said ham radio operator <PERSON>Stuart Haimes</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Queens</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>
   Police said a man was electrocuted in <LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION> when he touched
a power line while removing a TV antenna from his roof in preparing
for the storm.
   Off <LOCATION>St. Thomas</LOCATION>, charter boat captain <PERSON>O.B. O'Brian</PERSON> told CNN by
ship-to-shore telephone <TIME>this morning</TIME>:
   ``Looking down the lagoon, we see a lot of sailboats intertwined
and a lot of sails ripped and a lot of sails down. It looks pretty
bad ... There was a lot of wind.''
   Most of the <LOCATION>Virgin Islands</LOCATION>' 106,000 residents live on <LOCATION>St. Thomas</LOCATION>.
On <ORGANIZATION>St. Croix</ORGANIZATION>, a ham radio operator said the winds tore off the roofs
from up to <PERCENT>75 percent</PERCENT> of the homes.
   Officials said stores in the <LOCATION>St. Croix</LOCATION> town of <LOCATION>Christiansted</LOCATION> were
heavily damaged, and there were reports of looting. National Guard
Adjutant Gen. <PERSON>Robert Moorehead</PERSON> said 1,000 people were evacuated to
rescue shelters in <LOCATION>St. Croix</LOCATION>.
   Storm watches were in effect for parts of the <LOCATION>Dominican Republic</LOCATION>,
and a hurricane warning was issued for the southern <LOCATION>Bahamas</LOCATION>,
including the Turks and Caicos islands.
   Hugo was moving at 10 mph west-northwest alongside <LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION>, a
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> commonwealth with 3.3 million people. Hurricane-force winds
extended up to 75 miles from its center. The weather service said
winds ripped the roof off a baseball stadium on the offshore island
of <LOCATION>Vieques</LOCATION>, about 10 miles to the east with about 7,000 residents.
   High winds <DATE>Sunday</DATE> blew roofs off six houses in the offshore
island of <LOCATION>Culebra</LOCATION>. Luis <ORGANIZATION>Munoz Marin International Airport</ORGANIZATION>, by far
the region's biggest, was closed, as were schools, banks, courts and
government offices.
   The <ORGANIZATION>National Guard</ORGANIZATION> had been mobilized in both the <LOCATION>Virgin Islands</LOCATION>
and <LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION>.
   Meteorologist <PERSON>Jesse Moore</PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION>National Hurricane Center</ORGANIZATION> said
it was too early to tell whether Hugo would strike the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
mainland. He said the storm was expected to be off the southeastern
Bahamas by <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> and ``after that, it's anybody's guess.''
   Residents of hilly areas where flash floods are a danger were
urged to evacuate, and <ORGANIZATION>Social Services</ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON>Carmen Sonia Zayas</PERSON>
said 11,300 people were moved from flood-prone coastal areas to
rescue shelters.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Port Authority</ORGANIZATION> also said cruise ships scheduled to arrive in
<LOCATION>San Juan</LOCATION>, where one-third of the island population lives, had been
routed elswhere.
   Hugo uprooted trees and knocked out power in the <LOCATION>British Virgin
Islands</LOCATION>. On the resort island of <LOCATION>Tortola</LOCATION> in the <LOCATION>British Virgin
Islands</LOCATION>, residents said there were numerous injuries and scores of
homes destroyed.
   ``We are aware of the widespread damage. We may have to declare
the area a disaster area,'' said <PERSON>Louis Walters</PERSON>, education minister
in the <LOCATION>British Virgin Islands</LOCATION>.
   The <LOCATION>Virgin Islands</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION> were last hit by a major
hurricane in <DATE>1956</DATE>, when <PERSON>Betsy</PERSON> caused extensive damage and killed 11
people in <LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION>.
   Officials in <LOCATION>Guadeloupe</LOCATION> said many buildings were damaged.
   The mayor of <ORGANIZATION>St. Francois</ORGANIZATION>, a village on the island's eastern end,
told <ORGANIZATION>Radio Caraibe Internationale</ORGANIZATION> that there was nothing left of it.
   ``Aside from a few houses, almost all the rest were destroyed,''
said Mayor <PERSON>Ernest Moutoussamy</PERSON>. He said several hotels suffered
serious damage.
   In <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>, a plane was sent <DATE>Sunday</DATE> with 60 rescue workers and
emergency supplies for <LOCATION>Guadeloupe</LOCATION>, and two more were standing by
waiting for <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> airports to reopen.
   Hugo is the fourth hurricane of the <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> hurricane season,
which runs from <DATE>June 1</DATE> to <DATE>Nov. 30</DATE>.
   It is the most powerful hurricane to hit the region since
Hurricane David in <DATE>1979</DATE>. That storm killed an estimated 1,200 people
in the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>.

   Tropical Storm Hugo would soon strengthen into a
hurricane as it churned across the <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> toward the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION>,
forecasters said <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, and <PERSON>Gabrielle</PERSON> whipped up heavy swells as
it moved away from <LOCATION>Nova Scotia</LOCATION>.
   Hugo, the eighth named storm of this <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> hurricane season,
had winds of 65 mph with stronger gusts in squalls, and forecasters
said conditions were right for it to grow stronger.
   ``It still looks impressive on the satellite imagery, meaning it
has continued to strengthen some,'' forecaster <PERSON>Max Mayfield</PERSON> of the
<ORGANIZATION>National Hurricane Center</ORGANIZATION> in suburban <LOCATION>Coral Gables</LOCATION> said, adding that
Hugo could be up to 74 mph hurricane-strength winds in a day or two.
   At <TIME>10:30 p.m. EDT</TIME>, Hugo's center was near latitude 12.9 north and
longitude 39.0 west, or about 930 miles west-southwest of the
westernmost <LOCATION>Cape Verde</LOCATION> islands. It was headed west at about 20 mph
and was on a path that could take it to the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> in about five
days, forecasters said.
   Tropical Storm <PERSON>Gabrielle</PERSON>'s winds were down to 40 mph, but still
causing swells as high as 16 feet along the south coast of <LOCATION>Nova
Scotia</LOCATION> and parts of <LOCATION>New England</LOCATION>, forecasters said.
   Gabrielle was expected to weaken as it accelerated to the
northeast over northern <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> waters.
   At <TIME>10:30 p.m. EDT</TIME>, <PERSON>Gabrielle</PERSON>'s center was near latitude 41.7
north, longitude 55.0 west, or about 345 miles south southwest of
<LOCATION>Cape Race</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Newfoundland</LOCATION>. It was drifting east-northeast at about 10
mph.

<TEXT>
   The <DATE>1990</DATE> Atlantic hurricane season had more storms
than usual and some forecasters predict that's just a hint of more
frequent and more forceful hurricanes in the coming years.
   But this year's batch did not include the devastating storms of
years past and at least one forecaster thinks <DATE>1991</DATE> will be a calmer
year. The season ends today.
   <PERSON>Dr. William Gray</PERSON>, a professor of atmospheric science at <ORGANIZATION>Colorado
State University</ORGANIZATION>, thinks a dry spell in <LOCATION>West Africa</LOCATION> during the past
two decades explained the reduction of storms along the eastern
seaboard in the <DATE>last 20 years</DATE>.
   In <DATE>1988</DATE> and <DATE>1989</DATE>, there was near normal rainfall in the <LOCATION>Sahel</LOCATION>,
the semi-arid land on the southern fringe of the <LOCATION>Sahara Desert</LOCATION>.
Some meteorological experts think the rainfall signaled the end of
a 20-year drought - and may have spawned <PERSON>Gilbert</PERSON> in <DATE>1988</DATE> and Hugo
in <DATE>1989</DATE>.
   Gray on <DATE>Thursday</DATE> predicted a below-average hurricane season in
<DATE>1991</DATE>. He based his forecast on several factors, including an
anticipated below-average rainfall in the Sahel.
   But Gray and other forecasters agree that the general outlook
for the <DATE>1990s</DATE> and the early years of the next century is for more
intense hurricanes than those of the <DATE>last two decades</DATE>.
   ``We've been through a real long period of hurricane inactivity
in the '70s and '80s up until <DATE>1985</DATE>, and I think we're coming out of
that,'' said <PERSON>Bob Sheets</PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION>National Hurricane Center</ORGANIZATION>
in <LOCATION>Coral Gables</LOCATION>.
   ``Perhaps the Gilberts and the Hugos were signaling that,'' he
said, recalling Hurricane Gilbert that wracked the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> and
Hurricane Hugo that devastated <LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION> - two of the most
destructive <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> hurricanes ever.
   Hurricanes have been recorded in the <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> every month except
<DATE>April</DATE>, but are rare outside the hurricane season, <DATE>June 1</DATE> to <DATE>Nov.
30</DATE>.
   In this year's season, there were 14 named storms, eight of them
hurricanes. The average number of storms is nine, with about six
becoming hurricanes. Usually only a couple of those storms strike
the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
   While many of the storms spun harmlessly through the <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION>,
several caused their share of destruction.
   The most deadly storm was Hurricane Diana, which swept into
<LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> in early <DATE>August</DATE>, resulting in flash floods and mudslides
that killed 96 people and caused extensive damage to roads,
property and agriculture, the weather service reported.
   A weather disturbance becomes a tropical storm, and is given a
name, if its sustained winds reach 39 mph. Storms become hurricanes
if winds reach 74 mph.

<TEXT>
   Hugo became a hurricane <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>evening</TIME> as it sped
westward toward the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION>, but forecasters said it was too early
to determine whether it was a threat to land.
   ``The longer it heads west, the more concern it is to us,'' said
<PERSON>Hal Gerrish</PERSON>, a forecaster for the <ORGANIZATION>National Hurricane Center</ORGANIZATION>. ``But
we're not sure yet where it will go _ there are too many things that
can happen.''
   Hugo's most recent predecessors, hurricanes Dean, <PERSON>Erin and
Gabrielle</PERSON>, turned north into the open <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> before reaching the
<LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Gerrish</PERSON> noted. But last year's killer Hurricane Gilbert
remained on the westward course, wreaking havoc on the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>.
   At <TIME>10:30 p.m. EDT</TIME>, Hugo's center was located near 12.9 north
latitude and 46.3 west longitude, or about 965 miles east of the
easternmost Lesser Antilles, and was moving west at 20 mph.
Sustained winds reached 75 mph, just over the hurricane threshold,
and further strengthening was expected.
   Meanwhile, <PERSON>Gabrielle</PERSON> was downgraded to an extratropical storm as
it moved through the <LOCATION>North Atlantic</LOCATION>, and the center stopped issuing
bulletins on it. Its last position was about 225 miles southeast of
<LOCATION>Cape Race</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Newfoundland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>, moving northeast at 20 to 25 mph
with winds of 55 mph.
   Gabrielle and Hugo are the seventh and eighth named storms of the
<DATE>1989</DATE> Atlantic hurricane season. They become storms when sustained
winds reach 39 mph and are classified as hurricanes when the
strength increases to 74 mph.

   Hurricane Hugo ripped away rooftops
and uprooted trees in <LOCATION>Guadeloupe</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Dominica</LOCATION> early <DATE>Sunday</DATE> and
approached other popular resort islands of the eastern <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION>
with deadly winds of up to 140 mph.
   Forecasters described Hugo as ``extremely dangerous'' and said it
could be the most powerful hurricane to hit the region since
Hurricane David in <DATE>1979</DATE>. That storm killed an estimated 1,200 people
in the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>.
   ``The eye of the hurricane is directly above <LOCATION>Guadeloupe</LOCATION>,'' <PERSON>Israel
Matos</PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION>National Weather Service</ORGANIZATION> bureau in <LOCATION>San Juan</LOCATION>,
said <DATE>Sunday</DATE> at <TIME>1:25 a.m. EDT</TIME>. It was impossible to telephone to
<LOCATION>Guadeloupe</LOCATION> early <DATE>Sunday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME> as telephone circuits were either
jammed or busy.
   At <TIME>midnight EDT</TIME> <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, Hugo's center was near 16.3 north
latitude and 61.1 west longitude, about 350 miles east-southeast of
<LOCATION>San Juan</LOCATION>. After hitting the French island it was expected to move
north toward <LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION>, said forecaster <PERSON>Martin Nelson</PERSON> at the
<ORGANIZATION>National Hurricane Center</ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>.
   The hurricane was moving west-northwest at 12 mph, sending
showers and gusty winds to the eastern edge of the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> and
threatening islands over a 600-mile arc stretching from <LOCATION>St. Lucia</LOCATION> to
<LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION>.
   The storm's effects would start to be felt in the <LOCATION>Virgin Islands</LOCATION>
and <LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION> by <DATE>Sunday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME>, the <ORGANIZATION>National Weather Service</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>San Juan</LOCATION> said.
   By midnight there was a blackout in most of <LOCATION>Guadeloupe</LOCATION> as
authorities turned off electricity as a precautionary measure,
government radio <ORGANIZATION>RFO</ORGANIZATION> said. The island experienced very strong winds,
which blew the metal roofing off some homes on <LOCATION>Guadeloupe</LOCATION>'s eastern
side late <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>.
   In <LOCATION>Dominica</LOCATION> to the south there were power outages on the island's
north side where strong winds uprooted trees, the radio said.
   <ORGANIZATION>Radio France Internationale</ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>, monitored in <LOCATION>San Juan</LOCATION>
shortly before <TIME>midnight</TIME> <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, said French authorities were
preparing to send emergency supplies and personnel to <LOCATION>Guadeloupe</LOCATION>.
   ``It's a very dangerous storm, extremely dangerous in fact,''
<PERSON>Nelson</PERSON> said.
   Forecasters said if the storm remains on its northwesterly course
it would pass over <LOCATION>St. Croix</LOCATION> in the <LOCATION>U.S. Virgin Islands</LOCATION> about <TIME>6 p.m.</TIME>
<DATE>Sunday</DATE> and continue on to the northeastern coast of <LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION>
early <DATE>Monday</DATE>. San Juan, the <LOCATION>Puerto Rican</LOCATION> capital with a population
of 1.1 million, is on the northeastern coast.
   Earlier, forecasters had said the hurricane was headed for <LOCATION>Puerto
Rico</LOCATION>'s southern coast.
   The <ORGANIZATION>National Weather Service</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> issued hurricane warnings
at <TIME>3 p.m. EDT</TIME> for the <LOCATION>U.S. Virgin Islands</LOCATION> and for <LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION>, which
previously had been on a hurricane watch. The warnings were posted
from <LOCATION>Martinique</LOCATION> northward and westward through <LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION>,
including the British Virgin Islands and <ORGANIZATION>St. Martin</ORGANIZATION> and surrounding
islands.
   Tropical storm watches for the islands of <LOCATION>Barbados</LOCATION> and <PERSON>St.
Vincent</PERSON> were discontinued, and a warning for <LOCATION>St. Lucia</LOCATION> was changed
to a tropical storm watch.
   Forecasters said waves 10 feet above normal could be expected
near the eye of Hugo, and warned of heavy rain and flooding.
   In <LOCATION>Guadeloupe</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Dominica</LOCATION>, the first two islands directly in
Hugo's path, civil defense officials prepared to evacuate people to
rescue shelters.
   <PERSON>Franklin McDonald</PERSON>, head of the Pan-Caribbean Disaster
Preparedness and <ORGANIZATION>Prevention Project</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Antigua</LOCATION>, said several relief
teams from the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> already were headed to the region.
   State radio said a heavy downpour set off a landslide early
<DATE>Saturday</DATE> on <LOCATION>Dominica</LOCATION>'s isolated southeast side, which faces the
<LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION>, partly blocking a road but causing no injuries. The <ORGANIZATION>Public
Works Department</ORGANIZATION> deployed earth-moving equipment at strategic points
across the island.
   Non-critically ill patients at <ORGANIZATION>Princess Margaret Hospital</ORGANIZATION> in the
capital of <LOCATION>Roseau</LOCATION> were sent home late <DATE>Friday</DATE> and early <DATE>Saturday</DATE> to
make room for possible hurricane victims.
   The government of <LOCATION>Dominica</LOCATION> urged its citizens via radio to take
emergency precautions, and said police were put on alert ``to deal
with any security problem which might arise.'' There was widespread
looting after Hurricane David battered the tiny island of 81,000
people.
   In <LOCATION>Guadeloupe</LOCATION>, which has a population of 340,000, heavy traffic
built up in Pointe-a-Pitre, the biggest city, late <DATE>Friday</DATE> as people
rushed supermarkets and hardware stores, stocking up on food,
bottled water and supplies such as flashlights, batteries, timber,
nails and tape.
   The government ordered all pedestrians and cars to be off the
streets by <TIME>6 p.m.</TIME> in what amounted to a curfew. The directions were
broadcast on radio stations.
   Residents boarded up doors and windows of their homes and many on
the <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> side fled inland.
   At Le <ORGANIZATION>Meridien</ORGANIZATION>, a luxury, 271-room beachfront hotel in <LOCATION>St.
Francois</LOCATION>, a woman who answered the telephone said guests were being
moved from ground-floor rooms and those facing the ocean. But she
said none of the 100 guests had checked out.
   ``Many people are worried; nobody's hysterical,'' said the hotel
employee, who asked not to be identified by name.
   In <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Air France</ORGANIZATION> canceled all three of its flights scheduled
<DATE>Saturday</DATE> to <LOCATION>Guadeloupe</LOCATION>'s sister island, <LOCATION>Martinique</LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION>British
Airways</ORGANIZATION> canceled its flight from <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Antigua</LOCATION>, where the
airport was closed.
   Officials in <LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION> said up to 6,000 people might have to be
evacuated from flood-prone areas if Hugo passes near the densely
populated island of 3.3 million.
   Hugo is the eighth named storm of the current <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> hurricane
season, which runs from <DATE>June 1</DATE> to <DATE>Nov. 30</DATE>.

   Hurricane Hugo's 125 mph winds
pounded <LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION> on <DATE>Monday</DATE> after ripping across other islands in
the eastern <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION>, leaving at least 14 people dead and thousands
homeless.
   The <ORGANIZATION>National Weather Service</ORGANIZATION> said Hugo, the most powerful storm
to hit the region this decade, slammed into the eastern tip of
<LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION> and skirted the northern coast before roaring to the
west-northwest toward the <LOCATION>Bahamas</LOCATION>.
   Hugo also threatens the <LOCATION>Dominican Republic</LOCATION>, which shares the
island of Hispaniola with <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>, and civil defense authorities in
the <LOCATION>Dominican Republic</LOCATION> before dark <DATE>Monday</DATE> declared a state of
emergency.
   <ORGANIZATION>Eastern Airlines</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON>Karen Ceremsak</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> said the
carrier flew a special <ORGANIZATION>Boeing</ORGANIZATION> 727 charter to the Dominican resort of
<LOCATION>Puerto Plata</LOCATION> <DATE>Monday</DATE> and returned to <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> with about 135 vacationers.
   The storm's winds overturned cars and stripped roofs off houses
and office buildings and sent chunks of concrete plunging into
streets in <LOCATION>San Juan</LOCATION>, where one-third of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> commonwealth's 3.3
million people live. Fifty airplanes were reported destroyed at the
airport in <LOCATION>Isla Verde</LOCATION>.
   There was widespread damage in <LOCATION>San Juan</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Condado Beach</LOCATION> area, the
site of many of the island's large tourist hotels. Shattered glass,
strips of roofing and overturned trees littered the streets, and few
drivers ventured out in their vehicles.
   Hugo cut power and disrupted international communications to the
island.
   One woman in a <LOCATION>San Juan</LOCATION> high-rise told radio station WOSO of
watching sections of the city darken as the first high winds and
heavy rains hit <LOCATION>San Juan</LOCATION>. Widespread power outages also were
reported in the <LOCATION>Dominican Republic</LOCATION>.
   There were no immediate reports of casualties in <LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION>
although one man was electrocuted while trying to remove a
television antenna as he prepared for the storm <DATE>Sunday</DATE>.
   Bands of people, mostly youths, looted storm-damaged shops in <LOCATION>San
Juan</LOCATION> and police patrols were reinforced at the main <ORGANIZATION>Post Office</ORGANIZATION>,
political party offices and shopping areas.
   In a boutique on the ground floor of the two-story building
housing <ORGANIZATION>The Associated Press</ORGANIZATION> bureau in <LOCATION>San Juan</LOCATION>, young looters
defied winds hitting 100mph at the peak of the storm and carried out
armloads of women's clothing.
   The storm blew out the windows in the AP office on a peninsula
between the sea and <LOCATION>San Juan</LOCATION> harbor, destroying its computers and
office equipment. One staffer said his furniture was blown out the
windows of his apartment on the 20th story of his building.
   At <TIME>6 p.m. EDT</TIME>, Hugo's center was latitude 19.5 degrees north and
longitude 67.0 west, or 90 miles northwest of <LOCATION>San Juan</LOCATION>, said the
<ORGANIZATION>National Hurricane Center</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Coral Gables</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla</LOCATION>. It said Hugo was
moving 13 mph in a wobbly, west-northwest to northwest direction.
   Maximum sustained winds declined slightly over the day, to 115
mph, and hurricane-force winds extended up to 75 miles from its
center, the forecasters added.
   Meteorologist <PERSON>Jesse Moore</PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION>National Hurricane Center</ORGANIZATION> said
it was too early to tell whether Hugo would strike the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
mainland. He said the storm was expected to be off southeastern
Bahamas by <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> and ``after that, it's anybody's guess.''
   Five people were reported killed, 80 injured and more than 10,000
homeless <DATE>Sunday</DATE> on the French island of <LOCATION>Guadeloupe</LOCATION>, relief officials
said. Two people were killed in <LOCATION>Antigua</LOCATION>, according to <ORGANIZATION>Beacon Radio</ORGANIZATION>
in <LOCATION>Anguilla</LOCATION>, and there were reports of six deaths in <LOCATION>Montserrat</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Richard Weening</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Milwaukee</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wis.</LOCATION>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Caribbean
Communications Co.</ORGANIZATION>, which operates the <ORGANIZATION>GEM Radio Network</ORGANIZATION> from its
headquarters on <LOCATION>Montserrat</LOCATION>, said ham operators linked to the network
said the storm killed six people on the <LOCATION>British Island</LOCATION> and damaged
<PERCENT>95 percent</PERCENT> of the homes and the hospital.
   Nearly all of <LOCATION>Montserrat</LOCATION>'s 12,000 residents were homeless and
without food or fresh water, said ham radio operator <PERSON>Stuart Haimes</PERSON>
of <LOCATION>Queens</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>
   Off <LOCATION>St. Thomas</LOCATION>, charter boat captain <PERSON>O.B. O'Brian</PERSON> told <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> TV
station WTVJ that many boats and homes had been damaged. ``I'd say
the island is pretty well devastated,'' he said.
   Most of the <LOCATION>Virgin Islands</LOCATION>' 106,000 residents live on <LOCATION>St. Thomas</LOCATION>
and <LOCATION>St. Croix</LOCATION>. On <ORGANIZATION>St. Croix</ORGANIZATION>, a ham radio operator said the winds
tore off the roofs from up to <PERCENT>75 percent</PERCENT> of the homes.
   Officials said stores in the <LOCATION>St. Croix</LOCATION> town of <LOCATION>Christiansted</LOCATION> were
heavily damaged, and there were reports of looting. National Guard
Adjutant Gen. <PERSON>Robert Moorehead</PERSON> said 1,000 people were evacuated to
rescue shelters in <LOCATION>St. Croix</LOCATION>.
   Storm watches were in effect for parts of the <LOCATION>Dominican Republic</LOCATION>,
and a hurricane warning was issued for the southern <LOCATION>Bahamas</LOCATION>,
including the Turks and Caicos islands.
   The weather service said winds ripped the roof off a baseball
stadium on <LOCATION>Vieques</LOCATION>, an island with 7,000 residents 10 miles east of
<LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Bernard Sternberg</PERSON>, a Sunrise, <LOCATION>Fla.</LOCATION>, ham radio operator, said he
talked to a radio operator who was on a boat in the eye of the
hurricane as it passed over <LOCATION>Vieques</LOCATION>. ``He asked us to pray for him
and we did,'' <PERSON>Sternberg</PERSON> said. ``We prayed for all of them.''
   High winds <DATE>Sunday</DATE> blew roofs off six houses in the offshore
island of <LOCATION>Culebra</LOCATION>. San Juan's <ORGANIZATION>Luis Munoz Marin International

   The season's 10th tropical storm formed today after
a depression strengthened rapidly off the Mexican coast,
forecasters said.
   Tropical Storm <PERSON>Jerry</PERSON> had maximum sustained winds of 65 mph and
was moving north through the <LOCATION>Gulf of Mexico</LOCATION> at about 8 mph,
according to the <ORGANIZATION>National Hurricane Center</ORGANIZATION> in suburban <LOCATION>Coral Gables</LOCATION>.
   Forecasters predicted some further increase in <LOCATION>Jerry</LOCATION>'s strength
today. They said there was about a <PERCENT>10 percent</PERCENT> chance of the storm's
center passing within 65 miles of various <ORGANIZATION>Gulf Coast</ORGANIZATION> points from
<LOCATION>Brownsville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, to <LOCATION>Gulfport</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Miss.</LOCATION> by <TIME>7 a.m.</TIME> <DATE>Monday</DATE>.
   At noon <ORGANIZATION>EDT</ORGANIZATION>, the storm's center was located at 22.3 north

   Jerry is the first tropical weather system since Hurricane Hugo
ravaged the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION> coast <DATE>last month</DATE>.
   Tropical depressions become named tropical storms when maximum

<TEXT>
   Hurricanes beginning with G's and H's tend
to make people along the coast a little nervous. There was Hazel in
<DATE>1954</DATE>, <LOCATION>Gracie</LOCATION> in <DATE>1959</DATE>, <PERSON>Gilbert</PERSON> _ which raked the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> in <DATE>1988</DATE>.
And then there was Hugo.
   It's no wonder people are keeping an eye on <PERSON>Gustav</PERSON> and <PERSON>Hortense</PERSON>,
and an ear to the phone at national hurricane central in <LOCATION>Coral
Gables</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla</LOCATION>.
   ``People are saying, `It better not come hit us; we just got our
house put back together,' '' said <PERSON>Darryl Graham</PERSON>, an employee at
<ORGANIZATION>Isle of Palms Hardware</ORGANIZATION>.
   Many residents on the Isle of Palms are still living in houses
with plastic covering the holes left by <DATE>last September</DATE>'s Hurricane
Hugo, which killed 29 people in <LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION> and caused an
estimated <MONEY>$5.9 billion</MONEY> in damage.
   ``Folks around (here) are planning to load everything up and
head out early if it even looks close, but we aren't selling
batteries and water yet,'' he said.
   Despite word from the <ORGANIZATION>National Weather Service</ORGANIZATION> that Hurricane
Gustav and <ORGANIZATION>Tropical Storm Hortense</ORGANIZATION> will skip the <LOCATION>East Coast</LOCATION>,
coastal residents are wary.
   Gustav, with winds of 105 mph, began turning north <DATE>Sunday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>,
and <PERSON>Hortense</PERSON> is continuing a northward path that should keep both
well out in the <LOCATION>Atlantic Ocean</LOCATION>, said <PERSON>Silvia Graff</PERSON>, a meteorologist
with the <ORGANIZATION>National Weather Service</ORGANIZATION>'s hurricane center in <LOCATION>Coral
Gables</LOCATION>.
   ``Fortunately, it looks like the steering currents will keep
both <PERSON>Gustav</PERSON> and <PERSON>Hortense</PERSON> away from the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION>
islands,'' <PERSON>Ms. Graff</PERSON> said.
   ``At least this time around, it looks like <LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION> is off
the hook.''
   <PERSON>Ms. Graff</PERSON> said weather service phones were ``ringing off the
hook,'' with many of the calls coming from <LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Jackie Ford</PERSON>, a Lady's <LOCATION>Island Marina</LOCATION> dockmaster who is thought by
many in the area to have a sixth sense when it comes to predicting
the landfalls of large storms, said he spent most of <DATE>Monday</DATE>
puzzling over the storms' directions.
   ``I've got just one pin on the chart, and I don't have a good
feeling for it one way or the other,'' <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> said. ``It's a little
too early to tell, but I guarantee you we will be keeping an eye on
both of them.''
   Meteorologists watching <PERSON>Gustav</PERSON> believe it's unlikely the
hurricane will turn toward the <LOCATION>U.S. East Coast</LOCATION> as it makes its way
north.
   At <TIME>6 p.m. EDT</TIME>, <PERSON>Gustav</PERSON>'s center was located near 22 degrees north
latitude and 58 degrees west longitude, or about 425 miles
northeast of <LOCATION>Antigua</LOCATION>. It was moving north at about 13 mph and was
expected to hold that course and speed through <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
   Tropical Storm <PERSON>Hortense</PERSON> remained a danger only to shipping. The
storm was centered near 23.2 degrees north latitude and 45.5
degrees west longitude, or about 1,420 miles west-northwest of the
<LOCATION>Cape Verde</LOCATION> islands. Little change in its strength was expected
either.
   Tropical depressions become tropical storms when their sustained
top winds reach 39 mph. Tropical storms become hurricanes at 74 mph.

<TEXT>
   Islanders boarded up their homes and
bought supplies <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> as Hurricane Hugo, blamed in at least 25
deaths, swept along the <LOCATION>Bahamas</LOCATION> after leaving an estimated 50,000
people homeless in the eastern <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION>.
   Weather officials said the hurricane would begin affecting the
British colony of Turks and <LOCATION>Caicos Islands</LOCATION> southeast of the <LOCATION>Bahamas</LOCATION>
chain on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>. The storm was moving on a parallel course
east of the <LOCATION>Bahamas</LOCATION>.
   ``All of the islands at some time or another are going to get
some effects (from Hugo),'' said <PERSON>Noel Risnychok</PERSON>, specialist with the
<ORGANIZATION>National Hurricane Center</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Coral Gables</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla</LOCATION>.
   Weather officials in the <LOCATION>Bahamas</LOCATION> feared Hugo could drift westward
toward more populated islands, including <LOCATION>New Providence</LOCATION>.
   That island, which includes the <LOCATION>Bahamas</LOCATION> capital city of <LOCATION>Nassau</LOCATION>,
is the most populated with an estimated 135,000 people.
   The government of the <LOCATION>Bahamas</LOCATION> <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> downgraded the hurricane
watch for the central <LOCATION>Bahamas</LOCATION> to a tropical storm warning. A
tropical storm warning remained in effect for the southern <LOCATION>Bahamas</LOCATION>,
though it was discontinued for the Turks and <LOCATION>Caicos Islands</LOCATION>.
   At <TIME>10:30 p.m. EDT</TIME> <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, the hurricane's center was near
latitude 23.8 degrees north and longitude 69.5 west, about 190 miles
east northeast of <LOCATION>Grand Turk Island</LOCATION> in the southern <LOCATION>Bahamas</LOCATION>,
according to the <ORGANIZATION>National Weather Service</ORGANIZATION>.
   Hugo was moving in a northwesterly direction at about 12 miles
per hour with its highest sustained winds at 105 mph.
   Government officials in <LOCATION>Nassau</LOCATION> were monitoring the hurricane but
had not made any special preparations <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> for Hugo, said <PERSON>Bill
Kalis</PERSON>, press secretary for the government's information office.
   Residents were told to monitor weather advisories but could go
about their daily businesses, he said.
   ``They were telling everybody to get the water, the lamps
handy,'' said <PERSON>Dorothea Seymour of Naussau</PERSON>, who has a stall at The
<ORGANIZATION>Straw Market</ORGANIZATION> on Bay Street. ``We never had a storm here for some
years. We're always hearing about storms, but they never come.
   ``Some people worry, some people don't,'' she said.
   ``Although the indications are that it's going to move east of
the more populated areas, no one is relaxing their vigil because it
can change direction,'' <PERSON>Kalis</PERSON> said.
   <PERSON>Kalis</PERSON> said residents were gathering supplies in preparation.
   ``The stores have reported brisk sales of supplies such as
flashlight batteries and lumber for boarding up windows,'' he said.
   Weather officials in the <LOCATION>Bahamas</LOCATION> said Hugo's threat to the
northwestern <LOCATION>Bahamas</LOCATION> has intensified because of the
west-northwestern drift that the hurricane is expected to take.
   ``This westward drift can spell trouble for the northwestern
Bahamas which includes the bulk of the population,'' said <PERSON>Ken
Lightbourne</PERSON>, chief meteorological officer for the government's
weather agency in <LOCATION>Nassau</LOCATION>.
   Officials with <ORGANIZATION>Paradise Island Airlines</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Fort Lauderdale</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla.</LOCATION>,
said they had not changed flight schedules yet, but were monitoring
the hurricane's path.
   ``We're just keeping a close eye on it like everybody else,''
said <PERSON>Hugh Riesdorph</PERSON>, director of flight operations for the airlines.
   He said the company makes 11 round-trip flights daily from <LOCATION>Fort
Lauderdale</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Paradise Island</LOCATION>, which is linked by a bridge
to <LOCATION>Nassau</LOCATION>.

   Hurricane Hugo, the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> killer blamed for 25
deaths, seethed past the <LOCATION>Bahamas</LOCATION> <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> on an uncertain path that
threatens an area from <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION> by <DATE>Friday</DATE>.
   Disaster teams found death and destruction in <LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION> and a
string of resort islands clobbered by the mightiest storm in a
decade in the northeastern <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION>. More than 50,000 people were
homeless, and military planes ferried radios, drinking water,
generators, chainsaws and other equipment to stricken areas that
pleaded for more help.
   ``Whole buildings just picked up and left,'' said <PERSON>James Grissim</PERSON>,
a resident of <LOCATION>Water Island</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>St. Thomas</LOCATION>. He recalled ``sheet metal
roofing flying through the air, singing as it went, and glass, the
sound of glass breaking all over the place.''
   Forecasters used computers, satellites and charts of old storms
but could not predict Hugo's wobbly path. It lurched to the north
and west because other weather systems seemed to be blocking it from
heading into the open <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION>.
   At <TIME>10:30 p.m. EDT</TIME>, the hurricane's center was near latitude 23.8
degrees north and longitude 69.5 west, about 190 miles northeast of
<LOCATION>Grand Turk Island</LOCATION>, a British island off the southern <LOCATION>Bahamas</LOCATION>,
according to the <ORGANIZATION>National Weather Service</ORGANIZATION>.
   Hugo was moving northwesterly at about 12 miles per hour, but its
winds were down to 105 mph, and forecasters expected some
fluctuations in Hugo's strength overnight.
   Hurricane warnings were downgraded to storm warnings for the
southern <LOCATION>Bahamas</LOCATION> as Hugo skirted past, but the Bahamian government
issued warnings for the central islands of the archipelago.
Islanders boarded up their homes as a precaution.
   ``No one is relaxing their vigil because it can change
direction,'' said <PERSON>Bill Kalis</PERSON>, press secretary for the government's
information office.
   In <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> officials said they would wait until <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>
before deciding to move the space shuttle Atlantis, scheduled for
launch <DATE>Oct. 12</DATE>, from its launch pad and into shelter. They also put
off a decision on whether to remove a <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> communications satellite
from an Atlas-Centaur rocket on another launch pad until more is
known about Hugo's path.
   ``I think Hugo has certainly got people nervous,'' said <PERSON>Kathleen
Hale</PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION>Dade County Office of Emergency Management</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>Fred Krounse</PERSON>, spokesman at <LOCATION>Brevard County</LOCATION>'s emergency management
office in <LOCATION>Rockledge</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla.</LOCATION>, said volunteers were getting 100
telephone calls an hour.
   Cruise ships steamed out of the way, while <ORGANIZATION>American Airlines</ORGANIZATION>'
heavy <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> service, which uses <LOCATION>San Juan</LOCATION> as its hub, was
suspended.
   In <LOCATION>San Juan</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>National Guardsmen</ORGANIZATION> with automatic rifles patrolled
streets to help police with rescue and to prevent looting. Police
spokesman <PERSON>Tony Santiago</PERSON> said 40 businesses reported looting, much of
which occurred at the height of the storm. Police had arrested 30
people on looting charge, he said.
   <LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION>, Gov. <PERSON>Rafael Hernandez Colon</PERSON> said he would ask the
federal government to declare the island of 3.3 million, a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
commonwealth, a disaster area and seek immediate relief aid.
   Looting by machete-wielding mobs was also reported on the island
of <LOCATION>St. Thomas</LOCATION> in the <LOCATION>U.S. Virgin Islands</LOCATION>.
   Relief officials asked for cots and plastic sheetings to use for
shelters for the thousands of islanders whose homes were crumpled by
<PERSON>Hugo</PERSON>, the fourth hurricane of the season and the first to hit <LOCATION>Puerto
Rico</LOCATION> since <DATE>1956</DATE>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Coast Guard</ORGANIZATION> vessels from <LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION> would scour the waters off
the island because of reports ``there are a lot of people stranded
(on boats) out in the water,'' said <ORGANIZATION>Coast Guard</ORGANIZATION> Lt. <PERSON>Stan Douglas</PERSON>.
   Hugo walloped the northeastern part of the island, then skirted
its populous northern coast on <DATE>Monday</DATE>. It churned on to the
northwest and toward open water. It whirled past but missed the
<LOCATION>Dominican Republic</LOCATION>.
   At least 25 people in the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> died from the storm, said
<PERSON>Cizanette Rivera</PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION>Civil Defense</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION>.
   Two people died on <LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION> while trying to remove a TV
antenna <DATE>Sunday</DATE> in preparation for the storm, according to <PERSON>Maria
Dolores Oronoz</PERSON> of the governor's office. She said no other deaths
had been reported on the island.
   However, <ORGANIZATION>American Red Cross</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>Brian Ruberry</PERSON> said in
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> there were reports of 12 deaths and 100 injuries in
<LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION>, and that three-fourths of the island's residents were
without power.
   Hugo's winds overturned cars, peeled roofs off houses and office
buildings and sent chunks of concrete plunging into streets in <LOCATION>San
Juan</LOCATION>. Fifty airplanes were reported destroyed, mangled into twisted
wrecks at the <LOCATION>Isla Verde</LOCATION> airport.
   In <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>, Secretary of the Interior <PERSON>Manuel Lujan</PERSON> said <MONEY>$500,000</MONEY>
in emergency assistance funds were released to aid storm-stricken
areas of the <LOCATION>U.S. Virgin Islands</LOCATION>.
   Federal teams reached the <LOCATION>U.S. Virgin Islands</LOCATION> to assess damages
<DATE>Tuesday</DATE> before deciding whether to recommend disaster relief.
   Sailboats were blown out of the water and thrown up to 150 feet
on shore in <LOCATION>St. Thomas</LOCATION>, and some waterfront businesses have
disappeared.
   Hugo's itinerary included some of the most idyllic pearls in a
750-mile long necklace of <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> isles, beginning early <DATE>Sunday</DATE>
with the French resort of <LOCATION>Guadeloupe</LOCATION> in the <LOCATION>Leeward Islands</LOCATION>. Five
were killed, 80 injured and more than 10,000 lost their homes there.
   Also damaged were the lush British isle of <LOCATION>Montserrat</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Antigua</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>St. Kitts</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Nevis</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Anguilla</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>British Virgin Islands</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>U.S.
Virgin Islands of St. Croix</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>St. Thomas</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION>.
   Forecasters said it was the region's worst storm in terms of wind
strength since Hurricane <PERSON>David</PERSON>, which killed 1,200 people in the
<LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> in <DATE>1979</DATE>.
   Last year, Hurricane Gilbert walloped the western <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> and
took a southern route through the <LOCATION>Gulf of Mexico</LOCATION>, killing more than
300 people and causing <MONEY>billions of dollars</MONEY> of damage in nine nations.
   Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION>Tropical Storm Iris</ORGANIZATION> was building up, although
forecasters said its strengthening would be slowed by Hugo's wake.
Iris, with 70 mph winds, was about 275 miles northeast of the
<LOCATION>Leeward Islands</LOCATION> on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> and was moving northwest at about 12 mph.
   At <TIME>10:30 p.m.</TIME>, <PERSON>Iris</PERSON> was near latitude 21.3 north, longitude 60.6
west.

   Hurricane Hugo pounded the <LOCATION>U.S.
Virgin Islands</LOCATION> and headed on a collision course with <LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION>
early <DATE>Monday</DATE> after ripping across the northeast <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> with 140
mph winds and leaving at least nine people dead.
   About 80 people were injured on the French island of <LOCATION>Guadeloupe</LOCATION>
and 4,000 were left homeless, French officials said.
   The region's most powerful storm in a decade was expected to plow
into <LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION> early <DATE>Monday</DATE>. The government mobilized the <ORGANIZATION>National
Guard</ORGANIZATION>, and residents rushed for last-minute supplies and taped and
boarded windows.
   At <TIME>3 a.m. EDT</TIME> <DATE>Monday</DATE>, Hugo's center was located near latitude
17.6 degrees north and longitude 64.7 west, about 105 miles
east-southeast of <LOCATION>San Juan</LOCATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION>National Weather Service</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>.
   The storm slowed slightly from 12 mph to 9 mph, the <ORGANIZATION>Weather
Service</ORGANIZATION> said. The <LOCATION>Virgin Islands</LOCATION>' population is 106,000, and <LOCATION>Puerto
Rico</LOCATION> has 3.3 million people.
   Hurricane-force winds of nearly 100 mph ripped away roofs and
knocked out power on <LOCATION>St. Thomas</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>St. Croix</LOCATION>, about 70 miles east
of <LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION>, officials said. Those two islands have most of the
<LOCATION>Virgin Islands</LOCATION>' population.
   Officials said stores in the <LOCATION>St. Croix</LOCATION> town of <LOCATION>Christiansted</LOCATION> were
heavily damaged and there were reports of looting.
   National Guard Adjutant Gen. <PERSON>Robert Moorehead</PERSON> said 1,000 people
were evacuated to rescue shelters in <LOCATION>St. Croix</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Jesse Moore</PERSON>, a meteorologist at the <ORGANIZATION>National Hurricane Center</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, said it was too early to tell if the storm ``will even hit
the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> (mainland). The closest we can forecast it is to
be off the southeastern <LOCATION>Bahamas</LOCATION> by <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>. After that it's
anybody's guess.''
   The storm caused widespread damage early <DATE>Sunday</DATE> as it passed near
<LOCATION>Guadeloupe</LOCATION>. Damage also was reported on the islands of <LOCATION>Martinique</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Antigua</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Dominica</LOCATION>.
   Guadeloupe state radio said five people were killed on that
island. In <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>, French officials said up to five people had been
killed there. Neither report gave further details.
   <PERSON>Gabrielle Carabin</PERSON>, mayor of the village of Le <PERSON>Moule</PERSON> on the
northwestern coast of <LOCATION>Guadeloupe</LOCATION>, said in an interview on the
island's <ORGANIZATION>Radio Caraibe Internationale</ORGANIZATION> that two village residents
were killed. She did not elaborate.
   Beacon Radio in <LOCATION>Anguilla</LOCATION> said one person was killed in <LOCATION>Montserrat</LOCATION>
and two in <LOCATION>Antigua</LOCATION>, but it gave no details.
   In the central <LOCATION>Puerto Rican</LOCATION> town of <LOCATION>Utuado</LOCATION>, a man was
electrocuted when he touched a power line while removing a
television antenna from his roof to prepare for the storm, police
said. He was identified as <PERSON>Antonio Alago Gonzalez</PERSON>, 51.
   In <LOCATION>San Juan</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Port Authority</ORGANIZATION> announced that it closed the
<LOCATION>Munoz Marin International Airport</LOCATION> to all flights at <TIME>6 p.m</TIME>. It said
all international carriers had removed their planes from <LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION>
except for one <ORGANIZATION>American Airlines</ORGANIZATION> A300 left behind for emergencies.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Port Authority</ORGANIZATION> also said cruise ships scheduled to arrive in
<LOCATION>San Juan</LOCATION> had been routed to other destinations.
   A <DATE>Sunday</DATE> morning weather service bulletin said: ``If the eye of
Hurricane Hugo moves across <LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION> as forecast, we expect a
50-mile wide path of extensive to extreme damage to occur.''
   In <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Brian Ruberry</PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION>American Red
Cross</ORGANIZATION>, said late <DATE>Sunday</DATE> that based on projections, the storm could
leave up to 250,000 people homeless on <LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION>.
   Civil defense officials said up to 15,000 people could be
evacuated from flood-prone areas of western <LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION> and hundreds
had already been moved into a sports stadium in <LOCATION>Mayaguez</LOCATION>, the
island's third largest city.
   <ORGANIZATION>National Guardsmen</ORGANIZATION> and volunteers drove through <LOCATION>San Juan</LOCATION>, the
capital, on <DATE>Sunday</DATE> issuing emergency instructions over loudspeakers.
   Gov. <PERSON>Rafael Hernandez Colon</PERSON> flew over the island by helicopter
<DATE>Sunday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME> and told reporters later: ``We are as prepared as we
could be.''
   In a statement on the emergency broadcasting system, the governor
said waves 15 to 20 feet high were expected. He appealed to coastal
residents not living in sturdy homes to move to shelters in hundreds
of churches, schools and other public buildings.
   Reports indicated that the island of <LOCATION>Guadeloupe</LOCATION>, the most
southerly of the <LOCATION>Leeward Islands</LOCATION>, was the hardest hit of the string
of islands forming a 600-mile arc from the <LOCATION>Leewards</LOCATION> to the Greater
Antilles.
   <PERSON>Jocelyne Vandvurdenghe</PERSON>, a French government official in
<LOCATION>Martinique</LOCATION>, said 80 people were reported injured in <LOCATION>Guadeloupe</LOCATION>.
   Hugo slammed into <LOCATION>Guadeloupe</LOCATION>, which has a population of 337,000,
shortly after <TIME>midnight</TIME>, downing power lines and blacking out the
island's 30,700 telephones, state radio and television and and telex
service.
   Officials said many houses and buildings were damaged. The eye of
the storm passed over <LOCATION>St. Francois</LOCATION>, a major tourist area on the
eastern end of the island.
   The mayor of the village of <LOCATION>St. Francois</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Ernest Moutoussamy</PERSON>,
said on <ORGANIZATION>Radio Caraibe Internationale</ORGANIZATION> that ``There's nothing left of
St. Francois.''
   ``Aside from a few houses, almost all the rest were destroyed,''
he said, adding that several tourist hotels, notably the Meridien,
suffered serious damage.
   In <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>, a plane was sent <DATE>Sunday</DATE> with 60 rescue workers and
emergency supplies for <LOCATION>Guadeloupe</LOCATION>, and two more were standing by
waiting for <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> airports to reopen.
   <ORGANIZATION>Catholic Air</ORGANIZATION> announced in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> it was sending clothes, water,
food, and blankets in coordination with the <ORGANIZATION>Red Cross</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>Louis Le Pensec</PERSON>, French minister of overseas terrotories, told a
news conference that his government will provide quick disaster
relief funds to those who lost property.
   The <LOCATION>Virgin Islands</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION> were last hit by a hurricane
in <DATE>1956</DATE> when Hurricane Betsy caused extensive damage.
   Hugo is the fourth hurricane and the eighth named storm of the
<LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> hurricane season, which runs from <DATE>June 1</DATE> to <DATE>Nov. 30</DATE>.
   Forecasters said Hugo was the most powerful storm to hit the
region since Hurricane David in <DATE>1979</DATE>. That storm killed an estimated
1,200 people in the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>.

   Hurricane Hugo quickened its pace toward the <ORGANIZATION>Eastern
Seaboard</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> as residents gathered supplies and made
evacuation plans, while violence and looting broke out on the
shattered islands in the storm's wake.
   President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> ordered <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> troops to <LOCATION>St. Croix</LOCATION> of the <ORGANIZATION>U.S.
Virgin Islands</ORGANIZATION> after <ORGANIZATION>National Guardsmen</ORGANIZATION> and police reportedly joined
prison escapees and others in wild looting. Armed <ORGANIZATION>Coast Guard</ORGANIZATION>
crewmen also went ashore to help restore order.
   Attorney General <PERSON>Dick Thornburgh</PERSON> ordered 100 <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> marshals and
<ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> agents to the island, and <ORGANIZATION>Coast Guard</ORGANIZATION> cutters evacuated
frightened tourists and residents. <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> also authorized troops to
help hurricane-damaged <LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION>.
   Forecasters issued a hurricane watch from <LOCATION>St. Augustine</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla.</LOCATION>, to
<LOCATION>Cape Hatteras</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.C.</LOCATION>, urging coastal residents to begin taking
precautions. Hugo picked up speed over open water and could come
ashore late <DATE>Thursday</DATE> or early <DATE>Friday</DATE>.
   ``I think they're looking at this one with a bit of respect,''
city spokesman <PERSON>Pat Dowling</PERSON> said in <LOCATION>Myrtle Beach</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>S.C.</LOCATION>, as radio and
TV advisories warned: ``Remember the people of <LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION>.''
   Since <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, <PERSON>Hugo</PERSON> has killed at least 25 people, left thousands
homeless and caused hundreds of <MONEY>millions of dollars</MONEY> in damage as it
slashed through the northeastern <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> with wind of 125 to 150
mph.
   Chaos reigned on <ORGANIZATION>St. Croix</ORGANIZATION>, as police and <ORGANIZATION>National Guardsmen</ORGANIZATION>
joined machete-armed mobs on a post-Hugo looting spree. Gunshots
were fired, and ham radio operators heard reports that inmates had
either escaped or been released because of prison damage and were
looting.
   Tourists pleaded with reporters landing on the island to take
them off.
   ``They said, `Please get food! Please get water! Please help us!
They're looting. We've seen police looting. We've seen <ORGANIZATION>National
Guard</ORGANIZATION> looting. There's no law and order here,''' said <PERSON>Gary Williams</PERSON>,
a reporter for the San Juan daily <ORGANIZATION>El Nuevo Dia</ORGANIZATION>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Coast Guard</ORGANIZATION> had six ships in the area and sent armed
crewmen from the cutter Bear ashore to help restore order.
   ``Our shore party went ashore and basically determined there was
a complete breakdown of authority. There's a very high indication
that innocent people are going to get hurt in an act of violence
there,'' Lt. <PERSON>Jeff Karonis</PERSON> said in <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>.
   The crew was evacuating ``all people from the island who fear for
their safety,'' the <ORGANIZATION>Coast Guard</ORGANIZATION> said in a statement. A cargo plane
was ready to supplement the evacuation if needed.
   Tourists sat on the porch of the <ORGANIZATION>King Christian Hotel</ORGANIZATION>, protected
by hotel employees carrying shotguns.
   ``It was horrendous,'' said <PERSON>Rose Hertzog</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Northampton</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pa.</LOCATION>, who
waited out the storm in a hotel laundry room. ``I thought we were
going to die.
   Thornburgh ordered the 100 marshals and <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> agents to protect
federal officials and property, as well as help bolster local law
enforcement, said <PERSON>David Runkel</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Justice Department</ORGANIZATION> spokesman in
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>. A small team of <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> agents was sent in first to set up a
command post.
   The <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON>Alexander Farrelly</PERSON>, governor of the <ORGANIZATION>U.S.
Virgin Islands</ORGANIZATION>, asked <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> to authorize use of troops to restore
order on <ORGANIZATION>St. Croix</ORGANIZATION>, but <LOCATION>Farrelly</LOCATION> on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> denied making
that request.
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> declared the <LOCATION>U.S. Virgin Islands</LOCATION> a disaster
area and a <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> spokesman said a similar declaration was
expected soon for <LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION>, which suffered widespread damage.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Coast Guard</ORGANIZATION> sent cutters to <LOCATION>St. Thomas</LOCATION> to pick up personnel
and their families whose homes were destroyed. It also was
evacuating 200 American medical students at <LOCATION>Montserrat</LOCATION>, a British
colony where Hugo damaged nearly <PERCENT>90 percent</PERCENT> of the homes.
   Federal relief shipments laden with supplies and rescue workers
from <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Guantanamo Bay</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION>, went to <LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION>, while British and French forces helped
<LOCATION>Montserrat</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Guadeloupe</LOCATION>.
   At <TIME>3 a.m. EDT</TIME> <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, Hugo's center was about 450 miles
southeast of <LOCATION>Savannah</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ga.</LOCATION>, at 28.2 degrees north latitude and 75.2
degrees west longitude, and was moving northwest at 17 mph, up from
12 mph earlier in the day.
   Hugo's wind speed also rose from 105 to 110 mph <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, but
forecasters said little further strengthening was likely.
   Forecasters said Hugo's path made residents from <LOCATION>Savannah</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ga.</LOCATION>,
to <LOCATION>Charleston</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>S.C.</LOCATION>, most likely to be in harm's way, but they were
delaying issuing hurricane warnings until they could make better
projections.
   Bob Sheets, director of the <ORGANIZATION>National Hurricane Center</ORGANIZATION>, said
officials didn't want to spur ``a cry-wolf syndrome'' by triggering
premature evacuation of the resort and retiree communities. But
forecasters said they hoped <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> residents learned from Hugo's
<LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> rampage.
   ``When those islands got pounded like they did, that's
remarkable,'' forecaster <PERSON>Martin Nelson</PERSON> said of the relatively low
death toll. ``We gave them a lot of warning, and they apparently
took the warnings.''
   <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> coastal residents have enough time to prepare, he said.
   ``Let's hope they are,'' <PERSON>Nelson</PERSON> said. ``If later on, they say
`Boy, you sure got that wrong,' that's OK. We'd rather that happen
than have people wake up at <TIME>2 a.m.</TIME> and find a hurricane coming.''
   <LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON>Carroll Campell</PERSON> put state law enforcement
agencies on alert. `All we can do is to watch now and to wait,'' he
said.
   In <LOCATION>Charleston</LOCATION>, the historic <ORGANIZATION>City Hall</ORGANIZATION> was boarded up and school
children were told to stay home <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   Officials said coastal residents seemed to be taking the right
steps, such as storing emergency supplies and buying materials for
boarding up.
   ``They're buying me out of all my candles, tape, flashlights,
propane fuel, oil and lamps,'' said <PERSON>Tim Brindley</PERSON>, merchandise
manager of K mart in <LOCATION>Mount Pleasant</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>S.C.</LOCATION>
   ``I see a lot of people buying water and canned goods like pork
and beans. It's been pretty steady,'' said <PERSON>Bryan Raleigh</PERSON>, manager of
the Market Street Food Lion in <LOCATION>Wilmington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.C.</LOCATION>, where nearby
<LOCATION>Carolina Beach</LOCATION> suffered <MONEY>$90 million</MONEY> in damages when hit by Hurricane
Diana in <DATE>1984</DATE>.
   Some took extra precautions.
   ``We're going to church a lot,'' said <PERSON>Dean S. Phillips</PERSON>, town
manager in <LOCATION>Bethany Beach</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Del</LOCATION>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> sent its Charleston-based ships to sea to avoid Hugo,
while crews were called <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> to their ships at <LOCATION>Mayport Naval
Station</LOCATION> near <LOCATION>Jacksonville</LOCATION> for a possible move out.
   ``Like the Boy Scouts, we're prepared,'' said Chief Petty Officer
Art <PERSON>Riccio</PERSON>.
   Adminstrators at the <ORGANIZATION>Florida School</ORGANIZATION> for the Deaf and Blind sent
home 400 children living in dormitories. ``The decision was to
assume the worst and plan accordingly,'' said <PERSON>Mary Jane Dillon</PERSON>, a
school spokeswoman.
   Bahamians, meanwhile, watched as the hurricane moved away with
little impact.
   ``It's a great sigh of relief for all of us in the <LOCATION>Bahamas</LOCATION>,''
said meteorologist <PERSON>Michael Stubbs</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Nassau</LOCATION>. ``Most people want to
be able to enjoy the sea and sunshine here, and now they can.''
   Meanwhile, forecasters said <ORGANIZATION>Tropical Storm Iris</ORGANIZATION> was being
weakened because of its proximity to Hugo, but could cause more
problems for the Hugo-hit islands.
   ``Satellite pictures show an area of thunderstorms extends south
of the center into the extreme northeastern <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION>,'' forecaster
<PERSON>Gil Clark</PERSON> said. ``Unfortunately, this activity will be moving
westward over an area that was struck by Hurricane Hugo just three
days ago.''
   At <TIME>10:30 p.m.</TIME>, <PERSON>Iris</PERSON> was near latitude 22.0 north and longitude
64.0 west, or 250 miles north-northeast of <LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION>. Its winds
were down to 45 mph as the storm moved west-northwest at around 12
mph.

   At <TIME>6 p.m. EDT</TIME>, forecasters said the latest satellite pictures

<TEXT>
   The start of the <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> hurricane
season this week is a time of anxiety for many victims of last
year's Hurricane Hugo.
   ``A lot of people are just barely back on their feet, if they
are at all, and the thought that something like this could happen
again is just frightening to them,'' said <PERSON>Veronique Aniel</PERSON>, a
counselor with the statewide Hurricane Hugo Outreach Program.
   The hurricane season begins <DATE>Friday</DATE> and runs through <DATE>Nov. 30</DATE>.
   Hurricane Hugo smashed ashore last <DATE>Sept. 21</DATE> with 135 mph wind
and a 19-foot storm surge that caused an estimated <MONEY>$5.9 billion</MONEY>
damage and killed 29 people in <LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION>. While most
structures in <LOCATION>Charleston</LOCATION> have been cleaned and repaired, recovery
in outlying areas has taken longer.
   Officials of the state <ORGANIZATION>Department of Mental Health</ORGANIZATION>, which
operates the outreach program, say as many as 20,000 <LOCATION>South
Carolinians</LOCATION> suffering post-traumatic stress syndrome are expected
to develop long-term psychological problems as a result of the
storm.
   ``We're anticipating stress because of the anniversary coming up
and because of the hurricane season starting,'' said <PERSON>Linda Lane</PERSON>, a
counselor in <LOCATION>Berkeley County</LOCATION>, one of the outlying areas hard-hit by
the storm.
   ``We have children who are having difficulty in school when the
rain or wind is blowing more than normal,'' she said.
   Some people will experience fear when the weather is similar to
those before the storm, said <PERSON>Dr. Michael Foxworth</PERSON>, a psychiatrist
who is medical director at <ORGANIZATION>Charter Hospital of Charleston</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``I think the emotional damage a person suffered in Hugo
probably relates ... primarily to the duration of time their lives
were totally out of their control,'' he said.
   ``The person who had time to evacuate and get to a safe place
and then pretty quickly returned to their normal environment
suffered less psychological impact than those who were totally
without resources,'' he said.
   <PERSON>Foxworth</PERSON> said people will be watching weather reports and
tracking hurricanes more closely this year.
   Before Hugo there was a sense of denial about hurricanes, a
feeling that ``it can't happen here,'' he said.
   ``Now that it has, things swing the other way and it becomes a
sense of expectancy that it will happen again ... even though the
odds are probably no greater this year than before Hugo,'' he said.
   Some people say they will leave <LOCATION>Charleston</LOCATION> and never return if
another storm hits, <PERSON>Ms. Aniel</PERSON> said. Others deny another storm could
even happen.
   ``Some people don't even want to talk about it. They want to
ignore the fact. If another one comes this way, what will these
people do?'' she said.
   But the fact <LOCATION>Charleston</LOCATION> has recently been hit by a storm would
make a future evacuation easier.
   ``You've experienced a bad hurricane and it's fresh in people's
minds,'' said <PERSON>Mark Zimmer</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>National Hurricane Center</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Coral
Gables</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla.</LOCATION> ``There won't be any difficulty convincing people it's
a real threat.''

   With Hurricane Hugo heading toward the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> mainland, cruise
lines emptied their ships of passengers and ``hauled tail'' out of
port. Florida residents jammed the phone lines of insurance
companies for financial protection.
   The eastern <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION>'s strongest storm in 10 years churned
toward the <LOCATION>Bahamas</LOCATION> today after scouring <LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION> with 125 mph
winds, leaving tens of thousands of people homeless.
   Early computer predictions indicated the storm was likely to hit
the <LOCATION>East Coast</LOCATION> late in the week, and officials told coastal
residents to familiarize themselves with emergency procedures.
   ``Hurricane Hugo has the potential of being the worst storm to
affect the Southeast coast since <PERSON>David</PERSON> hit the <LOCATION>Georgia-South
Carolina</LOCATION> coast in <DATE>1979</DATE>,'' said <PERSON>John Purvis</PERSON>, director of the
<ORGANIZATION>Southeast Regional Climate Center</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Columbia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>S.C.</LOCATION>
   Workers at the <ORGANIZATION>Kennedy Space Center</ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION>Cape Canaveral</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla.</LOCATION>,
began preparing to roll the space shuttle Atlantis from its launch
pad into a building in case Hugo comes too close.
   In addition, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> decided to drain the fuel from an Atlas-Centaur
rocket carrying a <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> satellite, postponing the launch from <DATE>Friday</DATE>
to at least <DATE>Sunday</DATE>.
   Preparations were being made to remove the satellite, but <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>
said <DATE>today</DATE> that no decision on moving it or the shuttle would be
made until <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
   Cruise lines in <LOCATION>San Juan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION>, quickly unloaded
passengers, changed itineraries and sent passengerless liners out to
sea after Hugo's winds began to rake the island <DATE>Sunday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME>.
   ``We hauled tail and got out of there,'' said <PERSON>Rich Steck</PERSON>, a
spokesman for <ORGANIZATION>Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines</ORGANIZATION>, which canceled this
week's trip on the <ORGANIZATION>Sun Viking</ORGANIZATION> and ended last week's tour a day
early, bringing 444 passengers into <LOCATION>San Juan</LOCATION> on <DATE>Saturday</DATE>.
   ``As soon as the people were off, we took out to sea with just
crew on board,'' <PERSON>Steck</PERSON> said in <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>. ``Ships are built to ride in
rough water. Its natural element is the sea. We'll just go as far as
we can get from it and then turn around and face it.''
   <ORGANIZATION>Royal Caribbean</ORGANIZATION> offered passengers on the canceled trip free
tickets and <MONEY>$200</MONEY> spending money on a later cruise, <PERSON>Steck</PERSON> said.
   <ORGANIZATION>Carnival Cruise Lines</ORGANIZATION> diverted the Celebration, which which
normally carries up to 1,800 passengers on weeklong trips through
<LOCATION>San Juan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>St. Thomas</LOCATION> and the eastern <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION>, toward <LOCATION>Jamaica</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>.
   Carnival was watching Hugo's development closely before deciding
whether to divert the <ORGANIZATION>Carnivale</ORGANIZATION>, which left <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> on <DATE>Monday</DATE> with
about 1,000 passengers on a four-day trip to the <LOCATION>Bahamas</LOCATION>, spokesman
<PERSON>Tim Gallagher</PERSON> said.
   Days before possible hurricane watches or warnings for the <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>
area, some insurance agents already have issued a warning of their
own: It's now too late to get flood insurance protection for Hugo.
   ``If someone comes in and wants to add flood insurance, there's a
five-day waiting period,'' said <PERSON>James Berhardt</PERSON>, a State Farm agent.
   Agents for other companies said the hurricane was fast
approaching the point beyond which they would issue no more
increases in property insurance.
   Independent agent <PERSON>John Handeman</PERSON> of south <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> said once any
hurricane crosses 15 degrees north latitude and 72 degrees west
latitude, he won't sell homeowners increased coverage. <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> is at
about 80 degrees west longitude.
   Early today, Hugo's center already had passed the threshold.
   At <TIME>2 a.m. EDT</TIME>, its center was near 20.7 degrees north latitude
and 67.3 degrees west longitude, moving north northwest at 12 mph.
   <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION> officials were
hoping Hugo would give them enough warning before bringing high
winds to the launch site at <LOCATION>Cape Canaveral</LOCATION>.
   According to <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s contingency plan, officials will order a
rollback of the Atlantis if they receive a forecast that
hurricane-force winds will arrive at the cape within 72 hours.
   By <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>, the <ORGANIZATION>National Weather Service</ORGANIZATION> estimated there was
only an <PERCENT>8 percent</PERCENT> chance that hurricane force winds would hit <LOCATION>Cape
Canaveral</LOCATION> before <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>evening</TIME>.
   But because the shuttle can move at only 1 mph, the journey back
to the assembly building takes six hours, leaving little room for
error.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> said that if caught by high winds it could secure the
shuttle and its cargo, the nuclear-powered <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> space probe, on
the launch pad to ride out any storm.
   A return to the hangar would certainly mean a delay in the
scheduled <DATE>Oct. 12</DATE> launch of Atlantis, but <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> has until late
<DATE>November</DATE> to send the probe on its six-year voyage to the planet
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>.

   A tropical storm in the <LOCATION>Gulf of Mexico</LOCATION> showed signs
of growing into a hurricane <DATE>Friday</DATE>, threatening to swamp coastal
areas already facing abnormally high tides and prompting the
evacuation of offshore oil rigs.
   Tropical Storm <PERSON>Jerry</PERSON>, which developed rapidly from a tropical
depression off the Mexican coast on <DATE>Friday</DATE>, had maximum sustained
winds of 70 mph and appeared to be gaining intensity, according to
the <ORGANIZATION>National Hurricane Center</ORGANIZATION> in suburban <LOCATION>Coral Gables</LOCATION>.
   The center issued a hurricane watch from <LOCATION>Port Arthur</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, to
the mouth of the <LOCATION>Mississippi River</LOCATION>. A hurricane warning for
portions of the watch area was likely to be issued <DATE>Saturday</DATE>.
   At <TIME>10:30 p.m. EDT</TIME> <DATE>Friday</DATE>, the center of <PERSON>Jerry</PERSON> was located at
24.5 north latitude and 93.6 west longitude, or about 425 miles
south-southwest of <LOCATION>New Orleans</LOCATION>, and moving north at 13 mph.
   Oil companies began evacuating offshore rigs and platforms early
in the day, officials said in <LOCATION>New Orleans</LOCATION>. More than 4,000 workers
in the gulf were to be be brought ashore by helicopter and ship.
   ``We started as soon as it became a tropical storm,'' said <PERSON>Wendy
Jacobs</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Shell Oil</ORGANIZATION>. ``Everyone knows you don't take any chances
with these.''
   The hurricane center advised <ORGANIZATION>Gulf Coast</ORGANIZATION> residents and marine
operations to closely monitor advisories on the storm.
   ``At the moment, <LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION> appears to be in the greatest danger,
but the storm could turn over the <DATE>weekend</DATE>,'' said forecaster
<PERSON>Gilbert Clark</PERSON>. A coastal flood watch was issued for the <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> coast.
   Rough seas from <PERSON>Jerry</PERSON> also may coincide with an unusual
astronomical phenomenon that is expected to elevate average tides
to a 10-year high, said <PERSON>Clark</PERSON>.
   The moon, which raises tides with its gravitational pull, will
be both full and at its closest point to the earth next week. In
addition, the moon's orbit is over the <LOCATION>Northern Hemisphere</LOCATION>, which
adds to its affect on the seas.
   <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> said tides could be up to a foot higher in the Gulf and
more in the open ocean.
   ``A situation likes this happens about once every decade,'' he
said. ``But it also has the reverse affect. Low tides will be at
their lowest.''
   Jerry is the strongest tropical weather system since Hurricane
Hugo ravaged the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> and coastal <LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION> <DATE>last month</DATE>.
   Tropical depressions become named tropical storms when maximum
sustained winds reach 39 mph. Hurricanes are declared when winds
hit 74 mph. The <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> hurricane season runs from <DATE>June</DATE> to
<DATE>November</DATE>.

   Supercomputers, satellites and the expertise of
several hurricane forecasters predicted the destructive path
Hurricane Hugo would follow, giving people plenty of time to flee
the <LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION> coast.
   But hurricane tracking remains an uncertain science.
   Forecasters at the <ORGANIZATION>National Hurricane Center</ORGANIZATION> used computer models
to track Hugo's path into <LOCATION>Charleston</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>S.C.</LOCATION>
   ``All the world's knowledge about meteorological conditions and
forecasting changes in those conditions is embodied in those
models,'' said <PERSON>Thomas Pyke</PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION>National Oceanic</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Atmospheric
Administration</ORGANIZATION>'s satellite service.
   Pinpointing the exact point of Hugo's landfall was difficult, but
forecasters said <DATE>Friday</DATE> that the landfall was predicted in time for
evacuation.
   ``Overall, I think the tracking models gave us a very good idea
where Hugo would be so officials in <LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION> could act in a
timely manner,'' said research meteorologist <PERSON>Colin McAdie</PERSON>.
   The real forecasting problem with Hugo was predicting the
intensity of the storm, which was upgraded to a Category 4 hurricane
just hours before it slammed into <LOCATION>Charleston</LOCATION>.
   ``It is very difficult to predict changes in intensity because we
don't have very reliable computer models for that,'' <PERSON>McAdie</PERSON> said.
``We really need to improve on our forecasting ability of strength.''
   The hurricane specialists were surprised by the last-minute
increase in wind speed, which was reported to them by <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION>
reconnaissance.
   Hurricane specialist <PERSON>Gil Clark</PERSON>, who has tracked hurricanes for 35
years, said that a couple of decades ago, the only forecasting tools
were reports from aircraft or ships.
   ``We had no radar or satellites then, so needless to say our
forecasts were less accurate,'' <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> said.
   In the <DATE>late 1960s</DATE>, the weather service began using satellites to
obtain a global weather picture. Information from the satellite is
used to improve the accuracy of the large-scale models that
television viewers see every night.
   Using the information from the satellite, supercomputers at the
<ORGANIZATION>National Meteorological Center</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Suitland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Md.</LOCATION>, send information to
the hurricane center where a tracking model constantly changes to
account for current weather conditions and the position of the
hurricane.
   To determine the track of the storm, the forecasters analyze
supercomputer predictions, satellite data, the history of similar
storms and the current path of the hurricane.
   Then they make an educated guess about the landfall.
   Meteorology professor <PERSON>Kerry A. Emmanuel</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Massachussetts
Institute of Technology</ORGANIZATION> criticizes the current forecasting system.
   ``<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> and the American people are suffering from the
collective delusion that our data problems have been solved by
satellites and that just isn't true,'' <PERSON>Emmanuel</PERSON> said.
   Satellites can give a ``pretty picture,'' he said, but not enough
information about the wind and temperatures that affect a
hurricane's path.
   ``Most of the information actually used to predict hurricanes
comes from flying airplanes into the hurricane, and they do a very
good job,'' <PERSON>Emmanuel</PERSON> said.
   Forecasters say the accuracy of satellite pictures is improving
every year so long-range forecasting should become more precise.
   ``We have to remember that those models used are only guidance
products,'' <PERSON>Pyke</PERSON> said, ``and that it's ultimately the job of the
forecaster to predict the storm's path.''

   Amid the uproar of live coverage by the
major networks and scores of other media organizations, <ORGANIZATION>National
Hurricane Center</ORGANIZATION> forecasters went about their business of monitoring
Hurricane Hugo.
   ``The whole system looks chaotic, but it works,'' said <PERSON>Bob
Sheets</PERSON>, the center's director.
   On one side of a large room dominated by a U-shaped bank of
monitoring equipment were the forecasters, making meticulous
calculations about where the deadly hurricane will strike and
getting emergency operations going in those areas.
   On the other side were the media _ a pack of reporters, camera
operators and technicians, jockeying for seconds of Sheets' time and
tidbits of his expertise.
   In the center was Sheets himself. Surrounded by cameras, wires
and two dozen journalists with pads and telephones, the ubiquitous
red-headed meteorologist has appeared on television all week next to
a large satellite monitor showing colorful images of Hurricane Hugo.
   During prime news time, competing technicians and cameramen shout
and make rude hand gestures for people to get out of their shots of
Sheets.
   At his back, casually dressed forecasters who have been working
12-hour days tracked the storm via computers and satellites.
   ``We obviously don't like this and could probably do a better
job, but everyone knows now because of the media,'' said hurricane
specialist <PERSON>Max Mayfield</PERSON>. ``In the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION>, we were not so certain
the word got out. But we know the <LOCATION>Carolinas</LOCATION> have been evacuated.''
   When a hurricane warning goes into effect, ``It's a <MONEY>$50 million</MONEY>
statement,'' said meteorologist <PERSON>Joel Cline</PERSON>, referring to the cost of
emergency preparations and evacuation plans that must be implemented
when the warning is posted.
   ``If we weren't here, then you wouldn't know that a storm was out
there,'' he said. Before the hurricane warning system was
established, a storm of Hugo's power would have cost thousands of
lives. But <DATE>early today</DATE>, after days of warnings and proper evacuation
procedures, there were no immediate reports of deaths despite
widespread damage in <LOCATION>Charleston</LOCATION> and other coastal areas of <LOCATION>South
Carolina</LOCATION>.
   ``I like to think that we make a difference a far as human lives
are concerned,'' <PERSON>Cline</PERSON> said.
   After Hugo's landfall, Sheets and the other forecasters began to
wind down from the hectic pace they had maintained for the last
several days. But, he warned, the hurricane center still is
following three other weather systems that have moved into the
<LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> between the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>, and another storm in
the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION>.
   ``I hate to say we're breathing a sigh of relief because people
are getting clobbered to death,'' meteorologist <PERSON>Mark Zimmer</PERSON> said as
the storm pounded <LOCATION>Charleston</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>S.C.</LOCATION> ``But we've done all we can.''

<HEAD>Hurricane Hugo Hits Puerto Rico</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Hurricane Hugo brushed across <LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION> on <DATE>Monday</DATE>, bringing
sustained winds near 125 mph and heavy rain, causing extensive
damage and interfering with communications.
   Hugo, the most powerful storm to strike the region in a decade,
was blamed for at least 14 deaths.
   Meteorologist <PERSON>Jesse Moore</PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION>National Hurricane Center</ORGANIZATION> said
it was too early to tell if Hugo would strike the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> mainland. He
said it was expected to be off the southeastern Bahamas by <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>
and ``after that, it's anybody's guess.''
   Behind Hugo, Tropical Storm Iris was about 300 miles from the
Lesser Antilles with a maximum sustained wind speed of around 50
mph. Strengthening was not expected because of the proximity of Hugo.
   Elsewhere, showers and thunderstorms were widespread across much
of the <LOCATION>Florida Peninsula</LOCATION>, south of a frontal system in very warm
humid air. Hail the size of golf balls pelted <LOCATION>Amelia Island</LOCATION> during
the morning, the <ORGANIZATION>National Weather Service</ORGANIZATION> said. A tornado was
reported at <LOCATION>Fernandina Beach</LOCATION> near <LOCATION>Amelia Island</LOCATION>, the weather service
said.
   Showers and thunderstorms were scattered over the central <LOCATION>Pacific
Coast</LOCATION> and into the northern Rockies as low pressure in the upper
atmosphere developed over <LOCATION>Northern California</LOCATION>. Street flooding was
reported in parts of <LOCATION>Sacramento</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, the weather service said.
   Temperatures around the nation at <TIME>3 p.m. EDT</TIME> ranged from 38
degrees at <LOCATION>Truckee</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, to 94 at <LOCATION>Brownsville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>. <DATE>Monday</DATE>'s
low in the Lower 48 states was 30 at both <PERSON>Burns</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Redmond</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ore</LOCATION>.
   For <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, widespread showers and isolated thunderstorms were
forecast from central and <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION> into <LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION> and
central <LOCATION>South Dakota</LOCATION>. Scattered showers and thunderstorms were
forecast from <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> across the southern and middle <LOCATION>Atlantic Coast</LOCATION>.
   Highs only in the 60s were predicted across the <LOCATION>Pacific
Northwest</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>Great Basin of Nevada</LOCATION> and western <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION>, and the
northern parts of <LOCATION>New England</LOCATION>; in the low to mid 90s across much of
<LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>; and in the 70s or 80s across much of the rest of the nation.

   Hurricane Hugo ripped across resort
islands of the eastern <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> on <DATE>Sunday</DATE> with winds up to 140 mph,
ripping away rooftops, uprooting trees and leaving an estimated
3,000 people homeless on the island of <LOCATION>Guadeloupe</LOCATION>.
   Forecasters described Hugo as ``extremely dangerous'' as it
churned toward <LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION> and said it could be the most powerful
hurricane to hit the region since Hurricane David in <DATE>1979</DATE>. That
storm killed an estimated 1,200 people in the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>.
   At <TIME>9 a.m. EDT</TIME>, Hugo's center was located near latitude 16.6 north
and longitude 62.7 west, about 250 miles east-southeast of <LOCATION>San Juan</LOCATION>,
said the <ORGANIZATION>National Weather Service</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>.
   Hugo was moving west-northwest at 12 mph and was expected to hit
the <LOCATION>Virgin Islands</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION> on <DATE>Sunday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> or early <DATE>Monday</DATE>,
the weather service said. Hurricane warnings were in effect for
islands throughout the region.
   ``All preparedness actions should be rushed to completion in the
warned areas,'' the weather service said in its <TIME>9 a.m.</TIME> weather
bulletin.
   The storm slammed into the French island of <LOCATION>Guadeloupe</LOCATION>, about 350
miles east-southeast of <LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION>, just after <TIME>midnight</TIME> <DATE>Sunday</DATE>.
   Phone circuits to affected islands were either busy or jammed
early <DATE>Sunday</DATE> and it could not be immediately determined if the storm
caused any casualties on the island of 340,000 people.
   <PERSON>Jean-Claude Roure</PERSON>, a government official on <LOCATION>Martinique</LOCATION>, told
French radio there were no reports of deaths of serious injuries on
<LOCATION>Guadeloupe</LOCATION> but that it appeared about 3,000 people were left
homeless. <LOCATION>Martinique</LOCATION> is about 100 miles south of <LOCATION>Guadeloupe</LOCATION>.
   Roure reported heavy damage to buildings and said the airport
control tower in the city of Pointe-a-Pitre was ``partially
destroyed.''
   ``Since people can't move around and almost all communications
are cut, it is possible there's more information that has not been
passed along,'' he said.
   He said it appeared that La Desirade, an island of about 1,600
people 22 miles east of <LOCATION>Guadeloupe</LOCATION>, may have been the hardest hit so
far but that all communications with it were cut.
   The director of civil security at the <ORGANIZATION>French Interior Ministry</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Hubert Fournier</PERSON>, said emergency supplies and personnel were
being prepared to be sent to <LOCATION>Guadeloupe</LOCATION> as soon as it was known what
was needed.
   Rainfall of up to 10 inches was expected in the path of the
hurricane, producing flash floods and possible mud slides in hilly
regions, the <ORGANIZATION>National Weather Service</ORGANIZATION> said. It warned residents in
mountainous areas to move to safer locations.
   Storm surges up to eight feet above normal were expected in
coastal areas, forecasters said.
   In <LOCATION>Dominica</LOCATION> to the south of <LOCATION>Guadeloupe</LOCATION>, there were power outages
on the island's north side where strong winds uprooted trees,
<LOCATION>France</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>RFO</ORGANIZATION> radio said.
   In <LOCATION>Antigua</LOCATION>, just north of <LOCATION>Guadeloupe</LOCATION>, heavy rain and very strong
winds also uprooting trees were reported. Authorities there turned
off power to the entire island of 100,000 people as a precautionary
measure shortly before <TIME>midnight</TIME>.
   The radio reported flooding in low-lying areas but provided no
details. It said dozens of people were moved to shelters. At the
plush <ORGANIZATION>St. James Club</ORGANIZATION> hotel, on the island's southeastern side,
guests were evacuated.
   In the British dependency of <LOCATION>Montserrat</LOCATION>, northwest of <LOCATION>Guadeloupe</LOCATION>
and directly in Hugo's path, <PERSON>Joe Dominique</PERSON>, editor at Radio
Antilles, said the storm blew down trees and ripped away galvanized
rooftops of several homes in the capital, <LOCATION>Plymouth</LOCATION>, early <DATE>Sunday</DATE>.
   Hugo is the eighth named storm of the current <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> hurricane
season, which runs from <DATE>June 1</DATE> to <DATE>Nov. 30</DATE>.

<TEXT>
   The <DATE>1990</DATE> Atlantic hurricane season
begins today amid dire warnings that killer storms on the <LOCATION>East</LOCATION> and
<ORGANIZATION>Gulf</ORGANIZATION> coasts in the <DATE>last two years</DATE> may have been harbingers of a new
era of destructive storms.
   The hurricane season runs until <DATE>Nov. 30</DATE> and was ushered in by a
tropical depression last week in the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> that brought heavy
rain to <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION> and south <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> but did not intensify into a
hurricane.
   Many coastal communities, with swelling populations, are
ill-prepared to handle a hurricane emergency, said <PERSON>Robert Sheets</PERSON>,
director of the <ORGANIZATION>National Hurricane Center</ORGANIZATION>.
   A recent <ORGANIZATION>National Oceanic</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Atmospheric Administration</ORGANIZATION> report
predicts the number of people in seaside counties from <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION> to
<LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> will grow <PERCENT>60 percent</PERCENT>, counting from <DATE>1960</DATE> until <DATE>2010</DATE>. Some
states such as <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> will experience near <PERCENT>200 percent</PERCENT>
growth during the period, the report said.
   ``What we're looking at is the possibility of greater destruction
and greater loss of life,'' Sheets said <DATE>Thursday</DATE>. ``We can't stop
the hurricanes. The only thing we can do is work on better
preparedness and emergency planning.''
   The aftermath from Hurricane Gilbert in <DATE>1988</DATE> and Hugo <DATE>last year</DATE>
taught officials what improvements are needed to better evacuate and
protect the estimated 45 million coastal residents from <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION> to
<LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, Sheets said.
   ``If the long-term trends are any indication of what's to come,
we are in for more frequent and stronger hurricanes,'' said Sheets.
   Gilbert killed more than 300 people and caused heavy damage from
the Lesser Antilles to <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>. Hugo killed 28 people in the eastern
<LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> and 29 more in <LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION> and caused a record <MONEY>$10
billion</MONEY> in damage.
   Sheets said the predictions of increased hurricane activity are
based on studies of past decades, atmospheric low-pressure waves and
increased rainfall trends in <LOCATION>West Africa</LOCATION>, near the breeding waters
for most hurricanes.
   Hurricane activity started dropping after drought conditions
began in the early <DATE>1960s</DATE> in <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>'s Sahel region, he said.
   Between <DATE>1940</DATE> and <DATE>1969</DATE>, the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> was hit by 22 hurricanes
with minimum winds of 110 mph. From <DATE>1970 to 1989</DATE>, there were only
eight such storms, including Hugo, Sheets said.
   ``I hope we don't catch up this year with the decade of the
<DATE>'40s</DATE>,'' he said.
   There are five categories of hurricanes, ranging from Category 1,
which has top sustained winds of 74 mph to 95 mph, to Category 5,
with top winds greater then 155 mph.
   Both <PERSON>Gilbert</PERSON> and Hugo reached category 5, according to
meteorologist <PERSON>Barry Fatchwell</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>National Hurricane Center</ORGANIZATION>.
   Sheets praised most <LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION> officials' response to Hugo,
but said some leaders ``didn't have their proverbial act together''
and lives may have been saved.
   Also, he said Hugo showed inadequacies in the Emergency Broadcast
System and some communities used emergency shelters ill-suited to
withstand a powerful hurricane.
   In the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION>, officials have worked to improve communications
systems after links were cut by <PERSON>Gilbert</PERSON>.

<TEXT>
   Hundreds of workers fled oil rigs in the <LOCATION>Gulf
of Mexico</LOCATION> as Tropical Storm <PERSON>Jerry</PERSON> inched toward the coasts of <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>
and <LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION>.
   A hurricane watch was issued <TIME>this morning</TIME> for the coast from
<LOCATION>Port Arthur</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, to the mouth of the <LOCATION>Mississippi River</LOCATION>, with
landfall somewhere along that area forecast for <DATE>Sunday</DATE> at the
earliest.
   The storm weakened slightly <TIME>this morning</TIME> and also was found to
be farther away from land than first thought and moving more
slowly, said forecasters at the <ORGANIZATION>National Hurricane Center</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Coral
Gables</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla</LOCATION>.
   Jerry developed rapidly from a tropical depression off the
Mexican coast and by early today had maximum sustained winds of 70
mph. By <TIME>late morning</TIME>, though, the winds had eased to 65 mph.
   Forecasters said conditions were not favorable for a major
increase in storm strength, but noted that even a relatively slight
increase could bring the storm up to hurricane strength, defined as
74 mph or more.
   Evacuations from the oil rigs began early <DATE>Friday</DATE>, soon after
<PERSON>Jerry</PERSON> reached tropical storm strength in the southwestern gulf,
stirring up rough seas. Officials said more than 4,000 workers
would be brought to shore if the rigs were all shut down.
   ``We started as soon as it became a tropical storm,'' <ORGANIZATION>Shell Oil</ORGANIZATION>
spokeswoman <PERSON>Wendy Jacobs</PERSON> said. ``Everyone knows you don't take any
chances with these.''
   At noon EDT <DATE>today</DATE>, <PERSON>Jerry</PERSON>'s center was near 24.9 north latitude
and 93.1 west longitude, about 400 miles south southwest of <LOCATION>New
Orleans</LOCATION>. The storm was moving north at 6 mph, more slowly than
forecasters thought earlier in the day.
   The system's rough seas could coincide with unusually high tides
expected all week because of an unusual alignment of the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, Sun
and <PERSON>Moon</PERSON>.
   Tides through <DATE>Friday</DATE> were expected to peak at their highest
levels in a decade, <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> said, perhaps a foot above their usual
highs in the gulf.
   Jerry is the strongest tropical weather system since Hurricane
Hugo ravaged the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> and coastal <LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION> <DATE>last month</DATE>.
The storm, which killed 33 in the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> and 29 on the mainland
<LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, hit <LOCATION>Charleston</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>S.C.</LOCATION>, late <DATE>Sept. 21</DATE>.
   Storm preparations were under way along the gulf coast.
   On <LOCATION>Grand Island</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>La.</LOCATION>, in the gulf south of <LOCATION>New Orleans</LOCATION>,
officials readied evacuation plans for 2,000 residents.
   ``We just have to play it hour-by-hour and see what happens, but
when there's a storm in the Gulf it kind of raises everybody's
hackles a bit,'' said <PERSON>Pete Picou</PERSON>, civil defense director of <PERSON>Cameron
Parish</PERSON> on the southwestern <LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION> coast. ``Down here you can't
ever take them for granted.''

   Giant Hurricane Gabrielle, its tail winds swamping
homes and businesses as far south as <LOCATION>Barbados</LOCATION>, may have reached peak
force as its swirling clouds spread further over the <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION>,
forecasters said <DATE>late Tuesday</DATE>.
   Experts, however, said it was too early to draw conclusions from
<ORGANIZATION>U.S. Air Force</ORGANIZATION> reconnaissance plane readings of rising barometric
pressure and a slightly expanding eye in the hurricane, which
brushed by the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Caribbean</ORGANIZATION> islands before turning its 135 mph
winds northward.
   Hurricane forecasters said <PERSON>Gabrielle</PERSON> appeared to be heading
toward the British island of <LOCATION>Bermuda</LOCATION> in the <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION>, but was still
at least three days away and on an uncertain course that seemed to
be moving from a northwesterly course to northward.
   ``The biggest threat now is for <LOCATION>Bermuda</LOCATION> ... Anybody on the <LOCATION>East
Coast</LOCATION> should watch this storm,'' said <PERSON>Bob Sheets</PERSON>, director of the
<ORGANIZATION>National Hurricane Center</ORGANIZATION> in suburban <LOCATION>Coral Gables</LOCATION>.
   Gabrielle, already this season's biggest hurricane, was upgraded
<DATE>Tuesday</DATE> evening to a Category 4 hurricane, with 5 the strongest.
   Forecasters said it rivaled last year's record-setting Hurricane
Gilbert at the same stage, but was on a path more like <DATE>1985</DATE>'s
powerful Hurricane Gloria, which did <MONEY>$900 million</MONEY> in damage as it
raced up the <LOCATION>East Coast</LOCATION> and into <LOCATION>New England</LOCATION>.
   Sheets said <PERSON>Gabrielle</PERSON> was unlikely to come near <LOCATION>South Florida</LOCATION>.
   Gabrielle, with storm winds in a 500-mile-long band, caused storm
swells as far as 1,000 miles from its center, forecasters said.
   Sheets compared <PERSON>Gabrielle</PERSON> to <PERSON>Gilbert</PERSON> of <DATE>1988</DATE>, saying <PERSON>Gabrielle</PERSON>'s
size was similar to <PERSON>Gilbert</PERSON>, which became ``the storm of the
century'' and devastated the island of <LOCATION>Jamaica</LOCATION>. Both were the
seventh named storms of their <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> season, as was <PERSON>Gloria</PERSON>.
   While <PERSON>Gilbert</PERSON> stayed on a westerly course across the upper
<LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> and made landfall in <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Gabrielle</PERSON> was moving out of
the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> and headed up into the <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION>.
   As of <TIME>10:30 p.m. EDT</TIME>, <PERSON>Gabrielle</PERSON> was centered near 22.6 north
latitude and 58.5 west longitude, about 775 miles south-southeast of
<LOCATION>Bermuda</LOCATION>. It was moving northwest at 12 mph.
   The governments of the <LOCATION>Leeward Islands</LOCATION> countries urged small
craft to stay in port and issued heavy surf warnings as <PERSON>Gabrielle</PERSON>
pushed 74 mph (hurricane-force) winds as far as 100 miles away from
its center.
   <PERSON>Henry Laskosky</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>National Weather Service</ORGANIZATION> forecaster in <LOCATION>San
Juan</LOCATION>, predicted rough seas for the island.
   ``It should not bother us at all, except for seas, they'll be a
little rough tonight and <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>,'' <PERSON>Laskosky</PERSON> said.
   In <LOCATION>Barbados</LOCATION>, the easternmost <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> island 550 miles southeast
of <LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Gabrielle</PERSON>'s tail caused 10-foot waves and rough seas
on the island's east coast <DATE>Monday</DATE>. Some beachfront homes and
businesses in the capital of <LOCATION>Bridgetown</LOCATION> were flooded <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
   No injuries or serious damages were reported.
   The weather in <LOCATION>Barbados</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Leeward</LOCATION> islands on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> was sunny
and clear.
   Forecaster <PERSON>John Toohey</PERSON> said the hurricane would have no effect on
the <LOCATION>Virgin Islands</LOCATION>.
   Gloria, the last major hurricane on the <LOCATION>U.S. East Coast</LOCATION> in <DATE>Sept.
16-Oct</DATE>. 1, <DATE>1985</DATE>, started on a track similar to <LOCATION>Gabrielle</LOCATION>. The
hurricane, which moved up the <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> at an unusually fast 30 to 50
mph, panicked thousands of coastal residents but turned out not to
be the massive killer hurricane predicted. It was a Category 3 storm
when it hit the coast, but had earlier had winds of 150 mph.
   ``People were very fortunate with <PERSON>Gloria</PERSON>,'' Hurricane Center
spokesman <PERSON>Martin Nelson</PERSON> said. ``The tides were in our favor and it
stayed offshore. We can take all the chastising about crying wolf,
but we're not going to downplay this one because of <PERSON>Gloria</PERSON>.''
   Meanwhile, far to the north, Hurricane Felix was back to 85 mph
winds after falling to 39 mph over the <DATE>weekend</DATE>.
   Little additional strengthening was expected for Felix, which was
no threat to land. At <TIME>10:30 p.m. EDT</TIME>, its center was located near
36.5 north latitude and 48.5 west longitude, or about 950 miles west
of the westernmost <LOCATION>Azores</LOCATION>, and it was barely moving.

   Gabrielle, dwindled from a hurricane to a tropical
storm, lost more its punch <DATE>Monday</DATE> while forecasters began watching a
new tropical depression shaping up in the area where <PERSON>Gabrielle</PERSON> got
its start.
   Gabrielle, lingering south of <LOCATION>Nova Scotia</LOCATION>, lost its hurricane
status late <DATE>Sunday</DATE> when its maximum sustained wind speed dropped
below the 74 mph minimum. By <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>evening</TIME>, it had slowed to 45 mph.
   The depression, the 11th since the <DATE>1989</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>Atlantic Hurricane</ORGANIZATION> season
began <DATE>June 1</DATE>, formed from a tropical wave off <LOCATION>West Africa</LOCATION>. It had a
maximum sustained wind speed of 45 mph and was expected to reach
tropical-storm strength of 39 mph by noon <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>. It would be named
Hugo.
   ``This is the peak of the tropical storm season and these
tropical waves are moving off the coast of <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> every three or
four days like clockwork,'' said forecaster <PERSON>Max Mayfield</PERSON> of the
<ORGANIZATION>National Hurricane Center</ORGANIZATION> in suburban <LOCATION>Coral Gables</LOCATION>.
   Neither it nor <PERSON>Gabrielle</PERSON> posed any immediate threat to land,
although <PERSON>Gabrielle</PERSON>'s wind still created unusually high surf
conditions along the southern coast of <LOCATION>Nova Scotia</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>U.S. East
Coast</LOCATION> north of <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>.
   During the <DATE>weekend</DATE>, swells, undertow and waves up to 15 feet high
lashed the coast from <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, and three people apparently
drowned and at least six others were missing.
   At <TIME>10:30 p.m. EDT</TIME>, the center of <PERSON>Gabrielle</PERSON> was near latitude 41.0
north, longitude 60.0 west, or about 195 miles south southwest of
<LOCATION>Sable Island</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Nova Scotia</LOCATION>. It was drifting north-northeast at about
12 mph and was expected to continue that course through the day.
   Also at <TIME>10:30 p.m.</TIME>, Hugo's center was near latitude 12.5 north
and longitude 31.5 west, or about 485 miles west southwest of the
southernmost <LOCATION>Cape Verde</LOCATION> islands, where many strong, peak-season
storms like <PERSON>Gabrielle</PERSON> are born. It was moving west at about 20 mph.
   Gabrielle was the seventh named storm of the <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> hurricane
season and the fourth hurricane.

   The ``greenhouse effect'' may breed bigger and
deadlier hurricanes in the future, storms up to <PERCENT>50 percent</PERCENT> stronger
than Hugo and <DATE>last year</DATE>'s record-setting <PERSON>Gilbert</PERSON>, some
meteorologists say.
   Hugo blasted the eastern <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Carolinas</LOCATION> with 135 mph
winds this past week, killing at least 41 people.
   Just before Hugo struck the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> coast, its pressure was measured
at 940 millibars. That made it among the 12 strongest hurricanes
this century to hit the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>National Hurricane
Center</ORGANIZATION>'s Miles <PERSON>Lawrence</PERSON> said <DATE>today</DATE>.
   Gilbert, whose winds reached 180 mph, tore up the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> <DATE>last
year</DATE>, killing 300 and causing <MONEY>$2 billion</MONEY> damage. It was the most
powerful hurricane ever recorded.
   Gilbert seems to be about the upper limit of a hurricane with
current ocean temperatures, said <PERSON>Kerry Emanuel</PERSON> of the meteorology
department at the <ORGANIZATION>Massachusetts Institute of Technology</ORGANIZATION>.
   But if the seas warm up, say by 3 to 6 degrees Fahrenheit, ``the
wind speeds might be <PERCENT>25 percent</PERCENT> higher _ which means the destructive
force would be more like <PERCENT>50 percent</PERCENT> higher,'' he said.
   <PERSON>Stephen Schneider</PERSON>, deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION>National Center for
Atmospheric Research</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION>, said his research suggests the
warming trend is already here.
   Schneider, an expert on the greenhouse effect and author of a new
book ``Global Warming,'' said six of the 10 hottest years in the
last 100 occurred in the <DATE>1980s</DATE>.
   He projects that the <DATE>1990s</DATE> will be even hotter.
   Hugo demonstrated the effect of warm <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> waters when its
winds jumped from 105 mph to 135 mph as it passed over the <ORGANIZATION>Gulf
Stream</ORGANIZATION> before hitting the <LOCATION>East Coast</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Schneider</PERSON> said.
   ``You'll get worse hurricanes if the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> is warmer,'' he
said. ``And I think there are better-than-even odds that you will
have stronger hurricanes.''
   <PERSON>Emanuel</PERSON> said if the ocean temperature climbs, moderate hurricanes
of the future could grow to <PERSON>Gilbert</PERSON>'s strength _ and future Gilberts
will be even stronger.
   Gilbert was so strong that <PERSON>Bob Sheets</PERSON>, director of the national
hurricane center, said forecasters may have to use an intensity
scale of 1-6 in the future, instead of the current 1-5, with five
the highest.
   The computer models <PERSON>Schneider</PERSON> uses show that in a worst-case
scenario, over the next 100 years the world's temperature could jump
by 10 degrees if carbon dioxide and methane gas _ which both
contribute to the greenhouse effect _ continue to pour into the
atmosphere unchecked.
   It is possible that even though the world as a whole heats up,
the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> could somehow remain cooler. But he said that is
unlikley.
   ``That's not what the models are showing,'' <PERSON>Schneider</PERSON> said. ``And
that's another reason I'd like to slow down global warming.''

<TEXT>
   The remnants of Hurricane Hugo made a surprise sweep through <LOCATION>West
Virginia</LOCATION> on <DATE>Friday</DATE>, downing power and telephone lines, snapping
trees and causing flooding before fizzling and meandering toward
<LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>.
   ``There's basically nothing left of him,'' said weather service
meteorologist <PERSON>Alan Reznek</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Charleston</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>W.Va.</LOCATION> ``His punch is gone.''
   The center of the storm advanced farther westward than expected,
targeting eastern <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, western <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> and western <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>
before it was expected to wear itself out in <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>. It was moving
to the north at 30 mph.
   <LOCATION>Charleston</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>S.C.</LOCATION>, got the full brunt of Hugo, which wrecked a
string of <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> resort islands beginning early <DATE>Sunday</DATE>. There
were 20 confirmed deaths in the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION>, but an official on <LOCATION>Puerto
Rico</LOCATION> said the death toll for the region was 26 people. About 50,000
people are homeless.
   Ten of the 11 <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> deaths were in <LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION>. Eight died in
counties surrounding <LOCATION>Charleston</LOCATION> and one in the <LOCATION>Columbia</LOCATION> area, said
<PERSON>Warren Hardy</PERSON> of the state's <ORGANIZATION>Office of Emergency Preparedness</ORGANIZATION>. In
<LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION>, a 6-month-old baby was killed in <LOCATION>Union County</LOCATION> when a
tree fell on a house.
   A hurricane is a heat engine fueled by warm, moist air over open
oceans. When these giant storms hit land, they lose their wallop,
although they can still manage considerable bluster.
   Hugo was downgraded into a tropical storm at <TIME>6 a.m.</TIME> and decayed
more as it went inland, but places in its path could expect several
inches of rain and high winds. By <TIME>6 p.m.</TIME>, <PERSON>Hugo</PERSON> had lost the
characteristics of a tropical storm, although the weather system
featured maximum sustained winds of 40 mph and torrential rains.
   Its last location was just west of <LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pa.</LOCATION>, at latitude
40.5 degrees north and longitude 81 degrees west. Officials said no
further tracking would be done.
   Earlier, Hugo was expected to skirt <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION>. But
communities in the southern part of the state instead were lashed by
fierce winds and inundated with water.
   ``It's blowing 45 or 50 miles an hour,'' said <PERSON>Fred Kitts</PERSON>, of the
<ORGANIZATION>Mercer County Sheriff's Department</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Princeton</LOCATION>. ``We've had trees
fall on houses, cars, trailers. There are power lines everywhere.''
   Heavy rains brought rapidly rising water, which forced some
evacuations <DATE>Friday</DATE> in the Oakvale area of <LOCATION>Mercer County</LOCATION>, said
officials with the county's emergency services. There were no
immediate reports of injuries.
   At <TIME>4 p.m. EDT</TIME>, the weather service said the center of the rapidly
weakening storm had moved out of <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION> into southeastern
<LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>. Bob Sheets, director of the <ORGANIZATION>National Hurricane Center</ORGANIZATION>, said
the storm was expected to pass through eastern <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> and western
<LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> late <DATE>Friday</DATE> or early <DATE>Saturday</DATE>.
   The weather service issued a small stream and urban flood warning
<DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>evening</TIME> for <LOCATION>Cuyahoga</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Medina</PERSON> counties in <LOCATION>northeast Ohio</LOCATION>.
About 2{ inches of rain fell in <LOCATION>Medina</LOCATION> during a 90-minute period
late <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME>.
   An outer band of the tropical storm hit <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION>'s western half
earlier <DATE>Friday</DATE>, knocking down power lines and trees with winds
gusting as high as 81 mph and forcing residents in low-lying areas
of several counties to evacuate.
   But the eye of the storm swept through the narrowest part of the
state _ entering in <LOCATION>Washington County</LOCATION> and exiting in <LOCATION>Tazwell County</LOCATION>
_ and dumped far less rain than anticipated. Five to 10 inches of
rain was expected in areas where 3 inches or less fell.
   ``It passed a lot farther west than we thought it would and it
didn't stay here too long,'' said <PERSON>Janet Clements</PERSON>, spokeswoman for
the state <ORGANIZATION>Department of Emergency Services</ORGANIZATION>. No serious injuries were
reported.
   In <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, government agencies, schools, transit officials
and property owners, preparing for the worst, were relieved when the
brunt of the storm missed the nation's capital.
   In <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION>, rain and blustery winds were the biggest
concern. The threat of high tides and flooding and closed down the
<ORGANIZATION>Statue of Liberty</ORGANIZATION>'s island.
   Emergency management coordinators in <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> also expected the
the worst from Hugo, but instead saw only some rainstorms and gusty
winds.

   Officials warned residents of the
<LOCATION>U.S. Virgin Islands</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION> and nearby islands to bolt down
everything loose and stock up on food and water <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> as
Hurricane Dean rumbled through the eastern <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION>.
   Dean was upgraded from a tropical storm to the second hurricane
of the <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> season <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, and by nightfall the <ORGANIZATION>National
Weather Center</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION> reported the hurricane's winds had
strengthened to 80 mph.
   Hurricane warnings were posted for the <ORGANIZATION>Leeward Islands</ORGANIZATION> from
<LOCATION>Antigua</LOCATION> to the <LOCATION>U.S. Virgin Islands</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION>, said
forecasters at the <ORGANIZATION>National Hurricane Center</ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>.
   At <TIME>midnight EDT</TIME>, forecasters reported the center of the
hurricane was at latitude 18.5 north and longitude 61.3 west,
moving westerly at 15 mph. Its latest position was 310 miles east
of <LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION>, 65 miles northeast of <LOCATION>Barbuda</LOCATION> and about 240 miles
east of <LOCATION>St. Thomas</LOCATION>.
   The storm was moving over warm tropical waters at 15 mph, down
slightly from the 20 mph it had sustained much of the day. But
forecasters said some strengthening was possible in the next 24
hours.
   An advisory issued by the <ORGANIZATION>National Weather Service</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>San Juan</LOCATION>
for the <LOCATION>U.S. Virgin Islands</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION> advised residents to
``secure loose objects or move them indoors,'' board or tape
windows and stock up on emergency supplies such as drinking water,
food that needs no refrigeration and batteries.
   ``This is a dangerous storm and should not be taken lightly,
even though it is a minimal hurricane,'' it said. ``Don't take
chances. It could lead to injuries or even death.''
   In <LOCATION>San Juan</LOCATION>, a city of 1.1 million people, shoppers formed long
lines in supermarkets, workers boarded up windows of the governor's
mansion and stores in the tourist district of <LOCATION>Old San Juan</LOCATION>.
   A hurricane advisory said aircraft reports indicated Dean's
center was moving westward after making a temporary jog northwest.
``This increases the threat to the northern Leeward islands,'' it
said.
   Forecasters said the storm was expected to first hit land in
<LOCATION>Barbuda</LOCATION>, the easternmost <LOCATION>Leeward Island</LOCATION> and move northwest toward
the <LOCATION>U.S. Virgin Islands</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION> over the <DATE>next 24</DATE> to 36
hours.
   Government radio in the twin island state of <LOCATION>Antigua</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Barbuda</LOCATION>
said Dean was expected to hit <LOCATION>Barbuda</LOCATION> on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>, and
warned residents to bar windows, latch down loose objects and stock
up on water.
   <LOCATION>Barbuda</LOCATION> is a flat, 62-square-mile coral island with a population
of 1,200 and little industry or tourism.
   A hurricane warning for <LOCATION>Guadeloupe</LOCATION> was dropped, as was a
hurricane watch for <LOCATION>Dominica</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Martinique</LOCATION>.
   In <LOCATION>Coral Gables</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla.</LOCATION>, hurricane specialist <PERSON>Jim Gross</PERSON> called
Dean a small hurricane, with hurricane-force winds confined to
within 25 miles of its center.
   Rainfall of 4 to 8 inches and tides 2 to 4 feet above normal
were said to be possible in the storm's path.
   Authorities broadcast similar warnings in several nearby islands.
   Dean grew from the fifth tropical depression of the season
<DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME> into a named storm by <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>.
   Three other storms have formed since the season began <DATE>June 1</DATE>.
   Tropical Storm <PERSON>Allison</PERSON>, caused widespread flooding in <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION> in <DATE>June</DATE>. Barry churned up the open <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> last month
before dissipating.
   Chantal became a hurricane <DATE>Monday</DATE> and was downgraded to a
tropical depression <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> night after hitting land in <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>.

   Residents from <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION> stocked up
on groceries, flashlights and window-reinforcing tape for Hurricane
Hugo's expected assault and the <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> sent ships to sea today to ride
out the killer storm.
   Looting broke out on <ORGANIZATION>St. Croix</ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION>U.S. Virgin Islands</LOCATION> in the
wake of the storm blamed for at least 25 deaths in the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION>.
President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> declared the islands a disaster area, and the
government made available <MONEY>$500,000</MONEY> for food and emergency supplies
there.
   Forecasters said the chances of the hurricane hitting the <LOCATION>East
Coast</LOCATION> late this week were steadily increasing, and most projected
paths had the storm hitting between <LOCATION>Cape Canaveral</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Cape
Hatteras</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.C.</LOCATION>, by early <DATE>Saturday</DATE>.
   The storm today brushed northeast of the <LOCATION>Bahamas</LOCATION> with winds of
105 mph and was expected to bring mostly high wind and rain. Workers
boarded up government buildings, and Prime Minister <PERSON>Lynden Pindling</PERSON>
cut short a visit to <LOCATION>Jamaica</LOCATION>.
   ``Although the indications are that it's going to move east of
the more populated areas, no one is relaxing their vigil because it
can change direction,'' said <PERSON>Bill Kalis</PERSON>, a spokesman for the
Bahamian government.
   At noon <ORGANIZATION>EDT</ORGANIZATION>, Hugo's center was 360 miles east of <LOCATION>Nassau</LOCATION> in the
<LOCATION>Bahamas</LOCATION>. Its coordinates were 25.8 north latitude and 71.5 west
longitude and it was moving northwest at 12 mph, a course it was
expected to maintain through today.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> today began to send ships to sea from a base at
<LOCATION>Charleston</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>S.C.</LOCATION>, to avoid storm damage.
   Looters ransacked stores and law enforcement collapsed on <LOCATION>St.
Croix</LOCATION>, where tourists pleaded with reporters for help in getting out.
   ``When we landed, we were pounced upon by about 15 tourists,''
said <PERSON>Gary Williams</PERSON>, a reporter for a San Juan newspaper. ``They
said, `Please get food! Please get water! Please help us! They're
looting. We've seen police looting. We've seen <ORGANIZATION>National Guard</ORGANIZATION>
looting. There's no law and order here.'''
   Hugo so far has left <MONEY>millions of dollars</MONEY> in damage, more than
50,000 Caribbean residents homeless and hundreds of injuries. It
ripped away roofs, flattened houses, flipped planes, damaged cash
crops and knocked out power and communications.
   The death toll was incomplete, and officials feared it would grow
as rescuers searched collapsed buildings.
   On <DATE>Monday</DATE>, the hurricane's 125 mph winds smashed directly into
<LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION>, where officials said 10,000 people were homeless and
25,000 were in shelters.
   Two <ORGANIZATION>Coast Guard</ORGANIZATION> planes carrying fresh water, food and lumber
arrived in <LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION> late <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, and several other relief
flights were planned today. President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> was expected to declare
the island a disaster area.
   The hardest-hit islands were still cut off from normal
communication early today. On the tiny British island of <LOCATION>Montserrat</LOCATION>,
officials said nearly every building was destroyed, including the
only hospital on the island of 12,000.
   ``It's as if a bomb has been dropped in the buildings and
everything has been blown out. All trees are like stubble. There's
not a flower left standing,'' said Cmdr. <PERSON>Colin Ferbrache</PERSON> of the
<ORGANIZATION>Royal Navy</ORGANIZATION> vessel H.M.S. Alacrity, which was stationed off
<LOCATION>Montserrat</LOCATION>.
   National Hurricane Center specialist <PERSON>Bob Case</PERSON> said the <LOCATION>East Coast</LOCATION>
would feel the storm's fringe effects of rain and some gusty winds
at least through <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>, if Hugo stayed on its track
parallel to the <LOCATION>Bahamas</LOCATION>.
   In <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION>, residents stocked up on batteries, food, plywood and
generators. Insurance companies told agents to hold up writing some
types of policies until the storm passed. Boaters were advised to
move inland.
   <ORGANIZATION>Sheriff Van Findley</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Effingham County</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ga.</LOCATION>, said he was
rounding up generators for emergency medical headquarters and
shelters and arranging for chainsaws for use in cutting trees that
may block evacuation routes.
   ``I see a lot of people buying water and canned goods like pork
and beans,'' <PERSON>Bryan Raleigh</PERSON>, manager of a grocery in the <LOCATION>Wilmington</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>N.C.</LOCATION>, area. ``It's been pretty steady all morning.''
   Off <LOCATION>Charleston</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>S.C.</LOCATION>, a ship salvaging <MONEY>$400 million</MONEY> in gold from
a sunken 19th-century steamship sought safe harbor. In <LOCATION>Myrtle Beach</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>S.C.</LOCATION>, officials began moving bulldozers to where they would be
readily accessible if the storm hit.
   A <LOCATION>Mount Pleasant</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>S.C.</LOCATION>, hardware store manager said residents
grabbed batteries, masking tape, flashlights and lamp oil. ``I think
people are taking it seriously,'' said <PERSON>Louis Middleton</PERSON>. ``There are
some old-timers who have memories of Hazel and <LOCATION>Gracie</LOCATION>,'' hurricanes
that hit <LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION> in the <DATE>1950s</DATE>.
   Others took a wait-and-see attitude.
   ``We have quite a few tourists still, but everybody seems pretty
calm,'' said <PERSON>Mabel Gaskins</PERSON> of coastal <LOCATION>Ocracoke</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.C.</LOCATION> ``Most of them
are waiting for <DATE>Thursday</DATE> or <DATE>Friday</DATE> to see what it does.''
   Workers at <ORGANIZATION>Kennedy Space Center</ORGANIZATION> were ready to move space shuttle
Atlantis, scheduled for launch <DATE>Oct. 12</DATE>, from the launch pad to a
hangar if necessary. They also were prepared to remove a <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION>
communications satellite from an Atlas-Centaur rocket on another
pad. Decisions on both missions might not come until <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>
said.
   Meanwhile, forecasters said <ORGANIZATION>Tropical Storm Iris</ORGANIZATION> is weakening
because of its closeness to Hugo. At noon, <PERSON>Iris</PERSON> was near latitude
21.5 north and longitude 62.8 west, or 230 miles north of the
<LOCATION>Leeward Islands</LOCATION> and moving northwest at about 12 mph.

   People caught by Hurricane Hugo last
year might disagree, but forecasters here say the deadly storm may
have had a positive side effect _ it got the public's attention.
   And one forecaster says hurricane seasons may be getting worse.
   Hugo, which caused an unprecedented <MONEY>$10 billion</MONEY> in damage,
killed 28 people in the Lesser Antilles islands and an additional
29 in <LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION>.
   But it would have been much more deadly if it had hit almost
anywhere else, says <PERSON>Bob Sheets</PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION>National Hurricane
Center</ORGANIZATION>.
   At the advent of the <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> hurricane season, which runs from
<DATE>June 1</DATE> to <DATE>Nov. 30</DATE>, Sheets and other hurricane experts are using
Hugo's example to get the attention of complacent coastal residents
who've never experienced such fury.
   ``We'll take advantage of the fact that there was a Hugo last
year and raise people's awareness,'' said Sheets. ``The
consequences of not being prepared are too great.''
   Early warnings about Hugo <DATE>last September</DATE> allowed 350,000 people
to evacuate safely, and in <LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION> the worst of the
hurricane struck the <ORGANIZATION>Francis Marion National Forest</ORGANIZATION> between
<LOCATION>Charleston</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Myrtle Beach</LOCATION>, Sheets said.
   It heavily damaged the fishing village of <LOCATION>McClellanville</LOCATION> and
several small rural communities, but the population there is sparse.
   If Hugo had struck a major coastal population center, the
destruction would have been greater than most Americans have ever
seen, according to computer simulations known as SLOSH models, for
Sea, <ORGANIZATION>Lake</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Overland Surges</LOCATION> from Hurricanes.
   With SLOSH, forecasters can predict the height of the storm
surge _ the mass of water piled up by the storm that is a
hurricane's most destructive component _ anywhere along the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
coast by punching in a storm's speed, size and intensity, Sheets
said.
   ``The population density in <LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION> is a lot different
from the <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> coast, <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> or <LOCATION>Galveston</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>,'' Sheets
said. ``Compare that situation to the <LOCATION>Miami-through-Palm Beach</LOCATION> area
_ all of <ORGANIZATION>Dade</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Broward</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Palm Beach</LOCATION> counties would have been ...
destroyed.''
   Hugo was the worst hurricane to strike the southeastern <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
coast since <PERSON>Betsy</PERSON> hit the <LOCATION>Florida Keys</LOCATION> in <DATE>1965</DATE>, killing 74 before
it went on to <LOCATION>Missisippi</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION>. Since then, the population
of areas such as south <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> has ballooned and most residents
have never directly experienced a hurricane.
   According to one of the nation's leading hurricane experts, Hugo
may have been the first in a new era of killer storms.
   ``No one knows for sure, but the odds are, <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>East
Coast</LOCATION> are going to get it,'' <PERSON>William Gray</PERSON>, professor of atmospheric
science at <ORGANIZATION>Colorado State University</ORGANIZATION>, told a national conference of
weather experts this month.
   Gray came to this conclusion after his usually accurate
predictions for hurricane activity were off the mark last year. He
had figured the <DATE>1989</DATE> season would be relatively mild, with only
four hurricanes; instead, seven hurricanes and four tropical storms
killed a total of 84 people.
   ``He blew it pretty bad,'' Sheets said. ``But then he looked at
the rainfall over <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>, and found an amazing correlation between
rainfall there and hurricane activity over <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>.''
   Gray realized the 30-year drought in <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>'s Sahel region
corresponds almost exactly to the years when no major hurricanes
have struck the southeastern coast.
   ``Whether one causes the other is uncertain. They both may
reflect larger-scale events. But the <PERSON>Sahel</PERSON> is now getting up to
near-normal rainfall,'' Sheets said.
   Gray plans to release his predictions for <DATE>1990</DATE> on <DATE>June 5</DATE>.
   Tropical storms have been recorded in the <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> in every
month except <DATE>April</DATE>, but are rare outside the <DATE>June 1</DATE> to <DATE>Nov. 30</DATE>
season. Last week, a preseason tropical depression brought heavy
rain to <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION>.
   A tropical depression becomes a tropical storm and is given a
name if its sustained winds reach 39 mph; it becomes a hurricane if
winds reach 74 mph.
   The names for <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> hurricanes and tropical storms this year
are: <PERSON>Arthur</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Bertha</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Cesar</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Diana</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Edouard</ORGANIZATION>, Fran, <PERSON>Gustav</PERSON>, <PERSON>Hortense</PERSON>,

   Hurricane <PERSON>Jerry</PERSON> blustered ashore with 80
mph winds, flinging a half-dozen twisters inland, blacking out
thousands of homes and killing two people before quickly losing
much of its punch today.
   A voluntary evacuation order for thousands of people in the
low-lying southwestern corner of <LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION> was lifted today as the
remnants of the late-season storm moved away to the north through
eastern <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>.
   By <TIME>5 a.m.</TIME> the storm was downgraded to a tropical depression with
winds at 35 mph. It was centered was 35 miles east-southeast of
<LOCATION>Lufkin</LOCATION>, near 31.2 degrees north latitude and 94.2 degrees west
longitude. It was moving northeast at 17 mph and was expected to
continue in that direction and weaken further.
   As the hurricane blew into <LOCATION>Galveston</LOCATION> from the <LOCATION>Gulf of Mexico</LOCATION>, it
uprooted trees, smashed windows and tore several balconies from an
apartment building. ``Whole balconies came down. It just ripped
them up from the bolts,'' said resident <PERSON>John Harsh</PERSON>.
   But damage overall was limited, with City Manager <PERSON>Doug Matthews</PERSON>
saying today that it is estimated to be less than <MONEY>$10 million</MONEY>. He
said also that there was no looting.
   The bodies of a 24-year-old man, who worked for the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Coast
Guard</ORGANIZATION>, and his 2-year-old daughter were found on rock jetties on
<LOCATION>Galveston Island</LOCATION>'s protective seawall, <LOCATION>Galveston</LOCATION> police said. It
appeared that they had been in a car that was swept off the
seawall, officers said.
   The seawall was erected after <LOCATION>Galveston</LOCATION> was devastated in a <DATE>1900</DATE>
hurricane in which 6,000 or more people died. It was the deadliest
hurricane on record in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>.
   A tornado spun off by <PERSON>Jerry</PERSON> damaged several buildings in the
town of Orange near the <LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION> line, and another twister ripped
the door off a <LOCATION>Galveston</LOCATION> fire truck and damaged the fire station
and a shed at the airport.
   Tornadoes or funnel clouds were sighted around <LOCATION>Galveston Bay</LOCATION> in
<LOCATION>Hitchcock</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Baytown</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Beach City</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Webster</PERSON> and a nearby spot northeast
of <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> Highway 6. Tornado damage generally was confined to roofs
and power lines.
   Two tornadoes were spotted early today in inland <LOCATION>Polk County</LOCATION>,
damaging some houses and barns, said sheriff's spokeswoman <PERSON>Genace
Chapman</PERSON>.
   At least 52,000 homes and businesses lost power, most of them in
<LOCATION>Galveston Island</LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION>Houston Lighting &amp; Power</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON>Graham
Painter</PERSON>. But by <TIME>5 a.m.</TIME> <DATE>today</DATE>, <PERCENT>80 percent</PERCENT> of the power was restored.
Phone service to much of the island also was disrupted.
   The center of the hurricane made landfall <DATE>Sunday</DATE> <TIME>evening</TIME>, with
sustained winds of 80 mph and 100 mph gusts, according to the
<ORGANIZATION>National Hurricane Center</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Coral Gables</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla</LOCATION>. Within 3{ hours,
<PERSON>Jerry</PERSON> was downgraded to a tropical storm after its maximum
sustained winds fell below 74 mph.
   On <LOCATION>Galveston</LOCATION>, which bore the brunt of the storm, an early
assessment found minor street flooding but little serious damage,
said <PERSON>Gary Vasquez</PERSON> of the emergency operations center. The biggest
task appeared to be cleaning up debris scattered by the wind, he
said.
   ``I think we did very well,'' said Mayor <PERSON>Jan Coggeshall</PERSON>.
   Schools were open as usual today, except for one elementary
school closed because of a power outage.
   Jerry was considered a category 1 hurricane, the least severe
possible. Hurricane Hugo, which devastated parts of the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION>
and <LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION> <DATE>last month</DATE>, was a category 4 with winds of 135
mph. Jerry was much smaller, too, with hurricane-force winds
extending just 15 to 25 miles out from the eye, as compared with
100 miles for Hugo.
   But <PERSON>Jerry</PERSON> was still enough to cause fear in low-lying areas,
particularly because it coincided with an unusually high tide
caused by a rare alignment of the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, moon and sun. The
combination of astronomical forces and the storm sent tides 5 to 8
feet above normal.
   In <LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Cameron Parish</PERSON>, officials <DATE>Sunday</DATE> urged voluntary
evacuation of 8,000 to 10,000 residents. ``We're just concerned
about getting people to higher ground,'' said <PERSON>Scott Henry</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Civil
Defense</ORGANIZATION> volunteer.
   The evacuation advisory was lifted <TIME>this morning</TIME>.
   Earlier, hundreds of workers had been evacuated from offshore
oil rigs as <PERSON>Jerry</PERSON> zigzagged through the gulf during the weekend.
   Most of <LOCATION>Galveston</LOCATION>'s 62,000 residents decided to stay in their
homes instead of evacuating for <PERSON>Jerry</PERSON>.
   By <TIME>11 p.m.</TIME>, those who had moved to shelters were told they could
return home, said <PERSON>Gary Stone</PERSON>, spokesman for <LOCATION>Galveston</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Emergency
Operations Center</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>Jerry</PERSON> was the seventh hurricane of the six-month <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION>
season, which ends in <DATE>November</DATE>. Hugo was easily the most
destructive, killing 33 people in the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> and 29 on the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
mainland and causing <MONEY>billions of dollars</MONEY> in damage.

   Tropical storm <PERSON>Arthur</PERSON>, with heavy rains and wind up
to 70 mph, strengthened <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> and forecasters warned that it
could turn into a hurricane threatening parts of <LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION> and
the <LOCATION>Dominican Republic</LOCATION>.
   The Dominican Republic issued a tropical storm watch for the
south coast of the island after <PERSON>Arthur</PERSON> pushed across the <LOCATION>Windward
Islands</LOCATION> and into the <LOCATION>Caribbean Sea</LOCATION>. A similar watch was in effect
for the south coast of <LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION>.
   Forecasters said a hurricane watch could be issued for parts of
those areas late <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
   Arthur was expected to ``remain very near to hurricane
intensity'' through early <DATE>Thursday</DATE> without reaching sustained winds
of 74 mph that would classify it as a hurricane, said <PERSON>Mark Zimmer</PERSON>,
hurricane specialist at the <ORGANIZATION>National Hurricane Center</ORGANIZATION> in suburban
<LOCATION>Coral Gables</LOCATION>.
   ``We think that there is more than a <PERCENT>50-50 percent</PERCENT> chance that
it won't become a hurricane,'' he said. ``But there is certainly
the chance that in the <DATE>next 12</DATE> to 18 hours it could go ahead and
reach hurricane intensity.''
   At <TIME>10 p.m. EDT</TIME>, <PERSON>Arthur</PERSON> was centered near latitude 14.2 north and
longitude 65.5 west, or about 420 miles southeast of <ORGANIZATION>Santo Domingo</ORGANIZATION>,
<LOCATION>Dominican Republic</LOCATION>. It was moving northwest at about 15 mph and was
expected to continue that motion through the next day or two, said
<PERSON>Bob Sheets</PERSON>, director of the hurricane center.
   Arthur, the <DATE>1990</DATE> Atlantic hurricane season's first named storm,
grew from a tropical depression, the second of the <DATE>1990</DATE> season,
that formed <DATE>Sunday</DATE> in the open <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION>. The hurricane season runs
from <DATE>June 1</DATE> to <DATE>Nov. 30</DATE>.

   Hurricane Hugo's leading edge brought
rain to the lower <LOCATION>East Coast</LOCATION> <DATE>today</DATE>, and thousands fled inland. The
first of 1,000 soldiers sent by President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> arrived in the <LOCATION>Virgin
Islands</LOCATION> to quell looting in the storm's wake.
   With landfall expected as early as tonight between <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION> and the killer storm's winds rising to 110 mph,
schools were closed, homes were boarded up, residents stocked up on
emergency supplies and shelters opened.
   Forecasters warned that waves could tower as much as 16 feet
above normal because the hurricane could cross the coast at high
tide, about <TIME>2:30 a.m.</TIME> Rain of 5 to 10 inches was forecast.
   The military brought aircraft inland and sent ships out to sea to
ride out the storm, which has killed at least 25 people in the
<LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> with direct blows to <LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Virgin Islands</LOCATION>.
   <LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION>'s governor declared an emergency and called out
the <ORGANIZATION>National Guard</ORGANIZATION> to help thousands move inland. As many as 490,000
people were being evacuated from the coast in <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION>, where an
emergency also was declared.
   ``We get a lot of storms over here. I don't get real upset over
them because I've sat through too many of them,'' said <PERSON>Nancy
Treadaway</PERSON>, who was packing this morning to leave <LOCATION>Charleston</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Robin Bevill</PERSON>, taping the windows of her <LOCATION>Wrightsville Beach</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.C.</LOCATION>,
gas station, said residents of the island town were nervous.
   ``Diana, back in <DATE>1984</DATE>, was nothing really to worry about,'' said
<PERSON>Ms. Bevill</PERSON>. ``This one's expected to be bigger. ... It's still
exciting, as long as you're safe.''
   <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> military police were sent to the <LOCATION>Virgin Islands</LOCATION> to reinforce
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> marshals, <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> agents and armed <ORGANIZATION>Coast Guardsmen</ORGANIZATION> who were
dispatched after police reportedly joined prison escapees and
machete-armed mobs in looting on <LOCATION>St. Croix</LOCATION>.
   The first contingent, about 75 soldiers led by a brigadier
general, arrived <TIME>this morning</TIME>, secured the airport and set up a
command center. It appeared to be the first time in more than 20
years that a president ordered active duty military personnel into
the nation's streets.
   ``Everyone in the federal pen there is loose,'' said <PERSON>Eileen Long</PERSON>,
a <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION> advertising executive who was among 145 <ORGANIZATION>St. Croix</ORGANIZATION>
tourists who arrived in <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> <DATE>late Wednesday</DATE> on a
government-arranged evacuation flight.
   ``There are murderers and snipers running around everywhere,''
she said.
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> also declared the <LOCATION>Virgin Islands</LOCATION> a disaster area and freed
up <MONEY>$500,000</MONEY> for relief.
   Hugo sideswiped the <LOCATION>Bahamas</LOCATION> and accelerated as it moved over open
water <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>. ``An increase in forward speed increases the
likelihood that it will strike the coast and not recurve, heading
out to sea,'' said <PERSON>Bob Sheets</PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION>National Hurricane
Center</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>.
   Early today, rain from Hugo fell from <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION> to
<LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla</LOCATION>. Rain was heavy around <LOCATION>Augusta</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ga</LOCATION>. A hurricane
warning was issued from <LOCATION>Fernandina Beach</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla.</LOCATION>, to <LOCATION>Cape Lookout</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.C.</LOCATION>
   Forecasters said there was a 1 in 4 chance that it would come
ashore between <LOCATION>Savannah</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ga.</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Charleston</LOCATION>.
   Charleston officials braced for widespread flooding, noting that
some streets flood at high tide during a full moon even without a
storm. Hospitals stockpiled supplies, discharged patients well
enough to go home and moved others inland. Utility companies said
they would cut off power to <LOCATION>Hilton Head Island</LOCATION>.
   At <LOCATION>Cape Canaveral</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla.</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> decided it was safe to keep shuttle
Atlantis on the launch pad for an <DATE>October</DATE> launch.
   At noon <ORGANIZATION>EDT</ORGANIZATION>, Hugo's center was 305 miles southeast of <LOCATION>Savannah</LOCATION>,
or 29.5 degrees north latitude and 77 degrees west longitude. It was
moving northwest at 17 mph, up from 12 mph <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Bill Clack</PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION>Georgia Emergency
Management Agency</ORGANIZATION>, said he expected 490,000 people would be
evacuated from the state's barrier islands and other low-lying areas.
   From <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> to the <LOCATION>Carolinas</LOCATION>, people stocked up on supplies to
board up windows and carry them through several days without
electricity and water.
   ``They're buying me out of all my candles, tape, flashlights,
propane fuel, oil and lamps,'' said <PERSON>Tim Brindley</PERSON>, manager of a K
mart in <LOCATION>Mount Pleasant</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>S.C.</LOCATION>
   The governor requested shelters opened in eight coastal counties.
His emergency declaration put the <ORGANIZATION>National Guard</ORGANIZATION> and state law
enforcement agencies on alert and ordered vans to be made available
to evacuate the elderly.
   In <LOCATION>Charleston</LOCATION>, the 188-year-old <ORGANIZATION>City Hall</ORGANIZATION> was boarded up, schools
and colleges canceled class and the mayor said the storm could be
the city's biggest catastrophe since a <DATE>1938</DATE> tornado that killed 32
people and injured hundreds.
   ``It's very important no one underestimate the danger of this
hurricane,'' Mayor <PERSON>Joseph P. Riley Jr.</PERSON> said.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> sent its ships from <LOCATION>Charleston</LOCATION> to ride out the storm.
<ORGANIZATION>Hunter Army Air Field</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Savannah</LOCATION> flew more than 60 helicopters
inland. Bases in <LOCATION>Myrtle Beach</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Charleston</LOCATION> also planned to fly
aircraft away from the storm.
   Tropical Storm Iris was close behind. At <TIME>6 a.m. EDT</TIME>, it was near
22.7 north latitude and 66.2 west longitude, or 330 miles east of
<LOCATION>Grand Turk Island</LOCATION>. Winds were 45 mph as the storm moved
west-northwest at about 13 mph.
   The last major storm to blow ashore in <LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION> was <LOCATION>Gracie</LOCATION>
in <DATE>1959</DATE>, which struck near <LOCATION>Beaufort</LOCATION> with winds of more than 100 mph,
leaving 22 dead and <MONEY>$14 million</MONEY> in damage.

<LEADPARA>  HURRICANES ARE part of the romance of the tropics. The great storms have made
fictional plots of B movies and unmade real dreams of people who would implant
civilization in an environment that could be swallowed up by nature in a
moment.;    A hurricane ended the dream of a railroad down the Florida Keys in
1935 and virtually isolated Key West for two years. Nine years earlier, a "Big
One" had stopped Miami's first real-estate boom in its tracks, pushing
floodwaters inland to the new jai alai fronton near where Miami International
Airport sits today.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Front  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  FLORIDA WAITING FOR A 'BIG ONE' TO COME FROM
SEA  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Newspaper headlines have documented <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>'s subsequent hurricanes. The city
was "Lashed" in <DATE>'47</DATE>, "Slammed" in '49 and "Pounded" in <DATE>'50</DATE>. The last to hit
<LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> was <PERSON>Cleo</PERSON>, a small one, in <DATE>1964</DATE>, and the intervening period of calm
defies all odds.;    Many folks here worry about the "Big One" just as
Californians worry about the Big Quake. What would one of those legendary
storms of the past with 200 mph winds pushing huge tidal surges do to this
low-lying metropolis on the <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION>? No one is sure.;    Hurricane season
officially extends from <DATE>June 1</DATE> through <DATE>Nov. 30</DATE>, and scientists at the <ORGANIZATION>National
Hurricane Center</ORGANIZATION>, tucked away on the sixth floor of a nondescript office
building in this <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> suburb, are perking up after another winter lull.;   
From now until the end of the season, the six hurricane specialists will
monitor weather computers 24 hours a day. In this part of the world,
technology has made obsolete such disasters as the unnamed hurricane that
surprised <LOCATION>Galveston</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, in <DATE>1900</DATE>, killing 6,000 people.;    The hurricane
specialists use the nation's only working geostationary weather satellite to
follow developing storms. When a disturbance becomes threatening, a specially
equipped plane is sent into the storm's heart to measure barometric pressure,
wind speed and temperature.;    One of the specialists, <PERSON>Lixion Avila</PERSON>, has
begun counting tropical waves that form off the coast of <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> every few days
during hurricane season. About 60 of these waves of air, not water, form every
year. About 20 of them intensify into stronger disturbances, ranging from
tropical depressions, with wind speeds to 38 mph; to tropical storms, with
winds from 39 to 73 mph; to hurricanes, with winds exceeding 74 mph.;    Last
year, 16 tropical depressions developed in the <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION>. Fourteen became
tropical storms, seven of which became hurricanes, fewer than usual.;   
People who venture into such dubious endeavors as long-term hurricane
forecasting said this could be another light year. But, they said, a
relatively quiet year does not guarantee a thing.;    One such year was <DATE>1935</DATE>
-- only six hurricanes formed, but one was the strongest to hit the continent.
More than 800 workers, brought down to build the Overseas Highway through the
<LOCATION>Florida Keys</LOCATION>, were killed when 200 mph winds knocked their evacuation train
off the tracks.;    NO MATTER what long-range forecasters say, scientists at
the Hurricane Center know that the laws of probability are closing in on
<LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>. They are a conservative bunch, not given to Sunday-supplement scare
stories. <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> has grown immensely since the last major storm and is greatly
overdue, they said.;    "Historically, <LOCATION>south Florida</LOCATION> has had more hurricanes
than any other site," said <PERSON>Jerry Jarrell</PERSON>, a hurricane specialist eyeing
<LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>'s 27-year hiatus nervously. "We would expect a major hurricane to hit
within 75 miles of <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> every eight years.";    At the center, scientists
built a computer model to calculate what would happen if the <DATE>1926</DATE> hurricane
were to hit <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> today. That storm was almost exactly the strength of
Hurricane Hugo, which hit in <LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION> with 135 mph winds in <DATE>September
1989</DATE>. The scientists took data from Hugo and applied it to the path taken by
the <DATE>1926</DATE> hurricane into Miami.;    "It would be a totally different story
here," said <PERSON>Max Mayfield</PERSON>, who collected photos from the <DATE>1926</DATE> storm to
illustrate the model. "How many high-rises did they have on those barrier
islands up in <LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION>? None. I think all these folks in their <LOCATION>Miami
Beach</LOCATION> condos are going to be in for a rude awakening.";    A worst-case storm,
with winds topping 150 mph, would put 5 feet of water in <PERSON>Joe</PERSON>'s Stone Crabs
restaurant, a <LOCATION>Miami Beach</LOCATION> landmark, and 9 feet of water on <LOCATION>Biscayne Boulevard</LOCATION>
in downtown <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>. Surging water could reach levels of 13 1/2 feet in
low-lying areas south of Miami.;    DESPITE MODERN technology, the specialists
cannot forecast precisely where a hurricane will hit. Hurricanes change
direction and intensify in a matter of hours and, in 24 hours, the specialists
said, they could miscalculate one's track by 100 miles. This, and the number
of years since the last major storm hit, has spawned a certain complacency
among residents that the specialists find disturbing.;    <PERSON>Mayfield</PERSON> went to
<LOCATION>Miami Beach</LOCATION> recently to discuss his model with officials there, and what he
heard worried him.;    "The fire department did a survey, and <PERCENT>90 percent</PERCENT> of
the people they talked to said they wouldn't evacuate for a hurricane,"
<PERSON>Mayfield</PERSON> said. "That makes my hair stand straight up."  </TEXT>

<TEXT>
   Hurricane Gabrielle on <DATE>Monday</DATE> pushed a huge,
400-mile-wide band of storm-strength wind across the <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> toward
the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION>.
   However, it will be four to five days before forecasters can say
if it will strike the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> mainland, said <PERSON>Bob Sheets</PERSON>, director of
the <ORGANIZATION>National Hurricane Center</ORGANIZATION>. It was on a path that could take it
northwest of the <LOCATION>Virgin Islands</LOCATION>.
   ``The storm is actually a long way away from any potential
impact,'' Sheets said.
   The <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> season's fourth hurricane had maximum sustained wind
of 130 mph, and meteorologists at the hurricane center in suburban
<LOCATION>Coral Gables</LOCATION> said <PERSON>Gabrielle</PERSON> would probably strengthen as it moved
over warm tropical water.
   ``Everything is favorable as far as the hurricane itself is
