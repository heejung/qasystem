   California insurance regulators are expected as early as
today to sharply curtail the operations of one of troubled
First Capital Holdings Corp.'s major life insurance units,
according to people familiar with the company.
   It is believed that the action will likely be followed by
a conservatorship, in which California regulators formally
take control of the company and all its operations.

<TEXT>
   First Capital won't resist <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> Insurance
Commissioner <PERSON>John Garamendi</PERSON>'s plan to issue cease and desist
orders barring the unit, <ORGANIZATION>First Capital Life Insurance Co.</ORGANIZATION>,
from honoring policyholders' redemption requests and from
selling new policies, those familiar with the situation said.
   The expected orders would halt an apparently increasing
demand for policy redemptions that strip the company of its
cash and can compel the sale of assets at fire-sale prices.
The bar on new business is widely seen as a formality, since
few new policies are being sold these days.
   The regulatory orders would be the second major action
taken by <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> regulators in the past month against a
junk bond-laden insurance company. On <DATE>April 11</DATE>, <PERSON>Mr.
Garamendi</PERSON>'s department seized <ORGANIZATION>First Executive Corp.</ORGANIZATION>'s
<ORGANIZATION>Executive Life Insurance Co.</ORGANIZATION> unit, in the largest insurance
failure ever.
   Industry observers noted that cease and desist orders can
be more quickly carried out than a conservatorship. A
conservatorship is expected to follow because it is harder to
restore policyholder rights of redemption without the
complete regulatory control that conservatorship gives
insurance regulators.
   The exact timing of <PERSON>Mr. Garamendi</PERSON>'s expected move couldn't
be determined. One person familiar with discussions among <PERSON>Mr.
Garamendi</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION> and its advisers said his order is
expected today or <DATE>Monday</DATE>. Another such person predicted the
order will come "very soon" but declined to be more specific.
   A spokesman for <ORGANIZATION>First Capital Life</ORGANIZATION> said the company "is
exploring all our options to best protect policyholders'
investments" but wouldn't elaborate. A spokesman for <PERSON>Mr.
Garamendi</PERSON> declined to comment, as did a spokesman for
<ORGANIZATION>American Express Co.</ORGANIZATION>, which owns <PERCENT>28%</PERCENT> of <ORGANIZATION>First Capital
Holdings</ORGANIZATION>.
   <ORGANIZATION>First Capital Life</ORGANIZATION> had invested assets of <MONEY>$4.1 billion</MONEY> at
<DATE>Dec. 31</DATE>. <ORGANIZATION>First Capital Holdings</ORGANIZATION>' other major life insurance
unit, Virginia-based <ORGANIZATION>Fidelity Bankers Life Insurance Co.</ORGANIZATION>, had
invested assets of <MONEY>$4.0 billion</MONEY>. It isn't known whether
<LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> regulators will take any action, although industry
observers say it is likely to follow <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>'s actions
closely.
   The immediate peril to the <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION> units has been
demands by policyholders to redeem their investments. It is
believed that redemption demand -- already strong in the
weeks since Executive Life was taken over by regulators --
soared this week, after it was disclosed that <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>
regulators were negotiating with <ORGANIZATION>American Express</ORGANIZATION> for a
rescue of <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION>.
   <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION>'s spokesman declined to disclose the amount
of redemption requests. However, he said "the numbers have
been increasing and any increase is a matter of concern." He
added that requests have been "manageable."
   Still, <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION>'s woes go deeper than the recent jump
in redemption demand. As with Executive Life, the <ORGANIZATION>First
Capital</ORGANIZATION> units suffered from plunging junk-bond investments.
About <PERCENT>40%</PERCENT> of <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION>'s invested assets are in such
high-yield securities.
   The market value of <ORGANIZATION>First Capital Holdings</ORGANIZATION> bonds at year's
end was <MONEY>$692 million</MONEY> less than the <MONEY>$5.73 billion</MONEY> at which the
securities were carried on the company's books. First
Capital's spokesman said the market value of those bonds has
improved by <MONEY>$187 million</MONEY> since the <DATE>end of the year</DATE>.
   Several officials involved in the <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION> rescue
talks say <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION>'s portfolio isn't as troubled as
First Executive's, largely because <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION> tended to
buy bonds with better claims on issuing companies' assets and
avoided bonds that don't pay cash interest.
   <ORGANIZATION>Salomon Brothers</ORGANIZATION>, which is representing <ORGANIZATION>First Capital
Holdings</ORGANIZATION> and evaluated First Executive's portfolio for
regulators, has said it can sell <MONEY>$1 billion</MONEY> of <ORGANIZATION>First
Capital</ORGANIZATION>'s junk bonds for no net loss or gain, according to
people familiar with the talks. A <ORGANIZATION>Salomon</ORGANIZATION> official declined
to comment.
   The main effort to bolster <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION>'s financial
foundation came with <PERSON>Mr. Garamendi</PERSON>'s request that <ORGANIZATION>American
Express</ORGANIZATION> shore up the company, but those talks haven't
produced any results yet.
   Besides its own <ORGANIZATION>First Capital Holdings</ORGANIZATION> shares, <ORGANIZATION>American
Express</ORGANIZATION> is concerned about the insurer's fate largely because
stockbrokers at its <ORGANIZATION>Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.</ORGANIZATION> securities
unit sold their customers thousands of insurance policies and
annuities issued by <ORGANIZATION>First Capital Life</ORGANIZATION>.
   <ORGANIZATION>First Capital Holdings</ORGANIZATION> has tried to raise cash by selling
a portion of <ORGANIZATION>First Capital Life</ORGANIZATION>'s insurance business that
amounts to about <MONEY>$1.3 billion</MONEY> of assets. Advisers to <ORGANIZATION>First
Capital</ORGANIZATION> have said that some action by regulators might make
it easier to sell part or all of <ORGANIZATION>First Capital Life</ORGANIZATION> by
stopping the recent rush of policyholder withdrawals.

   American Express Co. is talking with the California
insurance commissioner about ways to prop up First Capital
Holdings Corp., a struggling insurance company in which
American Express owns a 28% stake, according to people
familiar with the talks.
   The talks between officials of American Express and John
Garamendi, the California insurance commissioner, have been
going on for about two weeks, and began with a meeting that
included Mr. Garamendi, American Express Chairman James D.
Robinson III and Howard L. Clark Jr., chairman of Shearson
Lehman Brothers Inc., American Express's securities unit. Mr.
Garamendi and Mr. Clark are scheduled to meet again today in
New York, people familiar with the discussion said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   <PERSON>Mr. Garamendi</PERSON>'s interest in having <ORGANIZATION>American Express</ORGANIZATION>
bolster <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION> could indicate that the <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>
insurance company's problems are more serious than <ORGANIZATION>First
Capital</ORGANIZATION> has indicated. In <DATE>March</DATE>, defaults on junk bonds in
its investment portfolio forced <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION> to revise its
<DATE>fourth-quarter</DATE> financial results to a loss of <MONEY>$24.7 million</MONEY>,
or <MONEY>53 cents</MONEY> a share. The company had previously reported net
income of <MONEY>$10.2 million</MONEY>, or <MONEY>22 cents</MONEY> a share, in the period.
<ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION> said it would try to sell some of its insurance
business and its long-time chairman resigned.
   For <PERSON>Mr. Garamendi</PERSON>, the problems of <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION> come on
the heels of his seizure last month of the largest insurance
unit of <ORGANIZATION>Los Angeles-based First Executive Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, which also
was hurt by its big holdings of junk bonds. <PERSON>Mr. Garamendi</PERSON> is
trying to find a rescuer for the <ORGANIZATION>First Executive</ORGANIZATION> unit,
<ORGANIZATION>Executive Life Insurance Co.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, while <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>
regulators are seeking a buyer for another unit, <ORGANIZATION>Executive
Life Insurance Co.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>.
   <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION> has invested a substantial part of its <MONEY>$8
billion</MONEY> of assets into high-risk, high-yield junk bonds. In
the past, <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION> has reported that about <PERCENT>23.5%</PERCENT> of its
assets are in securities rated below investment grade. But
new reporting rules for insurance companies are likely to
increase that amount.
   <ORGANIZATION>American Express</ORGANIZATION> is concerned about the fate of <ORGANIZATION>First
Capital</ORGANIZATION> largely because <ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION> stockbrokers sold their
customers thousands of insurance policies and annuities
issued by <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION>'s main unit, <ORGANIZATION>First Capital Life
Insurance Co</ORGANIZATION>. If <ORGANIZATION>First Capital Life</ORGANIZATION> becomes insolvent,
<ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION> would most likely face some lawsuits and many angry
customers.
   <ORGANIZATION>American Express</ORGANIZATION> has proposed buying from <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION>
the insurance business that involves <ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION> customers, or
taking over the management of that business and guaranteeing
that <ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION> customers won't incur losses on their policies,
people familiar with the talks said. It isn't clear whether
those proposals will satisfy <PERSON>Mr. Garamendi</PERSON>'s concerns.
   Officials at <ORGANIZATION>American Express</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>California Insurance
Department and First Capital</ORGANIZATION> declined to comment. <ORGANIZATION>First
Capital</ORGANIZATION> shares closed at <MONEY>$2.25</MONEY> on <DATE>Friday</DATE>, up <MONEY>25 cents</MONEY>, in <ORGANIZATION>New
York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading.
   For <ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION>, the negotiations with <PERSON>Mr. Garamendi</PERSON>
represent an unwelcome reminder that the process of digesting
problems created in its massive expansion of the <DATE>late 1980s</DATE>
aren't yet over. Many of <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION>'s annuities and
policies were originally sold by stockbrokers at <ORGANIZATION>E.F. Hutton
&amp; Co.</ORGANIZATION>, which <ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION> acquired after the <DATE>1987</DATE> stock market
crash. <ORGANIZATION>First Capital Life</ORGANIZATION> also was once a <ORGANIZATION>Hutton</ORGANIZATION> unit.
   Insurance industry executives say <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION>'s woes
stem from its promise of relatively high interest rates on
annuities and insurance policies and its failure to raise
capital to support its growth.

   LOS ANGELES -- California regulators clamped down on
operations at the largest insurance unit of First Capital
Holdings Corp., amid growing questions about the medium-sized
insurer's sudden plunge and the risk of major losses to
policyholders.
   The effects of the regulatory order rippled widely Friday,
in the latest woes to surface about a junk bond-laden
insurance company. Worries that regulators would dump the
company's junk bonds prompted a slump in the bond market,
which in turn triggered a wave of computer-guided stock sales
orders.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>'s regulatory step, which had been anticipated,
echoed at <ORGANIZATION>American Express Co.</ORGANIZATION>, which said it will take a
<MONEY>$144 million</MONEY> pretax charge in the current quarter,
representing all of a <PERCENT>28%</PERCENT> stake in Los Angeles-based <ORGANIZATION>First
Capital Holdings</ORGANIZATION> held by <ORGANIZATION>American Express</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Shearson Lehman
Brothers Inc.</ORGANIZATION> unit. There were also negative implications for
<ORGANIZATION>Citicorp</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Citibank</ORGANIZATION> unit, the leader of a <MONEY>$275 million</MONEY>
syndicated loan to <ORGANIZATION>First Capital Holdings</ORGANIZATION>.
   Beleagered <ORGANIZATION>First Capital Holdings</ORGANIZATION> stock shed nearly a
third of its value in <DATE>Friday</DATE>'s tumbling stock markets,
falling <MONEY>43.75 cents</MONEY> to close at <MONEY>93.75 cents</MONEY> in composite
trading on the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION>American Express</ORGANIZATION>
stock slid <MONEY>87.5 cents</MONEY> a share, to close at <MONEY>$23.875</MONEY> on the <ORGANIZATION>Big
Board</ORGANIZATION>.
   <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> Insurance Commissioner <PERSON>John Garamendi</PERSON>, in a
cease and desist order, declared <ORGANIZATION>First Capital Life Insurance
Co.</ORGANIZATION>, the unit of <ORGANIZATION>First Capital Holdings</ORGANIZATION>, to be in "hazardous"
financial condition and barred all policy redemptions and
loans. He also barred the company from writing any new
business. <ORGANIZATION>First Capital Life</ORGANIZATION> will continue to pay ordinary
policyholder claims, including death and annuity benefits.
   The order, issued <DATE>Friday</DATE> in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, was agreed to by
the company, which said the halt to redemptions would help
"stablilize" financial conditions at <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>Mr. Garamendi</PERSON> said his action was impelled by an
unexpected explosion in redemption demands from policyholders
after a disclosure of his demands that <ORGANIZATION>American Express</ORGANIZATION> and
<ORGANIZATION>Shearson Lehman</ORGANIZATION> bolster <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION>'s financial base. From
an average of about <MONEY>$10 million</MONEY> a day <DATE>two weeks ago</DATE>,
redemption requests surged to <MONEY>$25 million</MONEY> last <DATE>Monday</DATE>, <MONEY>$30
million</MONEY> on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, <MONEY>$60 million</MONEY> on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, and <MONEY>$100
million</MONEY> on <DATE>Thursday</DATE>. Redemption requests that were in process
won't be paid as long as regulatory curtailments are in
effect.
   <ORGANIZATION>First Capital Life</ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>, is one of two
major units of <ORGANIZATION>First Capital Holdings</ORGANIZATION>. It had assets of <MONEY>$4.46
billion</MONEY> at <DATE>Dec. 31</DATE>, about 190,000 policyholders and 93,000
annuitants in 49 states. The other major unit, <ORGANIZATION>Fidelity
Bankers Life Insurance Co.</ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION>Richmond</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Va.</LOCATION>, had
assets of <MONEY>$4.07 billion</MONEY> at <DATE>Dec. 31</DATE>, with about 120,000
policyholders and 105,000 annuitants. In all, the two
companies have more than <MONEY>$31 billion</MONEY> of insurance liabilities
payable over many decades.
   A spokesman for <ORGANIZATION>Virginia's Bureau of Insurance</ORGANIZATION> said the
state agency is keeping a close watch on <ORGANIZATION>Fidelity Bankers</ORGANIZATION> and
is in contact with <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> regulators. He said the company
currently is "in good standing" with regulators and meets
legal capital requirements.
   <PERSON>Mr. Garamendi</PERSON>, announcing the cease and desist order, said
that <PERSON>Gerry R. Ginsberg</PERSON>, president and chief operating officer
of <ORGANIZATION>First Capital Holdings</ORGANIZATION>, was removed from oversight of the
<ORGANIZATION>First Capital Life</ORGANIZATION> unit and that <ORGANIZATION>First Capital Life</ORGANIZATION>'s
president, <PERSON>Fred Arthur Buck</PERSON>, will report directly to <PERSON>Richard
K. DeScherer</PERSON>, acting chairman of <ORGANIZATION>First Capital Holdings</ORGANIZATION>.
   First Capital, with about <PERCENT>40%</PERCENT> of its investments in
high-yield investments, is the second major junk bond-laden
insurer to come under regulatory control in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> in the
past month. It's roughly half the size of <ORGANIZATION>First Executive
Corp.</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Executive Life Insurance Co.</ORGANIZATION> unit, seized by
regulators on <DATE>April 11</DATE>. <PERSON>Mr. Garamendi</PERSON> said that <ORGANIZATION>First
Capital</ORGANIZATION>'s financial problems aren't as severe as those of
<ORGANIZATION>First Executive</ORGANIZATION>'s units.
   Although he asserted that <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION> has serious
problems, <PERSON>Mr. Garamendi</PERSON> announced a series of measures that
he said cure the company's woes, among them the sale of a
part of the company's business, a search for added capital,
and a program to sell the company's junk bonds -- which
sparked <DATE>Friday</DATE>'s swoon in the bond market. "We believe
policyholders will receive <PERCENT>100%</PERCENT> of contracted benefits," he
told reporters.
   But analysts were far less assured of a happy outcome and
speculated that there may be a "black hole," in the words of
one, of prospective losses. Among other things, the failure
of <ORGANIZATION>American Express</ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION>Citicorp</ORGANIZATION> to recapitalize the troubled
insurer concerned observers. Based on public numbers, such a
recapitalization would by one estimate require between <MONEY>$100
million</MONEY> and <MONEY>$200 million</MONEY> -- a relatively small sum for these
institutions, if it fixed the problem.
   "I have to wonder whether there's something that I just
don't know here and which the public hasn't been told," said
<PERSON>Ray Dirks</PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION>Baird, Patrick &amp; Co.</ORGANIZATION>, who has in the
past recommended the stock of <ORGANIZATION>First Capital Holdings</ORGANIZATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>American Express</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Citicorp</ORGANIZATION> declined to comment on the
failure, to date, of their rescue talks with <PERSON>Mr. Garamendi</PERSON>.
   But a number of signs point to crumbling foundations at
<ORGANIZATION>First Capital Holdings</ORGANIZATION> and its units. Although the company
posted net income for <DATE>1990</DATE> of <MONEY>$7 million</MONEY>, or <MONEY>15 cents</MONEY> a
share, on revenue of <MONEY>$980.7 million</MONEY>, its bond and real estate
investments showed marked weaknesses.
   A particular concern with analysts is the company's bond
portfolio, consisting not only of junk bonds, but in many
cases ones for which there is no active market. The so-called
"market value" of the insurer's bonds was about <MONEY>$700 million</MONEY>
less than the value at which they were carried on the
company's books at <DATE>Dec. 31</DATE> -- a gap almost twice the <MONEY>$383.8
million</MONEY> in shareholder equity at that date.
   However, only about <PERCENT>10%</PERCENT> of the company's <MONEY>$7.48 billion</MONEY> in
short-term and long-term securities was valued by market
quotes. Market values for the rest were determined by various
"statistical services" and "internal methods," according to
the company's annual filing with the <ORGANIZATION>Securities and Exchange
Commission</ORGANIZATION>.
   While the company's junk bond problems predominate, there
are other serious weaknesses. Some <PERCENT>12%</PERCENT> of the company's <MONEY>$275
million</MONEY> mortgage loan portfolio has interest more than 90
days overdue or is in foreclosure proceedings -- more than
twice the insurance industry average.
   <ORGANIZATION>American Express</ORGANIZATION>'s <MONEY>$144 million</MONEY> charge is likely to
produce a <DATE>second-quarter</DATE> loss at its <ORGANIZATION>Shearson Lehman Brothers</ORGANIZATION>
securities unit. And <ORGANIZATION>American Express</ORGANIZATION> may face additional
future costs from its association with <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION>. About
three-quarters of the policies and annuities issued by <ORGANIZATION>First
Capital</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> insurance unit (formerly <ORGANIZATION>E.F. Hutton
Life Insurance Co.</ORGANIZATION>) are held by <ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION> customers -- a
potential legal liability if <ORGANIZATION>First Capital Life</ORGANIZATION> fails.
   <ORGANIZATION>American Express</ORGANIZATION> has resisted <PERSON>Mr. Garamendi</PERSON>'s demands that
it inject capital into <ORGANIZATION>First Capital Life</ORGANIZATION> but says it is
still "in discussions" with the commissioner.
   <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION>'s problems also mean bad news for <ORGANIZATION>Citibank</ORGANIZATION>,
which last year led the syndicate that lent <MONEY>$275 million</MONEY> to
<ORGANIZATION>First Capital Holdings</ORGANIZATION>. <DATE>Friday</DATE>'s cease and desist orders
block the flow of cash between <ORGANIZATION>First Capital Life</ORGANIZATION> and its
parent. Some bankers have said that <ORGANIZATION>Citibank</ORGANIZATION> still holds most
of the <MONEY>$275 million</MONEY> loan because few other banks were willing
to buy portions of the debt. <ORGANIZATION>Citicorp</ORGANIZATION> declines to say how
much of the loan it still holds or whether it has reserved
against a potential loss on the loan.

   Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., a unit of American Express
Corp., is discussing a bailout plan for ailing First Capital
Life Insurance Co. in order to protect Shearson customers who
bought First Capital policies, sources close to the talks
said.
   In recent weeks, talks with California insurance
commissioner John Garamendi have led to a Shearson proposal
to inject roughly $50 million to boost the capital levels of
First Capital Life, which was seized by regulators last
spring, according to one person close to the situation. First
Capital Life is a unit of First Capital Holdings Corp., both
of Los Angeles.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A large portion of the policies of <ORGANIZATION>First Capital Life</ORGANIZATION> were
sold through <ORGANIZATION>E.F. Hutton &amp; Co.</ORGANIZATION>, which <ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION> acquired after
the stock-market crash in <DATE>1987</DATE>. As a result, <ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION> is said
to be trying to come to an agreement with <PERSON>Mr. Garamendi</PERSON> to
protect its customers. New York-based <ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION> may also be
trying to protect itself against potentially large lawsuits
from policyholders and shareholders.
   Shearson is also proposing to provide a guarantee of the
company's policyholder obligations that would give
policyholders <MONEY>100 cents</MONEY> on the dollar and a minimum interest
rate on annuities and interest-bearing policies, one person
close to the talks said. Under the plan, however,
policyholders wouldn't be able to withdraw their money for
five years without paying a stiff penalty, the individual
said. The guarantee from <ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION> would be backed up by
<ORGANIZATION>American Express</ORGANIZATION>, people close to the talks said.
   A spokesman for <ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION> said the company is "engaged in
discussions with the insurance commissioner in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>."
He declined to elaborate. A spokesman for the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>
insurance department also said talks were "progressing."
   <PERSON>Mr. Garamendi</PERSON> tried last <DATE>spring</DATE> to convince <ORGANIZATION>American
Express</ORGANIZATION> to ante up roughly <MONEY>$60 million</MONEY> in capital for <ORGANIZATION>First
Capital Life</ORGANIZATION>, which was struggling with a large junk bond
portfolio. <PERSON>Mr. Garamendi</PERSON> took control of the insurer, however
when <ORGANIZATION>American Express</ORGANIZATION> balked at the idea. <ORGANIZATION>First Capital
Holdings</ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, filed for bankruptcy protection.
   Meanwhile, <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> regulators are said to be close to
unveiling a rescue plan for <ORGANIZATION>Fidelity Bankers Life Insurance
Co.</ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION>Richmond</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Va.</LOCATION>, unit of <ORGANIZATION>First Capital Holdings</ORGANIZATION>, which
was seized soon after the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> unit. As many as eight
potential buyers are said to be interested in buying in the
unit, including <ORGANIZATION>First Capital Holdings</ORGANIZATION>, which is still in
bankruptcy proceedings, a person close to the situation said.
   Though talks between <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>'s insurance regulators and
<ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>American Express</ORGANIZATION> have continued intermittently
since last <DATE>spring</DATE>, the discussions recently began to "move
forward," according to a person close to the negotiations. A
final agreement could be as long as two weeks away, however.
   A plan to rescue <ORGANIZATION>First Capital Life</ORGANIZATION> involving <ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION>
could run aground if a battle with creditors erupts over
their treatment under the proposal. <ORGANIZATION>Citicorp</ORGANIZATION> is owed roughly
<MONEY>$260 million</MONEY> under a loan to <ORGANIZATION>First Capital Holdings</ORGANIZATION> that is
secured by the stock of both of its life insurance units.
   It is unclear how much, if anything, <ORGANIZATION>Citicorp</ORGANIZATION> would
receive under the plan. The banking company holds roughly
two-thirds of the loan. <ORGANIZATION>First Capital Holdings</ORGANIZATION> also has
roughly <MONEY>$120 million</MONEY> in subordinated debt outstanding.
   In an unusual move <DATE>several weeks ago</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Citicorp</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>National
Westminster Bank</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>NationsBank</ORGANIZATION> resigned from the creditors
committee overseeing the bankruptcy proceedings of <ORGANIZATION>First
Capital Holdings</ORGANIZATION>. One person close to the situation said the
group resigned because they are secured creditors, while the
other creditors are not.

or the sale of a large number of the insurance company's junk bonds in the
open market.;    Both moves, if successful, would help <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION>'s
troubled financial position.;    These executives said at least two potential
buyers for the universal life business had held discussions with <ORGANIZATION>Salomon</ORGANIZATION>,
although their names could not be immediately determined.;    A <ORGANIZATION>Salomon</ORGANIZATION>
spokesman did not return a telephone message Sunday.;    The scramble to deal
with <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION> comes amid increasing concerns about the health of some
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> insurance companies.;    Last month, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> regulators seized control
of <ORGANIZATION>Executive Life Insurance Co.</ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION>First Executive Corp.</ORGANIZATION>;   
Executive Life was then the insurance company with the largest portfolio of
junk bonds. <PERSON>Garamendi</PERSON>, who oversaw the seizure, said the company was in a
hazardous financial condition, primarily because of defaults and the declining
values in its junk bond portfolio.;    A recent accounting change also has
hurt <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION>. As a result of the change, which affects how insurance
companies define junk bonds, <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION>, which reported <DATE>last year</DATE> that <PERCENT>20.2
percent</PERCENT> of its assets were in junk bonds, has increased that figure to 40.7
percent.;    The negotiations between <ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> regulators are a
result largely of the Wall Street firm's ill-fated acquisition in <DATE>1988</DATE> of <ORGANIZATION>E.F.
Hutton &amp; Co</ORGANIZATION>. Hutton ran an insurance company, called <ORGANIZATION>E.F. Hutton Life</ORGANIZATION>, which
it sold in <DATE>1987</DATE> to <ORGANIZATION>First Capital Holdings</ORGANIZATION>, the parent of <ORGANIZATION>First Capital Life.</ORGANIZATION>; 
  When <ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION> bought <PERSON>Hutton</PERSON>, it acquired a <PERCENT>44 percent</PERCENT> interest in <ORGANIZATION>First
Capital Holdings</ORGANIZATION>, whose products the firm began to market.  </TEXT>

   California's insurance commissioner and American Express
Co. made little progress in their talks about a possible
rescue of First Capital Holdings Corp., amid signs that the
commissioner may soon take action against First Capital's
main unit.
   The commissioner, John Garamendi, met in New York
yesterday with Howard L. Clark Jr., chairman of American
Express's Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. securities unit.
According to people familiar with the talks, Mr. Garamendi
expressed reservations about plans proposed by Shearson that
would aid Shearson clients who bought policies from a unit of
First Capital, a Los Angeles-based insurance holding company.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   <PERSON>Mr. Garamendi</PERSON> is seeking a solution that would help all
policyholders of <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION>, which has been hurt by its
large investments in the high-risk, high-yield securities
called junk bonds. First Capital had <MONEY>$747 million</MONEY> in paper
losses on its <MONEY>$3.15 billion</MONEY> junk bond portfolio at year end
and <MONEY>$120 million</MONEY> of paper losses on other investments,
according to a filing with the <ORGANIZATION>Securities and Exchange
Commission</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>Mr. Garamendi</PERSON> had originally asked New York-based <ORGANIZATION>American
Express</ORGANIZATION> to put cash into <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION>, but <ORGANIZATION>American Express</ORGANIZATION>
has rebuffed that suggestion, according to people familiar
with the talks.
   <PERSON>Mr. Garamendi</PERSON> is also talking with officials of <ORGANIZATION>Citicorp</ORGANIZATION>,
whose main unit was the lead bank in a <MONEY>$275 million</MONEY> loan to
<ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION> last year.
   First Capital, which is <PERCENT>28%</PERCENT> owned by <ORGANIZATION>American Express</ORGANIZATION>, has
about <MONEY>$8 billion</MONEY> in assets and is roughly half the size of
<LOCATION>Los Angeles-based</LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION>First Executive Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, which last month
became the largest <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> insurance holding company to fail,
also because of losses on junk bonds. If regulators have to
take control of <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION>'s insurance units, one of
several possible actions, it will add significantly to a
burden of insurance insolvencies that is already the largest
in history.
   Although <PERSON>Mr. Garamendi</PERSON> is continuing to talk to both
<ORGANIZATION>American Express</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Citicorp</ORGANIZATION> about <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION>'s problems,
he is concerned that publicity about <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION>'s woes
could lead to an increase in requests from policyholders to
withdraw their funds, people familiar with the discussions
said.
   Spokesmen for <ORGANIZATION>American Express</ORGANIZATION> and New York-based <ORGANIZATION>Citicorp</ORGANIZATION>
declined to comment. A spokesman for <PERSON>Mr. Garamendi</PERSON> confirmed
that the commissioner met with <PERSON>Mr. Clark</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION> but
declined to elaborate. Spokesmen for <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION> said they
were aware of the meeting, which comes in the wake of
separate discussions between the commissioner and the company
over the infusion of more capital into the company's main
unit, <ORGANIZATION>First Capital Life Insurance Co</ORGANIZATION>. They declined further
comment.
   <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION> bought an insurance unit of the former <ORGANIZATION>E.F.
Hutton &amp; Co.</ORGANIZATION> shortly before <ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION> acquired <PERSON>Hutton</PERSON>. As a
result, many <ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION> customers hold policies issued by <ORGANIZATION>First
Capital Life Insurance</ORGANIZATION>.

   LOS ANGELES -- California regulators yesterday formally
seized control of First Capital Life Insurance Co. after
senior creditors sought to have the parent, First Capital
Holdings Co., put into involuntary bankruptcy.
   The bankruptcy petition by Citibank and other creditors
wasn't expected and appears to have interrupted California
Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi's efforts to revitalize
First Capital Life without a complete takeover.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In response to the bankruptcy petition, <PERSON>Mr. Garamendi</PERSON>
yesterday entered an order of conservation against <ORGANIZATION>First
Capital Life</ORGANIZATION>, giving the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> insurance department full
operating control over the company. <PERSON>Mr. Garamendi</PERSON> said he
took the formal action to protect policyholders from
uncertainties created by the creditors' bankruptcy petition.
   On <DATE>Friday</DATE>, <PERSON>Mr. Garamendi</PERSON> had instituted narrower
cease-and-desist orders against the company, barring policy
redemptions and loans but affirming normal payments of death
benefits and annuities.
   In an interview, the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> insurance commissioner
said he has been in talks with <ORGANIZATION>Citibank</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>American Express
Co.</ORGANIZATION>, holder of a <PERCENT>28%</PERCENT> stake in <ORGANIZATION>First Capital Holdings</ORGANIZATION>. "We
knew that it was possible that there might be a bankruptcy
filing when we cut {the holding company's} air hose off" with
the cease-and-desist order. "But now it's going to be a lot
more work and responsibilities."
   <ORGANIZATION>Citibank</ORGANIZATION>'s motives for the petition weren't entirely
clear. The bank said only that its action was "an attempt to
protect the bank group's rights." As recently as <DATE>last
Thursday</DATE>, people familiar with <ORGANIZATION>Citibank</ORGANIZATION> sought to minimize
<ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION>'s troubles and said the company wasn't
delinquent in its obligations under the loan agreement.
   The petition for involuntary bankruptcy under Chapter 11
of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Bankruptcy Code was filed by <ORGANIZATION>Citibank</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of
New York-based <ORGANIZATION>Citicorp</ORGANIZATION>, as agent for a <MONEY>$275 million</MONEY>
syndicated credit agreement. The filing in federal court in
<LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> asserted that <MONEY>$120 million</MONEY> is due and outstanding
under a term loan and that about <MONEY>$11.6 million</MONEY> is due as
reimbursements of payouts under a letter of credit.
   It's believed that <ORGANIZATION>Citibank</ORGANIZATION> is owed about <MONEY>$175 million</MONEY> of
the <MONEY>$275 million</MONEY> loan total. <ORGANIZATION>Citibank</ORGANIZATION> put its portion of the
<ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION> loan on non-performing status, according to
people familiar with the discussions. The step's actual
impact on <DATE>second-quarter</DATE> earnings will depend on whether and
how much <ORGANIZATION>Citicorp</ORGANIZATION> sets aside as a provision for possible
losses on the loan.
   <ORGANIZATION>Citibank</ORGANIZATION>'s filing, supported by two other members of the
banking group, <ORGANIZATION>Mitsui Manufacturers Bank</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>National
Westminster Bank</ORGANIZATION>, says the loan is secured by stock in
various units of <ORGANIZATION>First Capital Holdings</ORGANIZATION>, including <ORGANIZATION>First
Capital Life</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Fidelity Bankers Life Insurance Co.</ORGANIZATION>, which
was taken over <DATE>Monday</DATE> by <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> regulators.
   A spokesman for <ORGANIZATION>First Capital Holdings</ORGANIZATION> and its
subsidiaries said the Los Angeles-based company was
"considering its options" and that the company believed the
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION> insurance commissioner's formal takeover of <ORGANIZATION>First
Capital Life</ORGANIZATION> "was the best way to protect the policies of our
customers."
   <ORGANIZATION>First Capital Holdings</ORGANIZATION> has 20 days to respond to
<ORGANIZATION>Citibank</ORGANIZATION>'s court request for involuntary bankruptcy.
   Some observers speculated that the petition may have been
filed to forestall any temptation by <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION>
regulators to grab holding company assets in satisfaction of
insurance-company debts. Among other things, the holding
company has about <MONEY>$30 million</MONEY> in cash. With the petition in
place, any such transactions would be subject to court
scrutiny.

<TEXT>
MR <PERSON>JOHN Garamendi</PERSON>, the rec-ently-appointed Californian insurance
commissioner, yesterday issued a 'cease and desist' order against <ORGANIZATION>First
Capital Life Insurance Company</ORGANIZATION>, a San Diego-based insurer whose parent
company is 28 per cent-owned by <ORGANIZATION>Shearson Lehman Brothers</ORGANIZATION>.
The order prohibits <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION> from making payments to its parent
company, <ORGANIZATION>First Capital Holdings</ORGANIZATION>, or to its affiliates without the
Commissioner's permission, and from writing new business.
It also places a moratorium on surrenders by <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION> policyholders and
on life insurance policy loans.
Announcing the order, <PERSON>Mr Garamendi</PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION> was in a 'hazardous'
financial condition. Concern about the company's position had triggered a
wave of surrenders in recent days, thus compounding its problems, he said.
First Capital is not large - its assets are Dollars 4.5bn and it has 190,000
policyholders - but the authorities' intervention comes at a sensitive time.
Last month, a much bigger Californian insurer, <ORGANIZATION>First Executive</ORGANIZATION>, was seized
by the regulators after concerns about its heavy junk bond portfolio
prompted a similar wave of surrenders and a collapse of its marketing
network.
Like First Executive, much of <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION> problems stem from sizeable junk
bond exposure.
The Commissioner has been putting pressure on <ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION> to help shore up the
insurer, but no deal has emerged.
Shearson Lehman <TIME>last night</TIME> said it will take a Dollars 144m <DATE>second quarter</DATE>
pre-tax charge related to its investment in <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION>, Dow Jones reports
from <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>.

   LOS ANGELES -- California regulators are looking into
whether two top officers of a now-failed First Capital
Holdings Corp. insurance unit improperly redeemed personal
insurance or annuity policies shortly before the unit was
seized by the state, a California insurance department
official said.
   The official, a spokesman for California Insurance
Commissioner John Garamendi, said the commissioner met
yesterday with Fred A. Buck, president of First Capital Life
Insurance Co. and with Julia S. Kelly, a senior vice
president, to discuss their actions.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The two may have redeemed policies sometime before
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION> regulators seized <ORGANIZATION>First Capital Life</ORGANIZATION>, on <DATE>May 14</DATE>.
The commissioner and his officials are looking into whether
the company's officers improperly put themselves ahead of
other policyholders in making redemptions. It isn't clear
whether such actions would violate <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> insurance law.
   <PERSON>Mr. Garamendi</PERSON>'s spokesman declined to elaborate on either
the meeting or the investigation. <PERSON>Mr. Buck</PERSON> and <PERSON>Ms. Kelly</PERSON>
couldn't be reached.
   <ORGANIZATION>First Capital Life</ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>, is a unit of Los
Angeles-based <ORGANIZATION>First Capital Holdings</ORGANIZATION>, which has said it plans
to file for Chapter 11 protection from creditors. <ORGANIZATION>First
Capital Holdings</ORGANIZATION>' other major insurance unit, <ORGANIZATION>Fidelity
Bankers Life Insurance Co.</ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION>Richmond</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Va.</LOCATION>, was
seized by regulators in that state on <DATE>May 13</DATE>.

<TEXT>
<ORGANIZATION>AMERICAN Express</ORGANIZATION> and its <ORGANIZATION>Shearson Lehman</ORGANIZATION> investment banking subsidiary have
agreed to inject Dollars 50m in <ORGANIZATION>First Capital Life Insurance</ORGANIZATION> (FCL), the
ailing life company seized last <DATE>May</DATE> by state insurance regulators. They have
also agreed to underpin the value of policyholders' contracts.
The aim is to rehabilitate the insurer, whose troubles stemmed largely from
its heavy junk bond exposure and a significant policyholder run last year.
As part of the deal with the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> regulators, <ORGANIZATION>American Express</ORGANIZATION> and
<ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION> will take over management of FCL - earning a 'modest' but
undisclosed fee - while selling down a portion of the junk bond portfolio.
During a five-year rehabilitation programme and for a short period after
this, they will also have an option to acquire 100 per cent of <ORGANIZATION>First
Capital</ORGANIZATION>'s assets and liabilities at <MONEY>20 per cent</MONEY> of their
actuarial-determined value. At end-1991, <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION> had around Dollars
4bn in assets, 190,000 policyholders and 60,000 annuitants.
The involvement of <ORGANIZATION>American Express</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION> with <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION> dates
back to the <DATE>1980s</DATE>. In <DATE>November 1988</DATE>, <PERSON>Robert Weingarten</PERSON>, who had built the
fast-growing company partly by acquisitions and partly by selling highly
competitive policies backed by a high-yielding portfolio of junk bonds, sold
his family stake in the insurer's parent company to <ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION>.
Shearson, meanwhile, sold a large number of <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION> policies to its
own clients between <DATE>1986</DATE> and <DATE>1991</DATE>.
When the junk bond market collapsed and the troubles at neighbouring
Executive Life, another junk bond-ridden <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> insurer, hit the
headlines, many <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION> policyholders sought to cash in their
policies. Around 36,000 contracts were surrendered between <DATE>January 1991</DATE> and
<DATE>May</DATE>, when the regulators stepped in.
Last <DATE>spring</DATE>, <PERSON>Mr John Garamendi</PERSON>, the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> insurance commissioner, had
sought a capital infusion from <ORGANIZATION>American Express/Shearson</ORGANIZATION> - which holds a 28
per cent stake in <ORGANIZATION>First Capital Holdings</ORGANIZATION>, the bankrupt parent company - but
he met resistance. Asked yesterday why this solution had taken so long to
arrange, he said only that it was 'a very complex business'.

   NEW YORK -- Shearson Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., bowing
to pressure from angry customers, agreed to inject $50
million into ailing First Capital Life Insurance Co. and to
guarantee the full value of policyholders' accounts.
   The accord, which was expected, will help protect all
policyholders, including 150,000 Shearson customers, against
losses on annuities they bought from the insurer. The
agreement also will help insulate Shearson, a unit of
American Express Co., from the threat of embarrassing and
costly policyholder litigation.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The agreement represents a turnabout by <ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION>, which
balked last <DATE>spring</DATE> when <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> Insurance Commissioner
<PERSON>John Garamendi</PERSON> asked <ORGANIZATION>American Express</ORGANIZATION> to inject <MONEY>$60 million</MONEY>
into <ORGANIZATION>First Capital Life</ORGANIZATION>, which was hurt by junk-bond losses.
At the time, <ORGANIZATION>American Express</ORGANIZATION> was willing to bail out only
<ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION> customers, roughly <PERCENT>60%</PERCENT> of the total 250,000
policyholders and annuitants of the insurer. <ORGANIZATION>American Express</ORGANIZATION>
owns <PERCENT>28%</PERCENT> of <ORGANIZATION>First Capital Holdings Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, the Los
Angeles-based parent of <ORGANIZATION>First Capital Life</ORGANIZATION>.
   The agreement "represents a commitment from <ORGANIZATION>American
Express</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION> to help not only those policyholders who
are <ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION> customers but all policyholders," said <PERSON>Mr.
Garamendi</PERSON>, who announced the accord in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> yesterday
along with <PERSON>Howard L. Clark Jr.</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION>'s chairman.
   Shearson agreed to manage the San Diego-based insurer and
will also reduce <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION>'s <MONEY>$1.2 billion</MONEY> junk-bond
holdings by <MONEY>$450 million</MONEY>.
   In exchange for its guarantee of obligations of the
insurer, <ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION> has the right under the plan to receive <PERCENT>80%</PERCENT>
of the profit of <ORGANIZATION>First Capital Life</ORGANIZATION> in the future. In
negotiations with creditors, including a syndicate of banks
led by <ORGANIZATION>Citicorp</ORGANIZATION> that are owed <MONEY>$260 million</MONEY>, <PERSON>Mr. Garamendi</PERSON> and
<ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION> have offered them the right to a <PERCENT>20%</PERCENT> share in the
insurer's profits. Creditors haven't yet agreed to a deal,
however.
   Shearson and <ORGANIZATION>American Express</ORGANIZATION> still could be subject to
large liabilities under the guarantee to policyholders,
however. <PERSON>Mr. Clark</PERSON> said he believes the insurer is currently
financially healthy enough to cover its obligation to
policyholders.
   To receive the full value of their policies, policyholders
will be required to keep their policies with <ORGANIZATION>First Capital
Life</ORGANIZATION> for five years. Though they will continue to receive the
guaranteed interest rates on their contracts for now, rates
on policyholders' policies are likely to be cut, in many
cases in a year or less, based on the performance of <ORGANIZATION>First
Capital</ORGANIZATION>'s investments. The agreement calls for a minimum rate
of <PERCENT>4%</PERCENT> to be paid to policyholders.
   Policyholders who surrender their policies before the plan
is in effect or during the first year of the plan will
receive <PERCENT>75%</PERCENT> of their cash value. The cash value paid
increases in the second year to <PERCENT>77%</PERCENT> and rises to <PERCENT>95%</PERCENT> during
the fifth year.
   The agreement is pending settlement of policyholder
litigation filed in both state and federal court in
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION>. As part of the settlement with policyholders,
<ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION> agreed to refund a percentage of the surrender
charges paid by policyholders who withdrew their money
between <DATE>January 1990</DATE>, and <DATE>May 13, 1991</DATE>, the day before the
insurer was seized by <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>.
   In an unusual concession to former policyholders, <ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION>
also offered the 36,000 policyholders who withdrew their cash
values a chance to reinstate their policies. They would be
credited the full amount of surrender charges already paid.
   The agreement doesn't include policyholders of <ORGANIZATION>Fidelity
Bankers Life Insurance Co.</ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> unit of <ORGANIZATION>First
Capital Holdings</ORGANIZATION>. Insurance regulators in <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> are said
to be in negotiations with several potential buyers for that
company, which is considered the stronger of the two units.

<LEADPARA>  Negotiations between executives of Shearson Lehman and California insurance
regulators broke down Monday, as an effort to avert a potential failure of
First Capital Life Insurance Co. grew more intense, people who have been

insurance company, which has more investments in "junk bonds" than other
insurers still operating.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  INSURER'S PLANS FOR BAILOUT REJECTED  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Plans called insufficient;    But both proposals were rejected by <PERSON>John
Garamendi</PERSON>, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>'s insurance commissioner, as being insufficient to deal
with the company's deteriorating finances.;    <ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION>, which is the largest
seller of <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION>'s policies and owns <PERCENT>28 percent</PERCENT> of the company's
parent, offered proposals that would address the risks only to holders of
policies sold through the Wall Street firm.;    <PERSON>Garamendi</PERSON> rejected those
proposals because he wanted a comprehensive solution to the company's
troubles, people who have been briefed on the discussions said.;    Rush to
find solution;    The breakdown in the talks set off a rush to find a solution
to <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION>'s situation, as <PERSON>Garamendi</PERSON> approached other financial
institutions for help. But people familiar with the situation said there was a
growing concern that anxieties in the marketplace might overtake the efforts,
resulting in a seizure of the insurance company.;    "The real problem now is
that there is real doubt about whether there is time remaining to work
anything out," one person familiar with the <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION> situation said.
"Everybody is under pressure to come up with a solution before time runs
out.";    A spokesman for <PERSON>Garamendi</PERSON> confirmed talks with <ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION> executives
had been held <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME>, but declined to elaborate. A spokesman for
<ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION> declined to comment.;    <ORGANIZATION>Citicorp</ORGANIZATION> approached;    As the <ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION>
talks were hitting snags, <PERSON>Garamendi</PERSON> was said to have approached executives at
<ORGANIZATION>Citicorp</ORGANIZATION>, which was said to be a significant lender to <ORGANIZATION>First Capital Holdings</ORGANIZATION>,
the insurance company's parent.;    The hope, according to people who have
been briefed on those talks, is that <ORGANIZATION>Citicorp</ORGANIZATION> would infuse more capital into
the company to help preserve the quality of outstanding loans. A <ORGANIZATION>Citicorp</ORGANIZATION>
spokeswoman did not return a telephone call <DATE>Monday</DATE> night.;    At the same
time, <ORGANIZATION>Salomon Brothers</ORGANIZATION>, which has been hired by <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION> to deal with its
unraveling finances, was said still to be exploring possible ways that the
insurance company could raise the badly needed cash. Those plans were said to
include selling off one of the company's businesses, or selling a large
portfolio of its junk bond holdings.;    The flurry of activity came in the
shadow of the recent seizure of <ORGANIZATION>Executive Life Insurance Co.</ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of
<ORGANIZATION>First Executive Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, which had been the insurance company with the largest
portfolio of junk bonds.;    <PERSON>Garamendi</PERSON>, who oversaw the seizure, said at the
time that the company was in hazardous financial condition, primarily because
of defaults and declining values in that portfolio.;    The seizure of the
<ORGANIZATION>First Executive</ORGANIZATION> unit intensified concerns among regulators and the financial
community about the health of a number of other insurance companies, including
First Capital.;    An accounting change recently also hit <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION>'s
capital base very hard. As a result of the change, <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION>, which was
reporting last year that <PERCENT>20.2 percent</PERCENT> of its assets were in junk bonds, has
raised that figure to 40.7 percent.;    After the seizure of <ORGANIZATION>First Executive</ORGANIZATION>,
<PERSON>Garamendi</PERSON> arranged two weeks ago to meet with <PERSON>Howard Clark Jr.</PERSON>, chairman and
chief executive of <ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON>James D. Robinson III</PERSON>, chairman and chief
executive of <ORGANIZATION>American Express Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION>'s parent. The recent negotiations
with the firm followed those meetings.;    <PERSON>Garamendi</PERSON>'s concerns <DATE>Monday</DATE> were
said to have stemmed largely from what he saw as extensive problems at <ORGANIZATION>First
Capital Holdings</ORGANIZATION>, at both its <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> subsidiary, <ORGANIZATION>Fidelity Capital</ORGANIZATION>, and its
<LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> subsidiary, <ORGANIZATION>Fidelity Bankers Life Insurance Co.</ORGANIZATION>, which has <PERCENT>37.6
percent</PERCENT> of its assets in junk bonds, according to <ORGANIZATION>Weiss Research</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>West Palm
Beach</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla.</LOCATION>, firm. That is second only to <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>California.</LOCATION>;    The
proposals rejected <DATE>Monday</DATE> by <PERSON>Garamendi</PERSON> involved <ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION>'s protection of its
customers who bought policies through the firm.;    Under the more radical
proposal, <ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION> would guarantee a portfolio of more than <MONEY>$2 billion</MONEY> that is
backing the policies and contracts of <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION> that are held by <ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION>
customers.;    Once the guarantee was made, the firm would begin a push to get
holders of the policies to cash them in, executives briefed on the talks said.
The portfolio contains investments in a range of securities, including a large
amount of the junk bonds that were purchased by <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION>.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  A dispute between Shearson Lehman Brothers and California insurance regulators
intensified Tuesday, with the state's insurance commissioner contending that
the Wall Street firm had a responsibility to infuse First Capital Life
Insurance Co. with more capital.;    The struggling insurance company has more
investments in "junk bonds" than any other insurer still independently
operating.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     <ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION>, which owns <PERCENT>28 percent</PERCENT> of the insurer's parent, has been the
largest seller on Wall Street of the company's policies and contracts.;    The
dispute comes after more than two weeks of negotiations between the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>
regulators and executives of <ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION> and its parent, <ORGANIZATION>American Express Co</ORGANIZATION>. On
<DATE>Monday</DATE>, those talks broke down when the regulators rejected proposals by
<ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION> to protect its own customers who had purchased <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION>
products. <PERSON>John Garamendi</PERSON>, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>'s insurance commissioner, was said to be
seeking a more comprehensive solution to the problem.;    In statements
<DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, <PERSON>Garamendi</PERSON> said that the financial problems of <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION> appeared
to be extensive, and that both <ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>American Express</ORGANIZATION> needed to take
action to handle the entire problem, rather than protecting only their
customers.;    "Our continuing review" of the <ORGANIZATION>First Capital Life Insurance
Company</ORGANIZATION> "indicates that the company needs a substantial infusion of cash,"
<PERSON>Garamendi</PERSON> said. "This is <ORGANIZATION>Shearson Lehman</ORGANIZATION>'s and <ORGANIZATION>American Express</ORGANIZATION>'
responsibility.";    He added that the position in <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION> had been
purchased "so that they would have annuities and life insurance products to
sell through their financial consultants, and sell they did.";    <PERSON>Garamendi</PERSON>
said that from <DATE>1986</DATE> through the <DATE>first quarter of this year</DATE>, more than <PERCENT>75
percent</PERCENT> of <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION>'s business was produced by <ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION>American
Express</ORGANIZATION> employees.;    He said that, in that time, the two companies
"generated more than <MONEY>$3 billion</MONEY> worth of <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION> business. Meanwhile,
the percentage of non-investment grade assets of <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION> grew from less
than <PERCENT>15 percent</PERCENT> to more than <PERCENT>40 percent</PERCENT> of total assets." A recent accounting
rule change was responsible for much of that change, increasing the junk bond
holdings <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION> reported from <PERCENT>20.2 percent</PERCENT> of its assets to 40.7
percent.;    <PERSON>Garamendi</PERSON> said he believed that both <ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>American
Express</ORGANIZATION> should make sure that <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION> was viable, and referred to
<ORGANIZATION>American Express</ORGANIZATION>'s well-known advertising campaign.;    "If membership has its
privileges, than ownership has its responsibilities," he said.  </TEXT>

   LOS ANGELES -- First Capital Holdings Corp. and its two
life insurance holding company subsidiaries filed a joint
plan of reorganization in U.S. Bankruptcy Court here.
   Under terms of the proposed plan, First Capital Holdings'
senior secured lenders -- a syndicate of banks led by
Citicorp would receive 100% of the outstanding stock of the
two life insurance holding company subsidiaries. The banks
hold $260 million of senior secured debt.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The reorganization plan deals with companies at the
holding company level. They are <ORGANIZATION>First Capital Life Insurance
Group Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a holding company for <ORGANIZATION>San Diego-based First
Capital Life Insurance Co.</ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION>Fidelity Bankers Insurance
Group</ORGANIZATION>, a holding company whose principal asset is stock in
Virginia-based <ORGANIZATION>Fidelity Bankers Life Insurance Co</ORGANIZATION>.
   Last week, <ORGANIZATION>Shearson Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, bowing
to pressure from angry customers, agreed to inject <MONEY>$50
million</MONEY> into ailing <ORGANIZATION>First Capital Life Insurance Co.</ORGANIZATION> and to
guarantee the full value of policyholders' accounts. The
accord will help protect all policyholders, including 150,000
Shearson customers, against losses on annuities they bought
from the insurance company. <ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION> is a unit of <ORGANIZATION>New
York-based American Express Co</ORGANIZATION>.
   According to <PERSON>Charles Perkins</PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION>First
Capital Holdings</ORGANIZATION>, this plan of reorganization doesn't affect
<ORGANIZATION>First Capital Life</ORGANIZATION> policyholders' accounts and the <ORGANIZATION>Shearson
Lehman Brothers</ORGANIZATION> guarantee. <PERSON>Mr. Perkins</PERSON> said the plan does,
however, reduce <ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION>'s share of <ORGANIZATION>First Capital Life</ORGANIZATION>'s
future profit to <PERCENT>60%</PERCENT> from <PERCENT>80%</PERCENT>. <PERSON>Mr. Perkins</PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION> was
involved in the negotiations for the plan of reorganization.
   <ORGANIZATION>First Capital Life Insurance Group</ORGANIZATION> would continue to hold
a <PERCENT>100%</PERCENT> equity interest in the rehabilitated <ORGANIZATION>First Capital
Life</ORGANIZATION>, subject to an option held by <ORGANIZATION>Shearson Lehman</ORGANIZATION> to acquire
the assets and liabilities of <ORGANIZATION>First Capital Life</ORGANIZATION> at a price
equal to <PERCENT>40%</PERCENT> of their fair market value. <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> Insurance
Commissioner <PERSON>John Garamendi</PERSON>, who played a key role in getting
<ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION> to make the investment in <ORGANIZATION>First Capital Life</ORGANIZATION>, said
he had no comment on the reorganization plan.
   <ORGANIZATION>Fidelity Bankers Life Insurance Co.</ORGANIZATION> is being operated
under the conservatorship of the <ORGANIZATION>Virginia Insurance
Commissioner</ORGANIZATION>. The commissioner is currently evaluating
various proposals for the rehabilitation of the insurance
company. A spokesman for the <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> insurance commissioner
said he had no comment on the reorganization plan.
   General unsecured creditors of <ORGANIZATION>First Capital Holdings
Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and the two life insurance holding company subsidiaries
would receive cash equal to <PERCENT>50%</PERCENT> of their claim, subject to
overall "caps," according to the plan.
   Holders of <ORGANIZATION>First Capital Holdings</ORGANIZATION>' <PERCENT>13%</PERCENT> senior subordinated
debentures would receive no distribution or other
consideration under the proposed plan. <ORGANIZATION>First Capital Holdings</ORGANIZATION>
would be dissolved, and the holders of common stock of <ORGANIZATION>First
Capital Holdings</ORGANIZATION> would receive no distribution or other
consideration under the proposed plan.
   The proposed reorganization plan is subject to execution
of a comprehensive settlement among <ORGANIZATION>Shearson Lehman Brothers
Holdings</ORGANIZATION>, the debtor companies and certain officers,
directors and lenders of the debtor companies; final orders
approving the rehabilitation of <ORGANIZATION>First Capital Life</ORGANIZATION> and
<ORGANIZATION>Fidelity Bankers Life</ORGANIZATION>; settlement of policyholders' and other
class-action litigation; and bankruptcy court approval.
   <ORGANIZATION>First Capital Holdings Corp.</ORGANIZATION> filed for Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection <DATE>last May 30</DATE>. Earlier last <DATE>May</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>First
Capital Life Insurance Co.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Fidelity Bankers Life
Insurance Co.</ORGANIZATION> were seized by insurance regulators in
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION>.

   California to Ban Accounting Practice
   It Says Inflates Insurers' Capital Levels

   California is forcing life insurers in the state to end an
accounting practice that regulators contend artificially
inflates an insurer's capital levels.
   As a result, the new rule will sharply reduce the reported
capital levels of many insurers operating in California. The
change, which hasn't been publicly announced, is the latest
attempt by California regulators to tighten control over
insurers following recent problems involving First Executive
Corp. and First Capital Holdings Corp.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The new rule, outlined in an <DATE>April 15</DATE> letter from <PERSON>John
Garamendi</PERSON>, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> insurance commissioner, to 640
insurance companies licensed to operate in the state, would
ban the use of a controversial reinsurance contract.
Reinsurance companies assume some of the risk on insurer's
policies in return for fees or a share in future revenue.
They also pay commissions for taking the policies, which
insurers list as capital. <PERSON>Norris Clark</PERSON>, chief of financial
analysis, says the department acted after it concluded that
companies had used questionable reinsurance agreements to
boost their capital levels.
   The rule, which takes effect at the end of this year, will
hit California-based companies hardest, but it also could
have an impact on reinsurers and any insurance company
operating in the state. "There are a lot of these
transactions out there," said <PERSON>Mr. Clark</PERSON>. "The early
indications are that it impacts a number of companies. There
are also insurers that have made their business out of
writing these agreements," he said.
   Of the life insurance companies operating in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>,
58 are based in the state. Companies that are based in
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION> would have to eliminate the transactions by <DATE>Dec.
31</DATE>, which would reduce their capital levels. Out-of-state
companies would have to choose between doing business in
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION> and reducing their capital levels for reporting
purposes in the state.
   The accounting change helps explain some of the actions
taken recently regarding the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> insurance unit of
<ORGANIZATION>First Executive</ORGANIZATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION>First Capital Life Insurance Co.</ORGANIZATION>
unit of <ORGANIZATION>First Capital Holdings</ORGANIZATION>. Regulators seized the unit of
<ORGANIZATION>First Executive</ORGANIZATION> after huge junk bond losses. <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>
regulators are expected to sharply restrict the operations of
the <ORGANIZATION>First Capital Holdings</ORGANIZATION> unit in a matter of days.
   People close to the situation say regulators made the
accounting change after examiners discovered several weeks
ago that <MONEY>$64 million</MONEY> of <ORGANIZATION>First Capital Life Insurance</ORGANIZATION>'s <MONEY>$107
million</MONEY> in capital at year end came from questionable
reinsurance agreements. Roughly <MONEY>$165 million</MONEY> of the <MONEY>$474
million</MONEY> in capital at <ORGANIZATION>First Executive</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> unit came
from these transactions, according to people familiar with
the company.
   Insurance companies routinely use reinsurance agreements
to lower their risk of doing business. Many kinds of
reinsurance also have the benefit of boosting capital,
because insurers are able to shift the expense of doing
business to the reinsurer. <PERSON>Mr. Garamendi</PERSON> objects to
reinsurance agreements that serve only to raise an insurer's
capital, without also lowering the risk.
   The department has sent a survey to all 640 companies to
find out how widespread such practices are, <PERSON>Mr. Clark</PERSON> said.
   In the industry, the move "is creating chaos . . .," says
<PERSON>Bruce Winterhof</PERSON>, consulting actuary with <ORGANIZATION>Milliman &amp;
Robertson</ORGANIZATION>, a nationwide actuarial consulting firm. "There are
many insurance companies whose capital would be reduced under
the rule," he says.

   Virginia regulators seized Fidelity Bankers Life Insurance
Co., the second major unit of beleaguered First Capital
Holdings Corp. to be curbed by regulators in less than a
week.
   The action by Virginia's Bureau of Insurance blocks all
policy redemptions and loans but permits routine payments of
death and annuity benefits, as well as accident and health
claims.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   <ORGANIZATION>Fidelity Bankers</ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION>Richmond</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Va.</LOCATION>, had assets of
about <MONEY>$4.07 billion</MONEY> at <DATE>Dec. 31</DATE>, and about 213,000 life
insurance policies and 97,000 annuitants.
   The unit is slightly smaller than <ORGANIZATION>First Capital Life
Insurance Co.</ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>, whose business was sharply
curbed by <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> regulators on <DATE>Friday</DATE>. <ORGANIZATION>First Capital Life</ORGANIZATION>
had assets of <MONEY>$4.46 billion</MONEY> at <DATE>Dec. 31</DATE>, about 190,000
policyholders and 93,000 annuitants. Both companies have
substantial holdings of junk bonds.
   <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION>'s move puts substantially all of <ORGANIZATION>First Capital
Holdings</ORGANIZATION>' insurance business under regulatory restrictions.
Together, <ORGANIZATION>Fidelity Bankers and First Capital Life</ORGANIZATION>, have more
than <MONEY>$31 billion</MONEY> in life insurance benefits owed to
policyholders over the coming decades.
   Although industry watchers had expected <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION>
regulators to swiftly follow <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>'s action, a <ORGANIZATION>Virginia
Bureau of Insurance</ORGANIZATION> spokesman said <DATE>Friday</DATE> that <ORGANIZATION>Fidelity
Bankers</ORGANIZATION> was in "good standing" and that the company met
minimum capital requirements. The spokesman, <PERSON>Kenneth Schrad</PERSON>,
said he didn't know what had occurred between <DATE>Friday</DATE> and
yesterday to change the <ORGANIZATION>Bureau</ORGANIZATION>'s view.
   <ORGANIZATION>Fidelity Bankers</ORGANIZATION> said it was cooperating with <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION>
regulators, adding that it believed the step was in the best
interest of policyholders.
   Much of the business of <ORGANIZATION>First Capital Life</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Fidelity
Bankers</ORGANIZATION> was written through securities dealers, who were
major sellers of annuities written by both companies, opening
the potential for substantial legal liability at various
brokerage companies.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Shearson Lehman Brothers</ORGANIZATION> securities unit of <ORGANIZATION>American
Express Co.</ORGANIZATION>, with a <PERCENT>28%</PERCENT> stake in <ORGANIZATION>First Capital Holdings</ORGANIZATION>,
based in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, sold business that brought in some
<MONEY>$1.74 billion</MONEY> of premiums in the <DATE>last three years</DATE> at the two
companies, according to a <ORGANIZATION>Securities and Exchange Commission</ORGANIZATION>
filing. <ORGANIZATION>PaineWebber Inc.</ORGANIZATION> accounted for business that brought
in <MONEY>$641.9 million</MONEY> over the same period.
   <ORGANIZATION>American Express</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Shearson Lehman</ORGANIZATION> have said they are
continuing talks with <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> insurance regulators. As
previously reported, <ORGANIZATION>American Express</ORGANIZATION> said it will take a
<MONEY>$144 million</MONEY> pretax charge in the current quarter,
representing the <PERCENT>28%</PERCENT> stake. Also there are negative
implications for <ORGANIZATION>Citicorp</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Citibank</ORGANIZATION> unit, leader of a <MONEY>$275
million</MONEY> syndicated loan to <ORGANIZATION>First Capital Holdings</ORGANIZATION>. A
<ORGANIZATION>PaineWebber</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman declined to comment on the company's
sales -- believed to have been written largely with <ORGANIZATION>Fidelity
Bankers</ORGANIZATION>.
   Separately, <ORGANIZATION>Moody's Investors Service Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Standard &amp;
Poor's Corp.</ORGANIZATION> said they downgraded <ORGANIZATION>First Capital Holdings
Corp.</ORGANIZATION>'s subordinated debt.

Additional information attached to the end of this article.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     The state took control of <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION> after a group of lenders headed by
<ORGANIZATION>Citibank</ORGANIZATION> petitioned late <DATE>Monday</DATE> to force its parent, <LOCATION>Los Angeles-based</LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION>First
Capital Holdings Corp.</ORGANIZATION> into bankruptcy for defaulting on a <MONEY>$275 million</MONEY> loan.;
   By placing <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION> into conservatorship, regulators actively run the
company. <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION> will still pay customers death and annuity benefits in
full, along with accident and health claims. But the state is prohibiting
policy redemptions and loans on policies.;    The effect of <PERSON>Garamendi</PERSON>'s action
is to shield the insurance company against claims filed by banks and other
creditors. "We place the insurance company in a protective envelope, if you
will, walling it off from all of its other creditors," <PERSON>Garamendi</PERSON> told a state
Capitol news conference.;    <ORGANIZATION>First Capital Holdings</ORGANIZATION> was a high-flying
insurance operation headed until <DATE>March</DATE> by <PERSON>Robert Weingarten</PERSON>, one of the
industry's highest-paid executives who last year took home <MONEY>$1.35 million</MONEY>. The
company's problems stem largely from investments in risky, high-yield junk
bonds.;    <ORGANIZATION>Shearson Lehman</ORGANIZATION>, an <ORGANIZATION>American Express</ORGANIZATION> subsidiary, owns <PERCENT>28 percent</PERCENT> of
<ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION> and regulators have been pressuring the brokerage firm to
provide more financial support to the insurance units. Negotiations are
continuing on that issue.;    Last week, <PERSON>Garamendi</PERSON> slapped restrictions on
<ORGANIZATION>First Capital Life</ORGANIZATION> after customers flooded the company with requests to cash
in their policies -- a situation analogous to a run on a bank. On <DATE>Monday</DATE>,
<LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> insurance authorities seized its sister unit, <ORGANIZATION>Fidelity Bankers Life
Insurance</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Richmond</LOCATION>, Va.-based insurance firm slightly smaller than <ORGANIZATION>First
Capital Life.;    First Capital</ORGANIZATION> has assets of <MONEY>$4.46 billion</MONEY>, 190,000 life
insurance policyholders and 62,000 annuitants, the state said. <ORGANIZATION>Fidelity
Bankers</ORGANIZATION> has assets of <MONEY>$4.07 billion</MONEY>, 120,000 policyholders and 105,000
annuitants. Both operate in 49 states.;    <PERSON>Garamendi</PERSON> previously said that he
believes <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION> policyholders will receive all of their benefits. At
the news conference, he said that he would not have placed the firm into
conservatorship had the creditors not sought to force it into bankruptcy. He
added that a liquidation of the company is not planned.; IF YOU'RE INTERESTED;
Policyholders can call the state <ORGANIZATION>Department of Insurance</ORGANIZATION> consumer hot line for

   LOS ANGELES -- California insurance commissioner John
Garamendi, seeking to calm skittish bond markets, promised to
avoid "a fire sale" of billions of dollars of junk bonds from
two failed companies now in his department's control.
   "It isn't in anybody's interest to force this market down
by a disorderly liquidation process" of bonds held by
Executive Life Insurance Co. and First Capital Life Insurance
Co., Mr. Garamendi said at a public meeting Friday attended
by about 500 Executive Life policyholders.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The commissioner, who took office in <DATE>January</DATE> and who has
blamed the failure of the two companies on his predecessor,
was greeted with applause and occasional levity during his
one-hour question-and-answer session.
   Junk bond markets sagged early last week after <PERSON>Mr.
Garamendi</PERSON> seized <ORGANIZATION>First Capital Life</ORGANIZATION> and announced that his
officials planned to pare the company's big junk-bond
portfolio. Spooked, some holders of junk bonds began dumping
the securities. Executive Life is a unit of <ORGANIZATION>First Executive
Corp.</ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION> is a unit of <ORGANIZATION>First Capital Holdings
Corp</ORGANIZATION>. Both parent companies are based in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> and,
combined with other insurance units under state control in
<LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION>, hold more than <MONEY>$10 billion</MONEY> face value
of junk bonds.
   Most junk bonds fell 1/2 point <DATE>Friday</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Mr. Garamendi</PERSON>'s problems with jumpy bond markets are but
one of the many complications of a proposed restructuring of
about <MONEY>$10.17 billion</MONEY> in Executive Life assets. The <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>
insurance department has said it will conduct what amounts to
an auction for groups interested in acquiring the failed
company's business.
   The front runner in that auction is a group lead by <ORGANIZATION>Altus
Finance</ORGANIZATION>, a <PERCENT>60%</PERCENT>-owned subsidiary of the French bank <ORGANIZATION>Credit
Lyonnais</ORGANIZATION>, which has committed to provide financing or a
letter of credit for as much as <MONEY>$3 billion</MONEY> in an as-yet
undetermined restructuring. The <ORGANIZATION>Altus Finance</ORGANIZATION> group has been
talking with <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> officials for some months and has
been analyzing a variety of complicated information that
other prospective bidders are only now going to be able to
review.
   Although little has been said publicly about the
prospective look of a "renewed" Executive Life company,
people familiar with the situation say that any restructuring
would consist of a successor company holding the liabilities
to current policyholders, backed by large portions of
Executive Life's present assets and an infusion of new
capital to shore up the company's depleted equity.
   While the assets of the company will need to be shored up,
its liabilities -- what it must pay to policyholders -- must
be reduced. It's expected that, at minimum, interest rates
paid to policy and annuity holders on cash balances will be
sharply reduced.
   <PERSON>Mr. Garamendi</PERSON> said <DATE>Friday</DATE> that he won't require bidders
for Executive Life to sell the company's deeply devalued
holdings of junk bonds, but rather to issue guaranties of a
minimum value for the portfolio. Such a guarantee would
likely be backed by an outside bank or by assets held by the
bidders. He added that his officials were looking for ways in
which policyholders might participate in gains in bond values
in future years.
   However, it's likely that any renewed Executive Life would
have to prune its bulging portfolio of high-yield bonds.
Insurance analysts doubt that policyholders would trust a
company with large holdings of high-yield securities. Also,
state restrictions are expected that will limit junk-bond
holdings to no more than <PERCENT>20%</PERCENT> of assetsfar below the more than
<PERCENT>60%</PERCENT> held by Executive Life. <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> already has a <PERCENT>20%</PERCENT> limit.
   Despite the complications of auctioning Executive Life,
<PERSON>Mr. Garamendi</PERSON> told the policyholders <DATE>Friday</DATE> that it's far
better than the alternative. "Liquidation," he said, "would
be an unmitigated disaster for everybody involved; it would
take forever to liquidate this company {because} there is no
ready market for many of the assets."

   NEW YORK -- American Express thought it got out of the
risky part of the insurance business two years ago when it
sold its last common shares of Fireman's Fund.
   But American Express has found a new way to lose money in
a California insurance company. This time it's First Capital
Holdings, a struggling life insurer of which American Express
once owned 44%, now reduced to 28%. Many Wall Street analysts
think it's unlikely American Express will emerge unscathed
from its association with First Capital, and they have begun
estimating how bad the pain will be.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION> owns the former <PERSON>E.F. Hutton</PERSON> life insurance
company. Customers of <ORGANIZATION>American Express</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Shearson Lehman
Brothers</ORGANIZATION> unit, including many acquired when the firm bought
<PERSON>Hutton</PERSON> in <DATE>1988</DATE>, hold about <MONEY>$2.8 billion</MONEY> of <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION>
policies and annuities.
   Insurance regulators are looking hard at <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION> and
its two insurance units, which invested heavily in junk
bonds, bank loan participations, and commercial real estate.
The <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> insurance commissioner is expected to sharply
restrict the operations of <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>
insurance unit in a matter of days. This week the
commissioner publicly called on <ORGANIZATION>American Express</ORGANIZATION> to pump cash
into the unit, but <ORGANIZATION>American Express</ORGANIZATION> is balking.
   Analysts' estimates of potential charges against <ORGANIZATION>American
Express</ORGANIZATION>'s earnings begin at around <MONEY>$200 million</MONEY> and run as
high as <MONEY>$430 million</MONEY>. While that's manageable for a company
of <ORGANIZATION>American Express</ORGANIZATION>'s size and cash flow, it is likely to
produce a second consecutive quarter of weak earnings and
could force the company to raise more capital, perhaps by
selling common stock.
   The <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION> woes come at a bad time. <ORGANIZATION>American
Express</ORGANIZATION>'s charge-card business is under competitive attack.
First-quarter profit of its charge card and travelers check
unit fell <PERCENT>25%</PERCENT>.
   Analysts are lowering their <DATE>1991</DATE> earnings estimates, and
at least one, <PERSON>Frank DeSantis</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>PaineWebber Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, has
downgraded <ORGANIZATION>American Express</ORGANIZATION> to a rating of "unattractive"
from "neutral."
   The problem, <PERSON>Mr. DeSantis</PERSON> believes, is that write-offs
related to <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION> could wipe out much of <ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION>'s
capital. Because <ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION> needs good credit ratings to
continue its activities in the capital markets, <ORGANIZATION>American
Express</ORGANIZATION> would probably bow to pressure from ratings agencies
to shore up <ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION> with more cash.
   The pain could start with the <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION> stake, still
on <ORGANIZATION>American Express</ORGANIZATION>'s books at <MONEY>$144 million</MONEY> though its market
value is below <MONEY>$20 million</MONEY>. If insurance regulators seize
control of the insurance units, <ORGANIZATION>American Express</ORGANIZATION> will have to
write off its investment, analysts say; they put the profit
impact at <MONEY>20 cents</MONEY> to <MONEY>30 cents</MONEY> a share.
   A tougher question is how much it might also cost <ORGANIZATION>American
Express</ORGANIZATION> to prop up <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> insurance unit,
the seller of nearly all the policies held by <ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION>
customers, or to make up potential losses to <ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION>
clients. Early estimates of those costs run from <MONEY>$50 million</MONEY>
to nearly <MONEY>$300 million</MONEY>. <PERSON>James P. Hanbury</PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION>Wertheim Schroder</ORGANIZATION>
says "no more than <MONEY>$50 million</MONEY> or <MONEY>$100 million</MONEY>." <PERSON>Mr.
DeSantis</PERSON>'s estimate is <MONEY>$280 million</MONEY>, or about <PERCENT>10%</PERCENT> of the
value of the <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION> policies held by <ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION>
customers. (He uses <PERCENT>10%</PERCENT> because the market value of <ORGANIZATION>First
Capital</ORGANIZATION>'s year-end assets was some <PERCENT>10%</PERCENT> below book value.)
   In response to those estimates, a <ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION> spokesman said,
"We are confident that <ORGANIZATION>First Capital Life</ORGANIZATION> currently has the
resources to repay clients at least their original
investments. Shearson now views any guarantees as open-ended
commitments, which it is not in a position to make."
   <PERSON>John Garamendi</PERSON>, the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> insurance commissioner,
won't say how much cash he thinks <ORGANIZATION>American Express</ORGANIZATION> should put
into <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION>. But people familiar with the talks say he
privately asked for <MONEY>$60 million</MONEY>. Several officials involved
in the <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION> rescue talks say <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION>'s
portfolio isn't as junky as that of <ORGANIZATION>First Executive</ORGANIZATION>, another
junk-bond-laden <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> insurance concern whose main unit
<PERSON>Mr. Garamendi</PERSON> seized last month.
   <PERSON>Jack Byrne</PERSON>, a newly elected <ORGANIZATION>American Express</ORGANIZATION> director who
is credited with turning around two troubled insurers, <ORGANIZATION>Geico</ORGANIZATION>
and Fireman's Fund, thinks <PERSON>Mr. Garamendi</PERSON> is taking too hard a
line. "My understanding is that <ORGANIZATION>American Express</ORGANIZATION> made a
number of very reasonable proposals to try to help the
situation," he says, "and I find it hard to understand why
the insurance commissioner has not worked with them a little
more."
   The next few quarters could be rocky for <ORGANIZATION>American Express</ORGANIZATION>,
but fans believe its stock, which closed at <MONEY>$24.75</MONEY>, up <MONEY>50
cents</MONEY>, in <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading
yesterday, will rise along with the economy. "If <ORGANIZATION>American
Express</ORGANIZATION> is successful in defending its franchise and we get a
recovery in the economy and their basic business, then it
could go much higher," says <PERSON>Mr. Hanbury</PERSON>. Adds <PERSON>Allerton
Cushman Jr.</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Morgan Stanley</ORGANIZATION>, who began calling the stock a
buy in mid-March at around 26: "Prospects for the stock
appear to be more clearly linked to a consumer economic
recovery than ever before."

   California insurance commissioner John Garamendi turned up
the heat on American Express Co. to prop up its 28%-owned
First Capital Holdings Corp., saying that "If membership has
its privileges, then ownership has its responsibilities."
   The commissioner has been talking for two weeks with
executives of New York-based American Express and its
Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. securities unit about ways to
rescue the Los Angeles insurer but has made little progress.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   First Capital needs a "substantial infusion of cash" and
"this is Shearson Lehman/American Express's responsibility,"
the commissioner said. "They bought First Capital so that
they would have annuities and life insurance products to sell
through their financial consultants, and sell they did." From
<DATE>1986</DATE> through the <DATE>1991 first quarter</DATE>, more than three-quarters
of the business of <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> insurance unit
was generated by <ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION>.
   Despite <PERSON>Mr. Garamendi</PERSON>'s strong language, <ORGANIZATION>American Express</ORGANIZATION>
didn't budge from its previous position that it is interested
in helping only clients of its <ORGANIZATION>Shearson Lehman Brothers</ORGANIZATION> unit
and not other policyholders of <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION>.
   In <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION> said: "<ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION> has presented the
commissioner with a number of alternatives that have been
developed out of a commitment to protecting the interests of
its clients who are <ORGANIZATION>First Capital Life</ORGANIZATION> policyholders. The
commissioner is looking to develop a more comprehensive
solution. We recognize and respect his position regarding
developments at <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION>. Discussions with the
commissioner are continuing."
   First Capital's woes are likely to hurt <ORGANIZATION>American Express</ORGANIZATION>
financially even if the financial services concern doesn't
bow to <PERSON>Mr. Garamendi</PERSON>'s demand that it pump cash into <ORGANIZATION>First
Capital</ORGANIZATION>.
   At a minimum, analysts say, <ORGANIZATION>American Express</ORGANIZATION> will soon
have to write down the value of its <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION> stake.
<ORGANIZATION>American Express</ORGANIZATION> carries the stake on its books at its
original cost of <MONEY>$144 million</MONEY>, even though <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION>
shares have plunged. At yesterday's closing price, the value
of that stake stood at about <MONEY>$14.6 million</MONEY>.
   The commissioner made his remarks while in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> to
testify before the <ORGANIZATION>Senate Commerce Committee</ORGANIZATION> about another
troubled <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> insurer, <ORGANIZATION>First Executive Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, which
like <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION> has been crippled by large investments in
high-risk, high-yield "junk bonds." <PERSON>Mr. Garamendi</PERSON> seized
<ORGANIZATION>First Executive</ORGANIZATION>'s largest insurance unit last month, the
biggest failure yet of a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> insurer.
   He didn't rule out a similar fate for <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION>, which
has about <MONEY>$8 billion</MONEY> in assets and is roughly half the size
of <ORGANIZATION>First Executive</ORGANIZATION>. "As we pursue our discussions, we will
continue to closely monitor <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION>, and will take any
action necessary to best protect the interests of
policyholders," he said. <PERSON>Mr. Garamendi</PERSON>'s remarks were seen as
unusally strong, particularly given his earlier reluctance to
publicize <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION>'s problems for fear that
policyholders would try to cash in their policies or take out
loans on them, equivalent to a run on a bank.
   A spokesman for <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION> said the level of policy
surrenders "has increased, and it is a matter of concern,"
but added that "it's still at a manageable level."
   If <PERSON>Mr. Garamendi</PERSON> takes control of <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION>'s main
insurance unit or if <ORGANIZATION>American Express</ORGANIZATION> adds cash to <ORGANIZATION>First
Capital</ORGANIZATION> or its insurance unit, then <ORGANIZATION>American Express</ORGANIZATION> will
have to write down the value of its original investment and
deduct that amount from its earnings.
   Such a write-down also will reduce the capital base of the
<ORGANIZATION>Shearson Lehman Brothers</ORGANIZATION> unit, and rating agencies may put
pressure on <ORGANIZATION>American Express</ORGANIZATION> to put more cash into <ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION>,
analysts said. If <ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION> clients incur losses on <ORGANIZATION>First
Capital</ORGANIZATION> policies, <ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION> may face demands to make up the
difference, creating an additional drag on earnings and
capital.
   "The uncertainty that creates may put pressure on the
company to put more capital into <ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION> because of the
rating agencies," said <PERSON>Frank DeSantis</PERSON>, an analyst at
<ORGANIZATION>PaineWebber Inc</ORGANIZATION>.
   If <ORGANIZATION>American Express</ORGANIZATION> pumps cash into <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION> and
takes greater control of the company, <ORGANIZATION>American Express</ORGANIZATION>
wouldn't have to deduct that amount from its earnings. It
will simply be a transfer of capital from <ORGANIZATION>American Express</ORGANIZATION> to
an affiliate.
   The <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION> spokesman conceded <PERSON>Mr. Garamendi</PERSON>'s
remarks were "a very strong public statement" but declined to
speculate on why he made them. He added, "Any negotiations
that would lead to greater capital are certainly helpful."
   <PERSON>Mr. Garamendi</PERSON> is also talking with officials of <ORGANIZATION>Citicorp</ORGANIZATION>,
whose main unit was the lead bank in a <MONEY>$275 million</MONEY> loan to
<ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION> last year.
   <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION>'s stock has fallen steadily since news of
the <PERSON>Garamendi</PERSON> talks was reported <DATE>Monday</DATE>. The stock, which
ended last week at <MONEY>$2.25</MONEY>, plummeted <MONEY>87.5 cents</MONEY> yesterday in
<ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading to <MONEY>$1.125</MONEY>. <ORGANIZATION>American
Express</ORGANIZATION> closed at <MONEY>$25.125</MONEY>, down <MONEY>12.5 cents</MONEY>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Standard &amp; Poor's Corp.</ORGANIZATION> cut its rating on <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION>'s
<MONEY>$120 million</MONEY> of subordinated debt to triple-C-plus from
double-B-minus. Claims-paying ability ratings for <ORGANIZATION>First
Capital Life Insurance Co.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Fidelity Bankers Life
Insurance Co.</ORGANIZATION> fell to double-B from triple-B-plus. The
ratings remain on <ORGANIZATION>S&amp;P</ORGANIZATION>'s CreditWatch, with implications
changed to "negative" from "developing."

FT  13 MAY 91 / International Company News: Shearson faces losses after
Dollars 144m charge for quarter
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
SHEARSON <ORGANIZATION>Lehman Brothers</ORGANIZATION>, the investment banking subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION>American
Express</ORGANIZATION>, is to take a Dollars 144m pre-tax charge against <DATE>second-quarter</DATE>
earnings because of a clampdown last <DATE>Friday</DATE> by <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>'s insurance
regulators on a troubled life company in which <ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION> holds a large stake.
Analysts expect the write-down to push <ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION> into the red, despite the
markets boom which has been boosting Wall Street profits this year. The
brokerage made Dollars 51m in the <DATE>first quarter</DATE>.
The losses will also lower the profits of <ORGANIZATION>American Express</ORGANIZATION>, which faced
severe problems with <ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION> in early <DATE>1990</DATE>, when it was forced to inject
<MONEY>hundreds of millions of dollars</MONEY> into the business following a Dollars 915m
loss.
Mr <PERSON>John Garamendi</PERSON>, the recently appointed Californian insurance
commissioner, issued a 'cease and desist' order on <DATE>Friday</DATE> against <ORGANIZATION>First
Capital Life Insurance</ORGANIZATION>, a San Diego-based company whose parent, <ORGANIZATION>First
Capital Holdings</ORGANIZATION>, is 28 per cent owned by <ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION>.
The previous week <ORGANIZATION>First Capital Life</ORGANIZATION> had faced a flood of customers seeking
to cash in their policies amid reports the company - which has a large
exposure to the junk bond market - faced severe financial problems.
The commissioner's move prevents the company from writing new business or
making payments to its parent, and places a moratorium on policy surrenders
and life insurance policy loans.
The commissioner is seeking longer term solutions to the company's problems,
which could include asset sales and a capital infusion.
Unfounded rumours on <DATE>Friday</DATE> that the company had begun selling off its junk
bond portfolio contributed to a sharp afternoon decline in bond prices and a
sympathetic drop in equity markets, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average
losing 50.98 points on the day.
<ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION>'s write-down covers all its investment in <ORGANIZATION>First Capital Holding</ORGANIZATION>.
However, Wall Street analysts say the brokerage house could face further
losses if it had to compensate those holders of <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION> policies who
brought them through <ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION>.
Shearson, however, says it believes the insurer has 'the resources to meet
at least the principal payments of policyholders' and it is not in a
position to make any open-ended commitments to them. The company has also
been resisting the commissioner's appeals for it to inject fresh money into
<ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION>.

<LEADPARA>  State regulators Friday ordered a $4.5 billion insurance company to stop
writing new policies, saying its overdose on junk bonds has nearly killed it.;
   State Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi's action means San Diego-based
First Capital Insurance Co. will no longer honor requests from customers who
have rushed to cash in $265 million worth of policies.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "The action I have taken is intended to stabilize and begin the process of
rehabilitating the company," <PERSON>Garamendi</PERSON> told a capitol news conference. "It
will give us the necessary time to develop a long-term strategy to return the
company to financial health.";    190,000 policies nationwide;  First Capital
Life, whose most prominent stockholder is <ORGANIZATION>Shearson Lehman Brothers</ORGANIZATION>, has issued
190,000 life insurance policies nationwide.;    But <PERSON>Garamendi</PERSON> said junk bonds
grew from <PERCENT>16 percent</PERCENT> of its investment portfolio in <DATE>1986</DATE> to <PERCENT>46 percent</PERCENT> in
<DATE>1991</DATE>, and it had operating expenses roughly twice the industry's average.;   
"First Capital Life's problems are serious and require immediate attention,"
<PERSON>Garamendi</PERSON> said.;    The state's intervention, which comes about a month after
state regulators seized major portions of junk bond-dependent insurer <ORGANIZATION>First
Executive Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, means <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION> cannot make payments to its parent
company or its affiliates without state approval.;    'The time we need';  The
company issued a three-paragraph statement <DATE>Friday</DATE> in which it said the state's
action will give it "the time we need to stabilize the company's finances and
assure long-term value of our customers' policies.";    "While we regret the
company has reached this point; we believe it was in the best interest of our
policyholders to take this step.";    As news of the company's shaky financial
status spread in recent weeks, <PERSON>Garamendi</PERSON> said, requests to cash in policies
grew from <MONEY>$25 million</MONEY> worth of surrenders on <DATE>Monday</DATE> to <MONEY>$100 million</MONEY> worth
Thursday.;    "That type of increase and amount is an impossible situation for
the company," the insurance commissioner said.;    The state's first elected
insurance chief, noting that the brokerage <ORGANIZATION>Shearson Lehman Brothers</ORGANIZATION> owns <PERCENT>28
percent</PERCENT> of <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION>'s stock and sold <PERCENT>75 percent</PERCENT> of its life insurance
policies from <DATE>1986</DATE> to this year, called on <ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION> to shore up the firm.;   
'Ownership has its responsibilities';  "We would expect that <ORGANIZATION>Shearson Lehman</ORGANIZATION>
will accept the reality that ownership has its responsibilities," said
<PERSON>Garamendi</PERSON>, employing a twist on the slogan of <ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION>'s parent, <ORGANIZATION>American
Express</ORGANIZATION>: "Membership has its privileges.";    The state's action does not
preclude <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION> from honoring other insurance obligations such as death
benefits and annuities.;    <PERSON>Garamendi</PERSON> said "untimely stories in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>
newspapers" that state regulators were negotiating with <ORGANIZATION>American Express</ORGANIZATION> to
assist <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION> hastened the run by policyholders to cash in.;    "We
believe that in general the life insurance industry is a healthy industry,"
<PERSON>Garamendi</PERSON> said when asked if further failures are likely. "It is not in
similar circumstances as the savings and loan industry. It's an industry that
has a very high percentage of the companies operating in a sound and wise
financial manner.";     TROUBLE AT FIRST CAPITAL; After reports of <ORGANIZATION>First
Capital Life Insurance Co.</ORGANIZATION>'s financial plight set off a run of customers
trying to cash in their policies, the <ORGANIZATION>California Department of Insurance</ORGANIZATION>
stepped in <DATE>Friday</DATE> to keep the company afloat.; What's wrong with firm;
(box)<PERCENT>Forty-six percent</PERCENT> of its investments are in non-investment grade
securities -- 'junk bonds,' according to state Insurance Commissioner <PERSON>John
Garamendi.</PERSON>; (box)Operating costs -- twice the industry average -- were
elevated by "unusually high" fees charged by its parent, <ORGANIZATION>First Capital
Holdings</ORGANIZATION>, for asset management and other services, <PERSON>Garamendi</PERSON> said.;
(box)Reports that the firm was in trouble set off a groundswell of requests to

   LOS ANGELES -- Several investor groups are seriously
considering submitting bids to acquire failed First Capital
Life Insurance Co., the California Insurance Department said.
   At least three groups have made "expressions of interest"
through letters of intent, a department spokesman said. He
declined to identify the prospective bidders. Last May, the
department took control of the San Diego company from its
former parent, First Capital Holdings Corp., now in
bankruptcy proceedings. Pacific Mutual Life Insurance Co.,
Newport Beach, Calif., said it is among the parties
considering a possible offer. "We believe that we have the
skills and abilities to play a helpful and constructive role
in this situation," the company said.

another failed company seized by <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> regulators.
   First Capital creditors also "hope to make a bid" for the
company but haven't yet submitted a letter of intent, said a
spokesman for the creditors committee.
   <ORGANIZATION>Shearson Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.</ORGANIZATION> has already put
forward a plan to inject <MONEY>$50 million</MONEY> into <ORGANIZATION>First Capital Life</ORGANIZATION>

confidential <ORGANIZATION>First Capital Life</ORGANIZATION> information, the department

   LOS ANGELES -- Creditors of First Capital Holdings Co. are
bridling at proposals by Citibank and by Shearson Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. to settle claims against First
Capital, which is in bankruptcy proceedings.
   In a federal bankruptcy court filing, the creditor
committee criticized as "purely self-serving" negotiations
between Citibank and Shearson Lehman that have resulted in
plans to reorganize First Capital Holdings and its First
Capital Life Insurance Co. unit.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The committee is asking the court for permission to
propose a competing reorganization plan. A spokesman for
<ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION> said the plan it has proposed "provides the greatest
value to all of {<ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION>'s} policyholders." Officials
of <ORGANIZATION>Citicorp</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Citibank</ORGANIZATION> unit couldn't be reached.
   The current reorganization plans call for a syndicate of
bankers, owed about <MONEY>$260 million</MONEY> and led by <ORGANIZATION>Citibank</ORGANIZATION>, to
receive all of the shares outstanding of <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION>'s two
life insurance units: <ORGANIZATION>First Capital Life</ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>,
and <ORGANIZATION>Fidelity Bankers Life Insurance Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Richmond</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Va.</LOCATION>, which
is operating under the control of <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> regulators. The
plan would leave no distribution for holders of <ORGANIZATION>First Capital
Holdings</ORGANIZATION>' <PERCENT>13%</PERCENT> senior subordinated debentures and other
creditors.
   Separately, <ORGANIZATION>Shearson Lehman</ORGANIZATION> has agreed to lend <MONEY>$50 million</MONEY>
to <ORGANIZATION>First Capital Life</ORGANIZATION> and to guarantee the value of
policyholder accounts at the insurance company, which since
<DATE>last May</DATE> has operated under the control of <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>
regulators in conservatorship proceedings. In return,
<ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION> would have the right to acquire <ORGANIZATION>First Capital Life</ORGANIZATION>
at about <PERCENT>40%</PERCENT> of "fair market value."
   A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION>California Insurance Department</ORGANIZATION> noted
that regulators have called for a full auction process for
<ORGANIZATION>First Capital Life</ORGANIZATION> and that competing bids are welcome.
   <ORGANIZATION>Shearson Lehman</ORGANIZATION>, with a <PERCENT>28%</PERCENT> stake, is <ORGANIZATION>First Capital
Holdings</ORGANIZATION>' largest shareholder. The creditor committee argued
that the proposed restructuring plans would grant an unfair
advantage to the brokerage firm, which is a unit of <ORGANIZATION>American
Express Co</ORGANIZATION>.

   SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- Barely five months into the job,
California's first elected insurance commissioner, John
Garamendi, says he doesn't like the work.
   "It sure hasn't been fun," he told a group of insurance
underwriters recently. "I had no idea that the events and the
task would be so difficult."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Elected with a mandate to roll back auto insurance rates,
<PERSON>Mr. Garamendi</PERSON>, 46 years old, has instead become the warden of
the biggest insurance failures ever. Between them, <ORGANIZATION>Executive
Life Insurance Co.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>First Capital Life Insurance Co.</ORGANIZATION> owe
more than <MONEY>$14 billion</MONEY> to holders of policies and annuities.
The shortfall in assets has yet to be determined.
   <PERSON>Mr. Garamendi</PERSON>'s actions will mean a lot -- not only to
more than half a million policyholders across the nation but
to a life insurance industry undercut by public doubt. Should
he succeed in rehabilitating the failed companies and cutting
auto rates, industry experts say, the darkly handsome and
ambitious <PERSON>Mr. Garamendi</PERSON> will have transformed the obscure
post of state insurance commissioner into a seat of power and
a locus of political change.
   The size of the financial failures, the commissioner's
political skills and <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>'s frequent role as a cradle
of political trends already have brought public recognition
and a potentially pivotal role in an emerging debate over the
direction of insurance regulation. "<PERSON>Mr. Garamendi</PERSON> could
become the prototype for more active insurance commissioners
around the country," says <PERSON>William O'Neill</PERSON>, vice president for
insurance rating services at <ORGANIZATION>Standard &amp; Poor's Corp</ORGANIZATION>.
   In an unusual step, the commissioner will meet today with
hundreds, perhaps thousands, of Executive Life policyholders
at a public gathering in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>. Few if any of his
fellow regulators would attend such a meeting "unless they
were dragged there," says <PERSON>James Long</PERSON>, insurance commissioner
of <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION> and president of the <ORGANIZATION>National Association
of Insurance Commissioners</ORGANIZATION>, the overseer of the nation's
system of state regulation.
   For the moment, <PERSON>Mr. Garamendi</PERSON> has been able to blame the
downfall of Executive Life and of <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION> on his
predecessor, <PERSON>Roxani Gillespie</PERSON>, whose supervision he calls a
case of "Don't worry-be happy." <PERSON>Mr. Garamendi</PERSON> promises a
return of "the hard hand of regulation" to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>'s largest
insurance market. <PERSON>Ms. Gillespie</PERSON> -- who like previous
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION> insurance commissioners and the top regulators in
38 other states was appointed by the governor -- defends her
actions as appropriate.
   <PERSON>Mr. Garamendi</PERSON> came to office in <DATE>January</DATE> under the terms of
Proposition 103, a <DATE>November 1988</DATE> referendum that created the
elected commissionership and mandated sharply lower auto
insurance rates. The rates provision is forcefully opposed by
what the commissioner calls a "gang of 84" insurance
companies, which have taken the matter to court.
   By most standards, <PERSON>Mr. Garamendi</PERSON>, a former state
legislator, college football hero and wrestler, is an oddity
in the world of insurance regulation. He is a <ORGANIZATION>Harvard
Business School</ORGANIZATION> graduate who grew up in a well-heeled family
on a <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> ranch and now owns a pear orchard in <LOCATION>Walnut
Grove</LOCATION>, south of <LOCATION>Sacramento</LOCATION>. He has a populist style, is
comfortable with TV cameras and has a talent for catchy
phrases.
   When <PERSON>Ms. Gillespie</PERSON> approved a rash of rate increases only
days before she left office, <PERSON>Mr. Garamendi</PERSON> blasted it as a
"Christmas present to the fat-cat insurance companies." And
when <ORGANIZATION>American Express Co.</ORGANIZATION>, with a <PERCENT>28%</PERCENT> stake in the parent of
<ORGANIZATION>First Capital Life</ORGANIZATION>, resisted <PERSON>Mr. Garamendi</PERSON>'s private requests
that it add cash to the beleaguered company, he publicly
charged <ORGANIZATION>American Express</ORGANIZATION> and its <ORGANIZATION>Shearson Lehman Brothers</ORGANIZATION>
investment unit with unseemly abandonment. "If membership has
its privileges, then ownership has its responsibilities," he
declared. <ORGANIZATION>American Express</ORGANIZATION> has said it will take appropriate
actions but hasn't accepted any obligation to recapitalize
the ailing company.
   His willingness to shoot from the lip has raised eyebrows
in the insurance business, where many worry that <PERSON>Mr.
Garamendi</PERSON>'s stewardship of Executive Life, a <LOCATION>Los
Angeles-based</LOCATION> unit of <ORGANIZATION>First Executive Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, and of <ORGANIZATION>First
Capital Life</ORGANIZATION>, a San Diego-based unit of <ORGANIZATION>First Capital
Holdings Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, could be marred by rash actions. There also
is concern that the commissioner has created an unrealistic
wave of hope with his plans to resuscitate what appear to be
badly damaged companies.
   There has been one major slip. <PERSON>Mr. Garamendi</PERSON> announced his
conservatorship of Executive Life in optimistic tones, saying
that policy redemptions and loans would be blocked but that
routine death-benefit and annuity checks would continue at
<MONEY>100 cents</MONEY> on the dollar. But for nearly two weeks, claimants
were left hanging by a glitch in an <ORGANIZATION>Insurance Department</ORGANIZATION>
order. While death benefits are now being paid at <MONEY>100 cents</MONEY>
on the dollar, annuity payments are being made at <MONEY>70 cents</MONEY>.
The misstep irked regulators in many states.
   <PERSON>Mr. Garamendi</PERSON> has been guarded about a point of vital
interest to state regulators: the debate over what role, if
any, the federal government should play in the patchwork of
state insurance regulation. Though some industry and
regulatory people say the commissioner of the nation's most
populous state might break ranks and support federal
oversight, <PERSON>Mr. Garamendi</PERSON> says he wants to give state
regulation more time. But he suggests that more large
failures would change his mind. "The schedule is driven by
events," he says.
   Many who know him say <PERSON>Mr. Garamendi</PERSON> himself is driven. For
more than 15 years he was a state legislator, concentrating
on ecological and economic issues. "He was never a superstar
in the state <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> but was always extremely ambitious," says
<PERSON>Dick Rosengarten</PERSON>, publisher of <ORGANIZATION>Calfornia Political Week</ORGANIZATION>, a
newsletter.
   In <DATE>1982</DATE>, <PERSON>Mr. Garamendi</PERSON>, then 37, ran in the Democratic
primary for governor and lost. Soon afterward, he tried to
unseat the president pro tem of the state <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>. "It was the
shortest-lived coup in history -- less than 36 hours," <PERSON>Mr.
Garamendi</PERSON> says of his defeat. He also lost a bid for the
nomination for state controller.
   But as commissioner, <PERSON>Mr. Garamendi</PERSON> has found the high
profile he has sought.
   "At the moment he's the most visible politician in
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION>," says <PERSON>Clinton Reilly</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> political
consultant who has advised <PERSON>Mr. Garamendi</PERSON>.

   Creditors of First Capital Holdings Corp., Los Angeles,
which filed for bankruptcy protection last summer, said they
plan to ask the court overseeing the proceedings for
permission to file suit against Shearson Lehman Brothers, a

   The creditors said they are taking the action because they
don't believe they will receive a favorable settlement in the
bankruptcy proceedings. The expected filing in the Los
Angeles court today would follow two similar suits by
investors who charged that Shearson misled them about the
holding company's problems.

   Mutual Benefit Resorts to Restructuring
   After Talks With Metropolitan Life Fail

   Mutual Benefit Life Insurance Co., the nation's
18th-largest life insurer, plans to sell off part of its
operations to boost its sagging capital.
   The Newark, N.J.-based company, hurt by sour real-estate
loans and investments, is readying the restructuring plan
after it held unsuccessful talks to receive a major infusion
of cash from Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. At one time, the
talks, which ended earlier this week, included a possible
merger between Met Life, the second-largest life insurer, and
Mutual Benefit, which has $13.5 billion in assets and 4.5
million policyholders. Met Life rejected both proposals.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   It is unclear how much capital Mutual Benefit is seeking.
Under the current restructuring, <ORGANIZATION>Mutual Benefit</ORGANIZATION> would sell
part of its group health business and withdraw from some
individual life insurance businesses, said <PERSON>Henry Kates</PERSON>,
president.
   Mutual Benefit is the latest life insurer to seek outside
capital because of losses in its real-estate investment
portfolio. <ORGANIZATION>Equitable Life Assurance Society</ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION>United
States</LOCATION>'s board yesterday reviewed proposals from investors
for as much as <MONEY>$1 billion</MONEY> in new capital.
   <ORGANIZATION>USF&amp;G Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, which also has had large real-estate losses,
said this week it wants to raise <MONEY>$300 million</MONEY>. Earlier this
month, regulators seized the main insurance units of <ORGANIZATION>First
Executive Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>First Capital Holdings Co.</ORGANIZATION> because of
junk-bond woes.
   The talks between <ORGANIZATION>Mutual Benefit Life</ORGANIZATION> and Metropolitan
centered on arrangements to conserve Mutual Benefit's capital
base, including a <MONEY>$100 million</MONEY> capital infusion as one
possibility, <PERSON>Mr. Kates</PERSON> said.
   All of the options would have brought relief for Mutual
Benefit, whose real-estate investment losses have helped
reduce total capital to <MONEY>$561 million</MONEY> at year end from <MONEY>$576
million</MONEY> a year earlier, according to figures from <ORGANIZATION>Townsend &amp;
Schupp</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION> insurance consulting firm. The
portfolio includes more than <MONEY>$200 million</MONEY> invested in <LOCATION>Fisher
Island</LOCATION>, an exclusive resort in <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>.
   As a result, the company's capital as a percentage of
invested assets is well below the industry norm. And its low
capital and heavy concentration could lead to a downgrading
by rating agencies before it can implement its plan, which
<PERSON>Mr. Kates</PERSON> said hasn't been cleared by regulators.
   <PERSON>Mr. Kates</PERSON> stressed that the company isn't in any immediate
danger and doesn't have a pressing need for capital. Indeed,
a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION>New Jersey Insurance Department</ORGANIZATION> said
regulators there hadn't taken any action against the insurer
but added that a routine examination of the company is under
way.
   Details of the restructuring plan are sketchy. Generally
it calls for transforming its individual life insurance
business into an agency business, with <ORGANIZATION>Mutual Benefit</ORGANIZATION> selling
the policies of other life insurers. It would still sell some
forms of life insurance, such as term insurance.
   The company then would concentrate on its group life
insurance business, which it would sell through a stock-owned
subsidiary of Mutual Benefit. Mutual Benefit, as a mutual
insurance company is owned by its policyholders. To raise
capital for the stock-owned unit, the company probably would
eventually sell stock either through a private placement or a
public offering, <PERSON>Mr. Kates</PERSON> said.
   The termination of talks with Met Life could result in a
downgrading of Mutual Benefit by <ORGANIZATION>Standard &amp; Poor's Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and
<ORGANIZATION>Moody's Investors Service Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, which currently assign
double-A-plus and double-A-3 ratings respectively to the
company. <PERSON>Mr. Kates</PERSON> said both agencies are now evaluating the
situation. Insurance companies depend on high ratings to
maintain policyholder confidence and to retain top-producing
agents.
   Mutual Benefit has one of the largest real-estate
portfolios as a percentage of its assets among the large
insurance companies. At the end of the year, it had
foreclosed on more than <PERCENT>50%</PERCENT>, or <MONEY>$226 million</MONEY>, of its
real-estate investments. Its nonperforming mortgage loans
climbed to <MONEY>$247 million</MONEY> from <MONEY>$112 million</MONEY> at the <DATE>end of 1989</DATE>.
Its total mortgage portfolio stood at <MONEY>$4.7 billion</MONEY>, according
to <ORGANIZATION>Townsend &amp; Schupp</ORGANIZATION>.
   As a result of its investment problems, unrealized capital
losses totaled <MONEY>$215 million</MONEY> at year end. Total capital, which
includes reserves for investments, fell to <MONEY>$561 million</MONEY> from
<MONEY>$576 million</MONEY> in <DATE>1989</DATE>.
   Some analysts say much of the company's capital base was
generated through so-called surplus relief reinsurance, which
has come under fire recently by <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> Insurance
Commissioner <PERSON>John Garamendi</PERSON>. <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> regulators recently
charged that some kinds of surplus relief reinsurance pacts
artificially inflate capital.
   At the end of <DATE>last year</DATE>, Mutual Benefit arranged surplus
relief reinsurance agreements on life insurance involving
over <MONEY>$1 billion</MONEY> in premiums, according to <PERSON>John Kleiman</PERSON>, an
analyst with <LOCATION>Hartford</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Connecticut-based Conning &amp; Co</ORGANIZATION>. It is
unclear whether those agreements are the same type that <PERSON>Mr.
Garamendi</PERSON> has questioned.
   <PERSON>Mr. Kates</PERSON>, who called the transactions routine, said the
agreements generated <MONEY>$40 million</MONEY> in surplus. Without the
transactions, its total capital would have dipped to <MONEY>$521
million</MONEY>. "It certainly looks like a rush to shore up the
balance sheet at the end of the year," <PERSON>Mr. Kleiman</PERSON> said.

   <ORGANIZATION>First Capital Holdings Corp.</ORGANIZATION>'s plan to acquire the major insurance unit of <ORGANIZATION>E.F. Hutton Group Inc.</ORGANIZATION> for <MONEY>$300 million</MONEY> is being delayed, apparently because of questions raised by state insurance regulators. 

   <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION>, a holding company with life insurance and mutual-fund management units, previously told securities analysts and investors that it hoped to complete the acquisition of <ORGANIZATION>E.F. Hutton Insurance Group</ORGANIZATION> by the end of <DATE>last month</DATE>. 

   Yesterday, <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION> issued a statement saying it is "in continuing discussions with the <ORGANIZATION>California Insurance Department</ORGANIZATION> concerning the structure of its pending acquisition . . . and will grant the department a further extension of time to consider its application." 

   Officials of <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION> declined to elaborate on the statement except to say that the extension is for "a very limited" amount of time that the company wouldn't specify. 

   <PERSON>Roxani Gillespie</PERSON>, the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> insurance commissioner, said in an interview that the insurance department has asked for more information from <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION> about the <PERSON>Hutton</PERSON> acquisition. 
She declined to specify the department's major areas of concern about the transaction. 
Asked if she expects the acquisition to be completed, she said that "it will all depend" on the information provided. 

   The acquisition can't be completed without the department's approval. 
The <PERSON>Hutton</PERSON> insurance unit is based in <LOCATION>La Jolla</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, and is regulated by the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> department. 

   <PERSON>Thomas G. Richter</PERSON>, an insurance analyst with <ORGANIZATION>Robinson-Humphrey Co.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION> officials told him that the insurance department was concerned about the amount of debt that <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION> intends to incur to finance the acquisition. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Richter</PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION> officials "still feel that the deal is intact." 
However, he said <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION> may change its planned securities offering to include more preferred stock and less debt. 

   In <DATE>March</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION> filed registration statements with the <ORGANIZATION>Securities and Exchange Commission</ORGANIZATION> covering issues of <MONEY>$150 million</MONEY> of senior subordinated notes, <MONEY>$50 million</MONEY> of convertible debentures and <MONEY>$50 million</MONEY> of cumulative convertible preferred stock, all via <ORGANIZATION>Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc</ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION> also has said it plans to borrow <MONEY>$200 million</MONEY> from banks to help finance the <PERSON>Hutton</PERSON> insurance acquisition. 

   First Capital and <ORGANIZATION>Drexel</ORGANIZATION> were scheduled to hold meetings to explain the securities offering to potential investors in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> starting today, but the meetings were canceled yesterday. 

   <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION> shares fell <MONEY>$1</MONEY> to close at <MONEY>$15.50</MONEY> in <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading yesterday. 

   In a prospectus for the securities offering, <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION> said it would have <MONEY>$113 million</MONEY> in equity and <MONEY>$456 million</MONEY> in debt after the offering, <PERSON>Mr. Richter</PERSON> said. 
He noted that the indicated debt to equity ratio of about 4-to-1 was far greater than that of most life insurers, which typically have little or no debt. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Richter</PERSON> also noted that <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION> said in its prospectus that some of the proceeds of the offering would be used to pay interest on its debt. 

   Some investors have questioned <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION>'s method of accounting for certain life insurance products. 
The company books about <PERCENT>17%</PERCENT> of the expected future profits from certain policies in the year the policies are sold, rather than waiting until it earns the profits over several years, <PERSON>Mr. Richter</PERSON> said. 

   The acquisition of <ORGANIZATION>Hutton</ORGANIZATION>'s insurance unit would add about <MONEY>$2.7 billion</MONEY> in assets to <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION>, which had total assets of <MONEY>$816 million</MONEY> at <DATE>March 31</DATE>. 
First Capital's major units currently are <ORGANIZATION>Fidelity Bankers Life Insurance Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Richmond</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Va.</LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION>Pilgrim Group Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, which runs a group of mutual funds.

   LOS ANGELES -- California regulators unveiled an
intricate, two-part plan to restructure Executive Life
Insurance Co. that would offer difficult choices to
policyholders and clearly signaled for the first time that
they and other creditors could suffer substantial initial
losses.
   The proposed resolution of the nation's largest insurance
failure -- termed a "rehabilitation blueprint" by California
Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi -- is only a suggested
structure for prospective bidders for the insolvent insurer,
a unit of Los Angeles-based First Executive Corp. until it
was seized April 11 by state insurance regulators.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   It isn't clear what the complicated blueprint could
produce for the nearly 170,000 life insurance policyholders,
75,000 individual annuitants and members of retirement and
other plans covered by 307 guaranteed investment contracts.
The results will depend in large part on the bids offered by
investor groups. But, by one estimate, holders who choose to
keep their policies with a successor company to Executive
Life might initially have policies worth <PERCENT>70%</PERCENT> or so of the
value assigned them by Executive Life. More could be
recovered over time, depending on a recovery in the junk bond
market and final recovery from state guarantee funds and
legal settlements.
   Holders of certain municipal securities backed by
Executive Life are likely to get <MONEY>30 cents</MONEY> or less on the
dollar under the plan, the insurance department said.
   <PERSON>Mr. Garamendi</PERSON>, who has promised maximum recoveries for
policyholders and annuitants, warned that his proposal is
dependent on a reversal of a <MONEY>$643 million</MONEY> claim by the
<ORGANIZATION>Internal Revenue Service</ORGANIZATION> for back taxes. <PERSON>Mr. Garamendi</PERSON>,
together with his <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> counterpart, <PERSON>Salvatore Curiale</PERSON>,
will appear today before a congressional committee looking
into the Executive Life collapse.
   The plan announced yesterday makes no provision for a
second <ORGANIZATION>First Executive unit-Executive Life Insurance Co.</ORGANIZATION> of
<LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, which was seized by regulators in that state.
Regulators have in the past suggested that a resolution might
be cast for the two companies, whose combined assets before
their failure totaled more than <MONEY>$13 billion</MONEY>.
   Under the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> plan, two entities would replace
Executive Life. The first, a successor company, would take
title to most of the former insurance company's assets and
all its liabilities. A second entity, a liquidating trust,
would be established to recoup money from state insurance
guarantee funds around the country, from litigation and from
various Executive Life investment assets that are considered
high-risk securities.
   <PERSON>Mr. Garamendi</PERSON> signaled that bidders for Executive Life's
business will be expected to inject at least <MONEY>$300 million</MONEY> to
<MONEY>$500 million</MONEY> in cash in the successor company to recapitalize
it. And billions of dollars of guarantees will be required to
shore up Executive Life's junk bond-laden portfolio. <PERSON>Mr.
Garamendi</PERSON> has said he prefers the guarantee approach -- in
which buyers would promise to put in extra money if the bonds
fall below a certain level -- to a "fire sale" that would
depress junk bond markets.
   The <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> commissioner left open the required amount
of guarantees. However, <ORGANIZATION>Altus Finance</ORGANIZATION>, a <PERCENT>60%</PERCENT>-owned subsidiary
of the French bank <ORGANIZATION>Credit Lyonnais</ORGANIZATION>, is leading an investor
group that has said it will put up <MONEY>$3 billion</MONEY> or more in cash
and guarantees.
   People familiar with the bidding process say there are
three other interested parties in addition to <ORGANIZATION>Altus Finance</ORGANIZATION>,
which is the only publicly declared bidder. Under the bidding
process, qualified interested parties will have several weeks
to inspect internal Executive Life accounts and then to file
a bid. Any settlement will eventually have to be approved by
a state court in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> that is overseeing the
conservatorship process.
   Policy and annuity holders will face some particularly
hard choices if the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> plan proceeds. At the creation
of the successor company, they will have the option of
cashing out their policies at amounts that may be much less
than <MONEY>50 cents</MONEY> on the dollar. Or, they may agree to turn over
their policies to the successor company, where they would be
locked in for a minimum period -- probably three to five
years.
   <PERSON>Mr. Garamendi</PERSON>'s plan appears to be bad news for holders of
about <MONEY>$1.7 billion</MONEY> (face amount) of municipal bonds that are,
through a complicated structure, backed by guaranteed
investment contracts issued by Executive Life. These
contracts -- which aren't technically insurance -- are deemed
to be secondary and the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> department said they are
expected to have a restructured value of about <PERCENT>30%</PERCENT> of the
value of "higher priority assets," which could mean a value
of less than <MONEY>30 cents</MONEY> on the dollar.
   <PERSON>Albert M. Schlueter</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>St. Louis</LOCATION> attorney for a group of
institutions that bought GIC-backed bonds, expressed surprise
at the <PERSON>Garamendi</PERSON> plan. "There isn't any reason the GICs
should be treated any differently from an insurance contract
or an annuity," he said. GICs "wouldn't be marketable if a
purchaser knows he is immediately in an inferior position."
   Most other policies and annuities will be considered to
have equal priority in the restructuring process, the
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION> insurance department said, including guaranteed
investment contracts issued to various pension funds around
the country.

   CHICAGO -- An investor in insurance products issued by
First Capital Life Insurance Co. sued Shearson Lehman
Brothers Inc. in state court here, alleging that the

First Capital products.
   New York-based Shearson, a unit of American Express Co.,
holds a 28% stake in Los Angeles-based First Capital Life.

   First Capital's substantial junk-bond holdings have lost

   Shearson took a <MONEY>$141 million</MONEY> charge to write off its <ORGANIZATION>First

   <PERSON>Bernard Giermak</PERSON>, who says he paid <MONEY>$100,000</MONEY> in <DATE>1988</DATE> for a
single-premium deferred annuity issued by <ORGANIZATION>First Capital Life</ORGANIZATION>,
filed the suit in <ORGANIZATION>Cook County Circuit Court</ORGANIZATION>. The complaint
seeks class-action status on behalf of all buyers of
financial products issued by <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION> that were marketed
by <ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION>.
   The complaint alleges that, even though <ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION> knew that
<ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION> held a significant portion of "high-yield and
risky junk bonds," its agents wrongfully "made
representations to the public that <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION>'s products
were safe investments." It also contends that <ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION> failed
to instruct agents to disclose "the material fact that
<ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION> had a substantial ownership interest in First
Capital." The suit seeks unspecified damages.
   Shearson officials couldn't be reached for comment.

<LEADPARA>  In a surprise move that jeopardizes life insurance and annuity payments to

insurance regulators said Monday.;    State Insurance Commissioner John

<HEADLINE>  IRS DEMANDS $643 MILLION FROM EXEC LIFE  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Mercury News Staff Writer Cris Oppenheimer-Pitthan contributed to this report.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     "This would wipe out whatever capital the company has," <PERSON>Garamendi</PERSON> said. "If
this company is liquidated, the pain will be enormous for policyholders,
annuitants and the whole life insurance industry.";    In a bit of good news,
<PERSON>Garamendi</PERSON> said the insurance department received court permission <DATE>Monday</DATE> to
resume payments on death benefits and annuities.;    The court order issued
<DATE>Monday</DATE> by the <ORGANIZATION>Los Angeles Superior Court</ORGANIZATION> allows Executive First -- under the
state's conservatorship -- to resume paying <PERCENT>100 percent</PERCENT> of death benefits and
<PERCENT>70 percent</PERCENT> of retirement annuities to beneficiaries and policyholders. Annuity
holders, except those under guaranteed investment contracts, would receive
their current payments.;    If the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> is successful in forcing its claims,
however, all payments may stop, <PERSON>Garamendi</PERSON> said.;    Executive Life, the
primary operating subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION>First Executive Corp.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, was
seized by <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> regulators on <DATE>April 11</DATE> after defaults in its huge
portfolio of high-yield "junk bonds" left it in financially hazardous
condition and sent customers rushing to cash in policies.;    Last week,
regulators in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> seized the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> subsidiary for the same reasons.;  
 The actions amounted to the largest failure yet of an insurance company.;   
Californians hold about 34,000 Executive Life insurance policies with a face
value of <MONEY>$9.5 billion</MONEY> and 16,500 annuities valued at <MONEY>$725 million</MONEY>. Overall,
Executive has 170,000 life insurance policies worth <MONEY>$38 billion</MONEY> and 75,000
annuity contracts worth <MONEY>$2.5 billion</MONEY> in force in 46 states.;     Claims by the
<ORGANIZATION>Internal Revenue Service</ORGANIZATION> would take precedence over claims of policyholders
and all other creditors of the company, industry experts said.;    If the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION>
is successful in laying claim to the bulk of Executive Life's cash, <PERSON>Garamendi</PERSON>
said policyholders would need to look to state guarantee funds to pay their
claims. Each guarantee fund has separate limits on coverage.;    <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>'s
fund covers up to <PERCENT>80 percent</PERCENT> of the policy amount to a maximum of <MONEY>$100,000</MONEY> on
annuities and <MONEY>$250,000</MONEY> on death benefits. Less traditional products, such as
guaranteed investment contracts, are not covered at all.;    Moreover,
<PERSON>Garamendi</PERSON> noted that a previously announced rehabilitation plan, which
anticipated that the French company <ORGANIZATION>Altus Financial</ORGANIZATION> would buy Executive Life,
is also now in question because of the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> claim.;    "Altus' proposal, and
the proposals we have received from other companies, do not include anything
for this tax liability," <PERSON>Garamendi</PERSON> said.;    <ORGANIZATION>The IRS</ORGANIZATION> claim is based on audits
of Executive Life's <DATE>1981</DATE>, <DATE>1982</DATE> and <DATE>1983</DATE> tax years, according to regulators.
Although state <ORGANIZATION>Insurance Department</ORGANIZATION> officials knew that the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> was reviewing
Executive Life's books regarding these years, until late last <DATE>Friday</DATE> the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION>
had refused to disclose the scope of their claim.;    But in a letter faxed
<DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME> to Executive Life, the federal agency said it is owed <MONEY>$643.4
million</MONEY> -- or roughly <MONEY>$249 million</MONEY> in taxes and <MONEY>$394 million</MONEY> in interest and
penalties. And it wants to be paid immediately.;    "It was not a coincidence
that the state takeover and our filing a lien on the insurer came within a few
days of each other," said <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON>Jan Gribbon</PERSON>. "The law says that in
this kind of situation, a conservatorship, we must take action before the
assets are depleted."  </TEXT>

   California insurance regulators took over Western Pacific
Life Insurance Co., a little more than a week after Florida
regulators seized its parent company, which is now under
criminal investigation in Florida.
   The California order of conservatorship, granted by a
state court in Los Angeles last Tuesday, was sought because
of Western Pacific's financial instability resulting from a
portfolio of high-risk, high-yield bonds and the insolvency
of the parent, Guarantee Security Life Insurance Co., the
California insurance department said in announcing the
takeover on Friday.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The department declared a moratorium on <ORGANIZATION>Western Pacific
Life</ORGANIZATION> policy surrenders and loans, but said that full death
and annuity payments will continue.
   Western Pacific was found to be in "hazardous" condition
because of concerns about its junk-bond portfolio, the
insolvency of its parent company and the potential of an
increase in policy surrenders that could lead to a "run," the
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION> department said. At <DATE>Dec. 31</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Western Pacific</ORGANIZATION> had
assets of <MONEY>$46.7 million</MONEY>, of which <PERCENT>40%</PERCENT> were invested in junk
bonds, the department said.
   Guarantee Security Life, <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>'s sixth-largest life
insurance company, was seized by state regulators on <DATE>Aug. 12</DATE>
after the company admitted insolvency because of losses in
its junk-bond holdings. Executive offices of both <ORGANIZATION>Guarantee
Security Life and Western Pacific Life</ORGANIZATION> are in <LOCATION>Jacksonville</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Fla.</LOCATION>, although <ORGANIZATION>Western Pacific Life</ORGANIZATION> is technically
headquartered in downtown <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Paul Kiernan</PERSON>, vice president of marketing for both
companies, declined to comment directly on the regulators'
actions but said that "at the operating company level, we
didn't have any role in the management of the assets."
   Guarantee Security Life is a unit of <ORGANIZATION>Transmark USA Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a
holding firm owned or controlled by <PERSON>Mark Sanford</PERSON>, <PERSON>Mr. Kiernan</PERSON>
said. <PERSON>Mr. Sanford</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Jacksonville</LOCATION> resident, couldn't be
reached for comment.
   <PERSON>Tom Gallagher</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> treasurer and insurance
commissioner, recently disclosed that <ORGANIZATION>Guarantee Security Life</ORGANIZATION>
is the subject of a criminal investigation as to whether it
"relied on possibly illegal arrangements with stockbrokers
and accountants."
   On <DATE>Friday</DATE>, a <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> insurance department spokeswoman
said: "We have reason to believe that there is more to this
insolvency than just junk-bond investments. {But} the law
enforcement agencies that are investigating {violations} of
civil and criminal laws have asked us not to discuss this in
any way."
   At <DATE>June 30</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Western Pacific Life</ORGANIZATION> had 317 life insurance
policyholders and 3,717 annuitants, the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> department
said. Guarantee Security Life had 51,739 annuities in force
with a net cash value of <MONEY>$410.4 million</MONEY> and 5,963
single-premium whole life insurance policies with a net cash
value of <MONEY>$134.7 million</MONEY>, the <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> department said. At one
time, as much as <PERCENT>90%</PERCENT> of the company's assets were invested in
junk bonds, it said.
   Since <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>'s first elected insurance commissioner,
<PERSON>John Garamendi</PERSON>, assumed office in <DATE>January</DATE>, he has put 16
insurance companies into receivership. The largest and most
visible was <ORGANIZATION>Executive Life Insurance Co.</ORGANIZATION>, a junk-bond-laden
insurer that was seized in <DATE>April</DATE>. By contrast, <PERSON>Mr.
Garamendi</PERSON>'s predecessor took control of seven companies in
<DATE>1990</DATE> and 12 in <DATE>1989</DATE>.

   LOS ANGELES -- First Executive Corp., whose two main
insurance subsidiaries were seized by regulators last month,
filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the
federal Bankruptcy Code.
   The insurance holding company's bankruptcy petition had
been widely expected since insurance departments in
California and New York took control respectively of
Executive Life Insurance Co. and Executive Life of New York.
In a bit of a surprise, the parent is seeking to reorganize
rather than liquidate.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Separately, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> Insurance Commissioner <PERSON>John
Garamendi</PERSON> disclosed plans to auction Executive Life
Insurance, adding that a group headed by <ORGANIZATION>Altus Finance</ORGANIZATION> -- a
<PERCENT>60%</PERCENT>-owned subsidiary of the French bank Credit Lyonnais --
has committed to provide as much as <MONEY>$3 billion</MONEY> to rebuild the
company. Altus has been talked about for some time as a
prospective buyer of Executive Life's business.
   First Executive disclosed its bankruptcy petition in a
one-paragraph statement issued <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> after the filing
in federal bankruptcy court here. Chief Financial Officer
<PERSON>William L. Sanders</PERSON>, who signed the petition, said company
attorneys had advised him not to elaborate.
   In its heyday in the mid-1980s, <ORGANIZATION>First Executive</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Fred
Carr</PERSON>, the company's chairman, were a key part of <PERSON>Michael
Milken</PERSON>'s junk-bond network. When the junk market foundered,
<ORGANIZATION>First Executive</ORGANIZATION>'s foundations began to crumble.
   Spokesmen for the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> insurance
departments said the bankruptcy petition wouldn't affect the
more than 400,000 Americans who put substantial assets -- in
some cases their life savings -- into the two insurance
companies now under regulators' control.
   Death benefits, annuity payments and other claims continue
to be paid without interruption by the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> subsidiary,
said <PERSON>Kevin Foley</PERSON>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>'s deputy superintendent. In
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, after a temporary halt last month, payments have
resumed to Executive Life policyholders. The <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>
insurer is paying <PERCENT>100%</PERCENT> of all death and health claims and <PERCENT>70%</PERCENT>
of annuity payments, said a spokesman.
   According to the filing, <ORGANIZATION>First Executive</ORGANIZATION> has liabilities
of about <MONEY>$280 million</MONEY>, not including contingent or
unliquidated claims. The figure for total assets, <MONEY>$804
million</MONEY>, is an almost meaningless number because
substantially all of the parent's assets are its investments
in various subsidiaries, including the two seized units.
   Most of the debt is owed to foreign banks, including
<ORGANIZATION>Yasuda Trust &amp; Banking Co.</ORGANIZATION>, the filing shows. First Executive
has several series of preferred shares and more than 6,000
holders of its 85.3 million common shares. In recent months,
the common shares have traded over the counter for a few
pennies apiece.
   The filing doesn't cover any of about 30 <ORGANIZATION>First Executive</ORGANIZATION>
subsidiaries. "There are still some smaller insurance
subsidiaries that appear to be relatively healthy and have
significantly more value as going concerns than they would if
they were liquidated," said <PERSON>Bruce Spector</PERSON>, an attorney at
<ORGANIZATION>Stutman, Treister &amp; Glatt</ORGANIZATION>, lead bankruptcy counsel.
   The contingent claims mentioned in the filing refer mainly
to annuities issued by Executive Life and possibly other
parent company units in connection with so-called structured
settlements, said a person close to <ORGANIZATION>First Executive</ORGANIZATION>. Many of
those settlements were guaranteed by the parent company.
   Structured settlements enable accident and other victims
to receive compensation payments over time rather than in a
lump sum. First Executive's role as a guarantor was part of
intricate tax-driven arrangements that allow defendants to
remove themselves from liability for all future payments.
   <ORGANIZATION>California Insurance Commissioner Garamendi</ORGANIZATION>'s plan seems
designed to put pressure on would-be bidders for the remains
of the failed company. The auction process calls for
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION> regulators to continue negotiations with the <ORGANIZATION>Altus
Finance</ORGANIZATION> group while at the same time opening up internal
information on Executive Life to other qualified bidders. <PERSON>Mr.
Garamendi</PERSON> said in an interview that there are three other
groups whom he said "have expressed interest, appear to meet
the qualifications, and want to get into the process."
   He said the auction process won't necessarily apply to
<ORGANIZATION>First Executive</ORGANIZATION>'s smaller <ORGANIZATION>Executive Life Insurance Co.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>New
York</LOCATION> unit. While inclusion of the unit will be discussed, it
"may or may not be included in any deal," he said.
   <PERSON>Mr. Garamendi</PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION>Altus Finance</ORGANIZATION> group includes
several other French concerns, including the giant insurer
<ORGANIZATION>Cie. de Navigation Mixte</ORGANIZATION>, and several lesser-known financial
concerns, <ORGANIZATION>Euris S.A.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Eurofinac S.A.</ORGANIZATION>, and Cie. Financier
<PERSON>Alain Mallart</PERSON>.
   Would-be rescuers will likely suggest that a new company
be built from Executive Life's assets and liabilities. In
almost any case, it's expected that policyholders and other
claimants of the company will have to give up <MONEY>hundreds of
millions of dollars</MONEY> -- perhaps more -- in future payouts,
mostly through lower interest rates that would be applied to
policies. This so-called restructuring of liabilities would
likely be accompanied by a removal of some of Executive
Life's junk bonds and perhaps guarantee of others.

<LEADPARA>  In April, the insurance empire created by Fred Carr, a soft-spoken,
white-haired super-salesman, crumbled. First Executive Corp. filed for
bankruptcy and its two big insurance subsidiaries were seized by state
watchdogs.;   But the regulators' actions were too little, too late. In fact,
today some critics charge that the laxity of state regulators, particularly in
California, contributed to the collapse of Executive Life Insurance Co. in
California and Executive Life Insurance Co. of New York.  </LEADPARA>

SYSTEM FAILED IN 1ST EXEC CASE  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>     Indeed, four years ago <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> regulators realized that <PERSON>Carr</PERSON> and his
associates were overstating Executive Life's financial health and demanded
that the company raise more cash as a cushion against losses. And in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>,
officials -- incensed by regulatory violations, fudged financial statements
and evasive answers -- ousted three of the insurance unit's top executives.;  
The actions in both states should have raised red flags that would have warned
hundreds of thousands of consumers to steer clear of the Executive Life units,
industry experts say. Yet the flags were never hoisted by regulators.;  
Instead, despite serious concerns about the company and its business
practices, state regulators kept many important concerns to themselves.
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION> regulators did not require <ORGANIZATION>Executive Life of California</ORGANIZATION>, which
operated in all 50 states, to notify other state regulators that two-thirds of
the company's net worth had evaporated because of a state audit.;   So
policyholders continued to buy policies, annuities and other products from the
Executive Life units. When the insurers ultimately were seized -- making them
among the largest life insurance failures ever -- they had more than 400,000
policyholders and <MONEY>$13 billion</MONEY> in assets.;   Democrat <PERSON>John Garamendi</PERSON>, the
politically ambitious <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> insurance commissioner, maintains that his
Republican predecessor made some big mistakes. Policyholders would be far
better off if <PERSON>Roxani Gillespie</PERSON>, who served as <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>'s insurance
commissioner between <DATE>July 1986</DATE> and last <DATE>January</DATE>, seized Executive Life far
sooner -- possibly years ago, he said.;   However, other regulators disagree.
They maintain that state law didn't give <PERSON>Gillespie</PERSON> the power to seize
Executive Life or stop it from investing in the junk bonds that eventually
caused the company to unravel. Gillespie maintains that she paved the road
that <PERSON>Garamendi</PERSON> eventually took.;   Some maintain that the problem was simply
the system, an inconsistent patchwork of rules and regulations that varies
from state to state and that remains so secretive that regulators are often
unaware of actions taken by their peers.;   In <DATE>1974</DATE>, <PERSON>Carr</PERSON> hooked up with <ORGANIZATION>First
Executive</ORGANIZATION>, a troubled <LOCATION>West Los Angeles</LOCATION> insurance company. By the early <DATE>1980s</DATE>,
he was fueling exponential growth at the insurance holding company by selling
a new product called single-premium deferred annuities.;   To sell these
annuities, which promise investors a hefty payment in the future for a
relatively small amount today, <PERSON>Carr</PERSON>'s companies offered unusually high returns
to investors. And they could, because <PERSON>Carr</PERSON> backed the policies with an
investment portfolio stuffed with high-risk, high-rate junk bonds that
generally yield far higher returns than high-quality bonds.;   In the early
<DATE>1980s</DATE>, the company posted tremendous gains in profitability and net worth. It
earned high marks from all the big insurance rating firms.;   Of course, even
then some knew that what <PERSON>Carr</PERSON> was doing was a gamble. He was investing
policyholder funds in junk bonds -- a largely untested investment vehicle.
Worse still, he was buying heavily into private offerings where there was
little market for the securities other than that made by <PERSON>Michael Milken</PERSON>, the
young junk bond wizard who worked for the high-flying securities firm <ORGANIZATION>Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc.</ORGANIZATION>;   What was less known was that <PERSON>Carr</PERSON> was already running
into skirmishes with state regulators who seemed to consistently believe that
he had overstated his company's net worth. On several occasions, Executive
Life's net worth -- a key measure of a financial institution's health -- was
off by <MONEY>tens of millions of dollars</MONEY>, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> officials contended.;   In
<DATE>1986</DATE>, regulators forced the company to slash reported net worth by a whopping
<MONEY>$180 million</MONEY>, leaving Executive Life with less than <MONEY>$90 million</MONEY> in the bank.; 
 Why did investors ignore the regulatory disputes? For the most part, they
simply didn't know about them.;   <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>'s examiners forced Executive Life
to correct the statements it filed in the state, but they did not require the
company to amend financial statements filed in any other jurisdiction where
the company did business.;   By <DATE>1987</DATE>, some of the junk bonds that were backing
policies at the <ORGANIZATION>Executive Life</ORGANIZATION> units in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> were going
into default.;   State regulators also started to more closely scrutinize
<ORGANIZATION>First Executive</ORGANIZATION>'s insurance subsidiaries.;   <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> regulators' <DATE>1987</DATE> exam
found that Executive Life had taken <MONEY>millions of dollars</MONEY> in credits for
reinsurance. (Reinsurance is insurance for insurers -- essentially, allowing
one company to pass part of its risk to another company. That gives an insurer
the ability to write more business and collect more premiums. The reinsurer
collects a fee.) But on investigation, the reinsurance proved to be improper
or phony, regulators later said.;   <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> slapped a <MONEY>$250,000</MONEY> fine on the
company and forced it to boost capital by <MONEY>$151 million.</MONEY>;   The <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>
regulators also pushed successfully in <DATE>1987</DATE> for a bill that would limit
insurers' investments in junk bonds to <PERCENT>20 percent</PERCENT> of their assets.;   A
similar bill was also introduced in the <LOCATION>California Legislature</LOCATION> in <DATE>1987</DATE>, when
Executive Life had about <PERCENT>45 percent</PERCENT> of its assets in junk bonds.
Then-Assemblyman <PERSON>Patrick Johnston</PERSON>, a Democrat who had just been appointed to
head the <ORGANIZATION>Committee on Insurance and Finance</ORGANIZATION>, was its sponsor. Johnston asked
<PERSON>Gillespie</PERSON> for information and help in drafting the bill.;   <PERSON>Gillespie</PERSON> never
provided the committee with information or staff support, and she never
testified on the bill's behalf, <PERSON>Johnston</PERSON>, now a state senator, said in an
interview. Gillespie would not comment. In the end, the bill died in
<LOCATION>Johnston</LOCATION>'s committee after receiving support from only four of the committee's
20 members. When <ORGANIZATION>Executive Life of California</ORGANIZATION> failed, more than <PERCENT>65 percent</PERCENT> of
its assets were in junk bonds.;   <LOCATION>Executive Life of California</LOCATION> was allowed to
give its New York-based sister company the <MONEY>$151 million</MONEY> it needed to satisfy
capital demands of <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> regulators. A few years later, the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>
company contributed another <MONEY>$50 million</MONEY> to Executive Life of <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New
York</LOCATION> regulators said.;   <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> regulators, who were slashing Executive
Life's reported net worth by the tens of millions, also wanted the firm to
boost capital. The company did so by getting about <MONEY>$175 million</MONEY> in cash and
<MONEY>$170 million</MONEY> in IOUs from its parent, <ORGANIZATION>First Executive</ORGANIZATION>. First Executive raised
the money by borrowing it from investors. Thanks to the contribution from
<ORGANIZATION>First Executive</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Executive Life of California</ORGANIZATION> was able to report <MONEY>$204 million</MONEY>
in net worth at year-end of 1987.;   It turns out, however, that the <MONEY>$170
million</MONEY> IOU -- an asset of the insurer -- did not actually get delivered to
Executive Life until <DATE>February</DATE> or <DATE>March</DATE> of the following year. <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>
regulators have since said they knew that the company essentially falsified
its year-end financial statements to report that the asset was there when it
wasn't. However, they said they thought that this falsification was
"insignificant.";   Insurance rating services also largely ignored this issue
-- as well as several others -- maintaining that they were "technical
violations" that had little impact on the company's financial health.;   By
<DATE>1988</DATE>, however, Executive Life's finances were so tight that the company knew
it had to boost capital or stop writing new business. It attempted another
accounting maneuver designed to free up money set aside in loss reserves by
transforming a <MONEY>$700 million</MONEY> pool of junk bonds into so-called collateralized
bond obligations -- an investment-grade security.;   <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> examiners, who
learned about the bond swap in <DATE>1990</DATE>, decided the transaction was bogus, and
they forced the company to unravel the deal.;   By now, things were really
looking bleak. The junk bond market fell through the floor after <PERSON>Milken</PERSON> came
under investigation. And for <DATE>1989</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>First Executive Corp.</ORGANIZATION> posted the biggest
annual loss in its history thanks to a <MONEY>$1 billion</MONEY> writeoff in the company's
quickly souring investment portfolio.;   News of the staggering loss sent
policyholders into a panic. They swamped Executive Life's headquarters
demanding their funds. Before it was all over, policyholders had withdrawn
more than <MONEY>$3 billion</MONEY> from the teetering giant.;   Regulators went into crisis
mode. Suddenly state insurance supervisors nationwide were demanding financial
information from <ORGANIZATION>First Executive</ORGANIZATION> and its insurers. But for a year, state
officials simply monitored the situation -- they commissioned studies, waited,
watched and worried. All the studies, including three completed by <ORGANIZATION>Milliman &amp;
Robertson</ORGANIZATION>, a prominent actuarial consulting firm, came to the same conclusion:
The company could survive, insurance regulators said.;   In <DATE>1991</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>First
Executive</ORGANIZATION> posted another whopping year-end loss, which spurred a second run.
Garamendi seized the firm and froze its assets.;   He recently announced a
proposed <MONEY>$3 billion</MONEY> buyout of Executive Life by a French consortium that
should pay most policyholders <MONEY>81 cents</MONEY> on the dollar. Guaranty funds are
expected to kick in the difference for those with cash value policies worth
less than <MONEY>$100,000</MONEY>. However, those with larger accounts and some Executive
Life investors -- specifically those holding municipal bonds backed by the
insurer's guaranteed investment contracts -- stand to lose substantial sums.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  Five hundred investors, fearing their life insurance and pension money is lost
to the junk bond craze, confronted California's top regulator Friday over the
collapse of Executive Life Insurance Co.;    John Garamendi, sworn in this
year as the state's first elected insurance commissioner, fielded questions
from emotional holders of policies, annuities and investment contracts in a
vast county meeting room.  </LEADPARA>

ON COLLAPSE  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     He swore to protect them by quickly finding a buyer who will rebuild
Executive Life.;    And he listened to complaint after complaint: A man whose
handicapped daughter's annuity payments have been cut; a heart attack victim
who can't get insurance elsewhere but wonders if his premium payments "are
going into a hole"; investors whose requests to cash out policies are in
limbo.;    Of Executive Life's <MONEY>$10.1 billion</MONEY> in assets, <MONEY>$6.4 billion</MONEY> is
invested in junk bonds, by far the highest amount and proportion of any
insurer. The company boomed along with the junk bond market in the <DATE>1980s</DATE>, but
suffered big losses when junk bond defaults multiplied and the market for them
went soft.;    <PERSON>Garamendi</PERSON> urged the investors to pressure legislators to stave
off federal tax demands on Executive Life. More than anything else, those
could annihilate the company before he can find a buyer willing to
rehabilitate it, he said.;    If the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> collects <MONEY>$643 million</MONEY> in back taxes,
"it is a virtual certainty that we will have to liquidate" the company,"
<PERSON>Garamendi</PERSON> said. Liquidation would mean selling company assets without a ready
market, and the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> would receive funds before policyholders, <PERSON>Garamendi</PERSON> said.;
   "I must tell you that liquidation is an unmitigated disaster for everyone,
particularly for you," <PERSON>Garamendi</PERSON> said.;    At present, Executive Life death
benefits are being paid in full. Annuities, contracts to provide income for
life or for a specified time, are being paid at <PERCENT>70 percent</PERCENT>. Holders of
guaranteed investment contracts, more similar to bank certificate of deposits,
are being paid nothing.;    The meeting with the investors was the latest
high-profile move by the politically ambitious <PERSON>Garamendi</PERSON>, whose seizures of
Executive Life and fellow junk bond casualty <ORGANIZATION>First Capital Insurance</ORGANIZATION> have kept
him constantly in the public eye for the past month.;    <PERSON>Garamendi</PERSON> condemned
companies that replaced their pension plans with cheaper annuities offered by
Executive Life and other insurers.;    He said he would seek to hold the
employers responsible for making up the <PERCENT>30 percent</PERCENT> that <ORGANIZATION>First Executive</ORGANIZATION>
annuitants have lost since the seizure. Some companies, such as <ORGANIZATION>Maxxam Corp.</ORGANIZATION>'s
<LOCATION>Pacific Lumber</LOCATION>, have offered to do so at least on a limited basis. Others,
such as food and tobacco giant <ORGANIZATION>RJR Nabisco</ORGANIZATION>, have refused to help.  </TEXT>

   California insurance regulators reached a long-awaited
pact with French investors to acquire and rehabilitate failed
Executive Life Insurance Co. The proposal, which faces many
hurdles, would entail losses of billions of dollars for
Executive Life claimants.
   The elaborate, $3 billion plan for the second-largest
insurance failure in U.S. history is intended to provide
policyholders initially with about 81 cents on the dollar. It
calls for the sale of much of Executive Life's junk bond
portfolio at a price of $2.7 billion, or a little over half
the bonds' book value.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The rehabilitation calls for Executive Life's business to
continue through a successor company, owned by seven French
firms, while a separate French investor would take over its
junk bonds.
   Before proceeding, the plan must be approved by a
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION> state court after an open bidding period allows
rival offers that could improve on the French proposal. Tax
concerns as well as economic and market downturns could end
the pact. Moreover, a major group of Executive Life claimants
-- owed about <MONEY>$3 billion</MONEY> -- would receive nothing under the
plan.
   In announcing the agreement, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> Insurance
Commissioner <PERSON>John Garamendi</PERSON>, who took office earlier this
year, charged that state regulators "had failed to exercise
proper regulatory oversight as Executive Life slid in
financial chaos in the late <DATE>1980s</DATE>." <PERSON>Mr. Garamendi</PERSON> said that
the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> department is cooperating with a <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Justice
Department</ORGANIZATION> investigation. He declined to elaborate.
   Executive Life, the larger of two major insurance units of
<ORGANIZATION>First Executive Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, was deemed to be in hazardous
financial condition and seized by regulators <DATE>April 11</DATE>. The
proposed rehabilitation of the <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> insurer doesn't
directly affect efforts to sell the <ORGANIZATION>Executive Life Insurance
Co.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> unit, which is under the control of
regulators in that state.
   Despite its prospective pitfalls, the agreement announced
yesterday was welcomed by some policy holders and annuitants.
An organization representing many of them said through a
spokesman that "this is the first time in four months that
policy holders will be able to sleep soundly." <PERSON>Mr. Garamendi</PERSON>
praised the plan as "an excellent deal for policyholders,"
but added that he hoped other investor groups would offer
higher bids.
   The investor group, led by the French insurer <ORGANIZATION>Mutuelle
Assurance Artisanale de France</ORGANIZATION>, known as <ORGANIZATION>MAAF</ORGANIZATION>, is to provide
<MONEY>$300 million</MONEY> in new capital to the successor company to
Executive Life, dubbed <ORGANIZATION>Newco</ORGANIZATION>.
   Also signing was <ORGANIZATION>Altus Finance</ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of the French
bank <ORGANIZATION>Credit Lyonnais</ORGANIZATION>, which would pay the <MONEY>$2.7 billion</MONEY> for
Executive Life's junk bond portfolio. The bonds to be sold
have a book value of more than <MONEY>$5 billion</MONEY>, an adviser to the
<ORGANIZATION>California Insurance Department</ORGANIZATION> said. Credit Lyonnais is to
provide credit letters totaling <MONEY>$3 billion</MONEY> guaranteeing the
financial performance of both the <ORGANIZATION>MAAF</ORGANIZATION> investor group and
<ORGANIZATION>Altus</ORGANIZATION>, which has been negotiating for months with <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>
regulators.
   If completed, the proposed sale would put the newly
recapitalized Executive Life in the hands of an investor
group of relatively little-known entities. In addition to
<ORGANIZATION>MAAF</ORGANIZATION>, the partners would include the French investment and
holding companies <ORGANIZATION>Pallas Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Euris S.A.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Eurofinac S.A.</ORGANIZATION>,
SDI <ORGANIZATION>Vendome</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Marceau Investissements</PERSON> and a Swiss banking
firm, <ORGANIZATION>Omnium Geneve Group</ORGANIZATION>.
   Details about the group remained uncertain. A <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
spokesman declined to disclose the ownership that each
company would hold.
   <ORGANIZATION>MAAF</ORGANIZATION>, one of <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>'s largest mutual insurers, has assets
of about <MONEY>31 billion French francs</MONEY> (<MONEY>$5.34 billion</MONEY>), relatively
small by the standards of major world insurers. Founded in
<DATE>1950</DATE> to provide auto insurance for French craftsmen, it has
shown little interest until now in investing abroad.
   In addition to "<ORGANIZATION>Newco</ORGANIZATION>," the successor to Executive Life,
yesterday's agreement also anticipates a "liquidating trust"
that would receive about <MONEY>$500 million</MONEY> book value of real
estate assets that won't move to <ORGANIZATION>Newco</ORGANIZATION> and which <ORGANIZATION>Altus</ORGANIZATION> won't
buy. The liquidating trust also will receive claims from
state insurance guaranty funds and any settlements from
extensive litigation that may develop. Proceeds from the
trust would be added to policyholder assets, and could raise
future payouts above the <MONEY>81 cents</MONEY> on the dollar anticipated
at the start of the rehabilitation.
   <PERSON>Mr. Garamendi</PERSON> said details of the agreement are expected
to be filed in about 20 days with a <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> state court
that currently is overseeing Executive Life's
conservatorship. After the court filing, there is to be a
60-day period for competitive bidding by other interested
groups.
   <PERSON>Mr. Garamendi</PERSON> said that "there is at least one other
bidder" actively interested in a transaction, and that there
"may be" two or three others interested. He declined to name
any of the prospective bidders.
   The announcement contained bad news for holders of about
<MONEY>$3 billion</MONEY> of municipal bonds backed by Executive Life
guaranteed investment contracts, for which the agreement
makes no provision whatsoever. Earlier, <PERSON>Mr. Garamendi</PERSON>
proposed a settlement of <MONEY>30 cents</MONEY> on the dollar with
bondholders. But negotiations have broken down and
bondholders have asked a <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> court to determine
whether the guaranteed investment contracts that back the
bonds are a form of insurance policy that would rank equally
with more conventional life and annuity contracts.
   <PERSON>Christine Franklin</PERSON>, an attorney for one of the
municipalities issuing the bonds, expressed regret at the
decision but said the issuers, bondholders, and their
trustees will pursue their claims under a legal action
scheduled for trial <DATE>Sept. 30</DATE>.
   Court orders related to municipal bond claims could delay
or even derail the rehabilitation plan, lawyers noted.
   Other impediments threaten the prospective pact, <PERSON>Mr.
Garamendi</PERSON> noted. Among them is an <ORGANIZATION>Internal Revenue Service</ORGANIZATION>
claim for <MONEY>$643 million</MONEY> in back taxes and interest against
Executive Life for certain revenue in the early <DATE>1980</DATE>'s. The
tax implications of the proposed transaction itself aren't
clear and an adverse ruling from the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> on this could
scuttle the deal, the insurance commissioner said.
   The agreement permits the French investment group and
<ORGANIZATION>Altus</ORGANIZATION> to abandon the plan if economic conditions sour
substantially. Under certain conditions, however, <PERSON>Mr.
Garamendi</PERSON> may retain a right to sell Executive Life's junk
bonds to <ORGANIZATION>Altus</ORGANIZATION> at the <MONEY>$2.7 billion</MONEY> price whether or not
Executive Life is sold to the investor group. <ORGANIZATION>Altus</ORGANIZATION>, under
certain conditions, could also require the sale.

   NEW YORK -- Two investors in troubled First Capital
Holdings Inc.'s insurance products sued Shearson Lehman
Brothers Inc., charging that the brokerage firm underplayed
the riskiness of their investment.
   The lawsuit, filed in federal court here, says Shearson
misled investors into believing that First Capital products
such as annuities were "safe, risk-free and guaranteed"
investments. It alleges that after Shearson acquired a 44%
interest in First Capital, it organized a national effort to
sell First Capital annuities and used selling techniques
"typical of securities sales" as opposed to traditional
annuity sales.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The lawsuit further charges that <ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION>, which at the
time controlled a majority of seats on <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION>'s board,
was fully aware of the insurance holding company's "risky
investment policies" and "imperiled financial status." It
noted that as much as <PERCENT>38%</PERCENT> of <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION>'s assets were
invested in high-yield junk bonds. The lawsuit, filed by
investors <PERSON>Jay</PERSON> and <PERSON>Rae Peshkin</PERSON>, seeks class-action status.
   First Capital's junk-bond investments have deteriorated
sharply in value and regulators have halted policy
redemptions at <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION>'s insurance businesses, citing
the risk of major losses from forcing the company to use up
its cash and to sell assets at depressed prices. <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>'s
insurance commissioner has called on <ORGANIZATION>American Express Co.</ORGANIZATION>,
<ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION>'s parent, to take responsibility for shoring up
<ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION> by whatever means necessary.
   Shearson officials denied the lawsuit's charges. "Such
allegations are without foundation and will be contested,"
said a spokesman, who noted that the company has reduced its
interest in <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION> to <PERCENT>28%</PERCENT>. He also said a "handful" of
other similar cases are pending against the company.

last year. <ORGANIZATION>Healthnet</ORGANIZATION> had the fewest.;    Insurance Commissioner <PERSON>John Garamendi</PERSON>
said he hoped the "test scores," would help consumers shop for the best deal
and encourage companies with the most complaints to "clean up their act.";   
He released the report a day after issuing a similar survey of auto and
homeowner insurers.;    "For those who failed their exams, they better shape

consumers shouldn't judge companies solely on the survey but should also
consider firms' financial stability and policy prices.;    <PERSON>Garamendi</PERSON> called
<ORGANIZATION>United Insurance</ORGANIZATION> the "really bad news company in life insurance" with nine
times as many complaints as the industry average. A corporate executive, who
asked that his name be withheld, said he couldn't comment until he read the
survey.;    Five life insurers had zero complaints settled against them in

Among health insurers, <ORGANIZATION>Pioneer Life of Illinois</ORGANIZATION>, the 44th largest in

<PERSON>Garamendi</PERSON> said. Company officials had no immediate comment.;    <ORGANIZATION>Group Life
Insurance Co.</ORGANIZATION>, the 31st biggest health insurance firm, had zero complaints.;  
 The survey ranked the companies by the number of complaints as compared with
policies written. To make the list, a complaint had to involve a violation of
insurance law or code, or come from a client who turned to the state only
after failing to get a response from an insurer.;    Two junk bond-laden
companies that were seized this <DATE>spring</DATE> by the state, Executive Life and <ORGANIZATION>First
Capital Life</ORGANIZATION>, ranked third and fourth in complaints among life insurers last
year.;    <PERSON>Garamendi</PERSON> said he would demand the companies to do better once they
get back on their feet.;    Executive Life, then the fourth largest in the
state, had 57 complaints, or .343 for every <MONEY>$1 million</MONEY> in premiums. First
Capital, then the 46th largest, had 11 complaints, or .308 per <MONEY>$1 million</MONEY> in
premiums.;    Leaders chastised;  <PERSON>Garamendi</PERSON> chastised <ORGANIZATION>Prudential Insurance of
America and Metropolitan Life Insurance Co.</ORGANIZATION>, the first and third largest life
insurers in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, respectively, for ranking the eighth and ninth worst
in the survey.;    "As industry leaders, I expect them to lead in good service
as well as in sales," he said.;    <ORGANIZATION>Prudential</ORGANIZATION> received 94 complaints, or .227
per <MONEY>$1 million</MONEY> in premiums. Metropolitan 38 complaints, or .144 per <MONEY>$1 million</MONEY>
in premiums.;    Metropolitan also ranked ninth worst among health insurers,
with 49 complaints, or .413 per <MONEY>$1 million</MONEY> in premiums. " 'Get Met' is their
slogan. I suggest that if they don't improve their consumer service,
Californians will simply say, 'Met, nyet,' " <PERSON>Garamendi</PERSON> said.;    Insurer
disputes results;  <ORGANIZATION>MetLife</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>Charles Sahner</PERSON> said he believes the

<PERSON>Sahner</PERSON> said in a statement released from the company's <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> headquarters.;
   Last year, the <ORGANIZATION>Insurance Department</ORGANIZATION> investigated 1,197 complaints about

THREE BIDS for <ORGANIZATION>First Capital Life Insurance Company</ORGANIZATION>, the ailing San

The company was seized by the Californian regulators in <DATE>May</DATE> after its parent
company went into bankruptcy and a run by policyholders had developed.
The separate proposals came from <ORGANIZATION>Transamerica Life Occidental Insurance
Company</ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION>Pacific Mutual Life Insurance Company</ORGANIZATION>; and from <ORGANIZATION>Leucadia National
Corporation</ORGANIZATION>, the New York-based conglomerate, in conjunction with <ORGANIZATION>First
Capital</ORGANIZATION>'s creditors' committee.
The three proposals pose alternatives to a rehabilitation scheme, entailing
a Dollars 50m capital injection, put forward by <ORGANIZATION>Shearson Lehman Brothers</ORGANIZATION>,
the investment banking subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION>American Express</ORGANIZATION>.
Shearson was closely involved with <ORGANIZATION>First Capital</ORGANIZATION>, holding a 28 per cent

   LOS ANGELES -- The California Insurance Department said
two top officers of a now-failed First Capital Holdings Corp.
insurance unit reversed efforts to take money out of the unit
that were started shortly before the unit was seized by state
regulators.
   As previously reported, the California department
investigated whether Fred A. Buck, president of First Capital
Life Insurance Co., and Julia S. Kelly, a senior vice
president, improperly put themselves ahead of other
policyholders with attempted withdrawals.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The insurance department spokesman said that <PERSON>Mr. Buck</PERSON>
redeposited <MONEY>$100,000</MONEY> taken as a loan against an insurance
policy and that <PERSON>Ms. Kelly</PERSON> had canceled plans to transfer a
<MONEY>$40,000</MONEY> annuity to another insurance company.
   The spokesman said that <PERSON>Mr. Buck</PERSON>'s and <PERSON>Ms. Kelly</PERSON>'s actions
were voluntary and their earlier plans weren't illegal. The
department investigation was initiated, the spokesman said,
because the transactions were undertaken about three days
before <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> regulators moved to assert control over the
company's assets, raising concerns that department
confidentiality had been breached.
   Neither <PERSON>Mr. Buck</PERSON> nor <PERSON>Ms. Kelly</PERSON> was available to comment.
The executives previously have declined to comment on the
matter.
   Other matters concerning the company and employee actions
before the <DATE>May 13</DATE> state seizure are being investigated, the
insurance department spokesman said. The seizure has resulted
in a moratorium on all policy loans, redemptions and
transfers.

<LP>
   LOS ANGELES -- The Internal Revenue Service demanded $643
million in back taxes and penalties from First Executive
Corp.'s largest insurance unit, threatening efforts to
resuscitate the failed unit and endangering payments to
policyholders.
   The claim, filed Friday by the IRS, was disclosed
yesterday by John Garamendi, California's insurance
commissioner, who on April 11 put the unit, Executive Life
Insurance Co., under regulatory control, saying that it was
in "hazardous" financial condition. It is the largest
insurance failure ever.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Separately, <PERSON>Mr. Garamendi</PERSON> obtained a court order
authorizing Executive Life to pay <PERCENT>100%</PERCENT> of death benefits and
<PERCENT>70%</PERCENT> of qualified retirement annuities. Such payments have
been halted since the company was put under regulatory
control. Orders barring policy redemptions and loans remain
in effect. So too do prohibitions on payments under most
so-called Guaranteed Income Contracts, unless they apply to
specific annuitants named in the contracts, a spokesman for
the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> insurance department said.
   It's expected that life insurance payments under the new
authorization will total about <MONEY>$200 million</MONEY> over the next 12
months and that annual annuity payments will total <MONEY>$174
million</MONEY>.
   Although <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> claims of some sort are relatively common
step in bankruptcies and insurance insolvencies, the size of
the claim -- which might or might not be upheld -- is nearly
half again the <MONEY>$474.1 million</MONEY> surplus and capital reported by
Executive Life for the <DATE>1990 year end</DATE>. <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> regulators
told the company before taking it over that they were
considering accounting revisions that would result in a major
change to even the reported number.
   It wasn't clear how quickly the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> might move with its
demands on Executive Life. A demand for immediate funds could
result in an immediate move to liquidation, <PERSON>Mr. Garamendi</PERSON>
said. The notice sent to <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>'s insurance department
demands immediate payment, but the agency said it won't take
any action until it receives approval from a <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> state
court. <PERSON>Mr. Garamendi</PERSON> said he won't authorize any payments
unless ordered by the court.
   The <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> liens, filed with the <ORGANIZATION>California Secretary of
State</ORGANIZATION>'s office and with the state insurance department, list
<MONEY>$249 million</MONEY> sought in back taxes for the years <DATE>1981</DATE> to <DATE>1983</DATE>,
and <MONEY>$394 million</MONEY> in penalties and interest.
   <PERSON>Mr. Garamendi</PERSON> cautioned that the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> claim, if upheld,
could end payments to policyholders and annuitants and force
the company into liquidation, a step that the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>
commissioner and other regulators have sought to avoid. <PERSON>Mr.
Garamendi</PERSON> charged the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> with a last-minute action, saying
"these assets are desperately needed to pay Executive Life
policyholders and annuitants."
   In <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, a spokesman for the state's department of
insurance said the <ORGANIZATION>First Executive</ORGANIZATION>'s second-largest unit,
<ORGANIZATION>Executive Life Insurance Co.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, hasn't been served
with any claims for back taxes. The <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> unit, seized
last week by state insurance regulators, has continued to pay
death benefits and annuity payments, unlike <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, which
halted them while regulators analyzed the financial state of
the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> company.
   People close to <ORGANIZATION>Altus Finance</ORGANIZATION>, the <PERCENT>65%</PERCENT>-owned subsidiary of
Credit Lyonnais that has been discussing with regulators the
possible purchase and restructuring of both Executive Life
units, said that <ORGANIZATION>Altus</ORGANIZATION> remains interested in a transaction
but is analyzing the prospective impact of the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> action.
   <PERSON>Mr. Garamendi</PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> claim stems from a <DATE>1989</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>U.S.
Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> decision affecting taxation of insurance
companies. The decision, concerning <ORGANIZATION>Colonial American Life
Insurance Co.</ORGANIZATION>, limited the way insurance companies can deduct
certain costs of reinsurance. The court held that costs for
reinsurance -- which passes risks from one insurance company
to another -- must be deducted over time from taxable income,
rather than be deducted in the year that they're incurred.
   Insurance companies were allowed to make certain
adjustments in their <DATE>1989</DATE> filing that would limit their
liability for back taxes under the ruling. However, if those
adjustments weren't made, then all amounts owing for prior
years under the court-established principle can be levied, an
<ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> official said.
   It's not clear whether Executive Life made the required
adjustments for <DATE>1989</DATE>. <PERSON>Mr. Garamendi</PERSON> said people in his
department were aware of an <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> audit but that the federal
agency had declined to disclose details of its investigation,
which also wasn't included in a long list of government
investigations of <ORGANIZATION>First Executive</ORGANIZATION> and its units disclosed in
the company's 10K annual filing with the <ORGANIZATION>Securities and
Exchange Commission</ORGANIZATION>.
   Stressing the "enormous" potential damage of a liquidation
on Executive Life policyholders, the insurance industry and
state insurance guaranty funds, <PERSON>Mr. Garamendi</PERSON> said he was
contacting people in the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration and in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>
in an effort to have the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> action reversed. He added that
the current assessment is only for the years <DATE>1981</DATE> to <DATE>1983</DATE> and
that the application of the same tax principle to later years
could impose a much larger cost.
   The <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> insurance commissioner said he will
"re-evaluate" in 90 days the latest plan to pay benefits if
the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> tax charge hasn't been eliminated. He labeled the
chance of selling or restructuring the <ORGANIZATION>California Executive
Life</ORGANIZATION> unit as "slim to none" if the tax liability remains.
   <PERSON>Mr. Garamendi</PERSON> said that, in addition to <ORGANIZATION>Altus Finance</ORGANIZATION>, two
other groups have expressed interest in a purchase of
Executive Life. He declined to identify the groups, adding
that they hadn't formally made an offer. He indicated that
his department is considering at least an informal auction
process for Executive Life, agreeing to distribute detailed
information to interested buyers.

   New Jersey Life Insurance Co., already fighting off
seizure attempts by New Jersey regulators, was ordered by
California to stop writing and renewing policies.
   The California order comes as New Jersey seeks in court
today to take over New Jersey Life, which the state says is
insolvent and requires state intervention. The state won a
restraining order against the insurance company May 20, after
state examiners found what they believed to be a $36 million
deficit for New Jersey Life at the end of 1990. The state
said the company had claimed a $10 million surplus.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The restraining order expired at the end of <DATE>May</DATE>. A hearing
is scheduled today in state court in <LOCATION>Hackensack</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>, to
determine whether the company should be seized by the state.
<ORGANIZATION>New Jersey Life</ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION>Paramus</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>, is challenging a
state takeover.
   According to the order issued by <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> Insurance
Commissioner <PERSON>John Garamendi</PERSON> against <ORGANIZATION>New Jersey Life</ORGANIZATION>, which
does <PERCENT>16%</PERCENT> of its business in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, the company's
financial condition threatened to "render it insolvent" or
force it into liquidation. The stability of life insurance
contracts for 4,723 Californians was threatened, <PERSON>Mr.
Garamendi</PERSON> said.
   The <DATE>1990</DATE> annual statement filed by <ORGANIZATION>New Jersey Life</ORGANIZATION> with
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION> insurance regulators indicated a reserve credit of
<MONEY>$25.2 million</MONEY> for reinsurance ceded to <ORGANIZATION>RepublicVanguard Life
Insurance Co.</ORGANIZATION> under a "split co-insurance/modified
co-insurance" treaty. <PERSON>Mr. Garamendi</PERSON> recently said that such
treaties wouldn't be accepted in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> because they
artificially inflate an insurer's capital levels.
   As a result, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> said, <ORGANIZATION>New Jersey Life</ORGANIZATION> actually had
a <MONEY>$15.2 million</MONEY> deficit, putting the company below the
minimum capital and surplus needed to do business in
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION>. A hearing is scheduled for <DATE>Aug. 16</DATE> in <LOCATION>San

   LOS ANGELES -- The two finalists in a court-supervised
auction for Executive Life Insurance Co. submitted sweetened
bids for the failed insurer, putting the process closer to a
scheduled Thursday decision by California's insurance
commissioner.
   The offers by a French investor group led by Altus
Finance, a subsidiary of the French bank Credit Lyonnais, and
by a group led by San Francisco investment bankers Hellman &amp;
Friedman advanced somewhat from earlier promises, reducing
prospective losses for some claimants.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But the usual last-minute rush of bidding took an unusual
turn <TIME>last night</TIME> when the <ORGANIZATION>Hellman &amp; Friedman</ORGANIZATION> group tendered
their proposal nearly an hour after the court-imposed <TIME>4 p.m.
PST</TIME> deadline, potentially invalidating the offer.
   A spokeswoman for <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> Insurance Commissioner <PERSON>John
Garamendi</PERSON> said no special approval was given for the late
filing and that the commissioner would simply note its time
of arrival to the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> state court in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> that
is overseeing the auction.
   <PERSON>Mr. Garamendi</PERSON> is scheduled to announce a choice <DATE>Thursday</DATE>
between the two bids, which emerged as finalists in the
often-complicated three-month process. He will make a
recommendation to a <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> state court, which will have a
final say in the process. Several groups have already
suggested that they may challenge <PERSON>Mr. Garamendi</PERSON>'s choice.
   Last week, the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> insurance commissioner rejected
as too uncertain a bid mounted by the <ORGANIZATION>National Organization
of Life &amp; Health Guaranty Associations</ORGANIZATION>, representing
industry-funded state guaranty groups around the country. <PERSON>Mr.
Garamendi</PERSON> earlier had selected the bid provided its sponsors
were able to meet certain substantial conditions.
   Final concessions proposed by the French group would boost
initial recoveries by policyholders to just over <MONEY>90 cents</MONEY> on
the dollar from <MONEY>87 cents</MONEY>, the group said. Among other things,
the group increased to <MONEY>$3.55 billion</MONEY> the amount it proposes
to pay for most of Executive Life's junk bonds, a <MONEY>$250
million</MONEY> -- or <PERCENT>7.8%</PERCENT> -- increase.
   As well, policyholders would be given greater flexibility
and lower policy lending rates, changes that the group values
at <MONEY>$75 million</MONEY>.
   Also offered was a chance for policyholders who remain
with the company to share in steep penalties paid by
policyholders who leave early. This concession, together with
a slight reduction in those penalties, would give a further
<MONEY>$500 million</MONEY> back to policyholders, the French group said.
   As previously reported, the French group's proposal is for
<ORGANIZATION>Altus Finance</ORGANIZATION> to buy most of Executive Life's junk bonds,
thus replacing the bonds with cash in the company's
portfolio. Thereafter, the continuing company, called <LOCATION>Aurora</LOCATION>,
would receive a further <MONEY>$300 million</MONEY> in new capital and would
be owned by a separate investor group headed by insurer
<ORGANIZATION>Mutuelle Assurance Artisanale de France</ORGANIZATION>.
   The group headed by <ORGANIZATION>Hellman &amp; Friedman</ORGANIZATION>, together with
<LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> investor <PERSON>Samuel Zell</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>Zell/Chilmark Fund L.P.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Fund
American Cos.</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>General Motors Corp.</ORGANIZATION> pension funds, has
proposed a different approach, planning to keep the junk
bonds in Executive Life with the argument that that structure
better enables policyholders to participate in gains from the
bonds.
   In yesterday's offer, the <ORGANIZATION>Hellman &amp; Friedman</ORGANIZATION> group said
they sweetened an earlier profit-sharing plan for
policyholders, provided greater access to funds for
policyholders through loans, and boosted certain crediting
rates.
   Executive <ORGANIZATION>Life Insurance Co.</ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, was
seized in <DATE>April</DATE> by <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> regulators. Its <ORGANIZATION>Executive Life
Insurance Co.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> was seized by regulators in that
state at the same time. The auction for the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> unit
doesn't affect the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> companies. Both insurers were
units of <ORGANIZATION>First Executive Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, which is now in Chapter 11
bankruptcy-law proceedings.

   LOS ANGELES -- A California state court ruled that $1.85
billion of municipal bonds backed by failed Executive Life
Insurance Co. have a claim to company assets that is equal to
the claims of conventional insurance and annuities, shaking
elaborate restructuring plans for the insurer.
   The decision, issued Friday in Los Angeles, reversed state
regulators' assertions that the bonds were subordinate to
conventional insurance and sent prices for the thinly traded
securities soaring.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   If upheld, <PERSON>Judge Kurt J. Lewin</PERSON>'s surprising ruling will
sharply reduce prospective recoveries for big policyholders
at Executive Life to about <MONEY>73 cents</MONEY> on the dollar from an
earlier-expected <MONEY>90 cents</MONEY> and add an estimated <MONEY>$1 billion</MONEY> to
the industry's cost of clearing up its second-largest
insolvency ever -- roughly doubling outlays for an already
heavily committed insurance guaranty system.
   The so-called "muni-GICs" case concerns claims by holders
of eight issues of unusual municipal bonds totaling <MONEY>$1.85
billion</MONEY> that depend on Executive Life for payment of
principal and interest. <ORGANIZATION>GIC</ORGANIZATION> stands for guaranteed investment
contracts, a form of deposit with an insurer.
   Los Angeles-based Executive Life is a unit of <ORGANIZATION>First
Executive Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, which is in Chapter 11 bankruptcy
proceedings in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>. A smaller unit, <ORGANIZATION>Executive Life
Insurance Co.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, has been seized by regulators in
that state. The <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> company didn't issue any of the
so-called muni-GICs and isn't directly affected by <DATE>Friday</DATE>'s
court ruling.
   The case may prove one of the most expensive lessons ever
in state insurance regulation. Although <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> regulators
years ago determined that Executive Life's obligations
backing the bonds were "unauthorized," they made no move to
stop their issue.
   <PERSON>Judge Lewin</PERSON> held that "the {<LOCATION>California</LOCATION> Insurance}
<ORGANIZATION>Department</ORGANIZATION>'s failure to act provided a trap for the unwary
investors who purchased the municipal bonds" and added that
"a regulatory agency has an affirmative duty to do something
by way of regulation, not merely make academic
pronouncements."
   <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> Insurance Commissioner <PERSON>John Garamendi</PERSON> said, "If
this decision stands, it is a serious setback for certain
Executive Life insurance policyholders." He added that his
advisers were considering an appeal. Lawyers familiar with
the case say an appeal is almost certain.
   For the moment, plans to recapitalize and to sell
Executive Life are proceeding. A French investment group lead
by <ORGANIZATION>Altus Finance</ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of the French bank <ORGANIZATION>Credit
Lyonnais S.A.</ORGANIZATION>, said it will pursue its <MONEY>$3.55 billion</MONEY> plan to
acquire the company. As reported, the French group was chosen
<DATE>Thursday</DATE> after an extended auction.
   Altus and <ORGANIZATION>Mutuelle Assurance Artisanale de France</ORGANIZATION>, an
insurer leading part of the proposed sales transaction, said
the group "remained supportive of Commissioner <PERSON>Garamendi</PERSON> and
the process."
   But speculation rose immediately that <PERSON>Mr. Garamendi</PERSON>'s
reorganization plan was in trouble. The <ORGANIZATION>National Organization
of Life and Health Guaranty Associations</ORGANIZATION>, representing the
nation's industry-funded, state insurance guaranty funds,
hinted strongly that it will rescind a key agreement
coordinating and facilitating state guaranty fund payments.
And bondholders said they will immediately demand interim
payments at the same <MONEY>70 cents</MONEY> on the dollar rate that other
policyholders and annuitants have received since <DATE>April</DATE>, when
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION> regulators seized the insurer.
   Immediately after the decision was handed down at <TIME>6 p.m.
EST</TIME> <DATE>Friday</DATE>, prices of the bonds jumped 17 points, a gain of
<MONEY>$170</MONEY> for a bond with a <MONEY>$1,000</MONEY> face amount, to a price of 50
in heavy trading activity. Municipal bond traders say they
expect the bonds to open today at a price of about 65 as news
of the ruling spreads.
   Advocates for the muni-GIC bonds quickly predicted the
demise of the French group's takeover plan -- a plan that
bond interests say short-changes all creditors.
   The ruling is a blow to the nation's life insurance
industry, which, through state insurance guaranty funds, must
make good on much of Executive Life's uncovered liabilities.
The industry's bill, estimated at about <MONEY>$900 million</MONEY> before
<DATE>Friday</DATE>'s ruling, would swell by about a further <MONEY>$1 billion</MONEY>,
as limited assets are spread among a bigger pool of
liabilities.
   "We are going to have to pull out our pencils and see what
we can do to best address {the larger bill}," said <PERSON>Eden D.
Sarfaty</PERSON>, president, president of the <ORGANIZATION>National Organization of
Life and Health Guaranty Associations</ORGANIZATION>, which represents the
guaranty funds.
   The sudden doubling of demands on insurers likely will
boost industry pressure to pursue a proposal advanced by
<ORGANIZATION>Nolhga</ORGANIZATION> to acquire Executive Life. <ORGANIZATION>Nolhga</ORGANIZATION> was picked first by
<PERSON>Mr. Garamendi</PERSON> as the winner of the auction for Executive Life
but later rejected when the guaranty funds and their
corporate supporters couldn't satisfy special conditions
advanced by the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> commissioner, who asked for firmer
financial backing to the bid.
   <ORGANIZATION>Nolhga</ORGANIZATION> and others will pursue their bids in court
proceedings that begin today in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> before <PERSON>Judge
Lewin</PERSON>. The court is expected to hear a thicket of demands and
motions from muni-GIC interests as well as other parties in a
giant case turned topsy turvy with a single ruling.
   In effect, the "muni-GIC" court case goes to the heart of
competing, painful claims in Executive Life's insolvency.
   When Executive Life was seized in <DATE>April</DATE>, <PERSON>Mr. Garamendi</PERSON>
held that so-called "funding agreements" issued by Executive
Life to back the muni-GICs weren't conventional insurance
business and would rank as subordinate creditors in a
position reserved for suppliers and other unsecured
creditors, among others. Among other things, <PERSON>Mr. Garamendi</PERSON>
cited a <DATE>1987</DATE> opinion by an insurance department lawyer that
these unusual funding agreements weren't "authorized" as
insurance. The department at the time was headed by <PERSON>Roxannie
Gillespie</PERSON>, <PERSON>Mr. Garamendi</PERSON>'s predecessor.
   It was an important decision. By excluding the <MONEY>$1.85
billion</MONEY> of municipal GICs from Executive Life's nearly <MONEY>$10
billion</MONEY> in liabilities, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> regulators have been able
to substantially increase recoveries by conventional
policyholders and annuitants.
   Critics contended that <PERSON>Mr. Garamendi</PERSON>'s exclusion was
politically motivated. Few holders of the muni-GIC-backed
bonds live in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> while a large chunk of Executive
Life's conventional policyholders and annuitants do. <PERSON>Mr.
Garamendi</PERSON> has denied such assertions.
   In his opinion, <PERSON>Judge Lewin</PERSON> held that the muni-GICs'
funding agreements weren't substantially different from
so-called "pension-GICs," essentially certificates of deposit
with insurers by corporate pension funds and employee savings
plans, which <PERSON>Mr. Garamendi</PERSON> had included as creditors with
conventional insurance and annuities. Nor could a <DATE>1988</DATE> change
in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>'s insurance code apply retroactively to the
issue of the bonds.
   The muni-GIC bonds, sold in <DATE>1986</DATE> by obscure government
entities in <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Tennessee</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, were in large part underwritten by <ORGANIZATION>Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc</ORGANIZATION>.
   Although technically intended as borrowings by municipal
agencies for government purposes, money from the sales of
these bonds -- rated Triple-A by <ORGANIZATION>Standard &amp; Poor's Corp.</ORGANIZATION> --
went directly into funding agreements at Executive Life and
were in turn reinvested largely in junk bonds, many of them
sold by <ORGANIZATION>Drexel Burnham Lambert</ORGANIZATION>.

   LOS ANGELES -- Eight offers for Executive Life Insurance
Co. were tendered before the deadline in a court-supervised
auction, but wrangling over the nation's second-largest
insurance failure is far from over.
   In a surprise, last-minute move, the French investor group
that has been the lead bidder with a formally negotiated
proposal filed more than a month ago substantially sweetened
its earlier offer.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But there were no surprises among the bidders' names.
Notably absent were offers from any of the nation's largest
insurers. And though bids improved slightly in the final
rush, the proposals filed <DATE>Friday</DATE> by the <TIME>4 p.m.</TIME> deadline would
leave <MONEY>billions of dollars</MONEY> in losses by Executive Life
claimants and the insurance industry's guaranty funds.
   Despite the auction's official close, those that formally
filed proposals can still sweeten or combine their offers, a
number of which were incomplete and apparently intended as
opening gambits. There's likely to be extensive last-minute
jockeying among bidders.
   "We expect this to be a vigorous two weeks," said a
spokesman for <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> Insurance Commissioner <PERSON>John
Garamendi</PERSON>, who is slated to make a choice by <DATE>Oct. 25</DATE>. <PERSON>Mr.
Garamendi</PERSON>'s decision is subject to review by a state court in
<LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> that is overseeing Executive Life's legal
conservatorship. The company was seized in <DATE>April</DATE> by state
regulators.
   Proposals were received from both profit-minded investors
and groups with claims or interests in Executive Life. All
would continue Executive Life under a new name, with changes
in both its investment portfolio and obligations to
policyholders. Beyond that, however, the offers vary widely,
with some stripping Executive Life's vast junk bond portfolio
and others suggesting that the company can gain by retaining
the bonds rather than leaving gains from bankruptcy
reorganizations and sales to outside investors.
   The latest proposals now facing <PERSON>Mr. Garamendi</PERSON> and his
advisers are from the following groups:
   -- The French investor group headed by <ORGANIZATION>Altus Finance</ORGANIZATION>, a
subsidiary of the French bank <ORGANIZATION>Credit Lyonnais</ORGANIZATION>, and by insurer
<ORGANIZATION>Mutuelle Assurance Artisanale de France</ORGANIZATION>, which sweetened its
earlier bid, offering to buy most of Executive Life's vast
junk bond portfolio for <MONEY>$2.85 billion</MONEY> in cash -- a <MONEY>$150
million</MONEY> increase. The French insurer, known as <ORGANIZATION>MAAF</ORGANIZATION>, and its
partners said <DATE>Friday</DATE> that they would boost initial
policyholder values to <MONEY>86 cents</MONEY> from the <MONEY>81 cents</MONEY> offered
earlier and provide other concessions amounting to an added
value of <MONEY>$560 million</MONEY> to policyholders.
   -- <ORGANIZATION>Broad Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, which said it would buy Executive Life's
insurance and annuity business. But the Los Angeles-based
insurer said it doesn't want Executive Life's junk bonds.
Broad hinted strongly it wants to supplant the French <ORGANIZATION>MAAF</ORGANIZATION>
group as <ORGANIZATION>Altus</ORGANIZATION>'s partner, with <ORGANIZATION>Altus</ORGANIZATION> buying the junk bonds.
Otherwise, <ORGANIZATION>Broad</ORGANIZATION> said it has asked <ORGANIZATION>J.P. Morgan &amp; Co.</ORGANIZATION> to
finance some other buyer for the bonds. Part of its plan,
however, would leave the new Executive Life with a <MONEY>$2 billion</MONEY>
promissory note underwritten by the very bonds it wants to
sell.
   -- A <ORGANIZATION>Bondholder Protective Group</ORGANIZATION>, representing a portion
of the <MONEY>$1.85 billion</MONEY> of municipal bonds backed by Executive
Life funding agreements, and <ORGANIZATION>RRH Capital Management Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a
<LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> investment concern, which said they would retain the
junk bonds and restructure the company, among other things
issuing new securities to municipal bondholders. The
securities are intended to provide some return on bonds that
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION> regulators maintain rank behind all insurance
policies.
   -- A <ORGANIZATION>Bondholder Protective Committee</ORGANIZATION>, which asserted in a
letter of intent that it "reserved a bidding place" but
didn't offer any specifics. The committee represents the same
creditor class as the above group but is separate.
   -- A group comprising <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> investment bankers
<ORGANIZATION>Hellman &amp; Friedman; Zell-Chilmark Fund L.P.</ORGANIZATION>, an investment
partnership headed by <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> investor <PERSON>Samuel Zell</PERSON>; and <ORGANIZATION>Fund
American Cos.</ORGANIZATION>, a Vermont-based investment concern, which
would keep Executive Life's junk bonds and recapitalize the
company with <MONEY>$300 million</MONEY> of cash and an added <MONEY>$450 million</MONEY>
of standby guaranties.
   -- <ORGANIZATION>The National Organization of Life and Health Guaranty
Associations</ORGANIZATION>, an industry-backed group representing state
insurance funds, which would retain the junk bonds and inject
<MONEY>$300 million</MONEY> in new capital in the form of guaranties from
industry-backed state guaranty funds. The proposal by <ORGANIZATION>Nolhga</ORGANIZATION>,
as the group is known, is intended to reduce the cost of
Executive Life's failure to its member funds.
   -- <ORGANIZATION>The Official Creditors' Committee for First Executive
Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, the parent company of Executive Life that is in
Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings separate from the insurance
company's conservatorship, proposed a restructuring that it
said would pay policyholders <MONEY>100 cents</MONEY> on the dollar, take
advantage of various tax angles and count on a divided
ownership of the apparently insolvent parent company roughly
equally with municipal bondholders.
   The bids filed assert that policyholders would initially
receive between <MONEY>81 cents</MONEY> to <MONEY>86 cents</MONEY> per dollar of policy
cash value.
   Executive Life's giant junk bond portfolio, which has set
the Los Angeles-based company apart from other insurers, is
the key variable in the salvage plans. The bonds, with a face
value close to <MONEY>$6.8 billion</MONEY> and some estimates of eventual
worth ranging above <MONEY>$4 billion</MONEY>, have widely been seen as a
source of hidden value. But <DATE>Friday</DATE>'s bids revealed only
limited interest and financing for the portfolio. Altus alone
has offered cash for the bonds. The Broad and <ORGANIZATION>Rainwater</ORGANIZATION> group
bids have proposed intricate security swaps that would
continue to tie the company to the bonds.
   Offers by claimants and creditors, such as those by <ORGANIZATION>Nolhga</ORGANIZATION>
and the <ORGANIZATION>Bondholders' Protective Group</ORGANIZATION>, as well as the <ORGANIZATION>Hellman
&amp; Friedman</ORGANIZATION> bid, count on substantial gains from the junk
bonds and would retain them.
   But a <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> law signed just weeks ago may threaten
both plans that retain the bonds and those that "securitize"
them. The law limits the junk bond holdings of any insurer to
<PERCENT>20%</PERCENT> of assets -- a threshold exceeded by several plans.
   State <PERSON>Sen. Patrick Johnston</PERSON>, principal author of the bill,
in an interview, warned that statute seems to have been
ignored not only by would-be buyers of Executive Life but by
state insurance officials, who he said seem to be
backpedaling on the bill after earlier supporting it.
Complaining that "the ink is barely dry on the governor's
pen, the state senator said "it would be ironic indeed that
someone breached the standard immediately to clean up
Executive Life, the worst perpetrator of junk bond abuses."
   In addition to the junk bonds, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> insurance
commissioner <PERSON>Garamendi</PERSON> and his advisers will have to consider
dozens of details relating to the complexities of Executive
Life's insurance policies and annuity contracts.

   LOS ANGELES -- An issue central to one of the nation's
largest insurance failures will be debated in a trial opening
today, as trustees and underwriters of $1.85 billion in
municipal bonds backed by Executive Life Insurance Co. seek a
ruling that the bond claims rank equally with insurance
policies issued by the failed company.
   The case, in state court in Los Angeles, will determine
the fate of assets in the insolvency and uphold or overturn
California Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi's position
that Executive Life's obligation to the bondholders ranks
junior to its traditional insurance contracts.

   A victory by the bond claimants would sharply reduce
recoveries for large insurance policies and pose greater
demands on state insurance guaranty funds, as limited assets
would be used to cover a further <MONEY>$1.85 billion</MONEY> in liabilities
that barely enter into current workout proposals. Los
Angeles-based Executive Life is the one-time principal
insurance unit of <ORGANIZATION>First Executive Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, which itself is now
in Chapter 11 bankruptcy law proceedings.
   Analysts say that a bondholders' victory also could more
than double the value of the bonds themselves. The securities
currently trade for as little as <MONEY>20 cents</MONEY> on the dollar and
stand to recover almost nothing under the insurance
commissioners' current plan.
   The so-called "muni-GICs" have been the focus of a bitter
debate for months, with assertions of bad faith from both
sides in the scramble to cover about <MONEY>$9.87 billion</MONEY> in
liabilities with assets estimated to be worth roughly <MONEY>$3
billion</MONEY> less.
   <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> regulators contend that the bond litigation is
a selfish attack on scarce assets by the bond trustees and
securities underwriters, who face claims from bondholders in
separate litigation. "These people are trying to take money
that is in trust for {Executive Life's} policyholders and
bail themselves out of liabilities to bondholders," asserts
<PERSON>Karl Rubinstein</PERSON>, special counsel to <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>'s insurance
commissioner, adding that "their position would be
devastating to policyholders around the country."
   For their part, bond advocates argue that the position of
<PERSON>Mr. Garamendi</PERSON>, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>'s first elected insurance
commissioner, is colored by political bias and ambition,
noting that most bond holders neither live nor vote in
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, while many major insurance policyholders do. "We
see this as a political opinion," says <PERSON>Julio Herrera</PERSON>, an
analyst at <ORGANIZATION>RRH Capital Management</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, investment
advisers with clients who have invested in the bonds.
   Central to the case is whether the so-called "funding
agreements" governing money from the bonds are a part of
Executive Life's conventional insurance business or a
miscellaneous claim against the company's assets.
   Lawyers for the bond underwriters assert that the funding
agreements are in principal the same as various
company-issued annuities. If the court is to set aside the
muni-GICs, these lawyers argue, then it must set aside nearly
<MONEY>$5 billion</MONEY> of other claims, including annuities bought by
corporate pension funds and used to provide for victims in
personal injury cases.
   Lawyers for <ORGANIZATION>Texas Commerce Bank-El Paso</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of
<ORGANIZATION>Chemical Banking Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, and trustees for one bond
issue, take a somewhat different tack. They argue that
bondholder claims aren't governed by <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> law but by
<LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> law, where the funding agreements recently were deemed
a conventional insurance product.
   <PERSON>Mr. Rubinstein</PERSON>, special counsel to the commissioner,
retorts that the assertion of <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> law "is a product of the
Looney Toons studio in Hollywood."
   The tale of the muni-GICs began with the sale in <DATE>1986</DATE> of
just seven issues of the unorthodox bonds by municipal
agencies in <LOCATION>Tennessee</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION>, and
<LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION>. There were multiple issues in <LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>.
Although technically intended as borrowings by the municipal
agencies for government purposes, the monies went directly
into funding agreements at Executive Life, where they could
be withdrawn by the municipalities only under the most
onerous terms. According to court documents, just <MONEY>$6 million</MONEY>
of the <MONEY>$1.85 billion</MONEY> in muni-GICs was ever drawn for
government purposes. Executive Life, in turn, invested much
of the money in junk bonds. <ORGANIZATION>Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, the
failed investment banking concern and former employer of
now-jailed junk-bond king <PERSON>Michael Milken</PERSON>, played a pivotal
role in all but one of the bond issues.
   <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> insurance regulators contend that the bonds
were in effect an illegitimate ruse that converted Triple-A
bond borrowings into fodder for the burgeoning junk-bond
market. "The underlying transactions are a scandal of
unprecedented proportions," says the state's insurance
department in a brief to the court. State officials argue
that the bondholders' proper route for recovery is through
the extensive civil fraud actions now consolidated in federal
court in <LOCATION>New Orleans</LOCATION>.
