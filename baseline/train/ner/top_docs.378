<TEXT>
   Chinese Premier <PERSON>Li Peng</PERSON> met <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s emperor and
empress today and invited them to visit <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>, government officials
said.
   Li made the invitation during a 20-minute meeting with the newly
enthroned monarch at the <ORGANIZATION>Tokyo Imperial Palace</ORGANIZATION>, a senior <ORGANIZATION>Imperial
Household Agency</ORGANIZATION> official said.
   If the invitation is accepted, Emperor <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON> would be the
first Japanese monarch to visit <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>.
   But the palace spokesman said several problems exist and the
visit would have to await the end of a year of court mourning for
<PERSON>Akihito</PERSON>'s father, Emperor <PERSON>Hirohito</PERSON>, who died on <DATE>Jan. 7</DATE> at age 87.
   ``Premier <PERSON>Li</PERSON> said that he hoped the royal couple would visit
when the time was right for them. In reply, the emperor thanked him
but said the decision must be made by the government,'' said the
agency official.
   The official, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity,
said the two also discussed ``their nations' 2,000-year history,
including World War II.''
   Bitter memories of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s actions during World War II often
have clouded Japan-China relations. After sharp criticism by <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>
and other nations, Prime Minister <PERSON>Noboru Takeshita</PERSON> in <DATE>February</DATE>
retrated a statement that future historians must decide whether
<LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> was an aggressor.
   More than 10 million Chinese died during <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s 1937-45
invasion of the Chinese mainland. Beijing reacts strongly to any
Japanese attempt to deny responsibility.
   Japanese news reports have speculated that <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON> would express
regret over <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s militarist past during today's meeting, but
government officials refused to confirm or deny this.
   ``The emperor expressed his views on the nations' pasts, and Li
welcomed those views,'' said the official.
   Earlier today, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> announced it would lend <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> up to <MONEY>$734
million</MONEY> in the current fiscal year. The loan is to help fund 11
projects for modernization in <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>, including an expansion of
ports in <LOCATION>Lianyungang</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Qingdao</LOCATION> and construction of a subway in
<LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION>.
   Li is on a five-day official visit to <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> accompanied by
senior officials, including Foreign Minister <PERSON>Qian Qichen</PERSON>, who met
today with his Japanese counterpart, <ORGANIZATION>Sousuke Uno</ORGANIZATION>.
   The last Chinese premier to visit <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> was <PERSON>Zhao Ziyang</PERSON>, now
head of <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Communist Party</ORGANIZATION>, in <DATE>May 1982</DATE>.

  [Text] <LOCATION>Taipei</LOCATION>, <DATE>April 7</DATE> (CNA) -- <PERSON>Jeffrey Ku</PERSON>, chairman of 
the Taipei-based <ORGANIZATION>Chinatrust Commercial Bank</ORGANIZATION>, was granted an 
audience with Japanese Emperor <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON> <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> [6 <DATE>April</DATE>]. 
  "I feel honored to have met with the Japanese emperor at his 
<LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> palace," <PERSON>Ku</PERSON> said <DATE>Thursday</DATE> upon his return from a five-day 
visit to <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>. 
  Ku, also an unpaid advisor to <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION>'s Executive Yuan, 
stressed that his visit to <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> was private. 
  Ku said Emperor <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON> expressed his goodwill and regard 
for 
<LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION>. "<PERSON>Akihito</PERSON> was interested in <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION>'s current 
developments," he noted. 
  Ku said he briefed the Japanese emperor on <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION>'s economic 
strength and its role in Southeast Asian economic development. 
  "We also exchanged views on the possible impact on <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> of 
the <ORGANIZATION>North American Free Trade Agreement</ORGANIZATION> and the prospects for 
the formation of the proposed <ORGANIZATION>East Asia Economic Caucus</ORGANIZATION> and the 
Asian Free Trade Agreement," <PERSON>Ku</PERSON> said. 
  Ku was the first <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION> businessman granted a formal 
audience 
with <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON> since the emperor took the throne in <DATE>October 1989</DATE>. 
Akihito talked briefly with [passage indistinct]. 
  Political observers said <PERSON>Jeffrey Ku</PERSON>'s meeting with <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON> 
would boost the development of substantive ties between <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION> 
and <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, even though the Japanese emperor is just a spiritual 
leader and wields no political power. 
  <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> recognizes <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION> and has been reluctant to develop 
any official ties with <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION> for fear of offending communist 
Chinese leaders. 
  Many countries, including the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> and 
<LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>, have sent ministerial-level officials to visit <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION>, 
but <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> has not followed suit.

  [Text] <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>, <DATE>Jan. 1</DATE> KYODO -- The year <DATE>1994</DATE> will be busy 
for Emperor <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Empress Michiko</ORGANIZATION> with preparations 
proceeding for the couple's visits to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and 
<LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, the first attempt by a Japanese monarch to travel 
overseas twice in one year. 
  In mid-June, the emperor and the empress are expected to 
travel to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, where they will visit eastern, southern and 
western cities. They also plan to make a stopover in <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION> 
during the journey, official sources said. 
  Preparations are also under way for their trip to <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> 
and 
<LOCATION>France</LOCATION> in <DATE>autumn</DATE>, the sources said. 
  It will be the first time that a Japanese emperor will make 
more than one overseas trip in a year, they said. 
  A visit to the <LOCATION>Middle East</LOCATION> by <PERSON>Crown Prince Naruhito</PERSON> and his 
wife, <PERSON>Princess Masako</PERSON>, is also being considered, the first 
overseas trip by the couple since they got married <DATE>last June</DATE>, 
the sources said. 
  Emperor <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Empress Michiko</ORGANIZATION> spends [as received] the 
New Year's Day at a newly constructed residence within the 
Imperial Palace compound in central <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>. 
  On the opening of the New Year, the emperor said in a 
statement that he hopes disaster-stricken people will be able to 
stand firmly on their feet as quickly as possible, saying that 
the past year was full of numerous sufferings. 
  "It is highly regrettable that throughout the world many 
people are still victims of local conflicts," Emperor <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON> 
said in the statement. "On the other hand, it is gratifying to 
note signs of movement in the right direction, as in the case of 
<LOCATION>Cambodia</LOCATION>." 
  An unusually cool <DATE>summer</DATE> hit the already harsh economic 
environment and more than 400 people died or went missing in an 
earthquake and cloudbursts in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>. 
  On the quake-battered <LOCATION>Okushiri Island</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Hokkaido</LOCATION>, Emperor 
<PERSON>Akihito</PERSON> said in one of his waka [Japanese-style poem], "I am 
sorrowful, to see the smoke wreaths rising, from things burning 
out, 
  There along the island shore, all strewn with broken 
houses." 
  In <DATE>February</DATE>, the emperor and the empress will visit Iwo Jima 
and the <LOCATION>Ogasawara</LOCATION> islands, where the fiercest fighting in World 
War II took place. The imperial couple will make the visit to 
the islets in the <LOCATION>Pacific Ocean</LOCATION>, far south of <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>, to mark the 
25th anniversary of their return by the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> in <DATE>1969</DATE>, 
<ORGANIZATION>Imperial Household Agency</ORGANIZATION> officials said. 
  Empress <PERSON>Michiko</PERSON> expressed her joy in her waka at her eldest 
son's marriage to <PERSON>Masako Owada</PERSON>, a former career diplomat. 
  "Hand in hand, may you climb together, 
  The mountain, which, now green with foliage, must be 
garmented in serene beauty," her waka said. 
  Empress <PERSON>Michiko</PERSON>, who collapsed on her <DATE>59th birthday last 
October 20</DATE> and suffered speech impairment, has partially 
recovered her ability to speak, and her condition is slowly 
getting better, doctors said.

FT  22 OCT 92 / Thaw after a long winter: Emperor Akihito's historic visit
to China
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Conscious of the weight of history bearing down on him, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s Emperor
<PERSON>Akihito</PERSON> carefully delivers each of his pre-scripted public words,
punctuating the sentences with uncomfortably long silences and filtering the
emotion from a voice still ascribed supernatural qualities.
His tones will be more carefully measured than usual when he arrives in
<LOCATION>China</LOCATION> tomorrow for the first visit by a Japanese emperor. The humble <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON>
has made clear a sense of deep privilege that his reign should be chosen for
this journey.
The emperor's most obvious task will be to deal with the relatively recent
past, the invasion of <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> during the <DATE>1930s</DATE> and <DATE>1940s</DATE>, by delivering an
unambiguous apology and, perhaps, clearing the way for an era in which the
economic potential of the relationship will finally overcome the bitter
memories.
For the Communist party leaders who invited the emperor, the six-day visit
has a less lofty, more immediate purpose. They are still in the process of
convincing the Chinese people that the regime has the respect of the
international community, and any foreign dignitary has been much appreciated
since the <LOCATION>Tiananmen</LOCATION> crackdown of <DATE>1989</DATE>. In these circumstances, a visit by
the emperor is all the more welcome.
The Chinese government is also keen to attract Japanese investment, a
controversial issue during the early <DATE>1980s</DATE> when the revolutionary elders
drew comparisons between Japanese joint ventures in northern <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and the
occupation of <LOCATION>Manchuria</LOCATION> in the <DATE>1930s</DATE>, an occupation begun in the name of the
then Emperor <PERSON>Hirohito</PERSON>, father of Akihito.
It is a sign of the changed times that six leading trading houses, including
<ORGANIZATION>Mitsubishi Corp</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Mitsui &amp; Co</ORGANIZATION> yesterday announced a plan to build a
Dollars 4bn petrochemical complex in the northern Chinese province of
<LOCATION>Liaoning</LOCATION>. Japanese trading houses are also developing an industrial park in
the northern city of <LOCATION>Dalian</LOCATION>, and a Japanese trucking company has announced
plans for a transportation network in the north.
In the year of the <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON> visit, the 20th anniversary of the restoration of
Sino-Japanese relations, <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> will become <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s second-largest trading
partner, behind the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>, and up from fifth place a year ago. Japanese
investment in <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>, which rose from <ORGANIZATION>Dollars</ORGANIZATION> 349m in <DATE>1990</DATE> to Dollars 579m
last year, is likely to double this year, as manufacturers bruised by
falling profits source more of their components in low-cost and increasingly
reliable <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>.
The emperor is certain to laud this developing bilateral economic
relationship. But the flow of funds and an apology from the emperor are not
likely to appease a Chinese people raised on horrific tales of the 'burn
all, loot all, kill all' policies of the Japanese military during the second
world war.
Detailing the brutality of that period has served the Communist party's
interests as it highlights the 'heroic' role of revolutionary-era soldiers,
one of whom, <PERSON>Deng Xiaoping</PERSON>, is now an emperor himself in everything but
name. In deference to the Japanese emperor, <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION> has barred protests by
private groups seeking war compensation from <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> and taken much newspaper
space to explain the new, non-political role of <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON>.
<LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s foreign ministry is also emphasising the 'non-political' role of the
emperor, as enshrined in the constitution, and arguing that the event is
nothing more than a 'goodwill visit'. This interpretation is questioned by
some sceptical members of the ruling Liberal Democratic party.
Evidence of the relationship's rich and complex history is shown in the
varied opposition from left, right and middle-ground groups in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>. There
are complaints that the timing of the visit violates the emperor's
'non-political' status and about the flattering of a discredited Chinese
leadership.
Then there is concern that the exalted Japanese emperor is travelling to
'pay tribute'. Even at the height of Chinese influence over the <DATE>past two
millennia</DATE>, during which <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> imported a written language and the essence of
its spiritual and philosophic beliefs, no emperor crossed the sea to
<LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION>.

The emperor's 17-day tour will end with a poignant reminder of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s
ambiguous feelings over its wartime record. In this there is a parallel with
<LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>'s uncomfortable complexes over the recent D-Day landing
celebrations. For <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> the equivalent will come under the spotlight next
year, the 50th anniversary of the end of the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> war.
As the <LOCATION>Normandy</LOCATION> surf erases the tracks of <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>'s D-Day celebrations,
Emperor <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON> will stop in <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION> on his way home to lay a wreath at the
<LOCATION>US</LOCATION> national memorial cemetery of the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>Punch Bowl</LOCATION>.
The emperor's gesture, to the sadness of some in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, falls short of
the Japanese government's original plan for him to visit the USS <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>
memorial in <LOCATION>Pearl Harbour</LOCATION>, a battleship sunk by the Japanese attack on
<DATE>December 7 1941</DATE>. That idea was dropped because of fierce objections from
Japanese right-wing politicians and commentators, many of whom believe the
<DATE>1941</DATE> attack was unavoidable, maybe even justified.
Officially, the emperor is so mystically elevated that he must get less
involved in temporal affairs than his high profile counterparts in the
British or Spanish royal families.
So he politely declined last week to comment on whether or not the <LOCATION>Pearl
Harbour</LOCATION> attack could be justified, beyond saying that the war lay heavy on
his heart. 'It is very important to understand historical truths correctly,
but because of my position, I must refrain from touching on this kind of
subject,' he said.
Yet at the same time, Emperor <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON> has deliberately descended just a
little closer to earth than his father, <PERSON>Hirohito</PERSON>, a mark of the gradual
evolution of the world's oldest unbroken imperial dynasty.
Emperor <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON> was the first to ascend the Chrysanthemum throne, in <DATE>1989</DATE>,
as a human symbol of the state, rather than a god. His father, <PERSON>Hirohito</PERSON> was
born the Son of Heaven, but was obliged by the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> occupiers after the war to
renounce his divinity.
As such, Emperor <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON> appears to be trying to play a subtle, yet emotive
role in shaping <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s attempt publicly to come to terms with its wartime
past, the prerequisite for success in its campaign to become a fully fledged
member of the international community.
In this, the Emperor is in tune with a gathering mood of wartime regret in
mainstream <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, in line with his traditional role of embodying the
national spirit. Former prime minister <PERSON>Mr Morihiro Hosokawa</PERSON>'s
unprecedentedly explicit apologies over <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s wartime record and the
recent re-writing of school textbooks to include more detail of that record
are the latest signs of this.
While feelings of atonement are on the rise, there is certainly no common
view on war history, one of the several areas in which fault lines are
appearing in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s famous consensus.
There is a dangerous nationalist minority, as shown by the recent gun attack
against <PERSON>Mr Hosokawa</PERSON> by a right-wing protestor, angered at his wartime
apologies. The denial two months ago by a justice minister that an infamous
wartime atrocity never happened, damaged <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>'s increasingly vital Asian
relations. The minister resigned, but the suspicions he aroused will be hard
to soothe.
To some, the significance of Emperor <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON>'s role as a public figure is
ambiguous, as shown by the response of <PERSON>Mr Shintaro Ishihara</PERSON>, a right-wing
member of the opposition Liberal Democratic party, to the aborted <LOCATION>Pearl
Harbour</LOCATION> visit.
'I have never heard of a <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> president visiting the memorial hall in
<LOCATION>Hiroshima</LOCATION>,' he said, drawing a temporal comparison. Yet <PERSON>Mr Ishihara</PERSON> a moment
later elevated Emperor <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON> to semi-divinity. 'The emperor is the only
priest king in the world. I think it is good for the emperor to be mystical.
If the emperor is not mystical, he will no longer be eternal,' he argues.
The emperor has in the first five years of his reign worked hard to
contribute, as a globe trotting ambassador, to <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s temporal interests.
He has already visited the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> twice in his official capacity as Crown
Prince. His father made the trip once.
Two years ago, Emperor <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON> became the first Japanese emperor to visit
<LOCATION>China</LOCATION>, so helping to clear the way for closer economic and diplomatic links.
At the time, he pleased the Chinese government by saying he 'deeply
deplored' the suffering caused during the Japanese occupation. He stopped
short of apologising.
Earlier this year, Emperor <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Empress Michiko</ORGANIZATION> paid the first
imperial visit to the war memorial of <LOCATION>Iwo Jima</LOCATION>, a small <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> island where
many thousands of <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> and Japanese were killed. He carefully referred, at the
time, to the dead of both sides.
Akihito hopes that the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> visit will, as the one to <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> did, bring closer
ties. Of course he refrains from noting that his US tour is most timely,
just as a growing number of senior <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> government officials are getting
anxious that the strain in trade relations might spill over into political
and security relations.
Accordingly, the imperial couple have accepted a punishing schedule,
including 11 cities, starting in <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> today. They proceed to <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>
tomorrow, where they will be the guests of honour on <DATE>Monday</DATE> at the first
full state dinner of <PERSON>Bill Clinton</PERSON>'s presidency, a protocol compliment that
will not be lost on <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s humble emperor.

   Reporters bowed in respect as <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s Emperor
Akihito broke with imperial tradition <DATE>Friday</DATE> and held the throne's
first televised news conference since <DATE>1975</DATE>.
   Akihito, seated beside <LOCATION>Empress Michiko</LOCATION>, began the news
conference by expressing gratitude to 10,000 people who attended
the state funeral and the hundreds of thousands who lined the
streets after his father, <PERSON>Hirohito</PERSON>, died in <DATE>January</DATE> at 87.
   ``What I felt while I was in personal contact with Emperor Showa
gives me, I think, an important guideline in what an emperor should
be,'' said <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON>, referring to <PERSON>Hirohito</PERSON>'s posthumous name.
   Hirohito's 62-year reign _ the longest in Japanese history _
covered <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s disastrous war in <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> and its subsequent rise to
an economic superpower.
   Because of the constitution's strict ban on his exercising
political powers, <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON> could not comment on the crisis facing
<LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s governing conservatives, plagued by money and sex scandals.
   He said he would be willing to visit <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Korea</LOCATION> _ two
victims of Japanese aggression _ if the government decided it was
appropriate. He said the same for <LOCATION>Okinawa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s southernmost
prefecture, where many people remain bitter about the casualties
and destruction they bore in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> military assault. Hirohito
never visited <LOCATION>Okinawa</LOCATION> after the war.
   <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON> said the Daijo-sai, an elaborate ascension rite with
strong Shinto significance, should be carried out in accordance
with the law. Many critics already argue that by its very nature it
violates the constitution's ban of state involvement in religious
affairs.
   In that mystical ceremony to be held next year, <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON> is to
have his first communion with the gods and then be reborn divine.
Media reports have estimated it could cost as much as <MONEY>$70 million</MONEY>.
The government is studying how to conduct the rite.
   Reporters representing 43 Japanese and 12 foreign news
organizations attended the news conference. Journalists were given
a detailed explanation of when to rise and bow, and who would sit
where in the palace's Stone Bridge Room, a large hall with Japanese
sliding paper doors and Western-style red carpeting.
   Sitting behind a low table draped with gold brocade cloth
embroidered with chrysanthemums, the imperial symbol, the royal
couple spoke slowly and distinctly. At times the empress, wearing a
light green dress, spoke so softly her voice was drowned out by the
clicking of cameras.
   Akihito also spoke in polite but common Japanese, unlike his
father, who often used archaic or stilted words no longer
understood by the general public.
   Akihito repeatedly stressed that his proper role is to uphold
<LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s postwar constitution, which limits his role to that of a
``symbolic'' figurehead.
   Four of the 12 main questions, all submitted weeks in advance
and subject to government approval, were about <PERSON>Hirohito</PERSON>. Along with
the main questions, several follow-ups were allowed, but by
pre-decided Japanese questioners.
   One Imperial Household Agency official requested the scheduled
time limit of 30 minutes be carefully observed, because traffic
restrictions had been set for streets on the imperial couple's way
home. The conference lasted 37 minutes.
   Akihito is the first emperor to ascend the throne under the
postwar constitution, which limits his role to mostly ceremonial
tasks. The previous constitution gave <PERSON>Hirohito</PERSON> nominal powers, and
the wartime government asserted it was acting in his name.
   The constitution also omits all references to the emperor's
special relationship with the gods of Shinto, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s indigenous
religion, which angers some conservatives.
   <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s monarchy can trace its history to at least the <DATE>8th
century</DATE>, and by legend until the <DATE>6th century B.C.</DATE> and <PERSON>Emperor
Jimmu</PERSON>, who is said to have descended from the sun goddess,
<ORGANIZATION>Amaterasu</ORGANIZATION>.
   Michiko, rarely changing her expression of polite concentration,
said that because of her husband's heavy responsibilities she must
``make the home a place where he can...find peace and relaxation
with his family.''
   The royal couple split with the past by raising their two sons
and daughter by themselves. Akihito was raised by chamberlains from
age 3.
   Their eldest son, <PERSON>Crown Prince Naruhito</PERSON>, 29, is now seeking a
bride, and when asked about his growing independence, <PERSON>Michiko</PERSON> said,
``It would make me happy if he would come, even if only from time
to time, to play the viola for us.''

   Emperor <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON> today became the first
Japanese monarch to pay tribute at a monument to the 70,000 people
who died in the atomic bomb blast that devastated <LOCATION>Nagasaki</LOCATION> 45 years
ago.
   A steady rain fell as <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON>, accompanied by <ORGANIZATION>Empress Michiko</ORGANIZATION>,
bowed deeply and placed a bouquet of white flowers on a dark
granite cenotaph before the monument.
   Mayor <PERSON>Hitoshi Motoshima</PERSON> led <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON> to the site. <PERSON>Motoshima</PERSON> was
shot in the chest in <DATE>January</DATE> by an ultrarightist for saying the
late Emperor <PERSON>Hirohito</PERSON> could have helped end World War II sooner and
spared <LOCATION>Nagasaki</LOCATION>.
   <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> surrendered six days after the <DATE>Aug. 9, 1945</DATE> atomic bombing.
   Though <PERSON>Hirohito</PERSON>, now known in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> as <LOCATION>Emperor Showa</LOCATION>, visited
<LOCATION>Nagasaki</LOCATION> for a sporting event in <DATE>1969</DATE>, his son, <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON>, is the
first emperor to present flowers at the Peace Park memorial.
   As the emperor left the park, some of the 2,600 people who
attended sang ``<PERSON>Kimi Ga Yo</PERSON>,'' <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s unofficial national anthem.
Shouts of ``Banzai,'' a wish for long life, rang out when his
20-car motorcade arrived.
   ``The emperor is from a new generation, my generation,'' said
<PERSON>Sachiko Nagata</PERSON>, a store clerk who was seven years old when the bomb
fell. ``I think he has helped heal some of the wounds of the war by
coming here.''
   Police mobilized 4,000 officers to provide security for the
emperor and empress during their four-day visit to the city on the
southern island of <LOCATION>Kyushu</LOCATION>.
   The Roman Catholic mayor drew the ire of rightist groups with
his remarks about <PERSON>Hirohito</PERSON>. Before being shot, <PERSON>Motoshima</PERSON> received
countless death threats and lost his membership in the governing
Liberal Democratic Party.
   Japanese rightists represent a small minority but maintain a
high profile, dressing in military garb and driving through cities
in convoys of armored, painted trucks blaring march music. They are
staunchly nationalist.
   They also revere the monarchy and chastise those they believe
oppose it.

   Emperor <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON> has long lived in the shadow of his
father, the late <PERSON>Emperor Hirohito</PERSON>, and the memories of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s
headlong march into the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> War that <PERSON>Hirohito</PERSON>'s name evoked.
   But now that <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON> has assumed the throne left by his father's
death, many Japanese are looking to him as the symbol of a new age
- that of the generation who experienced war as children and
rebuilt the nation in peace.
   <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON> was 11 at the end of World War II, which Japanese
militarists had urged the nation into in the name of his father.
   The impact of surrender and reform under the guidance of
U.S.-led occupation forces deeply affected his youth.
   Before <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON> turned 13, <PERSON>Hirohito</PERSON> made his historic
renunciation of imperial divinity.
   Occupation troops departed <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> in <DATE>1952</DATE>, leaving behind them a
democratic constitution that renounced war and defined <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s
monarchs as ``symbols,'' not the priest-kings of bygone days.
   That imperial role seems to fit <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON>, who in one of his first
duties after assuming the throne upon the death of <PERSON>Hirohito</PERSON> in
<DATE>January 1989</DATE> promised to uphold the constitution ``along with the
people.''
   Akihito, born <DATE>Dec. 23, 1933</DATE>, bears a strong physical resemblance
to <PERSON>Hirohito</PERSON>, and has inherited his father's short, almost frail,
build. He also has his father's passion for science, and is a
respected scholar in the study of gobies, a type of mud-sucking
fish.
   Akihito speaks fluent English and is <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s most widely
traveled emperor. He has made official visits to 37 countries, his
first to <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> for the coronation of <ORGANIZATION>Queen Elizabeth II</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1953</DATE>.
   Reflecting the circumstances of his upbringing, <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON> is often
described by former schoolmates and palace officials as a more
democratically-minded, warmer person than the quiet, reclusive
<PERSON>Hirohito</PERSON>.
   He has also been far more prone to set his own precedents.
   Just three years after completing his education - <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON> was
the first emperor schooled alongside commoners - the royal heir
chose a commoner for his bride, making another break from the past.
   The woman, <PERSON>Michiko Shoda</PERSON>, was the daughter of one of the
nation's wealthiest businessmen, but their marriage in <DATE>1959</DATE> sent
shock waves through <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s former nobility.
   To the rest of the nation, however, the wedding was welcomed as
none before. About 500,000 people lined the streets for a chance to
see <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Michiko</LOCATION> in their horse-drawn carriage during a
parade after the ceremony.
   The royal couple again broke with tradition by raising their own
children, a decision prompted in part by <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON>'s desire to have
the family life he was denied as a child, according to <PERSON>Minoru
Hamao</PERSON>, a former imperial chamberlain.
   Taken away from his parents at an early age to be raised by
strangers, <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON> at times complained of the loneliness he felt
when his classmates would talk to him about their homes, said
<PERSON>Hamao</PERSON>, who served <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON> for two decades.
   Akihito's first child and heir, <PERSON>Crown Prince Naruhito</PERSON>, was born
<DATE>Feb. 23, 1960</DATE>. They have another son, <PERSON>Prince Akishino</PERSON>, and
daughter, <ORGANIZATION>Princess Nori</ORGANIZATION>.
   Though the crown prince remains single, Prince <PERSON>Akishino</PERSON> earlier
this year wed <PERSON>Kiko Kawashima</PERSON> - who, like the empress, had no royal
lineage.

<HEAD>Nothing Left to Chance When Emperor Leaves Palace</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   When the emperor of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> leaves his
palace in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>, nothing is left to chance.
   Determined to eliminate the element of surprise, officials in
this scenic coastal city on the southern island of <LOCATION>Kyushu</LOCATION> have
slaved for months over preparations for the arrival <DATE>Friday</DATE> of
Emperor <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Empress Michiko</ORGANIZATION>.
   Officials are particularly nervous because the emperor is to
meet Mayor <PERSON>Hitoshi Motoshima</PERSON>, who was shot in the back by a
rightist in <DATE>January</DATE>. The attacker was angry at <LOCATION>Motoshima</LOCATION> for saying
the late Emperor <PERSON>Hirohito</PERSON>, <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON>'s father, bore some
responsibility for World War II.
   About 4,000 police officers were being mobilized to ensure the
monarch's safety.
   Highlighting the emperor's four-day stay will be a visit to an
atomic bomb memorial at <LOCATION>Peace Park</LOCATION>, and the 41st annual <ORGANIZATION>Arbor Day
Festival</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Sunday</DATE>.
   The emperor, who is to plant a tree and give a short address, is
scheduled to spend less than an hour at the festival, but officials
reportedly are spending <MONEY>$50,000</MONEY> to deodorize a nearby pig farm.
   They also are planning to hang a curtain to keep the farm out of
the royal couple's sight, and have told media hoping to cover the
event by helicopter not to create any ruckus that might disturb the
animals.
   ``Sure, if the wind is right it could smell pretty bad at the
festival,'' said <PERSON>Yoichi Tanaka</PERSON>, head of general affairs for the
<ORGANIZATION>Nagasaki Prefectural Trade Union</ORGANIZATION>. ``But it's a pig farm, after all,
and there really isn't any need to try to hide that.''
   The strengthened police presence prompted a local newspaper, the
<ORGANIZATION>Nagasaki Shimbun</ORGANIZATION>, to complain in an editorial <DATE>Thursday</DATE> that
``excessive security'' could dampen ``the <LOCATION>Nagasaki</LOCATION> people's natural
desire to welcome their emperor.''
   The editorial, however, acknowledged the need for tight security
wherever the emperor goes. Leftist radicals strongly oppose the
monarchy and often have used violence to gain publicity for their
views.
   The same month that <PERSON>Motoshima</PERSON> was shot, leftists claimed
responsibility for firing projectiles that slightly damaged the
<LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> home of the emperor's younger brother, <ORGANIZATION>Prince Hitachi</ORGANIZATION>.
   Public opinion polls indicate the overwhelming majority of
Japanese support the monarchy, but there also are painful memories
of World War II, when the emperor's name was used to inspire
<LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s troops.
   After the war, <PERSON>Hirohito</PERSON>, whom the Japanese now call Emperor
Showa, visited all of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s prefectures except <LOCATION>Okinawa</LOCATION>, a string
of southern islands where some of the war's bloodiest battles were
fought and where ill feelings toward <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> still linger.
   Radicals broke through security and hurled firebombs at <LOCATION>Akihito</LOCATION>
and <PERSON>Michiko</PERSON> when they visited <LOCATION>Okinawa</LOCATION> in <DATE>1975</DATE>. Akihito, then crown
prince, and his wife narrowly escaped injury.

Outside the <ORGANIZATION>Imperial Palace</ORGANIZATION>, nearly 315,000 mourners signed registers of

Akihito, 55, is expected to be closer to the people than his father, who was

In his first speech as emperor, <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON> said he would continue on <PERSON>Hirohito</PERSON>'s

<TEXT>
   Emperor <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON> on <DATE>Friday</DATE> completed a centuries-old
ceremony signifying his accession to the world's oldest hereditary
throne while protests were held against the monarchy and the high
cost of the rite.
   The Shinto ceremony, symbolizing communion with the sun goddess,
has been performed by most of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s emperors since at least the
<DATE>7th century</DATE>, and in the past was believed to give monarchs their
status as living god.
   But demonstrators across the country criticized the ritual as a
violation of the Japanese constitution's separation of church and
state and questioned the use of nearly <MONEY>$17 million</MONEY> in tax money on
the ceremony.
   Other critics of the Daijosai, or <ORGANIZATION>Great Food Offering Ritual</ORGANIZATION>,
also believe holding it indicates a desire within <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s
conservative government to bring back the emperor worship of prewar
days.
   The rite, witnessed by only two female attendants, was held
<DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> and then repeated before dawn <DATE>Friday</DATE>.
   Anti-monarchy radicals marked the beginning of the ceremony by
launching six mortar-like projectiles at an imperial villa in
<LOCATION>Kyoto</LOCATION>, in western <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, police said.
   Radicals were also believed to have set fires at three Shinto
shrines and four train stations outside of the capital of <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>
just after <TIME>midnight</TIME>. No injuries were reported.
   Separate peaceful protests were staged by scholars and labor
unionists, and 1,000 Christians fasted to protest the funding of
the rite.
   Akihito, 56, is the first Japanese emperor to be enthroned since
his father, the late Emperor <PERSON>Hirohito</PERSON>, assumed the Chrysanthemum
Throne 62 years ago.
   He is also the first to assume the throne under <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s postwar
constitution, which calls him not a god-king but a symbol of his
people's sovereignty.
   Akihito's formal state enthronement ceremony <DATE>Nov. 12</DATE> was viewed
by foreign dignitaries representing 158 countries, but no
foreigners were invited to the communion.
   During the rite, <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON> offered rice, wine and other foods from
around the country to the sun goddess <ORGANIZATION>Amaterasu</ORGANIZATION>, from whom legend
says the imperial line descended.
   The two women attendants are clad in white and red kimono and
with their hair tied in pony tails nearly 6{ feet long. The
ceremony is held in the torch-lit inner sanctuary of a specially
built hall on the palace grounds.
   The rite is performed only once by each emperor.
   Inside the sanctuary, out of view of the 733 Japanese guests
seated in large tents nearby, the offerings were made to an altar
placed beside a stylized bed, from which the goddess is summoned.
   Scholars before World War II theorized that at one time the
ceremony might have involved the emperor symbolically having sex
with the sun goddess, representing a union with the divine. Palace
officials, however, deny that theory and said the emperor would not
touch the bed.
   The second ceremony was repeated after <TIME>midnight</TIME> in an identical
hall yards from the first one.
   Akihito performs dozens of religious ceremonies at the palace
each year, carrying on the priest-king role that has been handed
down from ancient times.
   That role, however, has periodically come under fire since the
end of World War II.
   <PERSON>Hirohito</PERSON>, who died in <DATE>1989</DATE> at age 87, renounced the concept of
imperial divinity in <DATE>1946</DATE> at the urging of the U.S.-led occupation
forces. The country's post-war constitution specifies that the
emperor is a national symbol, and not a god-king.

invitation again to the imperial couple as they bid farewell to 
<PERSON>Kim</PERSON> and his wife Son Myong-sun at the <ORGANIZATION>Akasaka Palace</ORGANIZATION>, said 
<PERSON>Kiyoshi Sumiya</PERSON>, the agency's grand master of ceremonies. 
  Kim told the couple during the 20-minute meeting that he 
wishes to invite them to visit <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION> at a proper time. 
  During an audience at the imperial palace on <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, the 
president officially invited <PERSON>Emperor Akihito</PERSON> and Empress Michiko 
to visit <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION> to forge a new future-oriented 
relationship. At that time, the emperor replied the Japanese 
Government would decide on whether he will go to <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION>. 
  The visit by <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s monarch, however, is still a sensitive

<TEXT>
   President <PERSON>Roh</PERSON> Tae-woo <DATE>today</DATE> said ``no
amount of apology can be fully satisfactory'' for <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s brutal
colonization of <LOCATION>Korea</LOCATION>, but that <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s expressions of regret are
the basis for a new relationship.
   Roh returned today from a three-day trip to <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, during which
he invited Emperor Akihito to make the first Japanese imperial
visit to <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION>.
   The invitation came after <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON> expressed regret for the
colonization of <LOCATION>Korea</LOCATION> nearly half a century ago, and Japanese Prime
Minister <PERSON>Toshiki Kaifu</PERSON> extended ``honest apologies'' for Korean
suffering in the colonial period.
   Roh, upon his arrival in <LOCATION>Seoul</LOCATION>, said it was time for the two
countries to put the past behind them.
   ``Even if we may feel that the Japanese apologies do not fully
live up to our expectations, we should accept them with magnanimity
and generosity, now that <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> has forthrightly admitted its
mistakes,'' he said at an airport news conference.
   During the colonial period, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> tried to stifle Korean culture
by banning Koreans from learning their language and forcing them to
adoptJapanese names. Tens of thousands of <LOCATION>Koreans</LOCATION> were killed after
being drafted for the Japanese war efforts.
   ``I well understand what feelings my fellow countrymen have
about what went on between our country and <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> in the past. No
amount of apology can be fully satisfactory,'' <PERSON>Roh</PERSON> said.
   Some <PERSON>Koreans</PERSON> said Japanese measures to clear up current sore
points were more important than apologizing for the past.
   There are unresolved disputes over discrimination against
<LOCATION>Koreans</LOCATION> living in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, aid to <LOCATION>Koreans</LOCATION> who remain displaced after
being forcibly removed from their homeland to perform wartime labor
for <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, and assistance to Korean survivors of the atomic
bombings of <LOCATION>Hiroshima</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Nagasaki</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Roh</PERSON> said he had asked <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> to move forward on these issues and
expressed satisfaction with the progress made so far.
   About 20,000 police had been mobilized in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> to provide
security for <PERSON>Roh</PERSON> during his three-day state visit against possible
threats from extreme leftist or rightist groups. But no incidents
were reported.
   Roh's visit to <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> was only the second by a South Korean head
of state since the two countries established diplomatic relations
in <DATE>1965</DATE>. Roh's predecessor, <PERSON>Chun Doo-hwan</PERSON>, visited <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> in <DATE>1984</DATE>.
   <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Korea</LOCATION> have a long history of enmity and sore points
still linger from <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s 1910-45 colonization of the <LOCATION>Korean
Peninsula</LOCATION>.
   The centerpiece of <PERSON>Roh</PERSON>'s visit was the <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> state
banquet at which <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON> expressed his ``deepest regret'' for the
suffering Koreans endured at Japanese hands. Kaifu offered his
``sincere remorse and honest apologies,'' and said good relations
between <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Korea</LOCATION> are a basis for peace in the region.
   Roh extended the invitation to <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Empress Michiko</ORGANIZATION> to
visit <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION> during a short meeting with the emperor today at
the <ORGANIZATION>Akasaka State Guesthouse</ORGANIZATION>, said a palace official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   ``After your coronation I am sure that you will visit many
countries, and I hope that you will consider visiting <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION>
also,'' the official quoted <PERSON>Roh</PERSON> as saying.
   Akihito, who assumed the throne after the death of his father,
Emperor <PERSON>Hirohito</PERSON>, will not travel abroad until after his official
coronation on <DATE>Nov. 12</DATE>. The coronation is traditionally delayed by a
year of mourning for the deceased emperor.
   Akihito would be the first emperor to visit <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION> since
its creation after <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s defeat in World War II.
   Japanese <ORGANIZATION>Foreign Ministry</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>Taizo Watanabe</PERSON> said <PERSON>Kaifu</PERSON>
had also accepted an invitation from <PERSON>Roh</PERSON> to visit <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION> at a
mutually convenient time.

<HEAD>Man Throws Smoke Bomb At Emperor's Motorcade</HEAD>

   Two people threw a smoke bomb and a firecracker at
Emperor <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON>'s motorcade <DATE>Sunday</DATE> as it headed for the Imperial
Palace in Kyoto after another of the rites of Akihitio's
enthronement, police said.
   A bystander suffered an eye injury as the firecracker landed
among people watching the motorcade pass, said an official of the
Kyoto state police.
   The man and woman, who were arrested immediately, did not
respond to police investigators' questions, the official said.
   He said they might be connected with radical leftists who
declared in leaflets last <DATE>Thursday</DATE> that they would ``completely
crush'' the royal couple's visit to Kyoto and nearby <LOCATION>Nara</LOCATION>.
   Leftist groups oppose the monarchy and say <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s emperor
system is a symbol of militarism.
   The smoke bomb landed in the road, pouring out smoke a minute
before the car carrying Emperor <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Empress Michiko</ORGANIZATION> reached
the spot, the official said. The car slowed, but <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON> might not
have noticed the incident, he added.

   Emperor Akihito formally assumes the world's oldest
hereditary throne <DATE>Monday</DATE> in lavish ceremonies that also may be an
important rite of passage for postwar <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>.
   No other monarch has ascended the <ORGANIZATION>Chrysanthemum Throne</ORGANIZATION> under the
constitution enacted in <DATE>1946</DATE>.
   For the first time, a Japanese emperor is to be enthroned as
merely a national symbol, as stipulated by the constitution imposed
by the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> occupation after <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s surrender in World War II.
   Most Japanese appear comfortable with the largely ceremonial
role of their new emperor, a remarkable break with the past. The
late Emperor <PERSON>Hirohito</PERSON>, <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON>'s father, was enthroned as a living
god and was the object of fanatical devotion.
   Even the official name the government has given <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON>'s reign
- Achieving Peace - reflects a desire to move away from the
turbulent times of <PERSON>Hirohito</PERSON>, who died of cancer early last year.
   The monarchy dates to the 6th or 7th century, but the Japanese
public associates it most closely with <PERSON>Hirohito</PERSON>'s 60-year reign. In
that period, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> waged expansionist wars in the name of the
emperor, suffered a crushing defeat and foreign occupation, then
rose to become an economic superpower.
   Akihito, 56, became emperor immediately after his father's
death, but his formal enthronement awaited a year of mourning and
the growing of ``sacred'' rice for a coronation rite.
   During the interval, <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON> has tried to create a softer, more
open image for the often aloof royal family, insisting on fewer
uniformed police along his procession routes and addressing people
with the title ``san,'' a term of respect similar to <PERSON>Mr.</PERSON> or <PERSON>Mrs.</PERSON> in
English.
   Reflecting the different times in which they were raised,
<PERSON>Akihito</PERSON> is believed to be more democratic in thinking than his
father, and has pledged to ``protect the constitution along with
the people.''
   Empress Michiko, the first commoner to marry a future Japanese
monarch, is crafting her own quiet revolution inside the royal
household, in large part by providing <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON> with a family life
similar to that of ``common'' Japanese.
   She broke tradition, for example, by making clear that her
children would not be taken away and raised by strangers.
   Although the palace remains distant to most Japanese, opinion
polls indicate it has wide public support. Few, however, still see
their monarch as a god.
   Government officials say they have taken pains to adapt the
enthronement ceremonies to a more democratic age. They also have
hewn closely to prewar precedent for the nearly month-long rites,
however, creating widespread concern that the ``new era'' might
actually represent a step backward in time.
   Royalty, heads of state and other dignitaries from more than 150
nations will be in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> when <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON> announces his accession on
<DATE>Monday</DATE>.
   The main coronation ceremony will be at the imperial palace, an
oasis of greenery in cetral <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> built in the <DATE>late 19th century</DATE>
on the site of a former samurai castle.
   Akihito will ascend a 20-foot-tall throne on a three-layered
dais of black lacquer, beneath an octagonal roof adorned with
golden mirrors and phoenixes.
   Prime Minister <PERSON>Toshiki Kaifu</PERSON> will stand before the throne as
<PERSON>Akihito</PERSON>, in a reddish-brown kimono with a design of paulownia
trees, bamboo and mythical animals, reads an address announcing his
accession.
   Kaifu will lead the Japanese among the 2,500 guests in three
rounds of ``Banzai!'' - a traditional cheer for long life - to
conclude the 30-minute ceremony.
   Officials say <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON> will read his announcement in colloquial
Japanese, unlike <PERSON>Hirohito</PERSON>'s use of stilted classical language most
Japanese cannot understand.
   To reflect the postwar constitution's emphasis on popular
sovereignty, <PERSON>Kaifu</PERSON> will lead the banzai cheers from a point level
with the throne instead of descending several steps, as his
predecessors did.
   An official in the prime minister's office told reporters a
military salute coinciding with the enthronement would be reduced
from 100 to 21 cannon shots because ``that's the way foreign
dignitaries are received.''
   Aside from such cosmetic adjustments, <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON>'s coronation is
expected to be much like those held since his great-grandfather
assumed the throne in the middle of the <DATE>last century</DATE>.
   In what many critics of the government see as a snub to the
constitution, about <MONEY>2.5 billion yen</MONEY> (<MONEY>$17 million</MONEY>) in public money
will be spent on a rite steeped in <LOCATION>Shinto</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s state religion
until <DATE>1945</DATE>.
   In that rite, to begin 10 days after the main coronation
ceremony, <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON> will step back into the world of myth for a
``communion'' of fresh rice with the sun goddess, from whom the
imperial line is said to have descended, and all the gods of heaven
and earth.
   Opponents say public funding violates the constitutional
separation of church and state. The <PERSON>Kaifu</PERSON> administration argues
that the money is not being used to promote religion, but to
preserve an important cultural tradition.
   Critics emphasize that the rite has undergone major changes
during its 1,200 years of existence. It was ignored for more than
200 years, beginning in the <DATE>late 15th century</DATE>.
   In response to questions about whether holding the Daijosai, or
<ORGANIZATION>Great Food Offering Ritual</ORGANIZATION>, is intended to restore living-god
status to <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON> and future emperors, <PERSON>Nobuo Ishihara</PERSON>, the deputy
cabinet secretary, replied:
   ``I am aware that there were some scholars in the prewar period
who claimed that, through performance of the Daijosai, the emperor
assumed a divine nature. However, the government is not in a
position to make any comment as to whether the emperor does or does
not.''
   Police have begun <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s largest security operation, mainly
because ultra-leftist radical groups have said they will disrupt
the ceremonies. A bomb believed planted by radicals exploded last
week at a <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> police dormitory, killing one officer and wounding
six other people.
   Late last month, 26,000 <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> police officers were mobilized for
security in the capital, and at least 6,000 more have been brought
in since. Nearly <PERCENT>45 percent</PERCENT> of the total coronation budget of <MONEY>12.3
billion yen</MONEY> (<MONEY>$94.6 million</MONEY>) is being spent on security.
   A high-ranking <ORGANIZATION>National Police Agency</ORGANIZATION> official, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said the extraordinary security was
justified because leftist radicals ``are planning to attack the
palace with explosive rockets.''
   He said police believe one group has devised mortar-like weapons
with a range of nearly four miles.
   Along with protecting the many visiting dignitaries, including
Prince Charles of <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> and Vice Presidnt <PERSON>Dan Quayle</PERSON>, the police
are concerned about security for a parade after the coronation.
   Akihito and <ORGANIZATION>Empress Michiko</ORGANIZATION> are to ride in a convertible in the
30-minute procession from the imperial palace to the royal
residence at <ORGANIZATION>Akasaka Palace</ORGANIZATION>.
   Officials say about 10,000 officers will line the three-mile
route.

and earth.
   Opponents say public funding violates the constitutional
separation of church and state. The <PERSON>Kaifu</PERSON> administration argues
that the money is not being used to promote religion, but to
preserve an important cultural tradition.
   Critics emphasize that the rite has undergone major changes
during its 1,200 years of existence. It was ignored for more than
200 years, beginning in the <DATE>late 15th century</DATE>.
   In response to questions about whether holding the Daijosai, or
<ORGANIZATION>Great Food Offering Ritual</ORGANIZATION>, is intended to restore living-god
status to <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON> and future emperors, <PERSON>Nobuo Ishihara</PERSON>, the deputy
cabinet secretary, replied:
   ``I am aware that there were some scholars in the prewar period
who claimed that, through performance of the Daijosai, the emperor
assumed a divine nature. However, the government is not in a
position to make any comment as to whether the emperor does or does
not.''
   Police have begun <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s largest security operation, mainly
because ultra-leftist radical groups have said they will disrupt
the ceremonies. A bomb believed planted by radicals exploded last
week at a <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> police dormitory, killing one officer and wounding
six other people.
   Late last month, 26,000 <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> police officers were mobilized for
security in the capital, and at least 6,000 more will be brought in

budget of <MONEY>12.3 billion yen</MONEY> (<MONEY>$94.6 million</MONEY>) is being spent on
security.
   A high-ranking <ORGANIZATION>National Police Agency</ORGANIZATION> official, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said the extraordinary security was
justified because leftist radicals ``are planning to attack the
palace with explosive rockets.''
   He said police believe one group has devised mortar-like weapons
with a range of nearly four miles.
   Along with protecting the many visiting dignitaries, including
Prince Charles of <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> and Vice President <PERSON>Dan Quayle</PERSON>, the police
are concerned about security for a parade after the coronation.
   Akihito and <ORGANIZATION>Empress Michiko</ORGANIZATION> are to ride in a convertible in the

   Emperor Akihito formally assumes the world's oldest
hereditary throne <DATE>Monday</DATE> in lavish ceremonies that also may be an
important rite of passage for postwar <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>.
   No other monarch has ascended the <ORGANIZATION>Chrysanthemum Throne</ORGANIZATION> under the
constitution enacted in <DATE>1945</DATE>.
   For the first time, a Japanese emperor is to be enthroned as
merely a national symbol, as stipulated by the constitution imposed
by the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> occupation after <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s surrender in World War II.
   Most Japanese appear comfortable with the largely ceremonial
role of their new emperor, a remarkable break with the past. The
late Emperor <PERSON>Hirohito</PERSON>, <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON>'s father, was enthroned as a living
god and was the object of fanatical devotion.
   Even the official name the government has given <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON>'s reign
- Achieving Peace - reflects a desire to move away from the
turbulent times of <PERSON>Hirohito</PERSON>, who died of cancer early last year.
   The monarchy dates to the 6th or 7th century, but the Japanese
public associates it most closely with <PERSON>Hirohito</PERSON>'s 60-year reign. In
that period, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> waged expansionist wars in the name of the
emperor, suffered a crushing defeat and foreign occupation, then
rose to become an economic superpower.
   Akihito, 56, became emperor immediately after his father's
death, but his formal enthronement awaited a year of mourning and
the growing of ``sacred'' rice for a coronation rite.
   During the interval, <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON> has tried to create a softer, more
open image for the often aloof royal family, insisting on fewer
uniformed police along his procession routes and addressing people
with the title ``san,'' a term of respect similar to <PERSON>Mr.</PERSON> or <PERSON>Mrs.</PERSON> in
English.
   Reflecting the different times in which they were raised,
<PERSON>Akihito</PERSON> is believed to be more democratic in thinking than his
father, and has pledged to ``protect the constitution along with
the people.''
   Empress Michiko, the first commoner to marry a future Japanese
monarch, is crafting her own quiet revolution inside the royal
household, in large part by providing <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON> with a family life
similar to that of ``common'' Japanese.
   She broke tradition, for example, by making clear that her
children would not be taken away and raised by strangers.
   Although the palace remains distant to most Japanese, opinion
polls indicate it has wide public support. Few, however, still see
their monarch as a god.
   Government officials say they have taken pains to adapt the
enthronement ceremonies to a more democratic age. They also have
hewn closely to prewar precedent for the nearly month-long rites,
however, creating widespread concern that the ``new era'' might
actually represent a step backward in time.
   Royalty, heads of state and other dignitaries from more than 150
nations will be in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> when <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON> announces his accession on
<DATE>Monday</DATE>.
   The main coronation ceremony will be at the imperial palace, an
oasis of greenery in central <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> built in the <DATE>late 19th century</DATE>
on the site of a former samurai castle.
   Akihito will ascend a 20-foot-tall throne on a three-layered
dais of black lacquer, beneath an octagonal roof adorned with
golden mirrors and phoenixes.
   Prime Minister <PERSON>Toshiki Kaifu</PERSON> will stand before the throne as
<PERSON>Akihito</PERSON>, in a reddish-brown kimono with a design of paulownia
trees, bamboo and mythical animals, reads an address announcing his
accession.
   Kaifu will lead the Japanese among the 2,500 guests in three
rounds of ``Banzai!'' - a traditional cheer for long life - to
conclude the 30-minute ceremony.
   Officials say <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON> will read his announcement in colloquial
Japanese, unlike <PERSON>Hirohito</PERSON>'s use of stilted classical language most
Japanese cannot understand.
   To reflect the postwar constitution's emphasis on popular
sovereignty, <PERSON>Kaifu</PERSON> will lead the banzai cheers from a point level
with the throne instead of descending several steps, as his
predecessors did.
   An official in the prime minister's office told reporters a
military salute coinciding with the enthronement would be reduced
from 100 to 21 cannon shots because ``that's the way foreign
dignitaries are received.''
   Aside from such cosmetic adjustments, <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON>'s coronation is
expected to be much like those held since his great-grandfather
assumed the throne in the middle of the <DATE>last century</DATE>.
   In what many critics of the government see as a snub to the
constitution, about <MONEY>2.5 billion yen</MONEY> (<MONEY>$17 million</MONEY>) in public money
will be spent on a rite steeped in <LOCATION>Shinto</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s state religion
until <DATE>1945</DATE>.
   In that rite, to begin 10 days after the main coronation
ceremony, <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON> will step back into the world of myth for a
``communion'' of fresh rice with the sun goddess, from whom the
imperial line is said to have descended, and all the gods of heaven
and earth.
   Opponents say public funding violates the constitutional
separation of church and state. The <PERSON>Kaifu</PERSON> administration argues
that the money is not being used to promote religion, but to
preserve an important cultural tradition.
   Critics emphasize that the rite has undergone major changes
during its 1,200 years of existence. It was ignored for more than
200 years, beginning in the <DATE>late 15th century</DATE>.
   In response to questions about whether holding the Daijosai, or
<ORGANIZATION>Great Food Offering Ritual</ORGANIZATION>, is intended to restore living-god
status to <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON> and future emperors, <PERSON>Nobuo Ishihara</PERSON>, the deputy
cabinet secretary, replied:
   ``I am aware that there were some scholars in the prewar period
who claimed that, through performance of the Daijosai, the emperor

  [Text] <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>, <DATE>May 25</DATE> KYODO -- Japanese Ambassador to the 
<LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> <PERSON>Takakazu Kuriyama</PERSON> said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> [25 <DATE>May</DATE>] <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> 
needs to take steps to significantly reduce its current account 
surplus and implement a market-opening package to successfully 
conclude the trade framework talks with the <LOCATION>U.S. 
  Kuriyama</LOCATION>, who is currently in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> to prepare for the 
upcoming <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> visit by <PERSON>Emperor Akihito</PERSON> and <PERSON>Empress Michiko</PERSON>, made 
the remarks at a press conference at the <ORGANIZATION>Foreign Ministry</ORGANIZATION>. 
  He said <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> agreed <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> to get the 
deadlocked framework talks back on track because both sides 
shared the view that it is undesirable to keep tense economic 
and trade relations "drifting" since that would hurt overall 
bilateral relations. 
  <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> also reached the accord because it 
deepened understanding about each other's positions on the trade 
negotiations, he said. 
  Kuriyama said the greatest problem regarding economic and 
trade relations between <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> is that there is a 
lack of mutual trust. 
  <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> fears the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> will try to apply numerical targets to 
measure the openness of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s market and threaten sanctions if 
that target is not met, while the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> mistrusts <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> as a 
country always vowing to do something and then not, he said. 
  Opinion polls in both countries also show that trust and 
respect toward each others' nations are waning, <PERSON>Kuriyama</PERSON> said, 
attributing the reason to the failure of the framework 
negotiations in <DATE>February</DATE>. 
  The trade framework talks is aimed at boosting mutual 
understanding, he said. 
  Kuriyama, who is in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> from <DATE>Monday</DATE> through <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, said 
he carried a message to Emperor Akihito from <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> President <PERSON>Bill 
Clinton</PERSON> welcoming the imperial visit to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> 
  Emperor <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON> and <PERSON>Empress Michiko</PERSON> are scheduled to visit 
the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> from <DATE>June 10</DATE> to 25. 
  Touching on concerns abroad that <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> may come to possess 
nuclear weapons, <PERSON>Kuriyama</PERSON> said he tries to sweep away such 
concern by explaining <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s nonnuclear position and the 
Japanese people's feeling on the matter. 
  The ambassador said it is impossible for <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> to possess 
nuclear weapons because an overwhelming majority of the people 
are against it and because <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> is a member of the nuclear 
<ORGANIZATION>Nonproliferation Treaty</ORGANIZATION> (NPT) and, therefore, has an 
international obligation not to possess nuclear weapons. 
  Also, not a single country among <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s neighbors support 
<LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> possessing nuclear weapons, he said.

  The imperial couple is scheduled to return to <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> on <DATE>June 
26</DATE>. 
  The emperor's entourage will include former Prime Minister

<TEXT>
   More than 100,000 people thronged to the Imperial
Palace on <DATE>Sunday</DATE> to cheer newly enthroned <PERSON>Emperor Akihito</PERSON>, but
radicals set off several bombs near a shrine he is to visit.
   Akihito, <PERSON>Empress Michiko</PERSON> and other royal family members,
protected by bulletproof glass, came out onto the palace balcony
eight times during the day to greet the well-wishers, which the
<ORGANIZATION>Imperial Household Agency</ORGANIZATION> numbered at 109,800.
   Loud shouts of ``Long live the emperor!'' rang through the
palace courtyard as he finished his short statement giving thanks
to the crowds.
   Akihito became emperor immediately after his father, Emperor
<PERSON>Hirohito</PERSON>, died in <DATE>January 1989</DATE>. His formal enthronement <DATE>Nov. 12</DATE>
followed a mourning period. Enthronement-related ceremonies are to
continue into <DATE>December</DATE>.
   At least four explosions occurred <DATE>Sunday</DATE> near the <LOCATION>Grand Shrines</LOCATION>
of Ise, 180 miles southwest of <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>, which <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON> is to visit
next week, said an official of <ORGANIZATION>Mie Prefectural Police</ORGANIZATION> who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   No injuries or major damage were reported in the explosions, two
of which occurred at the Ujiyamada railway station and two along a
railway track near the station.
   The emperor and empress are to use the railroad when they travel
to Ise to pray to the sun goddess on <DATE>Nov. 27-28</DATE>. <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s line of
emperors is said to have descended from the sun goddess <ORGANIZATION>Amaterasu</ORGANIZATION>.
   Radicals claimed responsibility for dozens of explosions and
fires in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> during <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON>'s enthronement. None caused serious
injuries.
   The radicals oppose the monarchy as a remnant of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s prewar
imperialism.

<TEXT>
   <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s new imperial era was formally named
``Heisei'' _ or Achieving Peace _ to set a new tone for <ORGANIZATION>Emperor
Akihito</ORGANIZATION>'s reign after the turbulence of his father's 62-year epoch,
the government announced today.
   Chief Cabinet Secretary <PERSON>Keizo Obuchi</PERSON> announced the new name,
which will be used on calendars and official documents.
   Under a <DATE>1979</DATE> law, and a custom dating back 1,300 years, a new
name is assigned when a new emperor ascends <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s 2,600-year-old
Chrysanthemum Throne.
   Emperor <PERSON>Hirohito</PERSON> died today of intestinal cancer after a 3{-month
illness. He was 87.
   His oldest son, <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON>, 55, immediately succeeded him.
   ``Heisei'' was chosen for <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON>'s reign because the word,
consisting of two Chinese characters, ``includes the meaning of
achieving peace domestically, internationally and in heaven,'' Prime
Minister <PERSON>Noboru Takeshita</PERSON> said in a statement.
   ``I think it is the most appropriate era name to reflect the
coming `new age,''' <PERSON>Takeshita</PERSON> said.
   The new era officially begins <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, with this year becoming
Heisei 1. The name was approved by <PERSON>Takeshita</PERSON>'s Cabinet today, and
<PERSON>Akihito</PERSON> signed with a calligraphy brush to give the measure formal
effect.
   Reflecting <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s postwar democratic constitution, private
citizens were included for the first time on the council that
recommended three names for the new era to the Cabinet. The group
also included Cabinet ministers, <ORGANIZATION>Imperial Household Agency</ORGANIZATION> officials
and scholars.
   The opinion of the new emperor was not given much weight.
   Hirohito's reign, which began <DATE>Dec. 25, 1926</DATE>, was known as <ORGANIZATION>Showa</ORGANIZATION>,
the era of ``enlightened peace.'' By the Japanese calendar, this
year was Showa 64.
   During the Showa era, <PERSON>Hirohito</PERSON> saw his nation plunge into World
War II and suffer history's first atomic attack, announced its
surrender, and later saw it rise to economic superpower status.
   On the death of <PERSON>Hirohito</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s longest-reigning monarch,
<PERSON>Akihito</PERSON> succeeded automatically to the throne, becoming the 125th
emperor in the world's oldest imperial line _ held by the same
family since at least the <DATE>8th century</DATE> and by legend since 660 B.C.
   In a ceremony a few hours after <PERSON>Hirohito</PERSON> died, <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON> received
three sacred treasures _ a sword, jewels and the imperial seal _
that have been handed down through the centuries.
   Other ceremonies were expected to extend over at least two years,
ending with the formal enthronement.
   A debate over naming the eras of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s emperors had flared
between opposition parties and the conservative <ORGANIZATION>Liberal Democratic
Party</ORGANIZATION>, which revived the era-naming clause in <DATE>1979</DATE> after it was
dropped from the postwar constitution.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Socialist Party</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Communist Party</ORGANIZATION> favor the exclusive
use of the Western calendar and charge that naming eras violates the
constitutional provision that sovereignty rests with the Japanese
people.
   The era-naming tradition was imported from <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>, and reflected a
belief that the sovereign controlled time itself.

  [Text] In a meeting with reporters on 31 <DATE>January</DATE>, Kong 
No-myong, <ORGANIZATION>ROK</ORGANIZATION> ambassador to <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, said: "It is time to hold 
full-scale discussions on ROK-Japanese cultural exchanges based 
on personnel exchanges. Particularly in this <LOCATION>Visit Korea</LOCATION> Year, 
the government must reexamine its tourist policy to induce 
Japanese tourists, who patronize <ORGANIZATION>ROK</ORGANIZATION> tourism the most, and 
consider adding Chinese characters to Korean signs." 
  Ambassador Kong, who returned home temporarily to attend the 
overseas mission chiefs meeting to be held here beginning 2 
<DATE>February</DATE>, said that our people should abandon their "new policy 
of seclusion" [saeroun swoeguk chongchaek] for 
internationalization and opening up. 
  The following are questions and answers from the meeting 
between Ambassador Kong and reporters: 
  [Unidentified reporter] Some people point out that it is too 
early for the <ORGANIZATION>ROK</ORGANIZATION> to exchange mass culture [taejung munhwa] with 
<LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> in view of the present indiscriminate infiltration of 
Japanese culture. 
  [Kong No-myong] Japanese books, video tapes, and television 
programs from satellite broadcasting services are now virtually 
opened to us. We should publicly introduce high-quality mass 
culture instead of overlooking its unlawful infiltration. An 
agreement on the general opening of mass cultural markets was 
reached in ROK-Japanese summit talks held <DATE>last year</DATE>, but the 
details of this issue have yet to be discussed. Accordingly, we 
have to hurry to take active measures. 
  [Reporter] What are the main agenda items to be discussed 
during President <PERSON>Kim Yong-sam</PERSON>'s visit to <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> in <DATE>March</DATE>? 
  [Kong] There is no pending political issue. Issues on 
economic cooperation between the <ORGANIZATION>ROK</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, such as mutual 
cooperative relations in preparation for the <LOCATION>Uruguay</LOCATION> Round 
treaty and methods to vitalize the ROK-Japanese Industrial and 
<ORGANIZATION>Technological Cooperation Committee</ORGANIZATION>, will be discussed. 
  [Reporter] Will President <PERSON>Kim</PERSON> meet Japanese Emperor <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON> 
when he visits <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>? Will the Japanese emperor visit the <ORGANIZATION>ROK</ORGANIZATION>? 
  [Kong] As his <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> visit is a state visit, President <PERSON>Kim</PERSON> 
will probably meet the Japanese emperor. If the Japanese 
emperor visits the <ORGANIZATION>ROK</ORGANIZATION>, it would be a significant event. The 
decision on the date of his <ORGANIZATION>ROK</ORGANIZATION> visit is a domestic affairs 
matter and must be made prudently. 
  [Reporter] Does the North Korean nuclear issue have any 
relation to the establishment of diplomatic relations between 
<LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>North Korea</LOCATION>? 
  [Kong] <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> is willing to resume negotiations with <LOCATION>North 
Korea</LOCATION> whenever it wants. <LOCATION>North Korea</LOCATION>, however, has not yet made 
any noteworthy sign. <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> says that the resolution of the 
North Korean nuclear issue is not a prerequisite [chonje chogon] 
for Japanese-North Korean negotiations on establishment of 
diplomatic ties, although the nuclear issue is important.

   Emperor <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON> told his people <DATE>Monday</DATE> that he would
obey the constitution and work for world peace, then offered a
public farewell to his late father, <PERSON>Hirohito</PERSON>.
   Akihito's remarks, his first public statement since ascending the
<LOCATION>Chrysanthemum Throne</LOCATION>, came one day after his father was wrapped in a
white robe and placed in a coffin, where he will lie in state for
six weeks of funeral rites.
   More than 438,000 mournings came out in drizzling rain to honor
the dead emperor at the Imperial Palace. Akihito became emperor
shortly after <PERSON>Hirohito</PERSON> died of cancer <DATE>Saturday</DATE> at age 87.
   The 55-year-old <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON> spoke in clear and somber tones for four
minutes. The new Empress Michiko, 54, was on his left wearing a long
black veil. The new <PERSON>Crown Prince Naruhito</PERSON>, 28, was on his right.
   ``I pledge I will be always with the people at any time and abide
by the Japanese Constitution,'' <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON> said. The postwar
constitution bans the emperor from any role in government and limits
him to ceremonial functions, signing bills into law and serving as
``symbol of the state and the unity of the people.''
   ``Based on this I will exert my responsibility. I hope for
further development of the country's fortunes and world peace and
improved welfare of the human race,'' he said.
   In Japanese tradition, <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON>'s statement was his first Imperial
Rescript, a time for a new emperor to set a tone for his reign and
to mourn his predecessor.
   ``I sincerely mourn the late emperor's demise,'' <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON> said.
``Based on stipulations of the Japanese Constitution and the
Imperial rules, I hereby succeeded to the throne. ... Considering
its heavy duties, I recognize solemn feeling from the bottom of my
heart.''
   The ceremony, held in the main hall of the Imperial Palace,
lasted just seven minutes but was an important milestone in the
transition to <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON>'s new imperial era of <ORGANIZATION>Heisei</ORGANIZATION>, or ``achieving
peace.''
   The simple rite was attended by Prime Minister <PERSON>Noboru Takeshita</PERSON>
and about 300 people from the imperial family, government,
<ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION> and the judiciary.
   Hirohito will be buried <DATE>Feb. 24</DATE> after lying in state for more
than six weeks, the Cabinet announced <DATE>Sunday</DATE>.
   Thousands of police were deployed to prevent attacks by radical
leftist and rightist groups who equate the emperor with Japanese
militarism and nationalism.
   Hirohito, died after a 62-year reign that stretched from <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s
descent into militarism and defeat in World War II to its
astonishing recovery into an economic superpower.
   Chief palace physician <PERSON>Akira Takagi</PERSON> said doctors knew in
<DATE>September 1987</DATE> that <PERSON>Hirohito</PERSON> had cancer in his upper intestinal
area, but ``for various reasons'' did not announce it or tell the
monarch.
   Japanese doctors and family members often do not tell people they
have cancer as it is considered demoralizing and because of their
belief the disease is almost always fatal and the patient will
become discouraged.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Yomiuri Shimbun</ORGANIZATION> newspaper said it knew the emperor had cancer
long ago. ``This was not reported because the emperor himself had
not been informed of the true nature of his ailment,'' it said.
   Government spokesman <PERSON>Keizo Obuchi</PERSON> said the Cabinet decided
funeral costs will be shared by the government and <ORGANIZATION>Imperial
Household</ORGANIZATION>.
   Some opposition groups have warned government sponsorship of
funeral ceremonies, closely linked to <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s native Shinto
religion, could violate constitutional separation of religion and
state.
   Hirohito is the first emperor to die under <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s postwar
constitution. <PERSON>Obuchi</PERSON> said funeral ceremonies will be held at <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>'s
148-acre <ORGANIZATION>Shinjuku Gyoen Imperial Gardens</ORGANIZATION>. From there, his body will
be taken in procession to an imperial mausoleum in <LOCATION>Hachioji</LOCATION>, 28
miles away.
   A <ORGANIZATION>Foreign Ministry</ORGANIZATION> official said dignitaries from 130 nations are
expected for the ceremony where the <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON> will preside.
   More than 60 funeral and transition rites, some simple and some
complex, are expected in coming months. Akihito's coronation will be
delayed by a year's mourning, although he automatically became
emperor when <PERSON>Hirohito</PERSON> died.
   <PERSON>Obuchi</PERSON> said security is a major concern and, ``The minister of
home affairs ... said he wants to make sure there will not be any
guerrilla incidents.''
   Hirohito officially was commander in chief of the armed forces
during World War II, which was fought by the Japanese in his name.
Most historians agree he had no direct personal role in the war, but
critics say he should have prevented Japanese aggression.

   Prime Minister <PERSON>Toshiki Kaifu</PERSON> apologized today and
<PERSON>Emperor Akihito</PERSON> expressed ``deepest regret'' for <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s harsh
colonial rule over <LOCATION>Korea</LOCATION>, in statements designed to put the
nations' bitter past behind them.
   South Korean President <PERSON>Roh</PERSON> Tae-woo met Kaifu and the emperor on
the first day of a three-day state visit that is a carefully
scripted attempt by the two countries to move ahead as partners in
spreading peace and prosperity.
   For <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, which normalized relations with <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION> in <DATE>1965</DATE>,
the statements marked a breakthrough in acknowledging the suffering
it inflicted during its stifling 1910-1945 rule of <LOCATION>Korea</LOCATION>.
   At a state banquet, <PERSON>Roh</PERSON> said the two countries ``should strive
to remove the dark shadow of history,'' but <LOCATION>Koreans</LOCATION> had hoped for a
more direct apology from the emperor.
   In <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION>, thousands of radical students burned Japanese
flags and fought with police today. They shouted slogans that <PERSON>Roh</PERSON>'s
trip was a ``sellout to national pride.''
   Feelings still run high in <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION> over Japanese colonial
abuses. Koreans had to study Japanese in school and were taught to
worship the Japanese emperor. Koreans were drafted into the
Japanese army and into forced labor in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>. Hundreds of thousands
died in wartime service to <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>.
   Little of this is known in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> and the history is skimmed over
in schools. Lately, however, Japanese media have given crash
courses in Japan-Korea history with graphic photos and films of
Japanese atrocities.
   Security was heavy for <PERSON>Roh</PERSON>'s visit. About 20,000 police were
mobilized in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> to prevent attacks by rightist and leftist
extremists who threatened to disrupt the event. Protest rallies
were held in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>.
   After a 21-gun salute, <PERSON>Roh</PERSON> and his wife were received at <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>'s
official guest house by Emperor <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON>, <PERSON>Empress Michiko</PERSON>, <PERSON>Kaifu</PERSON> and
dozens of other Japanese officials and members of the imperial
family.
   Later, <PERSON>Kaifu</PERSON> delivered what <ORGANIZATION>Foreign Ministry</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>Taizo
Watanabe</PERSON> said was a stronger apology than any by previous prime
ministers and a more direct acknowledgement of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s
responsibility.
   Kaifu told <PERSON>Roh</PERSON> that <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION> must ``clearly and
honestly articulate the realities of events that have so
regrettably marred our past relations,'' <PERSON>Watanabe</PERSON> told reporters.
   Kaifu expressed his ``sincere remorse and honest apologies for
the fact that there was a period in our history in which <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s
action inflicted unbearable suffering and sorrow on the people of
the <LOCATION>Korean Peninsula</LOCATION>,'' <PERSON>Watanabe</PERSON> said.
   He quoted <PERSON>Roh</PERSON> as saying <PERSON>Kaifu</PERSON>'s statement ``reflects a correct
recognition of history.''
   <PERSON>Watanabe</PERSON> said the <LOCATION>Seoul</LOCATION> government had been informed in advance
of what the prime minister and the emperor would say.
   At the state banquet, attention was focused on the ``okotoba,''
the emperor's speech. The <LOCATION>Seoul</LOCATION> government had asked that <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON>
apologize for <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s actions in <LOCATION>Korea</LOCATION> and wanted him to state
<LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s responsibility.
   When <PERSON>Roh</PERSON>'s predecessor, <PERSON>Chun Doo-hwan</PERSON>, made the only previous
visit by a South Korean president in <DATE>1984</DATE>, the late Emperor
<PERSON>Hirohito</PERSON> left the <LOCATION>Koreans</LOCATION> dissatisfied with a vague statement
expressing regret about the ``unfortunate past'' between the two
countries.
   Akihito never used the word apology in his brief speech _
government officials will use that word in later meetings _ but he
made a point of quoting <PERSON>Hirohito</PERSON>'s words in <DATE>1984</DATE>, and he said more.
   Hirohito had said: ``It is indeed regrettable that there was an
unfortunate past between us for a period in this century and I
believe it should not be repeated again.''
   Akihito went on to say, ``I think of the sufferings your people
underwent during this unfortunate period, which was brought about
by my country, and cannot but feel the deepest regret.''
   He also praised <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION>'s economic advancement and said he
hoped the people of the two countries would together ``play
important roles for the peace and prosperity of the world.''
   In <LOCATION>Seoul</LOCATION>, officials indicated they were generally satisfied with
<PERSON>Akihito</PERSON>'s speech. Vice Foreign Minister <PERSON>Yoo Chong-ha</PERSON> said: ``I
think the Japanese government has made tremendous efforts to
satisfy our position.''
   In his reply, <PERSON>Roh</PERSON> said the ``dark period'' in relations between
the neighboring countries had been short, and it was time to put
``the unfortunate past truly behind us.''
   The 21st century will be the Asia-Pacific Age, he said, and
relations between the two countries would make a difference to the
wider world.
   ``For our nations ought to combine our efforts to take a leading
role in promoting peace and prosperity through the Asia-Pacific
region, an area which will become the cradle of a new civilization
harmoniously blending things East and West,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   For more than four decades, the bitter
memories of war and defeat clung to <PERSON>Emperor Hirohito</PERSON>. That same
ghost now haunts his son, <PERSON>Emperor Akihito</PERSON>, who on <DATE>Friday</DATE> paid
tribute to <LOCATION>Nagasaki</LOCATION>'s atomic bomb victims.
   About 3,800 people stood in steady rain as <LOCATION>Akihito</LOCATION>, accompanied
by <PERSON>Empress Michiko</PERSON>, became the first monarch to remember the
devastating <DATE>Aug. 9, 1945</DATE> attack at a monument to its 70,000 victims.
   The emperor bowed and placed a bouquet of white flowers on a
dark granite cenotaph before the Peace Park monument.
   The royal couple was greeted by loud yells of ``Banzai'' _ a
wish for long life _ when they arrived for the ceremony. And as
they left, some in the crowd sang ``<PERSON>Kimi Ga Yo</PERSON>,'' <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s
unofficial national anthem.
   The emperor and empress later visited a hospital for patients
suffering from illness related to the bombing.
   In a statement, <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON> said that seeing the park and hospital
``renewed my thoughts for peace ... and prayers for those who still
are in pain because of the bomb's effects.''
   In <LOCATION>Nagasaki</LOCATION>, that pain runs deep.
   ``I think he has helped heal some of the wounds by coming,''
said store clerk <PERSON>Sachiko Nagata</PERSON>, who was seven years old when the
bomb was dropped and now suffers from radiation sickness.
   ``But it took too long for him to come to this park,'' she said.
   Though the late <PERSON>Hirohito</PERSON> visited <LOCATION>Nagasaki</LOCATION> for a sporting event
in <DATE>1969</DATE>, his son, <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON>, is the first emperor to present flowers
at the Peace Park memorial.
   Mayor <PERSON>Hitoshi Motoshima</PERSON> was the emperor's guide on the first of
his four-day visit to southern <LOCATION>Kyushu Island</LOCATION>. Motoshima was shot in
<DATE>January</DATE> by an ultra-rightist for saying <PERSON>Hirohito</PERSON> bore some
responsibilty for the war.
   <PERSON>Motoshima</PERSON> made the comment at a city assembly meeting in
<DATE>December 1988</DATE>, as <PERSON>Hirohito</PERSON> lay dying of the cancer that ended his
life one month later.
   The mayor also said <PERSON>Hirohito</PERSON> could have helped end the war
sooner and saved <LOCATION>Nagasaki</LOCATION> from the atomic bomb. <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> surrendered
six days after the attack.
   Though many Japanese share <PERSON>Motoshima</PERSON>'s opinions, his candor
angered ultra-rightist groups. For more than a year, he received
death threats.
   Since the shooting, <PERSON>Motoshima</PERSON> has become a symbol of freedom of
speech.
   Though the mayor described <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON> as a ``wonderful human
being,'' he also said the monarch should strive to understand and
heal the wounds of the past.
   ``I hope the new emperor will reflect on why that war occured,
and use his position to further peace,'' <PERSON>Motoshima</PERSON> said <DATE>Friday</DATE>.
   Akihito's freedom to publicly reflect on the war will be tested
three days after his visit to <LOCATION>Nagasaki</LOCATION> ends, when he is to meet
South Korean President <PERSON>Roh</PERSON> Tae-woo in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>.
   The question of how, or even if, <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON> should apologize for
<LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s colonization of <LOCATION>Korea</LOCATION> from <DATE>1911</DATE> to the end of World War II
has become a major political issue between the neighbors.
   Though Prime Minister <PERSON>Toshiki Kaifu</PERSON> has said he plans to
apologize as the elected representative of the Japanese people,
several South Korean officials have reportedly demanded <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON>
make the apology.
   But many Japanese officials say such a ``political'' statement
by the emperor would violate the spirit of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s constitution,
which they say aims to limit imperial power by keeping the emperor
off the political stage.

   Emperor Akihito today began the most controversial
ceremony in his accession to the <LOCATION>Chrysanthemum Throne</LOCATION>, a communion
with the mythical sun goddess from whom legend says the imperial
line descended.
   The Shinto rite has been performed by most of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s monarchs
since at least the <DATE>seventh century</DATE>, and in the past was believed to
give monarchs their status as living gods.
   But protests were held across the country against the
state-funded rite, which has been criticized by many Japanese as
violating the constitution's separation of church and state.
   Hundreds of scholars in the north and labor unionists in the
west held peaceful demontrations, while hundreds of Christians
nationwide fasted.
   About 30,000 police were assigned to security in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> alone
because of the threat of violence by ultra-leftist radicals who
want to abolish the monarchy.
   As the ceremony began <TIME>this evening</TIME>, radicals fired six metal
projectiles from homemade mortar-like launchers at an imperial
villa in <LOCATION>Kyoto</LOCATION>, western <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, police said.
   Radicals were believed responsible for a fire that destroyed a
Shinto shrine in southern <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> today, police said. On <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>,
anti-monarchy radicals shoveled human waste from a truck near the
Imperial Palace.
   Akihito, 56, is the first Japanese emperor to be enthroned not
as a god-king but as a symbol of his people's sovereignty. But that
has not diminished the pomp and ceremony of his multimillion-dollar
coronation.
   Prime Minister <PERSON>Toshiki Kaifu</PERSON>, dressed in a swallow-tailed coat,
arrived at the palace this evening to attend the communion, one of
the final events surrounding the enthronement. Nearly 900 Japanese
dignitaries were expected to attend.
   Unlike <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON>'s formal state enthronement ceremony <DATE>Nov. 12</DATE> that
was viewed by foreign dignitaries representing 158 countries, no
foreigners were invited to the communion, which is to end before
dawn <DATE>Friday</DATE>.
   During the rite, called the Daijosai or <ORGANIZATION>Great Food Offering
Ritual</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON> offers rice, wine and other foods from around the
country to the sun goddess <ORGANIZATION>Amaterasu</ORGANIZATION>, from whom legend says the
imperial line descended.
   Only two female attendants, clad in white and red kimono and
with their hair tied in pony tails nearly 6{ feet long, witness the
Daijosai. The ceremony is held in the torch-lit inner sanctuary of
a specially built hall on the palace grounds. The rite is performed
only once by each emperor.
   Akihito, wearing his most holy white silk robes for the rite and
surrounded by court chamberlains, slowly proceeded to the
sanctuary, led by two attendants lighting the way with torches.
   Other attendants carried a large parasol over <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON>'s head, or
unrolled a rush mat before him. Yet another rolled up the mat
behind the emperor after each deliberate step.
   Inside the sanctuary, out of view of the 733 Japanese guests
seated in large tents nearby, the offerings were to be made to an
altar placed beside a stylized bed, from which the goddess is
summoned.
   Scholars before World War II theorized that at one time the
ceremony might have involved the emperor symbolically having sex
with the sun goddess, representing a union with the divine. Palace
officials, however, deny that theory and said the emperor would not
touch the bed.
   After the first communion <TIME>this evening</TIME>, the ceremony was to be
repeated after midnight in an identical hall located just yards
away from the first one. Haunting court music was to be played
throughout.
   Akihito, like his father, the late Emperor <PERSON>Hirohito</PERSON>, performs
dozens of religious ceremonies at the palace each year, carrying on
the priest-king role that has been handed down from ancient times.
   That role, however, has periodically come under fire since the
end of World War II, and opposition political parties, Christian
organizations and other groups claim the government is violation
the constitutional separation of church and state by spending an
estimated <MONEY>$17 million</MONEY> on the coronation rites.
   <PERSON>Hirohito</PERSON>, who died in <DATE>January 1989</DATE> at age 87, renounced the
concept of imperial divinity on New Year's <DATE>Day 1946</DATE>, at the urging
of the U.S.-led occupation forces. The country's post-war
constitution specifies that the emperor is a national symbol, and
not a god-king as tradition had had it.
   Critics say repeating the Shinto rites for <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON>'s
enthronement could encourage a return to the feverish
emperor-worship that helped lead the nation into war.

   In a solemn, centuries-old rite at the Imperial
Palace, <PERSON>Emperor Akihito</PERSON> acceded to the <LOCATION>Chrysanthemum Throne</LOCATION> on
<DATE>Monday</DATE>, becoming the first Japanese monarch enthroned as a symbol
and not a living god.
   Leftist radicals launched 25 separate attacks aimed at
disrupting the ceremony, police said. They fired missiles at five
military bases, including a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> naval base, and set fires at
religious shrines and train stations. None of the attacks caused
injuries.
   A massive national security operation involving thousands of
police was mounted to protect the ceremony and the scores of
visiting dignitaries.
   Akihito, wearing a red-brown silk kimono of ancient design, sat
on an elaborate lacquered throne in front of an Imperial Palace
courtyard filled with attendants carrying bows and swords.
   He vowed to uphold <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s modern constitution, which
fundamentally restructures the world's oldest hereditary monarchy.
   ``On this occasion, I pledge anew that I shall observe the
constitution of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> and discharge my duties as symbol of the
state and of the unity of the people,'' <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON>, speaking in
colloquial Japanese, told about 2,500 guests in the heavily guarded
palace.
   Seated on her own throne at <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON>'s side was <ORGANIZATION>Empress Michiko</ORGANIZATION>,
also dressed in full imperial regalia.
   Under the cloudless skies, gong and drum attendants played
haunting court music for royal family, officials and guests.
Dignitaries from 158 countries at the ceremony included Vice
President <PERSON>Dan Quayle</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s Prince <PERSON>Charles</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Princess
Diana</ORGANIZATION>.
   The ceremony ended with Prime Minister <PERSON>Toshiki Kaifu</PERSON>, dressed in
swallowtail coat, leading the Japanese guests in three cries of
``banzai!'' - a wish for long life. He led the cheers from a spot
level with the throne to underscore the constitution's emphasis on
popular sovereignty.
   Following the enthronement, <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON> and <PERSON>Empress Michiko</PERSON> were to
change into Western clothes and travel in an open car from the
Imperial Palace to the <LOCATION>Akasaka Palace</LOCATION>, three miles away. Officials
said nearly 10,000 police would line the route, which passes in
front of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s parliament.
   Akihito had begun his morning rituals by offering private
prayers at three wooden shrines inside the Imperial Palace to
announce his enthronement to the <ORGANIZATION>Sun Goddess</ORGANIZATION> and ancestors.
   Critics say the 30-minute ceremony - and a series of
accompanying rites to be held in coming weeks - are based too
closely on the traditional religious rituals used for <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON>'s
father and grandfather, who were enthroned as divinities.
   <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s postwar constitution stipulates that the emperor is
simply a national symbol.
   In one controversial element of the rite, <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON>'s raised dais
is said to be patterned after one used by the sun goddess, from
whom tradition says the Japanese imperial line is descended.
Critics say that is an implied symbol of divinity.
   The government is reportedly spending <MONEY>$95 million</MONEY> on the rites,
much of it for security. Opponents say state funding of the
ceremonies, linked to <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s indigenous Shinto religion, violates
the constitutional separation of religion and state.
   The radical left has been particularly incensed because of the
legacy of imperial militarism in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>.
   The projectiles were launched at three suburban bases of the
military and at a base in western <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>, police said. No damage was
reported.
   Another missile was fired outside the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> naval base at <LOCATION>Atsugi</LOCATION>,
24 miles southwest of <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>.
   Three train fires stopped service on two commuter lines, and in
separate incidents, two major subway lines were shut down because
of smoke.
   Among the other attacks police listed were fires that broke out
at four Shinto shrines in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>, including one less than a mile
from <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON>'s residence. Two shrines were destroyed.
   The attacks, including 19 in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>, caused little other damage,
police said.
   On <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, two bombs exploded at the house of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Consul
General <PERSON>Gregory L. Johnson</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Nishinomiya</LOCATION>, in western <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>. Police
said they caused little damage and no injuries. It was not
immediately clear whether the explosions were connected with the
enthronement.
   A record 37,000 police, including reinforcements from a majority
of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s 47 prefectures, have been mobilized for security
surrounding the rite. Security was particularly heavy around the
downtown palace.
   The government has not released the names of Japanese
dignitaries invited to the ceremony, because of fear of radical
attacks on their homes or businesses.
   Traffic was sharply restricted or halted along highways and in
areas around the palace, but few tie-ups were reported, in part
because enthronement day was declared a national holiday and many
Tokyoites took advantage of the three-day weekend to leave town.
Airlines reported many flights were booked close to capacity.
   Akihito became emperor immediately upon the death of his father,
Emperor <PERSON>Hirohito</PERSON>, in <DATE>January 1989</DATE>, but a period of mourning was
observed before his formal enthronement.
   Akihito, 56, was tutored after World War II by an American
pacifist, and is the first emperor in modern Japanese history to
marry a commoner. He and the empress also raised their three
children themselves, rather than have them raised separately by
aides, as was the imperial custom.
   As with <PERSON>Hirohito</PERSON>'s funeral, which was attended by
representatives of 164 nations, the enthronement provided
opportunity for a flurry of diplomatic meetings. Kaifu was
scheduled to meet with about 50 foreign officials.
   On <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>evening</TIME>, the first of seven banquets scheduled over
five days is to be held at the Imperial Palace, with senior
Japanese officials and foreign dignitaries attending.

   Former President <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> had lunch with <PERSON>Emperor
Akihito</PERSON> today and received one of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s top honors _ the Grand
Cordon of the Supreme Order of the Chrysanthemum _ for promoting
free trade and friendship with <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>.
   The award ceremony and luncheon at the Imperial Palace in
central <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> was the first meeting between the two men since
<PERSON>Akihito</PERSON> succeeded his father, the late <PERSON>Emperor Hirohito</PERSON>, in <DATE>January</DATE>
and since <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> retired to <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>.
   ``I am humbled and deeply honored to have been awarded,'' <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>
said.
   Akihito and <ORGANIZATION>Empress Michiko</ORGANIZATION> looked on as palace Grand Master of
Ceremonies <PERSON>Kiyoshi Sumiya</PERSON> presented the award to <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>, palace
officials said. <PERSON>Nancy Reagan</PERSON>, <PERSON>Crown Prince Naruhito</PERSON> and Ambassador
<PERSON>Michael Armacost</PERSON> also attended the ceremony and luncheon, they said
on condition of anonymity.
   The Reagans last met the imperial couple in <DATE>October 1987</DATE> when
they made an official visit to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>.
   Reagan received the award from the Japanese government for
promoting peace and friendship with <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> and for working to
protect the free trade system during his eight years in office,
officials said. The last and only other <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> president to receive
the honor was <PERSON>Dwight Eisenhower</PERSON>.
   Later in the day, <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>, who is in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> at the invitation of
<ORGANIZATION>Fujisankei Communications Group</ORGANIZATION> and the Japanese government, met
with Prime Minister <PERSON>Toshiki Kaifu</PERSON> and attended a dinner held by
<PERSON>Kaifu</PERSON> in his honor.
   At the dinner, <PERSON>Kaifu</PERSON> admired <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>'s popularity, noted the
deepening of bilateral relations during his years in office and
warmly congratulated <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> on his award.
   ``I know that over the years, every relationship has its ups and
downs. Even among the best of friends, there are sometimes issues
which need careful and candid evaluation,'' <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> said, alluding
to often rocky trade issues.
   <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> and Fujisankei have refused to confirm reports he will
receive about <MONEY>$2 million</MONEY> for his appearances on television and at
charitable events during his <DATE>Oct. 20-28</DATE> stay.
   Fujisankei, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s largest media group, has said it was
spending <MONEY>$7 million</MONEY> on the visit. On <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, the group sponsored a
gala benefit concert for the <ORGANIZATION>Ronald Reagan Presidential Library</ORGANIZATION>
attended by over 10,000 people.
   Like its chairman, <PERSON>Nobutaka Shikanai</PERSON>, many of Fujisankei's media
outlets espouse conservatism and nationalism.
   At the time of <PERSON>Hirohito</PERSON>'s death on <DATE>Jan. 7</DATE>, the Fuji TV network
generally carried less critical views of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s imperial system.

   Emperor <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON> and his mother, the empress
dowager, will be the only heirs of the late <PERSON>Emperor Hirohito</PERSON> in
order to keep together the royal treasures, news reports said <DATE>today</DATE>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Kyodo News Service</ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION>Imperial Household Agency</ORGANIZATION> asked nine
other imperial successors to waive their rights of inheritance.
   The palace declined comment, however, saying a public
announcement now would be premature.
   Hirohito, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s emperor for 62 years, died <DATE>Jan. 7</DATE> at age 87.
Akihito, his eldest son, succeeded him and <PERSON>Hirohito</PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON>Nagako</PERSON>,
became empress dowager.
   Under Japanese law, legal heirs to property must claim their
inheritance within six months of the owner's death. This would mean
by <DATE>July 7</DATE> in <PERSON>Hirohito</PERSON>'s case, and the tax administration office
must announce the claims within four months.
   It will be the first public accounting of the imperial family's
private finances since shortly after World War II. The government
reported then that the imperial family's wealth amounted to the
equivalent of about <MONEY>$113,000</MONEY>.
   Such things as three sacred treasures _ a mirror, sword and
jewels handed down from emperor to emperor _ are tax-exempt, and
the family owns no land. But bank savings, stocks and bonds under
<PERSON>Hirohito</PERSON>'s name and paintings are subject to inheritance taxes.
   Kyodo said the palace will donate the art works to the
government and continue to use them as government-owned imperial
property. The land where the imperial family lives is owned by the
government.
   The imperial family, formerly exempt from taxes, was the
wealthiest family in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> until <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> forces occupying this country
after the war forced it to give up most of its property. Its
wealth, including real estate, stocks and bonds, reportedly
amounted to about <MONEY>$29 million</MONEY> before it surrendered most of its
holdings to the government.

   Emperor Akihito formally assumed the <LOCATION>Chrysanthemum
Throne</LOCATION> on <DATE>Monday</DATE> in rites steeped in ancient tradition but
reflecting the U.S.-imposed postwar constitution that denies him
the divine status of his predecessors.
   Despite massive security precautions, leftist extremists opposed
to the monarchy launched attacks on military bases, train stations
and Shinto shrines as the late <PERSON>Emperor Hirohito</PERSON>'s son assumed the
throne, which is said to date from 660 <ORGANIZATION>B.C.
   Police</ORGANIZATION> counted more than 32 guerrilla incidents <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME>,
most in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>. None of the attacks appeared to cause injuries, but
they disrupted several train lines, and a bomb exploded near a
police dormitory, setting two empty houses on fire, police said.
   Akihito, wearing a red-brown silk kimono of ancient design, sat
on an elaborate lacquered throne in front of an Imperial Palace
courtyard filled with attendants carrying bows and swords.
   He vowed to uphold <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s modern constitution, which
fundamentally restructures the world's oldest hereditary monarchy.
   ``On this occasion, I pledge anew that I shall observe the
constitution of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> and discharge my duties as symbol of the
state and of the unity of the people,'' <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON>, speaking in
colloquial Japanese, told about 2,500 guests in the heavily guarded
palace.
   Seated on her own throne at <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON>'s side was <ORGANIZATION>Empress Michiko</ORGANIZATION>,
also dressed in full imperial regalia.
   Under the cloudless skies, gong and drum attendants played
haunting court music for royal family, officials and guests.
Dignitaries from 158 countries at the ceremony included Vice
President <PERSON>Dan Quayle</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s Prince <PERSON>Charles</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Princess
Diana</ORGANIZATION>.
   Akihito expressed deep ``love and respect'' for his father, who
died in <DATE>January 1989</DATE> after a 62-year reign that encompassed <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s
crushing defeat in World War II and spectacular rise as the world's
No. 2 economic power.
   Hirohito had renounced his divine status after the war. Under
the new constitution, <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON> becomes the first of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s 125
emperors, including those listed only in legend, to take the throne
as a mere mortal and not a priest-king.
   The ceremony ended with Prime Minister <PERSON>Toshiki Kaifu</PERSON>, wearing a
morning suit instead of traditional garb, leading the Japanese
guests in three cries of ``banzai!'' - a wish for long life.
   He led the cheers from a spot level with the throne to
underscore the constitution's emphasis on popular sovereignty.
   Earlier <DATE>Monday</DATE>, <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON> had announced his ascension to the sun
goddess and his ancestors in private prayers at wooden shrines
inside the palace.
   A blimp floated overhead with a huge sign urging <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> residents
to call with any information about suspected terrorist activity.
   Following the enthronement, <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON> and <PERSON>Empress Michiko</PERSON> were to
change into Western clothes and travel in an open car to the
<LOCATION>Akasaka Palace</LOCATION>, three miles away. Officials said nearly 10,000
police would line the route, which passes in front of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s
parliament.
   But many Japanese were ignoring the ceremonies, taking advantage
of the special holiday to take weekend trips and crowd golf courses
and driving ranges. One poll indicated nearly half of the Japanese
were not interested in the enthronement.
   A record 37,000 police, many dressed in full riot gear and
backed by water cannon, were deployed in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> to guard the
ceremonies but could not stop a series of attacks throughout the
city.
   Radicals launched projectiles at three suburban military bases
and a fourth in western <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Defense Agency</ORGANIZATION> reported. Police
reported a similar attack outside the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> naval base at <LOCATION>Atsugi</LOCATION>, 25
miles southwest of <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>.
   Radicals also were accused of setting early morning fires at
three <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> train stations that stopped traffic on two major
commuter lines, police reported.
   Fires erupted at four Shinto shrines in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>, including one
less than a mile from <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON>'s residence, destroying two.
   Radicals and other critics say the coronation and its
accompanying rites are based too closely on the traditional
religious rituals used for <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON>'s father, whose name was invoked
by the militarists who launched the Pacific War.
   Opponents say state funding of the ceremonies, linked to <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s
indigenous Shinto religion, violates the constitutional separation
of religion and state.
   Akihito became emperor immediately upon the death of his father,
but a period of mourning was observed before his enthronement.
   As with <PERSON>Hirohito</PERSON>'s funeral, which was attended by
representatives of 164 nations, the enthronement provided
opportunity for a flurry of diplomatic meetings. Kaifu was
scheduled to meet with about 50 foreign officials.
   The government is reportedly spending <MONEY>$95 million</MONEY> on the rites,
much of it for security.
   Akihito, 56, was tutored after World War II by an American
pacifist, and is the first emperor in modern Japanese history to
marry a commoner.
   He and the empress also raised their three children themselves,
rather than have them raised separately by aides, as was the
imperial custom.

   Emperor <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON> ascended to the world's oldest
hereditary monarchy today, the first in a legendary 2,600-year-old
line of emperors to be enthroned as a national symbol rather than a
living god.
   Leftist extremists, who consider the institution of emperor an
unconstitutional relic of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s militarist past, attacked
military bases, train stations and Shinto shrines in protest.
   Police counted at least 34 guerrilla attacks timed to coincide
with the coronation of the late Emperor <PERSON>Hirohito</PERSON>'s 56-year-old son.
None appeared to cause any injuries.
   A record 37,000 police had been mobilized to guard the
ceremonies as well as the attending dignitaries from 158 countries,
including Vice President <PERSON>Dan Quayle</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s Prince <PERSON>Charles</PERSON>
and <ORGANIZATION>Princess Diana</ORGANIZATION>.
   For his coronation, <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON> wore a red-brown silk kimono and hat
of ancient design and sat on an elaborate lacquered throne in front
of an Imperial Palace courtyard filled with attendants carrying
bows and swords.
   He vowed to ``discharge my duties as symbol of the state and of
the unity of the people'' under <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s postwar constitution, which
fundamentally restructured the monarchy.
   Hirohito had renounced his divine status after the war, but
<PERSON>Akihito</PERSON> becomes the first of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s 125 emperors, including those
listed only in legend, to take the throne as a mere mortal and not
a priest-king.
   He said he would perform his role in the same spirit as his
father, who ``shared joys and sorrows with the people at all
times'' during a 62-year reign that encompassed both the
devastation of World War II and <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s dramatic recovery.
   Empress Michiko, dressed in a multicolored gown, her face
painted white, sat motionless on her own throne at <LOCATION>Akihito</LOCATION>'s side
throughout the 30-minute ceremony.
   The ritual ended with Prime Minister <PERSON>Toshiki Kaifu</PERSON> standing
stiffly before <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON> in a morning suit and leading the Japanese
guests in three cries of ``Banzai'' - he traditional wish for long
life.
   He led the cheers from a point level with the base of the
throne, to underscore the constitution's stress on popular
sovereignty.
   A 21-gun salute blasted from an adjacent park.
   The ancient, mystical enthronement rites are said to date back
to 660 B.C.
   <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Empress Michiko</ORGANIZATION> later left the palace grounds in an
open Rolls <PERSON>Royce</PERSON>, ringed by dozens of police motorcycles and waving
and smiling to cheering crowds. They had changed to formal Western
clothes.
   Many of the estimated 110,000 people along the three-mile parade
route to <ORGANIZATION>Akasaka Palace</ORGANIZATION>, the couple's home, yelled ``Banzai'' and
waved national flags as the 44-car parade passed. Nearly 10,000
police lined the route.
   There was one shaky moment, however, when firecrackers popped as
the emperor's car passed by. Police with German shepherds rushed in
and arrested several people, some of whom handed out leaflets
calling <PERSON>Hirohito</PERSON> a war criminal.
   Leftist radicals who want the imperial house abolished made
themselves heard all across the capital. Police said they arrested
about a dozen of the several thousand protesters who held
anti-imperial rallies around <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>.
   In one park, hundreds of masked members of the ultra-leftist
Chukakuha, or Middle Core Faction, chanted ``Smash the enthronement
ceremony!''
   One man attempted to commit hara-kiri, or traditional suicide by
disembowelment, in front of the Imperial Palace but was rushed to a
hospital, police said. There were no immediate details on his
condition or motivation.
   Radicals launched projectiles at three suburban military bases
and a fourth in western <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Defense Agency</ORGANIZATION> reported. Police
reported another attack outside the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> naval base at <LOCATION>Atsugi</LOCATION>, 24
miles southwest of <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>.
   Radicals also were accused of setting early morning fires at
three <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> train stations that stopped traffic on two major
commuter lines, police reported.
   Fires erupted at four Shinto shrines in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>, including one
less than a mile from <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON>'s residence, destroying two.
   Japanese flags lined the main streets in the <LOCATION>Ginza</LOCATION> shopping
district, where cars and trucks painted with rightist slogans
paraded. Speakers blared ``Long live the emperor,'' as riot police
stood by.
   But many Japanese were ignoring the ceremonies, taking advantage
of the special holiday to take weekend trips and crowd golf courses
and driving ranges. Long lines of people queued in front of movie
theaters.
   One poll indicated nearly half of the Japanese were not
interested in the enthronement.
   Akihito became emperor immediately after the death of <PERSON>Hirohito</PERSON>
in <DATE>January 1989</DATE>, but his enthronement was delayed until after a
period of mourning.

<HEAD>President Roh Seeks Trip to Japan Despite Diplomatic Row</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President <PERSON>Roh</PERSON> Tae-woo will push ahead
with his scheduled visit to <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, his office said <DATE>today</DATE>, despite
an escalating diplomatic row over <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s apology for its colonial
rule of <LOCATION>Korea</LOCATION>.
   <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION>, however, may develop some retaliatory measures if
<LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> rejects its demand for a clear-cut apology for wrongs
committed under <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s 1910-45 rule, presidential spokesman <PERSON>Lee
Soo-jung</PERSON> said. He did not elaborate.
   Roh has been under public pressure to call off his trip next
week to <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>, following controversial remarks by Japanese
governing party leaders asking Japanese Emperor <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON> not to make
an open, strong apology. But <PERSON>Lee</PERSON> said the president would not
reconsider the three-day visit, beginning <DATE>May 24</DATE>.
   Japanese Prime Minister <PERSON>Toshiki Kaifu</PERSON> said <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> he plans to
apologize to <PERSON>Roh</PERSON> about the colonial rule but would not say whether
the emperor should.
   Elderly Koreans have staged daily protests outside the <ORGANIZATION>Japanese
Embassy</ORGANIZATION> to demand an apology and compensation for <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s wartime
acts. The protesters, many related to <LOCATION>Koreans</LOCATION> who were killed
during World War II, have asked <PERSON>Roh</PERSON> to cancel his visit. During the
war, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> drafted hundreds of thousands of <LOCATION>Koreans</LOCATION> as soldiers and
forced laborers.
   ``<LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, the war criminal, must apologize, compensate,'' a dozen
protesters shouted today during a sit-in outside the embassy, which
was guarded by riot troopers wearing helmets and carrying shields.
Police did not intervene.
   The matter is delicate for the Japanese, touching on the nature
of the emperor's role under the postwar constitution and recalling
unresolved questions about how much responsibility the late Emperor
<PERSON>Hirohito</PERSON> had for <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s wartime actions.
   Akihito succeeded to the throne after <PERSON>Hirohito</PERSON> died in <DATE>January
1989</DATE>.
   Roh's trip had been delayed twice by issues involving the legal
status of some 700,000 ethnic Koreans living in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>. <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> agreed
early this month to provide greater legal protection for <LOCATION>Koreans</LOCATION>.

   In <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s clearest effort to grapple with its
militaristic past, <PERSON>Emperor Akihito</PERSON> and Prime Minister <PERSON>Toshiki Kaifu</PERSON>
on <DATE>Thursday</DATE> acknowledged the suffering that Japanese colonial rule
inflicted on <LOCATION>Koreans</LOCATION>.
   The apology come 45 years after a defeated <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> relinquished
its control of the Korean peninsula. The issue of acknowledging
<LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s past exposed bitter memories in both countries, prompting
demonstrations and arson attacks.
   In a palace banquet for visiting South Korean President <PERSON>Roh
Tae-woo</PERSON>, <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON> went beyond a previous imperial statement and said
he felt the ``deepest regret'' for the pain <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s colonial rule
caused the Korean people. Earlier <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, <PERSON>Kaifu</PERSON> expressed
``sincere remorse and honest apologies'' for Japanese actions that
``inflicted unbearable suffering and sorrow on the people of the
Korean peninsula.''
   Kaifu's apology was the most clear-cut ever by a Japanese prime
minister, <ORGANIZATION>Foreign Ministry</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>Taizo Watanabe</PERSON> said. A similar
statement of remorse also was expected to be made by <ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION>,
where <PERSON>Roh</PERSON> was to give an address <DATE>Friday</DATE>.
   For <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, which normalized relations with <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION> in <DATE>1965</DATE>,
the statements marked a breakthrough in acknowledging the suffering
it inflicted during its 1910-1945 rule of <LOCATION>Korea</LOCATION>. The lack of an
explicit apology had been a major obstacle to improving the two
neighbors' relations.
   Roh, replying to <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON>, said the ``dark period'' in
Japanese-Korean relations had been short and it was time to put
``the unfortunate past truly behind us.''
   In <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION>, thousands of radical students burned Japanese
flags and fought with police <DATE>Thursday</DATE>. They shouted slogans that
<PERSON>Roh</PERSON>'s trip to <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> _ only the second by a South Korean head of
state _ was a ``sellout to national pride.''
   Under colonial rule, <LOCATION>Koreans</LOCATION> had to study Japanese in school and
were taught to worship the Japanese emperor. Koreans were drafted
into the Japanese army and into forced labor in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>. Hundreds of
thousands died in wartime service to <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>.
   Little of this is known in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, and the history is skimmed
over in schools. Lately, however, Japanese media have given crash
courses in Japan-Korea history with graphic photos and films of
Japanese atrocities.
   Before the trip, <PERSON>Kaifu</PERSON> had offered to make a strong statement,
but <LOCATION>South Koreans</LOCATION> sought a personal apology from <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON> because
<LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s military adventures in the early part of this century often
were made in the name of his father, the late Emperor <PERSON>Hirohito</PERSON>.
   The demands sparked a debate within <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s government over
whether a strong apology by the emperor would violate
constitutional restraints on his political role.
   In a carefully orchestrated compromise, both governments seemed
to hope that whatever was lacking in the Akihito statement would be
made up for by <PERSON>Kaifu</PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION>.
   Akihito quoted the words <PERSON>Hirohito</PERSON> used in <DATE>1984</DATE> during the state
visit of <PERSON>Roh</PERSON>'s predecessor, Chun Doo-hwan: ``It is indeed
regrettable that there was an unfortunate past between us for a
period in this century, and I believe it should not be repeated
again.''
   That statement, the closest <PERSON>Hirohito</PERSON> ever came to a public
apology, was strongly criticized in <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION> as being too vague
and for not saying who was to blame.
   But <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON> went on to say: ``I think of the sufferings your
people underwent during this unfortunate period, which was brought
about by my country, and cannot but feel the deepest regret.''
   Underscoring the importance of <PERSON>Roh</PERSON>'s visit, the 150-guest
banquet was the largest at the palace since <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON> assumed the
throne after his father's death. Akihito broke with tradition by
welcoming <PERSON>Roh</PERSON> outside the banquet hall. As they entered the hall,
musicians played ``Hand in Hand,'' theme song of the <DATE>1988</DATE> Seoul
Olympics.
   Foreign Minister <PERSON>Choi Ho-jung</PERSON>, who accompanied <PERSON>Roh</PERSON> to <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>,
indicated that <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s apology fell short of <LOCATION>Seoul</LOCATION>'s expectations
but said he believed <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> did ``its best to receive President <PERSON>Roh</PERSON>
with courtesy.''
   Extreme leftists vowed to disrupt the visit, which they call the
first step toward reviving the militarist Japanese empire.
Rightists, who worship the emperor, have strongly opposed calls for
Akihito to apologize.
   Police mobilized 20,000 officers to guard against radical
attacks. Though they said about 300 leftist radicals demonstrated
in two separate <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> rallies, no arrests or incidents were
reported.

  [Text] <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>, <DATE>March 24</DATE> KYODO -- South Korean President <PERSON>Kim 
Yong-sam</PERSON> on <DATE>Thursday</DATE> [24 <DATE>March</DATE>] officially invited <PERSON>Emperor 
Akihito</PERSON> and Empress Michiko to visit <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION> to forge a new 
future-oriented relationship, the <ORGANIZATION>Imperial Household Agency</ORGANIZATION> 
said. "I would like to promote relations between <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION> 
and <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> from a forward-looking, future-oriented view," a 
senior <ORGANIZATION>Imperial Palace</ORGANIZATION> official quoted Kim as saying. 
  Bilateral relations are still overshadowed by <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s 
colonial rule of the Korean peninsula from <DATE>1910</DATE> to <DATE>1945</DATE>, and 
anti-Japanese sentiment continues to run high. 
  Kim and his wife, Son Myong-sun, had a 25-minute audience 
with the imperial couple in an "overall pleasant atmosphere," 
<PERSON>Kiyoshi Sumiya</PERSON>, grand master of ceremonies, said. 
  "I think it would benefit our friendly neighborly relations 
if we could welcome the emperor and the empress in <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION>. 
I would like to seize this good opportunity to offer an 
invitation," <PERSON>Kim</PERSON> told the imperial couple. 
  The emperor replied it is the Japanese Government's decision 
on whether he goes abroad. 
  In an interview ahead of the visit, <PERSON>Kim</PERSON>, who was elected 
last 
year to a single five-year term, said he believes he will be 
able to receive the emperor in <LOCATION>Seoul</LOCATION> during his term in office. 
  The emperor told Kim it is important that both nations 
deepen 
their exchange while reflecting on history and respecting each 
other's cultures. 
  During colonization, <LOCATION>Koreans</LOCATION> were forbidden from speaking 
Korean in public and had to adopt Japanese names. In addition, 
<LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s forced recruitment of tens of thousands of Korean women 
for wartime military brothels has refueled bitter memories.

  [Text] <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>, <DATE>May 4</DATE> KYODO -- Japanese Prime Minister 
<PERSON>Tsutomu Hata</PERSON> and French President <PERSON>Francois Mitterrand</PERSON> agreed 
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE> [4 May] that <LOCATION>North Korea</LOCATION>'s suspected nuclear weapons 
program threatens the global move toward preventing the spread 
of nuclear weapons to non-nuclear powers. 
  The two leaders shared the understanding during a two-hour 
meeting at the French Presidential Palace, Japanese officials 
said. 
  The meeting took place after Hata arrived in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> from <LOCATION>Rome</LOCATION> 
as part of his European tour, which will also take him to 
<LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Belgium</LOCATION>. 
  They said <PERSON>Hata</PERSON> told <PERSON>Mitterrand</PERSON> that the North Korean nuclear 
issue "is a serious problem that threatens the nuclear 
nonproliferation regime, as well as undermines the security of 
the Asia-Pacific region." 
  Hata also said, "we must counter the threat in solidarity, 
while keeping the channels for (diplomatic) dialogue open." 
  Mitterrand agreed with Hata's view, the Japanese officials 
said. 
  On <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Hata</PERSON> told <PERSON>Mitterrand</PERSON>, "it is important for <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> 
to 
provide greater transparency in its activities in the military 
field...and it is crucial for us to urge <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> to demonstrate a 
positive response in the field of human rights." 
  Hata also told <PERSON>Mitterrand</PERSON>, "<LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> wants to step up its 
cooperation with <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> in various fields from now on" to build 
a new international order to secure global peace in addition to 
strengthening the capabilities of the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION>, the 
officials said. 
  Mitterrand replied, "I agree with your view. The two nations 
can build up a stronger relationship of cooperation." 
  The French president expressed his interest in enhancing 
cooperation, particularly in extending economic assistance to 
such areas as <LOCATION>Indochina</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>. 
  Hata expressed gratitude for <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>'s endorsement for 
<LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s 
bid to secure a permanent seat on the <ORGANIZATION>UN Security Council</ORGANIZATION>, of 
which <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> is one of the five permanent members. 
  French Foreign Minister <PERSON>Alain Juppe</PERSON> expressed his support 
for 
<LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s bid for permanent membership on the <ORGANIZATION>UN</ORGANIZATION> decision-making 
body during his visit to <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> in <DATE>March</DATE>. 
  Mitterrand, however, stopped short of addressing the issue, 
according to the Japanese officials. 
  The French leader expressed his nation's readiness to 
welcome 
Japanese Emperor <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON> and his wife <PERSON>Michiko</PERSON>, who are slated to 
visit <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> in <DATE>October</DATE>. 
  "We are looking forward to meeting the emperor and empress," 
the president was quoted as saying. 
  Hata replied, "the emperor is also looking forward to the 
visit." The royal couple is slated to visit <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> on 
a two-week trip that will begin in late <DATE>September</DATE>.

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President <PERSON>Roh Tae-woo</PERSON> said <DATE>Saturday</DATE>
that <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s apologies for its brutal colonial rule might not
satisfy all <LOCATION>South Koreans</LOCATION>, but he urged them to look to the future,
not the past.
   Roh returned from an emotional three-day visit to <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> aimed at
beginning a new partnership between the Asian neighbors. At its
conclusion, he invited <PERSON>Emperor Akihito</PERSON> to make the first Japanese
imperial visit to <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION>.
   During <PERSON>Roh</PERSON>'s visit, <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON> expressed ``deepest regret for the
sufferings and pain'' <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> inflicted on <LOCATION>Korea</LOCATION> during its colonial
rule from <DATE>1910</DATE> to <DATE>1945</DATE>. Japanese Prime Minister <PERSON>Toshiki Kaifu</PERSON>
extended his ``sincere remorse and honest apologies.''
   Kaifu's apology was <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s clearest statement of regret ever
over its military past. But <PERSON>Roh</PERSON> acknowledged many <LOCATION>South Koreans</LOCATION>
would be dissatisfied with it.
   ``I well understand what feelings my fellow countrymen have
about what went on between our country and <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> in the past. No
amount of apology can be fully satisfactory,'' <PERSON>Roh</PERSON> said at a news
conference at <LOCATION>Seoul</LOCATION>'s airport.
   During much of the colonial period, <LOCATION>Koreans</LOCATION> were forced to speak
Japanese, use Japanese names and worship the late Japanese Emperor
<PERSON>Hirohito</PERSON>, <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON>'s father. Many <LOCATION>Koreans</LOCATION> died after being
conscripted into <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s army or in dangerous jobs as laborers in
<LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>.
   Before leaving <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> on <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, <PERSON>Roh</PERSON> said <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON>'s words of
regret ``were very significant,'' and said the emperor and <PERSON>Kaifu</PERSON>
had ``expressed a common awareness about this unfortunate period
between our two countries.''
   ``With this, I feel that myself and the people of my country
feel we can put the unfortunate period of our history behind us,''
<PERSON>Roh</PERSON> said.
   In <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>, about 20,000 police had been mobilized to guard
against threats to <PERSON>Roh</PERSON> from both rightist and leftist groups, but
no incidents were reported.
   During a brief visit to <LOCATION>Osaka</LOCATION> in western <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> on his way home,
about 30 leftists demonstrated peacefully against <PERSON>Roh</PERSON>'s visit,
police said.
   Roh's visit had sparked far bigger protests in <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION>.
Before he left for <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, radicals and human rights groups
demonstrated almost daily, demanding that he cancel his visit.
   One man slashed his belly with a knife in front of the <ORGANIZATION>Japanese
Embassy</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Seoul</LOCATION> in protest.
   <PERSON>Roh</PERSON> said after his return that he believed <PERSON>Kaifu</PERSON>'s and <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON>'s
statements of regret were sufficient and urged that they be
accepted.
   ``Even if we may feel that the Japanese apologies do not fully
live up to our expectations, we should accept them with magnanimity
and generosity now that <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> has forthrightly admitted its
mistakes, reflected on them and apologized,'' he said.
   ``With that, I believe we must now forge a new era of
neighborliness and friendship,'' he added.
   Some sore points remain unresolved, including discrimination
against Korean residents in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> and health care for Korean
survivors of the atomic bombings of <LOCATION>Hiroshima</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Nagasaki</LOCATION>.
   Roh made clear that he had asked <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> to move forward on those
issues, but he said he was satisfied with the progress so far.
   ``If we are to promote the peace and prosperity of northeast
<LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> and also usher in an Asian-Pacific age by the <DATE>21st century</DATE>, we
should advance friendly cooperation with <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, our next-door
neighbor,'' he said.

  [Text] <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION>, <DATE>March 20</DATE> (XINHUA) -- Chinese President 
<PERSON>Jiang Zemin</PERSON> and Vice Premier <PERSON>Zhu Rongji</PERSON> had separate discussions 
with visiting Japanese Prime Minister <PERSON>Morihiro Hosokawa</PERSON> on 
furthering Sino-Japanese relations and other issues here today. 
  According to a <ORGANIZATION>Chinese Foreign Ministry</ORGANIZATION> spokesman, <PERSON>Jiang</PERSON> 
praised Hosokawa for focusing seriously on bilateral ties and 
for actively promoting Sino-Japanese friendship. He also 
expressed the conviction that <ORGANIZATION>Hosokawa</ORGANIZATION>'s visit will be useful in 
enhancing the bilateral ties. 
  He noted that the rapidly developing Sino-Japanese ties over 
the past 22 years following the normalization of diplomatic 
relations between the two countries have entered into a new 
period of "all-round development." 
  <PERSON>Jiang</PERSON> said that <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> have their own strong and 
weak points; therefore they are partners in cooperation. "So 
long as the leaders of our two countries have a clear 
understanding on this, the two sides can surely foster a long 
and sustained relationship of mutually beneficial cooperation," 
he stressed. 
  He also believed that it is a historical trend for <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and 
<LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> to live in peace from generation to generation. 
  Discussing international issues, <PERSON>Jiang</PERSON> said that under the 
turbulent international situation of <DATE>today</DATE>, a rare chance has 
emerged in <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION>, which now enjoys relative stability and fast 
economic development. 
  He continued that as the <DATE>20th century</DATE> is approaching to an 
end, the leaders of the Asian countries must answer a question 
of major importance, namely, what kind of <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> will they take 
into the <DATE>21st century</DATE>. 
  <PERSON>Jiang</PERSON> said that the Chinese leaders, while concentrating on 
domestic issues, will foster better coordination and cooperation 
with <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>. 
  <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> and other Asian countries should make joint 
efforts to keep long-term stability in the continent and to 
establish a new international order under which countries, big 
or small, rich or poor, can live in peace and deal with each 
other on an equal footing, <PERSON>Jiang</PERSON> said. 
  This is <LOCATION>Hosokawa</LOCATION>'s second meeting with <PERSON>Jiang</PERSON>, following 
their 
meeting in <LOCATION>Seattle</LOCATION> <DATE>last November</DATE>. 
  Hosokawa told <PERSON>Jiang</PERSON> that his meetings with Premier <PERSON>Li Peng</PERSON> 
and Vice Premier <PERSON>Zhu Rongji</PERSON> show that the two sides have 
identical or similar views on many issues. 
  He said that he was confident that <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> will 
build 
a forward-looking relationship of long-term and stable 
cooperation. 
  Hosokawa conveyed the Japanese emperor's invitation for 
<PERSON>Jiang</PERSON> 
to visit <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>. Jiang thanked the emperor and asked Hosokawa to 
convey his good wishes to the emperor and empress. 
  Zhu <PERSON>Rongji</PERSON> met with <PERSON>Hosokawa</PERSON> and his wife and hosted a 
luncheon in their honor earlier today, thanking the Japanese 
Government and people for their hospitality accorded him during 
his recent visit to <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>. 
  Hosokawa said that he was very pleased to meet Zhu again.

<TEXT>
   <LOCATION>WASHINGTON</LOCATION> _ President <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> mourned the death of <PERSON>Emperor
Hirohito</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, saying he played ``a truly heroic role'' in
ending World War II hostilities between his country and the <LOCATION>United
States</LOCATION>.
   ``On behalf of the people and government of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, we
extend our deepest condolences to His Imperial Majesty, the Emperor,
to the Imperial family, and to the People of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>,'' the president
said in a statement released by the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> shortly after the
annoucement of the emperor's death <DATE>Friday</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> said the emperor's 62-year reign ``spanned one of the most
tumultuous, and yet at the same time constructive eras in the
history of mankind _ an age of unprecedented economic collapse, a
most vicious war, astonishing scientific acheivement, and dramatic
political and social changes throughout the world.''
   ``It was also an era of unprecedented reconciliation. His majesty
played a truly heroic role in bringing hostilities between our two
peoples to an end and leading the Japanese people through a period
of reconstruction and reconciliation that has resulted in both the
prosperity the Japanese know today and in the close relations our
two nations and peoples now enjoy,'' <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> said.
   The president recalled the late emperor had visited the <LOCATION>United
States</LOCATION> in <DATE>1975</DATE>, and that he and his wife <PERSON>Nancy</PERSON> had ``enjoyed several
meetings with him, most recently in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>'' in <DATE>1986</DATE>. The statement
also noted the first couple had entertained the former Crown Prince
<PERSON>Akihito</PERSON> and <PERSON>Crown Princess Michiko</PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1987</DATE>.
   ``While we mourn the passing of His majesty, we shall long
remember him for his contributions which strengthened the <ORGANIZATION>United
States-Japan</ORGANIZATION> relationship and set a future course of continued close
and friendly relations,'' the president said.
   Presidential spokesman <PERSON>Marlin Fitzwater</PERSON> said that because there
will be a waiting period before <PERSON>Hirohito</PERSON>'s funeral, the decision on
whom to send would be up to the incoming administration of <PERSON>George
Bush</PERSON>.
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> sent letters of condolence to both <PERSON>Hirohito</PERSON>'s son, <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON>,
and the prime minister of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Noboru Takeshita</PERSON>, said <PERSON>Sean Walsh</PERSON>,
a press aide in the vice president's office.
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> met the late emperor once on a <DATE>1982</DATE> visit to <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>. Akahito
visited <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> at his home during a trip to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> last
year. The two played tennis together on that occasion.
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s office did not release the text of the letters. <PERSON>Walsh</PERSON> said
<PERSON>Bush</PERSON> conveyed ``his sincerest condolences'' to Akahito on the death
of his father, and expressed similar sentiments in the letter to the
prime minister.

   <PERSON>Kiko Kawashima</PERSON> is a college student living in a
small apartment with her parents, but come <DATE>Friday</DATE>, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s
modern-day Cinderella will call a palace her home.
   In <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s first royal wedding in six years, the 23-year-old
<PERSON>Miss Kawashima</PERSON> is to wed <PERSON>Emperor Akihito</PERSON>'s youngest son, <PERSON>Prince
Aya</PERSON>, who is 24 and second in line to the <LOCATION>Chrysanthemum Throne</LOCATION>.
   The wedding will be lavish _ the government has allotted nearly
<MONEY>$1 million</MONEY> _ and filled with traditions dating back more than 1,000
years.
   But to a nation that only last year buried <PERSON>Emperor Hirohito</PERSON>,
whose 62-year reign spanned a turbulent period of militarist
expansionism and economic reconstruction, the wedding also is being
hailed as the first taste of a new era.
   As far as the clearly smitten Japanese media are concerned,
Prince Aya could not have chosen a better mate than ``Kiko-san,''
who is only the second commoner to marry into the imperial family.
   Aya's mother, <PERSON>Empress Michiko</PERSON>, became the first in <DATE>1959</DATE> when she
married <PERSON>Emperor Akihito</PERSON>, who was then crown prince. Akihito
ascended the throne immediately after <PERSON>Hirohito</PERSON>'s death on <DATE>Jan. 7,
1989</DATE>.
   Most of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s major television networks will broadcast live
coverage of the ceremony and related events. The wedding is
scheduled to begin at <TIME>10 a.m.</TIME> and will be followed by several other
ceremonies, so television coverage will likely last well into the
<TIME>night</TIME>.
   Along with the countless comparisons to <LOCATION>Cinderella</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Miss
Kawashima</LOCATION> has been dubbed the ``Apartment Princess'' because of her
relatively humble abode _ faculty housing on the campus of <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>'s
<ORGANIZATION>Gakushuin University</ORGANIZATION>.
   At <LOCATION>Gakushuin</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Miss Kawashima</LOCATION> is working on her master's degree
in psychology. Her father, <PERSON>Tatsuhiko</PERSON>, teaches economics there.
   The former peer's school boasts much of the imperial family and
former nobility among its alumni. It is where <PERSON>Miss Kawashima</PERSON> and
her prince met in <DATE>1985</DATE>, when he too was a Gakushuin student.
   Since the engagement of Aya and <PERSON>Miss Kawashima</PERSON> was formally
announced in <DATE>September</DATE>, flocks of reporters often have staked out
the <PERSON>Kawashimas</PERSON>' three-bedroom apartment.
   They have tagged along as <PERSON>Miss Kawashima</PERSON> did her final
pre-wedding shopping, and even as she made a rare appearance at a
bowling alley. Her score was reportedly about 100.
   Though the Japanese and their media generally treat the monarchy
with great deference, photographing <PERSON>Miss Kawashima</PERSON>'s mother hanging
the family laundry out to dry is apparently acceptable, as is
broadcasting it to millions of television viewers.
   Aya, who returned <DATE>Thursday</DATE> from two years of zoology studies at
<LOCATION>England</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Oxford University</ORGANIZATION>, has managed to avoid most of the media
blitz.
   Palace officials say the somber, 15-minute wedding will begin
with the sound of shrill classical Japanese music. The young
couple, attended by several chamberlains, will slowly walk down a
corridor to a wooden shrine at the <ORGANIZATION>Imperial Palace</ORGANIZATION>.
   After Aya makes his vows to the sun goddess <ORGANIZATION>Amaterasu</ORGANIZATION>, from whom
legend says the imperial family descended, the couple will sip rice
wine to seal their marital bond.
   Later in the day, they are to visit <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Michiko</LOCATION> to
announce their marriage. In keeping with tradition, the emperor and
empress will not be among the guests invited to the ceremony itself.
   The guest list, however, does include such dignitaries as Prime
Minister <PERSON>Toshiki Kaifu</PERSON> and the heads of the judicial and
legislative branches of government.
   The emperor is to bestow upon Aya a new title to mark his
marriage and creation of an independent household. Aya's given name
is Fumihito, but Japanese only rarely refer to him by that.
   Following three days of receptions, and three more days to rest,
Aya and <PERSON>Miss Kawashima</PERSON> will travel to the Grand Shrines of Ise, the
central place of worship for believers of Shinto, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s
indigenous religion.
   Before returning to <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>, where they will pay their respects at
<PERSON>Hirohito</PERSON>'s mausoleum, they also will visit the tomb dedicated to
<LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s first emperor, <PERSON>Jimmu</PERSON>, who according to legend began his
reign in 660 <ORGANIZATION>B.C.
   Police</ORGANIZATION> plan to mobilize 9,000 officers to guard against leftist
attacks, and the public will have little chance to see the royal
couple in person.
   But a short ``parade,'' from the Imperial Palace to the <ORGANIZATION>Akasaka
Palace</ORGANIZATION> where the emperor and empress reside, is planned.

<HEAD>Koreans Mount Daily Protest at Japanese Embassy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   South Korean protesters held a sit-in
in front of the <ORGANIZATION>Japanese Embassy</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Friday</DATE> for the fifth
consecutive day to demand an apology by <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s emperor for
colonial rule of <LOCATION>Korea</LOCATION>.
   Some of their placards asked President <PERSON>Roh</PERSON> Tae-woo to cancel his
three-day visit to <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> next week. Roh has been under mounting
public pressure to put off the visit unless Emperor <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON> makes
such an apology.
   The protesters, relatives of Koreans drafted by <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> and killed
during World War II, were demanding an apology and compensation for
<LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s wartime acts.
   The protest began <DATE>Monday</DATE>, when about a dozen people, all more
than 50 years old, sat on the ground about 15 yards from the
embassy's main gate, shouting ``Akihito, apologize!'' About 60 riot
police guarded the embassy, but there have been no arrests.
   The protesters gather in the <TIME>morning</TIME> and stay several hours
after nightfall, reading statements and chanting slogans.
   Minor scuffles have broken out only when the protesters
screaming slogans try to run after cars carrying Japanese
diplomats. Some irate protesters hurled eggs on <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   The late Emperor <PERSON>Hirohito</PERSON>, who died in <DATE>January 1989</DATE>, said in
<DATE>1984</DATE> he sincerely regretted that there was an unfortunate past
between the two countries.
   However, South Korean officials have said the apology was
unclear to the Korean people.
   Prime Minister <PERSON>Toshiki Kaifu</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> has said he will apologize
to the Korean people next week. But Japanese officials have
resisted calls for Akihito to make a formal apology, saying the
emperor, the symbol of the Japanese state, should not be used for
political purposes.
   Anti-Japanese sentiment is strong among many elderly Koreans who
remember <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s harsh colonial rule. Following the Russo-Japanese
war, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> annexed <LOCATION>Korea</LOCATION> in <DATE>1910</DATE> and controlled it until the end of
World War II.
   During the war, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> drafted hundreds of thousands of <LOCATION>Koreans</LOCATION>
as soldiers and forced laborers.
   In <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> on <DATE>Friday</DATE>, authorities reported two suspected arson
attacks linked to <PERSON>Roh</PERSON>'s visit.
   Three cars were destroyed in one attack by suspected leftist
extremists at a state police headquarters in <LOCATION>Omiya</LOCATION>, just north of
<LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>, police said.
   Local authorities reported a separate fire at housing facilities
for South Korean residents in <LOCATION>Nagoya</LOCATION>, central <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, on <DATE>Thursday</DATE>
<TIME>evening</TIME>.
   No one was reported injured in either incident, and only minor
damage was reported to the building.
   Radical extremist groups that oppose <PERSON>Roh</PERSON>'s visit claim it is a
step toward reviving the Japanese empire as it existed earlier in
the century.

   <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s imperial family and top government
officials marked the first anniversary <DATE>Sunday</DATE> of Emperor <PERSON>Hirohito</PERSON>'s
death with ceremonies at the <ORGANIZATION>Imperial Palace</ORGANIZATION> and the late monarch's
tomb.
   The anniversary ended an official one-year mourning period for
the royal household, permitting in the coming months the marriage
of a prince and the elaborate coronation of <PERSON>Hirohito</PERSON>'s son, <PERSON>Emperor
Akihito</PERSON>.
   Early <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Empress Michiko</ORGANIZATION> presided over a quiet
ceremony at an <ORGANIZATION>Imperial Palace</ORGANIZATION> chamber where, by tradition, an
emperor's spirit is enshrined until his tomb is completed.
   About 115 guests, including Prime Minister <PERSON>Toshiki Kaifu</PERSON> and
leaders of <ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION>, attended the rite, during which <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON> read
a short prayer for his father's soul. The <PERSON>Empress Dowager Nagako</PERSON>,
86, did not attend because of hip and back problems.
   Another ceremony was to be held later in the afternoon at
<LOCATION>Hirohito</LOCATION>'s tomb. Construction of the dome-shaped mausoleum in
suburban <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> was completed <DATE>Saturday</DATE> at a reported cost of <MONEY>$18.5
million</MONEY>.
   Hirohito died of cancer <DATE>Jan. 7 last year</DATE> at the age of 87. His
62-year reign was the longest in Japanese history, and covered a
difficult period of militarist adventurism, defeat, foreign
occupation and rapid economic reconstruction.
   Under the postwar constitution, the emperor is a symbolic
figurehead who performs mostly ceremonial functions.
   Akihito assumed the throne immediately after his father's death,
but his official coronation will not be held until <DATE>November</DATE>. In a
draft budget for the fiscal year beginning <DATE>April 1</DATE>, the government
earmarked <MONEY>$58 million</MONEY> for the enthronement and related ceremonies.
   Prince <PERSON>Aya</PERSON>, who at 24 is <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON>'s youngest son, will wed
college sweetheart <PERSON>Kiko Kawashima</PERSON> on <DATE>June 29</DATE>. Aya is second in line
to the <LOCATION>Chrysanthemum Throne</LOCATION>.
