<TEXT>
   When <PERSON>Johnny Sylvester</PERSON>'s father wanted a second
opinion about his sick boy, he consulted Babe <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON>. The baseball
legend's treatment was unorthodox _ a <DATE>1926</DATE> World Series home run.
   <PERSON>John Dale Sylvester</PERSON>, 74, died <DATE>Monday</DATE>. But <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON>'s purported
promise and delivery of a home run lives on, memorialized in
newspapers, biographies and on film, though wildly distorted.
   ``So many things about Babe <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON> have become like Greek
mythology,'' baseball historian <PERSON>Don Honig</PERSON> said after hearing of
<ORGANIZATION>Sylvester</ORGANIZATION>'s death.
   Sylvester died at a hospital on <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Long Island</LOCATION>. No cause
of death was given.
   According to news reports from the time, <PERSON>Sylvester</PERSON> was kicked in
the head by a horse, suffering a life-threatening injury which left
the 11-year-old boy bedridden in <LOCATION>Essex Fells</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>
   Johnny reportedly told his father, <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION> bank vice president
<PERSON>Horace Sylvester</PERSON>, ``Gee, I wish I could see Babe <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON> wallop a
homer before I die.''
   The elder Sylvester contacted <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON>'s team, the <ORGANIZATION>New York Yankees</ORGANIZATION>,
in <LOCATION>St. Louis</LOCATION> via telegram, recounting his son's request.
Autographed balls from the <ORGANIZATION>Yankees</ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION>St. Louis Cardinals</LOCATION> were
sent to the lad; <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON> wrote on one ball, ``I'll hit a home run for
you in <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>'s game.''
   The Sultan of Swat then hit three homers in the <ORGANIZATION>Yankees</ORGANIZATION>' 10-5
fourth game victory over the <LOCATION>Cardinals</LOCATION>. Johnny's doctors reported
the boy had bounced back remarkably from his illness, and a legend
was born. Sylvester quickly became <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s most famous invalid.
   ``That and the called home run _ those two specific incidents
are probably the best known Ruth stories,'' said <PERSON>Robert Creamer</PERSON>,
author of the biography ``Babe.''
   ``The incident is sort of characteristic of Ruth. He had a great
sort of ingenious quality about him,'' said <PERSON>Creamer</PERSON>. ``He'd do
things like this, sometimes with great publicity, sometimes with no
publicity.''
   When <PERSON>William Bendix</PERSON> portrayed ``The Bambino'' on film, the story
had Ruth bedside with a dying boy when the home run was promised.
It was far from accurate, but as <PERSON>Creamer</PERSON> noted, ``That was a pretty
bad movie.''
   One week later, <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON> visited the lad. Johnny, well aware that
<PERSON>Ruth</PERSON> had been caught stealing for the final out in the Yankees
series loss, told the Babe, ``I'm sorry the Yanks lost.''
   Sylvester went on to attend <ORGANIZATION>Princeton University</ORGANIZATION>, serve in World
War II, and become president of packing machinery business. His
son, <PERSON>John Jr.</PERSON>, said his dad remained a <ORGANIZATION>Yankees</ORGANIZATION> fan until the end.
Slyvester is also survived by a sister and a brother.
   The whole <PERSON>Johnny Sylvester</PERSON> story apparently had little effect on
the Babe. According to <PERSON>Creamer</PERSON>'s biography, <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON> was sitting around
with a couple of baseball writers during <DATE>spring</DATE> training in <DATE>1927</DATE>
when <PERSON>Sylvester</PERSON>'s uncle approached the Babe and thanked him
profusely.
   ``How is Johnny?'' Ruth asked. The uncle assured the Babe that
<PERSON>Johnny</PERSON> was doing OK and walked away.
   Ruth, who was notoriously bad with names and referred to most
everyone as ``kid,'' turned to the reporters and asked, ``Now who
the hell is Johnny Sylvester?''

COURT RULES RUTH NAME IS PRIVATE, IMAGE IS NOT

<P>
Book publishers and baseball memorabilia collectors have scored a major victory 
in a court case about who can publish photographs of <LOCATION>Babe Ruth</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> federal appeals court ruled <DATE>Monday</DATE> that, although the Babe's heirs own 
his name, they do not own his image. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling stemmed from a lawsuit filed against <ORGANIZATION>Macmillan Inc.</ORGANIZATION> by <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON>'s 
daughters, <PERSON>Dorothy Ruth Pirone</PERSON> and <PERSON>Julia Ruth Stevens</PERSON>, claiming that <PERSON>Macmillan</PERSON> 
had illegally used three photographs of <ORGANIZATION>Ruth</ORGANIZATION> in a <DATE>1988</DATE> baseball trivia 
calendar. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Judge Irving R. Kaufman</PERSON> wrote in his opinion: "Ruth was one of the most 
photographed men of his generation, a larger-than-life hero to millions and a 
historical figure in whom interest still runs high." 
</P>
<P>
While Ruth lived, the judge wrote, he was paid by various manufacturers for the 
use of his picture or name in promoting the sale of various products. After 
<PERSON>Ruth</PERSON>'s death in <DATE>1948</DATE>, his daughters registered the words <PERSON>Babe Ruth</PERSON> as a 
trademark for "paper articles, namely playing cards, writing paper and 
envelopes," <PERSON>Kaufman</PERSON> wrote. 
</P>
<P>
That trademark has been lucrative. <PERSON>Mark Roesler</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Curtis Management 
Group</ORGANIZATION>, the Babe's Indianapolis-based licensing agent, said last <DATE>December</DATE> that 
fees paid to the <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON> family were estimated at <MONEY>$400,000</MONEY> for <DATE>1989</DATE> and were 
expected to grow to <MONEY>$1 million</MONEY> in <DATE>1990</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
The photographs at issue in the case appeared in the <DATE>1988</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>Macmillan Baseball 
Engagement Calendar</ORGANIZATION>. The words Babe <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON> are not on the calendar cover, the 
judge noted. 
</P>
<P>
The calendar cover has a photo of <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON> helping a small boy with his batting 
grip. Inside the calendar, there is a photo of the Babe saluting Gen. <PERSON>John 
Pershing</PERSON> and a photo of a baseball autographed by <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
Ruth's daughters objected to the use of <ORGANIZATION>Ruth</ORGANIZATION>'s likeness. Their suit alleged 
federal and common-law trademark infringement and unfair competition, 
infringement of the common law right of publicity and violation of the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> 
Civil Rights Law. The <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> law forbids the use for advertising or trade 
purposes of any portrait or picture without the consent of the subject if the 
subject is living. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Judge Kaufman</PERSON> acknowledged that there is a valuable commodity in a public 
figure's image, but he said that <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON>'s daughters had made much too broad a 
claim.

<TEXT>
   Babe <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON> wasn't just a legendary home run
hitter for the <ORGANIZATION>New York Yankees</ORGANIZATION> _ he's a registered federal
trademark, his two daughters have charged in a suit against
<ORGANIZATION>MacMillan Publishing</ORGANIZATION>.
   The suit filed <DATE>Friday</DATE> in <ORGANIZATION>U.S. District Court</ORGANIZATION> by <PERSON>Dorothy Ruth
Pirone</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Durham</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Conn.</LOCATION>, and <PERSON>Julia Ruth Stevens</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Conway</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.H.</LOCATION>,
seeks to halt sales of a <DATE>1988</DATE> calendar published by <PERSON>MacMillan</PERSON> that
carries a picture of the late slugger on its cover.
   ``<PERSON>MacMillan</PERSON>'s unauthorized, unlicensed and unapproved use of
Babe <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON>'s image, likeness and name tends to cause confusion and
deceive the public,'' said attorney <PERSON>Martin A. Levitin</PERSON>, representing
the <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON> family, in court papers.
   ``The <DATE>1988</DATE> MacMillan Baseball Engagement Calendar'' includes two
photos of the Babe that were used without permission of the family,
the suit charged.
   The suit, which also lists <ORGANIZATION>Babe Ruth League Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Curtis
Management Group Inc.</ORGANIZATION> as plaintiffs, said <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON>'s daughters filed a
written request with <ORGANIZATION>MacMillan</ORGANIZATION> asking it to halt distribution of
the calendar. The publisher allegedly ignored the request.
   Ruth's daughters received a federal trademark last year for the
name ``Babe Ruth'' on paper articles, the suit said. Curtis handles
licensing of third parties seeking to use Ruth's name, it said.
   <PERSON>Sharon Dynak</PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION>MacMillan</ORGANIZATION>, said she had not yet
seen the suit and had no immediate comment on the suit, which
charges <ORGANIZATION>MacMillan</ORGANIZATION> with trademark infringement and unfair
competition.
   The plaintiffs asked <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> District <PERSON>Judge Pierre Leval</PERSON> for a
permanent injunction blocking <ORGANIZATION>MacMillan</ORGANIZATION> from using additional
photos of Ruth; an award to the plaintiffs of all profits made from
calendar sales; additional monetary damages; and reimbursement for
all lawyers' fees.

<TEXT>
   Babe <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON>'s daughters struck out in federal
court when an appeals court ruled that a publisher did not infringe
on their trademark by using pictures of the <LOCATION>Bambino</LOCATION> in a calendar.
   Three judges of the <ORGANIZATION>2nd U.S. Court of Appeals</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Monday</DATE> upheld a
lower court ruling that dismissed a lawsuit by <PERSON>Julia Ruth Stevens</PERSON>
and <PERSON>Dorothy Ruth Pirone</PERSON>, who has since died, and against <ORGANIZATION>Macmillan
Inc</ORGANIZATION>.
   After <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON>'s death, the sisters registered the words ``Babe
Ruth'' as a trademark for playing cards and other uses.
   The court said the trademark did not apply to photographs of
<PERSON>Ruth</PERSON>.
   The calendar, ``The <DATE>1988</DATE> Macmillan Baseball Engagement
Calendar,'' contained three references to <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON>. The cover was a
photograph of <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON> helping a boy with his batting grip; a week in
<DATE>October</DATE> was illustrated with a picture of <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON> saluting General
<PERSON>John Pershing</PERSON>; and a page in the <DATE>December</DATE> section had a photograph
of a baseball autographed by <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON>.

<TEXT>
   <PERSON>John Dale ``Johnny'' Sylvester</PERSON>, who became
the most famous little sick boy in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> after <LOCATION>Babe Ruth</LOCATION> promised
to smack a World Series homer for him _ and hit three _ has died 63
years later. He was 74.
   Sylvester died <DATE>Monday</DATE> at a <LOCATION>Mineola</LOCATION> hospital. No cause of death
was given.
   In <DATE>1926</DATE>, <PERSON>Sylvester</PERSON> was suffering from a serious infection of the
forehead caused by a kick from a horse when he told his father, ``I
wish I could see Babe <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON> wallop a homer before I die.''
   The family sent telegrams to the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> Yankees while they
were playing in <LOCATION>St. Louis</LOCATION>. Back came an airmail package containing
two baseballs, one autographed by the <ORGANIZATION>St. Louis Cardinals</ORGANIZATION>, the
other signed by several <ORGANIZATION>Yankees</ORGANIZATION>, including <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON>, who wrote, ``I'll
knock a homer for you on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.''
   Ruth hit three that day. In a follow-up note the day of Game 6,
<PERSON>Ruth</PERSON> said he would ``try to knock you another homer, maybe two
<DATE>today</DATE>,'' but went homerless. He hit one in Game 7 but it was not
enough to prevent the Yankees from losing the Series. In fact, <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON>
was caught stealing for the final out.
   Ruth visited the <LOCATION>Essex Fells</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>, boy at his bedside after the
Series, a meeting at which Sylvester remarked, ``I'm sorry the
Yanks lost.''
   No miraculous recovery occurred, but the visit certainly did no
harm. It took Sylvester three years before he fully recovered.
Sylvester returned the gesture in <DATE>1948</DATE>, visiting Ruth four months
before the slugger died of cancer.
   The <DATE>1926</DATE> episode later was part of the movie ``The Babe <PERSON>Ruth
Story</PERSON>,'' but the screen version stretched the truth by having <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON>
make his home run promise at <ORGANIZATION>Sylvester</ORGANIZATION>'s hospital bedside. The boy
apparently was never hospitalized.
   Earlier, in the <DATE>1942</DATE> movie ``The Pride of the Yankees,''
Hollywood had stretched the tale even further with a promise of two
home runs by <PERSON>Lou Gehrig</PERSON>.
   Sylvester served in the <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> in World War II and was later
president of <ORGANIZATION>Amscomatic Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a manufacturer of packing machinery.
   He is survived by his son, <PERSON>John Jr.</PERSON>, a sister, <PERSON>Ruth Elliott</PERSON> of
<LOCATION>Barrington R.I.</LOCATION>, and a brother, <PERSON>Horace C. Sylvester Jr.</PERSON>, of
<LOCATION>Osterville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass</LOCATION>.

LARRY KING GOES TO BAT FOR BABE RUTH MUSEUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN STEADMAN, BALTIMORE EVENING SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
All shapes and sizes of organizations have tried to recruit <PERSON>Larry King</PERSON>, one of 
the most distinctive voices in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>, with the hope he might agree to stand 
up and offer an appeal for this or that cause. But it's not his game. He didn't 
want to be linked with fund-raising, or putting one charity ahead of another. 
So he declined, ever so politely. 
</P>
<P>
He has an imposing stature in the field of broadcasting and, in fact, has 
earned a presence for himself that rivals such luminaries of the past as <PERSON>Arthur 
Godfrey</PERSON>, <PERSON>Walter Winchell</PERSON> and <PERSON>Ed Sullivan</PERSON>. There's an ethical awareness that 
prevents him from using his network platform to solicit contributions. 
</P>
<P>
But then along came the <ORGANIZATION>Babe Ruth Museum</ORGANIZATION>, located in <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION>, and it asked 
King if he would become national chairman of its membership committee. His 
answer was a ringing acceptance and endorsement of a new campaign that will 
extend the facility's physical dimensions via an extensive expansion effort. 
</P>
<P>
King will be the point man, the personality who is out front selling the idea 
to individuals and corporations all across the nation. "The name Babe <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON> 
catches everyone's attention," he said. "The Babe was symbolic of baseball. He 
was and is baseball." 
</P>
<P>
A historian of a sport he enjoys and understands, <PERSON>King</PERSON> knows Ruth towers above 
all players, past and present, in talent and a sense of the dramatic. King 
never saw <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON> play and wasn't old enough the one year, <DATE>1939</DATE>, when he served as 
a first-base coach for the <ORGANIZATION>Brooklyn Dodgers</ORGANIZATION> and took batting practice, which 
was a cheap grandstand ploy to sell tickets. 
</P>
<P>
"No, but I was in <LOCATION>Ebbets Field</LOCATION> and heard his farewell speech (<DATE>April 27, 1947</DATE>) 
when baseball celebrated Babe <PERSON>Ruth Day</PERSON> all over <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>. The comments <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON> made 
in <LOCATION>Yankee Stadium</LOCATION> about what baseball represented to the boys of our country 
and the other things he had to say, with a voice weakened by cancer, were 
pumped into <LOCATION>Ebbets Field</LOCATION> and to all other ballparks." 
</P>
<P>
What <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON> had to say and how he struggled against the pain to speak in not much 
more than whisper so impressed King that he hasn't forgotten the tugging 
emotion of the moment. "No doubt, he was <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s greatest athlete, born and 
raised in <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION> and, in fact, as a child lived on the exact location where 
center field is going to be located in the new ballpark." 
</P>
<P>
On the subject of a stadium name, <PERSON>King</PERSON> reiterated his position. "It should be 
Babe <PERSON>Ruth Park</PERSON>," he emphasized. "To ignore Ruth's ties to <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION> amid so 
much rich background would be some sort of craziness to me. Imagine the 
marketing value of the name. Without <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION>, plus the Orioles signing him, 
the world never would have heard of him." 
</P>
<P>
And if you want a little-known note about <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON>, listen as <ORGANIZATION>King</ORGANIZATION> provides it. 
"With all of <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON>'s hitting attainments, don't forget he won 94 games as a 
pitcher. And do you realize that in winning percentage against the <ORGANIZATION>New York 
Yankees</ORGANIZATION>, he stands second in percentage. When he was with the <ORGANIZATION>Boston Red Sox</ORGANIZATION>, 
he beat the Yanks 17 times and lost only five." 
</P>
<P>
King has long been a <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION> booster. He was raised in <LOCATION>Brooklyn</LOCATION>, worked in 
<LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> and is now based in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>. But if he has adopted a city by 
acclamation it would have to be <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION>. That's because two of his broadcast 
friends, the late <PERSON>Bill O'Donnell</PERSON> and <PERSON>Joe Croghan</PERSON>, continually talked of its 
place in history and what it represented. 
</P>
<P>
So King was impressed. The Orioles draw his personal attention as no other team 
in sports. King is a student of the game, knows its <PERSON>Hall</PERSON> of Fame heroes as well 
as the utility journeymen and talks with in-depth knowledge of the character 
and nuances of baseball. 
</P>
<P>
He mentioned the unprecedented achievement of the Orioles winning seven 
straight pennants in the <ORGANIZATION>International League</ORGANIZATION>, a dynasty that stands alone in 
the record book. And then he pointed out that <PERSON>Al Kaline</PERSON>, a Baltimore-born <ORGANIZATION>Hall 
of Famer</ORGANIZATION>, lived only five minutes away from where <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON> was born, the site of 
the museum at 216 <ORGANIZATION>Emory St.</ORGANIZATION> 
</P>
<P>
More than 28,000 men, women and children visited the "House of Ruth" last year 
and the total should continue to climb. It's the largest baseball museum in the 
country -- next to the <PERSON>Hall</PERSON> of Fame in <LOCATION>Cooperstown</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION> -- and features 
exhibits that pay tribute to <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON>, to the Orioles and to other distinguished 
<LOCATION>Maryland</LOCATION> players. 
</P>
<P>
King wants to send out a message to stimulate more interest in the <LOCATION>United 
States</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> among fans, with the enthusiastic expectation they will want 
to go to bat for <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON>, in a manner of speaking and, in turn, enable the museum 
to enlarge. The Babe would've liked that.

   <PERSON>Sen. Lowell P. Weicker</PERSON> wants <ORGANIZATION>Hall of Famer
Babe Ruth</ORGANIZATION> to be honored with the <ORGANIZATION>Presidential Medal of Freedom</ORGANIZATION>,
nearly 40 years after the baseball slugger's death.
   Ruth was a ``true American hero'' who ``epitomized the very best
of our national pastime,'' <PERSON>Weicker</PERSON>, <LOCATION>R-Conn.</LOCATION>, said <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   The medal, the nation's highest civilian award, is given by the
president for contributions to national security, world peace or
``significant private or public endeavors.'' Seventy-one Medals of
Freedom have been awarded by President <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>.
   Weicker, in a letter to <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> nominating <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON> for the award,
noted the athlete's off-the-field contributions.
   ``He had great compassion for the sick and dying,'' the senator
said. ``Against the advice of many, <LOCATION>Babe Ruth</LOCATION> visited those
afflicted with <PERSON>Hansen</PERSON>'s Disease in <LOCATION>Kalappapa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>, and offered
those condemned to the `leper' colony his love and kindness.''
   Well known for his visits to sick children, <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON> also
established the <ORGANIZATION>Babe Ruth Foundation</ORGANIZATION> for underprivileged children
shortly before his death and left it a large part of his estate.
   Born in <DATE>1895</DATE> in <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION>, <PERSON>George Herman Ruth</PERSON> hit 714 home runs
in 22 major league seasons with the <ORGANIZATION>Boston Red Sox</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>New York
Yankees</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Boston Braves</LOCATION>.
   A star pitcher early in his career, <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON>'s career home run total
stood as the major league record until <PERSON>Hank Aaron</PERSON> broke it in <DATE>1974</DATE>.
   Ruth died <DATE>Aug. 16, 1948</DATE>, at the age of 53.
   Other baseball players who have received the award include
former <ORGANIZATION>Yankee</ORGANIZATION> great <PERSON>Joe DiMaggio</PERSON> and the late <PERSON>Jackie Robinson</PERSON>, who
became the first black in the major leagues in the modern era when
he played for the <ORGANIZATION>Brooklyn Dodgers</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1947</DATE>.

<TEXT>     The happy result is a big-league performance from the Broadway-trained <PERSON>Lang</PERSON>
in <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION>'s "Babe <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON>," a stirring bio-film that premieres tonight at 9 as a
major event of baseball's World Series month.;   <PERSON>Lang</PERSON>'s <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON> is an incredibly
vain, headstrong hell-raiser who set as many records in the bedroom and at the
table as he did at the ballpark. Far from the bear-like buffoon <PERSON>William Bendix</PERSON>
played in the sanitized <DATE>1948</DATE> film "The Babe <PERSON>Ruth Story</PERSON>," <PERSON>Lang</PERSON>'s <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON> is a
hot-tempered giant who could look the commissioner of baseball in the eye and
call him a "white-haired old bastard," regardless of the fine and suspension
that guaranteed. He's a man who wanted it all, no matter who got hurt in the
process.;   Yet the new "Babe Ruth" isn't just a myth-busting movie that
rewrites the legend. Lang's <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON> also takes us behind the bluster to see the
vulnerable man whose parents dumped him in a Catholic industrial school for
boys at an early age, then forgot about him.;   "I was too big and ugly for
anybody to come and see," the adult <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON> tells a lonely boy when he returns to
the school many years later.;   More than anything, though, the new "Babe
Ruth" presents a formidable challenge to an actor. Lang not only had to beef
up for the role (gaining 35 pounds) and master Ruth's unorthodox batting
stance and unique base-trotting style, but also had to make a frequently
unpleasant man likable enough to command our attention for two hours.;   <PERSON>Lang</PERSON>
has the tools to meet such a challenge. Schooled at the famed Actors' Studio
and various regional theater companies, he appeared on Broadway with <PERSON>Dustin
Hoffman</PERSON> in "Death of A Salesman" and earned a Tony nomination last season for
"The Speed of Darkness." His films include "Last Exit to <LOCATION>Brooklyn</LOCATION>" and
"Manhunter." In TV, he's best known for roles in "Crime Story" and the TV
version of <PERSON>Hoffman</PERSON>'s "Salesman." Lang is known as an actor who gets deeply
involved with the characters he plays. He approached the role by locating what
he felt was the central metaphor for <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON>'s life, which he found in a quote
from Ruth.;   "He said, 'I swing big; I hit big or I miss big; and that's the
way I live my life -- as big as I can,' " <PERSON>Lang</PERSON> explained.;   <PERSON>Lang</PERSON> decided he'd
take a "big bite" of the role and play it the way the real Ruth played ball.
But first the right-handed <PERSON>Lang</PERSON> had to get Ruth's left-handed swing down pat.;
  The producers arranged for him to work with another baseball star -- <PERSON>Hall of
Famer Rod Carew</PERSON>, who retired in <DATE>1986</DATE> with a lifetime batting average of .328
and seven <ORGANIZATION>American League</ORGANIZATION> batting titles. After daily batting practice at
<ORGANIZATION>Carew</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION> baseball school, <PERSON>Lang</PERSON> compared videotapes of
himself with films of Ruth until he could match them perfectly.;   "When the
hitting began to fall into place," said <PERSON>Lang</PERSON>, "then playing the role began to
fall into place.";   (<ORGANIZATION>Carew</ORGANIZATION> claims <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON> had "terrible mechanics" as a hitter
and must have been incredibly strong to hit the ball as hard as he did from
his stance.);   The movie skips over <LOCATION>Ruth</LOCATION>'s days as a pitcher for the <ORGANIZATION>Boston
Red Sox</ORGANIZATION> and begins in <DATE>1920</DATE>, when the Babe was acquired by the <ORGANIZATION>New York
Yankees</ORGANIZATION>, primarily as a power hitter. In those days, the 6-foot-2 Ruth weighed
about 215 and was in trim shape. In the twilight of his career in the early
<DATE>1930s</DATE>, <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON> was much heavier, with a waistline of about 43 inches. Lang didn't
have time to gain that much weight, so makeup specialist <PERSON>Michael Westmore</PERSON>
fitted him with body padding and some special appliances to make his face and
neck appear fuller.;   For <PERSON>Lang</PERSON>, a lifelong baseball fan who grew up in <LOCATION>New
York</LOCATION>, the chance to play <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON> was the proverbial dream come true. Lang lives
just three miles from the site in <LOCATION>Valhalla</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>, where <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON> is buried and has
regarded him as a hero since his earliest childhood.;   "The deeper I got into
him, the closer I felt to him," said <PERSON>Lang</PERSON>. "He was an extremely complex figure
-- and a very vulnerable figure with tremendous needs.";   In <PERSON>Lang</PERSON>'s mind,
Ruth altered baseball forever by changing it from "little ball," with the
emphasis on singles, doubles and sacrifices, to "big ball," where the crowd
came to see home run sluggers.;   In his last year with the <ORGANIZATION>Red Sox</ORGANIZATION> before
joining the <ORGANIZATION>Yankees</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON> hit 29 homers, a then overwhelming feat that <PERSON>Lang</PERSON>
believes made baseball fans "long-ball hungry" for good. In <DATE>1927</DATE>, <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON> hit 60
home runs, more than any other team in the <ORGANIZATION>American League</ORGANIZATION>. He ended his
career with 714 homers (not counting his 15 in World Series competition), a
record surpassed only by <PERSON>Hank Aaron</PERSON>, who broke <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON>'s record 39 years later,
taking many more times at bat to do it.;   "People would rather see Ruth
strike out than see a lot of other fine players hit a single or double," said
Lang.;   <PERSON>Lang</PERSON>'s next acting assignment also is an extremely challenging one:
He'll play <LOCATION>Hamlet</LOCATION> on Broadway in <DATE>February</DATE>. But he's aware his portrayal of
<PERSON>Ruth</PERSON> may be a career-making one that people won't soon forget.;   "Maybe I'll
get a role as good as Babe," he said, "but I don't think I'll ever get one
better." (box)  </TEXT>

BABE RUTH: DEAD 41 YEARS, HE LIVES ON IN ENDORSEMENTS THAT BRING HEIRS HUNDREDS 
OF THOUSANDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Imagine the potential Babe <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON> would have in today's 
every-athlete-has-a-sneaker-deal endorsement market. 
</P>
<P>
He could rival <PERSON>Bo Jackson</PERSON> -- "Babe knows baseball. . . . Babe knows hot dogs" 
-- hawk <ORGANIZATION>Hertz</ORGANIZATION> with <PERSON>Arnie</PERSON> and <PERSON>O. J.</PERSON>, look lumpy in his Hanes with <PERSON>Boomer 
Esiason</PERSON>, pitch Slimfast diets with <PERSON>Lasorda</PERSON> and take sides in the <PERSON>Miller Lite</PERSON> 
"Less filling! Tastes Great!" debate. 
</P>
<P>
As it is, <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON> is not doing shabbily. Forty-one years after his death, <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON>'s 
name and visage are licensed to more than 100 companies and products -- banks, 
car companies, retailers, trading card firms, teddy bears, and a maker of 
trapping knives -- avidly trying to profit from his powerful, mythic and 
mischievous appeal. 
</P>
<P>
The Bambino is earning wealth for his heirs that, given his own commercial 
bent, surely wouldn't have surprised the man who did not break stride when told 
his <MONEY>$80,000</MONEY> salary exceeded President <PERSON>Hoover</PERSON>'s. 
</P>
<P>
In an era in which celebrity worship is at its height, stars such as the Babe 
cannot commit the ultimate no-no of endorsement deals: getting in trouble. 
Though the Babe was known to imbibe, smoke and carouse, his conduct is now 
impeccable. Through the selective filter of hero worship, the Babe's image is 
as clean as <PERSON>Orel Hershiser</PERSON>'s. 
</P>
<P>
Add to that trend the expanding market for baseball memorabilia, and it's easy 
to see why the most popular player in the sport's history remains its most 
durable commercial symbol. 
</P>
<P>
So, whether he endorses <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION> personal computers, sneakers, free checking for 
senior citizens at a <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> bank, <ORGANIZATION>Zenith</ORGANIZATION> power supplies or the 
<ORGANIZATION>Hewlett-Packard</ORGANIZATION> sales force, <PERSON>Babe Ruth</PERSON> stands for whatever the paying company 
desires. 
</P>
<P>
"The legend of <ORGANIZATION>Babe Ruth</ORGANIZATION> is a very tangible thing," said <PERSON>Mark Roesler</PERSON>, 
president of <ORGANIZATION>Curtis Management Group</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Babe</ORGANIZATION>'s Indianapolis-based licensing 
agent. "Babe's image as the ultimate power hitter, the ultimate superstar isn't 
going to change. (<PERSON>Roger</PERSON>) <PERSON>Maris</PERSON> hit 61 homers, but the Babe's image will never 
change. He's achieved his place in history. Current players have not." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Roesler</PERSON> said that fees paid to the <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON> family, including his surviving 
daughter, <PERSON>Julia Ruth Stevens</PERSON>, and his two daughters' children, and <ORGANIZATION>Babe Ruth 
Baseball Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, were estimated at <MONEY>$400,000</MONEY> for <DATE>1989</DATE> and are expected to grow to 
at least <MONEY>$1 million</MONEY> in <DATE>1990</DATE>. <PERSON>Roesler</PERSON> said that before <PERSON>Curtis</PERSON> took control of 
the Ruth marketing from <ORGANIZATION>Babe Ruth Baseball</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1984</DATE>, annual fees amounted to 
less than <MONEY>$100</MONEY>. 
</P>
<P>
How would the Babe do if he returned in the pot-bellied flesh? 
</P>
<P>
Not badly, but he'd have more competition in a more active market. And he would 
risk being a disaster to those who would hire him as their spokesman if his 
personal excesses were as probed and criticized as those of today's stars. 
</P>
<P>
But if he controlled himself, he might outdo everybody. 
</P>
<P>
Said <PERSON>Daisy Sinclair</PERSON>, casting director for the <ORGANIZATION>Ogilvy &amp; Mather</ORGANIZATION> advertising 
agency: "I can't think of a category around that he wouldn't fit into, except 
Weight Watchers. He could do ads for vitamins because looking at him, you 
wonder how he could do what he did." 
</P>
<P>
When <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON> was the highest-paid player in baseball, the endorsement game was 
small. He got around more than any other star, endorsing a hat, a brand of 
cigar -- he puffed on them in the showroom window of the factory -- chewing 
tobacco, long johns, shoes, a watch and autographed balls given away by <ORGANIZATION>Texaco</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
He also backed the short-lived Babe <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON>'s Home Run Candy, which lost a legal 
fight with the makers of the <ORGANIZATION>Baby Ruth</ORGANIZATION> candy bar -- named not for the Babe, but 
for <PERSON>Grover Cleveland</PERSON>'s daughter, <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON> -- and a <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION> haberdashery, <PERSON>Babe 
Ruth</PERSON>'s for Men, that shut its doors in six months. 
</P>
<P>
"Commercialization was so much less then," said <PERSON>Robert Creamer</PERSON>, author of 
"Babe: The Legend Comes to Life," the definitive <DATE>1974</DATE> biography of Ruth. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, it strikes me as something weird that a man dead 40 years can be a live 
property. But it's obvious that he's a recognizable personality and a 
plus-person -- that is, someone you'd like to see here now." 
</P>
<P>
Plenty of marketers evidently think the Babe is worth the price of seeing him, 
if not in person, in two dimensions. You want the Babe for a one-time ad in a 
newspaper? That will be <MONEY>$500</MONEY>. You want to put the Babe in a national print 
campaign? Pay <MONEY>$15,000</MONEY>, please. Now you want the <ORGANIZATION>Babe</ORGANIZATION> in a national multi-media 
campaign? Well, that will be <MONEY>$100,000</MONEY>. 
</P>
<P>
What do marketers want from <LOCATION>Babe Ruth</LOCATION>? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Power: For a <ORGANIZATION>Sears Business Centers</ORGANIZATION> campaign, the retailer paid about 
<MONEY>$10,000</MONEY> to feature Ruth in its "heavy hitters" advertising series to sell 
several makes of personal computers. The ads -- with retouched photos of the 
Babe holding or using PCs -- noted that the products were "marked down to 
prices in your ballpark. All heavy hitters . . . Not bad, huh, Babe?" 
</P>
<P>
 -- History: For the marketers at <ORGANIZATION>United Valley Bank</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON>'s 
image, teamed with that of teammate <PERSON>Lou Gehrig</PERSON>, provided a touchstone for its 
target group: depositors 55 and older. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're old enough to remember them, you can forget about paying for 
checking," said the slogan, above a posed shot of <PERSON>Ruth and Gehrig</PERSON> before the 
<ORGANIZATION>Yankee Stadium</ORGANIZATION> backstop. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Inspiration: The <ORGANIZATION>Carlson Marketing Group</ORGANIZATION>'s motivation division used <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON>'s 
image and his words -- "Baseball is a great teacher" -- on a poster to gussy up 
a baseball-oriented incentive program designed for computer sales forces. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Dependability: <ORGANIZATION>Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp.</ORGANIZATION> featured a photo of <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON>'s 
"called shot" in the <DATE>1932</DATE> World Series against <ORGANIZATION>Chicago Cub</ORGANIZATION> pitcher Charlie Root 
to illustrate reliability. 
</P>
<P>
"A promise made, a promise kept," read the ad. 
</P>
<P>
Chattanooga cutlery maker <PERSON>Jim Frost</PERSON> produces a series of commemorative trapping 
knives named for <ORGANIZATION>Ruth</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Gehrig</PERSON> and <PERSON>Ty Cobb</PERSON>. They are encased in walnut music 
boxes that play "Take Me Out to the Ball Game." 
</P>
<P>
Said Frost: "This is the era of name recognition, and we've gone this route to 
promote our merchandise. On the Ruth knife, we have an etching of him on the 
blade and an authorization slip that tells some of his history. We limit 
production to 3,000 pieces." 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Curtis Management Group</ORGANIZATION> has carved a specialty out of marketing celebrities. 
Besides <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON>, <PERSON>Gehrig</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Cobb</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Curtis</PERSON>' sports clientele -- featuring 27 <PERSON>Hall</PERSON> of 
Famers -- includes <PERSON>Honus Wagner</PERSON>, <PERSON>Roberto Clemente</PERSON>, <PERSON>Casey Stengel</PERSON>, <PERSON>Bob Feller</PERSON>, 
<PERSON>Vince Lombardi</PERSON>, <PERSON>Jim Thorpe</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jesse Owens</PERSON>. Its entertainment- and 
historical-figure roster features <PERSON>James Dean</PERSON>, <PERSON>Fred Astaire</PERSON>, <PERSON>Humphrey Bogart</PERSON>, 
<PERSON>Mark Twain</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Amelia Earhart</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Hardly a baseball legend wanted by marketers is out of <PERSON>Curtis</PERSON>' realm. 
</P>
<P>
Said <PERSON>Jeff Stevens</PERSON>, merchandising director of the <ORGANIZATION>Baseball Hall</ORGANIZATION> of Fame: "If 
something we're doing is beyond the scope of the agreement the <ORGANIZATION>Hall of Famers</ORGANIZATION> 
have directly with the <PERSON>Hall</PERSON> for products we sell in our gift shop or through 
our catalogue, we go to <PERSON>Curtis</PERSON>. In fact, we're doing a series of <DATE>1991</DATE> calendars 
that use only Curtis clients." 
</P>
<P>
Curtis has been especially active in the last year, increasing its stable of 
baseball clients to about 30 former players. 
</P>
<P>
The year just past was the biggest yet for <PERSON>Lou Gehrig</PERSON> licensing, because of the 
50th anniversary of his emotional retirement from baseball and <ORGANIZATION>Major League 
Baseball</ORGANIZATION>'s dedication of the season to the <ORGANIZATION>ALS Foundation</ORGANIZATION>, which raises funds 
to research a cure for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or <PERSON>Lou Gehrig</PERSON>'s Disease. 
</P>
<P>
Eighty-seven companies are "Iron Horse" licensees, many for products tied to 
the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Postal Service</ORGANIZATION>'s issue of a Gehrig stamp last <DATE>June</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Some estates restrict what the legends can sell. 
</P>
<P>
In <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON>'s case, his daughters have barred liquor and tobacco ads. 
</P>
<P>
In <PERSON>Gehrig</PERSON>'s case, said <PERSON>Roesler</PERSON>: "We respect <PERSON>Eleanor Gehrig</PERSON>'s wish not to use 
<PERSON>Lou Gehrig</PERSON> for fund-raising purposes. He's not licensed for any ALS research 
group except the one at <ORGANIZATION>Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center</ORGANIZATION> (the <PERSON>Eleanor</PERSON> and 
<PERSON>Lou Gehrig</PERSON> ALS Center), though we allowed the ALS Foundation to do a few 
specific things this year." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Eleanor Gehrig</PERSON> left her estate and the rights to market her husband to the 
medical center, which derived a six-figure licensing income this year. 
</P>
<P>
Properties such as <PERSON>Ruth and Gehrig</PERSON>, valuable in life and death, are protected. 
Curtis has 18 infringement suits pending, including a protracted action against 
<ORGANIZATION>Macmillan Publishing Co.</ORGANIZATION> over an engagement calendar that <PERSON>Curtis</PERSON> alleges 
illegally used a photograph of Ruth; and two against card collector firms for 
alleged unauthorized use of the images of 10 of its players on card sets. 
</P>
<P>
Celebrity representatives are gaining more protection because of new state laws 
that grant the dead stars' exclusive licensing rights to their heirs for a 
specified number of years. For example, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>'s <DATE>1985</DATE> law grants the heirs 
licensing rights for 50 years after a celebrity's death; <LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION>'s term is 100 
years, <LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION>'s 50 and <LOCATION>Tennessee</LOCATION>'s 10. 
</P>
<P>
Even when the 50-year bell tolls on <LOCATION>Babe Ruth</LOCATION> in <DATE>1998</DATE>, there are other legal 
ways to protect his name and likeness. Curtis has secured trademark protection 
in categories such as paper goods, gifts, apparel and footwear that will 
protect the family's rights as long as their legacy's name and image stay in 
continual use. 
</P>
<P>
So as long as the Ruth legend remains a never-dying part of the magic and lore 
of baseball, it seems clear that marketers will turn to him when they want to 
ally their product or message with his ever-living mystique. 
</P>
<P>
"You look at today's players: most have professional credibility, but not the 
extra spark of charisma," said <PERSON>Marty Blackman</PERSON>, who advises corporations on the 
use of personalities in commercials. "But when you look for a spokesman, you 
want professional credibility, which <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON> had with his hitting and home runs; 
and charisma, which he really had. He's one of those people who rose to the top 
and just stayed there."

<LEADPARA>  CREATING almost as much stir as Stephen Lang's portrayal of "Babe Ruth" in
tonight's NBC movie is the man who plays baseball legend Ty Cobb in the film:
Pete Rose.;   A baseball immortal himself, Rose took on his first acting role
in the midst of the ongoing controversy over his disgrace in a betting scandal
that ended with his being banned from baseball for life in 1990.  </LEADPARA>

<MEMO>  See also related article on page 6 of this section.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     In the film, <ORGANIZATION>Rose</ORGANIZATION> has just one scene as <ORGANIZATION>Cobb</ORGANIZATION> with <ORGANIZATION>Lang</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>Babe Ruth</LOCATION>. Ruth is
eager to become a baseball manager; so he meets with <PERSON>Cobb</PERSON>, then player-manager
of the <ORGANIZATION>Detroit Tigers</ORGANIZATION>, to see how he likes it.;   Ironically, <PERSON>Rose</PERSON>, years
later, also was a player-manager for his team, the <LOCATION>Cincinnati</LOCATION> Reds. He also
was known as a "hustling" ballplayer like <PERSON>Cobb</PERSON> and, in fact, was the man who
broke <ORGANIZATION>Cobb</ORGANIZATION>'s record for total hits.;   "It just seemed to be a perfect
choice," said producer <PERSON>Frank Pace</PERSON>. "Rose named his son after <PERSON>Ty Cobb</PERSON> and knows
more about <ORGANIZATION>Cobb</ORGANIZATION> than possibly any person living.";   But there were limits to
how Rose could be used in the film. Organized baseball refused to permit Rose
to appear in a major league uniform and wouldn't allow him to be photographed
at a ballpark. One ballpark scene where Cobb disputes an umpire's call on <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON>
was canceled. Rose appears in street clothes in a hotel room for his only
scene as Cobb.;   How does Rose perform as an actor? This critic thinks he's
fine in a very small part, but Executive Producer <PERSON>Lawrence Lyttle</PERSON>, the man who
signed <PERSON>Rose</PERSON>'s paycheck, offers a professional opinion:;   "He has a natural
cadence about his acting, and he was absolutely charming. I think everybody's
going to be surprised at just how natural he is as a performer." (box)  </TEXT>

ANAHEIM CLASSIC STIRS MEMORIES OF 1967 GAME AND BABE RUTH-WALTER JOHNSON

<TEXT>
<P>
Remember way back when the All-Star game was first played in <LOCATION>Orange County</LOCATION>? 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Dave Sommers</PERSON> remembers. He was one of 46,309 fans nestled comfortably in their 
seats at the nearly new <LOCATION>Anaheim Stadium</LOCATION> on <DATE>July 11, 1967</DATE>, when the Big A 
marquee stood right behind the outfield fence and when there was no permanent 
seating behind center field. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Chris Clair</PERSON> remembers. He was there too. He even has a memento of the game, a 
program that sold for <MONEY>50 cents</MONEY> at the gate. This year's All-Star program costs 
<MONEY>$5</MONEY>. 
</P>
<P>
And 89-year-old <PERSON>Ernie Johnson</PERSON> remembers. 
</P>
<P>
But <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> wasn't at <LOCATION>Anaheim Stadium</LOCATION> in <DATE>1967</DATE> when the <ORGANIZATION>National League 
All-Stars</ORGANIZATION> clipped the <ORGANIZATION>American League All-Stars</ORGANIZATION> 2-1 in 15 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson recalls an <LOCATION>Orange County</LOCATION> all-star baseball game a few years earlier -- 
<DATE>1924</DATE> to be exact. That was when a barnstorming team headed by <ORGANIZATION>New York Yankee</ORGANIZATION> 
immortal Babe <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON> played in <LOCATION>Brea</LOCATION> against another touring team captained by 
favorite son <PERSON>Walter Johnson</PERSON> of the <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> Senators, who, like <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON>, ended 
up in the <ORGANIZATION>Hall of Fame</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing I can lay claim to is that I was there when Babe <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON> and 
<PERSON>Walter Johnson</PERSON> played," said <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Brea Canyon Oil Co.</ORGANIZATION> and no 
relation to the illustrious pitcher. "I was quite a follower of <ORGANIZATION>Babe Ruth</ORGANIZATION> and 
<PERSON>Johnson</PERSON>. They put on quite a show." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson the oil man said that <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> the pitcher grew up in <LOCATION>Olinda</LOCATION>, which is 
known today as Yorba Linda. 
</P>
<P>
"He persuaded Babe <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON> to come," <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
On that <DATE>November day nearly 65 years ago</DATE>, <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON> hit a home run off a Johnson 
pitch but another time he went down swinging. "He could throw that ball hard," 
<PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> said of the pitcher. Nevertheless, <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON>'s team won 12-1. 
</P>
<P>
"When Babe <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON> struck at that ball and he missed it, he turned clear around," 
recalled <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON>, one of 5,000 to 16,000 Orange County residents on hand that 
day, depending on which yellowing newspaper account you believe. 
</P>
<P>
"Baseball's quite a thing," <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> concluded. "It attracts a lot of people." 
</P>
<P>
One of those who will resist the attraction of this year's All-Star game is 
Orange County Supervisor <PERSON>Thomas F. Riley</PERSON>. Like <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> and <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> (<PERSON>Walter</PERSON> and 
<PERSON>Ernie</PERSON>, that is), <PERSON>Riley</PERSON> played baseball as a young man and has remained a fan. 
But <PERSON>Riley</PERSON> will miss the midsummer classic in <LOCATION>Anaheim</LOCATION> just as he did in <DATE>1967</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
"Just <TIME>this morning</TIME>, I had a call from a friend who invited me to sit in their 
box," <PERSON>Riley</PERSON> said. "I have tickets, but I'm going to give them to a member of 
the staff. 
</P>
<P>
"I am pretty much of a baseball fan . . . but <PERSON>Emma Jane</PERSON> (his wife) is not such 
an enthusiastic fan. We sort of compromised and will forgo this one." 
</P>
<P>
Had <PERSON>Riley</PERSON> an opportunity to attend the <DATE>1967</DATE> game, however, he would have leaped 
at the chance, he said. At that time he was recently retired from the <ORGANIZATION>Marine 
Corps</ORGANIZATION> and vice president of a <ORGANIZATION>Newport Beach</ORGANIZATION> manufacturing company. 
</P>
<P>
Riley does not recall the hoopla that led up to the <DATE>1967</DATE> game. But he clearly 
has noted the changes in <LOCATION>Orange County</LOCATION> that have taken place since. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of us are still having difficulty with that feeling that we are really 
big boys now," <PERSON>Riley</PERSON> said. "We are really an urban county, second or third 
largest in the state, depending on which day you count." 
</P>
<P>
"We've developed that tremendous stadium. We've really developed a whole lot." 
</P>
<P>
"Don't you think it was kind of a remarkable thing that we had 63,000 people?" 
<PERSON>Riley</PERSON> said of the <DATE>Fourth of July</DATE> crowd at the stadium for the <ORGANIZATION>California 
Angels</ORGANIZATION>' game and fireworks display. 
</P>
<P>
Like <LOCATION>Orange County</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Anaheim Stadium</LOCATION> has grown in the past 22 years. The <DATE>1989</DATE> 
All-Star game is a sellout, but there will be about 17,000 more seats occupied 
this year than at the <DATE>1967</DATE> sellout, a dozen years before the addition of two 
tiers of seating beyond the outfield fences. 
</P>
<P>
Another difference this year is that <PERSON>Genevieve Linhoff</PERSON> plans to see the entire 
game from her seat -- and a choice location it is too, right down in the front 
row, smack behind the <ORGANIZATION>American League</ORGANIZATION> third-base dugout. 
</P>
<P>
In <DATE>1967</DATE>, Linhoff missed about three innings of the game when unexpected 
last-minute emergencies required her to help out in the stadium ticket office 
where she was employed as secretary to the ticket manager. This year she is 
assistant ticket manager. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to be sitting in the seats this time. I'm going to see the whole 
game," <PERSON>Linhoff</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think <LOCATION>Anaheim</LOCATION> has changed" since <DATE>1967</DATE>, <PERSON>Linhoff</PERSON> said. "We were more intimate 
. . . now we're big. Particularly at the stadium. You knew so many of the 
customers. We had fewer people." 
</P>
<P>
Like so many baseball fans, Linhoff is a traditionalist. She wasn't even real 
fond of expanding stadium seating and moving the distinctive Big A from behind 
center field to exile in the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't like that too well, but it's progress, more capacity," she said. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Ernie Johnson</PERSON> recalled how progress altered forever another Orange County 
baseball tradition. 
</P>
<P>
In the early <DATE>1920s</DATE> a large crowd used to gather outside an <LOCATION>Anaheim</LOCATION> coffeehouse, 
where the proprietor kept the baseball-hungry throng posted on play-by-play 
developments of the World Series by relaying telegraph bulletins from the <LOCATION>East</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
On a large board erected outside the eating establishment, the restaurateur had 
denoted bases, the outfield and the players. 
</P>
<P>
"We stood on the opposite side of the street and watched it and sat on the 
curb," <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> recalled. "He got the reports by telegraph, and he played the 
game out." 
</P>
<P>
"He had . . . lights and he'd ring a bell when there was a hit and he'd tell 
who the batter was. He yelled it out through that window." 
</P>
<P>
Alas, progress intervened and in later years radios became commonplace. There 
soon was always someone who would have more up-to-the-minute news than could be 
provided by the quaint coffee-shop scoreboard, <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
"That began to kind of spoil the thing a little bit," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Back to the future. Johnson intends to attend <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>'s All-Star game. Like 
Supervisor <PERSON>Riley</PERSON>, he missed the one in <DATE>1967</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Even if his wife were enthusiastic about attending, <PERSON>Riley</PERSON> has decided that 
considering "the traffic and all involved, I think I'd feel better if I watched 
it at home" on television.

Baseball Stories: Martin, Maris and the Yanks
---
By Joe Mysak</HL>
<DD> 04/08/87</DD>
<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO>
<TEXT>
   Old-timers know that baseball today is not what it was even 30 years ago. 
<PERSON>Billy Martin</PERSON>, who has been building winning ball clubs (and then getting fired from them) over much of this period, tells why. 

   In "BillyBall" (<ORGANIZATION>Doubleday</ORGANIZATION>, 276 pages, <MONEY>$16.95</MONEY>), <PERSON>Mr. Martin</PERSON>, with the help of <ORGANIZATION>New York Daily News</ORGANIZATION> sport columnist <PERSON>Phil Pepe</PERSON>, relates what he's done since the publication of his autobiography, "Number 1," seven years ago. 
Along the way he writes about managers and managing, why infielders often make the best managers, sketches <PERSON>George Steinbrenner</PERSON> and <PERSON>Reggie Jackson</PERSON>, tells how to put together a lineup, and discusses free agents, some old friends and, of course, the old days. 

   At age 60, he is not particularly old as far as managers go, but the game he played as second baseman for the <ORGANIZATION>New York Yankees</ORGANIZATION> during the <DATE>1950s</DATE> had more in common with the game played by <PERSON>John McGraw</PERSON> at the turn of the century than it does with the one played today. 

   Today's player, in <PERSON>Mr. Martin</PERSON>'s opinion, does not spend enough time in the minor leagues learning his trade. 
When he does make the big club, he rooms alone, and does not get the opportunity to talk baseball with a roomie. 
He feels little team loyalty. 
Long-term contracts sap his incentive to perform. 
And if he gets a powerful enough agent, he may be able to get his manager fired or otherwise dictate club policy. 

   Finally, there are the malcontents, who, despite fancy contracts, say they no longer want to play for their team because it is "not fun" anymore, which usually means that they don't like the skipper because he believes in platooning. 
<PERSON>Mr. Martin</PERSON>'s advice: "I wish baseball would just release them. 
Nobody sign the SOBs. 
You don't want to play here? 
You don't like it here? 
Released. 
Go home. 
Go to work. 
You get no more salary, no more having your contract renegotiated, no more calling your agent or the Players' Association for every little thing." 

   The solution, he says, is more one-year contracts for marginal players whose value has been inflated, and a less competitive free-agent market. 
The owners, who can take great responsibility for starting the whole mess, seem to be coming around to these ideas, which is why several familiar faces were not in a uniform on opening day. 

   In contrast with this tale of the preposterous debasement of the national pastime is "Sixty-One" (<ORGANIZATION>Macmillan</ORGANIZATION>, 269 pages, <MONEY>$19.95</MONEY>), by <PERSON>Tony Kubek</PERSON> and <PERSON>Terry Pluto</PERSON>, a history of the sublime <DATE>1961</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>Yankees</ORGANIZATION>, "the most selfless team I've ever managed" in the words of <PERSON>Ralph Houk</PERSON>. 
It is a story of redemption, pursuit and triumph, built around one of the most magnificent feats in baseball. 

   The story belongs to <PERSON>Roger Maris</PERSON> and his pursuit of <PERSON>Babe Ruth</PERSON>'s record 60 home runs in one season. 
Fans tend to root for records to be broken -- but in <DATE>1961</DATE>, they wanted <PERSON>Mickey Mantle</PERSON>, <PERSON>Maris</PERSON>'s teammate, to do it, and in 154 games, the same number of games it had taken <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON>, not the 162 games of the expanded schedule. 
<ORGANIZATION>Ford Frick</ORGANIZATION>, then commissioner of baseball, called attention to the difference between the two records, and rightly so. 
But it does not detract from its heroic quality. 
As <PERSON>Mantle</PERSON> says, "It was something. . . . 
All I know is that no one did it before or since, and I know how damn hard it is to do it, because I tried it and never made it." 

   At the time, however, <PERSON>Maris</PERSON> was subject to abuse from fans, tears from Ruth's widow, attacks from old-timers who contended <PERSON>Maris</PERSON> was unworthy because he was not as colorful as the <LOCATION>Bambino</LOCATION> and was not a .300 hitter, and from newspaper sportswriters who took joy in orchestrating the attack. 
<PERSON>Maris</PERSON> hit his 61, but paid the price, and from all accounts was not the same man afterward. 

   But the story goes beyond <LOCATION>Mickey</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> and ace pitcher <PERSON>Whitey Ford</PERSON> (who won 25 games and lost only four that season) and Babe <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON>'s ghost. 
The fabric of consistent, winning teams is of a finer weave. 
This is a story of great and small, and <PERSON>Mr. Kubek</PERSON>, with the help of sportswriter <LOCATION>Pluto</LOCATION>, makes sure to tell the small. 
It is the story of a team that came back after the heartbreaking loss of the World Series in seven games in <DATE>1960</DATE> to win 109 games in <DATE>1961</DATE>, and to win the series that year in five. 

   It is the story of <PERSON>Ralph Houk</PERSON>, who replaced the legendary <PERSON>Casey Stengel</PERSON> at the helm. 
And it is the story of, among others, the acrobatic third baseman <PERSON>Clete Boyer</PERSON>; utility man <PERSON>Johnny Blanchard</PERSON>, who hit 21 homers, many of them game-winners, in only 243 at bats; and <PERSON>Luis Arroyo</PERSON>, the chubby relief pitcher who went 15-5 with 29 saves and a 2.19 earned run average. 

   It is also the story of <PERSON>Mr. Kubek</PERSON>, who was the shortstop for that team and who is now a commentator for <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION>'s "Game of the Week." 
He tells his story, and his teammates' stories, usually in their own words. 
There are some pretty good ones.

THIS WEEK'S MOVIES

<P>
There may not be baseball this <DATE>spring</DATE> -- thanks to the ongoing dispute between 
owners and players -- but there will be baseball videos to watch. 
</P>
<P>
"The Pride of <LOCATION>St. Louis</LOCATION>" and "The Babe Ruth Story" (both from <ORGANIZATION>CBS/Fox</ORGANIZATION>, <MONEY>$19.98</MONEY> 
each) aren't exactly up to "Bull Durham" in quality, but at least these two 
filmographies from 40 years ago will fill in a few hours with the sound of 
balls hitting bats and fists hitting gloves to comfort TV-game-less addicts. 
</P>
<P>
"The Pride of <LOCATION>St. Louis</LOCATION>" is the better of the two. The <DATE>1952</DATE> film tells the 
story of one of the game's most colorful characters, pitcher (and later <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION> 
announcer) Dizzy Dean. <PERSON>Dan Dailey</PERSON> plays Diz in a movie that doesn't quite 
convince but does entertain. 
</P>
<P>
Even less believable is "The Babe <PERSON>Ruth Story</PERSON>," a flat, whitewashed <DATE>1948</DATE> 
biography of the man who's generally considered the best in the game's history. 
<PERSON>William Bendix</PERSON> is suitably irrepressible as the Babe, but otherwise baseball 
fans will be disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
CBS/Fox is also re-releasing "The Pride of the Yankees" (also <MONEY>$19.98</MONEY>), 
previously available from Key Video. A far better film than the other two, this 
<DATE>1942</DATE> drama starred <PERSON>Gary Cooper</PERSON> as <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON>'s most notable teammate, the great 
slugger <PERSON>Lou Gehrig</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
And coming next week: "Field of Dreams" (<DATE>March 8</DATE>). 
</P>
<P>
Old baseball films aren't the only vintage videos <ORGANIZATION>CBS/Fox</ORGANIZATION> is offering this 
week. Under the banner of "Classic Romances," these four new releases are 
<MONEY>$39.98</MONEY> each: 
</P>
<P>
"Desk Set" (<DATE>1957</DATE>). <PERSON>Spencer Tracy</PERSON> and <PERSON>Katharine Hepburn</PERSON> in a lightweight but 
enjoyable comedy about the introduction of a computer to the research 
department of a business, much to the researchers' dismay. 
</P>
<P>
"Heaven Can Wait" (<DATE>1943</DATE>). Not to be confused with the <PERSON>Warren Beatty</PERSON> movie of 
the same name, this <ORGANIZATION>Ernst Lubitsch</ORGANIZATION> film is an ironic, sophisticated 
comedy/fantasy about a man (<PERSON>Don Ameche</PERSON>) who tells his life story to the devil 
in an attempt to figure out if he's been put in the right place. 
</P>
<P>
"The Ghost and <PERSON>Mrs. Muir</PERSON>" (<DATE>1947</DATE>). More sophisticated comedy -- this time from 
<PERSON>Joseph L. Mankiewicz</PERSON> -- about a young widow (<ORGANIZATION>Gene Tierney</ORGANIZATION>) and the ghost of a 
sea captain (<PERSON>Rex Harrison</PERSON>) who inhabits the house she moves into. 
</P>
<P>
"An Affair to Remember" (<DATE>1957</DATE>). <PERSON>Leo McCarey</PERSON> directed this OK but flawed remake 
of his superior <DATE>1939</DATE> film "Love Affair." <PERSON>Cary Grant</PERSON> and <PERSON>Deborah Kerr</PERSON> help make 
this shipboard comedy palatable. 
</P>
<P>
One other notable oldie, from <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> (<MONEY>$59.95</MONEY>), is "Goodby, My Lady" -- not a 
great film, but a touching and well-made one about a boy (the reliable <PERSON>Brandon 
de Wilde</PERSON>) and his dog. <PERSON>Walter Brennan</PERSON>, <PERSON>Phil Harris</PERSON> and a young <PERSON>Sidney Poitier</PERSON> 
also enliven the sentimental picture. 
</P>
<P>
The newer movies making their way to video this week are considerably less 
interesting, including the silly, unfunny Australian comedy "Young Einstein" 
(<ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION>, <MONEY>$89.95</MONEY>, PG) and the putrid horror sequel "Halloween 5: The Revenge of 
<PERSON>Michael Myers</PERSON>" (<ORGANIZATION>CBS/Fox</ORGANIZATION>, <MONEY>$89.98</MONEY>, R). <PERSON>TERRY ATKINSON</PERSON>

   <PERSON>Dorothy Ruth Pirone</PERSON>, the daughter of
baseball great <PERSON>Babe Ruth</PERSON>, died at home <DATE>Thursday</DATE>. She was 68 years
old.
   Pirone lived in <LOCATION>Durham</LOCATION> for more than a dozen years, where she
raised Arabian horses.
   For most of her life, <PERSON>Pirone</PERSON> was led to believe that her mother
was <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON>'s first wife, <PERSON>Helen</PERSON>, despite rumors to the contrary in the
press.
   In <DATE>1980</DATE>, however, she learned that her real mother was a woman
she had grown up knowing and loving as a close family friend.
<PERSON>Pirone</PERSON> said last year she held no bitterness toward her father for
not revealing her true mother's identity.
   Last year, <PERSON>Pirone</PERSON> wrote a book about her famous father, ``My
Dad, the Babe.'' It was co-authored by <PERSON>Chris Martens</PERSON> and published
on the 40th anniversary of her father's death, <DATE>Aug. 16, 1988</DATE>.
   ``I think I did it more for myself and to show my father was not
the kind of person he was portrayed. I was very defensive of my
father and I can't help it,'' she said in an interview last year.
   Pirone died of natural causes, the family said through a
spokesman at the <ORGANIZATION>B.C. Bailey Funeral Home Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, in <LOCATION>Wallingford</LOCATION>.
   Pirone, wife of the late <PERSON>Dominick L. Pirone</PERSON>, is survived by four
daughters, one son and 12 grandchildren.

<TEXT>
   <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON>, former baseball coach, took time
out <DATE>Friday</DATE> from preparing for his trip to communist <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> to talk
baseball with 4,000 Little Leaguers.
   ``In Little League all that matters is the size of your heart and
of your dreams,'' he said to the kids.
   They were gathered on the <LOCATION>South Lawn</LOCATION>, decked out in uniforms
identifying them as <LOCATION>Indians</LOCATION>, Mets, <LOCATION>Springfield</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Rocco</PERSON>'s Rockettes,
and <ORGANIZATION>Parkland Blue Jays</ORGANIZATION>.
   The purpose was to mark the founding of Little League 50 years
ago in <LOCATION>Williamsport</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pa</LOCATION>. Adding luster to the ceremony were such
baseball greats as <PERSON>Stan Musial</PERSON>, <PERSON>Mike Schmidt</PERSON>, <PERSON>Brooks Robinson</PERSON>, <PERSON>Gary
Carter</PERSON>, <PERSON>Ted Sizemore</PERSON>, <PERSON>Joe Morgan</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jim Palmer</PERSON>.
   The president confessed his baseball hero was <PERSON>Lou Gehrig</PERSON>. And he
recalled that when <PERSON>Babe Ruth</PERSON> presented his papers to <ORGANIZATION>Yale</ORGANIZATION>, the Yalie
who accepted them was none other than <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON>.
   To the young players, <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> repeated a line that Babe <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON>
delivered to a crowd in <LOCATION>Yankee Stadium</LOCATION> when he was dying of cancer:
   ``You know, the only real game in the world, I think, is
baseball. You've got to start from way down when you are 6 or 7
years old and if you try hard enough you're bound to come out on
top.''
   With those words, said the president, <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON> ``defined why Little
League baseball has become an American, indeed, an international
institution.
   ``My four boys played it, I coached it, and <PERSON>Barbara</PERSON> _ not many
non baseball players could properly score a baseball games, but
<PERSON>Barbara</PERSON> did that, inning after inning,'' <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> said.
   ``Like you, I know what makes Little League so special. It's a
feeling of sportsmanship, generosity, teamwork, a feeling of family,
fathers and daughters, mothers and sons.''
   He said in the 50 years, 20 million youngsters had played Little
League _ more than 2.5 million in 33 nations this year alone.
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> told the crowd that when he is in <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION> next week, he will
have the pleasure of helping import Little League. And he said he
will tell about <PERSON>Musial</PERSON> and <PERSON>Carl Yastrzemski</PERSON>, both baseball greats of
Polish extraction.
   ``In Little League all that matters is the size of your heart and
of your dreams and ask these kids about it,'' <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> said. ``Dreams
are the essence of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> and of baseball and Little League can
propel those dreams.
   ``In the end what matters is how we conduct ourselves on as well
as off the field. That's where Little league really connects, by
building courage and character. It belts a grandslam home run by
doing those two things.''

   A lock of <LOCATION>George Washington</LOCATION>'s hair fetched <MONEY>$2,750</MONEY>
at an auction of celebrity memorabilia <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, which also
featured a package of letters written by mass murderers and <PERSON>Adolf
Hitler</PERSON>.
   The lock from the nation's first president went to a bidder,
who, like the other buyers and the sellers, requested anonymity
from the DuMouchelles auction house in <LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION>, said auctioneer <PERSON>Joe
DuMouchelle</PERSON>.
   The collection of letters from <PERSON>John Wayne Gacy</PERSON>, <PERSON>David Berkowitz</PERSON>,
<PERSON>Charles Manson</PERSON> and Hitler brought <MONEY>$700</MONEY>.
   Fecthing the highest price was Babe <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON>'s 700th home-run
baseball, sold for <MONEY>$9,300</MONEY> by a <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> buyer, said DuMouchelle,
whose family owns the auction house.
   An autographed photograph of <PERSON>Marilyn Monroe</PERSON>, who died in <DATE>1962</DATE>,
brought <MONEY>$5,000</MONEY>, the robe worn by <PERSON>Sylvester Stallone</PERSON> in ``Rocky
III'' sold for <MONEY>$2,400</MONEY>, and a pair of silk boxer shorts once owned
by actor <PERSON>Jack Nicholson</PERSON> went for <MONEY>$700</MONEY>.
   Two art deco etchings by <PERSON>Louis Icart</PERSON> sold for <MONEY>$7,000</MONEY> and <MONEY>$6,500</MONEY>
each, the auctioneer said.
   The items were auctioned off in estate sales and the
standing-room only crowd of bidders came from across the nation,
DuMouchelle said.
   Manson is serving a life prison term for the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> murders
of starlet <ORGANIZATION>Sharon Tate</ORGANIZATION> and six others by members of his cult
``family'' in <DATE>1969</DATE>; <PERSON>Gacy</PERSON> was convicted in <DATE>1980</DATE> of the sex-related

<LEADPARA>  PERHAPS because of baseball's longevity, or maybe because of its association
with childhood summers, the sport thrives on nostalgia. It's a game many of us
can regard with soul-warming affection, even if we didn't play it well. By
definition, then, a videocassette called "Baseball's Greatest Moments" (60
minutes, $19.95) is destined to find a receptive audience.;    The tape also
happens to be a production of Major League Baseball Home Video, giving it that
"official" cachet. The viewer can rest assured the best available game footage
was used.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Eye  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  THE BOYS OF SUMMER AND THEIR GREATEST HITS  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  VIDEO  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> focus;    The tape limits itself to 20 "greatest moments," which
fill an hour nicely but also will spark disappointment among partisans who
have their own ideas of greatness. The relative merits of specific plays can
be argued endlessly by fans (and in fact they are, to the game's enrichment),
so your own favorite may have to wait for an enlightened sequel.;    For the
time being, however, it's fair to say that fans of the <ORGANIZATION>Yankees</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Dodgers and
Giants</ORGANIZATION> will find themselves particularly well-served. Among the players
extolled here are Babe <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON>, <PERSON>Lou Gehrig</PERSON>, <PERSON>Joe DiMaggio</PERSON>, <PERSON>Jackie Robinson</PERSON>, <PERSON>Willie
Mays</PERSON>, <PERSON>Bobby Thomson</PERSON>, <PERSON>Don Larsen</PERSON>, <PERSON>Roger Maris</PERSON> and <PERSON>Reggie Jackson</PERSON>. The rest of
the country may wonder why <ORGANIZATION>MLB</ORGANIZATION> Home Video didn't call the tape "<LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>
Baseball's Greatest Moments.";    Starting with <PERSON>Babe Ruth</PERSON>'s "called shot"
homer in <DATE>1932</DATE> and ending with <PERSON>Nolan Ryan</PERSON>'s sixth no-hitter just last year,
each historic moment is preceded by a title screen describing the event and
date. The titles are set inside of picture frames, and signature scenes from
each event are glorified with special video treatment that renders
painting-like images.;    The narration supplies the context leading up to the
crucial action -- <PERSON>Mays</PERSON>' over-the-shoulder catch in <DATE>1954</DATE>, <PERSON>Larsen</PERSON>'s perfect game
in the <DATE>1956</DATE> World Series, <PERSON>Maris</PERSON>' 61st home run, <PERSON>Pete Rose</PERSON>'s 4,192th career hit
and so on.;    Looking back;    Where possible, each is followed by the
comments of players or managers as they are today, looking back at the moment.
These scenes can be powerfully moving, such as <PERSON>Maris</PERSON>' recollection of feeling
embarrassed about stepping out of the dugout to take a bow after he broke
<PERSON>Ruth</PERSON>'s home-run record, or <PERSON>Harvey Haddix</PERSON> still smiling at the fates who took a
game away from him even after he had pitched 12 perfect innings.;    "Greatest
Moments" is not limited to actual hits, runs and errors. Also shown are
<PERSON>Gehrig</PERSON>'s farewell speech in <DATE>1939</DATE> (coupled with <PERSON>DiMaggio</PERSON>'s reflection on that
day) as well as the arrival of <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> in the major leagues. <PERSON>Leo Durocher</PERSON>
recalls the very unwelcoming attitude of his Dodgers and his own words of
advice: "You'd better get used to it, boys."  </TEXT>

<TEXT>     Speaking from <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Wrigley Field</LOCATION> during filming of a re-enactment of
the <DATE>1932</DATE> World Series, <PERSON>Fusco</PERSON> said of his star, "John's transformation has been
uncanny. He lost about 60 pounds for the role. He went through a rigorous
training period to learn to execute a Ruthian swing -- an incredibly powerful
left-handed swing. He does Ruth's classic home run trot. He's got his speech
mannerisms down pat. Sometimes it's spooky. Even now, in our seventh week of
production, he's constantly studying footage of the Babe in his trailer. It's
<PERSON>John</PERSON>'s first dramatic starring role -- and he's shown an incredible level of
concentration.";    "The Babe," slated for release at the beginning of next
year's baseball season, is scheduled to complete production the end of the
month -- just days before <PERSON>Goodman</PERSON>'s "Roseanne" series revs up for the new
season.;  NEW WOMEN: "Designing Women" starts new season production <DATE>July 29</DATE>,
with a story that will incorporate new "Women" <PERSON>Julia Duffy</PERSON> and Jan Hooks into
the cast. Gone, of course, is battlin' <PERSON>Delta Burke</PERSON>, who's been dropped from
the show, and <PERSON>Jean Smart</PERSON>'s only going to be around for an occasional episode.
"Jean will do the first couple," says producer <PERSON>Harry Thomason</PERSON>, "and then we'll
play it by ear." Hooks will be playing Smart's sister, recently divorced from
the biggest mobile home dealer in the <LOCATION>Southwest</LOCATION>. Duffy will come aboard as a
cousin to <PERSON>Dixie Carter</PERSON> and <PERSON>Burke</PERSON>'s <PERSON>Sugarbaker</PERSON> sisters.;  PLAYING GODDESS:
<PERSON>Susan Griffiths</PERSON>, who wrapped work as <PERSON>Marilyn Monroe</PERSON> in <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION>'s "Marilyn &amp; Me"
movie earlier this month, is already girding herself for the critical flogging
she figures could come when the production airs this <DATE>fall</DATE>. "I'm kind of
putting myself on the chopping block by doing this," admits the 26-year-old
actress, who's playing 20ish <PERSON>Norma Jean Baker</PERSON> (<PERSON>Monroe</PERSON>) in the movie detailing
the relationship between the screen icon and writer <PERSON>Bob Slatzer</PERSON> -- who claims
to have been <PERSON>Monroe</PERSON>'s second husband. "I hope the movie's taken for what it
is, a beautiful love story -- whether or not they believe <PERSON>Bob</PERSON>'s account," says
<PERSON>Griffiths</PERSON> (who does). No matter how "Marilyn &amp; Me" is received, she doesn't
plan to continue playing <PERSON>Monroe</PERSON> after it airs. Having made a part-time career
as a <PERSON>Monroe</PERSON> look-alike since age 17 -- with three Japanese commercials, a
Vegas stage act, and now, the <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION> telepic -- "I've done it. I can't imagine
playing her in anything better than '<ORGANIZATION>Marilyn &amp; Me</ORGANIZATION>' -- and I'd really like to
do more as myself now.";  By <PERSON>St. Clair Pugh</PERSON> and <PERSON>Denis Ferrara</PERSON> for <PERSON>Liz Smith</PERSON> in

their <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> stage debuts. Zimbalist and <PERSON>Purl</PERSON> will star in <PERSON>Jane Anderson</PERSON>'s

<P>
It was at this point in <DATE>spring</DATE> training, 20 years ago, that he stood before the 
microphones set up I in the <ORGANIZATION>Yankees</ORGANIZATION>' hotel suite and said: "I can't hit the 
ball anymore, and I can't steal second when I need to anymore, and I can't go 
from first to third anymore . . . and I think it's time to quit trying." 
</P>
<P>
He also might have said, and he wouldn't be lying, that no more would he be 
hitting the league's most and longest homers, or winning any more <ORGANIZATION>MVP</ORGANIZATION> awards of 
which there were three, and he wouldn't be scoring the most runs anymore, or 
driving in the most, and no more would he be the best drag bunter in baseball. 
Things like that. 
</P>
<P>
This, of course, was <PERSON>Mickey Mantle</PERSON>, saying goodby to the game that made him 
famous, and vice versa. He was telling the <ORGANIZATION>Yankees</ORGANIZATION>' management and the rest of 
the world that, at 37, he was packing it in, surrendering at last to the enemy 
of all his baseball years, his sorely abused, crybaby knees. 
</P>
<P>
They had plagued him since his rookie year with the <ORGANIZATION>Yankees</ORGANIZATION> when, in the second 
game of the <DATE>1951</DATE> World Series, he stepped into a drainage hole, twisted a knee, 
and was carried from the field on a stretcher, never to return to that series. 
</P>
<P>
He would later hit more World Series home runs, 18, than any man of his time, 
or before, or since. This was the <PERSON>Mickey Mantle</PERSON> who was now saying he couldn't 
play the game anymore. A giant was leaving the baseball scene. 
</P>
<P>
Always there were discussions about who hit the longest homers, usually with 
the agreement that <PERSON>Babe Ruth</PERSON> was No. 1. It was <PERSON>Walter Johnson</PERSON> who once put 
Ruth's homers in perspective when he was asked to compare <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jimmie Foxx</PERSON> 
and <PERSON>Hank Greenberg</PERSON>. Whose hits were the longest? Said <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON>: "All I can say 
is that the balls <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON> hit out of the park got smaller quicker than anybody 
else's." 
</P>
<P>
So where did <PERSON>Mantle</PERSON> fit in? In all his years <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON> never hit one over the high, 
concrete bleachers in left center field in <LOCATION>Griffith Stadium</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>. But 
of course he hit left-handed. <PERSON>Greenberg</PERSON> and <PERSON>Foxx</PERSON> had their shots at it, and it 
never happened. But one <DATE>April</DATE> afternoon in <DATE>1955</DATE>, against the Senators' <PERSON>Chuck 
Stobbs</PERSON>, <PERSON>Mickey Mantle</PERSON> made it happen. By yards and yards his swat cleared those 
bleachers and sailed into Fifth Street beyond. After a measuring they came up 
with the opinion it was a masterly 565-foot production. 
</P>
<P>
The late <PERSON>Clark Griffith</PERSON>, owner of the Senators, put the <PERSON>Mantle</PERSON> homer in 
perspective when it was suggested to him that a prevailing wind helped the 
shot. "Consarn it, I don't care about that," <PERSON>Griffith</PERSON> said. "That same wind has 
been blowing for 100 years, and nobody else ever hit one out of there." 
</P>
<P>
When <PERSON>Mantle</PERSON> quit he didn't say that another Yankee dynasty had ended, because 
he didn't talk in those terms, but he could have. His had been the latest of 
the Yankee eras, in which one majestic performer had carried the team. First, 
it was the Babe <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON> era, then the longtime <PERSON>Joe DiMaggio</PERSON> phase of the <ORGANIZATION>Yankees</ORGANIZATION>. 
To whom would the torch be passed? Who could qualify for the greatness of the 
role? He would answer to the name of <PERSON>Mickey Mantle</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
He had come to the Yankees as the shy kid from the <LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION> sandlots, with a 
blond cowlick, and offering his uncommon combination of muscle plus speed. He 
had also licked, he thought, a boyhood bout with the bone disease, 
osteomyelitis. In high school he had played football, too, and in later years a 
teammate who had remembered him then said of <PERSON>Mantle</PERSON>'s speed, "Despite his good 
weight, he was lightfooted. It seemed he ran on top of the grass." 
</P>
<P>
Four times he led the AL in homers, but ironically he didn't in his most 
productive year when he slammed 54. That was when teammate <PERSON>Roger Maris</PERSON> hit 
those 61 to break Ruth's record. Some folks tried to make a thing of rivalry 
between <PERSON>Mantle</PERSON> and <PERSON>Maris</PERSON> that season, but <LOCATION>Mickey</LOCATION> was having none of it. "<PERSON>Roger</PERSON> 
is my friend," he said. "If I don't hit 61, I hope he does." 
</P>
<P>
He didn't need a home run to establish him as the home run giant of his times. 
Remembered is the <DATE>1956</DATE> World Series against <LOCATION>Brooklyn</LOCATION>, when a total of 16 homers 
were hit by all the players. Three were by <PERSON>Mantle</PERSON>. Those three were the longest 
three of the Series. 
</P>
<P>
He was the rarest combination of home run slugger and deft bunter who ever hit 
the big leagues. His specialty was the drag bunt, a thing of beauty in itself 
and now threatening to become a lost art. He could manage it with his hands and 
speed, when, as a switch hitter he chose to bat left-handed. From manager <PERSON>Casey 
Stengel</PERSON>, he had a blank check to drag one whenever he liked. On a two-strike 
count even. It would be risky, if not damn foolishness, for anybody else. 
</P>
<P>
A few years ago <PERSON>Mickey</PERSON> arrived in the <ORGANIZATION>Yankees</ORGANIZATION>' camp as a hitting instructor, 
met an old friend, and inquired about his golf game. In turn, <PERSON>Mantle</PERSON>, now a 
golf fanatic, was asked about his own game. "I'm hitting the ball well but I 
can't score," he said. What was wrong? "It's my putting," <PERSON>Mantle</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
In a bases-loaded, two-strike situation in the ninth with the 60,000 in the 
park on the edge of their seats in high excitement, <PERSON>Mantle</PERSON> always seemed the 
calmest fellow in the place with the bat on his shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
"So, <LOCATION>Mickey</LOCATION>, what's wrong with your putting?" he was asked. "Hell," <PERSON>Mickey</PERSON> 
said, "I'm gutless." In addition to making a commentary on golf, he seemed to 
be saying baseball was his game.

@  Cubs Fan Recalls Babe's 'Called Shot'

<TEXT>
   I am sitting with <PERSON>Stanley Kuttner</PERSON> in the family room of his home, watching the baseball game on television. 
The first-place <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> Cubs are playing the <ORGANIZATION>Montreal Expos</ORGANIZATION>. 
It's the fifth inning, the score is tied at zero, and the Cubs have put runners on second and third bases with none out. 
But the next batter pops out and the next strikes out, and it looks like the Cubs will come up empty. 

   Then Expo catcher <PERSON>Nelson Santovenia</PERSON> lets a low, outside pitch get past him to the screen, and the Cubs score after all. 
That's the kind of season it's been. 
The TV screen records the <LOCATION>Wrigley Field</LOCATION> bedlam, and also flashes the news that the <LOCATION>Pittsburgh Pirates</LOCATION> have gone ahead of the second-place <ORGANIZATION>St. Louis Cardinals</ORGANIZATION>, 5-0, in <LOCATION>St. Louis</LOCATION>. 
If the Cubs win and Cards lose (as it turns out they do), the Cubs would be 4 1/2 games ahead with 17 games to play in the <ORGANIZATION>National League East</ORGANIZATION>, the TV voice whoops. 

   We sit quietly. 
When the noise subsides, I ask Stanley if he thinks the Cubs can do it -- that is, win the pennant. 
A long pause ensues. 
"I don't know. 
They're the Cubs," he says finally. 
"But maybe the other teams are worse this year." 

   Such phlegm and caution is bred of experience. 
Stanley is 73 years old, and a lifelong Cubs fan. 
He knows better than most that, down the years, the team has been far more the done-unto than the doer. 
He was there when the Cubs established their reputation as baseball's all-time patsies. 
Yes, he was there, a short, wiry 16-year-old in the right-field bleachers at <LOCATION>Wrigley Field</LOCATION>, on <DATE>Oct. 1, 1932</DATE>, when the great <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> Yankee slugger <PERSON>Babe Ruth</PERSON>, goaded by the <ORGANIZATION>Cubs</ORGANIZATION>' bench, was said to have pointed toward the center-field seats and then hit a prodigious home run to the same spot. 

   The homer is the basis of baseball's most lustrious legend, which only has been magnified by the 57-year debate over whether Ruth really called his shot. 
With the Cubs again courting playoff or World Series disaster, the time seemed ripe for a revisit. 
You were there, <ORGANIZATION>Stanley</ORGANIZATION>. 
Did The Babe point? 

   Before I reveal his answer, let me assure you that <PERSON>Kuttner</PERSON> is not some old guy who has been sitting around his family room, waiting to talk about something that happened -- or didn't happen -- in <DATE>1932</DATE>. 
Still wiry and still short, he is a man of parts and participations, a husband, father of five daughters and granddad of eight. 
Growing up on <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>North Side</LOCATION>, he played American Legion baseball against <PERSON>Phil Cavarretta</PERSON>, later the first baseman and leader of the <ORGANIZATION>Cubs</ORGANIZATION>' last pennant winner, in <DATE>1945</DATE>. 
Stanley played second base for one team, <PERSON>Cavarretta</PERSON> pitched for another. 
Stanley did not get a hit off <PERSON>Cavarretta</PERSON>. 

   He served in the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> during World War II, mopping up after the Marines on <LOCATION>Guadalcanal</LOCATION> and storming the beaches of <LOCATION>New Georgia</LOCATION> in the <LOCATION>Solomons</LOCATION>. 
I asked if he had any war stories. 
He said he had one. 

   "They sent me home in <DATE>1944</DATE> to guard prisoners at Camp McCoy in <LOCATION>Wisconsin</LOCATION>," he says. 
"I met a Japanese prisoner who spoke some English. 
He told me he'd been shot on <LOCATION>New Georgia</LOCATION>. 
I told him I'd shot him. 
We both had a good laugh." 

   After the war, he joined the <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> advertising firm started by his two brothers and sister. 
He retired as a partner three years ago. 
When golf, tennis and bowling paled, he sought part-time work. 
"The woman at the employment agency asked me what I could do. 
I told her I couldn't do anything -- I'd been an executive," he says. 
He now does odd office jobs for a suburban newspaper chain, in addition to playing golf and tennis, and bowling. 

   He also watches baseball, but not as much as before. 
"The game takes too long now," he says. 
"In the old days, games started at <TIME>3 p.m.</TIME> and ended around 4:30. 
Now they start at <TIME>1:30</TIME> and they're still playing at 4:30." 
So he watches mostly on TV, and can do other things when he gets antsy. 

   As a kid, though, he considered baseball a supreme treat. 
"My family always lived around <LOCATION>Wrigley Field</LOCATION>," he recalls. 
"We lived at <LOCATION>Beacon</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Montrose</LOCATION>, and on <PERSON>Ainslie</PERSON>, and later at <ORGANIZATION>Diversey</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Pine Grove</LOCATION>. 
Some of the Cubs lived in hotels around <ORGANIZATION>Diversey</ORGANIZATION>, too, and I got to know them. 
When Dizzy Dean was with the team, he and I and <PERSON>Billy Herman</PERSON> and his brother-in-law went drinking one night. 
I was only 21 or 22, but I held my liquor better than Dean did. 

   "My brother, <PERSON>Chester</PERSON>, and I went to lots of games when we were teen-agers. 
Sometimes we'd go after school, sometimes instead of school. . . . 
Naturally, when the Cubs won the pennant in <DATE>1932</DATE>, we wanted to see a World Series game," he goes on. 
"The first one in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> was on a <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, and <PERSON>Chester</PERSON> and I got to the ballpark <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> to get in line for tickets. 
We stayed there all night. 
We got good seats, but we were mad because other people showed up at 9 or <TIME>10 a.m.</TIME> on <DATE>Saturday</DATE> and did nearly as well. 

   "I remember a lot about the game. 
There were several homers. 
Ruth hit one in the first inning. 
The Cubs hit a couple. 
Ruth came up again in the fifth. 
You could see him looking into the Cubs' dugout, moving his head like he was talking to them. 
Then he waved his bat toward the bleachers and hit his home run. 
When he rounded the bases, you could see him talking to the Cubs some more. 

   "I didn't think any more of it right then. 
It wasn't like everybody was talking about how he pointed, and then hit one. 
But later, when I read things about the 'called shot,' I thought, 'Yeah, that's what he did.'" 

   I felt obliged to mention that most writers who had delved into the incident had concluded that <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON> hadn't pointed, with bat or hand. 
<PERSON>Robert Creamer</PERSON>, in his wonderful biography of <ORGANIZATION>The Babe</ORGANIZATION>, sifted press accounts of the game and found only one that specifically said he had. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Stanley Kuttner</ORGANIZATION> is unimpressed. 
"Sportswriters don't know everything," he notes, correctly. 
"Anyway," he smiles, "it's a better story my way, don't you think?"

JIM MURRAY: OLD-TIMER STRIKES BACK AT COMPUTER

<TEXT>
<P>
In <DATE>1930</DATE>, something like 57 <ORGANIZATION>National League</ORGANIZATION> batters batted over .300. One of 
them batted .401. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, only four <ORGANIZATION>National League</ORGANIZATION> batters hit over .300. The league champion 
hit .313. 
</P>
<P>
In <DATE>1930</DATE>, every member of the champion <ORGANIZATION>St. Louis Cardinals</ORGANIZATION> starting lineup 
batted over .300. Last year, most teams didn't have any batters over .300. 
</P>
<P>
The late <PERSON>Fresco Thompson</PERSON> used to recall ruefully the year he hit .324 for the 
<LOCATION>Philadelphia Phillies</LOCATION> -- and batted eighth. 
</P>
<P>
In <DATE>1930</DATE>, the year <PERSON>Bill Terry</PERSON> batted .401, the second-place hitter, <PERSON>Babe Herman</PERSON>, 
batted .393. The third-place hitter, <PERSON>Chuck Klein</PERSON>, batted .386, fourth was Lefty 
O'Doul at .383 and fifth was <PERSON>Fred Lindstrom</PERSON> at .379. Terry got 254 hits, <PERSON>Klein</PERSON>, 
250 and <PERSON>Herman</PERSON>, 241. 
</P>
<P>
The most hits in the <ORGANIZATION>National League</ORGANIZATION> last year was <PERSON>Andre Galarraga</PERSON>'s 184. 
</P>
<P>
Hack <PERSON>Wilson</PERSON> drove in 190 runs for the <ORGANIZATION>Chicago Cubs</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1930</DATE>. The league leader 
last year was <PERSON>Will Clark</PERSON> of <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> with 109. 
</P>
<P>
What happened? Were there giants in those days, runts in this? 
</P>
<P>
Baseball scholars have been uneasy with these figures, this discrepancy, for 
years. It is not possible for them to conclude that the batters of a 
half-century ago were that much better than those of today. There must be an 
illogical explanation. 
</P>
<P>
Their "explanation" makes <PERSON>Bill Starr</PERSON> see red. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Bill Starr</PERSON> is not a nostalgia buff. <PERSON>Bill Starr</PERSON> is not one of those 
Ty-Cobb-was-better-than-Pete-Rose guys. <PERSON>Bill Starr</PERSON> was an owner of the <LOCATION>San 
Diego Padres</LOCATION> in the <DATE>'40s</DATE> and '50s before the major leagues came to <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>. 
He was a player in the <DATE>'30s</DATE>, briefly a catcher for the old <ORGANIZATION>Washington Senators</ORGANIZATION> 
(now the <LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION> Twins). 
</P>
<P>
Starr's outrage is not directed at those who would say that today's players are 
as good as yesterday's. He concedes that. What brings him off the wall is the 
notion promoted by those who would hold that yesterday's players were no good 
-- and that they can prove it with computers. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, the pitchers couldn't get them out. But the computers blow them 
away. Starr has written a book titled "Clearing The Bases -- Baseball Then And 
Now," and he points to the following paragraph taken from another book ("The 
Hidden Game Of Baseball") as an example of rewriting history by floppy disk. 
"If <PERSON>Ty Cobb</PERSON>'s career had taken place . . . in <DATE>1976</DATE>," those authors have 
written, "his lifetime B.A. (which was actually .367) would have been only 
.289. <ORGANIZATION>Rogers Hornsby</ORGANIZATION> (lifetime .358) and <PERSON>Joe DiMaggio</PERSON> (lifetime .325) would 
have achieved identical .280 marks. <PERSON>Bill Terry</PERSON>, <PERSON>Lou Gehrig</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Tris Speaker</ORGANIZATION> 
would be average to mediocre hitters at .271, .269 and .265, respectively. The 
Babe's (Ruth's) .262 (Babe actually hit .342) would be a disappointment, though 
better than <PERSON>Al Simmons</PERSON>' .260 (Al hit .334 with the bat but not the bytes) or 
<PERSON>Honus Wagner</PERSON>'s .251 (<PERSON>Honus</PERSON> had better luck in person, too, .329)." 
</P>
<P>
While conceding that <DATE>1930</DATE> was a bumper year for base hits (the <ORGANIZATION>National League</ORGANIZATION> 
batted .303 for that year while last year's average was .248), <PERSON>Starr</PERSON> blames the 
decline in hitting on a number of observable (not computerized) phenomenas, 
most notably the strikeout. It's become endemic in the big leagues. Big 
leaguers struck out 25,098 times in <DATE>1987</DATE>, compared to a two-league average of 
only 7,517 in the '20s and <DATE>'30s</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
"The modern ballplayer seems to have no knowledge of the strike zone," <PERSON>Starr</PERSON> 
laments. "Babe <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON> had a big reputation as a striker-outer, but he struck out 
only 79 times a year on the average. DiMaggio struck out only 27, <PERSON>Ted Williams</PERSON> 
only 46. Gehrig struck out only 49, even homer sluggers such as <PERSON>Mel Ott</PERSON> struck 
out only 48 a year. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Reggie Jackson</PERSON> averaged 129 a year and put the strikeout record 600 above 
everyone else. He struck out 171 times one year. Wilver <PERSON>Stargell</PERSON> struck out 122 
times a year. <PERSON>Mickey Mantle</PERSON> struck out an average of 105 times a year, and <PERSON>Mike 
Schmidt</PERSON> strikes out 117. Babe <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON> isn't even in the top 25 in lifetime 
strikeouts anymore. 
</P>
<P>
Starr disputes the notion a strikeout is "a nice clean out." It doesn't result 
in a double play or worse, it's not as humiliating as a popup. But, says <PERSON>Starr</PERSON>, 
"It kills a rally. It raises the morale of the pitcher. Nothing is more 
counter-productive to the winning of a game." 
</P>
<P>
Starr points out that "in <DATE>1987</DATE>, there were 41 players who struck out more than 
100 times. By comparison, in the entire <DATE>20 years from 1920 through 1939</DATE>, 100 or 
more strikeouts occurred only 10 times." He points out that <ORGANIZATION>Cobb</ORGANIZATION> only struck 
out 24 times the year he hit .401 and that <PERSON>George Sisler</PERSON> struck out only 14 
times the year he hit .420. 
</P>
<P>
Babe <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON> never struck out 100 times. <PERSON>Reggie Jackson</PERSON> had 100 or more strikeouts 
18 times in his career. "That's why he only batted .263," <PERSON>Starr</PERSON> explains. 
Mantle fanned more than 100 times eight seasons and more than 90 in four 
others. 
</P>
<P>
Starr takes issue with the notion a lively ball produced the orgy of base hits 
in <DATE>1930</DATE>. Starr argues that the goal of baseball was never to "juice up" a 
baseball, only to make it more uniform. He says, on the contrary, that after 
<DATE>1930</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>National League</ORGANIZATION> changed the cork center of the ball and raised the 
seams, which resulted in a dramatic drop in that league's offense (Hack <PERSON>Wilson</PERSON> 
went from 56 homers to 13 and from 190 RBIs to 61 but bathtub gin may have had 
as much to do with it as baseballs). And it turned the <ORGANIZATION>National League</ORGANIZATION> into a 
curveball league that really wasn't competitive with the power-hitting <ORGANIZATION>American 
League</ORGANIZATION> for decades. 
</P>
<P>
Starr thinks, in addition to not knowing the strike zone, players are not 
seasoned in the minor leagues the way they used to be -- and should be. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, <PERSON>Bill Starr</PERSON> takes on the computer rewriters of history on a 
You-had-to-be-there basis. He points out, for example, that Pythagorean 
principles don't apply to psychological factors. 
</P>
<P>
"<PERSON>Jackie Robinson</PERSON> was a comparable example. His batting statistics were not 
overwhelming, and he hardly rated among the most outstanding defensive players 
in baseball history. But he, like <PERSON>Cobb</PERSON>, was an intimidator on the basepaths. He 
put pressure on the opposition, he compelled defensive changes in their play. 
Infielders were made to move closer to their bags, thus producing larger holes 
in the infield. To prevent <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> from stealing, pitchers were compelled to 
alter their natural deliveries and selection of pitches. All of this favored 
the hitters on his club." Computers cannot pick this up, he argues. 
</P>
<P>
Bill proves his point convincingly. But, you don't really need a book when 
someone comes up to you with a whole bunch of printouts to tell you Babe <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON> 
would only hit .262 and <PERSON>Honus Wagner</PERSON>, .251. All you really have to do is say, 
"Gid oudda here!"

UNCLAIMED BOXES: GOING, GOING, SOLD

<P>
The contents of safe deposit boxes left dormant for five years got new life 
<DATE>Monday</DATE>, when they were sold at a state-run auction presided over by <ORGANIZATION>State 
Controller Gray Davis</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The highlight of the auction, held in <LOCATION>West Hollywood</LOCATION>, came early in the 
proceedings when <LOCATION>Beverly Hills</LOCATION> art dealer <PERSON>Louis Stern</PERSON> plunked down <MONEY>$2,500</MONEY> for a 
baseball autographed by <ORGANIZATION>Babe Ruth</ORGANIZATION>. He hopes to sell it to a <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> real estate 
magnate who is creating a baseball museum. 
</P>
<P>
The ball was one of 1,200 lots for sale. Other items included an autographed 
picture of the Beatles (which went for <MONEY>$80</MONEY>), coins, jewelry and trinkets. The 
total appraised value of the lots was <MONEY>$150,000</MONEY>. Information on the total amount 
raised was not immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
After trying to locate box owners through Social Security and driver's license 
records and by taking out newspaper advertisements for at least a year, the 
contents of the boxes were put on sale, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Sale proceeds for each item will be held for the rightful owners or their 
heirs," <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> said. Until claimed, the money is invested and held in the 
state's General Fund. 
</P>
<P>
Through periodic auctions, the controller's office hopes to bring attention to 
the approximately <MONEY>$520 million</MONEY> in unclaimed property and assets that the state 
currently holds, <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
"One out of every seven people living in the state have something owed to them 
by our office. The odds are much better than winning at Lotto." 
</P>
<P>
For information about unclaimed property, call 800-992-4647. JOHN H. LEE

<LEADPARA>  AS contract hassles and walkout threats pollute the major league baseball
scene, it's refreshing to know there's one local success at the college level
who hasn't forgotten his loyalty or roots.;    Jackie Nickell, a 1987 Gunn
High graduate, pitches for the University of Southern California baseball
team. He returns this weekend to Sunken Diamond, where he handed Stanford its
only home loss of the 1990 Pacific-10 Conference season, a 3-2 verdict last
May.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Peninsula Extra  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  GUNN HIGH GRAD RETURNS TO HIS ROOTS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     The victory comes secondary to another feat that happened that day.;   
Sure, it was the ultimate homecoming, to beat the nation's third-best team
while snapping its 18-game home win streak before 2,351 fans.;    Winning
before relatives and friends would seem like the perfect time for a grand
celebration, a night on the town.;    But <PERSON>Nickell</PERSON> kept his victory in
perspective.;    He simply celebrated by helping his father, <PERSON>Rory</PERSON>, coach his
Babe <PERSON>Ruth League</PERSON> team for a few innings before leaving to grab a bite and
return to the hotel before curfew.;    "He just showed up," <PERSON>Rory Nickell</PERSON> said.
"I hadn't even thought about it.";    The younger <PERSON>Nickell</PERSON> attracted Will
Clark-like attention from the younger players but downplayed his presence.;   
"I just watched the starting pitcher get loose and coached one of the bases,"
<PERSON>Jackie Nickell</PERSON> said.;    He was asked a lot of questions and showed the
leadership of a veteran, providing tips to the youngsters.;    "A lot of them
liked to ask about playing <ORGANIZATION>Stanford</ORGANIZATION>. I told them it was great. I showed the
pitchers what they can do within the boundaries (of the rules).";    <ORGANIZATION>Nickell</ORGANIZATION>
chuckled while completing the final sentence. While I sensed that he was
willing to give inside tips had the pitchers reached adulthood, he clearly
enjoyed spending the precious time he had.;    It's not the first time <PERSON>Nickell</PERSON>
has done this. He said he makes an effort to help his father's team when the
Trojans visit the <LOCATION>Bay Area</LOCATION> and Dad's team is playing.;    Father and son admit
it's tough to see each other during baseball season. Last season, <PERSON>Papa
Nickell</PERSON>'s only chance to see son <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> play came at <ORGANIZATION>Stanford</ORGANIZATION>. Making a living
and coaching a <ORGANIZATION>Babe Ruth</ORGANIZATION> team don't leave much free time.;    "Last year, it
was a tossup between the <ORGANIZATION>College World Series</ORGANIZATION> (in <LOCATION>Omaha</LOCATION>) and getting my team
over a bad hump," <PERSON>Rory Nickell</PERSON> recalled.;    <PERSON>Rory Nickell</PERSON> didn't have to make
that decision when the Trojans, a game away from the <ORGANIZATION>CWS</ORGANIZATION>, lost two straight to
host <LOCATION>Louisiana State</LOCATION> in the double-elimination South I Regional and were
denied a trip to Omaha.;    But there was no summer break for <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON>. He went
to play in the <LOCATION>Cape Cod League</LOCATION> and posted a 5-2 record with a 1.74 earned run
average, fifth best in the league.;    "I wish I was closer to my parents,"
<PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> said last week. "But I enjoy what I'm doing.";    And there's plenty of
fun this season. As of <DATE>last week</DATE>, <PERSON>Nickell</PERSON> posted a 4-3 record with wins over
<LOCATION>Stanford</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION>. The Trojans remained in first place in the Six-Pac with an
11-1 record and were ranked second in two college baseball polls.;    Although
the Babe <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON> season is more than a month away, <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> hasn't forgotten his
role as a coach.;    "Hopefully, some time this year I'll be able to help
Dad.";    And all the advice Dad gave to son wasn't forgotten.;    "I was
amused when <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> would reiterate something to the kids that would be exactly
the same thing I told him.";    Sounds like good advice.  </TEXT>

As the <DATE>summer</DATE> baseball and softball seasons wind down, several Glendale-area 
all-star teams are contending for titles. 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>La Crescenta Babe Ruth</ORGANIZATION> all-stars, made up of 13-year-olds, were scheduled 
to play <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> in the <LOCATION>Babe Ruth Western Regionals</LOCATION> at <LOCATION>Carson City</LOCATION>.

</P>
<P>
La Crescenta advanced to the third round by defeating <ORGANIZATION>Reno</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Nev.</LOCATION>, 7-4, and 
<LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>, 9-6. 
</P>
<P>
The winner of the regional advances to the <ORGANIZATION>Babe Ruth World Series</ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION>Jamestown</LOCATION>, 
<LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION> 
</P>
<P>
Entering this week, the <ORGANIZATION>Crescenta Valley Little League</ORGANIZATION> all-stars were still 
alive in the Division 2 tournament at <LOCATION>Long Beach</LOCATION>. The winner advances to the 
Western Regionals. 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>Crescenta Valley</LOCATION> defeated <LOCATION>West Arcadia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Laguna</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Woodland Hills</LOCATION> en route to 
<DATE>Tuesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>'s winners'-bracket showdown with <ORGANIZATION>Cypress</ORGANIZATION>. Results of that game 
were not available at press time. 
</P>
<P>
In softball, <PERSON>Nancy Evans</PERSON> had 18 strikeouts as the <ORGANIZATION>Centennial League</ORGANIZATION> all-stars 
defeated <LOCATION>Tucson</LOCATION> (Ariz.), 3-0, <DATE>Monday</DATE> in the opening round of the 13-15-year-old 
<ORGANIZATION>Senior Division Western Regional</ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION>Pinole</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Centennial, which finished second in the <DATE>1989</DATE> Senior World Series, will play 
<LOCATION>Red Bluff</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, <DATE>today</DATE> in a second-round game. 
</P>
<P>
In the 10-12-year-old <ORGANIZATION>Major Division</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Lindsay Parker</PERSON> struck out 13 and pitched 
her seventh consecutive no-hitter as the Liberty League all-stars defeated

</P>
<P>
Life in the fast lane: <PERSON>Tom Kendall</PERSON> of <LOCATION>La Canada</LOCATION> won his third consecutive

<TEXT>
<P>
The pitch was right where it had to be. Two more inches outside and it's Ball 
4. Six inches inside and <PERSON>Kirk Gibson</PERSON> fouls it off again. Pops it up. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, it was a pitch that made the <PERSON>Hall</PERSON> of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
It was no surprise to the batter. <PERSON>Gibson</PERSON> knew it was coming all the way. He 
wasn't really muscled up to hit it out of the park, just out of the infield. 
</P>
<P>
The circumstances were these: The World Series, it so happened, was on the 
line. Not everyone knew it at the time because it was only Game 1, but it was 
the ninth inning, and the Dodgers trailed, 4-3, with two out. 
</P>
<P>
No one knew history was in the making as <PERSON>Kirk Gibson</PERSON> limped up to the plate. No 
one knew a home run for the ages was about to be hit. Else, why did <PERSON>Mike Davis</PERSON>, 
who walked with two out, steal second base? I mean, would you steal second with 
Babe <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON> coming up? What if you get thrown out? There goes the World Series. 
There goes baseball history. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Gibson</PERSON> came out of the Dodger dugout like a guy who had just got hit by a 
truck. He didn't walk, he hobbled. 
</P>
<P>
History is not made, it just happens. You have to wonder, what if Charlie Root 
had walked Babe <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON> the day he called his shot in the World Series in <DATE>1932</DATE>? 
And what if <PERSON>Dennis Eckersley</PERSON> had bounced a 3-2 curve to <PERSON>Gibson</PERSON> in the World 
Series in <DATE>1988</DATE>? 
</P>
<P>
No one knows if <PERSON>Babe Ruth</PERSON> knew what was coming that day in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> so long ago. 
</P>
<P>
But <PERSON>Kirk Gibson</PERSON> knew exactly what was coming in Game 1 in <DATE>1988</DATE>. Because in the 
pre-Series scouting session with the club, scout <PERSON>Mel Didier</PERSON> laid it on the 
line. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure as I'm standing here breathing, if it's the ninth inning and the count is 
3-2, you're going to see a back-door slider from <PERSON>Dennis Eckersley</PERSON>," he warned. 
"Make book on it. Don't look for anything else." 
</P>
<P>
A back-door slider is a cross between a fastball and a curveball. It looks like 
a fastball till it swerves like a breaking ball. It's a home run pitch. It's a 
batting practice pitch -- if you know it's coming. Otherwise, it's called 
Strike 3. 
</P>
<P>
That's what it would have been in <PERSON>Gibson</PERSON>'s case. The back-door nomenclature 
comes from the fact that the pitch is delivered to the outside of the plate to 
a left-handed batter. It looks all the way like Ball 4. Only <PERSON>Gibson</PERSON> knew that 
at the last fraction, the ball would dip over the plate and down into the 
strike zone. He put that pitch into the right-field seats -- and, no doubt, 
into <LOCATION>Cooperstown</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Only a few home runs make the <ORGANIZATION>Hall of Fame</ORGANIZATION>. Ruth's called shot in <DATE>'32</DATE>. <PERSON>Bobby 
Thomson</PERSON>'s three-run "little miracle of <PERSON>Coogan</PERSON>'s Bluff" in the ninth in <DATE>1951</DATE>. 
<PERSON>Henry Aaron</PERSON>'s 715th. 
</P>
<P>
And <PERSON>Kirk Gibson</PERSON>'s in Dodger Stadium in <DATE>1988</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Because that home run effectively won the World Series. It's not impossible to 
think that the <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION> Athletics suddenly began to look like a lot of guys 
trapped in a haunted house after that one swing. 
</P>
<P>
Before that, they had given all the appearances of being an almost 
overconfident bunch. They had just slammed down the dangerous <ORGANIZATION>Boston Red Sox</ORGANIZATION> in 
four straight. The Dodgers weren't even supposed to be in the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Jose Canseco</PERSON> had done what he's supposed to do in the World Series -- hit a 
grand slam. The A's had the best relief pitcher in the universe on the mound. 
They had a guy at bat who looked as if he'd just left his wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
And, all of a sudden, the ball is in the right-field seats. The game is over. 
Oakland is hearing voices. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Gibson</PERSON>'s home run is one for the ages. But it wouldn't have been had <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION> 
come back to sweep the Series. It would have been just an interesting incident. 
Now, it becomes one of the great dramatic turning points of baseball history. 
</P>
<P>
It was a home run the minute it left the bat. The only suspense was how far up 
in the bleachers it would land. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Gibson</PERSON> recalls that he wasn't able to put the real <PERSON>Gibson</PERSON> 360-degree home run 
swing on it. He didn't have to. If he had been able to, the ball might not have 
come down yet. As it was, it was no foul-line shot. It was a rainmaker. 
</P>
<P>
Gibson never got another at-bat in the Series. He didn't need one. Gibson 
batted 1.000 for the '88 World Series. In fact, he batted a million. It's 
probably what that hit was worth to the <ORGANIZATION>Dodgers</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Kirk Gibson</PERSON> has now hit seven home runs in postseason play. If <PERSON>Reggie Jackson</PERSON> 
is <PERSON>Mr. October</PERSON>, <PERSON>Kirk Gibson</PERSON> is at least hey-what-about-me? 
</P>
<P>
He hit two home runs in one game in the <DATE>1984</DATE> World Series. The second one put 
that Series away. 
</P>
<P>
"There were men on second and third, first base was open and the expectation 
was that (<LOCATION>San Diego Padres</LOCATION> relief pitcher) <PERSON>Goose Gossage</PERSON> would walk me," he 
recalls. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember (Manager) <PERSON>Sparky Anderson</PERSON> was holding up four fingers to me, 
indicating they were going to walk me. I shook my head. I knew <PERSON>Gossage</PERSON> would 
try to strike me out. I held up 10 fingers and shook them at <LOCATION>Sparky</LOCATION>, meaning I 
bet <MONEY>10 dollars</MONEY> Gossage would pitch to me. Sparky said, 'You got a bet!' 
</P>
<P>
"(<LOCATION>San Diego Manager</LOCATION>) <PERSON>Dick Williams</PERSON> came out to the mound. I could almost hear 
<PERSON>Gossage</PERSON> mouthing to him, 'Hey! I've always had pretty good luck pitching to 
this guy. Let me get him out. I can strike him out.' 
</P>
<P>
"The first pitch was a ball. The second was what I knew it would be. A <PERSON>Gossage</PERSON> 
fastball up and in." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Kirk Gibson</PERSON> hit it into the second deck. That World Series was over, too. 
</P>
<P>
The moral of the story is, never throw <PERSON>Kirk Gibson</PERSON> a strike with a game, or a 
Series on the line. Particularly if he's expecting it. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, these are the little mistakes that make baseball what it is, 
endlessly fascinating to rehash, relive. The game that brought the hot stove 
league to sports. 
</P>
<P>
To err is not only human, it's baseball. Pitchers get E-1 if they throw wildly 
or to a wrong base. They should get one for throwing accurately to the plate 
with <PERSON>Gibson</PERSON> and a Series on the line. But of such foibles is the game made 
great. 
</P>
<P>
What if <PERSON>Charlie Root</PERSON> had hit Babe <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON> in the fat of the back instead of the 
fat of the bat? Suppose <PERSON>Ralph Branca</PERSON> had thrown <PERSON>Bobby Thomson</PERSON> a changeup? What 
if <PERSON>Dennis Eckersley</PERSON> had thrown a back-door Ball 4 that never broke over the 
plate, instead of a slider that did? 
</P>
<P>
If he had, the 500,000 or so people who say they saw <PERSON>Gibson</PERSON>'s home run from the 
seats would admit they missed the game altogether. Instead of being a home run 
for <LOCATION>Cooperstown</LOCATION>, it would have been, if <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION> had gone on to win the Series, 
just another run batted in. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Gibson</PERSON> has the ball. He ought at least write, "Thanks, <PERSON>Mel</PERSON>!" on it for <PERSON>Didier</PERSON>. 
And for all baseball. 
</P>

RUTH BROUGHT BASEBALL ROARING INTO THE '20S 
</P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Seventy years ago <DATE>today</DATE>, a first-year outfielder for the <ORGANIZATION>New York Yankees</ORGANIZATION> hit 
his 30th and 31st home runs of the <DATE>1920</DATE> season in the second game of a 
doubleheader at the <ORGANIZATION>Polo Grounds</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
So what? 
</P>
<P>
So, <PERSON>George Herman</PERSON> (Babe) <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON> became the first to hit 30 home runs in a season. 
In the next several weeks, he would also become the first to hit 40 and 50 home 
runs, too. 
</P>
<P>
He was on his way to a home run record that, in <DATE>1920</DATE>, was almost beyond belief 
-- he would hit 54, then 59 in <DATE>1921</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Reference points: When <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON> hit 54 in <DATE>1920</DATE>, the second-highest total in 
baseball that year was 19, by <PERSON>George Sisler</PERSON>. Only one other team in the 
American League that year hit more than 44 home runs. 
</P>
<P>
When he hit his 30th homer that afternoon, it was the 138th of <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON>'s career, 
making him, at 25, the all-time home run leader. Many baseball historians claim 
today that <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON>'s <DATE>1920</DATE> and '21 seasons were the greatest consecutive seasons by 
any hitter in baseball history. And many even believe either season was 
superior to his more famous <DATE>1927</DATE> season. 
</P>
<P>
Ruth played in only 142 games in <DATE>1920</DATE>, yet drove in 137 runs. His home run 
percentage that season was <PERCENT>11.8%</PERCENT>, compared to <DATE>1927</DATE>, when it was <PERCENT>11.1%</PERCENT> as he hit 
60 in 151 games. 
</P>
<P>
But most impressive of all, <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON>'s slugging percentages in <DATE>1920</DATE> and '21 were 
.847 and .846. Neither figure has ever been approached. In fact, a slugging 
percentage higher than .704 has been achieved only 20 times, eight by <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
Ruth has the three highest slugging percentages ever. His .772 mark for <DATE>1927</DATE> is 
No. 3. No. 4 is <PERSON>Lou Gehrig</PERSON>'s .765 in <DATE>1927</DATE>. Ruth and <PERSON>Gehrig</PERSON> are on the top-20 
list 11 times. The most recent player to make the top 20 was <PERSON>Ted Williams</PERSON>, who 
hit .731 in <DATE>1957</DATE> to rank 12th. 
</P>
<P>
Ruth joined the <ORGANIZATION>Yankees</ORGANIZATION> after the <DATE>1919</DATE> season, when <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> sold him to <LOCATION>New 
York</LOCATION>. In his last <ORGANIZATION>Red Sox</ORGANIZATION> season, playing in 130 games, <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON> was 9-5 as a 
pitcher, and hit 29 home runs -- then a record -- and drove in 114 runs as an 
outfielder. 
</P>
<P>
Before <DATE>1920</DATE>, no 20th-Century player had ever hit 30, 40 or 50 homers in a 
season. Only three had ever hit 20, and one was Ruth. Three late-19th Century 
players hit between 20 and 27 home runs, but some of those, it is believed, 
were inside-the-park homers, many coming in fenceless ballparks. 
</P>
<P>
So in <DATE>1920</DATE>, no one had ever seen this kind of home run production. As recently 
as <DATE>1918</DATE>, <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON> co-led the major leagues with 11 home runs. 
</P>
<P>
And people paid plenty to see home runs in bunches. The Yankees, who after two 
more seasons would be able to afford to build a new ballpark -- Yankee Stadium, 
a.k.a. "The House that Ruth Built" -- became the first team to draw 1 million 
fans in a season, in <DATE>1920</DATE>. They drew 1,289,422, breaking the previous 
attendance mark by 380,000.

   Babe <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON> drank here, between innings. <PERSON>Bill Veeck</PERSON>
threw his wooden leg across a stool and rhapsodized here for hours.
And future baseball legends, it now appears, will get a chance to
become part of the lore at <ORGANIZATION>McCuddy</ORGANIZATION>'s saloon.
   The tavern is one of 11 businesses scheduled for demolition as
the state clears the area around ancient Comiskey Park for a new
stadium for <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>White Sox</ORGANIZATION> by <DATE>1991</DATE>.
   But Gov. <PERSON>James R. Thompson</PERSON> has promised that <PERSON>McCuddy</PERSON>'s, with a
little help from the state, will rise from those ashes like a
phoenix in the same spot it has occupied for 78 years _ directly
across the street from <LOCATION>Comiskey Park</LOCATION>.
   ``I'm ecstatic,'' <PERSON>Pat Senese</PERSON>, the bar's 65-year-old owner, said
<DATE>Monday</DATE>. ``My wife is the third generation of the <PERSON>McCuddy</PERSON> family to
have a stake in this and now we know it'll go on beyond that.
   ``It'll be sad to see the building come down, and besides, we'll
be closed for two years'' during stadium construction, <PERSON>Senese</PERSON> said.
   ``But they tell me it's sitting where the third-base line of the
new one (stadium) will be.
   ``And opening again in two years is better than not opening at
all.''
   The interior of <ORGANIZATION>McCuddy</ORGANIZATION>'s will be all that survives the move.
<PERSON>Thompson</PERSON> said he wanted to save the exterior, but noted there is no
way to build the new stadium and parking lots and still accommodate
<PERSON>McCuddy</PERSON>'s during the two-year construction.
   ``It'll have the same feel even if the exterior is new and even
if we're sitting on state-leased land,'' said <PERSON>Senese</PERSON>, who sold his
old parcel of land _ the bar, an adjoining home and two lots _ to
the state for about <MONEY>$235,000</MONEY>.
   ``We'll be across from the park and we'll put a few cracks in
the floor and walls if we have to.''
   McCuddy's has been a <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> institution since <PERSON>John J. McCuddy</PERSON>
got a tip from a rich and powerful friend named <PERSON>Charles Comiskey</PERSON>.
   Known as the ``Old Roman,'' Comiskey owned <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>American
League</ORGANIZATION> franchise at the <DATE>turn of the century</DATE>, and long harbored
dreams of one day moving from the old wooden ballyard at 39th
Street that was the club's home.
   <PERSON>John J. McCuddy</PERSON> was one of the few people <ORGANIZATION>Comiskey</ORGANIZATION> let in on the
dream, and <PERSON>McCuddy</PERSON>'s opened its doors in time to serve the
construction workers who built Comiskey Park _ dubbed the
``Baseball Palace of the World'' when it opened <DATE>July 1, 1910</DATE>.
   ``We've been open for every home game ever since,'' said <PERSON>Senese</PERSON>.
   ``In fact, that's the only time we are open. They have rock
concerts here, soccer games, whatever _ our doors are shut.
   ``This is a baseball joint _ always has been, always will be.''
   So much so that <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON>, legend has it, came across the street
between innings of <ORGANIZATION>Yankees-White Sox</ORGANIZATION> contests during the mid-1920s
and tipped a few beers before making his way, tipsy sometimes, back
to right field.
   The Babe's visits to McCuddy's would have come right in the
middle of the <ORGANIZATION>Prohibition Era</ORGANIZATION>, which began in <DATE>1920</DATE> and lasted until
<DATE>1933</DATE>, when <PERSON>Elizabeth</PERSON> ``Toots'' <PERSON>McCuddy</PERSON> headed the family and ran
the tavern.
   But that didn't mean Babe would have had a problem getting a
beer, said <PERSON>Pudi McCuddy</PERSON>, <PERSON>Senese</PERSON>'s wife and <PERSON>Elizabeth McCuddy</PERSON>'s
daughter.
   ``I know <PERSON>McCuddy</PERSON>'s used to serve what they called near beer (a
legal, weaker version of beer) in those days,'' said <PERSON>McCuddy</PERSON>, who
still has the photograph depicting <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON> holding her when she was a
young girl.
   ``But it's also possible the real stuff was available for
special customers as well. Knowing Toots, that would be my guess.
   ``Unfortunately, the only person who would know for sure is my
aunt Frances,'' she added, ``and she died two years ago.''
   ``He was the only guy ever allowed into the place wearing
spikes,'' said <PERSON>Senese</PERSON>. ``He ate everything he could eat and drink
in about three minutes is how my wife tells it. Of course, she was
a little girl then, so we're relying on second-hand information.''
   Yet the day after the White Sox' final home contest this season
_ originally thought to be <PERSON>McCuddy</PERSON>'s last stand _ <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON>'s daughter
called up <PERSON>Senese</PERSON> and said she wanted to see the place so lovingly
described by the Babe.
   ``People get emotional about this place. <ORGANIZATION>Bil Veeck</ORGANIZATION>, when he
owned the club, always found time to come in for a beer and he'd
end up sitting for hours. Always had time and a few good stories
for the fans,'' <PERSON>Senese</PERSON> said.
   ``In fact, we've had women bring their infants in and fill up a
thimble with beer _ just so they can say that the little one had
his first one at McCuddy's.''

<LEADPARA>  JOHN Goodman's "Babe" will not lionize the baseball legend.;   "Babe Ruth had
a lot of problems, a lot of vices. It's a dark movie -- with warts and all
kinds of things," reveals Bruce Boxleitner, who plays Ruth's wisecracking best
friend, Joe Dugan, in the upcoming feature. He feels the approach of the
biopic "might even make some people angry."  </LEADPARA>

<MEMO>  The Grapevine  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     The recent "Babe Ruth Story" TV movie did touch upon the late Sultan of
Swat's drinking and womanizing, but could only go so far as a network
television offering. "Babe," however, "doesn't stop," <PERSON>Boxleitner</PERSON> says, and
when it comes to the slugger's parade of women, "it doesn't hold back. . . .
<PERSON>Ruth</PERSON> was the most famous athlete of his day, and as far as female admirers,
the situation for athletes then and now wasn't that different.";   <PERSON>Boxleitner</PERSON>
did additional "Babe" shooting earlier this month -- after he completed <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION>'s
upcoming "The Secret" TV movie, in which he plays the son of <PERSON>Kirk Douglas</PERSON>'
character.;   HELLO AGAIN: <PERSON>Jack Klugman</PERSON> is returning to the tube -- in a
two-hour presentation of "Quincy" for <ORGANIZATION>Universal</ORGANIZATION>. It's been a long road back
for the beloved actor, who lost a vocal cord during cancer surgery in <DATE>1989</DATE>.
However, he's feeling and sounding fine -- and expects to have another TV
project firmed soon.;   BOW-WOW: <PERSON>Ivan Reitman</PERSON>'s "Beethoven" comedy, in which a
dog serves as the title character, is set for an Easter release. It sounds
like it'll be well worth the wait from what we're told by some who've seen
early sneaks of the picture -- and from "Beethoven" star <PERSON>Charles Grodin</PERSON>. He
reports the movie "has elements of what '<ORGANIZATION>Lassie Come Home</ORGANIZATION>' had -- a dog in
jeopardy." He adds it wasn't only the dog that made "Beethoven" a challenge,
but also working with a child, 6-year-old <PERSON>Sara Rose Karr</PERSON>. "You'd be in the
middle of a scene and suddenly she'd be telling you about her new jacket. I'd
look up at <PERSON>Ivan</PERSON> and he'd smile like, 'That's just the way it is.' After making
'Kindergarten Cop,' he's an old hand at working with kids," says <PERSON>Grodin</PERSON>, who
adds, "I'm not complaining. She's adorable.";   MOVING ALONG: Singer/actress
<PERSON>Carrie Hamilton</PERSON> reveals that since the mother-daughter book she was supposed
to do with mom <PERSON>Carol Burnett</PERSON> fell through, she's been approached by several
publishers about doing her tale solo. She's rejecting such a notion. "They
keep asking if I want to carry on and write the book on my own," says
<PERSON>Hamilton</PERSON>, who went through years of a harrowing teen-age drug addiction. "I
just celebrated 10 years sober, but I'm not Gandhi. I'm still just sort of
living life and stumbling through like everyone else." And besides, she adds,
"Back then (<DATE>1987</DATE>), the whole idea of a dysfunctional family was relatively
new. Now there's been so many 'I was a bad girl' books. I'm just going to
leave it shelved.";   HUMAN KIND: It'll be a different -- "more human" --
<PERSON>Steven Seagal</PERSON> on the big screen next year when his "Dreadnought" film goes
into release.;   That's the word from writer <PERSON>Jonathan Lawton</PERSON>, who reports, "We
are trying to make him more mainstream . . . getting him out of the pure
action genre and into an acting role." Among other things, he says, the macho
star will be shown shooting a gun and missing -- and getting punched, knocked
down "and not hitting the guy back or killing him or anything.";   The
29-year-old, best-known for writing "Pretty Woman," is feverishly finishing a
rewrite of the "Dreadnought" script -- for which he received <MONEY>$1 million</MONEY> up
front with <MONEY>$300,000</MONEY> more to come. "I'm trying to bring the budget within a
reasonable range. The original script was almost irresponsible, with things
like battleships getting blown up," admits <PERSON>Lawton</PERSON> -- who is also busy trying
to launch the offbeat new "Pizza Man" comedy he wrote and directed (under his
sometimes-pseudonym J.D. <LOCATION>Athens</LOCATION>).;   "The way it was, 'Dreadnought' would have
cost <MONEY>$100 million-plus</MONEY> to make. Now we're looking at the <MONEY>$30 million</MONEY> range,"
he says.;   The feature was initially planned for a <DATE>December</DATE> production start,
but now <PERSON>Seagal</PERSON> hopes to start the picture in <DATE>January</DATE>, according to <LOCATION>Lawton</LOCATION>.
Second-unit filming has already begun in <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>. "It was <PERSON>Steven</PERSON>'s idea to fit
the <LOCATION>Pearl Harbor</LOCATION> Memorial into the film," says <PERSON>Lawton</PERSON>, "because all these
incredible ships would be there -- a spectacular sight."  </TEXT>

LIZ SMITH: GORDY TELLS HIS VERSION OF SUPREMES' BREAKUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LIZ SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAST WEEK we told you about an upcoming book titled "All That Glittered: My 
Life With The Supremes" written by the late <PERSON>Florence Ballard</PERSON>'s friend and fan, 
<PERSON>Tony Turner</PERSON>. This behind the scenes tell-all didn't have many nice things to 
say about <PERSON>Diana Ross</PERSON> and <PERSON>Berry Gordy Jr.</PERSON> and about <ORGANIZATION>Motown</ORGANIZATION>'s efforts to control 
or silence the volatile and bitter <PERSON>Ballard</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
Now <PERSON>Gordy</PERSON> has given his first in-depth interview in 20 years to Rolling Stone, 
an issue due on newsstands <DATE>Aug. 7</DATE>. And in light of this latest bashing that he 
and <PERSON>Ross</PERSON> are about to endure, what <PERSON>Gordy</PERSON> has to say to <PERSON>Michael Goldberg</PERSON> about 
the breakup of the Supremes is very interesting indeed: 
</P>
<P>
"It had gotten to the point, as it does in so many groups, when there's a total 
miscommunication between the two factions. The ones in the background were 
having conflicts with the one in front. Diana never wanted to leave the girls, 
particularly. She was more or less pushed out, but that's what happens when a 
person is out front, and people are telling the background singers that she's 
stealing the show. . . . I made the choice who sang lead, and my opinion was 
always that <PERSON>Diana</PERSON> had the magic and <PERSON>Mary Wilson</PERSON> didn't. But <PERSON>Mary</PERSON> felt she 
should be the one, and I said no and favoritism was charged. And it was perhaps 
favoritism because <PERSON>Diana</PERSON> was a favorite of mine." 
</P>
<P>
It must be noted that <PERSON>Berry</PERSON> does not mention <PERSON>Ballard</PERSON> in his overview of the 
rise and fall of The Supremes. Perhaps that is just as well. They parted as 
enemies and Flo was never able to reconcile herself to the fact of <PERSON>Diana Ross</PERSON>'s 
charisma, and that it was <PERSON>Ross</PERSON>'s appeal that propelled the group to 
super-stardom. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>JOHN GOODMAN</PERSON> is possibly the busiest and most popular actor around right now. 
He's currently exterminating spiders in "Arachnophobia," just finished up 
<ORGANIZATION>Universal</ORGANIZATION>'s "King Ralph I" in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> and will soon return to the set of <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION>'s 
hit series "Roseanne" (that is, if his co-star <PERSON>Roseanne Barr</PERSON>, doesn't 
completely self-destruct). 
</P>
<P>
Now comes word that it will be <PERSON>John Goodman</PERSON> in an upcoming big-screen movie 
about the life of baseball legend <LOCATION>Babe Ruth</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Film and sports buffs may recall it won't be the first time Ruth's life has 
been given the Hollywood treatment. In <DATE>1948</DATE> <PERSON>William Bendix</PERSON> portrayed baseball's 
great star in "The Babe Ruth Story." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>KEVIN COSTNER</PERSON> is putting the final touches on his "Dances With The Wolves" 
epic, a film which he produced, directed and stars in. While doing this, and 
preparing for his <PERSON>Robin Hood</PERSON> role in "Prince of Thieves," he is mulling over an 
offer from <ORGANIZATION>Orion</ORGANIZATION> for a sequel to his big hit "Bull Durham."

<HEAD>Goodbye McCuddy's, The House Where Ruth Drank</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDSEY TANNER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   McCuddy's Tavern was built 79 years ago, just in
time to cool the throats of construction workers who were building
a baseball palace for <ORGANIZATION>Charles Comiskey's Chicago White Sox</ORGANIZATION>.
   On <DATE>Monday</DATE>, the scene was reversed: The bar was destroyed to make
room for a new ballpark.
   It was a tearful occasion for <PERSON>Jack Blachley</PERSON>, 12, who once sold
hot dogs at McCuddy's, a baseball landmark and one of <LOCATION>Babe Ruth</LOCATION>'s
favorite hangouts when he came to play the <ORGANIZATION>White Sox</ORGANIZATION>.
   As the great-great grandson of the tavern's founder pulled the
lever and about 40 <PERSON>McCuddy</PERSON> family members watched somberly,
<ORGANIZATION>Speedway Wrecking Co.</ORGANIZATION> took the first big chunk out of the small
historic saloon that stood across the street from <LOCATION>Comiskey Park</LOCATION>.
   Young <PERSON>Jack</PERSON> was too choked up to talk about it at first and hid
his face as he said of the demolition, ``It's stupid.''
   But he later mustered up enough mischievousness to grab a piece
of rubble and shatter the front window, minutes before wreckers
made their final assault on the white, brick building.
   The demolition of <PERSON>McCuddy</PERSON>'s was like a funeral, family members
said, but in two years the tavern will be resurrected a block away,
right next to the new <LOCATION>Comiskey Park</LOCATION>.
   Artifacts from the tavern, including the mahogany bar and
``hundreds of priceless photos from the inception of the team,''
have all been placed in storage and will be used to duplicate the
old tavern's interior in the new bar, <PERSON>Mrs. Blachley</PERSON> said.
   ``I feel very empty,'' said <PERSON>Puddy McCuddy Senese</PERSON>, <PERSON>Jack</PERSON>'s
grandmother and grandaughter of <PERSON>John J. McCuddy</PERSON>, who opened the
tavern in <DATE>1910</DATE>. Workers who built the ballpark that year used to
down a few beers on breaks.
   ``It's a very hard thing, it hurts,'' said <PERSON>Mrs. Senese</PERSON>, the
tavern's current owner, as she watched history turn into rubble.
   When the late <PERSON>Bill Veeck</PERSON> owned the White Sox, he used to toss
his wooden leg over a stool at <ORGANIZATION>McCuddy</ORGANIZATION>'s and shoot the bull for
hours.
   When the Yankees were in town in the <DATE>1920s</DATE> and <DATE>'30s</DATE>, <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON> would
guzzle a few drinks at the tavern.
   When the <PERSON>McCuddy</PERSON> family home was next door, the Sultan of Swat
``would come over and have dinner with my great-grandmother,'' said
<PERSON>Sheri Blachley</PERSON>, <PERSON>Mrs. Senese</PERSON>'s daughter.
   Roast beef and homemade bread were Babe's favorite meals, said
<PERSON>Mrs. Senese</PERSON>. Both women declined to reveal their ages.
   The family home, where both women grew up, was knocked down
along with many other homes as the state cleared the way for
construction of the new ballpark, which will sit on top of the old
tavern site.
   ``I didn't want to come'' to watch the demolition, <PERSON>Mrs. Blachley</PERSON>
said. ``My mother asked me to. She put it this way: `It's only
going to happen once.'''

HIS DREAM ENDING TURNED INTO A NIGHTMARE; 
</P>
<P>
PREP BASEBALL: CULVER CITY PITCHER ESTAVIL HAD A ROUGH TIME IN FIRST-ROUND 
PLAYOFF GAME AGAINST THOUSAND OAKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY RIPTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
<PERSON>Mauricio Estavil</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Culver City</LOCATION> would have liked to have made a more graceful 
exit from prep baseball than the one he had to endure last week. 
</P>
<P>
The Centaurs' star left-handed pitcher and outfielder would have preferred 
ending his high school career at <LOCATION>Anaheim Stadium</LOCATION> in the CIF-Southern Section 
5-A Division championship game. 
</P>
<P>
He would have liked to have thrown a no-hit game in the 5-A final and brought 
his third-seeded team a Southern Section title. 
</P>
<P>
But that was not to be. 
</P>
<P>
In a first-round playoff game at <LOCATION>Culver City High</LOCATION> on <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, <LOCATION>Thousand Oaks</LOCATION>, 
the third-place team in the <ORGANIZATION>Marmonte League</ORGANIZATION>, treated Estavil like an ordinary 
pitcher. Worse than that, the Lancers gave him the bum's rush, routing the 
Centaurs, 10-1, and ousting them from the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Estavil, who had an 8-0 record in <ORGANIZATION>Ocean League</ORGANIZATION> play as <LOCATION>Culver</LOCATION> won the league 
championship, had the worst day of his prep pitching career. 
</P>
<P>
During the season, he had pitched a no-hitter, two one-hitters, three 
two-hitters and a three-hitter. But his outing against Thousand Oaks was more 
notable for the three batters he hit, for the five bases on balls he issued, 
for the nine runs he gave up -- five of them earned -- in 4 2/3 innings than 
for the five hits he surrendered to the Lancers. 
</P>
<P>
"It was not a very good time to have a bad day," <PERSON>Estavil</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
He had no excuses for his performance. "I knew they were a good-hitting team, 
but I wasn't nervous. It just wasn't there. 
</P>
<P>
"My fastball and curve ball weren't there. I tried to finesse, but that didn't 
work. I knew I didn't have my fastball, and I tried to mix it up with my curve 
-- but I wasn't getting that over either." 
</P>
<P>
Both pitches worked well for him for most of the season and <DATE>last year</DATE>, when he 
was a part-time pitcher who was more noted for being a hard-hitting right 
fielder. But even pitching only once in a while last year, he tossed a 
no-hitter and struck out 17 batters in another game. 
</P>
<P>
In his four years on the Culver varsity, he hit and pitched well enough to 
attract attention of college and major league scouts, well enough to earn a 
scholarship to <ORGANIZATION>Pepperdine University</ORGANIZATION>, where he plans to enroll next <DATE>fall</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Against Thousand Oaks, he had a day "like all good left-handers do at some time 
in their lives," said <PERSON>Art Harris</PERSON>, who scouts for the <ORGANIZATION>Dodgers</ORGANIZATION> and was the coach 
of strong baseball programs at <ORGANIZATION>West Los Angeles College</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Venice High</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Harris</PERSON> said that he has seen enough of Estavil on good days to realize that his 
poor performance last week was an aberration. "A good left-handed pitcher at 
the high school level can be overwhelming, and he has been overwhelming. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember him on one gray afternoon when the hitters weren't even flinching 
but were just standing there, trying to react. He throws the ball very well." 
</P>
<P>
He hits and plays the outfield the same way and will probably be used both as a 
pitcher and outfielder at <LOCATION>Pepperdine</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Bill Springman</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Pepperdine</ORGANIZATION>'s top 
assistant who does much of the recruiting for the Waves, said he feels that 
<PERSON>Estavil</PERSON>, a 6-foot, 175-pounder who bats from the left side, "will help us out 
pitching . . . and at the plate," either as a designated hitter or as an 
outfielder. 
</P>
<P>
As a pitcher, <PERSON>Springman</PERSON> said, <PERSON>Estavil</PERSON> "has a fastball, curve and change, and he 
throws them all for strikes. He keeps hitters off balance and is a very, very 
good competitor." 
</P>
<P>
Estavil said that in both <ORGANIZATION>Little League</ORGANIZATION> and Babe <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON> youth baseball he was "a 
pitcher most of the time, but in high school I concentrated on hitting." He 
said that other colleges were interested in his hitting but that <ORGANIZATION>Pepperdine</ORGANIZATION> 
also wanted him as a pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
He said that he doesn't know yet whether his hitting or pitching will take him 
farther if he should get the chance to play major league baseball. And he is 
likely to get the chance, if not in this <DATE>June</DATE>'s major league draft, then after 
his junior year at <LOCATION>Pepperdine</LOCATION> -- the soonest he can be drafted if he continues 
to play college ball. 
</P>
<P>
Harris thinks that <PERSON>Estavil</PERSON> has the potential to play in the major leagues but 
that he will benefit from playing in college. "He's the kind of kid who 
certainly will be followed closely when he gets to <LOCATION>Pepperdine</LOCATION>, and, within the 
normal progression, he should be considered a professional prospect. 
</P>
<P>
"One, he can hit. Two, he can throw. Immediately, that's two pluses." In three 
years at <LOCATION>Pepperdine</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Harris</PERSON> said, "he should fill out and is going to get 
stronger. If he shows some signs of hitting for power, that's another plus." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Harris</PERSON> said that he thinks Estavil might have a brighter future playing every 
day in the outfield, but that he does not rule out the possibility that the 
youngster could pitch in the major leagues -- if he gets someone to work with 
him on pitching and develops "a good off-speed pitch and (a better) breaking 
ball." 
</P>
<P>
Estavil's favorite players are Babe <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON> and <PERSON>Reggie Jackson</PERSON>, both known for 
their hitting, although <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON> was an excellent pitcher early in his career for 
the <ORGANIZATION>Boston Red Sox</ORGANIZATION> before he was sold to the <ORGANIZATION>New York Yankees</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, <PERSON>Estavil</PERSON> said that he "always considered myself as a hitter, 
but it depends how far my pitching goes. You never know." Estavil, like <PERSON>Harris</PERSON>, 
believes he needs more specialized coaching to develop as a pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
Estavil was born in <LOCATION>Madrid</LOCATION> after his family fled <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION> for <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>, and he and his 
family came to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> when he was about 2 years old. He said he has 
seen Ruth only in newsreels but that the baseball immortal made a deep 
impression on him. 
</P>
<P>
"He was left-handed, and I liked the way he played and swung the bat." 
</P>
<P>
He said that if he is drafted in <DATE>June</DATE>, he will accept an offer from a major 
league team only if he is picked in an early round and is offered good money. 
</P>
<P>
If he is a late-round draft choice, he said, "I'd go to college because I want 
the education to fall back on. Baseball is a long, hard pull." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Harris</PERSON> said that <PERSON>Estavil</PERSON> is a legitimate candidate for this year's draft but 
that the fact that he has "committed to Pepperdine might scare off some 
people." 
</P>
<P>
Estavil will probably spend the next three years pitching and hitting for 
Pepperdine because," he said, "I'll get a chance to play every day. But I also 
want to pitch because you have control of the game."

JIM MURRAY: TODAY, HE'D REALLY BE A PEACHY GUY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jim Murray 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Once upon a time, there was this ballplayer and he was one of the best ever to 
play the game. He played with great intensity and verve, not to say abandon, 
and he got more hits than anyone else who ever played the game. You might say 
he sort of symbolized it. 
</P>
<P>
And then one day, rumors began to spread about him. He, of all people, had been 
betting on games, the whispers went. He was mixed up in some very bad company. 
All baseball was aghast -- to say nothing of the rest of the country. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Pete Rose</PERSON>? Naw. Who said anything about <PERSON>Pete Rose</PERSON>? We're talking about <PERSON>Ty Cobb</PERSON> 
here. 
</P>
<P>
You heard me. Tyrus <PERSON>Raymond Cobb</PERSON>. The legend. The man who would do anything to 
beat you. 
</P>
<P>
The details are the least bit hazy. But that's because baseball wanted them 
that way. The word cover-up was not in use in those times. But that may have 
been what it was. 
</P>
<P>
It seems that the infamous <ORGANIZATION>Chicago Black Sox</ORGANIZATION>, thrown out of the grand old game 
for fixing the <DATE>1919</DATE> World Series, had come forward in <DATE>1927</DATE> to claim that, in 
<DATE>1917</DATE>, they were able to win a pennant because a collection had been taken up on 
the team to pay off key <LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION> players to lose two consecutive doubleheaders 
to <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> and insure the pennant for them. 
</P>
<P>
One of the key players? <PERSON>Ty Cobb</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the <ORGANIZATION>Black Sox</ORGANIZATION> ringleaders, <PERSON>Swede Risberg</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Chick Gandil</ORGANIZATION>, were to 
testify. Even <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Tris Speaker</ORGANIZATION> was brought under suspicion. But <PERSON>Eliot 
Asinof</PERSON>, in his book "Eight Men Out," reports that the commissioner of baseball, 
<PERSON>Judge Kenesaw Landis</PERSON>, dismissed the charges. Why? "Because he was not 
interested in matters that occurred before he came to power." 
</P>
<P>
Except that the <ORGANIZATION>Black Sox</ORGANIZATION> scandal, on which he made his reputation, occurred 
before he came to power. 
</P>
<P>
What is more likely is that the judge couldn't bear to land another hard blow 
to the national pastime. Baseball couldn't handle a "Say it ain't so, Ty." 
</P>
<P>
A violent man who roughed himself up with paranoia, <PERSON>Cobb</PERSON> always saw a world of 
enemies. Fueled by hate, he drove himself with a frenzy unmatched in the 
history of the game. He may have been the most-feared man ever to put on a 
baseball uniform. Teammates said there were days they were afraid to say hello 
to him. 
</P>
<P>
Al <LOCATION>Stump</LOCATION>, free-lance journalist, is perhaps the foremost authority on <ORGANIZATION>Cobb</ORGANIZATION>. He 
lived with him for several months of <ORGANIZATION>Cobb</ORGANIZATION>'s late life when he was preparing a 
biography on the dying star. 
</P>
<P>
"They're doing a story in the movies on <ORGANIZATION>Cobb</ORGANIZATION>," Stump writes. "I just signed a 
participation deal with <PERSON>Robert Greenwald</PERSON> Productions-MPI at <LOCATION>MGM</LOCATION>. Terrible Ty 
makes it to the silver screen. 
</P>

"Only there's this one big trouble: Who do you get to play the dyspeptic, 
villainous Tiger as hero of a drama depicting his life?

"Do you call Central Casting or the Screen Actors' Guild and say 'Who've you

<P>
Adds Stump: "You need a <PERSON>Boris Karloff</PERSON>, at least. Or <PERSON>Bela Lugosi</PERSON>. Face it -- who

</P>
<P>
"You want tough? In <DATE>1916</DATE>, he used a gun on a butcher and trashed his entire

</P>
<P>
"After spiking some stitches on the beloved Home <PERSON>Run Baker</PERSON>, he drew packets of

<P>
If there's one thing <PERSON>Mickey</PERSON> (Himself) <PERSON>Hatcher</PERSON> could always do, it was hit a 
baseball. Hard. Somewhere. Often. 
</P>
<P>
He isn't all that good throwing it, catching it. But give him a bat and he is a 
star. 
</P>
<P>
The other thing he can do is smile. If you walk into a locker room, the one 
with the big grin is <LOCATION>Mickey</LOCATION>. His attitude is infectious. One of the most dour 
creatures in the world is the ballplayer who has just gone zero for four or 
been knocked out of the box in the third inning. 
</P>
<P>
Mickey just lets it roll off his back. He has always managed to look as if he 
has just hit the game-winning home run. 
</P>
<P>
Last <DATE>October</DATE>, he did. Twice. 
</P>
<P>
The home run everyone remembers -- and always will remember -- from the <DATE>1988</DATE> 
season is the one <PERSON>Kirk Gibson</PERSON> hit with two out in the ninth inning of Game 1. 
It's one of the most famous home runs in baseball history. It won the game, 
maybe the Series. 
</P>
<P>
But <PERSON>Kirk Gibson</PERSON> might not even have been to bat if <PERSON>Mickey Hatcher</PERSON> hadn't hit a 
less famous but equally effective home run in the first inning of that game. 
The Dodgers would never have been in position to pull that game -- and series 
-- out of the fire in the ninth if <PERSON>Mickey Hatcher</PERSON> hadn't hit a two-run homer in 
the first. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Kirk Gibson</PERSON> is supposed to hit home runs. He was hitting his 28th home run of 
the season. <PERSON>Hatcher</PERSON> was hitting his second. 
</P>
<P>
In Game 5, <PERSON>Hatcher</PERSON> did it again -- walloping another two-run homer in the 
first. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't the first time a pitching staff had underestimated this <PERSON>Mick</PERSON> who 
wasn't <PERSON>Mantle</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
This <ORGANIZATION>Mickey</ORGANIZATION> manages to look in the batter's box like a little kid playing 
stickball in the streets. He stands in there with this lopsided grin, his 
stockings kind of sag. So does he. The cap is at a rakish angle. He looks a 
little bit like Bugs Bunny at the plate. All he needs is the carrot. 
</P>
<P>
When most people hit home runs, they go around the bases like a Pope. It's not 
even a trot, it's a procession. They stop and bow. Wave their caps. <PERSON>Jeffrey 
Leonard</PERSON> goes around the bases like Cleopatra's barge. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Mickey Hatcher</PERSON> goes around as if a posse is after him. He and <PERSON>Pete Rose</PERSON> hold 
the listed world records for circling the bases on home runs. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Hatcher</PERSON> is a throwback to the days when baseball was a game, not a business. He 
is actually a very considerable athlete -- he was a wide receiver for <PERSON>Barry 
Switzer</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>University of Oklahoma</ORGANIZATION> football team, for example. He has pretty good 
speed. He can hit anything that doesn't hit him first. Mickey doesn't require 
of a pitch that it be a strike. Just in the air, is all he wants. 
</P>
<P>
He is a born hitter. Every time you see in a record book where <PERSON>Mickey Hatcher</PERSON> 
has played in 100 games or more a season, you can make book he has hit .300 or 
close to it. If you throw the ball outside, he hits it into right field. If you 
throw it inside, as the <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION> Athletics pitchers found, he hits it in the 
seats. 
</P>
<P>
His problem has always been getting in a lineup. He came up with the <ORGANIZATION>Dodgers</ORGANIZATION> as 
a third baseman in the days when the team already had one -- <PERSON>Ron Cey</PERSON>. <PERSON>Hatcher</PERSON> 
batted .371, hit 10 homers and drove in 93 runs in his only real full season 
with the minor league <PERSON>Albuquerque Dukes</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
On the <ORGANIZATION>Dodgers</ORGANIZATION>, he just became <PERSON>Ron Cey</PERSON>'s caddie -- or <ORGANIZATION>Dusty Baker's</ORGANIZATION>. The guy 
who goes in for the late innings to give the regular a rest. He got in only 33 
games one year and 57 another. The year he played in 57, he got only 84 
at-bats. He wasn't even a utility man. He was an irregular. 
</P>
<P>
Mickey remained cheerful. Many another player would have tossed helmets, busted 
up lockers, roared, "Play me or trade me!" Mickey just filled in the time 
playing practical jokes. When someone put lampblack on <PERSON>Kirk Gibson</PERSON>'s cap last 
year, nobody on the club suspected the real culprit, <PERSON>Jesse Orosco</PERSON>. Everybody 
would have bet on <PERSON>Hatcher</PERSON> as the jokester. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Hatcher</PERSON> figures his horseplay is just a way of cutting tension. 
</P>
<P>
"I just try to keep everybody in a good frame of mind," he says. "When I see a 
guy who has just struck out sitting in a corner of the dugout all by himself, 
biting his lip, I just try to get him so he isn't down on himself. I mean, <PERSON>Babe 
Ruth</PERSON> struck out, right?" 
</P>
<P>
Babe <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON> might have struck out but <PERSON>Mickey Hatcher</PERSON> doesn't very often -- only 
seven times all last year. He usually strikes out only every other eclipse of 
the moon. 
</P>
<P>
So, why did he never become a star? 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Hatcher</PERSON> says it's because he always played too hard. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time I got a chance to play, I hit a wall," he recalls. 
</P>
<P>
He got carried out of <LOCATION>Fenway Park</LOCATION> on a stretcher once with what was feared to 
be a broken neck. He collided with the famous Green Monster while chasing a 
line drive in the corner. 
</P>
<P>
Another time, he got hit on the wrist with a pitch in mid-season -- and found 
out after the season was over that he played since then with a broken hand. 
</P>
<P>
He couldn't crack the Dodger lineup while <PERSON>Cey</PERSON> and <PERSON>Baker</PERSON> were in it and, when he 
got traded to <LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION>, he found <PERSON>Gary Gaetti</PERSON> in his way. Still, the only year 
in his major league career he got over 500 at-bats, he hit better than .300 -- 
.302, in fact -- drove in 69 runs and scored 61. 
</P>
<P>
"I put the bat on the ball," he admits. "I'm the kind of hitter the pitchers 
hate to see come up. I either have no weakness -- or I'm all weakness. They 
make a good pitch and I flare it somewhere for a double. They try to waste a 
pitch and I hit it off a wall. I drive them nuts." 
</P>
<P>
Most World Series heroes, when they star in a game, can tell you all about it 
-- not only how many were on base but who. Also, who was pitching, what he 
threw, the direction of the wind, time of day, relative humidity, where the 
pitch was, what the count was, what the temperature was and whether the infield 
was playing in or back. 
</P>
<P>
About all <PERSON>Mickey Hatcher</PERSON> can remember is who was President. 
</P>
<P>
He can't for the life of him remember the circumstances of the two homers and 
the five RBIs he had in the series. <PERSON>Hatcher</PERSON> has no memory for trivia. 
</P>
<P>
For the record, <PERSON>Mickey</PERSON>'s first Series home run was hit off <PERSON>Dave Stewart</PERSON>. The 
<LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION> pitcher had just hit leadoff batter <PERSON>Steve Sax</PERSON>, apparently in 
retaliation for Dodger pitcher <PERSON>Tim Belcher</PERSON> having hit the A's <PERSON>Jose Canseco</PERSON> in 
<LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION>'s half of the first inning. 
</P>
<P>
If so, <PERSON>Stewart</PERSON> hit the wrong batter. He should have saved the get-even pitch 
for <PERSON>Hatcher</PERSON>. Because <PERSON>Mickey Hatcher</PERSON> hit the first pitch into the left-field 
seats for a 2-0 <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> lead. 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>Dodgers</ORGANIZATION> hadn't put Mickey in the lineup for his bat but for his attitude. 
It happened after the first game in the playoff series against the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> 
Mets. The <ORGANIZATION>Dodgers</ORGANIZATION>, leading, 2-0, going into the ninth, had blown the lead and 
the game. The team was down. 
</P>
<P>
Manager <PERSON>Tommy Lasorda</PERSON> remembers looking over and seeing a crestfallen lot of 
ballplayers. All except <PERSON>Mickey Hatcher</PERSON>, who was going around with his hat on 
backward, making faces. 
</P>
<P>
The Mets didn't bother <PERSON>Mickey Hatcher</PERSON>. Nothing bothers <PERSON>Mickey Hatcher</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
World Series heroes come in all shapes and sizes. They're often as unlikely as 
<ORGANIZATION>Pepper Martin</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1931</DATE> or as predictable as <ORGANIZATION>Babe Ruth</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1927</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
But none ever took over a Series as a hitter any more thoroughly than <PERSON>Mickey</PERSON> 
(Himself) <PERSON>Hatcher</PERSON> and his two home runs and a double and four singles did in 
<DATE>1988</DATE>. He has a hard job remembering them but the rest of baseball will never 
forget them.

<HEAD>Advertisers Turn to Dead Celebrities For Sales Boost</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's said that dead men don't tell tales, but
advertisers are finding they do boost sales.
   The use of the deceased celebrities to hawk products is on the
rise, as any glance through a magazine or quick look at television
will attest.
   There's the late actor <PERSON>James Dean</PERSON> appearing in ads for sneakers,
baseball legend Babe <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON> selling electronics, <PERSON>Albert Einstein</PERSON>
pushing cameras. Other faces from the past are showing up in
advertisements for greeting cards, banks and computers.
   ``Everyone wants to associate their product with a winner or a
legend,'' said <PERSON>Beth Vahle</PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION>Curtis Management
Group of Indianapolis</ORGANIZATION>, which represents about 50 celebrities, living
and dead.
   After using Ruth a year ago for a limited advertising campaign,
<ORGANIZATION>Zenith Electronics Corp.</ORGANIZATION> reported that the promotion ``generated
thousands of sales leads.'' The ad featured <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON> at bat, with the
slogan: ``Sometimes A Major Player Can Change The Whole Game.''
   ``We were looking for a symbol of what our customers would
consider a major player,'' said <PERSON>John Taylor</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Zenith</ORGANIZATION> spokesman.
``Certainly, <PERSON>Babe Ruth</PERSON> was a major player and a real recognized
image.''
   Athletic shoe maker <ORGANIZATION>Converse Inc.</ORGANIZATION> decided to use Dean after the
company discovered a poster of Dean, shod in a pair of its <PERSON>Jack
Purcells</PERSON>, relaxing on the set of ``Giant.'' Converse negotiated with
the agency representing Dean's estate and the photographer who took
the picture to use it in advertising.
   <PERSON>Michael S. George</PERSON>, marketing manager for the <ORGANIZATION>Interco Inc.</ORGANIZATION>
subsidiary, would say only that the company paid ``thousands of
dollars'' to use the moody, black-and-white photo.
   It paid off. <PERSON>George</PERSON> said sales of the <PERSON>Jack Purcells</PERSON> model rose <PERCENT>30
percent</PERCENT> to <PERCENT>50 percent</PERCENT> in both <DATE>1987</DATE> and <DATE>1988</DATE>, ``and that's partially
attributable to the advertising.''
   ``The image projected in the photograph is very hip and
nostalgic,'' <PERSON>George</PERSON> said.
   The practice of using yesterday's celebrities to hawk today's
products ``has grown tremendously,'' said <PERSON>Roger Richman</PERSON>, president
of the <PERSON>Roger Richman</PERSON> Agency of <LOCATION>Beverly Hills</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, which
represents nearly 40 personalities.
   Richman's agency handles the licensing of <PERSON>Sigmund Freud</PERSON>, <LOCATION>W.C.</LOCATION>
Fields, <PERSON>Marilyn Monroe</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Einstein</LOCATION>.
   Richman would not discuss revenues, but he said his agency
receives about <PERCENT>35 percent</PERCENT> of the royalties generated by such ads.
   In addition to the popularity of the late greats, there are
practical advantages to advertisers using dead celebrities.
   Cost is one, since living personalities usually cost more to use
in an ad than an estate would charge, <PERSON>Mrs. Vahle</PERSON> said.
   Another benefit is concern about reputation. An advertiser using
a dead celebrity to pitch products doesn't have to worry about the
star tarnishing his name through a messy divorce or drug arrest, for
example.
   But at the same time the management agencies are promoting the
use of dead celebrities, they must spend time tracking down
unauthorized appearances from beyond the grave.
   Both <ORGANIZATION>Curtis Management</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Richman Agency</ORGANIZATION> have gone to court
seeking either to halt unauthorized use of an image or to demand
royalties for the families or estates involved.
   Heirs and representatives of celebrities say they should be paid
a royalty and have some control over how the departed are portrayed.
<PERSON>Mrs. Vahle</PERSON> and others argue that a persona should be considered
property that can be inherited.
   In <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>State Sen. Emanuel R. Gold</ORGANIZATION> proposed a bill that
would do just that by making the likeness of a dead person a
property right that can be inherited. The bill was killed last week,
however.
   Fewer than a dozen states have laws to protect the rights of dead
celebrities, and in other states judges have established some rights
through their decisions, said <PERSON>Mark Roesler</PERSON>, <PERSON>Curtis</PERSON>' president.

<TEXT>
<P>
<PERSON>Cecil Fielder</PERSON> became the first American Leaguer to hit 50 home runs since <PERSON>Roger 
Maris</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mickey Mantle</PERSON> did it 29 years ago, connecting <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> in the 
fourth inning and later adding No. 51 in the final game of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a lot of pressure," <PERSON>Fielder</PERSON> said. "I wouldn't wish that on anyone in 
baseball." 
</P>
<P>
The <LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION> first baseman is the 11th player to hit 50 homers and the first 
since <PERSON>George Foster</PERSON> of the <LOCATION>Cincinnati</LOCATION> Reds in <DATE>1977</DATE>. The feat has been 
accomplished 18 times. 
</P>
<P>
Fielder, who walked and lined out in his first two at-bats, sent a 2-and-1 
pitch from <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> Yankee rookie <PERSON>Steve Adkins</PERSON> into the first row of the upper 
deck in left field in the fourth. He took four steps out of the batter's box, 
watched to see if the ball would hook foul, and when it didn't, he began 
jumping up and down and pumping both fists into the air. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a relief," he said. "I got so excited, I jumped for joy." 
</P>
<P>
The two-run homer put <LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION> ahead, 6-0. After striking out, increasing his 
major league-leading total to 182, Fielder hit a three-run homer in the eighth 
off <PERSON>Alan Mills</PERSON> into the lower deck in left. 
</P>
<P>
Fielder led the majors in homers and with 132 RBIs this season. He had gone two 
for 21 since his last home run; his longest drought of the year without a homer 
was 45 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
Fielder went 0 for 4 in each of the first two games of the season-ending series 
at <ORGANIZATION>Yankee Stadium</ORGANIZATION>. He struck out five times, popped out twice and grounded to 
the mound. 
</P>
<P>
For the second consecutive game, <ORGANIZATION>Tiger</ORGANIZATION> Manager <PERSON>Sparky Anderson</PERSON> moved Fielder 
from the third spot in the lineup to second, hoping to get him an extra at-bat. 
</P>
<P>
Of the last five players to hit 50 home runs, four were named most valuable 
player. The only one who missed out was <PERSON>Mantle</PERSON>, who hit 54 homers to <PERSON>Maris</PERSON>' 
record 61 in <DATE>1961</DATE> in the home run race between Yankee teammates.

<TEXT>
<P>
<PERSON>Cecil Fielder</PERSON> became the first American Leaguer to hit 50 home runs since <PERSON>Roger 
Maris</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mickey Mantle</PERSON> did it 29 years ago, connecting <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> in the 
fourth inning and later adding No. 51 in the final game of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a lot of pressure," <PERSON>Fielder</PERSON> said. "I wouldn't wish that on anyone in 
baseball." 
</P>
<P>
The <LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION> first baseman is the 11th player to hit 50 homers and the first 
since <PERSON>George Foster</PERSON> of the <LOCATION>Cincinnati</LOCATION> Reds in <DATE>1977</DATE>. The feat has been 
accomplished 18 times. 
</P>
<P>
Fielder, who walked and lined out in his first two at-bats, sent a 2-and-1 
pitch from <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> Yankee rookie <PERSON>Steve Adkins</PERSON> into the first row of the upper 
deck in left field in the fourth. He took four steps out of the batter's box, 
watched to see if the ball would hook foul, and when it didn't, he began 
jumping up and down and pumping both fists into the air. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a relief," he said. "I got so excited, I jumped for joy." 
</P>
<P>
The two-run homer put <LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION> ahead, 6-0. After striking out, increasing his 
major league-leading total to 182, Fielder hit a three-run homer in the eighth 
off <PERSON>Alan Mills</PERSON> into the lower deck in left. 
</P>
<P>
Fielder led the majors in homers and with 132 RBIs this season. He had gone two 
for 21 since his last home run; his longest drought of the year without a homer 
was 45 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
Fielder went 0 for 4 in each of the first two games of the season-ending series 
at <ORGANIZATION>Yankee Stadium</ORGANIZATION>. He struck out five times, popped out twice and grounded to 
the mound. 
</P>
<P>
For the second consecutive game, <ORGANIZATION>Tiger</ORGANIZATION> Manager <PERSON>Sparky Anderson</PERSON> moved Fielder 
from the third spot in the lineup to second, hoping to get him an extra at-bat. 
</P>
<P>
Of the last five players to hit 50 home runs, four were named most valuable 
player. The only one who missed out was <PERSON>Mantle</PERSON>, who hit 54 homers to <PERSON>Maris</PERSON>' 
record 61 in <DATE>1961</DATE> in the home run race between Yankee teammates.

<LEADPARA>  The most famous asterisk in sports may disappear from the record books if a
baseball committee follows Commissioner Fay Vincent's recommendation to give
full respect to Roger Maris' 30-year-old home run record.;    Vincent wants to
drop Babe Ruth's 60 homers from the record books and give unqualified
recognition to Maris' 61.  </LEADPARA>

MARIS ALONE WOULD HOLD MARK  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     <PERSON>Vincent</PERSON> said <DATE>Thursday</DATE> that the eight-member committee for statistical
accuracy will meet in <DATE>September</DATE> to consider the issue. The panel, chaired by
<PERSON>Vincent</PERSON>, is composed of two other baseball officials, a statistician, two
sportswriters and two professors.;    "I'm inclined . . . to support the
single-record thesis, and that is <PERSON>Maris</PERSON> hit more home runs in a season than
anyone else," said <PERSON>Vincent</PERSON>, who was inspired by a <PERSON>Roger Angell</PERSON> article in <DATE>May
27</DATE>'s <LOCATION>New Yorker.</LOCATION>;    The issue was first decided by <ORGANIZATION>Commissioner Ford Frick</ORGANIZATION> on
<DATE>July 17, 1961</DATE>, when <PERSON>Maris</PERSON> had 35 homers and was three weeks ahead of <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON>'s
pace.;    <PERSON>Maris</PERSON> hit his 61st home run in the <ORGANIZATION>New York Yankees</ORGANIZATION>' final game of
the season. It was the first year of the expansion era, and the schedule had
been expanded to 162 games from 154, its length when <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON> hit 60 for the
Yankees in 1927.;    <ORGANIZATION>Frick</ORGANIZATION> died in <DATE>1978</DATE>, <PERSON>Maris</PERSON> in <DATE>1985.</DATE>;    For the record,
there is no actual asterisk. Therecord books list both marks -- with a
notation.  </TEXT>
