<HEAD>Shellfish Expected To Reach Rivers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A striped shellfish now clogging water system
pipelines and threatening the ecological balance of the <ORGANIZATION>Great Lakes</ORGANIZATION>
could make its way to rivers around the country in as little as
five years, scientists say.
   The rapidly producing zebra mussels could pose a significant
problem for manufacturing plants, many of which have miles of pipes
that draw cooling water, the experts warn.
   The mussels eventually will attach themselves to the insides of
pipes supplying factories and municipal water plants, in some cases
restricting flow, in the <LOCATION>Allegheny</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> and Monongahela rivers,
said <PERSON>Thomas Nalepa</PERSON>, a biologist with the <ORGANIZATION>National Oceanic</ORGANIZATION> and
<ORGANIZATION>Atmospheric Administration</ORGANIZATION>.
   The <LOCATION>Mississippi River</LOCATION> basin also is vulnerable because <LOCATION>Lake
Michigan</LOCATION>, where the mussels are expected to arrive soon, is
connected to the <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION> by the <ORGANIZATION>Chicago Canal</ORGANIZATION>.
   However, there is no reliable way to determine exactly when the
1{-inch mollusk will arrive in these or other rivers around the
country, scientists said.
   Zebra mussels, so named because of their brown and white zigzag
stripes, have been found in <LOCATION>Lake Erie</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Lake Ontario</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Lake St.
Clair</LOCATION>, near <LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION>.
   They are growing on spawning reefs favored by walleye,
smallmouth bass and other fish in western <LOCATION>Lake Erie</LOCATION>, raising
concern about the future of a valuable fishery.
   Like barnacles, zebra mussels can travel by clinging to boat
hulls. They can survive out of water for perhaps up to 14 days by
living on internal moisture.
   ``Let's say someone from <LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION> were to trailer their boat
up to fish on <LOCATION>Lake Erie</LOCATION> and ended up with zebra mussels that
attached to their hull,'' said <PERSON>David Kelch</PERSON>, a specialist with <ORGANIZATION>Ohio
State University</ORGANIZATION>'s sea grant program.
   ``They take their boat back to <LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION> and in a day or two
put the boat into a river or lake in that area. You've got them.''
   What's more, the larvae, or young, which are microscopic in
size, easily can attach themselves to an angler's minnow bucket, a
water nook in a boat trailer or the feathers of a duck.
   The zebra mussel originated in the Black and Caspian seas
between <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION>. In 200 years, it has spread through much
of <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>. Two years ago, it was discovered in <LOCATION>Lake St. Clair</LOCATION> and
has infested water intakes for <ORGANIZATION>Erie</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Toledo</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Monroe</PERSON>,
<LOCATION>Mich</LOCATION>.
   The mussel reproduces at an astonishing rate. A single female
produces as many as 40,000 eggs each breeding season.
   The mollusk also has a voracious appetite for phytoplankton,
which are microscopic floating plants that form the bottom of the
food chain. Mussels could reduce the supply of phytoplankton for
microscopic animals called zooplankton. The zooplankton, in turn,
are eaten by smaller fish, which are eaten for food by larger fish.
   ``Anytime you impact the basic bottom building block of the food
chain, you're going to see an impact on the top predators _
walleye, smallmouth bass, yellow perch,'' <PERSON>Kelch</PERSON> said.

   <LOCATION>Lake Erie</LOCATION> has the greatest infestation, but scientists hold out
hope that the other Great Lakes will experience only small
invasions because they don't have the rocky bottom structure <LOCATION>Lake
Erie</LOCATION> has.
   The zebra mussel is so dangerous because it can reproduce so
quickly. A fully mature female can produce more than 30,000 eggs
per season. The eggs are fertilized outside the shell and hatch
into free-swimming larvae called veligers.
   The veligers can remain suspended in the water for one to three
weeks, allowing currents to scatter them. If they don't settle on
firm objects in that time period, they die. Those that find a hard
surface attach to it with extremely strong tentacle-like threads.
The zebra mussel is mature at one year and can live to about 4
years old and grow to about 1{ inches long.
   ``The older they get, the tougher they are to remove,'' says
<PERSON>Gerry Mackie</PERSON>, a researcher at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Guelph</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Ontario</LOCATION>.
``Nothing or very few things can pry it off the rock. That makes it
tough for predators.''
   And the zebra mussel has few natural predators outside of the
diving duck and sheepshead fish.
   The zebra mussel has flourished in <LOCATION>Lake Erie</LOCATION>, where it filters
plankton from the water. An adult can filter about a quart of water
per day, and that's what concerns scientists about the impact on
the food chain.
   ``The current situation is the plankton is out in the open
water,'' <PERSON>Mills</PERSON> says. ``With the zebra mussel, which settles on the
bottom, they will be removing particles from the open water. More
of this food is going to be channeled to the bottom. Getting this
food to a salmon is going to be less efficient.''
   Researchers say it's too early to tell how the zeb mussel will
affect sport fishing. They say there could be an increase in mussel
predators such as the bottom-feeding sheepshead, but it's unknown
how they will affect more sought-after fish in the <LOCATION>Great Lakes</LOCATION>,
such as walleye and lake trout.
   <PERSON>Mackie</PERSON> says, however, there are some positive aspects to the
zebra mussel invasion. The zebra mussel's filtering ability is
making <LOCATION>Lake Erie</LOCATION> clearer.
   ``I've never seen <LOCATION>Lake Erie</LOCATION> look so nice as it has,'' <PERSON>LePage</PERSON>
says. ``I've seen the bottom of the lake in places that I've never
seen before.''
   In the <LOCATION>Netherlands</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>, researchers put the zebra
mussel's filtering ability to use in clarifying lakes. They also
use it as a biological monitor to detect what chemicals are in the
water.
   In the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>, a new industry has sprouted
around the zebra mussel. <ORGANIZATION>Dow Chemical Company</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Midland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mich.</LOCATION>,
and many others are developing anti-fouling boat coatings to keep
zebra mussels from attaching. The <ORGANIZATION>King Co.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Holland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mich.</LOCATION>, has
developed a bullet-shaped squeegee to scrape and remove zebra
mussels from water intake pipes.
   Researchers from around the country are watching <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> to see
whether it appropriates <MONEY>$37.5 million</MONEY> for research and control of
the zebra mussel. Others are refining methods to control the pest.
Most of those solutions are based on chlorine, which is fatal to
the zebra mussel. It's been used for the past 200 years in the
mollusk's native <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>.
   In <PERSON>Monroe</PERSON>, a chlorine spray jet has been installed at the mouth
of the water intake to treat the water as it enters the pipe.
   ``So far we are keeping them down,'' <PERSON>LePage</PERSON> says. ``Our intake
is as clean as a whistle.''
   <PERSON>Monroe</PERSON> used the <ORGANIZATION>King Co.</ORGANIZATION>'s squeegee to clean its intake pipe
after last year's invasion. The high-tech RotoRooter removed enough
mussels to fill six dump trucks. It cost the city <MONEY>$250,000</MONEY> to get
the system back to pre-mussel operating levels.
   The water plant sends divers down regularly to inspect the
intake for zebra mussel buildup. The city also is building a second
water intake designed to prevent another zebra mussel takeover. The
modifications will cost the city an extra <MONEY>$2 million</MONEY>, <PERSON>LePage</PERSON> says.
   To control the zebra mussel, Great Lakes researchers are trying
to learn all they can about the mussel's habits - its reproduction,
its predators and parasites, and its favorite nesting spots.
   At a recent meeting of zebra mussel experts from around the
world in <LOCATION>Saginaw</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mich.</LOCATION>, some said the best approach may be to find
ways to control and even anticipate all introduced species, not
just the zebra mussel. Other species recently introduced in the
Great Lakes are upsetting the food chain. They include the spiny
water flea and the ruffe, a fish limited mainly to the <LOCATION>Duluth</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Minn.</LOCATION>, area.
   The scientists proposed forming a center for the study of
introduced species, possibly to be established at a university in
the <LOCATION>Great Lakes</LOCATION>.
   ``It's going to take years of research before we get a
definitive answer,'' <PERSON>Mackie</PERSON> says.

Members of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> from <ORGANIZATION>Great Lakes</ORGANIZATION> states <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> introduced legislation to 
curb or eradicate the zebra mussel, a tiny shellfish that has infested <LOCATION>Lake 
Erie</LOCATION> and threatens to cause damage in other lakes and rivers. 
</P>
<P>
"The experts seem to think that this can spread very rapidly, just as it has in 
<LOCATION>Lake Erie</LOCATION>," said <PERSON>Sen. John Glenn</PERSON> (D-Ohio), a co-sponsor of the measure, which 
would authorize spending <MONEY>$4 million</MONEY> a year for five years for prevention 
programs and the same amount on eradication. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation would require freighters to dump their ballast water in the 
ocean at least 200 miles from the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> coast. 
</P>
<P>
The striped zebra mussel, usually no more than 1 1/2 inches long, is believed 
to have arrived in <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION> in <DATE>1986</DATE>, when a freighter from eastern <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> 
flushed its ballast water into <LOCATION>Lake St. Clair</LOCATION> or in the <LOCATION>St. Clair River</LOCATION> near 
<LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION>. The mussels have since spread down the length of the <LOCATION>Detroit River</LOCATION> and 
into <LOCATION>Lake Erie</LOCATION>, moving at about 160 miles a year. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. <PERSON>Carl Levin</PERSON> (D-Mich.) said that the mussels forced <PERSON>Monroe</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Mich.</LOCATION>, to ration 
water for several days because they had clogged drinking water intake pipes. 
</P>
<P>
"Over 50 other major municipal intake pipes in <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>, not to mention 
industry users, are at risk from this same type of fouling," <PERSON>Levin</PERSON> said. "They 
threaten the Great Lakes' <MONEY>$4-billion</MONEY> sports fish industry by robbing the fish 
and other aquatic species of essential food sources such as algae and 
plankton." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. <PERSON>John Heinz</PERSON> (R-Pa.) warned that the inedible shellfish can easily migrate 
into the <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> river systems, which "could become 
literally mussel-bound." 
</P>
<P>
A female zebra mussel lays up to 40,000 microscopic eggs in a year. 
</P>
<P>
An expert who investigated the problem for the <ORGANIZATION>Congressional Research Service</ORGANIZATION> 
found evidence that diving ducks and crawfish eat zebra mussels, but he warned 
that there may not be enough intact wetlands to provide habitat for more of the 
natural predators.

   Could it be that the hated zebra mussel isn't
all bad?
   Soviet scientists apparently think so, says an <ORGANIZATION>Environmental
Protection Agency</ORGANIZATION> official who is planning to visit <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> next
month in search of ideas for battling the tiny mollusks.
   Officials are frantically searching for a way to prevent
infestation of the Great Lakes by the pesky mussels, with their
zebra-like stripes.
   <PERSON>Valdas V. Adamkus</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>EPA</ORGANIZATION>'s national program manager for the
<ORGANIZATION>Great Lakes</ORGANIZATION>, said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> he had received some papers from Soviet
scientists who earlier notified him they had developed a biological
method of attacking the pest.
   Zebra mussels breed rapidly and attach themselves to municipal
water intake pipes.
   Much to his surprise, however, the papers said nothing about
ways to eradicate the mussel, <PERSON>Adamkus</PERSON> said. Instead, they described
the creature as useful because it can help control water pollution.
   ``They proved through their scientific work that zebra mussels
can be a cleansing agent,'' he said. ``So instead of trying to
reduce them, they are actually trying to ... increase their
population.
   ``We were surprised,'' he said. ``We're trying to eliminate the
zebra mussels and they are actually using them as an agent for
purification of water.''
   How the mussels could clean dirty water isn't clear, <PERSON>Adamkus</PERSON>
said. But the report has made him all the more eager to visit the
<LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>.
   ``I'm going to call on all the available scientists over there,
meet with them, get any information or whatever scientific work or
literature is available,'' he said.
   Last <DATE>summer</DATE>, the mussels clogged the water intake pipe of
<LOCATION>Monroe</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mich.</LOCATION>, restricting the flow through the 6,000-foot pipe by
nearly <PERCENT>24 percent</PERCENT>.
   Zebra mussels originated in <LOCATION>Eastern Europe</LOCATION>'s freshwater seas and
are believed to have entered the Great Lakes in the ballast water
of oceangoing vessels.
   They showed up in <LOCATION>Lake St. Clair</LOCATION> in <DATE>1987</DATE> and rapidly infested
<LOCATION>Lake Erie</LOCATION>. They have been spotted from <LOCATION>Duluth</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Minn.</LOCATION>, to <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>.
   In a related development, the <ORGANIZATION>House Appropriations Committee</ORGANIZATION>
voted <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> to spend <MONEY>$1 million</MONEY> for zebra mussel research at
the <ORGANIZATION>Great Lakes Research Laboratory</ORGANIZATION> at <PERSON>Ann Arbor</PERSON>.
   Another <MONEY>$3 million</MONEY> for zebra mussel study was reserved, pending
completion of legislation to authorize the Sea Grant program, said
Rep. <PERSON>Bob Carr</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-Mich.</LOCATION>, a committee member.
   The panel also set aside <MONEY>$1.4 million</MONEY> to combat the sea lamprey,
another Great Lakes pest.

<HEAD>Marauding Mollusks Threaten to Turn Great Lakes Into Mussel
Beaches</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Small, striped aliens that stowed away on
European freighters are threatening the security of <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION>'s
waterways, warn lawmakers who fear the <ORGANIZATION>Great Lakes</ORGANIZATION> will become
mussel beaches.
   The rapid spread of the marauding mollusks led legislators
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE> to introduce bills aimed at preventing further aquatic
invasions and battling the one underway by the dread zebra mussel.
   Unchecked, the exotic, inedible shellfish could cause <MONEY>$5 billion</MONEY>
in damage by the turn of the century and spread to two-thirds of
the nation's waterways, said <PERSON>Sen. John Glenn</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-Ohio</LOCATION>.
   ``I can tell you it's no joke,'' said <PERSON>Glenn</PERSON>, who was joined at a
news conference by seven lawmakers who want the federal government
to spend <MONEY>$40 million</MONEY> to research and control the barnacle-like
creature.
   ``We don't want to look a few years from now on what we should
have spent this year,'' said Rep. <PERSON>Fred Upton</PERSON>, <LOCATION>R-Mich.</LOCATION>, whose
district is bound by <LOCATION>Lake Michigan</LOCATION>. That lake so far is mussel-free
except for the bottom of one boat in <LOCATION>Green Bay</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wis</LOCATION>.
   The mussels, usually no more than 1{ inches long, are believed
to have been carried here from <LOCATION>Eastern Europe</LOCATION> three years ago in
the ballast water of freighters.
   They've multiplied dramatically because they spawn almost
continuously _ an adult female can produce upwards of 30,000 eggs
in a year _ and because there has been nothing to control the
spread of the alien mussels.
   An expert who investigated the problem for the <ORGANIZATION>Congressional
Research Service</ORGANIZATION> found evidence that diving ducks and crawfish eat
zebra mussels but warned that there may not be enough intact
wetlands to provide a habitat for more of the natural predators.
   There weren't enough predators to prevent 30 tons of mussels
from clogging a 2{-mile intake pipe at an <LOCATION>Ontario</LOCATION> water plant or
prevent mussels from accumulating up to two inches thick on screens
of the water intakes at five <ORGANIZATION>Cleveland Electric Illumination Co.</ORGANIZATION>
power plants.
   <PERSON>Monroe</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Mich.</LOCATION>, was forced to close its water plant for three
days after zebra mussels restricted water flow. <ORGANIZATION>Detroit Edison Co.</ORGANIZATION>
had to reduce the output of its <LOCATION>Monroe</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mich.</LOCATION> plant by <PERCENT>25 percent</PERCENT>
because one of its pipes became coated with the mussels.
   <PERSON>Sen. Arlen Specter</PERSON>, <LOCATION>R-Pa.</LOCATION>, said a <MONEY>$29 million</MONEY> breakwall that
took a decade to get for <LOCATION>Presque Isle</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Lake Erie</LOCATION> is being
jeopardized by zebra mussels.
   And <PERSON>Sen. John Heinz</PERSON>, <LOCATION>R-Pa.</LOCATION>, warned that the shellfish can easily
migrate into the <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> river systems,
which ``could become literally mussel-bound.''
   And there's more. Dead zebra mussels can produce ``offensive
quantities of methane gas,'' according to the congressional
research report. When they die in the pipes of water treatment
systems they can give the water a foul taste and smell. Once they
wash ashore, the mussels' sharp shells can rip up the bare feet of
beach walkers.
   Rep. <PERSON>Dennis Eckart</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-Ohio</LOCATION>, said the mussels already endanger
the fisheries of <LOCATION>Lake Erie</LOCATION> by stripping the lake of microscopic
feeder plants.
   When the bottom of the aquatic food chain collapses, ``the net
result is there will be no little baby fish left in <LOCATION>Lake Erie</LOCATION> to
grow up to be big fish,'' said <PERSON>Eckart</PERSON>, who added he's worried about
the impact on a newly revived sportfishing and recreation economy.
   ``It's another one of those unwanted foreign imports that's
costing us jobs,'' he said.
   The bills introduced by <PERSON>Glenn</PERSON> in the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> and Rep. <PERSON>Henry
Nowak</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-N.Y.</LOCATION>, in the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> would authorize spending <MONEY>$4 million</MONEY> a
year for five years to control the mussels and the same amount on
prevention programs to protect <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> waters from other foreign
invaders.
   In addition, the bills require freighters to dump their ballast
water in the ocean, at least 200 miles from the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> coast.

<HEAD>Report: Pesky Zebra Mussels Found in Hudson</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The zebra mussel, a fast-breeding type of
shellfish that clogs the intake pipes of power plants, has been
found in the <LOCATION>Hudson River</LOCATION> for the first time, scientists said.
   The mussels, which had not been seen east of the central section
of the <ORGANIZATION>Erie Canal</ORGANIZATION>, were found off <LOCATION>Croton Point</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Westchester
County</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION>'s northern suburbs. It was identified
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE> by experts at the <ORGANIZATION>New York Zebra Mussel Information
Clearinghouse</ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION>State University of New York</ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION>Brockport</LOCATION>.
   ``It is the first confirmed North American sighting of the
mussel outside of the Great Lakes drainage basin,'' <PERSON>Charles O'Neill
Jr.</PERSON>, a supervisor at the clearinghouse, told <ORGANIZATION>The New York Times</ORGANIZATION> in
a story published today.
   O'Neill noted that the zebra mussel, classified as a freshwater
animal, is not usually found in saltwater like the lower Hudson.
   ``It raises a lot of questions that we don't have answers for,''
he said.
   The zebra mussel, a native of <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, was first found in the
<LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> in <DATE>1988</DATE> in <LOCATION>Lake St. Clair</LOCATION>, east of <LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION>.
   Named for its dark brown stripes on a tan shell, the mussel
breeds quickly and can clog the intake pipes of power plants and
eats microscopic plants at the base of the food chain for
freshwater fish.
   In areas where the mussels have taken hold, utilities have
fought back by flushing pipes with treated water, cleaning intake
screens by hand and using chlorine and other chemicals to kill
them.
   The <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Fish</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Wildlife Service</ORGANIZATION> has estimated that the
expanding population of the mussels could add <MONEY>$500 million</MONEY> a year
in added costs for utilities, water companies and factories and
loss of business in sports fishing, marinas and motels along inland
waterways.

   <PERSON>Wilfred LePage</PERSON> saw his first zebra mussel <DATE>Feb. 1</DATE>. By <DATE>September</DATE>,
thousands of the tiny molluscs jammed the intake of the water
treatment plant he manages, cutting the flow <PERCENT>20 percent</PERCENT> and nearly
sparking a water emergency.
   ``There is no cheap solution to it and there's no real cure to
the problem,'' said <PERSON>LePage</PERSON>, water treatment superintendent in
<LOCATION>Monroe</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mich.</LOCATION>, on <LOCATION>Lake Erie</LOCATION>'s western edge.
   At the eastern end of the lake, in <LOCATION>Dunkirk</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>, the
green-and-yellow striped shellfish first appeared <DATE>Oct. 3</DATE>, and now
infest a <ORGANIZATION>Niagara Mohawk Power Corp.</ORGANIZATION> generating plant. <DATE>December</DATE>'s
deep freeze stopped them from clogging water intakes but they
quickly settled inside the plant.
   ``They like it where it's dimly lit, they like it where it's
warm, and they don't like a lot of turbulence. This place is ideal
for them,'' said <PERSON>Robert C. Henderson</PERSON>, a chemical lab supervisor at
the plant. ``By <DATE>July</DATE>, we're going to have a massive problem with
them.''
   Three years after they were introduced to <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION> and
after only one year in <LOCATION>Lake Erie</LOCATION>, zebra mussels have spread
throughout the lake and have been spotted at the entrance to <LOCATION>Lake
Ontario</LOCATION> and along the <LOCATION>St. Lawrence River</LOCATION>. It's an invasion
scientists say could affect farming, fishing and daily life along
virtually every body of fresh water in <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION> in the next
few years.
   The mussels are mostly about a half-inch long, although they can
reach 2 inches during their five-year lifespans. They eat by
filtering microscopic food particles from the water, and love
intake pipes of water and power plants because the current brings
them a steady supply of fresh food.
   A mussel can filter more than a gallon of water an hour, said <PERSON>R.
Warren Flint</PERSON>, a scientist with the <ORGANIZATION>Great Lakes Program</ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION>State
University of New York-Buffalo</ORGANIZATION>. As a result, they will leave water
cleaner than before. ``From an aesthetic perspective, that would
certainly be a benefit, I guess,'' he said.
   Europeans have used zebra mussels to clean algae-choked ponds,
and the shells can be used to add calcium to livestock feed, said
<PERSON>Charles O'Neill</PERSON>, with the Sea Grant program at the <ORGANIZATION>State University
College</ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION>Brockport</LOCATION>.
   The mussels also are a good source of food for diving ducks and
some kinds of fish, including sturgeons and eels, <LOCATION>Flint</LOCATION> said. But
with millions of them at work filtering microscopic food, they
could deplete the supply for the small fish that support the
billion-dollar walleye- and bass-fishing industry.
   And the bad news could spread beyond the lake and its shoreline.
Farmers and golf courses that draw irrigation water from the lakes
can expect problems, and beachgoers will have to wear shoes because
of the shells, <PERSON>O'Neill</PERSON> said.
   ``It can affect everything from the electricity at your outlet
to the water at your tap,'' <PERSON>O'Neill</PERSON> said. ``It's not just an
environmental problem.''
   Like their distant cousins, the blue mussels, zebras ought, in
theory, to be edible by humans, <LOCATION>Flint</LOCATION> said. But when Canadian
researchers tried steaming a bunch, <PERSON>O'Neill</PERSON> said, ``What they got
was a stench that cleared the lab.''
   The mussels have plagued <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> for more than a century and are
believed to have arrived in <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION> on a freighter that
emptied its ballast tanks in <LOCATION>Lake St. Clair</LOCATION>, upstream from <LOCATION>Lake
Erie</LOCATION>, in <DATE>1986</DATE>.
   Scientists are studying the possibility that the <LOCATION>Lake Erie</LOCATION>
infestations came from several ships rather than that single <DATE>1986</DATE>
event, <PERSON>O'Neill</PERSON> said. But <LOCATION>Flint</LOCATION> said one colony could have infested
the lake because one mussel can lay 30,000 to 50,000 eggs a year
and the larvae can swim for up to two weeks before growing shells.
``They could easily get across <LOCATION>Lake Erie</LOCATION> or <LOCATION>Lake Ontario</LOCATION> in that
period of time,'' he said.
   For public water systems, controlling the mussels is a matter of
applying chlorine, ozone or other disinfectants at the mouth of the
intake pipe rather than waiting until the water is inside the
plant, say scientists and plant operators like <PERSON>LePage</PERSON> who have
already faced the problem.
   Power plants have a different problem, because officials are
reluctant to let them put chlorine or other disinfectants in
cooling water discharged back to the lake, <PERSON>Henderson</PERSON> said. Niagara
Mohawk and the state <ORGANIZATION>Department of Environmental Conservation</ORGANIZATION> are
negotiating a solution.
   <PERSON>James Sell</PERSON>, chief operator of the <LOCATION>Dunkirk</LOCATION> water plant, is
studying ways of getting chlorine to the pipe's mouth, like
building a platform over the intake or running a smaller chlorine
pipe out through the intake. ``We're better off than the people in
the western end of the lake,'' <PERSON>Sell</PERSON> said.
   ``At least we have some time to do something by <DATE>spring</DATE>.''
   The <ORGANIZATION>City Council</ORGANIZATION> hasn't been persuaded to pay up to <MONEY>$100,000</MONEY> for
the plans, but Sell, who keeps three living mussels in a jar to
show visitors, said, ``I don't see much option for them if they
want a water supply.''
   Farther inland, many water officials are unaware of the problem
or not prepared to do anything about it. <PERSON>Michael Burke</PERSON>, director of
the state <ORGANIZATION>Health Department</ORGANIZATION>'s bureau of public water supply
protection, said the department was studying the problem but
doesn't see the need to issue warnings. ``I think the word's
getting to them, particularly those with large surface intakes in
the <LOCATION>Great Lakes</LOCATION>. It is coming out in industry papers and things of
that sort.''
   O'Neill and other scientists said the state should do more to
get the word out, because it is only a matter of time _ and not
necessarily very much time.
   ``The chances of them getting into the western reach of the <ORGANIZATION>Erie
Canal</ORGANIZATION> is good,'' <PERSON>O'Neill</PERSON> said. ``The canal is an ideal place for
them to live. It's warm. It's shallow. Most of it has rock riprap
to attach to.''
   Pleasure boats can also carry mussels and their larvae in their
engine housings and other places where water collects.
   Once the mussels get into <LOCATION>Lake Michigan</LOCATION>, they will almost
certainly spread through the <LOCATION>Chicago River</LOCATION> and into the <LOCATION>Mississippi
River</LOCATION> basin, <PERSON>O'Neill</PERSON> said. ``Any area in <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION> that is
utilizing surface water should be concerned.''

   NEW YORK -- A subsidiary of Coltec Industries Inc. says it
has a better way to combat the zebra mussel, the
fast-breeding mollusk pest that is clogging up America's
water pipes.
   Garlick Valves &amp; Industrial Plastics, a Camden, N.J., unit
of New York-based Coltec, said it has produced a plastic pipe
material in which a mollusk-killing chemical is embedded. The
chemically treated pipe keeps the mussels out of their
favorite breeding places -- water intake pipes, valves and
debris gates -- where they create problems for water
authorities and power generation plants.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Utility officials pointed out that many companies have
been touting products and services with varying degrees of
effectiveness against the persistent pest.
   The zebra mussel, native to <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, was discovered in the
<LOCATION>Great Lakes</LOCATION> in the <DATE>1980s</DATE>; biologists believe they arrived in
the ballast of European freighters that moved in the lakes.
The mussel grows to about thumbnail-size, and breeds
profusely, up to concentrations of nearly a million per
square meter of surface. It causes havoc by clogging water
intake pipes of boats, factories, public water facilities and
irrigation systems. Various estimates of the cost of cleanup
and control of the zebra mussel over the next several years
run in the <MONEY>billions of dollars</MONEY>.
   <PERSON>Adam Patarcity</PERSON>, operations manager for <ORGANIZATION>Garlick Valves</ORGANIZATION>,
said the product, called Z-Gard, is a version of its
ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene to which a
molluscicide is added. The current slick-surfaced
polyethylene hasn't prevented the zebra mussels from
attaching, but the new plastic has been very effective, after
tests at 11 sites in <LOCATION>Great Lakes</LOCATION>, he said.
   The worst areas of infestation in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> are <LOCATION>Lake Erie</LOCATION>,
particularly the southern shore around <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Lake
Huron</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION> area. Removal of the mussels currently
must be done mechanically, by scraping or blasting with
high-pressure water, or by chemical treatment of the water.
<PERSON>Mr. Patarcity</PERSON> said that unlike previous efforts to control
the mussels, the chemical in its new pipe material won't
leach out into the water and threaten the environment.
   Z-Gard joins a growing list of ostensible mussel-stoppers,
and its potential market has a wait-and-see attitude. "Every
day we have people calling to offer a silver bullet" for the
problem, said <PERSON>William Kovalak</PERSON>, a biologist for <ORGANIZATION>Detroit Edison
Co.</ORGANIZATION> "So we take more of a passive stance. We let them come in
and put their product in the water, and if it works, we can
use it without having invested much." He said some
silicone-based chemical coatings for intake areas seem to
work well, adding that <ORGANIZATION>Detroit Edison</ORGANIZATION> facilities on lakes
Erie and Huron have some of the worst mussel concentrations
in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>

<HEAD>Zebra Mussel Infestation of Great Lakes Could Be Costly</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Zebra mussels accidentally imported to
the <ORGANIZATION>Great Lakes</ORGANIZATION> in the <DATE>last four years</DATE> are threatening commercial
and sport fishing and forcing cities and industries into costly
measures to protect water supplies.
   The 2-inch-long mollusk, first dropped off an ocean-going
freighter in <LOCATION>Lake St. Clair</LOCATION> outside <LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION>, has spread through
<LOCATION>Lake Erie</LOCATION> and a colony was found in <LOCATION>Lake Michigan</LOCATION> near <LOCATION>Green Bay</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Wis.</LOCATION>, said <PERSON>Michael Donahue</PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION>Great Lakes
Commission</ORGANIZATION>, headquartered in <LOCATION>Ann Arbor</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mich</LOCATION>.
   Intake pipes for industrial plants and municipal water systems
are among favorite breeding grounds for the greenish-striped
mussel. Monroe, <LOCATION>Mich.</LOCATION>, just south of <LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION>, is designing a system
to bathe the mouth of its intake system with ozone-infused water in
hopes of killing the mussels' larvae, but there is very little that
apparently can be done to stem the surge of the mussels.
   Cleveland is also facing heavy bills to rid itself of an
infestation, and <LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION> has been forced to partially close its
water plant.
   ``I will guarantee you that it may be <LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION>'s

problem in the near future,'' <PERSON>Donahue</PERSON> said. ``There's just no way

   In addition, the mussels feed voraciously on algae that other
fish and mollusks need, and could devastate <LOCATION>Lake Erie</LOCATION>'s walleye
pike _ one of the lake's most important commercial fish, by
covering spawning grounds, said <PERSON>Jon Stanley</PERSON>, of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Fish and

   ``Those actions in <LOCATION>Lake Erie</LOCATION>, we expect, will reduce the walleye

<HEAD>Spread of Zebra Mussels Inland Feared After Lake Superior
Discovery</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DULUTH, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists say the zebra mussel will spread
to inland waters following the first confirmed sightings in Lake
Superior.
   ``This isn't going to just affect anglers,'' said <PERSON>Dennis Pratt</PERSON>,
western Lake Superior fisheries manager for the <ORGANIZATION>Wisconsin
Department of Natural Resources</ORGANIZATION>. ``This one's going to affect
industry, boaters ... and the ecosystem is going to take it on the
chin.''
   Discovery in <DATE>March</DATE> of the mussel in the Twin Ports of <LOCATION>Duluth</LOCATION> and
Superior, <LOCATION>Wis.</LOCATION>, proves the pest is established in all the <LOCATION>Great
Lakes</LOCATION>, scientists say.
   The invader brought via the <PERSON>St. Lawrence Seaway</PERSON> in the ballast
of European freighters was found last month on eight of 26 <LOCATION>St.
Louis River</LOCATION> buoys inspected.
   Experts say the half-inch, barnacle-like shellfish multiply so
fast that colonies of millions may turn up soon. They can clog
water valves, foul city water systems and pollute beaches.
   ``They have a two-year reproductive cycle. I think you'll start
seeing them next year in big numbers,'' <PERSON>Pratt</PERSON> said. And once
they're here, there's almost nothing that can be done to stop them,
<PERSON>Pratt</PERSON> said.
   Zebra mussels have caused <MONEY>millions of dollars</MONEY> in damage in <LOCATION>Lake
Erie</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Lake St. Clair</LOCATION>. Great Lakes environmental officials say
virtually all the hard surfaces in the two lakes are covered with
zebra mussel beds at least an inch thick.
   The creatures also have accumulated two inches thick and clogged

   Scientists say the zebra mussel will spread
to inland waters following the first confirmed sightings in Lake
Superior.
   ``This isn't going to just affect anglers,'' said <PERSON>Dennis Pratt</PERSON>,
western Lake Superior fisheries manager for the <ORGANIZATION>Wisconsin
Department of Natural Resources</ORGANIZATION>. ``This one's going to affect
industry, boaters ... and the ecosystem is going to take it on the
chin.''
   Discovery in <DATE>March</DATE> of the mussel in the Twin Ports of <LOCATION>Duluth</LOCATION> and
Superior, <LOCATION>Wis.</LOCATION>, proves the pest is established in all the <LOCATION>Great
Lakes</LOCATION>, scientists say.
   The invader brought via the <PERSON>St. Lawrence Seaway</PERSON> in the ballast
of European freighters was found last month on eight of 26 <LOCATION>St.
Louis River</LOCATION> buoys inspected.
   Experts say the half-inch, barnacle-like shellfish multiply so
fast that colonies of millions may turn up soon. They can clog
water valves, foul city water systems and pollute beaches.
   ``They have a two-year reproductive cycle. I think you'll start
seeing them next year in big numbers,'' <PERSON>Pratt</PERSON> said. And once
they're here, there's almost nothing that can be done to stop them,
<PERSON>Pratt</PERSON> said.
   Zebra mussels have caused <MONEY>millions of dollars</MONEY> in damage in <LOCATION>Lake
Erie</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Lake St. Clair</LOCATION>. Great Lakes environmental officials say
virtually all the hard surfaces in the two lakes are covered with
zebra mussel beds at least an inch thick.
   The creatures also have accumulated two inches thick and clogged
water intakes at five <ORGANIZATION>Cleveland Electric Illumination Co.</ORGANIZATION> power
plants. <PERSON>Monroe</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Mich.</LOCATION>, was forced to close its water plant for
three days when zebra mussels were so thick on intake pipes they

<HEAD>European Mollusks Invading Great Lakes Are Here To Stay</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   By <ORGANIZATION>JEFFREY ULBRICH&equals;
Associated Press Writer&</ORGANIZATION>equals;
   <LOCATION>TORONTO</LOCATION> (AP) _ A small European freshwater mollusk called the
zebra mussel has spread at an alarming rate since it was found in
the Great Lakes in <DATE>1988</DATE>, threatening the ecosystem and clogging up
industry.
   Experts say there is no way to wipe the mussels out.
   ``In the <ORGANIZATION>Great Lakes</ORGANIZATION>, all we can do is accept the fact that they
are here and learn to live with it,'' said <PERSON>Gerry Mackie</PERSON>, a biology
professor at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Guelph</ORGANIZATION> who specializes in freshwater
bivalves.
   Criticism in <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> focuses on the government's slowness in
attacking the problem.
   ``The invasion of the zebra mussels was preventable,'' the
<ORGANIZATION>Toronto Globe</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Mail</PERSON> said in an editorial. ``<LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>'s complacency
let it happen, and may enable similar invasions unless the country
takes strong preventive measures.''
   <PERSON>Joe Comuzzi</PERSON>, a Liberal member of <ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION>, complained recently
that <LOCATION>Ottawa</LOCATION> had committed only <MONEY>$230,000</MONEY> (<MONEY>$195,500</MONEY> <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>) to the
problem. He said that ``doesn't even pay for the paper to write a
report.''
   The mussel invasion has been expensive for <ORGANIZATION>Ontario Hydro</ORGANIZATION>, which
has power plants along the lake shore.
   Zebra mussels produce a sticky thread that attaches them to
solid objects _ water pipes in <LOCATION>Ontario Hydro</LOCATION>'s case. The mussels
are capable of sticking in such numbers that they stop or greatly
reduce the flow of water.
   Large intake pipes are not affected, but the mussels swim up
into the small-diameter service piping inside the plants.
   Their presence also leads to corrosion.
   ``It has cost us well over <MONEY>$6 million</MONEY> to retrofit all of the
stations for this year, and it's costing us lots in research,''
said <PERSON>Renata Claudi</PERSON>, a senior scientist with the utility company.
   Representatives of 13 companies in the <ORGANIZATION>Chemical Valley</ORGANIZATION> of
<LOCATION>Sarnia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ontario</LOCATION>, got together this month to work out a common
strategy against the mollusks.
   The zebra mussel, about 1{ inches in diameter, is a
dark-colored, clam-like creature with white stripes.
   It has a larval stage of about a month when it swims with the
currents. That accounts for much of its rapid spread throug the
Great Lakes.
   Some of the mollusks hitch rides on ships up the lakes through
<LOCATION>Huron</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> and Superior and others swim down the current into
the St. <PERSON>Lawrence Seaway</PERSON>.
   A female produces 30,000 to 40,000 eggs in each of its two or
three years of life.
   Experts agree zebra mussels entered the Great Lakes system in
<LOCATION>Lake St. Clair</LOCATION> in the <DATE>summer of 1985</DATE> or <DATE>1986</DATE>. They probably were
flushed from the ballast of a ship that came from <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>.
   All the Great Lakes now are infested and scientists say their
passage into the <LOCATION>Mississippi River</LOCATION> system is inevitable.
   ``They have gone through the <LOCATION>Niagara River</LOCATION> and into <LOCATION>Lake
Ontario</LOCATION>,'' <PERSON>Ms. Claudi</PERSON> said. ``Now they are swimming their way
toward <LOCATION>Toronto</LOCATION>.''
   Scientists are not sure what the ecological impact will be, but
are fearful of it.
   ``You have to keep it in perspective,'' said <PERSON>Joe Leach</PERSON>, a
research scientist with the <ORGANIZATION>Ontario Natural Resources Ministry</ORGANIZATION>.
``The major impacts right now are with the technical devices, pipes
and so on. We ... are looking at potention impacts on ... fishes,
but at the present time there is no indication of major ecological
impact.''
   <PERSON>Leach</PERSON> said the main fears were disruption of spawning for fish
like walleye, which lay their eggs on hard, rocky areas, and that
the food chain would be altered.
   ``These things are filter feeders,'' he said. ``They filter an
enormous amount of water and take everything out of it. What they
don't use, they put mucus around and drop it down to the bottom.''
   That shifts a lot of organic matter from the water to the bottom
of the lake. <PERSON>Leach</PERSON> said it eventually could change fish populations
by reducing the number of water column feeders, such as walleye and
trout, and increasing catfish, sturgeon and other bottom feeders.
   There also is increasing evidence of zebra mussels attaching to
other bivalves and smothering them.
   ``As it stands now, there isn't anything you can do,'' <PERSON>Leach</PERSON>
said. ``There is no way you can control them. If you use poison,
you are going to poison the system.''
   <ORGANIZATION>Ontario Hydro</ORGANIZATION> uses chlorine, the most effective molluscicide
found so far.
   In one affected plant, <PERSON>Ms. Claudi</PERSON> said, the company ``applied
sodium hypochlorite in relatively small doses for about two weeks.
That basically did them in and all we had to worry about was
cleaning out the shells.''
   She added that the amount used, in an agreement with the
<ORGANIZATION>Environment Ministry</ORGANIZATION>, ``is never more than 10 parts per billion.
Compare that with the five parts per million of the same stuff in
the drinking water we happily drink every day.''
   <PERSON>Ms. Claudi</PERSON> says <PERSON>Ontario Hydro</PERSON> was talking to other utilities
across the lakes, the <ORGANIZATION>American Waterworks Association and Electric
Power Research Association</ORGANIZATION>, ``but we're finding that we are way
ahead or at the same level as these guys'' in research.
   Most experts believe the zebra mussel population eventually will
level off and perhaps even decline, but <PERSON>Mackie</PERSON> said the problem was
``trying to determine at what point they will level off or if they
will crash.''
   <PERSON>Geoff Holland</PERSON> of the federal fisheries and oceans department
said Canadian officials probably would meet with provincial and
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> representatives this fall to work out a budget for fighting
the zebra mussel.
   As for <ORGANIZATION>Ontario Hydro</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Ms. Claudi</PERSON> said: ``Prevention is really
what we're looking at. We just don't want those guys in our pipe.''

<HEAD>Discovery Of Zebra Mussels In Hudson River Startles Scientists</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   CROTON-ON-HUDSON, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION> (AP) - The discovery of zebra mussels in
the brackish waters of the <LOCATION>Hudson River</LOCATION> startled scientists, who
said <DATE>Thursday</DATE> the pests weren't supposed to get this far south this
soon.
   ``We've just thrown the book out now,'' <PERSON>Avery Klauber</PERSON>, a
spokesman for <LOCATION>New York Sea Grant</LOCATION> at the <ORGANIZATION>State University of New
York</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Stony Brook</LOCATION>. ``There's no way of knowing how far and how
fast they're going to travel.''
   Experts didn't expect the tiny mussel, named for its striped
shell, to appear in the Hudson until next year or the year after.
Scientists also had hoped the waters of the lower <PERSON>Hudson</PERSON>, with a
salinity of eight parts per thousand, would be too salty for the
mussels.
   They have been spreading through the Great Lakes since <DATE>1988</DATE>,
when scientists think European ships released them with ballast
water.
   The mussels have few natural predators and breed rapidly,
causing problems for industries, power plants, public water systems
and boaters by clogging water intakes. They can also wreak havoc on
aquatic food chains.
   Federal officials have estimated that control of the mussels
could cost as much as <MONEY>$5 billion</MONEY> over the next decade in the <LOCATION>Great
Lakes</LOCATION> region.
   The <LOCATION>Hudson River</LOCATION> discovery is the first North American sighting
of the pest outside the Great Lakes drainage basin, said <PERSON>Charles
O'Neill</PERSON>, supervisor of the <ORGANIZATION>New York Zebra Mussel Information
Clearinghouse</ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION>State University of New York</ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION>Brockport</LOCATION>.
   ``Everybody was watching to see where they'd turn up out of the
<LOCATION>Great Lakes</LOCATION>,'' <PERSON>O'Neill</PERSON> said. ``This one being such a jump opens up
the possibility that the mussels can be really widely scattered.''
   The animals were discovered by accident on a piece of wood
collected for an museum exhibit from <LOCATION>Haverstraw Bay</LOCATION>, about 25 miles
north of <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION>, <PERSON>O'Neill</PERSON> said, adding it was too early to
tell the extent of the infestation.
   He said the mussels may have been brought to the river by a
Great Lakes pleasure boat or a European ship, or even by a piece of
wood floating from the <ORGANIZATION>Erie Canal</ORGANIZATION> to the <LOCATION>Mohawk River</LOCATION> and on into
the <LOCATION>Hudson</LOCATION>.
   The discovery of the mussels is particularly worrisome to
officials of four major power plants near the discovery site,
<PERSON>O'Neill</PERSON> said.
   Experts expect zebra mussels eventually to find their way into
the <LOCATION>Mississippi River</LOCATION> through canals connecting it to the Great
Lakes. From there, they could spread across the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>.
   ``We're looking at a critter that within the next couple
generations could very possibly be found throughout <LOCATION>North
America</LOCATION>,'' <PERSON>O'Neill</PERSON> said.
   In <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Sen. Daniel P. Moynihan</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-N.Y.</LOCATION>, issued a plea to
President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> <DATE>Thursday</DATE> to sign legislation authorizing <MONEY>$60 million</MONEY>
for project grants and research funding to control the mussels.

<TEXT>
   The zebra mussel is one of many exotic species
invading <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> waters, and a broad strategy is needed to keep them
from wreaking economic and environmental havoc, experts said
<DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
   The river ruffe, spiny water flea and tube-nosed goby soon may
become as familiar to the Great Lakes as the zebra mussel,
witnesses said at a hearing of the <ORGANIZATION>Senate Subcommittee on
Environmental Protection</ORGANIZATION>.
   Meanwhile, the asiatic clam, Japanese seaweed and the red tide
are damaging shellfish and marine industries along the ocean coasts.
   The newcomers threaten many native species, interrupt the food
chain and pose a danger to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> fishing industry and other
segments of the economy, said <PERSON>Gillman D. Veith</PERSON>, director of the
<ORGANIZATION>Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Research and
Development</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``Given the rate of technological change and movement of people,
it is likely that the problems resulting from invasions of
non-native species will increase,'' said <PERSON>Veith</PERSON>.
   The city of <LOCATION>Monroe</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mich.</LOCATION>, was forced to ration water for
several days and spend <MONEY>$500,000</MONEY> removing zebra mussels from its
water intake pipe last year, said <PERSON>Sen. Herb Kohl</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-Wis</LOCATION>. Shipping,
tourism, paper production and other industries could be affected if
such problems become widespread, he said.
   ``There is growing concern that the introduction of
non-indigenous species by ships, particularly through their ballast
water, has affected the ecosystems and economies of countries
around the world,'' said Capt. <PERSON>Thomas E. Thompson</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Coast
Guard</ORGANIZATION>.
   Bills pending in the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> would order the <ORGANIZATION>Coast
Guard</ORGANIZATION> to develop and enforce regulations on dumping of ships'
ballast water _ the suspected source of zebra mussels, which are
native to fresh-water bodies of <LOCATION>Eastern Europe</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>.
   The tiny bivalves with zebra-like stripes have spread with
lightning speed through the Great Lakes since their arrival in
<DATE>1986</DATE>. They fasten themselves to hard surfaces, such as pipes and
boat hulls, and ingest plankton essential to the aquatic food chain.
   Senators from the region urged quick action and braodening the
scopes of the bills to deal with other natural invaders.

<HEAD>Senate Adds $20 Million to Farm Bill to Stop Zebra Mussel Spread</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> has approved a <MONEY>$20 million</MONEY> research
and prevention program to keep zebra mussels from invading farm
irrigation systems.
   The striped mollusk, which is not native to <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION>, has
caused problems at water and power plants throughout the Great
Lakes. They attach to water intake pipes and clog them.
   An amendment authorizing the <MONEY>$20 million</MONEY> over five years was
added to the <DATE>1990</DATE> farm bill by <PERSON>Sen. Daniel P. Moynihan</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-N.Y.</LOCATION>
   ``Unlike other infestations, this one is irreversible,''
<PERSON>Moynihan</PERSON> said in a statement <DATE>Thursday</DATE>. ``The zebra mussel is here
to stay ... Within 20 years' time it will have spread through the
entire surface water system of <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION>.''
   The amendment, which the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> passed <DATE>late Wednesday</DATE>, directs
the <ORGANIZATION>Department of Agriculture</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Army Corps of Engineers</ORGANIZATION>
to develop a program of research, prevention and design criteria
for irrigation systems with an emphasis on keeping the mussels out.
   On <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, scientists expressed surprise that the tiny
mollusks are spreading through the <ORGANIZATION>Erie Canal</ORGANIZATION> system from <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>, and now threaten <LOCATION>Rochester</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION> and the Finger Lakes region.
   ``Frankly, I did not think their advance would be this fast,''
said <PERSON>Cameron Lange</PERSON>, a biologist studying the mussels' movement for
a consortium of power companies.
   ``I thought we might find a few at <LOCATION>Lockport</LOCATION> during our <DATE>late July</DATE>
sample but I did not think they'd reach Rochester by now.''
   Rochester is about 60 miles east of <LOCATION>Lockport</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>
   In <DATE>May</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works</ORGANIZATION>
authorized <MONEY>$37.5 million</MONEY> in grants and research funding for control
of the mussel. The provision is part of the pending Water Resources
Development Act of <DATE>1990</DATE>.

   Yet another foreign invader has ignored the

   A tube-nosed goby, a 3-inch-long fish from the Black Sea region
of the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>, was recently found on an intake screen at the
<ORGANIZATION>Detroit Edison Co.</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>Belle River</LOCATION> plant on the <LOCATION>St. Clair River</LOCATION>.
   But the goby doesn't appear threatening, unlike a host of other
invaders, including the water pipe-clogging zebra mussel, the
trout-killing sea lamprey, and the beach-befouling alewife.
   Like other non-native critters, the goby probably got to the
Great Lakes by hitching a ride on ocean freighters which take on
water _ and any small free-swimming animals that happen to be in
the way _ for ballast. When the ship reaches port on the Great
Lakes to take on cargo, the ballast gets dumped.
   Threatening or no, the goby isn't welcome.

<TEXT>     Now, thanks to the latest National Geographic TV special, "Great Lakes,
Fragile Seas" (<DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, <TIME>8 p.m.</TIME>, <LOCATION>Ch</LOCATION>. 9), we can learn a lot more about the
lakes and the imposing challenges that threaten their long-term survival.;   
This excellent hour documentary, written, produced and photographed by <PERSON>Joe
Seamans</PERSON>, contains some facts that may amaze most of us, including:;    (box) 
The five lakes -- <LOCATION>Ontario</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Erie</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Huron</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> and Superior -- hold at least
six quadrillion gallons of water, enough to flood all 48 contiguous states to
a depth of 10 feet.;    (box)  The largest lakes are so huge that they
frequently have stormy "seas" that rival those found in the world's oceans.;  
 (box)  More than 10,000 vessels have sunk while crossing the Great Lakes.;   
(box)  The flow in the lakes is so complex that it may take nearly 100 years
for toxic chemicals to completely wash out of their waters.;    (box)  The
lakes contain about <PERCENT>20 percent</PERCENT> of all the fresh water on the planet.;   
Scooped out by glacial action about 20,000 years ago, the Great Lakes face
several simultaneous ecological crises brought about by humans' intense use of
their waters in just the past 200 years.;    <PERSON>Seamans</PERSON>' camera shows us deformed
fish and birds, genetically damaged by toxic chemicals still present in the
waters despite heroic efforts to clean them up after a <DATE>1972</DATE> pact between the
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and Canadian governments.;    We also see what amounts to "biological
pollution" from the destructive Zebra mussels, now multiplying rapidly in the
lakes and destroying the natural food chain by siphoning off up to <PERCENT>50 percent</PERCENT>
of all nutrients needed by native lake species.;    Experts studying the
problem believe that the mussels, native to the Caspian and Black seas, were
carried into the lakes by seagoing foreign vessels. If Americans and Canadians
hadn't built a complex system of locks and waterways, linking the lakes to the
<LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION>, these marauders never would have turned up.;     Diversity of life; 
Originally, lakes <LOCATION>Ontario</LOCATION> and Erie were linked only by the <LOCATION>Niagara River</LOCATION>. The
spectacular <ORGANIZATION>Niagara Falls</ORGANIZATION> served as a natural barrier to invasion of outside
species. But the human-made bypass of the falls opened the doorway to what may
be ecological disaster.;    <PERSON>Seamans</PERSON>' far-ranging film aptly demonstrates the
diversity of life on the lakes, beyond the skyscraper-lined cities along their
shores. For example, we visit remote <LOCATION>Madeline Island</LOCATION> on Lake Superior, which
is reached only by "wind sleds" during the icy winters, and a Chippewa Indian
community, where wild rice is harvested in preserved wetlands the same way it
was 200 years ago.;    Wreckage explored; In what may be the film's most
bizarre excursion, we probe the depths of Lake Superior by robot mini-sub to
explore the wreckage of the 729-foot steel freighter <PERSON>Edmund Fitzgerald</PERSON>, which
split in half and sank during a tremendous storm in <DATE>1975.</DATE>;    Though "Great
Lakes, Fragile Seas" does include some sobering information, it's not a
downer. Progress is being made in halting the environmental threats to the
lakes. They're even pulling big, beautiful, edible fish from the same waters
that once caught fire; so it seems there is cause for cautious optimism after
all. (box)  </TEXT>

   Some people never throw anything
away, according to <PERSON>Scott Bruce</PERSON>, who came to this breakfast food
mecca looking for old cereal boxes to add to his collection.
   Sound flaky?
   ``Cereal boxes represent heroes of popular culture _ the grain
gods, I call them,'' said <PERSON>Bruce</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Cambridge</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION>, collector who
once started a lunch-box collecting craze.
   ``When a kid sits down with a bowl of his favorite cereal, he
becomes one with his hero. It's like a secular communion rite.''
   Bruce, 34, is talking this week with cereal company executives
as well as ordinary people who hoard cereal boxes, if there is such
a thing.
   Rare boxes can fetch up to <MONEY>$1,000</MONEY>, said <PERSON>Bruce</PERSON>, who began his
collection in <DATE>1988</DATE> and recently published a collector's magazine
called <ORGANIZATION>Flake</ORGANIZATION>.
   Battle Creek is the home of <ORGANIZATION>Kellogg Co.</ORGANIZATION>, the world's largest
cereal maker, as well as Post and <ORGANIZATION>Ralston-Purina</ORGANIZATION> plants.
   ``The people here have cereal in their bloodstream,'' said <PERSON>Bruce</PERSON>.
   Old cereal boxes are all the more valuable because of the
scarcity of people who allow them to hang around.
   ``The militant mom was the death to many collections,'' he said
mournfully. ``But maybe I'll find that that odd citizen who has a
Corn Flakes box with <PERSON>Vanessa Williams</PERSON>.'' Miss <ORGANIZATION>Williams</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Miss
America</LOCATION> <DATE>1984</DATE>, lost the crown when it was disclosed she had posed

   Some people never throw anything
away, according to <PERSON>Scott Bruce</PERSON>, who came to this breakfast food
mecca looking for old cereal boxes to add to his collection.
   Sound flaky?
   ``Cereal boxes represent heroes of popular culture _ the grain
gods, I call them,'' said <PERSON>Bruce</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Cambridge</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION>, collector who
once started a lunch-box collecting craze.
   ``When a kid sits down with a bowl of his favorite cereal, he
becomes one with his hero. It's like a secular communion rite.''
   Bruce, 34, is talking this week with cereal company executives
as well as ordinary people who hoard cereal boxes, if there is such
a thing.
   Rare boxes can fetch up to <MONEY>$1,000</MONEY>, said <PERSON>Bruce</PERSON>, who began his
collection in <DATE>1988</DATE> and recently published a collector's magazine
called <ORGANIZATION>Flake</ORGANIZATION>.
   Battle Creek is the home of <ORGANIZATION>Kellogg Co.</ORGANIZATION>, the world's largest
cereal maker, as well as Post and <ORGANIZATION>Ralston-Purina</ORGANIZATION> plants.
   ``The people here have cereal in their bloodstream,'' said <PERSON>Bruce</PERSON>.
   Old cereal boxes are all the more valuable because of the
scarcity of people who allow them to hang around.
   ``The militant mom was the death to many collections,'' he said
mournfully. ``But maybe I'll find that that odd citizen who has a
Corn Flakes box with <PERSON>Vanessa Williams</PERSON>.'' Miss <ORGANIZATION>Williams</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Miss
America</LOCATION> <DATE>1984</DATE>, lost the crown when it was disclosed she had posed
nude for Playboy.
   <PERSON>Bruce</PERSON> said he generally hunts for vintage boxes in good
condition from the <DATE>1930s</DATE> through <DATE>1970s</DATE>. But he's even squirreling

   A Canadian delivery of sleet and ice sledded into the deep South
on <DATE>Monday</DATE> in a winter preview that cracked century-old temperature
records across the <LOCATION>Midwest</LOCATION> and clogged the <LOCATION>Missouri River</LOCATION> with a
75-mile ice jam.
   The bitter weather closed schools from <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>,
and forecasters said no change was in sight. The cold is being
caused by a horseshoe-shaped flow of air that follows the <LOCATION>West
Coast</LOCATION> up to <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION>, chills out and plunges down through <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> into
the <LOCATION>East</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Midwest</LOCATION>.
   ``It's simply a pipeline that carries ... the cold air
southward,'' said <PERSON>Ed Ferguson</PERSON>, deputy director of the federal
government's <ORGANIZATION>Severe Storms Forecast Center</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Kansas City</LOCATION>. ``And by
southward, I mean all the way to the <LOCATION>Gulf of Mexico</LOCATION>.''
   Southerners from central <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION> to the <LOCATION>Carolinas</LOCATION> awoke
<DATE>Monday</DATE> to a <ORGANIZATION>Yankee</ORGANIZATION>'s vista of freezing rain and sleet that made
driving hazardous and was blamed for at least one traffic death.
Hundreds of schools were closed.
   The <ORGANIZATION>National Weather Service</ORGANIZATION> said as much as an inch of sleet
and freezing rain covered north and central <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION> before dawn,
and freezing rain extended as far south as <LOCATION>Savannah</LOCATION>.
   Ice on <LOCATION>Interstate 85</LOCATION> near <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> apparently contributed to a
crash that killed <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> Falcons tight end <PERSON>Brad Beckman</PERSON>,
authorities said.
   At least 19 deaths around the nation were blamed on the cold
during the weekend, including the deaths of two young <LOCATION>Tulsa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Okla.</LOCATION>,
girls who apparently were playing with a makeshift sled <DATE>Sunday</DATE> when
they plunged through thin ice on a lake. Two homeless people died
of hypothermia while sleeping in <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION> subway stations.
   One weekend hypothermia death in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> brought to 10 the
number of people who have died from exposure in the municipal area
so far this <DATE>winter</DATE>, said a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION>Cook County Medical
Examiner</ORGANIZATION>'s office.
   A school bus carrying 43 children crashed into a station wagon
on a slippery highway <DATE>Monday</DATE> near <LOCATION>Shapleighl</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION>, but none of
the children were seriously hurt, officials said.
   <DATE>Monday</DATE>'s cold broke <DATE>Dec. 18</DATE> records that had held for more than
a century in <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, where it was minus 7; in <LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION>,
where it also was 7 below, and in <LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION>, where it was minus 3.
   Other records included <LOCATION>Parkersburg</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>W.Va.</LOCATION>, at 4 above,
<LOCATION>Cincinnati</LOCATION> at 3 below, <LOCATION>Fort Wayne</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ind.</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION> at minus 5,
and <LOCATION>Youngstown</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, at minus 8.
   ``Good night, it's been unreal,'' said <PERSON>Pam Decker</PERSON>, co-owner of
<ORGANIZATION>Decker's Wrecker Service</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Boonville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ind.</LOCATION>, which was besieged
with calls about stalled and wrecked cars and the need to
jump-start dead or dying car batteries.
   The <LOCATION>Missouri River</LOCATION> turned to ice for about a 75-mile stretch
between <PERSON>Blair</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Neb.</LOCATION>, just north of <LOCATION>Omaha</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Sioux City</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>,
according to the <ORGANIZATION>National Weather Service</ORGANIZATION>.
   The ice jam had begun late <DATE>Friday</DATE> and grew over the <DATE>weekend</DATE>.
Officials feared that the ice floe could cause problems for
communities that pump their water from the river, and <ORGANIZATION>Weather
Service</ORGANIZATION> hydrologist <PERSON>Roy Osugi</PERSON> didn't hold out hope for an early
thaw.
   ``Nothing is going to bust it up except warmer weather,'' <PERSON>Osugi</PERSON>
said. ``We think it's going to stay in place at least <DATE>this week</DATE>
because it's going to stay very cold.''
   In <LOCATION>St. Joseph</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mo.</LOCATION>, officials activated a new emergency pump as
a precautionary measure to keep water flowing to the city.
   There were similar problems in the town of <LOCATION>Monroe</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mich.</LOCATION>, where
55,000 water customers were asked to conserve while workers <DATE>Monday</DATE>
cleared a frozen intake valve that also was clogged with <LOCATION>Lake Erie</LOCATION>
zebra mussels, a non-native species which has no natural predators
and is proliferating in the lake.
   In <LOCATION>Crooksville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, officials declared a water emergency after
a series of water main breaks over the weekend. Parts of the small
town had been without service for three days.
   The cold also was the likely cause of a break in a 4-inch pipe
that let water surge through all 12 floors of a new hospital at
<ORGANIZATION>Ohio State University</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>, causing at least <MONEY>$1 million</MONEY>
damage and delaying its scheduled <DATE>Jan. 16</DATE> opening, said <ORGANIZATION>OSU</ORGANIZATION> vice
president <PERSON>Richard Jackson</PERSON>.
   Farther west, the arctic weather system carried welcome snow to
<ORGANIZATION>Rocky Mountain</ORGANIZATION> ski resorts and wind chills of 35 below zero to
parts of <LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION>. It was 26 below at <LOCATION>Jordan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mont.</LOCATION>, and high
temperatures in some parts of <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> were expected to be below
zero.
   In <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION>, snowfall in the 24 hours that ended <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME>
included 4 inches at <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION>, 16 inches at <LOCATION>Vail</LOCATION> and 9\ inches at
<LOCATION>Steamboat Springs</LOCATION> _ which has gotten 99 inches in nine days, said
spokeswoman <PERSON>Barb Jennings</PERSON>.
   At <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Stapleton International Airport</LOCATION>, spokesman <PERSON>Norm
Avery</PERSON> said crews were out before daybreak, clearing 10 runways.
However, he said flights were delayed up to an hour because of the
snow.
   Ferguson, of the <ORGANIZATION>Severe Storms Forecast Center</ORGANIZATION>, said the outlook
for most of the country is for below-average temperatures for the
next month or so.
   ``There's no promise that we can see in any of our projections
that we're going to have balmy weather in the middle of <DATE>winter</DATE>,''
he said.

<HEAD>Commission Urges U.S. and Canada to Bar New Species</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An international commission urged the <LOCATION>United
States</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> on <DATE>Thursday</DATE> to bar new species of animals from the
<ORGANIZATION>Great Lakes</ORGANIZATION> in an effort to prevent additional harm to the region's
delicate ecology.
   ``The integrity of the Great Lakes ecosystem requires the
maintenance of a balanced yet dynamic natural system,'' the
<ORGANIZATION>International Joint Commission</ORGANIZATION>, a U.S.-Canadian agency, said in a
report on the lakes' environment.
   ``Introduced species can seriously affect the balance and
distribution of native species by altering the structure and
developmental patterns of their biological communities,'' it added.
   The report by the commission noted that there have been
continuing concerns about outside species in the lakes, the sea
lamprey and smelt in particular.
   However, in recent years, the number of alien species introduced
into the lakes has shown a significant increase.
   Among the outside species that now threaten the lakes' native
life forms are the alewife, the coho salmon, the Asiatic clam, the
zebra mussel and the river ruffe.
   The commission encouraged involvement by the coast guards of the
<LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> in controlling the problem, and recommended
that the nations ``take steps to prevent the further introduction,
particularly the unplanned introduction, of exotic life forms into
the Great Lakes ecosystem.''
   It was the first time the commission had made such a
recommendation, said <PERSON>Frank Bevacqua</PERSON> of the commission's <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>
office.
   Some of the outside species were introduced for sport fishing.
Others made their way into the lakes as hitchhikers on ships or
through extending their range from bodies of water outside the lakes
region.
   Although the new species are controlled by predators in their
original homes, many lack predators in the lakes, ``and given an
adequate food supply and appropriate life-support systems, ... they
can become a serious threat if they outcompete or destroy valuable
native species,'' the commission said.
   The report also warned of increasing concentrations of toxic
substances in <LOCATION>Great Lakes</LOCATION> animals, a reversal of declines recorded
in the <DATE>1970s</DATE>.
   Waterbirds on the lakes, however, were producing more offspring,
the commission said.
   ``Populations that were once declining have increased
substantially, and reproductive problems in fish-eating birds are
generally confined to specific sites,'' the report said.
``Similarly, increasing bald eagle nesting sites are being reported
in the basin.''
   The report gave no figures on increased toxic-substance
concentration or bird reproduction.

   <PERSON>Liz Taylor</PERSON>, <PERSON>Roberto Duran</PERSON> and a pack of
marauding mussels all came to <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> this past week, in one form
or another.
   If you thought your representatives spent all week on such
weighty matters as aid for <LOCATION>Eastern Europe</LOCATION> and the Clean Air bill,
think again.
   Most members of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> devote only a small portion of their
days to such pursuits. Just as many hours, and usually many more,
are spent on keeping constituents happy, getting one's picture or
name mentioned in the hometown or national press, attending
receptions, and lavishing praise on colleagues and witnesses.
   A typical two-hour congressional hearing, for example, will
devote 20 minutes or so to rituals of accolade. The Democratic
chairman of the committee praises a colleague for helping prepare
the session; the ranking Republican praises the chairman for
holding the hearing; the members praise the witness _ an
administration official or specialist of some sort _ for his or her
work on the subject, and so on.
   With some 250 committees and subcommittees in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>, the 100
<ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> members and their 435 colleagues in the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> are busy
people. Most sit on three or four committees, which is where most
congressional action is taken.
   Except during floor votes, the main chambers of the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> and
<ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> are virtually empty, with only a speaker on the podium and a
stray clerk or usher in the aisles.
   More often than not, lawmakers will stay away from a plenary
session to make time for a meeting with constituents visiting
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>. After all, these are the people who will get them
re-elected.
   On a recent day, Rep. <PERSON>Dave McCurdy</PERSON>'s schedule had 15 constituent
visits. Aides to the <LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION> Democrat say this is an unusally
heavy load, although not rare.
   McCurdy and his colleagues also have to travel to their home
districts periodically to meet with voters and tend to local
business. Last year, <PERSON>McCurdy</PERSON> flew home 11 times.
   No wonder, then, that much of the work on Capitol Hill gets
accomplished by staff members rather than by the lawmakers
themselves. Most members have a staff of about 20, although some _
especially if they chair influential committees _ have double that.
In all, <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> employs about 20,000 people _ including security
police, cleaners and clerks.
   While visits by foreign visitors _ presidents, prime ministers
and the like _ usually get bigger headlines, American celebrities
are often a much bigger draw at the Capitol itself.
   <PERSON>Elizabeth Taylor</PERSON> came to <LOCATION>Capitol Hill</LOCATION> to lobby for a bill that
would give <MONEY>$600 million</MONEY> to AIDS sufferers.
   Although <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> has been discussing the proposed bill for
weeks, <PERSON>Miss Taylor</PERSON>'s appearance at a hearing and a news conference
drew dozens of lawmakers eager to shake her hand or stare into her
famous violet eyes.
   ``It took <PERSON>Elizabeth Taylor</PERSON> to get you to one of my hearings,''
the panel's chairman, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON>Barbara Boxer</PERSON>, admonished her
Democratic colleague from <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Richard Durbin</PERSON>.
   <PERSON>Dante Fascell</PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>House Foreign Affairs Committee</ORGANIZATION>,
made time last week for boxer <PERSON>Roberto Duran</PERSON>. The former
welterweight champion came to <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> to seek aid for his native
<LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>, food for hungry children and housing for Panamanians left
homeless by the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> invasion last <DATE>December</DATE>.
   And then there were the marauding mollusks.
   Reporters on <LOCATION>Capitol Hill</LOCATION>, sifting through their mail boxes,
pulled out a plastic bag stuffed with mussel shells appended to a
press release.
   ``<PERSON>Sen. John Glenn</PERSON> and Rep. <PERSON>Henry Nowak</PERSON> today proposed a <MONEY>$40
million</MONEY> plan to control the zebra mussel, the small shellfish
attacking water intake pipes and creating environmental problems in
the Great Lakes,'' the release said.
   Glenn was joined at a news conference by seven lawmakers
battling the spread of the mollusks, which reached the Great Lakes
by stowing away on freighters from <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>.
   ``I can tell you it's no joke,'' <PERSON>Glenn</PERSON> said.

<DATELINE>
   THE QUAGGA is extinct
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
or at least it was, until a team of international scientists began trying to
resurrect this zebra-like creature, native to the arid vastness of <LOCATION>South
Africa</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Karoo</LOCATION>.
Coloured rich brown to blend in with the red dust of the <LOCATION>Karoo</LOCATION> - a huge,
infertile, sparsely populated area of the <LOCATION>Cape</LOCATION> - the quagga looked like a
zebra with less than half the normal stripes. Karoo farmers saw it as an
unwelcome competitor for grazing, and set out to exterminate it. The last
specimen died more than a hundred years ago in an <LOCATION>Amsterdam</LOCATION> zoo.
Now scientists believe they can bring back the quagga, named by the original
Hottentot inhabitants of the <LOCATION>Karoo</LOCATION> for the distinctive sound it made. At a
nature reserve 200 kilometres north-east of <LOCATION>Cape Town</LOCATION>, they have begun
selectively breeding plains zebras (the striped animals most familiar to
Europeans), hoping to restore the distinctive colouration of the quagga.
If they succeed, there is a chance that other long-dead animals could be
saved from extinction - but only if they are closely related to an extant
species which can be used as a breeding base. The dinosaur and the
brontosaurus will remain in oblivion; but scientists might, for example, be
able to recreate the extinct blue antelope.
In fact, the only hope for resurrecting the quagga is that it is not truly
'extinct'. Genetic research has shown that it was a sub-species of the
plains zebra; scientists believe its colouration may simply be diluted in
the extant population of such zebras, where isolated individuals (darker in
colour and faintly striped) already slightly resemble quaggas.
This resemblance is borne out by genetic evidence: DNA extracted from dried
tissue and blood of stuffed quaggas matches that of the plains Zebra,
proving that the quagga is a sub-species.
'If a species is gone, nothing can be done about it because the entire gene
pool is gone,' says <PERSON>Reinhold Rau</PERSON>, head of taxidermy at the South African
museum in <LOCATION>Cape Town</LOCATION>, and the father of the quagga project. But the gene pool
of the plains zebra is still available for re-breeding the quagga, by a
process similar to selective breeding of livestock.
Baby <PERSON>Reina</PERSON>, one of six foals who form the first generation of the quagga
breeding project, demonstrates how it is done. She was born of parents
specially selected in the wild for their faint striping, and her stripes are
fainter still. But scientists were not so lucky with the other foals: one
has distinctly more prominent stripes than either parent, and the others
show little progress toward quagga colouration. Scientists hope to see firm
results in 10 years - but it could take longer.
Some wildlife experts dispute the validity of the project: 'We can breed a
zebra which will look like a quagga but it will never, ever be a quagga. All
we know about the quagga was what it looked like and where it was found. We
know nothing about its behaviour, its habitat . . . ' says <PERSON>Zane Erasmus</PERSON>,
ranger at the <ORGANIZATION>Vrolijkheid Nature Reserve</ORGANIZATION> where the breeding is being done.
Scientists were not able to get a full genetic fingerprint of the quagga,
because none of the crucial 'nuclear DNA' survived in the stuffed specimens;
so they will never know whether a re-bred quagga is just a man-made
lookalike or a truly genetic recreation.
And after several generations in captivity the quagga may no longer be able
to survive in the wild. But if they can be released into <LOCATION>Karoo</LOCATION> nature
reserves, where there are no major predators, it would be a small step
towards rectifying the damage done by man to <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>'s wildlife.

<TEXT>
   A spiny-tailed little creature with a big
appetite, a water flea that may have hitched a ride from <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>
aboard Soviet freighters, is threatening to disrupt the food chain
in the <LOCATION>Great Lakes</LOCATION>, a federal scientist said <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
   Only a half-inch long, the predator called bythotrephes is a
variety of water flea with a long, spiny tail, said <PERSON>Henry A.
Vanderploeg</PERSON>, a scientist with the <ORGANIZATION>National Oceanic</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Atmospheric
Administration</ORGANIZATION>.
   What bythotrephes lacks in size, it makes up for in appetite.
<PERSON>Vanderploeg</PERSON> said his research showed one of the little creatures in
a day can clear 1{ quarts of water of the native water fleas that
provide food for newborn fish.
   ``For an animal this small, it represents a high rate of
clearance,'' <PERSON>Vanderploeg</PERSON> said at <ORGANIZATION>NOAA</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Great Lakes Environmental
Research Laboratory</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Ann Arbor</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mich</LOCATION>.
   The water fleas native to the Great Lakes provide food for
juvenile alewives, bloaters and perch, which in turn are food for
salmon, trout and other large predatory fish.
   Because of bythotrephes, in future years ``it is possible that,
for example, alewives, certain forage fish, could be less abundant,
and since these forage fish would be less abundant, salmon and
trout could also become less abundant,'' <PERSON>Vanderploeg</PERSON> said.
   However, a more precise forecast of the effect of the European
predator must await a better understanding of the Great Lakes food
chain, he said.
   Bythotrephes were first found in <LOCATION>Lake Huron</LOCATION> in <DATE>1984</DATE> and by <DATE>1986</DATE>
had spread to <LOCATION>Lake Erie</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Lake Ontario</LOCATION>. They are now found in all
the <LOCATION>Great Lakes</LOCATION>.
   The predators may have been brought from <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> in water ballast
aboard empty grain freighters from the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> and dumped into
the lakes, <ORGANIZATION>NOAA</ORGANIZATION> said.
   Bythotrephes are found in freshwater throughout northern <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>.
There, however, ``it is not disruptive to the food chain in the
sense that it has been there for a long time,'' <PERSON>Vanderploeg</PERSON> said.
``All the plankton and fish that have evolved there are used to
having it around.''
   Although the European predator can damage the Great Lakes food
supply for very young fish, ``at a certain stage in the life cycle
of a fish, bythotrephes would then become food for that fish,''
<PERSON>Vanderploeg</PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
   President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> on <DATE>Thursday</DATE> signed a <MONEY>$2.5
billion</MONEY> bill authorizing new water projects for flood control,
storm damage reduction, inland navigation and port development.
   ``In addition to authorizing worthwhile water resources
projects, the legislation includes a number of provisions that
protect and restore this nation's environment, which I
wholeheartedly support,'' <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> said in a statement.
   Even so, <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> said, the legislation ``contains a number of
special-interest provisions'' in some of the projects.
   He said these included developing recreation facilities, levee
beautification, agricultural land improvements and, in one
instance, replacing a bridge.
   ``Because I believe in a strong water resources program, and
despite my concerns about a number of inappropriate provisions, I
have approved this bill,'' <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> said.
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> also signed legislation designed to protect coastal inland
waters from the zebra mussel and other so-called ``nuisance
species''
   It contains provisions for wetlands restoration and protection,
especially in <LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION>, and fish and wildlife conservation in the
<LOCATION>Great Lakes</LOCATION>.

A federal court jury in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> was asked to decide <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> whether a 
South African safari tour leader illegally imported nine skins from a rare and 
threatened species of zebra and tried to peddle them in <LOCATION>Orange County</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecution contends that <PERSON>Wallace Charles Venter</PERSON>, 37, knew it was illegal 
to sell the <PERSON>Hartmann</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>Mountain Zebra</ORGANIZATION> skins in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and had 
written a letter to the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Fish</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Wildlife Service</ORGANIZATION> saying that the skins 
were not intended for sale. 
</P>
<P>
But in <DATE>August</DATE> and <DATE>September</DATE>, <PERSON>Venter</PERSON> placed two classified ads in the <ORGANIZATION>Orange 
County Register</ORGANIZATION> offering to sell zebra hides for up to <MONEY>$1,900</MONEY>, according to 
documents prepared by the prosecution. An anonymous reader called <ORGANIZATION>Fish &amp; 
Wildlife</ORGANIZATION> to complain, and <PERSON>Venter</PERSON> was arrested in <DATE>September</DATE> after he allegedly 
sold one of the skins to an undercover agent.

<P>
Venter's attorney, <PERSON>Morton H. Boren</PERSON>, said <PERSON>Venter</PERSON> leads safari tours in <LOCATION>South 
Africa</LOCATION> and came to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> "to see if he could drum up business." 
<PERSON>Boren</PERSON> said <PERSON>Venter</PERSON> did not sell the skin but was merely using it as collateral 
while he arranged the sale of other, legally imported skins. Venter thought 
that transaction was perfectly legal, <PERSON>Boren</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
"The law is really confused," <PERSON>Boren</PERSON> said. "He honestly believed it was OK for 
him to use one or two of these skins for collateral. . . . If he was going to 
sell these skins illegally, he would just sell them and split." 
</P>
<P>
Venter is charged with importing nine skins for sale, selling one skin, and 
making a false statement to a government official, <PERSON>Boren</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> government considers the <PERSON>Hartmann</PERSON>'s Mountain Zebra a "threatened" 
species, which means that it is likely to become an endangered species within 
the foreseeable future. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the common black-and-white zebra, the <PERSON>Hartmann</PERSON>'s zebra is brown and buff 
colored and has an unusual pattern of cross-bar stripes. At last count in <DATE>1985</DATE>, 
there were only 7,000 of the animals left in <LOCATION>Southwest Africa</LOCATION> and neighboring 
<LOCATION>Angola</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Boren</PERSON> said <PERSON>Venter</PERSON>'s zebra hides were taken with the approval of South African 
authorities as part of a drought cull. 
</P>
<P>
"The herd was too big for the water supply, so they captured and destroyed 40 
to 60 of them," <PERSON>Boren</PERSON> said. The skins were sold to a tannery, which sold them 
to a friend of <PERSON>Venter</PERSON>'s, who asked <PERSON>Venter</PERSON> to bring them to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
"And he thought, 'Well, if Americans can buy them there, when I'm in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> 
why don't I see about taking orders for them in <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>, with all the 
(proper) documents,' " <PERSON>Boren</PERSON> explained. 
</P>
<P>
Federal law forbids importing threatened species for commercial activities, 
including their sale, but it does allow tourists to bring the skins home for 
their own personal and non-commercial use. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Atty. <PERSON>John S. Wiley Jr.</PERSON> would not comment on the case as the 
jury was deliberating <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
But according to the prosecution's memorandum, <PERSON>Venter</PERSON> had begun trying to sell 
the skins even before they were brought to <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> on <DATE>Aug. 29</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Dressed in his safari suit and speaking with a noticeable accent, <PERSON>Venter</PERSON> 
visited a Fish and <ORGANIZATION>Wildlife Service</ORGANIZATION> office and picked up information about 
wildlife-import regulations, and placed several calls to the department on <DATE>Aug</DATE>. 
1, the memo said. 
</P>
<P>
The first newspaper ad, which began appearing on <DATE>Aug. 26</DATE>, said, "African Games 
Skins, zebra, <ORGANIZATION>Springbok Etc.</ORGANIZATION> <MONEY>$50</MONEY>," followed by a Long Beach-area telephone 
number. The second ad offered "Zebra skins, <MONEY>$1,900</MONEY>," the memo said. 
</P>
<P>
On about <DATE>Aug. 30</DATE>, a 27-year-old Yorba <PERSON>Linda</PERSON> man called <PERSON>Venter</PERSON> and asked about 
buying the skins. 
</P>
<P>
"He had a real heavy accent, South African," said <PERSON>Donald K. Augustine</PERSON>, who was 
called to testify at the trial. "We joked about the problems over in <LOCATION>South 
Africa</LOCATION>. He was a nice man, he really was, considering . . . " 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Augustine</PERSON> said that <PERSON>Venter</PERSON> promised to bring the skins to his office in Orange 
for examination. <PERSON>Augustine</PERSON> said he had friends who had brought zebra skins back 
from safaris and had no idea that the skins <PERSON>Venter</PERSON> was selling belonged to a 
threatened species. 
</P>
<P>
"He had to know it was illegal," <PERSON>Augustine</PERSON> said in an interview <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked him, 'Is this legal?' and he said 'Yeah.' I said, 'You've got 
permission?' He said, 'Yeah.' " 
</P>
<P>
But <PERSON>Venter</PERSON> never showed up for the appointment and <PERSON>Augustine</PERSON> dropped the matter 
until federal prosecutors found his telephone number among <PERSON>Venter</PERSON>'s papers and 
called him to testify. 
</P>
<P>
When the skins arrived in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, a customs inspector thought the shipment 
was unusual and asked for a notarized affidavit from <PERSON>Venter</PERSON> that they were for 
personal and not commercial use, the memo said. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Venter</PERSON> did write a letter saying that the skins were purchased by a man named 
<PERSON>Sidowski</PERSON>, and that five would be used to decorate <ORGANIZATION>Sidowski</ORGANIZATION>'s house and the 
other four would be used by <PERSON>Venter</PERSON> as a backdrop for photographs to promote his 
safari business, the prosecution's memo said. 
</P>
<P>
The letter added, "There is no intention of selling them." 
</P>
<P>
When customs officials opened the crate, they found the zebra skins as well as 
a stuffed Nile crocodile, which is an endangered species that is not permitted 
in this country under any circumstances, the memo said. 
</P>
<P>
The crocodile was seized, but prosecutors could not locate <PERSON>Sidowski</PERSON> and are not 
sure whether such a person exists, the memo said. 
</P>
<P>
The zebra skins were shown to the jury and introduced into evidence. In his 
closing statement, <PERSON>Boren</PERSON> said that the jury should not be swayed by their 
emotions toward killing wildlife, but should focus strictly on the legal issues 
involved. The case is being heard by <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> District Court <PERSON>Judge William D. 
Keller</PERSON>.

<HEAD>Erie's Cleaner Now, No Fires in Almost 20 Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOROTHY GAST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CLEVELAND (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly 20 years after the <LOCATION>Cuyahoga River</LOCATION> last
caught fire, officials say <LOCATION>Lake Erie</LOCATION> and its tributaries are
cleaner than they have been in decades.
   Scores of <LOCATION>Lake Erie</LOCATION> beaches will be open in <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> this year, and
more than 25 million walleye thrive in <ORGANIZATION>Erie</ORGANIZATION>'s waters. Boating has
become so popular that many marinas in the <LOCATION>Toledo</LOCATION> area are running
out of dock space.
   A few decades ago, <LOCATION>Lake Erie</LOCATION> had only three clean beaches, and
fish were dying at a rapid rate. An oil slick on the Cuyahoga
caught fire <DATE>June 22, 1969</DATE>.
   The dramatic improvement has been caused primarily by a decrease
in phosphates and other nutrients that caused algae to flourish in
<LOCATION>Lake Erie</LOCATION>, using up oxygen and killing fish, said <PERSON>Laura Fay</PERSON>, a
research associate for the Center for <ORGANIZATION>Lake Erie Area Research</ORGANIZATION>.
   Phosphate pollution levels were decreased largely through
improvement of sewage treatment plants, she said.
   Half the people living in the <LOCATION>Great Lakes</LOCATION> basin live near <LOCATION>Lake
Erie</LOCATION>, including residents of <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Toledo</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Erie</ORGANIZATION>,
<LOCATION>Pa</LOCATION>. Eleven million people use <LOCATION>Lake Erie</LOCATION> for their drinking water,
<PERSON>Ms. Fay</PERSON> said.
   Although fish now appear to be thriving in the shallowest of the
<LOCATION>Great Lakes</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Ms. Fay</PERSON> said the bottom of <LOCATION>Lake Erie</LOCATION> and its
tributaries has sediments contaminated with such materials as
mercury and cancer-causing PCBs.
   Funding for research and cleanup on the <LOCATION>Great Lakes</LOCATION> has been
decreasing, she said, even though contaminated sediments are a more
chronic problem than phosphates.
   ``I hate to see people sit back and rest on their laurels,'' <PERSON>Ms.
Fay</PERSON> said. ``We've really come a long way, but the toxic problem is
something we really can't see. Some of the effects are really going
to be subtle. We might have lower reproductive efficiency of
walleye or darter, but we're not going to see that for a while.''
   The <LOCATION>Cuyahoga River</LOCATION>, which has ignited three times since <DATE>1936</DATE>,
remains an area of concern, along with several other <LOCATION>Lake Erie</LOCATION>
shipping channels, because of the pollutants that have settled on
the bottom.
   The <ORGANIZATION>International Joint Commission on Great Lakes Water Quality</ORGANIZATION>,
in a <DATE>1987</DATE> report, said sediments in the <LOCATION>Cuyahoga</LOCATION> are tainted with
PCBs, ammonia, cyanide and lead.
   Because of the contaminants, the <ORGANIZATION>Ohio Department of Health</ORGANIZATION>
advises people not to eat catfish caught in the channel and carp
caught in the open waters of <LOCATION>Lake Erie</LOCATION>, said <PERSON>Deborah Gray</PERSON>, a
toxicologist in the <ORGANIZATION>Division of Epidemiology</ORGANIZATION>.
   Catfish and carp feed on the bottom of <LOCATION>Lake Erie</LOCATION>, she said, and
tests have shown that nearly half have <ORGANIZATION>PCB</ORGANIZATION> concentrations that
exceed levels recommended by the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Food and Drug Administration</ORGANIZATION>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Health Department</ORGANIZATION> also has issued an advisory for all fish
caught in the <LOCATION>Black River</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Lorain</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Ashtabula River</LOCATION> in
<LOCATION>Ashtabula</LOCATION>, which empty into <LOCATION>Lake Erie</LOCATION>. There is no advisory for the
<LOCATION>Cuyahoga</LOCATION>.
   ``An advisory is just that _ an advisory,'' she said. ``We're
talking about a very small incremental risk to someone who would
eat this fish. But what we're saying is that there are still fish
exceeding the <ORGANIZATION>FDA</ORGANIZATION> limit and we think people should know about
this.''
   But shallow <LOCATION>Lake Erie</LOCATION> is cleaner than many of the <LOCATION>Great Lakes</LOCATION>,
largely because it is is able to flush itself every 2.6 years,
officials said. The flush time for some of the upper lakes, which
are 1,000 feet deep, is more than a century. <PERSON>Ms. Fay</PERSON> said <LOCATION>Lake Erie</LOCATION>
also has more organic substances that bind up toxic materials.
   <PERSON>Bob Wysenski</PERSON>, environmental scientist for the <ORGANIZATION>Ohio Environmental
Protection Agency</ORGANIZATION>, said <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>'s beaches generally are safer for
swimming now than at any time in the past decade.
   He cited water quality statistics at 20 <LOCATION>Lake Erie</LOCATION> beaches that
show a general downward trend in fecal coliform, a bacteria that
can cause flu-like symptoms or ear and eye infections.
   There have been no documented cases of severe illnesses caused
by swimming in <LOCATION>Lake Erie</LOCATION> in the past decade, he said.

FT  19 SEP 92 / Travel: A safari that ends on the beach - Richard Gilbert
divides his Kenyan holiday between the luxurious game lodges of Tsavo and
the Indian Ocean
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GILBERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DELICATELY laundered white mosquito net around my bed made the room look
like a bridal suite. I ordered a beer. As I quenched a thirst brought on by
a morning game drive in the bush, I glanced through the window and counted
eight zebra, five water-buck and nine elephants heading towards a
water-hole. It was early <DATE>February</DATE> in <LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Tsavo</LOCATION> national park and the
temperature had not dropped below 93'c Fahrenheit all day.
<LOCATION>Tsavo</LOCATION>, halfway between <LOCATION>Mombasa</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Nairobi</LOCATION>, is the largest game sanctuary in
<LOCATION>East Africa</LOCATION>. Thirty-six hours earlier we had struggled through fog to
<LOCATION>Gatwick</LOCATION>; now we were outbidding each other with sightings of exotic animals.
This was my first two-centre holiday - a week divided between the comforts
of an <ORGANIZATION>Indian Ocean</ORGANIZATION> beach hotel outside <LOCATION>Mombasa</LOCATION> and game rides into the bush
of <LOCATION>Tsavo</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Taita Hills</LOCATION> private game sanctuary.
Seven of us climbed on to a safari mini-bus for a game drive to <ORGANIZATION>Salt Lick
Lodge</ORGANIZATION>, a sanctuary in the <LOCATION>Taita Hills</LOCATION> that was once a sisal plantation. The
success of any game drive depends largely on the skills, prescience and
character of the driver-guide. With Hamid, we were lucky.
Off the Mombasa-Nairobi highway, Hamid turned the zebra- striped <ORGANIZATION>Nissan</ORGANIZATION> down
red dirt tracks surrounded by thorn scrub and short grass. He could
interpret the significance of a lump of animal dung or a patch of
smoothed-down grass with tremendous skill. Following trails and tracks, we
saw giraffes, gazelles, zebra, dikdik and exotic birds that would have
driven twitchers into a frenzy.
The game park lodges for overnight accommodation are a misnomer, having less
to do with <PERSON>Karen Blixen</PERSON> than with <ORGANIZATION>Conrad Hilton</ORGANIZATION>. Indeed, <ORGANIZATION>Salt Lick Safari
Lodge</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Taita Hills</LOCATION> is owned by <ORGANIZATION>Hilton</ORGANIZATION>. Built around a natural salt lick,
the clusters of rooms are on pillars to let the animals wander freely
underneath the lodge.
At dawn we set off north for <LOCATION>Tsavo</LOCATION>, once notorious for man-eating lions and
more recently for the Somali poachers who have plundered the black rhino
population.
Just when you think the views are unsurpassable, you reach Voi Lodge in
<LOCATION>Tsavo East</LOCATION>. Built on an escarpment, the lodge overlooks a remarkable series
of linked water holes. From my room I watched the gigantic amphitheatre fill
with dozens of elephants, their hides rusted from rolling in the red earth
around the water holes.
Waking at first light the following day, I disentangled myself from the
mosquito net and watched the continuing parade of wildlife, headed this time
by water buffalo and ostriches. The morning was still cool; the scent of
wild flowers filled the lodge.
The last lap of the safari took us to <LOCATION>Tsavo West</LOCATION> national park, with a
detour past <LOCATION>Mzima Springs</LOCATION> from where millions of gallons of crystal water
are piped daily to <LOCATION>Mombasa</LOCATION>. This oasis, surrounded by a valley of arid lava,
is a haven for hippos.
On the rough track to <ORGANIZATION>Ngulia Lodge</ORGANIZATION>, an inspired diversion by <PERSON>Hamid</PERSON> took us
to a pride of lions in a broad patch of long grass. Two new-born cubs romped
with elder members of the family; then, seeking a feed, they were gently
cuffed away by a lioness.
Ngulia Lodge, in <LOCATION>Tsavo West</LOCATION>, is a mecca for migrating birds. The lights of
the isolated lodge attract hundreds of species, and there is a roll-call of
rare visitors. Madagascar bee-eaters, penduline tits, hammerkops, wheatears,
warblers and waders are all regulars, together with a species bearing the
memorable name of 'red-cheeked cordon bleu'.
Four days of safari are rewarded with a long weekend of relaxation at <ORGANIZATION>Safari
Beach</ORGANIZATION> hotel outside <LOCATION>Mombasa</LOCATION>. How safe is a safari holiday?
The sudden spate of attacks on tourists in the <PERSON>Masai Mara</PERSON>, east of <LOCATION>Tsavo</LOCATION>,
earlier this year was unprecedented for <LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION> and led to increased security.
Operators are insisting on a minimum of two vehicles travelling together on
particular game drives in the Mara's remoter areas. But travellers to <LOCATION>Tsavo</LOCATION>
 -unlike the <ORGANIZATION>Mara</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Tsavo</LOCATION> is controlled by the <ORGANIZATION>Kenya Wildlife Service</ORGANIZATION> - have
faced no difficulties. <LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION> is still safer than <LOCATION>Key West</LOCATION>.
<PERSON>Richard Gilbert</PERSON> travelled with <LOCATION>Portland</LOCATION> Holidays, whose 'Portrait of <LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION>'
combined safari and beach holidays start at Pounds 689 per person for a week
(from <DATE>November 1</DATE>). The cost for 10 nights' beach plus four days' safari is
around Pounds 823 per person (again, from Nov 1). Address: 218 <ORGANIZATION>Great
Portland St</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> W1N SHG, tel: 071-388-5111, or 1 <LOCATION>Portland</LOCATION> St, Manchester
M1 3BJ, tel: 061-228-1188.

   The Canadian government proposed measures to reduce high Great Lakes water levels that are causing heavy damage to shoreline property in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>. 

   The proposals include removal of landfill in the <LOCATION>Niagara River</LOCATION>, which links <LOCATION>Lake Erie</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Lake Ontario</LOCATION>. 
Environment Minister <PERSON>Tom McMillan</PERSON> also proposed an increased flow of water from <LOCATION>Lake Erie</LOCATION> through the <ORGANIZATION>Black Rock Canal</ORGANIZATION>, which runs along the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> shore of the upper <LOCATION>Niagara River</LOCATION>. 

   The minister said the Canadian government "is committed to doing everything in its power to combat the problem of high water levels on the Great Lakes." 
Even with normal precipitation, he warned that "dangerously high levels will persist on <LOCATION>Lakes Michigan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Huron</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>St. Clair</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Erie</ORGANIZATION> for at least another two to three years." 
Lake <ORGANIZATION>St. Clair</ORGANIZATION> is between <LOCATION>Lake Huron</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Lake Erie</LOCATION>. 

   In the past 150 years, landfill by private property owners has blocked as much as <PERCENT>40%</PERCENT> of the <LOCATION>Niagara River</LOCATION> bed in some locations, restricting water flow into <LOCATION>Lake Ontario</LOCATION>. 
<PERSON>Mr. McMillan</PERSON>'s landfill-removal proposal requires the consent of <LOCATION>Ontario</LOCATION>'s provincial government. 

   In <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION> official said the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> hasn't received <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>'s proposal to increase the water flow through the <ORGANIZATION>Black Rock Canal</ORGANIZATION>. 
<PERSON>Mr. McMillan</PERSON> said the flow could be increased by 1,200 cubic feet a second, an increase of less than <PERCENT>1%</PERCENT> of the total average water flow between <LOCATION>Lake Erie</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Lake Ontario</LOCATION>. 

   The <ORGANIZATION>International Joint Commission</ORGANIZATION>, a U.S.-Canadian agency, also is expected to recommend later this year various measures to relieve the high-water problem, which has caused <MONEY>several hundred million dollars</MONEY> worth of damage in recent years. 

   <PERSON>Mr. McMillan</PERSON> indicated that the commission may recommend, among other things, an increased diversion of water out of <LOCATION>Lake Michigan</LOCATION> at <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>. 
The diversion, which moves Great Lakes water to the <LOCATION>Mississippi River</LOCATION> system, is currently limited by a <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> order to 3,200 cubic feet a second. 
Rep. <PERSON>Jim Sensenbrenner</PERSON> (R., <LOCATION>Wis.</LOCATION>) has introduced legislation that would allow the <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> water diversion to be increased to 10,000 cubic feet a second. 

   Lakeshore property owners also have been campaigning for a halt to a Canadian diversion of about 5,600 cubic feet a second of water into Lake Superior from hydroelectric dams in <LOCATION>Ontario</LOCATION>, but the provincial government has opposed changing those flows. 
<PERSON>Mr. McMillan</PERSON> asked the <LOCATION>Ontario</LOCATION> government to reconsider its position so that <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> will be able to respond immediately to any recommendations by the <ORGANIZATION>International Joint Commission</ORGANIZATION>. 

   <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and Canadian hydrologists, meanwhile, said that changes in existing water diversions will have only a small impact on water levels.

   A toxic chemical spill snaking its way
toward <LOCATION>Lake Erie</LOCATION> on <DATE>Thursday</DATE> forced the evacuation of hundreds of
people and fouled drinking water for at least 22,000 along the
<LOCATION>Sandusky River</LOCATION>.
   At least three people were treated for injuries after an
estimated 100,000 gallons of toluene, an octane enhancer, spilled
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE> from a ruptured <ORGANIZATION>Sun Co.</ORGANIZATION> pipeline south of here.
   Five hundred people, including 300 residents of <LOCATION>Old Fort</LOCATION>, 10
miles to the south, were evacuated <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> and <DATE>Thursday</DATE> because
of the fumes.
   ``It could get worse,'' said <LOCATION>Sandusky County</LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON>Dave
Gangwer</PERSON>. ``It depends on how slow it moves, and it's slowing down
rapidly.''
   The spill reached <LOCATION>Fremont</LOCATION> late <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, and the city stopped
pumping water from the river, officials said. They estimated a
14-mile section of the river was contaminated; the river was
flowing at about 1 mph.
   Officials fear the spill killed up to 1,000 fish, many of them
under ice, in <LOCATION>Sugar Creek</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Sandusky River</LOCATION>, and could affect
waterfowl, said <PERSON>Mike Taylor</PERSON>, a wildlife officer for the <ORGANIZATION>Ohio
Department of Natural Resources</ORGANIZATION>.
   Gov. <PERSON>Richard Celeste</PERSON> declared a state of emergency for <LOCATION>Sandusky
County</LOCATION>, which includes <LOCATION>Fremont</LOCATION>. The declaration makes state
assistance available.
   About 4 million gallons of water, one day's normal supply, was
put in reserve tanks before the spill arrived, said <PERSON>Gary
Rathfelder</PERSON>, assistant superintendent of <LOCATION>Fremont</LOCATION>'s water plant.
   Toluene is a flammable chemical that can produce irritating or
poisonous gases, according to an emergency response guidebook
published by the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Department of Transportation</ORGANIZATION>.
   The spill was detected around <TIME>6 p.m.</TIME> <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> after Sun workers
noticed that pressure had dropped in the pipeline, which carries
the chemical from a Sun oil refinery in <LOCATION>Toledo</LOCATION> to a refinery in
Marcus Hook, <LOCATION>Pa</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Sonya Elam</PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION>Ohio Disaster Services Agency</ORGANIZATION>,
said the chemical spilled in a swampy area in <LOCATION>Seneca County</LOCATION>, south
of <LOCATION>Fremont</LOCATION>, population 22,000, and then leaked into <ORGANIZATION>Sugar Creek</ORGANIZATION>, a
tributary of the <LOCATION>Sandusky River</LOCATION>. The <LOCATION>Sandusky River</LOCATION> flows north
into <LOCATION>Lake Erie</LOCATION>, 10 miles north of here.
   <PERSON>Ms. Elam</PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION>Ohio Environmental Protection Agency</ORGANIZATION> workers were
building a road into the swampy area and setting up a dike to
contain the chemical.
   <PERSON>Bob Arnet</PERSON>, an environmental safety coordinator for the <LOCATION>Tulsa</LOCATION>,
Okla.-based Sun Pipe Line, said authorities had not located the
leak.
   ``It's been shut off, but it's still leaking,'' <PERSON>Arnet</PERSON> said.
   Neither <ORGANIZATION>EPA</ORGANIZATION> nor Sun officials could estimate how much of the
chemical had entered the <LOCATION>Sandusky River</LOCATION>.
   Two emergency workers were treated at <ORGANIZATION>Tiffin Mercy Hospital</ORGANIZATION>
after they fell through ice and into contaminated water, while a
volunteer firefighter was treated after inhaling the fumes. All
were subsequently released.
   <PERSON>Bud Davis</PERSON>, a corporate spokesman for Sun, said the company would
take ``liability and responsibility for the leak.''
   <PERSON>Jack Fox</PERSON>, operations manager for <ORGANIZATION>Sun Pipe Line</ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION>Sun Co.</ORGANIZATION>
subsidiary, said the source of the leak was an 18-inch split in the
pipeline, which is buried 3{ feet deep and carries the chemical
from <LOCATION>northwest Ohio</LOCATION> to a refinery in Marcus Hook, <LOCATION>Pa</LOCATION>.
   The cleanup could cost as much as <MONEY>$1 million</MONEY> and last three to
four months, <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> said.
   <ORGANIZATION>EPA</ORGANIZATION> officials said they believed much of the chemical would
dissipate by the time it reaches <LOCATION>Lake Erie</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Don Higgins</PERSON>, environmental coordinator for the <ORGANIZATION>Ohio EPA</ORGANIZATION>, said he
did not expect lasting environmental problems, but added, ``I
expect quite a bit of environmental impact on Sugar Creek.''
   ``It's not the kind of stuff you want in a river,'' he said.
``It won't kill you, but you don't want to be around it for too
long.''

ZEBRA SKINS IMPORTER GUILTY OF GIVING FALSE STATEMENT; 
</P>
<P>
TRIAL: A FEDERAL JURY ACQUITTED A SOUTH AFRICAN NATIONAL ACCUSED OF ILLEGALLY 
IMPORTING AND SELLING NINE PELTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A South African national accused of illegally importing nine skins from a 
threatened species of zebra with the intent to unlawfully peddle them in <LOCATION>Orange 
County</LOCATION> was acquitted by a federal court jury <DATE>Thursday</DATE> of importing and selling 
the skins, but found guilty of making a false statement to a government 
official. 
</P>
<P>
Although the prosecution presented evidence that <PERSON>Wallace Charles Venter</PERSON>, 37, 
allegedly sold one of the skins to an undercover agent of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Fish and 
<ORGANIZATION>Wildlife Service</ORGANIZATION>, the jury was not convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that 
<PERSON>Venter</PERSON> "sold a threatened species knowing that it was illegal to do so," said 
Assistant <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Atty. <PERSON>John S. Wiley Jr</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
"He (<PERSON>Venter</PERSON>) said that there was no intention of selling (the skins) and that 
they would remain at a friend's house," said <PERSON>Wiley</PERSON>, who tried the case in <ORGANIZATION>U.S. 
District Court</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Venter</PERSON>'s intentions were at issue in the case because while it is illegal under 
federal law to import a threatened species for commercial use, import is 
permitted for personal and non-commercial use. "The jury apparently believed 
the defendant's claim that he really didn't know (the sale) was illegal," <PERSON>Wiley</PERSON> 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecution charged that <PERSON>Venter</PERSON> placed two classified ads in the <ORGANIZATION>Orange 
County Register</ORGANIZATION> offering to sell hides of the threatened <PERSON>Hartmann</PERSON>'s Mountain 
Zebra for up to <MONEY>$1,900</MONEY>. <PERSON>Venter</PERSON> was arrested in <DATE>September</DATE> after he allegedly 
sold one of the skins to the undercover agent. 
</P>
<P>
Venter's attorney, <PERSON>Morton H. Boren</PERSON>, could not be reached for comment <DATE>Thursday</DATE>. 
He contended in an interview <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> that <PERSON>Venter</PERSON>, who leads safari tours in 
<LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>, did not sell the skin but was merely using it as collateral while 
he arranged the sale of other, legally imported skins. Venter thought that 
transaction was legal, <PERSON>Boren</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
But the jury was convinced that <PERSON>Venter</PERSON> knew what he was doing when he sent a 
notarized letter to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Fish and <ORGANIZATION>Wildlife Service</ORGANIZATION> saying that the skins 
had been purchased overseas by a man named <PERSON>Richard Sidowski</PERSON>, <PERSON>Wiley</PERSON> said. 
Prosecutors could not locate Sidowski for verification. 
</P>
<P>
"The Fish and <ORGANIZATION>Wildlife Service</ORGANIZATION> inquired as to what the skins were really going 
to be used for," <PERSON>Wiley</PERSON> said. "They needed a letter of explanation, and the 
defendant wrote and signed and notarized a letter saying he had no intention of 
selling the skins and that the skins would go to the house of <PERSON>Mr. Sidowski</PERSON>. The 
jury found that to be a false statement." 
</P>
<P>
Venter faces up to five years in prison, up to a <MONEY>$10,000</MONEY> fine, or both, for 
making the false statement, <PERSON>Wiley</PERSON> said. <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> District Court <PERSON>Judge William D. 
Keller</PERSON> set bail at <MONEY>$25,000</MONEY> pending sentencing, but he could order <PERSON>Venter</PERSON> held 
in custody if he determines that <PERSON>Venter</PERSON> might flee the country. A sentencing 
date was not immediately set.

TRAVEL VIDEOS: FROM AFRICAN PLAINS TO THE JUNGLE OF COSTA RICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTY MARTIN, Martin is a former staff member of the Travel Section. Her 
column on travel videos appears monthly. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This month we'll study a couple of new -- and excellent -- videos, one dealing 
with <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>, the other with <LOCATION>Costa Rica</LOCATION>. And while both deal with wildlife 
conservation, the <LOCATION>Costa Rica</LOCATION> video involves other subjects as well. 
</P>
<P>
"Africa" (two videos), <LOCATION>Eco Ventures</LOCATION>, 45 minutes each (<DATE>1988</DATE>). These two 
remarkable videos, produced by <PERSON>Megan Epler</PERSON> Wood and narrated by <PERSON>George 
Plimpton</PERSON>, will be of special interest to African safari planners and 
ecology-minded armchair travelers. Each video combines spectacular scenery with 
a detailed study of the animals found in parks along the Tanzania-Kenya border. 
</P>
<P>
The first tape opens with stunning views of the vast, 10,000-square-mile 
Serengeti Plain and a map showing the path of migration that the hundreds of 
thousands of zebra, wildebeest and gazelles make on their annual search for 
grasslands and water. According to the narration, it's an ecological cycle that 
has continued for 10 million years. 
</P>
<P>
The camera follows the trek and shows how the animals surmount the incredible 
hardships of their long journey, including the constant threat of predators -- 
hyenas, wild dogs and lions. 
</P>
<P>
You get contrasting, touching scenes of the family-oriented zebra grooming each 
other and the birth of a soon-doomed wildebeest. 
</P>
<P>
The sound and sight of the thundering herd as it struggles across the swiftly 
flowing <LOCATION>Mara River</LOCATION> are a video highlight that <PERSON>Plimpton</PERSON> calls "one of the 
greatest wildlife spectacles on earth." 
</P>
<P>
Later, <ORGANIZATION>Wood</ORGANIZATION> captures some poignant and amusing scenes of the six-ton elephants 
splashing and playing as they cool off in the mud holes of <ORGANIZATION>Amboseli National 
Park</ORGANIZATION> at the foot of <LOCATION>Mt. Kilimanjaro</LOCATION>. Elephant teen-agers are shown 
trunk-wrestling, and at an elephant family gathering, viewers watch seniors 
embracing each other as if greeting old friends. Other animals shown in the 
park include flamingoes, cape buffalo, wart hogs and ostriches. 
</P>
<P>
The video concludes with a discussion between <PERSON>Plimpton</PERSON> and <PERSON>Russell Train</PERSON>, 
chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>World Wildlife Fund/The Conservation Foundation</ORGANIZATION>, on the threat 
from poachers to this one-great concentration of elephants. 
</P>
<P>
The second tape opens with film clips of an Osa and <PERSON>Martin Johnson</PERSON> safari of 
the <DATE>1920s</DATE>, then concentrates on following the social structure and daily life 
of a pride of lions. 
</P>
<P>
Viewers follow the female as she stalks her prey, while the male spends his day 
lying around surveying his realm, and the cubs wrestle and explore. The pride 
survives in spite of the fact that, according to <PERSON>Plimpton</PERSON>, the female is a poor 
huntress, missing five out of six tries. There also are brief scenes of some of 
the other cats in the <ORGANIZATION>Masai Mara Game Reserve</ORGANIZATION>, including leopards and cheetahs. 
</P>
<P>
Later, producer Wood opens with early film from the movie "<LOCATION>King Kong</LOCATION>," 
comparing it with the gentle mountain gorillas found in the <LOCATION>Virunga Mountains 
of Rwanda</LOCATION>, where the late anthropologist <PERSON>Dian Fossey</PERSON> lived and died studying 
them. 
</P>
<P>
The gorillas, which usually live at an altitude of 8,000 to 10,000 feet, don't 
survive in captivity. Viewers will see the females flirting with the males, and 
the majestic silverback males protecting their territory. 
</P>
<P>
Mountain gorillas are vegetarians, and scenes show them munching on the 
greenery and lolling in the sun, a favorite activity, while young ones stumble 
and frolic as they leave their mother to explore. 
</P>
<P>
Plimpton and Train conclude this segment with a discussion on preserving the 
mountain gorilla and the part that tourism plays in making the world aware of 
the nened for conservation. 
</P>
<P>
The tapes are available from Eco Ventures, <DATE>2021</DATE> L. Street <LOCATION>N.W.</LOCATION>, Suite 250, 
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION> 20036. Call toll-free (800) 862-8900. Price: <MONEY>$29.95</MONEY>, or two 
for <MONEY>$49.95</MONEY>. 
</P>
<P>
"Costa Rica" (<ORGANIZATION>Megaview Productions International</ORGANIZATION>), <DATE>1988</DATE>, 34 minutes. This is 
one of the few videos on <LOCATION>Costa Rica</LOCATION>, and it's remarkably good. For those who 
have been there, for those planning a trip or for those just curious, it's a 
worthwhile addition to a travel video collection. 
</P>
<P>
Against a montage of quick scenes showing some of the beauty and appeal of this 
Central American country -- lush green forests, rivers, volcanoes, gambling 
casinos and fishing -- the narrator gives viewers a bit of history as well as 
vital statistics on the high literacy rate, climate, number of bird species 
(850), national parks (26), which airlines fly there and an overview of the 
type of its hotels, facilities and restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
The major part of the video, however, takes viewers on a series of tours that 
cover the most popular tourist attractions. 
</P>
<P>
These include a tour of the capital, <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION>, showing scenes of the shopping 
district, central market place, national museum, national theater and 
restaurants. Side trips from <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION> include a visit to Sarchi and its ox-cart 
factory, where the colorful native souvenirs, as well as other crafts, are made 
and sold, and a visit to the enchanting <LOCATION>Orosi Valley</LOCATION> on the tumultuous 
<LOCATION>Reventazon River</LOCATION> for scenes of an exciting river rafting trip. This is followed 
by a tour to <LOCATION>Tiquicia</LOCATION>, "Tico" country, to a typical adobe farm-ranch restaurant 
to enjoy scenes of native food and entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
Irazu volcano, topping 11,000 feet and from which you can see both the 
<LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Pacific Ocean</LOCATION>, is another tour destination, as is a visit to the 
rim of the awesome, still-active Poas volcano. At <LOCATION>Cartago</LOCATION>, at the foot of 
Irazu, viewers also see the <LOCATION>Basilica de Los Angeles</LOCATION>, where the La Negrita (the 
Black Virgin) statue is enshrined and to whom miracles have been attributed. 
</P>
<P>
A video highlight is the ride on the jungle train that connects Limon to <LOCATION>San 
Jose</LOCATION>, passing through coffee and banana plantations and small villages of the 
interior. 
</P>
<P>
Other tours include a jungle adventure launch ride along the <LOCATION>Colorado River</LOCATION> and 
canals, with a stop at a lodge in the town of <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION>, and trips to the 
<ORGANIZATION>Monteverde Cloud Forest</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Carara Biological Reserve</ORGANIZATION> to view some of the 
many examples of the colorful and unusual plants, birds and animals being 
protected in <LOCATION>Costa Rica</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Nature lovers also will be rewarded with film and narration on the leatherback 
turtles seen laying their eggs on the beach. A final stop is at <LOCATION>Lake Arenal</LOCATION>, 
where fishermen are seen big-game fishing. 
</P>
<P>
Although the production was filmed in cooperation with the <ORGANIZATION>Swiss Travel 
Service</ORGANIZATION>, a tour company of <LOCATION>Costa Rica</LOCATION>, there are no blatant commercial plugs 
and no tie-ins with hotels or other tourist facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Tapes are available from <ORGANIZATION>Megaview Productions</ORGANIZATION>, 255 <ORGANIZATION>N. El Cielo Road</ORGANIZATION>, Suite 155, 
<LOCATION>Palm Springs</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION> 92262, (619) 366-8464. Price: <MONEY>$25</MONEY>.

<LEADPARA>  HARD-CORE news purists always have given CBS's "60 Minutes" gang a bad time
over the show's frequent "soft" interviews with show-business celebrities, but
now those show-biz interviews are beginning to look like solid gold.;   Case
in point: Tonight's two-hour CBS special, "60 Minutes: The Entertainers,"
culling some of the very best moments from all the show-biz interviews the
show has done over the past couple of decades. This is a terrifically
entertaining show, probably because the good parts of those interviews are so
good, and the bad parts were left behind in the archives.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Among the memorable moments:;   (check) <PERSON>Hume Cronyn</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jessica Tandy</PERSON>
faking out a startled <PERSON>Mike Wallace</PERSON> by pretending they'd decided to separate
because, as Cronyn put it, "<PERSON>Jess</PERSON> has her eye on another fellow, and I'd like
to play the field while I'm still vertical.";   (check) <PERSON>Lena Horne</PERSON>, at 64,
telling <PERSON>Ed Bradley</PERSON> she still sings earthy songs because "you can't help your
sexual nature.";   (check) Opera immortal <PERSON>Beverly Sills</PERSON> comparing herself to
"a fairly decent plumber.";   (check) <PERSON>Paul Simon</PERSON> grieving over the breakup of
his marriage to <PERSON>Carrie Fisher</PERSON> and celebrating a long overdue rapport with his
father.;   (check) <PERSON>Jackie Gleason</PERSON> explaining <PERSON>Ralph Kramden</PERSON>'s true character to
<ORGANIZATION>Morley Safer.</ORGANIZATION>;   As you might expect, veteran correspondent <PERSON>Wallace</PERSON> comes off
as the bete noir of the show, asking the rudest questions. We see him bullying
<PERSON>Vladimir Horowitz</PERSON> into playing "Stars and Stripes Forever" for the first time
in 20 years, accusing <PERSON>Johnny Carson</PERSON> of being an alcoholic, ridiculing <PERSON>Shirley
MacLaine</PERSON> for her New Age ideas ("You don't have to be that unpleasant," she
tells him. "It doesn't become you") and even asking <PERSON>Itzhak Perlman</PERSON> why so many
"world class fiddle players" are Jewish. ("Our fingers are circumcised,"
<PERSON>Perlman</PERSON> retorts.);   The result is a crackling two hours that will zip by
before you know it, leaving you with a hankering for more.; 'Beyond Reality';
The <ORGANIZATION>USA</ORGANIZATION> cable network is rapidly moving into more hours of original
programming. Unfortunately, not much of it is any better than "Beyond
Reality," an oddball hybrid that premieres tonight at 9. It falls somewhere
between a weekly mystery series and a "reality" show based on screwball cover
stories from the tabloids.;   <PERSON>Shari Belafonte</PERSON> and <PERSON>Carl Marotte</PERSON> play
parapsychologists who each week investigate a different case, which the
producers claim is based on "reported incidents." In the preview episode, they
check out one of <PERSON>Marotte</PERSON>'s college students, an introverted dweeb who walks
through her looking glass like <PERSON>Alice</PERSON> and into a parallel dimension where she
isn't a dweeb. This incident may have been reported somewhere, but I don't
think it was in the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> Times.;   Let me be kind and just say I found
"Beyond Reality" profoundly stupid.; 'Servants of Twilight'; Author <PERSON>Dean R.
Koontz</PERSON> is the cut-rate <PERSON>Stephen King</PERSON>, another horror novelist with some
impressive sales figures, especially in the paperback line. His great weakness
is his familiar plots. That's pretty much the main thing wrong with tonight's
<PERSON>Koontz</PERSON> adaptation, "Servants of Twilight," on the Showtime pay-TV network.;  
Based on <PERSON>Koontz</PERSON>'s "Twilight," the movie owes too much to "The Omen," with its
plot about religious fanatics trying to bump off a little boy they think is
the Anti-Christ. However, once you're past the first bumpy, flashback-choked
minutes, "Servants of Twilight" delivers plenty of thrills, even with the
stale plot.;   <PERSON>Bruce Greenwood</PERSON> plays the private detective trying to protect
unwed mother <PERSON>Belinda Bauer</PERSON> and her 6-year-old son (<PERSON>Jarrett Lennon</PERSON>) from the
evil followers of Mother Grace (<ORGANIZATION>Grace Zabriskie</ORGANIZATION>) and her Church of the
Twilight. Once he's on the case, we're in for a wild and violent chase that
leaves you quite breathless by the climactic struggle between good, evil, a
leftover giant from "Twin Peaks" and an attic full of bats.;   By no means is
"Servants of Twilight" a masterwork of the genre, but thrill-seekers could do
a lot worse than this fast-paced entertainment.; 'Zebras'; "Zebras: Patterns
in the Grass," <DATE>Sunday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>'s edition of "National Geographic Explorer" on the
<ORGANIZATION>TBS</ORGANIZATION> cable network, is a fascinating saga of the annual 300-mile migration of
zebra herds in <LOCATION>Botswana</LOCATION>. Here's one overwhelmingly good reason to watch: There
were 45,000 zebras making the journey in <DATE>1981</DATE>, but only 7,000 were left to try
this year.;   <PERSON>Narrator Brian Dennehy</PERSON> calls the trek a "gauntlet of death."
He's not kidding. We watch as lions, hyenas, wild dog packs and even hunters
ravage the herds as they head south to feed on fertile grasslands each year.; 
 Among the unusual sights captured by famed naturalists and film makers <PERSON>Dereck</PERSON>
and <LOCATION>Beverly Joubert</LOCATION>: mother zebras shielding their foals from other zebras so
the newborn progeny will learn to "home in" on only their mother's distinctive
pattern of stripes; stallions and "bachelor" zebras lining up to protect foals
from wild dogs; a female zebra's sire testing a male suitor's worthiness as a
mate by fighting with him; lions and hyenas dragging down an amazing 150 foals
in just 10 terror-filled days.;   This is another powerful film in this fine
series, reminding us of the majesty of the many species now in sharp decline
all over the world.; 'Played in the <ORGANIZATION>USA</ORGANIZATION>'; This <DATE>Sunday</DATE> cable's The Learning
Channel (TLC) starts a new 13-week series called "Played in the <ORGANIZATION>USA</ORGANIZATION>," which
chronicles the diversity of music performed in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> through the works of
independent film and video producers. The kickoff event is extra special: a
documentary on the recording of Broadway's "Company" soundtrack album, which
has been kept from public view for 20 years by a legal hassle.;   Filmed by

   The zonies and zdonks are sure bets, but
the aoudads were nothing but trouble, says a man who wants to make
a business out of exotic livestock.
   ``Believe me, away from here it's a good business. I just hope
to make it a good business here,'' said farmer <PERSON>Glawson Gantt</PERSON>.
   Gantt makes his living selling ordinary horses, cattle and
donkeys on his north <LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION> farm. But he expects to expand his
line within the next year.
   The 57-year-old entrepreneur, who already had buffaloes, llamas,
buzzards, peacocks and pheasants on his farm, bought two zebra
stallions at an exotic animal auction and plans to breed them to
his donkeys and <LOCATION>Shetland</LOCATION> ponies. The resulting animals will be
zdonks and zonies, <PERSON>Gantt</PERSON> said.
   ``Don't just everybody want a zebra,'' <PERSON>Gantt</PERSON> said recently.
``They're mean as Satan and if you take out after them there isn't
a fence that can hold them. But you mix them with a donkey or
Shetland pony and what you get is as sweet as can be.''
   The half-Shetland pony hybrid will sell for <MONEY>$1,500</MONEY>, the
donkey-zebra cross will go for up to <MONEY>$3,500</MONEY>, <PERSON>Gantt</PERSON> said.
   Although you won't find these animals in the dictionary, the
crossbreeding of zebras to donkeys and horses has been done for
years, said <PERSON>David Anderson</PERSON>, curator at the <ORGANIZATION>Audubon Zoo</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New
Orleans</LOCATION>. Zoos consider the resulting animals nothing but
curiosities, he said.
   Gantt already has had success with his bobbydoes. The half
sheep, half goat can sell for up to <MONEY>$600</MONEY>. He had less luck when he
was given some aoudads, a type of African sheep with long, curved
horns.
   ``They're kind of goat-looking things and can jump 16-foot
fences,'' he said. ``We couldn't keep ours penned up. As far as I
know they're still running wild out in the woods.
   ``I keep waiting to hear about some hunter shooting a creature
that nobody can identify, but I guess they can't catch up with them
either.''

<HEAD>Federal Study: Global Warming Could Help Bass, Limit Forests</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM BOVEE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Such fish as bass and lake trout would
flourish in <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>, and the Great Lakes' shipping season would
lengthen if the greenhouse effect warms the Earth a few degrees, a
major federal study says.
   The ice season on Lake Superior would be shortened by one month
to three months, and on <LOCATION>Lake Erie</LOCATION> by two mohths to three months,
increasing shipping seasons there, said an unreleased <ORGANIZATION>Environmental
Protection Agency</ORGANIZATION> study that is to be submitted to the <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> in
<DATE>December</DATE>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Associated Press</ORGANIZATION> obtained a draft of a summary of the
effects of global warming, which is caused by a growing
concentration of carbon dioxide and other gases that trap heat in
the atmosphere.
   The gases that cause the greenhouse effect are produced mainly
by the industries that have spread around the world since the
mid-19th century. Auto exhausts also contribute to the effect.
   While shipping could benefit, the higher temperatures likely
would reduce the snow pack in the <LOCATION>Great Lakes</LOCATION> region and increase
evaporation. That combination would reduce lake levels, possibly
necessitating dredging ports and channels, the study said.
   The water level of Lake Superior, on average, would be 1\ feet
to 1{ feet lower than now, and <LOCATION>Lake Michigan</LOCATION>'s water level would
fall dramatically by 3 feet to 8 feet, the study said.
   The <ORGANIZATION>EPA</ORGANIZATION> study also said <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>'s hardwood forests might be
replaced by savannas and grasslands because of the greenhouse
effect, which would open <LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wisconsin</LOCATION> and northern <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>
to increased cultivation.
   The decline of the northern forests would become evident in 30
years to 60 years, the study said.
   The result by the middle of the 21st century will be an average
global temperature of three degrees to eight degrees Fahrenheit
higher than now, most scientists believe.
   ``Northern hardwood forests in <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> may be reduced to oak
savannas or grasslands, and mixed boreal and northern hardwood
forests in northern <LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION> may become all northern hardwoods,''
the study said.
   The reduction in forests and increased cultivation in the north
could increase erosion and runoff, harming water quality, the study
said.
   And while some fish would thrive, a greater temperature
difference between the surface of the lakes and their depths might
reduce the amount of oxygen in the lower levels and disrupt the
annual turnover of the water, the study said.
   Fish species in shallow lakes and rivers could suffer from the
higher temperatures, the study said.
   A political effect of global warming might be increased demands
for a diversion of Great Lakes water for use outside the region,
the study said.

<P>
I couldn't be sure how many were out there. They had just shaken me from a deep 
sleep, a herd of cavorting hippopotamuses bellowing like out-of-tune tubas as 
they blundered and splashed in the dark waters a hundred feet from my tent. 
</P>
<P>
No one had said anything about camping with hippos, I thought as I listened to 
their midnight mirth on the shore of <LOCATION>Lake Baringo</LOCATION>. I lay awake most of the 
<TIME>night</TIME>, tracking their sounds through my canvas tent and waiting to sidle into 
the darkness to the distant latrine. But even when the revelry subsided and the 
camp seemed calm, the snorts and grunts of a lone hippo grazing between the 
tents kept me stranded inside. 
</P>
<P>
By the time I finally left the tent, the African sun was burning through the 
dawn clouds. The hippos were back in the lake resting, only their heads poked 
through the water, brown bumps peeping at the shore. We eight campers peered 
back, shaking our heads in awe and amusement at our obnoxious neighbors. I 
walked toward the lake to get a closer look. Two hippos yawned, showing 
cavernous, pink mouths. Others paddled closer, then circled out in single file 
and disappeared into the lake. 
</P>
<P>
"Camping," a friend said as we walked back to our tents, "is the only way to 
see <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>." 
</P>
<P>
That's the sentiment that convinced me to go camping for the first time. Until 
then, my idea of roughing it had been staying at a motel without an ice 
machine. But as our group reached the halfway point on a two-week camping 
safari through <LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION>'s most popular lakes and game parks in the <DATE>summer</DATE> of <DATE>last 
year</DATE>, I couldn't imagine better accommodations. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, there are more comfortable ways to go on safari. One can see 
elephants grazing or lions playing in the high grass as easily from a lodge as 
from a campsite. But to fully experience the world beyond a minibus window, 
camping is authentically best. The sound of a hyena prowling outside your tent 
wraps you in the romance and reality of <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The snow-covered peak of <LOCATION>Tanzania</LOCATION>'s Mt. Kilimanjaro loomed through a sheath of 
clouds like a celestial being. On the blazing plain below, a bearded wildebeest 
scampered before a dozen grazing zebras, darting and leaping in a lunatic 
dance. A jackal ran ahead of the bus, then dived into the brush. A small herd 
of elephants grazed near the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
We had just arrived in <ORGANIZATION>Amboseli National Park</ORGANIZATION> after a four-hour trek on the 
dusty, pockmarked roads from <LOCATION>Nairobi</LOCATION>. Our guide, <PERSON>Joseph</PERSON>, sat amused in the 
driver's seat, politely jerking the minibus to a stop with each oohhh and aahhh 
from behind. "We will get much closer to the animals," he said. "Are you sure?" 
someone asked. "Yes, yes. I am sure. Trust me," he said, then laughed. 
</P>
<P>
A 30ish member of the Kikuyu tribe with extensive knowledge of the game parks, 
<PERSON>Joseph</PERSON> not only tracked animals but maneuvered the minibus to within a few feet 
of fighting elephants and feeding lions. Amboseli, one of <LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION>'s smallest game 
parks, is famous for its herds of wildebeests, <ORGANIZATION>Burchell</ORGANIZATION>'s zebras, water 
buffaloes, gazelles and a handful of the endangered rhinoceroses, but it's the 
elephants that seize the imagination. 
</P>
<P>
Although the elephants have been heavily poached for their ivory during the 
last decade, the gray giants seemed to be everywhere in <LOCATION>Amboseli</LOCATION>. They grazed 
in herds numbering from a few individuals to a few hundred, always with 
sentries posted for their only predator, man. 
</P>
<P>
Alongside our minibus, a calf tried to filch a bunch of grass that another calf 
had shaken free of dirt. A bull inexplicably dropped to its front knees and 
kicked its hind legs like a circus performer. Two juveniles squared off in 
play, their trunks entwined, one driving the other like a sumo wrestler into 
our shadow. 
</P>
<P>
At dusk we drove to our campsite, marked by a stone in a cluster of thorn trees 
surrounded by the the dusty plain. 
</P>
<P>
This is the no-frills camp. Those wishing more pampered treatment can choose 
from several luxury tour operators who offer campsites with permanent tents and 
private baths, meals served on fine china and good wines. But we were 
comfortable enough in our rickety abodes, sleeping in bags on thin foam 
mattresses and dining on staples -- lots of bread, cheese and fresh fruit. The 
cost was about <MONEY>$1,200</MONEY> each. 
</P>
<P>
Our first night in the bush was cool and quiet; it surprised me. I expected the 
night to be more menacing and claustrophobic. The cook managed a good meal of 
pasta, potatoes and beans on a fire that brought our group together under the 
sparkling canopy of the <LOCATION>Southern Hemisphere</LOCATION>. Over drinks, we traded stories of 
travels and careers, and drifted into the darkness to our tents. 
</P>
<P>
During the next few days our routine was to drive in the morning to view 
wildlife and return in the heat of the day to camp, some to sit at the shaded 
table to read or write letters, while others washed clothes or napped. 
</P>
<P>
One afternoon I followed the sounds of laughter from my tent to the edge of 
camp, where three young Masai herdsmen leaned against a minibus, talking with a 
few of our group. They wore traditional red cloth, tied like a toga over their 
lanky frames. Elaborate red and yellow earrings dangled from their spool-sized 
lobes. Their hair, braided and matted with red ocher and fat, stained the backs 
of their necks. 
</P>
<P>
The eldest of them let us examine his weapons. He appeared to be in his 20s, 
but no one was sure -- years are not counted by the <LOCATION>Masai</LOCATION>. We touched the sword 
and spear he used to protect his cattle from predators. The Masai protect their 
herds fiercely, for not only do they measure their worth in cattle, they live 
on milk and blood drawn from living cows. 
</P>
<P>
We spent two more hours together. They were intrigued by our jewelry, cameras 
and sunglasses. Then they returned to the bush to watch their cattle graze 
under the high sun. We went back to writing and reading about the people of 
<LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
After three days in <LOCATION>Amboseli</LOCATION>, we headed north through the lush forests and 
grasslands of <LOCATION>Mt. Kenya</LOCATION>, then out on the plains to the <ORGANIZATION>Samburu Game Reserve</ORGANIZATION>. We 
set up camp on the sandy banks of the Ewaso Ng'iro, a muddy oasis amid a 
parched landscape of desert scrub and savanna that's home to a range of 
wildlife. It's one of the few places in <LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION> to see the reticulated giraffe 
and the <PERSON>Grevey</PERSON>'s zebra, together with Marabou storks, gazelles, dik-dik and 
gerenuk (varieties of antelope), and, of course, vultures. 
</P>
<P>
Samburu brought home the usual risks of camping: a snake near the latrine, 
warnings of scorpions and of crocodiles. An unusual risk, too: "There has been 
some trouble with Sudanese refugees," our guide said as he explained why two 
guards armed with machine guns had been hired to patrol the camp. 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>Sudan</LOCATION> was 300 miles from our camp, an unlikely source of danger. Only after our 
return to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> did the reason become clear: In <DATE>July, 1989</DATE>, 
poachers and bandits were believed to have slain five tourists, including a 
<LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION> woman, in the game parks. Since then the Kenyan government has 
stepped up patrols and instituted a shoot-to-kill policy against poachers. The 
<ORGANIZATION>U.S. State Department</ORGANIZATION> currently says security has "improved markedly" but 
cautions against solo camping. 
</P>
<P>
We moved west from <LOCATION>Samburu</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Lake Baringo</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION>'s lake region in the scar 
of the <LOCATION>Rift Valley</LOCATION>. The rough roads carried us slowly through the late-morning 
bustle of small villages. A man, twirling a blade of grass in his teeth, walked 
his bicycle past a woman balancing a basket of vegetables on her head. Outside 
the villages, herdsmen pushed their goats and cows through the valley fields. 
</P>
<P>
The most famous of the <LOCATION>Rift Valley</LOCATION> lakes is <LOCATION>Lake Nakuru</LOCATION>, where, in one of the 
world's greatest bird spectacles, 2 million flamingos gather in alkaline waters 
to feast on its algae. 
</P>
<P>
One sees a bustle of pink and white as the birds skittishly preen, feed, honk 
and flap. Their spindly necks and legs belie the gracefulness they reach in the 
air, black-spotted wings and outstretched bodies in effortless flight which 
concludes with a running splash in the shallow waters. 
</P>
<P>
The national park at <LOCATION>Lake Nakuru</LOCATION> pales in comparison with the others; we saw 
only a few water bucks and oryxes there. But, as with the hippos at <LOCATION>Lake 
Baringo</LOCATION>, the best wildlife encounters took place at the campsite. As we set up 
camp under the tall acacias, water bucks grazed in the lush green grass, dozens 
of Vervet monkeys skittered about and a handful of baboons retreated to the 
bushes behind our tents. 
</P>
<P>
At night a group of bush pigs crashed through the food tent, bumbling in the 
dark through the cans and pots. The cook screamed to scare them off, and a few 
of us laughed as he muttered about his sleepless night. 
</P>
<P>
We left the <ORGANIZATION>Rift Valley</ORGANIZATION> -- and the only campsites with showers and toilets -- 
for three days in <ORGANIZATION>Masai Mara</ORGANIZATION>, the largest and last game park on our safari. The 
<ORGANIZATION>Masai Mara Game Reserve</ORGANIZATION> ranges over 974 square miles that adjoin the Serengeti 
Plain of <LOCATION>Tanzania</LOCATION> and is famous for the more than 1 million wildebeests and 
thousands of zebras, gazelles and antelopes that migrate there once a year. 
</P>
<P>
We found instead a smattering of gazelles, giraffes, topi and anxious predators 
amid an Edenic landscape of grassy plains and acacia trees. 
</P>
<P>
A male lion, his ribs showing through an emaciated body, moved slowly along the 
plain. The wind rustled his black mane. Behind him, in the golden camouflage of 
the savanna, three lionesses licked and nuzzled their cubs as they grappled for 
milk. 
</P>
<P>
On the horizon, five giraffes marched in a row, heads bobbing in unison. Shafts 
of light broke through a low cumulus canopy onto hundreds of <ORGANIZATION>Thomsen</ORGANIZATION>'s gazelles 
as they grazed. 
</P>
<P>
These and other images that unfolded during the next three days enraptured me 
as we crisscrossed the vast <ORGANIZATION>Masai Mara</ORGANIZATION>. Even the driving rainstorm that 
shortened our last game drive and toppled my tent left me secured by this 
noble, pristine landscape. 
</P>
<P>
It was our <TIME>last night</TIME> on safari. The rain had soaked my tent and sleeping bag 
and left me only a small spot to sit on. I waited for the storm to end, 
remembering a conversation I had with a Kikuyu merchant at a roadside stand. 
</P>
<P>
"How do you like our country?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
"It is quite beautiful," I said. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, but it is only beautiful to the foreigner," he said. "To us it's only 
very poor." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed the realities of <LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION> -- the potholes of its capital, the poaching of 
its wildlife -- belie much of the land's romance. Some of us carried <PERSON>Karen 
Blixen</PERSON> books and other adventure stories to help us imagine a world long gone. 
</P>
<P>
But as we drove through <PERSON>Masai Mara</PERSON> for the final time, a shared, primeval 
heritage still seemed to beat on these vast plains. It was quiet and empty and 
I watched the bus tracks dissolve in the grass. I wished to see a giraffe or 
gazelle for the last time, but there was nothing, only a solitary, crooked 
acacia twitching in the wind.

<LEADPARA>  With the help of the drought, the tiny, audacious Asian clam has taken over
northern San Francisco Bay and is advancing south, stripping the water of
nutrients and wrecking whole ecosystems.;    Scientists hope the eventual end
of the drought will stem the invasion, which started in 1986.  </LEADPARA>

LIFE  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     But they are not optimistic. The Asian clam, it turns out, is a fierce
competitor and a near-perfect feeding machine that will risk its life for a
good meal.;    It has a "very daring lifestyle for a clam," said <PERSON>Janet
Thompson</PERSON>, a biologist at the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Geological Survey</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Menlo Park</LOCATION> who has been
tracking the creature's steamroller spread down the bay.;    "They're very
well-adapted," she added. "If I were to go and design a clam, this would be
it.";    The diminutive Potamocorbula amurensis, just over an inch long, was
flushed into <LOCATION>Carquinez Strait</LOCATION> in the ballast water of a ship five years ago.
Since researchers had been monitoring the area's bottom-dwelling animals for
more than a decade, they noticed the invasion right away.;    It was not the
first time a new species had hitchhiked from across the world; most of the
bay's bottom-dwellers are imported, said <PERSON>Frederic H. Nichols</PERSON>, a biological
oceanographer with the USGS.;    But it was one of the most successful. Within
a year, it had taken over <LOCATION>Suisun</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>San Pablo</LOCATION> bays and was heading south,
where it has set up thriving colonies along the east shore of the bay and in
deep shipping channels between the <LOCATION>San Mateo</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Dumbarton</LOCATION> bridges.;    The
clam had an unwitting ally in the strange weather patterns of the past few
years, <PERSON>Nichols</PERSON> told a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION>Geological Society of America</ORGANIZATION> on
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE> in <LOCATION>San Francisco.</LOCATION>;    Starting in <DATE>1984</DATE>, he said, drought dried up
river flows into the <LOCATION>North Bay</LOCATION>, turning the water saltier and encouraging
growth of salt-loving species.;    But in <DATE>early 1986</DATE>, a rainy spell flooded
the area with fresh water, wiping out the salt-lovers almost overnight, he
said. Just then, the Asian clam arrived, proliferating so quickly that the
other species had no chance to make a comeback.;    While the clam has thrived
in the salty conditions of the continuing drought, lab tests indicate that
it's just as happy to live in fresh water, dampening scientists' hopes that it
will disappear when the drought ends and rivers run high again.;    "But
Mother Nature does things we don't do" in the lab, <PERSON>Thompson</PERSON> said. "When the
drought breaks, we'll know.";    Asian clams are fast and efficient feeders.
In <LOCATION>Suisun Bay</LOCATION>, they filter enough water every day to fill the bay, straining
out the tiny floating organisms that make up the base of the food chain and
dramatically changing the ecology.;    Diving ducks and sturgeon are feasting
on the invaders, biologists said. But striped bass and other fish may suffer
for lack of food, although right now it's hard to distinguish the effects of
the clam invasion from those of the drought.;    <PERSON>Thompson</PERSON> has developed a
grudging admiration for the creatures as she follows their spread into the
<LOCATION>South Bay.</LOCATION>;    So far, they show no sign of taking over there, she said,
possibly because the bottom is already covered with a thick, thriving
community of clams, worms and crustaceans.;    But <PERSON>Thompson</PERSON> said the clams'
lifestyle makes them formidable, and it will take at least six more months of
monitoring to determine how far they are likely to spread.;    The clams
settle on the bottom in the middle of the fastest currents and anchor
themselves with protein fibers, similar to the "beards" of mussels, stuck far
into the mud or sand.;    While other clams play it safe, burying themselves
in the mud to hide from predators, the Asian clams poke boldly out into the
water and stretch out their siphons to suck in the maximum amounts of water
and food.  </TEXT>

FT  28 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: US copper project defeats
ecological mussel-power
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF the most bitterly fought battles between environmentalists and miners
enters a new phase next month when work re-starts on the Dollars 20m
development of <ORGANIZATION>Flambeau Mining</ORGANIZATION>'s copper project in <LOCATION>Wisconsin</LOCATION>.
The hugely-rich but relatively small deposit, now owned by <ORGANIZATION>RTZ</ORGANIZATION>, the world's
biggest mining group, was first found in <DATE>1968</DATE> but it was not until last year
that all the permits were in place for development which began in <DATE>August</DATE>.
Then environmental researchers successfully applied to a <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> judge for work
to be halted because they said purple warty back mussels and other
threatened or endangered species were found in the <LOCATION>Flambeau River</LOCATION> about a
mile from where the mining company plans a drain pipe outlet.
<PERSON>Mr Larry Mercando</PERSON>, vice president and general manager of <ORGANIZATION>Flambeau Mining</ORGANIZATION>,
said yesterday that <LOCATION>Wisconsin</LOCATION>'s state <ORGANIZATION>Department of Natural Resources</ORGANIZATION> had
now issued a revised environmental impact statement that clearly stated the
mine's operations would have no effect on any threatened or endangered
species.
The episode had delayed mining by about six months, he added. First ore
should be shipped in <DATE>June, 1993</DATE>. However, <PERSON>Mr Mercando</PERSON> admitted: 'We are
ready and prepared for more attacks by environmentalists. They never give
up.'
<PERSON>Mr Mercando</PERSON> estimates that about 70 per cent of the Dollars 20m-Dollars 30
cost of the mine will go towards environmental protection measures - the
biggest cost is for a water treatment plant to ensure that water discarded
by the mine is more pure than any found in nature.
The recent production delay was caused by a civil action against the state
department by the <ORGANIZATION>Sierra Club</ORGANIZATION>, a group of environmental activists, and the
<ORGANIZATION>Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa</ORGANIZATION> natives, who say the mine
could spoil fishing by polluting the <LOCATION>Flambeau River</LOCATION>, a tributary of the
<LOCATION>Chippewa</LOCATION>, which drains into the <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION>.
Environmentalists are also concerned because the copper deposit is in a
heavily wooded area with is no industrial activity. Flambeau's will be the
first mine to be developed in <LOCATION>Wisconsin</LOCATION> since the <LOCATION>Shullsburg</LOCATION> lead-zinc mine
closed in <DATE>1979</DATE>.
<ORGANIZATION>Kennecott Corporation</ORGANIZATION>, now an <ORGANIZATION>RTZ</ORGANIZATION> subsidiary, has owned the deposit for 20
years and persevered because it is exceptionally rich. The ore contains 10.5
per cent of copper whereas most miners would be happy with 2 or <MONEY>3 per cent</MONEY>.
Unfortunately, there is only about 1.9m tonnes of ore. As this will be dug
out at the rate of 320,000 tonnes a year, the mine will have a life of only
six years.
