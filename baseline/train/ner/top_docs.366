FT  25 JAN 92 / Sport: Bills seek their place in history - American Football
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<PERSON>MARV LEVY</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Harvard</ORGANIZATION> graduate, history buff and poetry lover, talks a mean
game of American football.
The silver-haired head coach of the <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> Bills analyses the strategies
and tactics of the sport in a precise, elegant manner. His comments in press
conferences can come laced with literary allusions. He uses words like
'inculcate' and 'salient' in pre-game meetings with his team.
Tomorrow in <LOCATION>Minneapolis</LOCATION>, however, the erudite <PERSON>Levy</PERSON> will leave the talking to
his players, who must play a mean game of football if they are to defeat the
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> Redskins in Superbowl XXVI.
The Redskins start as favourites, and are expected to win by at least seven
points according to the bookmakers in <LOCATION>Las Vegas</LOCATION>. Yet for those of us who
have enjoyed watching the Bills this season, it is difficult to think of
them as underdogs.
Under <PERSON>Levy</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> has set the <ORGANIZATION>National Football League</ORGANIZATION> alight in the past
two seasons with a rapid-fire passing and running game which led the team to
a host of high scoring victories.
At the root of their success is the 'no-huddle' offense - a tactic that
dispenses with the huddle before each play and allows the quarterback to
call his own moves. At its best, the no-huddle offense puts points on the
board quickly and leaves opposing defenses scrambling to keep up with the
pace.
At the heart of the Bills attack are two great players, quarterback <PERSON>Jim
Kelly</PERSON> and all-purpose running back <PERSON>Thurman Thomas</PERSON>. Kelly is an experienced
leader with a sharp tactical brain and a strong arm, while <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON> is a
superb all-rounder, a quicksilver runner and an acrobatic receiver.
Powered by <PERSON>Kelly</PERSON> and <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON>, and supported by receivers <PERSON>James Lofton</PERSON> and
<PERSON>Andre Reed</PERSON>, the Bills topped the statistical tables in a number of key
attacking categories this season, including most total yards gained and most
touchdowns scored.
So with all their offensive firepower, why aren't the Bills favourites to
win?
There are two reasons, and both come down to defense. The Redskins' defense
is strong, against both the running and the passing game, and it ranks third
best in the league for overall effectiveness.
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>'s defense is especially good at 'blitzing' the quarterback - in
the 16 regular games this season they reached opposing quarterbacks and
sacked them 50 times. <PERSON>Kelly</PERSON> has looked vulnerable to the sack in the past,
particularly two weekends ago when the <ORGANIZATION>Denver Broncos</ORGANIZATION>' blitzed relentlessly,
giving <PERSON>Kelly</PERSON> insufficient time to get his no-huddle offense into gear.
The fragility of their own defense, which ranked next-to-last in the league
this season, is the second reason why the Bills are not favourites tomorrow.
They have shown an improvement in the playoffs (holding <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION> to just seven
points in the AFC Championship game), thanks partly to the return of two
powerful players, slashing defensive end <PERSON>Bruce Smith</PERSON> and bulldozing nose
tackle <PERSON>Jeff Wright</PERSON>.
Yet in the <LOCATION>Redskins</LOCATION>, the Bills defense will be facing one of the toughest
offensive lines in football. This is where the 'Hogs' come in. Hogs is the
collective nickname for the enormous front-line that defends Redskins'
quarterback <PERSON>Mark Rypien</PERSON>.
Not only are the Hogs good at giving <PERSON>Rypien</PERSON> time to throw long passes to
receivers Art Monk, <PERSON>Gary Clark</PERSON> and <PERSON>Ricky Sanders</PERSON> (the protection has been so
effective that <PERSON>Rypien</PERSON> was sacked just nine times all season), but they are
also adept at knocking holes in defensive lines for backs <PERSON>Ernest Byner</PERSON>,
<PERSON>Ricky Ervins</PERSON> and <PERSON>Gerald Riggs</PERSON> to run through.
One big advantage the Redskins have is the versatility of their attack. The
Bills rely heavily, perhaps too heavily, on <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON>'s all-round skills. Stop
<PERSON>Thomas</PERSON>, and <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> usually struggles.
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>'s three running backs possess different strengths and styles
providing a balance of power and precision. The trio of fleet wide receivers
spread defenses and regularly break open for long yardage. The variety of
attacking options available to Redskins coach <PERSON>Joe Gibbs</PERSON> helps explain why
his team was the highest-scoring unit in the <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> this season.
Yet, as any fan of sports cliches knows, statistics and history mean little
when it comes to one Big Game. The difference may ultimately lie in
motivation, and how badly each team wants to win.
In this respect, the Bills could have the edge. It has been 363 days since
<PERSON>Scott Norwood</PERSON>'s potential game-winning kick sailed wide of the right hand
goalpost in the closing seconds of Superbowl XXV against the <ORGANIZATION>New York
Giants</ORGANIZATION>, and the determination of the Bills to avenge that loss burns just as
bright as it did a year ago.
Both teams have prepared thoroughly, but <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> seem to have gone about
their business amid the outrageous hype and publicity of Superbowl week in a
quieter, more purposeful manner.
And while less than half of the Redskins are survivors from the team's last
Superbowl appearance in <DATE>1987</DATE>, the Bills squad is much the same as it was
last year. The memories of that game are still fresh for <PERSON>Jim Kelly</PERSON>, <PERSON>Thurman
Thomas</PERSON>, and <PERSON>Bruce Smith</PERSON>. My money is on <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> to win by three points,
courtesy of kicker <PERSON>Scott Norwood</PERSON>.

FT  25 JAN 92 / Markets: It is all go for the Superbowl predictor - Wall
Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE <LOCATION>WASHINGTON</LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION>Redskins</ORGANIZATION> will defeat the <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> Bills in the Superbowl
tomorrow, and US stock markets will remain bullish all year. No, a
combination of the cold weather and Superbowl hype has not gone to my head.
I am only paying heed to one of Wall Street's most effective forecasting
tools: the Superbowl Predictor.
The theory is simple. Victory for a team from the old <ORGANIZATION>National Football
League</ORGANIZATION> forecasts a year of rising stock prices, while victory for a team
from the old <ORGANIZATION>American Football League</ORGANIZATION> (the two leagues merged in <DATE>1970</DATE>)
heralds a year of falling prices. The Redskins are favoured to win in
<LOCATION>Minneapolis</LOCATION> tomorrow, and because they are an old <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> team, Wall Street
believes it is in for a good year.
You may scoff, but since the first Superbowl in <DATE>1967</DATE>, the Predictor has
worked 22 out of 25 times, a success rate of 88 per cent. There is no other
leading indicator that comes close to matching it.
The theory can also work in reverse. The stock markets have started <DATE>1992</DATE> in
buoyant mood, and should continue to enjoy solid gains throughout the year,
if you believe the consensus. Thus, the bulls predict the Bills will lose
and the Skins win. Confused?
Investors certainly are. This was a difficult week for the markets, which
posted some of the first significant losses since the rally began in
<DATE>mid-December</DATE>. There was a 32-point gain midweek, but that owed more to
late-session program trading than it did to renewed demand from investors.
Profit-taking was the dominant factor, with traders and investors taking the
opportunity to book some of the gains earned in the month-long rally. At the
same time, buyers have been scanning the market for sectors that could offer
a good ride over the next few weeks.
Technical trading aside, investors appear uncertain as to what to do next. A
vast amount of money has flooded into the market since the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Reserve</ORGANIZATION>
slashed interest rates at the end of <DATE>last year</DATE>, most of it from
lower-yielding short-term assets such as bank certificates of deposit and
money market funds.
That initial energy is probably now spent. Since the last rate cut on
<DATE>December 20</DATE>, the Dow has risen more than 10 per cent and the <ORGANIZATION>Standard &amp;
Poor</ORGANIZATION>'s 500 8.6 per cent, and it is difficult to justify adding to those
gains until some fresh stimulus other than lower interest rates
materialises.
This means any advance in the market from now on must come either from
better economic fundamentals or an improvement in the outlook for corporate
earnings. On the economic front, the news has remained gloomy. This week
contained little that pointed to a brighter future, while one set of
backward-looking figures, the final count for housing starts in <DATE>1991</DATE>,
testified to the depth of the recession last year.
Despite a modest rebound in housing starts in <DATE>December</DATE> (they rose 2.6 per
cent), over the full year they posted a 1.1 per cent decline, the worst
showing since <DATE>1945</DATE>. Although stock markets should only pay attention to
leading economic indicators, the housing numbers for <DATE>1991</DATE> show just how much
ground one of a key sector of the economy has to reclaim before the recovery
can be classified healthy.
As for corporate earnings, the quarterly reporting season continues to
produce an unappetising diet of the good, the bad and the ugly.
For <ORGANIZATION>United Technologies</ORGANIZATION>, the <DATE>fourth quarter</DATE> loss of Dollars 1.22bn was about
as ugly as it gets. In its defence, <ORGANIZATION>United Tech</ORGANIZATION>'s loss was the product of a
Dollars 1.275bn charge to cover the cost of a huge restructuring, which the
aerospace and building group hopes will go toward restoring its good looks.
There is a price for the economy to pay, however, in the loss of almost
14,000 jobs and the closure of a host of <ORGANIZATION>United Tech</ORGANIZATION> facilities.
<ORGANIZATION>Delta Air Lines</ORGANIZATION> was another to report an unattractive loss for the final
quarter of the year. The Dollars 237m shortfall was partly a hangover from
<ORGANIZATION>Delta</ORGANIZATION>'s purchase of the failed <ORGANIZATION>Pan Am</ORGANIZATION>'s east coast shuttle operations and
transatlantic routes. The figures were not warmly received by investors who
had been keen buyers of the stocks until recently. Having peaked at over
<LOCATION>Dollars 75</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Delta</ORGANIZATION> ran into heavy selling in the latter half of the week and
by yesterday lunchtime had settled at Dollars 71.
The best corporate news of the week came from a most unlikely source - a
computer manufacturer. <ORGANIZATION>Unisys</ORGANIZATION> recorded <DATE>fourth quarter</DATE> profits of Dollars
80.5m, and reported that orders booked during the <DATE>last three months of 1991</DATE>
were the heaviest for five years. The market loved it, and the shares
bounced from Dollars 5 1/2 at the start of the week to Dollars 7 1/2 at the
end, a handsome 36 per cent gain.

<HEAD>NBC's `Hunter' an Ex-Reporter, Sort Of</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   It's not widely known, but <PERSON>Fred Dryer</PERSON> played a
hard-boiled sports reporter before he became the hard-eyed
constable of <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION>'s ``Hunter.'' The occasion: a Superbowl press
conference in <DATE>January 1975</DATE>.
   He and <PERSON>Lance Rentzel</PERSON> wore battered fedoras with hatbrim cards
that said PRESS. They technically were employed by the <ORGANIZATION>Los Angeles
Rams</ORGANIZATION> then. But they had press credentials secured by <PERSON>Dick Schaap</PERSON>,
then a magazine sports editor.
   In their non-Rams capacity as newshawks, Dryer recalls, they
asked such probing questions as: ``They say this is the Big Game
and there's no tomorrow. Will you in fact be disappointed when the
sun comes up tomorrow?''
   For some reason, this caused grumbling from scribes who took pro
football as almost seriously as TV does. Most, however, realized a
put-on was under way. Not so some <ORGANIZATION>National Football League</ORGANIZATION>
functionaries.
   ``They went crazy,'' <PERSON>Dryer</PERSON> said with slight grin. In due course,
he said, then-NFL Commissioner <PERSON>Pete Rozelle</PERSON> made inquiries: ``He
said, `I understand you guys are reporters. What are you doing?'
   ``I said, `Well, we're here to cover the news and print the .. .
unmentioned. There's a lot of smut that needs to be punched up, and
we're just the two guys to do it.'''
   The light dawned. Rozelle realized it was a spoof. The
Superbowl, in which the Rams weren't playing, came and went.
   Six years later, so did Dryer, at least from pro ball after 13
seasons as a defensive tackle for the Rams and <ORGANIZATION>New York Giants</ORGANIZATION>.
Although he knew that party had to end sometime, he hadn't
particularly thought what he'd do after football until <DATE>1978</DATE>, he
said.
   Then, after considering and rejecting life in real estate, he
began considering the acting business, then studied it for five
years with actress <PERSON>Nina Foch</PERSON>.
   ``I had to find out what it was, how interested I was in it, and
most important, could I make a living at it,'' he says.
   Small roles here and there followed, including four ``Cheers''
episodes as <PERSON>Ted Danson</PERSON>'s old pal from baseball days. Then he read
for ``Hunter,'' which some critics would later sneer at as a
small-screen edition of ``Dirty Harry.''
   Similar sneers greeted his first venture into feature films, a
modern Marine shoot-'em-up called ``Death Before Dishonor,'' two
years ago. It proved dead on arrival at the box office, for which
<ORGANIZATION>Dryer</ORGANIZATION> blames the producers.
   But ``Hunter'' has lasted six seasons with Dryer as its lean,
blue-jeaned star. <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION> has found it a durable <DATE>Saturday</DATE> series.
   The network, which in mid-April shifted ``Hunter'' to <DATE>Mondays</DATE>,
says a seventh season is likely. If so, <PERSON>Dryer</PERSON>, who says it already
has been renewed, will start anew with a new female partner.
   <PERSON>Stepfanie Kramer</PERSON> is giving up her role as <PERSON>Hunter</PERSON>'s sidekick,
Sgt. <PERSON>Dee Dee McCall</PERSON>, for films and singing. Her swan song, so to
speak, will occur in <DATE>Monday</DATE>'s episode when she marries an old flame.
   Dryer, who at 6-foot-6 is the tallest of TV's cops, pondered a
visitor's theory. It had nothing to do with <PERSON>Kramer</PERSON>'s departure.
   The theory was that pro football players-turned-actors seem to
be more successful and tend to have longer runs in network series
if they've played on the defensive line.
   Two examples: <PERSON>Merlin Olsen</PERSON> and <PERSON>Alex Karras</PERSON>. The former piled up
more than seven years in <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION>'s ``Little House on the Prairie,''
``Father Murphy'' and the short-lived `Aaron's Way.'' Karras had
four <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION> years in ``<PERSON>Webster</PERSON>.''
   True, former running back <PERSON>Ed Marinaro</PERSON> had five seasons as a
co-star of ``Hill Street Blues.'' But the much better-known
quarterback, <PERSON>Joe Namath</PERSON>, lasted only one month as the star of <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION>'s
``The Waverly Wonders.''
   Dryer thought about all this. His eyes took on an evil glint.
``Well,'' he said, ``I think the true intelligence is in defense.''
   __
   Elsewhere in television:
   ANOTHER REASON TO CONTINUE LIVING: An <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION> movie based on the
``Archie'' cartoon strip, will be shown <DATE>Sunday</DATE>. In it, <PERSON>Archie</PERSON>,
<PERSON>Veronica</PERSON>, Jughead and <PERSON>Betty</PERSON> now are thirtysomething and coping with
adult problems like divorce, careers and single parenthood.
   BERGENS EVERYWHERE: <PERSON>Frances Bergen</PERSON>, mother of the star of <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION>'
``<PERSON>Murphy Brown</PERSON>,'' will be the guest star of the show's <DATE>May 21</DATE>
episode, in which Corky (Faith Ford) gets married. <PERSON>Mrs. Bergen</PERSON>, who
plays the groom's mother, probably will be watching the <DATE>May 19</DATE>
edition of <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION>'s ``<DATE>Saturday</DATE> Night Live'' with great interest.
<PERSON>Candace Bergen</PERSON> will be the show's host.

<LEADPARA>  Fifteen tons of sand doesn't make a beach. But the 18 groups that showed up
for the Sand Castles and Other Architectural Marvels Contest in Palo Alto knew
how to fake it. They pretended that the plaza in front of City Hall was

Friday. Event organizers had contemplated cancellation earlier in the day.  </LEADPARA>

the third-annual contest continued.;    The mondo speakers didn't blast the
Beach Boys or Jan and Dean. Instead, the <ORGANIZATION>Cowboy Junkies</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Elvis Costello</PERSON>
serenaded contestants. But they seemed oblivious to the music. Sand-castle
building is serious business. Many design firms and architectural companies
entered. Some even brought blue prints for their creations. It was not exactly
kid stuff here.;    The kids were restricted to a couple of "community
sandboxes," where they seemed to have a heap more fun than the adults.;    The
adults were too busy to notice such trivial things as fun. They built
pyramids, Mayan temples, castles and dragons. One of the winners, Scale Models
Unlimited, built an elaborate zoo with caverns. Another group built a giant
hand holding a pencil. Another built a giant sandwich -- it looked yummy,
too.;    The most eloquent piece, undoubtedly, was <PERSON>Sam Smidt</PERSON>'s Res Ipsa
Loquitur -- "The Thing Speaks for Itself." It depicted a football field, where
toy soldiers stood in a football formation. When designer <PERSON>Sam Smidt</PERSON> heard
about the sand castle contest, he thought, "Geez, this is really an
opportunity to make a social statement.";    He had heard from a friend that
more people watched the gulf war than the <LOCATION>Superbowl</LOCATION>. Thus, the inspiration for
the anti-war sand sculpture. Perhaps the piece, which won the greatest
architectural marvel award, will inspire more "statement" sand castles next
year.;    After the contest, the clean up was no fun. It took the city crew
most of the weekend to shovel the sand onto a tractor, said organizer <PERSON>Susan

drought prohibited the crew from using water to wash away the sand.;  MOVIE

PENDRAGONS ESCAPE WITH 'BEST ILLUSIONISTS' AWARD; 
</P>
<P>
MAGIC: THE COUPLE ARE ELATED THAT JUDGES CHOSE THEM OVER DAVID COPPERFIELD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Pendragons are more than familiar with <PERSON>David Copperfield</PERSON>. As magic's top 
gun, <PERSON>Copperfield</PERSON> is the guy who fills arenas, does TV specials and is known for 
splashy, sometimes schmaltzy and almost always amazing tricks. 
</P>
<P>
Other illusionists routinely face performing in his shadow, including the 
Pendragons. But <PERSON>Jonathan</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Charlotte</LOCATION>, the former UC <LOCATION>Irvine</LOCATION> students turned 
husband-and-wife magic team, found more of the spotlight recently when they 
were named Best Illusionists in the <ORGANIZATION>International Magic Awards</ORGANIZATION> -- over 
<LOCATION>Copperfield</LOCATION> and several other performers. 
</P>
<P>
"We beat him!" <PERSON>Jonathan Pendragon</PERSON> said during a telephone interview from <LOCATION>Las 
Vegas</LOCATION>, where the couple were performing at the Aladdin hotel and casino. "I was 
excited, it's kind of amazing -- sort of like <PERSON>David</PERSON> and Goliath or <PERSON>Jack</PERSON> and the 
Giant Killer. 
</P>
<P>
"<PERSON>David</PERSON> (<ORGANIZATION>Copperfield</ORGANIZATION>) is visual and spectacular, but I think (the judges) were 
more interested in tradition. We like to keep it more straight, less 
sensational. The contest reflected, I think, more of a purist attitude." 
</P>
<P>
The two-hour-long competition, with categories including entertainers of the 
year (won by <LOCATION>Las Vegas</LOCATION> regulars Siegfried and Roy), best close-up performer, 
comedy magician, escape artist and technical magician (<ORGANIZATION>Copperfield</ORGANIZATION> did win this 
one), is scheduled to air <DATE>Monday</DATE> at <TIME>8 p.m.</TIME> on <ORGANIZATION>KTTV Channel 11</ORGANIZATION>. Winning 
routines, including the <PERSON>Pendragons</PERSON>' "Interlude" and "Metamorphosis," will be 
shown. 
</P>
<P>
Although reluctant to describe the illusions specifically, <ORGANIZATION>Pendragon</ORGANIZATION> said that 
<LOCATION>Charlotte</LOCATION> "appears to come through my chest" in "Interlude," while 
"Metamorphosis" involves "a rapid escape." 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Pendragon</ORGANIZATION> pointed out that both feats are typical of their approach, which 
involves a physical style utilizing his gymnastic and diving training (he's 
competed on the college level) and <LOCATION>Charlotte</LOCATION>'s experience as a dancer, gymnast 
and body builder (she was runner-up in the <DATE>1982</DATE> Body Building Superbowl 
contest). 
</P>
<P>
They avoid the gaudy costumes ("We hate rhinestones," he said) and the more 
traditional tuxedo garb ("It's too restrictive for the way we perform") favored 
by most magicians. Instead, they rely on scant, monotone outfits that allow 
movement and emphasize their physiques. 
</P>
<P>
Agility and quickness are integral to the act, which features levitations, 
disappearances and escapes, a <ORGANIZATION>Pendragon</ORGANIZATION> trademark. He said they hold the record 
for an escape from a locked trunk popularized by <PERSON>Harry Houdini</PERSON>, who did it in 
seven seconds. <ORGANIZATION>Pendragon</ORGANIZATION> does it in three. 
</P>
<P>
"There's drama in that because everyone is usually amazed when we accomplish it 
so soon. We combine our physical presence with an acting presence to create a 
style that adds to the illusions. 
</P>
<P>
"Besides, the rapidity is not purely for the sake of speed . . . a real 
magician would not stall; he would simply wave his hand and the magic would 
happen. As an actor, I try to make my magic look as real as possible." 
</P>
<P>
The Pendragons met in the late '70s while attending <ORGANIZATION>UCI</ORGANIZATION>, where <LOCATION>Charlotte</LOCATION> was 
studying dance, among other things, and <PERSON>Jonathan</PERSON> pursued drama. He was also 
performing solo in local and <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> clubs as a magician, when not 
moonlighting as a Hollywood stuntman (he's doubled for <PERSON>Burgess Meredith</PERSON> and 
<PERSON>John Belushi</PERSON>, among others). <LOCATION>Charlotte</LOCATION>, too, was a double, having appeared on 
"Charlie's Angels" and "Quincy, <LOCATION>M.E.</LOCATION>" They started dating, and eventually he 
asked her to take part in his act. 
</P>
<P>
At first, they offered the basics, using "manipulation and other standard 
tricks" but soon turned to a more physical style to set them apart. He also 
wanted to make <LOCATION>Charlotte</LOCATION> more than a pretty assistant and began building a 
routine around their equal partnership. 
</P>
<P>
They progressed rapidly. Although they haven't achieved the household fame of 
<ORGANIZATION>Copperfield</ORGANIZATION> and, before him, <PERSON>Doug Henning</PERSON>, the Pendragons are reasonably 
well-known among magic fans. Their work in <LOCATION>Las Vegas</LOCATION>, the acknowledged mecca 
for working magicians, the past few years and various appearances on television 
underscores that. 
</P>
<P>
In talking about magic, <ORGANIZATION>Pendragon</ORGANIZATION> is apt to get a little philosophical, 
referring to its "preternatural" beauty and ability to be "intellectually 
puzzling." Artistry and sound technique add up to good magic, which comes down 
to "telling a story and tapping into the kid in us." 
</P>
<P>
After a pause, he added that the best illusion "when performed expertly and 
with imagination can instill those lost feelings of youth and wonder that are 
rare and thrilling." 
</P>
<P>
 "The International Magic Awards," featuring the Pendragons, is scheduled to 
air <DATE>Monday</DATE> at <TIME>8 p.m.</TIME> on <ORGANIZATION>KTTV Channel 11</ORGANIZATION>.

RECENT <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> Knicks' basketball games at <ORGANIZATION>Madison Square Garden</ORGANIZATION> have been
a bit like a night at the <LOCATION>Oscars</LOCATION>, so hungry has Hollywood-on-the-Hudson been
to associate itself with the best sports story in town.
In recent weeks, <PERSON>Jack</PERSON>, Dusty, <LOCATION>Woody</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Spike</PERSON> and <PERSON>Arnold</PERSON> have all been there,
tasting the special atmosphere that <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> generates every time it looks
as if one of the city's teams is on the verge of greatness. When the
baseball Mets won the World Series in <DATE>1986</DATE>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> went berserk, as it did
the last time the Knicks won a championship, in <DATE>1973</DATE>.
Yet since the mid-1980s, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> sports fans have had little to cheer. The
football Giants won the SuperBowl in <DATE>1991</DATE>, but the title was earned against
the backdrop of the Gulf War, so celebrations were muted.
This year, however, the Knicks have captured the city's imagination. In the
regular season they won 60 of their 82 games, ending with the second best
record in the 27-team <ORGANIZATION>National Basketball Association</ORGANIZATION>.
To success-starved <LOCATION>New Yorkers</LOCATION>, the Knicks' performance has been especially
gratifying because it was only two years ago that the team seemed mired in
mediocrity.
In <DATE>1991</DATE> they scraped into the playoffs, only to go out at the first attempt
to the <ORGANIZATION>Chicago Bulls</ORGANIZATION> in three straight games. That poor effort disgusted the
fans and the local media. The season ended in complete disarray. The coach
lacked the support of his team and the <PERSON>Knicks</PERSON>' only star, <PERSON>Patrick Ewing</PERSON>,
wanted to escape <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>.
Yet, just <DATE>two years later</DATE>, the Knicks are fancied to reach the play-off
finals. They have beaten the <ORGANIZATION>Indiana Pacers</ORGANIZATION> in the first round and start
their second-round series against the <LOCATION>Charlotte</LOCATION> Hornets tomorrow.
Much of the credit for the Knicks' renaissance must go to <PERSON>Pat Riley</PERSON>, the
team's coach. In the <DATE>1980s</DATE> <PERSON>Riley</PERSON> coached the <LOCATION>Los Angeles Lakers</LOCATION> to five <ORGANIZATION>NBA</ORGANIZATION>
titles, but when he joined the Knicks at the start of the <DATE>1991-92</DATE> season
there were many who still believed he had not proved himself.
Critics argued that the Lakers were so good that it did not matter who
coached them. They said that a team led by legends like <PERSON>Kareem Abdul Jabbar</PERSON>
and Earvin 'Magic' <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> would have won five championships if they had
been coached by <PERSON>Michael Jackson</PERSON>. In the Knicks, <PERSON>Riley</PERSON> saw an opportunity to
win the respect that was denied him in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>.
Today, <PERSON>Riley</PERSON> has triumphed, and with a team that could not be more different
to his title-winners of the <DATE>1980s</DATE>. The Lakers dominated through deft
ball-handling and passing, and swift counter-attacks. They were adored by
their fans in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, who liked to think that the team played the game
the way they lived - creative, fast and loose.
The Knicks' have won the hearts of their city because their approach meshes
closely with <ORGANIZATION>New Yorkers</ORGANIZATION>' image of themselves - hardworking, tough and
uncompromising.
Above all, the <ORGANIZATION>Knicks</ORGANIZATION>' game is built around big men, aggressive defending,
and an intimidating attitude that occasionally borders on thuggery.
Their bruising style has made the Knicks the most feared team in the league,
and hugely popular in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. It is not surprising that the fans'
favourites this year have been <PERSON>Anthony Mason</PERSON> and <PERSON>John Starks</PERSON>, two ferocious
competitors whose intensely physical play causes havoc when they defend, and
creates scoring opportunities when the ball moves up court.
The dark side of streetfighters like <PERSON>Mason</PERSON> and <PERSON>Starks</PERSON> sometimes surfaces.
The Knicks' have a poor disciplinary record. On <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> <PERSON>Starks</PERSON> was thrown
out of a play-off game for head-butting <PERSON>Reggie Miller</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Pacers</ORGANIZATION>.
The other <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> weapons include the dominant presence under the basket
and the accurate shooting (especially under pressure) of <PERSON>Ewing</PERSON>, the canny
generalship of point guard <PERSON>Doc Rivers</PERSON> and the strongest substitutes' bench
in the <ORGANIZATION>NBA</ORGANIZATION>. Add <PERSON>Riley</PERSON>'s long experience of post-season play, and the Knicks
look as if they have the ingredients for a championship.
Yet, over such a long haul - the playoffs do not end until <DATE>June</DATE> and the
final three rounds involve a best-of-seven series - it may come down to
which team is hungriest for the title.
After consecutive championships, <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>'s appetite may be sated. The best
teams in the western division - <LOCATION>Phoenix</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Seattle</LOCATION> - have the talent, but
there are doubts over their willingness to mix it up with the toughest teams
from the east.
Furthermore, the Knicks are desperate to win. Ewing, who has won national
college championships and Olympic gold, has said he will not feel fulfilled
until he wins an <ORGANIZATION>NBA</ORGANIZATION> title. Veterans such as <PERSON>Rolando Blackman</PERSON> and <PERSON>Rivers</PERSON>
know this may be their last shot at glory, and <PERSON>Riley</PERSON> wants to prove he can
win it all with a team other than the <ORGANIZATION>Lakers</ORGANIZATION>.
As for <PERSON>Mason</PERSON> and <PERSON>Starks</PERSON>, they have reached the top the hard way - via the
basketball wilderness of semi-professional leagues, obscure European
leagues, and no-hope 10-day contracts with losing NBA teams. As <PERSON>Starks</PERSON> said
recently: 'Remember, I wasn't supposed to be in the pros. But once I got a
taste, I knew it was just a matter of time.'

<TEXT>
   ``I'm in a grumpy mood <DATE>today</DATE>,'' President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>
groused <DATE>Monday</DATE>, complaining he had eaten too much <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> barbecue at
a Superbowl party.
   ``No answers today. I'm trying to think of answers and (I'm
getting) too many questions,'' he said as reporters asked him about
the <MONEY>$1.23 trillion</MONEY> budget plan he unveiled for the fiscal year
beginning <DATE>Oct. 1</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> talked about his bad mood during a picture-taking ceremony
in the <ORGANIZATION>Oval Office</ORGANIZATION> with visiting British Foreign Secretary <PERSON>Douglas
Hurd</PERSON>.
   Brushing off the press as he normally does at photo
opportunities, <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> said, ``I ate too much yesterday and I just
don't feel like answering any questions. And besides that, it
violates the groundrules to answer any questions.''
   He allowed as how he sometimes does answer, but ``only when we
want to answer questions.''
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> and his wife <PERSON>Barbara</PERSON> had about a dozen people in <DATE>Sunday</DATE> to
watch the <LOCATION>Superbowl</LOCATION>, and served barbecue from Ft. Worth.
   While saying he had overindulged, <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> quickly added, ``I don't
want to get any rumors started about my physical condition.
   ``I'm just grumpy. I don't want to talk about it.
   ``It was good,'' he concluded, talking about the food.

<HEAD>Ad Club Picks Federal Express ``Fast-Talker'' Ad As Best of '80s</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A <ORGANIZATION>Federal Express Co.</ORGANIZATION> commercial that featured
an incredibly fast-talking businessman was the best advertisement
of the <DATE>1980s</DATE>, according to a survey of the board of the ad trade
group The One Club.
   The Orwellian ``<DATE>1984</DATE>'' commercial for <ORGANIZATION>Apple Computer Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and a
series of Rolling Stone magazine print ads noting the differences
between some perceptions about its readers and reality also were
ranked among the best ads of the decade, the group said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
   Ads for <PERSON>Levi Strauss</PERSON>' jeans, <ORGANIZATION>Nike</ORGANIZATION> shoes, the wine coolers
<ORGANIZATION>Bartles &amp; Jaymes</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> Cooler and <PERSON>Miller Lite</PERSON> beer also
made the list.
   The One Club, an association of advertising copywriters and art
directors, developed its ranking based on responses to surveys in
which each of its 13 directors was asked to rank personal favorites
from the past decade.
   None of the directors' ad agencies placed an ad on the decade's
best list.
   Of the 12 best ads, 10 involved television commercials, one was
a print campaign and one used billboards.
   <PERSON>Mike Hughes</PERSON>, vice chairman and creative director of <ORGANIZATION>The Martin
Agency of Richmond</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Va.</LOCATION>, said the directors generally were trying
to identify ads that broke from convention and spawned imitators of
their own.
   But he said <DATE>1985</DATE> commercials for <PERSON>Levi</PERSON>'s 501 jeans, which showed
young people in urban settings cast in a blue-shaded hue, had a
style copied widely. ``A lot of commercials became blue,'' he said.
   <PERSON>Hughes</PERSON> said the top-rated ``Fast Talker'' ad from <ORGANIZATION>Federal
Express</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1982</DATE> brought activity to a halt in many households each
time the commercial aired.
   A separate <ORGANIZATION>Federal Express</ORGANIZATION> campaign from <DATE>1980</DATE> that showed top
executives anxious to get a package delivered picking up the phone
and saying ``Hello-o-o Federal'' broke the ad taboo of ``Never make
the customer look silly,'' <PERSON>Hughes</PERSON> said.
   Apple's ``<DATE>1984</DATE>'' ad showed a dreary scene of prisoners filing in
for a televised address by a dogmatic leader. The gloom was
shattered when a woman tossed a club that broke the screen. The ad
ran only once _ during the telecast of the <DATE>1984</DATE> Superbowl football
game _ but <PERSON>Hughes</PERSON> said no other ad has had more impact on one
airing.
   Authorship of a memorable ad in the <DATE>1980s</DATE> did not necessarily
mean an ad agency kept the assignment. Ally <ORGANIZATION>&amp; Gargano</ORGANIZATION>, which made
the two winning <ORGANIZATION>Federal Express</ORGANIZATION> ads, is no longer the <ORGANIZATION>Federal
Express</ORGANIZATION> agency, and <ORGANIZATION>Apple</ORGANIZATION> has dropped Chiat-Day, which made
``<DATE>1984</DATE>,'' as its agency.
   But Chiat-Day offices, now known as Chiat-Day-Mojo, were
responsible for five of the 12 best ads, according to the <ORGANIZATION>One Club</ORGANIZATION>
survey.
   Here is the list of best ads of the decade, the year and the
agency responsible for them, according to The One Club:
   1. <ORGANIZATION>Federal Express</ORGANIZATION>, ``Fast-Talker,'' <DATE>1982</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Ally &amp; Gargano</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>New
York</LOCATION>.
   2. Apple Computer, ``<DATE>1984</DATE>,'' <DATE>1984</DATE>, <LOCATION>Chiat-Day</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>
   3. Rolling Stone magazine, ``Perception-Reality Campaign,''
<DATE>1986</DATE>, <PERSON>Fallon McElligott</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Minneapolis</LOCATION>.
   4. <ORGANIZATION>Nynex</ORGANIZATION>, ``Dumbwaiters, Rock Drills, Furniture Stripping,''
<DATE>1988</DATE>, <LOCATION>Chiat-Day</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>.
   5. <ORGANIZATION>Bartles &amp; Jaymes</ORGANIZATION>, introductory TV campaign, <DATE>1986</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Hal Riney &amp;
Partners</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>.
   6. <PERSON>Levi Strauss</PERSON>, ``Gang, Blues Singer, Street Singer,'' <DATE>1985</DATE>,

<HEAD>SuperBowl Halftime Show, Diet Coke Ad to Be Broadcast in 3-D</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   <ORGANIZATION>Coca-Cola Co.</ORGANIZATION> has been stuck with 20 million
pairs of 3-D glasses ever since the last episode of ``Moonlighting''
was nixed last <DATE>spring</DATE> by the writers' strike. It says it just found
a super way to use them.
   The soft drink giant, the <ORGANIZATION>National Football League</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION>
announced <DATE>Monday</DATE> they would cooperate in a three-dimensional
broadcast of the 12-minute Super Bowl XXIII halftime show and a
45-second <ORGANIZATION>Diet Coke</ORGANIZATION> ad next month.
   The Atlanta-based company said its bottlers would distribute the
special glasses, which will enable fans to see the 3-D approach,
with purchases of <ORGANIZATION>Diet Coke</ORGANIZATION> in the two weeks before the <DATE>Jan. 22</DATE>
contest for the <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> championship.
   Coca-Cola ordered the glasses earlier this year after agreeing
with the ``Moonlighting'' producers that a commercial and a portion
of the final show of the 1987-88 season would be shot with the new
3-D technology.
   But the episode was canceled after the writers went on strike and
the <ORGANIZATION>Coca-Cola</ORGANIZATION> commercial never was made. Production of the glasses
was halted at 20 million and they were stored while <ORGANIZATION>Coca-Cola</ORGANIZATION> looked
for other TV showcases.
   Network executives said the halftime program would be the first
live 3-D broadcast on network television, and would continue <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION>'s
tradition of innovation in football coverage. <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION> broadcast a
``silent minute'' to give viewers a break from the Super Bowl
pre-game show in <DATE>1986</DATE> and aired an entire regular season game with
no announcers a few years ago.
   Viewers will need the glasses to get the 3-D effect, but a new
technology called Nuoptix 3-D, developed by <PERSON>Terry Beard</PERSON>, founder and
head of the <ORGANIZATION>Los-Angeles-based Nuoptix Associates Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, leaves the
picture normal for others.
   The patented process avoids the distortion or double-imaging of
the picture that the 3-D processes of the <DATE>1950s</DATE> caused for those
without special glasses.
   Not content to let a volley sound in the cola wars without
responding, <ORGANIZATION>Pepsi-Cola Co.</ORGANIZATION> announced separately <DATE>Monday</DATE> that its Diet
<ORGANIZATION>Pepsi</ORGANIZATION> brand has agreed to be the official sponsor of <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION>
player talent show to be broadcast before the big game. The talent
show will match <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> players in competition as singers, dancers and
comedians.
   Calling the announcement ``a surprise move,'' <ORGANIZATION>Pepsi</ORGANIZATION>'s executive
vice president of marketing and sales, <PERSON>Michael Lorelli</PERSON>, said ``Diet
<ORGANIZATION>Pepsi</ORGANIZATION>'s end-run on <ORGANIZATION>Diet Coke</ORGANIZATION> just signaled the start of an intense
off-the-field battle.''
   Asked about <ORGANIZATION>Pepsi</ORGANIZATION>'s announcement at the news conference where he
announced the deal with <ORGANIZATION>Coca-Cola</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>NBC Sports</ORGANIZATION> executive producer
<PERSON>Michael Weisman</PERSON> said the network had not settled sponsorship of the
pre-game talent show.
   But a <ORGANIZATION>Pepsi</ORGANIZATION> spokesman, <PERSON>Tod MacKenize</PERSON>, insisted that <ORGANIZATION>Pepsi-Cola</ORGANIZATION>
had returned a signed contract to <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION> <DATE>last week</DATE> and that the deal
was done.
   Coca-Cola, based in <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION>Pepsi-Cola</ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION>Somers</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>, dominate the <MONEY>$43.2 billion</MONEY> <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> soft drink business.
   Diet <ORGANIZATION>Coke</ORGANIZATION> is the best-selling diet soft drink and the third
biggest seller overall with about <PERCENT>8.2 percent</PERCENT> of the overall soft
drink market. Diet <ORGANIZATION>Pepsi</ORGANIZATION> ranks second in the category and fourth
overall at <PERCENT>5.2 percent</PERCENT>.
   The two soft drink giants are always on the lookout for splashy
new ways to boost anticipation of their commercials and get big
audiences for them.
   <PERSON>Michael Beindorff</PERSON>, vice president for advertising at <ORGANIZATION>Coca-Cola</ORGANIZATION>,
said he had been aproached with dozens of opportunities to showcase
a 3-D commercial, but rejected them until the Super Bowl opportunity
came along.
   ``This is not just a few minutes or a couple of special
effects,'' <PERSON>Beindorff</PERSON> said. ``It's not just pre-game fluff or a
post-game throwaway.''

   American vocalists <PERSON>Deborah Voigt</PERSON> and <PERSON>Hans Choi</PERSON>
today won top honors in the ninth international Tchaikovsky musical
competition.
   Akiko Suwanai of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> took first place in the violin section of
the contest, <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Gustav Rivinius</PERSON> won the gold medal for
cello, and Soviet <PERSON>Boris Berezovski</PERSON> took first place for piano,
contest officials said.
   The Tchaikovsky competition has been held every four years since
<DATE>1958</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Alyssa Park</PERSON>, a 16-year-old violinist from <LOCATION>Lexington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ky.</LOCATION>, came
in third and received three medals, for third place, for most
talented performer and for most artistic performer.
   ``I was very honored, but also very puzzled,'' she said later,
noting the international jury awarded her medals for most artistic
and most talented, but then only gave her third place.
   She admitted feeling some tension. ``But I just tried to treat
it as a concert and play,'' she said.
   Ten Americans were among the 48 finalists competing for gold
medals <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>.
   ``This is the superbowl of musical competition,'' said <PERSON>Daniel
Pollack</PERSON>, a competitor in the piano competion in <DATE>1958</DATE> and now a jury
member.
   <PERSON>Ms. Voigt</PERSON>, 29, a former apprentice with the <ORGANIZATION>San Francisco Opera
Company</ORGANIZATION>, won the gold medal for best female vocalist. She lives in
<LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>.
   Before the contest, <PERSON>Ms. Voigt</PERSON> said she wanted to win because the
Tchaikovsky competition is the best known in the world and can give
a singing career an immediate boost.
   ``The amount of publicity a singer can get here is more than I
could pay.''
   Choi, a former student at the La Scala opera company of <LOCATION>Milan</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>, got the gold medal for male vocalist. He has lived in the
<LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> for two years and currently resides in <LOCATION>Flushing</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>
   During the competition, he said the biggest problem was
language. ``I must sing in six languages, and I must sing perfectly
in six languanges, because the judges come from so many countries.''

<LEADPARA>  BUFFALO, N.Y. It's a dateline. It's a football game. No, it's SuperBowl, and
that means I have to make a prediction.;    I hate making predictions. But I
like the Giants.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Sports  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  TAKE GIANTS OUTRIGHT  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     I like the <ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION> to win Super Bowl XXV over the <LOCATION>Buffalo Bills</LOCATION>. Take the
points -- the Giants are getting seven -- but you won't need them, and neither
will the <ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION>. They'll win outright.;    The perspective on this matchup has
been severely skewed by <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION>'s 51-3 rout of the <ORGANIZATION>Los Angeles Raiders</ORGANIZATION> last
<DATE>Sunday</DATE>. Oh, it was impressive. So was the Bills' 44-34 beating of <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> <DATE>a week
earlier</DATE>. In two playoff games, the Bills have 95 points and nearly 1,000 yards
in offense.;    But today, the Bills aren't playing in <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION>. They aren't
playing a warm-weather team in a cold, windy stadium. They are playing against
a defense the likes of which they have not seen, except for once. On <DATE>Dec. 15</DATE>,
the Bills played the <ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION> and beat them 17-13.;    "THAT was our worst
game," Giants safety <PERSON>Dave Duerson</PERSON> said last week. It was a statement, not an
excuse.;    "We stunk," said Coach Bill Parcells.;    <PERSON>Parcells</PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION>
stunk in two areas, specifically: short-yardage offense, and tackling. Indeed,
videotape shows 11 missed tackles by the <ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION>, resulting in 153 additional
yards for the Bills.;    It would be dangerous to put too much emphasis on
that <DATE>Dec. 15</DATE> game. A lot has changed in six weeks. Buffalo quarterback <PERSON>Jim
Kelly</PERSON>, injured in that game, has returned. <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> quarterback <PERSON>Phil Simms</PERSON>,
also injured that day, has not. But <PERSON>Jeff Hostetler</PERSON> has shown heart and
ability, and whatever the <ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION> lose by not having <PERSON>Simms</PERSON> -- if they lose
anything at all -- is offset by two more differences from the <DATE>Dec. 15</DATE>
meeting:;    First, this game will be played on grass, where the Bills are 2-5
the last two seasons.;    Second, this is the Super Bowl, where no Bills
player has ever been. Granted, the hype has been extraordinarily small. Cut in
half by the schedule and reduced further by events in the <LOCATION>Persian Gulf</LOCATION>, this
might be the least-hyped Super Bowl in the <DATE>last 20 years.</DATE>;    But when the
players step on the field today, they'll know where they are and they'll feel
the height of the stakes. The Giants have been here before -- 25 of them,
including Parcells.;    To many of the "experts" at the Super Bowl, <PERSON>Parcells</PERSON>
is the <ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION>' only chance. I don't know. Ever since that night at <LOCATION>Candlestick
Park</LOCATION>, when <PERSON>Parcells</PERSON> went for broke on fourth-and-goal from the 9, I've
wondered about the genius tag he wears.;    But <PERSON>Marv Levy</PERSON> is in a panic, they
say. He's tight. As evidence, they cite his decision to change hotels in
<LOCATION>Tampa</LOCATION>. Heck, that wasn't panic; that was a great move. You don't come to the
Super Bowl to stay at a Holiday Inn.;    Levy has done a tremendous job. The
Bickering Bills are now the Super Bowl Bills. They've got the no-huddle
offense. They've got the league's most-balanced offense. They've got <PERSON>Thurman
Thomas</PERSON>, a great running back. They've got <PERSON>Kelly</PERSON>, a fine quarterback.;    But,
in football, good hitting beats good pitching.;    <ORGANIZATION>The Giants</ORGANIZATION>' defense is No.
1 in fewest points allowed, No. 2 in yards allowed, No. 4 against the run and
No. 6 against the pass. Only one back has rushed for more than 100 yards
against the <ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION>, and it wasn't Thurman Thomas. (<LOCATION>Phoenix</LOCATION> rookie <PERSON>Johnny
Johnson</PERSON> ran for 108; <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON> had 60 yards -- in 21 carries -- in the <DATE>Dec. 15</DATE>
game.);    The Giants are tough, and they're smart. They've got a plan to
counteract the no-huddle offense. They've also got <PERSON>Lawrence Taylor</PERSON>. He can
still dominate a game, and you might see that today. He sees this as possibly
his last Super Bowl. He is a man possessed.;    And, of course, the Bills
can't score if they don't have the ball. Against the 49ers <DATE>last Sunday</DATE>, the
<LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> offense controlled the ball for almost 40 minutes. It was a 40-20
split the week before against <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>, too.;    There's no reason to think the
<ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION> can't do that against the Bills. They already have, in fact; the <ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION>
controlled the ball for 37 minutes, 59 seconds of that <DATE>Dec. 15</DATE> game. The Bills
rank 15th against the run.;    If this game comes down to a field goal, who do
you like: <PERSON>Matt Bahr</PERSON> or <PERSON>Scott Norwood</PERSON>? If it's a punting contest, you've got to
like the <ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION>' <PERSON>Sean Landeta.</PERSON>;    See, you can find a dozen reasons to like
the <ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION>. But you need only one, really, and it's the one I woke up with
<DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME>: These guys stopped <LOCATION>Joe Montana</LOCATION> twice. That's enough for me.  </TEXT>

One of the chief differences so far between this and other recent Super Bowl 
weeks is the widespread lack of support for the <ORGANIZATION>American Football Conference</ORGANIZATION> 
entry here next <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, the <LOCATION>Cincinnati Bengals</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody I've read or run into is picking the (<LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>) 49ers," <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> 
Cowboys President <PERSON>Tex Schramm</PERSON> said <DATE>Sunday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never seen such unanimity despite the fact that <LOCATION>Cincinnati</LOCATION> has a better 
shot, in my opinion, than a lot of other (<DATE>1980s</DATE>) AFC teams." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the last 4 winters, when quarterbacks such as <PERSON>John Elway</PERSON> and <PERSON>Dan Marino</PERSON> 
appeared to give AFC teams a solid chance, <LOCATION>Cincinnati</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Boomer Esiason</PERSON> and the 
Bengals' 15th-ranked defense don't seem -- in the view of most observers -- to 
be a match for <PERSON>Joe Montana</PERSON> and the third-ranked 49er defense. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll give you one prediction," <PERSON>Schramm</PERSON> said. "If the 49ers agree (with the 
majority view), they'll lose. This is a game of the mind. Nobody's invincible 
if you think you are. 
</P>
<P>
The Bengals, first to arrive for the 23rd renewal of the series, began workouts 
<DATE>Sunday</DATE> afternoon at the <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> Dolphins practice facility, which will be their 
home away from a freezing home this week. 
</P>
<P>
Coach <PERSON>Sam Wyche</PERSON>, who closed the practice to the public, reported no new 
injuries or illness. 
</P>
<P>
Coach <PERSON>Bill Walsh</PERSON> acknowledged <DATE>Sunday</DATE> that he has thought about stepping down as 
49er coach next season, but said he will remain with the team no matter what he 
decides. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to remain with the 49ers, quite possibly in the same capacity," 
<PERSON>Walsh</PERSON> said, shortly after arriving with the team in <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"When you coach 30 years, you have to look pretty seriously at your life and 
career. But there are other times when you say, 'I can't give it up. It's what 
I do.' " 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Walsh</PERSON> said he would decide soon after the Super Bowl whether to stay as coach 
or move to an executive capacity. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Eddie DeBartolo</PERSON>, the 49er owner, surprised <PERSON>Walsh</PERSON> and team by acting as the 
hotel doorman when they arrived in <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't realize it was him. I didn't have time to tip him," said <PERSON>Walsh</PERSON>, whose 
team will begin practice at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Miami</ORGANIZATION> today. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Wayne Sevier</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>San Diego Chargers</ORGANIZATION> assistant who coached in this game with the 
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> Redskins in <DATE>1983</DATE>, is among the football people who reason that it 
was bad luck for <PERSON>Wyche</PERSON> and his no-huddle offense that they drew the 49ers and 
Coach <PERSON>Bill Walsh</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Cincinnati</LOCATION>'s first Super Bowl since <DATE>1982</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
"<PERSON>Walsh</PERSON> will have a (defensive) plan for the no-huddle, you can count on that," 
<PERSON>Sevier</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, with 225-pound strong safety <PERSON>Jeff Fuller</PERSON> in the <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> 
lineup, the 49ers can make a conventional alignment look like the nickel 
defense, or vice versa, <PERSON>Sevier</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
"Fuller is as solid against the run as he is active against the pass," the <LOCATION>San 
Diego</LOCATION> coach added. "He's bigger than (49er linebacker) <PERSON>Keena Turner</PERSON>, who lists 
at 222." 
</P>
<P>
Fuller is listed at 216, though his opponents doubt that he was that small 10 
or 15 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"(Against no-huddle formations) a big safety like Fuller is a tremendous asset 
to a team like the 49ers," <PERSON>Sevier</PERSON> said. "I mean, when big (<LOCATION>Cincinnati</LOCATION> fullback) 
<PERSON>Ickey Woods</PERSON> is running against a little safety in the ordinary nickel, it's a 
mismatch. Fuller changes that dimension. 
</P>
<P>
"It's similar with (<LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> linebacker) <PERSON>Charles Haley</PERSON>, who can be either 
a down lineman or a linebacker. The no-huddle offense loses a lot of its 
effectiveness against multiple-formation players like Fuller and <PERSON>Haley</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
"The 49ers don't have to worry about bringing in defensive specialists. They're 
already on the field." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Sid Gillman</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>Hall of Famer</ORGANIZATION> who used to coach the Rams and other <ORGANIZATION>National 
Football League</ORGANIZATION> teams, is no fan of the no-huddle attack in any case. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a haphazard way to run an offense, with people running around out there 
shouting at other people," <PERSON>Gillman</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
"Besides, if it's third and 5, I'm going to send in an extra cornerback, 
anyhow, no-huddle or not." 
</P>
<P>
Sevier, who is a candidate for at least one of the coaching vacancies that have 
materialized in the <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> <DATE>this winter</DATE>, expects a relatively penalty-free Super 
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Though the referees throw a lot of flags each fall in the regular season, they 
normally restrain themselves in the championship game. 
</P>
<P>
As Sevier sees it, there are three reasons for this: 
</P>
<P>
"First, you get a better quality team in the Super Bowl," he said. "Good teams 
make fewer fouls. 
</P>
<P>
"Second, these are the <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION>'s best officials of the year. Like Super Bowl 
players, they're at the very top of their game, or they wouldn't be here, and 
they don't want an official's call to be the difference. So they make sure that 
anything they call, they actually see. 
</P>
<P>
"Officials are like the rest of us, and in a hum-drum game in the regular 
season they're more subject to bad calls. 
</P>
<P>
"Third, Super Bowl officials, being the best at their profession, are less 
likely than other officials to call clipping on a kick return. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the penalty that is most often not a foul. And it comes when blocking 
angles are changed after the kick returner changes direction. 
</P>
<P>
"Returners run to a designated point of attack -- but if the kicking team shuts 
them down there, they're coached to run (elsewhere) to daylight. This sets up 
unforeseen blocking angles. 
</P>
<P>
"What would have been a good block becomes a push in the back -- and the 
official drops his handkerchief. In the regular season, I mean, they do. 
</P>
<P>
"You're less likely to see that in the Super Bowl." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Joe Browne</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> said TV surveys show that <PERCENT>40%</PERCENT> of those viewing Super Bowl 
XXIII on home television will be women. 
</P>
<P>
"That's more than double the number of women who usually watch a sports event," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Eleven <LOCATION>South Florida</LOCATION> taxi drivers, serving on something called the Super Bowl 
'89 Taxi Squad, are acting as role models in <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> this week for other drivers. 
</P>
<P>
It's part of a <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> Nice campaign. 
</P>
<P>
The drivers were trained in courtesy and other welcome virtues at <ORGANIZATION>St. Thomas 
University</ORGANIZATION> nearby. Many <LOCATION>Dade County</LOCATION> taxi drivers are wearing welcome-to-Miami 
Super Bowl hats and shirts funded by a <MONEY>$50,000</MONEY> grant from a <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> 
corporation. 
</P>
<P>
It remains to be seen if the improvements are cosmetic or otherwise, but fares 
in <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> do seem more reasonable. 
</P>
<P>
Unless he changes his mind, <PERSON>Alvin Garrett</PERSON>'s ring from the <DATE>1983</DATE> Super Bowl is 
going to the highest bidder. In an auction of sorts, the former <ORGANIZATION>Washington 
Redskins</ORGANIZATION> wide receiver has taken out a classified ad in <ORGANIZATION>The Washington Post</ORGANIZATION> in 
hopes of selling the ring, according to a Post story. 
</P>
<P>
The going price is undetermined, although <PERSON>Garrett</PERSON> said <PERSON>Friday</PERSON> <MONEY>$50,000</MONEY> is a 
nice, round figure. Early callers are stuck at about <MONEY>$20,000</MONEY>. 
</P>
<P>
"That wouldn't be enough," he said. "We're just starting it off. It'll climb." 
</P>
<P>
The ad began running in the Post this week under "Antiques and Collectibles" 
and reads, "COLLECTOR'S ITEM -- <DATE>1982</DATE> Redskins World Champ Superbowl ring. Very 
valuable &amp; rare oppty." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Garrett</PERSON> said he has been unemployed for a month or two and that he needs the 
money. "I thought about this since a long time ago," he said. "I guess you have 
to be me to understand. It's just a ring. When I got it, it was good to have, 
but there's more to life than a gold band and a diamond. . . . You need to have 
enough money to have shelter, a car to drive, food to eat."

<HEAD>Gulf Crisis Sends Tokyo Markets Reeling</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq's invasion of <LOCATION>Kuwait</LOCATION> sent the already bearish
<LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> stock market plummeting, and traders said the trend is likely
to continue.
   The dollar-yen exchange rate, meanwhile, settled into a range of
around 147 to <MONEY>148 yen</MONEY> to the dollar after major fluctuations early
in the crisis.
   Analysts predicted that the strength of the Japanese economy,
and the relative weakness of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> economy, would keep the
exchange rate hovering around the same level until the <LOCATION>Middle East</LOCATION>
stalemate breaks.
   <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>'s stock traders were already seven months into a bear
market by <DATE>Aug. 2</DATE>, when Iraqi troops overtook <LOCATION>Kuwait</LOCATION>. The market,
which had been near the 31,000-point level, immediately plunged
nearly 600 points.
   The next two weeks brought new shocks.
   The first was <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s decision a few days after the invasion to
impose unpredented strict sanctions on <ORGANIZATION>Iraq</ORGANIZATION>, followed by the <ORGANIZATION>United
Nations</ORGANIZATION>' decision to impose sanctions.
   The second was Prime Minister <PERSON>Toshiki Kaifu</PERSON>'s decision the
following <DATE>Monday</DATE> to cancel his long-planned tour of five <ORGANIZATION>Middle
Eastern</ORGANIZATION> countries, scheduled to begin <DATE>Aug. 15</DATE>.
   Also during the second full week of <DATE>August</DATE>, the traditional
``O-bon'' holiday, beautiful weather and the distraction of the
national high school baseball tournament, combined to weaken
interest in all markets, traders said.
   On <DATE>Friday</DATE>, the 225-issue <ORGANIZATION>Nikkei Stock Average</ORGANIZATION> closed at
26,786.72 points, down <PERCENT>13 percent</PERCENT> from its <DATE>Aug. 1</DATE> close.
   Traders said the market would continue to slide.
   ``The most likely scenario for the stock market right now is to
weaken further,'' said <PERSON>Pelham Smithers</PERSON>, an analyst for <ORGANIZATION>Shearson,
Lehman</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Hutton Asia, Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, citing weakness in the bond market along
with uncertainty about the Iraq-Kuwait situation as influences.
   Low yields on the stock market, he said, ``have made other
instruments, such as holding cash, more attractive.''
   Long-term interest rates on bonds, for instance, started going
up in <DATE>June</DATE>, when <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> agreed to spend some <MONEY>$2.72 billion</MONEY> on public
works over the next 10 years, he said. The yield of the benchmark
10-year Japanese government bond closed <DATE>Friday</DATE> at <PERCENT>8.050 percent</PERCENT>, up
from <PERCENT>7.505 percent</PERCENT> on <DATE>Aug. 1</DATE>.
   The market has been on a long-term downswing since <DATE>Dec. 29</DATE>, when
the latest postwar ``Superbowl'' market peaked at 38,916 points,
said <PERSON>Darrel Whitten</PERSON>, director of research at the <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> office of
<ORGANIZATION>Prudential Bache Securities</ORGANIZATION>.
   Superbowl markets, when markets typically expanded by about <PERCENT>5.5
percent</PERCENT>, have been followed by corrections averaging 80 to 90
months, he said. ``The question is how long the adjustment will
last.''
   Another indicator, the five-year moving average, suggests the
market will bottom out at 25,000-21,000 points, he said.
   With higher oil prices killing any chance of bringing interest
rates down, and corporate profits unlikely to go up, ``The blow-off
comes in the market,'' he said.
   Early in the crisis, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s near total dependence on imported
oil buoyed the dollar.
   Brent Crude for <DATE>October</DATE> delivery closed <DATE>Friday</DATE> at about <MONEY>$26.10</MONEY>
to <MONEY>$26.20</MONEY> a barrel in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>, compared with <MONEY>$19.90</MONEY> to <MONEY>$21.00</MONEY> a
barrel in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> on <DATE>Aug. 1</DATE>.
   But eventually the markets valued the yen higher because of
<LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s economic strength. Although the dollar normally gains
strength in times of crisis, the structural weaknesses of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
economy has overwhelmed its traditional strength in times of
crisis, many traders said.
   <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> has been working since the first oil shocks of the early
<DATE>1970s</DATE> to broaden its list of suppliers and lessen its dependence on
oil imports through efficiency and use of other energy sources,
notably nuclear, they said.
   ``The yen appears to have settled temporarily into a trading
range against the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> dollar and the <LOCATION>Deutschemark</LOCATION>, and the earlier
pattern of dollar weakness is not expected to re-emerge until the
<LOCATION>Middle East</LOCATION> situation is clarified,'' said analysts at <ORGANIZATION>Salomon
Brothers Asia, Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, in a newsletter prepared for the week of <DATE>Aug.
13</DATE>.
   The dollar closed at <MONEY>147.35 yen</MONEY> to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> dollar <DATE>Friday</DATE>. On
<DATE>Aug. 2</DATE>, the currency jumped <MONEY>2.25 yen</MONEY> to <MONEY>147.13 yen</MONEY>. Closing figures
bounced between <MONEY>149 yen</MONEY> and <MONEY>150 yen</MONEY> but no higher than <MONEY>150.65 yen</MONEY>
in subsequent days.
   With energy prices already high, oil and utility company profits
would cushion the Japanese economy, while the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> economy
is struggling under numerous burdens, added analyst <PERSON>Robert A
Feldman</PERSON>.

FT  25 JUN 94 / As They Say in Europe: Passion that eludes the US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last <DATE>weekend</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>La Gazzetta Sportiva</ORGANIZATION> said: 'E non si puo neppure imprecare alla
sfortuna' (one cannot even blame misfortune). This observation on the defeat
at the hands, or feet, of <LOCATION>Ireland</LOCATION> in the World Cup, could have been taken
from a barely-known opera by Puccini which I have unearthed - <PERSON>Il Fanciullo</PERSON>
del Ouest (The Boy of the Golden West).
The hero, <LOCATION>Chicherino</LOCATION>, sings this sad aria, E non si puo, having been forced
to emigrate and take up American football after scoring a last-minute own
goal in a European cup match against <ORGANIZATION>Lammermoor United</ORGANIZATION>. He was also rejected
by his beloved Calcia. She sings L'Italia sprofonda nel grigiore (<LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>
plunged in gloom - quoted on page 3 of Sportiva) when he scores an historic
touchdown in the <LOCATION>Superbowl</LOCATION> <DATE>a year later</DATE>.
But not all <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> was plunged in gloom at the defeat. For the opponents of
<PERSON>Silvio Berlusconi</PERSON>, the country's new leader, there was covert rejoicing.
Berlusconi owns AC <LOCATION>Milan</LOCATION> and their players constitute the largest element in
the Italian team. La Repubblica headlined the surprise defeat: '<LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>, in
the shape of <LOCATION>Milan</LOCATION>, beaten.'
So, <LOCATION>Ireland</LOCATION>, in the shape of <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>, won; nine of the team were born in
places such as <ORGANIZATION>Ealing</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> suburb.
There was one other country which enjoyed a startling victory <DATE>last weekend</DATE> -
<LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION>. That again was an odd case of foreigners, at least a sort of
foreigner, playing a crucial role. In the match against <LOCATION>Colombia</LOCATION>, which
brought tears of admiration, there was a wondrous goal by <PERSON>Gheorghe Hagi</PERSON>. The
commentators spent much of the rest of the game arguing as to whether he
could have meant it. (He did because he had done it before.)
Hagi turns out to be an Aromanian, a small group from <LOCATION>Macedonia</LOCATION> which speaks
an odd form of Romanian. He is a man of few words in that language, just
saying: 'Keep your fingers crossed,' to the mass circulation Evenimentul
Zilei in its attempt to extract an interview.
<LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION>'s other goals were scored by <PERSON>Florin Raducioiu</PERSON>, who was positively
prolix by comparison, observing that the 3-1 victory was compensation for
having kept his compatriots up all night. The <LOCATION>Bucharest</LOCATION> fiesta began at
around four in the <TIME>morning local time</TIME>, the first occasion for national
rejoicing since <PERSON>Mr</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mrs Ceausescu</PERSON> were shot on <DATE>Christmas Day, 1989</DATE>.
Evenimentul carried an even more unusual World Cup story. In the middle of
the small knot of Romanian supporters at the <LOCATION>Pasadena</LOCATION> Rose Bowl was an
emotional Dutch woman waving their national flag. Asked what she was doing
there, she replied: 'I am Astrid, wife of <ORGANIZATION>Raducioiu</ORGANIZATION>,' which sounds
suspiciously like something stolen from a Dutch-Romanian phrase book. The
star striker had, it emerged, secretly married her three days before.
There has been Europe-wide speculation as to whether the host nation will
become interested in what the rest of the world calls football. The
consensus is that it will not - and that is no bad thing.
No one liked the opening ceremony. La Stampa was the most favourable, saying
it was 'simple, fast and cheap'. Another Italian paper, <LOCATION>Tuttosport</LOCATION>, said the
only good thing was that it was short, while Sport in <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> said the contest
opened with a 'grey, grim and short celebration'.
A French paper, La Nouvelle Republique du Centre-Ouest, pondered how a
country that had exported its culture to the rest of the world, and was
largely made up of European immigrants, had remained closed to football.
'America loves violent sports and high scores. It hates drawn games. It
prefers by far the organised progression towards the opposing goal to a
subtle combination made up of fantasy and improvisation . . . Perhaps
passions are not as universal as one would like to think.'
Soccer could become a mass sport in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> if the game abandoned the offside
rule, doubled the size of the goal, stopped every five minutes for bogus
reasons and employed teams made up of genetic curiosities. It would not be
soccer but it would appeal to TV networks and advertisers. For they will
never accept the game of football as it is known to the rest of the world.

<HEAD>Ninth International Tchaikovsky Musical Competition Ends</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN IAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The prestigious Tchaikovsky competition drew to a
close today with final performances by 48 musicians, including 10
Americans.
   Musicians were competing for the top prize in four categories:
piano, violin, and _ for the first time since the event was
initially held in <DATE>1958</DATE> _ voice and cello.
   Called the ``superbowl of musical competition,'' by one judge,
the Tchaikovsky competition is held every four years.
   The competition, which began <DATE>June 14</DATE>, drew 335 competitors from
51 countries, organizers said. Winners were to be announced <DATE>Friday</DATE>.
   The top musicians in each category receive a <MONEY>$4,000</MONEY> streo
system, a gold medal and 5,000 rubles _ a non-convertible currency
that cannot be taken from the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>.
   ``This is the most important competition in the world,'' said
finalist <PERSON>Hans Choi</PERSON>, 31, a South Korean-born singer who lives in <LOCATION>New
York City</LOCATION>. ``I must sing perfctly in six languanges because the
judges come from so many countries.''
   This year, for the first time, not only are the contestants and
judges international, but the sponsorship as well. The hard-pressed
Soviet hosts turned to a Japanese company to donate the stereo
equipment offered as prizes.
   <PERSON>Deborah Voigt</PERSON>, 29, a singer who lives in <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION>, said the
Soviet audiences had been very supportive.
   ``I am a bit overwhelmed. The audience response has been
unbelievable,'' she said. ``I used to think Italians were the best
audiences, but now I think Russians make the best audience by far.''
   The contest spokeswoman, <PERSON>Galina Tyurina</PERSON>, said the four halls
where the competition has been held were filled to capacity for
each performance.
   ``We have nothing but empty shelves in our shops,'' said
<PERSON>Tyurina</PERSON>, ``but we love our music. There is no shortage of music in
our country.''
   <PERSON>Lucia Lin</PERSON>, a 28-year-old violinist from <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>, said she came to
<LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> because of the competition's reputation. Lin plays with the
<ORGANIZATION>Boston Symphony Orchestra</ORGANIZATION>. ``It's a lot of work _ stressful and
grueling _ but I'm glad I came,'' she said.
   The Tchaikovsky competition is organized by the <ORGANIZATION>Ministry of
Culture</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Union of Composers</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>All-Union Music Society</ORGANIZATION>.

interview with <PERSON>Howard Cosell</PERSON> by answering unwelcome questions with expletives;
how he and ex-teammate <PERSON>Lance Rentzel</PERSON> pretended to be reporters and "crashed"
the press corps covering the <DATE>1975</DATE> Superbowl; how he criticized fellow players
and management.;    Dryer began to study acting in <DATE>1980</DATE>. After hanging up his
cleats in <DATE>1981</DATE>, he served briefly as a <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION> color commentator, then went
full-force into acting, chalking up credits in TV movies such as "Starmaker"
with <PERSON>Rock Hudson</PERSON>, and several TV pilots. He came close to landing the role of
<PERSON>Sam Malone</PERSON> in "Cheers" -- and wound up playing a friend of <PERSON>Sam</PERSON> (<PERSON>Ted Danson</PERSON>) in
several episodes -- before "Hunter.";    Q: Was <PERSON>Tom Selleck</PERSON> once a regular on
"The Young and the Restless"?;    A: <PERSON>Selleck</PERSON> did appear on the soap in <DATE>1975</DATE> --
as publisher <PERSON>Jed Andrews</PERSON> -- but his run lasted a mere nine shows. Asked to
sign a contract to continue with the show, he declined.;    Q: Whatever
happened to <PERSON>Joyce DeWitt</PERSON> of "Three's Company"?;    A: Since the series died in
<DATE>1984</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>DeWitt</ORGANIZATION> has done some plays and has traveled around the world twice.
She's reading screenplays.;     Q: On "The Virginian," did <PERSON>James Drury</PERSON> ever
have a name or was he always referred to as The Virginian?;    A: The
mysterious Virginian never revealed his name -- not in the TV series, not in
the "Virginian" movies that preceded it (including <DATE>1929</DATE>'s "The Virginian"
starring <PERSON>Gary Cooper</PERSON> and <PERSON>Walter Huston</PERSON>), and not in the <DATE>1902</DATE> <PERSON>Owen Wister</PERSON>

FT  15 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: More important than matters of life and death
 -Political unrest, civil war and economic hardship are simply minor
irritations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON KUPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The best way to get applauded on the streets of <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION> is to wear a Brazilian
football shirt. Haiti's team are so bad they were kept out of the World Cup
by <LOCATION>Bermuda</LOCATION>, so the whole country supports <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>.
'You are asking which is more important - <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> or a <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> invasion?' one fan
asked an American reporter. 'We are hungry every day. We have problems every
day. The Americans talk about invading every day. But we only have the World
Cup every four years.'
During the World Cup, economic sanctions against <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION> have failed to bite
and talks between government and opposition were out of the question. At
half-time during matches, <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>'s black-and white TV sets show bloody videos
of the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> invasion of <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>, with texts like No to Intervention
superimposed.
'This country is demobilised by the World Cup,' complains Haitian Prime
Minister <PERSON>Robert Malval</PERSON>. 'I think when we wake up on <DATE>July 18</DATE> - that's the end
of the World Cup party. And that will be the beginning of the end of the
party here.'
This World Cup is having a bigger effect on countries' politics than any
previous World Cup. True, the Argentine junta used the <DATE>1978</DATE> World Cup much
as the Haitian junta is using this one, and <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION>'s <DATE>1954</DATE> triumph did
more to restore German self-respect than <PERSON>Konrad Adenauer</PERSON> ever could.
Other examples abound. But this World Cup is more serious. For a start,
there are more TV sets in the world today than there were even four years
ago. The tournament is attracting vast audiences. The average human - a
Chinese peasant, <ORGANIZATION>Essex Man</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Alexandr Solzhenitsyn</PERSON> - will probably have
watched six World Cup games by the end of <DATE>Sunday</DATE>'s final.
Rwandans root for <LOCATION>Nigeria</LOCATION>, Bangladeshis for <PERSON>Maradona</PERSON> (they held protest
marches in <LOCATION>Dhaka</LOCATION> after he was banned for drug-taking), and no doubt the
Eskimos have their favourite team.
In <DATE>1950</DATE>, famously, <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> learned by telegram that the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> had beaten
<LOCATION>England</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>, and even later things were not much better in <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION>. But telegrams do not tend to demobilise nations.
Second, in this lone superpower world, the World Cup is the one key arena
which the Americans do not dominate. One Mexican soccer-lover living in
<LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> told me that he would prefer not to see football taking off in the
<LOCATION>US</LOCATION>.
The World Cup is the most direct way we have of ranking the nations of the
world - it is hard to compare GDPs in a way that is quite as visually
appealing - and the Americans' weakness at soccer leaves the field
relatively even.
Soccer can give a nation status. When we say '<LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> beat <ORGANIZATION>Holland</ORGANIZATION>' we feel
we are talking not just about their soccer teams but about the countries
themselves.
'In the World Cup, all we lost is two games. We didn't lose our national
honour,' a Colombian state governor tried to argue a few days ago. He was
standing beside the coffin of <PERSON>Andres Escobar</PERSON>, the Colombian player (and
own-goal scorer) slain on his return home.
Whereas in the past most countries were dictatorships propped up by the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>
or <ORGANIZATION>USSR</ORGANIZATION>, now dozens are (or are becoming) democracies. <PERSON>Nicolae Ceaucescu</PERSON> and
<PERSON>Todor Zhivkov</PERSON> did not worry about public opinion, and in the <DATE>1980s</DATE> nor did
African leaders.
Now the Cameroonian president, <PERSON>Paul Biya</PERSON>, is so worried that for two World
Cups in a row he has recalled the middle-aged <PERSON>Roger Milla</PERSON> to the team (what
will he do in <DATE>1998</DATE>, when <LOCATION>Milla</LOCATION> is 46?).
Ethnic tension rises, and rulers look to the World Cup to foster unity.
General <PERSON>Sani Abacha</PERSON> likes the Nigerian team to include players from each of
the country's three main tribes, and after <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION> beat <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>, President
<PERSON>Ion Iliescu</PERSON> said the ethnically diverse team had created a 'national
consensus.' (That was before the ethnic <PERSON>Serb Belodedici</PERSON> missed the decisive
penalty in the quarter-final).
The <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> squad, which contains Hispanics, blacks, Italian- and Greek-Americans
 -precious few Wasps - received a call from President <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> that was shown
on prime-time TV.
Democratic rulers everywhere are struggling, and they all turn to the World
Cup. In <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>, where soccer is perhaps the least tarnished national
institution of the moment, <PERSON>Silvio Berlusconi</PERSON> got himself elected prime
minister with a party named after a football chant.
In <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>, presidents have appeared on TV during the
World Cup to suggest changes to the national team's line-up. Even in <LOCATION>Norway</LOCATION>,
Prime Minister <PERSON>Gro Brundtland</PERSON> appeared on a TV panel commenting on the
country's opening game.
Countries that need the World Cup most were only admitted to it quite
recently. <ORGANIZATION>Fifa</ORGANIZATION>, soccer's governing body, first gave <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> a World Cup berth
in <DATE>1970</DATE>; only this year did the continent get three places. <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION>, with more
than half the world's population, for long had only one spot, and still has
only two.
And the poor are improving. African teams regularly reach the second round.
The Third World cares: when <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION> drew with <LOCATION>Holland</LOCATION> in <DATE>1990</DATE>, soldiers of all
factions in <LOCATION>Beirut</LOCATION> spent the night firing into the air. When <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> beat
<LOCATION>Cameroon</LOCATION> a couple of weeks later, a Bangladeshi man had a heart attack and a
Bangladeshi woman killed herself. 'The elimination of <LOCATION>Cameroon</LOCATION> also means
the end of my life,' read her suicide note.
Americans are trying hard to understand. 'When <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> lost in <DATE>1990</DATE> people
were jumping off buildings,' said <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> star striker <PERSON>Eric Wynalda</PERSON>. 'I don't
think anyone jumped off a building when <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> lost the Superbowl.'

FT  16 APR 92 / International Company News: CBS recovers with Dollars 19.5m
profit in first three months
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CBS, the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> media group, yesterday reported a <DATE>first-quarter</DATE> operating profit
of Dollars 19.5m, a substantial recovery from the Dollars 54.6m loss
incurred at the same stage of <DATE>1991</DATE> when the Gulf war, a slump in advertising
demand and restructuring charges sent the company deep into the red.
The earnings were greeted warmly on Wall Street, and <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION> shares rose Dollars
6 1/2 to Dollars 184 1/2 on the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> in early trading.
Improvements in operating results at the <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION>'s nationwide network and its
group of regional television stations, and savings from reductions in
underlying costs, were the main reason behind the turnround in earnings,
said the company.
<PERSON>Mr Laurence Tisch</PERSON>, chairman and chief executive of <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION>, said the company was
beginning to benefit from its new position as the top-ranked network in the
<LOCATION>US</LOCATION>, a position which he believed would soon feed through into advertising
revenues.
However, the domestic advertising climate remained difficult in the <DATE>first
quarter</DATE>.
CBS's coverage of American football's Superbowl and the <LOCATION>Albertville</LOCATION> winter
Olympics were a success, but excluding the revenue contribution from the two
special sporting events, the network's <DATE>first-quarter</DATE> sales were essentially
the same as a year ago. This was an indication that the weak economy
continued to restrain demand for television advertising.
A cyclical recovery in advertising demand is anticipated. <PERSON>Mr Tisch</PERSON> said
there was evidence in the opening weeks of <DATE>this year's second quarter</DATE> of a
'steadying of demand for network time'.
The company suffered from a big decline in interest income on investments
during the quarter, which fell to Dollars 7.5m from Dollars 65.8m in the
<DATE>first three months of 1991</DATE>, when sales of securities to fund a share
buy-back operation and the final settlement of the sale of <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION>'s recorded
music business brought windfall gains.
<ORGANIZATION>Gannett</ORGANIZATION>, the newspaper publisher that owns USA Today, lifted net income for
the <DATE>first quarter</DATE> to Dollars 55.5m or <MONEY>39 cents</MONEY> a share from Dollars 50.1m,
or <MONEY>32 cents</MONEY>, for the same period last year.
The increase came on revenue of Dollars 793.1m compared to Dollars 786.5m
for the same period last year.

   Safety, insurance, medical and police experts
<DATE>Monday</DATE> asked <ORGANIZATION>Nissan</ORGANIZATION> not to show a television fantasy commercial for
its 300ZX Turbo sports car on grounds it promotes ``excessive and
unsafe speed.''
   ``This is hitting a new low in automobile advertising,'' said
<PERSON>Brian O'Neill</PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION>Insurance Institute for Highway
Safety</ORGANIZATION>. ``This is the worst example of an out-and-out speed ad
we've ever seen.''
   The company declined, saying it believed the ad would never be
taken for real.
   In the dream-like commercial, set on an automotive speedway, the
300ZX Turbo outpaces a motorcycle, race car and jet plane as its
driver murmurs: ``Some have to dream. I'm in a Turbo 300 and these
guys are after me _ and they can't catch me.''
   In the final shot of the commercial, scheduled to be shown
during next <DATE>Sunday</DATE>'s Superbowl football championship, the car leaps
from the ground, all four wheels in the air.
   ``The message in the ad is simple and straight forward: Look at
how fast this car can go,'' O'Meill told a news conference.
   <PERSON>O'Neill</PERSON> said the commercial ``irresponsibly promotes excessive
speed and exhibits a blatant disregard for public safety.''
   He was joined in denouncing the ad by <PERSON>Dr. Howard Champion</PERSON>,
director of the <ORGANIZATION>Medstar</ORGANIZATION> shock-trauma unit at the <ORGANIZATION>Washington
Hospital Center</ORGANIZATION>, Lt. Col. <PERSON>C.M. Robinson</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Virginia State
Police</ORGANIZATION> and retired <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> Brig. Gen. <PERSON>Robert McDermott</PERSON>, chairman
of <ORGANIZATION>USAA Insurance Group of San Antonio</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``When you're promoting speed and killing young people, you're
going too far,'' <PERSON>McDermott</PERSON> said, who pronounced himself
``surprised, outraged and disgusted'' with the commercial.
   Asked if his company would continue to insure the 300ZX,
<PERSON>McDermott</PERSON> replied: ``We may not.'' But later he told a reporter:
``I don't want to threaten them. I want to wait and see if they
pull the ad.''
   <PERSON>Dan Spetner</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Nissan</ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, dismissed the
criticism.
   ``We believe that the Turbo 300 ad is so futuristic and
far-fetched that it would never be interpreted as representing a
real-life driving situation,'' <PERSON>Spetner</PERSON> said.
   ``It should be up to the American public to decide what can or
cannot be shown on our airwaves,'' he said.
   ``<ORGANIZATION>Nissan</ORGANIZATION> claims this ad is a fantasy,'' <PERSON>O'Neill</PERSON> said. ``But what
isn't a fantasy at ll ... is that people are dying in high-speed
crashes involving this car.''
   He displayed photographs of two demolished 300ZX models taken
after recent crashes in which three people were killed.
   O'Neill also complained that <ORGANIZATION>Nissan</ORGANIZATION>'s <DATE>1990</DATE> 300ZX is not equipped
with safety airbags but instead features what he said are ``vastly
inferior detachable automatic belt systems.''
   ``<ORGANIZATION>Nissan</ORGANIZATION>'s contention that the ad is a fantasy is a transparent
farce,'' <PERSON>McDermott</PERSON> said. ``It has only one, unmistakable,
overpowering message _ speed, period.''
   <PERSON>O'Neill</PERSON> said his institute estimates that the 300ZX in the
commercial was exceeding 150 mph.
   ``If there was a crash at that speed there would be nothing left
of that car _ little pieces,'' he said.

   PORTLAND, Ore. -- The battle between the two giant
athletic shoe companies escalated, as a unit of Reebok
International Ltd. sued Nike Inc. alleging
patent-infringement violations.
   In U.S. District Court yesterday, the Reebok subsidiary,
Avia Group International Inc., filed a suit against Nike,
contending that the Beaverton, Ore., company infringed on
three patents relating to the construction of the sole of its
shoes.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   <ORGANIZATION>Avia</ORGANIZATION> claims the technology used in <ORGANIZATION>Nike</ORGANIZATION>'s new "Air 180"
running shoe is an infringement of its Canteliver technology,
a system that, it says, gives the shoes "a trampoline
effect."
   In addition to unspecified damages, <ORGANIZATION>Avia</ORGANIZATION> is seeking a
preliminary and permanent injunction against <ORGANIZATION>Nike</ORGANIZATION>.
   A <ORGANIZATION>Nike</ORGANIZATION> spokesman denied any wrongdoing, saying that the
company intends "to vigorously defend its right to continue
this technology."
   "We developed the technology, incorporated in the 180 Air
shoe, independently as part of a natural evolution of our
<ORGANIZATION>Nike Air</ORGANIZATION> technology," said <PERSON>Lindsay Stewart</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Nike</ORGANIZATION> attorney.
   The company plans to incorporate the technology into its
basketball, tennis and other shoes as well, he said. "It's a
very important part of our new product."
   The "Air 180," which is selling well both in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and
abroad, retails for about <MONEY>$125</MONEY>, a company spokesman said.
<ORGANIZATION>Nike</ORGANIZATION> has spent about <MONEY>$20 million</MONEY> launching the product,
featuring it in a commercial that aired on television during
the Superbowl last <DATE>January</DATE>. The shoe is also the centerpiece
of another <ORGANIZATION>Nike</ORGANIZATION> ad currently running on TV.

FT  24 NOV 94 / Metropolitan Phoenix rises as construction industry hots up:
Building employment is booming, but competitive market is helping restrain
pay inflation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ARIZONA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
In a construction-driven economy like the <LOCATION>Phoenix</LOCATION> metropolitan area, where
building accounts for 30 per cent of all new job creation, you can see the
signs of expansion all around you: in the red-tiled homes sprouting among
newly-planted palm trees and saguaro cacti in the north valley and the shiny
office buildings and shopping centres downtown.
Other sectors are prospering, too. <ORGANIZATION>Intel</ORGANIZATION> is putting up a Dollars 1.3bn
microchip plant in the southern suburb of <LOCATION>Chandler</LOCATION>, and surging copper
prices have brought good times again to <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>'s old-established mining
industry.
Employment in the state is projected to climb by 5 per cent this year, with
much of the growth in the <LOCATION>Phoenix</LOCATION> metropolitan area, and construction
employment has been expanding at an annual pace above 15 per cent.
'The <LOCATION>Greater Phoenix</LOCATION> economy is booming, and signs point to continued
prosperity over the next several years,' proclaims the <ORGANIZATION>Greater Phoenix
Economic Council</ORGANIZATION>, a public and private sector partnership which boosts
development in the metropolitan area.
As the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Reserve</ORGANIZATION> seeks to cool down a national economy where
employment is growing only half as quickly, hot spots like <LOCATION>Phoenix</LOCATION> are the
sort of area where the inflationary pressures the <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION> fears might be
expected to be showing up already.
But local economists say that even the most rapidly growing sector of the
local economy - construction - is not showing the kind of wage inflation
that might be expected.
'There is definitely a lot of pressure on wages but I don't believe that it
is being translated into higher wage levels. It's a sufficiently competitive
housing market that you couldn't simply raise wages, or you'd be priced out
of it,' says <PERSON>Mr Dan Anderson</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Department of Economic Security</ORGANIZATION>.
Home prices in <LOCATION>Phoenix</LOCATION> have risen by 3.3 per cent over the past year to an
average of Dollars 91,100, but remain well below those in nearby cities such
as <LOCATION>Albuquerque</LOCATION> or <LOCATION>Las Vegas</LOCATION>, and less than half the average of <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>
or <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>.
Bottlenecks are emerging, however, particularly for construction skills such
as framing carpenters. 'When you see hand-painted signs on building lots
saying 'Framers wanted - apply on site' you know there are skill shortages,'
says <PERSON>Mr Bill Stephenson</PERSON>, director of economic development with <ORGANIZATION>Arizona
Public Service</ORGANIZATION>, the largest local utility.
Skilled framers are more likely to look for work in neighbouring <LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION>  -
also experiencing strong construction activity - or in southern <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>,
where demand for construction labour has been heavy this year as the <LOCATION>Los
Angeles</LOCATION> area seeks to rebuild after <DATE>January</DATE>'s earthquake.
'The wages <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> pays are clearly higher than wages offered here. We
simply could not compete with them,' says <PERSON>Mr Anderson</PERSON>.
'Basically, the building companies have hired all the really skilled people
they can and they are now down to hiring people who are really learning on
the job, and those people are not paid that much,' says <PERSON>Mr Tracy Clark</PERSON> of
the <ORGANIZATION>Economic Outlook Centre</ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION>Arizona State University</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Tempe</LOCATION>, a
southeastern suburb of <LOCATION>Phoenix</LOCATION>.
Instead of raising wages or prices, builders are simply stretching out their
construction times.
'Where they might have been able to complete a house in 90 days we are now
seeing 120 or 150 days,' says <PERSON>Mr Anderson</PERSON>.
In other segments of the labour market, however, <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION> still has a degree
of slack.
'We've got tool and die makers selling hardware at the department store,
waiting for the right job to come along,' says <PERSON>Mr Stephenson</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Arizona
Public Service</ORGANIZATION>.
Local economists say growth this time around is built on much more solid
foundations than the construction boom of the mid-1980s, which burst
spectacularly when the tax breaks which had prompted it were repealed.
This year, construction activity has been centred on single family homes,
with building closely tied to real demand. The boom in this sector is now
slowing down, as pent-up demand from the recession has now largely been
satisfied, and is expected to glide down to a pace tied to the state's
population growth, forecast at around <MONEY>2.6 per cent</MONEY> a year. Apartment
construction may now start to pick up the slack, but the building industry
is not expected to have all cylinders firing at once.
Still, there is one sign of speculative overheating that the <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION> might want
to keep an eye on. The <ORGANIZATION>Arizona Cardinals American</ORGANIZATION> football team plays in a
first rate stadium deemed good enough to host the Superbowl national
football championship game in <DATE>1996</DATE>, but <PERSON>Mr Bill Bidwill</PERSON>, the team owner, is
already talking about building a new stadium.
Cynical Phoenix sports fans suggest that <PERSON>Mr Bidwill</PERSON> might want to build a
winning team before he starts thinking about a new stadium.

   Regarding <PERSON>Martin Morse Wooster</PERSON>'s <DATE>Aug. 16</DATE> editorial-page article "The Economist Missurveys America": I was born, bred, raised and educated in the <LOCATION>Midwest</LOCATION>, and proud of it. 
Never once has The Economist denigrated <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> or this region. 
It has given this country fair coverage as events have dictated. 
I plead guilty to one charge raised by <PERSON>Mr. Wooster</PERSON>: I am something of an Anglophile. 
But I am also an Americanophile and so, I have discovered during the past eight years, are most of the British staff members. 
They genuinely like it here and revel in experiencing new customs such as the Superbowl and the World Series. 
However, this country, like any other, is not perfect, and when The Economist rightly points it out it is not done out of bias or condescension but in a spirit of fair criticism among friends. 

   The charge that The Economist is biased against Republicans or conservatives is absurd on its face. 
Like all on the fringes of the political spectrum, right or left, <PERSON>Mr. Wooster</PERSON>'s definition of news is that which conforms to his opinions. 
It is not The Economist's job to confer respectability to viewpoints that cannot gain acceptance on their own merits. 
If <PERSON>Mr. Wooster</PERSON> wants more coverage of his party line, he can go out and earn it. 

   R. <PERSON>Greg Bailey 

   Louis</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Mo</LOCATION>. 

   ---

   As a longtime subscriber to The Economist, I can heartily ratify <PERSON>Mr. Wooster</PERSON>'s sentiments. 
If anything, he understates the varying shades of condescension, spite and venom displayed toward our country (and especially toward the conservatives therein) in "The American Survey" published regularly in The Economist. 
It leads one to wonder if reporting of events in other countries is similarly biased and distorted. 
But whereas <PERSON>Mr. Wooster</PERSON> seems to note principally errors of omission, there are also other kinds of errors. 

   For example, the following statement was made on page 23 of the <DATE>April 29, 1989</DATE>: issue ". . . by creating a huge budget deficit and a soaring dollar he (President <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>) helped to engineer the trade deficits that remain the motive force of American protectionism." 

   The author of that quotation evidently does not understand the American system of government (only <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>, by failing to raise funds for expenditures only it can authorize, can create budget deficits) or else he intentionally falsifies the record. 
In either case, in making such a false statement regarding one of the most important matters concerning our country, The Economist certainly does not live up to the reputation <PERSON>Mr. Wooster</PERSON> gives it of being "the best newsmagazine in the world." 

   <PERSON>William T. St.Clair</PERSON> 

   <LOCATION>Irvington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Va</LOCATION>. 

   ---

   I have been a reader of The Economist since the time it was airmailed from <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> many years ago. 
<PERSON>Mr. Wooster</PERSON>'s article is mainly misleading but does contain two truths: 1. 
He begins the article by saying "The Economist is the best newsmagazine in the world." 
It is. 
And, 2. 
He ends by pleading that The Economist quote <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s conservatives when they are intelligent and ignore them when they are dull. 
It does.

<P>
The weapons were high-speed mixers, Cuisinarts and spatulas. The mission was to 
whip up the most exotic haute cuisine this side of <PERSON>Wolfgang Puck</PERSON>. The 
location:<ORGANIZATION>Tustin Marine Corps Air Station</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
A Marine mess hall?The address on the press release wasn't a mistake. On 
<DATE>Thursday</DATE>, 42 cooks from <ORGANIZATION>Marine</ORGANIZATION> bases at <LOCATION>Tustin</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>El Toro</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Camp Pendleton</LOCATION> were 
applying the crowning touches to culinary creations that would tickle the 
palate of any five-star restaurant regular. 
</P>
<P>
It was the eighth annual Culinary Arts Exhibition, a competition among Marine 
cooks to prove to themselves and anyone willing to take a bite that the corps 
has enlisted more than a few good cooks. 
</P>
<P>
It's no secret that military cooking has taken more than its share of criticism 
over the years. And those in the mess hall who plan, prepare and plop those 
hearty -- some say mysterious -- entrees onto hundreds of trays each day are 
more than a little miffed by the lack of respect. 
</P>
<P>
"Day in and day out, mess cooks don't get the respect they should," complained 
Sgt. <PERSON>Paul Washington</PERSON>, the head baker at <ORGANIZATION>El Toro Marine Corps Air Station</ORGANIZATION>. "Most 
of the guys who eat in the mess think the only thing we can do is cook chicken 
three different ways or fry a jelly doughnut. C'mon, we're artists. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
To prove it, <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> was ankle deep in spent tubes of decorative icing which 
he had used on his creation, a "Day in the Park" -- a lavish, white pound cake 
more 3 feet long and 2 feet wide covered with shaved coconut dyed green to look 
like grass. He built a teeter-totter, park bench and drinking fountain using 
edible gum paste. 
</P>
<P>
The master touch was the pond in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>'s park:a clear Pyrex bowl sunk in 
the cake and filled with water and two goldfish. Even the cake below the bowl 
was dyed blue. 
</P>
<P>
"Tell me we can't cook," <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> remarked, smiling at the cake, which was 
large enough to serve about 300. 
</P>
<P>
At the cavernous kitchen at the <LOCATION>Tustin</LOCATION> base, competing cooks -- some huddled in 
teams and others working alone -- looked as serious as Superbowl combatants. 
Some formed elaborate ice sculptures, including the Statue of Liberty and 
Batman, while others fashioned whales out of watermelons. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibition was started eight years ago by the <ORGANIZATION>Tustin Chamber of Commerce</ORGANIZATION>, 
anxious to show its appreciation to the Marines for helping cook pancakes 
during the city's annual Tiller Days celebration. The chamber still pays for 
the trophies, as well as most of the food used in the contest. 
</P>
<P>
Winning isn't everything, the cooks say. But it has to be mighty important, 
judging by Staff Sgt. <PERSON>Phillip Johnson</PERSON>'s entree in the seafood category. <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> 
and his partner, Cpl. <PERSON>Clarence Green</PERSON>, created an entire tropical island scene. 
The ocean was various shades of blue gelatin dotted with snails, oysters and 
smelt. Cucumbers garnished with green peppers served as palm trees and coconuts 
cut in two were beach huts. Mounds of mashed potatoes formed the mountainous 
backdrop, and <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> even fashioned cooking pots out of radishes filled with 
dry ice that appeared to be smoking. 
</P>
<P>
Top-flight food, as military fare goes, is nothing new to the <LOCATION>Tustin</LOCATION> air 
station. In <DATE>May</DATE>, the 42-member mess hall staff was honored as the best in the 
<ORGANIZATION>Marine Corps</ORGANIZATION> nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
But as any restaurateur will attest, for every satisfied customer, there's one 
who walks out grumbling. 
</P>
<P>
"Those cooks can win all kinds of awards, but unless they find a way to keep 
those French fries warm, they won't win many fans on base," one <ORGANIZATION>Marine</ORGANIZATION> said 
<DATE>Thursday</DATE> as he left the mess hall. STEVEN R. CHURMMARINE CUISINEGROCERY LIST

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most reporters dread the end of a year. This is
because they are told to write a long story about the year's major
stories and what it all means. But there are those who enjoy such
work.
   His name is <PERSON>Andy Rooney</PERSON>. He is at <ORGANIZATION>CBS News</ORGANIZATION> and he gets to grouse
on ``60 Minutes'' each week. This <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, he has 60 minutes of
his own _ a little less, technically speaking _ to grouse or be
amused about this year.
   His show, ``A Year With <PERSON>Andy Rooney</PERSON>: <DATE>1989</DATE>,'' will arrive two
nights after <ORGANIZATION>ABC News</ORGANIZATION>' ``Images of the Eighties'' and one after <ORGANIZATION>NBC
News</ORGANIZATION>' ``The Eighties.'' Those are specials about the decade, not
just one little year.
   <PERSON>Rooney</PERSON>, who is more comfortable with a year, doesn't mind doing
``year-enders,'' as they're called by journalists.
   ``As a writer, it's a lot of fun. All you need is something to
write about. And here it is, all sitting there for you. And every
event spurs an idea or observation. It's a great thing for an
essayist.''
   He is asked if this week's print and broadcast flood of
year-enders and decade-enders has any real virtue.
   ``Well,'' he muses, ``does virtue have any real virtue? But I
think if looking at where we've been helps us where we're going,
yes, to that extent they have some virtue.''
   Rooney, 68, has done five other one-hour essays of the kind
airing <DATE>Thursday</DATE>. The last was in <DATE>1985</DATE>, when he took a helicopter
across the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> for a bird's-eye perspective of the nation.
   In preparing a gimlet-eye perspective of <DATE>1989</DATE>, he went by
subject, rather than proceeding chronologically. Business,
education, guns, communism's decline, and even certain TV people
were among the subjects inspected.
   For example, he notes that <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Diane Sawyer</PERSON> was induced to
leave <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION> for <MONEY>$2 million</MONEY> a year ``and the chance to work with <PERSON>Sam
Donaldson</PERSON>.''
   In contrast, <ORGANIZATION>Connie Chung</ORGANIZATION>, in leaving <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION> for <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION>, ``only got
<MONEY>$1.5 million</MONEY>. But she got to work alone.''
   Rooney began work on ``<DATE>1989</DATE>'' last <DATE>summer</DATE>. When interviewed last
week, he had just heard bad news from <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION> officialdom. They said
that what he turned in exceeded an hour by one minute.
   This is not good, as he only really has 47 minutes he can call
his own. Commercials and promotions for other shows get the rest of
the hour. He returns with heavy heart and producer <PERSON>Robert Forte</PERSON> to
the editing room and starts throwing things out.
   A reflection on the death of the famous race horse Secretariat
runs 24 seconds. Out. Who won the <LOCATION>Superbowl</LOCATION>, the World Series, and
lesser championships run 40 seconds. Adios.
   The obituary of the anguished announcer who reported the flaming
crash of the dirigible Hindenberg in <DATE>1937</DATE> took 40 seconds. Farewell
to that, likewise a slightly shorter thought on former Secretary of
<ORGANIZATION>Defense</ORGANIZATION> nominee <ORGANIZATION>John Tower</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``A lot of good weather'' got the boot, too, <PERSON>Rooney</PERSON> says,
``although we kept Hurricane Hugo.''
   Thirty seconds here, 40 there, 16 here, it adds up. But it is a
heartbreaking task taking it all out after all that work to put it
all in. On the bright side, <PERSON>Rooney</PERSON> does have 47 minutes.
   ``They're doing the decade on the (CBS) `<ORGANIZATION>Evening News</ORGANIZATION>' in two
seven-minute sections,'' he marvels. ``How the hell do they do
that?''

   A strong earthquake rattled across
central and northern <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> early today, causing minor damage
in this agricultural town and shaking people awake over a wide
area, officials said. No injuries were reported.
   The quake measured 5.1 on the Richter scale, said <PERSON>Anthony Lomax</PERSON>,
spokesman for the seismology laboratory at the <ORGANIZATION>University of
California</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Berkeley</LOCATION>.
   He said the strong quake struck at <TIME>12:40 a.m.</TIME> about seven miles
southeast of <LOCATION>Hollister</LOCATION>, a quake-prone city some 75 miles southeast
of <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>.
   In <PERSON>Hollister</PERSON>, the tremor knocked products off store shelves,
broke a glass door and set off burglar alarms across the city, said
<PERSON>Paul Penn</PERSON>, emergency services coordinator for <LOCATION>San Benito County</LOCATION>.
   But no injuries were reported, and power was not interrupted, he
said.
   ``<LOCATION>San Benito County</LOCATION> is known as one of the more seismically
active counties in the country, so you get used to it,'' <LOCATION>Penn</LOCATION>
added. ``The last major one was Superbowl <DATE>Sunday 1986</DATE>.''
   People living over a broad area reported feeling strong earth
movement, with jittery residents in <LOCATION>Modesto</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, and
<LOCATION>Monterey</LOCATION> calling authorities for reassurance.
   ``I was standing in a sturdy old building when I felt the ground
begin to rumble, and lights began shaking,'' said <PERSON>Gordon Bock</PERSON>, a
Time magazine staff writer experiencing his first earthquake.
   ``I'm from <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. I've only read about these things,'' said
<PERSON>Bock</PERSON>, who was in <LOCATION>Asilomar</LOCATION>, near <LOCATION>Monterey</LOCATION>, when the temblor hit.
``My stomach is churning and my hands are still shaking.''

   Petting animals, singing for peace and a massive steak fry and
rodeo have been added this year to the more traditional champagne
toasts and party-horn tooting as ways of greeting the New Year.
   There also will be fake snow for the unusually unwintry <LOCATION>New
Hampshire</LOCATION> and blankets for the homeless in usually warm <LOCATION>Phoenix</LOCATION>.
   In the <ORGANIZATION>Smoky Mountains of Tennessee</ORGANIZATION>, at least 100 couples are
planning to start off the New Year by hitching up with a new spouse,
according to the Rev. <PERSON>Ed Taylor</PERSON>, dubbed the ``marry-thon'' minister
of the Smokies.
   ``This takes the cake. This <DATE>weekend</DATE> has turned into the second
busiest time of the year,'' <PERSON>Taylor</PERSON> said <DATE>Friday</DATE>. He performed 113
marriages <DATE>last Valentine's Day</DATE>.
   ``We've got four ministers and three chapels going,'' <PERSON>Taylor</PERSON> said
of his interdenominational <ORGANIZATION>Gatlinburg Ministries Inc</ORGANIZATION>.
   <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION> football fans in <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION> for the <LOCATION>Fiesta Bowl</LOCATION> game
<DATE>Jan. 2</DATE> between the No. 3 ranked <ORGANIZATION>Mountaineers</ORGANIZATION> and No. 1 ranked <LOCATION>Notre
Dame</LOCATION> are planning the ``Superbowl of alumni parties,'' said <PERSON>Steve
Douglas</PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION>West Virginia Alumni Association</ORGANIZATION>.
   A steak fry and private rodeo are planned <DATE>Sunday</DATE> for about 7,500
people, complete with fireworks, dancing and the Mountaineer mascot
parading on the back of a bull.
   The event, at <ORGANIZATION>Rawhide</ORGANIZATION>, a Western theme park in <LOCATION>Scottsdale</LOCATION>, is so
massive it is being staged in shifts. About half the crowd will have
dinner, while the other half is at the rodeo, and then they'll
switch, <PERSON>Douglas</PERSON> said.
   In the home of the New Year's tradition synonymous with the chaos
of the <TIME>night</TIME>'s revelry, the ball to be dropped at the stroke of
<TIME>midnight</TIME> in <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION>'s Times Square will be different. The
wrought-iron ball replaces the red apple used in recent years
``because it's a more universal symbol,'' said <PERSON>Tama Starr</PERSON>, president
of <ORGANIZATION>Artkraft Strauss Sign Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, which created the new ball.
   The dropping of the ball began in <DATE>1908</DATE>.
   New Yorkers who party at a downtown nightclub called B2 will be
treated to a shower of dollar bills _ <MONEY>$5,000</MONEY> worth _ that will rain
onto the dance floor at <TIME>midnight</TIME>. A quick-handed partygoer might be
able to recoup the <MONEY>$65</MONEY> price of admission.
   At <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Cathedral of St. John</ORGANIZATION> the Divine, a free ``Concert
For Peace'' includes a prayer for peace being read by actor <PERSON>Jason
Robards</PERSON> and songs by folk singer <ORGANIZATION>Odetta</ORGANIZATION>.
   About 1,000 artists will exhibit and perform on <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>'s public
plazas and storefront stages for the city's 13th annual <ORGANIZATION>First Night</ORGANIZATION>
celebration.
   ``It's an opportunity for everyone to come together to celebrate
the city's cultural life and feel a part of it,'' said <PERSON>Bruce
Rossley</PERSON>, the city's commissioner for arts and humanities.
   Rhode Islanders will have a choice of <ORGANIZATION>First Night</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Last Night</ORGANIZATION>
celebrations. The fourth annual <ORGANIZATION>First Night</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Providence</LOCATION> is
expected to draw about 40,000 people for a variety of alcohol-free
festivities. The <ORGANIZATION>Last Night</ORGANIZATION> is a farewell party at the 100-year-old
Rhodes-on-the-Pawtuxet ballroom, which is closing for at least two
years.
   At <ORGANIZATION>Patriots Square</ORGANIZATION>, a new downtown park in <LOCATION>Phoenix</LOCATION>, there will be
space heaters and tents to keep some 1,000 partygoers warm as they
watch fireworks and bands New Year's Eve. Low temperatures in recent
days have been running in the 20s and 30s, unusually cold for this
time of year. Those who attend are being asked to bring blankets for
seating during the event, to then be distributed to the homeless.
   In <LOCATION>New Hampshire</LOCATION>, where snow is routine for New Year's, the city
of <LOCATION>Concord</LOCATION> is manufacturing the powdery stuff on the <LOCATION>Statehouse</LOCATION> lawn
for the ice sculptures to be featured in its <ORGANIZATION>First Night</ORGANIZATION> celebration
New Year's Eve. The downtown area will be roped off to traffic so
the thousands of celebrants can take in such events as band
concerts, dances, puppet shows, chorales, storytelling and trick
bike acts, climaxed by fireworks at <TIME>midnight</TIME>.
   Included in the <ORGANIZATION>First Night</ORGANIZATION> celebration in <LOCATION>Portsmouth</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.H.</LOCATION>, will
be a petting farm featuring farm animals. The idea is to increase
the understanding of agriculture among schoolchildren.
   And to remind partygoers to keep it a happy new year, <ORGANIZATION>Mothers
Against Drunk Driving</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> is sponsoring a statewide ``Tie One
On'' program to tie red ribbons on antennas and rearview mirrors as
a reminder to motorists not to drink and drive.
   The program began Thanksgiving weekend and runs until the new
year.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Ohio State Highway Patrol</ORGANIZATION> plans to have 200 to 300 of it's
1,200 troopers on duty at any given time over this <DATE>weekend</DATE>.
   ``Our policy is visibility,'' said Lt. <PERSON>Dave Peters</PERSON>. ``The more
people we have out, the better it is,'' he said.
   In <LOCATION>Albany</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>, area hotels are offering weekend party packages
that include dinner, entertainment, champagne, overnight
accommodations and a New Year's Day brunch.
   ``People are very verbal about not drinking and driving,'' said
<PERSON>Shelley Gould</PERSON>, director of catering for the <ORGANIZATION>Hilton Hotel</ORGANIZATION> in downtown
<LOCATION>Albany</LOCATION>. ``They don't want to worry about it. ... That's why they
take the whole weekend.''

Down the street from LAX, overlooking the 405 Freeway, stands a billboard 
hawking a new <ORGANIZATION>BMW</ORGANIZATION> automobile. The ad reads: "Own the <LOCATION>San Diego Frwy</LOCATION>. For Just

Over the decades, moviegoers have been lured to theaters by all sorts of 
gimmicks and free gifts, including dishes, 3-D glasses, vomit bags and

Comes now "Phantom of the <ORGANIZATION>Mall</ORGANIZATION>," a shocker film at which spectators are being

</P>
<P>
According to a hypertension expert contacted by <ORGANIZATION>The Times</ORGANIZATION>, anyone with a blood

Normal blood pressure for a 40-year-old adult is 140/90, said <PERSON>Dr. Ka Kit Hui</PERSON>,

<HEAD>&amp; All That It Stands For</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Say what you will it about the savings and loan
crisis, it has done wonders for the ampersand.
   Vaguely old fashioned, the ampersand _ that curly little symbol
that stands for ``and'' _ seemed to be in a decline until the
financial difficulties of the S&amp;L industry put it on every front
page. For some reason, S&amp;Ls are always abbreviated with an
ampersand, just as superbowls are numbered with Roman numerals.
   Like everything else, the ampersand has a history. According to
<PERSON>Robert Hendrickson</PERSON>, who wrote the Encyclopedia of Word and Phrase
Origins, it was invented by <PERSON>Marcus Tiro</PERSON>, a freed slave and secretary
to <LOCATION>Cicero</LOCATION>, a Roman statesman, orator and author.
   Tiro's job was taking down <LOCATION>Cicero</LOCATION>'s dictation. Cicero talked
fast, so Tiro created the first known system of shorthand, including
the ampersand. Tiro's ``Tironian Notes'' saw wide use in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> for
nearly a thousand years.
   The &amp; itself was just a quick way of writing ``et,'' which means
``and'' in <LOCATION>Latin</LOCATION>. The name ``ampersand'' is a corruption of the term
``and per se and,'' which means ``as follows.''
   The <ORGANIZATION>Harper Dictionary of Contemporary Usage</ORGANIZATION> by <PERSON>William Morris</PERSON> and
<PERSON>Mary Morris</PERSON> laments the tendency of corporations to go modern and
abandon their ampersands.
   The Morrises note that the ad firm of <ORGANIZATION>Batten, Barton, Durstin &amp;
Osborne</ORGANIZATION> switched to simply <PERSON>Batten</PERSON>, <PERSON>Barton</PERSON>, <PERSON>Durstin</PERSON>, <PERSON>Osborne</PERSON>,
dropping the ampersand and losing ``part of the charm which led
<PERSON>Heywood Broun</PERSON> to say that the corporate name sounded to him like `a
beer barrel rolling down a flight of steps.'''
   In any event, the <LOCATION>Morrises</LOCATION>, getting down to business, decree that
the ampersand is to be avoided ``in writing of formal or semiformal
nature, save for the most impromptu personal notes.''
   However, the ampersand may be staging a corporate comeback, even
without the S&amp;L crisis' spur of conspicuousness, says <PERSON>Rick Bragdon</PERSON>,
senior vice president in the <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> firm which does ``name
development'' for companies changing their images.
   He said after stiff debate during a yearlong ``identity program''
for <ORGANIZATION>Pacific Gas and Electric</ORGANIZATION>, it was decided to abandon the ``and''
in ``PG and E,'' its old symbol, in favor of ``PG&amp;E.''
   ``We had to resolve once and for all how to represent `and,'''
<PERSON>Bragdon</PERSON> said.
   ``There were a whole variety of constituencies. Lots of people
wanted `and' and others wanted the ampersand and some thought a very
discrete plus sign would be modern and hip. We advocated the
ampersand as an inalienable part of the name _ a beautiful, stylized
ampersand.''
   However, to show how short-lived these victories are, <PERSON>Bragdon</PERSON>
said his own firm has changed its name, abandoning an ampersand in
the process. It used to be S&amp;O Consultants.
   The final decision was to go with <ORGANIZATION>Addison Design Consultants</ORGANIZATION>,
over the objections of founder and chairman <PERSON>Bob Ohrenschalls</PERSON>. In the
old days, he was the fellow behind the &amp;.

FT  30 JAN 93 / Sport: Lone Star state of mind - Dallas fans won't hear of
Super Bowl defeat / American Football
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF ANYWHERE in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> can lay claim to being the heart of American football
country, it is <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>. Many states provide more players to the professional
game. Some have more <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> teams and blue-chip, football-playing universities
 -but there is nowhere quite like <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> when it comes to passion for the
sport.
It is no surprise, then, that Texans are going wild over tomorrow's Super
Bowl at <LOCATION>Pasadena</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, which pits their beloved Dallas Cowboys
against the <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> Bills from <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> state.
Their enthusiasm for the game starts at the lowest level. Texas is mad about
high school football. 'A typical game in the city will draw between 5,000
and 10,000 people,' says <PERSON>Steve Davies</PERSON>, a sports reporter at the <ORGANIZATION>Dallas
Morning Herald</ORGANIZATION>.
'In the smaller towns, the crowds are the same which means that, in some
places, about 20 per cent of the local population is often at the game.'
Indeed, high school football is most popular in country areas - and not just
because it is often the only action in town other than the rodeo. For as
long as anyone can remember, rural <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> has been producing big, brave farm
boys suited ideally, in physique and temperament, to the bone-crunching
rigours of the gridiron.
The link between farming and football reaches its apotheosis at <ORGANIZATION>Texas
Agricultural and Mechanical</ORGANIZATION>, the finest footballing university in the state.
This year, A &amp; M attracted crowds of up to 80,000 as they won all their
games in the regular season and challenged for the title of national college
champions.
At professional level, football mania reaches even greater heights. Two
weeks ago, the <ORGANIZATION>Cowboys</ORGANIZATION> held a rally at their stadium in the city's outskirts
for fans wanting to boost the players in their bid to win the club's first
Super Bowl since <DATE>1978</DATE>. On a dull, rainy mid-week day, 70,000 people turned
up.
The rally was shown live on local television and repeated on the same
channel two nights later, attracting big ratings both times.
Even the Lone Star state's most famous entertainment export cannot compete.
The <ORGANIZATION>Cowboys' National Football League</ORGANIZATION> championship game against <LOCATION>San
Francisco</LOCATION> two <DATE>Sundays</DATE> ago attracted the biggest local television audience
ever in their home town, far outstripping the record held by the 'Who Shot
JR?' episode of the soap opera <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION>.
Although Texans are an hospitable bunch, the football fans sometimes take
their fanaticism to absurd limits. When the <LOCATION>Philadelphia Eagles</LOCATION> arrived
earlier this month to contest the <ORGANIZATION>Eastern Division</ORGANIZATION> title, shopkeepers in the
<LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> area removed cartons of <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> soft cheese from their shelves.
And <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, (population 1,900), has changed its name - to Blue Star
 -for this weekend.
The irony of the <ORGANIZATION>Cowboys</ORGANIZATION>' wonderful run this year is that the chief
architects - <PERSON>Jerry Jones</PERSON>, the owner, and <PERSON>Jimmy Johnson</PERSON>, the coach - both are
former star footballers at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Arkansas</ORGANIZATION>, a great college rival
of <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> A &amp; M and the <ORGANIZATION>University of Texas</ORGANIZATION>, and just a few miles across the
<LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> state line.
The two <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION> alumni took charge of the Cowboys 3 1/2 years ago. After a
couple of disastrous seasons, their drive to turn round a dispirited club
and a struggling team began to pay off.
After winning only one game in the <DATE>1989</DATE> season, <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> improved so rapidly
that this year they won 13 of the 16 regular season matches.
Jones and <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> have been ruthless in re-shaping the club - the old
management was purged and unwanted players traded away to make room for
fresh faces. They have shown a willingness to gamble, too, both with the
selection of their teams and with the plays that have been called during
games.
Like the <ORGANIZATION>Miami University</ORGANIZATION> team that <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> coached to a national college
championship late in the <DATE>1980s</DATE>, the Cowboys are built on speed, or what
American footballers call 'quickness' - which means speed and agility over
short distances, and an ability to think and react quickly in tight,
unscripted situations.
Dallas exploits that quickness with a flexible, attacking game that is
comfortable both running and passing the ball. In recent games, the <ORGANIZATION>Cowboys</ORGANIZATION>'
offence has been as swift, precise and potent as the <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> 49ers'
attack during their long reign in the <DATE>1980s</DATE> as the <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION>'s best team. The
comparison was not lost on some of the <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> players who faced the
Cowboys a fortnight ago. 'It looked like we were playing the mirror image of
ourselves at times,' said <PERSON>Jesse Sapolu</PERSON>, one of the 49ers' key offensive
players.
Although the bookmakers have installed the Cowboys as the favourites
tomorrow, many wise heads are warning that the Bills (who have been to, but
lost, the past two Super Bowls, the <DATE>1991</DATE> game by a single point) will have
much more big-game experience - <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> are the youngest team in the <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION>,
with an average age of 26.
Young they may be, but there is no shortage of confidence from the <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION>
players. As <PERSON>Emmitt Smith</PERSON>, their star 23-year-old running back, said so
disarmingly this week: 'Experience? How much experience do you need to play
in a Super Bowl? I've been running the ball my whole life. What more
experience do I need?'

FT  01 FEB 94 / Hire business drags down Christian Salvesen profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Christian Salvesen shares fell 62p to 314p after the UK distribution,
specialist hire and food services group issued a profits warning.
The Edinburgh-based group said <PERSON>Aggreko</PERSON> - its specialist hire business, which
has been a star performer in recent years - was suffering from increasing
competition in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>.
Salvesen warned that pre-tax profits for the year to <DATE>March</DATE> would be below
market expectations and 'slightly lower than the Pounds 74.8m reported last
year'. Analysts, who had been expecting around Pounds 80m, reduced their
forecasts to between Pounds 70m-Pounds 72m.
<PERSON>Mr Chris Masters</PERSON>, chief executive, identified four other factors hitting
profits: Unacceptable losses in <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> had led to the withdrawal of the
Aggreko business, with consequent redundancy costs and provisions for
possible bad debts;
The unexpected termination of a hire contract in <LOCATION>Croatia</LOCATION>, which was
producing all the electrical power for the town of Split;
A Pounds 1m stock write-down at Light and <ORGANIZATION>Sound Design</ORGANIZATION>, which the group
bought in <DATE>1991</DATE> and has since restructured after losses caused by a downturn
in the number of pop concerts;
Reduced volume in the group's vegetable processing activities because of
poor weather.
<PERSON>Mr Masters</PERSON> said most of the problems were one-offs, but Aggreko faced
continuing margin pressure in <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION>. Small operators had begun to
challenge at the bottom end of the hire plant market in power generators. At
the top end, competition was 'aggressive' from <ORGANIZATION>Caterpillar</ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> plant
manufacturer.
<PERSON>Mr Masters</PERSON> said steps have been taken to reduce Aggreko's cost base, cutting
the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> workforce of 350 by about 10 per cent. Sales were being refocused
towards bigger, higher-value contracts such as the <LOCATION>US Superbowl</LOCATION>, for which
Aggreko supplied the power at the <DATE>weekend</DATE>, and temperature control.
Salvesen said: 'By contrast, the group's distribution businesses around the
world, which comprise 45 per cent of trading profits, continue to make good
progress.' <PERSON>Mr Masters</PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION>Swift Distribution</ORGANIZATION>, acquired in <DATE>October</DATE> for
Pounds 84m, was performing ahead of expectations and Salvesen Brick was
continuing to experience increased demand and firmer prices.

   Wasserstein's Girl Talk
   ----
   By Donna Rifkind
</HL>
<DATE>

<SO>
WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A16

<LP>
   "Frankly, I have always found body hair a hassle." "I've
grown to hate my telephone." "Liking myself means liking diet
Jell-O." Where have we heard this before? It's the kind of
talk that's usually accompanied by Streisand on the stereo
and General Foods International Coffees, the kind that makes
a lot of men go, "Uh oh" and head for the Superbowl of
Motocross. It's that universal language called girl talk, and
it's what fills most of the pages of playwright Wendy
Wasserstein's first book of essays, "Bachelor Girls" (Knopf,
209 pages, $16.95).
   If there's one thing girl talk isn't, it's weighty, and
although Ms. Wasserstein throws in a few references to
Stendhal and Schopenhauer, to prove that nail-polish fumes
haven't completely destroyed her Mount Holyoke-educated
brain, most of the essays in Ms. Wasserstein's collection are
frivolous as can be. There are short pieces on manicures
("Nails: The Naked and the Red"), weight loss ("To Live and
Diet") and men's shopping habits ("Reflections on Leather
Rhinos"). There are candid confessions: We learn, for
instance, that Ms. Wasserstein's favorite perfumes include
L'Heure Bleue and Parure ("which, by the way, you can't get
in the States, even at Bergdorf's"), and that her underpants
of choice are Christian Dior lace-top panties.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   We may wonder why we've been elected to share these
intimacies. <PERSON>Wendy Wasserstein</PERSON> is, after all, a celebrity, a
well-known playwright whose hit show "The <PERSON>Heidi Chronicles</PERSON>"
won both a Pulitzer Prize and a Tony Award last year. Why is
she now in my living room, slathered in Nutribel Nourishing
Hydrating Emulsion and giggling about "The World's Worst
Boyfriends"?
   The answer has to do with that official organ of girl-talk
dissemination, the woman's magazine. Many of the essays in
"Bachelor Girls" originally appeared in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> Woman's
monthly column called "The Meaning of Life." The inspiration
for each probably emerged from a chat with some
celebrity-savvy editor who called to ask, "Hey Wen, what do
you say to giving us 1,500 words about plaid?" And so the
obliging <PERSON>Ms. Wasserstein</PERSON> produced "The Good, the Plaid, and
the Ugly," in which she makes startling disclosures about her
lifetime infatuation with you-know-what.
   To be fair, not all of the material in <PERSON>Ms. Wasserstein</PERSON>'s
book is quite this dippy. Anyone who has seen one of her
plays or read an interview with her knows she is earnest,
intelligent and likable -- and these qualities are partly
visible through the hairspray-misted air of "Bachelor Girls."
There even are a few serious meditations on babies vs.
career, AIDS, and women politicians. But most of the articles
are as lightweight as summer pajamas, and, read one after the
other, their cozy confidentiality is numbing. One of the
chief delights of occasional journalism ought to be the fact
that you only have to read it occasionally.
   Chances are anyone who caught one of <PERSON>Ms. Wasserstein</PERSON>'s
articles in its original form was leafing through magazines
at a beauty parlor. Unlikely as it seems, this venerable
institution now is a breeding ground for fiction writers.
<PERSON>Sarah Gilbert</PERSON>, a graduate of <ORGANIZATION>Farah's Beauty School</ORGANIZATION> and winner
of its "Most Perms in a Month" award, has written a novel
devoted entirely to the lives of small-town beauticians. As
<PERSON>Ms. Gilbert</PERSON> noted in a press release, "It didn't take a
genius to see that my background was absolutely perfect for
writing fiction. . . . I'm just as proud of my beauty license
as I am of my Master's Degree in English."
   <PERSON>Ms. Gilbert</PERSON>'s novel, ingeniously entitled "Hairdo"
(<ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION>, 243 pages, <MONEY>$17.95</MONEY>), is a madcap Southern burlesque,
a cross between "A Confederacy of Dunces" and the play "Steel
Magnolias." It features <PERSON>Miss Ruby McSwain</PERSON>, proprietress of
The Celebrity Styling Shop in <LOCATION>Stuckey</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>S.C.</LOCATION>, who dreams of
winning first prize at the Southeast Hair Show in <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>,
"the Olympics of hair." Her employees range from <PERSON>Yvonne
Tisdale</PERSON>, a bible-thumping beautician in space shoes, to blond
<PERSON>Ronder Jeffcoat</PERSON>, who's been relegated to giving bikini waxes
in the back room.
   "Hairdo" is awash in Dippity-Do and Happy Hair, perming
solution and mousse. All kinds of insider knowledge is on
display here, including the intricacies of the finger wave,
the petal curl and something called an updo. There also is an
unkind caricature of a homosexual "hair designer" named
<PERSON>Thurston</PERSON> who wears a pink lab coat and makes declarations
such as, "I can't breathe when I'm around paisley" (<PERSON>Wendy
Wasserstein</PERSON>, take note). Despite this bit of down-home
Southern prejudice, "Hairdo" has a weird, sunny energy and a
lot of style.
   One person who undoubtedly would be outraged by <PERSON>Ms.
Gilbert</PERSON>'s portrait of the prancing <PERSON>Thurston</PERSON> is <PERSON>Sarah
Schulman</PERSON>, the gay-rights activist whose <DATE>1988</DATE> offbeat murder
story, "After Delores," had its amusing moments. <PERSON>Ms.
Schulman</PERSON>'s latest novel, though, "People in Trouble" (<ORGANIZATION>Dutton</ORGANIZATION>,
228 pages, <MONEY>$17.95</MONEY>), is a mostly grim piece of propaganda
disguised as a love story between <PERSON>Kate</PERSON>, a married artist in
her 40s, and <PERSON>Molly</PERSON>, a possessive younger woman.
   There are some vivid descriptions of squalid summers in
downtown <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, but "People in Trouble" otherwise is just
a litany of pronouncements about the horrors of AIDS, the
homeless, urban development, homophobia and middle-class
apathy. This kind of editorializing, when unconvincingly
dolled up as fiction, is more likely to elicit indifference
than outrage. At the very least it makes you want to call up
<PERSON>Wendy Wasserstein</PERSON> and discuss facials.

FT  20 NOV 93 / Property (The Deep South): Jacuzzis at their best - Gerald
Cadogan finds grand houses for grand men in Atlanta
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUY A HOUSE in <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>USA</ORGANIZATION>, and you can let it in <DATE>1996</DATE> when the Olympic
Games come to town. Splendid houses are for sale in the city, those in the
northern suburbs grand enough to excuse any chairman for moving his home and
his corporate headquarters to the thriving capital and air hub of the
south-eastern <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>.
<LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION> began in <DATE>1733</DATE> when General Oglethorpe landed at <LOCATION>Savannah</LOCATION>, a place
where debtors were sent. The youngest and largest of the 13 states of the
original union, it was reluctant to secede from the Crown and in the civil
war looked for an alliance with <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> - an outlook mirrored in the
dominance of British styles in its grand houses.
In <DATE>1837</DATE> a town called Terminus was founded, becoming <LOCATION>Marthasville</LOCATION> in <DATE>1843</DATE>
and <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> in <DATE>1845</DATE>. Its position in the foothills at the south end of the
Appalachians made it the rail hub of the south east. General <PERSON>Sherman</PERSON>
destroyed this city in <DATE>1866</DATE> on his horrendous march 'from <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> to the
sea'.
When he stopped shelling, less than a tenth of the houses were intact. The
march to <LOCATION>Savannah</LOCATION> left a swathe of destruction 50 to 60 miles wide. His
attempt to annihilate the economy affected life in <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION> for years, and
southern memories for ever. But a pharmacist's cordial that became Coca-Cola
set <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> on the road to recovery.
By the <DATE>1920s</DATE>, the money it brought the city was being spent on stately
homes, mostly English-style, in the area north of the city centre where the
battle of <LOCATION>Peachtree Creek</LOCATION> took place in the civil war. Today what is good
for <ORGANIZATION>Coke</ORGANIZATION> is still good for <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>.
Three clever architects led the mansion building between the wars, so
successfully that there are bus tours round these suburban palaces. <PERSON>Philip
Shutze</PERSON> (rhyming with gutsy), <PERSON>Neel Reid</PERSON> and <PERSON>Lewis</PERSON> Crook produced intelligent,
sharply detailed <PERSON>Tudor</PERSON>, <PERSON>Queen Anne</PERSON> or Georgian - and some French or
Italian-style - buildings with allusions to grand houses in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>. They had
a good eye for siting. <LOCATION>North Atlanta</LOCATION> houses are in small wooded valleys with
creeks at the bottom, set well back from the road for privacy and security.
The large gardens are ablaze with azaleas and dogwood in the <DATE>spring</DATE> and in
<DATE>autumn</DATE> the 'man-made' woodland merges into the old natural forest so well
that you do not notice where one ends and the other begins.
It is suburbia, but at its best. Large, free-standing houses so close to
each other surprise Europeans who would expect each to be in its own park,
but their elegance and the beauty of the woods soon captivate. The property
market in <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> has been through a similar cycle to that in the UK. Prices
are well down from their 1987-88 peaks, realtor (estate agent) <PERSON>Harry Norman</PERSON>
said, as he has had to explain to vendors who would like their houses priced
at levels of five years ago. Unsurprisingly, some asking prices have been
cut. Where <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> differs from the <ORGANIZATION>UK</ORGANIZATION> is that, with the greater mobility of
the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> workforce, there are plenty of good houses on the market.
Many have super-expensive kitchens with free-standing 'island' counters and,
attached to the master bedroom, jacuzzis - I have never seen so many before
 -mirrored dressing rooms and large clothes cupboards that are complete
rooms. Nowadays, an agent remarked, the money that in the past went on the
reception rooms is spent on these private rooms.
The chairman moving his corporate headquarters might like to buy an early
<DATE>1920s</DATE> <PERSON>Neel Reid</PERSON> house, 2 <PERSON>Vernon Road</PERSON> on offer from <PERSON>Harry Norman</PERSON> at Dollars
2.495m. It has splendid public rooms, a porch modelled on <ORGANIZATION>Gunston Hall</ORGANIZATION>, in
<LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION>, a stepped garden leading to a creek, and swimming pool next to the
house.
To spend more, he could look at 65 <ORGANIZATION>Valley Road</ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION>Tudor</ORGANIZATION> house in immaculate
condition on a very large lot (9.5 acres), with its swimming pool so deep in
the woods that you would never know you were in the middle of a great city.
Built for the third president of <ORGANIZATION>Coca-Cola</ORGANIZATION>, it is now the home of <LOCATION>Edward</LOCATION> and
<PERSON>Suzanne Elson</PERSON>, who must sell as President <PERSON>Bill Clinton</PERSON> has nominated him
ambassador to <LOCATION>Denmark</LOCATION>.
With a great hall, wood panelling, and painted vaulted ceilings, and
surrounded by azaleas, boxwood, dogwood and rhododendrons, the asking price
is Dollars 6.75m from <PERSON>Jenny Pruitt</PERSON>. Property tax in <DATE>1992</DATE> was Dollars 21,042.
It is hard to see how the ambassador's residence in <LOCATION>Copenhagen</LOCATION> can match it.
Cheaper, and with the comforting feel of not having been revamped - house
and fittings are <DATE>1930s</DATE> - is 231 <LOCATION>Peachtree Battle</LOCATION>, for Dollars 1.25m from
<PERSON>Jenny Pruitt</PERSON>. Its pool is also next to the house. The garden is a treat,
planned as a series of rooms like <ORGANIZATION>Hidcote</ORGANIZATION>, in <LOCATION>Gloucestershire</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>,
(which of course an American, <PERSON>Lawrence Johnston</PERSON>, made) and with interesting
plants and a superb water garden around the creek at the bottom.
In <DATE>3645</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>Nancy Creek Road</ORGANIZATION> the white wood floored kitchen with reinforced
steel joists supporting the roof is like an exhibition pavilion. The pool
below is the other highlight. Also this house is a good example of extruded
mortar between the bricks, giving a rusticated texture that was news to me,
but is customary in <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION>. The price is Dollars 1.9m, and the agent <PERSON>Jenny
Pruitt</PERSON>. At the most expensive house 3640 Tuxedo Road (Dollars 9.5m from
<PERSON>Harry Norman</PERSON>) the old water garden, now overgrown, awaits resurrection. This
was once the house of <PERSON>Robert Woodruff</PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Coca Cola</ORGANIZATION>, sumptuous then
and made more sumptuous by the present owners. Five grand houses for five
chairmen or chief executive officers. If they buy next <DATE>weekend</DATE>, over the
Thanksgiving holiday, they will be in time to enjoy the Superbowl in <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>
in <DATE>January</DATE>.
Realtors in <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> (area code 404)<PERSON>Harry Norman</PERSON> (250-7505); <PERSON>Jenny Pruitt</PERSON>

FT  24 JAN 92 / Economic weight-watchers: The G7 meeting may be routine, but
the issues it faces are not
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The choice of venue says it all.
In <DATE>September 1985</DATE>, the finance ministers and central bank governors of the
world's leading industrial democracies met in <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION>'s prestigious Plaza
Hotel to launch a new chapter of international economic policy
co-ordination. Seventeen months later, in <DATE>February 1987</DATE>, they assembled
under the chandeliers of the <LOCATION>Louvre Palace</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> to announce a bold
currency stabilisation pact.
Tomorrow that co-ordination process continues - but in a <LOCATION>Long Island</LOCATION> suburb
of <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> within 20 minutes' drive of JF <LOCATION>Kennedy</LOCATION> airport.
The prolonged recession in the English-speaking countries and slow growth
elsewhere have presented the <ORGANIZATION>Group of Seven</ORGANIZATION> nations with bigger economic
problems than in the mid-1980s when their main concern was to push an
overmighty dollar lower. The collapse of communism in <LOCATION>eastern Europe</LOCATION> and the
break-up of the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> have thrown up challenges for the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>UK</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> that were undreamed of only three
years ago.
But tomorrow's meeting is likely to show that international economic policy
co-operation has only limited potential to change the world. The G7, which
some thought would evolve into a 'directorate' for the world economy after
the <ORGANIZATION>Louvre Accord</ORGANIZATION>, now works best as a forum for information exchange, with
the ministers and central bankers deciding their economic and monetary
policies according to the <PERSON>Sinatra</PERSON> doctrine of 'doing it my way'.
Officials preparing tomorrow's talks have stressed the routine character of
the meeting. For the past four years, the G7 has gathered around this time
to discuss the world economy and carry out the 'mutual surveillance' of each
economy's performance with the help of the <ORGANIZATION>International Monetary Fund</ORGANIZATION>
(IMF). Tomorrow's meeting will see another session of this economic
weight-watchers' club. After lunch, the discussion will focus on the
economic crisis in the former <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>.
The talks are due to finish after just six hours, so that <PERSON>Mr Nicholas Brady</PERSON>,
the <ORGANIZATION>US Treasury</ORGANIZATION> secretary, can join millions of other Americans in watching
the <LOCATION>Superbowl</LOCATION> on <DATE>Sunday</DATE>. The tight schedule will allow some visiting
ministers, including <PERSON>Mr Norman Lamont</PERSON>, the UK chancellor, to hurry to the
airport and home to deal with domestic political concerns.
On the other hand, it would be wrong to write off this latest instance of
high-level hobnobbing as no more than an expensive photo opportunity. While
the complexity of international events has apparently taught the G7
humility, adversity may be fostering solidarity.
Officials preparing the meeting hope that the atmosphere will be more
constructive than in recent G7 gatherings, which have been marked by
disputes between the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>'s strongest economy, over
economic policy priorities and how best to share the financial burden of
helping eastern <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> and the former Soviet republics move towards the
market economy.
The <ORGANIZATION>Bundesbank</ORGANIZATION>'s decision in <DATE>December</DATE> to raise its key interest rates to
levels last seen in the <DATE>1930s</DATE>, however, makes wholehearted agreement between
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Bonn</LOCATION> improbable. The <ORGANIZATION>US</ORGANIZATION> will press its main trading partners
to put greater stress on promoting economic growth, while the German
government, faced with a rash of double-digit pay claims, will underline its
determination to keep bearing down on domestic inflationary pressures.
But <ORGANIZATION>US Treasury</ORGANIZATION> officials, at least, believe the slowdown in growth in
<LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, and the absence of recovery in the recession-hit
English-speaking members of the G7, may contain the seeds of a new
international consensus on economic management that may solidify around the
time of the <DATE>spring</DATE> meetings of the <ORGANIZATION>IMF</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>late April</DATE>.
The <ORGANIZATION>US Treasury</ORGANIZATION> draws encouragement from the US-Japanese growth strategy
unveiled in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> earlier this month by <ORGANIZATION>US</ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON> and the
Japanese prime minister, <PERSON>Mr Kiichi Miyazawa</PERSON>. Although the agreement was
criticised by many as little more than a rehash of existing domestic policy
commitments, it bore some fruit last week in the shape of joint US-Japanese
action on the foreign exchange markets to curb the dollar's rise and limit
trade friction between the two countries.
However, there seems little chance that the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> and its European trade
partners will agree similar pacts in the near future. <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> will be unable
to start relaxing its tight monetary policy until wage pressures are brought
under control. The <ORGANIZATION>UK</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> must keep interest rates high, because they
are committed to keeping their currencies in the bands of the exchange rate
mechanism of the <ORGANIZATION>European Monetary System</ORGANIZATION>.
Nor have the G7 governments much fiscal room for manoeuvre. There are likely
to be some adjustments. Treasury officials in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> indicate that
President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s State of the <ORGANIZATION>Union</ORGANIZATION> message next <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> will signal fiscal
changes to boost growth in the short term in spite of the chronic <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> budget
deficit. With a general election looming, <PERSON>Mr Lamont</PERSON> is under growing
pressure to squeeze what fiscal stimulus he can from his <DATE>March 10</DATE> Budget.
And the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> may press <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> to relax fiscal policy to offset low growth this
year.
But these will be changes at the margin and unlikely in themselves to
reverse the steady scaling back of growth forecasts in the big industrial
countries.
The budgetary constraints confronting all industrialised democracies are one
reason not to expect agreement on large-scale financial assistance for
<LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> and the other former Soviet republics from the G7 meeting. Although
the Russian authorities and their western advisers have made impassioned
pleas for multi-billion dollar stabilisation funds to support the rouble and
<LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION>'s price reform, the G7 is unlikely to move before the republics have
become members of the <ORGANIZATION>International Monetary Fund</ORGANIZATION> and subject to <ORGANIZATION>IMF</ORGANIZATION>
discipline.
The prevailing view was summed up by <PERSON>Mr David Mulford</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>US Treasury</ORGANIZATION> under
secretary for international affairs, in an interview with <ORGANIZATION>BBC Television</ORGANIZATION>
<DATE>last weekend</DATE>. He warned that economic reform in the former <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>
would be a long process which could not be bought by simply pumping in
western financial assistance. It was premature to think, for example, of
forming a stabilisation fund for the rouble.
While senior G7 officials privately express grave concern about economic
developments in the former <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>, the ministers are unlikely to do
much more than push along the process of turning the republics into <ORGANIZATION>IMF</ORGANIZATION>
members. 'We hope to get to a point where the G7 ministers can agree on the
right parameters for entry,' one senior official said. A <ORGANIZATION>US Treasury</ORGANIZATION>
official said the G7's aim was to have <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> in the <ORGANIZATION>IMF</ORGANIZATION> in the next few
months.
Such a limited outcome would disappoint expectations in the former Soviet
republics and elsewhere. But G7 officials believe that the republics must do
more to make themselves attractive to western investors.
On the other hand, <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> is expected to warn that the economic and
political instability in the republics, and growing uncertainty about the
security of the former <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>'s nuclear arsenal, could be contributing
to the weakness of world growth by depressing investor and consumer
confidence.
There is little that finance ministers can do about the threat of nuclear
proliferation. But they can hope to boost confidence in other ways.
One would be to rekindle hopes that the <LOCATION>Uruguay</LOCATION> Round of trade
liberalisation talks can be brought to a speedy and successful end. More
than one G7 delegation has suggested making a strong statement about the
trade talks at the conclusion of the <LOCATION>Long Island</LOCATION> meeting.
However, the finance ministers have done this before, with little sign that
their appeals have had any effect on the negotiators in <LOCATION>Geneva</LOCATION>.
This time could be different, particularly if the finance ministers can
enlist their heads of government behind the cause of trade liberalisation.
As growth in the G7 countries converges near to zero, freer trade is one of
the few engines of recovery left to economic policymakers.

   COMPANIES GEAR UP for the disability law, but many remain
confused.
   Although the Americans with Disabilities Act won't take
effect until next July, Meridian Bank of Reading, Pa., has
begun to make its teller machines wheelchair accessible.
"We're blending our plan for compliance with existing plans
we have for replacing obsolete and outdated equipment," says
Joseph S. Pendleton III, senior vice president, adding that
compliance may add $300,000 to the bill. The law bars
discrimination in the hiring and serving of the disabled.

   <ORGANIZATION>Embassy Suites Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Irving</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, has put roll-in
showers and devices like vibrating alarm clocks in some
rooms. Refurbishing costs may range between <MONEY>$10,000</MONEY> for newer
hotels to <MONEY>$100,000</MONEY> for olders ones, says <PERSON>Jim Van Allen</PERSON>, vice
president. Still, many companies are unclear about
compliance. In a <DATE>July</DATE> poll of 484 companies, <PERCENT>29%</PERCENT> said they
were "uncertain" and <PERCENT>55%</PERCENT> said they haven't started to plan
for the law, says <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> law firm <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON>, <PERSON>Lewis</PERSON>,
<ORGANIZATION>Schnitzler &amp; Krupman</ORGANIZATION>, which conducted the poll.
   Embassy Suites also plans staff training in "disability
etiquette."
                                                                                                       

   LIBRARIES BORROW a not-for-profit strategy, and resort to
private money.
   While institutions like museums have long tapped private
purses, most libraries started doing so only recently. They
are prodded by dwindling public dollars -- which in <LOCATION>New York
City</LOCATION> has forced some branches for the first time to cut
services to three days a week -- and climbing costs of
computerization and books. But only <PERCENT>10%</PERCENT> of the nation's
15,000 public libraries have formed fund-raising arms, most
in the <DATE>last decade</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>American Library Association</ORGANIZATION> says.
   Others need funds to help them fill gaps in social
services. "But you can't look to the city to provide
funding," says <PERSON>Elliot Shelkrot</PERSON> of the Free Library of
<LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION>, which held a basketball contest to raise funds
for a youth outreach program. Private libraries aren't
immune. <ORGANIZATION>Cornell University</ORGANIZATION> math professors contribute
overtime pay so the math library won't have to reduce its
subscriptions. The <PERSON>Sidney</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Mont.</LOCATION>, public library benefits
from a calf bingo: Where the calf makes a "deposit" on a
giant board determines the winner.
                                                                                                       

   TAX BREAKS can make a state appealing, but don't draw
European firms.
   Investment-hungry states would do better to foster
industry and education than devise tax incentives, admonishes
a <ORGANIZATION>KPMG</ORGANIZATION> Peat Marwick report on European investment in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
European-owned companies cite proximity to key industries,
suppliers and air transport as the top reason for choosing a
specific location. Lower taxes came in twelfth. The study
adds that European managers here find the quality of labor a
cause for worry.
   "They believe states do welcome foreign investment, so
local regulations don't present as much of a problem for
them," says <ORGANIZATION>KPMG</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Pat Neil</PERSON>. But a separate Price Waterhouse
study warns that European companies weighing investment in
several states can find big differences in tax policies and
other regulations, which can be confusing. Nevertheless,
<LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> accounts for over half of foreign investment here.
   Investment growth has slowed -- to <PERCENT>6%</PERCENT> in <DATE>1990</DATE> from <PERCENT>16%</PERCENT> in
<DATE>1989</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Commerce Department</ORGANIZATION> data show.
                                                                                                       

   END AROUND: A travel package sponsored by <PERSON>Jose Cuervo
Tequila</PERSON> gives fans a chance to watch <DATE>January</DATE>'s Superbowl --
in <LOCATION>Cancun</LOCATION>, not <LOCATION>Minneapolis</LOCATION>, where the players will be. The
three-day excursion promises mariachi music, margaritas and,
yes, a giant screen on the beach so fans can tan and see the
game.
                                                                                                       

   EYE OF THE BEHOLDER: About <PERCENT>55%</PERCENT> of annual report readers
who also own stock prefer well-prepared documents that don't
cost a lot of money, according to a survey by <ORGANIZATION>Bruskin
Associates</ORGANIZATION>, an <LOCATION>Edison</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>, market researcher. One out of
four say the reports can even be stapled photocopies.
                                                                                                       

   MOSCOW MBAS: University of <LOCATION>Tulsa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Okla.</LOCATION>, is setting up a
graduate business school in a <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> suburb. It will teach
Western business methods but "culturalized for the Russian
students," says <PERSON>Robert Hisrich</PERSON>, who teaches entrepreneurship.
                                                                                                       

   GREENBACKS: Recreational use of company tracts adds
dollars to the till.
   For a fee or a lease, more companies -- from paper makers
to insurers -- open large landholdings to hunters, fishermen
and others with a yearning for the great outdoors.
<ORGANIZATION>International Paper Co.</ORGANIZATION> manages, among others, a "black
powder hunt" in <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION>, where hunters sport old weapons and
coonskin hats. It gets <MONEY>$10 million</MONEY> of revenue annually from
various leases on its 6.3 million acres of timberlands.
   <ORGANIZATION>Aquarion Co.</ORGANIZATION>, which has public water and environmental
testing labs, issues up to 4,000 fishing permits a year for
four of its reservoirs in <LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION>. It isn't a moneymaker,
but earns good will, a spokesman says. The practice is
expected to spread because of growing demand for access to
recreational land, particularly in the <LOCATION>East</LOCATION>, where public
acreage is scarcer, says <PERSON>Dr. Steve Anderson</PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION>Oklahoma
State University</ORGANIZATION> forestry associate professor.
   Calling it a "lucrative business," <PERSON>John Hancock</PERSON> Mutual
Life leases out 700,000 acres of timberlands.
                                                                                                       

   BRIEFS: About 60 cyclists will pit their legpower against
a 90-year-old steam engine this <DATE>Saturday</DATE> in a 60-mile race
from the <LOCATION>Grand Canyon</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Williams</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ariz</LOCATION>. Barring headwinds,
the cyclists are pegged to win. . . . <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Drake Hotel</ORGANIZATION>

   Fireworks and balloons filled <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>'s morning
sky <DATE>today</DATE> when the <ORGANIZATION>International Olympic Committee</ORGANIZATION> announced the
city will be the site of the <DATE>1996</DATE> Summer Olympics.
   Pandemonium broke out at the downtown retail-entertainment
complex called <LOCATION>Underground Atlanta</LOCATION>, where thousands of people
gathered to watch the announcement over televisions broadcasting
the <ORGANIZATION>IOC</ORGANIZATION> meeting live from <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>.
   Bright orange and green fireworks lighted the sky even though
the sun had already risen when the news came about <TIME>7:50 a.m.</TIME> The
boom of the fireworks could be heard throughout downtown.
   A band played the Olympic theme, and strangers hugged each
other.
   ``This was exciting. This was unbelievable,'' Mayor <PERSON>Maynard
Jackson</PERSON> said at a news conference in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> just after the vote.
``This proves that if you don't run the race, you don't have a
chance to win.''
   ``It's not my victory, it's a victory for <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>,'' said former
Mayor <PERSON>Andrew Young</PERSON>, who helped lead the campaign for the Olympics.
``We have to thank God and pray that we are worthy and that all of
the things that we have said, we can make come true.'' He also was
in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>.
   Atlanta entered the race late by most standards - in <DATE>1987</DATE> - with
nine volunteers. Some cities spent more money on the bids; for
example, <LOCATION>Athens</LOCATION> spent nearly <MONEY>$30 million</MONEY> compared with <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>'s
<MONEY>$750,000</MONEY>. And some spent more time: <LOCATION>Belgrade</LOCATION> entered the race in
<DATE>1985</DATE>.
   To win, a city needed 44 votes from the 88-member <ORGANIZATION>IOC</ORGANIZATION>.
   The committee's choice basically came down to the history and
tradition of <LOCATION>Athens</LOCATION> or the 21st century stadiums, communications
and commercial appeal of its rivals, which also included <LOCATION>Belgrade</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Yugoslavia</LOCATION>; <LOCATION>Manchester</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>; <LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Toronto</LOCATION>.
   According to a study done jointly by an accounting firm and the
<ORGANIZATION>University of Georgia</ORGANIZATION>, the Games would pump <MONEY>$3.5 billion</MONEY> over six
years into <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION>'s economy, add 85,000 jobs and create global
exposure.
   ``It made me feel I was making the Olympic team again,'' said
<PERSON>Evander Holyfield</PERSON>, the former Olympic boxer who is from <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>.
   Seconds after the announcement, crowds in <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> were six-deep
at an <ORGANIZATION>Atlanta Organizing Committee</ORGANIZATION> cart selling T-shirts and hats
with the city's Olympic logo.
   In the minutes before the announcement, the crowd alternated
between nervous silence and good-natured jeers as <ORGANIZATION>IOC</ORGANIZATION> President
<PERSON>Juan Antonio Samaranch</PERSON> fumbled with the card holding the name of
the host city.
   ``I wanted this so bad,'' said <PERSON>Janice Stockard</PERSON> of suburban
<LOCATION>Decatur</LOCATION>. ``I wanted it because <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>'s great. This means a lot.
We got the Superbowl (for <DATE>1994</DATE>) and now we got the Olympics.''
   ``I am absolutely amazed. I can't believe <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> has gone from
a place nobody thought had a chance to really getting those
games,'' said <PERSON>Michael Lomax</PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>Fulton County
Commission</ORGANIZATION>.
   Afterward, many in the crowd headed for work, but others hung
around to scoop up the last remaining souvenirs and to get started
on an all-day party planned for <LOCATION>Underground Atlanta</LOCATION>.

   <PERSON>Dick Frymire</PERSON>'s renowned rooster Ted
disgraced himself on national television when he predicted
<LOCATION>Cincinnati</LOCATION> to win the Super Bowl. But he's not quitting and should

   ``I tell everybody that Ted is the most famous unfried chicken in

telling yarns about Ted and offering folklore and advice on
everything from getting rid of roaches and squirrels to calming a

   For the TV picks, <PERSON>Frymire</PERSON> will put the names of about 50 shows in

with picks up to 10.
   Maybe that'll work out better than his Superbowl prediction,
which was made on national television, on <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION>' ``<DATE>Sunday</DATE> Morning.''

<PERSON>Walter Mondale</PERSON>. He set out some numbers and corn kernels, and asked
Ted how many states <PERSON>Mondale</PERSON> would carry in the election.
   Ted ate the kernel in front of the number ``1.''

<HEAD>Cable Industry Growing Into `Goliath'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After years of being considered the little
sibling of broadcast television, some say the cable TV industry is
beginning to look more like Goliath than <PERSON>David</PERSON>.
   Cable TV, now watched by more than <PERCENT>50 percent</PERCENT> of all American
households, has become a <MONEY>$12 billion</MONEY> industry that is gaining
viewers steadily, mostly at the expense of the broadcast networks.
   But with prosperity comes increased scrutiny, and in cable's
case <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> has been raising questions about concentration of
ownership within the industry, complaints of poor service and
rising rates. Some in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> say it may be time to reregulate
cable TV.
   ``We have to pay attention to this,'' <PERSON>James P. Mooney</PERSON>, president
of the <ORGANIZATION>National Cable Television Association</ORGANIZATION>, told an audience at
the opening session of the group's annual convention <DATE>Sunday</DATE>.
   ``We can't rebuff our friends,'' he said. ``An important part of
good business is good politics.''
   More than 13,000 people are expected to attend the convention,
which runs through <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
   Most governmental regulation has been lifted from the industry.
The most recent deregulation came in <DATE>January 1987</DATE> when most cable
systems were freed of municipal rate control. They now have more
control than ever on what viewers see and how much they pay.
   Deregulation brought increases in rates. The industry says the
average subscriber's bill rose <PERCENT>6.7 percent</PERCENT> in the first six months
after price control was lifted, but critics in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> cite
instances of rates going up by as much as <PERCENT>400 percent</PERCENT> in some
systems.
   Despite the increase, subscribers continued to sign on. Cable
systems added more than 4 million subscribers in <DATE>1987</DATE>, putting the
percentage of households receiving cable to nearly <PERCENT>52 percent</PERCENT> _
about 45 million households.
   Now that many cable companies have finished building their
systems _ wiring more than <PERCENT>80 percent</PERCENT> of the nation's households _
cable companies are starting to pay off their debt and are putting
their cash into programming.
   ``Programming is going to drive penetration,'' said <PERSON>James S.
Cownie</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Heritage Communications of Des Moines</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>,
and <ORGANIZATION>NCTA</ORGANIZATION> chairman.
   ``That's going to move us up to the <PERCENT>70 percent</PERCENT> saturation level
from <PERCENT>52 percent</PERCENT> where we are now.''
   The industry has been encouraged by the success of its early
efforts, like <ORGANIZATION>Showtime</ORGANIZATION>'s ``It's <PERSON>Garry Shandling</PERSON>'s Show,'' a comedy
series now on <ORGANIZATION>Fox Broadcasting Co</ORGANIZATION>.
   The show is one of only a few that have moved from cable to
broadcast. Most of the migration is still from broadcast to cable,
which has become home to many an old syndicated rerun.
   But cable executives say that will change as cable systems pour
more money into developing their own programs.
   ``We should be more concerned with what the content will be than
where it comes from,'' said <PERSON>Michael S. Fuchs</PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Home Box
Office</ORGANIZATION>.
   HBO received praise for its recent program ``Dear America:
Letters Home from <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>.''
   Cable TV, particularly the Entertainment and <ORGANIZATION>Sports Programming
Network</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>ESPN</ORGANIZATION>, also has been landing some big sports contracts.
Exclusive cable contracts for big sports events, though, have been
criticized for denying viewing of these games to those who don't
subscribe to cable. Before cable came along, these games could be
seen free on broadcast TV.
   But cable is likely to continue its foray into sports
programming.
   ``There are more first run movies and sports on cable, and
that's going to continue,'' said <PERSON>Fuchs</PERSON>. ``The only things that will
get some protection (from cable-exclusive contracts) are big sports
events like the Superbowl.''

   Lord Dentsu &amp; Partners, defying critics who questioned its
future, won one of advertising's biggest plums: Mazda Motor's
upscale Amati division, which is expected to bill about $75
million.
   Lord Dentsu bested four other agencies in snaring Amati, a
luxury line that will be introduced in the spring of 1994.
Chicago's Foote, Cone &amp; Belding, whose Santa Ana, Calif.,
office handles the Mazda account, had been considered a
front-runner. Others in the competition were Chicago's Tatham
RSCG; Jordan, McGrath, Case &amp; Taylor of New York; and the Los
Angeles office of New York's Della Femina McNamee.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The win increases Lord <ORGANIZATION>Dentsu</ORGANIZATION>'s billings by more than a
third to about <MONEY>$275 million</MONEY>, and gives its image a badly
needed boost. The agency, created a year ago by the merger of
two relatively weak shops, was considered a lightweight
competitor. Even some other agencies in the <ORGANIZATION>Amati</ORGANIZATION> pitch
figured it wasn't much of a threat. The agency is a joint
venture of <ORGANIZATION>Young &amp; Rubicam</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Dentsu</ORGANIZATION>.
   But <ORGANIZATION>Lord Dentsu</ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, has been quietly
building strength, especially in its <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> office. Last
<DATE>summer</DATE>, the office picked up the <MONEY>$30 million</MONEY> Dole account. In
<DATE>August</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Lord Dentsu</ORGANIZATION> brought in <PERSON>Leonard Pearlstein</PERSON>, who had
run his own now-defunct <LOCATION>West Coast</LOCATION> shop, as president and
chief operating officer of the company and head of the <LOCATION>Los
Angeles</LOCATION> office. That office will handle the <ORGANIZATION>Amati</ORGANIZATION> account.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Amati</ORGANIZATION> win "is going to help make this the next `place
to be,'" an exuberant <PERSON>Mr. Pearlstein</PERSON> said in an interview
yesterday. He said the agency is involved in several other
reviews, both in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> and in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, and added,
"We've been cooking pretty good in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>."
   <PERSON>Richard Lord</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Lord Dentsu</ORGANIZATION>'s chairman and chief executive
officer, will also be actively involved in the <ORGANIZATION>Amati</ORGANIZATION>
business, although he is based in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>: "I'll be racking
up the frequent-flier miles," he said. The victory is
especially sweet for <PERSON>Mr. Lord</PERSON>, a respected veteran adman who
has had a difficult few years, most recently as he toiled to
meld a single agency from the merger that created <ORGANIZATION>Lord
Dentsu</ORGANIZATION>.
   At <ORGANIZATION>Amati</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Richard Colliver</PERSON>, group vice president and
general manager, said <ORGANIZATION>Lord Dentsu</ORGANIZATION> was tapped because of its
"strategic thinking and planning." The account review was one
of the more unusual in recent years, because the ad agencies
never even saw the car. They instead were asked to create
hypothetical marketing plans for a hypothetical luxury
automobile. Among other attributes, the mythical car ranked
first in customer satisfaction.
   Lord <ORGANIZATION>Dentsu</ORGANIZATION> staffers were drinking champagne yesterday,
but the road ahead remains rough. <ORGANIZATION>Amati</ORGANIZATION> will introduce two
sedans in <DATE>1994</DATE> in an extraordinarily crowded market. The
<ORGANIZATION>Mazda</ORGANIZATION> unit's major competitors, <ORGANIZATION>Toyota</ORGANIZATION>'s Lexus, <ORGANIZATION>Nissan</ORGANIZATION>'s
Infiniti and <ORGANIZATION>Honda</ORGANIZATION>'s Acura, beat it to the luxury market by
several years. It also must battle with the European luxury
imports, including Mercedes and <ORGANIZATION>BMW</ORGANIZATION>. And it will face more
competition from revamped American luxury cars from <ORGANIZATION>Cadillac</ORGANIZATION>
and <LOCATION>Lincoln</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Mr. Colliver</PERSON> says <ORGANIZATION>Amati</ORGANIZATION> expects to sell 20,000 units in
<DATE>1994</DATE> and double that number in <DATE>1995</DATE>. And automobile analysts
and enthusiasts have high hopes for the as-yet-unseen car.
One participant in the review characterized it as a
dependable car with sexy styling. <PERSON>Christopher Cedergren</PERSON>, an
analyst with <ORGANIZATION>AutoPacific Group</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Santa Ana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, expects
the cars to be priced between <MONEY>$28,000</MONEY> and <MONEY>$45,000</MONEY> in today's
dollars and predicts sales of 50,000 a year by <DATE>1996</DATE>. Last
year, Lexus sold more than 71,000 cars, he says, while
Infiniti sold close to 35,000.
   The <DATE>1990s</DATE> "back-to-basics" trend "has been exaggerated,"
<PERSON>Mr. Cedergren</PERSON> says. "We're still going to have a lot of
affluent people out there."
   In winning the account, <ORGANIZATION>Lord Dentsu</ORGANIZATION> creates a potential
conflict with half-owner <ORGANIZATION>Young &amp; Rubicam</ORGANIZATION>, which handles <ORGANIZATION>Ford
Motor Co.</ORGANIZATION>'s big <ORGANIZATION>Lincoln-Mercury</ORGANIZATION> division. <ORGANIZATION>Lincoln-Mercury</ORGANIZATION>
executives couldn't be reached for comment.
   But in the past, <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> has allowed its ad agencies'
subsidiaries to handle car competitors only if the
competitor's potential sales were less than half of <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION>'s
sales in the same segment. <ORGANIZATION>Lincoln-Mercury</ORGANIZATION>'s upscale Lincoln
model sells about 200,000 cars each year, suggesting <ORGANIZATION>Amati</ORGANIZATION>
will become a problem only if it sells more than 100,000
cars.
   Some ad agency competitors suggested Lord <ORGANIZATION>Dentsu</ORGANIZATION> was
tapped because <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Mazda</ORGANIZATION> was comfortable with <ORGANIZATION>Lord
Dentsu</ORGANIZATION>'s part-Japanese ownership. But both <ORGANIZATION>Lord Dentsu</ORGANIZATION> and
<ORGANIZATION>Amati</ORGANIZATION> dismissed those suggestions as sour grapes.
   The losing agencies may be tempted to run headlong toward
<ORGANIZATION>Mercedes-Benz</ORGANIZATION>, currently in the midst of a review for its own
approximately <MONEY>$88 million</MONEY> account. But a <ORGANIZATION>Mercedes</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman
said four contenders already identified "are the finalists.
At this point, we aren't opening it up for any others." She
said a decision would be made late next month.

   <ORGANIZATION>Omnicom</ORGANIZATION> Buys <ORGANIZATION>Goodby
                                                                                                       

   Omnicom Group Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, the advertising holding company,
bought <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> agency <ORGANIZATION>Goodby Berlin &amp; Silverstein</ORGANIZATION>.
   Terms of the transaction weren't disclosed. <ORGANIZATION>Omnicom</ORGANIZATION> has
owned <PERCENT>37.5%</PERCENT> of <ORGANIZATION>Goodby</ORGANIZATION>'s shares outstanding since <DATE>1989</DATE>, an
interest it acquired in its white-knight acquisition of
British agency <PERSON>Boase</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Massimi</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Pollitt</PERSON>. In the latest
transaction, which <ORGANIZATION>Omnicom</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Bruce Crawford</PERSON> described
as "mainly cash," <ORGANIZATION>Omnicom</ORGANIZATION> bought the remaining <PERCENT>62.5%</PERCENT> of the
company from its four principals, <PERSON>Andy Berlin</PERSON>, <PERSON>Jeffrey
Goodby</PERSON>, <PERSON>Richard Silverstein</PERSON> and <PERSON>Colin Probert</PERSON>.
   An extraordinary two years of new business wins have
bolstered <ORGANIZATION>Goodby</ORGANIZATION>'s billings above the <MONEY>$200 million</MONEY> mark,
transforming it from a small regional shop into a national,
mid-sized agency. Agency Chairman and Chief Executive <PERSON>Andy
Berlin</PERSON> said, however, that because the agency hasn't handled
lucrative media purchasing for its clients, its revenues were
more like those of a small agency, <MONEY>$15 million</MONEY> to <MONEY>$18
million</MONEY>.
   <PERSON>Mr. Berlin</PERSON> said the acquisition brings the agency
"abilities a small <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> agency can't muster,"
including media-buying clout and additional marketing
services. "We are definitely expanding aggressively in <LOCATION>New
York</LOCATION> this year," he said. The agency's <LOCATION>New York-area</LOCATION> clients
include the New Yorker magazine, <ORGANIZATION>Heublein Inc.</ORGANIZATION>'s wine and
spirits and Royal Viking cruise lines.
   Goodby will operate as an independent <ORGANIZATION>Omnicom</ORGANIZATION> unit, as do
<ORGANIZATION>Omnicom</ORGANIZATION>'s other agencies, including <ORGANIZATION>BBDO</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>DDB Needham</ORGANIZATION> and
Tracey-Locke. "They're a craft-oriented agency, like the
other agencies in our group," <PERSON>Mr. Crawford</PERSON> said. "They fit
the culture of our group."

   In a media buying first, <ORGANIZATION>Coca-Cola Co.</ORGANIZATION> planned to kick off
its Olympics advertising blitz <TIME>this morning</TIME> with what it
calls the first global commercial, airing it simultaneously
on four continents.
   Called "Hellos," the 60-second, 12-language commercial,
from <ORGANIZATION>Interpublic Group</ORGANIZATION>'s McCann-Erickson, was to appear on
cable networks CNN and <ORGANIZATION>CNN International</ORGANIZATION> at <TIME>6:00 a.m. EST</TIME>
<DATE>today</DATE>, and in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New Zealand</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Latin America</LOCATION> at
the same time. For the rest of the day, four new Olympics ads
were to air at different times around the world on <ORGANIZATION>CNN</ORGANIZATION> and
<ORGANIZATION>MTV</ORGANIZATION>. The spots will break on <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> network television <DATE>Monday</DATE>.
   One of the Olympics spots depicts a fictional Lithuanian
cross-country skier at his first Olympics. The lush spot is
the first work of <PERSON>Gordon Bowen</PERSON>, the creative guru <PERSON>McCann</PERSON>
lured away from <ORGANIZATION>WPP Group's Ogilvy &amp; Mather</ORGANIZATION> last year to work
on its biggest account.

television ad campaign for <ORGANIZATION>Microsoft Windows</ORGANIZATION> operating system
and software applications, from the <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> office of <ORGANIZATION>WPP
Group's Ogilvy &amp; Mather</ORGANIZATION>. The ads are intended to show
potential business customers how easy the system is to use.
The <LOCATION>Redmond</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wash.</LOCATION>, company said it will spend <MONEY>$8 million</MONEY> on
the campaign from <DATE>March to June</DATE>.
                                                                                                       

   JOINT VENTURE: <ORGANIZATION>Interpublic Group</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>McCann-Erickson</ORGANIZATION> forged
a partnership with <ORGANIZATION>Guang Ming Newspaper Group</ORGANIZATION>, a daily
newspaper publisher in <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>, to form a joint venture ad
agency called McCann-Erickson (<LOCATION>China</LOCATION>) <ORGANIZATION>Ltd</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>McCann</PERSON> will hold a
<PERCENT>51%</PERCENT> stake in the new agency, with offices in <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Guangzhou</LOCATION>.

   SUPER CHANNEL XXVI: Banks of televisions known as "video
walls" have been installed in <LOCATION>Minneapolis</LOCATION>'s 20 miles of
indoor walkways and will show Super Bowl guests and others
ads from companies including <ORGANIZATION>Northwest Airlines</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Prudential
Securities</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Dayton Hudson Corp.</ORGANIZATION> units Target and <ORGANIZATION>Dayton's</ORGANIZATION>.
The spots, aired with highlights from the <DATE>1991</DATE> football
season, went for <MONEY>$9,500</MONEY> for the 10-day run, reaching an
estimated 200,000 passers-by a day.

   History will judge that the U.S. fulfilled its destiny in
thwarting the dark side with orchestrated precision,
humanity, technology, diplomacy, perseverance, morality,
courage and intelligence.
   But several atrocities will never make the history books.
The broadcast media are responsible for breeding divisiveness
in our nation. The offspring of a generation of media that
affected the dying stage of a previous war, they are now
vying for a role as an additional antagonist -- not simply
serving the public interest.

   On <DATE>Jan. 13</DATE>, <PERSON>Charles Kuralt</PERSON> on <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION> interviewed a young
reservist who declared herself a conscientious objector after
her unit was sent to <LOCATION>Saudi Arabia</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Mr. Kuralt</PERSON> never asked why
she waited to object until her unit crossed "Harm's Way" --
why she collected her reservist checks for all the prior
years.
   On <DATE>Jan. 13</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION> allowed the Physicians for Social
Responsibility (in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>) to broadcast a 30-second
commercial showing a loaded body bag in an effort to rid the
American public of its will to exercise its national policy
and global obligations. Was this barbaric visual necessary?
   On <DATE>Jan. 15</DATE>, <PERSON>Tom Brokaw</PERSON> on NBC-TV interviewed wives of <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION>
pilots in the <LOCATION>Gulf</LOCATION>. When their responses to his questions
illustrated courage, resolve and support, <PERSON>Mr. Brokaw</PERSON> told the
women how "well trained" they were.
   On <DATE>Jan. 16</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Bryant Gumbel</PERSON> attempted to stir the
embers of racial disharmony in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and perhaps on the
battlefield by broadcasting an interview with a black pastor
claiming that the ratio of blacks in the military was
discriminatory. Maybe he should have interviewed Chief of
Staff <PERSON>Colin Powell</PERSON> about our current volunteer force.
   On the evening of <DATE>Jan. 16</DATE>, Channel 13 in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> had a
guest who told viewers that by daybreak the Gulf area would
be the biggest POW camp ever or a cemetery.
   Just prior to the war's start, <PERSON>Joe Garagiola</PERSON> went to an
<ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> post to interview children of GIs in the <ORGANIZATION>Gulf</ORGANIZATION>, and asked

   I applaud the TV networks for their dedicated and often
insightful coverage of the Gulf war, but they are going too
far. In their efforts to outdo one another in dramatizing the
war, the networks are becoming a national-security risk to
the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> and other allies. The most enthusiastic
viewer of all is probably <PERSON>Saddam Hussein</PERSON>, glued to a TV set
in his elusive command bunker.
   After the initial <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> air attack on <LOCATION>Baghdad</LOCATION>, broadcasters
effectively taunted Saddam into retaliation. Network
commentary focused on the ease of victory, <ORGANIZATION>Saddam</ORGANIZATION>'s
unexpected impotence and the probability of a short-and-sweet
resolution of hostilities. Newscasters noted that Saddam
seemed to have forgotten his promise of a retaliatory attack
on <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION>. For a man whose leadership has been created and
perpetuated by images of machismo and power, such words could
provoke action.
   In the "dead spaces" between <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> air raids and Iraqi
missile launches, the networks have summoned a veritable army
of experts to serve as military analysts-soothsayers-fortune
tellers. Entering the realm of video conferencing as a means
of military second-guessing can be a dangerous business.
Questions such as these were presented in the wake of attacks
on <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION>: Which neighborhoods did Iraqi Scud missiles hit in
<LOCATION>Tel Aviv</LOCATION>, and what obvious targets were missed? If <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION>
wants to make a strong statement to <PERSON>Saddam Hussein</PERSON>, what
targets should it select in <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION>?
   Probably even more shocking has been the media's obsession
with the potential use of chemical weapons. If this obsession
turns into a self-fulfilling prophecy, <PERSON>Saddam Hussein</PERSON> will
exploit his arsenal of nerve gas and other chemical agents
and provide us with television footage of unimaginable
suffering and death.
   At the beginning and conclusion of network newscasts, we
are met with bold, three-dimensional graphics bearing such
enticing titles as "The Desert Crisis" and "Showdown in the
Gulf." Stirring music plays as the titles advance and retreat
from focus, reminiscent of the video heraldry of the
Superbowl or the Olympics. Let us be reminded, however, that
this is not a sporting event. This is the ugly theater of
war, and the media have the power to get people killed.

<LEADPARA>  THERE IS grumbling amid the scribbling set about the endless stream of
homecoming parades for Desert Storm vets. It has been pointed out that the
celebrations are lasting longer than the war.;    One critic sees the hype and
the hoopla as "warnography," i.e., "the glorification of war, warriors and war
machines" and "excessive wallowing in glee over a military victory." The more
easily alarmed see a helium-filled M-1 tank, a papier-mache Patriot float by
and feel a wave of militarism sweeping the country.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  DON'T WHINE -- ON THE -- PARADE
IT BEATS RAPE AND PILLAGE AS A VICTORY CELEBRATION  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Commentary
Charles Krauthammer is a Washington Post columnist.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     To which I say: Loosen up, guys. Historically, the reward for victorious
armies is the conquered country, theirs for rape and pillage and general
mayhem. Indeed, this style is not just historical. It is how most winners
still do it. It is how Iraqis do it (in <LOCATION>Kuwait</LOCATION> and Kurdistan), how Liberians
do it, how Ethiopians will be doing it.;    Americans don't do it that way
anymore, at least not since <PERSON>Sherman</PERSON>'s march (described by <PERSON>James McPherson</PERSON> as
"a frolic, a moving feast" and by a Union officer as "the most gigantic
pleasure excursion ever planned"). What do we now offer soldiers who have just
spent seven harrowing months risking their lives on our behalf? A ride in an
open car preceded not by slaves in chains but by pink-cheeked cheerleaders
flashing pom-poms.;    This is militarism? Somehow, I don't think this is how
the Prussians did it. Moreover, part of the merriment has a serious purpose:
expiation for our shabby treatment of <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> vets. The parades in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>,
Hollywood and elsewhere were explicitly open to all veterans as a way of
including <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> vets in a genuinely feelgood event. Including the soldiers
of a lost war in the rah-rah turns a celebration of victory into a homage to
sacrifice.;    But even where it is a celebration of victory, why not?;   
What happened in <LOCATION>Kuwait</LOCATION> was an extraordinary military victory. The critics now
sneering that <ORGANIZATION>Iraq</ORGANIZATION> was an overestimated pushover are, by and large, the same
group that six months ago were warning that <ORGANIZATION>Iraq</ORGANIZATION> was a fearsome powerhouse,
Saddam a wily general, and our desert army his next victim. Yesterday they
said <LOCATION>Kuwait</LOCATION> was going to be <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>. Now they say it was <LOCATION>Grenada</LOCATION> all along.;  
 In fact, the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and its allies defeated a formidable force that
had just spent eight years holding off and then subduing an enemy (<LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION>) three
times its size. When a nation scores the second most stunning military victory
of the century (after the Six Day War), it has every right to celebrate.;   
What are the critics so lathered up about? Triumphalism? The Romans knew how
to put on a triumph: The general wore a golden crown, the enemy marched in
chains and wagons of booty brought up the rear. Today's endlessly televised,
absurdly choreographed Hollywood parades given to patriotic crooning by
second-string soap stars are not triumphs.;    <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s genius, on display at
every wacky welcome-home TV special -- in one parade, <PERSON>Martha Raye</PERSON> waved her
false teeth to the crowd -- is not militarism but show biz. This isn't Triumph
of the Will. This is <LOCATION>Gilligan</LOCATION>'s Island.;    <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> is a cultural Cuisinart,
taking anything of taste and distinction and turning it to mush. Our great
national talent is not glorifying but trivializing. It is hard to get agitated
about extravagant parades during a week when <PERSON>Henry Kissinger</PERSON> plays guest
weatherman on the <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION> morning show. This is a country whose former speaker of
the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> pops out of suitcases in TV ads. This, after all, is the land of the
<LOCATION>Superbowl</LOCATION>, a national festival of excess.;    Glorification? Two months ago,
<PERSON>Norman Schwarzkopf</PERSON> was the greatest American war hero since Ike. Today he is
grand marshal of the <ORGANIZATION>Kentucky Derby Festival Parade</ORGANIZATION>. In between, he has been
made to chat with <PERSON>Barbara Walters</PERSON>, link arms with <PERSON>Mickey Mouse</PERSON> and become
honorary knight of Elizabeth II of <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>. Next, the Indy 500. In most
countries, a court-martialed corporal can expect more leniency.;    Director
<PERSON>Billy Wilder</PERSON> once came to <PERSON>Sam Goldwyn</PERSON> with the idea of doing a biography of
<LOCATION>Nijinsky</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Goldwyn</PERSON> said he was not about to invest in a movie about a man who
had ended up in a mental institution believing he was a horse. "Not to worry,"
said <PERSON>Wilder</PERSON>. "My version will have a happy ending. We wind up showing him
winning the <LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION> Derby.";    Subtlety is not our strong suit. Hence
<PERSON>Wilder</PERSON>'s dictum on subtlety in movies: "Of course, there must be subtleties.
Just make sure you make them obvious.";    We always do. Obviousness is the
ultimate American vice, and, as national failings go, a small one. So relax:
Raise a glass, tip a hat, wave a pom-pom to the heroes of Desert Storm. If
that makes you feel you're living in <LOCATION>Sparta</LOCATION>, have another glass.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>
   President <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> shed a symbolic burden at the
<LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> summit that he had carried for five years _ his own
description of the <ORGANIZATION>Kremlin</ORGANIZATION> as an ``evil empire.''
   It was a remark that <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> had uttered only once, but it had
burned in the Soviet consciousness since <DATE>1983</DATE>, an oft-quoted and
inescapable reminder of superpower tensions. Finally, to the private
delight of <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> officials, it was gone.
   ``That was a different time, a different era,'' <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> said,
standing on the cobblestones of <LOCATION>Red Square</LOCATION> alongside <PERSON>Mikhail S.
Gorbachev</PERSON>, the architect of ambitious social and economic changes
that the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> wants to encourage.
   Reagan's repudiation bolstered the already-improved ties between
the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> and cleared the stage for another
president to move in next <DATE>January</DATE> to manage superpower relations,
unfettered by the rhetorical extremes of his predecessor.
   <PERSON>Gorbachev</PERSON> took immense satisfaction in <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>'s retraction. He
quoted a Greek philosopher as saying, ``Everything flows, everything
changes.''
   Indeed, the word ``change'' is an understatement for what has
happened in the remarkable 30-month summit relationship of <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>
and <PERSON>Gorbachev</PERSON>.
   The two superpowers, owners of the world's deadliest arsenals of
nuclear weapons, have made a dramatic leap, from open hostility and
isolation to warmth and frequent contacts at the highest level.
   Make no mistake, there still are deep differences. The
superpowers are deadlocked over terms of a strategic arms reduction
treaty (START), and <PERSON>Gorbachev</PERSON> bridled at <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>'s lectures about
human rights in the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>.
   The Soviet leader said that the <ORGANIZATION>Kremlin</ORGANIZATION> ``will not accept any
advice on how to run our affairs. We do not need anyone else's
model. We do not need anyone else's values.''
   Yet, things are different.
   Since the first Reagan-Gorbachev meeting in <DATE>1985</DATE>, superpower
summitry has become so routine that <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> officials are not
embarrassed by the fact that the latest meeting did not produce any
breakthroughs or concrete achievements.
   ``We can't give you a Superbowl game every couple of weeks or
months,'' said Lt. Gen. <PERSON>Colin Powell</PERSON>, the president's national
security adviser.
   ``We have to take this slowly, this is too important to rush,''
<PERSON>Powell</PERSON> said. ``In the next six months, the next six years, if you
don't come home with a (START) treaty that the experts, the
<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>, don't see as strong ... it'll never be ratified.''
   There is little likelihood a START treaty will be concluded under
<PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>.
   With time running out on his administration, the negotiators will
not return to <LOCATION>Geneva</LOCATION> until <DATE>July 12</DATE> to resume negotiations.
   ``We set no deadline,'' <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> said. ``You don't make a treaty
just to simply have it be achieved at a certain point in time.''
   However, <PERSON>Powell</PERSON>, talking with reporters on <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> One as
<PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> flew back to <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, said U.S.-Soviet relations now are
``solidly in place without a lot of ups and downs, without too many
sharp turns that cause people to have anxiety. It is a fairly
stable, maturing, growing relationship.''
   To underscore his point, <PERSON>Powell</PERSON> noted that Secretary of State
<PERSON>George P. Shultz</PERSON> has had something like 26 meetings with his Soviet
counterpart, <PERSON>Eduard Shevardnadze</PERSON>.
   In the absence of concrete achievements, <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> officials
said <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>'s real accomplishments were his appearances before
Soviet students, intellectuals, dissidents, writers and monks at the
<PERSON>Danilov</PERSON> monastery. He argued for greater freedom for the Soviet
people and respect for human rights.
   ``I submit to you that that is real substance,'' <PERSON>Powell</PERSON> said.
``When you can take that kind of message directly to the people of
the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> in the person of the president of the <LOCATION>United
States</LOCATION>, that goes well beyond form, that goes well beyond style.
That is substance.''
   Yevgeny Yevtushenko, a well-known Soviet poet, emphasized the
symbolic importance of <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>'s appearances.
   ``<PERSON>Mr. Reagan</PERSON> doesn't belong to the kind of intellectual elite. He
represents the ordinary American people, he speaks for the silent
majority,'' <PERSON>Yevtushenko</PERSON> said in <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> <DATE>last week</DATE>.
   ``If he takes the first step into the <ORGANIZATION>Kremlin</ORGANIZATION>, it was the
so-called American people _ they made the step, too,'' <PERSON>Yevtushenko</PERSON>
said.
   The summit appeared to be an exhausting experience for the
77-year-old <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>.
   He acknowledged he returned home tired, but said he was
exhilarated. ``The events of this week in <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> were momentous. Not
conclusive, perhaps, but momentous,'' <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> said.
   <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>, who refused to meet with <PERSON>Gorbachev</PERSON>'s three predecessors,
attributed most of the evolution in U.S.-Soviet relations to
<PERSON>Gorbachev</PERSON>, a leader who, the president said, is ``a serious man,
seeking serious reform.''
   <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> also said in a speech in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> that the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION> should
``embrace honest change when it occurs, but let us also be wary and
ever vigilant.''
   That responsibility soon will be passed to Democrat <PERSON>Michael
Dukakis</PERSON> or Republican <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON>, whoever wins the presidential
election in <DATE>November</DATE>.
   ``I think it's a relationship that will be built on by the next
administration, regardless of which party wins the election,''
<PERSON>Powell</PERSON> said.
   He said that <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> will continue working actively with <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>,
``But at the same time, it would be not smart of them not to begin
thinking about the next administration. It also would be not awfully
responsible of us not to begin preparing them for the next president.
   ``As we get later into the year,'' <PERSON>Powell</PERSON> said, ``we'll start to
do our own transition activities to the next president ... to make
sure that this relationship, this transition (occurs) in a smooth,
satisfactory way.''

<HEAD>EDITOR'S NOTE: Terence Hunt has covered Ronald Reagan since his</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   President <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> shed a symbolic burden at the
<LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> summit that he had carried for five years _ his own
description of the <ORGANIZATION>Kremlin</ORGANIZATION> as an ``evil empire.''
   It was a remark that <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> had uttered only once, but it had
burned in the Soviet consciousness since <DATE>1983</DATE>, an oft-quoted and
inescapable reminder of superpower tensions. Finally, to the private
delight of <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> officials, it was gone.
   ``That was a different time, a different era,'' <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> said,
standing on the cobblestones of <LOCATION>Red Square</LOCATION> alongside <PERSON>Mikhail S.
Gorbachev</PERSON>, the architect of ambitious social and economic changes
that the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> wants to encourage.
   Reagan's repudiation bolstered the already-improved ties between
the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> and cleared the stage for another
president to move in next <DATE>January</DATE> to manage superpower relations,
unfettered by the rhetorical extremes of his predecessor.
   <PERSON>Gorbachev</PERSON> took immense satisfaction in <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>'s retraction. He

JIM MURRAY: PLAYOFFS EASY TO PREDICT

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Now that the <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> playoffs are almost upon us, it's time to reflect not only on 
what may happen but on what probably will. For instance: 
</P>
<P>
1. Two teams will struggle for 58 minutes to a 10-7 score featured by a 
rock-ribbed pass rush, but in the last two minutes, resorting to exotic 
defenses, each team will be scored on twice. The coaches will see no 
correlation between the scoring and defense but will hail instead the 
"two-minute drill" of the victors, ignoring the fact the <ORGANIZATION>Mack Sennett Cops 
Drill defense</ORGANIZATION> will have far more to do with it. 
</P>
<P>
2. The <ORGANIZATION>NFC</ORGANIZATION> will win the Super Bowl, 40-10. 
</P>
<P>
3. Fans who stood in the snow or sleet all night to get tickets will be treated 
to two to four minutes of a quarterback falling on the football or kneeling out 
the clock, causing old-timers to mutter darkly, "<PERSON>Johnny Unitas</PERSON> never fell on a 
football in his life." 
</P>
<P>
4. A team with five 9.4 sprinters at the flanks and a <PERCENT>62%</PERCENT> passer at the wheel 
will get to the five-yard line and send a 180-pound running back hurtling into 
the middle of two tons of massed mastodonic defense three times and have to 
settle for a humiliating field goal. 
</P>
<P>
5. If the run-and-shoot offense gets to the finals or even close to it, 21 of 
the 28 teams will go to it next year. 
</P>
<P>
6. The best quarterback will win the Super Bowl, not necessarily the best team. 
See about <PERSON>Warren Moon</PERSON> because all his team has to do is hold the opposition 
under 21 points. But if <PERSON>Joe Montana</PERSON> gets the ball in the <DATE>last 30</DATE> seconds 
needing only a field goal to win, go home and beat the traffic. It's over. 
</P>
<P>
7. Two coaching staffs will work around the clock for a week, designing 
offensive or defensive schemes and elaborate zones and confusing splits, but 
three or more games will be decided because nobody can fall on a fumble. 
</P>
<P>
8. Hope that the <LOCATION>Philadelphia Eagles</LOCATION> somehow find a way into the playoffs 
because <PERSON>Randall Cunningham</PERSON> with the football is Magic <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> bringing the ball 
upcourt, <PERSON>Gene Kelly</PERSON> dancing in the rain or <PERSON>Willie Mays</PERSON> with a 3-and-2 count. 
What you came to see. 
</P>
<P>
9. Three out of five overtime games -- make that five out of five -- will be 
decided by a field goal, which means that the game will be decided by the coin 
flip because defending teams will forget that the goal line in that situation 
is their 35 and not the one. 
</P>
<P>
10. The <LOCATION>Buffalo Bills</LOCATION>, everyone's favorite to go to the Super Bowl, won't. 
</P>
<P>
11. The crowd will be a factor in at least three games, which means the 
visiting quarterback has to face not only 11 hostile players but 70,000 
full-throated fans, but the officials who would penalize a player who roughed 
up a quarterback for unsportsmanlike conduct lets the customers rough the 
quarterback all they want. 
</P>
<P>
12. The <ORGANIZATION>New York Giants</ORGANIZATION> won't lose to the 49ers again. 
</P>
<P>
13. With six wild-card teams, the chances are good one of them will be a Super 
Bowl contender, and maybe both will. The statistic that the Raiders are the 
only wild-card team ever to win the Super Bowl will be brought up 711 times 
Super Bowl week. 
</P>
<P>
14. If <LOCATION>Seattle</LOCATION> gets in the playoffs, it will win or lose at least one game with 
only two seconds remaining on the clock. 
</P>
<P>
15. If <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> gets in the playoffs, <PERSON>Joe Gibbs</PERSON> will outcoach the guy across 
the field from him -- unless that guy is <PERSON>Don Shula</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
16. <PERSON>Mike Ditka</PERSON> will blame the media if his quarterback throws five 
interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
17. <PERSON>Mike Ditka</PERSON>'s quarterback will throw five interceptions. <PERSON>Mike Ditka</PERSON> will 
throw a tantrum. 18. There will be a lot of red faces around the league if the 
<LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> Cowboys find their way into the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
19. Games won against <ORGANIZATION>New England</ORGANIZATION> should not count in computing eligibility for 
the playoffs. Games won against <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> should count only half. Beating Denver 
at sea level should count as a tie. 
</P>
<P>
20. <LOCATION>Kansas City</LOCATION> will surprise a lot of people. But then, it already has. 
</P>
<P>
21. If <PERSON>Bo Jackson</PERSON> gets in a Super Bowl, the other 21 players might as well play 
with a bag over their heads. 
</P>
<P>
22. If <LOCATION>Cincinnati</LOCATION> falls by the wayside again, shouldn't <PERSON>Boomer Esiason</PERSON> be 
called <PERSON>Buster Esiason</PERSON>? 
</P>
<P>
23. If the <ORGANIZATION>Pittsburgh Steelers</ORGANIZATION> get in the playoffs, shouldn't <PERSON>Chuck Noll</PERSON> at 
least smile once in a while? He always looks as if he just heard his house was 
on fire. 
</P>
<P>
24. When the <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> Bills are in the game, the best player on the field will 
be a defensive end. <PERSON>Bruce Smith</PERSON> thinks he's the best player in the game, and I 
agree with him. He has moves we haven't seen since <ORGANIZATION>Deacon Jones</ORGANIZATION>. If the head 
slap were still legal, he'd make every tackle. He almost does anyway. 
</P>
<P>
25. If <PERSON>Joe Montana</PERSON> completes a bomb to <PERSON>Jerry Rice</PERSON>, look for the announcers to 
talk learnedly about how he "read the defensive set" when the truth of the 
matter is, <PERSON>Joe</PERSON> just said in the huddle, "OK, everybody out for a long one." 
</P>
<P>
26. Another announcer will say a cornerback "blew the coverage" when the truth 
is, no one running backward can run as fast as <PERSON>Jerry Rice</PERSON> running forward. 
</P>
<P>
27. At least one game will be played in life-threatening weather. Not 
threatening to the players, to the fans. 
</P>
<P>
28. The Super Bowl, which has been won 17 of the 24 times by "grandfather" 
franchises, i.e. teams existing before the formation of the <ORGANIZATION>American Football 
League</ORGANIZATION> (the figure is 20 out of 24 if you throw out three of the <ORGANIZATION>Minnesota 
Vikings</ORGANIZATION>' losses to the upstarts), will lose its mystique if the "other" league 
doesn't get more competitive. The facts of the matter are that, of the truly 
old-line football families, only the <LOCATION>Washington Redskins</LOCATION>, Rams and <LOCATION>Philadelphia 
Eagles</LOCATION> have ever lost in the Super Bowl. In the last six <LOCATION>Super Bowls</LOCATION>, the count 
has been: the Establishment (NFC) 240, the New Kids on the Block (AFC) 82. If 
that's a contest, so was <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> against the Low Countries.

   HERE IT COMES, the great leap that even <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION> children now mimic. 
<PERSON>James "Mack" McIngvale</PERSON> is standing before a camera at <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION>'s Channel 39, talking so fast his gestures seem out of sync. 

   "Why do I have these bags under my eyes? 
Why do I look tired and drained?" he cries. 
"Because I've been busy marking down prices for our Memorial Day sale, that's why!" 
The cameraman bends over and splays his hands under the lense, dropping fingers one by one to count the remaining seconds. 
Nine, eight, seven. . . . 
"My eyes are tired, but the values are yours!" 
Mack says. 
"And remember, Gallery Furniture Saves . . . 
You . . ." And here it is. 
Mack leaps into the sky. 
Airborne, he grabs a roll of money from his back pocket and punches it toward the camera. 
"Gallery Furniture Saves . . . 
You . . . 
Mmmmmoney!" 

   A keeper. 

   But <PERSON>Mr. McIngvale</PERSON>'s grin fades quickly; his face goes dour. 
He loves doing these commercials, but he needs to conserve energy. 
In three hours, he will shoot 25 commercials for his <ORGANIZATION>Gallery Furniture</ORGANIZATION> store, each ad-libbed on the spot. 
A rubber chicken lies supine off-screen, awaiting its debut later in the series. 
Says <PERSON>Sean O'Neel</PERSON>, who will appear today opposite <PERSON>Mr. McIngvale</PERSON> in a commercial, "These are the ads every ad agency in town hates and every retailer loves." 

   They're called "screamers." 
<PERSON>Lee Iaccoca</PERSON> can afford to hire big-time agencies and spend months and millions on television campaigns, but small-business men can't. 
Instead, they take the low road, getting the word out through kitsch and pure bravado, starring in ads they write and produce themselves. 
In <LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION>, for example, <PERSON>Mel Farr</PERSON>, an automobile dealer and former <ORGANIZATION>Detroit Lions</ORGANIZATION> running back, takes to the skies as the "Superstar" dealer. 
"A black man in a cape on TV selling automobiles, that has to be unique," he says. 

   The screamers buy cheap air. 
They scream from the "fringe," trade slang for the periods just before and just after the prime morning and evening hours. 
They haunt graveyard TV, the <TIME>1 a.m.</TIME> to 4 a.m. stretch. 
Some do their screaming on cable. 
Time is cheap, too, in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s remote TV outposts. 
There are 212 television markets in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>, the first -- the largest -- being <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, the last being <LOCATION>Glendive</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>. 
This is <PERSON>Kraig Erickson</PERSON>'s turf. 
The owner of <PERSON>Don</PERSON>'s Shoes, <PERSON>Mr. Erickson</PERSON> poses as a bunny in his Easter commercials. 
In his 10 years of advertising on <LOCATION>Glendive</LOCATION>'s KXGN-TV, he has paid as little as <MONEY>$8</MONEY> for a 30-second spot. 
By contrast, 30 seconds during the last Superbowl cost advertisers <MONEY>$645,000</MONEY> -- <MONEY>$21,500</MONEY> a second. 

   Cut-rate commercials are not slick. 
And what they lack in sophistication, well, they also often lack in taste. 
Says <PERSON>Mike Davis</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Prime Productions</ORGANIZATION>, a video studio in <LOCATION>Upper Darby</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pa.</LOCATION>, "Nobody ever said you had to have taste to be successful." 

   Take <PERSON>Ben Krass</PERSON>. 
Please. 

   The owner of <ORGANIZATION>Krass Bros.</ORGANIZATION> men's and boys' stores in <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION>, he's been doing his own commercials for 20 years. 
In one of his early spots, he climbed into a casket and played dead. 
As he was carried before the camera, he sat up and stared into the lens. 
"If you gotta go," he told viewers, "go in a <ORGANIZATION>Krass Brothers</ORGANIZATION> suit." 

   Lately, <PERSON>Mr. Krass</PERSON> has been favoring more lively props. 
"Amazons! 
You understand what I mean?" he says. 
He is referring to the women who carried him from a more-recent commercial. 
"They gotta be Amazons. 
Nobody under six-feet." 

   Some businessmen prefer animals. 
<LOCATION>Cal Worthington</LOCATION>, a <LOCATION>Sacramento</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, auto-dealer tycoon, has appeared in his commercials with pigs, tigers, hippos, elephants and, recently, an iguana. 
He introduces each as "my dog Spot." 
In <LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Joe Ricci</PERSON>, owner of a Jeep-Eagle dealership, also experimented with animals. 
Once, he posed with four horses to convey the message, "We don't horse around." 

   Someone should have shown the script to the horses. 
Three took off at a gallop down the median strip of <LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Mack Avenue</PERSON>, leaving <PERSON>Mr. Ricci</PERSON> behind, holding tight to the reigns of the fourth. 
A posse of Jeeps took off in pursuit. 
The horses' handler, a young woman, leapt onto <PERSON>Mr. Ricci</PERSON>'s horse and kicked away in a cloud of dust. 
She managed to stop the stampede. 

   The scary thing is, these commercials work. 
<PERSON>Shirley Tabb</PERSON>, one of 50 car salespeople at <ORGANIZATION>Koons Ford</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION>, makes her own commercials telling people to buy from her. 
She now sells an average of 35 cars a month, four times the national average for car salesmen. 
"Do you think it's going to take a miracle for you to buy your next new or used car, truck or van?" she asks, in her latest commercial. 
At the word "miracle" she sprouts wings, a halo and a wand. 
"Maybe, but not necessarily." 

   She made the angel commercial at a discount production studio in <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION> for <MONEY>$1,400</MONEY>. 
She spends <MONEY>$3,000</MONEY> a month for 50 spots on Channel 54, a local independent. 
It's money well spent. 
"I better not tell you how much I make," she says, laughing. 

   For viewers, commercials featuring businessmen seem to build a bond and enhance credibility. 
"There's a relationship," says <PERSON>Maurice J. Lezell</PERSON>, a <PERSON>Danny Thomas look-alike</PERSON>, and owner of <ORGANIZATION>Belvedere Construction Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION>Southfield</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mich</LOCATION>. 
Presenting himself as "Mister Belvedere," he has been starring in his own TV commercials since <DATE>1960</DATE>. 
"Most of the guys in my business, they hide behind three desks, they're so afraid," he says. 

   For the stars, the commercials bring fame. 
Locally, at least. 
Says <PERSON>Mel Farr</PERSON>: "People feel they know me. 
They see me in their living rooms, in their bedrooms, in their dens. 
When they see me on the street, they don't call me <PERSON>Mel Farr</PERSON> -- they call me <PERSON>Mel Farr</PERSON>, Superstar." 

   ---
   <PERSON>James McIngvale</PERSON> is bent over at the waist, like a man broken by a vicious cramp. 
He's counting his fingers, trying to figure out if the Fourth of <DATE>July</DATE> falls on a <DATE>Monday this year</DATE>. 
Satisfied that it does, he ad-libs a <DATE>July</DATE> Fourth sale. 
For three hours straight, he stands there in the lights against a radiant blue background, making up commercial after commercial, only once checking his cue card -- a furniture tag on which he has jotted some ideas. 

   "Look," he cries, "Look, up in the sky, in the sky! 
It's a bird, it's a plane -- no, it's your new recliner. . . ." 

   What his audience will see, instead of the blue background, is <PERSON>Mr. McIngvale</PERSON> standing before a recliner. 
One studio camera is focused on a manufacturer's photograph; another is aimed at <PERSON>Mr. McIngvale</PERSON>. 
Through an act of video wizardry, <PERSON>Mr. McIngvale</PERSON> will be superimposed over the photograph. 
Another 50 such photographs await their turn on the floor at the back of the studio, next to the rubber chicken. 

   <PERSON>Mr. McIngvale</PERSON> credits commercials like these with saving his company from an early death. 
He founded <ORGANIZATION>Gallery</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1981</DATE> in an abandoned model-home park on a freeway feeder. 
Back then, <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION>'s oil economy was booming. 
With so many families moving to town, <PERSON>Mr. McIngvale</PERSON> says, anyone could have sold furniture and done well. 
But <DATE>two years later</DATE>, the <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> economy went bust. 
Gallery had to start drawing established residents, or close. 
"I took the last <MONEY>$10,000</MONEY> I had and bet the company on television," <PERSON>Mr. McIngvale</PERSON> says. 

   His first commercial, in <DATE>February 1983</DATE>, didn't come easy. 
He spent an entire night struggling to make a single spot. 
In the middle of the last try, he realized he would come up five seconds short. 
Driven by sheer frustration, he tore some money from his pocket, leapt into the air and invented his now famous tagline. 

   Business picked up literally overnight. 
In <DATE>1982</DATE>, just before the great oil bust, <ORGANIZATION>Gallery</ORGANIZATION> had sales of <MONEY>$2 million</MONEY>. 
This year, <PERSON>Mr. McIngvale</PERSON> estimates, it will have <MONEY>$30 million</MONEY> in sales -- despite the still-languishing <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> economy. 
Now, moreover, he's a star. 
He gets asked to speak to schools and Rotary clubs; on weekends, fans come to the store just to get his autograph. 
But <PERSON>Mr. McIngvale</PERSON> insists, "I'm not a celebrity -- I'm just a guy who spends a lot of money to get on TV." 

   Nearby sits <PERSON>Sean O'Neel</PERSON>. 
He plays "Mr. 
Solid Wood" in <LOCATION>Gallery</LOCATION>'s radio commercials. (He is somewhat less solid these days, having lost nearly 200 pounds since having his stomach stapled last year; now he weighs a mere 280.) 
He leans over and whispers that when his daughter was two and a half, she began leaping up and down shouting "Saves . . . 
You . . . 
Money!" 
"If a child, a baby, can remember something," he says, "it's almost impossible for an adult to forget it." 

   <PERSON>Mr. O'Neel</PERSON>, wearing overalls and a flowered shirt, now puts on a baseball cap. 
He grabs the rubber chicken by the legs. 
The camera starts recording. 
Mimicking a back-country yokel, <PERSON>Mr. O'Neel</PERSON> confronts <PERSON>Mr. McIngvale</PERSON>. 
"I got mah eatin' chicken here," <PERSON>Mr. O'Neel</PERSON> shouts. 
"Ah need a table to eat mah chicken on. 
You got one?" 

   "Yes," says <PERSON>Mr. McIngvale</PERSON>. 
And his mouth is off and running: "You-need-a-solid-oak-table-and-chairs- to-eat-your-Sunday-afternoon-dinner-on- up-there-in-Waller?" 

   O'Neel: "That's what ah need." 

   McIngvale: "How-about-this-beautiful-dining-room- table-and-chairs?..." 

   ...
And at last, the great leap upward. 
"Gallery Furniture will Save . . . 
You . . . 
Mmmmmoney!" 

   Everyone relaxes. 
The cameraman leans out. 
"If I'd a known, I'd a brought you a real chicken," he says. 
"Have it flappin' through the whole spot. 
Now that'd be great."
