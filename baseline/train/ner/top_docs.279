   <ORGANIZATION>Royex Gold Mining Corp.</ORGANIZATION> said that its proposed merger with three affiliates and a large Royex holder would be implemented through an exchange of shares and that the new company will be called <ORGANIZATION>Corona Corp</ORGANIZATION>.

If approved at planned shareholder meetings in <DATE>June</DATE>, the resulting company would be one of <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION>'s largest and lowest-cost gold producers. 

   Under terms of the proposed merger, <ORGANIZATION>Royex</ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION>Corona Corp.</ORGANIZATION>'s share capital would consist mainly of Class A shares, with one vote each, and Class B shares, with 100 votes each. 
Royex Chairman <PERSON>Ned Goodman</PERSON> said certain Royex executives and directors would receive Class B shares with a combined voting stake of more than <PERCENT>50%</PERCENT> in <ORGANIZATION>Corona Corp</ORGANIZATION>. 

   Royex said the merger plan, approved by the directors of each company <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, provides that Royex holders would receive 0.61 Class A share of <ORGANIZATION>Corona Corp.</ORGANIZATION> for each <ORGANIZATION>Royex</ORGANIZATION> common share; <ORGANIZATION>International Corona</ORGANIZATION> holders would receive one <ORGANIZATION>Corona Corp</ORGANIZATION>. Class A share for each of their common shares; Lacana holders would receive 1.32 Class A shares of the new company for each Lacana share; and Mascot holders would receive 1.11 Class A shares for each <ORGANIZATION>Mascot</ORGANIZATION> share. 

   Galveston holders would receive 0.43 Class A share for each <LOCATION>Galveston</LOCATION> Class A share, and 0.43 Class B share in the new company for each <LOCATION>Galveston</LOCATION> Class B share. 

   The shares of the five companies are expected to resume trading today on the <ORGANIZATION>Toronto Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>. 
They were halted prior to the opening <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>. 

   Royex closed <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> at <MONEY>6.125 Canadian dollars</MONEY> (<MONEY>$4.94</MONEY>), Corona closed at <MONEY>9.75 dollars</MONEY>, Lacana at <MONEY>13.125 dollars</MONEY>, Mascot at <MONEY>11.25 dollars</MONEY>, and <LOCATION>Galveston</LOCATION>'s Class A and B shares each closed at <MONEY>4.60 dollars</MONEY>. 
The share values give the concerns a combined indicated market capitalization of about <MONEY>2.52 billion dollars</MONEY> (<MONEY>$2.03 billion</MONEY>). 

   The merger plan also specifies that all intercompany holdings between Royex, its affiliates and <LOCATION>Galveston</LOCATION> be canceled. 
Royex currently holds a <PERCENT>49%</PERCENT> stake in <LOCATION>Corona</LOCATION> and <PERCENT>45%</PERCENT> of Lacana, which in turn owns <PERCENT>50%</PERCENT> of Mascot. 
Corona and <LOCATION>Galveston</LOCATION> are <ORGANIZATION>Royex</ORGANIZATION>'s largest holders, with interests of about <PERCENT>41%</PERCENT> and <PERCENT>21%</PERCENT>, respectively. 
All companies are based in <LOCATION>Toronto</LOCATION> but <LOCATION>Galveston</LOCATION>, based in <LOCATION>Vancouver</LOCATION>. 

   Royex's <PERSON>Mr. Goodman</PERSON> will be chairman of the new concern, and <PERSON>Peter Steen</PERSON>, Royex president and chief executive officer, would retain his posts. 
<ORGANIZATION>Corona Corp.</ORGANIZATION> is expected to have <DATE>1988</DATE> gold output of about 465,000 ounces, annual cash flow of about <MONEY>200 million dollars</MONEY>, and interests in industrial minerals and oil and gas as well as gold. 
Four new gold mines are expected to be added by the end of <DATE>1989</DATE> to the five concerns' present eight mines. 

   Royex, <ORGANIZATION>International Corona</ORGANIZATION>, and <LOCATION>Galveston</LOCATION> would also issue warrants to purchase new <ORGANIZATION>Corona Corp.</ORGANIZATION> shares, and <ORGANIZATION>Royex</ORGANIZATION> said holders of its preferred shares and all warrants, options and convertible securities of the merging companies would be issued securities of <ORGANIZATION>Corona Corp.</ORGANIZATION> at the proposed merger ratios.

   <ORGANIZATION>Royex Gold Mining Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, three of its affiliates and <ORGANIZATION>Royex</ORGANIZATION>'s second-largest holder proposed a merger that would create one of <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION>'s biggest gold producers. 

   <PERSON>Peter Steen</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Royex</ORGANIZATION>'s president and chief executive officer, said directors of Royex, <ORGANIZATION>International Corona Resources Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Lacana Mining Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Mascot Gold Mines Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Galveston Resources Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> were to vote yesterday on the proposed merger. 
He said he expected the boards to approve the plan.

All the companies are based in <LOCATION>Toronto</LOCATION> except <LOCATION>Galveston</LOCATION>, which is based in <LOCATION>Vancouver</LOCATION>.

This would make the company the fifth-largest North American producer and one of the continent's lowest-cost gold mining concerns, according to <ORGANIZATION>Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. 

   Trading in the companies' shares was halted prior to the opening yesterday on the <ORGANIZATION>Toronto Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>.

   Based on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>'s share values, the concerns have a combined indicated market capitalization of about <MONEY>2.52 billion dollars</MONEY> (<MONEY>$2.03 billion</MONEY>). 

   <PERSON>Mr. Steen</PERSON> said his gold production estimates for the proposed company include output from the disputed Page-Williams mine, ownership of which is being contested by <ORGANIZATION>LAC Minerals Ltd</ORGANIZATION>. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court of Canada</ORGANIZATION> is expected to end the lengthy legal battle after it hears an appeal by LAC, scheduled for <DATE>October</DATE>. 
An <LOCATION>Ontario</LOCATION> court previously awarded the mine to Corona.

Feisty Pezim Only Wants a Gold Mine
-- And International Corona's Top Job
--
By Leonard Zehr and Alan Bayless
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL>
<DD> 03/03/87</DD>
<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO>
<IN> T.ICR </IN>
<TEXT>
   Canadian mining promotor <PERSON>Murray Pezim</PERSON> has begun a messy corporate fight to get his gold mine back. 

   Last week, <ORGANIZATION>International Corona Resources Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> said it would discontinue the positions of vice chairmen, held by the "Pez," as he is called, and <PERSON>Ned Goodman</PERSON>. 
The <LOCATION>Toronto</LOCATION> gold-mining company said the two could remain as directors. 
In addition, two of <PERSON>Mr. Pezim</PERSON>'s nominees to the 10-member board failed to win reelection. 

   Next <DATE>Monday</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court of Ontario</ORGANIZATION> will hear <PERSON>Mr. Pezim</PERSON>'s request to have five Corona directors removed and replaced with his nominees or with court-appointees. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Pezim</PERSON>, who helped found the company, vowed to press his feud against management, saying the board broke an agreement under which he was to have continued to serve in an "executive position." 

   "Even if we don't win <DATE>Monday</DATE>, I'm going to call a special shareholders meeting and vote <PERCENT>51%</PERCENT> of the stock for a new board," <PERSON>Mr. Pezim</PERSON> said. 
"My people are buying a lot of (<ORGANIZATION>Corona</ORGANIZATION>) stock. 
I want to be chairman again." 
<PERSON>Mr. Pezim</PERSON> became vice chairman several years ago when he gave up the post as chairman because of illness. 

   In the early <DATE>1980s</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Corona</ORGANIZATION> was a fledgling mining exploration company that was effectively controlled by <PERSON>Mr. Pezim</PERSON>. 
Under his leadership, the company discovered <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>'s richest gold deposit at <ORGANIZATION>Hemlo</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Ontario</LOCATION>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Pezim</PERSON> arranged the initial financing that led to the discovery of the <ORGANIZATION>Hemlo</ORGANIZATION> ore body. 

   Officials of Corona couldn't be reached for comment on the issue of dropping <PERSON>Mr. Pezim</PERSON> as vice chairman, but in a previous statement, the company said it was "disturbed about statements purportedly made to the media by <PERSON>Mr. Pezim</PERSON> concerning proposed transactions that have not been recommended by <ORGANIZATION>Corona</ORGANIZATION>'s management, nor considered by the Corona board." 

   His fight began six weeks ago when <PERSON>Mr. Pezim</PERSON> asked <PERSON>Peter Steen</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Corona</ORGANIZATION>'s chief executive officer, for 40 Corona annual reports to give to his clients in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Steen</PERSON> refused. 
"<PERSON>Steen</PERSON> told me they don't want me representing the company," <PERSON>Mr. Pezim</PERSON> recalled. 

   A <ORGANIZATION>Corona</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman said that <PERSON>Mr. Steen</PERSON> and <PERSON>Theodore Rhenius</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Corona</ORGANIZATION>'s chief financial officer, were in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> <DATE>last September</DATE> speaking to potential investors. 
"<PERSON>Peter</PERSON> felt things might get confused having two groups speaking for the company," she added. 
<PERSON>Mr. Steen</PERSON> couldn't be reached for comment. 

   "I've had indications for the past year that (<ORGANIZATION>Corona</ORGANIZATION> and its largest single shareholder, <ORGANIZATION>Royex Gold Mining Corp.</ORGANIZATION>) have wanted to get rid of me," <PERSON>Mr. Pezim</PERSON> said. 
"They totally shafted us at the Corona annual meeting, when they proposed a new board. 
We didn't have the faintest idea that two of my people weren't going to be reappointed." 

   The Corona spokeswoman says <PERSON>Mr. Pezim</PERSON> "started making noises" in <DATE>January</DATE> about gaining control of Corona. 
She said Royex, which owns <PERCENT>38%</PERCENT> of Corona, supported the new slate of directors "to lessen <PERSON>Mr. Pezim</PERSON>'s influence on the board." 
Corona owns about <PERCENT>50%</PERCENT> of Royex. 

   One of <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>'s most colorful executives, the 66-year-old <PERSON>Mr. Pezim</PERSON> currently promotes a stable of about 40 Vancouver Stock Exchange-listed mining companies. 
<PERSON>Mr. Pezim</PERSON> claims he made and lost a total of more than <MONEY>$150 million</MONEY> (Canadian) from various ventures. 

   He said he lost control of Corona in <DATE>1984</DATE> after two ill-fated ventures -- Pezzaz greeting cards, which featured audiocassette messages from Hollywood personalities, and <ORGANIZATION>Swensen's Ice Cream Co.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>. 
"Every time I get involved in something other than gold mining, I get burned," he said. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Goodman</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Royex</ORGANIZATION>'s current chairman, bailed out Corona and <PERSON>Mr. Pezim</PERSON>, who owed his stockbrokers about <MONEY>$4 million</MONEY> in <DATE>1984</DATE>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Pezim</PERSON> estimated his stake to have been about <PERCENT>25%</PERCENT>, a portion of which he sold to <PERSON>Mr. Goodman</PERSON>. 

   According to <PERSON>Mr. Pezim</PERSON>, the two had a verbal agreement to retain <PERSON>Mr. Pezim</PERSON> as a senior officer of Corona and a member of the executive committee. 
He also said they agreed that the <PERSON>Goodman</PERSON> and <PERSON>Pezim</PERSON> groups would have equal representation on the Corona board. 

   Now, <PERSON>Mr. Pezim</PERSON> thinks <PERSON>Mr. Goodman</PERSON> is behind the moves to push him out of Corona. 
<PERSON>Mr. Goodman</PERSON> "is my sworn enemy now. 
I'm going to dig up everything I can on him. 
I'm a street fighter. 
I don't quit once I start something." 
<PERSON>Mr. Goodman</PERSON> wasn't available for comment. 

   In addition to owning a <PERCENT>50%</PERCENT> interest in one of the three gold mines at <ORGANIZATION>Hemlo</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Corona</PERSON> won a court decision last year against <ORGANIZATION>LAC Minerals Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, which also operates a mine at <ORGANIZATION>Hemlo</ORGANIZATION>. 
The court ordered LAC to hand over its mine, valued by some specialists at more than <MONEY>$1 billion</MONEY>, to Corona. 
An appeals court is expected to rule soon. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Pezim</PERSON>, who launched the suit against LAC, said he wants to have more influence at Corona. 
He also said he disagreed with many of Corona's recent decisions, including a <MONEY>$45 million</MONEY> warrant financing last year. 

   Moreover, he says he wasn't consulted when Royex paid about <MONEY>$52 million</MONEY> earlier this year to acquire effective control of <ORGANIZATION>Lacana Mining Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Toronto</LOCATION> mining and oil and gas concern. 
While he isn't a director of Royex, he said Royex probably plans to use proceeds to buy more Corona shares to tighten the interlocking ownership among the three companies.

   <ORGANIZATION>Galveston Resources Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, a gold exploration concern, plans a <MONEY>$40 million</MONEY> (Canadian) bond offering and a <MONEY>$20 million</MONEY> equity offering, <PERSON>Murray Pezim</PERSON>, chairman, said. 

   Proceeds will be used for general purposes, "possibly including the purchase of securities of certain gold mining companies," <PERSON>Mr. Pezim</PERSON> said. 

   He declined to say if he would use the funds to purchase stock of <ORGANIZATION>International Corona Resources Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, a Toronto-based gold mining concern. 
As previously reported, <PERSON>Mr. Pezim</PERSON> is seeking to replace <ORGANIZATION>Corona</ORGANIZATION>'s board. 

   Interest on the bonds will be paid semi-annually in shares of Corona from <LOCATION>Galveston</LOCATION>'s holdings of the stock, <PERSON>Mr. Pezim</PERSON> said. 
Based on a price of <MONEY>$40</MONEY> a Corona share, the interest payment would be <PERCENT>10%</PERCENT>, he said. 
On the <ORGANIZATION>Toronto Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>, Corona closed yesterday at <MONEY>$41</MONEY>, down <MONEY>75 cents</MONEY>. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Pezim</PERSON> said the payout of Corona shares wouldn't hurt his corporate fight because he expects the battle to be completed within six months. 
He declined to disclose the number of Corona shares held by <LOCATION>Galveston</LOCATION>, but said it was sufficient to cover the interest payments. 

   The <LOCATION>Galveston</LOCATION> bonds will have a three-year maturity and will be convertible into <LOCATION>Galveston</LOCATION> common shares at <MONEY>$40</MONEY> a share, the company said. 
The offer is subject to regulatory approval.

   TORONTO -- "We've never had any cash," says Corona Corp.'s
Ned Goodman. "When you get into a situation where your
opposition is dealing with cash, you've got to become more
creative."
   Creative financing is the Corona chairman's hallmark.
Mainly by issuing new securities and trading them for assets,
he has built Toronto-based Corona into one of North America's
10 biggest gold mining companies. Through a special class of
shares, he and a few friends have solid control with only
7.6% of the equity. His penchant for complex deals and
ultimate control has given rise to what analysts call the
"Ned Factor," a sort of bewilderment discount that they say
sometimes affects the share prices of his companies.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Despite this, Corona shareholders have done better over
the years than those of most other Canadian gold companies.
   Now <PERSON>Mr. Goodman</PERSON>, 52 years old, has proposed a typically
complex series of transactions, entirely paid for with paper,
that could win Corona control of two companies that own
<LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>'s hottest new gold property. The <LOCATION>Eskay Creek</LOCATION> property
in <LOCATION>British Columbia</LOCATION> has estimated reserves of 4.8 million
ounces, worth about <MONEY>US$1.66 billion</MONEY> at current prices.
   But Corona, and <PERSON>Mr. Goodman</PERSON>'s paper-shuffling style, are
challenged by a <MONEY>230 million Canadian dollar</MONEY> (<MONEY>US$196 million</MONEY>),
all-cash offer by <ORGANIZATION>Placer Dome Inc.</ORGANIZATION> for one of the target
companies, <ORGANIZATION>Stikine Resources Ltd</ORGANIZATION>. Most analysts agree that
<PERSON>Mr. Goodman</PERSON>'s paper probably has more long-term value than
<ORGANIZATION>Placer Dome</ORGANIZATION>'s cash, and <ORGANIZATION>Corona</ORGANIZATION> also has locked up a huge
block of shares in <ORGANIZATION>Stikine</ORGANIZATION>. But recent declines in the price
of gold, along with the Ned Factor, have pushed down the
price of <ORGANIZATION>Corona</ORGANIZATION>'s shares and, therefore, the value of its
planned offer. The contest won't be over until <LOCATION>Vancouver</LOCATION>,
<ORGANIZATION>British Columbia-based Placer Dome</ORGANIZATION>'s bid expires today.
   <PERSON>Mr. Goodman</PERSON>'s style has deep roots. Born in <LOCATION>Montreal</LOCATION>, he
was trained as a geologist and later moved into investment
counseling. He became involved with a sleepy copper producer
called <ORGANIZATION>Campbell Chibougamau Mines Ltd</ORGANIZATION>. After a <DATE>1979</DATE> proxy
fight, <PERSON>Mr. Goodman</PERSON> took over as chairman and went on a
shopping binge in the resource sector.
   By <DATE>1985</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Campbell</ORGANIZATION> had run up lots of debt, and <PERSON>Mr. Goodman</PERSON>
was outnumbered when the board decided to sell the company's
interest in <ORGANIZATION>Royex Gold Mining Corp</ORGANIZATION>. He quit the <ORGANIZATION>Campbell</ORGANIZATION>
board and bought the Royex stake in a transaction that even
<PERSON>Mr. Goodman</PERSON> says was complex.
   "I said that I'd never put myself in a position again of
working for a company where someone else is going to make the
decisions," <PERSON>Mr. Goodman</PERSON> says.
   Royex's main asset was its holding in <ORGANIZATION>International Corona
Resources Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, which in turn held a controlling stake in
Royex. Over the next three years, Royex acquired major
interests in other resource outfits, financing the deals in
part by transferring investments between units.
   "We were getting an awful lot of criticism because we had
a complicated company. I didn't like it either. (But) we had
no choice," <PERSON>Mr. Goodman</PERSON> says. To simplify matters, he merged
Royex with four related companies to form Corona in <DATE>1988</DATE>.
   In his latest proposal, <PERSON>Mr. Goodman</PERSON> plans to spin off
Corona's gold assets into a separately listed company. Some
shares of the new company, to be called <ORGANIZATION>Corona Gold Corp.</ORGANIZATION>,
will be distributed to current Corona holders. He also has
offered a combination of Corona and <ORGANIZATION>Corona Gold</ORGANIZATION> shares to the
owners of <LOCATION>Eskay Creek</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Stikine</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Prime Resources Group
Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, which would then be merged with <ORGANIZATION>Corona Gold</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>Mr. Goodman</PERSON> says the Corona restructuring, which would
leave the parent holding a mixed basket of resource
interests, is meant to still the "moans and groans" of
holders who disapproved of the company's branching out from
precious metals.
   But the restructuring plan hasn't satisfied all of <PERSON>Mr.
Goodman</PERSON>'s critics, who complain that he freely spends
<ORGANIZATION>Corona</ORGANIZATION>'s Class A shares, which carry one vote apiece, while
leaving intact the number of Class B shares, which have 100
votes apiece and are largely held by <PERSON>Mr. Goodman</PERSON> and four
other directors.
   A study of <ORGANIZATION>Corona</ORGANIZATION>'s past share price performance indicates
that backing <PERSON>Mr. Goodman</PERSON> has been wise. <PERSON>Barry Allan</PERSON>, an
analyst at <ORGANIZATION>Prudential-Bache Securities Canada Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>,
calculates that an investor buying a Royex share in <DATE>January
1987</DATE>, when <PERSON>Mr. Goodman</PERSON> became <ORGANIZATION>Royex</ORGANIZATION>'s chairman, would have
seen a <PERCENT>3.4%</PERCENT> appreciation in his money. This compares with a
<PERCENT>9.9%</PERCENT> drop in the <ORGANIZATION>Toronto Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> gold index over the
same period and a decline of <PERCENT>15%</PERCENT> in the price of gold
bullion.
   Nevertheless, "there are a lot of people who don't want to
have anything to do with the guy (<PERSON>Mr. Goodman</PERSON>). I sometimes
wonder whether people are afraid of him because he's two
steps ahead of them," says <PERSON>John Embry</PERSON>, a vice president of
Toronto-based <ORGANIZATION>Royal Bank Investment Management</ORGANIZATION>, which holds
about <PERCENT>4%</PERCENT> of the Corona Class A shares.
   Although he backs <PERSON>Mr. Goodman</PERSON>'s proposals to acquire <LOCATION>Eskay
Creek</LOCATION> and restructure Corona, <PERSON>Mr. Embry</PERSON> says he remains
concerned <ORGANIZATION>Corona</ORGANIZATION> will continue to control the new gold unit
with a <PERCENT>50.2%</PERCENT> holding.
   <PERSON>Mr. Goodman</PERSON> plans to remain at the helm of the Corona
parent, which will concentrate on building up its interests
in base metals, oil and gas, industrial minerals and
financial services. Meantime, <ORGANIZATION>Corona Gold</ORGANIZATION>, if it succeeds in
its plan to merge with the current owners of <LOCATION>Eskay Creek</LOCATION>,
will focus on developing that ore body. <PERSON>Mr. Goodman</PERSON> estimates
the addition of <LOCATION>Eskay Creek</LOCATION> would boost <ORGANIZATION>Corona</ORGANIZATION>'s production
to about 1.2 million ounces of gold in <DATE>1994</DATE> from 700,000
ounces expected this year.

   A gold mine developed by <ORGANIZATION>LAC Minerals Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> that is expected to become <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>'s biggest producer belongs to <ORGANIZATION>International Corona Resources Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, an <ORGANIZATION>Ontario Court of Appeal</ORGANIZATION> ruled. 

   In a long-awaited decision, a panel of four judges unanimously upheld a <DATE>1986</DATE> ruling by the <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court of Ontario</ORGANIZATION> and dismissed LAC's appeal to overturn it. 
LAC declined to say whether it would seek a further appeal. 

   <PERSON>Peter Steen</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>International Corona</ORGANIZATION>'s chairman, president and chief executive officer, said "Naturally, we're delighted. 
We feel that justice has been done." 
As a result of the added production from the disputed mine, <ORGANIZATION>International Corona</ORGANIZATION> expects to more than double its gold output this year and <ORGANIZATION>Royex Gold Mining Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, which holds a <PERCENT>49%</PERCENT> interest in <LOCATION>International Corona</LOCATION>, expects its gold output to increase about <PERCENT>40%</PERCENT>. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Steen</PERSON> said he will soon meet with Vancouver-based <ORGANIZATION>Teck Corp.</ORGANIZATION> to discuss their plans to jointly operate the mine and one next to it at <LOCATION>Ontario</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Hemlo</ORGANIZATION> gold district. 
Together, the two mines are expected to produce about 700,000 ounces of gold annually by <DATE>1990</DATE>. 

   <PERSON>David Thompson</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Teck</ORGANIZATION>'s vice president, finance, said <ORGANIZATION>Teck</ORGANIZATION> is "very pleased." 
<ORGANIZATION>Teck</ORGANIZATION> acquired half of Page-Williams in <DATE>1986</DATE> and its share of the mine output is expected to double <ORGANIZATION>Teck</ORGANIZATION>'s gold production this year. 

   LAC must hand over the mine once <ORGANIZATION>International Corona</ORGANIZATION> pays it <MONEY>154 million Canadian dollars</MONEY> (<MONEY>$117.8 million</MONEY>) to help cover the mine's development costs, unless LAC can obtain a court order deferring the transfer. 
An <ORGANIZATION>International Corona</ORGANIZATION> lawyer said he expected <ORGANIZATION>International Corona</ORGANIZATION> to pay LAC the funds this week. 

   In return, LAC must pay <ORGANIZATION>International Corona</ORGANIZATION> an amount equal to the mine's earnings since it opened in <DATE>January 1986</DATE>. 
The mine, which was expected to provide about <PERCENT>40%</PERCENT> of LAC's gold production in <DATE>1987</DATE>, earned about <MONEY>24.3 million dollars</MONEY> <DATE>during the 18 months ended June 30</DATE>. 

   In their 126-page ruling, delayed because of the death in <DATE>June</DATE> of one of their members, the appeal court judges said they found "ample evidence" to support the conclusions of <ORGANIZATION>Ontario Supreme Court Justice</ORGANIZATION> <PERSON>R.E. Holland</PERSON>, who heard the original court trial. 

   The appeal court upheld the conclusions of <ORGANIZATION>Justice Holland</ORGANIZATION>. 
It cited LAC for breaching a trust with <ORGANIZATION>International Corona</ORGANIZATION> when the two talked about a joint venture in <DATE>1981</DATE>. 
The panel agreed LAC used confidential information given to it by <ORGANIZATION>International Corona</ORGANIZATION>, then a tiny exploration company, to acquire the property where the PageWilliams mine now operates. 

   Analysts say they expect the ruling to have a positive effect on <ORGANIZATION>International Corona</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Royex</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Teck</ORGANIZATION> share prices. 

   <PERSON>Paul Esquivel</PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION>Davidson Partners Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Toronto</LOCATION>, said he believes <ORGANIZATION>Corona</ORGANIZATION>'s shares are valued at about <MONEY>60 dollars</MONEY> if one includes the Page-Williams mine. 

   In trading <DATE>Friday</DATE> on the <ORGANIZATION>Toronto Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>International Corona</ORGANIZATION> closed at <MONEY>47.50 dollars</MONEY>, up <MONEY>25 cents</MONEY>. 
Royex shares closed at <MONEY>5.50 dollars</MONEY>, up <MONEY>12.5 cents</MONEY>; <ORGANIZATION>Teck</ORGANIZATION> closed at <MONEY>33.75 dollars</MONEY>, down <MONEY>25 cents</MONEY>. 

   <PERSON>Amy Gassman</PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION>Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, said she expects a "moderately negative" short-term impact on <ORGANIZATION>LAC</ORGANIZATION>'s share price.

   <ORGANIZATION>Royex Gold Mining Corp.</ORGANIZATION> said it is offering a package of securities and cash with an indicated value of about <MONEY>$234.4 million</MONEY> (Canadian) under its previously reported plan to raise its stake in <ORGANIZATION>International Corona Resources Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, a gold mining affiliate based here. 

   Under the offer, mailed yesterday to shareholders of <LOCATION>International Corona</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Royex</PERSON> said it is offering to purchase four million <ORGANIZATION>International Corona</ORGANIZATION> common shares for <MONEY>$4</MONEY> each in cash and <MONEY>$47.50</MONEY> of new Royex preference shares and warrants. 
Royex currently holds about 8.2 million, or <PERCENT>38%</PERCENT> of <ORGANIZATION>International Corona</ORGANIZATION>'s 21.6 million issued common shares. 

   Royex said it is also offering one Royex preference share and one Royex warrant, with a combined indicated value of <MONEY>$42.50</MONEY>, for each of 711,053 International Corona warrants that expire <DATE>Aug. 31</DATE>. 

   Royex said the offer, if successful, would effectively raise its interest in <LOCATION>International Corona</LOCATION> to <PERCENT>58%</PERCENT> from <PERCENT>38%</PERCENT> on an undiluted basis, or to <PERCENT>44%</PERCENT> from <PERCENT>24%</PERCENT> on a fully diluted basis. 
Royex said its voting interest in <LOCATION>International Corona</LOCATION> would be raised to <PERCENT>50%</PERCENT>. 

   Under the offer, which is scheduled to expire <DATE>April 22</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Royex</ORGANIZATION> said its two new series of Royex preference shares will initially be convertible into 3.33 Royex common shares, subject to a one-time adjustment to reflect the outcome of litigation between <ORGANIZATION>International Corona</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Lac Minerals Ltd</ORGANIZATION>. 
The adjustment will be made after the litigation is resolved, or not later than <DATE>April 30, 1990</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Royex</ORGANIZATION> said. 

   The litigation relates to a dispute between <ORGANIZATION>International Corona</ORGANIZATION> and Lac over a large northern <LOCATION>Ontario</LOCATION> gold mine. 

   Royex said its offer for <ORGANIZATION>International Corona</ORGANIZATION> common shares isn't conditional on any minimum acceptance level, but if fewer than 2.7 million <ORGANIZATION>International Corona</ORGANIZATION> common are deposited, <ORGANIZATION>International Corona</ORGANIZATION>'s share and warrant holders will be entitled to withdraw from the offer within two days after its expiration. 
If more than four million <ORGANIZATION>International Corona</ORGANIZATION> shares are tendered, <ORGANIZATION>Royex</ORGANIZATION> said it will pay for the shares on a pro-rata basis. 

   Trading in <ORGANIZATION>International Corona</ORGANIZATION> and Royex shares was halted yesterday on the <ORGANIZATION>Toronto Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>. 
In trading <DATE>Monday</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Corona</ORGANIZATION> closed at <MONEY>$43.125</MONEY>, up <MONEY>62.5 cents</MONEY>, and Royex common closed at <MONEY>$6.125</MONEY>, down <MONEY>25 cents</MONEY>.

   The <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court of Canada</ORGANIZATION> agreed to let <ORGANIZATION>LAC Minerals Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> appeal a decision that would have forced it to hand over a big <LOCATION>Ontario</LOCATION> gold mine to <ORGANIZATION>International Corona Resources Ltd</ORGANIZATION>. 

   The court didn't offer its reasons for the decision. 
A <ORGANIZATION>LAC</ORGANIZATION> spokesman said the appeal might not be heard until <DATE>1989</DATE>. 

   Corona's president and chief executive officer, <PERSON>Peter Steen</PERSON>, said he was "disappointed" by the ruling. 
It followed a decision in <DATE>October</DATE> by an <ORGANIZATION>Ontario Court of Appeal</ORGANIZATION> to award the Page-Williams mine, in <LOCATION>Ontario</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Hemlo</ORGANIZATION> district, to <LOCATION>Corona</LOCATION>, upholding a <DATE>1986</DATE> court ruling. 
The appeals court agreed that LAC used confidential information given to it by Corona to acquire the property where the Page-Williams mine now operates. 

   Corona said it plans a cross-appeal to the <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court of Canada</ORGANIZATION> regarding the company's claim that it shouldn't have to pay <MONEY>LAC 154 million Canadian dollars</MONEY> (<MONEY>$117.8 million</MONEY>) to help compensate it for developing the Page-Williams property. 

   The outcome of the legal battle will significantly affect both Toronto-based companies and their affiliates. 
Page-Williams is expected to become <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>'s biggest gold mine. 
It would have accounted for more than half of <ORGANIZATION>Corona</ORGANIZATION>'s gold output and about <PERCENT>40%</PERCENT> of LAC's gold output this year.

   Poco is a fast-growing oil and gas producer. 
Toronto-based Corona, formed last week through the merger of five affiliated mining concerns, is among <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION>'s top five gold producers. 

   Under the proposed transaction's terms, the companies said <ORGANIZATION>Central</ORGANIZATION> will acquire <ORGANIZATION>Corona</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Lacana Petroleum</ORGANIZATION> unit's oil and gas assets, which are mainly in <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>. 
They include about 6.4 million barrels of oil reserves, 56.8 billion cubic feet of natural gas reserves, 78,000 acres of undeveloped land and related working capital of more than <MONEY>C$20 million</MONEY>. 

   Central will incur a debt to Poco for the assets and <ORGANIZATION>Poco</ORGANIZATION> will issue to Corona five million new common shares and two million new preferred shares that would be convertible to an equal number of <ORGANIZATION>Poco</ORGANIZATION> common shares. 

   In <ORGANIZATION>Toronto Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading yesterday, Poco's common shares closed at <MONEY>$10.375</MONEY>, up <MONEY>37.5 cents</MONEY>. 
The company currently has about 20.5 million common shares outstanding. 

   Corona, which will have three nominees on <ORGANIZATION>Poco</ORGANIZATION>'s board, said it currently doesn't plan to raise its stake in <LOCATION>Poco</LOCATION>. 
A Corona official said the Poco investment would assign a market value to <ORGANIZATION>Corona</ORGANIZATION>'s oil and gas assets, which the company believed weren't recognized previously by investors.

   <PERSON>Peter Steen</PERSON>, president and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION>Corona Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, said the company remains "receptive to examining an out-of-court settlement" with <ORGANIZATION>LAC Minerals Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> regarding the disputed <ORGANIZATION>Williams</ORGANIZATION> mine at <ORGANIZATION>Hemlo</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Ontario</LOCATION>. 

   Still, the sides haven't discussed the issue since a meeting earlier this year, he said. 

   "That's the only meeting that I have had, and that's the only meeting that <PERSON>Corona</PERSON> has had" with LAC, <PERSON>Mr. Steen</PERSON> said in an interview. 
Asked if Corona is willing to reopen talks, he said: "I think we're waiting for {LAC's president and chief executive, <PERSON>Peter Allen</PERSON>} to make his move." 

   A <ORGANIZATION>LAC</ORGANIZATION> spokesman said "nothing substantial was discussed" at the <DATE>spring</DATE> meeting, and that LAC doesn't plan to resume talks. 

   <ORGANIZATION>International Corona Resources Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, one of five affiliated companies that agreed earlier this month to merge to form <ORGANIZATION>Corona Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, was awarded ownership of the <ORGANIZATION>Williams</ORGANIZATION> mine in <DATE>1986</DATE> by the <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court of Ontario</ORGANIZATION>. 
The decision was upheld on appeal and the <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court of Canada</ORGANIZATION> will hear a final appeal <DATE>Oct. 11</DATE>. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Steen</PERSON> said Corona, whose merger takes effect <DATE>Friday</DATE>, doesn't believe its case will be affected by other litigation in progress involving the <ORGANIZATION>Hemlo</ORGANIZATION> claims. 

   Neither <PERSON>Mr. Steen</PERSON> nor Corona Vice President and Treasurer <PERSON>Tony Walsh</PERSON> would offer specific earnings or revenue projections. 
Nevertheless, <PERSON>Mr. Walsh</PERSON> described as "reasonable" an analyst's forecast that <ORGANIZATION>Corona</ORGANIZATION> will earn about <MONEY>77 million Canadian dollars</MONEY> (<MONEY>US$63.8 million</MONEY>), or <MONEY>53 cents</MONEY> a share, on revenue of <MONEY>C$264 million</MONEY> for the fiscal year ending <DATE>Sept. 30</DATE>, and <MONEY>C$111 million</MONEY>, or <MONEY>75 cents</MONEY> a share, on revenue of <MONEY>C$376 million</MONEY> for fiscal <DATE>1989</DATE>. 

   The forecast is based on gold output of 466,000 ounces this year and 630,000 ounces for fiscal <DATE>1989</DATE> and an average gold price of <MONEY>$450</MONEY> an ounce. 
Corona previously forecast output of 465,000 ounces for <DATE>1988</DATE> and 650,000 ounces for <DATE>1989</DATE> at an average cash production cost of <MONEY>$170</MONEY> an ounce. 

   <PERSON>Igor Levental</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Corona</ORGANIZATION>'s newly appointed director, acquisitions and evaluations, said <PERSON>Corona</PERSON> "could take on a <MONEY>C$400</MONEY>-<MONEY>$500 million</MONEY> company" with its current financial resources. 
<PERSON>Mr. Steen</PERSON> said the company is considering an offer for Toronto-based <ORGANIZATION>Franco-Nevada Mining Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, in which <ORGANIZATION>Corona</ORGANIZATION> holds a <PERCENT>15%</PERCENT> stake. 
"It's on the market, and we are taking a look at it," he said.

   The <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court of Canada</ORGANIZATION> awarded the country's richest gold mine to <ORGANIZATION>Corona Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, ending an acrimonious eight-year legal battle between <PERSON>Corona</PERSON> and the mine's developer, <ORGANIZATION>LAC Minerals Ltd</ORGANIZATION>. 

   The court ruled that Toronto-based LAC must hand over the Page-Williams mine in northern <LOCATION>Ontario</LOCATION> and that Corona must pay <MONEY>LAC 154 million Canadian dollars</MONEY> (<MONEY>US$131.6 million</MONEY>) for past development costs. 
With interest, the payment would amount to more than <MONEY>C$210 million</MONEY>. 

   Corona, also based in <LOCATION>Toronto</LOCATION>, said the payment is to come equally from it and from <ORGANIZATION>Teck Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Vancouver</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>British Columbia</LOCATION>, which plans to operate the mine in an equal partnership with Corona. 
The two companies also will split about <MONEY>C$80 million</MONEY> in profit from the mine that has been held in a trust account since <DATE>1986</DATE>. 

   The ruling upholds the findings of the <ORGANIZATION>Ontario Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1986</DATE> and the <ORGANIZATION>Ontario Court of Appeals</ORGANIZATION> <DATE>a year later</DATE>, saying that <ORGANIZATION>LAC</ORGANIZATION> had "breached a duty of confidence" with <ORGANIZATION>Corona</ORGANIZATION>'s predecessor company when it talked with <ORGANIZATION>LAC</ORGANIZATION> about a possible joint venture in <DATE>1981</DATE>. 
The high court said LAC used confidential information given to it by <ORGANIZATION>Corona</ORGANIZATION>'s predecessor to acquire the property where the Page-Williams mine operates. 

   The Page-Williams mine, which last year produced 379,000 ounces of gold, should produce 490,000 ounces this year, said <PERSON>Peter Steen</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Corona</ORGANIZATION>'s president and chief executive officer. 
He said <ORGANIZATION>Corona</ORGANIZATION>'s half-share of the output would boost the company's production this year by <PERCENT>64%</PERCENT> to an expected 625,000 ounces, advancing the company's transformation from a small exploration outfit in the early <DATE>1980s</DATE> to one of <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>'s top gold producers. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Steen</PERSON> said the companies plan to accelerate the exploration of little-known areas of the mine. 
The reserves already discovered contain nearly seven million ounces of gold, he said. 
<ORGANIZATION>Teck</ORGANIZATION> said its operations, without Page-Williams, are expected to produce about 150,000 ounces of gold this year. 

   LAC's chief financial officer, <PERSON>Rolly Francisco</PERSON>, said he was disappointed with the court's ruling but said LAC will abide by the decision and work closely with <ORGANIZATION>Corona</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Teck</ORGANIZATION> to ensure an orderly handover of the mine. 
LAC hasn't included earnings from the Page-Williams mine in its own accounts since <DATE>1986</DATE>. 

   LAC's defeat in court could leave the company vulnerable to a takeover attempt, analysts said. 

   With the company currently holding cash of about <MONEY>C$250 million</MONEY> plus the payment due for the Page-Williams mine, "I think it becomes a real attractive takeover candidate if the share price dropped. 
You would be able to finance much of the takeover cost with the company's own cash," said <PERSON>Julian Baldry</PERSON>, a senior mining analyst at <ORGANIZATION>Nesbitt Thomson Deacon Inc</ORGANIZATION>. 

   Before the court decision was announced, LAC shares closed <DATE>Friday</DATE> in <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading at <MONEY>$11.375</MONEY> each, down <MONEY>12.5 cents</MONEY>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Baldry</PERSON> estimated the company could become vulnerable to takeover if its stock falls below <MONEY>C$10</MONEY> (<MONEY>$8.54</MONEY>) a share. 

   In composite trading on the <ORGANIZATION>American Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>, Corona Class A shares closed at <MONEY>$7.375</MONEY> each, down <MONEY>50 cents</MONEY>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Teck</ORGANIZATION> Class B shares closed at <MONEY>C$22.625</MONEY>, down <MONEY>C$1.375</MONEY>, on the <ORGANIZATION>Toronto Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>.

   <ORGANIZATION>Giant Yellowknife Mines Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> said it offered to buy <PERCENT>19.99%</PERCENT> of <ORGANIZATION>Dome Mines Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> for <MONEY>417.1 million Canadian dollars</MONEY> (<MONEY>$313.1 million</MONEY>). 

   The transaction could thwart <ORGANIZATION>Dome Mines</ORGANIZATION>' plan to form <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION>'s biggest gold mining company through a merger with two other concerns. 

   Giant <PERSON>Yellowknife</PERSON> said it offered <MONEY>21.50 dollars</MONEY> a share to <ORGANIZATION>Dome Petroleum Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> for about 19.4 million of the 20.9 million <ORGANIZATION>Dome Mines</ORGANIZATION> shares that the oil and gas company owns. 
If the sale goes through, <ORGANIZATION>Giant Yellowknife</ORGANIZATION> said it would vote the shares against a proposal to combine <ORGANIZATION>Dome Mines</ORGANIZATION> with <ORGANIZATION>Campbell Red Lake Mines Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Placer Development Ltd</ORGANIZATION>. 

   Shareholders of the three companies are to vote on the merger proposal <DATE>Aug. 12</DATE>. 
In trading <DATE>Friday</DATE> on the <ORGANIZATION>Toronto Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Dome Mines</ORGANIZATION> closed at <MONEY>21 dollars</MONEY>, up one dollar. 

   <PERSON>David Emery</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Giant Yellowknife</ORGANIZATION>, declined to say why his company would oppose the merger. 
But a <ORGANIZATION>Giant Yellowknife</ORGANIZATION> insider said the company prefers a major stake in <ORGANIZATION>Dome Mines</ORGANIZATION> to a smaller one in the combined company, since the two concerns could benefit from "synergies" in their gold mining operations. 
The companies operate several gold mines and mills near <LOCATION>Timmins</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ontario</LOCATION>. 

   The insider said <ORGANIZATION>Giant Yellowknife</ORGANIZATION> is also interested in <ORGANIZATION>Dome Mines</ORGANIZATION>' <PERCENT>21.4%</PERCENT> stake in Toronto-based <ORGANIZATION>Falconbridge Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, which has zinc, copper and gold mines in the area. 
Giant <LOCATION>Yellowknife</LOCATION> is a gold producer, but it is indirectly controlled by <ORGANIZATION>Ariadne Australia Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>, which has interests in other metals. 

   Giant <PERSON>Yellowknife</PERSON> said it would offer to buy <ORGANIZATION>Dome Petroleum</ORGANIZATION>'s remaining 1.5 million shares in <ORGANIZATION>Dome Mines</ORGANIZATION> if certain regulatory approvals can be obtained or waived. 
Under Ontario securities regulations, such approval is usually required if a buyer wishes to purchase <PERCENT>20%</PERCENT> or more of a company without extending the offer to all shareholders. 
<ORGANIZATION>Dome Petroleum</ORGANIZATION>'s shares represent about <PERCENT>21.5%</PERCENT> of <ORGANIZATION>Dome Mines</ORGANIZATION>. 

   <LOCATION>Calgary</LOCATION>, Alberta-based <ORGANIZATION>Dome Petroleum</ORGANIZATION> said it expects to respond to the offer by <DATE>Friday</DATE>, which is when it expires. 
The sale would need approval from creditors whose loans to <ORGANIZATION>Dome Petroleum</ORGANIZATION> are secured by its <ORGANIZATION>Dome Mines</ORGANIZATION> shares. 
The creditors would receive about <PERCENT>75%</PERCENT> of the proceeds if the offer were accepted, <ORGANIZATION>Dome Petroleum</ORGANIZATION> said. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Dome Mines</ORGANIZATION>, Toronto-based <ORGANIZATION>Campbell</ORGANIZATION> and Vancouver-based <LOCATION>Placer</LOCATION> said they still intend to proceed with the proposed merger. 

   Analysts were generally negative toward <ORGANIZATION>Giant Yellowknife</ORGANIZATION>'s offer. 
<PERSON>John Lydall</PERSON>, of <ORGANIZATION>First Marathon Securities Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Toronto</LOCATION>, said the price offered to <ORGANIZATION>Dome Petroleum</ORGANIZATION> for its <ORGANIZATION>Dome Mines</ORGANIZATION> shares is no higher than the price <ORGANIZATION>Dome Petroleum</ORGANIZATION> would receive in the form of stock from the merger of the three companies. 

   Giant <PERSON>Yellowknife</PERSON> said it plans no follow-up offer to <ORGANIZATION>Dome Mines</ORGANIZATION>' remaining holders. 
It said that if its offer is accepted by <ORGANIZATION>Dome Petroleum</ORGANIZATION> and the gold company merger is approved, it will consider exercising certain rights under Canadian law that could force Dome Mines to buy back <ORGANIZATION>Giant Yellowknife</ORGANIZATION>'s holdings in the company. 
The merger plan requires approval by two-thirds of <ORGANIZATION>Dome Mines</ORGANIZATION>' holders. 

   Giant <PERSON>Yellowknife</PERSON> said it would finance purchase of the <ORGANIZATION>Dome Mines</ORGANIZATION> stake by borrowing from <ORGANIZATION>Giant Resources Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <LOCATION>Ariadne Australia</LOCATION>. 
It said it planned to retire the debt through a rights issue to its shareholders. 
It also said it has arranged, subject to regulatory approval, for a private placement of 1.4 million <ORGANIZATION>Giant Yellowknife</ORGANIZATION> shares with <ORGANIZATION>Giant Resources</ORGANIZATION> at <MONEY>28.25 dollars</MONEY> each. 

   Giant Yellowknife currently has 6.9 million shares outstanding. 
Its shares closed at <MONEY>27.25 dollars</MONEY>, down <MONEY>75 cents</MONEY>, in trading <DATE>Friday</DATE> on the <ORGANIZATION>Toronto Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>. 

   Giant <LOCATION>Yellowknife</LOCATION>, which expects to produce about 200,000 ounces of gold from five mines this year, was indirectly acquired by Ariadne earlier this year. 
Ariadne, through <ORGANIZATION>Giant Resources</ORGANIZATION>, since has acquired a zinc and lead mine in <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>'s Yukon. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Dome Mines</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Campbell</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Placer</LOCATION> had <DATE>1986</DATE> combined gold production of 825,000 ounces, more than any single producer outside <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>. 
Analysts estimate output of the amalgamated company would rise to 1.1 million ounces by <DATE>1989</DATE>. 
Placer also has copper, silver and oil and gas interests.

   TORONTO -- Corona Corp. radically altered its plans to
secure control of Canada's hottest gold prospect and said it
would pursue talks with rival Placer Dome Inc. Analysts and
some Corona officials expect the talks will result in joint
ownership of the rich ore deposit.
   Corona said it was pressured to change its plans after
Murray Pezim, a Corona director and honorary chairman,
refused to deliver to Corona his shares in Prime Resources
Group Inc. under a previous agreement. Mr. Pezim also is
chairman of Prime Resources, which owns, together with
Stikine Resources Ltd., the Eskay Creek gold property in
northwestern British Columbia.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   <LOCATION>Eskay Creek</LOCATION> has estimated reserves of about 4.8 million
ounces of gold, worth about <MONEY>$1.73 billion</MONEY> at current market
prices.
   Under its revised proposal, Toronto-based <PERSON>Corona</PERSON> said it
dropped plans to spin off its gold assets into a separately
listed subsidiary and to acquire <ORGANIZATION>Prime Resources</ORGANIZATION> by swapping
shares in the subsidiary.
   Corona also said it improved the terms of an offer to
<ORGANIZATION>Stikine</ORGANIZATION>'s major shareholders, who had committed to Corona
their <PERCENT>42%</PERCENT> stake. For each <ORGANIZATION>Stikine</ORGANIZATION> share, holders will receive
one new Corona preferred share that will be redeemable at a
later date into either 8.5 Corona Class A subordinate voting
shares or <MONEY>70 Canadian dollars</MONEY> (US$60.14) in cash. Corona said
it plans to offer, subject to regulatory approval, the same
terms to other <ORGANIZATION>Stikine</ORGANIZATION> holders to increase its stake to <PERCENT>55%</PERCENT>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Placer Dome</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Vancouver</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>British Columbia</LOCATION>, gold mining
concern, has offered C$67.50 a share for <ORGANIZATION>Stikine</ORGANIZATION>, valuing the
company at about <MONEY>C$225 million</MONEY>. The bid by <LOCATION>Placer</LOCATION>, which
already owns <PERCENT>45%</PERCENT> of <ORGANIZATION>Stikine</ORGANIZATION>'s shares, expired yesterday, but
the company said it wouldn't have final bid results until
today.
   Corona said it agreed to acquire a <PERCENT>7%</PERCENT> stake in <ORGANIZATION>Prime
Resources</ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION>Vancouver</LOCATION> financier <PERSON>Jim Pattison</PERSON>. The purchase
price is one Corona Class A share and an amount in cash to
bring the value of the transaction to <MONEY>C$9</MONEY> a share. Corona
said it also obtained voting rights over the rest of <PERSON>Mr.
Pattison</PERSON>'s holdings in <ORGANIZATION>Prime Resources</ORGANIZATION>, bringing <ORGANIZATION>Corona</ORGANIZATION>'s
voting control in Prime to <PERCENT>34%</PERCENT> from <PERCENT>20%</PERCENT> currently.
   As previously reported, <PERSON>Mr. Pezim</PERSON>, the Corona director,
refused to turn over his shares to <ORGANIZATION>Corona</ORGANIZATION>'s offer unless the
terms were improved. <PERSON>Mr. Pezim</PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION>Corona</ORGANIZATION>'s latest offer "is
what we wanted in the first place."
   But Corona spokesman <PERSON>Brian Hay</PERSON> said the company hadn't
made any new offers for <PERSON>Mr. Pezim</PERSON>'s holdings. He said <PERSON>Corona</PERSON>
decided not to take <PERSON>Mr. Pezim</PERSON> to court over the previous
agreement to deliver his <ORGANIZATION>Prime Resources</ORGANIZATION> shares because of
the cost of such a procedure.
   On the <ORGANIZATION>Toronto Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>, Corona Class A shares
closed unchanged yesterday at <MONEY>C$7.625</MONEY> after rising <MONEY>25
Canadian cents</MONEY> on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> following the <ORGANIZATION>Corona</ORGANIZATION> announcement.
<ORGANIZATION>Stikine</ORGANIZATION> shares closed yesterday at C$70, down C$2, after
closing unchanged a day earlier. <ORGANIZATION>Placer Dome</ORGANIZATION> shares rose <MONEY>50
Canadian cents</MONEY> <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> and <MONEY>12.5 Canadian cents</MONEY> yesterday to
finish at <MONEY>C$18.50</MONEY>. On the <ORGANIZATION>Vancouver Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Prime
Resources</ORGANIZATION> shares closed yesterday at <MONEY>C$8.50</MONEY>, up <MONEY>37.5 Canadian
cents</MONEY>, after losing <MONEY>87.5 Canadian cents</MONEY> on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Mr. Hay</PERSON> said he expects talks between Corona and <ORGANIZATION>Placer
Dome</ORGANIZATION> to result in a merger of <ORGANIZATION>Stikine</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Prime Resources</ORGANIZATION>
into an operating company to develop the <LOCATION>Eskay</LOCATION> creek ore
deposit. Production at <ORGANIZATION>Eskay Creek</ORGANIZATION> isn't expected to begin
before <DATE>1993</DATE>.
   "I see a joint venture between <LOCATION>Placer</LOCATION> and Corona on this
thing," <PERSON>Mr. Pezim</PERSON> said.
   <PERSON>Hugh Leggatt</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Placer Dome</ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said, "We'd like to
reach an agreement with them {<PERSON>Corona</PERSON>} on the disposition of
the <LOCATION>Eskay Creek</LOCATION> assets. In principle we're quite prepared to
speak with them."

   VANCOUVER, British Columbia -- International Corona Corp.
announced a plan that would split Corona into two companies
and loosen mining financier Ned Goodman's control over its
gold assets.
   Under terms of the plan, Corona would keep the gold
assets, but its two classes of stock would be replaced with a
single class of shares with equal voting rights. Holders also
would get shares in Dundee Bancorp Inc., a Corona subsidiary
based in Toronto. Corona would spin off Dundee, and transfer
to the subsidiary its interests in oil and gas, industrial
minerals and merchant banking.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Corona put a value of <MONEY>281.4 million Canadian dollars</MONEY>
(<MONEY>US$244.8 million</MONEY>) on its non-gold assets.
   Analysts said the restructuring likely would bolster the
market valuation of Corona's gold assets, making it easier
for the company to raise equity financing to develop its next
big gold project, the <LOCATION>Eskay Creek</LOCATION> deposit in northern <LOCATION>British
Columbia</LOCATION>. They said the improved investor opinion would
reflect in part the company's plans to abandon its
much-criticized multiple-share structure, which gives <PERSON>Mr.
Goodman</PERSON> and a few associates control of <PERCENT>70%</PERCENT> of the votes in
<LOCATION>Corona</LOCATION> with less than <PERCENT>4%</PERCENT> of the equity.
   Shares in <ORGANIZATION>Dundee Bancorp</ORGANIZATION>, however, likely would suffer, as
the subsidiary would maintain a two-tiered share structure
that keeps <PERSON>Mr. Goodman</PERSON> and others firmly in control of voting
rights, analysts said. <PERSON>Mr. Goodman</PERSON> would serve as chairman
and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION>Dundee Bancorp</ORGANIZATION>, whose assets
would include a one-third stake in <ORGANIZATION>Poco Petroleums Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, a
Canadian oil and gas concern. Dundee also would be the
biggest shareholder in <LOCATION>Corona</LOCATION>, with a <PERCENT>30%</PERCENT> stake.
   In late trading on the <ORGANIZATION>American Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> yesterday,
Corona Class A shares were quoted at <MONEY>$7.50</MONEY>, down <MONEY>50 cents</MONEY> a
share. The Class B multiple voting shares finished on the
<ORGANIZATION>Toronto Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> at <MONEY>C$9.375</MONEY>, down <MONEY>87.5 Canadian cents</MONEY>.
   The restructuring will allow investors to choose between
<ORGANIZATION>Corona</ORGANIZATION>'s gold assets and <PERSON>Mr. Goodman</PERSON>'s enterprising style,
said <PERSON>Barry Allan</PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION>Deacon Barclays de Zoete Wedd
Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> "You can either play gold or you can play <PERSON>Ned</PERSON>, who has
demonstrated that he can put deals together," he said.
   <PERSON>Mr. Goodman</PERSON>, with little cash but a knack for creative
financing, helped build Corona from a hodgepodge of small
mining outfits into a major concern that produces about 700
ounces of gold annually.
   Under terms of the plan, which is subject to regulatory
and shareholder approvals, shareholders would exchange 100
Corona shares of either class for 70 new Corona shares and 30
shares and 25 warrants of <ORGANIZATION>Dundee Bancorp</ORGANIZATION>. Dundee would pay
<ORGANIZATION>Corona</ORGANIZATION> <MONEY>C$100 million</MONEY> in cash, which the company said it would
use to pay off debt. The transaction is expected to be
completed in <DATE>October</DATE>, <PERSON>Corona</PERSON> said.
   Separately, <PERSON>Peter Steen</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Corona</ORGANIZATION>'s president and chief
executive officer, said the company had resumed talks with
<ORGANIZATION>Placer Dome Inc.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Vancouver</LOCATION> about jointly developing the
<LOCATION>Eskay Creek</LOCATION> deposit, which contains an estimated 3.2 million
ounces of gold. The two concerns have been at loggerheads
since <DATE>last year</DATE> when they launched competing bids to acquire
the companies that own the property.
   "I think we're getting to the point where we feel we'll
have a suitable arrangement" with <ORGANIZATION>Placer Dome</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Steen</PERSON>
said.
   Although <PERSON>Corona</PERSON> has the dominant ownership position at
<LOCATION>Eskay Creek</LOCATION>, it has large debts and little cash. Placer
Dome's deep pockets could be invaluable in financing the
development of the mine, which analysts estimate will cost
some <MONEY>C$200 million</MONEY>.

   TORONTO -- Corona Corp. director Murray Pezim said the
company will announce today an improved offer for Stikine
Resources Ltd., upping the ante in a battle for control of a
Canadian gold property.
   Mr. Pezim also said Corona, based here, will announce
plans to spin off its gold assets into a separately listed
company that would offer to acquire all the shares of Prime
Resources Group Inc. Prime Resources is Stikine's partner and
the operator of the promising Eskay Creek gold project in
northwestern British Columbia. Corona already owns 20% of the
stock in Prime Resources, of which Mr. Pezim is chairman.
Prime Resources and Stikine are both based in Vancouver.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   <PERSON>Mr. Pezim</PERSON>'s disclosure unravels efforts by <ORGANIZATION>Corona</ORGANIZATION>'s
management to keep the news under wraps until <TIME>this morning</TIME>.
Trading in shares of <LOCATION>Corona</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Stikine</ORGANIZATION> and Prime has been
halted since last week.
   <PERSON>Mr. Pezim</PERSON>, who is also honorary chairman of <LOCATION>Corona</LOCATION>, has
been in hot water before with the company's management. In a
fiery <DATE>1987</DATE> boardroom battle, <PERSON>Mr. Pezim</PERSON>, commonly known as
"the Pez," was ousted from an executive position amid
management charges that he had talked to the media about
proposed Corona transactions that hadn't been considered by
the Corona board.
   A <ORGANIZATION>Corona</ORGANIZATION> spokesman wouldn't comment on the accuracy of the
latest disclosures, but said <ORGANIZATION>Corona</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Ned Goodman</PERSON> was
"very concerned" about <PERSON>Mr. Pezim</PERSON>'s statements. "<PERSON>Murray</PERSON> talked
when he shouldn't have," the spokesman said.
   According to <PERSON>Mr. Pezim</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Corona</ORGANIZATION> will offer 6.5 Corona Class
A shares and two <ORGANIZATION>Prime Resources</ORGANIZATION> shares for each share of
<ORGANIZATION>Stikine</ORGANIZATION>.
   The revised Corona offer would have an indicated value of
about <MONEY>257.3 million Canadian dollars</MONEY> (<MONEY>US$219.6 million</MONEY>), or
<MONEY>C$75.69</MONEY> a <ORGANIZATION>Stikine</ORGANIZATION> share, based on market prices before the
trading halt went into effect. This is higher than a rival
bid by <ORGANIZATION>Placer Dome Inc.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Vancouver</LOCATION>, which has offered
<MONEY>C$229.5 million</MONEY>, or <MONEY>C$67.50</MONEY> for each <ORGANIZATION>Stikine</ORGANIZATION> share. Placer is
offering cash with a share alternative.
   Despite a possibly higher offer from <LOCATION>Corona</LOCATION>, analysts
weren't convinced that the <LOCATION>Placer</LOCATION> bid would be the less
favorable of the two. The gap between the bids "is quickly
closed when one considers one {offer} is cash and the other
isn't," said <PERSON>Egizio Bianchini</PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION>Nesbitt Thomson
Deacon Inc</ORGANIZATION>.
   Corona's previous offer involved a complex plan under
which it would acquire a <PERCENT>44.6%</PERCENT> stake in a company that was to
be formed from the merger of <ORGANIZATION>Stikine</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Prime Resources</ORGANIZATION>. In
exchange, <ORGANIZATION>Corona</ORGANIZATION> was to issue to <ORGANIZATION>Stikine</ORGANIZATION> holders a package of
securities that analysts valued at anywhere from <MONEY>C$65</MONEY> to <MONEY>C$70</MONEY>
a <ORGANIZATION>Stikine</ORGANIZATION> share.
   <PERSON>Mr. Pezim</PERSON> said that under <ORGANIZATION>Corona</ORGANIZATION>'s plan to spin off its
gold assets, shareholders will receive one share in the new
gold company for every 2.27 Corona shares currently held.
   Corona is one of <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION>'s biggest gold-mining
concerns, with production last year of about 680,000 ounces
of gold. The company also has interests in industrial
minerals and oil and gas.
   "At the end, Corona will control <PERCENT>45%</PERCENT>" of the new gold
company, <PERSON>Mr. Pezim</PERSON> said. He said the gold subsidiary will be
based in <LOCATION>Vancouver</LOCATION>, with <PERSON>Peter Steen</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Corona</ORGANIZATION>'s president and
chief executive, serving as chairman of the new company. <PERSON>John
Ivany</PERSON>, president and chief executive of <ORGANIZATION>Prime Resources</ORGANIZATION>, will
serve in the same roles at the new company, <PERSON>Mr. Pezim</PERSON> said.
   <PERSON>Mr. Pezim</PERSON> said the new gold company will then bid to
acquire <ORGANIZATION>Prime Resources</ORGANIZATION>, offering one share of the new gold
company for each <ORGANIZATION>Prime Resources</ORGANIZATION> share.

   Corona Corp., Toronto, said it will acquire a 44.6% stake
in a new company to be formed through the proposed merger of
two mining companies, Stikine Resources Ltd. and Prime
Resources Group Inc., both based in Vancouver, British
Columbia.
   Corona said it will acquire the stake in exchange for 16.6

   CALGARY, Alberta -- Gulf Canada Resources Ltd. said it was
again seeking a buyer for its 92% stake in Asamera Minerals
Inc., a precious-metal concern, as part of an effort to
reduce debt.
   Gulf Canada, controlled by Toronto's Reichmann family,
pulled the Asamera stake off the market last spring because
of low gold prices. The gold price has barely changed since
then, but a Gulf spokesman said the company recently has been
contacted by parties wondering if the stake still was for
sale. He said there aren't any formal discussions currently
taking place.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The spokesman said that <ORGANIZATION>Asamera</ORGANIZATION> doesn't fit with <LOCATION>Gulf
Canada</LOCATION>'s strategy of concentrating on its principal business
of oil and gas production and development. He said <LOCATION>Gulf
Canada</LOCATION> wants to reduce its long-term debt to about <MONEY>500
million Canadian dollars</MONEY> (<MONEY>$431.2 million</MONEY>) by the end of this
year from <MONEY>C$902 million</MONEY> at <DATE>Dec. 31, 1990</DATE>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Asamera</ORGANIZATION>'s main asset is a <PERCENT>51%</PERCENT> stake in the Cannon gold and
silver mine at <LOCATION>Wenatchee</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wash.</LOCATION>, which last year produced
149,330 ounces of gold. Analysts estimate <LOCATION>Gulf Canada</LOCATION>'s
holding in <ORGANIZATION>Asamera</ORGANIZATION> could fetch between <MONEY>C$50 million</MONEY> and <MONEY>C$75
million</MONEY>.
   <LOCATION>Vancouver</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>British Columbia-based Corona Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, a big gold
producer that indirectly holds an interest in the Cannon mine
through an affiliate, <ORGANIZATION>Breakwater Resources Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, said it
would "take another look" at the <ORGANIZATION>Asamera</ORGANIZATION> stake. Corona last
year ended a pact to purchase the stake for about <MONEY>C$100
million</MONEY> in stock.
   Vancouver-based Breakwater, in which <ORGANIZATION>Corona</ORGANIZATION> holds a <PERCENT>27%</PERCENT>
interest, owns <PERCENT>49%</PERCENT> of the Cannon mine.
   Separately, <ORGANIZATION>Asamera</ORGANIZATION> reported a loss for <DATE>1990</DATE> of <MONEY>C$5.2
million</MONEY>, or <MONEY>21 Canadian cents</MONEY> a share, after writing down
<MONEY>C$6.9 million</MONEY> in deferred exploration costs. A year earlier,
<ORGANIZATION>Asamera</ORGANIZATION> had net income of <MONEY>C$2 million</MONEY>, or <MONEY>eight Canadian

<HL> Newmont Mining, Banks Are Negotiating Million-Ounce Gold Loan, Sources Say </HL>

<SO> </SO>
<CO> NEM NGC </CO>
<IN> PCS CMD </IN>
<TEXT>
   <ORGANIZATION>Newmont Mining Corp.</ORGANIZATION> is negotiating with a syndicate of international banks to arrange a million-ounce gold loan, more than twice the size of any existing gold-based loan, bank and investment executives said. 

   In trading late <DATE>Friday</DATE> on the <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> Metal Exchange the spot price of gold was quoted at <MONEY>$477</MONEY> an ounce, giving <ORGANIZATION>Newmont</ORGANIZATION>'s planned loan an indicated value of <MONEY>$477 million</MONEY>. 
If <ORGANIZATION>Newmont</ORGANIZATION> obtains the gold loan, banking and gold mining executives say its unprecedented size will enhance the popularity and credibility of this low-cost financing technique that is helping to fuel a boom in <LOCATION>North American</LOCATION> and Australian gold production. 

   <PERSON>Peter Munk</PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION>Toronto-based American Barrick Resources Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, said a million-ounce gold loan "could be a turning point" for the gold mining industry. 
Banks have been cautious about lending large amounts of gold and haven't lent more than 400,000 ounces to any one borrower. 
American <ORGANIZATION>Barrick</ORGANIZATION> borrowed 264,000 ounces of gold last fall. 

   "It would certainly add a lot of credence to the market," said <PERSON>Anthony Walsh</PERSON>, treasurer and vice president of <ORGANIZATION>Toronto-based Royex Gold Mining Corp</ORGANIZATION>. 

   T. <PERSON>Peter Philip</PERSON>, senior vice president of <ORGANIZATION>New York-based Newmont Mining</ORGANIZATION>, declined to comment. 
Banking and investment executives said <ORGANIZATION>Bank of Nova Scotia</ORGANIZATION> is leading the syndicate and <ORGANIZATION>Newmont</ORGANIZATION> plans to create a new holding company to borrow the gold. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Newmont</ORGANIZATION> is expected to use the loan to refinance some of the <MONEY>$2 billion</MONEY> it borrowed last <DATE>September</DATE> when it paid a special dividend of <MONEY>$33</MONEY> a share to thwart a takeover bid from a group led by <PERSON>T. Boone Pickens Jr</PERSON>. Bank executives said the gold loan probably will have a five-year term with an annual interest rate of about <PERCENT>1.5%</PERCENT>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Newmont</ORGANIZATION> would repay the loan with gold produced by its <PERCENT>90%</PERCENT>-owned <ORGANIZATION>Newmont Gold Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION>'s largest gold producer. 
In trading on the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> <DATE>Friday</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Newmont Mining</ORGANIZATION> closed at <MONEY>$34.875</MONEY>, down <MONEY>25 cents</MONEY>. 

   Gold loans have tended to have terms of less than three years and are used primarily to fund working capital. 
<ORGANIZATION>Newmont</ORGANIZATION>'s planned five-year loan apparently signals banks' willingness to lend gold for long-term uses. 

   Gold loans are gaining popularity because of their low cost and diminishing investor appetite for new gold shares in the wake of the stock market crash. 
"If the stock market isn't available, gold loans are the best alternative," said <PERSON>Ray Jenner</PERSON>, treasurer of <LOCATION>Edmonton</LOCATION>, Alberta-based <ORGANIZATION>Echo Bay Mines Ltd</ORGANIZATION>. 

   "There's going to be a lot of new gold mines coming into production and more of the financing will come from gold loans," said <PERSON>Gordon Hawke</PERSON>, a senior manager with <ORGANIZATION>Royal Bank of Canada</ORGANIZATION>. 

   Typically, when a mining company borrows gold from a bank it agrees to repay the gold in installments to the bank with gold produced at its mines. 
Borrowers can receive cash for a gold loan by selling the borrowed gold. 

   Banks have lent small amounts of gold for decades to borrowers such as jewelers, who use gold in their business. 
But it was only in <DATE>1985</DATE> that gold mining companies began to borrow significant amounts of gold to help finance their operations. 
Echo <ORGANIZATION>Bay Mines</ORGANIZATION> says it was the first in <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION> to use the technique in <DATE>March 1985</DATE> when it borrowed 100,000 ounces. 

   Since then, investment officials estimate the equivalent of about <MONEY>$2 billion</MONEY> has been lent in gold to mining companies. 
Gold loans are an attractive form of debt because annual interest rates of between <PERCENT>1.5%</PERCENT> and <PERCENT>3%</PERCENT> are significantly lower than those charged on bank loans or bonds. 
Gold loans would be highly risky for nongold producers because gold prices could rise when the loan has to be repaid. 
Mining companies are protected from such risks as long as they can produce gold. 

   Rates are so low on gold loans because financial institutions are lending gold that would otherwise sit in vaults. 
Most commercial banks borrow gold from financial companies that own gold bullion or from central banks that act as agents for their governments' gold reserves. 
The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> doesn't lend its gold to commercial banks, but <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> and certain European and Asian countries do through their central banks. 

   Central banks and financial companies usually charge rates of less than <PERCENT>1%</PERCENT> on gold loans and restrict their lending to major commercial banks. 
"It's a way of earning a return on gold. 
Otherwise, it just sits in the basement," said a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION>Bank of Canada</ORGANIZATION>, the country's central bank. 

   Some bankers and investment officials, however, are concerned about the increasing size of gold loans. 
<ORGANIZATION>Newmont</ORGANIZATION>'s planned one-million ounce loan suprised some observers because it exceeds <ORGANIZATION>Newmont Gold</ORGANIZATION>'s projected gold production of 930,000 ounces in <DATE>1988</DATE>. 

   Although the gold can be repaid over several years, some bankers said <ORGANIZATION>Newmont Gold</ORGANIZATION> will be under much pressure to increase its gold output so that it can repay the debt without reducing its gold sales. 
Newmont Gold recently forecast that its annual gold production will rise to 1.6 million ounces by <DATE>1990</DATE>. 

   "People are losing sight of the risks of gold loans," said one investment banker who declined to be identified. 
"What happens if a company has production problems and it can't produce gold at a time gold prices are rising? 
How will they repay the loan?" he asked.

   TORONTO -- Corona Corp. said it agreed to make an improved
offer to acquire the joint owners of a new gold property in a
move to head off a takeover bid by Placer Dome Inc.
   Corona also said it raised its holdings in the two
concerns, Stikine Resources Ltd. and Prime Resources Group
Inc., both of Vancouver, British Columbia.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Toronto-based <PERSON>Corona</PERSON> said it plans to merge the two
companies into a new subsidiary to be created through the
spinoff of <ORGANIZATION>Corona</ORGANIZATION>'s gold assets. Corona will retain a <PERCENT>50.2%</PERCENT>
interest in the new company, to be known as <ORGANIZATION>Corona Gold Corp</ORGANIZATION>.
Corona will remain as a holding company with interests in oil
and gas, industrial minerals, gold and financial services.
   Corona said it advanced its restructuring plans by as much
as 18 months in response to a takeover bid for <ORGANIZATION>Stikine</ORGANIZATION> by
<LOCATION>Placer</LOCATION>. The Vancouver-based mining concern has offered <MONEY>67.50
Canadian dollars</MONEY> (<MONEY>US$57.50</MONEY>) a share, valuing all of <ORGANIZATION>Stikine</ORGANIZATION>
at <MONEY>229.5 million Canadian dollars</MONEY>.
   The takeover battle is being fought over the <LOCATION>Eskay Creek</LOCATION>
gold deposit located in northwestern <LOCATION>British Columbia</LOCATION>. The
property's estimated reserves to date total about 4.8 million
ounces of gold or equivalent, valued at about <MONEY>US$1.71
billion</MONEY>.
   <PERSON>Ned Goodman</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Corona</ORGANIZATION>'s chairman, said the company last week
bought more shares in <ORGANIZATION>Prime Resources</ORGANIZATION>, raising its stake to
<PERCENT>45%</PERCENT> from <PERCENT>21%</PERCENT>. He said Corona obtained an option from
<ORGANIZATION>Stikine</ORGANIZATION>'s principal holders that would boost its stake there

   Corona will offer 6.5 of its shares and two shares of
Corona Gold for each <ORGANIZATION>Stikine</ORGANIZATION> share. Stikine holders will be
eligible to receive, for each Corona share, 0.38 share of
Corona Gold as part of a special dividend payment to be made

   Shareholders of <ORGANIZATION>Dome Mines Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, its <ORGANIZATION>Campbell Red Lake Mines Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> unit and <ORGANIZATION>Placer Development Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> approved a previously reported agreement to merge, creating <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION>'s biggest gold mining concern. 

   The new company, <ORGANIZATION>Placer Dome Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, expects to produce more than 800,000 ounces of gold this year, more than any gold producer outside <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>, but only a small portion of world-wide gold production, which totaled 50.2 million ounces in <DATE>1986</DATE>. 

   Placer Dome's shares were to be listed for trading today on stock exchanges in <LOCATION>Toronto</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Montreal</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. 
The company has applied to list its shares on the <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> stock exchange and on exchanges in <LOCATION>Vancouver</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>British Columbia</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>. 

   Under terms of the merger, shareholders of the three concerns exchanged their holdings for <ORGANIZATION>Placer Dome</ORGANIZATION> shares at varying conversion rates, with one <ORGANIZATION>Placer Dome</ORGANIZATION> share equal to one share of <LOCATION>Vancouver</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>British Columbia-based Placer Development</ORGANIZATION>. 
In trading yesterday on the <ORGANIZATION>Toronto Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Placer Development</ORGANIZATION> closed at <MONEY>26.125 Canadian dollars</MONEY> (<MONEY>$19.65</MONEY>), down <MONEY>12.5 cents</MONEY>. 

   Placer Dome will have about 219.2 million shares outstanding and a market capitalization of about <MONEY>5.7 billion dollars</MONEY> (<MONEY>$4.3 billion</MONEY>). 

   The merger gives <ORGANIZATION>Dome Mines</ORGANIZATION> substantial gold production outside of <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> and largely reduces the potential impact of a loan guarantee extended by <ORGANIZATION>Dome Mines</ORGANIZATION> to debt-laden <ORGANIZATION>Dome Petroleum Ltd</ORGANIZATION>. 
The merger also reduces the large oil and gas concern's <PERCENT>21.5%</PERCENT> stake in <ORGANIZATION>Dome Mines</ORGANIZATION> to about <PERCENT>8%</PERCENT> of <ORGANIZATION>Placer Dome</ORGANIZATION>. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Placer Development</ORGANIZATION> gains significant North American gold production to complement its holdings in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New Guinea</LOCATION>. 
Placer also gains a connection with <ORGANIZATION>Falconbridge Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, a large Toronto-based mining concern with interests in nickel, zinc and copper, in which <ORGANIZATION>Dome Mines</ORGANIZATION> held a <PERCENT>24.9%</PERCENT> interest on a fully diluted basis. 

   Analysts generally approved of the merger. 
"It's the first of the new generation of gold mining companies to be a true multinational," said <PERSON>John Lydall</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>First Marathon Securities Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Toronto</LOCATION>. 

   Placer Dome has two head offices, in <LOCATION>Toronto</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Vancouver</LOCATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Dome Mines Chairman Fraser Fell</ORGANIZATION> will continue as chairman of the new company. 
<PERSON>John Walton</PERSON>, president and chief executive officer of <LOCATION>Placer</LOCATION>, will retain the same posts at <ORGANIZATION>Placer Dome</ORGANIZATION>. 

   The merger ends efforts by another <LOCATION>Toronto</LOCATION> gold producer, <ORGANIZATION>Giant Yellowknife Mines Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, to gain control of <ORGANIZATION>Dome Mines</ORGANIZATION>. 
Last week, <ORGANIZATION>Dome Petroleum</ORGANIZATION> rejected an offer by <ORGANIZATION>Giant Yellowknife</ORGANIZATION> to acquire its block of <ORGANIZATION>Dome Mines</ORGANIZATION> shares. 

   Giant <PERSON>Yellowknife</PERSON> said it "wouldn't rule out" the possibility that it may try to acquire a sizable position in <LOCATION>Placer Dome</LOCATION>.

   <ORGANIZATION>Scintilore Explorations Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, a Montreal-based mineral exploration firm, launched an action in the <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Ontario</LOCATION> against several prospectors and companies involved in developing the province's <ORGANIZATION>Hemlo</ORGANIZATION> gold camp. 

   In its filing, <PERSON>Scintilore</PERSON> said it seeks an order that would give it assets and royalties currently received by the prospectors, <PERSON>John Larche</PERSON> and <PERSON>Donald McKinnon</PERSON>. 
Under terms of their agreements with the owners of two of <ORGANIZATION>Hemlo</ORGANIZATION>'s three large gold mines, <PERSON>Messrs. 
Larche</PERSON> and <PERSON>McKinnon</PERSON> hold shares and cash and receive royalties on the mines' production. 

   Scintilore said that <PERSON>Mr. Larche</PERSON>, while indirectly employed by Scintilore in <DATE>1979</DATE> to stake properties in the then-undeveloped <ORGANIZATION>Hemlo</ORGANIZATION> area, "failed or refused" to do so, instead staking claims "for himself and for his own benefit." 
Scintilore alleged that <PERSON>Mr. McKinnon</PERSON>, who also was prospecting in the area, pooled his claims with <PERSON>Mr. Larche</PERSON> for "their joint benefit." 

   The prospectors subsequently sold some of the claims to <ORGANIZATION>Teck Corp.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Vancouver</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>International Corona Resources Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Toronto</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Hemlo Gold Mines Inc</ORGANIZATION>. 

   Scintilore said it didn't become aware of "the material facts" until <DATE>November</DATE> of last year. 
<PERSON>Theodore Polisuk</PERSON>, president of Scintilore, declined to elaborate on the court filing. 

   Messrs. 
<PERSON>Larche</PERSON> and <PERSON>McKinnon</PERSON> couldn't immediately be reached for comment. 

   Teck jointly operates <ORGANIZATION>Hemlo</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>David Bell</PERSON> mine with <ORGANIZATION>International Corona</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Hemlo Gold Mines</ORGANIZATION> is owner of the Golden Giant mine. 
Hemlo Gold is <PERCENT>50%</PERCENT>-owned by <ORGANIZATION>Noranda Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Toronto</LOCATION>. 

   Proceeds to the prospectors include <PERCENT>3%</PERCENT> royalties on the mines' gold production. 
Messrs. 
<PERSON>Larche</PERSON> and <PERSON>McKinnon</PERSON> also hold 400,000 shares of <LOCATION>Corona</LOCATION>, about 2,660,000 shares of <ORGANIZATION>Hemlo Gold</ORGANIZATION>, and "substantial" cash, <PERSON>Scintilore</PERSON> said. 

   How much revenue accrues from the royalties wasn't clear. 
At the close of trading yesterday on the <ORGANIZATION>Toronto Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>, the shares had a combined market value of <MONEY>$89.3 million</MONEY> (Canadian). 

   <ORGANIZATION>Teck</ORGANIZATION>'s president and chief executive officer, <PERSON>Norman Keevil Jr.</PERSON>, said he hadn't been advised of the action and declined comment. 
Executives at <ORGANIZATION>Noranda</ORGANIZATION> and Corona weren't immediately available for comment.

   <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Western Mining Corp</ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION>Holdings Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> agreed to acquire the Canadian gold mining assets of <ORGANIZATION>Northgate Exploration Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> and plans to launch tender offers for two small Canadian gold concerns. 

   The transactions have a total indicated value of <MONEY>259.7 million Canadian dollars</MONEY> (<MONEY>$198.7 million</MONEY>) and follow by four days <ORGANIZATION>Western Mining</ORGANIZATION>'s proposed offer to acquire <ORGANIZATION>Seabright Resources Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, another Canadian gold producer, for <MONEY>92 million dollars</MONEY>. 

   Western Mining, <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s largest gold mining concern, said the moves are part of its plan to form "a significant Canadian mining and exploration company." 
<PERSON>Hugh Morgan</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Western Mining</ORGANIZATION>'s managing director, said the proposed acquisitions would make up "the base" for future growth in <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>. 
He wouldn't say whether additional Canadian acquisitions are planned. 

   In addition to its agreement to acquire <LOCATION>Northgate</LOCATION>'s mining unit for <MONEY>160 million dollars</MONEY>, <ORGANIZATION>Western Mining</ORGANIZATION> said it plans to launch tender offers to acquire <ORGANIZATION>Norbeau Mines Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Vancouver-based Grandview Resources Inc</ORGANIZATION>. Norbeau is <PERCENT>35%</PERCENT>-owned by <LOCATION>Northgate</LOCATION>, which has agreed to tender its shares under the planned offer. 

   Through separate units, <ORGANIZATION>Western Mining</ORGANIZATION> said it would offer <MONEY>22 cents</MONEY> a share, or a total <MONEY>4.7 million dollars</MONEY>, for <ORGANIZATION>Norbeau</ORGANIZATION>, and <MONEY>9.55 dollars</MONEY> a share, or a total <MONEY>95 million dollars</MONEY>, for <LOCATION>Grandview</LOCATION>. 

   Western Mining said it reached agreement with certain <LOCATION>Grandview</LOCATION> directors and holders to tender their combined <PERCENT>15.5%</PERCENT> fully diluted interest under the planned offer, which the company expects to make by <DATE>Jan. 1</DATE>. 
Western Mining currently holds <PERCENT>3.5%</PERCENT> of <LOCATION>Grandview</LOCATION>'s common shares. 

   The planned purchase of the <LOCATION>Northgate</LOCATION> unit, which comprises two <LOCATION>Quebec</LOCATION> mines that produce gold as well as silver and copper, is expected to close in late <DATE>January</DATE>. 
<LOCATION>Northgate</LOCATION> said the planned sale is an opportunity for it to "realize the intrinsic value" of the mines, which it purchased in <DATE>1981</DATE>. 

   <LOCATION>Northgate</LOCATION> declined to estimate the size of an expected gain on the sale. 
The company said net proceeds of about <MONEY>130 million dollars</MONEY> will be mainly used to finance gold mining acquisitions. 
<LOCATION>Northgate</LOCATION> said it will seek pure gold mines only. 

   In trading yesterday on the <ORGANIZATION>Toronto Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Northgate</LOCATION> closed at <MONEY>8.375 dollars</MONEY>, up 1.00 dollar, and <ORGANIZATION>Norbeau</ORGANIZATION> closed at <MONEY>15 cents</MONEY>, unchanged. 
Grandview closed on the <ORGANIZATION>Vancouver Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> at <MONEY>8.50 dollars</MONEY>, up <MONEY>1.50 dollars</MONEY>. 

   If successfully concluded, the proposed Canadian acquisitions would in <DATE>1988</DATE> give Western Mining additional gold output of at least 120,000 ounces, including about 80,000 ounces from <LOCATION>Northgate</LOCATION>'s mines. 
<ORGANIZATION>James Capel &amp; Co.</ORGANIZATION>, a London-based securities dealer, projects gold output of 471,000 ounces from <ORGANIZATION>Western Mining</ORGANIZATION>'s current properties for the current fiscal year. 

   Western Mining's <PERSON>Mr. Morgan</PERSON> said additional gold production in <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> would most likely come from <LOCATION>Seabright</LOCATION>, which has large land holdings in <LOCATION>Nova Scotia</LOCATION>. 
He said it "has yet to be determined" whether Western Mining would merge the Canadian companies into one, once the proposed transactions are concluded.

   The <ORGANIZATION>Ontario Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> dismissed a bid by <ORGANIZATION>LAC Minerals Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> for a new trial to determine ownership of the disputed Page-Williams gold mine, which the court awarded in <DATE>1986</DATE> to a predecessor of <ORGANIZATION>Corona Corp</ORGANIZATION>. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Ontario Supreme Court Justice Coulter Osborne</ORGANIZATION> isn't expected to release his reasons for the ruling until <DATE>Friday</DATE>, officials said. 
Justice <PERSON>Osborne</PERSON> disclosed his decision privately to attorneys yesterday, following a hearing that ended last week. 

   The ruling leaves LAC with one remaining avenue of legal recourse in its long battle with Corona, namely, an appeal before the <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court of Canada</ORGANIZATION>. 
LAC's appeal before the nation's highest court is due to conclude today, but a decision may not be rendered for months, company officials said. 

   "We're certainly pleased with the (<LOCATION>Ontario</LOCATION> court's) decision, but this is one heat only. 
The final is taking place in the Supreme Court of <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>," a <ORGANIZATION>Corona</ORGANIZATION> spokesman said. 
"So while this decision is positive, it's not conclusive." 

   <PERSON>Roland Francisco</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>LAC</ORGANIZATION>'s senior vice president and treasurer, said <ORGANIZATION>Justice Osborne</ORGANIZATION>'s ruling "doesn't change the complexion" of LAC, which excluded Page-Williams from its results after an appeals court last year upheld the <DATE>1986</DATE> Supreme Court of <LOCATION>Ontario</LOCATION> ruling. 

   In upholding the ruling, the appeals court agreed that LAC had in <DATE>1981</DATE> breached a trust with <ORGANIZATION>Corona</ORGANIZATION>'s predecessor, <ORGANIZATION>International Corona Resources Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, regarding a joint exploration venture. 
The court said LAC used confidential information given by <ORGANIZATION>International Corona</ORGANIZATION> to acquire the property where the Page-Williams mine now operates. 

   Toronto-based Corona, one of <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION>'s biggest gold producers, was formed in <DATE>July</DATE> through the merger of <ORGANIZATION>International Corona</ORGANIZATION> and four affiliated companies. 

   In requesting a new trial, LAC said in its court filing that the initial decision in <DATE>1986</DATE> "was obtained by fraud consisting of perjured or intentionally misleading evidence" from <PERSON>Donald McKinnon</PERSON>, a prospector and agent of <ORGANIZATION>Corona</ORGANIZATION>'s predecessor, <ORGANIZATION>International Corona</ORGANIZATION>. 
<PERSON>Mr. McKinnon</PERSON> testified at the original trial and also at the hearing that led to yesterday's ruling. 

   In trading on the <ORGANIZATION>Toronto Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> yesterday, <ORGANIZATION>Corona</ORGANIZATION>'s Class A shares closed at <MONEY>9.625 Canadian dollars</MONEY> (US$9.97), up <MONEY>25 Canadian cents</MONEY>.

<HL> OTC Focus:
Shares Fall 2% in Slower Trading;
Decline Is Spread Evenly Through List

<TEXT>
   The over-the-counter market sank a bit yesterday. 
In fact, prices of most OTC stocks, and nearly every industry group, slumped about <PERCENT>2%</PERCENT>. 

   That's unusual, because the OTC market is usually driven by its large technology sector, which makes volatile twists and turns; or by its huge complement of bank stocks. 
Not yesterday. 

   Computer stocks fell a little less in price than most industry groups, down slightly less than <PERCENT>2%</PERCENT>. 
Apple Computer, the biggest OTC computer manufacturer, was off 1/2 at 37 1/4; <ORGANIZATION>Microsoft</ORGANIZATION>, the biggest OTC-traded software concern, was down 1/2 at 47. 
Bank stocks were also off about <PERCENT>2%</PERCENT>. 

   The <ORGANIZATION>Nasdaq Composite Index</ORGANIZATION> fell 5.96 points to 320.43, a <PERCENT>1.8%</PERCENT> decline. 
Similar declines cut across such industry groups as insurance, telecommunications, biotechnology, industrial service, utility, paper, consumer product and retail stocks. 
Declining issues led advancers by about 2 1/3 to one on both <ORGANIZATION>Nasdaq</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Nasdaq</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>National Market System</ORGANIZATION>, where most of the larger stocks trade. 

   That suggests the <DATE>Monday</DATE> gloom spread evenly through most sizes of stocks, including the small and medium issues, where bargain hunters have been sifting. 
Nasdaq volume slowed to 115.5 million shares yesterday, the lowest since <ORGANIZATION>Nasdaq</ORGANIZATION> trading hours were reduced to help brokers cope with post-crash volume. 
Traders said most bargain hunting went on hold yesterday, apparently to give investors time to assess the impact of the renewed weakness in the dollar on various stocks and industries. 

   Scattered groups with some immediate vulnerability to the dollar's problems were hit slightly harder than the rest of the market. 
The 31 Nasdaq-listed trucking companies, for example, slipped <PERCENT>4%</PERCENT> yesterday. 
<ORGANIZATION>Roadway Services</ORGANIZATION>, the largest, dropped 1 1/2 to 30 1/4, a <PERCENT>4.7%</PERCENT> decline; Yellow Freight Delivery was off 2 3/8 to 27 1/4, an <PERCENT>8%</PERCENT> slide. 
Among the smaller truckers, <ORGANIZATION>Viking Freight</ORGANIZATION> fell 3/4 to 12 3/4; <ORGANIZATION>Circle Express</ORGANIZATION> was down 1/2 to 6; <ORGANIZATION>Marten Transport</ORGANIZATION> fell 3/4 to 6 1/4; <PERSON>Chemical Leaman</PERSON> was off 1 1/4 at 23 1/2; <ORGANIZATION>Freymiller Trucking</ORGANIZATION> fell 3/4 to 7 and <ORGANIZATION>Courier Dispatch</ORGANIZATION> slipped 1/4 to 3 1/2. 

   Even the usual beneficiaries of doom -- the gold stocks -- were hurt yesterday. 
Such stocks blossom with the threat of rising inflation that comes with increases in interest rates, the blow that usually sends <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> stock prices reeling. 
But the weakening dollar brings recession fears, rather than inflationary ones, analysts say. 

   Thus, prices of the 67 <ORGANIZATION>Nasdaq</ORGANIZATION> gold stocks, on average, declined nearly <PERCENT>2%</PERCENT> with the rest of the market yesterday, but the losers were all <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and Canadian-based mining companies. 
Among the larger <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> gold mining stocks, <ORGANIZATION>Coeur d'Alene</ORGANIZATION> fell 1/4 to 16 1/4; <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Mineral Exploration</ORGANIZATION> was unchanged at 3 9/16, and <ORGANIZATION>Royal Gold</ORGANIZATION> fell 1/4 to 5 7/8. 
Among the biggest Canadian-based <ORGANIZATION>Nasdaq</ORGANIZATION> issues, <ORGANIZATION>Pegasus Gold</ORGANIZATION> fell 1/8 to 13 1/4; <ORGANIZATION>Galactic Resources</ORGANIZATION> was off 3/8 to 6 1/8 and <ORGANIZATION>Lacana Mining</ORGANIZATION> fell 3/8 to 8 3/8. 

   South African gold stocks, on the other hand, were up a bit yesterday. 
These issues are largely bought by non-U.S. investors on the <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> or <LOCATION>Johannesburg</LOCATION> stock exchanges, but some shares trade in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> on <ORGANIZATION>Nasdaq</ORGANIZATION>. 
In <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> trading yesterday, <ORGANIZATION>Free State Consolidated Gold Mining</ORGANIZATION> rose 1/4 to 12; <ORGANIZATION>Blyvooruitzicht Gold Mining</ORGANIZATION> rose 1/8 to 5 1/2, and Gold Fields of <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> was up 1/8 to 15.

   International Corona Corp. and Homestake Mining Co. said
they are discussing a possible merger.
   The companies wouldn't disclose the terms of the proposed
transaction. They said in a brief statement that they expect
to announce the outcome of the negotiations early next week.
Corona and Homestake officials declined further comment.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   For <ORGANIZATION>Homestake</ORGANIZATION>, which operates the oldest gold mine in the
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, a link with Corona would provide additional gold
reserves that are relatively cheap to mine, analysts say. At
the same time, a merger would help Corona clean up its
debt-heavy balance sheet and give it the financial muscle to
develop its rich <LOCATION>Eskay Creek</LOCATION> gold prospect in <LOCATION>British
Columbia</LOCATION>.
   Corona, a young company that has scrambled its way to the
top ranks of gold producers, bears little resemblance to the
more traditionally run <ORGANIZATION>Homestake</ORGANIZATION>. Corona, for instance, is a
proponent of gold loans as a means of raising cash. <ORGANIZATION>Homestake</ORGANIZATION>
shuns financing techniques that would prevent its stock from
serving as a proxy for buying bullion.
   "A merger makes a lot of sense to me as a very attractive
situation for both <ORGANIZATION>Homestake</ORGANIZATION> and Corona," said <PERSON>Vahid Fathi</PERSON>,
an analyst at <ORGANIZATION>Kemper Securities Group</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>Mr. Fathi</PERSON> said
concerns about cultural differences is a "luxury that they
can't afford."
   <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Homestake</ORGANIZATION> is one of the biggest gold
producers in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, with output topping one million
ounces. Still, the company has had losses in the past two
years, largely because of the high cost of its mining
operations. Last year, <ORGANIZATION>Homestake</ORGANIZATION> had cash production costs of
about <MONEY>$300</MONEY> an ounce of gold, more than <MONEY>$100</MONEY> an ounce higher
than <ORGANIZATION>Corona</ORGANIZATION>'s costs. A merged company would average out those
production costs.
   Corona, based in <LOCATION>Vancouver</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>British Columbia</LOCATION>, last year
produced about 700,000 ounces of gold. It owns some of the
richest gold properties in <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION> but is bogged down
by debt of some <MONEY>320 million Canadian dollars</MONEY> (<MONEY>US$267.1
million</MONEY>). "<ORGANIZATION>Homestake</ORGANIZATION> certainly brings cash to the table,"
said <PERSON>John Phizackerley</PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION>Lehman Bros</ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION>Homestake</ORGANIZATION>
had <MONEY>$160 million</MONEY> in cash at year end.
   Also involved in the merger discussions is <ORGANIZATION>Dundee Bancorp
Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Toronto</LOCATION> merchant bank that holds about <PERCENT>30%</PERCENT> of
<ORGANIZATION>Corona</ORGANIZATION>'s stock. A <ORGANIZATION>Corona</ORGANIZATION> spokesman said the companies made
the announcement at the request of the <ORGANIZATION>Toronto Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>
following a strong rise in <ORGANIZATION>Corona</ORGANIZATION>'s share price. Trading in
<LOCATION>Corona</LOCATION>'s shares was halted at <MONEY>C$4.50</MONEY>, up <MONEY>30 cents</MONEY>.
   On the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Homestake</ORGANIZATION> shares were
quoted late yesterday at <MONEY>US$15</MONEY>, down <MONEY>25 cents</MONEY>.

   Of $193.8 Million
   For Gold Concern

<LP>
   VANCOUVER, British Columbia -- Cash-rich Placer Dome Inc.
offered 229.5 million Canadian dollars (US$193.8 million) or
C$67.50 a share for Stikine Resources Ltd., 50% owner of
British Columbia's burgeoning Eskay Creek gold deposit.
   The offer, which begins today and expires June 19, is
expected to spark a battle with Toronto's Corona Corp. for
control of the rich deposit. Its reserves to date total 4.8
million contained ounces of gold or equivalent, worth about
US$1.76 billion at current spot prices.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "We see it as very unfriendly. It caught us by surprise,"
said <PERSON>Peter Steen</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Corona</ORGANIZATION>'s chief executive officer. He said
<PERSON>Corona</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Placer Dome</ORGANIZATION> were holding unspecified talks prior
to the offer; an analyst who declined to be indentified said
the companies were studying a possible joint venture at <LOCATION>Eskay
Creek</LOCATION>.
   The shares of <ORGANIZATION>Stikine</ORGANIZATION>, a small Vancouver-based exploration
outfit whose stock traded at less than <MONEY>C$1</MONEY> a share just 18
months ago, rose sharply yesterday in <ORGANIZATION>Toronto Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>
trading, closing at C$68.50 each, up <MONEY>C$7.25</MONEY> and C$1 above
<LOCATION>Placer</LOCATION> Dome's bid price. Placer Dome closed at <MONEY>C$19</MONEY> a share,
unchanged.
   Currently, <ORGANIZATION>Corona</ORGANIZATION> owns <PERCENT>20%</PERCENT> of <ORGANIZATION>Prime Resources Group Inc.</ORGANIZATION>,
<ORGANIZATION>Stikine</ORGANIZATION>'s partner and the operator of the <LOCATION>Eskay Creek</LOCATION>
project, which is in northwestern <ORGANIZATION>British Columbia</ORGANIZATION>. Under a
complex plan announced in <DATE>April</DATE>, Corona proposes to secure
control of <LOCATION>Eskay Creek</LOCATION> by acquiring <PERCENT>44.6%</PERCENT> of a new company
formed through the merger of <ORGANIZATION>Stikine</ORGANIZATION> and Prime.
   Corona's proposal, which still requires shareholder
approvals at meetings expected in <DATE>July</DATE>, calls for <ORGANIZATION>Stikine</ORGANIZATION>
holders to receive a package of securities, including Corona
shares, that analysts value at anywhere from <MONEY>C$65</MONEY> to <MONEY>C$70</MONEY> a
<ORGANIZATION>Stikine</ORGANIZATION> share.
   <ORGANIZATION>Placer Dome</ORGANIZATION>, a big gold producer whose cash holdings will
swell to about <MONEY>C$1 billion</MONEY> with the pending sale of its oil
and gas interests, said it views its bid as "superior" to
<ORGANIZATION>Corona</ORGANIZATION>'s plan. As an alternative to its cash bid, <ORGANIZATION>Placer Dome</ORGANIZATION>
is also offering to swap 3.5 of its shares for each <ORGANIZATION>Stikine</ORGANIZATION>
share.
   Placer Dome's offer, if successful, would block the
planned merger of <ORGANIZATION>Stikine</ORGANIZATION> and Prime, which requires approval
from <PERCENT>75%</PERCENT> of each company's shareholders to proceed. If more
than <PERCENT>25%</PERCENT> of <ORGANIZATION>Stikine</ORGANIZATION>'s shares are tendered to <ORGANIZATION>Placer Dome</ORGANIZATION>'s
offer, therefore, analysts said <ORGANIZATION>Placer Dome</ORGANIZATION> could stymie the
merger plan, as well as <ORGANIZATION>Corona</ORGANIZATION>'s effort to gain control of
<LOCATION>Eskay Creek</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Mr. Steen</PERSON> wouldn't say whether Corona would consider
sweetening the pot for <ORGANIZATION>Stikine</ORGANIZATION> shareholders, though investors
clearly expect a higher offer to come, in view of <ORGANIZATION>Stikine</ORGANIZATION>'s
C$68.50 closing price yesterday.

   VANCOUVER, British Columbia -- Placer Dome Inc., a big
gold producer, said it plans to continue its previously
announced 229.5 million Canadian dollar (US$195.7 million)
offer to acquire Stikine Resources Ltd., half-owner of the
promising Eskay Creek gold project.
   The announcement, which followed last week's disclosure by
Placer Dome that it might withdraw its bid, sparked a sharp
jump in Stikine's share price on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Stikine shares closed yesterday at C$67.375, up C$3.875, on
volume of 186,009 shares.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Separately, <ORGANIZATION>Placer Dome</ORGANIZATION> disclosed late yesterday that it
acquired 40,600 additional <ORGANIZATION>Stikine</ORGANIZATION> shares in open-market
purchases on the <LOCATION>Toronto</LOCATION> exchange, raising <ORGANIZATION>Placer Dome</ORGANIZATION>'s
stake in the company to <PERCENT>5.2%</PERCENT>, from <PERCENT>4.7%</PERCENT>. A spokesman wouldn't
say whether Placer Dome intends to make further open-market
purchases before its bid expires <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
   The share price of <ORGANIZATION>Stikine</ORGANIZATION>, a Vancouver-based gold
exploration company, had slumped after <ORGANIZATION>Placer Dome</ORGANIZATION> said it
might cancel its C$67.50-a-share offer, in view of a lock-up
agreement under which <ORGANIZATION>Stikine</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERCENT>42%</PERCENT> owners agreed to tender
their stock to a rival bidder, <ORGANIZATION>Corona Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, a Toronto-based
gold producer.
   "The market has recognized that the <LOCATION>Placer</LOCATION> Dome offer is
superior to the Corona proposal," <PERSON>Anthony Petrina</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Placer
Dome</ORGANIZATION>'s president and chief executive officer, said. By
threatening to withdraw its bid, "They {<LOCATION>Placer</LOCATION> Dome} were
able to highlight the difference between their offer and
<ORGANIZATION>Corona</ORGANIZATION>'s offer," said <PERSON>Barry Allan</PERSON>, gold analyst with
<ORGANIZATION>Prudential-Bache Securities Canada Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Toronto</LOCATION>.
   Corona has offered to swap 6.5 Corona Class A shares, plus
two shares of a newly created unit, <ORGANIZATION>Corona Gold Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, for
each <ORGANIZATION>Stikine</ORGANIZATION> share. Stikine holders also would be eligible
subsequently to receive a special Corona Gold stock dividend.
   Analysts have had difficulty valuing <ORGANIZATION>Corona</ORGANIZATION>'s offer, which
is part of a broad corporate reorganization plan by Corona.
But <PERSON>Mr. Allan</PERSON> said the lock-up pact, which calls for the
exchange of 8.5 Corona Class A shares for each <ORGANIZATION>Stikine</ORGANIZATION> share,
under certain conditions, established a "down-side" benchmark
for <ORGANIZATION>Corona</ORGANIZATION>'s offer.
   Based on the <MONEY>C$7.375</MONEY> closing price of Corona Class A
shares yesterday on the <ORGANIZATION>Toronto Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>, the
"downside" value of <ORGANIZATION>Corona</ORGANIZATION>'s offer is about C$62.69 a <ORGANIZATION>Stikine</ORGANIZATION>
share.
   Corona already owns an interest in <LOCATION>Eskay Creek</LOCATION> through
<PERCENT>45%</PERCENT>-owned <ORGANIZATION>Prime Resources Group Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a Vancouver-based gold
exploration company. Prime owns <PERCENT>50%</PERCENT> of <LOCATION>Eskay Creek</LOCATION> and

   TORONTO -- Corona Corp. said it ended a previously
reported agreement to sell its industrial mineral assets to
60%-owned Avalon Corp. but continues to negotiate the sale to
Avalon of its 17% interest in Poco Petroleums Ltd.
   The Toronto-based gold-mining company said the agreement
with Avalon was ended after a minority partner in one of
Corona's mineral properties decided to oppose the sale. The
transaction had been conditional on Avalon obtaining 100%
ownership of the assets.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A <ORGANIZATION>Corona</ORGANIZATION> spokesman said he expects the sale of the <ORGANIZATION>Poco
Petroleums</ORGANIZATION> stake to be made at "close to market value,"
giving the transaction an indicated value of about <MONEY>51.6
million Canadian dollars</MONEY> (<MONEY>US$44.1 million</MONEY>).
   Avalon, an energy exploration and production concern based

<ORGANIZATION>Poco Petroleums</ORGANIZATION>.
   As reported, <ORGANIZATION>Poco Petroleums</ORGANIZATION> is negotiating a merger with

   <ORGANIZATION>Dome Petroleum Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> rejected an offer by <ORGANIZATION>Giant Yellowknife Mines Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> to purchase its <PERCENT>21.5%</PERCENT> stake in <ORGANIZATION>Dome Mines Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> for <MONEY>448.6 million Canadian dollars</MONEY> (<MONEY>$339 million</MONEY>). 

   <ORGANIZATION>Dome Petroleum</ORGANIZATION> declined to comment on its reasons for rejecting the offer, but said it would vote its shares in favor of a previously reported plan to merge <ORGANIZATION>Dome Mines</ORGANIZATION> with two other gold mining concerns. 
Giant <LOCATION>Yellowknife</LOCATION> had planned to vote against the merger if it acquired the shares. 

   Shareholders of <ORGANIZATION>Toronto-based Dome Mines</ORGANIZATION>, its <ORGANIZATION>Campbell Red Lake Mines Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> subsidiary and <LOCATION>Vancouver</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>British Columbia-based Placer Development Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> are scheduled to vote on the merger <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>. 
The combined concern would be <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION>'s biggest gold mining company. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Dome Mines</ORGANIZATION> said it is "pleased that (Dome Petroleum) is supportive" of the merger plan. 
Placer said it is "pleased that the amalgamation can proceed as planned." 

   Giant <LOCATION>Yellowknife</LOCATION>, a Toronto-based gold mining company, had offered <MONEY>21.50 Canadian dollars</MONEY> a share for the <ORGANIZATION>Dome Mines</ORGANIZATION> stake. 
<ORGANIZATION>Dome Mines</ORGANIZATION> closed <DATE>Friday</DATE> at <MONEY>21 dollars</MONEY>, down <MONEY>37.5 cents</MONEY>, in trading on the <ORGANIZATION>Toronto Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>. 

   Clifford Frame, chairman and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION>Giant Yellowknife</ORGANIZATION>, said he remains "convinced the merger is not in the interests of shareholders" of <ORGANIZATION>Dome Mines</ORGANIZATION>. 
He said <LOCATION>Placer</LOCATION> is a more "risk oriented" investment than <ORGANIZATION>Dome Mines</ORGANIZATION>, because much of its future gold production will come from mines in <LOCATION>Papua New Guinea</LOCATION>. 
All of <ORGANIZATION>Dome Mines</ORGANIZATION>' production is in <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>. 

   But <PERSON>Mr. Frame</PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION>Giant Yellowknife</ORGANIZATION> will drop plans to organize opposition to the merger and "wouldn't rule out" the possibility that <ORGANIZATION>Giant Yellowknife</ORGANIZATION> might seek to acquire a significant stake in the new company, if the merger plan goes through. 
He said <ORGANIZATION>Giant Yellowknife</ORGANIZATION>, whose offer would have been financed through a loan from a unit of its Australian parent, <ORGANIZATION>Ariadne Australia Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, will continue to seek "sizable acquisitions." 

   <ORGANIZATION>Dome Petroleum</ORGANIZATION>, as <ORGANIZATION>Dome Mines</ORGANIZATION>' largest holder, would wind up as the biggest shareholder in <ORGANIZATION>Placer Dome Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, as the amalgamated company would be named, with a stake of about <PERCENT>8%</PERCENT>.

<TEXT>
   <PERSON>John Kachmar</PERSON>, president and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION>Dickenson Mines Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, said the company expects to combine, through a share exchange, with <PERCENT>33%</PERCENT>-owned <ORGANIZATION>Wharf Resources Ltd</ORGANIZATION>. 

   Terms will be disclosed at a later date. 
Dickenson expects to complete the planned transaction within 60 to 90 days. 

   In trading yesterday on the <ORGANIZATION>Toronto Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Dickenson</PERSON> closed at <MONEY>7.75 Canadian dollars</MONEY> (<MONEY>$6.31</MONEY>) a share, down <MONEY>25 cents</MONEY>; <ORGANIZATION>Wharf</ORGANIZATION> was unchanged at <MONEY>6.125 dollars</MONEY> a share. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Kachmar</PERSON> said at the mining concern's annual meeting that the proposed transaction would create a gold-mining company with annual output of 135,000 ounces at a cash operating cost of <MONEY>$235</MONEY> an ounce. 
<PERSON>Dickenson</PERSON> has a <PERCENT>65%</PERCENT> stake in an underground mine at <LOCATION>Red Lake</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ontario</LOCATION>, from which it expects to produce 80,000 ounces of gold this year.

   CALGARY, Alberta -- Poco Petroleums Ltd. said it acquired
a 32% stake in Voyager Energy Inc. for 43 million Canadian
dollars (US$37.1 million) and said it intends to pursue a
second attempt to merge with Voyager.
   Poco acquired 32% of Voyager's common and a further 29% of
its common purchase warrants outstanding from CanCapital
Corp., an investment and merchant banking concern.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Combining Poco and Voyager would create one of the top 12
Canadian oil and gas production concerns, analysts said, and
one of the largest independent producers. Together, the two
companies would have an indicated market value of about
<MONEY>C$425.4 million</MONEY>. They also would have a production capacity
of <MONEY>150 million</MONEY> to 160 million feet of natural gas and 18,000
barrels of oil and liquids a day, Poco executives said.
   The first merger attempt was called off last year after
directors of the companies failed to reach agreement on
terms.
   "The current relative market and underlying values of the
companies should provide a basis for the successful
completion of a merger at this time," said <PERSON>Don Barkwell</PERSON>,
president of Poco. Voyager executives couldn't be reached for
comment.
   Vancouver-based <ORGANIZATION>Corona Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, which has a <PERCENT>47%</PERCENT> stake in
<LOCATION>Poco</LOCATION>, said it is pursuing plans to sell its Poco holdings to
reduce debt related to its <LOCATION>Eskay Creek</LOCATION> gold mining
operations. The proposed merger of Voyager and Poco "makes
the sale of the controlling block of Poco even more
attractive" to potential buyers, said <PERSON>Peter Steen</PERSON>, president
and chief executive of Corona. Corona executives said that
the sale process for its Poco interest is "well under way"
and that they hope to complete it "as soon as possible." They
declined to identify any potential buyers.
   In trading on the <ORGANIZATION>Toronto Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> yesterday, <ORGANIZATION>Poco
Petroleum</ORGANIZATION> closed at <MONEY>C$7.50</MONEY> a share, unchanged. Shares of
<ORGANIZATION>Voyager Energy</ORGANIZATION> closed at <MONEY>C$4.80</MONEY>, up <MONEY>45 Canadian cents</MONEY>.

   VANCOUVER, British Columbia -- Galactic Resources Ltd.
said it is considering acquiring DCC Equities Ltd., a
Toronto-based merchant bank, in a move that would give mining
financier Ned Goodman a major stake in Galactic.
   Terms of the transaction haven't been set, but the deal
likely will involve Galactic's issuing shares for "all or
substantially all" of the assets of DCC Equities, said Peter
Guest, president and chief executive officer of Galactic, a
gold mining concern based here.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Closely held <ORGANIZATION>DCC</ORGANIZATION> is <PERCENT>52%</PERCENT> owned by <ORGANIZATION>Dundee Capital Inc.</ORGANIZATION> of
<LOCATION>Toronto</LOCATION> with the rest held by a few institutions. Dundee, in
turn, is controlled by <PERSON>Mr. Goodman</PERSON>, its chairman and chief
executive, through direct shareholdings and through his
controlling stake in <ORGANIZATION>Corona Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, a Vancouver-based gold
producer.
   "I believe he'll be a very good partner," <PERSON>Mr. Guest</PERSON> said
of <PERSON>Mr. Goodman</PERSON>, adding that Galactic's current management
would remain in place. "We needed to do something to really
get the company jump-started during these hard times."
   Low gold prices have sent Galactic seeking cash for
operations from outside sources. The company hit a snag in
its attempt to raise <MONEY>$10 million</MONEY> through a private placement
of shares, but <PERSON>Mr. Guest</PERSON> said he expects to complete the
offering in coming weeks.
   Although a share-exchange ratio hasn't been set, it
appears that <ORGANIZATION>DCC</ORGANIZATION> shareholders would hold a significant
portion of Galactic's share capital following the proposed
acquisition. With 46.9 million shares outstanding, <ORGANIZATION>Galactic</ORGANIZATION>
has a market capitalization of about <MONEY>$41 million</MONEY>, based on
yesterday's unchanged closing share price on the <ORGANIZATION>American
Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> of <MONEY>87.5 cents</MONEY>.
   <ORGANIZATION>DCC</ORGANIZATION> holds equity investments with a current market value
of <MONEY>140 million Canadian dollars</MONEY> (<MONEY>US$122.3 milion</MONEY>), the
company said.

   VANCOUVER, British Columbia -- Placer Dome Inc. said it
backed out of a plan to jointly develop a rich British
Columbia gold deposit, leaving debt-burdened International
Corona to seek other means of raising the 210 million
Canadian dollars (US$183.8 million) needed to finance the
project.
   Fears that Corona could be stuck with all of the bill for
Eskay Creek hurt the company's share price. Yesterday, in
trading on the American Stock Exchange, the shares closed at
$4.625, down 37.5 cents. Placer Dome shares closed in
composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange at $10.50,
off 50 cents.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Corona, which already has invested about <MONEY>C$300 million</MONEY> in
<LOCATION>Eskay Creek</LOCATION>, has total debt of about <MONEY>C$380 million</MONEY>.
   But <PERSON>Peter Steen</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Corona</ORGANIZATION>'s president and chief executive
officer, said, "I don't think we'll have any trouble
financing the project." He said that currently the company is
talking with two other gold-mining concerns about putting
money into <LOCATION>Eskay Creek</LOCATION>, which is expected to begin production
in early <DATE>1994</DATE>. Corona also will seek bank financing after
completing an economic-feasibility study next year, he said.
   Exploration so far has outlined an estimated three million
ounces of gold at <LOCATION>Eskay Creek</LOCATION>, valued at about <MONEY>$1.08 billion</MONEY>
at current market prices. Production costs are projected to
be less than <MONEY>$150</MONEY> an ounce, one of the lowest cost structures
in the industry.
   Placer Dome agreed that the deposit could become a
profitable gold mine. However, the company said it objected
to the proposed joint-venture agreement, which would have
saddled <LOCATION>Placer</LOCATION> with repaying all the capital costs while
receiving just <PERCENT>50%</PERCENT> of the mine's cash flow. Placer spokesman
<PERSON>Hugh Leggatt</PERSON> said the company estimated that it wouldn't
begin to see a profit from the mine until after six years.
The mine is expected to have a relatively short lifespan of
eight years.
   Under the now-defunct plan, cash-rich <LOCATION>Placer</LOCATION> had agreed to
build the mine in exchange for increasing its stake in the
deposit to <PERCENT>50%</PERCENT> from the current <PERCENT>22%</PERCENT>. Corona's interest would
have dropped to about <PERCENT>25%</PERCENT> from <PERCENT>45%</PERCENT>.
   But <ORGANIZATION>Corona</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Mr. Steen</PERSON> estimated the mine's capital costs
could be repaid in two years using <PERCENT>100%</PERCENT> of the cash flow. He
forecast that the mine would produce 250,000 ounces of gold a
year, ranking it among the 10 biggest gold mines in <LOCATION>North
America</LOCATION>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Placer Dome</ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON>Corona</PERSON> has the right for the next 90 days
to buy <LOCATION>Placer</LOCATION>'s stake in <LOCATION>Eskay Creek</LOCATION> for <MONEY>C$105 million</MONEY>.
Failing that, <LOCATION>Placer</LOCATION> said it could swap its <LOCATION>Eskay Creek</LOCATION>
interest for shares in <LOCATION>Corona</LOCATION> or sell it to another party. A
<ORGANIZATION>Corona</ORGANIZATION> spokesman said it's unlikely Corona would buy <LOCATION>Placer</LOCATION>'s
holding at that price.
