<HEAD>Britain Says Falklands Exercise Not Intended To Provoke Argentina</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The government says a weeklong military exercise
in the <LOCATION>Falkland Islands</LOCATION> set to begin <DATE>Monday</DATE> is not intended to
provoke <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>, noting that fewer than 1,000 troops are to take
part.
   <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>, which claims the islands it calls <LOCATION>Malvinas</LOCATION>, lost a
74-day war with <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> for their possession in <DATE>1982</DATE> and still has
not formally declared an end to hostilities in the <LOCATION>South Atlantic</LOCATION>.
   A communique <DATE>Thursday</DATE> from <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>'s Foreign Affairs and
<ORGANIZATION>Defense Ministries</ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> has adopted plans for ``vigilance
and defensive alert'' during the British exercise and, if
necessary, ``will execute corresponding defense plans.'' It did not
elaborate.
   <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Minister of State</ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION>Armed Forces</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Ian Stewart</PERSON>,
told the <ORGANIZATION>House of Commons</ORGANIZATION> <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> that fewer than 1,000
troops and only a small number of aircraft would take part in the
exercise, code-named Fire Focus.
   <PERSON>Stewart</PERSON> said the exercise involves an airlift and is part of a
defensive strategy to keep a minimum of troops in the islands about
400 miles east of the southern Argentine coast.
   The <ORGANIZATION>British Defense Ministry</ORGANIZATION> announced last <DATE>June</DATE> that it was
reducing the strength of its Falklands garrison, but refused to
disclose the size of the cut. Published reports at the time said
the move would cut the garrison then consisting of more than 2,500
troops by about 400.
   Britain completed an international airport at <LOCATION>Mount Pleasant</LOCATION>
near the Falklands capital of <ORGANIZATION>Stanley</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>June 1985</DATE>. The airport can
take wide-bodied military jets, enabling <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> to fly in
reinforcements at short notice if necessary.
   <PERSON>Stewart</PERSON> said the development of contingency plans for a massive
airlift had enabled <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> to halve the size of the garrison.
   He gave no figures for the present strength of the costly
garrison but added: ``Such a substantial reduction of the military
presence ... serves to confirm that our purpose is entirely
defensive.''
   A <ORGANIZATION>Defense Ministry</ORGANIZATION> spokesman, who in accordance with British
practice declined to be named, said later: ``We are not intending
to increase the tension down there ... There is nothing significant
about the timing of it (the exercise). It is not meant in any way
to be provocative to <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>.''
   A <ORGANIZATION>Foreign Office</ORGANIZATION> spokesman said <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> recently notified
<LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> through Swiss diplomatic channels that the exercise was
purely one of reinforcement.
   Diplomatic ties between <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>, cut during the
<DATE>1982</DATE> war, remain severed.

   <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> wants <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> to make major troop
reductions in the <LOCATION>Falkland Islands</LOCATION> as part of an agreement to
normalize relations, <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON>Eduardo Menem</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>
said <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
   Menem, brother of President <PERSON>Carlos Menem</PERSON>, also told a news
conference he believes negotiations in <LOCATION>Madrid</LOCATION> next month will lead
<LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> to restore diplomatic relations.
   Diplomatic ties were severed during the <DATE>1982</DATE> Falkland Islands
war, when <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> drove Argentine invaders from the <LOCATION>South Atlantic</LOCATION>
archipelago.
   ``Demilitarization means only one thing,'' <PERSON>Menem</PERSON> said. ``Of
course, it is a reduction of forces in the area. I think there is a
consensus for making the <LOCATION>South Atlantic</LOCATION> an area of peace.'
   Menem was in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> for a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION>Inter-Parliamentary
Union</ORGANIZATION>, a 108-nation conference of legislators. He shook hands and
chatted with <PERSON>Queen Elizabeth II</PERSON> on <DATE>Monday</DATE> when she opened the
meeting.
   Since taking office <DATE>two months ago</DATE>, his brother has initiated
peace overtures toward <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>, including ending an economic embargo
this week.
   <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> maintains a military garrison in the islands, as well as
fighter aircraft and Rapier missiles, to guard the 1,600 British
inhabitants.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Defense Ministry</ORGANIZATION> refused <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> to give the current strength
of the garrison. British newspapers say it is down to about 1,000
troops, about one-fourth the earlier size, because <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> is
confident <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> will not attack again.
   The <LOCATION>Madrid</LOCATION> talks are expected to focus on fishing rights and
restoring air links between <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> and the islands.
   Many observers believe <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> wants to patch up the
differences because <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> is a key member of the <ORGANIZATION>European Economic
Community</ORGANIZATION>. The 12-nation community is due to drop remaining trade
barriers and become a single market in <DATE>1992</DATE>.
   Senator <PERSON>Menen</PERSON> said <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> ``never put economic considerations
in the forefront in our consideration of this subject.'' He added,
``But if through this we manage to establish good commercial
relations, then be it welcome.''

   Argentina Revives $1.4 Billion Accord
   With IMF and Sets Talks With Banks

   WASHINGTON -- Argentina, striving to repair relations with
its foreign creditors, has revived a $1.4 billion loan
agreement with the International Monetary Fund and will begin
negotiations Thursday on resuming payments to its main
commercial bank creditors.
   Late Friday, the IMF's executive board cleared a $240
million loan to Argentina, after the board had approved
revised targets for an economic program originally agreed to
in November 1989. Argentina can draw the $240 million
immediately; it previously had drawn another $240 million of
the $1.4 billion credit. The IMF had held up further
disbursements until Argentina had set revised targets for
such important economic indicators as inflation and the size
of the government deficit.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Latin American country has succeeded in reviving its
agreement with the <ORGANIZATION>IMF</ORGANIZATION> after two months of much-improved
management under Economy Minister <PERSON>Erman Gonzalez</PERSON>. Inflation
has moderated, and the government even seems to be balancing
its budget.
   The renewed <ORGANIZATION>IMF</ORGANIZATION> agreement will, for the first time, allow
<LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> to set aside <PERCENT>25%</PERCENT> of what remains of the <MONEY>$1.4
billion</MONEY> credit to allow it to pursue plans to reduce its bank
debt. Faced with a total of about <MONEY>$60 billion</MONEY> of foreign debt
-- with more than half of that owed to commercial banks,
Argentine officials are eager to try such strategies.
   <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>'s leading commercial bank creditors struggled
hard -- but failed -- to ensure that the country made an
interest payment to them before it could restore its
relations with the <ORGANIZATION>IMF</ORGANIZATION>. They also had hoped to extract an
interest payment from the Argentines as the price of resuming
talks on <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>'s approximately <MONEY>$30.5 billion</MONEY> of medium-
and long-term foreign bank debt. But that strategy also
didn't succeed.
   Nevertheless, the banks remain hopeful that they will
receive a payment around the time the talks start in <LOCATION>New
York</LOCATION>. "I think that they'll make a payment when we start
talking," said a senior <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> banker. <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> is as much as
<MONEY>$6 billion</MONEY> in arrears on interest payments to banks, having
not paid interest to them for as much as two years. It is
struggling to restructure its economy, and is reluctant to
make payments to banks from its estimated <MONEY>$1 billion</MONEY> of
foreign-exchange reserves.
   In a statement released in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, <PERSON>William Rhodes</PERSON>, the
<ORGANIZATION>Citicorp</ORGANIZATION> executive who heads the 13-bank committee that
negotiates with <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>, and <PERSON>Javier Gonzalez Fraga</PERSON>, the
vice president of the Argentine central bank, said they had
agreed to resume negotiations. <PERSON>Mr. Rhodes</PERSON> said they will
discuss "the resumption of a regular flow of payments by
<LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> to commercial bank creditors" on the country's
medium-term and long-term public-sector debt.
   <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>'s progress with its foreign creditors contrasts
with <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>, which has yet to reach agreement with the <ORGANIZATION>IMF</ORGANIZATION>
and reopen talks with foreign bank creditors. <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>, which
now has interest payment arrears to its commercial banks that
amount to about <MONEY>$5 billion</MONEY>, seems to be preoccupied with
trying to improve the enactment of its economic plan.
   Its economy minister, <PERSON>Zelia Cardoso de Mello</PERSON>, visited
senior bankers in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> recently. They seemed
disappointed. "She's not doing much in the way of listening,"
said one. With reserves of as much as <MONEY>$8 billion</MONEY>, the bankers
reckon that <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> could start to clean up its payments
arrears before they become unmanageably large.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> began a 25-day military exercise <DATE>Monday</DATE> to
test its ability to protect the <LOCATION>Falkland Islands</LOCATION> from invasion, the
<ORGANIZATION>Defense Ministry</ORGANIZATION> reported. <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> said its forces would be on
``defensive alert.''
   ``At this stage, it's very much a paper exercise,'' a ministry
spokesman said. ``The exercise will start with intelligence reports
that an enemy is raising the threat level. They will play out a
scenario.''
   An infantry batallion of 600-1,000 soldiers based in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>
will fly to the <LOCATION>South Atlantic</LOCATION> archipelago <DATE>March 17-18</DATE>, the
spokesman said on condition of anonymity.
   <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> claims the islands off its coast, which it calls the
<LOCATION>Malvinas</LOCATION>, and invaded them in <DATE>April 1982</DATE>. <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> sent a naval task
force and won a 74-day war that killed 712 Argentines and 258
Britons.
   <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> says the exercise, called Fire Focus, is purely
defensive. One of its functions will be to test a new <MONEY>$690 million</MONEY>
airport built since the war.
   <PERSON>Ian Stewart</PERSON>, the armed forces minister, said criticism of the
exercise from <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> and other Latin American nations resulted
from misunderstanding of its size.
   ``I do not see how something which is purely a defensive
exercise can be seen as provocative,'' he said.
   ``We have to defend the <LOCATION>Falklands</LOCATION>. We had a very unfortunate
experience six years ago. We not only have a right to have a
defensive garrison in the <LOCATION>Falklands</LOCATION>, we have a responsibility to do
so.''
   The exercise, scheduled to end <DATE>March 31</DATE>, is the largest since
the war and the first with reinforcements flown from <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>.
Military units could not be airlifted in <DATE>1982</DATE> because the airport
was inadequate, and the naval force took weeks to reach the islands.
   <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> says the islands are part of its inheritance from
Spanish colonial rule and claims <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> stole them in <DATE>1833</DATE>.
   <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> has refused to discuss sovereignty, declaring that the
1,900 Falkland Islanders prefer to remain British, but <PERSON>Stewart</PERSON>
said: ``In other respects we would like to have more normal
relations with <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>.''

<TEXT>
<LOCATION>ARGENTINA</LOCATION> wants to attract thousands of migrants from the former <LOCATION>Soviet
Union</LOCATION> to populate the country's vast interior. Officials even hope that the
migrants will bring <MONEY>millions of dollars</MONEY> in investment capital with them.
'We are considering immigrants who would bring capital to dynamise the
economy. We are talking with the <ORGANIZATION>European Community</ORGANIZATION> to provide credits for
potential migrants to settle and create companies in <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>,' said <PERSON>Mr
Geraldo Molnes</PERSON>, the interior ministry's population secretary.
<LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> is the second Latin American country to offer to take such
migrants. <LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION> said at the <DATE>weekend</DATE> it was seeking some with scientific
and technical skills.
<LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> covers an area the size of <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> but a third of the population is
in <LOCATION>Buenos Aires</LOCATION>, leaving most of <LOCATION>Patagonia</LOCATION> - the far south - sparsely
inhabited.
Populating <LOCATION>Patagonia</LOCATION> has obssessed Argentine officialdom since it took
control of the region early in <DATE>this century</DATE>, but the comforts of city life
in <LOCATION>Buenos Aires</LOCATION> have been generally preferred to the distant steppes. <PERSON>Mr
Molnes</PERSON> hopes any newcomers will go to <LOCATION>Patagonia</LOCATION> and to small cities in the
interior.
The government hopes immigrants will begin arriving at a rate of 20,000 a
year and quickly reach 100,000 a year. <PERSON>Mr Molnes</PERSON> denied that <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> was
discriminating against dark-skinned immigrants from nearby countries in
favour of Europeans.
An <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> diplomat, though, poured cold water on the notion: 'They have not made
a formal approach yet. In any case, some of us do not trust the Argentines,
who give the impression of just wanting the money. Others, especially the
Germans, say it amounts to trade in human lives. It could be done
tastefully, but I doubt anything will come of it.'

<TEXT>
The <ORGANIZATION>World Bank</ORGANIZATION> board yesterday approved a loan of Dollars 508.5m (Pounds
348.2m) for an innovative project to develop <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>'s capital markets.
The Washington-based development institution agreed to lend Dollars 500m for
a 'backstop' facility that will guarantee <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>'s commercial banks a
source of liquidity if interest rates rise in the future, and will thus
encourage them to lend money for longer periods to small and medium-sized
businesses.
The backstop fund will be owned by the Argentine government and managed by
an internationally recognised financial institution. It will undertake to
buy bonds from the commercial banks if interest rates rise beyond a fixed
level, to allow them to refinance loans made for periods longer than six
years.
The hope is that the facility will help strengthen the balance sheets of the
top 15 or 20 Argentine banks if interest rates turn upwards.
<LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> is one of the <ORGANIZATION>World Bank</ORGANIZATION>'s biggest borrowers, with loans totalling
Dollars 3.6bn since the current government took office in <DATE>1989</DATE>.

<TEXT>
   An <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION> businessman charged
with trying to steal a 37-ton meteorite from a small Argentine town
left for home <DATE>Friday</DATE> after a judge ordered a 90-day postponement of
his trial.
   ``I've got my passport, and I'm out of here,'' <PERSON>Robert Haag</PERSON>, 33,
of <LOCATION>Tucson</LOCATION>, said in a telephone interview a few hours before
departure.
   ``I'm supposed to come back in 90 days,'' said <PERSON>Haag</PERSON>, also known
as the Meteorite Man. ``I'd like to come back and clear myself, but
I just don't know. Right now all I want to do is get back to my
business'' of selling meteorites.
   <PERSON>Haag</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Tucson</LOCATION> photographer <PERSON>Jeffrey Smith</PERSON>, 31, and <PERSON>Miguel
Fernandez</PERSON>, an Argentine, were arrested <DATE>Jan. 21</DATE> when they were
stopped by police near the small town of <LOCATION>Gancedo</LOCATION>, in <LOCATION>Chaco
Province</LOCATION>, 620 miles northwest of <ORGANIZATION>Buenos Aires</ORGANIZATION>.
   The three defendants were charged in the neighboring town of
Charata with the theft of the meteorite, roughly the size of a
small automobile, that police said they found in the back of a
tractor-trailer the men were driving.
   The meteorite, found in the <DATE>1960s</DATE>, reputedly is one of the
world's four largest. Charges against <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> were dropped and he
returned to <LOCATION>Tucson</LOCATION>.
   The area is rich in meteorites, and several years ago provincial
lawmakers made all meteorites provincial property and forbade their
unauthorized sale.
   Haag was released on <MONEY>$20,000</MONEY> bond but was forbidden to leave
<LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>.
   Fernandez, unable to post <MONEY>$8,600</MONEY> bond, remains in custody in
<LOCATION>Charata</LOCATION>.
   Haag claimed he planned to purchase the meteorite in a deal
arranged by <PERSON>Fernandez</PERSON> with the owner of the land on which the
object had been found.
   But he expressed no regrets <DATE>Friday</DATE> over the outcome of the
expedition.
   ``This has been a super adventure,'' he said. ``I met a lot of
people in the <LOCATION>Chaco</LOCATION>, and at the end all kinds of them were trying
to sell me meteorites.''
   <PERSON>Haag</PERSON>'s case was being heard in Charata by <PERSON>Judge Juan Carlos
Clauter</PERSON>. The judge postponed the trial and returned <PERSON>Haag</PERSON>'s passport
on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> after <PERSON>Haag</PERSON> said he needed to return home to take care
of business.
   ``I'm losing at least <MONEY>$2,000</MONEY> a day by being here,'' said <PERSON>Haag</PERSON>,
who claims to do ``half a <MONEY>million dollars</MONEY> of business a year''
selling meteorites to private collectors, schools and museums.
   <PERSON>Haag</PERSON>, known to mineral enthusiasts back home as the Meteorite
Man, said he planned to sell the meteorite he is accused of trying
to steal. ``I could have gotten a <MONEY>million dollars</MONEY> for it,'' he said.
   If convicted, <PERSON>Haag</PERSON> could be sentenced to from 30 days to two
years in jail. If he fails to return when his trial resumes <DATE>May 13</DATE>,
he would forfeit his bail.
   Meteorites are common in the <LOCATION>Chaco</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Haag</PERSON> said, ``because a long
time ago a giant asteroid broke into millions of pieces, showering
the area with fragments, some the size of marbles and basketballs,
others weighing a ton or more.''
   The value of meteorites ``depends on the kind of material they
contain,'' he said. ``Some are fragments of the moon, others are
the heads of comets.''
   ``But I'm through dealing with meteorites in <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>,'' <PERSON>Haag</PERSON>
added. ``The last thing I want to do is to try to get anything out
of here.''

   WASHINGTON -- The International Monetary Fund approved a
$1.04 billion standby credit to Argentina to support the

   At the request of the Argentine government, 25% of the IMF
funding will be set aside for debt reduction, the IMF said in
a statement.

<TEXT>
   <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>'s economic program is aimed at fostering
economic growth, rapidly reducing inflation and maintaining

   In fighting the country's periodic bouts of inflation,
Argentine authorities have frozen public-sector tariffs,
salaries and pensions, which led to a sharp decline in
inflation and interest rates in the <DATE>second quarter</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>IMF</ORGANIZATION>
said.
   <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>'s economic program, supported by the standby
credit, also seeks to improve tax administration, reduce
staffing levels in the government, open up the economy to
international trade and further privatize public enterprises.
   The largest of these enterprises is the state oil company,
which is being trimmed in size for eventual privatization.
Price controls on petroleum products were eliminated in
<DATE>January</DATE> and parts of the company's operations have already
been sold.
   <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> hopes to reschedule its official debt and to
normalize relations with commercial bank creditors, the <ORGANIZATION>IMF</ORGANIZATION>
said.
   Separately, the <ORGANIZATION>IMF</ORGANIZATION> agreed to provide <LOCATION>Tanzania</LOCATION> with <MONEY>$242
million</MONEY> to support its economic program through <DATE>June 1994</DATE>.
The program is aimed at fostering an average annual growth
rate of at least <PERCENT>4%</PERCENT>, while further reducing inflation.
<LOCATION>Tanzania</LOCATION> has been successful at working toward those goals
the past three years, the <ORGANIZATION>IMF</ORGANIZATION> said.
   <LOCATION>Tanzania</LOCATION> also is seeking to open up its financial-services
sector to private investors, both domestic and foreign, and
to revamp its public financial institutions, the <ORGANIZATION>IMF</ORGANIZATION> said.
   The <ORGANIZATION>IMF</ORGANIZATION> money will be disbursed over three years, with
about <MONEY>$70.7 million</MONEY> available the first year in two
installments.

FORD'S Canadian subsidiary is reportedly close to a deal to export as many
as 125,000 cars to <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> over the next two years from a plant in
<LOCATION>Ontario</LOCATION>.
The Canadian media reported yesterday that financing is still required for
the sale, which would be worth more than USDollars 1bn. A <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> spokesman
said that 'it's not quite a done deal from our end, but we are extremely
hopeful that the financing will soon be in place'.
The mid-sized <ORGANIZATION>Ford Tempos</ORGANIZATION> would be used as taxis in <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>. Phoenix Plus,
a <LOCATION>Toronto</LOCATION> company which is brokering the sale, would buy the cars from <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION>
and sell them through an association of Argentine taxi owners to individual
operators.
<PERSON>Mr Howard Wolle</PERSON>, president of <LOCATION>Phoenix</LOCATION> Plus, said the company is close to
securing loan guarantees from the national bank of <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>.
If the deal goes through, 65,000 cars would be shipped this year, with the
possibility of another 60,000 in <DATE>1993</DATE>. The order represents about 25 per
cent of the capacity of the <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> plant in <LOCATION>Oakville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Toronto</LOCATION>.

   The Argentine central bank said it will continue investigating the six banks it closed, in the largest action taken by the state banking authority since President <PERSON>Raul Alfonsin</PERSON> was elected in <DATE>1983</DATE>, and will attempt to have them acquired by other financial institutions. 

   The central bank said the six banks were closed <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> because of "the serious deterioration of their solvency and liquidity" and "fraudulent administration." 
The closings were expected because the banks had been under investigations since as long ago as <DATE>December 1984</DATE>. 

   The biggest of the closed banks is <ORGANIZATION>Banco del Oeste</ORGANIZATION>, the 16th-largest institution in the country. 
The bank has 54 branch offices nationwide, and its deposits a year ago totaled <MONEY>$55 million</MONEY>. 
The other banks closed were <ORGANIZATION>Banco del Argense</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Banco de Credito Rural Argentino</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Banco del Iguazu</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>San Miguel Cooperativo Limitado</LOCATION> and Libertadores Cooperativo Limitado. 
They range in size from the 38th-largest to the 155th-largest in the country, though the size of their deposits wasn't immediately known. 

   Holders of accounts at the closed banks were told to go to the central bank to make claims for withdrawals, which are guaranteed by law. 

   Acquiring banks must try to assure the jobs of the closed banks' employees, the central bank said. 
But the uncertainty surrounding that situation caused the 2,400 employees affected by the closings to refuse to leave the banks yesterday.

   Prime Minister <PERSON>Margaret Thatcher</PERSON> called <DATE>Friday</DATE> for
improved commercial and diplomatic relations with <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>, but
she also insisted <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> retain control of the disputed <LOCATION>Falkland
Islands</LOCATION>.
   In a Christmas address to the 1,800 islanders, <PERSON>Mrs. Thatcher</PERSON>
said <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>, in recent talks with the new Argentine government,
had not wavered from its position that control of the <LOCATION>South
Atlantic</LOCATION> islands is not negotiable.
   Her message followed the restoration <DATE>Thursday</DATE> of consular ties
between <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>, severed at the time of the <DATE>1982</DATE>
Falklands War.
   Consular flags were hoisted <DATE>Friday</DATE> in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Buenos Aires</PERSON>,
but full diplomatic links between the two countries remain severed.
   In the speech broadcast by the <ORGANIZATION>British Broadcasting Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Mrs.
Thatcher</PERSON> said <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> would uphold its commitments to residents of
the <LOCATION>Falklands</LOCATION>.
   Argentine troops invaded the British colony off southern
<LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> in <DATE>1982</DATE>. Britain sent troops and drove out the invaders
in a 74-day war.
   <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> has claimed sovereignty to the islands it calls the
<LOCATION>Malvinas</LOCATION> since <DATE>1832</DATE>.
   The prime minister commended the Falklands' growing prosperity
from its fishing industry and independence.
   ``You're deciding the kind of life you want for yourselves and
your children, and you're taking a greater share of responsibility
for your own affairs,'' <PERSON>Mrs. Thatcher</PERSON> said in the message,
broadcast on the <ORGANIZATION>BBC</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>World Service</ORGANIZATION> ``Calling the Falklands''

   Argentine merchant ships now may
sail near the <LOCATION>Falkland Islands</LOCATION> for the first time since <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>
lost its <DATE>1982</DATE> battle with <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> for the <LOCATION>South Atlantic</LOCATION>
archipelago, the <ORGANIZATION>Foreign Ministry</ORGANIZATION> announced <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
   Britain modified the 150-mile ``protection zone'' it has
enforced since regaining the islands in a 74-day war.
   Argentine merchant ships may travel within the area from 150
miles out to 12 miles, the territorial limit enforced by <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>.
To sail into the 12-mile limit, British permission is needed.
   The vessels may not fish in the zone without permission.
   Argentine military ships must still request and receive British
permission before entering the zone.
   The new arrangement, which took effect <DATE>Jan. 1</DATE>, was agreed to
last <DATE>October</DATE> at British-Argentine talks in <LOCATION>Madrid</LOCATION>.
   The two countries resumed consular relations last month for the
first time since <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> invaded the windswept territory it has
claimed since <DATE>1810</DATE> and which it calls the <LOCATION>Malvinas</LOCATION>. Talks are to
resume in <LOCATION>Madrid</LOCATION> <DATE>Feb. 14-15</DATE> after which full diplomatic relations
may be restored.
   The issue of sovereignty has been set aside, but <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> has
refused to give up its claim to the territory.
   The Falklands are home to 1,800 islanders.
   ``The <ORGANIZATION>United Kingdom</ORGANIZATION> lifted yesterday the restriction on the
navigation of Argentine merchant ships in the 150-mile military
zone,'' Foreign Minister <PERSON>Domingo Cavallo</PERSON> told reporters.
   ``<LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> has the firm intention of recovering its sovereignty

<HEAD>British Troops Take Off In Practice Airlift For Falklands</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRIZE NORTON, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of British troops took off
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> on an 8,000-mile practice airlift to reinforce the
remote <LOCATION>Falklands Islands</LOCATION> garrison in the <LOCATION>South Atlantic</LOCATION>.
   The first of up to 10 transport planes carrying 900 troops
departed at about <TIME>10 p.m.</TIME> from <ORGANIZATION>Brize Norton Royal Air Force</ORGANIZATION> base,
60 miles northwest of <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, said a <ORGANIZATION>Defense Ministry</ORGANIZATION> spokesman,
who was not identified in keeping with British custom.
   It was part of <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s controversial Fire Focus military
exercise, which marks <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s first major drill in the <LOCATION>Falklands</LOCATION>
since it won a <DATE>1982</DATE> war with <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> over the islands. The 25-day
exercise began <DATE>March 7</DATE>.
   Phantom fighter jets and other planes will fly in from other
British bases, <ORGANIZATION>Royal Air Force</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>Michael Hill</PERSON> said.
   <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>, backed by other Latin American nations, has called
the <MONEY>$690 million</MONEY> troop movement ``aggravating.'' <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> insisted
it is defensive.
   In the <LOCATION>Falklands</LOCATION>, Gen. <PERSON>Neil Carlier</PERSON> told reporters at <LOCATION>Mount
Pleasant</LOCATION> airport ``it is much cheaper to mount an exercise like
this than to hold a vast number of people down here at taxpayers'
expense which might also, perhaps, send out the wrong signals.''
   <PERSON>Carlier</PERSON> called the nature of the exercise misunderstood and said
the airlift was needed because ``we've just set up in a new base
and not yet had the opportunity to prove the system for having
reinforcements.''
   The 2,000 troops stationed on the <LOCATION>South Atlantic</LOCATION> archipelago
were placed in a state of high readiness to prepare for the arrival
of the reinforcements <DATE>Thursday</DATE> and <DATE>Friday</DATE>, he said.
   The reinforcements will include troops taking the role of the
enemy. Advance personnel, equipment and reporters arrived <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
   Britain built the airport after the <DATE>1982</DATE> war to accommodate
wide-bodied jets which could be used to rush troops there in the
event of a build-up of tension in the region.
   In <DATE>1982</DATE>, Argentine forces invaded the islands. Lack of a
suitable runway forced <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> to form a naval task force that took
weeks to reach the islands.
   Britain recaptured the colony after a 74-day conflict which
killed 712 Argentines, 255 Britons and three <LOCATION>Falkland Islands</LOCATION>
civilians.
   <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>, 200 miles west of the islands, claims it inherited
the Falklands from Spanish colonial days and that they were stolen
by <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>, which has ruled them as a colony since <DATE>1833</DATE>.
   The 1,900 islanders, most of British descent, say they prefer
British rule.
   This month, the <ORGANIZATION>Organization of American States</ORGANIZATION> voted 25-0 to
urge <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> to reconsider the exercise. The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>St.
Lucia</LOCATION>, a former British colony, abstained.

   Prime Minister <PERSON>Margaret Thatcher</PERSON> said <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> that
<LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s current military exercise to reinforce the <LOCATION>Falkland
Islands</LOCATION> against possible attack by <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> was ``no one else's
business.''
   Flatly rejecting protests by <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> and other Latin American
countries, <PERSON>Mrs. Thatcher</PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION>House of Commons</ORGANIZATION> that <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> had
a right and also ``a duty to see that reinforcement proposals could
in fact be carried out.''
   ``It is no one else's business except the defense of people's
rights in the <LOCATION>Falkland Islands</LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON>Mrs. Thatcher</PERSON>.
   About 900 troops will travel 8,000 miles next week to the
<LOCATION>Falkland Islands</LOCATION> from <PERSON>Brize Norton</PERSON> air base, north of <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, as
part of the exercise, called Fire Focus.
   The exercise began this week with mythical ``intelligence
reports'' warning that <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> was preparing again to invade the
south <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> archipelago which it has long claimed. The 1,800
British-descended islanders fiercely reject Argentine rule.
   Fire Focus is the first major maneuver announced by <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>
since it recaptured the islands from invading Argentine troops in a
74-day war in <DATE>1982</DATE>.
   <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> has said it gave notice last month to <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> of the
intended exercise and has since announced that Fire Focus will
involve fewer than 1,000 men.
   <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> maintains a garrison, reportedly of about 2,000 men, on
the islands and says it must practice sending in reinforcements in
order to avoid keeping more troops there permanently.
   Briefing reporters at <PERSON>Brize Norton</PERSON> on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, Foreign Office
Assistant Under Secretary <PERSON>Robin Fearn</PERSON> said Fire Focus ``threatens
no one. It is entirely defensive.''
   ``Far from being a cause for concern, it is an integral part of
our policy of reducing tension,'' he added.
   He said the initial post-war garrison had been halved in recent
years after the completion of a new runway at the Falklands
capital, <LOCATION>Port Stanley</LOCATION>, which can take wide-bodied jets.

FT  27 MAY 93 / Survey of Argentina (6): Uncertainty over pensions -
Financial market reform is one of the government's frustrations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FINANCIAL market reform must rank among the government's great frustrations.
Despite <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>'s dramatic economic recovery, officials complain that few
private banks have made sufficient progress in modernisation.
And to the government's undisguised concern, bankers have responded to
deregulation by financing a consumer boom. The equity market has failed to
recover from a speculative binge last year.
The principal uncertainty hanging over financial markets is the shape of the
future pension system, which the government hopes will become a cornerstone
of a modern capital market. But pension reform has run into heavy opposition
in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>.
Politicians have already rejected the plan of economy minister <PERSON>Domingo
Cavallo</PERSON> to force all employees to pay <MONEY>11 per cent</MONEY> of their income into
individual retirement savings accounts, which would be administered by fund
managers.
Instead, <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> has made contribution to private pension schemes
voluntary. It has also ordered the government-owned <ORGANIZATION>Banco de la Nacion
Argentina</ORGANIZATION> (BNA) to provide contributors to its pension funds with a minimum
dollar-based guaranteed return.
<PERSON>Mr Cavallo</PERSON> maintains that these are only superficial changes, which do not
affect the heart of pension reform. He is confident that most people will
prefer private pension funds, which he believes will offer higher returns
and will be seen as less risky than the <ORGANIZATION>BNA</ORGANIZATION>'s government-guaranteed fund.
Bankers nevertheless worry that <ORGANIZATION>BNA</ORGANIZATION>'s guaranteed return could not only
hamper private sector competition but would also fail to lighten the burden
of the government's existing pension liabilities. They also wonder how the
government can guarantee millions of <ORGANIZATION>BNA</ORGANIZATION> clients guaranteed dollar incomes,
irrespective of the risk of a devaluation.
Question marks must also remain over the wider issue of how much and how
quickly the pension system can boost <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>'s savings rate and reduce its
reliance on imported capital. <PERSON>Mr Roque Fernandez</PERSON>, central bank president,
commented that pension funds 'will not bring a phenomenal change. I hope it
comes, but I think it will be gradual.'
Meanwhile, the equity market, which will one of the principal beneficiaries
of a reformed pension system, is in the doldrums. Share prices have been
unable to recover from a disastrous price slide that began last <DATE>June</DATE>. The
Merval market index now stands at less than half its <DATE>May 1992</DATE> high of 882.
The decline has continued this year, spurred by a huge overhang of
overpriced shares still held by investors. Share prices dipped sharply in
<DATE>April</DATE> and <DATE>May</DATE> in anticipation of <DATE>July</DATE>'s planned privatisation of <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>'s
largest company, the national oil corporation <ORGANIZATION>YPF</ORGANIZATION>. Uncertainty over
President <PERSON>Menem</PERSON>'s re-election bid has also dampened enthusiasm. However,
Argentine stocks are still not cheap, with price/earnings ratios averaging
about 18.
Market capitalisation of USDollars 18bn is equivalent to only 8 per cent of
GDP, a low ratio even by regional standards. Daily turnover rarely exceeds
Dollars 30m, and the market continues to be gripped by a strong speculative
mentality.
Investors are deterred by a narrow market in which liquidity is a problem in
all but a few actively traded stocks. Three companies - two privatised
telephone stocks and the <ORGANIZATION>Perez Companc</ORGANIZATION> holding company - account for half of
market capitalisation.
Instead of listing, companies are actually departing the market, with only
164 companies now quoted against 171 last year. Thirty years ago, the Buenos
Aires market had more than 600 quoted companies. The government's <ORGANIZATION>Comision
Nacional de Valores</ORGANIZATION> checked capital markets regulator has approved more than
30 companies to list, but only a few have come to the market.
Low international interest rates make bond issues more attractive for
companies. <ORGANIZATION>Salomon Brothers</ORGANIZATION> says that last year more than 20 Argentine
companies issued Dollars 1.97bn in bonds, notes and commercial paper.
Possibly the government's greatest frustration is its inability to force
banks to lower interest rates and improve terms for industrial borrowers,
particularly for smaller companies unable to approach the local and
international capital markets.
<LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>'s banking system has changed beyond recognition from the chaos and
speculative frenzy of the <DATE>1980s</DATE>. In <DATE>June 1989</DATE>, as hyperinflation raged,
central bank liquid reserves were a mere Dollars 112m. In <DATE>April</DATE>, the second
anniversary of <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>'s celebrated convertibility law, the central bank's
liquid reserves exceeded Dollars 10bn.
As a result of the confidence brought by convertibility, bank deposits have
risen dramatically and maturities have been stretched out. Last month,
deposits - less than half of them in dollars - stood at Dollars 29.3bn,
against <ORGANIZATION>Dollars</ORGANIZATION> 18bn a year earlier. As a result, lending rose to Dollars
41.38bn, against Dollars 24.4bn in <DATE>April 1992</DATE>.
Banks are immensely profitable. Spreads at about 2-3 percentage points
remain high - although they have fallen sharply - and private banks have cut
costs aggressively and boosted lending and fee-based income.
For instance, <PERSON>Banco Frances</PERSON>, a locally owned commercial bank and one of
<LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>'s top five banks, saw its net assets grow 137 per cent to Dollars
1.08bn last year, against Dollars 378m prior to currency convertibility. Net
income in the year to <DATE>June 1993</DATE> is forecast at Dollars 47.6m, 37 per cent
more than last year.
Banks are less interested in lending to companies, especially risky small
and medium-sized ones. Instead, most of the profit growth is coming from
lending to consumers.
<PERSON>Mr Nicholas Grose Hodge</PERSON>, chief manager of <ORGANIZATION>Lloyds Bank</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>, says
'This continues to be a pretty good year for banks, with one notable
exception - that bad debts and credit risk are getting much worse.' Under an
admittedly broad central bank definition, problem loans stand at 4 to <MONEY>6 per
cent</MONEY> of the private banking system's total loans.
The government is trying use the weight of <ORGANIZATION>BNA</ORGANIZATION>, which is also the country's
biggest financial institution, to drive interest rates down. Interest rates
vary from a real negative monthly rate of 0.5 per cent on blue chip
corporate loans to a stinging real 5 to <MONEY>6 per cent</MONEY> per month for riskier
borrowers.
It has announced that <ORGANIZATION>BNA</ORGANIZATION> will lend Dollars 4.5bn at below market interest
rates to small companies and farmers. But bankers say <ORGANIZATION>BNA</ORGANIZATION>'s efforts are
unlikely to have the desired effect, simply because they have little
intention of competing in the small company and farm lending sectors.
Neither are central bank capital adequacy regulations making much
difference. Central bank regulations require banks charging higher interest
rates to set aside more capital. The government believed this would force
banks to lower rates. But banks, whose gearing, at about 8 times capital, is
low by international standards, have been happy to use their capital as
profitably as possible.
Bankers say that the real culprits are inefficient regional banks, most of
them owned by provincial governments, which distort interest rates
throughout the system. Their funding costs are high, a reflection of the
poor quality of their portfolios. Their operating costs are also higher,
because few government-owned banks have cut costs sufficiently. The
government rejects these claims, stating that banks - private and government
banks alike - remain highly inefficient.
Living with stability is becoming increasingly difficult for smaller and
medium sized banks, a majority of which flourished in the bad old days of
heavy inflation and high interest rates. <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> still has more than 160
banks of varying shapes and sizes. Many will probably merge, seek out niches
in the investment bank market or simply close down.
Some foreign banks with small branch networks have already decided to wind
up retail operations. Chase <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION> has sold its 15-branch network and its
credit card business.
<PERSON>Marcelo Podesta</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Chase</ORGANIZATION>'s Buenos Aires managing director, says: 'We did not
want to invest in systems to get up to the scale the (retail) market
required. It is not a priority investment for the bank.' Instead, Chase is
concentrating on sophisticated financial products and project finance for
large clients. The trouble is that with so many banks thinking the same way,
competition in the wholesale market is fierce.
Many retail and wholesale banks have taken an increasingly active role in
privatisations. Some, such as <ORGANIZATION>Banco Rio de la Plata</ORGANIZATION> - the country's biggest
bank - have taken direct stakes in privatised companies. Others have backed
investors in privatisations, underwritten privatisation share flotations, or
structured financing for privatised companies' investments.
<PERSON>Mr Fernandez</PERSON> wants banks to adopt greater securitisation of both their
assets and liabilities, which would reduce institutions' vulnerability to
mismatching or sudden shifts in market conditions. Foreign bankers also
expect the market to make increasing use of sophisticated derivative
products, such as bond- and equity-linked swaps and options.

<HEAD>Falkland Islanders Divided About British-Argentine Talks</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN LEONARD</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>STANLEY, Falkland Islands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Falklanders have mixed feelings
about talks on restoring relations between <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>,
which made their rocky, windswept archipelago a battleground seven
years ago.
   Most residents see negotiations as inevitable, but many fear a
deal that could cost them their British status. The first round is
scheduled for <DATE>Oct. 17-18</DATE> in <LOCATION>Madrid</LOCATION>.
   About 1,800 people live on the bleak islands 300 miles east of
<LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>'s tip. The main occupations are fishing and grazing sheep
on the chill moorlands.
   ``I think it's a bit worrying, really,'' said <PERSON>Nancy Poole</PERSON>.``How
far will they go? If they carry on, <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> will think <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> is
saying yes to a transfer of sovereignty eventually, I would think.''
   <PERSON>Mrs. Poole</PERSON> is secretary of Desire the Right, the only organized
political party. It hs taken no official position on the talks and
<PERSON>Mrs. Poole</PERSON> said her views were personal.
   <PERSON>Charles Keenleyside</PERSON>, an elected member of the islands' executive
and legislative councils, welcomeed the talks.
   He said a briefing by <PERSON>William Fullerton</PERSON>, the colonial governor,
convinced him ``we are not moving into a situation where items are
being discussed that are specifically against the wishes of the
Falkland Islanders.''
   Keenleyside added, however, that many people oppose any
resumption of links with <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> and have deep suspicions about
the negotiations.
   <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> invaded the British colony, which it calls the
<LOCATION>Malvinas</LOCATION>, in <DATE>April 1982</DATE> and <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> sent a naval force that expelled
the invaders in a 74-day war that cost nearly 1,000 lives. The
Argentines claim the islands under rights dating from Spanish
colonial days.
   Attempts to begin talks foundered on <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s refusal to
negotiate the sovereignty of the islands. They are beginning now
because <PERSON>Carlos Menem</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>'s new president, agreed to set the
sovereignty issue aside.
   Most islanders trust Prime Minister <PERSON>Margaret Thatcher</PERSON>'s
determination not to negotiate the islands away, but some wonder
what will happen when she leaves office.
   Senior magistrate <PERSON>Rosie McIlroy</PERSON> is grateful for movement.
   ``I'm glad to see there are talks because it seems to me that the
stalemate that existed before could not benefit anyone,'' she said.
``I do think some form of link with <LOCATION>South America</LOCATION> for the <LOCATION>Falkland
Islands</LOCATION> is necessary.''
   Issues at stake include shipping, air and communications links
with <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>, all severed since the war.
   Many islanders want no connections at all. They remember the
decade before the war, when the Argentine air force operated the
first regular air service to the islands and its ticket office in
<LOCATION>Stanley</LOCATION> was an intelligence outpost.
   When their troops landed, Argentine commanders had detailed
military and civilian knowledge of the islands.
   ``<LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>, OK,'' shop owner <PERSON>Peter Short</PERSON> said about
the talks, then added: ``Falklands and <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>, no.''
   <PERSON>Brian Summers</PERSON>, commercial officer for Cable and Wireless, said of
Menem: ``This man is far too smart. He is going to say all the right
things to the right people.''
   By playing down the sovereignty issue, he suggested, <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>
could gradually restore links of all kinds with the islands until
the transfer of sovereignty became inevitable.
   <PERSON>Joe Newell</PERSON>, a former farm manager, took the view that ``we're
going to have to deal with them sometime,'' and lawyer <PERSON>Kevin
Kilmartin</PERSON> said: ``It's quite obvious that <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>
should talk to each other.''
   <PERSON>Kilmartin</PERSON> said he hoped <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> would allow the Falklands
government to make policy in those areas of particular concern to
the islanders.
   Among the thorniest issues is protection of fish stocks in the
<LOCATION>South Atlantic</LOCATION>, where Argentine and Falkland fishing zones abut.
   Islanders also want <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> to stop influencing other South
American nations to deny access to a Falklands passenger and cargo
ship, which now may operate only to <ORGANIZATION>Punta Arenas</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>.

The oldest known drifting iceberg, a structure once twice the size of the 
nation's capital, is breaking up in the <LOCATION>South Atlantic</LOCATION>, officials said <DATE>today</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
First spotted by satellite in <DATE>January, 1978</DATE>, when it was about twice the size 
of <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION>, the iceberg was measured in <DATE>1983</DATE> by a <ORGANIZATION>Coast Guard</ORGANIZATION> 
icebreaker, which found that it still had one side exceeding 20 miles in 
length. 
</P>
<P>
"And that was only the tip of the iceberg," said <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> Capt. <PERSON>Tom Callaham</PERSON>, 
director of the <ORGANIZATION>National Oceanic</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Atmospheric Administration</ORGANIZATION>'s Ice Center. 
"For four years it was grounded in more than 200 feet of water." 
</P>
<P>
The iceberg drifted free in <DATE>1982</DATE> and moved west around <LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION>, driven by a 
current that circulated counterclockwise along the continent's coast, <PERSON>Callaham</PERSON> 
said. 
</P>
<P>
After a 5,700-mile odyssey that took it almost entirely around the Antarctic 
continent, the iceberg was last sighted in early <DATE>February</DATE> southwest of the 
<LOCATION>Falkland Islands</LOCATION>, off the Argentine coast, he said.

<HEAD>Argentina, Britain Resume Consular Relations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> resumed
consular ties on <DATE>Thursday</DATE> after a nearly eight-year gap that dated
back to the <LOCATION>Falkland Islands</LOCATION> War.
   <PERSON>Alan Hunt</PERSON> presented his credentials to the <ORGANIZATION>Foreign Ministry</ORGANIZATION> and
was accepted as <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s consul. A similar ceremony took place in
<LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, where <PERSON>Santos Goni</PERSON> was accredited as the Argentine consul.
   Since the <DATE>1982</DATE> war, which <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> launched to recover
territory in the <LOCATION>South Atlantic</LOCATION> it has claimed since the <DATE>last
century</DATE>, each country has maintained only an interest section in
the other: <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> at <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>'s embassy in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> at the
<ORGANIZATION>Swiss Embassy</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Buenos Aires</LOCATION>.
   Consular flags will be hoisted in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Buenos Aires</ORGANIZATION> on
<DATE>Friday</DATE>.
   The way was paved for a thaw in relations by the election of
<PERSON>Carlos Menem</PERSON> as <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>'s president last <DATE>May</DATE>. Menem dropped the
government's previous insistence that ownership of the Falklands be
an issue in any bilateral talks.
   The countries have agreed to resume air and maritime
communications and lift all remaining commercial and financial
restrictions and restrictive practices imposed since <DATE>1982</DATE>.
   They also agreed to an umbrella clause that protects their
respective claims to sovereignty over the islands, which are
inhabited by 1,800 people, mostly British descendants.
   A further meeting in <DATE>February</DATE> is expected to lead to resumption
of full diplomatic relations.
   Buenos Aires surrendered to a British task force on <DATE>June 14,
1982</DATE>, 74 days after invading the <LOCATION>South Atlantic</LOCATION> archipelago.

<HEAD>Peronist Candidate Demands Argentine Sovereignty over Falklands</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VICENTE L. PANETTA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Presidential candidate <PERSON>Carlos
Menem</PERSON> of the opposition <ORGANIZATION>Peronist Party</ORGANIZATION> was quoted on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> as
saying the <LOCATION>Falkland Islands</LOCATION> belong to <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> and will be
recovered ``even if we must suffer the spilling of blood.''
   ``<LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> will not give in,'' <PERSON>Menem</PERSON> said during a campaign
swing <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>, according to <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>'s two independent news
agencies, <ORGANIZATION>Diarios y Noticias</ORGANIZATION> and Noticias Argentinas.
   The Malvinas _ <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>'s name for the territory off its south
coast that it has claimed since <DATE>1810</DATE> _ ``will return to form part of
the national territory even if we must suffer the spilling of
blood,'' he was quoted as saying.
   Menem was on a visit to <LOCATION>Ushuaia</LOCATION>, 2,045 miles south of the capital
city of <ORGANIZATION>Buenos Aires</ORGANIZATION>.
   <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> went to war over the sparsely populated,
windswept and virtually treeless islands in <DATE>1982</DATE>. Argentine troops
invaded on <DATE>April 2</DATE>. A British expeditionary force recovered the
islands after a counterattack in which 712 Argentine and 255 British
soldiers died.
   The war lasted 74 days. <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> surrendered but refused to
formally declare an end to hostilities. Neither side resumed
diplomatic relations.
   <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s claim dates to <DATE>1833</DATE>. It has since fortified the islands
and enforced a 200-mile zone of exclusion around them. <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> has
tried to isolate the islands commercially by prohibiting direct
flights or ships from the mainland.
   It has tried to apply international pressure to force <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> to
negotiate the islands' sovereignty. British Prime Minister <PERSON>Margaret
Thatcher</PERSON> has refused.
   The two agencies also quoted Menem as saying: ``I don't know how
much time will pass or how much blood we will have to spill to see
that the <LOCATION>Malvinas</LOCATION> return to Argentine territory.''
   President <PERSON>Raul Alfonsin</PERSON> and Foreign Minister <PERSON>Dante Caputo</PERSON>, who
also is president of the <ORGANIZATION>U.N. General Assembly</ORGANIZATION>, have said <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>
inherited the islands upon declaring independence from <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>, and
the government will try to recover them peacefully through
negotiation.
   Ownership is an article of faith here. Argentine maps identify
the islands as the <LOCATION>Malvinas</LOCATION>, and schoolchildren are taught they were
stolen by <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>.
   Recovering the <LOCATION>Falklands</LOCATION> is a main foreign policy theme of
political groups from both left and right, along with the 4
million-member <ORGANIZATION>General Labor Confederation</ORGANIZATION> which backs <PERSON>Menem</PERSON>.
   Menem in the past said he would seek the islands' recovery by
diplomacy if he wins election on <DATE>May 14</DATE>. It was not known whether he
was speaking rhetorically in <LOCATION>Ushuaia</LOCATION>, or shifting and hardening his
position.
   A telephone call seeking comment from the British Interests
Section at the <ORGANIZATION>Swiss Embassy</ORGANIZATION> rang repeatedly but was not answered.

   <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> renewed diplomatic ties
severed nearly eight years ago over the Falklands War, but
<LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> said it would keep pressing its claim over the islands.
   Foreign Secretary <PERSON>Douglas Hurd</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> praised the accord
reached <DATE>Thursday</DATE> in <LOCATION>Madrid</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> after two days of talks.
   ``It underlines the fact that we have no quarrel with <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>,
and this has been achieved without any sacrifice of sovereignty,''
he said on <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s private Sky Television.
   Foreign Minister <PERSON>Domingo Cavallo</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> said <DATE>Thursday</DATE>'s
accord ``means passing from a state of war to a state of peace.''
   In <ORGANIZATION>Buenos Aires</ORGANIZATION>, President <PERSON>Carlos Menem</PERSON> said the accord opened
up trade possibilities for <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>, a major meat exporter. It
followed the resumption <DATE>last month</DATE> of direct air service between
the two nations, who traditionally were heavy trading partners.
   Menem also named Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON>Mario Campora</PERSON>, nephew
of former president <PERSON>Hector Campora</PERSON>, as the ambassador to <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>.
   Menem, however, repeated <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>'s claim to sovereignty of the
<LOCATION>South Atlantic</LOCATION> islands 300 miles off his country's southeastern
coast. He said its claim was not diminished by restoring diplomatic
ties.
   The Falklands War broke out after Argentine forces invaded the
British-ruled islands on <DATE>April 2, 1982</DATE>. <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> sent a military
task force that recaptured them after a 74-day war.
   The fighting claimed the lives of 712 Argentines, 255 Britons
and three islanders.
   <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> began ruling the islands as a colony in <DATE>1833</DATE> after <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>
ceased to govern <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> and abandoned the archipelago.
   <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> claims it inherited the islands under the name <ORGANIZATION>Las
Malvinas</ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> and says <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> stole them.
   British Prime Minister <PERSON>Margaret Thatcher</PERSON> has refused to discuss
Falklands sovereignty with <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>. In turn, <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> refused
until <DATE>Thursday</DATE> to declare the war officially over.
   U.N. Secretary-General <PERSON>Javier Perez de Cuellar</PERSON> applauded the
accord, saying it ``creates an atmosphere of confidence.''
   Talks between British and Argentine officials on resuming normal
relations began in <DATE>August</DATE> after <PERSON>Menem</PERSON> said <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> would not use
them to raise its claim over the <LOCATION>Falklands</LOCATION>.
   A key to the <LOCATION>Madrid</LOCATION> agreement was <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s agreement to lift
its 150-mile military protection zone around the islands. British
submarines, ships and planes have patrolled the zone.
   The islands are guarded by about 2,000 British troops.
   The British Foreign office said the two nations had agreed to
inform each other about movements of their warships and military
aircraft in key areas of the <LOCATION>South Atlantic</LOCATION> and give notice of
large military exercises.
   Under the arrangement, Argentine warships wishing to come within
50 miles of the islands and Argentine warplanes wishing to come
within 70 miles must give 48 hours warning.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Foreign Office</ORGANIZATION> said ambassadors will be exchanged ``in due
course.''
   Hurd said: ``It is for the <ORGANIZATION>Falkland Islanders</ORGANIZATION> to decide on their
own contacts with the mainland (<LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>).''
   Most of the 1,900 islanders are fiercely pro-British. Their
legislative council refused an invitation to join the <LOCATION>Madrid</LOCATION> talks.
   <PERSON>William Fullerton</PERSON>, governor of the islands, told British
television's Channel 4 News from <ORGANIZATION>Stanley</ORGANIZATION>, the capital: ``They
accept that there should be good relations between <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>.''
   He added, `The thing they would be worried about is the
sovereignty issue, and all along that has been specifically
excluded from the talks.''

<LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> announced an agreement <DATE>Thursday</DATE> to restore full 
diplomatic ties, nearly eight years after they fought a 74-day war over the 
<LOCATION>Falkland Islands</LOCATION>, a sparsely populated archipelago off <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>'s coast in the 
<LOCATION>South Atlantic Ocean</LOCATION>.

<P>
The announcement capped two days of talks here between Argentine and British

</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> agreed to lift by <DATE>March 31</DATE> a 150-mile military protection zone enforced

<P>
The pact calls for advance notice by each side of military exercises around the 
islands, which are home to about 1,900 people.

<P>
In the war over the islands, called the Malvinas by <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>, 712 Argentines, 
255 Britons and three islanders died. <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Buenos Aires</ORGANIZATION> broke diplomatic 
relations during the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement announced <DATE>Thursday</DATE> stipulated that talks will continue between

war cemeteries in the <LOCATION>Falklands</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
By mutual consent, the latest talks did not touch on claims to sovereignty over

   The two main watchdogs over Argentina's fragile economy
resigned after a massive run on the national currency.
   The resignations of Economics Minister Antonio Erman
Gonzalez and Central Bank Governor Javier Gonzalez Fraga
followed a 20% plunge in the value of the austral against the
U.S. dollar on Monday. The austral's plummeting fortunes --
it's down 40% so far this month -- is likely to translate
into a burst of inflation, undermining Argentina's shaky
economic recovery, economists say.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The resignation of <PERSON>Mr. Gonzalez</PERSON>, nicknamed "Superman" for
his initial success in cutting inflation, underlines the
continued instability of <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>'s politics and economy.
<PERSON>Mr. Gonzalez</PERSON>, an ally of President <PERSON>Carlos Menem</PERSON>, was viewed
abroad as a courageous minister. His resignation is a new
setback for <PERSON>Mr. Menem</PERSON> at a time when the president is trying
to contain damage caused by a short-lived military rebellion
last month, an unpopular amnesty granted to several of
<LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>'s former military rulers and accusations by the
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> ambassador of government corruption.
   A presidential spokesman said Foreign Minister <PERSON>Domingo
Cavallo</PERSON>, a Harvard-trained economist, will succeed <PERSON>Mr.
Gonzalez</PERSON>, becoming <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>'s fourth economics minister
since <PERSON>Mr. Menem</PERSON> took office 19 months ago. <PERSON>Mr. Gonzalez</PERSON> will
be the new defense minister.
   Argentine authorities closed banks and financial markets
yesterday, but said they would reopen today. Messrs. <PERSON>Cavallo</PERSON>
and <PERSON>Gonzalez</PERSON> gave a joint news conference <TIME>last night</TIME> and <PERSON>Mr.
Cavallo</PERSON> pledged to pursue <PERSON>Mr. Menem</PERSON>'s unpopular free-market
policies, including privatization of state companies and
trade liberalization, while seeking to bring down the
overvalued austral in order to boost production and exports.
   While <PERSON>Mr. Menem</PERSON> spent most of the day in conferences with
<PERSON>Messrs. Gonzalez</PERSON>, <PERSON>Cavallo</PERSON> and other top officials, scenes of
confusion filled the country. Cash machines ran out of bills
as they were raided by Argentines caught off-guard by the
bank closure. The federation of small shopkeepers urged
members to stay closed during the bank holiday because of
price uncertainty. Other stores raised prices by as much as
<PERCENT>40%</PERCENT>. The price of meat at the Liniers cattle market, the
country's biggest, rose by <PERCENT>30%</PERCENT> yesterday.
   Although the size and swiftness of the austral's nose dive
was a surprise, the market had been signaling its displeasure
with the artificially low exchange rate for some time. While
it succeeded in reducing inflation -- the consumer price
index has been below two digits for three months and fell to
<PERCENT>4.7%</PERCENT> in <DATE>December</DATE> -- the low rate created huge problems for
industrial exporters and farmers, who recently threatened to
stop paying taxes because of their declining revenue.
   President <PERSON>Menem</PERSON> reportedly asked conservative economist
<PERSON>Roberto Alemann</PERSON> to become <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>'s seventh central bank
president in 18 months. If <PERSON>Mr. Alemann</PERSON> accepts, a clash looms
with <PERSON>Mr. Cavallo</PERSON>. <PERSON>Mr. Alemann</PERSON>, who twice served as
<LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>'s economy minister, reportedly wants autonomy for
the <ORGANIZATION>Central Bank</ORGANIZATION>, which regulates interest rates, the money
supply and transfers to heavily indebted provincial banks.

<HEAD>British, Argentine Officials Open Talks on Falklands</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British and Argentine officials opened two
days of talks <DATE>Thursday</DATE> on issues related to the disputed <LOCATION>Falkland
Islands</LOCATION>, a step toward restoring full diplomatic ties, embassy
spokesmen said.
   An <ORGANIZATION>Argentine Embassy</ORGANIZATION> official who spoke on condition of
anonymity said <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> would ask <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> to drop the 150-mile
military ``protection zone'' around the Falklands, which <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>
calls the <LOCATION>Malvinas Islands</LOCATION>.
   The zone has been enforced since <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> invaded the <LOCATION>South
Atlantic</LOCATION> islands in <DATE>1982</DATE>. The Argentine soldiers were driven off by
British troops after a 74-day war.
   Britain now requires Argentine military ships to request and
receive British permission before entering the zone.
   The talks <DATE>Thursday</DATE> were held at the Argentine ambassador's
residence in central <LOCATION>Madrid</LOCATION>. On <DATE>Friday</DATE>, the talks will move across
the street to the <ORGANIZATION>British Embassy</ORGANIZATION>.
   A <ORGANIZATION>British Embassy</ORGANIZATION> spokesman said details of the meetings were
not expected to be made public.
   The talks serve as a preliminary step to high-level meetings in
<LOCATION>Madrid</LOCATION> on <DATE>Feb. 14-15</DATE> that will be aimed at restoring full
diplomatic relations.
   <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> has claimed the islands since declaring independence
from <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> in <DATE>1816</DATE>. British claims to the islands are based on
effective occupation since <DATE>1833</DATE>.
   Relations between the two countries have improved considerably
since <DATE>October</DATE>, when two days of talks in <LOCATION>Madrid</LOCATION> ended with the
restoration of consular relations and an agreement to move toward
normal diplomatic and economic relations.
   Since then, <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> has allowed British vessels and planes to
operate freely in Argentine territory, and <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> has lifted a
restriction on the navigation of Argentine merchant ships in the
150-mile military protection zone around the <LOCATION>Falklands</LOCATION>.
   <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s five-man delegation at this week's talks was led by
<PERSON>Adrian Beamish</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>Foreign Office</ORGANIZATION>'s assistant undersecretary of
state for the <LOCATION>Americas</LOCATION>.
   The Argentine side was headed by <PERSON>Jose Maria Otegui</PERSON>,
director-general for the <LOCATION>Malvinas</LOCATION>.

FT  05 JUN 93 / Glory days gone for now: Edward Balls says England's
football decline mirrors its economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Gutted', 'gob-smacked', 'sick as a parrot' - no footballing cliche can
adequately characterise the depth of national despair that engulfed <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>
after <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>'s World Cup defeat at the hands of <LOCATION>Norway</LOCATION>.
<LOCATION>England</LOCATION> - where the game of football was invented - was beaten 2-0 in <LOCATION>Oslo</LOCATION>
and probably ejected from the <DATE>1994</DATE> World Cup final round, to be held in
<LOCATION>America</LOCATION> next year.
And at the hands of <LOCATION>Norway</LOCATION>, too. <LOCATION>Norway</LOCATION>, more famous for its fish than its
football, with a population a 10th that of <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>'s. A country that
worshipped English soccer (as <ORGANIZATION>BBC</ORGANIZATION> commentator <PERSON>John Motson</PERSON> reminded his
unfortunate audience) had trounced <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>'s national team.
But the defeat has been interpreted as more than just a freak - a single
poor performance by a disorganised team. Instead, it is seen as further
evidence that the decline of English football has become terminal. 'Fatal
flaws of woeful <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> exposed', thundered The Times; 'Norse manure', The
Sun added.
Yet was anyone really surprised? <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> still has a seat on the <ORGANIZATION>UN Security
Council</ORGANIZATION>; it has nuclear weapons; it even won the World Cup (at home) in
<DATE>1966</DATE>. But surely the decline of English football has gone hand in hand with
<LOCATION>England</LOCATION>'s relative economic decline.
Starting with the 6-3 home defeat at the hands of <LOCATION>Hungary</LOCATION> in <DATE>1953</DATE>, the
first-ever defeat at <LOCATION>Wembley</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>'s footballing star has been waning,
along with its economic clout. Since <DATE>1953</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>England</ORGANIZATION> has slipped from second to
fifth in the world in terms of output; it has fallen considerably further
down the league table of income per head. More populous nations, such as
<LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>, have risen to prominence on the world footballing
stage.
The <ORGANIZATION>FT</ORGANIZATION>'s analysis of <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>'s World Cup record since <DATE>1953</DATE> suggests that the
English soccer team has continued to do better than might be expected from
the country's size and economic power. The analysis awards points for
performance in the final rounds of the World Cup (failure to qualify scores
no points). It divides the 10 World Cup competitions from <DATE>1953</DATE> into two
groups, the split coming between the <DATE>1970</DATE> and <DATE>1974</DATE> contests. The year <DATE>1973</DATE>
was a watershed for <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>. In addition to the <ORGANIZATION>Opec</ORGANIZATION> oil shock and the
<PERSON>Barber</PERSON> boom, it saw the English soccer team draw 1-1 with <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION> at <ORGANIZATION>Wembley</ORGANIZATION>
in <DATE>October</DATE>. The side was eliminated from the competition during the
qualifying stages (see charts).
From <DATE>1954</DATE> to <DATE>1970</DATE>, English soccer continued to fare comparatively well,
despite the country being overtaken in economic size by <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, and suffering the shock of sterling's <DATE>1967</DATE> devaluation. The English
team ranked third, well behind <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>.
From <DATE>1970</DATE> on, it was downhill all the way. Inflation soared during the
<DATE>1970s</DATE>, labour relations deteriorated, and the <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> team failed to qualify
for either World Cup tournament. Despite qualifying in <DATE>1982</DATE>, <DATE>1986</DATE> and <DATE>1990</DATE>,
<LOCATION>England</LOCATION> has been overtaken in the rankings by <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Holland</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION>. Only <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>'s fortuitous <DATE>1990</DATE> victory over <LOCATION>Cameroon</LOCATION> prevented the
team from falling behind <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Belgium</LOCATION>.
The biggest shifts in relative soccer performance since <DATE>1970</DATE> have been the
slippage of <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> and the collapse of the communist teams - only <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION> has
bucked the trend, coming from nowhere to sixth place in <DATE>1974-90</DATE>; the rise of
continental European football; and the enormous success of <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> since
the early <DATE>1970s</DATE>.
The economic background to these changes provides few clues as to <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>'s
relative footballing decline. High and fluctuating inflation since <DATE>1973</DATE>
might have been a clue to the decline of both <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>, though on
different scales, were it not for the rise of <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>. Nor does the
decline of Soviet-style collectivism help explain why British soccer has
withered alongside British socialism. If anything, the rise of Thatcherite
individualism is a better explanation for <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>'s poor performance at team
games.
Despite the present gloom, it appears that <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>'s declining World Cup
performance has continued to outstrip its economic record. Over the period
1974-90, <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> ranked seventh in the FT World Cup league table. But among
World Cup qualifying nations, <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> now has only the 11th-biggest
population and the 14th-highest income per head. Defeat by <LOCATION>Norway</LOCATION> is not so
surprising. Though smaller, it is now much richer than <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> - Dollars
6,000 a person a year richer in <DATE>1990</DATE>, according to the <ORGANIZATION>World Bank</ORGANIZATION>.
So why has England taken the defeat so badly? Part of the explanation is
economic. For a country grappling to get out of recession, and with a prime
minister ill at ease with himself, failure to qualify for the <DATE>1994</DATE> World Cup
final seems disastrous. The other reason is more simple: <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>'s
performance on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> was terrible. A shocked <PERSON>Mr Graham Taylor</PERSON>, the
<LOCATION>England</LOCATION> manager, accused his players of giving up. 'It's a performance that
will make people back home very angry,' he said.
But <PERSON>Mr Taylor</PERSON> must take his share of the blame. It was his last-minute
tactical decisions which caused the players to appear like 'headless
chickens' on the pitch. Refusing to select <PERSON>Chris Waddle</PERSON>, and playing <PERSON>Gary
Pallister</PERSON> at left-back, made little sense.
Following <PERSON>Mr John Major</PERSON>'s example, he will have to consider a reshuffle. But
it may not be enough to produce a winning team.

FT  30 JUL 92 / Latin America Debt Crisis: Chronolgy of events - 1982-1985 /
Ten years ago next month the Latin American debt crisis broke - and threw
the world financial system into turmoil. On these pages writers who followed
the story for the Financial Times from the outset analyse how the crisis was
handled. And they pose the question: Is there life after debt?

1982
<LOCATION>MEXICO</LOCATION>, facing foreign borrowing requirement of more than Dollars 20bn
(Pounds 10.4bn) for the year, raises Dollars 5bn in <DATE>first quarter</DATE>, although
at higher interest rates than previously. Outflow of dollars prompts several
sharp devaluations of peso during year. Inflation accelerates rapidly and
oil revenues decline.
<DATE>April</DATE> - <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>'s invasion of <LOCATION>Falkland Islands</LOCATION> provokes conflict with
<LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> and slows new lending to <LOCATION>Latin America</LOCATION>. Mexico draws on swap line
with <ORGANIZATION>US Federal Reserve</ORGANIZATION> and meets difficulties in arranging loans from
banks.
<DATE>August</DATE> - <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> introduces exchange controls, seeks emergency finance from
<LOCATION>US</LOCATION> and international financial institutions. On <DATE>August 20</DATE> finance minister
meets creditor banks in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> and announces three-month moratorium on
Dollars 10bn of debt principal repayments. Central banks agree Dollars
1.85bn emergency loan to <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> 'to ensure continued smooth functioning of
the international financing system'. US provides Dollars 2bn credit. Mexico
to seek <ORGANIZATION>International Monetary Fund</ORGANIZATION> and bank loans. Creditor banks form
advisory committee chaired by <ORGANIZATION>Citibank</ORGANIZATION>.
<DATE>September</DATE> - <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> nationalises banks and imposes total exchange control.
Central bank heads consider Latin American payment problems. One says: 'To
say that we are concerned could be an understatement.' International
Monetary Fund and <ORGANIZATION>World Bank</ORGANIZATION> hold annual meetings in <LOCATION>Toronto</LOCATION> in atmosphere
of panic.
<DATE>October</DATE> - <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> arranges emergency short-term bank loan, sells gold.
<DATE>November</DATE> - <ORGANIZATION>IMF</ORGANIZATION> managing director <ORGANIZATION>Jacques de Larosiere</ORGANIZATION> tells bank chairmen he
expects them to make new Dollars 5bn loan to <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> and Dollars 1.5bn loan
to <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>, to support economic policies under <ORGANIZATION>International Monetary Fund</ORGANIZATION>
programmes.
<DATE>December</DATE> - Banks commit to <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> loan. <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> arranges Dollars 1.5bn in
emergency loans from <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> and says it will seek new 'jumbo' bank loan. But, as
year ends, <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> also halts repayment of debt principal.
<DATE>1983
January</DATE> - Pattern emerges for handling LDC debt problems. Key elements are:
IMF-agreed economic programme and <ORGANIZATION>IMF</ORGANIZATION> loan, rescheduling of some debt
principal repayments to banks and governments, and large new loans. This
involves close co-operation among debtors, international institutions and
creditors. Packages under way for <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Yugoslavia</LOCATION> and,
soon, <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Peru</LOCATION> contain all these elements. Bridging loans tide
borrowers over until the full agreements are signed.
<DATE>February</DATE> - <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> signs Dollars 4bn new bank loan and Dollars 4.8bn
rescheduling, but suffers severe difficulties in maintaining short-term
interbank lines of credit to foreign branches of its banks, a crucial
element of financing programme. It misses <DATE>first-quarter</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>International
Monetary Fund</ORGANIZATION> economic targets. Interest payment arrears build up to Dollars
2bn by <DATE>August</DATE>. Economic programme and rescue package have to be re-drawn.
March - <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>'s banks sign Dollars 5bn new loan (agreed in <DATE>1982</DATE>) and, in
<DATE>August</DATE>, agreements rescheduling Dollars 20bn of debt principal falling due
to banks in <DATE>1983</DATE> and <DATE>1984</DATE>.
<DATE>September</DATE> - At <ORGANIZATION>International Monetary Fund</ORGANIZATION> annual meeting, <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> agrees in
principle with creditors on Dollars 11bn rescue package involving Dollars
6.5bn new bank loan, rescheduling of debts falling due up to the end of
<DATE>1984</DATE>. Leading creditor banks and central bankers embark on successful
worldwide 'roadshow' to persuade other creditor banks to join the deal.
<LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> begins to reduce interest arrears.
1984
<LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> builds up interest arrears of Dollars 2.7bn by end-March. Impasse
in <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>'s negotiations with <ORGANIZATION>IMF</ORGANIZATION> and banks means <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> banks must count
loans as 'non-performing' for first time in debt crisis.
<DATE>June</DATE> - Banks agree in principle to provide 'multi-year rescheduling
agreement' (Myra) for <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>, lowering interest rates on rescheduled debt
and stretching out six years' maturities, totalling Dollars 48bn. <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION>
signs Myra in <DATE>July</DATE>. In <DATE>September</DATE> Venezuela agrees in principle on <LOCATION>Dollars
21bn Myra</LOCATION>. In <DATE>December</DATE> Argentina agrees in principle on Dollars 14bn Myra
and agrees to cut interest arrears, and <ORGANIZATION>International Monetary Fund</ORGANIZATION> endorses
economic programme.
<DATE>1985</DATE>
<ORGANIZATION>International Monetary Fund</ORGANIZATION> suspends loans to <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> as
economic targets missed. In negotiation of new targets, <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> seeks greater
flexibility from <ORGANIZATION>International Monetary Fund</ORGANIZATION> - but in <DATE>August</DATE> finance
minister and central bank governor resign in frustration over lack of
economic austerity policies, and government embarks on expansionist
approach. <LOCATION>Peru</LOCATION> announces unilateral limit on debt service payments: 10 per
cent of export receipts. <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> agrees new economic stabilisation package
with <ORGANIZATION>International Monetary Fund</ORGANIZATION> as inflation reaces 1,000 per cent. In
<DATE>July</DATE>, <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> introduces new austerity package as oil revenues drop and
misses International Monetary Fund targets. In <DATE>September</DATE>, earthquakes
devastate <LOCATION>Mexico City</LOCATION>. <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> seeks <ORGANIZATION>International Monetary Fund</ORGANIZATION> 'monitoring
of economy' rather than full agreement.
<DATE>September</DATE> - At <ORGANIZATION>International Monetary Fund</ORGANIZATION> annual meeting in <LOCATION>Seoul</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>
treasury secretary <PERSON>James Baker</PERSON> unveils new approach to debt, known as
<ORGANIZATION>Programme</ORGANIZATION> for Sustained Growth or Baker Plan. Key elements are:
Economic reform by debtor countries to promote growth and balance of
payments adjustment, and to reduce inflation.
Increased structural adjustment lending by multilateral development banks as
well as continued central role for <ORGANIZATION>IMF</ORGANIZATION>.
Increased lending by commercial banks: net new lending of Dollars 20bn over
next three years to heavily indebted middle-income countries.
Maintenance of case-by-case approach to debtors.
Larger debtors and creditors give qualified support to <PERSON>Baker</PERSON> Plan.
Chronology of events: <DATE>1986-1992
1986
June</DATE> - Mexican finance minister <PERSON>Jesus Silva Herzog</PERSON> resigns as oil revenues
drop and economy worsens. In <DATE>July</DATE> his successor <PERSON>Gustavo Petricioli</PERSON> agrees
growth-oriented economic programme with <ORGANIZATION>International Monetary Fund</ORGANIZATION>,
clearing the way for negotiations with banks.
At <ORGANIZATION>International Monetary Fund</ORGANIZATION> annual meeting, a year after <PERSON>Baker</PERSON> Plan
announced, banks and <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> agree in principle on Dollars 7.7bn new loan and
Dollars 54bn loan rescheduling, first under the plan, with 20-year maturity
and <PERCENT>13/16 percentage point</PERCENT> interest margin - seen as too concessional by
some banks. By <DATE>December</DATE> banks' commitments to loan are sufficient to put the
<ORGANIZATION>International Monetary Fund</ORGANIZATION>'s rescue package into effect.
<DATE>1987
February</DATE> - <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> halts interest payments on Dollars 68bn of debt to banks.
<DATE>April</DATE> - <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> agrees with banks in principle on <PERSON>Baker</PERSON> Plan deal for new
loan and Dollars 24bn rescheduling on terms similar to <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>'s. Package
features first 'menu of options,' including chance for banks to convert
loans into 'exit' bonds.
May - <ORGANIZATION>Citicorp</ORGANIZATION>, biggest lender to third world, adds Dollars 3bn to loan loss
reserves and says it will seek to 'liquefy' third world loan portfolio by
selling loans and using instruments such as debt/equity swaps. Its share
price rises. Other <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> banks follow with similar loss provisions.
<DATE>August</DATE> - <ORGANIZATION>Bank of England</ORGANIZATION> issues guidelines to <ORGANIZATION>UK</ORGANIZATION> banks on loss provisions.
<DATE>September</DATE> - <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> proposes to convert Dollars 34bn of bank debt into
securities, taking advantage of discount at which loans trade in secondary
market. It is rebuffed by <PERSON>Mr Baker</PERSON>. He proposes new <ORGANIZATION>International Monetary
Fund</ORGANIZATION> funding facility to compensate debtors for unforeseen shocks which
could undermine Fund programmes.
<DATE>November</DATE> - <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> and banks reach interim agreement to end halt in interest
payments. <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> agrees to seek accord with Fund on economic programme.
<DATE>December</DATE> - <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> and J P <PERSON>Morgan</PERSON>, the US bank, announce innovative plan to
retire Dollars 20bn of debt in exchange for securities with principal backed
by US zero coupon <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> bonds held by <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>. Banks invited to tender
loans competitively - those putting the highest discount on their loans to
win bonds.
<DATE>1988
March</DATE> - Mexican exchange auction results in issue of only Dollars 2.5bn of
bonds in exchange for Dollars 3.6bn of bank debt, an average discount of 33
per cent. <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> holds first debt-for-equity auction.
<DATE>June</DATE> - <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>'s creditor banks agree in principle on Dollars 5.2bn loan and
<ORGANIZATION>Dollars</ORGANIZATION> 61bn rescheduling.
<DATE>October</DATE> - <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> makes Dollars 3.5bn emergency loan to <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>, again suffering
liquidity problems following drop in oil price.
<DATE>1989
March</DATE> - <ORGANIZATION>US Treasury</ORGANIZATION> secretary <PERSON>Nicholas Brady</PERSON> announces controversial
'suggestions' on debt problems, dubbed the Brady Plan. Key new element
embraces concept of allowing debtors, provided they pursue approved economic
policies, to reduce outstanding debt. However, this should be on a voluntary
basis for creditors - along lines of Mexico/Morgan offer. International
Monetary Fund, industrialised countries and leading bankers give debt relief
qualified backing.
<DATE>July</DATE> - <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> and banks agree first Brady Plan deal covering Dollars 52bn of
debt, including options for banks to exchange loans for collateralised
floating rate bonds at a 35 per cent discount, exchange loans for bonds of
same par value but lower fixed interest rate, or advance new money to
finance <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>'s interest payments.
<DATE>September</DATE> - <ORGANIZATION>J P Morgan</ORGANIZATION> adds Dollars 2bn to loan loss reserves, bringing them
to a level equalling its medium- and long-term lending to countries which
have restructured debts. It says increase reflects rising expectations about
the size of debt reductions possible under Brady initiative. Its share price
rises. US President <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON> appeals to banks to support Brady Plan.
<DATE>November</DATE> - UK banks increase provisions against third world debt losses.
<ORGANIZATION>Lloyds Bank</ORGANIZATION> says 15 of 29 problem countries are not paying interest and that
it has made 100 per cent provisions for more than half of the 29. <LOCATION>Peru</LOCATION>,
which had cut itself off from the <ORGANIZATION>International Monetary Fund</ORGANIZATION> and built up
Dollars 800m of arrears to the Fund, agrees to resume payments to
<ORGANIZATION>International Monetary Fund</ORGANIZATION> and accept economic programme.
<DATE>1990</DATE>
Of <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>'s creditor banks, 49 per cent choose to exchange Dollars 22bn of
debt for lower interest, fixed-rate bonds of same face value, and 41 per
cent choose to exchange Dollars 20bn of debt for floating-rate bonds at 35
per cent discount to face value, saving <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> a total of Dollars 1.3bn per
year. <LOCATION>Costa Rica</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Uruguay</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION> agree <PERSON>Brady</PERSON> debt
reduction deals.
<DATE>1991
April</DATE> - <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> reaches preliminary agreement on settling Dollars 8bn of
interest arrears to banks.
<DATE>September</DATE> - <ORGANIZATION>International Monetary Fund</ORGANIZATION> approves <LOCATION>Peru</LOCATION> economic programme.
<DATE>October</DATE> - <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Nafinsa</ORGANIZATION> issues 10-year Eurobond, longest maturity for
Latin American capital market issue since debt crisis began.
<DATE>1992
April</DATE> - <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> reaches outline agreement on <LOCATION>Brady</LOCATION> deal covering Dollars
23bn of debt and <ORGANIZATION>Dollars</ORGANIZATION> 8bn of interest arrears.
<DATE>July</DATE> - <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> reaches outline deal on <LOCATION>Brady</LOCATION> deal covering Dollars 44bn of
debt. Brady says after <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> agreement that more than <MONEY>90 per cent</MONEY> of the
commercial bank debt of big debtor countries would be dealt with. He says:
'It represents a milestone in finally putting the Latin American debt crisis
behind us.'

   Prime Minister <PERSON>Margaret Thatcher</PERSON> called <DATE>Friday</DATE> for
improved commercial and diplomatic relations with <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>, but
she also insisted <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> retain control of the disputed <LOCATION>Falkland
Islands</LOCATION>.
   In a Christmas address to the 1,800 islanders, <PERSON>Mrs. Thatcher</PERSON>
said <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>, in recent talks with the new Argentine government,
had not wavered from its position that control of the <LOCATION>South
Atlantic</LOCATION> islands is not negotiable.
   In the speech broadcast by the <ORGANIZATION>British Broadcasting Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Mrs.
Thatcher</PERSON> said <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> would uphold its commitments to residents of
the <LOCATION>Falklands</LOCATION>.
   Argentine troops invaded the British colony off southern
<LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> in <DATE>1982</DATE>. Britain sent troops and drove out the invaders
in a 74-day war. Diplomatic relations between the two countries
were broken.
   <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> has claimed sovereignty to the islands it calls the
<LOCATION>Malvinas</LOCATION> since <DATE>1832</DATE>.
   On <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Mrs. Thatcher</PERSON> said: ``We want to improve ordinary

<HEAD>Britain Hopes for Better Relations with Argentina</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign Office Minister <PERSON>Tim Sainsbury</PERSON> said <DATE>Friday</DATE>
that <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>'s new president appears to be seeking ``more
normal'' relations, and <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> will respond positively.
   ``I hope we can look forward to a period of tangible achievement
in our relations with <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>; that's certainly our aim,''
<ORGANIZATION>Sainsbury</ORGANIZATION> told the <ORGANIZATION>House of Commons Friday before Parliament</ORGANIZATION>
adjourned for the <DATE>summer</DATE> recess.
   <ORGANIZATION>Sainsbury</ORGANIZATION>, under questioning from a legislator, refused to say
if Argentine President <PERSON>Carlos Menem</PERSON> has sought to reopen
negotiations with <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> over the disputed <LOCATION>Falkand Islands</LOCATION>, off
the coast of <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>, and the restoration of diplomatic relations.
   ``It is a very delicate matter. You would not expect me to go
into details at this stage,'' said <ORGANIZATION>Sainsbury</ORGANIZATION>. ``But you may rest
assured that we will respond positively to any proposals consistent
with our commitment to the Falkland Islanders.''
   He said <PERSON>Menem</PERSON>, who took office <DATE>July 8</DATE>, apparently seeks improved
relations while while putting aside the ``delicate issue'' of
sovereignty over the <LOCATION>Falklands</LOCATION>.
   <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> invaded and occupied the British colony in <DATE>1982</DATE>, but
British forces recaptured the islands in a 74-day war.
   After the war <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> promised the 1,600 Falklands residents,
most of whom are of British descent, that it would not negotiate
the issue of sovereignty.
   Previous attempts to improve relations have foundered on the
question of sovereignty.
   <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> wants to normalize trade relations with <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>,
negotiate a fishing agreement, re-establish air links and reduce
tension. That could lead to a reduction of the costs of maintaining
a British military garrison on the islands.
   During the debate <ORGANIZATION>Conservative Party</ORGANIZATION> legislator <PERSON>Ray Whitney</PERSON> said
<PERSON>Menem</PERSON> had created a ``distinct and new atmosphere which we must
seize and take advantage of.''
   ``We cannot miss the opportunity which is now opening up,''
added <PERSON>Whitney</PERSON>, who was chairman of the governing Conservatives'
foreign affairs committee during the war for the <LOCATION>Falkland Islands</LOCATION>,
known in <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> as the <LOCATION>Malvinas Islands</LOCATION>.
   He said new diplomatic moves would disturb the islanders, who
want to maintain the present status, but their long-term interests
``can only be guaranteed by a different set of relationships''
between <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Argentina Plans Defensive Alert During British Exercises In
Falklands</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM H. HEATH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> said <DATE>Thursday</DATE> it plans
a ``defensive alert'' during scheduled British military exercises
in the <LOCATION>Falkland Islands</LOCATION> and if necessary ``will execute
corresponding defense plans.''
   The foreign and defense ministries denounced the exercises, due
to begin <DATE>Monday</DATE> and end <DATE>March 31</DATE>, as ``violating ... (<LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>'s )
sovereign rights'' over the islands, which this nation claims were
stolen by the British in <DATE>1833</DATE>.
   <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> has said the exercises will chill efforts to restore
relations, broken in <DATE>1982</DATE> when the two countries fought a bloody,
74-day war over the remote <LOCATION>South Atlantic</LOCATION> islands.
   A joint comminque by the two ministries said the exercises
contradict <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> resolutions declaring the region a zone of peace.
British officials have said the exercises are essentially defensive.
   The statement said that although <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> ``repeatedly has
expressed willingness to resolve the dispute in peaceful and
negotiated form'' the government is obliged to ``protect the lives
and property of those who inhabit Argentine soil'' and has adopted
a defensive alert.
   The British exercises will be strictly watched, the ministries
said.
   ``In the event it is necessary, corresponding defense plans''
will be executed, the communique said.
   The ministries did not go into specifics.
   But the statement warned foreign shipping that vessels will be
subject to ``visit, inspection or capture under terms of
international law'' by Argentine authorities ``with the objective
of avoiding their involvement in incidents.''
   The maneuvers were reported to include planned use of Phantom
fighter jets and hundreds of British troops.
   On <DATE>April 2, 1982</DATE>, Argentine troops captured the islands, but
<LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> sent a task force and defeated the Argentines. In the
fighting, 712 Argentines and 256 British were killed.
   Brig. Gen. <PERSON>Ernesto Crespo</PERSON>, air force chief of staff, said
<DATE>Thursday</DATE> that his branch will remain alert to any orders it may
receive from the government regarding the British maneuvers.
   ``You must consider that this is not a simple exercise in the
<LOCATION>Malvinas</LOCATION> (<LOCATION>Falkland</LOCATION>) Islands,'' <PERSON>Crespo</PERSON> said. ``It is much more
important and involves peace in the <LOCATION>South Atlantic</LOCATION> and, as a
result, not only our country but other American states as well.''

FT  17 JAN 94 / Wrapped in a mutual embrace / A look at progress towards
economic integration in Latin America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM and ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the presidents of <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> meet in a tiny Uruguayan
colonial town <DATE>today</DATE>, long-running arguments are likely to be heard around
the table. <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> are at loggerheads over Argentine complaints
that it is a dumping ground for cheap Brazilian industrial products.
But the two presidents might pause and contemplate how much has already been
achieved in integrating their two economies in <LOCATION>Latin America</LOCATION>'s largest
free-trade area. After decades of virtually ignoring each other as export
markets, largely because of trade barriers and a preference for selling to
<LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION>, the two countries are discovering their mutual
attractions.
The free trade initative, known as Mercosul in <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Mercosur</ORGANIZATION> among its
Spanish-speaking neighbours, was signed in <DATE>March 1991</DATE> between <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Uruguay</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Paraguay</LOCATION>. It called for the free movement of capital,
goods and services between the four countries, and for the establishment of
a common tariff system for trade with non-Mercosul countries by the end of
this year. Tariffs on goods ranging from Roquefort cheese to metal doors
have already been cut by up to 80 per cent.
But trying to set up in four years what took the <LOCATION>European Union</LOCATION> nearly 40
has led to problems.
<LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>, which account for more than <MONEY>95 per cent</MONEY> of Mercosul's
GDP, have been arguing since the middle of <DATE>last year</DATE> about which industries
should enjoy special protection. They are now expected to announce a list of
goods, for example Brazilian telecommunications, which would retain local
rather than common external tariffs until the end of the century. This would
protect sensitive sectors from more efficient foreign competition.
Because of such exclusions, the original intention of totally free trade is
unlikely to be met by <DATE>1995</DATE>, and will probably have to wait until later in
the decade or perhaps the next century.
But businesspeople in <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> say they are realising the
advantages of closer economic ties, despite the diplomatic disputes. Trade
is growing rapidly and looks set to continue to accelerate even if the
free-trade agreement does not meet its deadline.
Trade between the two countries increased 63 per cent to Dollars 4.93bn
(Pounds 3.33bn) in <DATE>1992</DATE>, helped by falling tariffs. In the <DATE>first quarter</DATE> of
last year, the latest figures available, trade between the two grew 57 per
cent to Dollars 1.34bn over the same period in <DATE>1992</DATE>. The growth, from a low
base, has mainly come from Brazilian exports of industrial products ranging
from cars to chemicals and Argentine exports of agricultural goods and oil,
reflecting the two economies' relative strengths.
Foreign and domestic companies are starting to look at <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>
as a single market. Autolatina, the holding company for <ORGANIZATION>Volkswagen</ORGANIZATION> and
<ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION>'s combined operations in the two countries with an annual turnover of
about Dollars 8bn, last year completed a three-year programme to standardise
all products and parts for both markets, which were previously treated
separately. A new factory in <LOCATION>Cordoba</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>, is now supplying about 90
per cent of the transmissions used in the company's Brazilian-built
mid-sized cars.
'These sorts of product decisions show our confidence in Mercosul. You don't
move production unless you are confident,' says <PERSON>Mr Pierre-Alain De Smedt</PERSON>,
president of <ORGANIZATION>Autolatina</ORGANIZATION>.
Food companies are making similar moves. <ORGANIZATION>Sadia</ORGANIZATION>, one of <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>'s largest food
companies, recently set up a joint venture in <ORGANIZATION>Buenos Aires</ORGANIZATION> with an Argentine
company to oversee distribution of its products.
<PERSON>Carlos Eduardo Sant'Anna</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>Sadia</ORGANIZATION> director responsible for the joint
venture, says: '<LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> is not just another foreign market, but the
foreign market for us. We see a belt that goes from <LOCATION>Rio de Janeiro</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Sao
Paulo</LOCATION>, southern <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Buenos Aires</PERSON> to <LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION> (the Chilean capital).
Here you have 65 per cent of <LOCATION>South America</LOCATION>'s GDP.'
Growth in trade has been rapid partly because <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> are
complementary economies. <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> is rich in energy, <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> is not.
<LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> last year became <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>'s second-largest oil supplier behind <LOCATION>Saudi
Arabia</LOCATION>. Most of <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>'s electricity is produced by hydroelectric dams,
whereas <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> has a large thermal system.
Moreover, <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> has big grain surpluses, while <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> is a net food
importer. <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>'s industry is obsolete. If it is to grow, it needs the
economies of scale which free access to the much bigger Brazilian market can
provide. Brazilian industry is more competitive than <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>'s and is
attracted by the prospects of adding 33m Argentine consumers to the 150m in
<LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>.
Cross-border links are not just a corporate phenomenon. For example, tourism
is developing and about 700,000 Argentine tourists are expected to take
their holidays in <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> this <DATE>summer</DATE>.
Argentines travelling to <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> have brought back some of their neighbour's
consumption habits, such as a passion for ice-cold beer. Brahma, <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>'s
biggest beer company, last year began trucking bottled beer 1,000 miles from
one of its breweries in southern <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> to <PERSON>Buenos Aires</PERSON>, aiming for a 3-4
per cent share of the Argentine market over the next two years. Now it is
planning a brewery near <PERSON>Buenos Aires</PERSON>.
Such links are fuelling tensions as well as growth. Some Argentine
industries, especially textiles, paper and steel, have complained of a flood
of cheaper Brazilian imports as tariffs have come down. In response,
<LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> started in <DATE>1992</DATE> imposing a number of protectionist measures, such
as anti-dumping measures against Brazilian farm machinery and spark plugs.
There are concerns in <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>, too. In the southern Brazilian state of <LOCATION>Rio
Grande</LOCATION> do Sul, which borders <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Uruguay</LOCATION>, farmers are worried that
they will soon have to compete with products from across the frontiers,
where land is cheaper and the soil more fertile.
'<ORGANIZATION>Rio Grande do Sul</ORGANIZATION> is perhaps the state most threatened by Mercosul,
especially our products like jams, vegetables and wines, and these employ a
lot of people,' according to <PERSON>Mr Dagoberto Lima Godoy</PERSON>, president of the
state's federation of industries.
Companies on both sides say there are limits to how far integration can go.
Cultural differences are one reason. Brazilians prefer two-door cars while
Argentines prefer four-door models; and emission standards are higher in
<LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>.
Economic differences have also led to problems. <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> boasts a growing
economy, with inflation running at an annual rate of 7.4 per cent last year,
but an overvalued peso. <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> is plagued by annual inflation of 2,500 per
cent and an undervalued currency. This has led to Argentine claims that
<LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> is dumping products, an accusation hotly denied by the Brazilians.
Trade in services is still underdeveloped and faces restrictive government
rules which hinder foreign access to markets. A body to resolve trade
disputes, perhaps similar to the European Court, has been delayed because it
raised the sensitive issue of diminished sovereignty.
A very poor communications infrastructure is also a constraint. There are no
rail connections because each country has a different gauge. Goods therefore
have to be moved via often poor road networks, especially on the Argentine
side, and bureaucratic customs procedures. Lorry drivers usually have to
wait at the border for a day for paperwork to be processed. Because of
different rules on truck sizes, haulage companies have to swap trucks at the
border.
As with the free-trade agreement, progress towards tackling these
constraints is likely to be slow. Nevertheless, businessmen such as <PERSON>Mr De
Smedt</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Autolatina</LOCATION> are optimistic that solutions will emerge in the long
term and free trade will blossom. 'There is a positive trend. We feel there
is a willingness at government level to make it happen. The timing is not
certain but let's hope they manage it by the deadline,' he says.

<TEXT>
   <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> resumed
direct air links <DATE>Saturday</DATE> for the first time since the <DATE>1982</DATE>
Falkland Islands War, the latest in a series of moves to
re-establish their historically strong ties.
   An <ORGANIZATION>Aerolineas Argentinas</ORGANIZATION> flight took off from <LOCATION>Buenos Aires</LOCATION>
<DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>evening</TIME>, and a <ORGANIZATION>British Airways</ORGANIZATION> jetliner left <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> 2{
hours later en route to this South American capital. Both were to
arrive <DATE>Sunday</DATE>.
   ``We're planning a little celebration'' for the arriving British
airliner, said <PERSON>Ian Gillespie</PERSON>, regional manager for <ORGANIZATION>British Airways</ORGANIZATION>.
``Six pipers from the <ORGANIZATION>Buenos Aires St. Andrews Society</ORGANIZATION> of the <ORGANIZATION>River
Plate</ORGANIZATION> will pipe the passengers off.''
   The two countries severed relations after <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> invaded the
<LOCATION>South Atlantic</LOCATION> islands, claiming it inherited the archipelago from
<LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> upon declaring independence in <DATE>1810</DATE>.
   Britain counterattacked and recovered the sparsely populated
territory of sheepherders and fishermen, which it has ruled since
<DATE>1833</DATE>.
   The issue of sovereignty blocked talks for years. Since taking
office in <DATE>July</DATE>, President <PERSON>Carlos Menem</PERSON> backed improved ties with
<LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> and temporarily set aside _ without giving up <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>'s
claim _ the issue of ownership.
   Trade and travel restrictions were lifted 9nOctober. Interest
sections were upgraded to consulates last month. Shipping ties
resumed earlier this month.
   Talks set for <DATE>February</DATE> in <LOCATION>Madrid</LOCATION> will mark ``a decisive stage
toward renewing diplomatic relations between <LOCATION>Great Britain</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>,'' <PERSON>Menem</PERSON> said last week.
   <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> was once one of <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>'s main trading partners, with
substantial landholdings and interests in the South American
county's meatpacking industry.
   By resuming direct flights, <ORGANIZATION>Aerolineas</ORGANIZATION>' Britain-bound flights
will continue to <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> from <LOCATION>Madrid</LOCATION>, where passengers had been
dropped off and picked up by <ORGANIZATION>British Airways</ORGANIZATION>.
   British Airways' Argentina-bound flights will continue to <ORGANIZATION>Buenos
Aires</ORGANIZATION> from <ORGANIZATION>Rio de Janeiro</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Sao Paolo</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>, where passengers
had been dropped off an4 Licked up by <ORGANIZATION>Aerolineas</ORGANIZATION>.
   Nonstop direct flights will be possible when <ORGANIZATION>Boeing</ORGANIZATION> 747-400s are
brought into service, <PERSON>Gillespie</PERSON> said. He said about 25,000
passengers fly the route each year.

<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> agreed <DATE>Thursday</DATE> to
restore full diplomatic relations nearly eight years after they
fought a 74-day war over the <LOCATION>Falkland Islands</LOCATION>.
   After two days of talks in <LOCATION>Madrid</LOCATION>, the announcement was read in
Spanish by Lucio del Solar, ambassador at large for <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>, and
in English by Sir <PERSON>Crispin Tickell</PERSON>, British ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION>United
Nations</ORGANIZATION>.
   <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> agreed to lift a 150-mile military protection zone it
has enforced around the <LOCATION>South Atlantic</LOCATION> islands since a task force
sent by Prime Minister <PERSON>Margaret Thatcher</PERSON> defeated Argentine
invaders in <DATE>June 1982</DATE>.
   New security arrangements for the archipelago 300 miles off
<LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>'s southeast coast, which are home to about 1,900 people
and thousands of sheep, are to involve advance notice by both sides
of military maneuvers in the area.
   The presence of an estimated 2,000 British soldiers at <LOCATION>Mount
Pleasant</LOCATION> outside <LOCATION>Port Stanley</LOCATION>, the Falklands capital, was not
mentioned in <DATE>Thursday</DATE>'s agreement, although <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> had
previously called for a reduction.
   <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> also agreed to consult on relations
between the <ORGANIZATION>European Economic Community</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Latin America</LOCATION>, and to
establish a <ORGANIZATION>Working Group on South Atlantic Affairs</ORGANIZATION>.
   In <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd</ORGANIZATION> said of the agreement:
``It underlines the fact that we have no quarrel with <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>,
and this has been achieved without any sacrifice of sovereignty. So
it's a very good agreement and I hope it's a turning point and will
lead to a new relationship.''
   President <PERSON>Carlos Menem</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> told reporters in Buenos
Aires: ``Everything is resolved. Aside from having eliminated _
definitively, I believe _ the possibilities of an armed conflict,
it opens wide possibilities for us in the ... <ORGANIZATION>European Economic
Community</ORGANIZATION>.''
   <PERSON>Javier Perez de Cuellar</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> secretary-general, declared:
``I very much welcome the decision by both governments to
re-establish diplomatic relations. This immediately creates an
atmosphere of confidence.''
   The battle for the <LOCATION>South Atlantic</LOCATION> islands, which <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> calls
the <LOCATION>Malvinas</LOCATION>, cost the lives of 712 Argentines, 255 Britons and
three islanders. Dissatisfaction over the war, which <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>'s
military government claimed to be winning until shortly before the
surrender, contributed to the end in <DATE>1983 of nearly eight years</DATE> of
military rule.
   <DATE>Thursday</DATE>'s agreement stiplulated that talks would continue on
fishing rights and that the <ORGANIZATION>International Red Cross</ORGANIZATION> would arrange
visits by Argentines to war cemeteries in the <LOCATION>Falklands</LOCATION>.
   Garcia del Solar called the accord ``very satisfactory,'' and
<PERSON>Tickell</PERSON> said the decision to end the military zone by the end of
<DATE>March</DATE> ``set a new base for relations between our two countries.''
   ``There is no secret understanding, no confidential
memorandum,'' he said. ``It's all here.''
   A breakthrough in <DATE>October</DATE> provide for renewed consular ties,
resumption of air and maritime links and moves toward lifting all
trade restrictions.
   By mutual consent, the latest talks did not touch on sovereignty
claims.
   <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> says it colonized the islands in <DATE>1766</DATE> when <PERSON>John MacBride</PERSON>
founded <LOCATION>Port Egmont</LOCATION>. <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> gained control but permitted the British
to remain until <DATE>1774</DATE>, then abandoned the islands when it ceased to
govern <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> in <DATE>1810</DATE>.
   <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> traces its claim in the Treaty of <LOCATION>Tordesillas</LOCATION>, which
assigned New World territories to <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION> in <DATE>1494</DATE>. It
says the British occupied the islands by force in <DATE>1833</DATE> when Capt.
<PERSON>John Onslow</PERSON> expelled the Argentine population.

FT  17 DEC 92 / British Gas wins Argentine deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER, Latin America Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CONSORTIUM led by British Gas yesterday bought the largest gas
distribution company in <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> in a privatisation auction in <ORGANIZATION>Buenos Aires</ORGANIZATION>
yesterday with a bid of just over Dollars 300m (Pounds 197m).
The bid for <ORGANIZATION>Distribuidora de Gas Metropolitana</ORGANIZATION>, which supplies 1.7m
consumers in <LOCATION>Buenos Aires</LOCATION>, values the company at just over Dollars 700m.
British Gas, which holds a leading 41 per cent stake in the consortium, will
take over management of the company by the month-end, installing <PERSON>Mr Rob
Varrion</PERSON>, a former regional operations director in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>, as general
manager.
<PERSON>Mr Peter Lehmann</PERSON>, director of British Gas's global gas division, said the
price 'was very reasonable for us and very fair for the government'.
The consortium, which includes the Argentine conglomerate <ORGANIZATION>Perez Companc</ORGANIZATION>,
will own 70 per cent of <ORGANIZATION>Metropolitana</ORGANIZATION> and is taking over its debts. A
majority of the rest will be sold to the public next year, with the
remainder held by employees.
The other gas distribution company in <LOCATION>Buenos Aires</LOCATION>, Gas de <ORGANIZATION>Buenos Aires
Norte</ORGANIZATION>, supplying 850,000 consumers, was sold yesterday to <ORGANIZATION>Gas Natural</ORGANIZATION>, a
subsidiary of <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Repsol</ORGANIZATION>, for Dollars 155m.
The third-round auctions for the two companies complete the privatisation of
the state monopoly, Gas del Estado, split into eight distribution and two
transportation companies for sale. The sale valued the industry's assets at
more than Dollars 4bn, nearly double the minimum price.
<PERSON>Mr Charles Alexander</PERSON>, a director of <ORGANIZATION>NM Rothschild</ORGANIZATION>, adviser on the project,
said the privatisation had secured a 'very broad spread of investors in the
Argentine gas industry', with operators from <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Belgium</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> all emerging as winners.
The acquisition will double the size of British Gas's global gas division
from where it hopes to make 20 per cent of its profits by the end of the
decade.
Further investment in <LOCATION>Metropolitana</LOCATION> - which covers 21 per cent of the
country's population and which supplied 4.8bn cubic metres of gas in <DATE>1991</DATE> -
would be financed out of its turnover, British Gas has said. It is committed
to invest Dollars 103.7m over the next five years in the company.

<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> voted
<DATE>Thursday</DATE> to claim the <LOCATION>Falkland Islands</LOCATION>, eight years after losing a
war with <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> over the remote <LOCATION>South Atlantic</LOCATION> archipelago.
Britain immediately objected to the measure, which appeared to be
largely symbolic.
   The legislation, approved despite opposition by <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>'s
foreign ministry, declares the Falklands _ known in <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> as
the <LOCATION>Malvinas</LOCATION> _ to be part of the new Argentine province of <ORGANIZATION>Tierra
del Fuego</ORGANIZATION>. It also covers the Sandwich and <LOCATION>South Georgia</LOCATION> islands,
also British possessions.
   In <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION>British Foreign Office</ORGANIZATION>, speaking
on condition of anonymity, said: ``We don't accept this or any
other Argentinian claim to British territory.''
   The <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> has already approved the legislation, and President
<PERSON>Carlos Menem</PERSON> was expected to sign it.
   <PERSON>Menem</PERSON> said the measure ``does not signify that <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> recognize
our sovereignty, but rather, simply, that we ratified the Malvinas
are ours.''
   He added he did not expect the move to ``cause obstacles'' in
relations with <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>.
   <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> has held the Falklands since <DATE>1833</DATE>. In <DATE>1982</DATE>, <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> fought a 74-day war over the windswept islands, causing
the deaths of nearly 1,000 men.
   <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>'s ruling Peronist party had pushed for the inclusion
of the Falklands in the legislation creating the new province.
However, critics warned that the measure could backfire.
   They said the move could hamper <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>'s continuing claims of
sovereignty by giving credence to British arguments that <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>
might try to impose its will on the 1,900 islanders.
   The islanders are British subjects and say they prefer to remain
so.
   For seven years after the war, <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> refused to formally
declare a cessation of hostilities. Diplomatic ties were severed
and relations handled through third countries. Commerce, trade,
travel and investment declined.
   Improving ties was one of <PERSON>Menem</PERSON>'s top foreign policy goals after
he became president last <DATE>July</DATE>. Consulates were upgraded to
embassies, direct air travel resumed, and a military exclusion zone
around the islands lifted.
   <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> restored full diplomatic relations <DATE>Feb.
16</DATE>, following two days of talks between the two countries in <LOCATION>Madrid</LOCATION>.
   <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> agreed to lift a 150-mile military protection zone
enforced around the islands since <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> invaded them in <DATE>June
1982</DATE>.
   The agreement said new arrangements to ensure the security of
the islands would involve advance notice by both sides of military
maneuvers in the area.
   By mutual assent, their agreement did not touch on the two
countries' conflicting claims to the <LOCATION>Falklands</LOCATION>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>British Foreign Office</ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> said: ``The
recent progress made on British-Argentine relations was only
possible on the understanding that we were not willing to discuss
sovereignty. And we will be repeating our views via diplomatic
channels.''
   The new province was created in response to demands by Argentine
residents of the island of Tierra del Fuego for greater government
representation. It had been <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>'s lone territory.
   <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION> shares ownership of the island at the foot of <LOCATION>South
America</LOCATION>. The dividing line between <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> was extended
years ago through <ORGANIZATION>Tierra del Fuego</ORGANIZATION>.
   Under the measure, residents of the new province would elect a
governor, who is now appointed by the president. Representation in
the national <ORGANIZATION>Chamber of Deputies</ORGANIZATION> would double to four, and two
<ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> seats were to be alloted.
   The provincial capital is to be <LOCATION>Ushuaia</LOCATION>, 2,260 miles south of
<PERSON>Buenos Aires</PERSON> and the southernmost city in the world.

   Efforts to raise <MONEY>$1.95 billion</MONEY> of proposed international bank loans for <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> probably will be slowed by <ORGANIZATION>Citicorp</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Chase Manhattan Corp.</ORGANIZATION>'s recent massive additions to loan-loss reserves, bankers and analysts said. 

   The proposed new bank loans are part of a restructuring of <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>'s huge foreign debt negotiated last month. 
The agreement requires all of the country's creditor banks to contribute sums equal to <PERCENT>9%</PERCENT> of their medium-term and long-term Argentine loans outstanding as of <DATE>June 30, 1982</DATE>. 

   However, analysts and bankers said it will be harder to persuade many smaller banks to participate in these new loans, now that two of the largest <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> commercial banks are effectively admitting that many of their Latin American loans aren't valued at <MONEY>100 cents</MONEY> on the dollar. 

   "The new money is going to be a lot harder to gather," said <PERSON>Alan Stoga</PERSON>, a senior associate at <ORGANIZATION>Kissinger Associates Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a consulting firm. "(The extra reserves) have made it harder to maintain the fiction of the full value of most Latin American debt," he said. 

   The huge loan-loss reserve increases "won't be helpful for raising new money for big debtor countries," said an adviser to a major debtor country. 
But he said that the big banks' move "will be helpful in that it allows more flexibility" in debt management through debt-for-equity swaps and loan sales. 

   If the assembly of the Argentine loan is slow and difficult, relations between <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> and its creditors could become strained. 
Also, it's probable that large banks will end up providing proportionately more of the loans, while some small banks succeed in shirking their obligation to lend more to <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>, analysts say. 

   In what bankers see as an attempt to speed up banks' participation in new Argentine loans, <ORGANIZATION>Citicorp</ORGANIZATION>, which is heading the lending effort, will today announce that a recent <MONEY>$500 million</MONEY> World Bank loan for <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> will be co-financed by commercial banks, banking sources said. 
This means that commercial banks would lend <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> $500 million alongside the <ORGANIZATION>World Bank</ORGANIZATION>'s <MONEY>$500 million</MONEY>. 

   The commercial-bank money would be counted as part of the <MONEY>$1.95 billion</MONEY> of proposed bank loans for <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>. 
Commercial banks are usually more eager to lend to developing countries when their loans are made jointly with the <ORGANIZATION>World Bank</ORGANIZATION>. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Citicorp</ORGANIZATION> declined to comment. 

   Last week, <ORGANIZATION>Citicorp</ORGANIZATION> shocked the banking community when it added <MONEY>$3 billion</MONEY> to loan-loss reserves, citing problems with its loans to developing countries. 
Chase followed on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> by adding <MONEY>$1.6 billion</MONEY> to its loan-loss reserves. 
And several other big <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> banks are expected to take similar steps soon. 

   Most other big <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> banks are now trying to decide exactly how they should respond to these landmark moves, and are also trying to assess what such decisions mean for their developing-country debts, and for the proposed Argentine loan. 
"Obviously, what <ORGANIZATION>Citicorp</ORGANIZATION> and Chase have done is making banks chew (the Argentine loan) over a lot more," said one senior <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> banker. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Citicorp</ORGANIZATION> heads the committee of 11 major international banks that negotiates with <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> on behalf of the country's creditor banks. 
This committee of banks now is working with the Argentines to raise the new bank loans. 

   The five <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> bank committee members -- <ORGANIZATION>BankAmerica Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Citicorp</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Chase Manhattan</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Manufacturers Hanover Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>J.P. Morgan &amp; Co.</ORGANIZATION> -- have all already pledged their shares of the new Argentine loans, banking sources said. 
These shares total about <MONEY>$400 million</MONEY>, according to the sources. 

   The <MONEY>$1.95 billion</MONEY> of new bank loans for <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> is made up of a medium-term bank loan of <MONEY>$1.55 billion</MONEY> and a trade credit and deposit facility of <MONEY>$400 million</MONEY>. 
The <MONEY>$500 million</MONEY> commercial-bank portion of the financing with the <ORGANIZATION>World Bank</ORGANIZATION> will come out of bank contributions to the medium-term bank loan, banking sources said. 

   The proposed Argentine debt accord negotiated last month already offers commercial banks new lending options, including provisions for debt-for-equity swaps, and for so-called exit bonds which allow banks to sell as much as <MONEY>$5 million</MONEY> of their Argentine loans. 
These new features were prompted by the difficulty in gathering <MONEY>$7.7 billion</MONEY> of new bank loans for <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>, which were finally signed earlier this year. 
Several smaller creditor banks never joined in these loans.

   The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>World Bank</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>International Monetary Fund</ORGANIZATION> rallied around <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>'s new economic-reform program with short-term loan money and expressed their willingness to lend more. 

   As expected, the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Treasury</ORGANIZATION> announced that it is putting together a short-term bridge loan of as much as <MONEY>$500 million</MONEY> to tide <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> over until it receives pending loans from the <ORGANIZATION>World Bank</ORGANIZATION>. 

   <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> late <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> announced an austerity program to control its budget deficit and soaring inflation. 
The government said it devalued the austral, its currency, against the dollar by <PERCENT>11.42%</PERCENT> as part of the program. 
Based on foreign-exchange rates quoted in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, the devaluation appears to be <PERCENT>12.9%</PERCENT>. 

   The measures, broadcast from <PERSON>Buenos Aires</PERSON> at the end of a government-decreed three-day bank holiday, should help <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> reach new loan agreements with its international creditors, and drew support from the <ORGANIZATION>World Bank</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>IMF</ORGANIZATION>. 

   The success of <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>'s austerity program will be crucial to the fate of the ruling Radical party in next <DATE>May</DATE>'s presidential election. 
The Radical candidate faces strong opposition from the populist Peronist candidate. 

   The bridge loan would come from the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and other creditor countries, and likely would total between <MONEY>$400 million</MONEY> and <MONEY>$500 million</MONEY>, officials said. 
The loan would be extended once the <ORGANIZATION>World Bank</ORGANIZATION> approves the details of the reform program and would be repaid to the lending governments from <ORGANIZATION>World Bank</ORGANIZATION> loans to <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>, probably late this year. 

   The <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>'s reform efforts "should help stabilize its economy and promote sustained growth." 
The <ORGANIZATION>IMF</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>World Bank</ORGANIZATION> indicated they would lend <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> new money in coming months. 

   World Bank President <PERSON>Barber Conable</PERSON> said the bank will send a delegation to <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> next week to review the measures. 
If the bank approves the details, the bridge loan would go forward, and the <ORGANIZATION>World Bank</ORGANIZATION> loans would be completed. 
A bank spokesman said details of those loans won't be known until the delegation completes its work. 

   The <ORGANIZATION>IMF</ORGANIZATION> said it is now "ready to formulate with <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> a new standby arrangement," which would signal to lenders that the debt-troubled country's reforms are considered effective. 
An <ORGANIZATION>IMF</ORGANIZATION> accord would be accompanied by the about <MONEY>$1.2 billion</MONEY> in new loans <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> has requested. 
Such an accord also should spur commercial banks to agree to a new lending package. 

   Announcing the measures, Economy Minister <PERSON>Juan V. Sourrouille</PERSON> said industrial leaders agreed to limit price increases to a maximum of <PERCENT>5%</PERCENT> until <DATE>Sept. 30</DATE>, and that further price restaints would continue after that. 
Government employees will get a <PERCENT>25%</PERCENT> pay increase to offset <DATE>July</DATE>'s high inflation. 

   Argentine industry also has been given an extra incentive to export, as it will be allowed to sell goods abroad at an exchange rate between the controlled and financial rates for the austral, <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>'s currency. 
But the measures decree that much more of the nation's trade should be conducted at financial-market rates, which are close to the free-market rate. 
The government said it is considering ending its two-tier exchange-rate system next year in favor of a free-market rate. 

   After the devaluation, there are now 12 australs to the dollar at the controlled rate and about 14.4 australs to the dollar at the financial rate, news reports from <PERSON>Buenos Aires</PERSON> said.

@  U.S. Is Attempting to Nudge Argentina
@  And Britain Toward a Reconciliation

<TEXT>
   The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, sensing the time is right for a reconciliation between <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>, is nudging them to try to mend their fences. 

   <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> helped persuade <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>, which fought a 10-week war in <DATE>1982</DATE> over the <LOCATION>Falkland Islands</LOCATION>, to discuss their bilateral relations in recent meetings in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. 
The two countries are now set to hold further talks in <LOCATION>Madrid</LOCATION> in <DATE>October</DATE>, which may lead to a restoration of diplomatic relations. 

   Previous bilateral talks stalled because <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> is unwilling to discuss <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>'s claim to sovereignty over the islands -- which Latin Americans usually call the <LOCATION>Malvinas</LOCATION> -- and other smaller British island possessions in the <LOCATION>South Atlantic</LOCATION>. 
But the recent negotiations are continuing because both sides agreed to the proposal of <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>'s new foreign minister, <PERSON>Domingo Cavallo</PERSON>, that the issue of sovereignty should "be placed under an umbrella" -- or left to one side -- at least until the two countries have restored relations. 

   On <DATE>Friday</DATE>, in a further conciliatory gesture to <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> said it wouldn't this year submit its annual motion to the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION> calling on <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> to negotiate the future of the islands. 
After the war, <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> won increasing support for this motion from the international community, but in the past two years that backing has dwindled a little, perhaps because it seemed to have little effect on the impasse between the two countries. 

   The time is ripe for some restoration of Anglo-Argentine relations, as both nations have their own particular reasons for wanting them to improve. 
In recent interviews, <PERSON>Mr. Cavallo</PERSON> has said that <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>'s new government is eager for better relations with <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> and the international community, particularly now when his country is wrestling with difficult economic problems. 

   In the past, <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> has caused problems for <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> in international organizations such as the <ORGANIZATION>International Monetary Fund</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>World Bank</ORGANIZATION>, according to <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and Argentine officials. 
The support of these institutions is important to <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>'s attempts to come to grips with its economic problems, and particularly to secure further international loans. 

   <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> also would like to gain better access to the rich fishing grounds near the <LOCATION>Falkland Islands</LOCATION>. 
<LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> has maintained a 150-mile exclusion zone and fishing limit around the islands since the <DATE>1982</DATE> conflict. 

   <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>, for its part, has long wanted <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> to declare an end to the hostilities, which the Latin American country has never done. 
Some analysts expect that such a move would be the quid pro quo for removing the 150-mile exclusion zone. 

   However, the fishing limit would still pose a thorny problem. 
Under current British regulations, even if the exclusion zone were removed, Argentine ships would have to obtain licenses to fish in the area. 
But acquiring such a license would require <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> to recognize -- at least implicitly -- British sovereignty over the islands. 

   An improvement in Anglo-Argentine relations probably would help <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s relations with other Latin American countries, and could well reduce the high costs that <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> pays to fortify the islands against possible future conflicts. 

   Even the Argentine military has reasons for wanting to reach an accommodation with its former enemy. 
"They want more access to arms and spare parts," said a senior Latin American official. 

   The <ORGANIZATION>Argentine Navy</ORGANIZATION> has been starved of spare parts for its British-built ships, and would like to regain access to suppliers in the <LOCATION>U.K.</LOCATION> 

   Meanwhile, the Argentine army believes better relations with <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> could result in its receiving a greater share of <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>'s military budget. 
Currently, the budget channels more resources to the <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION>, which would be the country's main force in any further potential struggle for the islands. 
If relations with <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> improve, more funds might be diverted to the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION>, which would be the country's prime force in any potential falling out with <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>'s other likely foreign adversary. 

   <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION> have long disputed their extreme southern border near <LOCATION>Tierra del Fuego</LOCATION>, the southernmost tip of <LOCATION>Latin America</LOCATION>. 

   <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>'s interest in all this is that it doesn't like to see conflict between two important allies. 
The <DATE>1982</DATE> war placed the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> in a difficult position. 
The disclosure that it had provided some satellite intelligence to the British distanced the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> from <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> and other Latin American countries that passively supported the Argentine attempt to seize the islands. 
The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> also hopes that an improvement in relations with <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> could help <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> rebuild foreign trade and investment.

<TEXT>
MS <ORGANIZATION>Zelia Cardoso de Mello</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>'s economy minister, has signed a Dollars
350m (Pounds 205.8m) loan agreement with the <ORGANIZATION>Inter-American Development Bank</ORGANIZATION>
(IADB), writes <PERSON>Stephen Fidler</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>.
The loan, to improve urban sanitation, will create about 45,000 jobs. It had
been delayed because of <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> concern over <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>'s growing arrears with
commercial banks.
The loan was approved by the bank's board last week, following an agreement
in principle last month with leading bank creditors over the arrears. Ms
Cardoso yesterday met <PERSON>Mr Michel Camdessus</PERSON>, managing director of the
<ORGANIZATION>International Monetary Fund</ORGANIZATION>.
She told journalists she hoped <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> could 'start as soon as possible'
negotiations over its external debt and hoped the <ORGANIZATION>IMF</ORGANIZATION> and other institutions
would provide 'necessary support' for the process.
Asked about the possibility of debt relief for <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> from creditor
governments, she said she did not want to anticipate any proposal - which
would have, in any case, to follow agreement with the <ORGANIZATION>IMF</ORGANIZATION>. However, <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>
applauded the decision to write off at least 50 per cent of <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION>'s debts
and said the treatment 'should be extended to other middle- and low-income
countries'.
The <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> have agreed to lead a support group of countries friendly
to <LOCATION>Peru</LOCATION> to help it erase its Dollars 2.1bn in arrears to the <ORGANIZATION>IMF</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>World Bank</ORGANIZATION>
and <ORGANIZATION>Inter-American Development Bank</ORGANIZATION>. This would allow borrowing from the
institutions to resume.
Agreement came at a meeting on <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME> in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Mr Camdessus</PERSON>
said another meeting would take place in <DATE>May</DATE>, at which other countries
friendly to <LOCATION>Peru</LOCATION> would be present, to take the issue forward.
The size of the arrears in relation to <LOCATION>Peru</LOCATION>'s resources complicates the
problem. <PERSON>Mr Camdessus</PERSON> also said he hoped the <ORGANIZATION>IMF</ORGANIZATION> would provide support for
programmes in <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>.

   The foreign minister said <DATE>Thursday</DATE>
he will meet with his British counterpart next week in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> to
discuss restoring diplomatic and commercial ties severed at the
outbreak of the <DATE>1982</DATE> Falkland Islands war.
   It would be the first meeting between Argentine and British
foreign ministers since the 74-day war in the <LOCATION>South Atlantic</LOCATION>, which
left dead nearly 1,000 people.
   Foreign Minister <PERSON>Domingo Cavallo</PERSON> said his meeting with Foreign
Secretary <PERSON>John Major</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> will take place <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> at <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION>
headquarters in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>.
   Cavallo will fly to <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> on <DATE>Saturday</DATE> with President <PERSON>Carlos
Menem</PERSON>, who is scheduled to address the <ORGANIZATION>U.N. General Assembly</ORGANIZATION>.
   Argentine and British diplomats are scheduled to meet <DATE>Oct. 17-18</DATE>
in <LOCATION>Madrid</LOCATION> to discuss renewing diplomatic and trade relations.
   Such a move would in effect set aside for now the dispute
stemming from their rival claims of sovereignty over the <LOCATION>Falklands</LOCATION>.
   The islands off <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> have been ruled by <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> since <DATE>1833</DATE>.
<LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> claims it inherited the territory, which it calls the
<LOCATION>Malvinas</LOCATION>, when it declared independence from <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> in <DATE>1810</DATE>.
   <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> invaded the islands, inhabited by about 1,800 people of
British descent, on <DATE>April 2, 1982</DATE>. Britain counterattacked and
defeated <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> in a war that helped contribute to the downfall
of the military junta that ruled from <DATE>1976</DATE> until <PERSON>Raul Alfonsin</PERSON> was
elected president in <DATE>1983</DATE>.
   Alfonsin, who by law could not run for re-election, was succeeded
in <DATE>July</DATE> by <PERSON>Menem</PERSON>, who defeated <PERSON>Alfonsin</PERSON>'s candidate, <LOCATION>Cordoba</LOCATION> Gov.
<PERSON>Eduardo Angeloz</PERSON>, in the general election.

FT  27 MAY 93 / Survey of Argentina (8): Diplomatic talks go on - The
Falkland Islands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<LOCATION>ARGENTINA</LOCATION> is obsessed with the <LOCATION>Falkland Islands</LOCATION>. Eleven years after its
defeat in the 74-day conflict with <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>, the country's overriding foreign
policy aim is winning sovereignty over the islands.
In every important speech, President <PERSON>Carlos Menem</PERSON> makes a ritual reference
to <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>'s sovereignty over the <LOCATION>Falklands</LOCATION>. He claims his policy of
rapprochement - rather than confrontation - with <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> will enable
<LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> to 'recover' sovereignty over the islands by <DATE>2000</DATE>.
<PERSON>Mr Menem</PERSON> said: 'We will continue talking. In the world of diplomacy one
needs great patience. There is no possibility of taking this conflict over
the <LOCATION>Falklands</LOCATION> to a situation similar to <DATE>1982</DATE>.'
His aim is to draw the UK into as close a relationship as possible. Stronger
trade and investment links with <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> would gradually reduce the
importance of the <LOCATION>Falklands</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>. Eventually, <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> will have
sufficient confidence in <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> to consider transferring sovereignty.
Several British companies already operate privatised utilities in <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>.
But instead of receding, the Falklands question remains an open sore in
bilateral relations.
<LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> continually presses for greater involvement in developing the
natural resources. In <DATE>1991</DATE> the <ORGANIZATION>UK</ORGANIZATION> agreed to co-operate to conserve
fisheries. Last year <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> began to issue fishing licences, muscling in
on the main source of revenue.
Ordinary Argentines are frustrated that <PERSON>Mr Menem</PERSON>'s policy has still not led
to any talks over the crucial issue of sovereignty. <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> has remained
unyielding in its insistence that co-operation with <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> does not imply
any recognition of its claim to the islands. The UK foreign office says this
policy will change only if and when the islands' fewer than 2,000
inhabitants agree to a change in their status.
Last month, <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> suffered another diplomatic slap in the face when
<LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> announced it would extend territorial waters to 200 miles around the
remote and uninhabited <LOCATION>South Georgia</LOCATION> and South Sandwich island groups, which
<LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> also claims.
Oil is emerging as another source of friction. The Falklands are believed to
have big oil and gas deposits and <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> wants to tie <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> into a
joint oil regime. <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> has ignored <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>'s arguments, and last year
licensed two companies to carry out seismic exploration in two blocks around
the islands. <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> refuses to discuss oil co-operation until studies
confirm the region does have hydrocarbon reserves in commercial quantities.
There is scant chance of a shift in the islanders' virulently anti-Argentine
attitudes. Memories of <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>'s three-month military occupation remain
fresh.
And <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> has still not lifted its arms embargo on <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>. <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> has
also successfully persuaded <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> not to sell two squadrons of ageing
Skyhawk fighter bombers to <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>. However, talks are planned later this
year to resume training courses for Argentine officers at British military
academies.

<HEAD>New Long-Term Conditions Set For Argentinian Loans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>An AP News Analysis</BYLINE>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new, long-term way of dealing with the <ORGANIZATION>Third
World</ORGANIZATION>'s crippling <MONEY>$1.2 trillion</MONEY> debt may be foreshadowed by <MONEY>$700
million</MONEY> worth of new loans the <ORGANIZATION>World Bank</ORGANIZATION> is offering to <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>.
   On the surface, <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> seems a poor prospect for more loans.
   It already owes more than <MONEY>$49 billion</MONEY>, the biggest debt of any
Third World country after <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>.
   It should be paying <MONEY>$4.5 billion</MONEY> this year in interest alone,
and already is about <MONEY>$1 billion</MONEY> behind in its payments. With
interest rates rising, the bill may be <MONEY>$1 billion</MONEY> higher next year.
   The financial world is so skeptical about the prospects for
repayment that Argentine loans can be bought for less than <MONEY>22 cents</MONEY>
on the dollar.
   Finance Minister <PERSON>Juan Sourrouille</PERSON> says he hopes to pay half the
interest out of the country's own earnings. The rest he will have
to borrow, presumably from many of the same banks that lent the
original money.
   President <PERSON>Raul Alfonsin</PERSON>'s government, the first one freely
elected after years of military rule, faces an election in <DATE>1989</DATE>.
Many of his opponents, who are given an excellent chance to succeed
him, are talking about suspending interest payments altogether.
   Yet the 151 governments in the <ORGANIZATION>World Bank</ORGANIZATION> probably will approve
the new loans next month. The bank's sister organization, the
<ORGANIZATION>International Monetary Fund</ORGANIZATION>, has been negotiating all <DATE>summer</DATE> with
the Argentine government to make another <MONEY>$1.2 billion</MONEY> in loans.
Sourrouille says negotiations should be completed in a couple of
weeks, and he then will know how much to ask from the commercial
banks _ probably more than <MONEY>$1 billion</MONEY>.
   Why all this new lending? It has a lot to do with an old
banker's saying:
   ``Lend a man a thousand dollars and he's in your power; lend him
a million and you're in his.''
   The lenders keep on lending in the hope that <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> and the
other big debtors will use the money wisely, investing in new
factories and farm equipment so they can earn more money from their
exports and catch up with their bills. It's called ``growing out of
financial difficulties.''
   The lenders, all represented at the current fund and bank
meetings in <LOCATION>Berlin</LOCATION>, see no other choice. The fund says the strategy
is working well, and that the debtors' exports are growing faster
than their debts.
   New loans are given under conditions usually tied to economic
policies. If the borrower fails to meet them, the disbursements are
cut off.
   Traditionally, the <ORGANIZATION>IMF</ORGANIZATION> has taken the lead in setting the
conditions, providing a ``seal of approval'' for other creditors.
But the fund was set up originally to deal with short-term currency
problems. The <ORGANIZATION>World Bank</ORGANIZATION> is intended to aid long-term development
of poor countries.
   <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> is considered a ``middle-income'' country, with
individual earnings averaging <MONEY>$2,370</MONEY> a year _ compared with <MONEY>$120</MONEY> in
<LOCATION>Ethiopia</LOCATION> and <MONEY>$21,250</MONEY> in <LOCATION>Switzerland</LOCATION>.
   But <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> has fallen on hard times and incomes have been
declining through the <DATE>1980s</DATE>. So the country is considered a
candidate for basic improvements.
   Now, for the first time, the <ORGANIZATION>World Bank</ORGANIZATION> has taken the lead in
setting conditions, and many of them are conditions on long-term
policy of a kind that the <ORGANIZATION>IMF</ORGANIZATION> would not require.
   Sourrouille not only has promised to cut government spending
sharply, but also is undertaking other changes basic to his
country's economy.
   He has promised the <ORGANIZATION>World Bank</ORGANIZATION> he will strengthen the tax
administration, reducing tax evasion and improving collections. He
is attempting to improve the bank system, making the major public
banks self-sustaining rather than dependent on government
subsidies, and has promised new policies on trade and industry.
   There has been some grumbling. <PERSON>Nigel Lawson</PERSON>, the British
chancellor of the exchequer, has warned against easing the
conditions for loans.
   The <ORGANIZATION>World Bank</ORGANIZATION> accord with <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> reportedly made some <ORGANIZATION>IMF</ORGANIZATION>
people furious. But <PERSON>Michel Camdessus</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>IMF</ORGANIZATION> managing director,
welcomed the agreement publicly.
   <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> and the fund are expected to agree on further
conditions. Commercial banks presumably will come in with their
loans, including new money for investment in <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>. The hope is
that the new policies will put the country back on the road to the
kind of prosperity it enjoyed before World War II.
   If they do, the new leadership by the <ORGANIZATION>World Bank</ORGANIZATION> may furnish a
model for other countries in long-term trouble.

  [Text] <PERSON>Buenos Aires</PERSON>, 26 Apr (EFE) -- It was reported today 
that the businesses and investments of <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>, 
<LOCATION>Paraguay</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Uruguay</LOCATION> -- which make up Mercosur [Common Market 
of the South] -- are concentrated in one fourth of the regional 
integration project's vast territory. 
  According to a survey conducted by the <ORGANIZATION>Deloitte</ORGANIZATION>, Touch, and 
<ORGANIZATION>Simonsen Associates</ORGANIZATION> company of <ORGANIZATION>Buenos Aires</ORGANIZATION>, 250 enterprises and 
financial companies with important businesses within <ORGANIZATION>Mercosur</ORGANIZATION> 
are concentrating their main activities in <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>. 
  The analysts confirmed that the "real Mercosur," the most 
interesting entrepreneurial area due to its economic potential, 
involves 110 million inhabitants with an average income of 
<MONEY>$5,000</MONEY> per year. 
  The "real Mercosur" has a GDP of some <MONEY>$550 billion</MONEY>, compared 
with the <MONEY>$726 billion</MONEY> of the complete territory of the four 
member countries which have a total population of 198 million 
persons. 
  The area where there is the greatest business interest has 
the form of a stylized S with the apex in <PERSON>Belo Horizonte</PERSON> 
(<LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>), while its other point is in the Argentine province of 
<LOCATION>Mendoza</LOCATION> on the border with <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>. 
  This includes all of <LOCATION>Uruguay</LOCATION>, two thirds of <LOCATION>Paraguay</LOCATION> -- on 
its borders with <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> -- and the wealthier 
regions of <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>. 
  The centers that have a very large economic potential

Article Type:BFN 

  [Text] <PERSON>Domingo Cavallo</PERSON> has taken the first step in a 
campaign to encourage exports in order to reduce the trade 
balance deficit. Yesterday, the minister announced new credit 
lines to finance exports by small- and medium-sized companies. 
The amount available is <MONEY>$100 million</MONEY> at an annual interest rate 
of between 8 and <PERCENT>10 percent</PERCENT>. 
  The minister used a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION>Argentine Industrial 
Union</ORGANIZATION> 
[UIA] to announce the plan. <ORGANIZATION>UIA</ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON>Jorge Blanco Villegas</PERSON> 
took advantage of the opportunity to lash out at bankers, who 
were absent from yesterday's meeting. He said they were "one of 
the main sectors missing from government economic reorganization 
programs." 
  The loans will be channeled through the <ORGANIZATION>Bank of Investment 
and Foreign Trade</ORGANIZATION> (BICE), which is presided over by <PERSON>Horacio 
Alvarez Rivero</PERSON>. The main points of this new credit line are: 

  -  The loan will finance up to <PERCENT>85 percent</PERCENT> of the FOB value of 
capital good exports of national origin and up to <PERCENT>10 percent</PERCENT> of 
the <ORGANIZATION>FOB</ORGANIZATION> value of spare parts and accessories. 
  -  The minimum loan 
is <MONEY>$20,000</MONEY> and the maximum is <MONEY>$2.5 million</MONEY> per year. 
  -  The 
interest rate varies from <PERCENT>8 percent</PERCENT> a year for shorter terms 
(from six months to two years) to <PERCENT>10 percent</PERCENT> for longer terms 
(three to five years). 
  -  All financial institutions that operate 
trade internationally with the authorization of the <ORGANIZATION>BICE</ORGANIZATION> may 
play the role of commercial banks. The banks will get a maximum 
profit, or spread [preceding word in English] of <PERCENT>1.5 percent</PERCENT>, 
which is already included in the rate. 
  -  The guarantees can be 
presented through an export credit insurance against special 
risks and regular commercial risks. The endorsement of foreign 
banks approved by the <ORGANIZATION>BICE</ORGANIZATION> can also be used. 
  <PERSON>Alvarez Rivero</PERSON> also presented a second line of credit to 
finance Argentine companies participation in international fairs 
and congresses. The idea is to cover up to <PERCENT>70 percent</PERCENT> of the 
cost of renting stands, publishing catalogs, and paying for 
trips and hotels. 
  With this package -- in addition to the Competitivity Plan 
to 
be disclosed next week -- Cavallo seeks to stimulate exports. 
The <DATE>1993</DATE> trade deficit was over <MONEY>$3.5 billion</MONEY>. 
  Cavallo said: "We want all <DATE>1995</DATE> foreign trade activities to 
enjoy international financing." 
  <PERSON>Blanco Villegas</PERSON>, who is also the president of <LOCATION>Philco</LOCATION>, was 
skeptical about <ORGANIZATION>Cavallo</ORGANIZATION>'s promises. He said: "I believe the 
financial sector has not made enough effort. We must exert 
pressure and stimulation to broaden credit and to reduce 
production costs." 
  The few businessmen who are members of the APYME [<ORGANIZATION>Small and 
Medium Enterprises Association</ORGANIZATION>] who came to hear the 
announcement were disappointed. One said: "This is not the 
first time we have heard announcements of this type." Workers 
of the INTI [<ORGANIZATION>National Institute of Industrial Technology</ORGANIZATION>] were 
also disappointed. They gathered outside to wait for the 
secretary of industry to protest the reorganization of this 
secretariat, but <PERSON>Carlos Magarinos</PERSON> did not attend the meeting 
because he is touring the country.

<TEXT>
   After seven years of silence, <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> began talks aimed at normalizing diplomatic
and trade relations that were severed after the <DATE>1982</DATE> Falklands War.
   <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> ambassador, Sir <PERSON>Crispin Tickell</PERSON>, met <PERSON>Lucio Garcia</PERSON>
del Solar, director-general of <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Foreign Ministry</ORGANIZATION>, to
``seek to establish the conditions and agenda for direct talks
between the <LOCATION>United Kingdom</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>,'' according to <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s
<ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> mission.
   The mission said the meetings ``will be without prejudice to the
sovereignty positions of either side regarding the <LOCATION>Falkland
Islands</LOCATION>.''
   The talks opened <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> but no details on the times and
locations were disclosed. An official communique is expected after
they conclude <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   Although the dialogue is not taking place under <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> auspices,
``it is an encouraging development that Secretary-General <PERSON>Javier
Perez de Cuellar</PERSON> welcomes,'' said his spokesman, <PERSON>Francois Giuliani</PERSON>.
   <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>'s new president, <PERSON>Carlos Saul Menem</PERSON>, made the dialogue
possible when he dropped his country's insistence that <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>'s
claim to the islands it calls the Malvinas be the first step in any
talks.
   A meeting between British and Argentine government officials in
<LOCATION>Bern</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Switzerland</LOCATION>, in <DATE>July 1984</DATE> broke down when <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> raised the
sovereignty issue as a precondition.
   In <DATE>April 1982</DATE>, <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> invaded the islands, where 2,000 people
of British descent live. Britain counterattacked and defeated
<LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> in a six-week war that cost nearly 1,000 lives.
   Britain cut ties with <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> and has said it will never
negotiate sovereignty of the islands, where the population has
expressed almost unanimous preference for continuing their colonial
relationship with <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>.
   <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> have held indirect talks through the <LOCATION>United
States</LOCATION> on such issues as fish conservation.
   Menem's government would like to recover fishing rights in the
area around the <LOCATION>Falklands</LOCATION>. Britain currently enforces a 150-mile
exclusion zone, steering Argentine vessels away from the area.
   Many nations fish in the areas just outside the exclusion zone,
largely unregulated, and <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> would like to reach
an accord on regulating fishing in the south <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION>.
   Both countries have lifted bans on importing each others'
products, with <PERSON>Buenos Aires</PERSON> taking the step this month. <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>
lifted its ban in <DATE>1985</DATE>.
   Diplomats said <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> is also looking ahead to the unified
<ORGANIZATION>European Community</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1992</DATE> and realizes it must mend fences with
<LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>, which will be one of the major members of the new
Euromarket, the largest trade bloc in the world.
   The <LOCATION>Falkland Islands</LOCATION> are 300 miles east of the <ORGANIZATION>Strait of Magellan</ORGANIZATION>.
   A British explorer sighted them in <DATE>1592</DATE>, and Britons landed on
them in <DATE>1690</DATE>. They have been under British rule since <DATE>1833</DATE>, but
<LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> claims it inherited the land when it declared independence
from <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> in <DATE>1810</DATE>.

<TEXT>
   British and Argentine officials are holding
talks this week on restoring diplomatic and trade relations for the
first time since the <DATE>1982</DATE> Falklands War, authorities said <DATE>Monday</DATE>.
   <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>'s willingness to temporarily set aside its claim over
the <LOCATION>Falkland Islands</LOCATION> led to the diplomatic breakthrough, officials
said, speaking with the condition of anonymity.
   None of the officials involved would provide details of the talks
under way in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>.
   But one diplomat said ``we cannot deny that the situation is very
dynamic, and something could happen in the next few days or weeks.''
   Diplomatic relations were severed in <DATE>April 1982</DATE> when <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>
invaded and occupied the <LOCATION>Falkland Islands</LOCATION>, a British colony since
<DATE>1833</DATE>. British forces recaptured the islands off <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>'s southern
coast in a 74-day war.
   Argentines call the islands the <LOCATION>Malvinas</LOCATION> and claim they inherited
them in <DATE>1810</DATE> after declaring independence from <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>.
   <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> never formally declared an end to hostilities in the
Falklands War. It has refused to allow British planes or ships to
use Argentine ports or to allow British companies to bid on
Argentine public projects.
   <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> also banned British products from its markets but
lifted restrictions earlier this month. Britain earlier removed a
similar ban on Argentine imports.
   <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> has said it wants to normalize trade relations with
<LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>, negotiate a fishing agreement, re-establish air links and
reduce tension.
   <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>'s new president, <PERSON>Carlos Menem</PERSON>, took the first step
toward restoring ties shortly after his inauguration in early <DATE>July</DATE>.
Previously, <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> had said talks would have to start with the
sovereignty issue.
   Menem's government would like to recover fishing rights in the
area around the <LOCATION>Falklands</LOCATION>. Britain currently enforces a 150-mile
exclusion zone around the islands.

   The <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Export-Import Bank</ORGANIZATION> eased restrictions on export credits to <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>. 

   The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> governmment export-credit agency said that starting <DATE>May 1</DATE> it will consider direct loans or guarantees of private credits with maturities of up to seven years to <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> for the purchase of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> goods and services. 
The bank stopped approving new credits and loan guarantees to <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> in <DATE>1982</DATE>, when the country got involved in a war with <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> over the <LOCATION>Falkland Islands</LOCATION>. 

   Last <DATE>December</DATE>, the bank decided to authorize credits and loan guarantees with maturities of one year or less to help <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> buy commodities and industrial equipment from <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> suppliers. 

   <PERSON>John Bohn</PERSON>, president of the Export-Import bank, said that while <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> is a "heavily debt-burdened" country, it also is a sizable market for <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> goods and services. 
He said "we are encouraged" by the Argentine government's economic-adjustment efforts. 

   <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> officials said the decision to ease restrictions on credits to <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> was prompted by the willingness of commercial banks to come to an agreement with the South American country on refinancing of its external debts. 
They said the action had nothing to do with the Argentine government's success in quelling a mutiny among some military officers over the weekend. 

   The bank currently has about <MONEY>$700 million</MONEY> in loans outstanding and guarantees covering earlier credits to <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>.

<LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>'s foreign ministry holds a privileged place in the country's capital,
<LOCATION>Brasilia</LOCATION> - overlooking the <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> building and opposite the <ORGANIZATION>Palace of
Justice</ORGANIZATION>. The location is deserved because the ministry, known as <ORGANIZATION>Itamaraty</ORGANIZATION>,
is one of the country's most able and important.
But it is a cruel punishment for the diplomats, who are forced each day to
look at the cause of their frustration - politicians. Despite <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>'s size
and potential, it is unable to play the international role many in Itamaraty
seek. Instead, its importance and negotiating strength are compromised by
the political failure to stabilise the economy and bring down inflation.
<LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>'s economic instability is also acting as a brake on the development
of Mercosul - the free-trade zone formed between <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Uruguay</LOCATION>
and <LOCATION>Paraguay</LOCATION> which is due to come into force on <DATE>January 1</DATE> - and plans for a
wider free trade area to incorporate most of <LOCATION>South America</LOCATION>. Mercosul has
progressed much faster than cynics first suggested. But longer-term
questions remain unanswered, and it would not be surprising if key partners
such as <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> chose to link with the <ORGANIZATION>US-led North American Free Trade
Agreement</ORGANIZATION> (<ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>) grouping, rather than remain tied to <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>'s bumpy ride.
<LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>'s cultural and trading ties have traditionally been with <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>,
original home to much of the country's population, and the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>, which emerged
as <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>'s biggest foreign investor early this century.
But the relationship with the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> is complicated, and often troubled.
Itamaraty is itself sometimes accused of being anti-American, although this
partly reflects the broad range of subjects where the two countries'
interests do not coincide. <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>'s concerns about a proposed linkage by the
<LOCATION>US</LOCATION> between social and environmental issues and trade is the latest example
of underlying tension.
Relations have improved this year, however, with the <ORGANIZATION>Brazilian Senate</ORGANIZATION>'s
approval of a treaty to allow inspections of some of its nuclear
installations and <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>'s acceptance of <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> demands on patents and
copyrights. Last month's completion of <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>'s foreign bank debt
restructuring, achieved without <ORGANIZATION>IMF</ORGANIZATION> blessing, also removed another stumbling
block.
But it is Mercosul, and <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>'s future within <LOCATION>South America</LOCATION>, where most
change is occuring. The Mercosul treaty, signed in <DATE>March 1991</DATE>, calls for a
customs union to be ready by next year through the implementation of a
common external tariff.
Tariffs have already been reduced on many goods, and trade within the group
has grown extremely rapidly - more than doubling since <DATE>1990</DATE> to about Dollars
8bn last year.
This partly reflects the complementary nature of the two biggest economies,
<LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>'s industrial strength being offset by <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>'s competitiveness as
a producer of primary products such as foodstuffs and oil.
Difficulties remain - for example, <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>'s desire to retain high tariffs to
protect its computer and telecommunications industries. As a result, the
common external tariff is likely to apply to only about 85 per cent of
products. Remaining goods will only be harmonised from <DATE>2001</DATE>.
<LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> is now proposing to use Mercosul as the base for a wider trade
agreement among all South American countries. This would be a simple free
trade agreement rather than a customs union, and would be jointly negotiated
by the Mercosul nations.
'We hope to use Mercosul as a platform for further trade liberalisation
throughout <LOCATION>South America</LOCATION>,' says Ambassador <PERSON>Jose Arthur Denot Medeiros</PERSON>, in
charge of Mercosul issues at <ORGANIZATION>Itamaraty</ORGANIZATION>.
<LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>'s economic dominance of the continent means that most countries will
be interested in joining, although <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>'s priority clearly lies in gaining
entry to <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>. Even if countries do not formally join, there is an
increasing move towards lower tariff barriers and more open trade.
<LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>'s position is more complicated, and at times the country
commitment to <ORGANIZATION>Mercosul</ORGANIZATION> has appeared in doubt as it contemplated its chances
of entry to <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>. Complaints by senior Argentine leaders about <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>'s
economic instability have also angered the Brazilian side. Argentine claims
of dumping against Brazilian companies are rebuffed by <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>'s suggestion
that the Argentine currency is overvalued.
Teething problems and tensions are hardly surprising, but they hide a
longer-term problem. <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>'s big industrial economy is far from ready to
compete within a US-led trade area such as <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>, suggesting that an
Americas-wide agreement is still many years away. But if more countries such
as <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION> opt for the <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION> model, there is a chance <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> will be
isolated.
Back at <ORGANIZATION>Itamaraty</ORGANIZATION>, the diplomats must hope the politicians sort out <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>'s
many other problems in time.

Its Position
On Paying Debt

It Tells Banks Not to Repay
Creditors Seeking Recall
Of Short-Term Credit

   <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> ordered its commercial banks not to repay foreign banks that seek to recall short-term credits and deposits at the Brazilian institutions. 

   The decision, communicated in a telex from the central bank, represents a hardening of <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>'s position. 
It came amid increasing signs in <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> that the new debt moratorium -- initially dismissed by some bankers as no more than a tough bargaining stance -- is in fact a carefully prepared and committed attempt to change the terms for discussion of <LOCATION>Latin America</LOCATION>'s huge debt. 

   In the telex, <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> said that if foreign banks ask for their money back, Brazilian banks should pay the funds to the central bank. 

   Foreign banks lend <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> about <MONEY>$15 billion</MONEY> in short-term trade credits and money-market deposits. 
The Brazilian government fears there might be a run on these credits and deposits following its unilateral suspension of interest payments on about <MONEY>$67 billion</MONEY> of foreign debt last <DATE>Friday</DATE>. 

   The measure, announced in a telex signed by <PERSON>Carlos Eduardo de Freitas</PERSON>, the director of the central bank's foreign department and Antonio de <PERSON>Padua Seixas</PERSON>, director of the bank's foreign-debt department, was aimed particularly at small and medium-sized <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> banks, Brazilian sources said. 
Some of these have already shown signs of wishing to cut the loans. 
Their severance -- the most obvious way they have of immediately retaliating to the moratorium -- could seriously disrupt the Brazilian economy, which is the eighth-largest in the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION>. 

   <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and international bankers were unhappy to learn of the move second-hand, through friends at Brazilian banks and news reports. 
<LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> planned late yesterday to send a telex explaining its move to international banks. 
<PERSON>Mr. Seixas</PERSON> was in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> yesterday, and international bankers complained to him about the lack of official notification. 
"There were a lot of unanswered questions at the meetings," said one <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> banker. 

   <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>'s finance minister, <PERSON>Dilson Funaro</PERSON>, who is the architect of the debt moratorium, is due in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> soon and seems guaranteed a frosty reception. 
Brazilian sources, who requested anonymity, said the minister would be in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> tomorrow to visit with <PERSON>Paul Volcker</PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Reserve Board</ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON>James Baker</PERSON>. 
Other sources said <PERSON>Mr. Funaro</PERSON> will go to <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> following his <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> visit and later will go to <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. 

   Whatever his itinerary, he has succeeded in offending the creditors. 
"He can carry on his populist line of blaming the banks, but sooner or later, people are going to realize that the problems are <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>'s own policies," said a senior <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> banker who requested anonymity. 

   <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>'s ambassador to <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Marcilio Marques Moreira</PERSON>, was more conciliatory, saying that the telexed instruction on short-term credits "is intended to be transitory and is to ensure that these credits remain stable over the coming weeks of negotiations." 

   Further signs emerged, meanwhile, that <PERSON>Mr. Funaro</PERSON> is intent on confrontation with creditors over the total <MONEY>$108 billion</MONEY> that <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> owes foreign banks, governments and international agencies. 

   Argentine sources said <PERSON>Mr. Funaro</PERSON>'s meeting <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> with <ORGANIZATION>Argentine Treasury</ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON>Mario Brodersohn</PERSON> was devoted largely to examining how <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> could help <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> if the latter faced international retaliation for a prolonged debt moratorium. 
Two questions examined were what goods <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> could guarantee <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> if other sources were cut off, and how <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> could be used as a transit point for Brazilian exports and imports. 

   Argentine Economics Minister <PERSON>Juan V. Sourrouille</PERSON> yesterday said that Brazilian primary goods destined to be incorporated into Argentine exports will temporarily be allowed automatic and unrestricted entry into <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>. 
That statement accompanied the announcement of measures to fight a surge in inflation and eliminate distortions in the Argentine economy, including a devaluation of the Argentine currency and a four-month wage and price freeze. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Brodersohn</PERSON> has expressed support for the Brazilian stand, saying that <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> also could suspend interest payments if its demands for new money are not met. 
The two countries, traditional rivals, joined in a broad attempt to strengthen trade, financial and political ties through a pact signed last year. 

   The exchange with <PERSON>Mr. Brodersohn</PERSON> -- along with <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>'s stockpiling of oil and wheat, and its transfer of assets to places unreachable by creditors -- suggests that <PERSON>Mr. Funaro</PERSON> is preparing for a long moratorium. 
Officials close to him say he is in no mood to compromise, either on returning to the International Monetary Fund or on his insistence that a long-term accord be found that slashes the current level of <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>'s interest payments. 

   In this context, a growing number of people in <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> believe his statement must be taken seriously that <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> will save <MONEY>$5.6 billion</MONEY> if the moratorium lasts until year's end.
