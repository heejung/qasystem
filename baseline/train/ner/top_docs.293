   A twin-engine plane with 11 people aboard
disappeared on what was to have been an hourlong tour of the
<LOCATION>Hawaiian Islands</LOCATION>, and searchers used helicopters and boats to look
for the plane, the <ORGANIZATION>Coast Guard</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>today</DATE>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Coast Guard Cutter Point Harris</ORGANIZATION> searched overnight
through the channel separating <LOCATION>Hawaii Island</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Maui Island</LOCATION> for the
<ORGANIZATION>Scenic Air Tour Hawaii</ORGANIZATION> plane that disappeared <DATE>Sunday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Coast Guard</ORGANIZATION> was concentrating its search for the plane off
the northeast coast of <LOCATION>Hawaii Island</LOCATION>, the last confirmed location of
the airplane, said <ORGANIZATION>Coast Guard</ORGANIZATION> spokesman Petty Officer <PERSON>Robert
Bennett</PERSON>.
   <PERSON>Bennett</PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION>Coast Guard</ORGANIZATION> received information from <ORGANIZATION>Federal
Aviation Administration</ORGANIZATION> radar tapes confirming the twin-engine
Beechcraft had left <LOCATION>Hilo International Airport</LOCATION> on the east side of
<LOCATION>Hawaii Island</LOCATION> and headed up the island's northeast coast.
   The last communication with the pilot was when he radioed an <ORGANIZATION>FAA</ORGANIZATION>
ground station that he had taken off from <LOCATION>Hilo</LOCATION> for <LOCATION>Maui</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Kahului
Airport</LOCATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION>FAA</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>George Harvey</PERSON>.
   The plane was to have toured <LOCATION>Hawaii Island</LOCATION>, including erupting
<LOCATION>Kilauea Volcano</LOCATION>, before flying on to <LOCATION>Maui</LOCATION>, said <PERSON>David Tom</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Scenic
Air Tours Hawaii</ORGANIZATION> reservationist in <LOCATION>Honolulu</LOCATION>.
   Tom, who declined to identify the pilot, said the 10 passengers
aboard the plane had set out earlier <DATE>Sunday</DATE> from <LOCATION>Honolulu</LOCATION> on <LOCATION>Oahu
Island</LOCATION>. He said they were probably tourists.
   Search efforts <DATE>Sunday</DATE> included a <ORGANIZATION>Coast Guard</ORGANIZATION> C-130 search and
rescue plane and a helicopter, two helicopters provided by the <ORGANIZATION>Maui
Fire Department</ORGANIZATION> and four Scenic Air Tour <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION> planes, said <PERSON>Bennett</PERSON>.
   Civil <ORGANIZATION>Air Patrol</ORGANIZATION> planes and a <ORGANIZATION>Coast Guard</ORGANIZATION> helicopter were to join
the search when it resumed <TIME>this morning</TIME>, <PERSON>Bennett</PERSON> said.
   <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION> police were also asked to check a section of the island
the pilot was known to fly over during tours, <PERSON>Bennett</PERSON> said. Hilo
police Sgt. <PERSON>Prentiss Morino</PERSON> said ground searches <DATE>Sunday</DATE> turned up
nothing and police were to resume looking later today.
   Air strips on the neighboring island also were checked in case
the pilot made a landing without informing the <ORGANIZATION>FAA</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Harvey</PERSON> said.
   No rains were reported on the two islands <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, which had party
sunny skies with low scattered clouds and 15 to 20 mph winds, the
<ORGANIZATION>National Weather Service</ORGANIZATION> office said. Alenuihaha Channel, which the
plane would have had to cross to get to <LOCATION>Maui Island</LOCATION>, had 5- to
6-foot seas, it said.
   In <DATE>December 1987</DATE>, a twin-engine <ORGANIZATION>Panorama Air Tours</ORGANIZATION> plane with
eight people aboard disappeared on flight from <LOCATION>Honolulu</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Molokai
Island</LOCATION>. No trace of the plane or those aboard was found.

   Rescue workers descended down ropes from a
helicopter to recover the bodies of seven of the 11 people who died
when a sightseeing plane crashed into a steep valley wall.
   County firefighters and national park rangers found the bodies of
the other four passengers, but the recovery was suspended at
nightfall <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>. They planned to return to the remote site <TIME>this
morning</TIME>.
   The twin-engine Beechcraft slammed into an 1,800-foot high wall
at the back of <LOCATION>Waipio Valley</LOCATION> on <LOCATION>Hawaii Island</LOCATION>, shortly after taking
off <DATE>Sunday</DATE> from <LOCATION>Hilo Airport</LOCATION> en route to <LOCATION>Kahului</LOCATION> on the island of
<LOCATION>Maui</LOCATION>. There were no survivors.
   The wreckage of the plane was spread over a 300-foot-long,
fire-scarred swath in the thick vegetation. It was found just after
dawn <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> by helicopters that tracked the signal from the plane's
emergency locator transmitter.
   Heavy rains and low clouds had prevented aircraft from searching
the area <DATE>Monday</DATE>.
   ``Most of it was all disintegrated,'' said <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION> County Deputy
Fire Chief <PERSON>Edward Bumatay</PERSON>. ``The biggest part they could find was
the engine down in the bottom of the valley.''
   The bodies were taken <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> to <LOCATION>Hilo Hospital</LOCATION>, where work
was to begin on identification, said <PERSON>Bruce Butts</PERSON>, operations officer
for the county <ORGANIZATION>Civil Defense Agency</ORGANIZATION>.
   Eight of the 10 passengers were identified <DATE>late Tuesday</DATE> as <PERSON>Peter

   The plane's pilot, <PERSON>Pascal Meric</PERSON>, 28, of <LOCATION>Honolulu</LOCATION>, had about 4,000
hours flying experience, said <PERSON>Doug Rogers</PERSON>, chief pilot for <ORGANIZATION>Scenic
Air Tours</ORGANIZATION>.
   The crash was the first in the company's nine-year history.
   A <ORGANIZATION>National Transportation Safety Board</ORGANIZATION> team was expected to begin

   A rescue helicopter searching a remote valley
early today spotted the wreckage of a sightseeing plane that
vanished <DATE>Sunday</DATE> with 11 people aboard, authorities said. There were
no signs of survivors.
   Pieces of the twin-engine Beechcraft were strewn over the face of
a cliff on <LOCATION>Hawaii Island</LOCATION>'s northeast coast, three miles from where
aircraft had pinpointed an emergency radio signal on <DATE>Monday</DATE>,
authorities said.
   Marines lowered themselves by ropes in an attempt to reach the
crash site, said <ORGANIZATION>Coast Guard</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>David Santos</PERSON>.
   ``Debris is spread out over a 200- to 300-meter area,'' said
<ORGANIZATION>Marine</ORGANIZATION> spokesman Maj. <PERSON>Kerry Gershaneck</PERSON>. ``There's nothing that our
people see that would identify the wreckage as an aircraft. There is
no sign of survivors.''
   The <ORGANIZATION>Scenic Air Tours</ORGANIZATION> plane disappeared without indication of
trouble <DATE>Sunday</DATE> during what was supposed to be an hour-long flight
from <LOCATION>Hawaii Island</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Maui Island</LOCATION>. The plane had left under partly
sunny skies, carrying a pilot and 10 tourists.
   Heavy rain and strong winds on <DATE>Monday</DATE> prevented helicopters from
searching the valley. A <ORGANIZATION>Coast Guard</ORGANIZATION> helicopter had picked up the
emergency signal from the <LOCATION>Waimanu Valley</LOCATION> region on the northeast
side of <LOCATION>Hawaii Island</LOCATION>.
   The valley is about four miles long with several major side
valleys and has a 320-foot-high waterfall. It cuts deep into the
5,480-foot <LOCATION>Kohala Mountain</LOCATION> and is thick with vegetation.
   The plane's last reported position was 10 miles north of <LOCATION>Hilo</LOCATION> and
flying at 2,000 feet, according to <ORGANIZATION>Federal Aviation Administration</ORGANIZATION>
spokesman <PERSON>George Harvey</PERSON>. The plane passed out of radar contact at
that point and would not have re-emerged on radar until it passed
the island's northern tip.
   The names of those aboard, eight Americans and two Australians,
will not be released until all their families have been notified,
said <PERSON>David Tom</PERSON>, the tour company's operations manager.
   The plane's 28-year-old pilot had about 4,000 hours flying
experience and had flown the around-the-island tour about 50 times,
according to <ORGANIZATION>Scenic Air Tours</ORGANIZATION> chief pilot, <PERSON>Doug Rogers</PERSON>.
   In <DATE>1987</DATE>, a twin-engine <ORGANIZATION>Panorama Air Tours</ORGANIZATION> plane with eight people
aboard disappeared without a trace on a flight from <LOCATION>Honolulu</LOCATION> to
<LOCATION>Molokai Island</LOCATION>.

   Rescuers worked to recover the last four
bodies <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> from a remote <LOCATION>Hawaii Island</LOCATION> valley where a tour
airplane crashed, killing 11 people.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Scenic Air Tours Hawaii</ORGANIZATION> plane slammed into an 1,800-foot high
wall <DATE>Sunday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME> at the back of <LOCATION>Waipio Valley</LOCATION>. There were no
survivors.
   The twin-engine Beechcraft was on a flight from <LOCATION>Hilo Airport</LOCATION> on
<LOCATION>Hawaii Island</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Kahului</LOCATION> on the island of <LOCATION>Maui</LOCATION>.
   A three-member <ORGANIZATION>National Transportation Safety Board</ORGANIZATION> team was to
travel to <LOCATION>Hawaii Island</LOCATION> to meet with officials in charge of recovery
effort, said <PERSON>Bruce Butts</PERSON>, operations officer for the <ORGANIZATION>Hawaii County
Civil Defense Agency</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>Barry Trotter</PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION>NTSB</ORGANIZATION> team, said that in addition to
examining the crash site the team would investigate Scenic Air
Tours' crew training procedures and how the company selects its
pilots.
   The plane's pilot, <PERSON>Pascal Meric</PERSON>, 28, of <LOCATION>Honolulu</LOCATION>, had about 4,000
hours flying experience, said <PERSON>Doug Rogers</PERSON>, chief pilot for <ORGANIZATION>Scenic
Air Tours</ORGANIZATION>. The crash was the first in the company's nine-year
history.
   Rescue workers descended on ropes from a helicopter to recover
seven bodies <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>. Those remains were found upslope from the main
portion of wreckage.
   ``The remains of the others, from what I understand, are in and
around the main wreckage itself, and that wreckage is hanging
precariously on the side of a steep valley wall,'' Butts said.
   Butts said <ORGANIZATION>Civil Defense</ORGANIZATION> officials, firefighters and national
park rangers were trying to minimize the risk to rescue workers
working to recover the remaining bodies.
   The twin-engine Beechcraft struck a sheer valley wall, and its
wreckage cut a 300-foot-long, fire-scarred swath as it slid downhill
through thick vegetation.
   <ORGANIZATION>Hawaii County Police</ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON>Victor Vierra</PERSON>, who visited the crash
site <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, said the impact left a burn mark ``that was the
perfect outline of the aircraft.''
   The seven bodies were taken to <LOCATION>Hilo Hospital</LOCATION>, where work was to
begin on identification, Butts said.
   Scenic Air Tours on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> released the name of a ninth
passenger: <PERSON>Delphine Clemenz</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Torrance</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif</LOCATION>.
   Eight other passengers were identified as <PERSON>Peter Spillane</PERSON> and <PERSON>Ann
Herbert</PERSON>, both of <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>; <PERSON>Jack Merle</PERSON> and <PERSON>Shirley Merle</PERSON> of

   <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION> has the nation's lowest rate of
preventable deaths from chronic diseases and <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> has the
highest, the federal <ORGANIZATION>Centers for Disease Control</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION> found that the 50 states and the <ORGANIZATION>District of Columbia</ORGANIZATION>
could have prevented at least <PERCENT>26 percent</PERCENT> of their deaths from nine
leading chronic diseases in <DATE>1986</DATE> by reducing such risks as smoking
and cholesterol levels.
   ``The bottom line is there are a lot of these deaths that are
potentially preventable,'' said <PERSON>Steven M. Teutsch</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION>
epidemiologist who helped research the study.
   ``What we are hoping states do is look at where they fall in
terms of these chronic disease deaths and then examine the specific
problems in their states.''
   The study found that <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION> had the lowest rate of preventable
deaths, with <PERCENT>26.4 percent</PERCENT> of 2,817 deaths that year labeled as
preventable. <LOCATION>North Dakota</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION>, both with <PERCENT>33.2 percent</PERCENT>, tied
for the second lowest rate. <LOCATION>New Mexico</LOCATION>, with <PERCENT>37.2 percent</PERCENT>, and
<LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION>, with <PERCENT>37.7 percent</PERCENT>, rounded out the lowest five.
   <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> had the highest rate - <PERCENT>53.5 percent</PERCENT> - followed by <LOCATION>West
Virginia</LOCATION>'s <PERCENT>53.3 percent</PERCENT>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>'s <PERCENT>52.6 percent</PERCENT>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>'s <PERCENT>52.1
percent</PERCENT> and <LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION>'s <PERCENT>52 percent</PERCENT>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION> study, published in this week's Journal of the <ORGANIZATION>American
Medical Association</ORGANIZATION>, found that if each state reduced a risk for
its most prevalent disease, the national life expectancy of 73.7
years would increase by four years.
   <PERSON>Teutsch</PERSON> said the study was the first federal effort to track
preventable deaths, which it considered stroke, coronary heart
disease, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic
liver disease and lung, breast, cervical and colorectal cancers in
<DATE>1986</DATE>, the latest year data were available.
   <PERSON>Teutsch</PERSON> said the differences in rates of preventable deaths are
``potentially explainable'' by isolating various factors.
   For instance, he said <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>'s high rate may be attributable
to it being a highly industrialized state with high minority
populations where knowledge about risk of disease is low.
   In <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>, on the other hand, the diet leans strongly toward
seafood and vegetables, which contributes to lower cholesterol
rates and less heart disease.
   Researchers figured out which state had the lowest mortality
rate of each of the diseases and added those rates to create a
mythical ``utopian state'' with the lowest death rate in all nine
diseases - about 224 per 100,000 population. Then they compared
each state to the ideal.
   <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION> came the closest to the ``utopian state,'' with 304.7
deaths per 100,000, or 80.34 above the ideal. Thus <PERCENT>26.4 percent</PERCENT> of
its deaths were considered preventable.
   <PERSON>Teutsch</PERSON> said researchers have found that reducing even one of
the known risks for these diseases - such as smoking for lung
cancer and cholesterol for heart disease - dramatically lowers
chances of developing the illnesses.
   ``What we've seen is what's been achieved in some state,''
<PERSON>Teutsch</PERSON> said, pointing out that <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION> has the nation's low heart
disease rate. ``If that's been achieved in some state, it
presumably can be achieved in another state.''
   The study found cigarette smoking contributed to the most deaths
from the nine diseases, <PERCENT>33 percent</PERCENT>. Obesity, a sedentary lifestyle,

   <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>'s seafood-rich diet may have helped give
it the nation's lowest rate of preventable deaths from nine major
diseases, while <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>'s industrial lifestyle was blamed in part
for its having the highest.
   The rankings of all 50 states and the <ORGANIZATION>District of Columbia</ORGANIZATION> came
from a <ORGANIZATION>Centers for Disease Control</ORGANIZATION> study published <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
   It looked at deaths from stroke, lung cancer, coronary heart
disease, breast cancer, diabetes, cervical cancer, chronic liver
disease, colorectal cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease in <DATE>1986</DATE>, the latest year data were available.
   The study found that <PERCENT>26.4 percent</PERCENT> of the 2,817 deaths in <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>
from those nine diseases could have been prevented - the lowest
rate in the nation. <LOCATION>North Dakota</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION>, both with <PERCENT>33.2 percent</PERCENT>,
tied for the second lowest rate.
   <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> had the highest rate - <PERCENT>53.5 percent</PERCENT> - followed by <LOCATION>West
Virginia</LOCATION> at <PERCENT>53.3 percent</PERCENT>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> with <PERCENT>52.6 percent</PERCENT>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> at <PERCENT>52.1
percent</PERCENT> and <LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION> with <PERCENT>52 percent</PERCENT>.
   The differences depended on several variables but could be
explained, at least partially, with a little guesswork, said <PERSON>Steven
M. Teutsch</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION> epidemiologist who worked on the study published
in the Journal of the <ORGANIZATION>American Medical Association</ORGANIZATION>.
   <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>'s high rate may be because it is highly industrialized
and has large minority populations that might know little about
disease risks, he speculated.
   In <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>, people tend to eat more seafood and vegetables; that
contributes to lower cholesterol rates and less heart disease, he
said.
   Researchers arrived at their figures using a model based on
combining the lowest death rates for each disease to create a
``utopian state'' with an overall, combined death rate for the nine
diseases of about 224 per 100,000 people.
   Then they compared each state to the ideal.
   <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION> came the closest, with 304.7 deaths per 100,000, or 80.34
deaths above the ideal. Thus <PERCENT>26.4 percent</PERCENT> of its deaths were
considered preventable.
   The study found smoking contributed to the most deaths from the
nine diseases, <PERCENT>33 percent</PERCENT>. Obesity, a sedentary lifestyle, high
cholesterol, hypertension and diabetes followed.
   <PERSON>Teutsch</PERSON> said researchers have found that reducing even one of
the known risks for each disease - such as smoking for lung cancer
and cholesterol for heart disease - dramatically lowers chances of
developing the illnesses.

<HEAD>Maui Boat Missing Nearly 10 Years Found in Marshalls</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GREG SMALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   A grave discovered on a small, uninhabited atoll
in the <LOCATION>Marshall Islands</LOCATION> was believed to contain the remains of one
of five <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION> fishermen who disappeared nearly 10 years ago,
authorities said.
   The grave and what remained of the men's 17-foot fiberglass
boat, the <PERSON>Sarah Joe</PERSON>, were found on <LOCATION>Sibylla Island</LOCATION> last month by a
<ORGANIZATION>U.S. National Marine Fisheries</ORGANIZATION> worker and an archaeologist studying
green turtles and sea birds, <ORGANIZATION>Coast Guard</ORGANIZATION> Capt. <PERSON>Jim Cushman</PERSON> said
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
   Two forensics experts and a 27-member <ORGANIZATION>Coast Guard</ORGANIZATION> shore group
were sent to the island, located 2,054 nautical miles from <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>,
after officials in <LOCATION>Honolulu</LOCATION> were notified late last month, <PERSON>Cushman</PERSON>
said.
   ``It (the grave) was located some yards above the high water
mark,'' he said. ``It was a cairn of rocks with a crude cross on
top of it.''
   The partial remains, comprising about <PERCENT>60 percent</PERCENT> of a skeleton,
including a lower jawbone, were found in the shallow grave, <PERSON>Cushman</PERSON>
said. A skull was not recovered, he said.
   A 2{-day search of the island, measuring about three miles by
less than half a mile, and nearby islands turned up no other human
artifacts, <PERSON>Cushman</PERSON> said.
   The island was described as uninhabitable, with no water or
vegetation, he said.
   The remains were transported last week to the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Central
Identification Laboratory</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Honolulu</LOCATION>, where an attempt to make a
positive identification will be made once medical records of the
five men are obtained, said Capt. <PERSON>Paul Bethke</PERSON>. It is possible the
remains might not be associated with the <PERSON>Sarah Joe</PERSON>, he said.
   The <PERSON>Sarah Joe</PERSON> was reported missing <DATE>Feb. 11, 1979</DATE>, after it
failed to return from a one-day fishing trip off Hana, <LOCATION>Maui</LOCATION>.
   A search for the boat was suspended after five days following a
56,000-square-mile search involving aircraft from the <ORGANIZATION>Coast Guard</ORGANIZATION>,
<ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Marine Corps</ORGANIZATION>, civil air patrol and commercial and private
aircraft.
   Registration numbers on the boat's hull and the boat's
manufacturer's number were used to identify the <PERSON>Sarah Joe</PERSON>, said
<ORGANIZATION>Coast Guard</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>Keith Spangler</PERSON>.

   A search continued <DATE>Sunday</DATE> for a commuter plane
with 20 people aboard that disappeared <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> on a
scheduled 35-minute flight from the island of <LOCATION>Maui</LOCATION> to the island of
<LOCATION>Molokai</LOCATION>, officials said.
   The Aloha IslandAir DH6 Twin Otter failed to reach <LOCATION>Molokai
Airport</LOCATION> after leaving <LOCATION>Kahului Airport</LOCATION> at <TIME>6:25 p.m.</TIME> (<TIME>12:25 a.m. EDT</TIME>
<DATE>Sunday</DATE>), said <PERSON>Don Early</PERSON>, air traffic manager for the <ORGANIZATION>Federal
Aviation Administration</ORGANIZATION> at the <LOCATION>Honolulu Airport</LOCATION>.
   There was no distress call from the plane's two-member crew and
no signals have been detected from an emergency locator transmitter
aboard the plane, said Sgt. <PERSON>William Bowker</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Joint Rescue
Coordination Center</ORGANIZATION>.
   The last radar fix on the plane was when it was two miles off
the northeast shore of <LOCATION>Molokai</LOCATION>, officials said.
   Two <ORGANIZATION>Coast Guard</ORGANIZATION> C130 search planes, two helicopters and two
cutters were dispatched to search the 3,000-square-mile area of the
Pailolo Channel between the two islands, said Chief Petty Officer
<PERSON>Dennis Hubbard</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Coast Guard</ORGANIZATION> spokesman.
   By <DATE>early Sunday</DATE>, the two helicopters and one C130 had been
recalled from the search area to await first light before rejoining
the search, said Petty Officer First Class <PERSON>Francesca Bozem</PERSON> at the
rescue center.
   Two <ORGANIZATION>Civil Air Patrol</ORGANIZATION> planes also were to join the search, she
said. Aloha IslandAir planned to send two aircraft to join in the
search at daylight, said <PERSON>Stephanie Ackerman</PERSON>, a spokeswoman for
<ORGANIZATION>Aloha IslandAir</ORGANIZATION>.
   <LOCATION>Kahului</LOCATION> is about 100 miles southeast of <LOCATION>Honolulu</LOCATION>.
   Searchers reported rain in the area was limiting visbility,
<PERSON>Hubbard</PERSON> said. The weather service said there were only scattered
clouds and 18 mph winds during the scheduled time of the flight.
   The plane, owned by a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION>Aloha Airlines</ORGANIZATION>, was carrying
18 passengers and a crew of two, <ORGANIZATION>Early</ORGANIZATION> said. Thirteen passengers
are from <LOCATION>Molokai</LOCATION>, one is from <LOCATION>Maui</LOCATION>, two are from <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> and
two are from <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION>, said <PERSON>Ackerman</PERSON>. The names of the passenger and
crew were not released.
   About 10 police officers searched the coastlines of <LOCATION>Maui</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Molokai</LOCATION> and the island of <LOCATION>Lanai</LOCATION> ``looking for flares or any kind of
distress signal,'' said officer <PERSON>Peter Akuna</PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION>Maui Police

<TEXT>     They make stops at <LOCATION>Kauai</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Maui</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Big Island</LOCATION> of <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>. Visitors can
fly in from the mainland and just hop on board.;    The Independence was built
in <DATE>1950</DATE> and was the first of the sister ships to re-enter the trade after
American ocean cruises had stopped. Bought in <DATE>1978</DATE> by <ORGANIZATION>American Hawaii Cruises</ORGANIZATION>,
the ship started sailing <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION> waters in <DATE>1980.</DATE>;     The Constitution entered
service in <DATE>1951</DATE> with voyages between <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>, and took <PERSON>Grace Kelly</PERSON>
to her wedding to <ORGANIZATION>Prince Rainier</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Monaco</LOCATION>. In <DATE>1982</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Princess Grace</ORGANIZATION>
rechristened the vessel for <ORGANIZATION>American Hawaii Cruises</ORGANIZATION> when it joined the
Independence.;    Both ships have undergone <MONEY>$25 million</MONEY> in renovations in the
past 18 months, and both have occupancy rates greater than <PERCENT>100 percent</PERCENT> in
<DATE>summer</DATE>, since young families book vacations then with children in tow.;   
Along the <LOCATION>Honolulu</LOCATION> waterfront, the Independence and the Constitution have
become heirs to the long tradition of American shipping. Each week as the
ships depart majestically, a bit of the magic of "Boat Day" is recaptured, and
it is easy to sense the years of tradition that the vessels continue.;    Time
aboard passes leisurely, Hawaii-style. Visitors spend hours lounging in the
sun, walking the decks, exercising in the fitness spas, relaxing in the
refurbished lounges and dining on the succulent Hawaiian fare.;    The
American registry of the sister ships means that they are staffed with all
American crews. "Passengers frequently find neighbors to share the hometown
news with," says Capt. <PERSON>Lawrence W. Kelley</PERSON>, master of the Independence.;   
Reaching all islands;  All the major islands are accessible by <ORGANIZATION>American Hawaii
Cruises.</ORGANIZATION>;    <LOCATION>Oahu</LOCATION>, "The Gathering Place," is ringed by protective coral reefs,
its legendary beaches stretching as far as the eye can see. At its heart is
world-famous <LOCATION>Waikiki Beach</LOCATION>, yet just a few miles beyond are pineapple and
coconut groves and ancient fishing villages.;    <LOCATION>Maui</LOCATION> may be the only place in
the world where humpback whales cause traffic jams. That is because so many
drivers stop to watch along the Honoapiilani Highway during the <DATE>November-May</DATE>
migrating season, when two-thirds of the <LOCATION>North Pacific</LOCATION> giants, <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>'s
biggest visitors, stop by.;    <LOCATION>Maui</LOCATION> is <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>'s second-largest island, and
also ranks No. 2 in visitors. <LOCATION>Lahaina</LOCATION>, the old whaling port where humpbacks
sing and cavort for visitors, is still the center of the action, but the
narrow, dusty streets <PERSON>Herman Melville</PERSON> walked are brightly lined with shops,
art galleries, restaurants and night spots.;    <DATE>Today</DATE>, the ships anchor
offshore, and visitors are taken by tender to <LOCATION>Lahaina</LOCATION>. Strolling its streets
and beaches is an easy way to kick back in paradise.;    <LOCATION>Haleakala</LOCATION>, the mighty
volcano called the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> of the Sun, which stretches 10,000 feet out of the
sea, is the not-to-be-missed sight on <LOCATION>Maui</LOCATION>. Once visitors have seen it at
sunrise, they understand why <PERSON>Mark Twain</PERSON> called it "the sublimest spectacle I
ever witnessed.";    Sunshine on <LOCATION>Kauai</LOCATION>;  <LOCATION>Kauai</LOCATION>, the resort of ancient kings
and modern filmmakers, is the third-largest island, and ranks third in
visitors because of its gorgeous beaches, dependable sunshine and wonderful
sunsets. The ancient kings knew how to pick resorts, and visitors are
following in their footsteps to <LOCATION>Poipu Beach</LOCATION> on its south shore.;    The ships
tie up in <LOCATION>Nawiliwili</LOCATION>, but it is easy to arrange any ground tour desired. The
port itself is a working harbor, and not a great place to spend a day.;    In
addition to <LOCATION>Poipu</LOCATION>, many visitors choose the visually dramatic recreational
resort at <LOCATION>Princeville</LOCATION>. The unsurpassed sight at <ORGANIZATION>Puupoa Point</ORGANIZATION>, with its post
card perfect vista of <LOCATION>Hanalei</LOCATION>, was the sight for shooting the <LOCATION>Bali</LOCATION> Hai scene
in "South Pacific.";    Near the northernmost point of the <LOCATION>Big Island of
Hawaii</LOCATION>, there is a special place called <LOCATION>Waipio Valley</LOCATION>. The 2,000-foot gouge in
the earth is one of the great panoramas of the islands, and the two waterfalls
at the head are silver ribbons in the lush greenery.;    Towering above the
little valley is the snow-capped peak of <LOCATION>Mauna Kea</LOCATION>, home of the world's
greatest concentration of space-age telescopes. This may be the only place on
earth where it is possible to drive in a single day from an orchid-lined road
through a rain forest to a scene of lunar-like desolation high above the
clouds.;    The ships tie up off <LOCATION>Kailua-Kona</LOCATION>, where visitors can spend the day
or arrange day tours. Hilo is the other <LOCATION>Big Island</LOCATION> port of call, where
organized tours are a lot better idea than spending the day wandering the old
town.;    <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>'s not-to-be-missed spectacle is <LOCATION>Kilauea</LOCATION>, the world's only
"drive-in" volcano, which offers the thrill of frequent, easily accessible
eruptions. The ride around Crater Rim Drive gives visitors the feeling they
can reach out and almost touch the volcano.;    As usual, <PERSON>Twain</PERSON> probably put
it best when he wrote of <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>: "No other land could so longingly and
beseechingly haunt me sleeping and waking through half a lifetime, as that one
has done."; IF YOU'RE INTERESTED; (box) ITINERARIES -- Both the Independence
and the Constitution depart every <DATE>Saturday</DATE> from <LOCATION>Honolulu</LOCATION>. The Constitution
offers 3- and 4-day packages as well as week-long cruises; the Independence
has only 7-day cruises. Both ships sail to <LOCATION>Maui</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kauai</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Kona</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Hilo</LOCATION> on
the Big Island.; (box) RATES -- The packages offered by the Constitution
include either three or four nights at hotels on the various islands. Prices
for both ships (cruise only) start at <MONEY>$1,095</MONEY> per person for an inside cabin.
The top end price (outside two-room suite) is <MONEY>$3,695</MONEY> per person. The company

<HEAD>Tropical Storm Marie Closes in on Hawaii Island</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONOLULU (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tropical Storm <PERSON>Marie</PERSON>, downgraded from a
hurricane, moved today toward <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>. Residents were advised to
prepare for winds of up to 73 mph.
   Hurricane <PERSON>Marie</PERSON> was downgraded late <DATE>Sunday</DATE> after its top
sustained winds fell from 85 mph to 70 mph. A storm must have
sustained winds of 74 mph to be classified a hurricane. Marie's
winds still gusted to 85 mph, the <ORGANIZATION>National Weather Service</ORGANIZATION> said.
   Marie storm was 210 miles southeast of <LOCATION>Hilo</LOCATION> on <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>,
heading for <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION> at 9 mph, forecasters said. If it stays on the
same course, the storm center would pass 130 miles south of <LOCATION>South
Point</LOCATION> on <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>, known as the <LOCATION>Big Island</LOCATION>, <TIME>this afternoon</TIME>,
forecasters said.
   A tropical storm warning, meaning winds of 39 mph to 73 mph were
possible, was posted for <LOCATION>Hawaii Island</LOCATION>. A tropical storm watch was
posted for <LOCATION>Maui County</LOCATION>, including the islands of <LOCATION>Maui</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Molokai</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Lanai</LOCATION>. There were no warnings for <LOCATION>Oahu Island</LOCATION>, where <LOCATION>Honolulu</LOCATION> is
located.
   Gale-force winds, ranging from 39 to 54 mph, extend 140 miles
from the center, the weather service said.
   High surf kicked up by the storm hammered the east and south
shores of <LOCATION>Hawaii Island</LOCATION>, prompting the closing of <LOCATION>Punaluu Beach
Park</LOCATION> with surf on <DATE>Monday</DATE> ranging from 8 to 10 feet where it
normally averages 1 to 2 feet, said <ORGANIZATION>County Civil Defense</ORGANIZATION>
Administrator <PERSON>Harry Kim</PERSON>.
   The southeast section of the island was already experiencing
some strong gusty winds <DATE>Monday</DATE>, blowing debris onto some roadways,
<PERSON>Kim</PERSON> said.
   There were no reports of any property damage related to the surf
or wind, he said.

<TEXT>
   High school students on <LOCATION>Molokai Island</LOCATION>
wept and prayed <DATE>Monday</DATE> for classmates and educators who were among
20 people killed in <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>'s worst commuter airplane crash.
   A <ORGANIZATION>National Transportation Safety Board</ORGANIZATION> team arrived <DATE>Monday</DATE> to
investigate <ORGANIZATION>Aloha IslandAir</ORGANIZATION> Flight 1712, which slammed into a ridge
near <LOCATION>Halawa Valley</LOCATION> on the island's eastern end <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> en
route from neighboring <LOCATION>Maui</LOCATION>. There were no survivors.
   Rescuers recovered 20 bodies <DATE>Sunday</DATE> from the charred wreckage of
the DH6 Twin Otter.
   The victims included eight members of <ORGANIZATION>Molokai High School</ORGANIZATION>'s
volleyball teams, the coach of the girl's team and the school's
athletic director. Three other island residents also were killed.
   The crash stunned <LOCATION>Molokai</LOCATION>, a rural island with 6,000 residents.
Many drivers attached green and white streamers to their car radio
antennas <DATE>Monday</DATE>. Molokai High's colors are green and white.
   ``It's small enough here so that everybody knows each other,''
said the Rev. <PERSON>Robb Kojima</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Kalaiakamanu Hou Congregational
Church</ORGANIZATION>. ``It's almost like the feeling when the (space shuttle)
Challenger blew up. In the same sense, we all feel the grief.''
   Students at <LOCATION>Molokai</LOCATION> High gathered for a morning assembly. State
psychologists and psychiatrists and two sent by Aloha IslandAir
were on hand to help students cope with the tragedy.
   The school will establish a special counseling center as well,
Principal <PERSON>Clifford Horita</PERSON> said.
   State Health Director <PERSON>Dr. John Lewin</PERSON> said a six-member <ORGANIZATION>Mental
Health Division</ORGANIZATION> crisis team will be available to counsel families
and friends of the victims.
   Fire rescue teams used helicopters to ferry the bodies back to
<LOCATION>Kahului Airport</LOCATION> on <LOCATION>Maui</LOCATION>. State crisis team workers were on hand to
assist relatives who were flown to the island.
   The twin-engine plane was 16 years old and had made 28,000
flights, <PERSON>Peter Dudgeon</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Aloha IslandAir</ORGANIZATION>'s vice president and
general manager, said <DATE>Sunday</DATE>. It was rebuilt in <DATE>1986</DATE> and had no
significant maintenance problems, he said.
   The plane left <LOCATION>Kahului Airport</LOCATION> at <TIME>6:25 p.m.</TIME> <DATE>Saturday</DATE> for a
scheduled 35-minute flight, said <PERSON>Don Early</PERSON>, air traffic manager for
the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Aviation Administration</ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION>Honolulu Airport</LOCATION>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Coast Guard</ORGANIZATION> launched a search shortly after <TIME>8 p.m.</TIME> when the
airline reported the plane missing, officials said. The plane was
sighted at <TIME>5:45 a.m.</TIME> <DATE>Sunday</DATE>. Wreckage was found over a 300-foot
area.
   There was no distress call from the crew and no signals were
detected from an emergency locator transmitter aboard the plane,
said Sgt. <PERSON>William Bowker</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Joint Rescue Coordination Center</ORGANIZATION>.
   The pilot of the plane, Captain <PERSON>Bruce Pollard</PERSON>, 30, had flown for
the airline for two years, <PERSON>Dudgeon</PERSON> said. He and First Officer <PERSON>Phil
Helfrich</PERSON>, 27, were from <LOCATION>Oahu Island</LOCATION>, which includes <LOCATION>Honolulu</LOCATION>.
   Aloha IslandAir said the passenger list included <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> and
<PERSON>Elizabeth Wiley</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION>, <PERSON>John Craig</PERSON> and <PERSON>Christina Batura</PERSON> of
<LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION>, and <PERSON>Hank Gabriel</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Maui</LOCATION>. The airline earlier identified
<PERSON>Ms. Batura</PERSON> as <PERSON>Christina Craig</PERSON>, which is how she checked in with the
carrier. Her real name was released <DATE>Monday</DATE>.
   The <LOCATION>Molokai</LOCATION> passengers were identified by the airline as girl's

<TEXT>
   Hurricane Dalilia weakened to a powerful tropical
storm <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> and continued on a track that would take it just
south of <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>, forecasters said.
   <LOCATION>Hawaii Island</LOCATION> residents were stocking up on batteries, canned
goods and other emergency supplies as the storm approached from the
southeast.
   Dalilia surprised forecasters <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> by turning to the north,
putting it on track to pass 70 miles south of <LOCATION>Hawaii Island</LOCATION>,
southernmost in the chain, late <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
   A tropical storm watch _ meaning wind up to 73 mph and heavy rain
were possible _ remained in effect for <LOCATION>Hawaii Island</LOCATION>.
   At <TIME>8 a.m. HST</TIME> <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, the hurricane was about 230 miles
southeast of <LOCATION>Hilo</LOCATION>, on <LOCATION>Hawaii Island</LOCATION>, moving west-northwest at about
13 mph, the <ORGANIZATION>National Weather Service</ORGANIZATION> said. Its maximum sustained
wind speed was 70 mph; a storm is classified a hurricane when that
speed reaches 74 mph. Wind gusted to 85 mph.
   <PERSON>Clarence Lee</PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION>Central Pacific Hurricane Center</ORGANIZATION>, said
<PERSON>Dalilia</PERSON> was expected to weaken but remain a tropical storm for a few
days.
   In Naalehu, the southernmost community in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, many
residents were buying emergency supplies.
   ``They've been buying lots of batteries and canned goods _
candles and lamps too,'' said <PERSON>Janice Javar</PERSON>, a cashier at <ORGANIZATION>Naalehu
Food Center</ORGANIZATION>. ``Almost everyone mentions the hurricane.''
   Naalehu, with about 5,000 residents, is the closest community to
<LOCATION>Hawaii Island</LOCATION>'s south tip.
   <LOCATION>Hawaii Island</LOCATION> beach parks were closed for the second day as surf
surged to more than 15 feet on the southeast coast.
   <ORGANIZATION>Civil Defense</ORGANIZATION> officials closed several seldom-used roads along
<LOCATION>Hawaii Island</LOCATION>'s south shore.
   ``The purpose is to keep campers out so when the storm hits we
don't have to go in and rescue them,'' said <PERSON>Neil Gyotoku</PERSON>, a
spokesman for <ORGANIZATION>Hawaii County Civil Defense</ORGANIZATION>.
   There were no immediate plans for evacuation, he said.
   Although there were reports of waves washing up on coastal roads,
<LOCATION>Hilo</LOCATION> police said no injuries or damage were reported as of late
<DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
   The last major storm to hit <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION> was Hurricane Iwa, which
brushed the island of <LOCATION>Oahu</LOCATION> and roared over of <LOCATION>Kauai</LOCATION> with wind up to
117 mph in <DATE>November 1982</DATE>, causing <MONEY>$234 million</MONEY> damage.

   Tropical Storm <PERSON>Marie</PERSON> headed farther south of the
<LOCATION>Hawaiian Islands</LOCATION> than previously expected <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, but forecasters
cautioned residents to prepare for effects of the storm.
   High surf kicked up by the storm hammered the eastern and
southern shores of <LOCATION>Hawaii Island</LOCATION>, prompting the closing of <LOCATION>Punaluu
Beach Park</LOCATION>. Surf there ranged from 8 to 10 feet, up from a normal
average of 1 to 2 feet, <ORGANIZATION>Hawaii County Civil Defense</ORGANIZATION> Administrator
<PERSON>Harry Kim</PERSON> said.
   The southeastern section of the island also experienced some
strong, gusty wind that blew debris onto some roads, <PERSON>Kim</PERSON> said.
   There were no reports of any property damage caused by the surf
or wind, he said.
   The storm was expected to pass about 250 miles south of the
<LOCATION>South Point</LOCATION> area of <LOCATION>Hawaii Island</LOCATION>.
   On <DATE>Monday</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>National Weather Service</ORGANIZATION> predicted the storm
would come within 130 miles of <LOCATION>Hawaii Island</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>Big Island</LOCATION>, but
the storm began veering from a westerly course to the southwest.
   At <TIME>2 a.m.</TIME>, the storm was about 235 miles south southeast of
<LOCATION>Hilo</LOCATION>, on <LOCATION>Hawaii Island</LOCATION>'s east coast, and was moving to the
southwest at 9 mph.
   The storm, downgraded from a hurricane <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, had a maximum
sustained wind speed of 65 mph with 85 mph gusts. Gale force wind
extended 125 miles out from the center.
   The storm's intensity was expected to change little until the
same time <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, the weather service said.
   A tropical storm warning remained in effect for <LOCATION>Hawaii Island</LOCATION>
and a tropical storm watch was in effect for the islands of <LOCATION>Maui</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Molokai</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Lanai</LOCATION>. No storm warnings were issued for <LOCATION>Kauai</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Oahu</LOCATION>
islands; <LOCATION>Honolulu</LOCATION> is located on <LOCATION>Oahu</LOCATION>.
   A tropical storm warning means wind blowing at a sustained speed
of 39 mph to 73 mph is possible within 24 hours or less. A watch
means there is a threat of tropical storm conditions within 36
hours.

   Hurricane Dalilia surprised forecasters and
turned north, putting it on course to pass close to <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION> <DATE>late
today</DATE> and prompting authorities to warn residents anew to stock up
on emergency items.
   On <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, the storm appeared to be turning away from the
islands, but it shifted to a northwesterly direction and forecasters
said <PERSON>Dalilia</PERSON> could come closer than they initially expected.
   Forecasters said <ORGANIZATION>Dalilia</ORGANIZATION>'s new track would bring its center to
within 70 miles of <LOCATION>Hawaii Island</LOCATION>'s south coast late today.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Central Pacific Hurricane Center</ORGANIZATION> expected to upgrade a
tropical storm watch _ meaning wind up to 73 mph and heavy rain were
possible _ to a hurricane warning for <LOCATION>Hawaii Island</LOCATION>, southernmost in
the Hawaiian chain.
   At <TIME>2 a.m.</TIME> <DATE>today</DATE>, the hurricane was about 310 miles southeast of
<LOCATION>Hilo</LOCATION>, on <LOCATION>Hawaii Island</LOCATION>, moving west-northwest at about 13 mph, the
<ORGANIZATION>National Weather Service</ORGANIZATION> said. Its maximum sustained wind speed was
75 mph; a storm is classified a hurricane when that speed reaches 74
mph. Wind gusted to 90 mph.
   <ORGANIZATION>National Weather Service</ORGANIZATION> forecaster <PERSON>Dick Sasaki</PERSON> said <PERSON>Dalilia</PERSON>'s
hurricane-force winds extend to 25 miles from its center.
   ``The storm's center would have to pass very close or right over
any of the islands to bring any hurricane-force winds,'' <PERSON>Sasaki</PERSON> said.
   ``Right now our main concern is high surf,'' said <PERSON>Neil Gyotoku</PERSON>, a
spokesman for <ORGANIZATION>Hawaii County Civil Defense</ORGANIZATION>. ``High tide is this
afternoon and they're expecting bigger surf to hit about then.''
   There were no immediate plans for evacuation, <PERSON>Gyotoku</PERSON> said.
   Hawaii residents were urged to stock up on batteries, canned
goods and other emergency supplies.
   <LOCATION>Hawaii Island</LOCATION> beach parks were closed <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> when surf surged to
more than 15 feet on the southeast coast of <LOCATION>Hawaii Island</LOCATION>.
   ``We're going to be keeping these beaches closed as a
precautionary measure,'' said <PERSON>Bruce Butts</PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION>Hawaii
County Civil Defense</ORGANIZATION>.
   Although there were reports of waves washing up on coastal roads
in some spots, <LOCATION>Hilo</LOCATION> police said there were no reports of injury or

Mature travelers who enjoy combining travel with education will appreciate the 
program offered by <ORGANIZATION>ElderFolk</ORGANIZATION>, a fast-growing program founded in <DATE>1984</DATE> by the 
<ORGANIZATION>Oregon-based Folkways Institute</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
ElderFolk is designed for adults age 55 and older, and is described as a 
"school without walls" because, unlike many study programs for seniors that 
take place on college campuses in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and abroad, ElderFolk 
provides on-site lectures, discussions and individual exploration in the 
countries visited. 
</P>
<P>
Programs are designed to be economical while still providing participants the 
opportunity to explore other cultures by direct contact with local citizens. 
</P>
<P>
ElderFolk programs vary in length and do not require any specific education 
level or previous knowledge of the areas visited. There are no textbooks, 
homework or study preparation. 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>Folkways Institute</ORGANIZATION> has scheduled more than 15 tours for the remainder of 
<DATE>1990</DATE> and through <DATE>1991</DATE>, with other destinations to be added. 
</P>
<P>
A sampling of the types of tours and subject matter includes: "Discover the 
Agean" (<LOCATION>Greece</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Turkey</LOCATION>), emphasizing the region's influence on the modern 
world, <DATE>May 3-24, 1991</DATE>, <MONEY>$2,160</MONEY>; "Back Country <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>," devoted to an ecological, 
cultural and geological overview of the <LOCATION>Big Island of Hawaii</LOCATION>, <DATE>Jan. 11-20</DATE>, <DATE>1991</DATE>, 
<MONEY>$1,260</MONEY>, and "<LOCATION>Myanmar</LOCATION> (<LOCATION>Burma</LOCATION>), <LOCATION>Rangoon</LOCATION> to Inle Lake," focusing on the natural 
and cultural wonders of the Republic of <LOCATION>Myanmar</LOCATION>, <DATE>Feb. 6-22, 1991</DATE>, <MONEY>$2,325</MONEY>. 
</P>
<P>
The free ElderFolk catalogue contains details of the philosophy and background 
of the <ORGANIZATION>Folkways Institute</ORGANIZATION> and a brief description of all of the tours scheduled 
for 1990-91.

<P>
Mature travelers make up a high percentage of passengers on freighters, 
according to a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION>Cruise &amp; Freighter Travel Assn</ORGANIZATION>. 
Flexibility is the key to freighter travel since the vessels' schedules are 
dictated by the cargo on board and any that might be picked up along the way. 
</P>
<P>
Newer freighters are being constructed with the express intent of carrying 
passengers, too, and cabins are increasingly more spacious and better 
decorated. One new freighter, <ORGANIZATION>Ivaran Lines</ORGANIZATION>' Americana, can book 88 passengers, 
although most freighters offering service from the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> carry a 
maximum of 12. 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>Cruise &amp; Freighter Travel Assn.</ORGANIZATION> has published a free booklet entitled, 
"35 Most Commonly Asked Questions About Freighter Travel." It tells about 
length of trips, shipboard activities, possible destinations, food service, 
language problems on foreign carriers, accommodations, health requirements, 
fares and discounts, booking procedures and other subjects. 
</P>
<P>
For a free copy of the booklet, write to the <ORGANIZATION>Cruise &amp; Freighter Travel 
Assn.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>P.O.</LOCATION> Box 218, <LOCATION>Flushing</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION> 11358, or call (800) 872-8584 during normal 
business hours. 
</P>
<P>
Mature travelers who are considering a trip to the <LOCATION>Hawaiian Islands</LOCATION> <DATE>this year</DATE> 
can benefit from what are called "Prime Time Perks" -- fringe benefits offered 
by <ORGANIZATION>Island Holidays Tours</ORGANIZATION> to persons over age 60. Bonus features may include 
tours, special amenities or upgrades at certain properties.

<LEADPARA>  THE first Polynesian settlers reached the Hawaiian Islands by sea about 500
B.C. and British explorer Capt. James Cook sailed there in the 18th century,
so it seemed odd to me on my first visit to Hawaii 15 years ago that I
couldn't travel from island to island by sea. Not only the Polynesians and
Captain Cook had done it, but Yankee whalers and missionaries in the 19th
century. But in the 20th century, I couldn't.;    Instead, I hopped on and off
planes for a 30-minute flight from Honolulu to Kauai, about 100 miles away,
and to Maui, another 100-mile, half-hour flight. When I was in Honolulu, there
was Molokai in the distance just 26 miles away. From Molokai to Maui, the
channel is only nine miles wide. But by sea there was no getting there from
here.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     But <DATE>10 years ago</DATE>, two former transatlantic passenger ships, the
Constitution and the Independence were refurbished to cruise the <LOCATION>Hawaiian
Islands</LOCATION>. And last <DATE>spring</DATE> I joined 790 other passengers in <LOCATION>Honolulu</LOCATION> for a
weeklong American-Hawaii Line cruise of these waters that the Polynesians, the
explorers, the whalers and the missionaries had sailed.;    Skies lowered and
rain fell almost constantly as the Constitution made her way from <LOCATION>Honolulu</LOCATION> to
<LOCATION>Maui</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Maui</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Kauai</LOCATION>. To go ashore in <LOCATION>Kona</LOCATION> on the <LOCATION>Big
Island</LOCATION> of <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION> I wore a bathing suit. There was no point in getting other
clothes that wet. And I opted for a submarine fish-seeing tour figuring that,
under water, I would be in the right company. It didn't really matter, though,
as the 46-passenger mini Atlantis submarine took us down 150 feet to a coral
reef in the harbor where schools of zebra-striped fish and surgeon fish and
blue-striped snappers swarmed around a diver feeding them stale bread and
lettuce.;    Of course the American-Hawaii Cruise Line cannot be blamed for
the weather, but the season to avoid in <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION> -- the inviting warmth of the
climate notwithstanding -- is the <DATE>December</DATE> to <DATE>February</DATE> rainy season. Even
then, the rain comes in quick, heavy showers and is gone again just as
quickly.;     In <LOCATION>Kona</LOCATION>, after my submarine outing, I spent an hour indoors at
<ORGANIZATION>Hulihee Palace</ORGANIZATION>, a <DATE>summer</DATE> palace for some of <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>'s last royalty. (An
advantage of <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>, in any weather, is its large number of well maintained
historic houses, palaces and museums -- many operated by <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>'s equivalent
of the <ORGANIZATION>DAR</ORGANIZATION>, the Daughters of <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>, descendants of missionaries interested in
preserving old <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>'s heritage.) The palace was rich in Hawaiian antiques
and royal memorabilia (including a 180-pound exercise ball that 18th-century
King Kamehameha the Great is said to have used and a hatbox made from a
hollowed-out coconut tree trunk.);    In <LOCATION>Hilo</LOCATION>, on the other side of the
island, I saw the early-morning <DATE>Monday</DATE> through <DATE>Saturday</DATE> Suisan Fish Auction
where hotel buyers poked with their umbrellas at the fish they wanted -- red
snapper, blue marlin, yellowfin tuna and wahoo. The taxi driver who had picked
me up at the ship also had provided a brief tour of other waterfront sights --
the Japanese Garden with miniature pagodas and stone bridges and lanterns and
bamboo.;    A land excursion from the ship took passengers to <ORGANIZATION>Rainbow Falls</ORGANIZATION>
where mist from the 125-foot falls and sun commingle to make the rainbows;
ferns grow as tall as trees; elephant ear leaves are carried as umbrellas;
philodendron and trumpet flowers grow.;    Another possible excursion was to
<LOCATION>Hawaii Volcanoes National Park</LOCATION> where <LOCATION>Kilauea Volcano</LOCATION> lava is oozing like black
tar toward the ocean and one can walk out on the lava flow, feel the heat
beneath it; see the destruction it has wrought.;    Sailing from <LOCATION>Hilo</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Kona</LOCATION>
we watched the burning lava -- like a stream of lights -- descend the mountain
side and splash -- with a further explosion of lights -- into the black sea.; 
  On <LOCATION>Kauai</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>Garden Island</LOCATION> where "South Pacific" was filmed,
fellow-passengers and I rented a car to drive through little tin-roofed
villages, past taro fields to the beauty spots of its North Shore where the
blue seas thunder in on white sand and rock and ironwood trees grow tall. Had
the weather been better, another option would have been a view from a Zodiac
raft of this northern <LOCATION>Na Pali</LOCATION> coast, or from a helicopter.;    I spent the
afternoon of my <LOCATION>Kauai</LOCATION> visit wandering the over-manicured, over-fancified
grounds of the <LOCATION>Westin Kauai</LOCATION> at <LOCATION>Kauai</LOCATION> Lagoons resort, whose mammoth high-rise
bulk I had seen looming alongshore as the Constitution pulled into <LOCATION>Nawiliwili
Harbor.</LOCATION>;    On a post-cruise excursion on the <LOCATION>Big Island</LOCATION>, I spent time on the
still grander similar resort, the <LOCATION>Hyatt Regency Waikoloa</LOCATION> where the waterfalls
and lagoons and canals are artificial. Trams take one from the registration
desk to one's accommodation (or it is possible, instead, to travel on a
canopied boat along one of the canals). Guests can swim in a pool with
dolphins.;    On <LOCATION>Maui</LOCATION>, the land excursions included a bus trip through green
hills and effulgent valleys where plumeria and orange African tulips bloom to
the <LOCATION>Iao Needle</LOCATION>, a rock spearing 1,200 feet from the valley floor.
Unfortunately, again, rain impeded seeing it with clarity.;    Land excursions
from the Independence or the Constitution are an expensive add-on to a
Hawaiian Islands cruise (they range from <MONEY>$15</MONEY> to <MONEY>$125</MONEY>).;    As for shipboard
time, there are hula, lei-making and ukulele lessons to take take free of
charge; nightly cabaret entertainment; good, if not exceptional meals
pleasantly served in pretty dining saloons. Cabins are well decorated and well
tended.;    And I was right. It feels better, somehow, to be sailing through
an island chain rather than flying through it.;    (check) IF YOU GO --
American-Hawaii cruises leave <LOCATION>Honolulu</LOCATION> on <DATE>Saturdays</DATE> year round with double
cabin prices for a seven-day cruise starting at <MONEY>$895</MONEY> per person for an inside
or <MONEY>$1,095</MONEY> for an outside cabin, plus port and cruise taxes of about <MONEY>$50</MONEY>.
Alternatives include a three- or four-day cruise combined with three or four
days at a resort. Information: (800) 765-7000.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>
   <PERSON>Magdalena Barut</PERSON> didn't need the money, but she
was bored; tired of ``just chasing the chickens around the yard''
of the <LOCATION>Maui</LOCATION> home she has lived in since <DATE>1954</DATE>.
   So, on a whim, the 67-year-old Barut applied for a job at
<ORGANIZATION>McDonald's</ORGANIZATION>, figuring she would be rejected because of her age.
   But not only has <ORGANIZATION>McDonald's</ORGANIZATION> hired Barut and other senior
citizens like her, the nationwide hamburger chain also lets them
pick their own shifts, gives them 20 hours of training for just one
task _ Barut learned to make french fries _ and in some cases
drives them to and from work.
   ``I don't know I was worried about getting turned down,'' said
<PERSON>Barut</PERSON>, who has been promoted to running a cash register. ``I guess
we just didn't figure how desperate they are for workers around
here.''
   <ORGANIZATION>McDonalds</ORGANIZATION> _ which traditionally hires high school students for
part-time, minimum-wage jobs _ is only one of the many companies
facing a labor crunch in <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>.
   Businesses on the islands of <LOCATION>Oahu</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kauai</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Maui</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>,
especially those dependent on the ever-burgeoning tourist industry,
are scrambling for workers as the state's unemployment rate falls
to record lows and soon-to-open luxury resorts compete for the
existing work force.
   The state department of <ORGANIZATION>Labor and Industrial Relations</ORGANIZATION> reported
a statewide unemployment rate of just <PERCENT>3.3 percent</PERCENT> for <DATE>February</DATE>, the
most recent data available.
   ``Basically, everybody's got a job who wants one,'' according to
a spokeswoman from the <ORGANIZATION>Hawaii Visitors Bureau</ORGANIZATION>, who said the state's
reputation could suffer if hotels, restaurants and other
tourist-related businesses could not hire enough people to serve
their guests.
   ``The aloha spirit is one of the prime attractions of <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>,''
said the spokeswoman, who asked not to be named. ``If that begins
to change because there are not enough people to fill all the jobs,
we could have a serious problem.''
   A report by the labor department's Tourism and <ORGANIZATION>Training Council</ORGANIZATION>
projected an average of 6,400 workers would be needed each year to
meet job openings forecast for <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kauai</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Maui</LOCATION> counties
through <DATE>1995</DATE>. But the study found that after this year, only about
1,600 people _ or one-fourth the demand _ would enter the job
market each year until then.
   Those dim projections helped convince <ORGANIZATION>McDonalds</ORGANIZATION> to turn to
senior citizens to fill its employee gaps. Other companies have
taken more drastic measures.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Westin Maui Hotel</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Kaanapali</LOCATION>, in a joint venture with the
state, helps ferry workers from the nearby island of <LOCATION>Molokai</LOCATION>, where
a declining pineapple industry led to a <PERCENT>5.8 percent</PERCENT> unemployment
rate in <DATE>February</DATE>. Other businesses followed suit.
   ``<LOCATION>Maui</LOCATION> had a low unemployment rate and <LOCATION>Molokai</LOCATION> had a high one,
so we decided to work together,'' said <PERSON>Lindsey Geyer</PERSON>, the director
of human resources at the <LOCATION>Westin Maui</LOCATION>.
   Although many are basking in the glow of the state's ``full
employment,'' others say the prevalence of tourist-related jobs _
which account for about one third of the employment in the state _
means many residents earn less than they would in other industries.
Since <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>'s cost of living is about <PERCENT>26 percent</PERCENT> higher than the
national average, many people struggle to make ends meet.
   ``The islands may be paradise, but there also very expensive,''
said <PERSON>Geyer</PERSON>. Educators in the state are also concerned; they say
that because of the proliferation of jobs, young people who would
otherwise go to college are lured away to the work world.
   And economists say that full employment could trigger higher
inflation, because when businesses compete for employees _ offering
more pay and better fringe benefits _ the cost is ultimately passed
on to the consumer.
   Then, of course, there are the tourists.
   <DATE>1987</DATE> was a record year for tourism in the state, with about 5.7
million people visiting the islands, <PERCENT>3.3 percent</PERCENT> more than the year
before, according to the visitors bureau.
   ``Today's traveler and tomorrow's traveler want more service,
and that's labor intensive,'' said <PERSON>Dorothy Bremner</PERSON>, employment
analyst for the labor department's Tourism and <ORGANIZATION>Training Council</ORGANIZATION>.
   An obvious cure _ enticing more people to work and live here _
could be painful.
   ``Bringing people in presents plenty of other problems, and our
infrastruture is already overloaded,'' <PERSON>Bremner</PERSON> said. ``You'll find
very few people interested in making it any more crowded here.''
   A better solution, she says, is to upgrade the skills of the
people who already live here, and make jobs in the tourist industry
career opportunities rather than just average-wage occupations.

<DESCRIPT>  HAWAII; TRAVEL  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  HAWAII is an accessible safari, even for those of us who usually only daydream
of adventure. Let your friends return from a Hawaiian vacation to say they
have been to the famous places. You can come back with the kind of amazing
stories of nature that most people expect to find only on television
documentaries.;   That was what we discovered on a recent trip to two of the
Aloha State's most accessible islands: the Valley Island of Maui and the Big
Island of Hawaii.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Travel  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  THE BIG ISLAND IS A WORLD OF WONDER IN ONE FINE
SPOT  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Hawaii Special: Fire &amp; Water  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     You can watch active volcanoes ooze orange fire. Or experience the
mysterious way that black and lifeless lava deserts lie right next to lush
rain forests filled with thundering waterfalls. You can marvel at mountains
capped with snow -- then drive half an hour to sweltering, secluded beaches
made of black, red and even green sand. The ocean's crashing waves can tease
your senses as, just yards away, you soak quietly in natural pools of clear,
still and soothing water.;   Wide open spaces; The <LOCATION>Big Island</LOCATION> is often
overlooked by tourists -- but we found it amazing in its sheer volume of
natural wonders.;   They do not call it the <LOCATION>Big Island</LOCATION> just to distinguish it
from the state name itself. It's big -- all the other islands would fit on it
together with no problem. But it is open -- fewer than 100,000 people are
scattered through its 4,000 square miles -- and it is manageable. We drove 350
miles around its circumference in one very long but immensely satisfying day.;
  That is how we discovered that <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>, the island, holds a little of just
about everything that <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>, the state, has to offer. Actually, everything
the planet has to offer. Of Earth's 37 climate zones, 31 can be found on this
island.;   In <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION> Volcanoes National Park you can view huge, lunar-like
volcanic craters (not to mention active <LOCATION>Kilauea</LOCATION>), and then moments later be
hiking in surprisingly lush rain forests.;   Only the hardiest hikers can
reach <ORGANIZATION>Mauna Loa</ORGANIZATION>, at 13,677 feet the island's second-highest mountain. But
anyone can drive up <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>'s tallest peak, <PERSON>Mauna Kea</PERSON>, in the midst of a forest
reserve north of the national park. The world's largest observatory -- holding
10 huge telescopes -- takes advantage of the unspoiled atmosphere atop its
13,796 feet. The height also brings snow in the <DATE>winter</DATE> months; expert skiers
can make an expensive four-wheel-drive haul up to find untouched powder.;  
The road less traveled; The real appeal of the Hawaiian islands lies in the
sum total of dozens of small delights, the ones that can only be savored by
taking those detours down spur roads that look appealing and hiking up some
muddy trail just to see where it might lead.;   We learned this valuable
lesson in our earlier stop on <LOCATION>Maui</LOCATION>. You are likely to have heard of some of
its main attractions -- like the "road to Hana," a three-hour drive from the
resort towns over some of the twistiest, windiest coastal two-lanes imaginable
to an isolated little village on <LOCATION>Maui</LOCATION>'s windward side. It is inevitable that
you go, but you must think of it as a journey on the Hana Highway, not a road
to a place.;   Take the time to stop and savor its many nooks and crannies --
dozens of waterfalls, some creating ponds suitable for swimming; family fruit
stands offering reasonably priced refreshments and homemade souvenirs;
roadside mini-trails through bamboo forests and wild gardens of blazing exotic
flowers; quaint missionary churches from the <DATE>19th century</DATE>. We stumbled on a
grove of "rainbow" eucalyptus trees whose trunks were streaked with an amazing
array of bright pastel colors -- lavender, pink, chartreuse and orange.;  
Despite conventional wisdom, you do not absolutely have to backtrack from
<LOCATION>Hana</LOCATION>, either, although it is true that <LOCATION>Maui</LOCATION>'s paved roads run out pretty
quickly around the far side. We forged ahead a few miles to the much-touted
Seven Sacred Pools, which we learned were not considered sacred and are
considerably more than seven, stepping down from a stunning waterfall to the
ocean in quick succession down a rock gorge. It is almost a religious
experience, however, to take a dip in them, especially the final one, which is
protected from the raging ocean only by a short wall of stones.;   When we got
back to the continental <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> with two dozen rolls of landscape
pictures and stories of all those remote wonders of nature that we had managed
to discover, our friends said in amazement that it sounded like we had seen it
all.;   Gee, we thought -- we felt as though we had barely scratched the
surface.  </TEXT>

"HAWAII" (<PERSON>Rand McNally VideoTrips</PERSON>, Best Films and <ORGANIZATION>Video Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, 55 minutes, 
<DATE>1986</DATE>). This is a noble effort to show the highlights of the four major islands 
of <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION> -- <LOCATION>Oahu</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kauai</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Maui</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Big Island of Hawaii</LOCATION>, plus a brief 
overview of <LOCATION>Molokai</LOCATION> -- in less than an hour. Some attractions are given just a 
brief glance, but the good film quality and narration sprinkled with humor, 
legend and history make it a pleasant hour for the armchair traveler and a 
helpful tool for the first-time visitor. 
</P>
<P>
Oahu, the most-visited island, is shown first with familiar scenes of crowded, 
high-rise <LOCATION>Honolulu</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Waikiki Beach</LOCATION>, "where boy meets girl, grandmas meet the 
hula and middle-aged men suffer through days of holding their stomachs in." 
Other sights include <ORGANIZATION>Diamond Head</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Iolani Palace</ORGANIZATION> (the only royal palace in the 
<LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>), <ORGANIZATION>Bishop Museum</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Punchbowl Cemetery</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Sea Life Park</LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>U.S.S. 
Arizona Memorial</ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION>Pearl Harbor</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
A drive across the island takes viewers to visit the <ORGANIZATION>Polynesian Cultural 
Center</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>North Shore</ORGANIZATION> surfing beaches and <LOCATION>Waimea Falls Park</LOCATION>. Throughout, 
there are the requisite scenes of shoppers and souvenirs, luaus, hula dancing 
and night life. Information is given on many golf courses and their 
availability. 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>Kauai</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>Garden Isle</LOCATION>, with more than 400 inches of rain a year on its peaks, 
is the most verdant of the islands. The video visits three major resort areas 
-- Poipu/Lihue, Wailua/Kapaa and Princeville/Hanalei -- and takes a helicopter 
ride through "the Grand Canyon of the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION>," magnificent Waimea Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Other highlights include a boat ride on the <LOCATION>Wailua River</LOCATION> to the <PERSON>Fern Grotto</PERSON>, a 
stop at <ORGANIZATION>Kokee State Park</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Kilauae Lighthouse</PERSON> and aerial views of the isolated 
beaches along the majestic <ORGANIZATION>Na Pali Coast</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Maui offers still another face of <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>. Most of the action is in the historic 
whaling town of <LOCATION>Lahaina</LOCATION>. Low-rise shops, restaurants and discos line the main 
street. Other sights include the <ORGANIZATION>Pioneer Inn</ORGANIZATION>, built in <DATE>1901</DATE>; the old whaling 
ship, Carthaginian II, with its small museum, and the Whaler's Marketplace. The 
<ORGANIZATION>Lahaina &amp; Pacific Railroad</ORGANIZATION>, a restored relic of the sugar-cane era, is 
shown carrying passengers six miles to the high-rise hotels at <ORGANIZATION>Kaanapali</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Viewers visit beautiful gardens and accompany bike riders down the side of the 
dormant volcano, <LOCATION>Mt. Haleakala</LOCATION>. They also drive past the <LOCATION>Iao Needle</LOCATION> and visit 
the town of Hana and the nearby Seven Sacred Pools. <LOCATION>Lahaina</LOCATION> also is where 
viewers take off for a brief visit to <LOCATION>Molokai</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The <LOCATION>Big Island</LOCATION> of <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION> combines a bit of everything found on the other 
islands, plus a few extras of its own: active volcanoes, mountains with snow 
for skiing and <ORGANIZATION>Porter Ranch</ORGANIZATION>, the largest privately owned cattle ranch in the 
<LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Other sights include a visit to orchid gardens, <ORGANIZATION>Hawaii Volcanoes National Park</ORGANIZATION>, 
black-sand beaches and a marlin fishing trip. Across the island at <LOCATION>Kailua-Kona</LOCATION> 
there are stops at the <ORGANIZATION>King Kamehameha Royal Compound</ORGANIZATION> and a drive along the 
<ORGANIZATION>Kona Coast</ORGANIZATION> to the Capt. <PERSON>James Cook Monument</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
The final segment of the video is a roundup of travel information on 
transportation, weather and accommodations. The film shows a selection of 
hotels, with descriptions of their special features. These are not paid 
commercials. Though of little concern to the armchair traveler, trip planners 
should be reminded that these hotel selections were made in <DATE>1986</DATE>.

<P>
"HAWAII" (<ORGANIZATION>Fodor</ORGANIZATION>'s Video Travel Guide, <DATE>1988</DATE>, 75 minutes). Fodor's video format 
follows the style of its travel guidebooks. 
</P>
<P>
The first of three segments (about one-third of the video) is a typical 
travelogue giving the viewer a look at many of the islands' popular tourist 
attractions. Most can be seen in any video on <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>, including <PERSON>Rand McNally</PERSON>'s 
"<LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>" (see above). 
</P>
<P>
What makes this video different is that it emphasizes practical information 
provided by authorities in the field. It gives tips on such things as the care 
of valuables, exchange rates, use of credit cards and traveler's checks. 
Another segment helps business people master communications devices such as fax 
machines and telexes. This is followed by facts on weather, clothes, 
inter-island transportation, package tours and photo opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the information provided is general to all Fodor videos and not 
applicable in this case. For example, railroad information provided is 
irrelevant as <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION> has no railroad system. 
</P>
<P>
The video concludes with an extensive guide to hotels, from moderate to 
super-deluxe. The list provides hotel location and information on amenities 
such as restaurants, wheelchair access and pools. These are not paid 
commercials. 
</P>
<P>
Also provided is a helpful pocket guide that indexes items on the videotape. It 
contains maps and a glossary of Hawaiian terms.

<P>
"DESTINATION MOLOKAI" (Destination <ORGANIZATION>Molokai Assn.</ORGANIZATION>, 15 minutes, <DATE>1989</DATE>). The beauty 
and attractions of the relatively undeveloped Hawaiian island of <LOCATION>Molokai</LOCATION> are 
given comprehensive, if brief, coverage in this tourist promotion video. For 
travel planners, the narration provides information on transportation to and on 
the island, and maps locate the principal sites. (Note: <ORGANIZATION>Air Molokai</ORGANIZATION> has 
discontinued service since the video was filmed.) 
</P>
<P>
There are scenes of lush tropical foliage, waterfalls, nearly deserted beaches, 
open plains and aerial views along the 3,330-foot sea cliffs, the world's 
highest. 
</P>
<P>
Viewers also are shown a selection of hotels, cottages, inns and condominiums, 
given information on their amenities as well as some of the activities 
available. These include helicopter tours, boat cruises, horseback rides, a 
mule ride down to Father <PERSON>Damien</PERSON>'s old leper colony on <LOCATION>Kalaupapa Peninsula</LOCATION> and a 
hike to <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>'s tallest waterfall in the lovely <LOCATION>Halawa Valley</LOCATION>, where trekkers 
cool off in the pool at the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
Other sights covered are the 13th-Century fish ponds, the royal coconut grove, 
petroglyphs, a macadamia nut farm and <ORGANIZATION>Molokai Ranch Wildlife Park</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The video concludes with a quick tour of the main street of <LOCATION>Kaunakakai</LOCATION>, 
<LOCATION>Molokai</LOCATION>'s largest town. 
</P>
<P>
The film quality is very good and the video is a useful source of information 
for those considering a visit to <LOCATION>Molokai</LOCATION>, "The Friendly Isle."

Tapes are available from <LOCATION>Destination Molokai</LOCATION>, 1600 <LOCATION>Kapiolani Blvd.</LOCATION>, Suite 923,

<HEAD>`Hot Spot' Forms Hawaii Islands</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BEN DIPIETRO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HONOLULU (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hawaiian folklore tells of the movements of the
volcano goddess Pele from one island to another. Without knowing
it, the tellers of these tales were chronicling the scientific
process that formed the Hawaiian archipelago.
   Legend has it that Pele was being chased from island to island
by her sister and nemesis, <PERSON>Na Maka o Kahai</PERSON>, goddess of the sea. In
reality, the ``chase'' was the formation of the islands, part of a
900-mile string of volcanoes that have been active on the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION>
plate for 70 million years.
   These volcanic islands were formed after passing over a ``hot
spot'' in the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s mantle that remains in a fixed location under
the plate, said <PERSON>Reggie Okamura</PERSON>, who has studied volcanoes at the
<ORGANIZATION>U.S. Geological Survey</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Hawaiian Volcano Observatory</ORGANIZATION> for 32 years.
   This hot spot remelts the portion of the rock passing over it,
creating magma. The intense heat forces the magma to rise through
the crust. The new magma builds on the previous eruptions in a
layered fashion to form massive undersea mountains whose tips
eventually rise above sea level and become islands, he said. These
are known as shield volcanoes because of their gently sloping
contours.
   ``The process that's happening now pretty much is what happened
earlier to form the other islands,'' <PERSON>Okamura</PERSON> said.
   The <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> plate is moving northwesterly at a rate of about
four inches a year, <PERSON>Okamura</PERSON> said. Each island _ beginning with
<LOCATION>Kauai</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Niihau</LOCATION> and followed by <ORGANIZATION>Oahu</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Molokai</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Lanai</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Maui</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION> _ were active volcanoes at one time.
   A large portion of <LOCATION>Hawaii Island</LOCATION>, the youngest in the chain,
currently sits over the hot spot. It is the island's location that
presently accounts for the volcanic activity at <LOCATION>Kilauea</LOCATION>, which has
been in continuous eruption since <DATE>1983</DATE>. About 160 acres of new land
have been created as a result, <PERSON>Okamura</PERSON> said.
   Three of <LOCATION>Hawaii Island</LOCATION>'s five volcanoes have been active in the
last 200 years. The other two, which already have passed over the
hot spot, have been dormant for 3,000 and 6,000 years, respectively.
   Scientists say a new seamount is forming southeast of <LOCATION>Hawaii
Island</LOCATION> and is about 600 feet below the surface. When it breaks sea
level, thousands of years from now, <LOCATION>Loihi</LOCATION> will be the newest
Hawaiian island, <PERSON>Okamura</PERSON> said.
   The process that forms <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>'s volcanoes is different from the
one that forms volcanoes on the continental <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, such as
<ORGANIZATION>Mount St. Helens</ORGANIZATION>, which blew its top off in a spectacular eruption
in <DATE>1980</DATE>.
   The Cascade range that includes <ORGANIZATION>Mount St. Helens</ORGANIZATION> was formed by
the subduction of the <ORGANIZATION>Juan de Fuca</ORGANIZATION> plate with the <ORGANIZATION>North American
Continental</ORGANIZATION> plate. As the <ORGANIZATION>Juan de Fuca</ORGANIZATION> plate is pushed deeper into
the earth, the friction melts the rock to form highly pressurized
magma that can be released with explosive force, <PERSON>Okamura</PERSON> said.
   While lava from <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>'s volcanoes sometimes shoots hundreds of
feet into the air, it's unlikely enough pressure could be built up
to cause such a violent eruption as the one at <LOCATION>Mount St. Helens</LOCATION>, he
said.
   Magma _ called lava only after it reaches the surface _ moves
through the island's volcanoes via a series of tubes and vents. The
tubes are formed when the crust over a lava flow cools, thickens
and stops moving. The rest of the lava continues to pass under it.
   The tubes and vents are created by a system of dykes and sills.
Most of these are found in fractured areas of the volcano known as
rift zones. Lava also can flow over the volcano's crater, or
caldera, <PERSON>Okamura</PERSON> said.
   There are two kinds of lava _ pahoehoe and a'a _ identical in
chemical composition. Pahoehoe lava is black and smooth and
swift-moving. A'a lava is rougher, more fragmented and
slower-moving. Most lava erupts as pahoehoe, with some changing to
a'a as its temperature and gas content decrease. The lava mainly is
composed of silica, iron, magnesium, calcium, potassium, sodium and
other minerals, <PERSON>Okamura</PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Honolulu-Bound Jet Diverted Because of Fuel Leak</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONOLULU (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Honolulu-bound jumbo jet with 205 people
aboard developed a fuel leak over the <LOCATION>Pacific Ocean</LOCATION>, but landed
safely early <DATE>Monday</DATE> after being diverted to <LOCATION>Hilo</LOCATION>, authorities said.
   Pilots shut down the <ORGANIZATION>TWA</ORGANIZATION> airliner's left wing engine when fuel
began leaking from the wing, said <PERSON>Don Morrison</PERSON>, an airline
spokesman in <LOCATION>St. Louis</LOCATION>.
   ``The captain was not able to do anything to stop the leak, and
made a precautionary landing in <LOCATION>Hilo</LOCATION>,'' <PERSON>Morrison</PERSON> said.
   <ORGANIZATION>TWA</ORGANIZATION> Flight 235, bound from <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, reported it was low on
fuel and 450 miles out of <LOCATION>Honolulu</LOCATION> at <TIME>11:30 p.m. HST</TIME> <DATE>Sunday</DATE>,
according to <PERSON>Dick Hallen</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Federal Aviation Administration</ORGANIZATION> duty
officer in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>.
   The L-1011 was instructed to divert to <LOCATION>Hilo International
Airport</LOCATION> on <LOCATION>Hawaii Island</LOCATION>, southernmost and easternmost in the
Hawaiian chain and more than 200 miles from <LOCATION>Honolulu</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Hallen</PERSON> said.
   The plane landed safely at <TIME>12:40 a.m.</TIME>, escorted by two F-15 jet
fighters from the <ORGANIZATION>Hawaii Air National Guard</ORGANIZATION> and a <ORGANIZATION>Coast Guard</ORGANIZATION> C-130
search-and-rescue airplane, according to <PERSON>Christopher Kimbrough</PERSON>, a
spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION>Joint Rescue Coordination Center</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Honolulu</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Marilyn Kali</PERSON>, a state <ORGANIZATION>Transportation Department</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman,
said fire-crash rescue workers could see fuel leaking after the
plane landed. The landing, however, was described as routine.
   <PERSON>Morrison</PERSON> said the cause of the leak was under investigtion.
   The plane carried 190 passengers and 15 crew members. The
passengers were brought to <LOCATION>Honolulu</LOCATION> aboard a chartered plane,
<PERSON>Morrison</PERSON> said.

<DATE>April 2</DATE>. Their luxury car was found in a downtown <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> alley
with most of their belongings undisturbed and the keys still in the
ignition.
   Police initially suspected the couple had met with foul play.
But some of the circumstances surrounding their disappearance _
they were married secretly about a week earlier _ led to
speculation they may have eloped.
   Commander <PERSON>Ettore DiVito</PERSON>, who is heading the investigation, said
the book, ``Hidden <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>: The Adventurer's Guide'' was checked out
of the <LOCATION>Wheaton</LOCATION> library on <DATE>March 29</DATE> and was found <DATE>Saturday</DATE> in <LOCATION>St.
Paul</LOCATION>.
   Although <PERSON>DiVito</PERSON> decline to chacterize the find as a
``breakthrough'' in the investigation, when he was asked whether
police believed the couple may have been in <LOCATION>St. Paul</LOCATION> and headed for
<LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>, he replied: `It's a possibility. We're checking out both
possibilities.
   ``We're sending flyers to <ORGANIZATION>St. Paul</ORGANIZATION>, to the missing persons
division of their police department and we're making contact with
the appropriate authorities in <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>,'' <PERSON>DiVito</PERSON> said.
   Acquaintances have told police the two were saving money for a
trip before their disappearance, that <PERSON>Ms. MacLean</PERSON> had recently
purchased <MONEY>$600</MONEY> worth of clothes and some excerpts found in her
diary were about trips to exotic locales.
   The couple was to have arrived at the <PERSON>Swanson</PERSON> family home in
<DATE>Elgin the night of April 2</DATE> after visiting <PERSON>Ms. MacLean</PERSON>'s grandmother
in <LOCATION>Flint</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mich</LOCATION>.

   <LOCATION>Hawaii Island</LOCATION> beach parks were closed <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> in
anticipation of heavy surf from <LOCATION>Hurricane Dalilia</LOCATION>, and residents
were urged to stock up on emergency supplies, although the storm
appeared to turn away.
   At <TIME>2 p.m. HST</TIME> <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, the hurricane was 450 miles southeast of
<LOCATION>Hilo</LOCATION>, on <LOCATION>Hawaii Island</LOCATION>, moving slightly north of a westerly course
at 12 mph, the <ORGANIZATION>National Weather Service</ORGANIZATION> said. Its maximum sustained
wind speed was 75 mph; a storm is classified a hurricane when that
speed reaches 74 mph. Wind gusted to 90 mph.
   The weather service said it was too early to tell whether the
slight shift north portended a significant change in course or
whether it meant <PERSON>Dalilia</PERSON> had a ``wobbling eye,'' a fairly common
phenomenon among hurricanes.
   If the hurricane took a more northwesterly course, it would pass
closer to the southern coasts of the islands, the service said in a
statement.
   Earlier in the day, data provided by the crew of an <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION>
hurricane-hunting airplane indicated the hurricane's center was
slightly farther south than it was <DATE>Monday</DATE>, said <PERSON>Clarence Lee</PERSON>, head
of the <ORGANIZATION>Central Pacific Hurricane Center</ORGANIZATION> here.
   If it continued on the track determined by the airplane, Dalilia
would pass 250 miles south of <LOCATION>Hawaii Island</LOCATION>, southernmost in the
Hawaiian chain, <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME>, <PERSON>Lee</PERSON> said.
   Dalilia's rapid westerly movement had slowed by nearly half from
20 mph during a 24-hour period, he added.
   ``Dalilia's current location and apparent movement is a favorable
sign for <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>,'' <PERSON>Lee</PERSON> said. ``If the trend continues, the hurricane
may pass far south of the island chain and the only effect ... would
be an increase in surf along the southern coasts of the islands.''
   A tropical storm watch remained in effect for <LOCATION>Hawaii Island</LOCATION>,
meaning wind up to 73 mph and heavy rain were possible if Dalilia
moved farther north than expected.
   <LOCATION>Hawaii Island</LOCATION> residents were urged to stock up on batteries,
canned goods and other emergency supplies in case the storm veered
northward.
   A high surf advisory was issued for beaches along the south shore
of <LOCATION>Hawaii Island</LOCATION>, southernmost in the Hawaiian chain, in
anticipation of waves as high as 15 feet.
   ``We're going to be keeping these beaches closed as a
precautionary measure,'' said <PERSON>Bruce Butts</PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION>Hawaii
County Civil Defense</ORGANIZATION>. ``The tides are pretty high. That will make
surf especially dangerous.''

<HEAD>Fore! Hawaii Leaders Seek Huge Fees From Golf Course Developers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRUCE DUNFORD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HONOLULU (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japanese demand for golf, <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>'s sunny climate
and a limited supply of land for housing have political leaders
here asking for up to <MONEY>$100 million</MONEY> as par for the course.
   The idea to charge golf course developers ``community impact
fees'' to pay for rental housing has drawn support of Gov. <PERSON>John
Waihee</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Honolulu</LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON>Frank Fasi</PERSON>.
   Supporters call it a way to force developers - who stand to make
huge profits exploiting <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>'s limited land - to give something
back to the community. Critics say it's a tempting but legally
questionable scheme to tax developers under the guise of state and
county land-use regulations.
   With about 50 golf courses being proposed statewide by various
developers - many of them Japanese - proceeds to the local
government under the plan could climb well into the billions of
dollars. Some developers are ready to pay.
   <ORGANIZATION>Jurigi Co.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> agreed to pay Honolulu <MONEY>$111 million</MONEY> for a
just-completed <MONEY>$40 million</MONEY> municipal golf course near <LOCATION>Pearl Harbor</LOCATION>
and <MONEY>$200 million</MONEY> more in community impact fees for permission to
build two more courses on <LOCATION>Oahu</LOCATION>, where <LOCATION>Honolulu</LOCATION> is located.
   The <ORGANIZATION>City Council</ORGANIZATION> rejected the proposal, but its chairman, <PERSON>Arnold
Morgado</PERSON>, agrees with the concept.
   In <DATE>September</DATE>, <PERSON>Morgado</PERSON>, the governor and the mayor said golf
courses take up land that could be used for housing, and ``require
large tracts of undeveloped land at or near locations which have
scenic, recreational or cultural significance to the community.''
<PERSON>Fasi</PERSON> said the fees would be subject to negotiation.
   <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>'s leaders are trying to cash in on high-priced
memberships in <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION> golf courses being peddled in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>.
   For instance, <ORGANIZATION>Shinwa Golf Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, owner of the <ORGANIZATION>Wailea Resort</ORGANIZATION> on
the island of <LOCATION>Maui</LOCATION>, has offered Japanese citizens 1,000 memberships
at <MONEY>$115,000</MONEY> each in a new Wailea golf course.
   University of <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION> Professor <PERSON>David Callies</PERSON>, an expert on
land-use law, said impact fees have been found unconstitutional
when they exceed a development's actual effect on such things as
roads, sewers and the environment.
   ``Impact fees are not revenue-raising tools and golf courses are
appropriate open space uses in the right places,'' <PERSON>Callies</PERSON> said.
   ``It is difficult to see how a golf course generates <MONEY>$100
million</MONEY> in infrastructure costs, which is the sole legal basis for
charging such a fee,'' he said.
   <PERSON>Dan Davidson</PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION>Land Use Research
Foundation</ORGANIZATION>, a research and trade organization for landowners and
developers, said impact fees are tempting from a fiscal standpoint.
   ``It is, however, a tax and the city has no authority to impose
this sort of tax in the guise of a land-use regulation,'' he said.
   <PERSON>Harold Masumoto</PERSON>, director of the state's planning office, said
<LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION> could avoid the potential problem of linking golf course
fees to actual impacts by entering into development agreements.
   That way it would not be an impact fee, but a mutual agreement
by the developer to make a contribution to a rental housing fund,
he said.
   In <DATE>1988</DATE>, the state <ORGANIZATION>Land Use Commission</ORGANIZATION> decided that major
developers had to make <PERCENT>60 percent</PERCENT> of their homes ``affordable'' for
low- and middle-income families.
   In <DATE>August</DATE>, the same group for the first time imposed the
governor's new policy of requiring hotel and resort developers to
create one non-tourism job for every hotel room they build, or pay
the state <MONEY>$25,000</MONEY> per room.
   <PERSON>Wali Osman</PERSON>, director of research for the real estate firm <ORGANIZATION>Monroe
&amp; Friedlander Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, said the trend is a result of the state's
frustration in handling housing problems and diversifying the
economy through traditional means. He said exactions from
developers won't solve the housing problems.
   The state is going ahead anyway.
   Last month, the <ORGANIZATION>Board of Land and Natural Resources</ORGANIZATION> proposed
that <ORGANIZATION>Minami Group USA</ORGANIZATION> pay <MONEY>$15 million</MONEY> in impact fees in exchange
for extending a permit to complete a <MONEY>$100 million</MONEY> golf course on
land zoned for conservation use. The extension was needed because
rain had delayed construction.
   An attorney for <PERSON>Minami</PERSON> told the board he doubted the legality of
the new proposed assessments, but said his client wanted to be ``a
responsible neighbor'' and was willing to work with the state and
local groups.

   A <ORGANIZATION>TWA</ORGANIZATION> jumbo jet made an emergency landing after
developing a fuel leak and running low on fuel, and airline
officials said they weren't sure how close it came to a forced
ditching in the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION>.
   <ORGANIZATION>TWA</ORGANIZATION>'s Flight 235, bound from <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Honolulu</LOCATION> with 205
people aboard, landed early <DATE>Monday</DATE> at <LOCATION>Hilo International Airport</LOCATION> on
the island of <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>, 200 miles southeast of <LOCATION>Honolulu</LOCATION>, because it
was the closest airport, said <ORGANIZATION>TWA</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>Don Morrison</PERSON> in <LOCATION>St.
Louis</LOCATION>.
   Asked about a televised news report here that the Lockheed
L-1011 had about four minutes of fuel left when it landed, <PERSON>Morrison</PERSON>
said that had not been determined.
   Passenger <PERSON>Domenic Silvestri</PERSON> said he could hear crewmembers
behind a curtain reviewing ditching procedures.
   The pilot reported at <TIME>11:30 p.m. HST</TIME> <DATE>Sunday</DATE> that the jet was low
on fuel and 450 miles out of <LOCATION>Honolulu</LOCATION>, and was instructed to divert
to <LOCATION>Hilo</LOCATION>, said <PERSON>Dick Hallen</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Federal Aviation Administration</ORGANIZATION> duty
officer in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>.
   Going to <LOCATION>Hilo</LOCATION> cut about 110 miles off the flight, according to
an <ORGANIZATION>FAA</ORGANIZATION> calculation.
   <PERSON>Morrison</PERSON> said the plane's left engine was shut down after the
crew realized fuel was leaking from the wing.
   ``The captain was not able to do anything to stop the leak,'' he
said.
   Passengers said they were only told that something was wrong
with the left engine.
   Two F-15 fighters from the <ORGANIZATION>Hawaii Air National Guard</ORGANIZATION> and a <ORGANIZATION>Coast
Guard</ORGANIZATION> C-130 search-and-rescue airplane escorted the <ORGANIZATION>TWA</ORGANIZATION> plane to
<LOCATION>Hilo</LOCATION>, where it made a routine landing at <TIME>12:40 a.m.</TIME>, said
<PERSON>Christopher Kimbrough</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Joint Rescue Coordination Center</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Honolulu</LOCATION>.
   Fire-crash rescue crews could see fuel leaking from the wing
after it landed, said <PERSON>Marilyn Kali</PERSON>, a state <ORGANIZATION>Transportation
Department</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman.
   <PERSON>Morrison</PERSON> said the cause of the leak was under investigation.
   The 190 passengers, including rock singer <PERSON>Bobby Brown</PERSON>, were kept
at the <LOCATION>Hilo</LOCATION> airport terminal until dawn when they were put on
chartered jets to take them to <LOCATION>Honolulu</LOCATION>.
   ``It was rough, but I'm glad we got home safely. I'm glad the
Lord brought us here,'' said <PERSON>Brown</PERSON>, who came for a series of
concerts.
   However, he and other passengers complained about their
treatment at <LOCATION>Hilo</LOCATION>.
   ``It was like being held hostage, you know, by your own people,
by <ORGANIZATION>TWA</ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON>Brown</PERSON> said.
   Other passengers complained they were given no food or drink and
had to contend with dirty restrooms during their wait.

<LEADPARA>  FOR six minutes on the morning of July 11 on the Big Island of Hawaii, all
eyes will be on the heavens. That is the day the moon and sun will cross,
creating a total eclipse of the sun.;    Upward of 20,000 visitors are
expected on the Big Island for the phenomenon, which will not be visible from
the same location for another 360 years. Many more people will settle for the

<LEADPARA>  THE Big Island of Hawaii has launched a campaign to attract new waves of
tourists. A lineup of locals calling themselves BIG (Big Island Group) has
installed an 800 hot line. Callers get a 16-page brochure containing
background on accommodations, beaches, sightseeing, tips on visiting Kilauea,
updates on the Kohala Coast and more. Call (800) 648-2441.;   Besides hotels
and resorts, the Big Island is heavy into bed-and-breakfast businesses.
Barbara Campbell, a familiar figure for years at the popular Kona Village,
will put you into B&amp;Bs at dozens of locations. Besides the Big Island,
Campbell represents 60 B&amp;Bs on Oahu, Kauai, Maui and Molokai. Campbell
personally inspects each property. And she's fussy. Next door to her own home
on Hawaii at Kamuela, Campbell operates a charming B&amp;B in a cottage featuring
two units ($90 to $95) with their own kitchen facilities.  </LEADPARA>

<HEAD>Politicians, Pentagon Weigh Target Bombing of Island off Maui</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BEN DIPIETRO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HONOLULU (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The bombing of <LOCATION>Kahoolawe</LOCATION> has stopped. The
question is, for how long?
   Use of the pockmarked, 27,000-acre island by the military for
target practice has been suspended for two years. The political
maneuvering over who ultimately will get control of <LOCATION>Kahoolawe</LOCATION> is
just beginning.
   The dry, mostly barren island 10 miles west of <LOCATION>Maui</LOCATION> has been
ravaged by 49 years of conventional bombing by <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> planes and
warships. Some historical sites have been damaged, the landscape
has been scarred and topsoil has been lost to erosion caused by
bombs and grazing goats and sheep. The bombing has also been a
source of deep pain for native Hawaiians who view the island, with
its ancient shrines, as a sacred place.
   The former penal colony and cattle ranch was seized by the <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION>
in <DATE>1941</DATE> after <LOCATION>Pearl Harbor</LOCATION>. Kahoolawe had been used for target
bombing since <DATE>1953</DATE>, until President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> signed the <DATE>1991</DATE> Defense
Appropriations Bill on <DATE>Nov. 5</DATE>.
   The bill contained an amendment sponsored by <PERSON>Sen. Daniel Akaka</PERSON>,
<LOCATION>D-Hawaii</LOCATION>, that puts a halt to the bombing for two years. The law
also established a commission to help determine the best way to
return the island to the state.
   But the threat of war in the <LOCATION>Middle East</LOCATION> has military officials
pressing for limited use of the island. Some who worked to halt the
bombing worry that <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> may issue an executive order permitting
military use of the island if war begins with <ORGANIZATION>Iraq</ORGANIZATION>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Kahoolawe Island Conveyance Commission</ORGANIZATION> includes two
appointees from Gov. <PERSON>John Waihee</PERSON>, two <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> appointees and an
appointee from the <ORGANIZATION>Office of Hawaiian Affairs</ORGANIZATION>. The commission's
first meeting was scheduled for today.
   The panel can recommend a ban on all military use or allow the
military unlimited or partial access to the island. The three
non-Navy appointees oppose any bombing. The panel's recommendations
are subject to approval by <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>.
   Cmdr. <PERSON>Joel Keefer</PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Pacific Command</ORGANIZATION>,
said <LOCATION>Kahoolawe</LOCATION> is needed to train troops for the long term, not
just for Operation Desert Shield.
   ``Kahoolawe offers us the only place for the kind of training we
need to perform ... aircraft, gunfire support, amphibious
landings,'' <PERSON>Keefer</PERSON> said. ``We have forces in the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> and we
need to train them where they are.''
   Sen. <PERSON>Daniel Inouye</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-Hawaii</LOCATION>, has flip-flopped on the the issue
twice in recent months. He was a longtime advocate of the
military's use of <LOCATION>Kahoolawe</LOCATION>, then came out in support of <LOCATION>Akaka</LOCATION>'s
bill before the <DATE>November</DATE> election and pledged to work for the
return of the island to <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>.
   Last week, he said the island is needed to train troops for
Operation Desert Shield.
   Inouye's reversal ``disappointed many of us,'' said <PERSON>Dr. Noa
Emmett Aluli</PERSON>, co-founder of the Protect <PERSON>Kahoolawe Ohana</PERSON> and a
member of the commission. Aluli helped form the Protect <PERSON>Kahoolawe
Ohana</PERSON> in <DATE>1975</DATE> and has taken part in several ``occupations'' of the
island to prevent target bombing.
   <PERSON>Aluli</PERSON> said the island holds a special spiritual and cultural
significance to native Hawaiians. Ancient Hawaiians were the only
people ever to inhabit the island. There are fishing shrines,
agricultural shrines, major temples and housing sites, which have
landed <LOCATION>Kahoolawe</LOCATION> on the <ORGANIZATION>National Register of Historic Places</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``The history of our ancient Hawaiian people is intact on
<LOCATION>Kahoolawe</LOCATION>,'' <PERSON>Aluli</PERSON> said. ``No way will I allow a resumption of
bombing.''
   Maui Mayor <PERSON>Hannibal Tavares</PERSON>, another commission member, said as
the western part of <LOCATION>Maui</LOCATION> becomes more populated bombing of
<LOCATION>Kahoolawe</LOCATION> becomes more dangerous because errant shells can strike
the cities of <LOCATION>Lahaina</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Kihei</LOCATION>.
   Tavares and others say the military has better sites to train
personnel for a desert war, including desert areas near bases in
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>.
   It's unclear how much it would cost to restore the island.
   <PERSON>Aluli</PERSON> said the government should find money to ``green'' the
island back to its natural state, whatever the cost.

   A tropical storm watch was posted for the
120,000 residents of <LOCATION>Hawaii Island</LOCATION> as a ``dangerous'' Hurricane
Fabio and its 125 mph gusts churned toward the <LOCATION>Hawaiian Islands</LOCATION>
<DATE>today</DATE>, forecasters said.
   At <TIME>2 a.m.</TIME> <DATE>today</DATE> (<TIME>8 a.m. EDT</TIME>) the storm's center was 530 miles
east-southeast of <LOCATION>Hilo</LOCATION> and 740 miles east-southeast of <LOCATION>Honolulu</LOCATION>,
with a course and speed that would bring it just south of <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>,
the southernmost island in the chain, on <DATE>Friday</DATE>.
   If the course and speed remained unchanged, it would be near
<LOCATION>Oahu</LOCATION>, the most populous island of 850,000 where <LOCATION>Honolulu</LOCATION> is
located, on <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, forecasters said.
   Maximum sustained winds were 105 mph, with tropical force winds
between 39 mph and 73 mph extending 180 miles from the center. The
intensity diminished from early <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> when gusts reached 175
mph.
   ``It's a large storm and quite intense,'' said <PERSON>Hans Rosendal</PERSON>, a
meteorologist with the <ORGANIZATION>National Weather Service</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Honolulu</LOCATION>.
   ``It likely will come quite close to the islands. It is still a
dangerous storm.''
   A track up the chain's western side would bring the more intense
and dangerous side of the storm over the islands, he said.
   Although the storm had not weakened in six hours, <PERSON>Rosendal</PERSON> said
storms usually diminish in strength as they move away from the
equator and over cooler waters.
   Supermarkets contacted around the state <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> said they had
not noticed any big rush to buy items as batteries, candles,
charcoal or canned goods that <ORGANIZATION>Civil Defense</ORGANIZATION> officials advised
residents to have on hand.
   Observers assigned to spend <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> on <LOCATION>Hawaii Island</LOCATION>'s
east coast to watch for rising surf generated by the approaching
storm reported no problems, said <PERSON>Bruce Butts</PERSON>, operations officer
for the <ORGANIZATION>Hawaii County Civil Defense</ORGANIZATION>.
   The last major storm to hit <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION> was Hurricane Iwa, which
skirted <LOCATION>Oahu</LOCATION> and ran over <LOCATION>Kauai</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Niihau</LOCATION> in <DATE>November 1982</DATE> with
117 mph winds, causing <MONEY>$234 million</MONEY> damage. There were no deaths
officially attributed to that storm.

   A hurricane with reduced top winds of 100 mph
spun toward <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION> <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, bringing the threat of high waves and
warnings to stay off the beach.
   Hurricane <PERSON>Marie</PERSON>, was centered about 380 miles east-southeast of
<LOCATION>Hilo</LOCATION> on the island of <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION> <DATE>Sunday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME>, and showed more
signs of weakening, the <ORGANIZATION>National Weather Service</ORGANIZATION> said.
   Sustained winds near its eye fell to 80 mph, with top gusts
reaching 100 mph. The hurricane was expected to be downgraded to
tropical storm status <DATE>Sunday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> once sustained winds dropped
below 75 mph, forecaster <PERSON>Tim Craig</PERSON> said.
   Gale force winds, which range from 39 mph to 54 mph, extended
150 miles from the center of the hurricane. Waves kicked up by the
storm were expected to reach <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>, known as the <LOCATION>Big Island</LOCATION>, late
<DATE>Sunday</DATE> or early <DATE>Monday</DATE>, the weather service said.
   All ocean and beach activities along the southern and eastern
coasts of <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION> should be halted because of the high surf danger,
<ORGANIZATION>Hawaii County Civil Defense</ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON>Harry Kim</PERSON> said.
   Hurricane <PERSON>Marie</PERSON>, moving westward at about 10 mph, would pass
about 70 miles off the southern tip of <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION> on <DATE>Monday</DATE> if it
maintains its course and speed. On <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> it would pass about 200
miles south of <LOCATION>Oahu</LOCATION>, the island where <LOCATION>Honolulu</LOCATION> is located, the
weather service said.
   To monitor rising surf, residents along the affected coastlines
will maintain a watch and report to <ORGANIZATION>Civil Defense</ORGANIZATION> officials, <PERSON>Kim</PERSON>
said.
   The last major storm to hit the Hawaiian islands was Hurricane
Iwa, which struck on <DATE>Nov. 24, 1982</DATE> and caused <MONEY>$234 million</MONEY> damage,
primarily to the islands of <LOCATION>Oahu</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Kauai</LOCATION>.

   A mysterious explosion ripped open an
<ORGANIZATION>Aloha Airlines</ORGANIZATION> jet ``like a convertible'' at 24,000 feet, injuring
60 people and throwing or blowing a flight attendant to her death
before the pilot landed safely.
   ``There was big bang when it happened and everybody looked up
and we were looking at blue sky,'' said passenger <PERSON>Bill Fink</PERSON> of
<LOCATION>Honolulu</LOCATION>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Boeing</ORGANIZATION> 737, with one of its two engines aflame and about 15
to 20 feet of its cabin exposed behind the cockpit and down to the
level of the passenger seats, flew for 25 miles after the blast and
made an emergency landing at <LOCATION>Kahului Airport</LOCATION> at <TIME>2 p.m.</TIME> <DATE>Thursday</DATE> (<TIME>8
p.m. EDT</TIME>), airline officials said.
   The cause of the blast on <ORGANIZATION>Aloha</ORGANIZATION> Flight 243 was unknown <DATE>Thursday</DATE>
<TIME>night</TIME>, said <PERSON>Kevin Morimatsu</PERSON>, a spokesman for the state <ORGANIZATION>Department
of Transportation</ORGANIZATION>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>National Transportation Safety Board</ORGANIZATION> was sending
investigators to the scene and <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> agents were sent from <LOCATION>Honolulu</LOCATION>
to determine whether the blast was caused by a bomb, said <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION>
spokesman <PERSON>Robert Heafner</PERSON>.
   However, sources close to the federal investigation in
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> said investigators were focusing most heavily on a
possible structural failure that may have been caused by a rapid
decompression and that the force of strong wind at 24,000 feet may
then have ripped away the huge section of fuselage. The sources
spoke on condition they not be identified.
   <PERSON>George Harvey</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Federal Aviation Administration</ORGANIZATION> area coordinator
for <LOCATION>Honolulu</LOCATION>, said <DATE>today</DATE> he could not confirm whether federal
investigators suspected that a structural failure caused the
fuselage to tear away from the airplane.
   ``It stands to reason that they're checking everything _
structure failure, explosive devices,'' <PERSON>Harvey</PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION>NTSB</ORGANIZATION>
investigators will hold their first news conference later today, he
said.
   Another passenger, <PERSON>Alice Godwin</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Boulder City</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Nev.</LOCATION>, said she
put on a life jacket and put her head between her knees. ``I sang
all the hymns I knew,'' she said. ``That kept me busy.''
   ``Everybody screamed,'' said <PERSON>Dan Dennin</PERSON>, also of <LOCATION>Honolulu</LOCATION>.
``However, it was very brief _ the panic. ... The rest of the plane
was intact, and we did not go into any unusual attitudes or
anything like that. I think that people realized the plane was
still flying and they quickly went about the business of doing
whatever they could do to save their lives.''
   Passenger <PERSON>Daniel Westfall</PERSON>, of <LOCATION>Novato</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, said the plane
``jerked around, up and down.''
   <PERSON>Mark Eberly</PERSON>, a ramp supervisor at the airport, said he dropped
to his knees in shock as he watched the plane land with one of its
engines smoking and the section of fuselage missing. ``I saw hair
flying in the wind and arms dangling,'' he said.
   <PERSON>Craig Nichols</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Pocatello</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION>, said after the plane came to
a stop on the ground, he saw ``some really mangled people,''
including one with an arm almost severed.
   ``It looked like a normal landing with the whole top of the
plane gone,'' he said.
   ``It looked like a convertible,'' said <PERSON>Joe Ronderos</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Los
Angeles</LOCATION>.
   ``It was like somebody had peeled off a layer of skin. You could
just see all the passengers sitting there,'' said <PERSON>George Harvey</PERSON>,
area coordinator for the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Aviation Administration</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Honolulu</LOCATION>.
   Officials at <ORGANIZATION>Boeing Commercial Airplanes</ORGANIZATION>, the primary subsidiary
of <ORGANIZATION>Boeing Co.</ORGANIZATION>, said there were no fuel lines or other potential
sources for an explosion in that part of the plane.
   ``The fuel is in the wing, the engines are in the wing and the
fuel lines are all right there,'' <ORGANIZATION>Boeing</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>Tom Cole</PERSON> said in
<LOCATION>Seattle</LOCATION>.
   ``To have it just explode in the air is just unheard of,'' <PERSON>Cole</PERSON>
said. ``I think this is a very unusual circumstance that is not
related to any other accidents we have had.''
   Even in the extremely unlikely event that a turbine blade tore
loose from an engine and ripped into the fuselage, it could not hit
forward from the wing, and the effect would be nothing like what
happened to the <LOCATION>Aloha</LOCATION> plane, he said.
   The plane was one of nine 737-200s delivered to <LOCATION>Aloha</LOCATION> in the
late <DATE>1970s</DATE>, said <ORGANIZATION>Boeing</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>David Jimenez</PERSON>. The first 737-200
was put into service in <DATE>April 1968</DATE>.
   At a news conference in <LOCATION>Honolulu</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Maurice Myers</PERSON>, president of
<ORGANIZATION>Aloha Airlines</ORGANIZATION>, said nothing is stored in the area of the the blast.
   Myers cited the ``extraordinary performance'' of pilot <PERSON>Robert L.
Schornstheimer</PERSON> in bringing the 737-200 in safely. Schornstheimer
has flown for the airline for 12 years.
   ``I give credit to the pilot. He brought that plane down so
smoothly. It was just like riding in a Cadillac,'' said passenger
<PERSON>John Lopez</PERSON>, 40, of <LOCATION>Hilo</LOCATION>.
   ``I've had worse landings in normal aircraft,'' <PERSON>Dennin</PERSON> said.
   Sixty people were taken to <ORGANIZATION>Maui Memorial Hospital</ORGANIZATION> and 12 were
admitted, two in critical condition and four serious, said <PERSON>Dr.
Charles Mitchell</PERSON>, emergency room director. Injuries included burns,
bruises and cuts, he said.
   The missing flight attendant, identified as <PERSON>Clarabelle B.
Lansing</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Honolulu</LOCATION>, was probably either ejected by the blast or
blown out of the plane by the wind, said <PERSON>Clifford Hue</PERSON>, another <ORGANIZATION>FAA</ORGANIZATION>
area manager.
   ``I think the stewardess (<PERSON>Mrs. Lansing</PERSON>) had just picked up the
microphone to start talking'' when the explosion occurred, <PERSON>Fink</PERSON>
said.
   Fink and <PERSON>Dennin</PERSON> said some of the passengers hung on to another
standing flight attendant so she would not be sucked out of the
plane, and they praised the cabin crew for helping calm the
passengers.
   The <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Coast Guard</ORGANIZATION> mounted a search that included a cutter, a
C-130 search and rescue aircraft and two helicopters, said <ORGANIZATION>Coast
Guard</ORGANIZATION> spokesman Petty Officer <PERSON>Jeffrey Crawley</PERSON>.
   However, searchers found no trace of <PERSON>Mrs. Lansing</PERSON>, a 37-year
employee of the airline, or the missing section of the plane, he
said.
   The explosion occurred southeast of <LOCATION>Maui</LOCATION> while the plane was at
an altitude of 24,000 feet, the airline said. It said the 110-mile
flight from <LOCATION>Hilo</LOCATION> on <LOCATION>Hawaii Island</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Kahului</LOCATION> carried 89 passengers,
five crew members and an air traffic controller from <LOCATION>Hilo Airport</LOCATION>.

   Moderate earthquakes struck in <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION> and in
<LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>, but there were no immediate reports of damage or injuries
in either temblor.
   The <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> quake rattled residents along a 100-mile stretch

said <PERSON>Hall Daily</PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION>California Institute of

<PERSON>William Mass</PERSON>, a geophysist at the <ORGANIZATION>Pacific Tsunami Warning Center</ORGANIZATION> on
the island of <LOCATION>Oahu</LOCATION>.
   It didn't cause a tsunami, or tidal wave, <PERSON>Mass</PERSON> said.
   Police checked the area around the epicenter for signs of
damage, but found none, said Officer <PERSON>Randy Arello</PERSON>.
   ``It was strong enough to feel, but not that bad,'' <PERSON>Arello</PERSON> said.
   Quakes ranging in magnitude from 4 to 5 on the Richter scale of
ground motion are considered moderate, and can cause some local
damage, mostly broken houseware, items falling from shelves, broken
windows and cracks in poorly built structures.

   The strongest earthquake to hit <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION> in
six years shook a sparsely populated area of <LOCATION>Hawaii Island</LOCATION> already
ravaged by lava, destroying two homes and generating a small tidal
wave.
   No serious injuries were reported.
   Authorities were investigating reports of damage to other homes
<DATE>Monday</DATE>, said <ORGANIZATION>Hawaii County Civil Defense</ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON>Harry Kim</PERSON>.
   ``Our first priority this morning is to check certain remote
areas to make sure no one is trapped in their homes,'' <PERSON>Kim</PERSON> said.
``Early reports we are getting indicate no one is trapped.''
   The temblor, caused by the 6{-year-old eruption of <LOCATION>Kilauea
Volcano</LOCATION>, struck <DATE>Sunday</DATE> <TIME>evening</TIME> and measured 6.1 on the Richter
scale, the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Geological Survey</ORGANIZATION> said.
   It was centered west of <LOCATION>Kalapana</LOCATION>, a small coastal town on the
south flank of the volcano, said <PERSON>Bruce Turner</PERSON>, a geophysicist at the
<ORGANIZATION>Pacific Tsunami Warning Center</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Honolulu</LOCATION>.
   The quake was triggered by the release of pressure generated by
the movement of underground magma, or molten rock, said <PERSON>Bob
Koyanagi</PERSON>, a seismic analyst at the <ORGANIZATION>Geological Survey</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Hawaiian
Volcano Observatory</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>Reggie Okamura</PERSON>, a spokesman for the observatory, said scientists
had recorded numerous aftershocks. The strongest, measuring 4.0 on
the Richter scale, was recorded <DATE>Sunday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>, he said.
   <LOCATION>Kilauea</LOCATION> lava has destroyed 68 homes in the <LOCATION>Kalapana</LOCATION> area since
its latest eruption began <DATE>Jan. 3, 1983</DATE>. Four homes were destroyed in
<DATE>May</DATE>, and <DATE>last Thursday</DATE> a <ORGANIZATION>Hawaii Volcanoes National Park</ORGANIZATION> visitor
center burst into flames as lava crept beneath the wooden structure.
   <PERSON>Koyanagi</PERSON> said pressure became too great within the world's most
active volcano, causing its south flank to move and triggering the
earthquake.
   The tidal wave, which measured 22.8 inches high at <LOCATION>Honuapo</LOCATION>, 8.4
inches at Kapoho and 5.6 inches at <LOCATION>Hilo</LOCATION>, caused no damage, <PERSON>Turner</PERSON>
said.
   Five people were injured by falling debris inside homes, but none
required hospitalization, <PERSON>Kim</PERSON> said. Crews were working to repair
downed power lines.
   It was the strongest earthquake to hit the state since <DATE>Nov. 15,
1983</DATE>, when a 6.6 temblor caused <MONEY>several million dollars</MONEY> damage on
<LOCATION>Hawaii Island</LOCATION>.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude.

<TEXT>
<P>
Kaolelo Ulaleo remembers trekking with his grandmother into the rain forest, an 
enchanting place where feathery ferns grew tall enough to dwarf a small boy. 
</P>
<P>
She taught him to pull roots from the moist earth to make tea and pick berries 
for traditional home remedies. 
</P>
<P>
"For me, <PERSON>Wao Kele</PERSON> is the spoon that feeds you," said <PERSON>41-year-old Ulaleo</PERSON>, who 
has continued to visit the forest throughout his adult life. "You come inside, 
and everywhere is God." 
</P>
<P>
Today, other visitors have come to the forest that Ulaleo treasures, known as 
<LOCATION>Wao Kele o Puna</LOCATION>, or <ORGANIZATION>Rain Belt of Puna</ORGANIZATION>, on the island of <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>. Their mark is 
less subtle. 
</P>
<P>
The bulldozers of <ORGANIZATION>True Geothermal Energy Co.</ORGANIZATION> have cleared several acres of 
trees and tangled undergrowth in hopes of tapping volcanic steam for a 
25-megawatt power plant. In the process, the industrial newcomers have taken 
center stage in the struggle over the future of the last major tract of lowland 
tropical rain forest in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents in <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION> and on the mainland argue that geothermal development could 
destroy a unique and fragile ecosystem by slicing through it with a web of 
pipes, generators and transmission lines. <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>'s forests are especially 
prized because most of their plants and animals are found nowhere else in the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
"The greatest danger to any tropical forest is fragmentation," said <PERSON>Dan Taylor</PERSON>, 
chief of resources management at nearby <ORGANIZATION>Hawaii Volcanoes National Park</ORGANIZATION>. "It can 
only go so far before the whole system collapses." 
</P>
<P>
Formal challenges have quietly and laboriously made their way through the 
courts and government hearing rooms for years. Ironically, geothermal energy is 
usually considered an environmentally benign alternative, and partly for that 
reason, the early local skirmishes attracted little notice beyond <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>'s 
shores. But the issue of the rain forest changed all that. 
</P>
<P>
"How can we expect to save the rain forests in <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION> if we can't 
save our own?" asked <PERSON>Suzanne Head</PERSON> of the San Francisco-based <ORGANIZATION>Rainforest Action 
Network</ORGANIZATION>, which has seized on the case as a test for the environmental movement. 
</P>
<P>
As drilling begins in the forest, the struggle has moved into the streets. 
</P>
<P>
Five people were arrested in late <DATE>October</DATE> for trying to block trucks hauling 
equipment to the site, 3 miles deep into the rain forest. Two weeks ago, 
protesters staged sit-ins at the offices of Gov. <PERSON>John Waihee</PERSON> and held all-night 
vigils outside to dramatize their call for a moratorium on geothermal 
development. 
</P>
<P>
Wao <ORGANIZATION>Kele o Puna</ORGANIZATION> is just part of a sprawling geothermal resource zone designated 
by the state on the eastern slope of <LOCATION>Kilauea Volcano</LOCATION>. An ambitious plan 
designed to promote <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>'s energy independence calls for geothermal plants to 
produce up to 500 megawatts of power, much of it to be carried through undersea 
pipes to <LOCATION>Honolulu</LOCATION> and elsewhere in this island chain. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years the plan has provoked opposition from various quarters, with the 
arguments ranging from the spiritual to the practical. 
</P>
<P>
Some native Hawaiians consider geothermal drilling a violation of the volcano 
goddess, <ORGANIZATION>Pele</ORGANIZATION>, and have appealed all the way to the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION>, without 
success. Now they are challenging the legality of the state's transfer of 
27,000 acres of forest land, including <LOCATION>Wao Kele o Puna</LOCATION>, to a private estate for 
development. The case is on appeal to the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals</ORGANIZATION> in 
<LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby residents, soured by noise and noxious fumes from a small, experimental 
plant outside the forest, have argued against geothermal development on health 
and safety grounds. They also question the wisdom of drilling near an active 
volcano. 
</P>
<P>
But the issue that has grabbed the most attention in this environmentally 
conscious age is the threat to the rain forest. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not just a native Hawaiian struggle any more," said <PERSON>Palikapu Dedman</PERSON>, 
president of the <ORGANIZATION>Pele Defense Fund</ORGANIZATION>, which has led the legal fight. "It's 
everybody's struggle now." 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>'s once extensive lowland forests have been all but consumed since the 
first Polynesian voyagers arrived. The Puna forest's inaccessibility and 
proximity to the volcano have helped protect it, until now. Naturalists argue 
that a geothermal network in the area would hasten the invasion of aggressive, 
non-native species that have decimated other areas. They also fear the effects 
of noise, lights and emissions on wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
Tropical rain forests have moved to the forefront of environmental concerns in 
the past few years as fears over global warming have heightened. The forests 
are considered crucibles of life itself because they help regulate the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s 
climate and house nearly half of all plant and animal species. But these rich 
habitats are fast disappearing as developing countries clear vast areas for 
timber or agriculture. An estimated 50 million acres a year is destroyed 
worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists blame global warming on such deforestation and the burning of wood 
and fossil fuels. Leaders of industrialized nations, including President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>, 
have called on their Third World counterparts to stop the plunder of the rain 
forests. Although <ORGANIZATION>Wao Kele o Puna</ORGANIZATION> is tiny by comparison to other tropical 
forests, environmentalists consider it strategically important to their 
crusade. 
</P>
<P>
The 25,000-member <ORGANIZATION>Rainforest Action Network</ORGANIZATION> has begun distributing leaflets to 
Hawaii-bound travelers at <LOCATION>West Coast</LOCATION> airports, with fluorescent green stickers 
that read "Save <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>'s rain forests. Stop the <LOCATION>Big Island</LOCATION> power plant, or I 
stop traveling." It also plans a demonstration <DATE>Dec. 14</DATE> at <ORGANIZATION>True Geothermal</ORGANIZATION>'s 
Casper, <LOCATION>Wyo.</LOCATION>, headquarters and simultaneous protests in <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>. 
And it is calling for a boycott of Hawaii-made products. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people have emotional attachments to <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION> because it's unique and 
beautiful," Head said. "Given the visibility of the rain forest issue and the 
fact that this one is in our country, I think there is a pretty good chance of 
actually stopping the project." 
</P>
<P>
But geothermal energy has strong allies in <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>. Along with the electric 
utility, the state government promotes geothermal power as a cheap, clean and 
indigenous source of energy. 
</P>
<P>
"Of all the options, geothermal continues to be the most attractive," said 
<PERSON>Maurice Kaya</PERSON> of the state's energy program office. "The power is available 24 
hours a day, and the money doesn't leave the state." 
</P>
<P>
Hawaii depends on oil, most of it foreign, for <PERCENT>90%</PERCENT> of its energy needs. While 
the islands have abundant wind and sunshine, those energy sources are 
intermittent and expensive compared to geothermal, <PERSON>Kaya</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Allan Kawada</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION> representative for <ORGANIZATION>True Geothermal</ORGANIZATION>, said the company chose 
to drill here because of the state's commitment to geothermal energy. The 
developer, he noted, has already endured an exhaustive permit process and plans 
to use just 350 acres of the forest. 
</P>
<P>
"We've gone through about seven years of regulatory approvals," he said. "These 
issues have all been discussed at length many times, not just once. We feel we 
have the right to go forward." 
</P>
<P>
Geothermal development was originally slated for another forest, known as 
<LOCATION>Kahaualea</LOCATION>, further upland on the volcano's rift zone. But naturalists -- and 
nature itself -- intervened. While the proposed drilling was being contested as 
a threat to a pristine native ecosystem, <LOCATION>Kilauea Volcano</LOCATION> began to erupt in <DATE>1983</DATE> 
and eventually buried much of the area in fresh lava. Some native Hawaiians 
suggest that Pele was making her feelings known about geothermal development. 
</P>
<P>
In <DATE>1985</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>state Board of Land and Natural Resources</ORGANIZATION> agreed to exchange the 
private estate lands at Kahaualea for the state-owned Wao Kele o Puna to allow 
geothermal development in the lowland forest. Environmentalists supported the 
trade because, like most highland areas, <PERSON>Kahaualea</PERSON>'s ecosystem was more intact 
than <LOCATION>Wao Kele o Puna</LOCATION>. But that hasn't stopped them from trying to save <LOCATION>Wao Kele</LOCATION> 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
"Those same people were who were saying 'Go down to the <ORGANIZATION>Natural Area Reserve</ORGANIZATION>' 
are now saying that we should preserve it," complained <PERSON>Kawada</PERSON>, shaking his 
head. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Charles Lamoureux</PERSON>, a professor of botany at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Hawaii</ORGANIZATION> and a 
consultant to the developer, contends that the threat to the <LOCATION>Wao Kele</LOCATION> has been 
exaggerated. The forest is not pristine, and drilling sites were chosen to 
minimize the impact on native ecosystems, he said. He also discounts the threat 
of emissions, noting that 
</P>
<P>
wildlife here has evolved around volcanic activity. 
</P>
<P>
"There are patches of good forest and there are patches that aren't," <PERSON>Lamoureux</PERSON> 
said. "The best lowland forest is outside of the geothermal zone. . . . We're 
talking about meddling with an area that has already been trashed by strawberry 
guava, mynah birds and wild pigs (non-native species). I'm not convinced this 
project will have any measurable effect." 
</P>
<P>
But other natural scientists disagree. While foreign plants have infested parts 
of the Puna forest, much of it is considered a rare collection of varied 
ecosystems that have sprung up after successive lava flows over the centuries. 
The forest also boasts large populations of native birds, which elsewhere have 
fled to higher elevations. 
</P>
<P>
"You have a mosaic of different aged forests, from 600 years to the present," 
said <PERSON>Jim Jacobi</PERSON>, a botanist with the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service</ORGANIZATION>, who has 
mapped native vegetation throughout <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>. "It's a really dynamic set of 
ecosystems that doesn't exist anywhere else in <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"We've lost so many areas in <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>," he added. "What little we have left is 
priceless." 
</P>
<P>
Because of its distance from any major land mass, <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION> is considered a 
storehouse of revolutionary wonders. Only a few seeds, birds and insects were 
hardy enough to make their way here after the first volcanic cones burst 
through the ocean's surface millions of years ago. From those few early 
arrivals, a plethora of native species have evolved. 
</P>
<P>
"These are the most isolated islands on the face of the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>," noted <PERSON>Taylor</PERSON>. 
"More than <PERCENT>90%</PERCENT> of <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>'s biota are endemic, which means they are found only 
here, a far higher rate than anywhere else. So they're of tremendous interest. 
</P>
<P>
"We have many lessons to learn," he said. "But we're tossing the books out 
before we've read them."
