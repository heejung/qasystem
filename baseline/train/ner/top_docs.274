FT  28 MAY 94 / Scrabble takeover bid on the board
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION>, the biggest US toy and games group, yesterday made a surprise move
to become the world's undisputed Scrabble champion. It launched a Pounds
46.9m unsolicited bid for <ORGANIZATION>JW Spear</ORGANIZATION>, the British company which owns rights to
the board game outside <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION>.
Scrabble, which ranks alongside Monopoly as a board game known throughout
the world, is produced in more than 20 languages and accounts for about 30
per cent of <ORGANIZATION>Spear</ORGANIZATION>'s Pounds 38.7m turnover. This year the company is planning
to introduce versions in Turkish and Hungarian.
Hasbro had sales of Dollars 2.7bn (Pounds 1.8bn) in <DATE>1993</DATE>. It has owned
Scrabble in <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>, where the game was invented more than 50
years ago, since <DATE>1989</DATE>.
It has been the UK company's biggest shareholder outside the Spear family
interests for the past four years, with 26.7 per cent. The trustees of some
Spear family trusts have given undertakings to accept the <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION> bid in
respect of a further 24.9 per cent. The undertakings become irrevocable next
<DATE>Friday</DATE> if a higher offer is not received.
<ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION> is offering 900p a share, a premium of more than 21 per cent to the
last reported dealing price of 740p on <DATE>May 12</DATE>.
The Spear board will meet this morning to consider the bid. The company,
which in <DATE>March</DATE> raised its final dividend by 36 per cent on the back of a <MONEY>22
per cent</MONEY> rise in profits to Pounds 4.51m, is expected to find the offer
inadequate.
<PERSON>Mr Francis Spear</PERSON>, chairman, would make no comment <TIME>last night</TIME>, although he
dismissed any idea of a family row. <PERSON>Mr Paul Lipscomb</PERSON>, finance director, said
the bid had come like a bolt from the blue.
Spear's other products include Atmosfear, a board game linked to a video,
and more traditional pastimes such as Snakes and Ladders.
<PERSON>Mr Alan Hassenfeld</PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION>, said the acquisition would be 'a
logical extension of <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION>'s strategy to develop and expand its core
operations around the world'.
The origins of <ORGANIZATION>Scrabble</ORGANIZATION> lie in the <DATE>1930s</DATE> when it was developed as a
crossword game by <PERSON>Alfred Butts</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> architect whose practice was in
trouble after the Wall Street crash.
It was launched as <ORGANIZATION>Scrabble</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1949</DATE> after almost two decades of rejection by
leading games players as too highbrow. The game took off in the <DATE>1950s</DATE> after
the chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Macy</ORGANIZATION>'s department store in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> became hooked and placed
a large order.
<PERSON>Mr Butts</PERSON>, a poor speller, earned only a <MONEY>5 cent</MONEY> royalty on each set.
Nevertheless, at the peak sales levels in the late <DATE>1950s</DATE> and <DATE>1960s</DATE>, he was
getting about Dollars 50,000 a year.

FT  30 MAY 94 / UK Company News: JW Spear board split over Pounds 47m bid
from Hasbro
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The board of <ORGANIZATION>JW Spear</ORGANIZATION>, which owns the rights to the board game Scrabble
outside <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION>, has been split by the unsolicited offer for the UK
company made by <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION>, the biggest US toys and games group.
At a board meeting on <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, all but one of the Spear directors rejected
the Pounds 46.9m cash offer, which was launched late on <DATE>Friday</DATE>.
The exception was <PERSON>Mr Francis Spear</PERSON>, the group's chairman, who said he
thought the terms - worth 900p per share - were fair and reasonable.
In its offer, <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION> said it intended to encourage <PERSON>Mr Spear</PERSON> to continue to
manage <ORGANIZATION>Spear</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>Enfield</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, manufacturing plant.
The rest of the Spear board, and the company's financial adviser, <LOCATION>Barings</LOCATION>,
said <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION>'s offer was totally inadequate. The board instructed <LOCATION>Barings</LOCATION> to
solicit higher offers.
<ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION> is in a strong position, since it already owns a 26.7 per cent stake
in <ORGANIZATION>Spear</ORGANIZATION> and has received undertakings to accept its offer from some Spear
family trusts which control a further 24.9 per cent.
The undertakings become irrevocable on <DATE>Friday</DATE> if a higher offer has not
received.
Barings is approaching other international toy companies which might be
interested in Spear, but the tight timetable makes it doubtful that another
buyer would have time to intervene. It seems most likely that the rest of
the board will try to obtain a higher offer from <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION>, in exchange for
their recommendation.
Spear is also probably of the greatest value to <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION>, which since <DATE>1989</DATE> has
owned Scrabble in <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>, where the game was invented.
<ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION> said the acquisition would be a logical extension of its strategy to
develop and expand core operations around the world.
It also seems unlikely that Spear could see off <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION> by just selling the
Scrabble business to the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> group.
Scrabble accounts for 40 per cent of the <ORGANIZATION>UK</ORGANIZATION> group's sales and one source
said 'the rest of the games portfolio hangs on the back of it.'
<ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION>'s offer of 900p a share is a premium of more than 21 per cent to the
last reported dealing price of 740p on <DATE>May 12</DATE>.

FT  04 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Mattel bids Pounds 52m for Spear - The
scrap over Scrabble gathers pace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The battle between <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s two leading toy makers moved to the Scrabble
board yesterday after <ORGANIZATION>Mattel</ORGANIZATION> trumped <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION>'s bid for <ORGANIZATION>JW Spear</ORGANIZATION>, the word
game's UK maker.
In the corporate finance equivalent of getting all seven letters out on a
triple word score, <ORGANIZATION>Spear</ORGANIZATION>'s advisers solicited a Pounds 52m bid from <ORGANIZATION>Mattel</ORGANIZATION>
which was launched just five minutes before <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>'s deadline.
The offer of Pounds 10 a share beats the 900p bid from <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION> and was
immediately welcomed by <ORGANIZATION>Spear</ORGANIZATION>'s board. However, Action Man maker <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION>,
which has the rights to Scrabble in <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION>, is widely expected to
return with a higher offer.
'There must be a pretty good chance,' admitted a member of the <ORGANIZATION>Mattel</ORGANIZATION> team.
The scrap over <LOCATION>Scrabble</LOCATION> continues a rivalry which spilled over into the law
courts 18 months ago when <ORGANIZATION>Mattel</ORGANIZATION> claimed <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION>'s Sindy doll looked too
similar to its own <ORGANIZATION>Barbie</ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION>Mattel</ORGANIZATION> dropped its lawsuit after <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION> agreed to
give Sindy a facelift.
<ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION>, which has held a 26.7 per cent stake in Spear since <DATE>1990</DATE>, launched
its bid after it received undertakings to accept the offer from <PERSON>Spear</PERSON> family
trusts which control a further 24.9 per cent. The undertakings were to
become irrevocable if a higher offer was not received by <TIME>midnight</TIME> on
<DATE>Thursday</DATE>. The trusts have little option but to accept the highest bid.
The original bid split <ORGANIZATION>Spear</ORGANIZATION>'s boardroom with <PERSON>Mr Francis Spear</PERSON>, chairman,
saying it was 'fair and reasonable' and the other directors dismissing it as
'totally inadequate'.
Although welcoming the new offer <PERSON>Mr Spear</PERSON> has yet to join the other
directors in advising shareholders that the <ORGANIZATION>Mattel</ORGANIZATION> offer 'represents a
better prospect for the future development of the business of Spear'.
<PERSON>Mr Spear</PERSON> is close to the <PERSON>Hassenfeld</PERSON> family which founded <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION> but the rest
of the management are understood to be worried that Spear would disappear
within <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION>'s international games business.
In contrast, <ORGANIZATION>Spear</ORGANIZATION> would be the first sizeable move into board games for
<ORGANIZATION>Mattel</ORGANIZATION>, which has previously expressed interest in the area. This made it a
natural target for <ORGANIZATION>Barings</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Spear</ORGANIZATION>'s advisers, when searching for a rival
bidder. <ORGANIZATION>Mattel</ORGANIZATION> finally responded at 5pm and <PERSON>Robert Fleming</PERSON>, its swiftly
appointed merchant bank, launched the bid six hours later.
The last recorded trade in Spear shares was at 740p on <DATE>May 12</DATE>. <ORGANIZATION>Mattel</ORGANIZATION>'s
offer represents 18.4 times <ORGANIZATION>Spear</ORGANIZATION>'s earnings last year.

FT  01 DEC 94 / Waddington passes Monopoly to Hasbro and collects Pounds 50m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hasbro yesterday bought <PERSON>Waddington</PERSON>'s games division for Pounds 50m in cash,
giving the biggest US toy and games group a monopoly on Monopoly, the
world's best-selling board game.
Mention Monopoly in the <ORGANIZATION>UK</ORGANIZATION>, and people immediately think of <PERSON>Waddington</PERSON>. But
the archetypal game of capitalists, once banned in the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> as
ideologically unsound, was invented in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> in the <DATE>1930s</DATE>.
Waddington has always been a printing company, diversifying into games in
the <DATE>1920s</DATE> by printing playing cards. The grandfather of <PERSON>Mr Victor Watson</PERSON>,
who retired as chairman <DATE>last year</DATE>, obtained the Monopoly licence for the
<ORGANIZATION>British Empire</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1935</DATE>. The licence was granted by <ORGANIZATION>Parker Brothers</ORGANIZATION> of the
<LOCATION>US</LOCATION>, now part of the <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION> empire. Hasbro itself had a licence to market
<ORGANIZATION>Cluedo</ORGANIZATION>, owned by <PERSON>Waddington</PERSON>, outside the <ORGANIZATION>UK</ORGANIZATION>.
<PERSON>Mr Michael Buckley</PERSON>, chief executive of <LOCATION>Waddington</LOCATION>, said that the sale of the
games division was viewed with some regret, but it was matched by pleasure
at how the group could use the cash. 'The games division is a super company,
but we did not think we could make it any bigger or better.'
The deal will leave <PERSON>Waddington</PERSON> cash positive to the tune of Pounds 13m. It
plans to invest further in both the printing and packaging divisions.
<ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION> was pipped to the post this <DATE>summer</DATE> in a battle for Scrabble with
<ORGANIZATION>Mattel</ORGANIZATION>, its main rival in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> market. <ORGANIZATION>Mattel</ORGANIZATION> paid Pounds 62m for JW
Spear, the UK company with the rights to Scrabble outside <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION>, which owns the <ORGANIZATION>North American Scrabble</ORGANIZATION> rights, said it felt the
winning price for Spear, at about 21 times earnings, was too high. However,
it is paying about 21 times earnings for the <ORGANIZATION>Waddington</ORGANIZATION> division, which made
operating profits of Pounds 3.5m on sales of Pounds 25.9m in the year to
<DATE>April</DATE>, because of the quality of the portfolio.
<PERSON>Mr Brian Ellis</PERSON>, of <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro UK</ORGANIZATION>, said the <PERSON>Waddington</PERSON> catalogue had 850 items,
only about 60 of which were games. Monopoly, which sold 300,000 sets in the
UK <DATE>last year</DATE>, represented only 15 per cent of the turnover.
'It is much more of a general toy company than a games company,' he said,
citing in particular the Get Set craft products, which are expecting 35 per
cent growth this year.

SCRABBLE FANS FIND GAME A MARRIAGE OF CHALLENGE, DISCIPLINE, MENTAL STIMULATION

<P>
Under rows of harsh fluorescent lights, they sit at folding tables, hunched 
over boards covered with small, square tiles. 
</P>
<P>
The room is silent as 10 pairs of players sweat it out in a battle of wits, 
probing their minds for obscure words and letter combinations. 
</P>
<P>
They're playing Scrabble, but this is not exactly the game that many people 
remember playing with their grandmothers over pound cake and iced tea on <DATE>Sunday</DATE> 
afternoons. 
</P>
<P>
These are hard-core Scrabble players, many of whom also play chess, who enjoy 
the game for its challenge, discipline and mental stimulation. 
</P>
<P>
And they take their games seriously, memorizing hundreds of obscure words and 
mastering strategies and lingo. 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>Eagle Rock Scrabble Club</ORGANIZATION> was started in <DATE>July</DATE> by <PERSON>George Heussenstamm</PERSON>, a 
classical composer who teaches music composition and theory at <LOCATION>Cal State Los 
Angeles</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Cal State Northridge</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
300 <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Clubs 
</P>
<P>
The club, one of more than 300 in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, meets from 7 to <TIME>10 p.m.</TIME> 
the second and <DATE>fourth Wednesday</DATE> of the month in the <ORGANIZATION>Yosemite Senior Center</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Members pay <MONEY>$1</MONEY> for admission, which covers <ORGANIZATION>Heussenstamm</ORGANIZATION>'s mailings and the 
cookies and coffee provided at the meetings. 
</P>
<P>
When Heussenstamm, a veteran Scrabble aficionado, started the club, there were 
only a handful of players. 
</P>
<P>
Now the group averages 17, and he expects it to grow, following a national 
trend of increasing interest in the game, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's something of an obsession," <PERSON>Heussenstamm</PERSON> said. "It's the kind of thing 
that once you start, it's hard to stop." 
</P>
<P>
The club is an eclectic mix of people. At one table, a thin, dark man is 
listening through earphones to a portable tape player, moving his head slightly 
as his eyes flicker back and forth across his tiles. 
</P>
<P>
His opponent is an unemployed <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> veteran who is also an avid chess player. 
</P>
<P>
At another table, a 22-year-old physics major from <ORGANIZATION>Occidental College</ORGANIZATION> is 
battling a heavyset woman who is an administrator with the <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> school 
district. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Highly Organized 
</P>
<P>
Scrabble clubs are highly organized and strictly follow a set of <ORGANIZATION>Scrabble</ORGANIZATION> rules 
promulgated by <ORGANIZATION>Scrabble Crossword Game Players Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a national organization. 
</P>
<P>
Games are timed using chess clocks, and each player is allowed three minutes 
per move. And the players are serious about their games and strategies. 
</P>
<P>
Like chess, <ORGANIZATION>Scrabble</ORGANIZATION> entails strategic planning. 
</P>
<P>
Players learn rack management, a method of keeping a balance of vowels and 
consonants. Good players also have to know when to pass their turn, and how to 
work toward bingos -- a move in which all seven letters are used in one turn. 
But the most important strategy is building vocabulary. 
</P>
<P>
True Scrabble aficionados fervently study their <ORGANIZATION>Official Scrabble Players 
Dictionary</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
They pore over lists of words, memorizing thousands of two- and three-letter 
words and their possible prefixes and suffixes to help them in their 
strategies. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the word lists are so obscure that they almost look like random pages 
from a beginning Latin handbook. 
</P>
<P>
Scrabble players learn such oddities as "os," meaning orifice; "ta," an 
expression of gratitude, and "ho," an exclamation of surprise. 
</P>
<P>
"The key is in knowing your words," <PERSON>Heussenstamm</PERSON> said. "You have to build a big 
vocabulary if you want to be good at this game. It involves more than just 
slapping letters on a board." 
</P>
<P>
Someone bellows "challenge" from the far corner of the room, and <PERSON>Heussenstamm</PERSON> 
scurries away to settle the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
Heussenstamm started the club in <ORGANIZATION>Eagle Rock</ORGANIZATION> because he wanted to be able to 
play in a group close to his La Crescenta home. 
</P>
<P>
But as director, he has duties to fulfill. 
</P>
<P>
If an even number of players show up, Heussenstamm doesn't play, and he must 
act as referee in the case of disputed words. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been somewhat sacrificial for me," <PERSON>Heussenstamm</PERSON> said. "I don't get to 
play much any more."

COMPUTAINMENT: DELUXE SCRABBLE SCORES WITH NONTRADITIONALISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
<PERSON>Virgin Mastertronics</PERSON>' "The Deluxe Computer Edition of Scrabble" trades away 
much of the familiar appeal of the classic board game for some intriguing bells 
and whistles. Serious players looking to exercise their skills and stretch 
their vocabularies probably will embrace the new features. 
</P>
<P>
But traditionalists will long for the competition, surprise and camaraderie 
possible only between human players. 
</P>
<P>
In its most basic form, this computer version of Scrabble -- actually a totally 
redesigned update of an earlier electronic version of the game -- closely 
resembles the actual board game. After fellow players -- human or computer -- 
and difficultly levels are chosen, random letters are assigned to each player. 
</P>
<P>
Words are formed and placed on the board in the same way you would with actual 
tiles. A very welcome calculating feature keeps track of the point values for 
all levels of scoring. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, however, the computer version doesn't do a very good job of 
hiding tiles. Whether playing the computer or another human, it is all but 
impossible not to know what your opponent has in his/her/its rack. Using the 
hide feature doesn't help much either. 
</P>
<P>
We also found a lot to be desired with the huge (2.5 megabytes) dictionary 
program that comes with the game: golfer and offer for two. The game makers 
promised the entire "Official Scrabble Player's Dictionary," but our trusty 
<DATE>1979</DATE> paperback edition turned out to be a bit more complete than the <DATE>1990</DATE> 
electronic one. 
</P>
<P>
"Deluxe Computer Scrabble" has enough pluses to make it as a good solitaire 
game, but it is definitely not a substitute for an evening with the original 
board game and a couple of good friends.

FT  09 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Hasbro raises offer for JW Spear by Pounds
2 a share
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION>, the largest US toy and games group, yesterday raised its bid for <ORGANIZATION>JW
Spear</ORGANIZATION>, the UK company which owns the rights to the Scrabble board game
outside <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION>.
The <ORGANIZATION>US</ORGANIZATION> group, which already owns the North American rights for Scrabble as
well as 26.7 per cent of <ORGANIZATION>Spear</ORGANIZATION>, increased its offer to Pounds 11 a share,
valuing Spear at Pounds 57.3m. It is also offering a loan note alternative.
The new terms are 100p above an offer from <ORGANIZATION>Mattel</ORGANIZATION>, the rival US toy company,
and 200p ahead of its original offer, made at the end of <DATE>May</DATE>.
<PERSON>Mr Norman Walker</PERSON>, a director of <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro UK</ORGANIZATION>, said the increased offer
represented 'significant enhanced value for shareholders' and reflected
<ORGANIZATION>Spear</ORGANIZATION>'s past performance and future prospects.
<PERSON>Mr Paul Lipscombe</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Spear</ORGANIZATION>'s finance director, said the board would meet next
week 'to consider all aspects of the situation'. The latest offer closes on
<DATE>August 5</DATE>. <ORGANIZATION>Mattel</ORGANIZATION>, whose offer closes on <DATE>Monday</DATE>, said it had noted the new
bid and was considering its options.
Hasbro received no acceptances for its original offer, which was launched
after trustees of some Spear family trusts had given undertakings to sell
their 24.9 per cent stake unless a higher offer was received in three
working days.
The Spear board sought a white knight and found <ORGANIZATION>Mattel</ORGANIZATION>, which launched its
bid at five minutes to <TIME>midnight</TIME> on the <DATE>last day</DATE>.
Hasbro went to the <ORGANIZATION>High Court</ORGANIZATION>, claiming that <ORGANIZATION>Mattel</ORGANIZATION>'s late offer had not
been properly announced; but the judge released the trustees from any
obligation to sell their shares to <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION>.
The Spear board, which was not recommending either offer, has since allowed
<ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION> to take a more detailed look at the company and its forecasts.
The trustees have given no further undertakings to <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION>. Hasbro argues
that its offer gives the trusts and families that own a large part of Spear
an opportunity to escape from the limited liquidity of the shares.
The last recorded trade in Spear shares was at 740p on <DATE>May 12</DATE>. <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION>'s
latest offer represents 20 times Spear's earnings last year.

raising its bid in the battle for JW Spear, the British company which owns
the rights to the Scrabble board game outside <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION>.
So far <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION>, which owns Scrabble in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>, has received no
acceptances for its 900p a share bid, launched at the end of <DATE>last month</DATE>.
Yesterday it extended its offer, which values Spear at Pounds 46.9m, to <DATE>July
11</DATE>.
<ORGANIZATION>Mattel</ORGANIZATION>, the rival US toy group which made a last minute bid for <ORGANIZATION>Spear</ORGANIZATION>,
yesterday posted its offer document to Spear shareholders, offering Pounds
10 a share in cash or loan notes.
<PERSON>Mr Nigel Hutton</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro UK</ORGANIZATION> said the group was still considering all its
options, and would be looking at both the Spear defence document and the
<ORGANIZATION>Mattel</ORGANIZATION> offer document closely.
The Spear defence document is expected later this week. The board is not
expected to find either offer fair and reasonable, although the higher
<ORGANIZATION>Mattel</ORGANIZATION> bid will be preferred.
<ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION>, which already owns more than 26 per cent of <ORGANIZATION>Spear</ORGANIZATION>, launched its bid
after trustees of some Spear family trusts had given undertakings to sell a
further 24.9 per cent unless a higher offer was received in three working
days.
The <ORGANIZATION>Mattel</ORGANIZATION> bid was launched at five minutes to <TIME>midnight</TIME> on the <DATE>last day</DATE>.
Last week a <ORGANIZATION>High Court</ORGANIZATION> judge released the trustees from any obligation to
sell their shares to <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION>, who had claimed that <ORGANIZATION>Mattel</ORGANIZATION>'s late offer had
not been properly announced.

<LEADPARA>  THE FIRST World Scrabble Championship will be next week in London, with
competitors from 20 countries vying for the $10,000 first prize. It should be
fun to hear or read the news reports about this championship because they are
certain to feature the most obscure, obsolete, and lengthy words played during
the final game.;   Most Scrabble players realize, however, that it is not the
very long words, but the very short words instead that are the keys to victory
in this game. There are 86 two-letter words, for example, that are considered
acceptable for Scrabble play, but many (such as "jo," "li," and "od") are just
as obscure as their sesquipedalian counterparts. (Let's see, that's 1 for the
"s," 2, 3, plus 10 for the "q," plus 1, plus 1, and 3 for the "p" . . . )  </LEADPARA>

Russell's books for parents and children include "Classics to Read Aloud to
Your Children" and "Classic Myths to Read  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     So, if this most-popular word game (<PERCENT>27 percent</PERCENT> of American homes have at
least one Scrabble set) hinges on words that aren't a common part of any
adult's speaking or writing vocabulary, can it possibly be a good teaching or
learning tool for parents to use with their children?;   THE answer is yes,
but not if it is played the way it is in championships or in most competitions
among adults. The game of Scrabble was designed to put a premium on knowledge
and skill during the course of play. There is a measure of luck involved (as
in the drawing of letters, for example), but <ORGANIZATION>Scrabble</ORGANIZATION> is a very scary game to
those who feel less than confident in their own vocabulary or spelling
ability.;   And so when children, even teen-age children, are asked to join a
<ORGANIZATION>Scrabble</ORGANIZATION> game with their parents, they are intimidated by the likelihood that
their comparative ignorance of words and spellings will be exposed during the
play, and they will not only lose, but be embarrassed at the same time.;   One
way to include people of varying abilities in a single game of <ORGANIZATION>Scrabble</ORGANIZATION> is to
give all players a pencil and note pad, so that they can write down various
words and letter combinations before having to display their selection on the
board. This levels the playing field somewhat by reducing the advantage of
those who can "see" various words in their mind without having to write them
out.;   You can also make a dictionary available for players to use during the
game -- not just for challenges. This practice not only encourages and builds
dictionary skills, but it also helps the entire family become more familiar
with the "family dictionary." (This is yet another reason not to select a
bigger-than-a-breadbox version for your home.);   A THIRD technique for
encouraging "family Scrabble" is to play in teams rather than as individuals.
The weakest and strongest players can be paired as a team (on opposite sides
of the table), and their scores combined. In this way, children can
concentrate on contributing some points, even just a few, at each turn, rather
than being solely responsible for their total score at the end of the game.;  
All three techniques can, of course, be employed at the same time, and other
adaptations are possible as well.;   There are many language benefits that can
come from playing Scrabble, including a knowledge of letter frequencies,
common word endings, and letter combinations. But there are even more benefits
that can come from "family Scrabble," if we will just tune ourselves to our
children's abilities and fears, and adapt this game, like all family games, in
ways that will make everyone eager to participate.  </TEXT>

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
JW <ORGANIZATION>Spear &amp; Sons</ORGANIZATION>, maker of Scrabble and other indoor games, is proposing to
lift its full-year dividend by 36 per cent on the back of a substantial
increase in profits for <DATE>1993</DATE>.
The pre-tax figure rose by 22 per cent from Pounds 3.71m to Pounds 4.51m.
Earnings per share increased from 47.3p to 56.55p.
The recommended final dividend of 16p (11.5p) lifts the total pay-out for
the year from 14p to 19p.
Turnover increased by nearly Pounds 6m to Pounds 38.7m. The figure contains
Pounds 4.49m from acquisitions, including a contribution from the games
division of Murfett Regency (<LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>) acquired last <DATE>May</DATE> for Pounds 1.8m
cash. The purchase brought with it the rights to <ORGANIZATION>Scrabble</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>.
Scrabble is made in more than 20 languages and accounts for about 30 per
cent of turnover. This year sees the introduction of versions in Turkish and
Hungarian.
<PERSON>Mr Michael Bucher</PERSON>, managing director, said <DATE>1993</DATE> marked the sixth successive
year of increases in turnover and profits 'in spite of generally poor market
conditions for traditional games in comparison with video and computer
games.'
The company has fought back with the introduction of board games linked to
video cassettes and compact discs. Overall, it has introduced 121 new and
revised items this year.
Last year reduced UK sales were offset by strong growth in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> and the
addition of the Benelux countries and the Australian markets.

<TEXT>
<ORGANIZATION>Mattel</ORGANIZATION> yesterday snatched victory from rival US toy group <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION> in the
battle for JW Spear, the British company which owns the rights to the
Scrabble board game outside <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Mattel</ORGANIZATION>, the maker of Barbie dolls, raised its offer for shares in Spear from
Pounds 10 to Pounds 11.50, valuing the company at Pounds 62m. Last <DATE>Friday</DATE>,
<ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION> increased its offer from Pounds 9 to Pounds 11.
Spear's directors and family trustees have irrevocably pledged 2,695,000
shares, or 51.2 per cent of the company, to <ORGANIZATION>Mattel</ORGANIZATION>. Last night, <PERSON>Mr Francis
Spear</PERSON>, chairman said: 'We at <ORGANIZATION>Spear</ORGANIZATION> are happy with the revised offer. We
believe it reflects a fair and reasonable value for the company.'
<ORGANIZATION>Mattel</ORGANIZATION> entered the battle for Spear as a white knight after <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION> launched
a surprise bid in late <DATE>May</DATE>. It wanted a more secure foothold in the market
for board games.
<ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION> already owns the North American rights for <ORGANIZATION>Scrabble</ORGANIZATION>, as well as a
26.7 per cent stake in Spear. The company said <TIME>last night</TIME> that it was
considering its position and would be making a statement today. However, it
said it considered Pounds 11 a 'a very full offer'. It appears likely that
<ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION> will now sell its stake.
<ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION>'s original offer was made after it received undertakings from the
trustees of some <PERSON>Spear</PERSON> family trusts to sell their 24.9 per cent stake
unless a higher offer was received within three working days.
<ORGANIZATION>Mattel</ORGANIZATION> launched its counter attack at five minutes to <TIME>midnight</TIME> on the <DATE>last
day</DATE>. Hasbro went to the <ORGANIZATION>High Court</ORGANIZATION>, claiming <ORGANIZATION>Mattel</ORGANIZATION>'s offer had not been
properly announced. But the judge released the trustees from any obligation
to sell their shares.
The Spear board, which was split by the original offer, was not recommending
either bidder. Hasbro raised the stakes <DATE>last Friday</DATE> after Spear allowed it
to take a closer look at the company and its forecasts.
The last recorded trade in Spear shares was at 740p on <DATE>May 12</DATE>. <ORGANIZATION>Mattel</ORGANIZATION>'s
offer represents an exit multiple of 21.1 times the company's earnings last
year.
<PERSON>Richard Tomkins</PERSON> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> adds: <PERSON>Mr John Amerman</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Mattel</ORGANIZATION> chairman and chief
executive, said he was 'delighted' at the victory. 'This is an excellent
outcome not only for the shareholders but also for <ORGANIZATION>Spear</ORGANIZATION>'s employees and
customers,' he said.

FT  10 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Judge to rule over Scrabble squabble
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A High Court judge will next <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> be asked to decide on the squabble over
<LOCATION>Scrabble</LOCATION>, the board game which is the main target for two US toy groups
battling for control of <ORGANIZATION>JW Spear</ORGANIZATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION>, the biggest US toy company and maker of Action Man, is proceeding
against trustees controlling 24.9 per cent of the family-run group. It will
argue that the trustees are still bound by agreements to sell the stake, in
spite of an eleventh hour bid by <ORGANIZATION>Mattel</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> rival.
<ORGANIZATION>Mattel</ORGANIZATION>, maker of Barbie dolls, yesterday noted news of the court case 'with
regret.' The group said its offer of Pounds 10 a share - Pounds 1 above the
<ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION> offer - was made at <ORGANIZATION>Spear</ORGANIZATION>'s invitation.
<ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION>, which launched its Pounds 46.9m unsolicited bid on <DATE>May 27</DATE>, has been
the biggest shareholder outside the Spear family for the past four years,
with 26.7 per cent. The trustees had given irrevocable undertakings to
accept unless a better offer was made within three business days.
<ORGANIZATION>Mattel</ORGANIZATION>'s offer, valuing Spear at Pounds 52m, was made at just five minutes
to <TIME>midnight</TIME> on the final day.
The announcement was lodged with the <ORGANIZATION>Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>, while the <ORGANIZATION>Takeover
Panel</ORGANIZATION> and both sets of advisers were informed of the offer.
Hasbro claims that this was not a public announcement, and so the
undertakings remain valid.
<ORGANIZATION>Mattel</ORGANIZATION> has been advised that the announcement of its bid was 'sufficient to
release the trustees from their undertakings to <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION>.' It understood that
the trustees had received identical advice.
If <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION> wins on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, it will be able to declare its offer
unconditional. If it loses it could, under the terms of its original bid,
increase its offer.
The Spear board - apart from <PERSON>Mr Francis Spear</PERSON>, chairman - yesterday
reiterated its description of the <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION> offer as 'wholly inadequate.'

Spear
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hasbro yesterday turned up the heat in its battle for control of <ORGANIZATION>JW Spear</ORGANIZATION>,
the games group, with a veiled threat of legal action against trustees
controlling 24.9 per cent of the family-run group.
The US toy maker said the trustees were still bound by agreements to sell
the stake, in spite of an eleventh hour bid by <ORGANIZATION>Mattel</ORGANIZATION>, the rival toys group.
<ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION> launched its Pounds 9 a share bid for <ORGANIZATION>Spear</ORGANIZATION>, maker of the word game
<ORGANIZATION>Scrabble</ORGANIZATION>, 10 days ago, valuing the group at Pounds 47m. The trustees had
agreed to sell their shares to <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION>, as long as Spear did not publicly
announce an alternative, higher bid in three working days.
On the <DATE>last day</DATE>, at just five minutes to <TIME>midnight</TIME>, <ORGANIZATION>Mattel</ORGANIZATION> jumped in with a
Pounds 10 a share offer valuing Spear at Pounds 52m. The announcement was
lodged with the <ORGANIZATION>Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>, while the <ORGANIZATION>Takeover Panel</ORGANIZATION> and both sets of
advisers were informed of the offer.
Hasbro now claims this was not a public announcement and so the undertakings
are valid. 'All the steps were taken of getting ready to make a public
announcement, but no public announcement was ever made,' said <PERSON>Mr Francis
Jackson</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>J Henry Schroder Wagg</ORGANIZATION>, its advisers and merchant bank.
<ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION> said it was considering its options regarding legal action if the
trustees did not adhere to the undertakings. No response had yet been
received from the trustees.
Spear rejected <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION>'s claim and said it had received professional advice
that the <ORGANIZATION>Mattel</ORGANIZATION> offer had been validly announced. The board, with the
exception of <PERSON>Mr Francis Spear</PERSON>, the chairman, was recommending <ORGANIZATION>Mattel</ORGANIZATION>'s
offer. <PERSON>Mr Spear</PERSON> originally backed <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION>'s offer, but has been silent since
the <ORGANIZATION>Mattel</ORGANIZATION> bid.
The regulatory authorities appear to be divided on the issue raised by
<ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION>. Under <ORGANIZATION>Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> guidelines, a public announcement is made by
notifying the <ORGANIZATION>Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> and at least two national newspapers and two
news wires.
However, <ORGANIZATION>Spear</ORGANIZATION>'s advisers, the merchant bank <PERSON>Barings</PERSON>, are understood to have
consulted the <ORGANIZATION>Takeover Panel</ORGANIZATION> on their interpretation of a public
announcement. While the <ORGANIZATION>Panel</ORGANIZATION> would not comment on the contract signed by
the trustees, it is believed to have defined a public announcement as
notification to itself, the <ORGANIZATION>Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>, the company, <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION> and both
sets of advisers.

<TEXT>
The battle for control of <ORGANIZATION>JW Spear</ORGANIZATION>, the maker of the '<ORGANIZATION>Scrabble</ORGANIZATION>' board game,
was thrown open again yesterday when a High Court judge released the
company's trustees from any obligation to sell their shares to <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION>, the
US toy group.
The judge ruled that <ORGANIZATION>Mattel</ORGANIZATION>, a rival US toy company, had acted properly in
announcing an improved offer five minutes before the deadline for the
operation of a clause allowing the trustees to be released from an
irrevocable undertaking to sell a controlling interest to <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION>.
The court's decision now leaves the Spear trustees - who own 24.9 per cent
of the company - free to accept the <ORGANIZATION>Mattel</ORGANIZATION> bid or any higher one.
<ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION> was <TIME>last night</TIME> considering its options: to mount an appeal against
the ruling, out-bid <ORGANIZATION>Mattel</ORGANIZATION>, or walk away. The company is certain to reach
its decision before <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, after which an undertaking given yesterday by
the trustees not to sell their shares to anyone else will expire.
The dispute arose after the Spear trustees gave irrevocable undertakings on
<DATE>May 27</DATE> to accept a Pounds 46.9m bid from <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION> which, with 26.7 per cent,
has been the largest shareholder outside the <PERSON>Spear</PERSON> family for the past four
years. However, <ORGANIZATION>Mattel</ORGANIZATION> responded with a Pounds 52m bid. This was announced
at five minutes to <TIME>midnight</TIME> on <DATE>June 2</DATE>, the final day when the escape clause
applied to allow the trustees to accept higher bids.
The legal action centred on whether <ORGANIZATION>Mattel</ORGANIZATION> had fulfilled its obligations to
make a public announcement of its offer. <ORGANIZATION>Mattel</ORGANIZATION> had informed the <ORGANIZATION>Stock
Exchange</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Takeover Panel</ORGANIZATION> in the minutes leading up to the final
deadline, but not the national press.
Lawyers for <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION> argued that the offer should also have been announced to
at least two national newspapers and two UK wire services.
Giving judgment, <PERSON>Mr Justice Chadwick</PERSON> said that when the escape clause was
agreed between <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION> and the trustees, it was likely that their intention
was to guarantee the commitment of third-party bidders rather than informing
the investing public.
Spear, its trustees and <ORGANIZATION>Mattel</ORGANIZATION> welcomed yesterday's outcome.

   The first-ever World Scrabble Championship begins tomorrow
in London, and leading the U.S. delegation will be a
35-year-old who won a tense victory at the biggest U.S.
tournament in Cincinnati last month. He happens to be my
older brother, Charles.
   Chuck has come a long way. He had seemed normal as a
toddler -- at least to our parents -- but our father got an
inkling of what was in store when he asked five-year-old
Chuck how he did on a test. Laconic even then, Chuck replied:
"Let's see. Four columns. Sixteen rows. Sixty-four questions.
Missed one. Got 63 out of 64 right." By first grade, he was
helping our babysitter with her algebra. By third grade, he
was doing our father's budgets for his part of Westinghouse's
public-relations operation.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In high school outside <LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION> and in college at
<LOCATION>Carnegie Mellon</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Chuck</PERSON> earned full credentials as a math nerd
and computer weenie, but the game of bridge had become his
passion. He, a partner and two innocent bystanders once drove
two hours to a dog track, and the two partners discussed a
single bridge hand the entire trip. After betting for four
hours, <PERSON>Chuck</PERSON> and his partner resumed in mid-sentence and
discussed the same hand the whole way back. Chuck became a
Life Master, bridge's highest rank, at age 20 and finished
second in a national event. Then, in his mid-20s, he became
bored and dropped the game cold.
   Rubik's Cube fascinated him briefly. During a lull as he
and I toured <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> some 10 years ago, I noticed he was
scribbling strings of numbers and letters on a scrap of
paper. I finally figured out that he was trying to
mathematically work through the cube's permutations.
   Chuck soon moved on to gambling, quitting his job as a
computer programmer to move to <LOCATION>Las Vegas</LOCATION> for four months. He
made money counting cards at blackjack and lightening the
wallets of the drunk tourists at the poker table. But he lost
much of the money by experimenting with systems for betting
on sports.
   The interest in gambling ended abruptly, too, and <PERSON>Chuck</PERSON>,
by now a manager for a computer company in <LOCATION>Minneapolis</LOCATION>, took
up Scrabble. His assault on the game began with some
simple-enough pointers: 1) Learn the 86 two-letter words
because they let you connect to existing words; 2) Pay more
attention to what's on the board than what tiles are in your
rack; 3) Worry about what tiles you're stuck with after you
play a word. But most of his approach falls into the
don't-try-this-at-home-kids-because-this-is-for-
professionals-realm.
   Among other things, he has used a computer to generate
lists of words that include seven of the letters he is most
likely to find on his rack, plus one more letter. Chuck
drills himself on those words to keep them fresh in his mind.
He plays Scrabble six hours or so a week and studies for more
than an hour a day. The image that endures of him is of the
dutiful father strolling around his living room carrying a
screaming infant in a Snugli and studying his flashcards. At
his first nationals, in <DATE>1988</DATE>, <PERSON>Chuck</PERSON> finished 16th. "Lucky,"
he said. The next year, he slipped to 19th. "Unlucky," he
explained. Last year, in his third try, he finished eighth
and had clearly become a force in the game. When a friend of
our father's went to a tournament and asked a player to point
him toward <PERSON>Chuck</PERSON>, he got the sort of stunned silence he would
have expected if he had wandered into a <LOCATION>Little Italy</LOCATION> social
club and asked to see <PERSON>John Gotti</PERSON>.
   This <DATE>August</DATE>, against the toughest field assembled in
years, <PERSON>Chuck</PERSON> was on a roll. Although the tournament didn't
carry the imprimatur of <PERSON>Milton Bradley</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Scrabble</ORGANIZATION>'s owner, it
did include all the big names, such as <PERSON>Robert Felt</PERSON>, the
reigning official champ because he won the <DATE>1990</DATE> national
tournament.
   In one game, <PERSON>Chuck</PERSON>'s first three plays were "bronzier,"
"oracular" and "notturni," giving him three 50-point bonuses
for playing all seven letters in his rack. The score at that
point was 215 to 26. In another game, <PERSON>Chuck</PERSON>'s opponent got
50-point bonuses -- known as "bingos" -- on his first two
turns but found himself trailing Chuck by 190 points. Chuck
had scored a career-high 212 points on one word, "landform,"
which hit two triple-word scores. Other games produced the
words "zoeae," "codeia," "tirrivee," "duvetyn," "beigy" and
"qaids" (the latter, which according to the <ORGANIZATION>Official Scrabble
Player</ORGANIZATION>'s Dictionary means "Far Eastern rulers," turns out to
be one of the most common plays in high-level Scrabble).
   Nobody much watched the tournament, with its 160
contestants huddled over their boards for 20 hours over 4 1/2
days in the ballroom of a <LOCATION>Cincinnati</LOCATION> hotel. "Too boring,"
<PERSON>Chuck</PERSON> said. But there was plenty of tension going into the
final day's play, as <PERSON>Chuck</PERSON>'s 18-6 record tied him with three
others for first. He was ahead on the tiebreaker, the spread
between the points he had scored and the total his opponents
had scored, but he also was worried. He had to start off
against <PERSON>Peter Morris</PERSON>, a former champion who <PERSON>Chuck</PERSON> describes
as "the smartest person who plays Scrabble."
   Chuck played "yclepe," which was a "phony," or fake word,
that looked like two Old English words. But <PERSON>Morris</PERSON> is a
graduate student specializing in Victorian literature and
caught it right away. Chuck lost big after <PERSON>Morris</PERSON> challenged.
When <PERSON>Chuck</PERSON> and <PERSON>Morris</PERSON> both won their next games, they were
pitted against each other in the final game. Chuck not only
had to win, he had to win by 143 points to have the better
spread. "A hundred-to-one shot," <PERSON>Chuck</PERSON> said.
   But <PERSON>Chuck</PERSON> got both blanks in the final game and played
four bingos, including "klavern," a <PERSON>Ku Klux Klan</PERSON> cell. Things
got tight when <PERSON>Chuck</PERSON> drew the "q" right at the end with
nowhere to play it, especially because <PERSON>Chuck</PERSON> describes <PERSON>Morris</PERSON>
as "the best end-game player in the history of the world."
Still, <PERSON>Chuck</PERSON> won by 152 points.
   Chuck collected his check for <MONEY>$3,900</MONEY> and celebrated by
taking the bus to <LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION>. He used the time to study
words. It's a good thing, since players at the world
championship will be able to use words from all official
English-language Scrabble dictionaries, so <PERSON>Chuck</PERSON> had 20,000
words to learn by this week.

How many bona fide two-letter words are there in English? Anyone knowing the
answer off pat will probably be an addict of Scrabble (in which short words
can be decisive in end-play) and so have cause to lament the death of the
game's <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> inventor Alfred Butts.
As old as the century and an architect by training, he devised the
word-based board game in the <DATE>1930s</DATE> only to have it turned down by
manufacturers in the field. It was not until the early <DATE>1950s</DATE> that the <ORGANIZATION>Macy</ORGANIZATION>'s
retail chain began selling Scrabble, paving the way for an estimated total
sale in various languages which still seems low at 100m. He said he earned
only a few cents on each.
As for the two-letter words, according to <ORGANIZATION>Chambers English Dictionary</ORGANIZATION>, the
number is 106. The three-letter variety are far more plentiful, with 1,087.

FT  13 JUL 94 / (CORRECTED) UK Company News: Hasbro gives up on Spear
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Correction (published 14th <DATE>July 1994</DATE>) appended to this article.
Hasbro yesterday threw in its hand in the battle for JW Spear, the maker of
<ORGANIZATION>Scrabble</ORGANIZATION>, and said it would accept the Pounds 11.50 a share bid from US toy
rival <ORGANIZATION>Mattel</ORGANIZATION>.
It described the Pounds 62m offer as 'very generous and above a level which
we could justify in business terms'.
The decision ends a fierce scrap over <LOCATION>Spear</LOCATION>, which started when <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION>
launched a 900p a share bid for the company at the end of <DATE>May</DATE>. It had held a
26.7 per cent stake since <DATE>1990</DATE> and had received undertakings from the
trustees of some <PERSON>Spear</PERSON> family trusts to sell their 24.9 per cent stake
unless a higher offer was received within three working days.
After a frantic search for a white knight, <ORGANIZATION>Hambro</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Spear</ORGANIZATION>'s merchant bank,
persuaded <ORGANIZATION>Mattel</ORGANIZATION> to launch a rival bid at Pounds 10 a share five minutes
before the deadline. Hasbro came back with an Pounds 11 a share offer last
<DATE>Friday</DATE>, which was topped by <ORGANIZATION>Mattel</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>.
<PERSON>Mr Norman Walker</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro International</ORGANIZATION>, said: 'Our offer at
Pounds 11 per share was a very full one which we are not prepared to
increase. We are very pleased at the outcome for all shareholders and will
of course realise a substantial gain on our own investment which we made in
<DATE>1990</DATE>.' Hasbro bought its original stake at under Pounds 3 a share.
The outcome leaves the rights to Scrabble divided between <ORGANIZATION>Mattel</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION>,
which are fierce rivals in the doll market. <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION>, maker of <LOCATION>Sindy</LOCATION>, retains
the rights to Scrabble in <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION>, leaving <ORGANIZATION>Barbie</ORGANIZATION>'s creator, <ORGANIZATION>Mattel</ORGANIZATION>,
with the rest of the world.
<ORGANIZATION>Mattel</ORGANIZATION>'s victory is particularly sweet for <PERSON>Robert Fleming</PERSON>, the merchant
bank. It was appointed by <ORGANIZATION>Mattel</ORGANIZATION> just six hours before the initial offer had
to be launched and completed the task with a few minutes to spare.
CORRECTION
JW Spear's merchant bank, which handled its successful sale to <ORGANIZATION>Mattel</ORGANIZATION>,
was <PERSON>Barings</PERSON> not Hambros as stated yesterday.

<LEADPARA>  THE first time I placed a personal ad in a magazine, they said: "Just be
honest. Describe yourself, your likes and dislikes, and the type of woman

handed me a slip of paper and a No. 2 pencil, and I wrote: "Short,

take over my car payments and engage in occasional desultory sex. I like to
drink rum out of a jelly glass and play Scrabble; that's about it."  </LEADPARA>

<MEMO>  Cowherd is a columnist for the Baltimore Evening Sun.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     The whole thing came to -- let's see -- 40 words. Cost me 30 bucks. Then I
went home and waited for the responses to roll in. Nothing. Zero. It was
unbelievable.;    Every day I'd stand out by the mailbox waiting for a
postcard from some hot-looking babe who wanted a shot at an advanced Scrabble
player. And every day Ted, my postman, would walk by and shake his head and
sing out: "Nothing for you today, Occupant!";    Finally, after a month or so
of no responses, I threw my hands in the air and shouted: "That's it! I'm
quitting the dating scene! I don't know what these women want anymore!";    A
buddy of mine, <PERSON>Neil</PERSON>, happened to be over the day I went ballistic. He asked to
see my personal ad and studied it for several minutes.;    "You gotta punch it
up a little bit," he said finally. "There must be something you like to do
besides play Scrabble.";    Not really, I said. For a while there, I was
hooked on Sorry. And before that I'd play a lot of Hungry, <ORGANIZATION>Hungry Hippo</ORGANIZATION>, which
is a game my 4-year-old niece turned me onto where you try to capture marbles
in a plastic cup shaped like a hippopotamus.;    But lately, I said, it's been
mostly Scrabble. Not to brag or anything, but I should point out . . .;   
"Listen," <PERSON>Neil</PERSON> said, "lose that Scrabble stuff. Put something in the ad like:
'Has won over 25 bowling trophies.' They'll be beating down the doors to go
out with you.";    <PERSON>Neil</PERSON> knows women, you've got to give him that. But I needed
a second opinion, which is the reason I showed the ad to <PERSON>Sarah Jean</PERSON> down at
the Laundromat.;    <PERSON>Sarah Jean</PERSON> was pretty busy making change; all 24 washers
and dryers were humming and she was cranking the quarters off the changer on
her belt so fast you could barely see her fingers.;    But finally she stopped
saying, "How much you need, Sugar?" and took a minute to look at my ad.;   
From the expression on her face, she didn't like what she was seeing -- unless
it was the No. 9 dryer knocking with those tennis shoes that was bothering
her.;    "Part of the problem," she said between drags on a Salem, "is your
opening sentence, especially that 'short, unattractive man with thick glasses'
business. A lot of women don't go for that type of guy.";    Man, I could have
kicked myself. She was right, of course. The more I thought about it, you
don't see too many <PERSON>Meg Ryan</PERSON> types with ugly, stumpy guys with Coke-bottle
glasses -- Scrabble background or no Scrabble background.;    Why I didn't
think of that in the first place is beyond me. Just stupid, I guess. Yeah,
that's it. Maybe the ad should have read: "Short, stupid, unattractive man
with thick glasses seeks . . .";    "Another thing," said <PERSON>Sarah Jean</PERSON>, "you
can't just say you're looking for someone to cook and pay for your car and
have sex with. That's going to turn women off. It's too -- honest.";    Well.
This was a fine how-do-you-do. Here the folks at the magazine were saying: "Be
truthful." But <PERSON>Sarah Jean</PERSON> was saying: "Sugar, to play this game, you gotta lie
like a rug.";    Anyway, once the morning rush was over, <PERSON>Sarah Jean</PERSON> and I sat
down and wrote out a new personal ad on the back of an empty box of Tide.;   
Actually, she dictated and I wrote with a big red Magic Marker that <PERSON>Earl</PERSON>,
<PERSON>Sarah Jean</PERSON>'s boss, uses to make up "This Dryer Out of Order" signs.;    "Tall,
rugged-looking Harvard grad seeks attractive, non-argumentative, financially
well-off woman for quiet candlelight dinners (your place), help with
philanthropic causes, erotic adventure (though on a limited basis.) Must have
sense of humor. Proficiency at spelling and board games preferred.";    I
don't know -- it doesn't really sound like my kind of personal. Plus I had to
pony up another 30 bucks to get it into the magazine.;    <PERSON>Sarah Jean</PERSON>, she can
get a little wordy.  </TEXT>

</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION> is to receive warrants to purchase 1 million shares of <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION> stock as

<P>
If the deal is approved, most of <ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION>'s 250 employees are expected to be laid

FT  21 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Reduced deficit at JW Spear
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
JW Spear, the Enfield-based toys and games manufacturer, reported sharply
reduced losses in its seasonally unfavourable first half.
Losses before tax were Pounds 315,000 for the six months to <DATE>June 30</DATE>, down
from Pounds 638,000 at the same stage of <DATE>1991</DATE>. The group, famed for its
Scrabble game, achieved profits of Pounds 2.53m pre-tax in the full <DATE>1991</DATE>
year.
The outcome reflected lower interest payable of Pounds 5,000 (Pounds
125,000). Turnover was marginally lower at Pounds 8.28m as <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> proved a
'lacklustre' market following the impact of video games, said <PERSON>Mr Francis
Spear</PERSON>, chairman.
Losses per share were cut to 5.78p (8.19p) and the interim dividend goes up
to 2.5p (2p).

<PERSON>Handel</PERSON> said.
   <ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION> has about 75 salaried workers in <LOCATION>Avon</LOCATION>, 75 in <LOCATION>Mayfield</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>, and a total of about 100 assembly line workers at both
locations.
   ``Coleco always stood for innovation and the ability to take
risks,'' said <PERSON>Paul Valentine</PERSON>, a toy analyst with <ORGANIZATION>Standard &amp; Poors
Corp.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. ``The industry is poorer because of their
demise.''
   Russian immigrant <PERSON>Maurice Greenberg</PERSON> founded the <ORGANIZATION>Connecticut
Leather Co.</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1932</DATE>. The company expanded its leather and shoe
products line to toys in <DATE>1954</DATE> and its name was changed to <ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION> in
<DATE>1961</DATE>.
   Analysts said <ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION> ran into trouble after the phenomenal
success of the Cabbage Patch doll, which became the best-selling toy
of all-time with more than <MONEY>$600 million</MONEY> in sales in <DATE>1985</DATE>.
   <PERSON>David Leibowitz</PERSON>, senior vice president of <ORGANIZATION>American Securities
Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION> borrowed money to expand after the Cabbage Patch
success.
   But when Cabbage Patch Kids sales tumbled and new products,
including <PERSON>Adams</PERSON> home computer and toys based on the Rambo movies,
did not sell, <ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION> couldn't pay off the new debts, he said.
   ``They managed their company for a sales revival that never
came,'' <PERSON>Valentine</PERSON> said.
   <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION>, which makes GI <PERSON>Joe</PERSON>, <PERSON>Mr. Potato Head</PERSON>, My Little Pony and
<ORGANIZATION>Transformers</ORGANIZATION>, had sales of <MONEY>$1.34 billion</MONEY> last year, up from just
<MONEY>$104.3 million</MONEY> in <DATE>1980</DATE>. <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION> in the <DATE>last decade</DATE> has bought
big-name companies including <ORGANIZATION>Milton Bradley Co.</ORGANIZATION> and introduced a
steady stream of new products.
   Hasbro Executive Vice President <PERSON>Barry Alperin</PERSON> said of the <ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION>
deal: ``It means the acquisition of good, stable game products, like
Scrabble, Parcheesi and Aggravation ... and it's a good chance to
add to our toy division.''
   After the transaction, <ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION> will have as much as <MONEY>$150 million</MONEY>
in cash, <MONEY>$85 million</MONEY> from <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION> and about <MONEY>$65 million</MONEY> it had in
banks in mid-March, <PERSON>Handel</PERSON> said. The cash will be used to pay off
the company's debts, he said.
   <ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION> also said it would retain some real estate assets, which
will be converted to cash.
   The companies also agreed that <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION> will participate in <ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION>
business operations up to the close of the transaction as part of a
management consulting agreement.

<TEXT>
Who will finally bag J W Spear, the UK owner of Scrabble? Will it be mighty
<ORGANIZATION>Mattel</ORGANIZATION>, manufacturer of <ORGANIZATION>Barbie</ORGANIZATION>, aged 35? Or will <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION>, handler of <LOCATION>Sindy</LOCATION>,
33, finally win through? Hasbro was first, valuing Spear at almost Pounds
47m, but <ORGANIZATION>Mattel</ORGANIZATION> squeezed in <DATE>last Friday</DATE>, valuing it at Pounds 52m.
Observer understands the matter has already passed into the hands of two top
executives, charged with thrashing out a compromise. Here's an excerpt of a
crucial weekend phone call.
S: Whaddya mean by this, tryin' to upstage ma show? Old man Spear has
already said he's happy with us.
B: Off your high horse, gal. All's fair in love, war and business. The other
Scrabble guys go for me.
S: Cheapskate] Flashing your legs ain't gonna make no difference.
B: At least I got legs worth flashing - punters paid more than Dollars 1bn
for me last year. And I got 55 per cent of the fashion doll market. You only
got 32 per cent, honey.
S: You ain't got a decent pedigree, sweetie pie. Ah'm British, through and
through.
B: British? Don't crease me up. You ain't been British since <DATE>1986</DATE>.
S: I jest know that Spear likes my looks better than yours.
B: Butt out, kiddo - your looks were a damn sight better before you got a
nose job in <DATE>'92</DATE>.
S: That was only 'cos you bitched so loudly that I was better-looking than
you.
B: Lighten up, loser. You ain't gotta hope in hell.
S: (Sounds of sniffles).

FT  04 JUN 94 / Markets: Barbie and Sindy v Ken and Eddie - London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As double acts go, Barbie and <PERSON>Sindy</PERSON> may be less edifying than <PERSON>Ken and Eddie</PERSON>,
but more electrifying to investors. A rally of the dolls is underway with
their respective parents, <ORGANIZATION>Mattel</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION>, battling each other for control
of <ORGANIZATION>JW Spear &amp; Sons</ORGANIZATION>, the British toy maker. Spear's stock is already up 58
per cent from its <DATE>January</DATE> low to 750p with every last Scrabble tile still to
fight for.
But is the stock market's uplift this week - achieved without assistance
from Chancellor <PERSON>Kenneth Clarke</PERSON> or Governor <PERSON>Eddy George</PERSON> - anything more than
a cosmetic correction?
After the dreadful drubbing stocks and bonds suffered the previous week, the
tide turned on <DATE>Thursday</DATE> in the futures markets. The cash markets too saw
some genuine buyers attracted by near 9 per cent long gilt yields and 4 per
cent dividend yields.
The upturn proved fragile yesterday. No sooner did the latest US payroll
figures hit screens at lunchtime, than stocks and bonds headed south again.
Only when US bonds rebounded on some comforting words from the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION>
did UK markets recover their poise. The <ORGANIZATION>FT-SE</ORGANIZATION> 100 index finished with a 31.4
point gain on the week at 2,997.8.
Few investors doubt there is genuine value in equities and gilts at these
levels but none are in a hurry to buy. 'We feel slightly spoiled for
choice,' says <PERSON>David Manning</PERSON>, director of UK equities at <ORGANIZATION>Legal &amp; General</ORGANIZATION>, a
large institutional investor. But there is no need to rush to invest in
either market. 'They will still be here in two or three months' time at the
same sort of levels.'
One factor holding him back is the high yield on index linked gilts. Not
only is the 4 per cent return virtually the same as the stock market's
average dividend yield but it is also risk-free.
As the first of the accompanying charts show, the index linked yield is high
by historic standards apart from the period 1990-92 when it was boosted by
sterling's membership of the <ORGANIZATION>ERM</ORGANIZATION>. It is hard to envisage yields rising much
further. But even if the bond market fails to rally and achieves only
stability, equities could still gradually recover.
'If indexed linked yields do stabilise and one looks out through <DATE>1994</DATE> and
<DATE>1995</DATE> one can see an equity yield premium re-emerging fairly rapidly,' say
strategists at <ORGANIZATION>SG Warburg Securities</ORGANIZATION>, thanks to rapid dividend growth.
As the second chart shows, the dividend yield has rarely been so close to
the index linked gilt yield apart from the run up to the <DATE>1987</DATE> crash. At
current levels, equities are expensive but will become more attractive as
dividends grow and the yield ratio rises.
Such a modest stock market improvement later this year, led by expanding
earnings and dividends, seems much more likely than one led by a bond market
rally and falling interest rates. Even though a long gilt yield of around <MONEY>9
per cent</MONEY> is discounting more inflation than most people expect, there are
too many economic uncertainties at home and abroad for investors to chase
bond prices higher.
A parallel can be drawn with the market in mid-1985, says <PERSON>Vivian Bazalgette</PERSON>,
managing director of <ORGANIZATION>Gartmore Pension Fund Managers</ORGANIZATION>. 'This is a mid-cycle
reaction when the market is switching from being interest rate to earnings
driven. We see scope for the market to rise to its former peak or even a
little higher by the end of the year.' <ORGANIZATION>Gartmore</ORGANIZATION> has remained slightly
overweight in UK equities throughout the market's 15 per cent correction
from its <DATE>February</DATE> peak.
Most other UK institutional investors are also well represented in domestic
equities so they may not be a source of particularly heavy buying when the
market begins to recover. However, there are stocks to cherry pick. Legal
and <ORGANIZATION>General</ORGANIZATION>, for example, likes those big international stocks in the
Footsie which offer above average dividend yield and exposure to the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>
economy.
No companies reporting this week fit the profile although <ORGANIZATION>Siebe</ORGANIZATION> fails only
on the dividend count. The controls maker reported a 20 per cent rise in
pre-tax profits for the year to Pounds 217.2m and an 11.6 per cent increase
in full-year dividend to 11p for a gross yield of 2.4 per cent. Its
underlying profit margins held up through the recession and it is now
enjoying some growth in demand in the <LOCATION>Americas</LOCATION> and elsewhere.
The most pleasant results surprise came from Boots. Reporting pre-tax
profits for the year up 19 per cent to Pounds 484.4m and the dividend up 12
per cent to 15p, it shook off some of the investor doubts which have dogged
it for the past 18 months. It has yet to work out what to do with its
struggling drugs business or to show it can make money in the do-it-yourself
sector, but there is no doubting the strength of its core retailing
business.
In contrast, elsewhere in the retail sector, <ORGANIZATION>Kingfisher</ORGANIZATION> delivered a rather
downbeat annual general meeting statement. First quarter sales volume was
lower than a year earlier and its 'every day low-pricing' policy is still
not paying off convincingly. Its shares lost more ground and are now down 33
per cent from their high for the year of 778p.
<ORGANIZATION>Granada Group</ORGANIZATION> offered the most sparkling performance of the week. Its
interim pre-tax profits were up 51 per cent to Pounds 103m and its dividend
up 10 per cent at 3.33p. Acquisitions in catering and textile rental were
big contributors while LWT, the television franchise, chipped in only
one-month so far.
Although <ORGANIZATION>Granada</ORGANIZATION>'s results attest in part to the profitable audience for
glamorous game shows, <ORGANIZATION>Barbie</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Sindy</PERSON> are fighting on a higher intellectual
plane. Not for them the fripperies of outfits, accessories and hairstyle
they normally crave. This time they are each after <ORGANIZATION>Spear</ORGANIZATION>'s Scrabble
franchise. Sadly, there would be little contest if they challenged <PERSON>Ken</PERSON> and
<PERSON>Eddie</PERSON> to a game.

   Fourteen-year-old <PERSON>Adam Logan</PERSON> says he doesn't

<DATE>Sunday</DATE>'s first game of the <DATE>1989</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>National Scrabble Championship</ORGANIZATION>.
   <LOCATION>Logan</LOCATION>, a high school student from <LOCATION>Ottawa</LOCATION>, is the youngest of the

competing at the <ORGANIZATION>New York Penta</ORGANIZATION> hotel in midtown <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION>.
   The competitors are from 30 states and eight other countries.
   The <DATE>1987</DATE> champion, <PERSON>Rita Norr</PERSON> of <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION>, is the only woman
to win the 7-year-old tournament.
   ``Some people feel that the women don't have the killer
instinct,'' she said. ``I'm not sure that that's really it. Men
maybe have the freedom to concentrate more on the game.''
   Norr, a freelance mathematics textbook writer with a computer
science background, said the game is more than knowledge of words.
   ``It's very mathematical,'' she said. ``A lot of it's even
spatial relationships and decisions about when to challenge, when
not to challenge, when to close the board, when to open it,
constantly keeping track of where you are in the game and how many
tiles are left.''
   But <PERSON>Loera Thompson</PERSON>, a 75-year-old <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION> native, doesn't

FT  20 NOV 92 / Survey of Home Entertainment (6): Monopoly is still leading
the field - Non-Electronic Games
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PURVEYORS of <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s board games must have blanched at the news of fights
breaking out among several thousand youngsters locked out of a computer
games exhibition in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> <DATE>earlier this month</DATE>.
It is not the sort of thing that happens in the staid world of
non-electronic games, where Monopoly (circa <DATE>1930</DATE>) remains the number one
seller, followed by old rivals Cluedo (circa <DATE>1950</DATE>), Scrabble and the newer
Trivial Pursuit.
'The traditional board games offer a good value way of bridging the
generation gap and in which all the family can participate,' says <PERSON>Mr Alan
Thompson</PERSON>, managing director of <ORGANIZATION>Waddington Games</ORGANIZATION>, makers of Monopoly.
'Computer games are usually designed for single players.'
However, the new wave of electronic entertainment has dented the growth in
board game sales, although they have held up well in the face of the
recession.
Last year, board game sales grew to Pounds 127m from Pounds 114m in <DATE>1988</DATE>,
with Monopoly selling 300,000 units - and <ORGANIZATION>Junior Monopoly</ORGANIZATION> an additional
200,000.
New growth areas are generally limited to one-off blockbusters such as
Trivial Pursuit, or adaptations from television game shows. Hence healthy
sales are expected this <DATE>Christmas</DATE> for the likes of 'Big Break', 'Give us a
Clue' and 'TV Addicts'. Toy executives maintain close contacts with
television companies, producing a two-way stream of games linked to TV and
vice versa.
Meanwhile, <PERSON>Subbuteo</PERSON>, the table football game, has seen a seven-fold increase
in sales in the past six years, mirroring renewed interest in the domestic
game. There has also been a flood of games on the 'Dungeons and <ORGANIZATION>Dragons</ORGANIZATION>'
theme.
However, a stroll down the aisle of any large toy store reveals hundreds of
board games lacking either the pull of television support or the staying
power of the established giants. One cannot help but fear a short shelf life
for the likes of '<ORGANIZATION>Mall Madness</ORGANIZATION>' and 'Beware the Bog]'.
The cost of introducing new games is high, with its success dependent on
good distribution. Periphery players also struggle because with two-thirds
of sales made in the Christmas period, large amounts of stock have to be
held throughout the year. 'I think the industry will become centred around
fewer players,' says <PERSON>Mr Thompson</PERSON>. Experienced toy industry watchers predict
a New Year fall-out for some of the smaller manufacturers.
One of the few new companies to make in-roads into the UK market is the
Japanese group <PERSON>Tomy</PERSON>, which in the past 10 years has seen its sales grow from
zero to Pounds 60m.
With no traditional board game as a backbone, <PERSON>Tomy</PERSON> has concentrated on
developing activity games with an emphasis on skill and dexterity. 'There's
nothing more boring than a flat piece of cardboard,' says <PERSON>Mr Peter Brown</PERSON>,
managing director of <ORGANIZATION>Tomy UK</ORGANIZATION>. 'People, and especially children, want
something extra to do while they're playing.'
But despite <PERSON>Tomy</PERSON>'s efforts to widen the market, the search for the lucrative
'new Monopoly' continues to exercise not only some of the great minds of the
toy world, but also the British public.
<PERSON>Mr Brown</PERSON> says he receives up to a dozen suggestions a week from the public
for new board games. At Waddingtons the number of suggestions regularly runs
to a hundred. In the meantime, Monopoly looks likely to live up to its title
and maintain its dominant position.

FT  24 MAR 93 / UK Company News: JW Spear shows 46% improvement to Pounds
3.7m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JW SPEAR, the maker of Scrabble and other games, yesterday announced profits
up by more than 46 per cent to Pounds 3.71m for the year to <DATE>December 31</DATE>,
compared with Pounds 2.53m.
The group switched pension fund managers from Scottish Amicable to Scottish
Widows at the beginning of <DATE>1992</DATE> following 'lacklustre performance', <PERSON>Mr Paul
Lipscombe</PERSON>, finance director, said.
Last <DATE>July</DATE> the routine actuarial revaluation had revealed a further charge to
the profit and loss reserve bringing the total to about Pounds 700,000 over
the <DATE>last two years</DATE>.
The charge was partly due to a shortfall between the fund's performance and
its projected liabilities.
The advance in profits came on turnover up 20 per cent, from Pounds 27.3m to
Pounds 32.8m.
Margins improved to more than <MONEY>12 per cent</MONEY> (10.5 per cent).
Distribution costs rose some 40 per cent to Pounds 9.77m against Pounds
7.99m for the preceding year, mainly because of royalties paid under a
licensing arrangement for Atmosfear, the interactive video game.
A proposed final dividend of 11.5p (8p) brings the total distribution for
the year to 14p (10p) payable from earnings per share ahead from 32.3p to
47.3p.

Advisers to Scrabble maker J W Spear were <TIME>last night</TIME> still searching for a
white knight to top the Pounds 47m bid for the company from US toy giant
<ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION>.
But it looked increasingly unlikely that their efforts would be successful
ahead of <TIME>this morning</TIME>'s deadline when acceptances from Spear family trusts
owning 24.9 per cent of the shares become irrevocable.
<ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION> already has a 26.7 per cent stake in Spear acquired four years ago.
Barings has asked the Spear trustees to forward a letter to the

   Toy company <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro Inc.</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Thursday</DATE> said
better profit margins and improved performances by its <PERSON>Milton
Bradley</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Playskool</ORGANIZATION> units helped <DATE>third-quarter</DATE> earnings rise <PERCENT>73
percent</PERCENT>.
   The company reported earnings of <MONEY>$31.3 million</MONEY>, or <MONEY>53 cents</MONEY> per

   ``As anticipated, our <DATE>third quarter</DATE> gross profit margin improved
from that of the <DATE>second quarter</DATE>,'' said <PERSON>Alan G. Hassenfeld</PERSON>,
chairman and chief executive.
   Along with better revenue by <PERSON>Milton Bradley</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Playskool</ORGANIZATION>, which
concentrates on toys for infants and young children, international
operations showed improvement, despite being hurt by a strong
dollar, <PERSON>Hassenfeld</PERSON> said.
   Analysts had said the <PERSON>Milton Bradley</PERSON> unit's board games could
take a beating from video games.
   Hasbro recently bought many of the products formerly
manufactured by <ORGANIZATION>Coleco Industries Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, including Cabbage Patch
dolls, <ORGANIZATION>Scrabble</ORGANIZATION> and Parcheesi.
   These additions plus a new line of battery powered racing cars
called <ORGANIZATION>Record Breakers</ORGANIZATION> places <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION> in a good position to enter

   For the first nine months of this year, <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION> earned <MONEY>$68.2

Good sales in the run up to <LOCATION>Christmas</LOCATION> helped <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION>, the biggest US toy
maker, report a <MONEY>12 per cent</MONEY> increase in <DATE>fourth-quarter</DATE> turnover to Dollars
932.2m. But a charge to cover the cost of closing its factory in the
<LOCATION>Netherlands</LOCATION>, announced last month, limited profits growth to <MONEY>8 per cent</MONEY>.
Net income was Dollars 70.7m compared with Dollars 65.6m last time, while
earnings per share were <MONEY>7 per cent</MONEY> ahead at <MONEY>78 cents</MONEY>. <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION> said if it had
not been for the Dollars 15m charge it took against pre-tax profits for the
plant closure, net income would have risen by 22 per cent.
<ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION> said some of its biggest domestic successes came from its <ORGANIZATION>Kenner</ORGANIZATION>
division, which handles its Littlest Pet Shop and Jurassic Park lines.
<ORGANIZATION>Hasbro Toy</ORGANIZATION>, after difficulties earlier in the year, saw good sales of
<ORGANIZATION>Tonka</ORGANIZATION>'s Talk 'n Play Fire Truck and The Real Power Tool Shop.
The Playskool operation was buoyed by successes with <ORGANIZATION>Talking Barney</ORGANIZATION> and
traditional products like Play-Doh and <ORGANIZATION>Tinkertoy</ORGANIZATION>. The games division saw
good sales of new products like Don't Wake Daddy, Ask Zandar and Jenga, and
traditional games like Monopoly, Scrabble and The Game of Life.
Internationally, the company saw strong performances from its operations in
<LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>, but suffered the currency translation
effects of the rising <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> dollar.
For the full year, revenues rose by <MONEY>8 per cent</MONEY> to Dollars 2.7bn, net income
rose by 12 per cent to <ORGANIZATION>Dollars</ORGANIZATION> 200m, and earnings per share rose by 10 per
cent to Dollars 2.22.
<ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION> will join other US toy manufacturers in unveiling its new products
for <DATE>1994</DATE> at the <ORGANIZATION>American International Toy Fair</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> next week.

<HEAD>Hasbro Agrees to Purchase Certain Assets in Coleco Lines</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PAWTUCKET, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro Inc.</ORGANIZATION> announced <DATE>Monday</DATE> it has
agreed to purchase certain assets of the indoor-outdoor children's
furniture and ride-on divisions of financially troubled <ORGANIZATION>Coleco
Industries Inc.</ORGANIZATION> for <MONEY>$21 million</MONEY>.
   Under the agreement, <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION> officials said it will purchase
specific assets, including inventory and tooling, machinery and
equipment and some property rights.
   <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION> will also buy two manufacturing facilities in <LOCATION>Amsterdam</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>, officials said, where the acquired product lines are produced.
   The lines include plastic wading and splashing pools, pool
filers, children's outdoor furniture and clubhouses, and pedal- and
battery-operated cycles.
   Those lines, which helped launched <ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION> in the toy business in
<DATE>1956</DATE>, had sales last year of <MONEY>$77 million</MONEY>. The toymaker is based in
<LOCATION>West Hartford</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Conn</LOCATION>.
   ``The addition of these products will provide additional balance
and stability to our overall line,'' said <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON>Stephen
Hassenfeld</PERSON> in a printed release.
   The agreement is subject to approval by the board of directors
of both companies.
   The deal has been a topic of speculation for more than a month.
   <ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION> has been trying since <DATE>March</DATE> without success to
restructure its massive debt.
   The company had proposed exchanging <MONEY>$335 million</MONEY> of bonds for a
combination of new bonds and stock, saying the exchange would save
it <MONEY>millions of dollars</MONEY> a year in interest payments and supply cash
for the business.
   When that plan collapsed, <ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION> received short-term financing
from a group of 12 foreign and domestic lenders, to which it owes
<MONEY>$103 million</MONEY>.
   The company produces such well-known toys as Cabbage Patch Kids
dolls and Scrabble board games. It lost <MONEY>$47.4 million</MONEY> in the <DATE>first
quarter</DATE> that ended <DATE>April 2</DATE>. It has lost money in four of the past
five years, including <MONEY>$215 million</MONEY> in the <DATE>last two years</DATE>.

<TEXT>
   <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro Inc.</ORGANIZATION> plans to begin producing
popular Cabbage Patch Kids dolls immediately now that it has
completed the purchase of most product lines from financially
troubled <ORGANIZATION>Coleco Industries Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, the company says.
   <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest toymaker, completed its purchase of
<ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION>'s major assets on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> for <MONEY>$85 million</MONEY> cash and an
option for <ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION> to purchase 1 million shares of <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION> at <MONEY>$28.85</MONEY>
after its bankruptcy plan was confirmed, said <PERSON>Barry Alperin</PERSON>,
<ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION>'s executive vice president.
   Hasbro closed at <MONEY>$20</MONEY> on the <ORGANIZATION>American Exchange</ORGANIZATION> <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, down <MONEY>25
cents</MONEY>.
   The Pawtucket-based company said it had reached agreement with
Original Appalachian Artworks, owner and creator of Cabbage Patch
Kids, to begin manufacturing the dolls immediately, in time to
advertise them for <DATE>Christmas</DATE>.
   The dolls would be made overseas and packaged at <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Milton
Bradley</PERSON> division in <LOCATION>East Longmeadow</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Alperin</PERSON> said. Most of
<ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION>'s other lines, including Scrabble, <LOCATION>Parcheesi</LOCATION>, Perfection and
Aggravation, also would be produced in <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION>.
   ``<PERSON>Milton Bradley</PERSON> ... has the capacity there and they've handled
things like this before,'' <PERSON>Alperin</PERSON> said.
   <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION> also bought the right to use <ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION>'s name and would
discontinue some of its products, including Alf and Wrinkles,
<PERSON>Alperin</PERSON> said.
   Chairman <PERSON>Alan G. Hassenfeld</PERSON> said the acquisition would add ``some
time-tested products which will enrich <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION>'s three divisions
without material additions to our cost structure.''
   <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION>'s third division is Playskool.
   ``We will be putting on some people to handle Cabbage Patch, but
we're talking tens or twentys,'' <PERSON>Alperin</PERSON> said. ``These are short
term decisions and we'll deal with this on a long term basis as we
get into it.''
   <PERSON>Alperin</PERSON> said the Cabbage Patch line, which was the largest
selling toy of all time in <DATE>1985</DATE>, ``has not had the attention it
deserved over the past couple of years.''
   Sales of Cabbage Patch peaked at more than <MONEY>$600 million</MONEY> in <DATE>1985</DATE>,
compared with <MONEY>$58 million</MONEY> last year.
   But the transaction's success does not rest solely on Cabbage
Patch products, <PERSON>Alperin</PERSON> said. Some of the board games, for example,
``are tried and true names in the games field,'' he said.
   Alperin would not release internal figures estimating projected
revenues for the new products.
   <ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION> is far from <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION>'s most ambitious purchase. It aqcuired
<PERSON>Milton Bradley</PERSON> in <DATE>1984</DATE> for more than <MONEY>$350 million</MONEY>, <PERSON>Alperin</PERSON> said.
   The Connecticut-based <ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION> filed for protection from its
creditors under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Act a year ago,
citing debts of <MONEY>$540.3 million</MONEY>.

<ORGANIZATION>Hasbro Inc.</ORGANIZATION> officials refused to comment <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> on published reports that the

to be presented in bankruptcy court. 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>Hartford Courant</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> quoted sources close to Avon-based <ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION>'s

<PERSON>Barry Alperin</PERSON>, executive vice president of <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, said representatives of

<P>
A secretary for <ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION>'s chairman, <PERSON>Morton Handel</PERSON>, said he would be away from

<P>
The deal, expected to be announced today, would strengthen <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION>'s position in

Cabbage Patch Kids and the board games Scrabble and Parcheesi. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION> grew into one of the nation's largest toy makers over the past decade,

Demand for the dolls dropped beginning in <DATE>1986</DATE> and <ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION> was unsuccessful in 
introducing new products.

<HEAD>Woman Celebrates Her 109th Birthday</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROSEBURG, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nina Rust rode an elephant and an airplane
on previous birthdays, but this year she took it easy. It was,
after all, her 109th year.
   The <LOCATION>Roseburg</LOCATION> woman went to the Wildlife Safari animal park in
<LOCATION>Winston</LOCATION> for her birthday <DATE>Monday</DATE> and had lunch at the <LOCATION>White Rhino</LOCATION>
restaurant overlooking a pond and an island providing habitat for
white gibbon apes.
   On her <DATE>99th birthday</DATE>, she went to the animal park to take her
first elephant ride. She decided the ride was a bit bumpy and has
never duplicated the feat. On her 100th, she had her first airplane
flight
   In <DATE>1982</DATE>, at age 101, she drove back to <LOCATION>Lincoln</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Neb.</LOCATION>, with her
daughter, <PERSON>Phyllis McMeekin</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Roseburg</LOCATION>, for a family gathering.
They then flew to <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> and toured several <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> states.
   When she turned 103, ``Dear Reader,'' a book about Rust's life
was published. It was written by <PERSON>McMeekin</PERSON>, with whom Rust has lived
for the past 35 years. Also in <DATE>1984</DATE>, Rust's first
great-great-great-grandchild was born.
   Although not a first, Rust danced with her son-in-law and
another man on her 105th birthday during a party at the Senior
Center. Later in the year, <PERSON>McMeekin</PERSON> caught Rust crocheting and
reading at the same time. When she commented on it, Rust said, ``I
can't waste any time.''
   Her 106th year brought her first ride on a motorcycle. Her
grandson took her on the ride around the trailer park where Rust
lives. Upon dismounting the motorcycle, Rust announced, ```There,
I've done one more thing I'd never done in my life,''' <PERSON>McMeekin</PERSON>
recalled.
   While Rust was 107 years old, she had a lens implant in her
right eye, which improved her vision so she could continue
crocheting granny squares. During the 2{ years that ended <DATE>June
1989</DATE>, Rust crocheted nearly 1,900 granny squares.
   During the past year, a book titled ``One Hundred over 100,''
was published and included an article about Rust. The author, <PERSON>Jim
Heynen</PERSON>, interviewed Rust when she was 106 years old.
   In the interview, she and <PERSON>Heynen</PERSON> played Scrabble and Rust won by
about 20 points. In the book, <PERSON>Heynen</PERSON> describes her as the kind of
person who will hoard the ``U'' letter squares when she knows her
opponent has the ``Q.''
   Scrabble, Anagrams and Aggravation have long been Rust's
favorite games. She also enjoys word puzzles and reading.
   Her hearing has deteriorated in the last few years, so she
doesn't visit with people as much as she used to. In past years,
<PERSON>McMeekin</PERSON> said Rust and her oldest daughter would reminisce for
hours.
   Rust was born <DATE>June 18, 1881</DATE>, in a sod house in <LOCATION>Hainesville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Neb</LOCATION>.
She and her husband were married in <LOCATION>Butte</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Neb.</LOCATION>, and they had 12
children. All but one are still living.
   Daughter <PERSON>Emma Nelson</PERSON>, of <LOCATION>Norfolk</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Neb.</LOCATION>, died in <DATE>1989</DATE> at age 77.
The other children range from age 87 to 65.
   Rust has 211 descendants. Besides her children, there are 36
grandchildren, 86 great-grandchildren, 74 great-great-grandchildren
and four great-great-great-grandchildren.

<HEAD>Toymaker Files for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Protection</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: combines pvs, edits throughout, restores dropped word,
``million'' in 6th graf.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WEST HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   <ORGANIZATION>Coleco Industries Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, which soared
to the top of the toy industry in the mid-1980s with its Cabbage
Patch Kids and then skidded into debt as the dolls' popularity
waned, announced today it filed for protection from its creditors
under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy law.
   <ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION> said the filing, which did not include its Canadian and
other foreign subsidiaries, was made <DATE>Monday</DATE> evening in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
Bankruptcy Court for the <ORGANIZATION>Southern District of New York</ORGANIZATION>.
   The toymaker said the filing followed the refusal of its
short-term bank lenders to agree to provide the company with an
adequate working capital credit line.
   <ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION> also announced that <PERSON>Morton E. Handel</PERSON>, who is recovering
from recent open-heart surgery, has submitted his resignation as
chief executive officer, citing the company's need for a full-time
CEO during this period. He will continue as chairman of the company.
   The board of directors appointed <PERSON>J. Brian Clarke</PERSON>, currently
president and chief operating officer, as president and chief
executive officer.
   The bankruptcy filing had been expected after <ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION> was unable
to persuade its bondholders to agree to a <MONEY>$335 million</MONEY> debt
restructuring. The company lost <MONEY>$47.4 million</MONEY> in the <DATE>quarter that
ended April 2</DATE> and has suffered losses in four of the past five
years, including <MONEY>$215</MONEY> over the <DATE>last two years</DATE>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION> owes more than <MONEY>$100 million</MONEY> to a group of foreign and
domestic lenders.
   In recent weeks, the company has tried to raise cash by selling
off some of its product lines. On <DATE>Monday</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, the nation's
largest toymaker, said it had agreed to purchase some of <ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION>'s
assets and lines for <MONEY>$21 million</MONEY>, including the plastic wading and
splashing pools and children's outdoor furniture lines.
   Those lines, which helped launched <ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION> in the toy business in
<DATE>1956</DATE>, had sales last year of <MONEY>$77 million</MONEY>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION> also has slashed its work force in an effort to cut
costs. It currently has fewer than 600 employees in the <LOCATION>United
States</LOCATION>, down from an average of 2,500 last year.
   Besides Cabbage Patch Kids, <ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION> manufactures Alf dolls, Big
Wheels plastic tricycles and board games, such as <ORGANIZATION>Scrabble</ORGANIZATION>.
Industry sources say the company holds about <PERCENT>5 percent</PERCENT> of the
nation's toy market.
   Analysts said the same aggressive management style that helped
<ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION> hit the jackpot with the gamble on <ORGANIZATION>Cabbage Patch Kids</ORGANIZATION> in
<DATE>1983</DATE> helped bring on its troubles.
   The dolls, introduced in <DATE>1983</DATE> after a number of other toy
companies rejected the product, helped <ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION> end <DATE>1985</DATE> in its
strongest financial condition ever, with sales of <MONEY>$776 million</MONEY> and
record earnings of <MONEY>$64 million</MONEY>.
   But the Cabbage Patch fad abated and analysts said the company
did not pare its costs soon enough. When the toy industry suffered
a slump in <DATE>1987</DATE>, the company was hit particularly hard.
   <ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION> has faced tough times before. It entered the snowmobile
business in <DATE>1972</DATE>, but snowfalls were light for the next three
years, the economy was depressed and losses were heavy.
   The company posted a <MONEY>$22 million</MONEY> loss in <DATE>1978</DATE>, threatening its
survival. In <DATE>1980</DATE> the <ORGANIZATION>Securities and Exchange Commission</ORGANIZATION> charged
<ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION> with misstating its financial results to mask troubles.
   In <DATE>1982</DATE> the company began a move toward prosperity with the
introduction of its ColecoVision home video game system. The
company saw its future in electronics, and in <DATE>1983</DATE> unveiled its
<MONEY>$600</MONEY> Adam home computer.
   Adam was a monumental flop, while sales of ColecoVision cooled.
The company lost <MONEY>$79.8 million</MONEY> in <DATE>1984</DATE> despite <MONEY>$540 million</MONEY> in
sales of Cabbage Patch Kids.

<HEAD>Bankruptcy Judge Approves Sale of Coleco to Hasbro</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal bankruptcy judge has approved the sale
of financially troubled <ORGANIZATION>Coleco Industries Inc.</ORGANIZATION>'s major product lines
to the nation's largest toymaker, <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro Inc</ORGANIZATION>.
   Under the terms of the deal, <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION> will pay <MONEY>$85 million</MONEY> in cash
for most of <ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION>'s products, including such widely known toys as
the Cabbage Patch Kids and the Scrabble and Parcheesi board games.
   Approval of the sale <DATE>Friday</DATE> signaled the end of the nearly
yearlong bankruptcy case of the Avon, Conn.-based toymaker.
   <PERSON>Judge Prudence B. Abram</PERSON>, who approved the sale, predicted that
the complex case, which has involved a frequently acrimonious battle
between creditors, could be wrapped up by the <DATE>fall</DATE>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION> filed for protection from its creditors under Chapter 11
of the Federal Bankruptcy Act on <DATE>July 11, 1988</DATE>, citing debts of
<MONEY>$540.3 million</MONEY>.
   <PERSON>Barry Alperin</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION>'s executive vice president, testified
<DATE>Friday</DATE> that the <LOCATION>Pawtucket</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>R.I.</LOCATION>, company wants to complete the
purchase by next week so it can begin advertising and producing the
<ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION> products before the Christmas sales season begins.
   Once the sale is completed, most of the remaining 80 employees at
<ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION>'s headquarters will be laid off in phases as the business is
closed and the court case completed, said <PERSON>J. Brian Clark</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION>'s
president and chief executive officer.
   After the sale, <ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION> will retain a few minor toy products, some
real estate and more than <MONEY>$135 million</MONEY> in cash _ the <MONEY>$85 million</MONEY>
from <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION> plus <MONEY>$50 million</MONEY> in the bank.
   <ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION> plans to sell its remaining products and real estate and
reorganize as a new company. Most of the new company's stock will be
owned by <ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION>'s creditors, with current stockholders owning a
minority interest.
   <ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION>'s largest creditors, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> businessmen <PERSON>Isaac Perlmutter</PERSON>
and <PERSON>Bernard Marden</PERSON>, will receive a total of <MONEY>$65 million</MONEY> of the cash
gained through the reorganization.
   The payment is <MONEY>$26 million</MONEY> less than the total owed to them, but
the two agreed to the reduced amount to settle a lawsuit filed
against them by the unsecured creditors' committee in the bankruptcy
case.
   The committee's suit charged that <PERSON>Perlmutter</PERSON> and <PERSON>Marden</PERSON> cheated
<ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION> out of <MONEY>$71 million</MONEY> through separate business dealings with
the company from <DATE>1986</DATE> to <DATE>1988</DATE>.
   When <ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION> reorganizes, it will have to come up with a new name
because <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION> is buying the right to use the <ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION> name on toys.
   Handel joked during testimony <DATE>Thursday</DATE> that executives had
considered but rejected the name ``Toys Were Us.''

Do we need the sight of a great modern film-maker jumping out at us from
behind a camera and saying 'Boo]'? This in essence is the experience
provided by <ORGANIZATION>Martin Scorsese's Cape Fear</ORGANIZATION>. There are more gratuitous coups de
cinema per minute than there are quills per inch upon a fretful porcupine.
Remaking the <DATE>1962</DATE> hoodlum-at-large thriller that starred <PERSON>Gregory Peck</PERSON> and
<PERSON>Robert Mitchum</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Scorsese</ORGANIZATION> provides a lexicon of visual ingenuities. Jump
cuts, painted skies, zoom-in-track-outs, rearing crane shots (even in
intimate conversation scenes), colour mutating to monochrome . . . Yet that
is all the film sometimes seems like: a lexicon. One is reminded of <PERSON>Bruce
Willis</PERSON>'s breathless aside in The Last Boy Scout when he and his chum are
attacked by a loquaciously abusive baddie: 'Feels like we're being beaten up
by the inventor of Scrabble.'
Scorsese's game is Movie Scrabble. You win a double-quote-score for wryly
invoking the original <ORGANIZATION>Cape Fear</ORGANIZATION>, as when an ageing <PERSON>Peck</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mitchum</PERSON> stroll
into cameo roles as sleazy lawyer and Southern sheriff respectively. And you
win a triple-quote-score if, like <PERSON>Robert De Niro</PERSON> as the vengeful ex-convict
who pursues and psychologically torments the defence lawyer who failed him
(<PERSON>Nick Nolte</PERSON>) plus his wife (<PERSON>Jessica Lange</PERSON>) and nubile daughter (<PERSON>Juliette
Lewis</PERSON>), you can pay tribute to as many roles and actors as possible.
De Niro's <PERSON>Max Cady</PERSON> is one part <PERSON>Mitchum</PERSON> - more The Night Of The <PERSON>Hunter</PERSON> than
<LOCATION>Cape Fear</LOCATION> - to several large parts of <PERSON>Lionel Barrymore</PERSON> and GD <PERSON>Spradlin</PERSON>. With
his Hawaian shirt, airport sun-glasses and loony ebullience, he also
suggests <PERSON>Fred Flintstone</PERSON> on a works outing to <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>. (The nominal setting
is <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION> but the film was shot, and looks like it, around <LOCATION>Fort
Lauderdale</LOCATION>). The movie is fun, but is it art? Like any good game of Scrabble
it is at least for a while diverting. From the first image in the titles
sequence - the camera rising from primeval waters to cue jagged letters
against a riverswept background - <ORGANIZATION>Scorsese</ORGANIZATION> is determined to go Gothic.
Hammer-horror cloudscapes lower over <PERSON>Nolte</PERSON> and <PERSON>Lange</PERSON>'s handsome mansion;
deep-focus effects pay homage to Citizen <PERSON>Kane</PERSON>; and fairy-tale ghoulishness
is invoked in the queasy scene where De Niro, luring <PERSON>Miss Lewis</PERSON>'s pubescent
teenager to the school basement cum makeshift theatre, plays Big <LOCATION>Bad Wolf</LOCATION> to
her Red Riding Hood with a mock-up gingerbread cottage behind him. This duel
of innuendo between a shyly ripening girl and a slippery psychopath - we
have already seen him brutalise a woman and bite a chunk from her cheek -
has a quietly hypnotic power.
But typically of this cleverer-than-thou thriller <PERSON>Miss Lewis</PERSON>, unlike her
<DATE>1962</DATE> predecessor, is no innocent. Coming 30 years on to the same story
(based on <PERSON>John D MacDonald</PERSON>'s novel The Executioners), <PERSON>Scorsese</PERSON> and
screenwriter <PERSON>Wesley Strick</PERSON> feel they must muddy the Manichean waters of good
guys versus bad. But in doing so, they also muddy its dramatic clarity of
purpose.
Nolte and <PERSON>Lange</PERSON> are an overwritten problem couple with an over-telegraphed
problem daughter. He is a he-man repressed by small-town life, his small
eyes penned in behind wire-rim specs. She is a designer with a Lange-ian
line in tremulous hysteria.
They are clearly in such deep domestic turmoil already - with his
infidelities and her keening reproaches - that the arrival of <PERSON>Mr Madman</PERSON> from
the Slammer would seem a minor addition to their problems. Possibly even a
welcome diversion. As a result the violent finale aboard a drifting,
waveswept houseboat - where De Niro keeps bobbing back to life in the best
ghoul-can't-help-it tradition - has the frivolous excitement of a fairground
ride rather than the visceral horror of a face-to-face with death.
With no sense of emotional hazard there is no sense of suspense. Instead of
a horrified 'Ah no]' in response to scenes, we keep mouthing an admiring 'Ah
yes]' The director who crafted Taxi Driver, Raging Bull and GoodFellas is
here aided by a good cameraman (<PERSON>Freddie Francis</PERSON>) and a great production
designer (<PERSON>Henry Bumstead</PERSON> of Vertigo). But all that results is that the
tunnel-vision intensity the tale requires is ousted by decorative overkill.
This even extends to the star player. De Niro lolls across the CinemaScope
screen as if determined to colonise every inch of it. He snarls and croons
and teases; he savours his Southern accent like fine wine. He is a
vaudeville charmer in a vaudeville thriller. His only saving grace is that,
unlike everyone else in the film, he seems to know it is a deep dark joke
and not to be taken seriously as a spinechiller-turned-psychodrama.
Worse, far worse, is the Euro-comedy Once Upon A Crime. What a title. They
probably came up with it after rejecting Sweet Sistine and Abandon Pope for
this Rome-set plot about a murder, a valuable dachshund and six
second-magnitude stars hurtling about delivering dead dialogue. They include
<PERSON>Cybill Shepherd</PERSON>, <PERSON>James Belushi</PERSON>, <PERSON>Sean Young</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>John Candy</ORGANIZATION> and an
embarrassed-looking <PERSON>George Hamilton</PERSON> wearing boot polish as a tanned,
over-age toyboy.
Did I say <LOCATION>Rome</LOCATION>? Well, it begins there, then moves to <ORGANIZATION>Monte Carlo</ORGANIZATION>. But by
this stage the Press show audience was being examined by a doctor for signs
of rigor mortis. Startlingly, or perhaps not, three writers are credited
with having struggled over the script. The best dialogue exchange - 'Are you
finished?", 'No, I'm Swedish' - will give you a measure of the rest. <PERSON>Eugene
Levy</PERSON> directed.
Men Of Respect is Macbeth remade as a Mafia thriller. Dr <PERSON>Jonathan Miller</PERSON> is
to blame for all this. Dear me, the cultural cost of that Rigoletto. Here we
have <PERSON>Rod Steiger</PERSON> and <PERSON>Peter Boyle</PERSON> among the <ORGANIZATION>Cosa Nostra</ORGANIZATION> bigwigs, <PERSON>John 'Barton
Fink</PERSON>' <PERSON>Turturro</PERSON> as the modern Macbeth ('No man born of woman can do shit to
me') and <PERSON>Katherine Borowitz</PERSON> as a Mafiosa Lady M given to scouring the
bathroom with bleach. Meanwhile Banquo is called Banky, <ORGANIZATION>MacDuff Duffy</ORGANIZATION> and
<ORGANIZATION>Malcolm Mal</ORGANIZATION>. When they do Hamlet it will no doubt be Hammy, Ophie and <PERSON>Gert</PERSON>.
<PERSON>William Reilly</PERSON> wrote and directed.
Far better to visit the <ORGANIZATION>ICA</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>John Cassavetes</PERSON> season, running for one more
week. The wild man of American cinema, who died last year, made films that
were like the fearless, flailing revelations of a patient under truth serum.
He wrote his own stories - of marital break-up and nervous breakdown, of
high and low living on the Bohemian fringes - and had them improvised into
life by his handpicked repertory of actor-friends. <PERSON>Ben Gazzara</PERSON>, <PERSON>Peter Falk</PERSON>,
<PERSON>Gena Rowlands</PERSON>, himself: his favourite stars kept being recycled in plots
that were as untidy as <ORGANIZATION>Columbo</ORGANIZATION>'s mac and as challengingly, endearingly
human. Shadows, Faces, A Woman Under The Influence, The Killing Of A Chinese
Bookie. The best is here. Catch it while you can.

   Troubled <ORGANIZATION>Coleco Industries Inc.</ORGANIZATION> has agreed
to sell most of its assets to <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro Inc.</ORGANIZATION> for <MONEY>$85 million</MONEY> in cash, a
deal analysts said means the demise of the toymaker that introduced
the hottest-selling toy in <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> history, the Cabbage Patch doll.
   ``Coleco always stood for innovation and the ability to take
risks,'' said <PERSON>Paul Valentine</PERSON>, a toy analyst with <ORGANIZATION>New York-based
Standard &amp; Poor's Corp.</ORGANIZATION> ``The industry is poorer because of their
demise.''
   Under the agreement announced <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, Avon-based <ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION>, now
operating under <ORGANIZATION>Bankruptcy Court</ORGANIZATION> protection, also will receive
warrants to purchase 1 million shares of <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION> stock.
   <LOCATION>Pawtucket</LOCATION>, R.I.-based <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION>, the largest <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> toymaker, will
receive <ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION>'s product line, which includes the Scrabble and
Parcheesi board games as well as the Cabbage Patch dolls, <ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION>
Chairman <PERSON>Morton Handel</PERSON> said.
   In addition to buying inventory and the equipment to make the
products, <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION> will buy certain accounts receivable, <PERSON>Handel</PERSON> said.
   <ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION> will retain all of its cash assets and certain real estate
that it will convert to cash, <PERSON>Handel</PERSON> said. At the completion of the
transaction, <ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION> will have as much as <MONEY>$150 million</MONEY> in cash _ the
<MONEY>$85 million</MONEY> from <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION> and about <MONEY>$65 million</MONEY> <ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION> had in the
banks in mid-March, <ORGANIZATION>Handel</ORGANIZATION> said.
   The cash will be used to pay off the company's debt, he said.
When <ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION> filed for bankruptcy protection a year ago, it listed
debt of <MONEY>$540.3 million</MONEY>.
   The agreement still must be approved by the <ORGANIZATION>Bankruptcy Court</ORGANIZATION>,
<PERSON>Handel</PERSON> said. The deal is also subject to the approval of <ORGANIZATION>Original
Appalachian Artworks Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, creator of Cabbage Patch Kids, and <ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION>
directors.
   If the deal is approved, most of <ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION>'s remaining 250 employees
are expected to be laid off, although some may be hired by <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION>,
<PERSON>Handel</PERSON> said.
   ``<ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION> was pretty much the victim of its own success,'' said
<PERSON>David Leibowitz</PERSON>, senior vice president of <ORGANIZATION>New York-based American
Securities Corp.</ORGANIZATION> ``Cabbage Patch in <DATE>1985</DATE> was the largest single
selling toy of all time, selling <MONEY>$600 million-plus</MONEY> at wholesale.''
   The success of the homely Cabbage Patch dolls forced <ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION> to
expand, borrowing money to do so, he said. When Cabbage Patch Kids
sales tumbled and new products _ including the Adam home computer
and toys based on Rambo movies _ did not sell, the company could not
pay off the new debts, he said.
   Valentine said <PERSON>Arnold Greenberg</PERSON>, the former <ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION> chairman,
managed the company too aggressively without focusing on cost
controls.
   ``They managed their company for a sales revival that never
came,'' <PERSON>Valentine</PERSON> said. But, he added, it was <PERSON>Greenberg</PERSON> who
transformed <ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION> into a major company.
   <PERSON>Greenberg</PERSON>'s Russian immigrant father, <PERSON>Maurice Greenberg</PERSON>, founded
the company as the <ORGANIZATION>Connecticut Leather Co.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Hartford</LOCATION> in <DATE>1932</DATE>,
selling leather and shoe heels and soles. The company expanded into
toys in <DATE>1954</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Arnold Greenberg</PERSON> joined <ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION> full time in <DATE>1966</DATE>. He bought the
license to the Cabbage Patch Kids in <DATE>1982</DATE> after several major toy
companies turned down the dolls, which were designed with their own
set of adoption papers.
   For growing <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION>, which in the <DATE>last decade</DATE> has bought such
big-name toymakers as <ORGANIZATION>Milton Bradley Co.</ORGANIZATION> and introduced a steady
stream of new products, the deal means yet another line of toys.
   <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION>, which makes GI <PERSON>Joe</PERSON>, <PERSON>Mr. Potato Head</PERSON>, My Little Pony and
the <ORGANIZATION>Transformers</ORGANIZATION>, had sales of <MONEY>$1.34 billion</MONEY> last year, up from just
<MONEY>$104.3 million</MONEY> in <DATE>1980</DATE>.
   ``Under <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION>, I think Cabbage Patch will grow substantially
over the next few years,'' <PERSON>Valentine</PERSON> said. ``Even Barbie has her ups
and downs. The Cabbage Patch Kids won't wilt forever.''

   LEISURE &amp; ARTS:
   Mad for Mah-Jongg
   ----
   By Susan G. Hauser

WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A12

<LP>
   Portland, Ore. -- Mah-jongg is all the rage in this neck
of the woods. I had to wait three whole months to get into
one of the local how-to classes, which are churning out
mah-jongg foursomes faster than you can say, "One bam West]"
   By all accounts, the last time this happened was about 70
years ago. A 1924 article in the Oregonian stated that
mah-jongg mania was spreading like a contagion: "Matrons and
flappers have fallen for its wiles, and fallen hard."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A lot has changed in 70 years, and today's players can
fall for any number of mah-jongg variations, including
Chinese, Japanese, Filipino, Jewish and Wright-Patterson.
   Me, I learned the Jewish version -- also known as American
or international -- mah-jongg. Its rules are Greek to my
friend <PERSON>Carol</PERSON>, who is Chinese. As for my friend Rod, he plays
by Wright-Patterson rules, which originated in the <DATE>1920s</DATE> at
an <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> base of that name near <LOCATION>Dayton</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>.
   Unfortunately, as things stand we can't play together.
About all we can recognize from one game to another are the
decorated tiles and the various suits. But the number of
tiles used for each version and the names for them differ.
Rod says "character," I say "crak," <PERSON>Carol</PERSON> says "wan."
Likewise, "bamboo," "bam" and "tiao" are different words for
the same thing.
   At a glance, mah-jongg resembles a cross between gin rummy
and <ORGANIZATION>Scrabble</ORGANIZATION>. The playing pieces are plastic tiles,
originally made from bone or ivory with bamboo backs.
Everybody draws tiles in turn and sets them up on racks. Out
of the view of the other players, they attempt to create a
particular combination of the numbers or images shown on the
tiles.
   The first player to compile a winning hand cries,
"Mah-jongg]" and the game ends. Depending on the type of
game, the winner then can collect praise (my teacher taught
us to applaud and exclaim, "Mah jel tov]"), points or money.
   Nobody seems to know why people are brushing off their
dusty sets of mah-jongg tiles and going at it again after all
these years, but I suspect it has something to do with the
popularity of <PERSON>Amy Tan</PERSON>'s book "The Joy Luck Club," in which
the people play mah-jongg (Chinese version), and the film
"Driving Miss Daisy," in which Miss Daisy plays mah-jongg
(Jewish version).
   Mah-jongg mavens of all stripes say there is more interest
in the game than ever. <PERSON>Helen Kelly</PERSON>, president of the
<ORGANIZATION>Officers' Wives Club</ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION>Wright-Patterson Air Force Base</ORGANIZATION>, told
me orders for their rule books are coming in from air bases
and embassies around the world. This pleases <PERSON>Mrs. Kelly</PERSON>, who
can always find a foursome wherever her husband is stationed.
   <PERSON>Ruth Unger</PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION>National Mah Jongg League</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION>, which was founded in <DATE>1937</DATE>, says the league's
world-wide membership is 150,000 and climbing. For members,
the high point of each year is the mah-jongg cruise, which
finds hundreds of women sailing around some exotic locale
(this year it's <LOCATION>Acapulco</LOCATION>) that they never notice.
   "Many of the ladies don't get off the ship when we hit
port," said <PERSON>Mrs. Unger</PERSON>. "Or they don't go to sleep. They just
sit and play."
   <PERSON>Mrs. Kelly</PERSON> liked the idea of a cruise, but, loyal <ORGANIZATION>Air
Force</ORGANIZATION> wife that she is, suggested that Wright-Patterson
players could board a plane instead, then circle the globe
for the time it takes them to play their fill.
   <PERSON>Mrs. Unger</PERSON> said she has never played by Wright-Patterson
rules, even though the league supplies the air base with
mah-jongg sets. But <PERSON>Mrs. Kelly</PERSON> said she once tried
international mah-jongg.
   "It was foreign to me but I played because I wanted to
play mah-jongg," she said. "Any port in a storm, you know."
   Both women made it clear that with mah-jongg, when you
gotta play, you gotta play. They said the game is like no
other in that real bonding occurs during mah-jongg. There is
no such thing as, say, canasta bonding.
   "I don't know if it's the magic of the tiles or what,"
said <PERSON>Mrs. Unger</PERSON>. "But mah-jongg is special. It's really more
than a game, I'd say."
   Some mah-jongg enthusiasts love the game so much that they
wax poetic. Here is a sampling from <PERSON>Mrs. Unger</PERSON>'s mailbag: "I
love playing mah-jongg/I love it a lot./ But my head is just
spinning/With crak, bam and dot.
   Another mah-jongg bard's heart was in the right place,
though her meter wasn't: "Our friendship started with one
bam,/ Two dot and a <LOCATION>West</LOCATION>./But has grown close over the
year/And is absolutely the best."
   I hate to put a damper on this love fest, but in my
conversations with mah-jongg enthusiasts around town, I did
detect a tinge of rivalry between the various loyalists. Some
say their version of mah-jongg requires more brain power than
the others.
   Brains? No one said anything about brains in my class. In
fact, my teacher said, and I quote:
   "There's one thing you have to have in order to have a
successful game. You have to have nosh."
   You know, good food. Good food, good friends, good tiles.
What more could you ask? Mah-jongg forever]

<TEXT>
   <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro Inc.</ORGANIZATION> officials declined comment
<DATE>Tuesday</DATE> on published reports that <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION>, the world's biggest
toymaker, would buy most of <ORGANIZATION>Coleco Industries Inc.</ORGANIZATION> under a plan to
be presented in bankruptcy court.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Hartford Courant</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> that sources close to
Avon-based <ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION>'s 10-month-old bankruptcy case told the newspaper
that details of the plan still were being negotiated.
   <PERSON>Barry Alperin</PERSON>, executive vice president of <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, declined
to comment on the report, saying the companies were forbidden from
discussing the case in public by an order last month from <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
Bankruptcy Court in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>.
   A secretary for <ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION>'s chairman, <PERSON>Morton Handel</PERSON>, said he would
be away from his office all day. She declined to say where he could
be contacted.
   Representatives of <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION>'s creditors are
scheduled to appear <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> in bankruptcy court in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> to
discuss the plan.
   The deal expected to be announced <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> would strengthen
<ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION>'s position in the toy business by adding such well-known
<ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION> items as Cabbage Patch Kids and Scrabble and Parcheesi board
games to its product lines.
   While many details are unknown, sources told The Courant that
the deal would provide that:
   _Much of <ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION> would be sold to <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION>, but it could not be
determined whether <LOCATION>Pawtucket</LOCATION>, R.I.-based company would buy all of
<ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION> or just most of its assets. If <ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION> is sold, it would end
57 years as an independent company.
   _<ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION>'s committee of unsecured creditors would drop its <MONEY>$71
million</MONEY> lawsuit against the company's largest creditors, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>
businessmen <PERSON>Isaac Perlmutter</PERSON> and <PERSON>Bernard Marden</PERSON>.
   _<PERSON>Perlmutter</PERSON> and <PERSON>Marden</PERSON>, in turn, would reduce their <MONEY>$80 million</MONEY>
claim against <ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION> by an undetermined amount.
   The lawsuit contends that <PERSON>Perlmutter</PERSON> and <PERSON>Marden</PERSON>, who are secured
creditors, cheated <ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION> out of <MONEY>millions of dollars</MONEY> through a
complex scheme of trading television advertising time for products.
   The deal would be a victory for <ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION>'s unsecured creditors,
because a reduced claim by <PERSON>Perlmutter</PERSON> and <PERSON>Marden</PERSON> means more money
would be available to repay them, the newspaper said. <ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION> had
debts of <MONEY>$540.3 million</MONEY> when it filed for protection from its
creditors under the bankruptcy laws in <DATE>July</DATE>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION> grew to be one of the nation's largest toy companies
during the past decade, propelled in large part by its Cabbage
Patch Kids dolls.
   But demand for the dolls dropped beginning in <DATE>1986</DATE> and <ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION>
was not successful at introducing new products to make up for the
lost sales. The company sought Bankruptcy Court protection last
year.
   <ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION> filed its first reorganization plan in late <DATE>January</DATE>,
detailing how it planned to repay creditors. But that proposal
immediately was rejected by the creditors' committee, which said it
provided inadequate payment and appeared to favor <PERSON>Perlmutter</PERSON> and
<PERSON>Marden</PERSON>'s interests over the committee's.
   The plan would have given <PERSON>Perlmutter</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Marden</ORGANIZATION> <PERCENT>55 percent</PERCENT> of
the stock of a reorganized <ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION> and a note for <MONEY>$40 million</MONEY> in
cash. Creditors would have received about <PERCENT>36 percent</PERCENT> of <ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION>
stock and no cash, a plan they valued at about <MONEY>5 cents</MONEY> for every <MONEY>$1</MONEY>
they are owed.
   In <DATE>March</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION> said it was considering selling the company
outright to resolve its financial problems.
   A few weeks later, however, the company reversed itself and said
it would instead propose a new reorganization plan offering a

   <ORGANIZATION>Coleco Industries Inc.</ORGANIZATION> creditors say they have
agreed to settle lawsuits stemming from the troubled toymaker's
11-month bankruptcy case.
   The settlement, announced <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> during a hearing in <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
Bankruptcy Court, must be approved by the court.
   Meanwhile, no details were released about a proposal by <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro
Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest toy manufacturer, to purchase most of
<ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION>. But <PERSON>Daniel Golden</PERSON>, an attorney for <ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION>, said
negotiations concerning the sale of most <ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION> assets continued.
   <PERSON>Richard Tilton</PERSON>, a lawyer for <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION>, said he expected a joint
statement on the proposed sale would be issued next week. He
declined to discuss details of the plan, saying it still was
``subject to a number of conditions that need to be discussed.''
   The creditors' settlement announced <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> calls for <ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION>'s
largest creditors, <PERSON>Isaac Perlmutter</PERSON> and <PERSON>Bernard Marden</PERSON>, to receive
<MONEY>$61 million</MONEY> of their <MONEY>$87 million</MONEY> claim against <ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION>.
   Unsecured creditors of the company based in <LOCATION>Avon</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Conn.</LOCATION>, would
drop their <MONEY>$71 million</MONEY> lawsuit against <PERSON>Perlmutter</PERSON> and <PERSON>Marden</PERSON>, under
the settlement.
   The unsecured creditors had claimed that <PERSON>Perlmutter</PERSON> and <PERSON>Marden</PERSON>,
secured creditors, cheated <ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION> out of <MONEY>millions of dollars</MONEY>
through a complex scheme of trading television advertising time for
products.
   <PERSON>Tilton</PERSON> said the settlement would mean that <PERSON>Perlmutter</PERSON> could not
finance <ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION>'s reorganization plan as originally intended. But
<PERSON>Tilton</PERSON> said alternative sources of funding could be found. He did
not elaborate.
   <ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION>, which grew to be one of the nation's largest toymakers
during the past decade, suffered a change in fortune in <DATE>1986</DATE>, when
demand for its Cabbage Patch dolls dropped.
   New lines introduced by the company failed to make up for lost
sales, and <ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION> sought Bankruptcy Court protection last <DATE>July</DATE>,
citing debts of <MONEY>$540.3 million</MONEY>.
   A first reorganization plan filed by <ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>January</DATE> was
rejected immediately by the creditors' committee.
   The plan would have given <PERSON>Perlmutter</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Marden</ORGANIZATION> <PERCENT>55 percent</PERCENT> of
the stock of a reorganized <ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION> and a note for <MONEY>$40 million</MONEY> in
cash. Creditors would have received about <PERCENT>36 percent</PERCENT> of <ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION>
stock and no cash, a plan they valued at about <MONEY>5 cents</MONEY> for every <MONEY>$1</MONEY>
they are owed.
   In <DATE>March</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION> said it was considering a sale of the company,
but reversed itself a few weeks later, filing a new reorganization
plan it hoped would satisfy creditors.
   The new plan offered a larger repayment, including about <MONEY>10
cents</MONEY> for every <MONEY>$1</MONEY> of debt, plus <PERCENT>37 percent</PERCENT> of <ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION>'s stock.
   On <DATE>April 19</DATE>, before the second plan was filed with the
<ORGANIZATION>Bankruptcy Court</ORGANIZATION>, creditors announced they had negotiated a deal to
sell most of <ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION> to <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION> for more than <MONEY>$85 million</MONEY> in cash.
   The deal would add well-known <ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION> items such as the Cabbage
Patch Kids and Scrabble and Parcheesi board games to <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION>'s
product lines, it has been reported.
   <ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION> officials, upset by the <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION> proposal, asked <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
Bankruptcy <PERSON>Judge Prudence B. Abram</PERSON> on <DATE>April 20</DATE> to issue a
restraining order prohibiting creditors from pursuing the plan with
<ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION>.
   Instead, <PERSON>Abram</PERSON> urged the two sides to strike a compromise.

<HEAD>Toymaker Files for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Protection</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto, LaserGraphic</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new management team is in place
today at <ORGANIZATION>Coleco Industries Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, and the company that brought
Cabbage Patch Kids to the marketplace is seeking protection from
its creditors in bankruptcy court.
   The West Hartford-based company on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> gave up a months-long
battle to reach an agreement to reorganize its debts with its banks
and bondholders, announcing it had filed for federal bankruptcy
court protection from creditors.
   <ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION> said it filed for Chapter 11 protection late <DATE>Monday</DATE> with
<ORGANIZATION>U.S. Bankruptcy Court</ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION>Southern District of New York</ORGANIZATION>. The
filing will permit the company to continue operating while it
reorganizes its finances.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION> board appointed <PERSON>J. Brian Clarke</PERSON>, currently president
and chief operating officer, as president and chief executive
officer.
   Clarke replaces <PERSON>Morton E. Handel</PERSON>, who is recovering from
open-heart surgery. Handel submitted his resignation as chief
executive officer because of the company's need for a full-time CEO
during this period. He will continue as chairman of the board.
   The Chapter 11 filing had been expected ever since <ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION>
announced in <DATE>March</DATE> it suffered a <MONEY>$105.4 million</MONEY> loss for all of
<DATE>1987</DATE> and would miss an <DATE>April</DATE> interest payment on its debentures.
<ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION> said the filing did not include the company's Canadian and
other foreign subsidiaries.
   Telephone calls seeking comment from company officials on
<DATE>Tuesday</DATE> were not returned.
   <ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION> owes more than <MONEY>$100 million</MONEY> to a group of foreign and
domestic lenders. In <DATE>March</DATE>, shortly after it announced a <MONEY>$47.4
million</MONEY> loss for the <DATE>first quarter</DATE>, the toymaker proposed a <MONEY>$335
million</MONEY> debt restructuring plan.
   But late last month, <ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION> was forced to abandon the plan
because it failed to win approval of the company's debtholders. The
company said <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> it was no longer able to obtain working
capital financing because of the failed plan and because some
creditors had started to attach its assets.
   Over the past year, the toymaker slashed its work force in an
effort to cut costs. It currently has fewer than 600 employees in
the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, down from an average of 2,500 last year.
   It also has sold several of its product lines to raise cash.
   ``What is going to emerge is going will be very different from
what went in,'' said analyst <PERSON>David Leibowitz</PERSON>, senior vice president
of <ORGANIZATION>American Securities Corp</ORGANIZATION>.
   Five years ago, <ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION> was on top of the toy world with its
Cabbage Patch Kids. The company sold <MONEY>$1 billion</MONEY> worth of the dolls
over two years.
   The Cabbage Patch craze prompted <ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION> to expand its product
lines and make acquisitions. <ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION> bought the company that makes
Scrabble board games, acquired the license to the popular Trivial
Pursuit board game and bought the company that makes Wrinkles
stuffed animals.
   But the Cabbage Patch fad abated and analysts said the company
did not pare its costs soon enough. When the toy industry slumped
in <DATE>1987</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION> was hit particularly hard.
   The company suffered losses in four of the past five years,
including <MONEY>$215 million</MONEY> over the <DATE>last two years</DATE>.
   It recently lost the license to market Trivial Pursuit because
of its precarious financial state.
   But <ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> it managed to retain the license for the
valuable Cabbage Patch line. <ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION> said it had extended its
license with <ORGANIZATION>Original Appalachian Artworks Inc.</ORGANIZATION> until <DATE>Dec. 31, 1994</DATE>.

   PAWTUCKET, R.I. -- Hasbro Inc. said net income rose 61% in
the fourth quarter, reflecting a 54% increase in revenue
buoyed by healthy Christmas sales and contributions from its
acquisition last year of Tonka Corp.
   Hasbro, the nation's largest toy and game maker, posted
net of $44.8 million, or 76 cents a share, compared with
$27.9 million, or 49 cents a share, a year earlier.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Fourth-quarter revenue of <MONEY>$761.2 million</MONEY>, up from <MONEY>$492.8
million</MONEY> in the <DATE>1990 fourth quarter</DATE>, included <MONEY>$202 million</MONEY>
from <ORGANIZATION>Tonka</ORGANIZATION>; excluding <ORGANIZATION>Tonka</ORGANIZATION>, revenue still grew a healthy
<PERCENT>13%</PERCENT>.
   "Hasbro finished up for the year in strong fashion, and
its results are right in line with expectations," said
analyst <PERSON>Gary M. Jacobson</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co</ORGANIZATION>. He pointed
out that the company's earnings were depressed in the <DATE>1990
fourth quarter</DATE> because of write-offs from several toy
retailers -- including <ORGANIZATION>Child World Inc.</ORGANIZATION> -- that were having
difficulties.
   "The integration of {<ORGANIZATION>Tonka</ORGANIZATION>} operations is now
substantially complete, and we expect they will be a positive
contributing factor to the combined operations in <DATE>1992</DATE>," said
<PERSON>Alan G. Hassenfeld</PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer.
   <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION> was helped by the Christmas sales successes of
Go-Go My Walking Pup, <ORGANIZATION>Scrabble</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Electronic Hotshot Basketball</ORGANIZATION>
and the revitalized G.I. <PERSON>Joe</PERSON> line.
   Net for the year was <MONEY>$81.7 million</MONEY>, or <MONEY>$1.41</MONEY> a share, on
revenue of <MONEY>$2.14 billion</MONEY> after a pretax restructuring charge
of <MONEY>$59 million</MONEY> recorded in the <DATE>second quarter</DATE> for the <ORGANIZATION>Tonka</ORGANIZATION>
purchase. In <DATE>1990</DATE>, the company had net of <MONEY>$89.2 million</MONEY>, or
<MONEY>$1.54</MONEY> a share, on revenue of <MONEY>$1.52 billion</MONEY>.
   The company's growth is increasingly coming from its
international business, which now accounts for about <PERCENT>40%</PERCENT> of
revenue. While domestic revenue rose about <PERCENT>40%</PERCENT> in the <DATE>fourth
quarter</DATE> from a year earlier, international revenue was about
<PERCENT>70%</PERCENT> higher, said <PERSON>John O'Neill</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION>'s chief financial
officer.

   <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro Inc.</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> it had
completed the purchase of most of the product lines of financially
troubled <ORGANIZATION>Coleco Industries Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, and would immediately begin
producing the popular Cabbage Patch Kids dolls.
   <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest toymaker, agreed last week to
purchase <ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION>'s major assets for <MONEY>$85 million</MONEY> cash and an option
for <ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION> to purchase 1 million shares of Pawtucket-based <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION> at
<MONEY>$28.85</MONEY> each after its bankruptcy reorganization plan was confirmed,
said <PERSON>Barry Alperin</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION>'s executive vice president.
   Conneticut-based <ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION> filed for protection from its creditors
under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy act a year ago, citing
debts of <MONEY>$540.3 million</MONEY>.
   Hasbro stock closed at <MONEY>$20</MONEY> <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> on the <ORGANIZATION>American Stock
Exchange</ORGANIZATION>, down <MONEY>25 cents</MONEY> a share.
   <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION> said it had reached agreement with <ORGANIZATION>Appalachian Artworks
Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, creator of <ORGANIZATION>Cabbage Patch Kids</ORGANIZATION>, to begin manufacturing the
dolls immediately, in time to advertise them for <DATE>Christmas</DATE>.
   The dolls would be made overseas and packaged at <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Milton
Bradley</PERSON> division in <LOCATION>East Longmeadow</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Alperin</PERSON> said. Most of
<ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION>'s other lines, including the Scrabble and Parcheesi games
also would be produced in <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION>, which also bought the right to use <ORGANIZATION>Coleco</ORGANIZATION>'s name, would
discontinue some of its products, including Alf and Wrinkles,
<PERSON>Alperin</PERSON> said.
   Chairman <PERSON>Alan G. Hassenfeld</PERSON> said the acquisition would add ``some
time-tested products which will enrich <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION>'s three divisions
without material additions to our cost structure.''
   <ORGANIZATION>Hasbro</ORGANIZATION>'s third division is Playskool.
   <PERSON>Alperin</PERSON> said the Cabbage Patch line, which was the largest
selling toy of all time in <DATE>1985</DATE>, ``has not had the attention it
deserved over the past couple of years.''
   Sales of Cabbage Patch peaked at more than <MONEY>$600 million</MONEY> in <DATE>1985</DATE>
but slipped to <MONEY>$58 million</MONEY> by last year.

   <PERSON>Terry Anderson</PERSON>, the longest held of the 16
Western hostages, helped fellow prisoners make Scrabble and
Monopoly games to amuse themselves, according to a newly freed
captive.
   His guards are giving him and other hostages plenty of
diversions, according to an account given by former hostage <PERSON>Frank
Reed</PERSON> to <PERSON>Anderson</PERSON>'s sister, <PERSON>Peggy Say</PERSON>.
   ``They have a lot of things which was encouraging to me; at
least they did at the time <PERSON>Frank</PERSON> was there,'' <PERSON>Mrs. Say</PERSON> said. These
included boxes of books, writing materials and dominoes.
   Although <PERSON>Anderson</PERSON>, 42, the chief <LOCATION>Middle East</LOCATION> correspondent for
<ORGANIZATION>The Associated Press</ORGANIZATION>, is in good physical condition from plenty of
exercise, he is tired and needs dental care, <PERSON>Mrs. Say</PERSON> said. She
said the hostages are blindfolded and chained in line with their
preference.
   ``Frank preferred a chain on his wrist,'' she said. ``<PERSON>Terry</PERSON>
preferred a chain on his ankle so that his arms are free to write
and play cards.''
   The closest she and <ORGANIZATION>Reed</ORGANIZATION> were able to calculate that he last saw
<PERSON>Anderson</PERSON> was somewhere between <DATE>a year and 18 months ago</DATE>. Reed spent
20 months with <PERSON>Anderson</PERSON> and <PERSON>Thomas Sutherland</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Lebanon</LOCATION>. For a
period of time, the three American hostages were together with two
others, <PERSON>John McCarthy</PERSON> and <PERSON>Brian Keenan</PERSON>.
   Reed, the director of the private <ORGANIZATION>Lebanon International School</ORGANIZATION>,
was freed <DATE>April 30</DATE> after being held for 44 months. He is undergoing
medical checkups at <ORGANIZATION>Andrews Air Force Base</ORGANIZATION> in suburban <LOCATION>Maryland</LOCATION> and
met with <PERSON>Mrs.</PERSON> <DATE>Say Monday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>.
   Anderson is in his sixth year of captivity. <PERSON>Sutherland</PERSON> was a
dean at the <ORGANIZATION>American University of Beirut</ORGANIZATION>. McCarthy is a British
television journalist. <PERSON>Keenan</PERSON>, who is Irish, taught English at
<ORGANIZATION>American University</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``He is still a vindictive hearts player,'' <PERSON>Mrs. Say</PERSON> said of her
brother. Reed told her <PERSON>Anderson</PERSON> also reads voraciously, a book a
day.
   <ORGANIZATION>Reed</ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON>Anderson</PERSON> could pick up some things in Arabic from the
radio and have at least some idea of what he thought was going on
in the world. But his guards have made a concerted effort to keep
from him news of the deaths of his father and brother, both from
cancer, within four months of each other in <DATE>1986</DATE>. <PERSON>Mrs. Say</PERSON> said she
believes that he still does not know.
   ``That's very difficult,'' she said. ``Part of you wants him to
have known and dealt with it and part of you believes it might be
too much for him if he found out in captivity.''
   But with his mind still sharp, he thinks of new birthdays
painfully uncelebrated for the two daughters he cares for so deeply.
   He is wracked with anguish at missing more than five years with
them, unable to savor the passage of Gabrielle from child to woman.
In <PERSON>Anderson</PERSON>'s sixth year of captivity, <PERSON>Gabrielle</PERSON> turned 14 on <DATE>April
26</DATE>.
   He has never held <PERSON>Sulome</PERSON>, who was born three months after he was
kidnapped in Moslem west <LOCATION>Beirut</LOCATION> on <DATE>March 16, 1985</DATE>, by <ORGANIZATION>Islamic
Jihad</ORGANIZATION>, a group loyal to <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION>. She will be 5 on <DATE>June 7</DATE>.
   ``He was very verbal about his love of them and that was what he
wanted when he got out, to see his daughters,'' <PERSON>Mrs. Say</PERSON> said.
   Unlike <PERSON>Reed</PERSON>, who said he was brutally beaten by his kidnappers
for trying to escape twice, <PERSON>Anderson</PERSON> was left alone. <PERSON>Mrs. Say</PERSON> said
<PERSON>Reed</PERSON> told her <PERSON>Anderson</PERSON> was not beaten.
   Reed told <PERSON>Mrs. Say</PERSON> that her brother was aware of her tireless
campaign to free him and the other hostages.
   <PERSON>Mrs. Say</PERSON>, 49, shuttles between <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> and her home in
<LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION>. She has made several trips to the <LOCATION>Middle East</LOCATION> seeking his
release. She has met with President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>, Pope <PERSON>John Paul II</PERSON>, the
archbishop of <ORGANIZATION>Canterbury</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>PLO</ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON>Yasser Arafat</PERSON>. She fields
phone calls all hours of the day and night.
   ``The guards told him (<PERSON>Anderson</PERSON>) everytime I did something of
major import,'' <PERSON>Mrs. Say</PERSON> said. ``Because it has been a criticism
that I've heard, I said to him (Reed), `Does Terry think what I'm
doing is making him be held longer?' And he said, `Absolutely not.
That only gives him hope.'''
