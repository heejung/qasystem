   A battered 3-year-old being used as a
panhandling prop died just after a concerned passerby sent her to a
hospital, the second death in two weeks of a toddler who lived at
the city's largest welfare hotel, police said <DATE>Friday</DATE>.
   The girl's mother's boyfriend was charged with murder.
   <PERSON>Maya Figueroa</PERSON> had ``bruises and contusions on her face, back and
neck. Some of these bruises appeared to be recent,'' police Capt.
<PERSON>Michael Gardner</PERSON> said at a news conference.
   Police questioned the girl's mother, <PERSON>Elise Vasquez</PERSON>, 32, who was
in <ORGANIZATION>Bellevue Hospital</ORGANIZATION> after giving birth <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> to her fifth
child.
   The girl was pronounced dead <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>evening</TIME>, 20 minutes after
she arrived at <ORGANIZATION>New York University Medical Center</ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON>Aaron
Rosenthal</PERSON>, assistant chief of <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION> detectives.
   An autopsy <DATE>Friday</DATE> indicated the toddler died of blunt force
injuries of head and abdomen with internal injuries and bleeding,
said <PERSON>Ellen Borakove</PERSON> of the city medical examiner's office. The case
was officially ruled child abuse and a homicide, she said.
   The girl had been sent to the hospital by a man who saw her on a
street corner with <PERSON>Benito Sanches</PERSON>, 29, who had been panhandling,
police said. Maya was in a stroller and her 18-month-old brother
was in <PERSON>Sanches</PERSON>' arms, <PERSON>Rosenthal</PERSON> said.
   ``Maya appeared to be in serious condition with trauma at least
around the face,'' <PERSON>Rosenthal</PERSON> said.
   He said <PERSON>Sanches</PERSON> had a habit of using the children to panhandle.
   ``He'll take two of the children of his girlfriend, put them in
a stroller and go out and solicit funds in their presence,''
<PERSON>Rosenthal</PERSON> said.
   The passerby, who had not been identified, stopped a cab, gave
the driver <MONEY>$5</MONEY> and told him to take <PERSON>Sanches</PERSON> and the children to a
hospital. The cab driver told police what had happened.
   <PERSON>Gardner</PERSON> said police were seeking the passerby.
   ``We appeal to him to come forward. We would like to speak to
him about what was going on,'' said <PERSON>Gardner</PERSON>.
   Sanches is a drug abuser with a past record who came to the
<LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> in <DATE>May 1980</DATE> with the Cuban boat lift, <PERSON>Gardner</PERSON> said.
He was charged with second-degree murder, said police Officer <PERSON>Jim
Coleman</PERSON>.
   Maya lived with her mother, her brother and <PERSON>Sanches</PERSON> at the
<ORGANIZATION>Prince George Hotel</ORGANIZATION> on <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>East Side</LOCATION>, where the city houses
463 homeless families, or about 2,600 people.
   The city provides housing for about 28,000 homeless people,
12,000 of them in welfare hotels and the remainder in shelters,
said spokeswoman <PERSON>Suzanne Trazoff</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Human Resources
Administration</ORGANIZATION>.
   Two weeks ago, 3-year-old <PERSON>Quintin McKenzie</PERSON> was scalded to death
in a bathtub at the hotel. His mother, <PERSON>Merian McKenzie</PERSON>, was charged
with second-degree murder and her husband, <PERSON>Calvin C. McKenzie</PERSON>, was
charged with assault for allegedly beating the toddler.
   ``These are terrible stories,'' said <PERSON>Ms. Trazoff</PERSON>.
   ``The Prince <PERSON>George</PERSON> has a large number of social services,'' she
said. A social service office, open during daytime hours, is
located in the hotel and a variety of programs are available,
including preschool and day care programs, she said.
   When asked why no one apparently noticed that the child had been
beaten, <PERSON>Ms. Trazoff</PERSON> speculated that the child's family may not have
requested any social services.
   The spokeswoman said <ORGANIZATION>HRA</ORGANIZATION> was checking its records to see if the
family had ever asked for help from the agency.
   The 18-month-old boy, whose name was not released, was admitted
to the hospital for observation although he had no visible signs of
abuse.
   Sanches and <PERSON>Ms. Vasquez</PERSON> had lived together for 16 months,
<PERSON>Rosenthal</PERSON> said. <PERSON>Ms. Vasquez</PERSON>'s two other children live with
relatives. The baby she had just had at <LOCATION>Bellevue</LOCATION> was the first the
couple had together.

   A panhandler who used a dying 3-year-old girl
and her brother to win sympathy has been charged in her beating
death, and police appealed for further help from the passerby who
tried to save her life.
   <PERSON>Benito Sanches</PERSON>, 36, a ``crack'' cocaine addict who came to
<LOCATION>America</LOCATION> in the <DATE>1980</DATE> Cuban boat lift, was charged <DATE>Friday</DATE> with
second-degree murder in the death of his girlfriend's daughter,
<PERSON>Maya Figueroa</PERSON>, police said.
   She was the second toddler in two weeks to die a violent death
at the city's biggest welfare hotel, The <ORGANIZATION>Prince George Hotel</ORGANIZATION>.
   Welfare workers had investigated the family for complaints of
abuse and neglect, but caseworkers had found no evidence of child
abuse, said <PERSON>Suzanne Trazoff</PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the city <ORGANIZATION>Human
Resources Administration</ORGANIZATION>.
   Detectives were investigating whether the girl's mother, <PERSON>Elise
Vasquez</PERSON>, 32, was involved in the alleged abuse, police Capt.
<PERSON>Michael Gardner</PERSON> said.
   On <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, the night Maya died, <PERSON>Ms. Vasquez</PERSON> was in <LOCATION>Bellevue
Hospital</LOCATION>, where she had given birth to her fifth child, a boy, the
day before.
   In an interview with the <ORGANIZATION>Daily News</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Friday</DATE> before signing
herself out of the hospital, <PERSON>Ms. Vasquez</PERSON> was quoted as saying she
did not believe <PERSON>Sanches</PERSON> had hurt Maya and said that ``he loved the
child like it was his own. ...
   ``She would call him `Dada.' She wanted to be with him and to
play with him. He would take her panhandling because she liked to
be with him,'' <PERSON>Ms. Vasquez</PERSON> said. ``She has been going out with him
for two years and he never laid a hand on her or any of the other
kids.''
   At the time of the battered girl's death <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, <PERSON>Maya</PERSON> and her
18-month-old brother were being used by <PERSON>Sanches</PERSON> as panhandling
props, police said. They said he had used them before to solicit
money.
   ``He hoped to get sympathy and compassion that way,'' said <PERSON>Aaron
H. Rosenthal</PERSON>, assistant chief of <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION> detectives.
   Maya was in her stroller when a concerned passerby noticed her
as <PERSON>Sanches</PERSON> begged for coins at 28th Street and Second Avenue at
<TIME>9:30 p.m.</TIME> <DATE>Thursday</DATE>. The man flagged down a taxi, gave the driver
<MONEY>$5</MONEY>, hustled the three into the cab and ordered the driver to take
them to a hospital, police said.
   Maya was declared dead on arrival at the emergency room at <ORGANIZATION>New
York University Medical Center</ORGANIZATION>. Her brother, whose name was
withheld, was admitted to the hospital for observation although he
showed no signs of abuse.
   Authorities questioned the cab driver; they hoped to locate the
good Samaritan and find out what he saw that night.
   ``We appeal to him to come forward. We would like to speak to
him about what was going on,'' <PERSON>Gardner</PERSON> said.
   An autopsy <DATE>Friday</DATE> indicated the toddler died of blunt force
injuries to her head and abdomen with internal injuries and
bleeding, said <PERSON>Ellen Borakove</PERSON> of the city medical examiner's
office. The case was ruled child abuse and a homicide.
   Maya had ``bruises and contusions on her face, back and neck.
Some of these bruises appeared to be recent,'' <PERSON>Gardner</PERSON> told a news
conference.
   The two children, their mother and <PERSON>Sanches</PERSON> lived at the <PERSON>Prince
George</PERSON> on <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>East Side</LOCATION>, which has 2,600 residents, mainly
homeless families. <PERSON>Ms. Vasquez</PERSON>'s two other children, ages 12 and
14, live with relatives in <LOCATION>Brooklyn</LOCATION>, police said.
   Two weeks ago, 3-year-old <PERSON>Quintin McKenzie</PERSON> was scalded to death
in a bathtub at the <ORGANIZATION>Prince George</ORGANIZATION>. His mother, <PERSON>Merian McKenzie</PERSON>, was
charged with second-degree murder, and her husband, <PERSON>Calvin C.
McKenzie</PERSON>, was charged with assault for allegedly beating the
toddler.
   At the <PERSON>Prince George</PERSON> on <DATE>Friday</DATE>, a steady stream of people flowed
in and out of the two steel doors guarding the threadbare lobby.
Many of them pushed strollers or had young children by the hand.
   ``I have to say it: it's drugs,'' said a 21-year-old woman with
a stroller, who identified herself only as <ORGANIZATION>Maria</ORGANIZATION>. ``If they don't
get money for the drugs, they take it out on the kids.''
   ``It's drugs,'' said <PERSON>Dr. Maria New</PERSON>, who chairs the <ORGANIZATION>Pediatrics
Department</ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION>New York-Cornell Medical Center</ORGANIZATION>. ``<PERSON>McKenzie</PERSON> was
drugs, and now this one, all drugs.''

<DESCRIPT>  TRAVEL; HISTORY; MEXICO  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  WEARY of burning your retinas on the same old Mexican beach vacation? How
about a visit to "El Mundo Maya" instead?;    If it's a phrase you haven't
heard yet, be prepared: El Mundo Maya -- the world of the Maya -- is one of
the waves of the future in vacation travel to Mexico and Central America. You
may also hear it referred to as "La Ruta Maya," the route of the Maya, but the
idea is similar -- travel to the developed and undeveloped Mayan sites in
Mexico, Belize, Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador.  </LEADPARA>

<MEMO>  Destination: Mexico
See also related story on P. 1T, 6T, 7T, 8T, and 9T of this section  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     And there are hundreds of them, stretching from heavily visited places,
such as <LOCATION>Tulum</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>'s Yucatan, to <LOCATION>Tikal</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Guatemala</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Copan</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Honduras</LOCATION>
and lesser-known sites in war-torn <LOCATION>El Salvador.</LOCATION>;    Whether <PERSON>Mundo Maya</PERSON> or <ORGANIZATION>Ruta
Maya</ORGANIZATION>, the words will most likely also be linked to what has already become one
of the big trends in travel for the <DATE>1990s</DATE>: ecotourism. Ecotourism basically
means environmentally sensitive and socially conscious travel to wilderness
areas, especially those in underdeveloped parts of the world.;    The
underlying idea is that such travel, if it is well-managed, can prevent damage
to pristine areas, while generating enough income to keep the natives from
ravaging the same environment -- rain forests, for example -- to eke out a
living.;    In the <DATE>last two years</DATE>, a series of meetings among commercial and
governmental tourism officials in the five nations has found general accord
with linking tourists on a Mayan route through <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> and parts of <LOCATION>Central
America</LOCATION>. It even seems likely that a Mundo Maya "passport" will be created at
some point, to ease travel among the nations.;    But the concern of many
environmentalists is that <ORGANIZATION>El Mundo Maya</ORGANIZATION> will simply become another way for
<LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> to generate tourist dollars.;    The commercial operators are "more
concerned with tourism, and we're more concerned with preservation," says <PERSON>Bill
Garrett</PERSON>, founder and president of <ORGANIZATION>La Ruta Maya Conservation Foundation</ORGANIZATION> and a
former editor of <ORGANIZATION>National Geographic</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>Garrett</PERSON> wrote an article for the <DATE>October
1989</DATE> Geographic that outlined ambitious plans to preserve and protect the
Mayan sites and their surrounding rain forests and preserves.;    <PERSON>Garrett</PERSON>
recalls watching in horror as guides ran boats close to a huge flock of
flamingos near <LOCATION>Celestun</LOCATION> in the <LOCATION>Gulf of Mexico</LOCATION>, and made loud noises to spook
the birds into flight so tourists on the boats could get better pictures.
That's ecoterrorism, not ecotourism, he says.;    "At some point, they're
going to have to enforce the rules," <PERSON>Garrett</PERSON> says. "Most tourists aren't going
to get mad and go home if you say, 'Don't break the rules.' ";     IF YOU'RE
INTERESTED; Those seeking a reliable ecotourism operator can purchase the
<ORGANIZATION>Directory of Alternative Travel Resources</ORGANIZATION> by sending <MONEY>$7.50</MONEY> to One World Family
Travel Network, 81868 Lost Valley Lane, <PERSON>Dexter</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Ore.</LOCATION> 97431; (503) 937-3351. A

<TEXT>     She was, of course, mistaken: At every bus stop in the capital, Mayan men
and women stand waiting for their rides to work. Yet the teen-ager's ignorance
was somehow logical.;    Her ancestors, the Spanish conquistadors, had wiped
out nine of every 10 Maya Indians they had found in <LOCATION>Guatemala</LOCATION> in the 16th
century.;    <DATE>Four hundred years later</DATE>, her people, called Ladinos, run a
government that does little more than the minimum to improve the lot of the
surviving indigenes, whom they call simply "Indios" and who constitute more
than <PERCENT>40 percent</PERCENT> of the popula tion.;    The golden age of the ancient Maya,
the most advanced pre-Columbian civilization in the <LOCATION>New World</LOCATION>, lasted from
A.D. 250 to 900.;    During that time, they built such magnificent cities as
<ORGANIZATION>Chichen Itza</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Palenque</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Uxmal</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>; <LOCATION>Copan</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Honduras</LOCATION>; and <ORGANIZATION>Caracol</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Belize</LOCATION>. The greatest Mayan city of all is <LOCATION>Tikal</LOCATION>, which has become <LOCATION>Guatemala</LOCATION>'s
No. 1 tourist attraction.;    But many of the visitors to the <LOCATION>Tikal</LOCATION> ruins
don't realize that more than 3 million Maya live in <LOCATION>Guatemala</LOCATION> today -- more
than are found in the other Central American countries and <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> put
together. <LOCATION>Guatemala</LOCATION> remains the heartland of Mayan civilization.;    No
pretext for a visit to <LOCATION>Guatemala</LOCATION> is more compelling than to make acquaintance
with the Maya -- both ancient and living.;    There are many other reasons to
travel to our nearest Central American neighbor: The alpine beauty of the
volcanic highlands, a remarkably favorable exchange rate between the dollar
and the quetzal, a cross-cultural openness in the hinterlands that, in the
words of photojournalist <PERSON>Galen Rowell</PERSON>, reminds one of the free-and-easy hippie
ambiance of <LOCATION>Katmandu</LOCATION> in the 1960s.;    And, despite continuing skirmishes
between guerrillas and the army, <LOCATION>Guatemala</LOCATION> is safe for visitors. There is
little of the anti-American feeling found in <LOCATION>El Salvador</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Nicaragua</LOCATION> and
Panama.;    Visitors fly into the capital, <LOCATION>Guatemala City</LOCATION>. A day there is long
enough, time to wander through its excellent museums housing everything from
ancient Mayan artifacts to modern art, before heading west.;    A smoggy
metropolis, the city was leveled by earthquakes in <DATE>1917</DATE> and <DATE>1976</DATE>, and as a
result little remains of colonial architecture.;    Only 30 miles west lies
<LOCATION>Antigua Guatemala</LOCATION>, where the Spanish built a colonial capital to rival <LOCATION>Mexico
City</LOCATION>. The population today is only 16,000, but the town breathes the
melancholy grandeur of the conquest.;    Half-ruined baroque churches by the
dozen; clean cobblestone streets and bright-hued housefronts; a glimpse of
cool inner patios spangled with hand-painted tiles; and rising 7,000 feet
above the village, the steep blue cone of <ORGANIZATION>Volcan Agua</ORGANIZATION>, its summit lost in
mist.;    The road wends on, deeper into the highlands, till you come suddenly
upon <LOCATION>Lake Atitlan</LOCATION>, rimmed by tall mountains whose shoulders slope into the
dark water.;    Tucked in a wrinkle of its north shore is the village of
<LOCATION>Panajachel</LOCATION>, full of Cakchiquel-speaking Maya and blissed-out hippies, both
young and aging, from <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Holland</LOCATION> and even the <LOCATION>United
States.</LOCATION>;    A morning ferry traverses the lake to the village of <LOCATION>Santiago
Atitlan</LOCATION>. Cross the waters and you have changed cultures, though at first blush
the markets and churches look the same.;    In <LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION>, though, the women
wear white garments, called huipils, instead of the red and blue huipils in
<LOCATION>Panajachel</LOCATION>. The people speak Tzutuhil instead of Cakchiquel.;    They were
once, in fact, enemies, and if you knew how to probe skillfully enough, you
might still uncover the old Tzutuhil bitterness against their neighbors, who
allied themselves with the butcher <PERSON>Pedro de Alvarado</PERSON>, a lieutenant of <PERSON>Hernando
Cortes</PERSON>, who conquered <LOCATION>Guatemala</LOCATION> in <DATE>1524</DATE>, bringing Christianity with him.;   
Nothing in Mayan life today is more bizarre than the amalgamation of pagan
with Catholic beliefs.;    In the <LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION> church, there is a statue of a
"saint" called Maximon, supposed to be a combination of <ORGANIZATION>Judas</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Pedro de
Alvarado</PERSON> and the Mayan god <ORGANIZATION>Mam</ORGANIZATION>. Other towns have a Maximon, whom the people
revile every year during Holy Week. In <LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION>, for some reason, at Easter
they take <PERSON>Maximon</PERSON> out of his cupboard, stick a cigar in his mouth and revere
him.;    The most intriguing highland town is <LOCATION>Chichicastenango</LOCATION>, 25 miles north
of <LOCATION>Lake Atitlan</LOCATION>. The town is an ancient center of the Quiche (KEE-chay), who
are among the most traditional of today's Maya.;    The market is held every
<DATE>Thursday</DATE> and <DATE>Sunday</DATE>. Rich in the superbly woven textiles for which the Maya
are famous, the market also displays cunning painted boxes, jade necklaces and
the lurid masks the <ORGANIZATION>Maya</ORGANIZATION> use in their dances.;    From the highlands,
travelers can fly to the <LOCATION>Peten</LOCATION>, in the northern lowlands, <LOCATION>Guatemala</LOCATION>'s wild
west. There is only one paved road -- the main route to Tikal.;    The
countryside is seamed with rivers, and the outboard-powered dugout canoe is as
vital to commerce as the diesel truck.;    <PERSON>Flores</PERSON>, a tiny island town in <LOCATION>Lake
Peten Itza</LOCATION>, is worth a few days' stay.;    From there, you can hire a taxi for
the 40-mile trip to <LOCATION>Tikal</LOCATION>. Chichen Itza in the Yucatan, the most visited of
all Mayan cities, feels somehow tame, gardened and restored.;    But in <LOCATION>Tikal</LOCATION>,
deep in the tangled rain forest of the <LOCATION>Peten</LOCATION>, a primal rawness lingers about
the ruins. A team of archaeologists from the <ORGANIZATION>University of Pennsylvania</ORGANIZATION> worked
for 13 years in <LOCATION>Tikal</LOCATION> in the <DATE>1960s</DATE> and <DATE>1970s.</DATE>;    They found more than 3,000
buildings spread over six square miles. Yet for all their labor, most of the
great city remains unexcavated.;    In <LOCATION>Tikal</LOCATION>, find your way to <LOCATION>El Mundo
Perdido</LOCATION>, the lost city, whose squat pyramids were built in the Pre-classic
era, long before anything else in <LOCATION>Tikal.</LOCATION>;    Or prowl through the <LOCATION>North
Acropolis</LOCATION> and locate the huge, grotesque molded heads hidden in dank side
chambers.;    Walk the <PERSON>Maler Causeway</PERSON> out to <ORGANIZATION>Group H</ORGANIZATION>, where the walls abound
in enigmatic Mayan graffiti. Climb to the roof comb of <ORGANIZATION>Temple IV</ORGANIZATION>, at 212 feet
the tallest building ever found in pre-Columbian <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>, and see how, for all
its grandeur, <LOCATION>Tikal</LOCATION> is nearly swallowed by the jungle that stretches to the
far horizon.; If you go . . .; (check) Getting There; Several airlines,
including <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> and American, fly to <LOCATION>Guatemala City</LOCATION>. From there, daily
flights go to Flores in the <LOCATION>Peten</LOCATION>. These cannot be booked from the <LOCATION>United
States</LOCATION> but are seldom sold out.;    (check) TOURS -- Several American travel
companies offer one- or two-week guided tours of <LOCATION>Guatemala</LOCATION>. One of the best is
run by <ORGANIZATION>Sobek Expeditions</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>P.O.</LOCATION> Box <DATE>1089</DATE>, Angels Camp 95222;(800) 777-7939.
Other tour operators include Overseas Adventure Travel, (617) 876-0533; <PERSON>Tara
Tours</PERSON>, (800) 327-0080; and <ORGANIZATION>Festival Tours</ORGANIZATION>, (800) 327-2838. The <ORGANIZATION>Guatemalan
Tourist Information Office</ORGANIZATION> is (305) 358-5110.;    (check) RENTAL CARS -- The
best way to see the highlands is by rental car, but it is easier and
remarkably inexpensive (about <MONEY>$40</MONEY> a day or less) to hire a car and driver for
days at a time.;    (check) WHERE TO STAY -- The Hotel Atitlan in <LOCATION>Panajachel</LOCATION>,
with its secluded beach and splendid flower garden, may be the most delightful
inn in <LOCATION>Guatemala</LOCATION>. The Mayan Inn in <LOCATION>Chichicastenango</LOCATION> is a close rival. In
<PERSON>Flores</PERSON> there are a number of decent, cheap hotels (<MONEY>$15</MONEY>-<MONEY>$20</MONEY> per night). The
Jungle Inn at <LOCATION>Tikal</LOCATION> has clean rooms and a funky ambiance.  </TEXT>

'Now this,' said <PERSON>Senor Gomez</PERSON> pointing, 'is called <ORGANIZATION>El Castillo</ORGANIZATION> in Spanish. It
means the castle. But it is not a castle. It is a highly accurate
multi-purpose calendar.'
WE TURNED in the direction he indicated, but saw neither a castle nor a
calendar. Instead, set in the middle of a vast grassy area where guided
tourist groups scurried to and fro, we saw a broad terraced pyramid rising
75ft into the air. Built of grey stone, it was the exact colour of the heavy
storm clouds that hung in the sky behind it.
On each of its four sides a steep flight of steps led up to a flat-topped
temple at its summit. Like ants on an antheap, the stairs and temple-top
were crawling with hundreds of figures dressed in bright red-and-yellow
nylon rain-jackets. Rain threatened.
Our own party was a large, mixed group - mostly German, Italian and Japanese
 -and few of us had an easy command of English. But this did not stop <PERSON>Senor
Gomez</PERSON> from delivering his guided commentary in a succession of rapid, jerky
bursts that left little time for reflection on what it all might mean. This,
after all, was a busy day at <ORGANIZATION>Chichen Itza</ORGANIZATION>, the most famous of the Yucatan's
Maya Indian ruins, and it looked as if the weather might break at any
minute.
'Now why do I say <PERSON>El Castillo</PERSON> is a multi-purpose calendar?'
A Japanese lady lifted a video camera to her eye and began filming him.
'Well, the Mayas were very interested in measuring time. There are 91 steps
on each of the four faces of the pyramid. That makes 364. Add one more for
the platform at the top and that makes 365, the exact number of days in one
year.' He beamed at us as if this explained it all. But there was more.
'Also, the staircases on each of the pyramid's nine levels show the 18
months of the Maya solar year, and the 52 panels on each side show the
52-year periods of the <ORGANIZATION>Maya</ORGANIZATION> calendar cycle.' <PERSON>Senor Gomez</PERSON> was getting into
his stride.
'How did the Mayas combine their ritual calendar of 260 days and their solar
calendar of 365 days so the same calculations were possible on both? Easy -
they found a common divisor. Both numbers are divisible by five. By
multiplying five times 52 cycles of 365 days by 73 cycles of 260 days, they
obtained 18,980 days, or 52 years, permitting perfect computations within
the Maya 52-year calendar cycle.'
We stared at him, speechless.
'Fantastico, no?'
Senor Gomez glared around him, as if waiting to be challenged on the clarity
of his explanation. Nobody challenged him. The Japanese lady stopped
filming. 'Say again,' she said.
'No time,' shouted <PERSON>Senor Gomez</PERSON> over his shoulder as he strode off across the
grass, perspiring in the warm and muggy air. 'Now follow me to the <ORGANIZATION>Ball
Court</ORGANIZATION>. It is a very interesting game. Under Maya rules, the captain of the
team that won was sacrificed to the gods. It was a great honour. Funny, no?
Come. I have many, many things to show you.'
I had had enough and wandered off to climb <PERSON>El Castillo</PERSON>. A puffing 91 steps
later, I was standing on the top and looking out over the endless, dull
green, table-flat jungle of the Yucatan peninsula.
How odd that in the midst of this great expanse of nothing a people more
than 1,000 years ago should have built great cities. How much odder that
they developed a high theocratic culture with advanced mathematics and
astronomy at its pinnacle.
It was scarcely surprising, I thought, that in a tour lasting barely two
hours <PERSON>Senor Gomez</PERSON> found himself hard put to explain the complexities of
Mayan civilisation. Its subtle yet exacting combination of science and
spirituality has baffled trained minds ever since ruined cities began
re-emerging from the Yucatan jungles a century ago. Together, Mayan culture
and <PERSON>Senor Gomez</PERSON> had certainly baffled my mind.
But the complexities of pre-history have not stopped Yucatan from becoming
one of the most popular regions for visitors to <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> today. Almost
everyone who comes to the peninsula that divides the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> from the <LOCATION>Gulf
of Mexico</LOCATION> is attracted by the lure of the ancient Mayas. They end up
enjoying it not just for the ruins of the Mayas of the past  - which tend to
be over-crowded, commercialised and difficult to understand - but for a
special atmosphere created by the Mayas of the present.
Rain began to splatter in heavy, warm drops. Straggling crowds streamed
through acres of monuments to seek shelter in refreshment stands and tour
coaches. On the way home to our hotels, a long, dreary drive through low
tropical bushland, the rain continued to fall in heavy sheets. By the time
we reached <LOCATION>Merida</LOCATION> <TIME>some two hours later</TIME>, water had flooded the narrow streets
of the town, stalled cars at intersections, and was lapping over the
sidewalks.
Unable to stir out, I spent the afternoon watching the rain fall onto the
lush vegetation of the inner courtyard garden of the <ORGANIZATION>Grande Hotel</ORGANIZATION>. A long,
cool drink at hand, I lay back in a rattan-woven planter's chair, the kind
in which colonials in every tropical outpost from <LOCATION>Calcutta</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Kumasi</LOCATION> have
taken their ease. Surrounded by pillastered columns, etched-glass windows,
tropical hardwood furniture and slowly-whirling fans, I felt like a Merida
sisal king.
In the mid-1850s, some 300 years after the Spanish conquistadors had
virtually enslaved the <LOCATION>Mayas</LOCATION>, Spanish landowners discovered sisal. Used for
making rope and matting, the fibre found a ready market in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> and the
<LOCATION>US</LOCATION>. By the <DATE>late 19th century</DATE>, the great plantation owners had made Merida a
gracious colonial city boasting more millionaires per capita than any other
in the world.
They sent their children to the best schools in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, imported treasures
from all over the world, and led the luxurious life of an aristocracy. To
the baroque cathedrals, governors' palaces and colonial plazas built by
earlier generations of Spaniards in <LOCATION>Merida</LOCATION>, they added scores of
French-inspired mansions and the <PERSON>Paseo Montejo</PERSON> - a miniature Champs Elysees.
The boom in sisal is long over but <LOCATION>Merida</LOCATION>'s traditions and independent
spirit, like its architecture, food, music and language, remain. For
centuries Yucatecans have lived isolated lives on their southern peninsula.
Cut off from the rest of the country by vast swamps and jungles, they have
always been a group apart, and proud of it.
And what of those Yucatecans who are descended from the builders of the
pyramids? Present-day <PERSON>Mayas</PERSON> - many of them remain pure-blooded - may have
lost political independence and the ability to calculate precise dates 90m
years in advance, but they remain gentle, intelligent, good-humoured people.
To anyone coming from other large Mexican cities where traditional machismo
is so much part of the culture, <ORGANIZATION>Merida</ORGANIZATION>'s 500,000 inhabitants seem an
unusually relaxed and friendly lot.
By the time darkness fell, the rain had stopped, the streets had dried, and
I was able to venture out for that favourite <ORGANIZATION>Merida</ORGANIZATION> past-time, the evening
paseo. Crowds of strollers had gathered on the Plaza Mayor, and <DATE>Christmas</DATE>,
only days away, had brought to the square a special atmosphere.
Trees, lamp-standards and statues were festooned with coloured lights and
paper. At wheeled streetside stalls, dark-haired women in embroidered
blouses were selling snacks of fried plantain, roasted corn and refreshing
glasses of sweet, almond-flavoured horchata. From long poles balanced on
their shoulders, ambulating hawkers sold children's toys: balloons, horns,
masks and flutes. Dressed in their holiday best, enormous families piled
into horse-drawn carriages for an idle tour of the town.
There was no lack of entertainment. Outside the door of the <ORGANIZATION>Grande Hotel</ORGANIZATION>, a
sidewalk marimba band was floating hot Latin rhythms out into the <TIME>night</TIME>. Up
the street in the cathedral, a choir was singing <PERSON>Mozart</PERSON>'s Requiem. And on
the square itself, tiny children with dark, bright eyes were re-enacting the
<LOCATION>Nativity</LOCATION>. In 80'F heat, four-year-old Wise Men in silver paper crowns and
cotton-wool beards led a sad-looking Mexican donkey loaded with gifts to a
manger in a mock-up <LOCATION>Bethlehem</LOCATION>.
But I contented myself with just a turn or two around the square. I had work
to do. By my bedside table lay a complex tome by the learned Prof <PERSON>Demitrio
Morales</PERSON>. Its title: The <ORGANIZATION>Maya World</ORGANIZATION>. Tomorrow I would be visiting <LOCATION>Uxmal</LOCATION>,
another of the Yucatan's great archaeological sites. I was determined this
time, with the professor's help, not to be taken by surprise by a certain
<PERSON>Senor Gomez</PERSON>.
There are no direct flights between the <ORGANIZATION>UK</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Nicholas Woodsworth</PERSON>
flew to Yucatan with <ORGANIZATION>American Airlines</ORGANIZATION> (<LOCATION>London</LOCATION> tel: 081-572-5555), which
flies via <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> to the Yucatan resort city of <LOCATION>Cancun</LOCATION>. Car hire in <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> is
expensive - about Dollars 80 a day - but many local companies organise tours
of Mayan archaeological sites.
The best time to visit Yucatan is between <DATE>September</DATE> and <DATE>April</DATE>, when rainfall
is at its lowest. Expect, nonetheless, a warm and humid tropical climate,
and take rainwear.
In <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, information about travel in <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> can be obtained from the
<ORGANIZATION>Mexican Tourist Office</ORGANIZATION> at 60 <ORGANIZATION>Trafalgar Square</ORGANIZATION>, WC2N 5DS. Tel: 071-734-1058.

<LEADPARA>  Archaeologists digging in the jungle of Guatemala have found the tomb and
remains of an eighth-century ruler who they believe began the policies of
militarism and territorial expansion that eventually led to the collapse of
the classical Maya civilization.;    Dr. Arthur A. Demarest, an archaeologist
at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, announced Tuesday that the discovery
was made beneath the ruins of a pyramid at Dos Pilas, the ancient capital of
the Petexbatun region of Guatemala.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Front  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  TEAM SAYS IT FOUND TOMB OF WARLIKE KING WHO
DESTROYED MAYAS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     The tomb contained the skeleton of a man accompanied by a regal headdress
of jade, conch and pearl, obsidian blades probably used in bloodletting
ceremonies and ceramics inscribed with hieroglyphics.;    <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s burial site; 
Scholars at the site said they were almost certain that the skeleton is that
of Ruler 2, so called because the hieroglyphics giving his name have not been
deciphered. A monument at the pyramid indicates that this is the burial site
of that particular king, and the writing on pottery found inside the tomb is
expected to confirm the skeleton's identity.;    "It looks like we've got a
large dead king in there," <PERSON>Demarest</PERSON> said in an interview by telephone from
Guatemala.;    The tomb's discovery, along with excavations of extensive
fortifications at <LOCATION>Dos Pilas</LOCATION> and other evidence of relentless warfare, is
expected to figure in new interpretations of the <LOCATION>Mayas</LOCATION> as a more militaristic
people than had been thought by earlier scholars.;    It could also illuminate
the causes of the mysterious fall of lowland Mayan culture beginning in the
<DATE>eighth century</DATE> and culminating in the 10th.;    Militaristic past;  "This is
going to change the textbooks radically," <PERSON>Demarest</PERSON> said. "Ruler 2 was a
pivotal figure in the initiation of the catastrophic sequence of events in
which the polity broke up into a dozen warring states that militarized the
landscape within a period of 50 years and may have destroyed the ecology of
the region.";    Ruler 2 reigned between 698 and 725 over the Petexbatun
region, which spanned some 2,000 square miles along the <LOCATION>Pasion River</LOCATION> in
northern <LOCATION>Guatemala</LOCATION>. Ruler 2 and his successor conquered neighboring
city-states and created the largest kingdom in Mayan history. The Mayas'
classic period began with the rise of large cities and elaborate ceremonial
centers around A.D. 250 and, in the south at least, collapsed by the year
900.;    Other archaeologists said this was one of the most significant recent
discoveries in Mayan studies. But many of them were not yet prepared to accept
<PERSON>Demarest</PERSON>'s interpretation that a rapid escalation of warfare and territorial
expansion doomed the Mayan civilization.;    Theory disputed;  <PERSON>Dr. Jeremy A.
Sabloff</PERSON>, an authority on Mayan archaeology at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Pittsburgh</ORGANIZATION>,
called <ORGANIZATION>Demarest</ORGANIZATION>'s research "very important and exciting" but said he doubted
that a single factor, like destructive warfare, accounted for the fall of the
Mayan civilization.;    <PERSON>Dr. David Webster</PERSON>, an archaeologist at <ORGANIZATION>Pennsylvania
State University</ORGANIZATION> who specializes in Mayan warfare, said the discovery "will
tell us a great deal about the dissolution of these kingdoms and about the
role of warfare in this dissolution.";    Excavations at <LOCATION>Dos Pilas</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Webster</PERSON>
said, focused attention on a major shift in scholarly attitudes toward the
Mayan culture. Until recent years, scholars tended to idealize the Mayas as
peaceful and industrious people. The only warfare was supposed to be the
limited, ritualized battles fought between rulers as part of dynastic
struggles, but rarely involving the common people.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>
   A jungle-shrouded city of pyramids and
temples in <LOCATION>Guatemala</LOCATION> was built as long ago as 630 B.C., showing
that Mayan civilization blossomed about four centuries earlier than
believed, scientists say.
   The findings may make the ancient city of Nakbe in northern
<LOCATION>Guatemala</LOCATION> one of the oldest in the <LOCATION>Americas</LOCATION>, researchers said.
   ``It's a very significant discovery,'' said <PERSON>Arthur Demarest</PERSON>,
anthropology chairman at <ORGANIZATION>Vanderbilt University</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Tennessee</LOCATION>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>University of California</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, on <DATE>Monday</DATE> announced
the findings by archaeologist <PERSON>Richard Hansen</PERSON> and colleagues at
<ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Brigham Young University</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Guatemala</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>University of
San Carlos</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``We have substantial evidence that this is the earliest Maya
urban center ever found,'' <PERSON>Hansen</PERSON> said.
   BYU anthropology chairman <PERSON>Donald Forsyth</PERSON> added, ``We're now
going to have to push the beginning of Maya civilization back
further into the past.''
   Archaeologists once believed advanced Mayan civilization emerged
around A.D. 300 and ended 600 years later during what is described
as the ``classic period.'' Research conducted during 1978-83 at <LOCATION>El
Mirador</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Guatemala</LOCATION>, pushed that date back to 200 B.C.
   But in excavating <LOCATION>Nakbe</LOCATION>, 350 miles north of <LOCATION>Guatemala City</LOCATION> and
not far from <LOCATION>El Mirador</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Hansen</PERSON>'s 50-member team determined that
roughly 100 stone pyramids and other buildings were from about 630
B.C. to 400 <ORGANIZATION>B.C</ORGANIZATION>. So were some of the site's 65,000 pottery pieces,
sculptures, figurines and other artifacts.
   Dates can be determined by the radioactivity of carbon in
organic material associated with buildings. Pottery is dated by
comparison with the style of shards from elsewhere in <LOCATION>Central
America</LOCATION>.
   ``We have from <DATE>1000</DATE> B.C. to 600 B.C. a small village with wooden
buildings,'' <PERSON>Hansen</PERSON> said by telephone from his home in <LOCATION>Rupert</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION>. ``Then all of a sudden _ boom! They brought in rock and fill
and buried the village and made platforms. On those they placed
their buildings.''
   <PERSON>Hansen</PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION>Nakbe</ORGANIZATION>'s buildings include 35- to 150-foot-tall
platforms and flat-topped pyramids, many of which are topped by
three small temples and sculpture depicting important gods and
kings. The buildings are solid, without interior rooms.
   The scale of construction reflects the emergence of an
administrative and religious elite to command thousands of workers,
<PERSON>Hansen</PERSON> said.
   Anthropologist <PERSON>John Graham</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>University of California</ORGANIZATION>,
<LOCATION>Berkeley</LOCATION>, said an even earlier center of advanced Mayan
civilization may be found.
   Still, <PERSON>Graham</PERSON> said, the <PERSON>Nabke</PERSON> study ``is part of the most
exciting Maya discovery of recent decades.''
   The discovery solves a puzzle for archaeologists: The Mayans
seemed to evolve more slowly from farming communities to cities
than other pre-Columbian civilizations to the north and south. But
archaeologists say <ORGANIZATION>Nakbe</ORGANIZATION> proves that Mayan development occurred
more or less in step with the rise of the Olmec culture in <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>,
thought to be the oldest civilization of the Americas.
   An archaeologist mapped some of <ORGANIZATION>Nakbe</ORGANIZATION>'s architecture in <DATE>1962</DATE>.
Hansen first visited in <DATE>1987</DATE> and his team conducted the first
full-scale excavation <DATE>last February</DATE> through <DATE>April</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Hansen</PERSON>'s team hacked their way through dense jungle for three
days and 40 miles to reach Nakbe from the nearest road. They hauled
water from a swamp 4 miles away. Demarest admiringly called it
``macho archaeology.''
   Among the most important finds at <ORGANIZATION>Nakbe</ORGANIZATION> is a sculpture on a
limestone slab that probably dates from about 400 <ORGANIZATION>B.C.</ORGANIZATION> and is about
10 feet tall, 4 feet wide and 18 inches thick.
   The sculpture of two royal figures and a god ``is the earliest
and largest preclassic sculpture ever found,'' <PERSON>Hansen</PERSON> said.
   Other discoveries include seashells and obsidian glass tools
that indicate emergence of long-distance trade. There also are
signs of a society taming its environment: gutter-like water
collection systems on six buildings and 60-foot-wide stone-and-mud
roads, <PERSON>Hansen</PERSON> said.
   He said he believes transformation from village to city happened
because trade and the need for water and transportation fostered
emergence of an administrative and religious elite, which then
ordered construction of temples.

STOLEN CONTINENTS: THE INDIAN STORY by <PERSON>Roland Wright John Murray</PERSON> Pounds
19.95, 424 pages
'FOR FIVE centuries,' writes <PERSON>Roland Wright</PERSON>, 'we have listened only to the
history of the winners.' Stolen Continents redresses the balance by
portraying the European 'discovery' of the continents of <LOCATION>North and South
America</LOCATION> from a 'native' perspective.
In selecting the <ORGANIZATION>Aztecs, Mayas</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Incas</LOCATION>, Iroquois and <ORGANIZATION>Cherokee</ORGANIZATION>, he has focused
on the most complex societies for whom the greatest source material is
available. 'The five I have chosen must therefore stand for the many who
will never tell their stories because they are extinct. The silence of the
<LOCATION>Caribbean Taino</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>Newfoundland Beothuk</LOCATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION>Ona of Tierra del Fuego</ORGANIZATION>
is the most terrible eloquence of all.'
Wright portrays the history of these five groupings during three phases:
invasion, resistance, rebirth. The book is timely, not just because this
year marks the 500th anniversary of <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>'s first voyage across the
<LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION>, but because <PERSON>Wright</PERSON> follows the story through to the vociferous
nationalism of today.
His account is passionate and moving. Through reconstruction of wide-ranging
primary sources the reader can relive the agonies of the original
inhabitants at the hands of the invaders. But whereas we may be accustomed
to the devrecounted in the sixteenth-century Florentine Code, the continued
persecution of the indigenous population comes as a surprise. The memoirs of
the Guatemalan Mayan activist <PERSON>Rigoberta Menchu</PERSON>, written in <DATE>1982</DATE>, are so
horrific that <PERSON>Wright</PERSON> admits some people may not believe that such horrors
really happened.
Wright sees the superior European attitude towards the 'primitive' natives
as almost laughable were the consequences not so tragic. The 'Requirement'
read by the sixteenth-century Spaniards to the local people at each
encounter demanded they submit to God, the Pope and the Church. 'And if you
do not do this . . . with the help of God I shall come mightily against you,
and I shall make war on you everywhere . . . and I shall do all the evil and
damage to you that I am able. And insist that the deaths and destruction
that result from this will be your fault.' This 'shabby document', as <PERSON>Wright</PERSON>
points out, was a symbolic necessity to justify outright plunder. The
Indians understood neither its meaning nor its intent.
Apologists for the European 'invasion' rightly point out that what decimated
the local people was not so much warfare but European diseases. But <PERSON>Wright</PERSON>
stresses the consequences of Lord <PERSON>Jeffrey Amherst</PERSON>'s command against the
Iroquois in <DATE>1762</DATE>. 'Infect the Indians with sheets upon which smallpox
patients have been lying or by any other means which may serve to
exterminate this accursed race.' The epidemic raged all <DATE>summer</DATE>, says <PERSON>Wright</PERSON>.
'One by one the leaders who survived it were compelled to sue for peace.'
Whether he is talking about the <LOCATION>Incas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Aztecs</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mayas</LOCATION>, of <LOCATION>South</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Mesoamerica</LOCATION>, or the Cherokee and Iroquois of <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION>, the 'Indian
story' is a tawdry one of misunderstanding and betrayal. Time and again the
new arrivals in <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION> reneged on their treaty obligations with the
original inhabitants who had once made them welcome.
There never was any expectation that the 'white' and 'Indian' cultures might
coexist. Thousands of books of Mayan hieroglyphs were destroyed because the
Spaniards could not understand them. When finally the remaining few were
deciphered, they revealed advanced astronomical information. In their
attempt to eradicate the Inca culture, the Spaniards banned Ouecha song,
music and theatre. Even well-meant reforms backfired.
Although the title of the book indicates that the continents of North and
<LOCATION>South America</LOCATION> have been 'stolen' from their pre-Columbian inhabitants, the
reader is left in no doubt that 500 years later the 'theft' is still being
contested by those who have not lost sight of their ancient culture or
language. 'If <LOCATION>Guatemala</LOCATION> really had majority rule, it would be a Maya
republic,' says <PERSON>Wright</PERSON>. In the Andes 12m people speak the Inca language.
There are more Iroquois living in <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION> than there have been for
three and a half centuries. And the eastern Cherokees have managed to remain
in the <LOCATION>Great Smoky</LOCATION> mountains where they lived in pre-Columbian times.

In <DATE>1988</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>La Jolla</ORGANIZATION>'s Iturralde Gallery (then La Casa del Arte) showed a series 
of lithographs by <ORGANIZATION>Lucia Maya</ORGANIZATION> that were inspired by the extraordinarily prolific 
and passionate life of Mexican artist <PERSON>Frida Kahlo</PERSON>. Maya's affinity for <PERSON>Kahlo</PERSON>'s 
precise, naturalistic style of rendering and her symbolic, surreal imagery made 
the series as much a dialogue between kindred spirits as a homage to a 
legendary life. 
</P>
<P>
This month, an extensive selection of <ORGANIZATION>Maya</ORGANIZATION>'s paintings, prints and drawings can 
be seen at the <ORGANIZATION>Centro Cultural Tijuana</ORGANIZATION> in a show titled "Umbral de las 
Transfiguraciones" (Threshold of Transfigurations). Though <PERSON>Kahlo</PERSON>'s striking 
visage is nowhere to be found here, her pointed, poignant approach is present 
throughout. 
</P>
<P>
Maya, who was born on <LOCATION>Catalina Island</LOCATION> and now lives in <LOCATION>Guadalajara</LOCATION>, never 
musters the same blend of toughness and vulnerability that makes <PERSON>Kahlo</PERSON>'s work 
so singularly intriguing. Her intent, though, differs substantially. The mood 
she consistently creates is less intimate and revealing than <PERSON>Kahlo</PERSON>'s and, 
instead, feels like a melange of received styles: saccharine sweetness, Gothic 
horror and surreal poetry. 
</P>
<P>
Maya's debt to the heritage of surrealism runs the deepest, especially in her 
use of familiar forms such as the human heart, in disjunctive, startling 
contexts. The heart appears throughout her work -- as vital organ, container of 
the 
</P>
<P>
soul, the spirit, and source of emotion. 
</P>
<P>
In the drawing, "Epifania de la Tierra" (Epiphany of the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>), hearts sprout 
from the soil like saplings yearning for the sun. On the horizon of this 
fertile field, uprooted trees soar into a sky charged with unrest. In the 
foreground, a young woman unearths one of the hearts to find a child's pair of 
legs attached. Her wide-eyed innocence mirrors our own before this bizarre 
vision of birth and tempestuous demise. 
</P>
<P>
Maya makes an analogy between the heart's arteries and a tree's branches in 
several images, part of a larger expression of her view of the affinity between 
human and organic realms. Two large, dynamic drawings of trees double as 
portraits of twisting torsos, rooted to the ground but with branches/arms 
reaching upward, striving for a higher reality. In "Madre Corazon" (Heart 
Mother), one of three delicate drawings on the theme of maternal, life-giving 
power, Maya substitutes a heart and healthy foliage for a woman's head and 
shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
The most profound use of the image of the heart appears in the painting, 
"Exodo" (Exodus), one of the quietest but most moving works in the show. A 
gray-haired man stands against a screen of tall, mist-enshrouded trees, his 
pale hazel eyes staring wistfully ahead. Beneath his arm he carries a small 
house, with a roof resembling a human heart and walls frayed into a web of 
ungrounded roots. A small patch of earth near him is stained red, indicating, 
perhaps, the site of the unrooting. "Exodo" illustrates in simple terms the 
adage that home is where the heart is, while also conveying a more complex and 
powerful portrait of loss, separation and exile. 
</P>
<P>
Maya layers seemingly incongruous emotional and physical states throughout her 
work, evoking images both provocative and unsettling. Often she wraps her 
female figures in white, cocoon-like shrouds, linking them to both nascent and 
decaying states. They lie immobile, in a permanent dream state, the favorite 
realm of the founders of surrealism. 
</P>
<P>
Death and life shadow each other closely here, two facets of the same evolving 
entity called existence. Their transfiguration from one into the other is 
rendered seamless in the painting, "Concepcion Inmaculada" (Immaculate 
Conception), where an auburn-maned woman and a similarly coiffed skeleton share 
a single white, billowing smock, bloated by the figure's pregnancy. The cycle 
of birth and death becomes truly circular here, part of a continuum played out 
at once by a single individual. 
</P>
<P>
Much of <ORGANIZATION>Maya</ORGANIZATION>'s work is, indeed, rich with poetic possibilities, but much is 
also mired in a stiff sentimentality. Her languorous sirens and brooding lovers 
drip with melodrama, cheap and over-acted, and her tight, linear drawing style 
sometimes stiffens and becomes static and lifeless. Underlying all of her work, 
however, is the potent realization that life and death, love and loss, the 
human and the organic all nurture each other while deepening each others' 
mysteries. 
</P>
<P>
Lucia Maya's work can be seen at the <ORGANIZATION>Centro Cultural Tijuana</ORGANIZATION> (on Paseo de los 
Heroes) through <DATE>Aug. 31</DATE>. Also on view in a separate show, through <DATE>Aug. 29</DATE>, is a 
strong selection of prints on the theme of the Mexican revolution.

NEW-FOUND SITE IN JUNGLE MAY BE FIRST MAYAN CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION> archeologist has identified what is apparently the earliest major center 
of Mayan civilization yet found, a discovery that extends the era of Mayan 
cities back four centuries into a period that was thought to be dominated by 
simple village life. 
</P>
<P>
The extensive stone monuments and temples in the newly discovered city of 
<ORGANIZATION>Nakbe</ORGANIZATION>, in the dense tropical forest of northern <LOCATION>Guatemala</LOCATION>, show "that the 
advances which created the most sophisticated pre-Columbian society in the <LOCATION>New 
World</LOCATION> may have occurred much earlier than was previously assumed," said <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION>'s 
<PERSON>Richard Hansen</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
The discovery will shed new light on why the Maya "accomplished things no other 
tropical forest society accomplished in the <LOCATION>New World</LOCATION>," <PERSON>Hansen</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
The excavations at <ORGANIZATION>Nakbe</ORGANIZATION>, announced <DATE>Monday</DATE> by <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION>, are "of extraordinary 
importance to our understanding of the origin of Mayan civilization," said 
anthropologist <PERSON>David Friedel</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Southern Methodist University</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The new findings follow on the heels of surprising reports this <DATE>summer</DATE> by 
anthropologist <PERSON>Arthur Demarest</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Vanderbilt University</ORGANIZATION> that the Mayan society 
-- previously believed to be one of history's most peaceful civilizations -- 
collapsed in the <ORGANIZATION>9th Century</ORGANIZATION> AD as the result of internecine warfare. 
</P>
<P>
These new discoveries from the beginning and end of Mayan civilization, <PERSON>Friedel</PERSON> 
added, are "revealing with breathtaking clarity not only their (the Maya's) 
vision of the world, but the breadth and complexity of their political 
organization." 
</P>
<P>
The new find dates from a period when the <ORGANIZATION>Maya</ORGANIZATION> were transforming themselves 
from a centuries-old rural agrarian society to a more sophisticated and complex 
urban society. Researchers are particularly interested in the factors that led 
to this transformation because it sheds light on the more general question of 
how societies are formed. 
</P>
<P>
Although they are not yet sure, the researchers believe that urbanization arose 
as a mechanism to counter the innate hostility of the environment, to promote 
trade, and to consolidate religious and political ideologies. 
</P>
<P>
Nakbe lies in the isolated central department (state) of <LOCATION>Peten</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Guatemala</LOCATION>, 
about 350 miles from <LOCATION>Guatemala City</LOCATION>. The site was first identified as a 
potential location of advanced Mayan civilization in <DATE>1930</DATE> by archeologists 
performing an aerial survey of the region. But no significant work occurred at 
the site until the <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION> team carried out its excavations from <DATE>February</DATE> through 
<DATE>April</DATE> of this year. 
</P>
<P>
That delay arose primarily as a result of the site's isolation. Nakbe "is three 
days on foot from the nearest road," <PERSON>Hansen</PERSON> said. "We used 123 mules to 
transport our stuff in, then kept 14 mules hauling water and supplies for the 
three months we were there. They had to cross swamps and wade through muck up 
to their bellies. It's hard to appreciate the problem if you haven't been 
through it." 
</P>
<P>
But he noted that the isolation probably protected the site from looting. 
</P>
<P>
Their excavations revealed thousands of artifacts, tombs and temple structures, 
some ranging from 40 to 65 feet in height. Other buildings on the site, which 
have not yet been excavated, are estimated to be as tall as 150 feet, which 
would rival pyramids from the more modern Mayan city of <LOCATION>Tikal</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The excavated buildings date from 600 to 400 BC, in the so-called middle 
Pre-Classic period. Previously, the most advanced structures from this period 
to be discovered were crude villages with low stone platforms measuring from 
three to six feet tall. <PERSON>Hansen</PERSON> has not yet dated the taller pyramids. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers also dug up more than 65,000 potsherds, ceramics, human and 
animal figurines, seashells and obsidian and stone tools, which should reveal 
many details about everyday life in this first Mayan city. 
</P>
<P>
They also found an artifact that may prove to be one of the most significant 
Mayan sculptures ever discovered, a 10-foot-high fragmented slab of intricately 
carved limestone erected by Pre-Classic Mayan rulers. It depicts two 
individuals in royal clothing facing each other. One has his hand extended, 
pointing to a deity between them. <PERSON>Hansen</PERSON> believes the stone slab commemorates 
an important historical event whose nature he plans to discuss in a forthcoming 
publication. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Hansen</PERSON> and his colleagues also found the remnants of an even earlier village 
below <LOCATION>Nakbe</LOCATION>, filled with soil and rubble. 
</P>
<P>
"The construction appears to have preserved the village below," <PERSON>Hansen</PERSON> said in 
a telephone interview from his home in <LOCATION>Rupert</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ida</LOCATION>. "It's almost like finding a 
Mayan version of <LOCATION>Pompeii</LOCATION>," the Neapolitan city preserved intact when it was 
buried by an eruption of <ORGANIZATION>Mt. Vesuvius</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The construction of <ORGANIZATION>Nakbe</ORGANIZATION> must have been an enormous task, <PERSON>Hansen</PERSON> said. "All of 
the building materials had to be hauled to the location, rock by rock and 
basket by basket, by hundreds of Mayan workers to construct the massive 
platforms and buildings." 
</P>
<P>
Even drinking water was a problem. During their excavations, the <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION> team 
members had to haul water nearly four miles to the site on mules. "The Maya 
didn't have mules or beasts of burden to do that with," <PERSON>Hansen</PERSON> said. That lack 
led them to develop systems to collect rainwater from the roofs of temples and 
other buildings and channel it into storage facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Another problem that must have impeded construction, <PERSON>Hansen</PERSON> said, is that the 
city was surrounded by swamps. "In order to maintain local trade and exchange, 
they had to construct causeways . . . large, rubble-filled constructions up to 
two yards high and 20 yards wide," he said. 
</P>
<P>
That construction would have allowed them access to neighboring farmlands and 
would have consolidated political authority. 
</P>
<P>
The Maya were unique, <PERSON>Hansen</PERSON> said, because "they were able to achieve the 
greatest level of sophistication in the face of a very hostile environment." 
What researchers are trying to determine, he added, "is why they became 
sophisticated all of a sudden." 
</P>
<P>
The very hostility of the environment may have been a major civilizing 
influence, <PERSON>Hansen</PERSON> speculated. "It was so difficult to live there that it 
required centralized authority to maintain logistics and the life style they 
desired." 
</P>
<P>
Another clue to the civilizing influences was the large amount of seashells and 
obsidian discovered at <LOCATION>Nakbe</LOCATION>, all of which had to be imported from elsewhere. 
<PERSON>Hansen</PERSON> and others speculate that centralized authority was established in part 
to carry out such imports in exchange for a variety of goods, including food, 
chocolate, cotton textiles, forest products, medicines and jaguar pelts. 
</P>
<P>
"Seashells are very important to Maya public ceremonial life," said <ORGANIZATION>SMU</ORGANIZATION>'s 
<PERSON>Friedel</PERSON>. "Great conch shells were used to fashion trumpets that were blown to 
declare the presence of the gods. Small shells were used as little bells and 
tinklers sewn onto the clothes of the elite for public ceremonies." Eventually 
the shells were also used as a form of money. 
</P>
<P>
Obsidian, he added, "was highly prized for ritual bloodletting and was a sacred 
material for all the people of meso-America." 
</P>
<P>
"Another factor, which we are hot on the trail of, is the role of religious 
ideology as an impetus in developing huge cities," <PERSON>Hansen</PERSON> said. The early 
leaders "had a huge control of labor to build these enormous buildings, and it 
appears from our excavations that the sole purpose was ideological. It's not 
funerary; we don't find burials like in later periods." 
</P>
<P>
The buildings did not necessarily serve as churches either, he said. "I'm more 
inclined to think that these buildings were constructed with the idea of 
consolidating the authority of an emerging elite and tying that into religious 
theology. That fits very well with what we know of later Maya mythology, where 
the king became divine and had divine ancestry." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Hansen</PERSON> speculates that it was sometime during the era of <ORGANIZATION>Nakbe</ORGANIZATION>'s construction 
that the authority of kings stopped being earned by achievement and started 
being passed down from fathers to sons. 
</P>
<P>
But solving these riddles, he said, "will take years and years of 
investigation."

<HEAD>Matriarch of San Diego Zoo Elephant Herd Euthanized After Accident</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 51-year-old elephant at the <LOCATION>San Diego Zoo</LOCATION> had
to be killed because of injuries she suffered after falling
headfirst into a concrete moat, officials said.
   Maya, an Asian elephant who was the oldest mammal at the zoo,
apparently suffered torn ligaments in her legs <DATE>Sunday</DATE> as she tried
to climb out of the moat surrounding her enclosure, said zoo
spokesman <PERSON>Jeff Jouett</PERSON>.
   Veterinarians resorted to a fatal dose of sedative when Maya was
unable to stand on her own following a treatment of fluids,
painkillers and steroids.
   ``I counted 27 people there trying to help,'' <PERSON>Jouett</PERSON> said.
``When she would try to rock and stand up, there was a lot of
calling and urging to her.''
   Elephants cannot convalesce while sitting or lying down because
their weight exerts life-threatening pressure on their lungs,
<PERSON>Jouett</PERSON> said.
   <PERSON>Jouett</PERSON> said 51 is fairly elderly for an elephant, but they have
been known to live into their 60s in captivity.
   Maya, who was captured in <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and brought to the zoo <DATE>Nov. 8,
1941</DATE>, was bumped into the moat by another elephant. Two nearby
keepers didn't see the <DATE>fall</DATE> but heard the commotion.
   The 7,100-pound elephant was walking without difficulty in the
moat, but she apparently crippled herself while trying to climb out
on bales of hay that zookeepers set up like steps, <PERSON>Jouett</PERSON> said.
   Maya then was fitted with a harness and lifted by crane into a
sitting position. But it was evident when workers tried to get her
to stand that her legs wouldn't support her, and she was then put
to death.
   Elephants have been knocked into the moat before without
suffering serious injury, but <PERSON>Jouett</PERSON> said <PERSON>Maya</PERSON>'s age may have made
her accident worse. Tests after her death showed she suffered from
degenerative arthritis in her legs.
   He described her as a generally calm, easygoing creature, but
one who often would assert herself to show she still led the herd.
   ``There's some concern over how the remaining four elephants
will react,'' <PERSON>Jouett</PERSON> said. ``They'll notice she's gone and I'm sure
it will be upsetting to them.''
   After the accident, the zoo's <LOCATION>Elephant Mesa</LOCATION> was closed to the
public for the rest of the day.

MAYAS' DEMISE: A WAR WITHIN?; 
</P>
<P>
SITE REVEALS HEAVY FORTIFICATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The mystery of the Maya demise has haunted anthropologists for centuries, but 
researchers may be on the verge of solving the sudden disappearance of one of 
history's most advanced civilizations. 
</P>
<P>
The Maya were "the most sophisticated, literate, complex people in the <LOCATION>New 
World</LOCATION>," according to anthropologist <PERSON>Arthur Demarest</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Vanderbilt University</ORGANIZATION>. 
They erected massive pyramids, created a highly accurate calendar, perfected 
the art of astronomical observation, produced beautiful multicolored pottery 
and intricately carved stone monuments and established widespread trade routes. 
</P>
<P>
But after flourishing throughout much of <LOCATION>Central America</LOCATION> from the 3rd to the 
<DATE>8th Century</DATE>, they all but disappeared in the <ORGANIZATION>9th Century</ORGANIZATION>, dispersing into small 
villages and seemingly losing most of their talents. 
</P>
<P>
Historians and archeologists have long pondered the reasons for this downfall, 
arguing at different times that losses of trade routes, changes in climate, 
endemic disease and many other related factors contributed to their downfall. 
In the past, most of the theories shared the premise that the Mayas were 
largely a peace-loving people who engaged in limited warfare only for 
ritualistic purposes and who met their demise through little fault of their 
own. 
</P>
<P>
But new discoveries made this <DATE>summer</DATE> in the lowlands of <LOCATION>Guatemala</LOCATION> by a team 
headed by <PERSON>Demarest</PERSON> present a sharply different picture of the end of the Maya 
era. Demarest has discovered a heavily fortified Mayan city, called <ORGANIZATION>Punta de 
Chimino</ORGANIZATION>, that is "more massive than a medieval castle" in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
In the nearby city of <LOCATION>Dos Pilas</LOCATION>, he has found hastily erected stoneworks that 
suggest that the city was under heavy siege. These new discoveries, combined 
with previous excavations in the area, indicate that, at the height of the 
Mayan hegemony, the Mayan people were involved in ferocious internecine warfare 
that sapped their vitality and tore apart the fabric of their civilization. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers have few clues yet about what caused the sudden escalation of 
warfare that brought about the end of Mayan civilization -- although some 
evidence suggests the haunting possibility that it was triggered by 
over-exploitation of the environment, deterioration of the soil and pressure on 
food resources. 
</P>
<P>
But even though they do not know why the warfare started, the scientists 
believe they know who started it. Stelae (stone pillars with intricate 
carvings) from <LOCATION>Dos Pilas</LOCATION> identify a leader, known only as Ruler 2 because 
archeologists have not had time to translate his name, "who appears to be one 
of the kings from the beginning of the <ORGANIZATION>8th Century</ORGANIZATION> who embarked on a program of 
territorial conquest," <PERSON>Demarest</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
Based on many recent discoveries of evidence of warfare, especially this 
<DATE>summer</DATE>'s, <PERSON>Demarest</PERSON> has concluded that, for a period of perhaps 50 to 60 years 
beginning about AD 825, warfare spread like a contagion throughout the region. 
Eventually, the economic system collapsed under the weight of the strain 
imposed by the intense combat and defensive measures and individual states 
within the area fell "like dominoes." 
</P>
<P>
By far the most important discovery made this <DATE>summer</DATE> is the <ORGANIZATION>Punta de Chimino</ORGANIZATION> 
site, which sits on a peninsula that juts into <PERSON>Lake Petexbatun</PERSON> in northwestern 
<LOCATION>Guatemala</LOCATION>, four days' journey from <LOCATION>Guatemala City</LOCATION> by plane, Jeep, canoe and 
mule. Researchers had known that a village existed on the site but had not 
explored it. 
</P>
<P>
"We went there to do a survey for a week," <PERSON>Demarest</PERSON> said by telephone from 
<LOCATION>Antigua</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Guatemala</LOCATION>, where he has been recuperating from pneumonia and the 
parasitic diseases that are the bane of archeologists. The 36-year-old <PERSON>Demarest</PERSON> 
is the leader of a team of several American and Guatemalan archeologists, a 
dozen <ORGANIZATION>Vanderbilt</ORGANIZATION> graduate students and 50 Guatemalan workers that has been 
granted an exclusive permit by the Guatemalan government to dig up hundreds of 
square miles of the Mayan heartland in the <LOCATION>Peten</LOCATION> jungle. The <MONEY>$1-million</MONEY> project 
is funded by the <ORGANIZATION>National Geographic Society</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>H. F. Guggenheim Peace 
Foundation</ORGANIZATION> and the largest archeological grant ever awarded by the <ORGANIZATION>National 
Endowment</ORGANIZATION> for the Humanities. 
</P>
<P>
Punta de Chimino "was not a very important component of our work," <PERSON>Demarest</PERSON> 
said. But what they found there made them change their plans instantly. 
</P>
<P>
The Mayas who lived in <LOCATION>Punta</LOCATION> de Chimino excavated a massive ditch, 450 feet 
long and 50 feet deep, that cut the city off from the mainland, making it 
completely surrounded by water. In excavating the ditch through bedrock, 
<PERSON>Demarest</PERSON> said, the <LOCATION>Mayas</LOCATION> moved three times as much rock and stone as had been 
used to construct the city itself. "It's as if the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> were spending 
<PERCENT>75%</PERCENT> of its budget on defense," he said. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Punta de Chimino</ORGANIZATION> also had walls around its sides to protect it from attacks by 
canoes, and protected portages through which food could be brought in during a 
siege. "One of the reasons people have used to argue that Mayans were not 
warlike was the fact that their centers were completely indefensible," he said. 
"This is the exact opposite of that." 
</P>
<P>
Inside the walls of <ORGANIZATION>Punta de Chimino</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Demarest</PERSON> found "a kind of shrunken Mayan 
state. It has all the characteristics of a Mayan ceremonial center, but on a 
smaller scale." Included were a single ball court (the Mayas played a sort of 
hybrid between soccer and basketball with great intensity; losers were 
sometimes sacrificed), one temple, one funerary, one set of stairways with 
hieroglyphics, and so on. 
</P>
<P>
The fortress also had a large open area within the innermost wall that could 
have been used as a refuge for the population from the mainland. 
</P>
<P>
"It would have been almost impossible to take the place. It was really 
impregnable," <PERSON>Demarest</PERSON> said. "Those are terms you don't normally use in 
discussing Mayan architecture." 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Punta de Chimino</ORGANIZATION> is "probably one of the few sites where the stereotype of 
archeology is accurate," he said. "It's like <PERSON>Indiana Jones</PERSON> and the Temple of 
Doom." 
</P>
<P>
At nearby <PERSON>Dos Pilas</PERSON>, evidence of a different kind also suggests a sudden 
intensification of warfare. Dos Pilas is the classic, indefensible Mayan city, 
in the middle of the jungle with ready access from all sides. But sometime 
toward the end of the <ORGANIZATION>8th Century</ORGANIZATION>, the inhabitants of Dos Pilas erected two 
concentric rings of walls around the center of the city, defacing monuments and 
burying important artifacts in their haste. 
</P>
<P>
Debris recovered from inside the walls indicates that large numbers of people 
inhabited the area at least briefly, suggesting that the city was under siege. 
When and how it fell, however, is still a mystery. 
</P>
<P>
But before it did, Ruler 2 apparently conquered a number of smaller fortresses. 
</P>
<P>
Demarest and his colleagues also discovered, but have only tentatively 
explored, an extensive series of caves near <LOCATION>Dos Pilas</LOCATION> that have not been 
entered by humans for more than 1,000 years. He believes that the caves may 
also have been used as a place of refuge during a siege. 
</P>
<P>
In one of the caves, they discovered ritual offerings of broken pots and flint 
knives, as well as the mummified remains of a boy who had been sacrificed and 
painted with red ocher. Exploring the unexpected caves "was one of the first 
times I've found myself irrationally exhilarated," <PERSON>Demarest</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
Demarest's discoveries are so recent that few of his colleagues, aside from 
those on the expedition itself, are aware of them. One who has been informed is 
anthropologist <PERSON>Richard E. W. Adams</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>University of Texas</ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION>San Antonio</LOCATION>, 
who thinks <PERSON>Demarest</PERSON>'s discoveries are "swell stuff." 
</P>
<P>
The new discoveries, <PERSON>Adams</PERSON> said, "go a long way toward documenting in detail 
this whole business of warfare as an element in the collapse of the Mayan 
civilization." 
</P>
<P>
Archeologists' picture of the Mayan civilization has been gradually changing 
over the <DATE>last 20 years</DATE>. Historians of Mayan art, in particular, had begun to 
paint a picture of a more warlike population than had been previously believed. 
</P>
<P>
Mayan hieroglyphics show repeated images of warriors clad in jaguar pelts or 
bird-like costumes, bearing woven shields and lances, capturing the noble elite 
of nearby tribes and bringing them back to their own temples for ritualistic 
bloodletting, removal of their hearts and decapitation. 
</P>
<P>
But this war was sharply circumscribed. Mayan art shows no instances of cities 
under siege, temples ransacked, or any of the other depredations of large-scale 
conflict. Instead, the fighting seems to be representative more of a rite of 
passage for prestige than an actual combat for resources or plunder. 
</P>
<P>
But about AD 825, <PERSON>Adams</PERSON> said, "something went terribly wrong" and kings like 
Ruler 2 began actual conquest of nearby cities and settlements. By the middle 
of that century, <LOCATION>Dos Pilas</LOCATION> had extended its hegemony to cover an area of nearly 
690 square miles -- a huge amount of land in comparison to the areas controlled 
by other Mayan cities -- before it ultimately collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
"But if one group changes the rules (of warfare), other groups have to adopt 
the new rules and you get a kind of arms race," <PERSON>Demarest</PERSON> said. "Intensification 
of warfare spreads by contagion, and the ultimate result can be regional 
devastation. In this case, the Dos Pilas hegemony broke up into heavily 
fortified sites, small independent states warring rather savagely with each 
other. It may not be the principal cause of the collapse of the Mayan 
civilization, but it is certainly a principal cause."

<P>
<PERSON>Teresa Soria</PERSON> was taking out the trash <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME> when a little boy 
wearing blue pajamas ran across the street with tears in his eyes begging for 
help. 
</P>
<P>
"My mother is laying on the floor," the boy said, trembling. "There is blood 
all over." 
</P>
<P>
Soria sent him to another neighbor who, after peering into the living room of 
the home in the <DATE>6700</DATE> block of Arbutus Street in <LOCATION>Huntington Park</LOCATION>, gathered up 
the 8-year-old boy, and his younger brother and sister, and called police. 
Officers arrived to discover the brutal murder of <PERSON>Bertha Gomez</PERSON>, 31, who was 
shot while her children slept. 
</P>
<P>
The crime has brought terror to the tidy neighborhood of Spanish-style homes, 
whose residents had considered themselves somehow immune to a surge in murders 
in the surrounding community. 
</P>
<P>
In a town that has but four homicide detectives, it has also stretched the 
resources of a 60-member police force already overwhelmed with an alarming 
number of mostly gang- and drug-related violent crimes -- including 27 drive-by 
shootings since <DATE>January</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
The number of serious crimes, including murder, rape and auto theft, has risen 
from 3,406 incidents in <DATE>1985</DATE> to 4,968 in <DATE>1989</DATE> -- an increase of <PERCENT>31.5%</PERCENT>, police 
spokesman <PERSON>Tom Weselis</PERSON> said <DATE>Thursday</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had nine homicides in five months, compared with 12 all last year," he 
said. "Our guys are busier than hell, running nonstop from crime to crime to 
crime." 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, patrol officers have been working 65-hour weeks in an effort to keep 
up with an increase in calls for assistance in the three-square-mile city of 
70,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
"My phones are ringing all the time from people wanting to organize 
Neighborhood Watch programs, because they don't want to be the next victim," 
<PERSON>Weselis</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
Police and city officials blame the problem on the fact that the <ORGANIZATION>Police 
Department</ORGANIZATION> has not expanded along with the population over the last five years. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to beef up the force, the city plans to use more than <MONEY>a million 
dollars</MONEY> in cash seized in local drug busts to hire five new officers. "Five is 
not enough, but it will help," <PERSON>Weselis</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
The latest murder followed a double homicide on <DATE>Feb. 27</DATE>, in which two robbers 
broke into a <LOCATION>Huntington Park</LOCATION> condominium and terrorized six members of a family 
for hours before killing a pregnant woman and her 8-month-old fetus. Two 
suspects were arrested in late <DATE>March</DATE> after two investigators put in a total of 
260 hours tracking leads and evaluating evidence, including fingerprints lifted 
at the crime scene. 
</P>
<P>
In the <PERSON>Gomez</PERSON> case, investigators also "have lots of leads" and believe that the 
woman may have been killed by members of an "auto insurance fraud ring" that 
she knew, Detective <PERSON>Steve Hess</PERSON> said. He declined to elaborate on the possible 
motivation for the slaying. 
</P>
<P>
"We have three suspects in mind, none of whom wore gloves when they ransacked 
the house," <PERSON>Hess</PERSON> said. "We also have the bullet in the victim's brain, which we 
can compare with a murder weapon." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, <PERSON>Gomez</PERSON>'s 8-year-old son "was very strong, very alert and able to 
give us a strong, accurate and consistent account of what happened," the 
detective said. 
</P>
<P>
The boy told investigators that three masked men entered the house about <TIME>8 p.m.</TIME> 
<DATE>Tuesday</DATE>. One of them carried a handgun and another had a knife. One of the men, 
in <LOCATION>Spanish</LOCATION>, ordered the children to go to bed. The boy and the two other 
children, ages 2 and <DATE>5</DATE>, did as they were told, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The oldest child awoke <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME> about <TIME>8 a.m.</TIME> and found his mother's 
body. About <TIME>15 minutes later</TIME>, he told neighbors that "we've been robbed and my 
mother has blood in her mouth." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the evidence in the case, many residents have been unable to sleep 
since word spread along tree-lined Arbutus Street that the shy, introverted 
woman was found bound and gagged on the floor of her bedroom with a gunshot 
wound in her head. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't understand why it happened here," neighbor <PERSON>Jaime Maya</PERSON>, 23, said 
<DATE>Thursday</DATE>. "Everybody around here grew up together. We wave to each other on the 
street. It's been peaceful. 
</P>
<P>
"I never thought I'd buy a gun," <PERSON>Maya</PERSON> added. "But this has opened my eyes." 
</P>
<P>
A few doors down, <PERSON>Marina Acosta</PERSON>, a 40-year-old mother of two teen-agers, said 
she has been sleeping on the living room couch because she is afraid to stay in 
her bedroom at night. 
</P>
<P>
"When someone knocks on the door I'm afraid to open it," <PERSON>Acosta</PERSON> said, studying 
the occupants of every vehicle that passed the home she has lived in for 17 
years. "I'm thinking about moving to another block." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to live here anymore either, but where can you run?" wondered 
another neighbor, who asked that her named not be used. "We're going to have to 
grin and bear it."

<HEAD>Mexico Trims Price of Light Crude for U.S. Customers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>, the world's sixth largest oil
producer, last month trimmed the average price of its light Isthmus
crude to <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> clients, the government oil monopoly said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>
<TIME>night</TIME>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Pemex</ORGANIZATION> said in a statement that it charged <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> customers an
average of <MONEY>$15.78</MONEY> for a 42-gallon barrel in <DATE>May</DATE>, down from the <MONEY>$16</MONEY>
of <DATE>April</DATE>.
   The average price of heavy Maya oil rose from <MONEY>$12.77</MONEY> a barrel in
<DATE>April</DATE> to <MONEY>$13.07</MONEY> in <DATE>May</DATE>, the statement said.
   ``The Isthmus- and Maya-quality crudes that <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> exported
during the month of <DATE>May</DATE> to the American continent had a light
variation in their quotations, with respect to <DATE>April</DATE>, due to the
linkage of the prices of Mexican oil with the prevailing ones in
the international market,'' <ORGANIZATION>Pemex</ORGANIZATION> said.
   Prices for Japanese buyers were held steady in <DATE>May</DATE> at <MONEY>$15.30</MONEY> a
barrel for the light oil and <MONEY>$12.60</MONEY> a barrel for the heavy brand.
   European customers paid less last month. <ORGANIZATION>Pemex</ORGANIZATION> said those
clients were charged on average <MONEY>$14.99</MONEY> a barrel for Isthmus crude
during the first 15 days of <DATE>May</DATE> and <MONEY>$12.15</MONEY> for the Maya quality. In
<DATE>April</DATE>, the average cost for <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> was <MONEY>$15.43</MONEY> a barrel for Isthmus
and <MONEY>$12.51</MONEY> for <ORGANIZATION>Maya</ORGANIZATION>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Pemex</ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> exported an average of <MONEY>1.357 million barrels</MONEY> a
day in <DATE>May</DATE>, with <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> buyers taking <PERCENT>51 percent</PERCENT> of the total.
   <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> bought <PERCENT>21 percent</PERCENT> of the total, and <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> was the third
largest buyer, with a <PERCENT>15 percent</PERCENT> share.
   <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> is not a member of the <ORGANIZATION>Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries</ORGANIZATION>, a 13-member cartel, but it monitors its
decisions closely and often follows its guidelines on pricing and
production.
   <ORGANIZATION>OPEC</ORGANIZATION> members are scheduled to hold their regular mid-year
meeting in <LOCATION>Vienna</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Austria</LOCATION>, on <DATE>Saturday</DATE>. They are expected to focus
their attention on whether to overhaul production quotas.
   Mexico and five other non-cartel nations earlier this year held
talks with <ORGANIZATION>OPEC</ORGANIZATION> about reducing output in an effort to bolster
sagging world prices.
   <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>, which has a foreign debt of about <MONEY>$100 billion</MONEY>, relies
on its oil sales to help keep current on its loan payments and buy
needed imports for its developing economy.
   President <ORGANIZATION>Miguel de la Madrid</ORGANIZATION> has in recent years pushed to
reduce the nation's dependence on crude exports and build up sales
of non-oil goods to foreign buyers.

MAYAN CULTURE FINDS A HAVEN; 
</P>
<P>
TRADITIONS: L.A.'S IXIM CENTER PROMOTES COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT AND CULTURAL 
EXPRESSION OF MAYAN REFUGEES FROM CENTRAL AMERICA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By KEVIN BAXTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Once home to elegant restaurants and apartments, the streets of the <ORGANIZATION>Pico-Union 
District</ORGANIZATION> are now tired and unkept. Wrought iron guards many of the storefronts 
and weeds have overrun the spaces that concrete and trash have missed. 
</P>
<P>
It's a stark contrast to the lush green mountains and verdant countryside of 
<LOCATION>Central America</LOCATION>, yet the neighborhood has become home to the greatest 
concentration of Salvadorans outside <LOCATION>El Salvador</LOCATION> and the largest number of 
Guatemalans outside <LOCATION>Guatemala</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
These refugees, victims of war and poverty, plant their dreams in the cement 
and hope for the best. For <PERSON>Samuel Simon</PERSON>, the ground has proved fertile. 
</P>
<P>
"Here there are many opportunities, and if I put my mind to it, I can succeed," 
he says. 
</P>
<P>
In <PERSON>Simon</PERSON>'s homeland, <LOCATION>Guatemala</LOCATION>, the outlook was much bleaker. A Mayan Indian, 
<PERSON>Simon</PERSON> watched a succession of governments rob his people of their language, 
tradition and culture before fleeing 3 1/2 years ago in advance of a forced 
recruitment sweep by the army. 
</P>
<P>
"The only reason I left," he says, "is fear." 
</P>
<P>
And among the reasons he stays is culture. Although Mayan customs have been 
forcibly repressed in <LOCATION>Guatemala</LOCATION> since the time of the Spanish Conquest, they 
have found a home in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
IXIM, the center for the integration of indigenous Mayas, was founded more than 
a decade ago to promote the community development and cultural expression of 
<ORGANIZATION>Maya</ORGANIZATION> refugees. IXIM (pronounced ee-SHEEM) takes its name from the Mayan word 
for corn, which, according to folk tradition, was the substance used by the 
Gods to create the first Mayans. 
</P>
<P>
Simon, 24, is the secretary of IXIM as well as the director of the center's 
most visible component, its marimba band. The group will perform as part of the 
<LOCATION>Los Angeles Festival</LOCATION> on <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, from <TIME>12:45 p.m.</TIME> until 1:30 next to the La 
Placita church in Olvera Street, and again from 3 until <TIME>5 p.m.</TIME> at <ORGANIZATION>Union 
Station</ORGANIZATION>. Both concerts are free. 
</P>
<P>
Although descendants of the ancient Mayan civilizations are often lumped 
together, they represent 23 distinct groups and 100 dialects in <LOCATION>Guatemala</LOCATION> 
alone. The majority of Mayans in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> speak languages of the 
Q'anjob'alan subfamily, which dominates the highland regions of the <ORGANIZATION>Department 
of Huehuetenango</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Simon, a <ORGANIZATION>Kanjobal Mayan</ORGANIZATION>, comes from the city of <LOCATION>Santa Eulalia</LOCATION> in western 
<LOCATION>Huehuetenango</LOCATION>, less than 30 miles from the Mexican border. There he worked as a 
teacher, a profession that earned him the respect of his people and the 
suspicion of his government. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a campaign to knock off the Indians' leaders . . . the teachers and 
such," says Father <PERSON>James Curtain</PERSON>, the Catholic priest who founded IXIM in <DATE>1979</DATE> 
after more than three decades of work among the indigenous peoples of 
<LOCATION>Guatemala</LOCATION>. Curtain, 71, now lives at the <ORGANIZATION>Maryknoll Residence</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Los Altos</LOCATION>, 
south of <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"All the Indians are considered subversives by the military," <PERSON>Curtain</PERSON> said. 
"There is general repression against the Indians." 
</P>
<P>
The repression turned to genocide under the military rule of generals <PERSON>Romeo 
Lucas Garcia</PERSON> (1978-82) and <PERSON>Efrain Rios Montt</PERSON> (1982-83), who unleashed a brutal 
counterinsurgency campaign in the countryside. Ostensibly, it was intended to 
give the army the upper hand in its long war against anti-government 
guerrillas. But in reality, it led to the massacre of more than 50,000 
indigenous Guatemalans and forced hundreds of thousands more into exile, 
according to a study by a branch of the <ORGANIZATION>Guatemalan Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Traditional culture has also been a casualty of war. Out of fear, many Mayan 
women no longer wear the traditional and colorful huipil dresses, which reveal 
their Indian roots. And children are taught Spanish at home rather than their 
native dialect to help them blend in. 
</P>
<P>
According to <LOCATION>Curtain</LOCATION>, that leaves most indigenous Guatemalans "stuck in a kind 
of in-between place -- afraid to be recognized as an Indians, but not accepted 
by the others. 
</P>
<P>
"Our big job," he said, "is to get them to be proud of their culture and their 
heritage. To be proud of what they are. To preserve their culture." 
</P>
<P>
It's a task <PERSON>Samuel Simon</PERSON> has accepted with fervor. The son of a musician, <PERSON>Simon</PERSON> 
learned to play marimba at the age of 6. That talent, combined with his skill 
as a teacher, made <PERSON>Simon</PERSON> the obvious choice to teach and direct IXIM's five 
marimbistas. 
</P>
<P>
The marimba -- as common in highland <LOCATION>Guatemala</LOCATION> as a piano or guitar in the 
<LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> -- has an important place in Mayan tradition. For centuries it 
has been central to both religious and social celebrations. In areas such as 
<LOCATION>Huehuetenango</LOCATION>, where <PERCENT>85%</PERCENT> of the people are descendants of the <ORGANIZATION>Maya</ORGANIZATION>, marimba 
bands have traditionally traveled from town to town to play in local fiestas. 
If the band is good, the status of its villages grows; if a band is bad, the 
village can be disgraced. 
</P>
<P>
Simon's village, <LOCATION>Santa Eulalia</LOCATION>, is a hotbed for marimba players, among them 
<PERSON>Simon</PERSON>'s father. But like most Guatemalan marimbistas, <PERSON>Simon</PERSON> never learned to 
read music. Instead, he plays by ear, learning new tunes by memorizing the 
music from cassettes. 
</P>
<P>
"Music is a gift I have," he says. "Here, I don't have many other interests. 
Playing the marimba is the only thing." 
</P>
<P>
Even so, <PERSON>Simon</PERSON> has precious little time to devote to his music. Like the other 
members of IXIM's band, he works every day but <DATE>Sunday</DATE> in a garment district 
shop where, in a good week, he will make <MONEY>$200</MONEY>. He also spends two nights a week 
at a trade school studying to be a radio announcer. 
</P>
<P>
Simon already has a radio show of his own, broadcasting in Spanish twice weekly 
to parts of <LOCATION>San Bernardino</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Riverside</LOCATION>. Ironically, the commercial music he 
plays on the radio is one of the obstacles he says immigrants face in trying to 
preserve their culture in a new country. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes modernization changes the roots of a culture," he says. "It would be 
similar to us forgetting our culture. But with (IXIM), it's different because 
we practice our culture like it was before. We change nothing. It's important 
that we conserve the Mayan and <LOCATION>Kanjobal</LOCATION> culture so that people can know it." 
</P>
<P>
Simon, who fled <LOCATION>Guatemala</LOCATION> with his uncle and entered this country illegally, 
lives with six other men in a small house in the shadow of the Harbor Freeway. 
His immediate future depends on the outcome of his political asylum request, 
which is still pending with the <ORGANIZATION>INS</ORGANIZATION>. The odds for a favorable review, however, 
are long -- less than <PERCENT>3%</PERCENT> of those Guatemalans seeking political asylum won 
their cases last year, despite overwhelming evidence that government-sponsored 
repression continues. 
</P>
<P>
"It's worse," <PERSON>Curtain</PERSON> says. "Anybody that protests against what's going on is 
in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps more ominous is the fact that retired general <PERSON>Rios Montt</PERSON>, an architect 
of the Mayan holocaust, is running for the presidency as a civilian. Elections 
are scheduled for <DATE>November</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
With prospects for the future so dim, it would seem difficult to remain 
optimistic. Yet <PERSON>Simon</PERSON>, displaying a stoicism typical of the Mayans, says he has 
few regrets. 
</P>
<P>
"I have made many sacrifices, but I have everything," he says. "I feel much 
stronger about my culture here than there. I feel more <LOCATION>Kanjobal</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"There are more possibilities here to practice my culture. There are 
possibilities here than I ever knew existed. 
</P>
<P>
"If the <ORGANIZATION>INS</ORGANIZATION> gives my asylum, I'll stay. If not, I'll go back."

FT  23 OCT 93 / Arts: Marvellous monsters from Mexico - From the Oltecs to
Frida Kahlo, Patricia Morison finds them all in Belgium at the Europalia 93
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FROM <LOCATION>Antwerp</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Zonhoven</LOCATION>, cultural events with a Mexican accent spatter the
map of <LOCATION>Belgium</LOCATION> from now until <DATE>Christmas</DATE>. <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> is the title of
Europalia 93. Events span the conventional arts and go beyond to include
horsemanship, numismatics, literature (presided over by <PERSON>Octavio Paz</PERSON> and
<PERSON>Carlos Fuentes</PERSON>), and papel picado or paper-cutting. Free to all comers is an
seven-day linguistics seminar on Mexican Spanish at <LOCATION>Antwerp</LOCATION>.
But what is Europalia? The unkind answer would be, a Belgian arts festival
which leaves the French cold and blank looks from most culturally aware
Britons. Yet Europalia has quite a pedigree. It was set up in <DATE>1969</DATE> as a
non-profit making, multi-disciplinary biennial arts festival to provide a
cultural window onto the member states of the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION>. In <DATE>1989</DATE>, it drew 1,660,000
visitors. A measure of devolution has crept in and events now spill over to
<LOCATION>Maastricht</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Rotterdam</LOCATION>, even <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>.
Certain EC countries have yet to take the stage - <LOCATION>Luxemburg</LOCATION> for one, <LOCATION>Ireland</LOCATION>
for another. In <DATE>1989</DATE>, <LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION> declined on grounds of expense (her turn came
in <DATE>1991</DATE>). The foundation's invitation to <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> threw Europalia open to all
comers; <LOCATION>Scandinavia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Turkey</LOCATION> currently contend for the <DATE>1995</DATE> slot.
Staging Europalia is not cheap. <LOCATION>Belgium</LOCATION> covers all costs within the country,
the guest nation pays the rest. This year, <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>'s costs were approximately
Dollars 20 million while <LOCATION>Belgium</LOCATION>'s were roughly half, which is the standard
proportion. Where formerly there was a plethora of sponsors, this year, in
addition to the <ORGANIZATION>National Lottery</ORGANIZATION>, the Belgian end has six 'structural'
sponsors, each contributing BFr10 million: <ORGANIZATION>Alcatel Bell</ORGANIZATION>, Batiments et <ORGANIZATION>Ponts
Construction</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Bekaert</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Belgacom</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Generale de Banque</ORGANIZATION>, and Swift.
So much for the Europalian nuts and bolts. In my own area of the visual
arts, <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> has fielded some sumptuous exhibitions and others which sound
promising but I had no time to see. Sinister and heavy with the reek of
blood, Mayan archaeology is the festival's glory. Two large exhibitions must
be seen; The Eagle and the Sun, at the Palais des Beaux-Arts until <DATE>December
19</DATE>, and Maya-Metropolis at the <ORGANIZATION>Musees Royaux</ORGANIZATION> d'Art et d'Histoire in
<LOCATION>Cinquantenaire Park</LOCATION> until <DATE>December 24</DATE>.
A statue out of a nightmare, lifesize on a high plinth, stands guardian to
'The Eagle and the Sun'. It is made out of modelled and cast sections of
blackish-red like a ghastly mechanical toy. A human torso and legs balance
on feet with triple talons curved upwards. The face and huge ears of this
god of <LOCATION>Oaxaca</LOCATION> are clearly those of a bat. With its gaping mouth and four
great canine teeth, there seems every reason to believe that the three clay
bells on its neck sounded the death-knell for human sacrifices.
'Anthropomorphised mouse, Zapotec culture' is as far as the label goes and
the catalogue, beautifully photographed though it is, is not much more
informative. This is not an exhibition which seems to want to instruct its
public nor is it stylishly displayed. Yet despite this, the show is a
memorable introduction to pre-Columbian art.
It aims to be more, the theme being 3,000 years of Mexican art from the
Oltecs (1200-600 BC) to <PERSON>Frida Kahlo</PERSON>. However, <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> after its conquest by
<PERSON>Hernan Cortes</PERSON> in <DATE>1521</DATE>, is on the whole only thinly evoked with certain
exceptions from <LOCATION>New Spain</LOCATION>. My favourites were a remarkable 17th-century
painted genealogy of the family of <PERSON>Mendoza Moctezuma</PERSON> and four paintings by
<PERSON>Miguel Cabrera</PERSON> in the genre of scenes illustrating <LOCATION>New Spain</LOCATION>'s rigid caste
system.
The pre-Columbian rooms are surely where you will want to linger. More than
100 pieces have been sent by museums all over <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>, for the most part
sculptures, some of them large and of superb quality. A number of the best
pieces stand free of glass cases like the vampire-god, which increases the
almost palpable air of menace.
Many figures peer through rings strangely like spectacles or have skin
welted by snaking cicatrices. Some of the more human creatures sit on the
ground, cross-legged or hunched. Warriors, priests, or victims, they serve
gods who stand four-square under their plumed head-dresses displaying the
emblems of divinity, eagles, serpents, the skulls which to this day are
omnipresent in Mexican folk-art.
A statue of a god of the Totonacs clasps a severed head by a handle as if it
were his handbag. He comes from the <LOCATION>Gulf of Mexico</LOCATION> and belongs to the
centuries equivalent to <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>'s Gothic age. To form a picture of which
peoples were active when, Maya-Metropolis is the far and away the better
show, a survey of the Mayan city-states from the Yucatan to the Nicaraguan
frontier in the classical and post-classical period (200-1500AD).
The aim is to show how distinct these city-states were. Anyone not reading
French (or Dutch) is at a disadvantage although the show has a a clear
lay-out. Essentially it is one large space mapped chronologically into
city-states - <LOCATION>Bonampak</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Jaina</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Chichen Itza</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Palenque</LOCATION>, and so on. Stylish
design puts stepped details and turquoise decoration everywhere to suggest
Mayan temples.
Astonishing and even beautiful things are in the show. Highly carved
figurines from <LOCATION>Jaina</LOCATION>, the island necropolis, have jointed limbs and
detachable shields for the warriors, like Action Man dolls, as well as
figures such as old women and hunchbacks who have much to tell
archaeologists about Mayan society. Here is the show to discover the Mayans'
incredible skill at using primitive means to carve obsidian and jade.
The catalogue, clear and readable, will give you the latest from the bloody
Mayan battlefield, whether the hieroglyphs really can be read (yes is the
answer). My world is the richer for learning that jade comes from Spanish
for 'stone of the kidneys', ijada, because the conquerors followed Mexican
practice in taking powdered jade as a medicine. No doubt that was the fate
of many fabulously carved necklaces such as stout <PERSON>Cortes</PERSON> gave his marquesa
on their betrothal. See also the very fine pre-Columbian rooms at the
Cinquantenaire museum which reopened <DATE>last week</DATE> after four years.
A smaller exhibition I liked is Crucible of Hope at the <ORGANIZATION>BBL</ORGANIZATION> headquarters,
place Royal 6. A survey of Mexican history from <DATE>1810</DATE> to <DATE>1910</DATE>, it surveys a
century of revolution. The Belgian link is poignantly presented, less in the
person of <LOCATION>Empress Charlotte</LOCATION> who, I learnt, was an insanely ambitious woman
who forced poor <PERSON>Maximilian</PERSON> to accept the throne, than in the story of the
Belgian volunteers who left from <LOCATION>Oudenaarde</LOCATION> to defend their princess.
Ghent has a superb exhibition of silver, mostly religious, from <LOCATION>New Spain</LOCATION> in
the fine new galleries of the Museum vor Sierkunst; and shows elsewhere
explore popular art through masks, Day of the Dead paraphernalia, and the
muralists. For a Europalia catalogue, ring 071 629 0230.

<TEXT>
   Deep in a mangrove swamp near the <LOCATION>Gulf of
Mexico</LOCATION>, archaeologists have discovered traces of what could be
another ancient Mexican civilization.
   So far, the only clues to these mysterious people are a four-ton
stele, or stone slab, covered with hieroglyphic writing and a
19-inch-high clay figure of a fertility-rite priest.
   ``But,'' says <PERSON>Fernando Winfield Capitaine</PERSON>, director of the
<ORGANIZATION>Xalapa Museum of Anthropology</ORGANIZATION>, ``the finds are so promising that
the museum is planning to mount an expedition to that area of
<LOCATION>Veracruz</LOCATION> state in cooperation with the <ORGANIZATION>National Geographic
Society</ORGANIZATION>.''
   The stele was found in <DATE>November 1986</DATE>. It is covered with
inscriptions in an unknown language but with some Mayan numerals.
   The priest in the clay figure is wearing the human skin of a
flayed sacrificial victim.
   Both are about 1,800 years old.
   ``That would place them in the <DATE>second century A.D.</DATE>, which is
after the archaeological Olmecs, who flourished in the area from
around <DATE>1050</DATE> to 500 B.C., and before the Mayas who emerged around
the fourth century A.D,'' <PERSON>Winfield</PERSON> said in an interview.
   Adding to the intrigue, the Mayas lived in the <LOCATION>Yucatan
Peninsula</LOCATION>, more than 700 miles to the east, <PERSON>Winfield</PERSON> said at the
museum in <LOCATION>Xalapa</LOCATION>, where the stele and figure are kept.
   ``But there are two dates on the stele in Mayan writing, in
their so-called Long Count Calendar made up of dots and bars,
equivalent to <DATE>May 22</DATE>, 143 (A.D.), and <DATE>July 13</DATE>, 156 A.D.,'' <PERSON>Winfield</PERSON>
said.
   If the mysterious people did exist, <PERSON>Winfield</PERSON> said, they also
appeared to be unrelated to the other two of the four known
civilizations that inhabited the gulf coast: the Totonacas, who
emerged around the seventh century <LOCATION>A.D.</LOCATION> in the area where the
artifacts were found, or the Huaxtecas farther north, about one
century later.
   ``They could be the Xicalancas, of which Clavijero briefly
talked about,'' <PERSON>Winfield</PERSON> said, referring to the Rev. <PERSON>Francisco
Javier Francisco Javier Clavijero</PERSON> (1731-1787), a Jesuit priest who
was the first to systematically study <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>'s ancient languages
and peoples.
   In his ``History of Ancient Mexico,'' Clavijero in three lines
briefly mentioned the Xicalanca civilization in relation to the
Olmecs, but did not go into details.
   In ``nahuatl,'' the trading language of the Aztecs, who came
much later, Xicalanca means ``the people who live by the Great Body
of Salt Water,'' as the <LOCATION>Gulf of Mexico</LOCATION> was called.
   The two artifacts were found within 130 feet of each other in
the village of <LOCATION>La Mojarra</LOCATION>, where the <LOCATION>Piojo River</LOCATION> meets the <LOCATION>Acula
River</LOCATION>. The crocodile-infested region is so swampy that it can be
reached only by boat, <ORGANIZATION>Winfield</ORGANIZATION> said.
   La Mojarra, with a population of fewer than 200, is up the <LOCATION>Acula</LOCATION>
about 20 miles south of the port of Alvarado in <LOCATION>Veracruz</LOCATION> state. But
neither the village nor the <LOCATION>Piojo River</LOCATION> can be found on any map of
<LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>.
   Carved in relief on the previously polished stele, which is of
basalt, one of the world's hardest rocks, is the full length
profile of a regal figure, a man about 25 years old, holding out in
both hands a vessel in a gesture of offering.
   ``He was probably a ruler, or a chief warrior, or a high priest
_ or maybe all three since that was the custom in the gulf region
in ancient times,'' <PERSON>Winfield</PERSON> said.
   The figure wears ear-stops, a tall headdress adorned with four
representations of something like a rain god, trimmed with eight
feathers, and a breastplate full of other allegorical figures over
what appears to be a pleated cotton shirt or tunic.
   A total of 577 glyphs, or picture-words, divided into 21 neat
rows running from top to bottom, plus 33 ``elements'' like the
rain-god representations, cover the rest of the slab.
   ``It was all carved during one continuous period,'' <PERSON>Winfield</PERSON>
said. ``It was a single piece of work. It is the oldest and richest
piece of writing found yet about this area of ancient <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>.''
   About 7 feet tall, slightly oblong and with a gently rounded
top, the stele once stood on the right bank of the Acula, just
outside La Mojarra.
   Over the years, erosion toppled it, and it lay in the river
until a fisherman discovered it and dragged it out with the help of
villagers.
   Archaeologists retrieved the stele, but <PERSON>Winfield</PERSON> said he kept
the find quiet for two years so work could proceed ``without the
pressure that such a discovery creates.''
   The second piece, the ceramic figure of a priest made with the
region's thick orange clay, has a square base. It is the only one
of two artifacts from that area with a base. The other, also in the
museum, is so badly damaged it cannot be studied, <ORGANIZATION>Winfield</ORGANIZATION> said.
   In the La Mojarra figure, only the head is missing.
   That type of clay figure was very popular among the four gulf
cultures. The Aztecs called it in Xipe Totec, or the Lord of the
Flayed, and it was variously worshiped as the god of <DATE>spring</DATE>, of
fertility, of abundance and of the metalworkers.
   A peasant at La Mojarra found the shattered figure many years
ago while digging the foundations for his house and kept the pieces
in a cardboard box.
   ``We got wind of it three weeks ago, and we convinced him to let
the museum have it,'' <PERSON>Winfield</PERSON> said.
   Winfield suspects the La Mojarra area could have been a
ceremonial site.
   ``If so, there surely must be more stele and artifacts to be
found,'' he said.

<HEAD>Mexican Oil Prices Increase Average $2 a Barrel in December</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mexican oil prices rose an average of more
than <MONEY>$2</MONEY> a barrel in <DATE>December</DATE> in the wake of the new <ORGANIZATION>OPEC</ORGANIZATION> quota
agreement, the government oil monopoly <ORGANIZATION>Pemex</ORGANIZATION> said.
   The price of light Isthmus crude in the <LOCATION>Americas</LOCATION> was <MONEY>$13.93</MONEY> a
barrel in <DATE>December</DATE>, an increase from <MONEY>$11.62</MONEY> in <DATE>November</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Petroleos
Mexicanos</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>late Thursday</DATE>.
   The heavy Maya grade sold for <MONEY>$10.52</MONEY> a barrel, compared with
<MONEY>$9.21</MONEY> a month earlier, and the extra-light Olmeca for <MONEY>$15.24</MONEY>, up
from <MONEY>$12.90</MONEY>.
   Customers in the <LOCATION>Far East</LOCATION> paid <MONEY>$12.95</MONEY> a barrel for Isthmus and
<MONEY>$10.30</MONEY> a barrel for <ORGANIZATION>Maya</ORGANIZATION>, increases from <MONEY>$10.82</MONEY> and <MONEY>$8.22</MONEY> a barrel
respectively.
   Prices for European buyers during the first half of the month
averaged <MONEY>$14.39</MONEY> for Isthmus and <MONEY>$11.09</MONEY> for <ORGANIZATION>Maya</ORGANIZATION>, up from <MONEY>$12.79</MONEY> and
<MONEY>$9.71</MONEY>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Pemex</ORGANIZATION> said the increases were the result of ``the significant
recovery in prices of the principal crudes sold on the international
petroleum market'' following the agreement <DATE>Nov. 28</DATE> by the
<ORGANIZATION>Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries</ORGANIZATION>.
   <ORGANIZATION>OPEC</ORGANIZATION>'s 13 members agreed to lower their output by nearly 4
million barrels a day, to <MONEY>18.5 million barrels</MONEY> in an effort to stem
the flow of excess oil and reverse the decline of world oil prices.
<LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> is not a member of <ORGANIZATION>OPEC</ORGANIZATION>.
   Since the accord, prices for <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> crude, as well as <LOCATION>Middle East</LOCATION>
and other crudes, have risen more than <MONEY>$3</MONEY> a barrel.
   <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>'s crude oil exports for <DATE>1988</DATE> averaged 1.3 million barrels
a day and petrochemicals, 40,000 barrels a day, <ORGANIZATION>Pemex</ORGANIZATION> said.
   In <DATE>December</DATE>, <PERCENT>51.6 percent</PERCENT> of crude oil exports went to the <LOCATION>United
States</LOCATION>. <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> was the second largest buyer with <PERCENT>16 percent</PERCENT> and <PERCENT>13
percent</PERCENT> was sold to the <LOCATION>Far East</LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Mexico To Reduce Crude Exports 5 Percent On April 1</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY ISAAC A. LEVI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> announced <DATE>Friday</DATE> it is reducing crude
oil exports by <PERCENT>5 percent</PERCENT> beginning <DATE>April 1</DATE> in a coordinated move
with other producers in an effort to buttress prices on the world
market.
   Crude exports will be cut by an average of 68,600 barrels a day
from the current average of 1.37 million, the <ORGANIZATION>Department of Energy
and Mines</ORGANIZATION> said in a statement.
   ``With this, <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> fully acknowledges that strengthening the oil
market is a joint responsibility by producers and consumers, since
everyone benefits from a stable market and (fair) prices,'' it said.
   The statement did not give a time frame for the reduction but a
source at <ORGANIZATION>Pemex</ORGANIZATION>, the state petroleum monopoly, said the cut will
probably be maintained at least until the end of the year, depending
on world market conditions.
   The cut was tentatively agreed upon <DATE>Feb. 21</DATE> at a conference by
<LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> _ the world's fourth biggest producer and sixth largest
exporter _ and the five other non-OPEC producers in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>. Two
weeks of consultations and negotiations followed on the details.
   At the <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> conference, <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> proposed to cut exports by <PERCENT>5
percent</PERCENT> provided the other non-OPEC nations did the same. The
agreement came after the 13 members of the <ORGANIZATION>Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries</ORGANIZATION> agreed to cut exports during a meeting in
<LOCATION>Vienna</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Austria</LOCATION>.
   Participating in the talks at the <ORGANIZATION>Mexican Embassy</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> were
<LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Oman</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Angola</LOCATION>. The <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Colombia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>North Yemen</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Norway</LOCATION> and the state of <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION> and the
Canadian province of <LOCATION>Alberta</LOCATION> sent observers.
   Although <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> refuses to join <ORGANIZATION>OPEC</ORGANIZATION>, it has often used the
international cartel's guidelines to set prices and export limits.
   <ORGANIZATION>OPEC</ORGANIZATION> members <LOCATION>Alberia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ecuador</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Gabon</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Indonesia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Kuwait</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Libya</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Nigeria</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Qatar</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Saudi Arabia</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>United Arab
Emirates</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION> together were estimated to be producing in
<DATE>February</DATE> about 19.5 million barrels a day.
   This was 1 million above their agreed production limit but well
below their <DATE>fourth-quarter</DATE> production last year. <ORGANIZATION>OPEC</ORGANIZATION> has set a
target price of <MONEY>$18</MONEY> a barrel for the <DATE>second quarter of this year</DATE>.
   <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>'s production averages 2.5 million barrels a day, and about
half of it is exported to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>. <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, its principal
customer in the <LOCATION>Far East</LOCATION>, buys about 180,000 barrels daily. Mexico
also imports 56,000 barrels a day from the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> for its
northern border region to save transportation costs.
   On <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> reduced prices of its light Isthmus to
<LOCATION>Western Europe</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, and its extra-light Olmec to
the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> by <MONEY>10 cents</MONEY> a barrel, but kept the price of its
heavy Maya crude unchanged.
   Olmec, which <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> began producing in mid-1988, is sold only to
the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Pemex</ORGANIZATION> establishes its prices by region, using a formula based on
average prices on so-called world ``spot'' markets, where oil is
auctioned to the highest bidder. But it sells only to fast customers
under contract of one year or more.
   Thus, the price of <ORGANIZATION>Maya</ORGANIZATION> to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> averaged <MONEY>$12.38</MONEY> a barrels
during the first half of <DATE>January</DATE>, while Isthmus averaged <MONEY>$15.86</MONEY> and
Olmec <MONEY>$16.80</MONEY>. In <LOCATION>Western Europe</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Maya</ORGANIZATION> averaged <MONEY>$11.52</MONEY> and Isthmus
<MONEY>$15.71</MONEY> a barrel and in the <LOCATION>Far East Maya</LOCATION> averaged <MONEY>$12.20</MONEY> and Isthmus
<MONEY>$14.85</MONEY>, according to <ORGANIZATION>Pemex</ORGANIZATION> figures.

<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   <PERSON>Jeronimo Maya</PERSON> can't accept all the offers
he receives to play his guitar in flamenco concerts because there
are times when he has to stay home to do his homework.
   At 10, the guitar prodigy is already a veteran of three years of
flamenco shows, and his audiences have included <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>'s King <PERSON>Juan
Carlos</PERSON> and Queen <LOCATION>Sofia</LOCATION>. Last <DATE>August</DATE> he was invited to <PERSON>Jordan</PERSON> by
<PERSON>King Hussein</PERSON> and <PERSON>Queen Noor</PERSON> to play at a royal wedding in <LOCATION>Aqaba</LOCATION>.
   ``It's always nice to play for kings and queens,'' the youngster
said during in a recent interview. ``They're nice people to meet.''
   Following a recent sold-out performance in <LOCATION>Madrid</LOCATION>, a music
critic for <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>'s leading daily, <LOCATION>El Pais</LOCATION>, called <PERSON>Jeronimo</PERSON>
exceptionally talented.
   Jeronimo began playing professionally three years ago when his
guitar was nearly as big as he was. He has been studying since he
was 5 with his father, the noted flamenco guitarist <ORGANIZATION>Felipe Maya</ORGANIZATION>. He
also studies classical guitar at a <LOCATION>Madrid</LOCATION> conservatory.
   Maya says his son's talent and success are rooted in hard work,
not in any type of gift from God.
   Flamenco, which encompasses singing, guitar-playing, dancing and
hand-clapping, traces its roots to 16th century southern <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>
where it emerged as the artistic response of Gypsies to widespread

``juerga'' _ a sort of flamenco jam session _ at <ORGANIZATION>Candela</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Madrid</LOCATION>'s
hangout for flamenco artists and aficionados where he wows the
late-night crowd with the depth and sensitivity of his playing.
   Professional flamenco guitarists call him a young maestro who
plays at a level far advanced for his age.
   World-famous guitarist <PERSON>Sabicas</PERSON> says he has never heard a
youngster play so well.
   Jeronimo has already appeared twice in the annual ``Flamenco
Summit'' in <LOCATION>Madrid</LOCATION>, on a youth program in <DATE>1985</DATE> and as a featured
soloist last year, a spot usually reserved for such talents as <ORGANIZATION>Paco
de Lucia</ORGANIZATION>.
   Felipe <PERSON>Maya</PERSON> says <PERSON>Jeronimo</PERSON>, his other son and two daughters often
get together with him at home and hold their own ``juergas.''
   ``As Gypsies, we externalize our feelings and emotions,'' the
father said. ``We could be sitting around, and then we start
singing and dancing just because we feel like it.''
   Maya says his son has been fortunate not to encounter the
discrimination many Gypsy children suffer in Spanish schools.
   ``He's very down to earth, and in the school, people look up to
him,'' he said.
   <PERSON>Jeronimo</PERSON>, who wants to travel to <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> _
``to see the big <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> skyscrapers'' _ also likes Brazilian and
jazz guitar and says his favorite classical composers include
<PERSON>Mozart</PERSON>, <PERSON>Beethoven</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Debussy</ORGANIZATION>, the latter particularly because many
of his compositions were based on flamenco patterns.

FT  19 SEP 92 / Arts: Cultures before Columbus - An ancient art with a
modern feel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIMOTHY POTTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE quincentenary of <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>'s landfall in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> has been the source of
considerable soul searching in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>. While mainstream Mr and <LOCATION>Ms America</LOCATION>
may be happy to celebrate <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>'s Transatlantic leap, the original new
worlders (not to mention the watchdogs of political correctness) are
demanding apologies and penance for the devastation which the 'white gods'
from the east wrought on the indigeous peoples they encountered.
There is then a timeliness in The Art of <LOCATION>Ancient Mexico</LOCATION>, a fascinating and
worthy celebration of the arts of the Olmecs, <LOCATION>Mayas</LOCATION>, Aztecs and other
cultures which dominated <LOCATION>Mesoamerica</LOCATION> for some 3,000 years before the arrival
of the Spanish. The works have been assembled from the major public
collections of <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>, judiciously supplemented by the British Museum
(Museum of <LOCATION>Mankind</LOCATION>).
It has been over 20 years since the last major exhibition of ancient Mexican
art in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, and an innocent eye is in this case not a bad way to confront
cultures at once so alien and yet visually accessible. By eliciting
reactions we normally expect only from modern western art, Precolumbian art
stoutly refuses to be approached in a narrowly archaeological or even
historical mindset.
A palma of Brancusi-like simplicity and elegance demands to be admired as
pure form, despite its presumed religious or practical function. A Totonac
sculptor carves a head in which only one half of the face is shown, the
other half left undefined and emerging from its stone casing. It is all one
can do to resist images of <ORGANIZATION>Michelangelo</ORGANIZATION>'s bound figures in the <LOCATION>Louvre</LOCATION>. The
<PERSON>Chac Mool</PERSON> reclining on his elbows, was so thoroughly imbibed by <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> that
it seems here strangely familiar and modern. So too the Huastec sculptures
and a <LOCATION>Veracruz</LOCATION> jaguar mask which have a futuristic primitivism that is pure
Star Wars. <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> can surely boast some of the most alien of all human art
and it is no accident that <PERSON>Eric von Daniken</PERSON> found here so much fodder for
his extra terrestrial dreamings.
Mayan art, widely regarded as the high-point of the Precolumbian
achievement, took the decorative and iconographic principles established by
the Olmecs in the centuries before <LOCATION>Christ</LOCATION> to a new level of delicacy and
refinement. Jaina ceramic figurines of a women, priests and warriors are
exquisite genre studies whose faces are to be seen all over the Yucatan to
this day. Jade was exploited to lavish effect in relief carvings and, most
spectacularly, in human masks. The so-called 'eccentric flints', fashioned
by knapping the brittle stone with extraordinary skill into bizarre forms,
remain something of an enigma. Disappointingly, there is not a single piece
of 'narrative style' Mayan pottery, in which the native American's show a
remarkable facility for two-dimensional naturalism - an unexpected foil to
the mainstream spirit of strict iconographical formalism.
One surprise is the virtual silence in which the exhibition passes over the
revolution currently taking place in Mayan studies from the decipherment of
the Mayan hieroglyphic script. Since the script is itself a pictorial code
whose understanding is intimately linked to the symbolism of Mayan art, this
new insight lifts a veil from Mayan iconography too. As in <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>, much
ancient Mexican art needs to be deciphered in as precise and literal a way
as writing. The more official and ceremonial pieces are interspersed with
pottery and other items of everyday use, including rare wood-carvings. These
are much more spontaneous and imaginative, showing the exuberance of the
household or village craft tradition. In the human- and animal-shaped
vessels of the <LOCATION>Colima</LOCATION> potters lies a virtual menagerie of local wildlife and
domestic scenes - a baby, an emaciated hunchback, an acrobat - keenly
observed with real sympathy and inventively adapted to shapes that can also
function as vessels.
The show has been laid out with a keen eye for design and lighting, with
adequate wall tests including evocative quotations from ancient Mexican
texts. The designers have made the most of an awkward ramp at the entrance
by arranging a series of intimidating Huastec statues in sentry-like rows.
The layout of material is by regions, which only partly correspond to the
major cultural entities (<ORGANIZATION>Olmec</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Maya</ORGANIZATION>, Aztec etc.) and cuts across both media
and periods. No system is perfect but this is a half-way measure which fully
serves neither an archaeological nor an artistic end.
The handsome catalogue is itself no small design achievement whose superb
illustrations provide much food for further thought and admiration. Alas the
text - a direct translation of the Spanish version - is rather idiosyncratic
in its selection of themes and suffers from the user-unfriendly focus of
academics. The short bibliography ignores most of the major English-language
studies.
The gold which fuelled the Conquistadores ravages is conspicuoulsy absent
from The Art of <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>. This is only partly the result of the mindless orgy
in which the finest handiwork of the American goldsmiths was consigned
wholesale to the melting pot by the Spanish invaders. Unlike their South
American contemporaries, the Classic and earlier cultures of <LOCATION>Mesoamerica</LOCATION> did
not much value the yellow metal, importing it from the south only sparingly.
The Hayward show rightly avoids any hint of gold lust, focusing instead on
the myriad other artictic achievements of these most ill-fated of peoples.

<HEAD>Mexico Begins Marketing New Light Crude</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>'s state oil monopoly <ORGANIZATION>Pemex</ORGANIZATION> has begun
marketing a new high-grade crude in the international petroleum
market, the government newspaper <ORGANIZATION>El Nacional</ORGANIZATION> reported.
   Abundio <PERSON>Juarez Mendez</PERSON>, deputy director of primary production for
<ORGANIZATION>Pemex</ORGANIZATION>, said the company last month exported 250,000 42-gallon
barrels of the new crude, called Olmeca. He did not identify the
purchaser.
   He said the new crude can be priced a dollar more a barrel than
the Isthmus brand, which previously was the nation's superior oil.
Mexico also exports a heavy crude, called Maya.
   ``(<LOCATION>Olmeca</LOCATION>) is much finer than Isthmus (and) it is superior to
Arab light,'' <PERSON>Juarez Mendez</PERSON> told local reporters at an oil
conference on Latin American drilling, according to the article,
which was published <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>, he said, has the capacity to eventually export 125,000
barrels to 150,000 barrels a day of the new crude, which is being
extracted from fields in the southeastern state of Tabasco along
the coast of the <LOCATION>Gulf of Mexico</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Juarez Mendez</PERSON> said the new oil has a density of between 38 and
40 on the <ORGANIZATION>American Petroleum Institute</ORGANIZATION> scale, compared to a density
of 32 to 34 for Isthmus.
   The English-language daily <ORGANIZATION>Mexico City News</ORGANIZATION> quoted an
unidentified <ORGANIZATION>Pemex</ORGANIZATION> official as saying the government ``is not yet
sure how much light oil it has. Pemex is still exploring.''
   ``There is probably not much Olmeca in <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>,'' he was quoted
as saying.
   <ORGANIZATION>Pemex</ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, reported that prices to Japanese clients for
Isthmus and Maya crudes were held steady in <DATE>May</DATE>
   The price for Isthmus was <MONEY>$15.30</MONEY> a barrel in <DATE>May</DATE> to <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, the
same as in <DATE>April</DATE>, and for <ORGANIZATION>Maya</ORGANIZATION>, <MONEY>$12.60</MONEY> a barrel.
   ``This reflects the stability that prevails in the general level
of prices in the international oil market,'' <ORGANIZATION>Pemex</ORGANIZATION> said in a
statement.
   <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> has a contract with Japanese customers to supply 180,000
barrels of oil a day, the statement said.
   <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>'s prices vary according to geographical area. The oil
company did not give the <DATE>May</DATE> prices for <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and European customers.
   In <DATE>April</DATE>, the price of the Isthmus brand to <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> customers was
<MONEY>$16</MONEY> a barrel and <MONEY>$12.77</MONEY> for the heavy type.
   Mexico maintains an export platform of <MONEY>1.36 million barrels</MONEY> a
day.

In a letter to the <LOCATION>San Diego Zoo</LOCATION>, investigators at the <ORGANIZATION>Humane Society</ORGANIZATION> of the 
<LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> contended <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> that the zoo's elephant exhibit is inadequate 
and "extremely dangerous" for both the huge mammals and their keepers. 
</P>
<P>
The open letter to <PERSON>Doug Meyers</PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION>San Diego Zoological Society</ORGANIZATION>, 
was prompted by the death <DATE>Sunday</DATE> of <ORGANIZATION>Maya</ORGANIZATION>, a 51-year-old Asian elephant. Zoo 
officials ordered that Maya be killed after being crippled by a fall into an 
elephant yard moat. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not question the care Maya received after her tragic fall, nor the fact 
that euthanasia was the humane decision to make on her behalf," wrote <PERSON>David K. 
Wills</PERSON>, a vice president in the <ORGANIZATION>Humane Society's Department of Investigations</ORGANIZATION>. 
"However, we are concerned as to what steps zoo officials are going to take to 
improve conditions for the surviving elephants." 
</P>
<P>
Wills contended that there are uninsulated floors and insufficient heat inside 
the barn-like structure and that the exhibit provides limited outdoor shelter. 
He also questioned the daily reliance on chains to restrain the elephants and 
called for widening of the catwalk connecting two parts of the elephant yard. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Jeff Jouett</PERSON>, a spokesman for the zoo, acknowledged that the nearly 30-year-old 
elephant yard is "not perfect," but he said the zoo is improving it. Shade 
trees have been planted and decaying floorboards replaced, he said. The zoo 
also plans to widen the catwalk. 
</P>
<P>
Jouett rejected Wills' charge that Maya might be alive if the catwalk were 
wider, saying no one witnessed her fall or her position on the walkway. He also 
denied that the exhibit, which houses one African and three Asian elephants, is 
"grossly inadequate." 
</P>
<P>
"It has passed <ORGANIZATION>USDA</ORGANIZATION> inspections and we'll welcome the <ORGANIZATION>USDA</ORGANIZATION> to come look at it 
again," <PERSON>Jouett</PERSON> said, noting that <ORGANIZATION>Wills</ORGANIZATION> has asked the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Department of 
Agriculture</ORGANIZATION> to investigate the exhibit. He called most of Wills' allegations 
"exaggerations to catch the public's attention. It makes nice quotes but it's 
just not true." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Dr. Homer Malaby</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>USDA</ORGANIZATION> animal-care specialist in <LOCATION>Sacramento</LOCATION>, said he will 
visit the zoo next week to investigate the <ORGANIZATION>Humane Society</ORGANIZATION>'s allegations.

<LEADPARA>  'SEA, sun, sand and sex" vs. ecotourism: When surveyed, 77 percent of a group
from Liverpool, England, vacationing in Cancun, Mexico, didn't know what
country they were in, said Bill Garrett, former editor of National Geographic,
speaking at the World Congress on Adventure Travel and Eco-tourism recently in
Colorado Springs.;   What most of the 1.5 million annual visitors to Cancun
also don't know, Garrett said, is that just a few miles away are more ancient
ruins than can be found in Egypt -- built by a culture that lasted six times
longer than the Roman Empire and was in full flower when Europe was in the

Foundation</ORGANIZATION>, aimed at fostering "rational and sustainable" tourism development
in the ecologically and archaeologically rich areas of <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> and Central
America.;   The economic, population and political pressures there are
destroying the culture and natural resources. Just to survive, the people must
cut down the forests, <PERSON>Garrett</PERSON> says. In <LOCATION>Guatemala</LOCATION>, for instance, the average
agricultural worker earns <MONEY>$2</MONEY> a day, while a gallon of milk costs <MONEY>$1.60</MONEY> and a
gallon of gas costs <MONEY>$2</MONEY>. "One of the hottest-selling items in that area is the
chain saw. The main industries are killing animals to sell their pelts,
growing crops of marijuana, logging and illegal pet trade in jungle birds and
animals.;   "We have to make the environmental and cultural aspects too
valuable to be destroyed -- too valuable to the local people for them to
destroy them." Ecotourists, he says, have been found to spend twice as much
money as the "sea, sun, sand and sex" crowd -- "and may even have twice as
much fun." La <ORGANIZATION>Ruta Maya</ORGANIZATION> tries to help villages set up their own tourism
businesses -- to act as guides or make reproductions. Another idea is having
"adventure" travelers stay with Maya families. The foundation is also helping

<TEXT>
   Midnight street theater, Cuban jazz,
flamenco dance, roving street clowns and mimes: It's all part of the
<ORGANIZATION>International Cervantes Festival</ORGANIZATION>, a two-week celebration staged each
fall in this charming colonial city.
   The 16th annual edition of <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>'s cultural event features about
150 dance, theater and music repertory groups from 57 countries and
<LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>.
   It also draws countless ``unofficial'' folk bands, clowns and
mimes to the twisting cobblestoned streets and hidden alleys of
<LOCATION>Guanajuato</LOCATION>, a 16th century silver mining town about 225 miles
northwest of <LOCATION>Mexico City</LOCATION>.
   ``The festival is an expression of friendship between peoples,''
says <PERSON>Lourdes Gomez</PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION>Cervantino</ORGANIZATION>, as the event
is known in Spanish. ``People forget about their troubles, and
culture overcomes crisis.''
   Each year, thousands of visitors from <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> and abroad enjoy
near-continuous performances staged in streets, theaters, parks and
open-air stages throughout the city.
   The sounds of Andean flute music give way to brass, reggae and
rock 'n' roll. Strollers always seem to be gathered on some street
or plaza enjoying an impromptu mime act or a play sandwiched between
the festival's headline events.
   Among them was the stirring performance last week by <PERSON>Mario Maya</PERSON>'s
flamenco dance company, the <ORGANIZATION>Andalusian Gypsy Theater</ORGANIZATION>. The sharp,
clipped vibrations of the troupe's exaggerated handclapping and
foot-stepping were felt throughout the four-tiered Juarez Theater.
   The choreographer, born into a Gypsy family that lived in a cave
in <LOCATION>Granada</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>, says he began experimenting with forms of
flamenco dance theater in the <DATE>1960s</DATE> as a way to fight the
marginalization of Gypsy culture under the Franco regime.
   ``For me, it was a necessity. Flamenco was a way of expression,
of spreading the culture through theater,'' <PERSON>Maya</PERSON> says, describing
his efforts as the ``folklorization'' of flamenco.
   The troupe's sharp dance score, complemented by an encore of
individual performances, elicited bravos and a standing ovation in
the theater.
   The smell of roasted corn husks filled the air as <PERSON>Jose Maria
Vitier</PERSON>'s nine-piece jazz band from <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION> torched the open-air stage
at <LOCATION>Guanajuato</LOCATION>'s downtown granary, the site of bloody fighting during
<LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>'s fight for independence from <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>.
   With <PERSON>Vitier</PERSON> hammering on a Steinway and electric pianos, and
<PERSON>Lazaro Gonzalez</PERSON> on violin, the ensemble sped through 12 numbers that
included a percussion-driven rendition of <PERSON>Keith Jarrett</PERSON>'s ``My
Song.''
   Those who weren't at the granary were on the street in front of
the Juarez Theater, surrounding Indian saxophonist <PERSON>Kandri Gopalnath</PERSON>
as he knelt on a 7-foot square Persian rug and wailed on the
instrument.
   Fusing the Western sax with <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> musical strands, <PERSON>Gopalnath</PERSON>'s
free-form instrumental at times differed little from the sounds of
sitar and provoked wondrous stares from some in the crowd, and
evident delight among others.
   <LOCATION>Guatemala</LOCATION>'s Fine Arts <ORGANIZATION>Marimba</ORGANIZATION> ensemble offered a melodious
sampling of ancient Meso-American songs inside the colonial <ORGANIZATION>Temple</ORGANIZATION>
of <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> church. The group displayed the remarkable flexibility
of the marimba in wrapping up its performance with mambo, merengue
and even polka numbers.
   With <LOCATION>Guanajuato</LOCATION>'s streets under cover of darkness, a woman in
peasant dress emerged from an alleyway into the central Plaza Jardin
pounding on a drum and heralding the beginning of a phantom-like
spectacle by <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>'s Tascabile de <LOCATION>Bergamo</LOCATION> theater troupe.
   The silent drama, ``Albatross,'' was performed by four actors on
stilts, draped in white and scarlet and carrying torches. Its story
of lovers who are threatened by the seductress albatross coursed
through <LOCATION>Guanajuato</LOCATION>'s narrow streets at <TIME>midnight</TIME> as the crowd of
spectators eagerly followed.
   The play reached its dramatic conclusion in the Plaza Jardin when
other ``evil'' albatrosses appeared screaming on rooftops above,
their white robes in stark contrast against the <TIME>night</TIME> sky.
   These were but a sampling of the <ORGANIZATION>Cervantes Festival</ORGANIZATION>'s offerings
to a delighted public. The Jamaican reggae band <LOCATION>Chalice</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s
eclectic Bow Gamelan Ensemble, the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Vilnius Opera
Ballet Theater</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Anna Sokolow</PERSON>'s dance company and <PERSON>Igor</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>Cowboy Jazz
Band</ORGANIZATION> from the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> also staged appearances.
   The <ORGANIZATION>University of Guanajuato</ORGANIZATION>, a prominent fine arts institution,
supplied numerous student theater and musical performances
throughout the festival. But they and dozens of repertory groups
from <LOCATION>Latin America</LOCATION> and the world will be back next year.
   ``We're already working on it,'' says <PERSON>Gomez</PERSON>.

  [Text] The recently dedicated <PERSON>Maya Aqueduct</PERSON> will benefit 
more than 14,000 people, representing more than half the 
population of <ORGANIZATION>Maisi Muncipality</ORGANIZATION>, the easternmost point in <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION> 
and the main coffee producer in the country. Further details on 
this by reporter <PERSON>Leonel Perez Moya</PERSON>: 
  [Begin Perez recording] Using its own resources, at a cost 
of 
690,000 pesos, the revamped plant operates by gravity and 
replaces the old, inefficient installation that has been 
corroded by inclement weather. The approximate five km of 
conduits and pipes of various diameters, leading to the main 
duct, replaces the pumping system, with an annual savings of 590 
megawatts of electricity. 
  This inexpensive technology provides for a continuous supply 
of potable water to residents of <ORGANIZATION>Punta de Maisi</ORGANIZATION> on the 
easternmost point of the nation; to <LOCATION>La Maquina</LOCATION>, the center of 
<ORGANIZATION>Maisi Municipality</ORGANIZATION>; and to eight other populated settlements. 
Water is also carried to the largest coffee plant in the zone 
and to the family doctors' offices, to schools, minifarms, 
agricultural areas, and other socioeconomic institutions. [end

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Guatemalan guerrilla activities monitored through 1 
<DATE>June</DATE>. 
  A bomb exploded yesterday at 1800 near Channel 7's 
installations, hurling pamphlets of the <ORGANIZATION>Rebel Armed Forces</ORGANIZATION> with 
slogans against the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> and calling for the creation of the 
<ORGANIZATION>Truth Commission</ORGANIZATION>, an issue that is yet to be discussed at the 
negotiations table. The explosion caused no property damage but 
frightened people who were nearby. (<LOCATION>Guatemala City SIGLO 
VEINTIUNO</LOCATION> in Spanish 28 <DATE>May 94</DATE> p 12) 
  <ORGANIZATION>National Police</ORGANIZATION> agents captured two guerrilla suspects; one 
near <LOCATION>Maya</LOCATION> neighborhood in Zone 18 and the other near the Guarda 
market in Zone 11. In the first case, the <ORGANIZATION>National Police</ORGANIZATION>'s 
Public Relations office noted, the suspect was captured when 
several policemen were attacked by three individuals riding a 
blue <ORGANIZATION>Mitsubishi</ORGANIZATION> vehicle near the bus station in <LOCATION>Maya</LOCATION> 
neighborhood. The second suspect attracted the attention of the 
police because of his suspicious attitude. He was carrying a 
briefcase that contained three grenades. (<LOCATION>Guatemala City

<HEAD>Mexico Raises Some Light Crude Oil Prices By 10 Cents</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ISAAC A. LEVI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mexico plans to cut oil exports about <PERCENT>5
percent</PERCENT> and raise some crude prices by <MONEY>10 cents</MONEY> a barrel starting
<DATE>March 1</DATE> in an effort to help strengthen world oil prices, government
sources said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
   The disclosures followed <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>'s meeting in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> of non-OPEC
producing countries, including <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>, who have pledged to support
<ORGANIZATION>OPEC</ORGANIZATION>'s effort to reduce production and raise prices.
   A source at the state oil monopoly, <ORGANIZATION>Pemex</ORGANIZATION>, who insisted on
anonymity, said the government would announce the cuts within the
next few days.
   <PERSON>Emilio Matar</PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION>Pemex</ORGANIZATION>, confirmed that the new
prices would take effect <DATE>March 1</DATE>.
   The increases would be for the posted price of Mexican light
Isthmus sold to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Western Europe</LOCATION> and extra-light
Olmec sold to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>.
   Energy and <ORGANIZATION>Mines</ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON>Fernando Hiriart</PERSON> told reporters on
<DATE>Monday</DATE> that <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> was willing to reduce its exports by 5 to <PERCENT>6
percent</PERCENT> for the rest of this year, provided other oil exporting
countries reduce their sales.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Pemex</ORGANIZATION> source said that if other countries honor the <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>
agreement <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> would reduce its average daily exports by as much
as 65,000 barrels a day. The amount would probably vary from month
to month, but could average about <PERCENT>5 percent</PERCENT> lower than <DATE>January</DATE>
exports, the source said.
   The source did not say which countries' exports would be targeted
for cutbacks.
   Details of the <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> agreement have not been released. A
statement issued after <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>'s meeting said that some countries
would reduce exports while others would freeze sales temporarily and
that details were forthcoming.
   Production by <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>, the world's sixth largest crude oil
producer, averages 2.5 million barrels a day. In <DATE>January</DATE>, it
exported a total of 1.3 million barrels a day _ approximately half
to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>. <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, its principal customer in the <LOCATION>Far East</LOCATION>,
buys an average of 180,000 barrels daily.
   Mexico also imports 58,000 barrels daily from the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>
for some of its northern border region to save transportation costs.
   Last <DATE>November</DATE>, the 13-member <ORGANIZATION>Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries</ORGANIZATION> agreed to lower its exports to <MONEY>18.5 million barrels</MONEY> a day
in the <DATE>first half of 1989</DATE> to buoy world market prices and called on
independent producers to make similar cuts. <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> is not a member
of <ORGANIZATION>OPEC</ORGANIZATION>, but often uses that international cartel's pricing
guidelines.
   <ORGANIZATION>OPEC</ORGANIZATION>, whose production late last year was estimated at <MONEY>22.5
million barrels</MONEY> a day, agreed to the new quota after oil prices
sagged to about <MONEY>$10</MONEY> a barrel, well below the cartel's benchmark of
<MONEY>$18</MONEY>.
   Mexico sets different prices for its crude for the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Far East</LOCATION>, under long-term contracts with individual
customers.
   The price of heavy Maya to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> averaged <MONEY>$12.38</MONEY> a
barrel during the first half of <DATE>January</DATE>, while Isthmus averaged
<MONEY>$15.86</MONEY> and Olmec <MONEY>$16.80</MONEY> barrel. In <LOCATION>Western Europe</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Maya</ORGANIZATION> averaged
<MONEY>$11.52</MONEY> and Isthmus <MONEY>$15.71</MONEY> a barrel. In the <LOCATION>Far East</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Maya</ORGANIZATION> averaged
<MONEY>$12.20</MONEY> and Isthmus <MONEY>$14.85</MONEY> a barrel, according to the latest <ORGANIZATION>Pemex</ORGANIZATION>
figures.
   <ORGANIZATION>Pemex</ORGANIZATION> sells Olmec, which it started producing in mid-1988 in
small quantities, only to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>.

<HEADLINE>  THE RITE STUFF
OPERA SAN JOSE WORKS TO TURN SACRED TEXTS, MODERN
MUSIC INTO AN OPERA OF THE CONTINENT BEFORE
COLUMBUS  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Opera  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     The scene is from a workshop presentation of an excerpt from "<PERSON>Popol Vuh</PERSON>," a
commissioned opera-in-progress, which could become the most ambitious project
attempted by <ORGANIZATION>Opera San Jose.</ORGANIZATION>;   With a score by prize-winning electronic
composer <ORGANIZATION>Allen Strange</ORGANIZATION>, a libretto by <PERSON>Robert Jenkins</PERSON> and choreography by <PERSON>David
A. Vargas</PERSON>, the 16-minute excerpt staged recently at <LOCATION>San Jose State</LOCATION> was as
visually stunning and exotic as anything in "Aida" or "L'Africaine.";   This
operatic pie-slice is decidedly unorthodox, using computer-generated music
throughout and no acoustic instruments.;   <ORGANIZATION>Composer Strange</ORGANIZATION>, a nationally
recognized <ORGANIZATION>San Jose State</ORGANIZATION> faculty member, had never written an opera before.
He ran across a translation of "Popol Vuh" in a bookstore -- misplaced in the
cooking section. He and librettist <PERSON>Jenkins</PERSON> approached Opera <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION> about
writing an opera based on the work.;   "I always thought of opera as
19th-century TV," he commented after accepting a commission to start on the
project.;   A number of listeners at the <DATE>Aug. 22</DATE> presentation were so
impressed that they stayed to see a second run-through later the same evening
-- this, despite the use of the Central American texts, three languages, the
electronic score and some moments that seemed more like anthropology than
opera.;   Indeed, some accurately inflected Quiche-Mayan spoken texts had been
provided on audio tape by <ORGANIZATION>Stanford</ORGANIZATION> anthropology professor <PERSON>James Fox</PERSON>. They were
sprinkled in with the singing in English and Spanish.;   <LOCATION>Opera San Jose</LOCATION> has
taken a cautious approach to the project in this recession year. The company
gave the green light for the 16-minute workshop scene with makeup and
costumes. A grant of over <MONEY>$9,000</MONEY> from the <ORGANIZATION>San Jose Fine Arts Commission</ORGANIZATION> was
seed money for the mini-production, whose costs were estimated at <MONEY>$14,000</MONEY> in
cash and <MONEY>$30,000</MONEY> in in-kind services.;   <LOCATION>Opera San Jose</LOCATION> videotaped the
workshop in order to interest potential contributors. The company has set an
<DATE>August 1992</DATE> deadline for raising the "<MONEY>$80,000</MONEY> to <MONEY>$100,000</MONEY>" needed for
completion of the libretto and score, according to executive director <PERSON>Craig
Palmer</PERSON>. Says <PERSON>Palmer</PERSON>, "This piece is at least three to four years away" from
the main stage.;   The basis of the libretto is the opening portion of "<PERSON>Popol
Vuh</PERSON>," the sacred book of the ancient Quiche Mayas, whose descendants still
survive in the highlands of Guatemala.;   The earliest written versions of
"Popol Vuh" were set down on scrolls in the mid-16th century by native priests
who feared that otherwise their indigenous tradition would be wiped out by the
Spanish conquistadors.;   The opera adaptation of "Popol Vuh" represents an
unusual attempt at an honest and historically informed portrayal of a tale
drawn from an indigenous American culture.;   Older operas were not nearly as
true to their historic sources. The two "Montezuma" operas by <PERSON>Karl Heinrich
Graun</PERSON> (1755) and <PERSON>Roger Sessions</PERSON> (<DATE>1962</DATE>) are rooted firmly in the European
operatic tradition. And two better-known works -- <PERSON>Purcell</PERSON>'s "The Indian Queen"
(1694) and <PERSON>Offenbach</PERSON>'s "La Perichole" (1868) -- are merely excuses for
European singers with thoroughly European scores to don exotic finery and play
out painfully implausible tales. Unlike "<PERSON>Popol Vuh</PERSON>," none of these is written
from the perspective of New World peoples.;   But despite the admirable
intentions, producer <PERSON>Daniel Helfgot</PERSON> had to overcome resistance when he sought
out dancers who could perform in the Aztec and Mayan traditions from the local
group Tezkatlipoka. "The dancers were suspicious," said <PERSON>Helfgot</PERSON>, an urbane
emigre from <PERSON>Buenos Aires</PERSON> and the only Latin American involved on the creative
team. "They wondered, 'What do these Caucasians want to do?' Now they have
joined us. But we are sensitive to them.";   Asked about the possibility of
offending the surviving descendants of the Quiche Mayas, librettist <PERSON>Jenkins</PERSON>
said, "I've worried a lot over it. . . . (Therefore) we're staying as close as
possible to the sacred text.";   Apart from this problem, there's also a
question of how well the stories will translate to the operatic stage. To this
critic, the excerpt at <ORGANIZATION>San Jose State</ORGANIZATION> offered more color than drama. The
decision to stick closely to the Mayan codex appears to be pushing the work
toward ceremony and away from plot development and a strong set of central
characters. Most of the scene played like something akin to Pharaonic rites or
a religious service.;   Baroque composers faced a similar quandary in dealing
with sacred texts. The prolific opera composer <PERSON>Handel</PERSON> put his Biblical works
into oratorio (concert) form rather than opera. Bach created his Passions for
use in the church rather than on the stage; modern-day operatic stagings of
his great "St. <PERSON>Matthew</PERSON>'s Passion" have not met with favor, despite repeated
attempts.;   Still, it's clear that <LOCATION>Opera San Jose</LOCATION> has made great strides,
demonstrating its excellent production skills even in the bare-bones <ORGANIZATION>San Jose
State Studio Theater</ORGANIZATION>. The ensemble had done its homework, and the presentation
had integrity.;   As for theatricality, the overrunning of the Mayan religious
rites by the conquistadors in one portion provided a vivid if melodramatic
touch.;   While the fund-raising effort goes on, the <LOCATION>Opera San Jose</LOCATION> creative
team, from artistic director <PERSON>Irene Dalis</PERSON> to conductor <PERSON>Barbara Day Turner</PERSON> to
choreographer <PERSON>David A. Vargas</PERSON>, are hoping enough backers will be found to make
the opera happen.;   <ORGANIZATION>Composer Strange</ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, has musical sketches galore,
with five discs of computer-synthesized flute music alone.;   "With
computer-generated music, every minute (performed) takes about 18 hours of
work" by the composer, Strange says. "And that isn't much different than
traditional composing (for voice and orchestra).";   If this project catches
on, and the entire five-volume set of sacred writings of the Quiche Mayas were
to be turned into opera, Strange's score would make <PERSON>Richard Wagner</PERSON>'s epic
"Ring" cycle look like a minuet. If dramatized at the current rate, the entire
set would entail well in excess of 60 hours of music.;   Now that would be an
opera to remember. (box)  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Oil Spill Spreads To Major Port</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A huge oil slick caused by the collision of two
freighters has floated near the mouth of a leading northeastern
port, officials said <DATE>today</DATE>.
   The 40-square-mile slick is near the <LOCATION>Dalian</LOCATION> port and is
continuing to move east in the direction of <LOCATION>North Korea</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Zhu Li</PERSON> of
the <ORGANIZATION>Dalian Marine Safety Supervision Bureau</ORGANIZATION> said in a telephone
interview.
   The <ORGANIZATION>State Oceanography Bureau</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION> said it was <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>'s
largest oil spill ever from an ocean vessel, but it could not
assess the seriousness of the environmental damage.
   The spill has received little attention in the official media
and there has been no outcry over responsibility.
   The spill was caused by the <DATE>June 8</DATE> collision of two
Japanese-owned freighters in the <LOCATION>Bohai Gulf</LOCATION>, east of <LOCATION>Tianjin</LOCATION>. One
vessel, the Maya 8, sank and began leaking its fuel oil. It was not
carrying any cargo.
   The second ship, the <LOCATION>Spring Falcon</LOCATION>, loaded with magnesium ore,
rescued the Maya 8's crew and continued its journey to <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>.
   Both the <ORGANIZATION>Oceanography Bureau</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Marine Safety Supervision
Bureau</ORGANIZATION> said they did not know how much oil the Maya 8 was carrying.
The People's Daily, which reported the slick's spread to near
<LOCATION>Dalian</LOCATION>, said that as of <DATE>Thursday</DATE> oil continued to leak from the
vessel but the flow had slowed.
   The slick near <LOCATION>Dalian</LOCATION> appeared to be only one portion of the oil
leak. Initial reports after the collision said oil was covering
more than 480 square miles.
   <PERSON>Ms. Zhu</PERSON> said she did not know whether the spill would affect
shipping and fishing in the gulf.
   She said that by cutting off the oxygen supply to the water, the
oil spill had produced a red tide _ a proliferation of red
organisms that can harm fish and plant life.
   Efforts are being made to clean up the oil, she said, but she
could give no details. She did not know the cost of the cleanup.

<HEAD>Birds of Prey Research Leads To Forest Preservation Work</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL ERTELT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOISE, Idaho (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   From the Great Seal of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> to
the folklore of Native Americans, birds of prey have been powerful
symbols of freedom, dignity and strength.
   But eagles, hawks and other raptors also send another message.
Because of their position near the top of the food chain, they serve
as environmental monitors, warning of impending danger like canaries
in a coal mine.
   ``If we see things happening to these birds ... that signals us
that there are more severe problems lower down in the food chain,''
said <PERSON>Tom Cade</PERSON>, who founded the Peregrine Fund in <DATE>1970</DATE> while a
professor at <ORGANIZATION>Cornell University</ORGANIZATION>.
   Peregrine Fund researchers and volunteers, who helped bring the
species back from near extinction, now are applying what they
learned to the study and preservation of raptors _ predatory birds
distinguished by talons, hooked beaks and keen eyesight _ from the
jungles of <LOCATION>Guatemala</LOCATION> to the plains of <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>.
   At the <ORGANIZATION>World Center for Birds</ORGANIZATION> of Prey in the southwestern <LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION>
desert, researchers breed tropical raptors in captivity for release
in the wild. Others are in the field, collecting data on the birds
in their native habitat.
   Their work has led them into the battle to preserve tropical rain
forests that are home to half the world's plant and animal species
and are disappearing at the rate of 50 acres a minutes, said <PERSON>Bill
Burnham</PERSON>, the center's director.
   ``Many of the nations are beginning to see their environments as
their futures,'' <PERSON>Burnham</PERSON> said. ``If you eliminate your natural
resources, if you cut down all your forests, your children and your
grandchildren won't have much to look forward to.''
   The impact of the rain forests reaches far beyond the boundaries
of the nations they cover; many songbirds, waterfowl and raptors
considered indigenous to <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION> actually spend much of their
time in the tropics.
   ``Wildlife do not recognize political boundaries,'' <PERSON>Burnham</PERSON> said.
``You can't be provincial and manage a highly migratory species.''
   Little is known about many of the tropical raptors, and ``there
is no way to know how to preserve them if you know nothing about
them,'' he said.
   In its ``Maya Project'' in <LOCATION>Guatemala</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Belize</LOCATION>, the Peregrine
Fund is studying raptors in both pristine and altered forests to see
how the birds adapt to changes in their environment. It also is
trying to determine where the birds live in the forests and how much
territory they need to survive and breed _ information that later
can be used in establishing wildlife preserves.
   For example, the harpy eagle, thought to be the most powerful
eagle in the world, may require 5,000 acres or more for each pair,
<PERSON>Cade</PERSON> said.
   Studying the birds first required finding them in the dense,
mosquito-infested jungles. From perches atop trees and ancient Mayan
temples, researchers were able to observe some birds flying above
the forest canopy. Other species were lured with taped calls. The
team has detected 26 raptor species in the two Central American
nations.
   Working with peregrines not only gave the group a scientific
background that can be applied to other raptors, but it also helped
them develop skills needed to work with other people, <PERSON>Burnham</PERSON> said.
``Cooperation is the key word. We are not a confrontational
organization. We are a conservation organization that works together
with other groups.''
   Among those cooperating on the <ORGANIZATION>Maya Project</ORGANIZATION> are <LOCATION>Guatemala</LOCATION>'s
<ORGANIZATION>Institute of Anthropology</ORGANIZATION> and History and the <ORGANIZATION>Belize Department of
Agriculture</ORGANIZATION>.
   Though prospects of saving tropical raptors seem daunting, the
Peregrine Fund can take heart from past success when the odds were
against them.
   Because of the effects of the pesticide DDT, peregrine falcons,
once common in much of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, had been had reduced to 35
pairs by <DATE>1975</DATE>, and none remained east of the <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION>. Largely
through the efforts of the fund, there now are more than 600 falcons
in 25 states. The group's goal is to have the birds removed from the
endangered species list by the turn of the century.
   ``It's gone a long way further than I ever envisioned it back
when we started,'' <PERSON>Cade</PERSON> said.

THE TAX MAN APOLOGIZES; 
</P>
<P>
PUBLIC RETRACTION IS DUE THOSE WRONGLY NAMED AS DELINQUENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
<PERSON>Ray Fowler</PERSON> scanned his morning newspaper to see whether any of his friends or 
neighbors had made the list of <LOCATION>Los Angeles County</LOCATION> taxpayers who were late 
paying their property taxes. The last thing he expected to find was his own 
name. 
</P>
<P>
"It is just not a happy experience to go whipping down the delinquency column 
and find yourself listed there," he said -- especially since he had paid his 
taxes. He said the list, prepared by the county tax collector, left his friends 
and neighbors with the erroneous impression that "<PERSON>Ray Fowler</PERSON> is a deadbeat" and 
brought him "strange looks" at his bank. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like having a pie thrown in your face," said <PERSON>Lillian Romero-Gomez</PERSON>, who 
was shocked to find her name on the list, even after she had sent copies of her 
paid tax bill to the tax collector's office. 
</P>
<P>
They and a few other taxpayers complained to their county supervisor. The 
result was a change in county policy. From now on, taxpayers erroneously 
identified as delinquent can get a public apology from the tax collector in the 
form of a published retraction. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mindful of Image 
</P>
<P>
The <LOCATION>Los Angeles County</LOCATION> tax collector's office, mindful of its image, recently 
led a successful lobbying effort in <LOCATION>Sacramento</LOCATION> that led to a change in state 
law allowing counties to delay publication of the lists for up to a year in 
order to ensure their accuracy. 
</P>
<P>
The county is required by state law to publish the lists of delinquent 
taxpayers. But it does not make the same effort to notify those who are due 
refunds. 
</P>
<P>
About 2,500 taxpayers a year are believed to overpay their taxes but never 
receive refunds because the county cannot find them. Unclaimed money is 
deposited into the county treasury after a four-year waiting period. 
</P>
<P>
This year, the coffers were boosted by <MONEY>$479,626</MONEY> in overpaid property taxes, 
including <MONEY>$7,387</MONEY> due a single unwitting taxpayer. 
</P>
<P>
County officials said it would be unfair for the general taxpayer to bear the 
expense of tracking down taxpayers who, in the words of one official, are "poor 
record keepers." They said it is the taxpayers' responsibility to keep track of 
how much they pay. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Published Each <DATE>September</DATE> 
</P>
<P>
As for the county's delinquency lists, nobody knows how many taxpayers' names 
end up there mistakenly. The lists are published every <DATE>September</DATE> in community 
newspapers, and nearly 100,000 names appeared last year. 
</P>
<P>
Tax officials say mistakes are inevitable because of the sheer volume of 
property tax bills -- a staggering 2.5 million -- and the complexity of the tax 
system. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Barbara Sanchez</PERSON>, manager of the tax collector's secured property division, said 
she "would be surprised if I have 50 people" a year complain that their names 
were published in error. Until now, the tax collector has sent letters of 
apology to taxpayers "and to whomever they tell us they want us to write," 
including gossipy neighbors, Assistant Tax Collector <PERSON>David Collins</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
That was not enough for Supervisor <PERSON>Pete Schabarum</PERSON>. He recently won his 
colleagues' approval to require the tax collector to publish an apology when 
requested by a taxpayer. Tax Collector <PERSON>Sandra Davis</PERSON> said her office will 
determine whether an error has been made. Wording of the apology has not been 
worked out. 
</P>
<P>
Schabarum proposed the new policy after complaints from several constituents, 
including <PERSON>Fowler</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
Fowler, owner of apartment buildings in <LOCATION>Claremont</LOCATION>, said he saw his name on the 
list published in his community paper, the <ORGANIZATION>Claremont Courier</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
He said he paid his taxes in <DATE>December, 1987</DATE>, but because of a processing error, 
received a delinquency notice in the mail the following <DATE>June</DATE>, the month the tax 
collector sends notices to delinquent taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
Forgetting that he had paid, he sent another check. Perusing his financial 
records the next day, he found proof of his earlier payment and stopped payment 
on the second check. 
</P>
<P>
"How many other citizens have paid twice under such circumstances?" he wrote 
<PERSON>Schabarum</PERSON>. "If the county records show I'm delinquent, and I don't have an 
infallible system and am busy, as well as basically compliant, I'm inclined to 
pay." 
</P>
<P>
Tax Collector <PERSON>Davis</PERSON>, in a letter of response to <PERSON>Schabarum</PERSON>, said <PERSON>Fowler</PERSON> was at 
least partly responsible for the mix-up. 
</P>
<P>
"<PERSON>Mr. Fowler</PERSON> did not review his records before taking action and sent a check to 
cover the delinquencies. Had he determined that payment was made and so advised 
this office, research would have uncovered the processing error and it could 
have been corrected so that no default or published notice would have 
occurred." 
</P>
<P>
But <PERSON>Fowler</PERSON> and two other taxpayers interviewed said they tried for months to 
clear up the matter with the tax collector before contacting <PERSON>Schabarum</PERSON>, whose 
office resolved the problems within a few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to the tax collector's office, <PERSON>Fowler</PERSON> said, "Most of them treated me 
as if they were not in the tax collector's office, but in the felony division 
of the <ORGANIZATION>Sheriff's Department</ORGANIZATION>, and I was the culprit." 
</P>
<P>
Mindful of its image, the tax collector's office recently began training its 
operators in "telephone etiquette." In addition, the <ORGANIZATION>Board of Supervisors</ORGANIZATION> has 
allocated <MONEY>$4 million</MONEY> to add phone lines and increase staff in the tax 
collector's office. 
</P>
<P>
"Taxpayers do not want taxes raised, but they want immediate service," said 
<PERSON>Sanchez</PERSON>, pointing out that the tax collector's office processes more than 4 
million tax payments a year and is still not fully computerized. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Karen Greenbaum-Maya</PERSON>, another <LOCATION>Claremont</LOCATION> taxpayer who wrote <PERSON>Schabarum</PERSON>, said she 
was "outraged" to find her name on the delinquency list. 
</P>
<P>
"That's not how I wanted to appear in the paper, as delinquent in my taxes," 
she said. "I am a psychologist, and I work in the area where I live, and that's 
embarrassing." 
</P>
<P>
And, "as far as we knew," it was unfounded, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Greenbaum-Maya admitted that she was not entirely blameless. She and her 
husband indeed owed taxes, but she said they were unaware of it until they saw 
their name in the newspaper. She said she never received a notice in the mail 
in <DATE>June</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Greenbaum-Maya said that after she saw her name in the paper, "we did the 
conscientious thing" and immediately called and wrote the tax collector's 
office to try to clear up the matter. 
</P>
<P>
Despite her efforts, she said her and her husband's name appeared in the 
newspaper a second time. The lists are published three consecutive weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The taxpayers have mixed views about a public apology. 
</P>
<P>
"The county uses its money poorly enough as it is," <PERSON>Fowler</PERSON> said. "The issue is 
really at the front end. Why did this whole thing happen in the first place?" 
</P>
<P>
Greenbaum-Maya and <ORGANIZATION>Romero-Gomez</ORGANIZATION> said they welcome retractions. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the fair thing to do," <PERSON>Greenbaum-Maya</PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Mexico to raise oil prices for customers in the Western Hemisphere</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ANDERSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   <ORGANIZATION>Pemex</ORGANIZATION>, the government oil monopoly, said
<DATE>Friday</DATE> it will raise prices for crude oil exports to its customers
in the <LOCATION>Western Hemisphere</LOCATION> on <DATE>Sept. 1</DATE> but prices will remain
unchanged for exports to <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>.
   The announcement was made as the secretary-general of the
<ORGANIZATION>Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Ahmed Subroto</PERSON> of
<LOCATION>Indonesia</LOCATION>, completed a three-day visit and said <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> had agreed
not to increase its crude exports.
   Mexico does not belong to <ORGANIZATION>OPEC</ORGANIZATION> but closely follows the 13-member
organization's pricing and production guidelines.
   <ORGANIZATION>Pemex</ORGANIZATION> said its <ORGANIZATION>Petroleum Foreign Trade Committee</ORGANIZATION> had authorized
the price increases for countries in the <LOCATION>Western Hemisphere</LOCATION> ``to
align prices for exports of Mexican crude with those prevailing in
the international market.''
   Sales to customers in the <LOCATION>Western Hemisphere</LOCATION> averaged 717,000
barrels daily between <DATE>January</DATE> and <DATE>July</DATE> _ <PERCENT>54 percent</PERCENT> of <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>'s
petroleum exports during that period, according to <ORGANIZATION>Pemex</ORGANIZATION>. The
<LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> is the main client.
   <ORGANIZATION>Pemex</ORGANIZATION> said the price increases will be <MONEY>10 cents</MONEY> per barrel for
light Isthmus crude and <MONEY>30 cents</MONEY> for heavy Maya crude because of a
``technical adjustment in export formulas.''
   In <DATE>July</DATE>, Isthmus sold for <MONEY>$13.78</MONEY> a barrel and <ORGANIZATION>Maya</ORGANIZATION> for <MONEY>$11.21</MONEY> a
barrel in the <LOCATION>Western Hemisphere</LOCATION>.
   Subroto told a news conference that ``<LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> reiterated its
collaboration with the petroleum cartel not to increase its
production and to search for the stabilization of the market.''
   He said he was convinced of <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>'s commitment to work with
<ORGANIZATION>OPEC</ORGANIZATION> and he hoped ``soon the world petroleum market will be
stabilized.''
   The government news agency <ORGANIZATION>Notimex</ORGANIZATION> announced <DATE>Friday</DATE> that <ORGANIZATION>Pemex</ORGANIZATION>
has begun exports of special diesel fuel to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> with
a 30 million-liter shipment from the <LOCATION>Gulf of Mexico</LOCATION> port of
<LOCATION>Tampico</LOCATION>. A liter is equal to 1.06 liquid quarts.
   Notimex did not identify the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> customer but said it was ``one
of the most important <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> petroleum companies.''

FT  17 MAR 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): The cost of a fair
deal - Products appealing to consumer conscience
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two years ago, <PERSON>Justino Peck</PERSON>, a cocoa farmer from a small village near the
Maya mountains in <LOCATION>Belize</LOCATION>, abandoned his crop following a collapse in
international prices. Now he is back in production with a three-year
contract to supply cocoa beans to <ORGANIZATION>Green &amp; Black</ORGANIZATION>'s chocolate company in
<LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>.
Maya Gold chocolate made from <PERSON>Peck</PERSON>'s beans went on sale in 80 supermarkets
in the UK <DATE>last week</DATE> as the first product to carry a seal of approval from
<LOCATION>Fairtrade</LOCATION>, an organisation which is trying to ensure workers in the Third
World get a better deal.
In <DATE>July</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>Royal Society</ORGANIZATION> for the Protection of Animals (<ORGANIZATION>RSPCA</ORGANIZATION>) plans to
issue its own label - Freedom Food - for meat and eggs which have been
produced, transported and slaughtered in a humane way.
Both organisations hope to capitalise on the conscience of the <DATE>1990s</DATE>
consumer who fills his supermarket trolley with environmentally friendly
washing powder and recycled toilet paper.
A poll by <ORGANIZATION>NOP</ORGANIZATION> for Christian Aid conducted in <DATE>October last year</DATE> found that 68
per cent of the 1,000 adults surveyed said they would be willing to pay more
for products that guaranteed a fair return to farmers and workers in the
<LOCATION>Third World</LOCATION>. The average amount consumers were prepared to pay was 25p on an
item that normally costs Pounds 1.
The <ORGANIZATION>RSPCA</ORGANIZATION>'s own research has indicated that 30 per cent of those polled
would pay up to 50 per cent more for meat from an animal that had been well
treated.
Maya Gold chocolate costs Pounds 1.55 for 100g compared with 65p for the
same amount of <ORGANIZATION>Cadbury</ORGANIZATION>'s Bourneville chocolate, but the company says it
contains three times as much cocoa. <ORGANIZATION>Green &amp; Black</ORGANIZATION>'s is paying the <LOCATION>Belize</LOCATION>
farmers 48p per lb for their cocoa beans which is higher than the current
free market price of 41.5p per lb.
Similarly, <ORGANIZATION>Cafedirect</ORGANIZATION>, a high-quality ground coffee containing beans from
<LOCATION>Costa Rica</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Nicaragua</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Peru</LOCATION>, pays its suppliers up to double the
market rate paid by other companies. <ORGANIZATION>Cafedirect</ORGANIZATION>, which has been on the
supermarket shelves for two years, will carry the Fairtrade mark from <DATE>April</DATE>.
Fairtrade is looking at other products such as tea and honey, but these are
not likely to capture more than a very small share of the mass market.
Although many consumers say in market research they want to pay more for a
'conscience' product, it is hard to get them to part with their money.
The Co-operative Wholesale Society has been looking for several years to
launch its own brand of 'conscience' products such as coffee, tea and honey.
But 'when it comes to the crunch, particularly in a recession, people are
looking for bargains', says <PERSON>Martin Henderson</PERSON> from the Co-op.
The Co-op was the first supermarket chain to carry <ORGANIZATION>Cafedirect</ORGANIZATION>, but has found
that sales have been disappointing. 'We're looking for a bigger volume
market to move into, but we haven't cracked it yet,' says <PERSON>Henderson</PERSON>.
The most important problem faced by retailers and companies looking to
appeal to peoples' consciences is in how to turn aspirations into hard cash.
<PERSON>Mike Sharp</PERSON>, marketing manager for the <ORGANIZATION>RSPCA</ORGANIZATION>, says the problem lies in public
confusion over claims made by certain products. Consumers are also cynical
about being offered another marketing ploy.
The <ORGANIZATION>RSPCA</ORGANIZATION> is hoping that its Freedom Food mark will not only occupy a niche
but also cover as wide a part of the market as possible.
'The consumer response has been very positive because the <ORGANIZATION>RSPCA</ORGANIZATION> is trusted
as an independent party,' said Sharp. The label will be issued on pork and
eggs in <DATE>July</DATE> and move to all other products derived from animals in the
longer term.
<PERSON>Richard Adams</PERSON>, who runs the New Consumer Organisation, a research group,
thinks the way to encourage the public to buy 'conscience' products could be
to group them in a separate High Street store. He is currently conducting a
feasibility study.

   LEISURE &amp; ARTS -- Theater:
   Robert Wilson Adapts Ibsen
   ----
   By Edwin Wilson
</HL>
<DATE>

WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A9
</SO>
<LP>
   Cambridge, Mass. -- One night last summer when director
Robert Wilson was preparing his new production of "When We
Dead Awaken" for the American Repertory Theater (ART) here,
he was sitting in a restaurant explaining to a friend that he
felt such a heavy, serious play needed something to lighten
the mood at times. His attention was then attracted by the
face of a tall, lean, elegant figure at another table. The
man's expression had just the kind of infectious warmth and
charm Mr. Wilson had in mind. Immediately he made his way
across the room and introduced himself.
   "I'm Robert Wilson," he said. "I'm Honi Coles," said the
other. The two men, one America's premier avant-garde
director, the other America's premiere tap dancer, had not
only never met, neither had ever heard of the other. Thus Mr.
Wilson, who has often operated on sheer instinct and
intuition, introduced into "When We Dead Awaken" three "knee
plays," short interludes in which the inimitable Mr. Coles
sings, recites poetry and leads a chorus line in a time step.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "When We Dead Awaken" was <PERSON>Henrik Ibsen</PERSON>'s final play,
written in <DATE>1899</DATE> when the Norwegian playwright was 72 years
old. It is the story of Rubek (<PERSON>Alvin Epstein</PERSON>), a famous
sculptor in his final years, living in a sterile marriage
with his lusty young wife, <PERSON>Maya</PERSON> (<PERSON>Stephanie Roth</PERSON>). During the
play, <PERSON>Irene</PERSON> (played by two actresses, <PERSON>Elzbieta Czyzewska</PERSON> and
<PERSON>Sheryl Sutton</PERSON>) shows upyears before she had been the model
for <ORGANIZATION>Rubek</ORGANIZATION>'s masterpiece. But though she posed nude for him,
and was in love with him, he refused to express his love to
herthe artist in him, he claims, would not allow it. The
play, perhaps <ORGANIZATION>Ibsen</ORGANIZATION>'s most autobiographical, offers a
reappraisal of the artist's role; does the artist, in
fulfilling his mission, have the right to deny human
relationships and responsibilities?
   Juxtaposed with the abstract, antiseptic world of the
artist is the sensual, predatory world represented by a bear
hunter (<PERSON>Mario Arrambide</PERSON>) who appears on the scene. A man who
despises the arts, he immediately proves attractive to <ORGANIZATION>Maya</ORGANIZATION>.
In the end, the bear hunter and Maya leave together to follow
earthly pursuits, while <PERSON>Rubek</PERSON> and <PERSON>Irene</PERSON> climb to the top of a
snow-covered mountain -- two people spiritually dead who will
be awakened in the afterlife to which they move when they are
buried in an avalanche.
   Taking place at the same time as the production of "When
We Dead Awaken" at ART is an arresting exhibit at <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>'s
Museum of Fine Arts of <PERSON>Robert Wilson</PERSON> materials, including
artifacts from his productions, drawings of scene designs
(works of art themselves) and a videotape documenting his
career and one of his productions. On the video, a frequent
collaborator of <PERSON>Mr. Wilson</PERSON>'s, the German playwright <PERSON>Heiner
Muller</PERSON>, comments that words are unimportant, even an
anathema, to <PERSON>Mr. Wilson</PERSON> --  "It's what happens between the
words that interests him," <PERSON>Mr. Muller</PERSON> says, and adds: "His is
a theater of experience, not discourse."
   <PERSON>Mr. Wilson</PERSON>'s theater pieces deconstruct the surface of
characters and language. Speeches are broken up, partly
spoken by the characters, but with other words and phrases
reproduced on tape; some words are spoken at an arbitrarily
high pitch and others normally, and certain passages are
repeated over and over again. "When We Dead Awaken" is one of
<ORGANIZATION>Ibsen</ORGANIZATION>'s shortest plays, but <PERSON>Robert Brustein</PERSON>, artistic
director of ART, mindful of <PERSON>Mr. Wilson</PERSON>'s aversion to
discourse, has developed an English version that has cut even
that brief text in half. The result is not a production of
"When We Dead Awaken," but a <PERSON>Robert Wilson</PERSON> theater piece
"inspired by" or "in response to" the Ibsen play. In place of
character, plot, emotional confrontations, <PERSON>Mr. Wilson</PERSON>
substitutes his stage pictures, which, it must be said, are
the most exciting to be found anywhere in theater today.
   The setting is monumental-giant paintings of Norwegian
landscapes that take up the entire stage. Characters assume
poses like statues, moving one hand slowly, and sometimes
turning in place like mannequins on a turntable. As always
with <PERSON>Mr. Wilson</PERSON>, the lighting is magical: Characters'
sculptured faces are isolated in circles of white light
against a black void; beams cut across the stage at arbitrary
angles; layers of light turn the entire stage into a stunning
chiaroscuro.
   Aiding <PERSON>Mr. Wilson</PERSON> in creating the scenery and costumes is
designer <PERSON>John Conklin</PERSON>. Along with the striking visual images
there is a sound score made up of voices, wind, and
electronic effects created by <PERSON>Hans Peter Kuhn</PERSON>. And
interspersed with the major sections of the piece are <PERSON>Mr.
Coles</PERSON>'s knee plays. In one, for example, <PERSON>Mr. Coles</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mr.
Epstein</PERSON> sing a blues song and then the entire company comes
on stage to do a tap routine. In true Brechtian fashion, the
somber figures who have been moving in slow motion like
statues suddenly break into a time step.
   What is the final effect of all this? The story itself,
including what we assume Ibsen meant for us to get out of it,
is only partially realized. The irresistible attraction that
the ribald, animalistic bear hunter has for <ORGANIZATION>Maya</ORGANIZATION> is made
abundantly clear, as is the contrast between this kind of
life and the rarefied spiritual life of Rubek. What is not so
clear is the idea of an artist at the end of his days
confronting his own past and the premises on which he has
based his career. The anguish that the spurned <PERSON>Irene</PERSON> has
suffered and the agony of the artist coming to terms with the
price he has paid for the choices he has made are not fully
realized, perhaps cannot be realized in <PERSON>Mr. Wilson</PERSON>'s scheme.
   At the same time, "When We Dead Awaken," with its
mysticism, its elegiac lyricism, its vast Norwegian
landscapes, make a fitting background against which <PERSON>Mr.
Wilson</PERSON> has created one of his astonishing theater pieces. In
his inimitable fashion he develops a series of tableaux
vivants that are part painting, part choreography, part
architecture, part "son et lumiere", but blended into a whole
that ultimately cannot be explained, only experienced.
   "When We Dead Awaken" is a co-production of the ART and
the <ORGANIZATION>Alley Theater</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION>, and is underwritten by <ORGANIZATION>AT&amp;T</ORGANIZATION>
On-Stage. It continues here through this <DATE>weekend</DATE> and plays in
<LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION> <DATE>May 22-26</DATE>.

FT  02 APR 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Taking the eggs out of Easter - Philippa
Davenport makes an alternative to pudding for an Easter lunch
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
On Easter day in <LOCATION>Greece</LOCATION>, the usual 'good morning' greeting is replaced by
'Christ is risen' as children crack their hard-boiled eggs against those of
their companions in a spring-time version of conkers.
In <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>, eggs tend to be soft-boiled for serving at the Easter breakfast
table. For years, though, I had a childish horror of fresh eggs cooked
lightly. Growing up at a time of rationing when powdered eggs were the norm,
I was repelled by the sticky yolks and semi-jellied whites of soft-boiled
eggs.
One memorable Easter, I went to a tea party at the house of some friends
where, with leaden heart, I saw the table was laid with an egg cup and spoon
at every setting. 'A special treat,' our hostess smiled as we sat down and
the eggs were brought in. My misery deepened when I realised there was no
bread and butter on hand to blot up the worst excesses of eggy liquefaction.
I had no choice but to crack into the beastly thing. I raised my spoon and
bashed the shell ferociously, hoping to spill some of its contents. What
blessed relief to find the egg was not really an egg at all. It had been
blown out and refilled with melted chocolate.
Although it was a harmless, sheep-in-wolf's-clothing type of prank, it was
the sort of surprise I prefer to live without. In fact, I have been nervous
of Easter eggs ever since - unless they are made by <ORGANIZATION>Faberge</ORGANIZATION>. I offer you,
instead, an undisguised and egg-less chocolate confection.
CHOCOLATE &amp; PRUNE PETITS FOURS (makes about 16)
These are fiddly to make and not worth attempting by the impatient or those
in a hurry. But they are unusual. One or two per person makes an attractive
alternative to pudding at the end of a fine meal, served with coffee and
perhaps brandy or port.
To mould the chocolate shells, you will need some small fluted paper cases
of the sort sold by kitchenware shops and some hardware stores for making
mini-muffins, chocolates and other confectionery.
For the chocolate shells: 5oz best bitter chocolate;  1/2 oz unsalted
butter.
For the filling: 6oz big squashy prunes; 1 1/2 oz sultanas; 1 1/2 oz
currants; 3 fl oz or so each of port and water; 1 tub creme fraiche or
clotted cream; a little cocoa powder.
Put the dried fruits and liquids into a flame-proof casserole with a heavy,
well-fitting lid. Bring very slowly to simmering point. Cover and cook over
the lowest possible flame for one hour, stirring occasionally, until the
fruit is very tender and has absorbed most of the liquid.
Set aside, still covered, for 1 1/2 hours until cold. Then, stone the
prunes, whizz all the fruits and their juices to a rich dark puree, and
refrigerate.
Dice the chocolate and melt it with one teaspoon of warm water in a bowl
placed over a pan of barely-simmering water. Away from the heat, beat in the
butter.
Using a teaspoon, line the paper cases with chocolate, smoothing it across
the base and up the sides right to the top. Spread it thickly: a good ratio
of chocolate to filling makes for good eating, and stout walls are less
fragile and easier to un-mould than thin ones. Chill on a plate.
When the chocolate shells have set solid, fill and un-mould them. To guard
against the chocolate softening messily in the warmth of the kitchen or the
heat of your hands, take the shells out of the refrigerator just one at a
time, work on each one quickly, and put it back in the fridge before
starting on the next. Do not overdo the filling: two-thirds full is better
than brimfull.
Spread a small spoonful of the rich, dark prune puree across the base, add a
snowy covering of cream, and shake a pinch of cocoa powder over the top.
Strip off the paper carefully, loosening it round the rim and peeling it
downwards.
Keep the petits fours in the fridge until you are ready to serve them, and
hand them round on the chilled plate on which they have been stored.
<ORGANIZATION>Green &amp; Black</ORGANIZATION>'s organic chocolate, made with 70 per cent cocoa solids, dark
and agreeably un-sweet, was an instant hit when launched a few years ago.
But it was difficult to buy unless you lived near a health food shop. Now,
it has reached the supermarkets; it is available at <ORGANIZATION>Safeway</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Sainsbury</ORGANIZATION>,
with Waitrose and <ORGANIZATION>Tesco</ORGANIZATION> to follow soon.
Just in time for <LOCATION>Easter</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Green &amp; Black</ORGANIZATION> is bringing out another chocolate
that looks set for success. Again made with 70 per cent cocoa solids, this
one is called <ORGANIZATION>Maya Gold</ORGANIZATION> and is flavoured with orange, vanilla and allspice.
Maya Gold is, moreover, the first product to go on sale bearing not only the
<ORGANIZATION>Soil Association</ORGANIZATION> symbol but also the mark of the <ORGANIZATION>Fairtrade Foundation</ORGANIZATION> in
recognition of <ORGANIZATION>Green &amp; Black</ORGANIZATION>'s long-term trading commitment to the Maya
Indian cocoa growers of <LOCATION>Belize</LOCATION>.
Launch stockists are <ORGANIZATION>Sainsbury</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Tesco</ORGANIZATION>, the Co-op and <ORGANIZATION>Asda</ORGANIZATION>. A 100g bar costs
Pounds 1.95.

FRANCISCO SARAVIA, Mexico 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's easy to miss the turnoff for <ORGANIZATION>Francisco Saravia</ORGANIZATION>. Pick the wrong time to 
pass one of the trucks that creep along the two-lane highway, belching smoke at 
trailing motorists, and you will have passed the entrance. A small woods hides 
the village from the main road. 
</P>
<P>
But follow the right strip of pavement for a few curving miles and you might 
believe you have driven straight out of rural <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> into a <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> suburb. 
Instead of the whitewashed cubes with narrow slits of glass topped by 
corrugated metal -- typical housing in Mexican villages -- homes on the main 
street of <PERSON>Francisco Saravia</PERSON> have L-shaped designs, picture windows and tiles or 
shingles over sloping roofs. Many also have pickup trucks with <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> 
license plates in the driveway. 
</P>
<P>
After all, <PERSON>Francisco Saravia</PERSON> and its neighboring villages around <LOCATION>Lake Chapala</LOCATION> 
in west-central <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> are the source of a large part of the <LOCATION>Southern 
California</LOCATION> labor force. Villagers spend their youth picking fruit, washing 
dishes and sweeping factory floors in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, then come home to <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> to 
build the houses they'll live in when their children take their turn north of 
the border. Here, emigration is a tradition developed over generations. 
</P>
<P>
As <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>'s economic crisis and the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> shortage of unskilled labor continue, 
new emigrants are joining this traditional flow: urbanites who can make in an 
hour at an <ORGANIZATION>American McDonald's</ORGANIZATION> what they'd earn in a day in <LOCATION>Mexico City</LOCATION>; 
Indians who barely speak Spanish; Central Americans, tired of life in southern 
<LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>'s refugee camps and skeptical that they can ever go home. Together, they 
are making labor one of <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>'s most important exports. 
</P>
<P>
"Every day you run into people who are going (to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>)," said <PERSON>Juan 
Manuel Sandoval Palacios</PERSON>, general coordinator of the Permanent Seminar on 
Chicano and <ORGANIZATION>Border Studies</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> City-based group of scholars. 
</P>
<P>
"In <LOCATION>San Juan</LOCATION> del Rio (a town northwest of <LOCATION>Mexico City</LOCATION>), I talked to 117 workers 
who planned to go in <DATE>July</DATE> -- and that is not a traditional migrant area," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The lure of paychecks in dollars has become irresistible for many Mexicans as 
jobs in their own country become scarcer and lower-paying. For the past eight 
years, <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> has been trying to recover from a borrowing spree that left it 
the second-most indebted country in the developing world. 
</P>
<P>
International bankers and officials of industrialized countries have praised 
<LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>'s economic reforms -- reductions in government spending, deregulation 
and privatization. However, those reforms have worsened an already bleak 
employment situation. 
</P>
<P>
The government has cut the federal deficit in part by laying off bureaucrats. 
Another approach has been to eliminate subsidies by selling hundreds of 
unprofitable state-owned companies to private business. The new owners' first 
move toward profitability is nearly always to trim payrolls. 
</P>
<P>
Trade tariffs have also been reduced. Faced with increased competition from 
imports, factories have scaled back production as markets shrink. Or they have 
increased productivity, thereby cutting costs to meet international prices. 
Either way, they need fewer workers. 
</P>
<P>
Today's sacrifices eventually will result in a sound economy, more investment 
and, finally, jobs, said economist <PERSON>Rogelio Ramirez</PERSON> de la O. Meanwhile, the 
Mexican economy is nowhere close to generating enough jobs to employ the 1 
million new workers who enter the labor force each year. 
</P>
<P>
With job applicants lining up outside their gates, employers have little 
incentive to raise wages or increase worker benefits. The spending power of the 
minimum wage -- which about one-third of the labor force earns -- has been 
halved during the past eight years and now stands at about <MONEY>$4</MONEY> a day. 
</P>
<P>
If options are limited for Mexicans, even fewer opportunities exist for Central 
American refugees. Working in clandestine factories near the <LOCATION>Mexico City</LOCATION> 
airport or tending 2-square-yard market stalls in southern <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> refugee 
camps, many wait for word from relatives in <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"What does he say? When can we come?" asked <PERSON>Eulalia Cristobal</PERSON> in halting 
Spanish, inquiring after her son, <LOCATION>Diego</LOCATION>, who was granted political asylum in 
<LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> last year. Diego's attorneys from <ORGANIZATION>El Rescate</ORGANIZATION>, a public interest law 
firm in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, had hoped that the case in which he won asylum would 
establish right of asylum for all Quiche Indians from <LOCATION>Guatemala</LOCATION>, allowing him 
to send for his family. However, the ruling applies only to him. 
</P>
<P>
His mother is eager to leave the <ORGANIZATION>Maya Tecum</ORGANIZATION> refugee camp in the Mexican state 
of <LOCATION>Campeche</LOCATION>, the family's latest stop in the five years since their hometown in 
<LOCATION>Huehuetenango</LOCATION> province was burned by the army. "I am from the mountains, and it 
is so hot here," said <PERSON>Cristobal</PERSON>, a short, thin woman with braided gray hair who 
wears the subtlely striped, straight, ankle-length skirt that is traditional in 
northern <LOCATION>Guatemala</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
About the only work available for refugees in this impoverished area is heavy 
manual labor, not the kind of jobs for which aging women are hired. She tries 
to earn money selling needles, thread and plastic trinkets at an improvised 
market of stick huts in the center of the camp. Sales are slow, she said, 
because no one else has money either. 
</P>
<P>
Her husband, <PERSON>Cristobal Diego</PERSON>, is helping to build another camp that will have a 
water pump for every four houses -- an improvement over <LOCATION>Maya Tecum</LOCATION>, where women 
must line up once a day at a water truck. Because of his work, if they decide 
to stay in <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>, they will be allowed to move to the new camp. 
</P>
<P>
Like many Guatemalans who eagerly ask about conditions in their home country, 
the family's first choice would be to move back. However, the same fear for 
their safety that drove them across the border causes them to hesitate. 
</P>
<P>
Continuing north is their best option. 
</P>
<P>
Mexican Indians from the tropical south -- the poorest region of the country -- 
are also pushing north. 
</P>
<P>
During the <DATE>1950s</DATE>, the Mixtecs of the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> state of <LOCATION>Oaxaca</LOCATION> began working on 
the coffee plantations in <LOCATION>Veracruz</LOCATION> on the <LOCATION>Gulf of Mexico</LOCATION>. Within a decade, they 
were also picking crops and peddling wares on the <LOCATION>Baja California</LOCATION> peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
Now, they form an important part of the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> agricultural work force in 
northern <LOCATION>San Diego County</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fresno</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Santa Rosa</LOCATION> and reach as far north as Salem, 
<LOCATION>Ore.</LOCATION>, said <PERSON>Lilia Marcela Moreno</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Mexico City</LOCATION> researcher who studies 
emigration. 
</P>
<P>
The Mixtecs, for centuries an isolated group that has kept its own language and 
customs, are remarkable because of the extent to which their emigration is a 
cooperative, community effort, she said. A community will pool resources to 
send one or two people to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>. That has allowed the Mixtecs, 
among the poorest of <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>'s poor, to become migrants. 
</P>
<P>
Before, that option was available only to the middle class of rural <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>, 
those who could raise <MONEY>$300</MONEY> or more for bus fare to <LOCATION>Tijuana</LOCATION> and a coyote, or 
guide, for the perils of a covert border crossing. As workers from towns with a 
migrant tradition, such as <PERSON>Francisco Saravia</PERSON>, moved to better-paying jobs in 
factories and services including as gardening and restaurant work, the Mixtecs 
took their places in the fields. 
</P>
<P>
Today, workers from traditional migrant towns usually have legal resident 
status in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> or can easily obtain it through relatives who live 
there, <PERSON>Moreno</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
The newer emigrants are those most likely to be affected by laws that punish 
employers who knowingly hire people who are not legally permitted to work in 
the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, she said. But even they are not discouraged. 
</P>
<P>
"If anything, you just get new flows (of workers) to places where the 
(<ORGANIZATION>Immigration and Naturalization Service</ORGANIZATION>) does not have much presence," said 
<PERSON>Francisco Javier Guerrero</PERSON>, another participant in the border studies seminars. 
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult to believe that emigration will stop," he said. "The flows will 
continue to increase."

   A man who slipped into a coma after drinking a

life-support equipment.
   Maximo <PERSON>Rene Menendez</PERSON>, 25, collapsed <DATE>July 26</DATE> after drinking from
a six-ounce bottle of Pony <LOCATION>Malta</LOCATION> de <LOCATION>Bavaria</LOCATION> that contained many
times the lethal dose of cocaine. Drinking just one gram of the
drug can be fatal, investigators said.
   ``His life support was disconnected at <TIME>5:02 p.m.</TIME> and he expired
at <TIME>5:15</TIME>,'' said <PERSON>Victor Maya</PERSON>, executive director of <ORGANIZATION>AMI Kendall
Regional Medical Center</ORGANIZATION>. ``There was absolutely nothing that could
be done for this man.''
   Menendez's family had a court order to cut off his life support
on <DATE>Aug. 13</DATE> after neurologists concluded he had no brain activity.
But his leg moved and he took shallow breaths after the respirator
was turned off the next day.
   Doctors reconnected the equipment and the family asked for a

<PERSON>Menendez</PERSON> was brain dead without hope of recovery, <PERSON>Maya</PERSON> said.

   "The issue is settled at a large public meeting that might be likened to a court. 
But no testimony is taken in support of either of the two versions of why the wife has left her husband. 
Instead, the 'disputants' take turns singing insulting songs at each other." 

   So a tribal rite of the central and eastern Eskimo is recorded by <PERSON>Marvin Harris</PERSON> in "Culture, People, Nature," an introduction to anthropology. 
The audience renders judgment by how hard it laughs at each song. 
"Eventually one of the singers gets flustered, and the hooting and hollering raised against him becomes total -- even his relatives have a hard time not laughing." 
The man who loses the song duel usually gives in, <PERSON>Mr. Harris</PERSON> observes, and this solves disputes "independently of abstract principles of justice." 

   What does this have to do with today's events, you wonder? 
I've been perusing anthropology this last little while, plumbing the deeper meaning of spectacles like the one <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON> and <PERSON>Michael Dukakis</PERSON> submit themselves to tonight at <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION>. 
The natives call this peculiar rite a "presidential debate," but it's freighted with far deeper symbolic and mystical meanings. 

   Obviously it has nothing to do with "abstract principles of justice." 
No one pretends the outcome depends on which candidate has the better ideas for advancing the welfare of the Republic. 
On the issues, <PERSON>Sen. Dan Quayle</PERSON> shellacked <PERSON>Sen. Lloyd Bentsen</PERSON>. 
The latter's principal theme was a shopworn economic jingoism that, when adopted by the top of his ticket in the aftermath of the debate, was denounced not only here but in the <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> Post. 
Yet the whole tribe understands that <PERSON>Sen. Quayle</PERSON> "lost" and <PERSON>Sen. Bentsen</PERSON> "won." 
What mystical vibrations tell us this? 

   ---
   Anthropologists have a firm grip on the concept of the ordeal, especially in the passage from one social status to another. 
"Rites of passage are universal," the Britannica instructs us, and archaeology "strongly suggests that they go back to very early times." 
In the archetypical puberty rite, young men and/or women are separated from the tribe to undergo fasting, various humiliations and often real wounds. 
Old clothes are often destroyed and new ones donned; indoctrination is given in social mores and religious beliefs. 
Upon weathering the ordeal, the youngster becomes an adult. 

   Similar rites are involved in ascending to positions of leadership; a new shaman, for example, is expected to work, drink or drug himself into a trance. 
While the <ORGANIZATION>Britannica</ORGANIZATION>'s author disagrees, the early British anthropologist <PERSON>A.M. Hocart</PERSON> "thought that all rites of passage were based on the model of ritual of investiture of kings, in which symbolic killing and rebirth of the new ruler, and sometimes actual killing of the old, were required." 

   The prize for excess in terms of violations required of rulers (as well as in many other things) goes to the high Indian civilizations of meso-America. 
"They offered sacrifices of their own blood," wrote <PERSON>Diego de Landa</PERSON>, the first bishop of Yucatan. 
"Sometimes they scarify certain parts of their bodies, at others they pierced their tongues in a slanting direction from side to side and passed bits of straw through the holes with horrible suffering; others slit the superfluous part of the virile member leaving it as they did their ears." 
Bishop <PERSON>de Landa</PERSON>, recalled to <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> in <DATE>1568</DATE>, went down in history as a book-burner for destroying the Maya codices, an act that seems more understandable as we learn more about their civilization. 

   "The Blood of Kings," <PERSON>Linda Schele</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mary Ellen Miller</PERSON> entitled their book on the Maya. 
They envision the Maya ceremony, with processions of elaborately costumed dancers, musicians, warriors and nobles prepared by days of fasting and steam baths. 
Well into the ceremony the king and queen would come before the assembly to draw their own blood as described by Bishop <PERSON>Landa</PERSON>, collecting it on special bloodletting paper to be burned as an offering. 

   "The participants, already dazed through deprivation, public hysteria and massive blood loss, were culturally conditioned to expect a hallucinatory experience. 
The rising clouds of swirling smoke provided the perfect field in which to see the Vision Serpent; gazing into the smoke, the celebrants may have actually seen it."

   With the advance of civilization, our own culture offers more muted colors to anthropological observers. 
<PERSON>David I. Kertzer</PERSON> ("Ritual, Politics, and Power") notes that political concession speeches unify the tribe. 
J. <PERSON>McIver Weatherford</PERSON> ("Tribes on the Hill") has discovered a richer vein in the swamps of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>. 

   Versailles under <ORGANIZATION>Louis XIV</ORGANIZATION>, he reminds, offered pageants mobilizing the entire French aristocracy, its mistresses and friends and "whole villages of ancillary artisans" -- jewelers, goldsmiths, haberdashers and hairdressers. 
"Because the rituals of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> focus on the written word," he continues, they "induce an insatiable appetite for speech writers, public-relations experts, secretaries, clerks and artisans with related verbal skills. 
The fashions in word usage and the changing manner in which they are presented vary as much as the hair arrangements and styles in silk stockings at the French court." 
<PERSON>Mr. Weatherford</PERSON> sees the fate of Louis XIV as a warning to <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>. 

   Presidential debates are a recent institution, and we're left to our own resources in applying the corpus of anthropology. 
What we seem to have here is some kind of primitive ritual, with simple rules. 
Anyone who wants to be president has to submit to torture by the shamans of the press. 
If you blink, you lose. 

   What this has to do with governing the nation I am not sure; somehow I would rather have <PERSON>Dan Quayle</PERSON> standing by than <PERSON>Tom Brokaw</PERSON> or <PERSON>Morton Downey</PERSON>. 
But it is the way we do things; presumably, like other rites, its function is to make us all feel part of the same tribe.

ZOO ELEPHANT'S DEATH STIRS FUROR; 
</P>
<P>
ANIMALS: HUMANE SOCIETY CRITICIZES SAN DIEGO ZOO OVER ITS 'EXTREMELY DANGEROUS' 
PACHYDERM EXHIBIT. BUT OFFICIALS SCOFF AT HIS STATEMENTS.

<P>
Investigators at the <ORGANIZATION>Humane Society</ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> sent a letter 
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE> to the <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> Zoo charging that its elephant exhibit is inadequate 
and "extremely dangerous" for both the huge mammals and their keepers. 
</P>
<P>
The letter to <PERSON>Doug Meyers</PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION>San Diego Zoological Society</ORGANIZATION>, was 
prompted by the death <DATE>Sunday</DATE> of <ORGANIZATION>Maya</ORGANIZATION>, a 51-year-old Asian elephant that was put 
to death after she fell into a moat and crippled herself. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not question the care Maya received after her tragic fall into the moat, 
nor the fact that euthanasia was the humane decision to make on her behalf," 
wrote <PERSON>David K. Wills</PERSON>, a vice president in the <ORGANIZATION>Humane Society's Department of 
Investigations</ORGANIZATION>. "However, we are concerned as to what steps zoo officials are 
going to take to improve conditions for the surviving elephants." 
</P>
<P>
Wills criticized the exhibit for its uninsulated floors and its lack of heat 
inside the barn, its limited outdoor shelter and its daily reliance upon chains 
to restrain the elephants. In addition, he charged that a catwalk that connects 
two areas of the elephant yard is precariously narrow, and he called for it to 
be widened. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Jeff Jouett</PERSON>, a spokesman for the zoo, acknowledged that the nearly 30-year-old 
elephant yard is "not perfect," but he said the zoo is in the midst of making 
improvements. So far, they have planted shade trees, he said, and replaced 
decaying floor boards with cement. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Jouett</PERSON> said the zoo also plans to widen the catwalk. But he rejected Wills' 
claim that "if the catwalk were widened, <ORGANIZATION>Maya</ORGANIZATION> might still be alive today," 
saying that while no one witnessed her fall, her placement in the moat 
indicated she did not fall off the walkway. Jouett also dismissed Wills' 
assertion that the exhibit, which now houses one African and three Asian 
elephants, is "grossly inadequate." 
</P>
<P>
"It has passed <ORGANIZATION>USDA</ORGANIZATION> inspections, and we'll welcome the <ORGANIZATION>USDA</ORGANIZATION> to come look at it 
again," <PERSON>Jouett</PERSON> said, noting that <ORGANIZATION>Wills</ORGANIZATION> has asked the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Department of 
Agriculture</ORGANIZATION> to investigate the exhibit. He called most of Wills' allegations 
"just exaggerations to catch the public's attention. It makes nice quotes but 
it's just not true." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Dr. Homer Malaby</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>USDA</ORGANIZATION> animal care specialist in <LOCATION>Sacramento</LOCATION>, said he will 
visit the zoo next week to investigate the <ORGANIZATION>Humane Society</ORGANIZATION>'s allegations. Of 
particular interest, he said, was their charge that the animals have no way to 
escape the rain during the day because they are locked out of their barn. 
</P>
<P>
"If the only shelter the animals have from inclement weather is their indoor 
housing facility, and if they're put out every morning and not allowed back in, 
no matter what the weather, then yes, that would be a violation of the Animal 
Welfare Act," <PERSON>Malaby</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
But <PERSON>Jouett</PERSON> said that the barn door is always opened when it rains. 
</P>
<P>
"They only need walk into the barn," he said, characterizing Wills' letter as 
an attempt to drum up negative publicity. "It's the animal ambulance chaser 
syndrome -- take a tragedy and use it to get your name in the paper." 
</P>
<P>
Wills' letter asserts that nearly half of the zoos approved by the <ORGANIZATION>American 
Assn. of Zoological Parks</ORGANIZATION> and Aquariums have abandoned the practice of chaining 
elephants at night. 
</P>
<P>
But <PERSON>Jouett</PERSON> said he was "sure" that was an overstatement -- he has only heard of 
a handful of zoos that don't use chains. In the winter months, he said, the <LOCATION>San 
Diego</LOCATION> Zoo chains its elephants for 16 hours a day, while the rest of the year 
the animals are chained for about 12 hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
"They're chained for the protection of the elephants and the people to make 
sure they don't steal each others' food and to maintain the safety of the 
keepers," <PERSON>Jouett</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
Jouett called Wills' contention that the elephant barn should be heated 
"intentional misrepresentation." 
</P>
<P>
"The temperature in the elephant barn is not cold," he said. Even during the 
recent frigid weather, he said, when the barn is closed at night "a person 
could walk in there and break a sweat. We have four huge animals that are like 
furnaces -- four huge masses of body heat. Elephants have a problem staying 
cool, not staying warm. It's not a concern."
