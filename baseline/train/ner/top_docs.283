   A woman who said a wild dog snatched
and ate her newborn child has been found innocent of murder.
   The court decision closes the book on an 8-year-old case that
divided <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> and captured headlines worldwide.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Northern Territory Court of Criminal Appeal</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Darwin</LOCATION> on
<DATE>Thursday</DATE> overturned <PERSON>Lindy Chamberlain</PERSON>'s sentence of life
imprisonment with hard labor. She spent about four years in jail.
   It also quashed the conviction of her husband, <PERSON>Michael</PERSON>, a pastor
for the <ORGANIZATION>Seventh Day Adventist Church</ORGANIZATION>, on charges of being an
accessory to murder.
   <PERSON>Mrs. Chamberlain</PERSON>, who was born in <LOCATION>New Zealand</LOCATION>, became a
household name in <DATE>1980</DATE> when she said a dingo, or native Australian
dog, carried off her 6-week-old daughter <PERSON>Azaria</PERSON> while the family
camped in the <LOCATION>Outback</LOCATION> near <ORGANIZATION>Ayers Rock</ORGANIZATION>, a sacred aboriginal site.
   Replete with rumors of black magic and a suicide that led to a
break in the case, the <PERSON>Chamberlain</PERSON> story made Page 1 in newspapers
across <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> and elsewhere. All Australians seem to have an
opinion on the woman's story.
   In <DATE>1987</DATE>, she was pardoned but her conviction was not overturned.
<DATE>Thursday</DATE>'s innocent verdict finally sealed the case shut.
   Gasps filled the courtroom when the decision was announced.
<PERSON>Michael Chamberlain</PERSON> clasped his hands to his head and wept. His
wife, who had been staring at the judges, slumped in her seat.
   ``The law of the land holds the Chamberlains to be innocent,''
said the ruling.
   The Chamberlains' defense attorney had accused the <ORGANIZATION>Northern
Territory</ORGANIZATION> government, which originally prosecuted the pair, of
waging a ``modern-day witchunt.''
   The lawyer, <PERSON>Stuart Tipple</PERSON>, said the Chamberlains were waiting to
see whether the government would pay the couple compensation before
deciding on any civil action. Earlier, he said the couple was
seeking about <MONEY>$750,000</MONEY>.
   After the verdict, <PERSON>Mrs. Chamberlain</PERSON>, a tiny woman in high-heeled
red shoes, was thronged by curious onlookers as she strode with
straightened shoulders from the courthouse.
   The crowd clamored for a closer look as the couple made their
way through the large crowd to their car. Construction workers
nearby downed tools and whistled while others jeered.
   The <PERSON>Chamberlain</PERSON> drama began on a cold night in <DATE>August 1980</DATE> when
<PERSON>Mrs. Chamberlain</PERSON> cried out at the family camp side at <ORGANIZATION>Ayers Rock</ORGANIZATION>,
central <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>, ``A dingo's got my baby!''
   At first, the <ORGANIZATION>Chamberlains</ORGANIZATION>' story was believed. But when the
couple went to court, <PERSON>Mrs. Chamberlain</PERSON> was accused of slitting her
baby's throat.
   The baby's body was never found, but bloodstains were found in
the couple's tent.
   On <DATE>Oct. 29, 1982</DATE>, the Chamberlains were found guilty and <PERSON>Mrs.
Chamberlain</PERSON> was sentenced to life in prison, where she to gave
birth to a second daughter, <PERSON>Kahlia</PERSON>. Her husband was sentenced to a
suspended 18-month sentence.
   The couple has two other sons, <PERSON>Aiden</PERSON> and <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>. Although the
prosecution never alleged black magic as a motive, many Australians
have linked the death of baby <LOCATION>Azaria</LOCATION> to witchcraft and satanic
rites, believing the children have mystical names.
   The family denied rumors that the name <PERSON>Azaria</PERSON> meant ``sacrifice
in the wilderness.'' Many Australians also thought it significant
that the death occurred at <ORGANIZATION>Ayers Rock</ORGANIZATION>, sacred to aborigines in one
of the most remote parts of <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>.
   In <DATE>February 1986</DATE>, a remarkable breakthrough in the case came
when a British tourist jumped off the huge monolith to his death.
   Aboriginal trackers investigating the suicide found the tattered
remains of <ORGANIZATION>Azaria</ORGANIZATION>'s jacket, which <PERSON>Mrs. Chamberlain</PERSON> swore the baby
was wearing the night she vanished.
   The discovery of the jacket proved that <PERSON>Mrs. Chamberlain</PERSON> had not
been lying about at least one aspect of her baby's death and
prompted officials to reopen the case.
   Five days after the jacket was found, <PERSON>Mrs. Chamberlain</PERSON> was
released from prison. On <DATE>June 2, 1987</DATE>, a federal judge pardoned her
and said <PERSON>Mrs. Chamberlain</PERSON> may have told the truth when she said the
dingo snatched and ate the baby.
   ``Indeed, the evidence affords the view that a dingo may have
taken her,'' federal <PERSON>Judge Trevor Morling</PERSON> wrote in his opinion.
   But under Australian law, the pardon was as far as <PERSON>Trevor</PERSON> could
go and the Chamberlains returned to court to overturn the
conviction.
   ``There is no satisfaction, no joy, knowing they still believe
you are guilty,'' <PERSON>Mrs. Chamberlain</PERSON> said at the time.
   Although the court case is over, the <PERSON>Chamberlain</PERSON> story will
continue.
   American movie star Meryl Streep recently finished filming a
movie on the case based on a book titled ``Evil Angels.'' The
American release is provisionally called ``A Cry In The Darkness.''

<TEXT>
The spectacular beauty of <ORGANIZATION>Ayers Rock</ORGANIZATION> today holds no reminders of the tragedy
of <PERSON>Azaria Chamberlain</PERSON>, the nine-week-old daughter of <PERSON>Lindy</PERSON> and <PERSON>Michael
Chamberlain</PERSON> who was taken by a dingo at the <ORGANIZATION>Rock</ORGANIZATION>. Azaria's death and the
ensuing legal actions convulsed <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>, culminating in <PERSON>Lindy
Chamberlain</PERSON>'s belated release from jail.
Today the Rock is haunted more by the spectre of mass tourism than by the
ghost of <LOCATION>Azaria</LOCATION>. The campsite and jumble of motels and buildings at the
eastern base of the Rock where the Chamberlains stayed have been largely
done away with; what is left was turned over to the local Aboriginal
community.
The site might as well not exist: tourist buses rumble along the sealed road
and arrive via the western side of the Rock to disgorge their mainly foreign
passengers. Most Australians, facing outrageously high domestic airfares,
find it too expensive to visit the area.
Visitors now stay at <LOCATION>Yulara</LOCATION>, the depressingly soulless resort 18km away from
the Rock which was built to contain the growing number of tourists visiting
this inhospitable but breathtakingly beautiful region of central <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>.
And there, perhaps, lies the rub: the region is becoming easier to visit as
<LOCATION>Yulara</LOCATION> neutralises the brutal climate. No longer do tourists have to brave
campsites and dirt roads to see <ORGANIZATION>Ayers Rock</ORGANIZATION> - now known by its Aboriginal
name, <LOCATION>Uluru</LOCATION> - rising starkly from pancake-flat desert. Visitors flocking to
the Rock arrive by air-conditioned coach or by jet to Connellan airport,
minutes away from <LOCATION>Yulara</LOCATION>.
Visitors are catered to with cool efficiency, from those able to pay the
prices for the five-star Sails in the Desert hotel, complete with Rock
views, to the back-packers staying at the campsite. And organised tours
ferry the tourists out to experience sunrise and sunset en masse.
The problem is that you have to stay at <LOCATION>Yulara</LOCATION> to get the most out of a
visit. It is the only place to stay for 500km in each direction. And with
the cost of taking a hire car to the area so high, it is almost inevitable
that just about every visitor will end up going out to the Rock in a coach.
This is good news for the coach companies based at <LOCATION>Yulara</LOCATION>, but bad news for
the tourist hoping to capture some of the magic of the desert.
It is magical. The intense colours of the red earth, green trees and endless
blue skies take the breath away before fading to delicate purples and then
inky black as the day ends. The immense emptiness overwhelms, even in the
company of a full coachload.
But to share the sunrise with five other coachloads is depressing. The
astonishing sight of the dark rock flaming orange and then red as the sun
appears over the horizon is dulled by flash-guns.
There is an uncomfortable sense of being herded through the experience as
coaches draw up to the parking lot, leaving their engines running to
maintain the air-conditioning. Even in low season - the heat of <DATE>December</DATE> -
the sheer volume of coachloads of predominantly Japanese tourists deadens
the effect. I dread to think what it is like in the cooler Australian winter
months.
I wanted to be about 10kms further back, too, as the parking area is at the
base of the <ORGANIZATION>Rock</ORGANIZATION>, making it impossible to appreciate the isolation and
beauty of the monolith.
I took my best photographs from 20kms away, on the road out to the Olgas, or
<PERSON>Kata Tjuta</PERSON>, as the Aboriginals call this formation of red, softly-rounded
domes that rear up out of the desert 32km west of <LOCATION>Uluru</LOCATION>. Even on a coach it
is possible to capture a sense of the emptiness and intense heat of the
Outback as many visitors, on a two-day package, miss out the Olgas
altogether. That is their loss, but a bonus for those who go.
The Olgas are so completely unexpected that they cannot fail to impress.
Ayers Rock, by contrast, is exactly what you do expect - large and red.
There is a sense of mystery about the Olgas with their winding trails,
undulating humps and startling colours. My group watched the sun go down in
silence, awed by the flamboyant light show played out on the domes.
The 6km walk through the <ORGANIZATION>Valley of the Winds</ORGANIZATION> is far more rewarding than the
haul up <LOCATION>Uluru</LOCATION>, and you sidestep the heavy-breathing queue determined to
conquer the Rock. Starting from the car park, the <ORGANIZATION>Valley of the Winds</ORGANIZATION> trail
winds through a spectacular gorge punctuated by unexpectedly green trees and
vegetation before culminating in a scramble up to the lookout, from where
the rest of the range stretches out to meet the desert.
The evening light is mellow and gold, and takes the startling desert colours
to their most intense before fading delicately. Then all the stars come out.
The skies over central <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> are some of the darkest in the world and
make the northern hemisphere's pallid night sky, bleached by city lights,
sad by comparison.
In the desert you can see shooting stars flaring in the heavens while
satellites appear as falling points of light and the Milky Way winds
overhead like a giant ribbon.
Most people want to climb <PERSON>Ayers Rock</PERSON>, but it is sobering to see the plaques
at the bottom commemorating some of the climbers who have lost their lives.
The practice of placing plaques on the Rock was stopped some time ago, but
the death toll continues to rise.
The only surprise is that the toll is not higher, given the motley crew of
fat and ill-prepared tourists that starts the climb. A sign at the bottom
points out that it is not for the unfit, and that the local aboriginal tribe
would rather you did not climb the Rock, but it is blithely disregarded by
the hordes determined to sign the visitors' book at the top.
In the ultimate sanitisation of the Rock, the Japanese parties are issued
with white gloves to protect their hands from the chain with which you haul
yourself up the steepest part of the climb. It is a real climb, not a steep
walk. There are parts where you dare not stand up straight, while the gentle
breeze that took the edge off the
the bottom swiftly becomes a gale, threatening your balance as well as hats
and lens-caps.
No doubt the view from the top is tremendous - I decided that I was not
there to kill myself and came back down - but you can see it from a light
aircraft. There are several operators who will fly you around both the Rock
and the Olgas at sunset for a few dollars more.

<HL> LEISURE &amp; ARTS: Film: Unsettling Picture Puts Society on Trial </HL>

<TEXT>
   For her latest movie, "A Cry in the Dark," <PERSON>Meryl Streep</PERSON>'s head has been helmeted into a dark <PERSON>Buster Brown</PERSON> hairdo. 
This blunt cut gives her the wary look of a punt returner facing the unfriendly heavyweights waiting to tackle. 

   At first it's off-putting; you think, there she goes again, acting with her hair. 
But as this unsettling picture progresses, you realize that the look is deliberately off-putting. 
You are supposed to see <PERSON>Ms. Streep</PERSON>'s character, <PERSON>Lindy Chamberlain</PERSON>, as the world saw her -- cold and remote, peering out from that protective headgear. 
And even more effectively than usual, <PERSON>Ms. Streep</PERSON> disappears into that cool character speaking with an impeccably rough-hewn Down Under accent. 

   The real <PERSON>Lindy Chamberlain</PERSON> became a tabloid queen in <DATE>1980</DATE>, when she took a vacation in the Australian outback with her husband, a minister, and their three children. 
One evening as the family prepared its campsite, their youngest child, a nine-week-old girl, disappeared. 
Though no one saw who took her, the family believed it was a dingo, the bushy-tailed Australian cousin of the American coyote. 
The story was played as a tragedy for a while. 
But the Chamberlains, who didn't have media advisers, watched their lives spin out of control. 
They became the objects of rumors and suspicions that <PERSON>Lindy</PERSON> had murdered their daughter and that her husband, <PERSON>Michael</PERSON>, had covered up for her. 

   The case became an Australian "cause celebre." 
Public opinion moved against the Chamberlains because they were Seventh-Day Adventists and because they seemed to enjoy the publicity they were getting -- and later because <PERSON>Lindy</PERSON>, with her stoniness and snarls, wasn't publicity-conscious enough. 
Despite the scant evidence and absence of motive, she was convicted of murder, at which point the journalistic community began to feel some sympathy for her. 
In <DATE>1985</DATE>, <PERSON>John Bryson</PERSON> wrote about the case in "Evil Angels," the book that became the foundation for the movie. 

   "Cry in the Dark" has a distracted quality, as though director <PERSON>Fred Schepisi</PERSON>, who was born and raised in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>, wants to keep his characters at a distance, the way they might seem on the <TIME>evening</TIME> news. 
He doesn't bow to the conventions of dramatic build, and for the most part gives little sense of time passing or what his characters are thinking or feeling. 
Yet the picture's power draws from this deliberate distancing; the movie isn't about <PERSON>Lindy Chamberlain</PERSON> so much as it is about the way the facts become obscured by imagery and by rumor, which feed a collective mythology. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Schepisi</PERSON>'s strategy -- he co-authored the script with <PERSON>Robert Caswell</PERSON> -- is to quickly dispense with the question of <PERSON>Lindy</PERSON>'s innocence. 
The opening sequence makes the film maker's position clear. 
Lindy may have made a mistake by failing to zip her baby into the tent, but she didn't -- as was later suggested -- cut the baby's head off and then, coolly, join her family for a campfire cookout. 
The film matter-of-factly lays out the horrible nighttime hunt for the child and the cruel, mundane details of the day after; for example, the district nurse supplies <PERSON>Lindy</PERSON>, who was still nursing the baby, with a breast pump and a diuretic to dry up her milk. 

   Thus, as the rest of the film unfolds, the audience is made to feel the way <PERSON>Michael Dukakis</PERSON>'s closest friends must have felt as they watched their man keep repeating his mistakes on camera as though he'd never taken a look at himself on videotape. 
The audience is put in the position of believing in <LOCATION>Lindy</LOCATION>, and watching her do everything exactly wrong, from a <LOCATION>P.R.</LOCATION> perspective. 
Her sound bites on the <TIME>evening</TIME> news show a woman wearing a mask. 
"You could crack walnuts on her face," someone mutters. (She does look a little witchy when a detractor spits at her in a phone booth and she starts laughing. 
It's probably a neurotic reaction but it looks bad. 
She even looks out-of-place in her own family: Her husband and kids are towheads while her mop is dark.) 
The film observes that people don't like to watch a mother speak about her murdered child dispassionately, though such behavior might be called stoicism in a man. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Schepisi</PERSON>'s body of work keeps returning to his fascination with myth and with the chaos that inevitably follows when civilization intrudes on nature. 
In "The Chant of <PERSON>Jimmie Blacksmith</PERSON>," he told the story of an aborigine half-caste who vents his frustration by murdering whites; "Iceman" was about a primitive exploited by scientists. 
The director has brought a supernatural sensibility to the Western genre ("Barbarosa") and to romantic comedy ("Roxanne"). 

   Here, he and his longtime collaborator, cinematographer <PERSON>Ian Baker</PERSON>, have visually split the film. 
The sequences shot in the outback are resonant and sweeping, full of portent. 
The film makers return again and again to <ORGANIZATION>Ayer's Rock</ORGANIZATION>, the sacred aboriginal site that has become <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s biggest tourist attraction. 
It was at this strange place -- the mountainous "rock" looks like a huge clump of red dirt that somebody tossed in the desert among the scrub brush -- that the <PERSON>Chamberlain</PERSON>'s baby, <LOCATION>Azaria</LOCATION>, disappeared. 
The camera zooms in on <ORGANIZATION>Ayer</ORGANIZATION>'s Rock with such speed it seems as though the rock is exerting a centripetal force. 
It's as though the film makers are saying: "Maybe we shouldn't tramp all over nature's preserve. 
Bad things will happen." 

   When the action turns to the humans, the colors wash out and the action slows down. 
The civilized world seems faded and remote -- as though the whole thing were being watched on TV monitors with bad reception. 

   Throughout the picture, <PERSON>Mr. Schepisi</PERSON> has set up a rotating chorus of kibitzers. 
He lays out the distortions and wild rumors by planting clumps of people in bars, at restaurants, at dockside, all of them talking about the <PERSON>Chamberlain</PERSON> case. 
The methodology is a little clunky; it's actually quite rare to see rooms of reporters sit goggle-eyed in front of TV sets and trade judgment calls, the way they do over and over again in this movie. 

   Still, it's a way to efficiently convey information to the audience. 
So we learn that people thought that <PERSON>Azaria</PERSON>, the child's name, meant "sacrifice in the wilderness" and believed that Seventh-Day Adventists were some weird cult that periodically killed babies. 
The gossip also reveals a strange nationalistic support of dingoes, as though the very act of accusing the indigenous wild dog of murder proved the Chamberlains were outcasts (women showed up at <LOCATION>Lindy</LOCATION>'s trial wearing T-shirts with the slogan, "The Dingo Is Innocent"). 

   The picture has the sensibility of a strong piece of journalism. 
You never quite get inside the characters; it's not they who are fascinating but the situation they're in. 
Yet there are glimpses into the Chamberlains at home that are powerfully telling. 
Lindy becomes pregnant again after <PERSON>Azaria</PERSON>'s death; she gets bigger and bigger as her trial approaches, and more tetchy. 
Her husband -- played sensitively by the Irish-born New Zealander <PERSON>Sam Neill</PERSON> -- finds himself overwhelmed by what's happened to them. 
He's a minister forced to question his faith in the most fundamental way. 
He's full of emotion; he picks at his head until it bleeds during the trial. 
Lindy, meanwhile, seems to be receding into her own flesh, occasionally emerging with a flash of anger. 

   This is a tough character to get hold of -- but <PERSON>Ms. Streep</PERSON> manages to do it. 
Though the accents, and certainly the coifs, ought to be old hat by now, this is a startling performance: You never see where it starts and where it ends.

<HEAD>Couple in Australia's Dingo Baby Case to Divorce</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SYDNEY, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> and <PERSON>Lindy Chamberlain</PERSON>, the
couple who claimed their infant daughter was spirited off by a
dingo in the Australian outback, are planning to divorce, a
newspaper said <DATE>Saturday</DATE>.
   The marriage fell victim to the strains of fighting for more
than nine years to clear their names, the <ORGANIZATION>Sydney Morning Herald</ORGANIZATION>
said.
   The couple claimed in <DATE>August 1980</DATE> that their daughter <PERSON>Azaria</PERSON> was
carried away by a dingo, an Australian wild dog, from the tent
where they were camping in central <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> near Ayer's Rock.
   The child's body was never recovered. In <DATE>1981</DATE>, <PERSON>Lindy Chamberlain</PERSON>
was charged and later convicted of her daughter's murder. She spent
3{ years in prison but was released after new evidence was
discovered - a piece of clothing that indicated a dingo might
indeed have taken the child.
   The infant's disappearance, one of the most hotly disputed
criminal cases in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s history, was the subject of a
Hollywood movie ``A Cry in the Dark,'' starring Meryl Streep as
<PERSON>Lindy Chamberlain</PERSON>.
   The newspaper said the couple is still living together at their
home north of <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION> and that it has not been decided who will have
custody of their three remaining children.
   <PERSON>Lindy Chamberlain</PERSON> is in <LOCATION>New Zealand</LOCATION> on a nine-day trip to
promote her book, ``Through My Eyes.''

   <ORGANIZATION>N.W. Ayer Inc.</ORGANIZATION> said its European network of ad agencies won an assignment for <ORGANIZATION>Gillette Co.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>. 
The annual budget for the assignment is estimated at <MONEY>$25 million</MONEY>. 

   The assignment was held by the <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> office of <ORGANIZATION>Chicago-based Foote, Cone &amp; Belding Communications Inc</ORGANIZATION>. 

   Ayer has worked for <ORGANIZATION>Gillette</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> since <DATE>1986</DATE> and in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> since <DATE>1979</DATE>. 
The new assignment includes advertising for <ORGANIZATION>Gillette</ORGANIZATION> personal division brands, including Aapri facial scrub, Silkience shampoo and conditioner and a variety of new products. 
Ayer already creates the domestic ads for many of those same products. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Foote Cone</ORGANIZATION> competed with Ayer for the account. 
That account was put under review last year, when Boston-based <ORGANIZATION>Gillette</ORGANIZATION> reorganized its businesses. 
Since last month, <ORGANIZATION>Gillette</ORGANIZATION> has been operating its European operations under the same umbrella as its <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and Canadian businesses. 

   A <ORGANIZATION>Gillette</ORGANIZATION> spokesman said that giving the account to <ORGANIZATION>Ayer</ORGANIZATION> made sense. 
"<PERSON>Foote Cone</PERSON> has no (<ORGANIZATION>Gillette</ORGANIZATION>) business here" in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> he said. 
"Ayer has the bulk of that business here, so for consistency, it made sense to give them" the European account. 

   For <ORGANIZATION>Ayer</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Gillette</ORGANIZATION> assignment is the largest the agency has in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>. 
An Ayer spokeswoman said it is also the agency's "biggest international account gain since" winning the advertising account for <ORGANIZATION>Pan Am Corp.</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1978</DATE>. 
Ayer no longer works for the airline holding company, having lost the account in <DATE>1981</DATE> to <LOCATION>New York-based Wells</LOCATION>, Rich, <ORGANIZATION>Greene Inc</ORGANIZATION>.

   The <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Army</ORGANIZATION>, breaking off a 19-year-old relationship with its advertising agency, <ORGANIZATION>N.W. Ayer Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, awarded a <MONEY>$100 million</MONEY> advertising contract to <ORGANIZATION>Young &amp; Rubicam Inc</ORGANIZATION>. 

   Ayer said it will take "appropriate legal action" against the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> "to recover from the damage unjustly inflicted on this company and its reputation." 

   The <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> had decided in <DATE>October</DATE> that it wouldn't extend Ayer's contract, and opened its advertising to competitve bidding. 
In <DATE>November</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Ayer</ORGANIZATION> was suspended from bidding on <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> government contracts because of alleged improprieties by a former employee. 
It took a number of legal steps to try to overturn the government suspension so that it could compete for the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> advertising contract; those steps, however, were unsuccessful. 

   In an interview <TIME>last night</TIME>, <PERSON>Louis T. Hagopian</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Ayer</ORGANIZATION>'s chairman, said, "We're going to sue for all of the money we spent in the resolicitation that we were encouraged to take part in as if we had an equal chance." 
He said the company currently is calculating how much it spent in the preparation of the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> bid, but that the figure could be as much as the low <MONEY>millions of dollars</MONEY>. 

   In a bitter memo to employees, <PERSON>Mr. Hagopian</PERSON> added: "We are convinced that we won the resolicitation competition. 
Someday, we will know for sure, when the Freedom of Information Act allows us to get into that." 
He elaborated in the interview that he believes the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> had decided to choose Ayer, but changed its mind after <ORGANIZATION>Ayer</ORGANIZATION> was suspended from government bidding. 

   An <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> spokesman said: "<PERSON>N.W. 
Ayer</PERSON> was considered up until the time they were suspended. 
We aren't getting into if they would have won." 

   Closely held Ayer created the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION>'s highly successful "Be All You Can Be" campaign, and the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> was among its largest and most prestigious accounts. 

   The <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> spokesman said the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> chose closely held <ORGANIZATION>Young &amp; Rubicam</ORGANIZATION> over five competitors, not including Ayer. 
He said <ORGANIZATION>Young &amp; Rubicam</ORGANIZATION>'s contract would call for <MONEY>$100 million</MONEY> of print and broadcast advertising in <DATE>1987</DATE>, with annual renewable options for <DATE>1988</DATE> through <DATE>1991</DATE>, giving the lucrative contract a value of as much as <MONEY>$500 million</MONEY>. 
The contract includes advertising for the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Army</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> reserve, and the <ORGANIZATION>Army Reserve Officers Training Corp</ORGANIZATION>, or ROTC. 

   <PERSON>Alex Kroll</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Young &amp; Rubicam</ORGANIZATION>'s chairman and chief executive officer, called the award "a singularly important achievement," and noted that "the competition for this account was intense and challenging." 
<ORGANIZATION>Young &amp; Rubicam</ORGANIZATION> long has hoped to win the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> account. 

   The <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> said the other ad agencies in the running included the New York-based agencies <PERSON>Batten</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Barton</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Durstine &amp; Osborn Inc.</ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION>DFS Dorland Worldwide Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION>Saatchi &amp; Saatchi PLC</ORGANIZATION> unit; and SSC&amp;B:<ORGANIZATION>Lintas Worldwide</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>Interpublic Group of Cos</ORGANIZATION>. 
Other bidders were <ORGANIZATION>Ogilvy &amp; Mather</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>New York-based Ogilvy Group Inc.</ORGANIZATION>; and <PERSON>Woodbridge</PERSON>, Va.-based <ORGANIZATION>Wilmar Group Ltd</ORGANIZATION>. 

   New York-based <ORGANIZATION>Ayer</ORGANIZATION>'s suspension from bidding was based on <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> charges that Ayer falsified time cards from <DATE>1979</DATE> to <DATE>1983</DATE> and submitted noncompetitive bids through a scheme with subcontractors. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> also said that a former <ORGANIZATION>Ayer</ORGANIZATION> vice president pleaded guilty to accepting kickbacks. 

   In his memo yesterday, <PERSON>Mr. Hagopian</PERSON> said: "We have been treated shabbily through a <DATE>three-and-one-half year</DATE> investigation that has produced no formal charge or indictment against us as a company."

   Federal officials ended their investigation into <ORGANIZATION>N.W. Ayer Inc.</ORGANIZATION>'s handling of the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Army</ORGANIZATION> recruiting campaign, the ad agency said.

   The investigation, which began in <DATE>July 1983</DATE>, resulted in a former Ayer employee's guilty plea in <DATE>1986</DATE> to a charge of accepting kickbacks from a supplier of recruiting films. 

   Last <DATE>November</DATE> the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> broke off a 19-year-old relationship with <ORGANIZATION>Ayer</ORGANIZATION>, "largely because of this investigation and the innuendoes it generated," <PERSON>Mr. Hagopian</PERSON> said. 

   "The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> attorney's decision leaves us with a profound sense of relief that our confidence in the honor and integrity of <ORGANIZATION>Ayer</ORGANIZATION> is vindicated at last," he added. 
"We're not angry any more." 

   Ayer had been responsible for the "Be all you can be" ad campaign for the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION>. 
The <MONEY>$100 million</MONEY> account was awarded to <ORGANIZATION>Young &amp; Rubicam Inc.</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>January</DATE>.

<HL> NW Ayer to Buy

   The advertising agency <ORGANIZATION>NW Ayer Inc.</ORGANIZATION> agreed to buy most of <ORGANIZATION>C&amp;W Group Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, an agency that accounts for about <PERCENT>30%</PERCENT> of the revenue of <ORGANIZATION>C&amp;W</ORGANIZATION>'s parent holding company, <ORGANIZATION>Mickelberry Corp</ORGANIZATION>. 

   Ayer said it agreed, as expected, to purchase <ORGANIZATION>C&amp;W</ORGANIZATION>, which is the parent of <ORGANIZATION>Cunningham &amp; Walsh Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and two other ad agencies, except for the group's <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> office. 

   <ORGANIZATION>C&amp;W</ORGANIZATION>'s clients include <ORGANIZATION>American Home Products Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Procter &amp; Gamble Co</ORGANIZATION>. Ayer's clients include <ORGANIZATION>American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Avon Products Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Gillette Co</ORGANIZATION>. 

   A price wasn't disclosed, but industry sources said it was between <MONEY>$25 million</MONEY> and <MONEY>$30 million</MONEY>. 

   The merged agency's combined billings would have placed it as the nation's 15th-largest agency in <DATE>1985</DATE>. 

   Ad agencies in the past have typically received as commissions <PERCENT>15%</PERCENT> of an advertiser's billings, the total cost of placing ads. 
The purchased units had <DATE>1985</DATE> billings of <MONEY>$275 million</MONEY>. 
Ayer had <DATE>1985</DATE> billings of <MONEY>$826.4 million</MONEY>. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Mickelberry</ORGANIZATION>, a holding company for advertising and marketing concerns, decided to sell <ORGANIZATION>C&amp;W</ORGANIZATION> because "we got a very good offer," said <PERSON>John Morton</PERSON>, assistant treasurer. 
He added that <ORGANIZATION>Mickelberry</ORGANIZATION> will probably reinvest the proceeds of the sale in other marketing acquisitions. 
"We will undoubtedly continue to specialize in market service specialty companies, and that may or may not include advertising agencies," he said. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Mickelberry</ORGANIZATION> in the past hasn't been a strong performer: While revenue increased every year from <DATE>1983</DATE> to <DATE>1985</DATE>, net income dropped steadily, and the company had a <MONEY>$1.8 million</MONEY> loss last year. 
<PERSON>Mr. Morton</PERSON> said that <ORGANIZATION>C&amp;W</ORGANIZATION> has been a "prime" cause of that lackluster performance. 
He added that <ORGANIZATION>Mickelberry</ORGANIZATION>'s remaining units "are healthy, profitable, and growing." 

   The <ORGANIZATION>C&amp;W</ORGANIZATION> units <ORGANIZATION>Mickelberry</ORGANIZATION> agreed to sell account for about <PERCENT>30%</PERCENT> of its revenue, according to <PERSON>Mr. Morton</PERSON>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Mickelberry</ORGANIZATION> is keeping the <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> office "to maintain a presence in the <LOCATION>Midwest</LOCATION>" and because of a client conflict with Ayer. 

   Ayer has relatively few accounts in the consumer packaged goods area, while <ORGANIZATION>P&amp;G</ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION>C&amp;W</ORGANIZATION> client, is one of the most prestigious clients in that field. 
Moreover, <ORGANIZATION>C&amp;W</ORGANIZATION>'s strong <LOCATION>West Coast</LOCATION> operations will allow <ORGANIZATION>Ayer</ORGANIZATION> to double its size there while becoming more involved in the region's high-technology businesses, <ORGANIZATION>Ayer</ORGANIZATION> said. 

   The acquisition, which is expected to close in the next few weeks, comes at a good time for <ORGANIZATION>Ayer</ORGANIZATION>. 
It currently faces the possibility of losing the lucrative <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Army</ORGANIZATION> account, for which it created the "Be All You Can Be" campaign. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> has put its account up for bid on the heels of charges of impropriety by an <ORGANIZATION>Ayer</ORGANIZATION> executive dealing with the account. 
The service will choose an agency in <DATE>January</DATE>. 

   Ayer said its "eventual goal" is to combine the two advertising companies under the Ayer name. 
<PERSON>Louis T. Hagopian</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Ayer</ORGANIZATION>'s chairman, added that "if there are going to be consolidations of jobs, they are down the way, and we expect that economies of scale will come through attrition rather than layoffs." 
The combined agencies have 3,030 employees. 

   Three senior officers of <ORGANIZATION>Cunningham &amp; Walsh</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, are expected to become directors of <ORGANIZATION>Ayer</ORGANIZATION>, which is closely held.

   <ORGANIZATION>NW Ayer Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, an advertising agency, will likely agree to buy another agency, <ORGANIZATION>C&amp;W Group Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, within the week, according to sources close to the negotiations. 

   The sources said that, barring unforeseen difficulties, an announcement will be made by the end of this week or early next week. 
Although it isn't clear how much closely held Ayer would pay, industry sources value <ORGANIZATION>C&amp;W</ORGANIZATION> in the <MONEY>$30 million</MONEY> range. 

   <ORGANIZATION>C&amp;W</ORGANIZATION>, parent of <ORGANIZATION>Cunningham &amp; Walsh Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, creates advertising for clients such as <ORGANIZATION>American Home Products Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Procter &amp; Gamble Co</ORGANIZATION>. Ayer clients include <ORGANIZATION>American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Avon Products Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Gillette Co</ORGANIZATION>. 

   <ORGANIZATION>C&amp;W</ORGANIZATION> is the largest unit of <ORGANIZATION>Mickelberry Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, an advertising agency holding company. 
<ORGANIZATION>Mickelberry</ORGANIZATION> historically hasn't been a star advertising performer; while its revenue increased every year from <DATE>1983</DATE> to <DATE>1985</DATE>, net income dropped steadily, and the company posted a <MONEY>$1.8 million</MONEY> loss last year. 
"You can't turn (a company) around on short notice," said <PERSON>Alan Gottesman</PERSON>, an analyst with <PERSON>L.F. Rothschild</PERSON>, <PERSON>Unterberg</PERSON>, <PERSON>Towbin</PERSON>. 
"But they've had the time. 
If they were going to do something, they would have done it by now." 

   <ORGANIZATION>Mickelberry</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Ayer</ORGANIZATION> officials declined to comment on the reports of the impending purchase. 

   Analysts and industry executives speculated that if <ORGANIZATION>Mickelberry</ORGANIZATION> sells <ORGANIZATION>C&amp;W</ORGANIZATION> it might use the proceeds to diversify into other businesses or liquidate itself. 
Without <ORGANIZATION>C&amp;W</ORGANIZATION>, it would only have a few relatively small advertising and marketing units. 
<ORGANIZATION>Mickelberry</ORGANIZATION>, which was founded in <DATE>1893</DATE>, was a food-processing company before branching into communications more than a decade ago. 

   For <ORGANIZATION>Ayer</ORGANIZATION>, a purchase of <ORGANIZATION>C&amp;W</ORGANIZATION> couldn't come at a better time. 
Ayer is currently facing the possibility of losing the lucrative <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Army</ORGANIZATION> account, for which it created the "Be all you can be" campaign. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> has put its account up for bid on the heels of charges of impropriety by an <ORGANIZATION>Ayer</ORGANIZATION> executive dealing with the account. 
It will choose an ad agency next month. 
If Ayer doesn't win the account, it would lose revenue while its overhead costs would remain the same, said <PERSON>Mr. Gottesman</PERSON>. 
It might need an acquisition "to fill that void." 

   C&amp;W billed <MONEY>$399.9 million</MONEY> in <DATE>1985</DATE> and was the 24th-largest ad agency. 
Ayer, with billings of <MONEY>$826.4 million</MONEY>, was ranked as the 18th-largest agency by Advertising Age, a trade publication.

<HL> Burger King Shifts $200 Million Account
To N.W. Ayer From J. Walter Thompson

   <ORGANIZATION>Burger King Corp.</ORGANIZATION> ended a five-month advertising agency review by awarding its <MONEY>$200 million</MONEY> domestic account to <ORGANIZATION>N.W. Ayer Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, snubbing incumbent <ORGANIZATION>J. Walter Thompson Co</ORGANIZATION>. 

   The account move is believed to be the largest such switch in history. 
It deals a powerful blow to <PERSON>Thompson</PERSON>, <PERSON>Burger King</PERSON>'s ad agency for 11 years. 
Miami-based <ORGANIZATION>Burger King</ORGANIZATION> had been <PERSON>Thompson</PERSON>'s second-largest account, after <ORGANIZATION>Ford Motor Co.</ORGANIZATION>, and contributed <MONEY>$15 million</MONEY> to <MONEY>$20 million</MONEY> a year in revenue, industry executives said. 

   "We're very disappointed. 
It's a big emotional loss and a large revenue loss," said <PERSON>Stephen G. Bowen Jr.</PERSON>, president of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> operations for <PERSON>Thompson</PERSON>, a unit of London-based <ORGANIZATION>WPP Group PLC</ORGANIZATION>. 
"But we've known, even though we refused to quit," <PERSON>Mr. Bowen</PERSON> said, adding that "we've done our <DATE>1988</DATE> planning with the assumption that we wouldn't retain it." 
He said there will be layoffs, but declined to speculate on how many. 
More than 100 people worked on the Burger King account, with varying degrees of involvement. 

   Officials of <ORGANIZATION>Burger King</ORGANIZATION> and closely held <ORGANIZATION>Ayer</ORGANIZATION> didn't unveil a new ad campaign, and <PERSON>Charles S. Olcott</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Burger King U.S.A.</ORGANIZATION>, said Ayer commercials wouldn't appear until early <DATE>1988</DATE>. 
But the new campaign likely will take a different tack from the current "The Best Food for Fast Times" campaign, which has been criticized in the industry as inconsistent and unfocused. 

   <PERSON>Burger King</PERSON>, a unit of Minneapolis-based <ORGANIZATION>Pillsbury Co.</ORGANIZATION>, could use a boost from advertising. 
Average unit sales were slightly above <MONEY>$1 million</MONEY> for the 12 months ended <DATE>May 31</DATE>, about flat with the previous year, <PERSON>Mr. Olcott</PERSON> said. 

   "What you're going to see is a consistent brand identity and less switching around," <PERSON>Mr. Olcott</PERSON> said in an interview after a press conference at a Burger King here. 
He said the new ads would emphasize the personal contact customers get at <ORGANIZATION>Burger King restaurants</ORGANIZATION>, as well as three selling points: "flame-broiling, 'Have it your way,' and quality food." 
He also said that <ORGANIZATION>Burger King</ORGANIZATION> and Ayer would step up local and regional marketing efforts. 

   The account switch is a setback for <ORGANIZATION>WPP Group</ORGANIZATION>, which purchased <PERSON>Thompson</PERSON> and its parent, <ORGANIZATION>JWT Group Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, during the <DATE>summer</DATE>. 
<ORGANIZATION>JWT</ORGANIZATION> had been saddled with management turmoil and high turnover during the past year. 
After buying <ORGANIZATION>JWT</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>WPP Group</ORGANIZATION> was lauded for bringing back several highly respected former <ORGANIZATION>JWT</ORGANIZATION> officers, including <PERSON>Burton J. Manning</PERSON>, now <PERSON>Thompson</PERSON>'s chairman and chief executive officer. 
Burger King is the first major client loss since <ORGANIZATION>WPP Group</ORGANIZATION> took over. 

   Although the account loss will hurt the ad agency, analysts said they aren't lowering earnings estimates for <ORGANIZATION>WPP Group</ORGANIZATION>. 
"There's probably going to be some minor setback to the earnings turnaround (at <LOCATION>Thompson</LOCATION>), but I don't know if it will be demonstrable," said <PERSON>Greg Ostroff</PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION>Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co</ORGANIZATION>. 

   <PERSON>Alan Gottesman</PERSON>, an analyst with <PERSON>L.F. Rothschild</PERSON>, <PERSON>Unterberg</PERSON>, <PERSON>Towbin</PERSON>, added that the Burger King account apparently wasn't highly profitable for <PERSON>Thompson</PERSON>, in part because it was on a fee basis that generated less revenue than the traditional <PERCENT>15%</PERCENT> commission would have produced. 
Ayer will also operate on a fee rather than on a commission basis. 

   For <ORGANIZATION>Ayer</ORGANIZATION>, which was the nation's 15th-largest ad agency in <DATE>1986</DATE> according to Advertising Age, the account helps make up for a recent setback. 
In <DATE>January</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Ayer</ORGANIZATION> lost the <MONEY>$100 million</MONEY> <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Army</ORGANIZATION> account after <DATE>19 years</DATE> of creating its advertising, including the slogan "Be All You Can Be." 

   Ayer was one of three finalists in the competition, along with <PERSON>Thompson</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>D'Arcy Masius Benton &amp; Bowles Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a closely held agency here. 
At <ORGANIZATION>Ayer</ORGANIZATION>, some 50 to 70 employees have worked since early <DATE>summer</DATE> preparing the pitch, culminating last week in a polished presentation to Burger King that included finished commercials. 
"Last week," said <PERSON>Jerry J. Siano</PERSON>, <PERSON>Ayer</PERSON>'s vice chairman, "was a constant all-nighter." 

   Ayer's competitors estimated that the agency spent in excess of <MONEY>$1 million</MONEY> to prepare its pitch. 
<PERSON>Mr. Siano</PERSON> declined to comment on the amount.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   <ORGANIZATION>Continental Airlines</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>Friday</DATE> it had
dismissed <ORGANIZATION>N.W. Ayer</ORGANIZATION> as its advertising agency, ending an
association that began in <DATE>1986</DATE>.
   The Houston-based carrier, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, notified
the agency late <DATE>Thursday</DATE> that it was placing its advertising
assignment up for review, the agency said.
   ``Ayer is no longer <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>'s agency as of today,''
<ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> spokesman Art Kent confirmed by telephone from <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION>.
``We just felt it was time for a change.''
   He said he could not elaborate and did not know what steps were
being taken to get another agency.
   Ayer had been using the theme ``Working to be your choice'' in
<ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>'s advertising. Recent ads touting service to
warm-weather destinations used the line, ``We've got your place in
the sun.''
   <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> planned to spend an estimated <MONEY>$35 million</MONEY> to <MONEY>$40
million</MONEY> on its advertising this year, executives familiar with the
account said. Kent said he did not know the actual figure.
   Ayer, a privately-held agency based in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, handles <MONEY>$1.3
billion</MONEY> in advertising billings worldwide and counts among its
clients <ORGANIZATION>American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Procter &amp; Gamble Co.</ORGANIZATION>
and <ORGANIZATION>General Motors Corp</ORGANIZATION>.
   The decision came as a surprise to <ORGANIZATION>Ayer</ORGANIZATION> executives, said Vice
Chairman <PERSON>Thomas F. Maxey</PERSON>. ``We had no indication this was coming,''
he said.
   Ayer opened an office in <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION> after it was awarded the
account in <DATE>1986</DATE>, and the office currently employs about 30 people.
Ten to 15 more employees work on the <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> account in <LOCATION>New
York</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Maxey</PERSON> said it was likely that the <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION> office would be closed
after an orderly transition. Ayer expects to continue servicing the
account for up to 90 days. In addition to the <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> account,
the <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION> office handles only a few small public service
assignments at no charge.
   <PERSON>John Walsh</PERSON>, an executive vice president who oversees the
<ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> account, said he understood that <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>'s business
was improving although the industry has been troubled by declining
traffic and rising fuel costs.
   ``They said they felt they needed a change. In our estimation of
the situation, the situation was good and our work was good,'' he
said.
   Kent confirmed <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>'s business was improving. He said the
airline earned <MONEY>$59.1 million</MONEY> for the <DATE>first nine months of 1989</DATE>, in
contrast to a loss of <MONEY>$215.9 million</MONEY> a year earlier.
   <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION> also owns <ORGANIZATION>Eastern Airlines</ORGANIZATION>, which has been operating
since <DATE>March</DATE> under protection of federal bankruptcy laws and has
been losing millions of dollars.
   Airline accounts are particularly labor-intensive, industry
executives say, because of frequent price changes within the
industry and the need to develop different print ads for each
market.
   But <PERSON>Maxey</PERSON> said Ayer would be interested in going after another
airline account anyway. He said the agency handles advertising
assignments for <ORGANIZATION>Iberia Airlines</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Air France</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Scandanavian
Airline System</ORGANIZATION>.
   He said the agency is one of the finalists for four different
advertising assignments, which he declined to identify.
   In <DATE>1989</DATE>, Ayer was fired by <ORGANIZATION>Burger King Corp.</ORGANIZATION> after working as
its ad agency for 18 months and producing the campaign, ``We do it
like you'd do it.'' The fast-food chain was spending <MONEY>$150 million</MONEY> a
year on its advertising then.
   Among Ayer's recent notable ads have been its commercials for
<ORGANIZATION>AT&amp;T</ORGANIZATION> long-distance service that featured people near the <LOCATION>Berlin</LOCATION>
Wall and a commercial for <ORGANIZATION>Phillip's Milk of Magnesia</ORGANIZATION> that used a
roll of toilet paper to illustrate the powers of the laxative.

a new agency to handle its national advertising after just 18
months with <ORGANIZATION>N.W. Ayer Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, the firm that created the slogan, ``We
Do It Like You'd Do It.''
   The Miami-based fast-food restaurant operator said it had
already selected three agencies to compete for the assignment and
expected to decide by <DATE>summer</DATE>.
   The decision was not entirely unexpected because the nation's
second largest fast-food chain has undergone extensive managerial
changes since its parent, <ORGANIZATION>Pillsbury Co.</ORGANIZATION>, was acquired earlier this
year by <ORGANIZATION>Grand Metropolitan PLC</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Great Britain</LOCATION>.
   Burger King's sales have been sluggish and it has been unable to
increase its share of the fast-food market, now estimated at about
<PERCENT>17 percent</PERCENT>.
   One of the three finalists is the <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> office of <PERSON>J. Walter
Thompson</PERSON>, whose <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> office was <PERSON>Burger King</PERSON>'s agency for 11
years until it was dumped in favor of <ORGANIZATION>Ayer</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>September 1987</DATE>.
   The other two finalists, <PERSON>Burger King</PERSON> said, are <ORGANIZATION>D'Arcy Masius
Benton &amp; Bowles</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION>Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Advertising</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>New
York</LOCATION>.
   D'Arcy formerly worked for the <ORGANIZATION>Hardee's Food Systems</ORGANIZATION> fast-food
chain and its <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> office currently is the agency for
<ORGANIZATION>Denny</ORGANIZATION>'s restaurants.
   Saatchi created the ``Where's the Beef'' advertising campaign
for <ORGANIZATION>Wendy's International Inc.</ORGANIZATION> in the mid-1980s.
   <PERSON>Barry Gibbons</PERSON>, <PERSON>Burger King</PERSON>'s chief executive, said he was
looking for a national agency ``with global capabilities, solid
industry experience, bold creative and media expertise and sound
strategic thinking _ and then have the determination to stick with
that agency.''
   He said the company had informally reviewed potential agencies
since <DATE>January</DATE>. The three finalists are expected to present
proposals to <ORGANIZATION>Burger King</ORGANIZATION> in three to four weeks after which a
decision will be announced.
   <PERSON>Gary Langstaff</PERSON>, <PERSON>Burger King</PERSON>'s new marketing chief, said the
search for a new national agency ``does not apply to our regional
agency structure,'' which apparently means <ORGANIZATION>Ayer</ORGANIZATION> will continue
producing local advertising.
   <PERSON>Joyce Meyers</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Burger King</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, said <PERSON>Burger King</PERSON>'s
marketing budget for <DATE>1989</DATE> is about <MONEY>$215 million</MONEY> including spending
on national and local advertising and promotions. She said no
decision has been made on how much of that figure will be spent on
national advertising alone this year.
   Officials at the <ORGANIZATION>New York-based Ayer</ORGANIZATION> said they handled about
<MONEY>$150 million</MONEY> in billings for Burger King last year, split fairly
evenly between national and local advertising.
   ``We are disappointed, surprised, but not unprepared,'' <PERSON>Louis T.
Hagopian</PERSON>, <PERSON>Ayer</PERSON>'s chairman and chief executive, said in a memo
distributed to employees.
   He noted that in the time Ayer held the account, <ORGANIZATION>Pillsbury</ORGANIZATION> had
four different chief executives while <ORGANIZATION>Burger King</ORGANIZATION> had four chief
executives and four heads of marketing.
   ``It is just a shame the agency has to take the rap for the
errors and inconsistencies of so many others who have come and gone
and come and gone,'' he wrote.
   <PERSON>Hagopian</PERSON> said that while there may be some layoffs, the agency
would do so ``as considerately as is humanly possible.'' About 100
Ayer people work on the account.
   He said the account represents about <PERCENT>10 percent</PERCENT> of the agency's
<MONEY>$1.5 billion</MONEY> in billings and that the agency's finances were strong.
   ``This is a blow, but it isn't even touching the foundations,''
he said.
   Ayer launched the ``We Do It Like You'd Do It'' campaign in
<DATE>February 1988</DATE>. The company has relied less heavily on the theme in
recent months, however, focusing on individual product promotion
instead.
   Burger <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s <PERSON>Myers</PERSON> said the decision to select a new national
agency was not as much a reflection on <ORGANIZATION>Ayers</ORGANIZATION>'s work as a desire by
the company's new management ``to start with clean sheet and signal
this is a new Burger King.''

   Burger King's new management moved <DATE>Thursday</DATE> to turn
around years of erratic advertising results by selecting two new
agencies to handle the major portion of its <MONEY>$215 million</MONEY>
advertising and marketing account.
   ``This is a non-traditional approach, but for us it is far more
important to be right, rather than conventional,'' said <PERSON>Barry J.
Gibbons</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Burger King Corp.</ORGANIZATION>'s chief executive.
   D'Arcy <ORGANIZATION>Masius Benton &amp; Bowles of New York</ORGANIZATION> will concentrate on
reinforcing brand identity, while <ORGANIZATION>Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Advertising of
New York</ORGANIZATION> will concentrate on day-to-day brand retailing, <PERSON>Burger
King</PERSON> said.
   The agencies replace <ORGANIZATION>N.W. Ayer</ORGANIZATION>, the New York-based ad agency
hired 20 months ago that created the ``We do it like you'd do it''
theme Burger King began using in <DATE>January 1988</DATE>.
   The British-based conglomerate <ORGANIZATION>Grand Metropolitan PLC</ORGANIZATION> acquired
Burger King as part of its buyout of the <ORGANIZATION>Pillsbury Co.</ORGANIZATION>, based in
<LOCATION>Minneapolis</LOCATION>, in <DATE>January</DATE>. The Miami-based <PERSON>Burger King</PERSON> is a
subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION>Pillsbury</ORGANIZATION>.
   Burger King, which had systemwide sales of <MONEY>$5.4 billion</MONEY> in 5,800
restaurants during <DATE>fiscal year 1988</DATE>, has had little or no sales
growth over the past four years although it has held on to its
second-place position in the fast-food market behind industry
leader <ORGANIZATION>McDonald's Corp</ORGANIZATION>.
   Average sales per restaurant slipped <PERCENT>1 percent</PERCENT> <DATE>last year</DATE>, but
finished above <MONEY>$1 million</MONEY> for the fourth consecutive year, <PERSON>Burger
King</PERSON> said.
   The company estimates its market share has held fairly steady
over that period at about <PERCENT>17 percent</PERCENT>.
   <PERSON>Gary L. Langstaff</PERSON>, hired in <DATE>April</DATE> as <PERSON>Burger King</PERSON>'s executive
vice president of marketing after three years with <ORGANIZATION>Hardee</ORGANIZATION>'s, said
the dual-agency approach is part of an overall effort to improve
the focus of <ORGANIZATION>Burger King</ORGANIZATION> advertising.
   ``There are two keys for us _ day-to-day and long-term branding.
Our goal is to make both of those work in tandem,'' <PERSON>Langstaff</PERSON> said.
   He said no decision had been made yet on how ad spending would
be split between the two new agencies. He also declined to estimate
when advertising from the new agencies may start running.
   <PERSON>Langstaff</PERSON> said <PERSON>Burger King</PERSON> will continue to work on a
project-by-project basis with both its national promotion agencies,
<ORGANIZATION>Einson-Freeman Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, and <DATE>August</DATE>, Bishop and <PERSON>Meier</PERSON>. Burger King's
relationships are unchanged with other advertising agencies,
<ORGANIZATION>UniWorld Group Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Castor Spanish International</ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION>UniWorld</ORGANIZATION> and
Castor create ads for Burger King aimed at minority markets.
   Burger King disclosed last month that it planned to replace Ayer
on the national portion of its advertising business, but said Ayer
would continue to produce regional advertising.
   With <DATE>Thursday</DATE>'s announcement, <ORGANIZATION>Burger King</ORGANIZATION> indicated it would
sever all ties with Ayer after a brief transition period.
   Ayer was selected in <DATE>September 1987</DATE> as <ORGANIZATION>Burger King</ORGANIZATION>'s ad agency,
ending the fast-food company's 11-year association with <PERSON>J. Walter
Thompson</PERSON> of <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>.
   Thompson's work for <ORGANIZATION>Burger King</ORGANIZATION> included a roundly criticized
<DATE>1986</DATE> campaign that featured a search for the nerdy <PERSON>Herb</PERSON>, who had
never been to a <ORGANIZATION>Burger King</ORGANIZATION>.
   Subsequent campaigns from <PERSON>Thompson</PERSON> that used the themes ``This
is a Burger King Town'' and ``The Best Food for Fast Times'' failed
to spark sales.
   But <ORGANIZATION>Ayer</ORGANIZATION>'s ``We do it'' campaign also failed to boost sales.
Burger King also underwent a series of unsettling management
changes during Ayer's tenure.
   ``It has been said many times that timing is everything,'' <PERSON>Jerry
Siano</PERSON>, the head of <ORGANIZATION>Ayer</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>Thursday</DATE> in a memo to his employees.
``We were a year and a half early.''
   He said Grand Met has indicated ``a commitment to management
stability and marketing focus that will become the vital
ingredients to <PERSON>Burger King</PERSON>'s future success. We wish them much
success.''
   A jubilant <PERSON>Edward J. Wax</PERSON>, chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION>Saatchi &amp;
Saatchi</ORGANIZATION>, said he and other executives would travel soon to <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> to
begin defining roles and working up strategies.
   ``Obviously, we think they're a tremendous company,'' Wax said
from <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. ``There's a lot to be done, there's been a lot of
negative stuff written. It's a big challenge. But we're excited.''
   Wax called the two-agency approach fascinating and innovative
and said his earlier study of <ORGANIZATION>Burger King</ORGANIZATION> found strong management
commitment to improvement.
   His agency in the past has handled assignments for the fast food
operators <PERSON>Krystal</PERSON>, <PERSON>Wendy</PERSON>'s, and <ORGANIZATION>Arby</ORGANIZATION>'s, Wax said, and experienced
executives from those accounts will work on <ORGANIZATION>Burger King</ORGANIZATION>.

@  Ayer Set to Enter Joint Venture
@  For the Production of TV Shows

   N <ORGANIZATION>W Ayer Inc.</ORGANIZATION> expects to announce today a joint venture that will vault it into television production on a world-wide basis -- a venture that will create TV movies and miniseries, aired both here and abroad, sponsored by <ORGANIZATION>Ayer</ORGANIZATION> clients. 

   The venture is among the most ambitious efforts yet by an ad agency to tackle TV programming, an area advertisers dominated in the <DATE>1950s</DATE> and are returning to in increasing numbers now. 
It would allow Ayer's roster of big international clients -- including <ORGANIZATION>American Telephone &amp; Telegraph</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Gillette</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>General Motors</ORGANIZATION> -- to produce TV programs not just in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, but in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> and elsewhere. 
It also would give Ayer's European clients a chance to produce TV movies for their home turf. 

   The joint venture pairs Ayer with <ORGANIZATION>World International Network</ORGANIZATION>, known as WIN, an organization representing TV networks in 106 countries that has already co-produced a number of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> TV movies. 
WIN, formed in <DATE>1988</DATE>, has had a hand in TV movies including <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION>'s recent "In the Line of Duty: The <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> Murders"; <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION>'s "Day One," about the decision to drop the atomic bomb; and "The Final Days," chronicling the end of <PERSON>Richard Nixon</PERSON>'s presidency, which is to air <DATE>Oct. 22</DATE>. 

   The joint venture calls for Ayer clients to help finance and sponsor TV movies. 
At the same time, WIN's member stations, none of which are in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, would pay to air the movie in their countries. 
Most of the TV movies would also air in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> on network or cable stations. 
The arrangement would spread production costs around, while guaranteeing that the movie would air both here and abroad. 

   Advertisers disillusioned with the paltry fare on television have rediscovered TV production in the past few years; Ayer clients <ORGANIZATION>General Motors</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>AT&amp;T</ORGANIZATION>, which co-produced "Day One," are just two that have gotten involved in programming. 
But advertiser efforts so far have focused on the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> -- and the joint venture gives <ORGANIZATION>Ayer</ORGANIZATION>'s clients the ability to sponsor programs in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> and elsewhere, too. 

   "Even clients in European countries who couldn't otherwise have afforded programming now will have access to it. 
The bottom line is, it offers access to more programming for our clients," says <PERSON>Marcella Rosen</PERSON>, Ayer executive vice president and managing director for media services. 
Besides, she adds, the venture would allow Ayer clients to pick movies "that stand out . . . that aren't your standard bad tear-jerkers." 

   For WIN, the venture gives its member TV stations more programming, with the cost defrayed by the advertisers. 
Because of deregulation in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, TV stations are proliferating at breakneck speed. 
Europe "needs good product, and needs tons of programs," says <PERSON>Larry Gershman</PERSON>, WIN's chairman and chief executive officer. 

   According to <PERSON>Mr. Gershman</PERSON>, the venture expects in its first year to create about three movies sponsored by <ORGANIZATION>Ayer</ORGANIZATION> clients. 
It plans to grow quickly after that, with perhaps eight to nine productions the following year, he says. 

   The joint venture also gives <ORGANIZATION>Ayer</ORGANIZATION>'s clients a way to circumvent last week's edict by the <ORGANIZATION>European Community</ORGANIZATION> that the majority of European programming be produced in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>. 
Even for movies geared primarily to a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> audience, WIN/Ayer hopes to find some projects that can be filmed at least in part abroad, qualifying the movies as home-grown European programs. 
Other projects might focus primarily on <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, backed by some of <ORGANIZATION>Ayer</ORGANIZATION>'s Europe-based clients. 

   Ayer joins a number of other agencies that have gotten involved in TV programming, but it is among the front-runners in cracking the European market. 
Earlier this year, <ORGANIZATION>Interpublic Group of Cos.</ORGANIZATION> became <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>'s largest supplier of game shows by buying a <PERCENT>49%</PERCENT> stake in <ORGANIZATION>Fremantle International</ORGANIZATION>, a distributor of 43 game shows produced in nine European countries. 
And <PERSON>Foote</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Cone &amp; Belding</ORGANIZATION>'s FCB/Telecom has created programming for 11 years for <ORGANIZATION>Foote Cone</ORGANIZATION> clients. 
It says it plans to expand aggressively into <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> next year.

   Ayer is Considering Going Public
   As It Pays Heed to Financial Side

<LP>
   Ayer, one of the ad industry's oldest names and one of
just a handful of huge agencies to remain privately held, is
considering going public, its new chief financial officer
said.
   In an interview, Glenn Corlett said that financial
pressures on the beleaguered agency, which is still reeling
from two major client losses, are prompting him to explore a
number of alternatives, including going public.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   That admission is startling, considering that <ORGANIZATION>Ayer</ORGANIZATION> has
repeatedly stressed its determination to remain independent
and private. It also augurs a new direction for <ORGANIZATION>Ayer</ORGANIZATION>, which,
perhaps for the first time, is taking its finances as
seriously as it takes its ads.
   <PERSON>Mr. Corlett</PERSON> said the likelihood of such a drastic step is
probably less than <PERCENT>50%</PERCENT>, but that he nevertheless must give it
some consideration. "Taking this agency public is certainly
one thing we need to look at from time to time. We've
historically said we want to remain independent. . . . But
the fact of the matter is, in this changing world, you have
to re-evaluate that preference regularly. I'm looking at
that." He added that "the mandate I've been given is,
`nothing is out of bounds.'"
   <PERSON>Mr. Corlett</PERSON> said he would also consider other options,
such as selling a minority stake in <ORGANIZATION>Ayer</ORGANIZATION> to a foreign firm,
or a setup similar to the one between <ORGANIZATION>Foote, Cone &amp; Belding</ORGANIZATION>
and <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Publicis</ORGANIZATION>, in which each holds a minority stake
in the other. He said selling all or a majority of <ORGANIZATION>Ayer</ORGANIZATION> to
another company isn't under consideration. Any of those
alternatives would be a radical departure for <ORGANIZATION>Ayer</ORGANIZATION>, founded
121 years ago and known for its emotional ads for blue-chip
clients like <ORGANIZATION>American Telephone &amp; Telegraph</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>General Motors</ORGANIZATION>
and <ORGANIZATION>Procter &amp; Gamble</ORGANIZATION>.
   The fact that <PERSON>Mr. Corlett</PERSON> is even considering steps that
management had until recently ruled out categorically points
up just how distressed the advertising industry has become.
Ayer in particular has had a few rough years. Since <DATE>1988</DATE>,
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> billings have plunged <PERCENT>23%</PERCENT>, to an estimated <MONEY>$726 million</MONEY>
from <MONEY>$947 million</MONEY>, mostly because of the loss of two huge
accounts: Burger King in <DATE>1989</DATE> and <ORGANIZATION>Continental Airlines</ORGANIZATION>
earlier this year. The agency recently closed its <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION>
office and last year had to merge its <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> office with a
local agency there after the <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> outpost lost almost all
its clients.
   <PERSON>Mr. Corlett</PERSON>, who became chief financial officer last
month, spoke candidly in the interview about Ayer's financial
situation. In the past year, he said, revenue slid <PERCENT>25%</PERCENT>,
mostly because of the loss of the two clients. At the same
time, New York-based Ayer hasn't cut costs enough to counter
the revenue loss. <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> payroll costs, for example, have
declined only <PERCENT>17%</PERCENT> since <DATE>1988</DATE>, to an estimated <MONEY>$59 million</MONEY>
this year. The upshot: While the agency remains profitable,
its profitability fell last year and will remain about flat
this year, he said.
   Layoffs might seem a reasonable step to improve
profitability. But <ORGANIZATION>Ayer</ORGANIZATION>, which prides itself on its
paternalistic tradition of avoiding layoffs, is determined to
preserve that culture. Considering layoffs "was clearly
discouraged" by top management, <PERSON>Mr. Corlett</PERSON> said. He said he
is hoping to cut costs by attrition, doing away with some
duplicated functions and more fully computerizing the
company.
   Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION>Ayer</ORGANIZATION>, like other large privately held agencies,
must wrestle with how to expand and compete with agencies
that have access to funds from the public. The mega-agencies
that grew and merged throughout the <DATE>1980s</DATE> relied on raising
money through the public markets. Private agencies had to use
their own money and bank loans to keep up. Now, with ad
spending in a stubborn lull and with the economy awash in
uncertainty, the private agencies are finding expansion
difficult.
   Ayer, for one, used to make acquisitions with internally
generated cash. But in the past two years, it had to borrow
about <MONEY>$25 million</MONEY> to make several dozen European acquisitions
with a total price tag of over <MONEY>$50 million</MONEY>, <PERSON>Mr. Corlett</PERSON> said.
Part of his mandate is to find "economical ways to service
that debt," he said, while part is to find new ways to
continue growing.
   "You can raise money from the public markets if you're
public. But if you aren't, you've got a real problem with
financing that rapid growth," he said. "We are struggling
under the issues of how do we finance our growth and control
the related costs." He said one possible answer will be to
create joint ventures abroad, rather than to buy existing ad
agencies outright. The agency has 71 offices in 41 countries
and owns either the majority or <PERCENT>100%</PERCENT> of most of its agencies
abroad.
   Emphasizing that <ORGANIZATION>Ayer</ORGANIZATION> has ruled out selling all or a
majority of the agency to an outsider, <PERSON>Mr. Corlett</PERSON> said that
to remain independent, the agency "is willing to accept
tightening our belt and a little less profit."
   <PERSON>Mr. Corlett</PERSON>'s appointment is a sign that even the most
traditional Madison Avenue holdouts are taking finances more
seriously. A Price Waterhouse veteran, <PERSON>Mr. Corlett</PERSON> is the
first Ayer chief financial officer to come from the "outside"
and the first who didn't start his career in advertising. His
predecessor at <ORGANIZATION>Ayer</ORGANIZATION>, for instance, began as an account
executive.
   <PERSON>Mr. Corlett</PERSON> also is the first chief financial officer in
the agency's history to be named to the board. The fact that
his predecessors weren't "gives you a hint of what the
advertising people thought of that function -- they didn't
hold it in high regard," he said.
   "The financial function is coming out of the closet, and
it's becoming a lot more important in terms of whether the
agencies can remain competitive," he said. "Today, in order
to survive and compete, you'd better have effective financial
management. It probably hasn't been true before, but in the
<DATE>1990s</DATE>, it certainly is going to be true. You'll see a lot of
ad agencies go out of business because they don't pay
attention to the financial side."

   N <ORGANIZATION>W Ayer Inc.</ORGANIZATION> agreed to pay the government <MONEY>$750,000</MONEY> to settle overcharge claims involving advertising work for the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> stretching back to <DATE>1978</DATE>. 

   The settlement documents contend that the New York-based advertising company knowingly mischarged the government by using inaccurate time cards and record keeping for the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> ad campaign that popularized the slogan "Be All You Can Be." 
The documents also contend that Ayer failed to obtain competitive bids for subcontracts. 

   In <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, officials of N W Ayer weren't available to comment on the matter. 

   The company was suspended in <DATE>November 1986</DATE> from bidding on government contracts after <ORGANIZATION>Defense Department</ORGANIZATION> investigators asserted that N W Ayer overcharged the government. 

   Under terms of the settlement, the government agreed to lift the suspension. 
The company didn't admit any wrongdoing, but agreed to drop a civil suit against the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> seeking at least <MONEY>$525,000</MONEY> in damages, and to tighten internal accounting and time-keeping procedures.

   <ORGANIZATION>N.W. Ayer Inc.</ORGANIZATION> lost its bid for a temporary restraining order to prevent the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> from awarding its advertising contract to another company. 

   <ORGANIZATION>N.W. Ayer</ORGANIZATION>, a New York-based advertising agency, sought the order in federal <ORGANIZATION>District Court</ORGANIZATION> here after the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> last week decided, as previously reported, to uphold the company's suspension from bidding on <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> contracts. 

   Ayer, which was the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION>'s advertising agency for 19 years and created the successful "Be all that you can be" campaign, was suspended by the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> last <DATE>November</DATE> because of various allegations of irregularities in timekeeping and subcontracting. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION>'s <DATE>1987</DATE> contract is expected to be decided soon.

   <ORGANIZATION>General Motors Corp.</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Saturn Corp.</ORGANIZATION> subsidiary has narrowed to three the number of agencies it will consider for its advertising account, the largest up for grabs in the ad industry. 

   New York-based <ORGANIZATION>N W Ayer Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, Boston-based Hill, <PERSON>Holliday</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Connors, Cosmopulos Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>San Francisco-based Hal Riney &amp; Partners Inc.</ORGANIZATION> were told earlier this week that they had been selected as the finalists in the <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> competition, according to advertising industry executives. 

   Troy, Mich.-based <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> is expected to decide by the end of <DATE>May</DATE> which agency will handle the car account. 
<ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION>'s annual billings are expected to total about <MONEY>$100 million</MONEY>, making it one of the largest accounts by ad industry standards. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> officials declined to comment on the selection of ad agency finalists. 
Officials of <ORGANIZATION>N W Ayer</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Hill Holliday</PERSON>, and <PERSON>Riney</PERSON> all acknowledged they had been contacted by <DATE>Saturn this week</DATE>, but declined to elaborate. 

   Late last year, <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> had been contacted by some 50 agencies that expressed interest in getting the account. 
Saturn <DATE>earlier this year</DATE> narrowed its list to a handful of agencies, which also included <ORGANIZATION>D'Arcy Masius Benton &amp; Bowles Inc.</ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION>TBWA Advertising Inc.</ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON>Jordan</PERSON>, <PERSON>McGrath</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Case &amp; Taylor Inc.</ORGANIZATION>; and <ORGANIZATION>McCann-Erickson Worldwide &amp; Dailey &amp; Associates</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of the <ORGANIZATION>Interpublic Group of Cos</ORGANIZATION>. 

   There have been previous reports that N W Ayer and <PERSON>Hill Holliday</PERSON> were being considered for the <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> account, but that <PERSON>Hal Riney</PERSON> was also being considered came as a surprise to many in the industry, including several who were competing for the <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> account. 

   Riney grabbed headlines late last year when it resigned as the advertising agency for <LOCATION>Modesto</LOCATION>, Calif.-based <ORGANIZATION>E.&amp; J. Gallo Winery</ORGANIZATION>, after a brush with the Gallos. 
<PERSON>Riney</PERSON> was the creator of <ORGANIZATION>Gallo's Bartles &amp; Jaymes</ORGANIZATION> wine-cooler campaign. 
Other clients include <ORGANIZATION>Campbell Soup Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Good Housekeeping Magazine</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>California Prune Board</ORGANIZATION>. 

   But <PERSON>Riney</PERSON> also is the agency for <ORGANIZATION>Austin Rover Cars of North America</ORGANIZATION>'s Sterling cars. 
Austin Rover is the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> sales arm of <ORGANIZATION>Rover Group PLC</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>. 
Some ad executives said that could pose a potential conflict if <PERSON>Riney</PERSON> wins the <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> competition. 

   However, <PERSON>Riney</PERSON> president <PERSON>Jim Travis</PERSON> yesterday said, "There's no problem with Sterling." 
Officials of both <ORGANIZATION>Sterling</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> "don't consider it a conflict" because "They're in entirely different markets," he said. 

   Hill <PERSON>Holliday</PERSON>, however, would likely have to resign from one of its advertising accounts if it succeeds in getting <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> as a client. 
The agency represents <ORGANIZATION>Ford Motor Co.</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>New England</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> dealer groups. 
Hill <PERSON>Holliday</PERSON> also creates ads for <ORGANIZATION>Wang Laboratories</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>John Hancock Cos.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Revlon Group Inc</ORGANIZATION>. 

   N W Ayer's only automobile client is G.M., <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION>'s parent. 
The agency does corporate advertising for the auto maker.

   The <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> said that, after reviewing an appeal by <ORGANIZATION>N.W. Ayer Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, it has decided to uphold the advertising agency's suspension from bidding on government contracts. 

   Ayer, which was the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION>'s advertising agency for 19 years and created the successful "Be all that you can be" campaign, was suspended by the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> last <DATE>November</DATE> because of various allegations of improper timekeeping and subcontracting. 

   The continued suspension eliminates the company from competing for the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION>'s <DATE>1987</DATE> advertising contract, which is expected to be decided this week. 

   Ayer said that it plans to seek a temporary restraining order today to bar the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> from awarding the <DATE>1987</DATE> contract until the company can make a full appeal. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> said it plans to oppose any such attempt.

<HEAD>Fast-Food Giant Hires Two New York Ad Agencies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   <ORGANIZATION>Burger King Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, in an attempt to boost sluggish
sales and improve the focus of its advertising, has awarded most of
its <MONEY>$215 million</MONEY> account to two <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> agencies.
   ``The concept of a dual-agency partnership allows for
synergizing some of the best minds in the advertising business,''
said <PERSON>Gary Langstaff</PERSON>, <PERSON>Burger King</PERSON>'s executive vice president of
marketing.
   The fast-food giant's new management <DATE>Thursday</DATE> hailed the
unorthodox strategy, although some analysts speculated the two
agencies _ D'Arcy <ORGANIZATION>Masius Benton &amp; Bowles</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Saatchi &amp; Saatchi</ORGANIZATION> _
could end up grappling for control of the account.
   ``I'm skeptical as to whether two agencies can put <PERSON>Burger King</PERSON>'s
interest first over their own individual interests,'' said <PERSON>John
McMillin</PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION>Prudential-Bache Securities</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>.
   D'Arcy will focus on <PERSON>Burger King</PERSON>'s image, and <ORGANIZATION>Saatchi &amp; Saatchi</ORGANIZATION>
will concentrate on promotions and products, according to
restaurant executives.
   The agencies are expected to devise a marketing plan by <DATE>Jan. 1</DATE>,
<PERSON>Langstaff</PERSON> said. He said he won't know how the account will be
divided until they submit their plans.
   ``There's a lot to be done. There's been a lot of negative stuff
written,'' said <PERSON>Edward J. Wax</PERSON>, chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION>Saatchi &amp;
Saatchi</ORGANIZATION>, who called the two-agency approach fascinating. ``It's a
big challenge. But we're excited.''
   His agency in the past has handled <PERSON>Wendy</PERSON>'s and Arby's, Wax said,
and experienced executives from those accounts will work on <ORGANIZATION>Burger
King</ORGANIZATION>.
   Miami-based <PERSON>Burger King</PERSON>, taken over as part of Britain-based
conglomerate Grand Metropolitan's <DATE>January</DATE> acquisition of <ORGANIZATION>Pillsbury
Co.</ORGANIZATION>, will continue working with several other advertising and
promotional agencies on special projects.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Pillsbury</ORGANIZATION> subsidiary had sales of <MONEY>$5.4 billion</MONEY> from 5,800
restaurants during <DATE>fiscal 1988</DATE>.
   Burger King fired <ORGANIZATION>N.W. Ayer Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, which came up with the ``We do
it like you'd do it'' theme, as its national ad agency last month
after the campaign was criticized as ineffective. Ayer will stay on
through mid-August.
   Ayer was hired in <DATE>September 1987</DATE> as Burger King ended an 11-year
association with <PERSON>J. Walter Thompson</PERSON> of <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. Thompson created
the highly criticized campaign featuring a search for <ORGANIZATION>Herb</ORGANIZATION>, a nerd
who had never been to a <ORGANIZATION>Burger King</ORGANIZATION>.
   Subsequent campaigns from <PERSON>Thompson</PERSON> that used the themes ``This
is a Burger King Town'' and ``The Best Food for Fast Times'' failed
to make a significant impression with fast-food customers.
   Langstaff, hired in <DATE>April after three years</DATE> with <ORGANIZATION>Hardee</ORGANIZATION>'s, said
<PERSON>Burger King</PERSON> must carve out its own niche and develop its own image
to differentiate itself ``from the big boys,'' meaning <ORGANIZATION>McDonald's</ORGANIZATION>.

   J.C. Penney Switches Big Account
   To Bozell from Ayer in Dallas

   J.C. Penney Co. abruptly pulled its huge ad account from
Ayer's Dallas office, handing it to Bozell without so much as
the courtesy of a review.
   The Penney account, one of Ayer's largest and certainly
among its most visible, is a jolting loss that probably will
force the agency to close its Dallas office, which was
established in 1988 solely to serve Penney. Estimates of the
account's size differ, as they so often do, depending on
whether one asks the winner or the loser.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   According to <ORGANIZATION>Ayer</ORGANIZATION>, the account will bill <MONEY>$45.6 million</MONEY>
this year, down from <MONEY>$53 million</MONEY> a year ago. But <PERSON>Bozell</PERSON>
insiders insist the account bills closer to <MONEY>$75 million</MONEY>
annually. The actual number, say seasoned observers
accustomed to ad-biz hyperbole, probably falls in between.
   Penney said it yanked the account simply because <PERSON>Bozell</PERSON>'s
<LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> office, with 450 people vs. <PERSON>Ayer</PERSON>'s 45, is larger and
closer to <LOCATION>Penney</LOCATION> headquarters. The retailer moved to <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION>
from <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> in <DATE>1988</DATE>, and "we have slowly shifted suppliers.
. . . to <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> groups" since then, a spokesman said.
   But executives close to the retailer suggest <PERSON>Penney</PERSON> was
miffed by what it believed was Ayer's lack of attention. They
took the retailer for granted too much, said one executive
who requested anonymity. This executive said <PERSON>Ayer</PERSON>'s top
managers didn't go to <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> and were less responsive.
<PERSON>Bozell</PERSON>, like <ORGANIZATION>Ayer</ORGANIZATION>, is based in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, but its chairman,
<PERSON>Liener Temerlin</PERSON>, lives and works in <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> and will oversee
the Penney account.
   Penney's switch also may reflect business problems totally
unrelated to advertising. Like other retailers, it has been
hard hit by the recession. First-quarter net income plummeted
<PERCENT>48%</PERCENT>, to <MONEY>$80 million</MONEY>, on a <PERCENT>2.7%</PERCENT> sales decline. Penney has said
its results will continue to decline until the economy
strengthens.
   At the same time, the big mid-priced chain is struggling
with a major image problem. In its transition from
mass-merchant to fashionable department store, it has lost
hordes of traditional customers. But it hasn't replaced them
with wealthier consumers, who still look down their noses at
a company they view as decidedly declasse. Upscale brands,
including <PERSON>Liz Claiborne</PERSON>, refuse to sell to <LOCATION>Penney</LOCATION>, a huge
disability for <ORGANIZATION>Bozell</ORGANIZATION> as it attempts to polish the store's
image.
   The ad agency switch comes after years of wooing by
<ORGANIZATION>Bozell</ORGANIZATION>, which has been trying to get its foot in the door
ever since Penney arrived in <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION>. Speculation intensified
that Penney finally would switch to <ORGANIZATION>Bozell</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>March</DATE>, when
<PERSON>Bozell</PERSON> resigned the <MONEY>$25 million</MONEY> <ORGANIZATION>Zale Corp.</ORGANIZATION> jewelry store
chain account just two weeks after winning it. The agency at
the time cited a conflict with a tiny piece of Penney
business, for a shopping network that <ORGANIZATION>Penney</ORGANIZATION> has since
discontinued. Now, the Penney account becomes the
second-largest in <LOCATION>Bozell</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> office, after <ORGANIZATION>American
Airlines</ORGANIZATION>.
   "It's no secret that <PERSON>Bozell</PERSON> has been courting Penney ever
since they moved to <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> in <DATE>1988</DATE>," said <PERSON>Jerry Siano</PERSON>, Ayer's
chairman and chief executive officer. Yet while he heard
rumors about a possible switch for months, he said, the call
actually firing Ayer <TIME>last night</TIME> came as a surprise. Ayer had
heard "nothing but praise," from Penney executives, he said,
adding: "There was obviously no indication. It's
discouraging. It just isn't understandable. What else can I
say?"
   The loss is all the more discouraging because it came the
same day as news that another client, the sports daily The
<ORGANIZATION>National</ORGANIZATION>, was closing its doors. Ayer hasn't had many major
wins in recent years, and has lost several of its biggest
clients, including the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1987</DATE> and <ORGANIZATION>Burger King</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1989</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Mr. Siano</PERSON> said it was too early to decide on layoffs or
even the fate of the <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> office. But the office has
attracted only a few other tiny clients, such as the <ORGANIZATION>Dallas
Chamber of Commerce</ORGANIZATION>, and "we wouldn't stay there to have a <MONEY>$2
million</MONEY> office," <PERSON>Mr. Siano</PERSON> said. He added that he hoped to
find a place for many of the 45 staffers, singling out the
two top executives there, <PERSON>Thomas M. Hooke</PERSON> and <PERSON>James Hradecky</PERSON>.
Ayer also has high hopes for several accounts it is competing
for now, including <ORGANIZATION>Sterling Drug</ORGANIZATION>'s <MONEY>$20 million</MONEY> to <MONEY>$25 million</MONEY>
Bayer account.
   Penney is the latest in a string of major advertisers,
from <ORGANIZATION>Miller Lite to Benson &amp; Hedges</ORGANIZATION>, to switch agencies
without bothering with expensive, time-consuming agency
reviews. The Penney spokesman said the retailer decided
against a review because "we knew what we wanted." No doubt
switching without a pitch is far cheaper, too.
   For <PERSON>Bozell</PERSON>, the big new chunk of business helps propel its
<LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> office to <MONEY>$380 million</MONEY> billings from <MONEY>$280 million</MONEY> a
year ago, the office's <PERSON>Mr. Temerlin</PERSON> said. He was mum,
however, on how <ORGANIZATION>Bozell</ORGANIZATION> plans to improve on the Ayer slogan
for Penney: "Fashion comes to life."

   In your July 10 Advertising column "Beleaguered Ayer
Considers Going Public," written after an interview with
Glenn Corlett, Ayer's new chief financial officer, there are
some important misconceptions that I feel need to be set
straight.
   We are not going public. We want the control of our agency
in our own hands. That's the right way to serve clients.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The article touched on the fact that we are being
contacted by agencies looking for some type of partnering
arrangement with us. Since Ayer is independent, large,
profitable and has the privilege of serving a roster of
blue-chip clients, this type of contact is not surprising.
   We are not "beleaguered." We are, and always have been, a
profitable business. We are not "reeling" from account
losses. In fact, we have gained more than <MONEY>$200 million</MONEY> of new
business world-wide, including <MONEY>$70 million</MONEY> domestically in
the past six months. And we are in the finals of a number of
large and important new business presentations.
   <PERSON>Mr. Corlett</PERSON> has been here for one month. He gave the
reporter good answers to some difficult, probing questions.
How those were incorporated into the story is debatable.
   In my strong opinion, an advertising agency is a
personal-service business whose primary motivation must be to
do the very best it can for its clients. Only a private,
employee-owned agency can totally fulfill this promise.

<HEAD>Ad Exec Charges In $7.5 Million Suit That He Was Fired For Stuttering</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An advertising executive, known as one of the
industry's authorities on print media, charged in a <MONEY>$7.5 million</MONEY>
lawsuit <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> that a <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION> ad agency fired him because he
stutters.
   <PERSON>David C. Lehmkuhl</PERSON>, 42, was fired in <DATE>March</DATE> from his
<MONEY>$125,000-a-year</MONEY> position at <ORGANIZATION>Ammirati &amp; Puris Inc.</ORGANIZATION> after four months
on the job, according to the suit, which was filed in state <ORGANIZATION>Supreme
Court</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION>.
   During an <TIME>afternoon</TIME> meeting in his office, <PERSON>Edward Vick</PERSON>, the
firm's president, told <PERSON>Lehmkuhl</PERSON> he was being fired because, ``We
can't have you getting any closer to the clients,'' the suit said.
   Lehmkuhl is seeking <MONEY>$5 million</MONEY> in compensatory damages from
<ORGANIZATION>Ammirati &amp; Puris</ORGANIZATION> and <MONEY>$2.5 million</MONEY> in punitive damages.
   The plaintiff's attorney, <PERSON>Barry R. Fischer</PERSON>, said, ``I think this
will be a test case in the sense that this is a fairly high-ranking,
high executive in an industry, a well-known person and
well-compensated person who has been discriminated against in an
obvious way.''
   <PERSON>Vick</PERSON> said in a telephone interview that <PERSON>Lehmkuhl</PERSON> ``was fired for
not performing.'' He would not comment on <ORGANIZATION>Lehmkuhl</ORGANIZATION>'s stuttering.
   ``The whole case is so far off base and so without merit, there
is almost no point in getting into a discussion of the specifics,''
he said, adding that his company intended to ``vigorously defend the
case.''
   Lehmkuhl is described in a <DATE>December 1987</DATE> issue of <ORGANIZATION>Marketing &amp;
Media Decisions</ORGANIZATION>, a media trade journal, as one of the ad industry's
``most influential authorities on print media.''
   He worked for 18 years at the advertising firm <ORGANIZATION>N W Ayer Inc.</ORGANIZATION>
before being recruited by <ORGANIZATION>Ammirati &amp; Puris</ORGANIZATION>, the suit said. As senior
vice president at <ORGANIZATION>Ayer</ORGANIZATION>, he earned <MONEY>$90,000</MONEY> plus a <MONEY>$10,000</MONEY> bonus in
<DATE>1988</DATE> and had 35 to 40 people reporting to him, the suit said.
   He was assigned to many of the agency's most prestigious
accounts, including <ORGANIZATION>AT&amp;T</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Procter &amp; Gamble</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Gillette</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Ralston
Purina</ORGANIZATION>, it said.
   <PERSON>Jean Connolly</PERSON>, a member of <ORGANIZATION>Lehmkuhl</ORGANIZATION>'s media staff at <ORGANIZATION>Ayer</ORGANIZATION>, was
quoted by <ORGANIZATION>Marketing &amp; Media Decisions</ORGANIZATION> as saying: ``He is brilliant.
He has a hard time communicating his ideas verbally, but he still
has this incredible reputation behind the scenes. Talk about unsung
heroes.''
   <PERSON>Fischer</PERSON> said in a telephone interview that his client ``tended to
have top subordinates do presentation type work. But there was no
evidence that it held him back in any way. His career speaks for
itself, that he has come a tremendous way despite his disability.''
   According to the suit, <PERSON>Lehmkuhl</PERSON> decided to leave Ayer when
<ORGANIZATION>Ammirati Puris</ORGANIZATION> offered him a <MONEY>$125,000-a-year</MONEY> position as senior vice
president and director of media services, as well free use of a <ORGANIZATION>BMW</ORGANIZATION>,
a <MONEY>$10,000</MONEY> bonus and eligibility to participate in the executive
bonus pool beginning in <DATE>1989</DATE>.
   The suit says <PERSON>Vick</PERSON> had met with <PERSON>Lehmkuhl</PERSON> more than once prior to
hiring him and was aware that he stuttered.
   During his first week on the job, <PERSON>Vick</PERSON> invited him to lunch; it
proved to be the turning point in their relationship, according to
the suit.
   ``Under the stress of the new job, <PERSON>Mr. Lehmkuhl</PERSON>'s stutter was
more readily apparent,'' it said.
   ``The moment his disability manifested itself, <PERSON>Vick</PERSON> immediately
shunned <PERSON>Mr. Lehmkuhl</PERSON> and refused to offer even a modicum of
cooperation in trying to reasonably accommodate <PERSON>Mr. Lehmkuhl</PERSON>'s

   <ORGANIZATION>Pillsbury Co.</ORGANIZATION>, conceding a series of failed corporate strategies, promised major changes at its <ORGANIZATION>Burger King</ORGANIZATION> unit following the resignation of <PERSON>J. Jeffrey Campbell</PERSON>, head of its ailing restaurant business. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Pillsbury</ORGANIZATION> executives also criticized <PERSON>Burger King</PERSON>'s advertising agency, <ORGANIZATION>N W Ayer Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, at a conference for institutional investors yesterday. 
"They need to strengthen their copy," <PERSON>Roger L. Headrick</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Pillsbury</ORGANIZATION>'s chief financial officer, said of <ORGANIZATION>Ayer</ORGANIZATION>, which is responsible for <ORGANIZATION>Burger King</ORGANIZATION>'s disappointing new ad campaign, "We do it like you'd do it." 

   While <PERSON>Mr. Headrick</PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION>Pillsbury</ORGANIZATION> was "pleased" with Ayer, he said <PERSON>Burger King</PERSON>'s promotions must become more focused and effective. 
"We need to bring the customer back," he said. 

   <PERSON>Jack Rayher</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Ayer</ORGANIZATION>'s supervisor on the Burger King account, said the New York-based agency was aware of the criticism. 
"Reaction by consumers wasn't as great on certain attributes (of the campaign) as we hoped it would be, but we know now how to fix it," he said. 
New commercials will appear this <DATE>fall</DATE>, he said. 

   Burger King dropped <ORGANIZATION>WPP Group PLC</ORGANIZATION> unit <ORGANIZATION>J. Walter Thompson Co.</ORGANIZATION> in favor of <DATE>Ayer last September</DATE>, when the chain's sales failed to pick up. 
Thompson had some early successes with the fast-food giant's advertising before running into trouble with the disastrous "Herb the Nerd" and the unpopular "The Best Food for Fast Times" campaigns. 

   Ayer itself came under criticism almost from the start as industry executives derided its campaign and said that <ORGANIZATION>Ayer</ORGANIZATION>, a much smaller agency than <PERSON>Thompson</PERSON>, didn't have the network of offices needed to support regional and local marketing efforts. 
Industry sources earlier this year said <ORGANIZATION>Burger King</ORGANIZATION> was pouring <MONEY>$200 million</MONEY> into Ayer's new ad campaign. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Headrick</PERSON> said <PERSON>Burger King</PERSON> also needs to reduce employee turnover and to improve training, cleanliness and service. 
He said the world's second-largest restaurant chain -- behind <ORGANIZATION>McDonald's Corp.</ORGANIZATION> -- already is adding managers to stores and installing computer equipment "so that managers spend more time serving their customers and less on paperwork." 

   <PERSON>Mr. Campbell</PERSON>, who resigned last week as chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Pillsbury</ORGANIZATION>'s restaurant group, was to have shared the podium at the conference. 
The company is dividing his duties between two other <ORGANIZATION>Pillsbury</ORGANIZATION> officials. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Pillsbury</ORGANIZATION> also said that while it expects to report record operating earnings for the year ended <DATE>May 31</DATE>, massive restructuring charges already taken will reduce net per-share earnings to the 80-cent to 85-cent range. 
In <DATE>fiscal 1987</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Pillsbury</ORGANIZATION> earned <MONEY>$2.10</MONEY> a share. 
The <DATE>1988</DATE> per-share estimate would indicate <DATE>fourth-quarter</DATE> earnings of between <MONEY>55 cents</MONEY> and <MONEY>60 cents</MONEY>, compared with <MONEY>37 cents</MONEY> a year ago. 
Revenue for the food processor and restaurant concern rose slightly to about <MONEY>$6.20 billion</MONEY> in the latest fiscal year from <MONEY>$6.13 billion</MONEY> a year earlier, <ORGANIZATION>Pillsbury</ORGANIZATION> said. 

   In a review of the company, <ORGANIZATION>Pillsbury</ORGANIZATION>'s interim chairman, <PERSON>William H. Spoor</PERSON>, admitted to "the failures of past strategies." 
<PERSON>Mr. Spoor</PERSON> said directors recently approved a new strategic plan "that will restore our position as a premier corporation." 

   To regain momentum in its consumer foods business, he said the company would make fewer new grocery items, bucking an industry trend toward creating an avalanche of look-alike offerings. 

   While volume for the consumer foods group was up <PERCENT>1%</PERCENT> last year, profit declined because of <MONEY>$66 million</MONEY> in pretax restructuring charges required to drop five product lines, consolidate plants and cut overhead, said <PERSON>John L. Morrison</PERSON>, chairman of the packaged-foods business. 
Refrigerated dough, the group's largest business, posted good profit gains, but dessert mixes and seafoods encountered stiff competition. 
<PERSON>Mr. Morrison</PERSON> also said a disastrous effort to crack the deluxe frozen pizza market has been abandoned. 

   Most of <ORGANIZATION>Pillsbury</ORGANIZATION>'s charge-offs came on the restaurant side, where new concepts such as takeout Chinese food were abandoned and dozens of <ORGANIZATION>Burger Kings, Steak &amp; Ales</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Bennigan</ORGANIZATION>'s units were closed or remodeled. 
Company restaurant revenue declined <PERCENT>4%</PERCENT> to <MONEY>$2.6 billion</MONEY> in <DATE>fiscal 1988</DATE>, the company said, due to lower per-store sales and a major profit shortfall at Distron, the company's restaurant supply house. 
<ORGANIZATION>Pillsbury</ORGANIZATION> expects to release its final results for <DATE>1988</DATE> next week. 

   In what is expected to be his last appearance before investors, <PERSON>Mr. Spoor</PERSON> said he hopes a new chief executive officer being sought by the company would preside at <ORGANIZATION>Pillsbury</ORGANIZATION>'s annual meeting in <DATE>September</DATE>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Spoor</PERSON> came out of retirement after his hand-picked heir, <PERSON>John M. Stafford</PERSON>, resigned under pressure last <DATE>February</DATE>. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Pillsbury</ORGANIZATION> common stock closed at <MONEY>$36</MONEY>, down <MONEY>75 cents</MONEY>, in <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading yesterday.

<TEXT>
   A 25-year-old man who was put behind bars
eight years ago for rape and robbery went free after someone who
looks like him confessed, attorneys said.
   <PERSON>Randall Lynn Ayers</PERSON> _ who was sent to prison for 14 to 50 years
in <DATE>1982</DATE> in the rape, robbery and shooting of a 15-year-old girl _
was ordered released <DATE>Friday</DATE> by Common Pleas <PERSON>Judge Thomas Crush</PERSON>
after police said another man had confessed.
   ``It was a long wait,'' <PERSON>Ayers</PERSON> said. ``I didn't believe this
would happen. I had given up.''
   <PERSON>Ayers</PERSON>' attorney, <PERSON>Elizabeth Agar</PERSON>, said her client looks like the
other man. ``Basically the only evidence in the case was eyewitness
testimony,'' <PERSON>Ms. Agar</PERSON> said. ``You can see how a witness could make
a mistake.''
   Prosecutors would not identify the man who confessed.
   However, sources in the police department speaking on condition
of anonymity told <ORGANIZATION>The Cincinnati Post</ORGANIZATION> the man who confessed was
<PERSON>Robert Minton</PERSON>, 29, charged earlier this week in the slaying of two
<LOCATION>Cincinnati</LOCATION> women.
   Senior Assistant Prosecutor <PERSON>Mark Piepmeier</PERSON> asked Crush to set
aside <PERSON>Ayers</PERSON>' conviction. According to Piepmeier, a police
investigator said the man who confessed offered details of the
crime that ``fit all the way down the line.''
   The victim of the <DATE>1981</DATE> attack looked at <PERSON>Ayers</PERSON> and the man who
confessed and could not identify which was her assailant, <PERSON>Piepmeier</PERSON>
said.
   Ayers was a 17-year-old high school senior when he was charged.
The girl was robbed of <MONEY>$1</MONEY> and shot in the neck. Friends testified
at his trial that he was with them at the time.
   ``A jury convicted <PERSON>Randy Ayers</PERSON>,'' said <PERSON>Judge Crush</PERSON>. ``I
expressed the opinion at the time that I would not have convicted
him had it been tried to me.''

STUDY: 'BRAND IMAGES' NEED NURTURING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE HOROVITZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Marlboro has done a bang-up job, but <ORGANIZATION>Coca-Cola</ORGANIZATION> almost blew it. <ORGANIZATION>AT&amp;T</ORGANIZATION> is 
right on target but <ORGANIZATION>Sears</ORGANIZATION> may have lost it. 
</P>
<P>
Although <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s biggest companies are spending <MONEY>tens of billions of dollars</MONEY> 
each year to create and nurture their brand images, most are going about it the 
wrong way. That is the conclusion of a five-year consumer study to be unveiled 
in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> today by the ad agency <ORGANIZATION>N W Ayer Inc</ORGANIZATION>. In the <DATE>1990s</DATE>, the study warns, 
marketers are running the risk of losing touch with consumers. 
</P>
<P>
The problem: Most companies still don't know how to reach consumers through 
their brands. 
</P>
<P>
More than anything else, "brand image" consists of the qualities that consumers 
associate with a brand and the emotional reaction that those qualities produce. 
A favorable reaction can often result in a decision to buy one product over 
another. Marlboro's macho cowboy and <ORGANIZATION>AT&amp;T</ORGANIZATION>'s image of reliability have long 
succeeded in luring customers. But marketing experts say consumers can be 
easily confused over what a brand stands for, such as when <ORGANIZATION>Coke</ORGANIZATION> introduced its 
new formula or when <ORGANIZATION>Sears</ORGANIZATION> suddenly announced a policy of everyday low prices. 
</P>
<P>
"Brands have to become much more human so that people can relate to them in a 
human way," said <PERSON>Fred Posner</PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION>Ayer</ORGANIZATION> executive vice president who oversaw the 
study. "You need a personality and a consistency. But you can't just claim in 
your advertising that you have a personality." That personality, he said, has 
to be consistent in the product -- as well as its packaging, pricing and 
promotion. 
</P>
<P>
"The '90s will be a period of searching for identity in an increasingly 
confused and chaotic world," said <PERSON>Posner</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
In just one hour of watching television, the typical consumer sees about 30 
different commercials -- most of which are 15 or 30 seconds long. On a daily 
basis, the average consumer is bombarded with an estimated 3,000 commercial 
messages -- ranging from billboards to radio spots. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, however, a growing number of companies are investing less 
money to strengthen their brands. Today, most firms spend nearly twice as much 
on fast-sale promotions than they spend on brand image advertising. Just 20 
years ago, those figures were reversed. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been a short-term focus on quarterly profits," said <PERSON>Posner</PERSON>. But 
establishing a brand's image "is not done in a quarter. It takes careful, 
methodical support." 
</P>
<P>
This is not to say that Ayer has always excelled at creating successful brand 
images for its clients. During the past two years, it lost such major clients 
as <ORGANIZATION>Burger King</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Continental Airlines</ORGANIZATION>, which have struggled for years to 
develop clear brand images. But Ayer has seen some recent success in improving 
images for its huge retail client, <PERSON>J. C. Penney</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
Few companies have more carefully nurtured the brand image for a product than 
<ORGANIZATION>Brown-Forman Beverage Co.</ORGANIZATION>, which makes <PERSON>Jack Daniel</PERSON>'s Tennessee Whiskey. <PERSON>Jack 
Daniel</PERSON>'s has not strayed one iota from its folksy print campaign for the past 
36 years. 
</P>
<P>
That laid-back image has been created through a long-running series of 
black-and-white print advertisements. The ads are always informal photographs 
of people who work at the company's lone distillery in <LOCATION>Lynchburg</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Tenn</LOCATION>. The 
only sign of the whiskey is a tiny picture of it buried at the bottom of each 
ad. "Without a brand image, you can't expect to have any long-term success," 
said <PERSON>Rick Cahill</PERSON>, senior brand manager for <PERSON>Jack Daniel</PERSON>'s. "I attribute all of 
the success of the brand to its image."

   Discovery lost six
heat-shield tiles and sustained some ``dings'' during its four-day
mission, one of the most successful flights in the shuttle program,
<ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> officials said.
   Work on the shuttle continued <DATE>today</DATE> in a round-the-clock effort
to prepare the orbiter for its return to <LOCATION>Cape Canaveral</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla.</LOCATION>, and
its next trip into space. The piggyback ride home aboard a modified
<ORGANIZATION>Boeing</ORGANIZATION> 747 is scheduled for <DATE>Saturday</DATE>.
   Discovery landed <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME> on the hard clay bed of <ORGANIZATION>Rogers
Dry Lake</ORGANIZATION> at this <LOCATION>Mojave Desert</LOCATION> air base, capping a nearly flawless
flight that was <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s first manned space mission since the
Challenger tragedy in <DATE>1986</DATE>.
   ``Six tiles on the right wing are missing. They were no problem
_ not critical,'' said <PERSON>Ted Ayers</PERSON>, deputy site manager for the
<ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Dryden Flight
Research Facility</ORGANIZATION> here.
   ``Everything's great'' because lost tiles only pose a danger if
they are in an area that undergoes intense heating during re-entry,
<PERSON>Ayers</PERSON> said.
   ``We've got some normal dings in the tile under the vehicle,''
he added. ``These are nicks from dirt particles on the lakebed.''
   Preliminary inspection showed no damage to the shuttle's landing
gear, tires or brakes, which were improved because of brake and
tire damage during previous missions, he said.
   <PERSON>Ayers</PERSON> said the shuttle took 7,451 feet to roll to a stop when it
landed at <TIME>9:37 a.m.</TIME> <DATE>Monday</DATE>.
   After hours of initial work on the lakebed, a vehicle towed the
Discovery to the area where <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> workers began preparing it for its
return to <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>.
   Some of the first efforts included removing experiments from the
shuttle and shipping them to researchers around the nation, <PERSON>Ayers</PERSON>
said.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> shuttle boss <ORGANIZATION>Richard Truly</ORGANIZATION> said earlier <DATE>Monday</DATE> that he
walked around the shuttle after it landed.
   ``It looks beautiful,'' he said. ``There is not a lot of tile
work to be done.''
   Discovery Commander <PERSON>Rick Hauck</PERSON> said that during the flight, the
shuttle ``was like a well-oiled machine.''
   Tasks to prepare Discovery for the trip home include
deactivating fuel cells, photographing tile damage and replacing
missing tiles, purging main engines and orbital maneuvering
engines, attaching locks to prevent control flaps from fluttering,
and lifting the orbiter 60 feet in a ``mate-demate'' device that
places it atop the <ORGANIZATION>Boeing</ORGANIZATION> jet.

<HL> Burger King's New Ad Campaign Is a $200 Million Big Mac Attack </HL>

<TEXT>
   After a few years of relative calm, <PERSON>Burger King</PERSON> is about to start a new advertising campaign that attacks the way McDonald's cooks. 
And <ORGANIZATION>McDonald's Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, taking advantage of its heavyweight status, has lured <ORGANIZATION>General Motors Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Sears</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Roebuck &amp; Co.</ORGANIZATION> into what will be one of the biggest giveaways in marketing history. 
Oldsmobile alone is offering 600 cars as prizes. 

   At stake is both companies' share of the <MONEY>$25 billion</MONEY> fast-food hamburger market. 
For the past few years, <ORGANIZATION>McDonald's</ORGANIZATION> has been eating <PERSON>Burger King</PERSON>'s lunch, raising its share to <PERCENT>36%</PERCENT> while <PERSON>Burger King</PERSON>'s has slipped slightly to below <PERCENT>17%</PERCENT>. 

   Burger King's nervous franchisees, still upset over the disastrous Herb the Nerd promotion that bombed two years ago, are wondering whether the chain also has forgotten how to pitch hamburgers. 
Some analysts say that if Burger King fails to turn around soon, heads will roll at the top. 

   "I view it as the key to getting this company's earnings up and running again," says <PERSON>L. Craig Carver</PERSON>, a securities analyst at <ORGANIZATION>Dain Bosworth &amp; Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Minneapolis</LOCATION>. 
"Burger King has had virtually no advertising for the better part of a year now." 

   Neither chain, nor their ad agencies, will talk about the pending promotional blitzes. 
But industry sources say <ORGANIZATION>Burger King USA</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>Pillsbury Co.</ORGANIZATION>, is pouring <MONEY>$200 million</MONEY> into the new ad campaign by <ORGANIZATION>N.W. Ayer &amp; Co.</ORGANIZATION>, which touts broiling burgers over frying them. 
In <DATE>1982</DATE>, the last time <PERSON>Burger King</PERSON> tried that approach, hamburger sales improved. 
McDonald's also sued, claiming misleading advertising, but later settled out of court. 

   The campaign won't be aired for another two weeks. 
Franchisees who have seen the ads say one TV commercial mentions the competition. 
Noting the grill char marks on his hamburger, one youngster remarks to a buddy, "Gee, I can't get those at <ORGANIZATION>McDonald's</ORGANIZATION>." 

   McDonald's isn't saying what its response might be. 
But it, too, is planning to recycle the successful Monopoly advertising pitch it used last <DATE>spring</DATE>. 

   On <DATE>April 1</DATE>, it will roll out Monopoly II, a <MONEY>$50 million</MONEY> promotion that sources say will offer several <MONEY>$1 million</MONEY> cash prizes as well as 600 <ORGANIZATION>Oldsmobile Cutlass Supremes</ORGANIZATION> and merchandise from <ORGANIZATION>Sears</ORGANIZATION>. 

   The <ORGANIZATION>McDonald</ORGANIZATION>'s campaign makes generous use of "tie-ins," a popular advertising strategy that combines several companies in a single promotion. 
Industry sources say <ORGANIZATION>General Motors</ORGANIZATION> will spend a hefty <MONEY>$25 million</MONEY> promoting the contest and on the Oldsmobile giveaways. 
<ORGANIZATION>Sears</ORGANIZATION> wouldn't say what merchandise it would contribute or how much it would spend. 

   For <PERSON>Burger King</PERSON>, the campaign is a big test of <ORGANIZATION>Ayer</ORGANIZATION>, its new ad agency. 
Unhappy at its inability to dent <ORGANIZATION>McDonald's</ORGANIZATION>, Burger King last year dumped <ORGANIZATION>J. Walter Thompson Co.</ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION>JWT Group Inc.</ORGANIZATION> unit, in one of the biggest agency switches ever. 
McDonald's ad agency is <ORGANIZATION>Leo Burnett Co</ORGANIZATION>. 

   While declining to discuss the coming campaign, <ORGANIZATION>Ayer USA</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Jerry Siano</PERSON> said the agency would "refocus on a burger. 
That's key to whatever we're going to try." 

   Outsiders say that is the best bet. 
"Over the last five years, broiling has been the only successful strategy they've ever used," says <PERSON>Al Ries</PERSON>, a New York-based marketing strategist who has worked for Burger King. 

   Still, there is some skepticism that the approach will work this time. 
<PERSON>Mr. Reis</PERSON> says research suggests most people think Burger King hamburgers taste better, but they still show up at <ORGANIZATION>McDonald's</ORGANIZATION>. 

   "It's going to be critical to Burger King that they execute once the customer is inside the door," says <PERSON>Richard E. Pyle</PERSON>, who tracks restaurants for the <ORGANIZATION>Piper, Jaffray &amp; Hopwood</ORGANIZATION> brokerage house in <LOCATION>Minneapolis</LOCATION>. 
"The experience has to deliver the promise in the ad. 
Delivery is where the questions have been raised in the past." 

   McDonald's is practically in a no-lose situation, analysts say. 
The contest is sure to increase the number of times customers visit, says <PERSON>George Rice</PERSON>, a Chicago-based restaurant consultant. 
Last year, says <PERSON>Mr. Pyle</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>McDonald</ORGANIZATION>'s improved profit with currency gains at overseas outlets and by introducing salads. 

   "We don't anticipate either will have as much impact this year, so they'll have to bring in the traffic through some sort of promotion," he says.

<HEAD>British Philosopher A. J. Ayer Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sir <PERSON>Alfred J. Ayer</PERSON>, the British philosopher who
helped popularize the notion that all philosophy can be reduced to
linguistic analysis, died <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>. He was 78.
   Ayer died after a lengthy respiratory illness in <ORGANIZATION>University
College Hospital</ORGANIZATION>, said journalist <PERSON>Nigella Lawson</PERSON>, whose late mother,
<PERSON>Vanessa</PERSON>, was <ORGANIZATION>Ayer</ORGANIZATION>'s third wife.
   Ayer was known to generations as <PERSON>A. J. Ayer</PERSON> and to friends as
``Freddie.''
   His first book, ``Language, Truth and Logic,'' in <DATE>1936</DATE> was the
first exposition of logical positivism in the English language.
   The movement, which <ORGANIZATION>Ayer</ORGANIZATION> helped to develop in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>, expounds
the view that philosophical problems of the past can be reduced to
linguistic analysis, and that any idea that cannot in principle be
verified by sensory observation is nonsensical.
   Ranging widely between the ideas of linguistic philosophers
<PERSON>Bertrand Russell</PERSON> and <PERSON>Ludwig Wittgenstein</PERSON>, it accepts that language
must be strictly analyzed and redefined if there is any possibility
of using it as an intelligible means of logical argument.
   The philosophical school of linguistic analysts now dominates
many British and American universities.
   ``Language, Truth and Logic,'' which jolted the metaphysicians by
its assault on ``much of what has passed for philosophy,'' owed a
debt to empiricists such as <PERSON>Russell</PERSON> and <PERSON>Rudolph Carnap</PERSON>. It brought
the term ``logical positivist'' to the attention of British
academics.
   ``I maintain that there is nothing in the nature of philosophy to
warrant the existence of conflicting philosophical `schools,''' he
wrote. ``And I attempt to substantiate this by providing a
definitive solution of the problems which have been the chief
sources of controversy between philosophers in the past.''
   ``The principles of logic and metaphysics are true simply because
we never allow them to be anything else,'' he added.
   Ayer wrote ``The Foundations of Empirical Knowledge'' in <DATE>1940</DATE> and
``The Problem of Knowledge'' in <DATE>1956</DATE>, as well as volumes of
philosophical essays and histories of modern philosophy in which he
extended the traditions of British empiricism.
   Born <DATE>Oct. 29, 1910</DATE>, <PERSON>Ayer</PERSON> was the only child of a French-Swiss
father and a Dutch-Jewish mother. His father, <PERSON>Jules</PERSON>, a timber
merchant, became a naturalized British subject before the birth of

<TEXT>
   The advertising agency <ORGANIZATION>Lord Geller Federico
Einstein Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, in turmoil since a number of top-level executives
quit to form their own agency in mid-March, said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> it has
added two senior executives from other advertising agencies to its
management team.
   The agency, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>WPP Group PLC</ORGANIZATION>, named <PERSON>Agi Clark</PERSON>, a 19-year
veteran of the agency <ORGANIZATION>N.W. Ayer</ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON>Tim Elliott</PERSON>, formerly of
<ORGANIZATION>Ogilvy &amp; Mather</ORGANIZATION>, to senior management.
   <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> was named executive vice president and managing director
for creative services at <ORGANIZATION>Lord Geller</ORGANIZATION>. She had been with Ayer for 19
years, most recently overseeing creative work on the <ORGANIZATION>AT&amp;T
Communications</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Gillette</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>J.C. Penney</ORGANIZATION> accounts, <PERSON>Lord Geller</PERSON>
announced.
   <PERSON>Elliott</PERSON> was named <PERSON>Lord Geller</PERSON>'s chief operating officer. At
<ORGANIZATION>Ogilvy &amp; Mather</ORGANIZATION>, he had worked on the <ORGANIZATION>American Express Co.</ORGANIZATION> account.
   They join the current management group which includes <PERSON>Norman
Geller</PERSON> as chairman, <PERSON>Gene Federico</PERSON> as vice chairman and <PERSON>J. William
Wardell</PERSON> as president.
   The agency has been in tumult since <DATE>March 18</DATE> when six top
executives, including <PERSON>Lord Geller</PERSON> founders <PERSON>Richard Lord</PERSON> and <PERSON>Arthur
Einstein Jr.</PERSON>, walked off the job. The executives said they felt

last <DATE>summer</DATE> of the <ORGANIZATION>JWT Group Inc</ORGANIZATION>.
   They have formed their own agency, <LOCATION>Lord</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Einstein</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>O'Neill &amp;

<TEXT>
   <ORGANIZATION>Burger King Corp.</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> unveiled an
advertising campaign featuring a new slogan and original songs by
well-known artists, less than six months after a marketing overhaul
at the nation's second-largest fast-food chain.
   The eight television and 10 radio spots, many featuring the
slogan ``Sometimes you've gotta break the rules,'' are scheduled to
air next month across the country.
   Burger King, which budgeted nearly <MONEY>$215 million</MONEY> for advertising
this year, replaced <ORGANIZATION>N.W. Ayer Inc.</ORGANIZATION> with two New York-based
advertising agencies in <DATE>April</DATE> and hired an executive from rival
<ORGANIZATION>Hardee</ORGANIZATION>'s to help remold the company's image after several marketing
flops and sluggish sales.
   ``There will be a lot less emphasis on the product itself and
more of a focus on how people will perceive the company as a
whole,'' said <PERSON>Gary Langstaff</PERSON>, executive vice president for
marketing, who left No.3 <ORGANIZATION>Hardee</ORGANIZATION>'s in <DATE>April</DATE>.
   Ayer, which held the Burger King account for about a year,
created the ``We Do It Like You'd Do It'' campaign. Analysts blamed
lackluster advertising, frequent management changes and
inconsistent quality for <PERSON>Burger King</PERSON>'s recent failure to keep pace
with No. 1 <ORGANIZATION>McDonald's</ORGANIZATION>.
   Miami-based <ORGANIZATION>Burger King</ORGANIZATION> has average annual store sales of about
<MONEY>$1 million</MONEY>, compared with <ORGANIZATION>McDonald's</ORGANIZATION> nearly <MONEY>$1.6 million</MONEY> per store.
   The new television ads, designed by <ORGANIZATION>D'Arcy Masius Benton &amp;
Bowles</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Advertising</ORGANIZATION>, will premier <DATE>Oct. 4</DATE>. They
feature light-hearted sketches, including an aircraft carrier crew
anxiously awaiting its ``orders'' of hamburgers and a teen-age boy
fantasizing about a date in one of the restaurants.
   For the radio ads, top performers such as <PERSON>Mel Torme</PERSON>, blues
singer <PERSON>John Lee Hooker</PERSON> and rapper Tone-Loc wrote original songs
incorporating the new slogan. During a two-week period beginning
<DATE>Oct. 1</DATE>, the ads will be run about 1,000 times nationwide, said
<ORGANIZATION>Burger King</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON>Cori Zywotow</PERSON>.
   Spanish-language songs will be aired in several major Hispanic
markets, such as <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>San Antonio</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>.
   Burger King, which laid off about a third of its 1,500
non-restaurant employees in <DATE>April</DATE>, also announced several new
programs for workers in conjunction with the new ad campaign.
   Employees selected by management for extraordinary customer
service will be featured in upcoming television commercials and
paid actors' wages. Also, employee ideas will be used in a redesign
of restaurant staff uniforms.
   The company plans to establish a toll-free customer complaint
and information line next year.
   ``A year from now, we will look much different,'' said <PERSON>Barry
Gibbons</PERSON>, chief executive officer of the Miami-based chain.
   Food and beverage giant <ORGANIZATION>Grand Metropolitan PLC</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Great Britain</LOCATION>
acquired <ORGANIZATION>Burger King</ORGANIZATION> from <ORGANIZATION>Pillsbury Co.</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>January</DATE>. Burger King
operates about 5,900 restaurants worldwide and reported sales last
year of more than <MONEY>$5.4 billion</MONEY>.

<HEAD>Attorney General Denies He Protected Aide During Leak
Investigation</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: SUBS 3rd graf to remove redundant full reference to Ayer</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General <PERSON>Dick Thornburgh</PERSON> has denied
that he tried to cover up when a top aide showed deception on a lie
detector test while the <ORGANIZATION>Justice Department</ORGANIZATION> was investigating news
leaks.
   <PERSON>Thornburgh</PERSON> said Deputy Attorney General <PERSON>Donald B. Ayer</PERSON>, the
agency's departing No. 2 official, was ``sadly misinformed'' in
criticizing how the case was handled.
   Ayer, who has resigned effective <DATE>Friday</DATE>, has charged that
<PERSON>Thornburgh</PERSON> mishandled the <ORGANIZATION>Justice Department</ORGANIZATION>'s investigation in an
attempt to protect <PERSON>Robert S. ``Robin'' Ross</PERSON>, a longtime <PERSON>Thornburgh</PERSON>
aide.
   ``The attorney general was participating in an effort to prevent
appropriate disclosure and evaluation through established
procedures of the activities that earlier this week resulted in
<PERSON>Robin Ross</PERSON>' abrupt removal from office,'' Ayer was quoted as saying
in <DATE>Sunday</DATE>'s <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> Times.
   Sources speaking on condition of anonymity have told <ORGANIZATION>The
Associated Press</ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON>Ross</PERSON> and another veteran <PERSON>Thornburgh</PERSON> aide,
<PERSON>David Runkel</PERSON>, showed deception on polygraph tests. The tests were
given as part of the department's attempt to find who leaked
information to reporters about an investigation into alleged
financial irregularities involving Rep. <PERSON>William Gray</PERSON>, D-Pa.
   Thornburgh, appearing <DATE>Sunday</DATE> on ABC-TV's ``This Week With <PERSON>David
Brinkley</PERSON>'' program, replied, ``Absolutely not'' when asked if he
tried to conceal <PERSON>Ross</PERSON>'s performance on the lie detector test.
   ``We conducted an investigation into leaks. There was no
evidence that tied any person on my staff to the unauthorized
disclosure of that information,'' <PERSON>Thornburgh</PERSON> said.
   The attorney general also said that failing a polygraph test
``isn't evidence of wrongdoing _ not in our courts of law.''
   <PERSON>Thornburgh</PERSON> said he was saddened that Ayer ``feels that he has to
lash out against his former colleagues, but there is no basis in
fact for that kind of story.''
   The <ORGANIZATION>Justice Department</ORGANIZATION> has had a series of high-level personnel
changes since Ayer announced <DATE>May 11</DATE> that he was leaving.
   <PERSON>Ross</PERSON> resigned three days later as <PERSON>Thornburgh</PERSON>'s executive
assistant to head a new international division. He said he plans to
leave the department in two or three months. <PERSON>Runkel</PERSON> was reassigned
from serving as spokesman, taking on the new title of director of
communications.
   In the <ORGANIZATION>Los Angeles Times</ORGANIZATION> interview, Ayer criticized the way
<PERSON>Thornburgh</PERSON> dealt with the Gray case. Thornburgh had ordered the
investigation into the leaks _ which Democrats charged were
politically motivated _ last <DATE>spring</DATE> while Gray was running for the
<ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> majority whip post.
   Ayer said <PERSON>Thornburgh</PERSON> tried to keep the results of the leak
investigation out of the hands of the department's internal
watchdog agency, the <ORGANIZATION>Office of Professional Responsibility</ORGANIZATION>.
Unsuccessful in that attempt, <PERSON>Thornburgh</PERSON> then refused to follow the
unit's recommendation for further investigation, Ayer told the
newspaper.
   Ayer did not return a telephone call <DATE>Sunday</DATE> seeking comment.
   Thornburgh reported to <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>September</DATE> that the criminal
investigation of the Gray leak failed to identify the source of the
story.
   The attorney general told <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> the head of <ORGANIZATION>OPR</ORGANIZATION> had concurred
with the conclusion to drop the investigation. But <ORGANIZATION>Ayer</ORGANIZATION> said the
internal watchdog agency had never seen the report.
   When <ORGANIZATION>Ayer</ORGANIZATION> and two other top officials suggested to <LOCATION>Thornburgh</LOCATION> on
<DATE>Jan. 30</DATE> that he remove himself from the case and turn it over to
the watchdog agency, the attorney general ``rejected our advice out
of hand,'' <PERSON>Ayer</PERSON> said.
   Ultimately the case went to <ORGANIZATION>OPR</ORGANIZATION>, after prodding by <PERSON>Sen. Joseph
Biden</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-Del.</LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>Senate Judiciary Committee</ORGANIZATION>.
   After the <ORGANIZATION>OPR</ORGANIZATION> review was finished, <PERSON>Thornburgh</PERSON> turned the issue
over to Solicitor General <PERSON>Kenneth Starr</PERSON>, who concurred with the
attorney general's decision not to discipline any department
officials.

   ``A Cry in the Dark'' (<ORGANIZATION>Warner Home Video</ORGANIZATION>. VHS-Beta, <MONEY>$89.95</MONEY>.
Rated PG-13)
   
   Another movie with Meryl Streep showing off a foreign accent.
That was the joke last fall when the prodigious actress starred in
``A Cry in the Dark'' as an Australian mother wrongfully accused of
murdering her infant daughter.
   But this grim tale, based on a true story, is a lot more than a
vehicle for Streep to astonish with her facility for the cadences
of an exotic dialect. It's a gripping account of how press, police
and prosecutors unwittingly conspired to send an innocent woman to
jail for several years.
   Streep plays <PERSON>Lindy Chamberlain</PERSON>, wife of a Seventh-day Adventist
minister and mother of three young children, who goes on a camping
trip with her family to mammoth <ORGANIZATION>Ayers Rock</ORGANIZATION>. One night a dingo, a
wild dog of the outback, steals into the tent where 9-week-old
<PERSON>Azaria</PERSON> is sleeping, kills the baby and runs off with her into the
wilderness.
   The film leaves no doubt this is what happened, and at first
witnesses, police and the media seem sympathetic to the family's
tragedy. But as time goes by and no body is found _ only some
bloodstained clothes _ gossip and speculation begin to arise in the
tabloid press and on television talk shows that <PERSON>Mrs. Chamberlain</PERSON>
may have killed the child herself.
   Various forensic ``experts'' add credence to this theory from
studying the blood and rips on the baby's garments, and soon <PERSON>Mrs.
Chamberlain</PERSON> is on trial for murder and her husband as an accessory.
Both are convicted, and she is sentenced to life imprisonment at
hard labor, while pregnant with her fourth child.
   Streep's performance is impressive, especially her refusal to
soften the mother's aloof, at times hard-bitten personality, which
prevents the jury from sympathizing with her. <PERSON>Sam Neill</PERSON> does well
in the less-interesting role of her husband, who suffers a crisis
of faith and even turns on his wife when the pressure becomes too
much for him.
   Director <PERSON>Fred Schepisi</PERSON> maintains a claustrophobic atmosphere
that keeps our attention riveted on the seemingly unbelievable
nightmare into which the Chamberlains are dragged. He and <PERSON>Robert
Caswell</PERSON> adapted their screenplay from <PERSON>John Bryson</PERSON>'s book ``Evil
Angels.''
   The moviemakers' timing was better than they could have
anticipated. Last <DATE>September</DATE>, just as the film was about to be
released, <PERSON>Mrs. Chamberlain</PERSON> was formally cleared of all charges.
   Not a movie for a casual night's light entertainment, but a
strong, provocative piece of work that documents with chilling
realism one of the more amazing criminal justice stories of our
time.

   <PERSON>Tim Elliott</PERSON>, 40, a former senior vice president and group director at <ORGANIZATION>Ogilvy &amp; Mather</ORGANIZATION>, was named chief operating officer. 
<PERSON>Agi Clark</PERSON>, 46, a senior vice president and managing director of creative services at <ORGANIZATION>N.W. Ayer</ORGANIZATION>, was named executive vice president and managing director of creative services. 

   The two were brought in by <ORGANIZATION>WPP</ORGANIZATION>'s chief executive officer, <PERSON>Martin Sorrell</PERSON>, to fill a management gap caused by the walkout of the agency's six top executives last month. 
The new managers join the agency's three remaining top executives: <PERSON>J. William Wardell</PERSON>, president; <PERSON>Norman Geller</PERSON>, chairman; and <PERSON>Gene Federico</PERSON>, who yesterday was named vice chairman, relinquishing the title of director of creative services he assumed after the exodus. 

   "I hope it's going to be a partnership between the five of us. 
We'll each exert our strengths rather than it being hierarchical," <PERSON>Mr. Elliott</PERSON> said yesterday. 
<PERSON>Mr. Wardell</PERSON> added that <PERSON>Lord Geller</PERSON> doesn't plan to hire any other top managers soon, but will concentrate on bringing in "next tier" operating people. 
More than 30 people have quit since the top executives walked out to form a new agency last month; most of them have joined the new agency. 

   <PERSON>Ms. Clark</PERSON> succeeds <PERSON>Kevin O'Neill</PERSON>, one of the departed executives. 
At <ORGANIZATION>Ayer</ORGANIZATION>, she was the top creative executive on the <ORGANIZATION>AT&amp;T Communications</ORGANIZATION> business, including its "Reach Out and Touch Someone" campaign. 

   The 19-year Ayer veteran said that when she first met with <PERSON>Mr. Sorrell</PERSON> almost two weeks ago at the suggestion of a headhunter, "I expected this ogre with 20 horns. 
But I liked him. 
I think he's a straight-talking man." 
She said that a first step when she starts <DATE>Monday</DATE> will be to bring in new people, perhaps drawing on employees from <PERSON>Lord Geller</PERSON>'s sister agency <ORGANIZATION>J. Walter Thompson Co.</ORGANIZATION>, and on free-lancers. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Elliott</PERSON> was the lead account manager on <ORGANIZATION>Ogilvy</ORGANIZATION>'s largest account, <ORGANIZATION>American Express Co</ORGANIZATION>. 
At <PERSON>Lord Geller</PERSON>, he succeeds <PERSON>Edward D. Yaconetti</PERSON>, one of the six departed executives. 
He said that <PERSON>Mr. Sorrell</PERSON> made it clear that "he doesn't want to interfere in the operation." 

   Neither executive would comment on pay, but industry executives say <PERSON>Mr. Sorrell</PERSON> offered generous compensation packages, including some guarantees if the agency runs into problems. 
The executives' positions at their previous agencies haven't yet been filled.

   Thornburgh Suffers One More Setback;
   Aide Quits After Dispute on Sentencing

<LP>
   WASHINGTON -- Attorney General Dick Thornburgh suffered
another public embarrassment when a senior Justice Department
official resigned two weeks after he was forced to rescind
his endorsement of tougher sentencing guidelines for
corporate crime.
   The departure of Donald Ayer, the deputy attorney general,
reflects continued resentment within the Justice Department
of Mr. Thornburgh's heavy reliance on a small group of
longtime personal aides. The resignation, effective May 25,
also adds to a string of high-visibility setbacks for the
attorney general, who as a two-term governor of Pennsylvania
had been widely hailed as a savvy politician and manager.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> nominated <PERSON>William Barr</PERSON>, an assistant
attorney general, to succeed <PERSON>Mr. Ayer</PERSON>. The selection requires
<ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> approval.
   In a statement released <DATE>Friday</DATE>, <PERSON>Mr. Ayer</PERSON> said he had
decided to return to his partnership in the <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION>,
office of a large <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION> law firm, <PERSON>Jones</PERSON>, Day, <ORGANIZATION>Reavis &amp;
Pogue</ORGANIZATION>. In a letter, <PERSON>Mr. Thornburgh</PERSON> praised <PERSON>Mr. Ayer</PERSON>'s
"valuable contributions" during his six months in office.
   But the bland public exchange only thinly veiled the
underlying tension over <PERSON>Mr. Thornburgh</PERSON>'s management style.
<PERSON>Mr. Ayer</PERSON> is known to have been unhappy that despite his
formal designation as the attorney general's top deputy, he
was in fact outranked by a handful of <PERSON>Mr. Thornburgh</PERSON>'s
personal assistants from the <LOCATION>Harrisburg</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pa.</LOCATION>, statehouse.
   The three most prominent <PERSON>Thornburgh</PERSON> assistants -- <PERSON>Robert
Ross</PERSON>, <PERSON>David Runkel</PERSON> and <PERSON>Murray Dickman</PERSON> -- have been the
targets of persistent criticism from some current and former
<ORGANIZATION>Justice Department</ORGANIZATION> employees, who complain that the
<PERSON>Thornburgh</PERSON> team lacks the experience to lead the
75,000-person agency.
   <PERSON>Mr. Ayer</PERSON>, 41 years old, couldn't be reached for comment. A
conservative former law clerk to Chief Justice <PERSON>William
Rehnquist</PERSON>, he previously served as the <ORGANIZATION>Justice Department</ORGANIZATION>'s
deputy solicitor general and as <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> attorney in <LOCATION>Sacramento</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Calif</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Mr. Ayer</PERSON>'s chief assistant, <PERSON>Peter Nowinski</PERSON>, also quit.
   <PERSON>Mr. Thornburgh</PERSON> instructed his senior staff not to discuss
the Ayer resignation, according to one aide. An
administration official familiar with the matter called it
"an unfortunate situation" and "just one of those things that
didn't work out."
   Specifically, the attorney general is said to have been
disappointed by <PERSON>Mr. Ayer</PERSON>'s execution of several assignments
that resulted in public criticism of the <ORGANIZATION>Justice Department</ORGANIZATION>.
   Chief among these was <PERSON>Mr. Ayer</PERSON>'s written endorsement in
<DATE>February</DATE> of tougher federal sentencing guidelines for
corporate crimes. After big business lobbyists complained to
the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> and President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s counsel indicated
concern, the attorney general ordered <PERSON>Mr. Ayer</PERSON> to rescind the
endorsement, pending further review. When the decision to
back off from the tougher sentencing guidelines became the
subject of politically embarrassing news reports, <PERSON>Thornburgh</PERSON>
aides blamed <PERSON>Mr. Ayer</PERSON> for acting without approval from his
boss.
   In earlier public missteps, <PERSON>Mr. Thornburgh</PERSON> saw his initial
choice for the deputy attorney general's job shot down by
<ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> conservatives and his recommendation for civil rights
chief rejected by <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> liberals.
   <PERSON>Mr. Barr</PERSON>, the nominee to replace <PERSON>Mr. Ayer</PERSON>, has made a name
for himself as the author of controversial legal opinions
authorizing <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> agents to snatch fugitives abroad without
the approval of foreign governments, and justifying the use
of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> military forces to conduct American law-enforcement
missions in other countries. The <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> named <PERSON>Mr. Barr</PERSON>'s
top assistant, <PERSON>Michael Luttig</PERSON>, to succeed him as assistant
attorney general in charge of the <ORGANIZATION>Office of Legal Counsel</ORGANIZATION>.
   Separately, the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> named <PERSON>Robert Bonner</PERSON>, a federal
trial judge in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, to succeed <PERSON>John Lawn</PERSON> as chief of
the <ORGANIZATION>Drug Enforcement Administration</ORGANIZATION>, a branch of the <ORGANIZATION>Justice
Department</ORGANIZATION>.

   ``A Cry in the Dark''
   
   A deeply religious Australian family goes on a camping vacation
at the site of <ORGANIZATION>Ayers Rock</ORGANIZATION>, which rises like a monstrous carbuncle
from the flat, desolate land. One evening the wife returns to the
tent in time to see a dingo, a wild dog of the outback, escape into
the darkness. The nine-week-old baby <LOCATION>Azaria</LOCATION> is missing.
   Search of the surrounding territory fails to locate the baby. The
sorrowing couple returns home and discovers the disappearance has
become a national sensation. Television and the tabloid press raise
doubts about the mother's story, and she is arrested on a charge of
murder. Pregnant with her fourth child, she is convicted and
sentenced to life imprisonment at hard labor.
   A grim, harrowing story that happens to be true. The events are
told with apparent fidelity in the <ORGANIZATION>Warner Bros.</ORGANIZATION> release ``A Cry in
the Dark,'' starring Meryl Streep and <PERSON>Sam Neill</PERSON> and directed by <PERSON>Fred
Schepisi</PERSON>. The screenplay was written by <PERSON>Schepisi</PERSON> and <PERSON>Robert Caswell</PERSON>,
taken from <PERSON>John Bryson</PERSON>'s book, ``Evil Angels.''
   Meryl Streep as <PERSON>Lindy Chamberlain</PERSON> adds another of her impeccable
portrayals of tormented women, this time affecting an Australian
accent. Curiously, it is her performance itself that prevents ``A
Cry in the Dark'' from becoming a completely absorbing film. Her
<PERSON>Lindy</PERSON> is so cool and sardonic that she repells sympathy rather than
attracts it (this reportedly was true with the real-life defendant).
   <PERSON>Sam Neill</PERSON> contributes a well-shaded portrait of a husband
perplexed and bewildered by the onrush of events. Schepisi's
direction matches the heaviness of the story. He seems obsessed by
the imagery of the huge rock, the significance of which is not
readily apparent. The venality of the news media, while perhaps
historically accurate, also seems overplayed.
   Despite its deficiencies, ``A Cry in the Dark'' is a valuable and
courageous document, showing how ignorance and hysteria can inflame
a ruinous miscarriage of justice. Only this <DATE>September</DATE> was <PERSON>Lindy
Chamberlain</PERSON> finally cleared of all charges. That is noted in a
postscript to the movie, added just before the release.
   Menahem Golan and <PERSON>Yoram Globus</PERSON> were executive producers, and
<ORGANIZATION>Verity Lambert</ORGANIZATION> produced, with <PERSON>Roy Stevens</PERSON> as line producer. The
rating is PG, with scary elements for the very young. Running time:
121 minutes.

   WHITE SULPHUR SPRINGS, W.Va. -- The ad industry's top
executives meet today to tackle their biggest marketing
challenge: persuading their clients to spend money.
   As the annual conference of the American Association of
Advertising Agencies convenes, recession-weary advertisers
are cutting ad spending at an alarming rate. Times are so
tough for ad agencies that conference attendance at the
Greenbrier, a genteel golf-and-tennis resort where rooms can
top $500 a day, is at its lowest ebb in more than a decade.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Fewer than 450 executives are expected, down from more
than 600 <DATE>last year</DATE> and a far cry from the <DATE>1981</DATE> high of more
than 800. "The economy in general is bad -- and the
advertising economy is very bad," says <PERSON>John O'Toole</PERSON>, the
trade association's president. The title of his keynote
speech today: "Remembering a Year Best Forgotten."
   Trying desperately to reverse the ad-spending trend,
executives here have armed themselves with piles of studies,
which all come to the same conclusion: Advertisers that
continue to spend or even increase ad spending during a
recession gain market share at the expense of rivals. The ad
executives are mounting their own ad campaigns to try to get
that message across.
   The association itself is about to unveil a series of ads
featuring top executives, including <PERSON>Ira C. Herbert</PERSON>, president
of <ORGANIZATION>Coca-Cola Co.</ORGANIZATION>'s North American operations, saying things
like, "The surest, swiftest way to achieve corporate
anonymity is to stop advertising." The media has joined in
the act with similar ads. The <ORGANIZATION>Newspaper Advertising Bureau</ORGANIZATION>
this week announced a campaign suggesting that "trimming
newspaper from your ad budget" will lead to "a cut in sales."
The Wall Street Journal has run an ad summarizing recession
research and saying, "recessionary advertising works."
   The ad industry, though, may be talking to itself -- and
clients may not be listening. The ad agency association, for
example, has distributed more than 4,000 booklets capsulizing
research showing the benefits of advertising during economic
downturns titled, "Advertising in a Recession: The <ORGANIZATION>Best
Defense</ORGANIZATION> is a Good Offense."
   "Can I tell you a lot of advertisers have changed their
minds because of this?" asks <PERSON>Keith Reinhard</PERSON>, chairman of
<ORGANIZATION>Omnicom Group</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>DDB Needham</ORGANIZATION> ad agency and outgoing chairman
of the association. "Not yet."
   The association's booklet cites the case of <ORGANIZATION>Chevrolet</ORGANIZATION>,
which increased ad spending for its fuel-saving economy
models during the <DATE>1975</DATE> recession, even as <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> cut
advertising by <PERCENT>14%</PERCENT>. Chevrolet gained market share at the
expense of its rival. A <ORGANIZATION>McGraw-Hill</ORGANIZATION> study of 468 companies
during that recession found the same pattern: Those that
maintained or increased ad spending showed better sales
growth than those that cut spending, the booklet says.
   Ad agencies, including Ayer and <ORGANIZATION>DDB Needham</ORGANIZATION>, have weighed
in with new research papers of their own. Ayer suggests
tailoring ad programs to poorer, harsher realities, citing
previous recession campaigns like the "A-1 Steak Sauce isn't
just for sirloin anymore" ads showing people slopping the
sauce on humble hamburger rather than steak. Counsels the
Ayer report: "Top executives should cash in on the
opportunity that rival companies {with lower ad spending} are
creating for them."
   The most ambitious of the new studies comes from <ORGANIZATION>WPP
Group's Center for Research &amp; Development</ORGANIZATION>. The study analyzed
749 businesses over a four-year period and found that
"advertisers who increase spending -- whether modestly or
aggressively -- achieve greater market-share gains than those
who cut their advertising investment." The study would have
seemed like a good marketing tool for <ORGANIZATION>WPP</ORGANIZATION> units <ORGANIZATION>Ogilvy &amp;
Mather</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>J. Walter Thompson</PERSON>, except that <ORGANIZATION>WPP</ORGANIZATION> didn't take
its own advice: Immediately after the study was issued <DATE>last
fall</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>WPP</ORGANIZATION> closed the center's doors in a cost-cutting move.
   Ad executives are well aware that they are preaching to
the converted as they tell each other how important it is for
clients to continue spending. But like the annoying chant of
<ORGANIZATION>Wisk</ORGANIZATION>'s "Ring around the collar," they won't be silenced.
"We've got to keep it up and wear away to show advertisers
that it is in their interest to advertise during a
recession," says the association's <PERSON>Mr. O'Toole</PERSON>. "It doesn't
necessarily work overnight."

   <ORGANIZATION>Ayer Loses Citibank
                                                                                                       

   Citicorp</ORGANIZATION> pulled its estimated <MONEY>$10 million</MONEY> <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> branch
<ORGANIZATION>Citibank</ORGANIZATION> account from <ORGANIZATION>Ayer</ORGANIZATION> and awarded it to <ORGANIZATION>Foote</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Cone &amp;
Belding</ORGANIZATION>, the Chicago-based agency that handles the bulk of
<ORGANIZATION>Citicorp</ORGANIZATION>'s account.
   "We're continuing to develop a global communications
strategy to make sure that there's consistency among our
businesses world-wide, particularly on the advertising side,"
a spokesman explained the consolidation. The account is
expected to be serviced at <ORGANIZATION>Foote Cone</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> agency,
FCB/Leber <ORGANIZATION>Katz Partners</ORGANIZATION>.
   Ayer told its employees that this won't affect the
agency's role on <ORGANIZATION>Citicorp</ORGANIZATION>'s corporate account, but officials
at both <ORGANIZATION>Ayer</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Citicorp</ORGANIZATION> said that account isn't active.
"Conflicts and consolidations are a world-wide reality of
this business," said <PERSON>Dom Rossi</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Ayer</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>
office. "We wish <ORGANIZATION>Citibank</ORGANIZATION> well." Ayer's direct marketing unit
will continue to do work for <ORGANIZATION>Citicorp</ORGANIZATION> bank cards.
   <ORGANIZATION>Foote Cone</ORGANIZATION> handles bank advertising for branches in
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, and a number of other states, and
<ORGANIZATION>Citicorp</ORGANIZATION> advertising in more than 10 countries. In late <DATE>1989</DATE>,
<ORGANIZATION>Citicorp</ORGANIZATION> awarded the <ORGANIZATION>Citicorp Savings Illinois</ORGANIZATION> account, which
had been handled at <ORGANIZATION>Ayer</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> office, to <ORGANIZATION>Foote Cone</ORGANIZATION>.

   EVEREADY UPDATE: Following a judge's decision yesterday,
<ORGANIZATION>Adolph Coors</ORGANIZATION> said it plans to immediately begin airing a
Coors Light commercial parodying the Energizer bunny ads.
Judge <PERSON>Charles R. Nogle Sr.</PERSON> in federal court in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> denied
<ORGANIZATION>Eveready Battery Co.</ORGANIZATION>'s motion that sought to block Coors from
airing the spot. The commercial shows actor <PERSON>Leslie Nielsen</PERSON>
decked in bunny ears and banging a big drum. Coors's
"imitation of the Energizer bunny is far from excessive," the
judge wrote. "<PERSON>Mr. Nielsen</PERSON> is not a toy {mechanical or
otherwise}, does not run on batteries, is not 15 inches tall,
is not predominantly pink, {and} does not wear sunglasses or
beach thongs." Eveready, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>Ralston Purina</ORGANIZATION>, said it
will continue its suit in federal court if Coors airs the
spot.
                                                                                                       

   AGENCY SWITCH: <ORGANIZATION>Newmark &amp; Lewis</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Hicksville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>, named
<ORGANIZATION>Partners &amp; Shevack</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, to handle its estimated <MONEY>$18
million</MONEY> account. New York-based Ayer was assigned the account
just <DATE>three weeks ago</DATE>, but the consumer-electronics chain
changed its mind and decided the campaign <ORGANIZATION>Partners &amp; Shevack</ORGANIZATION>
pitched would better serve the company, said <PERSON>Dick Lewis</PERSON>,
co-chairman.
                                                                                                       

   FINALISTS: <ORGANIZATION>Subaru of America</ORGANIZATION> named six finalists for its
<MONEY>$60 million</MONEY> ad account: <ORGANIZATION>Warwick Baker & Fiore; W.B. Doner &amp;
Co.</ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON>Jordan</PERSON>, <PERSON>McGrath</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Case & Taylor</ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION>DCA</ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION>Wieden & Kennedy</ORGANIZATION>;
and the incumbent, <PERSON>Levine</PERSON>, <PERSON>Huntley</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Vick &amp; Beaver</ORGANIZATION>. Subaru is
a unit of <ORGANIZATION>Fuji Heavy Industries</ORGANIZATION>.
                                                                                                       

   SINGAPORE: <ORGANIZATION>D'Arcy Masius Benton &amp; Bowles</ORGANIZATION> extended its
equity partnership with <ORGANIZATION>Tokyu Agency International</ORGANIZATION>, the
agency's partner agency in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, to include DMB&amp;B <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION>.
The <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION> agency will now be known as <ORGANIZATION>DMB&amp;B Tokyu</ORGANIZATION>. Terms
weren't disclosed.

<HEAD>Burger King's New Ad Agency Debuts 99-Cent Promotion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   <ORGANIZATION>Burger King Co.</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> announced a month-long
national promotion developed by its new advertising agency that
features a different sandwich each weekday for <MONEY>99 cents</MONEY>.
   The daily special, which will run through <DATE>Sept. 29</DATE>, was developed
by <ORGANIZATION>Saatchi &amp; Saatchi</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>UniWorld Agency</ORGANIZATION>, which does <PERSON>Burger
King</PERSON>'s minority advertising.
   It's the first work done by <ORGANIZATION>New York-based Saatchi &amp; Saatchi</ORGANIZATION> for
Burger King since the fast-food giant fired <ORGANIZATION>N.W. Ayer Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, which
came up with the ``We do it like you'd do it'' theme in <DATE>June</DATE>.
   ``We are very excited about this promotion,'' said <PERSON>Gary
Langstaff</PERSON>, <PERSON>Burger King</PERSON>'s executive vice president of marketing. It
``represents some of the best promotional advertising in the
business.''
   Burger King spokeswoman <PERSON>Cori Zywotow</PERSON> said the new commercials
highlight the diversity of the chain's menu.
   ``They're just really upbeat, fast-paced spots,'' she said.
   Recent Burger King ad campaigns that met with less-than-favorable
reviews included a search for <ORGANIZATION>Herb</ORGANIZATION>, a nerd who had never been to a
<PERSON>Burger King</PERSON>, and the themes ``This is a Burger King Town'' and ``The
Best Food for Fast Times.'' Those were produced by the <PERSON>J. Walter
Thompson</PERSON> agency of <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> before the agency was replaced by <ORGANIZATION>Ayer</ORGANIZATION>
in <DATE>September 1987</DATE>.
   Burger King announced in <DATE>May</DATE> it was awarding its <MONEY>$215 million</MONEY>
account to <ORGANIZATION>Saatchi &amp; Saatchi</ORGANIZATION>, a British-owned agency that will focus
on promotions and products, and <ORGANIZATION>D'Arcy Masius Benton &amp; Bowles of New
York</ORGANIZATION>, which will concentrate on image.
   Miami-based <ORGANIZATION>Burger King</ORGANIZATION> changed hands in <DATE>January</DATE> as part of
British conglomerate <ORGANIZATION>Grand Metropolitan PLC</ORGANIZATION>'s acquisition of
<ORGANIZATION>Pillsbury Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Burger King</ORGANIZATION>'s parent.
   Burger King and its franchisees, which operate more than 5,800
restaurants worldwide, had systemwide sales of more than <MONEY>$5.4
billion</MONEY> in <DATE>fiscal 1988</DATE>.

<LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s tourist industry, starved of domestic airline services for the past 
week, is facing ruin because of widespread cancellations by nervous overseas 
visitors, operators said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Resorts and hotels reported a slump in occupancy rates since the <DATE>weekend</DATE>, when 
travelers realized that the dispute, which has grounded all domestic airlines 
since <DATE>last Thursday</DATE>, was set to continue for some time. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody's bleeding here at the moment," said <PERSON>Gaynor Cooper</PERSON>, marketing 
manager of the <LOCATION>Yulara Resort</LOCATION> in the shadow of <ORGANIZATION>Ayers Rock</ORGANIZATION> in the central 
Australian desert. 
</P>
<P>
"We would expect to be <PERCENT>100%</PERCENT> full at this time of year, but our occupancy rate 
is very low. People are canceling because they are afraid they won't be able to 
get back home," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Tourism is <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s most important foreign exchange earner and reaped <MONEY>$4.9 
billion</MONEY> from about 2.2 million visitors in the last financial year. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had quite massive cancellations from abroad. There's been a huge loss of 
confidence," said <PERSON>Owen French</PERSON>, manager of a string of island resorts off 
<LOCATION>Queensland</LOCATION>. "Overseas travel agents are just taking <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> out of the 
schedules." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Help Wanted Ads 
</P>
<P>
About 1,600 pilots resigned en masse <DATE>last week</DATE> after the three largest domestic 
airlines refused to consider their demand for a <PERCENT>30%</PERCENT> pay raise, bringing chaos 
to the transport system of the continent. 
</P>
<P>
The airlines said they had received more than 800 responses from pilots to job 
advertisements they placed in newspapers around the world. But they warned it 
would take about four weeks for the applications to be processed and new pilots 
to be trained. 
</P>
<P>
Although a few charter flights still serve tourist hot spots such as <ORGANIZATION>Ayers 
Rock</ORGANIZATION>, most foreign travelers come to <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> on multi-stop tickets, which are 
no longer feasible. 
</P>
<P>
"It's suddenly got worse since yesterday, and we're now around <PERCENT>20%</PERCENT> to <PERCENT>30%</PERCENT> down 
on normal," said <PERSON>Yvonne Singleton</PERSON>, public relations manager at <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Menzies 
Hotel</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"We're getting a lot of cancellations of groups, mainly Japanese, for 
<DATE>September</DATE>." she added.

<DATELINE>SYDNEY, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   <PERSON>Lindy Chamberlain</PERSON>, the mother in
<LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s dingo-baby case, says she is owed <MONEY>millions of dollars</MONEY> in
compensation promised nearly a year after she was found innocent of
charges she killed her infant daughter.
   <PERSON>Mrs. Chamberlain</PERSON>, who claims her 6-week-old daughter was snatched
by a dingo, a native Australian wild dog, while on a camping trip in
the <LOCATION>Outback</LOCATION>, says the notoriety has left her broke and prevented her
family from living a normal life.
   <PERSON>Mrs. Chamberlain</PERSON>, 41, who in the past has resented her trial by
media, called a news conference with selected journalists <DATE>Monday</DATE> to
generate publicity to force the <ORGANIZATION>Northern Territory</ORGANIZATION> government, which
prosecuted her and later pardoned her, to pay compensation for the
3{ years she spent in jail.
   Her ordeal, regarded as one of the miscarriages of justice in
Australian legal history, and her fight for compensation have been
front-page stories for years in Australian newspapers.
   But despite eight best-sellers about the case, <PERSON>Mrs. Chamberlain</PERSON>
claimed she had not received much money. She also said money she
received from the <DATE>1988</DATE> movie ``A Cry In The Dark,'' in which Meryl
Streep played her role, covered little more than her expenses.
   Husband <PERSON>Michael</PERSON>, 45, a former pastor with the <ORGANIZATION>Seventh Day
Adventist Church</ORGANIZATION>, said he eked out a living chopping firewood and
selling it for <MONEY>$26</MONEY> a trailer load. <PERSON>Mrs. Chamberlain</PERSON> said she could
not afford to buy new shoes for her three school-age children.
   ``People think a couple so famous should be rich,'' she said.
``Our anonymity has been blasted; we can't live a normal life. You
can't plan for the future because you don't know what that future
is.''
   The family's saga has captivated the Australian public since
<DATE>1980</DATE>, when <PERSON>Mrs. Chamberlain</PERSON> claimed a dingo killed her daughter
<PERSON>Azaria</PERSON> in the <LOCATION>Outback</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Mrs. Chamberlain</PERSON> was prosecuted for murder by the <ORGANIZATION>Northern
Territory</ORGANIZATION> government but was released following the discovery of
vital new evidence while a <ORGANIZATION>Royal Commission</ORGANIZATION>, the highest form of
investigation available, reviewed the case.
   <PERSON>Mrs. Chamberlain</PERSON> was finally pardoned last <DATE>November</DATE>. The
Chamberlains have refused to reveal the amount of compensation they
were promised, but a figure leaked to the media by the <ORGANIZATION>Northern
Territory</ORGANIZATION> government put it at around <MONEY>$3 million</MONEY>.
   Officials for the <ORGANIZATION>Northern Territory</ORGANIZATION> government could not be
reached for comment today or <DATE>Monday</DATE>.
   ``Maybe an apology is a little hard to swallow and let's face it,
compensation is an apology,'' <PERSON>Mrs. Chamberlain</PERSON> said.
   The couple said they owe about <MONEY>$1 million</MONEY> in legal costs, mostly
to the <ORGANIZATION>Seventh Day Adventist Church</ORGANIZATION>, which supported them through
their court battles.

ONE OF THE FAMILY
by Wendy W <ORGANIZATION>Fairey
W W Norton Pounds 15.95</ORGANIZATION>, 288 pages
WENDY <ORGANIZATION>FAIREY</ORGANIZATION>'S mother was <PERSON>Sheilah Graham</PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION>Fairey</ORGANIZATION> was certain of that. Most
people who know anything about <PERSON>F. Scott Fitzgerald</PERSON> know something about
<PERSON>Sheilah Graham</PERSON> and her 'College of One'. She was the East End girl who moved
from a Jewish orphanage to become a Hollywood gossip columnist and then
<ORGANIZATION>Fitzgerald</ORGANIZATION>'s love at the grim end of his days.
Between drinking and writing not-so-good stories to pay for his mad wife
<PERSON>Zelda</PERSON>'s hospital, he discovered the fun of playing <PERSON>Henry Higgins</PERSON> to a
glamorous but ill-educated young woman. The result, according to <PERSON>Sheilah</PERSON> who
wrote a bestselling book about it, was that she inspired <PERSON>Fitzgerald</PERSON> to
produce at least a part of that brilliant novel, The Last Tycoon.
All this may seem a long build-up to <PERSON>Wendy Fairey</PERSON>'s search for her identity,
but the ghost of <ORGANIZATION>Fitzgerald</ORGANIZATION> hung over her childhood as the father she had
never quite had. As it turned out, the father she thought she had was not
her actual natural father, and when she discovered his existence after her
mother died she was very pleased to acknowledge him - but he too had died,
and had done her no favours in life.
To come out with a few names, <ORGANIZATION>Fairey</ORGANIZATION>'s undistinguished first
father-in-name-only was an Englishman called <PERSON>Trevor Westbrook</PERSON> who, as it
turned out, <PERSON>Graham</PERSON> had married as a cover for the birth of her daughter -
whose actual father was the philosopher <ORGANIZATION>Freddie Ayer</ORGANIZATION>. He and her mother's
other lovers at that period were, so <ORGANIZATION>Fairey</ORGANIZATION> works out for herself, Scott
substitutes. Thus the great man inspired her birth.
The thriller element is somewhat reduced by giving us Ayer at the beginning
of the book. In fact more than half of it is about her mother, set in the
lavish world of Hollywood in the <DATE>1950s</DATE> as seen through the eyes of a clever,
swottish girl. With ironic hindsight, <ORGANIZATION>Fairey</ORGANIZATION> describes a child out of place
in her environment, who goes East as soon as possible and ends up, just like
the father she did not know at the time, a professor.
The quest to put together the pieces of the family jigsaw is told with great
intensity, an endearing honesty, but not much humour. Ayer, it turns out,
had always known about her. Perhaps unsurprisingly, when she eventually
meets him as her father, not just as a family friend, the professor,
although good-natured about it, cannot quite rise to her expectations.
Three months after this meeting, Ayer died and <ORGANIZATION>Fairey</ORGANIZATION> received the first
public acknowledgement of her new parentage in The Times' list of those
attending his funeral: 'Prof. <PERSON>Wendy Ayer</PERSON>'. That is a moment of blackish
humour.

FT  22 JAN 92 / Arts: Roy Ayers - Ronnie Scott's
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARRY BOOTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Clubowner <PERSON>Ronnie Scott</PERSON> must be confident of this showy vibraphonist's
appeal. The American has already spent a week at <ORGANIZATION>Scott</ORGANIZATION>'s new club in
<LOCATION>Birmingham</LOCATION> and follows now with a three-week residency at the <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> base.
But there are few good vibes players around and the instrument does seem to
have some pulling power on the margins of jazz: perhaps because it offers
both melody and percussion in large, equal measures or because it is played
standing up and with some vigour.
Whatever the reason, it is hard to ignore.
<PERSON>Roy Ayers</PERSON> has the added advantage of being an unrepentant showman who owns
an expensive looking piece of equipment from which he can summon all kinds
of sounds with a flick of the switch and the application of mallets. This he
does with alacrity and even managed a clever but tacky mini-tribute to Miles
Davis by hitting the trumpet button on the machine. He can play though and
when the vibes are right, backed by a tough all-American no-nonsense rhythm
section, the swirling vibrato is mesmerising.
Legend has it that <PERSON>Ayers</PERSON> was encouraged to take up the electric xylophone at
the age of five by <PERSON>Lionel Hampton</PERSON>, the original big band vibes man, when he
gave him a pair of mallets to get the young <ORGANIZATION>Ayers</ORGANIZATION> started. He moved quickly
away from a pure jazz sound, however, and by the mid-1970s was established
as an uncomplicated and entertaining fusion player.
Thus he neglects to play long, sustained solo parts throughout a set of
sweaty jazz funk. Instead the repertoire of songs with titles like 'Everyone
likes the sunshine' relies heavily on a seductive groove and the old
charmer's line of cheeky chat. He even resorts to the trusted technique of
invoking 'everyone to put their hands in the air', for example. He likes to
sing as well and has a soulful voice which delivers smoothie nonsense
reminiscent of ladies' men like <PERSON>Barry White</PERSON> or <ORGANIZATION>Luther Vandross</ORGANIZATION>.
While guitarist <PERSON>Zachery Breaux</PERSON> whacks out the soul riffs, <PERSON>Ayers</PERSON> puts down
his mallets, fixes a table at the front with a mischievous eye and sings, 'I
believe in the spirit of do-do'.
Later in the set he wiggles his ears, a seductive device which <PERSON>Ayers</PERSON>' wife
apparently finds irresistible.
On this first night more than a few in the near capacity audience seemed to
like it too.

<HL> Media and Advertising Firms Join Forces
To Launch Major Anti-Drug Campaign

   "My brother's friend <PERSON>Rick</PERSON> wanted to do something special for him for his birthday. 
He bought him some crack. . . . 
That was two years ago today," says the clean-cut teenager. 
"Maybe <PERSON>Rick</PERSON> was the lucky one. 
He died." 

   The teen leans forward, and the camera reveals a comatose young man staring blankly from a bed. 
"Happy birthday, buddy," the teen says, patting his brother. 

   America may soon be deluged by commercial messages like this. 
Starting today, in what is being billed as the biggest public-service campaign since World War II, an advertising and media partnership is launching a war against illegal drugs. 
It has asked the nation's print and broadcast media to support the three-year effort by donating a staggering <MONEY>$500 million</MONEY> of ad space and time each year -- millions more than even <ORGANIZATION>Coca-Cola Co.</ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler Corp.</ORGANIZATION> spends annually on advertising. 

   The goal is to "convince people that drug usage is not chic, not acceptable, and is plain stupid," says <PERSON>Louis T. Hagopian</PERSON>, chairman of the New York-based ad agency <ORGANIZATION>N.W. Ayer</ORGANIZATION> and former chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>American Association of Advertising Agencies</ORGANIZATION>. 
It is this trade group that last <DATE>spring</DATE> created the coalition, known as the Media-Advertising Partnership for a Drug-Free <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>. 

   Support for the campaign "has been very positive" overall, with most major media -- including Newsweek magazine, ABC-TV and The Wall Street Journal -- agreeing to participate, according to <PERSON>Richard T. O'Reilly</PERSON>, the partnership's director. 
Yet few seem willing, or in some cases able, to donate as much space or time as the partnership has asked for. 

   Most of the resistance seems to stem from the size of the request. 
The partnership is asking that the <MONEY>$1.5 billion</MONEY> total in free advertising be in addition to existing public-service spots. 
Besides plans for other outlets, it is asking that TV stations run two spots during prime time every day for the campaign's duration; that magazines publish a full-page ad every other issue; and that newspapers donate space each week. 

   The request "isn't realistic" financially, says <PERSON>John DeHoll</PERSON>, director of advertising services for Woman's Day magazine. 
"When space does come available, it's usually because a paid ad has fallen through. 
You certainly don't plan ahead for public-service advertising like this." 

   <PERSON>George Schweitzer</PERSON>, vice president of communications for <ORGANIZATION>CBS Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, adds that while his company plans to cooperate, "a specific dollar or air-time commitment . . . would be unfair to other public-service issues, such as AIDS prevention." 

   Certainly, plenty of anti-drug advertising already exists. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Advertising Council</ORGANIZATION>, a nonprofit group responsible for the majority of national public-service ads, says some <MONEY>$45 million</MONEY> of anti-drug advertising time and space was donated to it by the media in <DATE>1986</DATE> -- most of which was used for the council's "Cocaine. 
The big lie" and "Just Say 'No' to Drugs" campaigns. 
A council official estimates that total anti-drug advertising amounted to three times that much. 

   But officials in the new partnership say all that and more is needed to combat a business worth <MONEY>$110 billion</MONEY> a year -- the estimated amount Americans spend on illegal drugs. 
Although <PERSON>Mr.oO'Reilly</PERSON> concedes that "it would be unfair and unrealistic to say we're going to get everything we asked for," he expects media participation to increase after the campaign begins. 

   <PERSON>Mr. O'Reilly</PERSON> is also encouraged by the other kinds of support he's received. 
At least 200 advertising agencies have voluntarily created ads or solicited ad time and space. 
More than a dozen TV spots -- recorded on film supplied free by <ORGANIZATION>Eastman Kodak Co.</ORGANIZATION> and using actors who waived their fees -- have been shot by well-known commercial directors who donated their time. 
And a research firm has volunteered to track changes in attitudes toward drugs over the course of the campaign. 

   The ads are geared to a variety of audiences, and nearly all are intended to be powerful, even shocking. 
"I'm trying to scare you so bad that when the first kid at the locker next to you hits you with a joint or cocaine, you don't do it," says <PERSON>Cliff Einstein</PERSON>, president and creative director of <ORGANIZATION>Dailey &amp; Associates</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>. 

   <PERSON>Dailey</PERSON>'s anti-cocaine commercial shows a young businessman pulling an enormous white pistol from his desk drawer. 
He spins the chamber and, in excruciatingly slow motion, puts it to his head and pulls the trigger. 
If you have "<LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> Vice" glamorizing drugs, says <PERSON>Mr. Einstein</PERSON>, "how are you going to come back unless you're as strong on your side of the fence as they are on theirs? 
In this case, fear and terror are a legitimate deterrent." 

   Ayer, which created three TV spots for the campaign, researched attitudes and quizzed focus groups, just as it would before creating a product campaign. 
"In talking to high-school students, we learned that the key thing for them is being in control of their lives," notes <PERSON>Joy Williams-Jones</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>Ayer</ORGANIZATION> vice president who led the research. 
"They're trying to be adults. 
They can't wait to get out of the house." 

   Thus, one Ayer commercial shows a man in his 20s sitting in a living room and smoking a joint. 
He's been using marijuana for 15 years, he says, and nothing has ever happened to him: "I didn't start stealing, mugging people. 
In fact, I'd say I'm exactly the same as I was when I smoked my first joint." 
Just then, we hear his mother nagging him, and we realize he's still stuck at home. 
"Marijuana," the announcer booms, "can make nothing happen to you, too." 

   Keye/Donna/Pearlstein, the <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> ad agency that created the comatose-brother spot, also used teen focus groups. 
The sessions showed that "kids may not have a fear of drugs, but they have a fear of adulterated drugs," says <PERSON>Paul F. Keye</PERSON>, the agency's chairman and creative director. 
"Also, adolescents typically have absolutely no sense of mortality -- but they can envision being vegetables." 

   Despite the agencies' best creative efforts and research, some drug-abuse professionals question the ads' format. 
They say the ads should list groups to call for help, or at least leave space for local groups to provide names themselves. 
And some criticize the partnership for not joining forces with others fighting drugs. 

   "I did go and see them, because I wanted to have some input," says <PERSON>Carolyn Burns</PERSON>, assistant director of the <ORGANIZATION>National Federation of Parents for Drug-Free Youth</ORGANIZATION>, a Washington-based nonprofit group. 
"They never got got back to me. 
I'd still be interested in working with them." 

   <PERSON>Mr. O'Reilly</PERSON> explains that leaving space for messages from local groups isn't practical for cost reasons. 
And he claims that most of the upset groups are simply trying to increase their own exposure by adding their names to the partnership's ads. 
"People are so concerned about their turf issues that they're less concerned about what has to be done," he says. 

   Partnership members say the trouble will be worth it if the program works. 
"It will take some years . . . (but) we've got to stay with it and stay with it," says <PERSON>Phillip Joanou</PERSON>, <PERSON>Dailey</PERSON>'s chairman and chief executive, who first suggested the campaign. 
Advertising, he adds, is supposed to be "a powerful propaganda tool. 
So if it is, use it to do some good."
