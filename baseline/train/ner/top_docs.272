<HEAD>Head Of Government Inquiry Into Aboriginal Deaths Resigns</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CANBERRA, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of a government probe on the
deaths of 104 aborigines in police custody has resigned, and
indigenous activists today called the decision a devastating blow to
the inquiry.
   Prime Minister <PERSON>Bob Hawke</PERSON> said <PERSON>James Muirhead</PERSON>, federal court judge
since <DATE>1977</DATE>, resigned <DATE>late Thursday</DATE> to become administrator of the
<ORGANIZATION>Northern Territory</ORGANIZATION>.
   Aboriginal groups called the decision a blow to their cause and
expressed concern that the inquiry, set up in <DATE>1987</DATE> to investigate 44
aboriginal deaths in police custody since <DATE>1980</DATE>, could be downgraded.
   Since the inquiry began, the number of aboriginal deaths in
police custody has grown to 104, and <PERSON>Muirhead</PERSON> had said the increased
number would extend his work _ expected to be completed <DATE>last month</DATE> _
two years minimum.
   Aboriginal activists have charged police brutality as the cause.
   An interim report issued last month recommended aboriginal
recruits replace white police officers suspected of racism and that
drunkenness be abolished as a crime for aborigines.
   Most aborigines have died in police cells by hanging after being
picked up on charges of being drunk and disorderly.
   <PERSON>Hawke</PERSON> said <PERSON>Muirhead</PERSON>, who also was the judge in the <PERSON>Lindy
Chamberlain</PERSON> trial, would continue in his job until <DATE>April</DATE>. The
<PERSON>Chamberlain</PERSON> trial was the basis for the recent <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> movie starring
Meryl Streep entitled ``A Cry in the Dark.''
   The <ORGANIZATION>Black Action Group</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Committee to Defend Black Rights</ORGANIZATION>,
which represents many of the families of aborigines who have died in
custody, urged the federal government ensure that justice is not
denied the country's indigenous population following <ORGANIZATION>Muirhead</ORGANIZATION>'s
resignation.
   Aborigines, <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s original inhabitants, number about
160,000, or <PERCENT>1 percent</PERCENT> of the 16 million population. Government
figures statistics show aborigines are socially and economically
deprived.
   Aboriginal activists declared <DATE>last year</DATE>'s Bicentennial marking
European settlement a year of mourning.
   Muirhead, 63, said aborigines should not fear the probe will wind
down.
   ``I think the commission is well established,'' he said.
   No replacement was immediately named.

<HEAD>Probe Into Aborigine Deaths Looks At Why More Go To Jail</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SYDNEY, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> broadened a
probe into the deaths of aborigines in police custody to discover
why proportionately more of the native people than other
Australians end up in jail.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Royal Commission of Inquiry</ORGANIZATION> said it was concerned by
government statistics that show aborigines, about <PERCENT>1 percent</PERCENT> of the
16 million population, are six times more likely to go to jail than
white Australians.
   ``While investigation of aboriginal deaths in custody is
important, so too is learning the lessons of the past and acting to
prevent further deaths,'' said <PERSON>Elliott Johnston</PERSON>, who is heading the
inquiry.
   <PERSON>Johnston</PERSON>, a lawyer, this week replaced judge <PERSON>James Muirhead</PERSON> on
the commission, which was established by Prime Minister <PERSON>Bob Hawke</PERSON>
in mid-1987.
   Muirhead, in an interim report issued in <DATE>December</DATE>, urged states
to abolish drunkenness as a criminal offense, indicating this was
perhaps a chief reason aborigines were arrested. In <DATE>February</DATE>, the
government pledged the equivalent of <MONEY>$8 million</MONEY> to set up
drying-out facilities as an alternative to jail for people arrested
on drinking charges.
   The commission is investigating the deaths while in police
custody of 104 aborigines between <DATE>1980</DATE> and <DATE>May 31, 1987</DATE>. Some
activists blame police brutality, and others have said the jailing
causes despair, which often leads to suicide, <PERSON>Johnston</PERSON> said.
   Conclusions will be reached by year's end, he said.
   In <LOCATION>Adelaide</LOCATION>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION>South Australian Aboriginal
Deaths in Custody Watch Committee</ORGANIZATION> criticized the commission's <DATE>May
31</DATE> cutoff date.
   ``The cut-off date must be when there are no more deaths so
justice can be seen to have happened,'' said <PERSON>Mrs. Alice Dixon</PERSON>,
whose 19-year-old aboriginal son died in custody in <DATE>1987</DATE>.
   Aborigines are <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s original inhabitants, settling the
continent 40,000 years ago.

<HEAD>Report On Deaths Among Aborigines In Police Custody Urges Changes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD BILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SYDNEY, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   To stem a rash of aborigine deaths in
police custody, a government report today urged that drunkenness be
abolished as an offense and racist police officers be replaced by
aboriginal recruits.
   The preliminary report calls for widespread changes in
<LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s legal, police, prison and medical systems to tackle the
problem and warns that a failure to institute such changes would
damage <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s reputation abroad.
   It was issued by <PERSON>James Muirhead</PERSON>, a lawyer who Prime Minister <PERSON>Bob
Hawke</PERSON> appointed last year as head of a royal commission formed to
investigate the deaths of 44 aborigines in police custody since <DATE>1980</DATE>.
   The commission was to have concluded its probe this week, but the
number of aborigine deaths in police custody has more than doubled
to 100 since it began work. Most aborigines have died in police
cells by hanging after being picked up on charges of being drunk and
disorderly.
   Aboriginal activists charge police brutality.
   <PERSON>Muirhead</PERSON> said the increase in his workload means the final report
will be delayed by two years. In the meantime, he issued 56
recommendations to prevent more aborigines from dying in custody.
   In the report, <PERSON>Muirhead</PERSON> also criticizes attempts that have been
made to hamper his investigation.
   ``It will be unfortunate if the work of this commission is
impeded by narrow, selfish or political considerations,'' he says.
``Our performance is being assessed not only in this country but in
overseas forums and I fear that our country's reputation will suffer
if expediency rather than honesty prevails.
   ``<LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> must know the truth behind the deaths or else we must
forever live with the knowledge that our fear of the truth or our
misguided sense of priorities caused us to abandon an essential and
momentous decision to examine a little of our national character and
the behavior of people in authority.'' In <LOCATION>Western Australia</LOCATION>, the
state where there the most deaths have occurred, police and prison
officers' unions, backed by the state government, have launched a
federal court challenge to some of the commission's powers.
   A royal commission has wider powers than any judicial body in the
country, but is not empowered to pass legal judgment. Its findings,
however, can result in legal action at the state and federal level.
   Aborigines, the country's original inhabitants, number about
160,000, or <PERCENT>1 percent</PERCENT> of <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s 16 million people.
   The inquiry comes at a particularly sensitive time with ongoing
bicentennial celebrations marking European settlement. Aboriginal
activitists have declared <DATE>1988</DATE> a year of mourning.
   Muirhead, says in his report that governments at the state and
federal level should legislate to ensure that jail is used only as a
last resort for drunkenness.
   Justice Minister <PERSON>Michael Tate</PERSON> said the federal government
generally agrees with the thrust of the report.
   Muirhead refused comment beyond his recommendations, which
included:
   _ That drunkenness be abolished as an offense, accompanied by
programs to treat alcohol abuse and changes to the law to force
police to consider alternatives to jail for drunk people; that a
national task force be set up to examine social and health problems
among aborigines caused by alcohol abuse;
   _ That people found unconscious by police should be taken to a
hospital or a qualified health worker and not to jail. He encouraged
the recruitment of aboriginal police and prison officers, and
screening to prevent racist police and prison officers from being
retained.
   Federal statistics show that aboriginal life expectancy is 20
years less than for other Australians, while infant mortality among
aborigines is almost three times higher than among non-aborigines.
   Aborigines, according to government figures, also have a far
higher rate of diseases like trachoma while imprisonment rates for
aborigines are 16 times higher than the national average.
   Aboriginal unemployment is some six times the national average.
There are virtually no aborigines in professions such as law,
education and medicine despite <MONEY>millions of dollars</MONEY> each year in
federal funds for aborigines.

   A leading aboriginal artist and four

   Police in the aboriginal area of Arnhem Land in the <ORGANIZATION>Northern
Territory</ORGANIZATION> said the bodies of tribal elder <PERSON>Dick Ngueli Ngueli</PERSON>, also
known as <ORGANIZATION>Muru Muru</ORGANIZATION>, and his wife, daughter and two young grandsons
were found <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
   Police said relatives found the five victims lying face down in

   Police said a sixth victim, apparently <ORGANIZATION>Ngueli</ORGANIZATION>'s brother, was
also found dead, but gave no details.
   Superintendant <PERSON>Terry O'Brien</PERSON> of the <PERSON>Darwin</PERSON> police said the five
family members were killed with a shotgun and that used cartridges
were found near the bodies.
   Police said they plan to question tribal aborigines in the area
and were searching for <ORGANIZATION>Ngueli</ORGANIZATION>'s son-in-law, the <ORGANIZATION>Australian

   Ngueli, about 60 years old and a member of the Namok tribe, is
an internationally acclaimed bark painter whose works are on
display at the <ORGANIZATION>National Gallery</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Canberra</LOCATION>, the federal capital.
   The slayings followed media reports that aboriginal elders in
Arnhem Land had started ``singing to death'' _ a ritual death curse

   The reports said <PERSON>Galarrwuy Yunupingu</PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>Northern

   Police did not link the two incidents.

still common in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>.
   During a re-enactment <DATE>Jan. 26</DATE> of the arrival of the first fleet

<TEXT>
AUSTRALIAN aborigines yesterday threatened an avalanche of land claims,
after a High Court judgment had recognised the existence of land titles
pre-dating European settlement in <DATE>1788</DATE>.
The High Court ruled that the <PERSON>Miriam</PERSON> people of the <LOCATION>Murray Islands</LOCATION>, part of
the <LOCATION>Torres Strait</LOCATION> islands group off the north coast of mainland <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>,
had retained ownership of their land under common law.
The court restricted its judgment to the Murrays, and ruled that the concept
of 'native title' could exist only where such rights had not been
extinguished by the government.
However, aboriginal leaders said the judgment challenged the legal status of
the Australian government, which relies for its legitimacy on the claim that
the country was terra nullius when annexed by <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>.
This signifies that the land was effectively unoccupied, or occupied by
people who lacked a system of land tenure which would have inhibited
annexation and settlement.
The concept is regarded as a significant obstacle to land rights claims by
aborigines, who account for less than <MONEY>1 per cent</MONEY> of <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s 17m
population, but claim ownership of much of the country.
<PERSON>Mr Galarrwuy Yunupingu</PERSON>, chairman of the aboriginal <ORGANIZATION>Northern Lands Council</ORGANIZATION>,
said the federal government would face 'a barrage of litigation' unless it
moved quickly to negotiate a treaty with aborigines. 'The pathetic excuse of
terra nullius is now dead,' <PERSON>Mr Yunupingu</PERSON> said.
The court decision was 'a turning point in the history of this country, and
it kills off all the nonsense that Aboriginal people don't exist. It sets a
whole new precedent for aboriginal people,' he added.
<PERSON>Mr David Allen</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>Lands Council</ORGANIZATION>'s senior legal adviser, said 'significant
numbers' of aboriginal people would have a 'reasonable prospect' of
succeeding in land claims based on the decision.

<TEXT>
A native title bill, which sets up a system for deciding land claims by
<LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s Aborigines and <LOCATION>Torres Strait</LOCATION> islanders, was approved by the
<ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> yesterday.
The legislation, passed after a marathon parliamentary debate that began on
<DATE>Friday</DATE>, will come into effect on <DATE>January 1</DATE>. <PERSON>Mr Paul Keating</PERSON>, the Australian
prime minister who took a personal role in negotiating the bill with
Aboriginal leaders, described it as 'a turning point for all Australians'.
'This has been the longest continuing problem that <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> has faced for
200 years, recognising that indigenous people, that native people, had the
right to their own soil,' he said.
For two centuries <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s land management system has operated on the
principle that the land was uninhabited before European settlement. This
concept was overturned in a High Court ruling last year, which said native
title could exist where there had been 'close and continuing' association
with the land in question. However, the court added that land titles
acquired under accepted law since European settlement should not be
disturbed. The native title bill tries to marry these two rulings.
The bill has been highly controversial. Mining companies argue it will mean
that exploration becomes more costly and unpredictable. But the government
and Aboriginal groups say the number of successful land claims will be
small, benefiting perhaps 10 per cent of the Aboriginal population and
mainly involving vacant crown land.
Over one-seventh of <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s 1m square miles has already been set aside,
in one way or another, for the country's 265,000 aboriginal and <LOCATION>Torres
Strait</LOCATION> islander people.
The bill, debate over which had threatened to continue over the holiday
period, passed the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> 34-30 just after <TIME>midnight</TIME>. The lower <ORGANIZATION>House of
Representatives</ORGANIZATION>, where the government holds a majority, is scheduled to
approve the bill <TIME>this morning</TIME>.

   Families of four aborigines who died in
police custody today denounced a government report on the deaths
that criticized police but stopped short of recommending criminal
charges.
   The report, issued <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, found no evidence of foul play in
the four deaths but said they probably could have been avoided.
   Judge <PERSON>James Muirhead</PERSON> was ordered by the government of Prime
Minister <PERSON>Bob Hawke</PERSON> in <DATE>1987</DATE> to investigate 44 aboriginal deaths
nationwide since <DATE>1980</DATE>. Since the inquiry began, the number of deaths
has jumped to 107.
   Most of the offenders were arrested on minor charges such as
being drunk and disorderly.
   <PERSON>Alice Dixon</PERSON>, whose son, <PERSON>Kingsley</PERSON>, was found hanging in his cell
in <LOCATION>Adelaide</LOCATION> jail in <DATE>1987</DATE>, wept when she heard the report.
   ``I expected some retribution. They're murdering our people, our
boys, and they're getting away with it,'' she said. ``My son is
dead, other sons are dead and other mothers are grieving and this is
the result we are going to get.''
   <PERSON>Leila Murray</PERSON>, whose 21-year-old son <PERSON>Eddie</PERSON> was found hanged in
<DATE>1981</DATE>, said: ``I've never believed police.'' She said the finding her
son took his own life ``shatters my faith in white justice.''
   <PERSON>Muirhead</PERSON> said police fabricated evidence and withheld evidence
during the inquiry's investigation of <ORGANIZATION>Murray</ORGANIZATION>'s death.
   The judge concluded that proper custodial care and observance of
prison regulations could have prevented <PERSON>Dixon</PERSON>'s death, and that the
death by heart attack of <PERSON>Charles Sidney Michael</PERSON>, 31, in <DATE>1984</DATE> might
have been avoided.
   <PERSON>Muirhead</PERSON> said the fourth death, that of <PERSON>John Clarence Highfold</PERSON>,
37, at <LOCATION>Adelaide Jail</LOCATION> in <DATE>1983</DATE> was from natural causes.
   <PERSON>Muirhead</PERSON> didn't say when another report on more deaths would be
released.
   The <ORGANIZATION>National Aboriginal</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Islander Legal Service</ORGANIZATION>, which helped
pressure the government to investigate, criticized the inquiry.
   ``There is no message in there that says to police, `Stop if you
are killing people or if you all allowing aboriginals to die,'''
said service director <PERSON>Peter Coe</PERSON>.
   <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s indigenous aborigines number about 160,000, or about
<PERCENT>1 percent</PERCENT> of the 16 million population.

<TEXT>
THE AUSTRALIAN federal government has moved to dampen a heated national
debate over native land claims, granting some rights to aborigines over
mining leases but overriding claims to residential and pastoral land,
reports Reuter from <LOCATION>Canberra</LOCATION>.
Special minister of state <PERSON>Mr Frank Walker</PERSON>, leading negotiations on the
issue, said the cabinet decision should allay aborigines' concerns over
mining on native lands.
'The government has decided that we will give aboriginal people the same
rights as everyone else in the community, a right to negotiate and then if
that doesn't work a tribunal who'll arbitrate,' <PERSON>Mr Walker</PERSON> said in a radio
interview.
The issue has flared up in the past few months following land claims by
aborigines on the basis of a landmark <DATE>1992</DATE> high court ruling that their
native title to <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> had not been extinguished by white settlement in
<DATE>1788</DATE>. As a result aborigines theoretically can lay claim to vast parts of
<LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>, including prospective mining areas.
Mining industry leaders criticised the ruling and warned that it threatened
foreign investment.
The <ORGANIZATION>Australian Bankers' Association</ORGANIZATION> yesterday called for an end to
uncertainty over land title, saying its members were reluctant to lend to
businesses in areas subject to claims.
The compromise does not give aborigines a veto over mining on native lands
but the right to negotiate and refer disputes to a new tribunal, government
officials confirmed. But the government could still override a tribunal
decision if it was not regarded to be in the public interest, they added.
<PERSON>Mr Walker</PERSON> said that mining companies whose leases on native land expired
would also have to negotiate with aborigines to renew them.

   An Aborigine group today branded as
racist and ridiculous an official report saying their people
receive better care in prison than at home and do not see
incarceration as a deterrent.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Queensland Corrective Services Commission</ORGANIZATION> said in a report
<DATE>Tuesday</DATE> night to the state parliament that prison provided better
housing, education, medical and recreational facilities than most
aborigine prisoners experience outside.
   ``Tragically they do not see it as a deterrent,'' State Justice
Minister <PERSON>Glenn Milliner</PERSON> said.
   The report said aborigines and another group of <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>
natives, the <ORGANIZATION>Torres Strait Islanders</ORGANIZATION>, comprise <PERCENT>20 percent</PERCENT> of prison
inmates in <LOCATION>Queensland</LOCATION> state, but only <PERCENT>2.6 percent</PERCENT> of the population.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Queensland Aboriginal Legal Service</ORGANIZATION> called the findings
racist and ridiculous. The legal service's vice-chairman, <PERSON>Steve
Mam</PERSON>, said the vast majority of Aborigines and Islanders would be
``horrified'' if charged with a criminal offense, let alone sent to
prison.
   ``Most prisoners come out of jail having learned only about
violence and brutality,'' he said in a statement.
   Aborigines have been living in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> for at least 40,000
years and today number about 160,000, or less than <PERCENT>1 percent</PERCENT> of the
total population.
   <PERSON>Keith Hamburger</PERSON>, director general of the <ORGANIZATION>Corrective Services

crisis facing Aborigines and Islanders.
   ``There is no doubt that if the community as a whole would face
up to its responsibility to solve the awful social crisis facing
this much-maligned and disadvantaged, yet potentially talented
ethnic minority, there would be immense social benefits to our
society as a whole,'' he said.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Department of Aboriginal Affairs</ORGANIZATION> said Aborigines have a life
expectancy 20 years less than other Australians and an unemployment
rate six times the national average.

</HEADLINE>

   MELBOURNE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE AUSTRALIAN govern-ment yesterday proposed a sweeping package to protect
private mining and pastoral leases from aboriginal land claims. The 33-point
package includes legislation that would validate land titles issued between
<DATE>1975</DATE> and the <DATE>end of this month</DATE>.
The move came on the eve of the first anniversary of a high court decision
which, for the first time, acknowledged that indigenous people had occupied
<LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> before European settlement and still had rights to the land under
common law. Since that decision, aboriginal land councils have been
preparing to present claims in various courts around <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>.
One aboriginal tribe in the state of <LOCATION>New South Wales</LOCATION> recently lodged a writ
calling for the commonwealth and state governments to give up almost a
quarter of the state.
The government package also proposes to establish a formula under which
federal and state governments would share compensation payments to
aboriginal groups that might incur losses when leases are granted to private
holders. It also calls for the setting up of a special tribunal to deal with
aboriginal land claims.
Aboriginal land council officials have called the package a 'slimy and
useless piece of paper'. Meanwhile, the Aboriginal and <ORGANIZATION>Torres Strait
Islander Commission</ORGANIZATION> insists on veto power over land development, and on
mining royalties for development on land with native titles.
<PERSON>Mr Robert Tickner</PERSON>, the minister for aboriginal affairs, said the package was
on the table for discussion. 'It is not set in concrete,' he said.
The government has already attempted legislation to protect a large
development project in the <ORGANIZATION>Northern Territory</ORGANIZATION>. Last week it supported a
local government bill that would override native titles covering leases to a
ADollars 300m (Pounds 134m) lead-zinc mining project.
The <PERSON>McArthur</PERSON> river project, proposed to be developed by the Australian
mining group <ORGANIZATION>MIM</ORGANIZATION> and its Japanese partners, is expected to earn ADollars
200m a year in exports.
<LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s foreign debt as at the end of the <DATE>March quarter</DATE> stood at
ADollars 160.6bn (Pounds 72bn), a fall of 3.9 per cent from the figure at
the end of the previous <DATE>December quarter</DATE>.
This was the first quarterly fall in almost three years and was attributed
to debt repayments made by both the public and private sectors taking
advantage of lower interest rates.
The figure is, however, 7.9 per cent higher than at the end of the <DATE>March
quarter last year</DATE>.
Of the net foreign debt, the private sector accounted for 65 per cent or
ADollars 104.6m.
The ratio of the net foreign debt to <ORGANIZATION>GDP</ORGANIZATION> was 40.6 per cent, down <MONEY>1.9 per
cent</MONEY> at the end of the previous quarter.
A permanent reduction in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s foreign debt is unlikely in the
foreseeable future because of the continuing high current account deficit.

<HEAD>Aboriginal Leader Declares Provisional Government</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SYDNEY, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of Aborigines declared a
provisional government today, claiming they have been neglected for
decades by state and federal governments and see little prospect
for change.
   <PERSON>Michael Mansell</PERSON>, secretary of the <ORGANIZATION>Aboriginal Provisional
Government</ORGANIZATION>, said it would be autonomous, raise its own funds, have
its own passports and seek recognition by foreign governments.
   ``It is a political body set up to provide leadership to the
aspirations of Aboriginal people,'' the Aboriginal activist told a
news conference. ``All we are asking is the right to control
ourselves on our own land. We don't want to interfere with you
people, but just leave us alone as well.''
   It was not immediately clear what effect, if any, the
declaration would have. The <DATE>1981</DATE> census said <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> had about
160,000 Aborigines, comprising less than <PERCENT>1 percent</PERCENT> of the
population at the time.
   Estimates indicate the country had 300,000 or more Aborigines,
the indigenous people, when European settlers arrived.
   ``We would set ourselves a stage that in 20 to 30 years from
now, we would actually have enough land in this country so that
Aboriginal people could raise their own economy, legal system and
run their own government on it,'' <PERSON>Mansell</PERSON> said.
   The new government received an early rebuff when <ORGANIZATION>Federal
Aboriginal Affairs</ORGANIZATION> Minister <PERSON>Robert Tickner</PERSON> canceled a meeting set
for <DATE>Thursday</DATE> with <PERSON>Mansell</PERSON> and other <ORGANIZATION>Aboriginal</ORGANIZATION> representatives to
discuss the return of ancestoral Aboriginal skeletal remains from
overseas.
   A spokesman for <PERSON>Tickner</PERSON> said the minister would not meet any
representatives of a provisional Aboriginal government.
   <PERSON>Mansell</PERSON> said the provisional government would encourage local
Aboriginal communities to take back what they consider their land
by squatting on it and would provide them with financial and
``people'' support to resist police and government attempts to
remove them.
   However, <PERSON>Mansell</PERSON> said the provisional government was purely a
political body and would not compete with any government bodies
that provide services to Aboriginal people.
   He said the provisional government's main aims were obtaining
land rights, gaining control over Aboriginal culture and heritage,
and pursuing the return of the Aboriginal skeletal remains from
overseas.
   <PERSON>Mansell</PERSON> denied the new government would cause greater division
between Aborigines and whites.
   ``There will always be divisions in this country because there
are two distinct peoples and there is nothing wrong with being
different,'' he said. ``The only thing that's wrong with people
being different is where one group imposes its will upon another.''
   Funding for the new government would be provided by a system of
rent payments, the sale of Aboriginal passports and donations.
   Under the rent-payment system, already in operation in <LOCATION>Victoria</LOCATION>
state, sympathetic whites who believe in Aboriginal sovereignty
over the continent pay nominal rent to the black community.

<TEXT>
INVESTORS in the Australian mining, pastoral and timber industries were
yesterday thrown into confusion by a deadlock in talks between federal and
state governments on how to deal with aboriginal land claims.
And while the officials grappled with a definition of 'native land title'
the Australian High Court has been flooded with aboriginal claims covering
vast tracts of land, including the whole of the <LOCATION>Canberra</LOCATION> region. Large areas
in <LOCATION>New South Wales</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Victoria</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Queensland</LOCATION> are also being claimed.
The meeting between <PERSON>Mr Paul Keating</PERSON>, prime minister, and state premiers was
to have drawn up a national procedure to deal with aboriginal land claims
triggered by the so-called Mabo decision handed down by the High Court a
year ago. The court recognised that native titles existed before European
occupation of <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>.
The decision abolished the accepted doctrine that <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> was no one's
land when the Europeans arrived. As a result of the decision, aboriginal
groups able to demonstrate a continuing link with an area of land are now
able to claim native titles.
<PERSON>Mr Keating</PERSON>'s Labor government has accepted the principle of native titles,
and has tried to get agreement from state governments to establish tribunals
to hear and resolve claims to them. And in a move to protect mining and
business leases that might be covered by aboriginal claims, <PERSON>Mr Keating</PERSON> has
proposed to introduce legislation validating leases granted between <DATE>1975</DATE> and
the time of the Mabo decision in <DATE>1992</DATE>. He has also proposed compensation be
paid to Aborigines suffering losses from such leases.
While the state governments agreed to legislate and validate leases, two of
the most resource-rich states, <PERSON>Victoria</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Western Australia</LOCATION>, have rejected
the Mabo decision, arguing that state parliaments could legislate to
extinguish native titles.
<PERSON>Mr Keating</PERSON> has now threatened to introduce federal legislation to force
state governments to come into line.

aborigine land claim
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<LOCATION>AUSTRALIA</LOCATION>'S federal government, under pressure from miners and state
governments, yesterday gave its support to a <LOCATION>Queensland</LOCATION> aluminium and
bauxite project that promises 2,000 jobs but is under threat from an
aboriginal land claim.
<PERSON>Mr Michael Lavarch</PERSON>, the attorney general, said legislation protecting
<ORGANIZATION>Comalco</ORGANIZATION>'s Weipa project, the first working mine to be hit by a native title
claim, may be introduced in <DATE>September</DATE>. 'The mining leases which <ORGANIZATION>Comalco</ORGANIZATION> hold
will be validated,' he said in a radio interview.
The Weipa bauxite mine leases are included in a claim by the aboriginal Wik
people for more than 35,000 sq km of land on the western side of <LOCATION>Cape York</LOCATION>
peninsula.
A landmark <DATE>1992</DATE> high court case, known as the Mabo case after one of the
aboriginal litigants, established aboriginal native title. It ruled that
where aborigines could prove a continuing relationship with their
traditional lands, their native title might not have been extinguished by
white settlement.
<ORGANIZATION>Comalco</ORGANIZATION>, 67 per cent owned by <ORGANIZATION>CRA</ORGANIZATION>, had said the aboriginal claim would scare
off lenders from a planned ADollars 1.83bn (Pounds 830m) expansion of its
smelter and electricity generating operations at the port of <LOCATION>Gladstone</LOCATION>.
It declined to comment on <PERSON>Mr Lavarch</PERSON>'s remarks. But <PERSON>Mr Lauchlan McIntosh</PERSON>,
executive director of the <ORGANIZATION>Australian Mining Industry Council</ORGANIZATION>, praised the
move. '<PERSON>Mr Lavarch</PERSON> has seen the value of the project to <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>,' he said.

FT  14 DEC 93 / Land bill leaves Australians unclear where they stand: An
Aborigine rights law that pleases few
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<PERSON>Noel Pearson</PERSON>, a 28-year-old lawyer, tells a group of Australian senators why
he, and fellow Aborigines, negotiated a milestone land rights deal with the
government: 'It was a salvage exercise - a desperate salvage exercise.'
<PERSON>Michael Mansell</PERSON>, speaking for the more radical <ORGANIZATION>Aboriginal Alliance
Committee</ORGANIZATION>, tells the senators that the proposed legislation which has come
out of those negotiations and could be passed into law this week, would do
little to help his people. Worse, it could impede their rights in some
areas.
Both men are presenting their views in a <LOCATION>Canberra</LOCATION> committee room which, with
its air-conditioning and wood-panelling, is far from the scorched red earth
at the centre of this fight. There, everyone agrees, Aborigine communities
with rudimentary education and limited access to information, have little
hope of grasping the complex legal tussle that is going on.
'I can't say that half of Aborigines have any understanding of this bill,'
says <PERSON>Mr Mansell</PERSON>.
The Australian government's native title bill is also perplexing the
business community. Lawyers for the nation's mining and resource-based
companies have spent weeks scouring the wording and wondering whether money
poured into project development would now be secure from lengthy legal
battles.
'Let's put it like this. The lawyers haven't found any problems - yet,' says
one mining executive, when asked about the likely go-ahead for a stalled
multi-million-dollar deal. Summing up the general concern, <PERSON>Mr John Prescott</PERSON>,
head of <ORGANIZATION>BHP</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s largest industrial company, has likened the
legislation to 'reading porridge'.
For all the confusion, its significance is difficult to understate. In
simple economic terms, land-related industries are crucial to the nation's
prosperity. Mining and agriculture, for example, account for about 7.5 per
cent of gross domestic product and provide more than 60 per cent of
merchandise exports.
The native title bill represents an attempt by today's <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> to come to
terms with a less than glorious aspect of its past. When European settlers
first arrived in <LOCATION>Botany Bay</LOCATION> in the <DATE>late 18th century</DATE>, they worked on the
premise that land was uninhabited. This was despite an evident indigenous
population who were simply 'dispossessed'. This was compounded by decades of
shoddy treatment meted out to the Aboriginal community. A law prohibiting
racial discrimination came into force only in <DATE>1975</DATE>.
Unemployment is high among indigenous people and social conditions are poor.
Tensions lurk close to the surface. The death recently of <PERSON>Daniel Yock</PERSON>, a
young Aborigine dancer who had been arrested in a <LOCATION>Brisbane</LOCATION> street brawl,
prompted riotous demonstrations, allegations of police brutality, and a
public inquiry.
The immediate catalyst for some form of native title legislation has been
legal rather than moral, however. Last year, the Australian high court
decreed that native title could exist where Aborigines had maintained a
close and continuing relationship with the land, although it added that land
titles acquired under accepted law since European settlement should not be
disturbed. The bill is an attempt to marry these two pronouncements.
In essence it provides for a system of 'validating' existing land titles.
Where this happened, and except in the case of mining leases, native title
claims would be extinguished. In the case of mining leases, native title
would be allowed to stand alongside an existing lease, then take over when
that lease expired.
However, where a genuine native title claim was extinguished, compensation
would be paid by state or federal government. A system of tribunals would be
set up to handle claims and adjudicate on compensation matters. Native title
holders or claimants would have negotiating rights over the land in question
but no veto right.
The compromise nature of the legislation means that its likely practical
implications please no one. On the Aborigine side, it is estimated that no
more than 10 per cent of the indigenous population would have any chance of
successfully asserting native title claims. In most cases, victorious claims
would be levelled against vacant Crown land, the largest amounts of which
lie in western <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>.
This makes all important the federal government's promise of a land fund to
help the majority of Aborigines who did not gain from the bill. 'The only
way my people in <LOCATION>Cape York</LOCATION> are going to benefit is via the land fund,' says
<PERSON>Mr Pearson</PERSON>, for example. But the dollar amount has yet to be spelt out.
Moreover, as more radical voices such as <PERSON>Mr Mansell</PERSON>'s point out, even where
Aborigines do establish native title they would not get back everything
which the land holds. Mineral rights, for instance, would remain with the
Crown.
While the mining and pastoral industries know that government would pick up
compensation costs, this would not prevent long hearings to establish native
title rights. In theory, the private sector should be no more than a
bystander in this process; in practice, it would probably incur legal and
other costs.
Meanwhile, the ability of native title claimants or holders to negotiate
over developments may lead to unwanted delays. Such uncertainties - and
there are others - could affect the availability and cost of project
finance, it is argued. The nation's biggest mining companies warned this
month that the need to establish the native title position before beginning
exploration would divert the industry's investment abroad. 'You'll see the
exploration dollar vote with its feet,' says one executive.
And for the general public, there is the big unanswered question of how much
the compensation claims would cost, but the government refuses to be drawn.
One <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> official has hinted that higher taxes may be down the road.
Opposition leaders have warned that the sums, including the land fund, could
be considerable; the government says it is impossible to assess, although it
expects that the number of successful native title claims would be limited.
Judging by opinion polls, this leaves the public as wary as everyone else
about the legislation's merits.

FT  03 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Eddie Mabo's legacy of fear for
Australian miners - A judgment named after an obscure aborigine is
threatening the industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN MINING circles, the best known name in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> is not <PERSON>Paul Keating</PERSON>, the
prime minister, but <PERSON>Eddie Mabo</PERSON>, an obscure aboriginal activist who lived all
his life on an isolated island off the tropical north coast. <PERSON>Mr Mabo</PERSON>, who
died last year, gave his name to a historic judgment by <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s High
Court which many mining companies claim is a threat to the future of the
resources industry.
Both the Labor government and the conservative opposition have played down
the implications of the Mabo case, partly in order to avoid a damaging row
with aboriginal activists. However, <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s approaching federal election
has focussed attention on the multitude of questions raised by the case that
will face whichever is in government after polling day, <DATE>March 13</DATE>.
The uncertainty flows from a High Court ruling that <PERSON>Mr Mabo</PERSON>'s Meriam
aboriginal group owns <LOCATION>Murray Island</LOCATION>, which lies in the <LOCATION>Torres Strait</LOCATION> between
<LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New Guinea</LOCATION>. The significance of this is the court's
recognition that a form of 'native title' may exist where ownership of land
has not been explicitly transferred to private hands - for example, by
freehold sale.
The judgment was greeted with jubilation by aboriginal activists because it
extinguishes the constitutional doctrine that <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> was terra nullius,
or unoccupied, when European settlement began in <DATE>1788</DATE>.
In the long-term, the judgment will help to legitimise aboriginal claims
that <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s indigenous inhabitants were disposessed by British settlers
and may increase pressure on the government to negotiate a treaty. More
immediately, however, it has prompted claims from aborigines and mining
groups alike that other areas, many of which include mines or mining
prospects, may be open to similar land claims.
Already, aboriginal groups have indicated that ownership claims will be made
on much of the Kimberleys region of <LOCATION>Western Australia</LOCATION> and the Nabalco
bauxite mine at <ORGANIZATION>Gove</ORGANIZATION> in the <ORGANIZATION>Northern Territory</ORGANIZATION>. Other claims have been
discussed, though not yet filed, on <ORGANIZATION>MIM Holdings</ORGANIZATION>' <LOCATION>McArthur River</LOCATION>
lead/zinc/silver project in the territory and most of central <LOCATION>Brisbane</LOCATION>, the
state capital of <LOCATION>Queensland</LOCATION>. More claims are likely according to <PERSON>Mr Mick
Dodson</PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION>Northern Land Council</ORGANIZATION>, an aboriginal advisory group,
who says 'blanket land claims' across <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> are likely to prove a 'gold
mine' for aborigines.
The ruling was the last straw for many people in the mining industry, which
was already concerned about the federal government's decision to block a
gold project at Coronation Hill because of Aboriginal religious objections.
Sir <PERSON>Arvi Parbo</PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Western Mining Corporation</ORGANIZATION>, says the ruling
raises doubts about the legality of existing mines and warns that new
projects may be delayed or cancelled.
Ironically, the federal government has made determined efforts over the last
year to overcome unease about the Coronation Hill decision by establishing a
'fast tracking' approval mechanism for major projects. The accelerated
approval procedure is likely to be undermined, however, if projects are made
the subject of land claims relying on the precedent of the Mabo decision.
<ORGANIZATION>MIM</ORGANIZATION>, for example, received approval within nine months for the ADollars 250m
(Pounds 120m) <LOCATION>McArthur River</LOCATION> project. It believes it holds legal title to
the area and intends to press on with development.
It is not clear, however, how the title granted under existing legislation
would be affected if the <ORGANIZATION>Northern Land Council</ORGANIZATION> went ahead with its threat to
file a land claim. This is because the High Court judgment says that native
title exists only where aboriginal groups can prove continuous occupation or
close association with the land being claimed. In addition, the extent of
the native title would depend on the traditional rights of the aborigines
concerned, which might vary from full ownership to hunting or fishing
rights. A further complication is that native title is likely to have been
extinguished by mining titles issued before <DATE>1975</DATE>, most of which effectively
transferred the land to private ownership. However, most mining titles
issued since <DATE>1975</DATE> would not extinguish native title because of the
provisions of the federal Racial Discrimination Act, which prevents the
abolition of land claim rights without compensation.
<PERSON>Mr Hugh Morgan</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>WMC</ORGANIZATION>'s managing director, has called on the federal
government to ease the problem by repealing the Race Discrimination Act.
However, such a step is unlikely because it would breach <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s
international treaty obligations.
An alternative approach would be for mining companies to reach specific
agreements with local aboriginal groups under which they would trade
compensation for a binding agreement that no land claim would be made.
<LOCATION>Zapopan</LOCATION>, a small mining company, recently reached such an agreement with the
Jawoyn aborigines which will allow the development of a gold mine at <ORGANIZATION>Mount
Todd</ORGANIZATION>, about 300 km (180 miles) south of <LOCATION>Darwin</LOCATION>. Other mining groups say,
however, that this strategy is fraught with danger because of the fragmented
nature of aboriginal society.
'It is impossible to know whether the people signing have the authority to
sign on behalf of all the groups which may have an association with the
area,' says an executive involved in land claims negotiations.
Faced with this uncertainty both the government and the Liberal/National
Party coalition have promised consultations with aboriginal and mining
groups to try to find an agreed solution. The coalition has said it would
legislate 'if necessary', but has not explained how the legislation would
work. Nor has it supported threats by the conservative <ORGANIZATION>Northern Territory</ORGANIZATION>
government to block land claims by legislation.
<PERSON>Mr Gregory McIntyre</PERSON>, the <LOCATION>Perth</LOCATION> lawyer who represented <PERSON>Mr Mabo</PERSON>, says it may
be possible to resolve some of the claims by negotiation, or by legislation
that clarifies aboriginal rights. But the complexity of the judgment means
that many cases will have to be decided by the courts, prolonging the
uncertainty for miners and aborigines alike.
'The only alternative would be for the <ORGANIZATION>High Court</ORGANIZATION> to rule in the next test
case that mining rights extinguish native title (in all cases),' <PERSON>Mr McIntyre</PERSON>
says. 'That would put an ened to all the uncertainty. But if the court rules
favourably for the Aboriginal people then there would be a drawn out process
of claims being made.'

<TEXT>
MR <PERSON>Paul Keating</PERSON>, Australian prime minister, yesterday called on the nation
to use high court recognition of Aborigines' land rights as 'an opportunity
to transcend the history of dispossession' for <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s indigenous
people.
In a rare televised address to the country, <PERSON>Mr Keating</PERSON> - who has taken a
large personal role in negotiations between the government and Aborigine
leaders over the highly-contentious native title issue - said that
Australians could not ignore the matter, either 'legally or morally'.
However, he provided no advance details of the government's bill on
Aboriginal land rights, which is due to be introduced into parliament later
this week, possibly today.
The proposed legislation follows a High Court ruling <DATE>last year</DATE>, which did
away with the notion that <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> was uninhabited before European
settlement and said native title could exist where there had been 'close and
continuing' association with the land.
Despite <PERSON>Mr Keating</PERSON>'s claims that there needed to be a national standard for
land rights determination, the recalcitrant Western Australian government
maintained its opposition to the federal package yesterday. Western
<LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> is the area most likely to be affected by the land rights
legislation. In theory, about 40 per cent of the state could be subject to
native title claims.
<PERSON>Mr Richard Court</PERSON>, the <LOCATION>Western Australia</LOCATION>'s premier, threatened to speed the
passage of his own state's rival land rights legislation if the commonwealth
denied full public and parliamentary debate on the federal legislation.
The <LOCATION>Western Australia</LOCATION> government has already published a bill which would
extinguish native title, but recognise in law the rights to 'traditional
usage' of the land by Aboriginal people. Mr Court has been emphatic that the
states should retain control of land management, and should not be
constrained by any commonwealth measures.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR <PERSON>Paul Keating</PERSON>, the Australian prime minister, is to present draft
legislation to his cabinet on <DATE>Monday</DATE> setting out a system for deciding land
claims lodged by Aborigine groups.
The legislation could then be delivered to parliament in a matter of weeks.
In <LOCATION>Canberra</LOCATION> yesterday, <PERSON>Mr Keating</PERSON> said the proposed legislation would allow
Aborigine groups to choose either federal or state jurisdictions, recognised
by the <ORGANIZATION>Commonwealth</ORGANIZATION>, for the hearing of native title claims.
Some states had argued that all native title decisions should lie in their
hands. However, <PERSON>Mr Keating</PERSON> added that decisions over the economic use of
native title land would remain exclusively with Commonwealth-approved state
tribunals.
'Existing grants of interest will be validated and be secure, and the states
and territories will continue to have the capacity to manage land if they
meet the standards of the Commonwealth bill,' he said.
<PERSON>Mr Keating</PERSON> indicated that native title could, under the government's
legislation, co-exist with some existing leasehold titles, but he did not
detail which leases would come under this category. Aborigine groups have
been pushing to extend an earlier proposal that mining leases should be the
only significant class of leases not to extinguish native title. They have

tourism or forestry leases, and revive once these expired.
The issue of Aborigine land rights has been contentious for the past 18

This prompted an outcry from the mining industry, generated concerns among

FT  26 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Aboriginal claim may threaten
mine project

<TEXT>
MIM HOLDINGS, the Australian resources group, is considering a potential
claim by an aboriginal group for ownership of the site of its <LOCATION>McArthur River</LOCATION>
lead/zinc/silver project in the <ORGANIZATION>Northern Territory</ORGANIZATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>MIM</ORGANIZATION> has received a letter from the <ORGANIZATION>Northern Land Council</ORGANIZATION>, an aboriginal
advisory group, seeking consultations about the project on behalf of
aborigines in the territory and in northern <LOCATION>Queensland</LOCATION>. This follows
suggestions by the council that a legal claim for ownership of the land
might be filed unless <ORGANIZATION>MIM</ORGANIZATION> agreed to provide jobs and compensation to
aborigines claiming connection with the area.
<ORGANIZATION>MIM</ORGANIZATION> and a group of Japanese joint venturers received permission to develop
the mine last year after complying with the environmental and planning
regulations of the federal and territorial governments.
However, the status of some mining rights has been thrown into doubt by a
High Court decision last year that overthrew the legal doctrine that
<LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> was terra nullius, or unoccupied, when European settlement began
in <DATE>1788</DATE>. The decision created a form of 'native title' applying to
government-owned land where aboriginal groups can prove uninterrupted
occupation or a continuous close relationship.
A legal claim for ownership of <LOCATION>McArthur River</LOCATION> could delay development of the
mine, which is 70 per cent owned by <ORGANIZATION>MIM</ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION>Nippon Mining and Metals</ORGANIZATION> owns 15
per cent, and <ORGANIZATION>Mitsui</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Mitsubishi Materials</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Marubeni</ORGANIZATION> 5 per cent each.
The land council's action angered the territory's government, which claimed
that aboriginal and environmental opposition to mining has reduced
investment proposals.
<PERSON>Mr Shane Stone</PERSON>, mines and energy minister, said the threat of a land claim
against <LOCATION>McArthur River</LOCATION> was 'beyond the pale'. He said the project was 'too
important to become another Coronation Hill' - a gold project in the
<ORGANIZATION>Northern Territory</ORGANIZATION> that was blocked in <DATE>1991</DATE> after the federal government
accepted aboriginal claims that the site was sacred.
The territory government did not make clear how it planned to overcome the
provisions of federal race discrimination legislation.
The federal Labor government and the conservative opposition have said that
land claims should be resolved by negotiation.

<TEXT>
   Queen <PERSON>Elizabeth II</PERSON> presided <DATE>Monday</DATE> at
the opening of <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s new <ORGANIZATION>Parliament House</ORGANIZATION>, which took nearly
<MONEY>$1 billion</MONEY> and eight years to build. About 2,000 aborigines
protested outside.
   The British queen called the building a crowning expression of
Australian faith in parliamentary democracy and noted that it
replaces a provisional Parliament building opened 61 years earlier
by her father, <PERSON>King George VI</PERSON>.
   Aboriginal activists and sympathizers began gathering at dawn to
protest the proceedings and their number grew to about 2,000 by the
time the queen arrived.
   Chants of ``Shame, shame, shame!'' and ``We want land rights
now!'' virtually drowned out the national anthem ``Advance
<LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> Fair'' during welcoming ceremonies attended by Prime
Minister <PERSON>Bob Hawke</PERSON> and other dignitaries.
   <PERSON>Robyn Dass</PERSON>, an aboriginal activist, said the new building is on
a site sacred to the aborigines.
   Police said cables of the outdoor public address system were cut
before the queen arrived but were restored about 10 minutes into
the ceremony.
   The opening of <ORGANIZATION>Parliament House</ORGANIZATION> is a highlight of year-long
celebrations of the 200th anniversary of the European settlement of
<LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>.
   At a final cost of <MONEY>$1.1 billion</MONEY> (<MONEY>$836 million</MONEY> <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>), it also is
the nation's most expensive building. There is enough concrete in
it to build 25 replicas of <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION>'s landmark <ORGANIZATION>Opera House</ORGANIZATION>.
   Opening it was <PERSON>Elizabeth</PERSON>'s last official function of a
three-week tour that was her 11th visit to the country as queen.
   Huge crowds welcomed her and her husband, <LOCATION>Prince Philip</LOCATION>. The
aborigines turned their backs on the royal couple and sat down en
masse.
   During the queen's inspection of an honor guard, a 3-year-old
aboriginal girl left the crowd and thrust a bouquet of flowers into
her hands.
   She accepted the flowers, wrapped in aboriginal ribbons of
black, red and gold, but did not speak to the girl, <PERSON>Zena Wickes</PERSON>.
   In dedicating the bulding, the queen said: ``I rather doubt that
the founding fathers of the Australian federation could have
foreseen that their work would be crowned by such a confident
expression of <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s faith in parliamentary democracy.''
   Hawke paid tribute to <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s indigenous people in his
speech, noting that they had lived in the area for 21,000 years.
The aboriginal word ``canberra'' means meeting place.
   The new <ORGANIZATION>Parliament House</ORGANIZATION> has 4,500 rooms, public galleries
seating 1,000 people, kitchens capable of producing 8,000 meals a
day and parking space for more than 2,000 vehicles.
   The old building, half a mile away, is to become a museum.

FT  07 OCT 94 / Aborigines turn to land fund for redress: The ink had barely
dried on the Native Title act when problems started surfacing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Less than a year since <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> made a kind of peace with its indigenous
population, the question of Aboriginal rights threatens to become
politically contentious again.
In <DATE>December last year</DATE>, the federal parliament passed a law allowing
Aborigines and <LOCATION>Torres Strait</LOCATION> islanders to assert native title claims over
the country's large land mass. If claims were valid and land had since been
put to other uses, compensation would be paid. This was the first formal
acknowledgment - other than a <DATE>1992</DATE> High Court ruling - that the country was
inhabited before European settlement.
But, with the implementation of that package caught in a tussle between
federal and state authorities, the focus is turning to a ADollars 1.5bn
(Pounds 700m) land fund, designed to help those indigenous people who have
little chance of benefiting from the <ORGANIZATION>Native Title</ORGANIZATION> act itself.
In theory, the land fund is a good idea. The problem with last <DATE>December</DATE>'s
law was that it required an indigenous community to demonstrate a 'close and
continuing' association with the land it was claiming. Many Aborigines,
however, have moved from their original homelands.
To some extent, this drift has been voluntary. But it has also been due in
part to the behaviour of white settlers. Aboriginal leaders estimate that no
more than 10 per cent of their people have any chance of benefiting directly
from the new law.
So, in the lengthy negotiations leading up to Native Title Act's passage,
they wrung a promise from the government that a fund would be set up to
acquire land on behalf of the remaining 90 per <MONEY>cent</MONEY> - a concession some saw
as of more practical significance than the main legislation. The government
published details earlier this year, and the necessary legislation is
working its way through parliament in <LOCATION>Canberra</LOCATION>.
The problem is that interested parties on all sides have reservations about
the scheme's design. Some Aboriginal representatives say the fund is too
small to be viable, and that the administrative framework is offensively
paternalistic.
Opposition politicians, by contrast, have argued the money could be better
spent on Aborginal health and housing. They have offered a raft of
amendments, saying they will only support the legislation if these are
accepted. It took the government only hours to reject this proposition.
But perhaps the most critical views, from a political standpoint, are those
of the minor parties who hold the balance of power in the senate,
parliament's upper house, through which any legislation must pass. Already,
the two Green party senators, who hail from <LOCATION>Western Australia</LOCATION> and hence have
an important Aboriginal constituency, have expressed serious concerns about
the fund's parameters.
'The question is whether this becomes yet another <ORGANIZATION>Native Title</ORGANIZATION> debate,' said
one official at the <ORGANIZATION>Aboriginal</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Torres Strait Islanders Commission</ORGANIZATION>
(<ORGANIZATION>ATSIC</ORGANIZATION>), which represents Aboriginal interests. He was referring to the
mammoth parliamentary effort which was needed to ensure the original bill's
passage. 'The Greens are playing the same role - trying to extract more
(from the federal government),' he added.
The objectors have a point. The fund is less generous than it originally
appeared. The ADollars 1.5bn figure mentioned in the last budget is made up
of a ADollars 200m contribution from federal coffers in <DATE>1994/5</DATE>, and ADollars
121m a year for the next nine years.
The bulk of this money, moreover, will be invested to ensure the fund is
self-sustaining after the first decade. Only ADollars 45m out of each annual
payment will go to acquire land, or to fund land management. Moreover, funds
<ORGANIZATION>ATSIC</ORGANIZATION> already devotes to this purpose from its own budget - ADollars 21m a
year - will be incorporated in the ADollars 45m figure.
ATSIC has taken the view that any increase is better than none, and that,
having done its best in negotiations, it will support the bill as it stands.
But it is not overjoyed. As <PERSON>David Ross</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>ATSIC</ORGANIZATION> commissioner, has put it: 'I
think the fund is adequate . . . I am certainly not saying that it is
over-generous.'
Other Aboriginal representatives are more critical. <PERSON>Mr Aden Ridgeway</PERSON>,
director of the <ORGANIZATION>New South Wales Aboriginal Land Council</ORGANIZATION>, who represents the
interests of indigenous people in that state, has pointed out that the
annual funding works out at ADollars 5.5m per state or territory, and that
this low level will force the land fund to spread its money around
second-grade properties.
'You will not get really viable land when you do not have much money to
spend,' he warned. 'You will end up with land in the low rainfall area which
obviously will not be productive and viable.'
Equally thorny are the questions of how land purchases will be organised and
prioritised. The legislation is thin on operational details, but it does
provide for the formation of a new body, the <ORGANIZATION>Indigenous Land Corporation</ORGANIZATION>, to
handle purchases and management. After some compromise, the <ORGANIZATION>ILC</ORGANIZATION>'s
prospective board has been extended to seven, and the chairperson plus at
least four other directors must be Aborigines or <ORGANIZATION>Torres Strait Islanders</ORGANIZATION>.
Even so, the fact that these appointments are to be made by a federal
minister and that the federal finance minister has ultimate power over the
land fund's investment touches a nerve. It smacks, in some eyes, of
condescension, even racism.
Moreover, in the first three years, the ADollars 45m will be divided between
<ORGANIZATION>ATSIC</ORGANIZATION> and the ILC, with the latter taking on full responsibility after this
interim period. Sorting out how these bodies weigh up the mass of
applications which will almost certainly be presented,and perform
complementary investment roles, is no easy task. As one <ORGANIZATION>ATSIC</ORGANIZATION> adminstrator
points out, it is not a question of maximising financial returns. Outback
land of spiritual significance, for example, might have to be weighed
against the desire of an urban group to build a local community centre.
There is a fair amount of goodwill surrounding the land fund discussions.
There is also considerable reluctance to repeat the trauma of the main
legislation. Nevertheless, as <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> found last year, the road to
reconciliation is long and bumpy.

FT  17 NOV 93 / Keating to push land rights bill: Legislation sparks bitter
debate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE KEATING government yesterday introduced its native land rights bill into
the Australian parliament, and indicated that it hopes to have the
contentious and complex legislation on the statute book by <DATE>Christmas</DATE>.
<PERSON>Mr Kim Beazley</PERSON>, leader of the government's business in the <ORGANIZATION>House of
Representatives</ORGANIZATION>, declined to rule out use of a parliamentary guillotine,
saying that speedy passage was desirable to ensure certainty. <PERSON>Mr Paul
Keating</PERSON>, the prime minister, also said that 'most aspects of the bill' would
come into force by <DATE>January 1</DATE>, provided parliament approved the package.
However, any forcing of the pace is being resisted by the opposition
parties, and by the West Australian government, which is vehemently opposed
to the federal package and has introduced rival land rights legislation.
The legislation aims to protect native title where Aborigines can show a
continuous link to traditional lands. Aborigines will be empowered to
negotiate on land use but will not have the right to veto development.
Native title tribunals are to be set up to rule on land claims and set
compensation. Mining leases will be validated, but native title rights can
be exercised after a grant expires.
The issue has sparked a bitter debate in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>, with business, mining
and conservative political leaders predicting dire economic consequences if
Aborigines gained rights to land taken from them by white settlers.
The bill also establishes a <ORGANIZATION>National Aboriginal</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Torres Strait Islander
Land Fund</ORGANIZATION>, which will help dispossessed Aborigines acquire and maintain
land.
<PERSON>Mr Keating</PERSON> gave no figures yesterday on the size of this fund, or on the
expected cost of compensation for the ending of native title claims. An
explanatory memorandum attached to the bill said that about ADollars 6m
(Pounds 2.6m) had been set aside to fund its initial implementation, but
added that it was impossible to identify any direct liability for
compensation that the <ORGANIZATION>Commonwealth</ORGANIZATION> might have to bear, although the sums
could be 'considerable'.
Both the opposition, which has yet to formulate a response to the land
rights issue, and the minority parties who hold the balance of power in the
<ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>, were <TIME>last night</TIME> studying details of the bill before declaring their
positions.

<TEXT>
   As <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> begins its bicentennial year amid protests by some of its Aborigine population, one proposal that has cropped up has been for a treaty or compact between the government and its Aboriginal citizens that would recognize the Aborigines' prior ownership of the land. 
Such a treaty, however, is inherently divisive and undoubtedly would create more problems than it would solve. 
In particular, it would perpetuate differences and increase resentment at a time when we should be seeking to weld a strong nation out of <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s many ethnic and cultural components. 

   The current national ferment about Aborigines and other minority groups seems to derive from two sources: first, general Australian ignorance about history and the rest of the world; second, an exaggerated paternalism that wishes to ensure that every possible contingency is tied into some piece of legislation. 
Indeed, there is a cultural tendency in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> to believe that nothing comparable has ever happened anywhere else. 
Yet the history of the world is full of incidents that compare with <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s treatment of Aborigines, and the landing of the British on this soil 200 years ago this <DATE>Jan. 18</DATE> and their subsequent actions were in accord with international law and the accepted attitudes and practices of the time. 
Indeed, in the context of the times, Capt. <PERSON>Arthur Phillip</PERSON>'s treatment of the Aborigines around the <LOCATION>Botany Bay</LOCATION> area was remarkable for its leniency. 

   Apart from the dubious assumption that Aborigines can be addressed en masse -- anyone who understands Aborigines knows that they have a host of tribal and other associations that would have to be dealt with -- a treaty between the government and the Aborigines would be offensive and totally irrelevant to the millions of Australians whose families played no part in the European settlement. 
I am not sure, for example, that Australians of Chinese, Greek, Italian, Vietnamese or dozens of other ethnic backgrounds would appreciate being included in the mass apology of a treaty. 
Perhaps the government will then counter with a treaty between the Aborigines and only those Australians who feel guilty. 

   The point is that since <DATE>1967</DATE> we Aborigines have all been full Australians under the constitution, and that is the way we should be regarded. 
To single out Aborigines as a race apart by means of a treaty or compact is reminiscent of <LOCATION>Fiji</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION> or any other country where measures have been taken to protect permanently the interests of one particular group. 
The result is always smoldering resentment. 

   Of course there is much that can be done to help Aborigines improve their lot. 
Some Aboriginal values, attitudes and physical locations stand in the way of their success in the world; the Pintupi people on the Northern Territory/Western Australian border, for example, suffer from their total isolation from the education that might help raise their standard of living. 
Other Aboriginal groups lack English skills or are hurt by plain poverty. 
Any responsible government will take steps to relieve distress and assist people to play their full part in the affairs of the nation. 
The way to do that, however, is to treat everyone as a full Australian -- not separating them into ethnic and racial categories. 
We should be building on what we have in common, not emphasizing our differences. 

   An example of a program that has backfired is the Land Rights Act in the <ORGANIZATION>Northern Territory</ORGANIZATION>, designed to improve relations between Aborigines and the rest of the community. 
This woolly-minded paternalism has much to answer for. 
Land is granted to appease the non-Aborigine conscience in the large cities, but Aborigines are not allowed to use it freely because paternalists do not think the black man is sufficiently mature to behave responsibly. 
For example, Aborigines are prohibited from selling, leasing or trading their land -- thus they are shut out from most of the activities that would make their land an economic asset. 

   On top of this, some Aborigines have used Land Rights as a lever in their effort to carve out an Aborigine nation -- something that has never existed. 
Land Rights and a treaty simply cannot create a nation out of a people who constitute but <PERCENT>1%</PERCENT> of <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s population and are scattered about its vast continent. 
From the other side, some non-Aborigines have used the record of Land Rights to suggest that avarice, bad faith and gullibility are the hallmarks of agreements with the Aborigines and their advisers. 
In the eyes of many Australians, therefore, as Aborigines have won more land they have lost much good will. 
It would be a tragedy were this source of racial disharmony to be enshrined and perpetuated by any sort of treaty. 

   Most likely, such a treaty would be used as the thin edge of the wedge to push for the forming of an Aboriginal nation. If successful, any number of new issues would arise:
   --Would the Aboriginal nation, with its capacity to act in relation to the <LOCATION>Commonwealth</LOCATION>, be able to act in relation to other states as well -- <LOCATION>Libya</LOCATION>, for example? 

   --Would it have rights and obligations under international law? 

   --Would it have standing in international organizations, the <LOCATION>Warsaw</LOCATION> Pact for example? 

   --What would happen to <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s position of Australian sovereignty in matters such as resources, transport, communications and trade? 

   Despite these misgivings about a treaty, I am optimistic that the future of Aborigines will be bright once the taint of paternalism can be eradicated. 
Some months ago the Economist magazine described <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> policy toward its native peoples as "helping those who want to join the mainstream society and building wigwams for those who don't." 
In <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>, younger people especially are drifting away from the wigwams, looking for a place in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s contemporary society. 
They must be allowed to change and grow over time, just like any other people, so that they are not condemned to permanent dependence. 
Many Aborigines are making a go of it in mainstream <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>. 
They don't parade their Aboriginality; they just get on with living as Australians in today's world. 

   Yet they often come up against unnecessary obstacles. 
Government policies over the past 20 years have priced Aborigines out of the job market. 
In addition, much of the <MONEY>two billion Australian dollars</MONEY> that have been spent on Aboriginal welfare over the past 10 years has been wasted on an unnecessary bureaucracy and projects that were doomed to fail from the outset. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Department of Aboriginal Affairs</ORGANIZATION>, to name but one, should be abolished and direct funding provided to local Aboriginal Councils in rural communities. 
Greater opportunities should be made for Aborigines to enter the private sector, and the disincentives for them to make their own way must be removed. 
In this way Aborigines would not only benefit themselves, but their participation in the economy would also make for a more productive <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>. 

   Aboriginals played a part in developing <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>. 
Aboriginal troopers and soldiers defended it. 
They want to share in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s future-not contest it.

<TEXT>
Efforts to increase significantly the money available to a federally
constituted Aboriginal land fund were defeated yesterday in the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>, the
Australian parliament's upper house. The fund is designed to acquire land on
behalf of the vast majority of Aborigines who will see no practical benefit
from the country's <ORGANIZATION>Native Title</ORGANIZATION> legislation, which was passed with much
difficulty last year. The <ORGANIZATION>Native Title</ORGANIZATION> act was the first piece of
legislation to acknowledge that <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> was inhabited before European
settlement.
At that stage the government promised to set up a land fund to make
acquisitions on behalf of dispossessed Aborigines. However, when details of
the scheme were released, critics said it was too small to be viable, and
poorly structured. Amendments put forward, but defeated in the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>
yesterday, would have increased funds flowing into the land fund to ADollars
15bn (Pounds 7bn) over a 10-year period. The current government plan is for
just ADollars 1.4bn, over the same decade - with much of this money being
invested to ensure that the fund is self-sustaining in 10 years.

   An Australian aborigine at the center
of a manhunt that sparked a public uproar was arrested with a
hostage on the <ORGANIZATION>Queensland Gold Coast</ORGANIZATION> after a 10-day sweep across
three states, police said <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   <PERSON>John Porter</PERSON>, captured <DATE>late Wednesday</DATE>, was the key suspect in the
shooting and wounding of two <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION> policemen during an attempted
car theft on <DATE>April 24</DATE>.
   One of the policemen allegedly shot by <PERSON>Porter</PERSON>, 26-year-old <PERSON>Alan
McQueen</PERSON>, died <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME> despite emergency surgery in which
doctors removed a lung, a kidney and most of his liver.
   The manhunt for <PERSON>Porter</PERSON> led to a dawn raid on a surburban <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION>
home last week in which an unarmed aborigine was fatally shot,
sparking an outcry among Australians over the rough treatment of
aborigines.
   Aboriginal activists responded to the killing of <PERSON>David Gundy</PERSON> by
putting posters up around the city calling for the murder of <PERSON>Ted
Pickering</PERSON>, police minister of <LOCATION>New South Wales</LOCATION> state.
   They also demanded a royal commission _ the highest form of
inquiry available _ into police conduct.
   Aborigines, who number about 160,000 or 1 per cent of the 16
million population, also are angered by the slow progress of a
government inquiry into more than 100 aboriginal deaths in police
custody since <DATE>1980</DATE>.
   Police conduct during the manhunt for <PERSON>Porter</PERSON> captured front-page
headlines after authorities admitted that <LOCATION>Queensland</LOCATION> police faked
an arrest, watched it reported on the evening television news and
then told the media it was a hoax.
   Police said <DATE>Thursday</DATE> that <PERSON>Porter</PERSON>, 27, recently was released from
jail on parole and said he had six other criminal convictions on
drugs and assault charges.
   Police said <PERSON>Porter</PERSON> tried <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> to kidnap a woman, but she
escaped and alerted police.
   They said <PERSON>Porter</PERSON>, who was armed with a .32-calber pistol,
surrendered quietly when surrounded outside an apartment block on
the famed coastal strip of northeast <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>.
   Police said he apparently took a man hostage after driving north
from <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION>. The hostage was not injured.
   <PERSON>Porter</PERSON> was charged at the <ORGANIZATION>Brisbane Magistrate</ORGANIZATION>'s court with
kidnapping, grievous bodily harm and use of an unlicensed firearm.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<PERSON>PAUL Keating</PERSON>, the Australian prime minister, has not enjoyed too many
political successes in recent months. But yesterday he was finally able to
declare that the issue of Aborigine land rights, which has provoked a storm
of controversy in the mining and farming sectors, was a big step closer to
resolution.
A compromise package, which clears the way for legislation later this year,
was carved out in a long cabinet meeting on <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>. As the details
became clearer during the day, cautious support from many of the interested
parties - including the mining and farming lobbies - began to emerge.
All this was the result of some hairy, last-minute bargaining. On <DATE>Monday</DATE>
<TIME>afternoon</TIME>, for example, <PERSON>Mr Keating</PERSON> told parliament that land which was held
under pastoral leases could be subject to native title claims - a statement
which reversed an earlier government commitment to farmers.
Yet by the time the cabinet meeting broke up in the small hours of <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>
<TIME>morning</TIME>, this concession to the Aborigine contingent had been dropped.
Instead, <ORGANIZATION>Aboriginal</ORGANIZATION> representatives agreed to an alternative proposal - that
they be allowed to convert their own pastoral leases into native title, thus
giving them permanent security on such land.
For the <DATE>past 16 months</DATE>, it has been touch-and-go whether the government
could broker a solution to a High Court decision which makes land rights
legislation imperative. This ruling was handed down in <DATE>June 1992</DATE>, when the
court determined that the Meriam people in the <LOCATION>Torres Strait</LOCATION> were holders of
native title on about nine square kilometres of land. The judgment became
known as the 'Mabo' decision, after <PERSON>Eddie Mabo</PERSON>, leader of the Meriam people
who had begun the court action a decade earlier.
The land involved in <LOCATION>Mabo</LOCATION> may have been modest, but the implications were
huge. Australian law had always operated on the assumption that the land was
unoccupied before European settlement - the principle of 'terra nullius'.
The High Court, by contrast, ruled that native title claims could be
successful where the indigenous people had maintained a close connection
with the land, although it also said that land titles acquired under
accepted law since European settlement should not be disturbed.
To complicate matters further, the Mabo decision determined that states and
territories could extinguish native title - but only in accordance with the
country's constitution and laws, notably the <DATE>1975</DATE> Racial Discrimination Act.
In short, compensation could be required.
Unfortunately, the <ORGANIZATION>High Court</ORGANIZATION> ruling was made in the narrow context of one
claim, and gave little guidance on the practical application of these
principles. From the outset, the federal government was forced to tread a
fine line between meeting Aboriginal demands, now backed up by the Mabo
ruling, and delivering a degree of reassurance to existing land users, such
as the mining companies and farmers, so that economic stability was not
threatened. To make the task harder, it also had to juggle a delicate
relationship with <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s states and territories, traditionally
responsible for land management.
The final package, as agreed by the cabinet this week, is complex.
Essentially, it will allow indigenous people to pursue claims for native
title either through the federal court or through state jurisdiction.
Decisions on the economic use of land, however, will remain the domain of
the states, provided they comply with the 'spirit and principles' of the
<ORGANIZATION>Commonwealth</ORGANIZATION> legislation.
All existing leases can be 'validated', and native title will then be
extinguished for all categories other than mining leases. Governments will
pick up any compensation costs resulting from validation of existing grants
and 'there will be further discussions with states and territories on
cost-sharing arrangements between the <ORGANIZATION>Commonwealth</ORGANIZATION> and complying states'.
Where land is subject to native title, the indigenous holders will not have
a veto on development, but they will have a 'right to negotiation'. <PERSON>Mr
Keating</PERSON>'s statement suggested that the time limits for negotiation would be
set at four months in the case of exploration licences, and six months for
mining leases. There would also be four- and six-month arbitration periods
for the two respective categories.
Will the package fly? On the political front, the Australian Democrats, one
of the two minority parties whose parliamentary support is essential,
welcomed the package. State premiers in <LOCATION>New South Wales</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>South Australia</LOCATION>
and the chief minister in the <ORGANIZATION>Northern Territory</ORGANIZATION> reserved judgment, but
<LOCATION>Queensland</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Victoria</PERSON> came out in support.
<ORGANIZATION>National Federation of Farmers</ORGANIZATION> supported the deal. Even the <ORGANIZATION>Australian
Mining Industry Council</ORGANIZATION>, an umbrella group for the large mining companies,
gave lukewarm endorsement. It noted that the package would at least provide
certainty by validating existing leases. But the <ORGANIZATION>AMIC</ORGANIZATION> still quarrelled with
the lack of parity between mining and pastoral leases; claimed that native
title claimants' right to choose between federal and state jurisdictions
would prove unwieldy; and maintained that all states would need to be
supportive for the package to work.
This may be the sticking point. Western <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> - a key natural resources
state - has taken the hardest line against the federal proposals to date.
Yesterday, <PERSON>Mr Richard Court</PERSON>, the Liberal premier, said the legislation could
lead to long court battles, and pointed out that up to 40 per cent of the
state may be subject to native title claim. He is due to hold talks with <PERSON>Mr
Keating</PERSON>'s legal advisers in <LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION> today.
The Aborigines' response, meanwhile, was mixed. Although Aboriginal
representatives were closely involved in the final negotiations, more
radical elements within the indigenous community were far from impressed.
'It's the coming of the second invasion,' said <PERSON>Mr Bob Weatherall</PERSON>, a
Brisbane-based activist and chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>Aboriginal Provisional
Government</ORGANIZATION>.
It was up to Aboriginal people to prove that native title existed rather
than the other way round, he commented. 'The High Court made it plain that
it was wrong for governments and commercial groups to collude in taking away
Aboriginal land interests in the past without accounting to Aboriginal
people. It must be equally wrong for the federal parliament, and the states
and territories, in <DATE>1993</DATE> to repeat the dose by 'validating'.'

THE Australian government yesterday announced plans to spend ADollars 150m
(Pounds 66m) over five years to try to improve living conditions for the
country's Aboriginal minority, and combat discrimination by white
Australians.
The spending forms the first government response to the report of a <ORGANIZATION>Royal
Commission</ORGANIZATION> into the deaths of 99 Aborigines and <ORGANIZATION>Torres Strait Islanders</ORGANIZATION> in
police custody. The <ORGANIZATION>Commission</ORGANIZATION> found that the prisoners, most of whom
committed suicide, were victims of 'entrenched and institutionalised racism
and discrimination'.
<PERSON>Mr Robert Tickner</PERSON>, Aboriginal affairs minister, said their deaths were 'the
tragic consequence of two centuries of dispossession, dispersal and
appalling disadvantage'.

<TEXT>
<LOCATION>AUSTRALIA</LOCATION>, one of the strongest supporters of sanctions against apartheid in
<LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>, is embroiled in a debate over the extent of institutionalised
racism against its Aboriginal minority, writes <PERSON>Kevin Brown</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION>.
Race relations have rarely been smooth since the first white settlers
arrived in <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION> 204 years ago. But two incidents in recent weeks suggest
that official prejudice against blacks remains widespread.
The most striking was an amateur video broadcast on <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION> television which
showed policemen at a charity function cavorting for the camera with blacked
faces and nooses around their necks.
The officers identified themselves as <PERSON>David Gundy</PERSON> and <PERSON>Lloyd Boney</PERSON>, both
Aborigines who died in police custody. <PERSON>Mr Gundy</PERSON> was shot dead in <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION> in
<DATE>1989</DATE>; <PERSON>Mr Boney</PERSON> hanged himself in a police cell in <DATE>1987</DATE>.
The screening of the video followed a documentary in which police in the
<LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION> suburb of <PERSON>Redfern</PERSON> were filmed harassing Aborigines, some of whom were
arrested for using 'offensive' language which also formed a prominent part
of the police vocabulary.
Both incidents have been condemned by political leaders of all parties. <PERSON>Mr
Paul Keating</PERSON>, the prime minister, said the video was 'a national disgrace'.
He urged Australians to 'expunge racism from every corner of this country'.
The officers, who belong to the <LOCATION>New South Wales</LOCATION> (NSW) state police, have
been placed on restricted duties, and are being investigated by the force's
internal affairs department. A separate inquiry is taking place into the
events in <LOCATION>Redfern</LOCATION>.
Aborigines reacted to the video with outrage. <PERSON>Mr Paul Coe</PERSON>, chairman of the
<ORGANIZATION>Aboriginal Legal Service</ORGANIZATION> in <PERSON>Redfern</PERSON> said the video was indicative of racism
'in all institutions throughout the states and the Commonwealth (federal
government) of <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>.' Ms <PERSON>Irene Moss</PERSON>, the federal Race Discriminations
Commissioner, said the 'outrageous' behaviour exposed in the broadcasts
reflected 'widespread involvement of police in acts of racist violence,
intimidation and harassment of Aboriginal people'.
Police officers appeared to be less concerned. <PERSON>Mr Tony Day</PERSON>, president of the
<ORGANIZATION>NSW Police Association</ORGANIZATION>, said it was a disgrace the video had been
sensationalised.

  [Text] <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION>, Dec 11 (AFP) -- <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> has closed the door 
on a controversial part of its relationship with <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> by 
agreeing to pay a <MONEY>45 million dollar</MONEY> [Australian dollars] (30 
million <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>) settlement over sites it once used for nuclear 
tests, <ORGANIZATION>Aboriginal Affairs</ORGANIZATION> Minister <PERSON>Robert Tickner</PERSON> said <DATE>Saturday</DATE>. 
  The ex-gratia payment ends a long-running dispute over the 
clean-up of British test sites at <LOCATION>Maralinga</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Monte Bello Islands</ORGANIZATION> 
and <ORGANIZATION>Emu Field</ORGANIZATION> in the southern Australian outback. 
  <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> has long argued that it was <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s 
responsibility to clean up the nuclear contamination which it 
claims still affects the lives of local Aborigines. 
  "The British decision is welcomed, it will allow <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> and 
<LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> to put behind us one of the saddest aspects of our 
relationship," <PERSON>Tickner</PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION>AFP</ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION>Canberra</LOCATION>. 
  "It is almost impossible to conceive now that atomic weapons 
were actually tested in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>, they will leave a legacy of 
contamination for many thousands of years to come." 
  The indigenous Aborigine population was driven off its 
traditional lands to make way for the British nuclear tests and 
returned in the <DATE>1980s</DATE> only to learn the area had been exposed to 
high levels of toxic contamination. 
  "As a result of the testing, Aboriginal people lost the use 
of their traditional lands, but the compensation will allow a 
clean-up and fencing where appropriate and will allow us to have 
a much more mature relationship between <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>," 
<PERSON>Tickner</PERSON> said. 
  The Aborigines filed a formal complaint to <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> in <DATE>1991</DATE>, 
leading <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> to press <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> to share rehabilitation and 
compensation costs of the <LOCATION>Maralinga</LOCATION> nuclear testing range, 
abandoned by <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> in <DATE>1967</DATE>. 
  The settlement, to be paid to <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> in installments over 
the next six years, removed a "major irritant" to the 
relationship between <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>, British Foreign 
Office Minister <PERSON>Alastair Goodlad</PERSON> said in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> <DATE>Friday</DATE>. 
  <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> had agreed in turn to abandon all further claims, 
he said. 
  Australian Primary Industries and Energy Minister <PERSON>Simon 
Crean</PERSON> 
and Foreign Affairs Minister <PERSON>Gareth Evans</PERSON> said in a joint 
statement from <LOCATION>Canberra</LOCATION> that resolution of the issue had 
vindicated <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s stance about the condition of the sites 
left by <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>. 
  "<LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> has never accepted <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s denial of legal or 
moral responsibility for this issue," the ministers said. The 
condition of the sites left by <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> "was unacceptable even by 
the standards that then applied." 
  A study by Australian, British and <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> scientists, 
completed 
in <DATE>1990</DATE>, traced the full extent of plutonium on Aborginial land 
and found that the Aborgines' outdoor lifestyle made them highly 
vulnerable to the threat of plutonium, a carcinogen.

   CORONATION HILL, Australia -- Beneath the rocky hills here
sleeps Bula, a spiritual being that roamed the Earth during
the Dreamtime. Bula created people, formed the rough
landscape and determined law. The ore is his blood. To
disturb him is to court destruction, or so say the Jawoyn
aborigines.
   For Prime Minister Bob Hawke, this area and its testy
ancient inhabitant have become a 20th-century political
headache. Located inside the southern rim of Kakadu National
Park, Guratba, as Coronation Hill is called by the
aborigines, holds reserves of gold, platinum and palladium.
Bula or no Bula, the country's mining industry wants it
exploited. Conservationists, worried about the impact on the
area's fragile ecology, are up in arms. The aborigines, for
the most part, want the proposed mine abandoned and an end to
the bickering.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Claims and counterclaims have woven a tangled, bitter tale
around Coronation Hill that is embroidered with apparent
contradictions. Archeologists publicly brawl. The Jawoyn are
split into pro-mining and anti-mining factions. The <PERSON>Hawke</PERSON>
government is divided between those who say <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s
precarious financial position dictates development of every
resource and those who argue that economics must be balanced
against costs to the environment and indigenous land rights.
   The government is set to rule as early as this week on
whether a mining consortium of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, Australian and Malaysian
interests can proceed here, in what is known as Sickness
Country. <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> is one of the world's biggest mineral
producers. To deny mining will send a negative signal to
potential investors at home and abroad and fan fears of
spreading native land rights. To allow it will invite
world-wide criticism of roughshod treatment of sensitive
aboriginal rights. It also promises to anger
conservationists, who are an increasingly important source of
votes for the beleaguered incumbent <ORGANIZATION>Labor Party</ORGANIZATION>.
   "It's a no-win situation" for the government, says <PERSON>Robin
Widdup</PERSON>, a mining analyst at securities firm <ORGANIZATION>J.B. Were &amp; Son</ORGANIZATION>.
   Leading the charge for the miners is <ORGANIZATION>Newcrest Mining Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>,
partly owned by <ORGANIZATION>Newmont Mining Corp.</ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> with a <PERCENT>14%</PERCENT>
stake and <ORGANIZATION>Broken Hill Proprietary Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s largest
company. <ORGANIZATION>Newcrest</ORGANIZATION> has a <PERCENT>45%</PERCENT> stake in Coronation Hill. Another
<PERCENT>45%</PERCENT> is owned by <ORGANIZATION>Plutonic Resources Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, whose biggest single
shareholder is Malaysian government-controlled <ORGANIZATION>Malaysia
Mining Corp</ORGANIZATION>. The rest is held by <ORGANIZATION>Norgold Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of
<ORGANIZATION>North Broken Hill Peko Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>.
   When the debate began shortly after the consortium struck
gold in Coronation Hill in the mid-1980s, it centered on
environmental concerns but later shifted to being an
aboriginal issue, says <PERSON>John Quinn</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Newcrest</ORGANIZATION>'s managing
director.
   The loser -- be it the mining lobby or the aborigines and
their conservationist allies -- will find the next battle
that much harder, industry analysts say. "If {the miners} can
roll the black fellas on this one, they can do it anywhere,
and it'll make a farce of sacred sites," says <PERSON>John Ah Kit</PERSON>, a
<ORGANIZATION>Jawoyn Association</ORGANIZATION> official.
   To most Jawoyn people, mining at Coronation Hill is like
saying "<LOCATION>Jerusalem</LOCATION> has to be razed for a spaceport," says a
former adviser to the Jawoyn. "It's like selling the Ark of
the Covenant or the <ORGANIZATION>Vatican</ORGANIZATION>. Or strip-mining the hill of
Golgotha."
   Because Bula is "men's business," women aren't allowed to
talk about it or visit certain Bula sites. Indeed, a woman
reporter is told to refer to Bula as "the thing that lives in
the mountain" and isn't allowed to ask the custodians about
the consequences of mining.
   Guratba is one of a number of sites across the top of the
continent that have been officially designated as "sacred"
because of their particular spiritual significance to
aboriginal people. In this case, though, the powerful mining
lobby argues that the evidence is tenuous, at best. Indeed,
they contend that the Bula cult is part of an elaborate
charade to strengthen the <ORGANIZATION>Jawoyn</ORGANIZATION>'s hand in a current
land-rights claim over the area. The federal government owns
the land around Coronation Hill. The Jawoyn deny any such
scheme.
   As evidence, the <ORGANIZATION>Newcrest</ORGANIZATION> consortium points to the fact
that Coronation Hill was registered as a sacred site in
<DATE>October 1985</DATE>, a few months after the mining consortium
disclosed that it had struck gold. The consortium says the
deposit contains at least 1.2 million ounces of gold and
enough platinum and palladium to make it the biggest source
of the latter two minerals in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>. It estimates the
mine's life at nine years and says it might last 20 years.
   A government inquiry into the proposed mine calculates the
net present value of production to the Australian economy at
about <MONEY>A$82 million</MONEY> (<MONEY>US$63.6 million</MONEY>), while the consortium
argues that if indirect benefits are taken into account, that
figure rises to <MONEY>A$200 million</MONEY>. Still, it's a relatively small
mine. So why all the fuss?
   The mining industry says that unless it defeats the
aborigines and conservationists on this issue, other mining
areas will be threatened.
   About <PERCENT>26%</PERCENT> of <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s land surface is heavily
restricted or is closed to new exploration and mining
activity, up from just <PERCENT>7%</PERCENT> in <DATE>1967</DATE>. Most of the restricted
areas are lands controlled by aborigines.
   After spending about <MONEY>A$14 million</MONEY> on exploration, the
consortium fears it won't get the go-ahead. Indeed, <DATE>earlier
this month</DATE>, Prime Minister <PERSON>Hawke</PERSON> appeared to prepare the
industry for a decision against mining by stressing that
Coronation Hill shouldn't be regarded as "a litmus test."
   For <PERSON>Peter Jatbula</PERSON>, <PERSON>Sandy Barraway</PERSON> and <PERSON>Nipper Brown</PERSON>, who
are aboriginal custodians of the Bula area, a decision to
halt mining can't come too soon. "A lot of white fellas come
and humbug all the time," fumes <PERSON>Mr. Barraway</PERSON>, using the
common aboriginal expression for aggravation. He blames the
stress of the debate for sending several older Jawoyns to
early graves.
   Outside advisers to the Jawoyn say that all the pressure
of justifying their ties to Sickness Country -- which forced
them to reveal certain secrets of their ceremonies and other
taboos to strangers -- helped confuse the old men and led to
conflicting stories. The mining concerns contend that Messrs.
<PERSON>Brown</PERSON> and Barraway previously agreed to mining at <ORGANIZATION>Coronation
Hill</ORGANIZATION>.

   CANBERRA, Australia -- The Australian government, bowing
to aboriginal wishes, will not allow mining at Coronation
Hill -- a move the industry says may jeopardize investment in
the country.
   Prime Minister Bob Hawke said his cabinet decided that the
fact that the site is sacred to the Jawoyn aborigines
outweighed the economic benefit of mining gold, platinum and
palladium there.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The <ORGANIZATION>Australian Mining Industry Council</ORGANIZATION> said the decision
will hurt investors' confidence in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>.
   "<LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> is proving to have the added risk of government
interference on top of the . . . risk of exploration," said
<PERSON>Murray McMillan</PERSON>, assistant director of the council. "People
will feel less sure about investing in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> and will
take their funds abroad, where the sovereign risk is less."
   Prime Minister <PERSON>Hawke</PERSON> countered the criticism, saying the
Coronation Hill decision has "no implications for proposals
to mine elsewhere," and that the site "represents a special
set of circumstances not existing elsewhere in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>."
   Political commentators see the ruling as a victory for <PERSON>Mr.
Hawke</PERSON>, who two weeks ago survived a leadership challenge from
former Treasurer <PERSON>Paul Keating</PERSON>.
   There had been rumors in <LOCATION>Canberra</LOCATION> and in financial markets
that <PERSON>Mr. Hawke</PERSON> would step down as leader if the cabinet gave
the go-ahead to the mine. <PERSON>John Kerin</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s new
treasurer, favored mining the site.
   Coronation Hill is in a conservation zone of <ORGANIZATION>Kakadu
National Park</ORGANIZATION>, in the <ORGANIZATION>Northern Territory</ORGANIZATION>. The government now
will incorporate the conservation zone into the national
park.
   The aboriginal custodians of the area are against mining
Coronation Hill on religious grounds. They fear the spirit
Bula, which they believe resides in the hill, will bring
sickness and destruction if it is disturbed. <ORGANIZATION>Newcrest Mining
Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Plutonic Resources Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> each have <PERCENT>45%</PERCENT> interests in
the Coronation Hill deposit. <ORGANIZATION>North Broken Hill Peko Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> has
a <PERCENT>10%</PERCENT> stake. <ORGANIZATION>Newmont Mining Corp.</ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> owns <PERCENT>14%</PERCENT> of
<ORGANIZATION>Newcrest; Broken Hill Proprietary Co.</ORGANIZATION> owns another <PERCENT>23%</PERCENT> of
<ORGANIZATION>Newcrest</ORGANIZATION>; and <ORGANIZATION>Poseidon Gold Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> has an <PERCENT>11.5%</PERCENT> stake. The
biggest shareholder in <ORGANIZATION>Plutonic Resources Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> is Malaysian
government-controlled <ORGANIZATION>Malaysia Mining Corp</ORGANIZATION>.
   Coronation Hill was registered as a sacred site in <DATE>October
1985</DATE>, a few months after the mining consortium disclosed that
it had struck gold. The consortium said the deposit contains
at least 1.2 million ounces of gold and enough platinum and
palladium to make it the biggest source of the latter two
minerals in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>. It estimated the mine's life at nine
years and said it might last 20 years.
   A government inquiry into the proposed mine calculated the
net current value of production to the Australian economy at
about <MONEY>82 million Australian dollars</MONEY> (<MONEY>US$62.5 million</MONEY>), while
the consortium argued that if indirect benefits are taken
into account, that figure rises to <MONEY>A$200 million</MONEY>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Newcrest</ORGANIZATION> managing director <PERSON>John Quinn</PERSON> called the decision
"a low-water mark in the government's attitude towards
investment and economic recovery in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>."
   <PERSON>Robert Tickner</PERSON>, minister for aboriginal affairs, said that
aboriginal people generally, and the Jawoyn people in
particular, aren't opposed to mining.
   Indeed, he said the Jawoyn people have signed an agreement
with <ORGANIZATION>Normandy Poseidon Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, an Australian mining company, to
explore for diamonds, gold and base metals over 1,000 square
miles of land adjacent to Coronation Hill, but not on the
sacred site.

THE AUSTRALIAN federal government has removed one of the major barriers to
the ADollars 500m (USDollars 375m) iron ore project of the <ORGANIZATION>CRA</ORGANIZATION> subsidiary,
<ORGANIZATION>Hamersley Iron</ORGANIZATION>, at <LOCATION>Marandoo</LOCATION>, in <LOCATION>Western Australia</LOCATION>.
The government has rejected an application by the Karinji aboriginal tribe
to block the project under the federal Aboriginal Heritage Protection Act.
<PERSON>Mr Robert Tickner</PERSON>, the federal minister for aboriginal affairs, said he was
not satisfied that the mining project was a serious threat to aboriginal
heritage, as required by the Act.
Hamersley Iron will now have to pass the state environmental regulations of
<LOCATION>Western Australia</LOCATION> before the project can finally proceed. A company official
yesterday said the decision was due in 20 weeks and that he was optimistic
that the project would get the state government's approval.
<PERSON>Mr Tickner</PERSON>'s decision is the latest in a series of recent moves that seem to
indicate the government's desire to offset the negative effects of its
blocking of the Coronation Hill gold and platinum mine in <DATE>June last year</DATE>.
Late last year <PERSON>Mr Tickner</PERSON> declined to use the Aboriginal Heritage Act to
block <ORGANIZATION>Dominion Mining</ORGANIZATION>'s ADollars 350m nickel project at <ORGANIZATION>Yakabindie</ORGANIZATION>, also in
<LOCATION>Western Australia</LOCATION>. However, the project is still delayed by an appeal
against the state government's approval lodged by aboriginal groups with the
<ORGANIZATION>Western Australian Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION>.
The Coronation Hill ban had reduced industry confidence in Australian mining
investments, with local companies threatening to shift substantial
exploration budgets overseas.
Last week, the Coronation Hill joint venturers, led by <ORGANIZATION>New Crest Mining</ORGANIZATION>,
filed a High Court action challenging the validity of the government plan.

<HEAD>Archaeologists Find Stone Age `Factory' in the Outback</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD BILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SYDNEY, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Archaeologists on <DATE>Friday</DATE> reported
finding a huge Stone Age ``factory'' in the <LOCATION>Outback</LOCATION> where aborigines
crafted stone blades and cutting tools for barter some 2,000 years
ago.
   Scattered among weathered stone outcrops were hundreds of
thousands of remains of stone tools and implements that point to a
sophisticated aboriginal enterprise long before Europeans set foot
on the continent.
   The site at <LOCATION>Tiboobura</LOCATION>, 530 miles northwest of <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION>, is so large
that archaeologists believe its output may have formed the basis for
a local export industry.
   ``Almost certainly, these people operated the workshop to
exchange goods,'' said <PERSON>Dan Witter</PERSON>, archaeologist for the
government's <ORGANIZATION>National Parks</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Wildlife Service</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>New South Wales</LOCATION>.
   He said <PERSON>Tiboobura</PERSON> is an aboriginal word, meaning pile of rocks, a
reference to granite hills in the area. The cutting tools were made
from a silica-based rock.
   Witter told <ORGANIZATION>The Associated Press</ORGANIZATION> the Stone Age toolmakers most
likely traded for a mildly hallucinogenic drug, Pituri. The
Australian newspaper, in a report on the quarry, said <PERSON>Pituri</PERSON> was
used by nomadic aborigines to counteract hunger pains during the
long treks between hunting grounds.
   The find follows the recent discovery of a fragment of human bone
in central <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> that has been dated at 60,000 years old,
pushing back the date of human occupation of <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> by 20,000
years.
   Indigenous aborigines number about 160,000, almost <PERCENT>one percent</PERCENT> of
<LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s 16.5 million population.
   Witter, of <ORGANIZATION>Cody</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Wyo.</LOCATION>, said the site consisted of fragments of
stone artifacts. No stone implements were found, but the discards
indicate blades up to 12 inches long that have only been found
hundreds of miles away in northern <LOCATION>Queensland</LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Northern
Territory</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``Because the site is so big, it appears aboriginal toolmakers
produced implements mainly for trade and export to other areas of
<LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>,'' <PERSON>Witter</PERSON> said.
   Tiboobura is a parched area bordered by three states _ <LOCATION>New South
Wales</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Queensland</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>South Australia</LOCATION>.
   The remains suggest the inhabitants crafted spear heads and
knives not only to hunt wildlife such as kangaroos, lizards and
dingoes, a native Australian wild dog, but as a form of industry.
   ``It takes a great deal of skill to make these things,'' <PERSON>Witter</PERSON>
said. ``We have only really scratched the surface of the material
that is lying around. There is clearly a great deal more under the
ground and that material may prove to be even more important.''
   Stone Age tool factories exist elsewhere, but <PERSON>Witter</PERSON> said the
Tiboobura site was significant because it is the first one found
where tools were made but not used locally.
   ``There's no other site like this,'' he said.
   <PERSON>Paul Jennings</PERSON>, local ranger for the <ORGANIZATION>National Parks and Wildlife
Service</ORGANIZATION>, said the tools were designed for lightness and versatility
because nomadic aborigines had to minimise the equipment they
carried.

FT  25 FEB 94 / No longer just a dreamtime: Nikki Tait examines the impact
of Australia's new legislation on relations between Aboriginal peoples and
industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<PERSON>Mr Malcolm Douglas</PERSON> wants to build a crocodile farm in <LOCATION>Broome</LOCATION>, 2,000km north
of <LOCATION>Perth</LOCATION>. He already operates a crocodile park in the remote coastal town,
but said it had become overcrowded to the point where the crocodiles were
maiming each other. The business as it stands is too small to be viable. If
the new project were to go ahead, about 20 jobs, in an area with limited
employment prospects, could be created.
The problem for <PERSON>Mr Douglas</PERSON> is that the local Yawuru Aboriginal people
believe the proposed 21-hectare plot lies on land of spiritual significance,
and that the development could interfere with their ceremonial rites. So
under legislation that came into force on <DATE>January 1</DATE>, they have lodged a
claim with <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Native Title Tribunal</ORGANIZATION>, a new federal organisation to
arbitrate on indigenous peoples' land rights.
It is one of the first demands to be submitted to the tribunal. The process
will be complex. First, the veracity of the tribe's anthropological history
must be established. Next, the claim must be registered and advertised in
local papers. Finally, hearings to determine the claim's merits may take
place.
Meanwhile, <PERSON>Mr Robert Tickner</PERSON>, federal minister for Aboriginal affairs, has
ordered a 30-day halt to work on the site. 'At last it has been recognised
that our cultural heritage is threatened,' said <PERSON>Mr Francis Djaigween</PERSON>, a
Yawuru elder.
Elsewhere, other cases are beginning to be brought under <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s native
title legislation, which was passed by parliament just before <DATE>Christmas</DATE>. The
first claim - from the Wiradjuri people over land in <LOCATION>New South Wales</LOCATION> -
passed the anthropological test yesterday.
Today debate over the degree to which the act impinges on state rights is
expected to dominate a meeting in <LOCATION>Hobart</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Tasmania</LOCATION>, between the prime
minister, <PERSON>Mr Paul Keating</PERSON>, and <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s state premiers.
The law stems from a <DATE>1992</DATE> High Court ruling that said, for the first time,
native title rights could exist in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> if the indigenous inhabitants
had maintained a 'close and continuing' association with a piece of land.
With that single ruling, the doctrine of terra nullius - the notion that
<LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> was unoccupied prior to European settlement  - was overturned.
Until then, <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> had been the only former British colony not to
recognise land ownership by the indigenous peoples - lagging <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> by 200
years and <LOCATION>New Zealand</LOCATION> by a century and a half.
The High Court ruling, however, was a mixed blessing for <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s 265,000
Aborigines, who account for 1.6 per cent of the population. While
acknowledging native title rights, the court also declared that existing
leasehold or freehold titles, which had been granted lawfully, should not be
disturbed.
Faced with squaring these two seemingly conflicting requirements, the
government drew up the <ORGANIZATION>Native Title Bill</ORGANIZATION>. This set out a system for
'validating' most existing land titles and formally cancelling competing
native title rights. Compensation for genuine Aboriginal claims would be
paid by either the state or federal government.
The law also made an exception of mining leases. For these, it said, native
titles could coexist with an existing lease and 'revive' when that lease
expired.
When the <ORGANIZATION>Native Title</ORGANIZATION> Act was passed on <DATE>December 21</DATE>, <PERSON>Mr Keating</PERSON> said it
offered 'a modicum of justice to indigenous Australians'. He added: 'Today,
we move closer to a united <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> which respects this land of ours.'
But as the legislation comes into operation and claims, such as that from
the Yawuru people, start to arrive at the tribunal, the effects are proving
more complicated. The legislation was a political compromise between
conflicting interest groups and, like most compromise deals, it extracted a
price all round.
Those affected fall into four broad groups. The first comprises the
Aborigines and the indigenous inhabitants of the <LOCATION>Torres Strait</LOCATION> islands.
Widely dispersed across <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s vast land mass, they entered the native
title debate with disparate views. For some, the act is a failure because it
eliminates native title rights on large tranches of <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> which had been
theirs.
Others have been more pragmatic, arguing that any chance to claw back some
rights should be seized. 'The land was ours and taken away from us,' said <PERSON>Mr
Peter Costello</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Cape York</LOCATION> elder, during the negotiations in <LOCATION>Canberra</LOCATION>. 'The
European people are going to lead this country, and I won't be coming here
again. But we never said that we were going to take everything . . . We just
want some vacant crown land.'
This may be a realistic assessment of what Aborigines can hope to achieve.
Over the past 200 years, many have moved - or been moved - off their
forebears' land, so the 'close and continuing' land association requirement
will not be readily met. More than a quarter of the Aboriginal population
lives in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s eight state/territory capitals.
Using such residence patterns, Aboriginal leaders estimate that only about
10 per cent of their peoples stand a realistic chance of benefiting directly
from the native title legislation.
Because land association is most likely to have been broken when freehold or
leasehold title has been granted to white settlers, the best chances of a
successful claim will be against unused land owned by the nation. Most of
this lies in west <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>. Here a bruising battle between the state and
federal governments is under way, casting a cloud of uncertainty over the
short-term progress of any claims.
While <PERSON>Mr Keating</PERSON>'s Labor government was battling to get its land rights
legislation passed in <LOCATION>Canberra</LOCATION>, the conservative Western Australian
government enacted different native title legislation in <LOCATION>Perth</LOCATION>. That removed
native title rights altogether, replacing them with much weaker 'rights to
traditional usage' of the land (for ceremonial purposes, for instance).
The <LOCATION>Western Australia</LOCATION> legislation is already under assault. Aboriginal
groups have mounted a legal challenge, claiming that it breaches federal
racial discrimination legislation.
<PERSON>Mr Keating</PERSON> has suggested that only those states and territories that support
the federal act will get federal help with compensation payments. <PERSON>Mr Richard
Court</PERSON>, premier of <LOCATION>Western Australia</LOCATION>, said that amounted to 'blackmail'. He
has some backing from other states and territories, which have yet to
introduce their own legislation on the subject.
Even if the federal regime eventually prevails - as seems likely -
short-term confusion is inevitable, further complicating procedures for
processing Aboriginal claims. No sooner had <PERSON>Mr Tickner</PERSON> issued his order over
<LOCATION>Broome</LOCATION>'s proposed crocodile farm, for example, than the Western Australian
authorities announced they would challenge it.
As for the 90 per cent of Aborigines who may gain little directly from the
legislation, the Native Title Act promises a new land fund to assist
Aboriginal land purchases and management 'in a way that provides economic,
environmental, social or cultural benefits'. The fund will form part of a
broader 'social justice' package designed to address the disadvantages faced
by the Aboriginal population.
For many Aborigines, this is every bit as important as the act itself. But
they will have to wait for the details: <LOCATION>Canberra</LOCATION> has yet to set a budget for
the fund and has said the package would not be finalised until <DATE>1995</DATE>.
The second group affected by the legislation is the mining industry, which
believes it has lost heavily under the new law. It complains that the costs
of doing business in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> will go up, forcing many companies to look
abroad for new projects.
To some extent, however, the complaints of the mining industry are
exaggerated. Existing leases are 'validated' by the new act, and if a lease
granted before <DATE>1994</DATE> contained a specific right to renew, that too is
enforceable.
But future exploration, say the mining companies, is another matter. The
<ORGANIZATION>Australian Mining Industry Council</ORGANIZATION> estimated that the new tribunal might
delay the development of a project by up to two years, and said its members
were already reassessing their exploration plans.
'Title problems are getting worse,' said <PERSON>Mr Hugh Morgan</PERSON>, head of Western
Mining and one of the Native Title Act's most outspoken critics. 'Most
exploration programmes are studying their navels at present for 1994-95.
They (the implications of the Act) are only slowly permeating down.'
The <ORGANIZATION>AMIC</ORGANIZATION> points to a report by the <ORGANIZATION>Centre of International Economics</ORGANIZATION> on the
impact of an Aboriginal land rights law that operated in the <ORGANIZATION>Northern
Territory</ORGANIZATION> since <DATE>1976</DATE>, and the degree to which it has restricted mining
activity. The report estimates that the law has cost the <ORGANIZATION>Northern Territory</ORGANIZATION>
about ADollars 2.39bn (Pounds 1.2bn) in income over the period.
Defenders of the federal act, however, point out that <ORGANIZATION>Northern Territory</ORGANIZATION> law
differs significantly from the new legislation - giving Aborigines a right
of veto over mining exploration, for example. At the same time, they say,
the <ORGANIZATION>CIE</ORGANIZATION> study used figures based on numbers of exploration licences. That
gives a distorted picture, because exploration on Aboriginal land tends be
large scale. Four-fifths of the minerals produced in the <ORGANIZATION>Northern Territory</ORGANIZATION>
come from Aboriginal land, according to the <ORGANIZATION>Central Land Council</ORGANIZATION>, which
represents local Aboriginal landholders and claimants.
Nevertheless, the need to resolve native title issues will inevitably add
something to a mining company's costs. How much, and the extent to which it
makes offshore alternatives more attractive, will depend on a variety of
factors - ranging from the efficiency of the <ORGANIZATION>Native Title Tribunal</ORGANIZATION> and the
attitude of individual Aboriginal groups to external factors such as
<LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s exchange rate.
The mining industry admits that it will take time for the impact of the new
law to be felt. 'In fact, the exploration dollar spent over the next couple
of years will probably go up,' said <PERSON>Mr Geoffrey Ewing</PERSON>, assistant director of
the <ORGANIZATION>AMIC</ORGANIZATION>, pointing to the long-term nature of the mining business. But
eventually, he warned, 'it's just one of those things which will tip the
balance for some companies'.
Other land-based industries, ranging from <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s farming community to
the large tourism sector, are the third group affected by the act. In
general, thanks to deft lobbying by the <ORGANIZATION>National Farmers Federation</ORGANIZATION>, these
are relatively well protected under the legislation because land titles will
be validated.
Any new businesses, however, and those looking to expand or relocate will in
future have to bear in mind the possibility of an Aboriginal challenge - as
the <PERSON>Malcolm Douglas</PERSON> case demonstrates.
The fourth principal effect of the new legislation is on Australian
identity. Most sea-hugging, city-dwelling Australians learn about the
problems of the Aboriginal population second-hand, but their reaction to the
legislation nonetheless has been mostly favourable. As <PERSON>Mr Keating</PERSON> said, no
one's home would be seized, taxes had not risen, jobs were not affected. For
little obvious cost, Australians had gained a sense of having righted old
wrongs.
Whether this mood would persist if an economic price became apparent is more
debatable. There have been suggestions that the costs of the native title
legislation, plus the accompanying Aboriginal social justice package, could
lead to a tax rise at a later date. But even if federal finances taxes do
increase, <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s long-term unemployment problem is more likely to be
blamed than the Aborigines.
All along, realpolitik has been at the centre of the Australian native title
debate. The country has tried to find a method of melding its original
culture, with its spiritual values and its belief that land is integral to a
way of life, with a more commercial, western approach. While the solution
may lack elegance, <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> is at least offering something to its
indigenous peoples - albeit 200 years too late.
As one Perth-based judge, commenting on the Yawuru case, remarked: 'On one
view, this is a classic clash between God and mammon. The economic interests
of a commercial enterprise are set against the spiritual and cultural life
of a section of the community.
'Of course,' he continued, 'it is not that simple. Both sets of interests
are entirely legitimate.'

FT  19 OCT 93 / Native rights will apply to farm leases, says Keating
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR <PERSON>Paul Keating</PERSON>, the Australian prime minister, yesterday delivered a blow
to the nation's farmers when he hinted that proposed native land rights
legislation would allow claims against land held under pastoral leases.
The government had previously indicated that only mining leases would fail
to extinguish native title, which, in turn, could 'co-exist' with the mining
lease and revive once the latter expired.
During parliamentary question time yesterday, <PERSON>Mr Keating</PERSON> said he expected
only about 11 pastoral leases issued between the implementation of the <DATE>1975</DATE>
Racial Discrimination Act and <DATE>1993</DATE> to be affected by the government's
legislation.
But he said native title claimants could make claims under common law on all
of the thousands of pastoral leases issued before <DATE>1975</DATE>.
The government has been battling to draw up a system for deciding Aborigine
land claims, in the wake of a High Court decision last year. This ruling,
known as the 'Mabo' decision, threw out the notion that <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> was
essentially unoccupied before European settlement, and suggested the
Aborigine claims could be valid where there had been close and continuing
association with the land in question.
The <ORGANIZATION>National Farmers</ORGANIZATION>' Federation campaigned strongly for a ban on native
title rights on all pastoral leases. Aboriginal groups, by contrast, argued
that pastoral leases should be among the leases which did not extinguish
native title rights.
<PERSON>Mr Keating</PERSON> said yesterday the legislation would allow states to validate all
pastoral leases without the lessees having to disprove the existence of
residual native title. Holders of pastoral leases on land covered by native
title would have primacy, with no question of co-ownership.
'The only question then at issue is whether in validating these leases, we
should go so far as to extinguish native title completely and forever, or
whether we should leave the relationship between lease rights and native
title to the common law,' he said.
Under the envisaged legislation, native title claimants would still be able
to claim residual rights through claims in the courts.
<PERSON>Mr Keating</PERSON> added he believed such cases had little chance. The Australian
cabinet was meeting to discuss the draft 'Mabo' legislation yesterday, and
there have been suggestions it could be presented to parliament in a matter
of weeks.

FT  29 NOV 94 / Aborigine land fund setback
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The <ORGANIZATION>Australian Senate</ORGANIZATION>, the federal parliament's upper house, yesterday
referred the government's contentious Aboriginal land fund legislation to a
select committee for further examination.
The move came despite warnings from Senator <PERSON>Gareth Evans</PERSON>, the government's
<ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> leader, that this could trigger a 'double dissolution', that is, a
dissolution of both houses, necessitating fresh elections.
The legislation proposes to establish a ADollars 1.4bn (Pounds 680m) land
fund by <DATE>2004</DATE>, through a series of government payments over the next 10
years. By using the money to make land purchases, the fund would aim to help
dispossessed Aborigines who are unlikely to benefit from last year's <ORGANIZATION>Native
Title</ORGANIZATION> legislation.
The proposed structure of the land fund and the relatively low level of
financing have been criticised by some Aboriginal groups. In recent weeks,
the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>, where the government does not have a majority, has made a large
number of amendments to the bill. But the government refused to accept these
and returned the legislation to the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>.
Yesterday, <PERSON>Senator Evans</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s foreign minister, warned the
government would treat a select committee reference 'as a failure to pass
this legislation within the meaning of the Constitution, Section 57'. This
states that if legislation passed by the <ORGANIZATION>House of Representatives</ORGANIZATION> is
rejected or obstructed by the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> twice within certain time limits,
<LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s governor general may dissolve both houses simultaneously.
The notion that the government will seek to call an early election, before
the economic outlook clouds, has circulated for some months, and the land
fund hiatus could provide an excuse. But, in issuing his warning, <PERSON>Senator
Evans</PERSON> emphasised yesterday that the government was not looking for an
'artificial trigger'.
Meanwhile, <PERSON>Senator Brian Harradine</PERSON>, an independent whose vote was crucial to
securing the committee referral, pointed out that a double dissolution
trigger was already in place because of the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>'s decision to reject
certain immigration-related legislation.

   Political disorders, ethnic tensions,

in an arc curving sharply northward from <LOCATION>New Zealand</LOCATION> and back down

a taste of trouble in the past year.
   Most recently it was rioting in <LOCATION>Vanuatu</LOCATION> over land claims, and in
the French territory of <LOCATION>New Caledonia</LOCATION> 19 native Kanaks were killed
in a shootout with French troops in ethnic and political disorders.
   <LOCATION>Fiji</LOCATION> has seen two coups in the past year, and the former British

   <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> is concerned about what it sees as the speading
influence of <LOCATION>Libya</LOCATION>'s Col. <PERSON>Moammar Gadhafi</PERSON> in the area and the
inroads made by the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> in what long has been seen as an
``American lake.''
   A commentator in the <ORGANIZATION>Sydney Morning Herald</ORGANIZATION> newspaper said the
image of a South Seas paradise may have been permanently tarnished.
   The past year also has seen riots in <LOCATION>Tahiti</LOCATION> and political
upheaval in <LOCATION>Papua New Guinea</LOCATION> over the alleged corruption of Cabinet
ministers.
   <LOCATION>New Zealand</LOCATION> faces racial unrest as indigenous Maoris press the
<ORGANIZATION>Labor Party</ORGANIZATION> government of Prime Minister <PERSON>David Lange</PERSON> with a battery
of land and fisheries claims.
   In <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>, aborigines are using this year's bicentennial
celebrations to highlight grievances they say grew out of European
settlement 200 years ago.
   In early <DATE>May</DATE>, bloody violence erupted over territorial and
French presidential elections in <LOCATION>New Caledonia</LOCATION>, culminating in the
rescue of French hostages held in caves by Melanesian separatists;
21 people were killed.
   On <DATE>May 16</DATE>, a drunken mob ran riot through <LOCATION>Vanuatu</LOCATION>'s capital,
<LOCATION>Port Vila</LOCATION>, looting shops and smashing office windows. One man died,
nine others were injured and police arrested 30 people in the
rioting over land claims.
   <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New Zealand</LOCATION> responded to the crisis by airlifting
riot-control gear to <LOCATION>Vanuatu</LOCATION> at Prime Minister <PERSON>Walter Lini</PERSON>'s
request.
   Prime Minister <PERSON>Bob Hawke</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> linked <LOCATION>Libya</LOCATION> to the
rioting and said <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> could not stand by as a friendly
country's government is undermined by what he called a
non-democratic process.
   ``There is no doubt about a Libyan connection in <LOCATION>Vanuatu</LOCATION>,''
<PERSON>Hawke</PERSON> said. ``In a city with a population of less than 20,000 it is
clear that these disturbances have been on a very serious scale.''
   <LOCATION>Vanuatu</LOCATION>, formerly the British-French <LOCATION>New Hebrides</LOCATION>, shocked the
generally pro-Western <LOCATION>South Pacific</LOCATION> with its decision in <DATE>1986</DATE> to
establish diplomatic relations with <LOCATION>Libya</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>.
   Since then, the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> has sought fishing agreements with
<LOCATION>Papua New Guinea</LOCATION> and impoverished <LOCATION>Kiribati</LOCATION>, creating concern in
<LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> as well as <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> about Soviet inroads in the region.
   More recently, the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> has approached <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> for
fishing access to Australian ports for refueling purposes and to
Australian airports for fishing crews in transit. <PERSON>Hawke</PERSON> said he
would treat the request with caution.
   Elsewhere in the <LOCATION>South Pacific</LOCATION>, such nations as <LOCATION>Tonga</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Western Samoa</LOCATION> face poverty, overcrowding and unemployment. Many of
the islanders have migrated to <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New Zealand</LOCATION> in search
of jobs.
   ``All these are turning the once tranquil South Pacific into an
increasingly complex set of real and potential troublespots,'' the
<ORGANIZATION>Sydney Morning Herald</ORGANIZATION> said.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Sydney Daily Telegraph</ORGANIZATION> echoed that concern, calling the
situation a powderkeg.
   ``The multiple problems of these islands has led to a rising
discontent,'' the <ORGANIZATION>Telegraph</ORGANIZATION> said. ``<LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> has been making big
efforts to gain a stronger foothold in every island group through
fishery deals and aid.''
   Racial and ethnic divisions remain a major underlying problem of
many <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> islands, where populations are mainly Melanesian. <LOCATION>Fiji</LOCATION>
and <LOCATION>New Caledonia</LOCATION> are examples.
   <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> is the major power in the region and its largest aid
donor.
   Foreign Minister <PERSON>Bill Hayden</PERSON> has expressed concern about Libyan
activities, going as far as to close down <LOCATION>Libya</LOCATION>'s diplomatic
mission in <LOCATION>Canberra</LOCATION> <DATE>last year</DATE> after an incident involving the

   <PERSON>Mansell</PERSON> had returned from <LOCATION>Libya</LOCATION> saying <PERSON>Gadhafi</PERSON> was prepared to
bankroll a black revolution in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>.
   The scattered violence in the <LOCATION>South Seas</LOCATION> has no single
connective thread, although in <LOCATION>New Caledonia</LOCATION> and French Polynesia
the crises erupted after <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> refused to follow the regional
pattern of decolonization and independence.
   <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> already suffers a major image problem in the <LOCATION>South Seas</LOCATION>
with the bombing of the <ORGANIZATION>Greenpeace</ORGANIZATION> vessel <ORGANIZATION>Rainbow Warrior</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New

   The island states, supported by <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New Zealand</LOCATION>, have
declared the <LOCATION>South Pacific</LOCATION> a nuclear-free zone.
   In a major turnaround, the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> in <DATE>1986</DATE> designated the

<TEXT>
THE AUSTRALIAN government is under pressure to introduce new direct taxes
and broaden indirect taxation. An official report yesterday showed national
savings at the lowest level in 30 years and that the government needed to
raise ADollars 20bn (Pounds 8.6bn) a year in order to achieve its target
budget deficit of 1 per cent of gross domestic product in <DATE>1996</DATE>.
The report, commissioned by the federal government, found that national
savings stood at 16 per cent of GDP. The low savings level was due largely
to the public sector, with both federal and state governments running
greatly increased deficits in recent years.
Some new taxes that could be considered were inheritance and wealth taxes,
and widening capital gains tax to include family homes.
<PERSON>Mr John Dawkins</PERSON>, the federal treasurer, is expected to use the report as
ammunition in next week's annual meeting with state premiers to prepare for
the federal budgets. State governments have been openly hostile to <PERSON>Mr
Dawkins</PERSON>' calls to further cut their spending and raise taxes.
<LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> yesterday accepted a ADollars 45m compensation payment from
<LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> for cleaning contaminated nuclear tests sites in <LOCATION>South Australia</LOCATION>
used by the <ORGANIZATION>UK</ORGANIZATION> in the <DATE>1950s</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Reuter</ORGANIZATION> reports from <LOCATION>Canberra</LOCATION>.
Senator <PERSON>Gareth Evans</PERSON>, foreign minister, and <PERSON>Mr Simon Crean</PERSON>, primary
industries minister, said details would be settled soon and <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> would
agree not to pursue further its claims relating to the test sites at
<LOCATION>Maralinga</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION>.
The test sites were home to Aborigines. The Tjarutja Aborigines were granted
title to traditional lands inside <LOCATION>Maralinga</LOCATION> in <DATE>1984</DATE>, before a scientific
team discovered the land was more contaminated than the British had
reported.
The Aborigines are now denied access to 1,200 square miles of their land
because of the contamination and are seeking compensation.

FT  11 SEP 93 / Geography overwhelms history in search for the real
Australia: Nikki Tait interviews Paul Keating, who meets the Queen next week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE last time <PERSON>Paul Keating</PERSON> met the <LOCATION>Queen</LOCATION>, there was a small furore when the
Australian prime minister, only two months into the job, put his arm round
the British monarch's waist. '<ORGANIZATION>Mocking Her Majesty</ORGANIZATION>,' screamed one British
tabloid. 'Hands orf Cobber,' yelled another.
So, sitting in the <LOCATION>Canberra</LOCATION>'s modernist <ORGANIZATION>Parliament House</ORGANIZATION>, without a silver
salver in sight, the Australian premier is trying to inject a little
gravitas to their next meeting, at <LOCATION>Balmoral</LOCATION> in a week's time. Questions
about his potential reception in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> are parried with sober poise. Even
mention of the tabloid press generates sarcasm, not the colourful epithets
which <PERSON>Keating</PERSON> bandies so adroitly in local political brawls.
But if the Prime Minister's demeanour is muted, his message is not.
Republicanism - that is, <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s right to appoint its own head of state,
rather than have the British monarch wished on it - has been Australian
Labor party policy for a decade. <PERSON>Mr Keating</PERSON> has become its most forceful
advocate.
'The republic is a constitutional, historical and political necessity for
<LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>,' he declares. '<LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> cannot represent itself to the world as
a multicultural society, engage in <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION>, make that link and make it
persuasively, while, in some way, at least in constitutional terms,
remaining a derivative society.'
In the <PERSON>Keating</PERSON> school of argument, the need for constitutional change
follows an economic drift. Today, <ORGANIZATION>Asia-Pacific</ORGANIZATION> accounts for more than 60 per
cent of <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s trade while half of new immigrants come from that
region.
Twenty years ago, notes <PERSON>Mr Keating</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> had a '<LOCATION>White Australia</LOCATION>' policy
which mitigated against Asian migrants and was only abandoned by the
government of <PERSON>Gough Whitlam</PERSON> in the early <DATE>1970s</DATE>. 'That's not a long time
ago,' he says. 'In the event, we were very lucky not to be marginalised by
<LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION>. 'Countries in this part of the world have long memories.'
Economic expediency, however, is only one aspect of the Republicanism
debate. Much more fundamental is <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s search for a national identity.
This is a complex issue for a country that has increasingly significant
financial ties to its neighbours, a weight of cultural bonds with <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>,
and must somehow also find a place for its Aboriginal population, whose
rights have suddenly become big news.
This is largely because of a High Court ruling last year which found that a
group of Aboriginal people were holders of native land title. The previous
concept of 'terra nullius' - that <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> was not occupied before European
settlement - was quashed.
The Mabo ruling, named after <PERSON>Eddie Mabo</PERSON>, the leader of the Meriam people who
began the High Court case in <DATE>1982</DATE>, generated a frenzied backlash from other
interested parties, notably mining companies.
A touch of fervour creeps into <PERSON>Mr Keating</PERSON>'s voice when conversation turns to
Mabo. 'The stain of dispossession still affects our society and our
relationship with the indigenes,' he says. 'Mabo is part of a broader agenda
of reconciliation.
'The highest court in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> has declared that Aboriginal custom and
title is a source of Australian common law, and that native title exists in
common law. But there is no body of administrative law to express that
native title. What the government has been developing is a body of
administrative law to hear, award and protect native title, and to see that
the dual aims of justice for aboriginal and islander people, and the
economic imperatives of the country go together.'
Some of these matters, he is sure, will surface at <LOCATION>Balmoral</LOCATION>, although he
does not believe he will either surprise the British monarch, or chill the
atmosphere. 'I think she will have read the things I've said in public to
date ..She has absorbed the cultures of umpteen prime ministers over the
years. I'm sure she can cope with me adequately.'
In truth, even if the atmosphere in <LOCATION>Scotland</LOCATION> did drop a few degrees, it
would probably be a good deal warmer than the political climate back home.
Less than six months after his unexpected election victory, <PERSON>Mr Keating</PERSON> is
being jostled on all sides.
The new government's first budget, unveiled last month, has been stymied in
parliment, and concessions wrung by both the opposition parties and the
Labor party caucus. Uncertainty surrounding passage of this package has
contributed to a plunge in the Australian dollar, now at a seven-year low.
On the crucial issue of labour market reform, <PERSON>Mr Keating</PERSON> appears to have
bowed to the powerful union lobby, and seems likely to temper government
plans. Recent polls, meanwhile, have shown a significant drop in <PERSON>Mr
Keating</PERSON>'s personal approval rating.
All this has prompted some commentators to suggest that the Prime Minister -
often seen as a distant figure, who ploughs his own furrow without excessive
consultation - may have to adjust his approach. So what lessons has <PERSON>Mr
Keating</PERSON> learnt from his rough ride during the past few weeks? 'Just that
politics is rough riding,' he retorts tartly, as the diplomatic demeanour
eases briefly.

managing director of <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Western Mining Corporation Holdings</ORGANIZATION>, of
waging a hate campaign over a court decision granting aborigines land title.
<PERSON>Mr Morgan</PERSON>, head of one of <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s biggest mining groups, said a landmark
<DATE>1992</DATE> High Court ruling on native land title, known as the Mabo ruling after
one of the original plaintiffs, would create racial tension and economic
stagnation.
'You've got a representative of one of <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s mining giants waging this
campaign of hate and bitterness against aboriginal people and it's just got
to stop,' <PERSON>Mr Tickner</PERSON> said in a radio interview.
'It's so far over the top, so divisive, and for any of us to give it any
credibility. . . is, I think, profoundly un-Australian.'

<BYLINE>Aborigines Condemn Police Conduct in Manhunt</BYLINE>

   Native and civil rights groups demand
the state police minister resign because of a manhunt for an
aborigine suspect in which an innocent man was fatally shot and
officers staged a fake arrest.
   An aboriginal activist group even put up posters <DATE>Monday</DATE> saying
the <LOCATION>New South Wales</LOCATION> police minister, <PERSON>Ted Pickering</PERSON>, should be shot.
   The way police conducted their search for a <PERSON>John Porter</PERSON>,
suspected of wounding two officers in <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION> <DATE>a week ago</DATE>, has
angered the state ombudsman and political opposition as well as
aboriginal and civil rights organizations.
   Aborigines, already chafing at the slow pace of a government
inquiry into more than 100 black deaths in police custody, accused
authorities of conducting a witch hunt in the search for <PERSON>Porter</PERSON>.
Aboriginal activists claim most of the deaths since <DATE>1980</DATE> have been
due to police brutality.
   Police Commissioner <PERSON>John Avery</PERSON> urged the suspect to surrender to
avert further bloodshed. He said investigating officers were
``abundantly aware that every move they make will come under
microscopic scrutiny.''
   ``I don't want the suspect to feel too harried or pursued or
he's going to react violently, and that means more lives will be
lost,'' <PERSON>Avery</PERSON> said. ``What we want is to resolve this peacefully
without any more people being killed.''
   <PERSON>Porter</PERSON>'s family said he should not surrender.
   <PERSON>Jenny Davies</PERSON>, 28, common-law wife of the suspect's brother,
said: ``If he showed his face, police would shoot him dead. They
wouldn't give him a chance. They would shoot him on sight for sure.
One innocent man has already been shot dead by police over this.''
   Police say <PERSON>Porter</PERSON> emptied an automatic pistol at two policemen
who thought he was trying to steal a car in <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION> a week ago, then
eluded pursuit in the city and is being hunted on a national scale.
   One of the policemen, <PERSON>Alan McQueen</PERSON>, 26, was in critical
condition <DATE>Monday</DATE> after surgeons removed a lung, a kidney and part
of his liver. The other wounded man, 19-year <PERSON>Jason Donnelly</PERSON>, was
discharged after treatment for a stomach wound.
   When the hunt began in earnest, ``it was a bad week in <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION>
for colored men with dreadlock hair,'' the <ORGANIZATION>Morning Herald</ORGANIZATION> said.
Blacks with Rastafarian hairstyles complained of police harassment.
   Officers rounded up dozens of people for questioning, in one
case stopping a car carrying three men from <LOCATION>Tonga</LOCATION>. One was found to
be in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> illegally and was deported.
   On <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, police stormed the home of <PERSON>David Gundy</PERSON> and fatally
shot the unarmed aborigine. Police initially said <PERSON>Gundy</PERSON>, who was in
bed, lunged at them and went for a gun, but then contradicted the
original statement.
   <PERSON>Richard McDonald</PERSON>, a neighbor, said he overheard a detective
saying: ``I was sure it was him (<PERSON>Porter</PERSON>). He was around the same
size.''
   Another neighbor, <PERSON>Brian Walsh</PERSON>, was awakened by the sound of
police kicking in <LOCATION>Gundy</LOCATION>'s door.
   That same day, police raided six houses in <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Brisbane</LOCATION>,
in <LOCATION>Queensland</LOCATION> state. They fired five stun grenades into the empty
home of <PERSON>Porter</PERSON>'s brother and faked an arrest that was filmed for
the evening television news, then told the media it was a hoax.
   The Gundy shooting brought calls for <ORGANIZATION>Pickering</ORGANIZATION>'s resignation and
demands for a <ORGANIZATION>Royal Commission of Inquiry</ORGANIZATION>, the highest
investigation available, into police conduct.
   On <DATE>Monday</DATE>, an aboriginal group calling itself the Coalition
Against Legalized Murder, or CALM, distributed posters in <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION>
that showed <PERSON>Pickering</PERSON>'s head framed in a gunsight and said someone
should ``upgrade'' Premier <PERSON>Nick Greiner</PERSON>'s government ``with a
bullet.''
   <PERSON>Pickering</PERSON> said he was considering legal action.

<HEAD>Aboriginal Law Stops Hunt For Killer Crocodile</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DARWIN, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Aboriginal elders today invoked tribal
laws to protect a crocodile that killed a member of their tribe,
telling police to stop hunting the reptile because it is sacred.
   Police reported that aboriginal clans were holding a tribal
meeting to decide what to do after a 25-year-old aborigine of the
Gumatj tribe in the <ORGANIZATION>Northern Territory</ORGANIZATION> was found bitten in half at
a pond.
   The victim was not identified but was believed to have been
snatched while camping alone 10 miles from the mouth of the <LOCATION>Cato
River</LOCATION>. An autopsy was to be carried out in <LOCATION>Darwin</LOCATION> after the upper
half of his body was found <DATE>Sunday</DATE>.
   Police wanted to search for the rest of his body by shooting
saltwater crocodiles that inhabit the <LOCATION>Cato River</LOCATION> of Arnhem Land,
near where the attack took place.
   But aboriginal elders today gave police strict instructions not
to shoot or even approach any crocodile they suspect is responsible
until a decision is made.
   Saltwater crocodiles are found across northern <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>. The
reptiles were declared a protected species in <DATE>1974</DATE> when they were
threatened with extinction because of indiscriminate hunting for
their skins. Conservationists now note that crocodiles, which have
no natural predators, have grown in size and have lost their fear
of man.
   At least 11 people have been killed by crocodiles in the past
two years.
   <PERSON>Brian Walsh</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>Northern Territory Conservation Commission</ORGANIZATION>'s
chief wildlife officer, said local aborigines regard crocodiles as
sacred.
   ``You have to realize that in East Arnhem Land the crocodile is
of totemic significance and is very important to the culture ... so
they won't make any decision until they have all sat down and had a
meeting about it,'' he said.

<HEAD>About 300 Aborigines Riot, Seven Arrested</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PERTH, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 300 aborigines smashed windows,
damaged cars and fought with police late <DATE>Monday</DATE> following the
funeral of an aboriginal man who died in a jail cell.
   Police reported seven people were arrested during the violence
in <LOCATION>Geraldton</LOCATION>, a town in <LOCATION>Western Australia</LOCATION> state 360 miles north of
<LOCATION>Perth</LOCATION>.
   Geraldton police superintendent <PERSON>Adrian Barnes</PERSON> said no one was
seriously injured in the rioting.
   Mayor <PERSON>Faye Campbell</PERSON> estimated the damage at <MONEY>$80,000</MONEY>.
   Some of the aborigines had attended the funeral <DATE>Monday</DATE> of <PERSON>Edward
Charles Cameron</PERSON>, 23, who was found hanged in a cell at the town
jail on <DATE>July 8</DATE>. He had been charged with breaking into a store and
was awaiting trial.
   After the service the aborigines marched to a building in
<LOCATION>central Geraldton</LOCATION> where the <LOCATION>Western Australia</LOCATION> state Cabinet was
meeting and a delegation met with Premier <PERSON>Peter Dowding</PERSON> and Police
Minister <PERSON>Ian Taylor</PERSON>.
   The delegation, led by <PERSON>Cameron</PERSON>'s father and aboriginal elder
<PERSON>Leedham Cameron</PERSON>, called for the removal of the policeman in charge
of the inquiry into the jail death.
   <PERSON>Cameron</PERSON> said important information relating to his son's death
had been withheld by the investigating officer, inspector <PERSON>Eric
Cousins</PERSON>, but he did not elaborate. Taylor refused the delegation's
demand that he remove Cousins from the inquiry.

   DARWIN, Australia -- Bill Harney used to earn a living
rounding up cattle across the Northern Territory, but he
traded in a stockman's saddle for a four-wheel drive and a
mob of tourists.
   Mr. Harney, who thinks he is about 60 years old, is one of
a small group of Australia's aborigines who are trying their
hands as tour guides to their ancient culture. In Mr.
Harney's case, the cradle of his family's culture lies about
75 miles west of the outback town of Katherine -- on a cattle
ranch owned by the Sultan of Brunei.

   Aborigines share in the management of some national parks
located on their traditional lands. But various aboriginal
groups began venturing into tourism in the early <DATE>1980s</DATE> when
<LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s tourist industry took off and visitors began
exploring more remote regions. For some aboriginal groups
living in the country's top end, it was their first contact
with large numbers of outsiders.
   Besides noticing that the visitors had a lot of money to
spend, the locals were struck by the misinformation that the
travelers had got hold of and the questions they asked.
   Hosting tourists is a way for aborigines to dispel myths
about their culture, says <PERSON>Chris Burchett</PERSON>, who has acted as
the government tourist authority's aboriginal liaison manager
for the past seven years. Moreover, he says, aborigines "see
it as a way of educating and restoring pride among their own
kids."
   Today, there is an array of tours ranging from a couple of
hours -- the <LOCATION>Edible Desert</LOCATION> Tour at <ORGANIZATION>Ayers Rock</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s
arid center for <MONEY>10 Australian dollars</MONEY> (<MONEY>US$7.65</MONEY>) -- to
<LOCATION>Umorrduk</LOCATION>, a two-day A$635 sojourn into Arnhem Land in the far
north corner of the <ORGANIZATION>Northern Territory</ORGANIZATION> where non-aboriginals
need a permit to travel.
   Still, it has been a hard sell. That is partly because of
prejudice, industry officials contend, with international
wholesale tour operators concerned that the tours will be
unreliable, officials say.
   Some incidents have occurred. Darwin-based Territory Park
Tours, for instance, dropped a half-day aboriginal tour of
<ORGANIZATION>Kakadu National Park</ORGANIZATION> from its itinerary after clients
complained that the aboriginal guide was either
uncommunicative or didn't show up at all. A tourism official
says problems with that tour have been rectified.
   Tourism also can be an unhappy affair for aborigines
themselves. <PERSON>Mr. Burchett</PERSON> recalls a group of Aranda people
near <PERSON>Alice Springs</PERSON> who decided to put on an inma, or
collection of ceremonial dances, for tourists. The selection
even included a dance featuring a kadaitja, or the aboriginal
equivalent of a hired assassin. Like his forefathers before
him, the assassin wore boots made from emu feathers designed
to leave no telltale tracks.
   The recital was disrupted, however, when a disgruntled
group of American tourists stalked out and demanded their
money back. Their complaint was that the performance wasn't
genuine because it didn't include didgeridoos, traditional
musical instruments that, in fact, aren't part of the desert
people's culture. The Aranda "were upset to the point they
never danced {publicly} again. They felt ashamed," <PERSON>Mr.
Burchett</PERSON> says.
   <PERSON>Mr. Harney</PERSON>'s experience with tourists has been more
rewarding, although he says he still hasn't made any money
despite charging A$195 a person for an overnight trip. He
decided to start tours of his traditional lands in <DATE>May 1989</DATE>.
A member of the Wardaman language group, he is a senior
custodian of the group's traditional lands, which span the
sultan's vast spread known as Willeroo station.
   With the sultan's permission, <PERSON>Mr. Harney</PERSON> picks up tourists
twice a week in <PERSON>Katherine</PERSON> and drives them to Willeroo. There
they view rock-art sites from the aboriginal creation age
known as the Dreamtime. There are perhaps 2,000 to 3,000
significant sites at <LOCATION>Willeroo</LOCATION>, but most are so sacred that
they are closed to outsiders. What the tourists do see is the
art of two ancestral beings, <PERSON>Jabiringi</PERSON> and Yagdjagbula,
otherwise known as the <ORGANIZATION>Lightning Brothers</ORGANIZATION>, whom Wardaman
believe bring the early storms and rains of the wet season.
   Later, visitors camp by a waterhole and dine on a bush
banquet prepared by <PERSON>Mr. Harney</PERSON>, who classifies himself as a
"good cook." Although one participant calls it "not so
comfortable camping," <PERSON>Mr. Harney</PERSON> says he hasn't had any
complaints. About <PERCENT>80%</PERCENT> of the tourists are from abroad
including Japanese, French, Britons, Swedes and Americans;
the rest are Australians.
   Although business has been patchy, <PERSON>Mr. Harney</PERSON> already has
plans to expand when it picks up. He wants to start a boat
tour on <PERSON>Scott Creek</PERSON> station, the sultan's adjoining property.
The area was in the news last year when the territory's drug
squad discovered an 11-acre marijuana plantation. "We didn't
like that," <PERSON>Mr. Harney</PERSON> says. (Arrests were made, including
the station's manager; police say that neither the sultan nor
the local aboriginal community was involved.)
   For the <LOCATION>Harneys</LOCATION>, tourism has turned into a family affair.
Some of his four children accompany the tours, and his wife
pitches in by washing the bus and cleaning the swags, a
bushman's sleeping bag. "I like it," <PERSON>Mr. Harney</PERSON> says of
tourism. "I like to talk to fresh people." Besides he adds,
"it's a much easier job than mustering cattle."
