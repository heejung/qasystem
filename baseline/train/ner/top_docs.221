ATLANTA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
<PERSON>Dennis Ulysees</PERSON>, 31, a stonemason from <LOCATION>Tacoma</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wash.</LOCATION>, stood in front of <ORGANIZATION>Martin 
Luther King Jr.</ORGANIZATION>'s resting place, his right arm wrapped around his daughter, 
<PERSON>Casandra</PERSON>, 10. Neither spoke for several minutes. Both just stood there gazing 
at the tomb. 
</P>
<P>
As they left, Ulysees explained he had brought his daughter to the <ORGANIZATION>Martin 
Luther King Jr</ORGANIZATION>. National Historic Site so she could learn more about the slain 
civil rights leader. "I want her to know him, to know how important he was for 
black people like us," <PERSON>Ulysees</PERSON> said. "I want her to live her life with his life 
as a model." 
</P>
<P>
A few minutes later, <PERSON>Charlene Mitchell Rogers</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION> television newscaster, 
appeared with her son, <PERSON>Jonathan</PERSON>, 8. "I came to <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> especially to visit the 
site," <PERSON>Rogers</PERSON> said. "I brought my son along because I believe it is essential 
he come here. 
</P>
<P>
"He has never known segregation," continued <PERSON>Rogers</PERSON>, 39. "He has grown up in a 
privileged environment. I want to make certain he knows who he is and where he 
came from, that this man was responsible for the freedoms he has. I don't want 
him ever to forget." 
</P>
<P>
Every day people gather here in the heart of <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>'s Sweet Auburn district to 
pay homage to <PERSON>King</PERSON>, who died <DATE>April 4, 1968</DATE>, in <LOCATION>Memphis</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Tenn.</LOCATION>, the victim of an 
assassin's bullet. But on this day, which would have been <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s <DATE>60th birthday</DATE>, 
thousands are expected to gather at the site's reflecting pool where his tomb 
is mounted on a pedestal. Inscribed on his crypt are <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s words: "Free at 
last. Free at last. Thank God Almighty I'm free at last." 
</P>
<P>
The two-block-long national historic site was set aside by <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1980</DATE> and 
has been administered since by the <ORGANIZATION>National Park Service</ORGANIZATION>. Its purpose is to 
protect and interpret for the benefit, inspiration and education of present and 
future generations the place where <PERSON>Martin Luther King Jr.</PERSON> was born, lived, 
worked and worshiped. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year 840,000 visitors came here, half black, half white," explained 
<PERSON>Randolph Scott</PERSON>, 58, a former <LOCATION>Norfolk</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Va.</LOCATION>, high school history teacher who has 
been the site's superintendent for the <DATE>last four years</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Among the site's points of interest: the home at 501 <LOCATION>Auburn Ave.</LOCATION> where <PERSON>King</PERSON> was 
born; his tomb a block away at the <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King Jr</ORGANIZATION>. Center for 
<ORGANIZATION>Non-Violent Social Change</ORGANIZATION>, founded in <DATE>1968</DATE> and headed by his wife, <PERSON>Coretta 
Scott King</PERSON>; and <ORGANIZATION>Ebenezer Baptist Church</ORGANIZATION>, located two blocks from his 
birthplace. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Like Father, Grandfather 
</P>
<P>
His father, <PERSON>Martin Luther King Sr.</PERSON>, was pastor of the church from <DATE>1931</DATE> to <DATE>1975</DATE>; 
his grandfather, <PERSON>A. D. Williams</PERSON>, presided from <DATE>1894</DATE> to <DATE>1931</DATE>. <PERSON>Martin Luther King 
Jr.</PERSON> preached his first sermon at <ORGANIZATION>Ebenezer Baptist Church</ORGANIZATION> when he was 17 and 
served as co-pastor with his father from <DATE>1960</DATE> to <DATE>1968</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
It was there that his body lay in state and also where his mother, <PERSON>Alberta 
Williams King</PERSON>, was slain <DATE>six years later</DATE> as she played the organ during a 
religious service. 
</P>
<P>
At the two-story, 14-room Queen <PERSON>Anne</PERSON> clapboard home where King was born and 
lived until <DATE>1941</DATE>, visitors are taken on a tour by ranger <PERSON>Shelly Lewis</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
"Many people say they can feel <PERSON>Dr. King</PERSON>'s spirit, feel his presence in this 
house," said <PERSON>Lewis</PERSON>, 30, of <LOCATION>Bolton</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Miss.</LOCATION> "Many visitors get quite emotional. 
They break down and cry." 
</P>
<P>
Also born there were his brother, <PERSON>A. D.</PERSON>, who drowned in a swimming pool 
accident in <DATE>1969</DATE>, and his sister, <PERSON>Christine King Farris</PERSON>, a professor at 
<LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Spelman College</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Family Belongings 
</P>
<P>
The home contains the family's original furniture, including the piano King 
played as a boy, his baseball glove, Monopoly game, family icebox and washing 
machine. 
</P>
<P>
"Sweet <PERSON>Auburn</PERSON> was a mecca of <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>'s leading black business and commercial 
enterprises and a middle-class black residential area when <PERSON>Martin Luther King</PERSON> 
lived here," site superintendent <PERSON>Scott</PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION>Park Service</ORGANIZATION> now owns 13 
turn-of-the-century homes and buildings in 21.5-acre site and plans to acquire 
27 more, he said. Seven have already been restored to their original state. 
</P>
<P>
Among the area's buildings is <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>'s famed <ORGANIZATION>Royal Peacock Club</ORGANIZATION> where <PERSON>Duke 
Ellington</PERSON>, <PERSON>Billy Eckstein</PERSON>, <PERSON>Louis Armstrong</PERSON> and other well-known black 
entertainers performed. <PERSON>John Wesley Dobbs</PERSON>, grandfather of former <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> Mayor 
<PERSON>Maynard H. Jackson</PERSON>, is credited with giving the area its nickname, Sweet 
Auburn. 
</P>
<P>
At the <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King Jr</ORGANIZATION>. Center for <ORGANIZATION>Non-Violent Social Change</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Park 
Service</ORGANIZATION> operates a museum filled with memorabilia and photographs highlighting 
the life of the civil rights leader. 
</P>
<P>
On display are the Nobel Peace Prize he received as well as the Medal of 
Freedom, his clothing, clerical robes and favorite neckties. Behind glass is 
the key to Room 307 at the <LOCATION>Lorraine Hotel</LOCATION> where King was killed, the wallet he 
was carrying when shot, his handwritten sermons and well-worn Bible. 
</P>
<P>
"What is important to my mother, my brother and my two sisters is the 
ever-growing interest in my father and what he worked for in his lifetime," 
said <PERSON>Martin Luther King III</PERSON>, 31, a <LOCATION>Fulton County</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ga.</LOCATION>, commissioner. "I hope 
and pray it will continue to grow with his memory helping to achieve justice 
and equality for all mankind."

<HEAD>King Center Confirms Resignation Of Slain Leader's Youngest Son</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   <PERSON>Dexter King</PERSON>, the youngest son of slain civil
rights leader <PERSON>Martin Luther King Jr.</PERSON>, has resigned as president of
the center named for his father, center officials confirmed
<DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   The resignation had been rumored for several days because of
apparent rifts among the leadership of the <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King Jr</ORGANIZATION>.
Center for <ORGANIZATION>Nonviolent Social Change</ORGANIZATION> over how it should be managed.
   ``We regret to announce that <PERSON>Dexter Scott King</PERSON> has resigned his
post as president,'' said a statement from <ORGANIZATION>King Center</ORGANIZATION> board
Chairman <PERSON>Jesse Hill Jr</PERSON>.
   ``It must be borne in mind that the changing circumstances,
staff and management changes and tragic assassinations have not
changed this eternal commitment to social change through creative
love and revolutionary non-violence,'' Hill added.
   Hill's statement did not elaborate on the reasons for <PERSON>Dexter
King</PERSON>'s departure, and neither he nor King immediately returned
telephone calls <DATE>Thursday</DATE> seeking comment.
   In <DATE>January</DATE>, the center's board of directors elected <PERSON>King</PERSON>, 28, to
take over the presidency from his mother, <PERSON>Coretta Scott King</PERSON>, who
remained as chief executive officer. He officially took over <DATE>April
4</DATE>, the 21st anniversary of his father's assassination.
   He was touted at the time as an ambitious young leader who
sought a vigorous role in the center, hoping to place it on a solid
financial footing and cut its dependency on donations.
   Civil rights leaders in <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> said <DATE>this week</DATE> that there has
been conflict within the center's leadership over fiscal and
personnel concerns, and there were reports of a dispute between
<PERSON>King</PERSON> and his mother.
   Mayor <PERSON>Andrew Young</PERSON>, who was an aide to the Rev. <PERSON>Martin Luther
King Jr.</PERSON> in the '60s, was quoted by <ORGANIZATION>The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution</ORGANIZATION> as saying the resignation was part of a family
dispute fueled by a generation gap.
   City Councilman <PERSON>Hosea Williams</PERSON>, who also was a King aide, said
the center recently had begun to focus more on leading the civil
rights movement, placing itself in competition with the <ORGANIZATION>Southern
Christian Leadership Conference</ORGANIZATION> founded by the elder King.
   The King Center, located on <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>'s historic <LOCATION>Auburn Avenue</LOCATION>,
once the heart of the black community's business district, contains
a museum and <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King Jr.</ORGANIZATION>'s tomb.

anniversary with a candlelight vigil and prayers, his widow, <PERSON>Coretta Scott 
King</PERSON>, gave her annual "State of the Dream" address <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, calling the civil 
rights gains her late husband inspired "fragile" and warning that "much remains 
to be done." 
</P>
<P>
At <ORGANIZATION>Boston University's School of Theology</ORGANIZATION>, where King received a doctorate 
degree in <DATE>1955</DATE>, students and teachers gathered for a <DATE>Sunday</DATE> night candlelight

<P>
President-elect <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>, returning to <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> on <DATE>Sunday</DATE> from a three-day 
<LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> fishing vacation, scheduled an address to a prayer breakfast at a

   A daughter of <PERSON>Sen. Robert F. Kennedy</PERSON> and a son of
<ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King Jr.</ORGANIZATION> helped launch a campaign against capital
punishment on <DATE>Friday</DATE>, saying the death penalty will not bring their
slain fathers back to life.
   Society should put some killers in jail ``and leave them there
forever. But while we're at it, dismantle the electric chair, the
gas chamber. They won't bring back my father, they'll only take
someone else's father,'' said <PERSON>M. Kerry Kennedy</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>, who was 8
when her father was killed in <DATE>1968</DATE>.
   Other speakers during a meeting at the <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King Jr</ORGANIZATION>.
Center for <ORGANIZATION>Nonviolent Social Change</ORGANIZATION> urged religious leaders to
become more active in mobilizing their congregations against the
death penalty.
   The campaign, called ``Lighting the Torch of Conscience,'' is
aimed at getting the religious community to confront the capital
punishment issue. It will culminate in <DATE>June 1990</DATE> with a 330-mile
pilgrimage from <LOCATION>Starke</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla.</LOCATION>, where <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>'s electric chair is
located, to <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Camille Bell</PERSON>, an <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> woman whose son Yusef, 9, was murdered
in <DATE>1979</DATE>, also spoke against capital punishment. <PERSON>Yusef Bell</PERSON> was one
of more than 20 young black Atlantans whose deaths were attributed
by police to <PERSON>Wayne Williams</PERSON>, currently serving two life prison
terms for two of the killings.
   ``I know the pain I felt when <PERSON>Yusef</PERSON> died,'' <PERSON>Ms. Bell</PERSON> told the
gathering of about 100. ``No other mother should have to feel that
pain.''
   <PERSON>Martin Luther King III</PERSON>, a son of the slain civil rights leader,
said the execution of King assassin <PERSON>James Earl Ray</PERSON> ``would not
bring my father back.''
   ``If we believe in an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth,
most of us would be without eyes and without teeth,'' he said.
   <DATE>Friday</DATE>'s session opened with <PERSON>Delbert Tibbs</PERSON>, a former <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>
death row inmate, carrying a lighted torch from <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s tomb into an
auditorium of the King center.
   Tibbs, convicted of murder and rape, spent two years on death
row before his conviction was overturned and he was freed in <DATE>1977</DATE>.
   He urged people to ``listen to and be guided by that still,
small voice from within'' to work to solve crime problems without
the death penalty.
   Sister <PERSON>Helen Prejean</PERSON> of <LOCATION>New Orleans</LOCATION>, a death row spiritual
adviser and director of the Pilgrimage for Life program in her
hometown, said she had accompanied three men to the electric chair
and watched them die.
   ``They are the fire in me that is not going to go away until
things change,'' she said.

   The youngest son of slain civil rights leader
<ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King Jr.</ORGANIZATION> has resigned as president of the center that
carries his father's name amid talk of a rift among the leadership
over the center's direction.
   <PERSON>Dexter King</PERSON>'s resignation was announced <DATE>Thursday</DATE> by the <ORGANIZATION>Martin
Luther King Jr</ORGANIZATION>. Center for <ORGANIZATION>Nonviolent Social Change</ORGANIZATION>, but no reason
was given.
   Civil rights leaders in <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> said <PERSON>King</PERSON> stepped down because
of conflicts over fiscal and personnel concerns, and there were
reports of a rift between <PERSON>King</PERSON> and his mother, <PERSON>Coretta Scott King</PERSON>.
   <LOCATION>Atlanta City</LOCATION> Councilman <PERSON>Hosea Williams</PERSON> said the center was
encroaching on the leadership position in the civil rights movement
of the <ORGANIZATION>Southern Christian Leadership Conference</ORGANIZATION>, which the elder
King founded.
   ``The center's purpose was to perpetuate the legacy of <PERSON>Dr. King</PERSON>,
but not to carry on the whole movement,'' said <PERSON>Williams</PERSON>, a former
lieutenant of the elder King. ``When they started talking about
leading the movement, freeing black folk, they started competing,
and both got hurt.''
   Mayor <PERSON>Andrew Young</PERSON>, who was an aide to the elder King in the
'60s, was quoted by <ORGANIZATION>The Atlanta Journal-Constitution</ORGANIZATION> as saying the
resignation was part of a family dispute fueled by a generation gap.
   A King Center official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity,
said <PERSON>Mrs. King</PERSON> might return to the presidency she relinquished to
her son.
   The <ORGANIZATION>King Center</ORGANIZATION> is a non-profit organization devoted to
education about <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s teachings and philosophy. It also urges
action on international racial issues, especially apartheid in
<LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>, and is host to the annual <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King Jr.</ORGANIZATION>
birthday week celebration.
   The <ORGANIZATION>SCLC</ORGANIZATION> has taken an activist approach to the problems of
poverty and racism since it was founded in <DATE>1957</DATE> by King and the
Revs. <PERSON>Joseph Lowery</PERSON>, <PERSON>Ralph Abernathy</PERSON> and <PERSON>Fred Shuttlesworth</PERSON>.
   ``We are the activist arm of the movement,'' <PERSON>Lowery</PERSON> has said.
``When you do that, you step on toes and you don't become the most
popular kid on the block.''
   The Rev. <PERSON>Jesse Jackson</PERSON>, a follower of King in the <DATE>1960s</DATE> and a
former candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, said
in a telephone interview from <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> that the two groups are
complementary rather than competitive.
   ``The fact that <PERSON>Dr. King</PERSON> remains a frame of reference for
justice is mainly that his work has been institutionalized,''
<PERSON>Jackson</PERSON> said, referring to the center.
   ``The <ORGANIZATION>SCLC</ORGANIZATION>'s legacy (is) direct action, challenging the racism,
challenging anti-semitism,'' he added.
   <PERSON>Dexter King</PERSON>, 28, was elected in <DATE>January</DATE> to take over from his
mother, who remained as chief executive officer. He said he wanted
to cut the center's dependency on donations and put it on a solid
financial base so it could ``market and disseminate'' non-violent
teachings.
   King could not be reached at the office of his business,
<ORGANIZATION>Visionary Development Corp</ORGANIZATION>.
   In a statement from the <ORGANIZATION>King Center</ORGANIZATION>, board Chairman <PERSON>Jesse Hill
Jr.</PERSON> did not address the reasons for <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s decision.
   ``It must be borne in mind that the changing circumstances,
staff and management changes and tragic assassinations have not
changed this eternal commitment to social change through creative
love and revolutionary non-violence,'' Hill wrote.
   The King Center, on <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>'s historic <LOCATION>Auburn Avenue</LOCATION>, contains a
museum and <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King Jr.</ORGANIZATION>'s tomb.

   Ringing bells and ringing speeches commemorated the legacy of the
Rev. <PERSON>Martin Luther King Jr.</PERSON> amid renewed calls to strive for the
goals of the slain civil rights leader.
   Marchers filled city streets in <LOCATION>San Franciso</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Liberty Bell</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> was symbolically tapped, and national leaders descended
on <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s hometown to join his family in <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> on the federal day
marking his 60th birthday.
   ``He lived a hero's life. He dreamed a hero's dreams,''
President-elect <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> told black leaders in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>. ``He left a
hero's indelible mark on the mind and imagination of a great
nation.''
   A unity march across the <ORGANIZATION>University of Michigan</ORGANIZATION> campus in <PERSON>Ann
Arbor</PERSON> drew about 2,000 people, who paraded as the university's
carillon played ``We Shall Overcome,'' the anthem of the civil
rights movement.
   Later <DATE>Monday</DATE>, <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON>Andrew Young</PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION>University of
Michigan</ORGANIZATION> audience that, ``The world King left is not a great deal
different.''
   ``But there seems to be an awareness that violence is not the
solution to the world's problems, as we learned in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>, as the
Russians have learned in <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION>, and as the <ORGANIZATION>PLO</ORGANIZATION> has learned.''
   Nowhere was <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s influence felt more strongly than in <LOCATION>Selma</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Ala.</LOCATION>, where he began the <DATE>1965</DATE> Selma-to-Montgomery march that helped
establish voting rights for blacks throughout the South.
   On <DATE>Monday</DATE>, three blacks were sworn in as members of the <ORGANIZATION>Dallas
County Commission</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Selma</LOCATION>. They became the first black <LOCATION>Dallas
County</LOCATION> commissioners since Reconstruction and gave the five-member
commission a black majority.
   ``We bring home to <LOCATION>Dallas County</LOCATION> the harvest of the <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther
King</ORGANIZATION> voting rights act,'' said <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> District <PERSON>Judge U. W. Clemon</PERSON>, the
first black federal judge in <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION>, who administered the oath of
office.
   King's widow, <PERSON>Corretta Scott King</PERSON>, was joined by black and white
political leaders for the annual ecumenical service at the <ORGANIZATION>Ebenezer
Baptist Church</ORGANIZATION>, where <PERSON>King</PERSON> and his father preached.
   The Rev. <PERSON>Jesse Jackson</PERSON>, once one of <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s young lieutenants,
used the occasion to criticize the <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> administration's civil
rights record and President <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>'s suggestion that civil rights
leaders bolster their position by fostering an attitude of
oppression among blacks.
   Jackson called <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>'s statements ``petty comments from the same
man who implied that <PERSON>Martin Luther King Jr.</PERSON> was a communist.''
   In <LOCATION>Pretoria</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Ambassador <PERSON>Edward Perkins</PERSON>, who is
black, marked the holiday by unveiling a bronze bust of King that
will sit in a new <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> embassay compound. The ceremony included
blacks and whites who have been prominent critics of <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>'s
system of racial separation.
   In the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, parades were held in places like <LOCATION>New
Orleans</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Honolulu</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>San Antonio</LOCATION>, where 15,000 people
marching from four directions converged on <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King Jr</ORGANIZATION>.
Plaza.
   ``I took part because <PERSON>Dr. King</PERSON>'s dream has not been fully
realized,'' said <PERSON>Elbert Winbush</PERSON>, 32, of <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, who joined
10,000 others in the <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> parade with his three daughters.
   King would have been 60 on <DATE>Sunday</DATE>. He was 39 years old when he
was shot to death by a sniper in <LOCATION>Memphis</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Tenn.</LOCATION>, on <DATE>April 4, 1968</DATE>.
   King's birthday was first celebrated as a national holiday in
<DATE>1986</DATE>, three years after <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> named the third <DATE>Monday</DATE> in <DATE>January</DATE>
as a holiday in his honor. All but six states have adopted the day
as a state holiday. The six states are <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New Hampshire</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>South Dakota</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION>.
   In <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION>, when black leaders symbolically struck the
Liberty Bell as a signal for bells to ring nationwide, Mayor <PERSON>W.
Wilson Goode</PERSON> cited the bell's famous crack.
   ``That crack is a symbol that there are some things
unfulfilled,'' <PERSON>Goode</PERSON> said.
   At the <ORGANIZATION>Michigan Capitol</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Lansing</LOCATION>, children struck the state's
replica of the <ORGANIZATION>Liberty Bell</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``He was a great man and he believed in what he was doing. He
tried to bring peace between all kinds of people,'' said <PERSON>Sharonda
Gardenhire</PERSON>, 10, of <LOCATION>Lansing</LOCATION>, shortly after she gave the rope a tug.
   A speech by one of <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s sons in <LOCATION>Eugene</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ore.</LOCATION>, was delayed for
about an hour after two telephoned bomb threats. The observance
resumed after the building was search and no bomb was found.
   <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King III</ORGANIZATION> said that in the 21 years since his father
was assassinated ``this nation has made great strides.'' But he
added that, ``I've got news for you. We've still got a long way to
do.''

   Worshipers at <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King Jr.</ORGANIZATION>'s church
were urged today on the slain civil rights leader's birthday to
keep alive his memory and his philosophy of non-violence.
   ``This is a man who is a deep current in our memory,'' said the
Rev. <PERSON>Cecil Williams</PERSON>, pastor of <ORGANIZATION>Glide Memorial United Methodist
Church</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>. ``Let us live then not only his dream, but
let us live the practice of non-violence and unconditional love.''
   Williams spoke at the annual ecumenical service at <ORGANIZATION>Ebenezer
Baptist Church</ORGANIZATION>.
   Church services, parades, and other celebrations were held
nationwide during the weekend before the federal holiday, which for
the first time falls on the slain civil-rights leader's actual
birthday.
   He would have been 61 today.
   Also planned today in <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> was a ``March of Celebration''
parade, being televised nationally for the first time.
   A former King lieutenant, the Rev. <PERSON>Hosea Williams</PERSON>, stood in
front of an <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> housing project to criticize the day's
activities for making a travesty of <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s dream of equality and
justice.
   Williams, <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s field organizer in the civil rights movement,
complained that people were starving in the city while thousands of
dollars were being spent on the parade. ``I am really upset with
all this gaiety,'' he said.
   This year's holiday follows a series of bombings and threats,
apparently racially motivated, in the Southeast, and a flareup of
racial tensions in <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> after an apparent hoax in which a white
man had claimed a black mugger fatally shot his pregnant wife.
   It also comes at a time of gains for blacks _ the election of
<PERSON>David Dinkins</PERSON>, first black mayor of <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION>, and the nation's
first elected black governor, <PERSON>L. Douglas Wilder</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION>.
   ``Today, the sound of libery is being heard all around the
world,'' said <PERSON>James Farmer</PERSON>, founder of the <ORGANIZATION>Congress for Racial
Equality</ORGANIZATION>, as he pounded three times with his fist on the <ORGANIZATION>Liberty
Bell</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION>. ``Those who have been denied liberty love it
most. Dr. King loved liberty and he fought and died for it.''
   The <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> held a moment of silence at noon.
   In <LOCATION>New Hampshire</LOCATION>, one of just four states without some form of
King holiday, about 200 <ORGANIZATION>Merrimack Valley High School</ORGANIZATION> pupils walked
out of morning classes today in <LOCATION>Concord</LOCATION> to recognize <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther
King Day</ORGANIZATION>, which the school does not observe.
   ``This is our own personal way of remembering him,'' said senior
<PERSON>Mike Krumenacker</PERSON>, one of three pupils who organized the impromptu
gathering of about a third of the school's pupils.
   And in another of the four states, <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>, thousands marched in
<LOCATION>Phoenix</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Tucson</LOCATION> today to honor King. A racially mixed crowd
carried black balloons along a four-mile stretch of downtown
<LOCATION>Phoenix</LOCATION> as they headed for a rally at the state Capitol.
   King, the son of an <LOCATION>Atlanta Baptist</LOCATION> minister, led non-violent
marches in the South in the <DATE>1950s</DATE> and <DATE>1960s</DATE> in a quest to end
discrimination against blacks and other minorities. He was
assassinated on <DATE>April 4, 1968</DATE>, in <LOCATION>Memphis</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Tenn</LOCATION>.
   On <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, <PERSON>Coretta Scott King</PERSON> delivered her annual ``state of
the dream'' address at <ORGANIZATION>Ebenezer Baptist Church</ORGANIZATION>.
   King's widow applauded pro-democracy shifts worldwide and said
the civil rights movement would not be deterred by the recent wave
of bombings and threats against blacks. A federal judge and a black
<LOCATION>Savannah</LOCATION> lawyer were killed in two bombings.
   ``In the <DATE>last year</DATE>, we've seen hundreds of thousands of people
marching through the streets of <LOCATION>Berlin</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Budapest</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Pretoria</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Warsaw</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Prague</LOCATION>, all singing `We Shall
Overcome' in a host of languages,'' she said.
   ``We're not going to be turned around by letter bombs or threats
or any kind of violence,'' she said. ``Instead, we're going
forward, with unity and courage and commitment.''
   Also in <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>, more than 500 students and teachers at <ORGANIZATION>Booker
T. Washington High School</ORGANIZATION> joined civil rights leader <PERSON>Rosa Parks</PERSON> to
paint a mural dedicated to King. The mural displayed, ``Let Freedom
Ring.''
   In <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>, where blacks have complained about aggressive police
tactics in their search for the killer of a pregnant white woman in
<DATE>October</DATE>, about 25 activists planned to demonstrate at a King
memorial breakfast today to protest the presence of Mayor <PERSON>Raymond
Flynn</PERSON>.
   Tensions have been heightened after revelations that <PERSON>Charles
Stuart</PERSON> himself probably killed his wife. He committed suicide this
month.
   ``We don't feel Mayor <PERSON>Flynn</PERSON> should have a seat of honor at this
occasion,'' said <PERSON>Sadiki Kambon</PERSON>, director of a group called the
<ORGANIZATION>Community for Human Rights</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``The mayor came on the scene that (<DATE>October</DATE>) <TIME>night</TIME> and was told
by police that an African male killed a white female,'' <PERSON>Kambon</PERSON>
said. ``The mandate was `Get me someone,' and the police proceeded
to roust black males in <LOCATION>Mission Hill</LOCATION> and the entire city.''
   In <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Dinkins</PERSON> told about 400 people at <ORGANIZATION>Judson Memorial
Church</ORGANIZATION> that ``<PERSON>Dr. King</PERSON> took us to the dawn of a new era. It is up
to us to push on into the bright light of day.''
   Wilder, sworn in <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, said on ABC-TV's ``This Week With
<PERSON>David Brinkley</PERSON>'' on <DATE>Sunday</DATE> that a black could occupy the <ORGANIZATION>White
House</ORGANIZATION> ``in our time.''
   In <LOCATION>Seattle</LOCATION>, the Rev. <PERSON>Joseph Lowery</PERSON>, president and co-founder of
the <ORGANIZATION>Southern Christian Leadership Conference</ORGANIZATION>, addressed 900 people
<DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>.
   ``Don't let them make a pious dreamer out of him,'' <PERSON>Lowery</PERSON> said.
``He was a non-violent revolutionary. ... The spirit of <ORGANIZATION>Martin
Luther King</ORGANIZATION> demands that we be activists.''
   Federal offices were closed today, and most states gave the day
off to their workers as well. The four without any form of King
holiday are <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New Hampshire</LOCATION>, but some
other states kept workers on the job but marked the day in some
other way.

<HEAD>Deputy Assigned to Provide Security for King Family</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A deputy has been assigned to provide security
for the family of <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King Jr.</ORGANIZATION> for the past five months,
a measure defended by the county sheriff as a valid use of tax
money.
   ``I'd say it's public money going to protect a public family,''
<LOCATION>Fulton County</LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON>Richard Lankford</PERSON> was quoted as saying in
today's editions of The <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> Constitution. ``Anything that
happened to the <PERSON>King</PERSON> family at this juncture would become
international.''
   King was assassinated <DATE>April 4, 1968</DATE>, in <LOCATION>Memphis</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Tenn</LOCATION>. His
mother, <PERSON>Alberta King</PERSON>, was shot to death in <DATE>1975</DATE> while playing the
organ for a <DATE>Sunday</DATE> service in an <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> church.
   ``It would be an indictment, I think, against our community if
another tragedy would befall the family,'' the sheriff said in
acknowledging he assigned deputy <PERSON>Angelo Willoughby</PERSON> to the post.
   The newspaper said it learned of the deputy's hiring through
county records.
   County Manager <PERSON>Sam Brownlee</PERSON> said the county commission should
have been asked to approve the assignment because it amounts to
publicly financed protection for a private family.
   ``That is not something the <ORGANIZATION>Board of Commissioners</ORGANIZATION> has
authorized,'' he said. ``That's something the sheriff has done.''
   Willoughby reports daily to the <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King Jr</ORGANIZATION>. Center
for Non-violent Social Change.
   ``I don't know if I would say he's a bodyguard, but he's there
for the protection of the family as well as for the security of the
center itself,'' <PERSON>Lankford</PERSON> said.
   The civil rights leader's son, <ORGANIZATION>Fulton County Commissioner Martin
Luther King III</ORGANIZATION>, said he appreciates the officer's presence.
   ``I carry the name <PERSON>Martin Luther King</PERSON> and that draws
crackpots,'' he said.
   ``A guy came up and approached my mother (<ORGANIZATION>Coretta Scott King</ORGANIZATION>)
last week,'' <PERSON>King</PERSON> said. ``He was just crazy. If he (<PERSON>Willoughby</PERSON>) had
not been there, something might have happened. Once he saw a police
official there, he backed off.''

Carolina</LOCATION> and racist graffiti was sprayed on signs on a <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>
highway named after King.
   King's survivors and others remembering him in services around
the nation said they harbored no illusions that his work was
finished.
   ``It's great that we celebrate his birthday but this day should
be a day where we recommit ourselves to finishing his dream,''
<PERSON>King</PERSON>'s son, <PERSON>Martin Luther King 3rd</PERSON>, who was 10 when his father died
in <DATE>1968</DATE>, told 500 people at a <ORGANIZATION>DePaul University</ORGANIZATION> church after
leading a candlelight march <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>.
   King's widow, <PERSON>Coretta Scott King</PERSON>, spoke in <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> at an annual
ecumenical service at <LOCATION>Ebenezer Baptist Church</LOCATION>, where her husband
delivered some of his most stirring orations.
   ``Now is the time to organize a global non-violent movement
based on <PERSON>Dr. King</PERSON>'s teachings, to put an end to the scourges of
poverty, hunger, racism and bigotry, war and militarism,'' she said.
   Security for the service was heavy following recent racially
motivated mail bombings in the Southeast. Bomb-sniffing dogs
inspected the church beforehand; visitors were required for the
first time to pass through metal detectors, and police took up
posts throughout the church during the service.
   Security also was heavy for a <DATE>March</DATE> of Celebration held later in
downtown <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>. Police estimated 400,000 people watched.
   A former top King lieutenant, the Rev. <PERSON>Hosea Williams</PERSON>,
complained that the parade trivialized the day and wasted money
better spent on the poor. ``This has been prostituted more than any
other holiday except Jesus Christ's birthday,'' he said outside an
<LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> housing project.
   About 25,000 people lined <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>' streets for the fifth
annual King Birthday Celebration Parade down a boulevard named for
him, and 2,500 turned out for an annual breakfast in <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>. In
<LOCATION>Memphis</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Tenn.</LOCATION>, about 300 people gathered at The <PERSON>Lorraine Motel</PERSON>,
where King was assassinated on <DATE>April 4, 1968</DATE>.
   ``We didn't want the children to think that <PERSON>Martin Luther King</PERSON>'s
birthday was just another day for watching television,'' said
<PERSON>Mardest Van Hooks</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Memphis</LOCATION> teacher who helped bring a group of
youngsters to The <PERSON>Lorraine</PERSON>.
   The Washington-based <ORGANIZATION>Federal Holiday Commission</ORGANIZATION> said bells
chimed at <TIME>12:30 p.m.</TIME> EST in all 50 states and 144 countries. The
<ORGANIZATION>Liberty Bell</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> was tapped three times. The <ORGANIZATION>New York
Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> paused for a moment at noon.
   The holiday, first celebrated in <DATE>1986</DATE>, fell on <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s actual
birthday for the first time.
   In <LOCATION>New Hampshire</LOCATION>, one of four states without any form of King
holiday, students at high schools in <LOCATION>Concord</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Milford</LOCATION>, Merrimack
and <LOCATION>Wolfeboro</LOCATION> staged protest rallies.
   ``<PERSON>Martin Luther King</PERSON> wasn't just for black people. He changed
everything for everyone, not just black people,'' <ORGANIZATION>Merrimack Valley
High</ORGANIZATION> senior <PERSON>John Morin</PERSON>, who is white, told fellow students.
   In <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>, where the King holiday has long been a bitter
controversy, a <LOCATION>Phoenix</LOCATION> crowd estimated at nearly 15,000 heard
lawmakers and community leaders at the Capitol urge them to vote in
a referendum this <DATE>fall</DATE> over whether to let a King Day observance
become law.
   A bill to make the day a holiday was introduced <DATE>Monday</DATE> in the
<ORGANIZATION>Idaho Senate</ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> also has no form of King Holiday, while some
other states keep workers on the job but mark the day in other ways.
   About 200 people protested outside a bank in <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>, that
stayed open. <PERSON>Norman Eenith</PERSON>, 35, held an outstretched dollar bill
and said, ``This is what it's all about.''
   In <LOCATION>New Orleans</LOCATION>, following a parade in King's honor attended by
tens of thousands, two whites were arrested after a fight in which
a black man was hit with nail-studded boards, officials said.
   At <ORGANIZATION>Garrett High School</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Charleston</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>S.C.</LOCATION>, one of several area
schools that canceled the day off to make up for days lost during
Hurricane Hugo, about five black students angry at having to attend
school on the holiday assaulted two white students, Principal <PERSON>Rex
Whitcomb</PERSON> said. Police helped restore order.
   In <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>, two signs on 10-mile stretch of highway named for
King were painted with swastikas and the letters ``SWP,'' thought
to stand for ``Supreme White Power,'' police said.
   In <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, a county commissioner said he received numerous
telephone threats after he protested a newspaper advertisement
depicting <PERSON>King</PERSON>, a birthday cake and a garbage truck. The ad said
trash would be picked up as usual <DATE>Monday</DATE>.
   ``All of a sudden I recognized that I felt a particular fear
that as a young white man, fairly protected growing up, I had never
felt before _ what so many people in this group must have felt,''
<PERSON>Yordon</PERSON> said.

   Worshippers filling the Rev. <PERSON>Martin Luther King
Jr.</PERSON>'s church were admonished today to remember the slain civil
rights leader's birthday by rededicating themselves to his work.
   ``It is our hope and our desire ... that we will realize it is an
unending quest,'' said the Rev. <PERSON>Joseph Roberts</PERSON>, pastor of <ORGANIZATION>Ebenezer
Baptist Church</ORGANIZATION>, where <PERSON>King</PERSON> and his father preached.
   Roberts opened the annual ecumenical service that attracted
local, state and federal officials to mark the national holiday
honoring King. Among those gathered on the podium were members of
<PERSON>King</PERSON>'s family, the Rev. <PERSON>Jesse Jackson</PERSON>, <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON>Dick
Thornburgh</PERSON>, actress <PERSON>Jane Fonda</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON>Joe Frank Harris</PERSON> and
the state's senators and congressmen.
   Thornburgh called King ``a martyr slain in his prime while trying
to make <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> and the world a place where justice, freedom and
peace could flourish.''
   President-elect <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON> sent a letter to be read at the
service, in which he pledged that his administration ``will work
tirelessly for the strict enforcement of civil rights as well as for
absolute equality for all Americans.''
   In <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> commemorated the holiday with a glowing
tribute to King in a speech to about 300 prominent blacks.
   ``He lived a hero's life. He dreamed a hero's dreams. He left a
hero's indelible mark on the mind and imagination of a great
nation,'' <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> told members of the <ORGANIZATION>Inaugural Afro-American Committee</ORGANIZATION>.
   Looking ahead to his inauguration on <DATE>Friday</DATE>, <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> said: ``What
becomes of <PERSON>Martin Luther King</PERSON>'s dreams is up to us. We must not fail
him. We must not fail ourselves.''
   In <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Ambassador <PERSON>Edward Perkins</PERSON> marked the
holiday by unveiling a bronze bust of King on a bushy plot of land
in <LOCATION>Pretoria</LOCATION> where the new <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> embassy is to stand.
   In <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON>Michael Dukakis</PERSON> invoked <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s
memory when he announced an executive order that will bar the state
from buying goods and services from companies that have dealings
with the South African government.
   In <LOCATION>Groton</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Conn.</LOCATION>, 51 demonstrators were arrested on charges of
disorderly conduct at the <ORGANIZATION>Electric</ORGANIZATION> Boat shipyard as they protested
the construction of Trident nuclear submarines. The demonstrators,
many carrying pictures of King and citing his belief in non-violent
protest, said the demonstration was held in observance of his
birthday.
   Elsewhere around the nation, planned observances of the King
holiday included the swearing-in of the first blacks on the <LOCATION>Dallas
County</LOCATION> (<LOCATION>Ala.</LOCATION>) Commission in more than a century. The ceremony was
scheduled for <LOCATION>Selma</LOCATION>, where King began the <DATE>1965</DATE> Selma-to-Montgomery
march that resulted in passage of the Voting Rights Act.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Liberty Bell</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> was to be symbolically tapped
today and church and school bells were being rung in <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>.
Golfers were to tee off in a suburban <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> tournament
benefiting King's <ORGANIZATION>Southern Christian Leadership Conference</ORGANIZATION>.
   The observance at <ORGANIZATION>Ebenezer Baptist Church</ORGANIZATION> capped a week of
remembrance in <LOCATION>King</LOCATION>'s hometown. At the church <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s widow
urged <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> to hold true to his call for ``a kinder, gentler nation''
and to impose strict sanctions against <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>.
   In addition, <PERSON>Coretta Scott King</PERSON> said in her annual ``State of the
Dream'' speech, the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> must do more by ``providing
education and economic assistance directly to black <LOCATION>South Africans</LOCATION>
who bear the brunt of suffering in that troubled land.''
   ``I think we ought to take the president-elect at his word and
hold him to his call for a kinder, gentler nation where peace and
justice are in fact a reality,'' she said. ``But a kinder, gentler
nation will require kinder, gentler leaders.''
   <PERSON>Mrs. King</PERSON> spoke before an estimated 1,200 people at the church
where <PERSON>King</PERSON> and his father were co-pastors. It may have been her
final ``State of the Dream'' address as president of <ORGANIZATION>The King
Center</ORGANIZATION>, a memorial and policy center in <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>.
   On <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, she announced that her 27-year-old son, <PERSON>Dexter Scott
King</PERSON>, would assume the presidency <DATE>April 4</DATE> _ the 21st anniversary of
<PERSON>King</PERSON>'s assassination at a <LOCATION>Memphis</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Tenn.</LOCATION>, motel in <DATE>1968</DATE>.
   Today is the fourth year for the King national holiday. In <DATE>1983</DATE>,
after considerable debate, <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> named the third <DATE>Monday</DATE> in
<DATE>January</DATE> as a national holiday honoring King, whose actual birthday
was <DATE>Sunday</DATE>.
   Most states also observe <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King Jr</ORGANIZATION>. Day as a state
holiday. Among the few that don't is <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>, where rallies were
planned in <LOCATION>Phoenix</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Tucson</LOCATION> and where prospects are uncertain for
a measure that lawmakers plan to introduce this year.

<LEADPARA>  Remembering Martin Luther King Jr. and his commitment to peace was high on the

San Jose this morning.;    "I'm coming to honor what Martin Luther King
represented," said Neil Cossman, 48, of San Jose, as he waited for the train

<TEXT>     "Until you end war, you won't end poverty, and until you end poverty, you

represented are being set back by war in <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION>.";    He added, "Every time a

many other lives lost to poverty, in addition to the tragedy of the loss of
the pilot's life.";    <PERSON>Dr. Amos Brown</PERSON>, pastor of the <ORGANIZATION>Third Baptist Church</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> and chairman for that city's program today, was in <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION> to
ride the train.;    <PERSON>Brown</PERSON> saw definite parallels between <PERSON>King</PERSON> and the war in
the <LOCATION>Middle East.</LOCATION>;    "King was a non-violent prophet-philosopher who took a
stand calling for the end of the <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> War, even when it was unpopular to do
so," <PERSON>Brown</PERSON> recalled. "I often heard him say it would have been morally
inconsistent for him to talk about freedom and justice for blacks and not be
concerned about lives in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>.";    He believes the slain civil rights
leader "would have said we should have gone to the conference table to
negotiate a settlement. He would have raised some serious questions regarding
the fairness and justice of 25 to <PERCENT>30 percent</PERCENT> of the men and women in the
<LOCATION>Persian Gulf</LOCATION> being black or other minorities. He would have seen this as a
fallout of racism and injustice in our nation.";    In <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> <DATE>today</DATE>,
several hundred people gathered in a poor neighborhood in a march to
commemorate <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s birthday.;    Participants carried placards that read
"There has got to be a way to connect the human race," and other slogans
reminiscent of the slain civil rights leader's non-violent philosophy.;    "We
have come to Bayview-Hunters Point to affirm peace in our society and to deal
with our domestic problems -- drugs and violence," said the Rev. <PERSON>Cecil
Williams</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Glide Memorial United Methodist Church.</ORGANIZATION>;    "This is an
affirmation of what <PERSON>Martin Luther King</PERSON> preached -- pro-peace, not anti-war,"
he said. "We want to live peace. We want to stop the war.";    In <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> on
<DATE>Sunday</DATE>, <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s widow, <PERSON>Coretta Scott King</PERSON> and others observing the civil rights
leader's birthday remembered him as an advocate of non-violence and urged an
immediate halt to the <LOCATION>Persian Gulf</LOCATION> war.;    "Our most urgent short-term
priority at the international level is a cease-fire in the <LOCATION>Persian Gulf</LOCATION>,"
<PERSON>Coretta King</PERSON> said in her annual State of the Dream speech <DATE>Sunday</DATE> at <LOCATION>Ebenezer

war.";    Today's holiday winds up 10 days of celebrations marking <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s
birthday. Assassinated in <DATE>1968</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>King</ORGANIZATION> would have turned 62 on <DATE>Jan. 15</DATE>. The

Afro-Americans.";    <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON> noted that a large percentage of blacks are
serving with the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> military in the <LOCATION>Persian Gulf.</LOCATION>;    A rally honoring King

<TEXT>
   <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION>'s joint celebration <DATE>Monday</DATE> of the
birthdays of two Confederate generals and a black civil rights
leader on Lee-Jackson-King Day is ``the perfect combination of
diversity,'' says the man responsible for the merger.
   Lt. Gov. <PERSON>L. Douglas Wilder</PERSON>, who as a state senator five years ago
pushed through the bill making <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King Jr</ORGANIZATION>. Day a <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION>
holiday, says he doesn't find it ironic that King shares the holiday
with <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> natives <PERSON>Robert E. Lee</PERSON> and <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON> ``Stonewall'' <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON>.
   ``I find no irony in it at all,'' <PERSON>Wilder</PERSON>, a grandson of slaves
and the first black elected to statewide office in the South since
Reconstruction, said <DATE>Friday</DATE>. ``It shows we are prepared to recognize
good men. Men of principle have differed on principle and I think
all three were men of principle.''
   <PERSON>James Farmer</PERSON>, a civil rights leader who worked with <PERSON>King</PERSON>, said
<DATE>Saturday</DATE> that <PERSON>King</PERSON> deserves a day all his own because ``<PERSON>Martin
Luther King</PERSON> stood alone as a giant.''
   But he said <PERSON>King</PERSON> would have been amused at being linked with
heroes of the Confederacy.
   ``<PERSON>Dr. King</PERSON> was very tolerant of things like that,'' Farmer said.
``If he is looking down from heaven now I can hear him laughing.''
   The bill passed the state legislature in <DATE>1984</DATE> after seven years
of effort by <PERSON>Wilder</PERSON> and often acrimonious debate in public hearings.
   Opponents objected to honoring a non-Virginian with a holiday
when favorite sons such as <PERSON>Thomas Jefferson</PERSON> and <PERSON>Patrick Henry</PERSON> did
not have their own days. Celebrating <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s birthday on the third
<DATE>Monday</DATE> in <DATE>January</DATE>, already designated as Lee-Jackson Day, also drew
protest.
   King's birthday is <DATE>Jan. 15, 1929</DATE>. Lee was born <DATE>Jan. 19, 1807</DATE> and
<PERSON>Jackson</PERSON> was born <DATE>Jan. 21, 1824</DATE>.
   ``The memory of Lee and <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON> is sacred to the hearts of all
true Virginians. To replace our heroes with <PERSON>Martin Luther King</PERSON> or
any other non-Virginian is to betray the greatness of our heritage
as a commonwealth,'' Forest <PERSON>Tucker</PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION>Sons of
Confederate Veterans</ORGANIZATION>, said in <DATE>1984</DATE>.
   But <PERSON>Wilder</PERSON> persisted. ``I have never taken to the floor of the
<ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> to say one word against <PERSON>Stonewall Jackson</PERSON>,'' he told his
fellow legislators five years ago. ``I have never failed to stand in
honor of <PERSON>Robert E. Lee</PERSON>. But that cause which is sacred to many
Virginians is not sacred to all Virginians.''
   <PERSON>Wilder</PERSON>, who is expected to announce his candidacy for governor
this month, now minimizes the controversy over the bill, pointing
instead to ceremonies around the state honoring King. In <LOCATION>Richmond</LOCATION>,
for example, a week of activities is being devoted in memory of the
slain civil rights leader, including forums, worship services and a
touring stage show performing works by black writers.
   <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King Jr</ORGANIZATION>. Day is a state holiday in all states
except <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New Hampshire</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>South Dakota</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION>. Mississippians honor both <PERSON>Lee</PERSON>'s and <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s birthdays on the
same day.
   <PERSON>Charles Sadler</PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King Federal
Holiday Commission</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION>, said his group doesn't mind
how <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s birthday is celebrated, as long as it is. A joint holiday
is ``better than nothing,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   The <ORGANIZATION>Idaho House</ORGANIZATION> approved legislation
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE> to make <LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION> the 47th state with a holiday honoring
slain civil rights leader <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King Jr</ORGANIZATION>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> voted 53-27 for the bill previously passed by the
<ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>. Later, the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> accepted a <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> amendment that made the
holiday's complete name ``Martin Luther King Jr.-Idaho Human Rights
Day.''
   Final approval by the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> was expected <DATE>Thursday</DATE> before the
bill goes to Gov. <PERSON>Cecil Andrus</PERSON>, who proposed the holiday.
   The bill was the subject of tortuous arguments in the
legislature last week. Opponents said their constituents didn't
care about <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``We're told this isn't a black holiday, but yet we're also told
we can't change the name,'' said Rep. <PERSON>Stan Hawkins</PERSON>, a Republican.
``If you really have a guilt trip in mind by passing this, you're
making a mistake.''
   Rep. <PERSON>L. Ed Brown</PERSON>, also a Republican and one of the bill's
sponsors, said the decision on the bill would ``say more about
<LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION> than .. about <PERSON>Martin Luther King</PERSON>.''
   ``<LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION> is not the state in the <LOCATION>Union</LOCATION> that's going to determine
<PERSON>Martin Luther King</PERSON>'s greatness,'' <PERSON>Brown</PERSON> said. ``Forty-six states
and the federal government have already done that.''
   <PERSON>Brown</PERSON> said adopting a King holiday would ``send a very special
message to future generations about how Idahoans feel about
minorities.''
   Besides <LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION>, only <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New Hampshire</LOCATION> have not
adopted state holidays corresponding with the federal holiday
honoring King on the third <DATE>Monday</DATE> in <DATE>January</DATE>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Idaho Legislature</ORGANIZATION> created a state commemorative day in <DATE>1987</DATE>,
and a bill creating a state holiday died in a <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> committee last
year despite arguments its failure would only reinforce the
perception some have of <LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION> as a haven for racists.
   Opponents said they objected to another day off for government
employees. Proponents said <LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION>'s economy would suffer through
lost tourism and convention business if it failed to establish the
holiday.

Jr</ORGANIZATION>. Center from the civil rights leader's widow, <PERSON>Coretta Scott King</PERSON>.
   Earlier, <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON>, his wife, <PERSON>Kitty</PERSON>, and adviser <PERSON>Paul Brountas</PERSON> had
breakfast in the candidate's hotel suite with <ORGANIZATION>AFL-CIO</ORGANIZATION> president
<PERSON>Lane Kirkland</PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON>Irena</PERSON>.
   <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON>' aides, sensitive to accusations that labor wields too
much influence in the Democratic Party, did not list the breakfast
session on his schedule.
   An <ORGANIZATION>AFL-CIO</ORGANIZATION> spokesman called the breakfast ``routine.''
   ``I'm sure what they talked about was how to win in <DATE>November</DATE>,''
said federation spokesman <PERSON>Rex Hardesty</PERSON>.
   <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON> was spending most of the day in his suite working with
speechwriter <PERSON>Bill Woodward</PERSON> on the address he will deliver <DATE>Thursday</DATE>
when he accepts the presidential nomination.
   He met for nearly an hour with the Democrats' Hispanic members
of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>, a meeting they said <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON> asked for. Rep. <PERSON>Albert
Bustamante</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> said they talked about involving Hispanics in
the campaign and in the transition team, if <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON> is elected.
   ``He wanted to establish a dialogue with the leadership of the
Hispanic community in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON>Bustamante</PERSON>. ``We were real
pleased.''
   While the convention wound up its debate on the platform,
<PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON> attended a closed fund-raiser in a downtown office
building. Accompanying the <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION> governor was his cousin,
Academy Award-winning actress <PERSON>Olympia Dukakis</PERSON>.
   The last threat to convention unity was resolved earlier in the
day with announcement that aides to <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jesse Jackson</PERSON> had
reached agreement on most platform differences.
   With <PERSON>Mrs. King</PERSON> leading the way, <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON> and <PERSON>Bentsen</PERSON> and their
wives looked at exhibits at the <ORGANIZATION>King Center</ORGANIZATION>.
   The first one they stopped at contained mementos of the passage
of legislation establishing a national holiday commemorating <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s
birthday, <DATE>Jan. 15</DATE>.
   One of the exhibits was a photograph of President <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> signing
the legislation. It included an inscription, ``To Coretta King.
With respect and high esteem on a very special day.'' It was
signed, ``<PERSON>George Bush</PERSON>.''
   The Republican vice president is <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON>' certain opponent in
the fall election.
   Other exhibits included the key to Room 307 at the <PERSON>Lorraine
Motel</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Memphis</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Tenn</LOCATION>. King was standing on the balcony outside
that room when he was shot and killed in <DATE>1968</DATE>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Nobel Peace Prize</ORGANIZATION>, awarded to King, as well as the
Presidential Medal of Freedom, awarded him posthumously, also were
displayed.
   The final stop on the tour was <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s tomb, inscribed, ``Rev.
<PERSON>Martin Luther King Jr.</PERSON> <DATE>1929</DATE> - <DATE>1968</DATE>. Free at last, Free at last,
<ORGANIZATION>Thank God</ORGANIZATION> almighty I'm free at last.''
   In a brief speech that included several quotations from <LOCATION>King</LOCATION>,
<PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON> described the slain civil rights leader as ``a man of
action, he was a man of inspiration.''
   <PERSON>Bentsen</PERSON> was nearby, and <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON> said that if elected he and his
vice president ``are going to do our very best, with your support,
to inspire and uplift this country.''
   Dukakis praised the convention keynote speech by <ORGANIZATION>Texas State</ORGANIZATION>
Treasurer <PERSON>Ann Richards</PERSON> and noted that neither he nor <PERSON>Bentsen</PERSON> ``have
ever won any blue ribbons for great oratory.''
   Then he added, ``And after <PERSON>Jesse</PERSON> gets through tonight, none of
us will meet the standard <PERSON>Ann Richards</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jesse Jackson</PERSON> set for
this convention.''
   <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON> was the featured convention speaker <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>.

CALIFORNIA 94 RENAMED TO HONOR MARTIN LUTHER KING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 10-mile stretch of <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> 94, from downtown <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> to its interchange 
with <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> 125 in <LOCATION>La Mesa</LOCATION>, was formally christened <DATE>Monday</DATE> as the <ORGANIZATION>Martin 
Luther King Jr</ORGANIZATION>. Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Four green-and-white signs, each 14 feet long by 3 1/2 feet wide, along the 
state route were unveiled <DATE>Monday</DATE> at a press conference officially acknowledging 
the name change, <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>'s latest effort to find a permanent memorial for the 
slain civil-rights leader. 
</P>
<P>
For two years, the memorial issue has thrust the city in a racially and 
politically divisive debate. The renaming of the freeway has been one of the 
least favorite choices of <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>'s black community. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. <PERSON>George Stevens</PERSON>, a black community leader who has fought to have the 
<ORGANIZATION>San Diego Convention Center</ORGANIZATION> named for King, said at the unveiling that, 
although he supports renaming the freeway, he isn't satisfied, and that <LOCATION>San 
Diego</LOCATION> must still deal with what he called racism and oppression. 
</P>
<P>
In <DATE>April, 1986</DATE>, the <LOCATION>San Diego City Council</LOCATION> decided against seeking a name 
change for <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> 94 and instead voted to designate Market Street as <ORGANIZATION>Martin 
Luther King Way</ORGANIZATION>. But, a year later, <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> voters rescinded that decision by 
overwhelmingly approving a referendum that restored Market Street. 
</P>
<P>
In the aftermath, a private group, led by members of the <ORGANIZATION>Chamber of Commerce</ORGANIZATION>, 
worked with black leaders to find another replacement, settling on a 
scholarship fund and King statue to be built in <LOCATION>Balboa Park</LOCATION>. Fund raising for 
the <MONEY>$750,000</MONEY> goal has stalled at about <MONEY>$150,000</MONEY>, civic leaders said recently. 
</P>
<P>
Also attempting to move ahead was the <ORGANIZATION>City Council</ORGANIZATION>, which called on the <ORGANIZATION>Board 
of Port Commissioners</ORGANIZATION> to name the new convention center in <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s honor, a 
recommendation pushed by the <ORGANIZATION>King Tribute Advisory Board</ORGANIZATION>. The group held a 
series of eight poorly attended public hearings before voting on its 
recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
By <DATE>last July</DATE>, the port board decided by a 4-3 vote to keep <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s name off the 
center, which opens to the public <DATE>Friday</DATE> as the <ORGANIZATION>San Diego Convention Center</ORGANIZATION>. A 
Stevens-led group has promised to protest and picket the opening ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
It was after that vote that Assemblyman <PERSON>Pete Chacon</PERSON> (D-San Diego) and state 
<PERSON>Sen. Wadie P. Deddeh</PERSON> (D-Chula Vista) introduced a resolution asking the 
Legislature to rename <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> 94. The Legislature approved the request in 
<DATE>September</DATE>, specifying, however, that private donations be used to pay for the 
new signs. 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King Jr</ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION>Freeway Committee</ORGANIZATION> was formed to raise the money. Its 
chairman is Bishop <PERSON>George McKinney</PERSON>, pastor of <ORGANIZATION>St. Stephen's Church of God</ORGANIZATION> in 
<LOCATION>Christ</LOCATION> on Imperial Avenue. Sharing the leadership of the group are <PERSON>Gordon C. 
Luce</PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Great American Bank</ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON>Kim Fletcher</PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION>HomeFed Bank</ORGANIZATION>, 
and <PERSON>Deddeh</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
The group has raised <MONEY>$1,400</MONEY> of the <MONEY>$2,700</MONEY> needed for the signs, according to a 
committee spokeswoman.

<TEXT>
   The civil rights coalition <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King Jr.</ORGANIZATION>
put together more than three decades ago was having a foot-stompin'
good time in <LOCATION>Ebenezer Baptist Church</LOCATION> <DATE>last week</DATE>.
   Marchers from the movement's high time swayed and clapped to
gospel music. Movement royalty _ <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s widow, sister and three of
his children _ were on hand for festivities that lasted until
midnight.
   But one person was noticeably absent: <PERSON>Dexter Scott King</PERSON>.
   He called himself ``the son of a son of a movement'' when he
became president of his father's memorial center, but left the
center in a huff <DATE>four months later</DATE> amid a reported power struggle
with his mother, <PERSON>Coretta Scott King</PERSON>.
   King, 28, the youngest son, has kept a low profile since his
resignation <DATE>Aug. 4</DATE> from the <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King Jr</ORGANIZATION>. Center for
<ORGANIZATION>Nonviolent Social Change</ORGANIZATION>. Neigher he nor his mother responded to
repeated requests for interviews.
   The <ORGANIZATION>King Center</ORGANIZATION>'s directors emerged from a six-hour meeting
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE> with a new job for King, but they have not announced what
it is. King has given no indication whether he will accept the job.
   The directors have said the center's presidency will remain
vacant and they consider the matter basically resolved.
   As the <ORGANIZATION>Southern Christian Leadership Conference</ORGANIZATION> convened here
last week, there were several who identified with <PERSON>Dexter King</PERSON>'s
position: that of a young leader who wants his ideas heard in a
movement where the old guard is reluctant to surrender control.
   Among them was <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON>John Lewis</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-Ga.</LOCATION>, a leader in the
<ORGANIZATION>Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee</ORGANIZATION> during the <DATE>1960s</DATE>. <PERSON>Lewis</PERSON>,
49, said such power struggles were a problem nearly 30 years ago.
   ``The sit-ins and the Freedom Rides in <ORGANIZATION>SNCC</ORGANIZATION> were also a revolt
against the old leadership,'' he said. ``What made it different in
that period was we had been provided a role, and a place at the
table.
   ``You cannot take the dream ... to participate, put it in a
bottle and put a cap on it. We should open the doors, make young
people feel welcome.''
   ``One thing about <PERSON>Martin Luther King Jr.</PERSON> _ he welcomed the
involvement of young people,'' <PERSON>Lewis</PERSON> said. ``He praised the vigor
they could bring to a struggle.''
   Civil rights leaders, many of whom have acted as surrogate
fathers to <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s children, said they are concerned about <PERSON>Dexter
King</PERSON>'s welfare.
   ``I do plan to talk to him,'' said <ORGANIZATION>SCLC</ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON>Joseph Lowery</PERSON>,
a member of the <ORGANIZATION>King Center</ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors and a longtime <PERSON>King</PERSON>
family friend. ``I think some mistakes were made on both sides.
   ``I think he's amenable to working it out. He loves the center
and I'm sure he wants to be involved in the vital work the center
does.''
   But another King aide, <PERSON>Hosea Williams</PERSON>, said, ``He ain't going
back in there.'' <PERSON>Williams</PERSON> said <PERSON>King</PERSON> left because the center's
leaders, by giving him the role of ``president-in-training,'' showed
they were unwilling to give him power to change things.
   ``They killed the boy's spirit. He sees now how costly it is, how
tough it is to be a true leader,'' <PERSON>Williams</PERSON> said.
   ``They talking about training. What kind of training does he
need?'' Williams asked. ``Old age is the inability to accept change.
And that is just the problem that <PERSON>Dexter</PERSON> ran into.''
   The Rev. <PERSON>Tony Minor</PERSON>, 30, could readily identify with what <PERSON>Dexter
King</PERSON> experienced.
   Minor, the <ORGANIZATION>SCLC</ORGANIZATION>'s youngest chapter president, pulled together a
conference chapter in <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, that, after eight months, has
150 members _ mostly people under 35.
   A graduate of <PERSON>Martin Luther King</PERSON>'s alma mater, <ORGANIZATION>Morehouse College</ORGANIZATION>,
Minor spent five years as an aide for <PERSON>Lowery</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> Mayor
<PERSON>Andrew Young</PERSON>, learning how to move his ministry into the community
and listening to stories about the movement days.
   Minor said the <ORGANIZATION>SCLC</ORGANIZATION> has made room at the top for youth before,
and he doesn't mind waiting for his day in the sun.
   ``The challenge is for younger leaders to respect and support
veterans who have been around,'' he said. ``Those veterans should,
in turn, adopt the young leaders, teach them, support them.''
   But <PERSON>Williams</PERSON> said, ``Young leaders must not back up or submit to
old leaders like me.''
   ``They've just got to come up and push old leaders on out of the
way,'' he said. ``Old leaders must realize ... we should voluntarily
allow the young leaders to take over and meet today's challenge.
   ``If we don't do that, then what we have suffered for will
perish.''

MURALIST PAINTS FACE OF HOPE FOR YOUTH;

MARTIN LUTHER KING JR. ELEMENTARY IS GETTING IMAGE OF ITS NAMESAKE

Amid drug deals and gang fights in <LOCATION>Southeast San Diego</LOCATION>, an artist is trying to 
keep the Rev. <PERSON>Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.</PERSON>'s dream alive. 
</P>
<P>
At <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King Jr</ORGANIZATION>. Elementary School, <PERSON>Eddie Edwards</PERSON> of <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> is 
painting a two-story-high mural that he says will help show children that they 
can turn their own dreams into reality. 
</P>
<P>
King's face is the focal point of the mural, which is being painted on the east 
wall of the school's auditorium. Below him, children of different races play 
with building blocks with the words friendship, love, peace and we shall 
overcome inscribed on them. <PERSON>Edwards</PERSON> says he hopes the mural will make a 
stronger impression on the children than do the drug deals that take place 
around the school. 
</P>
<P>
"If you touch hands with the youth, you touch hands with the future," he said. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Edwards</PERSON> sees art as an alternative to drugs and crime and explained that he 
decided to portray King in the mural in the hope that children will see they 
can follow the slain civil rights leader's dream to improve their lives. 
</P>
<P>
The mural, which <ORGANIZATION>Edwards</ORGANIZATION> started in <DATE>late June</DATE>, faces the school playground at 
31st Street, where he said drug dealers stand during school hours. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Dana Flowers</PERSON>, a teacher at the school, said she too hopes that <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s positive 
image will turn the children away from drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Several children have already shown interest in the mural and have helped 
<PERSON>Edwards</PERSON> with it, listening to him talk about King and what the painting 
represents. The children are part of a special <DATE>summer</DATE> class geared toward 
raising the level of achievement of black youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
The mural was made possible as part of a <MONEY>$3-million</MONEY> gift by art patron <PERSON>Muriel 
Gluck</PERSON> to the <ORGANIZATION>San Diego Unified School District</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1988</DATE>. The gift was 
distributed between the district's 107 elementary schools and five middle 
schools to fund the "Young at Art" program. 
</P>
<P>
The program was designed to introduce the visual arts to the city's children 
with the help of several local artists and the <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> Museum of Art, which 
received <MONEY>$1 million</MONEY> from the donation. <PERSON>Edwards</PERSON> was hired by the <ORGANIZATION>San Diego 
Unified School District</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The school's name, which was changed in <DATE>1984</DATE> from <ORGANIZATION>Stockton Elementary</ORGANIZATION>, also 
played a big role in deciding on the theme for the mural, <PERSON>Edwards</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have a lot of heroes in the community, but, if people don't give you 
your monuments and statues, you have to make your own," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Completion of the mural is scheduled for late <DATE>August</DATE>.

   Mayor <PERSON>Maynard Jackson</PERSON> and <PERSON>Martin Luther King
Jr.</PERSON>'s widow <DATE>Friday</DATE> urged Atlantans to ignore a <PERSON>Ku Klux Klan</PERSON> rally
planned at the state <LOCATION>Capitol</LOCATION> on <DATE>Saturday</DATE>.
   A white supremacist rally and march in downtown <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> a year
ago turned violent as thousands of counterdemonstrators gathered to
oppose a handful of white suprematist protesters.
   Jackson joined <PERSON>Coretta Scott King</PERSON> for a news conference
outlining events for the city's King Week celebration, which runs
<DATE>Sunday</DATE> through <DATE>Jan. 15</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King Jr</ORGANIZATION>. Day.
   ``The Klan rally is not worthy of your attention,'' <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON>
said. ``Stay home, go shopping, rake leaves ... do whatever you do
on <DATE>Saturdays</DATE>. There's no sense in wasting your time on that. Leave
them alone, and let them say what they have to say _ to each
other.''
   ``That would be a good thing to do,'' agreed <PERSON>Mrs. King</PERSON>,
president of the <ORGANIZATION>King Center</ORGANIZATION>. ``It would be much better if people
stayed away.''
   <PERSON>Mrs. King</PERSON> said she and the center ``believe in the First
Amendment privileges of all people. But we certainly don't agree
with the philosophy of the Klan.''
   The Southern White Knights of the <ORGANIZATION>KKK</ORGANIZATION> plan a morning
demonstration at the state Capitol and an afternoon rally in
<LOCATION>Forsyth County</LOCATION>, the virtually all-white county north of <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>
where ``brotherhood marchers'' were pelted with rocks in <DATE>1987</DATE>,
prompting a second march by 20,000 civil rights supporters.
   The Ad <ORGANIZATION>Hoc Committee Against</ORGANIZATION> the Klan has called this week for
counterdemonstrators to gather in opposition to the Klan. Police
plan to keep the groups apart, and the <ORGANIZATION>National Guard</ORGANIZATION> is on standby.
   <PERSON>Mrs. King</PERSON> told reporters that King Week events will go on
despite recent violence and threats against civil rights activists.
   The commemorative activities come less than a month after four
mail bombs arrived at civil rights and judicial targets in three
states, killing a federal judge in <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION> and a <LOCATION>Savannah</LOCATION> alderman
who was an attorney for the <ORGANIZATION>NAACP</ORGANIZATION>.
   King Week in <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> will include an ecumenical service at
<PERSON>King</PERSON>'s old church, <LOCATION>Ebenezer Baptist</LOCATION>, and a parade down Peachtree
Street and historic Auburn Avenue, site of the <ORGANIZATION>King Center</ORGANIZATION> and the
civil rights leader's crypt.
   ``The precautions one should take _ we always try to take
them,'' said <PERSON>Mrs. King</PERSON>, adding that she was reluctant to draw
further attention to those responsible for the bombings.
   ``To talk about this only invites people to do more of this kind
of violence,'' she said.
   <PERSON>Mrs. King</PERSON> noted that threats of violence are nothing new to the
civil rights community. ``There have been threats on my life ...
and, of course, my husband's life was constantly threatened.'' King
was assassinated in <DATE>1968</DATE>.
   For the first time in the five-year history of the <ORGANIZATION>King</ORGANIZATION> federal
holiday, the <DATE>Monday</DATE> legal holiday falls this year on <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s actual
birthday, <DATE>Jan. 15</DATE>. He would have been 61.

<HEAD>Civil Rights Center Won't Confirm Reported Resignation of King's
Son</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SONYA ROSS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King Jr</ORGANIZATION>. Center for <ORGANIZATION>Non-Violent
Social Change</ORGANIZATION> has refused to confirm or deny reports that the civil
rights leader's 28-year-old son is resigning as center president.
   A source within the civil rights community, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> that differences over how the
center should be managed prompted <PERSON>Dexter King</PERSON> and executive
director <PERSON>Barbara Williams-Skinner</PERSON> to decide to resign. The source
did not say what those differences were.
   <PERSON>Dexter King</PERSON> was named president in <DATE>January</DATE> and officially took
office <DATE>April 4</DATE>, the anniversary of his father's assassination,
saying he wanted to place the center on a solid financial base and
cut its dependency on donations.
   Messages seeking comment from King at his entertainment company,
<ORGANIZATION>Visionary Development Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, and his home were not returned, nor
were calls to at least six <ORGANIZATION>King Center</ORGANIZATION> board members.
   The board said it would issue ``a definitive statement at an
appropriate time.''
   The <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> Journal-Constitution reported that <PERSON>Ms.
Williams-Skinner</PERSON> was said to have clashed with <PERSON>Dexter King</PERSON>'s aunt,
<PERSON>Christine King Farris</PERSON>, who controls the center's finances, over
budgetary and program proposals.
   The newspaper also quoted Mayor <PERSON>Andrew Young</PERSON> as characterizing
the reported resignation as a family dispute fueled by normal
tension between generations. <PERSON>Dexter King</PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON>Coretta Scott
King</PERSON>, is the center's chief executive officer.
   Young, a lieutenant of <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King Jr.</ORGANIZATION> during the <DATE>1960s</DATE>,
was among board members of the center who received copies of a
letter of <PERSON>Dexter King</PERSON>'s resignation, The <ORGANIZATION>New York Times</ORGANIZATION> reported
today.
   City Councilman <PERSON>Hosea Williams</PERSON>, another former King lieutenant,
said the center recently had placed itself in competition with the
<ORGANIZATION>Southern Christian Leadership Conference</ORGANIZATION>, which <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King</ORGANIZATION>
founded, for leadership of the civil rights movement.
   ``The center's purpose was to perpetuate the legacy of <PERSON>Dr. King</PERSON>,
but not to carry on the whole movement,'' <PERSON>Williams</PERSON> said. ``When
they started talking about leading the movement, freeing black
folk, they started competing, and both got hurt.''
   <PERSON>Williams</PERSON> said center staff members told him of conflict and
asked for his help in resolving it, ``but I told them I wasn't in a
position to get involved, because people would interpret that as I
was anti-Mrs. King.''

   The chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>Joint Chiefs of Staff</ORGANIZATION> has
decided not to serve as grand marshal of a parade honoring <ORGANIZATION>Martin

selection.
   Gen. <PERSON>Colin L. Powell</PERSON> said <DATE>Friday</DATE> in a letter to <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s widow,
<PERSON>Coretta Scott King</PERSON>, that he felt his presence might detract from
the <DATE>Jan. 21</DATE> event. He also said events in the <LOCATION>Persian Gulf</LOCATION> might
require that he be in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> then.

for <ORGANIZATION>Nonviolent Social Change</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>Powell</PERSON>, the first black chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>Joint Chiefs of Staff</ORGANIZATION>,

<HEAD>Educators Discuss Formation and Propagation of Curriculum on King

<TEXT>
   Educators gathered <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> to grapple with the
practical and philosophical problems that would confront teachers
in developing a kindergarten-12th grade curriculum on the national
holiday honoring slain civil rights leader <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King Jr</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``If we teach the principles of nonviolent social change to the
kids from kindergarten, what do we do when they stage a walkout?''
one educator asked.
   The answer, from <PERSON>Harold Sims</PERSON> of the Atlanta-based <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther
King Center</ORGANIZATION> for Non-Violent Social Change: ``You have to teach them
the principles of non-violent social change, let them know that
civil disobedience was the last step following long period of
negotiation.''
   Teaching dilemmas, parental reaction, lack of course materials,
training and faculty support were some of the issues raised during
the mini-convention on ``Infusing Educational Materials Related to
<PERSON>Martin Luther King Jr.</PERSON>, into the Curriculum of the <ORGANIZATION>Nation</ORGANIZATION>'s
Schools'' sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION>Education Committee of the Federal
Holiday Commission</ORGANIZATION> and the King center.
   Committee members included <ORGANIZATION>National Education Association</ORGANIZATION>
President <PERSON>Mary Futrell</PERSON>; Sister <PERSON>Catherine McNamee</PERSON>, president of the
<ORGANIZATION>National Catholic Educational Association</ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON>Manya Ungar</PERSON>, president
of the <ORGANIZATION>National Parents and Teachers Association</ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON>Lawrence
Davenport</PERSON>, assistant secretary of the <ORGANIZATION>Department of Energy</ORGANIZATION>, and
<PERSON>Mrs. Christine King Farris</PERSON>, <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s sister.
   Saying she hoped this would be ``the first of many,''
conferences designed to make available audio-visual materials,
training programs and other classroom aids, <PERSON>Futrell</PERSON> said, ``You
cannot simply go out and say `I'm going to teach about the life of
<PERSON>Dr. King</PERSON>' unless you know about his life, unless you understand and
have resources available.''
   <PERSON>Futrell</PERSON> said the purpose of the convention was to give the
participants an opportunity to come together and ``talk about how
we teach about King and how we inculcate that into the curriculum.''
   Many of the speakers discussed the problems associated with
their particular constituent groups.
   ``One problem is that no one has ever been really taught about
King,'' said <PERSON>Gordon Ambach</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Council of Chief State School
Officers</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``You have to recognize that an association like mine is _
predominantly white, Anglo-Saxon, Protestant, middle class and
suburban,'' said <PERSON>Ungar</PERSON> of the national <ORGANIZATION>PTA</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``The board members with which I deal ... are not reflective of
the greater society _ particularly that portion of society which
increasingly has problems getting their voices heard and their
agenda addressed,'' she said.
   She noted that her group was reaching out to other
organizations, such as the Anti-Defamation League, to help produce
literature by next <DATE>June</DATE>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>PTA</ORGANIZATION> board, which prepared itself through training in human
relation skills and a task force for inclusiveness, suggested that
the state and local chapters initiate programs which ``demonstrate
a commitment to the things that <PERSON>Martin Luther King</PERSON> espoused and
stood for,'' she said.
   ``To do this, the parents have got to educate themselves and
find out who <PERSON>Martin Luther King</PERSON> was,'' <PERSON>Ungar</PERSON> said. ``We hope to
have literature aimed at the parents, talking about how we either
overtly or covertly teach prejudice, teach racism or perpetuate
this cycle of hatred and violence,'' she said.

   The Rev. <PERSON>Martin Luther King Jr.</PERSON> was remembered from the pulpit by
fellow clergymen <DATE>Sunday</DATE> as a man whose ``spiritual genius'' and
Christian faith inspired a rebirth of freedom.
   The official national holiday in his honor isn't until <DATE>Monday</DATE>,
but King was hailed in sermons and speeches <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, the day the
murdered civil rights leader would have turned 60.
   ``It's not just a one-day remembrance, but we need to remember
every day what he stood for and what he died for,'' the Rev. <PERSON>Clay
Evans</PERSON>, who worked with <PERSON>King</PERSON>, told worshipers at <ORGANIZATION>Fellowship Baptist
Church</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>. ``I think we have to make it not just a dream,
and not just make it a hollow day ... but a holy day.''
   King's widow, <PERSON>Coretta Scott King</PERSON>, delivered her annual ``State of
the Dream'' speech to 1,200 people crammed into <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>'s historic
<LOCATION>Ebenezer Baptist Church</LOCATION>, where <PERSON>King</PERSON> and his father were co-pastors.
   She urged President-elect <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON> to hold true to his call
for ``a kinder, gentler nation'' by imposing strict sanctions
against <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> and providing direct financial support to
``black <LOCATION>South Africans</LOCATION> who bear the brunt of suffering in that
troubled land.''
   <PERSON>Mrs. King</PERSON> urged <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> to ``put behind the politics of the past''
by addressing several issues during his term of office: affordable
housing, a stepped-up war on drugs and racial violence and the
appointment of federal judges ``who are as tough on discrimination
as they are on street crimes.''
   King, born <DATE>Jan. 15, 1929</DATE>, was assassinated <DATE>April 4, 1968</DATE>, at age
39 on the balcony of a motel in <LOCATION>Memphis</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Tenn</LOCATION>. His killer, <PERSON>James
Earl Ray</PERSON>, is in prison.
   In <DATE>1983</DATE>, after considerable debate, <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> approved creation of
a holiday to honor King on the third <DATE>Monday</DATE> in <DATE>January</DATE>. It was the
first holiday honoring a black American. The first official national
celebration was held in <DATE>1986</DATE>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King Jr</ORGANIZATION>. Day is a state holiday as well as a
federal holiday in all but a handful of states.
   Many cities and states planned their main celebration for <DATE>Monday</DATE>.
<PERSON>Bush</PERSON> planned to attend an ecumenical prayer breakfast organized by
the <ORGANIZATION>Inaugural Afro-American Committee</ORGANIZATION>.
   King's birthday was to be observed at a number of other
celebrations in the capital, including a benefit and fashion show.
   In <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>, a state senator was selected to ring the state's
<ORGANIZATION>Liberty Bell</ORGANIZATION> at the Capitol at <TIME>12:30 p.m. EST</TIME> <DATE>Monday</DATE>. At the same
moment, bells at churches, schools and colleges throughout <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>
will ring in memory of <LOCATION>King</LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION>Liberty Bell</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION>, which
can no longer be rung, will be struck symbolically.
   In <LOCATION>Selma</LOCATION> on <DATE>Monday</DATE>, the first blacks on the <ORGANIZATION>Dallas County
Commission</ORGANIZATION> in more than a century will take the oath of office. It
was there that King began the historic <DATE>1965</DATE> Selma-to-Montgomery
march that resulted in passage of the Voting Rights Act.
   But <DATE>Sunday</DATE> was a day in particular to remember <PERSON>King</PERSON>, who drew his
inspiration, his rhetoric and his philosophy from his Christian
faith, in churches.
   ``King was (a) man who was concerned about people regardless of
color and ethnic background,'' said the Rev. <PERSON>J. Allen Nimmo</PERSON> of the
<ORGANIZATION>Tenth Street Baptist Church</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Camden</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>
   ``<LOCATION>America</LOCATION> should remember that <PERSON>Martin Luther</PERSON> gave his life that
we might live together,'' said <PERSON>Nimmo</PERSON>, who knew <PERSON>King</PERSON> and his family.
``The dream has not yet come true, but I think we are going to get
there. But we are going to have to struggle together.''
   Some who stopped to remember <DATE>King this weekend</DATE> had more personal
memories.
   ``He was a man who enjoyed a good laugh, missed his wife and
children when he was away, who got sad sometimes, who could be a
perfect friend,'' said <PERSON>Helen Maybell Anglin</PERSON>, who runs a restaurant
in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>. Another soul food restaurant of hers, the now-defunct
H&amp;H Cafe, which was one of <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s favorite <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> eateries.
   Even as supporters of King celebrated his spirit, some warned
that the civil rights movement has grown lethargic. Others said that
racial bias is on the rise.
   ``There is a clear and present danger that the dream of <PERSON>Dr.
Martin Luther King Jr.</PERSON> is at risk of being derailed,'' the Rev.
<PERSON>Wyatt Tee Walker</PERSON>, chief of staff for King in the early <DATE>1960s</DATE>.
   ``The establishment of a federal national holiday has seduced us
into becoming comfortable with <PERSON>Martin Luther King</PERSON>,'' <PERSON>Walker</PERSON> told
worshipers at <ORGANIZATION>Riverside Church</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION>. He compared King to
Jesus and said <PERSON>King</PERSON> was ``the only authentic spiritual genius that
Western religion has produced.''
   <PERSON>Hazel Dukes</PERSON>, president of the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> state conference of
branches of the <ORGANIZATION>NAACP</ORGANIZATION>, said King ``would be very disappointed with
us.''
   ``He would be saddened to see how we have lost the fervor of us
coming together, the races of people, Jews and gentiles, white and
black,'' she said.
   In a speech at a <LOCATION>Harlem</LOCATION> church to about 1,500 people, the Rev.
<PERSON>Jesse Jackson</PERSON> said that too many young blacks have a misconceived
notion of what their civil rights are. He chastised youngsters who
think it is their constitutional right to take illegal drugs.
   ``That is a civil wrong. <PERSON>Dr. King</PERSON> did not die for your right to
sniff cocaine and crack and heroin. Stay the dream. Don't betray the
dream,'' <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Monthlong King Pilgrimage to Wind Up in Atlanta Today</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A month-long, multi-state journey that began on
the 20th anniversary of the assassination of the Rev. <PERSON>Martin Luther
King Jr.</PERSON> was headed for the city of his birth today to close with a
``Jobs with Justice'' rally.
   Thousands of civil rights activists, church congregants and
labor union members were expected to join the group of about 30
marchers at the <TIME>afternoon</TIME> rally at the <ORGANIZATION>Atlanta Civic Center</ORGANIZATION>,
organizers said.
   The pilgrimage, organized by the <ORGANIZATION>Southern Christian Leadership
Conference</ORGANIZATION> founded by <PERSON>King</PERSON>, started in <LOCATION>Memphis</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Tenn.</LOCATION>, on <DATE>April 5</DATE> _
one day after a memorial service there in memory of the slain civil
rights leader.
   The Rev. <PERSON>Joseph Lowery</PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION>SCLC</ORGANIZATION>, said at the
outset that he wanted to draw attention to the plight of the poor,
which was a major concern of <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s at the time of his death.
   ``We're trying to stir up the countryside,'' <PERSON>Lowery</PERSON> said.
``We're trying to bring people out to express their outrage about
poverty.''
   Atlanta Mayor <PERSON>Andrew Young</PERSON>, who was a close aide to <PERSON>King</PERSON>, was
scheduled to welcome the rally today. Among the scheduled speakers
were <PERSON>Lowery</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> Commissioner of Agriculture <PERSON>Jim Hightower</PERSON> and a

<HEAD>MLK's Son, President of King Center, Picks Up Civil Rights Mantle</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also in Wednesday AMs report.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SONYA ROSS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The younger son of <PERSON>Martin Luther King Jr.</PERSON> became
heir apparent of a movement when he stood in the pulpit of his
father's church on what would have been the civil rights pioneer's
60th birthday.
   <PERSON>Dexter Scott King</PERSON> declared that he, ``the son of a son of a
movement,'' was ready to take a leadership role. Out rolled the
resonant, vibrant baritone that 25 years earlier prodded blacks to
demand their share of the <ORGANIZATION>American Dream</ORGANIZATION>.
   For many, it was as if MLK himself had come home.
   But <PERSON>Dexter King</PERSON> is a quiet man with a small circle of friends,
lifts weights at home and prefers tennis and books on nutrition to
politics. He was planted squarely in his father's shoes with a
degree of reluctance.
   ``I was tapped. It was simply an issue of something that was
inevitable,'' he said. ``It surprised a lot of people, including
myself, because it's not the kind of thing that you can readily
prepare for.
   ``I had to come to grips with the fact that this life does not
belong to me, and although all of us like to think that we have a
choice in what our roles will be, I have to think of my father's
role.''
   <PERSON>Dexter King</PERSON>'s <DATE>Jan. 14</DATE> appointment as president of <ORGANIZATION>The King
Center</ORGANIZATION>, aimed at keeping his father's legacy alive, was a relief to
the civil rights community; pressure within the movement for someone
to take up the torch had been heavy.
   When <PERSON>Coretta Scott King</PERSON> made the announcement she pointed out
that <PERSON>Dexter</PERSON>, at 28, is about the same age his father was when he led
bus boycotts in <LOCATION>Montgomery</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ala.</LOCATION>, that sparked the civil rights
movement.
   ``Being the son of the civil rights leader makes <PERSON>Dexter</PERSON> uniquely
qualified to assume the civil rights mantle,'' she said.
   Atlanta Mayor <PERSON>Andrew Young</PERSON>, a member of the center's board of
directors and a longtime contemporary of <PERSON>Martin Luther King Jr.</PERSON>,
said <PERSON>Dexter</PERSON>'s selection showed ``we are moving forward, carrying on
with another generation.''
   King says he doesn't want to have to fight with his father's
image.
   ``I have never felt like I or anyone else can walk in his shoes.
I can only follow and complement what he's already done. I've never
seen myself as one who just inherited leadership. There are certain
things you just can't inherit.''
   Yet there are things he did inherit, among them the calm, pensive
demeanor that was his father's trademark. Not the speaking style _
that went to younger sister <PERSON>Bernice</PERSON> _ but <PERSON>Dexter King</PERSON> does sound and
look like his dad.
   ``What he did was exclusive to him. I can only be my best self.
And if being my best self means that I achieve great things and
become a great leader, then I will be commended on that basis, ...
but not because people say `You're going to follow in your father's
footsteps.'''
   <PERSON>Larry Carter</PERSON>, dean of the <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King Jr</ORGANIZATION>. International
Chapel at <ORGANIZATION>Morehouse College</ORGANIZATION>, sees <PERSON>Dexter King</PERSON> as a peaceful man who
will function well as president of the center. ``He seems natural
for that, based on my assessment of his temperament. He's very
polite, he's very considerate.
   ``He's not a rip-roaring orator like his sister <PERSON>Bernice</PERSON>, but he's
capable of passion and has believability.''
   <PERSON>Carter</PERSON>, who has known King for about four years, said he never
knew whether the MLK image was a problem for <PERSON>Dexter King</PERSON>; he never
let it show.
   King, who attended <PERSON>Morehouse</PERSON> _ his father's alma mater _ but has
not graduated, is founder and president of <ORGANIZATION>Visionary Development
Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, a business and development consulting firm. He also directs
the center's office of special events and entertainment and produced
a record marking the first federal King holiday in <DATE>1986</DATE>.
   King said he was first considered for president of <ORGANIZATION>The King
Center</ORGANIZATION> <DATE>two years ago</DATE>, when there was ``some talk amongst the board
members and my mother'' about moving one of the four King children
into a leadership role.
   But <PERSON>Yolanda</PERSON>, 33, serves as the center's producing director of
cultural affairs and runs a theater group with <PERSON>Attallah Shabazz</PERSON>,
daughter of the late Malcolm X; <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King III</ORGANIZATION>, a retiring,
soft-spoken 31-year-old, is a <LOCATION>Fulton County</LOCATION> commissioner; and

   Some of the goals he has set for The King Center include getting
young people excited about a movement they are too young to
remember. He also wants to disseminate the center's message and
non-violent teachings.
   Another primary goal is to get the center on a steady financial
base, he said, with an endowment ``that allows us to

   He hopes it won't be too lonely at the top.
   ``I don't know a lot of young national and international leaders,

frustrating because you really want to have people around you who
can really understand where you're coming from.''

A HOLIDAY FOR ALL TO SHARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This year, five years after <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> created a national holiday on <DATE>Jan. 15</DATE> to 
commemorate <PERSON>Martin Luther King Jr.</PERSON>'s birthday, only four of 29 Orange County 
cities -- and the county itself -- have officially recognized the day and its 
meaning. At the rate additional cities join in, it will be well into the 21st 
Century before the holiday is given its just due. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> made the birthday of the slain civil rights leader a holiday because 
he stood for justice and equality for all races. Those who lived through the 
days when King led nonviolent demonstrations to force the white society to come 
face to face with its own racism will never forget the role this eloquent and 
peaceful man played in national change. But, while the most virulent forms of 
racism have disappeared, there are still gains to be made for blacks in 
<LOCATION>America</LOCATION>, and in <LOCATION>Orange County</LOCATION>. As an indication of the non-acceptance of blacks 
here, their numbers have remained virtually stagnant for a decade, still 
numbering less than 30,000 of a population of more than <MONEY>2 million</MONEY>. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King Day</ORGANIZATION> is not just for blacks. It also represents 
the struggle for equality of all people who come to <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> in search of 
freedom. In <LOCATION>Orange County</LOCATION>, this includes large communities of Vietnamese 
refugees and Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, <ORGANIZATION>Seal Beach</ORGANIZATION> added <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King Day</ORGANIZATION> to its list of employee 
holidays. The year before, <LOCATION>Santa Ana</LOCATION> joined the cities of <LOCATION>Irvine</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Huntington 
Beach</LOCATION>, as well as <LOCATION>Orange County</LOCATION>, to celebrate the symbolic day. During this 
coming year, other cities should join with them so that, well before the turn 
of the century, it is a holiday observed by all in <LOCATION>Orange County</LOCATION>.

   Civil rights leaders are demanding that the Rev.
<PERSON>Ralph David Abernathy</PERSON> retract implications in his new book that the
Rev. <PERSON>Martin Luther King Jr.</PERSON> had sexual encounters with women on the
<TIME>night</TIME> before he was killed.
   A <LOCATION>Memphis</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Tenn.</LOCATION>, woman said in an interview published <DATE>today</DATE>
that she was with <PERSON>Abernathy</PERSON> and <TIME>King that night</TIME>, and she disputed
part of the account in <ORGANIZATION>Abernathy</ORGANIZATION>'s autobiography, ``And The Walls
Came Tumbling Down.''
   In his book, published this month, <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s onetime top aide says
<PERSON>King</PERSON> spent parts of the night before his death alone with two
different women and physically fought with a third.
   Abernathy wrote that he awoke from a nap in a woman's living
room after a late-night dinner to see King and the woman emerge
from a bedroom. Adjua Abi Naantaanbuu told <ORGANIZATION>The Commercial Appeal</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Memphis</LOCATION> that she was host of the dinner and that she and her sister
talked with <PERSON>King</PERSON> and another aide in the living room while
<PERSON>Abernathy</PERSON>, who ``had too many'' drinks, slept on her bed.
   In an interview published <DATE>today</DATE> in The <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>
Journal-Constitution, <PERSON>Abernathy</PERSON> rejected suggestions by some of the
civil rights leaders that two strokes and brain surgery might have
impaired his memory. ``I am most surprised anybody would think I'm
mentally incompetent,'' <PERSON>Abernathy</PERSON> said.
   <PERSON>Abernathy</PERSON> has said that he did not include passages about <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s
extramarital affairs out of malice, but felt he needed to address
the issue since it had been discussed in previous biographies of
the <ORGANIZATION>Nobel Peace Prize</ORGANIZATION> winner.
   ``I loved <PERSON>Martin Luther King</PERSON> more than a brother. I would never
do it to injure him,'' <PERSON>Abernathy</PERSON> said.
   A coalition of black leaders including <PERSON>Jesse Jackson</PERSON> and <PERSON>Andrew
Young</PERSON> said <DATE>Thursday</DATE> they objected to the controversial passages and
doubted that <PERSON>Abernathy</PERSON> wrote them. A spokesman for the book's
publisher replied that the whole book was written solely by the
<LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> minister.
   The group's statement concluded that ``the <LOCATION>Memphis</LOCATION> section'' of
<PERSON>Abernathy</PERSON>'s book was so out of character with <PERSON>Abernathy</PERSON>'s life and
previous statements that it must have been ``put into your mouth by
others who needed a sensational story to sell books and slander the
name of your martyred brother.''
   <PERSON>Steve Sorrentino</PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION>Harper &amp; Row</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, said
the allegations are untrue.
   ``The book is entirely <PERSON>Abernathy</PERSON>'s words. There was no
co-writer, no ghost writer,'' <PERSON>Sorrentino</PERSON> said. ``He stands by
everything he says in the book. I wonder if all the people sitting
back criticizing now have read the book.
   ``The book is not a sensationalized, `put down <PERSON>Martin Luther
King</PERSON>' book,'' <PERSON>Sorrentino</PERSON> said. ``He reveres <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King</ORGANIZATION> and
takes two pages to address what everyone has talked about before.
He wanted to address it and be honest about it.''
   Abernathy _ appearing to promote the book <DATE>Thursday</DATE> in <LOCATION>Memphis</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Tenn.</LOCATION>, where King was slain <DATE>April 4, 1968</DATE> _ said he was surprised
by the uproar.
   ``I'm not Judas,'' he told reporters. ``I know who I am. I'm a
Christian minister.''
   <PERSON>Jesse Hill</PERSON>, chairman of the board of <ORGANIZATION>The King Center</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>,
said a number of civil rights leaders including <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON>, Young,
<ORGANIZATION>NAACP</ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON>Benjamin Hooks</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Southern Christian Leadership
Conference</ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON>Joseph Lowery</PERSON>, sent <PERSON>Abernathy</PERSON> a telegram
<DATE>Sunday</DATE> calling on him to repudiate his writings.
   ``We take particular exception to your personal reconstruction
of <ORGANIZATION>Martin</ORGANIZATION>'s last hours on this earth,'' said the telegram, read to
reporters by Hill at a news conference in front of <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s tomb at
<ORGANIZATION>The King Center</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``The Ralph we know and love would not have written this
section. ... We deplore the fact that, for this account, if it is
not repudiated, will rob you of your rightful place in history.''
   Jackson issued a statement that the character of <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s work
would stand ``when all the dust clears.''
   ``<PERSON>Dr. King</PERSON> cannot speak for himself,'' the statement said.
``Those of us who appreciate <PERSON>Dr. King</PERSON>'s work will stand with him
through every challenge.''
   Hooks, in a statement released from <ORGANIZATION>NAACP</ORGANIZATION> headquarters in
<LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION>, said he had read the book and was ``deeply saddened and
distressed'' that <PERSON>Abernathy</PERSON> ``would succumb to the temptation to
desecrate'' <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s memory.
   King Center officials said <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s widow, <PERSON>Coretta Scott King</PERSON>,
president of the center, would have no statement other than to
endorse that made by Hill, the center's board chairman.
   <PERSON>John Hurst Adams</PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION>African Methodist Episcopal Church</ORGANIZATION> bishop,
said <PERSON>Young</PERSON>, <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON>, Hooks and former <PERSON>King</PERSON> aide <PERSON>Bernard Lee</PERSON>, all of
whom were in <LOCATION>Memphis</LOCATION> with King on his final days, have ``sharply
different'' recollections of the events of those days.

<HEAD>MLK's Son, President Of King Center, Picks Up Civil Rights Mantle</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SONYA ROSS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The younger son of <PERSON>Martin Luther King Jr.</PERSON> became
heir apparent of a movement when he stood in the pulpit of his
father's church on what would have been the civil rights pioneer's
60th birthday.
   <PERSON>Dexter Scott King</PERSON> declared that he, ``the son of a son of a
movement,'' was ready to take a leadership role. Out rolled the
resonant, vibrant baritone that 25 years earlier prodded blacks to
demand their share of the <ORGANIZATION>American Dream</ORGANIZATION>.
   For many, it was as if MLK himself had come home.
   But <PERSON>Dexter King</PERSON> is a quiet man with a small circle of friends,
lifts weights at home and prefers tennis and books on nutrition to
politics. He was planted squarely in his father's shoes with a
degree of reluctance.
   ``I was tapped. It was simply an issue of something that was
inevitable,'' he said. ``It surprised a lot of people, including
myself, because it's not the kind of thing that you can readily
prepare for.
   ``I had to come to grips with the fact that this life does not
belong to me, and although all of us like to think that we have a
choice in what our roles will be, I have to think of my father's
role.''
   <PERSON>Dexter King</PERSON>'s <DATE>Jan. 14</DATE> appointment as president of <ORGANIZATION>The King
Center</ORGANIZATION>, aimed at keeping his father's legacy alive, was a relief to
the civil rights community; pressure within the movement for someone
to take up the torch had been heavy.
   When <PERSON>Coretta Scott King</PERSON> made the announcement she pointed out
that <PERSON>Dexter</PERSON>, at 28, is about the same age his father was when he led
bus boycotts in <LOCATION>Montgomery</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ala.</LOCATION>, that sparked the civil rights
movement.
   ``Being the son of the civil rights leader makes <PERSON>Dexter</PERSON> uniquely
qualified to assume the civil rights mantle,'' she said.
   Atlanta Mayor <PERSON>Andrew Young</PERSON>, a member of the center's board of
directors and a longtime contemporary of <PERSON>Martin Luther King Jr.</PERSON>,
said <PERSON>Dexter</PERSON>'s selection showed ``we are moving forward, carrying on
with another generation.''
   King says he doesn't want to have to fight with his father's
image.
   ``I have never felt like I or anyone else can walk in his shoes.
I can only follow and complement what he's already done. I've never
seen myself as one who just inherited leadership. There are certain
things you just can't inherit.''
   Yet there are things he did inherit, among them the calm, pensive
demeanor that was his father's trademark. Not the speaking style _
that went to younger sister <PERSON>Bernice</PERSON> _ but <PERSON>Dexter King</PERSON> does sound and
look like his dad.
   ``What he did was exclusive to him. I can only be my best self.
And if being my best self means that I achieve great things and
become a great leader, then I will be commended on that basis, ...
but not because people say `You're going to follow in your father's
footsteps.'''
   <PERSON>Larry Carter</PERSON>, dean of the <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King Jr</ORGANIZATION>. International
Chapel at <ORGANIZATION>Morehouse College</ORGANIZATION>, sees <PERSON>Dexter King</PERSON> as a peaceful man who
will function well as president of the center. ``He seems natural
for that, based on my assessment of his temperament. He's very
polite, he's very considerate.
   ``He's not a rip-roaring orator like his sister <PERSON>Bernice</PERSON>, but he's
capable of passion and has believability.''
   <PERSON>Carter</PERSON>, who has known King for about four years, said he never
knew whether the MLK image was a problem for <PERSON>Dexter King</PERSON>; he never
let it show.
   King, who attended <PERSON>Morehouse</PERSON> _ his father's alma mater _ but has
not graduated, is founder and president of <ORGANIZATION>Visionary Development
Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, a business and development consulting firm. He also directs
the center's office of special events and entertainment and produced
a record marking the first federal King holiday in <DATE>1986</DATE>.
   King said he was first considered for president of <ORGANIZATION>The King
Center</ORGANIZATION> <DATE>two years ago</DATE>, when there was ``some talk amongst the board
members and my mother'' about moving one of the four King children
into a leadership role.
   But <PERSON>Yolanda</PERSON>, 33, serves as the center's producing director of
cultural affairs and runs a theater group with <PERSON>Attallah Shabazz</PERSON>,
daughter of the late Malcolm X; <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King III</ORGANIZATION>, a retiring,
soft-spoken 31-year-old, is a <LOCATION>Fulton County</LOCATION> commissioner; and
<PERSON>Bernice</PERSON>, 25, is working toward a graduate degree in law and theology
at <ORGANIZATION>Emory University</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>.
   ``At that time, I was not specifically targeted,'' <PERSON>King</PERSON> said.
``Recently, ... our immediate family more or less talked about the
fact that my mother is not getting any younger.''
   He explained that the changes, effective <DATE>April 4</DATE> _ the 21st
anniversary of his father's assassination _ would ``free my mother
up and allow us to work as a team.'' King will manage the center's
administrative operations while his mother serves as spokeswoman and
chief executive officer.
   Some of the goals he has set for The King Center include getting
young people excited about a movement they are too young to
remember. He also wants to disseminate the center's message and
non-violent teachings.
   Another primary goal is to get the center on a steady financial
base, he said, with an endowment ``that allows us to
institutionalize our work so that we're not just trying to hang on
day by day or donation by donation.''
   He hopes it won't be too lonely at the top.
   ``I don't know a lot of young national and international leaders,
but I will be thrust into that role. It is lonely, and it is
frustrating because you really want to have people around you who
can really understand where you're coming from.''

   A son of slain civil rights leader <PERSON>Dr.
Martin Luther King Jr</PERSON>. <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> told middle school students that gay
people have ``a problem.''
   ``Our population is really all kind of mixed up right now,''
<ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King III</ORGANIZATION> said during a speech observing <ORGANIZATION>Black History
Month</ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION>Poughkeepsie Middle School</ORGANIZATION>. ``I mean, we've got a straight
community and a community we call the gay community. ... We laugh,
but that's real.''
   ``Now something may be wrong in the makeup of that individual if
they happen to be that way. Any man that has a desire to be with
another man has a problem, in my opinion,'' <PERSON>King</PERSON> said. ``And that
applies to any woman who has a desire to be with another woman.''
   King did not talk to reporters afterward.
   An official with a national gay rights group called <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s
remarks ``strange and upsetting'' considering the increased reports
of violence against gays nationwide.
   ``The majority of cases are in fact perpetrated by young people
who really don't see anything wrong with anti-gay bigotry,'' said
<PERSON>Karin Schwartz</PERSON>, assistant director of the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> City-based Gay
and <ORGANIZATION>Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``His statements won't do anything to confront that belief that
many students have and, if anything, will bolster it,'' she said.

   Japanese Prime Minister <PERSON>Toshiki Kaifu</PERSON> visited the
tomb of the Rev. <PERSON>Martin Luther King Jr.</PERSON> and met briefly today with
the slain civil rights leader's widow.
   Kaifu and his wife, <PERSON>Sachiyo</PERSON>, stood together after he placed a
wreath of pink and red carnations, purple daisies and burgundy
chrysanthemums on King's grave.
   He made no public comments during the ceremony and reporters
were not allowed at a short meeting later between <PERSON>Kaifu</PERSON> and <PERSON>Coretta
Scott King</PERSON>.
   American civil rights advocates were outraged four years ago
when then-Prime Minister <PERSON>Nasuhiro Nakasone</PERSON> said blacks and
Hispanics lowered <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> intelligence standards.
   <PERSON>Steve Klein</PERSON>, research associate at the <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King Jr</ORGANIZATION>.
Center for <ORGANIZATION>Nonviolent Social Change</ORGANIZATION>, said civil rights leaders
appreciated <PERSON>Kaifu</PERSON>'s gesture.
   ``He's a new prime minister,'' <PERSON>Klein</PERSON> said. ``We can't hold him
responsible for what others have said.''
   Kaifu was to deliver a speech <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> outlining a broad
cultural exchange project and encouraging cooperation between <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>
and the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, said <PERSON>Stephen Allen</PERSON>, public relations officer
for the <ORGANIZATION>Japanese Consulate</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>.
   Kaifu has made few public remarks since he arrived in <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION>
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> but told <ORGANIZATION>The Atlanta Journal-Constitution</ORGANIZATION> in a
written statement that ``the <ORGANIZATION>American Southeast</ORGANIZATION> has long had good
relations with <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, and this region is today home to about 600
Japanese companies ... (that) contribute to the region's economic
development.
   ``I am hoping to have the chance to meet with some of these
corporate leaders, and I will take the opportunity to encourage
them to fit in with their local communities as good corporate
citizens,'' he said.
   Kaifu planned brief meetings today with local Japanese business
leaders as well as a private meeting with <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON>Joe Frank
Harris</PERSON> and Govs. <PERSON>James Martin</PERSON> of <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Bill Clinton</PERSON> of

   The ouster of <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON>Evan Mecham</PERSON>, who
canceled a state holiday honoring civil rights crusader <PERSON>Martin
Luther King Jr.</PERSON>, was cheered by hundreds at a banquet commemorating
<PERSON>King</PERSON>'s assassination 20 years ago.
   <ORGANIZATION>Southern Christian Leadership Conference</ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON>Joseph Lowery</PERSON>
announced <PERSON>Mecham</PERSON>'s conviction by the <ORGANIZATION>Arizona Senate</ORGANIZATION> <DATE>Monday</DATE> at the
awards dinner that night.
   About 750 people cheered and applauded as the civil rights
anthem, ``We Shall Overcome,'' played softly in the background.
   ``I hate to rejoice,'' <PERSON>Lowery</PERSON> said, ``but I feel good about this
... We did overcome. Justice has been served.''
   Mecham was removed from office 20 years to the day that <PERSON>King</PERSON>,
who founded the <ORGANIZATION>SCLC</ORGANIZATION>, was shot to death in <LOCATION>Memphis</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Tenn</LOCATION>.
   Mayor <PERSON>Andrew Young</PERSON>, an aide to King and an ordained
Congregationalist minister, reacted to the news with a Bible verse:
``Whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.''
   In <LOCATION>Altamont</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION>, meanwhile, where <PERSON>Mecham</PERSON> grew up, his removal
from office was lamented by relatives and some old acquaintances.
   ``It's just a dirty deal and Mafia-headed. He has just been
blackballed. I think it's disgusting,'' said his cousin <ORGANIZATION>Ona</ORGANIZATION> Rust of
<LOCATION>Altamont</LOCATION>. ``I'm very disappointed in the people of <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>.''
   Mecham graduated from <ORGANIZATION>Altamont High School</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1942</DATE> and moved
away after joining the service in <DATE>1943</DATE>. He is scheduled to address
the high school's commencement ceremony <DATE>May 27</DATE>.
   A former classmate, <LOCATION>Beverly Fieldsted</LOCATION>, who was one year behind
<PERSON>Mecham</PERSON> in high school, said <PERSON>Mecham</PERSON>'s removal must stem from a
misunderstanding and the former governor is innocent.
   Mecham canceled a King holiday for state workers on <DATE>Jan. 12,
1987</DATE>, angering civil rights leaders and triggering a boycott by
some organizations that had planned conventions and by some rock
groups.
   He went on to anger blacks, Jews, women and homosexuals with
official actions or offhand remarks.
   Among other things, he defended the use of the word
``pickaninny'' for black children.
   ``I think Gov. <PERSON>Mecham</PERSON> exhibited insensitivity, a corruption of
spirit,'' <PERSON>Lowery</PERSON> said in an interview. ``I think it had to be a
corruption of spirit in order to insult <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King</ORGANIZATION> and the
birthday holiday which the nation wanted to honor.''
   King's widow, <PERSON>Coretta Scott King</PERSON>, stood thoughtfully after being
told of <PERSON>Mecham</PERSON>'s impeachment, and declined to comment.
   The <ORGANIZATION>SCLC</ORGANIZATION> dinner was held to present the group's annual <ORGANIZATION>Martin
Luther King Jr</ORGANIZATION>. Memorial Drum Major for <ORGANIZATION>Justice Awards</ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>     Yet, as <PERSON>Dr. Harding</PERSON> points out, the <PERSON>Martin Luther King Jr.</PERSON> of <DATE>1967</DATE> had seen
the prospects for fulfilling his dream shattered by the nation's deepening
involvement in the <LOCATION>Vietnam War.</LOCATION>;    On <DATE>April 4, 1967</DATE> -- exactly one year
before he was assassinated -- <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> condemned <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> military involvement in
the <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> War in a speech at <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION>'s Riverside Church:;    "A few
years ago . . . it seemed as if there was a real promise of hope for the
poor," he said, referring to President <PERSON>Lyndon Johnson</PERSON>'s War on Poverty. "There
were experiments, hopes, new beginnings. Then came the buildup in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>, and
I watched the program broken and eviscerated. . . . I knew that <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> would
never invest the funds and energies in the rehabilitation of its poor so long
as adventures like <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> continued to draw men and skills and money like
some demoniacal destructive suction tube.";    He expressed his deep
disappointment that the <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> War caused the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> to "increase our
troop commitments in support of governments which were singularly corrupt,
inept and without popular support.";    When <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> later stated that the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
government had become "the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today,"
he drew widespread criticism, even from some of his supporters.;    But my
husband had told the painful truth -- for no other government had sent a
half-million troops to intervene on behalf of a brutal, corrupt dictatorship
that was thousands of miles from its own boundaries. No other government had
squandered many <MONEY>billions of dollars</MONEY> on the weapons of destruction while
millions of its own people languished in poverty, homelessness and
malnutrition. He warned that our intervention in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> was a symptom of a
"far deeper malady" that would lead the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> into future wars. And he
called for a unilateral cease-fire and the withdrawal of all foreign troops.; 
  The <LOCATION>Persian Gulf</LOCATION> is not <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>. But <PERSON>Martin</PERSON>'s criticism of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
government's proneness for military adventurism remains particularly relevant
in <DATE>1991.</DATE>;    <DATE>Today</DATE>, we might ask ourselves the question he asked in <DATE>1967</DATE>: "Why
has our nation placed itself in the position of being God's military agent on
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>? . . . Why have we substituted the arrogant undertaking of policing the
whole world for the high task of putting our own house in order?";    Before
the war broke, the <ORGANIZATION>Center for Defense Information</ORGANIZATION> estimated that military
aggression against <ORGANIZATION>Iraq</ORGANIZATION> could cost taxpayers <MONEY>$140 billion</MONEY> in the year ahead.
It also is estimated that each day of war in the gulf will cost four times the
amount of our annual contribution to the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations.</ORGANIZATION>;    The human cost of
war will be even greater; 20,000 Americans could lose their lives, according
to one estimate.;    Military spending was out of control even before the
crisis in the gulf. When you subtract self-funding accounts such as Social
Security from the federal budget, our government is spending <MONEY>55 cents</MONEY> out of
every taxpayer dollar on the military. This compares with just <MONEY>two cents</MONEY> for
education.;    Excessive military spending isn't just frustration for
taxpayers, it's a nightmare for those who depend on social programs. While we
can be thankful that the Americans held in <LOCATION>Kuwait</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Iraq</ORGANIZATION> have come home, our
nation's 20 million illiterate, 3 million homeless and 20 million malnourished
citizens still are being held hostage.;    As <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> said in <DATE>1967</DATE>, "A nation
that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on
programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual death.";    <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther
King Jr.</ORGANIZATION> challenged us to build a world free from poverty, racism and
militarism. Let us celebrate his life and work by rededicating ourselves to
non-violence.  </TEXT>

CORETTA SCOTT KING SIDESTEPS CONTROVERSY ON CONVENTION CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Coretta <PERSON>Scott King</PERSON>, the widow of <PERSON>Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.</PERSON>, gave a lecture on 
the civil rights movement to hundreds of students at the <ORGANIZATION>University of San 
Diego</ORGANIZATION> <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, but she sidestepped the controversy over the naming of the <ORGANIZATION>San 
Diego Convention Center</ORGANIZATION> after the slain civil rights leader. 
</P>
<P>
King, whose lecture was "Perspectives of Civil Rights," said she doesn't know 
much about the issue and she tries to stay out of decisions made by local 
communities with regard to honoring King. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not . . . informed about the specific issue. . . . Every city has its own 
way" of honoring <PERSON>King</PERSON>, she told a reporter. "A lot depends upon . . . people 
within the community." 
</P>
<P>
King added that she doesn't like "getting involved with those kind of local 
situations. There are so many people who always try to pull me into them. 
</P>
<P>
"If we truly believe <PERSON>Dr. King</PERSON> made this nation a better nation, . . . citizens 
of good will want to do -- in their own way -- the proper thing to recognize 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 800 students filled the <PERSON>Camino Hall</PERSON> auditorium to hear <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s talk, 
sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION>USD</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Associated Students</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Faculty Social Issues Committee</ORGANIZATION>, 
and Women's Program. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Still Gets Death Threats 
</P>
<P>
"The average one of you (students) is 19 to 20 years of age; that means you 
were not born, or being born, or just born when <PERSON>Martin Luther King Jr.</PERSON> was 
assassinated almost 20 years ago," <PERSON>King</PERSON> told the students. "Unless you've had 
the opportunity to learn about the civil rights movement and the history of the 
African American struggle in this country, it is pretty foreign and alien to 
you, particularly here in the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION>." 
</P>
<P>
King, who said that, after 30 years, she still gets death threats, reminisced 
about the desegregation effort in <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION> and the suffering of those committed 
to nonviolent demonstration. "We kept the faith in the American dream. 
Somewhere we read about this idea of democracy. . . . Somewhere, we got this 
notion that all men are created equal." 
</P>
<P>
King emphasized that changes in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s society have been made through the 
"suffering and sacrifices of individuals, black and white, American people of 
good will of all races." 
</P>
<P>
Although "clearly we've come a long way since the days of the civil rights 
movement," King cited injustices that still pervade our society, such as the 
fact that black college graduates earn less than white high school graduates, 
that racial conflicts have arisen on school campuses and the lack of blacks in 
key governmental positions. 
</P>
<P>
"We've come a long way in bringing people an awareness to what he stood for: 
principles of nonviolence, human rights, an example of human dignity and 
decency. He taught how to love unconditionally. That's important in a world 
context. . . . We have to understand and respect and appreciate people who are 
different from ourselves. That is what we really say <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> is all about. It 
is a home for all of God's children." 
</P>
<P>
King emphasized in her lecture that the principles of nonviolence can still 
work in the <DATE>1990s</DATE>, and have recently been applied in the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION> and in the 
struggle against apartheid in <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>. "Nonviolence, when practiced . . . 
really works," she said. 
</P>
<P>
King, who noted that <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> was also <ORGANIZATION>International Women</ORGANIZATION>'s Day, spoke on 
behalf of women's rights, and encouraged women to be leaders in a "bold, new 
vision" of a more peaceful world. "Women must be a moral vanguard for a more 
compassionate, humanitarian world community," she said. 
</P>
<P>
She also spoke <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> on "Black-Jewish Relations: Conflict or 
Healing?" at <ORGANIZATION>Congregation Beth El</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>La Jolla</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman <PERSON>Wes Pratt</PERSON>, who attended the <ORGANIZATION>USD</ORGANIZATION> lecture, said he was not 
disappointed that <PERSON>King</PERSON> refused to jump into the fray on the naming of the 
convention center. "This is a local issue, and it's up to the local community 
to recognize the contributions of <PERSON>Martin Luther King</PERSON>," <PERSON>Pratt</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
Pratt said he intends to move that the issue be sent back to the <LOCATION>Port District</LOCATION> 
for a vote. "They begged the question; they should have voted it up or down, 
they dragged this thing out and offended a significant amount of people with 
the process."

VANDALS MARK HOLIDAY BY DEFACING SIGNS BEARING DR. KING'S NAME ON 94 FREEWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By YOLANDA RODRIGUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the day honoring the Rev. <PERSON>Martin Luther King Jr.</PERSON>, vandals spray-painted a 
swastika and racial graffiti <DATE>Monday</DATE> on <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> 94 freeway signs carrying the 
slain civil rights leader's name. 
</P>
<P>
This is the second time the signs have been defaced since they were unveiled 
two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Within two weeks after the 10-mile stretch of <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> 94 was christened in 
King's honor <DATE>Nov. 20</DATE>, the letters <ORGANIZATION>KKK</ORGANIZATION> were painted across one of the signs on 
the westbound side of the freeway near the <LOCATION>Lemon Grove</LOCATION> exit in <LOCATION>La Mesa</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
On <DATE>Monday</DATE>, two signs were painted with the letters <ORGANIZATION>SWP</ORGANIZATION>, which police believe 
stand for <ORGANIZATION>Supreme White Power</ORGANIZATION>, and with swastikas. 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> police said one of the defaced signs was discovered at about <TIME>9 a.m.</TIME> 
on the east side of the freeway near <LOCATION>Interstate 805</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"We are treating this as a hate crime," Sgt. <PERSON>Fred England</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
The second vandalized sign was on the west side of the highway, near the Spring 
Street exit in <LOCATION>La Mesa</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. <PERSON>George Walker Smith</PERSON>, pastor of the <ORGANIZATION>Christ United Presbyterian Church</ORGANIZATION> 
and a black community leader, said he was not surprised by the defacing. "You 
can expect this from a racist community," he said. A memorial to <PERSON>King</PERSON> has been 
a sore point for <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>'s black community. 
</P>
<P>
Last <DATE>July</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>Board of Port Commissioners</ORGANIZATION>, in a 4-3 vote, rejected the <ORGANIZATION>City 
Council</ORGANIZATION>'s request to name the convention center after King. The <ORGANIZATION>San Diego 
Convention Center</ORGANIZATION> opened to the public four days after the unveiling of four 
new signs on <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> 94. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. <PERSON>George Stevens</PERSON>, who led the convention center fight, denounced the 
latest incident. 
</P>
<P>
"It's unfortunate that this happened," he said. "But it's disgraceful that the 
elected leadership in <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> has not taken a position on this. The 
leadership is perpetuating (racism) by not speaking out against it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The good people who are white should be embarrassed by this. . . . They should 
come out and condemn this," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop <PERSON>George McKinney</PERSON>, pastor of <ORGANIZATION>St. Stephen's Church of God</ORGANIZATION> on <LOCATION>Imperial 
Avenue</LOCATION>, was chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King Jr</ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION>Freeway Committee</ORGANIZATION>, which was 
formed to raise funds for the signs. He could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The naming of the freeway after <PERSON>King</PERSON> is the last of several official attempts 
to find a place to honor him. 
</P>
<P>
In <DATE>April, 1986</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>City Council</ORGANIZATION> voted against naming <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> 94 for King 
and voted instead to rename Market Street for him. But, in a referendum a year 
later, voters rejected <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King Way</ORGANIZATION> and restored Market Street. 
</P>
<P>
In the aftermath of that battle, members of the <ORGANIZATION>Chamber of Commerce</ORGANIZATION> worked with 
black leaders to establish a scholarship fund and a statue of King in <LOCATION>Balboa 
Park</LOCATION>, which hasn't been erected. 
</P>
<P>
Last <DATE>September</DATE>, following the <ORGANIZATION>Port District</ORGANIZATION>'s decision on the convention 
center, the <ORGANIZATION>Legislature</ORGANIZATION> approved renaming <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> 94 at the urging of 
Assemblyman <PERSON>Pete Chacon</PERSON> (D-San Diego) and state <PERSON>Sen. Wadie P. Deddeh</PERSON> (D-Chula 
Vista). But the <ORGANIZATION>Legislature</ORGANIZATION> stipulated that private donations be used to pay 
for the new signs.

<TEXT>
   <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King Day</ORGANIZATION> won't be a state holiday in <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION> this year. 

   Yesterday, newly elected Republican Gov. <PERSON>Evan Mecham</PERSON> formally rescinded a state holiday for the assassinated civil rights leader. 
His predecessor, Democratic Gov. <PERSON>Bruce Babbitt</PERSON>, issued an executive order last <DATE>May</DATE> declaring <DATE>Jan. 19</DATE> an official holiday for state workers. 

   Yesterday, Gov. <PERSON>Mecham</PERSON>, who took office <DATE>Jan. 5</DATE>, said he doesn't believe that the former governor had the authority to issue the proclamation. 

   A spokesman for Gov. <PERSON>Mecham</PERSON> said the state's attorney general had told the new governor he must rescind the holiday. 
The spokesman said that under state law only the state legislature can declare a state holiday for workers. 

   The spokesman said the former governor issued the order for "political expedience and to get national attention and to appeal to a particular segment of the population." 
Gov. <PERSON>Mecham</PERSON> suggested that the legislature pass a referendum to put the question on the ballot in the next general election. 
The <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION> legislature voted against making <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King Day</ORGANIZATION> a state holiday last year. 
<ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King Day</ORGANIZATION> is a paid holiday for federal workers.

<HEAD>Coretta Scott King Aims To Cut Short Showdown With BU Over King
Papers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARLENE LEVINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Coretta <PERSON>Scott King</PERSON> has asked a judge to skip a
trial and immediately decide whether she or <ORGANIZATION>Boston University</ORGANIZATION> own
papers of her slain husband, civil rights leader <PERSON>Martin Luther King
Jr</PERSON>.
   At issue are 83,000 documents now at King's alma mater that
range from letters to <PERSON>Eleanor Roosevelt</PERSON> to the outline of his ``I
Have a Dream'' speech.
   A sworn statement and documents turned over by the university
support allegations that <PERSON>King</PERSON> never donated his papers to <ORGANIZATION>BU</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Mrs.
King</PERSON> claimed in a request for a summary judgment filed last week in
<ORGANIZATION>Suffolk Superior Court</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``It's kind of a shortcut in the case,'' said <PERSON>Archer Smith</PERSON>, <PERSON>Mrs.
King</PERSON>'s <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> attorney, in a telephone interview <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>. ``The
letter is so clear. We're asking the judge to cut through the
jargon and everything else.''
   No hearing on the request for summary judgment was immediately
set. The case has not yet been assigned to a judge.
   Last <DATE>December</DATE>, <PERSON>Mrs. King</PERSON> sued <ORGANIZATION>Boston University</ORGANIZATION> to recover the
papers her husband gave to the school where he earned a doctorate
in theology in <DATE>1955</DATE>. The suit claims the university has not
properly maintained the papers and is illegally keeping them. King
sent the papers to the school in <DATE>1964</DATE>, four years before his
assassination.
   <PERSON>Mrs. King</PERSON> wants the papers kept with 100,000 more in his
archives at the <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King Jr</ORGANIZATION>. Center for <ORGANIZATION>Nonviolent Social
Change</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>.
   In the request for a summary judgment, <PERSON>Mrs. King</PERSON>'s lawyers said
that <PERSON>Howard T. Gotlieb</PERSON>, chief of reference and special collections
for <ORGANIZATION>Boston University</ORGANIZATION> libraries, had indicated in a deposition that
as far as he knew, <PERSON>King</PERSON> never designated any of the papers at the
university as an outright gift.
   The university also gave <PERSON>Mrs. King</PERSON>'s lawyers a <DATE>1964</DATE> letter by
<PERSON>G.A. Harrer</PERSON>, then director of libraries for the university, saying
the university was interested in becoming the repository for <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s
papers.
   <PERSON>Melvin B. Miller</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>BU</ORGANIZATION> trustee whose law firm is representing
the university in its countersuit against <PERSON>Mrs. King</PERSON>, scoffed at the
latest volley from the other side.
   ``It's strange that they think there are no questions of fact in
this case,'' he said. ``Everything is to be settled. Nothing is
settled.''
   Key to the entire battle is a <DATE>July 16, 1964</DATE>, letter by <ORGANIZATION>King
naming Boston University</ORGANIZATION> repository of his papers. King was killed
in <DATE>1968</DATE> and did not leave a will.
   In the letter, <PERSON>King</PERSON> said the papers would remain his legal
property but that every year he would donate part of the collection
to the university.
   <PERSON>Mrs. King</PERSON>'s lawyers maintain that while <PERSON>King</PERSON> sent papers to
<ORGANIZATION>Boston University</ORGANIZATION>, he did not take the step of making them a gift.
   The university in its countersuit claims it owns the King papers
in <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> as well as those it has because the <DATE>1964</DATE> letter made
<ORGANIZATION>Boston University</ORGANIZATION> the depository for all <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s papers.
   <PERSON>Mrs. King</PERSON>'s lawyers insist the letter did not constitute a
contract or charitable pledge and violates laws governing wills.
They have asked that the countersuit be dismissed.

<TEXT>
   Mayor <PERSON>Andrew Young</PERSON> defended on <DATE>Thursday</DATE> the
assignment of a county deputy to the <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King Jr</ORGANIZATION>. Center
for <ORGANIZATION>Nonviolent Social Change</ORGANIZATION> and the family of the slain civil
rights leader.
   <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> also has a police officer stationed at the center as his
regular ``base of operations,'' <PERSON>Young</PERSON> said.
   Young said he was concerned that recent media reports have
``singled out'' the publicly financed security, and he described
the <PERSON>King</PERSON> family as ``a valuable asset to the city.''
   ``Whatever it takes to see that they function safely and
securely, we have an interest in maintaining,'' he said.
   Fulton County <PERSON>Sheriff Richard B. Lankford</PERSON> said last week he
assigned a deputy full time to the <ORGANIZATION>King Center</ORGANIZATION> to serve as a
``security consultant'' and to protect the <PERSON>King</PERSON> family, including
<PERSON>King</PERSON>'s widow, <PERSON>Coretta Scott King</PERSON>, and his son, <ORGANIZATION>Fulton County
Commissioner Martin Luther King III</ORGANIZATION>.
   Young, who was one of <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s lieutenants in the <ORGANIZATION>Southern
Christian Leadership Conference</ORGANIZATION> and is a member of the <ORGANIZATION>King Center</ORGANIZATION>
board of directors, said the city has contributed about <MONEY>$23,000</MONEY> to
the center this year.
   ``I wish we could do more,'' he added.
   The King Center, visited by an estimated 800,000 people
annually, is one of the state's most popular tourist destinations,
he said.
   The city, <PERSON>Young</PERSON> said, routinely provides police details for such
attractions as the High Museum of Art and <LOCATION>Zoo Atlanta</LOCATION>.
   He added that the city also sends 25 to 50 officers to <LOCATION>Atlanta
Braves</LOCATION> baseball games, where they perform duties ranging from
security and crowd control to traffic direction.
   ``The King Center outdraws all of them, but it brings with it a
unique set of problems, and one of the problems is security,'' he
said. ``It's one of those kinds of places where the nuts seem to
gather.''

   The dreams of the Rev. <PERSON>Martin Luther King Jr.</PERSON> have not been
realized and people should renew their commitment to his struggle,
supporters of the civil rights leader said <DATE>Monday</DATE> during nationwide
memorials on the 20th anniversary of his assassination.
   ``To ignore the past, even if it is painful, is to deny the
hopes and dreams that <PERSON>Martin Luther King</PERSON> lived for and died for,''
said the Rev. <PERSON>Robert Willingham</PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION>Little Rock</ORGANIZATION>,
<LOCATION>Ark.</LOCATION>, chapter of the <ORGANIZATION>NAACP</ORGANIZATION>. ``To look back is critical to our
efforts to move forward.''
   In <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s hometown of <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>, his widow, <PERSON>Coretta Scott King</PERSON>,
led an hour-long observance at his tomb and announced plans for a
march in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> <DATE>Aug. 27</DATE>, the anniversary of a civil rights
march there in which King delivered his famous ``I have a dream''
speech.
   This <DATE>summer</DATE>'s march, she said, will concentrate on developing a
legislative agenda aimed at ending poverty, racism, war and
violence.
   ``We're going to <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> to mobilize a national coalition in
support of a legislative agenda that serves human needs,'' she
said. ``They have slain the dreamer, but we're here to say that
they cannot slay the mighty dream.''
   Also at the ceremony was <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s sister, <PERSON>Christine King Farris</PERSON>.
She recalled that on the day he was shot, ``I thought on that day
how long life would be without <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> ... and here it is, <DATE>20 years
later</DATE>, and we're still trying to perpetuate his legacy ... and his
dream.''
   King was shot by <PERSON>James Earl Ray</PERSON> on <DATE>April 4, 1968</DATE>, while standing
on the balcony of the <ORGANIZATION>Lorraine Hotel</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Memphis</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Tenn</LOCATION>. King was in
<LOCATION>Memphis</LOCATION> to lend support for striking sanitation workers who were
seeking increased wages.
   The Rev. <PERSON>James Lawson</PERSON>, president of the <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> chapter of
the <ORGANIZATION>Southern Christian Leadership Conference</ORGANIZATION>, was in <LOCATION>Memphis</LOCATION> the
day King was shot.
   ``As a local pastor, I led the sanitation strike that brought
<PERSON>Dr. King</PERSON> to <LOCATION>Memphis</LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON>Lawson</PERSON>. ``<PERSON>Dr. King</PERSON> had a very strong
sense that danger was imminent but he proceeded in the interest of
economic justice and human dignity.''
   About 600 people gathered in <LOCATION>Lumberton</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.C.</LOCATION>, to pledge to
continue the struggle for change started by slain Lumbee Indian
leader <PERSON>Julian Pierce</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Robeson County</LOCATION>.
   ``We know from history that a bullet ... can never slay the
dream,'' he said. ``The dream of <PERSON>Julian Pierce</PERSON> is the dream of
<ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King Jr</ORGANIZATION>. And that dream lives,'' said the Rev. <PERSON>Ben
Chavis</PERSON>.
   <PERSON>Pierce</PERSON>, shot to death at his home on <DATE>March 26</DATE> in what
authorities said was a domestic dispute, was running for a <ORGANIZATION>Superior
Court</ORGANIZATION> judgeship. Many Lumbees and blacks in the county say they are
discriminated against, and that they are not represented adequately
in local political offices. The county's population is <PERCENT>37 percent</PERCENT>
Indian, <PERCENT>37 percent</PERCENT> white and <PERCENT>26 percent</PERCENT> black.
   In <LOCATION>Albany</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>, the Rev. <PERSON>Al Sharpton</PERSON> was arrested for refusing
to move out of a road outside the state Capitol. Three people were
arrested with <PERSON>Sharpton</PERSON> and 10 others, including folk singer <PERSON>Pete
Seeger</PERSON>, were detained after refusing to leave a service road.
   Their rally was called to protest state handling of the case of
<PERSON>Tawana Brawley</PERSON>, a black teen-ager who claims she was assaulted by a
group of white men. Sharpton had threatened to shut down state
agencies on the anniversary of <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s death. Sharpton and others
among <PERSON>Miss Brawley</PERSON>'s advisers have refused to let her cooperate
with the state investigation.
   About 200 people representing various religious groups prayed,
shouted and sang outside the <ORGANIZATION>Mobil Oil Corp.</ORGANIZATION> headquarters in
<LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION> in an anti-apartheid demonstration coinciding with the
King observances. The group urged <ORGANIZATION>Mobil</ORGANIZATION> to stop doing business in
<LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>.
   Religious leaders in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> planned an evening service
titled ``Twenty Years Later, We Still Have A Dream.''
   ``Although we have accomplished much, it is not enough to honor
him with memories,'' said <PERSON>Mark Ridley-Thomas</PERSON>, executive leader of
the <ORGANIZATION>SCLC</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>. ``We must renew our commitment to the
struggle for social change for which he so ardently fought.''
   Some civil rights leaders weren't pleased with the progress made
by blacks in American society.
   ``The cup is not half full. It contains only a few drops,'' said
<PERSON>Ronald Hunter</PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION>Erie County</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>, chapter of the
<ORGANIZATION>SCLC</ORGANIZATION>. ``If <PERSON>Dr. King</PERSON> were alive today, he'd be very disillusioned.''
   ``Some things are worse than 20 years ago,'' he said. ``In
addition to high unemployment there are more school dropouts, high
drug and alcohol abuse, more teen-age pregnancy.''
   The civil rights movement is almost at a standstill, and many
young blacks lack the perspective of older civil rights workers,
said <PERSON>Daniel R. Acker</PERSON>, president of the <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>, chapter of
the <ORGANIZATION>National Association</ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION>Advancement of Colored People</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``They never knew the humiliation of <PERSON>Jim Crowism</PERSON>, of `colored
only' drinking fountains, and being forced to ride in the back of
the bus,'' <PERSON>Acker</PERSON> said.
   At least one observance was held overseas.
   About 400 people marched through the center of <LOCATION>Rome</LOCATION> in a
commemoration organized by <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>'s tiny, maverick <ORGANIZATION>Radical Party</ORGANIZATION>.
   Some of the demonstrators carried banners with <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s picture
and others carried multilingual posters calling for an end to
racial discrimination worldwide, a solution to the Palestinian
issue, and the drawing together of nations in a <LOCATION>United States of
Europe</LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Arizona House Passes Martin Luther King Bill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The <ORGANIZATION>Arizona House of Representatives</ORGANIZATION> has approved
a state holiday honoring the slain civil rights leader <PERSON>Martin Luther
King Jr.</PERSON>, leaving legislators to focus their efforts on the state
<ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>.
   The bill, which would designate the third <DATE>Monday</DATE> of each <DATE>January</DATE>
as ``Martin Luther King Civil Rights Day,'' passed the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> in a
35-24 vote <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   Democrat <PERSON>Carolyn Walker</PERSON>, the chief <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> sponsor, said there may
be as many as 17 votes for the bill, which needs 16 to pass.
   ``I have a, shall we say, gut feeling that this may be the
year,'' she said.
   Democratic Gov. <PERSON>Rose Mofford</PERSON>, who supports the King holiday,
issued a statement congratulating the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``I now appeal to the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> for similar, non-divisive passage of
the King legislation so that I may sign it and together we can move
<LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION> forward,'' she said.
   Former Republican Gov. <PERSON>Evan Mecham</PERSON>, who was impeached last <DATE>spring</DATE>
for attempting to thwart a death-threat investigation and misusing
funds, drew fire in <DATE>1987</DATE> for rescinding a holiday honoring King, a
move that prompted a boycott of the state by some organizations that
had planned to hold conventions in <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
   <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King Jr.</ORGANIZATION> borrowed words and ideas
extensively from other sources for his doctoral dissertation and
other writings without giving proper citations, a <ORGANIZATION>Stanford
University</ORGANIZATION> historian says.
   ``Several of <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s academic papers, as well as his
dissertation, contain numerous appropriated passages that can be
defined as plagiarism,'' historian <PERSON>Clayborne Carson</PERSON> said in a story
The Wall Street Journal published today.
   The slain civil rights leader's widow, <PERSON>Coretta Scott King</PERSON>, chose
<PERSON>Carson</PERSON> to lead the <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King Jr</ORGANIZATION>. Papers Project, which she
founded in <DATE>1984</DATE> to gather his papers from locations around the
country and produce a multivolume collection.
   <PERSON>Mrs. King</PERSON>'s spokesman, <PERSON>Steve Klein</PERSON>, said <DATE>today</DATE> that she was
aware of the newspaper story but had no immediate comment on it.
   King's school papers are his most obscure and insignificant
writings, but the discoveries have prompted debate, anguish and
soul-searching among scholars who have worked on the project.
   Associate Editor <PERSON>Ralph Luker</PERSON>, a follower of King who was jailed
during a civil rights protest, said he suffered ``deep anxieties''
over the findings and ``many hours of lost sleep.''
   <PERSON>David Garrow</PERSON>, a member of the project's advisory board and
author of ``Bearing the Cross,'' a Pulitzer Prize-winning biography
of King, said the discovery ``had a tremendously shaking, emotional
impact on me.''
   ``To me, <PERCENT>98 percent</PERCENT> of what makes it most interesting is: Why
did he do it? Was he so insecure that he thought this was the only
way to get by? It's disconcerting, because it is fundamentally,
phenomenally out of character with my entire sense of the man.''
   The questions about his academic work surfaced in late <DATE>1987</DATE>,
nearly 20 years after his death, when evidencewas discovered by a
<ORGANIZATION>Stanford</ORGANIZATION> graduate student who was working for the <ORGANIZATION>King Papers
Project</ORGANIZATION>.
   In some parts of the dissertation <PERSON>King</PERSON> wrote as a doctoral
candidate at <ORGANIZATION>Boston University</ORGANIZATION>, he lifted passages nearly verbatim
from other texts without using any quotation marks or footnotes,
the Journal reported.
   After that discovery, <PERSON>Carson</PERSON> told his staff to check the sources
of nearly of all <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s academic work.
   It became apparent that throughout his seven years of graduate
school, <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s essays, especially in his major field of graduate
study, systematic theology, often borrowed from other sources
without citing them as required by academic policy, the Journal
reported.
   When the problem was found, three project editors and a
half-dozen student researchers worked for nearly two years
annotating all of King's 150 or so academic papers.
   <PERSON>Carson</PERSON> said <PERSON>King</PERSON> likely did not intentionally do anything wrong
by sometimes failing to attribute materials in his writing.
   ``The best evidence for that,'' he said, ``is that he saved his
papers and donated them to an archive - at <LOCATION>B.U.</LOCATION> of all places.''

L.A. CELEBRATES KING'S CAUSE AT PARADES, RALLIES

They marched <DATE>Monday</DATE> -- through the streets of <LOCATION>South Los Angeles</LOCATION>, down the 
boulevards of <LOCATION>Beverly Hills</LOCATION>, even to a small church in <LOCATION>Inglewood</LOCATION> -- to protest 
apartheid, to celebrate civil rights and, above all, to honor the memory of <ORGANIZATION>Dr. 
Martin Luther King Jr</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
It would have been <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s <DATE>61st birthday</DATE>, and Southern Californians celebrated 
the work of the slain civil rights activist by parading down the <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> 
thoroughfare that bears his name, protesting the racism that still exists in 
<LOCATION>America</LOCATION> and abroad, and effectively shutting down an institution that did not 
close for the federal holiday. 
</P>
<P>
Gray skies hinted of rain, but police estimated that 70,000 people braved the 
chill air to watch the fifth annual King Birthday Parade, which began at the 
<ORGANIZATION>Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza</ORGANIZATION>, wound down <LOCATION>King Boulevard</LOCATION> and ended, 3.2 miles 
away, at the county <ORGANIZATION>Museum of Natural History</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Exposition Park</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"Those words 'we shall overcome' go a long way. They're even saying it in 
<LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION>," said a smiling <PERSON>Ivan Jones</PERSON>, 73, as he watched his granddaughters march 
in the parade, which attracted a crowd more than three times the size of last 
year's. "It comes from <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King</ORGANIZATION>. Just keep it in your mind that we 
can do it, that we can overcome it." 
</P>
<P>
"Now we have a black governor, and it has nothing to do with the pigmentation 
of his skin," said <PERSON>Keith Strong</PERSON>, 36, referring to <PERSON>Lawrence Douglas Wilder</PERSON>, the 
newly inaugurated governor of <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION>. "It has to do with his ability. That's 
what <PERSON>Martin Luther King</PERSON> was talking about." 
</P>
<P>
Amid the sounds of marching bands and high school drill teams were many somber 
and poignant declarations of African-American pride. A woman sold "Do the Right 
Thing" buttons and carried a sign that read "I Love Being Black." Another stood 
in the cool air with a sweat shirt that declared, "I Have Come This Far by 
Faith," and a family baked a special birthday cake for <PERSON>Dr. King</PERSON> and sold pieces 
of it, and other food items, from their front lawn. 
</P>
<P>
"I do this for his birthday," said <PERSON>Margie Manyweather</PERSON>, who spent a week 
planning and cooking the sweet potato pies, German chocolate cake and barbecued 
chicken her family sold. "What little money I make, I donate to the homeless." 
</P>
<P>
The image of another civil rights hero, one who has no holiday, also dotted the 
crowd. <PERSON>Gina Temple</PERSON>, 24, kept herself warm in a sweat shirt bearing a likeness 
of Malcolm X, while a vendor nearby sold T-shirts that showed Malcolm X and 
King shaking hands, over the words "Unity Is Strength." 
</P>
<P>
"I think, eventually, it should not be only <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s birthday (that we 
celebrate)," said <PERSON>Donyielle Holley</PERSON>, 24. "It should be a day where we celebrate 
all black leaders." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, while Mayor <PERSON>Tom Bradley</PERSON> rang the <ORGANIZATION>City Hall</ORGANIZATION> bell as part of a 
nationwide, simultaneous bell-ringing ceremony in honor of King, about 120 
activists gathered in front of <ORGANIZATION>Security Pacific National Bank</ORGANIZATION>'s downtown 
headquarters to protest a corporate decision to open more than 550 of its 
offices, despite the federal holiday. 
</P>
<P>
"When we realized that <ORGANIZATION>Security Pacific</ORGANIZATION> stood alone among banks, we thought 
they should be the focus of a protest," said <PERSON>Susan Anderson</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Southern 
Christian Leadership Conference of Greater Los Angeles</ORGANIZATION>. "We are worried that 
the message many businesses and individuals will get because of <ORGANIZATION>Security 
Pacific</ORGANIZATION>'s example is that the holiday is an optional one." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Deborah Lewis</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Security Pacific</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, said that "the sole purpose of 
the decision is to benefit our customers." She added that 20 branches did not 
open <DATE>Monday</DATE>, or later decided to close for the holiday. 
</P>
<P>
After the downtown protest ended, some of the participants drove to <LOCATION>Beverly 
Hills</LOCATION> to join more than 2,000 students and adult activists demonstrating in 
front of the former <ORGANIZATION>South African Consulate</ORGANIZATION> offices on <LOCATION>Wilshire Boulevard</LOCATION>. The 
group then marched along <LOCATION>Wilshire</LOCATION> to the current consulate on <LOCATION>La Cienega 
Boulevard</LOCATION>, where they staged a three-hour rally. 
</P>
<P>
Speakers criticized apartheid in <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> as well as the racism and 
inequities that they say still exist in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Actress <PERSON>Alfre Woodard</PERSON>, directing her words at South African President <PERSON>Frederik 
W. de Klerk</PERSON>, said, "You are dressing up that tired old whore, apartheid, and 
squiring her out to the ball . . . . 
</P>
<P>
"And the shame is that some people in their drunken revelry are willing to 
dance with her, <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
"<PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON>, how dare you qualify freedom by the color of the people who seek 
it?" <PERSON>Woodard</PERSON> said to the audience that had crowded the steps. She was alluding 
to <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> support for the social revolution taking place in <LOCATION>Eastern Europe</LOCATION> while 
ignoring similar struggles in <LOCATION>Central America</LOCATION>. "That is the dirty secret of our 
foreign policy." 
</P>
<P>
A group representing the <ORGANIZATION>Nation of Islam</ORGANIZATION> used the holiday to protest alleged 
<LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> police harassment of blacks during a <DATE>Jan. 3</DATE> fight between 24 
officers and 13 Muslims in the <ORGANIZATION>Crenshaw District</ORGANIZATION>. The incident began after a 
traffic stop and resulted in injuries to several members of each group and the 
arrests of all 13 Muslims. 
</P>
<P>
"We must come together in peace," <PERSON>Malik Muhammad</PERSON>, a member of the Brotherhood 
of the Black Man, told a crowd of about 100 at the rally in <LOCATION>Leimert Park</LOCATION>. "We 
don't have anything against the law. . . . They just didn't approach us in the 
right way, that's all. 
</P>
<P>
Muslim leaders have accused police of provoking the disturbance by 
unnecessarily trying to force blacks to lie down on the pavement. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a meeting with police to discuss the concerns, the 13 arrestees -- all 
members of the brotherhood -- face possible felony charges, according to 
police. 
</P>
<P>
Other holiday events <DATE>Monday</DATE> included a march in <LOCATION>Inglewood</LOCATION> that ended with a 
service at the <ORGANIZATION>First Church of God</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Pulitzer Prize-winning author <PERSON>Toni Morrison</PERSON> gave the keynote speech at the 
<ORGANIZATION>SCLC</ORGANIZATION>'s 13th annual <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King Jr</ORGANIZATION>. Birthday Dinner at the <ORGANIZATION>Bonaventure</ORGANIZATION>.
