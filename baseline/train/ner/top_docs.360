<LEADPARA>  The Stanford Stadium mile record had stood for 11 years, but Kenya's Samuel
Kibiri, racing for Washington State, not only smashed it Saturday, he also
dragged the next two finishers across the line in what would have been record
time, too.;    Kibiri's 3-minute, 57.84-second finish on the climactic day of
the Stanford Track Challenge was nearly two seconds faster than ex-Arizona
State miler Ray Wicksel's 3:59.7 run in 1980. Indiana's Robert Kennedy crossed
second in 3:59.03 and Matt Giusto, the fourth-ranked American in the 1,500
meters last year, was third in 3:59.18.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     <PERSON>PattiSue Plumer</PERSON>, named the world's top woman middle-distance runner last
year by <ORGANIZATION>Track &amp; Field News</ORGANIZATION>, easily won the women's mile in 4:31.53.;    "I
never knew about the record," said <PERSON>Kibiri</PERSON>, whose victory added to the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION>
10 Conference's winning margin over the <ORGANIZATION>Big Ten</ORGANIZATION> in the Pac-10-Big Ten
Challenge portion of the meet. "Yesterday I was having problems with a hip
injury, and I just wanted to run a good race.";    <PERSON>Kibiri</PERSON> was third in the
mile at the recent <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> indoor championships, and his previous best for the
distance was 3:58.41.;    Comfortable pace;  "The pace (set the first two laps
by 800-meter runner <PERSON>Ray Brown</PERSON>) was very comfortable," <PERSON>Kibiri</PERSON> said. "I felt the
runners would leave too fast out of the start, but they never did.";    <ORGANIZATION>Kibiri</ORGANIZATION>
will return this <DATE>summer</DATE> to the Kenyan national team for the African
championships and the world championships in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>, both in <LOCATION>August.</LOCATION>;   
<ORGANIZATION>Plumer</ORGANIZATION>'s race opened what will be a busy outdoor season after a fall and
winter mostly spent off the track. But that respite -- part intentional, part
accidental -- will be her last until after the Olympics next <DATE>summer</DATE> in
<LOCATION>Barcelona.</LOCATION>;    "From now until '92 there's not much down time," she said. "I
can't take two months off this <DATE>fall</DATE> like I did <DATE>last fall</DATE>.";    That layoff was
extended by moving at Thanksgiving, the <LOCATION>Bay Area</LOCATION>'s cold weather at <LOCATION>Christmas</LOCATION>
and flu in <DATE>January</DATE> that tempted her to skip much of the indoor season.;   
"But I didn't because I had already committed to those meets, the tickets had
been bought, the promotions done," she said.;    Middle-distance emphasis; 
Pointing toward The <ORGANIZATION>Athletics Congress</ORGANIZATION> nationals in <DATE>June</DATE> and then <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>,
<PERSON>Plumer</PERSON> said she plans to continue her concentration on the 3,000 meters and
5,000 meters, in which she earned her top ranking last year.;    She's working
this <DATE>spring</DATE> as an assistant to Stanford track coach <PERSON>Brooks Johnson</PERSON>, who is her
personal coach, in addition to her law practice.;    "I wanted to go out a
little faster, a 2:12 instead of a 2:14. But running by myself and it being so
breezy, it was a good run," she said.;    "I'm frankly happy with a 4:31 on
this track (her personal best is 4:29). I trained pretty hard for the last
four weeks. I'm not ecstatic by any means, but this is a tough place for me to
run. On one hand, I don't want to lose on my home course. But this is where I
train every day, so it's tough coming in here and feeling like I'm not just on
another training run.";    <PERSON>Plumer</PERSON> won against the wind, measured at 3.1 meters
per second in the women's 100 meters shortly before her race, and outdistanced
<PERSON>Tina Colebrook</PERSON>, second in 4:39.23, and <PERSON>Ceci Hopp</PERSON>, a former teammate at
<ORGANIZATION>Stanford</ORGANIZATION>, third in 4:41.99.;    That wind, however, did little to slow
<ORGANIZATION>Stanford</ORGANIZATION> sprinter <PERSON>Chryste Gaines.</PERSON>;    <PERSON>Gaines</PERSON> won the Pac-10-Big Ten women's
100 in 11.67 seconds, two-hundredths off her personal best, defeating <ORGANIZATION>Ohio
State</ORGANIZATION>'s Sue <PERSON>Walton</PERSON> in 11.98.;    The Pac-10 women defeated the Big Ten women

How I Stay Fit  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     WEIGHT: 128;    PERSONAL: Single and lives in <LOCATION>Menlo Park</LOCATION>;    OCCUPATION:
Corporate legal assistant for <LOCATION>Palo Alto</LOCATION> firm of <ORGANIZATION>Wilson, Sonsini, Goodrich &amp;
Rosati.</ORGANIZATION>;    FITNESS BACKGROUND: <PERSON>Goldfarb</PERSON> says she is naturally athletic
because everything she has tried -- like snow skiing at age 4 -- she has done
well. As a youngster, her playtime was always centered on running games and
swimming. At 13, she took to tennis.;    "When you run or swim you don't have
to think about what you're doing. But in tennis, there is a mental challenge.
You always have to be thinking about strategy, what you need to do to win and
be able to adjust your game as you go through the process." After a few
lessons, she played pretty well.;    She'd taken quite a few lessons by the
time she entered high school. While playing competitively during the school
year, she also ran and worked out with weights. Every <DATE>summer</DATE>, she attended
tennis camp and swam.;    All was fine for a while with her routine at the
<ORGANIZATION>University of California</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Berkeley</LOCATION>. She was playing intramural tennis three
times a week, swimming laps, using her bike for transportation and running
four to five miles on pavement four times a week. In spite of discomfort in
her ankle, she continued running until "incredible shooting pains" forced her
to seek medical attention. It took two surgeries, casts, crutches and nearly
four years before her rehabilitation from what turned out to be stress
fractures was complete.;    And it was another two years before she developed
the confidence to step on the court again. To deal with the disappointment,
she swam six days a week during her long recovery. "It got awfully old not
being able to do what I wanted to do, but at least I had that.";    REGIMEN:
<PERSON>Goldfarb</PERSON> returned to tennis a year ago and has been playing four times a week.
A "power player" and a "hard hitter," she says she prefers a singles match
because she gets a better workout. She and her <ORGANIZATION>United States Tennis
Association</ORGANIZATION> A-ranked women's team won a divisional championship recently. "The
competition is very local for now.";    She takes an aerobics class once a
week and, to give her body a break from her high-impact activities, she still
swims a mile once or twice a week and enjoys bike riding with friends on
weekends.;    RESULTS: <PERSON>Goldfarb</PERSON> hasn't quite shaken the fear that she could
re-injure her ankle. "But I've learned to listen to what my body tells me. And
no more running for me. I used to enjoy it, but now I don't even want to
try.";    GOALS: "To play tennis consistently and avoid mistakes.";   
OBSTACLES: "When I take the game too seriously and feel bummed after losing a
match, I have to remind myself how lucky I am to be playing again." Also
frustrating, she says, is getting tied up at work and having to miss a planned
workout.;    TIPS AND COMMENTS: "I like to swim and bicycle, but what I like
the most is tennis." If she had to give it up, she'd replace it with other
activities -- like more swimming and bicycling, she says, because, in addition
to staying healthy and feeling fit, working out is her favorite way to have
fun and make friends.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>     WEIGHT: 118 pounds;   PERSONAL: Single and lives in Mountain View;  
OCCUPATION: Senior technical writer who was laid off last month.;   FITNESS
BACKGROUND: There weren't girls to "pal around with" in the rural area of
<LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> where she grew up, so Apichell joined the boys for football,
baseball and basketball. She played varsity basketball as a freshman, pitched
and played shortstop for the softball team and would have loved the
opportunity to excel at track and field, she says, because she loved to run.
But the school didn't have a track. During the <DATE>summer</DATE> she worked as a
lifeguard, taught swimming and competed in springboard diving.;   Except for
intramurals, sports were on the back burner during college because "my
demanding English major required reading too many books and writing too many
papers." But during the summers, while her friends were working as waitresses,
she used the facilities at the swim and tennis club where she worked.;  
Before returning to school to earn a second degree in journalism, <PERSON>Apichell</PERSON>
taught high school English, coached basketball, ran in 5K and 10K races and
played rugby for the <ORGANIZATION>University of Maryland</ORGANIZATION> for eight years. She also taught
freshman English at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Florida</ORGANIZATION>, where she played rugby, took up
triathlons and competed in co-ed soccer.;   It was "all soccer" when she moved
to <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> in <DATE>1983</DATE> and joined an over-30 women's team. Because the goal of
the team was to win the national cup, they averaged three two-hour practices a
week year-round. And many of the practices were preceded by four-mile runs to
warm up. In <DATE>1988</DATE> they made it to the national tournament, but lost by one
goal.;   As new teammates in their early 30s seemed to be getting "younger and
faster," Apichell started looking for new outlets. While phasing out soccer,
she found "bicycle heaven" in the <LOCATION>Bay Area</LOCATION> and has been riding and running
ever since. The past year, she completed about 10 100-mile century rides and
placed in several biathlon competitions that combine running and bicycling.;  
REGIMEN: When employed, <PERSON>Apichell</PERSON> ran three to four miles every day during her
lunch hour and rode her bike in the evening until sundown. Now that it's dark
in the <TIME>evening</TIME>, she has upped her daytime distance to six miles and has
replaced cycling in the evening with a few hours of tennis. Weekends are still
the same, she says -- bike rides of 40 to 60 miles each day along steep routes
that include Page Mill and <LOCATION>Kings Mountain</LOCATION> roads, <LOCATION>Tunitas Creek</LOCATION> and Mount
Tamalpais.;   RESULTS: Being in good physical condition has carried over
mentally and spiritually, she says. "My health is excellent, my self-esteem is
high and, when I go into a job interview, I feel confident and proud of my
abilities.";   GOALS: To win a biathlon -- because second place is not good
enough -- and to be able to finish all five mountain passes in the 147-mile
<LOCATION>Markleeville Death Ride</LOCATION> in <DATE>May</DATE>. "And I've always wanted to try kayaking.";  
OBSTACLES: "Sometimes I wish I had a buddy to run or bicycle with regularly.
But the independence is nice. I have from sunrise to sundown to plan my
workout.";   TIPS AND COMMENTS: "I am not a quitter. Sports has taught me to
hang in there until the whistle is blown. I don't give up."  </TEXT>

<TEXT>     WEIGHT: 170 pounds;    PERSONAL: Married 48 years. He has three children,
four grandchildren and lives in <LOCATION>Portola Valley.</LOCATION>;    OCCUPATION: Owner, <ORGANIZATION>Alpha I
Insurance Brokers Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Sunnyvale</LOCATION>;    FITNESS BACKGROUND: Growing up in
<LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION>, he spent a lot of time bodysurfing and playing volleyball
on the beach at <LOCATION>Santa Monica</LOCATION>. "In those days, we'd chip in a nickel each for
<MONEY>20 cents</MONEY>' worth of gas to get there and back. When we didn't have enough
money, we'd ride our bikes like hell for 20 miles to get there instead.";   
He's never been a speedster, he says, but he's been active and competitive
throughout his life in many sports -- with one exception, the time his B-17
was shot down during World War II and he spent nine months in a German prison.
Normally, he played touch football on weekends and did a lot of snow skiing
with his family. But when a two-man volleyball game in the sand "ruined my
weekend" 26 years ago, he decided his physical routine was insufficient. He
started running in the mornings and felt a tremendous difference right away,
he says.;    REGIMEN: <PERSON>Connor</PERSON> is still running 2 1/2 to three miles starting at
<TIME>5:15 a.m</TIME>. When he gets home, he does 200 strokes on a rowing machine, a series
of sit-ups, leg-ups, push-ups, stretching exercises, a weight routine with
40-pound barbells and by 6:10 he's in the shower.;    <PERSON>Connor</PERSON> started playing
tennis at 50. "I play every chance I get, and every <DATE>Saturday</DATE> and <DATE>Sunday</DATE>
morning with a group of younger guys." He's a proficient skier who, since the
age of 66, has won gold, silver and bronze medals -- plus a few personal
"crash and burn awards" -- in <ORGANIZATION>NASTAR</ORGANIZATION> downhill racing. He says he's only a
recreational swimmer, but he placed first in 50-meter freestyle swimming and
second in tennis in the Palo Alto/Stanford Senior Olympic Games two years
ago.;    "Alcohol makes me feel like I'm pulling a trailer," he says, so he's
given it up. And because he believes it's important not to overeat, "I never
go back for seconds.";    RESULTS: "It's been a lot of fun feeling 40 for the
past 30 years!";    GOALS: "To live long enough to get even with my kids by
seeing their children turn into teen-agers.";    OBSTACLES: "A flu bug or an
injury. It's hard to start all over again if you lay off too long. I don't run
if it rains, but I think I live in the eye of the hurricane because it never
seems to rain when I run.";    TIPS AND COMMENTS: "Fifty years ago I thought
it would be great to live to the year <DATE>2000</DATE> and, if I can buy some more time,
it looks like I'm going to make it. But if it ended tomorrow, I'd have had a
great time."  </TEXT>

Professional tennis player;    FITNESS BACKGROUND: While growing up in a house
next door to the Los Altos Golf and <ORGANIZATION>Country Club</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Simone</PERSON> says he loved to
watch people play tennis. At age 7, he got his turn with a racket he retrieved
from a trash can there. For the next two years, <PERSON>Simone</PERSON> collected tennis balls
on the courts in exchange for lessons. He played well in all the sports
offered in school, he says, but during the summers he lived on the tennis
court for 4 to 6 hours each day.;    "I always felt there was something
special about me as an athlete," says <PERSON>Simone</PERSON>. And it was confirmed when he was
offered a scholarship after his junior year in high school to <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>'s
prestigious <ORGANIZATION>Bollettieri Tennis Academy</ORGANIZATION> -- "a concentration camp," he says,
referring to its intense program.;    After graduation from high school, he
competed in the French circuit before returning to <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> to continue his
education. At <ORGANIZATION>Foothill College</ORGANIZATION> he was part of the second-ranked doubles team
in the nation among junior colleges. This impressed the <ORGANIZATION>University of Arkansas</ORGANIZATION>
and earned him another scholarship. Simone was there a year, earning A's and
B's and juggling his studies, his sport and his social life, when he decided
to quit -- temporarily -- a year short of earning degrees in philosophy and
psychology in order to pursue tennis professionally.;    For the past year and
a half, he has competed in satellite circuits throughout the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and
abroad. His goal is to qualify for the <ORGANIZATION>Volvo</ORGANIZATION> men's tournament in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>
next year. He's currently ranked 787th in the world.;    REGIMEN: After a
stretching and stationary bicycle workout at an athletic club six mornings a
week, he's on the court by <TIME>9 a.m.</TIME> for 2 1/2 hours of tennis. He spends two
hours, three afternoons a week with his coach in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>. And when he
gets home, he runs five to seven 6-minute miles around a track. (If he's
tired, he slows his pace to a 7- or 8-minute mile.) An hour of weight training
at the club on alternative days is followed by speed and balance drills on the
tennis court with an aerobics teacher. Because the sport is so intense, he has
started practicing yoga to learn to relax. He sleeps from <TIME>9 p.m.</TIME> to 7 a.m
during the week, but on <DATE>Sundays</DATE>, "My racket and tennis shoes are locked in the
closet!";    RESULTS: "I feel like a gladiator with a net. Everything is in
balance physically, mentally, nutritionally and holistically and I am ready to
win.";    GOALS: "To play center court against the top seed at <LOCATION>Wimbledon</LOCATION>. And
I'll have to win more than once -- otherwise, people will think it was a
fluke!";    OBSTACLES: "Some mornings I wish it was raining because I don't
want to get out of bed. But because I have pushed myself to the limit many
times, I know what my body can do and when it needs a rest.";    TIPS AND
COMMENTS: "My full-time love and commitment is to tennis for now. I've always
been a good student, so when my peak has passed professionally, I will finish
school."  </TEXT>

PEOPLE: DISTANCE RUNNER: 49 ONLY A NUMBER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT J. VIDA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At a time when most men are slowing down, <PERSON>Jurgen Ankenbrand</PERSON>, 49, is stepping up 
the pace. 
</P>
<P>
He recently was one of 14 men and two women out of a field of 22 who completed 
the torturous 146-mile Death Valley-to-Mt. Whitney run. 
</P>
<P>
Now he wants to visit <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> for a 50-mile race alongside the canal. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the kind of thing I'm looking for, something different," said the 
<LOCATION>Fountain Valley</LOCATION> man who started competitive running only three years ago, about 
the same time that he was divorced. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to do something to use up my energy," said Germany-born Ankenbrand, who 
claims he never participated in sports as a youngster. Or for that matter, 
until he was 30 years old. 
</P>
<P>
"I was always working and never had time for sports," he said in a thick German 
accent. 
</P>
<P>
Before his current job as food services director for <ORGANIZATION>El Acanto Convalescent 
Home</ORGANIZATION> in the <ORGANIZATION>City of Industry</ORGANIZATION>, Ankenbrand worked as a chef at some of the 
leading hotels in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"I got tired of working nights and weekends. It didn't leave much time for 
other things," said the one-time food services director at <LOCATION>Cal State Long 
Beach</LOCATION>, where co-workers urged him to try long-distance running. 
</P>
<P>
Ankenbrand had been playing seven sets of tennis every <DATE>Sunday</DATE> for 20 years with 
the same partner (<PERSON>Don Ogden</PERSON> of Orange), "so they thought I was in good enough 
shape to run a marathon." 
</P>
<P>
That was three years ago and without much training, Ankenbrand has run in 16 
marathons in an average time of 4 hours and 10 minutes, finishing them all. 
</P>
<P>
But he has cut his tennis playing to only five sets each <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, noting that 
"tennis is now my second sport." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike other marathoners, who run upwards of 100 miles a week, "I don't like 
regimented workouts. Maybe I'm lazy," he said, noting that he runs only 20 
miles a week, in training or not. 
</P>
<P>
However, at this point in his life, Ankenbrand is getting bored with marathons. 
</P>
<P>
"It's no longer a challenge," he said, pointing out that <PERCENT>90%</PERCENT> of all marathon 
runners finish. 
</P>
<P>
"I need something more challenging," said <PERSON>Ankenbrand</PERSON>, who has run the <LOCATION>Los 
Angeles</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Long Beach</LOCATION> marathons and two 50-mile races this year. 
</P>
<P>
That was the reason for the 146-mile Death Valley run last month. 
</P>
<P>
"It was my most challenging race and there were times when I wanted to stop," 
he admits. "The heat was up to 115 degrees and I had so many blisters on my 
feet." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the other runners in the international field of competitors dropped 
out. Most of the other athletes were in their 30s. 
</P>
<P>
"I was hurting and my body was telling me to quit, but I had the determination 
and will power you get from maturity," he said. "I just kept going." 
</P>
<P>
It's that philosophy that keeps Ankenbrand running. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to have a positive attitude," he said. "It has never occurred to me 
that I would not finish a race." 
</P>
<P>
And now, <PERSON>Ankenbrand</PERSON> said, all his races will be 50 miles or longer and he feels 
his age is not a factor. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm 49, but I think of myself as younger than that," he said. "The number 49 
doesn't mean anything to me. It's just a number." 
</P>
<P>
And just to prove it, he plans to compete in a triathlon in <DATE>August</DATE>, the 
100-mile Angeles Crest Trail Run in <DATE>September</DATE> and the San Juan 50-Mile Trail 
Run in <DATE>November</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Ankenbrand has also learned that rewards are not substantial for long-distance 
running. 
</P>
<P>
He received a T-shirt for finishing the 146-mile Death Valley-Mt. Whitney Run. 
</P>
<P>
Acknowledgments -- <PERSON>Suzanne Schultz</PERSON>, who teaches special education students at 
<ORGANIZATION>Springbrook Elementary School</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Irvine</LOCATION>, was named Teacher of the Year by the 
school and later received a letter from <PERSON>Barbara Bush</PERSON>, lauding her for the 
honor. "Thank you for caring," wrote the First Lady.

<BYLINE>By SHEILA NORMAN-CULP</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   <PERSON>Jack Nicklaus</PERSON> can scorch the fairways like
practically no one else, but this month he became just another
statistic in a growing trend.
   <PERSON>Nicklaus</PERSON>, who turned 50 on <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, is now eligible to join the
PGA Seniors tour. He's also joining _ albeit with not quite as much
fanfare _ the exploding number of older Americans who compete in
age-group sports.
   The attraction is simple: try your hardest, be your best, and in
five to 10 years be reborn into an older group. Masters swimmers,
for example, compete in five-year intervals up to 90-94. The <ORGANIZATION>United
States Tennis Federation</ORGANIZATION> sanctions matches for men 85 and older and
women 75 and older. Age-group competitions also are organized in
bicycling, track and field, marathons and triathlons.
   The system encourages older Americans to keep competing, because
at least once every few years they get to be the youngest kid on
the block.
   ``You like to come in at the bottom of your age group and blow
them away,'' said <PERSON>Dr. George McVey</PERSON>, 62, of <LOCATION>Rochester</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>, who has
competed for 17 years in masters swimming and has been
internationally ranked in the breaststroke.
   ``It's amazing _ the condition of these people,'' he said of
those attending national masters swim meets.
``Seventy-five-year-olds can go up and down the pool like you
wouldn't believe.''
   ``A couple of years ago, our oldest category was 50-plus,'' said
<PERSON>Gary Scott</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Triathlon Federation@USA</ORGANIZATION>. ``Now it's 70-plus.''
   These older triathletes aren't running mini-events, either. They
are in the same grueling races attempted by athletes 50 years their
junior.
   ``We had one 64-year-old woman who finished in a decent time at
the Ironman,'' <PERSON>Scott</PERSON> said. ``She beat a lot of men in their
thirties.''
   The Ironman is one of the world's most prestigious triathlons,
held in <LOCATION>Kailua-Kona</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>, each year. The woman, <PERSON>Joanita Reed</PERSON> of
<LOCATION>San Antonio</LOCATION>, swam a 2.4-mile ocean race, cycled 112 miles over
hills and ran a 26.2-mile marathon, all in the same day. She
finished in 14 hours, 31 minutes and 55 seconds.
   ``We have experienced a dramatic increase in masters riders in
the last five years,'' agreed <PERSON>Kyle Woodlief</PERSON>, spokesman for the
<ORGANIZATION>United States Cycling Federation</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Colorado Springs</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Colo.</LOCATION> ``Our
oldest licensed racer is 93.''
   That rider, <PERSON>Fred Knoller</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Lauderdale-By-The-Sea</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla.</LOCATION>,
competed in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Nationals from <DATE>1976 to 1985</DATE>, when he was 89.
Knoller has stopped competing but is still a big fan of the move
toward smaller age-group categories.
   ``When I was in my 50's, I was still racing against
40-year-olds,'' he said. He keeps his membership to get the
newsletter and find out how friends are doing. ``Some of these boys
60, 65, are really good. Real pros.''
   Last <DATE>June</DATE>, the cream of American senior athletes gathered to go
for the gold in <LOCATION>St. Louis</LOCATION>, at the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. National Senior Olympics</ORGANIZATION>.
The 3,452 athletes, ranging from 55 to 91, earned the chance to
compete through strong performances at qualifying meets, where more
than 100,000 seniors tested their mettle.
   ``You know the saying, `If you don't use it, you lose it,'' said
<PERSON>Sylvia Auerbach Swartz</PERSON>, 77, who with her sisters Rose, 74, and
<LOCATION>Pearl</LOCATION>, 68, earned 12 medals at the Senior Olympics. ``It's
important not to let the joints get stiff. You've got to keep them
going.''
   Swartz, of <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, said a youthful diet of volleyball,
softball, basketball, lacrosse and speedball, along with some
middle-aged tennis and ping-pong laid the base for her success.
Medals in field events came from weekly training, pointers from
local coaches, and encouragement from her sisters.
   ``We don't compete against each other, though,'' she said.
``That's why we are still talking.''
   At the <ORGANIZATION>VIII World Veterans Championships</ORGANIZATION> last <DATE>summer</DATE> in <LOCATION>Eugene</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Ore.</LOCATION> _ billed as the largest track meet in history, former Olympic
athletes faced top-flight but unknown competitors from around the
world. Many of the 4,950 athletes produced times and distances that
were the talk of the meet.
   <PERSON>Paula Schneiderhan</PERSON> of <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION> produced a world record in
the womens' 65-69 200-meter sprint with a time of 31.65 seconds.
   Although seniors are still a rather small segment of the sports
population, one industry expert says when they do enjoy a sport,
they go at it with gusto.
   ``The mature market incidence in most sports is pretty low,''
said <PERSON>Harvey Lauer</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>American Sports Data Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a
research firm in <LOCATION>Hartsdale</LOCATION>.
   ``But if you look at the people who do run, for example, and are
over 55, they do it with a vengeance,'' he said. ``Tennis players
over 55 play tennis more than tennis players in general. It's a
time factor.''
   Although some age-group seniors were top athletes in their prime
_ like <PERSON>Rose Auerbach</PERSON>, national AAU javelin champ in <DATE>1937</DATE> and <DATE>1938</DATE> _
many more found the joy of competition much later in life. The
80-to-84 category, for example, is the fastest-growing age group at
<ORGANIZATION>U.S. Masters Swimming</ORGANIZATION> meets.
   <PERSON>Dan Gruender</PERSON>, the president of <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Masters Swimming</ORGANIZATION>, began
competing only after following his wife, <PERSON>Edie</PERSON>, to <ORGANIZATION>Masters</ORGANIZATION> swim
meets. At 61, <PERSON>Mrs. Gruender</PERSON> is internationally ranked in the
butterfly, freestyle and individual medley.
   ``As the greying of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> takes place, people realize that
staying active is the one way to improve the quality of your life.
It's also very satisfying. And that's what it's all about,'' he
said. ``Self-improvement is the touchstone we push. We don't care
if it takes you 3 minutes to swim a lap. Next time make it 2:59.''

COLLEGE NOTEBOOK: TOP ATHLETES EAGER TO TRY FAST TRACK AT UCSD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM LINDGREN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What started out as a "last chance" track and field meet for college athletes 
to gain national qualifying times is turning into an international gathering of 
world-class talent. 
</P>
<P>
UC <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> is host for the meet at <TIME>10 a.m.</TIME> <DATE>Saturday</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
It was designed as an opportunity for college athletes to qualify for their 
national meets. But word got around to some top-notch talent that <ORGANIZATION>UCSD</ORGANIZATION>'s new 
state-of-the-art track was again going to be made available. 
</P>
<P>
Soon, <PERSON>Brazilian Joaquim Cruz</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>American Ocky Clark</ORGANIZATION> wanted in on the 800-meter 
run. Likewise, <PERSON>Steve Scott</PERSON>, the American record-holder in the mile, and <PERSON>Dub 
Myers</PERSON>, the former <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> champion from <LOCATION>Oregon</LOCATION>, wanted to run the 1,500. 
</P>
<P>
Canadians <PERSON>Ray Lazdins</PERSON> and <PERSON>Rob McManus</PERSON>, conveniently training in the area, 
decided to enter the discus. 
</P>
<P>
But the kicker might be a small contingent of Estonian javelin throwers, who 
came to <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> to begin training for the European season. Sulev Lepik, 
<PERSON>Meelis Jaarv</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Toivo Moorast</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Donald Sild</PERSON> will compete in the their 
specialty. 
</P>
<P>
They will also be holding a javelin clinic this afternoon at <TIME>1:30</TIME> at <ORGANIZATION>UCSD</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Juri Tamm</PERSON>, bronze medalist for the <ORGANIZATION>USSR</ORGANIZATION> in the hammer throw in <LOCATION>Seoul</LOCATION>, will also 
be on hand today. He and world-renowned coach <PERSON>Anatoli Bondartchouk</PERSON> conducted a 
hammer clinic <DATE>Monday</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
"These guys (Soviets) are the lords of hammer throwing," said <PERSON>Tony Salerno</PERSON>, 
<ORGANIZATION>UCSD</ORGANIZATION> throwing coach. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, <ORGANIZATION>Point Loma Nazarene</ORGANIZATION> freshman <PERSON>Ronnie Skold</PERSON> won six events -- the 100, 
200, long jump and triple jump, the 100 hurdles and 400 relay -- at the first 
City Collegiate Championships at <ORGANIZATION>UCSD</ORGANIZATION>. He could conceivably enter eight -- 
adding the 400 hurdles and 1,600 relay -- in the <ORGANIZATION>NAIA District III</ORGANIZATION> meet but 
probably will not enter the sprints. 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>San Diego State</LOCATION> junior <PERSON>Mike Magruder</PERSON> had just two at-bats with one single and a 
run batted in heading into his first start in <DATE>Saturday</DATE>'s opening game of a 
doubleheader against <LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Magruder responded by going two for four with a double and a home run -- rare 
because of the way it happened. 
</P>
<P>
In the sixth inning with two on, <PERSON>Magruder</PERSON> was instructed to bunt to move the 
runners over, but <LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION> was thinking the same the thing and had both the 
first baseman and third baseman charging. 
</P>
<P>
Magruder squared to bunt, noticed what was going on and pulled his bat back. 
The result was a three-run homer over the left center field fence. 
</P>
<P>
What are the odds of such an occurence? Ask <PERSON>Magruder</PERSON>. He's an engineering major 
who graduated first in his class at both <LOCATION>Ellensburg</LOCATION> High in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Taft 
Community College</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Ed Collins</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>University of San Diego</ORGANIZATION> was named the District <PERSON>VIII</PERSON> coach of 
the year by the <ORGANIZATION>Intercollegiate Tennis Coaches Assn</ORGANIZATION>. Collins is under 
consideration for national coach of the year. 
</P>
<P>
In 12 years at <ORGANIZATION>USD</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Collins</PERSON> is 262-119, including 21-5 this year. The Toreros, 
champions of the <ORGANIZATION>West Coast Conference</ORGANIZATION>, are ranked 17th and should be selected 
for the <ORGANIZATION>NCAA Tournament</ORGANIZATION> next week. 
</P>
<P>
The women's tennis teams at <ORGANIZATION>SDSU</ORGANIZATION> (ranked 12th) and USD (14th) are expected to 
receive <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> bids this week. 
</P>
<P>
SDSU won the <ORGANIZATION>Big West Conference</ORGANIZATION> title for the fifth year in a row last week in 
<LOCATION>Ojai</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Carol Plunkett</PERSON> was chosen the Big West coach of the year. 
</P>
<P>
USD finished second in the <ORGANIZATION>WCC</ORGANIZATION> tournament, but not until <ORGANIZATION>Pepperdine</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Ginger 
Helgeson</PERSON> defeated <ORGANIZATION>USD</ORGANIZATION>'s Sakolwan Kacharoen, 3-6, 6-1, 6-4, in the singles final 
<DATE>Sunday</DATE> at the <ORGANIZATION>San Diego Tennis &amp; Racquet Club</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The tournament was held two weekends ago at <ORGANIZATION>St. Mary</ORGANIZATION>'s, but rain caused the 
delay of the singles and doubles finals. Kacharoen, a sophomore from <LOCATION>Bangkok</LOCATION> 
and seeded seventh, could have given USD a tie if she had upset top-seeded 
<PERSON>Helgeson</PERSON>, who is ranked fourth in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
In the two-year existence of the <ORGANIZATION>Pacific Coast Volleyball Conference</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Nate 
Brown</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>UCSD</ORGANIZATION> has been selected the player of the year twice. And <PERSON>Brown</PERSON> is just 
a sophomore. UCSD went undefeated for the second year in a row and won the PCVC 
Tournament <DATE>Saturday</DATE> at <LOCATION>Santa Clara</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
UCSD's women's water polo team is No. 1 ranked and seeded first heading into 
the <ORGANIZATION>USA National Tournament</ORGANIZATION> <DATE>this weekend</DATE> at <ORGANIZATION>Brown University</ORGANIZATION>. UCSD is 21-0-1.

<LEADPARA>  The Pac-10-Big Ten challenge is a gimmick. Even Stanford track coach Brooks
Johnson concedes that. The question is whether the gimmick is a
crowd-pleaser.;    For Johnson, the three-day Track Challenge that begins this
afternoon at Stanford Stadium presents solutions to a couple of critical
problems. It's an attempt to focus public attention on track. And it's an
attempt to make money.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> says the sport needs both badly, and among the 3,500 athletes
expected to compete are several <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> champions and Olympians he hopes will
boost the gate and give television something entertaining to broadcast.;   
"Track and field has been the object of too much media-bashing lately because
our meets are dying," <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> said. "Non-revenue (college) sports are going to
have to pull their own wagon or stay parked. If they don't, universities are
going to eliminate non-revenue sports as we know them.";    The athletes will
represent 35 colleges and more than 200 high schools.;    But the key is the
Pac-10-Big Ten rivalry <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, which actually will be played out by athletes
from <ORGANIZATION>Stanford</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Oregon</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Washington State</ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> 10 Conference
against those from <ORGANIZATION>Ohio State</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Michigan State</ORGANIZATION> of the <ORGANIZATION>Big
Ten.</ORGANIZATION>;    The Pac-10-Big Ten aspect enabled <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> to sell his meet to the
<ORGANIZATION>Pacific Sports Network</ORGANIZATION>, a cable TV producer, which will televise portions of
the meet live or tape-delayed to about 40 states. And TV brought in a
sponsor.;    "I think by the time we start selling tickets, we will have
covered the rest of our costs," <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> said. "I just hope we'll have good
weather.";    The Pac-10-Big Ten competition will be in a men's and women's
two-mile relay, men's and women's 100 meters, men's and women's shuttle
hurdles relay, men's and women's mile and men's 3,000-meter steeplechase.;   
In addition, there will be invitational miles for women and men, with
Olympians <PERSON>PattiSue Plumer</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jeff Atkinson</PERSON> heading the respective fields.
There will also be a 40-yard dash for football players including <PERSON>Glyn Milburn</PERSON>
of <LOCATION>Stanford</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Sheldon Canley</PERSON> of <LOCATION>San Jose State</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Mike Mayweather</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> and

SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: AZTECS USE HOME RUNS TO SWEEP BYU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The knock against <ORGANIZATION>San Diego State</ORGANIZATION>'s baseball team this season has been its lack

8/23/91, pg. 2D);  Because of an editor's error, the sequence of events in the
World's Toughest Triathlon at Lake Tahoe on Saturday was incorrect in a
graphic in Thursday's Venture section. The swimming segment will be followed
by cycling and then running.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     <PERSON>Dexter Dobberpuhl</PERSON> watched her husband, <PERSON>Ken</PERSON>, finish second in his age
division (he's 42) last year and figured, "Why should he have all the fun?" So
this year both of them are participating.;    Whether the World's Toughest
Triathlon actually is the world's toughest triathlon may be arguable. But none
of the 500 participants has any doubt that it is a very tough race.;    The
first leg is a two-mile swim in <LOCATION>Lake Tahoe</LOCATION>. The lake sits at 6,200 feet, well
above the 5,000-foot level where most athletes begin to feel the effects of
altitude.;    In addition, water temperature ranges between 58 and 62 degrees,
cold enough so organizers require full wet suits and neoprene swim caps for
the athletes.;    Leg two is a 100-mile bike ride. This isn't just another
"century" ride, it is 100 miles of grueling pedaling that climbs over three
Sierra peaks for a total vertical gain of 7,173 feet. Once again, altitude
plays a crucial part since the climbs are to the tops of Monitor Pass at 8,134
feet and Luther Pass, 7,740 feet high.;    These passes are included in the
infamous <LOCATION>Markleeville</LOCATION> "Death Ride" -- a climb over Monitor, Luther and <LOCATION>Ebbetts</LOCATION>
passes that is known as one of the toughest cycling events around. A number of
the athletes taking part in the "World's Toughest," including <PERSON>Zeman</PERSON> and <PERSON>Dexter</PERSON>
and <PERSON>Ken Dobberpuhl</PERSON>, did the "Death Ride" as part of their preparation.;    The
final leg of the race is an 18.6-mile run. The total vertical climb is 1,700
feet, but 1,000 of it occurs in one mile, up a trail of switchbacks on <ORGANIZATION>Angora
Ridge</ORGANIZATION>. Coming after the swim and cycle ride, it is a killer for the athletes,
the place where many drop out.;    TOP ATHLETES, and some teams, finish the
race in just over eight hours. The last finisher should be across the line at
about 15 hours. There are cutoff times for the swim, cycling and running
portions -- those who haven't finished the leg by that time are pulled from
the race.;    <LOCATION>Pollock</LOCATION>, from <LOCATION>Claremont</LOCATION>, has been racing in triathlons for seven
years and has taken part in the famous <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION> Ironman four times. Her best
finish was second in her age division.;    Last year she took part in in the
"World's Toughest" for the first time. "It licked me last year," she says. "I
got in 10 minutes late on the bike leg, so I couldn't run.";    At 59,
organizers say she is the oldest woman ever to take part in the race. She's
been doing triathlons for seven years.;    "I had a disc removed from my spine
10 years ago," <PERSON>Pollock</PERSON> says. "Two years after that I met Jesus and he healed
me completely. I started running, cycling and swimming through a co-worker and
got interested in the endurance events.";    Her 24-year-old son isn't
interested in triathlons -- "he wants to be a pro tennis player" -- and her
husband is just a "good rooter.";    <PERSON>Zeman</PERSON>, 28, got the bug to try the
"World's Toughest" two years ago when he watched it.;    <PERSON>Zeman</PERSON>, who owns a
construction firm in <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION>, said he's been training heavily since May.;   
"I've been working my way up, I'm ready," he said. "I did the <LOCATION>Markleeville</LOCATION>
Death Ride, so I'm not too worried about the altitude. After that ride I felt
the World's Toughest would be a piece a cake.";    The Dobberpuhls, who are
from <LOCATION>Concord</LOCATION>, have been taking part in triathlons together since <DATE>1982</DATE>. "<PERSON>Ken</PERSON>
took part last year, and I was totally inspired," <PERSON>Dexter Dobberpuhl</PERSON> said. "I
have a hard time watching, so I decided, why should he have all the fun?"  </TEXT>

ARREOLA LOOKING FOR FAST FINISH; 
</P>
<P>
CROSS-COUNTRY: NORTHRIDGE SENIOR EXPRESSES DISAPPOINTMENT WITH HER SEASON 
HEADING INTO DIVISION I CHAMPIONSHIPS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
No <ORGANIZATION>Cal State Northridge</ORGANIZATION> athlete appeared as prepared for the move from the <ORGANIZATION>NCAA 
Division II</ORGANIZATION> ranks to Division I this fall as distance runner <PERSON>Darcy Arreola</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
Arreola, the <DATE>1989</DATE> Division II cross-country champion, had won three individual 
Division II track titles, had earned nine Division II All-American certificates 
in track and cross-country, and had placed third in the 1,500 meters in the 
<DATE>1989</DATE> Division I track championships since arriving at <ORGANIZATION>Northridge</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>five years 
ago</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
This cross-country season, however, has been frustrating for Arreola, who will 
compete in the <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> Division I championships at <ORGANIZATION>Pine Lakes Golf Course</ORGANIZATION> in 
<LOCATION>Knoxville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Tenn.</LOCATION>, on <DATE>Monday</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been disappointed," said <PERSON>Arreola</PERSON>, the lone <ORGANIZATION>Northridge</ORGANIZATION> qualifier for the 
national meet. "I think that's why I'm really looking forward to nationals and 
the end of the season. I know that's not the greatest attitude to have going 
into nationals, but I haven't won a race yet. And I haven't improved as much as 
I wanted to." Last season <PERSON>Arreola</PERSON> won four of five cross-country races, 
including the <ORGANIZATION>California Collegiate Athletic Assn.</ORGANIZATION>, Division II West regional 
and Division II titles. 
</P>
<P>
This season she has finished second once, third twice and fourth twice. 
</P>
<P>
After falling behind in her races, <PERSON>Arreola</PERSON> has been forced to battle for second 
-- or worse. It is a notion as foreign to <LOCATION>Arreola</LOCATION> as liberalism is to 
Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
"Before the season began, I thought I had a chance at winning Division I," 
<PERSON>Arreola</PERSON> said. "But after (the) <ORGANIZATION>Stanford</ORGANIZATION> (Invitational), I started to realize 
that that probably won't happen." 
</P>
<P>
Arreola has had her best cross-country season -- lowering her personal best on 
the <ORGANIZATION>Stanford</ORGANIZATION> course by 39 seconds -- but after being a dominant force in 
Division II, she won't be one of the favorites when the women's 5,000-meter 
race begins at <TIME>11 a.m.</TIME> (EST) <DATE>Monday</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to accept that I'm one of the unknowns," the 22-year-old <PERSON>Arreola</PERSON> 
said. "It puts less pressure on me, but it's hard to accept that you're not 
going to be one of the ones they're looking at. 
</P>
<P>
"In the school newspaper the other day, (<ORGANIZATION>Northridge Coach Don</ORGANIZATION>) <PERSON>Strametz</PERSON> said 
that a good goal would be the top 10. I saw that and said, 'Top 10?' But then I 
realized that I'm going to be running against a lot of good girls that I've 
never run against, and that a top-10 finish would probably be a good goal." 
</P>
<P>
Arreola, a fifth-year senior, was a well-beaten third in the <ORGANIZATION>Stanford 
Invitational</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Oct. 6</DATE>, 29 seconds behind winner <PERSON>Suzy Favor</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Wisconsin</LOCATION> and 22 
seconds behind <PERSON>Buffy Rabbitt</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>UC Irvine</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"<PERSON>Suzy</PERSON> was just so far ahead of me," <PERSON>Arreola</PERSON> recalled with a laugh. "And she 
probably won't be the No. 1 favorite on <DATE>Monday</DATE>." 
</P>
<P>
That role will fall to <PERSON>Michelle Dekkers</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>, the <DATE>1988</DATE> 
NCAA Division I champion who defeated Favor for the <ORGANIZATION>Big Ten</ORGANIZATION> and District 4 
titles. 
</P>
<P>
"Dekkers appears to be the favorite," <PERSON>Strametz</PERSON> said, "with (District 8 winner) 
<PERSON>Rabbitt</PERSON> looking for a finish in the top seven. . . . But a lot can happen in 
cross-country." 
</P>
<P>
Strametz linked <PERSON>Arreola</PERSON>'s early-season difficulties to her 70-miles-a-week 
regimen, more than she has ever run before. 
</P>
<P>
"She was training through the meets," <PERSON>Strametz</PERSON> said. "She was racing tired. She 
was not as fresh as some of the people she was running against." 
</P>
<P>
Arreola, the 10th ranked 1,500-meter runner in the country in <DATE>1989</DATE>, concurred 
with <PERSON>Strametz</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
"I kept telling myself, 'Don't worry about it. Just think about regionals and 
nationals, that's all that matters.' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
Based on <PERSON>Arreola</PERSON>'s fourth-place finish in the District 8 meet at <LOCATION>Fresno</LOCATION>'s 
Woodward Park last week, <PERSON>Strametz</PERSON> figures that things are going according to 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
He has tapered <PERSON>Arreola</PERSON>'s training to less than 50 miles a week, and with a 
little fine-tuning, he expects her to be firing on all cylinders <DATE>Monday</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
"She ran her best race of the season at districts," he said. "But she's capable 
of running better. Physically, she was ready to run a great race at districts, 
but mentally she wasn't all there. 
</P>
<P>
"There were certain mental things that she didn't do, like accelerating out of 
the curves. If she runs a great mental race at districts, she runs 15-20 
seconds faster." 
</P>
<P>
The mental aspect of cross-country running is something that Arreola admittedly 
has never mastered. She made marked improvement in that area last season, but 
she has never been as aggressive in cross-country as in track. 
</P>
<P>
"You put her within 10 feet of a track during track season and she becomes an 
animal," <PERSON>Strametz</PERSON> said. "In cross-country, she works hard, but her attitude 
isn't as intense. She is disciplined, but her work ethic has to go to another 
level to reach her potential." 
</P>
<P>
Arreola is aware of her mental shortcomings, but she is hopeful of rectifying 
them by the time she races in <LOCATION>Knoxville</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I've been anywhere close to being mentally there (this season)," 
<PERSON>Arreola</PERSON> said. "I think (<PERSON>Strametz</PERSON>) would like to think that I'm a lot closer 
than I am. I'm really trying to improve in that area, but it's just been hard 
this season. . . . It seems like I keep thinking about track when I should be 
concentrating on cross-country. 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, I can end the season on a good note."

<HL> LEISURE &amp; ARTS -- On Sports: Our Distance Runners Come Up Short </HL>
<AUTHOR> Frederick C. Klein </AUTHOR>
<SO> </SO>
<DATELINE> Indianapolis  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For sports chauvinists, which is to say most of us, the great thing about <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Olympic Trials meets, like the one for track and field in progress here, is that Our Boys and Girls always win. 
We also always take second, third, fourth and all the other places. 
There are no tricky foreign names to unscramble, no East Bloc types to ruin the fun. 

   Trouble is, in many events the fun ends as soon as the rest of the world gets into the act. 
Such has been the case in running events of 800 meters or longer, which is to say most of them. 
The poop-out level of our Olympians seems to arrive about as quickly as does yours or (certainly) mine. 

   In terms of Olympic gold, the principal measure of such accomplishments, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> has been an underdeveloped country in recent years. 
Our men have won but two gold medals in 800-meter-and-over chases since <DATE>1964</DATE>, and our women the same. 
Curiously, two of those four triumphs were in marathons, which at 26 miles and change are the longest of the long. 
Frank Shorter led the panting pack at <LOCATION>Munich</LOCATION> in <DATE>1972</DATE>, and <PERSON>Joan Benoit</PERSON>, who is shorter still, did it in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> in <DATE>1984</DATE>. 

   It would be pleasant to report that this sad state is due for an abrupt change in this quadrennial year, but present evidence supports no such conclusion. 
Our sprinters are burning up the <ORGANIZATION>Indiana University</ORGANIZATION> track here, setting or imperiling world's records every time a car backfires, but our distance persons continue to labor in obscurity. 
Even the sport's bureaucracy gives them short shrift. 

   "It took me two hours to get my pass here <TIME>this morning</TIME>. 
The guy behind the desk wanted to cancel me out because I hadn't phoned ahead," noted <PERSON>Jim Spivey</PERSON> at a <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> meeting with the press. 
"I told him my coach was a lawyer, and that he'd make big trouble if they didn't clear things up. 
That got the guy's attention." 

   Spivey's exasperation was justified, because he has been one of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s two best milers for most of this decade. 
The other is <PERSON>Steve Scott</PERSON>. 
Assuming that all goes well in the preliminary heats that began <TIME>last night</TIME>, the two are favored to represent the Stars and Stripes once again in the metric mile (1,500 meters) at <LOCATION>Seoul</LOCATION>. 

   The business about the pass was doubly off-putting because the bright-eyed, 28-year-old <PERSON>Spivey</PERSON> came to <LOCATION>Indianapolis</LOCATION> full of vinegar, eager to make his mark on the national consciousness. 
One reason for this was his quick heal from a weird injury that had threatened his Olympic dream with a premature wake-up call. 
Another is that he's running under the tutelage of not just one lawyer, but two. 

   The injury was a stress fracture to a "non-weight bearing" bone in his left leg. 
It was discovered last <DATE>spring</DATE> after he complained his back was going "out of kink." 
He says that tests and X-rays not only showed that he had a fracture but also revealed that his left leg was three-eighths of an inch shorter than his right -- the result of the lifetime of left turns that distance-running dictates. 
Rest cured the bone, and a shoe-insert heel lift evened off his pins. 

   The lawyers are <PERSON>Ken Popejoy</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mike Durkin</PERSON>, both national-class milers in their Big Ten salad days in the '70s (<PERSON>Popejoy</PERSON> went to <ORGANIZATION>Michigan State</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Durkin</PERSON> to <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>). 
They now litigate in and around <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>. 
Indiana-grad <PERSON>Spivey</PERSON>, also a Chicago-area native, sought out <PERSON>Durkin</PERSON> for coachly counsel because he was tired of coming up short in his races and recalled <PERSON>Durkin</PERSON> as "someone who might not have had all the ability in the world, but always peaked at the right time." 
Durkin later invited his friend <PERSON>Popejoy</PERSON> to be co-counsel. 
Spivey is their only athletic client. 

   Their arrangement is that <PERSON>Durkin</PERSON> maps <PERSON>Spivey</PERSON>'s training regimen and <PERSON>Popejoy</PERSON> helps carry it out, running stride-for-stride with the miler. 
"I do the workouts, and feel fatigue at the same points <PERSON>Jim</PERSON> does. 
That lets me give feedback to both him and <PERSON>Mike</PERSON>," explains <PERSON>Popejoy</PERSON>. 
"As far as we know, our deal is unique." 

   The plan the three have plotted calls for longer, slower workouts than most <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> milers undertake, and fewer races. 
"It's basically a European approach," <PERSON>Spivey</PERSON> notes. 
It also involves a change in <LOCATION>Spivey</LOCATION>'s former racing strategy. 

   "I tend to wait too long before starting my kick, and <PERSON>Mike</PERSON> has tried to cure me of that," <PERSON>Spivey</PERSON> says. 
"I mean, that's nothing startling, <PERSON>Sam Bell</PERSON>, my coach at <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION>, used to be on me about it all the time. 
But I guess hearing it from a former runner like <PERSON>Mike</PERSON> made more of an impression on me." 

   The collaboration paid off first at the World Championships in <LOCATION>Rome</LOCATION> <DATE>last September</DATE>, when <PERSON>Spivey</PERSON> copped a surprise bronze medal in the 1,500. 
That was the best American showing in an important international mile-or-thereabouts since <PERSON>Jim Ryun</PERSON> placed second in the <DATE>1968</DATE> Olympics. 
This year, even after a layoff for the leg injury, <PERSON>Spivey</PERSON> ran a 3:50 mile (albeit in a sixth-place finish) against a crack field in <LOCATION>Oslo</LOCATION>. 
He also got off a personal-best two mile and his second-fastest 800. 

   "I'm 28, about the age where I ought to be running my best, and I am," <PERSON>Spivey</PERSON> says. 
"I won a couple of <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> championships when I was younger, and that set me up for the kind of financial support that enabled me to get this far, which makes me lucky. 
I think the main trouble with American milers, and our distance runners in general, is that that kind of support is so hard to come by." 

   Spivey believes that running-shoe companies, the primary support of many <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> track athletes (his angel is <ORGANIZATION>Nike</ORGANIZATION>), lack the patience to nurture slow-developing distance runners. 
The same goes for official <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> track sources. 

   "I'm a proven commodity and a veteran of the <DATE>1984</DATE> Olympics {where he placed fifth in the 1,500}, so I get <MONEY>$1,500</MONEY> every month from the Olympic committee's 'Operation <LOCATION>Seoul</LOCATION>.' 
That's fine, but I really think the money might be better spent if they gave me, maybe, <MONEY>$400</MONEY>, and split the rest among five or six other people. 
For a young fellow, with few expenses, even <MONEY>$100</MONEY> or <MONEY>$125</MONEY> a month is a lot of money. 
It might keep him in the sport. 
And then we might not have to ask ourselves why we don't win medals in the distances."

<HEADLINE>  IT'S JUST NOT THE SAME THING
SUCCESS ON TRACK OFTEN DOESN'T EXTEND TO
CROSS-COUNTRY  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  High School Report  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Yet it's not her favorite sport. She prefers track and field.;   And, no,
it's not the same thing.;   "I work better when people are in the stands
watching," said <PERSON>Sweeney</PERSON>, a senior at <ORGANIZATION>Leigh High</ORGANIZATION>. "It gets the adrenaline
running. I'm getting used to running the hills (in cross-country), but I don't
like running them that much.";   Her preference for track typifies the
challenge runners and coaches confront -- making track athletes better
cross-country runners and vice versa.;   The solution isn't simple because the
sports differ in specific ways. Although both sports involve some distance
running, the training and running conditions are different, as well as the
seasons in which they are held. These factors present a test for runners to
excel in both sports.;   <PERSON>Sweeney</PERSON>, who has qualified for the state track meet
the past two springs, has succeeded in both sports, but for many athletes
that's not easy.;   And her preference for one over the other is "typical, and
it's a concern," said <PERSON>Rudy Montenegro</PERSON>, who coaches cross-country and track at
<LOCATION>Gunderson</LOCATION>. "The reasons (for runners excelling in just one) vary.";   The key
differences; Among the issues that make cross-country and track separate
disciplines:;   (check) Hills vs. flat surfaces. The rugged terrain can allow
a strong cross-country runner to compensate for a lack of exceptional speed.
The flat track provides an advantage for lighter, quicker runners.;   (check)
Scenery vs. monotony. Some runners prefer the rolling hills and unknowns of
cross-country courses, which clears their minds during a race. "We have a
saying, 'Hills are our friends,' " <PERSON>Moreau</PERSON> Coach <PERSON>Phil Wilder</PERSON> said.;   <PERSON>Gunn</PERSON>
Coach <PERSON>Hal Daner</PERSON> added: "Some hate to count laps around the track.";   (check)
Fans vs. no fans. Runners such as <PERSON>Sweeney</PERSON> prefer track because they can gauge
their distance by counting the laps and listen to support from the crowd
around the track.;   "I know in <DATE>1987</DATE> <PERSON>Scott Robinson</PERSON> liked running in front of
a big crowd," <ORGANIZATION>Bellarmine Coach Terry Ward</ORGANIZATION> said.;   Spurred to victory;
<PERSON>Robinson</PERSON>, running in front of about 10,000 vocal fans at <LOCATION>Sacramento</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Hughes
Stadium</ORGANIZATION>, put on a tremendous kick during final 300 meters to win the boys'
1,600 meters at the state track meet.;   "His father still has the tape with
the sounds of the crowd," Ward said.;   (check) Conditioning methods. Track
athletes usually start practicing in the <DATE>winter</DATE>, when school is in session and
coaches are available to supervise. A good cross-country runner works out
during the <DATE>summer</DATE>, often without supervision.;   "I stress the <DATE>summer</DATE> program
a lot," <PERSON>Leigh Coach Bill Hotchkiss</PERSON> said. "<PERSON>Kate</PERSON> (<PERSON>Sweeney</PERSON>) ran only 20 to 30
miles a week (during the <DATE>summer</DATE> of <DATE>1990</DATE>), and she took her lumps early. This
<DATE>summer</DATE> she was much better. It has to come from within.";   Some coaches don't
believe <DATE>summer</DATE> cross-country training should be limited to running.;   "You
need a base of mileage, swimming and biking," <PERSON>Wilder</PERSON> said. "You need a lot of
drills because there are different courses.";   Cross-country races are
usually about a mile longer than the longest track event -- the two-mile or
3,200 meters, so endurance plays a bigger role in cross-country.;   Commuter
athletes; Because cross-country meets are held on different courses, some
schools, especially those located far from mountain trails, commute
considerable distances just to practice under meet-like conditions -- another
difference from running around an oval track.;   <PERSON>Ward</PERSON> said <PERSON>Bellarmine</PERSON> has
worked out at <LOCATION>Los Gatos</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Rancho San Antonio Park</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Alum Rock Park</LOCATION> and the hills
near the Stanford satellite dish between Highway 280 and <ORGANIZATION>Foothill Expressway.</ORGANIZATION>;
  <PERSON>Gunn</PERSON>'s <PERSON>Daner</PERSON> said he works his runners in the mountains in an effort to
prepare them for similar conditions at <ORGANIZATION>Crystal Springs</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Belmont</LOCATION>, site of the
<ORGANIZATION>Central Coast Section</ORGANIZATION> championships.;   Watching a runner's success in one
sport carry over to the next sport would be a dream of cross-country and track
coaches.;   "I was a perfect example," said <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION>, who attended Lincoln
High. "I couldn't stay with the track people because I had no leg speed. In
cross-country, I worked hard and had the talent for distance races. I built up
my strength and speed and became a pretty good two-miler.";   Strong case for
strength work; <ORGANIZATION>Santa Teresa Coach Frank Bautista</ORGANIZATION> warned that track coaches
shouldn't overlook the benefits of strength-oriented workouts when coaching
distance runners.;   <PERSON>Hotchkiss</PERSON> believes <PERSON>Sweeney</PERSON>, with a bigger commitment to
cross-country, could reap benefits this season in both sports.;  
"(Recruiting) letters are cheap," <PERSON>Hotchkiss</PERSON> said. "When it's scholarship time,
you have to produce."  </TEXT>

<HL> Medicine &amp; Health (A Special Report): Getting Older
---
Take 2 Laps, Call Me in the Morning:
Middle-Aged Folks Need to Tailor
Exercise Regimens to Their Goals
---
By Mike Tharp</HL>
<DD> 04/24/87</DD>
<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO>
<TEXT>
   COUCH POTATO is out. 
Fit is in. 

   Just ask <PERSON>William Bell</PERSON>, a 64-year-old <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> manufacturing executive who has run 123 marathons and completed nine triathlons and still needs a challenge. 
Lately, <PERSON>Mr. Bell</PERSON> has taken to wilderness expeditions, the kind that have you climbing icy slopes in the Canadian Rockies. 

   "I don't even ski, and I don't like to get cold," he says of a recent trip. 
"But it's one of the most exciting things I've ever done physically." 

   There are less demanding ways to feel better through exercise, and Americans of all ages are finding them. 
Getting in shape, in fact, has become the new religion of a graying population: "We really need to learn how to live the second half of our lives," says <PERSON>Robert Prichard</PERSON>, president of Somax, a posture and sports clinic in <LOCATION>San Rafael</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif</LOCATION>. 

   Even over-the-hill athletes have come to realize that age needn't be the barrier to performance it once was thought. 
The successes of 39-year-old <PERSON>Bill Rodgers</PERSON> in running, 40-year-old <PERSON>Kareem Abdul-Jabbar</PERSON> in professional basketball, 46-year-old <PERSON>Jack Nicklaus</PERSON> in golf and 50-year-old <PERSON>Wilt Chamberlain</PERSON> in a new volleyball career have inspired many people who no longer count birthday candles. 

   Specific regimens and exercise routines vary widely, from walking to mountain climbing. 
But fitness experts agree on these basic steps for toning and shaping flaccid muscles, puny lungs or hardening arteries: 

   --If you're out of shape and want to change that, first consult a physician. 
Then begin slowly. 
A 30-minute workout three times a week for walking, jogging, swimming or aerobics is a good start. 

   --Warm up, and cool down. 
Spend 10 minutes or so before and after any vigorous exercise stretching the torso and moving arms and legs. 
Stretching afterward is particularly important because it moves fresh blood into still-warm muscles to nourish them. 

   --Misery loves company. 
A workout partner helps motivate you, relieves the boredom of repetitive exercises and can spot incorrect exercise moves. 

   --Work on your abdominal muscles. 
One way to prevent back trouble is to have a strong stomach. 
If there's a pool available, get in, back up to the edge, hang on with both arms, and repeatedly lift your legs or knees up through the water while keeping your back against the pool edge. 

   Another method is to lie on the floor with your feet propped up on a bed; then, keeping your lower back on the floor, lift your head and shoulders two or three inches. 
Repeat. 
Avoid traditional situps; they can aggravate back problems. 

   --Expect a little pain. 
The normal buildup of lactic acid in the muscles causes a burning sensation during a workout. 
But stop if you become dizzy or feel a sharp or unusual pain. 
Don't exercise with a cramped muscle. 
Try to stretch it out. 

   --Know the equipment. 
Common sense plays a big role here. 
Don't use, say, ankle weights to jog (they put pressure on the foot). 
And before tackling the Nautilus or the universal gym, ask an instructor for a briefing on the best technique. 

   It doesn't take much to embroider those basics. 
<PERSON>John Carr</PERSON>, 48-year-old vice president of a <ORGANIZATION>Southern California</ORGANIZATION> financial-services company, considers himself a recreational runner, putting in 15 to 20 miles a week. 
But nearly every week, he's out on the field with members of the <ORGANIZATION>Los Angeles Track Club</ORGANIZATION>, which has 21 world-class athletes in its stable. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Carr</PERSON> is one of a half-dozen or so participants in an adult training program run by the club's coach, <PERSON>Chuck Debus</PERSON>. 
For <MONEY>$30</MONEY> a session, <PERSON>Mr. Debus</PERSON> takes his older charges through two hours of stretching, calisthenics and running, exercising muscles through their entire range of motion. 

   "I try to take all my athletes" -- young and old -- "back to the holistic activities they did as children," <PERSON>Mr. Debus</PERSON> says. 
<PERSON>Mr. Carr</PERSON> says that since starting the regimen <DATE>six months ago</DATE>, he has lost weight, sleeps better and has more energy throughout the day. 

   Among the 40-plus generation, conventional exercises remain popular, though some have been adapted for the age group. 
"Low-impact" aerobics, for example, have replaced ordinary aerobics for those not quite ready for an hour of disco fever or break dancing. 
The pace is about the same, but the movements are more like marching than jumping. 
You also use your upper body more than your lower body, and you don't bounce on your feet. 

   <PERSON>Zoanne Smith</PERSON>, an instructor who taught aerobics for three years on a <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> cruise ship, recommends the low-impact variety to avoid stress fractures, shin splints, tendonitis and other ailments. 

   "You can still get your heart rate up by using your upper body," she says. 
She also recommends personalized classes, in which instructors pay attention to the needs of individual members. 

   As in other walks and runs of life, technology has charged into the athletic arena. 
Dozens of specialized shoe models and brands are available for any sport, with prices sometimes over <MONEY>$100</MONEY>. 
There also are special socks for aerobics, tennis, wrestling and running; the differences are in the tightness of the weave or the location of extra padding. 
Men now don support hose almost as un-self-consciously as women. 

   For home use, amateur athletes can choose among exercise bicycles, rowing machines, treadmills and multipurpose gymnasiums. 
The benefit of all this gear is that it strengthens muscles by providing points of resistance. 
What's questionable is whether it's necessary to spend <MONEY>$1,000</MONEY> or so to accomplish that. 

   Walking is cheaper, and it's enjoying a renaissance led by people in their 50s and 60s. 
In a club founded 18 months ago by <ORGANIZATION>Meridian Park Hospital</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Portland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ore.</LOCATION>, for instance, nearly half of the 850 members are over 65. 
They stroll several times a week through a half-mile course in a local shopping mall. 

   "It has increased their awareness of their personal responsibility for health and wellness," <PERSON>Pat Partlow</PERSON>, a hospital official, says. 

   To be beneficial to the heart and lungs, walking should be done three to five times a week for 30 to 45 minutes at a time. 
Another benefit: A 150-pound person can burn off 240 calories walking two miles in an hour. 

   Swimming, considered one of the best overall forms of exercise, is also popular because there isn't much risk of getting hurt while doing it. 
"It's good for cardiovascular health without shocking your system," says <PERSON>D.R. Mackenroth</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Silicon Valley</LOCATION> technical writer in his 40s who swims 1,500 meters twice a week. 
"But unless you've got <PERSON>Brooke Shields</PERSON> in the next lane, it can get pretty boring." 

   Which brings us to the Wet Vest. 
Billed by its designer, <PERSON>Glenn McWaters</PERSON>, as a tool for both therapy and fitness, the product resembles a lightweight life jacket. 
It buoys the wearer in water while he or she runs or performs aerobics. 
<PERSON>Mr. McWaters</PERSON> estimates water's resistance at 44 times that of air when sprinting in a pool and 12 times that of air when running slowly. 
The extra resistance, he says, means a more intense muscular workout; the aquatic buoyancy prevents damage to the body. 

   However, as with any workout scheme, drawbacks exist. 
<PERSON>Michael Ford</PERSON>, a finance company executive, used and liked the Wet Vest while recovering from a back injury. 
But he doesn't wear it now. 

   "You don't sweat," he explains. 
"Part of running or playing basketball or any workout is getting a good sweat up -- plus that lets you justify pounding a few beers afterward."

FIVE UCLA SWIMMERS AMONG THE FAVORITES IN PAC-10 MEET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION> men's swim team (9-4 in dual meets and 3-2 against <ORGANIZATION>Pacific 10 
Conference</ORGANIZATION> opponents) will vie with powers <ORGANIZATION>Stanford</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION> in the 
Pac-10 championships <DATE>today through Saturday</DATE> at the Belmont Plaza Pool in <LOCATION>Long 
Beach</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
In earlier dual meets, the Bruins defeated the Cardinal and <LOCATION>Cal</LOCATION> but lost to the 
Trojans, 69-44. 
</P>
<P>
Five <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION> swimmers are among the favorites in their events. Bruin All-American 
sophomores <PERSON>Brian Kurza</PERSON> and <PERSON>Andrea Cecchi</PERSON> will defend their championships in the 
50-yard freestyle and 100 breast-stroke, respectively. Cecchi also is one of 
the top entrants in the 200 breast-stroke. 
</P>

UCLA All-American senior <PERSON>Mark Dean</PERSON> will be hard to beat in the 200 butterfly. 
Dean has a 14-1 record in that event in dual meets during the last two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Bruin freshman <PERSON>Geoff Cronin</PERSON>, who won the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Swimming Long Course</ORGANIZATION> 100-meter 
backstroke last <DATE>summer</DATE>, could beat the pack in the 100-yard and 200 backstroke 
events. UCLA All-American senior <PERSON>Rodrigo Gonzalez</PERSON>, a <DATE>1988</DATE> Olympian for <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>, 
is rated highly in the 200 individual medley. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA should earn points in the 400 freestyle relay and the 400 medley relay.

RUNNING: WITH OLYMPICS IN SIGHT, HER DEDICATION SHIFTS INTO HIGH GEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Barbie Ludovise 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Unlike many world-class athletes, <PERSON>Joan Hansen</PERSON> has never felt the need to commit 
seemingly endless years of her life in pursuit of glory. 
</P>
<P>
Train rigorously for years without a break? 
</P>
<P>
No way. 
</P>
<P>
Get psyched for races years in advance? 
</P>
<P>
Not hardly. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, <PERSON>Hansen</PERSON>, 31, and a <DATE>1984</DATE> Olympian, seems to reach her athletic potential 
in spurts. Intentionally. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have that kind of personality where I say, 'Oh my God, I've got to get 
out and train!' " <PERSON>Hansen</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't ever describe myself as a fanatic. I can focus well on anything I 
do . . . but I do not want that focus to become overly unhealthy or overly 
obsessive. I like to tread that fine line between obsession and hobby." 
</P>
<P>
And right now, running is once again becoming less of a hobby. 
</P>
<P>
After nearly a year off from training -- and several years removed from her 
best performances -- <PERSON>Hansen</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Los Alamitos</LOCATION> resident, started again last 
<DATE>October</DATE>. She has dedicated herself to regaining the world-class form that 
helped her set an indoor world record in the two-mile in <DATE>1982</DATE>, and make the 
Olympic team in <DATE>'84</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes something pretty big to keep her motivated, but if it's the Olympics, 
<PERSON>Joan</PERSON> gets pretty excited about that," said <PERSON>Robert Vaughn</PERSON>, coach of a 
Dallas-based club who has worked on and off with <PERSON>Hansen</PERSON> for the past six years. 
</P>
<P>
"It will not be easy. But if you're talented, things can happen," he said. 
"<PERSON>Joan</PERSON>'s very, very talented." 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately for <PERSON>Hansen</PERSON>, she didn't get to prove her talent when she most 
wanted, in the <DATE>1984</DATE> Games. 
</P>
<P>
Running in the women's 3,000-meters -- the race most remember only for the <PERSON>Mary 
Decker-Zola Budd</PERSON> tangle -- <PERSON>Hansen</PERSON> also suffered a fall just less than half-way 
through the race when she tripped on the heels of <LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Aurora Cunha</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike <PERSON>Decker</PERSON>, <PERSON>Hansen</PERSON> got up and continued running. Although she was in last 
place when she got up, <PERSON>Hansen</PERSON> passed four runners and finished eighth in the 
field of 12. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw (<ORGANIZATION>Decker</ORGANIZATION>) go down and lay on the ground, but my main concern was to keep 
going," <PERSON>Hansen</PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION>Times</ORGANIZATION> staff writer <PERSON>Curt Holbreich</PERSON> last year. "I knew she 
was down. I hoped she would get back up. I cared about what happened. I could 
relate. But I also knew in the middle of a race, there was no way I could stop 
and help her." 
</P>
<P>
A proficient swimmer while growing up in <LOCATION>Phoenix</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Hansen</PERSON> didn't start running 
until her sophomore year at <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>. Her identical twin, <PERSON>Joy Hansen</PERSON>, also grew 
up a swimmer, but joined the Wildcat cross-country team as a freshman and 
qualified for <ORGANIZATION>AIAW</ORGANIZATION> nationals in her first race. Joan decided to join her 
sister, and, the next year, walked on to the track and field team. 
</P>
<P>
"We realized training for one hour on a track every day was better than five 
hours in a pool," <PERSON>Joan</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
The <PERSON>Hansen</PERSON> twins, petite, blonde and blue-eyed, became a quick and well-known 
success. Joan, a six-time <ORGANIZATION>AIAW</ORGANIZATION> All-American at <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>, and Joy, now a 
world-class triathlete, appeared on the cover of Runner's World magazine. The 
cover photo featured the two sitting on opposite shoulders of <PERSON>Steve Scott</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
Joan, the faster twin, qualified for <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> national teams for five years between 
<DATE>1981</DATE> and <DATE>'85</DATE>. In that time she traveled around the world for competition. Of 
the travel, <PERSON>Hansen</PERSON> said she will always be grateful as it gave her an 
appreciation of other countries and other life styles. 
</P>
<P>
On a <DATE>1982</DATE> trip to <LOCATION>Bucharest</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION>, for the <ORGANIZATION>World University Games</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Hansen</PERSON> 
remembers going outside of the area reserved for the athletes to find hundreds 
of people picketing the event. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked what the signs said. I was told the people wanted the games stopped. 
The people were demanding food," <PERSON>Hansen</PERSON> said. "Inside (the athletic area), we 
the athletes were entitled to as much food as we could eat. Outside people were 
starving." 
</P>
<P>
On another trip, <PERSON>Hansen</PERSON> said she remembers a group of Lebanese athletes playing 
guitar and singing happily while many of the American athletes complained about 
the unfamiliar conditions. 
</P>
<P>
"We asked why they were so happy and they said for once they could go outside 
and train without fear of being hurt or killed," <PERSON>Hansen</PERSON> said. "In <LOCATION>Lebanon</LOCATION>, they 
had to train inside their homes because the fighting had gotten too violent 
outside." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Hansen</PERSON> said it was experiences such as these that helped shape her outlook on 
sports and life. Last year, while living in <LOCATION>Coronado</LOCATION>, she helped start the <LOCATION>San 
Diego</LOCATION> Athletes Fund, a nonprofit organization designed to raise money for <LOCATION>San 
Diego</LOCATION> athletes training for the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Hansen</PERSON> also has been active in volunteering her time to children, giving 
classroom presentations aimed at encouraging development of self-worth and 
self-improvement. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was young, Olympians seemed special to me," she said. "Now that I'm 
older, I realize that the negative press that some Olympians are attracting 
isn't (good for the sport). . . . I want to show that Olympians can have a 
positive influence, too." 
</P>
<P>
The Long Run: After finishing second the <DATE>past two years</DATE>, <PERSON>Mike McMahan</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Laguna 
Beach</LOCATION> won his first Orange 24-hour Run <DATE>last weekend</DATE> at <ORGANIZATION>Fred Kelly Stadium in 
Orange</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
For the past two years, McMahan, a philosophy professor at <ORGANIZATION>Saddleback College</ORGANIZATION> 
and UC <LOCATION>Irvine</LOCATION>, had taken the immediate lead in the race, one that always starts 
at <TIME>6 p.m.</TIME> on a <DATE>Friday</DATE> and runs non-stop until <TIME>6 p.m.</TIME> <DATE>Saturday</DATE>. But in <DATE>1987</DATE> and 
<DATE>1988</DATE>, McMahan faded badly around the 100-mile mark, and was passed both years 
by eventual winner <PERSON>Leo Marquez</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Bakersfield</LOCATION>. Marquez set the event record 
last year with 137 1/2 miles. 
</P>
<P>
But this year, <PERSON>McMahan</PERSON>, 41, maintained his lead through the entire 24 hours, 
finishing with 132 1/4 miles, or 51/4 miles further than his previous best. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Tom Terry</PERSON>, 44, of <LOCATION>Culver City</LOCATION> was second with 128 1/4 miles, and <PERSON>Marquez</PERSON>, 50, 
was third with 115. And <PERSON>Erma Hutton</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Pasadena</LOCATION> (fourth overall with 108 3/4) 
and <PERSON>Meg Slavin</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Irvine</LOCATION> (sixth with 104) became the first women in seven years 
to break the 100-mile mark at the Orange race. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-six runners started the 100-mile run, though, according to race director 
<PERSON>Don Pycior</PERSON>, "Some hit 50 miles and said, 'OK . . . that's it.' " 
</P>
<P>
Other highlights? "Well, one guy went 40 miles juggling three tennis balls," 
<PERSON>Pycior</PERSON> said. "But he was just one of those kind of guys who sign up at the last 
second." 
</P>
<P>
Forty miles of juggling? An impulse decision? 
</P>
<P>
Running Notes 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Rick Rengel</PERSON>, next year's race chairman for the <ORGANIZATION>Bastille Day 8K</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Newport 
Beach</LOCATION>, said race organizers have decided to put together a <MONEY>$100,000</MONEY> bonus 
package next year for any Bastille Day entrant who breaks the 8K world record. 
The race, proceeds of which benefit the <ORGANIZATION>United Cerebral Palsy</ORGANIZATION>, is hoping to 
attract a large field of world-class runners. Interested sponsors are welcomed 
to contact Rengel at any time. . . . Loeschhorn's Masters Men, a group of 
30-and-over runners, broke the men's masters relay record at the Orange 24-hour 
Run. The team of 10 compiled 221 1/4 miles, a big improvement over the former 
mark of 208 miles.

SOUZA WINS BIATHLON TO KEEP STREAK GOING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
<PERSON>Ken Souza</PERSON>, never one to peer over his shoulder during a race, continued his 
unbeaten streak <DATE>Sunday</DATE> at the <ORGANIZATION>Coors Light Biathlon Series</ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION>Brea 
Marketplace</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Souza, who splits his training between <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Boulder</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Colo.</LOCATION>, held off 
late charges by <PERSON>Brent Steiner</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Tempe</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ariz.</LOCATION>, and <PERSON>Joel Thompson</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Encinitas</LOCATION>, 
to win his 16th consecutive race on the Coors series since it began last year. 
Liz Downing, of <LOCATION>Portland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ore.</LOCATION>, won the women's competition. 
</P>
<P>
Souza finished the three-segment race -- a five-kilometer (3.1-mile) run, a 
30-kilometer (18.6-mile) bike ride and another five-kilometer run -- in a 
course-record 1 hour 10 minutes 18 seconds. The record for the Brea course was 
1:16:54 set last year by <PERSON>Mike Smith</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
Souza, 24, led the entire race and had a 70-second lead after the bike ride. 
</P>
<P>
Steiner finished second in 1:11:15 and <PERSON>Thompson</PERSON> third at 1:12:09. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the closest so far this year," <PERSON>Souza</PERSON> said. "I knew I had a good lead. I 
just wanted to maintain it. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a course where you're able to ride fast on. There are more turns and 
areas where riders who aren't as strong can do well." 
</P>
<P>
Souza said he wasn't aware he was on a record pace. In fact, he rarely keeps 
track of times. 
</P>
<P>
"Each course varies," he said. "Some are longer and some are shorter in 
different areas. It's not a sport where you can judge your times, like track 
and field, where you have set distances like the 400 (meters) and the mile." 
</P>
<P>
Souza entered the race with a 40-point lead over <PERSON>Thompson</PERSON> in the season 
standings. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a bonus pool at the end of the year for the series champion," <PERSON>Souza</PERSON> 
said. "This is what I do for a living, just like a pro golfer or tennis player. 
This is my circuit and I travel around and do the best I can." 
</P>
<P>
Downing made sure there were no surprises in the women's race. 
</P>
<P>
She held off early challenges from <PERSON>Kristi Kidwell</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Anaheim</LOCATION> and defending 
champion <ORGANIZATION>Sue Griesbach of Fullerton</ORGANIZATION> to win in 1:19:27. Downing, who leads the 
women's point standings, broke <PERSON>Griesbach</PERSON>'s course record by 6:25. 
</P>
<P>
'I'm pretty happy with my time," said Downing, who has won six of the seven 
races she's entered this year. "But you never know, the course could have been 
short. It's definitely the most technical course I've been on." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Kidwell</PERSON>, who finished second in 1:22:27, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
She encountered some unexpected obstacles on the cycling course -- runners. The 
races were started in several different flights, with runners and cyclists 
meeting at certain points on the course. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, <PERSON>Kidwell</PERSON> found herself weaving on her bike like a Grand Prix racer. 
</P>
<P>
"The runners are supposed to stick to the right side," she said. "But when 
people got tired, they were spread all over the road. There were a couple near 
misses." 
</P>
<P>
Souza said he noticed some slick spots on the cycling course. Sprinklers had 
been left on during the race. 
</P>
<P>
"There were a few spots," he said. "But it wasn't bad." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Frank Shorter</PERSON>, winner of the <DATE>1972</DATE> Olympic marathon, finished seventh in 
1:17:08.

activities help prevent muscle soreness.  </CAPTION>
<DESCRIPT>  HEALTH; FITNESS  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  PERHAPS you were persuaded by friends to take a long bike ride or hike over
hill and dale, and though you're in good shape, your leg muscles were so sore
the next day that you could hardly walk the stairs.;   Or maybe you took a
long swim and a painful cramp in one foot suddenly stopped you in mid-stroke.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Living  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  CAUSES OF MUSCLE PROBLEMS ARE POORLY UNDERSTOOD
STRAINING TO UNDERSTAND PAINFUL MUSCLE CRAMPS  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Health &amp; Fitness  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Muscle soreness and cramps can afflict almost anyone. You don't even have
to be doing something athletic.;   Muscles can get sore from helping someone
move, digging up the garden or polishing the car. You can be awakened from a
deep sleep by an excruciating cramp in your calf. Or you can develop a stitch
in your side while hurrying to catch a bus.;   Theories abound as to why
muscles develop aches, pains or cramps. And the playing fields, locker rooms
and marketplace are rife with highly touted preventives and remedies,
including sports drinks, bananas, stretching, liniment, ice packs and heating
pads. But only a few have stood the test of scientific research.;   For
example, when <PERSON>Michael Chang</PERSON>, then 17, upset <PERSON>Ivan Lendl</PERSON> at the French Open two
years ago, he was plagued by painful cramps in his thighs throughout much of
the match. To alleviate the agony, he drank water, stretched and massaged his
legs and ate bananas, a rich source of potassium, during each changeover.;  
The water and massage no doubt helped, and the stretching may have, too. But
the bananas could not have been digested and absorbed fast enough to provide
his muscles with the potassium <PERSON>Chang</PERSON> thought they needed.;   Despite all the
attention paid to athletic performance and exercise physiology, the causes of
muscle problems are poorly understood. But there is no question that muscles
can get sore whenever they are called upon to do something out of the
ordinary.;   For example, someone who regularly jogs or swims laps can be very
sore after an occasional bike ride, softball game or tennis match. You can
also become sore from doing much more than is customary of a usual activity.; 
 For example, someone used to jogging three miles a day may become sore after
running a 10K (6.2 mile) race, or people training for a marathon may become
sore if they increase their distance or speed too rapidly.;   The soreness
probably stems from microscopic tears in the muscle fibers, resulting in
swelling, stiffness and pain.;   A muscle cramp, or spasm, is a very painful,
sustained, involuntary contraction of a muscle. It can occur, for example, in
the calf of a runner or tennis player, the thigh of a cyclist or the foot or
calf of a swimmer.;   While most injuries are more common in people who exert
themselves when they are out of shape, muscle cramps are more likely in people
with well-developed muscles.;   A cramp begins when a muscle contracts while
already in its most shortened position. For example, when a swimmer is doing
the flutter kick with toes pointed (the proper technique), the calf muscles
are shortened.;   Other, less-frequent causes of cramps include low blood
sugar, dehydration, an imbalance of electrolytes (body salts such as sodium,
potassium and chloride) caused by excessive sweating or the use of diuretics,
inadequate conditioning or over-exertion.;   Muscle cramps can also result
when strenuous work is performed in a very hot environment. Heat cramps may
occur during the activity or as long as 18 hours later. They are most probably
caused by an extreme loss of water and salt through excessive sweating.;   The
only sure way to prevent muscle soreness is to avoid too much of any activity
to which you are not accustomed. Instead, work up slowly to the maximum
desired level. Studies of stretching exercises before and after the activity
suggest that a five-minute stretch may help, but lengthy stretching does not.;
  Taking 400 milligrams of ibuprofen, the over-the-counter anti-inflammatory
drug, a few hours before the activity and twice more at eight-hour intervals
afterward can significantly decrease muscle soreness, a recent study at <ORGANIZATION>Texas
Women's University</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION> concluded. Once muscles get sore, it may be
three days to three weeks before they feel normal again.;   As for muscle
cramps, there are no guarantees. Be sure to drink plenty of water before and
during any strenuous activity. The value of sports drinks that are high in
electrolytes is in dispute, but their sugar and salts may help some people who
sweat excessively or who engage in hours-long vigorous activity.;   Sports
nutrition specialists suggest mixing such drinks in equal parts with water to
dilute sugar; too high a concentration can delay water absorption. Including
potassium-rich foods, such as bananas, oranges and cantaloupes, in the diet
can help.  </TEXT>

They're not exactly the most ruthless competitors or greatest showmen -- you 
won't see anyone yelling at linesmen like <PERSON>John McEnroe</PERSON>, or <PERSON>Andre Agassi</PERSON> types 
throwing their denim shorts into a crowd of screaming fans. You probably won't 
see many Steffi Graf forehands or Gabriela Sabatini topspin backhands either. 
</P>
<P>
What you will see at the <ORGANIZATION>La Jolla Beach and Tennis Club</ORGANIZATION> this week at the annual 
senior tennis tournament is camaraderie, skill, finesse, style and athleticism. 
</P>
<P>
The skills might have eroded just a tad and the stamina might not be there for 
the grueling five-setter anymore, but the will is still there. 
</P>
<P>
"We all want to win," said 67-year-old <PERSON>Lyle Lee</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Palm Springs</LOCATION>. "And I'm in 
great shape for the shape I'm in." 
</P>
<P>
Lee came to La Jolla with his wife, daughter and 3-year old granddaughter. 
</P>
<P>
"My kids don't get too excited about it," <PERSON>Lee</PERSON> said. "My daughter thinks I'm 
going through a mid-life crisis, too late." 
</P>
<P>
A former college and semi-pro baseball player, Lee began playing tennis at 53. 
</P>
<P>
"I started watching <PERSON>Billie Jean King</PERSON> and <PERSON>Bobby Riggs</PERSON>, and that got me really 
interested," <PERSON>Lee</PERSON> said. "I really admired <PERSON>Bobby Riggs</PERSON> for getting out there." 
</P>
<P>
Lee has never been afforded the opportunity to play <PERSON>Riggs</PERSON> on the tour, but he 
has played <PERSON>Tom Brown</PERSON>, who was once ranked No. 1 in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>. Lee lost 
in straight sets but did win a courtesy game. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just a thrill being on the same court with the man," he said. 
</P>
<P>
For <PERSON>Lee</PERSON> and most seniors, the tour is a family affair. They stay at each others 
homes, travel together and play together. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of our best friends are on the tour," <PERSON>Lee</PERSON> said. "We get very close." 
</P>
<P>
But for brief interludes, friendships must be forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
"I was traveling to a tournament with my doubles partner and best friend, and 
then all of a sudden we find out we're playing each other in the first round." 
</P>
<P>
Although she lost a second-round match in straight sets in the 60s singles 
here, <PERSON>Lovie Beard</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION> said she was fulfilled. 
</P>
<P>
"I can play people everyday at home, but I can't play these Californians all 
the time," Beard said. "I want to improve my game, and I need to play these 
top-ranked players to do so." 
</P>
<P>
Like many of the seniors, <ORGANIZATION>Beard</ORGANIZATION> took up tennis later in life. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was a great way of staying in shape," said <ORGANIZATION>Beard</ORGANIZATION>, who also runs 
three miles a day and works part-time as a nurse. 
</P>
<P>
"My biggest advantage out there is my physical ability." 
</P>
<P>
At 66, <ORGANIZATION>Beard</ORGANIZATION> said she's still attempting to pass some of the old pros who 
played junior tennis. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of (the late bloomers) know they're not going to win," she said. "I don't 
think you can catch up. They may have lost a bit in some areas, but they've 
still got the touch. In the five-minute warmup, they pick all your faults out 
before the match has even started." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Vilma Gordon</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Santa Barbara</LOCATION> did not play junior tennis either, but somehow 
her game has caught up. Self-taught, <PERSON>Gordon</PERSON> began playing 25 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I came out here to see how far I could go," said <PERSON>Gordon</PERSON>, seeded second in <DATE>this 
week</DATE>'s <ORGANIZATION>National Hardcourt Championships</ORGANIZATION> in the 60s singles (she advanced to the 
quarterfinals <DATE>Thursday</DATE> with a 6-1, 6-1 victory over <PERSON>Catherine Duke</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Encino</LOCATION>). 
</P>
<P>
In the <DATE>past 20 years</DATE>, <PERSON>Gordon</PERSON> has won a handful of national hardcourt titles and 
has been ranked among the top 10 nationally in singles and doubles. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon says the key to her success has been her athleticism. Gordon is a former 
"fronton tennis player" -- a version of racquetball -- and basketball player. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of women don't like to hit an overhead, but I do," she said. "A lot of 
women don't like to serve and volley, but I do. I'm a good athlete, and that 
gets me by. Most of the players like to stay back and play on the baseline and 
expend less energy. What they don't realize is it takes more energy to play 
long baseline points than it does to come to the net and get the point over 
with." 
</P>
<P>
How long will Gordon continue to charge the net? 
</P>
<P>
"Until I drop dead, because I love it."

<MEMO>  How I Stay Fit  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     WEIGHT: 115 pounds;    PERSONAL: Single and lives in <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION>;   
OCCUPATION: Commercial real estate agent, <ORGANIZATION>J.R. Parrish Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION>;   
FITNESS BACKGROUND: Because of <ORGANIZATION>Rotwein</ORGANIZATION>'s "adventurous and curious" nature, she
has tried para-sailing, mountain climbing, surfing and scuba diving. She gave
up parachuting right away after landing in a field of brussels sprouts.;   
Except for the time she spent in <LOCATION>Aspen</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Colo.</LOCATION>, after high school -- she went
there for the <DATE>summer</DATE> and ended up staying for nine months "partying, living on
pennies and eating oatmeal three times a day," she has been fit and physically
active all her life.;    After getting burned out in <LOCATION>Aspen</LOCATION> and feeling a need
to get grounded, she moved to <LOCATION>Santa Cruz</LOCATION> to attend school. For the <DATE>past 15
years</DATE>, her pursuit of a mix of enjoyable activities has kept her consistently
committed to feeling good through exercise.;    REGIMEN: "I'm one of the
'morning maniacs' who gets up at <TIME>4:30 a.m.</TIME> <DATE>Monday</DATE> through <DATE>Friday</DATE> to be at the
gym no later than 5:15." Her stationary bike rides end when she's finished
reading the newspaper. After a stair simulator and treadmill workout, she does
a light free-weights routine and stretching exercises on a mat. When she's in
town on <DATE>Saturdays</DATE>, she's in the gym again, but not until <TIME>8 a.m.</TIME>;    Three
times a week, she either swims a mile or runs an average of five miles in the
hills. Mountain bike rides on the <DATE>weekends last from two</DATE> to three hours. She
still scuba dives and tennis is next on her athletic agenda.;    RESULTS: "I
like the overall package that comes from being fit. You look and feel good. .
. . I never have to push myself because I enjoy it so much -- people who work
out regularly understand that.";    GOALS: "I might like to take up a
competitive sport," she says, "like tennis." She's been encouraged to consider
triathlons because "I can do everything I need to do," but she says she's not
sure she wants to give up parts of her current routine in order to do
specialized training.;    OBSTACLES: It's difficult getting up that early in
the <TIME>morning</TIME>, she admits, which is why the volume on her alarm clock is set
very high. "I've tried it both ways, but I always feel more refreshed after
going to the gym than by getting a few extra hours of sleep.";    TIPS AND
COMMENTS: "I don't feel like anything I do is exceptional. I also work hard at
my job, spend time with friends and take a class in the <TIME>evening</TIME>. I feel very
balanced because what I do makes me happy. And as a result, I stay in good
shape."  </TEXT>

<MEMO>  Health &amp; Fitness; How I Stay Fit  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     WEIGHT: 150 pounds;   PERSONAL: Married nine years; he has a son, age 19,
and two daughters, ages 13 and 15; and lives in <LOCATION>Castro Valley</LOCATION>;   OCCUPATION:
Dentist practicing in <LOCATION>Castro Valley</LOCATION>;   FITNESS BACKGROUND: Although <PERSON>Kvikstad</PERSON>
says he's always felt "athletically inclined," the only sport he participated
in that ever demanded a certain level of conditioning was hockey, which he
played while growing up in <LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION>. Golf was more to his liking and he's
"played a respectable game" since the age of 13.;   The son of parents who
fought heart disease, Kvikstad says he always knew he ought to be getting more
exercise. "I tried low-key jogging in college, but could never stay with it.";
  The need for a regular workout finally hit home when he started experiencing
shortness of breath on the golf course. He was 28 years old, "huffing and
puffing up the small inclines," when he became concerned about his well-being.
"Regular exercise finally became a primary motive in my life.";   Finding a
running partner was a key factor in achieving consistency, he says, "because
you have to show up." They didn't "push it" at first, averaging a mile three
times a week around a track. A year later he started "stretching out" the
distance to four or five miles each time out. When schedule conflicts made it
difficult to coordinate runs with a partner, he went solo. But, by then,
"running had become part of my lifestyle.";   REGIMEN: Kvikstad runs about
four miles three or four times a week -- unless he's training for a special
event. Then it's more. And he chooses at least one every year, to give him a
goal to work toward. During the <DATE>past 18 years</DATE>, he has finished more than 30
10Ks, four half-marathons and five marathons.;   <ORGANIZATION>Kvikstad</ORGANIZATION>'s introduction to
bicycling came when he met his wife. Although he found their camping and
cycling vacations enjoyable, his need for a greater challenge on a bike
prevailed. He has ridden the one-day <ORGANIZATION>Davis Double</ORGANIZATION> 200-mile bike ride, done
hill climbing on the <LOCATION>Markleeville</LOCATION> Death Ride and, in <DATE>August</DATE>, he finished a
bike tour across Oregon.;   He and his wife average 15 cross-country ski trips
each season, and he still plays golf about twice a month.;   RESULTS: "I'm
thin and fit, but there's always room for improvement.";   GOALS:
"Tentatively, to do a triathlon next year, if I can overcome one big obstacle
-- swimming. It's a skill I'd have to learn.";   OBSTACLES: "Getting out the
front door. It's a real struggle sometimes and all I can think about while
running are all the shortcuts. Then there's that level of guilt to deal with
if I didn't do it.";   TIPS AND COMMENTS: "As long as the joints hold up,"
Kvikstad plans to continue his routine indefinitely. "I still have trouble
with the inclines at the golf course," he says, "but now it's directly related
to how I did on the previous hole."  </TEXT>

2 THOUSAND OAKS ATHLETES HIT THEIR STRIDE IN LONG DISTANCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
<PERSON>Jack Nosco</PERSON> and <PERSON>Scott Willis</PERSON> have been eagerly planning their Thanksgiving 
weekend trip to <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>, but their agenda doesn't include indulging in turkey 
and an afternoon in front of the television watching football. 
</P>
<P>
Their itinerary: 
</P>
<P>
 Day 1: Fly to <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
 Day 2: Swim six miles. Ride bicycles 60 miles. 
</P>
<P>
 Day 3: Ride bicycles 172 miles. 
</P>
<P>
 Day 4: Run 52.4 miles. 
</P>
<P>
 Day 5: Return home, sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 The flight home will no doubt be a restful one for Nosco and <PERSON>Willis</PERSON>, Thousand 
Oaks roommates who measure athletic success in hours and miles rather than 
meters and minutes. 
</P>
<P>
For them, an Ironman triathlon (2.4-mile swim, 112-mile bike ride, 26.2-mile 
run) isn't a challenge. 
</P>
<P>
They would rather double the distance, or run 100 miles. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a feeling of anxiety there," <PERSON>Willis</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
"Because you don't know if you're going to finish. You might doubt yourself, 
but deep down you keep saying, 'I know I'll make it.' " 
</P>
<P>
The three-day <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION> ultra-triathlon is one of several ultra-distance races 
that have been scheduled in the last year. 
</P>
<P>
On <DATE>Labor Day weekend</DATE>, they competed in a double triathlon in <LOCATION>Huntsville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ala</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Nosco finished 14th out of 46 with a time of 27 hours, 30 minutes. <PERSON>Willis</PERSON> was 
22nd in 30 hours, 30 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
One of their recent excursions was the Angeles Crest 100-mile run. They ran on 
a winding, rocky path from <LOCATION>Wrightwood</LOCATION> to the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever someone can dream up, <PERSON>Jack</PERSON> and I will say, 'Yeah, we can do that,' " 
<PERSON>Willis</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
They'll try just about any distance, over any surface, in any conditions. They 
speak of running a 50-mile race in a downpour and 100-degree heat as if it were 
an early-morning jog through the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
"We're a little different than the average runner," said <PERSON>Willis</PERSON>, an aerospace 
engineer. "We could care less about conditions. We just run through them and 
see how we do it." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Willis</PERSON> and Nosco, both 27, have a variety of reasons for trying these 
distances, money not being one of them. 
</P>
<P>
A T-shirt or a silver belt buckle is usually the only reward in ultra-distance 
events, which have yet to lure the corporate sponsorship and interest of 
biathlons and triathlons. 
</P>
<P>
Competing can be expensive. A local bike shop donates parts and other 
equipment, but <LOCATION>Nosco</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Willis</PERSON> pay for their own shoes, gas, entry fees and 
hotels. 
</P>
<P>
Entry fees can be as much as <MONEY>$200</MONEY>. 
</P>
<P>
Nosco, a fireman, and <PERSON>Willis</PERSON> have run nearly a dozen 50-mile races and four 
100-milers in the past three years. <PERSON>Willis</PERSON> has finished every race. Nosco has 
dropped out of two 100-milers because of swollen feet. 
</P>
<P>
Their injury list is short, but painful -- swollen feet, lost toenails and sore 
muscles are most common. "People say that when I'm 35 my knees will go and I'll 
start paying for doing this," <PERSON>Nosco</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
"But they don't realize that most of the people doing these (distances) are 35 
to 55 years old. It's almost like people don't want to accept these distances." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Willis</PERSON> said he burns about 1,000 calories in an hour of racing and has lost up 
to 10 pounds when competing. 
</P>
<P>
He and Nosco eat and drink a variety of foods, some nutritious, some not, 
during a race. 
</P>
<P>
"We eat a lot of cookies and candy bars to get a lot of sugar early in the 
race," <PERSON>Nosco</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
"You get kind of sick of that food. We even tried baby food." 
</P>
<P>
Their biggest concern is to keep nutrient and energy levels at proper levels. 
Parents and girlfriends supply them with food, sodas, split times and 
encouragement. "I think our family and friends are into it as much as we are," 
<PERSON>Willis</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
Neither <PERSON>Willis</PERSON> nor Nosco had much interest in running when they were young. 
</P>
<P>
They played football at <LOCATION>Newbury Park High</LOCATION> -- Nosco was a tight end and 
defensive end, <PERSON>Willis</PERSON> a guard and linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
"I hated running in high school," <PERSON>Nosco</PERSON> said. "The furthest I had run in high 
school was the 40-yard dash, or maybe a lap if I got in trouble in football 
practice." 
</P>
<P>
But Nosco started running at age 20 in an attempt to stay in shape. He also 
swam and rode his bike, eventually working up to the triathlon distance. 
</P>
<P>
Two years later he bought a condominium with <PERSON>Willis</PERSON>, and convinced his roommate 
to start training with him. 
</P>
<P>
"We ran in a 10-miler in <DATE>1986</DATE> and <PERSON>Scott</PERSON> was really sucking wind," <PERSON>Nosco</PERSON> said. 
"But <DATE>one month later</DATE> we ran the <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> marathon." 
</P>
<P>
Both finished, and they tried a 50-mile race a few months later. 
</P>
<P>
And they've been running ever since.

TRYING TO MAKE CENTS FROM A RACKET; 
</P>
<P>
CALABASAS' STEVE WIERE LEAVES COLLEGE A YEAR EARLY TO GIVE PROFESSIONAL TENNIS 
A TRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIRBY LEE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A single notion occupies the thoughts and influences the actions of <PERSON>Steve 
Wiere</PERSON>. It's one that made him leave college after three years and the same one 
that sends him through rigorous five-hour workouts every day. 
</P>
<P>
Wiere is pursuing a professional tennis career. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew when I was 12 that playing tennis was the only thing I wanted to do," 
said <PERSON>Wiere</PERSON>, a 21-year-old from <LOCATION>Calabasas</LOCATION> who previously competed in soccer, 
track, swimming and gymnastics as well as tennis. 
</P>
<P>
For Wiere, success came quickly and now his early ambitions may be a step 
closer to reality. 
</P>
<P>
At 12, Wiere was ranked in the top 20 in his age division in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>. As a 
14-year-old, he was ranked 18th in the state and 22nd in the country. 
</P>
<P>
In his sophomore year at <LOCATION>Calabasas</LOCATION> High in <DATE>1984</DATE>, Wiere teamed with <PERSON>Steve 
Oliver</PERSON>, another sophomore, to become the youngest doubles team in 52 years to 
win a Southern Section individual championship. 
</P>
<P>
Wiere led the Coyotes to four consecutive <ORGANIZATION>Frontier League</ORGANIZATION> and Southern Section 
3-A titles and, as a senior, he was runner-up in the individual <ORGANIZATION>Southern 
Section</ORGANIZATION> state singles competition. 
</P>
<P>
Despite being recruited by <ORGANIZATION>UC Irvine</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Cal State Long Beach</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>, Wiere 
chose to take his talents to the <LOCATION>Midwest</LOCATION> to compete for <PERSON>Carl Neufeld</PERSON> at 
<LOCATION>Northern Illinois</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Neufeld</PERSON>, who recently was appointed as an assistant at <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION>, saw Wiere playing 
at a tournament in <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION> as a junior. 
</P>
<P>
"I kind of recruited him personally," he recalled. " I saw a lot of potential 
and just kept in contact with him. He was a good student and I was recruiting 
academics. That was most important." 
</P>
<P>
Some people thought that <PERSON>Wiere</PERSON> had lost his mind when he headed east to the 
rarely defrosted DeKalb campus, located 60 miles west of <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>. But <PERSON>Neufeld</PERSON> 
eased Wiere's worries about freezing to death by inviting him to visit the 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted him to see this place in the <DATE>winter</DATE>," <PERSON>Neufeld</PERSON> said. "I wanted him to 
see that it wasn't 80 degrees below zero and that we don't walk around in space 
suits." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the concerns, <PERSON>Wiere</PERSON> was happy with his choice. 
</P>
<P>
"I needed a change. It gets boring living in perfect weather all the time," 
<PERSON>Wiere</PERSON> said. "I visited the school and talked to the players. I just fell in 
love with the area." 
</P>
<P>
His opponents, though, might have wished Wiere stayed home. 
</P>
<P>
As the <ORGANIZATION>Huskies</ORGANIZATION>' No. 1 player, <PERSON>Wiere</PERSON> has compiled a three-year record of 90-25, 
including a visit to the <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> tennis tournament in singles competition as a 
freshman. 
</P>
<P>
Now, however, <LOCATION>Wiere</LOCATION>, a sports business major, has decided to forgo his final 
year at <LOCATION>Northern Illinois</LOCATION>. He believes that he is ready to take the plunge into 
the professional tennis world. 
</P>
<P>
"I talked it over with my dad and I just thought that the time was right. He's 
kind of disappointed that I didn't finish my degree, but he's given me his full 
support," <PERSON>Wiere</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
His father, <PERSON>Peter</PERSON>, acknowledged that support: "He's done well in college and it 
seems logical for him to give (professional tennis) a try. He's starting to get 
results and I like to see him reach his potential. I think he has the 
capability to be ranked among the top 100 in the world." 
</P>
<P>
Neufeld would have preferred to see Wiere graduate before tackling the pros, 
but the coach believes in his protege's ability. 
</P>
<P>
"He's really progressed since he's been here and has done just about everything 
he could do. There was little more to prove. He was one of the top players in 
the <LOCATION>Midwest</LOCATION>," <PERSON>Neufeld</PERSON> said. "I have no doubt he has the potential to be a pro 
player. My recommendation to him was to just try it and see how he does." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Neufeld</PERSON> said that it wouldn't hurt Wiere to take a year off from school to 
pursue tennis. He would still retain a year of eligibility to compete 
collegiately with the exception of <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> tournament play. 
</P>
<P>
Wiere, however, is rather unconcerned about returning to the university level, 
saying, "I have confidence I can make it in the pros. If I didn't, I wouldn't 
have made the decision. I really don't see myself playing any more college 
tennis." 
</P>
<P>
If early results are an indication, Wiere might know what he's talking about. 
</P>
<P>
He made a surprising showing in last month's <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION>Volvo Tennis Wild-Card</ORGANIZATION> 
tournament, which served as a qualifier for the actual qualifying for the 
event. Wiere, who was unseeded, raised some eyebrows when he advanced to the 
final round of the 200-player tournament before losing. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a major breakthrough for me," <PERSON>Wiere</PERSON> said. "Deep inside, I was hoping I 
could make it to <ORGANIZATION>Volvo</ORGANIZATION>. But to get as close as I did really boosted my 
confidence." 
</P>
<P>
Then, fresh off his performance at the <ORGANIZATION>Volvo</ORGANIZATION> tournament, Wiere reached the 
final of the <LOCATION>Long Beach Open</LOCATION> <DATE>two weeks later</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
The seeding committee, obviously impressed by his play two weeks earlier, made 
Wiere the third-seeded player in the 258-player tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Since leaving <ORGANIZATION>Northern Illinois</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>June</DATE>, <PERSON>Wiere</PERSON> has compiled a record of 42-6 in 
nine tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
At 6-foot-1, 180 pounds, Wiere looks more like a football defensive back than a 
tennis player. Yet Wiere, who works out three to five hours a day incorporating 
running, biking and swimming into his training regimen, says that his size is 
an advantage. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a lot bigger than most players, but I think I'm a lot stronger. My 
conditioning and especially my endurance also plays a big part and helps a lot 
toward the end of matches," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Neufeld added: "<PERSON>Steve</PERSON>'s a pretty big guy, but quick for his size. He plays a 
very aggressive game. He's got a real big serve and it's going to get bigger." 
</P>
<P>
What will it take for Wiere to make it in pro tennis? To reach that place among 
the top 100 or so pros? 
</P>
<P>
Neufeld says that Wiere needs to work on his play at the net. 
</P>
<P>
"We've worked very hard on his serve-and-volley game and it's improved, but how 
much it improves will determine how far he can go," <PERSON>Neufeld</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
"<PERSON>Steve</PERSON>'s like a skyrocket," said <PERSON>Mark Winters</PERSON>, a regular observer of the pro 
tennis scene and public-relations director at the <ORGANIZATION>L.A. Tennis Center</ORGANIZATION>. "He can 
be really hot or cold at times. But if he holds it together for an entire 
match, he's really tough to beat." 
</P>
<P>
Wiere is preparing to compete in the ATP Nissan/Hawaiian circuit tour later 
this month before leaving for <LOCATION>South America</LOCATION> in <DATE>January</DATE> to play in four 
tournaments in <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>. "After that, I should have a good 
idea of how well I stack up," he said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> on <DATE>Friday</DATE> awarded the <PERSON>Flo Hyman
Award</PERSON> for excellence in sports to former tennis pro <PERSON>Chris Evert</PERSON>,
calling her ``the role model for our nation's young women.''
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> presented the award at the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> on behalf of the
Women and Girls in Sports Foundation, following activities for
<ORGANIZATION>National Girls and Women</ORGANIZATION> in Sports Day on <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   The award is given in memory of the Olympic volleyball star who
died suddenly in <DATE>1986</DATE>.
   In presenting <LOCATION>Evert</LOCATION> the glass trophy, <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> said the winner of 18
Grand Slam tournaments had ``represented not just the game of
tennis, but your country. And you've done it so very well and with
grace, dignity and good sportsmanship.''
   ``I know that all of your friends and colleagues here will agree
that you certainly are the role model for our nation's young women,
and we all miss you on the professional tennis circuit,'' <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> said.
   The president quipped, however, that tennis pros <PERSON>Pam Shriver</PERSON> and
<LOCATION>Martina Navratilova</LOCATION>, who waged tough matches against <LOCATION>Evert</LOCATION>, ``won't
miss you on the tennis circuit.''
   <PERSON>Evert</PERSON> said she wanted to stress the importance of physical
education in schools and sought the president's help in pushing
that point as part of his education package.
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> told the small gathering of female athletes that his wife
<PERSON>Barbara</PERSON> ``is this very moment out swimming her mile.''
   <PERSON>Mrs. Bush</PERSON> swims at least a mile each day in the outdoor <ORGANIZATION>White
House</ORGANIZATION> pool.

<TEXT>     "A world record is a real possibility in the women's race," said <PERSON>Bob
Bowman</PERSON>, chairman of the World Cup organizing committee, who said the idea to
put the races in the <PERSON>Jenner</PERSON> is to get the little-known sport more exposure.;  
 Scheduled to compete in the women's field are world-record holder <PERSON>Kerry Saxby</PERSON>
of <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>, who did a 20-minute, 17.19-second 5-kilometer race in <DATE>January
1990</DATE>; <PERSON>Nadezhda Ryashkina</PERSON> of the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>, who set the 10,000-meter world
mark in last <DATE>summer</DATE>'s Goodwill Games; <DATE>1989</DATE> World Cup champion <PERSON>Beate Anders</PERSON> of
<LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>, whose 20:07.52 race last <DATE>June</DATE> is pending as the new 5K world record;
and Italians <PERSON>Ileana Salvador</PERSON>, former 5K and 10K record holder, and <PERSON>Anna Rita
Sidoti</PERSON>, <DATE>1990</DATE> European champion.;    The 5K is a recognized distance for women,
who will race in the Olympics for the first time next <DATE>summer</DATE>. The men's race
is considered more of an exhibition since 20K and 50K are their Olympic
distances.;  HORSING AROUND: Part of the <ORGANIZATION>Pan American Games</ORGANIZATION> trials for
three-day eventing, the most grueling equestrian event for horses and riders,
will be held <DATE>May 24-27</DATE> at the CTETA Horse Park off <LOCATION>Sand Hill Road</LOCATION> in
<LOCATION>Woodside.</LOCATION>;    The competition consists of a dressage test on the first day, a
10-mile endurance run on the second day including a mile-long steeplechase
over fences and a cross-country gallop, and show jumping on the final day.;   
The <ORGANIZATION>Pan Am</ORGANIZATION> Games' three-day eventing competition will be held <DATE>Nov. 7-10</DATE> in
<LOCATION>Chatsworth</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ga.</LOCATION>;  TOURIST TURMOIL: Fans planning to attend either of the <DATE>1992</DATE>
Olympic Games should plan now on how they're going to get to the venues,
because it's going to be tough.;    The New York Times recently recommended
either a helicopter or a hang glider to get to the competition at <DATE>February</DATE>'s
<DATE>Winter</DATE> Games.;    <LOCATION>While Albertville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, is the host site, only figure
skating and speed skating will actually be held there. The rest of the events
are scheduled in nine different towns (seven different sites for skiing
alone), all reachable only by narrow mountain roads.;    The <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> Times
reported a recent traffic jam in <LOCATION>Barcelona</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>, site of the Summer Games,
involved 300,000 vehicles stretching 25 miles.;    It was caused by Olympic
construction, but with 420 cars per 1,000 residents, <LOCATION>Barcelona</LOCATION> has the
second-highest ratio in the world.;  JENNER TAKE TWO: <PERSON>PattiSue Plumer</PERSON> plans a
difficult double in the <PERSON>Jenner</PERSON>, running the 1,500 early in the day and then
coming back in the 3,000, according to <PERSON>Bert Bonanno</PERSON>, meet director.;    He
said one of <PERSON>Plumer</PERSON>'s opponents in the 3,000 will be Polish marathoner <PERSON>Wanda
Panfil</PERSON>, who won last month's <LOCATION>Boston Marathon</LOCATION> and was second-ranked in that
event last year by <ORGANIZATION>Track &amp; Field News.</ORGANIZATION>;    Also expected to compete is British
miler <PERSON>Steve Cram</PERSON> in the men's 3,000.;  NO HANDICAP: Disabled athletes may
compete in the '96 <LOCATION>Atlanta Olympics</LOCATION> -- not in separate categories, but in
mainstream competition.;    A joint program of the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Canoe</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Kayak Team</ORGANIZATION>,
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> (<LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION>) <ORGANIZATION>Canoe Club</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>National Handicapped Sports</ORGANIZATION> is developing
technology to allow athletes with lower limb disabilities to be comfortably
positioned in the craft.;    Because canoe and kayak paddlers depend nearly
entirely on upper-body strength, it's believed athletes with lower-limb
disabilities may be able to compete equally with the able-bodied.;  AREA
ATHLETES: <ORGANIZATION>Santa Clara Swim Club</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Jay Fitzgerald</PERSON> has been named men's coach
for the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> team at this <DATE>summer</DATE>'s <ORGANIZATION>World University Games</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Sheffield</LOCATION>,

TORRANCE'S TOM AAKER HAS GOOD CAUSE TO FINISH L.A. MARATHON TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE GARCIA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although he enters two marathons a year, <PERSON>Tom Aaker</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Torrance</LOCATION> has never cared 
much about the extravagant prizes awarded to the top finisher or even about the 
<MONEY>several hundred dollars</MONEY> awarded to each of the first 10 runners who cross the 
finish line. 
</P>
<P>
Today won't be any different. 
</P>
<P>
While elite athletes conquer the <ORGANIZATION>26.2-mile Los Angeles Marathon</ORGANIZATION> course with 
material goals in mind -- the top female and male finishers will each receive 
<MONEY>$26,385</MONEY>, a <ORGANIZATION>Mercedes-Benz</ORGANIZATION> sedan and an 18-karat gold sports watch -- <PERSON>Aaker</PERSON> will 
do it to help the needy. 
</P>
<P>
The 26-year-old <PERSON>Aaker</PERSON> will run the fourth annual race through the streets of 
downtown <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> to raise funds for victims of domestic violence and 
impoverished children. 
</P>
<P>
Aaker knows he doesn't stand a chance against the elite on such a grueling 
course. After all, he's only a semi-hardcore distance runner, training an 
average of 60 miles a week on <ORGANIZATION>Redondo Beach</ORGANIZATION>'s bike path and <ORGANIZATION>West Torrance 
High</ORGANIZATION>'s track. 
</P>
<P>
He maintains a strict diet and has finished five marathons (<LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>San 
Francisco</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Portland</LOCATION> and twice in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>), but he probably won't come close to 
matching the top female runner's time today, and he'll finish at least half an 
hour behind the top male runner. 
</P>
<P>
The monetary reward the 5-foot-11, 145-pound associate investment manager 
expects to receive from the race won't come from placing high. Instead, <PERSON>Aaker</PERSON> 
will get about <MONEY>$1</MONEY> a mile from each of several sponsors -- after he finishes the 
course. 
</P>
<P>
"Those runners are so good," <PERSON>Aaker</PERSON> said, "and so far ahead that I never find 
myself running with them. I'm always quite a ways behind the leaders. I don't 
enter races to compete against others, specially not them. I do it because I 
really enjoy running, and I like to compete against myself." 
</P>
<P>
Aaker's best time, 2:54.57, came at the <ORGANIZATION>Chicago Marathon</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1987</DATE>. His last big 
race was the <LOCATION>Portland Marathon</LOCATION> <DATE>last September</DATE>, which he ran in 3:19. 
</P>
<P>
Last year's <LOCATION>L.A.</LOCATION> Marathon winner, <PERSON>Martin Mondragon</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>, finished in 
2:10.11. The female winner, also from <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>, was <PERSON>Blanca Haime</PERSON>, who ran it in 
2:36.11. 
</P>
<P>
Both <PERSON>Mondragon</PERSON> and <PERSON>Haime</PERSON> will compete today in a field of about 17,000 runners 
that includes <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Taisuke Kodama</PERSON>, former South African <PERSON>Mark Plaatjes</PERSON> and 
American <PERSON>Greg Meyer</PERSON>. Kodama's best mark (2:07.35) is very close to the world 
marathon record of 2:07.11, and <PERSON>Plaatjes</PERSON> has run a 2:08.58 marathon. 
</P>
<P>
The top women include <LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Rosa Mota</PERSON> and the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Zoya Ivanova</PERSON>. 
Mota has come within two minutes of the women's world marathon record of 
2:21.06, and <PERSON>Ivanova</PERSON> has come within about seven minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Stiff competition for a part-time runner who competes for fun and worthy 
causes. 
</P>
<P>
That's why <PERSON>Aaker</PERSON>, who graduated from <ORGANIZATION>Loyola Marymount University</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1984</DATE> and 
received a master's degree from <ORGANIZATION>Northwestern University</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1986</DATE>, has found a 
different incentive to finish the lengthy race. 
</P>
<P>
He hopes to raise <MONEY>$1,000</MONEY> in pledges, which will go to an <ORGANIZATION>All Nations Foundation</ORGANIZATION> 
camp in the <ORGANIZATION>Angeles National Forest</ORGANIZATION>. Since the <DATE>1920s</DATE>, the foundation has 
operated camping programs for inner-city kids and battered women and children. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Karen Holmes</PERSON>, <PERSON>Aaker</PERSON>'s colleague at <ORGANIZATION>Prudential Capital Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, asked him to 
represent the charity when she learned that he planned to run in the marathon.

"He agreed right away," said <PERSON>Holmes</PERSON>, whose parents are volunteer workers for 
the charity foundation. "We raised about <MONEY>$7,000</MONEY> last year. The race really 
helps us a lot. It's great that <PERSON>Tom</PERSON> is doing this." 
</P>
<P>
While <PERSON>Aaker</PERSON> is concentrating heavily on finishing today's marathon to collect 
the pledges, he plans to run in many more. He started running as a high school 
tennis player and completed his first marathon in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> in <DATE>1986</DATE> in 
3:35. 
</P>
<P>
Marathons are a big part of his life, he says, just like shedding his suit and 
tie to prepare for a run on the beach at the end of a long work day. 
</P>
<P>
"I just want to run in them forever," <PERSON>Aaker</PERSON> said. "I really do. I'm going to do 
this for a long time. I even want to run in a marathon overseas someday." 
</P>
<P>
Today, however, he'll dash through the not-so-scenic streets of downtown <LOCATION>L.A.</LOCATION> 
for a good cause.

<LEADPARA>  Billie Jean King is much more than a famous tennis player.;   What started
nearly 20 years ago as a bid to promote women's tennis soon expanded well
beyond that. With her victory in an exhibition over Bobby Riggs in 1973, she
became a leading figure in the women's movement. A symbol of success.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  BEATING RIGGS PROPELLED KING INTO WOMEN'S RIGHTS  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Bay Area's Best of the Best; No. 10: Billie Jean King  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     It hit home in <DATE>1989</DATE> when Life magazine named her one of the 100 most
important Americans in the <DATE>20th century</DATE>. It underlined graphically that her
off-court fame had transcended her on-court fame, a fact duly noted by a panel
of <ORGANIZATION>Mercury News</ORGANIZATION> experts that ranked her 10th on a list of the 20 most
important <LOCATION>Bay Area</LOCATION> sports personalities of the <DATE>last 20 years.</DATE>;   "The Life
thing did knock me out," <PERSON>King</PERSON>, 48, said recently. "It goes way beyond being an
athlete. They only chose 100 people. The only other athletes named were Babe
<PERSON>Ruth</PERSON>, <PERSON>Jackie Robinson</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Muhammad Ali</ORGANIZATION>. Wow, you talk about an elite group."; 
 While King was pondering how a chubby little girl in eye glasses who learned
tennis on the public courts of <LOCATION>Long Beach</LOCATION> could rise to such heights, others
hailed the honor as richly deserved.;   "<PERSON>Billie Jean</PERSON>, growing up, was
motivated by a deep sense of equity," said <PERSON>Deborah Anderson</PERSON>, director of the
<ORGANIZATION>Women's Sports Foundation</ORGANIZATION>, an organization founded by King. "This was
instilled in her by her parents. Her father would play catch with her brother
(<PERSON>Randy Moffitt</PERSON>), who became a major league pitcher. Then he would play catch
with Billie.;   "And then when she beat <PERSON>Bobby Riggs</PERSON> in <DATE>1973</DATE> with 50 million
people watching, her victory became bigger than tennis. What she did helped
women realize they could set goals and reach them, especially in the business
world.";   <PERSON>King</PERSON> said <PERSON>Riggs</PERSON>, then 59, a publicity-driven hustler and male
chauvinist, proposed the match as a money-maker. King was hesitant. She feared
if she lost it would hurt women's tennis. So <PERSON>Riggs</PERSON> went to <PERSON>Margaret Court</PERSON>, who
agreed to play.;   "<PERSON>Margaret</PERSON> played for the money," <PERSON>King</PERSON> said, referring to a
<MONEY>$35,000</MONEY> payoff. "She didn't understand this was much bigger than a tennis
match. I said, '<PERSON>Margaret</PERSON>, this will be a circus. Your whole life will change.'
I helped coach her, but <PERSON>Margaret</PERSON> choked and <PERSON>Riggs</PERSON> killed her.;   "Play her
normal game and she'd have won. The loss left the public feeling women were
spastic. I knew then I had to play him.";   King, then 29, drubbed <PERSON>Riggs</PERSON> in
three sets, running him to exhaustion.;   The episode boosted tennis and added
fuel to <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s various ventures.;   A <LOCATION>Bay Area</LOCATION> resident on and off for 12
years through <DATE>1976</DATE>, <PERSON>King</PERSON> let her creative juices flow. Working with her
lawyer-husband, <PERSON>Larry</PERSON>, she pushed the women's pro tour, started magazines,
founded the <ORGANIZATION>Women's Tennis Association</ORGANIZATION> and launched TeamTennis. She even
coached a team. Along the way she won 22 Wimbledon titles and was ranked No. 1
in singles in five different years.; The panel; Here's the panel of experts
that selected the <LOCATION>Bay Area</LOCATION>'s top 20 sports personalities of the past 20
years:;   <PERSON>Maren Seidler</PERSON>, four-time Olympic shot-putter; <PERSON>Jan Hutchins</PERSON>, news

A BUSY EVANS TO COMPETE IN MEET BEGINNING TODAY

<TEXT>
<P>
<PERSON>Janet Evans</PERSON>, who took very little time off after the Olympics in <LOCATION>Seoul</LOCATION> <DATE>last 
September</DATE> before getting back into her incredible training regimen, somehow 
managed to train, handle a crush of requests for appearances, parades and award 
dinners and still compete for <LOCATION>Placentia</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>El Dorado High School</ORGANIZATION> and her 
<ORGANIZATION>Fullerton Aquatics Sports Team</ORGANIZATION>, knocking off distance swim records all along 
the way. 
</P>
<P>
She's tough over the long haul. 
</P>
<P>
Today, just one day after her high school graduation ceremonies, <PERSON>Evans</PERSON> is 
opening her long-course season in the Swim Meet of Champions at <LOCATION>Mission Viejo</LOCATION>. 
Evans will swim the 800 at <TIME>4 p.m.</TIME> and will compete every day in the meet that 
continues through <DATE>Sunday</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Evans also plans to swim the 200-meter freestyle, 200-meter backstroke, 
200-meter breaststroke, 200-meter butterfly, 200-meter individual medley, 
400-meter individual medley and the 400-meter freestyle. 
</P>
<P>
Finals start at <TIME>5 p.m.</TIME> <DATE>Friday, Saturday</DATE> and <DATE>Sunday</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Evans, who will be attending Stanford in the <DATE>fall</DATE> and swimming there under the 
direction of <PERSON>Richard Quick</PERSON>, former Olympic coach and former women's coach at 
the <ORGANIZATION>University of Texas</ORGANIZATION>, has been working with <PERSON>Don Wagner</PERSON>, the new coach of her 
<ORGANIZATION>Fullerton Aquatics</ORGANIZATION> team. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Wagner</PERSON>, a former assistant at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Arizona</ORGANIZATION>, replaced <PERSON>Bud 
McAllister</PERSON>, who coached <PERSON>Evans</PERSON> to three Olympic gold medals before moving on to 
a club in <LOCATION>Orlando</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
In <DATE>January</DATE>, <PERSON>Evans</PERSON> broke the 1,650-yard freestyle record that had been set by 
<ORGANIZATION>Olympian Tiffany Cohen</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1983</DATE>. She lowered it from 15 minutes 46.54 seconds to 
15:44.98. And in <DATE>March</DATE>, at the <LOCATION>Phillips</LOCATION> 66/U.S. <ORGANIZATION>Swimming Short Course Nationals</ORGANIZATION> 
in <LOCATION>Chapel Hill</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.C.</LOCATION>, she broke <PERSON>Cohen</PERSON>'s American record in the 1,000-yard 
freestyle. She lowered that record from 9:28.32 to 9:25.49. 
</P>
<P>
It may take her a meet or two to get up to speed in this long-course season, 
but <PERSON>Evans</PERSON> is planning to compete in all the major meets. She is one of the 
stars that <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Swimming is planning to use both in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>, at the <ORGANIZATION>Pan Pacific</ORGANIZATION> 
meet, and in <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>, against the Soviets, just days later. 
</P>
<P>
If anyone can do it . . . 
</P>
<P>
The annual meet at <LOCATION>Mission Viejo</LOCATION> has recently acquired <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler</ORGANIZATION> as a sponsor, 
which could mean that it will again be able to pay travel expenses for the top 
caliber swimmers who used to be attracted to the meet when it was sponsored by 
Seventeen magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the swimmers on the <LOCATION>West Coast</LOCATION> are competing either in the <LOCATION>Santa Clara</LOCATION> 
meet <DATE>July 7-9</DATE> or in the <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> Invitational <DATE>July 13-16</DATE>. East Coast 
swimmers will be competing in the <LOCATION>Charlotte Ultra</LOCATION> Swim Invitational <DATE>June 22-25</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>Los Angeles Invitational</ORGANIZATION>, which will be held at <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION>, has drawn not only 
<PERSON>Evans</PERSON>, but also Olympian Sylvia Poll of <LOCATION>Costa Rica</LOCATION>. USC Olympians <PERSON>Dave Wharton</PERSON> 
and <PERSON>Dan Jorgensen</PERSON> are also scheduled to compete. 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>L.A. Invitational</ORGANIZATION> will be televised by <ORGANIZATION>TBS</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
All of the early <DATE>summer</DATE> meets are tuneups for the Phillips 66/U.S. <ORGANIZATION>Swimming 
Long Course National Championships</ORGANIZATION>, which also will be held at <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION>, <DATE>July 
31-Aug</DATE>. 4. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Matt Biondi</PERSON> is not ready to say when he plans to race again, but there is 
little doubt that he will. Somehow, somewhere and no doubt for some profit, 
<PERSON>Biondi</PERSON> will sprint against his old nemesis, <PERSON>Tom Jager</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
If <PERSON>Biondi</PERSON> chooses to skip the long-course national meet and, therefore, the <ORGANIZATION>Pan 
Pacific</ORGANIZATION> meet, it is likely that he will swim a match race with Jager -- a 
prospect that no doubt would attract network television. 
</P>
<P>
Biondi quit the national water polo team last week just before reporting to the 
<LOCATION>Bahamas</LOCATION> for the filming of a <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION> project in which, of course, he swims with the 
dolphins he has grown to love. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Biondi</PERSON> has not raced since his final Olympic event last <DATE>September</DATE>. He swam the 
butterfly leg for the 400-meter medley relay that won gold, and then announced 
that he would be putting all of his athletic efforts into making the national 
water polo team. 
</P>
<P>
Working with the water polo team has kept him in shape, and he would certainly 
be of value to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> team -- especially on the relays -- if he did decide to 
qualify for the <ORGANIZATION>Pan Pacific</ORGANIZATION> meet. As <PERSON>Jeff Dimond</PERSON> of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Swimming put it: "If 
<PERSON>Matt</PERSON> decides to swim again, we'll be turning cartwheels." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Pat Hines</PERSON> will defend her title as women's champion in the <LOCATION>United States Ten 
Mile Swim</LOCATION> in this year's ocean race along a course that runs between <LOCATION>Huntington 
Beach</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Seal Beach</ORGANIZATION>. Hines is using the race to gain attention for her quest 
to make an endurance swim an Olympic event. 
</P>
<P>
She would like to see a 10-mile swim become a demonstration event in <DATE>1992</DATE> and a 
medal event by <DATE>1996</DATE>. According to <LOCATION>Hines</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Swimming and its masters program 
have submitted the event for Olympic consideration. 
</P>
<P>
"Endurance swimming deserves Olympic status," she says. "It is an international 
sport, it demands the highest levels of skill and training, and it is 
incredibly exciting." 
</P>
<P>
Swimming Notes 
</P>
<P>
The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> sent a team of swimmers to the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> for a meet at 
<LOCATION>Tallinn</LOCATION> <DATE>June 2-4</DATE> and the young women fared surprisingly well. They won nine 
gold medals, seven silver and one bronze in the 16 events, including an upset 
gold in the 400-meter medley relay. <PERSON>Pam Minthorn</PERSON>, 18, of <LOCATION>Gaithersburg</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Md.</LOCATION>, who 
swims for <ORGANIZATION>Curl-Burke Swim Club</ORGANIZATION>, won the 200-meter freestyle in 2:02.32, the 
100-meter butterfly in 1:01.5, and the 200-meter butterfly in 2:13.18. Summer 
<PERSON>Sanders</PERSON>, 16, of <LOCATION>Roseville</LOCATION>, who swims for the <ORGANIZATION>California Capital Aquatics</ORGANIZATION>, won 
both individual medleys. . . . <PERSON>Don Gambril</PERSON> has been named coach of the men's 
team and <PERSON>Dick Shoulberg</PERSON> has been named coach of the women's team for the <ORGANIZATION>Pan 
Pacific Games</ORGANIZATION>, the Alamo Cup and the World Cup meet to be held in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> in 
<DATE>January</DATE>.
