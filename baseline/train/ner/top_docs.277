   The number of inmates in <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> prisons jumped by
a record <PERCENT>7.3 percent</PERCENT> during the <DATE>first half of 1989</DATE> to a total of
673,565 inmates, the <ORGANIZATION>Bureau of Justice Statistics</ORGANIZATION> says.
   The six-month increase of 46,004 inmates was higher than any
full-year increase recorded during the 64 years that the government
has counted prisoners, the bureau said <DATE>Sunday</DATE>.
   The largest annual increase ever recorded was in <DATE>1981-82</DATE>, when
the national prison population grew by 41,060 inmates, from 344,283
to 385,343, said <PERSON>Tom Hester</PERSON> of the bureau.
   The surge in prison population during the <DATE>first half of 1989</DATE> was
brought about by increases of <PERCENT>7 percent</PERCENT> in the number of men
imprisoned and <PERCENT>13 percent</PERCENT> in the number of women, the bureau said.
   Attorney General <PERSON>Dick Thornburgh</PERSON> said the increase was ``an
indication that more criminals, many convicted of drug-related
offenses, are being caught and punished.''
   ``The criminal justice system is working,'' <PERSON>Thornburgh</PERSON> said in a
statement. ``People who break the law do pay the price.''
   The figures dramatize the need for almost 1,800 new prison beds a
week, the bureau said. ``<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> needs to act swiftly on President
<PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s violent crime legislation, which provides for the
construction of more than 24,000 new federal prison beds,''
<PERSON>Thornburgh</PERSON> said.
   The national drug control strategy, announced by <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> last
<DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, echoed the crime legislation <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> called for in <DATE>May</DATE> in
seeking <MONEY>$1.2 billion</MONEY> in <DATE>1990</DATE> budget authorization for additional
federal prison space.
   Most of the increase from <DATE>Dec. 31, 1988</DATE>, to <DATE>June 30, 1989</DATE>,
occurred in the state prison systems, where the population grew by
41,214 or <PERCENT>7.1 percent</PERCENT>, from 577,633 at the end of <DATE>1988</DATE> to 618,847 at
the end of <DATE>June</DATE>. During the same period, the federal prison
population expanded by 4,790, a <PERCENT>9.7 percent</PERCENT> increase from 49,928 to
54,718.
   During the six-month period, nine jurisdictions reported
double-digit growth in their inmate populations: <LOCATION>Rhode Island</LOCATION>, <PERCENT>20.3
percent</PERCENT>; <LOCATION>South Dakota</LOCATION>, <PERCENT>19.9 percent</PERCENT>; <LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION>, <PERCENT>18.4 percent</PERCENT>;
<LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION>, <PERCENT>13.2 percent</PERCENT>; the <LOCATION>District of Columbia</LOCATION>, <PERCENT>12.1 percent</PERCENT>; <LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION>,
<PERCENT>11.3 percent</PERCENT>; <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION>, <PERCENT>10.6 percent</PERCENT>; <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION>, <PERCENT>10.4 percent</PERCENT>; and
<LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION>, <PERCENT>10.2 percent</PERCENT>.
   Two states experienced declines in prison populations _
<LOCATION>Tennessee</LOCATION>, down <PERCENT>2.3 percent</PERCENT>, and <LOCATION>North Dakota</LOCATION>, down <PERCENT>2.1 percent</PERCENT>. And
<LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> had such a small increase, only 2 prisoners more, that the
change was listed as <PERCENT>0 percent</PERCENT>.
   Since <DATE>1980</DATE>, the number of state and federal prisoners serving
sentences of more than one year _ known as sentenced prisoners _
more than doubled, from 315,974, while four states recorded a
tripling of such inmates _ <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New Hampshire</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New
Jersey</LOCATION>.
   An additional 25 states and the <ORGANIZATION>District of Columbia</ORGANIZATION> doubled
their prison populations.
   Overall, the number of sentenced prisoners as of <DATE>June 30</DATE> was 260
per 100,000 population, with 18 of them in federal prisons and 242
in state institutions. On <DATE>Dec. 31, 1980</DATE>, there were 139 sentenced
prisoners per 100,000 population, the bureau said.

<HL> REGIONS:
Multistate Lottery's Prospects
Grow, Even Absent Big States
---
By Eugene Carlson
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL>
<DD> 08/18/87</DD>
<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO>
<TEXT>
   RULE ONE in the lottery business: The bigger the jackpot, the more tickets you sell. 
So if you're running a state lottery that offers relatively small cash awards, and you know that hundreds -- perhaps thousands -- of your potential customers are playing the multimillion-dollar lottery in the big state next door, your strategy is pretty clear: Double, triple or quadruple your own grand prize, and keep those ticket sales at home. 

   That's exactly what <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION>, whose citizens are regular players in the wealthy lottery in neighboring <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>, hope to do. 
Starting early next year, <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION> plan to join forces with several other states in a coast-to-coast, multistate lottery. 

   The idea is to promote the same lottery"<LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s Game" is one of the names being considered -- in states from <LOCATION>Oregon</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Rhode Island</LOCATION>. 
The states would be linked by satellite every <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> for the weekly drawing. 

   The new game is likely to hurt ticket sales in participating states' existing lotteries. 
But organizers of the multistate game are betting that the public's usual response to lotteries will prevail. 
That is, a large population base will produce lots of ticket sales, which will build big jackpots, which will inspire even more sales, far outweighing any revenue loss in single-state games. 
As usual in the lottery business, the odds of winning will be infinitesimal. 

   THE BIG QUESTION is membership. 
Six states, with a combined population of 16 million, already are committed to the plan: <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Oregon</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Rhode Island</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION>. 
The <ORGANIZATION>District of Columbia</ORGANIZATION> says it's in, too. 
If past experience is any guide, that should make the multistate lottery one of the nation's richest games of chance. 

   It would be richer still if <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>, both early supporters of the multistate idea, weren't sitting on the sidelines. 
Illinois Gov. <PERSON>James Thompson</PERSON> is stringing out a decision whether to participate. 
<LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>'s lottery director, <PERSON>John Quinn</PERSON>, says his state won't play unless <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION> does. (<LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>'s legislature needs to approve the state's multistate membership; a bill to that effect apparently died last month when the assembly recessed.) 

   Signing up the two big states would triple the multistate lottery's projected population base to 45 million. 
The small states think this is wonderful, because residents of <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION> or <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION> would have a shot -- albeit tiny -- at a huge grand prize in a homestate lottery. 
Ticket sales in those states would presumably soar. 

   THE RATIONALE BEHIND LOTTERIES, after all, is to raise money for state government programs and thus ease the bite on taxpayers. 
Oregon's lottery, just two years old, has already earned <MONEY>$70 million</MONEY> for state economic development programs ranging from new university buildings to commercial fishing piers. 
In <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>, <PERCENT>42%</PERCENT> of lottery income goes to elementary and secondary schools. 
Last year, that came to <MONEY>$553 million</MONEY>. 

   Indeed, <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>, with its own popular lottery, has less incentive than the smaller states to join the multistate lottery. 
It was <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>, after all, that produced the richest prize won by a single ticketholder in a North American lottery: <MONEY>$40 million</MONEY> in <DATE>September 1984</DATE>. 
The huge pot came after the lottery went four weeks without a winner, the grand prize rolling over and growing each week. 

   "During those four weeks, we had tremendous ticket sales," recalls <PERSON>Michael Jones</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>'s lottery superintendent at the time and now a Chicago-based lottery consultant. 

   It's what lottery directors dream about: a game designed in such a way that every so often, no one wins the grand prize for two or three weeks in a row. 
The prize money builds, newspapers and television give the game big coverage, and people line up everywhere to buy tickets in a sort of gambler's feeding frenzy. 

   But <ORGANIZATION>Illinois</ORGANIZATION>'s grand prize hasn't come close to that level since , leading the state's lottery strategists to wonder how to boost business. 
One way is to join the multistate game. 
<PERSON>Rebecca Paul</PERSON>, who resigned as <ORGANIZATION>Illinois</ORGANIZATION>'s lottery director last week to head <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>'s new lottery, thinks that's the wave of the future. 
In <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Switzerland</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION>, multistate or multiprovince lotteries are the most widely played. 
"I think that's where we're headed three to five years from now," <PERSON>Ms. Paul</PERSON> says. 

   MR. JONES FORESEES a different format. 
"I see the large states getting together in a super lotto." 
He suggests a "triangle game" with <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>, or a Great Lakes regional lottery, with <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>. 
There is a precedent: <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New Hampshire</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Vermont</LOCATION> already run a lottery called <ORGANIZATION>Tristate Megabucks</ORGANIZATION>. 

   <PERSON>Ms. Paul</PERSON>, whose <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> game will begin <DATE>Jan. 15</DATE>, doesn't like the idea of such fragmented lotteries. 
"I think it's bad for the industry to have competing multistate games," she says. 

   Multistate games aren't the only way to draw more players; states can also change the odds on an existing game. 
Illinois did that in <DATE>April</DATE>, introducing a new <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> lotto drawing that makes it easier to win a cheap prize (last week it was one chance in 89 to win <MONEY>$12</MONEY> on a <MONEY>$1</MONEY> ticket), but tougher to win the grand prize (one chance in 15.4 million). 
The idea paid off late last month, when the jackpot reached <MONEY>$22 million</MONEY>, <ORGANIZATION>Illinois</ORGANIZATION>'s highest in three years. 

   As for the multistate plan, <ORGANIZATION>Sharon Sharp</ORGANIZATION>, who took over yesterday as <ORGANIZATION>Illinois</ORGANIZATION> lottery director, says she hasn't made up her mind about <ORGANIZATION>Illinois</ORGANIZATION> membership. 
If the answer is yes, <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> will be the site of the weekly multistate lottery drawing. 
If <ORGANIZATION>Illinois</ORGANIZATION> says no, the winning numbers will be picked in <LOCATION>Des Moines</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>.

   Racial Groups Diverge
   In Timing of First Births
                                                                                                       

</LP>
<TEXT>
   RACIAL differences in the timing of first births are
widening, two <ORGANIZATION>University of Pennsylvania</ORGANIZATION> demographers find.
   Drawing on birth and other records published since <DATE>1979</DATE>,
<PERSON>Renbao Chen</PERSON> and <PERSON>S. Philip Morgan</PERSON> determine that from <DATE>1980</DATE> to
<DATE>1987</DATE> white women under 30 years old continued an earlier
trend toward postponing their first birth, while white women
over 30 began showing slightly higher rates of first births
than over-30 women of earlier decades, clearly seeking to
catch up on postponed fertility. Nonwhite women -- blacks,
Asians and others -- also tended to have their first children
at somewhat later ages than nonwhite women in earlier years.
   But at every age from the teens on, blacks and other
nonwhites were far more likely to be having their first birth
than were white women of the same age. For example, in <DATE>1987</DATE> a
20-year-old nonwhite woman was almost twice as likely to have
her first child in the following year as was a 20-year-old
white woman, while a 25-year-old nonwhite woman was about 1
1/2 times more likely to be having her first child than her
white counterpart.
   The research also showed that nonwhite women now have far
lower rates of childlessness than white women. Historically,
blacks had far higher rates, due largely to health and other
involuntary factors. This situation started reversing in the
<DATE>1950s</DATE>, and the difference has grown greater as more white
women have forgone having children altogether. In <DATE>1987</DATE>, for
instance, a white woman born in <DATE>1954</DATE> was better than three
times more likely to be childless than a 33-year-old
nonwhite.
                                                                                                       

   Farm Belt Holds Onto
   Its Oldest Americans
                                                                                                       

   THE OLDEST old, those 85 or more, bulk largest in the Farm
Belt, <DATE>1990</DATE> census figures show.
   Not surprisingly, the largest numbers of 85-plus men and
women are found in the most populous states: <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>. In each of these, people 85 and over total well
into six figures.
   Looked at as a percentage of a state's population,
however, a much different picture emerges. In 14 states, the
85-and-older group accounts for <PERCENT>1.5%</PERCENT> or more of the total
population. Iowa leads with <PERCENT>2.0%</PERCENT>, closely followed by <LOCATION>South
Dakota</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION> with <PERCENT>1.9%</PERCENT>, <LOCATION>North Dakota</LOCATION> with <PERCENT>1.8%</PERCENT> and
<LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION> with <PERCENT>1.7%</PERCENT>.
   In nine other states, including <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Wisconsin</LOCATION>, the oldest old account for
<PERCENT>1.6%</PERCENT> or <PERCENT>1.5%</PERCENT> of the total. The other states in this category
are <LOCATION>East Coast</LOCATION>: <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Rhode Island</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION>. <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION>, by contrast, is at the bottom of the ranking,
with only <PERCENT>0.2%</PERCENT> of its population 85 or older.
   Much the same states rank at or near the top in the
percentage of total state population living in nursing homes.
The <LOCATION>Dakotas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Wisconsin</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Rhode Island</LOCATION> are the only states with
at least <PERCENT>1%</PERCENT> of their populations living in nursing homes.
Census Bureau specialist <PERSON>Cynthia Taeuber</PERSON> says most nursing
home residents are 85 or older.
   So why do the oldest old figure so heavily in these
states? <PERSON>Ms. Taeuber</PERSON> hypothesizes that in most of these states
younger adults move out to seek better job opportunities,
while the older natives stay and age in place, inevitably
constituting a larger share of the total. And with their
children moved away, many end up in nursing homes.
   Another census report says that the number of
centenarians, men and women 100 or older, more than doubled
between <DATE>1980</DATE> and <DATE>1990</DATE>, increasing to 35,808 from an estimated
14,000 to 16,000. (There was no precise count in <DATE>1980</DATE>.) More
than 28,000 of the 35,808 were women, and well over 29,000 of
the total were white.
                                                                                                       

   Golf Has More Players,
   Who Play More Often
                                                                                                       

   MORE PEOPLE are playing golf, and most are playing more
often, a recreation specialist reports.
   <PERSON>Rod Warnick</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>University of Massachusetts</ORGANIZATION> professor who
tracks leisure trends, calculates that the number of adult
golfers increased about <PERCENT>6%</PERCENT> a year in the <DATE>1980s</DATE> to 22.2
million, while the number of days played grew about <PERCENT>7%</PERCENT>
annually to 393.7 million. Moreover, he notes, the number of
"heavy" golfers, those playing 20 or more times a year, grew
even faster, more than doubling to 6.8 million, while the
number of days these avid golfers played increased about <PERCENT>8%</PERCENT>
annually to almost 300 million days.
   <PERSON>Mr. Warnick</PERSON> says the growth of leisure time, the
increasing numbers of retirees and the aging of the baby
boomers all contributed. He also finds that more women and
minorities have taken up the game -- a trend he sees as apt
to lead to further anti-discrimination suits against golf
clubs and courses that aren't fully integrated or given to
equal treatment.
                                                                                                       

   Odds and Ends
                                                                                                       

   MOBILE HOMES make up <PERCENT>7%</PERCENT> of the nation's housing inventory,
the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> reports. This is the fastest-growing type
of housing, up <PERCENT>60%</PERCENT> since <DATE>1980</DATE>. . . . Athletes who play hard
to win are more apt to get hurt than those who just play for
fun, <ORGANIZATION>University of Florida</ORGANIZATION> researchers find. They say those
who take a game too much to heart are more likely to put
themselves in a risky situation in an effort to come out
ahead. . . . Diseases and other causes of disability in women
65 and older will be the subject of a seven-year study by the
<ORGANIZATION>Johns Hopkins School of Medicine</ORGANIZATION> under a contract with the
government's <ORGANIZATION>National Institute on Aging</ORGANIZATION>. About two-thirds of
all disabled older people are female.

<HL> Justices Decide States Can Deny Benefits
To Women Leaving Jobs for Pregnancy

<DD> 01/22/87</DD>
<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO>

SUPREME COURT (SUP)
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT (JUS) </IN>
<DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> ruled unanimously that federal law permits states to deny unemployment compensation to women who give up their jobs because of pregnancy. 

   The high court upheld a <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION> law that denies unemployment benefits to all employees who leave work for reasons that aren't caused by the job itself. 
Under <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION> law, for example, layoffs or illness caused by a job would be considered work-related; pregnancy isn't viewed as a job-related reason for leaving. 

   By an 8-0 vote, the high court ruled that a federal law passed in <DATE>1976</DATE> says pregnant women can't be singled out for less-favorable treatment than other workers who seek jobless benefits. 
The law doesn't say pregnant women must be treated better, the court said in an opinion written by Justice <PERSON>Sandra O'Connor</PERSON>. 

   Estimates of the number of states with laws similar to <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION>'s vary. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> mentioned <LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Vermont</LOCATION>, while the lawyer for the woman challenging the <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION> law listed <LOCATION>Vermont</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>North Dakota</LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>District of Columbia</ORGANIZATION>. 

   The ruling involves different federal and state laws from <DATE>last week</DATE>'s 6-3 decision that states may require employers to give disability leave and to guarantee job reinstatement to pregnant women. 

   Last week's ruling said that federal civil rights law didn't bar the states from requiring that pregnant women be given disability leave, while the decision yesterday involves the federal unemployment law and whether it requires states to provide jobless benefits to pregnant women who leave work. 
The court yesterday made no mention at all of the decision last week. 

   Last week, the justices went out of their way to say that the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> law didn't really require preferential treatment for women; the law simply made women equal in the work place. 
In yesterday's ruling, however, the court said that interpreting federal law to require unemployment benefits for pregnant women would discriminate against other unemployed persons for whom benefits aren't required. 

   The lawsuit was filed by <PERSON>Linda Wimberly</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>J.C. Penney Co.</ORGANIZATION> cashier who took a leave of absence to have a baby in <DATE>1980</DATE>. 
<LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION> law doesn't require reinstatement, and when she wanted to return to work one month after her baby was born, the company said there was no job available. 
Her unemployment claim was rejected by the state, and the <ORGANIZATION>Missouri Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> upheld the denial of benefits. 

   The high court's ruling upheld the <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> administration's interpretation of the federal law. 

   Justice <PERSON>Harry Blackmun</PERSON> didn't participate in the case and gave no explanation. 

   Water-Pollution Suits
   The justices ruled 9-0 that a company that is located in one state and pollutes interstate waters can be sued in the courts of another state affected by the pollution. 
But the lawsuit must be decided based on the laws of the state from which the pollution came, rather than based on the affected state's law, the court said in a 5-4 vote. 

   The opinion written by Justice <PERSON>Lewis Powell</PERSON> said that applying one state's pollution laws to a polluting company in another state would interfere with federal water-pollution standards and enforcement. 

   The ruling came in a lawsuit filed by <LOCATION>Vermont</LOCATION> and some of its residents in state court in <LOCATION>Vermont</LOCATION>. 
The suit alleged that an <ORGANIZATION>International Paper Co.</ORGANIZATION> mill on the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> side of <LOCATION>Lake Champlain</LOCATION> was discharging waste into the lake, polluting interstate waters. 

   The <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> rejected the company's argument that only federal law should apply to the case, and rejected the state's claim that <LOCATION>Vermont</LOCATION> law should apply. 
As a result of the ruling, <LOCATION>Vermont</LOCATION> may continue the lawsuit, but <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> law will govern the case. 

   Justices <PERSON>William Brennan</PERSON>, <PERSON>Thurgood Marshall</PERSON>, <PERSON>Harry Blackmun</PERSON> and <PERSON>John Stevens</PERSON> agreed that some state lawsuits are allowed under the federal law, but disagreed that <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> law must be applied. 

   Annexing Voting Areas
   The justices ruled 6-3 that a city's refusal to annex a largely black neighborhood when it does annex a white neighborhood may violate the federal voting rights law. 
The court upheld a federal court's refusal to approve a proposed annexation by the city of <LOCATION>Pleasant Grove</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ala</LOCATION>. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Justice Department</ORGANIZATION> had also refused to approve the city's plan. 

   The voting rights law requires some cities and states to obtain the department's approval before making any changes that affect voting rights. 
The city argued that proposed annexations during the <DATE>1970s</DATE> of a white area and an unoccupied area that the city intended for white housing didn't change voting rights of minorities because the city had an all-white population at the time. 

   But the <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION>, giving broad meaning to the law, said the annexations of white areas could be seen as an effort to minimize the likely impact of future black voters, which is "as impermissible a purpose as the dilution of present black voting strength." 

   Justices <PERSON>Powell</PERSON>, <PERSON>O'Connor</PERSON> and Chief Justice <PERSON>William Rehnquist</PERSON> dissented.

<TEXT>
   Two centuries after the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> was
founded as a largely agricultural nation, nearly nine-tenths of the
population growth is occurring in metropolitan areas, the <ORGANIZATION>Census
Bureau</ORGANIZATION> reports.
   Almost half of all Americans reside in just 37 major urban
areas, the bureau said <DATE>Thursday</DATE> in a new analysis of the patterns
of growth. And the metropolitan share of the population is growing
faster than that in rural areas.
   The ``rural renaissance'' reported in the <DATE>1970s</DATE> when small towns
and rural areas were growing seems to have ended, with increases in
cities and suburbs now well in the lead.
   The census study found that about <PERCENT>86 percent</PERCENT> of the nation's
population growth since <DATE>1980</DATE> has occurred in the 282 officially
designated metropolitan areas across the country. That pattern
represents a return to the metropolitan area dominance that has
been common since the era of the <ORGANIZATION>Great Depression</ORGANIZATION>, the bureau
reported.
   The analysis of <DATE>1987</DATE> figures found that nearly half of all
Americans, <PERCENT>48.9 percent</PERCENT>, reside in the 37 metro areas with
populations of a million or more.
   Led by <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, these metro areas had 119
million residents in <DATE>1987</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>Bureau</ORGANIZATION> said.
   <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> leads the way as the only state entirely included
within metropolitan areas, the bureau noted. The northern portion
of the state is included in the greater <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> metro area while
the southern portion is part of the <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> region.
   Seven other states have more than <PERCENT>90 percent</PERCENT> of their
populations in metropolitan areas _ <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Maryland</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Rhode Island</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>.
   Idaho is the least metropolitan state with only about <PERCENT>20 percent</PERCENT>
of its residents in urban areas, the report added.
   Reflecting the nation's overall population trend, metropolitan
area growth has tended to flow to the South and <LOCATION>West</LOCATION> in recent
years, the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> observed in its study of growth patterns
between <DATE>1980</DATE> and <DATE>1987</DATE>.
   The population loss experienced in the <LOCATION>Northeast</LOCATION> during the
<DATE>1970s</DATE> has halted in this decade, the agency found, while the
<LOCATION>Midwest</LOCATION> has continued to have net losses in recent years.
   ``A slowdown in population growth has taken place since <DATE>1980</DATE> in
much of the interior of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, especially in
nonmetropolitan areas,'' noted the report prepared by <PERSON>Donald E.
Starsinic</PERSON> and <PERSON>Richard L. Forstall</PERSON>.
   During this decade the nonmetropolitan population declined in 10
contiguous states _ <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>North Dakota</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>South Dakota</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION>, the

   Two centuries after the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> was
founded as a largely agricultural nation, nearly nine-tenths of the
population growth is occurring in metropolitan areas, the <ORGANIZATION>Census
Bureau</ORGANIZATION> reports.
   Almost half of all Americans reside in just 37 major urban
areas, the bureau said <DATE>Thursday</DATE> in a new analysis of the patterns
of growth. And the metropolitan share of the population is growing
faster than that in rural areas.
   The ``rural renaissance'' reported in the <DATE>1970s</DATE> when small towns
and rural areas were growing seems to have ended, with increases in
cities and suburbs now well in the lead.
   The census study found that about <PERCENT>86 percent</PERCENT> of the nation's
population growth since <DATE>1980</DATE> has occurred in the 282 officially
designated metropolitan areas across the country. That pattern
represents a return to the metropolitan area dominance that has
been common since the era of the <ORGANIZATION>Great Depression</ORGANIZATION>, the bureau
reported.
   The analysis of <DATE>1987</DATE> figures found that nearly half of all
Americans, <PERCENT>48.9 percent</PERCENT>, reside in the 37 metro areas with
populations of a million or more.

<HEAD>Missouri Town Nuts About Albino Squirrels</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   They're nuts about white squirrels in
<LOCATION>Marionville</LOCATION>. Just ask the folks at the <ORGANIZATION>White Squirrel Furniture
Store</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>White Squirrel Car Wash</ORGANIZATION> or the <ORGANIZATION>White Squirrel Hollow Bed
&amp; Breakfast</ORGANIZATION>.
   And watch where you're driving: A 21-year-old city ordinance
imposes a <MONEY>$500</MONEY> fine for deliberately injuring or killing one of the
rare albino squirrels. Motorists must yield right of way to them.
   No one has ever been arrested for violating the law, but that
doesn't mean it's taken lightly.
   ``If I catch somebody killing a white squirrel, I will issue a
citation,'' said Police Chief <PERSON>Jesse Merritt</PERSON>, who wears a
squirrel-emblazoned shoulder patch on his uniform. ``It's no joke.''
   Some people even go so far as to trap the albinos' gray cousins
and banish them from the small southwest <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION> town to give the
white squirrels first crack at the nuts.
   <LOCATION>Marionville</LOCATION>, home to 2,000 people and nearly half that many white
squirrels, has a billboard welcoming visitors to the ``Home of the
White Squirrel.''
   Only one other community in the nation _ <LOCATION>Olney</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ill.</LOCATION> _ is known
to have a sizable concentration of the snow-white squirrels, but
<LOCATION>Marionville</LOCATION>'s colony is much larger, says <PERSON>James Smart</PERSON>, a local
authority and booster of the animal.
   ``We've blown <PERSON>Olney</PERSON> off the map,'' he boasts. Olney has a measly
few dozen squirrels, he figures.
   Wildlife experts say finding any albino animal colony the size of
<LOCATION>Marionville</LOCATION>'s is rare.
   ``Normally you see an albino show up occasionally in a population
such as squirrels or birds or deer, but entire populations are not
something you come across all that frequently,'' said <PERSON>Eric
Kurzejeski</PERSON>, a state wildlife research biologist.
   Signs of <LOCATION>Marionville</LOCATION>'s affection for the white squirrel, which
mates and otherwise interacts normally with its gray cousin, are
everywhere.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Lions Club</ORGANIZATION> sells white squirrel T-shirts and pins to raise
money to buy redwood boxes that are placed in trees as homes for the
squirrels. More than 500 dens have been put up, and volunteers have
planted hundreds of nut trees.
   ``We've had orders for T-shirts from <LOCATION>Kalamazoo</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mich.</LOCATION>, to <LOCATION>Los
Angeles</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Memphis</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION>,'' says <PERSON>Smart</PERSON>, a Lions
member. ``<LOCATION>Marionville</LOCATION> is a small town, but people who grew up here
and moved away still remember their roots and want to help the white
squirrel.''
   White squirrels first appeared in <LOCATION>Marionville</LOCATION> around <DATE>1860</DATE>, Smart
says. According to local legend, a couple of the critters escaped
from a traveling circus and began multiplying, or were the product
of a weird experiment by a local scientist.
   Smart became fascinated by white squirrels when one showed up on
the deck of his home about 12 years ago. He set out to increase the
population by trapping the more numerous gray squirrels in the woods
around his home and releasing them several miles away to provide
more room for the whites.
   ``We trapped 110 gray squirrels in a year and a half,'' he said.
``It was just amazing what the whites did then.''
   Smart estimates that about three dozen albino squirrels live in
30 den boxes and in trees on his heavily wooded property.
   ``I have one picture at home with 17 white squirrels in it,'' he
said.
   Retirees <PERSON>Johnie</PERSON> and <PERSON>Ann Clark</PERSON> spend hours on their back porch
watching the white squirrels munch corn and walnuts placed at their
feeders. The couple had no white squirrels until Smart transplanted
some there a few years ago.
   ``They'll play just like a little kitten,'' <PERSON>Mrs. Clark</PERSON> said.
``There will be five or six in the yard looking for something to eat
and I'll say, `Don't leave, <PERSON>Johnie</PERSON>'s bringing you something.' I
swear they can understand me.''
   <PERSON>Diana Wise</PERSON>, who runs the <ORGANIZATION>White Squirrel Hollow Bed &amp; Breakfast</ORGANIZATION>
with her husband, <PERSON>Clint</PERSON>, says people come for miles to see the
animals.
   ``A lot of people don't really believe we have white squirrels
because they stop at noon and don't see them,'' she said. ``The best
time to see them is 6:30 or 7 in the morning and around 7, <TIME>7:30 at
night</TIME> when they're feeding. They don't like the heat and I think the
light hurts their pink eyes.''
   Smart used to hunt gray squirrels (``Young squirrel, fried, with
biscuits and gravy _ you can't beat it''), but not anymore.
   ``The squirrels are a hobby, a challenge for me now,'' he says.
``I guess I'm paying back for all the hunting I used to do.''

   As President <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> follows Vice President
<PERSON>George Bush</PERSON> into <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION>, he is taking his campaign for the
Republican ticket to a state he carried narrowly in <DATE>1980</DATE> and
resoundingly four years ago.
   <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> was flying today to <LOCATION>Cape Girardeau</LOCATION>, a shipping center on
the <LOCATION>Mississippi River</LOCATION>, for a rally at <ORGANIZATION>Southeast Missouri State
University</ORGANIZATION>, and then on to <LOCATION>St. Louis</LOCATION> to address 1,000 guests at a
<MONEY>$250-a-plate</MONEY> fund-raising dinner.
   ``The general thrust of both of these speeches is support for
the Republican ticket, acknowledgement of the economic successes of
this administration, discussion of the differences between liberals
and conservatives,'' <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>Marlin Fitzwater</PERSON> said
<DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
   ``The first rally speech may focus a little more on the economy
and the second one a little more on military strength,'' the
spokesman said. ``But they will both be traditional political
speeches, covering the themes that the president has discussed in
the past.''
   The president plans one or two speaking forays each week until
the <DATE>Nov. 8</DATE> election.
   GOP candidates who will benefit from the <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION> events include
Gov. <PERSON>John Ashcroft</PERSON>, seeking a second term against <ORGANIZATION>Democratic State</ORGANIZATION>
Rep. <PERSON>Betty Hearnes</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Charleston</LOCATION>, the wife of former Gov. <PERSON>Warren
Hearnes</PERSON>; and <PERSON>Sen. John Danforth</PERSON>, opposed by State <PERSON>Sen. Jay Nixon</PERSON> of
<LOCATION>Hillsboro</LOCATION> as he seeks his third term.
   Both <PERSON>Ashcroft</PERSON> and <PERSON>Danforth</PERSON> enjoy comfortable leads in state
public opinion polls.
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>, speaking <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> in <LOCATION>Jefferson City</LOCATION>, the state capital,
pledged, ``We will never go back to the grain-embargo days of those
Democrats, <PERSON>Carter</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mondale</PERSON>, and who knows who else.''
   <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> took <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION>'s 11 electoral votes with <PERCENT>51 percent</PERCENT> of the
popular vote against then-President <PERSON>Carter</PERSON> in <DATE>1980</DATE> and swept the
state with <PERCENT>60 percent</PERCENT> of the popular vote against <PERSON>Walter Mondale</PERSON> in
<DATE>1984</DATE>.
   Records showed that the only incumbent president to visit <LOCATION>Cape
Girardeau</LOCATION> previously was <PERSON>William Howard Taft</PERSON> on <DATE>Oct. 26, 1902</DATE>.
<PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> will speak at the year-old Show Me Center.
   In <LOCATION>St. Louis</LOCATION>, the state's most populous city with a metropolitan
area population of more than 2 million, the president will speak at
the <ORGANIZATION>Omni Hotel St. Louis</ORGANIZATION> at an event for the <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION> GOP Victory
'88 fund.

   An increase in drug-related arrests and
stricter sentencing requirements have brought about a <PERCENT>7.4 percent</PERCENT>
hike in the number of inmates in federal and state prisons, but
prison capacity hasn't kept up, according to the <ORGANIZATION>Justice Department</ORGANIZATION>.
   At the end of <DATE>1988</DATE>, a record 627,402 men and women were
incarcerated nationwide, but the most optimistic estimate of prison
capacity said there was room for 566,898. While the prison
population was increasing by <PERCENT>7.4 percent</PERCENT>, the prison capacity was
increasing by just <PERCENT>5.5 percent</PERCENT>.
   ``The <DATE>1988</DATE> increase translates into a nationwide need for more
than 800 new prison bed spaces per week,'' said the report written
by <PERSON>Lawrence A. Greenfeld</PERSON>, corrections unit chief for the
department's <ORGANIZATION>Bureau of Justice Statistics</ORGANIZATION>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, announced that serious crimes nationwide
rose <PERCENT>3 percent</PERCENT> between <DATE>1987</DATE> and <DATE>1988</DATE>. The total number of violent
crimes reported to law enforcement agencies increased <PERCENT>5 percent</PERCENT>,
paced by a <PERCENT>7 percent</PERCENT> jump in aggravated assaults in the last year,
according to preliminary results of the <DATE>1988</DATE> Uniform Crime Report.
   The report said motor vehicle thefts increased <PERCENT>11 percent</PERCENT> from
last year.
   The <DATE>1988</DATE> crime index increased <PERCENT>4 percent</PERCENT> in the <LOCATION>Northeast</LOCATION> and
South but registered no change in the <LOCATION>Midwest</LOCATION>. The index _ the
total number of crimes reported to state and local authorities _
increased <PERCENT>3 percent</PERCENT> in the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION>.
   The report released <DATE>Sunday</DATE> said the 42,967 additional prisoners
in <DATE>1988</DATE> were about 3,500 more than the number added during <DATE>1987</DATE>.
There had been a <PERCENT>7.2 percent</PERCENT> hike in <DATE>1987</DATE> over the previous year.
   The report attributed the increases both to the heightened
likelihood that a serious offender will receive a prison sentence
and a <PERCENT>113 percent</PERCENT> increase in the number of adults arrested for
drug trafficking or manufacturing.
   And the <ORGANIZATION>Bureau of Prisons</ORGANIZATION> expects the increases to continue.
   ``Obviously, the increased efforts of law enforcement to combat
drug problems (will hike the population), as well as the new
sentencing guidelines under which inmates will be serving longer
sentences,'' said <PERSON>Greg Bogdan</PERSON>.
   The federal prison population, which stood at 49,928 at the end
of <DATE>1988</DATE>, a <PERCENT>3.4 percent</PERCENT> increase over the 48,300 at the <DATE>end of 1987</DATE>,
is expected to reach some 83,500 by <DATE>1995</DATE>, <PERSON>Bogdan</PERSON> said.
   The report said that nationwide, state prisons were operating at
<PERCENT>7 percent</PERCENT> to <PERCENT>23 percent</PERCENT> over capacity, while federal prisons were
estimated to be between <PERCENT>33 percent</PERCENT> and <PERCENT>72 percent</PERCENT> over capacity.
<PERSON>Bogdan</PERSON> said the federal prisons were operating at an average of <PERCENT>55
percent</PERCENT> over capacity.
   During <DATE>1988</DATE>, total state and federal prison capacities increased
by 28,000 to 31,000 beds, depending on how the various
jurisdictions rated capacities, the report found.
   The report, which calculated prison population based both on all
prisoners and on those sentenced to more than one year, called
``sentenced prisoners,'' found that since <DATE>1980</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>District of
Columbia</ORGANIZATION> and the federal prison system have more than doubled the
number of sentenced prisoners.
   <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New Hampshire</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> have
experienced a threefold increase since <DATE>1980</DATE>, when total prison
populations in those states were 29,725, to <DATE>1988</DATE> totals of 93,597.
   The states that have more than doubled the number of such
prisoners since <DATE>1980</DATE> were <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Delaware</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New Mexico</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>North Dakota</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION>.
   The incarceration rate, based on the number of people sentenced
to more than one year in prison, reached 244 per 100,000 residents
nationwide. In <DATE>1980</DATE>, the rate was 139 per 100,000.
   The Western states had the highest increase in total prisoners,
<PERCENT>11.5 percent</PERCENT>, while the <ORGANIZATION>Northeast</ORGANIZATION> had a <PERCENT>9.2 percent</PERCENT> increase, the
<LOCATION>Midwest</LOCATION> <PERCENT>8.6 percent</PERCENT>, and the <LOCATION>South</LOCATION> <PERCENT>4.7 percent</PERCENT>.
   The 10 states with the biggest percentage increase in total
prison population from <DATE>1987</DATE> to <DATE>1988</DATE> were <LOCATION>Rhode Island</LOCATION>, <PERCENT>33.5
percent</PERCENT>; <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION>, <PERCENT>24.7 percent</PERCENT>; <LOCATION>New Hampshire</LOCATION>, <PERCENT>17.5 percent</PERCENT>,
<LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>, <PERCENT>16.1 percent</PERCENT>; <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, <PERCENT>13.7 percent</PERCENT>; <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>, <PERCENT>11.1
percent</PERCENT>; <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION>, <PERCENT>10.8 percent</PERCENT>; <LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION>, <PERCENT>10.6 percent</PERCENT>; <LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION>,
<PERCENT>10.1 percent</PERCENT>, and <LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION>, <PERCENT>9.9 percent</PERCENT>.
   But the prison population actually declined in seven states, the
report found. The states with declines were <LOCATION>South Dakota</LOCATION>, down by
<PERCENT>10 percent</PERCENT>; <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, down <PERCENT>5.1 percent</PERCENT>; <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION>, down <PERCENT>2.3 percent</PERCENT>;
<LOCATION>Tennessee</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION>, down <PERCENT>1.7 percent</PERCENT>; <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION>, down <PERCENT>0.9
percent</PERCENT>, and <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION>, down <PERCENT>0.2 percent</PERCENT>.
   Although men in prison still vastly outnumber the women
incarcerated, the number of women inmates increased at a faster
rate during <DATE>1988</DATE>, <PERCENT>12.5 percent</PERCENT>, than the men, <PERCENT>7.1 percent</PERCENT>. The
number of women in state and federal prisons grew from 29,064 at
the <DATE>end of 1987</DATE> to 32,691 at the end of <DATE>1988</DATE>, while the number of
men in prison increased from 555,371 to 594,711.

Plan for a County's Survival:
First, Eliminate Some Towns
---
By <PERSON>Eugene Carlson</PERSON>
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal
09/15/87
WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)
   IMAGINE A LOCAL ELECTION where you are given the choice of dissolving your hometown. 
Wiping it clean off the map. 
A lot of voters in <LOCATION>St. Louis County</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mo.</LOCATION>, may face that decision next <DATE>spring</DATE> as part of an unusual experiment in government reorganization. 

   The audacious plan is being championed by <ORGANIZATION>St. Louis County Executive Gene McNary</ORGANIZATION>. 
For starters, he suggests completely redrawing the boundaries within <LOCATION>St. Louis County</LOCATION>, creating 21 municipalities where 90 exist now. 
<PERSON>Mr. McNary</PERSON> says streamlining the county's crazy-quilt geography, along with rejiggering the tax system, would bring efficiency to local government and improve the area's business climate. 

   It would also put a stop to a phenomenon that is making life miserable for <PERSON>Mr. McNary</PERSON> and a lot of other officials of counties in fast-growing metropolitan areas of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> 
This is the push by communities to gobble up valuable, tax-producing land through annexation or outright incorporation. 

   WHEN A CITY or a town reaches beyond its boundaries and snaps up a shopping center or an affluent housing development on county land, it improves its own tax base. 
The county, meanwhile, loses a chunk of real estate that was generating revenue for its own treasury. 

   The trend is strictly one-way. 
<PERSON>Mr. McNary</PERSON> and other metropolitan county executives seem powerless to stem the land grabs. 
They foresee a situation not many years hence when communities will have skimmed off all the valuable real estate, leaving counties in possession of a handful of isolated, unattractive parcels. 

   What to do? 
<PERSON>Mr. McNary</PERSON>'s plan at first glance looks like surrender. 
He proposes incorporating all of <LOCATION>St. Louis County</LOCATION>, wrapping every last chunk of county land into one or another community's boundaries. 
The county budget would be cut in half; it would turn over police and fire duties to the communities and worry only about regional matters, such as roads and economic development. 

   <LOCATION>St. Louis County</LOCATION>, 524 square miles and one million population, nestles between the <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION> rivers and the western limits of the city of <LOCATION>St. Louis</LOCATION>. 
It is largely developed, with a mix of wealthy and low-income neighborhoods, factories and parkland. 
About <PERCENT>40%</PERCENT> of the county's land is inside some municipality's boundaries. 
The rest of the area, most of it on the county's periphery at the farthest distance from downtown <LOCATION>St. Louis</LOCATION>, is unincorporated. 

   IT'S THE PROLIFERATION of cities and towns in the county that grates <PERSON>Mr. McNary</PERSON>'s sense of government efficiency. 
The 90 municipalities range from a robust community of over 50,000 population to glorified neighborhoods with fewer than 100 residents. 
That's the second-highest number of cities and towns of any county in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, the county says; only <LOCATION>Allegheny County</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pa.</LOCATION>, which includes <LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION> and environs, has more. 

   <PERSON>Mr. McNary</PERSON> totes up the numbers. 
"There are 530 elected officials, 43 fire departments and 70 police departments. 
There's something like 700 different taxing rates. 
It's ludicrous for people to be paying for that kind of inefficiency." 

   Continued piecemeal zoning and incorporation will leave the county in dire straits, the executive says. 
"We'll have 130 or 150 municipalities, and any time a company wants to come in, there'll be a neighborhood zoning board to make them dance through the hoops. 
That's not conducive to economic vitality. 

   <PERSON>Mr. McNary</PERSON> and his planning staff have produced a blueprint that radically alters this patchwork pattern. 
It shows 21 communities, nearly all with populations in the 25,000 to 75,000 range. 
That's large enough to provide a broad range of city services but not so big that citizens can't be heard. 

   The new cities would absorb smaller units and get some county land on the side. 
For example, the revamped city of <LOCATION>Normandy</LOCATION> would digest all or part of 26 municipalities. 

   THE VOTING PROCEDURE is complex. 
A signature-gathering campaign has assured county reorganization a place on the ballot. 
The actual plan will be drafted by a 15-member <ORGANIZATION>Board of Freeholders</ORGANIZATION>, a peculiar institution created by <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION>'s constitution to arbitrate conflict between the city and county of <LOCATION>St. Louis</LOCATION>. 
It could be <PERSON>Mr. McNary</PERSON>'s blueprint, or one substantially different. 

   Oddly, the freeholder procedure for county reorganization also requires approval by city of <LOCATION>St. Louis</LOCATION> voters. 
<PERSON>Mr. McNary</PERSON> says city officials have pledged not to sabotage reorganization, despite a nasty disagreement over the location of a new professional football stadium that is taking on the character of a blood feud. 

   Selling reorganization, particularly to county residents and elected officials of towns destined to disappear, won't be easy. 
"The strategy is to preserve the large municipalities and give them some of the unincorporated land they've been trying to annex anyway," says <PERSON>Mr. McNary</PERSON>. 
And the small communities? 
"They're proud of their independence, but with the loss of (federal) revenue sharing, they're about to go under anyway." 

   The county executive is reconciled to howls of pain. 
"The very small municipalities will get <PERCENT>50%</PERCENT> of the ink and make <PERCENT>50%</PERCENT> of the noise on radio and television," he says. 
But their numbers at the ballot box aren't large. 
The 25 smallest communities make up only <PERCENT>1%</PERCENT> of the county electorate. 
"We hope they'll be reasonable about finding a solution," <PERSON>Mr. McNary</PERSON> says, without much conviction.

   The <ORGANIZATION>Department of Transportation</ORGANIZATION> says the
government chose a ``reasonable'' route to transport damaged fuel
from the <LOCATION>Three Mile Island</LOCATION> nuclear plant to <LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION>, despite concerns
that the cargo crosses too many urban areas.
   The <ORGANIZATION>DOT</ORGANIZATION> said in a 47-page report this week that the <ORGANIZATION>Energy
Department</ORGANIZATION> made ``a reasonable choice when evaluated against the
multiple objective route selection criteria.''
   However, the report also said, ``During the course of planning
the shipping campaign, the <ORGANIZATION>Energy Department</ORGANIZATION> did not have
well-developed operational guidelines for route selection.''
   Population exposure was not a significant factor in picking the
route, the report said.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Energy Department</ORGANIZATION> is 3{ years into a program to haul 300,000
pounds of damaged, radioactive fuel by train from the crippled <ORGANIZATION>TMI</ORGANIZATION>
Unit 2 reactor in <LOCATION>Middletown</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pa.</LOCATION>, to an <LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION> laboratory 2,400
miles away.
   Along the way, the fuel passes through <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION>. At the lab, the
material is analyzed by <ORGANIZATION>EG&amp;G Idaho</ORGANIZATION>, an <ORGANIZATION>Energy Department</ORGANIZATION> contractor
hoping to learn more about the <DATE>1979</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>TMI</ORGANIZATION> incident, the nation's
worst commercial nuclear accident.
   Twenty trips, each taking about five days, have been completed
by the <ORGANIZATION>Conrail</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Union Pacific</ORGANIZATION> railroads. There are expected to
be two more, <ORGANIZATION>TMI</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON>Mary Wells</PERSON> said <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   The report noted that the <ORGANIZATION>Energy Department</ORGANIZATION> ``encountered
opposition to the route, which passes through several large cities
(<LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Indianapolis</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>St. Louis</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Kansas City</LOCATION>). Most
concerns were from the <LOCATION>St. Louis</LOCATION> area, and to a lesser extent,
<LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION> areas and by the states of <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>.''
   The fuel, along with metal debris, is contained in canisters
secured inside layered stainless steel and lead casks designed to
withstand accidents.
   Because of its confidence in the casks, the <ORGANIZATION>Energy Department</ORGANIZATION>
did not use population exposure as a major determining factor in
choosing the route, <ORGANIZATION>DOT</ORGANIZATION> said.
   ``Since the best quality track is usually found on lines
connecting and traversing large population centers, the <ORGANIZATION>Energy
Department</ORGANIZATION> is generally forced to choose between using higher
quality track and avoiding high population areas,'' the report said.
   The <ORGANIZATION>DOT</ORGANIZATION> study was prompted by a request from <PERSON>Sen. John Danforth</PERSON>,
<LOCATION>D-Mo.</LOCATION>, for an independent assessment of the route.
   While it found the safety risks acceptable, <ORGANIZATION>DOT</ORGANIZATION> said the public,
``influenced by the nature of the material, apparently perceives a
risk higher than that based on technical considerations.''
   However, <ORGANIZATION>DOT</ORGANIZATION> also said that <ORGANIZATION>Energy Department</ORGANIZATION> poorly documented
its route selection decisions and lacked proper guidelines.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Energy Department</ORGANIZATION> said in a news release that ``this lack of
documentation does not indicate non-compliance with regulations or
breach of public safety.''
   The shipments are part of the overall <MONEY>$1 billion</MONEY> cleanup of the
<ORGANIZATION>TMI</ORGANIZATION> reactor.

Alaska Learns What It's Like
To Register a Population Loss

<TEXT>
   ADD <LOCATION>ALASKA</LOCATION> to the short list of states losing population. 
The reason: a sharp increase in the number of residents moving out. 
In the early <DATE>1980s</DATE>, a healthy influx of newcomers, plus the highest natural population increase of any state (about six babies are born in <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION> for every person that dies), kept population moving up briskly. 
Between <DATE>1980</DATE> and <DATE>1986</DATE>, <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION>'s population rose <PERCENT>32%</PERCENT>, by far the fastest rate of increase of any state. 

   But as the state's oil-based economy softened, the traditional migration pattern reversed. 
<PERSON>Gregory Williams</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION>'s state demographer, estimates that in the 12 months ended in <DATE>July 1987</DATE>, up to 15,000 more people left <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION> than moved into the state. 
That was more than enough to offset the natural population increase of about 10,000 for the same period. 

   With <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION>'s unemployment rate close to <PERCENT>10%</PERCENT>, a lot of out-migrants have headed for <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Pacific Northwest</LOCATION>, where the job market is healthier. 
There is a plus side to this outflow: Sluicing out excess workers should bring the local labor supply into better balance and help stanch the state's population loss. 
"We're seeing signs that this (population drain) has begun to bottom out," says <PERSON>Mr. Williams</PERSON>. 

   Ten states either lost population or had no population gain in the 12 months ended in <DATE>July 1986</DATE>, the most recent estimates published by the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION>. 
They are: <LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>North Dakota</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>South Dakota</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION>.

   Nearly <PERCENT>70%</PERCENT> of the metro <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> companies questioned said they planned to add employees next year, from managers to production workers, and all but a few said finding these workers would be tough. 
Higher pay doesn't seem to help much. 
The companies are already paying an average <MONEY>$6.58</MONEY> an hour for entry-level workers. 
Only <PERCENT>11%</PERCENT> said they had anyone on the payroll making the <MONEY>$3.35</MONEY> an hour minimum wage. 

   Despite the labor crunch, only <PERCENT>7%</PERCENT> of the companies said they'd consider moving operations to an area with more abundant labor.

   LITTLE PHNOM PENH: <LOCATION>Long Beach</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, is now reputed to have the largest concentration of ethnic Cambodians outside <LOCATION>Southeast Asia</LOCATION>. 
No one has yet done a full-fledged head count, but <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>'s education department says there are 3,325 "English impaired" students in <LOCATION>Long Beach</LOCATION> schools whose first language is Khmer (the Cambodian national language), double the number of the next-highest school district. 

   Add to this figure Cambodian students fluent in English, factor in parents, toddlers and in-laws at home, plus other adults, and the Cambodian population in <LOCATION>Long Beach</LOCATION> could fall in the 25,000 to 40,000 range.

   NORTH DAKOTANS TRADITIONALLY VOTE in large numbers, but in the <DATE>November 1986</DATE> congressional elections, they beat every state in both registration (an amazing <PERCENT>95%</PERCENT> of the voting age population) and turnout at the polls (<PERCENT>73%</PERCENT>). 
A fiercely contested <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Senate</ORGANIZATION> race, in which Democrat Kent Conrad nosed out Republican incumbent <PERSON>Mark Andrews</PERSON>, helped fire the voters enthusiasm. 

   <LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Oregon</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>South Dakota</LOCATION> all had turnouts of more than <PERCENT>60%</PERCENT> of the voting-age populace in <DATE>1986</DATE>, according to a new voting behavior analysis from the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION>. 
The worst performer: <LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION>, where only one-third of potentially eligible voters cast ballots.

States Hoping to Hit Jackpot
With Big Combined Lottery

<TEXT>
   THE BIGGEST get-rich-quick scheme in the history of the <LOCATION>Republic</LOCATION>, a multistate lottery, is in the works. 
Just imagine. 
Citizens of <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Oregon</ORGANIZATION> and other states competing with each other every week for a single jackpot running as high as <MONEY>$80 million</MONEY>. 
Millions of citizens will buy tickets in this, the closest thing yet to a national lottery, and participating states will reap <MONEY>millions of dollars</MONEY> for worthy causes. 
All of this, lottery promoters say, is the next best thing to a sure bet. 

   Names for the gambling extravaganza are already being tossed around: <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s Game and The All-American Game are favorites. 
There is an organizing body, the <ORGANIZATION>Multistate Lotto Board</ORGANIZATION>, headed by <PERSON>Peter O'Connell</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Rhode Island</LOCATION>'s lottery director. 
<PERSON>Mr. O'Connell</PERSON> says the game will be running by fall. 

   Two hurdles remain. 
Many states need approval of their legislatures to participate. 
And enough states must sign on to make the enterprise worthwhile. 
Odds that each will occur appear good. 

   The idea for a nationwide multistate lottery germinated in the <LOCATION>Northeast</LOCATION>. 
Small states there have been restless under the existing lottery system, which operates on two basic principles. 
One: The size of a lottery jackpot is determined by the number of people buying tickets. 
Two: As jackpots get bigger, more and more people shell out money to play. 

   THIS PUTS STATES with small populations at a disadvantage. 
<LOCATION>Rhode Island</LOCATION>'s biggest-ever jackpot, <MONEY>$2.2 million</MONEY>, looks puny next to the grand prizes offered twice weekly in neighboring <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION> that routinely run <MONEY>$4 million</MONEY> or so. 

   <PERSON>Mr. O'Connell</PERSON> says <ORGANIZATION>Rhode Islanders</ORGANIZATION> regularly play the <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION> lotteries, siphoning off sales that would otherwise stay home. 
"People will chase a large jackpot," he says. 
When <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>'s lottery was nearing its record <MONEY>$41 million</MONEY> jackpot in <DATE>August 1985</DATE>, he adds, "people would get one person and fly him to <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> to buy tickets. 
They were abandoning the <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Rhode Island</LOCATION> lotteries and sending money to <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. 
That tells you something." 

   What it tells small states, <PERSON>Mr. O'Connell</PERSON> thinks, is that they should band together to keep the money at home. 
<LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New Hampshire</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Vermont</LOCATION> fought the attraction of the <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION> lottery by joining forces. 
<ORGANIZATION>Tristate Megabucks</ORGANIZATION>, the nation's only regional lottery, has delivered. 
The three states, with fewer than three million people, ran up a jackpot of <MONEY>$9.6 million</MONEY> last <DATE>June</DATE>. 

   <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> is Exhibit B. 
The 10 Canadian provinces conduct a combined lottery draw every <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> and <DATE>Saturday</DATE>. 
The four-year-old nationwide lotto game, run by the provinces themselves, is offered in addition to each province's own lottery. 

   FEWER PEOPLE now play the lotteries in their own provinces, but this is more than offset by huge sales for the nationwide game. 
"If the provincial games in <DATE>1982</DATE> were at 100, then they're at 80 now, but the total lottery volume is 220," says <PERSON>Guy Simonis</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>British Columbia Lottery Corp</ORGANIZATION>. 
Since the provinces run both games, they are money ahead. 

   Revenue this year in the Canadian interprovincial lottery should approach <MONEY>$2 billion</MONEY> (Canadian). 
"This in a country with the population of <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>," <PERSON>Mr. Simonis</PERSON> notes. 

   Small states aren't the only multistate boosters. 
<PERSON>John Quinn</PERSON>, director of the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> lottery, says it's smart tactics for his state to join. 
If surrounding states that traditionally offer smaller lottery prizes than <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> suddenly start offering a piece of the big-buck multistate jackpot, <LOCATION>New Yorkers</LOCATION> might start crossing state lines to play the multistate game. 
"I think we'd be losing some sales," <PERSON>Mr. Quinn</PERSON> says. 
But if <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>'s legislature gives the multistate concept a thumbs up, "there's no doubt in my mind our bottom line will improve." 

   HERE'S HOW the game will work: States will sell weekly multistate tickets in addition to their existing lottery games. 
The game will be a lotto format, players selecting six numbers from a predetermined field. 
Each state will administer its own multistate ticket sales. 
If no one has the exact numbers, the prize rolls over and continues to build. 
Organizers say they'll cap the jackpot at <MONEY>$80 million</MONEY>, with any extra being used to build the next grand prize. 

   The winning numbers will be drawn in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>, probably on <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>. 
States will contribute to the jackpot fund in proportion to the number of tickets they sell. 
If <ORGANIZATION>Oregon</ORGANIZATION> sells <PERCENT>5%</PERCENT> of a week's multistate lottery tickets, it kicks in <PERCENT>5%</PERCENT> of the jackpot total. 

   <PERSON>Michael Jones</PERSON>, a Chicago-based lottery consultant, says the key sections are mostly technical, such as how to ensure uniform payout rules and audit standards. 
Putting computer software and drawing equipment in place can be done quickly, he says. 

   The list of interested states has shifted in recent weeks. 
The hot prospects now are thought to include <LOCATION>Delaware</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New Hampshire</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Oregon</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Rhode Island</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>District of Columbia</ORGANIZATION>. 

   <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>, which claims to offer more lottery games than any state, is on the sidelines. 
"We might be adding one too many products," says lottery director <PERSON>Blair Gettig</PERSON>. 
"Right now, we don't see the advantage." 

   <PERSON>Mr. O'Connell</PERSON> of the lottery board doesn't mind the dissent. 
"I'd start with three states -- <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Rhode Island</LOCATION> -- but we expect more," he says. 
"Once we're up and running, it's only a matter of time before they'll all be trying to join."

   Census Bureau Adds 3.8 Million to Count
   But Critics Say Millions Remain Missing

   WASHINGTON -- The Census Bureau added 3.8 million more
people to its 1990 headcount, but critics continue to
complain that the bureau is missing millions more.
   The bureau said yesterday that its almost-final tally from
the 1990 census is 249,632,692 people, 10.2% more than the
1980 census found.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The addition of 3.8 million people to the preliminary
total released this <DATE>summer</DATE> reflects 2.9 million residents the
bureau missed the first time as well as the anticipated
922,819 military and other federal employees and dependents
overseas.
   Under the Constitution, the new headcount will result in a
shift of 19 seats in the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. House of Representatives</ORGANIZATION>.
   <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> is the big winner, adding seven seats to give
it 52 representatives, or nearly <PERCENT>12%</PERCENT> of all the seats in the
435-member <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> is the big loser. It will lose
three seats and end up with 31 seats after the <DATE>1992</DATE> election.
   The <DATE>1990</DATE> tally includes military and other federal workers
and dependents living overseas. The <DATE>1980</DATE> tally didn't.
Excluding those people, the resident population of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
grew by <PERCENT>9.8%</PERCENT> during the <DATE>1980s</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON>Barbara
Bryant</PERSON> said.
   The bureau may yet make additional adjustments to the
tally. Under terms of an out-of-court settlement of a lawsuit
brought by <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION> and others who argued that the
census disproportionately misses minorities, the <ORGANIZATION>Commerce
Department</ORGANIZATION> must decide by <DATE>July 15</DATE> whether to adjust the
tallies statistically to compensate for the undercount.
Commerce Undersecretary <PERSON>Michael Darby</PERSON> yesterday called the
<DATE>1990</DATE> census "full, fair and efficient."
   But congressional skepticism persists. "It's not a
question of whether we have counted everyone. The census
never does," said Rep. <PERSON>Thomas Sawyer</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>), chairman of
the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> census subcommittee. "The question is how close
they've come to the truth."
   <ORGANIZATION>New York State Attorney</ORGANIZATION> General <PERSON>Robert Abrams</PERSON>, among those
suing the bureau, was quick to complain that the <DATE>1990</DATE> census
still undercounted his state. "When large segments of our
residents are left out of the political process, democracy is
devalued for all of us," he said.
   Additions to the preliminary tally reflect, among other
things, recanvassing of a substantial number of housing units
by census enumerators. With aid from state and local
governments, the bureau also identified about 125,000 housing
units it had missed. It also turned up an extra 400,000
people from parole records, <PERSON>Mrs. Bryant</PERSON> said recently.
   <PERSON>Mr. Darby</PERSON> noted that the new tally is "surprisingly close"
to earlier projections that the census would find a
population of 250 million. But Rep. <PERSON>Sawyer</PERSON> noted that the
249.6 million total is still substantially shy of the
bureau's recent projections, based on demographic data, of
253.4 million.
   The <DATE>1990</DATE> census confirms trends identified in earlier
reports, such as the rapid growth of the western states. "The
West is the big population gainer," <PERSON>Mrs. Bryant</PERSON> said. In the
past decade, the population of the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION> has grown by <PERCENT>22%</PERCENT>,
while the South grew by <PERCENT>13.5%</PERCENT>, the Northeast by <PERCENT>3.4%</PERCENT>, and the
<LOCATION>Midwest</LOCATION> by <PERCENT>1.3%</PERCENT>.
   The reassignment of seats in the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> reflects these
trends, with the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION> and Sunbelt states gaining at the
expense of the big industrial states of the <LOCATION>Northeast</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Midwest</LOCATION>. In addition to <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, states adding seats
include <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, which gains four seats; <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, which gains
three seats; and <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION>
and <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, which each gain one seat.
   Besides <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, states losing seats include <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>, which each lose two seats;
and <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION>, which each lose one
seat.
   None of these shifts comes as a surprise, however. Earlier
bureau reports on the <DATE>1990</DATE> count pointed to all of them.
   The figures may provide new ammunition for the <ORGANIZATION>District of
Columbia</ORGANIZATION>'s perennially unsuccessful campaign for statehood.
Although the census found that the district lost population
during the <DATE>1980s</DATE>, it still is larger than either <LOCATION>Vermont</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION> or <LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION>. Yet the district hasn't any seats in the
<ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>, and its one representative in the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> can't vote.
   The bureau also noted yesterday that four states lost
population in the <DATE>1980s</DATE>. They are <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>North Dakota</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>West
Virginia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION>.

   Much of the GI generation that fought in World
War II and returned home to create an economic and baby boom is
retiring in relative comfort, a <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> researcher reports.
   More than half of retirees age 65 to 74 have income at double
the poverty level, and <PERCENT>12 percent</PERCENT> form an elite with income from at
least three sources, according to <PERSON>Charles F. Longino</PERSON> of the
<ORGANIZATION>University of Miami</ORGANIZATION>.
   But elderly affluence isn't spread evenly across the nation,
<PERSON>Longino</PERSON> reports in the <DATE>June</DATE> edition of American Demographics
magazine.
   ``There are a cluster of states with a large share of the
comfortably retired,'' <PERSON>Longino</PERSON> said in analyzing <DATE>1980</DATE> Census data,
the most recent information available with sufficient detail for
the study.
   <LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> had many of
the comfortably retired, while the pension elite made strong
showings in <LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Longino</PERSON> found.
   The poverty level for a family of four was <MONEY>$8,414</MONEY> in <DATE>1980</DATE>.
   The World War II GIs reaped the benefits of government programs
that provided educations and home loans, cost-of-living escalators
for their Social Security benefits and federal laws protecting
private pensions, <PERSON>Longino</PERSON> noted. In addition, many were able to
invest in stocks and bonds in a time of booming economy.
   Longino looked at three groups of retirees in his study, those
aged 55 to 64, 65-74 and 75 and over in <DATE>1980</DATE>. He termed them the GI
generation after the term ``Government Issue,'' which became a
popular for soldiers in the <DATE>1940s</DATE>.
   Just over half (<PERCENT>51.1 percent</PERCENT>) of those in the 65-74 age group
were listed as comfortable, and <PERCENT>12.3 percent</PERCENT> were in the elite
elite.''
   For the younger group, <PERCENT>59.1 percent</PERCENT> were comfortable and <PERCENT>4.7
percent</PERCENT> were in the elite. They were less likely to qualify as
elite since few were receiving Social Security in addition to other
retirement benefits.
   The oldest group listed <PERCENT>37.5 percent</PERCENT> as comfortable and <PERCENT>8.5
percent</PERCENT> as elite. Few in this group had income-generating assets
and most completed a large share of their working lives before
World War II, when pension benefits were less common and lower.
   Longino found the confortably retired of the 65-74 age group in
such resort and retirement states as <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New
Jersey</LOCATION>; in <LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION>, where many <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> executives have
retired, and <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>.
   <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION> has a large Asian population where extended families are
more common, a situation which boosts the household income measure
used as the basis for this calculation, <PERSON>Longino</PERSON> noted.
   For the pension elite, <LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> placed well,
as did <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Maryland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION>. Longino also noted that there
are clusters of affluent elderly in some metropolitan areas.
   He cited as examples <LOCATION>Fort Lauderdale</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Palm Beach</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla.</LOCATION>; <LOCATION>San
Diego</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Palm Springs</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>; and along the east coast of <LOCATION>Mobile
Bay</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ala</LOCATION>.
   Longino is director of the <ORGANIZATION>Center for Social Research</ORGANIZATION> in Aging
at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Miami</ORGANIZATION>, and his work was partially funded by
the <ORGANIZATION>American Association of Retired Persons</ORGANIZATION>. American Demographics,
published by <ORGANIZATION>Dow Jones &amp; Co</ORGANIZATION>. Inc., reports on population matters.
   Here is a state-by-state rundown of the percentage of Americans
aged 65-74 who are considered confortably retired, or among the
pension elite.
   Comfortably retired (CR) is defined as having income of twice
the poverty level. Pension elite (PE) means receiving from three
sources: Social Security, pensions and assets.

showings in <LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Longino</PERSON> found.
   The poverty level for a family of four was <MONEY>$8,414</MONEY> in <DATE>1980</DATE>.
   The World War II GIs reaped the benefits of government programs
that provided educations and home loans, cost-of-living escalators
for their Social Security benefits and federal laws protecting
private pensions, <PERSON>Longino</PERSON> noted. In addition, many were able to
invest in stocks and bonds in a time of booming economy.
   Longino looked at three groups of retirees in his study, those
aged 55 to 64, 65-74 and 75 and over in <DATE>1980</DATE>. He termed them the GI
generation after the term ``Government Issue,'' which became a
popular for soldiers in the <DATE>1940s</DATE>.
   Just over half (<PERCENT>51.1 percent</PERCENT>) of those in the 65-74 age group
were listed as comfortable, and <PERCENT>12.3 percent</PERCENT> were in the elite
elite.''
   For the younger group, <PERCENT>59.1 percent</PERCENT> were comfortable and <PERCENT>4.7
percent</PERCENT> were in the elite. They were less likely to qualify as
elite since few were receiving Social Security in addition to other
retirement benefits.
   The oldest group listed <PERCENT>37.5 percent</PERCENT> as comfortable and <PERCENT>8.5
percent</PERCENT> as elite. Few in this group had income-generating assets
and most completed a large share of their working lives before
World War II, when pension benefits were less common and lower.
   Longino found the confortably retired of the 65-74 age group in
such resort and retirement states as <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New
Jersey</LOCATION>; in <LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION>, where many <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> executives have
retired, and <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>.
   <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION> has a large Asian population where extended families are
more common, a situation which boosts the household income measure
used as the basis for this calculation, <PERSON>Longino</PERSON> noted.
   For the pension elite, <LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> placed well,
as did <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Maryland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION>. Longino also noted that there
are clusters of affluent elderly in some metropolitan areas.
   He cited as examples <LOCATION>Fort Lauderdale</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Palm Beach</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla.</LOCATION>; <LOCATION>San
Diego</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Palm Springs</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>; and along the east coast of <LOCATION>Mobile
Bay</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ala</LOCATION>.
   Longino is director of the <ORGANIZATION>Center for Social Research</ORGANIZATION> in Aging
at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Miami</ORGANIZATION>, and his work was partially funded by
the <ORGANIZATION>American Association of Retired Persons</ORGANIZATION>. American Demographics,
published by <ORGANIZATION>Dow Jones &amp; Co</ORGANIZATION>. Inc., reports on population matters.
   Here is a state-by-state rundown of the percentage of Americans
aged 65-74 who are considered confortably retired, or among the
pension elite.
   Comfortably retired (CR) is defined as having income of twice
the poverty level. Pension elite (PE) means receiving from three
sources: Social Security, pensions and assets.

<HEAD>Danforth Seeks Halt Of Rail Shipments of TMI Wastes</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Energy Secretary <PERSON>John Herrington</PERSON> was asked
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE> to halt rail shipments of radioactive waste from the
<LOCATION>Three Mile Island</LOCATION> nuclear plant until a new study can be made of
the route by which they are transported.
   Sen. <PERSON>John Danforth</PERSON>, <LOCATION>R-Mo.</LOCATION>, ranking minority member of the <ORGANIZATION>Senate
Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee</ORGANIZATION>, made the request in
the wake of an incident involving a <ORGANIZATION>TMI</ORGANIZATION> train in the <LOCATION>St. Louis</LOCATION> area
<DATE>earlier this month</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Herrington</PERSON> took the senator's request under consideration, a
<PERSON>Danforth</PERSON> aide said.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Federal Railroad Administration</ORGANIZATION> confirmed on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> it is
investigating a rail car switching incident on <DATE>Feb. 9</DATE> just before a
<ORGANIZATION>TMI</ORGANIZATION> train passed through <LOCATION>St. Louis</LOCATION>. The agency is determining
whether there were violations of rail regulations, which could draw
civil penalties of up to <MONEY>$10,000</MONEY>.
   The train was carrying casks of radioactive wastes from the
damaged <ORGANIZATION>TMI</ORGANIZATION> plant in <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> to a government laboratory in
<LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Bill Loftus</PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION>FRA</ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said the possible violations
involve mislabeling of a covered hopper car, which was added to the
<ORGANIZATION>TMI</ORGANIZATION> train in a railyard in <LOCATION>East St. Louis</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ill</LOCATION>.
   The car carried a placard stating that it contained a flammable
material, but later was found not to be carrying the dangerous
cargo.
   <PERSON>Loftus</PERSON> said the investigation is looking at possible violations
by the rail switching yard, the <ORGANIZATION>Union Pacific Railroad</ORGANIZATION> which
operated the train after it left the yard and a lime company that
was shipping the car.
   Federal rail regulations, <PERSON>Loftus</PERSON> said, require shippers to
properly label goods being moved by rail. Regulations also prohibit
switching yards from offering mislabeled cars for addition to a
train and railroads from transporting any improperly labeled
freight.
   Herrington met on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> with <PERSON>Danforth</PERSON> and several other
senators from states along the <ORGANIZATION>TMI</ORGANIZATION> rail route. The Missourian wants
the <ORGANIZATION>Energy Department</ORGANIZATION> to halt the waste shipments until the
<ORGANIZATION>Transportation Department</ORGANIZATION> can study the rail route used by the
<ORGANIZATION>Energy Department</ORGANIZATION> to move the materials to the laboratory in <LOCATION>Idaho
Falls</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION>.
   Since the shipments began in <DATE>1986</DATE>, <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION> officials have
complained that the government's route takes the radioactive
materials through densely populated cities such as <LOCATION>St. Louis</LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Study: When It Comes To The Pentagon, Most Districts Give More Than
They Get</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> costs most congressional
districts more in taxes than they get back through military
spending but the situation likely will change in the <DATE>1990s</DATE> because
of changing budget priorities, says an economist who studies the
effects of federal spending.
   ``These numbers should look quite different five or six years
from now,'' <PERSON>James R. Anderson</PERSON> said <DATE>Thursday</DATE> in releasing a study
that showed 321 of the 435 congressional districts lost money on
the deal.
   ``The patterns are fairly stable over a long period of time, but
I think we are going to see some very significant changes as we go
into the <DATE>'90</DATE>'s, in part because of base closings but also in part
as we level off and perhaps significantly reduce the military
budget,'' said <PERSON>Anderson</PERSON>, a professor of economics at <ORGANIZATION>Michigan State
Uniersity</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>Anderson</PERSON>, a senior fellow of <ORGANIZATION>Employment Research Associates</ORGANIZATION> of
<LOCATION>Lansing</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mich.</LOCATION>, an independent, non-profit economic consulting firm
that conducted the study, said the findings run counter to
arguments often heard on Capitol Hill.
   ``For years, members of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> would say that even if they
wanted to, they couldn't vote against military spending because it
meant money coming into their districts,'' <PERSON>Anderson</PERSON> said. ``But we
found that the <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> budget isn't a boon to most congressional
districts, it's a drain.''
   The study was based on <DATE>fiscal year 1987</DATE>, during which <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
military outlays came to <MONEY>$282 billion</MONEY>. An additional <MONEY>$7.1 billion</MONEY>
was spent on military categories of foreign aid.
   For the study, that <MONEY>$289.1 billion</MONEY> was apportioned among the
states and then divided among congressional districts by a formula
designed to take into account income levels as well as population.
   The <ORGANIZATION>North Central</ORGANIZATION> region of the country was the biggest loser,
with 97 of its 113 districts in the net loss category. In the
<ORGANIZATION>Northeast</ORGANIZATION>, there were 80 net loss districts and 15 gainers. The
South had 99 net loss districts and 43 that gained. The West was
the closest with 45 districts losing and 40 districts, heavily
concentrated in <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION>, gaining.
   The district with the biggest net gain from military spending,
more than <MONEY>$3 billion</MONEY>, was the 10th District of <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION>, home of
the <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION>. The biggest net loss, <MONEY>$1.2 billion</MONEY>, was in the <LOCATION>7th
District of Texas</LOCATION>, in <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Anderson</PERSON> said he included prime contracts, military salaries and
wages and retirement pay but not veterans' payments in calculating
defense expenditures and in his formula estimated that about <PERCENT>40
percent</PERCENT> of federal taxes go for federal expenditures. He said this
is higher than some other estimates, which run between 26 and <PERCENT>28
percent</PERCENT>, because he did not include trust funds dedicated to a
specific project in his total.
   The study said 104 districts registered a net loss of <MONEY>$500
million</MONEY> or more.
   Of these, 19 districts were in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, 13 in <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>, 11 in
<LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, eight each in <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>, seven each in <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION>, five in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, four in <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>, three each in
<LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Wisconsin</LOCATION>, two in <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION> and
one each in <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Oregon</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Tennessee</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION>.
   States registering an overall net gain were <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION>, <MONEY>$6.2

<LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION>, <MONEY>$9.4 billion</MONEY>; and <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> $<MONEY>1 billion</MONEY>.
   The most dramatic change was in <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, which went from a net
gain in a previous study in <DATE>1981</DATE> to a loss of <MONEY>$5.26 billion</MONEY>.
   Other losing states were <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION>, <MONEY>$612.8 million</MONEY>; <LOCATION>Delaware</LOCATION>,

<TEXT>
   LARGE public-school classes often reflect a lack of
funding, but nearly one-third of states have both
below-average spending and small classes.
   Estimates from the <ORGANIZATION>National Center for Education
Statistics</ORGANIZATION> based on the 1990-91 school year indicate that the
national pupil-teacher ratio for public elementary and
secondary schools was 17.2 to 1. The average expenditure per
pupil was <MONEY>$4,885</MONEY>.
   The estimated outlay per pupil was lowest in <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION>, at
<MONEY>$2,727</MONEY>. Utah also had the highest pupil-teacher ratio, at 25
to 1. Eleven other states, including <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION>, had both lower-than-average spending
per student and bigger-than-average class sizes.
   Small classes can mean higher costs. Spending per student
was greatest, at <MONEY>$8,161</MONEY>, in the <LOCATION>District of Columbia</LOCATION>, which
also had the second-lowest pupil-teacher ratio, 13.3 to 1.
Thirteen states, including all of the <LOCATION>Middle Atlantic</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New
England</LOCATION> states, had smaller-than-average classes and
above-average outlays per student.
   But 15 states, including <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, combine lower-than-average pupil-teacher ratios with
below-average spending per student. In some of these states,
including <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION>, the low expenditures
may stem partly from their low cost of living, in contrast to
the <LOCATION>Northeastern</LOCATION> states.
   Among the remaining states, <LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> have
average class sizes and above-average costs per student,
while <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Oregon</LOCATION> have both large classes and high
costs.
                                                                                                       

   Households Bring
   Most Bacon Home
                                                                                                       

   SPENDING on food prepared and eaten at home grew faster in
recent years than outlays on food away from home, reversing
the pattern of most of the '80s.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Bureau of Labor Statistics</ORGANIZATION> reports that spending in
the at-home category averaged <MONEY>$2,485</MONEY> a household in <DATE>1990</DATE>, up
<PERCENT>5.3%</PERCENT> from <DATE>1988</DATE>, while spending on food away from home rose
<PERCENT>1.7%</PERCENT> to <MONEY>$1,811</MONEY>.
   Many nutritionists recommend eating more vegetables and
grains and making animal flesh a side dish, but the nation's
diet still appears to center on meaty main dishes: The
biggest portion of at-home food spending, <MONEY>$668</MONEY>, went for
meat, poultry, fish and eggs.
   Fruits and vegetables were the second-leading category, at
<MONEY>$408</MONEY>; cereal and bakery goods third, at <MONEY>$368</MONEY>; and dairy
products fourth, at <MONEY>$295</MONEY>. Households also spent an average of
<MONEY>$84</MONEY> on various combinations of these main categories, as
found in canned, frozen and prepared foods.
   Basic foods need embellishment, however. <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> households
spent an average of <MONEY>$74</MONEY> on condiments and seasonings, and <MONEY>$68</MONEY>
on fats and oils.
   Then there are the real nonessentials. Spending on sugar
and sweets, including candy, gum and jam, averaged <MONEY>$94</MONEY> in
<DATE>1990</DATE>. Potato chips, nuts and other snacks accounted for <MONEY>$67</MONEY>.
Miscellaneous prepared foods, including baby food, accounted
for another <MONEY>$146</MONEY>.
   To wash everything down, households spent an average of
<MONEY>$213</MONEY> on beverages, including coffee, tea, soda and powdered
drinks. (Milk and juices are counted in the dairy and
fruit/vegetable categories.)
   Altogether, spending on food and beverages accounted for
<PERCENT>16%</PERCENT> of consumer spending in <DATE>1990</DATE>.
                                                                                                       

   <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Population Growth
   Picks Up After Census
                                                                                                       

   POPULATION growth has accelerated in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
   The nation's population rose <PERCENT>0.9%</PERCENT> annually in the <DATE>1980s</DATE>.
But recent <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> estimates show growth accelerated to
a <PERCENT>1.1%</PERCENT> annual rate between <DATE>April 1, 1990</DATE>, and <DATE>July 1, 1991</DATE>.
   Several states lost population in the 15 months following
the <DATE>1990</DATE> census, including <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New Hampshire</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>North Dakota</LOCATION>, as well as the <ORGANIZATION>District of Columbia</ORGANIZATION>. But <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>,
which lost population in the <DATE>1980s</DATE>, grew at a <PERCENT>0.5%</PERCENT> rate in
the latest period.
   Growth in some states has accelerated steadily. <LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION>'s
population rose an average of <PERCENT>3.3%</PERCENT> a year in the early <DATE>1980s</DATE>,
<PERCENT>4.9%</PERCENT> in the late <DATE>1980s</DATE> and at an estimated <PERCENT>5.3%</PERCENT> rate in the
1990-91 period. Growth has also risen steadily in the
<LOCATION>Carolinas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Delaware</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Oregon</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Tennessee</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Wisconsin</LOCATION>.
   Several Midwestern states whose populations fell in the
early <DATE>1980s</DATE> are now seeing growth, including <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>.
   On the other hand, growth has slowed in some states,
including <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION>.
<LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> grew at a yearly pace of <PERCENT>2.1%</PERCENT> in 1990-91, compared
with <PERCENT>2.9%</PERCENT> in the early <DATE>1980s</DATE> and <PERCENT>2.8%</PERCENT> in the late <DATE>1980s</DATE>. Even
so, it is currently the seventh fastest-growing state;
<LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION> ranks 10th.
                                                                                                       

   Odds and Ends
                                                                                                       

   THE FIRST employer-provided retirement plan in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
was set up by <ORGANIZATION>American Express</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1875</DATE>, says the <ORGANIZATION>Bureau of
Labor Statistics</ORGANIZATION>. It applied only to disabled elderly
employees with at least 20 years of service. In <DATE>1987</DATE>, the two
main types of private pensions numbered more than 872,000
plans covering 78 million workers. . . . Of the 13 largest
medical specialties, only pediatrics has shown a significant
increase in share of office visits in recent years. The
<ORGANIZATION>National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey</ORGANIZATION> shows that visits to
pediatricians accounted for <PERCENT>12.6%</PERCENT> of office visits made to
physicians in <DATE>1989</DATE>, up from <PERCENT>11.4%</PERCENT> in <DATE>1985</DATE>. . . . The share of
prescription-drug costs that consumers pay fell to <PERCENT>72%</PERCENT> in

<TEXT>
   President <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>, on a political trip
for his vice president <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON>, declared today that the
national economy is strong and ``what we have seen in the <DATE>last
eight years</DATE> is only the beginning.''
   ``We intend to ensure this kind of economic prosperity right
through the '90s and into the next century by guaranteeing the
federal government can never again spend and tax the American
people into another economic nightmare,'' <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> said.
   The president's remarks were prepared for delivery at a
Republican rally at <ORGANIZATION>Southeast Missouri State University</ORGANIZATION> in this
<LOCATION>Mississippi River</LOCATION> shipping center.
   He was to speak later in the day to an expected crowd of 1,000
at a <MONEY>$250-a-plate</MONEY> <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> fund-raising dinner in <LOCATION>St. Louis</LOCATION>.
   In his <ORGANIZATION>Cape Girardeau</ORGANIZATION> speech, <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> said children born <DATE>today</DATE>
``will know the brightest future the world has ever seen.''
   ``That bright future is also yours,'' he told his audience. ``It
is your birthright as Americans, and what we have seen in the <DATE>last
eight years</DATE> is only the beginning.''
   The national economy has been expanding for more than five years
following the steep recession that marked <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>'s first two years
in office.
   ``Ultimately, the choice before the American people is the
choice between two visions,'' he said. ``It is the choice between
the policies of liberalism or the policies of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s political
mainstream.''
   The president, a former Democrat, said that party's ``liberal
leadership ... has turned a once proud party of hope and
affirmation into one dominated by strident liberalism and
negativism.''
   ``The truth is that when you take a walk down our opposition's
memory lane, it starts to look like a `Nightmare on Elm Street.' If
you want to remember how things really were just a few years back,
think of the year <DATE>1979</DATE>,'' he said.
   ``In that one year, <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Nicaragua</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Grenada</LOCATION> were all lost.
That was the year <DATE>1979</DATE>. Don't we have the right to ask the American
people: If the liberals return to power, what happens in <DATE>1989</DATE>?''
   Spokesman <PERSON>Marlin Fitzwater</PERSON> said in advance of the trip that
<PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> would be giving ``traditional political speeches'' trying to
win support for the Republican ticket of <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> and <PERSON>Dan Quayle</PERSON>.
   The president plans one or two speaking forays each week until
the <DATE>Nov. 8</DATE> election.
   GOP candidates hoping to benefit from the <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION> events
include Gov. <PERSON>John Ashcroft</PERSON>, seeking a second term against
<ORGANIZATION>Democratic State</ORGANIZATION> Rep. <PERSON>Betty Hearnes</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Charleston</LOCATION>, who is the wife
of former Gov. <PERSON>Warren Hearnes</PERSON>, and <PERSON>Sen. John Danforth</PERSON>, opposed by
State <PERSON>Sen. Jay Nixon</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Hillsboro</LOCATION> as he seeks his third term.
   Both <PERSON>Ashcroft</PERSON> and <PERSON>Danforth</PERSON> enjoy comfortable leads in state
public opinion polls.
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>, speaking <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> in <LOCATION>Jefferson City</LOCATION>, the state capital,
pledged, ``We will never go back to the grain-embargo days of those
Democrats, <PERSON>Carter</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mondale</PERSON>, and who knows who else.''
   <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> took <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION>'s 11 electoral votes with <PERCENT>51 percent</PERCENT> of the
popular vote against then-President <PERSON>Carter</PERSON> in <DATE>1980</DATE> and swept the
state with <PERCENT>60 percent</PERCENT> of the popular vote against <PERSON>Walter Mondale</PERSON> in
<DATE>1984</DATE>.
   Records showed that the only incumbent president to visit <LOCATION>Cape
Girardeau</LOCATION> previously was <PERSON>William Howard Taft</PERSON> on <DATE>Oct. 26, 1902</DATE>.
   In <LOCATION>St. Louis</LOCATION>, the state's most populous city with a metropolitan
area population of more than <MONEY>2 million</MONEY>, the president was to speak
at an event for the <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION> GOP Victory '88 fund.

   A federal judge <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> sided with three
states and ordered the <ORGANIZATION>Army of Corps of Engineers</ORGANIZATION> to maintain water
levels at a huge <LOCATION>Missouri River</LOCATION> reservoir in order to protect the
states' fishing industry.
   <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> District <PERSON>Judge Patrick Conmy</PERSON>'s ruling regarding <ORGANIZATION>Lake Oahe</ORGANIZATION>
prompted shippers to begin moving barges off the <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION>'s
730-mile shipping channel to keep them from being marooned as the
river falls.
   The order will virtually halt navigation along the channel,
which runs from <LOCATION>Sioux City</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>, to <LOCATION>St. Louis</LOCATION>, said <PERSON>Chet Worm</PERSON>,
chief of the corps' reservoir regulation branch in <LOCATION>Omaha</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Neb</LOCATION>.
Officials warned that power shortages also could result.
   The ruling was in response to a request by <LOCATION>North Dakota</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>South
Dakota</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>.
   Those states' governors said the order could help end disputes
over management of the drought-hit <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION>, at 2,540 miles the
longest river in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>. But spokesmen for Govs. <PERSON>Terry
Branstad</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Kay Orr</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION>, two states downstream,
criticized it.
   ``The news is very alarming,'' said <PERSON>Orr</PERSON>'s legal counsel, <LOCATION>Bud
Cuca</LOCATION>.
   Downstream states rely on the river for water for drinking,
cooling power plants and sustaining fish and wildlife populations
of their own, officials said.
   Conmy ordered the <ORGANIZATION>Corps of Engineers</ORGANIZATION> to maintain the reservoir
at its current level until <DATE>June 1</DATE>, when the lake's walleyed pike
hatch will have ended. <LOCATION>South Dakota</LOCATION> officials contend the hatch
would have been destroyed had the corps been allowed to proceed
with plans to lower the level by 3 feet this month.
   Lake Oahe spans both <LOCATION>Dakotas</LOCATION> and has a storage capacity of 23.3
million acre-feet, or enough water to put 23.3 million acres under
1 foot of water.
   The governors of <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Dakotas</LOCATION> contend the corps is
sacrificing <MONEY>millions of dollars</MONEY>' worth of recreation and fishing
interests in their states to provide enough water for shipping.
   The corps filed notice it would appeal <ORGANIZATION>Conmy</ORGANIZATION>'s order, <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
Attorney <PERSON>Steve Easton</PERSON> said. But <LOCATION>South Dakota</LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON>George Mickelson</PERSON>
said the three states have already won.
   Even an expedited appeal is likely to take a few weeks,
<PERSON>Mickelson</PERSON> said. Before it is decided, ``we will have accomplished
most of what we set out to do,'' he said.
   ``There is justice after all, and this running battle has come
to a temporary halt, at least,'' <LOCATION>North Dakota</LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON>George Sinner</PERSON>
added. ``The water will stop flowing away from us, and we will stop
being washed down the river.''
   Attorneys for the corps argued the agency had balanced a number
of disparate needs in deciding how to manage the flow of water from
six upper <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION> dams.
   Sinner, <PERSON>Mickelson</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON>Stan Stephens</PERSON> said they
intended no long-term harm to states along the lower <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION>.
   ``My intention is to ... get them to sit down with us and
recognize the contemporary needs of all the states,'' <PERSON>Mickelson</PERSON>
said.
   Governors of the <LOCATION>Missouri Basin</LOCATION> states plan to discuss the
dispute next <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> in <LOCATION>Des Moines</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>, following a meeting by
the executive committee of the <ORGANIZATION>National Governors Association</ORGANIZATION>,
<PERSON>Branstad</PERSON> said.
   <PERSON>Charles Findlay</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Justice Department</ORGANIZATION> attorney representing the
corps, said it may have to reduce the <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION>'s flow through
<DATE>August</DATE> due to <ORGANIZATION>Conmy</ORGANIZATION>'s order, to avoid harming two rare birds that
nest near the river, the piping plover and the interior least tern.
   If that happens, electricity shortages could crop up downstream,
said <ORGANIZATION>Omaha Public Power District</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>Mark Gautier</PERSON>.
   Barge owners worried <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> that they might not be able to
get their vessels off the river in time.
   ``We've got five barges up above <LOCATION>Omaha</LOCATION> right now,'' said <PERSON>Roger
Blaske</PERSON>, co-owner of <ORGANIZATION>Blaske Marine Inc.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Alton</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ill</LOCATION>.
   Depending on how fast the river falls, the barges could be
stranded, <PERSON>Blaske</PERSON> said. ``I guess we'd just hang them up on a stump
somewhere and hope they're there next <DATE>fall</DATE>,'' he said.
   <LOCATION>Missouri River</LOCATION> marinas also could be put out of business as the
river drops an expected three feet as a result of the decision,
said <PERSON>John Ferrell</PERSON>, a corps spokesman in <LOCATION>Omaha</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Neb</LOCATION>.
   But Sinner, <PERSON>Mickelson</PERSON> and other officials say upper basin states
have suffered virtually all the impact of a lingering drought
entering its third year in the upper <LOCATION>Great Plains</LOCATION>.
   ``It's the worst drought in <DATE>this century</DATE>, and there's going to
be losers,'' said former <LOCATION>South Dakota</LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON>William Janklow</PERSON>, the
lead attorney in the three states' lawsuit.
   ``The point we make is there shouldn't be any winners,'' <PERSON>Janklow</PERSON>
said. ``We should all suffer together.''

   Over the past 20 years, a succession of presidents and
Congresses have voiced alarm over America's level of infant
mortality, and have authorized programs and policies to bring
it down. But the American infant mortality problem endures --
and by some measures, seems to be worsening.
   To be sure, the proportion of babies dying before their
first birthday has been declining in the U.S. Yet in relative
terms, America's pace of progress has been so slow that many
countries have surpassed us. According to the Department of
Health and Human Services, the U.S. infant mortality rate is
higher than those of 23 other industrialized countries and is
twice as high as that of Japan.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The latest initiative to revitalize progress against
infant mortality was unveiled last year by the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>
administration. Known as the <ORGANIZATION>Healthy Start Program</ORGANIZATION>, it
proposes to halve infant mortality over the next five years
in selected localities by "wrapping pregnant women and babies
in a blanket of care" fashioned from the "coordination of
federal, state, local, and private programs."
   Unfortunately, there is little reason to suppose that this
latest effort will be any more successful than its
predecessors. For almost a generation, in fact, <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>'s
infant mortality "strategy" has been a plan for battle in a
bygone world. By and large, our public health policies
presume that high infant mortality levels bespeak lack of
household income or medical services -- quantities a
government might supply. In modern <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>, however, material
poverty and inadequate health care are hardly the only
threats to infant survival -- and may not be the major ones.
   The economic data cannot explain why some poorer groups of
Americans have lower infant-mortality rates than some richer
groups. By the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION>'s most recent estimates, for
example, Asians and <ORGANIZATION>Pacific Islanders</ORGANIZATION> have a higher poverty
rate than <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> whites, yet their infant mortality rate,
according to the <ORGANIZATION>Centers for Disease Control</ORGANIZATION> (CDC), is
substantially lower. By the same token, infant mortality
rates for Hispanic Americans and non-Hispanic whites are
reportedly just about the same, even though the poverty rate
for Hispanic children is more than twice as high.
   Nor can economic factors account for differences in infant
mortality rates between <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> blacks and residents of <LOCATION>Puerto
Rico</LOCATION>. By a wide variety of measures, it is <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> blacks who
are more affluent. Their educational attainment is higher;
their unemployment rates are markedly lower; their per-capita
income is more than <PERCENT>50%</PERCENT> higher. But infant mortality in <DATE>1988</DATE>
was two-fifths higher for blacks than for babies born in
<LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION>. Clearly, traditional notions of poverty do not
explain what is happening in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> today.
   Inadequate medical care is another less than fully
satisfactory explanation for the problem. In Western
societies, the great majority of infant deaths occur within
days of birth; the lower the baby's birthweight, the greater
the risk. At any given high-risk birthweight, however,
perinatal survival chances in the <DATE>1980s</DATE> were substantially
better in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> than in <LOCATION>Norway</LOCATION> or <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> -- frontrunners in
the infant mortality race. This advantage showed up for
blacks as well as whites. Since medical intervention plays a
decisive role in the survival of low-birthweight babies,
these figures strongly suggest that <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> infant health
services on the whole are very good and broadly available to
those in need.
   America's infant mortality problem has less to do with the
survival chances of any low-birthweight baby than with the
unusually large numbers of infants born into high-risk
categories. Among blacks, the incidence of low birthweight
(defined as 5.5 pounds or less at delivery) is not only
higher than that of virtually any other Western population
but also twice as high as that of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> whites. Yet the
incidence among <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> whites is high as well -- nearly twice
that of <LOCATION>Norway</LOCATION>, for example. When one considers that infant
mortality rates are roughly 20 times higher for
low-birthweight babies than for those above 5.5 pounds, the
significance of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s disposition toward low birthweight
becomes deadly clear.
   Why does <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> produce so many low-birthweight babies?
The answer may have much to do with the behavior of
parents-to-be. Evidence suggests that the attitudes,
practices and life styles of many American parents --
including many who are neither poor nor poorly educated --
are exposing <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> babies to unfamiliar and unnecessary
hazards.
   A <DATE>1989</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION> study underscores this point. According to the
<ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION>'s survey of nearly 8,000 mothers, poorer white women had
the same incidence of low birthweight as more affluent ones.
On the other hand, white babies described as "unwanted or
mistimed" had a substantially greater risk of low birthweight
than those described as "wanted at conception."
   <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION> data show that one of the maternal characteristics
most strongly associated with low birthweight is
out-of-wedlock childbearing. Regardless of a mother's race or
age, her child is more likely to be low birthweight if
illegitimate. And regardless of a mother's race or age,
infant mortality is higher for out-of-wedlock births. (<ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION>
data tend to ignore the important role fathers play in
infants' well-being.)
   It has long been argued that the correspondence between
illegitimacy and higher infant mortality reflects only the
social disadvantages characteristic of unwed mothers. But
illegitimacy has been going "mainstream": Of the more than
one million babies born out of wedlock each year, more than
half are to white mothers, and more are to mothers 25 or
older than to teen-agers. More than a quarter of the white
single mothers in their early 30s now have at least some
college education.
   Other data from the <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION> are even more instructive.
According to an eight-state pilot study, infant mortality
rates were higher for unmarried mothers who were college
graduates than for married grade-school dropouts. This result
showed up for both whites and blacks.
   Why should this be? Part of the answer may be suggested by
new data from <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION> on risky behavior during pregnancy. In
this study of 60,000 births, there was a strong inverse
relation between a mother's years of schooling and her
propensity to smoke during pregnancy. Even so, unwed college
graduates, irrespective of race, were more likely to smoke
during pregnancy than the average married woman -- even
though that "average" woman had almost an even chance of
being a high school drop-out.
   Unwed mothers, of course, are not the only parents to
engage in practices prejudicial to infant health, nor are
nicotine and "tar" the only hazardous substances to which a
fetus can be exposed. Illegal drug use during pregnancy can
hurt a fetus, although data on the prevalence of such
practices are hard to come by. It is widely supposed that
such behavior is characteristic mainly of impoverished, inner
city, minority populations. But some recent data from <LOCATION>Rhode
Island</LOCATION> suggest otherwise.
   At two intervals in late <DATE>1989</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>Rhode Island Department
of Health</ORGANIZATION> tested women in labor for illicit drugs: cocaine,
marijuana, opiates, amphetamines. The sample was
representative of the state's entire population. Overall, <PERCENT>7
1/2%</PERCENT> of the mothers tested positive for one or more of these
drugs. Mothers who were black, young or poor were more likely
to test positive. But what is perhaps most alarming were the
rates reported for groups usually considered low risk. Fully
<PERCENT>7%</PERCENT> of the white mothers tested positive. Women 25 years of
age or older recorded a similar rate. And <PERCENT>6.6%</PERCENT> of the mothers
not classed as "poverty status" tested positive.
   Such behavior by mothers-to-be is all too characteristic
of the infant mortality problem in modern <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>. And
unfortunately, the traditional tools of social policy are not
easily applied against dangerous parental behavior. Despite
ever greater schooling for the population at large, the
proportion of babies receiving no prenatal care, or care
delayed until the last trimester of pregnancy, is slightly
higher today than it was in the mid-1970s. Education can be
highly effective when lack of knowledge is a constraint; it
fares less well when the problem is a lack of motivation.
   Key elements in the social policy and public health
communities appear determined not to confront this problem --
or even to acknowledge its existence.
   One may read the <ORGANIZATION>Ford Foundation</ORGANIZATION>'s "The Common Good," a
major <DATE>1989</DATE> study largely given over to recommendations on the
welfare and future of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s children, without once
encountering the notion of parental responsibility. The
<ORGANIZATION>Department of Health and Human Services</ORGANIZATION>' 700-page <DATE>1991</DATE> policy
document entitled "Healthy People 2000" manages to omit any
mention of the correlation between low birthweight and
illegitimacy. And in <DATE>1990</DATE>, a testy editorial note in the
<ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION>'s Morbidity and <ORGANIZATION>Mortality Weekly Review</ORGANIZATION>, a leading public
health periodical, scolded that "marital status confers
neither risks nor protection to the infant," even though the
<ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION>'s own data contradicted the assertion.
   Medical advances and increased health expenditures promise
the continuation of progress against <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> infant mortality.
Unless the problem of hazardous parental behavior is
controlled, however, the infant mortality rate is likely to
remain needlessly high. It may well be that our government
and legal system, which prize liberty, are not particularly
suited to enforce model behavior upon negligent
parents-to-be. But it is not too much to ask our leaders and
health specialists to speak plainly about what it is that
really ails our nation's babies.

<LEADPARA>  New York City grew by nearly 4 percent in the 1980s while other large cities
in the East and Midwest shrank during the decade, the Census Bureau said
Thursday.;    On the second day of a three-day roll-out of population counts
for more than 39,000 localities, the National League of Cities said that
three-fourths of the nation's municipal leaders believe the 1990 census was
inaccurate.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     These are the final numbers of the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION>'s national count.;    In
addition to releasing the numbers for <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> and many other cities, the
bureau released head counts for 16 states -- <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New Hampshire</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New

mayor, <PERSON>David Dinkins</PERSON>, first complimented the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION>'s work, then
reiterated the criticism he has leveled at the agency throughout the <DATE>1990</DATE>
count.;    "After much prodding, we are pleased that the bureau no longer is
headed in the wrong direction, is no longer statistically shrinking a city
which actually is growing," said <PERSON>Dinkins</PERSON>. "But even today's bureau report
falls short -- far short -- of the number of people who live in <LOCATION>New York
City</LOCATION>.";    <ORGANIZATION>The Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> said 7,322,564 people lived in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. That
number was higher by about 290,000 than a preliminary figure released <DATE>last

two other big cities on <DATE>Thursday</DATE>'s list showed sharp declines. <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION>
dropped <PERCENT>6 percent</PERCENT> to 1,585,577, and <LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION> plummeted <PERCENT>15 percent</PERCENT> to
1,027,974.;    <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>'s population, released <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, was 2,783,726, down
7.4 percent.;    Several other cities in the <LOCATION>East</LOCATION> also were big losers.;

nearly <PERCENT>13 percent</PERCENT> of its population, to 369,879. Cleveland slipped nearly <PERCENT>12
percent</PERCENT> to 505,616.;    Several small cities made big percentage gains --
<LOCATION>Boise</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION>, grew <PERCENT>23 percent</PERCENT>, to 125,738. Salem, <LOCATION>Ore.</LOCATION>, picked up <PERCENT>19 percent</PERCENT>
to 107,786, and <LOCATION>Huntsville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ala.</LOCATION>, gained nearly <PERCENT>12 percent</PERCENT> to 159,789.;    <ORGANIZATION>The
Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> has received heavy criticism from municipal officials who say
many of the poor weren't counted. They've sued in an attempt to force the
bureau to correct its numbers. The bureau will decide by midsummer whether to
do so.  </TEXT>

   Gobs of oil continued to wash ashore in
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>British Columbia</ORGANIZATION> two weeks after a spill from a
tugboat-tanker collision that one official said could scar the coast
for ``months if not years.''
   As experts assessed the ecological damage to the <LOCATION>Pacific
Northwest</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Shell Oil Co.</ORGANIZATION> estimated <DATE>Thursday</DATE> that a ruptured pipeline
in <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION> spilled 840,000 gallons of oil <DATE>Dec. 24</DATE> near a tributary
of the <LOCATION>Missouri River</LOCATION> in one of the biggest inland spills in <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
history.
   Shell has recovered about 441,000 gallons, company spokesman <PERSON>Tony
Canino</PERSON> said.
   The state of <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION> is ``probably headed for legal action''
against <ORGANIZATION>Shell</ORGANIZATION> for not notifying officials immediately after
discovering the rupture, a spokesman for the state <ORGANIZATION>Department of
Natural Resources</ORGANIZATION> said.
   In northwest <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, experts hiked along the shoreline of
<ORGANIZATION>Olympic National Park</ORGANIZATION> <DATE>Thursday</DATE> to assess damage to fragile
tidepools, kelp beds, rocky shores and wildlife from an estimated
231,000 gallons of bunker oil. The oil spilled after the <DATE>Dec. 22</DATE>
collision of a tugboat and a tanker in heavy seas two miles off
<LOCATION>Grays Harbor</LOCATION> on the central <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> coast.
   Olympic Chief <PERSON>Ranger Chuck Janda</PERSON> said a damage assessment should
be ready by <DATE>Saturday</DATE>.
   Evidence of the spill, which has washed up along 300 miles of
coast from <LOCATION>Newport</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ore.</LOCATION>, to <LOCATION>Vancouver Island</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>British Columbia</LOCATION>,
will remain ``a long, long time _ months if not years,'' he said.
   Tides and heavy surf appear to be gradually shifting the oil
northward, <PERSON>Janda</PERSON> said.
   State wildlife officials say about 3,700 sea birds have died in
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, with no estimates immediately available from <LOCATION>Oregon</LOCATION> or
<ORGANIZATION>British Columbia</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>Janda</PERSON> said contaminated birds still were being
found.
   Volunteers had cleaned 890 birds and released 42 by <DATE>late
Thursday</DATE>, said <PERSON>Susan Ewing</PERSON> of the state <ORGANIZATION>Department of Wildlife</ORGANIZATION>.
Among the species hardest hit have been murres, auklets, scoters,
loons and grebes, officials said.
   Many beaches along the rugged coast are accessible only by
helicopter or on foot at low tide. <PERSON>Janda</PERSON> said cleanup crews are
using choppers to haul out 20,000 pounds of oil-soaked sand, kelp,
driftwood and other material daily. The cleanup could continue for
several weeks, he said.
   At <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Pacific Rim National Park</LOCATION>, 100 miles to the north on
<LOCATION>Vancouver Island</LOCATION>, crews began preparing to remove blotches of oil
from 87 miles of beaches surrounding <ORGANIZATION>Barkley Sound</ORGANIZATION>. In some places,
the stench overpowered the smell of salt air.
   <ORGANIZATION>Sause Bros</ORGANIZATION>. Ocean Towing of <LOCATION>Coos Bay</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ore.</LOCATION>, owner of the barge
and tug, said the cost of cleanup in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> alone was <MONEY>$10,000</MONEY> a
day. The cost is covered by insurance, it said.
   Shell's 840,000-gallon estimate on the size of the <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION> spill
was the first the company has given. It would be on the scale of a
spill a year ago from an <ORGANIZATION>Ashland Oil Co.</ORGANIZATION> storage tank on the
<LOCATION>Monongahela River</LOCATION> near <LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION>, which federal officials said then
was among the nation's worst.
   Published estimates of the <LOCATION>Monongahela</LOCATION> spill have ranged from
500,000 to <MONEY>1 million gallons</MONEY>.
   The oil erupted from a 35-foot rupture in a buried pipeline near
the <LOCATION>Gasconade River</LOCATION>, about 140 miles west of <LOCATION>St. Louis</LOCATION>. Oil has
moved since into the <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION> rivers.
   Beginning today, <ORGANIZATION>Shell</ORGANIZATION> is increasing cleanup efforts on the
Gasconade and <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION> rivers, which will take ``at least two more
weeks,'' <PERSON>Canino</PERSON> said.
   Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION>Anheuser-Busch Cos.</ORGANIZATION> recalled some of the 2,000 workers
to its <LOCATION>St. Louis</LOCATION> brewery <DATE>Thursday</DATE> to begin a test run. Busch stopped
brewing beer <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> after tasters noticed an oily aroma to the
plant's water supply.
   The spill hasn't threatened drinking water.

   RETAILERS TAKE NOTE. Southeastern <LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Long Island</LOCATION> will continue to head the list of the nation's most affluent metropolitan areas at the beginning of the <DATE>1990s</DATE>, says <ORGANIZATION>Sales &amp; Marketing Management</ORGANIZATION> magazine. 
The magazine's annual Survey of Buying Power says Bridgeport-Stamford-Norwalk-Danbury, <LOCATION>Conn.</LOCATION>, will have an average household income in <DATE>1990</DATE> of <MONEY>$71,628</MONEY>, the highest of any <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> metro area. 
That's a <PERCENT>41%</PERCENT> increase over the <LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION> area's income level in <DATE>1985</DATE>. 

   No. 2 on the magazine's list is <LOCATION>Nassau-Suffolk</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>, the two counties that comprise <LOCATION>Long Island</LOCATION>, with estimated <DATE>1990</DATE> average income of <MONEY>$67,595</MONEY>. 
Third is <LOCATION>Lake County</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ill.</LOCATION>, near <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>, at <MONEY>$66,111</MONEY>. 

   Now brace yourself. 
The fourth most-affluent community on the magazine's list is in <LOCATION>North Dakota</LOCATION>. 
Grand Forks, <LOCATION>N.D.</LOCATION>, home of the <ORGANIZATION>University of North Dakota</ORGANIZATION>, a major <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> base, and some of the nation's richest farming country, will have average household income in <DATE>1990</DATE> of <MONEY>$63,231</MONEY>, according to the survey. 
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION>, is the magazine's projected No. 5 at <MONEY>$62,273</MONEY>. 

   Grand Forks residents are perplexed to learn they're so well off. (The magazine survey puts the area's <DATE>1985</DATE> average income at <MONEY>$41,988</MONEY>.) 
<PERSON>Bob Bushfield</PERSON>, Grand Forks planning director, says the <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> pumps in lots of money to support strategic bombers and missiles, and he notes that local farmers, with well-diversified crops, have largely escaped the agricultural recession. 
But he adds, "If you were to come out here, you wouldn't think we're going to be No. 4, I'll tell you that." 

   <PERSON>Robert Korvach</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>University of North Dakota</ORGANIZATION> economics professor, says the local economy is barely holding its own, with nothing in sight to justify a personal-income boom. 
"I have absolutely no faith in their methodology," he says of the income survey. 
The high rank for Grand Forks is "a statistical aberration." 

   Not so, replies <PERSON>Robert Katz</PERSON>, senior vice president for market statistics at <ORGANIZATION>Bill Communications Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, compiler of the metro income figures. 
He says the survey, which is widely quoted in the sales and marketing industries, uses Census, <ORGANIZATION>Internal Revenue Service</ORGANIZATION>, and state-government data to rank local areas. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Katz</PERSON> notes, for example, that a handful of wealthy people in a small population center such as Grand Forks can significantly push up the average income figure. 
Eliminate the wealth bias by using a median income figure -- the middle point among incomes of all households in the area -- and Grand Forks still doesn't look too shabby. 
Current median income there is <MONEY>$29,483</MONEY>, which puts the <LOCATION>North Dakota</LOCATION> town 31st among 317 <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> metro areas. 

   "We have a lot of consistent evidence indicating that Grand Forks is quite a wealthy area and will continue to be one based on trends we've seen for the past five years," <PERSON>Mr. Katz</PERSON> says.

   <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION>'S MIDWEST PLANT CLOSINGS may not hurt local government credit ratings after all. 
Since last <DATE>fall</DATE>, when <ORGANIZATION>General Motors Corp.</ORGANIZATION> announced the phased shutdown of nine assembly lines in <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Standard &amp; Poor's Corp.</ORGANIZATION> has been calculating the impact of the closings on the creditworthiness of the affected states, counties and cities. 

   "The impact isn't as severe as we anticipated it might be," says <PERSON>Peter D'Erchia</PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION>S&amp;P</ORGANIZATION> vice president. 
"At this point in our analysis, nobody is impacted severely enough to warrant a rating change." 
The relocation of certain jobs in the same area, and the fact that layoffs aren't coming all at once, make the closings somewhat easier for localities to swallow, he says. 

   A credit-rating downgrade translates into higher borrowing costs when a government raises money in the municipal bond market. 
In addition to the four states, <ORGANIZATION>S&amp;P</ORGANIZATION> has been looking at the bond ratings of <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>St. Louis</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Cincinnati</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION>, plus five other <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> localities, in connection with the <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> closings.

   WATCHING THE MOVING VANS is one way to get a feel for interstate migration. 
Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION>Allied Van Lines Inc.</ORGANIZATION> ranks state-by-state migration based on the company's 160,000 household moves nationwide. 
Last year, Allied counted 14 "magnet" states, its term for a state where <PERCENT>55%</PERCENT> or more of the company's residential moves are inbound. 

   The top magnet areas in <DATE>1986</DATE> were <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>District of Columbia</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Rhode Island</LOCATION>. 
Nearly three-fourths of Allied's <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION> business consisted of moves to the islands. 
Allied also counts states where there's a marked exodus. 
For the third year in a row, <LOCATION>North Dakota</LOCATION> had the highest percentage of Allied's outbound moves. 
Other states with a high share of outbound households were <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION>.

      Benefits of Moving Firm
   To Suburbs Narrowing
   ARE YOU WEARY of your company's downtown office site? 
Do you long for space in one of those glitzy suburban office parks? 
How about another city altogether? 

   Metropolitan Consulting Group, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, calculated the annual office costs for 10 major cities and their suburbs. 
The study's typical company has 300 workers in various pay scales, leases 60,000 square feet of space and serves a national market. 

   Rather than rely on commercial real-estate asking prices, the consultants analyzed several recent office deals in each location to pick up inducements offered by landlords. 
The figures also include taxes, utilities, and executive travel costs. 

   The suburbs are often better buys, says <PERSON>L. Clinton Hoch</PERSON>, Metropolitan's chairman, but the differentials are narrowing and soon may not offset the expense of moving. 
"If you're in downtown <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>, you can't justify moving out to the suburbs," he says.

   Study Shows Uncle Sam
   Favors New England</ORGANIZATION>
   STATES AND REGIONS are forever arguing whether the federal government plays geographic favorites when it comes to spreading around money. A new survey of government spending shows <LOCATION>New England</LOCATION> getting the biggest slice of the federal dollar pie and the Great Lakes states getting the smallest piece.
   The analysis, by the <ORGANIZATION>Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations</ORGANIZATION>, covers the range of federal largesse: government worker salaries, payments to defense contractors, grants to local governments for projects such as highways and sewers, farm subsidies and individual benefits, including Social Security, welfare, food stamps and Medicaid.
   The commission says that, on average, for every <MONEY>$1</MONEY> spent on these federal programs in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> in the <DATE>fiscal year ended Sept. 30, 1986</DATE>, <MONEY>$1.17</MONEY> was spent in the six <LOCATION>New England</LOCATION> states. In the mid-Atlantic states, the average was <MONEY>$1.10</MONEY>, largely on the strength of the government establishment in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C</LOCATION>. The Far West brought in an average of <MONEY>$1.10</MONEY>, the Great Plains <MONEY>$1.04</MONEY>, and the <ORGANIZATION>Rocky Mountains</ORGANIZATION> <MONEY>$1.01</MONEY>.
   Meanwhile, the Great Lakes states of <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Wisconsin</LOCATION> got just <MONEY>81 cents</MONEY>, compared with the <MONEY>$1</MONEY> national average. The Southeast received <MONEY>98 cents</MONEY>, and the <LOCATION>Southwest</LOCATION> got <MONEY>92 cents</MONEY>.
   States Team Up to Win
   Big in Lottery Returns
   MULTISTATE lotteries are catching the attention of state governments. When states join forces in a single lottery game, jackpots tend to soar, ticket-sales skyrocket, and state revenues increase.
   <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New Hampshire</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Vermont</LOCATION> already run a game called <ORGANIZATION>Tristate Megabucks</ORGANIZATION>. And making its debut this <DATE>Saturday</DATE> is <LOCATION>Lotto America</LOCATION>, a lottery linking <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Oregon</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Rhode Island</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>District of Columbia</ORGANIZATION> -- which have a combined population of 16.5 million.
   Players in <LOCATION>Pawtucket</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>R.I.</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Portland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ore.</LOCATION>, can buy a <MONEY>$1</MONEY> Lotto America ticket and compete for the same weekly grand prize, which starts at <MONEY>$2 million</MONEY> and goes up fast if no one wins. Drawings will be every <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> in <LOCATION>Des Moines</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>. Grand-prize odds are 18 million to one.
   Lotto America tried to sign up <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>, which would have produced even bigger jackpots. The two states flirted with joining, but both backed out when <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>'s legislature failed to give its permission.
   <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>'s lottery director, <PERSON>John Quinn</PERSON>, now says he's interested in setting up a rival multistate game with three other states: <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>. Their combined population of 49.2 million would produce the richest lottery jackpots in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> by far.
   <ORGANIZATION>Commerce Department</ORGANIZATION>
   And <LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION> Team Up
   <LOCATION>MINNESOTA</LOCATION> statistical buffs will have a field day with a 119-page volume just published by the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Commerce Department</ORGANIZATION>. The book, the first in a proposed series that would include every state, pulls together a wealth of economic, trade and census data about <LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION>. It sells for <MONEY>$12</MONEY> at the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Government Printing Office</ORGANIZATION>.
   The handbook is the first concrete payoff of the <LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION> Initiative -- an attempt to tailor some of the myriad services of the <ORGANIZATION>Commerce Department</ORGANIZATION>, such as weather forecasting, patents, tourism, export promotion, and economic statistics, to <LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION>'s specific needs.
   To improve the accuracy of weather forecasting along the Minnesota-Canada border, another joint project will funnel weather observations from three small northern <LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION> airfields into the <ORGANIZATION>National Weather Service</ORGANIZATION>'s meteorological data bank, starting this <DATE>summer</DATE>.
   The other projects include compiling a gross state product for <LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION>, building an international-trade computer model for a <LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION> industry, and creating a computer bulletin board that lists federal services.

<HEAD>Rhode Island Farmers No. 1 in Dollars per Acre</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> leads the nation in farm income,
but when the states are rated in terms of dollars earned per acre,
none comes close to <LOCATION>Rhode Island</LOCATION>.
   A new analysis by the <ORGANIZATION>Agriculture Department</ORGANIZATION> for <DATE>1987</DATE> earnings
said <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>'s net farm income was more than <MONEY>$5.58 billion</MONEY>.
<LOCATION>Rhode Island</LOCATION> was reported in 47th place at <MONEY>$46.4 million</MONEY>. <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION>
was at the bottom with <MONEY>$14.9 million</MONEY>.
   But the comprehensive <ORGANIZATION>Agricultural Income and Finance</ORGANIZATION> report,
which was issued this week by the department's <ORGANIZATION>Economic Research
Service</ORGANIZATION>, also ranked the 50 states according to average net farm
income per acre.
   <LOCATION>Rhode Island</LOCATION> was at the top, averaging <MONEY>$636</MONEY> per acre in <DATE>1987</DATE>.
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION> was seventh at <MONEY>$174</MONEY> per acre. And <LOCATION>Rhode Island</LOCATION>'s
per-acre average income was almost double second-place <LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION>,

<TEXT>
   Up to 40,000 anti-abortion demonstrators turned
out for a peaceful rally in downtown <LOCATION>St. Louis</LOCATION> on <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, police
said.
   Lt. <PERSON>Roy Miller</PERSON> said the demonstrators, who rallied at <ORGANIZATION>Kiener
Plaza</ORGANIZATION> after marching several blocks, gathered without incident and
no arrests were made.
   ``There were no physical confrontations,'' <PERSON>Miller</PERSON> said. ``Their
adversaries were giving a few catcalls and such but that's about
it.''
   Organizers called it the largest anti-abortion rally ever in <LOCATION>St.
Louis</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Miller</PERSON> said the crowd was estimated at 40,000, but several
police officers at the scene, as well as pro-choice supporters,
disagreed. They said only about 5,000 to 10,000 demonstrators were
on hand.
   The ``Show-Me Life'' rally came several weeks after the <ORGANIZATION>U.S.
Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> heard arguments in a <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION> abortion case which
could be used to overturn the landmark <PERSON>Roe vs. Wade</PERSON> decision that
legalized the procedure in <DATE>1973</DATE>.
   The court is expected to announce its decision this <DATE>summer</DATE> in
the case, <ORGANIZATION>Webster vs. Reproductive Health Services</ORGANIZATION>.
   The <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION> law at issue, passed in <DATE>1986</DATE>, declares that human
life begins at conception. It restricts abortion by banning the
procedure in publicly funded hospitals and by forbidding the use of
public funds.
   <PERSON>Loretto Wagner</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Missouri Citizens</LOCATION> for <ORGANIZATION>Life</ORGANIZATION> said rally
organizers hoped to impress the <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> with the number of
people who attended.
   ``This is a <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION> rally of proud Missourians hoping and
praying that the <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION> case will bring down the curtain on this
sad era in our country's history,'' she said.
   Among those addressing the crowd was <PERSON>Janet Ashcroft</PERSON>, the wife of
Republican Gov. <PERSON>John Ashcroft</PERSON>, and <PERSON>Sen. John Danforth</PERSON>, <LOCATION>R-Mo</LOCATION>.
<PERSON>Danforth</PERSON> said that if <PERSON>Roe vs. Wade</PERSON> was overturned, the power to
dictate abortion law would return to the state legislatures, and
ultimately to the voters.
   The rally was sponsored by <ORGANIZATION>Missouri Citizens for Life</ORGANIZATION>, along
with the <ORGANIZATION>Archdiocesan Pro-Life Committee</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Christian Action
Council</ORGANIZATION> and Clergy for Life.

   Population Drain Ends 

   For <LOCATION>Midwestern States 

   IOWA</LOCATION> IS MAKING a comeback. 
So are <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>. 
The population of all four states is on the upswing, according to new <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> estimates, following declines throughout the early <DATE>1980s</DATE>. 

   The gains, to be sure, are rather small. 
<LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>, for instance, saw its population grow by 11,000 people, or <PERCENT>0.4%</PERCENT>, between <DATE>1987</DATE> and <DATE>1988</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> says. 
Still, even that modest increase is good news for a state that hadn't grown at all since <DATE>1981</DATE>. 

   Between <DATE>1987</DATE> and <DATE>1988</DATE>, <LOCATION>North Dakota</LOCATION> was the only state in the <LOCATION>Midwest</LOCATION> to lose population, a loss of 4,000 people. 
Six of the 12 midwestern states have been growing steadily since <DATE>1980</DATE> -- <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>South Dakota</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Wisconsin</LOCATION>. 

   The <ORGANIZATION>Northeast</ORGANIZATION> has been holding its own in the population race. 
Seven of nine states have grown each year since <DATE>1980</DATE>, including <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, which lost <PERCENT>4%</PERCENT> of its population during the <DATE>1970s</DATE>. 
And although <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION> suffered slight declines earlier in the decade, they are growing again. 

   At the same time, several states in the <LOCATION>South and West</LOCATION> have had their own population turnaround. 
Seven states that grew in the early <DATE>1980s</DATE> are now losing population -- <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION>. 

   Overall, though, the South and West still outpace the <LOCATION>Northeast</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Midwest</LOCATION>, and fast-growing states like <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> ensure that the pattern will continue. 
But the growth gap between the Sun Belt and other regions has clearly started narrowing. 

   More Elderly Maintain 

   Their Independence 

   THANKS TO modern medicine, more couples are growing old together. 
And even after losing a spouse, more of the elderly are staying independent. 
A new <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> study of the noninstitutionalized population shows that <PERCENT>64%</PERCENT> of people aged 65 to 74 were living with a spouse in <DATE>1988</DATE>, up from <PERCENT>59%</PERCENT> in <DATE>1970</DATE>. 

   This doesn't mean they're less likely to live alone, however. 
That share has remained at about <PERCENT>24%</PERCENT> since <DATE>1970</DATE>. 
What has changed is that more of the young elderly are living with spouses rather than with other relatives, such as children. 
In <DATE>1988</DATE>, <PERCENT>10%</PERCENT> of those aged 65 to 74 lived with relatives other than spouses, down from <PERCENT>15%</PERCENT> in <DATE>1970</DATE>. 

   As people get even older, many become widowed. 
But even among those aged 75 and older, the share living with a spouse rose slightly, to <PERCENT>40%</PERCENT> in <DATE>1988</DATE> from <PERCENT>38%</PERCENT> in <DATE>1970</DATE>. 

   Like their younger counterparts, the older elderly are less likely to live with other relatives. 
Only <PERCENT>17%</PERCENT> of those aged 75 and older lived with relatives other than spouses in <DATE>1988</DATE>, down from <PERCENT>26%</PERCENT> in <DATE>1970</DATE>. 

   The likelihood of living alone beyond the age of 75 has increased to <PERCENT>40%</PERCENT> from <PERCENT>32%</PERCENT>. 
More people are remaining independent longer presumably because they are better off physically and financially. 

   Careers Count Most 

   For the Well-to-Do 

   MANY AFFLUENT people place personal success and money above family. 

   At least that's what a survey by <ORGANIZATION>Ernst &amp; Young</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Yankelovich</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Clancy</PERSON>, <PERSON>Shulman</PERSON> indicates. 
Two-thirds of respondents said they strongly felt the need to be successful in their jobs, while fewer than half said they strongly felt the need to spend more time with their families. 
Being successful in careers and spending the money they make are top priorities for this group. 

   Unlike most studies of the affluent market, this survey excluded the super-rich. 
Average household income for the sample was <MONEY>$194,000</MONEY>, and average net assets were reported as <MONEY>$775,000</MONEY>. 

   The goal was to learn about one of today's fastest-growing income groups, the upper-middle class. 
Although they represent only <PERCENT>2%</PERCENT> of the population, they control nearly one-third of discretionary income. 

   Across the board, these consumers value quality, buy what they like rather than just what they need, and appreciate products that are distinctive. 

   Despite their considerable incomes and assets, <PERCENT>40%</PERCENT> of the respondents in the study don't feel financially secure, and one-fourth don't feel that they have made it. 
Twenty percent don't even feel they are financially well off. 

   Many of the affluent aren't comfortable with themselves, either. 
About <PERCENT>40%</PERCENT> don't feel they're more able than others. 
While twothirds feel some guilt about being affluent, only <PERCENT>25%</PERCENT> give <MONEY>$2,500</MONEY> or more to charity each year. 

   Thirty-five percent attend religious services regularly; at the same time, <PERCENT>60%</PERCENT> feel that in life one sometimes has to compromise one's principles. 

   Odds and Ends 

   THE NUMBER of women and minorities who hold jobs in top management in the nation's largest banks has more than doubled since <DATE>1978</DATE>. 
The <ORGANIZATION>American Bankers Association</ORGANIZATION> says that women make up <PERCENT>47%</PERCENT> of officials and managers in the top 50 banks, up from <PERCENT>33%</PERCENT> in <DATE>1978</DATE>. 
The share of minorities in those positions has risen to <PERCENT>16%</PERCENT> from <PERCENT>12%</PERCENT>. . . . 
Per-capita personal income in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> grew faster than inflation last year, according to the <ORGANIZATION>Bureau of Economic Analysis</ORGANIZATION>. 
The amount of income divvied up for each man, woman and child was <MONEY>$16,489</MONEY> in <DATE>1988</DATE>, up <PERCENT>6.6%</PERCENT> from <MONEY>$15,472</MONEY> in <DATE>1987</DATE>. 
Per capita personal income ranged from <MONEY>$11,116</MONEY> in <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION> to <MONEY>$23,059</MONEY> in <LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION>. . . . 
There are 13.1 million students in college this <DATE>fall</DATE>, up <PERCENT>2%</PERCENT> from <DATE>1988</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>National Center for Education Statistics</ORGANIZATION> estimates. 
About <PERCENT>54%</PERCENT> are women, and <PERCENT>44%</PERCENT> are part-time students.

   U.S. Population Grew Less White in '80s
   As Hispanics, Asians Boosted Presence

   WASHINGTON -- The overall U.S. population became
significantly less white and Anglo-Saxon during the 1980s,
largely because of growth in the number of Hispanics and
Asians living in this country, according to the 1990 census.
   The proportion of U.S. residents identifying themselves as
white declined to 80.3% in 1990 from 83.1% in 1980. At the
same time, the proportion of Hispanics increased to 9% in
1990 from 6.4% in 1980. Roughly half of those who identified
themselves as Hispanic, the most rapidly growing minority
group, also identified themselves as white. Asians and
Pacific Islanders grew to 2.9% of the population from 1.5% 10
years ago.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In addition, blacks became a slightly larger segment of
the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> population, increasing to <PERCENT>12.1%</PERCENT> in <DATE>1990</DATE> from <PERCENT>11.7%</PERCENT>
in <DATE>1980</DATE>, and Native Americans grew to <PERCENT>0.8%</PERCENT> from <PERCENT>0.6%</PERCENT>.
Although still an overwhelming majority in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, whites
have shrunk as a proportion of the population from <PERCENT>90%</PERCENT> in
<DATE>1960</DATE>.
   Among Hispanics, the largest group remains people of
Mexican origin, followed by Puerto Ricans and Cubans. But the
census numbers suggest that a sizable migration of Central
and South Americans is under way. Between <DATE>1980</DATE> and <DATE>1990</DATE>, the
number of people identifying themselves as "other Hispanic,"
a group largely from <ORGANIZATION>Central</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>South America</LOCATION>, increased by
two-thirds. They now represent <PERCENT>2%</PERCENT> of the population.
   People of Chinese descent remain the largest element in
the growing <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> population of Asians and <LOCATION>Pacific Islanders</LOCATION>,
followed by those of Philippine and Japanese origins. In
addition, the census found significant growth among certain
groups from <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> -- especially the Hmong, who are from
mountainous regions of <LOCATION>Laos</LOCATION>, and people from <LOCATION>Bangladesh</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Sri Lanka</LOCATION>. Emigres from <LOCATION>Southeast Asia</LOCATION> and the
Asian subcontinent have been arriving in significant numbers,
but they don't yet represent a large portion of the overall
population.
   Minority groups remain unevenly distributed around the
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, with Asians and Hispanics concentrated in the West,
blacks and Cuban-Americans concentrated in the South, and
Puerto Ricans concentrated in the <LOCATION>Northeast</LOCATION>. More recent
arrivals, however, appear to be dispersed less predictably.
According to <PERSON>Jesus Garcia</PERSON>, a census statistician, growth in
the "other Hispanic" category was evenly divided among the
<ORGANIZATION>Northeast</ORGANIZATION>, the South and the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION>, though it was slower in
the <LOCATION>Midwest</LOCATION>.
   In addition, people of Mexican, Cuban or Puerto Rican
origin are more widely dispersed than in the past. The number
of people of <LOCATION>Puerto Rican</LOCATION> origin living in <LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION>, for example, more than doubled in the <DATE>last decade</DATE>.
   "When a group gets larger, it simply cannot concentrate
the way it used to," said <PERSON>Marty Riche</PERSON>, director of policy
studies for the nonprofit <ORGANIZATION>Population Reference Bureau</ORGANIZATION>.
   Among Asians, those of Hmong descent were most numerous in
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Wisconsin</LOCATION>, while those of Pakistani
descent were found principally in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>.

according to a federal study released <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.

among children ages 5 to 17, and that <PERCENT>49.9 percent</PERCENT> of these
children had no tooth decay at all.
   Officials said the sample population examined was selected to
represent the approximately 43 million school-aged children in the
nation.
   Dr. <PERSON>James P. Carlos</PERSON>, chief of the epidemiology at the <ORGANIZATION>NIDR</ORGANIZATION>, said
that dental decay, a problem that has plagued humankind throughout
history, has been steadily declining since the use of fluoride
became widespread and that the trend probably will continue.
   ``This disease, which is probably the most chronic disease of
childhood, is being decreased very fast,'' said <PERSON>Carlos</PERSON>. ``It is
declining 35 to <PERCENT>36 percent</PERCENT> <DATE>every seven years</DATE> and now half of the
children in the country have never even experienced dental decay.''
   Carlos said the decline in tooth decay follows a pattern
consistent with the increased use of fluoride in the nation's
drinking water, in toothpastes, and in mouth washes.
   He said the increased use of a dental sealant also has affected
the decline in tooth decay. The sealant is a plastic material that
dentists paint on the chewing surfaces to protect teeth from decay.
   For the survey, specialists counted the amount of decay or
fillings noted on each of the 128 surfaces of a typical set of 28
teeth in the school children. A missing tooth was counted as five
surfaces. Wisdom teeth were not counted since few school children
have them.
   The result showed that the statistical mean of tooth surfaces
with decay was 3.07 per child. The mean in a survey taken in <DATE>1980</DATE>
was 4.77, reflecting a <PERCENT>36 percent</PERCENT> decline in tooth cavities.
   In <DATE>1980</DATE>, the survey found that <PERCENT>36.6 percent</PERCENT> of the children were
free of tooth decay. This compares to almost half, <PERCENT>49.9 percent</PERCENT>,
found without decay in the recent survey.
   Carlos said no similar surveys were taken prior to the <DATE>1980</DATE>
finding, but experts estimate that the only <PERCENT>28 percent</PERCENT> of the
school children in the <DATE>1970s</DATE> were without tooth decay, and that a
generation earlier virtually every child experienced some tooth
decay between age 5 and 17.
   He said in the <DATE>1940s</DATE>, it was estimated that <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> school children
averaged seven teeth each that were decayed, missing or filled.
   Now, instead of counting teeth, he said, the survey must count
surfaces affected in order to get a meaningful statistic.
   Carlos said school children in the <LOCATION>Southwest</LOCATION>, which includes
<LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New Mexico</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION>, showed the least amount of
tooth decay with a mean of 2.4 tooth surfaces affected per child.
That region showed a mean of 3.4 in <DATE>1980</DATE>.
   The <LOCATION>New England</LOCATION> states _ <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New Hampshire</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Vermont</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Rhode Island</LOCATION> _ showed the highest
rate, with an mean of 3.6, compared to a mean of 6.1 in <DATE>1980</DATE>.
   Other regional findings, with the mean number of tooth surfaces
per child affected and the same mean from the <DATE>1980</DATE> survey in
parenthesis, are:
   Northeast (<LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pennsylania</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION>): 3.4 (5.4).
   Midwest (<LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wisconsin</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Illionis</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>): 2.9 (4.7).
   Southeast (<LOCATION>Maryland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Delaware</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>South
Carolina</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Tennessee</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION>): 3.1 (4.6).
   Pacific (<LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Oregon</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>): 3.4
(5.1).
   Northwest (<LOCATION>North Dakota</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>South Dakota</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION>): 2.8 (4.4).
   Carlos said the reason for the regional difference ``has never
been satisfactorily explained and is one of the enduring mysteries
of dental epidemiology.''
   At one time, he said experts thought that the varying amounts of
fluoride in the drinking water of the national regions accounted
for the differences, but that has now been discounted because
fluoride is presence in about <PERCENT>60 percent</PERCENT> of the water systems in
the nation.
   <PERSON>Dr. Preston A. Littleton Jr.</PERSON>, deputy director of NIDR, said the
decline in childhood dental decay will make it possible for the
agency to concentrate more of its research efforts toward dental
problems experienced among adults and older Americans.
   ``The results give us the opportunity to redeploy efforts and
attempt to make similar gains among the older population,'' said
<LOCATION>Littleton</LOCATION>.

   ``So, tell me about yourself,'' the <ORGANIZATION>Census
Bureau</ORGANIZATION> is about to ask Americans, a bit like an eager young man in
a singles bar.
   Both suitor and statistician think they already know some of the
answers. But, inevitably, both will hear things they didn't expect.
   ``There were some surprises in <DATE>1980</DATE> and we also expect some
surprises in <DATE>1990</DATE>,'' says <PERSON>William P. Butz</PERSON>, associate director of
the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``There are things we think are happening but, come the '90
census, we'll find that some of that is wrong,'' <PERSON>Butz</PERSON> acknowledges.
   What surprises are likely?
   With Census Day set for <DATE>April 1</DATE>, and months of effort to follow
in compiling and analyzing the numbers, <PERSON>Butz</PERSON> says simply, ``I don't
know yet.''
   While the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> takes a national head count only once
every 10 years, it is constantly taking sample surveys and has a
pretty good idea of what's going on with the nation's
quarter-billion people.
   The <DATE>1990</DATE> census will find not only a bigger population than in
<DATE>1980</DATE>, but one that is different in many ways. Americans are older,
live in different places, have a larger ethnic component and have
changed socially and economically in the last decade.

PERSISTENT DROUGHT PLAGUES MIDWEST FOR A SECOND YEAR

<P>
Drought and drought-related pestilence are threatening large portions of 
<LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s desiccated heartland, now in its peak growing season but still 
thirsting for relief from the drought of <DATE>1988</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
"Areas deficient in rainfall this year never quite recovered from last <DATE>summer</DATE>'s 
drought," said <PERSON>Ken Kunkel</PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION>Midwestern Climate Center</ORGANIZATION> at the 
<ORGANIZATION>University of Illinois</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
This year's drought is unlikely to approach either the geographic or economic 
scales of last year's, which was one of the costliest natural disasters in 
American history, driving up food prices and driving down important economic 
indicators. 
</P>
<P>
But the <DATE>1989</DATE> drought, building on last year's event, will affect tens of 
thousands of farmers and the economies of Midwestern states from <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION> to 
<LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION> and from <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>North Dakota</LOCATION>. Wide areas of the <ORGANIZATION>Southwest</ORGANIZATION> and West 
are also being affected by drought this <DATE>summer</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Here in northwestern <LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION>, swarming grasshoppers in numbers that have only 
been recorded in periods of severe drought are attacking fields of wheat, 
barley, sugar beets and oats. Soon they will move to the corn and soybeans. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm 60 years old, have been in this business 30 years and I've never seen them 
like this before," said <ORGANIZATION>University of Minnesota</ORGANIZATION> entomologist <PERSON>David Noetzel</PERSON>. 
"And the real tough part is still two weeks away for us." 
</P>
<P>
Noetzel has counted as many as 1,100 grasshoppers per square yard of ground, 
140 times what is considered normal. Farmers are routinely reporting 400 to 800 
grasshoppers per square yard, 50 to 100 times normal and the biggest 
infestations since the great Dust Bowl droughts a half-century ago. 
</P>
<P>
Damage from the grasshoppers is already estimated at <MONEY>$20 million</MONEY>, <ORGANIZATION>Noetzel</ORGANIZATION> said. 
</P>
<P>
In <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>, traditionally the nation's biggest producer of feed corn, fields are 
dry as the corn plants enter the critical grain producing phase of their life 
cycle. 
</P>
<P>
"We are short in topsoil moisture over <PERCENT>93%</PERCENT> of the state," <PERSON>Dale M. Cochran</PERSON>, 
<LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>'s agriculture secretary, said at week's end. And <PERCENT>99%</PERCENT> of the state's fields 
have virtually no subsoil moisture vital to sustain corn plants that normally 
reach a height of eight feet. 
</P>
<P>
In <LOCATION>North Dakota</LOCATION>, a major producer of <DATE>spring</DATE> wheat and sugar beets, Gov. <PERSON>George 
Sinner</PERSON> declared a drought disaster last week. <ORGANIZATION>North Dakota State University</ORGANIZATION> 
estimates this year's losses so far at <MONEY>$540 million</MONEY>, about half of what drought 
cost the state last year. 
</P>
<P>
Wells providing drinking water to more than 100 small towns in <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION> 
and <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION> have dried up, reported <PERSON>Donald A. Wilhite</PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION>University 
of Nebraska's Center for Agricultural Meteorology</ORGANIZATION> and Climatology. 
</P>
<P>
Drought in <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION> has not only made conditions ripe for wildfires but also is 
driving black bears from their rugged mountain homes into the populated 
foothills around <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dutch Elm Disease 
</P>
<P>
Botanists in the suburbs of <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> have reported the worst outbreak of deadly 
Dutch elm disease in 15 years as infected beetles prey on drought-weakened elm 
trees. 
</P>
<P>
Even farmers in <LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION> who used irrigation to escape the full thrust of <DATE>last 
summer</DATE>'s drought are being affected this year because, unlike <DATE>1988</DATE>, they began 
the <DATE>1989</DATE> growing season with fields that had virtually no stored moisture.

"Last year people in the state were saying, 'What drought?' " said <PERSON>Wilhite</PERSON>. 
"This year they had the driest <DATE>March</DATE> on record for much of <LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION>. In 
two-thirds of the state rainfall was only <PERCENT>50%</PERCENT> of normal. <DATE>April</DATE> was about the 
same. In <DATE>May</DATE> about half the state had only <PERCENT>10%</PERCENT> of its normal rain and much of 
the rest of the state had only <PERCENT>50%</PERCENT> of normal rainfall. Those three months were 
just devastating." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Winter Crop Losses 
</P>
<P>
Drought losses to the winter wheat crop in <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION> this <DATE>spring</DATE> are now estimated 
at close to <MONEY>$1 billion</MONEY> and may be larger when the harvest is completed in the 
next 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> is already at work on disaster legislation to help farmers hurt both 
by drought and by floods that affected farms in the <LOCATION>East</LOCATION>, South and Southeast. 
Last year farmers received close to <MONEY>$3 billion</MONEY> in government drought aid. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Insecticide Legislation 
</P>
<P>
The <LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION> Legislature -- aware that grasshoppers thrive in drought because 
it eliminates the moisture-fed diseases and fungus that control them -- this 
year approved a controversial law requiring farmers to control locusts. If they 
refuse, local governments have the power to spray insecticides and to add the 
cost of spraying to a farmer's annual tax bill. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation was opposed by environmentalists who claimed spraying could 
harm wildlife and other beneficial insects, such as bees. Organic farmers, who 
use no chemicals on their crops, opposed it -- as did farmers who have agreed 
to take their land out of production for 10 years in exchange for a relatively 
small annual payment from the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Harsh Words' 
</P>
<P>
Clashes have erupted between farmers who want the bugs sprayed and those 
opposed to the spraying. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been no violence, just a lot of harsh words," said <PERSON>Paul Anderson</PERSON>, a 
farmer in <LOCATION>Warren</LOCATION>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION>Marshall Township</ORGANIZATION> board and the township 
clerk. "It gets to be neighbor against neighbor. Usually it takes (a conflict 
over) water to create this kind of problem." 
</P>
<P>
"Most farmers want to spray," said <PERSON>Eldor Omdahl</PERSON>, 79, a retired farmer who has 
refused to spray. <PERSON>Omdahl</PERSON> donated 640 acres of his land in nearby <LOCATION>Polk County</LOCATION> to 
the <ORGANIZATION>Audubon Society</ORGANIZATION> for a bird and wildlife sanctuary, and spraying, he said, 
threatens the animals and birds. The remainder of his land is in the government 
reserve program and has no crops on it. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a lot of tension there. We don't know who will make the first move," 
said <PERSON>Omdahl</PERSON>, standing near his garden that has been largely eaten by 
grasshoppers. "They wanted my brother to spray and he ordered them off his 
land. It's a destructive situation. You have township officials administering 
the law and they are all biased farmers. . . . We didn't know anything about 
the law until the grasshoppers came. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a cost issue with me," <PERSON>Omdahl</PERSON> added. "One of the reasons I put it in the 
(federal reserve) is for the money. But I like to protect wildlife. That's why 
I gave it to Audubon."

<HEAD>Study Details Who Seeks Abortions</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Hispanic and black women, women with low
incomes, those living with someone they are not married to, and
those in school are statistically more likely to undergo abortions
than women in general, according to a private survey.
   Firm statistics are not available on the number of abortions
performed each year nor on who has them. Moreover, the survey by
<ORGANIZATION>The Alan Guttmacher Institute</ORGANIZATION> confirms that most abortions are
performed on white, middle-class women because they make up the
bulk of the population of women of childbearing age.
   However, the extensive survey by the New York-based, non-profit
group that studies reproductive issues suggests that women in
various categories have a statistically disproportionate share of
abortions relative to their raw numbers.
   For example, it found that nonwhite women make up <PERCENT>16.7 percent</PERCENT>
of the childbearing-age population, but accounted for <PERCENT>31.4 percent</PERCENT>
of the abortions.
   White women accounted for <PERCENT>68.6 percent</PERCENT> of those seeking
abortions, but <PERCENT>83.3 percent</PERCENT> of the childbearing-age population,
considered 15-to-44 for purposes of the survey.
   And it found that women with family incomes below <MONEY>$11,000</MONEY>
accounted for <PERCENT>33.1 percent</PERCENT> of those receiving abortions although
they made up only <PERCENT>29.2 percent</PERCENT> of all women of childbearing age.
   The federal <ORGANIZATION>Centers for Disease Control</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> estimates
there were 1,328,000 abortions in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> in <DATE>1985</DATE>, the
most recent year for which it has numbers. The <ORGANIZATION>Guttmacher Institute</ORGANIZATION>
estimates 1,588,550 that year.
   No one questions that the number has increased since the <ORGANIZATION>Supreme
Court</ORGANIZATION> legalized abortion in <DATE>1973</DATE>. The court is hearing arguments
<DATE>April 26</DATE> in a <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION> case that both sides agree could result in
the reversal, or weakening of that landmark <PERSON>Roe vs. Wade</PERSON> decision.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Guttmacher Institute</ORGANIZATION> surveyed 9,480 women who obtained
abortions at hospitals, clinics or doctors offices during <DATE>1987</DATE> in
an effort to find out who was obtaining the services.
   It selected 103 facilities in what was intended as a
statistically valid national sample base _ 21 hospitals and 82
clinics and physicians' offices _ and arranged for questionnaires
to be given to the 11,313 women who showed up for abortions during
a 12-day period.
   Although filling out and mailing in the questionnaire was
voluntary and done anonymously and privately by the woman, a large
number _ 9,480 _ returned completed questionnaires.
   Although no specific margin of error was given, the large sample
base lends credibility to the statistical profile of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> women
seeking abortions during that particular period in <DATE>1987</DATE>.
   Unmarried women living with a man constituted <PERCENT>17.4 percent</PERCENT> of
the abortion clients although they made up only 3.4 of all
childbearing-age women.
   Women attending school constituted <PERCENT>31.1 percent</PERCENT> of those seeking
abortions, but <PERCENT>20.5 percent</PERCENT> of all women of childbearing age.
   Most women cited more than one factor in their decision to have
an abortion. Among the reasons were concerns about how motherhood
would change their lives, financial problems, single parenthood,
the responsibility of parenthood, others knowing they were
pregnant, maturity and how many children they already had.

<LEADPARA>  WHILE public attention has recently been riveted on the emergence of democracy
in the Soviet Union, scant notice has been paid to the deterioration of
representation in the local scene. San Jose has outgrown its 10-district
system, and few decision makers seem to be concerned about the impoverishment
of our local democratic process.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  HOW S.J. CAN FEED DEMOCRACY: CREATE MORE COUNCIL
DISTRICTS  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Peter J. Haas is associate professor of political science at San Jose State
University. He served as a member of the Redistricting Review Panel.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Unless steps are taken to create more council districts in <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION>, the
gulf between residents and their council representatives will continue to
widen.;   Most of the debate about redistricting has centered on whether and
how to shape districts with majorities of racial and ethnic minority voters.
However, in a final report that fell by the wayside, the city's <ORGANIZATION>Redistricting
Review Panel</ORGANIZATION> recommended that the council study the creation of additional
districts.;   Although the very thought of creating districts reportedly
produced a chuckle among the council at a recent meeting, it is an idea whose
time has come.;   Since district-based representation began in <DATE>1980</DATE>, the city
has grown by nearly 200,000 people, while the number of districts has remained
frozen at 10. After the next election, each council member will represent
nearly 80,000 people. (The exact number is unknown because of the presumed
census undercount.) Thus, the number of residents each member represents has
increased about 20,000.;   Far too many constituents;   Eighty thousand people
is an incredibly large number for an individual to represent. Many state
legislatures have much lower ratios. To be precise, 41 state lower houses
(analogous to the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> Assembly) and 22 state senates have lower ratios
of representation than will the city of <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION> in <DATE>1992</DATE>. These include
populous states like <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Missouri.</LOCATION>;   <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION>
also compares poorly with many cities. Each council member in <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION>
represents more individuals than make up the entire population of many other
localities in <LOCATION>Santa Clara County</LOCATION>. Nationally, 18 cities with populations
between 400,000 and 1 million have an average representation ratio of 60,000
people per representative. Of these cities, only five (<LOCATION>Honolulu</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>San Antonio</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Phoenix</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION>) have larger ratios than <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION>, while the
remaining 13 have significantly lower ratios. These cities are <LOCATION>Long Beach</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fort Worth</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kansas City</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Oklahoma City</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Austin</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Seattle</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Milwaukee</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Jacksonville</LOCATION> and Baltimore.;   Bigger isn't
better;   The present mega-districts are so large that most residents have
little or no idea what district they live in. Council districts span grossly
disparate neighborhoods and communities of interest.;   There is more to
consider than representation ratios and the workloads of council members.
Perhaps the most important reason to consider increasing the number of
districts is to avoid diluting the voting strength of racial and ethnic
groups. Veterans of the redistricting process know that the massive size and
population of the present districts make it nearly impossible to create
districts with majorities of Latinos and Asian-Americans. Indeed, the present
system tends to force the creation of districts that pit ethnic groups and
other communities of interest against one another.;   The Voting Rights Act
and wise political judgment both militate in favor of a more diverse council.
Aside from one Hispanic and one Asian-American council member who were
appointed to the seats of resigning members and who were later re-elected,
only two Asian or Latino council members have been elected in a city that now
has a minority population of non-Hispanic whites.;   Boost to minority groups;
  The addition of a few more districts, say two or four, would make the
council more representative, less burdened, and more reflective of the city's
ethnic diversity. Additional districts could make a majority Asian
American-Pacific Islander district a possibility -- without irregularly shaped
district lines that divide neighborhoods.;   Apart from incumbents' vested
interest in the present system, the only serious objection to a larger council
would be the additional cost to the city. This cost might be countered by
decreasing the budget of each council member, assuming that constituent
service loads would decrease. Generally speaking, however, the increased cost
would be negligible in comparison to the city's overall spending. In any
event, the investment in democracy is worth making.;   Increasing the number
of districts would involve a change in the charter, and thus approval by the
electorate. The council is about to consider placing on an upcoming ballot a
charter amendment to improve the redistricting process. The council should
take the opportunity also to improve the quality of representation by making
increased districts a part of any charter adjustment.;   Engines for change;  
But assuming that the council is not inclined to lead the city toward such an
amendment, what might supply the impetus for change?;   First, a petition
drive among those who stand to benefit most from better representation might
be successful. Specifically, Asian-Americans and <ORGANIZATION>Pacific Islanders</ORGANIZATION>, as well as
other communities who feel poorly served by the system, ought to seize the
moment. Second, the mayor's office, which has advocated a more representative
government, ought to provide leadership.;   Given the vast amounts of
political inertia that hogtie participation in <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION> government, action is
unlikely. But the people of <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION> ought to weigh in their own minds whether
it is worth voting for one eighty-thousandth of a pol. (box)  </TEXT>

JOSEPH N. BELL: THE MAIL ROLLS IN: KFAC TO MISSOURI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEPH N. BELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The columns that draw the most mail never fail to surprise me. 
</P>
<P>
It is one of the arrogances of columnists that we tend to believe that the 
things that agitate us the most are mirrored by those who read the column. And, 
of course, that often isn't true. 
</P>
<P>
It has been some months since I dealt with letters here, and during that span 
the three columns that drew the most mail were: the demise of KFAC, my 
homecoming visit to the <ORGANIZATION>University of Missouri</ORGANIZATION> and the narrative of a World War 
II experience that led me to an advertisement in the <DATE>Nov. 22, 1941</DATE>, New Yorker 
magazine. 
</P>
<P>
What the KFAC mail told me is that someone is missing a bet by not starting a 
classical music station -- or converting an existing one -- in <LOCATION>Orange County</LOCATION>. 
The audience is large and remarkably faithful. As <PERSON>Elizabeth Thacker</PERSON> of Mission 
Viejo wrote: "KFAC's classical music programs enriched and saved my life. Over 
and over again." 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Ethel Mae Lambrinch of Huntington Beach</ORGANIZATION> noted, "Isn't it ironic that the 
ever-improving quality available in tapes and discs is mostly used for 
mind-shattering, all-sound-alike rock 'n' roll?" 
</P>
<P>
And <PERSON>Rachel May</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Santa Ana</LOCATION> wrote: "What can we do to get a good classical 
music station back on the air? I am willing to pay a modest amount of money, as 
I'm sure many classical music lovers might also. I would guess the demographics 
of classical music lovers would show them to be a smallish but potentially 
lucrative segment of the population for advertisers." 
</P>
<P>
Are any <LOCATION>Orange County</LOCATION> entrepreneurs out there listening? 
</P>
<P>
The <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION> mail confirmed something I had only suspected: that all of <LOCATION>Orange 
County</LOCATION> didn't go to <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION>. Or claim to. 
</P>
<P>
A quite remarkable number of <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION> alums surfaced to share their own 
nostalgia trips with me. Typical was <PERSON>Charles Murry</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Huntington Beach</LOCATION>, who 
wrote that the ancient brick buildings of the <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION> campus "provide a tonic 
for the soul which the completely functional structures put up since World War 
II on all campuses cannot even approach." 
</P>
<P>
The column about the New Yorker advertisement that ran two weeks before the 
attack on <LOCATION>Pearl Harbor</LOCATION> and appeared to signal that attack to someone received 
the biggest response. 
</P>
<P>
A large ad and smaller ads inside the issue referred to a game board named "The 
Deadly Double" that was seemingly manufactured by a company that the 
intelligence community later found didn't exist. Eerily, two dice showed the 
numbers 12 and <DATE>7</DATE>, neither of which is found on standard dice. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>National Public Radio</ORGANIZATION> interviewed me and used a rather sizable segment of the 
interview on the air (in which -- by adroit editing -- they managed to expunge 
every mention of The Times). 
</P>
<P>
Some of the mail was fascinating. 
</P>
<P>
Retired <ORGANIZATION>Marine Corps</ORGANIZATION> Capt. <PERSON>Louis Bushnell</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Santa Ana</LOCATION>, for example, enclosed a 
copy of an ad that appeared a few days before the attack in the <LOCATION>Honolulu</LOCATION> 
Advertiser. (<ORGANIZATION>Bushnell</ORGANIZATION> was born and raised in that city.) 
</P>
<P>
It takes a considerable stretch of the imagination to read subversive messages 
into this ad of a silk importing company, but <ORGANIZATION>Naval Intelligence</ORGANIZATION> apparently 
gave it a great deal of attention before dismissing it. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Bill Preston</PERSON>, a former advertising man who now lives in <LOCATION>Huntington Beach</LOCATION>, 
completed an intriguingly detailed analysis of questions raised by the New 
Yorker ad. For example, how were the seven teaser ads placed so precisely, how 
did the advertiser get island treatment for his one-column ad, why didn't <ORGANIZATION>Naval 
Intelligence</ORGANIZATION> follow up on the source of the artwork or typography, both of 
which carry distinctive stamps? That sort of thing. 
</P>
<P>
Preston sent the ad and his letter to nine "much-above-average thinkers" 
(including a mystery writer) and asked them to comment on the puzzle. He has 
promised to deliver the results to me. 
</P>
<P>
The most frustrating mail to report on are the long, thoughtful letters that 
are difficult to excerpt. 
</P>
<P>
I've had two such letters from <PERSON>Ray Bracy</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Tustin</LOCATION>, the most recent on the 
names of special-interest groups. He concluded: "The voters of <LOCATION>Irvine</LOCATION> . . . 
have told the world that they believe it is quite all right to have a group of 
second-class citizens. Now, if we can just get those subversives out of the 
schools. . . . You were accurate in calling it McCarthyism brought up to date. 
So where is our <PERSON>Joe Welsh</PERSON>?" 
</P>
<P>
And <PERSON>Sheldon Karlan</PERSON> of Buena Park wrote how in his view the growth of individual 
freedom "has become equated with (moral) decadence," supporting his thesis with 
half a dozen specific examples. 
</P>
<P>
Both letters merit longer treatment than I can give here and will be held as 
the possible subjects of future columns. 
</P>
<P>
And then, of course, there are the zingers. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Bill Hartman</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Cypress</ORGANIZATION> wrote: "You must be the slob that sits around the TV 
laughing at such off-color shows as 'Married With Children.' You know, just a 
'wide variety of people doing a wide variety of things.' I'll still take a 
little Republican intolerance any day compared to the barnyard society you seem 
to espouse." 
</P>
<P>
And a correspondent who identifies himself only as "Jim" wrote: "Please stop 
trying to protect my civil rights! Myself and many respectable friends have 
functioned well because we know how to act in society. I don't need your 
crusading to tell me what I can and cannot do. You have absolutely no idea what 
the life style of the average gay is outside of Orange County. . . . I feel 
patronized in a way that a black person would when the white liberal admits he 
knows how it is to be black." 
</P>
<P>
Jim thoughtfully told me I could respond in my column, but I'm not sure what 
I'm being accused of here. Offhand, I don't know any white liberals who make 
such claims. We just have this funny feeling that everyone ought to have the 
same rights, including <PERSON>Jim</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, there are the phone calls. I received one the other day from Irmalee 
Desenberg of Corona del Mar, who wants the world to know that good Samaritans 
aren't an extinct breed, after all. 
</P>
<P>
Irmalee and her husband, <PERSON>Bud</PERSON>, were headed for a reunion at <ORGANIZATION>Stanford University</ORGANIZATION> 
over the holidays when <PERSON>Irmalee</PERSON> went to sleep at the wheel and their car 
miraculously crossed four lanes of opposing traffic on Interstate 5 near 
<LOCATION>Bakersfield</LOCATION> and turned over. 
</P>
<P>
Even more miraculously, neither of the Desenbergs was badly hurt, but the 
experience was made much less shattering by a young man who stopped immediately 
after the accident and stayed with them throughout the ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
He loaded all their possessions in his car, followed the ambulance to the 
hospital, stayed until they were pronounced OK and released, and then drove 
them to <LOCATION>Stanford</LOCATION>, although he was going only to <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
His name is <PERSON>Frank Drolep</PERSON>, he works in the <LOCATION>Ontario</LOCATION> Fire Department, and he's 
unmarried. 
</P>
<P>
"I plan to find him a good wife," <PERSON>Irmalee</PERSON> said. "It's the least I can do."

FT  10 MAR 92 / Presidential front-runners eager to convince today: Super
Tuesday test for Democrats and Republicans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BY all logic, Governor <PERSON>Bill Clinton</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION>, a Democrat, and <PERSON>Mr George
Bush</PERSON>, a Republican and the president, should be smiling tonight. They ought
to win most - in <PERSON>Mr Bush</PERSON>'s case all  - the 11 Democratic primaries and
caucuses and eight Republican primaries that mark the heaviest day yet in
election year, now known universally as Super <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
But elections are not only about simple winners and losers. Especially in
the long primary season, expectations count a lot, which means that for both
front-runners anything less than a series of convincing victories will be
instantly, and perhaps correctly, interpreted as signs of continuing
vulnerability. Super <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, therefore, carries risks as well as rewards.
<PERSON>Mr Bush</PERSON>'s problem, unlikely to disappear today, is with the third of
Republican voters who decline to support him in primaries. He has campaigned
heavily in the last two weeks, dispensing presidential largesse almost
everywhere he has been, and is unlikely to lose a single state. His lead in
the delegate count is already overwhelming and he will take almost all the
421 more to be allocated today.
But he could still be embarrassed by <PERSON>Mr Pat Buchanan</PERSON> in the south, for
example in <LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION>, where another right-winger, former <PERSON>Ku Klux Klan</PERSON> man
<PERSON>David Duke</PERSON>, a local son, is also on the ballot; in <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION> and even in
<LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, which the president calls home; and in the depressed <LOCATION>New England</LOCATION>
states of <LOCATION>Rhode Island</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION>.
Whatever happens, <PERSON>Mr Buchanan</PERSON> has promised to keep on waging his ideological
warfare, moving to <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> a week from today and, he says, all
the way to the last primary in early <DATE>June</DATE> in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, where <PERSON>Mr Bush</PERSON> is
not popular. Sooner or later <PERSON>Mr Buchanan</PERSON> will run out of steam and money but
his continued ability to goad <PERSON>Mr Bush</PERSON> does the president's image little
good. Perhaps for this reason, the president has decided for the moment to
remain in the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION>.
On the Democratic side, the stakes for <PERSON>Mr Clinton</PERSON> are even higher today. His
tactically well-planned and well-financed campaign always banked on a big
Super <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, with seven of the 11 state polls being held on his natural
border and southern turf.
He might also be the principal beneficiary of the end yesterday of the
campaign of <PERSON>Tom Harkin</PERSON>, the liberal Senator from <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Mr Harkin</PERSON> yesterday
studiously avoided expressing a preference for any candidate. Organised
labour, <PERSON>Mr Harkin</PERSON>'s bulwark, may find the centrist <PERSON>Mr Clinton</PERSON> more amenable
than <PERSON>Mr Paul Tsongas</PERSON>, who favours tax breaks and incentives for business,
and former <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> governor <PERSON>Jerry Brown</PERSON>, who attacks the political
establishment, of which labour remains a part.
But <PERSON>Mr Clinton</PERSON> still has not established himself as a candidate in whom the
Democratic electorate has great confidence. In part this is because of
questions about his character, raised first in allegations of marital
infidelity and draft evasion and now over his financial relationship as
governor with an <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION> real estate developer. It also reflects the fact
that the Democratic race has become much nastier.
<PERSON>Mr Tsongas</PERSON> reflected over the weekend that he did not really like negative
political advertising but that has not stopped him attacking <PERSON>Mr Clinton</PERSON>, and
vice versa, and it certainly has not stopped <PERSON>Mr Brown</PERSON> going for both, but
especially <PERSON>Mr Clinton</PERSON>, indiscriminately.
Four years ago, Super <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> produced four separate Democratic winners.
This time, most of the 11 races appear to be between <PERSON>Mr Clinton</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mr
Tsongas</PERSON>, but the one which is a real litmus test for <PERSON>Mr Clinton</PERSON>'s
credibility is <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>. He can afford losses in <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Rhode Island</LOCATION>
and <LOCATION>Delaware</LOCATION> and knows that in several other states <PERSON>Mr Tsongas</PERSON> has barely
campaigned, including <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, which has most delegates at stake.
But <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, an ethnic and economic potpourri of Californian dimensions, now
conforms to no stereotype and the <PERSON>Tsongas</PERSON> appeal to the better-educated
white and hispanic middle classes could offset the clear <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> advantage
in money and organisation in the state. It is worth recalling that another
Greek from <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Mr Michael Dukakis</PERSON>, achieved a critical primary
victory there in <DATE>1988</DATE>.
A loss in <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, or even a narrow victory, would not knock <PERSON>Mr Clinton</PERSON> off
the front-runner's perch, assuming he performs to expectations elsewhere.
But it would make him nervous, to put it mildly, about next week's
confrontations in the big northern industrialised states of <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> as well as the one in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> on <DATE>April 7</DATE>.
For, although he already has a handy lead in the delegate count, the
Democrats are also electing a considerable number who will go the convention
in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> in <DATE>July</DATE> committed to no candidate. The prize of an assured first
ballot victory at the convention remains some way off.

REMOTE WOLF POINT RANCHES TRY TO SNARE VISITORS

<DATELINE>
<P>
WOLF POINT, Mont. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hard as it may be to believe, <ORGANIZATION>Amtrak</ORGANIZATION> does stop here. 
</P>
<P>
With a population of 3,074, <ORGANIZATION>Wolf Point</ORGANIZATION> is also the smallest city in the <LOCATION>United 
States</LOCATION> offering regularly scheduled, commercial flights. 
</P>
<P>
But the rails are the lifeline in this expansive agricultural region known as 
<LOCATION>Missouri River Country</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Wedged in by the <LOCATION>North Dakota</LOCATION> border and <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> to the north, <ORGANIZATION>Wolf Point</ORGANIZATION>'s 
wheat farmers and cattle ranchers might seem an unlikely presence on the 
tourism bandwagon. 
</P>
<P>
But in these tough times for <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s small farmers, promoting tourism as an 
adjunct to farming is one way <ORGANIZATION>Wolf Point</ORGANIZATION> and the surrounding communities are 
attempting to keep pace. 
</P>
<P>
Everything is big out here -- the prairies, the cultivated fields, the sky. 
There are few trees in any direction to break the view. Parents routinely drive 
children 50 miles for a piano lesson. 
</P>
<P>
Farmers, long isolated by the sheer size of their properties, usually build a 
spare house or two to accommodate help. Today, with the farm economy down and 
farmers being paid by the government not to grow, these spare homes sit empty. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Help <ORGANIZATION>With Chores 
</P>
<P>
Wolf Point</ORGANIZATION> isn't a tropical resort, but you can rent a furnished two-bedroom 
house for <MONEY>$150</MONEY> a week. If you wish, you can help with ranch chores such as 
calving or branding. Or just read a book, take a walk or do nothing at all. 
</P>
<P>
This is a part of <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> that few people visit. In <LOCATION>Missouri River Country</LOCATION>, you 
will be hobnobbing with working people, not polished tour guides, and you'll 
get a glimpse inside the skin of a community that is not exactly the hub of 
anything. 
</P>
<P>
A sense of remoteness is ever present. You can gaze 100 miles across the 
rolling <LOCATION>Missouri River</LOCATION> breaks and study the approaching storm clouds. Thunder 
echoes and lightning crackles. 
</P>
<P>
Coffee at the <ORGANIZATION>General Sherman Motor Inn</ORGANIZATION> -- the town's largest motel -- is <MONEY>35 
cents</MONEY>. Steak and eggs, with juice, toast and coffee, tops the menu at <MONEY>$4</MONEY>. 
</P>
<P>
So what does one do after breakfast in <LOCATION>Wolf Point</LOCATION>? 
</P>
<P>
If you are staying in <PERSON>John Rabenberg</PERSON>'s $150-a-week furnished spare house, you 
might go flying with your host. He has a private landing strip on his ranch, 
and for a small fee takes passengers for rides. He also can supply motorbikes 
or horses. 
</P>
<P>
Rabenberg's place is only one of more than a dozen cattle, hay or wheat ranches 
in <LOCATION>Wolf Point</LOCATION> with an extra house for rent. 
</P>
<P>
Depending on the season and the sort of ranch work being done, visitors can 
watch or participate in branding, cattle drives, planting, harvesting and other 
ranch chores. 
</P>
<P>
Another effort to cope with changing times in <ORGANIZATION>Wolf Point</ORGANIZATION> is being waged by 
<PERSON>Louis Taovs</PERSON>. Beneath a green baseball cap, <PERSON>Taovs</PERSON>' eyes twinkle as he leads 
visitors through what he claims to be the largest and most complete collection 
of <PERSON>John Deere</PERSON> farm equipment in the world. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Deere Collection 
</P>
<P>
Taovs</ORGANIZATION>' collection overflows 14 cavernous sheds and includes at least one of 
everything <PERSON>Deere</PERSON> ever made, dating to an <DATE>1892</DATE> steam tractor. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the spotlessly well-kept collection includes 500 tractors, Model A 
and <ORGANIZATION>T Fords</ORGANIZATION>, the complete Mark series of Lincolns, and hundreds of odd antique 
water pumps, grinding wheels and assorted farm paraphernalia. 
</P>
<P>
It is all currently on display at Taovs' LLL Ranch, but not for long. Last 
<DATE>summer</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>Burlington Northern Railroad</ORGANIZATION> donated 25 acres to the <ORGANIZATION>Wolf Point 
Chamber of Commerce</ORGANIZATION> for an industrial park and permanent museum to house the 
Taovs' collection. 
</P>
<P>
Other visitors stroll down Main Street to <ORGANIZATION>Gene Martin</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Wolf Point Saddlery</ORGANIZATION> 
(213 Main St.). Martin has been making saddles by hand for 40 years. He 
explains each step in the custom-fitting, cutting and shaping processes. Martin 
ships hand-tooled belts and saddles as far away as <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>. Saddle prices 
start at <MONEY>$350</MONEY>. 
</P>
<P>
Due north of <ORGANIZATION>Wolf Point</ORGANIZATION>, only 14 miles from the Canadian border, vacationers 
reach <LOCATION>Scobey</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mont</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Highlights of the community include a combination golf course and squash club. 
The Pioneer Town and Museum is a recreated frontier town made up of buildings 
and equipment from the <LOCATION>Missouri River Country</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lots of Antiques 
</P>
<P>
There are board walkways leading to an old one-room schoolhouse and church, a 
general store filled with antiques, a <DATE>1915</DATE> doctor's office and even an old 
movie theater that now features live stage shows. 
</P>
<P>
Every <DATE>summer</DATE> there's a weeklong covered-wagon trip from nearby <LOCATION>Richland</LOCATION> to 
<LOCATION>Scobey</LOCATION>, culminating in an annual threshing bee held on the <DATE>Fourth of July</DATE> -- 
the biggest event of the year, with pancake breakfasts and barbecues, antique 
car shows and sports events. 
</P>

<HEAD>Thousands of Inmates Head Home on Thanksgiving Furloughs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By THEASA TUOHY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   It's business as usual in state prison systems as thousands of
inmates around the nation go home for Thanksgiving. Only a few
states have no furlough provisions, and several are expanding or
adopting such programs.
   ``It's normal business,'' <PERSON>John Perry</PERSON>, spokesman for <ORGANIZATION>Vermont's
Department of Corrections</ORGANIZATION>, said of prison furloughs. In its inmate
population of 840, about 75 will go home for Thanksgiving.
   Up to 1,000 inmates in <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION>, 500 in <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION>, 500 in <LOCATION>New
York</LOCATION> and 300 in <LOCATION>Oregon</LOCATION> are set to spend Thanksgiving outside prison
walls.
   The numbers are smaller in other systems, but the trend is toward
release despite the presidential-campaign controversy stirred by
President-elect <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON> and, last week, the canceling of
Thanksgiving furloughs for 21 <LOCATION>Maryland</LOCATION> inmates because of adverse
publicity.
   While some officials concede inmates can abuse such programs,
many insist furloughs are an effective way to relieve prison
overcrowding and prepare inmates for life outside prison. Most
states allow only minimum-security prisoners to leave on furlough,
and many exclude convicted sex offenders.
   During the presidential campaign, <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> repeatedly attacked his
Democratic opponent, <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON>Michael Dukakis</PERSON>, over his
state's furlough program. The <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> campaign often cited the case of
convicted murderer <PERSON>Willie Horton</PERSON>, who raped a woman in <LOCATION>Maryland</LOCATION>
while on a weekend furlough. The <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION> program was changed
in <DATE>April</DATE> to make first-degree murderers serving life sentences
ineligible for furloughs.
   Furloughs have ``proven to be productive on a national scale,''
said <PERSON>Tom Powers</PERSON>, who became warden of the <ORGANIZATION>North Dakota State
Penitentiary</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>September</DATE>. He is allowing 15 prisoners to go home
for Thanksgiving in a new program he calls ``extremely
conservative.''
   The <ORGANIZATION>Kansas Department of Correction</ORGANIZATION> is developing regulations for
furloughs under a law passed this year.
   In the few states that have no such programs, including <LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>, prisoners generally are not
allowed out even for family funerals unless they are in handcuffs or
leg irons.
   ``We have no furlough program for anybody to go out overnight.
What we have is emergency releases with inmates in restraints for
funerals, to go to a relative's deathbed or something like that, and
that's it,'' said <LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION> Prison Director <PERSON>George Sumner</PERSON>.
   <PERSON>Leo Lalonde</PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION>Michigan Department of
Corrections</ORGANIZATION>, said his state has a similar policy. ``We don't have
anything for Thanksgiving or even <DATE>Christmas</DATE>. Although we do have the
highest rate of suicide around Christmas.''
   Two states that grant furloughs, <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION>, shy away
from holidays.
   ``We feel like it puts the inmate in a situation where there is
more temptation,'' said <PERSON>David White</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Arkansas Correction Department</ORGANIZATION>
spokesman.
   ``When the whole society is partying, it's awful hard not to
party yourself,'' said <PERSON>Dale Riley</PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION>Missouri
Department of Corrections and Human Resources</ORGANIZATION>, which quit holiday
furloughs three years ago after three prisoners were arrested one
weekend for assault and disorderly conduct. ``We just felt it was
best not to have them out.''
   In <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION>, prisoners can go home for up to 48 hours in
the custody of a relative, or can get a day off under a community
volunteer program in the custody of someone such as a minister.
   <PERSON>David Guth</PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION>North Carolina Department of
Correction</ORGANIZATION>, said he had no figures for Thanksgiving Day, but on <DATE>Nov.
20</DATE>, for example, 1,368 prisoners were on home or community release
out of a prison population of 17,916. Rapists and murders are not
automatically excluded, he said, but only those in minimum-security
facilities are eligible for furlough.
   ``Do we furlough people that are in for murder? Yes,'' said <PERSON>James
Flateau</PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION>Department of Correctional Services</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> where 8,177 inmates got furloughs last year. ``Probably a
dozen people convicted of ... murder are furloughed each year.''
   In <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION>, passes are granted ``based on the trustworthiness of
the inmate,'' said <PERSON>Debbie Herbert</PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION>Department
of Corrections</ORGANIZATION>.
   The furlough program in <LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION>, however, has been suspended
for study because a trusty working in the governor's mansion has
been accused of murder while on a weekend pass in <DATE>August</DATE>.
   In <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION>, with a prison population of 577, there are 20 inmates
going home for Thanksgiving.
   In the 20 years the program has been in effect, one inmate ran a
roadblock and killed a policeman and another inmate committed a
crime, said <PERSON>Warden Martin Magnusson</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Maine State Prison</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``If you have 2,000 successes and you have one that isn't a
success, that's the one you hear about,'' <PERSON>Magnusson</PERSON> said.
   <LOCATION>Maryland</LOCATION>'s Patuxent Institution, a rehabilitative

<HEAD>Snowy Owls Gather at Logan International Airport</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN GALVIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Snowy owls, a solitary species of beautiful birds
from frozen tundra far to the north, are returning to their winter
home near one of the nation's noisiest airports and one of its most
polluted harbors.
   The unusual gathering seems largely due to reminders of home and
an abundant food supply at the 1,800 acres of open field at <LOCATION>Logan
International Airport</LOCATION>, said <PERSON>Bradford Blodget</PERSON>, of the state <ORGANIZATION>Division
of Fisheries</ORGANIZATION> and Wildlife.
   ``<LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION> is probably one of the best places in the entire
country to see snowy owls,'' <PERSON>Blodget</PERSON> said. ``Probably the largest
concentration in the state is out at <LOCATION>Logan</LOCATION>.''
   In addition to providing a curious counterpoint to the modern
surroundings, the white birds are doing their part to clean up the
much-maligned <LOCATION>Boston Harbor</LOCATION> by feasting on the water rats populating
the grasslands between the runways and the water.
   More than 35 of the solitary, 20-inch-long, often brown-specked
owls perched on radio towers and swooped silently out over the water
and runways during their last December-to-March visit.
   <PERSON>Norman Smith</PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION>Massachusetts Audubon Society</ORGANIZATION>, banded 36
snowy owls at <LOCATION>Logan</LOCATION> for the first time last season. The birds, which
travel individually, start their trek south in <DATE>November</DATE> and continue
to migrate until <DATE>January</DATE>.
   So far this year, <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> has sighted three birds. The small number
could be part of a migratory pattern, or more birds could come as
the season progresses, he said.
   Smith is the state's snowy owl expert, but he concedes it is
difficult to say what draws them from the quiet desolation of the
tundra in <LOCATION>Greenland</LOCATION> and northern <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> to the chaotic environment
of the airport.
   ``Nobody really knows why they migrate,'' <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> said. ``Some
people try to correlate it to the drop in the <LOCATION>Lemming</LOCATION> supply (which
the owls feed on), some try to correlate it to the weather.''
   <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> said he believes it's just a normal migratory pattern that
draws the snowy owls south to the airport, where the noisy planes
don't disturb the birds.
   ``For the most part they ignore them,'' he said. ``Owls have
sensitive hearing, but the jet noise doesn't seem to phase them at
all.''
   The owls go about their lives at the airport much like they would
in the barren expanses of home, with a few extra activities, <PERSON>Smith</PERSON>
said.
   ``They roost primarily on the ground. And they seem to be most
active just before sunset and very active at night,'' <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> said.
   Sometimes they perch amid discarded ramps, buses and structures
rusting in an isolated section of the airfield, and occasionally the
owls venture out to the harbor islands.
   ``In the evenings, I've actually seen them fly to downtown
<LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>,'' <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> said, adding that the owls perch on roof tops and
eat the rats scurrying near open dumpsters in alleys.
   Although the noise from the planes doesn't bother the owls, <PERSON>Bob
D'Entremont</PERSON>, an airport employee since <DATE>1971</DATE> who has watched the
falcons, blue heron and geese that populate <LOCATION>Logan</LOCATION>, said the airport
is not always safe for the owls _ they often sit on the white lines
of the runways to blend in.
   ``We lose a couple a year. A couple get hit,'' said <PERSON>D'Entremont</PERSON>,
who said he has spotted snowy owls at <LOCATION>Logan</LOCATION> since <DATE>1975</DATE>.
   Logan is not the only place snowy owls congregate in the <LOCATION>United
States</LOCATION>. The birds travel along the seaboard and live along marshes
and fields. A large seasonal population can be found at <LOCATION>Plum Island</LOCATION>
off <LOCATION>Newburyport</LOCATION>.
   A <LOCATION>Logan</LOCATION> owl was once tracked to <LOCATION>Rhode Island</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>John F. Kennedy
International Airport</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> reports five or six snowy owls a
year.

      States' Efforts Vary
   In Taxing Residents
   MOST PEOPLE would swear that their home state does a good job of extracting every possible tax dollar from its residents. 
In truth, however, some states are far more aggressive than others in going after tax revenue. 

   "Tax effort" measures how a state exploits its tax base relative to other states. 
"It's what you do with what you have," explains a state-tax expert. 

   <LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION>, for example, has the highest per capita income in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, but it doesn't have a personal income tax. 
New Yorkers also have high income levels, on average, but the state tries to recapture a big chunk of those funds with a stiff income tax. 
Thus, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> has a higher tax effort than <LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION> when it comes to taxing personal income. 

   The Washington-based <ORGANIZATION>Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations</ORGANIZATION> has ranked the states in terms of overall tax effort, using <DATE>1985</DATE> data. 
It looked at major revenue sources -- sales taxes, property taxes, license fees, user charges, mineral revenues, and personal and business income taxes -- in calculating the size of the burden each state imposes on its tax base. 

   The top 10 in tax effort: <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>District of Columbia</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wisconsin</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Rhode Island</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION>. 
<LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>'s tax effort was <PERCENT>56%</PERCENT> greater than the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> average. 

   <LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New Hampshire</LOCATION> had the lowest tax-effort scores, <PERCENT>64%</PERCENT> below the national norm. 
Other states with comparatively low tax efforts: <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Delaware</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Tennessee</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION>. 

   Study Disputes Union
   On Mexican Border Jobs
   ORGANIZED LABOR has long complained about the bustling manufacturing belt that's sprung up in <LOCATION>Northern Mexico</LOCATION>. 
Union officials argue that <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> companies have exported thousands of jobs to factories in the Mexican border cities, taking advantage of that country's 90-cent-an-hour minimum wage. 

   Helping to spur this job migration across the <LOCATION>Rio Grande</LOCATION> has been a provision in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> tariff code that allows duty-free movement of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> products and components into <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>, as long as those items are integrated into products re-imported to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> 

   Labor has been urging <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> to repeal the tariff provisions as a means of saving jobs in the <LOCATION>U.S</LOCATION>. Now comes an exhaustive report by the <ORGANIZATION>International Trade Commission</ORGANIZATION> that says scrapping the tariff breaks would cause scarcely a blip in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> employment picture. 

   It's the huge differential between Mexican and <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> wages resulting from successive peso devaluations, not favorable tariff consideration, that's currently driving the U.S.-Mexican border economy, the <ORGANIZATION>ITC</ORGANIZATION> says. 
The commission couldn't find a single <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> company doing business on the border that said it would return to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> if the tariff provisions were repealed. 

   Repeal of the tariff provisions would likely cost jobs in <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> factories that have opened to supply components to the Mexican assembly plants, but the overall employment effect in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> "would be small," the <ORGANIZATION>ITC</ORGANIZATION> says. 
The bulk of these new supplier companies are in <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>. 

   Any movement to repeal the provisions would require action by a trade subcommittee of the <ORGANIZATION>House Ways and Means Committee</ORGANIZATION>. 
Says a subcommittee staff member, after reviewing the <ORGANIZATION>ITC</ORGANIZATION>'s findings: "The people who were scared to death about losing their program don't have anything to fear." 

   Retirees Shun Sun Belt
   And Most Other Moves
   PICTURES of retirees basking in <LOCATION>Sun Belt</LOCATION> retirement havens are everywhere in the winter months. 
So it's easy to assume that older Americans are migrating en masse to warmer climes. 
Wrong. 

   People aged 65 years and older actually show a marked tendency to stay put. 
Census Bureau figures show that fewer than <PERCENT>5%</PERCENT> of this age group change their geographic location. 

   The result is that the <LOCATION>Midwest</LOCATION>, the Great Lakes region, and parts of the <ORGANIZATION>Northeast</ORGANIZATION> are actually getting "grayer" than most of the Sun Belt. 
Younger people are moving out of these states, seeking better opportunities, and older people are staying on. 
In <DATE>1986</DATE>, 19 states had at least <PERCENT>12.5%</PERCENT> of their population aged 65 or older. 
Only one, <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, is a bona fide Sun Belt representative. 

   <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> is a stark exception to the graying of the <ORGANIZATION>Frost Belt</ORGANIZATION>. 
With a median age of 36, it has the oldest population of any state. 
In fact, for a glimpse of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> population in roughly 30 years, look at <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> right now. 
Its share of elderly (<PERCENT>18%</PERCENT> of the population is 65 years plus) is roughly what the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> population will look like in the year <DATE>2020</DATE>. 

   Six States Gain Bulk
   Of Legal Immigrants
   WHILE ILLEGAL aliens make the headlines, an unheralded but steady stream of lawful immigrants continues to pour into the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> 
In <DATE>1986</DATE>, nearly 602,000 foreigners were granted legal immigrant status. 
That's the highest figure in more than 50 years and a total slightly less than the population of <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION> 

   Where did these people go? 
The <ORGANIZATION>Immigration and Naturalization Service</ORGANIZATION> says that nearly three-quarters of the new arrivals headed for six states: <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>. 

   As for where they came from, the just-released <ORGANIZATION>INS</ORGANIZATION> <DATE>1986</DATE> Statistical Yearbook has an intriguing breakdown. 
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION> took in 13,600 Vietnamese immigrants. 
Nearly 22,000 Cubans landed in <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, as did 121 Romanians. 
<LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION> admitted 69 Filipinos and one Peruvian. 
And 68 Poles found a home in <LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Some 9.7 million People Jailed in Year Ending June 1988</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 9.7 million people were thrown in a jail
cell in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> during the year that ended <DATE>June 30, 1988</DATE>,
the <ORGANIZATION>Justice Department</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>Sunday</DATE>.
   During the same year, some 9.6 million people were released from
jail, and both numbers represented increases of <PERCENT>20 percent</PERCENT> over
<DATE>1983</DATE> figures, said the <ORGANIZATION>Office of Justice Statistics</ORGANIZATION> study.
   The average jail stay was three days, with <PERCENT>39 percent</PERCENT> of inmates
spending one day or less behind bars, <PERCENT>23 percent</PERCENT> spending two to
four days and <PERCENT>10 percent</PERCENT> spending five to seven days, the study
said.
   About <PERCENT>3 percent</PERCENT> served more than six months and <PERCENT>1 percent</PERCENT> spent
more than a year behind bars.
   On <DATE>June 30, 1988</DATE>, the jail population totaled 343,569, or 144 of
every 100,000 Americans, the study said. That rate was <PERCENT>47 percent</PERCENT>
higher than the 98 per 100,000 five years earlier.
   The study focused on local jails, defined as locally
administered confinement facilities holding people awaiting trial
or sentenced to terms usually of a year or less. About <PERCENT>51 percent</PERCENT>
of the people in jail had not been convicted of any crime when they
were incarcerated, while <PERCENT>49 percent</PERCENT> had been convicted, the same
level as in <DATE>1983</DATE>, the study found.
   The census did not include facilities in <LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Delaware</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Rhode Island</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Vermont</LOCATION> that combine jails with prisons,
which are state or federal institutions.
   The study did not indicate the main charges of the 9.7 million
brought into custody.
   Among the study's findings:
   _Jail populations in <LOCATION>Southern</LOCATION> states grew <PERCENT>61 percent</PERCENT> between
<DATE>1983</DATE> and <DATE>1988</DATE>, to a total of 143,751 on <DATE>June 30, 1988</DATE>, while jail
populations in the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION> increased <PERCENT>58 percent</PERCENT> to 91,559; the
<ORGANIZATION>Northeast</ORGANIZATION> jail population grew by <PERCENT>57 percent</PERCENT> to 57,613 and the
<LOCATION>Midwest</LOCATION> grew by <PERCENT>28 percent</PERCENT> to 50,646.
   _The states with the largest percentage increase between <DATE>June
30, 1983</DATE>, and the same day on <DATE>1988</DATE> were <LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION>, up <PERCENT>149 percent</PERCENT>;
<LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>, <PERCENT>104 percent</PERCENT>; <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, <PERCENT>93 percent</PERCENT>; <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> <PERCENT>86
percent</PERCENT>; <LOCATION>Tennessee</LOCATION>, <PERCENT>81 percent</PERCENT>.
   _The only places where jail populations declined were <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION>,
down <PERCENT>27 percent</PERCENT>, and <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION>, which reclassified an
institution from a jail to a prison.
   _The highest rates of jail inmates per 100,000 state residents
were in <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION>, 276; <LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION>, 255; <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, 229; <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>,
227; <LOCATION>Tennessee</LOCATION>, 222; and <LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION>, 222.
   _The lowest rates per 100,000 state residents were in <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>, 37;
<LOCATION>North Dakota</LOCATION>, 43; <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION>, 56; <LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION>, 72; and <LOCATION>New Hampshire</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>South Dakota</LOCATION>, both 73.
   _The female jail population rose <PERCENT>93 percent</PERCENT> during the five-year
period to 30,411 on <DATE>June 30, 1988</DATE>. Women still represented only <PERCENT>9
percent</PERCENT> of the total jail population, compared with <PERCENT>7 percent</PERCENT> in
<DATE>1983</DATE>. The male population rose <PERCENT>51 percent</PERCENT> to 313,158.
   _The percentage of juveniles in adult jails declined from <PERCENT>0.8
percent</PERCENT> in <DATE>1983</DATE> to <PERCENT>0.5 percent</PERCENT> in <DATE>1988</DATE>, reflecting a <PERCENT>3 percent</PERCENT> drop
for boys and a <PERCENT>4 percent</PERCENT> drop for girls.
   _The racial breakdown of inmates was <PERCENT>43 percent</PERCENT> non-Hispanic
whites, <PERCENT>41 percent</PERCENT> non-Hispanic blacks, <PERCENT>15 percent</PERCENT> Hispanics and <PERCENT>1
percent</PERCENT> either American Indians, <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION> natives, Asians or <ORGANIZATION>Pacific
Islanders</ORGANIZATION>.
   _Of the 667 people who died in jail during the year ending <DATE>June
30, 1988</DATE>, a total of 284 (<PERCENT>43 percent</PERCENT>) were suicides, 274 (<PERCENT>41
percent</PERCENT>) were illnesses not including AIDS, 66 (<PERCENT>10 percent</PERCENT>) died of
AIDS, 10 (<PERCENT>1 percent</PERCENT>) were homicide victims and 33 (<PERCENT>5 percent</PERCENT>) died
of other causes including accidents.
   _Jail capacity increased <PERCENT>30 percent</PERCENT> to 339,633 beds between <DATE>1983</DATE>
to <DATE>1988</DATE>, and the amount of rated capacity that was occupied totaled
<PERCENT>101 percent</PERCENT> in <DATE>1988</DATE>, up from <PERCENT>85 percent</PERCENT> <DATE>five years earlier</DATE>.
However, about 40,000 inmates, some <PERCENT>12 percent</PERCENT> of the jail
population on <DATE>June 30, 1988</DATE>, were being held for other correctional
authorities, including some 26,500 held because of overcrowding
elsewhere.
