<DESCRIPT>  SANTA-CLARA; COUNTY; FESTIVAL; LIST  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  THE Santa Clara County Fair's musical slate could best be likened to the menu
of a favorite neighborhood eatery -- nothing fancy, just tried-and-true fare
for the entire family. A careful musical gourmet should be able to find some
top-drawer blues, country and soul acts on the fair's two main stages. All the
acts on the 8,000-seat grandstand and 4,000-seat amphitheater stages are free
with fair admission.;    On the grandstand stage: Vaqueros Musical teams with
six other Hispanic acts for Noche de Estrellas III at 7 p.m. Saturday. The
rockin' oldies act Flash Cadillac has a concert -- complete with fireworks --
slated for 8:30 p.m. Sunday. Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons trot out those
memories with an 8 p.m. performance next Friday. Country diva Kathy Mattea,
who's been a major-league draw ever since she hit in '88 with "18 Wheels and a
Dozen Roses," has an 8 p.m. concert Aug. 3. The Bay Area's own living blues
legend, John Lee Hooker, teams with veteran rocker Elvin Bishop and jump-blues
specialists Little Charlie &amp; the Nightcats for an 8 p.m. show Aug. 4. Soul
crooner Freddie Jackson checks in for an 8 p.m. concert Aug. 9. The
Temptations, Motown's veteran stars, work at 4 and 8 p.m. Aug. 10.  </LEADPARA>

<DESCRIPT>  FAMILY; CHILDREN; ENTERTAINMENT  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  THERE'S plenty of family entertainment this week with two area county fairs
running concurrently. The Santa Clara County Fair will run daily through next
Sunday and the San Mateo County Fair and Floral Fiesta opens Tuesday and runs
through Aug. 18. Both have displays, exhibits, petting zoos, extensive
carnival rides and headliner entertainment. And both have discount days.
Taking advantage of these discounts can amount to a tidy savings if you're
escorting a number of children to the events.;    The 47th annual Santa Clara
County Fair has all the old favorites and many new attractions, including the
Gold Heist Stunt Show, a Kids' Korral, Jeff Allen's Magic Windows and elephant
rides.  </LEADPARA>

<DESCRIPT>  SANTA-CLARA; COUNTY; VOLUNTEER; MAN; DEATH; OBITUARY  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  Losing an election for Santa Clara County sheriff in 1970 didn't keep Larry
Romero from serving the cause of justice.;    Mr. Romero, a longtime Santa
Clara resident who has died at the age of 84, earned the respect of the law
enforcement community when he ran a surprisingly effective primary campaign 20
years ago. Soon afterward he volunteered as a reserve deputy sheriff to
oversee jailed drunken drivers in a weekend community service program.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     In the meantime, its Spanish baroque grandeur needs a couple of <MONEY>million
dollars</MONEY>' worth of cosmetic and structural renovation. The cosmetic rehab,
already begun, is breathtaking. Have a look for yourself: Open houses are

Attending a club show by the up-and-coming <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> band Too Much Joy is like

Regardless of what musical highway the lovable foursome ends up on, you can
count on dazzling repartee on subjects from capital punishment and blackjack
strategy to seducing the girl next door.;    The band's recently released
third album, "Cereal Killers," is a gem far more polished than the previous
"Green Eggs and Crack" and "Son of Sam I Am." In an era where most rock music
takes itself far too seriously, these guys know a good joke when they sing
one.;    Too Much Joy will wax ecstatic <DATE>Saturday</DATE> at the Catalyst, 1011 <LOCATION>Pacific

<DESCRIPT>  HISTORY; SANTA-CLARA; COUNTY; FESTIVAL  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  Before they could even have a Santa Clara County fair 50 years ago, they had
to find a place to hold it.;    It had been nearly three decades since any
kind of fair was held in Santa Clara County, and more than half a century
since the last full-fledged fair. The old fairgrounds along The Alameda had
long since been subdivided.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Local  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  SANTA CLARA COUNTY FAIR WAS REVIVED IN '41  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Out of the Past  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     During a <DATE>1937</DATE> luncheon, <ORGANIZATION>San Jose Chamber of Commerce</ORGANIZATION> directors began
discussing reviving the fair. A fair association was established that <DATE>summer</DATE>
and by <DATE>1939</DATE>, the association had decided an ideal location would be the
99-acre Miramonte stock farm -- complete with a horse-racing track -- on <ORGANIZATION>Tully
Road.</ORGANIZATION>;    It was even for sale -- <MONEY>$55,000</MONEY> to an outsider, <MONEY>$40,000</MONEY> if the
county wanted to buy it. Over another lunch the next year, fair boosters
decided to telegraph the owner to see if he would sell the property for
<MONEY>$35,000</MONEY>. He telegraphed the next day that he would, according to "A Brief
History of the <LOCATION>Santa Clara County</LOCATION> Fair" by retired <ORGANIZATION>Mercury News</ORGANIZATION> columnist <PERSON>Dick
Barrett.</PERSON>;    The property was among 10 sites, including the San Jose Speedway
property at <LOCATION>Alum Rock Avenue</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>King Road</ORGANIZATION> and two locations on <LOCATION>Saratoga
Avenue</LOCATION> near <LOCATION>Payne Avenue</LOCATION>, that were then submitted to the board of supervisors
for consideration. The Miramonte property, with the support of Supervisor <PERSON>Joe
McKinnon</PERSON>, was selected.;    <PERSON>McKinnon</PERSON> "ramrodded it through the board,"
remembers <PERSON>Francis Zingheim</PERSON>, a longtime fair association director. "The way
<PERSON>McKinnon</PERSON> went, the rest went.";    The <DATE>summer of 1941</DATE> was a busy one at the
new fairgrounds, as crews transformed a stubble field with broken fences into
a suitable setting. One expense was shoes for the county jail inmates who were
recruited to help with the work.;    There were about 175,000 people in <LOCATION>Santa
Clara County</LOCATION> then, and fair attendance hit nearly 100,000, despite the
sometimes chilly weather that accompanied its <DATE>October</DATE> run.;    Governor spoke
at opening;  On opening night, nearly 12,000 people shivered as they watched a
couple marry on stage and listened to Gov. <PERSON>Culbert L. Olson</PERSON> extol the richness
of the <LOCATION>Santa Clara Valley</LOCATION>. They inspected the exhibits, gorged themselves and
danced under a harvest moon.;    It was so cold that night that even the
horses and cattle in the display barns wore blankets, according to an account
in the <ORGANIZATION>Mercury Herald.</ORGANIZATION>;    A week of fair events followed. Some of the biggest
draws for many people were the horse races and horse shows. Agricultural,
livestock and home arts exhibits, including a baking contest, also were
popular.;    There was a huge mechanical robot that asked girls for their
phone numbers, a parade and a kids' day when schools filled 84 fair-bound
buses.;    War delayed return;  The <DATE>1941</DATE> fair was successful beyond
organizers' dreams, and they promised to return with an even more spectacular
event the following year. But World War II intervened, and the second fair of
the modern era wasn't held until 1946.;    There's been one every year since,
and the fairgrounds are still on the Miramonte property. But a lot has
changed. More land has been purchased. Attendance has soared -- more than
666,000 people came <DATE>last year</DATE>. It's a much more commercial fair now.;    "At
that time, it was more of a hometown deal," said <PERSON>Zingheim</PERSON>, who at age 79 still
works at the fair each <DATE>summer</DATE>. In the early days, he recalled, people used to
say, "The only time you get to see all your old friends is at weddings,
funerals and the county fair.";    But for at least one guy, the fair was a
bust. <PERSON>W.S. Payton</PERSON>, a janitor, worked all <DATE>summer</DATE> on his hooked rugs to complete
them in time to enter them in the fair, but he didn't belong to any women's
organizations or the Grange.;    He wasn't allowed to compete.  </TEXT>

<DESCRIPT>  PROFILE; MAN; BOXING; SHOOTING; VICTIM; SAN-JOSE  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  NEAR the railroad tracks in a funky neighborhood of once-thriving canneries in
San Jose, the Garden City Athletic Club has been converted from an old carpet
warehouse to a proving grounds for both club boxers and would-be world
champs.;    For some, it is also a bridge from the streets or even jail to
respectability, maybe fame.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Local  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  BOXER LOSES FINAL ROUND  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Inside, elevated 4 1/2 feet above the floor, is a boxing ring. To one side,
heavy, leather punching bags hang still, waiting for the next future world's
champ to bang himself into shape.;    <PERSON>Stevie Romero</PERSON>, <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION>'s contribution
to world class Lightweight Division contenders, trained here for his first
comeback fight after serving seven years in prison for drugs. He won on <DATE>Jan.
15</DATE> in <ORGANIZATION>Reno</ORGANIZATION>, by the way.;    <PERSON>Lupe</PERSON> "Little Guns" <PERSON>Gutierrez</PERSON>, who's ranked among
the top three or four featherweights in the world, is due in to work out any
second.;    <PERSON>David Vedder</PERSON>, a world class light heavyweight, trains here, too,
when he's not driving a <ORGANIZATION>Santa Clara County Transit</ORGANIZATION> bus. A year ago <DATE>February</DATE>,
he was one fight away from a crack at <PERSON>Tommy Hearns</PERSON>' world title. But a guy
named <PERSON>Virgil Hill</PERSON> stopped him in 12 rounds.;     <PERSON>LARRY VALLES</PERSON> was not in their
class. He was just a loose-change club boxer with four or five pro fights
behind him, most of them losses. Still, he was supposed to show up <DATE>Monday</DATE> at <TIME>5
p.m.</TIME> but didn't, which was weird because he'd been as regular as a clock --
<DATE>Monday</DATE> through <DATE>Friday</DATE>, <TIME>5 p.m.</TIME> -- since he got out of <ORGANIZATION>Santa Clara County Jail</ORGANIZATION>
in late February.;    "I can't say he had any real promise as a contender,"
says <PERSON>Jeff Grmoja</PERSON>, a big guy with Yugoslavian blood who is also the club's head
trainer. "But he said he was tired of wasting time. He wanted to put the
street life behind him and get back into shape.;    As for street life,
<PERSON>Valles</PERSON>' record wasn't so hot, either. He'd been in and out of jail since <DATE>1982</DATE>.
He'd get busted for drugs. He'd do time. He'd hit the streets, and the cycle
would start again. Except sometimes, he'd resist arrest, which would cause a
judge to tack on more jail time.;    "I told him there was a way to prove
himself. First, he had to drop 45 pounds," <PERSON>Grmoja</PERSON> recalls. "He hit the bags,
shadow box every day. In one month, he went from 195 to 175 pounds. As far as
I could tell, he looked clean. He had a new lady friend, drove a new truck.
Things were looking up.";    "That's why I was so shocked when I got the phone
call.";    <PERSON>Larry Valles</PERSON>, 28, died from multiple gunshot wounds <DATE>Monday</DATE>
<TIME>afternoon</TIME>, four hours before he was supposed to work out at the club.;    HE
DIED at a house in <LOCATION>East San Jose</LOCATION>, only a few blocks from his own apartment and
also near an apartment where his sister lives.;    People in the house gave
conflicting stories. At first they told sheriff's deputies that <PERSON>Valles</PERSON> had
arrived at the door bleeding from gunshot wounds. Later, they said he might
have been shot inside the house.;    The cops are still sorting things out.
Motives? It would be easy to guess. Drugs do come to mind.;    <PERSON>Jeff Grmoja</PERSON>,
who gave Valles a chance to start over and watched him train faithfully every
day, can only sit in his office surrounded by fight posters of Duran, <PERSON>Cooney</PERSON>,
<PERSON>Foreman</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Tyson</LOCATION>, Sugar <PERSON>Ray Leonard</PERSON> and a guy named <PERSON>Mike Jameson</PERSON>, who knocked
him out in his only pro fight, and wonder.;    "You and I know that a lot of
these kids don't come from upper-middle-class backgrounds. For a lot of them,
fighting is a ticket out of trouble. This kid had been working his . . . off

<DESCRIPT>  HOLIDAY; CHARITY; SOUTH-BAY; DECREASE; SUPPORT; LIST; CHART  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  For the poor of the South Bay who face a bleak Thanksgiving holiday, so little
has been donated while so much is needed.;   More families than ever are
seeking assistance this year from charitable organizations that provide meals
for the poor, the homeless and the unemployed.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Front  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  MORE NEEDY, LESS FOOD FOR CHARITIES  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Additional information attached to the end of this article; Chart attached to
the end of this article  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     And yet, with Thanksgiving less than two weeks away, the contributions of
food from communities of plenty have been a trickle, not a torrent of good
will.;   The charities need turkeys and the makings for stuffings and
trimmings. They need hams, canned fruit and vegetables, and staples such as
rice and beans and potatoes. Or they need money to buy food for the needy.;   
"With the way the economy is right now, the way food donations are coming in,
things could be very tight," said <PERSON>Joey Scanapico</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>CityTeam Ministries</ORGANIZATION> in
downtown <LOCATION>San Jose.</LOCATION>;   Some examples:;   (check) CityTeam Ministries officials,
worried they wouldn't have enough food to provide the 3,500 Thanksgiving Day
meal boxes promised to needy families, cut off sign-ups for the boxes early,
shutting out at least 100 families.;   (check) The <ORGANIZATION>Salvation Army</ORGANIZATION> was feeding
about 1,100 people daily in <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION>. Now it's more than 3,000 a day.
Thanksgiving turkeys are in short supply.;   (check) <LOCATION>Tri-City</LOCATION> Volunteers in
<LOCATION>Fremont</LOCATION> provided holiday food baskets for 300 low-income families last year.
Executive Director <PERSON>Barbara Chabot</PERSON> estimates that this year they'll be asked to
help 400. "Right now we have zero turkeys," <PERSON>Chabot</PERSON> said Thursday.;   (check)
In <DATE>1990</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>Second Harvest Food Bank</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION>, which supplies a large
number of charitable organizations in <LOCATION>Santa Clara</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>San Mateo</LOCATION> counties,
provided other agencies with food for about 62,000 people a month. This year,
the number has risen to more than 74,000, said Executive Director <PERSON>Mary Ellen
Heising.</PERSON>;   It is hard to keep up.;   Food isn't the only charitable item in
short supply. So is money.;   Donations to Catholic Charities of <LOCATION>Santa Clara
County</LOCATION>, which assists 20 organizations, have declined <PERCENT>10 percent</PERCENT> this year,
while the demand for services has increased <PERCENT>5 percent</PERCENT>, said <PERSON>Michael Tomars</PERSON>,
director of administration.;   The one bright spot appeared to be donations to
<ORGANIZATION>United Way</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Santa Clara County</LOCATION>, which could wind up its annual contribution
campaign, now about half done, by exceeding its <MONEY>$26.5 million</MONEY> goal, said <PERSON>Buck
McCleneghan</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>United Way</ORGANIZATION>'s senior vice president.;   <ORGANIZATION>United Way</ORGANIZATION> donations at
valley firms show an <PERCENT>11.3 percent</PERCENT> increase over last year, he said. The goal,
for funds that assist 114 local organizations, is <PERCENT>7.5 percent</PERCENT> higher than last
year.;   But with the holidays approaching, the immediate need is for food.
Even by closing reservations early, CityTeam expects to provide 1,000 more
families with food boxes this Thanksgiving than last -- nearly a <PERCENT>30 percent</PERCENT>
increase. Overall, the organization will feed about 14,000 people.;   "The
poor are being squeezed on both ends," <PERSON>Scanapico</PERSON> said. "Because of the
recession, people aren't giving as much. Also because of job layoffs, more
people are coming for help.";   The recession "has hit, and it hit hard," said
<PERSON>Barbara Redding</PERSON>, family services supervisor for the <ORGANIZATION>Salvation Army.</ORGANIZATION>;   In
addition to its regular program, the <ORGANIZATION>Salvation Army</ORGANIZATION> expects to help 525
familes for Thanksgiving, and anticipates aiding 3,000 families for
Christmas.;   That's evident to Heising at <ORGANIZATION>Second Harvest</ORGANIZATION> from some of the new
clientele being served by the agency's food bank supplies.;   "Not only are
they serving more people, but (for) longer periods of time," she said. "And
they are poorer, and they are younger. Most of the people who come to the
programs are families with children, 85 to <PERCENT>90 percent</PERCENT> of them.";   Charity
officials hope that, as in years past, contributions will pick up when the
holiday draws near.;   A big payoff could come soon. Since <DATE>Nov. 8</DATE>, Boy Scouts,
Cub Scouts and Explorers have been going door to door to leave bags for people
to fill with canned and boxed goods. Today they will return to pick up donated
items for the food bank.;   But throughout the region, the situation is mostly
bleak.;   In <LOCATION>Gilroy</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>St. Joseph's Family Center</ORGANIZATION> served 300 families last year.
This year, said associate director <PERSON>Pearl Blea</PERSON>, "we have an awful lot of new
people coming in, just out of work, mostly families. . . . We just hope for
the best."; WHERE TO GIVE; Here are some of the charitable organizations that
need donations of food or money:;   <LOCATION>SANTA CLARA</LOCATION> COUNTY; (box) CityTeam

<DESCRIPT>  GARDEN; BRIEF  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  Begonias, by golly; Dan Englund of Monterey will discuss his specialty, cane

<TEXT>   BEST BUY; Budget bloomers; Many nurseries are clearing out <DATE>summer</DATE> flowering
plants to make way for fall stock. Look for garden mums, priced from <MONEY>$2.50</MONEY> in
one-gallon containers; azaleas, from <MONEY>$5</MONEY> in one-gallon containers, and tree
roses, from <MONEY>$12</MONEY> in two-gallon containers.; VEGETABLES; Pinch tomatoes; Pinch
blooms off tomato plants to direct their energy into fruit that already has
set (started to develop). Tomatoes that set after Labor Day fail to mature in
time for harvest before the first frost. Fruit toward the end of the season is
always smaller than the first fruit of the summer.; FREEBIES; Get a catalog;
Whether you need information on drought-time water management or pest
management, the <ORGANIZATION>University of California</ORGANIZATION>'s updated publications catalog is the
book for you. The <DATE>1991</DATE> catalog contains hundreds of titles on field crops,
soil, chemicals, farm management, forestry, fruits and more. The catalog can
be ordered free from <ORGANIZATION>ANR Publications</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Dept</LOCATION>. NR, <ORGANIZATION>University of California</ORGANIZATION>,
<LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION> 94608-1239. It is also available from most county Cooperative
Extension offices, and from the <ORGANIZATION>Agricultral Information and Publications</ORGANIZATION>
office at the <ORGANIZATION>University of California</ORGANIZATION>, Davis.; YOUR CHECKLISTY; (box) Prolong
blooming on tuberous begonias, dahlias and fuchsias by pinching off faded
flowers.; (box) Divide and replant crowded perennials.; (box) Trim bearded
iris foliage to fans six inches from the rhizomes.; (box) Plant new irises and
divide others if they failed to bloom well this year.; (box) Plant autumn
blooming crocus now for a harvest of true saffron in <LOCATION>November.</LOCATION>; (box) Dry
flowers for arrangements.; (box) Shape evergreen hedges for the last time this
year.; (box) Disbud camellias, leaving only one bloom bud per branch to get
the largest blossoms.; THE LAST WORD; Hand in glove; Disposable latex or vinyl
gloves like the ones dentists use are useful in the garden too. Tough, yet
allowing sensation, they are good for plucking insect pests off tomato and
bean plants and protecting hands digging in wet soil. A box of 100 costs less
than <MONEY>$20</MONEY> at the grocery or drugstore and should last several years.  </TEXT>
