<HEAD>Study Recommends More Aggressive Response To Breast Lumps</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Physicians need to act more aggressively on
the initial complaints of women _ especially younger women _ who
find lumps in their breasts, a study of breast cancer malpractice
claims and lawsuits indicates.
   The study by the <ORGANIZATION>Physician Insurers Association of America</ORGANIZATION> found
that in <PERCENT>69 percent</PERCENT> of cases where claims were paid because breast
cancer diagnosis was delayed, the patient had discovered the lump.
   ``The physician needs to be impressed by such findings and order
follow-up studies,'' said the report.
   ``This study indicates that self-discovery often may be ignored,
especially in younger women where the incidence of malignancy is
thought to be less than in older women'' and is more difficult to
detect, the study said.
   The study reviewed 273 paid claims reported by 21 member
companies of the association. All of the cases involved a delay in
diagnosis of breast cancer.
   Women with breast cancer have best chances of surviving when it
is discovered and treated in earliest stages.
   The study, released at the association's annual meeting in <DATE>May</DATE>,
was discussed by members of the study committee in telephone
interviews last week.
   Though breast cancer is more common among older women, the study
indicates that delayed diagnosis in younger women results in the
majority of lawsuits. Nearly <PERCENT>70 percent</PERCENT> of the cases involved women
under age 50, and <PERCENT>40 percent</PERCENT> were filed by women under 40.
   The most common reason for delay in diagnosis was that ``the
physical findings at examination failed to impress the physician,''
the report said. This was the case for <PERCENT>55 percent</PERCENT> of the women.
   The second most common reason, found in <PERCENT>35 percent</PERCENT> of cases, was
that mammogram reports were negative. In <PERCENT>14 percent</PERCENT>, mammograms
were inconclusive.
   ``Doctors have to be more suspicious of the incidence of cancer
in the breast ... and can't depend entirely on the mammogram,''
said <PERSON>Dr. Sylvan H. Eisman</PERSON>, a distinguished professor emeritus of
clinical medicine at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Pennsylvania School of
Medicine</ORGANIZATION>, who directed the study.
   The <ORGANIZATION>American Medical Association</ORGANIZATION> had no comment on the findings.
   The study suggests that a biopsy always follow any suspicious
findings.
   ``It's foolish not to do it (a biopsy) if there's reasonable
cause of suspicion,'' <PERSON>Eisman</PERSON> said.
   The study also found that family history was unknown in <PERCENT>37
percent</PERCENT> of the cases, though women with a family history of breast
cancer are at higher risk of getting the disease themselves.
   Lack of communication among physicians involved in a case also
can contribute to delays in diagnosing cancer, ``as each often
thinks the other is the responsible physician,'' the study said.
   The study stressed the importance of self-examination by women,
thorough examinations by a physician and regular mammograms.
   The <ORGANIZATION>American Cancer Society</ORGANIZATION> recommends a mammogram for women at
around age 35 and regular mammograms every one or two years
beginning at age 40 and annually after age 50.
   Among American women, breast cancer is the leading type of
cancer and is second only to lung cancer in cancer deaths.
   The cancer society estimates that breast cancer will be
diagnosed in 142,000 women in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> this year and will
cause 43,000 deaths.

  [Text] <LOCATION>Varanasi</LOCATION>, Jan 28 -- There are about 1.7 million 
cancer patients in <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and about 30,000 to 35,000 people die 
annually from this disease, a medical expert warned today. 
  Dr. <PERSON>S.P. Kohli</PERSON>, Deputy Director General, <ORGANIZATION>Ministry of Health</ORGANIZATION> 
told the first international conference of the <ORGANIZATION>Indian 
Association of Alliative Care</ORGANIZATION> here that cancer is no longer a 
problem of developed countries but a matter of concern for 
developing countries also. 
  She said the problem had acquired greater magnitude due to 
an 
increase in life expectancy resulting in a greater ratio of old 
people in the population, increase in population, improved life 
style as well as modernisation. 
  In <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>, breast, cervix and uterus cancer was most common 
in 
women while men were more prone to mouth, larynx and lung cancer. 
  These types of cancer were tobacco-related and could be 
prevented by proper education, creating awareness and stopping 
tobacco intake. 
  Lung cancer was nearly nine times more common in smokers 
than 
in non-smokers, <PERSON>Dr. Kohli</PERSON> said. 
  Considering this, the <ORGANIZATION>Union Government</ORGANIZATION> had chalked out a 
plan 
of action for prevention of cancer at an early stage, prevention 
of tobacco intake in any form, early diagnosis of cancer 
specially in cervic, breast and mouth. 
  She said that it was most unfortunate that most of the 
cancer 
patients in <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> reported at a very advanced stage in hospitals 
and regional cancer centres, rendering the therapy ineffective. 
  She suggested that since there were more advanced cancer 
cases in <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>, Palliative therapy should be provided to such 
patients effectively. 
  In <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>, <PERCENT>30 percent</PERCENT> of the cancer cases could not be 
treated 
with active therapy and "we could provide only palliative 
therapy in such cases," <PERSON>Dr. Kohli</PERSON> said. 
  Cancer pain is not an imitable part of cancer, contrary to 
common belief. Little is done to alleviate pain simply due to 
inadequacy of medical education in cancer pain therapy, she said. 
  Medical students were taught to treat cancer but not cancer 
pain. She suggested introduction of pain relief and palliative 
care education at undergraduate and post-graduate teaching level. 
  The <ORGANIZATION>Union Government</ORGANIZATION> had started producing oral morphine in 
collaboration with the <ORGANIZATION>World Health Organisation</ORGANIZATION> directly to 10 
identified regional cancer centres. There was a proposal to 
provide oral morphine to other teaching government medical 
institutions, too. 
  She said that morphine was the cheapest and most effective 
pain killer in cancer. Pain could be minimised in 80 to <PERCENT>98 
percent</PERCENT> of cancer cases if right drug in right dose and at right 
time was given, she said.

<HEAD>Cancer Gene Linked To Breast And Lung Cancers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RAEBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Editor</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BAR HARBOR, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A gene found to be defective in a rare
eye cancer has been linked to breast cancer and a common form of
lung cancer, researchers say.
   The gene was the first of a new group of anti-cancer genes that
normally protect against cancer but allow cancer to appear when
defective, said <PERSON>Ray White</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</ORGANIZATION> at
the <ORGANIZATION>University of Utah</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Salt Lake City</LOCATION>.
   Similar anti-cancer genes now have also been linked to colon
cancer, another common and lethal form of cancer.
   The findings that the gene is linked to breast cancer and
so-called small-cell lung cancer suggest that it and other
anti-cancer genes could play a major role in many types of human
cancer, White told genetics students at the <ORGANIZATION>Jackson Laboratory</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Bar Harbor</LOCATION> on <DATE>Monday</DATE>.
   Identifying those genes and determining how they go wrong does
not mean cancer will then be eliminated, <ORGANIZATION>White</ORGANIZATION> said. But the
understanding of these genetic abnormalities is crucial to
ultimately being able to wipe out cancer, he said.
   Over the shorter term, he said, understanding the genetics of
cancer might allow doctors to diagnose subtypes of common cancers
and learn to treat them better.
   The gene was identified in children with a rare eye cancer known
as retinoblastoma. White and <PERSON>Webster Cavenee</PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION>Ludwig
Institute for Cancer Research</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Montreal</LOCATION> were among the scientists
who made that initial discovery and learned how the gene worked.
   Later, those retinoblastoma children were found to develop
osteosarcoma, a bone cancer, also as a result of defects in the
retinoblastoma gene.
   More recently, researchers at the <ORGANIZATION>University of California</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>San
Francisco</LOCATION>, led by <PERSON>Wen-Hwa Lee</PERSON> and <PERSON>Eva Lee</PERSON>, have found that the gene
is defective in certain breast cancer cells grown in the laboratory.
   About the same time, <PERSON>Frederic Kaye</PERSON> and colleagues at the
<ORGANIZATION>National Cancer Institute-Navy Medical Oncology Branch</ORGANIZATION> reported
seeing retinoblastoma gene defects in small-cell lung cancer cells
in the laboratory.
   ``It may well be that the majority of small-cell lung cancers
involve a lesion in the retinoblastoma gene as well as several
others,'' said White.
   Retinoblastoma affects perhaps 1,000 Americans annually, but
small-cell lung cancer strikes 30,000 people in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>
every year, and breast cancer strikes 130,000.
   Suddenly, a gene that was important only in a rare disease is
now seen to be significant in two of the most important and most
devastating human cancers.
   Meanwhile, White had identified a similar anti-cancer gene in a
rare form of inherited colon cancer.
   He said <DATE>Monday</DATE> he has now shown that this anti-cancer gene plays
a role in the much more common non-inherited form of colon cancer
that is another one of the country's leading cancer killers.
   <PERSON>Bert Vogelstein</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Johns Hopkins University School of
Medicine</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION> also has identified several other genetic
defects associated with colon cancer.
   He estimated that perhaps as many as seven genetic defects must
occur for colon cancer to develop. He said he and White have now
identified five of those defects.
   ``You can look at these genetic alterations as the causes of
cancer _ just as you can look at bacteria as the causes of
infection,'' <PERSON>Vogelstein</PERSON> said in a telephone interview. ``Except
it's more complicated in cancer.''

<TEXT>
Striking regional variations are revealed by the first atlas of cancer
incidence in <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Wales</LOCATION>, published yesterday, <PERSON>Clive Cookson</PERSON> writes.
The atlas, commissioned by the <ORGANIZATION>Cancer Research Campaign</ORGANIZATION>, shows that lung
cancer, the most common form of the disease in men, is much more prevalent
in the north than in the south. The reverse is true for breast cancer, the
most common cancer in women.
Dr <PERSON>Isabel Silva</PERSON> and Dr <PERSON>Anthony Swerdlow</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>London School of Hygiene and
Tropical Medicine</ORGANIZATION> analysed information about 3m new cancer patients between
<DATE>1968</DATE> and <DATE>1985</DATE> to give a county-by-county variation in cancer risks. They
compared these with the geographical distributions of risk factors such as
smoking and occupation. The figures in the map above are an index of the
number of new cases in each county over the period.
In some cancers there is an obvious link with risk factors. The north-south
gradient in lung cancer is caused mainly by the greater prevalence of
smoking in the north. The authors say that greater industrial exposures to
smoke, dust and toxic fumes in the north are not sufficient to account for
the regional differences.
Malignant melanoma, the most virulent skin cancer, has a strong south/north
gradient - someone living on the south coast is three times more likely to
suffer than someone in <LOCATION>northern England</LOCATION>. There is a clear correlation with
hours of sunshine.
The reason why breast and ovarian cancers are more common in the south is
not obvious. The fact that southern women have fewer children on average may
be a partial explanation, Drs Silver and <PERSON>Swerdlow</PERSON> say, because they have
higher levels of the hormones related to these cancers.

<HEAD>Radioactive Antibodies Seek and Destroy Cancer Inside the Body</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nuclear-tipped antibodies that seek and
destroy cancer inside the body show promise of giving doctors a new
way to attack tumors, researchers say.
   The goal is to blitz cancer cells with huge doses of killer
radiation. Doctors launch the attack with protein probes that hunt
down the cancer deep within the body.
   In initial experimental use, researchers found that the strategy
wiped out all detectable cancer in people who were not helped by
ordinary treatment. However, far more study will be necessary
before researchers know for sure whether this approach will cure
cancer.
   The findings were presented <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> by <PERSON>Dr. Oliver W. Press</PERSON> of
the <ORGANIZATION>University of Washington</ORGANIZATION> to the annual meeting of the <ORGANIZATION>American
Society of Clinical Oncology</ORGANIZATION>.
   Press is one of several researchers around the country who are
working with radioactive antibodies to combat cancer. However, he
said his group is using the highest doses of radiation yet tried.
   ``We're trying to blast them out of the water,'' he said.
   Antibodies are natural hunters produced by the body to find
germs, cancer and other dangerous invaders. Scientists can now
produce large quantities of antibodies that look for cancer, and
they have fitted them with powerful warheads of radioactive iodine.
   With this strategy, doctors believe they can deliver far higher
doses of radiation than would otherwise be possible and still spare
healthy tissue from harm.
   Press and colleagues have given the treatment to seven people
with the blood cancer lymphoma. All had failed an average of four
kinds of chemotherapy. The treatment wiped out all visible signs of
the cancer in five of them.
   ``The percentage of patients responding is much greater than we
would expect from conventional chemotherapy,'' said <PERSON>Dr. Bruce
Cheson</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>National Cancer Institute</ORGANIZATION>.
   In other research presented at the meeting:
   _<PERSON>Dr. Donald S. Kaufman</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Massachusetts General Hospital</ORGANIZATION>
reported preliminary evidence that a combination of three drugs
followed by radiation can eliminate bladder cancer. If this
approach works out, it would provide an alternative to surgical
removal of the bladder, which is now standard treatment.
   _Many doctors are reluctant to give chemotherapy to women with
early breast cancer, because most can be cured by surgery alone.
<PERSON>Dr. Alexander Paterson</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Cross Cancer Institute</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Edmonton</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Alberta</LOCATION>, has found that those who relapse often carry multiple
copies of an abnormal gene, known as an oncogene, inside their
tumors. Checking for this gene may help doctors target chemotherapy
to those who are most likely to benefit.
   _<PERSON>Dr. Gastan Rivera</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>St. Jude Children's Research Hospital</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Memphis</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Tenn.</LOCATION>, said a review shows that about two-thirds of all
youngsters with acute lymphocytic leukemia, the most common
childhood cancer, can now be cured. He attributed the improved
outlook for this disease, which was once almost uniformly fatal, to
continued improvement in chemotherapy.
   _<PERSON>Dr. James D. Levine</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>New England Deaconess Hospital</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>
said a new treatment can overcome low levels of white blood cells,
which are a common side effect of treatment with the drug AZT in
AIDS patients. The therapy, called granulocyte-macrophage colony
stimulating factor, prompts the body to produce more blood cells.
   _<PERSON>Dr. Gregory Wolf</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>University of Michigan</ORGANIZATION> said a
combination of chemotherapy and radiation shows promise of allowing
doctors to avoid removing the voicebox in victims of advanced
throat cancer. People who received the new treatment appear to have
as good a chance of survival as do surgery patients, and most
retain their ability to speak.
   _<PERSON>Dr. Harinder Garewal</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Veterans Administration Medical
Center</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Tucson</LOCATION> said initial studies suggest that a nutrient
called beta carotene can reverse precancerous growths in the mouth.
This condition, known as oral leukoplakia, is common in smokers.
Many vegetables are high in beta carotene, which the body converts
to vitamin A.

   New Blood Test
   Found to Detect
   Prostate Cancer

   Medical researchers said a new blood test could provide an
effective, widespread method of screening for prostate
cancer, the No. 2 cancer killer of men in the U.S., after
lung cancer.
   In a study, the blood test proved more accurate in
detecting cancer than a rectal examination, the standard
method doctors use to diagnose the disease. In seven out of
10 cases, rectal exams fail to discover the disease until it
has spread to other parts of the body. The blood test
increases the chances of detecting prostate cancer 20%, the
researchers said. In combination with a rectal exam, it
increases the chances 34%.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Moreover, the blood test may make preventive exams much
more common because it is more acceptable to many patients
than rectal exams. Some researchers urge that the blood test
be used for early detection of prostate cancer, much as
mammograms are used to screen for breast cancer in women.
   "It's a valuable new tool for diagnosing prostate cancer,
an area where we're not doing very well," says <PERSON>William J.
Catalona</PERSON>, chief of urologic surgery at <ORGANIZATION>Washington University
School of Medicine</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Barnes Hospital</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>St. Louis</LOCATION>. He says
all men age 50 and over should have annual blood tests to
check for prostate cancer. He and his colleagues report on
the test in today's New England Journal of Medicine.
   But doctors are divided over how effective any broad
screening program might be. It isn't known, for instance,
whether early detection of the disease will lead to
treatments that actually prolong life. Moreover, some studies
based on autopsies show that more than <PERCENT>30%</PERCENT> of men over 50
have evidence of prostate cancer that remains latent and
never causes clinical problems. Some researchers worry that
screening programs might pick up many of these men.
   "The detection of such tumors exposes these patients to
the risks of treatment without any potential for benefit,"
<PERSON>Gerald W. Chodak</PERSON> and <PERSON>Glenn S. Gerber</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>University of
Chicago School of Medicine</ORGANIZATION> said last month in the Journal of
the <ORGANIZATION>National Cancer Institute</ORGANIZATION>.
   About 100,000 cases of prostate cancer are diagnosed in
the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> each year, and about 30,000 men die annually of the
disease. One in 10 men will develop the cancer at some point;
the risk increases with age, and among men with other family
members with the disease. Remedies include surgical removal
of the prostate as well as hormonal and radiation treatments
and chemotherapy.
   One big reason the disease often goes undetected until it
has spread, <PERSON>Dr. Catalona</PERSON> says, is that "most men are
reluctant to have a rectal exam" unless they already have
symptoms. But most people readily accept blood tests for
cholesterol levels, for instance, and he thinks that the
blood test will make preventive exams much more acceptable
for prostate cancer.
   But, he emphasized, "the test is not a substitute -- it
should be used in combination with a rectal exam." Nor is it
perfect. It is only an indicator of problems -- a biopsy is
required to determine whether cancer is present -- and it
misses some abnormalities that show up in rectal exams or
with ultrasound, another diagnostic tool. In the study, it
missed <PERCENT>20%</PERCENT> of the cancers that were present and showed false
positives in <PERCENT>16%</PERCENT> of cases -- a significant error rate that
lends support to those who say the evidence doesn't back up a
broad screening effort.
   Nearly 2,000 men were included in the study, financed in
part by <ORGANIZATION>Hybritech Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, company that
makes the blood test. The test is used to monitor the
progress of prostate cancer, and some doctors already use it
in diagnosis.
   Researchers took blood tests of 1,653 healthy men over 50,
with no evidence of cancer or benign prostate disease, and
measured levels of prostate-specific antigen, or <ORGANIZATION>PSA</ORGANIZATION>, a
protein produced by prostate cells. PSA is produced in
greater quantity as the prostate increases in size,
indicating that cancer may be present. Results were compared
with those for 300 men who had undergone biopsies to examine
abnormal prostate tissue and who served as experimental
controls.
   The researchers found that <PERCENT>92%</PERCENT> of the 1,653 men in the
study had normal <ORGANIZATION>PSA</ORGANIZATION> levels; <PERCENT>6%</PERCENT>, or 107 men, had mildly
elevated levels; and <PERCENT>2%</PERCENT>, or 30, had high levels. Overall, 112
men had biopsies, of whom 37, or <PERCENT>33%</PERCENT> had cancer.
   A high <ORGANIZATION>PSA</ORGANIZATION> level was a major predictor of cancer: <PERCENT>22%</PERCENT> of
men with mildly elevated levels, and <PERCENT>67%</PERCENT> of those with high
levels, had cancer. Men with elevated <ORGANIZATION>PSA</ORGANIZATION> but no cancer had
benign prostate disease or inflammation of the gland.
   The researchers said that among the 37 men with cancer, a
rectal exam alone missed 12, or one-third, of the cancers.
Ultrasound alone missed <PERCENT>43%</PERCENT>, they said.
   The blood test "is not going to detect every prostate
cancer out there," <PERSON>Dr. Catalona</PERSON> said, "but it will be a lot
better than it is now." He said that if widely used, perhaps
seven in 10 cases could be detected before they spread beyond
the prostate itself.
   Though he acknowledged that no study has proved early
detection will prolong life, prostate tumors, like those in
the breast in women, grow relatively slowly -- meaning early
treatment has a chance to be more effective. "Logic tells you
that the reason prostate cancer is a major killer is because
it's picked up late," he says.
   The <ORGANIZATION>National Cancer Institute</ORGANIZATION> plans a major study of the
effectiveness of screening and early treatment, but results
won't be known until late in the next decade.

   Smoking among American men has been dropping
since the early <DATE>1950s</DATE>, but federal researchers say women kept
taking up the habit into the next decade and are now paying the
price with higher rates of lung cancer.
   ``Unless women start quitting in significant numbers, the public

specialist who helped prepare a federal health report on smoking

   The Atlanta-based <ORGANIZATION>Centers for Disease Control</ORGANIZATION> reported <DATE>Thursday</DATE>
that lung cancer deaths increased <PERCENT>15 percent</PERCENT> in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>
between <DATE>1979</DATE> and <DATE>1986</DATE>, to a rate of about 50 deaths per 100,000
people. More men than women die of lung cancer _ about 74 deaths
per 100,000 for males in <DATE>1986</DATE>, compared to 27 per 100,000 for women.
   But the mortality rate from lung cancer among women is soaring
compared to the rate for men. Between <DATE>1979</DATE> and <DATE>1986</DATE>, the lung
cancer death rate for women jumped <PERCENT>44 percent</PERCENT>, while the rate for
men was up just <PERCENT>7 percent</PERCENT>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION> said male smoking has been on the decline since the
early <DATE>1950s</DATE>, but smoking among women peaked at about <DATE>1965</DATE>. The
recent dropoff in smoking among women _ from <PERCENT>32 percent</PERCENT> in <DATE>1965</DATE> to
<PERCENT>27 percent</PERCENT> in <DATE>1987</DATE> studies _ isn't nearly as sharp as the drop in
smoking by men _ from <PERCENT>50 percent</PERCENT> to <PERCENT>32 percent</PERCENT>.
   ``The men are in a very significant downward trend, while the
women _ a lot of them were taking up smoking (in the <DATE>1950s</DATE> and
'60s),'' <PERSON>Sondik</PERSON> said.
   Statistically, the <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION> reported, peaks in smoking seem to be
followed by peaks in lung cancer deaths about 35 years later. More
than eight out of 10 lung cancer deaths are believed to be caused
by smoking.
   ``The burden of lung cancer and other smoking-related chronic
diseases (such as bronchitis and emphysema) will be substantially
higher ... for many decades because of the long latency periods
between exposure to tobacco and onset of these diseases,'' the <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION>
said.
   That, the agency said, means the death rate from lung cancer
among women continues to climb, and will do so until the turn of
the century or possibly longer, assuming the 35-year lag between
peak smoking and peak deaths.
   The <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION> noted that lung cancer already has passed breast cancer
as the most common cause of cancer death among women.
   While almost half of all Americans who ever took up smoking have
quit, the <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION> said, more than 50 million people in the <LOCATION>United
States</LOCATION> continue to smoke.
   In <DATE>1986</DATE>, the last year statistics are available, 85,050 men died
of lung cancer in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, compared to 40,461 women, the
<ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION> said. Nearly two-thirds of those deaths were people over 65.
   The lung cancer death rates are about the same for white females
and black females _ 27.4 per 100,000 for white women and 26.4 for
black women in <DATE>1986</DATE>. The death rate among males, however, is higher
for blacks, 98.4 to 72.3.
   The highest lung cancer death rate among the states in <DATE>1986</DATE> was
in <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION>, with 148 such deaths for a rate of 70.5 per 100,000
people. The lowest was in <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION>, with 275 such deaths, or a rate of
24.3.

   The number of older women getting mammograms
increased noticeably after <PERSON>Nancy Reagan</PERSON>'s breast cancer diagnosis,
researchers said <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   A survey taken in 33 states by the <ORGANIZATION>Centers for Disease Control</ORGANIZATION>
found that <PERCENT>38 percent</PERCENT> of women age 50 and up questioned in <DATE>November</DATE>
and <DATE>December 1987</DATE> said they had received a screening mammogram for
breast cancer within the previous year.
   That was up nearly half again from the <PERCENT>26 percent</PERCENT> the survey
found in the first two months of that year.
   <PERSON>Mrs. Reagan</PERSON>'s diagnosis for breast cancer occurred in <DATE>October
1987</DATE> when she was first lady. It was one of two events that directed
public attention to the disease that year. In <DATE>March, April</DATE> and <DATE>May</DATE>
the <ORGANIZATION>American Cancer Society</ORGANIZATION> conducted a media campaign to promote
screening for breast cancer.
   ``The percentage of women who reported being screened increased
coincident with the <ORGANIZATION>ACS</ORGANIZATION> ... campaign and again after the diagnosis
of <PERSON>Mrs. Reagan</PERSON>'s breast cancer,'' the <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION> said.
   Data from the <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION> survey ``suggest that the media events and
educational activities were accompanied by increases in screening
mammograms,'' the agency said. It acknowledged there was no
statistical proof of cause and effect.
   The survey did not include women who had mammograms because of a
specific health problem or history, or those who hadn't seen a
doctor for a routine examination at all.
   Medical centers in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> reported after <PERSON>Mrs. Reagan</PERSON>'s
diagnosis that the demand for mammograms had gone up. She later was
honored with an <ORGANIZATION>American Cancer Society Courage Award</ORGANIZATION> for
encouraging women to check for breast cancer.
   The <ORGANIZATION>ACS</ORGANIZATION> recommends that all women 50 or older have a mammogram
each year, but studies have found that most women in that group have
never had a mammogram.
   Cancer specialists at the <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION> and elsewhere say increased use of
mammograms would increase early detection of breast cancer, raising
survival rates for patients.
   The cancer society recommends that women between 35 and 40 have
one initial mammogram, and that women 40-49 have one each year or
two.
   Breast cancer, second to lung cancer as a cause of cancer deaths
among women, kills about 40,000 <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> women each year.

A LOOK AT THE ENEMY: CANCER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
THE DISEASE 
</P>
<P>
There are more than 100 types of cancer. Most fall into two categories: 
sarcomas or carcinomas. 
</P>
<P>
Carcinomas are cancers of the type of tissue that forms skin and the lining of 
major organs. <PERCENT>Eighty percent</PERCENT> to <PERCENT>90%</PERCENT> of all cancers are carcinomas. 
</P>
<P>
Sarcomas are cancers of the connective tissue, such as bone and cartilage. 
</P>
<P>
Cancer cells differ from normal cells in three main ways: They reproduce 
faster, migrate to other parts of the body and don't have specialized 
functions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE NUMBERS 
</P>
<P>
A little more than 1 million Americans will be found to have cancer this year. 
About half a million will die from it. 
</P>
<P>
For all cancers combined, the number of new cases each year increased <PERCENT>10.7%</PERCENT> 
between <DATE>1973</DATE> and <DATE>1985</DATE>, the latest year for which statistics are available. 
</P>
<P>
The most dramatic increase between <DATE>1973</DATE> and <DATE>1985</DATE> was for melanoma of the skin, 
which increased <PERCENT>60%</PERCENT>. Excessive sun exposure is the primary cause. 
</P>
<P>
The greatest decline between <DATE>1973</DATE> and <DATE>1985</DATE> was for cervical cancer, which 
dropped <PERCENT>35%</PERCENT>. Early detection and greater use of <ORGANIZATION>Pap</ORGANIZATION> smears are credited. 
</P>
<P>
Lung cancer is the most common form of cancer in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and the 
major cause of cancer death. Most lung cancer is caused by cigarette smoking. 
Among women, lung cancer incidence increased <PERCENT>81%</PERCENT> between <DATE>1973</DATE> and <DATE>1985</DATE>. For 
men, it increased <PERCENT>14.3%</PERCENT>. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE SURVIVAL RATE 
</P>
<P>
The rate of people who survive cancer and are disease-free five years after the 
diagnosis is now about <PERCENT>50%</PERCENT>. Cancers with higher survivability rates are: 
testis, <PERCENT>90%</PERCENT>; colon, <PERCENT>54%</PERCENT>, and breast, <PERCENT>74%</PERCENT>. Cancers with lower rates are: 
leukemia, <PERCENT>31%</PERCENT>; lung, <PERCENT>13%</PERCENT>, and stomach, <PERCENT>16%</PERCENT>. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE COSTS 
</P>
<P>
Taking into account hospital costs, the loss of job productivity and the loss 
of employable years, cancer costs about <MONEY>$72 billion</MONEY> a year in the <LOCATION>United 
States</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Cancer accounts for about <PERCENT>10%</PERCENT> of the cost of all disease in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
On average, the person who dies from cancer dies 15 years earlier than his or 
her normal life expectancy. Lung cancer accounts for a loss of about 1.8 
million years of life every year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE RECENT BREAKTHROUGHS 
</P>
<P>
The discovery of oncogenes has probably been the most important cancer research 
discovery in the past two decades. Oncogenes are abnormal genes that appear to 
be capable of "ordering" a cell to become a cancer cell. Although scientists 
have identified about 20 human oncogenes, they have yet to unravel the 
mysteries of the how the "ordering" occurs. 
</P>
<P>
The discovery of substances called anti-oncogenes may prove to be equally 
important. Anti-oncogenes are substances that somehow "turn off" cancer cells 
and transform them back to normal cells. (Proteoglycans, the substance that the 
<ORGANIZATION>La Jolla Cancer Research Foundation</ORGANIZATION> is working with, is an anti-oncogene.) 
Research on anti-oncogenes is at an early stage and the potential for use in 
treatment is unknown. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the recent progress in research can be credited to the discovery of 
monoclonal antibodies, genetically engineered antibodies that can be created in 
great quantities in the laboratory. The human immune system creates many kinds 
of natural antibodies to foreign proteins, such as viruses. Some natural 
antibodies may neutralize the proteins; others may not. In contrast, monoclonal 
antibodies are designed to seek out and attack specific proteins. They have 
become an important tool for isolating and identifying specific cell parts and 
cell mechanisms. They are used to a limited degree as diagnostic tools. 
Scientists are also working to couple monoclonal antibodies with 
cancer-fighting drugs to more effectively target treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Progress has been made with conventional cancer treatments, particularly in the 
area of chemotherapy. Doctors now know that combinations of certain drugs can 
effectively treat some types of leukemia that previously would not respond well 
to any single drug. New methods of delivering anti-cancer drugs also have been 
developed that have proved more effective. At <ORGANIZATION>UC San Diego Cancer Center</ORGANIZATION>, an 
experimental treatment for ovarian cancer has shown promise. It involves 
administering high concentrations of cancer drugs through an abdominal catheter 
and applying more directly greater doses of drugs than standard intravenous 
treatment currently allows

   <PERSON>Nancy Reagan</PERSON>'s triumph over breast cancer and a
publicity campaign about the disease may have sent thousands of
women to their doctors for potentially life-saving mammograms,
federal health officials reported.
   A survey of health behavior in 33 states by the <ORGANIZATION>Centers for
Disease Control</ORGANIZATION> found that <PERCENT>38 percent</PERCENT> of women age 50 and older
questioned in <DATE>November</DATE> and <DATE>December 1987</DATE> said they had received a
mammogram for breast cancer within a year.
   Those findings, shortly after the then first lady's <DATE>October</DATE>
diagnosis, marked an increase of nearly <PERCENT>50 percent</PERCENT> over the <PERCENT>26
percent</PERCENT> the survey found in the first two months of that year.
   Medical centers in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> reported after <PERSON>Mrs. Reagan</PERSON>'s
diagnosis that the demand for mammograms had gone up. She was later
honored with an <ORGANIZATION>American Cancer Society</ORGANIZATION> award for her efforts to
encourage women to check for breast cancer.
   A springtime media campaign by the cancer society promoted
screening for breast cancer, and data from the survey ``suggest that
the media events and educational activities were accompanied by
increases in screening mammograms,'' the <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION> said.
   The increases in mammograms ``may be related to enhanced public
awareness during the <ORGANIZATION>ACS</ORGANIZATION> spring campaign and after <PERSON>Mrs. Reagan</PERSON>'s
diagnosis,'' the <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION> said, although the agency added that the data
cannot directly prove such a connection statistically.
   The cancer society recommends that all women 50 or older have a
mammogram each year.
   Overall, in the <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION>'s <DATE>1987</DATE> behavioral risk factor survey, <PERCENT>29
percent</PERCENT> of the women 50 and up said they had been screened for
breast cancer in the preceding 12 months.
   The survey excluded women who had mammograms because of a
specific health problem or history, or those who hadn't seen a
doctor for a routine examination at all.
   Other studies also have found that most American women 50 or
older have never had a mammogram, despite recommendations that they
should. Cancer specialists at the <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION> and elsewhere say increased
use of mammograms would increase early detection of breast cancer,
raising survival rates for patients.
   Aside from annual mammograms for women 50 and up, the <ORGANIZATION>American
Cancer Society</ORGANIZATION> recommends that women between 35 and 40 have one
initial mammogram, and that women 40-49 have one each year or two.
   Breast cancer, second to lung cancer as a cause of cancer deaths
among women, kills about 40,000 <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> women each year.

<TEXT>
   A genetic abnormality that appears to play a
role in many common cancers has been solidly linked to lung cancer,
raising hopes of improved diagnosis and treatment, scientists say.
   Researchers examining lung cancer tumors discovered a series of
abnormalities in the so-called p53 anti-cancer gene, according to a
report <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> by <PERSON>Dr. John Minna</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>National Cancer
Institute-Navy Medical Oncology Branch</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Bethesda</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Md</LOCATION>.
   Defects in the gene also have been linked to colon cancer, to an
uncommon bone cancer called osteogenic sarcoma and to chronic
myelogenous leukemia, <PERSON>Minna</PERSON> said.
   ``Obviously, everybody is going to be looking for it in
everything else,'' <PERSON>Minna</PERSON> said.
   <PERSON>Bert Vogelstein</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Johns Hopkins University</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION>, who
identified p53 abnormalities in colon cancer, said: ``From what
I've heard of <PERSON>Dr. Minna</PERSON>'s work, it seems quite clear that the p53
gene will play an important role in lung tumors.
   ``Current evidence suggests that p53 is likely to play a role in
many common cancers,'' including breast cancer, ovarian cancer and
bladder cancer, he said.
   During the past few years, researchers have found indirect
evidence that defects in at least six genes can contribute to lung
cancer, which afflicts an estimated 150,000 Americans a year.
   The new study has pinpointed chemical changes in one of those
genes. That should be useful for identifying people at high risk of
getting lung cancer, or for predicting how deadly a particular case
of lung cancer will be, <PERSON>Minna</PERSON> said.
   ``One thing you could do would be to take people's tumors, see
how many (genetic) lesions they have, and determine how virulent
they are,'' <PERSON>Minna</PERSON> said <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> in a telephone interview from
<LOCATION>Toronto</LOCATION>, where he presented his findings at the <ORGANIZATION>Bristol-Myers
Cancer Research Symposium</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>Vogelstein</PERSON> has found that the more genetic abnormalities a colon
cancer tumor has, the more virulent it is, <PERSON>Minna</PERSON> said.
   <PERSON>Minna</PERSON> said he is beginning studies to determine if the same
thing is true in lung cancer.
   Determination of a tumor's virulence could lead to better
decisions on treatment, he said.
   Minna also said screening for genetic abnormalities in people
who don't have lung cancer could reveal those who are about to get
cancer _ that is, people who have some, but not all, of the genetic
changes needed to produce a tumor. Such people could be followed
closely for the appearance of tumors, he said.
   The protein made by the p53 gene, located on chromosome 17,
normally protects the body against cancer. If the protein is
defective, the protective effect is lost and one step has been
taken toward the formation of a tumor, <PERSON>Minna</PERSON> explained. The gene is
called an anti-cancer gene because it normally protects against
cancer.
   <PERSON>Minna</PERSON> said that although only six genetic abnormalities have so
far been linked to lung cancer, there may be as many as 10 or 20.
   Most of the evidence for the six abnormalities already found
consists of studies with genetic ``signposts'' called restriction
fragment length polymorphisms. These studies show the approximate
location of the abnormalities on chromosomes, but do not reveal
precisely what the abnormalities are.
   The p53 gene is the second anti-cancer gene to be carefully
studied, <PERSON>Minna</PERSON> said. The first was a gene identified in
retinoblastoma, a rare children's eye cancer. The retinoblastoma
gene also was shown recently to be important in lung cancer, <PERSON>Minna</PERSON>
said.

FT  06 APR 94 / Trials of bowel cancer vaccine 'impressive'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British scientists have developed an experimental vaccine for bowel cancer,
the second most common cause of cancer deaths in industrialised countries.
It is being tested first as a potential treatment for patients with advanced
cancer but could be used eventually as a preventive vaccine for people known
to be genetically at risk from colo-rectal (bowel) cancer.
The <ORGANIZATION>Cancer Research Campaign</ORGANIZATION>, which funded the vaccine's development at
<ORGANIZATION>Nottingham University</ORGANIZATION>, said yesterday: 'The first clinical trials indicate
impressive results in patients.'
<ORGANIZATION>ImClone Systems</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> biotechnology company, has signed an exclusive
worldwide licensing agreement with the <ORGANIZATION>CRC</ORGANIZATION> for commercial development of
Vaccine 105AD7, as it is known. <ORGANIZATION>ImClone</ORGANIZATION> is a leader in the fast-growing
research field of cancer vaccines; it is also testing vaccines for lung
cancer and melanoma.
Dr <PERSON>Lindy Durrant</PERSON> and Dr <PERSON>Adrian Robbins</PERSON>, who developed 105AD7 at <LOCATION>Nottingham</LOCATION>,
said it not only had the potential to prevent bowel cancer or stop the
disease progressing, but also had the advantage of producing no toxic
side-effects - unlike conventional treatments.
The encouraging first results came from tests on a dozen patients with
advanced bowel cancer; they will be published next week. The <ORGANIZATION>CRC</ORGANIZATION> is now
organising a larger clinical trial, based at <LOCATION>Nottingham</LOCATION>, with 350 patients,
and <ORGANIZATION>ImClone</ORGANIZATION> will carry out an extensive trial in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>.
Even if the new vaccine continues to perform well, it is unlikely to be
approved as a commercial treatment of bowel cancer before <DATE>1997</DATE>. Its use in
preventive vaccination might then follow four years later.
There are several ways in which researchers are planning to use vaccines to
prevent cancer. One is the indirect approach - immunising people against
viruses, such as <PERSON>Epstein Barr</PERSON>, which are associated with certain cancers.
The CRC-ImClone approach, on the other hand, is aimed directly at tumour
cells. Vaccine 105AD7 is designed to mimic a particular part of the cell
surface.
This primes the patient's immune system to recognise and attack the cancer
cells themselves.
Every year more than 28,000 people in the UK are diagnosed as having bowel
cancer. Only 9,000 will be alive <DATE>five years later</DATE>. In the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>, the disease
kills 55,000 people a year.
'Bowel cancer is the second most common cause of cancer death in the west,'
said <PERSON>Prof Gordon McVie</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>CRC</ORGANIZATION> scientific director.

<P>
A federal advisory panel recommended <DATE>Friday</DATE> that the <ORGANIZATION>Food and Drug 
Administration</ORGANIZATION> reject a proposal to undertake a ground-breaking U.S.-Soviet 
study of 20,000 women to determine whether a hormonal drug can prevent breast 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>FDA</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Oncology Drugs Advisory Committee</ORGANIZATION> agreed that a long-term study 
should be conducted to determine the effect of the hormonal drug tamoxifen in 
preventing breast cancer and other cancers in healthy women. 
</P>
<P>
But the panel said that its members had concluded that the design of the 
proposed 10-year, <MONEY>$100-million</MONEY> study of women in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and the 
<LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> was flawed. The committee said that it would recommend ways to 
correct the deficiencies. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm disappointed for the women of the country," said <PERSON>Phillip D. Bretz</PERSON>, 
director of the <ORGANIZATION>Desert Breast Institute in Rancho Mirage</ORGANIZATION> and one of the 
proposed study leaders. "I felt it was time to do it. None of these answers are 
going to be resolved until this study is done." 
</P>
<P>
Although the recommendation of an <ORGANIZATION>FDA</ORGANIZATION> advisory committee is not binding, it 
typically wields considerable weight in agency decision-making. The <ORGANIZATION>FDA</ORGANIZATION> must 
approve the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> segment of the study before it can begin. 
</P>
<P>
The committee said there was insufficient information on how the study would be 
conducted, including recruitment of patients and handling of data. Some members 
also expressed concern that the volunteers would not be at high enough risk for 
breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Bretz</PERSON>, however, said that the study was rejected because he did not have the 
academic ties of traditional researchers. He said that he would revise his 
study proposal in an effort to satisfy the committee's demands. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed study, endorsed by American and Soviet cancer specialists in 
<DATE>March</DATE>, would involve administration of tamoxifen, an anti-estrogen drug already 
widely used in post-surgical breast cancer therapy, to women considered at high 
risk for breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
It would be the first large-scale study undertaken jointly in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> 
and <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>, its sponsors said. The pool of participants, about 10,000 
from each country, would consist primarily of daughters, sisters or mothers of 
women who have had breast cancer and who are considered at high risk of 
developing the disease themselves. Half of the women would be given a medically 
worthless placebo for comparison purposes. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers had predicted a <PERCENT>25%</PERCENT> reduction in the incidence of breast cancer 
among the women who were given the drug. 
</P>
<P>
The study would be coordinated by <PERSON>Bretz</PERSON>; <PERSON>Dr. Philip B. Dreisbach</PERSON>, of the 
<ORGANIZATION>Eisenhower Medical Center</ORGANIZATION> in Rancho Mirage, and <PERSON>Dr. David Zaridze</PERSON>, deputy 
director of the <ORGANIZATION>All-Union Cancer Research Institute</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The study was opposed by some women's health advocacy groups, who said it is 
dangerous to experiment with drugs on healthy women. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a drug that is not risk-free," said <PERSON>Cindy Pearson</PERSON>, program director of 
the <ORGANIZATION>National Women's Health Network</ORGANIZATION>. "It's a fine drug for a breast cancer 
patient -- a woman facing the possibility of death is more than willing to take 
a drug that has some risk. But to jump from a drug that's effective in a group 
with a life-threatening disease to a huge trial in healthy women is crazy." 
</P>
<P>
But <PERSON>Dr. Wendy Schain</PERSON>, a psychologist with <ORGANIZATION>Memorial Cancer Institute</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Long 
Beach</LOCATION> and a former breast cancer patient, recommended approval of the study. 
"This is the best we've got," she said. "We need to get these answers. We have 
no better way to get them." 
</P>

<HL> Gene Causing Childhood Eye Tumor Linked in Study to Adult Lung Cancer </HL>

   Researchers studying the gene that causes retinoblastoma, a rare childhood eye tumor, discovered a surprising link between the gene and small-cell lung cancer, a malignancy that afflicts smokers. 

   The study suggests that the eye-cancer oncogene plays a role in the genesis of the adult malignancy that affects about 25,000 to 30,000 people a year, one-fourth of all lung-cancer cases. 
Moreover, some scientists speculate that the link to the gene may supply a potential reason why some smokers get the cancer and some do not. 

   The study, which appears in today's edition of the journal Science, is by <PERSON>J. William Harbour</PERSON> and <PERSON>Frederic J. Kaye</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>National Cancer Institute</ORGANIZATION>, with colleagues <PERSON>Shinn-Liang Lai</PERSON>, <PERSON>Jacqueline Whang-Peng</PERSON>, <PERSON>Adi F. Gazdar</PERSON> and <PERSON>John D. Minna</PERSON>. 

   Oncogenes are genes or hereditary units with the potential to cause normal cells to turn cancerous. 
The retinoblastoma, or Rb, gene, located on chromosome 13, is a "recessive oncogene," which means that it triggers cancer only when it is damaged or inactivated. 
Other oncogenes, such as those in the myc family, also implicated in small-cell lung cancer, cause cancer when they are hyperactive or overexpressed. 

   The study in Science found that the Rb gene was structurally damaged in <PERCENT>18%</PERCENT> of small-cell lung cancer cell lines, and nonfunctional in a startling <PERCENT>60%</PERCENT> of the cell lines. 
In contrast, the gene was found to be intact in <PERCENT>90%</PERCENT> of other types lung cancer, as well as in normal lung tissue. 

   Many mysteries persist about the two previously unrelated tumors. 
Retinoblastoma, while very rare, is hereditary and occurs in familial patterns in <PERCENT>40%</PERCENT> of all cases. 
Yet small-cell lung cancer has no clear family pattern, and doesn't coincide with retinoblastoma, either within families or in the same patient. 
Still, the two share certain similarities; for example, both are hormone-secreting tumors. 

   What is most intriguing to many is the link between the environmental and genetic roots in small-cell lung cancer, a virulent killer. 
<PERSON>Dr. Minna</PERSON>, a co-author of the paper, said the work contributes to the "two-hit" theory of lung cancer. 
"It is possible that one hit could come from your parents," he said, in the form of the gene, "and that a second hit from smoking, or from living in a house with high radon." 
The paper suggests smoking may supply the necessary damage to the Rb gene that unleashes cancer. 

   "Small-cell lung cancer is closely associated with heavy cigarette smoking, and carcinogen exposure from tobacco may generate an increased mutation rate in the bronchial epithelium," or lining of the lung, the paper said. 
The Rb gene, a large gene, may be especially susceptible to mutation and thus may commonly become damaged in the lungs of cigarette smokers. 

   Moreover, the Rb gene is now a suspect in several cancers. 
<PERSON>Eva Lee</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>University of California</ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>, author of a study on Rb and breast cancer, called the cancer institute study "important" in further understanding the oncogene's role. 
"Since cloning of the gene, we have been able to look into other tumors," she said. 
"It is now clear Rb is involved not only in retinoblastoma, but also in osteosarcoma (a bone tumor), lung cancer and breast cancer." 

   While it will be years before the study yields practical results, such work contributes to the belief that it may one day be possible to screen people for genetic susceptibility to certain tumors, and thus to warn them to avoid the carcinogens that take advantage of their vulnerability.

<HEAD>Inherited Mutation Called Related to Breast Cancer in Some
Families</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An abnormal gene found in some families can
lead to a high susceptibility to breast cancer, according to a
study published today.
   The finding is a major step that puts researchers closer to
understanding the inherited tendency to develop malignancies, says
study in the journal Science.
   The inherited genetic mutation was discovered by studying the
genes in a small group of families that experience in generation
after generation of an exceptionally high rate of six types of
cancer, including breast cancer.
   ``Up until now there have been no inherited genes isolated and
identified which provided susceptibilities to some of the common
adult malignancies,'' said <PERSON>Dr. Stephen Friend</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Massachusetts
General Hospital Cancer Center</ORGANIZATION>.
   Scientists have long questioned whether a single mutation in a
single inherited gene could advance the tendency to develop cancer.
Friend said the study settles that question.
   ``This shows that the answer is yes,'' said Friend. ``If you are
born with an inactive region in one gene, then that gives you a
hidden susceptibility to malignancies.''
   Although the breast cancer is the most common disease related to
the mutated gene, Friend said it is not the only genetic cause of
breast cancer.
   ``There are multiple genes for breast cancer,'' he said. ``This
happens to be the first, but it won't be the last.''
   Female breast cancer strikes about 130,000 American women
annually and kills about 41,000. Friend said that ``it is unclear
at this time which of those many women have the ... mutation.''
   Friend, who was lead author of the study, said the mutation was
found on what is called the p53 cancer suppressor gene. For people
who inherit a mutated p53 gene, he said, ``their chance of getting
a malignancy by age 60 is <PERCENT>90 percent</PERCENT>.''
   Dr. <PERSON>Andrew Feinberg</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>University of Michigan Cancer Center</ORGANIZATION>
researcher and co-discoverer of genes related to a rare kidney
cancer, said the p53 discovery adds a step in the cascade of cell
changes that is thought to lead to some cancers.
   ``From a scientific viewpoint, it is very important because it
helps us understand the sequence of events that lead to cancer,''
said <PERSON>Feinberg</PERSON>. However, he emphasized that there are a number of
other steps, still unknown, that cause a normal cell to become
cancerous.
   The p53 gene is one of a group of genes that control cell
growth. The gene, in effect, blocks the uncontrolled division of
cells, hence, suppresses tumor development. If this function is
lost through mutation, then the cell lacks one of the controls that
keep division in balance.
   The mutated p53 gene has been detected in the past in a number
of types of cancers, but the new study is the first to find that
the mutation can be inherited.
   Inherited gene mutations have been related in earlier studies to
rare eye and kidney cancers.
   Friend said he and his colleagues isolated the specific p53 gene
mutation by studying people with what is called the Li-Fraumeni
syndrome. These are families in which there is an inherited
tendency to develop one of six types of cancer at an early age,
often during childhood.
   Breast cancer is the most common malignancy among Li-Fraumeni
families, but they also can develop leukemias, brain tumors,
sarcomas of the bone and cancer of the adrenal gland.
   The researchers discovered the mutation in the cells of
Li-Fraumeni family members who had cancer, but not in those family
members who were free of the disease.
   Friend said that in the affected family members the p53 mutation
was found in every cell, indicating it was passed genetically from
one generation to another.
   The Li-Fraumeni syndrome was first described by <PERSON>Frederick P. Li</PERSON>
and <PERSON>Joseph F. Fraumeni Jr.</PERSON>, both of the <ORGANIZATION>National Cancer Institute</ORGANIZATION>
and coauthors of the study in Science. The syndrome is very rare,
with only about 200 such families in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>.
   With discovery of the p53 mutation, <ORGANIZATION>Friend</ORGANIZATION> said a screening
process may be developed to determine which members in a
Li-Fraumeni family have inherited the abnormal gene. When one
parent in a family has the mutation, there is a 50-50 chance that
each child will inherit it.
   Children that show the mutation, said Friend, could then undergo
periodic, intensified examinations for cancer so that the
malignancies they will almost certainly develop could be found very
early.

   Scientists said they found evidence of a gene that may
render women more susceptible to developing breast cancer,
particularly after exposure to diagnostic X-rays.
   Until a test is developed that can identify the one
million or more women who have the A-T gene, as it is known,
it would be prudent for physicians to minimize the use of
diagnostic tests that expose the female breast to X-rays, the
scientists cautioned. They urged physicians to use ultrasound
or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) diagnostic tests instead
of X-rays whenever possible.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The researchers estimated that of the 176,000 women who
develop breast cancer each year, between <PERCENT>7%</PERCENT> and <PERCENT>14%</PERCENT> may be
carrying the A-T gene.
   The new finding is likely to heighten the debate over
whether women younger than 50 years of age should undergo
periodic mammographic examinations that involve exposing the
breast to weak or "soft" X-rays. Since breast cancer is less
common among younger women, various medical groups have
argued heatedly whether the mammography uncovers enough
curable breast cancers to outweigh the possibility that the
X-rays might induce some new breast cancers.
   The new finding, however, isn't likely to change
prevailing medical opinion that periodic mammography for
women over 50 years of age pays off. Repeated studies of this
age group, where breast cancer is most common, show that
periodic mammograms detect enough breast cancers at a curable
stage to extend the average life expectancy of older women.
   However, "We would like to see all older mammography
machines that give higher doses of radiation retired
immediately" in favor of newer, low-dose machines, said
medical geneticist <PERSON>Michael Swift</PERSON> who headed the <ORGANIZATION>University of
North Carolina-Chapel Hill</ORGANIZATION> team that reported the new finding
in this week's <ORGANIZATION>New England Journal of Medicine</ORGANIZATION>.
   The A-T gene is so named because people who are unlucky
enough to inherit two copies of the gene, one from each
parent, develop a rare disease called ataxia-telangiectasia.
The disease affects the immune system but involves such
symptoms as stumbling and uncoordinated movements (ataxia)
and red splotches on the skin (telangiectasia).
   A-T patients also are 61 to 184 times more likely to
develop cancer than those in the general population. In light
of this fact, the <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION> researchers launched an
effort to see if having a single copy of the gene also
boosted the risk of developing cancer, as some previous
studies had hinted.
   In <DATE>1982</DATE> the researchers began following the lives and
deaths of 1,599 adult blood relatives of 161 families in
which at least one person had been born with
ataxia-telangiectasia. The prevalence of people carrying a
single copy of the A-T gene would be far higher among blood
relatives of such patients than among the general population.
   Among these blood relatives, it was fairly certain that
294 possessed one copy of the A-T gene because of their
geneological relationship with an A-T patient. It was
presumed that other blood relatives probably possessed one
copy of the gene but their position in the family tree
couldn't distinguish them.
   The researchers found that within five years 18 new
cancers developed among those known to have one copy of the
A-T gene. Statisticians calculated that possessing a single
copy of the gene boosted the risk of cancer by 3.8-fold for
men and 3.5-fold for women over the risk of the general
population.
   Of the 18 cancers, the most common was breast cancer, of
which there were five cases. This indicated that the single
A-T gene boosted the risk of breast cancer by fivefold.
   Not all the women who carried a single copy of the A-T
gene developed breast cancer, or any cancer, the researchers
noted. This indicated that while the gene may render the
women susceptible to cancer some environmental agent has to
strike to actually cause the cancer.
   To find the environmental trigger of breast cancer, the
researchers looked into the medical backgrounds of 19 female
blood relatives who had developed breast cancer. Ten of them,
or more than half, had had chest or abdominal exposures to
X-rays for either medical or occupational reasons. In
contrast, only <PERCENT>19%</PERCENT> of a group of "control" women of similar
age and background, who were being monitored simultaneously,
had been exposed to such X-rays.
   The data "are consistent with a fivefold to sixfold excess
risk of breast cancer among blood relatives" of A-T patients
who have had single or multiple X-ray examinations of the
chest or abdomen, <PERSON>Dr. Swift</PERSON> and his colleagues concluded.
   They noted that <PERCENT>1.4%</PERCENT> of the population may unwittingly
harbor a single copy of the A-T gene but that a test to
detect it isn't yet available. "Until that is possible it may
be prudent to take into account the <PERCENT>1%</PERCENT> chance that anyone"
can possess a single A-T gene "and to take the most stringent
measures possible to minimize incidental diagnostic X-ray
exposure of the female breast," they said.

<LEADPARA>  One in nine American women now can expect to develop breast cancer at some
time in their lives, continuing a steady increase in the risk women face,
according to the American Cancer Society.;    The society has been saying
since 1987 that the average American woman faced a 1-in-10 chance of
developing breast cancer. It revised the risk upward Thursday to reflect an
increase in the reported incidence of breast cancer in the 1980s, in part
because of better detection methods and the fact that women are living longer.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  ONE IN NINE WOMEN LIKELY TO GET BREAST CANCER
AS LIFESPANS INCREASE, SO DOES DISEASE  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Since <DATE>1980</DATE>, the society said, reported cases of breast cancer in the <LOCATION>United
States</LOCATION> have increased more than <PERCENT>30 percent</PERCENT>, making it the most common cancer,
excluding those of the skin. It is the second leading cancer killer for women,
surpassed only by lung cancer.;    About 175,000 American women will develop
breast cancer this year and nearly 45,000 women will die from the disease,
according to the <ORGANIZATION>Cancer Society</ORGANIZATION>'s annual projections.;    "This increase in
incidence represents frightening prospects for American women," <PERSON>Dr. Stephen
Weiss</PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION>Cancer Society</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> division, said at a news
conference called to announce the new statistics.;    <PERSON>Lawrence Garfinkel</PERSON>, a
senior consultant in epidemiology and statistics for the <ORGANIZATION>Cancer Society</ORGANIZATION>, said
the rise in breast cancer rates during the last decade was in part because of
an increased use of mammography, which has meant that more cases are detected.
But he said better detection and the already known risk factors for breast
cancer could not account entirely for the increased incidence.;    "I think
there is another factor we really haven't been able to identify," he said,
"because I don't think the factors we can identify can account for all this.";
   <PERSON>Garfinkel</PERSON> said he expected that by the time <DATE>1990</DATE> breast cancer figures were
analyzed, a woman's chances for getting breast cancer would be one in eight.
The one-in-nine risk is based on <DATE>1987</DATE> breast cancer figures.;    <PERSON>Edward
Sondik</PERSON>, an official at the <ORGANIZATION>National Cancer Institute</ORGANIZATION>, said <DATE>Thursday</DATE> that the
increased risk for breast cancer calculated by the <ORGANIZATION>Cancer Society</ORGANIZATION> showed that
"basically people are living longer, and if people live longer, the risk of
disease goes up.";    <PERSON>Sondik</PERSON> said greater use of mammograms, or breast X-rays,
accounted for most of the increase because detection is made easier.;   
"(Other) factors that have been identified are later childbearing, diet, use
of estrogen, but no one has been able to prove the actual increases we are
seeing are related to these factors," said <PERSON>Sondik</PERSON>, who is deputy director of
the institute's division of cancer prevention and control.;    The Cancer
Society's latest cancer statistics are bound to provide more ammunition for
women's advocacy and health groups, which are becoming increasingly vocal in
their demands that the government spend more for breast cancer research.;   
<ORGANIZATION>The National Cancer Institute</ORGANIZATION> will spend about <MONEY>$90 million</MONEY> on breast cancer
research this year -- up from <MONEY>$81 million</MONEY> in <DATE>1990</DATE>. Advocacy groups argue that
that amount is just a fraction of the more than <MONEY>$1 billion</MONEY> spent on AIDS
research <DATE>last year.</DATE>;    There are some acknowledged risk factors for breast
cancer, including having a family history of the disease, delaying
childbearing until after age 30 and having an early onset of menstruation or
late onset of menopause. However, studies to pinpoint other risk factors --
such as birth control pills and estrogen replacement therapy -- have produced
confusing and sometimes conflicting information.  </TEXT>

   Researchers at the <ORGANIZATION>Pittsburgh Cancer Institute</ORGANIZATION>
will conduct a five-year study of the rate at which some people who
receive transplanted organs develop cancer.
   In the process, the <MONEY>$5 million</MONEY> study _ funded by the <ORGANIZATION>National
Cancer Institute _</ORGANIZATION> may provide clues to the relationship between
cancer and viruses and the way in which the body combats those
diseases, one official said <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
   ``It has broad implications for better understanding of
mechanisms that lead to the development of cancer,'' said <PERSON>Dr.
Theresa Whiteside</PERSON>, director of the institute's immunologic
monitoring and diagnostic laboratory and a professor of pathology
at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Pittsburgh</ORGANIZATION>.
   About 400 adults and children who have received transplants will
be recruited to participate in the study.
   <PERSON>Whiteside</PERSON> said one of the most significant aspects of the study
is that researchers will be able to study a large group of people,
some of whom they know will develop cancer.
   It will build on observations made in <DATE>1975</DATE> by <LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION> liver
transplant pioneer <PERSON>Dr. Thomas Starzl</PERSON>, who discovered when he was at
the <ORGANIZATION>University of Colorado</ORGANIZATION> that 2 to <PERCENT>3 percent</PERCENT> of all transplant
recipients developed cancer.
   The most common malignancies diagnosed among those patients were
lymph node cancer, liver cancer and <ORGANIZATION>Kaposi</ORGANIZATION>'s sarcoma, a skin cancer
also common among AIDS patients.
   Starzl, along with <PERSON>Dr. Israel Penn</PERSON>, also found that the risk of
cancer after a transplant increased to <PERCENT>10 percent</PERCENT> for patients
whose pre-transplant tests showed they did not have antibodies to
the <PERSON>Epstein Barr</PERSON> virus, which causes mononucleosis.
   About <PERCENT>80 percent</PERCENT> of those patients become infected with the
virus after transplantation, and researchers believe there is some
correlation between that and the development of cancer,
particularly in the lymph nodes.
   Researchers also will try to determine why liver transplant
recipients whose previous liver was removed because of cancer often
develop the cancer again with the new organ.
   In such patients, the cancer does not show up in other parts of
the body.
   ``We are not even sure if it is the same cancer that returns to
the new liver or a new cancer that arises in the liver. Nothing is
known about this,'' she said.
   The return of cancer, <PERSON>Whiteside</PERSON> said, must have something to do
with a person's immune system after transplantation or the immune
defenses within the liver itself.
   Transplant patients get drugs to suppress their body's natural
defenses after surgery to prevent rejection of the new organs, and
the drugs also make the patients susceptible to other infections.

<TEXT>
   The acne drug Accutane, which can cause birth
defects in pregnant women, prevents skin cancer in people at
extremely high risk of the common malignancy, a study concludes.
   Experts cautioned that the treatment is too toxic to be used
routinely by most people who are afraid of skin cancer. But they
said it raises the possibility that similar drugs may someday be
given safely to prevent this and other forms of cancer.
   Until now, medicines have been given almost exclusively to
attack cancers once they occur rather than to prevent them.
   ``This is the first study that has scientifically proven in
humans that skin cancer can be prevented by any means,'' said <PERSON>Dr.
Howard Koh</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Boston University School of Medicine</ORGANIZATION>. ``We use sun
screens because they should work, but we still have not rigorously
proven in a scientific way that skin cancer can be prevented with
that method.'' Sun is considered the main cause of skin cancer.
   However, he cautioned that the study, conducted on just five
people, is very small, and it is unclear whether the findings will
apply to those at lower risk of skin cancer.
   Dr. <PERSON>Kenneth H. Kraemer</PERSON>, who directed the research at the
<ORGANIZATION>National Cancer Institute</ORGANIZATION>, believes the study could represent a
step toward cancer prevention.
   He noted that Accutane is one of more than 2,000 synthetic forms
of vitamin A, and some of these could prove safe and effective for
routine use in warding off skin cancer in low-risk people.
   ``You are better off preventing it by avoiding the sun at the
beginning,'' <PERSON>Kraemer</PERSON> said. ``But if that isn't the case, this is an
indication that drugs may be developed to prevent the progression
of the damage to cancer.''
   The study was conducted on victims of xeroderma pigmentosum, an
inherited skin disorder that occurs in about one in 1 million
people. Their skin is unable to repair genetic damage caused by
sunlight, and they are more than 1,000 times more likely than the
average to get basal cell or squamous cell cancer of the skin.
   In the general population, these are the most common kinds of
cancer, striking about 500,000 people in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> each
year. These tumors, which are usually curable, occur most
frequently in light-skinned people.
   In the study, published in <DATE>Thursday</DATE>'s New England Journal of
Medicine, five patients took high doses of Accutane for two years.
   Doctors compared the number of tumors before, during and after
treatment. In the two years before taking Accutane, the five
patients had a total of 121 tumors. While on the drug, they had 25.
When the drug was stopped, they had nearly a nine-fold increase in
the frequency of tumors.
   But side effects caused two people of the seven who started in
the study to drop out. One had high levels of blood fats, while the
other showed signs of liver abnormalities.
   The researchers currently are checking to see if a dose
one-quarter as large will work as well but be less hazardous.
   <PERSON>Kraemer</PERSON> said high doses of Accutane could be warranted for some
people, such as sailors and farmers, who have frequent skin cancers
because of their lifelong exposure to the sun.
   Accutane, known generically as isotretinoin, is already widely
used to treat severe acne. Because of its possible danger for
pregnant women, the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Food and Drug Administration</ORGANIZATION> last month
ordered its maker, <PERSON>Hoffman-La Roche</PERSON>, to warn customers by printing
a picture of a deformed baby on the drug's packaging.
   At least two other studies using Accutane to treat pre-cancerous
ailments have been published over the <DATE>last two years</DATE>. One showed
that the drug clears up oral leukoplakia, pre-cancerous white
patches in the mouth that are common among smokers. The other found
that it improved the survival of people with myelodysplastic
syndrome, a pre-leukemic disorder.
   Some experts also believe that beta carotene, the form of
vitamin A found in food, helps prevent cancer.
   <PERSON>Dr. Harley Haynes</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Brigham and Women's Hospital</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> said
that vitamin A drugs similar to Accutane may someday be used to
treat other tumors of epithelial tissue, such as cancers of the
lung, stomach, colon, bladder, cervix and breast.

  [Text] <LOCATION>Sofia</LOCATION>, <DATE>March 15</DATE> (BTA) -- Associate Professor 
<PERSON>Khristo Tsvetanski</PERSON>, a cancer specialist working with the 
<ORGANIZATION>National Oncology Centre</ORGANIZATION> since <DATE>1970</DATE>, gave BTA an interview on 
the incidence of cancer in <LOCATION>Bulgaria</LOCATION>. 
  Q: How does the cancer incidence in <LOCATION>Bulgaria</LOCATION> 
compare to European rates? 
  A: <LOCATION>Bulgaria</LOCATION> ranks in the medium range of cancer 
incidence, according to figures released by the Epidemiology 
Unit of the <ORGANIZATION>National Oncology Centre</ORGANIZATION>, which are also reported to 
the <ORGANIZATION>World Health Organization</ORGANIZATION>. 
  Q: Where does cancer stand among the major causes 
of early death and disability? 
  A: It ranks second after heart disease. 
  Q: Is cancer incidence in <LOCATION>Bulgaria</LOCATION> on the 
increase? 
  A: There is an upward trend worldwide and 
<LOCATION>Bulgaria</LOCATION> is no exception. I will quote again figures provided 
by our (epidemiology) unit. In <DATE>1985</DATE>, 20,881 developed cancer, 
bringing the total number of cancer patients to 132,374. The 
<DATE>1990</DATE> figures are 22,021 and 153,651, respectively. In <DATE>1992</DATE>, 
22,956 Bulgarians developed cancer, bringing the total to 
139,243. 
  Q: Which types of cancer are the most widespread 
in <LOCATION>Bulgaria</LOCATION>? 
  A: According to statistics, lung cancer ranks 
first, followed by breast, stomach, rectal and colon cancer. 
Men are mostly affected by lung cancer. Other widespread types 
of cancer in men are stomach, rectal, prostatic and colon 
cancer. Women suffer most often from breast cancer, as well as 
from cervical and ovarian cancer. 
  Q: Is cancer diagnosed early in <LOCATION>Bulgaria</LOCATION>? 
  A: Comparing <LOCATION>Bulgaria</LOCATION> to the developed countries, 
there is a lot to be desired in this respect. It is alarming 
that in recent years we have witnessed a retreat. In <DATE>1990</DATE>, 
<PERCENT>52.99 percent</PERCENT> of patients were diagnosed early. In <DATE>1992</DATE> their 
proportion was <PERCENT>48.58 percent</PERCENT>. 
  Q: Is cancer screening done now? 
  A: There used to be two mass screening programmes 
for a long time. Fluorography, that is, screening for growths 
in the chest and mainly in the lungs, is no longer done as the 
method was rejected. Starting from <DATE>1956</DATE>, all sexually active 
women were invited to be screened for cervical cancer. In <DATE>1971</DATE> 
the smear (<ORGANIZATION>Pap</ORGANIZATION>) test was introduced. Over 1.5 million women 
used to be tested every year, as a result of which many were 
treated for conditions that might otherwise have developed into 
cancer, or cancer was diagnosed early and treatment was much 
easier and more effective. It is a pity that screening has not 
been done since <DATE>1990</DATE>.

   Medical scientists are starting to uncover a handful of genes which, if damaged, unleash the chaotic growth of cells that characterizes cancer. 

   Scientists say the discovery of these genes in recent months is painting a new and startling picture of how cancer develops. 
An emerging understanding of the genes is expected to produce an array of new strategies for future cancer treatment and prevention. 

   That is for the future. 
Already, scientists are developing tests based on the newly identified genes that, for the first time, can predict whether an otherwise healthy individual is likely to get cancer. 

   "It's a super-exciting set of discoveries," says <PERSON>Bert Vogelstein</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Johns Hopkins University</ORGANIZATION> researcher who has just found a gene pivotal to the triggering of colon cancer. 
"Only a decade ago cancer was a black box about which we knew nothing at the molecular level. 
Today, we know that the accumulation of several of these altered genes can initiate a cancer and, then, propel it into a deadly state." 

   Scientists call the new class of genes tumor-suppressors, or simply anti-cancer genes. 
When functioning normally, they make proteins that hold a cell's growth in check. 
But if the genes are damaged -- perhaps by radiation, a chemical or through a chance accident in cell division -- their growth-suppressing proteins no longer work, and cells normally under control turn malignant. 

   The newly identified genes differ from a family of genes discovered in the early <DATE>1980s</DATE> called oncogenes. 
Oncogenes must be present for a cell to become malignant, but researchers have found them in normal as well as in cancerous cells, suggesting that oncogenes don't cause cancer by themselves. 
In recent months, researchers have come to believe the two types of cancer genes work in concert: An oncogene may turn proliferating cells malignant only after the tumor-suppressor gene has been damaged. 

   Like all genes, tumor-suppressor genes are inherited in two copies, one from each parent. 
Either copy can make the proteins needed to control cell growth, so for cancer to arise, both copies must be impaired. 
A person who is born with one defective copy of a suppressor gene, or in whom one copy is damaged early in life, is especially prone to cancer because he need only lose the other copy for a cancer to develop. 

   Emerging genetic tests will be able to spot such cancer-susceptible individuals, ushering in what some scientists believe is a new age of predictive cancer diagnosis. 

   Bill and <PERSON>Bonnie Quinlan</PERSON> are among the first beneficiaries of the new findings. 
The <LOCATION>Dedham</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION>, couple knew even before <PERSON>Bonnie</PERSON> became pregnant in <DATE>1987</DATE> that any child of theirs had a <PERCENT>50%</PERCENT> chance of being at risk for retinoblastoma, an eye cancer that occurs about once every 20,000 births. 
<PERSON>Mr. Quinlan</PERSON>, 30 years old, knew he carried a damaged gene, having lost an eye to the rare tumor when he was only two months old -- after his mother had suffered the same fate when she was a baby. 

   Because of the isolation of the retinoblastoma tumor-suppressor gene, it became possible last <DATE>January</DATE> to find out what threat the <PERSON>Quinlan</PERSON> baby faced. 
A test using new "genetic probes" showed that little <PERSON>Will Quinlan</PERSON> had not inherited a damaged retinoblastoma supressor gene and, therefore, faced no more risk than other children of developing the rare cancer. 
"It made our New Year," says <PERSON>Mr. Quinlan</PERSON>. 

   This test was the first to predict reliably whether an individual could expect to develop cancer. 
Equally important, the initial discovery of the gene that controls retinal cell growth, made by a <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> doctor named <PERSON>Thaddeus Dryja</PERSON>, has opened a field of cancer study, which in recent months has exploded. 
"It turns out that studying a tragic but uncommon tumor made possible some fundamental insights about the most basic workings of cancer," says <PERSON>Samuel Broder</PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION>National Cancer Institute</ORGANIZATION>. 
"All this may not be obvious to the public, which is concerned about advances in treatment, but I am convinced this basic research will begin showing results there soon." 

   To date, scientists have fingered two of these cancer-suppressors. 
<PERSON>Dr. Dryja</PERSON> made his retinoblastoma discovery in <DATE>1986</DATE>. 
Then last <DATE>spring</DATE>, researchers reported finding a gene called p53 which, if impaired, turns healthy colon cells cancerous. 

   Soon after that report, two other research teams uncovered evidence that the same damaged p53 gene is present in tissue from lung and breast cancers. 
Colon, lung and breast cancers are the most common and lethal forms of the disease, collectively killing almost 200,000 Americans a year. 
Right now about a dozen laboratories, in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>, are racing to unmask other suspected tumor-suppressing genes. 
They have about seven candidates. 
Researchers say the inactivation of tumor-suppressor genes, alone or in combination, appears crucial to the development of such scourges as cancer of the brain, the skin, kidney, prostate, and cervix. 
There is evidence that if people inherit defective versions of these genes, they are especially prone to cancer, perhaps explaining, finally, why some cancers seem to haunt certain families. 

   The story of tumor-suppressor genes goes back to the <DATE>1970s</DATE>, when a pediatrician named <PERSON>Alfred G. Knudson Jr.</PERSON> proposed that retinoblastoma stemmed from two separate genetic defects. 
He theorized that in the eye cancer, an infant inherited a damaged copy of a gene from one parent and a normal copy from the other. 
The tumor, he suggested, developed when the second, normal copy also was damaged. 
But there was no way to prove <PERSON>Dr. Knudson</PERSON>'s "two-hit" theory. 

   Back then, scientists had no way of ferreting out specific genes, but under a microscope they could see the 23 pairs of chromosomes in the cells that contain the genes. 
Occasionally, gross chromosome damage was visible. 
<PERSON>Dr. Knudson</PERSON> found that some children with the eye cancer had inherited a damaged copy of chromosome No. 13 from a parent who had had the disease. 
Under a microscope he could actually see that a bit of chromosome 13 was missing. 
He assumed the missing piece contained a gene or genes whose loss had a critical role in setting off the cancer. 
But he didn't know which gene or genes had disappeared. 

   Then, a scientific team led by molecular geneticist <PERSON>Webster Cavenee</PERSON>, then at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Utah</ORGANIZATION>, found the answer. 
The team used a battery of the newly developed "gene probes," snippets of genetic material that can track a gene's presence in a cell. 
By analyzing cells extracted from eye tumors, they found defects in the second copy of chromosome 13 in the exact area as in the first copy of the chromosome. 

   The finding riveted medicine. 
It was the first time anyone had showed that the loss of both copies of the same gene could lead to the eruption of a cancer. 
"It was extraordinarily satisfying," says <PERSON>Dr. Knudson</PERSON>, now at <ORGANIZATION>Fox Chase Cancer Research Center</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION>. 
"I was convinced that what was true of retinoblastoma would be true for all cancers." 

   It was an audacious claim. 
But in <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Dr. Vogelstein</PERSON>, a young molecular biologist at <ORGANIZATION>Johns Hopkins Medical School</ORGANIZATION>, believed <PERSON>Dr. Knudson</PERSON> was right, and set out to repeat the Cavenee experiment in cells from other cancers. 
His was one of two research teams in <DATE>1984</DATE> to report dual chromosome losses for a rare childhood cancer of the kidney called <PERSON>Wilm</PERSON>'s tumor. 

   <PERSON>Dr. Vogelstein</PERSON> next turned his attention to colon cancer, the second biggest cancer killer in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> after lung cancer. 
He believed colon cancer might also arise from multiple "hits" on cancer suppressor genes, because it often seems to develop in stages. 
It often is preceded by the development of polyps in the bowel, which in some cases become increasingly malignant in identifiable stages -- progressing from less severe to deadly -- as though a cascade of genetic damage might be occurring. 

   <PERSON>Dr. Vogelstein</PERSON> and a doctoral student, <PERSON>Eric Fearon</PERSON>, began months of tedious and often frustrating probing of the chromosomes searching for signs of genetic damage. 
They began uncovering a confusing variety of genetic deletions, some existing only in benign polyps, others in malignant cells and many in both polyps and malignant cells. 
Gradually, a coherent picture of cancer development emerged. 
If both copies of a certain gene were knocked out, benign polyps would develop. 
If both copies of a second gene were then deleted, the polyps would progress to malignancy. 
It was clear that more than one gene had to be damaged for colon cancer to develop. 

   Their report galvanized other molecular biologists. 
"It was the confirming evidence we all needed that {gene} losses were critical to the development of a common tumor," says <PERSON>Ray White</PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Salt Lake City</LOCATION>. 

   But <PERSON>Dr. Vogelstein</PERSON> had yet to nail the identity of the gene that, if damaged, flipped a colon cell into full-blown malignancy. 
They focused on chromosome 17. 
For months the <PERSON>Johns Hopkins</PERSON> researchers, using gene probes, experimentally crawled down the length of chromosome 17, looking for the smallest common bit of genetic material lost in all tumor cells. 
Such a piece of <ORGANIZATION>DNA</ORGANIZATION> would probably constitute a gene. 

   When they found it <DATE>last winter</DATE>, <PERSON>Dr. Vogelstein</PERSON> was dubious that the search was over. 
His doubts stemmed from the fact that <DATE>several years earlier</DATE> a <ORGANIZATION>Princeton University</ORGANIZATION> researcher, <PERSON>Arnold Levine</PERSON>, had found in experiments with mice that a gene called p53 could transform normal cells into cancerous ones. 
The deletion <PERSON>Dr. Vogelstein</PERSON> found was in exactly the same spot as p53. 
But <PERSON>Mr. Levine</PERSON> had said the p53 gene caused cancer by promoting growth, whereas the <PERSON>Johns Hopkins</PERSON> scientists were looking for a gene that suppressed growth. 

   Despite that, when the <PERSON>Johns Hopkins</PERSON> scientists compared the gene they had found in the human cancer cells with the <PERSON>Mr. Levine</PERSON>'s p53 gene they found the two were identical; it turned out that in <PERSON>Mr. Levine</PERSON>'s cancer studies, he had unknowingly been observing a damaged form of p53 -- a cancer-suppressing gene. 

   The discovery "suddenly puts an obscure gene right in the cockpit of cancer formation," says <PERSON>Robert Weinberg</PERSON>, a leader in cancer-gene research at <ORGANIZATION>Whitehead Institute</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Cambridge</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass</LOCATION>. 

   Evidence now is emerging that the p53 suppressor gene is involved in other cancers, too. 
Researchers in <LOCATION>Edinburgh</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Scotland</LOCATION>, have found that in 23 of 38 breast tumors, one copy of chromosome 17 was mutated at the spot where gene p53 lies. 
The scientists say that since breast cancer often strikes multiple members of certain families, the gene, when inherited in a damaged form, may predispose women to the cancer. 

   The p53 gene has just been implicated in lung cancer. 
In a report out last week, <PERSON>John Minna</PERSON> and colleagues at the <ORGANIZATION>National Cancer Institute</ORGANIZATION> say that about half the cells taken from lung cancer tissue they tested are missing this gene. 

   There also are reports from several labs, as yet unpublished, of missing p53 genes in tissue taken from kidney, brain and skin cancers. 

   At the same time, the <PERSON>Johns Hopkins</PERSON> team and others are rushing to pinpoint other tumor-suppressor genes. 
<PERSON>Dr. Vogelstein</PERSON> hopes soon to isolate one on chromosome 18, also involved in colon cancer. 
Ray White in <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Walter Bodmer</PERSON>, a researcher in <LOCATION>Great Britain</LOCATION>, are close to finding another gene involved with some types of colon cancer, thought to be on chromosome 5. 

   <PERSON>Dr. Minna</PERSON> believes people who inherit a defective gene somewhere on one of their two copies of chromosome 3 are especially prone to lung cancer. 
Recently, he and others reported that the retinoblastoma suppressor gene may also be involved in some lung cancers, as well as several other more common cancers, too. 

   Where these discoveries will lead, scientists can only speculate. 
Already two major pharmaceutical companies, the <ORGANIZATION>Squibb</ORGANIZATION> unit of <ORGANIZATION>Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Hoffmann-La Roche Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, are collaborating with gene hunters to turn the anticipated cascade of discoveries into predictive tests and, maybe, new therapies. 

   Some researchers say new cancer drugs to slow or reverse tumor growth may be based on the suppressor proteins normally produced by the genes. 
The idea would be to administer to patients the growth-controlling proteins made by healthy versions of the damaged genes. 
It may even be possible to replace defective genes with healthy versions, though no one has come close to doing that so far. 

   In any case, says <PERSON>Dr. Minna</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>National Cancer Institute</ORGANIZATION>, "We're witnessing the discovery of one of the most important steps in the genesis of cancer."

   Researchers in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION> report, in
studies published today, new advances toward isolating the gene
linked to a susceptibility to breast cancer in some families.
   <PERSON>Mary-Claire King</PERSON>, leader of a laboratory group at the <ORGANIZATION>University
of California</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Berkeley</LOCATION>, said her studies have narrowed the search
for the breast cancer gene to a specific chromosome.
   Comparing the work to a needle-in-a-haystack quest, <PERSON>King</PERSON> said in
an interview, ``We're now at the point of knowing the handful of
hay in which this needle lies, as opposed to having to search
through the whole haystack.''
   A research group at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Utah Health Sciences
Center</ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, reported finding that proliferative breast
disease, a condition known to be a precursor of breast cancer, has
been found to be inherited in some families.
   ``Based on this study, we believe the genetic susceptibility to
breast cancer is more common than previously thought,'' said <PERSON>Dr.
Mark H. Skolnick</PERSON> of the <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION> group.
   Both groups have been researching families with large numbers of
breast cancer cases. Their studies are published today in the
journal Science.
   <PERSON>Skolnick</PERSON> and <PERSON>King</PERSON> said their studies could lead eventually to
tests enabling women with known breast cancer risks, based on their
family histories, to be treated even before the smallest of tumors
have formed.
   ``The long-term goal of this kind of work is to try to develop
diagnostic techniques that will allow the detection of aberrant
cells in the breast at an extremely early stage,'' said <PERSON>King</PERSON>.
``Those cells could be removed and the woman go on with a normal
life.''
   With such tests used widely, she said, ``it would be possible
that there would be no mortality from breast cancer.''
   Such clinical applications of the two studies, however, are many
years away, <PERSON>King</PERSON> said.
   In the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> project, the scientist said her team studied
more than 400 members of 23 families with a total of 146 cases of
breast cancer. Breast cancer in those families, she said, tended to
develop at an early age and often involved both breasts.
   By analyzing blood samples and then comparing genetic patterns,
<PERSON>King</PERSON> said, the scientists found nine families in which
susceptibility to the early onset of breast cancer was linked to
chromosome 17q, one of the 46 chromosomes found in human cells.
   Now, she said, the researchers are attempting to find the
specific breast cancer gene within that chromosome.
   King said that even when the gene is found, it will not be the
final story in inherited breast cancer risk. She said a combination
of genes is involved in developing the disease and that still other
genes may permit the cancer to grow and proliferate.
   Furthermore, the scientist said, most breast cancers may have no
inherited genetic component.
   ``People need to understand that having a mother with breast
cancer does not mean it runs in the family,'' she said. Families
such as those studied, where early breast cancer occurs often, are
``really, really rare,'' said <PERSON>King</PERSON>. ``Less than <PERCENT>5 percent</PERCENT> of breast
cancer patients are in such families.''
   <PERSON>Skolnick</PERSON> said his researchers studied 103 women from 20 families
in which there were at least two close blood relatives with breast
cancer. The studies included mammography and the removal of cells
for laboratory and genetic analysis. Control studies were done on
31 women who did not come from breast cancer-prone families.
   Thirty-five percent of the women in families where breast cancer
was common had laboratory evidence of proliferative breast disease,
or <ORGANIZATION>PBD</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Skolnick</PERSON> said.
   Among women in the control study, only <PERCENT>13 percent</PERCENT> had <ORGANIZATION>PBD</ORGANIZATION>. The
study demonstrates that there is an inherited component in
developing <ORGANIZATION>PBD</ORGANIZATION>, he said.
   <PERSON>Skolnick</PERSON> said the study also suggests that the inherited risk
for breast cancer, thought previously to be a factor primarily in
families in which cases develop in young women of childbearing age
and in women who develop cancer in both breasts, may also be a
factor in families where the cancer develops only in older women.
   ``Our study shows that there is a significant genetic component
for unilateral (single breast) post-menopausal breast cancer as
well,'' he said. For this reason, <PERSON>Skolnick</PERSON> said the inherited risk
of breast cancer may be more common than previously believed. It
will take more studies to prove this, however.
   Science, which published the studies, is the journal of the
<ORGANIZATION>American Association</ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION>Advancement of Science</ORGANIZATION>.

   Scientists said they pinpointed how sunlight causes a
common form of skin cancer, the strongest evidence yet
linking the environment directly to a cancer.
   The scientists, led by researchers at Yale University
School of Medicine, found that the sun's ultraviolet rays
disable a particular gene known to control cell growth. Over
the past three years, scientists have found that when the
gene, called p53, is somehow damaged, cells usually under
control can become malignant.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Until now, there was scant evidence about exactly what
causes the gene to go awry, although scientists have
speculated that environmental agents, such as sunlight or
radiation, are the trigger.
   "There is little doubt that skin cancer involves exposure
to the sun, but we didn't know exactly what happens," said
<PERSON>David Leffell</PERSON>, chief of dermatologic surgery at the <ORGANIZATION>Yale</ORGANIZATION>
medical school. "Now we do."
   The finding is one of the most important to emerge from
the spate of discoveries over the past three years showing
that cancers arise when certain genes that usually control
cell growth become altered or defective. In particular, the
p53 gene has been linked by scientists to cancers of the
colon, breast, lung, kidney, and brain.
   There is evidence suggesting that people who inherit a
mutated version of p53, or other so-called tumor-suppressor
genes, are especially susceptible to cancer. But most
scientists have argued that the vast majority of cancers
develop when these same genes are deactivated, either through
some spontaneous mistake during cell division or from
exposure to a cancer-causing agent. But only in the past few
months have scientists begun to find evidence linking
suspected carcinogens to the genes.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Yale</ORGANIZATION> team, aided by researchers in <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>
and <LOCATION>Uppsala</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION>, made the connection by looking at cancer
cells taken from 24 patients. They found that one tiny "hot
spot" in the p53 gene was altered in the exact same manner in
<PERCENT>72%</PERCENT> of the cases they studied. "What really surprised us is
that the defect was exactly the kind of change that only
occurs when (genetic material) is exposed to ultraviolet
light," said <PERSON>Douglas Brash</PERSON>, who led the research for the <ORGANIZATION>Yale</ORGANIZATION>
group.
   Ultraviolet light transforms one of four chemical bases,
which recur thousands of times in differing order in the
gene, into another of the four bases. Researchers found that
this change, benign in other genes, is disastrous to p53,
causing the gene to manufacture a defective protein that
destroys the cell's growth-regulating system.
   There are about 650,000 new cases of skin cancer in the
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> every year, and about 8,500 deaths related to the
disease, making it the most common of all cancers. The <ORGANIZATION>Yale</ORGANIZATION>
research, published <DATE>today</DATE> in the National Proceedings of the
<ORGANIZATION>Academy of Science</ORGANIZATION>, involved cancer of squamous skin cells.
The scientists also are looking for similar gene damage in
basal cell cancer and melanoma, the other two major forms of
the disease.
   The Yale scientists said their discovery isn't expected to
produce immediate benefits for treating the disease. But the
finding, they said, should inspire other researchers who are
searching for the exact environmental cause for other
cancers.
   "There is, of course, good reason to believe that
cigarette smoke causes lung cancer by acting on p53 or other
tumor suppressor genes," said <PERSON>Dr. Brash</PERSON>. "Finding as strong a
link as we found won't be easy, but it is the proof everyone
needs."

<HEAD>Researchers: Drug Causes Remission of Colon Cancer in Mice</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH RENDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new drug derived from a Chinese tree has
triggered remissions of colon cancer in laboratory mice, doctors
said in a preliminary report.
   ``In 20 years in this lab, we've never seen anything like this.
We have animals that are tumor-free,'' said <PERSON>Dr. John Stehlin</PERSON>,
scientific director at the <ORGANIZATION>Stehlin Foundation for Cancer Research</ORGANIZATION>
at <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>St. Joseph Hospital</ORGANIZATION>.
   During two years of experiments, researchers said they treated
about 100 mice with three kinds of human colon cancer: slow-,
medium- and fast-growing. Once the mice began developing tumors,
they were divided into two groups: those receiving the new drug,
9-amino Camptothecin, or 9-AC; and those receiving no treatment.
   Most mice showed no trace of residual cancer after being treated
with 9-AC for several months, doctors said. The untreated mice died.
   Some mice treated with 9-AC are still alive after surviving the
equivalent, in human terms, of 20 years, <PERSON>Stehlin</PERSON> said at a briefing
this week.
   The findings were published today in the journal Science.
   ``This is a preliminary report,'' he said. ``Obviously, more
work needs to be done with additional colon cancers and other forms
of cancer that are not responsive to the standard anti-cancer
agents.''
   Colon cancer is the third most common cancer in the <LOCATION>United
States</LOCATION> with 147,000 new cases reported each year. The disease, most
commonly treated by surgery, takes about 60,000 lives annually.
   Beppino Giovanella, director of the <ORGANIZATION>St. Joseph Hospital
Laboratory for Cancer Research</ORGANIZATION>, said all three tumors used in the
experiments had not responded to major known anti-cancer drugs
administered at maximum tolerable doses.
   Giovanella also said two mice injected with lung cancer have
shown a regression of their cancer after being treated with 9-AC.
   Very little progress has been made in colon cancer treatment in
the past 40 years, <PERSON>Stehlin</PERSON> said. Chemotherapy and immunotherapy
have had little effect and the use of the drug levamisole with
5-fluorouracil improves the survival rate in about <PERCENT>15 percent</PERCENT> of
patients, he said.
   Researchers said mice with the slow-growing cancer responded to
9-AC within 10 days and by 20 days were tumor-free.
   The mice with the medium-growing cancer took about 10 days to
start reacting and in about 25 days were in remission, according to
researchers. Mice treated with the fast-growing cancer took 21 days
before responding to 9-AC.
   The 9-AC drug is a derivative of camptothecin, an alkaloid
extracted from a Chinese tree. <PERSON>Dr. Monroe</PERSON> Wall of the <ORGANIZATION>Research
Triangle Institute</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION> isolated camptothecin in the
<DATE>1960s</DATE>.
   It was tested on humans but was soon discarded because of its
excessive toxicity. Researchers are hoping to find out whether 9-AC
is as toxic as its parent. If approved by the <ORGANIZATION>Food and Drug
Administration</ORGANIZATION>, the researchers could start tests on humans as
early as next year.
   Doctors at <ORGANIZATION>Johns Hopkins School of Medicine</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION> have
identified camptothecin as a potent inhibitor of topoisomerase I,
an enzyme present in animal cells which controls cell division.
Studies at <ORGANIZATION>New York University</ORGANIZATION> say cancerous colons usually have
more topoisomerase I than normal colons.

<FÊP=106> [Article: "<PERSON>Tim Radford</PERSON> on an Atlas Which Utilises an 18-Year </F>
Study To Demonstrate the Geography of Disease: Cancer Map Shows 
North-South Divide"] 
  [Text] The first atlas of cancer cases in <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> and 
<LOCATION>Wales</LOCATION>, published yesterday [not reproduced] throws the geography 
of disease into relief across the country. 
  The analysis of 3 million cases over an 18-year period, 
county by county, reveals some puzzles and confirms the 
north-south health divide. 
  More than 70 maps, commissioned by the <ORGANIZATION>Cancer Research 
Campaign</ORGANIZATION>, show an excess of lung cancers in the north of 
<LOCATION>England</LOCATION>, of breast cancers among older women in the south, and 
as "hot spot" of stomach cancer in <LOCATION>Wales</LOCATION>. 
  But malignant melanomas of the skin occur with greater 
frequency in the south and west, where sunshine levels are 
highest. 
  The atlas shows a less easily explained excess of lip cancer 
in <LOCATION>East Anglia</LOCATION> and of thyroid cancer in <LOCATION>north Wales</LOCATION>. It also 
reveals <LOCATION>Anglesey</LOCATION> as having the highest incidence of penile, 
cervical and lip cancer in the country. 
  There are many reasons for cancer. "These can include your 
job, where and how you live, your diet, your drinking and 
smoking habits, and your sexual behaviour," said Professor 
<PERSON>Gordon McVie</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Cancer Research Campaign</ORGANIZATION>. 
  "This atlas will help cancer professionals to home in on 
areas of high risk and identify the reasons why some types of 
the disease are more common in a particular area." 
  Mapping of diseases began in <DATE>1850</DATE>, when a <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> doctor 
tracked cholera cases and found a variation according to source 
of water supply. This was before cholera was identified as a 
water-borne disease. But epidemiology -- the science of the 
study of large numbers of cases according to patterns of 
behaviour -- has since been used to link lung cancer with 
smoking and scrotal cancer with some engineering industries, and 
mesothalamia with shipbuilding. 
  The atlas is supported by appendices carrying regional and 
county information on abortion rates, air pollution, alcohol 
consumption, household food purchases, percentages of residents 
born outside <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>, socio-economic and educational status, 
occupation, venereal disease clinic attendances, and so on. 
  The maps were prepared by Dr <PERSON>Anthony Swerdlow</PERSON> and <PERSON>Dr Isabel 
dos Santos Silva</PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION>London School of Hygiene and Tropical 
Medicine</ORGANIZATION>. They are based on records of an average 176,000 cases 
of cancers in each year between <DATE>1968</DATE> and <DATE>1985</DATE>. More than 33,000 
were of lung cancer, and more than 20,000 were breast cancers. 
  There have been earlier maps of cancer mortality but these 
have not shown the whole picture, because some cancers are 
almost invariably fatal and some are more easily cured. 
  The statistics show a link between scrotal cancer and 
engineering, but no obvious link with leukaemia and nuclear 
power generation. 
  However, there are marked differences according to area. 
  Lancashire has 63 per cent more male lung cancers than the 
average for the rest of the country; <ORGANIZATION>Montgomeryshire</ORGANIZATION> recorded 85 
per cent fewer. Caernarvonshire and <LOCATION>Staffordshire</LOCATION> showed 37 per 
cent higher than average rates of stomach cancer, the Isle of 
Wight 35 per cent lower. 
  Prostate cancer incidence was higher in <LOCATION>Cambridgeshire</LOCATION> and 
<LOCATION>Somerset</LOCATION>, lower in <LOCATION>Denbighshire</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Durham</LOCATION>. Lung cancer among 
women under 45 was lowest (60 per cent lower) in <LOCATION>Hereford</LOCATION> and 
<LOCATION>Worcester</LOCATION> and highest (74 per cent higher) in <LOCATION>Northumberland</LOCATION>. 
  Breast cancer for women under 45 was highest in <LOCATION>Lincolnshire</LOCATION> 
(40 per cent) and lowest in Camarthenshire (24 per cent).

   Women taking the drug tamoxifen to prevent a recurrence of
breast cancer may be getting an extra benefit: lower
cholesterol levels.
   University of Wisconsin cancer researchers reported that
breast cancer patients who had been taking tamoxifen twice a
day for two years had significantly lower blood cholesterol
levels than a comparable group of breast cancer patients who
hadn't taken the drug.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A drop in blood cholesterol levels is presumed to reduce
the women's risk of coronary heart disease and heart attack.
The incidence of heart attacks in women rises sharply after
menopause and are the most common cause of death in women
over 60 years old. The incidence of breast cancer also rises
sharply after age 60.
   Tamoxifen is sold in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> as Nolvadex by the <ORGANIZATION>ICI
Pharmaceuticals</ORGANIZATION> unit of <ORGANIZATION>Imperial Chemical Industries PLC</ORGANIZATION> of
<LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>.
   Although tamoxifen was first marketed in <DATE>1977</DATE> for treating
advanced breast cancer, research in the last five years or so
has indicated the drug can prevent breast cancer. It has
become almost routine for all breast cancer patients to take
it after surgery. A large-scale trial is being planned to see
if it can reduce the risk of breast cancer in women who
haven't yet had the disease but who have a family history of
breast cancer.
   Tamoxifen originally was thought to prevent the recurrence
of breast cancer by blocking the tendency of breast cancer
cells to be stimulated by estrogen, the female sex hormone.
Hence, it is known technically as an anti-estrogen.
   More recent research, however, indicates the drug may have
a multitude of other effects in the body, some of which are
similar to the effects of estrogen. Thus, researchers are
considering the possibility that tamoxifen could be used for
hormone replacement therapy much as estrogen therapy is now
used in post-menopausal women.
   The new evidence on tamoxifen's effects on cholesterol,
for example, lends support to a suggested large-scale trial
in healthy older women to see if the drug can reduce the
incidence of breast cancer, heart disease and bone fractures
due to osteoporosis, the weakening of the bones commonly seen
in women after menopause, the <LOCATION>Wisconsin</LOCATION> researchers stated in
the report in the <DATE>Dec. 1</DATE> issue of the Annals of Internal
Medicine.
   The researchers, headed by <PERSON>Richard R. Love</PERSON> of the
university's <ORGANIZATION>Clinical Cancer Center</ORGANIZATION>, said they had done
periodic blood tests on 64 women who were taking tamoxifen in
an experiment to see if the drug would reduce the recurrence
of breast cancers. They did similar blood tests on 62 women
who were taking an inert pill that looked like tamoxifen, a
so-called placebo.
   The women ranged from 46 to 64 years old and all were past
menopause. They had been diagnosed and successfully treated
for early stage breast cancer less than 10 years previously.
   The mean cholesterol level of the women who had been
taking tamoxifen for two years was <PERCENT>12%</PERCENT> lower than that of the
women who took the placebo for two years. At the start of the
experiment, the total cholesterol levels of the
tamoxifen-treated women ranged between 209 and 233 milligrams
per deciliter of blood, After two years of tamoxifen the
levels dropped by 19 to 32 milligrams with the sharpest drops
occurring in women with the higher levels.
   In contrast, the women taking the placebo started with
cholesterol levels of 220 to 237 milligrams. Over the two
years, they experienced drops of only one to 11 milligrams of
cholesterol per deciliter of blood.
   The tamoxifen-treated women showed even sharper declines
in the LDL-type of cholesterol, the "bad" variety of
cholesterol that has been strongly linked to coronary heart
disease. The mean level of LDL-cholesterol was <PERCENT>20%</PERCENT> lower in
the tamoxifen-treated women than in the placebo-taking women.
   The levels of HDL-cholesterol, the "good" form of
cholesterol that seems to protect people against heart
disease, dropped slightly in both groups of women. By the end
of two years, the drop in HDL-cholesterol levels was about
the same in both groups.

<HEAD>Hospitalization Goes Down This Decade For Four Cancers</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: For release 6:30 p.m. EDT</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal health officials said <DATE>Thursday</DATE> that
hospitalization rates have fallen in the <DATE>1980s</DATE> for four major types
of cancer, even though the number of people suffering from the
diseases has not fallen in all cases.
   The national <ORGANIZATION>Centers for Disease Control</ORGANIZATION> reported that
hospitalization rates for breast cancer, lung cancer, colon and
rectal cancer, and cervical cancer all have declined during the
decade. The rates are calculated by looking at records of hospital
discharges.
   Hospitalization rates do not necessarily reflect trends in the
numbers of people with various cancers, said <PERSON>Dr. James Mendlein</PERSON>, a
<ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION> researcher. Some cancers may require more follow-up hospital
stays than others, and the effort to cut the cost of health care
also can influence the number of times a patient is hospitalized,
he noted.
   ``This gives you just one measure of the health care impact (of
various cancers),'' <PERSON>Mendlein</PERSON> said.
   The drop in hospitalization rates parallels the drop in the rate
of occurrence of cervical cancer, colorectal cancer and male lung
cancer, <PERSON>Mendlein</PERSON> said. On the other hand, while hospitalizations
for breast cancer and female lung cancer are declining somewhat,
the incidence of those two diseases continues to increase, he said.
   For <DATE>1986</DATE>, the latest year for which figures are available, the
<ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION> estimates hospital discharge rates as:
   _Breast cancer, 172 per 100,000 people, down from a peak of 199
in <DATE>1983</DATE>.
   _Lung cancer, male, 142 per 100,000, down from a peak of 182 in
<DATE>1984</DATE>.
   _Lung cancer, female, 83 per 100,000, down from a peak of 100 in
<DATE>1983</DATE>.
   _Colorectal cancer, 86 per 100,000, down from a peak of 92 in
<DATE>1981</DATE>.
   _Cervical cancer, 46 per 100,000, down from a peak of 89 in <DATE>1976</DATE>.
   A <ORGANIZATION>National Cancer Institute</ORGANIZATION> report earlier this year put breast
cancer at its highest rate in history, and it is still the leading
cause of cancer death among women. Lung cancer, the leading cause
of cancer deaths overall, is increasing among women and decreasing
among men.
   When studying hospital discharge rates, ``incidence or
occurrence is just one of the forces,'' <PERSON>Mendlein</PERSON> said. ``There are
other, economic forces as well.''
   He noted that such factors as shifts in Medicare policy and
trends in outpatient treatment could change the rates of hospital
visits for various diseases.

<HEAD>Researchers Find Same Gene In Both Breast And Ovarian Cancers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Researchers report in a study published <DATE>today</DATE>
that a gene previously linked to breast cancer also can also be
found in ovarian tumors.
   The study, published today in the journal Science, suggests that
testing for the presence of the gene may provide a way of tailoring
cancer treatment to the precise needs of a patient.
   In a cooperative study by seven laboratories, researchers found
that a specific cancer-related gene, called the HER-2@neu oncogene,
was present in tumors of both the breasts and the ovaries.
   An analysis of samples from 668 breast tumors and 120 ovarian
tumors also showed that the oncogene was actively producing a
protein within the tumors, suggesting that the gene plays an
important role in the disease process.
   Dr. <PERSON>Michael Press</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>University of Southern California</ORGANIZATION>
researcher who participated in the study, said the finding raises
the possibility that diagnostic tests to detect the gene in breast
and ovarian cancers could help doctors determine the precise level
of treatment required by each patient.
   Earlier studies showed that the numbers of HER-2@neu oncogenes
in a breast tumor could predict the outcome of a specific disease.
An amplification, or elevated number, of the oncogenes lead to a
quicker relapse and a shorter period of survival of breast cancer
patients.
   Finding the oncogene in ovarian cancers, said Press, may give
clinicians a predictor of the disease progress in these patients
also.
   ``This gene might be a way of identifying patients who would
have a less favorable clinical outcome,'' he said. ``If one could
identify such patients, then they could be singled out for more
aggressive therapy.''
   This would be particularly important for ovarian cancers. Press
said doctors now can gauge the level of treatment for breast cancer
patients based on whether or not cancer cells are found in nearby
lymph nodes. There currently is no such prognostic indicator for
ovarian cancer, he said.
   The exact role that HEF-2@neu plays in development of cancer
tumors is not understood. But Press said it clearly is an oncogene,
a genetic molecule with a normal function that is changed or
activated in some way to become part of the cancer disease process.
   ``Why that is and what the gene does is unknown at this point,''
said Press. ``We're assuming that the gene is important because it
codes for a protein, but we don't know what the function of that
protein is.''
   Press said the researchers looked unsuccessfully for the same
oncogene in tumors from cancers of the lung, adrenal gland and
colon.
   The researchers also did a statistical study to relate
amplification, or the numbers of the oncogene present in a tumor,
with the outcome of the disease.
   Press said the results show that the greater the amplification,
the poorer the prognosis.
   With ovarian cancer patients having only one copy of the
oncogene in tumor cells, the median survival time was 1,879 days.
For patients with a two- to a five-fold amplification, the median
survival was 959 days. Those with a greater than five-fold
amplification had a median survival of only 243 days. A similar
pattern was shown earlier among breast cancer patients.
   Breast and ovarian cancers account for one-third, or about
162,000, of all the cancers diagnosed annually in American women.
These types of cancers account for about <PERCENT>25 percent</PERCENT> of all cancer
deaths in women.

<HEAD>Research Says New Approach May Eliminate Mastectomy for Breast Cancer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   By shrinking tumors with medicine before
surgery, doctors may be able to eliminate most mastectomies as the
standard treatment for breast cancer, a leading cancer researcher
said <DATE>Monday</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Dr. Gianni Bonadonna</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>National Cancer Institute of Italy</ORGANIZATION>
said his study showed that the new approach could eliminate the
need for mastectomies in <PERCENT>87 percent</PERCENT> of women who otherwise would
have had this mutilating surgery.
   In recent years, doctors have slowly switched to removing just
the lump, not the whole breast, when the tumor is small. However,
this conservative surgery is not usually considered possible when
tumors are large.
   The latest strategy involves shrinking big tumors first with
chemotherapy so they are small enough to be taken out with a
breast-saving operation called a lumpectomy, which generally leaves
about three-quarters of the breast intact. The chemotherapy is the
same as that commonly used after surgery.
   The procedure was outlined by <PERSON>Bonadonna</PERSON> at the annual meeting of
the <ORGANIZATION>American Society of Clinical Oncology</ORGANIZATION>.
   Bonadonna predicted that by <DATE>1994</DATE>, the 100th anniversary of the
radical mastectomy, this common operation ``will be very, very
rare.''
   Surgeons frequently recommend against trying to spare breasts
containing larger tumors because too little healthy tissue is left
to save and because they fear the cancer will be more likely to
spread to other parts of the body.
   So far, <PERSON>Bonadonna</PERSON> and colleagues in <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> have used the new
procedure on 97 patients beginning in <DATE>January 1988</DATE>. Although none
of their cancers have returned, other experts caution that much
longer follow-up will be necessary to know whether this approach is
as good as mastectomies at saving lives.
   Despite recent studies showing that for small tumors, at least,
breast-sparing surgery appears to be safe, some physicians remain
skeptical.
   ``I think there is still a lot of place for mastectomy,''
because the chances of cure may be better, commented <PERSON>Dr. Hendre
Falkson</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>University of Pretoria</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>.
   While cautious, some other physicians said they found
<PERSON>Bonadonna</PERSON>'s findings intriguing.
   ``This challenges the conventional treatment,'' said <PERSON>Dr. Nikolay
Dimitrov</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Michigan State University</ORGANIZATION>. ``It may provide a
revolutionary change in the treatment of breast cancer.''
   Added <PERSON>Dr. Jules Harris</PERSON> of Rush Cancer in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>: ``I think it's
interesting and exciting and will give rise to a great deal of
clinical investigation.''
   Breast cancer is the leading cancer killer of women in the
<LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>. The disease strikes one in 10 women at some time
during their lives and caused 42,000 deaths last year.
   In <PERSON>Bonadonna</PERSON>'s study, chemotherapy was given to women whose
breast tumors were bigger than three centimeters, or just over one
inch. The drugs could bring them down below three centimeters in <PERCENT>87
percent</PERCENT> of the women.
   The largest tumor was over four inches across and was shrunken
small enough so doctors could perform a lumpectomy. The average
size of the tumors before treatment was two inches.
   After the operations, the doctors treated the women with
radiation therapy and additional chemotherapy.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new study suggests that women under 45 who
use birth control pills face a greater risk of breast cancer _ a
finding that contradicts earlier research.
   The study results were being presented today at a hearing of the
<ORGANIZATION>Food and Drug Administration</ORGANIZATION>.
   Researchers at the <ORGANIZATION>Boston University School of Medicine</ORGANIZATION> found
that women who used oral contraceptives had twice the risk of breast
cancer compared to women who have never used the pill.
   For women who have used the pill for 10 years or more, the study
found, the risk of breast cancer was four times greater.
   The issue is of particular concern because oral contraceptives
are the most popular form of birth control in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, and
breast cancer is the second most common fatal cancer in women.
   An estimated 13.2 million American women take birth control
pills, according to the <ORGANIZATION>Alan Guttmacher Institute</ORGANIZATION>, which specializes
in reproductive biology.
   About 42,000 women die of breast cancer each year, according to
the <ORGANIZATION>American Cancer Society</ORGANIZATION>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Boston University</ORGANIZATION> findings were based on a study of 407 women
with breast cancer and a cancer-free control group of 424. All were
patients in hospitals in <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION>.
   Dr. <PERSON>Samuel Shapiro</PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION>Slone Epidemiology Unit</ORGANIZATION> at
<ORGANIZATION>Boston University</ORGANIZATION>, said in a news release the new study contradicts
findings in earlier studies, which indicated there was no
association between use of the pill and development of breast cancer.
   ``Whereas early studies, including our own, were reassuring about
the use of oral contraceptives and the risk of breast cancer, recent
studies reopen the question, but do not, by any means, answer it,''
said <PERSON>Shapiro</PERSON>.
   The effect of the new findings, the researchers said, is to show
that further studies are needed ``to reconcile the different
findings and to overcome the methodologic limitations of earlier
ones.''
   A recent study by <PERSON>Dr. Clifford R. Kay</PERSON> and <PERSON>Philip C. Hannaford</PERSON> of
<LOCATION>Manchester</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>, found no overall increase in breast cancer
among women who had taken birth control pills, but did find a
threefold increase in breast cancers in women 30 to 34 years old who
were former pill users. There was no elevation in breast cancer
rates among women who were younger or older than this group.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Boston University</ORGANIZATION> researchers said it is possible the results
of their study were biased and the association between oral
contraceptives and breast cancer ``may not be one of cause and
effect.''
   Further details of the study were to be revealed at the <ORGANIZATION>FDA</ORGANIZATION>
hearing and will be published next month in the <ORGANIZATION>American Journal of
Epidemiology</ORGANIZATION>.
   Oral contraceptives are pills that generally contain a
combination of the hormones estrogen and progestin. Usually taken
daily for three weeks, the pills prevent conception by inhibiting
ovulation.
   In recent years, the amount of hormone in each pill has generally
been reduced as researchers learned that higher doses were unneeded
to prevent conception.
   Side effects, some of them serious, have been experienced among
some women taking the pill, but the accepted medical practice now is
to prescribe the pill for healthy women until the age of 35. Women
over that age, particularly smokers, who have used the pill for more
than five years are known to be at greater risk for heart attack and
stroke.

Chemotherapy undergone before radiation treatment doubled the survival rate of 
a group of patients with the most common type of inoperable lung cancer, 
according to a national study released <DATE>today</DATE> in the <ORGANIZATION>New England Journal of 
Medicine</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Of the patients who underwent only radiation therapy, <PERCENT>11%</PERCENT> survived three years 
after treatment, contrasted with <PERCENT>23%</PERCENT> who underwent five weeks of chemotherapy 
followed by six weeks of daily radiation therapy, according to the lead author 
of the study, <PERSON>Dr. Robert O. Dillman</PERSON>, medical director of the <ORGANIZATION>Hoag Cancer Center</ORGANIZATION> 
in <LOCATION>Newport Beach</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"The good news is that just by adding that little bit of chemotherapy, there 
was a doubling in the survival rate," <PERSON>Dillman</PERSON> said. "The bad news is that still 
didn't help about <PERCENT>75%</PERCENT> of the patients." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. <PERSON>John Glaspy</PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION>'s joint oncology clinic, said the study 
proves there are benefits to chemotherapy. But he noted that even the improved 
survival rates in the study were not good. 
</P>
<P>
"The big point to the reader is, you'd better quit smoking -- quick," <PERSON>Glaspy</PERSON> 
said. "Because these big breakthroughs are changing survival rates by four 
months (on average), and that ain't much." 
</P>
<P>
The three-year study began in <DATE>1984</DATE> and examined 155 patients with inoperable 
non-small-cell lung cancer, which affects as many as 40,000 Americans, <PERSON>Dillman</PERSON> 
said. 
</P>
<P>
It was sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION>National Cancer Institute</ORGANIZATION> and conducted by a 
cooperative group of oncologists from <PERSON>Hoag</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Massachusetts General Hospital</ORGANIZATION> in 
<LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Dartmouth College</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New Hampshire</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>UC San Diego</LOCATION> Medical Center, <ORGANIZATION>McGill 
University</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Montreal</LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>University of Missouri</ORGANIZATION> in <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Patients with this kind of inoperable cancer were given a five-week course of 
chemotherapy -- two doses of the drug cisplatin and five doses of vinblastine. 
The duration was short enough so that patients were able to tolerate the side 
effects of the chemotherapy and still benefit from radiation treatment, <PERSON>Dillman</PERSON> 
said. 
</P>
<P>
This was followed by six weeks of daily treatments of high-dose radiation 
therapy, concentrated on the chest area where the cancer was visible, <PERSON>Dillman</PERSON> 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Major tumor shrinkage was seen in <PERCENT>44%</PERCENT> of the patients who got both chemotherapy 
and radiation, contrasted with <PERCENT>35%</PERCENT> in patients who received only radiation, the 
study said. 
</P>
<P>
After one year of treatment, <PERCENT>55%</PERCENT> of those who underwent chemotherapy and 
radiation therapy survived, contrasted with <PERCENT>40%</PERCENT> among the radiation-only group. 
Three years after treatment, <PERCENT>23%</PERCENT> of the chemotherapy-radiation group had 
survived, contrasted with <PERCENT>11%</PERCENT> for the radiation-only group. 
</P>
<P>
The three-year study was followed by three more years of tracking the patients 
and analyzing the data, <PERSON>Dillman</PERSON> said. At last count, three of the chemotherapy- 
radiation patients were still alive more than four years after treatment. Two 
were from <ORGANIZATION>Massachusetts General Hospital</ORGANIZATION> and one from <ORGANIZATION>McGill University</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
A confirming study sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION>National Cancer Institute</ORGANIZATION> is under way 
across the country. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Dillman</PERSON> said the key finding is that chemotherapy, especially in earlier 
stages, is more effective in lung cancer than many doctors realize. 
</P>
<P>
"Most patients with lung cancer are diagnosed by family practitioners or 
general internists, and they often have their initial care and treatment 
decisions made by those physicians," <PERSON>Dillman</PERSON> said. "We know now that if we wait 
until (final stages of lung cancer) then chemotherapy is really too late. 
Patients will have severe side effects, won't tolerate the therapy, and it 
won't help."

  [Text] Viral hepatitis infections surged in <DATE>1992</DATE>, with 
more than twice as many cases recorded as in the previous year, 
according to statistics just released by the <ORGANIZATION>Department of 
Health</ORGANIZATION>. More people were also diagnosed as having sexually 
transmitted diseases, died of lung cancer and heart disease, or 
were admitted to hospital because of injury or poisoning. 
  The department's annual report for 1992-93 shows that 4,357 
hepatitis cases were reported in <DATE>1992</DATE> compared with 1,801 in 
<DATE>1991</DATE>. Almost all were hepatitis A, 157 were hepatitis B and 301 
were classified as neither A nor B. The report said the 
infections were due to eating raw or badly cooked seafood from 
<LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION>'s polluted waters. Other figures in the report show 
<LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> people died from the same serious diseases, in about 
the same proportions, in <DATE>1992</DATE> as in the previous year. 
  The biggest killers were cancers, heart diseases and 
cerebrovascular diseases, which together accounted for almost 
two-thirds of all deaths. As in the previous year, lung cancer 
killed more men and women than any other tumour, causing 2,761 
deaths in <DATE>1992</DATE>. Most of these were due to smoking, the 
department said. 
  Liver cancer and naspharyngeal cancer were the second and 
third most common tumours among men, compared to breast and 
colon cancer among women. Although slightly fewer people died 
of a heart attack in <DATE>1992</DATE> -- 1,785 men and women -- overall 
deaths from heart disease rose by about 400, to 5,359. 
  More babies died in that year because they were born too 
small. Almost <PERCENT>24 percent</PERCENT> (83 deaths) of infant mortalities in 
<DATE>1992</DATE> were blamed on immaturity, compared with about <PERCENT>15 percent</PERCENT> 
(67 deaths) the previous year. 
  A staggering 82,800 patients were treated in hospital 
because 
of injury and poisoning in <DATE>1992</DATE>, making the category the leading 
cause of hospital admission. Of the 1,693 deaths from injury and 
poisoning -- the fifth biggest cause of death in <DATE>1992</DATE> -- almost 
<PERCENT>45 percent</PERCENT> were self inflicted or due to suicide. The other 
main causes of hospital admission were circulatory diseases 
(67,800), cancer (65,000) and normal delivery (54,600). 
  Nearly 3,000 more people were diagnosed with sexually 
transmitted diseases in <DATE>1992</DATE>, making a total of 13,257 cases. 
Almost <PERCENT>60 percent</PERCENT> of these were in men aged between 2040 years. 
One man died from syphilis. 
  More than 5,000 people were treated in hospital for "the 
effects of a foreign body entering through orifice," while about 
2,560 were admitted because of complications arising from 
previous medical or surgical care. 
  Doctors were unable to diagnose the illness in about 11,300 
cases. Almost 3,400 people died because they were killed or 
fatally injured by other people. One person died because of 
injuries resulting from "operation of war" in <DATE>1992</DATE>, the report 
says.

<HL> Mammograms for Women Aged 40-49 Would Cut Cancer Risks -- At High Cost </HL>

<TEXT>
   A woman who undergoes an X-ray breast examination every year during her 40s would cut her risk of dying of breast cancer by <PERCENT>26%</PERCENT>. 

   But urging annual mammography for all women between ages 40 and 50 years would boost the nation's medical bill by more than <MONEY>$400 million</MONEY> for the year <DATE>2000</DATE> while saving 373 women from dying of breast cancer that year. 

   So concluded an unusual cost-benefit analysis of X-ray mammography by researchers from <ORGANIZATION>Duke University</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>American Medical Association</ORGANIZATION>, published this week in the association's journal. 

   The analysis sought to determine the benefits, risks and costs of recommending annual mammography for women in their 40s. 
Most medical groups currently agree that women age 50 and over should have annual mammography examinations. 
Breast cancer is most common among older women, and a variety of studies show that such annual exams can reduce the number of breast-cancer deaths among women over 50 by <PERCENT>50%</PERCENT> over a five-year period. 

   Medical groups disagree, however, on the value of mammography for women in their 40s, when mammography is less effective in detecting early cancers. 
The <ORGANIZATION>American Cancer Society</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>American Medical Association</ORGANIZATION> urge women to have at least one mammogram taken between age 35 and 40 and have additional mammograms every year or two through age 49. 
But the federal government's <ORGANIZATION>National Cancer Institute</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>American College of Obstetricians</ORGANIZATION> and Gynecologists and others have declined to recommend mammography in this age group except for women with a family history of breast cancer. 

   The analysis looked first at the individual benefits and risks of annual mammograms for a 40-year-old woman who hasn't any suspicious breast lumps upon physical examination. 
The odds are 128 out of 10,000 that she will develop breast cancer before she is 50, the analysis found. 
Her chances of dying of a breast cancer that develops during this time is 82 out of 10,000. 
However, these odds are reduced to 60 out of 10,000 if she undergoes annual mammography during her 40s, a <PERCENT>26%</PERCENT> reduction in the risk of dying of a breast cancer that develops before age 50. 

   The estimates take into account that there's a 1-in-25,000 chance that the annual X-rays, themselves, will cause a breast cancer. 
However, there also is a 1-in-100 chance that after each mammogram the woman will require a surgical biopsy for a suspicious feature on the X-ray film that turns out to be noncancerous. 

   For society as a whole, the researchers assumed that, if it were formally recommended, about 4.5 million women in their 40s, or <PERCENT>25%</PERCENT> of women in this age group, would be following this annual practice in the year <DATE>2000</DATE>. 
If so, they calculated, there would be 10,339 deaths that year among women who developed breast cancer sometime between age 40 and 49. 
This would be 373 fewer deaths than if none of the 4.5 million women had been having annual mammograms. 

   The cost of annual mammography in the year <DATE>2000</DATE> for 4.5 million women would be <MONEY>$361 million</MONEY> in <DATE>1984</DATE> dollars, they estimated. 
The cost of biopsies for women who turn out to be "false-positives" would add almost <MONEY>$41 million</MONEY> to the annual medical bill without helping to reduce the death rate. 

   The annual-mammography policy would save about <MONEY>$5.2 million</MONEY> in expensive terminal care that year for women who otherwise would have died of breast cancer. 
However, this would be more than offset by almost <MONEY>$5.9 million</MONEY> spent on trying to cure those women who were found by mammography to have cancer. 

   The net cost of the annual-mammography policy for this age group, after taking into account other medical costs, would be <MONEY>$402 million</MONEY> in the <DATE>year 2000</DATE>, they calculated. 

   Put another way, it requires more than 12,000 mammography exams in the <DATE>year 2000</DATE>, at a cost of more than <MONEY>$1 million</MONEY>, to reduce the number of breast-cancer deaths by one, they calculated. 

   The researchers didn't take sides on whether medical groups should recommend annual mammography for women in their 40s. 
But they did suggest that "mammography should be made available to women who understand the limits of its benefits, who understand its risks, and who are willing to pay its costs." 
A survey of 21 medical centers found the cost of a mammography exam ranges between <MONEY>$35</MONEY> and <MONEY>$182</MONEY>. 
A biopsy resulting from a suspicious mammogram cost about <MONEY>$900</MONEY> in <DATE>1984</DATE>, they noted.

<HEAD>Genetic Testing May Determine Likelihood of Cancer Spread</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Genetic tests on women with breast cancer
could determine the risk of recurrence for some patients, improving
the chance of treating women generally thought to be safe, a
researcher said <DATE>Friday</DATE>.
   Cancer specialists also report that the use of lumpectomy and
radiation therapy appear to be promising alternatives to breast
removal for a common form of early breast cancer.
   The scientists' findings are being presented this week at the
<ORGANIZATION>American College of Radiology</ORGANIZATION>'s 24th annual <ORGANIZATION>National Conference on
Breast Cancer</ORGANIZATION>.
   Genetic, or DNA, tests are run on some women, usually those with
large tumors, to reveal whether cells are dividing rapidly and the
cancer is expected to spread, said <PERSON>Dr. Eva Rubin</PERSON>, chief of the
mammography section at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Alabama</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Birmingham</LOCATION>.
   But a new study shows that similar genetic irregularities
indicating aggressive cancer show up in large and small tumors, a
finding that could signal doctors to begin additional treatment to
fight recurrence, <PERSON>Rubin</PERSON> said.
   Currently, women with small cancerous breast tumors that have
not spread to the lymph nodes have surgery or a lumpectomy with
radiation therapy, <PERSON>Rubin</PERSON> said. Most do not receive follow-up
chemotherapy or hormonal therapy. But <PERCENT>30 percent</PERCENT> of those patients
later die from recurring cancer, she said.
   The <LOCATION>Birmingham</LOCATION> test was designed to determine if DNA test
results were different for larger tumors that can be felt, and
non-palpable cancerous tumors, she said.
   ``Of the 21 palpable and 24 non-palpable cancers we reviewed, we
found that DNA characteristics of small tumors are the same as
larger tumors,'' <PERSON>Rubin</PERSON> said.
   A DNA test on tissue taken in a biopsy can show if the cells are
rapidly dividing and if the DNA has more or fewer chromosomes than
the normal 46. If the tumor is growing and the DNA test is
abnormal, the patient's cancer is likely to be aggressive, <PERSON>Rubin</PERSON>
said.
   The study does not mean that all patients with breast cancer
should have the DNA test to find out whether the tumor is
aggressive, <PERSON>Rubin</PERSON> said, adding that more research and tests are
needed before recommendations are made.
   <ORGANIZATION>Yale University</ORGANIZATION> researchers, meanwhile, said they found that a
lumpectomy _ removing a cancerous tumor and some surrounding tissue
_ combined with radiation therapy can be a good alternative to a
mastectomy.
   Traditionally, the treatment for early cancer limited to the
ducts in the breast has been to remove the breast, said <PERSON>Dr. Bruce
Haffty</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Yale</ORGANIZATION>'s department of therapeutic radiology.
   But a study of 58 patients at <ORGANIZATION>New Haven Hospital</ORGANIZATION> shows a high
success rate using the less radical surgical procedure, he said.
Only three of the patients had recurring cancer.
   The women studied had received treatment from two to 10 years
earlier. The median follow-up time was four years after treatment.
   ``Though we feel it is highly unlikely we have compromised
patients in using this more conservative treatment, we will need to
follow them for 10 to 20 years,'' he said.
   If the cancer returns after a breast-saving lumpectomy is
performed, a mastectomy could still be an option, <PERSON>Haffty</PERSON> said.
   Some physicians are reluctant to use the breast-saving treatment
for early duct cancer, believing that the breast should be removed
if there is any chance that the cancer could recur.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Yale</ORGANIZATION> study so far does not bear out this concern, <PERSON>Haffty</PERSON>
said.
   ``A main message here is that it's important for women to be
screened by mammography so these tumors can be picked up earlier,
treated more conservatively and this will give the patient a much
better prognosis,'' he said.

<HEAD>Studies Show Hormones And Drugs Improve Breast Cancer Survival</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Studies of nearly 29,000 breast-cancer patients
leave no doubt that drug and hormone therapies improve chances of
surviving the disease, the second-leading cancer killer of American
women, researchers say.
   Analysis of 61 studies showed that a synthetic hormone called
tamoxifen improves the survival of breast cancer victims over age
50, while chemotherapy helps younger women.
   During the first five years after treatment, tamoxifen reduced
the odds of death among older women by about one-fifth, the analysis
revealed, while a combination of chemotherapy drugs reduced the odds
by about one-quarter for younger victims.
   The studies were started as far back as 20 years ago.
   The analysis ``has established beyond reasonable doubt that both
tamoxifen and cytotoxic chemotherapy can reduce five-year
mortality,'' the researchers wrote in today's New England Journal of
Medicine.
   The treatments already are widely used for women after surgery to
remove breast tumors. In most of those studied, the disease had
spread to their lymph nodes but hadn't invaded other organs.
   ``There have been continued critics who argue that either
chemotherapy or tamoxifen or both used early on didn't change
survival,'' said <PERSON>Dr. I. Craig Henderson</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Dana-Farber Cancer
Institute</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Henderson</PERSON>, one of 79 co-authors of the analysis, said that while
the treatments do not necessarily cure the cancer, the review shows
that ``they substantially delay death.''
   Many of the studies in the analysis were too small to clearly
demonstrate any effect from the treatments. But after their results
were combined, the impact became apparent.
   The overview method ``takes out the wrinkles from all the
studies,'' said <PERSON>Dr. Nicholas Robert</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>New England Medical Center</ORGANIZATION>.
``We can use conclusions with a strong statistical foundation about
the benefit and lack of benefit of treatments.''
   Breast cancer is second to lung cancer as a cancer killer of
American women. An estimated 135,000 new cases of breast cancer were
diagnosed in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> this year, and 42,300 women died of
the disease.
   Many cancer specialists already are familiar with the findings,
since they have been presented at medical meetings during the past
three years.
   ``These data have already had a major impact on the way women are
treated in this country. Now physicians will have the actual numbers
in hand,'' said another co-author, <PERSON>Dr. William Wood</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Massachusetts
General Hospital</ORGANIZATION>.
   The data were reviewed by a consensus panel of the <ORGANIZATION>National
Institutes of Health</ORGANIZATION> before it recommended in <DATE>1985</DATE> that tamoxifen
and chemotherapy be used for breast cancer that has spread to the
lymph nodes.
   Last <DATE>May</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>National Cancer Institute</ORGANIZATION> told doctors that the
treatment could be extended to women in the earliest stages of
breast cancer that is not yet evident in the lymph nodes. The
institute based its recommendation on three unpublished studies
showing that cancer was slower to return when these women were
treated after surgery to remove their tumors.
   However, that recommendation remains controversial. Some
specialists contend that tamoxifen and chemotherapy should not be
routinely given to women with very early breast cancer until there
is proof that the treatment actually makes them live longer. Others
say that even if the drugs don't lengthen survival, they still may
improve the quality of women's lives by giving them more time
without cancer.
   Chemotherapy often carries unpleasant side effects, such as
nausea and hair loss. Tamoxifen is much milder, although some women
complain of hot flashes, but its long-term effects on the body are
not known.
   Many doctors are reluctant to subject all women with early breast
cancer to these powerful medicines, especially when many will remain
free of cancer with surgery alone.
   The analysis was organized by <PERSON>Dr. Richard Peto</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Oxford
University</ORGANIZATION> and combined the results of 61 comparison studies,
conducted mostly in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION>, on 28,896 women. The
researchers sought out all the studies that had been conducted,
including those that found no benefit of treatment, since these are
less likely than positive studies to be published in medical
journals.
   ``We wanted the whole story,'' said Wood. ``The goal was to be
comprehensive.''

Fighting Cancer: The Food Cures --
For Some of Us, a Change in Diet
May Stop, or Even Reverse, the Disease

   YOU ARE what you eat was the crunchy-granola generation's recipe for promoting long life and good health through diet. 

   These days, though, the pseudo-science of macrobiotic disciples is giving way quickly to the hard science of highly regarded researchers. 
They're demonstrating certain foods and nutritional supplements indeed can prevent, perhaps even treat, diseases such as cancer. 

   Since <DATE>1980</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>National Cancer Institute</ORGANIZATION> aggressively has supported research into whether diet and the use of drugs derived from natural nutrients can protect people from cancer. 
The government's arbiter of established cancer science, <ORGANIZATION>NCI</ORGANIZATION> has assembled a list of 550 substances believed to be potentially protective against cancer. 

   The <ORGANIZATION>NCI</ORGANIZATION> decided to throw its scientific weight behind the research because, it says, "mounting evidence" from laboratory studies and surveys of large groups of people found that "various agents could halt or reverse cancer progression in animals or reduce the incidence or risk of cancer in humans." 

   Even though much of the new science is just emerging, and many of the NCI-backed studies won't be finished for several years, researchers already are drawing a picture of those individuals who may benefit most from dietary changes. 
Some studies may show that certain nutrients can stop or reverse cancers in people already exposed to known or suspected cancer-causing agents, or carcinogens. 
Other studies may find that drugs based on these nutrients can slow or block the onset of disease. 

   Vitamin A and Beta-Carotene
   A major objective of the NCI-backed research is to clarify the benefits of vitamin A and beta-carotene, a natural substance the body converts into vitamin A. 
There is growing, although still undefinitive, proof that vitmain A can lower the risk of lung cancer, especially among men, and men who have smoked in particular. 
Meanwhile, very recent research indicates that vitamin A may help prevent cancer of the colon, stomach, prostate, cervix, and breast. 

   Vitamin A is found in liver, eggs and milk. 
An even more common source of the vitamin is beta-carotene in leafy green and yellow vegetables, such as carrots, winter squash, spinach, canteloupe and broccoli. 

   Scientists aren't certain how vitamin A and beta-carotene may act to forestall cancer, but some lab research suggests that the nutrients interfere with the proteins that cancer cells use in reproduction and growth. 
Other research indicates that beta-carotene that isn't converted into vitamin A deactivates oxygen molecules produced by carcinogens and believed to trigger malignant tissue growth. 

   In a study expected to end in <DATE>1990</DATE>, scientists are giving vitamin A and two other nutrients, vitamin E and selenium, to tin miners at risk of developing lung cancer, to determine if the nutrients cut the incidence of disease. 
Other studies, some with tens of thousands of subjects, are researching whether certain levels of vitamin A consumption can prevent lung cancer in smokers and asbestos workers. 
One research team is trying to block the development of cervical cancer in women who have a pre-cancerous condition by administering a topical cream made of a vitamin A-like chemical. 

   High doses of pure vitamin A can be toxic, however. 
It can produce birth defects and other problems, and its intake should be limited to the normal amounts found in food, researchers say. 

   Vitamins C and E
   Several years ago, scientists discovered that nitrates and nitrites, substances found in processed foods such as bacon and hot dogs, are transformed by the body into nitrosamines, a suspected carcinogen. 
New reserach has found that vitamins C and E block the formation of nitrosamines. 

   This finding may explain why certain populations whose diets are rich in fruits, vegetables and vegetable oils containing the vitamins have low incidence of cancer of the stomach and digestive tract, where the nitrosamines develop. 

   One study found that Japanese who migrated to <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION> had a lower rate of stomach cancer than would have been expected if they stayed in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>. 
The reason was that fresh fruits and vegetables are readily available in <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>, but not in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>. 
A study at <ORGANIZATION>Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION> also found that among a group of men who were smokers, those with low levels of vitamin E in their blood had a 2.5 times greater risk of developing lung cancer than those with higher levels of the vitamin. 

   Several studies are testing whether food containing vitamin C or E, or vitamin supplement pills, can inhibit the development of colon cancer in patients with a history of developing the type of polyps that are thought to be a precursor of the disease. 

   Selenium
   The natural element selenium occurs in some foods, such as seafood, meats from certain organs, and grains grown in ground rich in the chemical. 
Although selenium in high doses can be very toxic, lab studies of cancer cells in test tubes and in animals show that certain forms of selenium can block cancer-cell growth. 
Population studies in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, especially in the <LOCATION>Northeast</LOCATION>, suggest that people with low selenium in their diets have higher rates of colon, breast and prostate cancer. 

   Most research right now is trying to determine levels at which selenium consumption won't produce toxicity. 
The studies are following people who live in areas of the country, such as <LOCATION>South Dakota</LOCATION>, where selenium intake is high. 

   Fats &amp; Fibers
   The <ORGANIZATION>U.S. National Research Council</ORGANIZATION> says the evidence indicting animal fat as a cause for cancer, especially of colon and breast cancer, is so damning that the council recommends that most Americans decrease their consumption of fats. 
Moreover, some populations demonstrate that high-fiber diets protect against the effects of eating fat. 
Fiber is found in fruits, vegetables and whole-grain products such as whole-grain cereals, breads and brown rice. 

   Scientists aren't certain which of these foods provide the greatest protection, nor how fiber works. 
It is believed, however, fiber more quickly rids the body of fat that may produce unwanted effects. 

   In one study of laboratory rats, scientists induced tumors of the colon in animals fed all-fat diets, while animals with diets of fat and fiber had a lower rate of cancer. 
One population study reported in <DATE>1983</DATE> found that people in <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Wales</LOCATION> whose consumption of sugar, meat and fat were sharply reduced during World War II had a marked reduction of cancer of the breast and colon. 
After the war, the rates climbed back to pre-war levels. 

   The <ORGANIZATION>NCI</ORGANIZATION> also is supporting research looking at the combined effects in the diet of many nutrients. 
A researcher at <ORGANIZATION>Memorial Sloan-Kettering Hospital</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> is testing whether a combination of beta-carotene and vitamins C and E can prevent the development of skin cancer lesions in people who previously had a tumor growth.

<HEAD>Panel Says Preserving Breast in Early Cancer Doesn't Affect
Survival</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A panel of experts says removing a cancerous
tumor in the early stages of breast cancer gives as good a survival
chance to women as more radical surgery in which the entire breast
is removed.
   Mastectomies, in which the entire breast is removed, and
lumpectomies, in which only the tumor is removed, both give
``excellent'' results for Stage I and Stage II breast cancer, the
panel said.
   The committee of 15 experts was assembled by the <ORGANIZATION>National
Institutes of Health</ORGANIZATION> to consider research on the survival of women
with early stages of breast cancer and to develop a consensus on
what therapy should be used to treat the disease.
   ``The therapies appear to be equivalent in survival,'' said <PERSON>Dr.
William C. Wood</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Harvard Medical School</ORGANIZATION> surgeon and chairman of
the committee. ``We believe it is preferable to preserve an organ.''
   Mastectomy is still the most commonly used therapy for early
stage breast cancer, <ORGANIZATION>Wood</ORGANIZATION> said. A lumpectomy is followed with
radiation therapy, and <ORGANIZATION>Wood</ORGANIZATION> said some patients choose mastectomy
because they ``prefer to lose a breast instead of have six weeks of
radiation therapy.''
   In its report, the committee said surgery in which the breast is
saved, or conserved, ``is an appropriate method of primary therapy
for the majority of women with Stage I and II breast cancer, and is
preferable'' because the breast is preserved and the survival
chances are the same as for mastectomy.
   Wood said that both mastectomy and lumpectomy involves the
removal of nearby lymph nodes. If these nodes are cancer-free and
the primary tumor is smaller than one centimeter, both methods of
treatment have about a <PERCENT>90 percent</PERCENT> chance of cure.
   About 150,000 American women will be diagnosed with breast
cancer this year, the committee report said. Between <PERCENT>75 percent</PERCENT> and
<PERCENT>80 percent</PERCENT> of this group will have Stage I or Stage II disease, and
about two-thirds of these will have cancer-free lymph nodes.
   Stage I and II cancers have not spread beyond the breast and
lymph nodes. But just how to treat this early-stage breast cancer
long has been controversial.
   Traditionally, the preferred treatment has been a radical
mastectomy in which the entire breast and much adjacent tissue is
removed. During the <DATE>past two decades</DATE>, there have been a number of
studies comparing the survival results of less extensive breast
surgery, including lumpectomy.
   The committee found that, based on the studies, survival rates
are virtually the same for the two types of therapy.
   The experts said the picture was less clear for follow-up
treatment using chemotherapy or a drug that blocks the hormone
estrogen. The studies show a trend that may suggest an advantage in
taking the follow up or adjuvant therapy, but the committee said
the drugs may be toxic or degrade the patient's quality of life.
   For patients with very small primary tumors _ one centimeter or
less _ adjuvant therapy is not required, the committee said.
   The committee also said that the use of lumpectomy should be
based on an individual evaluation of each patient and with the full
understanding by the patient of all the options. Lumpectomies are
not appropriate for all Stage I or II patients because of the size
of the breast, or the distribution of tumors or calcified lumps
within the breast, the committee said.

   Medicine:
   Possible Tool
   To Spot Cancer
   In Colon Found

   An internationally acclaimed team of scientists found a
gene that appears to trigger the initial transformation of a
healthy cell into cancer.
   The discovery by scientists at Johns Hopkins University
may soon provide doctors with a powerful way to predict if a
tumor is beginning to rise amidst the normal tissue cells in
the human colon. Such a diagnostic tool may go a long way
toward catching colon cancers at an early stage when they can
be successfully treated. Colon cancer is the third most
common deadly form of cancer, after cancer of the lung and
breast.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "The potential for using this gene in early detection of
the cancer is very exciting to us," said <PERSON>Bert Vogelstein</PERSON>, the
molecular biologist whose laboratory made the discovery.
"Colon cancer can be very lethal, but it only is dangerous
when it's allowed to advance to the point that it spreads to
other tissue. Caught early the disease is completely
treatable."
   The new gene is the third of its type found in the last
two years by <PERSON>Dr. Vogelstein</PERSON>'s lab, and is the last of four
genes believed to be involved in the development of colon
cancer. The three genes found by the <PERSON>Johns Hopkins</PERSON> group are
dubbed tumor suppressors because scientists believe in their
normal state they govern cell growth. If these genes somehow
become defective, however, cells under their control can
begin to grow aberrantly and turn cancerous.
   The discovery of tumor suppressor genes has become a
watershed in cancer research, proving that a cell progresses
into a lethal tumor by steps. The cell turns increasingly
dangerous over time -- perhaps many years -- as its numerous
growth-controlling tumor suppressor genes, bit by bit, become
defective.
   In <DATE>1989</DATE>, <PERSON>Dr. Vogelstein</PERSON>'s lab found a gene, called p53,
that when defective can kick a growing colon cancer tumor
into a final stage of malignancy. Since then, scientists
elsewhere have found defective versions of p53 in cancers of
the brain, breast and lung. Scientists also have found that
re-inserting a normal version p53 in cancerous cells in a
test tube can block further tumor growth, providing evidence
that turning the gene on through drugs may provide a potent
type of cancer medicine.
   In <DATE>January 1990</DATE>, <PERSON>Dr. Vogelstein</PERSON>'s lab found another
suppressor gene called <ORGANIZATION>DCC</ORGANIZATION>, deleted in colorectal cancer. The
most recent discovery is a gene being called <ORGANIZATION>MCC</ORGANIZATION>, for mutated
in colorectal cancer.
   The latest gene discovery is especially exciting,
scientists said, because it is the result of a world-wide
search that has been going on for about five years. The <ORGANIZATION>MCC</ORGANIZATION>
gene appears to be the same gene that researchers at the
<ORGANIZATION>University of Utah</ORGANIZATION> and in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> believe can be inherited in
a mutant form and cause a rare familial form of colon cancer.
The <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION> and British scientists have been studying the
genetic material of several families where numerous relatives
have a tendency to grow dozens of polyps in their colon, tiny
clumps of mushroom-sized growth which under certain
circumstances can become cancerous.
   Several years ago, the scientists had tracked the
inherited gene to chromosome 5 -- all cells have two pairs of
23 chromosomes upon which all human genes reside. At about
the same time, researchers at <PERSON>Johns Hopkins</PERSON> had found
evidence in sifting through genetic material taken from colon
cancer cells suggesting that a tumor suppressor gene also
existed on chromosome 5. Believing the two genes might be the
same, about two years ago the <PERSON>Johns Hopkins</PERSON> researchers
joined forces with the <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION> team and another group from
<LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Cancer Institute</ORGANIZATION> to pinpoint the gene's exact
identity.
   In a report in the journal Science, the three labs say
they have isolated the gene, calling it <ORGANIZATION>MCC</ORGANIZATION>. "We don't know
for certain that it is exactly the gene that is inherited by
the families, but we think it is," <PERSON>Dr. Vogelstein</PERSON> said,
noting that the same gene may also trigger cancer growth in
people who don't inherit the disease.
   In any case, <PERSON>Dr. Vogelstein</PERSON> said he and his colleagues are
convinced that the loss of two copies of a cell's <ORGANIZATION>MCC</ORGANIZATION> gene is
what makes a normal cell begin growing into a polyp. Every
cell contains two copies of each gene, each of which sits on
a cell's two copies of each chromosome. People who inherit
one or two copies of <ORGANIZATION>MCC</ORGANIZATION> already in damaged form are at very
high risk of developing colon cancer, the researchers said.
As a result of the finding, the researchers said that someday
doctors will be able to test patients' blood to detect if
some of their cells have somehow -- perhaps through exposure
to some environmental agent -- collected damaged versions of
<ORGANIZATION>MCC</ORGANIZATION>.
   A patient found to have a damaged <ORGANIZATION>MCC</ORGANIZATION> "would be closely
monitored for any suspicious polyp growths," <PERSON>Dr. Vogelstein</PERSON>
said. "Removing a polyp can remove the risk of cancer."
   The gene was pinpointed in the <PERSON>Johns Hopkins</PERSON> lab by
<PERSON>Kenneth Kinzler</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Mef Nilbert</ORGANIZATION>. They and <PERSON>Dr. Vogelstein</PERSON>
believe the <ORGANIZATION>MCC</ORGANIZATION> gene in its normal state produces a protein
that acts as a curb for a certain kind of cell growth. They
said that a drug that might mimic the action of the protein
could be a prototype for a new anti-cancer drug.

   A form of asbestos once used to make Kent cigarette filters has caused a high percentage of cancer deaths among a group of workers exposed to it more than 30 years ago, researchers reported. 

   The asbestos fiber, crocidolite, is unusually resilient once it enters the lungs, with even brief exposures to it causing symptoms that show up decades later, researchers said. 
<ORGANIZATION>Lorillard Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, the unit of New York-based <ORGANIZATION>Loews Corp.</ORGANIZATION> that makes Kent cigarettes, stopped using crocidolite in its Micronite cigarette filters in <DATE>1956</DATE>. 

   Although preliminary findings were reported more than a year ago, the latest results appear in today's New England Journal of Medicine, a forum likely to bring new attention to the problem. 

   A <ORGANIZATION>Lorillard</ORGANIZATION> spokewoman said, "This is an old story. 
We're talking about years ago before anyone heard of asbestos having any questionable properties. 
There is no asbestos in our products now." 

   Neither <ORGANIZATION>Lorillard</ORGANIZATION> nor the researchers who studied the workers were aware of any research on smokers of the Kent cigarettes. 
"We have no useful information on whether users are at risk," said <PERSON>James A. Talcott</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Dana-Farber Cancer Institute</ORGANIZATION>. 
<PERSON>Dr. Talcott</PERSON> led a team of researchers from the <ORGANIZATION>National Cancer Institute</ORGANIZATION> and the medical schools of <ORGANIZATION>Harvard University</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Boston University</ORGANIZATION>. 

   The <ORGANIZATION>Lorillard</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman said asbestos was used in "very modest amounts" in making paper for the filters in the early <DATE>1950s</DATE> and replaced with a different type of filter in <DATE>1956</DATE>. 
From <DATE>1953</DATE> to <DATE>1955</DATE>, 9.8 billion Kent cigarettes with the filters were sold, the company said. 

   Among 33 men who worked closely with the substance, 28 have died -- more than three times the expected number. 
Four of the five surviving workers have asbestos-related diseases, including three with recently diagnosed cancer. 
The total of 18 deaths from malignant mesothelioma, lung cancer and asbestosis was far higher than expected, the researchers said. 

   "The morbidity rate is a striking finding among those of us who study asbestos-related diseases," said <PERSON>Dr. Talcott</PERSON>. 

   The percentage of lung cancer deaths among the workers at the <LOCATION>West Groton</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION>, paper factory appears to be the highest for any asbestos workers studied in <LOCATION>Western</LOCATION> industrialized countries, he said. 
The plant, which is owned by <ORGANIZATION>Hollingsworth &amp; Vose Co.</ORGANIZATION>, was under contract with <ORGANIZATION>Lorillard</ORGANIZATION> to make the cigarette filters. 

   The finding probably will support those who argue that the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> should regulate the class of asbestos including crocidolite more stringently than the common kind of asbestos, chrysotile, found in most schools and other buildings, <PERSON>Dr. Talcott</PERSON> said. 

   The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> is one of the few industrialized nations that doesn't have a higher standard of regulation for the smooth, needle-like fibers such as crocidolite that are classified as amphobiles, according to <PERSON>Brooke T. Mossman</PERSON>, a professor of pathlogy at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Vermont College of Medicine</ORGANIZATION>. 
More common chrysotile fibers are curly and are more easily rejected by the body, <PERSON>Dr. Mossman</PERSON> explained. 

   In <DATE>July</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>Environmental Protection Agency</ORGANIZATION> imposed a gradual ban on virtually all uses of asbestos. 
By <DATE>1997</DATE>, almost all remaining uses of cancer-causing asbestos will be outlawed. 

   About 160 workers at a factory that made paper for the Kent filters were exposed to asbestos in the <DATE>1950s</DATE>. 
Areas of the factory were particularly dusty where the crocidolite was used. 
Workers dumped large burlap sacks of the imported material into a huge bin, poured in cotton and acetate fibers and mechanically mixed the dry fibers in a process used to make filters. 
Workers described "clouds of blue dust" that hung over parts of the factory, even though exhaust fans ventilated the area. 

   "There's no question that some of those workers and managers contracted asbestos-related diseases," said <PERSON>Darrell Phillips</PERSON>, vice president of human resources for <ORGANIZATION>Hollingsworth &amp; Vose</ORGANIZATION>. 
"But you have to recognize that these events took place 35 years ago. 
It has no bearing on our work force today."

Advice for avoiding cancer: Don't smoke. Hide from the sun. Eat fruit and
vegetables. Join the upper classes. Employ a chauffeur and don't look out of
the car window.
Epidemiologists estimate 75-80 per cent of all cancers are preventable, in
the sense that they are triggered by features of the individual's lifestyle
and environment. The problem is identifying the avoidable risks. A few are
well known and easy to act on; much the most obvious example is smoking.
Most risks, however, are less well defined and harder to avoid. For
instance, cancer as a whole is more common - and more likely to be fatal -
among the 'lower' social classes. This is true even when the statistics are
adjusted to take account of all known risk factors such as smoking, diet and
access to health care.
Researchers are coming to the conclusion that there is something
intrinsically unhealthy about being near the bottom of the social pecking
order, even if you follow the rules for healthy living. <PERSON>Sally Macintyre</PERSON>,
director of the <ORGANIZATION>Medical Research Council's Medical Sociology Unit</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Glasgow</LOCATION>, says the mechanism of this effect is far from clear, though it
appears that 'repeated psycho-social stress' somehow depresses the immune
system.
Hundreds of different risk factors have been suggested for cancer - some of
them an inextricable part of modern life. For example, Australian research
has shown a statistical correlation between driving and cancer. The theory
is that the brain responds to moving surroundings by priming the body
chemically for movement that never takes place; the resulting chemical
imbalance may trigger cancers. More concern has been expressed about
man-made hormones, particularly in the contraceptive pill. Clinical studies
involving tens of thousands of women have shown no general increase in
cancer among long-term pill users, though some groups may be at slightly
greater risk of developing breast or cervical cancer.
But epidemiologists say people should not be too concerned about minor or
speculative causes of cancer, when smoking and poor diet are so much more
important.
'One of the biggest myths in recent years is that there is a cancer epidemic
caused by exposure to radiation, pollution, pesticides and food additives,'
says Sir <PERSON>Richard Doll</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Imperial Cancer Research Fund</ORGANIZATION>'s cancer studies
unit in <LOCATION>Oxford</LOCATION>. 'These factors have very little to do with the majority of
cancers.'
Epidemiologists are confident tobacco is implicated in about 30 per cent of
cancer deaths in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION>. They are far less sure about food
and drink; a typical estimate is that diet is involved in 35 per cent of
cancer deaths.
Because there can be a delay of several decades between starting to smoke
and the onset of disease, the big rise in lung cancer did not begin until
the <DATE>1940s</DATE> among men and the <DATE>1970s</DATE> among women (see chart). The male lung
cancer rate is falling in countries such as the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> and UK where large
numbers of men gave up smoking in the <DATE>1960s</DATE> and <DATE>1970s</DATE>, but it is rising
throughout the developing world. Female lung cancer rates are increasing
everywhere.
Although lung cancer is the most obvious effect of smoking, 12 other cancers
are linked to the habit, as well as cardiovascular and other diseases.
However, if an individual smoker gives up before becoming ill, he or she can
avoid most of the risk of dying from tobacco. Ten years after stopping, half
of the smoker's additional cancer risk will have disappeared.
In contrast to smoking and lung cancer, there is no cancer epidemic clearly
linked to changing diet. On the contrary, the most striking trend is the
long-term decline in stomach cancer in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION> - a fall
widely attributed to modern methods of food preservation and storage which
prevent the formation of carcinogenic decay products.
Although colo-rectal cancer rates have remained steady for several decades
in the west, those in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> have risen rapidly to European levels - probably
because the Japanese diet has become westernised with more meat and fat
eaten.
Epidemiologists say there is overwhelming evidence that a diet rich in fruit
and vegetables reduces the risk of cancer. But they do not know how the
protective effect works.
A favourite scientific theory is that anti-oxidant nutrients, such as
vitamins E and C and beta-carotene, play a protective role by scavenging
'free radicals' which can damage a cell's genetic material. Food supplements
containing these nutrients have become very popular. as a result, although
there is not yet conclusive clinical evidence to prove their effectiveness.
The next stage, according to speakers at the <ORGANIZATION>UK Biochemical Society
Conference</ORGANIZATION> this week, will be genetic engineering of crops to make more of
these protective nutrients. <PERSON>Catherine Rice-Evans</PERSON>, a biochemistry professor
at <ORGANIZATION>Guy's Hospital</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, predicts: 'The introduction of plants that have
been manipulated to produce more effective anti-oxidants should be possible
within five years.'

   Preliminary studies in mice suggest
that an air pollutant may hasten the spread of cancer within the
body, a researcher said <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
   Mice with cancer that breathed air containing nitrogen dioxide,
which is found in smog, showed higher numbers of cancer-cell
colonies in their lungs than mice than breathed purified air, said
<PERSON>Arnis Richters</PERSON>.
   ``It is very difficult to say at this point, what does it mean
for human populations,'' said <PERSON>Richters</PERSON>, an associate professor of
pathology at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Southern California School of
Medicine</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>.
   He spoke at a science writers seminar sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION>American
Cancer Society</ORGANIZATION>.
   In other presentations, researchers said doctors often overlook
a warning sign for cancer in the mouth, and said a new treatment
strategy appears promising for cancer of the esophagus.
   About 11,500 new cases of cancer of the mouth are diagnosed each
year; an estimated 10,600 new cases of cancer of the esophagus are
expected to be diagnosed this year, and 9,500 people will die from
it.
   In the mouse study, animals breathed air with nitrogen dioxide
levels ranging from 0.25 to 0.5 parts per million. Such levels can
be reached in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>' notoriously dirty air, <PERSON>Richters</PERSON> said.
   After breathing the air for six weeks to six months, the mice
were injected with skin-cancer cells. Sixty days later, their lungs
were examined to see if cancer had colonized there. The mice were
particularly prone to get lung colonies from the skin cancer,
<ORGANIZATION>Richters</ORGANIZATION> said.
   Studies showed that breathing air with nitrogen dioxide damaged
the linings of tiny blood vessels in the lung, which may trap
circulating cancer cells and provide an environment for them to
grow, he said.
   The pollutant also reduced numbers of cells that form part of
the disease-fighting immune system, he said.
   He recommended that cancer specialists try to find places with
filtered air for their patients just before and after surgery, when
more cancer cells may be released into the bloodstream.
   Common cancers in humans that tend to spread to the lung, a
process called metastasis, include those of the colon, breast and
prostate.
   <PERSON>Lance Liotta</PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION>National Cancer Institute</ORGANIZATION>'s section
of tumor invasion and metastasis, said the concept of <ORGANIZATION>Richters</ORGANIZATION>'
paper ``makes sense.''
   Previous work has shown that lung damage can increase the
efficiency of metastasis to the lung, he said.
   But he said it will be difficult to see whether air pollution
raises lung metastasis in humans because so many other factors are
involved.
   In another presentation, <PERSON>Dr. Arthur Mashberg</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Veterans
Administration Medical Center</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>East Orange</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>, said dentists
and doctors often overlook an early sign of cancer of the mouth.
   Doctors tend to look for white growths called leukoplakia as an
early sign of the cancer, but a red lesion that persists for 10 to
14 days with no apparent ongoing irritation is actually more
ominous, he said.
   Only about <PERCENT>11 percent</PERCENT> of leukoplakias are cancerous, but some <PERCENT>64
percent</PERCENT> of red lesions called mucosal erythroplasias are cancerous,
he said.
   The third presentation dealt with treating cancer of the
esophagus.
   Traditional treatment includes radiation or surgery. <PERSON>Dr.
Lawrence Coia</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine</ORGANIZATION>
reported on a combined treatment of chemotherapy and radiation,
without surgery.
   Being able to avoid surgery is an advantage, because the
operation itself is dangerous and survival from the disease still
is low, commented <ORGANIZATION>Roy Sessions of Georgetown University</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>Coia</PERSON> said half of patients whose disease had been confined to
the esophagus lived more than 18 months after the experimental
treatment, with a corresponding figure of eight months for those
with more advanced disease.
   Under traditional treatment with either surgery or radiation,
half of patients die within a year, he said.

<TEXT>
   The nation's rate of death from breast cancer is
increasing and it's worse across the northern states, although
federal cancer specialists can't explain why.
   The annual death rate from breast cancer in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> in
<DATE>1986</DATE>, the latest year available, was 32.8 per 100,000 women, up <PERCENT>5
percent</PERCENT> from <DATE>1979</DATE>'s 31.1, the national <ORGANIZATION>Centers for Disease Control</ORGANIZATION>
reported <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   The mortality rate in <DATE>1986</DATE> was <PERCENT>12 percent</PERCENT> higher for black women
than for white women.
   Breast cancer killed 40,534 women in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> in <DATE>1986</DATE>,
the <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION> said. Still, the disease is survivable in most cases. The
<ORGANIZATION>National Cancer Institute</ORGANIZATION> estimates that <PERCENT>75 percent</PERCENT> of breast cancer
patients live at least another five years.
   The <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION>Delaware</LOCATION>, with an annual breast cancer death rate of
41 per 100,000 women, had a rate nearly double that of <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>, which
was lowest at 23 per 100,000.
   Each of the dozen states with the highest rates was in the
northern half of the country. In contrast, all but three of the
bottom dozen were in the South or <ORGANIZATION>Southwest</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``We don't know why that is,'' said <PERSON>Dr. Robert Hahn</PERSON>, a cancer
specialist with the Atlanta-based <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION>. ``It likely has something to
do with the distribution of risk factors for breast cancer, but we
don't know which ones those are.''
   Overall, breast cancer death rates have increased for women born
in each succeeding decade in this century. For example, <PERSON>Hahn</PERSON> said,
women born in the <DATE>1930s</DATE> are showing a higher rate than those born in
the '20s, whose rate was higher than those born in the teens.
   That trend is apparently continuing, <PERSON>Hahn</PERSON> said, although many
women born in this century are just entering _ or haven't yet
entered _ their years of greatest risk for breast cancer. The <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION>
said more than half of all breast cancer deaths occur in women 65 or
older.
   Breast cancer's risk factors include family history and
childbearing at older ages. Another possible risk factor is a diet
high in animal fat, <PERSON>Hahn</PERSON> said, although some researchers question
that.
   <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION> researchers believe at least <PERCENT>19 percent</PERCENT> of the deaths
attributed to breast cancer could have been prevented if the victims
had undergone recommended mammograms, which screen for breast cancer.
   Women are seven times more likely to have mammograms if their
doctor urges it, but <PERSON>Hahn</PERSON> said that as many as nine out of 10
doctors don't follow the <ORGANIZATION>American Cancer Society</ORGANIZATION>'s advice and
recommend the procedure.
   ``We think it's crucial for physicians to become informed of the
guidelines and recommend to their patients that they get screening
mammograms,'' he said.
   The <ORGANIZATION>American Cancer Society</ORGANIZATION> recommends that women 40 and over
have a breast exam every year. Women 40-49 also should have
mammograms every year or two, and the society advises that women 50
and older should have mammograms each year.
   Previous studies cited by the <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION> have indicated that fewer than
three in 10 eligible women reported having a mammogram in the
previous year, and nearly half of women surveyed said no
professional had ever recommended they get a mammogram.

   Breast Cancer Treatment Sparks Debate

   Like a growing number of U.S. women with breast cancer,
Mary Lupro is afraid she'll never receive a controversial new
treatment.
   Conventional chemotherapy seems to have arrested her
cancer, says the mother of two in Hanover, Pa. But before the
treatments, the cancer had spread to the lymph nodes in her
neck, a sign that it will probably recur in a deadlier,
metastatic form within a few years.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   <PERSON>Mrs. Lupro</PERSON>, 38 years old, believes a new treatment,
involving an "autologous bone marrow transplant," or <ORGANIZATION>ABMT</ORGANIZATION>,
could kill lingering tumor cells and buy her a lot of time.
But her health insurer, <ORGANIZATION>Travelers Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, says the procedure
is still experimental, hence not covered. Without an
insurer's promise to pay, hospitals won't begin the costly
treatment, which employs a dangerous, high-dose blast of
conventional anti-cancer drugs.
   "I'm not as mad as my husband," says <PERSON>Mrs. Lupro</PERSON>, who says
she may sue <ORGANIZATION>Travelers</ORGANIZATION> to get an <ORGANIZATION>ABMT</ORGANIZATION>. "It's harder on him." A
<ORGANIZATION>Travelers</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman says the <PERSON>Lupro</PERSON> case is "being reviewed
with an outside oncologist."
   The Lupros are caught up in one of the nation's fiercest
health-care debates. Preliminary studies on <ORGANIZATION>ABMT</ORGANIZATION> for breast
cancer indicate it may work better than conventional
alternatives for some women. A recent report in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> showed
that about one-third of 258 metastatic breast-cancer patients
treated with <ORGANIZATION>ABMT</ORGANIZATION> after standard chemotherapy showed no signs
of the disease in follow-up periods of 12 to 42 months,
according to <ORGANIZATION>Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.</ORGANIZATION>, which sponsored the
meeting.
   <PERSON>Karen Antman</PERSON>, a researcher at the <ORGANIZATION>Dana-Farber Cancer
Institute</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>, told the meeting that the frequency of
tumor disappearance in certain patients is "much higher" than
with standard chemotherapy.
   But the treatment, which typically costs <MONEY>$100,000</MONEY> or more,
is risky. About <PERCENT>9%</PERCENT> of patients with various stages of breast
cancer have died from complications after the therapy,
according to <PERSON>Dr. Antman</PERSON>. Most doctors say that more data on
<ORGANIZATION>ABMT</ORGANIZATION> is needed to establish whether it's better than
alternative treatments.
   "I think the insurance companies are right. <ORGANIZATION>ABMT</ORGANIZATION> is very
experimental for breast cancer," says <PERSON>Subhash Gulati</PERSON>, chief
of the <ORGANIZATION>ABMT</ORGANIZATION> team at <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>'s Memorial Sloan-Kettering
Cancer Center. Still, he adds, early results with it are
"encouraging," warranting further studies.
   Some doctors are less optimistic. Based on available data,
"I certainly can't conclude that {breast-cancer} patients are
better off with <ORGANIZATION>ABMT</ORGANIZATION>," says <PERSON>David Eddy</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Duke University</ORGANIZATION>
health-policy professor and a consultant to the <ORGANIZATION>Blue Cross &amp;
Blue Shield Association</ORGANIZATION>.
   The stakes in the <ORGANIZATION>ABMT</ORGANIZATION> debate are large. The rate of
breast-cancer incidence in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> has risen sharply in the
past decade, though the mortality rate has held steady. This
year, about 150,000 women will be diagnosed with the disease.
The metastatic form will develop in about <PERCENT>30%</PERCENT> of those women,
with most patients dying within two years.
   Doctors testing <ORGANIZATION>ABMT</ORGANIZATION> for breast cancer estimate that
one-fourth to one-half of metastatic cases may be good
candidates for the procedure -- if it's proved effective.
Physicians also are testing <ORGANIZATION>ABMT</ORGANIZATION> to treat high-risk patients
before metastasis, as well as people with testicular cancer
and melanoma. For certain other cancers, such as leukemia,
<ORGANIZATION>ABMT</ORGANIZATION> already is an accepted treatment covered by insurers.
   "It's too early to say this approach is right for public
consumption," says <PERSON>Jacob Bitran</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>University of Chicago</ORGANIZATION>
cancer researcher testing <ORGANIZATION>ABMT</ORGANIZATION>. "But I've never seen
metastatic breast cancer patients respond as frequently" as
they do with <ORGANIZATION>ABMT</ORGANIZATION>, he says.
   Its promise appears greatest with breast-cancer patients
whose cancers respond to conventional chemotherapy, says
<PERSON>Nancy Davidson</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Johns Hopkins University</ORGANIZATION> researcher. A
higher dose of the same drugs is likely to wipe out even more
breast cancer cells in those patients, she says, raising the
chances of long-term remission. But at high doses, the drugs
cripple the immune system, leaving patients vulnerable to
fatal infections.
   To prevent that, doctors using <ORGANIZATION>ABMT</ORGANIZATION> extract marrow cells
from patients' pelvic bones through needles before giving
them anti-cancer drugs. The extracts contain immune-cell
precursors that, when reinfused after chemotherapy, "rescue"
patients' immune systems. Unlike conventional chemotherapy,
which requires shots over months or years, anti-cancer drugs
with <ORGANIZATION>ABMT</ORGANIZATION> are administered in intense doses over several
days.
   The procedure typically requires three or more weeks of
hospitalization for immune-system recovery. That's what makes
it so expensive. But the advent of "colony stimulating
factors" -- experimental drugs to speed immune-cell growth --
and other recent advances "are knocking four or five days
off" that period, says <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Dr. Bitran</PERSON>. He estimates
that the procedure's costs now are "pretty close" to those of
a typical course of conventional chemotherapy for metastatic
breast cancer.
   The improvements also are narrowing patients' windows of
vulnerability to fatal infections, such as pneumonia. Deaths
from the treatment now occur in about <PERCENT>4%</PERCENT> to <PERCENT>9%</PERCENT> of patients
who are treated by doctors experienced with it, compared with
<PERCENT>20%</PERCENT> in one early study, says <PERSON>Andrew Dorr</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>National Cancer
Institute</ORGANIZATION> researcher.
   <PERSON>Dr. Dorr</PERSON> adds that the <ORGANIZATION>NCI</ORGANIZATION> plans this fall to organize a
large clinical study of the new therapy and breast cancer.
But the study, which doctors agree is sorely needed, may
spark controversies of its own. One issue is whether insurers
should help pay for it.
   In any case, many women feel they don't have time to wait
for definitive studies. One is <PERSON>Pam Pirozzi</PERSON>, a 35-year-old
mother in <LOCATION>Tracy</LOCATION>'s Landing, <LOCATION>Md.</LOCATION>, diagnosed with breast cancer
last year. She sued her insurer, <ORGANIZATION>Blue Cross/Blue Shield</ORGANIZATION> of
<LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION>, to force it to pay for an <ORGANIZATION>ABMT</ORGANIZATION>. Last month, a
federal judge in <LOCATION>Alexandria</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Va.</LOCATION>, ruled in her favor,
potentially setting an important precedent.
   But during her legal battle, says <PERSON>Mrs. Pirozzi</PERSON>, her cancer
spread to her cranium. Now she's undergoing conventional
therapy, hoping to follow it up with <ORGANIZATION>ABMT</ORGANIZATION> this <DATE>fall</DATE>.

<TEXT>     Among <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>'s 15 largest counties in <DATE>1988</DATE>, only <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> exceeded
the overall cancer rate in the nation for males, officials said. The higher
rate is due to the large number of AIDS-related cancers.;    <ORGANIZATION>State Department
of Health Services</ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON>Ken Kizer</PERSON> said during a news conference that the
state's significant populations of Hispanics and Asians have lower rates than
other ethnic groups, which may explain <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>'s overall ranking below the
national rate.;    A report on the <DATE>1987</DATE> and <DATE>1988</DATE> incidence of cancer shows
that rates for the <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> region were the lowest in the state, while
those for the <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Sacramento</LOCATION> and Orange county areas nearly matched
those of the nation.;    <ORGANIZATION>The American Cancer Society</ORGANIZATION> hailed the news of the
lower rates in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, but <ORGANIZATION>University of Southern
California</ORGANIZATION> cancer experts cautioned that the report may provide a distorted
picture.;    <PERSON>Leslie Bernstein</PERSON>, scientific director of the <ORGANIZATION>USC-Los Angeles
County Cancer Surveillance Program</ORGANIZATION>, said the report does not take into account
how populations vary across the state in its region-to-region comparisons.;   
"<LOCATION>Los Angeles County</LOCATION> appears to have low cancer rates because it has more
Asians and Latinos than other counties. The cancer rates of Asians and Latinos
are known to be <PERCENT>30 percent</PERCENT> to <PERCENT>40 percent</PERCENT> lower than those of blacks and
whites," <PERSON>Bernstein</PERSON> said.;    The lower rates for Asians and Hispanics is
believed to be due to their diets.;    Among the major findings of the
report:;    (check) Breast cancer was the most frequently diagnosed cancer in
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION>. In <DATE>1988</DATE>, there were 16,342 cases among <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> women. Overall,
the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> rate was lower in both years than the rate for the nation.;   
(check) Lung cancer was the second most frequently diagnosed cancer in <DATE>1988</DATE>,
with 9,469 cases among men and 6,579 cases among women. It was the leading
form of cancer death, accounting for 7,728 male deaths and 5,021 female deaths
in 1988.;    (check) The median age at diagnosis was 67 years. Thirty percent
of all cancers were diagnosed between ages 65 and 74. Among males, the cancer
rates for men 70-74 were 16.4 times greater than the rates for men 40-44, and
for females in the same age groups, the rates were 6.5 times greater.  </TEXT>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rose <PERSON>Kushner</PERSON>, a medical writer and psychologist
and forceful advocate for women with breast cancer, has died of the
disease at age 60.
   <PERSON>Kushner</PERSON>, who resided in <LOCATION>Kensington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Md.</LOCATION>, died <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, The <ORGANIZATION>New
York Times</ORGANIZATION> reported today.
   She gained national fame in <DATE>1975</DATE>, with the publication of ``Why
Me? What Every Woman Should Know About Breast Cancer to Save Her
Life,'' an account of her own battle with the disease.
   Breast cancer specialists initially rejected many of the steps
she advocated, including less radical surgery, which now are common.
   Kushner focused her energies on the breast cancer crusade in
<DATE>1974</DATE>, when she discovered a lump in her breast but refused to
submit to the then-routine ``one-step'' procedure.
   In the mid-70s, a woman undergoing treatment would be
anesthetized, the lump removed for biopsy, and, if malignant, the
breast would be removed. The patient would not know until she awoke
whether the breast was gone.
   Kushner fought against the one-step procedure, arguing that
women needed time after a diagnosis to find the best surgeon. After
18 phone calls, she finally found a general surgeon who would
remove just the lump.
   Now, the one-step procedure is no longer used.
   ``She is probably the single most important person in leading to
this major change in breast surgery,'' <PERSON>Dr. Bruce A. Chabner</PERSON> once
said. Chabner is the director of the division of cancer treatment
at the <ORGANIZATION>National Cancer Institute</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Bethesda</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Md.</LOCATION> ``I don't think
the public would have accepted it or even known about it if she had
not been so persistent in her efforts.''
   <PERSON>Kushner</PERSON> founded and was director of the <ORGANIZATION>Breast Cancer Advisory
Center</ORGANIZATION>, through which she provided women with information about
their options when faced with the disease.
   This year, she was scheduled to be awarded the <PERSON>James Ewing</PERSON> award
from the Society of Surgical Oncology for the outstanding
contribution by a non-physician to the fight against cancer.
   Her husband, <PERSON>Harvey Kushner</PERSON>, called this ``poetic justice.'' In
<DATE>1975</DATE> the society's members had booed her off the stage after she
challenged their standard procedures.
   Kushner is survived by her husband; her sons, <ORGANIZATION>Gantt of Silver
Spring</ORGANIZATION>, Md, and <ORGANIZATION>Todd of Rockville Md.</ORGANIZATION>; a daughter, <PERSON>Lesley Kushner</PERSON>
of <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, and three brothers.

FT  28 APR 93 / Management: Stacking the odds against cancer - Health Check
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DR MICHAEL MCGANNON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EAT some cereal before you go to work; take regular apple breaks instead of
drinking coffee all day; set about making your office a smoke-free zone; and
convince your company to offer cantaloup and broccoli in the restaurant.
All these measures should lower your chances of developing certain kinds of
cancer, and stack the odds in favour of a long retirement.
Fear may stop some people from finding out about cancer. But statistically,
the chances of dying from it are much less than of dying from heart disease.
Cancer is not a single disease; it is a whole spectrum of pathologic
processes characterised by a profound disturbance in the growth and
proliferation of a cell.
In contrast to a normal cell, whose growth and reproductive cycle proceeds
in a relatively orderly manner as dictated by genetic coding, deregulated
cancer cells dominate and replace normal cells and often spread to other
parts of the body.
More than 200 forms of cancer have been identified and can be classified
into three large groups; carcinoma (deregulation of those cells that act as
lining for organs and secrete mucus), sarcoma (cancers of connective tissue
such as muscle and bone) and liquid cancer (such as leukemias).
Lung cancer is the most preventable carcinoma. Its incidence varies from
country to country. Death rates are dropping in <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wales</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Finland</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION>, have plateaued in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Austria</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Belgium</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>, the
<LOCATION>Netherlands</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New Zealand</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Switzerland</LOCATION>, and are still rising in <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Hungary</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ireland</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION>.
The average age for developing lung cancer is 60. Once diagnosed, less than
<MONEY>30 per cent</MONEY> of patients are eligible for curative surgery, explaining in
part the dismal chances of survival, less than <MONEY>10 per cent</MONEY> five years after
diagnosis.
The vast majority of lung cancers (around 85 per cent) are due to exposure
to tobacco smoke (either active or passive), though other substances
(asbestos, pollution, heavy metals and chloromethyltethers) have strong
causative relationships with lung cancers.
If you are unable to stop smoking entirely, you might consider a less
harmful way of getting nicotine into your system (a pipe, cigar or nicotine
patch).
Colon (large intestine) carcinoma also has links to lifestyle. It is among
the top five cancers in most developed countries, but unheard of in some
African and Asian countries.
One theory is that it is related to the longer transit time of faecal
material through the intestines in developed countries. The refined
carbohydrates in highly processed foods have less cellulose (non-absorbed
plant fibre) than in fruits and vegetables. They travel slower through the
intestines which may be conducive to inactive carcinogens turning into
active ones.
Eating more fresh fruits and vegetables, or bran cereals can help prevent
colon cancer. With the help of a qualified nutritionist, also try limiting
saturated (animal) fats to less than <MONEY>25 per cent</MONEY> of your diet. If colon
cancer or polyps runs in your family, consult your doctor about when to have
preventative screenings.
Prostate cancer, another kind of carcinoma, is the most common malignant
tumour in men worldwide. The cause of this slow-growing tumour is unknown,
although there appears to be a hormonal relationship. It appears to be on
the increase even in areas where it was previously uncommon, such as east
and southeast <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION>.
Prostate cancer is frequent in <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>. Incidence and
mortality increase in Chinese and Japanese after migrating to the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>.
Prostate cancer is rare before the age of 50 but then its occurence grows
steeply with age until about 80 when it begins to fall again except in
Norwegian, French and Japanese populations.
When it comes to screening, a combination of <ORGANIZATION>Digital Rectal Exam</ORGANIZATION> and a
relatively inexpensive blood test is probably the best balance between cost,
benefit and efficacy.
