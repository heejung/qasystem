<TEXT>
<PERSON>Simon Russell Beale</PERSON>
If you want to see a play wrecked by a wrong choice of costume, go to the
<ORGANIZATION>Royal Shakespeare Company</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Edward II</ORGANIZATION>, which has arrived at The Pit from
<LOCATION>Stratford</LOCATION>. To be fair to the designers, there are a lot more faults in this
production than the wardrobe, but the clothes do set a tone. If you dress
the characters in black and white leather jackets, trousers to go with them,
and heaven knows what the Queen is wearing, you are at a disadvantage from
the start.
For a number of reasons, the production never quite recovers from this
self-inflicted wound. <PERSON>Simon Russell Beale</PERSON> is an actor of great versatility;
he is not, however, one of nature's Edward IIs. The point about the part is
that he has a strong homosexual attraction to his favourites. He is also the
<LOCATION>King of England</LOCATION> with wars to fight, civil and foreign. To carry this off, in
the court and on the stage, requires a certain style. Beale plays the role
as someone short, fat and stupid who hops about like a bloated frog.
The message may be that you do not have to be beautiful to have homosexual
passions. Yet it would help if there were a certain style. Beale is simply
gross. He never rises to the part. Moreover, he shouts - repeatedly and
unnecessarily. So do much of the rest of the cast. This is not a production
of light and shade.
<PERSON>Edward II</PERSON>, admittedly, is not <PERSON>Christopher Marlowe</PERSON>'s best play: not a patch
on Tamburlaine the Great or Dr Faustus. But it does have its moments as well
as unmistakeable affinities with <ORGANIZATION>Shakespeare</ORGANIZATION>'s Richard II. Its greatest
attraction is <PERSON>Piers Gaveston</PERSON>, the <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s first favourite. The <ORGANIZATION>RSC</ORGANIZATION>'s
<LOCATION>Gaveston</LOCATION>, played by <PERSON>Grant Thatcher</PERSON>, comes into his own only when he has been
beaten up and his mouth is covered in blood - like lipstick. By then, he has
little left to say. Before that, he is dressed in his ridiculous white
leather clothes with sequins. The only surprise is that he does not wear an
earring. That is left to the <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s next favourite, <PERSON>Spencer</PERSON>, whom we first
see under a sheet with a curate.
The nobles and the clerics are wooden. This may be deliberate. For if the
<PERSON>King</PERSON> does not behave like a king, even a deviant king, the court can hardly
be expected to behave like a court. The general entourage is more like that
of a rotary club faced with unseemly goings on, which cannot have been what
<PERSON>Marlowe</PERSON> intended. There ought also to be room for some humour, since most of
the characters go through a remarkable number of changes of mind. That is
not there either.
The best performance is by <PERSON>Ciaran Hands</PERSON> as the young <PERSON>Mortimer</PERSON>. By the time
he has become an accomplice to murder, his black jacket is decked with
phosphorescent green. For the rest, it is a pretty grim evening. The
direction is by <PERSON>Gerard Murphy</PERSON>.

<HEAD>Colorado Man Seeks Ownership Of Northern U.S.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHEYENNE, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man who claims his family was given most
of the northern <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> by the king of <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> during
colonial times has sued to get it back.
   <PERSON>Robert Brewster</PERSON>, of <LOCATION>Longmont</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Colo.</LOCATION>, said in his <ORGANIZATION>U.S. District
Court</ORGANIZATION> lawsuit, filed in <LOCATION>Cheyenne</LOCATION>, that he wants the land to set up
his own country for blue- and green-eyed people.
   <PERSON>Brewster</PERSON> claimed his family was given the land between the 40th
and 48th north latitudes from ocean to ocean. The 48th parallel is
approximately at the Canadian border and the 40th parallel
stretches approximately from <LOCATION>Eureka</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, across the <LOCATION>United
States</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION>.
   ``It is now necessary for the Brewsters to reclaim their land
before the federal government loses its ability to return the
land,'' the lawsuit said. ``The <ORGANIZATION>USA</ORGANIZATION> has lost its vision and is
collapsing every day with newspapers reporting each morning of
massive land purchases by <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> or <ORGANIZATION>OPEC</ORGANIZATION>.''
   The lawsuit filed <DATE>Monday</DATE> said <PERSON>Brewster</PERSON> is a descendant of
<PERSON>William Brewster</PERSON>, a founder of the <ORGANIZATION>Plymouth Colony</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1620</DATE> in what
is now <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION>.
   The lawsuit said <PERSON>William Brewster</PERSON> and his companions were given
the land by the <LOCATION>King of England</LOCATION> when they left that country to move
to the ``New World.''
   <PERSON>Brewster</PERSON> said he wants the land back so he can ``form an area
where only green-eyed and blue-eyed persons will be permitted.''
People with green and blue eyes are superior to those with brown
eyes, <PERSON>Brewster</PERSON> said, but will soon be extinct unless they are
protected.
   Brewster also asked the court for permission to establish a
standing army to protect the borders of his country.
   The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, as represented by the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Attorney's office
in <LOCATION>Cheyenne</LOCATION>, has 30 days to respond to <PERSON>Brewster</PERSON>'s lawsuit,
according to a woman in the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. District Court</ORGANIZATION> clerk's office. She
said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> that the case has been assigned to <PERSON>Judge Alan B.
Johnson</PERSON>, but no hearing date has been set.

FT  08 OCT 93 / Arts: The Wilton Diptych remains enigmatic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In an age which has seen blockbuster exhibitions swell to ever more
monstrous proportions, the <ORGANIZATION>National Gallery</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> has pioneered series
of modest shows which recognise how rewarding it can be to look hard and
think about a single work. For the first in a new series, Making and
Meaning, which again focuses on major works in its own collection, the
spotlight is directed towards the <PERSON>Wilton Diptych</PERSON> in the aftermath of its
recent cleaning and technical examination.
This small, portable altarpiece is one of the most refined and sumptuous
products of the late medieval world. It is also one of the most enigmatic.
Generations of scholars have debated who painted it, and why, and what it
meant to those who first saw it. The purpose of this exhibition, which is
supplemented by a small number of judicious loans of panels, manuscripts,
sculpture, metalwork and jewellery, is to offer visitors the possibility of
understanding a private and complex image. The temptation to tell them how
to interpret it is scrupulously resisted.
Although the <PERSON>Wilton Diptych</PERSON> has the inevitability of a dream, its two halves
make for a distinctly odd couple. On the barren earth of the left wing
kneels <PERSON>Richard II</PERSON> of <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>, identified as such by his personal emblems of
the white hart on his breast and the broomcods, or pods of the broom plant -
the planta genista from which the Plantagenets took their name - laced
around his neck. The three figures standing behind him - <PERSON>Edmund</PERSON>, king and
martyr, <PERSON>Edward</PERSON> the Confessor and <PERSON>John</PERSON> the <LOCATION>Baptist</LOCATION> - act as intercessors and
have been carefully chosen for their personal significance for the monarch.
The frieze of saints is remarkable for its evenly distributed verticality
while the profile portrait of the king has all the depth of a playing card.
The crowded panoply of the right wing could hardly be more different. Here
the Virgin stands cradling the <ORGANIZATION>Christ Child</ORGANIZATION> in a paradise garden, supported
by a company of angels who, wearing broomcods and white harts, seem to have
been liveried by the <ORGANIZATION>King of England</ORGANIZATION> rather than the <ORGANIZATION>Queen of Heaven</ORGANIZATION>. Arms
crossed, wings fluttering, seven of them form a backdrop to her, while four
more ring her round. This image is the epitome of a manner of painting that
was swept away by the Renaissance and the discovery of perspective, but here
too there is pictorial space.
The narrative link between the two is provided by the white banner
emblazoned by the red cross of <ORGANIZATION>Christ</ORGANIZATION>'s Resurrection which is also the
banner of <ORGANIZATION>St George</ORGANIZATION>. Its pinnacle is a silvered orb and that too alludes to
<LOCATION>England</LOCATION>. Recent cleaning has revealed that it contains a minute
representation of a green island, a white tower with two turrets, and a boat
in full sail. It is hard not to read it as 'this sceptred isle . . . and
precious stone set in the silver sea' of <ORGANIZATION>John of Gaunt</ORGANIZATION>'s speech in
<ORGANIZATION>Shakespeare</ORGANIZATION>'s Richard II.
This is no standard image of a donor being presented to the Virgin by his
patrons. Rather, it appears a carefully orchestrated expression of <PERSON>Richard</PERSON>'s
notion of the divine nature of his kingship and his hopes for salvation. As
such, the altarpiece is likely to have been made for the private devotions
of the king, a few years before his untimely death in <DATE>1399</DATE>.
The <PERSON>Wilton Diptych</PERSON> is one of the high points of the so-called <ORGANIZATION>International
Style</ORGANIZATION>, that phase of late Gothic art when painters and sculptors all over
<LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> seemed to be marching to the same drum. Such is the extent of
cross-fertilisation that no agreement has been reached about whether its
creator was English, French, Italian or Bohemian. The recent technical
examination has only confirmed that while the preparation of the ground of
the oak panels is typically Northern, the technique adopted for binding the
pigments and for the green undermodelling of the flesh tones is
characteristically Italian. The use of egg white allowed the painter to
exploit the full purity of the precious lapis lazuli which he ground to
produce the brilliant ultramarine.
Wherever he came from, the anonymous master of the <PERSON>Wilton Diptych</PERSON> was a
great painter. This is his (or her?) only surviving work. We have no idea
whether it belongs to his youth, maturity or old age. One thing is certain,
however: if it had not survived, no one would have felt the lack of it. The
picture stands as a poignant reminder of how much of our past has been lost.
That, and not just its quality, is part of its enchantment.

<LEADPARA>  In December 1940, with German bombs raining on his cities, Britain's Duke of
Windsor tried to enlist President Roosevelt to sell out his country to Hitler,
the custodian of 50-year-old interview notes said Thursday.;   The duke, who
four years earlier had abdicated as king of England to marry a divorced
American woman, is said to have made the overture to author Fulton Oursler,
who was interviewing him for Liberty magazine.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  SCHEME TO SELL OUT ENGLAND TO HITLER TOLD  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>      Oursler's notes say the plan was for Roosevelt to offer to intervene for
peace between <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>. The duke, still enormously popular in his
beleaguered nation, would immediately support the idea in terms that would
touch off a revolution in <LOCATION>Britain.</LOCATION>;   During the interview with the former
<ORGANIZATION>Edward VIII</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Oursler</PERSON> brought up speculation that Hitler might be overthrown by
Germans in the wake of Italian defeats in <LOCATION>Greece.</LOCATION>;   <PERSON>Oursler</PERSON>'s notes say the
duke "said there was too much wishful thinking; that there would be no
revolution in <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> and it would be a tragic thing for the world if Hitler
were overthrown. Hitler, he said, was the right and logical leader of the
German people. . . . He regarded <PERSON>Hitler</PERSON> as a great man.";   When <PERSON>Oursler</PERSON> saw
<PERSON>Roosevelt</PERSON> later, the president already knew about the proposal, says <PERSON>Oursler</PERSON>'s
son, <PERSON>Fulton Oursler Jr.;   Roosevelt</PERSON> then drafted an ambiguous reply, which
evidently put an end to the overture.  </TEXT>
