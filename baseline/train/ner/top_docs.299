MANKIND POSES GRAVE THREAT TO MADAGASCAR'S UNIQUE FLORA AND FAUNA 
</P>

PERINET, Madagascar 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This island off the East African coast is to today's naturalists what the 
<LOCATION>Galapagos Islands</LOCATION> off <LOCATION>South America</LOCATION> were to <PERSON>Charles Darwin</PERSON>, a study in 
evolution. 
</P>
<P>
But the island's unique and diverse plant and animal life is under grave threat 
as man continues to torch the forest to clear the land in what one newspaper 
calls a kind of "national pyromania." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, heading off the destruction of <LOCATION>Madagascar</LOCATION>'s fragile habitat has 
become the premier goal of many international environmental groups. 
</P>
<P>
After <LOCATION>Madagascar</LOCATION> split from the African mainland more than 150 million years 
ago, its plants and animals went on their own evolutionary course. 
</P>
<P>
Some became extinct, like the pygmy hippopotamus, elephant bird and giant 
lemurs. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a tremendous explosion of different forms from very, very few 
ancestors," said <PERSON>Dr. Martin Nicoll</PERSON>, a zoologist who represents the World 
Wildlife Fund here. "<LOCATION>Madagascar</LOCATION> lets you look at the limits of adaptability. 
</P>
<P>
"You can make really nice biological comparisons. What do plants have to do, 
for example, to live in a desert?" 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>Madagascar</LOCATION>'s terrain ranges from rain forests to prairie to desert. 
</P>
<P>
Ninety percent of the plant and animal species on the 226,658-square mile 
island are found nowhere else: from the lovable lemurs to hundreds of species 
of orchids and more than 350 species of amphibians and reptiles. 
</P>
<P>
There are 29 species of lemurs, primates whose name comes from the Latin word 
for ghosts because of their largely nocturnal habits. The closest living 
descendants of the common ancestor of humans, monkeys and apes, lemurs were 
displaced by monkeys elsewhere in the world. Here they had a chance to survive 
in isolation. 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>Madagascar</LOCATION>'s equivalent of the woodpecker is a lemur called an aye-aye. It 
detects insect larvae moving in decaying trees with its sharp ears and then 
uses a skinny middle finger to reach in and pull them out. 
</P>
<P>
The largest lemur is the indri, a black-and-white creature that weighs about 15 
pounds at adulthood and can leap 20 feet from treetop to treetop. 
</P>
<P>
The indris, whose haunting calls are reminiscent of sounds emitted by great 
whales, are the main attraction for the small but growing number of tourists 
who visit this small reserve about 60 miles east of the capital of 
<LOCATION>Antananarivo</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
A short walk through a rain forest, led by a guide, inevitably turns up a 
family of the indris, staring down with their Teddy bear-like faces, bemused 
but not much interested in their visitors. 
</P>
<P>
The humans, whose slash-and-burn agricultural methods now threaten wildlife and 
the nation's watershed, are late arrivals, coming from <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Malay 
Archipelago</LOCATION> only 1,500 years ago. Fourteen species of lemurs have become 
extinct since humans arrived, and ecologists fear that others are in danger of 
joining them. 
</P>
<P>
The island's population has more than doubled since <DATE>1950</DATE>, and now exceeds 11 
million. Farmers are so desperate for land they are felling trees on 70-degree 
slopes. Four-fifths of the island's land is barren, and its forests have been 
reduced by half in the <DATE>last three decades</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
The government's agriculture department long encouraged farmers to cut trees 
and burn the stumps to clear the ground for cash crops. The savanna is burned 
to produce tender shoots for an estimated 10 million zebu cattle. 
</P>
<P>
"In the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION> and in the <LOCATION>East</LOCATION>, not far from the capital, the fires continue to 
burn," said <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Ambassador <PERSON>Patricia Gates Lynch</PERSON>. "Sometimes you see the smoke 
trapped right here in the city." 
</P>
<P>
The government and environmental organizations are working together now to 
discourage slash-and-burn land clearing, though the education process is slow. 
</P>
<P>
"It's primarily a human problem," Prime Minister <PERSON>Victor Ramahatra</PERSON> said. "We 
must teach people that the natural environment is their principal source of 
wealth." 
</P>
<P>
The government has shifted course from the policies adopted in a <DATE>1975</DATE> socialist 
revolution and now follows the advice of Western donors on economic policy. But 
a <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Embassy</ORGANIZATION> economic report says no economic reforms will work in the long 
run "without corrective action against <LOCATION>Madagascar</LOCATION>'s single greatest 
self-inflicted problem: the destruction of its environment." 
</P>
<P>
The government also has broken out of the virtual self-imposed isolation since 
President <PERSON>Didier Ratsiraka</PERSON> came to power in <DATE>1975</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Nicoll</PERSON> says the government has cooperated with environmental groups since the 
end of <DATE>1985</DATE>. "It is our No. 1 conservation priority," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A recent issue of the daily newspaper <PERSON>Midi</PERSON> said an average of 3.7 million acres 
of land was being burned each year. Midi, an independent journal, likened the 
burning to "national pyromania." 
</P>
<P>
Some peasants reportedly continue to burn the land to show their displeasure 
with the steady decline in the nation's economy since the revolution. Per 
capita income declined <PERCENT>24%</PERCENT> between <DATE>1979</DATE> and <DATE>1983</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Destructive Erosion 
</P>
<P>
The denuded hillsides are no match for heavy rains and occasional cyclones. 
Great holes are carved in the landscape by erosion. The Indian Ocean north of 
the island is red from the red clay soil washed out to sea. 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>World Bank</ORGANIZATION> is organizing an international effort to halt the degradation, 
which it estimates will cost from <MONEY>$300 million</MONEY> to <MONEY>$400 million</MONEY> over the <DATE>next 15</DATE> 
to 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
Already 11 major projects aided by Western environmental groups, universities 
and governments are under way. They include efforts to save existing reserves 
and plans to create new reserves or national parks. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Nicoll</PERSON>, whose <ORGANIZATION>WWF</ORGANIZATION> is managing projects covering 10 reserves, said efforts have 
to take into consideration the needs of the people who live nearby. 
</P>
<P>
"The people don't want to cut down the forest just because it's there," said 
<ORGANIZATION>Yale University</ORGANIZATION> anthropologist <PERSON>Eleanor Sterling</PERSON>, who is studying the aye-aye. 
"They truly need the wood for firewood or for land for agriculture. Many of 
them understand the problems in the environment and would like to do something 
to help, but they have to feed their children." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
People Accept Change 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Nicoll</PERSON> says the success of the Perinet reserve proves people can be persuaded 
to change. 
</P>
<P>
"I was there in <DATE>1985</DATE>, during my first long-term stay in <LOCATION>Madagascar</LOCATION>," he said. 
"When you'd go into the reserve you'd meet people walking along with an ax. 
Just about every day you'd hear the chop, chop of an ax. You never hear that 
now. Tourism has done that. Tourism has put that place into a sort of protected 
status. Nobody would dare go in there now with an ax." 
</P>
<P>
Western organizations are pushing tourism, which up to now only brings a few 
thousand people to the island, many of them bird watchers or naturalists.

FUTURE BLEAK FOR MADAGASCAR'S LEMURS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

TANANARIVE, Madagascar 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first rays of sunlight pierce the swatches of mist above the leafy green 
roof of <LOCATION>Madagascar</LOCATION>'s eastern rain forests. 
</P>
<P>
The cacophony of twittering birds mingles with a penetrating howling that 
appears to come from the lush treetops in the distance. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Maurice</PERSON>, the 24-year-old son of the local gamekeeper, recognizes the odd call 
immediately. "Those are the indris, the largest woolly lemurs on the island," 
he explains. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, a family of four indris answers a call from another group of the 
species about a mile and a half away. The indris, known by the natives as 
babakoto or amboanala, have the loudest call of the lemur family. 
</P>
<P>
"There are mating calls or hedging-off cries designed to show whose territory 
it is," said <PERSON>Maurice</PERSON>, who compared the lemur utterances to the jungle calls of 
Asiatic gibbons. 
</P>
<P>
The gray and black indri, with its long hind legs, short tail and doglike head, 
measures about 2 feet long and belongs to a family of prosimians found only on 
<LOCATION>Madagascar</LOCATION> and the neighboring <LOCATION>Comoro Island</LOCATION> to the northwest. 
</P>
<P>
The future for the indris looks bleak. People here are gradually destroying the 
lemurs' natural habitat by chopping down the trees on whose leaves the 
creatures feed. 
</P>
<P>
In spite of a ban, the local population is chopping down the rain forest to 
provide grazing land for their herds of Zebu African cattle. 
</P>
<P>
The percentage of <LOCATION>Madagascar</LOCATION>'s 342,000 square miles given over to the rain 
forest has declined from 72,000 square miles (<PERCENT>21%</PERCENT>) in the last century to 
41,000 square miles or <PERCENT>12%</PERCENT> now. 
</P>
<P>
As the branches vanish, so do many unique species that are only to be found on 
the island. Here <PERCENT>86%</PERCENT> of flowering plants, <PERCENT>65%</PERCENT> of birds and <PERCENT>99%</PERCENT> of reptiles are 
native to the island. 
</P>
<P>
The forefathers of the indri probably drifted from mainland <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> to the 
world's fourth-largest island on natural craft made of driftwood more than 40 
million years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The lemurs had the place largely to themselves, since only a few other mammals 
managed to make the journey. 
</P>
<P>
There are currently 30 types of woolly lemur on <LOCATION>Madagascar</LOCATION>. An estimated 12 
species are thought to have died out since human beings began settling the 
island 1,500 years ago, including two lemur species whose representatives 
weighed up to 200 pounds each. 
</P>
<P>
Survivors are the dwarf lemurs such as the mausmaki, or the bizarre-looking 
aye-aye, which uses its bony middle finger to pry insect larvae from tree bark. 
</P>
<P>
The indri remains the most impressive of the lemurs. Its bushy ears, cut-off 
tail and howling cry have earned it an important place in Madagascan folklore. 
</P>
<P>
Maurice tells the story: A young man called Koto who climbed a tree in order to 
collect honey was attacked by a swarm of bees and could not get away. 
</P>
<P>
An indri came along and carried the youngster on his back to a safe forest 
clearing. Since then, the natives have dubbed the lemurs babakoto, or father of 
<ORGANIZATION>Koto</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Frenchman <PERSON>Pierre Sonnerat</PERSON> chose the scientific name indri after discovering the 
creatures at the end of the <ORGANIZATION>18th Century</ORGANIZATION>. He was the first European to set eyes 
on them but made the mistake of christening his find after the words used by a 
local guide, meaning simply, "There he is." 
</P>
<P>
Not a great deal is known about the indri, whose feeding habits have not been 
researched by zoologists. No zoo has succeeded in keeping an indri in 
captivity. 
</P>
<P>
Eight indris were taken to the Jardin de Plantes in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> in <DATE>1939</DATE>, but all of 
them died within a month, and not even the zoo here in the Madagascan capital 
has been able to keep an Indri alive and well behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
The indri's life style still puzzles animal behaviorists, who know for sure 
only that the female of the species assumes the leading role in the family 
groups of two to eight animals. Such female dominance is seldom found among 
primates.

   Leeches, Lemurs and Very Long Names

   Antananarivo, Madagascar -- In four years of African
travels, I have seen some pretty weird things.
   In Zanzibar, I stared down at the ruins of the would-be
World's Largest Swimming Pool, which surely would have
received that distinction if it hadn't been built on a swamp.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>, at the height of the great light-bulb
shortage, I checked into the <ORGANIZATION>Dom Carlos Hotel</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Beira</LOCATION> and
was handed one 60-watt bulb. The idea, the desk clerk
demonstrated, was to move the bulb from one light fixture to
another while stumbling around the room in the dark. "Enjoy
your stay," he said.
   In <LOCATION>Malawi</LOCATION>, a group of boys waving sticks ambushed our car.
They were hawking mousekebabs: whole mice, skewered on a
stick, lightly grilled. My wife took one horrified look and
rolled up the windows as we sped off. That <DATE>December</DATE>, an
American friend in <LOCATION>Malawi</LOCATION> sent us a picture of the young
vendors with their wares. "Merry Crispmouse," he wrote.
   In <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>, you get used to weird.
   Then I went to <LOCATION>Madagascar</LOCATION>.
   On the world's fourth largest island, I saw a three-foot
long earthworm, a gigantic moth yellower than the sun, and
several species of lemurs. I met a man whose name was one
letter shorter than the entire alphabet. I sat in a traffic
jam while a funeral procession crossed the road, not to bury
someone but to raise him, turn his bones, give him a clean
shroud, show him what's new in town and put him back in the
ground. I also donated blood to a legion of rain-forest
leeches.
   Perhaps <LOCATION>Madagascar</LOCATION> is the weirdest normal country I have
visited (the "normal" qualifier eliminates <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION> under
<PERSON>Ceausescu</PERSON> and <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> under apartheid) because it broke
away from <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> some 160 million years ago and drifted out
into the Indian Ocean to become weird all on its own. Most of
the animals, insects and plants on the island are found
nowhere else in the world. Most notable are the lemurs,
primates that never evolved like the rest of us. Generally,
they are furry and cute with big eyes and long tails. But
one, the aye-aye, is hairy and ugly with big ears and long,
boney fingers: the Grim Reaper in lemur's clothing.
   The Malagasy, an exotic mix of <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>,
are an equally unusual species. They give each other
humongous names. Their lives are governed by a series of
fady, or taboos, and the mystical powers of dead relatives.
They eat more rice per capita than the Chinese. They are very
friendly.
   Our first night in <LOCATION>Madagascar</LOCATION>, my wife, <PERSON>Anne</PERSON>, and I had
just finished dinner when the wine steward offered cigars. He
opened the fine wooden box and there, amid the stogies, were
a couple of large carrots. I said I'd take a carrot if he
could show me which end to light. He shook his head and said,
"No, monsieur, zee carrots are for zee humidity." C'est la
vie.
   The next morning I interviewed one of <LOCATION>Madagascar</LOCATION>'s most
successful businessmen and possessor of the longest
unhyphenated name I have ever had the pleasure of foisting on
my editors. Charles Andriantsitohaina: 25 characters in all
(including the space), marching majestically across his
crowded business card. The last name, with 17 letters, is
just one short of the legal limit for racehorse names.
(Thoroughbred names are to be no longer than 18 characters,
including spaces, which explains why so many horses have
names that run together, like <LOCATION>Itsallgreektome</LOCATION>.) <PERSON>Mr.
Andriantsitohaina</PERSON> (pronounced Andrian-su-TWINE, or something
like that) modestly said his name was short by Malagasy
standards.
   I then became obsessed with finding a longer one, counting
letters of everyone I interviewed. While waiting 30 minutes
for a call to come through in the post office of a small
village, I feverishly checked all the pages of the phone book
for <LOCATION>Antananarivo</LOCATION>, the capital, which the locals mercifully
call Tana. There were some marvelous specimens.
Ravonitsoamaholizanany, first name Lalao.
Andrianaivoravelona, Andrianavalona. But it was while touring
the old royal palace that we found a name truly worth
mounting and hanging above the fireplace: King
Andrianampoinimerinandriantsimitoviaminandriampanjaka. His
subjects, the tour guide explained, called him plain old
Andrianampoinimerina.
   A Malagasy journalist named <PERSON>Olivier Ramahatra</PERSON>, who kept
calling me "ThurowRoger," explained that <PERSON>Andrian</PERSON> and Ra, the
two most-common prefixes, are noble salutations. Intimidating
as they may be, the names give <LOCATION>Madagascar</LOCATION> its hospitable
flavor. Strangers quickly advance to first-name footing.
Charles was <PERSON>Charles</PERSON> from the moment I first mangled
Andriantsitohaina. After a few days in <LOCATION>Tana</LOCATION> observing the
world's current No. 1 tourist attraction, the ruins of
Marxism, we headed to the rain forest in search of lemurs. On
the way, <PERSON>Anne</PERSON> studied the "Guide to <LOCATION>Madagascar</LOCATION>," a must for
tourists, to make sure we didn't violate any local fady. "In
Imerina," she read, "it is fady to hand an egg directly to
another person -- it must first be put on the ground." The
book didn't say if this meant all eggs, including scrambled
and fried. Better to stick to cereal for breakfast, we
figured, than to risk an international incident.
   The eight-hour drive south from <LOCATION>Tana</LOCATION> to the <ORGANIZATION>Ranomafana
National Forest</ORGANIZATION> is an ecological heartbreaker. Along the way,
smoke curls up from charred tree stumps, the haunting legacy
of the peasants' slash-and-burn agriculture, which has made
<LOCATION>Madagascar</LOCATION> the most eroded place on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. Just outside the
small village of <LOCATION>Ranomafana</LOCATION>, however, the smoke stops and the
road follows the descent of a spectacular waterfall. Here,
<ORGANIZATION>Duke University</ORGANIZATION> is coordinating a unique
conservation-development project that aims to save both lemur
and man from man's destruction.
   Our lemur safari began at the <ORGANIZATION>Duke</ORGANIZATION> cabin in the rain
forest. Before we set out, <PERSON>Emil</PERSON>, our Malagasy guide, told us
to tuck our pant legs into our boots as protection against
leeches. Leeches] The mere mention of the word conjured up
visions of <ORGANIZATION>Humphrey Bogart</ORGANIZATION> frantically pulling the slimy
things off his body in African Queen. But <PERSON>Emil</PERSON> quickly
reassured us: "When no rain, not many leeches." The sun was
shining. Off we went.
   About 15 minutes into our hike, the forest darkened from
the gathering clouds. A light rain began to fall, but we
continued. Then there was a clap of thunder, followed by a
downpour. Emil turned us back toward the cabin, muttering,
"When much rain, many leeches." I looked down, and there, on
one of my fingernails, was a tiny, thread-thin worm flailing
about for a piece of flesh. My first leech. I flicked it off
and alerted Anne. We stopped looking up into the trees for
lemurs and concentrated on our leech-ridden selves. We walked
and flicked, walked and flicked. Back at the cabin, we did a
Bogart. We each had a dozen leeches sucking away, mainly on
our feet and ankles, though one was working on my waist and
<PERSON>Anne</PERSON> had one on her back. (<ORGANIZATION>Emil</ORGANIZATION>, alas, was clean.) They had
penetrated our clothes through some kind of hideous osmosis.
A sharp flick of a finger is all it takes to remove them, but
the result is a rather dramatic stream of blood. When the
leeches attach themselves, they inject an anti-coagulant to
keep the blood flowing. You have to admire their ingenuity.
   We saw several species of lemurs on leech-free hikes over
the next few days. But that afternoon, we contented ourselves
with the age-old practice of primate grooming, inspecting
each other for leeches we may have missed. I imagined the
lemurs, the least-evolved primates, looking down from the
treetops at us and laughing. How weird, they must have
thought.

   RANOMAFANA, Madagascar -- It is a good morning in the rain
forest. The drizzle is light, the leeches are few and the
lemurs, bounding from tree to tree, are as happy as ever. So,
too, is their guardian, primatologist Patricia Wright, as she
returns to her cabin with two mouse lemurs, captured in small
metal boxes.
   The measuring begins. Left ear, three-quarters of an inch.
Tail, four inches. Right testicle, 0.4 inch. The littlest
lemur squirms in the palm of his inspector's hand. He is put
in a bag attached to a scale. Weight, 1 1/2 ounces.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "They're the smallest primates in the world," says <PERSON>Ms.
Wright</PERSON>, her voice full of wonder.
   No sooner are the mouse lemurs sent scampering back to the
forest than a short, thin man with a big, wide smile enters
the cabin. He is <ORGANIZATION>Nala Edouard</ORGANIZATION>, the barefoot president of
Ambatolahy, a village of 31 peasant families on the edge of
the forest. His people, along with those in other villages,
have agreed to stop cutting down the trees, which amounts to
putting a hold on their agricultural expansion, in return for
development aid -- and a school. Now he has come to collect.
Again, <PERSON>Ms. Wright</PERSON> takes out her tape-measure, this time to
outline the foundation of the school she has promised them.
   "I walk into the forest and then into politics and then
back into the forest again," laughs the primatologist, a
professor at <ORGANIZATION>Duke University</ORGANIZATION>. "It's hard to even get my
clothes straight." The day before, she showed up at a meeting
with local officials in her knee-high mud boots. "I forgot,"
she says with slight embarrassment, "to change into my
shoes."
   So it goes in the quixotic quest to strike a balance
between conservation and development, in a country that
doesn't have enough money for either.
   <LOCATION>Madagascar</LOCATION>, an achingly beautiful island off the southeast
coast of <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>, is a land of sweeping distinctions: It is at
once one of the world's richest countries and one of its
poorest. It is also the most eroded spot on earth.
   The island's wealth is in its unique biological diversity.
Scientists estimate that 150,000 of the 200,000 identified
living things on <LOCATION>Madagascar</LOCATION>, which broke off from the African
mainland 160 million years ago, are found nowhere else. This
is true of its 13 species of lemurs -- ranging from the teddy
bear-faced indri, which begins and ends each day with a wail
that sounds like someone learning to play the clarinet, to
the tiny microcebus, a furry Kewpie doll with <PERSON>Bette Davis</PERSON>
eyes. The rosy periwinkle, a plant that produces the most
effective agent in combating childhood leukemia, is a native.
So are two-thirds of the world's chameleons and most of its
orchids.
   Yet <LOCATION>Madagascar</LOCATION> is pitifully poor, ranking among the
world's 10 most impoverished countries. Its 11 million
people, most of them farmers, have an average annual income
of <MONEY>$210</MONEY>. The government, in contrast, owes its international
creditors <MONEY>$283</MONEY> per person. Women live an average of 55 years,
men 52. Of every 1,000 babies born, 122 die before their
first birthday. Still, the population grows by <PERCENT>3%</PERCENT> a year. To
keep up, the Malagasy relentlessly push back the forest to
expand rice production.
   Through generations of such slash-and-burn agriculture,
the Malagasy have in effect been committing national suicide.
Eighty percent of the island's original forest is gone. From
the air, <LOCATION>Madagascar</LOCATION> looks as if is bleeding to death; its
rivers, red with eroded topsoil, spill into the Indian Ocean.
Already, 14 species of lemurs have become extinct, along with
the legendary "elephant bird" that reportedly stood 10 feet
tall, two giant turtles, an aardvark, a pygmy hippopotamus
and an unknown number of plants. Scientists say that if the
current pace of deforestation continues, in 20 to 40 years
the Malagasy themselves will be added to the list.
   "Yes, the lemurs are important. But the major species
under threat in <LOCATION>Madagascar</LOCATION> is the Malagasy," says <PERSON>Jose
Bronfman</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>World Bank</ORGANIZATION> representative here. "Their major
source of life, the soil, is going into the sea."
   But from these barren hillsides and gaping gullies has
emerged an African rarity: Man and nature -- and their First
World surrogates, development experts and conservationists --
have become allies.
   "The environment will be saved if we reduce poverty," <PERSON>Mr.
Bronfman</PERSON>, a developmentalist, tells the conservationists.
"And poverty will be reduced if you save the environment."
   This elementary equation is the foundation of an ambitious
15-year environmental action plan drawn up by the Malagasy
government and a consortium of donor agencies from around the
world. Stamped on every page is an equally simple and
neglected principle: The Malagasy must be involved in their
own salvation.
   With the help of colleagues in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Ms. Wright</PERSON>
persuaded the Malagasy government to set aside 103,000 acres
of rain forest as the <ORGANIZATION>Ranomafana National Park</ORGANIZATION>. But, with <PERCENT>90%</PERCENT>
of the local peasants' income coming from the forest -- from
freshwater crayfish and eels, wild fruit, honey, reeds for
weaving and from jobs as timber porters for the logging
companies -- laws wouldn't be enough to keep them out.
   "Our parents and grandparents taught us where to go in the
forest to make our living," says <PERSON>Jean Rafidison</PERSON>, a
29-year-old park guide who sells nuts and beans from the
forest on the side. "If you want us to stay out of the
forest, you must teach us, little by little, how to do things
differently."
   Little by little, Prof. <PERSON>Wright</PERSON> and her team of
researchers, backed with <MONEY>$3.4 million</MONEY> from the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Agency
for International Development</ORGANIZATION>, are succeeding. Amid the
cluster of mud huts at the entrance to the park stands a
bamboo snack bar, where local peasants serve <ORGANIZATION>Coca-Cola</ORGANIZATION>. They
are learning that tourists, attracted by the forest and the
lemurs, bring money.
   While some researchers count lemurs and birds, others
count malnourished children. Some measure snails and geckos,
while others plan dams for irrigation and hydroelectricity. A
scientist from the <ORGANIZATION>Smithsonian Institution</ORGANIZATION> identifies 40,000
different insects in three weeks; a student from Duke hands
out conservation cartoons to the children.
   Up at the cabin, Prof. <PERSON>Wright</PERSON> slips into a pair of dress
loafers. It is time to visit the villagers at <LOCATION>Sahavondronona</LOCATION>.
   The elders are waiting on the hillside. They don't
understand the fuss over the lemurs -- "Don't you have them
in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>?" asks one with a toothless grin -- but they trust
the woman who is bringing them a school.
   <PERSON>Pierre Rakotomanga</PERSON>, the village leader, says his people,
all 154 of them, are looking forward to a visit from the
American experts who can teach them to raise chickens and
pigs, and to extend the life of their rice paddies.
   His people have stopped pushing back the forest, he says,
but the need for food grows. <PERSON>Philomene Ravaoarisoa</PERSON>, mother of
11 children, steps forward to demonstrate. She rolls back the
frayed sleeves of her orange sweater and picks up the loose,
wrinkled skin of her boney right arm. "I'm getting thinner,"
she says. "My family is growing but the rice is the same."
   Still, when it came to picking a top development priority,
the villagers voted for a school. "We cannot eat a school,"
jokes <PERSON>Mr. Rakotomanga</PERSON>, "but it will educate our children.
They will learn how to live with the forest."
   Prof. <PERSON>Wright</PERSON> leaves with a broad smile. "We will furnish
the school, and put up posters of lemurs," she says
excitedly, bouncing down a gravel road on her way back to the
forest. "When you see lemurs when you are five, you remember
them all your life."

<HEAD>Scientist: Long-Lost Relative of Humans and Apes Found in Remote

<TEXT>
   A field biologist who trudged through a soggy,
leech-infested forest in search of a long-lost relative of humans
and apes returned with malaria, blood poisoning and the first
photographs of an animal no scientist had ever seen alive.
   ``For a week, I couldn't move,'' <PERSON>Bernhard Meier</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Ruhr
University</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>Bochum</DATE>, <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION>, said in a telephone interview
<DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
   But he recovered, and his sighting of the hairy-eared dwarf
lemur in <LOCATION>Madagascar</LOCATION> has been described as one of the most important
rediscoveries of a mammal in the last decade.
   ``I went three times to that forest to find that animal,
although I already knew it was there,'' he said.
   An old man in a nearby village had told him about it.
   To get to the forest, near <LOCATION>Mananara</LOCATION> in northern <LOCATION>Madagascar</LOCATION>, an
island country off the east coast of <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>, ``you need to hike
three days, long and strong,'' <PERSON>Meier</PERSON> said. ``Nothing is dry after a
few kilometers because you need to cross many big rivers and
creeks'' containing leeches.
   ``The leeches are not dangerous. Most people say, `Oh, leeches,
I don't want these plum-sized, ugly, satisfied leeches on me.' ...
But the mosquitoes are dangerous. They transmit malaria.''
   Five preserved specimens, the first collected 115 years ago, are
held in museums. But until <PERSON>Meier</PERSON>'s discovery, researchers had no
idea whether the creature still existed.
   The first complete description of the animal, known to
scientists as Allocebus trichotis, will be published shortly in
<LOCATION>Folia Primatologica</LOCATION>, a scientific journal. Meier made the discovery
<DATE>last April</DATE>, but it is only now being reported.
   The rediscovery of the lemur (pronounced LEE-mur) is important
because it is the only surviving species of an entire genus of
lemurs that have disappeared, said <PERSON>Russell Mittermeier</PERSON>, president
of <ORGANIZATION>Conservation International</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION>, and a primate
specialist.
   ``If you lose a species, there are close relatives around,'' he
said. ``If you lose a genus, that's worse.'' The discovery of the
hairy-eared dwarf lemur is ``one of the two most important
rediscoveries of mammals in a decade,'' <PERSON>Mittermeier</PERSON> said.
   The other was the rediscovery of the soft-spined porcupine in
<LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> in <DATE>1986</DATE>, he said.
   The lemur is brown and shaped like a mouse, with a body 5 inches
long and a 7-inch, furry tail. It weighs no more than 3{ ounces.
   ``Allocebus is the smallest primate species in existence, except
during the dry season when the mouse lemur is not fat and is
smaller,'' <PERSON>Meier</PERSON> said.
   The lemurs of <LOCATION>Madagascar</LOCATION> are scientifically important because
they are a group of primates that evolved in isolation during the
millions of years that the other primates _ monkeys, apes and
humans _ were evolving elsewhere.
   ``In effect, <LOCATION>Madagascar</LOCATION> is a giant experiment in alternative
evolution,'' the New Scientist, an English journal, has said.
   <PERSON>Meier</PERSON> has an enviable record as a lemur hunter. Within the last
few years he discovered and described a lemur new to science, the
golden bamboo lemur, in collaboration with <PERSON>Patricia Wright</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Duke
University</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION>. He also rediscovered the greater
bamboo lemur, which biologists feared had become extinct.
   Meier emphasized that the importance of the discovery also lies
in the attention it focuses on preserving the forest where the
lemur dwells. About 57,000 acres of the forest have been designated
as a biosphere reserve by the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations Educational</ORGANIZATION>,
Scientific and <ORGANIZATION>Cultural Organization</ORGANIZATION>.
   That part of the forest is protected, but a surrounding area of
forest about 10 times that size is under increasing pressure from a
burgeoning local population, <PERSON>Meier</PERSON> said.
   ``It is one of the last patches of virgin, lowland rain forest,
with huge trees you can't imagine, 50 meters (about 160 feet)
tall,'' <PERSON>Meier</PERSON> said. ``This forest is a very special ecosystem and
can't be substituted by importation of other things.''

<TEXT>
<P>
<LOCATION>Madagascar</LOCATION> is burning. 
</P>
<P>
The evidence is everywhere: in the haze of smoke that drapes itself into the 
steep dales of the capital, <LOCATION>Antananarivo</LOCATION>, in the evening; in acres of hillside 
blackened with fire that line the road on the three-hour drive from there to 
this forest glen near the east coast, leaving nothing but a stubble of tree 
stumps. 
</P>
<P>
It is visible in the appearance from the air of the great island's central 
highlands, its once-deep forests burned away, leaving only a threadbare 
coverlet of green, as thin as the felt of an old billiard table, through which 
the rich red of <LOCATION>Madagascar</LOCATION>'s soil bleeds. 
</P>
<P>
Blessed with a bounty of plant and animal life almost unique on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, thanks 
to 165 million years of geographical isolation from the African mainland, 
<LOCATION>Madagascar</LOCATION> is cursed with a human population of pyromaniacs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Centuries-Old Habit 
</P>
<P>
The result of their fires is that this fourth-largest island in the world is 
also the most heavily eroded. Compounded by a population explosion, the 
residents' centuries-old habit of slash-and-burn agriculture today menaces the 
island's future. 
</P>
<P>
The story is told here of a visiting Soviet cosmonaut who told his hosts that 
their island is the only land mass he could never fail to identify from space. 
It is always surrounded by a halo of bright red sea, he explained, the color of 
the soil relentlessly scrubbed off its denuded surface by the wind and rain. 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>Madagascar</LOCATION>'s prized lemurs, the squirrel-tailed, dog-muzzled, monkey-like 
primates of which 23 species are unique to the island, have been pushed out of 
their accustomed habitats into progressively smaller strips of forest. 
</P>
<P>
Its precious rice fields, which feed the world's heaviest per capita consumers 
of rice, are fouled by soil eroded off the bare hills. Its best west coast port 
is all but useless today, so full is it of silt carried off the hills by its 
river. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Spreading Malnutrition 
</P>
<P>
As the forests dwindle and the soil is degraded, charcoal and rice alike become 
more expensive, and malnutrition spreads among <LOCATION>Madagascar</LOCATION>'s children. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Martin Nicoll</PERSON>, a World Wildlife Fund official here, observed: "Virtually 
everyone in <LOCATION>Madagascar</LOCATION> is dependent on an endangered ecosystem." 
</P>
<P>
That ecosystem is one of the world's wonders. The island may not have lions, 
elephants or giraffes, but not one of its more than 400 species of primates, 
rodents, carnivores and insects is seen anywhere else on the globe. About <PERCENT>95%</PERCENT> 
of its reptile species and <PERCENT>46%</PERCENT> of its birds are also unique. 
</P>
<P>
Its outstanding diversity and sheer strangeness often have naturalists talking 
of <LOCATION>Madagascar</LOCATION> as if it were the product of a fabulist's imagination. 
</P>
<P>
"Butterflies as big as birds, and birds as colorful as the rainbow" were among 
the wonders listed by British environmentalists <PERSON>Gerald</PERSON> and <PERSON>Lee Durrell</PERSON> in their 
keynote address to a <DATE>1985</DATE> scientific conference marking the start of worldwide 
concern over the island's environment. 
</P>
<P>
Mammals here have retained traits that their mainland cousins lost in 
prehistoric times, such as the ultrasonic alarms and signals that tenrecs -- 
small, burrowing insectivores -- produce by vibrating their quills. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unusual Ecological Niches 
</P>
<P>
Others have filled ecological niches left vacant by the vagaries of evolution. 
For instance, the nocturnal aye-aye, perhaps the strangest of <LOCATION>Madagascar</LOCATION>'s 
lemurs, fills the role of the rest of the world's woodpeckers by digging under 
tree bark for grubs with its spindly, "E.T"-like middle finger. 
</P>
<P>
But the Malagasy love affair with fire is increasingly at odds with this 
otherworldly population of animals and plants. 
</P>
<P>
The Malagasy burn for many reasons. They burn the hillsides to clear land for a 
form of rice culture known as tavy. They burn the flatlands to bring up new 
shoots of grass for their cattle to graze. They burn irreplaceable forest to 
make charcoal. 
</P>
<P>
"And sometimes," said <PERSON>Voara Randriamasolo</PERSON>, director of the national zoo in 
<LOCATION>Antananarivo</LOCATION>, "when they're unhappy with the government, they burn." 
</P>
<P>
The fires set in pastureland eat away at the edges of the rain forest, drying 
them up until they flake away like the pages of a yellowing book. "The fires 
get out of hand because the people set them and let them burn until they just 
die out," said <PERSON>Sheila O'Connor</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Cambridge University</ORGANIZATION> biologist working in the 
south of the country. 
</P>
<P>
Unprotected by forest, the rolling hills of the highlands are scarred by 
crescent-shaped earthslides and eroded gullies, so common that the Malagasy 
have a word for them in their quasi-Polynesian language: lavaka. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Conservation Effort 
</P>
<P>
Yet for all that, <LOCATION>Madagascar</LOCATION> has today become the focus of one of the world's 
most ambitious conservation programs. Development agencies, including the <ORGANIZATION>U.N. 
Development Program</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Agency for International Development</ORGANIZATION>, have 
over the last three years made the environment their prime focus. 
</P>
<P>
In the same period, the government has awakened to the threat. After an 
international conference in <DATE>1985</DATE>, the government approved a program to improve 
management of its 22 preserves and to add 14 sites to protect such delicate 
ecosystems as coral reefs and mangrove swamps. 
</P>
<P>
"Today, there's often no staff in some preserves, or sometimes one nominal 
guide, with no transport, no training," said <PERSON>Nicoll</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
With foreign help, the government is prepared to spend as much as <MONEY>$200,000</MONEY> per 
year to train and equip wardens for each of 14 particularly important reserves 
selected for intensive management. The programs will include rural development 
schemes aimed at providing local farmers with alternatives to the ancient 
destructive practices. 
</P>
<P>
In some ways, <LOCATION>Madagascar</LOCATION> is a test of environmental preservation programs in 
the Third World. Where environmentalism is no luxury, such programs must have 
their own justification. Farmers cannot simply be instructed not to burn; they 
must be told how to find alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Why Should We Stop?' 
</P>
<P>
"The difficulty," said <PERSON>Randriamasolo</PERSON>, "is the chiefs say, 'We've been burning 
for 100 years. . . . Why should we stop now?' " 
</P>
<P>
Complicating the process here has been a history of political, not just 
geographical, isolation. For 10 years beginning in <DATE>1975</DATE>, the Malagasy 
government barred all foreign researchers from the island. When they were 
permitted to return, the government itself was just beginning to realize the 
seriousness of the decline. 
</P>
<P>
Even today, some Malagasy, just like many other <LOCATION>Africans</LOCATION>, bristle at the 
suggestion that foreign help is crucial to preservation of the island's 
ecosystem. 
</P>
<P>
"It must be the Malagasy themselves who take matters in hand," said <PERSON>Bartholom 
Voahita</PERSON>, chairman of the World Wildlife Fund's local office. "The British or 
Americans wouldn't allow their patrimony to be taken over by Tanzanians, would 
they? So, why should we let ours be taken over by them?" 
</P>
<P>
Yet, the pace of destruction is so great, and the rate of discovery so slow, 
that scientists are convinced that countless species are going extinct without 
ever having been known. 
</P>
<P>
"Since the arrival of man on the island (1,500 years ago), two species of 
tortoise, three of birds and 11 of lemurs have disappeared," the <PERSON>Durrells</PERSON> told 
the <DATE>1985</DATE> conference. At least 238 others are endangered. 
</P>
<P>
"I think you'd have to conclude that there have been extinctions here in the 
<DATE>last 20 years</DATE>," said <PERSON>George Schatz</PERSON>, a botanist from the <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION> Botanical 
Gardens in <LOCATION>St. Louis</LOCATION> who has been helping the government chart a proposed 
reserve. "Sometimes a species is localized to just the side of a hill. When the 
hill goes, the species goes." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, new species are constantly being discovered in the island's 
newly explored areas. 
</P>
<P>
Not too long ago, botanists discovered a new palm -- not just a new species, 
but a new genus. It wasn't that the palm was so inconspicuous that no one 
noticed it before. Rather, it is a majestic tree, 100 feet high and crowned 
with a red crest that proclaims its presence from half a mile away. 
</P>
<P>
"It was in a place where people had never gotten to," said <PERSON>Schatz</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
"I know that one of every 20 plants I collect here is probably a new species," 
he added. "In my preserve, there might be 500 new species altogether." 
</P>
<P>
The decline of <LOCATION>Madagascar</LOCATION>'s ecosystem began, if at a leisurely pace, with man's 
arrival from the <LOCATION>South Pacific</LOCATION> about 1,500 years ago. At that time, much of the 
island was covered with virgin rain forest. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the forest has receded to a thin strip along the island's eastern 
coast and clumps in the isolated northern and southern tips, and the Malagasy 
have perfected their slash-and-burn methods of cultivation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Population Explosion 
</P>
<P>
Destructive as they are, the impact of these techniques was limited when 
<LOCATION>Madagascar</LOCATION> was relatively thinly populated and the land plentiful. But in the 
<DATE>last 20 years</DATE>, the population has nearly doubled, to about 11 million from 6.2 
million in <DATE>1966</DATE>. The pace of destruction has grown proportionately. 
</P>
<P>
"The farmers might get 400 to 500 kilograms of rice per hectare the first year 
(of slash-and-burn cultivation)," said the World Wildlife Fund's <PERSON>Nicoll</PERSON>. "The 
second year, they only get half as much. The third year, they get a tremendous 
infestation of pests and weeds because the soil is dying. So, it's abandoned. 
They pull out and leave it fallow for 11 to 15 years." 
</P>
<P>
That's long enough for the land to recover. But the population explosion has 
forced the Malagasy to telescope this cycle. 
</P>
<P>
"There is so little land now that the cycle is three to five years," said 
<PERSON>Nicoll</PERSON>. "That's not enough time for anything but grass and bamboo, so the cycle 
spirals downhill. They go into more difficult areas -- steeper hills, poorer 
climates." The destruction builds geometrically. 
</P>
<P>
Conservationists say the government's emphasis on preservation has borne some 
fruit in recent times, particularly by halting the commercial exploitation of 
endangered forest land for timber and by controlling the poaching of lemurs. 
</P>
<P>
Some local people have discovered that conservation pays more directly, too, in 
guide fees and jobs in tourist lodges. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps one of the greater successes is a small reserve known as Perinet, about 
50 miles east of the capital and just outside the railroad stop of Andasibe. 
Tree cutting and lemur hunting have all but ceased in the reserve, said <PERSON>Maurice 
Bedo</PERSON>, a young guide who explained that he grew up inside the forest of Perinet. 
</P>
<P>
"I spent all my childhood hours in here because I love nature," he said. Being 
a guide is so lucrative here that <PERSON>Maurice</PERSON>'s brother, <PERSON>Joseph</PERSON>, recently gave up 
on his college preparation because no job he could aspire to with a college 
education would pay more than he gets now. 
</P>
<P>
In his patched blue jogging suit, <PERSON>Maurice</PERSON> leads a troop of researchers deep 
into the woods. Tree roots interlock in a sort of ladder up the steep 
hillsides. He stops frequently to point out the peculiar characteristics of the 
plants lining the path. This one is an anodyne for a scorpion bite, he 
explains, showing how one crumples the leaf and rubs the moisture on the skin. 
</P>
<P>
Perinet is dedicated to the preservation of <LOCATION>Madagascar</LOCATION>'s largest lemur, the 
indri, a tailless brown-and-white teddy bear of a primate. 
</P>
<P>
The indri's most appreciated feature is its call. "A Callas among the lemurs," 
is the description of one naturalist, "who composes and performs its own 
operas." 
</P>
<P>
Presently, <PERSON>Maurice</PERSON>'s brother, <PERSON>Joseph</PERSON>, emerges from a thicket with the news he 
has tracked down an indri family of five. Suddenly, they are spotted flinging 
themselves, limbs outstretched, across the wedge of sunlight coming through the 
treetops. Two can be seen folded together in the crook of a tree. 
</P>
<P>
Silence. 
</P>
<P>
Then with the abruptness of a foghorn comes a symphony of pentatonic sound, a 
song of greeting, alarm or awakening in five harmonizing pitches. The calls 
continue for perhaps five minutes. Then they end as suddenly as they began. 
</P>
<P>
All over <PERSON>Madagasgar</PERSON>, the Malagasy and foreign visitors alike have been 
discovering those hitherto-hidden qualities of the island's wildlife. But 
resistance to changing the old ways still thrives. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Cambridge University</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>O'Connor</PERSON> was confronted by resistance just last year, 
after she and some colleagues emerged in their Land Rover from the depths of a 
forest preserve they were helping to chart. 
</P>
<P>
"We came across a huge plot on fire," she recalled. "Later, one of the 
villagers told us they had done it to display annoyance at our not having made 
contact with them before going into the forest. It may or may not have been 
true, but they never did cultivate it."

<HEAD>Debt-for-Nature Swap To Help Save Lemurs And Forests of Madagascar</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A novel deal called a debt-for-nature swap will
pay for a <MONEY>$5 million</MONEY> conservation program in <LOCATION>Madagascar</LOCATION>, where
destruction of exotic forests threatens wildlife found nowhere else.
   Among the forests' inhabitants are 43 varieties of lemurs,
tree-dwelling human relatives that live only on <LOCATION>Madagascar</LOCATION>, an
island off the southeast coast of <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>.
   <PERCENT>Eighty percent</PERCENT> of their habitat has been wiped out.
   <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>D.C.-based Conservation International</ORGANIZATION>, which
negotiated the debt swap, has pledged to pay off <MONEY>$5 million</MONEY> of
<LOCATION>Madagascar</LOCATION>'s debt to commercial banks, said spokesman <PERSON>Roderic Mast</PERSON>.
   ``We consider <LOCATION>Madagascar</LOCATION> to be one of the highest conservation
priorities in the world,'' <PERSON>Mast</PERSON> said <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   A first-ever combination of debt reduction and trade credits
will enable the environmental group to get better than double value
for the cash it pays.
   <LOCATION>Madagascar</LOCATION>'s end of the bargain is to begin a five-year
conservation and protection program staffed by its own people under
the direction of <ORGANIZATION>Conservation International</ORGANIZATION>.
   Madagascar is an island about <PERCENT>40 percent</PERCENT> larger than <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>.
It contains some of the world's most threatened wild habitat.
   <PERCENT>Eighty percent</PERCENT> of <LOCATION>Madagascar</LOCATION>'s forests have been lost to
encroachment by poor farmers struggling to eke out a living. The
remaining forest contains 150,000 to 200,000 species of plants and
animals. About three-quarters are found only in <LOCATION>Madagascar</LOCATION>.
   Last year, the World Wildlife Fund negotiated a <MONEY>$3 million</MONEY>
debt-for-nature swap with <LOCATION>Madagascar</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>'s first such
agreement. The first debt-for-nature swap was negotiated by
<ORGANIZATION>Conservation International</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Bolivia</LOCATION> in <DATE>July 1987</DATE>.
   ``The government of <LOCATION>Madagascar</LOCATION> has shown its commitment to
saving its own wildlife,'' <PERSON>Mast</PERSON> said. ``They're taking a real
leadership role, in terms of African countries, in showing this
strong commitment to preserving their natural heritage.''
   The new agreement is unusual for two reasons. The <ORGANIZATION>United Nations
Development Program</ORGANIZATION> is considering providing much of the money, the
first time the <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> has joined in a debt-for-nature swap. And the
agreement may let <LOCATION>Madagascar</LOCATION> reduce its debts to foreign companies
as well as its commercial bank debt.
   Under the accord, foreign companies that have sold goods to
<LOCATION>Madagascar</LOCATION> and haven't been paid could be paid off in exchange for
further government commitments to conservation.
   Conservation International officials are hoping that some
companies will agree simply to forgive the debts, in effect
donating the money to the conservation effort in <LOCATION>Madagascar</LOCATION>.
   ``This is the first ever debt-for-nature swap that I'm aware of
involving trade credits as well as bank debt,'' said <PERSON>Steven Rubin</PERSON>,
<ORGANIZATION>Conservation International</ORGANIZATION>'s director of business and legal
affairs. ``We're effectively bringing private companies into the
cause of ecosystem preservation in <LOCATION>Madagascar</LOCATION>.''
   Debt-for-nature swaps have appeared only in the last few years.
The legal and financial underpinnings of the swaps are complex, but
their intent is to get conservation groups more bang for the buck.
   In this swap, for example, <ORGANIZATION>Conservation International</ORGANIZATION> will use
money it raises from the <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> or elsewhere to pay off portions of
<LOCATION>Madagascar</LOCATION>'s foreign debt and trade deficit at less than face value.
   At current rates, <MONEY>$1 million</MONEY> in debt can be paid off for about
<MONEY>$400,000</MONEY>. Banks are willing to accept less than what they are owed
so they can close the books on their loans.
   For each <MONEY>$1 million</MONEY> paid off, the government agrees to use <MONEY>$1
million</MONEY> worth of its own currency _ which banks generally won't
accept as payment _ to finance conservation.
   The result is that <MONEY>$400,000</MONEY> raised by an environmental group
results in <MONEY>$1 million</MONEY> worth of <LOCATION>Madagascar</LOCATION>'s currency spent on
conservation.

<DATELINE>FIANARANTSOA, Madagascar (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pope <PERSON>John Paul II</PERSON> celebrated an
open air Mass in an impoverished farming region today and said that
despite tough economic times the faithful should not use artificial
birth control.
   ``While it appears necessary to be aware of family planning,
couples...should use natural methods,'' the pope told the 100,000
people who gathered for the <LOCATION>Mass</LOCATION>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Roman Catholic Church</ORGANIZATION> approves only what it calls natural
family planning, or abstinence during a woman's fertile period.
   Many Western nations have pressured Third World countries to
control their population explosions, which hinder economic growth
and are a chief factor in environmental degradation.
   The pope said that although the church's teachings seem
difficult, natural methods will work and the faithful should reject
``contraceptive imperialism.''
   <PERSON>John Paul</PERSON> arrived 90 minutes late for his last Mass on this
<LOCATION>Indian Ocean</LOCATION> island. Fog had closed the airport 240 miles south of
the capital of <LOCATION>Antananarivo</LOCATION>.
   After the Mass, the pope flew back to the capital and boarded an
<ORGANIZATION>Air Madagascar Boeing</ORGANIZATION> 737 for the hour's flight to the French
island of <ORGANIZATION>Reunion</ORGANIZATION>, the second of four stops on his fifth African
tour. On <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> he travels to <LOCATION>Zambia</LOCATION> then <LOCATION>Malawi</LOCATION>.
   President <PERSON>Didier Ratsiraka</PERSON> called the pope's visit ``a source of
comfort for those who are suffering'' in this impoverished country.
   In <LOCATION>Fianarantsoa</LOCATION>, the pope blessed 100 lepers who kneeled in a
sandy field near the airport before saying Mass from a raised,
wooden altar covered by a canopy.
   The pope today spoke of the serious environmental problems
facing <LOCATION>Madagascar</LOCATION> and other developing countries and reaffirmed his
call <DATE>Sunday</DATE> for an international effort to safeguard the
environment.
   ``From the north to the south of your great island, I have been
able to admire the beauty, diverse richness of the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and its
fruit. And yet the way it is being used risks its degradation and
sterilization.''
   Saving this 225,000-square-mile island that split from the
African mainland more than 150 million years ago has become a
priority of many international environmental groups.
   Ninety percent of the island's plants and animals are found
nowhere else, including hundreds of species of orchids and 29
species of lemurs, small primates whose name derives from the Latin
word for ghost because of their nocturnal habits.
   The destructive farming methods of the island's population,
constantly seeking fresh terrain to plant rice and other crops, has
caused widespread deforestation.
   The <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> channel, off the island's west coast, is so red
from the infusion of soil washed in by erosion that it is clearly
recognizable to astronauts circling the globe.
   On <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, the pope spoke on the environmental threat to a
gathering of foreign diplomats. He said he supports international
efforts to halt the dumping of toxic wastes in poor countries and
development that endangers the world's remaining rain forests.
   Also <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, the pontiff beatified a Malagasy woman credited
with keeping the faith alive 100 years ago after the queen had
banned all Roman Catholic services. Beatification is a first step
toward possible sainthood.
   The church has been openly critical of <LOCATION>Madagascar</LOCATION>'s government.
Since a communist revolution in <DATE>1975</DATE>, the country's economy has
declined and recently, the government made policy alterations to
assure foreign aid.

<TEXT>     Welcome to 867 <ORGANIZATION>Garland Drive</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Honorary Consulate</ORGANIZATION> of the Democratic
Republic of <LOCATION>Madagascar</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Palo Alto</LOCATION>'s only consulate, otherwise known as the
home of Jean-Marie "James" de La Beaujardiere and his family.;    With only
eight native Malagasy known to be living in the <LOCATION>Bay Area</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Palo Alto</LOCATION> may seem a
strange site for such a consulate. It's here because de La Beaujardiere, a
native of <LOCATION>Madagascar</LOCATION>, lives and works in <LOCATION>Palo Alto</LOCATION>. And when the <ORGANIZATION>Madagascar
Embassy</ORGANIZATION> wanted help, he volunteered to promote his island homeland, off the
southeast coast of Africa.;    <LOCATION>Madagascar</LOCATION>, a 24-hour airplane ride from here,
is not well known in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>. De La Beaujardiere is used to that.;    "It's
true. Almost everybody has no idea where it is or what it looks like," said de
La Beaujardiere, 54, who coined the nickname "James" after consulate
officials, seeing his first name, thought he was a woman and kept seating him
between two men at official dinners.;    Since de La Beaujardiere turned his
home into a consulate seven years ago, neighbors have gotten used to having a
built-in conversation piece next door.;    "After a while, you don't even
notice it," said <PERSON>Barbara Murray</PERSON>, who lives across the street. "In fact, I
didn't know anything about <LOCATION>Madagascar</LOCATION> before it opened, and I still don't know
much now.";    De La Beaujardiere opened the consulate when relations between
the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Madagascar</LOCATION> improved after a tense eight years in the
late <DATE>1970s</DATE> when rumors, later discounted, spread that the <ORGANIZATION>CIA</ORGANIZATION> was supplying
aid to <LOCATION>Madagascar</LOCATION>'s opposition party.;    De La Beaujardiere works for free as
a consul, when he is not earning a living as a programmer at the <ORGANIZATION>Xerox Palo
Alto Research Center</ORGANIZATION>. He issues visas, provides information about tourism and
trade, lectures at schools, compiles a computer index of literature on
<LOCATION>Madagascar</LOCATION> and acts as official host for visiting Malagasy dignitaries.;   
Above all, he said, he wants people in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> to learn that "<LOCATION>Madagascar</LOCATION> is a
beautiful country with extremely unusual plants and animals found nowhere
else," a place where nature lovers would feel right at home.;    The world's
fourth-largest island, 1 1/2 times the size of <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Madagascar</LOCATION> boasts
hills, deserts and rain forests, which are being depleted by farmers who burn
down the trees to grow rice, the country's main staple.;    The largely rural
country is known for baobab trees, with their distinct rootlike branches; rich
coffee beans; lemurs, exotic primates with glowing eyes; and for the world's
largest variety of chameleons.;    <LOCATION>Madagascar</LOCATION>, which gained its independence
from <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> in <DATE>1960</DATE>, is home to 10 million people, most of whom who are
farmers or herders of either black African or Indonesian descent. It is one of
the world's poorest countries, with an average per capita income of <MONEY>$250</MONEY> a
year, de La Beaujardiere said.;    De La Beaujardiere grew up in the capital
of <LOCATION>Antananarivo</LOCATION>. One grandfather was an architect there, and designed many of
the country's elegant churches. Another grandfather started a print shop that
is still operating.;    De La Beaujardiere moved to <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> because there was
no university in <LOCATION>Madagascar</LOCATION> at the time, he said. After graduating from
college, he worked as a physicist before moving to <LOCATION>Palo Alto</LOCATION> 20 years ago with
his wife, <PERSON>Odile</PERSON>, also a physicist, and three sons.;    De La Beaujardiere
maintains that "my flesh is French, my head is American, but my heart is
Malagasy.";    And he hopes that one day, his beloved homeland won't seem
quite so mysterious to those in his new-found land.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  CONSIDER the life of the top baboon: He appears to call all the shots for his
troop; and he rules a "harem" of females. Young males can stay in the troop,
but they're not permitted to mate.;    Aha! thought the scientists studying
baboon behavior. There must be something biological, something genetic, that
dictates male dominance over females, at least among primates.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Too bad those scientists didn't study the lemurs of <LOCATION>Madagascar</LOCATION> instead,
says <PERSON>Sarah Nelson</PERSON>, chairwoman of the <ORGANIZATION>Anthropology Department</ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION>University
of Denver.</ORGANIZATION>;    Among lemurs, the females wear the pants, as is true in many
societies, says Nelson.;    <ORGANIZATION>Nelson</ORGANIZATION> currently is leading a series of discussion
groups on the topic of gender differences and how they've been perceived
through history.;    These female lemurs, <PERSON>Nelson</PERSON> said, grab food from the
males, hit them and shove them away. "I'm not putting this forward as ladylike
behavior, but it is an example of a primate where the females are dominant
over the males," she said.;    The males of a different group of lemurs in
<LOCATION>Madagascar</LOCATION> are the primary child care-givers.;    "As soon as the baby is
born, the mother gives it to a waiting male, who carries it around," <PERSON>Nelson</PERSON>
said. "It hangs onto the male's fur. When the baby gets restless and wants to
nurse, he gives it to the mother. It nurses, then she gives it right back.";  
 And perhaps it's wrong to think of those baboons as the male's harem, <PERSON>Nelson</PERSON>
said. Perhaps it's that the females do the really important work of bearing
young, and they choose to keep just one male around merely to meet their
reproductive needs.;    <ORGANIZATION>Nelson</ORGANIZATION> cites all these monkey-related anecdotes to
prove her point: Males aren't always the dominant sex.;    Among humans, "The
diminishment of women's role seems to come with warfare," <PERSON>Nelson</PERSON> said. "In
those agricultural societies that are peaceful, women seem to be at least
equal with men."  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  and <PERSON>Mark Carwardine</PERSON>; Harmony Books/Crown, 220 pp., <MONEY>$20</MONEY>; BECAUSE his
grandmother worked for the <ORGANIZATION>Royal Society</ORGANIZATION> for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals, <PERSON>Douglas Adams</PERSON>' boyhood home sheltered many "badly damaged dogs." But
<PERSON>Adams</PERSON> says he never developed an interest in animals.;    So he was baffled
when a British magazine decided to send him, a best-selling author of comic
science fiction novels, to <LOCATION>Madagascar</LOCATION> in <DATE>1985</DATE> to join zoologist <PERSON>Mark
Carwardine</PERSON> on a search for a rare and elusive lemur. This animal, the aye-aye,
made a brief appearance on a tree branch during a downpour, and <PERSON>Adams</PERSON> was
moved to join Carwardine on a second journey to find other endangered
species.;    "Last Chance to See" relates their <DATE>1988</DATE> trip to a handful of
places where some of the world's rarest animals survive, for the moment.
Alternately uplifting and depressing, the book affirms the need to preserve
other species and their habitats, and reveals what a necessary and difficult
task that is.;    Fans of <PERSON>Adams</PERSON>' "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" and
its sequels, or his <ORGANIZATION>Dirk Gently</ORGANIZATION> detective novels, will recognize the author's
wit and offbeat perspective in his first non-fiction work. There are hilarious
accounts of actually reaching the increasingly unremote spots, as <PERSON>Adams</PERSON>' sense
of intrepid adventure consistently gets dashed.;    <ORGANIZATION>Adams</ORGANIZATION> brings sensitivity
and curiosity to his encounters with the animals themselves. He also takes the
opportunity to comment and ruminate on the state of his species -- the monkeys
that mastered astounding feats of "twig technology" as they evolved.;    For
instance, while staring into the eyes of a silverback mountain gorilla in a
Zairean cloud forest, <PERSON>Adams</PERSON> ponders the futility of teaching language to apes.
"There are many members of our own species who live in and with the forest and
know it and understand it. We don't listen to them. What is there to suggest
we would listen to anything an ape could tell us?";    <PERSON>Adams</PERSON>' and <ORGANIZATION>Carwardine</ORGANIZATION>'s
quest takes them to <LOCATION>New Zealand</LOCATION> to search for the kakapo, "the world's
largest, fattest and least-able-to-fly parrot," to Komodo for its legendary
10-foot dragon ("though it doesn't actually breathe fire, it does have the
worst breath of any creature known to man"), to <LOCATION>Mauritius</LOCATION> where the extinct
dodo lived and where a host of other unique birds barely exist.;    Many of
these locales share a feature that makes them logical settings for a book on
endangered species: They are islands. Evolution assumes amazing forms on
islands, including flightless birds, giant lizards and dwarf mammoths. But
when an island's isolation is broken by exotic predators and colonizing
people, its animals and fragile habitats are quickly overrun.;    <PERSON>Adams</PERSON> and
Carwardine do see all of their selected species in the wild except one, the
baiji, a half-blind dolphin threatened by barbed fishing nets and blaring boat
propellers on <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Yangtze River</LOCATION>. But their success is incidental to the
story of how each of these animals became rare and of the sometimes
extraordinary steps being taken to save them.;    Take the kakapo, for
example. Fewer than 50 of these large, khaki parrots exist, confined to three
tiny islands. Saving the kakapo has become the top priority for the <ORGANIZATION>New
Zealand Department of Conservation.</ORGANIZATION>;    Rats, cats, dogs, ferrets and weasels
arrived with settlers and decimated kakapo eggs and chicks in their
ground-level nests. <LOCATION>New Zealand</LOCATION> remains unsafe for kakapos, and
conservationists killed feral animals on two smaller islands before turning
them into carefully guarded kakapo refuges.;    Perhaps the bird's biology
presents the biggest obstacle to its future. Female kakapos breed once every
four years and then they lay just one egg.;    Meanwhile, the male kakapo
builds a bowl-shaped stage and emits a deep, booming mating call each night
for months. The only problem is that it's difficult for the prospective mate
to locate the source of the call.;    As <PERSON>Adams</PERSON> writes, "One conservation
worker we met said he sometimes wonders if the mating call of the male didn't
actively repel the female, which is a sort of biological absurdity you
otherwise find only in discotheques.";    Although the animals are the main
characters in "Last Chance to See," <PERSON>Adams</PERSON> does not neglect the dedicated and
hopeful biologists. They include <PERSON>Don Merton</PERSON>, who deposits sweet potatoes at
former courtship sites in <LOCATION>New Zealand</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Fiordland</LOCATION> in case a kakapo or two
persist there; and <PERSON>Professor Zhou</PERSON>, the founder of a "semi-nature reserve" for
the Yangtze river dolphin.;    <PERSON>Adams</PERSON> also peppers the book with curious cameo
characters. There is the Australian venom specialist who's bored with
poisonous animals and whose only advice is "don't get bitten." There is Arab,
the scruffy free-lance kakapo tracker and his kakapo-tracking dog, Boss. Plus
hordes of obnoxious tourists and inept officials.;    One drawback is the
book's focus on conspicuous, flashy species that can easily inspire awe,
admiration and action. Obviously, <PERSON>Adams</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Carwardine</ORGANIZATION> could choose but a few
species to seek, and in his insightful epilogue, Carwardine points out, "It is
often not the big and beautiful creatures, but the ugly and less dramatic
ones, that we need most.";    "Last Chance to See" offers a poignant portrait
of some scattered patches in our shredded natural tapestry and of the people
rushing to mend what they can. (box)  </TEXT>

<TEXT>
   <PERSON>David Shepherdson</PERSON>'s job is to take the boredom out
of life for the animals at the <LOCATION>London Zoo</LOCATION>, putting something more
into their day than sleeping, eating and watching humans.
   He has piped gibbon music into the the gibbon cage.
   For the mongooses, he has provided pieces of hollow wood filled
with crickets for the animals to try to catch. ``Cricket
dispensers,'' he calls them.
   He plans a light-and-sound show for the orangutans.
   The lanky 28-year-old Englishman, whose doctoral thesis had him
tracking wild badgers by radio at night, became behavioral
enrichment officer six months ago at the <LOCATION>London Zoo</LOCATION>, the first
British zoo to have one.
   Believing a little work for the animals is healthy, too,
<PERSON>Shepherdson</PERSON> is making some species work for their dinners.
   ``Zoos should show the animal as it behaves in the wild,'' he
said. ``For example, in the wild, most species spend more than <PERCENT>50
percent</PERCENT> of their time foraging for food. ... In the zoo, they get
fed once a day.
   ``You have a choice _ either change the environment, or you
don't keep the animals properly.''
   <PERSON>Trevor Paul</PERSON>, director of research at the <ORGANIZATION>Universities Federation
for Animal Welfare</ORGANIZATION>, the independent body co-sponsoring
<PERSON>Shepherdson</PERSON>'s post, says the project also works well for people who
visit the zoo.
   ``There isn't a great deal of point in them seeing an animal
sitting in a corner behind bars,'' he said.
   He and <PERSON>Shepherdson</PERSON> say that while zoos in many countries are
making cages more natural, few have spent much time studying animal
behavior in relation to their habitats.
   The 161-year-old <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> Zoo's gibbon monkeys never did much
loafing in their tree-lined outdoor enclosure, but with the change
in their zoo habitat they've become much more feisty.
   Gibbons usually have one mate for life and assert their
territory by singing. <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> Zoo's pair weren't as musical as they
should have been until <PERSON>Shepherdson</PERSON> hung stereo speakers near their
cage and played taped gibbon duets twice a day.
   Thinking they have neighbors, the gibbons now sing, too.
   Shepherdson is also working on a computer keyboard to produce
sounds, food or even slide shows when orangutans operate it.
   <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> said an electronic organ failed to excite the apes, ``so
we'll try to get a keyboard which does more things than produce
sound.''
   Simple toys, often involving food, are best for most animals,
<PERSON>Shepherdson</PERSON> said.
   He had praise for <PERSON>Hal Markowitz</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> behavioral enrichment
pioneer who installed a machine to toss meatballs into a serval's
cage, but added that he believes more naturalistic tools should be
explored.
   Recently <PERSON>Shepherdson</PERSON> equipped the ring-tailed lemurs' cage with
poles that sway like the trees in the primates' native <LOCATION>Madagascar</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> said one of the best ways to simulate natural behavior ``is
to make an animal work for its food (and) spend normal amounts of
time foraging.''
   In the kinkajous' cage, carrots, bananas and apples hang from
the ceiling, some tantalizingly out of reach for the weasel-like
creatures.
   Before getting the snacks, the female paced for hours _ one of
the first signs of boredom, said <PERSON>Shepherdson</PERSON>, watching as she
pursued a banana just beyond nose-reach.
   ``Even tortoises pace, I'm told,'' <PERSON>Shepherdson</PERSON> added. ``It's not
a lack of space, it's what you have in that space that's
important.''
   After a cage is outfitted, zoo workers watch the animals for
hours to see how they respond.
   ``In every case so far, there's been a beneficial effect,'' said
<PERSON>Shepherdson</PERSON>. ``If every zoo in the country did these things, it
would be a great step forward in animal welfare.''

<LEADPARA>  FOR PARENTS who want their kids to save the planet instead of shooting up the
place, software publishers have finally begun to offer more environmentally
sensitive products.;    Computer literacy and environmental awareness have
come together in recent years to produce a growing body of "greenware" --
several dozen game-oriented educational titles that embody sound ecological
principles.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Even The <ORGANIZATION>Nature Company</ORGANIZATION>, a trendy retailer of eco- paraphernalia, has begun
to offer a few software titles in its catalog.;    One of the recent arrivals,
Eco-Adventures in the Rain Forest, is typical of this genre. The program
provides a computer simulation of a rain forest. It asks aspiring forest
rangers to complete a series of assignments that require exploration of the
habitat.;    For example, one assignment might be to locate and photograph a
lemur. To complete the task, the adventurer must learn the lemur's habits and
preferences. The search may be complicated by extensive clear-cutting of the
forest, unfavorable weather, the unexpected appearance of other species or
threats from poachers. Indians or anthropologists encountered along the way
might provide more information about the rain forest and its inhabitants.;   
Each assignment ends with a "press conference" back at the ranger station,
where reporters ask questions about the situation.;    Another recent arrival,
Eco-Saurus, is intended to teach conservation to kids in the early elementary
grades. An alien is stranded on a befouled island. The objective is to help
the alien repair his spaceship by finding trash that can be recycled into
essential components and by conserving sufficient water and energy.;   
Although school systems have been using personal computers as instructional
tools for more than a decade, much of the older educational software was
intended to provide drill and practice on academic material. Such programs --
clearly developed for use by captive audiences -- can seem dreadfully dull in
comparison with recent computer games.;    Developers of greenware have relied
heavily upon the game format and the techniques of arcade game developers to
produce products that are less overtly instructional.;    When <PERSON>Bob Stevens</PERSON> and
<PERSON>David Smith</PERSON> designed <DATE>Earthquest two years ago</DATE>, they tied together basic
information about the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> in a format that allowed a user to explore more
detailed material on its land, air, water, animals and people. Individual
frames, for example, showed where volcanoes were found, how they erupted and
when significant eruptions occurred.;    Earthquest seemed to be a
computerized reference book, enlivened at points by small games and quizzes
that provided incentive for exploring more of the program.;    In designing
their second product, <ORGANIZATION>Earthquest Explores Ecology</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Stevens</PERSON> and <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> made far
greater use of the game format. "Much more effort went into the fun side,"
<PERSON>Stevens</PERSON> said. Their new program functions more like a large game that
frequently requires exploration of a reference work.;    "The game has become
the principal method for stimulating interest in the information," <PERSON>Stevens</PERSON>
said.;    Another recent release, SimAnt from <ORGANIZATION>Maxis Software</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Orinda</LOCATION>,
creates an electronic ant colony. The objective of the game is for the black
ants to defeat the red ants, their competitors for food and territory. After
taking over the entire back yard, the black ants can invade the adjacent home
and drive out human inhabitants. Along the way, the black ants are decimated
by such hazards as insect predators, rainstorms, human feet, lawn mowers and
insecticides.;    To compete successfully in this brutal environment, it is
necessary to learn a good deal about ant castes, breeding and other essentials
of ant citizenship.;    "There's no reason kids can't be learning and having
fun at the same time," said <PERSON>Jeffery Silverman</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Tanager Software
Productions</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>San Leandro.</LOCATION>;    <PERSON>Silverman</PERSON>'s company recently released The
Secret Codes of C.Y.P.H.E.R. -- Operation Wildlife.;    The program puts kids
in the role of an undercover agent responsible for finding and deciphering
secret messages. To find these "cyphergrams," users must learn some basic
information about mammals and locate them in their proper habitat.;   
Developers of greenware must strike a balance between the extraordinary
variation of nature and the limitations of the personal computer. There's a
paradox in trying to represent ecosystems and illustrate environmental
phenomena through a medium that is so far removed from the natural world,
<PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> said.;    <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> had to combine elements from widely separated
parts of the world into a single generic computerized rain forest. Although
information on any single species is accurate, the result is an improbable
world where an Asian species might coexist with a South American species.;

simulating it."; ECO-SOFTWARE; Here's a sampling of environment-related

<TEXT>
   Environmentalists are mobilizing to save what is left of <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>'s once-vast <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> forest, the nation's picture-postcard front door. 

   One of the species of trees near extinction is the brazilwood, or pau-Brazil, which gave the country its name. 

   When Portuguese explorers discovered <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> in <DATE>1500</DATE>, the <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> forest covered about 170,000 square miles along a 3,000-mile coastal strip. 

   Today, with 80 million of the country's 143 million people and most of its heavy industry crowded into the coastal zone, only about <PERCENT>3%</PERCENT> of the original primary forest remains -- in scattered patches. 

   Some of the forest's rare monkeys, birds and trees, many found nowhere else in the world, face extinction. 

   "We are in the process of destroying an entire ecosystem, but there's still time to save what's left and prevent total tragedy," said <PERSON>Rodrigo Lara Mesquita</PERSON>, the chairman of a group called the <ORGANIZATION>S.O.S. Atlantic Forest Foundation</ORGANIZATION>. 

   The foundation has strong economic and political influence. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Mesquita</PERSON> is an heir of the family that for a century has controlled the influential O Estado de S. Paulo newspaper and media group. 
Others running S.O.S. include two multimillionaire industrialists, the president of the country's largest university and a retired admiral. 

   Since <DATE>1986</DATE>, the foundation has raised the equivalent of more than <MONEY>US$4 million</MONEY> for nationwide newspaper and television publicity. 
It intends to collect more, for the satellite mapping of the forest zone and for conservation programs where the remaining forest is thickest. 

   "This group is powerful and well organized," said <PERSON>Russell A. Mittermeier</PERSON>, international vice chairman of the Washington-based World Wildlife Fund and a consultant to the <LOCATION>Atlantic Forest</LOCATION> organization. 
"It's not radical, as unfortunately was the case with many well-meaning but ineffective environmental groups that sprang up in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> in the <DATE>1960s</DATE>. 
I'm very optimistic." 

   <PERSON>Mr. Mittermeier</PERSON> has been traveling to <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> since <DATE>1971</DATE>, principally to work with the <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> forest's endangered monkey species. 

   He said in an interview in <LOCATION>Rio de Janeiro</LOCATION> that <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> probably has the best chance for success of the "three highest-priority ecological problems in the world" -- the tropical South American Andes in <LOCATION>Colombia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ecuador</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Peru</LOCATION>; the African island of <LOCATION>Madagascar</LOCATION>; and the <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> forest. 

   "Here in the <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> forest, it really is possible to save the remnants," <PERSON>Mr. Mittermeier</PERSON> said. 
He mentioned specifically the muriqui, <LOCATION>South America</LOCATION>'s largest primate, of which fewer than 100 remain; the <LOCATION>Golden Lion Tamarin</LOCATION>, another endangered monkey, with about 400 left; the increasingly scarce red-tailed parrot; the rare and valuable jacaranda tree; and the almost extinct pau-Brazil. 

   "Today, with few exceptions, the only place you can still see pau-Brazil is in a botanical garden," <PERSON>Mr. Mesquita</PERSON> said. 

   Early Portuguese pioneers chopped down all the brazilwood they could find to extract dye. 
Later settlers hacked away the coastal forest to make way for sugar cane and coffee plantations and for settlements. 

   The <ORGANIZATION>S.O.S. Atlantic Forest Foundation</ORGANIZATION>'s logotype is a stylized green, yellow and blue Brazilian flag, but with part of the green ripped away. 

   A foundation poster shows a map of <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> with an outline of the <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> forest as it existed in <DATE>1500</DATE>, with the words, in Portuguese, "I Used to Be Like This." 
Then there is a map showing the scattered forest pockets left <DATE>today</DATE> and the words, "I Wound Up Like This." 

   The foundation's first specific project is to be in a still relatively untouched forest zone covering 3,500 square miles along the coasts of the southeastern states of <LOCATION>Sao Paulo</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Parana</LOCATION>. 
It intends to set up two ecological bases and buy a patrol-type boat to sound the alarm against illegal tree cutting and the banned netting of coastal fish, shrimp and oysters. 

   "Invasion of that region has long gone unpunished," S.O.S. Chairman <PERSON>Mesquita</PERSON> said. 
"But we think we can stop it. 
We're organized, we've got money, and we have access to the authorities and the media." 

   The foundation also supported lobbying efforts in <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>'s congress to place in the draft of a new constitution the legal concept of "ecological crime." 

   "We're also attempting a process of environmental education," said <PERSON>Ibsen de Gusmao Camara</PERSON>, the former admiral who now is a member of the S.O.S board. 
"A lot of Brazilians think development automatically means physical occupation. 
It's not that they purposely want to destroy the environment. 
They just don't know any better." 

   "We'll never see the <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> forest again as it once was," he added. 
"That's impossible. 
But we will put a stop to the destruction and preserve and build up the forest's 'genetic library.'"

<TEXT>
   Wildlife groups say <LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION> is
decimating its own once teeming species and those of other nations
through bear-feast tours for <LOCATION>Koreans</LOCATION>, caiman skin smuggling and the
``Polish Connection.''
   The Swiss-based World Wildlife Fund for Nature and other
environmental groups cite numerous examples of wanton destruction:
   _<LOCATION>South Koreans</LOCATION> fly to <LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION> on organized tours to feast on
bear meat, which they believe enhances vigor and strength,
according to <LOCATION>Phisit</LOCATION> na Phattlung, the Wildlife Fund's head in
<LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION>.
   _<LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION> was the major link in an operation to illegally
smuggle about 120,000 skins of South American caiman alligators to
<LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> last year.
   _<ORGANIZATION>The International Primate Protection League</ORGANIZATION> charges that Thai
traders fake permits to send white-handed gibbons and other
protected species to zoos in <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION>. Lacking funds, the Poles
obtain the animals on credit, keep about a third of them and sell
the rest to Western zoos.
   The Wildlife Fund has recently singled out <LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION> and three
other nations _ <LOCATION>Indonesia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> _ as blatant
violators of the <ORGANIZATION>Convention on International Trade</ORGANIZATION> in <ORGANIZATION>Endangered
Species of Wild Fauna</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Flora</PERSON>. <LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION> is a party to the <DATE>1975</DATE>
convention, which seeks to halt an illegal worldwide trade valued
at some <MONEY>$5 billion</MONEY> each year.
   Frequently cited as reasons for <LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION>'s poor conservation
record are its wildly capitalist economy, widespread corruption,
poverty in rural areas and inadequate wildlife legislation.
   A yawning legal loophole allows the export of even endangered
animals from other than domestic sources, Phisit notes. Thus Thai
traders obtain wild animals from nearby <LOCATION>Laos</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Burma</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Cambodia</LOCATION> or
produce fake documents to show that animals captured in <LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION>
came from these countries. This loophole facilitates smuggling
connections from <LOCATION>South America</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> and other parts
of <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION>.
   Once a tropical wonderland, <LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION> has ravaged its own forests
and their once richly varied inhabitants.
   ``Everything is for sale,'' said <PERSON>Phisit</PERSON>, who has monitored
wildlife exploitation for two decades.
   Elephants, tigers, wild cattle and deer are poached in national
parks. Rare wild orchids are plucked for unregulated export. Cobras
are slaughtered by the thousands for their skins, meat and the
purported medicinal power of their gall bladders. Eagles, hawks and
other birds of prey are sold to visiting Arab falconers.
   Stress, poor food and lack of knowledge about animal care take
their toll during and after capture. In snaring baby gibbons and
other primates, for example, the mothers are normally shot by
hunters.
   Further loss of life occurs during overseas shipment when the
animals are often drugged and smuggled in airless boxes, false
bottoms of containers and empty oil drums.
   This year only seven of 114 slow lorises _ small, large-eyed
lemurs _ survived a journey via forged export documents from
<LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>.
   ``People have been buying and selling animals for centuries,''
<PERSON>Phisit</PERSON> told a group of journalists recently. ``It's the cruelty and
loss of life along the way that we are against.''
   Phisit and other conservationists also assail what they call the
lackluster performance of Thai authorities who in turn complain of
inadequate resources and little legal power to move against the
traffickers.
   Vendors in areas frequented by foreign tourists try to sell slow
lorises sometimes drugged with paint thinner to render them
submissive, or gibbons whose teeth have been chipped to prevent
possible bites.
   A local newspaper recently interviewed a dealer who explained
how some gibbons are decapitated while still alive and their heads
preserved for sale as souvenirs at <LOCATION>Bangkok</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Weekend Market</LOCATION>, where
wildlife is frequently on display on <DATE>Saturdays</DATE> and <DATE>Sundays</DATE>.
   ``There are posters at the market asking people to telephone the
<ORGANIZATION>Wildlife Department</ORGANIZATION> if they see wildlife traded,'' <PERSON>Phisit</PERSON> said.
``But you can call until you drop dead because it's <DATE>Sunday</DATE> and
nobody works in the office.''

FT  02 JUN 93 / Business and the Environment: Swapping foreign debt for
nature - Madagascar and the WWF have developed a plan to save the island's
unique flora
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY DE BOERR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The crustacean biologist ushered the two World Bank specialists into his
office. They were there to discuss <LOCATION>Madagascar</LOCATION>'s debt. The biologist spoke,
the economists listened.
Such are the anomalies in this <LOCATION>Indian Ocean</LOCATION> island that a scientist has
become a key player in high finance. <PERSON>Paul Siegel</PERSON>, of the World Wide Fund for
Nature, is helping to reduce significantly <LOCATION>Madagascar</LOCATION>'s commercial debt -
through a series of debt-for-nature swaps.
One of the poorest countries is thus managing to counter intense pressure on
its fragile and increasingly threatened environment.
<LOCATION>Madagascar</LOCATION>, the fourth largest island in the world, is home to a host of
unique flora and fauna. About 80 per cent of its plant species are found
nowhere else on earth.
It is proving a race against time. The island's fast-growing population of
12m people needs land for agriculture and trees for fuel and construction.
Current rates of deforestation would leave forest on only the steepest
slopes by <DATE>2020</DATE>. Soil erosion is silting up rivers, over-grazing is extending
the desert and recent years of drought have further compounded problems,
particularly in the south.
The <ORGANIZATION>WWF</ORGANIZATION> has chosen to invest in debt-for-nature swaps in <LOCATION>Madagascar</LOCATION> because
of the close link between debt, poverty and environmental destruction. To
service its international debt, the country has to earn foreign exchange
through exports; such exports are largely agricultural, meaning undue
pressure on the land.
Since <DATE>1989</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>WWF</ORGANIZATION> has bought Pounds 3m worth of <LOCATION>Madagascar</LOCATION>'s commercial
debt on the secondary market, at the knock-down price of about Pounds 1.5m.
This year, the conservation organisation will buy another Pounds 2m of debt
at a similar discount. <LOCATION>Madagascar</LOCATION>'s outstanding commercial debt is estimated
at about Pounds 59m, according to the <ORGANIZATION>World Bank</ORGANIZATION>, but only half is thought
to be available for purchase on the secondary market because of the
country's good reputation for repayment.
That reputation extends to the details of the debt-for-nature swaps. The <ORGANIZATION>WWF</ORGANIZATION>
is able to sell the debt back to the Malagasy government at 100 per cent of
face value, and receives the equivalent - Pounds 3m so far  - in local
currency. Often, developing countries operating debt-for-nature swaps will
pay back only a proportion of the debt's face value, for example 75 per
cent.
In return for such good terms, the <ORGANIZATION>WWF</ORGANIZATION> agrees not to use any of the money
for imports, thus saving precious foreign exchange.
The <ORGANIZATION>WWF</ORGANIZATION> has used its debt-for-nature money to develop a new level of
conservation managers locally. Working closely with the <ORGANIZATION>Department of Water</ORGANIZATION>
and Forestry, the fund finances the recruitment, training and salaries of
'agents pour la protection de la nature', or nature protection agents. The
APNs are recruited from local communities and help promote sustainable use
of forestry resources, environmental education and conservation activities.
Small projects are also being funded. These include reforestation, or tree
nursery schemes and 'trade-offs', where village leaders protect a forest
against fire or livestock in return for a school, clinic, or irrigation dam.
The debt-for-nature project works because it benefits everyone, <PERSON>Siegel</PERSON> says.
Aid donors like it since their money goes twice as far - every Dollars 1
donation buys Dollars 2 worth of conservation. Donations to the <ORGANIZATION>WWF</ORGANIZATION> have
come from members as well as <ORGANIZATION>USAID</ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> agency for international
development.
The <ORGANIZATION>WWF</ORGANIZATION> benefits because the Malagasy central bank repays its loan in a lump
sum, which is then invested by the <ORGANIZATION>WWF</ORGANIZATION> and earns substantial interest
payments - enabling what <PERSON>Siegel</PERSON> calls 'endowment funding' of projects.
So far, interest payments alone have been large enough to finance almost all
of the <ORGANIZATION>APN</ORGANIZATION> projects, thus significantly extending its life span.
'That's crucial to the project's success,' <PERSON>Siegel</PERSON> says. 'It takes a long
time to grow a tree, and we now have a much more realistic timeframe to work
in.'
In the past, environmental projects have faltered as funds dried up after
only a few years.
The Malagasy government benefits because it not only reduces foreign debt,
but encourages reinvestment in environment and development schemes.
The success of endowment funding is encouraging other conservation groups to
follow suit in the country.
This year, <ORGANIZATION>Conservation International</ORGANIZATION> will purchase Dollars 5m worth (Pounds
3.2m) of debt to provide long-term financing for the protected area of
Zahamena in the country's north east.
The integrated conservation and development project is designed to encourage
local participation in the management of the nature reserve and surrounding
area.
<ORGANIZATION>Missouri Botanical Gardens</ORGANIZATION> is, meanwhile, arranging to buy Dollars 1.5m of
debt over a three-year period to finance research, training and
administration at Tsimbazaza Botanical Park in the nation's capital,
<LOCATION>Antananarivo</LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Holy Batroots! Are Bats Related to Humans?</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Holy Batroots! Is it really true, as some
scientists suggest, that human beings and bats might be distant
cousins who share the same primeval ancestors? Is there a Batman or
Count Dracula lurking in each of us?
   In the heat of this <DATE>summer</DATE>'s batmania, with American moviegoers
breaking box-office records to see ``Batman,'' anything seems
possible.
   The National Zoo's bat expert, <PERSON>Dr. John Seidensticker</PERSON>, says it's
an intriguing theory, one you could sink your teeth into, but he's
not sure he believes it. Other scientists at the <ORGANIZATION>Smithsonian</ORGANIZATION>
Institution scoff at the idea.
   <PERSON>Seidensticker</PERSON> says brain studies have yielded evidence that
certain kinds of large bats found in <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>South Pacific</LOCATION>
may be descendants of prehistoric primates akin to lemurs or
mouselike shrews.
   ``The theory is that these bats are really flying primates,'' he
says, and connected somehow in the evolutionary chain to the early
primate ancestors of monkeys, apes, gorillas _ and humans.
   But <PERSON>Dr. Charles Handley</PERSON>, a leading authority on bats and other
mammals at the <ORGANIZATION>Smithsonian</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>National Museum of Natural History</ORGANIZATION>,
says this theory is a ``hot potato'' of scientific controversy that
has won few adherents.
   ``We don't know what the ancestors of bats really were,''
<PERSON>Handley</PERSON> said.
   The 160 fluttering bats in the National Zoo's new Bat Cave
aren't talking.
   In fact, they don't display the slightest familial interest in
their supposed two-legged cousins who stare intently through a
glass wall into their dimly lighted hideaway of damp rocks and
hollow tree trunks.
   One recent visitor was Vice President <PERSON>Dan Quayle</PERSON> and his
children, who attended the <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> premiere of ``Batman'' at a
nearby movie theater and then joined a post-screening party for
1,200 guests in a tent outside the Bat Cave.
   <PERSON>Seidensticker</PERSON>, the zoo's associate curator of mammals,
illuminated the cave for <PERSON>Quayle</PERSON> with a flashlight. He said the vice
president was ``very interested'' in the bats and lingered for
seven minutes, much longer than the average tourist.
   <PERSON>Seidensticker</PERSON> said bats ``are not mice with wings, they are
bats,'' and people shouldn't be afraid of them.
   ``They actually are nice, fun, incredible animals,'' he says.
``They're great little guys.''
   Keeper <PERSON>Carol Prima</PERSON>, who wears a Batman baseball cap, says the
bats have never bothered her. ``They're not aggressive,'' she said.
``If anything, they're just curious.''
   They hover watchfully while she scrubs the cave walls or
delivers their meals. The bats, three species of fruit eaters,
consume 30 pounds of grapes, melons, bananas and a gruel of peach
nectar and vitamins every day.
   The rest of the time they fly back and forth, socialize in their
``harems'' and just hang out. Or, more precisely, hang down. They
also have active sex lives.
   ``They're continuously producing babies,'' <PERSON>Seidensticker</PERSON> says.
   <PERSON>Ms. Prima</PERSON> says she's never felt threatened working in the Bat
Cave.
   ``They never touch me, and they've never flown into my hair,''
she said. ``They keep their distance. They know you're there, but
they aren't interested in coming near you. They aren't accepting
you as a bat.''
   ``There's no need to fear these little guys,'' she says,
although some visitors have been seen anxiously sprinting past the
Bat Cave without a glance.
   The public's most frequently asked question, says <PERSON>Seidensticker</PERSON>,
is ``Where's the Batmobile?''

<HEAD>Wildlife Experts Draft Conservation Blueprint For the 1990s</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RAEBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Editor</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ask <PERSON>Russ Mittermeier</PERSON> about his work, and he'll
talk about marketing, the hard sell, tough choices and money _ just
what you might expect from a sales executive or investment
counselor.
   <PERSON>Mittermeier</PERSON>, however, is a wildlife biologist and vice president
for science of the World Wildlife Fund. He's talking about
marketing conservation in countries where people struggle to find
their next meal. He's deciding how to get the most from a limited
pool of conservation dollars.
   His approach is a sign of a new discipline among
conservationists as they try to sharpen the conservation blueprint
for the <DATE>1990s</DATE>.
   ``I think we've got the potential to find the resources to make
conservation work,'' he said. ``We really have to make good
conservation an element of good development.''
   Other conservationists are thinking along similar lines. In
<DATE>January</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>World Resources Institute</ORGANIZATION> issued a report titled,
``The Crucial Decade: The <DATE>1990s</DATE> and The Global Environmental
Challenge.''
   ``If efforts to save species and biological diversity are to
succeed, a more coordinated, systematic and aggressive
international effort is needed,'' the report said. ``The <DATE>1990s</DATE> will
be the crucial decade for action on these pressing concerns.''
   Without a major effort, it said, ``irreparable damage will be
done to the world's environment, and the problems will prove
increasingly intractable, expensive and dominated by crises.''
   Mittermeier is trying to save endangered animals. Saving animals
means saving habitat. The most carefully protected animals cannot
survive if they have no place to live.
   So much has been said about the loss of habitat that the mere
recitation of statistics has lost its force. Each year, about
42,000 square miles of tropical forest are lost _ almost enough to
cover the state of <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>.
   It's anybody's guess how many plant and animal species are
disappearing.
   In a report titled ``Biodiversity,'' Harvard biologist <PERSON>E.O.
Wilson</PERSON> tweaked the numbers and came up with this: Species are being
lost 1,000 to 10,000 times as fast as they were before human beings
arrived on the scene.
   ``By the <DATE>turn of the century</DATE>, much of the remaining tropical
forest is going to be in isolated parks surrounded by
development,'' said <PERSON>Mittermeier</PERSON>. ``There will be very few places
where natural evolutionary processes continue, where traditional
people continue to live traditional lifestyles.''
   <PERSON>Mittermeier</PERSON> and his colleagues have established three lines of
attack to try to limit the damage:
   _They've identified 10 ``threatened hot spots,'' small forested
regions in immediate danger. The hot spots cover two-tenths of <PERCENT>1
percent</PERCENT> of the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s surface but harbor <PERCENT>27 percent</PERCENT> of all
tropical forest plant species.
   _They've targeted 13 countries as ``megadiversity countries,''
for their unusually rich animal and plant life. These countries
contain at least <PERCENT>60 percent</PERCENT> of the world's plant and animal species.
   _And they've identified what they call major wilderness areas,
the few places still mostly undisturbed where, if steps are taken
soon, evolution can continue and traditional people can survive.
   The ``threatened hot spots'' idea came from <PERSON>Norman Myers</PERSON>, a
senior fellow at the World Wildlife Fund.
   Without emergency aid, the 10 ``hot spots'' are likely to lose
<PERCENT>90 percent</PERCENT> of their forest cover within the next decade. That would
mean losing almost <PERCENT>7 percent</PERCENT> of the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s 5 million to 30 million
plant and animal species.
   Apart from <LOCATION>Madagascar</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New Caledonia</LOCATION>, the threatened hot
spots are in <LOCATION>South American</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION>. <LOCATION>South America</LOCATION>'s are in the
<LOCATION>Choco</LOCATION> region of <LOCATION>Colombia</LOCATION>, western <LOCATION>Ecuador</LOCATION>, the uplands of western
<LOCATION>Amazonia</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> coast of <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>.
   <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION>'s are in the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION>, northern <LOCATION>Borneo</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION> and the
eastern <LOCATION>Himalayas</LOCATION>.
   Many of the species in these areas have already been lost or
will soon be lost, even if the areas are left untouched from now
on, <PERSON>Myers</PERSON> said. The rule of thumb is that for half of the species
to survive, the remaining forest must cover at least <PERCENT>10 percent</PERCENT> of
its original range.
   <PERSON>Myers</PERSON> says that is hardly ever the case.
   Mittermeier developed the concept of megadiversity countries.
``As a marketing device, it's tremendously valuable,'' he said. It
can be used in the megadiversity countries to excite the public
about conservation.
   ``It's a source of national pride,'' he said. ``It tells them,
in terms of natural resources, `we're pretty special.' It's an
effective way of selling conservation to them _ and to
foundations.''
   Because these countries contain at least <PERCENT>60 percent</PERCENT> and perhaps
even <PERCENT>80 percent</PERCENT> of the world's species, they ought to get <PERCENT>60
percent</PERCENT> or <PERCENT>70 percent</PERCENT> of conservation funds, <PERSON>Mittermeier</PERSON> has
proposed.
   The countries are <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Colombia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ecuador</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Peru</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Zaire</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Madagascar</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Indonesia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Mittermeier</PERSON>, whose research specialty is primates, said <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Zaire</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Indonesia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Madagascar</LOCATION> contain two-thirds of the world's
primate species. ``If we aren't successful in saving primate
species in these countries, we're going to lose a major portion of
the species,'' he said.
   ``We're not writing off the rest of the world. We're saying do
something in every country on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. But strategically, when we do
our planning, these countries should get a major chunk of the
interest, a major chunk of the investment.''
   There is some good news in this story: <PERSON>Mittermeier</PERSON> and company
have identified five major wilderness areas that have a good chance
of survival.
   ``These areas are not under immediate threat,'' he said. It
won't require a large investment to save them. ``You just have to
point out to the countries that this is something you should invest
in for the future,'' he said.
   They are in <LOCATION>New Guinea</LOCATION>, central <LOCATION>Zaire</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION> south of the
<LOCATION>Orinoco River</LOCATION>, parts of upper <LOCATION>Amazonia</LOCATION>, and in a region that cuts
across southern <LOCATION>Suriname</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Guyana</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>French Guiana</ORGANIZATION>.
   The other bit of good news is that the <ORGANIZATION>World Bank</ORGANIZATION>, where
<PERSON>Mittermeier</PERSON> has served as manager of a task force on biodiversity,
takes conservation seriously.
   The bank's mission traditionally has been to foster development
in poor countries, which often put it in conflict with
environmentalists. It made an important change in <DATE>1986</DATE> with the
adoption of a wildlands policy.
   ``Wildlands can often contribute significantly to economic
development,'' the bank said. ``The <ORGANIZATION>Bank</ORGANIZATION>'s policy is therefore to
seek a balance between preserving the environmental values of the
world's more important remaining wildlands and converting some of
them to more intensive, shorter term use.''
   <PERSON>Mittermeier</PERSON> said conservationists should do two things to try to
save remaining forests. The first is to expand the number and size
of protected areas. But that has its limitations.
   ``They are expensive and will compose, at best, only five to <PERCENT>10
percent</PERCENT> of the world's land area,'' <PERSON>Mittermeier</PERSON> said.
   The second tactic is to encourage profitable use of the forests
that doesn't destroy them. Researchers recently found, for example,
that harvesting latex, fruit and wood from a managed forest was
three times as profitable as cutting it down to produce pulpwood or
raise crops or cattle, <PERSON>Mittermeier</PERSON> said.
   ``Development inevitably comes back to depending on natural
resources,'' he said, ``and if you don't use natural resources
wisely, your development efforts and your global economy are
eventually going to go down the tube.''

EXPERTS MAP STRATEGY TO CONTROL DEVELOPMENT IN AMAZON RAIN FOREST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The chaotic development that is gobbling up the <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> rain forest could 
finally be reined in with a new plan developed by officials of <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> countries 
and leading scientists from around the world. 
</P>
<P>
"That's some of the most encouraging news about the <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> rain forest in 
recent years," said <PERSON>Thomas Lovejoy</PERSON>, a tropical ecologist at the <ORGANIZATION>Smithsonian</ORGANIZATION> 
Institution and an <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> specialist. 
</P>
<P>
"It contrasts markedly with a year ago, when there was nothing to read about 
conservation in the <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION>, especially in <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>, except bad news," <PERSON>Lovejoy</PERSON> 
said in a recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
Sixty percent of the <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION>, the world's largest tropical rain forest, lies in 
<LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>, but the forest also covers parts of eight surrounding countries. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Lovejoy</PERSON> was one of the organizers of an unusual workshop held in mid-January in 
<LOCATION>Manaus</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>, a sprawling city of 1 million people in the heart of the 
<LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION>. It was the center of <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>'s once-thriving rubber trade. 
</P>
<P>
The workshop, which brought together all the governments and scientists with 
interests in the rain forest, culminated with a plan to regulate development in 
up to <PERCENT>80%</PERCENT> of the <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> region. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first time that all parties concerned with the <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> had met to 
pool their knowledge and agree on conservation priorities, the meeting's 
participants said. 
</P>
<P>
The plan devised at the workshop has no legal force. But it has broad 
government support and is likely to serve as a guide for national conservation 
programs, participants said. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the areas to be preserved will be open to so-called multiple-use 
development, which preserves the forest while allowing tourism and the 
commercial exploitation of fibers, fruits and medicinal plants. 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>, struggling with a teetering economy and pressured by developers and 
peasant farmers to clear the forest for cattle ranching or farming, has been 
ambivalent about the need to conserve the <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> participated in the <LOCATION>Manaus</LOCATION> workshop, however, and the setting of 
priorities was "all done with the blessing of <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>," <PERSON>Lovejoy</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
Tropical rain forests are giant, living warehouses for thousands of plant and 
animal species. The <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> alone is home to <PERCENT>30%</PERCENT> of the world's plant and animal 
species. 
</P>
<P>
One study found that a single square yard of leaf litter taken from the deep 
shadows of the <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> floor contained 800 ants representing 50 species. 
</P>
<P>
Towering forest canopies up to 300 feet above the forest floor are home to 
countless birds and insects that live their lives without ever setting foot on 
the ground. One group of orchid species grows only near the top of the canopy; 
an entirely different collection of orchids grows at the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
At the <LOCATION>Manaus</LOCATION> meeting, more than 100 specialists met in small groups to assess 
conservation priorities. 
</P>
<P>
Insect specialists compared data on such creatures as the stinging ant that 
defends acacia trees against predators. Mammalogists took inventory of the 
<LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION>'s screeching monkeys. Ichthyologists considered such oddities as the 
fish that eats fallen fruits and nuts on the <LOCATION>Amazon River</LOCATION>'s banks when it 
overflows. Botanists, ornithologists and others did the same. 
</P>
<P>
Then they pooled their information and marked up maps of the <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION>. When they 
were done, the areas determined to be worth saving covered <PERCENT>70%</PERCENT> to <PERCENT>80%</PERCENT> of the 
<LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"The bulk of the <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> is a biological priority; there's no way of getting 
around that," said <PERSON>Russell Mittermeier</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Conservation International</ORGANIZATION> 
and an authority on endangered monkeys. 
</P>
<P>
Mittermeier emphasized, however, that the plan set realistic goals for the 
establishment of national parks and reserves, along with multiple-use areas 
where some development could occur. 
</P>
<P>
It is not realistic to build a fence around <PERCENT>70%</PERCENT> to <PERCENT>80%</PERCENT> of the <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION>, he said. 
Only the most critical areas should be placed off limits to development. 
</P>
<P>
"Ten (percent) to <PERCENT>20%</PERCENT> of the entire <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> should be in protected parks or 
preserves, ideally," he said. At present, <PERCENT>2%</PERCENT> of the <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> is protected. 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> was not alone in its support for the conservation plan. 
</P>
<P>
"The results of this meeting are a major contribution towards the work that has 
got to be done," said <PERSON>Stanley Malone</PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION>Suriname Forest Service</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>Suriname</LOCATION> was one of eight <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> countries that agreed in <DATE>1978</DATE> to develop a 
unified approach to management of the <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Malone</PERSON> said. What the officials 
lacked, however, was a guide to which areas most need protection. 
</P>
<P>
That determination has now been made, based on the number of different species 
a given area contains, and on how many of those species are unique to the area. 
</P>
<P>
"Now we'll have to see what develops from this," <PERSON>Mittermeier</PERSON> said. A new 
Brazilian president, <PERSON>Fernando Collor de Mello</PERSON>, was inaugurated this month, and 
with him comes a new Brazilian environmental policy. 
</P>
<P>
Whether the policy will include support for the <LOCATION>Manaus</LOCATION> plan is uncertain. "As 
always, everything depends on key individuals," <PERSON>Mittermeier</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm basically always optimistic," he said. "I feel sure that we can develop 
appropriate solutions, although it may take a lot of work."

<HEAD>Captive Breeding Saves Arabian Oryx, Black-Footed Ferret, Others</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   From Tahitian tree snails to Arabian antelopes,
international wildlife conservationists say they are succeeding in
saving some of the world's endangered species.
   About 200 specialists of the <ORGANIZATION>World Conservation Union's Species
Survival Commission</ORGANIZATION> met in <LOCATION>Rome</LOCATION> this week to discuss ways of
protecting animals threatened by poaching, destruction of habitat
and encroachment by man.
   The union, based in <LOCATION>Gland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Switzerland</LOCATION>, groups governments,
government agencies and non-governmental organizations such as the
<ORGANIZATION>Sierra Club</ORGANIZATION>.
   The three-day <LOCATION>Rome</LOCATION> meeting, which ended <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, examined the
well-known plight of the African elephant, whose numbers have
dropped from 1.3 million to 700,000 in the past 10 years because of
poaching.
   But the experts also discussed the prospects for saving
lesser-known species such as the <LOCATION>Mediterranean</LOCATION> monk seal, Himalayan
snow leopard, <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> panther, <LOCATION>Javan</LOCATION> rhinoceros and Liberian
mongoose.
   In many cases, the answer is breeding animals in captivity and
releasing them in the wild.
   ``It's only in the past few years that captive breeding has
become an integral part of conservation,'' said <PERSON>Ulysses S. Seal</PERSON>, a
professor at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Minnesota</ORGANIZATION> who is chairman of the
union's captive breeding group. ``We project that 1,500 animals,
birds and reptiles will need captive breeding in the next 50 years.
Right now, we have more than 125 species on our plate.''
   Those include the Arabian oryx, a large antelope that became
extinct in the wild but was saved by breeding in zoos in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Phoenix</LOCATION> and elsewhere. Wild herds now roam <LOCATION>Oman</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Jordan</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Saudi
Arabia</LOCATION>.
   ``This is the flagship example of a dramatic species saved from
extinction by captive breeding,'' <PERSON>Seal</PERSON> said in an interview.
   Another success story involves the black-footed ferret, a member
of the <LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION> weasel family. Only 17 were left in the wild in <DATE>1985</DATE>,
but captive breeding has brought the population up to 124.
   ``We predict that in two years the population will expand to more
than 500, and in <DATE>1991</DATE> we plan to start releasing them back into the
wild,'' Seal said.
   He also cited efforts to save the partula, a species of tiny tree
snails found on the Tahitian island of <LOCATION>Moorea</LOCATION>. The species was
virtually wiped out by carniverous snails imported from <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, but
the surviving partula have been taken to a dozen zoos in four
countries for breeding, <PERSON>Seal</PERSON> said.
   The next target is the <LOCATION>Javan</LOCATION> rhino. The lumbering beasts once
roamed across much of <LOCATION>Indochina</LOCATION> but today only 50 are left on the
island of <LOCATION>Java</LOCATION>. Seal said the union is working with the Indonesian
government to begin a captive breeding program next year.
   Captive breeding is not the answer for all animals, however,
especially members of the cat species.
   ``There is some captive breeding, but there are a lot of problems
in reintroducing a large predator that is captive bred,'' said <PERSON>Peter
Jackson</PERSON>, chairman of the conservation union's cat specialist group.
``For one thing, people are afraid of them. Also, a cat has to learn
how to hunt from its parents, it doesn't come naturally.''
   Nevertheless, conservationists have succeeded in saving the the
lynx, which was extinct in western <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> at the turn of the
century. More than a dozen were caught in the wild in <LOCATION>Czechoslovakia</LOCATION>
and released in the Swiss and French Alps in the early <DATE>1970s</DATE>. Sixty
to 80 lynx survive in the wild <DATE>today</DATE>, <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON> said.
   Conservation has taken a unique twist in <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>, where man-eating
tigers have killed more than 500 people in the <LOCATION>Sunderbans</LOCATION> mangove
forests of <LOCATION>West Bengal</LOCATION> since <DATE>1975</DATE>.
   It seems that tigers only attack their prey from behind. So three
years ago, wildlife officials began issuing rubber face masks for
Sunderbans workers to wear on the backs of their heads.
   Since then, no one wearing a mask has been attacked, <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON> said.
   ``Some were attacked after they had just taken off the mask for
lunch,'' he said. ``Tigers have been seen following those wearing
the masks but they have not pressed home the attack.''
   For all the attention devoted to tigers, elephants, rhinos and
others animals, it is some of the world's smaller species that are
most at risk, specialists said.
   ``People focus on the larger species that they are going to
miss,'' said <PERSON>George Rabb</PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION>Chicago Zoological Park</ORGANIZATION>
and chairman of the species survival commission. ``But for every one
of these, at least 5,000 species disappear every year, mainly small
insects living in rain forests.''
   ``You could almost bet that the most endangered species in the
world is not known to science,'' added <PERSON>Martin Holdgate</PERSON>, director
general of the union. ``It is living somewhere in the canopy of a
rain forest. One of these unknown, inconspicuous insects. No
scientist will miss it, except as a statistic.''

<TEXT>
   By now the signs are everywhere that human beings are wrecking their own planet. 
A friend who recently sailed the <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> in a small boat reports finding garbage strewn all the way across. 
Overhead, we have damaged one part of the atmosphere so that dangerous radiation can seep in and another part so that solar heat can't get out. 
On the equator, we're hacking away and burning the dense forest where most of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s plant and creature species live. 

   The litany of ravages is long and familiar. 
The underdeveloped world continues to multiply and the overdeveloped world continues to need its amenities. 
Where this is all headed is the subject of two new books. 
Both paint a predictably grim future, one with broad strokes and the other with fine. 

   <PERSON>Bill McKibben</PERSON>'s subject is "The End of Nature" (<ORGANIZATION>Random House</ORGANIZATION>, 226 pages, <MONEY>$19.95</MONEY>) itself, which he claims humans already have brought about. 
The subject is important, the notion is arresting and <PERSON>Mr. McKibben</PERSON> argues convincingly. 
But in the end he probably is preaching a familiar text to the previously converted, many of whom are readers of the New Yorker in whose pages this book was first serialized. 
<PERSON>Dale Peterson</PERSON>'s "The Deluge and the Ark" (<LOCATION>Houghton Mifflin</LOCATION>, 378 pages, <MONEY>$24.95</MONEY>) is a far richer book on a narrower subject: the plight of monkeys, gorillas and other primates as people whittle away their habitat. 
While the focus is on endangered primates, <PERSON>Mr. Peterson</PERSON> is able to involve gene pools, pharmacology, farming, lumbering, animal experimentation, nutrition and the intelligence of beavers. 
And through all of this it's clear that whatever happens to the baboons today is likely to happen to the rest of us tomorrow. 

   <PERSON>Mr. McKibben</PERSON> warns that his apocalyptic thesis is complex and subtle, but in fact it can be stated quite directly. 
Human activity, especially in the past century, has released staggering amounts of carbon dioxide and other gasses into the atmosphere. 
These gasses collect into a layer, trapping solar heat that otherwise would waft away. 
The planet already is warmer than it was 100 years ago, he says (though not all scientists agree), and this is only the beginning. 
Nature, which we have always considered to be steady and eternal, seems to be wearing down like a machine now that man sets the global thermostat. 

   <PERSON>Mr. McKibben</PERSON> gets off to a great start with an essay on our delusions about how slowly nature changes. 
We think of nature as evolving over eons that stretch eternally backward, but the perception is misleading. 
Civilization began fewer than 400 generations ago. 
It's a short hop from the present back to the <ORGANIZATION>Renaissance</ORGANIZATION>, a shorter one to the <ORGANIZATION>Industrial Revolution</ORGANIZATION>, and practically nothing to World War II and the wide use of plastic. 
The curve of change grows ever steeper. 

   <PERSON>Mr. McKibben</PERSON>'s imagery is vivid. 
For example, a car emits its own weight in carbon each year. 
And he conjectures plausibly about what only a couple more decades of warming may bring: Oceans rising to swallow coastal cities, crops dying off in the <LOCATION>Corn Belt</LOCATION>, a real-estate boom in <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>. 

   One trouble, though, is that not much of this is new. 
<PERSON>Mr. McKibben</PERSON> has done a useful job of pulling together and popularizing what others have said about global warming. 
Beyond that, he can't do much more than ruminate, and before long he just fizzles out. 
He grows repetitious, then preachy and even trivial: He says the mere thought of an altered nature has spoiled his hikes in the woods. 

   His conclusion is either bleak or weak, depending on whether you think <PERSON>Mr. McKibben</PERSON> believes his own thesis. 
If nature has irrevocably reached its end, that's pretty grim. 
So why bother to write a cautionary book about it? 
With nods to <PERSON>Rachel Carson</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jonathan Schell</PERSON>, who warned the world about DDT and nuclear war, <PERSON>Mr. McKibben</PERSON> must be hoping to rouse his readers to some kind of action. 
So maybe nature isn't really finished, he suggests. 
Maybe instead of trying to conquer nature, people will come to see themselves as part of nature. 

   <PERSON>Dale Peterson</PERSON> works similar ground in an entirely fresh way. 
"The Deluge and the Ark" is first an appreciation of primates, the intelligent and beautiful animals who are our closest relatives on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. 
The title refers to the primates' threatened demise under numerous, often needless, pressures from humanity and the many small efforts to save them. 
But the book also is a good travel adventure yarn, as <PERSON>Mr. Peterson</PERSON>, who teaches English at <ORGANIZATION>Tufts University</ORGANIZATION>, treks through Central and <LOCATION>South America</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Indonesia</LOCATION> to find and describe a representative dozen species and their fates. 
Interwoven throughout are <PERSON>Mr. Peterson</PERSON>'s constructive reflections on what he observes. 

   Early in the book <PERSON>Mr. Peterson</PERSON> enters his first tropical rain forest. 
By now most of us are at least dimly aware that these forests are important and ought to be saved, even if we aren't precisely sure why. 
<PERSON>Mr. Peterson</PERSON> tells why in detail. 
From the high canopy perhaps 160 feet overhead to the snarl of roots below, the tropical forest is an incredibly rich, diverse, complex, yet extremely fragile, reservoir of plant and animal life. 
Once the trees are cut down to create grazing lands for cattle, the soil dries up after a few years, probably never to be revived. 
Meanwhile, the rancher moves on to slash and burn another hunk of forest, further encroaching on the primates' home. 

   The irony is that tropical forests are abundant potential sources of human nutrition. 
With intelligent management, <PERSON>Mr. Peterson</PERSON> argues, the forests could provide far higher yields of other foods, even if as he concedes, they wouldn't taste like steak au poivre. (Though he doesn't mention it, an experimental program in <LOCATION>Costa Rica</LOCATION> run by the <ORGANIZATION>Green Iguana Foundation</ORGANIZATION> is showing considerable success breeding iguanas in the rain forest, letting them sit on branches until nice and chubby and ready for the pot.) 

   "The Deluge and the Ark" is almost as rich and diverse as the rain forest itself. 
While <PERSON>Mr. Peterson</PERSON> is plainly full of fury, he remains graceful, polite and even somewhat optimistic. 
He has written an important book that is also a pleasure to read.

holidays that help to improve the environment / Practical Traveller

<DATELINE>
   FOR SOME, the concept of an eco-tourist
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
someone whose globe-trottings have a positive environmental impact - is a
contradiction in terms.
Tourism, they argue, is by its nature destructive, leaving in its wake a
trail of aircraft fuel, polluted beaches, devastated fishing villages and
western habits of doubtful morality. The only true eco-traveller stays at
home.
Not so, others say. At its best, tourism promotes understanding, spreads
wealth and can contribute to the environment. For those wishing to give
eco-travel a go, here are a few ideas:
<ORGANIZATION>Earthwatch</ORGANIZATION> (tel: 0865-311-600) is a non-profit-making organisation that
matches scientists and archaeologists with volunteers keen to work on
research and conservation projects. The <ORGANIZATION>Earthwatch</ORGANIZATION> magazine, which comes six
times a year to members paying a Pounds 22 subscription, is bursting with
140 projects in 40 countries.
Members can count orang-utans in <LOCATION>Indonesia</LOCATION>, delve into volcanology in
<LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION>, observe insect behaviour in <LOCATION>Peru</LOCATION> or honey possum habits in
<LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>, translate sea lion language in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, or dig for stone tools
in <LOCATION>Ireland</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>County Kerry</LOCATION>. One project, for example, seeks to discover
whether Carpathian wolves in south-east <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION> kill the weakest or strongest
members of red deer herds. Volunteers, paying Pounds 795 for two weeks,
monitor deer and wolf populations and record the scars and antler
measurements of wolf-killed deer. Earthwatch trips, not including flights,
range from Pounds 400 to Pounds 1,500.
Discover the World (tel: 06977-48356) organises wildlife and wilderness
holidays in conjunction with the World Wide Fund for Nature and the Whale
and <ORGANIZATION>Dolphin Conservation Society</ORGANIZATION>. A significant portion of the booking fee
is donated to the conservation group concerned. Groups are kept small 'to
reduce the environmental impact' and holidays are designed to benefit local
economies.
A highlight is the chance to track pandas in a Chinese reserve at <LOCATION>Wolong</LOCATION>,
the first time UK citizens have been allowed to do so. There are also trips
to watch lemurs in <LOCATION>Madagascar</LOCATION>, polar bears in <LOCATION>Spitsbergen</LOCATION> and minke whales
off the coast of <LOCATION>Scotland</LOCATION>. Holidays start at Pounds 295 (weekend breaks)
soaring to more than Pounds 3,000 for whale watching in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>.
Cox and <PERSON>Kings</PERSON> (tel: 071-931-9106) also organises one-off wildlife tours in
conjunction with charities and puts out a brochure called <ORGANIZATION>Environmental
Journeys</ORGANIZATION>. Holidays are planned with the help of naturalists and Cox and
<ORGANIZATION>Kings</ORGANIZATION> buys an acre of rain forest in <LOCATION>Belize</LOCATION> for each booking made.
<PERSON>David Bellamy</PERSON> is guest lecturer on one tour to the <LOCATION>Solomon Islands</LOCATION>, due to
depart in <DATE>May 1993</DATE> (cost: Pounds 3,450). Defending the concept of
eco-travel, <PERSON>Bellamy</PERSON> says: 'Tourism is not going to go away, so it's got to
be brought into line. Tourism of the right sort shows people what a
wonderful place the world is, but how delicate and fragile it can be. It's a
way of winning friends for the environmental movement.'
Those who are in deadly earnest about eco-travel may consider signing up for
Nols, a US-based, non-profit-making group which teaches outdoor skills,
'low-impact wilderness living' and respect for the environment.
Nols' expeditions - to the <LOCATION>Rocky Mountains</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pacific north-west America</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION> - encourage participants to become
self-sufficient in the wilderness. The idea is to leave no trace of your
presence behind; toilet paper is banned while picnic and camp sites are
scuffed over. This is not just an adventure holiday, the brochure stresses.
'Nols is a school where pencils and notebooks are as necessary as backpacks,
ropes and tents. Our classroom is the wilderness.'
Those thinking of signing up need to be pretty fit, or be prepared to become
so. Nols caters for people from 14 to 75, though many of its customers are
of student age. However, the brochure contains a special section for those
over 25, mainly trips of two and three weeks. Expeditions start at
reasonable prices and rise to Pounds 4,000 for three months in <LOCATION>Patagonia</LOCATION>.

FT  22 MAR 94 / Survey of Jersey (16): Natural beauty is main attraction -
The locals love their island and this clearly shows in its cleanliness and

</HEADLINE>

The problem facing the visitor to <LOCATION>Jersey</LOCATION> is not what to do, but what to miss
out. The island is small enough for easy and leisurely exploring, while
surprisingly full of places of interest and activities to suit most tastes.
Undoubtedly Jersey's main attraction is its natural beauty. Packed into 45
square miles - <DATE>63</DATE> square miles at very low tide - are long sandy beaches,
cliff-bound little coves, small fishing harbours, hedgerows and fields full
of wild flowers, small farm fields with neat rows of vegetables or a few
Jersey cows, and winding country lanes shaded by trees.
Jersey is often referred to as the floral island and its climate ensures a
constant and wide variety of plant life. The locals love their island and
this clearly shows in its cleanliness and the cherished appearance of homes
and gardens. The pace is slow and people make time to talk.
Tucked away in <ORGANIZATION>St. Mary is La Mare Vineyards</ORGANIZATION>, with 5 1/2 acres of vines. The
warm granite buildings date in part back to the <DATE>1600s</DATE> and visitors can
sample produce at a wine-tasting and enjoy home-made food in the Buttery.
Wines and cider are on sale at the vineyard as well as a mouth-watering
selection of mustards and preserves, all home made. This year's addition to
the range is 'Jersey Lightning' - a potent spirit distilled from cider in a
copper pot-still, not unlike Calvados.
A different type of distilling goes on at <ORGANIZATION>Jersey Lavender Farm</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>St.
Brelade</LOCATION>. Seven acres of lavender fields are harvested to obtain essential
oil used in the farm's selection of cosmetic products. Visitors can walk
around the lavender and herb fields and watch the distilling and bottling
process.
About 55 varieties of lavender are grown here, which comprise one of the
national collections of plants approved by the <ORGANIZATION>National Council</ORGANIZATION> for the
<ORGANIZATION>Conservation of Plants and Gardens</ORGANIZATION>. A range of products are on sale and
Jersey cream teas are served in these fragrant surroundings.
Herb enthusiasts will want to visit Samares Manor in <LOCATION>St. Clement</LOCATION>. It has one
of the largest herb gardens in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>, with more than 100 varieties planted
out. Talks on herbs are given in the garden most afternoons and potted herbs
can be bought at the shop. Samares also has other well-designed gardens to
wander round, including a water garden and a Japanese garden.
Carnations are grown commercially in <LOCATION>Jersey</LOCATION> and a visit to <ORGANIZATION>Jersey Flower
Centre</ORGANIZATION> at Retreat Farm, <LOCATION>St. Lawrence</LOCATION>, will allow the visitor a view of the
whole production cycle, up to packaging and posting of mail order bunches.
This is the largest carnation-growing nursery in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> and its mail order
section, Flying Flowers, was recently listed on the stock exchange.
Animal lovers will find that Jersey Zoo is a unique centre for breeding rare
and endangered species of animals in captivity. Founded in <DATE>1963</DATE> by author
<PERSON>Gerald Durrell</PERSON>, the zoo is now home to such animals as aye-ayes, lemurs and
giant jumping rats. Visitors always enjoy the families of orang-utans and
lowland gorillas, one of which achieved world fame by his protection of a
young visitor who fell into the enclosure.
Visitors interested in the island's history do best to start at the
award-winning <ORGANIZATION>Jersey Museum</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>St. Helier</LOCATION>. The museum's audio-visual
presentation and exhibitions act as a gateway to further explorations. There
are sites, monuments and castles to visit dating from prehistoric time
through to modern history.
The German occupation of <LOCATION>Jersey</LOCATION> during the last war is well illustrated at
several sites, but probably most prominently at the <ORGANIZATION>German Underground
Hospital</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>St. Lawrence</LOCATION>. Regarded as the most ambitious engineering feat of
the occupation, it now vividly brings to life the experiences of thousands
of islanders at that time.
Jersey offers a wide choice of accommodation and the authorities ensure
standards are kept up. Prices per night range from Pounds 13 for
accommodation only in a small guest-house, to Pounds 300 for a suite in a
five-sun (the <LOCATION>Jersey</LOCATION> official rating) hotel.
For visitors wanting to be in <LOCATION>St. Helier</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Pomme d'Or</ORGANIZATION> on the waterfront
offers excellent three-sun facilities - 147 bedrooms, two restaurants, a
coffee shop, a pub and easy access to both harbour and town centre.
Longueville Manor, just outside <LOCATION>St. Helier</LOCATION>, is the island's only five-sun
hotel, named <PERSON>Egon Ronay</PERSON> hotel of the year in <DATE>1991</DATE>. Prices for a room per
night range from Pounds 110 for a single to Pounds 300 for a suite.
Country lovers will appreciate the four-sun Chateau La Chaire in the <LOCATION>Rozel
Valley</LOCATION>. Oak panelling, antique furniture, more than eight acres of grounds
and a cuisine renowned throughout the island combine to give the guest an
experience not dissimilar to that of staying in a really comfortable country
house. Prices range from about Pounds 50 to <LOCATION>Pounds</LOCATION> <TIME>180 per night</TIME>, depending
on accommodation and time of year.
The standard of cuisine generally throughout the island is high, with
seafood a speciality in many restaurants. A favourite with both visitors and
locals is the Dolphin (also a two-sun hotel) on the edge of the little
fishing harbour of <PERSON>Gorey</PERSON>, beneath the dramatic <ORGANIZATION>Mont Orgueil Castle</ORGANIZATION>. From
about Pounds 20 per head for a full meal, the delights of Jersey seafood can
be enjoyed in very appropriate surroundings.

FT  20 MAR 92 / Technology: Tamarins return to the jungle - A Brazilian
experiment to save an endangered species from extinction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In a lush patch of Brazilian rainforest a group of golden lion tamarins
discover the joys of swinging between trees. Brought up in the <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>
zoo and recently introduced to the wild, they form part of one of the
world's most successful experiments in saving a species from extinction.
The project brings together first and third world nations, private and
public sectors, environmentalists and farmers, as well as several scientific
disciplines. Its techniques are now being copied worldwide.
Only 450 of the monkeys survive in the wild. Throughout this century many
have been captured to keep as domestic pets by people attracted by their
exotic beauty and flaming golden fur. Moreover, their natural habitat has
almost disappeared.
The animal has been rescued through the combined forces of <PERSON>Aldemar Coimbra</PERSON>,
<LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>'s first primate specialist, and <PERSON>Devra Kleiman</PERSON>, a director of the
<ORGANIZATION>National Zoo</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>.
Coimbra realised the danger in the <DATE>1960s</DATE> when there were around 600 left. He
was unable to raise much interest until <DATE>1972</DATE> when <PERSON>Kleiman</PERSON> held a conference
in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> on Saving the <LOCATION>Golden Lion Tamarin</LOCATION>. Experts from <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> and the
<LOCATION>US</LOCATION> discussed how tamarins could be reproduced in captivity and then
reintroduced to their native habitat.
Breeding tamarins in zoos proved so successful that there are now more in
captivity than in the wild. 'When I started there were just 72 animals in 16
zoos. Now we have more than 550 in 130 zoos and a third of them are on
contraceptives because they are growing so quickly that we cannot find zoos
for them,' says <PERSON>Kleiman</PERSON>.
In <DATE>1983</DATE> the team of Brazilian and American scientists began the more
difficult process of reintroducing those born in captivity into the <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION>
rainforest in the Poco das Antas biological reserve south of Rio. So far 69
have been reintroduced with a 70 per cent survival rate and a further 60 are
to be reintroduced this year.
<PERSON>Denise Rambaldi</PERSON>, who heads the field programme, says that the animals
generally adapt quickly. 'Initially they do not know how to defend
themselves against predators and they fall over a lot because they're used
to stronger branches in their cages. But after the third tumble they usually
learn.'
According to <LOCATION>Rambaldi</LOCATION>, the main indicator of the project's success is the
ability of the reintroduced animals to breed among themselves and with their
wild cousins. Of 33 surviving offspring at least 10 are the result of
crossing wild and reintroduced tamarins, adding variety to the gene pool.
Family histories are kept on all former captive and wild tamarins to avoid
inbreeding.
'There is no doubt that the ability of once-captive tamarins to bear
offspring sometimes by mating with wild tamarins and their gradual ability
to feed themselves in the wild proves that reintroducing them into their old
habitat has been a success,' says <PERSON>Coimbra</PERSON>.
The project is special for several reasons, says <PERSON>Kleiman</PERSON>. Reintroducing
captive-born animals is a pioneering method of preserving species, and the
preservation of tropical forests is a developing science. It brings together
130 zoos, <ORGANIZATION>IBAMA</ORGANIZATION> (the Brazilian state environment agency), the World Wildlife
Fund and the <ORGANIZATION>Rio Primate Centre</ORGANIZATION>.
The success of the project is far from guaranteed. 'We're fighting against
time. In less than 20 years tamarins could be extinct in <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> and thus
worldwide', warns <PERSON>Coimbra</PERSON>.
The main problem is lack of forested land. The reserve is only 5,500
hectares, of which 60 per cent is covered by forest. Each group of five or
six monkeys requires 40 hectares of forest and <PERSON>Kleiman</PERSON> estimates that 20,000
hectares are needed to keep the 2,000 tamarins necessary for the breed's
sustainable survival. 'The larger aim of the project is to regenerate the
<LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> forest for tamarins and other endangered species,' she adds.
Consequently, the project's organisers are trying to involve private
business, aiming to raise Dollars 250,000 a year to buy remaining
forestland. So far they have persuaded 11 farmers to dedicate their
remaining forest to protection for the monkeys.
Another problem is a wave of tamarin robberies to sell on <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>'s black
market. At least 10 have been stolen in the <DATE>last year</DATE> and a publicity
programme has been launched to raise local consciousness.
'When we have the international community supporting the feeding and
maintenance of these animals outside <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>, sending them to <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> and then
hearing they have been stolen it does not look good for <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>,' warns
<PERSON>Kleiman</PERSON>.
One answer has been to hand every tamarin back in a special ceremony to the
Brazilian government to create more local responsibility. But <PERSON>Mr Jairo
Costa</PERSON>, President of the <ORGANIZATION>Brazilian Foundation for Conservation</ORGANIZATION> which helps
fund the project, believes a tougher crackdown on the trade is necessary.
'Catching an animal is regarded as a source of wealth. It is hard to
persuade someone with hunger in his stomach that for the sake of ecology he
should remain hungry.'

<LEADPARA>  AFRICAN SILENCES; By Peter Mathiessen  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Arts &amp; Books  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  PICTURES OF A DYING CONTINENT  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Books
Bierman, who wrote this review for the Los Angeles Times, is the author of
"Dark Safari: The Life Behind the Legend of Henry Morton Stanley."  </MEMO>
<TEXT>  <ORGANIZATION>Random House</ORGANIZATION>, 225 pp., <MONEY>$21</MONEY>; TWENTY years ago, <PERSON>Peter Mathiessen</PERSON> observed that
of all the African animals the elephant was the most difficult for man to live
with, but that its passing -- "if this must come" -- would be the most tragic
of all. At that time, millions of elephants still roamed the bush and the
forests of east, central and southern <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>, and the passing of the species
seemed unlikely. Today, with its number authoritatively estimated at about
700,000, the African elephant is officially designated a threatened species.
To avert the possibility of its extinction, international action was taken
last year to outlaw the trade in ivory.;    But while that ban has put a
virtual stop to the poaching, it may not save the creature from extinction.
For the biggest threat to the elephant's survival is not the automatic rifle
of the poacher but the panga of the native farmer, whose slash-and-burn
techniques destroy the elephant's habitat.;    Birth control suggested;  This
seems to be at least implicitly recognized even by the strongest proponents of
the ivory ban. Fifteen years ago, <LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION>'s elephant population numbered 65,000;
today it is fewer than one-third as many. Yet <LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION>'s director of wildlife
resources, <PERSON>Richard Leakey</PERSON>, who led the successful campaign for an ivory ban,
recently conceded that <LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION>, with its human population increasing at the rate
of almost <PERCENT>4 percent</PERCENT> a year, can never again support 65,000 elephants, and that
"20,000 in some places is too much.";    <PERSON>Leakey</PERSON>, with a perfectly straight
face, recently admitted in <ORGANIZATION>Time magazine</ORGANIZATION>, "We're looking at birth control --
vaginal rings. I don't know how they work." But the stronger likelihood is
that <PERSON>Leakey</PERSON> may eventually have to cull elephant herds by rifle fire. How else
can <LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION> protect the livelihood of the farmers whose small holdings the
elephants destroy?;    That kind of paradox is implicit but not directly
addressed in "African Silences," <PERSON>Mathiessen</PERSON>'s latest set of reflections upon
the state of the continent's wildlife. As the author points out, the almost
complete absence of wildlife in <LOCATION>West Africa</LOCATION> is a consequence of human
population pressure that now is consuming vast tracts of East and Central
African savannah and forest. In that context, it may prove to be irrelevant
whether the ban on ivory is renewed.;    Keen descriptions;  To the extent
that he fails to come to grips with such issues (or to make more than one
passing reference to AIDS, the scourge that will wipe out hundreds of
thousands of African humans before the end of the century), <PERSON>Mathiessen</PERSON> is not
at his justly celebrated best in "African Silences." Still, even on an off
day, the author of "The Snow Leopard" and "Killing <PERSON>Mister Watson</PERSON>" is more
worth reading than many of his contemporaries at their peak. And "Silences,"
though containing few fresh insights for readers acquainted with <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>, packs
<PERSON>Mathiessen</PERSON>'s characteristically fine descriptions.;    He is particularly good
on the mountain gorilla, and gives a hilarious account of a confrontation
between a band of the latter and a group of white tourists in northeastern
<LOCATION>Zaire</LOCATION>. "It is a standoff. On one side of this big thicket perhaps 30 large and
hairy primates are warning the restless young among them to be quiet, and on
the other a like number of large hairless ones are doing the same thing.";   
Turning to <PERSON>Homo sapiens</PERSON>, <PERSON>Mathiessen</PERSON> is enchanted by the joyful high spirits of
the Pygmy band whom he and some white conservationists accompany on a trek
into the unspoiled <ORGANIZATION>Ituri Forest</ORGANIZATION>. "We're here in the forest to be happy!"
exults a Pygmy elder. "No anger! We're here to be happy! Anybody who has a bad
spirit, keep it in town!" The Pygmies' engaging qualities are not appreciated
by their Bantu fellow countrymen, one of whom, a gendarme, tells <PERSON>Mathiessen</PERSON>'s
group that they have to be "treated like the animals they are.";    The book
contains some delicious mysteries. Does an unclassified race of "little
people" -- not the Pygmies, but some other human strain -- hide in the
vastness of the Central African rain forest? Rumor, legend and some
tantalizing scraps of evidence suggest that, like the Himalayan yeti or the
<LOCATION>Rocky Mountain Bigfoot</LOCATION>, such humanoids do exist, but <PERSON>Mathiessen</PERSON> has to concede
that the question remains open.;    Political revelations;  Although his
emphasis is very much on wildlife, <PERSON>Mathiessen</PERSON> allows himself some passages of
reflection on the dashed hopes and sour realities of African independence. He
is scathing about <LOCATION>Zaire</LOCATION>'s president-for-life, <PERSON>Mobutu Sese Seko</PERSON>, who has
oppressed and pillaged his people with a zeal and thoroughness that the
infamous <PERSON>King Leopold II</PERSON> of the Belgians -- founder of the horrendous "Congo
Free State" -- might have envied. The corruption and police-state brutalities
of the <PERSON>Mobutu</PERSON> regime go hand in hand with a leaden bureaucratic incompetence
that has brought a once-thriving economy to the brink of collapse. He is no
less censorious of those "inheritors of King Leopold's bloody legacy" who
still live in <LOCATION>Zaire</LOCATION> and continue to profit from their former colony. Still, as
the author observes, while the Belgians bled <LOCATION>Zaire</LOCATION>, "at least they knew how to
run the country." (box)  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Gorilla's First Date: No Monkey Business in Meeting 2 Females</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   <PERSON>Willie B.</PERSON>'s first date <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> wasn't exactly a
romantic triumph, but zoo keepers hope the shy, 31-year-old
gorilla's stroll in the jungle with two females is the start of
something big.
   The 450-pound primate, caged alone from infancy until <DATE>last year</DATE>,
was allowed outdoors with female companions for the first time at
<LOCATION>Zoo Atlanta</LOCATION>.
   Anxiously chaperoning the encounter were experts who want the
western lowland gorilla to mate but who worry the lonely male won't
know how to behave around the opposite sex.
   ``Today is the first day of the rest of <PERSON>Willie B.</PERSON>'s life as a
social animal,'' said zoo Director <PERSON>Terry Maple</PERSON>. ``Whether he will
reproduce is still an open question.''
   There wasn't any monkey business <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, but there were
encouraging signs during <PERSON>Willie</PERSON>'s encounter in the zoo's new <MONEY>$4.5
million</MONEY> African Rain Forest habitat.
   Willie wasn't aggressive toward the smaller females, in keeping
with the species' typical behavior that casts the female in the lead
mating role.
   At one point the younger female, 6-year-old Kinyani, approached
<PERSON>Willie</PERSON> briefly, then scampered off and sat. That's normal because
males and females don't have much to do with each other in most
circumstances, said <PERSON>Ronald Nadler</PERSON>, a gorilla specialist with the
<ORGANIZATION>Yerkes Regional Primate Research Center</ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION>Emory University</ORGANIZATION>.
   The females are on loan from <LOCATION>Yerkes</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Willie B.</PERSON>, who lived in a cage until the rain forest habitat
opened last year, was introduced to female gorillas gradually over
recent months. <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> was the first time they had been let
outdoors together, and they will share the habitat from now on.
   Chances of <PERSON>Willie B.</PERSON> mating ``are a long shot because he has been
isolated in captivity so long,'' said <PERSON>Sam Winslow</PERSON>, curator of
mammals at the zoo.
   Zoo keepers want <PERSON>Willie</PERSON>, a ``silverback,'' or adult male, to mate
and add to genetic diversity in the world's population of captive
gorillas.
   But this may be more important to <PERSON>Willie</PERSON> than his species: The
300 western lowland gorillas in zoos worldwide are reproducing at a
rate adequate to prevent inbreeding, <PERSON>Winslow</PERSON> said.
   <PERSON>Willie B.</PERSON>, a favorite with visitors, is named for former <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>
Mayor <PERSON>William B. Hartsfield</PERSON>.

   In the city where lawyers and accountants are
king, even the environmentalists wear gray flannel suits.
   Not so at <ORGANIZATION>Conservation International</ORGANIZATION>, where some brash, young
biologists who prefer jeans and khakis are running what they call
``a lean, mean conservation machine.''
   Since its founding in <DATE>January 1987</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Conservation International</ORGANIZATION>
has scored a string of rapid-fire successes.
   In <DATE>July 1987</DATE>, it executed the first debt-for-nature swap,
purchasing and forgiving <MONEY>$650,000</MONEY> of <LOCATION>Bolivia</LOCATION>'s foreign debt in
exchange for the country's establishment of a wildlife preserve
within its borders.
   Others had been talking about debt swaps for three years.
Conservation International put the first deal together when it was
only 6 months old.
   The group has tapped new sources of funds, enlisting such
unorthodox environmental advocates as the ``material girl,''
<PERSON>Madonna</PERSON>, who raised <MONEY>$200,000</MONEY> last year with her ``Don't Bungle the
Jungle'' concert in <LOCATION>Brooklyn</LOCATION>, and <PERSON>Bergdorf Goodman</PERSON>, which donated
<MONEY>$50,000</MONEY> from a benefit fashion show last <DATE>October</DATE>.
   The organization has established a conservation program in the
<ORGANIZATION>Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta</ORGANIZATION> massif on the coast of <LOCATION>Colombia</LOCATION>, where
government officials, campesinos and Indians maintain an uneasy
co-existence with guerillas and drug-runners.
   When the area's drug lords were convinced the field workers were
not from the <ORGANIZATION>CIA</ORGANIZATION> or setting up a competitive operation, they
allowed the program to continue.
   ``It's a classic example of how you can do conservation
anywhere,'' says <ORGANIZATION>Conservation International</ORGANIZATION>'s president, <PERSON>Russell
Mittermeier</PERSON>.
   ``CI reminds me of the <ORGANIZATION>Peace Corps</ORGANIZATION> in its early days, when it
was led by <PERSON>Sargent Shriver</PERSON> and it was thought that nothing was
undoable,'' says <PERSON>Patricia Kelly</PERSON>, vice president for communications
and a former <ORGANIZATION>Peace Corps</ORGANIZATION> volunteer.
   This <DATE>spring</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Conservation International</ORGANIZATION> will dispatch
environmental ``SWAT teams'' to assess urgent conservation needs in
eastern <LOCATION>Paraguay</LOCATION> and northern <LOCATION>Bolivia</LOCATION>, and will participate in the
<DATE>April 22</DATE> celebration of the <DATE>20th anniversary of Earth Day</DATE> with the
construction of a rain forest in a tent on the <ORGANIZATION>Mall</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION>
   The man responsible for much of this activity is <PERSON>Mittermeier</PERSON>,
40, a wildlife biologist with 20 years' experience in the tropics.
   A recent <ORGANIZATION>Conservation International</ORGANIZATION> report pictures him emerging
from a swamp in <LOCATION>Suriname</LOCATION>, covered with mud up to his neck holding a
wriggling Pipa pipa, or <LOCATION>Suriname</LOCATION> toad.
   ``We have a motto: `Heads in the sky, feet in the mud,''' says
<PERSON>Peter Seligmann</PERSON>, the board chairman and key fundraiser, who also is
trained in biology.
   <PERSON>Mittermeier</PERSON> has published more than 200 scientific papers, and
speaks six languages, including Surinamese. In <DATE>1974</DATE>, he
rediscovered the yellow-tailed woolly monkey in <LOCATION>Peru</LOCATION>, decades after
experts had decided it probably was extinct. A magazine article
dubbed him ``Russell of the Apes.''
   When he joined <ORGANIZATION>Conservation International</ORGANIZATION> last <DATE>May</DATE>, leaving a
post as vice president for science at the World Wildlife Fund, he
brought half a dozen other Fund scientists with him, including
long-time colleague <PERSON>Mark Plotkin</PERSON>, an authority on medicinal uses of
the rain forest.
   They joined a staff of 50, most of whom had made up the
international program at <ORGANIZATION>The Nature Conservancy</ORGANIZATION> until <DATE>January 1987</DATE>,
when a policy dispute led to a bitter split between the
international and domestic programs.
   <PERSON>Mittermeier</PERSON>'s office is appointed in a style that might be
called <ORGANIZATION>Early Smithsonian</ORGANIZATION>. Spears decorate one wall. Giant masks and
carved deities stare back from another. Boxes of slides and piles
of scientific monographs cover his desk, a large table and most of
the floor.
   ``Two things set us apart from other conservation
organizations,'' <PERSON>Mittermeier</PERSON> says.
   One is a reliance on local conservationists to run the programs
abroad.
   <PERCENT>Sixty percent</PERCENT> <ORGANIZATION>of Conservation International</ORGANIZATION>'s staff is Latin
American. The hallways echo with the sounds of Spanish, Portuguese,
Surinamese and Malagasy, the language of <LOCATION>Madagascar</LOCATION>.
   The second distinguishing feature, <PERSON>Mittermeier</PERSON> says, is its
strong scientific base, as exemplified by the conservation SWAT
teams.
   ``We're sending these guys out to spend a couple of weeks and
get an assessment of priorities,'' he says. ``That's going to help
us make sure we're focusing our money on the right things.''
   The teams will be made up of some of the world's best field
biologists, <PERSON>Mittermeier</PERSON> says. One is <PERSON>Theodore Parker</PERSON>, a recently
hired ornithologist.
   ``He can go into an area and identify <PERCENT>90 percent</PERCENT> of the birds in
two days,'' <PERSON>Mittermeier</PERSON> says. ``Not only by sightings. He can do it
by sound. He's got an incredible ear.''
   Scientists like <PERSON>Parker</PERSON> ``can do in a couple of weeks what can
take an ordinary scientist several years,'' says <PERSON>Mittermeier</PERSON>, who
plans to pay well for that expertise. ``The biologists should be
paid at least as much as the lawyers and accountants.''
   In <DATE>January</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Conservation International</ORGANIZATION> issued its master
conservation plan for the <DATE>1990s</DATE>, called ``The Rainforest
Imperative.'' The report sets priorities in 10 tropical hotspots
where urgent action is needed and in the five largest remaining
pieces of tropical wilderness.
   Many of these occur in the 12 nations <PERSON>Mittermeier</PERSON> calls
``megadiversity'' countries because together they contain <PERCENT>60
percent</PERCENT> of the world's plant and animal species, more animal and
plant diversity than is found anywhere else.
   Conservation International has established, or is planning,
conservation programs in nearly all of these places.
   ``Over the next decade, we have to approach the conservation of
biological diversity at the same level of intensity, dedication,
devotion and investment with which we approached the race to the
moon,'' <PERSON>Mittermeier</PERSON> says.

1,000 native tribes are being threatened with extinction as the rain forests
are depleted.;    Why are the rain forests being cut down? To make money. The
forests are often harvested for logging or leveled for cattle ranching.;   
What can we do? Many experts believe that the only way to save the rain
forests is to develop an alternative, "sustainable" rain forest economy --
that is, create an economy based on using nuts, leaves and other materials
that can be harvested from the rain forests without threatening their
survival. Scientists estimate that the sustainable bounty of the forest is
worth twice as much in the long run as the timber that can be logged or the
cattle that can be raised there.;    Frankly, it's up to us to provide the
market for sustainable rain forest products. And I'm pleased to report that a
growing number of them are available. One non-profit group, called Cultural
Survival, distributes items like cashews, <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> nuts, soaps, bath oil, dried
fruit and handicrafts nationwide. Contact the company at <ORGANIZATION>53A Church St.</ORGANIZATION>,
<LOCATION>Cambridge</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION> 02138, or at 617-495-2562, for a list of its products. It can
also supply educational materials.;    More sustainable products are popping
up all the time, so shop around; check out store and catalogs. Look for
products that come from the fruits of the rain forest but don't depend on
cutting down trees. As you find them, spread the word. For more information,
contact: The rain forest Action Network, 301 Broadway, Suite A, <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION> 94133. Send a self-addressed, stamped envelope for an updated list of
sustainable rain forest products.;    One individual can make a difference.
When many of his friends admired -- and even coveted -- his Latin American
straw hat, a "sustainable" product made from the leaves of rain forest plants,
<PERSON>Stefan Schinzinger</PERSON> began importing them. The fedora-style straw hat, braided

of the <ORGANIZATION>Tagua</ORGANIZATION> palm -- 10 million buttons in <DATE>1990</DATE> alone. Useful as a substitute

   The destruction of millions of acres of
tropical jungles each year by peasant farmers and others is a
problem for the developed nations as well as the Third World and
requires economic and educational solutions, say scientists at a
leading plant research institution.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Missouri Botanical Garden</ORGANIZATION>, known for its man-made tropical
atmosphere in the so-called ``Climatron'' designed by <PERSON>Buckminster
Fuller</PERSON>, is working to halt the decimation of the world's real
tropical jungles.
   ``The outlook is pretty grim,'' said biologist <PERSON>Peter H. Raven</PERSON>,
director of the garden. ``Although tropical forests once covered at
least <PERCENT>12 percent</PERCENT> of the globe _ an area about twice the size of
<LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> _ they have already been reduced to about half that.''
   ``Currently, the forests are being cleared or degraded at the
rate of about 60 million acres a year. That's an area about half
the size of <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>.''
   Raven said roughly half of all known plant and animal species on
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> are found in the tropical forests. At the current rate of
destruction, as many as 60,000 species of plants will be extinct by
the year <DATE>2020</DATE>.
   ``The plant-rich tropics supply man with a wealth of food crops,
medicines and other useful products,'' said <PERSON>Dr. Enrique Forero</PERSON>,
director of research at the garden. ``But they are being destroyed
rapidly.''
   The chief culprits, <PERSON>Forero</PERSON> said, are loggers and slash-and-burn
peasant farmers. The loggers obviously need the trees to stay in
business and the farmers often have to destroy the forests to feed
themselves and their families.
   And the scientists say the situation can only get worse unless
something is done to stop it.
   ``At present, over half the people in the world live in
countries that are at least partly tropical, excluding <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>,''
<PERSON>Forero</PERSON> said. ``Nearly a third of these people are already living in
extreme poverty and with current rates of growth, the human
population of these countries will double in less than 30 years.''
   ``How can you tell these starving people that you are going to
save the very things they have to destroy in order to sustain their
already meager existence,'' asked <ORGANIZATION>Raven</ORGANIZATION>. ``Education and political
and economic stability are obviously the keys. That and
understanding.''
   Which is why, <ORGANIZATION>Raven</ORGANIZATION> said, the garden has committed itself to an
all-out effort to explore, document and save the forests.
   With a staff of 70 researchers and technicians, including many
who live permanently in the tropics, the garden makes up one of the
world's largest active field research programs in tropical botany.
   The goals, the scientists said, are to collect the plant species
before they become extinct and to teach the impoverished farmers
how to live in the forest without destroying it.
   With the growing knowledge of genetics, they said, it is
important that the genes, the biological blueprints, of the
endangered species be saved.
   ``To lose this genetic capital through massive extinctions just
as we are developing our capabilities to explore its potential
would indeed be a tragedy,'' <ORGANIZATION>Raven</ORGANIZATION> said. ``The developments in
genetics make the specter of extinction even worse,'' <ORGANIZATION>Raven</ORGANIZATION> said.
``For each species of plant or animal lost to extinction, you're
losing the potential for another 20,000 to 30,000 variants in the
future.''
   Many of the plants, scientists say, could almost certainly be
developed into cheaper, easy-to-grow sources of highly nutritious
food. Others could be converted into abundant sources of new
medicines.
   Another important part of the garden's program is to lend
technical assistance to and train scientists from developing
tropical countries through cooperative agreements.
   ``Unfortunately, only <PERCENT>6 percent</PERCENT> of the scientists working on the
problem live in the countries involved,'' <ORGANIZATION>Raven</ORGANIZATION> said. ``We must
change that. Momentum to implement the innovative conservation and
development strategies needed to deal with these urgent problems
ultimately must come from the affected countries themselves,''
<ORGANIZATION>Raven</ORGANIZATION> said.
   The backbone of the garden's research, the scientists said, is
its herbarium, or plant collection. Along with the <ORGANIZATION>New York
Botanical Garden</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Smithsonian</ORGANIZATION> Institution, the <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION>
herbarium is one of the three largest in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and
among the 12 largest in the world.
   Started by garden founder <PERSON>Henry Shaw</PERSON> in the <DATE>1850s</DATE>, the <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION>
herbarium now contains samples of more than 3.5 million species and
is expected to expand to 4.5 million within the next decade.
   Pointing to a large map showing the locations of the garden's
researchers in Central and <LOCATION>South America</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Raven</ORGANIZATION> said of
the encroachment on the forests: ``It won't be stopped soon.
   ``But there are encouraging signs. What people have to learn is
that conservation and development are really two sides of the same
coin.''
   ``Producers and consumers have to learn that they have a common
problem. It can all be done, but it won't be easy.''

<LEADPARA>  Could foreign debt be the lever that moves poor countries to save their rain
forests?  (box)  President Bush apparently thinks so. The White House is
backing a bold program to channel billions of dollars that Latin American
governments owe Washington into local conservation projects.  (box)  "Debt for
nature" swaps are not new. Private groups are already busy raising cash to buy
up foreign debt, trading the IOUs back to the financially troubled debtors in
return for commitments to acquire parks and conserve environmental resources
in eight countries.  (box)  What is new is the possible addition of vast
quantities of government money to the pot -- and the prospect of a systematic,
well-financed defense of tropical forests that serve as a natural sink for
greenhouse gases and shelter the lion's share of the world's plant and animal
species.  (box)  William Reilly, the administrator of the Environmental
Protection Agency and the program's most influential champion, believes that a
successful reshuffling of some $12 billion in foreign aid loans by the United
States would mobilize $100 million a year for conservation projects.  (box) 
The approach could also serve as a model for European and Japanese
governments, which carry another $38 billion in Latin American debt.;    No
less important is that the plan requires the participation of local
environmentalists, who have often been excluded from decision-making.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  IOU ONE FOREST
CAN DEBT-FOR-NATURE SWAPS SAVE THE TREES?  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     <PERSON>John Sawhill</PERSON>, the head of the <ORGANIZATION>Nature Conservancy</ORGANIZATION>, an active promoter of
debt-for-nature swaps, argues that the resulting public-private partnerships
could tilt local interests in favor of environmental protection.;    The big
question now is whether <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, preoccupied by war in the <LOCATION>Persian Gulf</LOCATION> and
recession at home, is sufficiently committed to the swap idea to plow through
the political and financial obstacles.;    Much depends on the
administration's flexibility in determining which Latin debtors are eligible.;
   For its part, <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> will either have to allow some creative accounting
on the debt shuffle or will have to add new foreign aid money to the budget.; 
  Idea was born in <DATE>1984</DATE>;  <PERSON>Thomas Lovejoy</PERSON>, an ecologist now at the <ORGANIZATION>Smithsonian
Institution</ORGANIZATION>, dreamed up the idea of linking foreign debt relief to the
financing of domestic environmental projects back in <DATE>1984.</DATE>;    At the time,
crushing foreign debts had led most poor countries to cut back on
environmental protection. Why not wipe out part of the debts denominated in
dollars and yen for commitments to spend cruzeiros and pesos on conservation?;
   But it was private organizations, not governments or commercial banks, that
turned theory into practice. In the very first swap in <DATE>1987</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Conservation
International</ORGANIZATION>, an American group, paid <MONEY>$100,000</MONEY> for an uncollectible <MONEY>$650,000</MONEY>
that <LOCATION>Bolivia</LOCATION> owed to <LOCATION>Citicorp.</LOCATION>;    The group then agreed to wipe out <LOCATION>Bolivia</LOCATION>'s
<MONEY>$650,000</MONEY> debt in return for its promise to protect a 3.7-million-acre buffer
around the <ORGANIZATION>Beni Biosphere Reserve</ORGANIZATION> and to spend the equivalent of <MONEY>$250,000</MONEY> in
local currency to manage the reserve.;    Agreements around the globe; Since
then, 14 other debt-for-nature swaps have been carried out, reducing external
debts and protecting forests in <LOCATION>Ecuador</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Costa Rica</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Madagascar</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Zambia</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>Dominican Republic</LOCATION> and Poland.;    Clever financing
arrangements, along with the enthusiastic cooperation of environmentally
sensitive governments, have magnified the effects of the <MONEY>$16 million</MONEY>
investment far beyond initial expectations.;    But as <PERSON>Sawhill</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Nature
Conservancy</ORGANIZATION> points out, dependence on charitable donations has limited the
overall impact on the global environment to "peanuts." That's why
environmental groups, led by the World Wildlife Fund in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, worked
hard to make a federal case for intervention.;    They struck pay dirt last
<DATE>June</DATE> when President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> included debt-for-nature swaps in his "Enterprise for
the Americas" initiative -- a broad effort to pare debt, liberalize trade and
stimulate investment in <LOCATION>Latin America</LOCATION> and the Caribbean.;    In <DATE>October</DATE>,
<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> authorized swaps for some <MONEY>$1.7 billion</MONEY> in debts incurred in the sales
of subsidized food.;    The president is expected to ask that the swaps be
extended to loans made by the <ORGANIZATION>United States Agency for International
Development</ORGANIZATION>, as well as <ORGANIZATION>Export-Import Bank</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Commodity Credit Corp.</ORGANIZATION> loans
originally used to subsidize <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> exports.;    To be eligible, debtor
countries will have to pass muster on a number of criteria -- what one
environmental lobbyist calls the "flaming hoops.";    They must be actively
working to make deals with their other big creditors, in particular the <ORGANIZATION>World
Bank</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>International Monetary Fund</ORGANIZATION> and the commercial banks. And they must
open their borders to foreign investors on reasonable terms.;    The carrot is
substantial debt relief. The administration is targeting a <PERCENT>50 percent</PERCENT>
write-off. Payments forgiven by the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Treasury</ORGANIZATION> would be converted to local
currencies and deposited in national environmental funds.;    The money could
be used for anything from conservation training to restoration of the world's
oceans and atmosphere. But outlays would be planned and supervised by boards
that include private citizens nominated by the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> government.  </TEXT>

<BYLINE>By DONNA FENN HEINTZEN</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Clad in traditional Arabian robes
and headdress, <PERSON>Dr. Lawrence Curtis</PERSON> sits in his study, surrounded by
the things he loves _ an extensive zoological library, three snakes
and a scorpion that paces in a small box.
   Every so often, a curious ostrich peers through the window.
   Home for <PERSON>Curtis</PERSON> is <LOCATION>Riyadh</LOCATION>'s zoo.
   The 58-year-old Texan was hired specially to establish a zoo in
this oil-rich nation and sometime in the future, he said, ``<LOCATION>Saudi
Arabia</LOCATION> may be breeding more endangered species than many advanced
countries.''
   Curtis spent 15 years as a zoo director in <LOCATION>Fort Worth</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>,
and another 15 in <LOCATION>Oklahoma City</LOCATION>.
   ``I was bored with conventional zoos,'' he said, and 18 months
ago heard that <LOCATION>Riyadh</LOCATION> was planning to open a zoo and needed a
director. He packed enough clothes for two weeks and headed for the
Saudi capital.
   He was hired on the spot and given just four months to prepare
for the zoo's opening in <DATE>March 1987</DATE>.
   Today, the <LOCATION>Riyadh</LOCATION> zoo is home to 1,200 animals, many of them
endangered species. It is also an oasis, carpeted in lush grass and
filled with flower beds, bubbling man-made streams, small trees,
and flowering vines thriving in the highly irrigated desert soil.
   Nearly 7,000 visitors a day pass through its gates _ men on
<DATE>Mondays</DATE>, <DATE>Wednesdays</DATE> and <DATE>Fridays</DATE> and veiled women on <DATE>Tuesdays</DATE>,
<DATE>Thursdays</DATE> and <DATE>Sundays</DATE>, in accordance with <LOCATION>Saudi Arabia</LOCATION>'s Islamic
tradition of separating the sexes.
   To <LOCATION>Riyadh</LOCATION>'s residents, the zoo is a welcome change of scenery.
To <PERSON>Curtis</PERSON>, the zoo is much more.
   ``I really wanted our zoo to have an international reputation
for conservation,'' he said.
   One of his first tasks was to help persuade the municipality to
issue a policy statement supporting the <ORGANIZATION>Convention of International
Trade</ORGANIZATION> in Endangered Species (CITES), a treaty designed to protect
wild animals in their native countries.
   Saudi Arabia supports the treaty although it has yet to sign it
_ a point Curtis thinks will change soon _ but the expression of
support made it easy for him to get colleagues all over the world
to help stock the zoo.
   In keeping with CITES guidelines, no endangered species were
collected from the wild.
   An Arabian leopard and an ibex were shipped from <LOCATION>Cincinnati</LOCATION>'s
zoo. Pigmy hippos came from the <LOCATION>Bronx Zoo</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION>. <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>
sent antelopes. <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Duke University</ORGANIZATION> sent lemurs.
<LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> contributed a scimiter horned oryx, and a golden lion
marmoset came from <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION>
   The zoo in <LOCATION>Cairo</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>, sent giant tortoises, the <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION> zoo
a crocodile, the <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION> zoo in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> a kangaroo and two tapirs
arrived from the zoo in <LOCATION>Lima</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Peru</LOCATION>.
   Bedouins, the nomads who live in <LOCATION>Saudi Arabia</LOCATION>'s desert, brought
in lizards, a caracal and a hyena in the back of pick-up trucks.
And so it went, until the zoo's eclectic collection rivaled those
of its more established counterparts.
   ``We've got an Indian mynah who speaks Arabic, and a parrot who
speaks Swahili,'' said <PERSON>Curtis</PERSON>. ``He's next to a macaw from <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>
and you know what they speak there (Portuguese). We really have a
multilingual zoo; it's like the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION>.''
   Getting the animals to <LOCATION>Riyadh</LOCATION> was only half the chore.
   ``The big challenge was acclimatization,'' <PERSON>Curtis</PERSON> said. ``We had
to make a lot of modifications.'' Upon his arrival, he was given a
list of animals approved for acquisition but he rejected some as
inappropriate.
   A wild horse was scratched for want of adequate running space,
and several poisonous snakes were eliminated due to lack of staff
expertise in handling them. Many animals need special care in order
to thrive in <LOCATION>Riyadh</LOCATION>'s desert climate.
   ``The key to acclimatization is spraying and misting systems, so
we installed a lot of that,'' <PERSON>Curtis</PERSON> said. The zoo also invested in
shade cloth, which cuts out <PERCENT>80 percent</PERCENT> of sunlight in the <DATE>summer</DATE>
months, when temperatures often reach 122 degrees.
   Reptiles accustomed to high humidity are sprayed with water.
   Like his charges, <PERSON>Curtis</PERSON> seems to have adapted to his new
environment. He wears the local robes and headdress, known as a
thobe and ghutra.
   He takes frequent desert trips to study and photograph <LOCATION>Saudi
Arabia</LOCATION>'s native fauna.
   ``This country has made remarkable progress. It has a big
commitment to conservation,'' <PERSON>Curtis</PERSON> said. ``They've already
created national parks, there's an endangered species list, and
we've got endangered species legislation coming up.''

FT  16 MAR 92 / Survey of Nigeria (22): Not yet out of the woods - Julian
Ozanne ventures through a protected rain forest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFRICA'S blazing sun rarely penetrates the thick evergreen canopy of the
Okumu rain forest, one of the last protected areas of primeval rain forest
in <LOCATION>Nigeria</LOCATION>'s southern equatorial belt.
Amid huge mahoganies, irokos and other tropical hardwoods which stretch up
to the light through dense green foliage, it is possible to imagine what it
was like before man walked the earth.
As you slash your way through matted vegetation, which appears to have
rioted in a frenzy of anarchy, the stillness of the forest is suddenly
broken by cracking branches. Baboons and monkeys, including the rare
white-throated monkey found only in <LOCATION>Nigeria</LOCATION>, scatter quickly at the sound of
human approach, swinging through the trees, some of which are over 150
metres tall.
Other animals - including buffalo, elephant, duiker and genet  - are equally
cautious of human encroachment. Insects, snakes and birds, including many
varieties of African parrot, are abundant and locals swear by the medicinal
properties of many trees.
Six years ago, logging was banned within 112 sqaure kilometres of the
forest, and the government and the <ORGANIZATION>Nigerian Conservation Foundation</ORGANIZATION>
established a sanctuary in the Okumu forest, in Edo state. The sanctuary
policy may be one of the last hopes for preserving an invaluable gene pool
of flora and fauna in the face of the ravages of timber merchants, farmers
and hunters.
<LOCATION>Nigeria</LOCATION>'s southern states were once covered by rain forest. Fifty years of
uncontrolled exploitation, rapid population growth and land pressure have
taken a devastating toll on thousands of square kilometres of primary
forest. According to estimates, only 5 per cent of the original rain forest
cover is left today. The last 15 per cent disappeared in the past 15 years.
Many species of flora and fauna, perhaps vital to medical research, were
destroyed before they could be discovered.
About 150km south of the Okumu forest, in the timber town of <LOCATION>Sapele</LOCATION>, the
evidence of continued wanton destruction is starkly apparent. Along the lush
banks of the Jemeson river, hundreds of small saw millers, who account for
an estimated 90 per cent of total timber products, have set up operations in
corrugated tin shacks. In the water, hundreds of tropical hardwood logs,
tied together by rope and chains, have been floated down river.
According to a senior executive of African Timber and <ORGANIZATION>Plywood Company</ORGANIZATION>, a
division of <ORGANIZATION>United Africa Company</ORGANIZATION> (UAC), at least <MONEY>40-50 per cent</MONEY> of the
small saw millers' throughput is illegally logged.
'We only take trees with a girth of more than 1.3 metres,' said the
executive. 'This gives the forest a chance to partially regenerate. But the
illegal loggers come in after us and cut down trees with much smaller
girths.'
A further problem is that government concessions are granted on a maximum
period of between five and 10 years - too short to encourage the operators
to have a sustainable logging strategy which would allow the forest to
recover. Many concessions were also granted, under the regime of former
President <PERSON>Shehu Shagari</PERSON>, to little-known operators without a proper analysis
of their economic impact.
Reports from <LOCATION>Sapele</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Warri</LOCATION> also suggest that, in spite of a government
ban on timber exports, logs and sawn timber continue to leave the country
illegally.
Efforts by the big timber companies, such as A <ORGANIZATION>T &amp; P</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Piedmont Timber</ORGANIZATION>, to
switch their raw material source to plantation forests such as Gmalina have
little impact on deforestation. Plans to start regeneration projects are
costly and unlikely to come into effect without significant funds from
foreign donors.
'The real problem is the massive, seemingly unstoppable population explosion
and the complete inability of the government to police the controls it has
established,' says one environmentalist. 'Its a very bleak picture for the
future of the environment.'
The continuing destruction of the rain forests of southern <LOCATION>Nigeria</LOCATION> has
already had serious effects on severe soil erosion - common in the southern
states of Edo, <LOCATION>Anambra</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Imo</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Abia</LOCATION> - and to the silting of rivers, which
threatens <LOCATION>Nigeria</LOCATION>'s unique mangrove swamps with their rich ecosystem and
fish-breeding potential. The deforestation has also had unquantifiable
effects on the threat to the ozone layer and on biological diversity.
'In <LOCATION>Nigeria</LOCATION> now, the situation with rain forests is a stop-gap
backs-against-the-wall conservation effort,' says <PERSON>Mr Philip Hall</PERSON> of the
<ORGANIZATION>Nigerian Conservation Foundation</ORGANIZATION>. 'We have to realise that there is no such
thing as successful sustainable managed forestry. It has not yet been
demonstrated anywhere.'
<PERSON>Mr Hall</PERSON> believes the remedy lies in conservation efforts which compensate
farmers in the surrounding areas, in return for denying them the
exploitation of the rain forest. In <LOCATION>Okumu</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Oban Hills</LOCATION>, in eastern
<LOCATION>Nigeria</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Cross River</LOCATION> state, the <ORGANIZATION>NCF</ORGANIZATION> is pioneering agricultural projects
such as bee-keeping and fish-farming for the local residents, as
alternatives to logging and hunting.
Destruction of the rain forests is one of the many severe environmental
problems facing <LOCATION>Nigeria</LOCATION> and its population of 110m, which almost tripled
between <DATE>1963</DATE> and <DATE>1991</DATE> and is still growing at an estimated 3.4 per cent a
year. In the arid savannahs of the north and middle-belt zones, rapid
deforestation for firewood and overgrazing is already causing
desertification, and could lead to an energy crisis.
A recent <ORGANIZATION>World Bank</ORGANIZATION> report said <LOCATION>Nigeria</LOCATION> was losing Dollars 5bn a year as a
result of environmental degradation caused by soil damage, water
contamination, deforestation, desertification, flooding, gully and coastal
erosion, inefficient sewerage, water hyacinth and fishery and wildlife
destruction.
The recent establishment of a <ORGANIZATION>Federal Environmental Protection Agency</ORGANIZATION> and a
<ORGANIZATION>National Resources Conservation Council</ORGANIZATION> are steps in the right direction.
But time is running out.
'The government must take more radical and politically difficult decisions
fast and enforce them rigidly,' said <PERSON>Mr Hall</PERSON>. 'Otherwise a major,
irreversible environmental crisis is just around the corner.'

   ``Extinction is Forever'' is the
motto at naturalist <PERSON>Gerald Durrell</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>Jersey Wildlife Preservation
Trust</ORGANIZATION>. Its symbol is the dodo, the flightless, turkey-like bird of
<LOCATION>Mauritius</LOCATION> that became extinct in the <DATE>1690s</DATE>.
   It's goal is to keep more of the world's animals from becoming
extinct.
   The zoo boasts the world's most comprehensive collection of
endangered species. It protects animals by breeding them in
captivity and returning their offspring to the wild.
   On 25 beautifully landscaped acres of <LOCATION>Jersey</LOCATION>, the main island of
the English Channel archipelago, the zoo tries to recreate natural
settings for its charges.
   The trust also trains interns from all over the world to promote
animal survival in their own countries.
   ``We are not trying to maintain a living museum,'' said <PERSON>Anthony
Allchurch</PERSON>, the zoo's general administrator. ``We have a job to do.
If it happens that the public is interested in what we're doing,
that's great.''
   Founded in <DATE>1959</DATE>, the zoo started out as a place where <PERSON>Durrell</PERSON>
kept the animals he collected during his expeditions. Four years
later, he formed the trust as a registered charity.
   ``The release of animals back into their natural habitat is the
ultimate goal for each of the species that we so carefully
nurture,'' <PERSON>Durrell</PERSON> has said.
   The white-bearded, 64-year-old Briton lives in <LOCATION>Les Augres Manor</LOCATION>
on the zoo grounds with his American wife Lee but was traveling and
unavailable to talk about his project with a visiting reporter.
   His books have been published in 26 languages. The best known is
``My Family and Other Animals,'' about his childhood on the Greek
island of <LOCATION>Corfu</LOCATION>. He also has produced numerous television
documentaries about animals. He is the younger brother of the famed
novelist <PERSON>Lawrence Durrell</PERSON>, author of the ``<LOCATION>Alexandria</LOCATION> Quartet'' and
other works.
   The zoo concentrates on six major geographical areas: northern
<LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Nepal</LOCATION>, southeastern <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Madagascar</LOCATION>, and the <LOCATION>Mascarene Islands</LOCATION> in the <LOCATION>Indian Ocean</LOCATION>.
   It works closely with governments, wildlife groups, and other
zoos, including the National Zoo in <LOCATION>Washington D.C.</LOCATION>
   ``If we didn't work with government support and blessing, we
wouldn't achieve half of what we do,'' <PERSON>Allchurch</PERSON> said.
   The first animals that the zoo returned to a natural habitat were
14 pink pigeons that were placed in a botanical garden in the
<LOCATION>Mascarene</LOCATION> island of <LOCATION>Mauritius</LOCATION> in <DATE>1984</DATE>.
   Three years later, the zoo placed pink pigeons in an area of
native forest that hadn't been inhabited by these birds for 10
years. To date, 19 have been returned to the wilderness, and,
significantly, two have been born there.
   ``We don't befriend, socialize, train or handle animals, to
enhance their chance of surviving the wild, if they ever get
there,'' <PERSON>Allchurch</PERSON> said.
   The zoo also sent Jamaican hutias, large brown rodents, back to
their island and is returning kestrels to <LOCATION>Mauritius</LOCATION>.
   ``A lot of rare animals are dull and brown. But two dull brown
parents with a baby are very exciting,'' <PERSON>Allchurch</PERSON> said.
   The zoo also has been a partner in programs to return golden lion
tamarins to <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Bali</LOCATION> starlings to <LOCATION>Indonesia</LOCATION> and thick-billed
parrots to <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>.
   In <DATE>1978</DATE>, the trust established its training program, which has
educated some 250 trainees from more than 40 countries. Many already
have had veterinary training, and they spend two to four months at
the zoo.
   ``You learn a lot. It's a great place here,'' said <PERSON>Susana
Ringenbach</PERSON>, a 27-year-old trainee from <LOCATION>Tlalpan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>. `You can
learn to educate the children not to go out and hunt.''
   She said she was inspired by <PERSON>Durrell</PERSON>'s books and is particularly
interested in helping jaguars and spider monkeys.
   The trust has annual income of <MONEY>$2.2 million</MONEY>, <PERCENT>60 percent</PERCENT> of it
from entrance fees. About 340,000 people visited the zoo <DATE>last year</DATE>.
   The remainder of the financing comes from private donations.
Along with its sister trusts in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>, it has
20,000 members.

   Helicopters carrying water-filled ``Bambi
buckets'' have helped officials control a fire that threatened to
destroy the world's first project to restore rare captive monkeys
to the wild in <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>.
   ``We were probably days away from the extinction of a species,''
said <PERSON>Benjamin Beck</PERSON>, associate director of the <ORGANIZATION>National Zoo</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION>
   The fire was fought with two helicopters belonging to the
Brazilian federal police. When a call came to <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> alerting
<PERSON>Beck</PERSON> to the fire, the Friends of the <ORGANIZATION>National Zoo</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Wildlife
Preservation Trust</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> immediately raised <MONEY>$6,000</MONEY> to
send two ``Bambi buckets'' to the reserve, <PERSON>Beck</PERSON> said <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   ``From the time the request came to me, until they were in use
in <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>, was less than 72 hours,'' he said.
   A Bambi bucket, <PERSON>Beck</PERSON> explained, is a large vessel that hangs
beneath the helicopter and allows the aircraft to dip into bodies
of water, without landing, and drop the water on the fire.
   ``The fire is, we feel, under control, but it's still burning
deep in turf in the swamps,'' <PERSON>Beck</PERSON> said.
   Enough organic matter and oxygen are available to keep the fire
smouldering, he said, adding:
   ``If it gets dry and windy, it can break out at any time.''
   The National Zoo has been coordinating a project to breed the
highly endangered golden lion tamarins and return them to the Poco
das Antas reserve in <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>, about 75 miles northeast of <ORGANIZATION>Rio de
Janeiro</ORGANIZATION>.
   The fire broke out about <DATE>Feb. 2</DATE> at Poco das Antas, home to about
400 tamarins. They make up about <PERCENT>80 percent</PERCENT> of the remaining wild
population, <PERSON>Beck</PERSON> said.
   <ORGANIZATION>Sonia Rigueira of Conservation International</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> said
the fire burned about a week. ``They lost control for a while, and
then they got the helicopters,'' she said in a telephone interview
from <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>.
   The fire was confined to the grassy areas that make up about
half of the reserve, she said. The other half _ mature forest where
the tamarins live _ was undisturbed, she said.
   ``Had the fire progressed into the mature forest, we would have
seen this species come to extinction,'' said <PERSON>Beck</PERSON>.
   The golden lion tamarin is a cat-size primate with a leonine
mane and bright, burnt-orange fur. It is native to <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>'s
<LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> coastal forest, which once covered <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>'s eastern flank
but is now reduced to patches comprising only a few percent of its
original size.
   ``It is a beautiful and interesting primate,'' <PERSON>Beck</PERSON> said. ``But
probably more important is, if it can survive, virtually the entire
ecosystem can survive.''
   The golden lion tamarin is what biologists call a flagship
species. Its survival depends on the health of the ecosystem it
lives in.
   Saving the golden lion tamarin is inextricably linked with
saving what remains of the <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> coastal forest, a unique region
brimming with plants and animals that live nowhere else on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>,
<PERSON>Beck</PERSON> said.
   The animals and the reserve could not have been saved without
the effort by <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Beck</PERSON> said.
   ``We ought to give credit to a tremendous response by Brazilian
authorities,'' he said.

<DATE>Saturday</DATE>'s RITZ (Rendezvous in the Zoo) gala may have been for the birds, but 
it also was for the chimpanzees, the duck-billed platypuses, the hangnailed 
sloths and the other creatures who have come to call the <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> Zoo their 
home away from the jungle, veld and rain forest. 
</P>
<P>
More than 850 primates paid well to take a gander at the wild geese, timid 
toucans and cocky cockatoos that have made the zoo one of the planet's prime 
entrepots for man and beast, with the result that more than <MONEY>$150,000</MONEY> was raised 
toward the construction of a new enclosure for the zoo's pygmy chimpanzees. 
RITZ also officially opened the <DATE>summer</DATE> social season, and was widely 
appreciated as a sort of festive monsoon that relieved the long dry spell of 
second-rate celebrations that had left circuit regulars gasping for a refresher 
course in how to party in high style. 
</P>
<P>
RITZ specifically honored <PERSON>King Tut</PERSON>, the salmon-crested cockatoo who had been, 
until the previous day, the zoo's official greeter since his arrival on <DATE>March 
25, 1925</DATE>. Zoo officials claimed that the above-average avian has welcomed more 
than 100 million visitors to the park, which may explain why, in its first 
taste of retirement, the bird turned his back on the black-tie crowd and 
callously crunched bird seed when he should have been issuing caws of greeting. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, the <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> crowd proved that it has room in its heart for a 
cockatoo or two by clustering around Tut both during the cocktail hour and 
later, when the bird was given a triumphal parade through the open-air 
ballroom. 
</P>
<P>
In its sixth annual incarnation, RITZ provided (as it always does) the 
opportunity for rare meetings between man and beast. The wandering Dorothies in 
the crowd chanted rather pointlessly for lions, tigers and bears -- all these 
were kept at bay -- but it was possible to have close encounters with llamas, 
camels, elephants, Clydesdales and miniature horses, since the zoo was 
determined to show its treasures at close range. Except during the first course 
of the dinner, fish were excluded from the proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
RITZ opened in traditional fashion with a cocktail-hour meander through <ORGANIZATION>Primate 
Mesa</ORGANIZATION>, where man and monkey had the opportunity to observe one another at 
leisure and draw appropriate conclusions. The formally dressed participants in 
this annual stand-off had the better deal, though, because champagne was passed 
liberally and the hors d'oeuvres buffets yielded such notable tidbits as smoked 
oyster canapes and sizzling conch fritters. While monkeys have been known to 
ape mankind, none of these refreshments enjoy great repute on the simian table 
d'hote. 
</P>
<P>
The dress code somewhat needlessly encouraged "jungle elegance," which resulted 
in so many women in leopard prints that spots seemed to swim before one's eyes; 
the invitations also, in honor of Tut, invited Egyptian garb, with the result 
that 
</P>
<P>
many Cleopatras and even several Rameses held center stage. 
</P>
<P>
Dinner was announced separately by chairwoman <PERSON>Alison Tibbitts</PERSON>, who summoned the 
faithful to table from atop <PERSON>Walter</PERSON> the camel, a domesticated dromedary, and by 
the deep brass tones of a Japanese gong, which a zoo staffer pounded with 
unfettered delight. The meal was served al fresco in a starlit space engagingly 
decorated by design chiefs <PERSON>Dick Ford</PERSON> and <PERSON>Liz Smith</PERSON> to resemble an ancient 
Egyptian boit de nuit. Giant, lighted standards of cockatoo Tut in Pharaonic 
garb rose high above the tables and defined the ballroom. Best of all, if 
utterly unplanned, was a triumphant full moon that, in the sudden absence of 
<DATE>June</DATE> gloom, rode high above the party through the <TIME>night</TIME>. 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>Wayne Foster Orchestra</ORGANIZATION> and a subsidiary Foster rock band called Sparkle 
alternated on two dance floors for the duration. 
</P>
<P>
Guests had barely had time to dig into their interesting first course of 
vegetable terrine when master of ceremonies <PERSON>Rolf Benirschke</PERSON> announced the 
traditional parade of animals. Led by the zoo's good-will ambassador <PERSON>Joan 
Embery</PERSON>, the parade commenced rather tamely with <PERSON>Embery</PERSON> driving a 
Clydesdale-drawn shay, but picked up when a zebra, a cheetah and a lemur joined 
the procession. 
</P>
<P>
The parade reached its peak when <PERSON>Tibbitts</PERSON> and zoo board President <PERSON>Al Anderson</PERSON> 
careened into the ballroom atop <PERSON>Carol</PERSON> the elephant, who wore a double necklace 
of bells and jingled grandly as she sashayed among the tables. (<PERSON>Carol</PERSON> used her 
trunk to pick the winning ticket in the raffle for a <DATE>1989</DATE> Mercury Cougar, which 
led <PERSON>Benirschke</PERSON>, who shortly will leave his job as daytime host of a television 
game show, to wisecrack, "It's just like 'Wheel of Fortune,' we're giving away 
a car." <ORGANIZATION>Gordon Bell of El Cajon</ORGANIZATION> held the winning ticket.) 
</P>
<P>
A clever dessert of meringue cockatoos followed the cabbage-leaf-wrapped filet 
mignon entrees, and released the guests to alternately contemplate <PERSON>King Tut</PERSON>'s 
long career and to step out gamely to Foster's stylish Big Band 
interpretations. 
</P>
<P>
The guest list included <PERSON>Helen</PERSON> and <PERSON>James Davis</PERSON>; zoo director <PERSON>Doug Myers</PERSON> and his 
wife, <PERSON>Barbara; Ruth and Jim Mulvaney</PERSON>; <PERSON>Audrey Geisel</PERSON>; <PERSON>Dick Duffy</PERSON>; <PERSON>Judy</PERSON> and <PERSON>Chuck 
Bieler</PERSON>; <PERSON>Alison</PERSON> and <PERSON>George Gildred</PERSON>; <PERSON>Mary</PERSON> and <PERSON>Bruce Hazard</PERSON>; <PERSON>Judith Harris</PERSON> with 
<PERSON>Robert Singer</PERSON>; <PERSON>Tisha Swortwood</PERSON>; <PERSON>Betty Jo</PERSON> and <PERSON>Hal Williams</PERSON>; <PERSON>Junko</PERSON> and <PERSON>Larry 
Cushman</PERSON>; <PERSON>Dottie</PERSON> and <PERSON>Patrick Haggerty</PERSON>; <PERSON>Betty</PERSON> and Al deBakcsy; <PERSON>Mary</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Dallas

and <PERSON>Bob Adelizzi</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
LA JOLLA -- Earlier the same day, the <ORGANIZATION>San Diego County Mental Health Hospital 
Auxiliary</ORGANIZATION> cleaned up (as it were) at the second annual <ORGANIZATION>Black Tie Car Wash &amp; 
Cafe</ORGANIZATION>, a sudsy, daylong frolic at which several score of the well-known 
meticulously scrubbed several hundred autos. 
</P>
<P>
Auxiliary President <PERSON>Lois Kolender</PERSON> (whose husband, former Police Chief <PERSON>Bill 
Kolender</PERSON>, was among those wielding hoses and soapy rags), said the event was 
intended more to attract visibility for the hospital than to earn substantial 
funds, although at <MONEY>$15</MONEY> a car the proceeds did amount to a respectable figure. 
The auxiliary works for the benefit of patients and provides therapeutic 
equipment, clothing and personal care items. 
</P>
<P>
The car wash is the brainchild of chairwoman <PERSON>Nancy Hester</PERSON>, who also founded La 
Jolla's annual "Off-the-Wall" street dance, given every <DATE>August</DATE> for the <ORGANIZATION>UC San 
Diego Medical Center</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
While there is nothing unusual about a car wash per se, the <ORGANIZATION>Black Tie</ORGANIZATION> Car Wash 
is a definitely trendy variant, and <DATE>Saturday</DATE>'s edition occasionally tied up 
traffic along <PERSON>Girard Avenue</PERSON> as gowned and tuxedoed shills directed a string of 
luxury sedans and economy models into the parking lot of <ORGANIZATION>San Diego Trust &amp; 
Savings Bank</ORGANIZATION>. There was a definite benefit to the experience, since cars did 
emerge sparkling, but the amusement value lay in the identities of the car wash 
staff, which numbered some of the leading political, business and social 
figures in the county. 
</P>
<P>
Former City Councilman and mayoral candidate <PERSON>Bill Cleator</PERSON> worked side-by-side 
with philanthropist <PERSON>Joe Hibben</PERSON>, restaurateur <PERSON>Ron Zappardino</PERSON> and <LOCATION>San Diego 
Symphony</LOCATION> board member <PERSON>Linda Hooberman</PERSON>, and hotelier <PERSON>Ann Evans</PERSON> joined publishing 
consultant <PERSON>Janet Gallison</PERSON> in flipping burgers in the impromptu cafe. In the 
background, one-man band <ORGANIZATION>Ira Cobb</ORGANIZATION> set the mood by offering such tunes as "Come 
Away With Me <PERSON>Lucille</PERSON>, in My Merry Oldsmobile." 
</P>
<P>
The car washers played as they sprayed, and onlookers who wandered too close to 
the work area could find themselves suddenly drenched by a well-aimed hose. 
Cleator remarked that the job was not that different from serving on the <ORGANIZATION>City 
Council</ORGANIZATION>, and radio executive <PERSON>Paul Palmer</PERSON> said the washers had taken as their 
motto, "When we're finished with your car, it will look a little bit better." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Hester</PERSON> said there had been a few snafus. Just before the event began, the keys 
to the water outlet were lost, and three car alarms were set off during washing 
-- but she added that the group was having fun and making money for the 
hospital, which she said was all to the good. 
</P>
<P>
Among other volunteers were <PERSON>Anne Jones</PERSON>, <PERSON>Rob Butterfield</PERSON>, <PERSON>George Munger</PERSON>, <PERSON>Marilyn 
Cleator</PERSON>, <PERSON>Robin Mackenzie</PERSON>, <PERSON>Melanie Cohrs</PERSON>, <PERSON>Bob Cluck</PERSON>, <PERSON>Carol Vistrand</PERSON>, <PERSON>Vicki Eddy</PERSON>,

<TEXT>
   The chaotic development that is gobbling up the
<LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> rain forest could finally be reined in with a new plan
developed by officials of <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> countries and leading scientists
from around the world.
   ``That's some of the most encouraging news about the <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> rain
forest in recent years,'' said <PERSON>Thomas Lovejoy</PERSON>, a tropical ecologist
at the <ORGANIZATION>Smithsonian</ORGANIZATION> Institution and an <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> specialist.
   ``It contrasts markedly with a year ago, when there was nothing
to read about conservation in the <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION>, especially in <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>,
except bad news,'' <PERSON>Lovejoy</PERSON> said in a recent interview.
   Sixty percent of the <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION>, the world's largest tropical rain
forest, lies in <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>, but the forest also covers parts of eight
surrounding countries.
   <PERSON>Lovejoy</PERSON> was one of the organizers of an unusual workshop held in
mid-January in <LOCATION>Manaus</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>, a sprawling city of 1 million people
in the heart of the <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION>. It was the center of <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>'s
once-thriving rubber trade.
   The workshop, which brought together all the governments and
scientists with interests in the rain forest, culminated with a
plan to regulate development in up to <PERCENT>80 percent</PERCENT> of the <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION>
region.
   It was the first time that all parties concerned with the <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION>
had met to pool their knowledge and agree on conservation
priorities, the meeting's participants said.
   The plan devised at the workshop has no legal force. But it has
broad government support and is likely to serve as a guide for
national conservation programs, participants said.
   Many of the areas to be preserved will be open to so-called
multiple-use development, which preserves the forest while allowing
tourism and the commercial exploitation of fibers, fruits and
medicinal plants.
   <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>, struggling with a teetering economy and pressured by
developers and peasant farmers to clear the forest for cattle
ranching or farming, has been ambivalent about the need to conserve
the <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION>.
   <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> participated in the <LOCATION>Manaus</LOCATION> workshop, however, and the
setting of priorities was ``all done with the blessing of <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>,''
<PERSON>Lovejoy</PERSON> said.
   Tropical rain forests are giant, living warehouses for thousands
of plant and animal species. The <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> alone is home to <PERCENT>30 percent</PERCENT>
of the world's plant and animal species.
   One study found that a single square yard of leaf litter taken
from the deep shadows of the <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> floor contained 800 ants
representing 50 species.
   Towering forest canopies up to 300 feet above the forest floor
are home to countless birds and insects that live their lives
without ever setting foot on the ground. One group of orchid
species grows only near the top of the canopy; an entirely
different collection of orchids grows at the bottom.
   At the <LOCATION>Manaus</LOCATION> meeting, more than 100 specialists met in small
groups to assess conservation priorities.
   Insect specialists compared data on such creatures as the
stinging ant that defends acacia trees against predators.
Mammologists took inventory of the <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION>'s screeching monkeys.
Ichthyologists considered such oddities as the fish that eats
fallen fruits and nuts on the <LOCATION>Amazon River</LOCATION>'s banks when it
overflows. Botanists, ornithologists and others did the same.
   Then they pooled their information and marked up maps of the
<LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION>. When they were done, the areas determined to be worth
saving covered <PERCENT>70 percent</PERCENT> to <PERCENT>80 percent</PERCENT> of the <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION>.
   ``The bulk of the <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> is a biological priority; there's no
way of getting around that,'' said <PERSON>Russell Mittermeier</PERSON>, president
of <ORGANIZATION>Conservation International</ORGANIZATION> and an authority on endangered
monkeys.
   Mittermeier emphasized, however, that the plan set realistic
goals for the establishment of national parks and reserves, along
with multiple-use areas where some development could occur.
   It is not realistic to build a fence around <PERCENT>70 percent</PERCENT> to <PERCENT>80
percent</PERCENT> of the <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION>, he said. Only the most critical areas should
be placed off limits to development.
   ``Ten to <PERCENT>20 percent</PERCENT> of the entire <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> should be in protected
parks or preserves, ideally,'' he said. At present, <PERCENT>2 percent</PERCENT> of
the <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> is protected.
   <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> was not alone in its support for the conservation plan.
   ``The results of this meeting are a major contribution towards
the work that has got to be done,'' said <PERSON>Stanley Malone</PERSON>, director
of the <ORGANIZATION>Suriname Forest Service</ORGANIZATION>.

to develop a unified approach to management of the <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Malone</PERSON>
said. What the officials lacked, however, was a guide to which
areas most needed protection.
   That determination has now been made, based on the number of
different species a given area contained, and on how many of those
species were endemic, or unique, to the area.
   ``Now we'll have to see what develops from this,'' <PERSON>Mittermeier</PERSON>
said. A new Brazilian president, <ORGANIZATION>Fernando Collor de Mello</ORGANIZATION>, will be
inaugurated <DATE>March 15</DATE>, and with him will come a new Brazilian
environmental policy.
   Whether the policy will include support for the <LOCATION>Manaus</LOCATION> plan is
uncertain. ``As always, everything depends on key individuals,''
<PERSON>Mittermeier</PERSON> said.
   ``I'm basically always optimistic,'' he said. ``I feel sure that
we can develop appropriate solutions, although it may take a lot of
work.''

<LEADPARA>  SEVENTY-FIVE years ago, the San Diego Zoo collected animals the way the
Salvation Army collected junk.;    Sailors, passing through town, donated
bears after their cuddly mascots outgrew their ships. An alligator, which had
terrorized neighbors, was lassoed and dragged to the zoo. Rattlesnakes,
unearthed by construction workers, were regularly dropped off. Most of the
zoo's original residents had been abandoned after the city hosted the
1915-1916 Panama California International Exposition.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Those modest early days are being remembered and celebrated at the zoo,
which is observing its 75th anniversary with special events and new exhibits
throughout the year.;    The first of these, <LOCATION>Gorilla Tropics</LOCATION>, opened this
<DATE>weekend</DATE>. It's a 2.5-acre African rain forest habitat for six gorillas and more
than 200 birds.;    <DATE>Today</DATE>, the <LOCATION>San Diego Zoo</LOCATION> is among the best known and most
respected in the world. Living amid its lush canyons, mesas and gardens are
more than 3,500 animals and 7,000 plant species.;    Birthday animals; The zoo
houses some of the rarest species on earth. Many animals living there are
found nowhere else in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>. It also boasts the largest collection
of Chinese animals outside <LOCATION>China.</LOCATION>;    The zoo is welcoming even more rare
animals throughout the year as birthday presents fly in from the international
zoo community. In <DATE>January</DATE>, the zoo, which has more koalas than any zoo outside
<LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>, got four more from an Australian wildlife preserve. The zoo threw a
party for the huggable koalas, which are by far the zoo's favorite
attraction.;    "This is truly an exciting time for the zoo," said <PERSON>James
Dolan</PERSON>, the director of animal collections. "Some of the animals being sent to
us for our 75th birthday are so rare they are not exhibited in the <LOCATION>Western
Hemisphere</LOCATION>.";    Making their first North American appearance are Siberian
weasels from the <LOCATION>Leningrad Zoo</LOCATION>, Corsac foxes from the <LOCATION>Moscow Zoo</LOCATION>, and from
<LOCATION>Berlin</LOCATION> some shaggy-haired mountain dwellers called Mishmi takins. A takin
looks like a cross between a mountain goat and a moose.;    Not all the
animals on display will have a pulse.;    Memorial <DATE>Day weekend</DATE>, <DATE>May 25-27</DATE>, a
builder from <ORGANIZATION>LEGO Co.</ORGANIZATION> will use its famous building blocks to erect an
8-foot-tall gorilla. The ape will stick around for a month.;    Meanwhile,
animal-shaped plants have sprouted recently throughout the zoo's 100 acres.
Hoping to become one of the premier spots for topiaries, the zoo's
horticulturists have been sculpting leafy flamingos, gorillas, koalas,
giraffes and other creatures.;    During its anniversary, the zoo will
continue to look less and less like a zoo. Since the mid-1980s, the zoo has
undergone major renovations to make it look wild enough to please tigers,
bears, alligators and the rest of the menagerie. The master plan directs that
the zoo be divided into areas where birds, mammals, reptiles and plants from
the same climatic zones live together. The old notion of grouping only the
same species together is considered passe.;    Three such realistic exhibits
have been completed so far. The zoo has recreated two rain forests and an
African kopje (pronounced COPY), an outcropping of volcanic rock that juts up
from the plains. The creation of a tundra, a grasslands, a desert, a savanna
and other climatic zones are planned into the <DATE>21st century</DATE> as funds permit.;  
 Simulated rain forest; Visitors will be able to see the <MONEY>$11.5 million</MONEY> <ORGANIZATION>Gorilla
Tropics</ORGANIZATION> exhibit from a suspension that spans a waterfall. The apes will roam
past pools and waterfalls through a forest of fig and sausage trees,
wildflowers and African grasses. There will be outcroppings and fallen trees
for gorillas to climb on.;    Many of the birds that will fly through gorilla
country are rarely seen in zoos. The flock includes snowy-headed robinchats,
African pygmy geese, blue-naped mousebirds and emerald starlings.;    In case
the gorillas or their visitors aren't convinced they're in a jungle, the
sounds of an African rain forest will play through hidden speakers.;    Zoo
officials hope the gorillas behave better than the sun bears did <DATE>two years ago</DATE>
when they were moved into their multimillion-dollar rain forest. The bears,
which formed bear pyramids to scale the walls and escape, quickly trashed the
place. They destroyed the sod, stripped the trees of their bark and even
ripped apart an artificial tree that contained a honey feeder in it.;    For
visitors who want to get close enough to pet the animals, there is always the
Children's Zoo. In the kiddie corral, goats, sheep and two homely pot-bellied
pig brothers named <PERSON>Huey</PERSON> and <PERSON>Duey</PERSON> tolerate rambunctious toddlers.;    Why are
the animals so mellow?;    "It's their job," said one zoo keeper watching her
flock. "They really have a pretty easy life. Not much is expected of them.";  
 Zoo officials hope that <DATE>1991</DATE> -- with all the extra festivities -- will be one
of their biggest years ever for attendance. They aren't sure, however, if the
turmoil in the <LOCATION>Persian Gulf</LOCATION>, which has been discouraging people from traveling
long distances, will result in bigger or smaller crowds.;    "It could go
either way," said <PERSON>Georgeanne Irvine</PERSON>, a zoo spokeswoman. "I personally think
people will need a little relief and will come to the zoo to escape.";     IF
YOU'RE INTERESTED; The zoo's actual birthday is <DATE>Oct. 2</DATE>. Throughout <DATE>October</DATE>,
children under 15 years will be admitted free. And on <DATE>Oct. 7</DATE>, no one will be
charged.;    Regular admission is <MONEY>$10.75</MONEY> for adults, <MONEY>$4</MONEY> for children 3 to 15
and free for those 2 and under. The zoo, in the city's famous <LOCATION>Balboa Park</LOCATION>, is
open daily from <TIME>9 a.m.</TIME> to <TIME>5 p.m.</TIME>  </TEXT>

FT  24 SEP 94 / Back to our African Roots: The Nature of Things
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lucy has lost her title as our oldest known ancestor. In her place are the
Root family, who lived 4.4m years ago on the wooded highlands of east
<LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>.
Some of this week's publicity about the discovery of 17 Root fossils in
<LOCATION>Ethiopia</LOCATION> suggested that they were the long-sought 'missing link'.
In fact they are not quite old enough to represent the putative ancestor of
apes and humans; the evolutionary split between the two classes of primates
is believed to have occurred at least 5m years ago.
Even so, the anthropologists who discovered the new hominid species -
officially named Australopithecus ramidus after the local Afar word 'ramid',
meaning root - have given the study of human evolution its biggest boost
since the 3.2m-year-old remains of Lucy (Australopithecus afarensis) were
found in the same area in <DATE>1978</DATE>.
Most of the Root fossils found so far are teeth and small fragments of bone,
which had been chewed up and scattered around the <LOCATION>Awash River</LOCATION> site by
scavenging animals. There is nothing to match the relatively complete
skeletons of <PERSON>Lucy</PERSON> and her contemporary known as 'Son of Lucy'.
The researchers - <PERSON>Tim White</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>University of California</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Berkeley</LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION>Gen
Suwa of Tokyo University</ORGANIZATION>; and <PERSON>Berhane Asfaw</PERSON> of the Ethiopian
Palaeonthropology Laboratory - have found pieces of skull and arm bones, but
unfortunately no remains of hips, legs or feet. Without them, it is
impossible to tell whether the Roots walked on two legs or four - or a bit
of both.
So the latest discovery takes us no closer to knowing when our ancestors
came down from the trees and started walking upright. But there is a good
chance that the anthropologists will soon turn up some bones from below the
waist as they continue to scour the research site.
What the fossils already tell us is that our ancestors 4.4m years ago were
about the same size as the smallest contemporary forms of chimpanzee, or
half as big as us. They had ape-sized heads and, presumably, ape-like mental
abilities.
Most of the technical analysis in this week's Nature paper describing A.
ramidus as a new hominid species concerns its teeth, partly because these
are the most plentiful remains and partly because dental evidence is
conventionally important for primate taxonomy.
The Roots' teeth are smaller than those of later Australopithecus species
such as Lucy, though larger than modern human or chimp teeth. Their dental
details are mainly intermediate between apes and the later hominids, as you
would expect, though there are also some special features such as
distinctive diamond-shaped canine teeth.
A battery of geological and radio-isotope dating procedures - carried out on
the hominid bones, other fossilised animal and plant remains, and the rocks
around them - all point to a narrow age range between 4.3m to 4.5m years for
the find.
The evidence from the other fossils shows that the Awash site, now an arid
semi-desert, was lush woodland when the Roots lived there. The researchers
found thousands of fossilised seeds of forest trees and plentiful bones of
tree-dwelling colobus monkeys.
Although the proven facts about A. ramidus are very sparse, they can be
combined with what is known about later hominids and modern apes, to give a
reasonable speculative view of the Roots' lifestyle.
They slept high up in the trees, for safety, and spent a lot of their waking
life there too, eating leaves and fruit. Their strong arms and hands enabled
them to swing through the branches, though with less speed and agility than
a chimp.
Sometimes, however, the Roots came down to the ground, to eat fallen fruit
and to supplement their largely vegetarian diet by scavenging dead animals.
They may even have banded together occasionally to hunt and kill animals.
These hairy hominids probably did walk upright, at least for part of the
time, but with a waddle that would have looked very different from today's
human gait.
If the Roots had ape-like minds, they may have picked up sticks and stones
to use as primitive tools, for example to pick juicy insects out of crevices
in tree trunks or smash open nuts.
But they were not clever enough to fashion tools of their own by cutting
sticks and stones into more useful shapes.
We shall have to wait for the fossil hunters to find more extensive remains
of the Roots to know how accurate this picture is and give some idea about
their social structure.
If the females turn out to be much smaller than the males - as was the case
with <PERSON>Lucy</PERSON> and her menfolk - then it would be reasonable to conclude that
dominant males competed for control of family groups.
For now, the significance of the discovery is its confirmation of the view
originally put forward by <PERSON>Charles Darwin</PERSON>, that the roots of human evolution
would lie in <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>.

<LEADPARA>  ENVIRONMENTAL HEROISM on six continents was celebrated Monday with the
presentation of the second annual Goldman Environmental Prizes, which seem
destined to become the Nobels of save-the-planet activism.;    Founded by San

leaders of 57 nations, including President Bush, the prize honors those who
fight enormous odds -- and sometimes the very heads of state who have endorsed
the prize -- to protect the environment.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     <PERSON>Richard Goldman</PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION>Richard N. Goldman
&amp; Co.</ORGANIZATION>, a major independent insurance brokerage firm, said the prize was
designed to acknowledge "ordinary people doing extraordinary things." He said
it is "based on the premise that individuals can make a difference.";    This
year's winners, who were introduced at a <TIME>morning</TIME> news conference at the <ORGANIZATION>Clift
Hotel</ORGANIZATION>, range from a Swedish schoolboy to a Peruvian jungle tribesman to a <LOCATION>San
Francisco</LOCATION> biologist with a passion for dolphins.;    Each winner, except the
schoolboy, who shares his prize with a former teacher, will receive <MONEY>$60,000</MONEY>.;
<LOCATION>AFRICA</LOCATION>: GREEN BELT; 10 million trees; planted in <LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION>;  <PERSON>Wangari Maathai</PERSON> was
the first woman from <LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION> to earn a doctorate, but the work for which she was
honored <DATE>Monday</DATE> was not academic. It began with the simple planting of a tree.;
   <LOCATION>Maathai</LOCATION>, 51, is founder of <LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Green Belt Movement</ORGANIZATION>, a tree-planting
project aimed at curtailing the effects of logging practices that cleared all
but <PERCENT>3 percent</PERCENT> of her nation's timberlands.;    Employing 50,000 people, mostly
women, the program is credited with planting 10 million trees across the
Kenyan countryside. The movement is so successful that it is being copied in
more than a dozen African nations.;    In <DATE>1989</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Maathai</ORGANIZATION>'s commitment to the
environment put her in opposition to plans for a 60-story skyscraper -- billed
as the tallest on the African continent -- in the middle of a park that is
downtown <LOCATION>Nairobi</LOCATION>'s most important public open space. So incensed was the
government that officials labeled her and her movement "subversive" and
threatened her with deportation.;    <ORGANIZATION>Maathai</ORGANIZATION> persisted, and international
publicity caused foreign investors to withdraw support for the skyscraper,
which has been drastically scaled down and still has not been built.;    On
<DATE>Monday</DATE>, <PERSON>Maathai</PERSON> seemed amazed at being labeled a subversive. "As if planting a
tree is an activity that can overthrow any government," she said.; ASIA: RAIN
FORESTS;  Warning: Logging; is bad for <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>;  <PERSON>Yoichi Kuroda</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> was
rewarded, in effect, for warning his compatriots of the consequences of their
rapacious appetite for tropical hardwood.;    During the past 20 years,
logging by Japanese interests has destroyed most of the forests of <LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION>
and the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION>, and now threatens <LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION>'s.;    The international
environmental community long has linked tropical deforestation to such
calamities as drought, floods and economic upheavals, but it is a book that
<PERSON>Kuroda</PERSON> co-authored that is credited with presenting those connections to the
Japanese public.;    In addition to writing "Timber From the South Seas: An
Analysis of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Tropical Timber Trade</ORGANIZATION> and its Environmental Impact,"
37-year-old <PERSON>Kuroda</PERSON> led demonstrations to pressure Japanese government and
corporate leaders to change their policies.;    <PERSON>Kuroda</PERSON> said <DATE>Monday</DATE> that it is
too early to estimate how much his efforts will reduce timber imports. But he
indicated that he will not be satisfied until rain forest logging ends.;
<LOCATION>ANTARCTICA</LOCATION>: MINING; Author urges <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> to stop digging;  <PERSON>Catherine Ceinwen
Wallace</PERSON> of <LOCATION>New Zealand</LOCATION> used her trip to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> to pick up her prize
as an opportunity to criticize one of her major foes -- the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> government.; 
  <PERSON>Wallace</PERSON>, 39, an author and university lecturer in economics, is pushing for
a ban on mining in the Antarctic, despite opposition primarily from the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>
administration.;    <PERSON>Wallace</PERSON>, a leader in a movement that includes 200
organizations in 40 countries, cites the <ORGANIZATION>Exxon Valdez</ORGANIZATION> disaster as an example
of what can happen when oil and other riches are extracted from pristine
environments.;    "Anything you could dig out of the ground has far less value
than other treasures of the Antarctic," she said.; <LOCATION>EUROPE</LOCATION>: KIDS' FUND; How a
schoolboy; saved a rain forest;  "It's not easy to be a teacher sometimes,"
said <PERSON>Eha Kern</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION>. "Children ask so many questions.";    One student who
asked a lot of questions was <PERSON>Roland Tiensuu</PERSON>, now 12, who in <DATE>1987</DATE> was so moved
by <PERSON>Kern</PERSON>'s descriptions of tropical rain forests that he organized his
classmates to raise money to save some of the trees and animals.;    A bake
sale raised enough money for <LOCATION>Costa Rica</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Monteverde Conservation League</ORGANIZATION> to
buy a few acres of rain forest in the spectacular <ORGANIZATION>Monteverde Reserve</ORGANIZATION>.
Heartened by success and guided by <PERSON>Kerns</PERSON>, the students expanded their efforts.
Now, more than 4,000 Swedish schools have joined to raise <MONEY>$1.5 million</MONEY>, enough
to buy more than 17,000 acres.;    In appreciation, the conservation league
has named that section of the reserve "Bosque Eterno d los Ninos" -- The
Children's Eternal Forest.; <LOCATION>S. AMERICA</LOCATION>: INDIAN LAND; Native tribes; get a
champion;  With his brightly colored hat and feathered earring, <PERSON>Evaristo
Nugkuag</PERSON> looks like what he is -- a member of the Aguaruna tribe of <LOCATION>Peru</LOCATION>'s
<LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> basin.;    But while very much part of his tribe, Nugkuag is educated
in the ways of the larger world and has used that knowledge to help protect
his people. He has persuaded Indians throughout the <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> regions of <LOCATION>Peru</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Bolivia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ecuador</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Colombia</LOCATION> to join in a coalition that now lobbies
on behalf of 1.2 million indigenous people.;    The Indians have reached out
for international support in the battle against encroachment by ranchers,
miners and developers, arguing that indigenous people are part of the natural
environment of the <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> and should be allowed to remain there as stewards of
the land.;    "The forest is not a resource for us -- it is life itself,"
<PERSON>Nugkuag</PERSON> said through an interpreter. "It is the only place for us to live.";
<LOCATION>N. AMERICA</LOCATION>: DOLPHINS; A video changes the tuna industry; <PERSON>Sam LaBudde</PERSON> of <LOCATION>San
Francisco</LOCATION> was the only prize winner honored for undercover work.;    From
<DATE>October 1987</DATE> to <DATE>January 1988</DATE>, LaBudde hired out as a deck hand and cook on a
Mexican fishing boat so he could surreptitiously videotape the slaughter of
hundreds of dolphins trapped in tuna nets.;    His tape, the first filmed
evidence that fishing crews were killing large numbers of dolphins in the
pursuit of tuna, was broadcast widely throughout the world and led to a
boycott that forced major canneries to stop buying tuna caught in ways that
kill dolphins.;    LaBudde, 34, said he would donate the <MONEY>$60,000</MONEY> to the <ORGANIZATION>Earth
Island Institute</ORGANIZATION> to save endangered species.;    But LaBudde is not
optimistic. Citing estimates that 10,000 species will become extinct in the
next 10 years, he said that despite such efforts as his own, "the likelihood
is there's not a damn thing we can do about it."  </TEXT>

<TEXT>
   <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>'s first Public Orchid Space opened this week in the <LOCATION>Bronx</LOCATION> -- the borough that nurtures, along with the Yankees and urban blight, this city's only tropical rain forest. 
With the <ORGANIZATION>Thekla E. Johnson Rotunda</ORGANIZATION> and Orchid Terrarium -- a <MONEY>million-dollar</MONEY> and 750-orchid gift from publisher <PERSON>Walter J. Johnson</PERSON> (and offspring) in memory of his wife -- in situ central at the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> Botanical Garden's Museum Building, the borough now has a secure, year-round orchid-viewing habitat. 

   Orchids are profoundly sexy, an observation that caused <PERSON>Charles Darwin</PERSON> to write a 366-page book, "On the Various Contrivances by Which British and Foreign Orchids Are Fertilised by Insects, and on the Good Effects of Intercrossing." 
Their often ostentatious, complex beauty is thoroughly, deceitfully utilitarian. 
In the course of co-evolution, orchids have contrived the floral likenesses of bees, spiders, wasps and flies among others, to the sexual cuckolding of those animals -- and the orchids' own pollination satisfaction. 

   Orchids also have seduced people, among them the late <PERSON>Thekla Johnson</PERSON>, a longtime member of the Working Gardeners of <LOCATION>Bronxville</LOCATION> (<LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>). 
She was "an orchid fanatic" recalls <PERSON>Stefan Wilgermein</PERSON>, a retired senior gardener at <ORGANIZATION>NYBG</ORGANIZATION>, who worked 15 years with her orchids. 
"They were her babies. 
Once the cymbidiums got a virus and some had to be destroyed. 
I think she cried the whole night." 

   <PERSON>Mr. Wilgermein</PERSON> remembers that <PERSON>Thekla Johnson</PERSON> "paid special attention to the phalaenopsis," the demurely showy Southeast Asian moth orchids. 
Now she is one. 
"Phalaenopsis" <PERSON>Memoria Thekla E. Johnson</PERSON>, a white hybrid commissioned and named by the <ORGANIZATION>Greater New York Orchid Society</ORGANIZATION>, arrived here <DATE>Friday</DATE> from <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>. 

   It is impossible to get involved with just one orchid, as <PERSON>Mrs. Johnson</PERSON> learned, given an extended family that runs to upward of 25,000 species. 
Her namesake 176-cubic-foot orchid terrarium -- in the Victorian Temple of Love style -- can accommodate a mere scintilla, one-one-thousandth of the world's wild orchids, with again as many, maybe .00025 of the 100,000 already properly registered, named hybrids. 

   Not to worry. 
<PERSON>Keith Lloyd</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>NYBG</ORGANIZATION>'s curator of orchids, is in charge of orchid rotation into the <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> terrarium, a vast bloom-dependent editing job, considering the 5,500 orchids in the garden's collection. 
<PERSON>Mr. Lloyd</PERSON> promises that the rotundal orchidarium will be "filled to aesthetic capacity, but not limited to the largest, the most colorful, or the prettiest. 
The unusual species will have equal place with the showy and large hybrids." 

   To this end the opening exhibition includes a number of wild minis that, due to the problem of orchid larceny, have not heretofore faced the public. (Orchids have long aroused the acquisitive urge. 
Back in the <DATE>19th century</DATE>, as European imperialism expanded through <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Americas</LOCATION>, horticultural imperialism did too. 
Orchid hunters carried out the collective rape of wild orchids by the hundreds of thousands.) 
Bring your opera glasses and you can discern the intricate, quarter-inch orange blooms of a wild lepanthes, a minute epiphyte from the <LOCATION>Dominican Republic</LOCATION> making its <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> debut. 

   "The garden's charter," says <PERSON>Mr. Lloyd</PERSON>, "states that the collections are for scientific research and the entertainment of the people. 
The species satisfy the scientific aspect, the large showy hybrids, the entertainment." 
And so you see the hybrid progression from the flamboyantly entertaining "Cattleyas" <PERSON>Lucie Hauserman</PERSON> and Tango through the souped-up extravagance of "Laeliocattleya" 'Pink Lady' to "Brassolaeliocattleya" Gold Country 'Fine Gold,' a Liberace of an orchid. (One fully expects a "Brassolaeliocattleya" 'Trump's Gold.') 

   From <PERSON>Thekla Johnson</PERSON>'s collection comes the endangered Andean species "Odontoglossum warmingii." 
<PERSON>Mr. Wilgermein</PERSON> remembers that <PERSON>Mrs. Johnson</PERSON> was very fond of the odontoglossums, saying "they look like laughing faces." 
Also fond of them were the deadly competitive orchid hunters, who worked like strip miners, in the employ of <ORGANIZATION>Queen Victoria</ORGANIZATION>'s own <ORGANIZATION>Royal Orchid Grower</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Frederick Sander</PERSON>, and <PERSON>James Veitch</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>Royal Exotic Nursery</ORGANIZATION>. 
During the savage heyday of Victorian orchidomania, <PERSON>Albert Millican</PERSON> blithely recounted in "Travels and Adventures of an Orchid Hunter" (1891) how he armed 30 Colombian "natives" with axes and set them to "cutting down all trees containing valuable orchids {odontoglossums}. 
After about two months' work we had secured about 10,000 plants, cutting down to obtain these some 4,000 trees . . ." 

   Three Southeast Asian orchids from the <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> collection, two "Paphiopedilum charlesworthii" and one "P. goultenianum," terrestrial slippers with waxy, embalmed-looking flowers, are out of preventive detention, too, thanks to the new terrarium. (Near relatives, the very tenuous and on paper protected "Paphs rothschildianum" and "sanderianum," from <LOCATION>Borneo</LOCATION>, are the object of continuing, devastating orchid cupidity. 
A couple of years ago one European orchid rustler helicoptered out hundreds of these rarities, smuggled them into <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> and sold them for <MONEY>$1,000</MONEY> to <MONEY>$2,000</MONEY> per plant.) 

   The point of the <ORGANIZATION>American Orchid Society</ORGANIZATION>'s campaign "to remove the mystique . . . that the wild orchid is better or more perfect than the man-made one" is made by the wild fairy slipper "Paphiopedilum fairrieanum," potted next to its pixillated man-made progeny "Paphiopedilum" 'Elfin Charm.' 

   Also in the round are softly zaftig phalaenopsis dandling their "keikis," baby plants with roots and leaves, offset on flowering spikes. 
One can take in the "Phalaenopsis lueddemanniana var. 'hieroglyphica,'" with as yet undeciphered Egyptian hieroglyphics on every segment of every flower. 

   With the orchids in the terrarium, plus the thousands of backup plants benched to bloom in the garden's propagation range, there are now likely more orchids in 250 acres of the <LOCATION>Bronx</LOCATION> than in many once-orchidaceous areas of the same size whence the <PERSON>Bronxites</PERSON>' ancestors came. 
There -- in <LOCATION>Papua New Guinea</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Madagascar</LOCATION>, the Brazilian, Peruvian and <ORGANIZATION>Ecuadorian Amazon</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Guatemala</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Costa Rica</LOCATION> -- the rain forests are being destroyed at a rate of 50 acres a minute.

<HEAD>Birds of Prey Research Leads To Forest Preservation Work</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   From the Great Seal of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> to
the folklore of Native Americans, birds of prey have been powerful
symbols of freedom, dignity and strength.
   But eagles, hawks and other raptors also send another message.
Because of their position near the top of the food chain, they serve
as environmental monitors, warning of impending danger like canaries
in a coal mine.
   ``If we see things happening to these birds ... that signals us
that there are more severe problems lower down in the food chain,''
said <PERSON>Tom Cade</PERSON>, who founded the Peregrine Fund in <DATE>1970</DATE> while a
professor at <ORGANIZATION>Cornell University</ORGANIZATION>.
   Peregrine Fund researchers and volunteers, who helped bring the
species back from near extinction, now are applying what they
learned to the study and preservation of raptors _ predatory birds
distinguished by talons, hooked beaks and keen eyesight _ from the
jungles of <LOCATION>Guatemala</LOCATION> to the plains of <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>.
   At the <ORGANIZATION>World Center for Birds</ORGANIZATION> of Prey in the southwestern <LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION>
desert, researchers breed tropical raptors in captivity for release
in the wild. Others are in the field, collecting data on the birds
in their native habitat.
   Their work has led them into the battle to preserve tropical rain
forests that are home to half the world's plant and animal species
and are disappearing at the rate of 50 acres a minutes, said <PERSON>Bill
Burnham</PERSON>, the center's director.
   ``Many of the nations are beginning to see their environments as
their futures,'' <PERSON>Burnham</PERSON> said. ``If you eliminate your natural
resources, if you cut down all your forests, your children and your
grandchildren won't have much to look forward to.''
   The impact of the rain forests reaches far beyond the boundaries
of the nations they cover; many songbirds, waterfowl and raptors
considered indigenous to <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION> actually spend much of their
time in the tropics.
   ``Wildlife do not recognize political boundaries,'' <PERSON>Burnham</PERSON> said.
``You can't be provincial and manage a highly migratory species.''
   Little is known about many of the tropical raptors, and ``there
is no way to know how to preserve them if you know nothing about
them,'' he said.
   In its ``Maya Project'' in <LOCATION>Guatemala</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Belize</LOCATION>, the Peregrine
Fund is studying raptors in both pristine and altered forests to see
how the birds adapt to changes in their environment. It also is
trying to determine where the birds live in the forests and how much
territory they need to survive and breed _ information that later
can be used in establishing wildlife preserves.
   For example, the harpy eagle, thought to be the most powerful
eagle in the world, may require 5,000 acres or more for each pair,
<PERSON>Cade</PERSON> said.
   Studying the birds first required finding them in the dense,
mosquito-infested jungles. From perches atop trees and ancient Mayan
temples, researchers were able to observe some birds flying above
the forest canopy. Other species were lured with taped calls. The
team has detected 26 raptor species in the two Central American
nations.
   Working with peregrines not only gave the group a scientific
background that can be applied to other raptors, but it also helped
them develop skills needed to work with other people, <PERSON>Burnham</PERSON> said.
``Cooperation is the key word. We are not a confrontational
organization. We are a conservation organization that works together
with other groups.''
   Among those cooperating on the <ORGANIZATION>Maya Project</ORGANIZATION> are <LOCATION>Guatemala</LOCATION>'s
<ORGANIZATION>Institute of Anthropology</ORGANIZATION> and History and the <ORGANIZATION>Belize Department of
Agriculture</ORGANIZATION>.
   Though prospects of saving tropical raptors seem daunting, the
Peregrine Fund can take heart from past success when the odds were
against them.
   Because of the effects of the pesticide DDT, peregrine falcons,
once common in much of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, had been had reduced to 35
pairs by <DATE>1975</DATE>, and none remained east of the <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION>. Largely
through the efforts of the fund, there now are more than 600 falcons
in 25 states. The group's goal is to have the birds removed from the
endangered species list by the turn of the century.
   ``It's gone a long way further than I ever envisioned it back
when we started,'' <PERSON>Cade</PERSON> said.

<HEAD>PERINET, Madagascar: of wealth.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The government has shifted course from the policies adopted in a
<DATE>1975</DATE> socialist revolution and now follows the advice of Western
donors on economic policy. But a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> embassy economic report says
no economic reforms will work in the long run ``without corrective
action against <LOCATION>Madagascar</LOCATION>'s single greatest self-inflicted problem:
the destruction of its environment.''
   The government also has broken out of the virtual self-imposed
isolation since President <PERSON>Didier Ratsiraka</PERSON> came to power in <DATE>1975</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Nicoll</PERSON> says the government has cooperated with environmental
groups since the end of <DATE>1985</DATE>. ``It is our No. 1 conservation
priority,'' he says.
   A recent issue of the daily newspaper <PERSON>Midi</PERSON> said an average of 3.7
million acres of land was being burned each year. Midi, an
independent journal, likened the the burning to ``national
pyromania.''
   Some peasants reportedly continue to burn the land to show their
displeasure with the steady decline in the nation's economy since
the revolution. Per capita income declined <PERCENT>24 percent</PERCENT> between <DATE>1979</DATE>
and <DATE>1983</DATE>.
   The denuded hillsides are no match for heavy rains and occasional
cyclones. Great holes are carved in the landscape by erosion. The
Indian Ocean north of the island is red from the red clay soil
washed out to sea.
   The <ORGANIZATION>World Bank</ORGANIZATION> is organizing an international effort to halt the
degradation, which it estimates will cost from <MONEY>$300 million</MONEY> to <MONEY>$400
million</MONEY> over the <DATE>next 15</DATE> to 20 years.
   Already 11 major projects aided by Western environmental groups,
universities and governments are under way. They include efforts to
save existing reserves and plans to create new reserves or national
parks.
   <PERSON>Nicoll</PERSON>, whose <ORGANIZATION>WWF</ORGANIZATION> is managing projects covering 10 reserves, says
efforts have to take into consideration the needs of the people who
live nearby.
   ``The people don't want to cut down the forest just because it's
there,'' says <ORGANIZATION>Yale University</ORGANIZATION> anthropologist <PERSON>Elearnor Sterling</PERSON>, who
is studying the aye-aye. ``They truly need the wood for firewood or
for land for agriculture. Many of them understand the problems in
the environment and would like to do something to help but they have
to feed their children.''
   <PERSON>Nicoll</PERSON> says the success of the Perinet reserve proves people can
be persuaded to change.
   ``I was there in <DATE>1985</DATE>, during my first long-term stay in
<LOCATION>Madagascar</LOCATION>,'' he says. ``When you'd go into the reserve you'd meet
people walking along with an ax. Just about every day you'd hear the
chop, chop of an ax. You never hear that now. Tourism has done that.
Tourism has put that place into a sort of protected status. Nobody
would dare go in there now with an ax.''
   Western organizations are pushing tourism, which up to now only
brings a few thousand people to the island, many of them bird
watchers or naturalists.
   Ambassador <PERSON>Lynch</PERSON>, whose government is a major backer of
conservation projects, says, ``I think we're on the right track but
time is passing very quickly and the forests are burning fast.''
