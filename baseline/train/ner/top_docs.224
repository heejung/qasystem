  [Abstract] Power lasers with widely variable 
characteristics have been built to serve as high-energy 
hyperdirectional radiation sources, as sources of luminous 
energy to be transmitted over long distances with minimum loss 
and to be received with subdiffractional precision. One of the 
largest research stands built at the <ORGANIZATION>Institute of Optics</ORGANIZATION> during 
the past 15 years is the 6-channel ``Progress,'' intended for 
the study of intense radiation and spherical target interaction 
relating to laser-induced thermonuclear fusion. It includes a 
Nd-glass master laser emitting pulses of up to 1.5 kJ energy and 
about 1 ns duration or a power of 3.5 <ORGANIZATION>TW</ORGANIZATION> in pulses of 0.1 ns 
duration. It also includes a chirp-pulse generator with a 
regenerative amplifier and a shaping-pulse generator, both 
feeding a common preamplifier with two inputs and three outputs. 
Pulses from one output pass through a compressor to the target 
inside a spherical chamber. Pulses from the other two outputs 
pass through a separator to a module which contains: a series of 
bar and disk amplifiers with successively larger (30 mm to 110 
mm) apertures with vacuum-type spatial filters separating the 
amplifiers and preventing self-action, electrooptical 
deflectors, electrooptical (Pockels) shutters and magnetooptical 
(<LOCATION>Faraday</LOCATION>) shutters decoupling the laser from targets, and 
harmonic filters. From here pulses proceed along six channels to 
six targets. Some pulses are deflected through an amplifier with 
a 140 mm aperture to two detectors with 150 mm and 250 mm 
apertures respectively. Some pulses are diverted to another 
compressor. This stand was used in experiments with pulse 
compression during stimulated Mandelshtam-Brillouin scattering. 
For generating and amplifying ultrashort chirp pulses of only 1 
mJ energy and 0.2-1.0 ns within a 2-4 nm spectral, a very 
inefficient Nd-glass laser is replaced with a mode-locked 
YAG:Nd[.sup]+3[/] laser emitting continuous sequences of 
pulses of 50 ps duration at a repetition rate of 100 MHz within 
a 0.2 nm wide spectral band. Chirp pulses of 0.15-0.6 ns 
duration are formed in single-mode fiber optics, where phase 
modulation and group velocity dispersion broaden the spectrum 
and elongate a pulse. Additional elongation of a pulse takes 
place in a lattice-type stretcher. Extraction of a pulse is 
effected by the electrooptical shutters, which are controlled by 
photoelectric switches. The regenerative amplifier then puts out 
a pulse of about 1 mJ energy, sufficient for transmission to the 
main amplifier channel with a 110 mm exit aperture. A second 
large research stand is the ``LAS'', which includes an Nd-glass 
laser with phase conjugation and a 110 mm output aperture. It 
emits pulses of up to 500 J and 25 ns duration in a beam with a 
divergence angle of 5 ?rad so that the axial radiation 
intensity reaches 80 aW/cm[.sup]2[/]. A third large research 
stand is the ``Chibis'', which includes a CO[.sub]2[/]-laser 
operation in the pulse-repetition mode. Experiments with this 
apparatus have demonstrated the feasibility of a 
focusing-deflecting system which uses large compound mirrors and 
of compensating its aberrations by means of phase conjugation.

  [Abstract] Experimental results are presented from studies 
of spectral and temporal characteristics of chromium and 
neodymium ion laser radiation in various media. The author 
obtained the results in a number of experiments using one 
experimental setup and identical conditions. This was done to 
eliminate the effect of technical perturbations of the 
resonator. The qualitative difference in the behavior of the 
free generation of chromium and neodymium ions suggests a 
physical mechanism which causes nonattenuating radiation 
pulsations in lasers using ions with an external working shell 
linked with the spallation of the working levels of the ions in 
their own radiation field. It is unambiguously found that 
chromium ion lasers, in contrast to neodymium ion lasers, have a 
distinct physical mechanism which causes nonattenuating 
pulsation of radiation intensity. Any mechanism associated with 
spatial interaction of modes in the active medium is ruled out. 
The difference in the lasers is ascribed to the great difference 
in the structure of the ions' working levels. The electric field 
of the laser radiation which arises in the active medium will 
affect only chromium ions, leading to further spallation of the 
working levels due to the dynamic Stark effect. When the field 
in the active medium is spatially inhomogeneous, a standing wave 
is formed whose spatial structure is altered during generation. 
The Stark effect leads to modulation of intensity over time and 
nonattenuating pulsations in intensity. When the spatial 
inhomogeneity of the field in the active medium is smoothed, 
this intensity modulation disappears. This conclusion was 
verified experimentally using titanium lasers. It may also be 
concluded that free generation of all rare earth ions in various 
media should occur in quasi-stationary mode without the need to 
smooth the spatial inhomogeneity of the field in the active 
medium. Figures 6; references 44, 33 Russian, 11 Western.

   They find things in the dark. They check
groceries, play concertos and perform eye surgery. They are faster
than a speeding bullet and could do serious damage to a locomotive.
   Lasers have been the Superman of the electromagnetic spectrum
ever since <DATE>1960</DATE>, when 33-year-old <PERSON>Theodore H. Maiman</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Hughes
Aircraft Co.</ORGANIZATION> built the first one from a pink ruby.
   As they near their 30th anniversary, though, lasers have switched
from comic-book novelties to necessities that preoccupy the
technology giants of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>.
   Lasers are not only in compact disc players and bar-code scanners
at checkout counters, they are in the phone system, carrying
long-distance calls over hair-thin glass fibers.
   Now, lasers are poised to take a quantum leap. Tiny devices
called quantum lasers herald an era in which lasers will be more
central to the technology underlying daily life.
   Experts say quantum lasers and their cousins, quantum
transistors, could make possible supercomputers the size of
baseballs, and television screens of unparalleled clarity that hang
on the wall like a painting.
   ``Quantum devices are the wave of the future. Almost all of the
research that goes on involves quantum effects in some way or
another,'' said <PERSON>David V. Lang</PERSON>, director of the solid state
electronics research lab at <ORGANIZATION>AT&amp;T Bell Labs</ORGANIZATION>.
   Lasers are what some scientists call a ``killer'' technology:
Compact discs are killing vinyl records, for example, and nobody
uses copper anymore for long-distance phone lines.
   To repeat a familiar story, the Japanese are putting the
American-invented killer to use more effectively than Americans
themselves are.
   <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s dominance of mass-market electronics gives its companies
unmatched expertise in making things small, cheap and reliable. For
example, Japanese companies dominate the market for CD players,
which use more lasers than any other product.
   ``It's a byproduct of the Japanese decision to invest in consumer
electronics. They'll find an application and find the technology to
solve it. I wish we did it here,'' said <PERSON>Henry Kressel</PERSON>, a venture
capitalist at <ORGANIZATION>E.M. Warburg Pincus &amp; Co</ORGANIZATION>. Inc. in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>.
   <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s twin towers of strength in lasers and semiconductors
could allow it to build the first computers in which chips are
connected by quantum laser beams instead of electricity. That
worries companies like <ORGANIZATION>International Business Machines Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, which
is intensively studying quantum well lasers and quantum well
transistors.
   At <ORGANIZATION>AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories</ORGANIZATION>, one of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s foremost laser
research centers, <PERSON>Alan Huang</PERSON> is hoping to leapfrog the Japanese. But
he admits the competition is tough: For an early model of his
``optical computer'' he had to use a diode laser he took from a
Japanese-made CD player.
   A laser is a directed needle of light purified to one particular
color, or wavelength. In contrast, ordinary light is a jumble of
many wavelengths flying in all directions.
   ``Laser'' stands for light amplification by stimulated emission
of radiation. In a cascading effect, photons of light strike an
energized material and stimulate the release of more photons in a
synchronized pattern.
   The most powerful lasers, big enough for someone to walk inside,
are being used to attempt to fuse the nuclei of atoms in flashes of
energy a million times more intense than a nuclear blast. Sustained
nuclear fusion could be a source of clean, plentiful and cheap
electricity.
   At the other end of the scale are semiconductor diode lasers, no
bigger than a grain of salt _ the kind used in compact disc players
and the phone system. One exotic subspecies is the quantum laser.
   Scientists build quantum lasers by ``spray-painting'' atoms in a
layer cake of incredibly thin layers, some of which have impurities
added.
   The impure layers act like walls to trap electrons. Confining so
many electrons and their receptors (``holes'') to a tiny space makes
it easier to get a cascade of photons going, creating laser light.
   If a laser the size of a salt crystal were blown up to the size
of the World Trade Center in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, a quantum well would be about
the thickness of a rug in an office, said <PERSON>Michael Ettenberg</PERSON>,
director of the optoelectronics research lab at the <ORGANIZATION>David Sarnoff
Research Center</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Princeton</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>
   Quantum lasers are more precise and require less current, and
their efficiency in converting electricity to light is unmatched.
   Spectra Diode Laboratories of <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, recently produced
55 watts of continuous wave power from a quantum laser, a record
power output and power conversion efficiency for a semiconductor
laser, president and chief executive <PERSON>Donald Scifres</PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION>The
Associated Press</ORGANIZATION> this past week.
   Ophthalmic surgeons have used lasers since <DATE>1970</DATE> to weld detached
retinas. Later came other medical uses like excising tumors and
eliminating cataracts. Today, lasers snaked into the body on optical
fibers clean arteries and destroy urinary-tract stones.
   Lasers are used to make pinholes in the nipples of baby bottles,
study components of car exhaust and form the three-dimensional
holograms used on credit cards _ and maybe someday dollar bills.
   The military has ``Star Wars'' designs for free-electron lasers
and powerful X-ray lasers, which physicist <ORGANIZATION>Edward Teller</ORGANIZATION> has
suggested could be triggered by a nuclear blast.
   Laser weapons would most likely be mounted in space: ``People
tried to shoot laser beams through the sky and what they discovered
was fog and rain,'' said <ORGANIZATION>William Bridges of California Institute of
Technology</ORGANIZATION>.
   Quantum well lasers fill only one niche, but an important one.
Their speed and efficiency makes them ideal for rapid-fire
communication, initially for long-distance calls, later for links
between neighboring computers and eventually for the links between
chips in computers, said <PERSON>Robert Melcher</PERSON>, a laser expert for <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Zurich</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Switzerland</LOCATION>.
   ``I've been in the laser game for 25 years now,'' said one
researcher, <PERSON>Ross A. McFarlane</PERSON>, of <ORGANIZATION>Hughes Research Laboratories</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Malibu</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION> ``That (quantum lasers) is where the future lies.''

   (During its centennial year, The Wall Street Journal will report events of the past century that stand as milestones of American business history.) 

   BUCK ROGERS, THE HERO of the 1929-1967 adventure strip, had less trouble with his ray gun than did <DATE>1958</DATE> inventors of an idea for a beam device later called a laser. 

   <PERSON>Arthur L. Schawlow</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Bell Laboratories</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Charles H. Townes</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Bell</ORGANIZATION> consultant from <ORGANIZATION>Columbia University</ORGANIZATION>, on <DATE>Dec. 15, 1958</DATE>, published their "optical maser" paper and also filed the patent, assigned to <ORGANIZATION>Bell</ORGANIZATION>. 
"Maser" is for "microwave amplification by stimulated emission of radiation." 

   But <PERSON>Gordon Gould</PERSON>, also of <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION>, in an over-two-decade battle claimed he recorded his similar "laser" idea in <DATE>November 1957</DATE> with a candy store notary. 
"Laser" stands for "light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation." 

   Both "masers" and "lasers" are devices containing crystal, gas or other substances that get atoms so excited as they bounce back and forth in step between two mirrors that they finally burst out in one coherent beam. 
Other light rays are merely incoherent waves. 

   <PERSON>Gould</PERSON> argued that his work was classified so he couldn't make his patent filing before <PERSON>Bell</PERSON>'s. 
After the long dispute, he won his patent on <DATE>Oct. 11, 1977</DATE>, by which time the <ORGANIZATION>Bell</ORGANIZATION> patent had expired. 
On <DATE>March 1, 1982</DATE>, a court upheld his victory, and he became rich. 
In <DATE>December 1988</DATE> he won still another laser patent. 

   Neither <PERSON>Gould</PERSON> nor the Schawlow-Townes team ever made a working laser. 
The first one, using a ruby crystal, was built by <PERSON>Theodore H. Maiman</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Hughes Aircraft</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1960</DATE>. 

   Today there are millions of lasers, ranging in size from a grain of salt to a living room. 
They are used in everything from eye operations to automated supermarket checkouts to compact disc players to phone systems and three-dimensional photos. 
Future lasers could knock out enemy spacecraft. 
Welcome back, <ORGANIZATION>Buck Rogers</ORGANIZATION>.

  [Abstract] A scientific conference was held on 30 <DATE>December 
1992</DATE> by the <ORGANIZATION>Department of General Physics</ORGANIZATION> and Astronomy of the 
<ORGANIZATION>Russian Academy of Sciences</ORGANIZATION> at its <ORGANIZATION>Institute of Problems in 
Physics</ORGANIZATION> imeni <PERSON>P.L. Kapitsa</PERSON>. Three lectures on the topic of 
femtosecond pulses and their usefulness in physics were given: 
  1. ``Current Trends in Research on Femtosecond Pulses and 
Possibilities of Their Use in Experimental Studies Pertaining to 
Nonlinear Quantum Electrodynamics'' by <ORGANIZATION>P.G. Kryukov</ORGANIZATION>; 
  2. ``Nonlinear Propagation of Femtosecond Pulses Through 
Fiber-Optic Waveguides'' by Ye.M. Dianov, <ORGANIZATION>A.M. Prokhorov</ORGANIZATION>, and 
<PERSON>V.N. Serkin</PERSON>; 
  3. ``Generation of Ultrahigh-Intensity Optical Fields by 
<ORGANIZATION>Powerful Femtosecond Laser Systems Including Excimer-Laser 
Amplifiers</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Experiments Relating</ORGANIZATION> to Emission of Ultrashort 
X-Ray Pulses'' by <PERSON>V.M. Gordiyenko</PERSON>, <PERSON>N.I. Koroteyev</PERSON>, and <ORGANIZATION>V.T. 
Platonenko</ORGANIZATION>. 
  In this report is summarized the content of the third 
lecture, which relates to development of ``desktop'' terawatt 
lasers emitting femtosecond radiation pulses of only 0.01-1 J 
energy. The mechanism of the process includes ``inertial 
conservation'' of the laser-induced plasma during its expansion, 
heat transfer deeper into the target mainly by diffusion being 
the main factor which limits the plasma temperature. When the 
radiation intensity exceeds the 
10[.sup]18-[/]-10[.sup]19[/] W/cm[.sup]2[/], then light 
pressure exceeds thermodynamic pressure while the plasma 
temperature climbs to thousands of electron-volts and the 
electron concentration reaches 10[.sup]23[/]-10[.sup]24[/] 
cm[.sup]-3[/] under pressures of 10-100 Mbar. Under these 
conditions the motion of free electrons shifts into the 
relativistic mode, which imparts unique properties to a 
femtosecond surface plasma so that it becomes a new object of 
basic research. This applies particularly to the electrodynamics 
of interaction of high-intensity radiation and a rapidly 
expanding steep high-temperature plasma front, also to the 
emission of x-rays by such a plasma. The laser facility built at 
the <ORGANIZATION>Moscow State University</ORGANIZATION> under the late <ORGANIZATION>S.A. Akhmanov</ORGANIZATION> 
includes solid-state visible lasers with a 1-10 <ORGANIZATION>GW</ORGANIZATION> power rating 
and an molecular XeCl excimer laser with a 10-100 <ORGANIZATION>GW</ORGANIZATION> power 
rating which emit 570-630 nm radiation and 308 nm radiation 
respectively, in pulses of about 40 fs duration. Proper focusing 
makes attainable a radiation intensity even higher than 
10[.sup]16[/] W/cm[.sup]2[/] at the target surface. Owing 
to the low optical density of a surface plasma, most of its 
x-ray emission energy lines within the resonance lines of its 
ions. With the aid of multilayer resonance mirrors it therefore 
becomes possible to extract strong narrow-band x-ray pulses and 
especially so from plasmas with hydrogen-like or helium-like 
ions. Theoretical analysis of the x-ray emission mechanism 
indicates that thin-film targets of about 100 nm thickness form 
laser-induced plasmas which make effective sources of hard 
x-rays. In this the heat is retained at the target, because the 
dissipation mechanism is inactive here, so that a less than 
usual intensity of the ``heating'' laser beam will be adequate.

  [Abstract] The principle of differential infrared 
absorption with scattering is considered for sounding the 
atmosphere and its contaminants, especially CFCl[.sub]3[/] 
(Freon-11) CF[.sub]2[/]Cl[.sub]2[/] (Freon-12), and 
CCl[.sub]4[/]. Inasmuch as <ORGANIZATION>TEA CO</ORGANIZATION>[.sub]2[/]-lasers are 
inadequate for this purpose owing to the presence of transverse 
modes and the decorrelating effect of the atmosphere along with 
instability of the radiation intensity and poor reproducibility, 
an ammonia-nitrogen 9-13 ?m laser with resonant pumping by a 
pulsed CO[.sub]2[/]-laser is proposed instead. The optics 
include three diffraction gratings: G[.sub]1[/] (100 
lines/mm, 30? glancing angle) on the exit side of the pump 
laser cavity, G[.sub]2[/] (75 lines/mm, 23? glancing 
angle) behind the first, G[.sub]3[/] (100 lines/mm, 30? 
glancing angle) on the exit side of the NH[.sub]3[/]-laser. 
Pump radiation from the <ORGANIZATION>CO</ORGANIZATION>[.sub]2[/] laser impinges on the 
first grating, whereupon radiation leaving its zeroth order 
impinges almost normally on the second grating and then through 
its first order enters the cell with NH[.sub]3[/]. The 
optical cavity for this active medium is formed by a spherical 
opaque mirror with a 10 m radius off the optical axis in front 
and the third grating on the optical axis behind. The opaque 
mirror is positioned so that it reflects radiation emitted by 
the NH[.sub]3[/] laser onto the second grating, which then 
rereflects this radiation back into the cavity along with the 
pump radiation. Addition of nitrogen not only boosts the 
emission efficiency (to <PERCENT>20 %</PERCENT>) and the energy of emitted 
pulses 
(to 1.5 J) but also appreciably widens the emission spectrum (up 
to 13.5 ?m). Absence of optically weak elements inside the 
cavity makes possible periodically-pulsed operation of the 
NH[.sub]3[/]-N[.sub]2[/] laser. The laser is tuned by 
rotation of that third grating. Emission of 10-1000 ns long 
radiation pulses is achieved by passive locking of longitudinal 
modes. For measurement duty the system is modified and includes 
only two gratings. The first one (64 lines/mm, 31? glancing 
angle) tunes the pump radiation from the CO[.sub]2[/]-laser 
to one of the two absorption lines of the sR(5,k) transition in 
ammonia and thus, with the aid of a compound cavity formed by 
that grating and two mirrors, splits that radiation into two 
beams of unequal intensities. The cavity of the 
NH[.sub]3[/]-N[.sub]2[/] laser is now formed by this 
grating, another mirror, and the second grating (100 lines/mm, 
37? glancing angle). This grating tunes the radiation from 
that laser to the absorption line of whichever contaminating 
impurity in air is being targeted, for use as the probing 
radiation. The system now also includes a transceiver into which 
the first grating sends both tuned pump radiation and tuned 
probing radiation, not together but in separate differently 
directed beams brought together into the transceiver upon their 
reflection by another mirror each. Figures 2; tables 1;

  [Abstract] Considering that stable radiation emission by a 
liquid laser requires a sufficiently large number of molecules 
in the active medium, a uniform distribution of the liquid over 
the emission zone, and a precisely aligned high-Q dispersive 
optical cavity, these conditions are applied to dye lasers 
featuring the best performance characteristics of all: not only 
wavelength-tunability over the 0.26-1.3 ?m range and up to 10 
kW power emission pulse but also compactness and cost 
effectiveness. When dye and solvent are being thoroughly mixed 
while being pumped by pulse trains of optical radiation, 
however, both hydrodynamic and photothermodynamic turbulence 
with attendant heat-induced convection of the solution will 
inevitably develop as the dye flow rate and the pump radiation 
intensity exceed the respective critical ones. The result will 
be randomization of the emission process with attendant lowering 
of both pump and laser efficiency. In search of a way to avoid 
this drawback, the dye excitation and lasing dynamics are 
analyzed for limitations on stable and efficient performance. As 
the main limiting factors are regarded not only both turbulence 
modes and thermal convection but also photodecay of dye 
molecules upon incidence of a pumping radiation pulse, their 
subsequent restoration, and the stroboscopic effect. As the 
optimum construction of the active element is selected a 
cylindrical cell with dye solution and a cylindrical mixing 
device inside. Thus are established the conditions under which a 
``window'' will exist in the dependence of emission irregularity 
on the dye flow characteristics and the pump radiation 
characteristics within which the emission process is least 
disordered, allowing a dye flow rate sufficiently high for 
stable replacement of dye molecules during the interval between 
pump radiation pulses. The relations established in this 
analysis indicate the feasibility of a laser with dye molecules 
in different instantaneous states and thus of wavelength tuning 
without a resonator. A rhodamine-6G laser pumped by a neodymium 
laser with second-harmonic 10 kW radiation pulses of 10 ns 
duration was designed and built. Tests revealed no turbulence 
throughout the 1.2x10[.sup]-7[/]-1333 l/s range of dye flow 
through the emission zone. References 8.

  [Abstract] During the 1984-92 period the <ORGANIZATION>Institute of Radio 
Engineering and Electronics</ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION>Russian Academy of Sciences</ORGANIZATION> 
intensified research in the field of quantum electronics, the 
three main areas being: 
1) fiber- optics technology, 
2) laser materials and devices, 
3) spectroscopy based on nuclear-magnetic resonance or on 
luminescence. 
  In the first area have been for the first time developed: 
a) a method of extruding single-mode fibers with sheaths made of 
fluorine-doped quartz glass for 1.3-1.55 ?m infrared light 
b) a new technology for producing anisotropic single-mode fibers 
which maintain the polarization and the intensity of light with 
minimal losses 
c) a laboratory technology for producing single-mode fibers 
which transmit 1.3 ?m light with an only 0.7 dB/km maximum 
loss 
d) a method of welding together different fibers with an only 
0.5 dB loss per joint. In addition to improvement of the 
extruding apparatus, there have been developed a plasmochemical 
variant of vertical lateral deposition for glass-forming oxides 
with use of organometallic compounds as initial reactants, a 
method of producing large-aperture fibers, a method of producing 
low-loss multimode fibers. A new method of forming anisotropic 
``bow tie'' fibers, with the aid of thermal shields, has been 
proposed and demonstrated. A high magnetic susceptibility of 
single-mode fibers has been attained by use of using rare-earth 
elements as dopants. For the first time has been developed a 
tubeless method of lateral deposition of thin fluorosilicate 
sheaths on quartz rods in a microwave plasma. Jointly with the 
<ORGANIZATION>Institute of Optical Physics</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Scientific Research 
Institute of Electrical Systems</ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION>Ministry of Electrical 
Industry</ORGANIZATION> have been produced radiation-resistant power fibers, 
radiation-resistant and mechanically strong single-mode and 
multimode fibers, thick fiber strands for optical cables, and 
large-aperture low-loss fibers doped with various rare-earth 
elements as well as large-aperture quartz-quartz fibers for 
transmitting up to 500 W of laser radiation power with <PERCENT>80%</PERCENT> 
efficiency. Other developments include deposition of polymer 
sheaths, new silicon elastomers for fiber coatings which will 
ensure at least <PERCENT>99%</PERCENT> transmission, and a cryogenic 
microcable 
for temperatures from 80?C down to -60?C. Theoretical 
studies have yielded a theory of microflexure and a new model of 
hydrolytic fracture of quartz fibers. New apparatus with 
fiber-optic components for measuring physical quantities and 
methods of doing it have also been developed, the components 
including fiber thermooptic channel switches, <PERSON>Fourier</PERSON> analyzers, 
a random-access memory, polarizers, light modulators, two-mode 
reflectometers, directional couplers, temperature and magnetic 
field transducers. Work has furthermore been done on several 
practical applications of fiber-optic technology. In the area of 
laser materials and devices there have been developed a method 
of hardening phosphate glass, a new Cr-Y-Er glass for 
heat-resistant minilasers and high-efficiency low- threshold 
quatrons, a 1.5 ?m Er-minilaser suitable for a record high 7 
Hz pulse repetition rate, borate glass activated with Yb and Er. 
There also have for the first time been achieved parametric 
resonance emission of ultraviolet picosecond pulses and 
continuous high-efficiency emission by Nd ions. Other new 
developments include powder lasers (Nd-ion implanted in powders 
of La oxide or oxysulfide, binary Na, La, <ORGANIZATION>Ba</ORGANIZATION>, or Gd chromate- 
molybdate, La-Sr niobate, and Ga-Yb sulfide with Nd impurity), a 
new kind of mirrors using resonant metal screens for optically 
pumped lasers, a highly long-time stable 
CO[.sub]2[/]-OsO[.sub]4[/], and diffusely reflecting 
coatings (aluminum, fused quartz, phosphate glass) for laser 
reflectors, also a new method of hardening phosphate glass for 
active media and a new method of welding together glasses 
containing chromium. The feasibility of producing fibers for 
high-efficiency transmission of infrared light has been proposed 
on the basis of theoretical analysis and then demonstrated 
experimentally on fibers transmitting 1.5 ?m at an average 
power of 2 W with an up to <PERCENT>30 %</PERCENT> efficiency. With 
low-energy 
ultraviolet lasers, efficient frequency conversion by stimulated 
Raman scattering has been achieved in a multipass vessel 
containing methane under a pressure of 30 atm. Research was done 
on both electron-magnetic resonance and nuclear- magnetic 
resonance spectroscopy, studies of the latter having revealed a 
``cascade'' narrowing of the <ORGANIZATION>NMR</ORGANIZATION> spectra owing to concurrent 
action of a strong radio-frequency field and slow molecular 
movements in solids. As to generators of electromagnetic 
signals, there have been developed microminiature microwave 
vacuum devices including solid-state oscillators such as 
transistors, avalanche diodes, and Gunn-effect diodes. More than 
80 scientific articles have been published during that period.

  [Abstract] A novel emission mode of a free-electron x-ray 
laser with counterpropagating electron beam and optical pump 
laser (``optical wiggler'') beam, namely its quantum emission 
mode where emission of an x-ray quantum changes the electronic 
state appreciably, is analyzed by comparing it with its 
classical mode of operation. Interaction of relativistic 
electrons with both electromagnetic pump and signal fields, for 
simplicity assuming a collinear geometry. Such a laser with an 
optical pump differs from one with a conventional magnetostatic 
one in that its emission and absorption lines are completely 
separated so that the ratio = h/_D_|e of the distance h_o_ 
(h- Planck constant, _o_- frequency) between them to their 
effective width _D__e_ is _ee_ &gt; &gt;  1, while with a 
magnetic pump 
this ratio is _ee_ &lt;&lt; 1. Analysis of three-wave 
interaction 
confirms the validity of treating the laser as one with a 
completely inverted two-level active medium and describing its 
electron dynamics with the Klein-Gordon equation. By virtue of 
the conservation laws, the problem of transitions in a continuum 
reduces to the problem of resonance excitation of discrete 
levels in an anharmonic oscillator. This leads to a 
self-consistent closed nonlinear system of four partial 
differential equations completely describing the emission 
dynamics of such a laser: two equations the evolution of slowly 
varying amplitudes a[.sub]0[/](z,t) and a[.sub]-1[/](z,t), 
one equation the propagation of emission pulses, and one 
equation the evolution of the high-frequency signal. This system 
is analogous to the system of Maxwell-Bloch equations describing 
the interaction of a two-level atomic medium with a resonance 
field. The performance characteristics of this laser are 
calculated for the case of quasi-steady amplification with the 
durations of not only the high-frequency pump and signal pulses 
but also of the electron cluster much longer than the 
characteristic dimension of the interaction space divided by the 
speed of light. The laser is shown to be more efficient in the 
quantum mode than in the classical mode of operation, transition 
from the latter to the former being achievable by widening the 
energy range within the electron beam. References 24.

   Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing Co. said its researchers
have developed the first blue-green laser diode, calling it a
"major breakthrough in laser technology."
   The prototype device has the potential to triple or
quadruple the amount of data that can be stored on optical
and compact discs, the St. Paul, Minn., company said. It also
"opens new opportunities" for laser applications in fields
such as imaging, printing and communications.

<TEXT>
   But 3M cautioned that "we're targeting two years" to
resolve technical hurdles before the so-called semiconductor
diode could become commercially viable.
   Semiconductor diodes, the size of a grain of sand or
smaller, convert electrical signals into tiny laser beams.
While best known for their use in recording and playing
compact discs, the inexpensive laser-producing chips are also
used in a host of other communication devices. But the chips
currently produce light only at the infrared -- or sometimes
visible red -- end of the spectrum.
   The laser diode developed by 3M produces "the shortest
wavelength ever generated by a semiconductor laser diode,"
the scientists said. The smaller the laser beam's wavelength,
the more densely it can pack optical data into an
informationstorage device.
   The 3M scientists' work is to be published shortly in the
science journal Applied Physics Letters.
   The 3M researchers used a new combination of materials to
construct the laser diode. While the chip's surface still
rests on a conventional base of gallium arsenide, the company
said its scientists were the first to successfully make use
of zinc selenide.
   For decades, the scientists wrote, zinc selenide has been
"promising" for development of a diode laser that could
produce visible light, but difficulties in "doping" the
compounds -- chemically treating them to make them effective
as semiconductors -- had previously blocked use of the
unconventional combination. Recent technological developments
both in doping and alternative treatments have lowered the
barriers, the scientists said.
   Other companies, both in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, are hard at
work on diodes that produce visible light. Scientists at
<ORGANIZATION>International Business Machines Corp.</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Almaden Research
Center</ORGANIZATION> last year created a "potentially practical source of
blue laser light," by passing an infrared laser beam from a
conventional diode through a special crystal. The crystal
effectively halves the resulting beam's wavelength, bringing
it into the visible spectrum.
   <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION>'s experimental blue-laser device currently converts
electricity into light at about <PERCENT>10%</PERCENT> efficiency; 3M said its
prototype is about <PERCENT>20%</PERCENT> to <PERCENT>25%</PERCENT> efficient.
   <PERSON>Charles Walker</PERSON>, head of 3M's <ORGANIZATION>Photonics Research Lab</ORGANIZATION>, said
the researchers are "absolutely thrilled" with the device.
But he said "We have to . . . take it from something that
operates in a pulsed mode at low power at room temperature,
to something that operates in the continuous mode at room
temperature." The device currently operates continuously only
at extremely low temperatures.

  [Abstract] A Nd-glass laser set for thermonuclear fusion 
consisting was built and tested, a set consisting of a master 
oscillator and two successive amplifier stages with phase 
conjugation and pulse compression. The oscillator operates in 
the single longitudinal mode and single transverse mode. The two 
amplifiers operate in the four-pass mode. The beam emitted by 
the oscillator in pulses of 3 mJ energy and 25 ns duration 
passes through a x10 magnifying telescope, a 12x12 
mm[.sup]2[/] large aperture stop, and then two Faraday 
isolators before entering the first amplifier stage. The active 
medium here is a cylinder of neodymium glass 20 mm in diameter 
and 300 mm long. This preamplifier stage includes a cell filled 
with Ar + SF[.sub]6[/] mixture, where an SBMS (Stimulated 
Brillouin-Mandelshtam Scattering) mirror for phase conjugation 
is formed by a focusing lens with a 50 cm focal length. After 
four passes in this stage and with the energy of radiation thus 
having been boosted to 3-4 J, the beam proceeds through a x3.3 
magnifying telescope, a Faraday isolator with a 60x60 
mm[.sup]2[/] large aperture, and then a x2.5 magnifying 
telescope before entering with a 100x100 mm[.sup]2[/] 
aperture the second amplifier stage. The active medium here is 
an array of six slabs of neodymium glass 340 mm long with a 
20x120 mm[.sup]2[/] large cross-section each. They are 
optically pumped by seven rows of four IFP-5000 flash lamps 
between each two slabs, distilled water thermally insulating the 
slabs from these lamps. Each slab is followed sends radiation to 
a cell filled with Ar + SF[.sub]6[/] mixture, an SBMS mirror 
for phase conjugation in the pulse compression mode being formed 
in each by a 17 mm[.sup]2[/] large square lens with a 5 m 
focal length. Upon entering this second amplifier stage, the 
beam is thus split into six separate partial beams with a 17x100 
mm[.sup]2[/] large aperture each. It then leaves this stage 
with an about 100x100 mm[.sup]2[/] large compound aperture, 
the duration of radiation pulses having in this stage been 
shortened 20 ns to 2 ns duration. The energy reflectivity of the 
mirrors here is estimated at <PERCENT>50 %</PERCENT>. Two tests were 
performed: 1) 
with direct passage of the beam passage through the second 
stage, 2) with reflection of the beam first by only one lateral 
face of each slab and then by their both faces. Direct passage 
was found to cause breakdown of the active medium near the 
lateral faces of the slabs, but radiation pulses of <DATE>20-25</DATE> J 
energy were nevertheless coming from each slab. Reflection by 
one lateral face resulted in a more uniform distribution of 
radiation intensity over the beam cross- section and reflection 
by both lateral faces resulted its most nearly uniform 
distribution. In the latter case the divergence of the total 
radiation beam was smaller than 0.1 mrad, while the energy of 
radiation pulses from each slab still reached the 25 J level. 
Such a laser set can be modified for simultaneous radiation 
emission at two different frequencies. This can be achieved by 
splitting the beam into two in the preamplifier stage, using a 
device such as a Fresnel biprism, and directing each half- beam 
to a different SBMS mirror cell: one containing a compressed gas 
and one containing a solid substance. Then while the beam is 
being focused, a traveling interference pattern will form in the 
focal plane owing to different radiation wavelengths in the two 
half-apertures. Figures 3; references 3.

<FÊP=106> [Leonid Mlechin report: "New Generation of Lasers Could </F>
Soon Enter Various Armies' Arsenals"] 
  [Text] The <ORGANIZATION>International Red Cross Committee</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Geneva</LOCATION> has 
appealed to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>, urging that the 
development of laser weapons, which can blind a person, be 
stopped. 
  The <ORGANIZATION>Red Cross</ORGANIZATION> is hoping to obtain a formal UN ban on the 
development and production of laser weapons. They are silent 
and invisible weapons. A person does not know that a laser is 
being aimed at him and has no time to prepare himself and 
somehow protect himself. 
  Laser weapons are an object of desire for all armies' 
generals. Several attempts to provide themselves with the combat 
lasers featured in science fiction novels have been dashed 
against the immutable laws of physics. In order to make a laser 
beam capable of burning through something it must be focused: 
This is impossible at long distances because of the law of 
diffraction. But it is also impossible to kill enemy soldiers or 
destroy his armored vehicles at short distances using modern 
lasers. So far lasers have found a use in high-precision 
weapons guidance systems. 
  According to information available to the <ORGANIZATION>Red Cross</ORGANIZATION>, a new 
generation of lasers could soon enter Western armies' arsenals. 
At a 1km radius such a weapon, <ORGANIZATION>Red Cross</ORGANIZATION> specialists claim, 
could permanently blind a person. One of the aims is to blind 
aircrew. The <LOCATION>Geneva</LOCATION> committee also fears that portable and 
easy-to-use combat lasers could fall into the hands of 
terrorists. 
  The demand to stop the development of laser weapons will 
make 
life difficult not only for the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> but also for 
<LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION>, which has overtaken the West in the development of 
lasers for terrestrial and space use. Millions of what were 
then noninflationary rubles went on attempts to develop lasers 
to destroy satellites and ballistic missiles in space. 
  Tracked laser guns were developed by the "Luch" central 
design bureau and then the "Astrofizika" science and production 
association, which was led by <PERSON>Nikolay Ustinov</PERSON>, son of <PERSON>Dmitriy 
Ustinov</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Central Committee</ORGANIZATION> secretary for the military industry 
and later defense minister. In 20 years <MONEY>200 million rubles</MONEY> were 
spent and a dozen vulnerable tracked monsters which had no 
chance on the battlefield were constructed. 
  Under <PERSON>Gorbachev</PERSON> work to improve the monster was halted. 
According to <ORGANIZATION>IZVESTIYA</ORGANIZATION> reports work was recently resumed. 
Possibly the generals are unable to abandon their long-standing 
dream. Maybe physics research is not standing still and there 
will be new opportunities to decrease the dimensions of combat 
lasers and make them cheaper. Their task is to disable the 
enemy's optical guidance instruments and blind operators. When 
enemy positions are illuminated by a laser beam the electronic 
optical guidance systems (of an aircraft, missile launcher, 
tank, artillery piece, or firearm) will themselves focus this 
beam and be disabled. If at this moment the operator is looking 
through the guidance instrument's eyepiece he will lose his 
sight.

  [TEXT] Hopes for a major advance in technology and 
development--<LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s lead to be overtaken. 
  Thirty-four years after the discovery of the first laser, 
another generational shift in high-efficiency lasers is again 
approaching with the transition from tube technology to 
semi-conductor technology, or from gas laser to diode laser. In 
the areas of entertainment electronics and communications and 
information technology, the replacement of tube technology with 
semiconductor technology has already made possible and produced 
revolutionary developments. 
  It is expected that a similar major advance in technology 
and 
development in [the area of] high-efficiency lasers will 
fundamentally shape future laser equipment technology and open 
up new fields of application. The German government intends to 
support this development with the joint Laser <DATE>2000</DATE> program, 
which <ORGANIZATION>Federal Minister of Research</ORGANIZATION> and Technology <PERSON>Paul Krueger</PERSON> 
has now introduced in <LOCATION>Bonn</LOCATION>. 
  Preparing the generational shift in technology with 
high-efficiency lasers is the object and goal of the pilot 
project, already started at the beginning of the year, on 
high-efficiency diode lasers and diode-pumped solid-state 
lasers. It has to do with developing a small, compact, 
high-efficiency, low- maintenance laser. It is expected that 
such an generation of lasers will open up broad markets. 
Materials processing in particular is being considered in this

  [Abstract] Use of a fluorescent lidar with an excimer laser 
for measuring from a distance the thickness of films of 
petroleum products on water is considered, determination of the 
film thickness involving as usually two measurements of the 
fluorescence intensity of water twice: with and without the 
film. The principle of this method is based on the dependence of 
the hydrooptical properties, reflectivity and absorptivity, on 
the film thickness. These relations were studied experimentally 
with an XeCl-laser exciting the films with 308 nm radiation. 
Both absorption and emission spectra of various petroleum 
products, lubricants and fuels in cyclohexane solution, were 
measured in a spectrophotometer. The fluorescence intensity of 
such films on water was measured with a laboratory apparatus 
which included this XeCl laser and an aligning it He-Ne laser, 
two photomultipliers, a pyroelectric radiation receiver, an 
MDR-4 monochromator with a spectrally 2 nm wide slit, and four 
objectives consisting each of a mating biconvex and 
concavo-plane lens pair. A rotating wedge diverted a part of the 
excitation beam through either the first objective into the 
first photomultiplier or through the second objective into the 
pyroelectric radiation receiver. A right-angle prism reflected 
the remaining part of the excitation radiation through the third 
objective into the test cell with a specimen. A rotating plane 
mirror reflected the radiation from the fluorescing specimen 
through the fourth objective and then the monochromator into the 
second photomultiplier. Tests were performed on successively 
3-9-15-30 ?m thick films, with an XeCl-laser emitting 
radiation in pulses of 30 mJ energy and 30 ns duration at an 
either 0.1 Hz or 0.25 Hz repetition rate. Fluorescence was 
recorded within the 320-410 nm band, the maximum fluorescence 
signal shifting farter into the long-wave region as a light 
petroleum product was being replaced with successively heavier 
ones. With increasing film thickness, the fluorescence signal 
normalized to the Raman scattering signal was found to increase 
up to the fluorescence saturation level. Therefore, use of an 
excimer laser is recommended only for thin (d &lt; 15 ?m) 
films 
of petroleum products on water. Figures 3; references 9.

  [Abstract] Following a review of basic Doppler radar 
principles applied to detection of moving objects and 
determination of their velocities by measurement of Doppler 
reflection spectra, a Doppler radar with an optical rangefinder 
is described which has been developed and built for monitoring 
motor vehicles which move through dust clouds. The light source 
is an LGN-901 CO[.sub]2[/]-laser with operating at a power 
level of about 3 W. Its radiation is stabilized by means of a 
piezoceramic corrector and a diffraction grating, whereupon a 
primary plane <ORGANIZATION>Cu</ORGANIZATION> mirror reflects it at a 90? angle onto a <ORGANIZATION>Ge</ORGANIZATION> 
plate for splitting into an object beam and a reference beam. 
The object beam is twice reflected upon 45? incidence on two 
successive plane mirrors, for passage along a parallel path 
through a diaphragm into a collimating lens which reduces its 
divergence to one eighth of the original. The collimated beam, 
40 mm in diameter with a 0.6 mrad divergence angle, is then 
reflected by a plane scanning mirror onto the road under 
observation, whereupon a part of the returning beam is reflected 
by the same scanning mirror into a receiving objective coaxial 
with the collimator and operating in the Cassagrain mode. The 
objective lens has a 1000 mm focal length and a 200 mm outside 
diameter, its 110 mm inside diameter being larger than that of 
the collimating lens. The objective focuses the incoming 
radiation on the diffraction spot on the 0.2x0.2 mm[.sup]2[/] 
large light-sensitive surface of a HgCdTe photodetector, a 
high-speed photodiode with a 30 MHz wide passband. The reference 
beam meanwhile passes through two successive acoustooptic 
modulators operating at close to one another frequencies (40 MHz 
and 39.6 MHz) and then, after reflection by another plane 
mirror, through the receiving objective to the photodiode. For 
automatic frequency control another photodetector, a 
photoresistor with 1x1 mm[.sup]2[/] large light-sensitive 
surface and a 1 MHz wide passband, is placed at the entrance to 
the laser. Such a configuration of the optical system enables 
the radar set to operate in the energy mode and in the 
heterodyne mode without additional tuning. Use of two modulators 
significantly weakens the effect of direct illumination at the 
carrier frequency in the reference channel. The radar is 
calibrated against a foam plastic panel set into 50 Hz vibration 
by a 10GD-30 loudspeaker head. Figures 2; references 2.

  [Abstract] Construction of a Doppler wind lidar using a TEA 
(transverse excitation atmospheric pressure) pulsed 
single-frequency CO[.sub]2[/] injection laser for coherent 
reception and processing of data on winds in the lower 
atmospheric layers at altitudes up to 15 km. The design of such 
a lidar is based on the fundamental equation relating the 
signal-to-noise ratio to parameters of the sounding radiation 
pulses and of the atmospheric medium, the solution to this 
equation indicating the amount of energy needed for a sounding 
radiation pulse to reach the desired altitude. A laser set of 
this type with automatic ultraviolet preionization features both 
simplicity and reliability. Its one drawback is the sweeping of 
the emission frequency caused by presence of discharge electrons 
in the active medium, resonance polarization of <ORGANIZATION>CO</ORGANIZATION>[.sub]2[/] 
molecules, and acoustic expansion of heated gas. This sweep is 
best measured by optical heterodyning with radiation of a 
continuous-wave single-frequency reference CO[.sub]2[/]-laser 
and subsequent mixing the two signals in a HgCdTe photodetector 
for processing with the aid of an analog-to-digital converter. 
The results of these measurements were used for optimizing the 
composition of the active medium so as to ensure both minimum 
width of the emission band and maximum emission energy. The 
active medium, a CO[.sub]2[/]:N[.sub]2[/]:He = 1.5:2.5:6 
mixture is confined inside a typically 5 m long linear resonator 
cavity, this cavity being formed by a spherical mirror with a 
typically 18 m radius and a germanium wedge. The cavity contains 
also a NaCl wedge through which an external signal is injected 
into the active medium and through which some laser radiation is 
extracted for mode locking. Mode locking is achieved by noting 
the instant of time at which the frequency of the injected 
signal coincides with the frequency of the natural cavity mode 
and at that instant initiating a discharge in the TEA 
compartment. This instant can be recorded by a signal peak 
detector as corresponding to the maximum intensity on the 
interference pattern, with the cavity mirror oscillating 
harmonically at a frequency of typically 180 Hz. Such a <ORGANIZATION>TEA 
CO</ORGANIZATION>[.sub]2[/]-laser and a telescope were included in the 
prototype of a Doppler wind lidar, also a continuous-wave 
reference CO[.sub]2[/]-laser and a HgCdTe photodetector with 
an output amplifier, a DVK-2 computer, and a CAMAC crate. A 
model needed for determination of the signal scattering in the 
atmosphere is based on the following premises: 1. scattering is 
done by a large number of arbitrarily located identical aerosol 
particles moving at the wind velocity, 2. atmospheric turbulence 
influences only the wavefront of backscattered radiation, 3. 
signal attenuation in the atmosphere obeys Bouger's law. With 
this lidar were measured wind velocities along horizontal and 
vertical paths, whereupon he data were used for calculating wind 
velocity profiles and their dispersions. The authors thank

  [Abstract] The emergence of low-power medical lasers and 
the resulting uses of such lasers on biological tissues as well 
reports that the use of noncoherent light sources and lasers in 
clinical practices leads to virtually indistinguishable results 
prompted renewed interest in developing light treatment devices 
using polymer optical fibers, especially since in most cases, 
the clinics do not have the facilities for retuning the laser 
radiation wavelength to match its spectrum with the resonant 
absorption lines of biologically significant molecules. The 
optical fiber will be able not only to transmit radiation 
bounded by the fiber end aperture but also the light generated 
by photoluminescence of the impurities. The structure of a 
two-layer optical fiber containing luminescing impurities and a 
block diagram of the fiber optic luminescent device are cited, 
and the design and operating principles of this low-intensity 
fiber optic luminescent device designed on the basis of the 
above characteristics are described in detail. The operating 
principle makes it possible to combine the function of injecting 
light into thin fibers and isolating spectral radiation bands 
which are most effective in given procedures. The device's 
ability to generate pulse radiation greatly increases the 
strength of the postoperative sutures; a 40 Hz frequency is 
optimal, and red light (600-680 nm) is the most efficient. 
Experiments with animals and donor blood demonstrates that 
monochromated light has a favorable effect on skin tissue 
regeneration. Figures 3; references 9.

  [Abstract] Passive synchronization of the modes of YAG:Nd 
and YAlO[.sup]3[/] lasers using 
CuInS[.sup]2x[/]Se[.sub]2(1- x)[/]-doped glasses is 
discussed. The optical block diagram of the laser is provided 
and its functioning is described. The laser resonator is formed 
by a spherical mirror and a planar output mirror. A passive 
synchronization of modes was obtained when glasses with 
CuInS[.sup]1.2[/]Se[.sub]0.8[/] monocrystal were used as 
passive gates in pulsed solid state neodymium lasers. The pulse 
width was 36 and 16 ns for the YAG:Nd-and YAlO[.sup]3[/]:Nd 
lasers, respectively. The passive gates operate as saturating 
absorbers at low intensities and perform negative feed-back at 
high radiation intensities. The glasses with 
CuInS[.sup]2x[/]Se[.sub]2(1-x)[/] are a promising material 
for semiconductor cavity saturating absorbers for solid state 
lasers operating in a self-starting mode. The saturating 
absorbers exhibit a rapid relaxation, and have low losses and 
high saturation intensities. They can operate in a nonlinear 
mode within resonators of solid state lasers, interacting with 
pulse intensities in a pico range. The required operating wave 
length can be selected within the 0.9-1.3 ?m range by 
changing 
the stoichiometry coefficient and composition of the glass.

  [Abstract] The feasibility of achieving an excimer laser 
with a condensed active medium is examined for theoretical and 
experimental purposes. Inasmuch as most advantageous is 
transition of noble gases to a condensed phase and among all 
excimer lasers these lasers emit shortest- wave radiation, 
lasers, the most easily achievable Xe[.sub]2[/]-laser is 
considered for specificity. The first problem is avoiding 
absorption of emission-wavelength radiation under conditions of 
high gas densities. The solution of this problem is based on 
analysis of the known structure of lower energy levels and 
origin of molecular luminescence bands, also helpful being the 
known luminescence spectrum of crystalline solid xenon at 5 K 
temperature. The most difficult next problem is adequate pumping 
of the entire solid or liquid active medium, electric-discharge 
pumping being preferable to inefficient pumping by another laser 
and difficult to arrange pumping by a lamp. The necessary 
conditions for attaining a homogeneous electric discharge with 
sufficiently high energy for excitation of Xe atoms by electron 
impact are established by analyzing the drift of fast excess 
electrons through gaseous and liquid or solid xenon with 
attendant elastic scattering by its atoms. As the intensity of 
the electric field is increased above E* ? _e_/b= 2 kV/cm 
for 
xenon (_e_- electron energy, b- mean displacement of electron 
prior to its thermalization), the energy lost by ``hot'' 
electrons during their collisions with Xe atoms is increasingly 
compensated by the energy imparted to the field so that the net 
loss becomes negligible in an electric field of intensity E 
&gt; &gt; 
E* (3 kV/cm for xenon). A solid Xe-laser constructed according 
to these guidelines has an H-form cell with already liquid xenon 
between two plane mirrors parallel to its two wide walls. Two 
electrodes,anode and cathode, are lining the cell wall on 
opposite sides along the narrow middle segment so as to produce 
a transverse electric discharge through xenon within this 
segment. No electron multiplication takes place in this system 
and use of an external electron source is inconvenient. Instead, 
for sustaining the discharge, the metal cathode is covered with 
a layer of a radioactive target material and a photoemissive 
coating of a high-yield (low work function) material on top. 
This ensures an electron avalanche by chain multiplication and 
thus makes it very likely feasible to build 30 kW lasers 
emitting ultraviolet radiation in pulses of up to 1 ms duration 
with an up to <PERCENT>30 %</PERCENT> efficiency, not only Xe- lasers (172 
nm) but 
also Kr-lasers (145 nm) and Ar-lasers (128 nm). Figures 6;

<TEXT>     When <PERSON>Mr. Bell</PERSON> co-founded <ORGANIZATION>Spectra-Physics</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION>, finding other ways to
"lase" wasn't a top priority, but he was searching, and so were others.;    In
<DATE>1961</DATE>, a team of scientists at <ORGANIZATION>Bell Laboratories</ORGANIZATION> operated a helium-neon gas
laser. <PERSON>Mr. Bell</PERSON> found a way to use it.;    "<PERSON>Earl Bell</PERSON> made the first
commercial helium-neon laser at <ORGANIZATION>Spectra-Physics</ORGANIZATION>," said <PERSON>Gene Watson</PERSON>, a former
colleague and now president of Chromex, a scientific instrument firm in
<LOCATION>Albuquerque</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.M</LOCATION>. It produced the red laser lines shoppers now see every time
they buy groceries at a supermarket checkout scanner.;    But the red line
wasn't enough for the researchers at <ORGANIZATION>Spectra-Physics</ORGANIZATION>. They wanted more
powerful laser lines, in shades of blue and green, and they sought to do it
not just with the gas itself but with the ions created when gas atoms are
excited, <PERSON>Watson</PERSON> said.;    "Earl was conducting an experiment to get mercury
vapor to 'lase,' " <PERSON>Watson</PERSON> said.;    "He came bursting out of the lab and said,
'We got it. We got the green line.' ";    <PERSON>Watson</PERSON> said he asked, "Is it the one
you're looking for?";    "Well, what difference does it make?" <PERSON>Mr. Bell</PERSON>
answered. "It's green.";    With that answer, <PERSON>Watson</PERSON> said he learned an
inventor's lesson: " 'It's not what you're looking for that's important,' <PERSON>Earl</PERSON>
would say. 'It's what you get that's important.' ";    What was important was
a breakthrough in laser technology. While <PERSON>Mr. Bell</PERSON> was using mercury vapor
ions to "lase," Bill Bridges of <ORGANIZATION>Hughes Aircraft</ORGANIZATION> was using argon ions. They
both got a green line, and it opened up a new world in surgery and optics.;   
<DATE>Today</DATE>, the gas ion laser represents a <MONEY>$100 million-plus</MONEY> industry, said <PERSON>Herbert

in medical uses, in microsurgery, but also in the graphics industry for
precise color separations," said <PERSON>Dwight</PERSON>, now chief executive officer of
<ORGANIZATION>Superconductor Technologies Inc.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Santa Barbara.</LOCATION>;    The other lesson <PERSON>Mr.
Bell</PERSON> taught his co-workers was about the implementation of ideas. They saw him
as the most prolific inventor they have ever known.;    When <PERSON>Mr. Bell</PERSON> died of
cancer at age 70 recently, he had detected more than 30 laser intensities.;   
"He discovered more laser lines than any other single researcher," said
<PERSON>Watson</PERSON>. "This guy stood so far apart from the others. He not only had a good
idea every day, he acted on them, reduced them to practice.";    If <PERSON>Mr. Bell</PERSON>
had good ideas in lasers, he also had ideas that helped the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>

of the compact atomic clock used on the Apollo moon mission. The research is

  [Text] <ORGANIZATION>NEC</ORGANIZATION> has developed a new type of laser element whose 
current required for laser oscillation is the smallest in the 
world. Pulsed radiation at room temperature with a current 
[threshold] value of 190 microamperes was achieved and this 
broke the previous world record. By way of comparison, this is 
less than one-tenth of the current used by conventional elements 
and it means a large reduction in electrical power for 
semiconductor lasers. The new element is also structured to 
accommodate high density integration and it can be useful for 
the realization of such things as super high speed optical 
computers, which use optical signals to process information, and 
optical circuitry devices. 
  The developed element is a type of surface-emission laser 
which emits radiation in a direction perpendicular to the 
substrate of the semiconductor. It emits infrared laser 
radiation at a wavelength of about 1 micron. The structure is 
unique in that the active radiation layer is sandwiched on both 
sides by multilayered semiconductor films. One side of the 
multilayered film is finely cut into a cylindrical shape. The 
diameter of the cylindrical part is 5 microns and the height is 
4 microns. 
  The multilayered film plays the role of a reflecting mirror 
for laser oscillation and by designing the thickness of one 
layer so that it is equal to the size of the wavelength, 
radiation loss is considerably limited. The conventional film 
layer has a margin of error of around <PERCENT>1 percent</PERCENT> but <ORGANIZATION>NEC</ORGANIZATION>, by 
successfully establishing conditions for molecular beam crystal 
growth technology [molecular beam epitaxy], held it down to less 
than <PERCENT>0.3 percent</PERCENT>. Moreover, by using a cylindrical structure, 
the radiation is efficiently confined inside it, and a reduction 
of the current value necessary for laser oscillation was 
achieved. 
  It was experimentally confirmed that the new element began 
oscillation at 190 microamperes and, at 2 milliamperes, there 
was an optical output of 50 microwatts. The world's smallest 
previous semiconductor oscillation current value was 250 
microamperes. However, the element holding the world record was 
a conventional type that oscillates in a direction horizontal to 
the substrate and integration was difficult. Basically, since 
the newly developed element is a surface emission-type, it can 
be integrated and manufactured just like an ordinary transistor. 
  Currently, the resistance of the element is large and the 
efficiency is low, making continuous oscillation impossible. The 
next step will be to make progress toward continuous oscillation 
and improvement in the efficiency. 
  The semiconductor laser element is mostly used by itself as 
an optical source for compact disks and optical communications. 
However, if multiple integration can be accomplished, its uses 
will be expanded. For example, there is a possibility for using 
it for such things as optical computers, which process imagery 
data without conversion into electrical signals, or as an 
optical source for high-speed optical circuitry which switches 
multiple signals. 
  When the operating current per semiconductor laser is high, 
large electric power is necessary and integration is difficult. 
In order to make integration practical, the problem has been 
that of how to reduce the value of the oscillation current.

  [Abstract] An unstable resonator is proposed for the 
LIT-100 commercial YAG:Nd laser. The active medium of this laser 
consists of two cylindrical YAG:Nd rods 100 mm long and 6.3 mm 
in diameter, a thermal lens being induced in each. They are now 
placed each inside a single-lamp ellipsoidal reflector-luminaire 
and each pumped with a 24 A - 150 Hz current supplying a power 
of 5.5 kW. These luminaires are very energy-efficient but, owing 
to multimode radiation emission by the active medium, they form 
a widely divergent radiation beam. Stable resonators in the form 
of long planar cavities minimize the beam divergence, but with 
an attendant loss of power caused by distortions of higher 
orders than those due to formation of the thermal lenses in the 
active medium. Unstable resonators operating on the negative 
branch of the stability curve are known to minimize the beam 
divergence with minimum energy loss. Two variants of such a 
resonator have been designed and tested. The telescopic 
resonator providing an M= -1.7 magnification has a cavity formed 
by two concave mirrors with respectively 0.67 m and 0.4 m radii 
of curvature, the latter having a 3.6 mm diameter. The focus of 
each mirror coincides with the focus of the nearest to it 
thermal lens, the two thermal lenses having the same focal 
length and the distance between them being equal to twice that 
focal length. This resonator forms a radiation beam similar to 
that formed by a ``cat's eye'' reflector and not much better 
than that of the LIT-100 laser. The other resonator has a cavity 
formed by two plane total-reflection back mirrors and an exit 
mirror with a hole smaller than 6.3 mm in diameter. The image of 
this hole, formed by the two thermal intracavity lenses, 
coincides with it and the radiation beam thus exits through it 
with hardly any loss of power. Such a resonator with 
self-imaging of the exit hole rendered the best performance when 
its critical dimensions were: 1. diameter of exit hole d= 5.2 
mm, 2. focal length of thermal lenses f= 1 m, 3. distance from 
focus of the thermal lens before the exit mirror to the nearest 
back mirror L= 0.74 m. With this resonator the laser delivered a 
power of 160 W (80 W per rod) in a beam with a 1.6 mrad 
divergence angle (at <PERCENT>86%</PERCENT> maximum intensity level).

  [Text] Abundant nonlinear processes may be produced in 
submillimeter-size hohlraum targets by 1.053 ?m laser light 
with duration of 1 ns and energy of 300-600 J. In experiments, 
Stimulated Brillouin Scattering (SBS) and Stimulated Raman 
Scattering (SRS) were directly measured, and Resonance 
Absorption (RA), Two-Plasmon Decay (TPD), and Ion Acoustic Decay 
(IAD) were observed indirectly. The experimental results show 
that <ORGANIZATION>SBS</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>SRS</ORGANIZATION> are the dominant nonlinear processes in cavity; 
they can scatter about <PERCENT>40 percent</PERCENT> of the incident laser energy. 
Electron plasma waves stimulated by nonlinear processes such as 
<ORGANIZATION>SRS</ORGANIZATION>, TPD, RA, and <ORGANIZATION>IAD</ORGANIZATION> are the sources of suprathermal electron 
generation. Our research indicates that <ORGANIZATION>SRS</ORGANIZATION> is the chief process 
for electron plasma-wave generation in hohlraum targets, and it 
can produce suprathermal electrons with a total energy about <PERCENT>10 
percent</PERCENT> of incident laser energy. Because spectra of nonlinear 
process scattering light are closely related to the plasma 
state, we can obtain information about the plasma state through 
intensive measurement and analysis of these spectra of the 
scattering light.

  [Abstract] A method is proposed for construction of 
multiplex systems of fiber-optical interferometric sensors 
entirely without optical directional couplers. In these systems, 
the signal waves are formed by reflecting a portion of the 
radiation, propagating in the fiber lightguide, from semi- 
transparent mirrors, built within it, or from the internal 
nonhomogenieties of the lightguide itself. When they arrive back 
into the laser cavity, the lasing amplitude changes. Small 
changes in the length of the optical path in the lightguide, 
caused by the physical effects, which are being examined, can be 
detected by controlling the laser output. Theoretical 
relationships are developed for a frequency-modulated laser with 
optical feedback and the carrier frequency modulation method for 
multiplex sensors is discussed. Modulation characteristics of a 
He-Ne laser, the bistability of the longitudinal modes are 
examined and the effect of cross-talk is estimated. Autodyne 
multiplex sensors including underwater acoustics antenna and 
temperature sensors are also briefly discussed. The experimental 
study of frequency-scanned He-Ne-laser operating with different 
lightguide systems demonstrated that an autodyne detection is 
suitable for application with distributed sensors employing a 
Rayleigh scattering signal. Figures 9,references 12: 4 Russian,

<LEADPARA>  Scientists at AT&amp;T's Bell Laboratories announced Thursday that they had

<HEADLINE>  TINY LASERS MAY SPEED UP COMPUTERS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     The same technology may also have other promising applications, including
building sensitive artificial-vision systems that could operate in a manner
similar to the human retina, researchers said.;   The <ORGANIZATION>Bell Labs</ORGANIZATION> research team
presented its work <DATE>Thursday</DATE> in <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION> at the annual meeting of the <ORGANIZATION>Optical
Society of America.</ORGANIZATION>;   Part of the report's significance is that the new
lasers -- which look like microscopic thumbtacks whose round tops emit
piercing beams of light -- can be made in arrays by the same process that is
used to make modern semiconductors.;   Thus the researchers said they believed
that optical computers, which exist today only in theory, might some day be
able to follow the same falling cost curves that have been emblematic of the
microelectronics industry.;   "We're hoping that when you get to computing
speeds above a billion cycles per second that optics will play a major part,"
said <PERSON>Richart Slusher</PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION>Bell Labs Optical Physics Research
Department</ORGANIZATION>. "The key is whether these technologies will be cost effective.";  
The new lasers are made by alternating one or more layers of indium gallium
arsenide with layers of indium gallium arsenide phosphide. The thin layers
that constitute the laser head are only 400 atoms thick. The researchers then
etch away some material to leave the tiny thumbtack-shaped structures that can
emit laser light in several directions.;   So far, prototypes of tiny lasers
that are 2, 5 and 10 microns in diameter have been manufactured using the new
process. By comparison, a human hair is approximately 75 microns in diameter
and a conventional laser beam used to play a compact disk player is 250
microns in diameter.;   The new semiconductor laser was designed by <PERSON>Sam
McCall</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Bell Labs</ORGANIZATION> physicist.;   The researchers said that they would now
attempt a second key technological step: designing photon "wires" to guide the
beams emitted by the lasers.;   By building circuits of optical lasers and
other components, the researchers said they hoped to be able to fabricate
systems that would permit computer designers to create reliable connections
between computer chips in high-speed systems.;   The new lasers operate at
extremely low power levels and therefore would be well-suited as light sources
for future optical switches, the researchers said.  </TEXT>

<FÊP=106> [Article by <PERSON>Peter Rodgers</PERSON>: "FELIX Opens for Business"] </F>
  [Text] <LOCATION>United Kingdom</LOCATION> researchers are to receive <PERCENT>20 
percent</PERCENT> of the beam time on the FELIX free electron laser at the 
<ORGANIZATION>Dutch Institute for Plasma Physics</ORGANIZATION> "Rijnhuizen" in <DATE>Nieuwegein</DATE> 
for the next two years. The agreement was signed at the 
inauguration of FELIX <DATE>last month</DATE> and the beam time is payment in 
kind for two <ORGANIZATION>United</ORGANIZATION> Kingdom-built undulators. The undulators 
were intended for a British free electron laser project that was 
cancelled in <DATE>1987</DATE>. The Rijnhuizen laboratory is part of the 
<ORGANIZATION>Foundation for Fundamental Research on Matter</ORGANIZATION> (FOM). 
  Work on FELIX started in <DATE>1987</DATE>. The <ORGANIZATION>Dutch Ministry of 
Education and Science</ORGANIZATION> paid <MONEY>13.4 million Dutch guilders</MONEY> [FL] 
(about 5.7 million pounds) capital costs and is spending another 
FL4 million per year to turn FELIX into an international user 
facility - the agreement with the <LOCATION>United Kingdom</LOCATION> is the first 
step. FELIX actually started operating in <DATE>1991</DATE> and the first 
experiments started late in <DATE>1992</DATE>. According to FELIX project 
leader Wim van <LOCATION>Amersfoort</LOCATION>, the facility is oversubscribed by 
more than a factor of two. The plan is to operate FELIX 42 
weeks of the year (16 hours a day, five days per week) and the 
annual running costs are expected to be about FL3.5 million. 
  A free electron laser (FEL) is a cross between a synchrotron 
and a laser. Synchrotron radiation is produced when a beam of 
relativistic electrons is forced to oscillate in a magnetic 
field. The core of a FEL is an undulator, a device that produces 
more intense synchrotron radiation than other arrangements of 
magnets. If mirrors are placed at each end of the undulator, the 
radiation can be stored in the resulting cavity and made 
coherent. Bunched electrons travel through the undulator, 
amplifying radiation produced by previous bunches. One of the 
mirrors is partially reflecting to allow the <ORGANIZATION>FEL</ORGANIZATION> radiation to 
escape from the cavity. 
  FELIX operates between 6 and 110 microns in the infrared and 
is used for experiments in atomic physics, molecular physics and 
chemistry, solid-state physics, surface physics and chemistry, 
medicine and biomolecular spectroscopy. The wavelength is tuned 
by changing the electron energy or the magnetic field in the 
undulator. It is tunability over a wide range of wavelengths 
that give FELs their advantage over other radiation sources. 
  FELIX actually has two undulators and two linear 
accelerators. Its output consists of micropulses - infrared 
pulses with durations between 0.5 and 10 picoseconds and peak 
powers of 10 megawatts. The micropulses are separated by 1 
nanosecond and form macropulses which can last as long as 6 
microseconds and contain thousands of micropulses. There are 
between six and ten macropulses per second. 
  Twenty percent of the time on FELIX will be used for 
studying 
FELs themselves. The <ORGANIZATION>FOM</ORGANIZATION> group plans to produce micropulses 
with durations of hundreds of femtoseconds and to extend the 
wavelength range to 300 microns - shorter wavelengths in the 1 
to 20 microns range are already covered by the CLIO free 
electron laser at Orsay in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>. 
  Rijnhuizen has also started work on a free electron maser 
(FEM) as a megawatt source of tunable millimetre waves. This 
would be used to heat and control magnetically-confined fusion 
plasmas in tokamaks. Completion of the <ORGANIZATION>FEM</ORGANIZATION> project, which is 
being carried out in collaboration with laboratories in the 
former <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>, is expected in <DATE>1995</DATE>.

  Key words: spacecraft, nuclear power plant, heat emitting

  According to estimates, as a result of accidental and in 
many 
cases intentional exhausts there are now over 3.5 million 
artificial objects and particles in the circumterrestrial layer 
of outer space. Such a cosmic ``debris'' presents a danger to 
astronauts as well as to spacecraft. 
  Passive methods and active methods of cleaning outer space 
of 
this debris are now being investigated. Removal of debris 
fragments by active methods requires use of devices which detect 
particles and impart either energy or momentum to them so as to 
ensure their deceleration and descent from the orbit. This 
problem can be solved in a cardinal way, namely by vaporization 
of fragments with the aid of high-energy systems. Such a system 
may be a spacecraft which carries an electric reaction engine 
which propels it, a nuclear power plant which supplies power to 
the engine, and a laser set which imparts energy to a particle 
in space. 
  Under consideration is the possibility of using for this 
purpose a spacecraft which carries a nuclear power plant 
consisting of a heat emitting reactor-converter and a built-in 
laser set with nuclear pumping /1/. 
  The basal nuclear power plant has the following main 
technical and technological characteristics /2/: 
  1. Use of heat emitting fast-neutron reactor-converter with 
a 
moderating reflector and with an emitter shell formed by 
tungsten single crystals. 
  2. Use of a high-temperature cooling system with lithium as 
the coolant. 
  3. Transmission of the heat ejected during the thermodynamic 
cycle through the surface of a cooler-radiator consisting of 
sodium heat exchanger tubes. 
  4. Use of only one structural material, a niobium alloy, 
throughout the entire nuclear power plant. 
  5. Layout of the nuclear power plant based on the radiation 
path principle, with use of shadow-type radiation protection. 
  One envisages a compound reactor regulation system 
consisting 
of rotating cylinders inside the lateral reflector in addition 
to control elements and protective devices ensuring radiation 
safety directly inside the reactor-converter core. Inside the 
core is also located a protective nuclear safety system 
consisting of devices which absorb neutrons and ensuring nuclear 
safety in all emergency situations, these devices being 
withdrawn from the core into their functional orbit only before 
the power is turned on. The nuclear power plant is both started 
and cooled by a startup cooling system which ensures economical 
melting of lithium in the tubes by the heat coming from the 
reactor-converter during startup. 
  An array of laser cells is mounted in the lateral reflector 
of the heat emitting reactor-converter, its electric power 
rating being 150 kw. The reactor generates both the voltage 
necessary for sustaining the discharge in the discharge chamber 
of the <ORGANIZATION>CO</ORGANIZATION>[.sub]2[/]-laser and the neutron flux used for 
boost-excitation of the active laser medium. Each cell is a 
discharge chamber, a 700 mm long cylindrical tube 110 mm in 
diameter, its geometrical axis coinciding with optical axis of 
the laser. The electrodes are disposed along that optical axis 
and produce a transverse discharge, perpendicular to the 
direction of gas flow. The active medium is a 
CO[.sub]2[/]-N[.sub]2[/]-He mixture driven through the 
discharge tube, its temperature and pressure at the inlet being 
500 K and <DATE>4500</DATE> Pa respectively. A laser set with an exit beam 
power of 15 kw requires 10 such cells inside the lateral 
reflector. The cells can be cooled either by an independent 
cooling system or by a cooling system combined with the cooling 
system for the protective shields. It is also feasible to use a 
cooling system withe heat exchanger tubes. 
  Design estimates indicate that the mass of such a nuclear 
power plant with an electric power rating of 150 kw will not 
exceed nine tons. 
  Estimates regarding the effectiveness radius of such a power 
plant indicate the following. Inasmuch as most of the artificial 
objects in outer space are made of aluminum and are within the 
0.1-10 mm size range, they require correspondingly 0.00023-200 
kJ of energy for vaporization. 
  Owing to divergence of the laser beam, the intensity of 
radiation reaching the surface of a particle will depend on the 
distance to that surface. The intensity of radiation incident on 
a particle is 

<FIGÊID=JPRS-UST-005L-17A>      FORMULA </FIG>


  The intensity levels (watts) of incident radiation from a 15 
kW laser, depending on the radius of a particle (cm) and on the 
distance to a particle (km), are listed is the Table. The 
numbers in parentheses represent the time (seconds) needed for 
vaporization of a particle: 

<FIGÊID=JPRS-UST-005L-17B>      FORMULA </FIG>


  Evidently such a system is very effective at least within 
the 
10-30 km range of distances. 
  Such systems operate now in radiation-safe orbits within the 
800-2000 km range of altitudes, where most of the mass of debris 
fragments is located. The rocket-carrier ``Proton'' puts a 
spacecraft with a dry mass of 11.2 tons into a circular orbit at 
800 km altitude, whereupon the nuclear power plant on the 
spacecraft is turned on so that search for and vaporization of 
particles can begin. The spacecraft then moves from 800 km to 
<DATE>2000</DATE> km altitude and back to 800 km altitude with an only small 
change of the orbit inclination angle, propelled by the 150 kW 
electric reaction engine with xenon as the working medium. It 
takes the spacecraft about 960 h to make one such sweep and, 
with a 5-6 tons supply of xenon, it can make 40-50 sweeps during 
its 5 years long life. Complete removal of fragments within the 
800-2000 km layer requires 8-10 such spacecrafts.

  [Abstract] Electron-beam pumping of the wide-aperture 
excimer laser ``GARPUN'' [HARPOON] is being studied in search of 
a scheme which will ensure most efficient and nearly uniform 
excitation of the active medium. This laser, inside a 144 cm 
long chamber with a 22x22 cm[.sup]2[/] large square 
cross-section and a 18x20 cm[.sup]2[/] wide aperture, is 
pulse- pumped by two relativistic electron beams entering 
laterally from opposite sides through vacuum-sealed windows made 
of 20 ?m thick titanium foil, which separates the gaseous 
working medium inside from the beam accelerating vacuum diodes 
outside. The high-voltage beam accelerators consist each of four 
duplex shaping lines on deionized water which are electrically 
charged by a generator of voltage pulses. A pair of solenoids 
produces a pulsed magnetic field of about 1 kG intensity 
parallel to the counterpropagating electron beams which 
stabilizes the beams and minimizes diffusion of electrons from 
the active medium. This arrangement makes it feasible to form 
electron beams 12x100 cm[.sup]2[/] in cross-section carrying 
a uniformly distributed current of 60 kA behind the windows and 
delivering it in square pulses of 100 ns duration. The 
accelerating voltage is regulated by varying either the voltage 
of pulse generator or the geometry of interelectode gap in the 
vacuum diodes. The experimental apparatus includes a graphite 
calorimeter measuring the energy of both electron beams at the 
entrance to the laser chamber and a DMI-1 magnetic inductive 
instrument recording the pressure pulses in the active medium 
through an 8ANCh-23 strain-gage transducer on an S8-14 
oscillograph, the time constant of this set being 0.3 ms and 
thus much shorter than the about 200 ms long pressure transient 
inside the laser chamber. Tests were performed with 
Ar*[.sub]2[/] and Kr*[.sub]2[/] molecules, 0.1-0<PERCENT>.6%</PERCENT> 
CO[.sub]2[/] being added for effective quenching of the 
excitation states. The theoretical model of electron transfer in 
the one-particle approximation disregards collective effects and 
plasma instabilities, all being negligible under conditions of 
the experiment. Only pairwise collisions of electrons with atoms 
of the noble gas are thus assumed to take places during electron 
beam and active medium interaction, in the course of which 
either the atoms become ionized (excited) by the electrons or 
electrons are being scattered by the atoms. Radiation losses 
attending elastic scattering are in this case also negligible. 
Analysis of this process requires calculating the trajectories 
of individual electrons between successive collisions with atoms 
by solving the equations of motion dP/dt = e[vB] and dS/dt = v 
(momentum P= m[.sub]e[/]v/[1- 
(v/c)[.sup]2[/]][.sup]1/2[/], S- distance traveled by 
electron, e- electron charge, B- magnetic induction, 
m[.sub]e[/]- electron mass, v- velocity of electron, c- speed 
of light, t- time). This system of equations has been solved 
numerically by the universally applicable and most precise of 
all <ORGANIZATION>Monte Carlo</ORGANIZATION> method. The results of the experiment and of the 
numerical simulation indicate the optimum conditions for pumping 
an energy of as much as 2.1 kJ and correspondingly a power of 
about 0.8 MW/cm[.sup]3[/] density into a ``Garpun'' Ar-laser 
with an about <PERCENT>60%</PERCENT> efficiency, with the energy 
distribution over 
the aperture deviating less than <PERCENT>20%</PERCENT> from a uniform one 
and the 
overall pump efficiency reaching about <PERCENT>16%</PERCENT>. The authors 
thank 
<PERSON>E.A. Molodykh</PERSON> for setting up he numerical calculations, <PERSON>A.A. 
Ionin</PERSON> and <PERSON>A.A. Kotkov</PERSON> for supplying the experimental apparatus 
and setting up the pressure measurements, <PERSON>V.G. Bakayev</PERSON> and <PERSON>G.V.

  [Text] <ORGANIZATION>Mitsubishi Electric</ORGANIZATION> has developed short-wavelength, 
high-output oscillation technology using a solid-state YAG 
laser. It was difficult to obtain the high-output 
short-wavelength laser light because the wavelength conversion 
element, which transforms the <ORGANIZATION>YAG</ORGANIZATION> laser light (infrared light) 
into short-wavelength light, tends to cause crystal destruction. 
The company avoided crystal destruction by bringing about a 
``gentle frequency conversion.'' It achieved this by lengthening 
the frequency conversion element and increasing the optical beam 
size of the <ORGANIZATION>YAG</ORGANIZATION> laser by an order of millimeters 10 times that 
of conventional types. Using this technology, <ORGANIZATION>Mitsubishi</ORGANIZATION> 
achieved the oscillation of 24 watt green laser light. 
Furthermore, it is said that not only green laser light but also 
blue laser light and other high output oscillations are possible. 
  The solid state laser which oscillates short-wavelength 
laser 
light consists of an excitation light source, a YAG laser (a 
yttrium-aluminum-garnet laser doped with niobium), a nonlinear 
optical material which is the wavelength conversion element, and 
other components. The excited YAG laser emits <DATE>1064</DATE> nanometer 
infrared light which, after passing through the wavelength 
conversion element, oscillates green, blue and other 
short-wavelength light. However, the wavelength conversion 
element crystal was too brittle to withstand the strong infrared 
light. 
  The company enlarged the spot size of the infrared light 
entering the wavelength conversion element by an order of 
millimeters for the purpose of dispersing the energy and, at the 
same time, it lengthened the wavelength conversion element. 
Several crystals were connected together because the maximum 
size for the wavelength conversion element crystal is 10 
millimeters. The optimal phase matching of their adjoining parts 
has been designed in order to minimize conversion loss. 
Accordingly, even when high output infrared radiation enters, 
the destruction of the wavelength conversion element crystal 
does not occur. 
  Employing this technology, and using a <ORGANIZATION>KTP</ORGANIZATION> (potassium 
titanate phosphate) wavelength conversion element which halves 
the wavelength, a 24 watt (electric power input 4.9 kilowatts) 
green laser light (532 nanometer wavelength) generation was 
attained. This is double the output achieved up until the 
present time and it is said that it is possible to have an 
output of more than 100 watts. Moreover, this technology can be 
applied to other wave conversion elements, such as 
<ORGANIZATION>KNb</ORGANIZATION>&lt;inf&gt; 3&lt;/inf&gt;  (potassium niobium&lt;inf&gt; 3&lt;/inf&gt; ) which converts 
the wavelength to one third -- a blue wavelength.

  [Abstract] The widening gap between the physical and 
engineering base of the construction industry and today's 
standards, the low mechanization level of roofing operations, 
and the increasing popularity of soft bitumen-based materials 
prompted the <ORGANIZATION>National Scientific Research Institute of Polymer 
Building Materials</ORGANIZATION> together with the <ORGANIZATION>Tekhnopom National 
Scientific and Engineering Center</ORGANIZATION> to examine the effectiveness 
of shaped cutting of rolled bitumen-impregnated roofing 
materials using a specialized laser system. To this end, <ORGANIZATION>CW</ORGANIZATION>, 
pulse, and periodic pulse CO[.sup]2[/], garnet, ruby, and 
Nd-glass lasers are tested. The experiment demonstrates that 
CO[.sup]2[/] <ORGANIZATION>CW</ORGANIZATION> lasers with a 1-6 kgf/cm[.sup]2[/] air 
injection to the cutting zone are optimum for materials moving 
at a high velocity relative to the beam. A comparison of laser, 
mechanical, and combined laser-mechanical cutting methods and 
process parameters makes it possible to speculate that a 36.9 
m/min cutting speed can be obtained using a 5 kW laser whose 
radiation is split into two beams. The advantages of a 
computer-aided laser cutting system include the simplicity and 
speed of switching from one standard size of material to 
another. The findings confirm the outlook for using laser 
radiation for shaped cutting of soft bitumen-impregnated roofing 
materials and the method's ability to implement complex designer 
concepts and original shapes for various building roof shapes. 
The anticipated economic impact from implementing the 
computer-aided laser complex using the combined laser-mechanical 
method with a double-split beam and three knives is up to 10 
million rubles in <DATE>1993</DATE> prices. References 4.

   SCHENECTADY -- General Electric Co. researchers said they
produced a high-powered beam of green light from a beam of
infrared light generated by a solid-state laser.
   The feat showed that a trick called frequency doubling
might be used to get high-powered, high-quality beams of
various colors of light from a solid-state laser. The power
and quality of the beams could lead to new applications of
solid-state lasers in medicine, communications and
manufacturing, the company said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Powerful beams of green light have been produced
previously, but by gas lasers, explained <PERSON>Michael H.
McLaughlin</PERSON>, manager of laser technology at <ORGANIZATION>GE</ORGANIZATION>'s big research
and development center here. Solid-state lasers have the
advantage of being smaller and more compact and thus more
amenable to various applications. But until now, beams of
green light from solid-state lasers have been relatively weak
and there have been some questions of whether it is possible
to use the frequency-doubling trick to produce high-powered
beams of light from solid-state lasers.
   To get a powerful beam of green light, the <ORGANIZATION>GE</ORGANIZATION> researchers
said they started with a 16-watt beam of invisible infrared
light from a solid-state laser. The beam was fed into a
so-called face-pumped laser that pumped up the power of the
beam to 92 watts.
   In the next step, the 92-watt beam was focused on a
crystal of lithium triborate which doubled the frequency of
part of the beam, jumping it into the green part of the light
spectrum from the infrared. The power of the green beam was
52 watts, or twice as powerful as green beams previously
produced by solid-state lasers, <ORGANIZATION>GE</ORGANIZATION> said. Moreover, the green
beam was of "good quality," meaning it tended to stay narrow
and steady.
   Green light is easily absorbed by certain plastic
composites and thus the more powerful beam might be useful in
machining such composites, the company said. Green light also
passes easily through seawater and thus such lasers might be
useful for submarine communications.
   "With additional frequency conversions, we can shift the
green beam to wavelengths in the ultraviolet and deep
ultraviolet regions useful for laser surgery and other
medical applications while retaining substantial average
power," <PERSON>Mr. McLaughlin</PERSON> said.

   Reasonable Facsimiles
   Of Fax Machines
                                                                                                       

   YOU DON'T need a fax machine to send and receive faxes. In
fact, you may be able to do much or all of your faxing from
your desk, using equipment you already own: a personal
computer and laser printer.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A growing array of add-on products give computers and
printers faxing ability. Depending on your needs, PCs and
printers can replace, or at least supplement, stand-alone fax
machines. Properly equipped, they can mimic the three main
parts of fax machines: a mechanism for scanning documents to
be faxed, a special built-in phone for sending or receiving
images of documents, and a printing mechanism for reproducing
faxes on paper.
   There are limitations to faxing without fax machines. The
biggest drawback is that most setups can only send
computerized documents, not paper ones. But on the receiving
end, you have the pleasure of being free from greasy, curly
fax paper. You can simply read faxes on the screen, or print
them out on regular paper using your computer's laser
printer.
   The most popular faxing device for computers is a fax
modem. These products combine, in one unit, a standard modem
-- the specialized phones that send and receive computer data
-- and the telephonic guts of a fax machine.
   To transmit a fax with these devices, you use special
software to send an electronic document through the fax modem
to a regular fax machine elsewhere. When someone sends a fax
to you from a fax machine, the fax modem answers the call and
turns the transmission into a computer graphic image that can
be displayed on your screen or printed on your laser printer
(but would require massaging before it could be edited in
your word processor).
   I've tried two fax modems: the <MONEY>$179</MONEY> Fax96 1-Liner by
Frecom, of <LOCATION>Fremont</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, for my IBM-compatible PC; and the
<MONEY>$269</MONEY> DoveFax, by <ORGANIZATION>Dove Computer</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Wilmington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.C.</LOCATION>, for my
Macintosh computer. Both work well, but there are many
others.
                                                                                                       

   Before choosing a fax modem, consider the software it
includes. The software should be easy to use and install, and
should let you maintain an automated phone list for quick and
simple sending, view and manipulate incoming faxes and create
customized cover pages.
   Dove's software and other Macintosh faxing programs allow
you to fax documents directly from word processors or other
programs by going through the same steps you would to print
the document but selecting the fax modem as your "printer."
An impressive <MONEY>$75</MONEY> program called <ORGANIZATION>Winfax</ORGANIZATION>, from <ORGANIZATION>Delrina
Technology</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Toronto</LOCATION>, lets you do the same thing on
IBM-compatible computers running <ORGANIZATION>Microsoft</ORGANIZATION>'s Windows program.
   Some fax programs have special features. The Fax96 modem's
software automatically determines whether an incoming call is
a regular voice phone call, a fax call or a standard computer
data transmission. Calera Recognition Systems, <LOCATION>Sunnyvale</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, offers a <MONEY>$99</MONEY> Windows program called FaxGrabber that
automatically turns faxes being received by a fax modem into
text that can be edited in your word processor.
   A key advantage of using your computer as a fax machine is
that you can simply look at faxes on the screen and delete
the ones you don't want without wasting time or paper by
printing them. But a disadvantage is that, if you receive a
lot of faxes, they can hog your computer's memory and disk
storage space.
                                                                                                       

   One solution is to buy an add-on device that turns a laser
printer into a stand-alone fax machine, without requiring
incoming faxes to go through your computer. The <ORGANIZATION>JetFax</ORGANIZATION> II by
<ORGANIZATION>JetFax</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Menlo Park</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, was an early entry in this
market. A slender box, it sits beside a <ORGANIZATION>Hewlett-Packard</ORGANIZATION>
LaserJet or compatible printer and automatically routes
incoming faxes to the printer. H-P now offers its own
competing fax add-on, a bigger unit called the LaserJet Fax.
Both devices can send computer files as faxes, but the <ORGANIZATION>H-P</ORGANIZATION>
can also send paper documents.
   These two products are relatively costly (around <MONEY>$700</MONEY> for
the <ORGANIZATION>JetFax II</ORGANIZATION>, nearly <MONEY>$1,000</MONEY> for the LaserJet Fax). Tall Tree
Systems of <LOCATION>Palo Alto</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, offers a compact, <MONEY>$399</MONEY>
alternative called Fax-O-Matic. This little black box merely
lets an H-P or compatible laser printer receive faxes,
without the involvement of the computer. Extended Systems of
<LOCATION>Boise</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION>, makes a <MONEY>$599</MONEY> device, the FaxConnection, that
goes inside an <ORGANIZATION>H-P</ORGANIZATION> laser printer to enable it to receive
faxes.
   The most elegant solution is the LaserScript Fax by <ORGANIZATION>Everex
Systems</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Fremont</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif</LOCATION>. This is a laser printer with
built-in fax circuitry. It will automatically receive faxes
and let you send faxes from the computer. LaserScript Fax
sells for <MONEY>$2,500</MONEY> to <MONEY>$3,000</MONEY>. Eventually, I suspect, most laser
printer makers will offer built-in faxing like this, further
eroding the need for separate fax machines, and that awful
fax paper.
                                                                                                       

   ADDENDUM: A few weeks back, I glibly described internal
modems as "sheets of silicon" with chips mounted on them. A
couple of eagle-eyed readers pointed out that the main part
of the modem isn't made of silicon, only the chips. I stand
corrected.

   Toshiba Corp. announced that researchers at its Toshiba
R&amp;D Center have developed a prototype red-light semiconductor
laser, or laser diode, with the highest optical output power
of any continuous-wave visible laser diode in the world.
   The new prototype device is expected to be used as a new
light source for optical information storage products,
replacing conventional semiconductor lasers, Toshiba said in
Tokyo.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The new device emits a laser with a maximum optical output
power of 106 milliwatts, or mW, at a wavelength of 690
nanometers, or nm. Conventional devices, used as light
sources to read and write data for storage products such as
electronic document filing systems and CD-ROMs, emit an
invisible laser beam with 30mW of output power and an 830nm
wavelength.
   <ORGANIZATION>Toshiba</ORGANIZATION> said demand is increasing for devices with higher
output power and a shorter wavelength in order to store data
at a higher density and read the data more accurately. The
higher the density becomes, the more power is required for
writing and reading data.

<TEXT>     Color laser printers today are far too costly (<MONEY>$30,000</MONEY> and up) for personal
use. But even these expensive color laser printers can't give you colored
foil-like text. LaserColor does, and does it for pennies. Here's how.;   
LaserColor's <MONEY>$14.95</MONEY> MultiColor Pac contains 10 metallic-color sheets of heat-
and pressure-sensitive film. The film has a patented adhesive that bonds only
to dry toner, the powdered ink used by laser printers and most copying
machines.;    Starting with a printed page from your laser printer or copier,
cut a piece of the film large enough to cover the text or image you want to
color. Then tape the film to the paper with the provided adhesive dots.;   
Next, run the document and the attached film through the laser printer or
copier using the single sheet feed or manual tray. The heat and pressure
activate the film's adhesive, and the metallic color will stick only to the
printed areas.;    Once the paper has passed through the machine, you peel off
the film and adhesive dots. The result is a colored, near-mirror finish added
to the text or image you selected.;    For more information and a free sample,

  [Abstract] The performance of a two-frequency YAG:Nd+++ 
laser with beat (frequency separation) modulation for 
communication systems and rangefinders is analyzed 
theoretically, assuming equal quality factors in both modes and 
a uniformly broadened amplification band when the gain excess 
over the the sum of cavity and exit mirror losses remains small. 
For specificity is considered a laser with the following 
parameters: half-width of upper level _g_= 3 kHz, unilateral 
half-width of amplification band &Ggr;= 200 GHz, normalized 
pumping rate _ee_= 1.0225, absolute frequency deviation D= 1 
GHz. 
The system of equations of kinetics has been solved numerically 
for the population inversion in each mode, the intensity of each 
mode, and the beat frequency as explicit functions of time in 
the case of linear sawtooth frequency modulation of one mode. 
With the aid of these data is now calculated the form of a 
compressed pulse and thus also its nonlinearity, whereupon the 
results are used for the design of a matching filter or 
correlational signal processor. The resolving power of a 
rangefinder operating with one such two-frequency laser is found 
to be theoretically the same as that of a rangefinder operating 
with two single-frequency lasers. Practically, however, it is 
much higher owing to the fact that here technical fluctuations 
are correlated and especially so at a 10[.sup]6[/] GHz/s or 
higher scanning rate with a pulse signal shortened to an 
approximately 5 ns duration. Figures 4; references 6.

  [Abstract] Research done during the 1969-1991 period 
concerning the physical mechanisms of laser-induced plasma 
formation above solid targets is reviewed, formation of 
low-temperature surface plasma by interaction of laser radiation 
and solid targets covering the 10[.sup]5[/]-10[.sup]10[/] 
range of radiation intensity being essentially considered here 
along with negative and positive technological aspects of the 
process. The results of experiments with pulsed 
CO[.sub]2[/]-lasers indicate that formation of a plasma above 
metal surfaces in air requires a radiation of only about 10 
MW/cm[.sup]2[/] intensity in pulses of about 1 ?s duration 
and of only 0.1-1 MW/cm[.sup]2[/] intensity in millisecond 
pulses, while breaking down air in the absence of metal surfaces 
requires as much as 1-10 GW/cm[.sup]2[/]. Two characteristic 
target temperatures have been defined as parameters of the 
initial thermal interaction: temperature T* of complete 
vaporization and temperature T[.sub]b[/] of boiling or 
sublimation under a given pressure of the ambient gas. The 
energy relations during thermal stage of target heating to 
vaporization and the subsequent stage of vapor ionization are 
examined theoretically with the support of experimental data, 
for the purpose of determining the threshold laser radiation 
intensity and the threshold energy density at the target 
surface. Inasmuch as both threshold depend on the mode of 
surface plasma formation, the following ones are considered 
here: S- by heating of the entire target surface, MD- by heating 
of thermally insulated microdefects, A- by heating and 
vaporization of aerosol, VGM- by ionization of the target vapor 
mixed with ambient gas in the diffusion mode, EF- 
hydrodynamically in the presence of an erosion flare. The review 
covers plasma formation in these modes above ideally smooth 
surfaces of many metals ranging from fusible ones (Zn,Pb) to 
refractory ones (W,Ta) including brass, also of carbon and 
several oxides (alumina, silica), above surfaces of 
nonhomogeneous materials such as aluminum alloys with solid 
inclusions of intermetallic compounds, above microdefective 
surfaces, and above rough surfaces. Analysis of surface plasma 
formation in vapor-gas mixtures in the diffusion mode after 
heating of the entire target surface (S-VGM) are considered two 
models: quasi-steady vapor distribution within a cloud of finite 
dimensions and nonsteady vapor distribution within a cloud in 
statu nascendi, atomic and molecular ambient gases being 
considered. Analysis of surface plasma in the hydrodynamic mode 
in the presence of an erosion flare is based on the model of 
vapor breakdown by a ``heat absorption spike'' or the model of 
``avalanche ionization'' in gas layers at the target surface. 
Despite the subjectivity of researchers and not always 
consistent research data, the thresholds of surface plasma 
formation by laser radiation pulses have been in many cases 
correctly estimated. Figures 15; tables 5; references 155.

Laser Maker's Success
Exemplifies the Progress

<TEXT>
    <PERSON>Samuel Simonsson</PERSON> has just
returned from a trip to <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>. In a few minutes he will meet
with customers from <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>. In a few hours he is leaving for
<LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Mr. Simonsson</PERSON> makes lasers, and these days demand is about as hot as the light beam itself. 
<ORGANIZATION>Rofin-Sinar Laser G.m.b.H.</ORGANIZATION>, which built its first laser only <DATE>four years ago</DATE>, already is the world's No. 3 producer of industrial lasers. 
It has sold more than 300 custom-built machines to customers in 23 countries; sales have advanced <PERCENT>70%</PERCENT> annually for several years. 

   Such success wouldn't have seemed probable a few years ago for any start-up venture in <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION>, much less one in the vanguard of high technology. 
From government ministries to corporate boardrooms, Germans sensed they were falling behind the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> in the global race for technological leadership. 

   But as <ORGANIZATION>Rofin-Sinar</ORGANIZATION>'s sudden rise suggests, that technology gap may be closing. 
In such highly advanced technologies as lasers, high-energy and nuclear physics and pharmaceutical research, <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> now matches or surpasses <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, technology experts say. 

   "Five or six years ago, the Germans were buying other people's lasers. 
Now they're the world's leaders," says <PERSON>David Belforte</PERSON>, an industry consultant in <LOCATION>Sturbridge</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass</LOCATION>. 
"The technology they have introduced is very impressive." 
<LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>'s funding of laser research, he adds, "far exceeds the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and perhaps even <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> combined." 

   Of course, German technology is woefully inadequate in several fields, most notably microelectronics and computers. 
Moreover, the success of many joint European projects, which aim in particular to shore up the continent's low standing in electronics, won't be known for years. 

   Still, German scientists won the Nobel Prize for physics this year and last, <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>'s first back-to-back selection in the category since <DATE>1919</DATE>. 
Total government and private research spending has risen nearly <PERCENT>20%</PERCENT> in the past three years, to the equivalent of <MONEY>$27.3 billion</MONEY>, the highest proportion of research spending to gross national product of any nation. 

   And in its latest "World Competitiveness Report," the <ORGANIZATION>European Management Forum</ORGANIZATION>, a Swiss research firm, rates West German industry's technological effort as second in the world -- behind <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> but ahead of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, which dropped to fifth place from second in this year's rankings. 

   "There's a wide range of German industry that is competitive technologically," says <PERSON>Thomas Rauschenbach</PERSON>, who wrote the study. 

   In the case of lasers, German industry is not only competitive but is widely believed to be leading the pack. 
That leadership in part reflects the government's own recognition that lasers are an important future technology that builds on German strengths in fields such as optics, precision equipment and physics, and should therefore be nurtured. 

   As much as <PERCENT>20%</PERCENT> of <ORGANIZATION>Rofin-Sinar</ORGANIZATION>'s research budget is federally funded. 
Of the 72 projects under <LOCATION>Western Europe</LOCATION>'s Eureka research-support umbrella, the second largest is the so-called Eurolaser program. 
About <PERCENT>40%</PERCENT> of its <MONEY>$205 million</MONEY> support comes from the <LOCATION>Bonn</LOCATION> government. 

   While President <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> envisions bold uses for the laser in his proposed space-based missile-defense system, the Germans think nonmilitary applications have the most potential. 
Though world-wide sales of all types of lasers will barely exceed <MONEY>$500 million</MONEY> this year, the laser already is an essential tool. 

   German companies are heavily involved. 
The electronics giant <ORGANIZATION>Siemens AG</ORGANIZATION> supplies more than one-third of the world's supermarket checkout scanners. 
Tiny <ORGANIZATION>Lambda Physik G.m.b.H. of Goettingen</ORGANIZATION> makes <PERCENT>70%</PERCENT> of the world's excimer lasers, used to perform delicate surgery. 
And in factory automation, powerful <ORGANIZATION>Rofin-Sinar</ORGANIZATION> lasers are used to cut, weld and anneal many materials, replacing traditional processes. 

   "Lasers won't replace spot welding," predicts <PERSON>Mr. Simonsson</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Rofin-Sinar</ORGANIZATION>'s boyish-looking 37-year-old president, "but they will take over many applications." 

   Born in <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION> and educated in <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Simonsson</PERSON> and two partners founded <ORGANIZATION>Rofin-Sinar</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1975</DATE> to sell other companies' lasers. 
Banks were reluctant to lend money to the new concern. 
In fact, the idea probably would have flopped without the backing of a venture capitalist, <PERSON>Eberhard Lohss</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Hamburg</LOCATION> businessman who holds a majority interest. 

   The new company also had trouble recruiting personnel. 
"People in <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> aren't as willing to take a professional risk," says <PERSON>Mr. Simonsson</PERSON>, an engineer by training. 
"When I was in college I was amazed how many people had a fixed idea about their careers. 
They already knew what pension they could expect." 

   But by <DATE>1982</DATE> the company had achieved enough success that <PERSON>Mr. Simonsson</PERSON> was convinced he could make better lasers than the ones he was peddling. 

   Even competitors thought the new machines had promise: <ORGANIZATION>Spectra-Physics Inc.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, the largest commercial laser manufacturer, bought rights to sell one early <ORGANIZATION>Rofin-Sinar</ORGANIZATION> design in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> 

   "American companies are living off the technology of others," says <PERSON>Robert McCrory</PERSON>, who directs laser research at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Rochester</ORGANIZATION>. 
"They aren't in the vanguard, pushing new applications." 
The Germans, on the other hand, are "very, very competitive," he adds. 

   Rofin-Sinar has been particularly aggressive in its commercial development of German scientific discoveries. 
One of the company's newest lasers, <PERSON>Mr. Simonsson</PERSON> explains proudly, can cut thick steel plates with a beam six times as intense as previous designs. 

   Yet the machine -- about the size of two stacked caskets -- consumes only twice as much gas. 
A new technique uses radio waves to generate the laser beam, a process developed by a nearby German university. 

   Elsewhere on the company's shop floor, workers are building some of the 100 lasers that <ORGANIZATION>Rofin-Sinar</ORGANIZATION> will produce this year, which range in price from <MONEY>$50,000</MONEY> to more than <MONEY>$1 million</MONEY>. 

   Yet even with its rapid growth, <ORGANIZATION>Rofin-Sinar</ORGANIZATION> is a midget among giants. 
SpectraPhysics's sales of <MONEY>$210 million</MONEY> in the year ended <DATE>Sept. 30</DATE> dwarf <ORGANIZATION>Rofin-Sinar</ORGANIZATION>'s projected <MONEY>$25 million</MONEY> for calendar <DATE>1986</DATE>. 
Still, <PERSON>Mr. Simonsson</PERSON> sees advantages to being small -- including being nimble enough to exploit market opportunities in a rapidly changing field. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Simonsson</PERSON> figures his company must have something going for it -- or the competition wouldn't be trying to buy him out. 
"We have an offer every two or three weeks," he says. 
"I'm trying to think of new ways to say no."

   Scientists at American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.'s Bell
Laboratories said they have developed the world's smallest
semiconductor lasers.
   AT&amp;T said the lasers are so tiny (about five microns in
diameter) that at least 10,000 would fit on the head of a
pin. AT&amp;T and its rivals have been racing to boost
transmission power of fiber-optic communications equipment
and to miniaturize devices that comprise such gear to reduce
cost and make them easier to service.

scientists must first show that the new devices can be made
as inexpensively as current electrical connectors and that
they are compatible with silicon-based electronic equipment,
he added.
   Pictures supplied by <ORGANIZATION>AT&amp;T</ORGANIZATION> show the microscopic devices,
dubbed "microdisk lasers," look like thumbtacks when viewed
through a scanning electron microscope. The head of each one
of these "tacks" is 400 atoms thick, or one-thousandth the
diameter of a human hair. <PERSON>Dr. Slusher</PERSON> said the devices are
<ORGANIZATION>Bell Labs</ORGANIZATION>' "biggest breakthrough" since so-called
surface-emitting lasers were developed about three years ago.
Such lasers use two microscopic mirrors to concentrate a
light beam on the laser chip's interior surface before
shooting the beam in the form of a cone.
   The new lasers were designed by <ORGANIZATION>Bell Labs</ORGANIZATION>' researcher <PERSON>Sam
McCall</PERSON> to operate in the so-called "whispering gallery" mode,
named for the sound effect associated with <ORGANIZATION>St. Paul's
Cathedral</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, where a person can whisper and be heard
clearly along the wall of the dome. In a similar fashion, <PERSON>Dr.
McCall</PERSON>'s lasers are said to shoot their light pulses or
photons along the edge of the disk-shaped laser, or the path
of least resistance, <ORGANIZATION>AT&amp;T</ORGANIZATION> said.
   Each laser, which is crafted of indium gallium arsenide
"sandwiched" between indium gallium arsenide phosphide, took
about nine months to develop, said <PERSON>Dr. Slusher</PERSON>, who noted
that <PERSON>Dr. McCall</PERSON> worked on the team that developed <ORGANIZATION>AT&amp;T</ORGANIZATION>'s
surface-emitting devices.

<FÊP=106> [Article by "JB": "Holographic Grating for Environmental </F>
Analysis and Laser Work. Optoelectronic Devices Can Become 
Smaller and Less Expensive/Resolution of 0.3 Nanometer"] 
  [Text] <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION>--Holographic gratings are optical 
microstructures that can be used in numerous ways in optical 
measuring systems and in laser equipment. The <ORGANIZATION>Berlin Institute 
for Optics GmbH</ORGANIZATION> [Limited Liability Company] (Rudower Chaussee 5, 
12484 <LOCATION>Berlin</LOCATION>) has developed new kinds of holographic gratings 
that can be used in spectrometers for environmental analysis and 
for optimization of the application of high-power lasers. 
  As <PERSON>Dr. Christel Budzinski</PERSON> reports, optical microstructures 
like holographic gratings can be fabricated by processes that 
come from microelectronics. They include photolithography and 
dry etching. Holographic gratings can help to reduce the size of 
optoelectronic devices. The cost of these devices can also be 
lowered by the use of gratings. 
  Spectrometers in the field of environmental analysis are an 
application possibility. Incident light is split up spectrally 
and analyzed in spectrometers. These instruments have to be 
especially lightweight and compact if they are used in 
satellites for remote sensing, for determination of the state of 
terrestrial vegetation, for example. 
  A grating from <LOCATION>Berlin</LOCATION> specially developed for this purpose 
can help here. The spectrometer required operates in the 
spectral region of 650 to 800 nanometers. An image of a strip of 
the earth's surface (swath) is formed by means of a lens in the 
entrance slit and is then directed to the grating, where the 
spectrum is split into individual colors. The spectrum is then 
picked up by a photodetector array (CCD) and can be analyzed. 
  Atmospheric gases and changes in them as well as the state 
of 
vegetation can be detected in this way by estimating the red 
shift of chlorophyll margins. The holographic grating is the 
chief component. It defines the precision of the measurements. 
The spectral resolution, that is, the precision with which 
individual wavelengths can be differentiated, is especially 
decisive. 
  The resolution comes to 0.3 nanometer for the grating 
developed for the remote-sensing spectrometer. This also enables 
the spatial resolution of measured values in a modified 
spectrometer. Thus, the values for a swath can be associated 
with individual elements of the earth's surface, and this 
enhances the strength of the evidence of environmental analysis. 
  Laser technology is an additional application possibility 
for 
holographic gratings. CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  lasers above all have 
recently taken on importance in medicine and in the working of 
materials. This type of laser is very efficient and can be 
handled with precision. 
  This precision is closely associated with the diameter of 
the 
laser spot. The smaller the diameter of the beam, the higher the 
energy density and the more finely detailed the work that can be 
done. Now holographic gratings can help to reduce the laser 
spot's size. However, conventional gratings fabricated by 
photolithography do not have especially high stress tolerance. 
  The gratings are ruined even at lower laser outputs. That is 
why the scientists in <LOCATION>Berlin</LOCATION> have fabricated holographic 
gratings by means of a molding process and with copper as the 
substrate. These gratings have substantially higher stress 
tolerance and thus can contribute to higher precision when 
working with high-power lasers.

   Compaq Computer Corp. is planning to produce laser
printers for PC networks in its first move outside the
personal-computer business, according to industry executives.
   The new products will put Compaq in competition with
industry rivals such as Hewlett-Packard Co., the leading
laser-printer maker, in a fast-growing market that accounted
for well over $1 billion in world-wide sales last year.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Industry executives said <ORGANIZATION>Compaq</ORGANIZATION> won't try to compete with
<PERSON>Hewlett</PERSON> in the huge mainstream market for smaller,
stand-alone laser printers. They added that though the
company has recruited executives for a printer division and
is setting up operations in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>, details
could still change before the machine's planned <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> debut in
<DATE>May</DATE>. <ORGANIZATION>Compaq</ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION>, has previously scotched
tentative plans to launch a laser-printer product line.
   In a telephone interview from <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Compaq</ORGANIZATION> Chief
Executive Officer <PERSON>Eckhard Pfeiffer</PERSON> declined to talk about the
company's efforts to produce laser printers.
   According to the industry executives, <ORGANIZATION>Compaq</ORGANIZATION>'s machines
are envisioned as head-to-head competitors for <ORGANIZATION>Hewlett</ORGANIZATION>'s
17-page-a-minute LaserJet IIIsi printer, the main contender
in a segment that is growing much faster than the general
market for laser printers. In <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, for example, sales of
12- to 19-page-a-minute laser printers grew <PERCENT>72%</PERCENT> to <MONEY>$340
million</MONEY> last year -- and are expected to continue growing at
a compound annual rate of <PERCENT>31%</PERCENT> for the next five years.
   In the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, the category exploded during <DATE>1991</DATE>, with
revenue almost quadrupling to <MONEY>$879 million</MONEY>, according to <ORGANIZATION>BIS</ORGANIZATION>
Strategic Decisions, a market research firm.
   For its new machines, <ORGANIZATION>Compaq</ORGANIZATION> would use a printer "engine"
made by <ORGANIZATION>Fuji Xerox Co.</ORGANIZATION>, a Japanese joint venture of <ORGANIZATION>Fuji
Photo Film Co.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Rank Xerox Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, but would contribute much
of the remaining technology itself, the executives said.
<LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> dominates the market for laser-printer engines,
primarily through <ORGANIZATION>Canon Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, which supplies the guts of
several printer brands, including <PERSON>Hewlett</PERSON>'s all-conquering
LaserJet family.
   Rank <ORGANIZATION>Xerox Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, a U.K.-based joint venture between <ORGANIZATION>Xerox
Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Rank Organisation PLC</ORGANIZATION>, is itself a low-end
competitor in the European market for printers in the 12- to
19-page-a-minute range. Other sellers of printers in this
speed category include <ORGANIZATION>Matsushita Electric Industrial Co.</ORGANIZATION>'s
<ORGANIZATION>Panasonic</ORGANIZATION> brand, <ORGANIZATION>Kyocera Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Fujitsu Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>QMS Inc.</ORGANIZATION>,
<ORGANIZATION>Digital Equipment Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>International Business Machines
Corp</ORGANIZATION>.  <ORGANIZATION>Lexmark International Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a recent <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION> laser printer
spinoff, based in <LOCATION>Lexington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ky.</LOCATION>, also plans to enter the
faster segment during <DATE>1992</DATE>.
   Designed to function in a PC network, the new <ORGANIZATION>Compaq</ORGANIZATION>
printers will likely be portrayed as plug-and-play components
for high-performance corporate networks, a business area that
<ORGANIZATION>Compaq</ORGANIZATION> has been trying to expand lately.
   While noncommittal about the company's chance of success
as a printer maker, industry analysts said <ORGANIZATION>Compaq</ORGANIZATION> will
certainly benefit from a new way to differentiate itself from
makers of cheap "clone" PCs, which have become the bane of
its existence lately.
   "A lot of companies have been caught by surprise by
success of the clone companies," said U.K.-based printer
analyst <PERSON>Greg Porell</PERSON>, of <ORGANIZATION>BIS Strategic Decisions</ORGANIZATION>. "As the PC
market has become price-driven, <ORGANIZATION>Compaq</ORGANIZATION>'s market share has
dropped. What they're doing now is looking for ways to get
incremental business -- and maybe offering a printer will
give them an edge in the corporate market."

  [Text] The BMFT [<ORGANIZATION>Federal Ministry for Research and 
Technology</ORGANIZATION>] is providing about <MONEY>270 million German marks</MONEY> up to 
<DATE>1997</DATE> for development of new laser sources and applications. The 
new "Laser 2000" research focus is intended to speed up the 
generational change from tube (gas lasers) to semiconductor 
technology (diode lasers) in <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>. The main thrust of the 
program is: basic research for new generations of lasers, 
precision machining using lasers, new applications, and laser 
medicine. Work on the pilot project on high-power diode lasers 
has already begun with leading participation of Jenaoptik. 
According to <PERSON>Dr. Werner Gries</PERSON> of BMFT, the goal is to develop a 
small high-power, low-maintenance laser that is usable in a wide 
range of products.

  [Text] Sharp developed technology for oscillation with a 
high-output semiconductor laser which emits 680 nanometer red 
light. By attaching a transparent layer, which acts as a window, 
to the laser's end surface, Sharp was able to achieve the 
world's highest output (295 milliwatts) by preventing heat 
generation, which occurs when the end surface of the crystal 
absorbs light and deteriorates. This achievement will raise the 
reliability during the recording and reading of data on optical 
discs. Sharp will continue to prevent the deterioration of 
interior elements and such and also plans to apply this 
technology to short wavelength lasers, which are suitable for 
high density recording. 
  The most distinguishing feature of the newly developed laser 
is the window which was grown by the MOCVD [metal organic 
chemical vapor deposition] method on a laser element composed of 
aluminum, gallium, indium, and phosphorus. The window has a 
composition similar to that of the laser element. Because it is 
possible to control the light absorption at the end surface, it 
is possible for the laser to have a long life span. When 50 
milliwatt lasers were compared, the one with the window was able 
to extend its lifetime by more than 10 times that of the one 
without the window. 
  When a semiconductor laser's output is increased, the laser 
element's end surface absorbs light, heat is generated, and the 
crystal structure breaks down. Up until now, the optical output 
for a red laser came to a halt at 200 milliwatts. 
  The red semiconductor laser is used for compact disc [CD] 
reading and for minidisc [MD] reading and writing. A 700 
nanometer type with an output from 30-50 milliwatts has been put 
to practical use. The volume of information, which includes 
imagery and voice and such, increases the need for the 
commercialization of shortwave lasers that can record with 
higher speed and more density. The company intends to apply this 
element design to short wavelength lasers with high output.

  [Text] The <ORGANIZATION>Semiconductor Technology Center of Matsushita 
Electric Industrial Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> developed the world's first 
surface-emission laser optoelectronic integrated circuit (<ORGANIZATION>OEIC</ORGANIZATION>) 
which can operate 10 times as fast as a conventional matrix-type 
surface-emission laser. The center designed a unique system in 
which transistors are mounted on lasers (transistor-on-laser) 
and lined up 64 lasers in an array-formation in a cell that is a 
480 micron square. Each laser has a built-in transistor as its 
driver. As a result, this accomplishment makes 10 gigahertz 
high-speed operations functionally possible and it will open up 
the way to the attainment of optical computers and optical 
switchboards. 
  Innovations in the CPU [Central Processing Unit] and such 
have advanced the speed of computers. However, transmission 
delays become a problem when there is an interchange among them 
on networks. It has been pointed out that there are limits to 
the present method used to amplify the signal by converting 
optical communications into electricity. 
  Therefore, there is a strong need for optical switches and 
such which will make ultra high speed circuitry possible for the 
switching of optical signals, without conversion, between 
optical fibers. The surface-emission laser is expected to be one 
of the basic technologies to make this possible. 
  Although a chip has been developed which has integrated over 
a thousand elements in the surface-emission laser, the 
conventional product uses a matrix form of circuitry which needs 
a large electric current to change the frequency of the laser. 
Moreover, the circuit distance from the driver transistor is so 
great that it makes high-speed operations difficult. 
  In this instance, the device developed by <ORGANIZATION>Matsushita 
Electric</ORGANIZATION> 
has 64 0.98 nanometer wavelength surface-emission lasers each 
integrated with a driver transistor. This structure uses a 
unique method of putting the transistor on top of the laser. By 
doing this, <PERSON>Matsushita</PERSON> made it possible to increase the 
high-speed operations to more than 10 times that of the 
matrix-type and also made it possible to increase the density 
and reduce the area to one third of the latter type. A special 
quality is that it is feasible to increase the speed up of 10 
gigahertz and it is expected that this development will 
drastically promote the utilization of optical computers and 
optical switches.

   A zinc selenide laser that produces a
blue beam and can be focused more tightly than other lasers could
eventually triple the amount of information stored on optical
computer disks, its developer says.
   Japanese researchers in <DATE>March</DATE> developed a zinc selenide laser,
but it had to be cooled to 135 degrees below zero Fahrenheit,
according to the <ORGANIZATION>University of Florida</ORGANIZATION>, which announced a more
practical, room-temperature laser.
   Zinc selenide produces a blue beam that can focus on a spot
one-third the size of that produced by current materials, packing
information more densely on optical disks, increasing capacity.
Optical storage has been slow to be adopted in computers because it
is not as economical as magnetic storage.
   But optical disks have some marked advantages, primarily in
volume. The NeXT computer developed by <ORGANIZATION>Apple</ORGANIZATION> founder <PERSON>Steven Jobs</PERSON> is
the first desktop model to use an optical disk as a primary storage

   A zinc selenide laser that produces a
blue beam and can be focused more tightly than other lasers could
eventually triple the amount of information stored on optical
computer disks, its developer says.
   Japanese researchers in <DATE>March</DATE> developed a zinc selenide laser,
but it had to be cooled to 135 degrees below zero Fahrenheit,
according to the <ORGANIZATION>University of Florida</ORGANIZATION>, which announced a more
practical, room-temperature laser.
   Zinc selenide produces a blue beam that can focus on a spot
one-third the size of that produced by current materials, packing
information more densely on optical disks, increasing capacity.
Optical storage has been slow to be adopted in computers because it
is not as economical as magnetic storage.
   But optical disks have some marked advantages, primarily in
volume. The NeXT computer developed by <ORGANIZATION>Apple</ORGANIZATION> founder <PERSON>Steven Jobs</PERSON> is
the first desktop model to use an optical disk as a primary storage
device.

<FÊP=106> [Article by Yu Ruming [0151 3067 2494]: ``16 Achievements of </F>
MEI Institute 44 Pass Appraisal''] 
  [Summary] MEI Institute 44, tracking the world 
state-of-the-art, recently developed 16 military and civilian 
optoelectronic devices, which passed product design finalization 
on 23 <DATE>March</DATE>. Prominent among these 16 devices is the GR1342J 
superradiation light-emitting diode, the first domestically 
developed superradiation LED meeting early-90s international 
commercial standards. This new device, fabricated with an 
epitaxial technique and end-face film depostion, is used as an 
intermediary between LEDs and laser diodes, and is an ideal 
light source for fiber optic gyros. Other important devices 
include the GD3255Y fast-response, high-sensitivity, 
large-photosensitive-surface non-magnetic photodiode, an 
embargoed optoelectronic detector used in asdic [i.e. 
anti-submarine detection] systems; the GZ1140Z 
broad-passband-range, low-intra-passband-ripple, 
steep-transition-band CCD [charge-coupled device] recursive 
filter used in new-generation radar systems; the SK161 coaxial 
hermetic package used in high-power pulsed laser diodes for key 
State projects and also for laser diode arrays and LEDs; the 
GD5281Y high-sensitivity, broad-dynamic-range quadrant avalanche 
detector [i.e. photodiode] used in missile guidance and 
tracking, security monitoring, medical diagnosis, and robot 
vision systems; the GH5200Q zero-light-detection switch; the 
GH1200Z and two other models of optical couplers; and the 
GH8740J and one other ac/dc solid state relay.
