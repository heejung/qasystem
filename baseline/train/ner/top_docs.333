<HEAD>Bush Picks ``Endeavour'' For Name Of New Space Shuttle</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> will go after some historical ``colour''
by naming its newest space shuttle, built to replace the destroyed
Challenger, after a British sailing ship.
   The space agency announced <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> that President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> had
selected the name ``Endeavour`` after it was the most popular name
in a national name-the-shuttle competition among <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s school
children.
   The Endeavor was the flagship used by 18th century English
explorer <PERSON>James Cook</PERSON>.
   Thirty-one of the 111 state-level winners in the competition
chose the name Endeavour, although many of the entries used the
American spelling of Endeavor. Second most popular among the state
winners, with 12 selections, was Resolution.
   The competition was in two divisions, kindergarten through grade
6, and grades 7 through 12. <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> selected a winning entry in each
category.
   The winning entry for kindergarten through grade 6 was from the
fifth graders of <ORGANIZATION>Senatobia Middle School</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Senatobia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Miss</LOCATION>.
   Winning in the other division was <ORGANIZATION>Tallulah Falls School</ORGANIZATION>,
<PERSON>Tallulah Falls</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Ga</LOCATION>.
   For their winning project, the <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION> fifth graders created
a space camp where younger children were taught about space.
   The Tallulah Falls entry had two parts _ a magazine called
``Math Exploration with <PERSON>James Cook</PERSON>,'' and a play called ``Where on
Earth?'' which compared <ORGANIZATION>Cook</ORGANIZATION>'s explorations with the voyages of a
space shuttle called Endeavour.
   More than 6,100 teams, formed by 71,650 students, submitted
research projects supporting the names selected. Panels from each
of the state education agencies then sorted through the entries and
picked state winners in the two divisions. From these state
winners, <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> made his selection.
   Endeavour was the name <PERSON>James Cook</PERSON> chose for the 98-foot vessel
he used to explore the <LOCATION>South Pacific</LOCATION> <DATE>from 1768</DATE> to <DATE>1772</DATE>. He sailed
southwest from <LOCATION>Plymouth</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>, around <LOCATION>South America</LOCATION>, then
explored the coasts of <LOCATION>New Zealand</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New Guinea</LOCATION> before
returning to <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> by way of <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Cape of Good Hope</LOCATION>,
completing a circumnavigation of the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   Cook chose the name Resolution for a ship he used in his second
and third voyages exploring the <LOCATION>Pacific Ocean</LOCATION>. During those trips,
<ORGANIZATION>Cook</ORGANIZATION> went as far north as the <ORGANIZATION>Arctic Ocean</ORGANIZATION> and as far south as the
<ORGANIZATION>Antarctic Circle</ORGANIZATION>. He located and named the <LOCATION>Sandwich Islands</LOCATION>, later
called <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>, and was killed there in <DATE>1779</DATE>.
   The second vessel in <LOCATION>Cook</LOCATION>'s company during his final voyage was
named Discovery, the same as that given to one of the current space
shuttles.
   Challenger was destroyed <DATE>Jan. 28, 1986</DATE> in an explosion that
killed seven astronauts. When <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> authorized money for a
replacement shuttle, it directed that <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s school children
would name the new craft.
   The new shuttle craft is now being built by <ORGANIZATION>Rockwell
International</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Downey</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif</LOCATION>. It is scheduled for completion in
<DATE>1991</DATE> and will make its first space voyage in <DATE>March 1992</DATE>.

   Names of the ships of 18th-century British
explorer Capt. <PERSON>James Cook</PERSON> were the most popular choices among
<LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s school children in <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s name-the-shuttle contest.
   The space agency said that 31 of the 111 state-level winners in a
national student competition chose the name Endeavour, though many
of the entries used the American spelling of Endeavor. Second most
popular among the state winners, with 12 selections, was Resolution.
   Both Endeavour and Resolution are names <PERSON>Cook</PERSON> used for his ships
of exploration.
   A close third in popularity, with 11 choices, was <PERSON>Victoria</PERSON>, the
name of the ship used by <ORGANIZATION>Ferdinand Magellan</ORGANIZATION>, the 16th century
Portuguese navigator.
   State-level winners in the shuttle-naming competition were
selected by committees in each of the states, the <ORGANIZATION>District of
Columbia</ORGANIZATION> and four <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> territories, and from the schools of the
<ORGANIZATION>Bureau of Indian Affairs</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Defense Department</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>State
Department</ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> announced the selections <DATE>Monday</DATE>.
   More than 6,100 teams, formed by 71,650 students, submitted
research projects supporting and justifying the names selected.
Panels from each of the state education agencies then sorted through
the entries and picked state winners in two divisions, kindergarten
through grade 6, and grades 7 through 12.
   The state-level winners will be reviewed by <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> and the final
winners in each division will be named in <DATE>May</DATE>, along with the chosen
name for the shuttle.
   Under the direction of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> is letting <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s school
children choose the name of the new shuttle which now is being
built. The new ship will replace Challenger, the shuttle that
exploded on <DATE>Jan. 28, 1986</DATE>, and killed seven astronauts including
school teacher <PERSON>Christa McAuliffe</PERSON>.
   Endeavour was the name Cook chose for the 98-foot vessel he used
to explore the <LOCATION>South Pacific</LOCATION> <DATE>from 1768</DATE> to <DATE>1772</DATE>. He sailed southwest
from <LOCATION>Plymouth</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>, around <LOCATION>South America</LOCATION>, then explored the

<HEAD>Students Asked To Name Replacement For Space Shuttle Challenger</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> asked the nation's
schoolchildren to select a name for the space shuttle that will
replace Challenger, destroyed in an explosion in <DATE>1986</DATE>.
   The agency, in cooperation with the <ORGANIZATION>Council of Chief State
School Officers</ORGANIZATION>, invited teachers to enter their students in a
national competition to name the orbiter, now being built and
scheduled for its maiden flight in <DATE>1992</DATE>.
   ``The orbiter-naming program responds to a basic human impulse
to name things,'' the announcement said. ``<ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s first orbiters
were named after sea vessels used in research and exploration. The
tradition of naming an orbiter after an exploratory or research sea
vessel will be continued.''
   The three remaining shuttles in the fleet are Discovery,
Atlantis and <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION>.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> said the name Challenger had been retired, in honor of the
seven astronauts killed in the explosion.
   The announcement said the name chosen should not only identify
an American spacecraft but also should capture the spirit of
<LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s mission in space.
   Announcements of opportunity will be distributed soon to
elementary and secondary teachers and principals. Entry packets
will be available in <DATE>May</DATE>.
   ``To enter, elementary and secondary school students will form
teams and research a name,'' <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> said. ``Each team will prepare a
related classroom project to support and justify the name
selected.''
   There will be two entry divisions, covering kindergarten through
the sixth grade and seventh through 12th grades.
   Students in public and private schools in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> territories, <ORGANIZATION>Department of Defense</ORGANIZATION> overseas dependents'
schools and <ORGANIZATION>Bureau of Indian Affairs</ORGANIZATION> schools are eligible.
   Each state, territory and agency will announce one winner in
each division in <DATE>March 1989</DATE>. <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> will announce the final winner
for each division and the name selected for the new shuttle in <DATE>May
1989</DATE>.

<LEADPARA>  The $1.8 billion space shuttle Endeavour officially rolled off the Rockwell
production line here Thursday, replacing the ill-fated Challenger and bringing
NASA's space fleet back up to its full complement of four vehicles.;    To the
majestic strains of "Thus Spake Zarathustra" -- which became the unofficial
anthem of the space generation when it was used as theme music in the film
"2001: A Space Odyssey" -- the 5-story tall, gleaming white craft made its
debut before a crowd of 3,000 employees and well-wishers at Air Force Plant 42.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  NEW SHUTTLE UNVEILED; ENDEAVOUR MAKES FOUR  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     The <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION> will not take delivery,
however, until Endeavour is flown piggyback on a 747 to the <ORGANIZATION>Kennedy Space
Flight Center</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Cape Canaveral</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla.</LOCATION>, this weekend.;    Although the orbiter
will actually not be completed until after it reaches <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> officials
and astronauts waxed poetic about it.;    "Endeavour, the jewel of the fleet!
Isn't it beautiful?" asked astronaut <PERSON>Daniel Brandenstein</PERSON>, who will command the
shuttle on its first voyage in <DATE>March 1992</DATE>, a mission to bolt a new rocket
motor onto a failed communications satellite. "I tell you, if that doesn't put
a lump in your throat, I don't think you're human.";    The new shuttle
incorporates all the improvements that have been made on the other three
shuttles, and some that will not appear on those shuttles until later. The
most obvious is a drag parachute that will be deployed on landing to slow the
orbiter, thereby easing pressure on the brakes and landing gear.;    The
parachute and a newly beefed-up nose wheel will also increase control of the
shuttle when it is forced to land on the concrete runway at the <LOCATION>Kennedy</LOCATION> center
rather than on the longer and wider dry lake bed at <ORGANIZATION>Edwards Air Force Base</ORGANIZATION>
near here.;    Endeavour also contains more fuel cells, which generate
electricity, to allow it to stay in orbit for as long as 28 days, twice as
long as the existing craft.;    At the ceremony, <PERSON>Brandenstein</PERSON> was presented
with part of the sternpost recovered from the first Endeavour, a research ship
commanded by British explorer Capt. <PERSON>James Cook</PERSON> between <DATE>1768</DATE> and <DATE>1771</DATE>. The
centuries-old memento will be carried into space on Endeavour's first
mission.;    Endeavour joins Discovery, which is scheduled to lift off <DATE>Sunday</DATE>
<TIME>morning</TIME> on a military mission, and Atlantis and <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION>, which were also
named after sea-going research vessels. The shuttle replaces Challenger, which
exploded 73 seconds after liftoff on <DATE>Jan. 28, 1986</DATE>, killing all seven aboard.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>
   President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> made a small ceremony do double
duty <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> as he honored the most recent space fliers and two
groups of school children who picked the winning name for the
newest space shuttle.
   ``We are gathered here today to celebrate the continuity of our
space program and really of our country itself, of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>
herself,'' the president said as he shared a <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> stage with
five shuttle astronauts, nine fifth-graders and nine math students
from grades 8-12.
   ``In a sense today's setting reflects the continuity,'' he said.
``You are pioneers pushing back the boundaries of our technological
future.''
   To astronauts <PERSON>David Walker</PERSON>, <PERSON>Ronald Grabe</PERSON>, <PERSON>Norman Thagard</PERSON>, <PERSON>Mark
Lee</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mary Cleave</PERSON>, who returned on <DATE>May 8</DATE> from a four-day shuttle
mission, the president said, ``You've reaffirmed your nation's
genius in science and technology and yet, I think we would all
agree, this really is only just the beginning.''
   The crew on the 29th shuttle flight launched a space probe that
will orbit Venus after an 800-million-mile, 15-month journey and
map the surface of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s fog-shrouded sister planet.
   The pupils, from <ORGANIZATION>Senatobia Middle School</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Senatobia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Miss.</LOCATION>,
and <ORGANIZATION>Tallulah Falls School</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Tallulah Falls</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ga.</LOCATION>,. each submitted
the name ``Endeavour,'' for the shuttle being built to replace the
ill-fated Challenger, which exploded after its launch in <DATE>January
1986</DATE>.
   ``My friends, choosing a name can be a thankless task,'' said
<PERSON>Bush</PERSON>. ``Consider the new father who was once reproached by <PERSON>Sam
Goldwyn</PERSON>. `You are going to call your son <LOCATION>William</LOCATION>,' he said. ``What
kind of a name is that? Every <PERSON>Tom</PERSON>, <PERSON>Dick</PERSON> and <PERSON>Harry</PERSON> is called
<PERSON>William</PERSON>.'''
   Endeavour will have the British spelling. It was the name of the
flagship used by <PERSON>James Cook</PERSON>, the <DATE>18th century</DATE> English explorer and
it was chosn from several names by 31 of the 111 state-level
winners.
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> recalled that more than 6,100 teams formed by 71,650
students submitted research projects supporting the names they
selected. Panels from state education agencies picked state winners
in the two divisions and <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> made the final selection.

   President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> announced <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> he will
nominate <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> Rear Adm. <PERSON>Richard Truly</PERSON>, an astronaut who flew in two
space shuttle missions, to head the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space
Administration</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``This marks the first time in its distinguished history that
<ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> will be led by a hero of its own making, an astronaut who has
been to space,'' <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> told members of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> and others at the
<ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION>.
   Truly, 50, became a <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> astronaut in <DATE>1969</DATE> and has been the
agency's associate administrator for space flight since <DATE>1986</DATE>. He
piloted the shuttle <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION> on <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s second space shuttle flight
and was commander of the eighth flight in <DATE>1983</DATE>.
   He led the recovery team after the Challenger disaster on <DATE>Jan.
28, 1986</DATE>, and a subsequent team in charge of redesigning the
shuttle's boosters and revamping safety procedures.
   ``Because <PERSON>Dick Truly</PERSON> is an active duty naval officer, I will
need the assent and cooperation of the <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> to make this
appointment,'' the president said.
   B. <PERSON>Jay Cooper</PERSON>, deputy <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> press secretary, said <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>
had agreed to waive a requirement that the head of <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> be a
civilian.
   The position is subject to confirmation by the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>.
   The president also announced that he plans to nominate <PERSON>James R.
Thompson Jr.</PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Marshall Space Flight Center</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Huntsville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ala.</LOCATION>, to succeed <PERSON>Dale D. Myers</PERSON> as deputy administrator
of the agency.
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> said that immediately after the ceremony, Truly was leaving
for <LOCATION>Cape Canaveral</LOCATION> to take charge of the flight readiness team for
the next space shuttle flight, in which the shuttle Atlantis will
carry the <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> radar mapping device.
   ``The launch of <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> is the first in a series of
long-planned space science missions scheduled for <DATE>1989</DATE>, and I
personally place a great deal of importance in our nation's civil
space program,'' the president said.
   Truly, asked after the ceremony what his top priority would be,
said, ``To have a good flight readiness and get <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> on its way
to Venus.''
   The president thanked <PERSON>James Fletcher</PERSON>, who attended the
ceremonial announcement in the <PERSON>Roosevelt Room</PERSON>, for ``an outstanding
job'' as head of <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>. Fletcher retired from the post <DATE>last month</DATE>

   Some 250 spectators cheered as a space
shuttle main engine roared to life and sent smoke across the
<ORGANIZATION>Marshall Space Flight Center</ORGANIZATION> during a successful 45-second test
firing.
   ``Anything that goes the full duration looks and sounds like a
good test to me,'' center director <PERSON>J.R. Thompson</PERSON> said after
<DATE>Saturday</DATE>'s test at the northern <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION> base.
   <PERSON>Thompson</PERSON> said the benefits of the test firings should be seen by
the mid-1990s when <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> plans to begin sending pieces of its space
station into orbit aboard the space shuttle.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> engineers fired the engine as part of a series of tests to
make the main engines for the space shuttle more effective.
   <PERSON>John McCarty</PERSON>, head of the propulsion laboratory at <LOCATION>Marshall</LOCATION>, said
the tests will help reduce internal engine stress, making the
shuttle's main engines last longer.
   ``We're validating changes in the engine _ the first real ones
since it was designed in <DATE>1972</DATE>,'' <PERSON>McCarty</PERSON> said.
   <DATE>Saturday</DATE>'s 45-second test firing will be followed in three to
four weeks by a longer 100-second firing.

   The successful 1,000th test firing this
past week of a main space shuttle engine at <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>National Space
Technology Laboratories</ORGANIZATION> shows the engine's reliability, officials
say.
   ``This 1,000th test is a milestone,'' NSTL Director <PERSON>Jerry Hlass</PERSON>
said.
   The test was conducted <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> for a duration of 9
minutes, 33 seconds.
   ``Engine 0211 is being checked out ... and early indications
show the test firing was a succcess,'' <ORGANIZATION>Boyce Mix</ORGANIZATION>, the engine test
manager at <ORGANIZATION>Marshall Space Flight Center</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Huntsville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ala.</LOCATION>, said
<DATE>Friday</DATE>.
   Space shuttle main engine testing has been conducted at <ORGANIZATION>NSTL</ORGANIZATION>
since <DATE>June 1975</DATE>.
   ``Last year at <ORGANIZATION>NSTL</ORGANIZATION>, there was a record number of engine tests
in terms of test duration _ 33,738 seconds, the equivalent time the
engines would be required to perform for 22 shuttle launches,''
<PERSON>Hlass</PERSON> said. ``Our team is working very diligently to do its part in
returning the shuttle to safe flight.''
   <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>'s test was the 11th conducted this year, said
<PERSON>Mack Herring</PERSON>, NSTL public affairs officer.
   Each shuttle orbiter is powered by three main engines, which
operate for the first 8.5 minutes of flight to propel the shuttle
to the point of near-earth orbit.
   All main engines used for shuttle missions are test-fired three
times before they are transported by truck to the <ORGANIZATION>Kennedy Space
Center</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>.
   The testing is conducted by the <ORGANIZATION>Rocketdyne Division of Rockwell
International</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION>'s
prime contractor for the shuttle engines.

<HEAD>Soviet Shuttle Launch Delayed Indefinitely By Launch System Problem</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A fault found at the last minute in one of the
launch systems of the Soviet space shuttle forced scientists today
to indefinitely postpone the maiden voyage of the unmanned craft.
   The official <ORGANIZATION>Tass</ORGANIZATION> news agency said a computer halted the
countdown 51 seconds before launch to prevent the booster, known as
<ORGANIZATION>Energiya</ORGANIZATION>, from hitting the launch platform during liftoff.
   ``The assembly platform for emergency evacuation of cosmonauts
... didn't move away from the Energiya body to a safe distance,''
<ORGANIZATION>Tass</ORGANIZATION> said. The platform is believed to be an arm-like structure that
stretches to the booster.
   A computer that senses 140 elements of the launch system
terminated the launch process, <ORGANIZATION>Tass</ORGANIZATION> said. The report quoted the test
control chief at the <ORGANIZATION>Baikonur Cosmodrome</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Soviet Central Asia</LOCATION>, air
force Maj. Gen. <PERSON>V. Gudilin</PERSON>.
   Gudilin told <ORGANIZATION>Tass</ORGANIZATION> he didn't think it would be long before the
launch would be attempted again, but he said a thorough analysis of
today's problem would have to be completed before a new blastoff
date was decided.
   Fuel was drained from the rocket, <ORGANIZATION>Tass</ORGANIZATION> said, and it appeared a
second launch attempt would not be made today.
   The shuttle, named Buran, or snowstorm in Russian, was originally
set to lift off late <DATE>Friday</DATE> from the Baikonur launch site on the
Central Asian steppe in <LOCATION>Kazakhstan</LOCATION>. But <ORGANIZATION>Tass and Radio Moscow</ORGANIZATION>
announced earlier today a four-hour delay, one half-hour after the
scheduled launch time expired.
   Then, seconds before liftoff a second time, <ORGANIZATION>Tass</ORGANIZATION> in a terse
statement announced there was an ``indefinite'' delay.
   There was no live report from Baikonur by either radio or
television. Foreign reporters were not allowed to travel to Baikonur.
   Buran was to make two orbits and return to a concrete landing
strip eight miles from the launch site. Reports indicated the
initial flight would be devoted entirely to checking out the craft
and would not be used to deploy satellites or conduct any other
missions.
   Ships stationed in the <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> oceans, a satellite
network and a string of ground stations were poised to communicate
with the craft and monitor its flight, Soviet television said in a
brief report.
   Buran is attached to the Energiya rocket, the world's most
powerful launcher, and four liquid-fuel boosters. It looks like the
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> space shuttle.
   But Soviet officials say it can carry a payload of 66,000 pounds,
compared to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> shuttle's 55,000 pounds, is safer and more
flexible.
   The fully automated guidance system permits scientists to send
the craft into space for the first time without cosmonauts,
decreasing the risk to human life, Soviet officials said.
   In the past, the officials have been critical of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> shuttle
program that was stalled until this <DATE>fall</DATE> after seven astronauts were
killed in the explosion of the Challenger in <DATE>January 1986</DATE>.
   In a report late <DATE>Friday</DATE>, the television news program Vremya
revealed Soviet military involvement in the Soviet shuttle program.
   ``As always in our country, military specialists participate in
crucial, dangerous tests,'' a correspondent said in a report from
<LOCATION>Baikonur</LOCATION>.
   It identified the military official overseeing shuttle operations
as <PERSON>Alexander A. Maksimov</PERSON>. It identified him as the <ORGANIZATION>Defense
Ministry</ORGANIZATION>'s top specialist on ``multiple-use space transport systems
and the prospect of their development.''
   Soviet officials repeatedly have criticized military use of the
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> space shuttle, and have called for space to be used only for
peaceful purposes.
   The <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Defense Department</ORGANIZATION>, in its <DATE>1988</DATE> publication Soviet
Military Power, says the Soviets might use a shuttle to deploy
anti-satellite and ballistic missile defense weapons.
   Reports <DATE>Friday</DATE> said the Buran can carry as many as 10 people _
four cosmonauts and six passengers _ and placed its cost of Energiya
and Buran at about that of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> shuttle, some <MONEY>$10 billion</MONEY>.
   Energiya, which can lift a payload of more than 100 tons, has
been used only once before. On a test flight in <DATE>May 1987</DATE>, its
payload failed to reach orbit, but Soviet officials said the problem
was with the guidance system of the satellite rather than with the
gigantic booster.

A Cree Indian has completed a 2,700-mile run from <LOCATION>Edmonton</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>, to <LOCATION>New York 
City</LOCATION> to lay claim to a sacred relic stored in the <ORGANIZATION>American Museum of Natural 
History</ORGANIZATION>. Carrying a curved staff draped with eagle feathers for strength and 
wearing a wolf pelt for protection, <PERSON>Jim Thunder</PERSON> said he was driven by a 
recurring dream in which Chief Big Bear of the Crees instructed him to retrieve 
the artifact -- a parcel of calico holding bear claws, a clump of sweet grass 
and a plug of tobacco. Big Bear, leader of the <PERSON>Plains Cree</PERSON>, made the sacred 
bundle about 150 years ago when he was about 13 years old and wore it into 
battle for strength and guidance. In <DATE>1934</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Big Bear</ORGANIZATION>'s son gave it to a museum 
researcher in western <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> for safekeeping. Since that time, the museum has 
kept it as part of a research collection but has never put it on display. 
Thunder and a small delegation of Indians were to meet with museum officials 
who will decide whether to give up the parcel. Thunder told about 100 Indians 
and supporters: "We are confident that we will get the bundle back because 
since the <DATE>1930s</DATE> there have been prophesies that it would return."

 -- After 40 years, 11,000 performances and 500 stitches, legendary tiger tamer 
<PERSON>Gunther Gebel-Williams</PERSON> has decided it's time to call it quits before his skills 
start to fade. The 54-year-old performer, who is beginning his two-year 
farewell tour with <ORGANIZATION>Ringling Bros.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus</ORGANIZATION>, said: "I'm 
still very strong, but when you get older your eyesight begins to go and I have 
to wear glasses offstage. But I can't wear them in the ring." Williams became 
famous for his ability to control animals without the usual whip, chair or 
pistol. In his current show, he puts <LOCATION>Bengal</LOCATION> and Siberian tigers through their 
paces, stands on the back of a charging elephant and puts Lippizaner horses 
through a ballet routine. "I am very close to my cats," he said, "but I can't 
ever let down my guard because while I can succeed in training them, I can 
never tame them."

   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s first
interplanetary probe in 11 years, is named for a Portuguese
explorer who 467 years ago led the expedition that was the first to
sail around the world.
   After it is deployed in orbit by the space shuttle, the <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>
probe will travel to Venus in 15 months. The 800-million-mile
voyage will last less than half as long as it took a 16th-century
expedition led by <ORGANIZATION>Ferdinand Magellan</ORGANIZATION> to sail around the world.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>, who chose to sail under the Spanish flag, was
commander of a five-ship flotilla that left <LOCATION>Seville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> on <DATE>Sept.
20, 1519</DATE> to search for a route to the so-called <ORGANIZATION>Spice Islands</ORGANIZATION> in
the south <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION>.
   The fleet reached <LOCATION>South America</LOCATION> in <DATE>December</DATE> and then sailed
around the southern tip of that continent through what came to be
called the Straits of <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>.
   After following the west coast of <LOCATION>South America</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>
directed his fleet across the <LOCATION>Pacific Ocean</LOCATION>. The ships made
landfall at <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> on <DATE>March 6, 1521</DATE>, and then went on to what became
the <LOCATION>Philippine Islands</LOCATION>.
   The Spanish sailors got into a fight with natives on <LOCATION>Mactan
Island</LOCATION> on <DATE>April 27, 1521</DATE>, and <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> was killed. The anniversary
of his death fell on <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s fleet continued its voyage, with <PERSON>Juan Sebastian
Elcano</PERSON> in command, but one ship after another was lost until only
the <LOCATION>Victoria</LOCATION> was left. The vessel returned to <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> on <DATE>Sept. 8,
1522</DATE>. Only 17 men, of an original crew of 270, survived the
three-year voyage.
   Though <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> died before the trip ended, he is generally
credited with the first circumnavigation of the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   Stargazing sailors on the voyage are credited with discovery of
two star galaxies, called the <ORGANIZATION>Magellanic Clouds</ORGANIZATION>, which are visible
only from the southern hemisphere.

   Space shuttle Atlantis
landed on a gusty desert runway <DATE>Monday</DATE> after putting <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> planetary
exploration back on track with the launch of the unmanned <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>
probe to <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>.
   Atlantis touched down at <TIME>12:43 p.m. PDT</TIME> on a concrete runway at
<ORGANIZATION>Rogers Dry Lake</ORGANIZATION> after a fiery, hour-long plunge from orbit 184
miles above <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   ``Congratulations and nice landing,'' said capsule communicator
<PERSON>Frank Culbertson</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION>. ``You've extended the shuttle's reach
far beyond <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> orbit now. Commodore Magellan (the <DATE>16th century</DATE>
explorer for which the Venus probe was named) would approve.''
   ``It's good to be back. It's a great trip,'' shuttle commander
<PERSON>David M. Walker</PERSON> told reporters and space agency workers before the
crew flew back to <ORGANIZATION>Johnson Space Center</ORGANIZATION> four hours after landing.
   ``We had a great time on orbit. ... We hope you liked what we
did,'' said mission specialist <PERSON>Mary L. Cleave</PERSON>.
   The crew left the orbiter about an hour after landing and
inspected its underside, accompanied by senior <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics
and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION> officials. They found little damage to its
thermal tiles.
   ``The vehicle looks about as clean as any one that I've ever
seen,'' <PERSON>Richard Truly</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s acting associate administrator for
space flight, told a post-landing news conference.
   ``The <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> spacecraft ... is floating toward the planet
Venus to open up a new era of planetary exploration,'' Truly said.
   Only about 27,500 of a predicted 100,000 spectators braved
baking heat to see Atlantis dive through the thin, high clouds and
rock the desert with the its signature twin sonic booms.
   About 200 people cheered the astronauts' return home <DATE>Monday</DATE>
<TIME>night</TIME> at <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Ellington Field</ORGANIZATION>. Even a few of the astronauts'
dogs were on hand to greet their <TIME>9:45 p.m.</TIME> CDT arrival.
   ``I can't tell you how grateful all of us are to those of you
who have supported us personally and professionally through all
these many months of training and through, in fact, our whole
careers,'' <PERSON>Walker</PERSON> told the crowd of mostly <ORGANIZATION>Johnson Space Center</ORGANIZATION>
workers.
   The astronauts left the airport with their families. They were
scheduled to report back to work <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> to begin reviewing their
mission.
   Just 12 minutes before touchdown, Atlantis was ordered to land
on the concrete Runway 22 rather than the hard-packed clay of
Runway 17 as dust devils whipped up by the variable winds twirled
across the lakebed.
   Truly said the switch was apparently ordered because the
crosswind angle was better on the concrete runway for a test of
handling under such conditions _ a precursor to someday resuming
landings at <ORGANIZATION>Kennedy Space Center</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>.
   The crosswinds at landing were believed to have ranged from 12.6
mph to 20.7 mph, which would have yielded ``significant''
information on such landings, <PERSON>Arnold D. Aldrich</PERSON>, director of the
shuttle program.
   Re-entry began when two big engines at the rear of the
spacecraft ignited and burned for 2 minutes, 38 seconds over the
<ORGANIZATION>Indian Ocean on Atlantis</ORGANIZATION>' 64th orbit.
   The crew _ commander <PERSON>Walker</PERSON>, pilot <PERSON>Ronald J. Grabe</PERSON>, and mission
specialists <PERSON>Norman E. Thagard</PERSON>, <PERSON>Mark Lee</PERSON> and mission specialist
Cleave _ rocketed into space from <ORGANIZATION>Kennedy Space Center</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Thursday</DATE>
and launched the <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> spacecraft.
   The <MONEY>$550 million</MONEY> probe will reach Venus after a 15-month, 800
million-mile journey and begin mapping the surface of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s
cloud-shrouded sister.
   ``The trajectory is about as accurate as you can get,'' said
<PERSON>Lennard Fisk</PERSON>, associate administrator for space science and
applications. ``I think we demonstrated with this flight that the
shuttle is in fact very capable of putting a planetary mission up.''
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> marks the first new <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> planetary exploration in 11
years. The start of its mission was cheered by scientists working
on a variety of programs that were delayed by the long hiatus in
the shuttle program after the <DATE>Jan. 28, 1986</DATE>, Challenger disaster.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> last explored <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> with the <DATE>1978</DATE> launch of the Pioneer
probe, which examined the planet's murky atmosphere and did some
radar mapping. <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s radar should map of <PERCENT>90 percent</PERCENT> of the
planet and with much greater resolution than Pioneer.
   The <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> sent two Venera probes to Venus in <DATE>1983</DATE> but
only mapped about a quarter of its surface.
   Atlantis' mission, the fourth since shuttle flights resumed
<DATE>Sept. 29, 1988</DATE>, had two significant technical problems. The orbiter
was 31 seconds from launch on <DATE>April 28</DATE> when a short-circuit was
detected in a fuel pump, delaying takeoff until the pump and a
leaky fuel line were replaced. On <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, one of the four redundant
computers that control the shuttle's systems failed.
   The crew was able to restart the computer but mission
controllers decided not to trust it for re-entry. The crew
abandoned other tasks and spent 4{ hours replacing the faulty
computer with a spare, the first time that had been done.
   The shuttle could land with just one computer operating,
according to <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>.
   Until the computer problem developed, the crew had worked on an
experiment involving crystallizing a metal sample in a furnace and
had photographed lightning and pollution on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   The workload for mission STS-30 was light because <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> and
its booster weighed 45,000 pounds, cutting the number of
experiments that could be carried.
   The mission also served to boost flight experience in the
shuttle astronaut corps. It was the third shuttle flight for
<PERSON>Thagard</PERSON>, the second for <PERSON>Walker</PERSON>, <PERSON>Grabe</PERSON> and Cleave, and the first for
Lee.

   Seconds before the scheduled blastoff, the maiden
voyage of the Soviet space shuttle was delayed <DATE>Saturday</DATE> because of
trouble with ground equipment. It was the fifth setback this year
for the Soviet space program.
   Soviet officials did not immediately announce when a second
attempt would be made to launch the Buran on its unmanned test
flight.
   Tass, the official Soviet news agency, said scientists at the
<ORGANIZATION>Baikonur Cosmodrome</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Soviet Central Asia</LOCATION> traced <DATE>Saturday</DATE>'s snag to
an equipment platform that failed to pull away from the booster
rocket.
   With 51 seconds to go, a computer stopped the countdown because
the booster, known as <ORGANIZATION>Energiya</ORGANIZATION>, would have hit the platform at
takeoff.
   The sudden halt was similar to the dramatic last-minute
postponement of the liftoff of the world's first shuttle. The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
craft <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION> was delayed for two days in <DATE>April 1981</DATE> because of
computer software problems. Some subsequent <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> shuttle flights
also were delayed.
   ``The accessory platform for emergency evacuation of cosmonauts
... didn't move away from the Energiya body to a safe distance,''
<ORGANIZATION>Tass</ORGANIZATION> said 11 hours after the scheduled <TIME>6:23 a.m.</TIME> liftoff.
   <ORGANIZATION>Tass</ORGANIZATION> said a computer that senses 140 elements of the launch
system halted the countdown and that thousands of tons of liquid
fuel were being drained from <LOCATION>Energiya</LOCATION>. The report quoted <ORGANIZATION>Baikonur</ORGANIZATION>'s
test control chief, <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> Maj. Gen. <PERSON>Vladimir E. Gudilin</PERSON>.
   The government newspaper <PERSON>Izvestia</PERSON> said the platform contained
equipment to aim the spacecraft toward the proper trajectory. The
newspaper quoted Gudilin as saying the platform withdrew somewhat,
but not completely.
   Gudilin was quoted as saying he didn't think it would be long
before the launch would be attempted again, but he said a thorough
analysis of the problem would have to be completed.
   Soviet television, in its evening news program Vremya, said the
words ``automatic termination of preparations'' flashed on a
computer screen at Baikonur as dozens of scientists watched.
   The broadcast showed the gleaming white shuttle orbiter and
rocket booster on the launch pad after the liftoff attempt, with
what it said was liquid oxygen venting from <LOCATION>Energiya</LOCATION>.
   The shuttle, which looks like the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> space shuttle, was
scheduled to orbit the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> twice and land on a runway eight miles
from the blastoff site. The flight was to be controlled entirely by
computers and was meant to test launch and landing equipment and
procedures, Soviet news reports said. There was no indication the
shuttle was to have deployed any satellites.
   Buran can carry as many as 10 people _ four cosmonauts and six
passengers. It is attached to <LOCATION>Energiya</LOCATION>, the world's most powerful
launcher, and four liquid-fuel boosters.
   <DATE>Saturday</DATE>'s postponement was the latest in a series of problems
that have dogged Soviet space flights since the <DATE>spring</DATE>:
   _Ground controllers lost contact in <DATE>April</DATE> with a Soviet
nuclear-powered satellite, Cosmos-1900, and Western Europeans
expressed concern it would release radioactivity when it re-entered
the atmosphere. The satellite burned up safely upon re-entry <DATE>Oct. 2</DATE>.
   _Soviet cosmonaut <PERSON>Anatoly Levchenko</PERSON>, a 47-year-old test pilot for
the shuttle program, died <DATE>Aug. 6</DATE> of a brain tumor. Levchenko had
been among the candidates to fly the shuttle on its first manned
mission. His death leaves <PERSON>Igor Volk</PERSON> the only cosmonaut known to be
in line for a shuttle flight.
   _A ground controller sent an incorrect signal to the unmanned
Soviet space probe Phobos 1 on <DATE>Aug. 29</DATE>, freezing the craft and
ending its radio contact with <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. The probe was on its way to
Mars on a <MONEY>multimillion-dollar</MONEY> mission to unlock the mysteries of the
planet.
   _On <DATE>Sept. 6</DATE>, an Afghan and Soviet cosmonaut were stranded in
orbit aboard a Soyuz TM-5 capsule with diminishing air and food
after two unsuccessful attempts to land. The cosmonauts eventually
overcame human error and equipment problems to land safely.
   In <DATE>Saturday</DATE>'s attempted launch, Tass initially announced a
four-hour delay but then said blastoff had been delayed
indefinitely. Soviet television did not cover launch preparations
live, and foreign reporters were not allowed to visit Baikonur.
   Soviet officials say the Buran orbiter can carry a payload of
66,000 pounds, compared to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> shuttle's 55,000 pounds, and
that it is more flexible and safer.
   In the past, the officials have been critical of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> shuttle
program, suspended until this <DATE>fall</DATE> after seven astronauts were
killed in the explosion of the Challenger in <DATE>January 1986</DATE>.
   In a report late <DATE>Friday</DATE>, the evening television news program
revealed Soviet military involvement in the Soviet shuttle program.
It identified the military official overseeing shuttle operations as
<PERSON>Alexander A. Maksimov</PERSON> but did not say how the <ORGANIZATION>Defense Ministry</ORGANIZATION> would
use the craft.

   Space workers will hold a special
<DATE>Fourth of July</DATE> ceremony when they move Discovery to the launch pad
to be readied for the first space shuttle mission since the
Challenger tragedy.
   One of the five astronauts slated to fly the early <DATE>September</DATE>
mission and <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> officials will watch from a flag-bedecked
grandstand as the spaceship is rolled out of an assembly building
into the glare of spotlights at <TIME>12:01 a.m.</TIME> <DATE>Monday</DATE>.
   Discovery will be perched upright on a giant tracked transporter
for the six-to-seven-hour trip over a 4.2-mile course to Launch Pad
39B.
   The move is timed to avoid thunderstorms and lightning, which
often occur during the daytime this time of year.
   In a brief ceremony as the move begins, <PERSON>Forrest S. McCartney</PERSON>,
director of the <ORGANIZATION>Kennedy Space Center</ORGANIZATION>, will present the astronaut
with a book containing signatures of the 15,240 workers here who
have labored to return the shuttle fleet to space.
   Commander <PERSON>Rick Hauck</PERSON> and his crew, <PERSON>Dick Covey</PERSON>, <PERSON>George Nelson</PERSON>,
<PERSON>Mike Lounge</PERSON> and <PERSON>Dave Hilmers</PERSON>, will take the book into space with
them on a four-day mission. Hilmers planned to be here for the
rollout ceremony.
   After Discovery is on the pad, employees and their families will
be able to drive by between <TIME>8 a.m. and 11 a.m.</TIME> <DATE>Monday</DATE> to get a
close look before a service structure encloses the spaceship.
   <PERSON>Jim Harrington</PERSON>, shuttle operations director here, said delays in
preparing Discovery placed the rollout date on the Fourth of <DATE>July</DATE>.
   ``We didn't plan it that way,'' he said. ``We had hoped to do it
earlier.''
   Asked if a rollout on the nation's birthday might have an
emotional impact, <PERSON>Harrington</PERSON> replied, ``No doubt it will have an
effect. The biggest effect and the biggest morale booster we can
give ourselves is to move the shuttle out to the pad, because
that's where it belongs. The name of the game here is to get the
vehicle ready to fly, and that's what we're going to do.''
   He said checks of systems will begin as soon as Discovery is on
the pad, and workers will begin preparing the spaceship for
critical firing of its three main engines on <DATE>July 24</DATE>. With the
craft bolted firmly to its launch mounts, the engines will be
ignited for 19.4 seconds to test modifications and to give the
launch team countdown practice.
   The shuttle fleet has been grounded since Challenger and its
crew of seven were lost in an explosion 73 seconds after liftoff
<DATE>Jan. 28, 1986</DATE>.
   Earlier this week, the space agency announced it had officially
delayed <ORGANIZATION>Discovery</ORGANIZATION>'s launch from late <DATE>August</DATE> until early <DATE>September</DATE>
because it was taking longer than expected to prepare the vehicle.

<HEAD>Soviets Plan August Launch Of New Shuttle, Magazine Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>'s new space shuttle, a
reusable craft that lands on a runway, will make its maiden voyage
at about the same time that the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> space shuttle is scheduled to
return to orbit for the first time since the Challenger disaster,
an industry magazine reports.
   Aviation Week and <ORGANIZATION>Space Technology</ORGANIZATION> released a report <DATE>Friday</DATE>
saying the Soviet shuttle will be launched in <DATE>August</DATE> and ``roughly
coincide'' with the return to flight of the American space shuttle.
   Launch of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> space shuttle is now expected in late <DATE>August</DATE>,
probably on <DATE>Aug. 29</DATE>, according to <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> sources.
   The Soviet space shuttle, which closely resembles the American
original in exterior design, is to carry two cosmonauts into orbit
in what is expected to be a short test mission.
   Earlier reports said that the Soviet shuttle's initial test
flight would be conducted unmanned, but officials disclosed last
week that the plans call for two pilots.
   Aviation Week quoted Soviet Lt. Gen. <PERSON>Vladium Shatalov</PERSON>, chief of
the Soviet space program, as saying, ``When the Americans tested
their shuttle, two men took off. I believe that this experience is
reasonable and can be used in our country.''
   The Soviet space shuttle is launched on a liquid-fueled rocket
called the <LOCATION>Energia</LOCATION>. Unlike the American craft, the launch rockets
are not a part of the orbiting craft. Instead, the Soviet shuttle
includes jet engines which can be used when the craft returns to
the atmosphere. This will give the Soviet shuttle a greater range
to manuever than the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> shuttle, which returns from space as a
glider with no engines.
   Challenger exploded shortly after launch from the <ORGANIZATION>Kennedy Space
Center</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Jan. 28, 1986</DATE>. Seven crew members were killed. Since
then, the shuttle fleet has been grounded while <ORGANIZATION>National
Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION> engineers redesigned and
tested flawed equipment, including the solid-fueled rocket engines
that were blamed for the accident.
   In <DATE>August</DATE>, space shuttle Discovery is scheduled to be launched
from the <ORGANIZATION>Kennedy Space Center</ORGANIZATION> with a crew of five, all veteran
astronauts, and land four days later at <ORGANIZATION>Edwards Air Force Base</ORGANIZATION>,
<LOCATION>Calif</LOCATION>.
   Aviation <PERSON>Week</PERSON> said the Soviet shuttle flight is part of an
``unprecedented'' series of space missions over the next three
months.
   ``Never before has the <ORGANIZATION>USSR</ORGANIZATION> attempted so many major new space
missions withing the same period,'' the magazine said.
   Among the Soviet flights are:
   _Two robot craft to be launched to Mars and to the Martian moon
Phobos. The craft will lift off on <DATE>July 7</DATE> and <DATE>July 12</DATE> for the most
complex planetary missions yet attempted by the Soviets. The craft
will include instruments provided by eight countries and the
<ORGANIZATION>European Space Agency</ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> is not participating.
   _On <DATE>June 7</DATE>, a Soyuz spacecraft with a Soviet and a Bulgarian
cosmonaut will be launched to the space station Mir for an
eight-day mission. In <DATE>August</DATE>, a second <ORGANIZATION>Soyuz</ORGANIZATION> will be launched with
a Soviet and an Afghan on board.
   _<DATE>Last Sunday</DATE>, the Soviets launched a military intelligence craft
the size of a school bus in a 530-mile circular orbit.
   Two cosmonauts aboard the space station Mir completed their
150th day in orbit last <DATE>Monday</DATE>. The <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> has now exceeded
128,000 man-hours in space, more than triple the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> total of
42,463 hours.

<HEAD>Fire in Test Engine Could Delay Space Shuttle Launch</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Engineers examined a space shuttle
main engine <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> to determine if damage it suffered in a
test-firing could delay this <DATE>summer</DATE>'s launch of the shuttle <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``Engineers have to inspect the engine and look at the data
before they can make a decision about <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION>'s launch,'' said <PERSON>Dave
Drachlis</PERSON>, a space agency spokesman at the <ORGANIZATION>Marshall Space Flight
Center</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Huntsville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ala</LOCATION>.
   The failure happened <DATE>Friday</DATE> on a test stand at the <ORGANIZATION>Stennis Space
Center</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Bay St. Louis</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Miss.</LOCATION>, during firing of a development
engine that has been ignited 23 times over several years to test new
parts for future shuttle flights.
   <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION>'s three main engines already are in place as technicians
here prepare it for a launch in late <DATE>July</DATE> or early <DATE>August</DATE> on a
classified <ORGANIZATION>Defense Department</ORGANIZATION> mission.
   <PERSON>Jerry Smelser</PERSON>, head of the engine program at the <PERSON>Marshall</PERSON> center,
said <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> needs to determine if the problem involves parts similar
to those in <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION>'s engines.
   <PERSON>Drachlis</PERSON> said the test engine operated normally until about 21
minutes into a planned firing of 22 minutes 17 seconds, when there
was a sudden shutdown and a fire. During a shuttle launch, the main
engines normally fire for about 8 minutes 30 seconds.
   There was significant damage to several internal parts, <PERSON>Drachlis</PERSON>
said.
   ``The engine did not blow up; it's still fundamentally intact,''
he said.
   The engine was flown to its manufacturer, the <ORGANIZATION>Rocketdyne Division
of Rockwell International</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Canoga Park</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Drachlis</PERSON> said
engineers would take the engine apart for detailed inspection.

<TEXT>
   A practice space shuttle countdown
was under way here today in a test leading to a firing of
<ORGANIZATION>Discovery</ORGANIZATION>'s three main engines on the launch pad <DATE>Saturday</DATE>.
   The launch team started the count at <TIME>11:33 p.m.</TIME> <DATE>Sunday</DATE>. On
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, it planned to load more than a half million gallons of
liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen propellant into the shuttle's
external fuel tank.
   It will be the first time a shuttle has been fueled since the
Challenger explosion, which killed seven astronauts on <DATE>Jan. 28,
1986</DATE>.
   When the countdown reaches 10 seconds before a mock lift-off on
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, a problem will be simulated to force a launch
postponement. Then launch crews will rehearse what's called a
72-hour turnaround.
   They will empty the fuel tank, start another countdown, refill
the tank and aim for a 20-second test firing of Discovery's main
engines at <TIME>7:30 a.m.</TIME> <DATE>Saturday</DATE>.
   The firing, with the shuttle bolted firmly on the pad, will
check modifications made to the engines and is considered critical
to Discovery being certified for the first post-Challenger shuttle
flight.
   The launch, with a five-man crew, is scheduled for early
<DATE>September</DATE>, but the date is in doubt as engineers continue to puzzle
over how to fix a small gas leak in a steering engine system that
is separate from the main engines.
   They hope to make the repair on the pad and avoid rolling
Discovery back to a hangar, a move that could delay the flight as
much as two months.
   Experts are considering several ways to reach the inaccessible
leak, including cutting a hole through the shuttle's cargo bay wall
and running a snake-like tube through the gas line in an effort to
plug it.
   The <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION> said it will
not make a decision on whether to move Discovery off the pad until
after the main engine test firing.

<TEXT>
   A space shuttle main rocket engine will
be test-fired <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> at the <ORGANIZATION>Marshall Space Flight Center</ORGANIZATION>, the
first extended firing since the roar of <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> rockets echoed
across <LOCATION>Huntsville</LOCATION> in the <DATE>1960s</DATE>.
   ``It's going to be something <LOCATION>Huntsville</LOCATION> hasn't heard for quite
awhile,'' <PERSON>Marshall</PERSON> spokesman <PERSON>Dom Amatore</PERSON> said.
   The 15-second firing is part of a series of tests on the shuttle
main engines and coincides with the city's ``Space Awareness Week.''
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> engineers want to determine how long the rocket motors,
fueled by hydrogen and oxygen from the shuttle's huge external
tank, can run if needed. The engines now operate for about eight
minutes during a shuttle launch.
   Shuttle engine No. 0208, installed in the test stand in <DATE>August</DATE>,
was ``warmed up'' in a 1.5-second start test last month.
   After this week's test, a third test firing of 45 seconds will
be scheduled in <DATE>November</DATE>. Amatore said the primary goal of the
first brief tests is to verify that <PERSON>Marshall</PERSON> can handle the firings
and whether a metal ``flame bucket'' on the test stand can handle
the rocket exhaust.
   The last test firing of a big rocket motor at <PERSON>Marshall</PERSON> was a
<ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> test on <DATE>Sept. 11, 1969</DATE>, about two months after men first set
foot on the moon.
   Marshall is <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s main propulsion center. In addition to
developing the <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> rockets, it manages space shuttle propulsion
systems, including the main engines and solid fuel booster rockets,
which are test-fired in <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION>.
   ``Space Awareness Week'' includes a visit by the crew of the
shuttle Discovery.
   The five astronaunts who flew <DATE>last month</DATE> in the first
post-Challenger shuttle mission are to be in <LOCATION>Huntsville</LOCATION> on <DATE>Thursday</DATE>
and <DATE>Friday</DATE> to thank <PERSON>Marshall</PERSON> engineers.
   They also will lead a parade and appear at a public reception
<DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   On <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, singer <PERSON>John Denver</PERSON> and former <LOCATION>New Mexico</LOCATION> senator
and Apollo astronaut <PERSON>Harrison Schmitt</PERSON> will be in town to discuss
proposed new space missions.
   <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION>, who hopes to ride into orbit with a Soviet crew in <DATE>1990</DATE>,
will talk about Earth observation missions while <PERSON>Schmitt</PERSON> will
discuss proposals for manned missions to the moon and Mars.

   To bystanders, it looked as if the
contestants were trying to fish from the third-floor balcony of the
<ORGANIZATION>Massachusetts Institute of Technology</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
   In fact, the students and teachers were competing in an
experiment that could alter how spacecraft dock in outer space.
   The competition's long-range goal was to devise a cheaper, more
effective method of linking the space shuttle with the space
station. Present space shuttle docking plans are expensive and
time-consuming, said <ORGANIZATION>MIT</ORGANIZATION> Professor <PERSON>Andreas H. von Flotow</PERSON>.
   The simulated design contest was sponsored by von <ORGANIZATION>Flotow and
Energy Sciences Laboratory Inc.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>. The <MONEY>$500</MONEY> first prize
and a possible job with the company was offered to the competitor
who completed the docking maneuver in the shortest time.
   The experiment involved dropping a tether line from a third-floor
balcony in the <ORGANIZATION>MIT</ORGANIZATION> lobby, or the ``space station,'' and trying to
connect it with the ``space shuttle'' on the floor below, fashioned
from a garbage can and contestant-made nose cones.
   The trick was linking the tether to the space shuttle as rapidly
as possible without risking hard impact. But the link had to be
strong enough to lift the simulated space station off the floor.
   ``This idea has been drifting around for years,'' said von
<PERSON>Flotow</PERSON>, an assistant professor of aeronautics and astronautics at
<ORGANIZATION>MIT</ORGANIZATION>. ``But the aerospace business is the most conservative around.
They don't always want to try new things, even if there are
considerable benefits.''
   Von <PERSON>Flotow</PERSON> said several aerospace companies had expressed
interest in seeing the winning design.
   Currently, the plans for a shuttle-space station docking call for
what is termed metal-to-metal mating, which requires hours of
precision flying to dock a relatively small payload.
   Since the cost of docking is estimated to be about <MONEY>$100,000</MONEY> per
second, substantial savings can result from finding a faster
procedure, von <PERSON>Flotow</PERSON> said.
   Von <PERSON>Flotow</PERSON> said docking would require less fuel if a soft device
on a miles-long tether were dropped from the orbiting space station
to dock remotely with the space shuttle's payload at a sub-orbital
altitude.
   He said several of the designs attempted <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> could work in
space, where tether lines would be required to lift 6,600 pounds of
weight.
   Four teams of contestants competed in the two-hour experiment.
The winner, <ORGANIZATION>MIT</ORGANIZATION> graduate student <PERSON>Siegfried Zerweckh</PERSON>, used a fishnet
attached to the tether line to grasp a nose cone made of foam
rubber. His best time was 9.9 seconds.
   MIT Professor <PERSON>Norman Ham</PERSON>, the only faculty member to compete,
lowered two balloons and hooked them to cylindrical wires attached
to the nose cone in a 19-second docking maneuver.
   To ensure that the simulated docking mechanisms would not damage
a space shuttle, von <PERSON>Flotow</PERSON> tested each of the entries by dropping
them on an egg and making sure they did not break it.
   ``It's something you can create and develop and at the same time
it may prove really useful some day,'' said <PERSON>Gary Carr</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>U.S.
Department of Transportation</ORGANIZATION> mechanical engineer who was on the only
non-MIT participant in the contest.

   ``We are embarking on the second golden age of space science,''
said <PERSON>Lennard Fisk</PERSON>, the agency's associate administrator for space
science and applications. ``What's coming up is an era of

continuously from next year until <DATE>2006</DATE>, <PERSON>Fisk</PERSON> said during a visit to
<ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   Fisk was at the lab to watch Voyager 2's brush with <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> <DATE>last

<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1979</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1981</DATE> and Uranus in <DATE>1986</DATE>.
   ``In many ways, this is the end of an era, the last time we will
see a planet for a first time, the end of the reconnaissance phase
of planetary explorations,'' he said. There are no plans to explore
<LOCATION>Pluto</LOCATION>, the only planet still not visited by a spacecraft
   But <PERSON>Fisk</PERSON> listed several missions that will orbit planets rather
than fly past them:
   _<ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>, launched from a space shuttle last <DATE>May</DATE>, arrives at
Venus next <DATE>August</DATE> and will study that planet for several years.
   _<ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will be launched from the shuttle Atlantis on <DATE>Oct. 12</DATE>,
arriving in orbit around <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1996</DATE> and studying the planet
until the end of the century.
   _The <ORGANIZATION>Hubble Space Telescope</ORGANIZATION> is due for launch from a shuttle next
<DATE>March</DATE>, and is so powerful that from its orbit around <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> it will
be able to ``observe the universe back to the beginning of time,''
<PERSON>Fisk</PERSON> said.
   _Mars Observer will be launched in <DATE>1992</DATE>, reaching the red planet
in <DATE>1993</DATE> and studying it until <DATE>1996</DATE>.
   _<ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> has asked <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> to approve the Comet Rendevous-Asteroid
Flyby and <ORGANIZATION>Cassini</ORGANIZATION> missions, <PERSON>Fisk</PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION>CRAF</ORGANIZATION> would fly past an
asteroid, then orbit a comet from <DATE>2000 through 2002</DATE>, <PERSON>Fisk</PERSON> said. The
similar spacecraft on the <ORGANIZATION>Cassini</ORGANIZATION> mission would drop a probe onto
<ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION>'s moon <ORGANIZATION>Titan</ORGANIZATION>, then orbit <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> from <DATE>2002</DATE> through <DATE>2006</DATE>.
   Fisk disputed assertions that unmanned space exploration will
suffer financially because of the shuttle program, saying that <PERCENT>70
percent</PERCENT> to <PERCENT>80 percent</PERCENT> of non-military shuttle flights will be
dedicated to space science.
   <PERSON>Fisk</PERSON> said space science studies suffered in recent years not from
a lack of funds, but because of delays in developing the shuttle and
the <DATE>1986</DATE> explosion that destroyed the shuttle Challenger and halted
launches until last <DATE>fall</DATE>.

   Space shuttle Discovery made its
long-delayed trip to the launch pad today, cheered on by
flag-waving workers who have waited 2{ years for a rebirth of the
American space program.
   ``<LOCATION>America</LOCATION>, the dream is still alive,'' astronaut <PERSON>Dave Hilmers</PERSON>
told a Fourth of <DATE>July</DATE> crowd of several hundred engineers,
technicians and others who watched as the 85-ton spaceship edged
out of an assembly building into the glare of floodlights at <TIME>12:50
a.m.</TIME>
   ``What more fitting present can we make to our country than this
on the day of its birthday,'' said <PERSON>Hilmers</PERSON>, one of five crew
members scheduled to fly Discovery on the first post-Challenger
mission, set for early <DATE>September</DATE>.
   Discovery, attached to its external fuel tank and two solid-fuel
booster rockets, was perched on the broad back of a giant tracked
transporter that lumbered along at less than 1 mph in covering the
4.2-mile route to the pad in 6{ hours.
   The shuttle arrived at Pad 39B at <TIME>7:30 a.m.</TIME>, and technicians
began connecting its various systems to the launch tower, including
air-conditioning and electricity, and extending platforms from the
pad so workers can have access to the shuttle.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> scheduled the move in the early morning to avoid
thunderstorms and lightning that are common during the daytime in
the <DATE>summer</DATE> months.
   For three hours, starting at <TIME>8 a.m.</TIME>, space center workers and
their families were permitted to drive personal cars past the
launch pad for a good look at <ORGANIZATION>Discovery</ORGANIZATION> before a service structure
enclosed it.
   A recording of ``The Star Spangled Banner'' was played as the
shuttle began the move to Launch Pad 39B, the same pad from which
Challenger was launched on the flight that killed seven astronauts
on <DATE>Jan. 28, 1986</DATE>.
   ``It's been a long 2{ years since Challenger, and I'm very
pleased with the progress we've made during that time,'' <PERSON>Forrest S.
McCartney</PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION>Kennedy Space Center</ORGANIZATION>, said at the
rollout ceremony. ``It's been a team effort. ... This is a proud
day.''
   McCartney presented <PERSON>Hilmers</PERSON> with a book containing the names of
more than 15,000 <ORGANIZATION>Kennedy Space Center</ORGANIZATION> workers who have labored to
return the shuttle fleet to space.
   <PERSON>Hilmers</PERSON> said the astronauts would carry the book, bearing the
inscription ``The <ORGANIZATION>KSC</ORGANIZATION> team is with you,'' into orbit aboard
Discovery, ``knowing that our journey will be safer because of
you.''
   ``It kind of brings tears to your eyes after so long a time of
struggling and looking at ourselves inwardly and outwardly, and
here it is; it's finally a reality,'' <PERSON>Hilmers</PERSON> said.
   ``This is what I call a happy Fourth of <DATE>July</DATE>,'' said astronaut
<PERSON>Bob Crippen</PERSON>, a veteran of four shuttle flights who is now deputy
director of shuttle operations.
   Workers were to spend several hours securing Discovery on the
pad and then begin preparing it for a critical test-firing of its
three main liquid fuel engines. The test, with the spaceship bolted
firmly on its launch mounts, is set for <DATE>July 24</DATE>.
   The following day, a final pre-flight test-firing of the
redesigned solid-fuel booster rocket is planned at the <ORGANIZATION>Morton
Thiokol</ORGANIZATION> plant in <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION>. Both tests must be passed before Discovery
is certified for flight.
   The failure of a seal in a booster rocket joint doomed
Challenger 73 seconds after liftoff. Since then, the booster has
been significantly redesigned and tested, and hundreds of other
modifications have been made to the shuttle main engines and other
systems.
   <PERSON>Hilmers</PERSON> and four other veteran shuttle crew members will be at
the controls when Discovery blasts off on a four-day mission. The
others are commander <PERSON>Rick Hauck</PERSON>, <PERSON>Dick Covey</PERSON>, <PERSON>Mike Lounge</PERSON> and <PERSON>George
Nelson</PERSON>.
   They will deploy a communications satellite, conduct scientific
and technical experiments and check out changes made to the orbiter
systems.

<TEXT>
   Soviet space scientists declared a brilliant
success the unmanned maiden voyage of the space shuttle Buran, and
are planning a much longer second mission, <ORGANIZATION>Tass</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
   ``The previous program was brilliantly performed; when the craft
came to a halt on the runway its time deviation from the program
reached only one second, while the deviation of the Buran's axis
from that of the runway was only 1.5 meters,'' the official news
agency reported.
   Only five of the 39,000 heat-protecting tiles broke away during
the 3-hour, 20-minute flight <DATE>Nov. 15</DATE> and the spacecraft, whose name
means Snowstorm in Russian, successfully maneuvered in bad weather,
<ORGANIZATION>Tass</ORGANIZATION> said.
   It quoted Gen. <PERSON>German Titov</PERSON> as saying: ``We deliberately refused
to postpone the launch and wait for ideal conditions. The value of
the flight is that its program included the maximum sum of real and
rather difficult tasks.''
   Tass said the landing took place in relatively high winds and
thick clouds.
   Officials have said the shuttle's second flight also will be
unmanned. No precise information on its length was available.
   Cosmonauts on another Soviet space mission, a joint project
including French cosmonaut <PERSON>Jean-Loup Chretien</PERSON>, began working aboard
the orbiting space station Mir on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, a day after docking their
Soyuz TM-7 capsule.
   Chretien will return with <PERSON>Vladimir Titov</PERSON> and <PERSON>Musa Manarov</PERSON>, who
have set an endurance record and will have been in space a full year
when they make the descent <DATE>Dec. 21</DATE>. Commander <PERSON>Alexander Volkov</PERSON> and
<PERSON>Sergei Krikalev</PERSON>, who went into space with the Frenchman, will remain
on the Mir until <DATE>April</DATE>.
   Tass said one project, designed by French scientists, is to make
a detailed study of the cardio-vascular system in space flight,
using ultra sound to evaluate blood flow.

   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>today</DATE> it will not try to
launch space shuttle Atlantis and the robot probe targeted for
Venus until a fuel pump problem and leaking fuel line are corrected
on the space shuttle and ``we don't know when we can go.''
   Sources close to the program reported earlier that the
postponement could be at least 10 days, but later said that was
based on a preliminary assessment. They said the delay will be
several days and possibly could stretch to a week or more if
technicians have to replace both the pump and the fuel line.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> spokesperson <PERSON>Lisa Malone</PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> officials are evaluating
the problems today and have assigned committees to study each
element. She reports from those committees will be made on <DATE>Sunday</DATE>.
   ``We don't know when we can go,'' said <PERSON>Malone</PERSON>. ``It depends on
where the troubleshooting takes us.''
   A launch countdown was stopped <DATE>Friday</DATE> with just 31 seconds left
after controllers detected an electrical power surge in a main
engine fuel pump. Later, engineers found leak in a hydrogen fuel
line.
   Atlantis is to carry into space a robot probe called <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>
which is to fly to the planet <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> in a resumption of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s
exploration of the solar system after an 11-year gap.
   Earlier, <PERSON>Robert Sieck</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>Kennedy Space Center</ORGANIZATION> launch director,
said technicians would remove panels of the engine compartment to
get at the pump.
   The leaky hydrogen line, which spewed a cloud of vapor toward
the end of the countdown, also must be repaired, <PERSON>Sieck</PERSON> said.
Engineers believe the vapor escaped through a pinhole in a fitting.
   The technicians worked through the <TIME>night</TIME> to drain a half million
gallons of oxygen and hydrogen rocket fuel from <LOCATION>Atlantis</LOCATION>. They then
planned to install scaffolding at the base of the spacecraft and
remove panels covering the engine compartment.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>George Diller</PERSON> said engineers should be able to
examine the faulty pump by tonight. Only then can it be determined
how the problem will be corrected. The experts looked at the leaky
hydrogen line <TIME>this morning</TIME>, but were still undecided on what
repairs were needed for that problem, he said.
   If either the pump or the hydrogen line have to be replaced, the
launch could be postponed until ``well into next week,'' <PERSON>Sieck</PERSON> said.
   Atlantis couldn't be launched before <DATE>Monday</DATE> at the earliest
because of the two problems, he said.
   ``Both of them would have to fall into a quick fix and it would
be optimistic to expect that,'' <PERSON>Sieck</PERSON> said.
   Among tens of thousands who had gathered for the planned rare
afternoon liftoff were prominent planetary scientists who have been
waiting to resume solar system exploration since <DATE>1978</DATE>, when
Pioneer-Venus was launched on the last <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> planetary expedition.
   ``We have waited a number of years for this flight, and a few
extra days won't matter,'' said <PERSON>Lennard Fisk</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s chief
scientist. ``The window is a month long. Having the shuttle ready
on the first day is ample time to solve the problem and get us on
our way to Venus.''
   ``That's just the way it is,'' said <PERSON>James Head</PERSON>, a geologist from
<ORGANIZATION>Brown University</ORGANIZATION>.
   The space agency must send the <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> probe on its way by <DATE>May
28</DATE> to take advantage of the proper alignment between <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and
<PERSON>Venus</PERSON>. If <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> can't meet that deadline, officials would have to
wait two years before the two planets again are in the desired
position.
   After the scrub was announced, the astronauts climbed out of the
spaceship in their bright orange launch suits and were taken back
to the crew quarters for a late lunch.
   The crew includes commander <PERSON>David Walker</PERSON>, along with pilot
<PERSON>Ronald J. Grabe</PERSON>, <PERSON>Mary L. Cleave</PERSON>, <PERSON>Norman E. Thagard</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mark C. Lee</PERSON>.
   <PERSON>Sieck</PERSON> said the preparations seemed ``picture perfect'' until 20
minutes before launch.
   A computer malfunction was quickly fixed and the count resumed
after a six-minute delay. Then, with fewer than 50 seconds left on
the clock, an engineer in the launch control room told <PERSON>Sieck</PERSON>,
``Possible problem with an engine 1 recirculation pump ...
recommend hold at T-minus 31.''
   The countdown was stopped.
   ``It just wasn't our day,'' <PERSON>Sieck</PERSON> said. He fretted out loud that
the weather, perfect on <DATE>Friday</DATE>, would likely be less ideal next
week.
   After it is released from Atlantis' cargo bay, <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> will
rocket itself onto a 15-month, 806 million-mile path toward <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>,
the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s nearest planetary neighbor.
   The explorer craft will spend eight months orbiting <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> and
mapping about <PERCENT>90 percent</PERCENT> of the planet surface using a
sophisticated radar system.
   Venus is a cloud-shrouded world that has always intrigued
scientists because it is about the size of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, but lacks any of
the conditions that make life on this planet possible.

   A two-minute test of an experimental

   ``It went perfectly,'' <PERSON>Marshall</PERSON> Director <PERSON>Jack Lee</PERSON> said.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> engineers said data from the test would be analyzed by

for the main combustion chamber may be a feature of space shuttles
by <DATE>1995</DATE>.
   The throat is designed to allow the engine to run at lower
pressures and temperatures than now exist on the space shuttle.
   The last test on <DATE>June 22</DATE> was automatically shut down after 40
seconds because nitrogen contaminated the engine's liquid hydrogen

<TEXT>
   In a corrugated metal complex that
reverberates with echoes of aerospace history, a team of 1,000
workers is building a replacement for the ill-fated space shuttle
Challenger.
   The new orbiter vehicle is as yet unnamed. It is a collection of
titanium forgings, machined parts and electronic boxes known at
this stage of production only as OV-105.
   Its letter-number designator sounds more fitting for a robot in
a ``Star Wars'' film than a spacecraft in a fleet of shuttles
bestowed the stately titles of <LOCATION>Atlantis</LOCATION>, Discovery and <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``It's not our job to give it a name,'' shuttle production chief
<PERSON>Seymour Z. Rubenstein</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Rockwell International</ORGANIZATION>, the principal
shuttle contractor, said cheerfully in a recent interview. ``That's
the government's job.''
   Actually, the replacement shuttle's name will be the brainstorm
of school children who submit entries in a national competition
that opens this <DATE>fall</DATE>.
   After several elimination rounds, the administrator of the
<ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION> will select a winner
in <DATE>May 1989</DATE>, said <PERSON>Bill Green</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Rockwell International</ORGANIZATION> spokesman.
   Only one thing is certain about the name.
   ``It definitely won't be Challenger 2, or anything like that,''
Green said.
   While OV-105 waits for a name, about 100 subcontractors and
2,000 <ORGANIZATION>Rockwell</ORGANIZATION> shuttle program workers are giving the <MONEY>$1.3 billion</MONEY>
orbiter its shape in <LOCATION>Downey</LOCATION>, a suburb of <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, and in
<LOCATION>Palmdale</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>Mojave Desert</LOCATION> city 50 miles north of <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>
where final assembly is to take place.
   Already, the space vehicle's wings have sailed through the
<LOCATION>Panama Canal</LOCATION> from <ORGANIZATION>Grumman Corp.</ORGANIZATION> on <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Long Island</LOCATION> on their
journey to the <LOCATION>Mojave Desert</LOCATION>. The nozzles that guide the orbiter as
it flies through space hail from <ORGANIZATION>McDonnell Douglas Corp.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>St.
Louis</LOCATION>. Other key components are made at <ORGANIZATION>Rockwell</ORGANIZATION> facilities in
<LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, and additional parts are being flown in from
dozens of other locations across the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>.
   When the new shuttle is finished, it will look almost exactly
like the three others in the fleet.
   ``Essentially it will look the same,'' said <PERSON>Rubenstein</PERSON>,
president of <ORGANIZATION>Rockwell's Space Transportation Systems Division</ORGANIZATION>.
   That there are no drastic changes from previous shuttles is a
point of pride for <PERSON>Rubenstein</PERSON>, one of the principal original
designers of the shuttle.
   ``No other country could have built it,'' he said. ``It's a
well-designed product built by a tremendously dedicated work
force.''
   Even though it looks the same as earlier orbiters, it will
incorporate all the improvements found necessary by the <ORGANIZATION>Rogers
Commission</ORGANIZATION>, which investigated the launch disaster that took the
lives of the Challenger crew 2{ years ago.
   Most notable is a crew escape system _ a telescoping pole the
crew could use to slide down and then parachute to the ground or
into the water. Such a bailout system, a version of which was added
to Discovery before its current flight, could not have saved the
Challenger crew.
   The new shuttle also will have upgraded electronics and an
improved braking system, changes that also are being incorporated
into the rest of the shuttle fleet.
   Like its predecessors, OV-105 is taking shape in a complex where
the Apollo capsule and <ORGANIZATION>Apollo-Soyuz</ORGANIZATION> command modules were built.
<ORGANIZATION>Rockwell</ORGANIZATION> also built the X-15 rocket plane and the P-51 Mustang
fighter plane.
   ``This company is rich in aviation and space heritage,''
<PERSON>Rubenstein</PERSON> said., ``The company has a history of building aircraft
and spacecraft that were on the leading edge.''
   <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> gave the go-ahead to build the replacement shuttle on
<DATE>July 31, 1987</DATE>. It is scheduled to be delivered in <DATE>April 1991</DATE> and
fly in space in <DATE>1992</DATE>.
   Work on production and assembly of the new orbiter is nearly
half complete because the company got approval in <DATE>1983</DATE> to built a
set of ``structural spare parts.'' The spares were actually key
components of a shuttle superstructure that were to be used if a
shuttle was ever damaged.
   ``No one had planned on the loss of a vehicle,'' <PERSON>Rubenstein</PERSON> said.
   But, after Challenger, the spare parts functioned ``like an
insurance policy'' in speeding production of the replacement
orbiter. Many major shuttle components, like the aft fuselage
section, take as long as five years to machine because they must be
forged from titanium and measured to a high degree of precision.

   An astronaut scheduled to command a space
shuttle flight next year and two high <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> officials announced
their resignations <DATE>Monday</DATE>, with two saying their decisions were
prompted by new federal retirement regulations.
   Astronaut <PERSON>Jon A. McBride</PERSON>, 45, announced he will retire from <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>
on <DATE>May 12</DATE> and will retire from the <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> in ``the near future.''
   <PERSON>Noel W. Hinners</PERSON>, the third-ranking executive in <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>, said he
will retire on <DATE>May 14</DATE>, the day before new post-retirement
regulations for government employees go into effect.
   <PERSON>James B. Odom</PERSON>, 55, chief of <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s space station program,
announced he is retiring next <DATE>Sunday</DATE> and blamed the sudden decision
on ``the impact of some upcoming changes on government retirees.''
   McBride, a captain in the <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION>, was scheduled to command the
STS-35 space shuttle mission set for launch next <DATE>March</DATE>. <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>
announced that veteran astronaut <PERSON>Vance D. Brand</PERSON> would take over
that job.
   McBride was selected as an astronaut in <DATE>1978</DATE> and flew into space
one time, as pilot on an <DATE>October 1984</DATE> shuttle mission. He had been
scheduled to command a mission in <DATE>March 1986</DATE>, but the flight was
deferred when the shuttle fleet was grounded following the <DATE>Jan. 28,
1986</DATE>, explosion of space shuttle Challenger.
   ``I've spent an extremely rewarding 25 years with <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> and the
<ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON>McBride</PERSON> said in a statement released by the <ORGANIZATION>Johnson Space
Center</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION>. ``This move has been a very difficult decision
for me. But in the final analysis, I felt it was time to make a
career change and return to <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION>.''
   <PERSON>Hinners</PERSON> blamed his decision to retire on what he called
``uncertainty in interpretation of new post-employment laws.''
   A geologist and geochemist, <PERSON>Hinners</PERSON> served as chief scientist
for <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>. He began his space career in <DATE>1963</DATE> by helping to plan the
scientific exploration of the moon during the Apollo program. He
later served as director of the <ORGANIZATION>National Air and Space Museum</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> and director of the <ORGANIZATION>Goddard Space Flight Center</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>Hinners</PERSON>
joined the <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> senior management team in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> in <DATE>1987</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Odom</PERSON>, a 33-year veteran of <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>, has headed the space station
program for a year. The agency is in the midst of a major push to
persuade <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> to budget funds for starting construction on the
station.
   ``I regret the timing of my decision, but the impact of some
upcoming changes on government retirees made it such that I did not
get to pick the most desirable or optimum time to retire,'' said
<PERSON>Odom</PERSON> in a statement.
   Odom started his space career as a rocket engineer with the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION>
in <DATE>1956</DATE>, and transferred to <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Marshall Space Flight Center</ORGANIZATION> in
<DATE>1959</DATE>. He helped to develop the external tank used on the space
shuttle and the space telescope which will be launched next year.
   A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space
Administration</ORGANIZATION> said that regulations going into effect <DATE>May 15</DATE> will
restrict the freedom of retired <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> executives to go to work for
commercial aerospace companies.
   The spokesman, who asked not to be named, also said that some
<ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> officials feel they must leave before the rules take effect
``to take care of their families.''
   ``There will probably be some more (resignations),'' the
spokesman said.

   Atlantis outwaited fickle weather
and streaked into orbit today, carrying five astronauts who will
dispatch the <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> probe to cloud-shrouded <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> for the best
look yet at <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s nearest neighbor.
   The winged space shuttle thundered smoothly into the <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> sky
at <TIME>2:47 p.m. EDT</TIME>, after being delayed a nail-biting 59 minutes by
shifting rain clouds and winds that had threatened a second
postponement in six days. <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> had 64 minutes in which to launch
today and used all but five minutes of that time.
   ``It was another cliff-hanger,'' said acting <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> administrator
<PERSON>Dale Meyers</PERSON>.
   The launch starts a 15-month journey of 806 million miles for
the robot explorer craft <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>, the first American deep space
probe in 11 years. The <MONEY>$550 million</MONEY> craft, which had to be launched
by <DATE>May 28</DATE> or wait two years, is carrying to Venus a powerful radar
system that will map most of the planet. <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> is named for the
16th-century Portuguese explorer.
   Atlantis, riding a 700-foot cascade of flame, rose majestically
from its beachside launch pad into a blue, nearly cloudless sky,
rolled slowly on its planned path and streaked up and out of view.
   Two solid-fueled rocket booster rockets burned out after 2
minutes, six seconds, precisely on schedule, and were jettisoned.
Atlantis flew on, powered by its liquid-fueled rockets.
   The successful launch came despite dark clouds and showers
earlier in the day. By late in the launch window, sea breezes had
swept the skies and crosswinds were below the permitted 14 mph at
the <ORGANIZATION>Kennedy Space Center</ORGANIZATION> emergency landing site.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s first attempt to launch Atlantis last <DATE>Friday</DATE> was halted
just 31 seconds before liftoff when a flaw was detected in a fuel
pump. Later, engineers also found what appeared to be a leak in a
hydrogen fuel line. Both parts were replaced.
   The crew members for the mission, the 29th shuttle flight and
the fourth since the Challenger disaster, are commander <PERSON>David M.
Walker</PERSON>, pilot <PERSON>Ronald Grabe</PERSON>, and mission specialists <PERSON>Norman Thagard</PERSON>,
<PERSON>Mary Cleave</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mark Lee</PERSON>.
   Six hours after launch, Cleave and Lee operate remote controls
to eject <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> from the shuttle's cargo bay. A powerful rocket
will then send <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> out of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> orbit and start it on a voyage
that will carry it 1{ times around the sun before reaching <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>.
   Atlantis is to spend four days orbiting 184 miles above <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>
while the crew operates scientific experiments. Landing is set for
<DATE>Monday</DATE> at <ORGANIZATION>Edwards Air Force Base</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Calif</LOCATION>.
   Today's launch opportunity was determined by the path <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>
must follow to reach <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s mysterious neighbor. If the launch had
been postponed, there would have been daily launch opportunities
until <DATE>May 28</DATE>. At that point, <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> would have moved out
of alignment and the <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> mission would not be possible for two
years.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> marks the beginning of a new era in a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> planetary
exploration program that has not had a launch since <DATE>1978</DATE>.
   Venus has fascinated since humans first began scanning the sky.
It is the brightest object in the nighttime sky, except for the
moon. It appears in season as either the morning or the evening
``star,'' but <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> is actually a planet that orbits 67 million
miles from the sun. The <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> orbits 93 million miles from the sun.
   Scientists are intrigued by <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> because it is so close in size
to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, yet much different in most every other way. Venus rotates
the opposite direction of the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, which means the sun rises in
the west. Its rotation is so slow that a Venusian day lasts 243
Earth days.
   Venus is shrouded with dense clouds and its surface cannot be
seen by telescopes on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, giving the planet an aura of mystery.
   Space probes in recent years have proven that <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' surface
temperature is about 900 degrees, hot enough to melt lead. The
atmosphere is carbon dioxide at intense pressures, with
high-altitude clouds of sulfuric acid.
   The torrid heat long ago boiled away any water that was on the
planet, but probes have hinted of vast mountain ranges, towering
volcanoes, and barren plains.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> will rendezvous with <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> in <DATE>August 1990</DATE>. It will
settle into an elongated orbit, sooping to within 155 miles of the
surface, and then sweeping out to a high point of almost 5,000
miles.
   The 3{-ton spacecraft carries an imaging radar that will give
the clearest picture yet of Venus. The radar is able to penetrate
the cloud cover and detect surface features as small as a football
field.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> is expected to map about <PERCENT>90 percent</PERCENT> of Venus. The radar
will operate during 2,000 passes over the planet, each time viewing
a slice of surface and sending the image back to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> for computer
enhancement. The mapping expedition is expected to last about eight
months.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> is the first in a series of deep space probes and marks
what <PERSON>Lennard Fisk</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space
Administration</ORGANIZATION>'s chief scientist, called ``a resurgence of
<LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s planetary program.''
   Pioneer-Venus, in <DATE>1978</DATE>, was the last <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> space launch and <PERSON>Fisk</PERSON>
said <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> ``had a planetary program that was in danger of being
an also-ran.''
   Voyager 2, launched in <DATE>1977</DATE>, will fly past <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> in <DATE>August</DATE>. It
earlier visted <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> and Uranus. In <DATE>October</DATE>, the robot
craft <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will be launched toward <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>. A space telescope
will be launched next year, followed by probes to the sun in <DATE>1990</DATE>,
and to <ORGANIZATION>Mars</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1992</DATE>.
   ``Nobody is going to question our leadership in planetary
(exploration) again,'' said <PERSON>Fisk</PERSON>.

<HEAD>Countdown Set to Begin Tonight</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new countdown begins tonight for a
22-second firing of space shuttle Discovery's three main engines, a
vital test that has been postponed five times because of
malfunctions.
   If this test succeeds, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> officials will set a date for the
first American manned space flight since the Challenger burst into
flames on liftoff in <DATE>January 1986</DATE>. The Discovery launch date,
already officially moved four times, is not likely to be before
<DATE>October</DATE> because of all the test delays.
   The flight readiness firing, as it's called, is an overall
workout of the main engines, computer software, ground support
equipment, communications lines and the launch teams.
   The ``call to stations'' that begins the countdown was scheduled
for <TIME>6:10 p.m.</TIME> with the test set for <TIME>7:30 a.m.</TIME> <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>. Without
further problems, fueling of the shuttle's huge tank begins a half
hour before <TIME>midnight</TIME>.
   The shuttle's No. 2 engine is fitted with a new ``hydrogen bleed
valve'' and sensor to replace units that caused a scheduled test to
be scrapped <DATE>last Thursday</DATE> in the split second before the start of
ignition.
   ``The recovery from the problem on <DATE>Thursday</DATE> shows that the team
is working smoothly and I am expecting an on-time engine firing on
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME>,'' said <PERSON>Hugh Harris</PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s
<ORGANIZATION>Kennedy Space Center</ORGANIZATION>.
   Discovery's three engines will be fired with slightly different
start and stop times, using only a portion of the half million
gallons of fuel in the external tank.
   Bolts 3 feet long and 3 inches in diameter hold the shuttle to
the pad while the engines generate 1.1 million pounds of thrust.
   The two solid fuel rocket boosters flanking the shuttle tank
will not be ignited but will be subjected to the same bending
movements that led to a leak in one of the joints during
Challenger's liftoff. That leak allowed flame to escape and led to
the shuttle's destruction and the deaths of seven astronauts.
   Flight readiness firings have been required in the past for new
shuttles only, except for one time when a malfunction made a retest
necessary. But the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION> is
treating Discovery as an untried ship because of the long time
since the last flight and the many changes since the Challenger
disaster.
   Last <DATE>Thursday</DATE>'s engine test was aborted in the last second when
a sensor reported that a valve had not closed as it was supposed
to. Engineers determined that the sensor, not the valve, was
malfunctioning but decided to replace both parts.
   The designer of the shuttle rocket booster, meanwhile, announced
<DATE>Monday</DATE> that the last of five full-scale test-firings for the
booster will be held <DATE>Aug. 18</DATE>.
   The fifth in the series of firings of the 126-foot-long
redesigned rocket will be conducted at <ORGANIZATION>Morton Thiokol Inc.</ORGANIZATION>'s
northern <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION> plant.

   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> officials said <DATE>Monday</DATE> they still have not
pinpointed the mysterious hydrogen leak that grounded the space
shuttle fleet, even though engineers repeated the leak in
laboratory tests.
   <ORGANIZATION>Rockwell International</ORGANIZATION> engineers detected escaping hydrogen in a
weekend test of hardware from space shuttle <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION>, but <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>
space flight director <PERSON>William Lenoir</PERSON> said engineers still don't
know the precise valve, pipe or seal in the complex plumbing of the
liquid hydrogen rocket fuel system that is leaking.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Rockwell</ORGANIZATION> test, in effect, proved that the leak was related
to the design or assembly of the equipment. <PERSON>Lenoir</PERSON> said the next
step now is to find the exact source.
   ``My biggest fear was that we would go through the <PERSON>Downey</PERSON> test
and get no leak at all,'' said <PERSON>Lenoir</PERSON>. ``I'm encouraged.''
   Finding no leak, officials said, would have made the leak even
more puzzling and more difficult to repair.
   Space shuttle program director <PERSON>Robert Crippen</PERSON> cautioned that
although the leak discovery is important ``we really do not know
what the problem is yet. We haven't eliminated anything yet.''
   An even more important leak test is planned for <DATE>Friday</DATE> or
<DATE>Saturday</DATE> on space shuttle Atlantis, which is on a launch pad at the
<ORGANIZATION>Kennedy Space Center</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Lenoir</PERSON> said the ``prime suspect'' for the source of the leak is
a U-shaped Teflon seal that is supposed to keep hydrogen from
leaking from what is called a disconnect. This disconnect is in a
17-inch hydrogen pipe that pulls apart when the shuttle rocket
propellant tank is jettisoned after launch.
   Rockwell engineers at the company's <LOCATION>Downey</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, plant found
the leak during weekend tests when liquid hydrogen was pumped
through an apparatus of pipes, seals and valves, called an
umbilical, which had been removed from the shuttle <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION>.
   The umbilical carries rocket propellant from the shuttle's large
orange tank to the rocket engines in the orbiter, the winged
spacecraft that carries the astronauts. The 17-inch disconnect
separates halves of the umbilical.
   The umbilical also is used to load the fuel tank before launch.
The hydrogen leak on <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION> was first detected in <DATE>May</DATE>, when
technicians were pumping the supercold hydrogen on board. The
mission was postponed and the umbilical on <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION> was removed and
sent to <ORGANIZATION>Rockwell</ORGANIZATION> for testing.
   A second hydrogen leak was found on Atlantis last month. As a
precaution, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> grounded all three shuttles until the leaks are
fixed.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Rockwell</ORGANIZATION> test was a laboratory experiment that did not
exactly duplicate the conditions that occurred when <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION>'s leak
was detected, said <PERSON>Lenoir</PERSON>. He said it was a static test that
attempted to match the pressures and the minus 420 degree
temperature of liquid hydrogen, but it could not match the 84
gallon-a-minute flow used when the tank is being filled.
   The test late this week on Atlantis will match all conditions of
the earlier leaks. Lenoir and <PERSON>Crippen</PERSON> said that Atlantis' umbilical
is being outfitted with sensors and with plastic bags to capture
and detect leaking hydrogen. It is hoped that the test will help to
isolated the source of the leak.
   But <PERSON>Crippen</PERSON> noted, ``We have not eliminated the possibility that
we might have two different problems on the two different
vehicles.''
   Liquid hydrogen is at minus 420 degrees when it is pumped into
the shuttle fuel tank. Preflight tests of the umbilical had been
conducted in the past using liquid nitrogen or helium, both of
which are warmer than liquid hydrogen. The pipes and valves on
<ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION> and Atlantis had passed the nitrogen and helium tests.
   It was only when the supercold hydrogen was pumped on board that
the leaks occurred.
   Rockwell engineers used liquid hydrogen, but <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>Kyle
Herring</PERSON> said the rate of flow in the laboratory experiment is
slower than what is used when the tank is being filled.
   The shuttles' main rocket engines burn liquid hydrogen and
liquid oxygen. The supercold chemicals are loaded into separate
vessels inside the propellant tank, the 153-foot-long tank attached
to the belly of the orbiter during launch.
   In <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION>, meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> said it was grounding two veteran
shuttle crew commanders, <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> Cmdr. <PERSON>Robert L.</PERSON> ``Hoot'' <PERSON>Gibson</PERSON> and
<ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> Capt. <PERSON>David M. Walker</PERSON>, for violations of flight crew
operations guidelines.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON>Gibson</PERSON> was removed from shuttle flight assignments and
from T-38 jet trainer flight status for one year for violating a
policy that restricts high-risk recreational activities for
astronauts named to flight crews.
   <PERSON>Gibson</PERSON>'s stunt plane collided <DATE>Saturday</DATE> with another plane,
sending the second craft hurtling into a cornfield and killing its
pilot, <PERSON>Henry W. Jones Jr.</PERSON>, 69, a retired fighter pilot.
   Walker was suspended for a <DATE>May 1989</DATE> incident in which the pilot
of a <ORGANIZATION>Pan Am</ORGANIZATION> plane reported a ``near midair collision'' between his
aircraft and a T-38 flown by <PERSON>Walker</PERSON>.

   The nation's space agency will be led for the
first time by ``a hero of its own making,'' President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> said in
announcing he will nominate astronaut <PERSON>Richard Truly</PERSON> as
administrator of the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION>.
   The nomination, which had been expected, must be confirmed by
the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>.
   Truly, 50, has been an astronaut since <DATE>1969</DATE>, was pilot of the
second shuttle flight in <DATE>1981</DATE> and commander of the eighth in <DATE>1983</DATE>
and has been associate <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> administrator for space flight since
<DATE>1986</DATE>.
   Truly succeeds <PERSON>James C. Fletcher</PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> administrator
who resumed the position after the Challenger disaster in <DATE>January
1986</DATE>. Fletcher retired this month.
   ``This marks the first time in its distinguished history that
<ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> will be led by a hero of its own making, an astronaut who has
been to space,'' <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> told members of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> and others in the
<LOCATION>Roosevelt Room</LOCATION> of the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> also announced that he plans to nominate <PERSON>James R. Thompson
Jr.</PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Marshall Space Flight Center</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Huntsville</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Ala.</LOCATION>, to succeed <PERSON>Dale D. Myers</PERSON> as deputy administrator.
   Before his space flights, Truly was pilot for one of the two-man
crews that conducted landing tests with the space shuttle
Enterprise when it was hauled aloft on the back of a 747 jumbo jet.
   He was commissioned an ensign in the <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1959</DATE>, became a
naval aviator in <DATE>1960</DATE> and made more than 300 carrier landings. He
now holds the rank of rear admiral.
   After the Challenger disaster <DATE>Jan. 28, 1986</DATE>, Truly was in charge
of the recovery team and of redesigning the shuttle's boosters and
overhauling the shuttle safety program.
   B. <PERSON>Jay Cooper</PERSON>, deputy <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> press secretary, said <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>
had agreed to waive a requirement that the head of <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> be a
civilian.
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> said that immediately after the ceremonial announcement,
Truly was leaving for <LOCATION>Cape Canaveral</LOCATION> to take charge of the flight
readiness team for the next space shuttle flight, in which the
shuttle Atlantis will carry the <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> radar mapping device into
space.
   Truly, asked after the ceremony what his top priority would be,
said, ``To have a good flight readiness and get <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> on its way
to Venus.''

   A practice space shuttle countdown
hit a snag <DATE>Monday</DATE>, delaying a critical test-firing of <ORGANIZATION>Discovery</ORGANIZATION>'s
three main engines 24 hours, until <DATE>Sunday</DATE>.
   The postponement was announced as engineers assessed methods for
fixing a small shuttle gas leak without having to take Discovery
off the launch pad, a move that could delay the planned early
<DATE>September</DATE> launch by as much as two months.
   The launch team started the countdown late <DATE>Sunday</DATE> and fell
behind early in closing out the shuttle's rear engine compartment
on the pad. That forced a one-day delay in the loading of gases
aboard the spaceship's energy-producing fuel cells.
   The plan now calls for crews to pump more than half a million
gallons of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen into <ORGANIZATION>Discovery</ORGANIZATION>'s
external fuel tank late <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> and early <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   It will mark the first time a shuttle has been fueled since the
fleet was grounded by the Challenger explosion <DATE>Jan. 28, 1986</DATE>.
   On <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, when the countdown reaches 10 seconds before a mock
liftoff, a simulated problem is to force a postponement. Crews then
will rehearse what they call a 72-hour launch turnaround exercise.
They will empty the fuel tank, start another countdown and aim for
a test-firing of Discovery's main engines at <TIME>7:30 a.m.</TIME> <DATE>Sunday</DATE>.
   The 20-second firing, with the shuttle locked firmly on the pad,
will check modifications made to turbopumps and other engine
systems and is considered crucial to Discovery being certified for
the first post-Challenger shuttle flight.
   The launch, with a five-man crew, is scheduled for early
<DATE>September</DATE>, but the date is uncertain because of the leak in a
steering engine system that is separate from the main engines.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> officials believe that even if the leak can be fixed on the
pad, the launch will be delayed past the middle of <DATE>September</DATE>.
   Experts were considering several ways to reach and plug the
inaccessible leak, from cutting a hole through the shuttle cargo
bay wall to running a snake-like tube 20 feet through the
half-inch-diameter gas line.
   Tests over the <DATE>weekend</DATE> ruled out using the tube in two
configurations. One would have used it to deliver an expandable
Teflon balloon filled with sealant to plug the leak. In the other,
sealant would been pumped through a hollow tube to the leak.
   The tube testing is being done at the Materials and Processing
Laboratory at the <ORGANIZATION>Marshall Space Flight Center</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Huntsville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ala</LOCATION>.
Lab director <PERSON>Bob Schwinghamer</PERSON> said <DATE>Monday</DATE> the balloon and hollow
tube approaches proved impractical.
   But he said another approach, in which a badminton-like
shuttlecock is attached to the end of the ``snake,'' showed promise
in reaching the leak.
   ``We have tested it eight times successfully and it looks very
attractive,'' <PERSON>Schwinghamer</PERSON> said. He suggested that if this method
didn't work, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> then could consider cutting a hole in the cargo
bay.

<HEAD>Post-Challenger Era Includes New Generation of Astronauts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURA TOLLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Space shuttle Atlantis is carrying
two space newcomers, part of a new generation of astronauts with a
look and background unlike that of the all-white, crew-cut, All
American team who rode the Mercury capsules.
   Nine more rookies have been named to four future flights, and a
new class of astronauts is in training to fill spots vacated by
veterans who took other jobs after the shuttle Challenger exploded
on <DATE>Jan. 28, 1986</DATE>.
   The space program now has 93 men and women astronauts, with a
nearly even mix of experienced space travelers and those who have
never flown into space.
   Within 10 years, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> is expected to add more as it responds to
the demand of more shuttle flights and begins construction of the
space station.
   America's new astronauts are far different from the seven
original ones.
   The first <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> astronauts were all military test pilots, all male
and all white. All <PERSON>Jack Armstrongs</PERSON> in flight suits.
   The space shuttles, with room for up to seven crew members,
opened new opportunities.
   In <DATE>1978</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> selected women and men, pilots and non-pilots, and
black, white, Hispanic and Asian candidates.
   The newest group, chosen last year, includes the first black
woman astronaut, <PERSON>Dr. Mae C. Jemison</PERSON>, a physician, and the first
<ORGANIZATION>Coast Guardsman</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Bruce E. Melnick</PERSON>.
   Another group is scheduled to be chosen in <DATE>January 1990</DATE>. Despite
the loss of the seven Challenger astronauts, the number of
applications has increased since the accident, <ORGANIZATION>Johnson Space Center</ORGANIZATION>
spokesman <PERSON>Jeff Carr</PERSON> said.
   The competition seems to have stiffened over the years, said <PERSON>Lori
Garver</PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION>National Space Society</ORGANIZATION>, a
Washington-based space advocacy group of about 20,000 people from
the general public.
   ``I don't know how it could get more competitve from the early
days, but it seems to have done just that,'' <PERSON>Ms. Garver</PERSON> said. ``They
have experience in all kinds of areas. (<ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>) looks at the whole
person and what they have to offer.''
   The astroanuts are also more aggressive about voicing their
opinions about quality and safety since Challenger, said astronaut
<PERSON>Charles Bolden Jr.</PERSON>, a Marine colonel. ``Now, people have no qualms
about speaking out,'' he said.
   When Challenger exploded there were 95 astronauts. More than a
dozen later retired. Some returned to their military branches;
others _ like <PERSON>Sally Ride</PERSON>, the first American woman in space _ left
<ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> to pursue other careers.
   Fifteen people _ 10 military and five civilians _ were added to
the astronaut ranks in <DATE>August 1987</DATE>. Two of them are women, <PERSON>Ms.
Jemison</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jan Davis</PERSON>.
   It takes at least four years of training before an astronaut can
even be assigned to a flight, and crews generally are named a year
before their launch date, <PERSON>Ms. Davis</PERSON> said.
   ``I didn't understand before I came here how all-encompassing the
job is. We don't just flip switches and follow check lists. We've
got to understand what's going on with all these systems,'' said <PERSON>Ms.
Davis</PERSON>, who has a doctorate in mechanical engineering.
   <ORGANIZATION>Vance Brand</ORGANIZATION>, a civilian pilot who flew on two shuttle flights and
the Apollo-Soyuz joint mission, said there has been an evolution of

backgrounds.
   Hee said he expects even more diversity in the future.
   ``Space is like the American West, the Arctic or <LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION>. It's
a new locality where you can do all kinds of different things,''

<TEXT>
   The crew of space shuttle Atlantis
successfully deployed a powerful radar satellite over the <DATE>weekend</DATE>,
reportedly the chief goal of the clandestine military mission,
knowledgeable sources said <DATE>today</DATE>.
   The <MONEY>$500 million</MONEY> Lacrosse satellite reportedly was designed to
gather extremely sharp all-weather images of <ORGANIZATION>Eastern Bloc</ORGANIZATION> military
targets and would help American intelligence agencies monitor Soviet
compliance with arms control treaties.
   The sources, who requested anonymity, said the satellite was
operating well as it followed a course that carries it over <PERCENT>80
percent</PERCENT> of the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>.
   They also reported that <LOCATION>Atlantis</LOCATION> was expected to return to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>
<DATE>Tuesday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME>, landing at <ORGANIZATION>Edwards Air Force Base</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>.
The <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION> has said it would
provide 24 hours advance notice of a landing time.
   As word about the satellite was reported, Atlantis' five
astronauts were beginning the fourth day of their mission and <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>
and the <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> were keeping a tight lid on information about
their activities.
   Before today, there had been no in-flight information leaked to
news agencies as it was on two earlier <ORGANIZATION>Defense Department</ORGANIZATION> shuttle
missions.
   ``It seems the <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> have learned how to plug the
leaks,'' said one official <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, on condition he not be named.
   Sources had said before <DATE>Friday</DATE>'s launch from <LOCATION>Cape Canaveral</LOCATION> that
the flight would end <DATE>today</DATE> or <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> unless the crew needed more
time to deploy the radar satellite or to conduct other
military-oriented experiments.
   At <ORGANIZATION>Edwards</ORGANIZATION>, a ground crew <DATE>Sunday</DATE> conducted a simulated shuttle
landing, an exercise normally done a day or two before a mission
ends. But there was no announcement of a landing.
   Plans for the next shuttle flight, set for <DATE>Feb. 18</DATE>, received a
setback last week when part of a rocket for boosting a
communications satellite into orbit from the shuttle was badly
damaged.
   A worker bumped into the nozzle on the rocket's first stage and
cracked it during during pre-launch checks <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, and the entire
first stage will be replaced, said <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>George Diller</PERSON>.
   Testing was to have begun <DATE>Dec. 10</DATE> on the combined first and
second stages of the two-stage booster, he said. The tests will be
delayed until about <DATE>Dec. 27</DATE>, he said, and technicians probably would
have to work two shifts a day seven days a week to maintain the
launch schedule for the Discovery's mission, he said.
   The satellite deployed by the Atlantis' crew reportedly is to
serve someday as the ``radar eye'' for the new B-2 stealth bomber,
selecting potential targets. That would eliminate the need for the
aircraft to use its own radar, which might disclose its location.
   The astronauts also reportedly were to conduct several
experiments aimed at defining man's role as an observer in space,
with emphasis on reconnaissance. It was believed they were to test a
new optical device that resembles binoculars.
   <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> Cmdr. <PERSON>Robert L. Gibson</PERSON> commands the flight. The other crew
members are Col. <PERSON>Richard M. Mullane</PERSON>, Lt. Col. <PERSON>Guy S. Gardner</PERSON> and Lt.
Col. <PERSON>Jerry L. Ross</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> Cmdr. <PERSON>William M.
Shepherd</PERSON>.
   The mission is the 27th in the shuttle program, the third
dedicated solely to the military and the <DATE>second since the 1986</DATE>
Challenger explosion that killed seven astronauts and halted flights
for 32 months.

<TEXT>
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> rolled out a full-scale model of
its next generation space shuttle for public viewing <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, with
hopes it will impress those holding the purse strings for the
nation's space program.
   The 115-foot mockup of the planned Shuttle-C, an unmanned,
cargo-carrying space shuttle, was put together in a hanger at
<ORGANIZATION>Marshall Space Flight Center</ORGANIZATION> for about <MONEY>$500,000</MONEY>.
   The model will be shown to visiting congressman and other VIPs,
and is expected to become part of bus tours through <PERSON>Marshall</PERSON>
operated by the <ORGANIZATION>Alabama Space and Rocket Center</ORGANIZATION>.
   It might also travel to <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Kennedy Space Center</ORGANIZATION> so
technicians can practice handling future space shuttle vehicles.
   ``It's more than just something to look at; it's a design tool
that our engineers will use in deciding how systems they're working
on will fit in full scale and how they would be used and ultimately
how we would handle something like Shuttle-C,'' said <PERSON>Larry Russell</PERSON>,
a <ORGANIZATION>Marshall</ORGANIZATION> engineer.
   The <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION> hopes to get
the first funds for a <MONEY>$1.5 billion</MONEY> Shuttle-C development program in
its fiscal <DATE>1991</DATE> budget, with the program managed through <PERSON>Marshall</PERSON>.
   The center is responsible for development and management of the
space shuttle fleet's main engines, booster rockets and external
fuel tanks.
   As proposed by <PERSON>Marshall</PERSON> engineers, Shuttle-C would be a wingless
version of the existing space shuttles, using the same propulsion
systems, two shuttle main engines, external fuel tank and two solid
fuel booster rockets.
   Shuttle-C would weigh about 75,000 pounds empty, less than half
the weight of the 174,000-pound manned orbiters. It could carry
payloads in its 16-by-82-foot cargo bay as heavy as 145,000 pounds,
three times the weight current shuttles can lift.
   Unlike its manned counterparts, however, Shuttle-C could not be
reused and would be discarded like old booster rockets.
   ``We need a heavy lift vehicle to get major pieces of the space
station into orbit, and we think Shuttle-C is what we need,'' said
<PERSON>J.R. Thompson</PERSON>, <PERSON>Marshall</PERSON> director and deputy <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>
administrator-designate.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> could fly a working version of Shuttle-C by <DATE>1994</DATE> if
congressional funding begins next year, <PERSON>Russell</PERSON> said.

The children chose bold names for their airplanes: Supersonic Spyplane, 391 
Speedbird and Jetski III. Although these planes were made of flimsy white 
paper, their young pilots took them as seriously as the shuttles they hope to 
ride into outer space someday. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to be an astronaut," said <PERSON>Jesus Sanchez</PERSON>, 8. "I want to explore." 
</P>
<P>
Sanchez and about 14 other members of the Young Astronaut Program flew the 
paper planes in a contest <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> in the yard of the <ORGANIZATION>E.P. Foster Elementary 
School</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Ventura</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The nationwide program for elementary and junior high school students promotes 
science, mathematics and space-related subjects. The effort is intended to help 
reverse the low proficiency levels of American students in these subjects, 
compared with children in other industrialized countries. 
</P>
<P>
The students' creations were judged by the school's principal and two reading 
specialists on the planes' distance, speed and fancy acrobatics. Using scissors 
and thin white paper, the students designed the planes, adding ridges and folds 
that enabled the aircraft to dip and glide in strange patterns. Paper clips 
mounted to the folds increased the planes' speed. 
</P>
<P>
Sanchez's F-14 Tomcat, an intricately folded plane, earned him the title of 
overall winner and first place in the distance category and second place in 
acrobatics. 
</P>
<P>
Sanchez's peers also expressed an avid interest in aviation. <PERSON>Mario Pena</PERSON>, who 
placed third in distance, said he too wanted to go into space. "I'd like to see 
the planets," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Winning planes flew 20 to 30 feet, and some remained in the air for more than 
two minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Teacher <PERSON>Catharine Byl</PERSON> began a chapter of the <ORGANIZATION>Young Astronauts Program</ORGANIZATION> at the 
school in <DATE>February</DATE> and has helped about 20 second- and third-grade students 
build model space shuttles, understand gravity and weightlessness and 
experiment with team-related projects. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a real need for kids today to improve in those areas," she said, 
adding that aerospace and aviation will be among the major fields in the future 
as the technological revolution continues.

<HEAD>Many Differences Between U.S. And Soviet Space Shuttles</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HOWARD BENEDICT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Aerospace Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> space shuttle was never
equipped for an unmanned test flight like the one planned tonight
for the Soviets' look-alike orbiter. At the time, the program was
behind schedule, money was tight and the technology was not well
developed.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>, however, says it had confidence that its design would work
the first time when the shuttle <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION> made its debut more than
seven years ago.
   Despite the striking resemblance of the two spacecraft, there are
numerous other differences between them.
   The Soviet shuttle's main engines will be on the Energia rocket
instead of on the reusable orbiter. The craft has small jet engines
that give it greater maneuverability for landing. And it has
liquid-fuel booster rockets instead of solid-fuel boosters like the
one that destroyed Challenger in <DATE>January 1986</DATE>, grounding the
American program for 32 months.
   The <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> announced <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> that its shuttle would be
launched at <TIME>11:23 p.m. EDT</TIME> <DATE>today</DATE>, or <TIME>6:23 a.m.</TIME> <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> time <DATE>Saturday</DATE>.
The shuttle is named Buran, Russian for snowstorm.
   Soviet officials said Buran's first flight would be pilotless to
avoid deaths in case of an accident like the Challenger explosion.
   The <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION> said its
decision to have two astronauts pilot the first <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> shuttle
reflected engineers' confidence that it would work the first time,
but only if humans were aboard.
   Spacecraft in the earlier <ORGANIZATION>Mercury</ORGANIZATION>, Gemini and Apollo programs
underwent extensive unmanned testing before men flew them.
   But the shuttle program was running three years behind schedule
and financial pressure on <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> was rising.
   Flying the shuttle without astronauts would have required
extensive and expensive changes to allow the automatic pilot to
respond to radio commands.
   Officials also noted that the American shuttle was built with the
technology of the early <DATE>1970s</DATE>, when it would have been more
difficult to develop an automated landing system for so complex a
craft. The Soviets, coming along a decade later, could take
advantage of the latest developments.
   As a precaution, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> shuttle included ejection seats for the
two pilots who flew early shakedown missions. But there was room for
only two such devices, and they were removed when crews expanded.
   The Soviet shuttle will be boosted into orbit by the new Energia
rocket, which can lift a 220,000-pound payload. That rivals the
power of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s huge <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> 5 rocket, which was scrapped for
economy reasons after taking six Apollo crews to the moon.
   The liquid-hydrogen, liquid-oxygen booster has had only one test
flight, in <DATE>May 1987</DATE>. The Soviets called the test a success, even
though the payload failed to reach orbit. Several other technical
problems cropped up during the flight, and engineers worked for
months to correct them.
   The Soviet shuttle's main engines are attached to the <LOCATION>Energia</LOCATION>,
meaning they will be jettisoned and cannot be reused. On the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
shuttle, the main motors are part of the orbiter and can be reflown
up to 55 times.
   By not carrying its engines, the Soviet shuttle can haul more
cargo than its <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> cousin, about 66,000 pounds compared with 55,000
pounds. The disadvantage is that new, expensive powerplants have to
be built for each launch.
   Assisting the Soviet craft into space are four strap-on rockets,
also powered by liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen. The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> vehicle
has two solid-fuel strap-on motors.
   After descending from orbit, the American shuttle becomes a
powerless glider. If it were unable to reach its runway, or if high
crosswinds or something else spoiled its final approach, the crew
would have to bail out and leave the vehicle to crash.
   The Soviet craft's two small jet engines would enable it to make
its final approach at a safer, shallower angle and allow greater
maneuverability, including the possibility of a second landing
attempt.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> considered using jet engines for landing, but abandoned the
idea because of cost, weight and technical tradeoffs.

   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> rejected a bidder on the <ORGANIZATION>Hubble Space
Telescope</ORGANIZATION> that planned tests to detect focusing flaws and instead
picked a company that proposed no such tests and made mirrors with
a fuzzy view of the universe, a space agency official says.
   <ORGANIZATION>Eastman Kodak Co.</ORGANIZATION>, in its effort to win the contract to build
the Hubble mirrors, proposed a ``final assembly testing'' of the
telescope optics, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> Deputy Administrator <PERSON>James R. Thompson</PERSON> told
a <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> panel <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>, however, gave the contract to <ORGANIZATION>Perkin-Elmer Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, now
<ORGANIZATION>Hughes Danbury Optical Systems Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, which did not plan the fully
assembled tests, and the agency chose not to order the tests
because they were so expensive, <PERSON>Thompson</PERSON> said.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Hubble Telescope</ORGANIZATION>, now in orbit, is disabled because of a
focusing flaw that might have been found by tests proposed in the
<ORGANIZATION>Kodak</ORGANIZATION> bid.
   ``In retrospect, perhaps an all-systems test could have been
done or should have been done,'' <PERSON>Thompson</PERSON> told the science and
space subcommittee.
   Officials of the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION>
declined to say why <ORGANIZATION>Perkin-Elmer</ORGANIZATION> was selected for the Hubble
contract, but <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>Bill Sheehan</PERSON> said ``Perkin-Elmer had,
on balance, more strength.''
   <ORGANIZATION>Perkin-Elmer</ORGANIZATION>'s experience in building spy satellites may have
been a factor, other sources said.
   The <LOCATION>Danbury</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Conn.</LOCATION>, firm's winning bid in <DATE>1977</DATE> was for <MONEY>$63.4
million</MONEY>, but the total value of the contract swelled through cost
overruns and changes to <MONEY>$451 million</MONEY>. Almost <MONEY>$20 million</MONEY> of that
was paid by <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> as award fees, which are given based on
performance evaluation.
   <PERSON>Stephen Beale</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> procurement officer, said an additional
<MONEY>$4.3 million</MONEY> in award fees for the company are under consideration.
   <PERSON>Sen. Albert Gore</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-Tenn.</LOCATION>, who chaired the hearing, charged that
<ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s recent problems with a crippled telescope and a space
shuttle fleet grounded by hydrogen leaks may be related to an
agency ``mindset to reject any pessimistic news.''
   Gore said <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> was ``no longer going to be satisfied'' with
what he called ``<ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s proclivity to shoot the messenger and not
give credence to troublesome studies.''
   He said the agency, for instance, rejected some studies
predicting that within the next decade there could be another
accident like the Challenge explosion that killed seven astronauts
in <DATE>1986</DATE>.
   Thompson, in a heated exchange, called the charge unfair.
   He said <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> recognized that there are risks in space flight and
that another space shuttle could be lost eventually.
   ``If you fly 100 times and I tell you that we're not going to
lose another one, that wouldn't pass the sanity test,'' said
<PERSON>Thompson</PERSON>. ``If we fly 100 more, we may lose another one.''
   But he added: ``I think the chance is very, very low with the
team we have in place.''
   Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION>Hubble Space Telescope</ORGANIZATION> experts told a news conference
that they have moved closer to determining which of two mirrors on
the observatory spacecraft had been cut to the wrong prescription.
   ``All of the evidence is beginning to point toward the primary
mirror and not the secondary mirror,'' said <PERSON>Ed Weiler</PERSON>, chief
project scientist for the Hubble.
   The telescope has two mirrors, a 94-inch primary and a 12-inch
secondary, that are suspects in the focusing flaw that has
handicapped Hubble. Experts are working to determine which mirror
is flawed. This will help make corrective optics for a replacement
camera that will be installed by <DATE>1993</DATE>.
   If the primary mirror is at fault, <PERSON>Weiler</PERSON> said, it will be
easier to correct than if the problem was in the secondary mirror.
The secondary mirror reflects light from the primary mirror into
the telescope's instruments.

<FP=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent <PERSON>Semen Ivanov</PERSON>] </F>
  [Text] <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> <DATE>January 17</DATE> TASS -- The launch of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> 
"Discovery" space shuttle on which a Russian cosmonaut is to 
make the first flight was postponed from <DATE>January 20</DATE> to <DATE>February 
3</DATE> because of malfunctions in the craft's engines, TASS learned 
from reliable sources in the Russian space business on <DATE>Monday</DATE>. 
  35 year-old <PERSON>Sergey Krikalyov</PERSON> is the first Russian cosmonaut 
to fly on board the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> space shuttle, according to a 
U.S.-Russian agreement. 
  Krikalyov made two space flights on the Russian "Mir" space 
station, the first lasted for 151 days in <DATE>1988-1989</DATE> and the 
second - <DATE>312 days from May 1991</DATE> to <DATE>March 1992</DATE>. 
  Krikalyov who was trained for the shuttle flight in the 
<LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> said the Russian training programme is better in 
many aspects. 
  <PERSON>Krikalyov</PERSON>, who is a computer engineer, said the computers 
installed on the "Discovery" had been designed long ago and are 
considerably inferior to the computer centre onboard the "Mir". 
  He also complained about an inconvenient work schedule in 
orbit - in two shifts. There is only one sleeping-bag for two 
crew members and they have to sleep in turn, according to him. 
  <PERSON>Krikalyov</PERSON> was surprised that after the training programme 
was 
completed astronauts did not have to pass any exams or tests. 
It is the captain who bears all responsibility for the flight 
preparations. 
  This is the second delay in the launch of the space shuttle. 
Initially it was planned for <DATE>last November 10</DATE>, but was also

<HL> Space Shuttle Has New Flaw; Test Is Aborted --- Valve Fails to Close Properly Or Is Misread by Sensor; Week's Delay Is Possible </HL>

   The ill-starred space shuttle program suffered yet another embarrassment. 

   A moment before the space shuttle Discovery's three main engines were set to fire in a crucial test yesterday, an electronic engine controller automatically aborted the test. 
The controller sensed that engine No. 2 -- a new engine that had never flown in space -- hadn't closed a critical valve fast enough and might leak pressurized fuel. 
At worst, such a leak could rupture the engine. 

   Scrubbing the test is the latest in a series of setbacks that have pushed the launching of Discovery far behind schedule. 
This <DATE>spring</DATE> the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION> confidently predicted an <DATE>August</DATE> liftoff, and the agency still contends it can make it in <DATE>September</DATE>. 
But now even <DATE>October</DATE> seems optimistic. 
<ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> has said it won't set a date until after it successfully completes the test firing. 

   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> first must figure out whether the shuttle engine actually malfunctioned or a sensor merely misread the situation. 
The agency suspended the test until <DATE>Sunday</DATE> but said the delay could stretch until late next week depending on the severity of the problem. 

   Boyce Mix, resident manager of <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Stennis Test Center</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Bay St. Louis</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Miss.</LOCATION>, where the engines are tested, said <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> hopes to decide today how to repair the problem. 
The critical valve, an engine leak-valve, must be at least <PERCENT>80%</PERCENT> closed before firing, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> officials said, but in the test yesterday, according to the electronic controller, it had closed only <PERCENT>76%</PERCENT>. 

   <PERSON>Joseph Lombardo</PERSON>, project manager for the shuttle engines, said that <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> will remove the valve and sensor assembly if they are found faulty. 
That would take about a week. 
Alternatively, he said, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> might decide to change the software controlling the valve. 
That would take just a few days. 

   Engine problems can sometimes lead to big delays. 
During <DATE>1984</DATE>, for instance, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> delayed the maiden launch of Discovery for two months when it discovered an engine problem one second after the engines ignited. 
<ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> closed down the launch and later pulled the shuttle back to the assembly building, where workers replaced an engine. 

   Neither of the changes contemplated by <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> would require the shuttle to be rolled off the launching pad. 
But <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> faces additional delays because of a small fuel-line leak in a steering rocket. 
<ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> wants to repair the leak on the launching pad by cutting into the shuttle and clamping the leak. 
But it hasn't attempted such a repair on the pad before. 

   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> had hoped to make yesterday's test firing a kind of confirmation party for the shuttle. 
The space agency rolled the Discovery out of its hangar on <DATE>July 4</DATE>, a stirring sight that television news shows used as an optimistic counterpoint to stories about the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Navy</ORGANIZATION> downing an Iranian passenger plane. 
A successful test firing, which evaluates how spacecraft equipment performs under launch stress, would have demonstrated <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s renewed technical prowess. 

   About 50 reporters showed up to observe the <TIME>7:30 a.m.</TIME> firing from a grandstand three miles from the launching pad. 
<ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> set up a souvenir stand nearby, and <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> workers watched the countdown from the roof of the flight control center, about a quarter-mile away. 

   The countdown started flawlessly. 
The escape walkway that astronauts use in case of disaster pulled back at seven minutes before ignition; the on-board computers switched on at 30 seconds before firing. 
But then, at five seconds before launch, just when the main engines were to begin firing, the countdown shut down, the escape hatch jumped back into position, and <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>, once more, had to figure out what had gone wrong with the shuttle. 

   No <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> astronauts have been lofted since <DATE>Jan. 28, 1986</DATE>, when the shuttle Challenger exploded after liftoff and its seven crewmembers were killed.

   Discovery moved into the glare of
spotlights early <DATE>Monday</DATE> on its long-awaited trip to the launch pad
and a giant step toward <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s first space shuttle flight since
the Challenger tragedy.
   A flag-waving Fourth of <DATE>July</DATE> crowd of several hundred space
workers cheered as the 85-ton spaceship edged out of an assembly
building at <TIME>12:50 a.m.</TIME>, riding upright on the broad back of a giant
tracked transporter called a crawler.
   The 4.2-mile journey to Launch Pad 39B was scheduled to take six
to seven hours. Attached to Discovery were a 154-foot-tall external
fuel tank and the two 149-foot solid fuel booster rockets that will
hurl the craft into space on a flight scheduled for early <DATE>September</DATE>.
   As the rollout began, <ORGANIZATION>Kennedy Space Center</ORGANIZATION> director <PERSON>Forrest S.
McCartney</PERSON> presented astronaut <PERSON>Dave Hilmers</PERSON>, one of Discovery's five
assigned crew members, with an autograph book containing the names
of 15,240 engineers, technicians, managers, secretaries, clerical
workers and other center employees who have labored to return the
shuttle fleet to flight.
   The astronauts will carry the book into orbit with them.
   McCartney, <PERSON>Hilmers</PERSON> and other <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> officials watched the rollout
from a flag-bedecked grandstand outside the assembly building.
   The early morning move was planned to avoid thunderstorms and
lighting which are common during the day this time of the year.
   Center officials originally said all five of <ORGANIZATION>Discovery</ORGANIZATION>'s
astronauts and <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> administrator <PERSON>James C. Fletcher</PERSON> would be here
for the rollout. But four of the crew members elected to spend the
holiday weekend with their families in <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION>, and <PERSON>Fletcher</PERSON>'s
office said <DATE>Friday</DATE> he couldn't make it.
   The failure of a seal in a booster rocket joint doomed
Challenger 73 seconds after it lifted off on <DATE>Jan. 28, 1986</DATE>. All
seven crew members perished in the massive explosion.
   Since then the booster has been significantly redesigned and
tested and hundreds of other modifications have been made to the
shuttle main engines and other systems.
   Once at the pad, Discovery will be readied for a critical <DATE>July
24</DATE> test of modifications to the three main liquid-fuel engines.
With the spaceship bolted firmly to its launch mounts, the power
plant will be ignited for 19.4 seconds at the end of a practice
countdown.
   The following day, one final pre-flight test-firing of a
redesigned booster rocket is planned at the <ORGANIZATION>Morton Thiokol</ORGANIZATION> plant in
<LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION>. Both tests must be passed before Discovery is certified for
flight.
   On <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, a test of an intentionally damaged version of the
shuttle rocket's redesigned joint was apparently successful, <ORGANIZATION>Morton
Thiokol</ORGANIZATION> said. The test was conducted at a plant near <LOCATION>Brigham City</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION>.
   ``It appears no gas leaked outside the joint, in spite of the
very severe intentional flaws,'' said <ORGANIZATION>Thiokol</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>Rocky Raab</PERSON>.
``That has really raised our confidence for the (full-scale) test
at the end of the month.''
   The <TIME>1 p.m.</TIME> MDT test was performed on a simulator that uses three
shortened rocket cases, two joints and 385 pounds of propellant to
mimic pressures present during when a full-scale rocket motor is
fired.
   Last week, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> announced that it had changed the liftoff date
from <DATE>late August</DATE> to early <DATE>September</DATE> because it was taking longer
than expected to prepare Discovery for flight.
   <PERSON>Hilmers</PERSON> and four other veteran shuttle pilots will be at the
controls when Discovery blasts off to mark what <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> is counting on
to revive <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s manned space program. The others are Commander
<PERSON>Rick Hauck</PERSON>, <PERSON>Dick Covey</PERSON>, <PERSON>Mike Lounge</PERSON> and <PERSON>George Nelson</PERSON>.
   During their four-day mission, the astronauts will deploy a
communications satellite, conduct scientific and technical
experiments and check out changes made to the orbiter systems.

<HEAD>Small Fuel Leak Fixed In Space Shuttle</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: LEADS with 2 grafs to UPDATE with leak fixed, Picks up 4th graf,
`Discovery's target ...'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Engineers have fixed a leak
discovered in a hydrogen fuel line on space shuttle Discovery, which
is being prepared for a late <DATE>February</DATE> launch.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> said the leak, detected <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, was caused by a fuel line
misalignment that was quickly corrected once the source was known.
It was in a 2-inch line in a section that connects the shuttle to
its external fuel tank.
   Discovery's target launch date is <DATE>Feb. 23</DATE>, but preparations have
been running slightly behind schedule and officials said <DATE>earlier
this week</DATE> they expected a delay of at least two days.
   The delay could be longer if engineers don't learn why a part
cracked in a main engine during Atlantis' liftoff in <DATE>December</DATE>. They
believe two tiny cracks found in a turbopump during post-flight
inspection were caused by stress corrosion, apparently resulting
from moisture that somehow penetrated the metal.
   Until they discover the source of the moisture, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> will not
clear Discovery for flight. Officials have expressed confidence the
problem will be resolved in time to meet a <DATE>February</DATE> launch date.
   If it isn't, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> is considering other options, including
postponing the Discovery flight until after an Atlantis mission set
for liftoff in <DATE>April</DATE>.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> has said that if Discovery can't get off the only launch pad
available by <DATE>March 14</DATE>, it would postpone that mission until after
the Atlantis launch because the Atlantis crew has only a 25-day
period starting <DATE>April 28</DATE> during which it can deploy the <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>
payload to probe the planet <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> has priority over <ORGANIZATION>Discovery</ORGANIZATION>'s communications satellite
because <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> will not be in position again to receive a visitor
from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> until <DATE>May 1991</DATE>.
   Meanwhile, in <LOCATION>Huntsville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ala.</LOCATION>, a space shuttle engine firing
test scheduled at <ORGANIZATION>Marshall Space Flight Center</ORGANIZATION> was delayed after a
problem was found in the engine control box, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> officials said.
   The problem was discovered late <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> as workers completed
last-minute checks, said <PERSON>Len Worlund</PERSON>, deputy director of the
center's propulsion laboratory.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>Jim Sahli</PERSON> said <DATE>today</DATE> that the shuttle flight
schedule would not be affected by the delay since the engine is in
the developmental stages.
   The 45-second firing, which was scheduled for <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME>,
was to be the last of three preliminary tests before engineers begin
a program to explore new engine technology. The test has been
postponed until next week.
   The engine control box, or controller, regulates all valves in
the engine and monitors temperature, pressure and other conditions.

With Buddhist blessings and bittersweet memories, a 27-foot-long replica of the 
space shuttle Challenger was unveiled in <LOCATION>Little Tokyo</LOCATION> on <DATE>Friday</DATE> in honor of 
Col. <PERSON>Ellison Onizuka</PERSON>, one of seven crew members who died in the shuttle 
explosion more than four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
One-tenth the size of the Challenger, the memorial stands in the middle of a 
plaza named after <PERSON>Onizuka</PERSON>, the first Asian-American in space. 
</P>
<P>
"With this project now fixed to the street that bears his name, all of you have 
given my husband, <PERSON>Ellison Onizuka</PERSON>, a very proud sense of permanence here in the 
<LOCATION>City</LOCATION> of Angels," said his widow, <PERSON>Lorna</PERSON>, before she pulled a cord unveiling the 
fiberglass model with the help of <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON>Tom Bradley</PERSON> and several 
astronauts from the American and Japanese space programs. 
</P>
<P>
"Thank you for remembering with me and my children and my family a man who 
gently touched our lives in very special ways and then went away," said 
<PERSON>Onizuka</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
So true in detail is the monument that astronaut Col. <PERSON>Loren Shriver</PERSON> quipped 
that "if we have too many more problems with (the space shuttle) <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION> and 
hydrogen leaks, we may come and ask the committee if we can borrow this shuttle 
and use it for a while." 
</P>
<P>
Money for the <MONEY>$250,000</MONEY> memorial is being raised by the local Japanese-American 
community. The replica sits atop a black granite base with a bronze plaque, 
bearing a large relief bust of Onizuka, and an inscription in English and 
Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
"Born and raised in a simple rural community, he walked a remarkable path that 
led from the coffee fields of <LOCATION>Kona</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>, to miles above the earth," reads 
part of the inscription. 
</P>
<P>
The ill-fated Challenger launch was the second space flight for the 39-year-old 
Onizuka. Less than two minutes after liftoff on <DATE>Jan. 28, 1986</DATE>, the Challenger 
exploded, killing all seven aboard.
