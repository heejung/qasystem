<DESCRIPT>  MUSIC; CELEBRITY; MAN; QA; PROFILE; INTERVIEW  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  AT FIRST, he was just Herbert Khaury from Queens, a middle-aged man with long
hair and a photographic memory for the styles of ancient crooners.;   But then
he became Tiny Tim, playing smoky Greenwich Village clubs and winning a campy
cult. And finally, in the late '60s, he became a star.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  TINY TIM: STILL ON HIS TIPTOES  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  SAY ANYTHING  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     He had a hit album, "God Bless Tiny Tim." He played <LOCATION>Las Vegas</LOCATION> for a
reported <MONEY>$50,000</MONEY> a week. He married <PERSON>Miss Vicki</PERSON> on the <PERSON>Johnny Carson</PERSON> show.;  
Those days are gone. But Tiny <PERSON>Tim</PERSON>, 61 -- or is it 68? The reference books
disagree -- still tours. He still plays the ukulele and does pitch-perfect
impressions of <PERSON>Bing Crosby</PERSON> and <PERSON>Rudy Vallee</PERSON>. He's been in a Diet <ORGANIZATION>Pepsi</ORGANIZATION>
commercial and played a killer clown in a barely seen horror movie called
"Blood Harvest." He's still in show business.;   In a way, <ORGANIZATION>Tiny Tim</ORGANIZATION> is show
business. And every interview is a performance.; Q: I know you're a very
formal person. Should I call you Tiny Tim? Mr. Tiny? <PERSON>Mr. Tim</PERSON>?;   A: Oh Tiny's
all right. Tim is all right. It's all OK.;   Q: Well, what sort of songs do
you do in concert these days, Tiny?;   A: What I've done for years. Little
tidbits like "Grand Old Flag," "I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy," "He's Got the
Whole World in His Hands" -- songs everyone knows. And in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, if I
don't forget, (sings) "<LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, open your golden gate, you'll find no
strangers there, beside your door.";   Q: And "Tiptoe Through the Tulips"?;  
A: Every show, every time.;   Q: What made that such a big hit for you?;   A:
Originality is the key to success in any business. And that song had an
original sound. It was good enough to make them wonder "What's that?";   Q: A
while ago you were also doing some country and western songs. Are you still
pursuing that?;   A: Oh, whatever's popular I pursue. That's a good memory,
<PERSON>Mr. Whitty</PERSON>. That was back in <DATE>'88</DATE>. Yes, as a matter of fact. I had an album
that was supposed to come out. But the guy's check bounced. But there was a
single from that album released called "Leave Me Satisfied." And people loved
it until they found out it was <ORGANIZATION>Tiny Tim</ORGANIZATION>. (Sings with a drawl) "Someone else is
on your mind, it's plain to see / And you believe you love him more than me."
People said "That can't be Tiny Tim!";   Q: Sort of a different sound for
you.;   A: You ain't kidding.;   Q: So you think the name scared country fans
off a bit?;   A: Yes. The strange name and the appearance. You know, I've lost
more women with the way I look than the way I sound! Nothing I can do about it
though. . . . Originality brings success but what can I tell you. My second
wife is leaving <LOCATION>me.</LOCATION>;   Q: Really?;   A: She's going to her lawyer.;   Q: When
you married your first wife it was one of the highest-rated TV programs ever.
Do you ever see Miss <PERSON>Vicki</PERSON>? Or your daughter, <ORGANIZATION>Tulip</ORGANIZATION>?;   A: Tulip I take care
of every month. She gets about <MONEY>$320</MONEY>. She's working for the <ORGANIZATION>Teamsters</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION>. She has a daughter . . . Miss <PERSON>Vicki</PERSON> has married a third time. I
don't see her or talk to her. There's no reason to talk to the past. There's
an old song in the '20s by <PERSON>Johnny Marvin</PERSON>: "After I've called you sweetheart,
how can I call you friend?" The same way it'll be with this one if she leaves.
But from what I hear <PERSON>Miss Vicki</PERSON> is the manager of a luggage shop in <LOCATION>Cherry
Hill</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>;   Q: So it looks like you're going to be available again.;   A:
Well, I don't know to who! Although Miss Jan hasn't gotten her divorce yet. .
. . But what can I tell you. I'm in love with a woman who doesn't love me.
She's 24 years old, she's in <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, but she's a perfect woman, at least in my
mind. I fantasize about her every day.;   Q: Let's go back to music. What do
you think of rap? Any interest in a Tiny Tim rap song?;   A: Sure. I tell you,
whatever's popular in music, whether it's <DATE>1991</DATE> or 1891 it's the trend of
youth. Youth always brings their own music . . . Back in <DATE>1927</DATE>, <DATE>1925</DATE> there was
a song (sings) "Collegiate, collegiate, yes we are collegiate" -- that was a
new trend. Led into the flapper-dapper era. And parents were saying, "What's
happened to our youth?" Youth always brings its own music. And today it's rap,
and heavy metal, which I love.;   Q: Any favorite heavy metal bands?;   A: I
love Guns N' Roses. I have one of their cassettes floating around. I just
bought <ORGANIZATION>Metallica</ORGANIZATION> last week. I really like what's happening today. I even have
a heavy metal record.;   Q: You mean you recorded a heavy metal record?;   A:
Oh yes, with <ORGANIZATION>His Majesty</ORGANIZATION>'s Orchestra, a heavy metal band in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>. I
recorded it in <DATE>1983</DATE>. (Sings) "I'm on the highway to hell . . ." It's yet to be
released here. It sold 80 copies in <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION> a couple of years ago and then it
dropped to zero. But that was 80 copies more than I'd sold in the <DATE>last 10
years.</DATE>;   Q: Do you have a favorite singer?;   A: There were some who were
outstanding. Of course <PERSON>Rudy Vallee</PERSON>, who I thought was a great romantic singer.
My favorite singer of about <DATE>1900</DATE> was <PERSON>Byron G. Harlan</PERSON>, who in my opinion was
the first popular singer of the American phonograph . . . And just a snip of
how he sounded (sings and plays the ukulele), "School days, school days, dear
old Golden Rule days . . ." Just love that sound. And the early <PERSON>Bing Crosby</PERSON>,
from '28 just to <DATE>'35</DATE>. I don't think there ever was a greater popular singer
than the young <PERSON>Mr. Crosby</PERSON> . . . (sings and plays the ukulele) "Lend your
little ear to my plea, lend a little cheer to my plea . . ." I love that early
Bing sound. And <PERSON>Harry Richman</PERSON> . . . (sings, again) "Gee but it's great,
staying out late, walking my baby back ho-o-o-ome." He knocked them dead.;  
Q: <PERSON>Rudy Vallee</PERSON> and <PERSON>Bing Crosby</PERSON> were both performing into their 70s and beyond.
Can you see yourself still doing this then?;   A: If I'm alive and well and
able to get on stage. But I tell you, when I do my own shows -- all these
artists, <PERSON>Wayne Newton</PERSON>, <PERSON>Frank Sinatra</PERSON> who do hour shows -- I only like to do
about 20 minutes. In the old days of vaudeville, that's all they did.;   Q:
Always leave 'em wanting more?;   A: Oh yes. My theory is hit 'em with a
couple of great songs, make them remember you and leave while you're ahead.
Hit 'em with "Grand Old Flag" and go out with "Tiptoe Through the Tulips" and
they'll say, "Well -- he wasn't as bad as we thought."; Tiny <PERSON>Tim; Dr.
Demento</PERSON>'s 20th Anniversary Celebration, with <PERSON>Bobby</PERSON> "Boris" <PERSON>Pickett</PERSON>, <PERSON>Eddie</PERSON> "The
Old Philosopher" <PERSON>Lawrence</PERSON> and "Weird Al" <PERSON>Yankovic</PERSON>; When: <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, <TIME>8 p.m.</TIME> and
<TIME>11 p.m.</TIME>; Where: <ORGANIZATION>Warfield Theater</ORGANIZATION>, 982 Market St., <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>; Tickets: <MONEY>$19</MONEY>

   Taking ukuleles to <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>
sounds about as misplaced as shipping coals to <ORGANIZATION>Newcastle</ORGANIZATION>.
   But that's what 25 Vancouver-area students, aged 9 to 19, are
doing this week.
   ``Even though the ukulele is the key instrument in their society
_ it's as Hawaiian as the grass skirt _ the school authorities over
there want to learn the Canadian teaching methods we use which are
so successful,'' said <PERSON>Peter Luongo</PERSON>, vice principal and music
specialist at <PERSON>Alice Brown</PERSON> elementary.
   The school has become so skilled at teaching the four-stringed,
guitarlike instrument that word has reached <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>.
   The ukulele, introduced from <LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION> into the <LOCATION>Hawaiian Islands</LOCATION>
about <DATE>1879</DATE>, was first used in Canadian schools in the Maritime
provinces about 20 years ago to teach music, he said.
   ``It came to <LOCATION>Langley</LOCATION> about 15 years ago and we got some really
keen kids,'' he said. ``I picked up the program when I came here
and developed a senior honors group.''
   The students have played in concerts across <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> and will pay
for most of the 10-day trip beginning <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   ``We will be given a lot of hospitality but we'll be going to
schools that are very meager compared to ours and I think our
students will learn a lot about the other side of <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION> _ it's not
all plush hotels,'' <PERSON>Luongo</PERSON> said.

<P>
Does much of today's rock 'n' roll make you reel? Do you find yourself tearing 
up when you hear a refrain of "Puff, the Magic Dragon?" Fear not, there is an 
antidote for what ails you. Folk music is alive in <LOCATION>Ventura County</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Although this grass-roots music enjoys a popular resurgence from time to time, 
it has always had a faithful following and folk musicians will keep on picking 
and strumming no matter what comes and goes on the hit charts. 
</P>
<P>
Folk music itself represents the creative expression of people worldwide. But 
what is typically thought of as American folk music comes from many ethnic 
influences including black gospel, Irish working and drinking songs and 
Appalachian love ballads. While the omnipresent guitar has become the symbol of 
folk music, the banjo, fiddle, mandolin, harp, autoharp and dulcimer are also 
used extensively. 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura folk scene offers plenty of opportunities for those who enjoy 
participating as well as those who don't. Hootenannies, or "Hoots" for short, 
are essentially sing-alongs and are held several times a week in the homes of 
various enthusiasts who call themselves the Songmakers. 
</P>
<P>
The group has been meeting continuously since it first got together in the '40s 
as a way for songwriters to share their material with their fellow composers. 
Their most famous member has been American folk singer <PERSON>Pete Seeger</PERSON>, member 
<PERSON>Jackie Smith</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
The Songmakers, which boasts 300 paid members, has grown to include those who 
enjoy singing and playing as well as writing folk music. On any given evening, 
20 to 30 musicians gather to listen to one anothers original compositions or 
interpretations of more traditional melodies. All instruments and levels of 
ability are welcome, both professional and amateur, said <PERSON>Smith</PERSON>, as the emphasis 
is on fun. 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura chapter meets in <LOCATION>Simi Valley</LOCATION> every <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> as well as the third 
<DATE>Friday</DATE> of each month. Call (805) 527-7340 for more information. There is no 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
Several cities in the county also offer <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> concerts for those who 
prefer to sit back rather than sing along. The oldest in the series is a 
"coffeehouse" in <LOCATION>Thousand Oaks</LOCATION>, which is held the first <DATE>Friday</DATE> of each month. 
Now in its 10th year, this event draws both local and out-of-the-area 
musicians. 
</P>
<P>
This month, <PERSON>Paul Sanchez</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Rabbit MacKay</ORGANIZATION>, two <LOCATION>Ventura County</LOCATION> residents, 
performed a combination of folk, blues, country, rock and original music. 
</P>
<P>
On <DATE>Aug. 3</DATE>, <PERSON>Mickey Bochard</PERSON>, a mother-and-daughter contemporary gospel duo are 
scheduled to perform. Call (805) 499-4355, the Arts Council of the <LOCATION>Conejo 
Valley</LOCATION>, for more information on the <DATE>August</DATE> concert. Admission is free. 
</P>
<P>
In response to the many musicians who wanted another showcase for their 
talents, <ORGANIZATION>Newbury Park</ORGANIZATION> started its own series of concerts called <ORGANIZATION>Fireside 
Offerings</ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON>Dawn Kuznkowski</PERSON>, program organizer and musician. Now, <DATE>five 
years later</DATE>, 100 folk music lovers gather in a cozy nook of the <ORGANIZATION>Borchard 
Community Center</ORGANIZATION> on the second <DATE>Friday</DATE> of each month to hear anything from 
foot-stomping bluegrass fiddles to twanging Hawaiian ukuleles. 
</P>
<P>
The center attracts everything from semiprofessional performers to amateurs, 
with the only restriction being that all performers play acoustic instruments. 
</P>
<P>
This month's offerings included a balladeer from the <LOCATION>Santa Cruz</LOCATION> area, <PERSON>Mark 
Levy</PERSON>, who performed original political satire/protest songs, followed by mother 
and daughter, <PERSON>Mary</PERSON> and <PERSON>Dana Crooks</PERSON>, who sang haunting Appalachian harmonies, 
and continuing with local musicians <PERSON>Jim St. Ours</PERSON>, <PERSON>Paul Sanchez</PERSON> and <PERSON>Glenn 
Scrivner</PERSON>, who played a variety of traditional ballads. They are also preparing 
to perform at the county fair later this <DATE>summer</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
The next concert will be <DATE>Aug. 10</DATE>. The performance, like all Fireside Offerings, 
is a surprise for the audience, said <PERSON>Kuznkowski</PERSON>, since the evening agenda isn't 
set until right before concert time. For more information, call (805) 498-3124 
or 495-5118. A <MONEY>$2</MONEY> donation is requested and refreshments are served. 
</P>
<P>
Camarillo is the latest community to catch the folk vision, and has been 
hosting a third-Friday-of-the-month "Camarillo Cafe" at the "O" Club at the 
<LOCATION>Camarillo Airport</LOCATION> for the past year. It goes from <TIME>8 p.m. to 12 a.m.</TIME>, event 
coordinator <PERSON>Jack Zigray</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
The cafe has been around for nearly a year and offers an eclectic mix of 
acoustic music, from traditional folk and blues to classical and even some rock 
'n' roll (of course, without amplifiers). 
</P>
<P>
At the <DATE>July</DATE> show, <PERSON>Harvey Taylor</PERSON> played blues and ragtime acoustic guitar, 
<PERSON>Barbara Brussels</PERSON> sang show tunes, guitarist and singer <ORGANIZATION>Elyna Le Fevre</ORGANIZATION> performed 
traditional folk songs, followed by acoustic duo <PERSON>Jerry Faigin</PERSON> and <PERSON>Linda Marie</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
For information on the <DATE>August</DATE> show, call (805) 482-1996, 482-0978 or 482-0986. 
Concerts sponsored by <ORGANIZATION>Pleasant Valley Recreation</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Park District</ORGANIZATION> are free and 
refreshments are served. 
</P>
<P>
No attempt at covering folk music in the county would be complete without 
mentioning two popular groups who perform regularly. The Old <ORGANIZATION>Time Fiddlers 
Assn.</ORGANIZATION>, a group of 30 or more, get together on the second and <DATE>fourth Sundays</DATE> of 
each month at the <ORGANIZATION>Community Center</ORGANIZATION> in Oak View to play their old favorites. 
Families bring blankets and picnics. A snack bar is also available. The event 
is free. Call (805) 486-8744 or 646-1583 for details. 
</P>
<P>
Another group is the Acousticats. Until recently, they called themselves The 
<PERSON>Phil Salazar</PERSON> Band and played predominantly bluegrass. According to <PERSON>Kim Louks</PERSON>, 
wife of the band's leader, the five-member group has had a change of style. 
They now characterize their music as "new acoustic," which is "progressive with 
traditional folk and jazz influences." 
</P>
<P>
The Acousticats will play at <ORGANIZATION>Henson's Music Festival</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Camarillo</LOCATION> on <DATE>Aug. 11</DATE>. 
Call (805) 482-6115 for details.

<TEXT>
   Among the the flowers, palms and deep-blue
waters of <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>, a widely esteemed native minister, the Rev.
<PERSON>Abraham K. Akaka</PERSON>, bears a message of the ukulele _ for islanders
and the world.
   To the state's singularly mixed culture of races, traditions and
ancestry, he advises, ``Think of yourselves as strings on a
ukulele, each different from the other strings, each preserving its
own tone, yet all necessary to make that beautiful harmony.''
   The objective, he said in a telephone interview, is unity in
diversity, of maintaining valued differences to enrich the whole,
something <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION> particularly manifests, and the world needs.
   ``The key to it is that all the strings, all the races, nations
and cultures of mankind need to be tuned to one tuner, God, whose
name is love,'' <PERSON>Akaka</PERSON> said. ``When they do that, they retain their
individuality, but in a way that accepts the other strings, in
unity and harmony.''
   Akaka, 71, pastor emeritus of <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>'s oldest church, the
<ORGANIZATION>Kawaiahao Church</ORGANIZATION> in downtown <LOCATION>Honolulu</LOCATION>, and among few clergymen of
original Hawaiian descent, strums the ukulele himself.
   He also has a special formula for diversified mutuality.
   It's a gentle revision of <PERSON>Albert Einstein</PERSON>'s famous formula,
energy equals mass times the speed of light squared, by which the
first atomic chain reaction was achieved in <DATE>1942</DATE> while <PERSON>Akaka</PERSON> was in
seminary in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>.
   For different purposes, he proposes his own formula: CM
(creative mutuality) squared equals P (prosperous peace).
   ``It holds great hope for the future of mankind,'' he said. ``If
foreign policies of all nations used the formula, if every family
used it, every corporation and government used it, it would change
the world.
   Akaka for 28 years led the 1,000-member <LOCATION>Kawaiahao</LOCATION> church, built
in the <DATE>1830s</DATE> of cream-colored coral from island reefs. It's
<LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s only church with royal pews _ for <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>'s one-time
monarchy. He retired in <DATE>1985</DATE>.
   But he keeps busy _ speaking, leading weddings and funerals,
blessing new homes, stores and other buildings. Gifts for his
services go to a foundation for native Hawaiian scholarships and to
help the needy.
   ``You cannot retire from the Lord,'' he said.
   More than a third of <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>'s million people are Christians,
Protestants and Roman Catholics, including most Caucasians and the
native minority, while nearly a third are Buddhist, the rest
Shintoists or other faiths.
   ``We do not have religious strife,'' <PERSON>Akaka</PERSON> said.
   A clergyman of the <ORGANIZATION>United Church of Christ</ORGANIZATION>, he said the
different religious groups have become ``more and more cooperative
in dealing with issues affecting the well-being of the people.''
   He called modern mass communications media ``an instrument of
God, binding people closer, life with life, nation with nation,
culture with culture, race with race, enabling them to learn about
each other and understand each other.''
   That multicultural quality characterizes <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>, where <PERCENT>24.5
percent</PERCENT> of the population is Caucasian, <PERCENT>23 percent</PERCENT> is of Japanese
ancestry, <PERCENT>20 percent</PERCENT> is Hawaiian and part-Hawaiian, <PERCENT>11 percent</PERCENT>
Filipino, and smaller numbers of Chinese, <LOCATION>Koreans</LOCATION>, Samoans and
blacks.
   Native Hawaiians such as <PERSON>Akaka</PERSON> are descended from Polynesians
who came in large canoes from legendary ``Hawaiki'' (believed to be
<LOCATION>Marquesas Island</LOCATION>) to the west as long as 2,000 years ago.
   A second wave came from <LOCATION>Tahiti</LOCATION> around <LOCATION>A.D.</LOCATION> 1000. The Hawaiians
lived in isolation from the world until a British naval officer,
Capt. <PERSON>James Cook</PERSON>, came on the lovely isles in <DATE>1778</DATE>.
   The native religion was polytheistic, with idols to many gods
and goddesses. After the monarchy developed, <PERSON>Queen Kaahumanu</PERSON> in
<DATE>1819</DATE> abolished the native religion.
   The gap soon was filled by Protestant missionaries, first sent
in <DATE>1820</DATE> by Congregationalist antecedants of <ORGANIZATION>Akaka</ORGANIZATION>'s present
denomination.
   They set up schools and churches, learned the Hawaiian language,
putting it into writing for the first time, introduced democratic
principles. Roman Catholic missionaries came in <DATE>1827</DATE>. Natives
overwhelmingly became Christians.
   <PERSON>Akaka</PERSON> said that unlike cases in which invading Western
civiliation ``overturned and sometimes destroyed native cultures,
the Hawaiian people were pretty fortunate. Large credit is due to
work of the missionaries.''
   Much of ``our culture and history was preserved and
perpetuated,'' <PERSON>Akaka</PERSON> said. `We are Americans today. We love our
country, love the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>... But like any other people, we
love our roots.''
   Noting the names of the main old gods, ``Wakea'' and ``Papa,''
mean space and place _ ``arms that embrace all humanity,'' he added:
   ``That is the meaning of <LOCATION>Aloha</LOCATION>, the name that the people chose
for our state, the <ORGANIZATION>Aloha State</ORGANIZATION>. It emphasizes love for all people.
Aloha means we love you, care for you, welcome you. It expresses
that we are a family belonging to each other.''

GEORGE BENSON RETURNS TO HIS JAZZ ROOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
<PERSON>George Benson</PERSON> is the <PERSON>Nat King Cole</PERSON> of the <DATE>1980s</DATE>. Like <PERSON>Cole</PERSON>, he earned fame as 
an instrumentalist before reaching world renown as a singer. 
</P>
<P>
Now, just as <PERSON>Cole</PERSON> did late in his career, he has made an album that reminds the 
public of his origins. "Tenderly" (<ORGANIZATION>Warner Bros.</ORGANIZATION> 25907), in which the eminent 
jazz pianist <PERSON>McCoy Tyner</PERSON> plays a major role, entered the jazz chart <DATE>Aug. 6</DATE> and 
has already leaped to the No. 1 spot. 
</P>
<P>
The guitarist, whose vocal personality made a fortune for him, plays on almost 
every track; three are strictly instrumental and the title cut is a guitar 
solo. 
</P>
<P>
"Even my pop fans like it," he said, just before leaving for a week in <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>. 
"They like the ballady things. My wife fell in love with 'This Is All I Ask.' 
But what knocked me out was that my mother's favorite was 'I Could Write a 
Book,' which is strictly a jazz thing. And my stepfather, who taught me how to 
play ukulele and then guitar, starting when I was 9, now says that his faith in 
my playing is reaffirmed! He was always very helpful but sometimes very 
critical -- told me I was playing too fast and he couldn't follow me. But when 
he heard this album he said, 'Boy, that's what I call guitar playing!' " 
</P>
<P>
Benson, who will appear at the Wiltern Theatre <DATE>Sept. 22-25</DATE>, using his regular 
sidemen and an orchestra, recalls that his collaboration with <PERSON>Tyner</PERSON> came about 
by sheer chance. "Last year, on my way to the <ORGANIZATION>Blue Note Club</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, I was 
listening to a jazz program on the radio and they played a tune from an old 
<PERSON>Johnny Hartman</PERSON> album. When they said <PERSON>McCoy Tyner</PERSON> was the pianist on it, I said 
to myself, 'He must have been a baby back then!' But he was already musically 
mature." (The album was made in <DATE>1963</DATE> with <PERSON>John Coltrane</PERSON> and <PERSON>Tyner</PERSON>, then 24, 
accompanying <PERSON>Hartman</PERSON>.) 
</P>
<P>
An idea occurred to <PERSON>Benson</PERSON>. "I realized how well McCoy plays behind vocalists, 
and of course we're both instrumentalists. I decided to get in touch with him. 
Our sons are close friends -- they're both together now. The next day, <PERSON>McCoy</PERSON>'s 
son was over at my house and I said 'Get in touch with your pop and ask him if 
he'd like to make a record with me.' His father called back from <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> and 
said he would." 
</P>
<P>
Aware that record companies, when confronted with noncommercial projects, react 
as if they have been asked to commit suicide, <PERSON>Benson</PERSON> went into a studio and 
produced the first five songs on his own. "The Japanese booked us as soon as 
word reached them that we were in the studio! Then <PERSON>George Wein</PERSON> got word of the 
record and set us up with a European tour." 
</P>
<P>
Having launched the idea, <PERSON>Benson</PERSON> got in touch his producer, <PERSON>Tommy Li Puma</PERSON>. 
"Tommy then contacted the record company and got them real excited. Even <PERSON>Mo 
Ostin</PERSON>, the chairman of the board at <ORGANIZATION>Warners</ORGANIZATION>, called and said, '<PERSON>George</PERSON>, this is 
a gutsy move, to do an album like that at this time in your career.' " 
</P>
<P>
The three-week European tour lived up to everyone's expectations. "We had a lot 
of fans who came because they'd heard my name, but many of them knew <PERSON>McCoy</PERSON>'s 
name and were curious to see what was going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
Coincidentally, <PERSON>Benson</PERSON> found himself involved in several other jazz 
partnerships. "I guest-starred with <ORGANIZATION>Dizzy Gillespie</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>. Boy, was he 
packing them in! I like working with the old-timers because that's really where 
I learned to play; in fact, when I was growing up, I always wanted to get into 
that bag. My first recorded attempts at that kind of music were for <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION>, 
which is why <PERSON>John Hammond</PERSON> liked me, I guess." (The late <PERSON>John Hammond</PERSON> recorded 
<PERSON>Benson</PERSON> in a series of strictly instrumental small group sessions in <DATE>1966-67</DATE>. 
"The <PERSON>George Benson</PERSON> Cookbook" is still available only in cassette form on 
CS9413.) 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, typically, offered <PERSON>Benson</PERSON> and <PERSON>Tyner</PERSON> the most wide-ranging chances to 
stretch out. "Over there, we had additional help from <ORGANIZATION>Freddie Hubbard</ORGANIZATION> on 
trumpet and <PERSON>Joe Henderson</PERSON> on saxophone. That exciting horn sound gave us even 
more of a jazz flavor," <PERSON>Benson</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
In <DATE>1966</DATE>, playing in the <LOCATION>Newport Jazz Festival</LOCATION>'s Guitar Workshop, <PERSON>Benson</PERSON> was 
hailed by Down Beat as "a young guitarist with roots in <PERSON>Charlie Christian</PERSON> and a 
wonderful beat." The reference to Christian, who revolutionized jazz guitar in 
his 1939-40 recordings with <PERSON>Benny Goodman</PERSON>, came to mind again last <DATE>June</DATE> when 
<PERSON>Benson</PERSON> was teamed with <PERSON>Lionel Hampton</PERSON> in a <ORGANIZATION>Carnegie Hall</ORGANIZATION> concert, "Hamp and 
<PERSON>George Salute Benny</PERSON>." "That was the greatest honor in the world," he says, 
"sitting in for <PERSON>Charlie Christian</PERSON> and bringing back the tunes he and <PERSON>Benny</PERSON> and 
Lionel played back then." (<PERSON>Benson</PERSON> played and recorded briefly with <PERSON>Goodman</PERSON> in 
the '70s.) 
</P>
<P>
Despite the wealth and worldwide acclaim his singing has brought him, <PERSON>Benson</PERSON> 
(and again the parallel with <PERSON>Nat King Cole</PERSON> is clear) still wants to retain the 
respect of the musicians and jazz fans who were his original admirers. "It's 
real nice," he says, "to do an album like this new one and have some jazz 
people say appreciate things about you." 
</P>
<P>
Benson's success seems to have mellowed him; part of the cause, or possibly the 
effect, may be his religious convictions. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been a dedicated <ORGANIZATION>Jehovah</ORGANIZATION>'s Witness for 10 years," he says, "and I studied 
the <LOCATION>Bible</LOCATION> long before that. I think I've changed my ways a little from my wild 
young days. I'm very careful in what I do; I'm no saint, but I do try to keep 
away from anything that will bring reproach on me. Religion has helped me 
escape some pitfalls -- helped me, I like to think, become a better man."

JACK SMITH: IN HAWAII, HOW GREEN IS HIS VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Smith 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In <LOCATION>Honolulu</LOCATION> the lush <LOCATION>Nuuanu Valley</LOCATION> rises through a pass in the dark green 
mountains to a precipice called the pali. It is a place where people often stop 
and park their cars to peer from a viewpoint above the stupendous cliff out 
over the velvet green coastal plain below. 
</P>
<P>
Our friend <PERSON>Harry Albright</PERSON> drove us up through the valley through vegetation so 
green and thick it made us forget for a moment the concrete excrescence that 
<LOCATION>Waikiki</LOCATION> had become. From the pali we could see the rugged windward shore of the 
island, and the town of <LOCATION>Kaneohe</LOCATION>. It was still relatively small and low in 
profile. 
</P>
<P>
For nearly two years one of my jobs on the <TIME>night</TIME> desk of the Advertiser had 
been to call the local police departments in <LOCATION>Kaneohe</LOCATION> and other outposts on the 
island to ask if there was any news. The routine never varied: 
</P>
<P>
"This is the Advertiser. Any news tonight?" 
</P>
<P>
"No. No news tonight." 
</P>
<P>
The only time they ever had any news was on <DATE>Dec. 7, 1941</DATE>, and that night I 
never bothered to call. We had enough news. 
</P>
<P>
My wife remembered standing at the pali one day when the eminent pianist <PERSON>Artur 
Rubinstein</PERSON> walked up and stood beside her. He was playing that night in 
<LOCATION>Honolulu</LOCATION> and she went to hear him. Culture is where you find it. 
</P>
<P>
The pali is famous in Hawaiian legend. King Kamehameha, who brought all the 
<LOCATION>Hawaiian Islands</LOCATION> under his crown, is said to have driven the locals to the pali 
and pushed them over, as commemorated in the popular song (as I remember it): 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>King Kamehameha</PERSON>, conqueror of the Islands, 
</P>
<P>
Became a famous hero one day. 
</P>
<P>
He conquered the native army, 
</P>
<P>
And pushed them over the pali 
</P>
<P>
And crowned himself 
</P>
<P>
the king of <ORGANIZATION>Hawaii Nei</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
We drove back down through <LOCATION>Waikiki</LOCATION> and around <ORGANIZATION>Diamond Head</ORGANIZATION> and up into its 
crater, a shallow bowl that has become a park. The old gun emplacements could 
still be seen around its crest. It was supposed to make Oahu impregnable, but 
on <DATE>Dec. 7</DATE> it was helpless against the attack by air. 
</P>
<P>
That evening we dined with three shipmates in the Orchids Room of the 
<LOCATION>Halekulani</LOCATION>, one of the three remaining hotels of the prewar era. It had been a 
charming retreat, a low central building surrounded by cottages. Now the 
cottages were gone, of course, replaced by concrete towers, but the hotel 
itself looked reminiscent of the original, though modernized. 
</P>
<P>
Before dining we had a drink on the terrace overlooking <LOCATION>Waikiki Beach</LOCATION>. Towering 
palm trees were lighted dramatically. A trio of Hawaiian musicians sang the old 
favorites, among them "Farewell My Tane." 
</P>
<P>
My chest tightened. I had learned that song as a scullion on the <ORGANIZATION>S.S. Monterey</ORGANIZATION>. 
At night after our watch the chief scullion, a pure Hawaiian, would get out his 
ukulele and sing Hawaiian songs. My favorite of all he sang was "Farewell My 
Tane." 
</P>
<P>
I used to lie on my bunk in the ship's glory hole (that part of the forecastle 
where the lower forms of marine life lived) and wonder if I would ever meet my 
Tane, and whether our relationship would be that poignant. 
</P>
<P>
 Farewell my <PERSON>Tane</PERSON>, child of a coral sea 
</P>
<P>
We dreamed of heaven, now you've forgotten me 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, I never met my Tane. I married a haole girl, and we are still 
together. 
</P>
<P>
In the morning the hostess at our hotel's restaurant asked whether we wanted 
the American or the Japanese buffet. "What's in the Japanese?" I asked naively. 
"Rice, raw fish . . . ,"she began. "American," I interrupted. 
</P>
<P>
I know the war is over. I am even willing to concede that in some respects the 
Japanese won. But my acceptance of things Japanese does not extend to raw fish. 
</P>
<P>
We flew home in a plane so crowded that my wife and I, having changed from a 
later flight, couldn't sit together. Oh well, we had survived longer 
separations. 
</P>
<P>
I ordered white wine with lunch and the flight attendant brought me a small 
can. The weather was rough, and when I opened it, I discovered from the spots 
on my necktie and my pants, alas, that it was red. 
</P>
<P>
But who could complain? At least the door didn't blow out in flight.

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Harold Bradley Played and Played and Played</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto NS1 of Aug. 28.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actress <PERSON>Sissy Spacek</PERSON>, after recording the
soundtrack to the <DATE>1980</DATE> movie ``Coal Miner's Daughter,'' handed
guitar player <PERSON>Harold Bradley</PERSON> a note.
   ``Pick them strings, guitar man. Loved working with you,'' it
said.
   Bradley did pick. And pick. And pick.
   In the city known worldwide for its guitar players, <PERSON>Bradley</PERSON> has
been the most productive. <PERSON>Chet Atkins</PERSON> is more famous, and <PERSON>Roy Clark</PERSON>
helped popularize the term ``picker,'' but <PERSON>Bradley</PERSON> has been more
prolific.
   In a career spanning 43 years, the 63-year-old <PERSON>Bradley</PERSON> has played
in literally thousands of recording sessions. No one in <LOCATION>Nashville</LOCATION>,
perhaps no one else anywhere, comes close to matching his output.
   ``My career sounds like a lie, but it's really happened,''
<PERSON>Bradley</PERSON> says calmly in a manner that belies the fervor with which he
plays.
   Twelve of the records on which he played with <ORGANIZATION>Elvis Presley</ORGANIZATION>
became million-sellers. Just a few of the other singers he's
accompanied include <PERSON>Willie Nelson</PERSON>, <PERSON>Marie Osmond</PERSON>, <PERSON>Roger Miller</PERSON>,
<PERSON>Loretta Lynn</PERSON>, <PERSON>John Davidson</PERSON>, <PERSON>Patsy Cline</PERSON>, <PERSON>Tom Jones</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Buddy Holly</ORGANIZATION>,
the <ORGANIZATION>Everly Brothers</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Hank Williams</PERSON>, <PERSON>Conway Twitty</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Charley Pride</LOCATION> and
<PERSON>Joan Baez</PERSON>.
   He's played on movie soundtracks such as ``Pink Cadillac'' and
``Smokey and the Bandit II'' in addition to ``Coal Miner's
Daughter.''
   A few of the songs on which he's played include ``Jingle Bell
Rock,'' ``Only the Lonely,'' ``Stand by Your Man,'' ``I'm Sorry,''
``King of the Road,'' ``It's Such a Pretty World Today'' and ``Make
the World Go Away.''
   For good measure, he played at the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1978</DATE>,
accompanying country music stars <PERSON>Tom T. Hall</PERSON>, <PERSON>Lynn</PERSON> and <PERSON>Twitty</PERSON> who
were invited by President <PERSON>Carter</PERSON> to provide some down-home
entertainment.
   This illustrious production came from a musician who taught
himself how to play at age 15 and still practices an average of a
couple hours a day. Even at age 45, he briefly took lessons in
classical music.
   ``I love it,'' he says as he approaches a half-century of
plucking the strings. ``I love to practice. You have to practice.
There is no end to being a good guitar player.
   ``It's like you've got this big jigsaw puzzle in front of you.
You put a few pieces in and you get an idea of the picture. Then you
realize there's more pieces on the outside so you keep trying to put
them in. And you realize you can never fill in the whole thing.''
   Bradley, who does not sing, has been enterprising as well as
busy. For sound effects, he once went to his car and got a pair of
tire chains, returned to the studio and dropped them to the floor
during the recording session for the song ``Chain Gang.''
   He has no preference among the various electric or acoustical
guitars, saying simply: ``I prefer what I'm playing at the time. I
like to play all of 'em.''
   An engaging man with volumes of scrapbooks and memorabilia about
his career, <PERSON>Bradley</PERSON> believes versatility has been his helpmate as
much as ability.
   ``I don't know that I am good. But I can offer experience. I've
been very lucky to play a wide variety of music: country, big band,
rock 'n' roll, gospel.
   ``If I played one kind, I wouldn't have been around this long. If
I was a rock 'n' roll specialist, they would not have needed me on
other recordings that required different abilities.''
   He also plays other instruments, joking that ``I play two in
self-defense, the banjo and mandolin.''
   He says his biggest thrills are those indescribable moments when
musicians combine for special sounds in the studio.
   ``When something magic happens, you get a tremendous high. You
can't turn creativity off and on like water. I've enjoyed that
several times with several artists where it was such a marvelous
music experience that you felt something great happened.''
   Bradley feels that he is still getting better except for his rock
'n' roll playing.
   ``To do that, you have to go out and play it,'' he said. ``And I
play a certain style, rockabilly style, pretty good. But to go out
and play like <PERSON>Van Halen</PERSON> and those guys, no, I'll never do that. But
he'll never come here and play the guitar, the bass guitar, the
banjo, the mandolin, the ukulele. So it's kind of a tradeoff.
   ``What you're buying if you buy me is experience and intonation
and ability. But even that can't guarantee a hit record. The public
decides that.''

<HEAD>Sir Bob Picks Up His Guitar and Plays</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY McSHANE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   <PERSON>Bob Geldof</PERSON>, musician, is back.
   Not <PERSON>St. Bob</PERSON>, the humanitarian of British tabloid headlines. Not
Sir <PERSON>Bob</PERSON>, knighted by <PERSON>Queen Elizabeth</PERSON> in <DATE>1986</DATE>, nominated for the
Nobel Peace Prize that same year. Not author <PERSON>Bob</PERSON>, who's already
written a best-selling autobiography, ``Is That It?'' And not
businessman <PERSON>Bob</PERSON>, who oversaw millions and <MONEY>millions of dollars</MONEY> in
contributions for the starving Third World.
   Geldof remains chairman of the board of trustees for Band Aid,
although he says the organization will cease to exist fairly soon.
But his main focus these days is ``The Vegetarians of Love,'' his
critically acclaimed second solo album.
   This is no Boomtown Rats rock 'n' roll extravaganza; <PERSON>Geldof</PERSON> has
instead assembled a mostly acoustic band featuring accordion,
violins, flute, tin whistle, mandolin and ukulele.
   ``For me, I suppose, it's simply a reaction to stuff I hear on
the radio which I don't like _ basically, house music and New Kids
on the Block or <PERSON>Kylie Minogue</PERSON>,'' <PERSON>Geldof</PERSON> said in a recent interview.
   For the new album, <PERSON>Geldof</PERSON> enlisted an old friend _ ex-Rats
bassist <PERSON>Pete Briquette</PERSON> _ and four traditional musicians he'd never
met. They recorded 28 songs in five days; any song that didn't
click after three takes was thrown out. Geldof improvised many of
the lyrics on the spot.
   ``I came in on <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME>, said hello to four guys I didn't
know ... I'd bash out a song and say, `Right! OK, let's go,' ''
<PERSON>Geldof</PERSON> recalled of the session.
   ``They'd say, `What do you want me to play?' I'd say, `Whatever
you want to play.' They'd say, `Where do you want me to play it?'
I'd say, `Wherever you feel its right.' And `When does the song
finish?' And I'd say, `When it stops, it's over.' ''
   The spontaneity shows. On ``A Gospel Song,'' <PERSON>Geldof</PERSON> tells the
band ``middle eight coming up'' during an instrumental break.
Geldof asks at the start of another cut, ``Are we rolling?'' And at
the end of ``The Great Song of Indifference,'' the entire band is
heard laughing loudly.
   ``Indifference'' is already a Top 40 hit in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>. ``The last
thing everybody expected was this Irish pub song. And it became a
big dance hit, you know? Thirteenth-century dance music,'' says
<PERSON>Geldof</PERSON>, laughing.
   After almost a decade as front man for the New Wave-era Boomtown
Rats, <PERSON>Geldof</PERSON> became a household name in <DATE>1984</DATE> _ by organizing the
cream of British musicians to record ``Do They Know It's
Christmas?'' and raise money for African famine victims.
   That was followed by <ORGANIZATION>USA</ORGANIZATION> for <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>'s ``We Are the World'' and
the internationally televised Live Aid benefit. For two years,
<PERSON>Geldof</PERSON> met with heads of state and political power brokers; the
scruffy Irishman was photographed with everyone from <ORGANIZATION>Nobelist
Mother Theresa</ORGANIZATION> to British Prime Minister <PERSON>Margaret Thatcher</PERSON>.
   Geldof looks back on those days with pride tempered by the
realization there was only so much that could be done.
   ``I mean, I never said we were going to stop world poverty or
world hunger. I said it was a Band-Aid. `You don't put a Band-Aid
on a gaping wound,' if I remember, was the quote at the time,''
said <PERSON>Geldof</PERSON>.
   ``That wasn't the function, to stop world hunger. It was to
raise the issue to the top of the political agenda, and we did
that.''
   Geldof is still the nominal head of the organization: ``I'm the
chairman of the board of trustees, which requires me to go to a
meeting once every two months. In reality, the buck still stops
here.''
   But he says projects are winding down, and the end of Band Aid
could come in <DATE>1992</DATE>.
   ``We have a million pounds left, which is contingency, which we
don't touch, in case there's an emergency or a shortfall on a
project,'' said <PERSON>Geldof</PERSON>. ``When all that's finished, about two
years, then we just close.''
   So <PERSON>Geldof</PERSON> is back with his first love, music. He's not sure if
``Vegetarians'' will be his long-awaited commercial breakthrough,
and he's aware that there's no immediate market for his songs on
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> radio.
   ``So what if it doesn't fit? It's still music,'' says <PERSON>Geldof</PERSON>.
``For every 3 million people who love <LOCATION>Bon Jovi</LOCATION>, there's a quarter
of a million who can't stand it. I'm not at all bitter. I'm sort of
philosophical.''
   The philosopher looks much the same as he did at Live Aid,
except for the bit of gray in his unruly mop of hair. Geldof
considers the music scene today, and he sees many of the same
things flourishing which led to the punk scene.
   ``I feel a real sort of betrayal now when I listen to the radio.
I understand that this is now a giant, monolithic industry, and I
understand so many millions of people depend on their livelihoods
for it, and they play it safe,'' said <PERSON>Geldof</PERSON>.

<P>
Children's recording artist <PERSON>David Jack</PERSON> tries out new songs on a discriminating 
audience -- his 4-year-old son Benjamin. "If Benjamin likes it, it's a go," 
<PERSON>Jack</PERSON> says. 
</P>
<P>
So far, <PERSON>Benjamin</PERSON> is on a roll: His dad's "Don't Wake Up the Baby" and "Dance in 
Your Pants" audiotapes were hot enough to be picked up by national 
distributors; "Dance in Your Pants" won the <DATE>1988</DATE> "Parents Choice Award" for 
excellence. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Jack</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> native, is <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION>'s manager of music operations, working on 
in-house programming and license negotiations. In his free time, he performs 
his songs. 
</P>
<P>
<DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME> at 2, children and parents can hear <PERSON>Jack</PERSON> in concert at <LOCATION>Kids 
Gym</LOCATION>, 12526 <ORGANIZATION>Riverside Drive</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Studio City</LOCATION>, (818) 343-7116. Tickets are <MONEY>$2.50</MONEY> per 
child, <MONEY>$5</MONEY> per adult. 
</P>
<P>
For ages 1 and up ("a 9-year-old won't be bored," he says), it will be 40 
minutes of music and audience participation: singing, clapping and dancing. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Canadian children's singer superstar, <PERSON>Jack</PERSON> describes himself 
as "like Raffi, only hipper." (<ORGANIZATION>Raffi</ORGANIZATION> often sings familiar children's standards 
as well as folk and contemporary songs.) 
</P>
<P>
"I want to separate myself from the people who do the same 'Old <PERSON>MacDonald</PERSON>' 
stuff," he says. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Jack</PERSON>, 29, dark-haired, wide-grinned and irrepressible, may or may not be hipper 
than <PERSON>Raffi</PERSON>, but his work has contagious appeal. "Dance in Your Pants" is a 
bouncy, professional mix of styles from jazz and gentle rock to Hawaiian 
ukulele. 
</P>
<P>
Lyrics, by older sister <PERSON>Susan Jack Cooper</PERSON>, a San Diego-based writer, are 
guaranteed children-pleasers: 
</P>
<P>
 "Suppose I said my tuna fish was calling on the phone? Or at my door was a 
dinosaur with a chocolate ice cream cone?" and "Are there 'tee-hees' in your 
T-shirt? Are there 'ha-ha's' in your hat? Do your shorts just hop and never 
stop? Well, what you gonna do about that?" 
</P>
<P>
The collaboration with <PERSON>Cooper</PERSON>, who "still calls me her kid brother," started 
when <PERSON>Jack</PERSON> graduated from <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION> with a degree in music education. It became 
serious when <PERSON>Benjamin</PERSON> was born. 
</P>
<P>
"I was looking for some good children's music," <PERSON>Jack</PERSON> says, "and I found the 
same old rehashed stuff we grew up with. So we wrote our first song, 
"Sleepies." From there, we decided to do an album of lullabies that would give 
a child a sense of family. ("I like us, I like this family, I like this house I 
live in, I'm glad I'm me.") 
</P>
<P>
After that, writing a second album that "little kids could dance to" seemed a 
natural progression. Jack and <PERSON>Cooper</PERSON> are now working on a third, "Gotta Hop!" 
</P>
<P>
Since <PERSON>Cooper</PERSON> lives in <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>, it means working on the phone and through the 
mail, but <PERSON>Jack</PERSON> says he always looks forward to their face-to-face collaboration 
"because I know we're going to laugh." 
</P>
<P>
Jack's Ta-Dum Production company is definitely a family affair. Jack's father, 
a retired music teacher, plays oboe on the tapes, and brother <LOCATION>Louis</LOCATION> plays 
piccolo. Jack supplies drums and keyboard as well as vocals. 
</P>
<P>
His mother, also a music teacher, serves as marketing manager. She took "Don't 
Wake Up the Baby" "to nursery schools and small stores until it was eventually 
picked up by the <ORGANIZATION>Columbia House Record Club</ORGANIZATION>" and other national distributors. 
</P>
<P>
His wife, <PERSON>Vicky</PERSON>, a former nursery school teacher who is expecting their second 
child this <DATE>summer</DATE>, serves as educational consultant. Even Benjamin makes a 
vocal appearance on both cassettes. 
</P>
<P>
Jack says he writes his music not only for children, but for parents who "are 
looking for entertaining music that doesn't drive them crazy to hear over and 
over, music with a message in it somewhere that a child can extract without 
knowing it." 
</P>
<P>
But "first and foremost," he says, "our music says, 'Enjoy yourselves, be happy 
with yourselves and with the things that you can do.' " 
</P>
<P>
After the <ORGANIZATION>Studio City</ORGANIZATION> concert <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, <PERSON>Jack</PERSON> will do two free concerts: one in 
<LOCATION>Pasadena</LOCATION> at <TIME>1 p.m.</TIME> <DATE>March 11</DATE> at A Child's Fancy, 140 <ORGANIZATION>W. Colorado Blvd.</ORGANIZATION> (818) 
793-4085, and one in <LOCATION>Santa Monica</LOCATION> at noon <DATE>March 25</DATE> at <ORGANIZATION>Quinby</ORGANIZATION>'s, <DATE>1109</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>Montana 
Ave.</ORGANIZATION> (213) 394-1141.

<DESCRIPT>  THEATER; SHOW; REVIEW  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  'BELLE Reprieve" should have been a hoot. But it ain't.;   When two gay
theater troupes -- a London company called Bloolips and a New York lesbian
company called Split Britches -- set out to deconstruct "A Streetcar Named
Desire," they ought to have had only one problem: culling the material into a
manageable show.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Eye  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  'BELLE' BENDS GENDERS WHILE DERAILING 'STREETCAR'  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  PERFORMANCE  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     They culled, all right, but eccentrically. Eight irrelevant songs -- nine
if you count the overture, a lesbian revision of "Someone to Watch Over Me" --
have been inserted, as well as a fairy with a ukulele, whom I don't recall
from "Streetcar" (but perhaps I've got one of those expurgated '50s
editions).;   In order to embarrass us with all these riches, the
actor-writers have unencumbered the play of plot, structure and through-line.;
  Lord knows there's enough to parody in <LOCATION>Tennessee Williams</LOCATION>, for the first
half of his life one of the most miserable homosexuals on record and for the
last half one of the drunkest.;   Literature critics have had a field day with
gender analyses of his work. The great roles he wrote for women -- Blanche in
"Streetcar" and <PERSON>Maggie</PERSON> the Cat -- are thinly disguised portraits of himself,
and the men in their lives are brutal, like <PERSON>Stanley Kowalski</PERSON>, or aloof and
enigmatic, like Brick in "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof," or charming heels, as both
also are.;   However, Split Britches and <PERSON>Bloolips</PERSON> explore this fertile ground
only in the last eight minutes of their play, prefacing the tragicomic
gender-bender confrontation of Blanche and <ORGANIZATION>Stanley</ORGANIZATION> with 112 other minutes of
nonsense.;   Some of it's funny; a lot is tasteless; some is just there. The
title, for instance, is a parody: The old plantation in "Streetcar" is <LOCATION>Belle
Reve</LOCATION>, pronounced reeve. Nothing much comes of it.;   But a few bits are right
on the mark, such as a bathtub dialogue between Blanche and <PERSON>Stella</PERSON> that
lampoons every crossed-purpose conversation <ORGANIZATION>Williams</ORGANIZATION> ever wrote. And the
script is cleverly intercut with passages from "The Glass Menagerie,"
"Suddenly Last Summer" and (I think) a lot of the later,REVIEW; forgettable
plays; and -- of course -- <PERSON>Bette Davis</PERSON> movies. (This is, after all, gay
theater.);   But all of it could have been scrapped in favor of starting at
Point A and progressing, just for laughs, to Point B and so on. That shows you
how boring and Aristotelian I am.;   Blanche is played by "<PERSON>Bette Bourne</PERSON>," a
co-founder of Bloolips, who looks like <PERSON>Vivien Leigh</PERSON> in an advanced state of
decay. He whistles quite operatically. <PERSON>Mitch</PERSON>, played by one "Precious Pearl,"
acts grayly but plays the ukulele very well for a beginner.;   Stella and
<ORGANIZATION>Stanley</ORGANIZATION> are enacted by <PERSON>Lois Weaver</PERSON> and <PERSON>Peggy Shaw</PERSON>, co-founders of Split
Britches and longtime partners who are mostly interested in "getting those
colored lights going." Their acting is indescribable, though "lousy" gets us
about halfway there, until <PERSON>Weaver</PERSON>'s <PERSON>Marilyn Monroe</PERSON> parody, which leaves me
speechless.;   I am not given to comment on women's physical attributes, but
<ORGANIZATION>Shaw</ORGANIZATION> in the famous <PERSON>Stanley Kowalski</PERSON> singlet, sans bra, is not a sight for the
faint-hearted.;   The cast taps rather neatly, and its singing is bearable
when covered by the piano, whose ivories were tickled by one "Laka Daisical."
Pearl does a wonderful straight-faced recitation of "My Way," whose words are
three times as dumb when divorced from their monotonous melody. I liked the
two cream-pie jokes and the dancing votive candles.;   This thing, whose <LOCATION>West
Coast</LOCATION> premiere is being presented by Theater Rhino, won an Obie Award this
year -- and for "ensemble performance," no less, a quality that shows up only
in the tap-dance finale. There are several possible answers: The jury was
asleep, the other contenders were desperately bad, the jury was asleep . . . I
vote for the first and last.; Belle Reprieve; Bloolips/Split Britches;
Producer: Theater Rhino; Through: <DATE>Oct. 27</DATE>; Where: <PERSON>Victoria Theater</PERSON>, 2961 16th

<P>
<PERSON>Bob Geldof</PERSON>, musician, is back. 
</P>
<P>
Not <PERSON>St. Bob</PERSON>, the humanitarian of British tabloid headlines. Not Sir <PERSON>Bob</PERSON>, 
knighted by <PERSON>Queen Elizabeth</PERSON> in <DATE>1986</DATE>, nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize that 
same year. Not author <PERSON>Bob</PERSON>, who's already written a best-selling autobiography, 
"Is That It?" And not businessman <PERSON>Bob</PERSON>, who oversaw millions and <MONEY>millions of 
dollars</MONEY> in contributions for the starving Third World. 
</P>
<P>
Geldof remains chairman of the board of trustees of Band Aid, although he says 
the organization will cease to exist fairly soon. But his main focus these days 
is "The Vegetarians of Love," his critically acclaimed second solo album. 
</P>
<P>
This is no Boomtown Rats rock 'n' roll extravaganza; <PERSON>Geldof</PERSON> has instead 
assembled a mostly acoustic band featuring accordion, violins, flute, tin 
whistle, mandolin and ukulele. 
</P>
<P>
"For me, I suppose, it's simply a reaction to stuff I hear on the radio which I 
don't like -- basically, house music and New Kids on the Block or <PERSON>Kylie 
Minogue</PERSON>," <PERSON>Geldof</PERSON> said in a recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
For the new album, <PERSON>Geldof</PERSON> enlisted an old friend -- ex-Rats bassist <PERSON>Pete 
Briquette</PERSON> -- and four traditional musicians he had never met. They recorded 28 
songs in five days; any song that didn't click after three takes was thrown 
out. Geldof improvised many of the lyrics on the spot. 
</P>
<P>
The spontaneity shows. On "A Gospel Song," <PERSON>Geldof</PERSON> tells the band "middle eight 
coming up" during an instrumental break. Geldof asks at the start of another 
cut, "Are we rolling?" And at the end of "The Great Song of Indifference," the 
entire band is heard laughing loudly. 
</P>
<P>
"Indifference" is already a Top 40 hit in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>. "The last thing everybody 
expected was this Irish pub song. And it became a big dance hit, you know? 
Thirteenth-Century dance music," said <PERSON>Geldof</PERSON>, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
After almost a decade as front man for the New Wave-era Boomtown Rats, <PERSON>Geldof</PERSON> 
became a household name in <DATE>1984</DATE> by organizing the cream of British musicians to 
record "Do They Know It's Christmas?" to raise money for African famine 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
That was followed by <ORGANIZATION>USA</ORGANIZATION> for <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>'s "We Are the World" and the 
internationally televised Live Aid benefit. For two years, <PERSON>Geldof</PERSON> met with 
heads of state and political power brokers; the scruffy Irishman was 
photographed with everyone from <ORGANIZATION>Nobelist Mother Teresa</ORGANIZATION> to British Prime 
Minister <PERSON>Margaret Thatcher</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
Geldof looks back on those days with pride tempered by the realization that 
there was only so much that could be done. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, I never said we were going to stop world poverty or world hunger. I 
said it was a Band-Aid. 'You don't put a Band-Aid on a gaping wound,' if I 
remember, was the quote at the time," <PERSON>Geldof</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
"That wasn't the function, to stop world hunger. It was to raise the issue to 
the top of the political agenda, and we did that."

   <PERSON>Neil Young</PERSON> had just seen the movie
``Spinal Tap'' for the first time. And his life took on new
meaning.
   ``That's my life. My life is `Spinal Tap,''' said <PERSON>Young</PERSON>,
reaching for the morning's first cup of coffee.
   The <DATE>1984</DATE> mock documentary follows hapless rockers on tour, their
future imperiled by a rift with the band's co-founder. Young, who
turned 45 on <DATE>Nov. 12</DATE>, doesn't struggle like those low-rent
musicians. He was, though, estranged, saying a few years ago he
never would play again with longtime companions <ORGANIZATION>Crazy Horse</ORGANIZATION>.
   But now Young has recorded an album with the legendary bar band.
   Awestruck critics say ``Ragged Glory'' resurrects Young's
spontaneous, hard-driving rock 'n' roll. That freewheeling sound
was shelved at times in favor of <ORGANIZATION>Young</ORGANIZATION>'s acoustic ballads and
country rock on solo albums and collaborations with <ORGANIZATION>Mynah Birds</ORGANIZATION>,
<LOCATION>Buffalo Springfield</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Crosby</PERSON>, Stills and <PERSON>Nash</PERSON>.
   Young said the time was right to reunite with <ORGANIZATION>Crazy Horse</ORGANIZATION>. Any
bad blood between him and the band is forgotten.
   ``Crazy Horse is a band that I'm a part of,'' said <PERSON>Young</PERSON>,
wearing his standard uniform: jeans, T-shirt, tennis shoes, <PERSON>Ray
Bans</PERSON> and stubble. ``I lead the band, yeah. But I'm just a member.
It's like returning to your roots. It brings me back to where I
started.''
   Two of <ORGANIZATION>Young</ORGANIZATION>'s most popular and acclaimed albums - <DATE>1975</DATE>'s
``Tonight's the Night'' and <DATE>1979</DATE>'s ``Rust Never Sleeps'' - were
recorded with <ORGANIZATION>Crazy Horse</ORGANIZATION>. Their first effort together was <DATE>1969</DATE>'s
``Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere.'' Their last was <DATE>1986</DATE>'s
``Life.''
   Crazy Horse's own new album is titled ``Left for Dead'' in part,
the band members say, because Young and others in the business
abandoned them. In ``Ragged Glory,'' Young is joined by <ORGANIZATION>Crazy
Horse</ORGANIZATION>'s guitarist <PERSON>Frank Sampedro</PERSON>, bassist <PERSON>Billy Talbot</PERSON> and drummer
<PERSON>Ralph Molina</PERSON>.
   ``It may be the best one I've ever done with them,'' <PERSON>Young</PERSON> said.
``It's even. And that's a little peculiar. There's not one song
that really stands out.''
   Last year, Young released what some considered the best album of
<DATE>1989</DATE> and perhaps of his career: ``Freedom.'' Young, who's hardly
given to flowery self-promotion, believes ``Ragged Glory'' is
superior.
   ``I was amazed at the success of `Freedom,' not because I didn't
think it was good, but I was surprised that its shortcomings were
not mentioned more often,'' <PERSON>Young</PERSON> said.
   And what were these shortcomings? ``Well, `Ragged Glory' has
what `Freedom' doesn't have,'' he said. ```Freedom' was OK to
listen to; it's got all the soft songs. But in this album, we'll
lose all the people who like the soft songs.''
   Indeed, only one track on ``Ragged Glory'' - ``Days That Used to
Be'' - could be considered contemplative both lyrically and
musically.
   Filled with longing reminiscences of the '60s - ``Psychedelic
music fills the air, Peace and love live there still'' - the
melancholy song says that personal dreams are threatened by
``possessions and concessions.''
   ``I usually shy away from this kind of song,'' <PERSON>Young</PERSON> said a few
days before setting off on another trip on his sailboat. ``I was in
the middle of the ocean on my boat, halfway between here and there,
and had been there for about 10 days. No airplanes. No other boats.
No noise. But I did see a couple of humpback whales. The song came
to me.''
   The album was recorded at <ORGANIZATION>Young</ORGANIZATION>'s 2,000-acre ranch.
   The band doesn't rehearse, arranges on the spot and avoids
re-recording takes to cover glitches or raw edges. The album stands
like a piece of unfinished furniture.
   ``It doesn't matter how you get it as long as it sounds good in
the end,'' said bassist <PERSON>Talbot</PERSON>. ``People make music, not the
instruments. It's just us hanging out together.''
   On a whim, the band recorded the R&amp;B classic ``Farmer John'' for
the album, even though Young was the only one who knew how to play
it. That carefree approach carries over to <ORGANIZATION>Young</ORGANIZATION>'s songwriting,
too.
   ``I don't sit down and say I'll play a G or something. It's
mindless. It's the other way around from what most people think. It
comes to you and you grab it and then find out what it is.''
   Young was born in <LOCATION>Toronto</LOCATION> and received a ukulele as a Christmas
gift at age 13. He joined the <PERSON>Squires</PERSON> in <DATE>1963</DATE>, and met <PERSON>Stephen
Stills</PERSON> soon thereafter; he teamed with Stills in <LOCATION>Buffalo
Springfield</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Crosby</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Stills Nash &amp; Young</ORGANIZATION>.
   Throughout his career, he has been irreverent. His <DATE>1988</DATE> song,
``This Note's for You,'' a critique of commercialism in the music
business, yielded a controversial and award-winning video.
   ``I'm the lost character in this place because I don't know
where I fit,'' <PERSON>Young</PERSON> said. ``The record company is building an
image, grooming you. I have no idea what that's all about. Where do
I fit with this?''

that really stands out.''
   Last year, Young released what some considered the best album of
<DATE>1989</DATE> and perhaps of his career: ``Freedom.'' Young, who's hardly
given to flowery self-promotion, believes ``Ragged Glory'' is
superior.
   ``I was amazed at the success of `Freedom,' not because I didn't
think it was good, but I was surprised that its shortcomings were
not mentioned more often,'' <PERSON>Young</PERSON> said.
   And what were these shortcomings? ``Well, `Ragged Glory' has
what `Freedom' doesn't have,'' he said. ```Freedom' was OK to
listen to; it's got all the soft songs. But in this album, we'll
lose all the people who like the soft songs.''
   Indeed, only one track on ``Ragged Glory'' - ``Days That Used to
Be'' - could be considered contemplative both lyrically and
musically.
   Filled with longing reminiscences of the '60s - ``Psychedelic
music fills the air, Peace and love live there still'' - the
melancholy song says that personal dreams are threatened by
``possessions and concessions.''
   ``I usually shy away from this kind of song,'' <PERSON>Young</PERSON> said a few
days before setting off on another trip on his sailboat. ``I was in
the middle of the ocean on my boat, halfway between here and there,
and had been there for about 10 days. No airplanes. No other boats.
No noise. But I did see a couple of humpback whales. The song came
to me.''
   The album was recorded at <ORGANIZATION>Young</ORGANIZATION>'s 2,000-acre ranch.
   The band doesn't rehearse, arranges on the spot and avoids
re-recording takes to cover glitches or raw edges. The album stands
like a piece of unfinished furniture.
   ``It doesn't matter how you get it as long as it sounds good in
the end,'' said bassist <PERSON>Talbot</PERSON>. ``People make music, not the
instruments. It's just us hanging out together.''
   On a whim, the band recorded the R&amp;B classic ``Farmer John'' for
the album, even though Young was the only one who knew how to play
it. That carefree approach carries over to <ORGANIZATION>Young</ORGANIZATION>'s songwriting,
too.
   ``I don't sit down and say I'll play a G or something. It's
mindless. It's the other way around from what most people think. It
comes to you and you grab it and then find out what it is.''
   Young was born in <LOCATION>Toronto</LOCATION> and received a ukulele as a Christmas
gift at age 13. He joined the <PERSON>Squires</PERSON> in <DATE>1963</DATE>, and met <PERSON>Stephen
Stills</PERSON> soon thereafter; he teamed with Stills in <LOCATION>Buffalo
Springfield</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Crosby</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Stills Nash &amp; Young</ORGANIZATION>.
   Throughout his career, he has been irreverent. His <DATE>1988</DATE> song,
``This Note's for You,'' a critique of commercialism in the music
business, yielded a controversial and award-winning video.
   ``I'm the lost character in this place because I don't know
where I fit,'' <PERSON>Young</PERSON> said. ``The record company is building an
image, grooming you. I have no idea what that's all about. Where do
I fit with this?''

<DESCRIPT>  DANCE; REVIEW  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  NOBODY, but nobody, has done more for Broadway dance than Jerome Robbins.;   
He broke into show biz at a time when "musical theater" meant glorified revues
or plays-with-inserted-songs, and he changed all that. He invented theatrical
dance that established the mood, advanced the plot, described and shaped
character -- and was, still and foremost, fabulous dance. All the while, he
maintained a productive profile in classical ballet.  </LEADPARA>

HIS DANCES STOPPED SHOWS. BUT 'JEROME ROBBINS'
BROADWAY' IS SIMPLY STOPPED STILL  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  PERFORMANCE
REVIEW  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     "<PERSON>Jerome Robbins</PERSON>' Broadway" was his slightly belated 70th birthday gift (it
opened in <DATE>1989</DATE>, when he was 71) to the street that saw his greatest successes,
including such landmark works as "West Side Story" (<DATE>1957</DATE>) and "Fiddler on the
Roof" (<DATE>1964</DATE>).;    I can't begrudge the national tour (which pulled into the
Golden Gate <DATE>Theater this week</DATE> for a limited engagement that ends <DATE>Sept. 8</DATE>) its
advance sales, because <PERSON>Robbins</PERSON>' work is so wonderful that seeing this much of
it under any circumstances is a must. But I think it could look better than it
does.;    It contains excerpts from nine shows, including major set-pieces
from "Billion-Dollar Baby" (<DATE>1945</DATE>), "High-Button Shoes" (<DATE>1947</DATE>) and "The King
and I" (<DATE>1951</DATE>), and a 40-minute chunk of "West Side Story" that includes all
the big dance numbers.;    But what's the connection, besides <PERSON>Robbins</PERSON>? The
libretto is bald and haphazard, and it gets no assist at all from <PERSON>Paul
Kreppel</PERSON>'s unengaging performance as the narrator (as well as Tevye in
"Fiddler" and Pseudolus in "A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum").
The approach is neither chronological nor thematic; if it's based on anything
at all, it's backstage traffic (How many dancers need to make a costume change
here? And how fast can they do it?) -- which is no way to plan a show of this
size and scope.;    The company is unmemorable, except for <PERSON>Leilani Jones</PERSON>, a
Hawaiian-born performer who croons the show's unknown song, the sinuous "<PERSON>Mr.
Monotony</PERSON>," in a tigress' purr. She's also the fiery Anita in "<LOCATION>America</LOCATION>" from
"West Side Story" (which is done in its stage version, as an all-female
number). Fortunately, her miscastings -- as the narrator for "The <ORGANIZATION>Small House</ORGANIZATION>
of Uncle Thomas" (the Siamese "Uncle Tom's Cabin" in "The King and I") and
<PERSON>Grandma Tzeitel</PERSON> in the dream sequence of "Fiddler" -- were disguised by her
costumes.;    A <LOCATION>New York City Ballet</LOCATION> dancer, <PERSON>Alexia Hess</PERSON>, is the putative
leaddancer, but her roles are limited to colorless non-dance parts: Maria in
the cha-cha from "West Side Story" and the shy girl, <PERSON>Louise</PERSON>, who isn't yet
grown into <PERSON>Gypsy Rose Lee</PERSON> when three strippers strut their stuff for her in
"You Gotta Have a Gimmick" from "Gypsy.";    But the choreography makes up for
all. Robbins is brilliant and versatile, and there's something of all his
gifts here. The beach-cabana sequence from "High-Button Shoes" is an
affectionate parody of all <PERSON>Mack Sennett</PERSON> production numbers, but it also zips
through the plot and perpetrators with clarity and economy, like one of those
portraits you used to be able to buy for a dime from a seaside sketcher. And
it's wonderfully funny.;    So is the <LOCATION>Charleston</LOCATION> from "Billion-Dollar Baby,"
which presents every cliche of the Prohibition era -- flappers, coppers,
gangsters, bootleggers and speakeasy sophisticates with raccoon coats, porkpie
hats and ukuleles -- in a wild chase and great dance number all in one.;   
"Uncle Thomas" brightly mixes Balinese dance and Chinese and Japanese
classical theatrics with a dash of humor and a dash of pathos, reconciling the
contradictions in <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> and Western storytelling even as it exploits them.
"Gimmick" is pure shtick, but what shtick! And its innocence somehow cancels
its hard-bitten subject matter (the exploitation of women's bodies).;    And
for pure dance-drama, what has ever topped "West Side Story"? The dangerous
beauty of its disaffected teen-agers, their exuberant claim on territory and
time, the moves that combine menace and vulnerability -- after all the years
and so many imitations, these still read as powerfully as when they first
appeared. (Incidentally, I just saw "West Side Story" and "The King and I" on
video, and <PERSON>Robbins</PERSON>' dances survive virtually intact in both, though in "West
Side Story" the brilliant camera-work -- directed by <PERSON>Robbins</PERSON> for the dance
sequences -- require you to be an active partner in making sense out of the
choreographic whole.);    It's too bad the show looks so scrappy -- not
disgraceful, but not quite polished. Robbins is supposed to be a fierce
perfectionist, but this production doesn't look as though a perfectionist got
anywhere near it. The dancers have a lot of energy and exuberance and nearly
every number is attractive, but the dazzle meridian remains stubbornly
uncrossed. And a few pieces -- e.g., "Comedy Tonight" from "Forum" -- are
positively unkempt.;    As if that weren't enough damning with faint praise,
the design is dullsville. The original designers -- <PERSON>Raoul Pene du Bois</PERSON>, <PERSON>Irene
Sharaff</PERSON>, <PERSON>Tony Walton</PERSON>, <PERSON>Patricia Zipprodt</PERSON>, <PERSON>Boris Aronson</PERSON>, <PERSON>Jo Mielziner</PERSON> and
<PERSON>Oliver Smith</PERSON>, among others -- are credited in the program, but the costumes
look as though they came out of stock and the backdrops like charmless,
quickie cartoons. (Did the Sharks and Jets in the original production wear
matching letter jackets, as if they were neighborhood softball teams?) A
national touring show with this budget shouldn't look like this.;     <PERSON>Jerome

<LEADPARA>  What's that? You say your plans for a Hawaiian vacation died somewhere between
the mortgage payment and the car-insurance premium? You can stop crying into
that floral-print shirt and cheer up -- because two of the most-acclaimed
practitioners of real Hawaiian music are on their way to the Bay Area.;   
Raymond Kane, probably Hawaii's greatest living slack-key guitar player, spent
more than 60 years mastering the unwritten rules of the folk idiom. His
intricate guitar style -- with rhythm and lead played simultaneously -- and
his resonant, haunting vocals are one-of-a-kind. George Kuo is a master
ukulele player and, like Kane, an accomplished storyteller and folk-historian.  </LEADPARA>

FT  04 OCT 93 / Arts: Experience the divine Bette Midler - New York
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FRICKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With the Broadway theatre season still a few weeks off, <PERSON>Bette Midler</PERSON> is
about the only show in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> these days. She is playing a six-week stint
at <ORGANIZATION>Radio City Music Hall</ORGANIZATION>, where her famously loyal following is paying up to
Dollars 100 per ticket to Experience the Divine, as the concert is called.
(Though the run, which ends <DATE>October 23</DATE>, is ostensibly sold out, there are
returns available at Radio City most evenings).
<PERSON>Midler</PERSON> has not appeared in a major concert for 10 years - she has been busy
becoming internationally famous - and there was much speculation about which
<PERSON>Bette</PERSON> we were going to see: the raunchy, raucous 'Divine Miss M', who got
her start singing in gay bathhouses in the <DATE>1970s</DATE>, or the kinder, gentler
<DATE>1980s</DATE> <PERSON>Bette</PERSON>, she of Disney films (Down and Out in <LOCATION>Beverly Hills</LOCATION>, Beaches)
and treacly top-10 pop songs (From a Distance, <ORGANIZATION>Wind Beneath my Wings</ORGANIZATION>).
Experience the Diviney mixture of both <PERSON>Bettes</PERSON>. Alternately brassy and coy,
loud and girlish, belting and crooning, <PERSON>Midler</PERSON> owns the stage; she is simply
one of the best live entertainers around (two of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s other great divas
 -<PERSON>Shirley MacLaine</PERSON> and <PERSON>Liza Minnelli</PERSON> - were in the audience, adding to the
starry frisson). Platinum blond and slender, <PERSON>Midler</PERSON> has never looked better,
and she knows it; one of her first songs is a playful rap called 'I Look
Good'. She is well into her forties, but her asides about 'being too old for
this' are clearly disingenuous; the show lasts three hours, and <PERSON>Midler</PERSON>'s
energy never flags.
Midler knows that her ballads are what the audience - mostly middle-aged
suburbanites - wants, and she works through them all, backed with
appropriate lushness by a seven-piece band. But the concert's divinest
moments are when she is in high-attitude mode; she hits her stride halfway
through the first set with her torchy old hit '<ORGANIZATION>Delta Dawn</ORGANIZATION>' ('This song's
from the 70s . . . as are most of you. Hell, so am I]')
The brassy spirit of <PERSON>Sophie Tucker</PERSON>, the legendary vaudeville performer and
<PERSON>Midler</PERSON>'s idol, hangs over the concert, and <PERSON>Midler</PERSON> conjures her directly in a
series of bawdy jokes she delivers as 'Soph'. <PERSON>Midler</PERSON>'s onstage identity,
like <PERSON>Tucker</PERSON>'s, has much to do with her Jewishness, and she gets a lot of
comic mileage out of the recent <ORGANIZATION>High Holy Days</ORGANIZATION> and out of current political
events ('Oy] This food] If Yassir Arafat knew what our food was like, this
treaty would be off in a second]'). She finishes off the first set with a
rousing 'Rose's Turn' from the classic <PERSON>Jule Styne</PERSON> musical Gypsy, a nifty
piece of advertising for a television version of the musical that she is
starring in this autumn.
The second set veers quickly into high camp, with a routine that <PERSON>Midler</PERSON>
aficionados found hilarious but which mystified me - the performer was in
the guise of <PERSON>Dolores Delago</PERSON>, a blue-tailed mermaid in a motorised wheelchair
who spouts self-help palaver.
While the band and backup singers (who <PERSON>Midler</PERSON> calls 'The Harlettes') make
their way through a ukulele number (a tribute, perhaps, to <PERSON>Midler</PERSON>'s roots;
she was born and raised in <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>), <PERSON>Midler</PERSON> changes into a sophisticated
beige cocktail dress and then offers a particularly committed rendition of
the classic wailer, 'Stay With Me, <ORGANIZATION>Baby</ORGANIZATION>'.
An old-fashioned entertainer, <PERSON>Midler</PERSON> ends the concert with old-fashioned
good manners, coming out after the final encore to wish the audience
good-night and tell them they are fabulous. So is she.

<TEXT>     It's also the kind of talk that can be heard at the <ORGANIZATION>Huntington Beach
International Surfing Museum.</ORGANIZATION>;   At a time when surfing museums are becoming
more popular -- with museums in <LOCATION>Santa Cruz</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mission Beach</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ventura</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> -- the 2,200-square-foot facility stands apart. Opened in <DATE>July 1988</DATE>,
the museum is billed as the world's largest tribute to surfing. "It offers a
unique, international collection of surfboards and surfing-related artifacts,"
said <PERSON>Ann Beasley</PERSON>, the non-profit museum's executive officer.;   It also
provides an education in surfing, say museum visitors and professional
surfers.;    A little perspective; "I'm happy that young kids can go to a
place where they can take an interest in surfing and (find out) where it all
came from. It adds a little depth and perspective to the sport," said <PERSON>David
Nuuhiwa</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Oceanside</LOCATION>, a five-time national surfing champion during the late
<DATE>1960s</DATE> and early <DATE>1970s</DATE>. Now 42, <ORGANIZATION>Nuuhiwa</ORGANIZATION> surfs professionally on the masters
circuit.;   <PERSON>Tom Andrusky</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Huntington Beach</LOCATION>, a non-surfer visiting the museum
for the fourth time, said he was impressed with the presentation of surfing
history.;   "You can learn a lot in a very short time in a very small space,"
Andrusky said.;   For example, he discovered that Capt. <PERSON>James Cook</PERSON> of the
British navy first documented surfing in <DATE>1778</DATE>, after he witnessed natives
using large boards to slide along waves off the <LOCATION>Sandwich Islands</LOCATION>, later to be
called <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>. The origins of surfing are unknown, however.;   Closer to home,
Hawaiian surfer <PERSON>George Freeth</PERSON> is credited with introducing the sport to
<LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION> in <DATE>1907</DATE>, and the rest is gnarly history, dude.;   Surfing
has given a major boost to the economy of <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION>, said
<PERSON>Assemblyman Tom Mays</PERSON>, <LOCATION>R-Huntington Beach</LOCATION>, an avid surfer.;   "It's generated a
whole new business -- surfing-related sportswear companies," he said. "And
it's generated a lot of tourist dollars over the years.";   The museum
highlights surfing's contributions, <PERSON>Mays</PERSON> added. "It shows people in the area
how surfing has affected us," he said.;   As visitors walk into the museum,
they are greeted by volunteer docents. The first exhibit is the <ORGANIZATION>International
Surfing Hall of Fame</ORGANIZATION>, which describes surfing legends and their contributions
to the sport. Included is Hawaiian surfer <PERSON>Duke Kahanamoku</PERSON>, who tamed the waves
of <LOCATION>Oahu</LOCATION>'s northern shores and formed the island's first hui nalu, or surf
club, in <DATE>1907</DATE>. He helped popularize the sport in the <DATE>1920s</DATE> and was dubbed the
father of surfing. A bust of <ORGANIZATION>Kahanamoku</ORGANIZATION> was moved to the museum last year from
its longtime perch at the base of the <LOCATION>Huntington Beach pier.</LOCATION>;    Belly boards;
A few steps away is the museum's main attraction -- the surfboard exhibit. The
boards are lined up chronologically, by decades, spanning from <DATE>1900</DATE> to 1960.; 
 The oldest is a turn-of-the-century wooden belly board, or body board, from
<LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>. Surfers would ride the waves while lying flat on the boards, which
measure less than three feet in length. They were developed in the <DATE>1840s</DATE>,
after <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>'s King Kamehameha I decreed that only priests and royalty could
surf standing up -- to be closer to God.;   Toward the end of the century, the
edict was no longer enforced, and surfing enthusiasts started making longer
boards again.;   The surfboard exhibit includes a <DATE>1930</DATE> wooden model that
weighs 135 pounds and measures more than 12 1/2 feet. There also are several
of the original polyurethane boards, which were introduced in <DATE>1957</DATE> as a
lighter alternative to the bulky, wooden standards. Many of today's
polyurethane boards weigh less than 30 pounds and measure less than five
feet.;    Beach Boys music; Surfing posters, artwork and historic photos --
including a shot of <PERSON>Faye Baird</PERSON>, credited as the first female surfer --
decorate the walls. Baird is pictured getting ready to catch a wave off
Mission Beach on New Year's Eve 1927.;   <PERSON>Baird</PERSON> challenged the waves in a
woolen, one-piece bathing suit. Her midnight run was lighted by flares held by
other surfers, <PERSON>Beasley</PERSON> said. Now in her 80s, <PERSON>Baird</PERSON> lives in <LOCATION>San Diego.</LOCATION>;  
Surfing music blares from speakers near the museum's record collection, which
features the album covers of such greats as the Beach Boys, Jan and Dean and
the Safaris.;   Memorabilia from <LOCATION>Huntington Beach</LOCATION>'s Surf Theater, which
operated from the <DATE>1960s to 1987</DATE> and featured only surfing movies, is housed in
a corner of the museum called "Any Way to the Beach." Surfing clothes and
jewelry are displayed in the same section.;   There is a <DATE>1940s</DATE> Hawaiian shirt,
adorned with silk-screened prints of ukuleles, leis and breaking waves.
According to surfing legend, the person who wore the wildest Hawaiian shirt on
a surfing outing was dubbed king or queen for the day.;   Nearby are examples
of other clothing popularized by surfers, including the long shorts known as
jams and huarache sandals -- made in <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> using leather straps and portions
of rubber tires for soles.;   Jewelry from the <DATE>1950s</DATE> includes necklaces made
of small, carved dolphins, shark's teeth and tikis -- ornamental Polynesian
gods.;   Other highlights include a small library of surfing books, a gift
shop, a photographic tribute to woodies -- the old wood-paneled station wagons
favored by surfers -- and an exhibit dedicated to the heroes of lifesaving.;

<DATELINE> Nashville, Tenn.  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Looking like a huge converted barn, the <ORGANIZATION>Country Music Hall of Fame</ORGANIZATION> and Museum dominates the hill at the start of <LOCATION>Nashville</LOCATION>'s Music Row. 
To tourists, it's the shrine housing <ORGANIZATION>Elvis Presley</ORGANIZATION>'s "solid gold Cadillac." 
But to the music world, this barn and its parent <ORGANIZATION>Country Music Foundation</ORGANIZATION> are a mecca in the astonishing resurgence of this basic American art form. 

   The <ORGANIZATION>CMF</ORGANIZATION>, with its splendid collection of more than 100,000 records and extensive research library, is working hard to give country music the intellectual and historical foundation it sorely needs and deserves. 
"We're trying to show the breadth and depth of country music," says <ORGANIZATION>CMF</ORGANIZATION> director <PERSON>William Ivey</PERSON>. 
This mission takes a split personality. 
Its museum and gift shop cater to 400,000 country fans each year, who sandwich their visits between tourist stops like <LOCATION>Twitty City</LOCATION>, Cars of the Stars and the Opryland theme park. 
But the foundation also reaches a growing "downstairs audience," of scholars, music writers and performers who frequent its glass-enclosed underground reading room. 

   In both respects, the fully accredited <ORGANIZATION>CMF</ORGANIZATION> is the leading American museum devoted to popular music. 
Planners for the much publicized Rock and <PERSON>Roll Hall</PERSON> of Fame in <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION> have made several visits to study its operations. 

   The <ORGANIZATION>CMF</ORGANIZATION>'s more serious side is largely the work of <PERSON>Bill Ivey</PERSON>, who is prematurely white-haired at the age of 43. 
<PERSON>Mr. Ivey</PERSON> joined the foundation 17 years ago, just four years after the museum opened. 
An A.B.D. (All But Dissertation) from <ORGANIZATION>Indiana University</ORGANIZATION>'s folklore center, he was quickly named <ORGANIZATION>CMF</ORGANIZATION> director and ever since has been proselytizing not only the public, but recording company executives and country music stars. 

   One of his leading acolytes is the popular singer <PERSON>Emmylou Harris</PERSON>, who currently holds the honorific title of <ORGANIZATION>CMF</ORGANIZATION> president. 
Her involvement with the <ORGANIZATION>CMF</ORGANIZATION> dates to her first big hit, a <DATE>1975</DATE> cover of the <ORGANIZATION>Louvin Brothers</ORGANIZATION>' classic "If I Could Only Win Your Love." 
After that recording, she recalls, <PERSON>Mr. Ivey</PERSON> approached her with a compilation of hard-to-get material by the <LOCATION>Louvins</LOCATION>, one of the leading country duets of the late <DATE>1950s</DATE>. 
She gratefully recorded several more of their hits, she performed live with the surviving brother, <PERSON>Charlie Louvin</PERSON>, and she joined the <ORGANIZATION>CMF</ORGANIZATION> board. 

   Other stars have used the library and record collection one floor below the museum exhibits, the <PERSON>Hall</PERSON> of Fame gallery and the gift shop. 
<PERSON>Nanci Griffith</PERSON>, the "folkabilly" singer-songwriter from <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, has riden her bicycle over to look up songs half-remembered from her childhood. 
The eccentric and extremely gifted k.d. lang has consulted the <ORGANIZATION>CMF</ORGANIZATION>'s holdings on her hero (and according to some rumors her putative past life), the great <PERSON>Patsy Cline</PERSON>. 
<PERSON>Merle Haggard</PERSON> has been visiting since the mid-<DATE>'70s</DATE>, and actor <PERSON>Robert Duvall</PERSON> used <ORGANIZATION>CMF</ORGANIZATION> tapes to prepare for his role in the movie "Tender Mercies." 
The former teenage heartthrob <PERSON>Brenda Lee</PERSON> has served on the <ORGANIZATION>CMF</ORGANIZATION> board of trustees, along with <PERSON>Ms. Harris</PERSON> and leading industry executives. 

   The <ORGANIZATION>CMF</ORGANIZATION> also cultivates the record companies. 
A group of record producers and <LOCATION>Nashville</LOCATION> division heads from labels such as <ORGANIZATION>Warner Bros.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>MCA</ORGANIZATION> have met regularly at the museum for lunch and talks with industry veterans such as <PERSON>Chet Atkins</PERSON>. 
"We're trying to create a sense of continuity," says <PERSON>Mr. Ivey</PERSON>. 
The exposure to the past has worked both ways. 
Companies have given the <ORGANIZATION>CMF</ORGANIZATION> access to their own archives and occasionally made valuable donations. 
A few years ago, for instance, Opryland bought a downtown <LOCATION>Nashville</LOCATION> print shop that specialized in concert posters and gave the <ORGANIZATION>CMF</ORGANIZATION> a 10-year lease on its contents. 
The shop turned out to be a treasure trove of wood-block folk art and concert documentation going back to the turn of the century. 

   But the greatest triumph of this collaboration, and possibly of the <ORGANIZATION>CMF</ORGANIZATION>'s career, was the release last year of a two-record set called "The Bristol Sessions." 
The sixth issue from the foundation's own 2 1/2-year-old label, this set is nothing less than a cross-section of American traditional music at the dawn of commercial country music. 
In late <DATE>July</DATE> and <DATE>August of 1927</DATE>, <PERSON>Ralph Peer</PERSON>, an executive of <ORGANIZATION>Victor Talking Machine Co.</ORGANIZATION>, set up a field studio in <LOCATION>Bristol</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Tenn.</LOCATION>, the urban center for the middle Appalachians. 
In just three days of this talent search, Peer discovered some of the greatest names in country music history, including <PERSON>Jimmy Rodgers</PERSON> (the "blue yodeler") and the <PERSON>Carter</PERSON> Family. 
The <ORGANIZATION>CMF</ORGANIZATION> culled selections from Peer's 76 recordings, using acetates from the archives of RCA -- <PERSON>Victor</PERSON>, the corporate successor of <ORGANIZATION>Peer</ORGANIZATION>'s employers. 
RCA's help was "absolutely essential," says <ORGANIZATION>CMF</ORGANIZATION> assistant director <PERSON>Kyle Young</PERSON>. 

   Critics have praised "The Bristol Sessions" for its technical excellence. (The set received two Grammy nominations last year, in the categories of "Best Historical Album" and "Best Album Notes.") 
But the records also are surprisingly enjoyable, and they explode a few preconceptions. 
Even though Peer kept asking the performers for "old-time" songs, a broad range of influences kept creeping in. 
One of the "hillbilly" musicians showed up with a ukulele. 
Protest singers mingled with the gospel groups and mountain fiddlers. 
Songs by one of the new talents, Blind <PERSON>Alfred Reed</PERSON>, were still being covered by folk singers in the '70s. 

   The most surprising entry of all was the song "Single Girl, Married Girl" that the <PERSON>Carter</PERSON> women, <PERSON>Sara</PERSON> and cousin <PERSON>Maybelle</PERSON>, chose to cap their session. 
Backed by <PERSON>Maybelle</PERSON>'s marvelous guitar, it features lyrics like "Single girl, single girl, she goes to the store and buys; married girl, married girl, she rocks the cradle and cries," beginning a streak of feminist protest in country music that is about a mile wide. 

   The <ORGANIZATION>CMF</ORGANIZATION> doesn't limit itself to "oldtime" music. 
It has issued previously unreleased material from <PERSON>Hank Williams Sr.</PERSON> and the <LOCATION>Louvin Brothers</LOCATION> and is about to come out with a record of <PERSON>Buck Owens</PERSON>'s famous <DATE>1966</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>Carnegie Hall</ORGANIZATION> concert. 
It conducts oral history interviews with industry veterans, and three times a year it prints the Journal of Country Music, a handsome blend of photography, current profiles and scholarship. 
<PERSON>Ms. Harris</PERSON> says the <ORGANIZATION>CMF</ORGANIZATION>'s scope is "American music, really, not just country. 
It takes in gospel, hillbilly, cajun -- all kinds of ethnic music, some of it popular, some of it waiting to be discovered." 

   Much of this activity isn't immediately evident to the visitors who pay a <MONEY>$6.50</MONEY> entrance fee to wander among cases of costumes worn by stars from <PERSON>Hank Williams</PERSON> to <PERSON>Reba McEntire</PERSON>, to see <PERSON>Burt Reynolds</PERSON>'s Trans-Am from "Smokey and the Bandit" and to pluck the hands-on instrument displays. 
The museum sees itself as "market-driven," supporting its scholarship by responding to popular tastes in its exhibits. 
This strategy puts the museum in the black on a <MONEY>$3.3 million</MONEY> budget. (Even "The Bristol Sessions" set turned a profit.) 
It also produces occasional major exhibits blending solid history and mass appeal, such as the newly opened survey of <PERSON>Johnny Cash</PERSON>, who married <PERSON>Maybelle Carter</PERSON>'s daughter, <PERSON>June Carter Cash</PERSON>. 

   The <ORGANIZATION>CMF</ORGANIZATION> staff not only tolerates the hokier side of country music, it sometimes revels in it. 
A former director of its <ORGANIZATION>Oral History Project</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Douglas Green</PERSON>, left to join the comedy and western music group Riders in the Sky under the name <PERSON>Ranger Doug</PERSON>, "the idol of American youth." 
Another alumnus, <PERSON>Robert K. Oermann</PERSON>, is popular music reporter for the <ORGANIZATION>Nashville Tennessean</ORGANIZATION>. 
The <ORGANIZATION>CMF</ORGANIZATION> staff fondly remembers some of the donations <PERSON>Mr. Ivey</PERSON> has tactfully turned down, notably <PERSON>Porter Waggoner</PERSON>'s "Fish-tar," a guitar-shaped board on which the singer and avid fisherman had mounted a dozen or so of his prize catches. 

   But the final word came from the museum's <DATE>summer</DATE> interns one day when the senior staff was away at a conference. 
After raiding a local supermarket and applying gilt paint, the interns set up a display near the Presley Cadillac of, what else, <ORGANIZATION>Elvis</ORGANIZATION>'s "solid gold shopping cart."

FINDING THE BEST OF OLD, NEW ON THE BIG ISLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB O'SULLIVAN, O'Sullivan is a travel writer based in Canoga Park. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We just got back from our first visit to <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>. All we had known about those 
islands before we went was what we'd read and a few things we'd heard from 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
One of them, talking about <LOCATION>Waikiki</LOCATION>, said, "Nobody goes there any more because 
it's too crowded." 
</P>
<P>
Worse, others said that the <LOCATION>Old Hawaii</LOCATION> was "fading fast and that the old ways 
would soon be gone." 
</P>
<P>
Our first three days were at <LOCATION>Waikiki</LOCATION>. The palms; the trade winds; the scent of 
plumeria and dozens of other flowers, a sea with hundreds of greens and blues. 
We loved it all. That <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION> was intact. 
</P>
<P>
But the other complaint, that <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION> "was slipping further and further from the 
old ways," was a little harder to deal with or even define. 
</P>
<P>
On our fourth day we flew to the <LOCATION>Big Island</LOCATION>. We were going for a continuation 
of our vacation, but because some of the experts had said that the first 
settlers had gone to the <LOCATION>Big Island</LOCATION> first, it seemed a likelier place to look 
for answers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Biggest Island 
</P>
<P>
The state of <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION> is the whole archipelago. But the southernmost island of 
<LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>, the "<LOCATION>Big Island</LOCATION>," is the largest of the group. It is also, at a million 
years, so young that it's still under "construction." 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Mauna Kea</ORGANIZATION>, one of its two volcanoes, is in eruption. Its lava, flowing across 
the land and into the sea, makes the island a little bigger each day. Evidence 
of earlier eruptions is everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>Kona Airport</LOCATION> is on part of an 1801 lava flow. For the entire 25-mile drive 
north from the airport to our first hotel, the <LOCATION>Mauna Lani Bay</LOCATION>, the road was 
over uninterrupted lava beds. 
</P>
<P>
At a small sign saying <LOCATION>Mauna Lani Bay</LOCATION>, we turned off the highway. Suddenly, we 
weren't driving through the shiny black flow-lava anymore. We were in a green 
belt of golf courses and trees, then lush vegetation. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel and its grounds were startling. Just past the reception area was an 
atrium, a half-acre open to the sky, with growing flowers, shrubs, trees 
reaching up six floors, birds and even a lagoon and waterfalls. 
</P>
<P>
For the next three days, though, we both felt some mistake had been made, that 
we were in Shangri-La rather than <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
We moved to our next hotel, the <LOCATION>Hyatt Regency Waikoloa</LOCATION>, a few miles farther up 
the road, simply because we'd heard so much about it. 
</P>
<P>
If the <PERSON>Mauna Lani</PERSON> had seemed a little out of place, the <ORGANIZATION>Hyatt Regency Waikoloa</ORGANIZATION> 
was another world entirely. It had 1,600 rooms, and you had the option of 
taking either a boat or a train to get to and from the main lobby. Management 
advised you to allow 15 minutes to make the trip. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't seem to bother <PERSON>Joyce</PERSON>, so I kept myself in check, figuring I could 
always wax indignant later. But what with the pools, lagoons, trade winds and 
flowers, after an hour or so I couldn't remember, to save my neck, what I had 
wanted to be indignant about. The <LOCATION>New Hawaii</LOCATION> wasn't so bad. 
</P>
<P>
Later, at dinner with other hotel guests, the subject of the Islands' past 
"slipping away" came up again. There was some debate as to just what that past 
was. 
</P>
<P>
Was it <PERSON>Don Ho</PERSON> and a rum drink? Was it ukuleles and hula girls? Or was it a 
people living on fish, poi, breadfruit and pineapple, waiting and never knowing 
what they were waiting for, unless it was for Pele to make her next move? 
</P>
<P>
One woman told me that if I was really looking for the Old <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION> I ought to be 
talking to an old Hawaiian, and she had just the right person in mind. 
</P>
<P>
"The man is 64 years old. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
"Incredible," I said. "People still get that old?" 
</P>
<P>
His name was <PERSON>Jimmy Tohara</PERSON> and he was the chief plumber at another hotel, the 
<ORGANIZATION>Mauna Kea</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Golf Courses and Gardens 
</P>
<P>
The next morning while <PERSON>Joyce</PERSON> had breakfast in bed, I drove to another oasis of 
golf courses and gardens, in the center of which was the <ORGANIZATION>Mauna Kea</ORGANIZATION>. It was 
magnificent. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Jimmy Tohara</PERSON> had a smile that filled his whole face. As we walked to a place 
where we could talk, I told him how impressed I was with his workplace. He 
seemed to take it personally. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, this is one of the oldest hotels on the <LOCATION>Kohala Coast</LOCATION>," <PERSON>Jimmy</PERSON> said. 
"I've worked here for 25 years and I still notice the beauty every day. 
Everything belongs -- art pieces, even the people. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of us have been here most of our lives, and our children come to work 
here, too. We get second-generation guests. When something gets this right, you 
don't want to change it." 
</P>
<P>
He led me into a dining room that was not serving and we sat down. Jimmy's 
reaction to my "old ways" question surprised me. 
</P>
<P>
"You want to know whether we're getting away from the old ways? I hope so. This 
is a land where, at one time, the penalty for letting your shadow fall on the 
pathway of the king was instant death. Where a child born with anything wrong, 
even a birthmark, was not allowed to live. Old ways?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Little Problem 
</P>
<P>
He raised his brows, took off his glasses and polished them. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think people even want the 'not-quite-so-old' ways." 
</P>
<P>
Jimmy told me about something that had happened 25 years before. When the hotel 
had been new there had been a little problem with the water. Though it was 
pure, on its way down from the snows on 13,000-foot <LOCATION>Mauna Loa</LOCATION> it tended to 
acquire the color of tea. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the guests called me," he said. "She said, 'Look at that water. It's 
brown. You can't expect me to bathe in that water, much less drink it.' " 
</P>
<P>
"There was nothing I could do. I acted like I was really offended. 'Lady,' I 
said, 'that water comes from the Goddess Pele. You have heard of King 
Kamehameha with his bodyguard so big and strong. Seven feet tall with muscles 
hard as teak. It's because all their lives they drink this water. No other 
water, this water.' 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Natural Springs 
</P>
<P>
At that point he poured himself a glass of water, drank it down, took a deep 
breath, stood up as straight as he could and left. "I was trying to grow before 
her eyes. It must have worked. I never heard from her again." 
</P>
<P>
He laughed at the memory. "Now we tap natural springs and the water is as clean 
and clear as the sky." 
</P>
<P>
"A long time ago I found a couple of steering sweeps, the big oars they put on 
canoes to steer with. I cleaned them up and put them on the wall. 
</P>
<P>
"When people asked me what they were, I told them they were blades from 
Hawaiian helicopters, that we had them here hundreds of years ago and that we 
didn't need engines because we always had the trade winds." 
</P>
<P>
Then I said, "You aren't above making up a legend yourself." 
</P>
<P>
"I would never do that," he said, trying to keep his face straight. "But that 
business about bad luck coming to people who take the lava rock from Pele's 
volcanoes for souvenirs . . . you know how that started? 
</P>
<P>
"I heard it was a bus driver who got tired of all the tourists bringing the 
dirty rocks onto his nice clean bus, so he made up the legend." 
</P>
<P>
"Jimmy," I asked, "would you take a lava souvenir from the volcano?" The 
question seemed to startle him. 
</P>
<P>
"You think I'm crazy?!" he said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
"But most of our legends can be explained," he said. "Hawaiian fishermen throw 
a bucket over the side, bring up water and drink it. Haoles (foreigners) try 
it, get sick and a legend is born. Hawaiians can drink sea water. Hawaiians are 
magic." 
</P>
<P>
"How do they do that?" I asked. He ignored the question. 
</P>
<P>
"Magic, I tell you, magic. A million years, maybe all our lava breaks down into 
soil, huh? The people who build these hotels don't want to wait; they crush the 
lava, bring in topsoil and fill it with plantings from all over the <LOCATION>Pacific 
Basin</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"And birds, do you think they would be here? These hotels brought in the birds. 
Now there are birds all over the <LOCATION>Kohala Coast</LOCATION>, and they take the seeds of our 
flowers all over the island. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of these hotels there is employment where there was none before and 
visitors can come from all over the world to enjoy <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>. I think maybe the 
new ways are worth considering too, huh? 
</P>
<P>
"Tomorrow night there will be a hukilau on the beach, at the <ORGANIZATION>Royal Waikoloan</ORGANIZATION>, a 
luau with fish instead of pork. You go and take your wife and you may see some 
of the best of the old ways." 
</P>
<P>
I was mad at myself for feeling any resentment about the big hotels' 
"intrusions." I had not considered how they figured in the island's economy and 
how their existence made advancement possible for so many people. 
</P>
<P>
Back at the hotel, the information was available. Since opening in <DATE>1988</DATE> the 
<LOCATION>Waikoloa</LOCATION> resort alone has pumped an estimated <MONEY>$50 million</MONEY> into <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>'s 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
<MONEY>$4,000</MONEY> a Day 
</P>
<P>
It spent <MONEY>$4,000</MONEY> a day on produce alone that it bought from farmers. It required 
so much staff that the hotel had to run daily buses to <LOCATION>Hilo</LOCATION>, on the other side 
of the island, to bring people to work and then take them home. 
</P>
<P>
Joyce and I went to the hukilau on the beach the next night. Young people in 
native costume danced against a background of the sea and a setting sun to the 
music of drums, ukuleles and the trade winds in the palms. 
</P>
<P>
When it got dark, torches were lighted and food was served. 
</P>
<P>
Toward the end of the evening I talked with one of the girls who had been 
dancing for us. I told her about how I'd been asking around about the <LOCATION>Old 
Hawaii</LOCATION> and of what I'd learned so far. 
</P>
<P>
I told her that it was probably good that the islands were changing, that the 
local people were getting a share of the prosperity. It might have been that I 
couldn't keep the disappointment out of my voice. 
</P>
<P>
She touched my arm. 
</P>
<P>
"No," she said, "don't feel that way. I know what you feel. I have children and 
I'm grateful that, thanks to the people who visit us, I'll be able to send them 
to college. But because we have gained something it doesn't mean we've lost 
anything. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all still here." 
</P>
<P>
She took my hands. 
</P>
<P>
"All my life my grandmother would take my hands, like this, and look into my 
eyes and say, 'Hold on, hold on.' I think it was the last thing she said to me 
before she died. 'Hold on.' 
</P>
<P>
"We have a word -- malama. It means 'stewardship,' a knowing and caring 
stewardship. My grandmother had taught me and my mother the old ways, as her 
mother had taught her. She was telling me to hold on to them, hold on to the 
traditions. Don't ever let them go. And I haven't, and neither will my children 
and their children. The old ways are here." 
</P>
<P>
I nodded toward the torch-lighted stage amid the palms. "Here?" 
</P>
<P>
"No." She touched the area over her heart. "Here."

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Roy Clark A Country Music Ambassador</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Country music performer <PERSON>Roy Clark</PERSON>, the
longtime star of the ``Hee Haw'' TV show, thinks the cornpone
program would be received well in the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> has made two concert tours of the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>, most
recently giving 12 performances last <DATE>November</DATE>. He previously made
18 concert appearances in <DATE>1976</DATE>.
   ``I'm sure they would be bewildered by the corny jokes, but the
overall image of `<PERSON>Hee Haw</PERSON>' would be compatible with their
entertainment,'' <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> said in an interview. ``They are interested
in the history of the American West such as the cowboys.
   ``You see audiences in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> in fringe and cowboy hats and the
Soviets are the same way. They would identify with that image of
`<PERSON>Hee Haw</PERSON>.' ''
   The 56-year-old <PERSON>Clark</PERSON>, who has been host of the show since it
first aired 21 years ago, foresees an entire wave of new viewers.
   ``There's a generation of young people who get together on
<DATE>Saturday</DATE> nights and use it as an excuse to have a party in the
(college) dorm,'' he said. ``It's gone around and made a complete
cycle. We may become another fad. I have a feeling it will outlast
me.''
   The program, which is seen on more than 200 stations, is taped
every <DATE>June</DATE> and <DATE>October</DATE>. <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> says the fact that it's not a
months-long process has contributed to the show's longevity.
   ``This keeps it fresh,'' he said by telephone from his office in
<LOCATION>Tulsa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Okla.</LOCATION> ``We're not around each other enough to get on each
other's nerves. It's a natural high energy for us to perform
because it's like starting over twice a year.''
   When <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> first appeared on the show, he already had been
performing on prime-time network TV variety shows. But he said
``Hee Haw'' capped his career.
   ``This was the icing on the cake,'' he said. ``This put my face
and name together.''
   His recent appearances in the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> have embellished his
role as one of country music's major ambassadors. After his first
tour there 13 years ago, which was made with the <ORGANIZATION>Oak Ridge Boys</ORGANIZATION>,
the <ORGANIZATION>Country Music Association</ORGANIZATION> gave him the title ``international
friendship ambassador.''
   He also performed in <LOCATION>Bulgaria</LOCATION> <DATE>last year</DATE> where his concert was
broadcast live and seen by more than 500 million people in
socialist countries.
   ``There's a special feeling when you play in a foreign
country,'' <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> said. ``It's not just another concert. There is a
lot of responsibility on your shoulders.
   ``You are representing your country first of all. Also you must
represent your music well. The opinions of your performance
reflects back on all the other country music performers. If the
people don't like it, they will think that's what all of country
music is like.
   ``Your adrenalin definitely flows a little faster.''
   His appearances were taped for television broadcast throughout
<ORGANIZATION>Eastern Bloc</ORGANIZATION> countries. Soviet officials told him his concerts
would be seen by 700 million people by the time they are broadcast
and rebroadcast several times.
   In the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, The <LOCATION>Nashville Network</LOCATION> on cable TV is
carrying two one-hour specials about <PERSON>Clark</PERSON>'s Soviet shows.
   <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> said such a huge audience is a bit intimidating.
   ``The first thing you think about is how many mistakes you
made,'' he said, chuckling. ``You wonder how many flat notes you
hit and whether you looked tired and were at your best.
   ``But it was gratifying. There's nothing like recognition.''
   He said the Soviet people were especially interested in the
banjo. Crowds would gather at the foot of the stage to get a close
look at his instruments, especially the banjo.
   ``You could tune one up and they would love it,'' <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> said.
``They know the history of it as an authentic American instrument.
They know it speaks of our heritage. And they like that brilliant
sound of the banjo.''
   <PERSON>Clark</PERSON>, a native of Meherrin, <LOCATION>Va.</LOCATION>, grew up in <LOCATION>Staten Island</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>St. Clairsville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>. His father was a
computer programmer for the federal government.
   He learned to play a homemade ukulele as a youngster and got his
first guitar at age 14. He is accomplished on the 12-string guitar,
acoustic guitar, banjo and fiddle and also plays five other
instruments.
   <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> has dabbled in acting, co-starring in the <DATE>1986</DATE> movie
``Uphill All the Way'' with <PERSON>Mel Tillis</PERSON>. He's also appeared in the
TV shows ``The Odd Couple'' and ``The Beverly Hillbillies.''
   He is now approaching 30 years as a performer, having celebrated
his 25th anniversary in <DATE>1985</DATE>, and his foreign concert tours are not
over. He plans to return to the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> within two years.
   ``I'd like to keep the friendship going,'' <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> said.

O.C. POP BEAT: JUDY COLLINS A PUZZLE BUT A GRAND ONE

<P>
To say that <PERSON>Judy Collins</PERSON> sends a mixed message would be an understatement. 
</P>
<P>
Her background is in the '60s folk boom, but <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> night she came on stage at 
the new <ORGANIZATION>Irvine Barclay Theatre</ORGANIZATION> in a shiny, silver-sequined jacket and black 
tights -- garb that virtually shouted "I am not a folkie!" 
</P>
<P>
But if <PERSON>Collins</PERSON>' look was almost ready for Vegas, her outlook was in large part 
a product of those olden folkie-hippie days. Her 80-minute set included hymns 
to love and peace, a misty recollection of <LOCATION>Woodstock</LOCATION>, a homage to <PERSON>John Lennon</PERSON> 
and, of course, "Both Sides Now," that <PERSON>Joni Mitchell-penned</PERSON> ode to the emerging 
youth culture's dizzy, dancing quest for self-realization. 
</P>
<P>
Toss in renditions of a <PERSON>Stephen Sondheim</PERSON> standard, an a cappella Irish ballad, 
up-to-the-minute adult contemporary pop stylings from <PERSON>Collins</PERSON>' new album and a 
smooth, friendly but unrevealing stage manner, and you've got . . . well, it's 
hard to say just what you've got. Pop cosmopolitanism, maybe. But whatever it 
was, it certainly sounded grand. 
</P>
<P>
If there were a 50-and-over circuit for singers like the one for pro golfers, 
<PERSON>Collins</PERSON> would make a killing. At 51, her voice sounds richer, bigger and more 
brilliant than it did on her '60s hits. Sometimes with the smoothness of a 
Cadillac transmission, sometimes with sudden surprise, <PERSON>Collins</PERSON> would ascend to 
her upper register and hold her notes with an assured vibrato. It wasn't a 
matter of grandstanding or straining for effect. Everything <PERSON>Collins</PERSON> sang came 
with a sense of proportion and exactness, and a focused attention to the 
meaning of what she sang. 
</P>
<P>
Supporting her was a four-member band that was sweet, clean and responsive, 
polished but not too slick. Pianist <PERSON>Joseph Joubert</PERSON> was the most valuable 
player, not just for his sensitive instrumental accompaniments but also for 
excellent, presence-filled background vocals. <PERSON>Zeb Katz</PERSON> provided firm, supple 
electric bass lines, similar to the style that's a foundation of <PERSON>Suzanne Vega</PERSON>'s 
sound. Electric guitarist <PERSON>Lou Volpe</PERSON> came up with varied, appropriate shadings 
in his understated solos. 
</P>
<P>
Collins opened strumming a 12-string guitar on "Chelsea Morning" and "Someday 
Soon," songs that found her in good voice but not quite emotionally engaged. 
That missing intensity quickly emerged on "Fires of <ORGANIZATION>Eden</ORGANIZATION>," the soft-rock title 
anthem from <PERSON>Collins</PERSON>' new album. Deservedly, it received a bigger cheer than the 
more familiar songs that began the show. 
</P>
<P>
From there, <PERSON>Collins</PERSON> mixed lovingly recreated oldies (including a slow, 
melancholy "In My Life," in honor of <PERSON>John Lennon</PERSON>'s birthday, and a sumptuous 
"Both Sides Now") with good, new songs. 
</P>
<P>
She turned "From a Distance," which <PERSON>Nanci Griffith</PERSON> has sung with wispy 
yearning, into a muscular yet not strident hymn, posing big questions about the 
possibility of world peace. <PERSON>Collins</PERSON>' "Fortune of Soldiers" was a darker but 
still richly melodic exploration of similar themes. 
</P>
<P>
"The Blizzard," a long narrative a la <PERSON>Harry Chapin</PERSON>, allowed <PERSON>Collins</PERSON> briefly to 
link her folk and art-song strands and provided a showcase for some of her 
finest singing. With rippling grand piano, played by <PERSON>Collins</PERSON>, and shivery, 
crystalline touches from the other musicians, the song took on a chilly 
instrumental hue that only served as a prelude for <PERSON>Collins</PERSON>' soaring affirmation 
at the end, when the blizzard lifts, and with it the protagonist's troubled 
emotional state. 
</P>
<P>
A gospel-tinged treatment of "Bird on a Wire" was a bit too polite -- one hoped 
for <PERSON>Collins</PERSON> to cut loose and get a little raw, knowing she wouldn't because 
control is the basis of her style. Her only real failure, though, was a song 
about the <LOCATION>Woodstock</LOCATION> festival that reminisced with hazy sentimentality about the 
old hippie gathering. Couplets like "Rain, rain go away, we're gonna save the 
world today" should be sung soaked in irony or, better yet, not sung at all. 
</P>
<P>
Still, it was nice to be able to sit in a comfortable, acoustically superior 
concert theater in <LOCATION>Orange County</LOCATION> and realize that <LOCATION>Woodstock</LOCATION> had some relevance 
for the star on stage. By booking <PERSON>Judy Collins</PERSON> for its second full concert -- 
and the first by a famous name -- the <LOCATION>Irvine Barclay</LOCATION> showed a willingness to 
embrace music of the rock era. With the exception of one night of <PERSON>Johnny Cash</PERSON>, 
that's something that the <ORGANIZATION>Orange County Performing Arts Center</ORGANIZATION> hasn't done in 
three years of operation. 
</P>
<P>
The <LOCATION>Irvine Barclay</LOCATION>'s 756-seat capacity makes it ideal for pop performers who 
aren't big enough to play the county's two outdoor concrete slabs and want to 
treat fans to something more formal and conducive to concentrated listening 
than a club full of cigarette smoke and clinking beer bottles. Jazz, folk, pop 
and the sort of rock that's meant to be heard from a sitting position all would 
go nicely at the <LOCATION>Irvine Barclay</LOCATION>, especially with the prospect of patronage from 
a student population close at hand. 
</P>
<P>
It will be interesting to see what the nonprofit theater's management comes up 
with to spice a primary diet of dance, theater and classical music. For now, 
it's encouraging to step into a theater that looks like a good place for <PERSON>Tom 
Waits</PERSON> or <PERSON>Ornette Coleman</PERSON> or Ry Cooder and <PERSON>David Lindley</PERSON> to play, and to realize 
that if they would be willing, so, most likely, would the management.

   Twenty years ago, <PERSON>Skip Ewing</PERSON> saw <PERSON>Glen
Campbell</PERSON> perform on television. Something clicked.
   At the time <PERSON>Ewing</PERSON> was about to start school. Today, he's 26 and
one of the youngest country music performers signed to a recording
contract with a major label.
   ``I was about 4 when I got my first guitar,'' <PERSON>Ewing</PERSON> recalled in
an interview. ``I can't remember a time when I didn't play.
   ``I know I sang the theme to `Rawhide' and I watched `The <ORGANIZATION>Glen
Campbell Goodtime Hour</ORGANIZATION>.' I wanted to play just like Glen.''
   In the <DATE>1990s</DATE>, <PERSON>Ewing</PERSON> is one of country music's fresh faces, just
as <ORGANIZATION>Campbell</ORGANIZATION> was in the late '60s.
   The handsome, well-spoken singer-songwriter is laying the
foundation for a solid career doing something he genuinely enjoys.
   His single, ``It's You Again,'' reached the Top 10 of the
country music popularity charts in <DATE>February</DATE>. ``Burnin' a Hole in My
Heart'' and ``The Gospel According to Luke'' were Top 10 hits last
year.
   Ewing has released two albums, ``Coast of <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION>'' and ``The
Will to Love.'' The latter has many cuts with little more than a
finger-picked acoustic guitar.
   He was born in <LOCATION>Redlands</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, but lived throughout the
country because his father spent 11 years moving from city to city
in the <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION>. Ewing worked at the <ORGANIZATION>Opryland USA</ORGANIZATION> theme park in
<LOCATION>Nashville</LOCATION> for 2{ seasons as a singer-dancer in a live production
tracing the history of country music.
   He also made a living as a songwriter and has written album cuts
recorded by <PERSON>Kenny Rogers</PERSON>, <PERSON>Willie Nelson</PERSON>, <PERSON>George Strait</PERSON>, <PERSON>George
Jones</PERSON>, <PERSON>Conway Twitty</PERSON>, <PERSON>Ricky Van Shelton</PERSON> and others.
   Since launching his solo career, he has been the opening act at
country concerts with such headline performers as the <LOCATION>Judds</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Randy
Travis</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Reba McEntire</ORGANIZATION>.
   Ewing, who also plays the five-string banjo and mandolin,
understands that he's fortunate to have a recording contract at a
relatively youthful age. But he quickly adds that he worked
diligently for it.
   ``I was in town three years before it happened,'' he said. ``It
was a short time compared with some people, but I had been doing it
for a heck of a long time. I had been singing and writing songs and
traveling.
   ``I'm not a very patient person sometimes; I want things to
happen. That's one of the things I need to work on: accept things
as they are.
   ``I set awful big goals; I work hard at what I do,'' he said.
``I figured there are a lot of singers in town, a lot of
songwriters and a lot of guitar players, and if I can do all of
them well I have a chance.''
   His ballad-oriented music focuses on romance. In the album ``The
Will to Love,'' the song ``It's You Again'' is about the pain of
love. The cut ``Karen'' is about the disintegration of a
relationship. ``She's <PERSON>Makin</PERSON>' Plans'' is about devotion. ``Please
Don't Leave Me Now'' deals with family love.
   ``It seems like my voice is suited to ballads,'' <PERSON>Ewing</PERSON> said. ``I
like to sing emotional things. I feel like I'm sharing something
when I do that. I enjoy singing things that allow me to feel like
I'm saying something, that I'm expressing something. It's like
being an actor sometimes.''
   He has written all the songs he has recorded.
   ``Songwriting is very much a craft and an art. I don't just
settle for things. Sometimes it takes hours to find one line _ a
place where different emotions mix.
   ``I feel like I have a lot to offer. When I go and do a show,
it's not a job. It's something I love to do. The music I perform
and write is all a part of me. By sharing that with an audience, I
feel I'm sharing things important to me. I feel that what I share
with people is worthwhile and I'm not wasting somebody's time with
my music.''
   The song ``The Will to Love'' used an instrument rarely used in
country music: a cello. Ewing, who didn't want to use traditional
country instruments such as fiddles and steel guitars, said it
allowed him to be more intimate.
   On his next <ORGANIZATION>LP</ORGANIZATION>, he plans to use another instrument rarely heard
in country music _ a saxophone.
   ``I don't mind taking chances,'' <PERSON>Ewing</PERSON> said.
   <ORGANIZATION>Campbell</ORGANIZATION>, his old idol, surprised him recently after hearing
that <PERSON>Ewing</PERSON> was a longtime fan of his. ``He came by the studio
during my first album just to say `Hi!' That was a big deal to me
and still is.''

INSTRUMENTS: BENITO HUIPE TAKES MONTHS TO CREATE MASTERPIECES THAT ARE PLAYED 
BY CONCERT AND FLAMENCO ARTISTS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN RIVERA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The walls of <PERSON>Benito Huipe</PERSON>'s workshop on <LOCATION>Washington Boulevard</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Culver City</LOCATION> are 
covered with his handiwork. Guitars, in various stages of construction, hang by 
pegs. Each is made of the finest wood available, gathered from four continents. 
</P>
<P>
The guitars' sides and backs, a deep reddish-brown hue, are made of rosewood 
from <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> or <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>. The soundboard, or front, is hard German spruce. The long 
neck is made of mahogany from <LOCATION>Honduras</LOCATION>, and the black fingerboard is fashioned 
from ebony from <LOCATION>Madagascar</LOCATION>. Each instrument emanates a woody scent that comes 
from the inner bracing made from Spanish cedar. 
</P>
<P>
Huipe, 43, is one of a handful of craftsmen in <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION> who make 
fine guitars by hand. 
</P>
<P>
His work has attracted the attention of numerous concert artists and flamenco 
guitarists throughout the country who now play his guitars. 
</P>
<P>
Huipe started making guitars in his hometown of <LOCATION>Paracho</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Michoacan</LOCATION>, a small 
village in the highlands west of <LOCATION>Mexico City</LOCATION>. His first job was in the workshop 
of his father's friend, <PERSON>Luis Vargas</PERSON>, where he began by putting strings and 
tuning pegs on guitars. 
</P>
<P>
"And then I started making my own guitars, small ones, you know, like 
ukuleles," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He learned the finer points of instrument-making from his brother, <PERSON>Miguel</PERSON>, who 
is an expert violin bow craftsman. Miguel went to a school in <LOCATION>Mexico City</LOCATION> where 
he learned the basics of instrument craftsmanship. He then passed on his 
knowledge to his brother, <PERSON>Benito</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
"He taught me to understand the difference in sound between a classical guitar 
and a flamenco guitar, <PERSON>Huipe</PERSON> said. He told me, 'Benito, with flamenco guitars 
the strings have to be very close to the soundboard so that the sound of the 
strings blends with the sound of the wood, like a drum, very dry, very dry, 
like a flamenco dancer, very harsh. And with a classical guitar, the strings 
have to be very separated from the soundboard, so it will sound very clear, 
very sustained.' " 
</P>
<P>
He also learned by carefully examining the work of other guitar makers. When he 
arrived in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> more than 20 years ago, he got a job at the <ORGANIZATION>Valdez 
Guitar Shop</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>West Hollywood</LOCATION>, where he repaired guitars built by some of the 
best craftspeople in the world. When he repaired a guitar, he would study its 
construction closely. 
</P>
<P>
"I took ideas from all the instruments I repaired," he said. 
</P>
<P>
After five years of repairing other people's guitars, he struck out on his own, 
setting up a workshop in his garage. He took the instruments he made there to 
restaurants that featured flamenco music to display his wares to guitarists and 
eventually attracted several faithful customers. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Phil Boroff</PERSON>, a professional guitarist and recording artist who owns three of 
Huipe's guitars, said <PERSON>Huipe</PERSON>'s guitars "have an emotional quality, a 
personality." Although most guitars used by professional artists are 
technically well made, he said, they often sound "unromantic." Huipe's guitars, 
however, "are in essence very romantic, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Each guitar has a psyche. They are all really extremely beautiful," he added. 
</P>
<P>
And each Huipe guitar <PERSON>Boroff</PERSON> hears is better than the last, he said. "It's like 
he's hit a high point, and he keeps edging up." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Mike Hoover</PERSON>, manager of <ORGANIZATION>McCabe</ORGANIZATION>'s Guitar Shop in <LOCATION>Santa Monica</LOCATION>, has witnessed the 
improvements in <LOCATION>Huipe</LOCATION>'s instruments. 
</P>
<P>
Hoover recalled that when Huipe first brought his guitars to the shop to sell, 
"they were very nice-sounding, but they were crude." Under <PERSON>Hoover</PERSON>'s guidance, 
<PERSON>Huipe</PERSON> was able to correct certain imperfections in his craftsmanship. 
</P>
<P>
"He would take my critique very well," <PERSON>Hoover</PERSON> said. "I've seen him come a long 
way." 
</P>
<P>
Huipe continued to work in his garage workshop for 15 years until his landlord 
evicted him. "He said it's (for a garage), not for a shop," <PERSON>Huipe</PERSON> said. "And he 
pushed me to open my own business." 
</P>
<P>
He opened his shop <DATE>Jan. 1, 1989</DATE>. There's not much to it: a handmade sign 
outside that says, "Benito Huipe, Handmade Guitars," a front room with a bare 
cement floor, a double rack of guitars in various stages of construction on one 
side, and others hung on the back wall. 
</P>
<P>
Flamenco music from a small, yellow cassette player fills the shop. Huipe 
always listens to flamenco or classical guitar music, much of it played on his 
own instruments, as he works. 
</P>
<P>
There is one metal folding chair, where Huipe sits as he holds a guitar and 
sands it, or rubs on shellac in a circular motion, a technique called French 
polishing. Hoover notes that this technique of hand-applying the finish gives 
the guitar a better sound, but makes it less desirable to many American 
consumers, who prefer a high-gloss sprayed finish. 
</P>
<P>
It takes Huipe approximately 80 hours to make a single guitar. He spreads the 
time over three or four months, working on several guitars at the same time, in 
order to give the glue and the eight coats of shellac time to dry between 
applications. 
</P>
<P>
His guitars sell for between <MONEY>$2,500</MONEY> and <MONEY>$3,000</MONEY>, quite inexpensive in comparison 
to other hand-made guitars, which can cost up to <MONEY>$6,000</MONEY> to <MONEY>$7,000</MONEY>. 
</P>
<P>
Most of Huipe's customers are musicians who are familiar with his work. 
</P>
<P>
"The customers who buy my guitars, they know my guitars. They saw some concert 
artist playing my guitar, and they call me and they make an appointment, and I 
make the guitar." 
</P>
<P>
His business has yet to become a full-time pursuit, however. He must still 
support himself by working as a waiter for banquets at the <ORGANIZATION>Beverly Regent 
Wilshire Hotel</ORGANIZATION>. The banquet schedule suits him, he says, because he can work at 
his shop during the day and wait tables at night. 
</P>
<P>
"It's convenient. And also, the hotel gives me a chance to buy better wood. I 
make money there, and then I buy nice wood, the best wood," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He has a lot of orders for guitars these days, and thinks he will stay at the 
hotel for only one more year. He has a backlog of orders and a finished guitar 
doesn't stay in his shop long. 
</P>
<P>
Beautiful as his guitars are, Huipe doesn't feel comfortable with the title of 
artist. "I'm not really an artist. It makes me feel fancy when you say that," 
he said.

EVERYONE WINS AT THE JIM HALL INVITATIONAL

This is the time for that annual nine-day wonder known as the <ORGANIZATION>JVC Jazz 
Festival</ORGANIZATION>. It is a time when critics moan about the use of non-jazz acts while 
producer <PERSON>George Wein</PERSON> groans about the shortage of young musicians and the 
difficulty of attracting audiences. It is also a time when the public proves 
them all wrong, by crowding into concert halls to salute artists of all ages. 
Nowhere was this more evident than at the <PERSON>Jim Hall Invitational</PERSON> <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> at <ORGANIZATION>Town 
Hall</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Hall</PERSON>, 59, has long been respected for his guitar mastery and lack of 
exhibitionism. The host, <PERSON>Pat Metheny</PERSON>, observed that <PERSON>Hall</PERSON>'s influence has 
extended even to those who have gone on to develop radically different styles. 
</P>
<P>
The evening presented him in a dozen settings, from impeccably executed duos 
(with bassist <PERSON>Ron Carter</PERSON>, saxophonist <PERSON>Gerry Mulligan</PERSON> and valve trombonist <PERSON>Bob 
Brookmeyer</PERSON>) to a semi-classical ensemble that included a string quartet. His 
assurance that he had a "non-proliferation" treaty with the other guitarist, to 
avoid excessive volume, was faithfully remembered by all hands. 
</P>
<P>
Hall ventured from shallow waters (a cheerful ukulele-like strumming on "St. 
Thomas" with <PERSON>Ron Carter</PERSON>) to deep experimentation, in an acerbic and atonal 
work, untitled, written 35 years ago when he was a student. The latter was one 
of three numbers with the <ORGANIZATION>Classical Heritage</ORGANIZATION> string ensemble, which also 
performed a rather turgid piece, "Abstract and Dreams," with composer <PERSON>Don 
Thompson</PERSON> at the piano, as well as a fascinating item called "Laura's Dream" 
that teamed <PERSON>Hall</PERSON> with the four mallets of vibist <PERSON>Gary Burton</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
Written by <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Astor Piazzola</LOCATION>, this was the climactic closer of the 
first half. 
</P>
<P>
Later, <PERSON>Hall</PERSON> worked mainly in tandem with other guitarists, two of whom spurred 
him on to some of his most creative moments. <PERSON>John Scofield</PERSON>, in a 180-degree 
switch from funk back to jazz, drew spirited and aggressive mainstream sounds 
from a solid-body guitar and had Hall responding in time. On a more restrained 
level, <PERSON>Pat Metheny</PERSON> proved to be a soulmate for <PERSON>Hall</PERSON> as he brought a keening, 
mournful air to the Brazilian standard "How Insensitive" before the pair burst 
into a hard-driving series of exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
Hall's regular quartet was weakened by the unswinging piano of <PERSON>Gil Goldstein</PERSON> 
and the mood-shattering drum interlude by <PERSON>Terry Clarke</PERSON>. He seemed more at home 
trading choruses with his promising 20-year-old guitar student, <PERSON>Peter 
Bernstein</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
For his finale, <PERSON>Hall</PERSON> fielded a 10-man band that included guitarists <PERSON>Bernstein</PERSON>, 
<PERSON>John Abercrombie</PERSON>, <PERSON>Mick Goodrick</PERSON> (playing a headless and almost bodyless guitar) 
and <PERSON>Scofield</PERSON>. To his credit, instead of jamming on a conventional blues they 
played a <PERSON>Hall</PERSON> composition, "Careful." The title seemed especially fitting for 
an evening that had clearly been planned with loving care.

A handsome, middle-aged couple are sitting in a meeting hall, pontificating

<PERSON>Marcella Lowe</PERSON> with a grin. <PERSON>Warren Lowe</PERSON>, 60, a <ORGANIZATION>Customs Service</ORGANIZATION> inspector, made 
his contra debut the previous month and sounded as if he was on his way to 
becoming a contra convert. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to dance the <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> reel to this sort of music back in 
<LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION>," he said, gesturing toward the stage, where a band was playing a 
furious fiddle tune. "It's easy to pick up on these dances after you do them a 
few times." 
</P>
<P>
She seemed eager to hit the dance floor: "This music has a different beat from 
square-dancing music. We used to call this 'stompy music' -- the stuff you like 
to pat your feet to." 
</P>
<P>
Contra dancing, according to <PERSON>Richard Nevell</PERSON>'s book "A Time to Dance," is a 
distant cousin of <PERSON>Morris</PERSON> dancing, an ancient ceremonial activity performed by 
men in <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> to encourage fruitful crops. As the dance evolved, it became 
more of a social function involving both sexes. 
</P>
<P>
Early settlers of <LOCATION>New England</LOCATION> brought the dances with them to this continent. 
By the late <ORGANIZATION>18th Century</ORGANIZATION>, the French, a dominant force in dance at the time, 
renamed this "country dancing" contredanse, which English-speakers later 
adapted to "contra." 
</P>
<P>
The term also refers to the position of dancing opposite a partner. Instead of 
dancers interacting in groups of eight, as is common in square dancing, contra 
dancers line people up in two long rows. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Carolyn Russell</PERSON> is the main organizer of these <LOCATION>Anaheim</LOCATION> dances. Long before any 
happy-footed folk show up to test the floor, <PERSON>Russell</PERSON> stands in the middle of 
the small hall, checking the sound system for the Occasional String Band 
quintet, in which she plays guitar, bass and, sometimes, French accordion. The 
56-year-old <ORGANIZATION>Garden Grove</ORGANIZATION> resident cuts a casual figure in wheat-colored slacks, 
black blouse and Birkenstock sandals as she shouts directions over the music to 
adjust the level of various instruments and microphones. Once satisfied with 
the sonic levels, <PERSON>Russell</PERSON> took a break in a quiet back room and talked about 
exactly what makes these dances worth the effort it takes to set them up and 
keep them running. 
</P>
<P>
"I was born on a farm in <LOCATION>North Dakota</LOCATION> and was raised around old-time music. As 
a 5-year-old, I was taken to some of the last authentic country dances in the 
area," she explained, speaking softly now that she didn't have to shout over 
amplified music. 
</P>
<P>
"Those dances were held in school auditoriums, with benches all around the 
sides and lots of coats and overshoes and grandmas and little kids. A fiddler 
came down from <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>, usually." 
</P>
<P>
Russell's fascination with music began at a tender age. She got a ukulele when 
she was 6, a guitar for <DATE>Christmas</DATE> when she was 10 and picked up other 
instruments from there. Now, she is such a music aficionado that she also plays 
guitar in the <LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION> Cajun Trio and a zydeco band. 
</P>
<P>
She has been plucking tunes with Occasional String Band-mates <PERSON>Carty Wilson</PERSON> and 
<PERSON>Hugh Nestor</PERSON> since the late '70s. 
</P>
<P>
"We had been gathering to play music in living rooms forever, it seemed," 
<PERSON>Russell</PERSON> said. "Out of that group of people playing together, the idea of having 
dancing developed. My husband and I had a covered, sheltered patio in our yard 
in <LOCATION>Garden Grove</LOCATION>, and put on a dance there for five years, until <DATE>1987</DATE>." 
</P>
<P>
That's when city officials put a halt to the informal gatherings because 
<PERSON>Russell</PERSON> did not have an entertainment permit. 
</P>
<P>
Once the band decided that the dancers and the musicians deserved "to build a 
good dance, as opposed to a fun thing that ultimately wouldn't go anywhere," 
<PERSON>Russell</PERSON> said, they moved the contra first to <LOCATION>Huntington Beach</LOCATION>, then in late 
<DATE>1988</DATE> to its current location. A labor of love more than a moneymaking venture, 
this monthly contra draws 30 to 50 dancers per night -- just enough, at <MONEY>$4</MONEY> per 
adult admission, to cover rental fees for the hall. 
</P>
<P>
(Seven monthly contra dances in the <LOCATION>Los Angeles-Orange County</LOCATION> area are listed 
in the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> Dance Co-Operative bulletin, which promises "No partner or 
experience necessary. All dances taught and prompted.") 
</P>
<P>
The live music, <PERSON>Russell</PERSON> said, is a vital ingredient of contra dances. 
</P>
<P>
"This music has a way of reminding us of people we love," she said. "My 
grandfather and great uncles played various instruments at local dances in 
<LOCATION>North Dakota</LOCATION> and in a small-town band that was something straight out of 'The 
Music Man.' Maybe this music gives us those people and those times back, when 
people were more of a community, dependent upon each other in real ways. You'll 
find strangers talking to each other at this dance and that sense of 
community." 
</P>
<P>
Music that emanates from a live band instead of a record player also sets 
contra dancing apart from square-dancing, <PERSON>Russell</PERSON> added. 
</P>
<P>
"There's very little square-dancing that I know of, at least in <LOCATION>Southern 
California</LOCATION>, that's done to live music. I think square-dancers are more into 
developing precision moves and good-looking things out on the dance floor. 
Maybe there are people who get more pleasure out of precision. But this music 
is more loose and forgiving." 
</P>
<P>
By the time <PERSON>Russell</PERSON> rejoins the band on stage, most of the potluck supper 
dishes brought by dancers have been polished off and folks are out on the 
scuffed wooden floor, following the patient instructions of caller <PERSON>Wayne 
Battleson</PERSON> as he explains the steps of the first dance. With his long brown 
ponytail and cordless headset microphone, Battleson looks like he might be more 
at home fronting a heavy-metal band than explaining do-si-dos. 
</P>
<P>
But it's obvious that he has a way with contra clarification. Even the 
beginners out on the floor learn very quickly how to differentiate between 
"active" and "inactive," "top" and "bottom" couples. Before they know it, they 
have graduated to sashays and balances, stars and courtesy turns. 
</P>
<P>
Then the band strikes up, and it's time to put the newly acquired terminology 
into action. Joining the band on stage are a couple of musicians who are 
sitting in. That too, <PERSON>Russell</PERSON> said, is a part of the contra dance tradition. 
</P>
<P>
"Anyone who wants to can come up and play on stage with us, but whether or not 
they'll be on microphone is another matter," she said. "The group spirit is the 
pervasive idea." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, there is quite a mix of ethnic backgrounds, ages and fashion styles 
out on the floor. One dancer who looks to be about 12 is swinging his partner 
with the best of them in high-top tennis shoes and a pink shirt stamped Off 
Limits. But the youngest participant is 15-month-old <PERSON>David Blair</PERSON>. He giggles 
with every bounce as his mother, <LOCATION>Zona</LOCATION>, balances him on one hip and gamely 
extends her free hand to various partners up and down the line. A few dancers 
zip through the steps with no-nonsense looks on their faces, but most looked 
relaxed and smile frequently, taking time to make funny faces at little <PERSON>David</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
Battleson's calls are easy to follow, but when someone loses the way, there are 
usually arms reaching out to help errant dancers back into proper position 
before they reel entirely out of control. The quick, rhythmic clasping of hands 
and synchronized negotiation of turns can be strangely thrilling -- perhaps a 
bit like trapeze work, with just a fraction of the risk. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Ruth Shapin</PERSON>, 59, a lawyer from <ORGANIZATION>Orange</ORGANIZATION>, has been coming to the <LOCATION>Anaheim</LOCATION> dance 
since its early days. "I like the sociability of contra dancing -- the way you 
dance all up and down the lines," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Her husband, <PERSON>Ted</PERSON>, a 62-year-old engineer, said the <PERSON>Shapins</PERSON>' daughter recently 
participated in a "dance friendship exchange" in the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>. "They 
brought their own band and caller and taught the Soviets how to contra," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In a sea of pastel <DATE>summer</DATE> clothes, <PERSON>Shannon Batts</PERSON>' black miniskirt and boots and 
<PERSON>Steve Jackson</PERSON>'s skull-print pants and fedora make them stand out in the crowd 
of dancers. Yet they too are contra veterans -- and regard themselves as the 
resident jesters as well, always stirring up mischief even as they execute 
steps skillfully. Jackson frequently punctuated the beat of the banjo music 
with a tweet on a whistle, and he and <PERSON>Batts</PERSON> led all the dancers in shouts of 
"lemonade!" to rhyme with the caller's command of "promenade." 
</P>
<P>
"I got into dancing because I wanted to have a chance to play and use my body 
and have a release after sitting around and being intellectual all day," said 
<PERSON>Jackson</PERSON>, 30, a <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> edit clerk. 
</P>
<P>
"This particular dance is different from all the other contras I know," said 
<PERSON>Batts</PERSON>, 26, a psychiatric aide and a graduate student in the counseling program 
at <ORGANIZATION>Cal State Fullerton</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"This dance is very community-oriented," she said. "We bring out food and 
flowers and children. The other dances aren't like that. (Those) are just three 
hours of hard-core dancing." 
</P>
<P>
During the band's break, a couple of the musicians strolled over to a reporter 
to offer a cup of lemonade and a quick tutorial about the "old-time" music they 
play at contras. 
</P>
<P>
"You need a good tune that allows you to follow the dance throughout," said <PERSON>Ira 
Gwin</PERSON>, 49, director of community development for the <ORGANIZATION>City of Commerce</ORGANIZATION> when he is 
not the main fiddle man in several bands. 
</P>
<P>
"You should be able to sense through the music what the next dance move should 
be," banjo player <PERSON>Jack Phillips</PERSON> elaborated. "We play a Southern Mountain 
Appalachian style of dance music, which is different from the <LOCATION>New England</LOCATION> 
style. They do a lot more jigs in six-eight time." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Carty Wilson</PERSON>, a mandolin player from <LOCATION>Long Beach</LOCATION>, stressed that the music this 
band plays at contras is very different from bluegrass. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the things we're trying to do here is to perpetuate the older style of 
music," he said. "Bluegrass is a flashy style primarily for performance. This 
style of music is pre-bluegrass." 
</P>
<P>
By <TIME>11:30 p.m.</TIME>, the lemonade jug was drained and all but the most die-hard 
dancers were tuckered out. Even the energetic children, who spent their contra 
time skipping rope and playing tag on the sidelines, were flagging. Some 
dancers helpfully dragged folding chairs into place for the youth theater group 
that would take over the hall the next day. Others made their way out the door 
slowly, picking up jelly jars full of dark brown honey that fiddle player <PERSON>Gwin</PERSON> 
had harvested from his bees. 
</P>
<P>
Caller Battleson, a land-surveyor in his non-dancing time, offered the 
evening's final opinion on why a quaint little activity like contra dancing is 
thriving in the shadow of the Matterhorn and other more glitzy entertainment 
alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
"It's vigorous, flirtatious, social and a way to have a fun time without going 
out to the bars," he said. "And the people are just tremendous. You meet the 
best people contra dancing." 
</P>
<P>
 Contra dancing takes place <DATE>Saturday</DATE> and every third <DATE>Saturday</DATE> of the month, 
from 7 to <TIME>11:30 p.m.</TIME> at the <ORGANIZATION>Anaheim Cultural Arts Center</ORGANIZATION>, 931 <LOCATION>N. Harbor Blvd.</LOCATION>, 
<LOCATION>Anaheim</LOCATION>. Admission: Adults <MONEY>$4</MONEY>, children free. Information: (714) 638-1466.

HOW SAVVY TRAVELERS TO THE ALOHA STATE CAN TRIM THEIR TABS AND NEVER MISS OUT

By BARBARA SHEA, Shea writes for Newsday. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It had been a busy day of sun and surf, and I was recharging with a free 
welcome cocktail on my hotel terrace in a tiny beachfront garden, a seashell's 
throw from the <ORGANIZATION>Hilton Hawaiian Village</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
As I idly glanced up at the resort's skyscrapers, I caught a <ORGANIZATION>Hilton</ORGANIZATION> guest 
looking down on me -- socially as well as logistically, it was clear. His eyes 
quickly dismissed the rustic two-story complex comprising my lodging, its lone 
"tower" a puny six stories. 
</P>
<P>
But my little patch of paradise -- called the Waikikian on the Beach -- had its 
charms. It was friendly and attractive, with Polynesian-style thatched-roof 
units bordering a torch-lit garden path. Though my lofty neighbor may not have 
been lured by my one small restaurant-nightspot, I liked its folksy appeal. On 
the other hand, I also regularly tapped the adjoining <ORGANIZATION>Hilton</ORGANIZATION>'s handy wealth of 
shops, eateries and entertainment. And, of course, we both shared the same 
stretch of wide and wonderful <LOCATION>Waikiki Beach</LOCATION>. The Waikikian's biggest plus, 
however, was my daily tab: <MONEY>$59</MONEY>. 
</P>
<P>
OK, so I didn't have a TV set or air-conditioning. But who needs "Roseanne" 
when you have ukuleles and hula dancers at your doorstep? And <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>'s brisk 
trade winds cooled my basic-level room so effectively that I never switched on 
the ceiling fan. 
</P>
<P>
The Waikikian is only one of a number of lesser-known alternatives to the major 
hotels that house most <LOCATION>Honolulu</LOCATION> tourists. Some of the biggies are 
budget-minded, too, but visitors who stake out one of the smaller, homier oases 
are more likely to be beguiled by a certain <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION> magic. 
</P>
<P>
Another low-rise charmer even closer to the center of the action is the 95-room 
Hawaiiana, set in a lushly landscaped private enclave half a block from the 
beach. Its two- and three-level units -- some with terraces, or lanais, as they 
are called in the <ORGANIZATION>Aloha State</ORGANIZATION> -- snake around two swimming pools. A spacious 
double here, with color TV, air-conditioning and fully equipped kitchen, runs 
<MONEY>$75</MONEY> to <MONEY>$95</MONEY>. The cordial <ORGANIZATION>Hawaiiana</ORGANIZATION> offers a wealth of free extras, including 
beach mats, morning coffee and juice, daily newspaper delivered to your door, 
use of a washer and dryer, plus a welcoming gift of a fresh pineapple and a 
parting remembrance of a fragrant flower lei. You'll find a lot of regulars, 
and you'll feel as if you're among old friends from the minute you check in. 
</P>
<P>
For a refuge altogether removed from the tourist fray, there's the venerable 
<ORGANIZATION>Manoa Valley Inn</ORGANIZATION>, tucked away on a residential street two miles from the beach, 
near the <ORGANIZATION>University of Hawaii</ORGANIZATION> campus. You'll feel like a wealthy landowner 
while relaxing on the wide veranda of this lovingly restored plantation house, 
which was snatched from demolition by <PERSON>Rick Ralston</PERSON>, president of trendy <ORGANIZATION>Crazy 
Shirts</ORGANIZATION>, and is now on the <ORGANIZATION>National Register of Historic Places</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Rates for the seven antique-furnished rooms and private cottage are <MONEY>$80</MONEY> to <MONEY>$145</MONEY> 
and include a generous continental breakfast plus afternoon wine and cheese. 
Guests are encouraged to help themselves to decanters of sherry and bowls of 
candies on the second- and third-floor landings, and are urged to play the 
old-fashioned nickelodeon (a pile of nickels is provided) or the new-fangled TV 
and VCR in the parlor. You may hardly see another guest and half-believe the 
house is yours alone, or you may strike up friendships as you watch the lights 
of <LOCATION>Waikiki</LOCATION> twinkle on at dusk from the porch swing of this hillside perch. 
Visitors without a rental car can catch the No. 4 bus two blocks away and be on 
the beach in 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>Manoa Valley Inn</ORGANIZATION> is the showplace among the growing number of B&amp;B's in 
the Hawaiian islands. Numerous agencies -- some local, some statewide -- match 
guests and rooms, the cost of which start as low as <MONEY>$20</MONEY> a night plus a small 
reservation fee. You may even luck into a view of your own and a private beach. 
Most B&amp;Bs, though, are a considerable distance from the bright lights of 
<LOCATION>Waikiki</LOCATION>, so a car is advisable. 
</P>
<P>
We found other inexpensive <LOCATION>Waikiki</LOCATION> lodgings. The Outrigger chain offers a score 
of possibilities, most in the budget range. And the <ORGANIZATION>Hawaii Visitors Bureau</ORGANIZATION> 
publishes a free tip sheet, <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION> on a Budget, listing hotels, condos, 
cottages and B&amp;B's for each island, under the heading "Where to Stay for 
Under <MONEY>$65</MONEY> per Day." 
</P>
<P>
If you stay at one of the several dozen hotels affiliated with a new local 
agency, the <ORGANIZATION>Hotel Exchange</ORGANIZATION>, which has set up shop in the <ORGANIZATION>Hawaiian Colony Hotel</ORGANIZATION> 
at <DATE>1946</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>Ala Moana Blvd.</ORGANIZATION>, near the <ORGANIZATION>Hilton</ORGANIZATION>, you can save <MONEY>$10</MONEY> to <MONEY>$25</MONEY> on the daily 
room rate. I stumbled upon the agency through an ad in a <LOCATION>Waikiki</LOCATION> tourist 
magazine and shaved <MONEY>$10</MONEY> off the already bargain price of <MONEY>$69</MONEY> that was quoted to 
me by the Waikikian. Now the <ORGANIZATION>Exchange</ORGANIZATION> expects to sign up several major hotels 
in <LOCATION>Waikiki</LOCATION>, so that those who insist on traveling in style can save a few 
bucks, too. 
</P>
<P>
Following is a guide to keeping down costs in other categories. 
</P>
<P>
Air-hotel packages usually are the cheapest option for tourists who don't mind 
an <ORGANIZATION>if-it</ORGANIZATION>'s-Tuesday-this-must-be-Oahu pace. Independent travelers do best if 
they can snag one of the air fare specials that crop up now and then -- 
particularly in <DATE>spring</DATE> and <DATE>fall</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Island-hopping is the local pastime so inter-island fares are fairly reasonable 
(<MONEY>$49.95</MONEY> one way between <LOCATION>Honolulu</LOCATION> and any other island). You can save <MONEY>$15</MONEY> each 
way by taking the first and last flight of the day. 
</P>
<P>
Getting around: To get from <LOCATION>Honolulu</LOCATION> airport to <LOCATION>Waikiki</LOCATION>, hop a shuttle bus 
outside the terminal. The tab is <MONEY>$5</MONEY> to any hotel, as opposed to <MONEY>$15</MONEY> or <MONEY>$20</MONEY> for 
a cab. 
</P>
<P>
I'd skip the <LOCATION>Waikiki Trolley</LOCATION>, which for <MONEY>$10 offers</MONEY> a cursory spiel and an 
all-day pass allowing passengers to jump on and off at pickup points around 
town. You'll do as well for less on the public buses, guidebook in hand; the 
fare is <MONEY>60 cents</MONEY> -- whether you ride down the block or around the island. 
</P>
<P>
Rental cars are advertised at rates as low as <MONEY>$5</MONEY> a day, although you'll 
probably spend closer to <MONEY>$20</MONEY>, since the rock-bottom models never seem to be 
available. Shop around. Most car-rental firms also offer tie-in discounts at 
various tourist attractions. 
</P>
<P>
Many hotels and restaurants advertise happy hours -- some run virtually all day 
-- featuring snacks, music and reduced drink prices (as low as <MONEY>$1.50</MONEY> for the 
ubiquitous Mai Tai or <ORGANIZATION>Tropical Itch</ORGANIZATION>, the latter served with a 12-inch back 
scratcher as a swizzle stick). 
</P>
<P>
Shopping: <LOCATION>Waikiki</LOCATION> wares run the gamut from trash to treasure, and it is 
possible to find lovely fashions among the millions of mass-produced muumuus 
and aloha shirts. Before you buy anything anywhere, compare prices at the <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION> 
convenience stores and at <ORGANIZATION>Liberty House</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Macy</ORGANIZATION>'s of <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
If you really love a bargain, take the escalator to the fifth floor of the 
<ORGANIZATION>Waikiki Shopping Center</ORGANIZATION> on main-drag <LOCATION>Kalakaua Boulevard</LOCATION> and browse through 
<PERSON>Betty</PERSON>'s Import and Export, where for <MONEY>50 cents</MONEY> or <MONEY>$1</MONEY> you can find the same 
shell-and-stone jewelry you see in the International Bazaar shops for 10 or 20 
times more. Stop at the third floor, as well, and look in on Ali's Jewelry and 
Exotic leather, where prices of soft eel-skin items such as wallets start at 
<MONEY>$5</MONEY>. 
</P>
<P>
Less widely known than the popular <ORGANIZATION>Kodak Hula Show</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Kapiolani Park</LOCATION>, near 
<ORGANIZATION>Diamond Head</ORGANIZATION> volcano, is the <ORGANIZATION>Young People</ORGANIZATION>'s Hula Show at <TIME>9:30 a.m.</TIME> every <DATE>Sunday</DATE> 
at the opposite end of <LOCATION>Waikiki</LOCATION>, on Center Stage in <LOCATION>Ala Moana</LOCATION> mall. The 
pint-sized dancers -- boys as well as girls, some as young as 2 -- show off 
what they've learned about <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>'s cultural traditions, and their contortions 
will tickle you more than running into <PERSON>Richard Chamberlain</PERSON> and the cast of 
"Island Son." It's one show that would be worth almost any price, but it 
underscores the fact that even in <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>, many of the most enjoyable things are 
free.

POP BEAT / COUNTRY: THERE'S A DROUGHT, BUT THREE NEWCOMERS SHOW PROMISE

<P>
The search continues in country music. 
</P>
<P>
From the late '40s through mid-<DATE>'70s</DATE>, the country world produced so many great 
singers and records that it was easy for outsiders to underestimate the degree 
of artistry required. 
</P>
<P>
All you needed was a singer with character and conviction, instrumental backing 
that accented rather than diluted the emotion and a memorable song. The latter, 
preferably, included at least one easily quotable line. 
</P>
<P>
And there seemed no end of a supply of great artists: from <PERSON>Hank Williams</PERSON> and 
<PERSON>Lefty Frizzell</PERSON> to <PERSON>Johnny Cash</PERSON> and <PERSON>Willie Nelson</PERSON>, and from <PERSON>Kitty Wells</PERSON> and <PERSON>Patsy 
Cline</PERSON> to <PERSON>Dolly Parton</PERSON> and <PERSON>Emmylou Harris</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
But the great artists and great records have now become the exception in 
country music. Only two mainstream <LOCATION>Nashville</LOCATION> figures have emerged in the last 
dozen or so years to even approach the consistency or vision of the singers 
cited above -- <PERSON>John Anderson</PERSON> and <PERSON>Randy Travis</PERSON> -- and both seemed more echoes of 
the earlier stars than breakthroughs. 
</P>
<P>
Two other, more recent arrivals, k.d. lang and <PERSON>Lyle Lovett</PERSON>, have shown 
exceptional promise, but both are mavericks who haven't been fully accepted in 
<LOCATION>Nashville</LOCATION> as part of the official country family. 
</P>
<P>
This lingering drought in country music is why so much attention in <LOCATION>Nashville</LOCATION> 
is focused these days on newcomers. Here's a look at some of the lastest 
country contenders. None joins the honor roll on the basis of these new albums, 
but there are some twinkles of promise. The albums are rated on a five-star 
scale, from one (poor) to five (a classic). 
</P>
<P>
*** <PERSON>Jann Browne</PERSON>'s "Tell Me Why" (Curb) -- One reason the music of this veteran 
of <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION> honky-tonks seems so reminiscent of <PERSON>Emmylou Harris</PERSON> is 
that <PERSON>Steve Fishell</PERSON>, who used to play steel guitar in <PERSON>Harris</PERSON>' band, produced it 
and other musicians who have been associated with <PERSON>Harris</PERSON> play on the album. It 
also doesn't hurt that <PERSON>Harris</PERSON> sings harmony on one track. 
</P>
<P>
However, the main reason <PERSON>Browne</PERSON> makes you think of country music's most 
enchanting female singer is that <PERSON>Browne</PERSON> sings with a similar purity and sense 
of integrity as <PERSON>Harris</PERSON>. She, too, can can make a new song (her own "Mexican 
Wind," a soulful tale of romantic loss) feel like a classic or inject new life 
into an old favorite (<PERSON>Harlan Howard-Fuzzy Owen</PERSON>'s "The One You Slip Around 
With"). Strong potential. 
</P>
<P>
*** <PERSON>Mark Collie</PERSON>'s "Hardin County Line" (MCA) -- Collie would have been at home 
in country in the <DATE>'50s</DATE>, when rockabilly and honky-tonk shuffle were the rage. 
He sings both styles with a biting authenticity and is backed by a first-rate 
band that includes guitarist <PERSON>James Burton</PERSON>, who was <ORGANIZATION>Elvis Presley</ORGANIZATION>'s guitarist 
for years. He also writes lots of quotable lines. 
</P>
<P>
Collie is a little too intent on touching all the thematic country bases 
(ramblin' fever, the old days), but most of his songs about relationships have 
a wry, bittersweet edge. In the opening track, <ORGANIZATION>Collie</ORGANIZATION> tells about stumbling 
home after working the all-night shift to find a note attached to the freezer: 
"The good news is she loves me / The bad news is she's gone." Elsewhere, he 
offers, "Now where there's smoke, you'll find my old flame." 
</P>
<P>
* 1/2 <PERSON>Alan Jackson</PERSON>'s "Here in the Real World" (<ORGANIZATION>Arista</ORGANIZATION>) -- <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON> aims high. 
He's quoted on the inside sleeve of the album package as saying, "You know that 
country song, 'Who's Gonna Fill Them Shoes?' I don't know whether I can fill 
'em, but I'd sure like to try 'em on." In this debut collection, <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON> is off 
to a fast start commercially. The album has been in the country Top 10 since 
<DATE>April 21</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
If he's truly hoping to fill the shoes of such country greats as <PERSON>George Jones</PERSON>, 
however, he's got a long way to go. The artist he most resembles (in cowboy-hat 
image and musical style) is contemporary <PERSON>Dwight Yoakam</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
Like the latter, <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON> is good at approximating emotion, but he doesn't show 
much original vision or musical soul. Selections such as "Blue Blooded Woman" 
have quotable lines, but they're mostly <LOCATION>Nashville</LOCATION> hokum. Sample: "She loves a 
violin, I love a fiddle / We go separate ways but we meet in the middle / Don't 
see eye to eye, but we're hand in hand / A blue-blooded woman and a red-neck 
man." 
</P>
<P>
* 1/2 <PERSON>Travis Tritt</PERSON>'s "Country Club" (<ORGANIZATION>Warner Bros.</ORGANIZATION>) -- Joining <PERSON>Alan Jackson</PERSON> in 
the country Top 10 these days, <PERSON>Tritt</PERSON> is equally suspect. He deals in a 
harder-edged, semi-rock brand of country, suggesting his model is more <PERSON>Hank 
Williams Jr.</PERSON> than <PERSON>George Jones</PERSON>. There's a sense of drama in his singing and in 
the arrangements, but the themes -- as telegraphed in such song titles as "Son 
of the New South" and "The Road Home" -- have been part of the accepted country 
songbook for years. The singing is generally undistinguished, the arrangements 
are routine and the album's most quotable line comes from a song ("Country 
Club") that <PERSON>Tritt</PERSON> didn't write. 
</P>
<P>
** 1/2 <PERSON>Kelly Willis</PERSON>' "Well Traveled Love" (MCA) -- This 21-year-old, 
Austin-based singer exudes such personality and spirit that she reminds you of 
the early promise of <ORGANIZATION>Lone Justice</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Maria McKee</PERSON>, a point that wasn't lost on 
<PERSON>Carlyne Majer</PERSON>, who worked with <ORGANIZATION>Lone Justice</ORGANIZATION> and now manages <PERSON>Willis</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
Willis balances feelings of spunky optimism and lesson-learned caution so well 
in the opening track that you think the album is going to soar. While her voice 
continues to dazzle, the album is limited by often pedestrian instrumental 
backing and by too few top-notch songs. The next album may be the real test.

<P>
In the past months, several jazz-related books have reached the stores, some of 
which are worth keeping in mind. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
JAZZ SINGING By <PERSON>Will Friedwald</PERSON> (<ORGANIZATION>Scribners</ORGANIZATION>: <MONEY>$29.95</MONEY>; 477 pages) 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>Friedwald</LOCATION>, at 29, is young enough to have total dogmatic belief in his every 
statement. Highly opinionated and not always accurate (he credits <PERSON>Fats Waller</PERSON>'s 
song "Black and Blue" to <PERSON>Eubie Blake</PERSON>), "Jazz Singing" could more accurately 
have been titled "Jazz and Pop Singing," since many pages are devoted to 
obscure pop figures such as <PERSON>Al Bowlly</PERSON> and Cliff (<ORGANIZATION>Ukulele Ike</ORGANIZATION>) <PERSON>Edwards</PERSON>, along 
with <PERSON>Doris Day</PERSON> and <PERSON>Dick Haymes</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
Friedwald later rambles on at length about <PERSON>Betty Carter</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mark Murphy</PERSON>, but 
dismisses <PERSON>Helen Merrill</PERSON> in one line, then consigns <PERSON>Cleo Laine</PERSON> and the <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION> 
Transfer to the dust heap. Irreverent and iconoclastic, <ORGANIZATION>Friedwald</ORGANIZATION> nevertheless 
is readable, informative and witty. You may even enjoy indulging in mental 
arguments with him and will wish you could reply to some of his more outrageous 
statements. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
REMINISCING IN TEMPO By <ORGANIZATION>Teddy Reig</ORGANIZATION> (Scarecrow: <MONEY>$29.50</MONEY>; 204 pages) 
</P>
<P>
Subtitled "The Life and Times of a Jazz Hustler," the story of <PERSON>Reig</PERSON> (1918-1984) 
was fleshed out after his death by <PERSON>Ed Berger</PERSON> and by friends who recall him with 
affection. A fringe character, almost literally larger than life at 350 pounds, 
<PERSON>Reig</PERSON> went to jail in <DATE>1942</DATE> for possession of marijuana (a big scandal in those 
days). Later he became a close friend of jazzmen, producing records with Basie, 
<ORGANIZATION>Bird</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Belafonte</PERSON> and others. With its nostalgic recollections, mostly of <LOCATION>Harlem</LOCATION>, 
this is a useful social document marred by its brevity and its omissions. For 
example, <PERSON>Reig</PERSON> worked with <ORGANIZATION>Birdland</ORGANIZATION> owner <PERSON>Morris Levy</PERSON>, whose organized crime 
connections, detailed in the recent book "Hit Men," are ignored here. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
DRUMMIN' MEN By <PERSON>Burt Korall</PERSON> (<ORGANIZATION>Macmillan</ORGANIZATION>: <MONEY>$24.95</MONEY>; 381 pages) 
</P>
<P>
The author, briefly a drummer himself, informatively examines what he calls 
"The Heartbeat of Jazz (in) The Swing Years," with affection. Seven drummers 
are spotlighted: <ORGANIZATION>Chick Webb</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Gene Krupa</PERSON>, <PERSON>Ray McKinley</PERSON> (the only one still 
alive), <PERSON>Jo Jones</PERSON>, <PERSON>Sid Catlett</PERSON>, the greatly underrated <PERSON>Dave Tough</PERSON>, and Buddy 
Rich. Seven others are dealt with briefly. <PERSON>Korall</PERSON> enlivens his essays with 
plenty of quotes from admirers of his subjects. This will appeal not only to 
drummers but to anyone interested in the social and musical overtones of the 
role played by percussionists in jazz. Drummer <PERSON>Mel Torme</PERSON>'s foreword is 
delightful. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
POETS OF TIN PAN ALLEY By <PERSON>Philip Furia</PERSON> (Oxford: <MONEY>$22.95</MONEY>; 322 pages) 
</P>
<P>
What <PERSON>Alec Wilder</PERSON> did for melodies in his classic "American Popular Song" (see 
below), Furia now does for the lyricists. It is odd that a work so 
microscopically analytical of <LOCATION>Berlin</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Porter</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Ira Gershwin</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Lorenz Hart</PERSON> and the 
rest should be unaware (like <PERSON>Friedwald</PERSON>) of the difference between who and whom, 
yet Furia is on firm ground most of the way. The balance between historical 
detail and examinations of specific songs is well maintained, resulting in a 
volume that devotes, for example, 20 valuable pages to <PERSON>Johnny Mercer</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
It is unfortunate that Furia chose to segregate what he calls "jazz lyricists" 
into a separate chapter (there is no such animal). He all but ignores the 
magnificent work by <PERSON>Andy Razaf</PERSON> ("Honeysuckle Rose," "Ain't Misbehavin' ") while 
crediting <PERSON>Irving Mills</PERSON> -- a manager and publisher (mainly associated with <ORGANIZATION>Duke 
Ellington</ORGANIZATION>) who was never seriously regarded as a songwriter -- with lyrics to 
which <PERSON>Mills</PERSON> himself probably would not lay claim (he employed many 
collaborators). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
INSIDE PAUL HORN By <PERSON>Paul Horn</PERSON> with <PERSON>Lee Underwood</PERSON> (<PERSON>Harper Collins</PERSON>: <MONEY>$19.95</MONEY>; 284 
pages) 
</P>
<P>
Well known in the <DATE>1960s</DATE> as a <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> based sax-and-flute soloist, <PERSON>Horn</PERSON> 
wrote the first jazz mass, then became involved in a spiritual odyssey and was 
a student of the <ORGANIZATION>Maharishi Mahesh Yogi</ORGANIZATION>. He ultimately opted for a life of 
serenity and seclusion, though he still travels the world from his home in 
<LOCATION>Victoria</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>B.C.</LOCATION>, where he's been based since <DATE>1970</DATE>. Though the second half of the 
book is concerned with Horn's travels rather than with music, the story, 
reflecting his evolution as a global thinker and his sensitive self-awareness, 
is of absorbing interest. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
AMERICAN SINGERS By <PERSON>Whitney Balliett</PERSON> (Oxford: <MONEY>$9.95</MONEY>; 244 pages) 
</P>
<P>
Written between <DATE>1970</DATE> and <DATE>1984</DATE>, these 27 essays exemplify the insightful grace 
of <ORGANIZATION>Balliett</ORGANIZATION>'s prose. Though some of the singers are obscure (<PERSON>Hugh Shannon</PERSON>, <PERSON>Mary 
Mayo</PERSON>) and one deals with a pianist who rarely sings (<ORGANIZATION>George Shearing</ORGANIZATION>), each 
piece justifies itself as a stylistic gem. Regrettably, no dates are given, and 
several deceased subjects (<PERSON>Helen Humes</PERSON>, <PERSON>Alberta Hunter</PERSON>) are discussed in the 
present tense. At its paperback price, this is an essential purchase. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
FROM BLUES TO BOP By Various writers (<LOCATION>Louisiana State U.</LOCATION> Press: <MONEY>$24.95</MONEY>; 295 
pages) 
</P>
<P>
This is, perhaps inevitably because of the sporadic use of jazz as a subject 
for fiction, a highly uneven collection. Edited by <PERSON>Richard Albert</PERSON>, it includes 
a few valuable pieces: <PERSON>Langston Hughes</PERSON>' "Dance," <PERSON>James Baldwin</PERSON>'s "Sonny's 
Blues," and an evocative work by <PERSON>Josef Skvorcky</PERSON>, best known for "The Brass 
Saxophone." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
In Brief: 
</P>
<P>
"American Popular Song" by <PERSON>Alec Wilder</PERSON>, <MONEY>$29.95</MONEY>, 536 pages, now with a foreword 
by <PERSON>Gene Lees</PERSON>, has been reissued by <ORGANIZATION>Oxford</ORGANIZATION> and remains the definitive work on 
the great innovators from <DATE>1900</DATE> to <DATE>1950</DATE> . . . "As Thousands Cheer," by <PERSON>Laurence 
Bergreen</PERSON>, <MONEY>$24.95</MONEY>, 658 pages) is the well-researched (with no help from the 
subject) biography of <PERSON>Irving Berlin</PERSON>, who detested jazz but many of whose songs 
became jazz standards . . . "Meet Me at <PERSON>Jim</PERSON> and Andy's," by <PERSON>Gene Lees</PERSON> (<ORGANIZATION>Oxford</ORGANIZATION>, 
<MONEY>$8.95</MONEY>, 265 pages) is a paperback reprint of 13 brilliant essays by <PERSON>Gene Lees</PERSON>, 
culled from his monthly Jazzletter.

<HEADLINE>  A DAWG HUNTS UP OLD FRIEND
DAVID GRISMAN AND JERRY GARCIA RENEW A MUSICAL
ACQUAINTANCE  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  MUSIC  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     It was the <DATE>summer of 1965</DATE>, and <PERSON>Grisman</PERSON> was a young, urban "bluegrass
maniac" from <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION>, visiting friends in <LOCATION>Palo Alto</LOCATION>. While in the <LOCATION>Bay Area</LOCATION>,
he looked up a banjo-playing acquaintance whom he had met the year before at a
country music park in <LOCATION>Westborough</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pa.</LOCATION>, and who had since formed a rock band.;
   <PERSON>Grisman</PERSON> took an instant shine to the group's jug-band style. "They were
playing parties at people's swimming pools, doing (Bob) <PERSON>Dylan</PERSON> and folk
tunes.";    Returning East, he shared his enthusiasm with a writer for "Sing
Out!" magazine, who mentioned the band, called the Warlocks, in his column.;  
 Weeks later, at the San Jose Acid Test, <PERSON>Jerry Garcia</PERSON> and his Warlocks tried
on a new name: the Grateful Dead.;    "I got them their first national press,"
<PERSON>Grisman</PERSON> brags. "I've been telling that story a lot lately.";    This bout of
boastful reminiscing has been kindled, no doubt, by <PERSON>Grisman</PERSON>'s latest project:
"Garcia/Grisman," an acoustic tour de force that pairs the top <ORGANIZATION>Dawg</ORGANIZATION>'s
crystal-pure mandolin sound with Captain Trip's remarkably clean, complex
guitar work.;    <PERSON>Grisman</PERSON> and <PERSON>Garcia</PERSON>'s professional collaborations have been
scattered but satisfying, dating back to the early '70s, when <PERSON>Grisman</PERSON> appeared
on the Dead's landmark "American Beauty" album (<DATE>1970</DATE>), playing mandolin on
"Ripple" and "Friend of the Devil." A couple of years later, <PERSON>Garcia</PERSON> dusted off
his banjo to collaborate with <PERSON>Grisman</PERSON> on "Old and In the Way" (<DATE>1973</DATE>), a loose
but legendary bluegrass band that included <PERSON>Vassar Clements</PERSON> on fiddle,
guitarist/songwriter <PERSON>Peter Rowan</PERSON> and bassist <PERSON>John Kahn.</PERSON>;    But <PERSON>Grisman</PERSON> was
coming into his own with "Dawg" music, a distillation of jazz, bluegrass,
folk, classical and ethnic stylings for acoustic strings; <PERSON>Garcia</PERSON> had his
obligations with the Dead; and <PERSON>Rowan</PERSON> was holding a steadfast bluegrass line.
Nine months later, "Old and in the Way" collapsed under its own musical
weight.;    <PERSON>Grisman</PERSON> went on to form the <ORGANIZATION>Great American Music Band</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1974</DATE>, and
<PERSON>Garcia</PERSON> would occasionally sit in on banjo. But their paths rarely crossed
after that.;    <PERSON>Garcia</PERSON> continued to dabble in acoustic music, even forming the
<ORGANIZATION>Jerry Garcia Acoustic Band</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1987</DATE>. But it was his electric guitar work with
the Dead that devoured most of his time and eventually defined his style.;   
In the meantime, with his ever-keen eye for raw talent, <PERSON>Grisman</PERSON> assembled the
<PERSON>David Grisman Quintet</PERSON>, a tight group of premier young musicians that included
at one time or another such Dawg disciples as <PERSON>Mike Marshall</PERSON>, <PERSON>Darol Anger</PERSON>, <PERSON>Tony
Rice</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mark O'Connor.</PERSON>;    Reunion was inevitable;  But considering their
shared love for traditional and folk music, a <PERSON>Grisman</PERSON>- <PERSON>Garcia</PERSON> reunion proved
inevitable. Last year, they were drawn together one more time.;    "<PERSON>Jerry</PERSON> had
mentioned wanting to put out some old tapes and I said, 'Gee, why don't we do
something new?' One day he just came over with his guitar. I said, 'When do
you want to start?' He said 'Now.' Every time we got together, we recorded."; 
  They played two shows at <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Warfield Theater</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>February</DATE>, but
other than that, rehearsal for the album was negligible. "The stuff really
came together after those gigs. I like to go out there and play it before I
record. But I think you can take that too far, as well. There's something
about a fresh idea.";    In keeping with that approach, "Garcia/Grisman" is a
studio album, but each track was recorded without benefit of overdubbing.
Vocals (by <PERSON>Garcia</PERSON>) and instrumentals (including <PERSON>Jim Kerwin</PERSON> on bass and <PERSON>Joe
Craven</PERSON> on fiddle/ percussion) were put down as they played them, in the
basement studio of <PERSON>Grisman</PERSON>'s <LOCATION>Mill Valley</LOCATION> home.;    It's no secret the two have
hugely divergent performing styles. Any of <ORGANIZATION>Grisman's Deputy Dawgs</ORGANIZATION> will allow
as to what a tough taskmaster he is. How did that mesh with <PERSON>Garcia</PERSON>'s
considerably more, uh, relaxed attitude?;    "We both had a good effect on
each other," <PERSON>Grisman</PERSON> says. "A lot of his looseness rubbed off on me, a lot of
my discipline rubbed off on him. I like to lock the doors so people can't get
out till we're done. He likes to take a break after each take. There's a value
in each attitude.";    <PERSON>Garcia</PERSON>'s best acoustic work;  <PERSON>Grisman</PERSON> has squeezed from
<PERSON>Garcia</PERSON> some of his best acoustic work to date, especially on <PERSON>B.B. King</PERSON>'s "The
Thrill is Gone," <PERSON>Grisman</PERSON>'s "Arabia" and the song they co-wrote, "Grateful
Dawg." But what about his singing, best described as idiosyncratic?;    "I
think he has a lot of soul, a lot of character in his singing," <PERSON>Grisman</PERSON> says.
"I really dig it. Some people don't, but a lot obviously do. My experience
with playing with singers hasn't been that great. But <PERSON>Jerry</PERSON>'s sort of like a
singer who's more like a musician." High praise, coming from an acoustic
purist.;    Evidently both parties are pleased with the result: Already there
are plans for another album.;    "Jerry wants to get back into it," <PERSON>Grisman</PERSON>
says. "He's been practicing his banjo.";    Return to bluegrass?;  Does that
spell a return to their bluegrass roots?;    "I love traditional bluegrass.
But there's really no one to play with out here. Nothing against the <LOCATION>West
Coast</LOCATION> scene, but the musicians out here don't have the authentic vibe. I'm
spoiled on bluegrass, because I've played with the best. It's like if you like
Italian food and you've been to <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>, you don't want to get an Italian
chicken sandwich at Burger King.";    <PERSON>Grisman</PERSON> found that authentic vibe in a
musician who died more than 20 years ago, a man he calls the <PERSON>Bill Monroe</PERSON> of
<LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>. His next recording, due out in <DATE>October</DATE>, is a compilation culled from
the recordings of mandolin player <PERSON>Jacob do Bandolim</PERSON>, whom <PERSON>Grisman</PERSON> calls the
father of choro music.;    If it sounds a bit arcane for the mass market,
<PERSON>Grisman</PERSON> hardly seems concerned. After all, with a built-in market of Deadheads
for "Garcia/ <PERSON>Grisman</PERSON>," his new label, Acoustic Disc, is off on a healthy
footing.;    "There's a market for the music I'm into, so I might as well do
it myself. I only want to do the things that are really important.";  <PERSON>David
Grisman</PERSON>; With <PERSON>Jerry Garcia</PERSON>; When: <DATE>Sunday</DATE>; Where: <ORGANIZATION>Squaw Valley Summer Music
Festival; Gold Coast Concert Bowl</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Squaw Valley USA</ORGANIZATION>. Camping available.;
Tickets: (800) 444-7275 camping; (408) 998-2277, (415) 762-2277 concerts.;

NIGHT LIFE: MICHAEL ON FIRE LIVES UP TO NAME WHEN WRITING AND SINGING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL LOCEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You know you've made The Big Time when you no longer need a last name. Who can 
forget <ORGANIZATION>Cleopatra, Elvis</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Madonna</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Bogie</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Zsa Zsa</PERSON>, The <ORGANIZATION>Duke</ORGANIZATION>, God, <ORGANIZATION>Sabu</ORGANIZATION>, Goofy? 
Know what I mean? Electric folk singer <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> on Fire is another example of a 
guy with no surname. All he needs now is half of <ORGANIZATION>Milli Vanilli</ORGANIZATION>'s money. 
</P>
<P>
Michael On Fire, which is the singer's legal name, lives in the <LOCATION>San Fernando 
Valley</LOCATION> by way of <LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION> and loves the <LOCATION>Lakers</LOCATION>, except when they play the 
Pistons. He says that a Sioux Indian medicine man gave him his name. 
</P>
<P>
When he's not performing, <ORGANIZATION>MOF</ORGANIZATION> is writing. And writing. And writing. He has 
between 1,200 and a zillion songs -- this guy could play longer than the 
Grateful Dead. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people water their plants every day; I write. Not every song is a gem, 
but there's usually a line or two worth saving for another song -- I've got 
quite a catalogue. The more you do something, the better you get at it. I'm a 
lifer. This is what I do. I feel like I've got five or six good albums in me 
right now. When I play, each set is longer than an album." 
</P>
<P>
Michael On Fire has this booming, sort of raspy voice that's as big as all 
outdoors -- the sort of voice everyone on <ORGANIZATION>MTV</ORGANIZATION> wishes were his. He's got this 
wild mane of hair, without mousse, and he doesn't look like one of those 
cheerleaders from high school. He's commercial-sounding and slicker than the 
trail of a 50-foot slug, not plastic and phony but convincing and real. Better 
yet, he never asks the obvious, "How's it goin', Ven-ch-ura?" 
</P>
<P>
And the singer is so relentlessly friendly and upbeat that he could sell a 
raincoat to a cactus. When he's not on stage, <ORGANIZATION>MOF</ORGANIZATION> chats with people in the 
audience. He must be a direct descendant of <PERSON>Mr. Rogers</PERSON> and Captain Kangaroo. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>MOF</ORGANIZATION> writes these reflective ballads that are at once sad and funny about the 
Big Issues -- love, the homeless, the environment, offshore drilling, ERA, 
<ORGANIZATION>American Indians</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Usually accompanying himself on acoustic guitar, <ORGANIZATION>MOF</ORGANIZATION> has this tight backup band 
that just got tighter -- like <PERSON>Roseanne Barr</PERSON> in a wet suit . . . in <LOCATION>Bakersfield</LOCATION> 
. . . in <DATE>August</DATE>. Stevie <PERSON>Ray Davis</PERSON> recently joined <ORGANIZATION>MOF</ORGANIZATION>. He's a guitarist who's 
in the <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> Music <PERSON>Hall</PERSON> of Fame where he has joined the likes of <PERSON>Jimmy Vaughan</PERSON> 
and <PERSON>Stevie Ray Vaughan</PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION>MOF</ORGANIZATION>'s folk rock songs now have a definite rockin' blues 
edge. <PERSON>Robbie Drum</PERSON> is the sax player and <PERSON>Tobias</PERSON> is the one-named percussionist. 
</P>
<P>
When he's not writing, <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> On Fire is <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> on tour. He's played in every 
state except <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION> and has opened for acts such as <PERSON>Stephen Stills</PERSON>, 
<PERSON>Peter Tosh</PERSON>, <PERSON>Jimmy Cliff</PERSON>, <PERSON>Bob Seger</PERSON>, <PERSON>Jean Luc Ponty</PERSON> and the Art Ensemble of 
<LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"My strangest gig was my first-ever gig. It was in east <LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION>, and I walked 
into this place with my guitar and they told me I had to sing from on top of 
the bar. So I'm up there doing '<PERSON>Mr. Tambourine Man</PERSON>' when all of a sudden on 
each side of me was a bona fide stripper. Man, it got real hard to remember the 
lyrics." 
</P>
<P>
"I average about five gigs per week -- I'm doing 24 shows in <DATE>April</DATE>. But I don't 
do those industry hangout gigs. I'm not into competition and that's not how I 
care to participate. Most places I play don't have cover charges, except in 
<DATE>January</DATE> when I played <LOCATION>Aspen</LOCATION> and it cost forty bucks to get in and a beer cost 
seven bucks. Industry people tell me I'm overexposing myself, but hey, this is 
my job . . ." 
</P>
<P>
It must be working too. <ORGANIZATION>MOF</ORGANIZATION> has a mailing list of more than 2,500 plus a tape, 
"Pre-Dawn Chronicles." The tape is available at his gigs and contains some of 
his best work -- "Lucifer's Returned To Heaven," "Oh Picasso" and "Ride On Into 
Midnight." The tape is as popular as a bulletproof building in <LOCATION>Beirut</LOCATION> -- 3,000 
units sold. A new tape is in the works. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>MOF</ORGANIZATION>'s influences are diverse. He cites <PERSON>Dion</PERSON>, <PERSON>Miles Davis</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Jimi Hendrix</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Lou 
Reed</PERSON>, <PERSON>Bob Dylan</PERSON>, <PERSON>Albert King</PERSON>, Fats Domino and <ORGANIZATION>Fleetwood Mac</ORGANIZATION>. About the only 
cover he ever does is an old <ORGANIZATION>Fleetwood Mac</ORGANIZATION> song -- <PERSON>Peter Green</PERSON>'s "Woman's Got 
The Blues" -- from <ORGANIZATION>Fleetwood</ORGANIZATION>'s blues guitar band days before <PERSON>Stevie Nicks</PERSON> and 
<PERSON>Christine McVie</PERSON> joined the group.

   The King of the World. The Master of Disaster.
The Big Man. After more than 20 years in rock 'n' roll and almost
as many nicknames, <PERSON>Clarence Clemons</PERSON> prefers the simple tag, <PERSON>Mr. C.</PERSON>
   ``All those names, it's a heavy cross to bear,'' said <PERSON>Clemons</PERSON>,
the mightiest supporting star of <PERSON>Bruce Springsteen</PERSON>'s E Street Band.
``I think about all that stuff, but `<PERSON>Mr. C</PERSON>' has evolved and he's
the guy who combines all these things.''
   Size, power and all-night parties are part of <PERSON>Mr. C. Personality</PERSON>
counts, too. As <PERSON>Clemons</PERSON> says, it takes someone special to play the
saxophone.
   ``You got to have an urban attitude, be a streetwise person,''
he said. ``I don't know whether the saxophone made me this kind of
person or if I was just born to play a saxophone. It's an extension
of yourself.
   ``Nobody played instruments in my family. My father got that bug
and said he wants his son to play saxophone. I wanted an electric
train for <DATE>Christmas</DATE>, but he got me a saxophone. I flipped out.''
   Clemons prides himself on being a survivor, staying around even
when music involved far more than the simple joy of playing the
sax. On tour now with <PERSON>Ringo Starr</PERSON> and a band that includes <PERSON>Joe
Walsh</PERSON>, Levon Helm and <PERSON>Rick Danko</PERSON>, <PERSON>Clemons</PERSON> is getting those old
feelings back.
   ``Every night when Levon Helm breaks into `The Weight,' I catch
myself,'' <PERSON>Clemons</PERSON> said of the Band's drummer. ``When <PERSON>Rick Danko</PERSON>
goes into his bass, I have flashbacks to when I was young and wild
and didn't understand a thing.
   ``You need to go back a little bit and remember how it was and
how screwed up it got. It was a wonderful time. This whole tour is
bringing back this stuff.''
   Clemons also reaches back on his third solo album, ``A Night
With <PERSON>Mr. C</PERSON>,'' which recalls a few other nicknames _ such as King,
as in <LOCATION>King Curtis</LOCATION>, whose sweet saxophone was featured on hits by
the Coasters, <PERSON>Sam Cooke</PERSON>, <PERSON>Aretha Franklin</PERSON> and many others; <ORGANIZATION>Clemons</ORGANIZATION>
covers <PERSON>Cooke</PERSON>'s party classic ``Twistin' the Night Away.''
   ``King Curtis is my mentor,'' <PERSON>Clemons</PERSON> said. ``I try to pattern
myself after his style. He made a live record that's one of my
favorites. `<ORGANIZATION>Memphis Soul Stew</ORGANIZATION>' and `Soul Serenade' are two songs
that made me understand the kind of music I liked.''
   Junior Walker, <ORGANIZATION>Motown</ORGANIZATION>'s hottest sax player of the '60s, is
acknowledged with <PERSON>Clemons</PERSON>' version of ``Shotgun.'' <PERSON>Clemons</PERSON> also
sings ``Quarter to Three,'' a hit for Gary ``<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>'' Bonds, and does
a duet with pop star <PERSON>Kim Carnes</PERSON> on his own ``Dance, Dance, Dance.''
   ``Singing's one of the hardest things,'' <PERSON>Clemons</PERSON> said. ``It was
terrible, the first few times.
   ``I was so depressed I went into the house and didn't come out
for six months. That still looms in the back of my mind. I sang in
the church choir and was a great singer. I felt comfortable there.''
   On stage, <PERSON>Springsteen</PERSON> loves to remember the time he and E Street
guitarist <PERSON>Steve Van Zandt</PERSON> were on the boardwalk outside a <LOCATION>New
Jersey</LOCATION> club at four in the <TIME>morning</TIME>. Through wind and pouring rain,
a large man appeared, dressed in white, carrying a saxophone.
   That, <PERSON>Clemons</PERSON> agrees, is how he and ``The Boss'' first met, back
in the early '70s _ the short, skinny guitarist and his towering
sideman. Like <PERSON>Springsteen</PERSON>, <PERSON>Clemons</PERSON> has some stories to tell. There
was the time the E Street Band appeared on the same bill as rock
'n' roll pioneers <PERSON>Chuck Berry</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jerry Lee Lewis</PERSON>.
   ``It was at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Maryland</ORGANIZATION> and we were <PERSON>Chuck Berry</PERSON>'s
band,'' <PERSON>Clemons</PERSON> recalled. ``Ten minutes before the show, no <PERSON>Chuck
Berry</PERSON>. Five minutes later he walks in with his guitar, complains
about something, and sends it back. He comes back and we walk on
stage.
   ``The bass player (<PERSON>Garry Tallent</PERSON>) walks over to him and says,
`Hey, <PERSON>Chuck</PERSON> what are we going to play?' Chuck stops and says, `I
think we're going to play some <PERSON>Chuck Berry</PERSON> music.' We played the
whole set with no rehearsal, no nothing. He never told you the next
song.''
   The rest quickly became history. By <DATE>1975</DATE>, critic <PERSON>Jon Landau</PERSON> had
dubbed <PERSON>Springsteen</PERSON> the ``future of rock 'n' roll,'' leading to
simultaneous covers on <ORGANIZATION>Time</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Newsweek</ORGANIZATION>. ``Born to Run,''
featuring <PERSON>Clemons</PERSON>' blistering solo, was an instant rock anthem,
even gathering support as the official song of <PERSON>Springsteen</PERSON>'s native
<LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION>.
   But business soon set in. Legal hassles delayed <PERSON>Springsteen</PERSON>'s
``Darkness on the Edge of Town'' album. Harsh words were exchanged
all around. The simple joy of ``Rosalita'' and ``Thunder Road'' was
gone.
   ``That was the beginning of it, that was a sign,'' <PERSON>Clemons</PERSON> said.
``The handwriting was on the wall for a lot of people, not just
<PERSON>Springsteen</PERSON>. You look at the record companies and see the turnover
in personnel and wonder what is going on.''
   So <PERSON>Clemons</PERSON> chooses to look the other way, concentrating on his
music and getting by as best he can.
   ``I tell people to get out of the business, forget about it. If
you're not really, really special, forget about it. It's glamorous
and beautiful and at the same time, it ain't. You got to have faith
and you got to have a lot of luck.''

MENTALLY ILL AND HOMELESS PEOPLE ACT OUT THEIR TROUBLES AT IMPROVISATION

<P>
Leatta woke up in a state mental hospital in <LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION> a couple of years ago and 
was told that she had gone on a rampage on a golf course. She had run around 
all 18 holes, removing the flags from the holes and tossing them on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
When she picked a song to sing before a small gathering in <LOCATION>Santa Monica</LOCATION> on a 
recent <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME>, it was <PERSON>Patsy Cline</PERSON>'s "I Fall to Pieces." 
</P>
<P>
Rodney was once found by the <ORGANIZATION>California Highway Patrol</ORGANIZATION> under his truck on the 
shoulder of the <LOCATION>San Diego Freeway</LOCATION>. He warned the officers that there were <ORGANIZATION>Viet 
Cong</ORGANIZATION> snipers in the vicinity and that they should take cover too. 
</P>
<P>
On that same <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME>, <PERSON>Rodney</PERSON> made a peace sign out of Play Doh and 
presented it to the gathering in the manner of a carnival pitchman. 
</P>
<P>
Welcome to the weekly theater-comedy improvisation workshop sponsored by Step 
Up on Second, a walk-in activity center for the mentally ill and the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all about keeping the kid in these people alive," said <PERSON>Rahla Kahn</PERSON>, an 
actress who has been giving her "playshops" -- one of the best-attended 
activities on the Step Up schedule -- for four years. "When you are a little 
kid, everything is possible. The dreams you have seem so real. For these 
people, the dreams ended a long time ago. I use improvisation games to give 
them permission to get up there and do things. 
</P>
<P>
"The goal is to get back to the curious, playful place we all once had." 
</P>
<P>
The playshop and a sketching class are the two arts programs at Step Up, a 
nonprofit organization founded in <DATE>1984</DATE> by <PERSON>Susan Dempsey</PERSON>, whose son is a 
schizophrenic. "It's a good release of emotions for the people here," said 
<PERSON>Dempsey</PERSON>, looking around the former art and picture frame warehouse on Second 
Street, now furnished with donated furniture. Step Up clients were sitting at 
tables talking, standing in line for lunch, resting on cots, looking through 
donated second-hand clothing and signing up for showers. In one corner, a man 
repeatedly played "Somewhere Out There" on an upright piano. 
</P>
<P>
"The programs make people feel good about what they do," said <PERSON>Dempsey</PERSON>, whose 
organization is supported primarily with county and federal funds. "For someone 
who might feel they are not worth anything, that's very important." 
</P>
<P>
The sketching class meets <DATE>Wednesdays</DATE> and is taught by a volunteer, <PERSON>Mary 
Mackie-Hagerth</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Pacific Palisades</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Three earnest Step Up clients joined her for a recent session and another took 
his place on a stool, quietly waiting to be drawn. Anthony, 27, went to work 
immediately, working intensely with broad strokes as he drew <PERSON>Carl</PERSON>'s face. 
Although he worked quickly, the portrait that resulted was a more than fair 
representation of <PERSON>Carl</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony stood back and looked impatiently at his drawing from several angles. 
He seemed unsure about what to do next, even after talking over the drawing 
with <PERSON>Mackie-Hagerth</PERSON>, who urged him to include more detail. 
</P>
<P>
It was important to him that he get it right. "If I can draw something, it's 
almost like I can control the world," said <PERSON>Anthony</PERSON>, who lives in <LOCATION>Santa Monica</LOCATION>. 
"You can create your own little worlds. If you get really good at it, other 
people will look at what you have done and they can enter into the world you 
have created." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Helen</PERSON>, who wore a wool cap and a flowered dress, kept up a steady stream of 
comic patter as she drew, sometimes lapsing into a mock Russian accent to get a 
laugh. It was not possible to get a straight answer out of her. 
</P>
<P>
How long has she been in the class? 
</P>
<P>
"I've been in a class of my own all my life," <PERSON>Helen</PERSON> retorted with a sense of 
timing that <PERSON>Groucho Marx</PERSON> would have admired. 
</P>
<P>
In her younger years, she was a comedian, she said, and her patter is full of 
references to writers and performers. It was apparent by her multicolored 
portrait of <PERSON>Carl</PERSON> that she has also had experience in drawing, but she seemed 
most interested in entertaining her classmates. 
</P>
<P>
"This girl was beautiful ballerina in old country," <PERSON>Helen</PERSON> vamped, gesturing 
toward <PERSON>Melanie</PERSON>, who was quietly drawing next to her. "Now she is great 
artiste." 
</P>
<P>
Melanie, a diminutive, soft-spoken young woman, laughed shyly. "She is good for 
my ego," <PERSON>Melanie</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Melanie</PERSON>, who works as a pet groomer, fashioned a portrait of <PERSON>Carl</PERSON> in dark gray 
and peach. She had not drawn before she joined the class a year and a half ago. 
"When I started, you couldn't tell male from female when I drew a face," she 
said. "Then you start to get it. I practiced at home. I keep a book of drawings 
and watch my progress." 
</P>
<P>
The portrait captured a pensive look in <PERSON>Carl</PERSON>'s eyes. Melanie worked in details 
with a sure hand. 
</P>
<P>
"I think she could sell her work," <PERSON>Mackie-Hagerth</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
A tall, gregarious man, who is a client of Step Up but not in the class, walked 
over to watch her draw. Then he spoke to <PERSON>Carl</PERSON>. "You never looked better, young 
man," he said. "This woman has put a magic wand to this painting." 
</P>
<P>
Melanie blushed a bit, but she also beamed. 
</P>
<P>
The quiet of the sketch class was in sharp contrast to the rambunctiousness of 
the <DATE>Saturday</DATE> improvisation session later that same week, which was attended by 
18 Step Up clients. <PERSON>Kahn</PERSON> began it, as she always does, with everyone standing 
in a circle, singing the <PERSON>Rodgers</PERSON> and <PERSON>Hammerstein</PERSON> standard "Getting to Know 
You." 
</P>
<P>
The scene was nothing like her first visit to Step Up in <DATE>1985</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Kahn</PERSON>, who believes in Norman Cousins' widely promoted theory that laughter can 
have a therapeutic effect, was filling in for a friend who routinely showed 
comedy videos at Step Up to raise the spirits of clients. "I pushed the little 
video cart around and showed the tapes," <PERSON>Kahn</PERSON> remembered, "and they were 
literally falling asleep on me as they watched them. I thought, 'Screw this.' I 
got them off their butts and doing things. I knew all these theater games, and 
they loved them." 
</P>
<P>
When <PERSON>Dempsey</PERSON> saw how <PERSON>Kahn</PERSON> sparked the Step Up people, she asked her to do a 
class on a weekly basis, for which <PERSON>Kahn</PERSON> gets a weekly honorarium of <MONEY>$50</MONEY>. "It's 
not much, but I needed to get a little something," said <PERSON>Kahn</PERSON>, who recently quit 
her job at an advertising agency to concentrate on her acting career. 
</P>
<P>
After "Getting to Know You," she had the group play a game called "Oh, Great 
One," in which the participants take turns being the wisest person in the 
universe. The others ask questions, to which the "Great One" must answer with 
the first word that comes to mind. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, Great One, why are you a vegetarian?" 
</P>
<P>
"Love," answered <PERSON>Nina</PERSON>, a 60-year-old grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, Great One, what does theater mean to you?" 
</P>
<P>
"Greatness," answered <PERSON>Anthony</PERSON>, who later said he would like to be an actor. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, Great One, what is freedom?" 
</P>
<P>
"Lost," answered <PERSON>Rodney</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
Rodney, a <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> veteran, has been trying to put his life back together since 
that day when the <ORGANIZATION>CHP</ORGANIZATION> officer found him under his truck on the freeway. He said 
he was on his way to work when he reached a bend in the road that reminded him 
of where he used to drive in a jungle convoy. <PERSON>Rodney</PERSON> said he flashed back, 
thinking he was back in the war. He was released after a stay in a Veterans 
Administration hospital, but he is still haunted by the fear that he will flash 
back again. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't sleep much," said <PERSON>Rodney</PERSON>, who started out the playshop in a polo shirt 
but soon changed to his customary <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> camouflage shirt. "I take pills to knock 
me out. I'm afraid I'll dream and go back. 
</P>
<P>
"Coming to this gets me out of my shell. I get a rush from this." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Kahn</PERSON> asked everyone to take an everyday object or a Play Doh creation, and sell 
it like it was a great invention. 
</P>
<P>
Toward the end of the playshop came everyone's activity, singing. One by one, 
the participants took the microphone in hand, some delivering their songs with 
grand gestures, others more sedately. 
</P>
<P>
Bill, an intense man, hardly moved anything but his mouth as he sang a terse 
version of "Old Man River." Phil sang "Home on the Range" complete with animal 
imitations; <PERSON>Chris</PERSON> got into her version of "Somewhere Out There"; <PERSON>Tom</PERSON> put a lot 
of heart into the old <PERSON>Herman</PERSON>'s Hermits hit "I'm Henry the VIII, I Am"; <PERSON>Helen</PERSON> 
worked the room with a Yiddish song, and <ORGANIZATION>Nina</ORGANIZATION> had everyone join in on "God 
Bless America." 
</P>
<P>
Leatta, whose life has been like a country and Western song -- bad marriages, 
abandonment, beatings -- sang "I Fall to Pieces" sweetly, with a tear in her 
voice. She has been singing since she was a young girl, occasionally with 
bands, and would like to return to performing. Until recently, her home was a 
tent in the back of a bar, but she now lives at <ORGANIZATION>Daybreak</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Santa Monica</LOCATION> center 
that provides transitional housing for women with a history of mental illness. 
With her life becoming more stable, she dreams of getting back into performing. 
</P>
<P>
"If I ever did make it big, half of what I make would go into buying land and 
putting up houses for homeless people," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Kahn greatly encourages the playshop participants to dream of better times. "I 
believe in this kind of stuff. I think I own every book ever put out by <PERSON>Dale 
Carnegie</PERSON>," she said later, with a laugh, over coffee. 
</P>
<P>
But is it dangerous to encourage their dreams? Could it lead to inflating the 
hopes of a fragile person? 
</P>
<P>
"I think about that," she said. "But I believe in the word hope. Not that I 
tell them they are going to become rich and big stars or anything like that. 
But I don't think it's bad to give Leatta permission to sing again. Would it be 
better just to take her dreams away? 
</P>
<P>
"What's important are the little moments, right now. When they are walking down 
the street, feeling bummed out about what has happened to them, I want them to 
think about how good they felt at the playshop." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Kahn</PERSON> has dreams of her own that she freely shared with her playshop. She 
unabashedly wants a role in a sitcom and spends her weekdays going to auditions 
and meetings. But she said that even if she is successful, she will continue 
with the playshops. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't do this just for them," she said. "Even when it's rough, I get 
something out of coming here too. When I've had a rough week and haven't gotten 
any callbacks, I'm the one who thinks of the playshop." 
</P>
<P>
Near the end of the playshop, it was time for Tom to sing his song. He had said 
almost nothing during the two-hour session and when he had, it was in a quiet, 
gentle voice. He too had once been a performer and had had a hard life. 
</P>
<P>
Tom sat in front of the microphone, a guitar in his lap, for several seconds 
before he began to quietly strum it like a ukulele. Then, without any 
performance mannerisms, he sang the <DATE>1950s</DATE> hit "Love Letters in the Sand." 
</P>
<P>
Tom's innocent interpretation of the song had none of the sappiness of the <PERSON>Pat 
Boone</PERSON> original. No one in the playshop made a sound as he sang. 
</P>
<P>
When it was over, the applause, whoops and whistles were loud and rousing. Kahn 
stepped up and touched him on the shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
"You're shaking," she said to him, quickly drawing her hand away like she had 
touched something hot. 
</P>
<P>
"I know," he said in a quivering voice, and then he managed a shy smile. 
</P>
<P>
"Did you hear that applause, did you hear what they did at the end of your 
song?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah," he said, the smile growing broader. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, <PERSON>Tom</PERSON>," she said, putting her hand back on his shoulder. "That was for 
you."

<LEADPARA>  THE instruments may have been subdued -- but the sound definitely wasn't.;  
For two hours the Subdudes kept the audience at the Great American Music Hall

amazing thing was that they did it with the most unlikely instruments: an
accordion, an acoustic guitar, an electric bass and a tambourine.  </LEADPARA>

<MEMO>  Music Review  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     That's right: A tambourine.;   Unlikely highlight; There were a lot of
highlights during this excellent show, but for a Subdudes first-timer, that
tambourine may be the thing most talked about. <PERSON>Steve Amedee</PERSON> played it like a
rock 'n' roll drum set. He hit it with sticks and got a full sound out of it
that -- and I'm not exaggerating here -- rivaled drummers in recent
performances by Guns N' Roses and AC/DC.;   During his solo on "Light in Your
Eyes," I had to walk up to the front of the stage to make sure he hadn't
somehow hidden a drum set under his chair. I didn't think you could get that
many sounds out of a tambourine. He did.;   The rest of the 'Dudes had their
tricks, too. With impeccable rhythms, soaring harmonies and a treasure chest
of original songs, guitarist <PERSON>Tommy Malone</PERSON>, bassist <PERSON>Johnny Ray Allen</PERSON> and <PERSON>John
Magnie</PERSON> on the accordion and keyboards played music that made you have to
dance. You couldn't sit still, even during the ballads, because of their hot
Cajun spice.;   The 18-song set drew evenly from their first two albums, both
of which feature songwriting that's so strong, you feel like you've heard
every song before. I kept thinking the show's opener, "One Time," or "Any
Cure" or "Push and Shove" must have been bayou classics passed down through
the ages.;   But they are all originals and all refined over seven years of
playing in clubs.;   They did three songs by other people: <PERSON>Al Green</PERSON>'s "Tired
of Being Alone" and <PERSON>Earl King</PERSON>'s "Nighttime" and "Big Chief." They kicked out
the jams on a long version of "Chief," adding some psychedelic keyboards to
the accordion and rock 'n' roll kazoo.;   On songs off their second, more
electric album, "Lucky," <PERSON>Malone</PERSON> played a lead guitar mounted on a stand, while
his acoustic hung around his neck. Those songs, including "I Can't Wait" and
"Another Heartbreak Now," came off better in concert than on record. The songs
stretched out into soulful jams; the music had more of a rhythm-and-blues
flavor than the acoustic numbers.;   I wouldn't want to see the Subdudes go
all electric, but they showed they could produce entirely different moods and
compete with more traditional rock bands. On "Straight Shot," they sounded
like the Band. At one point during "It's So Hard," they sounded like the old
<ORGANIZATION>Doobie Brothers.</ORGANIZATION>;   Still, what they did with acoustic instruments was what
made the <TIME>night</TIME>. With all of them huddled around <PERSON>Amedee</PERSON>'s tambourine chair,
they got a kind of electricity and energy from a simple array of instruments
that I haven't heard since rock 'n' rollers began plugging into giant <PERSON>Marshall</PERSON>
amps.;   Inexplicably obscure; The really amazing thing is that the 'Dudes are
still playing clubs, drawing only about 200 people on a <DATE>Sunday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>. The only
comparable tour I can think of was in <DATE>1979</DATE>, when an unknown trio called the
Police did a late-winter club tour and played their white reggae to a lot of
sparse houses, some sparser than usual because of blizzards.;   Even though
only about 100 people saw them in <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION>, over the years thousands of people
claimed to have seen that show.;   If there is any rock 'n' roll justice,
someday people will be saying the same thing about the Subdudes in <LOCATION>San
Francisco</LOCATION>.  </TEXT>

<MEMO>  MUSIC  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     There's <PERSON>Ranger Doug</PERSON>, the square-jawed, straight-shootin' Idol of American
Youth; Too Slim, "the man of many hats and a dozen friends"; and <PERSON>Woody Paul</PERSON>,
"the man with an 8-gallon head in a 10-gallon hat.";   They're a tumbleweed
trio who mix campfire camp with some of the sweetest cowboy harmonies either
side of the <LOCATION>Brazos River.</LOCATION>;   Now, more than a dozen years and 2,400 shows
after hittin' the trail, they're riding high in the saddle with "Riders Radio
Theater," a half-hour show carried on nearly 200 stations; a new album on a
new (and bigger) label; and a kids' show making its debut <DATE>Saturday</DATE> on CBS
(Chs. 5, 46, <TIME>7 a.m.</TIME>).;   So long state fairs, helloooo Hollywood.;   Lots of
learnin'; Behind the prairie parodies and muley melodies are three
over-educated cowpokes with a genuine fondness for the Old West. (Too Slim has
a bachelor's degree in wildlife management, <PERSON>Ranger Doug</PERSON> a master's in English
from <LOCATION>Vanderbilt</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Woody Paul</PERSON> -- hold on to your Resistol -- a doctorate in
nuclear physics from <ORGANIZATION>MIT</ORGANIZATION>.);   Besides superfluous sheepskin, they share a love
of the music immortalized by the stars of '30s and <DATE>'40s</DATE> "B" Westerns -- <PERSON>Tex
Ritter</PERSON>, <PERSON>Gene Autry</PERSON>, the Sons of the Pioneers and, of course, the Father of the
Sons, <PERSON>Roy Rogers.</PERSON>;   Back at the Triple X <ORGANIZATION>Ranch</ORGANIZATION>, Too Slim, "the little man
with the big instrument," plays bunkhouse bass. He sings lead tenor and does a
mean <PERSON>Gabby Hayes</PERSON> geezer. Ranger <PERSON>Doug</PERSON>, who plays guitar, has a honey-throated
baritone and a No. 6 yodel that could stop a jackrabbit at 20 paces. Tenor
<PERSON>Woody Paul</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>King of the Cowboy Fiddlers</ORGANIZATION>, has the fastest lasso in the West.;  
Together, they can croon the socks off a <LOCATION>Salina</LOCATION> schoolmarm with their
arrangements of "Cool Water," "Tumbling Tumbleweeds" and "Happy Trails." Their
original numbers evoke wide-open spaces: "Pretty Prairie Princess," "West
Texas Cowboy," "The Salting of the Slug.";   But what's that you say? Cowboy
music is nothing more than another Hollywood merchandising gimmick? A
sterilized, ethnocentric portrayal of Manifest Destiny?;   C'mon, get a life,
little dogie.;   "Cowboys have captured our romantic fantasies in the way that
lumberjacks and sheep shearers never did," says <PERSON>Ranger Doug</PERSON>, author of several
books on country music and <ORGANIZATION>Country Music Foundation</ORGANIZATION> historian. "There have
been cowboy songs and poems for well over a hundred years.";   The Riders
don't just paint pretty pictures with their songs.;   There are the lessons in
frontier history, such as how the yodel was born (hint: it involves an abrupt
encounter with a saddle horn). And helpful trail tips.;   Riders cater to the
contemporary cowpuncher, as well. Standing in the stirrups got you all
stressed out? Try "Bio Feedbag," the antidote to "bronco burnout.";   All this
and more, brought to you in part by Deadwood <PERSON>Darlene</PERSON>'s Prairie Lubricants,
whose products include Udder Butter on a Rope.;   Yes, fame and big-name
sponsors may finally have found Riders in the Sky. But how did they find each
other?;   It was <DATE>1977</DATE>, and "all three of us were living in <LOCATION>Nashville</LOCATION>," says
<PERSON>Ranger Doug</PERSON>. "There were a million bands and four-chord songs and outlaws and
the big electric bass and drums and broken hearts and broken marriages and
feeling sorry for yourself and gettin' drunk. Not that there's anything wrong
with that, you understand.";   But?;   "But cowboy music was such a delightful
alternative to all that.";   Too Slim and <PERSON>Ranger Doug</PERSON> had been playing local
club gigs together. But Riders came down the chute, <ORGANIZATION>Ranger Doug</ORGANIZATION> says, "when
<PERSON>Woody</PERSON> came along and said, 'You boys really need me,' in his typical modest
way.";   Like an armadillo needs an armpit?;   "Well, musically, he may have
been correct," allows <ORGANIZATION>Ranger Doug.</ORGANIZATION>;   Another thing they had going for them
was a wide-open niche: Singing cowboys had pretty much vamoosed by the 1950s.;
  Spurred on by a small stock of original trail tunes, quick-witted wrangler
repartee and some of the coolest cowboy outfits ever whipstitched together,
Riders in the Sky answered the call of the wild.;   <ORGANIZATION>Douglas Green</ORGANIZATION> became
<PERSON>Ranger Doug</PERSON>, defender of women, protector of children and friend to small
animals from the <LOCATION>Great Plains</LOCATION> to the <LOCATION>Grand Canyon</LOCATION>; <PERSON>Fred LaBour</PERSON> filled the
boots of Too Slim, varmint dancer and cagey cayuse who almost always needs
reining in; and <PERSON>Paul Woodrow Chrisman</PERSON> is <PERSON>Woody Paul</PERSON>, the childlike innocent
you reckon' got one mule kick in the head too many.;   It's paid off. What
could be more reward than a stall in the Grand Ol' Opry (awarded almost a
decade ago), the <DATE>1985</DATE> Independent Label Children's Album of the Year (for
"Saddle Pals"), or last year's outstanding achievement award from the Cowboy
<PERSON>Hall</PERSON> of Fame (for <ORGANIZATION>Ranger Doug</ORGANIZATION>'s original tune, "The Line Rider")?;   Well,
maybe the legion of buckaroos and buckarettes who follow the Riders' every
misadventure. Or the buckle bunnies from <LOCATION>Cheyenne</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Chisholm</LOCATION>, eternally
hopeful for just one chance to rope and tie the knot with Ranger Doug.;   But
before setting up home on the range, the Riders have some important business
to tend to.;   They're still taping their new TV show, "Riders in the Sky," a
Wild West version of "Pee-wee's Playhouse" featuring puppets, cartoons,
real-live Saddle Pals and musical performances.;   There's talk of other TV
ventures, even movies.;   Get out of <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION>; But for the moment, "it's all
just talk," says <PERSON>Ranger Doug</PERSON>. "This is Hollywood, and there's a lot of hot
air. This town probably floats 20 feet above sea level on hot air.";   So when
they wrap up the show for the season, it's back on the road, this time with
material from their new children's album, "Harmony Ranch" (<ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION>).;   Sure,
they could hang around the ranch and wait for stardom to come knocking. But
Riders in the Sky hold true to their credo.;   "That would be the easy way.
But it wouldn't be the cowboy way."  </TEXT>

<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's called ``Snake music'' _ <ORGANIZATION>Delta</ORGANIZATION>
blues shot through with rock riffs and punchy drumming.
   And if the drummer gives the beat a soulful touch, it's because
he once played for Aretha Franklin.
   The band is the Snakes, who have released their self-titled
debut album amid comparisons to the Fabulous Thunderbirds. The
group, composed of veteran recording session musicians, plays a
tight mix of original and reworked blues and rock 'n' roll tunes.
   The connection to the Fabulous Thunderbirds doesn't end with the
sound. Snakes pianist <PERSON>Wally Wilson</PERSON> co-wrote the Thunderbirds' hit
``Powerful Stuff,'' featured in the soundtrack for the movie
``Cocktail.''
   <PERSON>Wilson</PERSON>, who is also a veteran country music and rock songwriter,
says the band didn't plan for the new LP to sound like the
Thunderbirds, but he likes the comparison.
   The album contains Snakes' versions of two songs by the late
blues legends <PERSON>Robert Johnson</PERSON> and <PERSON>Bukka White</PERSON>: <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON>'s ``32-20''
and <PERSON>White</PERSON>'s ``Aberdeen,'' a marriage of acoustic <ORGANIZATION>Delta</ORGANIZATION> blues and
hard-edged rock. It also features ``Walkaway,'' heard on the
soundtrack for the movie ``Major League.''
   Perhaps the most unusual tune on the <ORGANIZATION>LP</ORGANIZATION> is ``Pay <PERSON>Bo Diddley</PERSON>,'' a
humorous but scathing look at how the famous rock 'n' roll pioneer
was cheated out of royalties by smooth talking record company
executives.
   Wilson persuaded <PERSON>Diddley</PERSON> to come to <LOCATION>Nashville</LOCATION> to sing and play
guitar on the cut.
   ``When we brought him up here to do the session, he loved it,''
<PERSON>Wilson</PERSON> said. ``It was his song. He was king for a day.''
   <PERSON>Wilson</PERSON> adds that he had to wire half of the cash fee for the
session to <PERSON>Diddley</PERSON> at his <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> home before the performer would
come to <LOCATION>Nashville</LOCATION>. He was paid the other half, in cash of course,
once he arrived.
   Recording an album wasn't on the minds of founding members
<PERSON>Wilson</PERSON> and guitarist-vocalist <PERSON>Mike Henderson</PERSON> when they met and
began playing the blues in <LOCATION>Nashville</LOCATION>.
   ``We decided we would get the <PERSON>Mike</PERSON> and <PERSON>Wally</PERSON> show together and
play Holiday Inns and places like that,'' <PERSON>Wilson</PERSON> joked.
   ``We got a four-piece band together to play <DATE>Monday</DATE> nights at the
Bluebird (Cafe),'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION>Bluebird</ORGANIZATION> is known as a breeding
ground for new talent and many artists have been signed to their
first recording contracts after appearing there.
   At first the Snakes played to an audience consisting mainly of
waitresses, but in time college students and members of the music
industry became fans.
   ``Pretty soon ... it was jam packed in there,'' <PERSON>Wilson</PERSON> said.
   He credits that success to the combination of original members
<PERSON>Henderson</PERSON>, bassist <PERSON>Glenn Worf</PERSON> and drummer <PERSON>Bill Swartz</PERSON>. But as the
group's sound began to evolve from straight blues to blues-rock,
guitarist <PERSON>Kenny Greenberg</PERSON> was added and <PERSON>Swartz</PERSON> was replaced by
veteran rhythm and blues drummer <PERSON>James Stroud</PERSON>.
   The lineup started playing more clubs in <LOCATION>Nashville</LOCATION> and attracted
the attention of <ORGANIZATION>Curb Records</ORGANIZATION> executive <PERSON>Dick Whitehouse</PERSON>, who signed
them to a record deal.
   The effortless dovetailing of the musicians' styles is the
reason for their success, <PERSON>Wilson</PERSON> says.
   ``Kenny is an incredible rock guitarist. When he came here (from
<LOCATION>Louisville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ky.</LOCATION>,) he was going to play country. That lasted about
two days,'' said <PERSON>Wilson</PERSON>, who migrated to <LOCATION>Nashville</LOCATION> from <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> and
started as a janitor at a music publishing company.
   ``Kenny is the leading guy in this part of the South for playing
rock 'n' roll. He has been featured in Guitar Player magazine. He's
done a lot of album work.''
   Wilson characterizes <PERSON>Worf</PERSON> as the best musician in the band.
``Glenn is an incredible bass player. He is very musical. He could
be a jazz musician.''
   Stroud also is a record producer and has drummed for such greats
as Aretha Franklin. Henderson grew up listening to the blues. He
usually sings and plays the harmonica wearing an old <ORGANIZATION>Esso</ORGANIZATION> service
station attendant's shirt and a battered straw cowboy hat.
   ``He is the strangest guy I've ever met. All of his clothes are
second hand,'' <PERSON>Wilson</PERSON> said. ``He thinks it's ridiculous for people
to pay more than <MONEY>$20</MONEY> for an article of clothing. If you see him in
a suit, it will be a <MONEY>$10</MONEY> suit.''

FT  24 JUL 93 / Travel: Island-hopping through the South Seas - John
Westbrooke watches coconuts grow on the Cook Islands, meets friendly Fijians
and studies serious rugby-playing Samoans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WESTBROOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IS THERE no such word as 'Pacificism'? Maybe we should invent it, to
describe the hold the South Seas have on our imaginations. 'Orientalism,'
after all, is the way we construct a myth of the east. But the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION>
islands play as big a part in our dreams of paradise. Just think of <LOCATION>Gauguin</LOCATION>,
<PERSON>Robert Louis Stevenson</PERSON>, grass skirts, blue lagoons. We need a word for all
this <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> dreaming.
Tahiti is probably the place most people think of as an island nirvana
(except Americans, who think of <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>). <LOCATION>Moorea</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Bora Bora</ORGANIZATION> fit every
requirement: cloud-capped peaks, steep green slopes tumbling to golden
sands, coral reefs with white waves outside and calm pale blue water within.
The natives are friendly francophones - this is French Polynesia, baguettes
and yellow headlights. They beguiled poor Captain <PERSON>Bligh</PERSON>'s men into mutinying
so that The Bounty could stay a while longer. Their happy promiscuity had
long been suppressed by missionaries by the time <PERSON>Gauguin</PERSON> was drawn there,
which is probably just as well, otherwise <LOCATION>Papeete</LOCATION> would be the <LOCATION>Bangkok</LOCATION> of
the <LOCATION>South Pacific</LOCATION>. But while women no longer swim out naked to greet sailing
ships, new arrivals at the airport will be welcomed with leis and ukulele
music.
Sometimes it is hard to look on all this natural beauty without wondering
whether tourists do it any good, and hearing in your mind's ear <ORGANIZATION>Big Yellow
Taxi</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Joni Mitchell</PERSON>'s lament for <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>: 'You don't know what you've got
till it's gone, They paved paradise and put up a parking lot.'
A common feature of the beach hotels, for instance, is bungalows built
ostentatiously over shallow water and containing glass coffee tables through
which you can watch and even feed vivid tropical fish from the comfort of
your living room. At one such hotel we saw sand being pumped in from the
next bay to improve the beach. Ecologically sound, we were assured; but it
does not seem right.
By way of an awful ecological warning, there are the <LOCATION>Bali</LOCATION> Hyatt Ruins on
<ORGANIZATION>Bora Bora</ORGANIZATION>, half-built on a hill when the rains washed the land away and the
money ran out. The Tahitians know their <PERSON>Joni Mitchell</PERSON>, and promise that
their island will not go the way of <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>. Bora Bora will not go the way of
<LOCATION>Tahiti</LOCATION>. Huahine will not go the way of <LOCATION>Bora Bora</LOCATION>. I hope they are right. And
Hyatt (which denies any connection with the ruins) merits some sort of
sensitivity prize for its <ORGANIZATION>Regency Hotel</ORGANIZATION>, which clings so modestly to a
hillside outside <LOCATION>Papeete</LOCATION> you can hardly see it.
FOR an equally <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> and much less touristy experience, fly a few hundred
miles west to the <ORGANIZATION>Cook Islands</ORGANIZATION>. In this easy-going backwater people speak
English, drive on the left and wave to strangers; and the towns look like
rural <LOCATION>New Zealand</LOCATION>. The best hotel in the islands, the <LOCATION>Rarotongan Resort</LOCATION>, is
nobody's idea of luxury, but it has beaches and island nights where the
vigorous local music and dancing are on display.
And again, you are in blue lagoon country. A day trip to <LOCATION>Aitutaki</LOCATION>, one of
the neighbouring atolls, must rank high among the world's best: barbecues
under the palms, snorkeling over the coral, white sand between your toes.
There is a prosaic explanation for the palm-fringed beaches: coconuts wash
ashore, and seeds sprout at the high-water mark. Knowing this does not make
them any less idyllic.
Though the islands were named after <PERSON>James Cook</PERSON>, the first Europeans to see
them were Spanish, in <DATE>1595</DATE>. A <ORGANIZATION>Spanish Polynesia</ORGANIZATION> never developed, but the
notion is a pleasing one: corridas in which matadors throw leis round the
bulls' necks, perhaps, and a redoubled respect for manana. These days the
<ORGANIZATION>Cook Islands</ORGANIZATION>' main connection is with <LOCATION>New Zealand</LOCATION>, in a Monegasque
arrangement whereby the islands are self-governing but <LOCATION>Wellington</LOCATION> provides
defence and a lot of aid.
ANOTHER short flight takes you on to the islands of <LOCATION>Western Samoa</LOCATION>, which is
a different sort of place. You can see it at once on the airport road, in
the vivid gardens, covered in black rocks, rootling pigs and the occasional
family grave; in the 100 churches in 20 miles; and in the way most people
don't live in houses.
Instead they have a fale - a floor and a palm-frond roof, separated only by
poles. If it is too hot or cold or wet or windy, blinds are let down, but
there are no walls and only basic furniture.
Stevenson lived, died and is buried on a hill outside <LOCATION>Apia</LOCATION>. Somerset Maugham
(who set Rain in nearby American Samoa) would be at home in the sunny,
slightly seedy capital, too: you might find him observing the crowd in a
bar, while <PERSON>Paul Theroux</PERSON> sits next to him muttering into his beer. He would
be staying at <ORGANIZATION>Aggie Grey's</ORGANIZATION>, a burger bar which grew into one of the great
colonial hotels and has recently been brightly refurbished.
Western <LOCATION>Samoa</LOCATION> feels unwestern. People are friendly enough, but <PERSON>Theroux</PERSON> is
not the only foreigner to have found a sort of teasing hostility in small
villages. The country was the first Pacific island to achieve independence,
in <DATE>1962</DATE>, after decades of often oppressive rule by <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New Zealand</LOCATION>;
and Samoans are proud of it.
But independence comes at a price. Agriculture and fishing provide little
money. The banana trade was brought to its knees by bad weather and erratic
shipping, and mostly lost to central <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>. Tourism is one of the biggest
businesses, though it is not very big. The locals might look content but
many are unemployed, and remittances from those who leave home are a big
source of income.
Samoans are their own people, but they hold a special place in the western
imagination, too, thanks to <PERSON>Margaret Mead</PERSON>'s Coming of Age in <LOCATION>Samoa</LOCATION> (drawn
from <LOCATION>American Samoa</LOCATION>), suggesting that, for Samoans, growing up could be free
of trauma and sex free of guilt. Her findings have been hotly disputed and
certainly aren't true now, but they are a prime example of Pacificism, the
attributing of a better life to a far-off place.
IN <LOCATION>FIJI</LOCATION>, you are back with the tourists. Not so long ago <LOCATION>Fiji</LOCATION> was the dark
side of the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> myth. Lots of south sea islanders ate people, but the
Fijians seem to have pursued their cuisine with unusual gusto; startled
visitors had their buttocks fondled as they arrived, to check for fat
content. Bligh passed through these waters, hastily and without landing, the
locals hot on his heels.
But the missionaries were as successful here as anywhere else. Fijians are
now devout Christians, and the singing of a church choir will weaken your
knees. Violence is not unknown - we watched a village rugby match end after
10 minutes, with a man carried off and the opposing team facing suspension
for the season - but tourists are no longer in danger.
If they do not come it may be for another reason: politics. In <DATE>1987</DATE>, the
army overthrew the elected government and set out to limit the influence of
Indians, originally brought in by Europeans to work the cane fields but now
almost outnumbering the natives. <LOCATION>Fiji</LOCATION> isn't <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>, and the races seem
to co-exist, but the tensions between them are an unwelcome reminder that,
even in paradise, some angels may be more equal than others.
Liberal travellers are used to seeing locals worse off than themselves (if
you want a wealthy <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> island try <LOCATION>Nauru</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>Saudi Arabia</LOCATION> of guano), but
the sight of inequality being imposed, and the thought of the military doing
it, may make some of them prefer to holiday elsewhere.
They would be missing something if they did. Hard up against the date line,
<LOCATION>Fiji</LOCATION> claims to be the first country in the world. The sun pours down. The
people are friendly, without fondling your buttocks. The palm trees are
forbidden to grow lower than the hotels. The reefs teem with lurid fish.
The blue lagoons. . . well, both Blue Lagoons, the <PERSON>Jean Simmons</PERSON> one and the
<PERSON>Brooke Shields</PERSON> re-make, were filmed around <LOCATION>Yasawa</LOCATION>, a string of islands at
the west end. We stayed at the <LOCATION>Yasawa Island Lodge</LOCATION> in big, bright bungalows
amid vegetation so lush it was hard to believe it had been devastated by a
cyclone only last <DATE>January</DATE>. (The cyclone-free southern winter is the time to
visit).
At the east end of <LOCATION>Fiji</LOCATION>, famous for its glottal stops, we stopped at Matagi
island, which specialises in diving; you can spend the days among some of
the world's richest coral walls and the evenings chatting about tables and
bommies, or swim under waterfalls on neighbouring <LOCATION>Taveuni</LOCATION> and look out at
night for the cane toads.
You can fly between islands - atolls look particularly beautiful from the
air - or take a cruise, or stay at a hotel and luxuriate. And whenever you
leave, the locals will sing <PERSON>Isa Lei</PERSON>, the haunting Fijian song of farewell.
<PERSON>John Westbrooke</PERSON> travelled as a guest of <ORGANIZATION>Air New Zealand</ORGANIZATION>. Frommer, <ORGANIZATION>Fodor</ORGANIZATION> and
<PERSON>Moon</PERSON> publish guidebooks to the region; Lonely Planet devotes one to each
island.

THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS: POUNDING POP TO A PULP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Pursuit of Happiness is no revolutionary rock band, but it is one worth 
rallying around for listeners who think that a catchy melody and a hammering 
beat is a pop fan's inalienable right. 
</P>
<P>
The strength of the Canadian band's show <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> at the <ORGANIZATION>Coach House</ORGANIZATION> in 
<LOCATION>San Juan Capistrano</LOCATION> was its ability, time and again, to send a capsule of 
captivating melody into orbit on the shoulders of a booster-rocket instrumental 
surge. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, by overplaying its strength, the band turned it into a flaw. Like space 
launches, those catchy pop blast-offs became a little routine with successful 
repetition, no matter how magnificent they might be when taken individually. It 
would have helped if the Pursuit of Happiness, which plays again <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> at 
<ORGANIZATION>Bogart</ORGANIZATION>'s in <LOCATION>Long Beach</LOCATION>, slowed the pace from time to time, instead of making 
nearly everything hurtle ahead at full thrust. Even a band with the power to 
launch moon shots should occasionally take a hint from that old 
declaration-signer, <PERSON>Ben Franklin</PERSON>, and realize that sometimes you can get 
electrifying results just by flying a kite. 
</P>
<P>
The band's single-mindedness about rocking out led to stretches of sameness 
during the 80-minute set, and the emphasis on muscle led to a sound mix that 
sometimes obscured the shine on the band's harmony-glazed pop hooks. But if the 
Pursuit of Happiness can be criticized for following a formula to excess, it's 
only fair to appreciate how much fun that formula is. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Moe Berg</PERSON>, who sings, writes the band's songs and plays lead guitar, has an 
Everyman rock voice -- a little nasal, a little flat, a little thin. But 
bright, Bangles-quality harmonies from <PERSON>Kris Abbott</PERSON> and <PERSON>Leslie Stanwyck</PERSON> 
cushioned <PERSON>Berg</PERSON>'s voice and balanced out a slashing, driving instrumental attack 
that featured <PERSON>Berg</PERSON>'s raw but concise guitar solos. If the band fell into 
sameness from song to song, it achieved a nice sense of proportion and 
development within individual tunes. 
</P>
<P>
Some of <ORGANIZATION>Berg</ORGANIZATION>'s lyrics got lost in the din, but they are another strength. 
Essentially, <PERSON>Berg</PERSON> has one subject, summed up by the title of the band's debut 
album, "Love Junk." But he addresses matters of the heart and loins with wit 
and comes at them from shifting perspectives and odd angles, ranging from crude 
to jarring to winningly innocent. 
</P>
<P>
The band interspersed five new songs in a set that included all of "Love Junk," 
plus a jukebox encore of <ORGANIZATION>Mountain</ORGANIZATION>'s "Mississippi Queen," <PERSON>Badfinger</PERSON>'s "No Matter 
What," and <PERSON>Elvis Presley</PERSON>'s "Little Sister." The new material followed the style 
of "Love Junk" rather than exploring new directions. 
</P>
<P>
The Pursuit of Happiness was happily free from pretensions. <PERSON>Berg</PERSON>, with his 
wire-frame glasses, long stringy hair and high forehead, looks as if he could 
as easily be a computer hacker as a rocker; between songs, he was a friendly 
host who addressed the audience as "folks" and talked wryly about such things 
as old high-school jealousies and his new Three Stooges T-shirt (it featured 
<PERSON>Larry</PERSON>, rather than <PERSON>Berg</PERSON>'s namesake, <LOCATION>Moe</LOCATION>). Even backup singer <PERSON>Stanwyck</PERSON>, the 
band's only source of glamour, was unassuming in her sultry way. Instead of 
dancing like a performer, with video-choreographed steps, she danced with the 
natural movements of a fan caught up in the music pouring from a powerful band. 
</P>
<P>
Middle act Legal Rein may not cast melodic hooks quite as tastily baited as the 
Pursuit of Happiness', but the <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> band played a grabbing set that 
displayed an impressive range -- from noisy, spirited bashing a la the 
Replacements to topical folk balladry, anthem rock and an atmospheric, 
strikingly original remake of the Beatles' "Dear Prudence" that was alternately 
crashing and delicate. A band to watch. 
</P>
<P>
One Day's opening set was capably played and well-received, but the local band 
still seems bogged down in musical territory already staked out by <ORGANIZATION>R.E.M.</ORGANIZATION> and 
the Smithereens. A wider range of feelings might help: while One Day played 
with bite, <PERSON>Alan Dugan</PERSON>'s singing had an unvaryingly tremulous quality that 
limited the band.

POP BEAT / MIKE BOEHM: KOTTKE FINDS A VOICE AGAIN AFTER 8 YEARS OF PURE PICKIN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Mike Boehm 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
<PERSON>Leo Kottke</PERSON> has spent most of the <DATE>1980s</DATE> making records with his fingers, just as 
he did in the late <DATE>1960s</DATE> and early '70s, when he established himself as an 
acoustic guitar virtuoso. 
</P>
<P>
But with his strong new album, "My Father's Face," <PERSON>Kottke</PERSON> -- who shares a bill 
with <PERSON>Lyle Lovett</PERSON> tonight at the Celebrity Theatre -- is back to singing again 
on four of the album's 11 songs -- his first vocal recordings in 8 years. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast with the original, idiosyncratic style and exceptional rhythmic 
drive he has brought to his best guitar recordings, <PERSON>Kottke</PERSON>'s gruff-voiced 
singing has always sounded a little creaky. But the new album's vocal numbers 
are all first rate. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, <PERSON>Kottke</PERSON> said in a recent phone interview, using lyrics and vocals 
enabled him to put into music philosophical notions that had been circling 
around in his head for a long time. 
</P>
<P>
It all comes out in "Jack Gets Up," an offbeat song that starts as a litany of 
complaints about the boredom of daily living but winds up an oddly moving 
anthem to the meaningfulness of everyday things. 
</P>
<P>
"It touches me," <PERSON>Kottke</PERSON> said of the song. "It just came out of a mood I've 
sustained the last few years. If I even attempt to describe it, it would be 
nothing but maudlin. What I like about the song is that I managed to convey the 
sense of it without being maudlin. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole album has a lot of this feeling for me that I've kind of missed for 
the last few records. It didn't concentrate on the production or the chops, but 
the feelings involved." 
</P>
<P>
On "<PERSON>Jack</PERSON> Gets Up," rather than make high-blown pronouncements about his 
feelings, <PERSON>Kottke</PERSON> simply introduces us to a fellow who gets out of bed in a 
bearish mood and strings jumbled thoughts together in a grumbling 
stream-of-consciousness as he prepares to face another day. The ordinary 
details embedded in this crotchety anthem make it an affirmation of life in all 
its irksome, roll-out-of-bed-too-early dailiness. 
</P>
<P>
"I think (being) down to earth is finally how you put up with the shock of 
seeing the curve, the big view" of life, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Now 43, <PERSON>Kottke</PERSON> said his thinking has begun running toward the big view in the 
last few years: "You see the value of the immediate -- things like lint (which 
<PERSON>Jack</PERSON> finds in his pockets) or how your kid's face looks" (according to the 
song, "like a walnut from the ice cream," a description that <PERSON>Kottke</PERSON> said 
reflects how his son, <PERSON>Joe</PERSON>, now 18, appeared to him as a small boy). 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Kottke</PERSON> said he tried to address the ideas that come out in "<PERSON>Jack</PERSON> Gets Up" in a 
<DATE>1986</DATE> instrumental piece, "Ice Fields" but found that singing made it more 
complete. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it has as much to do with just hearing a human voice as the actual 
words that make it work," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Even when he was devoting his albums exclusively to instrumental music, <PERSON>Kottke</PERSON> 
always sang a few tunes in concert. 
</P>
<P>
"If I'm in my register, I'm real happy about my voice," the <LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION> resident 
said in a deep, grainy speaking voice. "It took me a while to realize who I was 
vocally. I can't just open my mouth and holler. 
</P>
<P>
"Once I figured that out, I began to find a place for myself. I'm confident 
with it, but I'm not sure I have the kind of individuality when I sing that I 
have when I play the guitar. I'm really drawn to the guitar. The guitar is 
something I can't imagine being without. Music is secondary." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Kottke</PERSON> said he is struck by something that a friend who had studied in <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> 
told him: In Spanish classical guitar circles, there are separate words for a 
guitarist devoted strictly to a love affair with the instrument (a guitarrero), 
and one who brings more perspective to the matter, seeing the guitar as a tool 
to make music, rather than as an end in itself (a guitarrista). 
</P>
<P>
While the Spanish classicists save their esteem for the guitarristas, <PERSON>Kottke</PERSON> 
confessed to being a confirmed guitarrero. 
</P>
<P>
In the view of those classicists, <PERSON>Kottke</PERSON> said: "There's something irresponsible 
about pigging out on the guitar, paying attention only to that and not to the 
broader field that it's a part of. They want a complete and sober musician, as 
opposed to this addict." 
</P>
<P>
Addict or not, <PERSON>Kottke</PERSON>'s concerts are not one-dimensional showcases that would 
appeal only to guitar lovers. Besides nimble hands and a serviceable voice, he 
brings to bear a dry, offbeat sense of humor. 
</P>
<P>
"It started one night when I was playing in <LOCATION>Minneapolis</LOCATION> in about <DATE>1967</DATE>," <PERSON>Kottke</PERSON> 
said, recalling how he learned the value of a joke. "I had been playing for a 
number of years and not saying one word. I couldn't look up. But I found myself 
struggling with a gooseneck on the microphone stand, and it reminded me of the 
time I tried to kill a chicken and failed. I couldn't bring myself to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Kottke started talking about that childhood experience with the chicken, and 
his audience began to laugh. "I realized how much I enjoyed it, and I couldn't 
help but notice how much the audience enjoyed it." 
</P>
<P>
He has pursued a humorist's approach to performing ever since. "On the other 
hand," he said, "a waitress in <LOCATION>Santa Cruz</LOCATION> the other night told me I talked too 
much." 
</P>
<P>
Kottke is winding up a 3-month tour with <PERSON>Lovett</PERSON>, one of the hottest and most 
critically heralded performers in country music. The two became friends and 
mutual admirers several years ago after they shared a bill in <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>. Now they 
share the same management company and booking agency, which <PERSON>Kottke</PERSON> said made a 
joint tour "almost inevitable." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Kottke</PERSON> said it has been interesting to watch the buzz build around <PERSON>Lovett</PERSON>. As 
for himself, while he said the wry vocal numbers on "My Father's Face" have a 
chance to win him his first substantial radio airplay in quite some time, he is 
content to keep his career on an even keel as a solo performer. 
</P>
<P>
(Among the album's assets are detailed but unobtrusive production by T-Bone 
<PERSON>Burnett</PERSON> and a star supporting band that includes <PERSON>David Hidalgo</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Los Lobos</LOCATION> on 
accordion and second guitar.) 
</P>
<P>
"I've had more than I can handle of mobs and notoriety," <PERSON>Kottke</PERSON> said. "I had a 
riot in <LOCATION>Milan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>. It was about <DATE>1978</DATE>, when there was a real wave of interest 
in the acoustic guitar throughout <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"I took great advantage of that. In <LOCATION>Milan</LOCATION>, there were 4,000 people in the 
theater, and another 2,000 who couldn't get in and decided they would get in 
anyhow. There were four doors caved in, traffic was stopped, people got into 
fights and there were broken windows down the street. I was hiding in a trailer 
behind the theater. It was very flattering. 
</P>
<P>
"I still play <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>, but I don't have riots anymore."

<LEADPARA>  THE Abandoned Luncheonette is reopen for business.;    The acoustic-backed,
soulful vocals of Daryl Hall and John Oates -- using a sound they had before
they became the most successful duo in the history of pop charts -- are
returning in a string of intimate and acoustic concert dates harking back to
the days when songs like "She's Gone" and "Sara Smile" were favorites of rock
stations.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "It's part of our tradition," says <PERSON>Oates</PERSON>. "It's as valid a part of musical
tradition as anything we've done. We just haven't done it in a while. People
don't look at the overview. They only want to know what was your last hit.";  
 Quiet again;    It is easy to recall the string of hits that made <PERSON>Hall</PERSON> and
<PERSON>Oates</PERSON> more successful than the <ORGANIZATION>Righteous Brothers</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Simon</PERSON> and <PERSON>Garfunkel</PERSON> as
pop's biggest duo -- "Kiss on My List,' "You Make My Dreams," "I Can't Go for
That," "Did It in a Minute," "Maneater," "One on One" and "Adult Education"
among them.;    But the latest incarnation of the duo, which surfaced on the
recent, quieter "Change of Season" album, has them closer to things on their
folky first album, "Whole Oates.";    "That's how John and I started," <PERSON>Hall</PERSON>
says. "When we first got together, <PERSON>John</PERSON> was playing acoustic guitar, and I was
playing mandolin, the electric keyboard and a little guitar. And we used to
play small clubs and things like that.";    They played as a duo for a year
before they added a band, he says. "Then we had a similar situation where we
added a drum and a guy playing bass who also played upright bass and bowed
bass, so we had that drony string sound, which we're doing on this tour. We
have a violinist and a cellist with us in addition to the regular band, which
gives it a real R&amp;B feel.";    A guitarist, drummer, saxophone player and a
couple of grand pianos join them on the current tour. "It's as acoustic as you
can make it in <DATE>1991</DATE> and still play to a lot of people," <PERSON>Oates</PERSON> says.;   
Although none of the guitars will be electric, he adds, "The one concession we
have is that we've decided to use our <PERSON>Hammond</PERSON> B-3 organ. Only because it's
old, and it's made out of wood. We figured that somehow that qualified it.";  
 Besides some songs on the new album that work well in spare arrangement, they
perform old chestnuts -- "songs we haven't played in years, some of which
we've never played live," <PERSON>Oates</PERSON> says. "Going back to the 'Abandoned
Luncheonette.' ";    There is no saying <PERSON>Hall</PERSON> and <PERSON>Oates</PERSON> won't go back to the
big, dance-oriented sound they helped make popular on the Top 40 airwaves,
<PERSON>Hall</PERSON> says. "But it felt like some of the heart left music in the late '80s,
and I wanted to rediscover it in ourselves as well as put it out.;    "I'm a
little tired of hearing the same drum machine program being played all the
time," he says. "Also, I liked the idea of having musicians playing together
-- the real interaction you get only if people are playing real instruments.";
   "We wanted to play on our strengths -- songwriting and our singing," <PERSON>Oates</PERSON>
says. A more spare album helped show that off. "When you stripped it down --
and the production isn't the star of the show, the meat and potatoes show
through, and that's the songs and the singing.";    Record-company resistance;
   Was there resistance to this quiet approach from a record company that
expected more hits?;    "In a word," says <PERSON>Oates</PERSON>, "yes.;    "In pop music,
everyone likes you to be the same. They want that package of cereal. They
recognize the Wheaties box, and it's easier to grab it off the shelf without
looking at it than it is to actually think about it. There's a lot of safety
in that. There's a lot of security in it. But it's the first step in creating
a rut for yourself that you can't get out of.";    "<ORGANIZATION>Arista</ORGANIZATION> is a very
urban-oriented, very singles-oriented company," <PERSON>Hall</PERSON> says. "They went, 'I
don't know. This sounds great, but it's not "The Hitmakers of the '80s Sound."
' I said, 'That's right.' ";    Part of their return to roots has to do with
their escape from the city. Hall lives near <LOCATION>Pawling</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>, where the album was
recorded; <PERSON>Oates</PERSON> has become a <LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION> resident, living in Redding.;   
Changing some of their hits to an acoustic arrangement for the current tour
wasn't as hard as they thought it would be, <PERSON>Oates</PERSON> says. "Even a song like 'No
Can Do.' We thought, now here's a song we'll never be able to pull off. It's
got a drum machine, a real strong electric guitar sound, that kind of thing.
But it sounds great. It sounds different, but it sounds great."  </TEXT>

<LP>
   New York -- Sinead O'Connor is something else. With her
shorn skull and immense eyes, the young Irish singer who's
been topping the album and singles charts has a
tough-but-tender look unique in pop. Her voice is very
different too, an emotional seismograph capable of shifting
instantly from whisper to scream. And so, it seems, are
O'Connor's notions of performance, as she is demonstrating on
her current U.S. tour.
   From the start, this Dublin native has stood out from the
pack. Her arresting debut album "The Lion and the Cobra"
(Chrysalis), released three years ago when she was 20, had an
elemental intensity. The songs, most of which O'Connor wrote
and produced, burned with all the anger, pain and yearning of
her Dickensian-sounding adolescence.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   O'Connor's vocal fireworks were matched by her musical
daring. She boldly mixed styles ranging from Celtic folk to
symphonic to hip hop -- sometimes within a single composition
-- for a sound as stirring and unpredictable as the passions,
obsessions and betrayals of which she sang. Occasionally the
results were excessive, but never boring.
   Her new album, "I Do Not Want What I Haven't Got"
(<ORGANIZATION>Chrysalis</ORGANIZATION>), is another story. As the title suggests, this is
a more sober document, the statement of an artist who says
she's found serenity (in interviews she credits domestic
bliss, particularly her recent marriage to the father of her
toddler son). O'Connor's themes have stayed pretty much the
same, if expressed in more confessional terms, but her music
has contracted, muted.
   Except for the odd three-chord rocker, "I Do Not Want"
tends toward folkish hum-and-strum numbers that run no risk
of waking the baby. Or startling the listener. Lyrically
<PERSON>O'Connor</PERSON> cuts to the quick. But musically not much happens
and, at a lengthy five minutes per track, it sounds like even
less.
   It definitely doesn't sound like blockbuster stuff. But
there's a wild card here -- the one song <PERSON>O'Connor</PERSON> didn't
write (Prince did). Called "Nothing Compares 2 U," it's a
torchy lament of lost love. The only thing more wrenching
than the ache with which <PERSON>O'Connor</PERSON> sings the ballad is the way
she looks in the accompanying video. All eyes, she's caught
in tight close-up like a deer frozen by headlights. To resist
her appeal would be like killing Bambi.
   And so it was that <PERSON>O'Connor</PERSON> arrived here last week for two
sold-out shows with the No. 1 album and single in the
country, the hot ticket. Scalpers trolled the blocks around
the Beacon Theatre. Inside the standing-room-only crowd
buzzed expectantly. When the curtain finally rose, revealing
a solitary figure in a cross of light, the audience exploded.
   With her broad-shouldered biker jacket and tight pants,
<PERSON>O'Connor</PERSON> looked like an Oscar statuette. She stood as still
as one while the whoops and shrieks continued, drowning out
what she was singing. Eventually you could make out the words
to the new album's keynote song, "Feel So Different,"
<PERSON>O'Connor</PERSON>'s declaration of maturity, and the string sounds
swelling from an unseen synthesizer. But all it took was the
tiniest flutter of her hands -- or voice -- for the crowd to
erupt again.
   They roared at the end of the song when <PERSON>O'Connor</PERSON> doffed
the black snood she'd been wearing, exposing her shaved pate.
She said something indistinguishable. Then she and the
now-visible five-piece band kicked into the chugging riffs of
"The Emperor's New Clothes." The group seemed to energize if
not animate her. Though <PERSON>O'Connor</PERSON> remained as poker-faced as
during the opening number, while the song crested she hopped
like a sparrow -- to the audience's delight.
   Then a percussion rat-a-tat signaled the start of "I Want
Your (Hands on Me)," the first album's dance club hit,
bringing the crowd to its feet. In the eerie purple and green
lighting, <PERSON>O'Connor</PERSON> stripped down to a black bustier. The band
pumped. She sang strongly, giving an edge of menace to her
invitation, but she moved as if in a trance. Footlights threw
her looming shadow against the back of the stage. When she
ran her hands over her thin frame, dipping down to her
crotch, the effect was less erotic than macabre.
   Next it was back to the new album for "You Cause as Much
Sorrow." As the band played the piano-embellished folk tune,
<PERSON>O'Connor</PERSON> accompanied herself with the by-now familiar hand
flutters and arm flaps. Unusual in their own right -- a
spastic hula came to mind -- <PERSON>O'Connor</PERSON>'s otherwise zombielike
demeanor made them seem truly bizarre. It was as if the
intensity of <PERSON>O'Connor</PERSON>'s singing had drained the life from her
body, leaving only a spasmodically jerking shell.
   Before the end of the song O'Connor walked offstage. She
returned with an acoustic guitar and began to strum "Three
Babies." As a guitar player she proved a good singer, but at
least the instrument gave her someplace to put her hands.
   Alone except for a backup guitarist, <PERSON>O'Connor</PERSON> continued
with more of the new album's chamber music. The fans, though,
seemed on a different frequency. They cheered and whooped
intermittently for no apparent reason, in the vocal
equivalent of a wave. Their high spirits were particularly
ill-timed; the tune was <PERSON>O'Connor</PERSON>'s indictment of racism in
<LOCATION>England</LOCATION>, "Black Boys on Mopeds." But maybe they couldn't
tell. In the barebones folkie arrangement, it didn't sound
all that different from the preceding song -- or from other
new numbers.
   Fortunately the pace picked up with "<PERSON>Jackie</PERSON>," a keening
lament from the first album, and "I Am Stretched on Your
Grave," a newer lament that <PERSON>O'Connor</PERSON> ended by executing a
brisk jig. The return of the excellent but underutilized band
turned up the intensity another notch for the Big Hit, which
<PERSON>O'Connor</PERSON> gave a suitably big-voiced rendition.
   To forestall any letdown, she followed "Nothing Compares"
with a triple play of spirited material. First came the rocky
"Jump in the River," then the ominous "Jerusalem" and finally
the guitar-powered "Mandinka," as close to a traditional pop
song as she has written.
   With a "Thank you very much, good night," <PERSON>O'Connor</PERSON> and the
band were off the stage. But the fans weren't buying it. They
bellowed loudly, held aloft lit matches and didn't budge.
   In a few minutes blue lights washed over the stage and
<PERSON>O'Connor</PERSON> was back, accompanied only by her guitar. Cheers
greeted the opening of "Troy." Even without the roiling
symphonic accompaniment she gave it on the first album, this
invective against a faithless lover is one of <PERSON>O'Connor</PERSON>'s
angriest songs, almost thrilling in its vehemence. As she
stormed through it, her growls and howls were matched by the
crowd. The tension built, and built some more. Finally,
bansheelike, she screeched, "You're still a liar]"
   And then she was gone.

SHOCKED DOESN'T RETREAT; SHE STILL SUPPLIES HIGH VOLTAGE

<TEXT>
<P>
In switching from her folk-based songs to the seemingly less-confrontational 
jump-blues pleasures of her current horn-driven "Captain Swing" album, <PERSON>Michelle 
Shocked</PERSON> has some fans and critics thinking she's abandoned her radical 
barricades. 
</P>
<P>
At the <ORGANIZATION>Coach House</ORGANIZATION> <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>, Shocked's overwhelming, life-charged 21-song 
performance made it clear she's not retreating, just exploring other avenues of 
liberation. Specifically, her performance asserted, there's no point in manning 
the front lines unless you've also got your backfield in motion. 
</P>
<P>
Before getting far into her set, the slight, impish singer felt it necessary to 
justify her recent changes to the audience. She wryly maintained, "It's no 
secret that political correctness has been a serious social disease for the 
last several years. . . . Don't make the mistakes I did." In prescribing 
shaking some booty to Professor Longhair tapes as a cure, she went on to quote 
radical forbear <PERSON>Emma Goldman</PERSON>: "What good's a revolution if I can't dance?" 
</P>
<P>
Shocked's flat-out-wonderful, dance-happy music needed no justifying manifesto. 
Like the glory days of ululant "wop mop a lu mop" rock, the wild, unfettered 
spirit of the singer and her six-piece Captain Swing Revue conveyed all the 
liberation one could ask for. 
</P>
<P>
With some input from her producer, <PERSON>Pete Anderson</PERSON> (who also helms <PERSON>Dwight 
Yoakam</PERSON>'s recordings and is a master guitarist in his own right), Shocked has 
assembled a monstrously good band, with a stylistic purview ranging from 
swinging Louis Jordan-influenced jump arrangements to free jazz to rampant 
rockabilly. 
</P>
<P>
Though Shocked's voice is far from naturally suited to the rigors of a 
horn-blaring outfit, she pushed her limitations and communicated the crucial 
life and emotion often missed by more skilled singers. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes awash in the band's anarchic-but-tight musical melee, her lyrics 
remained politically incisive -- as with the current album's "homeless trilogy" 
of "God Is a Real Estate Developer," "The Cement Lament" and "Streetcorner 
Ambassador" -- and evocative of the byways of American life. With a rare eye 
for detail, "(Making the Run to) <LOCATION>Gladewater</LOCATION>" beautifully delineated adolescent 
life in a small <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> town. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout that song and others, the band members provided a constant foil for 
Shocked. In place of the refined fire of <ORGANIZATION>Anderson</ORGANIZATION>'s playing on the albums, band 
guitarist <PERSON>Jon Dee Graham</PERSON> delivered wrenching, emotional guitar lines. 
Keyboardist Skip <PERSON>Edwards</PERSON> ranged from gospel organ hues to Longhair-ed romps on 
his instrument, while horn players <PERSON>Jim Pollock</PERSON> and <PERSON>Darrell Leonard</PERSON> touched on 
everything from <PERSON>Sidney Bechet</PERSON> to <LOCATION>Don Cherry</LOCATION> in their spirited playing. 
</P>
<P>
In expanding her musical scope, Shocked has by no means lost touch with her 
folk finesse. She did a mid-show solo acoustic turn, playing the haunting, 
fragile reminiscence "Memories of <LOCATION>East Texas</LOCATION>," "5 a.m. in <LOCATION>Amsterdam</LOCATION>," an a 
cappella <PERSON>Steve Goodman</PERSON> anti-war ode, and a mandolin and fiddle instrumental 
tune, "<PERSON>Jeff Davis</PERSON>," on which she was joined by her father and brother. 
</P>
<P>
Her closing encore song, the unreleased "<PERSON>Makin</PERSON>' Jam," recommended eschewing the 
"corporate jam factories" because "If you want the best, you've got to make 
your own." 
</P>
<P>
As the band percolated under her voice, Shocked made her point more explicit: 
"If there's one thing that I want you to know, it's that if I can do this, you 
can do it too. . . . When it comes down to it, there's a thing true about music 
and politics: They're both too important to be left to professionals like us." 
</P>
<P>
If that isn't the basic -- though all but subverted lately -- message of rock 
and roll, what is? 
</P>
<P>
Opener <PERSON>John Wesley Harding</PERSON> fared better with the audience than when he first 
appeared at the <ORGANIZATION>Coach House</ORGANIZATION> a few months back. He earned an encore call this 
time, but his performance remained more clever than compelling. One could do 
worse than to draw on <PERSON>Elvis Costello</PERSON> as a signal influence -- along with 
<PERSON>Harding</PERSON>'s comparatively tortured wordplay, he's got the <ORGANIZATION>Big E</ORGANIZATION>'s vocal 
inflections down to a T -- but <PERSON>Harding</PERSON>'s own limited talents couldn't help 
looking that much thinner when he so often borrowed <PERSON>Costello</PERSON>'s big suit.

RELEASE BY SINGER/SONGWRITER DAVID BAERWALD, NOW GOING IT ALONE, IS GARNERING 
ACCLAIM.

<P>
Most critics agreed that <PERSON>David + David</PERSON>'s <DATE>1986</DATE> album, "Boomtown," was one of the 
coolest releases of the decade. But now it's the '90s and <PERSON>David + David</PERSON> became 
<PERSON>David</PERSON>. David as in <LOCATION>Ricketts</LOCATION> is gone and <PERSON>Baerwald</PERSON> remains, and his current 
release, "Bedtime Stories," is garnering similar acclaim. The L.A.-based 
singer/songwriter will be at <ORGANIZATION>The Carnaval Club</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Santa Barbara</LOCATION> <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>, 
sort of a musical alternative to the <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION>. Baerwald's lyrics are equally 
hard-hitting -- there's just less blood. 
</P>
<P>
A wry writer with a cynic's wit, <PERSON>Baerwald</PERSON> describes losers losing, winners 
losing, whiners whining, winners whining, lovers leaving, losers loving and 
everyone pretty much confused and overwhelmed by it all. Baerwald's not exactly 
a barrel of laughs. He could have written great film noir mysteries in the 
<DATE>'40s</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
David + <PERSON>David</PERSON> originally planned a follow-up to their <DATE>1986</DATE> debut, but <PERSON>Ricketts</PERSON> 
got sidetracked producing an album for folk singer <PERSON>Toni Childs</PERSON>, and the project 
was forever sidetracked. On the new one, <PERSON>Baerwald</PERSON> collaborated with <PERSON>Larry 
Klein</PERSON>, who co-wrote many of the tracks. David + Larry? However you add it up, 
the new one, produced by <LOCATION>Los Lobos</LOCATION> sax man <PERSON>Steve Berlin</PERSON>, is more Angst with a 
beat. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent telephone interview, <PERSON>Baerwald</PERSON> had this to say: 
</P>
<P>
What about the tour and the new record? 
</P>
<P>
The <LOCATION>Santa Barbara</LOCATION> show will be the first show on the tour although we did play 
The Roxy a week or so ago. It was a breeze. The album is doing about like the 
last one. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>David + David</PERSON> was a hit. Now it's <PERSON>David</PERSON>. What happened? 
</P>
<P>
Well, you can only have a big brother for so long before you want to kill him. 
</P>
<P>
Like <PERSON>Wally</PERSON> and The Beaver? 
</P>
<P>
Exactly. 
</P>
<P>
How is this album different from the last, or is it different? Is it true that 
<PERSON>Ricketts</PERSON> basically did the music and you wrote the lyrics? 
</P>
<P>
Not really. Both <PERSON>Ricketts</PERSON> and I play guitar, bass and keyboards. The new one is 
very similar to the old one, except on this one <PERSON>Larry Klein</PERSON> did most of the 
music. We had people come in for the stuff we couldn't do or didn't want to do. 
We'll have a six-piece band on our tour. 
</P>
<P>
Describe <PERSON>David Baerwald</PERSON> music. 
</P>
<P>
Genius. 
</P>
<P>
On the album cover, you're holding your head in your hands as if you're in 
pain, in deep thought or looking in the mirror at <PERSON>Peter Murphy</PERSON>, what's wrong? 
</P>
<P>
Actually, I'm embarrassed. 
</P>
<P>
In a Rolling Stone interview you say that " ... it's easier to survive if 
you're a killer -- especially if what you killed is something inside yourself 
... " Explain. 
</P>
<P>
I think I was talking about a song called "Stranger," and how things can happen 
to a person that just makes you want to sit down and quit being open with 
people. It's too early in the <TIME>morning</TIME> for this stuff. 
</P>
<P>
What happened to <PERSON>Ricketts</PERSON>? 
</P>
<P>
He's still around -- he's on his way over right now. We're still friends. 
</P>
<P>
Was <PERSON>J. Geils</PERSON> right, does love stink? 
</P>
<P>
No, love is what makes the world go 'round. 
</P>
<P>
Does bad love make for good songs? 
</P>
<P>
It can go both ways. 
</P>
<P>
How did you get started in music? 
</P>
<P>
I'm from <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> originally, but my family moved to <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> when I was a kid -- my 
Dad is a teacher. I learned to play guitar in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>. Then we moved to <LOCATION>Los 
Angeles</LOCATION>, and I didn't know anybody in school until I met this other kid who 
also played guitar. So we started a band when I was about 12 or 13. We played 
parties and stuff and then the punk thing happened and sort of sucked us up. I 
used to be a roadie for The Weirdos. I used to play in bars when I was 15 -- I 
grew up in nightclubs. Anyway, since I was underage, they'd make me wait 
outside in the parking lot until it was time to play. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Randy Newman</PERSON> loves <LOCATION>L.A.</LOCATION> Is he right? 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>L.A.</LOCATION> is paradise. 
</P>
<P>
There's a pretty intense song on the new one called "Dance." Does everyone, 
even the wall flowers, dance? 
</P>
<P>
Everybody's got to dance sometime. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
* WHERE AND WHEN: <PERSON>David Baerwald</PERSON> will perform <DATE>Monday</DATE> at <TIME>9 p.m.</TIME> at the <ORGANIZATION>Carnaval 
Club</ORGANIZATION>, 634 <ORGANIZATION>State St.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Santa Barbara</LOCATION>. For information, call, 963-9991. Tickets 
are <MONEY>$5</MONEY>.

JIM MURRAY: VACATIONS DO HAVE THEIR TRAPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jim Murray 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Every vacation you go on, you hope for three things: 
</P>
<P>
 -- To take 10 strokes off your handicap. 
</P>
<P>
 -- To get a tan. 
</P>
<P>
 -- To get a rest. 
</P>
<P>
Well, one out of three ain't bad. The tan, I got. 
</P>
<P>
My golf game which you have to know, if it were human, belongs in an iron lung, 
I gave no break at all to. I went to <PERSON>Jack Nicklaus</PERSON> and told him I opted to play 
his new course on the island of <LOCATION>Kauai</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>Kiele</LOCATION> on <LOCATION>Kalapaki Beach</LOCATION> at the 
<LOCATION>Westin Kauai</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"It'll add 10 strokes to your handicap," frowned <PERSON>Jack</PERSON>. "It's for guys who can 
play a little." 
</P>
<P>
"Ten shots in my handicap is like a pitcher of water in the ocean," I told him. 
"Where's the first tee?" 
</P>
<P>
Now, I don't know what Kiele stands for in English but, by the fourth hole, the 
best guess in the foursome was that it was Hawaiian for gas chamber. 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION> is a funny place. They put umbrellas in the drinks and orchids in the 
eggs. They take the prettiest island landscape in all the world -- and make a 
leper colony out of it. Now, the last thing a poor leper needs is a view. Or a 
drink with an umbrella in it. But <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>'s a place where they take some of the 
most breathtaking scenery in all the world -- and put a hotel on it. 
</P>
<P>
But nowhere is there a more diabolical use of real estate than to take the 
<LOCATION>Pacific Ocean</LOCATION> and make a par-5 out of it with no place to lay up. It is widely 
reported that only five people have ever made the back nine at <ORGANIZATION>Kiele</ORGANIZATION>. More 
people have been to the <LOCATION>North Pole</LOCATION> than the 18th hole. 
</P>
<P>
As if it's not tough enough, every time you get a good lie, it starts to rain. 
The drinks aren't the only things that need umbrellas. But the natives assure 
you these are just showers. They seldom last more than two days. One old-timer 
told me they got a place there where it rains more than it does anywhere else 
in the world. 
</P>
<P>
"I know," I told him. "And they stuck a pin in it and called it 18. It's the 
only hole in the world where you need a driver, a seven-iron, two wedges and a 
canoe." 
</P>
<P>
They named one hole -- a 459-yard par-4 into the wind -- the Rabbit. So, you 
can imagine what the hole called the Gorilla is like. Something they pulled off 
the <ORGANIZATION>Empire State Building</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
I played with <PERSON>Sammy White</PERSON>, the old <ORGANIZATION>Red Sox</ORGANIZATION> catcher, up in <LOCATION>Princeville</LOCATION>, and 
<PERSON>Sammy</PERSON> calls me <ORGANIZATION>Shakespeare</ORGANIZATION>, in honor of my calling, as in: "Well, <ORGANIZATION>Shakespeare</ORGANIZATION>, 
you better tee up another one, as that one's just passed the <LOCATION>Lahaina Roads</LOCATION>. Use 
an old ball if you've got one." 
</P>
<P>
Sammy plays golf with a pith helmet, a big cigar and a smother hook. Sammy once 
hit a grand slam bottom-of-the-10th home run off <PERSON>Satchel Paige</PERSON>, so it is not 
too surprising to find him out here, beachcombing out of the company of 
civilized men. A man who would do that would throw a brick through a Rembrandt. 
It is reliably reported to be the last ball <PERSON>Sammy</PERSON> hit in fair territory 
anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
At <ORGANIZATION>Kiele</ORGANIZATION>, I played with <PERSON>Frank Sullivan</PERSON>, the old <ORGANIZATION>Red Sox</ORGANIZATION> pitcher and <ORGANIZATION>Sammy 
White</ORGANIZATION>'s battery mate. Frank won 18 games one year and might have been a Cy 
Young candidate if he could ever have gotten <PERSON>Vic Wertz</PERSON> out. As one-time <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> 
sportswriter <PERSON>Clif Keane</PERSON> used to say, "Even if <PERSON>Frank</PERSON> didn't let go of the ball, 
<PERSON>Wertz</PERSON> would have doubled off him." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> was a control pitcher on the mound, but he's lost the strike zone over 
the years. He hits sliders off the tee now that not even <PERSON>Wertz</PERSON> could get a bat 
on. 
</P>
<P>
While you're on vacation, out of touch with the commercial realities, you hope 
the world will change -- for the better. You hope people will stop killing each 
other, politicians will stop lying, colleges will stop cheating, <PERSON>Mike Tyson</PERSON> 
will lose a round, and the Cubs will stay up there. You get to be a kind of 
<LOCATION>Pollyanna</LOCATION>, listening to all those trade winds and ukulele strings. 
</P>
<P>
I had hoped to come home to find the Clippers had signed <PERSON>Danny Ferry</PERSON> or traded 
him for an all-world guard, hoped that the Dodgers were in first, the Angels 
pulling away, that maybe the Raiders got a quarterback, a golf tournament was 
won by somebody you heard of, that they found that <PERSON>Pete Rose</PERSON> only bet on dog 
races, maybe we won a <ORGANIZATION>Davis Cup</ORGANIZATION> or <PERSON>John McEnroe</PERSON> had apologized to the world and 
<PERSON>Don King</PERSON> got a haircut. 
</P>
<P>
Alas! The world is still a testy par-5 over water with poison ivy in the rough, 
an alligator in the sand trap and the pin cut over a cliff with the ocean at 
the bottom. The world is an unplayable lie. 
</P>
<P>
Ferry is not going to play for the <ORGANIZATION>Clippers</ORGANIZATION>, although I do think he 
overreacted, signing with Messaggero to play in <LOCATION>Rome</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>. <LOCATION>Kansas City</LOCATION> 
probably would have been far enough. But <PERSON>Danny</PERSON> is taking no chances. 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers thought they had won <ORGANIZATION>Danny Ferry</ORGANIZATION> in the lottery, but you know how 
those mail lotteries are. Probably had <PERSON>Ed McMahon</PERSON>'s picture on it. That's all 
the Clippers do win -- lotteries. Games, they haven't got the hang of. 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>Dodgers</ORGANIZATION> are trying to win the pennant with a whole bunch of left fielders 
and not much else. One of our guys finally won a British Open, our first in 
seven years, but a Brazilian won Indy, so that's a push. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe I should go back on vacation, give the world another two weeks to shape 
up. All things considered, I'd rather be back on <ORGANIZATION>Kiele</ORGANIZATION>, lying six on a par-5 
hole and not yet to the dogleg, and <ORGANIZATION>Sammy White</ORGANIZATION> talking on my backswing, 
telling me what kind of a pitch he hit off <PERSON>Satchel</PERSON>, which is like <PERSON>Marciano</PERSON> 
telling you what kind of a punch knocked out <PERSON>Joe Louis</PERSON> or the captain of the 
Titanic telling you what course hit the iceberg. 
</P>
<P>
Back here in the real world, all kinds of terrible things keep being possible. 
<LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> might get in the World Series, for instance. If so, the guy I saw in 
the airport at <LOCATION>Lihue</LOCATION> is ready. He had a T-shirt that read: "<LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>, 
Attitude Capital of the World." 
</P>
<P>
He didn't want to go home, either.

<TEXT>
   As the bassist and songwriting partner of <PERSON>George
Michael</PERSON>, <PERSON>Deon Estus</PERSON> is used to playing to capacity crowds. But the
<LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION> native has also learned to appreciate an empty arena.
   <PERSON>Estus</PERSON>, who now has a hit single of his own with ``Heaven Help
Me,'' likes to arrive early for the evening's concert so he can
pursue his favorite hobby: Frisbee.
   ``On the road I carry about 40 Frisbees with kneepads and
gloves,'' he said. ``As they set up the equipment before the show,
either in the stadium or outside the arena, there are no people
around. When we played the <ORGANIZATION>Orange Bowl</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, we had a ball.
Everybody joined in.''
   Between playing for one of the world's most successful recording
artists and making his debut solo album, ``Spell,'' <PERSON>Estus</PERSON> has
needed to stay in shape. He is already at work on another record
and will collaborate with <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> on the singer's next project, a
double LP.
   ``We understand each other,'' said <PERSON>Estus</PERSON>, who referred to the
singer as his best friend. ``We get along, we go out and have
dinner. It's very easy to sit down and come up with a song. We just
sit down and write good music. He's very professional and so am I.
He's not in competition with me.''
   Estus, whose parents both hold graduate degrees in music, had
any number of instruments to chose from as a child, remembering the
drums, bass, guitars and piano his father brought home. He quickly
mastered them all but admitted to having no such luck playing the
saxophone.
   ``I got rid of it, eventually,'' <PERSON>Estus</PERSON> said. ``It just used to
kill me. It just wasn't for me. It sounded like people when they
screech chalk on the blackboard.''
   Estus settled on the bass and was playing professionally by age
12.
   ``I used to play house parties in the <DATE>summer</DATE> and got 20 bucks
each time. That was a lot of dough.''
   Detroit in the <DATE>1960s</DATE> was home to the Motown record label and
<PERSON>Estus</PERSON> took full advantage of the local talent. He became friends
with <PERSON>Marvin Gaye</PERSON> but turned down the opportunity to play on the
late singer's last album, ``Midnight Love,'' released in <DATE>1982</DATE>.
   ``That was a time when I was busy recording. I didn't have any
idea he'd be leaving us so fast,'' said <PERSON>Estus</PERSON>, referring to <PERSON>Gaye</PERSON>'s
murder in <DATE>1984</DATE>. ``I thought I'd see him again. Everybody had
troubles but I didn't sense that anything like that would happen.''
   Estus referred to <ORGANIZATION>Motown</ORGANIZATION> bassist <PERSON>James Jamerson</PERSON> as ``my
teacher.'' <PERSON>Jamerson</PERSON>, who died in <DATE>1983</DATE>, was instrumental to the
Motown sound, creating memorable bass lines on such hits as ``Reach
Out I'll Be There'' and ``Ain't No Mountain High Enough.''
   ``He's the man who brought syncopation to the bass,'' <PERSON>Estus</PERSON>
said. ```My <PERSON>Cherie Amour</PERSON>.' Listen to the bass parts on that. He was
a mindblower. I just never heard bass put like that _ the
expression. When you listen to records today you hear his
influence.''
   <PERSON>Estus</PERSON>' first band was ``Brainstorm,'' which toured in support of
the Whispers and the <ORGANIZATION>Brothers Johnson</ORGANIZATION> among other groups. He moved
to <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> in the early '80s, and lived in <LOCATION>Belgium</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Ireland</LOCATION>
before eventually settling in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, his current home.
   ``I think I've been influenced by everywhere I've been,'' <PERSON>Estus</PERSON>
said.
   ``<LOCATION>Dublin</LOCATION>, for instance. When I first worked there I'd listen to
these local bands. The harmonies were really tricky. I was
listening to this rhythm and thought this was the thing closest to
black music I'd heard. I learned a great deal from it.''
   <PERSON>Estus</PERSON> was the silent partner of ``Wham!,'' the British band that
featured <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> and <PERSON>Andrew Ridgeley</PERSON> and had hits in the mid-<DATE>'80s</DATE>
with ``Careless Whisper'' and ``I'm Your Man.''
   After Wham! broke up, <PERSON>Estus</PERSON> stayed with <PERSON>Michael</PERSON>, working on the
singer's best-selling ``Faith'' <ORGANIZATION>LP</ORGANIZATION>. He found time, however, to
record ``Spell'' and served as <PERSON>Michael</PERSON>'s opening act on the world
tour.
   ``Heaven Help Me,'' which features <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> on backing vocals, is
a catchy mid-tempo ballad, but <PERSON>Estus</PERSON> rated the title song of
``Spell'' as his favorite.
   ``I got a chance to produce it and I like the orchestration.
It's a fun song, a strong song. Some songs on `Spell' are more
danceable than others, some are poppy, some are soulful.''
   He appeared unconcerned that having a hit record of his own
could jeopardize the partnership with <PERSON>Michael</PERSON>.
   ``If I had a No. 1 album and he had a No. 3 album and he asked
me to open for him, I would say, `Yes.' If this album sold 2 or <MONEY>3
million</MONEY>, I would still play with him. It's just dealing with egos.''

BLUEGRASS AND WESTERN SWING: TWO BANDS DOING THEIR THING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN

<TEXT>
<P>
Along with the grit that got washed out of country music when it was watered 
down by "crossover appeal" in the '70s, country's longtime emphasis on 
instrumental prowess also seemed to get lost in the flood. Outside of <PERSON>Ricky 
Scaggs</PERSON>, the indomitable <PERSON>Merle Haggard</PERSON> and a handful of others, the notion that 
axes can speak louder than words has largely gone ignored in these past two 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
It figures then that two of the best instrumental acts in country during that 
time, New Grass Revival and Asleep at the Wheel, have existed only at the 
fringes of the country-music community. But, if the two bands' clamorously 
received early show <DATE>Monday</DATE> at the <ORGANIZATION>Crazy Horse Steak House</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Santa Ana</LOCATION> was any 
indication, it's high time they came in from the cold. 
</P>
<P>
Since it was formed by frontman-singer-guitarist <PERSON>Ray Benson</PERSON> in the early '70s, 
Asleep at the Wheel has been rivaled only by <ORGANIZATION>Haggard</ORGANIZATION> in keeping alive the brand 
of music known as Western swing, a hybrid of country and jazz originated by <PERSON>Bob 
Wills</PERSON> and His Texas Playboys in the '30s. It's a music well worth saving, a 
true piece of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>, with both hard times and an expansive view of the future 
shaping its musical moods. And, true to its title, it most certainly swings. 
</P>
<P>
Through the years <PERSON>Benson</PERSON> has gone through well over 60 band mates (an attrition 
due more, perhaps, to the band's 300-days-a-year touring schedule than <PERSON>Benson</PERSON>'s 
reputedly volatile nature). While his present seven-piece lineup didn't burn 
quite as hot as it did in the days when steel guitar monster Lucky Oceans was 
in the band, it was still a remarkably tight outfit. And, on stage, the lanky 
<PERSON>Benson</PERSON> is nothing but pure entertainer, with an engaging-if-limited voice, some 
tremendous chops on the guitar and a flair for showmanship that had him 
juggling potatoes and catching them on his hat brim by show's end. 
</P>
<P>
The material ranged from the rock classics "Route 66" and "Hot Rod Lincoln" to 
<PERSON>Louis Jordan</PERSON>'s R&amp;B novelty "Ain't Nobody Here but Us Chickens" to the 
boogie-woogie "The House of Blue Lights." Throughout, the hot ensemble playing 
and solo flashes recalled Wills' band, which was directly represented by "San 
Antonio Rose," "Roly Poly," and "Take Me Back to <LOCATION>Tulsa</LOCATION>." 
</P>
<P>
While the band has strong soloists on piano, sax and fiddle, the most 
consistently inventive playing came from steel player <PERSON>John Ely</PERSON>, particularly on 
a harmonic-studded solo on "Cotton Patch Rag." Benson's best moment came when 
he strapped on an acoustic guitar for a brief, but remarkably detailed, solo 
version of <PERSON>Robert Wilkins</PERSON>' country blues "Prodigal Son." 
</P>
<P>
Of the two bands, Asleep at the Wheel had the easier row to hoe. While the 
band's set relied almost entirely on Wills' proven style and a songbook of 
standards, <ORGANIZATION>New Grass Revival</ORGANIZATION> applied a challenging and unique reworking of 
bluegrass playing to original material and obscure covers. Even longtime fans 
couldn't count on familiarity, as much of the set came from the forthcoming 
"<DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>Night</TIME> in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>" album. 
</P>
<P>
Quartet members banjoist <PERSON>Bela Fleck</PERSON>, guitarist <PERSON>Pat Flynn</PERSON> and mandolin-fiddle 
player <PERSON>Sam Bush</PERSON> are among the most respected of "musicians' musicians" on their 
respective instruments, while bassist <PERSON>John Cowan</PERSON> brings a strong high-tenor 
voice to their songs. Though their opening spot on the bill required them to 
compress their abilities into a far-too-short eight-song set, even one song 
would have conveyed how special the band is. 
</P>
<P>
Working from a thorough grounding in bluegrass, <PERSON>Fleck</PERSON>, <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> and <PERSON>Flynn</PERSON> propelled 
the picking in new directions, most notably on the encore instrumental "Metric 
Lips," incorporating Irish and Eastern European folk influences into its 
staggered rhythms and complex movements. Though more orthodox, "Can't Stop Now" 
was no less impressive, with breakneck, jazz and blues-inflected solos 
rampaging seamlessly from instrument to instrument.

NIGHT LIFE: WARREN ZEVON: TOUR DE FARCE; 
</P>
<P>
THE GOOD HUMOR MAN OF ROCK, WITH A NEW BATCH OF BACKUP MUSICIANS, IS COMING TO 
VENTURA. 
</P>

He has 10 albums. He's funny and witty. He rocks. He sings as if he swallowed a 
badger and a Toro lawn mower. Famous rock stars play on his albums. He had a 
hit song about a werewolf. He's coming to the <LOCATION>Ventura Theatre</LOCATION> <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>. 
Hey, it must be <PERSON>Warren Zevon</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
The tour is billed as the <ORGANIZATION>Warren Zevon Acoustic Trio</ORGANIZATION>, or, according to <PERSON>Zevon</PERSON>, 
the <ORGANIZATION>Patrician Home Boys</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>Dan Dugmore</PERSON>, who plays with <PERSON>Linda Ronstadt</PERSON> and <PERSON>James 
Taylor</PERSON>, is the guitarist and Gurf Morlix from the <PERSON>Michael Penn Band</PERSON> is the 
final third. Either he has no friends or simply likes variety because <PERSON>Zevon</PERSON>'s 
backup musicians always change. "It's always been that way," <PERSON>Zevon</PERSON> said in a 
recent telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
A couple of albums ago, on "Sentimental Hygiene," <PERSON>Zevon</PERSON>'s supporting cast 
included <PERSON>Bob Dylan</PERSON>, <PERSON>Don Henley</PERSON>, <PERSON>Neil Young</PERSON>, <PERSON>Jennifer Warnes</PERSON>, <PERSON>George Clinton</PERSON>, 
<PERSON>Brian Setzer</PERSON> and three members of R.E.M. The latest album is an unrehearsed, 
let-the-tape-roll effort titled "Hindu Love Gods." This one features covers of 
classic blues rockers such as <PERSON>Willie Dixon</PERSON>'s "Wang Dang Doodle." There are also 
covers of tunes by <LOCATION>Prince</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Woody Gutherie</PERSON> and <PERSON>Robert Johnson</PERSON>. The album 
features the same three members of R.E.M. -- <PERSON>Bill Berry</PERSON>, <PERSON>Peter Buck</PERSON>, <PERSON>Mike Mills</PERSON> 
-- and no <PERSON>Michael Stipe</PERSON>. Maybe he's on loan to <PERSON>Wilson Phillips</PERSON>, who knows? 
</P>
<P>
"I've known those guys for years," <PERSON>Zevon</PERSON> said. "My manager for eight years, 
<PERSON>Andrew Slater</PERSON>, met <PERSON>Peter Buck</PERSON> when they were both in school at <ORGANIZATION>Emory University</ORGANIZATION> 
in <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION>. Anyway, the '<ORGANIZATION>Hindu Love Gods</ORGANIZATION>' thing was just this spontaneous, 
unplanned thing. And for whatever reason, it's selling surprisingly well. 
'<ORGANIZATION>Sentimental Hygiene</ORGANIZATION>' did OK, while the next one, '<ORGANIZATION>Transverse City</ORGANIZATION>,' was on the 
other side of OK. As a trio, we'll do some 'Hindu Love Gods' stuff, but mostly 
my songs." 
</P>
<P>
So what do they have planned for the local crowd? 
</P>
<P>
"There's no playlist or anything; we just do it and see what happens. For 
example, we were doing 'Ain't That Pretty at All' <TIME>last night</TIME> in <LOCATION>Seattle</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Joe 
Walsh</PERSON> came up from out of the crowd and jammed with us. Tonight, we're in <LOCATION>San 
Francisco</LOCATION> -- maybe we can do that song for four hours, if you know what I 
mean." 
</P>
<P>
A lifelong musician, <PERSON>Zevon</PERSON> switched from piano to guitar after high school and 
played folk rock for a while, then graduated into writing and performing 
commercials and playing as a studio musician. He toured with the <ORGANIZATION>Everly 
Brothers</ORGANIZATION> as a pianist in the early '70s, and released his first album in <DATE>1976</DATE> 
with help from his buddy, <PERSON>Jackson Browne</PERSON>. Ronstadt recorded several songs off 
the album, including "Poor, Poor Pitiful Me," which was a big hit for her. 
Zevon's next album, "Excitable Boy," contained his biggest hit so far, 
"Werewolves of <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>." 
</P>
<P>
"I've been playing music since I was a little kid," <PERSON>Zevon</PERSON> said. "When I was in 
junior high school in <LOCATION>San Pedro</LOCATION>, my teacher took me to meet <PERSON>Igor Stravinsky</PERSON>, 
who became sort of the Elvis influence for me. I also liked <PERSON>Bob Dylan</PERSON> and <PERSON>Van 
Morrison</PERSON> a lot. Then I got into the folk/hootenanny scene for a while, playing 
at the local pizza parlors and like that. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess the first time someone bought me a cheeseburger is when I technically 
became a professional. Later, I got to tour with the <ORGANIZATION>Everly Brothers</ORGANIZATION>. That was 
a dream job. I went all over the world with two guys who sang great every, 
single night. That was a lot more fun than the time I ended up singing country 
songs before 60,000 punks in <LOCATION>Denmark</LOCATION> waiting for U2." 
</P>
<P>
Zevon's witty lyrics are often buried by the ubiquitous loud guitars. Since he 
and the others will be performing as an acoustic trio this time, perhaps there 
will be more people laughing in the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really nice when the audience gets the joke," <PERSON>Zevon</PERSON> said. "And they 
usually do -- sometimes before I do. I love going on the road. It gets me out 
of my apartment in <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION>, and I'm able to write a lot of songs. At least 
that's what I tell the record company. As a trio, we'll just tour for a few 
months, then I'll start working on a new album the day I get back."

<TEXT>
   Back in the <DATE>1950s</DATE>, in <LOCATION>Bugaloosa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>La.</LOCATION>, a boy was
born to <LOCATION>Beauregard</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Beulah Poindexter</PERSON>, the famous song-and-dance
team; they named the child <PERSON>Buster</PERSON>.
   As the Poindexters toured the South, young Buster built up a
large following, giving uncanny impersonations of <PERSON>Carmen Miranda</PERSON> and
<ORGANIZATION>Louis Armstrong</ORGANIZATION> while drinking water out of a martini glass and
telling jokes with the skill of a seasoned veteran.
   But on <DATE>Easter Sunday</DATE> in <DATE>1959</DATE>, <PERSON>Beauregard</PERSON> was shot in a crooked
game of hearts by a man in a Stetson hat named Staggerlee, the
bullet shredding the queen of spades.
   Buster's desperate mother learned that actress <PERSON>Tallulah Bankhead</PERSON>
needed an assistant, and the Poindexters moved to <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>.
   No one knows what happened to <PERSON>Beulah Poindexter</PERSON> after that, but
<PERSON>Buster</PERSON> resurfaced in the <DATE>1980s</DATE> at a <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> club called Tramps,
drinking real martinis and performing standards and new songs
dressed in tie and tails.
   Audiences, young and old, responded to <PERSON>Poindexter</PERSON>, and in <DATE>1987</DATE>
the singer released his debut album, ``<PERSON>Buster Poindexter</PERSON>,'' a lively
collection of rock, jazz and soca that included the hit single
``Hot, Hot, Hot.''
   And so the imaginary life of <PERSON>Buster Poindexter</PERSON> goes.
   He's really <PERSON>David Johansen</PERSON>, former singer for the seminal punk
band The <ORGANIZATION>New York Dolls</ORGANIZATION>, and now a part-time actor (``Married to the
Mob'') who recently spoke of his two very different careers and
personalities.
   ``Buster's timeless,'' <PERSON>Johansen</PERSON> said. ``People who like the <LOCATION>New
York</LOCATION> Dolls dig what I'm doing now. The thing about <PERSON>Buster</PERSON> I dig is
that little kids like it, 5-year-old kids, 3-year-old kids. It's
like a character they can relate to.''
   On <PERSON>Poindexter</PERSON>'s new album, ``Buster Goes Berserk,'' he covers
``All Night Party,'' a '60s dance hit suggested by his baby sitter,
<PERSON>Wilson Pickett</PERSON>'s ``International Playboy'' and an obscure reggae
song, ``Poor People.''
   ``I'm prone not to record well-known songs; you can judge them
against something else,'' said <PERSON>Johansen</PERSON>, who reluctantly covered The
Animals' classic ``House of the Rising Sun'' on his first record.
   ``I'm in this network of people who make tapes of old stuff _
different genres of music. I make some of the best soca tapes in the
world. I got this guy in <LOCATION>L.A.</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fast Freddy</LOCATION>, the mambo king; he makes
some unbelieveable stuff.''
   Johansen grew up in <LOCATION>Staten Island</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>, in the '60s and listened
to all kinds of music, especially rhythm and blues.
   ``There were two soul stations,'' <PERSON>Johansen</PERSON> recalled, ``WWRL in
<LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION> and WNJR in <LOCATION>Newark</LOCATION> (N.J). WNJR, instead of just playing
the slick kind of soul songs, also played a lot of Southern soul _
<PERSON>Solomon Burke</PERSON>, Little <PERSON>Walter</PERSON>. Plus, I used to listen to (disc
jockey) <PERSON>Murray</PERSON> the K, and I'm a big fan of <ORGANIZATION>WBAI</ORGANIZATION>'s `World Dance
Party.'''
   The <ORGANIZATION>New York Dolls</ORGANIZATION> broke up after just two records, but
anticipated the English punk movement and American new wave scene of
the '70s with their combination of crude energy and ironic
intelligence. Johansen pursued a solo career, but tired of life on
the road.
   ``I used to live in the back of a van, which isn't so good for
your back, or your liver,'' he said. ``We'd been traveling eight
hours a day in a van and you'd go nuts, especially if you're going
to talk to some heavy metal guitarist all day. You'll go bananas _
some guy who's in love with <PERSON>George Jetson</PERSON>'s daughter, and you're
trying to explain to him that it's a cartoon.''
   Performing as <PERSON>Buster</PERSON> was meant originally as a temporary escape,
but the act's popularity _ especially on New Year's Eve _ made
recording an album a logical step.
   ``When I started it was just two guys: a piano player and me.
Then a drummer joined us, a guitar and bass,'' he said. ``I was just
going to do it for a month of <DATE>Mondays</DATE> at Tramps. We kept doing it
because people liked it. It built very naturally. We added the horns
and percussion and then decided to make the record.''
   His fast songs recall hot <DATE>summer</DATE> nights in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, with crowds
spilling out of nightclubs into the streets, but <PERSON>Poindexter</PERSON> also
switches moods with an occasional ballad, such as ``Deep in a
Dream.''
   ``My sense leans towards fun stuff, but I like to have a little
pathos as well. I see all kinds of images. The beach, all kinds of
stuff. The airport. I normally do a ballad at the end of the show.
For your third encore you do a ballad, otherwise people will never
leave.''
