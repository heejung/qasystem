   Aftershocks continued today as rescuers
struggled to free motorists from an elevated highway collapsed by
an earthquake that jarred <LOCATION>Northern California</LOCATION>, killing more than
270 people and injuring hundreds more.
   The quake <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, measuring 6.9 on the Richter scale,
collapsed buildings across the region as well as a section of the
<LOCATION>San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge</LOCATION> and at least two spans in the
<LOCATION>Santa Cruz</LOCATION> area. Severed gas lines sparked fires, including one in
<LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> that burned a block of buildings.
   The magnitude of the catastrophe emerged slowly as officials
made contact with hard-hit areas, where many telephones were cut
off. As many as 1 million people were left without power and other
services.
   ``This is just a devastating, terrible, terrible situation
beyond everybody's imagination,'' said <PERSON>Marty Boyer</PERSON>, the <LOCATION>Alameda
County</LOCATION> spokesman.
   Lt. Gov. <PERSON>Leo McCarthy</PERSON> <TIME>this morning</TIME> put the death toll at 271.
State emergency services spokesman <PERSON>John Peterson</PERSON> said at least 272
people had died and 650 were injured. At least 253 people were
killed when a half-mile section of the upper level of Interstate
880 in <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION> collapsed onto the lower level, said <PERSON>Dave Wilson</PERSON> of
the <ORGANIZATION>state Office of Emergency Services</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``You could hear it crunching down _ but you couldn't see
anything. It was just a big white cloud,'' said <PERSON>Leroy FitzGerald</PERSON>,
who works nearby. ``You could hear people screaming for help.''
   Tractors, bulldozers and dump trucks were called out, and trucks
and vans took bodies from the site <TIME>this morning</TIME>.
   The quake hit at <TIME>5:04 p.m.</TIME> <DATE>Tuesay</DATE> along a segment of the might
<LOCATION>San Andreas Fault</LOCATION> eight miles northeast of <LOCATION>Santa Cruz</LOCATION> and 75 miles
south of <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>. Aftershocks today included one measuring
4.5 on the Richter scale at <TIME>3:25 a.m.</TIME>, according to the <ORGANIZATION>National
Earthquake Information Center</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Golden</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Colo</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>McCarthy</PERSON> said damage would total ``the better part of a <MONEY>billion
dollars</MONEY>.''
   ``You could see dozens, huge booms of smoke going into the
air,'' said <PERSON>Greg Higgins</PERSON>, who was driving near <LOCATION>Santa Cruz</LOCATION>, close to
the quake's epicenter, when it struck. ``It was complete
pandemonium.''
   The quake sent thousands of terrified office workers rushing
into the streets of <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, and many remained
stranded hours later.
   ``I've never been through anything like this in my life,'' said
<PERSON>Mary Garcia</PERSON>, who works in <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Clorox</ORGANIZATION> building. ``I was on the
17th floor and the building just rocked and rocked. I was scared
out of my mind coming down the 17 floors.''
   Authorities urged people to fill their bathtubs in case water
was cut off. <LOCATION>San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos</LOCATION> urged commuters to stay
home today rather than further taxing the transportation system,
crippled by the closing of the Bay Bridge. A section of its top
collapsed onto the lower roadway.
   At least two bridges in the <LOCATION>Santa Cruz</LOCATION> area collapsed, highways
leading out of the city were damaged, and mountain passes outside
of <LOCATION>Santa Cruz</LOCATION> were closed because of landslides and fissures in the
road, the <ORGANIZATION>Highway Patrol</ORGANIZATION> said.
   In <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, at least eight people died, and looting and
vandalism were reported in the city's major crack dealing area
after dark. ``When the power is off, opportunists come out,''
police <PERSON>Dispatcher Chris Curran</PERSON> said.
   Agnos asked the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> to help. National Guardsmen were being
mobilized, including engineers, military police and medical workers.
   Still, <PERSON>Agnos</PERSON> said, ``The city is in reasonably good shape. We've
survived this so far.''
   Sixty-thousand baseball fans were evacuated from <LOCATION>Candlestick
Park</LOCATION> before the start of Game Three of the World Series. No major
injuries were reported at the stadium, which sustained structural
damage, and there was no word <TIME>this morning</TIME> on when the game would
be played.
   Fire engines and ambulances, sirens howling, picked their way
through a darkened <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>. Headlights and an occasional
office building running on emergency generators stood out. Buses
were jammed and traffic was backed up.
   Commuters were left with no major transportation routes east out
of <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> because of the closing of the Bay Bridge, two
other spans and the <LOCATION>Oakland-San Francisco</LOCATION> subway, which apparently
was unscathed by the quake.
   Tourist ferries helped fill the void, giving stranded commuters
free rides from <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> to the <LOCATION>East Bay</LOCATION>.
   People walked around <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, sat outside dingy hotels or
on stoops and curbs, listening to radio reports of the disaster.
Without power, there was no television. Restaurants and bars opened
with candlelight.
   Agnos said five people died in the city after buildings
collapsed on cars, and three died in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Marina</LOCATION>
district in a spectacular fire that burned much of the evening
before being brought under control.
   Up to 20 people were hurt in the fire, officials said.
   Police Chief <PERSON>Fred Jordan</PERSON> said the fire appeared to have consumed
an entire block, estimated by Agnos to be 12 buildings. The fire
apparently was caused by a natural gas leak, <PERSON>Agnos</PERSON> said.
   State emergency officials said at least five people died in
<LOCATION>Santa Cruz County</LOCATION>, including three crushed in collapsing buildings.
   One San Jose resident suffered a heart attack during the quake
and died.
   <PERSON>Willis Jacobs</PERSON> of the earthquake center said the quake was
centered about eight miles northeast of <LOCATION>Santa Cruz</LOCATION>, or 75 miles
south of <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, along the <LOCATION>San Andreas Fault</LOCATION>. That is the
major earthquake fault blamed for the <DATE>1906</DATE> disaster that destroyed
much of the city and killed hundreds _ 700, according to
traditional estimates, and more than 2,500, according to recent
studies.
   In <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>'s Haight-Fillmore district, cracks were visible
on some stoops and buildings, some in the stucco and some
structural. Many buildings in the neighborhood are Victorian-style
homes that survived the <DATE>1906</DATE> earthquake.
   A 30-foot section of the upper deck of the bridge connecting
<LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> collapsed, leaving three cars dangling
between the levels.
   <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION>California Highway Patrol</ORGANIZATION> reported a <ORGANIZATION>J.C. Penney</ORGANIZATION>
building in downtown <PERSON>Hollister</PERSON> collapsed, as did a bridge on a
highway near <LOCATION>Hollister</LOCATION>.
   Gov. <PERSON>George Deukmejian</PERSON> cut short a trade mission to <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION>, and flew home. ``The devastation is just horrible and
we're just shocked,'' <PERSON>Deukmejian</PERSON> said before returning.
   In <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> dispatched <ORGANIZATION>Transportation</ORGANIZATION>
Secretary <PERSON>Samuel Skinner</PERSON> to <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> to assess the damage. Vice
President <PERSON>Dan Quayle</PERSON> landed early today at <ORGANIZATION>Moffett Naval Air
Station</ORGANIZATION>, between <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION>.
   The quake was felt in <LOCATION>Reno</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Nev.</LOCATION>, 225 miles to the northeast; as
far north as the <LOCATION>Russian River</LOCATION> area, 70 miles to the north; 180
miles southeast in <LOCATION>Fresno</LOCATION> and 80 miles due east in <LOCATION>Stockton</LOCATION>.
High-rises in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, 350 miles south of <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, also
shook.
   At least four smaller aftershocks were recorded, said <PERSON>Bruce
Presgrave</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>National Earthquake Information Service</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Golden</LOCATION>.
More were expected, but <PERSON>Presgrave</PERSON> said he did not expect them to be
strong.
   There were no reports of damage to the Golden Gate Bridge that
connects <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Marin County</LOCATION>, to the north. The <LOCATION>San Mateo</LOCATION>
bridge, which crosses 10 miles south of <LOCATION>Candlestick Park</LOCATION>, was
closed for inspection, as was the <ORGANIZATION>Dumbarton Bridge</ORGANIZATION>, about 30 miles
south of <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>.
   The <LOCATION>Oakland Airport</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>San Francisco International Airport</LOCATION>
were both closed. The <LOCATION>San Jose International Airport</LOCATION> was open with
only minor damage.

   Howling winds clocked at up to 102 mph
battered <LOCATION>Northern California</LOCATION> on <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, claiming at least one
life, overturning trucks, toppling trees and cutting power to more
than 440,000 electric customers.
   The winds littered scenic <LOCATION>Northern California</LOCATION> with downed power
lines, branches and trash, and authorities closed dangerous highways
and issued travel warnings.
   The <LOCATION>San Francisco Bay</LOCATION> waterfront was ravaged by the winds, which
tore yachts adrift, sank several and sent waves up to 10 feet high
slamming into seawalls. A 60-foot floating dock at <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>'s
Pier 43 sank.
   ``We've had lots of trees knocked down, power outages and phone
problems,'' said <PERSON>Dan Nicholas</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Sonoma County Emergency Services</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Santa Rosa</LOCATION>, north of <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>. ``Some homes have been damaged
to the point where the people had to be evacuated and put up in
motels overnight.''
   Three-year-old <PERSON>Oli Asghar</PERSON> died <DATE>Thursday</DATE> in a <LOCATION>Berkeley</LOCATION> apartment
fire sparked by a candle used because of a wind-caused power outage.
His parents and three brothers and sisters were left homeless, fire
officials said.
   Some 442,000 <ORGANIZATION>Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co.</ORGANIZATION> customers throughout
<LOCATION>Northern California</LOCATION> were left in the dark by the winds, said
officials for the utility whose repair crews worked through the
<TIME>night</TIME>.
   ``This is definitely ... one of the largest outages because of
the velocity of the winds,'' said <ORGANIZATION>PG&amp;E</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>Ron Rutkowski</PERSON>.
   The winds also delayed the aircraft carrier USS <PERSON>Carl Vinson</PERSON> from
reaching its dock in <LOCATION>San Francisco Bay</LOCATION>. The carrier was scheduled to
arrive <DATE>Thursday</DATE> following a six-month tour, but <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> officials
postponed the homecoming until <DATE>Friday</DATE>.
   Winds weren't the only weather problem in <LOCATION>Northern California</LOCATION>.
Driving snow <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME> forced the closure of Highway 101
from <PERSON>Paso Robles</PERSON> to <PERSON>San Luis Obispo</PERSON>, a 30-mile stretch about 230
miles south of <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>.
   The winds were caused by the strong flow of air from a high
pressure system over <LOCATION>British Columbia</LOCATION> to a low pressure center in
<LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION>National Weather Service</ORGANIZATION>
meteorologist <PERSON>Randy Hartley</PERSON>.
   In northern <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION>, the same ``upper air'' weather system brought
gusting winds up to 115 mph to northern <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION>, said meteorologist
<PERSON>Bill Alder</PERSON>. Winds there felled power lines, toppled tractor-trailer
trucks, delayed mail deliveries, closed schools and fanned several
brush fires early <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Utah Power &amp; Light Co.</ORGANIZATION> crews worked into the afternoon to restore
electricity at the sites of scattered outages throughout a
four-county area.
   UP&amp;L spokesman <PERSON>Dave Mead</PERSON> said he had no firm estimate on the
number of people left without electricity, but said ``you certainly
would be safe saying several thousand.''
   In <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, power lines strewn across heavily traveled
<LOCATION>Lakeville</LOCATION> Highway near <LOCATION>Petaluma</LOCATION>, about 40 miles north of <LOCATION>San
Francisco</LOCATION>, forced authorities to close it overnight. Two private
planes at the <LOCATION>Petaluma</LOCATION> airport apparently were damaged by the winds,
said <PERSON>Nicholas</PERSON>.
   About 3,000 <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> personnel aboard the USS <PERSON>Carl Vinson</PERSON>, returning
from a six-month deployment to the <LOCATION>Western Pacific</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Indian Ocean and
North Arabian Sea</ORGANIZATION>, had their holiday port call delayed several hours
because of the winds.
   Petty Officer <PERSON>John Gwinn</PERSON>, aboard the huge ship, said he was eager
to reach shore where his wife, <PERSON>Sheree</PERSON>, and 3-month-old son, <PERSON>Robert</PERSON>,
were waiting.
   ``For me, it's hard. I've never seen my kid,'' he said.
   Winds clocked at more than 50 mph howled around <LOCATION>San Francisco Bay</LOCATION>
waterfronts, and the <ORGANIZATION>Coast Guard</ORGANIZATION> was kept busy retrieving small
boats torn from their moorings. Sausalito police said a tugboat sank
early <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   Famed attorney <PERSON>Melvin Belli</PERSON>'s 110-foot motor yacht ``Adequate
Award'' was also damaged when a boat dragged its anchor across
<LOCATION>Richardson Bay</LOCATION> and slammed into it at <ORGANIZATION>Schoonmaker Marina</ORGANIZATION>.
   A controlled-burn fire in <LOCATION>Tuolumne County</LOCATION> flared because of the
winds and burned 100 acres on <DATE>Thursday</DATE>. Several small fires were
also reported in the <ORGANIZATION>Stanislaus National Forest</ORGANIZATION>.
   Other wind-related problems included malfunctioning elevators in
<LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, delayed flights and re-routed air traffic at <LOCATION>San
Francisco International Airport</LOCATION> and closure of the Richmond-San
Rafael Bridge to pickups with camper shells and other broad-sided
vehicles.
   The winds, blowing northward, were clocked at 102 mph early
<DATE>Thursday</DATE> atop Mt. Diablo about 40 miles east of <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, where
remote sensing gear is located, said meteorologist <PERSON>Mike Pechner</PERSON>. The
wind hit 80 mph <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>. Hurricane force winds are 74 mph or
greater.

   A violent earthquake rocked <LOCATION>Northern
California</LOCATION> during <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> <TIME>evening</TIME>'s rush hour, caving in a section
of the <LOCATION>San Francisco Bay Bridge</LOCATION>, terrifying World Series fans in
<LOCATION>Candlestick Park</LOCATION> and shaking buildings as far as 200 miles away.
   CBS-TV reported one person had been killed on the bridge. There
were no other immediate confirmed reports of deaths or injuries,
but ABC-TV and CNN both said some people were injured at
<LOCATION>Candlestick</LOCATION>, where the game was canceled and fans were evacuated.
   It was not immediately clear how extensive the damage was from
the quake, which struck at <TIME>5:04 p.m. PDT</TIME> and registered 6.9 on the
Richter scale. It was centered near <LOCATION>Hollister</LOCATION>, 80 miles southeast
of <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>San Benito County</LOCATION>.
   ``The thing struck just as everyone was going home,'' said <PERSON>Tom
Mullins</PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION>California Office of Emergency
Services</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Sacramento</LOCATION>. ``We've got reports coming in from <LOCATION>San
Benito</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Santa Clara</LOCATION> counties of heavy damage.''
   <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION>California Highway Patrol</ORGANIZATION> reported a <ORGANIZATION>J.C. Penney</ORGANIZATION>
building in downtown <PERSON>Hollister</PERSON> collapsed and a bridge on Highway
101 in <LOCATION>Hollister</LOCATION> collapsed.
   There were unconfirmed reports that a shopping mall collapsed in
<LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION>, 50 miles south of <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>.
   <LOCATION>San Francisco Airport</LOCATION> was evacuated, and some people there were
hit with falling plaster.
   One major fire was blazing in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Marina District</LOCATION>
and another near the library at <ORGANIZATION>University of California</ORGANIZATION> at
<LOCATION>Berkeley</LOCATION>. A huge plume of smoke visible for miles over <LOCATION>Berkeley</LOCATION>.
   Hundreds of people fled <ORGANIZATION>Bay Area Rapid Transit</ORGANIZATION> subway and
elevated stations in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>East Bay</LOCATION> suburbs. The system
was shut down.
   Televised footage of the bridge connecting <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>San
Francisco</LOCATION> showed that a 30-foot section of the upper deck had
collapsed, leaving two cars dangling between the two levels.
Reports said most occupants got out of their cars safely.
   In <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> said the federal government was
prepared to send help to the earthquake area in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> and he
was sending <ORGANIZATION>Transportation</ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON>Samuel Skinner</PERSON> there to assess
the damage.
   At <ORGANIZATION>City Hall</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> a radio reporter told listeners,
``The entire building started to shake ... you could hear people
yelling and screaming all over the building.''
   She said there were ``obvious problems'' at the health
department across the street. ``Water was literally gushing out of
the building from a window on the second floor,'' the unidentified
reporter said.
   Citizens of <LOCATION>Marin</LOCATION>, north of <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, were warned to shut
off their gas because the smell of gas was all over town.
   <PERSON>Frank Baldwin</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Geological Survey's Earthquake Center</ORGANIZATION> said
the quake's magnitude was 6.9 on the Richter scale. It occurred at
<TIME>5:04 p.m. PDT</TIME> and was centered in the <LOCATION>Santa Cruz</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, area, 75
miles south of <LOCATION>San Francico</LOCATION> on the <LOCATION>Pacific Coast</LOCATION>.
   The quake was felt as far away as <ORGANIZATION>Reno</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Nev.</LOCATION>, 225 miles to the
northeast.
   The quake knocked out phones and power, including electricity at
<ORGANIZATION>The Associated Press</ORGANIZATION> bureau in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>.
   The <LOCATION>San Mateo</LOCATION> bridge, which crosses the bay about 10 miles south
of <LOCATION>Candlestick Park</LOCATION> was closed for inspection.
   <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> Police Officer <PERSON>Dwayne Collins</PERSON> said there were
reports that buildings and statues in the historic <LOCATION>South of Market</LOCATION>
district near downtown had collapsed.
   ``I thought I was losing my balance, then I saw the lamppost
sway one foot each direction. Then I saw falling glass, broken
glass on the street, but luckily not near me, `` said Les Galvacs
who was walking down Market Street in downtown <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>David Balague</PERSON>, 22, was on the 14th floor of the <ORGANIZATION>Bank of America</ORGANIZATION>
building. ``I've never been so scared. People were fighting to get
under the desks.''
   Fans at Candlestick screamed as the stadium swayed shortly
before the <LOCATION>San Francisco Giants</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Oakland Athletics</ORGANIZATION> were to have
begun the third game of the World Series.
   ``This upper deck was absolutely shaking, the light stanchions
were blowing back and forth, phones have gone out,'' <PERSON>Suzyn Waldman</PERSON>,
a reporter covering the World Series for WFAN-AM in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> told
listeners shortly after the quake hit. ``Everyone is standing
around here, people in the upper deck absolutely terrified to move
not knowing what to do.''
   A man in <LOCATION>Saratoga</LOCATION>, southwest of <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION>, told a <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>
radio station, ``My house is OK, but everything in it is gone. My
refrigerator is standing in the middle of the kitchen.'' He said
10,000 gallons of water from his swimming pool crashed through his
picture window into his home.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude. Thus a reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times
stronger than one of 6.5.
   An earthquake of 6 on the scale can cause severe damage. A 7
reading is a ``major'' earthquake, capable of widespread heavy
damage. The <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> earthquake of <DATE>1906</DATE>, which occurred before
the Richter scale was devised, has been estimated at 8.3 on the
Richter scale.

   Aftershocks to <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>'s killer quake
shook the battered <LOCATION>San Francisco Bay</LOCATION> area today as work crews gave
up hope of finding anyone alive beneath a wrecked freeway and
stunned Californians struggled to put order back in their lives.
   At least 272 people were reported killed and 1,400 injured in
the catastrophic earthquake, which in 15 seconds wrecked buildings
across nearly 100 miles. A section of the Bay Bridge and at least
two spans near <LOCATION>Santa Cruz</LOCATION> fell, and electric power was cut for as
many as 1 million residents.
   Severed gas lines touched off fires, including one in <LOCATION>San
Francisco</LOCATION> that burned a block of buildings, but all the blazes were
out or under control today.
   Extensive damage was reported in parts of <LOCATION>Santa Cruz</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>San
Benito</LOCATION> counties 70 miles to the south, which were closest to the
epicenter of the earthquake.
   The quake, 6.9 on the Richter scale, was the second-deadliest in
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> history, surpassed only by the great <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> earthquake
of <DATE>1906</DATE>, when 2,500 or more were killed.
   The magnitude of the disaster emerged slowly today as officials
made contact with hard-hit areas _ outlying suburbs and towns where
many telephones were cut off.
   ``The devastation is just horrible,'' said Gov. <PERSON>George
Deukmejian</PERSON>, who cut short a trade mission to <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION>. Lt. Gov.
<PERSON>Leo McCarthy</PERSON> said damage would total ``the better part of <MONEY>$1
billion</MONEY>.''
   <LOCATION>San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos</LOCATION> urged commuters to stay home
rather than tax the transportation system, crippled by the closing
of the Bay Bridge. But as dawn spread over the glass-strewn streets
of the region, people tried to revive a sense of normalcy, some
making their way to work by ferry, by foot or over highways not
blocked by damage. The Bay Area Rapid Transit system reopened <TIME>this
morning</TIME>, as did the <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> airports.
   Many people stayed home, however, their workplaces shut down in
the quake's aftermath. Most schools and many other institutions
were closed as well.
   <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>'s financial district was unusually quiet. The
<ORGANIZATION>Pacific Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> opened, but business was slow as traders
worked by candlelight, flashlight and light filtering through
skylights.
   Traffic was light on bridges into <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> and in most city
neighborhoods.
   A <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> city councilman, <PERSON>Bill Maher</PERSON>, said electric power
had been restored to about two-thirds of the city by morning and
should be fully restored by the end of the day.
   ``The city is in reasonably good shape,'' <PERSON>Agnos</PERSON> said. ``We've
survived this so far.''
   The mayor estimated 40 buildings in the city were unusable or
severely damaged.
   Pacific <PERSON>Bell</PERSON> said its telephone network suffered no significant
damage, but the system was being overloaded by a huge increase in
calls into and out of the region.
   In a grimly futile operation near <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION>'s bayfront, crews
worked to clear concrete debris and searched for victims along a
mile-long portion of Interstate 880, the <ORGANIZATION>Nimitz Freeway</ORGANIZATION>, whose
upper level collapsed on a lower roadway crowded with rush hour
traffic.
   <PERSON>Dave Wilson</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>state Office of Emergency Services</ORGANIZATION> said at
least 253 people died in the highway disaster. Authorities declined
to say how many bodies had been recovered, but said they based
their estimate on the number of cars believed crushed in the
debris. They said seven victims had been identified.
   Some people were pulled alive from the wreckage after the quake,
but <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON>Lionel Wilson</PERSON> said <DATE>today</DATE> searchers believed no
more survivors remained.
   Tractors, bulldozers and dump trucks were called out <TIME>this
morning</TIME>, and trucks and vans took bodies from the site.
   ``You could hear it crunching down _ but you couldn't see
anything. It was just a big white cloud,'' witness <PERSON>Leroy FitzGerald</PERSON>
said of the collapse. ``You could hear people screaming for help.''
   A 30-foot section of the <LOCATION>San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge</LOCATION>'s top
level also collapsed, dropping onto a lower roadway and leaving
three cars dangling.
   State emergency services spokesman <PERSON>Tom Mullins</PERSON> said at
midafternoon that at least 272 people had died overall and 1,400
were injured.
   The <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> coroner's office said <DATE>today</DATE> it had confirmed
10 earthquake-related deaths. Authorities reported five deaths in
<LOCATION>Santa Clara County</LOCATION> and one in <LOCATION>San Mateo County</LOCATION>, areas just to the
south of <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>.
   Officials in <LOCATION>Santa Cruz County</LOCATION> said five people were killed
around the coastal city of <LOCATION>Santa Cruz</LOCATION>.
   In <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> signed a disaster-relief
declaration and said ``we will take every step and make every
effort'' to help. Vice President <PERSON>Dan Quayle</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Transportation</ORGANIZATION>
Secretary <PERSON>Samuel Skinner</PERSON> flew over the area for about an hour today
to survey the damage.
   The president said he would make a personal inspection in a few
days. <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> officials said <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> probably would go on <DATE>Friday</DATE>
or <DATE>Saturday</DATE>.
   The quake hit at <TIME>5:04 p.m.</TIME> <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> along a segment of the huge
<LOCATION>San Andreas Fault</LOCATION> eight miles northeast of <LOCATION>Santa Cruz</LOCATION> and 75 miles
south of <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>. Dozens of aftershocks followed, including
one that measured 5.9 on the Richter scale shortly after the main
shock.
   The quake was felt in <LOCATION>Reno</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Nev.</LOCATION>, 225 miles to the northeast,
and high-rises shook in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, 350 miles south of <LOCATION>San
Francisco</LOCATION>.
   Forty buildings reportedly collapsed in <LOCATION>Santa Cruz</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Watsonville</LOCATION>; <LOCATION>Santa Cruz County</LOCATION> emergency services coordinator <PERSON>Dina
Phillips</PERSON> estimated <MONEY>$350 million</MONEY> in damage. <PERSON>Lori Aldrete</PERSON> of the
<ORGANIZATION>California Association of Hospitals</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Sacramento</LOCATION> said the
<ORGANIZATION>Watsonville Community Hospital</ORGANIZATION> was evacuated, but no other details
were available.
   In <LOCATION>Los Gatos</LOCATION>, about 10 miles southwest of <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION>, Police Chief
<PERSON>Larry Todd</PERSON> said many buildings had collapsed, and there were some
reports of looting.
   At least two bridges in the <LOCATION>Santa Cruz</LOCATION> area collapsed, highways
leading out of the city were damaged, and mountain passes outside
<LOCATION>Santa Cruz</LOCATION> were closed due to landslides and fissures in the road,
the <ORGANIZATION>Highway Patrol</ORGANIZATION> said.
   The quake sent thousands of terrified office workers rushing
into the streets of <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>.
   ``I've never been through anything like this in my life,'' said
<PERSON>Mary Garcia</PERSON>, who works in <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Clorox</ORGANIZATION> building. ``I was on the
17th floor and the building just rocked and rocked. I was scared
out of my mind coming down the 17 floors.''
   Looting and vandalism were reported in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>'s major
crack dealing area, along Third Street. ``When the power is off,
opportunists come out,'' said police <PERSON>Dispatcher Chris Curran</PERSON>.
   Agnos asked the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> to help. National Guardsmen were being
mobilized, including engineers, military police and medical workers.
   Sixty-thousand baseball fans were evacuated from <LOCATION>Candlestick
Park</LOCATION> before the start of Game Three of the World Series. No major
injuries were reported at the stadium, which sustained structural
damage. Baseball Commissioner <PERSON>Fay Vincent</PERSON> said no decision had been
made on when or where to resume the Series.
   There were no reports of damage to the state's six nuclear
reactors, said <PERSON>Greg Cook</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Nuclear Regulatory Commission</ORGANIZATION> spokesman.
   The 6.9 Richter reading made this the sixth-most powerful quake
to strike <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> this century, and the most powerful since a
7.0 quake centered in <LOCATION>Eureka</LOCATION> in <DATE>1980</DATE>.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude. An earthquake of 6 can cause severe damage. A 7 is a
``major'' quake, capable of widespread heavy damage. The <DATE>1906</DATE>
earthquake, which occurred before the scale was devised, has been
estimated at 8.3.

   A moderate earthquake rattled <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION> a day after
snow and sleet blanketed the fire-blackened region, while
hurricane-force winds pounded <LOCATION>Northern California</LOCATION>, cutting power to
hundreds of thousands and leading to three children's deaths.
   The winds, clocked at up to 102 mph, died down <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>,
shortly before the temblor hit 500 miles to the southeast in a state
suffering in recent weeks from an attack of nature's worst elements.
   The winds fanned fires, uprooted trees and overturned trucks.
More than 575,000 <ORGANIZATION>Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co.</ORGANIZATION> customers lost power
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> and <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, said utility spokeswoman <PERSON>Jan Stewart</PERSON>.
By <DATE>late Thursday</DATE>, 22,000 remained without electricity. The wind also
knocked out power to more than 14,000 people in <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION>.
   Two people died as dozens of cars crashed <DATE>Thursday</DATE> in 10
accidents along ice-slick Interstate 15 in the Cajon Pass 55 miles
east of <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION>Highway Patrol</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>John Savage</PERSON>.
   ``One of the problems is here we don't have the snow equipment to
take care of this _ it doesn't happen here,'' said Highway Patrol
Officer <PERSON>Frank Stricker</PERSON>.
   Snow up to 7 inches deep closed lanes of Interstate 5 over <LOCATION>Tejon
Pass north of Los Angeles</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>'s main north-south route, and
coastal Highway 101 near <LOCATION>San Luis Obispo</LOCATION> about 150 miles north of
the city.
   Thousands of motorists were stranded, travel elsewhere was
difficult and some schools in <LOCATION>San Luis Obispo County</LOCATION> were closed,
officials said.
   Weather forecasters predicted much of the same through the
<DATE>weekend</DATE>, saying 1 to 2 feet of snow was possible in southern
mountain ranges.
   The earthquake late <DATE>Thursday</DATE> rattled windows and knocked wall
hangings askew from <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Palm Springs</LOCATION> 110 miles to the
east. There were no immediate reports of serious damage or injuries.
   The quake registered a moderate 4.8 on the Richter scale and was
centered 13 miles northwest of <LOCATION>Palm Springs</LOCATION>, said <PERSON>Hall Daly</PERSON>, a
spokesman for <ORGANIZATION>California Institute of Technology</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Pasadena</LOCATION>.
   Just <DATE>a week earlier</DATE> the <LOCATION>Los Angeles Basin</LOCATION> was swept by warm,
fierce <LOCATION>Santa Ana</LOCATION> winds. Wind-fanned fires burned dozens of homes in
two suburbs <DATE>Dec. 8</DATE> and blackened 3,000 acres of brushy terrain the
next day.
   In northern <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION>, canyon winds gusting to 115 mph knocked out
power to 50,000 people <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> and <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, and 3,000 remained
without power late <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, said <ORGANIZATION>Utah Power &amp; Light</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>Dave
Mead</PERSON>.
   Twenty-four schools and the <ORGANIZATION>Internal Revenue Service</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Ogden</LOCATION>
closed. At least five tractor-trailer rigs were blown over in <LOCATION>Davis
County</LOCATION> near <LOCATION>Great Salt Lake</LOCATION> and mail delivery in northern <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION> was
delayed or halted, officials said.
   In <LOCATION>Northern California</LOCATION>, power outages led to two deadly
candle-sparked fires, officials said. In <LOCATION>Berkeley</LOCATION>, 3-year-old <PERSON>Oli
Asghar</PERSON> died <DATE>Thursday</DATE> and his family was left homeless.
   In <LOCATION>Pittsburg</LOCATION>, about 30 miles to the north, 6-year-old <PERSON>Mounkoun
Lee</PERSON> died <DATE>late Wednesday</DATE> of smoke inhalation after he was trapped
inside his burning home. His 5-year-old sister, <PERSON>Angela</PERSON>, died at
<ORGANIZATION>Children's Hospital</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>.
   It caught fire after her parents neglected to extinguish a candle
next to a bed they were using for light when wind knocked out power,
officials said.
   In <LOCATION>Sonoma County</LOCATION> north of <LOCATION>San Francisco Bay</LOCATION>, ``we've had lots of
trees knocked down, power outages and phone problems,'' said <PERSON>Dan
Nicholas</PERSON> of county <ORGANIZATION>Emergency Services</ORGANIZATION>. ``Some homes have been
damaged to the point where the people had to be evacuated and put up
in motels overnight.''
   On the bay's long waterfront, the winds sent waves up to 10 feet
high slamming into seawalls and sank a 60-foot floating dock at <LOCATION>San
Francisco</LOCATION>'s Pier 43. Piles of metal and other debris were left on
streets.
   A tugboat sank in <LOCATION>Richardson Bay</LOCATION> near <LOCATION>Sausalito</LOCATION>, two boats sank
at a <LOCATION>China Basin</LOCATION> dock just south of downtown <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, and the
<ORGANIZATION>Coast Guard</ORGANIZATION> kept busy retrieving small boats torn from their
moorings, officials said. Famed attorney <PERSON>Melvin Belli</PERSON>'s 110-foot
yacht, Adequate Award, was damaged when another boat dragging its
anchor slammed into his in <LOCATION>Richardson Bay</LOCATION>.
   Much bigger craft had problems as well. The aircraft carrier USS
<PERSON>Carl Vinson</PERSON> and its 3,000-man crew,wrapping up a six-month tour, had
to delay a holiday port call until today, said Petty Officer <PERSON>Roger
Turner</PERSON>.
   The wind blew out store windows in <LOCATION>Berkeley</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Hayward</LOCATION>,
and shattered glass blocked major roadways.
   Several trucks along a 10-mile stretch of Interstate 580
southeast of <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> were toppled, the <ORGANIZATION>Highway Patrol</ORGANIZATION> said.
   A downed power line in <LOCATION>Sonoma County</LOCATION>'s geysers area sparked a
fire that burned 250 acres, but threatened no homes. In <LOCATION>Tuolumne
County</LOCATION> near the <LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION> border, a controlled-burn fire flared and
blackened 100 acres. Several small fires were reported in the
<ORGANIZATION>Stanislaus National Forest</ORGANIZATION>.
   The winds also delayed flights and diverted air traffic to and
from <LOCATION>San Francisco International Airport</LOCATION> and caused elevators to
malfunction in the city.

   A sharp earthquake shook the <LOCATION>San Francisco
Bay</LOCATION> area for 10 seconds early today, breaking glass, causing rock
slides and apparently prompting a man to jump to his death from a
fifth-story window, authorities said.
   The quake, measuring 5.1 on the Richter scale, occurred at <TIME>1:13
a.m.</TIME> and was centered on the <LOCATION>San Andreas Fault</LOCATION> about 13 miles south
of <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Geological Survey</ORGANIZATION>. It was felt as far as
San <PERSON>Luis Obispo</PERSON>, 230 miles south of here.
   No major damage was reported.
   The quake struck as state and federal emergency officials were
about to begin a two-day test of earthquake communications
procedures. The drill involved a mock earthquake in the <LOCATION>Bay</LOCATION> area in
which 5,000 people die.
   ``It felt like I was having my bed rolled around on a
skateboard. I woke up and I was moving,'' said <PERSON>Henry J. Peterson</PERSON> of
<LOCATION>Santa Clara</LOCATION>, next to <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION>.
   Two aftershocks measuring 4.2 and 4.5 rippled through the <TIME>area
later this morning</TIME>. State officials warned there could be more
quakes in <LOCATION>northern California</LOCATION> in the next five days, with a quake
up to 6.2 possible but not likely.
   In <LOCATION>Los Gatos</LOCATION>, 50 miles south of <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, a 19-year-old man
was apparently startled awake by the earthquake and jumped out of
his bedroom window, police dispatcher <PERSON>Lisa Douglas</PERSON> said in a
statement.
   The shaking sent rocks tumbling onto highways, said a <ORGANIZATION>Santa Cruz
County Sheriff's Department</ORGANIZATION> emergency dispatcher who declined to
give her name. ``They cleared the debris by hand and all roads are
now cleared,'' she said.
   ``There was some damage in the <LOCATION>Santa Cruz Mountains</LOCATION>,'' said <LOCATION>San
Jose</LOCATION> police Officer <PERSON>Jay Forbes</PERSON>. ``It was mainly broken windows and
mirrors. Nothing serious.''
   The false ceiling in a vacant <LOCATION>Los Gatos</LOCATION> business came down, and
half a dozen businesses reported broken windows, police said.
   ``I felt a little rumble and then all the windows started
shaking real bad,'' said <PERSON>Chris Soliday</PERSON>, a clerk at an all-night
convenience store in <LOCATION>Sunnyvale</LOCATION>. ``Some stuff in the aisles fell
down. There's broken glass, dented cans, some beer bottles broken.''
   The epicenter was in almost exactly the same place as a 5.0
quake on <DATE>June 27, 1988</DATE>, said <ORGANIZATION>USGS</ORGANIZATION> geophysicist <PERSON>Dave Oppenheimer</PERSON>.
   Residents shaken awake by the temblor described it as jolting
and rolling.
   ``It was the strongest I've ever felt,'' said <PERSON>Bernie Beck</PERSON>, 38,
who lives in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Haight-Ashbury</LOCATION> district.
   ``I live in an old building that was built after the <DATE>1906</DATE> quake,
and it really had me going,'' <PERSON>Beck</PERSON> said. ``It felt like you were
sitting on a saw horse, rocking back and forth.''
   <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>'s Great Quake, which occurred in <DATE>1906</DATE> before the
Richter scale was devised, has been estimated at 8.3. Recent
estimates say more than 2,000 people died in the quake and the fire
it touched off, which burned much of the city.
   The open-ended Richter scale is a measure of the energy released
by an earthquake, as measured by ground motion recorded on a
seisomograph.
   Each increase of one number, as in a jump from magnitude 5.5 to
6.5, means that the ground motion is 10 times greater. A quake of
3.5 can cause slight damage in populated areas, while a quake of
6.0 can cause severe damage. In <DATE>March 1964</DATE> an earthquake in <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION>
hit 8.5 on the Richter scale, killing 114 people.

A massive earthquake struck south of <LOCATION>San Francisco Bay</LOCATION> on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, killing at 
least six, injuring hundreds more, damaging thousands of buildings and 
collapsing a portion of the roadway decking on the <LOCATION>San Francisco-Oakland Bay 
Bridge</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The quake, which hit at <TIME>5:04 p.m.</TIME> and lasted about 15 seconds, measured at 
magnitude 6.9, four times stronger than the powerful <LOCATION>Sylmar</LOCATION> quake that rocked 
the northern <LOCATION>San Fernando Valley</LOCATION> <DATE>Feb. 9, 1971</DATE>, killing 58 and causing more than 
<MONEY>$1 billion</MONEY> damage. 
</P>
<P>
An apartment building covering an entire city block caught fire in <LOCATION>San 
Francisco</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Marina District</LOCATION>. The flames spread unchecked, enveloping the entire 
structure, which eventually collapsed in embers. Several nearby buildings 
appeared threatened. 
</P>
<P>
At the recently renovated <LOCATION>San Francisco International Airport</LOCATION>, ceilings 
collapsed and tumbled into crowded passengers areas. 
</P>
<P>
The earthquake, which was felt as far as 300 miles away, knocked out electrical 
power, television broadcasts and telephone communications across hundreds of 
miles. 
</P>
<P>
The quake struck as thousands of fans were crowding into <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>'s 
Candlestick Park for the third game of the <DATE>1989</DATE> World Series. The game was 
canceled and players reportedly left the stadium in their uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
Network broadcasters monitoring the pregame activities from other cities saw 
the game go off the air and spread word of the disaster to the millions across 
the nation preparing to watch at the game on television. 
</P>
<P>
Several spectators at <LOCATION>Candlestick Park</LOCATION> were injured by falling debris. 
Officials ordered the stadium evacuated. 
</P>
<P>
Several motorists were tossed from the Bay Bridge into the water, more than 100 
feet blow, when the temblor collapsed a 50-foot section of the roadway. The 
extent of their injuries was not immediately determined. 
</P>
<P>
Several other major roadways suffered heavy damage. A section of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> 101, one 
of the main arteries to the south, buckled in several places near <LOCATION>San Francisco 
Airport</LOCATION>. A double-decked portion of Interstate 880 in the <LOCATION>East Bay</LOCATION> appeared to 
have collapsed. It is a main commuter freeway connecting <LOCATION>East Oakland</LOCATION> with the 
<ORGANIZATION>Oakland-San Francisco Bay Bridge</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Ambulances, their sirens screaming, attempted to race through gridlocked 
streets toward downtown <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, where several major buildings collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
Evening rush-hour traffic came to a halt, with traffic signals knocked out 
throughout much of the area. Many commuters left their cars in parking lots and 
tried to go home by foot. Market Street was filled with people as aftershocks 
continued. 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>San Francisco City Hall</LOCATION> and the state building housing the <ORGANIZATION>state Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> 
were evacuated. Both buildings had severe damage inside. 
</P>
<P>
Close to the Civic Center, a large section of a four-story building came down, 
and eyewitnesses said the bodies of at least two women were removed. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole topside, I saw the building coming down, and I just went forward, 
trying to get out of there," said <PERSON>Cliff Bailey</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> Fire Capt. <PERSON>John Traversaro</PERSON> said that "four or five people, it 
could be considerably more" were killed in this building alone. 
</P>
<P>
At the nearby federal building, <PERSON>Marcus Williams</PERSON> said, "I didn't want to be 
buried alive. As I ran down the stairs, people were screaming. This was the 
worst one I ever felt." 
</P>
<P>
At the <ORGANIZATION>state Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION>, Justice <PERSON>David M. Eagleson</PERSON> said, "There were 
pictures knocked off the walls, books on the floor and cracked plaster. We were 
really hit. Things are really a mess." 
</P>
<P>
Justice <PERSON>Allen E. Broussard</PERSON> said he was completing a meeting with staff 
attorneys when the temblor hit. "There was so much dust in the air you could 
hardly see what happened," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was horrible on the Muni Metro," said <PERSON>Kim Gordon</PERSON>, an insurance company 
employee who was riding <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>'s subway system. "We were underground and 
it was shaking real bad. We all thought we were going to die." 
</P>
<P>
She said that when her train arrived at the next station, the passengers were 
let out but had to grope their way to the surface in the dark. 
</P>
<P>
Seismologists at <ORGANIZATION>UC Berkeley</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Caltech</ORGANIZATION> put the epicenter on the <LOCATION>San Andreas 
Fault</LOCATION>, 10 miles north of <LOCATION>Santa Cruz</LOCATION> in the same vicinity of a 5.4 quake that 
struck in <DATE>August</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Damage and injuries in the communities surrounding the epicenter were said to 
be extensive, with people trapped in damaged buildings in <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION> and further 
south in <LOCATION>Hollister</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
A <ORGANIZATION>Hayward</ORGANIZATION> couple, <PERSON>Steve</PERSON> and <PERSON>Christie Stevenson</PERSON>, said they tried to run out of 
their front door, but "it was impossible to run." <PERSON>Steve Stevenson</PERSON> said they 
"held onto a tree in the front yard and watched the water in the swimming poor 
come out in three-foot waves." 
</P>
<P>
In <LOCATION>Sacramento</LOCATION>, Gov. <PERSON>George Deukmejian</PERSON>'s press secretary, <PERSON>Kevin Brett</PERSON>, said the 
governor had been awakened in <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION>, where he had gone on a 
trade mission, at about <TIME>1:15 a.m.</TIME> <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION> time. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Brett</PERSON> said it had not yet been decided whether the governor would cancel the 
rest of his trip and return to the state. 
</P>
<P>
The historic <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> earthquake of <DATE>1906</DATE> was estimated later by 
seismologists to have reached a magnitude of 8.3. By that scale, each number 
represents a 10-fold increase in magnitude -- meaning that the earlier quake 
was considerably more than 10 times stronger than <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>'s. 
</P>
<P>
The <DATE>1906</DATE> quake devastated the city. In the three days that followed that quake, 
fires destroyed 490 blocks within a four-square-mile area near the financial 
district. Five hundred were killed, thousands were injured and more than 28,000 
buildings ultimately were lost. In <DATE>1906</DATE> dollars, damage was estimated at <MONEY>$400 
million</MONEY>.

<P>
In between emergency responses from our fire station, I watched the heroic 
efforts of our brother and sister firefighters in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> as they 
attempted to suppress the fires and rescue people trapped in structures. The 
mayor had put out a call for all off-duty fire fighting personnel to 
immediately report to their fire stations. 
</P>
<P>
While watching the coverage, my mind kept drifting back to an obscure article I 
had read earlier in the day. This article described how <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> Mayor Art 
Agnos had reduced the <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> Fire Department staffing by 76 positions 
four months earlier. I kept waiting for someone to ask Agnos about these 
reductions, but no questions were forthcoming. 
</P>
<P>
There is no doubt that the remaining personnel of the <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> Fire 
Department would give their all during this major disaster, but when the dust 
is settled, I am sure they will ask Agnos if he still feels the same way about 
his cuts in the fire department -- and I can't wait to hear his answer!

SCIENTISTS LAST YEAR HAD PINPOINTED TUESDAY'S SITE AS LIKELY TO BE JOLTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
<DATE>Tuesday</DATE>'s earthquake, the strongest on the <LOCATION>San Andreas</LOCATION> fault since the <LOCATION>San 
Francisco</LOCATION> quake on <DATE>April 18, 1906</DATE>, came in a place that had been identified by 
scientists just last year as the most likely spot for a major jolt in <LOCATION>Northern 
California</LOCATION> within the next 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
The epicenter of the temblor, eight miles east-northeast of the city of <LOCATION>Santa 
Cruz</LOCATION> in the <LOCATION>Santa Cruz Mountains</LOCATION>, was at virtually the same spot as earthquakes 
in the 5-magnitude range that occurred on <DATE>June 27, 1988</DATE>, and <DATE>Aug. 8, 1989</DATE>. A 
6.5-magnitude quake was centered there in <DATE>1865</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Geological Survey</ORGANIZATION>, in a <DATE>1988</DATE> report on regions of high earthquake 
probability in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, said there was a <PERCENT>30%</PERCENT> chance of another 6.5-magnitude 
earthquake in the immediate vicinity by the year <DATE>2018</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
The report cited even higher probabilities for major temblors on the <LOCATION>San 
Andreas</LOCATION> near <LOCATION>Parkfield</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>central California</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Coachella</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Southern 
California</LOCATION> in the same period, but it pinpointed the <LOCATION>Santa Cruz</LOCATION> mountains as 
the most vulnerable spot in <LOCATION>Northern California</LOCATION>, in part because the area 
marked the southernmost point of maximum ground slippage during the <DATE>1906</DATE> 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
A period of 83 years is short as far as earthquake intervals go, and during 
this time, scientists said <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>, pressure was probably building up in 
the southern neighboring segment of the <LOCATION>San Andreas</LOCATION>, which had not slipped as 
much. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Thomas Heaton</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>Geological Survey</ORGANIZATION> scientist in charge of the agency's 
<LOCATION>Pasadena</LOCATION> field office, said that the <DATE>1987</DATE> and <DATE>1988</DATE> earthquakes now must be seen 
as "preshocks" of the <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>'s 6.9 temblor. He said "foreshocks" would not be 
the proper term, since months had elapsed before the more powerful earthquake 
struck. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Heaton</PERSON> said that a still larger shock is unlikely. But he joined <ORGANIZATION>Caltech</ORGANIZATION> 
scientists in saying that aftershocks as strong as 5.9 magnitude should be 
expected, and that the pattern of aftershocks could last for months. A 5.9 
aftershock would be as strong as the <DATE>1987</DATE> Whittier quake in the <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> 
area. 
</P>
<P>
After both the <DATE>1987</DATE> and the <DATE>1988</DATE> earthquakes in the <LOCATION>Santa Cruz mountains</LOCATION>, the 
<ORGANIZATION>state Office of Emergency Services</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Geological Survey</ORGANIZATION> issued 
warnings of increased risk of sizable shakes, ranging up to 6.5 magnitude, 
within the next few days in the vicinity. 
</P>
<P>
But these warnings said that if nothing happened, then the chances of a major 
earthquake would recede to normal for the vicinity. The trouble was, the area 
was more prone to quakes at this time than any other place in the <LOCATION>Bay Area</LOCATION> on 
the <LOCATION>San Andreas Fault</LOCATION>. Only the nearby Hayward fault may harbor as great a 
danger of a catastrophic earthquake in the <LOCATION>Bay Area</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The <LOCATION>San Andreas</LOCATION>, the longest and best-known earthquake fault in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, 
extends from <ORGANIZATION>Point Arena</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Mendocino County</LOCATION> to the <LOCATION>Salton Sea</LOCATION>. It has been the 
site of the deadliest and most destructive earthquakes in the state's recorded 
history. 
</P>
<P>
Although <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>'s quake was powerful, <LOCATION>Waverly Person</LOCATION>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION>National 
Earthquake Information Service</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Golden</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Colo.</LOCATION>, cautioned that at 6.9 
magnitude, it should be considered only a "strong" shock, not a "major" one, as 
a quake in the 7.0 to 7.9 range would be classified, or a "great" one, as a 
quake of 8.0 or above would be. 
</P>
<P>
Person and others in the <ORGANIZATION>Geological Survey</ORGANIZATION> warned <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> that the 
probability is <PERCENT>40%</PERCENT> that a temblor more powerful than <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>'s will strike in 
<LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION> sometime in the next three decades. 
</P>
<P>
But, as it was, <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>'s quake was about four times stronger than the 
devastating Sylmar-San Fernando earthquake of <DATE>1971</DATE> and 10 times stronger than 
the <DATE>1987</DATE> Whittier quake. Each point of magnitude represents a 10-fold increase 
in the power of an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
Person said that, like most <LOCATION>San Andreas</LOCATION> earthquakes, this was most likely to be 
a strike-slip quake, with one side of the fault grinding horizontally past 
another. But he said a final evaluation would have to await on-scene inspection 
teams that will be sent into the epicenter area today by the <ORGANIZATION>Geological 
Survey</ORGANIZATION>'s Menlo Park office. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Jim Dewey</PERSON>, a research geophysicist at the <ORGANIZATION>National Earthquake Center</ORGANIZATION>, said 
preliminary evaluations indicated that the fracture was about 10 miles deep, 
and that the quake rupture extended about 30 miles south down the fault from 
the epicenter. 
</P>
<P>
Person said that the area of strongest shaking was around <LOCATION>Santa Cruz</LOCATION>, although 
this evaluation too will have to await field evaluations, as will a final 
confirmation of the magnitude of the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
The nearest metropolitan area to <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>'s earthquake, <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION>, has seen 
nearly a dozen earthquakes of 5 magnitude or greater in the <DATE>last 10 years</DATE>, but 
several of them have been on the Calaveras fault, which generally runs just 
east of <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION>, more than 10 miles east of <LOCATION>San Andreas</LOCATION> at this point. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists do not yet understand whether the quakes on the Calaveras fault may 
have been a precursor, or somehow added pressure, on the <LOCATION>San Andreas</LOCATION>. But when 
a 5.1 earthquake did strike on the Calaveras in <DATE>1988</DATE>, some earthquake 
scientists expressed concern that this could be the case. 
</P>
<P>
Between the late <DATE>1950s</DATE> and <DATE>1979</DATE>, there were no quakes of magnitude 5 or larger 
near the <LOCATION>Bay Area</LOCATION>. But in <DATE>August, 1979</DATE>, a 6.4-magnitude quake struck under 
<ORGANIZATION>Coyote Lake</ORGANIZATION> east of <LOCATION>Gilroy</LOCATION> and south of <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION>, and since then there have 
been a number of quakes. 
</P>
<P>
In <DATE>August</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Geological Survey</ORGANIZATION> scientists had expressed concern at the step-up in 
5-magnitude quakes south of the <LOCATION>Bay Area</LOCATION>. They noted that a similar series of 
moderately strong quakes had preceded the <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> quake of <DATE>1906</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a <LOCATION>New Mexico</LOCATION> scientist who studies tidal forces, supported by two 
eyewitnesses, said <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> that at a private lecture in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> on 
<DATE>Oct. 10</DATE>, he had stated that a strong quake in the vicinity was probable on or 
about <DATE>Oct. 16</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Iben Browning</PERSON>, of <LOCATION>Sandia Park</LOCATION>, <PERSON>N. M.</PERSON>, said he had based his prediction on an 
assessment of tidal forces caused by the moon's relationship with the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. He 
said he had decided to keep the assessment private because he feared that 
publicity about it would cause people to panic.

<TEXT>
   By smell and sound, dogs and technicians
searched <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> for the last possible survivors of the killer
Bay Quake, and Californians by the thousands picked their way
through glass-strewn streets in search of a semblance of normal
life.
   Across <LOCATION>San Francisco Bay</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION>, hopes faded for finding
anyone alive within the tons of steel and concrete left when
<DATE>Tuesday</DATE>'s earthquake brought one level of Interstate 880 down atop
another.
   More than 250 people were feared entombed in that twisted
wreckage, and at least 18 others were dead elsewhere in the quake
area. Some 650 people were injured, said state emergency services
spokesman <PERSON>John Peterson</PERSON>.
   ``To the best of our knowledge now, there are not any people
still alive on this freeway,'' said <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON>Lionel Wilson</PERSON>
said of the collapsed roadway.
   Searchers had been hindered by darkness and the condition of the
wrecked freeway, which <ORGANIZATION>Acting Oakland City</ORGANIZATION> Manager <PERSON>Craig Kocian</PERSON>
described as ``a house of cards'' that could collapse further at
any time unless rescuers work carefully.
   The 1\ miles of the Nimitz Freeway that collapsed was one of
oldest in the area, built in <DATE>1950s</DATE>, and apparently was not included
in a program to make spans earthquake-proof, said state
<ORGANIZATION>Transportation Department</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>Kyle Nelson</PERSON>.
   In just 15 seconds, the earthquake destroyed or damaged hundreds
of buildings along 100 miles of the <LOCATION>San Andreas Fault</LOCATION>, collapsed a
section of the <LOCATION>San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge</LOCATION> and two spans near
<LOCATION>Santa Cruz</LOCATION>, cracked roads, and severed gas and power lines,
sparking fires.
   The temblor, the nation's second-deadliest, surpassed only by
the <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> earthquake of <DATE>1906</DATE>, measured 6.9 on the Richter
scale and was felt 350 miles away.
   Even as residents and officials tried to evaluate the damage,
President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> signed a disaster declaration making federal funds
available for recovery, and said ``we will take every step and make
every effort'' to help.
   The president said he probably would fly to the area for a
personal inspection but left open when that might happen. Vice
President <PERSON>Dan Quayle</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Transportation</ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON>Samuel Skinner</PERSON>
toured the quake-ravaged area by helicopter <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
   The federal government normally pays at least <PERCENT>75 percent</PERCENT> of the
cost of rebuilding bridges and public facilities that are
destroyed, and provides low-cost loans. The order covered seven
counties.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Federal Emergency Management Agency</ORGANIZATION> set up a center in
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> and was trying to determine whether the relief order
should be expanded.
   Lt. Gov. <PERSON>Leo McCarthy</PERSON> said damage was ``the better part of <MONEY>$1
billion</MONEY>.'' Other estimates were in the billions in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>
alone.
   Gov. <PERSON>George Deukmejian</PERSON> headed home from a trade mission to <LOCATION>West
Germany</LOCATION>.
   In <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Marina District</ORGANIZATION>, where a fire fueled by gas
destroyed a block of 12 apartment buildings, about 500 people
packed a cafeteria at <ORGANIZATION>Marina Middle School</ORGANIZATION> for breakfast after
spending the night on cots and mats.
   Deputy Fire Chief <PERSON>Mike K. Farrell</PERSON> said he strongly suspected
people were trapped in collapsed buildings. ``We're going to bring
in dogs to see if people are trapped in there. I saw three- and
four-story buildings that are now one-story buildings.''
   <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> donated sonic equipment to help detect any sounds of
people trapped alive in rubble, said <PERSON>Scott Shafer</PERSON>, a spokesman for
Mayor Art Agnos. Nine people are known dead and ``I expect we'll
find more bodies,'' he said.
   State <PERSON>Sen. Milton Marks</PERSON> of <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> estimated damage in the
<LOCATION>Marina</LOCATION> area alone at <MONEY>$1 billion</MONEY>. <PERSON>Shafer</PERSON> said damage throughout the
city would run into the billions.
   The transportation system was crippled by the closing of the <LOCATION>San
Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge</LOCATION>, and Agnos urged commuters to stay
home <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
   Tourist ferries that helped <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> by giving commuters free
rides to <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION> charged the normal <MONEY>$4</MONEY> on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>. The <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION>
and <LOCATION>San Francisco International</LOCATION> airports reopened and <ORGANIZATION>BART</ORGANIZATION>, the
rapid transit system, was open.
   <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> Rose, one of about 400 people who spent the night at an
emergency <ORGANIZATION>Red Cross</ORGANIZATION> center, said, ``I have antiques, silver and
nice things. But when you really get down to it _ and I never
thought I'd feel this way _ these things don't matter. The material
things do not make life.''
   About 50 volunteers worked at the shelter and more walked in to
offer their services <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME>. ``People have been
wonderful. We had an incredible community response,'' said <PERSON>Marian
Richie</PERSON>, a volunteer <ORGANIZATION>Red Cross</ORGANIZATION> nurse.
   Students from the <ORGANIZATION>University of San Francisco</ORGANIZATION> visited the
shelter <DATE>Tuesday night</DATE> to ask what was needed, went back to campus
and returned with food, cots and blankets, <PERSON>Richie</PERSON> said. ``It's an
absolute grass-roots response. I've never seen anything like it.
People come up and say, `How can I help?'''
   It looked like a <DATE>Sunday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME> in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>'s financial
district, with little visible damage, though many buildings were
closed. A sign on the <ORGANIZATION>International Building</ORGANIZATION> on <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> Street _
the equivalent of <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>'s Wall Street _ said, ``Building closed!
No power. No exceptions!''
   More than 1 million people lost electricity, including the
financial district office of <ORGANIZATION>Merrill Lynch</ORGANIZATION>, where operations
manager <PERSON>Joe Centis</PERSON> said he arrived at <TIME>5:30 a.m.</TIME> and found wire room
operator <PERSON>Tom Begley</PERSON> using a power-safe phone to call in orders that
came in <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> after the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> market closed.
   Officials said power in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> would be restored
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
   In <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION>, people picked their way to work through broken glass
and broken buildings <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>. Employees of <ORGANIZATION>American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph</ORGANIZATION>, like others, waited outside their office while engineers
inspected it.
   ``If they let us in, we'll be lucky,'' said <PERSON>Judy Colwell</PERSON>, who
suffered a bone bruise on her arm during the quake. Water from a
broken main still dripped from light fixtures on a third floor
overhang of the building's facade.
   Ironworkers at a high-rise under construction near I-880 were on
standby to help untangle the wreckage of the highway. The
building's temporary floors were askew and the workers' elevator
had fallen and lay embedded in the pavement.
   ``We put it up, so we're going to have to go up and straighten
it up,'' <PERSON>Jim Osburn</PERSON> said of the building. ``It's always more
dangerous to take it down than it is to take it up, but somebody
will have to go up there and make it safe.''
   While some people arrived for work, others were finishing a long
night.
   ``I've been out here since 7 o'clock,'' said <PERSON>Randy Rogers</PERSON>, one
of three men shoveling fist-sized chunks of fallen masonry into a
pickup truck.
   Red Cross volunteers began house-hunting for evacuees who spent
the night in cafeterias and gymnasiums. ``Hopefully we'll have them
all out in a couple of days,'' said <PERSON>Tekoa King</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Red Cross</ORGANIZATION> nurse.

   A strong earthquake shook the <LOCATION>San
Francisco Peninsula</LOCATION> on <DATE>Monday</DATE>, but there were no immediate reports
of injury or serious damage.
   ``I went outside and watched the windows rattle,'' said <PERSON>Marcey
Beaupre</PERSON>, manager of the <ORGANIZATION>Super Yarn Mart</ORGANIZATION> in nearby <LOCATION>Santa Clara</LOCATION>. ``I
got 20 windows and all they did was rattle. Nothing happened.''
   The <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Geological Survey</ORGANIZATION> set a preliminary magnitude of 5.0 on
the Richter scale for the temblor, while the <ORGANIZATION>University of
California</ORGANIZATION>'s seismographic stations at <LOCATION>Berkeley</LOCATION> rated it at 4.4.
   A 5.0 quake is considered powerful enough to cause considerable
damage in populated areas.
   Witnesses reported a rolling quake lasting 15 to 20 seconds. It
was felt in most of the <LOCATION>San Francisco Bay</LOCATION> area, including as far
north at <LOCATION>Petaluma</LOCATION> and in the region south and east of <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION>.
   <ORGANIZATION>USGS</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON>Pat Jorgenson</PERSON> said the quake struck at <TIME>10:46
a.m.</TIME> on the <LOCATION>Calaveras Fault</LOCATION> and was centered eight miles east of
<LOCATION>Milpitas</LOCATION>, about 50 miles southeast of <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>.
   ``We don't have any reports of major damage,'' said <PERSON>Vince
Montane</PERSON>, regional manager of the <ORGANIZATION>state Office of Emergency
Services</ORGANIZATION>. ``The cities and counties have called in with a few
instances of broken glass and plates falling off shelves and
pictures off the walls and that kind of thing.''
   A 100-square-foot pane of glass shattered in the control tower
at <LOCATION>Reid-Hillview Airport</LOCATION>, showering glass into the parking lot
three stories below. No injuries were reported.
   There were reports of telephone outages, but <ORGANIZATION>Pacific Bell</ORGANIZATION>
officials blamed it on overloaded circuits.
   <DATE>April 18</DATE> is the anniversary of the great <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>
earthquake of <DATE>1906</DATE>, which triggered fires which destroyed most of
the city.
   The open-ended Richter scale is a measure of the energy released
by an earthquake, as measured by ground motion recorded on a
seisomograph.
   Each increase of one number, as in a jump from magnitude 5.5 to
6.5, means that the ground motion is 10 times greater. A quake of
3.5 can cause slight damage in populated areas, while a quake of
6.0 can cause severe damage. In <DATE>March 1964</DATE> an earthquake in <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION>
hit 8.5 on the Richter scale, killing 114 people.

   <LOCATION>San Francisco Bay</LOCATION> area residents were
jolted awake <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> by a sharp earthquake that broke windows,
toppled groceries and startled a man into falling to his death from
a fifth-story apartment window.
   The quake occurred as state and federal emergency services
officials prepared to conduct a two-day test of their response to a
catastrophic earthquake.
   The quake, which hit with a jolt and rolled for 10 seconds,
caused only minor structural damage, but was felt as far away as
San <PERSON>Luis Obispo</PERSON>, about 230 miles south of <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> and in
<LOCATION>Sonoma County</LOCATION>, 60 miles to the north.
   The temblor struck at <TIME>1:13 a.m.</TIME> and measured 5.2 on the Richter
scale of ground motion. It was centered on the <LOCATION>San Andreas</LOCATION> fault
about 15 miles south of <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION>.
   A moderate aftershock measuring 4.2 on the Richter scale struck
at <TIME>1:44 a.m.</TIME>, followed by a second, stronger aftershock that
measured 4.5 at <TIME>8:53 a.m.</TIME>, according to the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Geological Survey</ORGANIZATION>
in <LOCATION>Menlo Park</LOCATION>.
   ``I thought all my windows were going to break,'' said <PERSON>Margaret
Dunlap</PERSON> of <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>. ``My whole bed was shaking.''
   In <LOCATION>Los Gatos</LOCATION>, where the quake was centered, police reported that
<PERSON>Matthew James Bignall</PERSON>, 19, accidentally jumped from his bedroom
window after apparently being startled awake by the earthquake.
   <PERSON>Bignall</PERSON> died of multiple injuries, according to a spokeswoman
with the <LOCATION>Santa Clara County</LOCATION> coroner's office.
   Residents reported some broken windows and items falling off
shelves but no major problems, a <LOCATION>Los Gatos</LOCATION> police dispatcher said.
Damage was confined mostly to <LOCATION>Santa Clara</LOCATION> and northern <LOCATION>Santa Cruz</LOCATION>
counties, according to the <ORGANIZATION>state Office of Emergency Services</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Sacramento</LOCATION>.
   Experts warned that the seismic activity signals an increased
chance that a severe earthquake will strike the area during the
next week.
   ``It certainly shows us the fault is becoming more active,''
said <PERSON>Andy Michael</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>USGS</ORGANIZATION> geophysicist, who said the quake was the
largest in the area since <DATE>1969</DATE>.
   ``The stress is building up in the earth and we're going to
start getting large earthquakes,'' said <PERSON>Michael</PERSON>. ``It should serve
as a reminder to prepare.''
   <PERSON>Dave Shea</PERSON>, 21, spent more than an hour cleaning up the paint
store he manages in <LOCATION>Los Gatos</LOCATION>, where about 20 cans fell off shelves
and four quarts of paint splattered on the floor.
   ``It made a nice little splotch mess,'' he said, estimating
damage at about <MONEY>$300</MONEY>.
   The false ceiling in a vacant <LOCATION>Los Gatos</LOCATION> business came down, and
about half a dozen businesses reported broken windows, police said.
One of the front windows of a grocery store blew out, according
<PERSON>Sharon Sieker</PERSON>, an assistant manager at the <ORGANIZATION>Safeway</ORGANIZATION>. She said she
found ``red wine all over the floor'' when she arrived about 2 <ORGANIZATION>a.m.
   Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Pacific Bell</ORGANIZATION> reported no major
problems as a result of the quake.
   The earthquake drill involved a mock temblor in the <LOCATION>Bay</LOCATION> area in
which 5,000 people die.
   <PERSON>Marilyn Quayle</PERSON>, wife of Vice President <PERSON>Dan Quayle</PERSON>, was in
<LOCATION>Sacramento</LOCATION> to attend the first day of the test. When she woke up at
<TIME>5:30 a.m.</TIME> and saw coverage of the actual earthquake on television,
she thought it was part of the exercise.
   ``I thought, `Gee, this is pretty interesting. They have the
(earthquake) simulation on television already,''' <PERSON>Mrs. Quayle</PERSON> said.
   The open-ended Richter scale is a measure of the energy released
by an earthquake, as measured by ground motion recorded on a
seisomograph.
   <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>'s Great Quake, which occurred in <DATE>1906</DATE> before the
Richter scale was devised, has been estimated at 8.3. Recent
estimates say more than 2,000 people died in the quake and the fire
it touched off, which burned much of the city.
   Each increase of one number, as in a jump from magnitude 5.5 to
6.5, means that the ground motion is 10 times greater. A quake of
3.5 can cause slight damage in populated areas, while a quake of
6.0 can cause severe damage. In <DATE>March 1964</DATE> an earthquake in <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION>
hit 8.5 on the Richter scale, killing 114 people.

   Freeway survivor Buck Helm improved <DATE>Monday</DATE>
but crews searching the collapsed highway where he was rescued gave
up hope others would be found alive. The death toll from last
week's earthquake climbed by three to 62.
   Bay area commuters, after conquering heavy morning traffic and
rough seas on the first full workday since the quake, faced few
afternoon traffic tangles. In <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>, relief legislation worth
<MONEY>$2.85 billion</MONEY> moved toward a vote <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
   ``We're very certain nobody's up there alive. We've searched,
searched, researched, triple-searched,'' said <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION> police Lt.
<PERSON>Kris Wraa</PERSON>, referring to the crumpled 1\-mile stretch of Interstate
880 where huge slabs of concrete teetered in the rain.
   Asked if officials had given up hope of finding another
survivor, she said, ``That's fair wording.''
   With rescue efforts suspended, crews began dismantling a shaky
100-yard section, officials said.
   <PERSON>Kyle Nelson</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>California Department of Transportation</ORGANIZATION>,
whose job is to make the structure was safe for rescuers, called it
extremely dangerous. ``Given the right conditions of rain and wind,
it could have collapsed,'' he said.
   Near the freeway, authorities <DATE>Monday</DATE> evacuated additional homes
after ordering 150 residents of a housing project to leave <DATE>Sunday</DATE>
because of fears that more of the highway could fall. Thousands
have been left homeless by the quake.
   ``We were all scared,'' said <PERSON>Charles Burns</PERSON>, who carried a Bible
and other books to a middle school where evacuees were being
sheltered.
   There was good news, however, for Helm. He was no longer in
pain, his kidney function continued to improve and his condition
was upgraded from critical to very serious, <PERSON>Dr. Floyd Huen</PERSON> said.
   ``We hope that as soon as tomorrow, he will be down to
serious,'' <PERSON>Huen</PERSON> said.
   The 57-year-old longshoreman, who spent four days trapped under
the freeway rubble in his <ORGANIZATION>Chevrolet Sprint</ORGANIZATION> before being rescued
<DATE>Saturday</DATE>, was awake and was given a writing tablet and pencil so he
could start responding to questions while on a respirator.
   His former wife, <PERSON>Lorrie Helm</PERSON>, has read him news accounts of his
ordeal and he seems to understand, she said.
   ``His love for us and our love for him is one of the major
things that kept him going,'' <PERSON>Mrs. Helm</PERSON> said at a news conference
with other family members.
   ``He's always been there when I needed him, and this is when he
needs us.''
   Since their parting, the two have remained good friends, she
said. ``We've been divorced for four years and he never gave up. I
would say that's a positive attitude.''
   Later, stopping at the collapsed freeway, <PERSON>Mrs. Helm</PERSON> exclaimed,
``Oh my God. I don't see how anyone could make it out alive,''
according to <ORGANIZATION>Oakland Police</ORGANIZATION> Sgt. <PERSON>Jack Huth</PERSON>.
   ``And then she reflected on it a minute and said, `Well, if
anyone could, Buck could.'''
   Commuters returned to the earthquake-ravaged transit system
<DATE>Monday</DATE>, many boarding extra trains or a flotilla of ferries because
the Bay Bridge from <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> remained closed.
   The Bay Area Rapid Transit system carried twice the normal load
and ferry passengers had to stomach rough seas and whipping winds.
   ``I've just been through hell, but heck, I have to admit I made
it through it,'' said <PERSON>John Trowbridge</PERSON>, a commuter who normally
would have driven across the Bay Bridge but instead rode a ferry
that lurched constantly, battling swells that washed across the tip
of the boat.
   ``It can only get better, this can't get much worse,'' he said.
   In clear weather during the evening rush hour, few traffic
bottlenecks were reported.
   Damage from <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>'s 6.9-magnitude quake topped <MONEY>$7 billion</MONEY>,
surpassing Hurricane Hugo as the costliest natural disaster in <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
history, according to the <ORGANIZATION>Independent Insurance Agents of America</ORGANIZATION>.
   In <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> alone, 750 to 1,000 buildings need extensive
repair, Mayor Art Agnos told the city-county <ORGANIZATION>Board of Supervisors</ORGANIZATION>
<DATE>Monday</DATE>. He estimated damage in the city at <MONEY>$2.2 billion</MONEY> to <MONEY>$3.2
billion</MONEY>.
   Gov. <PERSON>George Deukmejian</PERSON> announced he would call a special
legislative session within two weeks to work out the state's
response to the devastation.
   Also <DATE>Monday</DATE>, the governor fired <PERSON>Ian Buckle</PERSON>, the earthquake
expert hired to probe the the I-880 collapse, saying his defense of
the state transportation department in an op-ed article jeopardized
the inquiry's impartiality.
   Two more deaths were reported in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, and in the beach
town of <LOCATION>Bonny Doon</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, north of <LOCATION>Santa Cruz</LOCATION>, workers uncovered
the body of 41-year-old man, identified as <PERSON>Gary Phillip West</PERSON>,
buried by a landslide during the quake. His car had been found
<DATE>Sunday</DATE>.
   One <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> victim, an unidentified woman, was found in
fire rubble in the <LOCATION>Marina</LOCATION> district. The other, a 68-year-old woman
from <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION>, died of injuries sustained at a downtown hotel.
   So far, 38 bodies have been pulled from I-880. Dozens remained
missing and authorities said they are sure some remain entombed in
the freeway. Thousands were injured and homeless from the quake.
   At a <ORGANIZATION>Salvation Army</ORGANIZATION> warehouse filled to the rafters with donated
supplies, a dozen volunteers <DATE>Monday</DATE> prepared goods to be sent to
quake victims.
   Donors continued to bring plastic bags full of clothes, sleeping
bags and food to the warehouse, which held items ranging from
seltzer water to canned soup.
   ``People are just very generous,'' said <PERSON>Gordon Helms</PERSON> of the
<ORGANIZATION>Salvation Army</ORGANIZATION>. ``They're very concerned about the needs of other
people.''
   A <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> committee approved a <MONEY>$2.85 billion</MONEY> quake aid package,
and the full <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> is expected to act <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>. The package is more
than the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> supported, but more than <MONEY>$1 billion</MONEY> under the
request from the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> congressional delegation.
   Presidential press secretary <PERSON>Marlin Fitzwater</PERSON> said the aid could
be extended without an increase in the gasoline tax or other new
federal taxes. Congressional sources said lawmakers were putting
off determining how to pay for the package.
   ``There is an urgent need for help for people now,'' <PERSON>Sen. Pete
Wilson</PERSON>, <LOCATION>R-Calif.</LOCATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION>Senate Environment and Public Works</ORGANIZATION>
subcommittee on transporation and Resources.
   Yet for many in the Bay area, a scenic and diverse region of 6
million, life was actually quite normal throughout the past week.
Damage was confined to distinct areas of the major cities, although
destruction was widespread through <LOCATION>Santa Cruz County</LOCATION> towns.
   And <DATE>Monday</DATE>'s commute, slow but not paralyzing, underscored how
well <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> has coped.
   <PERSON>Dr. Beverly Bradley</PERSON>, supervisor of health programs for the <ORGANIZATION>San
Francisco United School District</ORGANIZATION>, said she was in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> when the
quake hit and got mistaken first impressions that the entire city
crumpled.
   ``From watching TV, I got the impression the city was in
shambles. In truth, most of the city is functioning very well and
back to normal.
   ``I keep telling my relatives around the country the city is
fine except for some very specific areas that did suffer,'' she
said.
   The first phase of the Bay Bridge repair started when workers
sawed a 50-foot collapsed section in half and lowered both halves
200 feet by crane <DATE>Sunday</DATE> to a barge on wind-whipped <LOCATION>San Francisco
Bay</LOCATION>.
   Without the Bay Bridge, 65,000 rush-hour motorists were forced
to seek other ways to work. Daily, 260,000 cars use the bridge, the
most crucial of the region's earthquake-disrupted roadways. Repairs
will take at least four weeks.
   About 3 million people commute on a typical workday in the
nine-county region. Authorities warned that <MONEY>2 million</MONEY> of them could
be disrupted in a nightmarish obstacle course.
   Besides I-880 in <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION>, other freeways were also devastated.
The <ORGANIZATION>Embarcadero Freeway</ORGANIZATION> and the I-280 extension are closed in <LOCATION>San
Francisco</LOCATION>. Farther south, landslide-clogged Highway 17 is open only
to buses and emergency vehicles.

<HEAD>Quake-Hit SF Bay Area Commuters Hunt New Ways To Work</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Like storm-tossed captains plotting a
course around rocks and shoals, a million <LOCATION>San Francisco Bay</LOCATION> area
workers _ their normal commute routes ruined by an earthquake _ are
devising new strategies for getting to and from work.
   ``I really don't see how there cannot be gridlock on <DATE>Monday</DATE>,''
said a harried <PERSON>Tom Silvey</PERSON>, a state <ORGANIZATION>Franchise Tax Board</ORGANIZATION> worker now
assigned to the <ORGANIZATION>state Office of Emergency Services</ORGANIZATION>.
   <DATE>Monday</DATE> is considered the region's transportation equivalent of
D-day along 70 miles from <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Santa Cruz</LOCATION>. It includes
a plan for using <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> landing craft to ferry commuters between
<LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, where four freeways and high-speed
connectors are closed.
   For much of the work force, commute times are expected to
stretch into an extra hour or more each way.
   The Bay Area Rapid Transit, the railroad that travels under <LOCATION>San
Francisco Bay</LOCATION> to connect the city with <LOCATION>East Bay</LOCATION> communities, is
running extra cars and expanding to 24-hour operation. Daily BART
business is expected to double to at least 300,000 person-trips.
   Morning comute tolls have been eliminated on all transbay
bridges except the Golden Gate, where commuters will be excused
from tolls on <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>mornings</TIME> only.
   By far the most serious disruption is to the traffic _ 243,000
vehicles each working day _ normally carried by the key
eight-mile-long <LOCATION>San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge</LOCATION>. It a major <LOCATION>San
Francisco</LOCATION> lifeline for food, industrial and other goods, vehicular
traffic from the east, and some half-million people a day.
   <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>'s quake dumped a 50-foot section of the bridge's top
deck onto the bottom deck of the 52-year-old span, and engineers
estimated repairs might take as long as two months.
   A driver who normally takes the Bay Bridge from <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> to
<LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION> must now either go 20 miles south and then cross the bay on
the <LOCATION>San Mateo Bridge</LOCATION>, or take the Golden Gate Bridge and drive 18
miles north in <LOCATION>Marin County</LOCATION> to cross the bay on the <ORGANIZATION>Richmond-San
Rafael Bridge</ORGANIZATION>. The southern route costs an extra 60 miles, the
northern detour an additional 40 miles.
   In <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION>, the upper deck of a 1\-mile portion of Interstate
880 collapsed onto the lower deck in a deadly vise of concrete and
steel. The roadway, a conduit to and from the <LOCATION>Bay Bridge</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>East
Oakland</LOCATION>, bay-side cities and points south, will be out of
commission for at least two years.
   In <LOCATION>Santa Cruz</LOCATION>, 70 miles south of <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, the 20,000
people who cross the <LOCATION>Santa Cruz Mountains</LOCATION> daily on State Highway 17
to work in <LOCATION>Silicon Valley</LOCATION> must seek alternate routes because
landslides have closed that route.
   The recommended alternates from <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Santa Cruz</LOCATION>: South on
101 to Highway 152 west, then north to Highway 1 _ 40 miles extra;
or, west from <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION> on Highway 9 _ 20 miles extra.
   <ORGANIZATION>Greyhound Lines Inc.</ORGANIZATION> announced <DATE>Friday</DATE> it had suspended bus
service to <LOCATION>Santa Cruz</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Watsonville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Los Gatos</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Cupertino</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Saratoga</LOCATION> because of the closure of Highway 17.
   In <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, central-city motorists used to zipping down
the hills to the <PERSON>Gough</PERSON> and Oak street connectors to Highway 101
found the on-ramps closed because of structural damage to roadway
underpinnings. They must now travel city streets for a mile or so
to find southbound on-ramps.
   In addition, the city's <ORGANIZATION>Embarcadero Freeway</ORGANIZATION>, which runs on the
edge of the bay, is closed because of structural failure. And the
I-280 extension from downtown <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> to 101 near <LOCATION>Candlestick
Park</LOCATION> sustained structural failure and will be closed for several
months.
   Those are the only two other double-deck freeways in <LOCATION>Northern
California</LOCATION> besides I-880.

<HEAD>State Says Risk Of Severe Quake Increases Slightly Near S.F. Bay
Area</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A slightly increased risk of a severe
earthquake exists in an area south of <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> that was jolted
by a moderate temblor this week, say state officials who also
caution against public alarm.
   <ORGANIZATION>California's Office of Emergency Services</ORGANIZATION> issued an advisory
<DATE>Tuesday</DATE> saying that for the next five days, the slightly increased
likelihood for continued seismic activity was possible for the
region rocked by <DATE>Monday</DATE>'s earthquake, which scientists estimated at
between 5.0 and 5.7 on the Richter scale.
   Scientists from the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Geological Survey</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>University of
California</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Berkeley</LOCATION>, and the state <ORGANIZATION>Division of Mines</ORGANIZATION> and Geology
``say that this activity could involve an earthquake as large as
6.5 Richter magnitude, although it's not probable that a quake of
this size will occur,'' the advisory said.
   It was issued to alert officials of <LOCATION>Santa Cruz</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>San Benito</LOCATION>,
<ORGANIZATION>Monterey</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Santa Clara</LOCATION> counties ``to maintain preparedness and
awareness measures.''
   The chance of a magnitude-6.5 quake on the <LOCATION>San Andreas Fault</LOCATION>
within five days ``is a very slight possibility, but we do feel it
is our responsibility to make this information public,'' Office of
<ORGANIZATION>Emergency Services</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>Tom Mullins</PERSON> said from <LOCATION>Sacramento</LOCATION>.
   ``There is some some concern, although no alarm,'' said <PERSON>Mike
Guerin</PERSON>, a spokesman at the agency's office in <LOCATION>Ontario</LOCATION>.
   Damage from a 6.5-magnitude quake could be comparable to that
caused by the 6.2-magnitude <ORGANIZATION>Morgan Hill</ORGANIZATION> quake on <DATE>April 24, 1984</DATE>,
acting state geologist <PERSON>Brian Tucker</PERSON> said. That quake injured 27
people and caused <MONEY>$10 million</MONEY> in damage.
   Residents of <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>San Francisco Bay</LOCATION> area could
expect a 6.5-magnitude quake to cause ``swaying of high-rise
buildings, potentially some fires and some localized areas of more
intense damage'' to buildings, <PERSON>Tucker</PERSON> said.
   <PERSON>Guerin</PERSON> said the advisory, which isn't a prediction, was issued
because scientists believe additional stress has been placed on a
portion of the <LOCATION>San Andreas Fault</LOCATION> by <DATE>Monday</DATE>'s quake, which swayed
skyscrapers in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> but resulted in no reports of injuries
or serious damage.
   <DATE>Monday</DATE>'s quake was centered on the <LOCATION>San Andreas</LOCATION> Fault 16 miles
south of <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION>, officials said.
   <PERSON>Tucker</PERSON> said scientists believe <DATE>Monday</DATE>'s quake added stress to
the <LOCATION>San Andreas</LOCATION> in part because the section of the fault that
snapped had been relatively quiet for years and the temblor
occurred near the junction of the <LOCATION>San Andreas</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Sargent</PERSON> faults.
Quakes are more likely to start near fault junctions, he said.
   Quake predictions or advisories have been rare in the <LOCATION>United
States</LOCATION>.
   In <DATE>April 1985</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>USGS</ORGANIZATION> predicted that by <DATE>Janauary 1993</DATE>, an
earthquake measuring about 6 on the Richter scale is highly likely
to hit the <LOCATION>Parkfield</LOCATION> segment of the <LOCATION>San Andreas</LOCATION>, a sparsely
populated section about 130 miles southeast of the section that
ruptured <DATE>Monday</DATE>. The prediction remains in effect.
   In <DATE>June 1985</DATE>, a series of magnitude 2.5 to 4.2 quakes near <LOCATION>San
Diego</LOCATION> spurred the <ORGANIZATION>USGS</ORGANIZATION> to advise there was a <PERCENT>5 percent</PERCENT> chance of a
magnitude 5.0 quake within five days. None occurred.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude.
   An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight
damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage,
6 severe damage. A 7 reading is a ``major'' earthquake, capable of
widespread heavy damage; 8 is a ``great'' quake, capable of
tremendous damage.
   The <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> earthquake of <DATE>1906</DATE>, which occurred before the
Richter scale was devised, has been estimated at 8.3 on the Richter
scale.

   Only nine people remained unaccounted for
<DATE>Tuesday</DATE> _ one week after <LOCATION>Northern California</LOCATION>'s ravaging earthquake
_ and geologists predicted a 50-50 chance by Christmas of a major
aftershock capable of causing considerable damage.
   The <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Geological Survey</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> also revised upward the
magnitude of the <DATE>Oct. 17</DATE> quake, from 6.9 to 7.1 on the Richter
scale.
   Church bells tolled at <TIME>5:04 p.m.</TIME>, one week to the minute after
the quake. And <TIME>83 minutes later</TIME>, at <TIME>6:27 p.m.</TIME>, the strongest
aftershock in four days, with a Richter scale reading of 4.5,
rattled the area. There were no immediate reports of damage.
   A <MONEY>$2.85 billion</MONEY> quake aid bill passed the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. House</ORGANIZATION>.
   Survivor Buck Helm's condition improved to serious with his
kidney function reported normal.
   Demolition crews were taking down sections of Interstate 880 in
<LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION> for fear still-standing sections of the elevated,
double-deck structure could tumble like dominoes onto the 1\-mile
stretch that collapsed in the <DATE>Oct. 17</DATE> quake.
   The death toll rose to 63 with a coroner's discovery of a 39th
victim among the remains dug out of the rubble of I-880, which was
thefirst elevated freeway built in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>.
   But authorities have been able to account for all but nine of
the 280 reported missing during the last week, <ORGANIZATION>California Highway
Patrol</ORGANIZATION> Lt. <PERSON>Kris Wraa</PERSON> said.
   ``I'm not willing to speculate how many of those nine missing
people may or may not be up there,'' <PERSON>Wraa</PERSON> said, referring to the
collapsed freeway.
   Rescue crews have not been able to locate other bodies in the
rubble, where 55 cars were trapped at rush-hour _ a number
considered well below a normal <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, possibly because of the
scheduled third game of the World Series between the Bay area's two
major league baseball teams.
   A traffic officer reported he was ``surprised at how light
traffic was'' five minutes before the quake, <ORGANIZATION>California Highway
Patrol</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>Thomas A. Noble</PERSON> said.
   Four sections remain inaccessible to searchers. Digging was to
resume when the threatening sections were taken down, possibly by
<DATE>Thursday</DATE>. There was no hope of finding anyone alive, authorities
said.
   ``The people that are (unaccounted for), I believe are
responsible people. Many of their cars have been found on that
interchange and for whatever reason their loved ones have not had
contact with them,'' <ORGANIZATION>Oakland Police</ORGANIZATION> Sgt. <PERSON>Greg Hughes</PERSON> said.
   ``We've sent officers out to check their homes, check their
jobs, and every four hours we're talking to the families,'' he said.
   Seismologists at the geological survey said they revised the
quake's Richter reading to 7.1 after checking data from 18 seismic
stations around the world.
   ``The original magnitude of 6.9 was based on more localized
seismic readings,'' said <PERSON>Waverly Person</PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION>USGS
National Earthquake Information Service</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Golden</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Colo.</LOCATION>, in a
statement.
   The <ORGANIZATION>USGS</ORGANIZATION> issued a long-range aftershock forecast predicting over
the <DATE>next two months</DATE> an <PERCENT>11 percent</PERCENT> chance of a temblor of magnitude
6.0 or larger, and a <PERCENT>50 percent</PERCENT> chance of one registering 5.0 or
larger.
   On the Richter scale of earthquake magnitude, 5.0 is considered
capable of considerable damage, and 6.0 capable of severe damage.
State emergency coordinators have said that an aftershock of 5.0
could be especially troublesome to buildings already damaged or
weakened by the initial earthquake.
   The probabilities were based on statistics for <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>
earthquakes, and not on actual measurements at the <LOCATION>San Andreas
Fault</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>USGS</ORGANIZATION> geophysicist <PERSON>Jim Luetgert</PERSON> said.
   More than 3,500 aftershocks, some almost imperceptible, had been
detected by <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME>, the <ORGANIZATION>USGS</ORGANIZATION> said.
   The strong aftershock <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> <TIME>evening</TIME> was centered 14 miles
northeast of <LOCATION>Santa Cruz</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>USGS</ORGANIZATION> said. The aftershock was the
largest since the 4.6 aftershock that occurred about <TIME>9:15 p.m.</TIME>
<DATE>Saturday</DATE>, said <PERSON>Pat Jorgenson</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>USGS</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``It felt pretty sharp and fairly long, but I guess it lasted
only seven to 10 seconds,'' said <PERSON>Santa Cruz</PERSON> police dispatcher <PERSON>Chuck
Minuti</PERSON>. ``We had a few phone calls right away but no reports of
damage.''
   Engineers reported <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> that the toppled 50-foot section of
the Bay Bridge was unrepairable. Officials for the transportation
department said they hope to put up a new five-lane section on the
lifeline across <LOCATION>San Francisco Bay</LOCATION> by <DATE>Nov. 16</DATE>.
   Commuters, left without the bridge and several stretches of
freeway, fared well again <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, using public transit in record
numbers, transportation officials said.
   Gov. <PERSON>George Deukmejian</PERSON>, speaking to business leaders, praised
efforts to reduce traffic and warned against lapsing into regular
cummuting patterns. ``We've got some longterm concerns here,'' he
said.
   In <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> voted 321-99 to send <MONEY>$2.85 billion</MONEY> in
earthquake-relief funds to <LOCATION>Northern California</LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> was
expected to concur <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> and send the legislation to President
<PERSON>Bush</PERSON>.
   In a floor speech before the vote, Rep. <PERSON>Nancy Pelosi</PERSON>, who
represents <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>'s Marina district, pleaded for ``a chance
to rebuild.''
   She said, ``We were hit by 10 times the amount of explosive
power of World War II, including the atomic bomb.''
   <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> Mayor Art Agnos called on the federal government
to raise the maximum home rebuilding loan to <MONEY>$500,000</MONEY> from
<MONEY>$100,000</MONEY>, reflecting high housing costs in the region.
   ``One-hundred thousand dollars in <LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION> can make a big
difference. It doesn't here,'' <PERSON>Agnos</PERSON> said.
   In <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> alone, 750 to 1,000 buildings need extensive
repair, <PERSON>Agnos</PERSON> told the city-county <ORGANIZATION>Board of Supervisors</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Monday</DATE>.
He estimated damage in the city at <MONEY>$2.2 billion</MONEY> to <MONEY>$3.2 billion</MONEY>.
   <PERSON>Clyde Walthall</PERSON>, spokesman for <ORGANIZATION>Pacific Gas &amp; Electric</ORGANIZATION>, said the
utility estimates they'll need to replace about 10 miles of gas
distribution lines in the hard-hit <LOCATION>Marina</LOCATION> district, at an estimated
cost of <MONEY>$10 million</MONEY>.
   He did not know how long that work would take, and said the
utility was awaiting clearance from the city before beginning the
work.
   About 5,100 customers are without gas service in the district,
and that about 1,000 customers are also without electric service,
<PERSON>Walthall</PERSON> said.
   Fire officials reported five homes were evacuated on <DATE>Monday</DATE> and
<DATE>Tuesday</DATE> when heavy rains caused landslides in the <LOCATION>Santa Cruz</LOCATION>
mountain communities of Zayante and <LOCATION>Boulder Creek</LOCATION>. No injuries were
reported.
   Since the quake, as many as 90 homeowners around Zayante made
the ``common sense decision'' to leave their uninhabitable homes
without being ordered to evacuate, said <PERSON>Ken Boynton</PERSON>, district fire
chief. Some of the houses slid and leaned against trees, while
others were reduced to rubble.
   Already, damage from the quake _ estimated at more than <MONEY>$7
billion</MONEY> _ has surpassed Hurricane Hugo as the costliest disaster in
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> history.
   <PERSON>Deukmejian</PERSON> said he would call a special legislative session
within two weeks to work out the state's response to the
devastation.
   Documents on file at the state transportation department in
<LOCATION>Sacramento</LOCATION> show that I-880, opened in <DATE>July 1957</DATE> at a construction
cost of <MONEY>$10.2 million</MONEY>, was the first elevated freeway in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>.
   A nearly identical roadway built soon after, the <LOCATION>Embarcadero</LOCATION> in
<LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, probably will be closed until <DATE>June</DATE> due to earthquake
damage. Unlike its near-twin in <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION>, this structure will be
repaired rather than replaced.
   Along the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> coastline near <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, rocks continued
to fall of cliffs damaged by the earthquake, making the beaches
below unsafe, the <ORGANIZATION>USGS</ORGANIZATION> said.
   ``There are many cracks along the tops of coastal bluffs, and
some of these could collapse without warning,'' the agency said.
   About a half-dozen wineries in the <LOCATION>Santa Cruz</LOCATION> region reported a
jumble of 500-pound wine barrels that rolled off madly leaping
racks stacked to the ceiling. Some lost precious bottles from their
wine ``library,'' the collection all wineries have of every vintage
produced.

<HEAD>Death and Destruction _ But Also Some Things to Cheer About</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVE WILSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There is a sense of triumph amid the death
and destruction of the earthquake that struck <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>.
   Skyscrapers shook but didn't fall. Trains stopped but most were
running again within hours. Businesses closed for a day to assess
damage, then reopened. The Bay Bridge was crippled, so thousands of
commuters switched to ferries.
   Police and fire officials maintained order. Hospitals stayed
open with auxiliary power. Radio and television kept up a critical
flow of information to the public.
   Perhaps most important, though, the vast majority of people
didn't panic. Instead, they comforted and helped each other, taking
in neighbors and strangers.
   The quake created heroes, from a surgeon who rescued a child
trapped on the collapsed Interstate 880 freeway to the thousands
who worked round the clock coping with the crisis.
   ``If this was a test of the <LOCATION>San Francisco Bay</LOCATION> area's ability to
respond to a major earthquake, we got an `A,''' says <PERSON>Steven Levy</PERSON>,
director of the <ORGANIZATION>Palo Alto-based Center for Continuing Study</ORGANIZATION> of the
<LOCATION>California Economy</LOCATION>.
   ``There are more than 6 million people in the <LOCATION>Bay</LOCATION> area and a
couple of hundred people died,'' <PERSON>Levy</PERSON> said <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, two days after
the quake. ``It's horrible for the families of victims and
traumatic for everyone, but it's not in the realm of a regional
economic disaster.''
   Certainly, there were failures and lessons to be learned.
   Commuters trapped in a Bay Area Rapid Transit train beneath the
bay when power went out complained they weren't given enough
information by <ORGANIZATION>BART</ORGANIZATION> officials about the quake.
   The <ORGANIZATION>San Francisco Fire Department</ORGANIZATION> said it was understaffed and
stretched to the limit in fighting blazes. Mayor Art <PERSON>Agnos</PERSON> said he
was ``ticked off'' that Vice President <PERSON>Dan Quayle</PERSON> failed to consult
with him during a tour of city.
   And questions continue about why I-880 crumbled and why a
section of the Bay Bridge fell like a trap door.
   Seen from a helicopter, though, <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION> remain
remarkably intact. The towers of steel, concrete and glass in both
cities stand tall in defiance of a jolt that sent shock waves 750
miles up and down the coast and eastward through the <LOCATION>Central Valley</LOCATION>
and <ORGANIZATION>Sierra Nevada</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``It speaks a lot for the design code of modern buildings and
the preparedness of <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> that there wasn't more damage,''
said <PERSON>George Lee</PERSON>, acting director of the <ORGANIZATION>National Center for
Earthquake Engineering Research</ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION>State University of New York</ORGANIZATION>
at <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION>.
   The skyscrapers were unharmed, <PERSON>Lee</PERSON> said, because they were
``overdesigned'' to prevent sway in upper levels and to resist
powerful wind gusts as much as earthquakes.
   ``I think we're going to learn a lot from this event,'' <PERSON>Lee</PERSON>
said. ``Many of the buildings have instruments that can determine
stresses and strains. We know the original designs of these
buildings and we know the ground motion and amplitude. Adding these
together will give us a very good picture where the weak links are
and that will improve designs for the future.''
   Most small buildings and homes throughout the <LOCATION>Bay</LOCATION> area also
survived with little or no damage, unlike those that crumbled in
<LOCATION>Soviet Armenia</LOCATION> when a similar 6.9 magnitude quake struck last
<DATE>December</DATE> and left 25,000 people dead and tens of thousands homeless.
   The economic toll of the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> quake is already estimated
at <MONEY>$4 billion</MONEY> and, according to <PERSON>Frank McCormick</PERSON>, a top economist
for the <ORGANIZATION>Bank of America</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, is likely to reach <MONEY>$10
billion</MONEY>. But that represents only about a month's worth of the <LOCATION>Bay</LOCATION>
area's <MONEY>$125 billion</MONEY> annual economy, he said, and will be offset
quickly by a boost to the economy from reconstruction jobs,
insurance payments and federal assistance.
   Within a day of the quake, trucks were moving in and out of the
<LOCATION>Port of Oakland</LOCATION>, which handles 1,700 vessels a month.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco</ORGANIZATION> continued to process
cash, checks and wire transfers ``without a glitch,'' according to
a spokesman. Most large banks used emergency generators to keep
their computers operating.
   <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION> international airports resumed
operations <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>. San Jose's was shut down for only three hours
<DATE>Tuesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>.
   The ultimate triumphs, though, were personal. <PERSON>Len Jann</PERSON>, a
station agent for <ORGANIZATION>BART</ORGANIZATION>, worked 18 hours day from <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME>
until <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME> to help people.
   ``We worked the whole night just to make sure people could get
back across the bay, and we stayed with them to make them feel they
weren't alone in this,'' he said.
   Among those he aided were three women _ one black, one white,
one Asian _ who were stuck in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>. Jann and his
co-workers watched over the women as they huddled together in the
BART station until <TIME>1 a.m.</TIME>, then drove them to the ferry and
arranged to have their husbands meet them in <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION>.
   ``Race, origin, what they did for a living, nothing mattered,''
he said. ``These three ladies banded together. That was typical of
how everybody acted. The whole Bay area banded together and
survived.''

<P>
It began with a rash of "heart attack calls" to the <ORGANIZATION>Oakland Police Department</ORGANIZATION>. 
Then people began arriving on foot at hospital emergency rooms throughout the 
<LOCATION>Bay Area</LOCATION>. Then came calls from cities and towns to state emergency services 
officials for fire engines and helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>National Guard</ORGANIZATION> mobilized its emergency operations within 20 minutes of the 
first earthquake rumblings. Twenty-seven-thousand <ORGANIZATION>National Guardsmen</ORGANIZATION> were 
placed on alert. Hundreds of off-duty doctors and nurses poured into <LOCATION>Bay Area</LOCATION> 
emergency rooms. 
</P>
<P>
By <TIME>10 p.m.</TIME>, emergency service officials from <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Sacramento</LOCATION> were saying 
tentatively that their medical and emergency services response was proceeding 
smoothly and as planned. If anything, they said, the volume of calls for help 
seemed ominously low. 
</P>
<P>
Into the night, they waited anxiously for the anticipated onslaught. 
</P>
<P>
"We were lucky," ventured <PERSON>Dr. Michael Callaham</PERSON>, director of the emergency 
department at <ORGANIZATION>UC San Francisco's Moffitt-Long Hospital</ORGANIZATION>, in a telephone 
interview. "But I think what's happening is there are people pinned in rubble 
who won't be extricated for hours. Or, they may be dead." 
</P>
<P>
The full effects of the collapse of the Nimitz Freeway were just beginning to 
be felt in Oakland-area hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
Many hospitals lost power. One had no water. Structural damage forced several 
small facilities to evacuate. But on the whole, officials reported that their 
emergency rooms were functioning well and that so far, serious injuries had 
been surprisingly few. 
</P>
<P>
Ambulances in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> made what Mayor Art Agnos described as an almost 
record number of runs, despite jammed traffic, rubble and impassable streets. 
Some ambulances could not reach the city's designated trauma centers so they 
headed simply for the closest hospital. 
</P>
<P>
On a statewide level, the <ORGANIZATION>Office of Emergency Services</ORGANIZATION> had received calls for 
help from just three municipalities: The cities of <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION> called 
in early for 25 additional fire engines; the town of <PERSON>Felton</PERSON> in the <LOCATION>Santa Cruz 
Mountains</LOCATION> requested 40. 
</P>
<P>
Dozens of officials gathered at the <ORGANIZATION>state Office of Emergency Services</ORGANIZATION> 
headquarters in <LOCATION>Sacramento</LOCATION>, including representatives of the <ORGANIZATION>Red Cross</ORGANIZATION>, state 
police and <ORGANIZATION>Emergency Medical Services Authority</ORGANIZATION>. There they waited to dispatch 
help upon request. 
</P>
<P>
"We have not been overwhelmed with reports (of casualties)," said <PERSON>William 
Metegavich</PERSON>, director of emergency services for the state. He described the 
radio circuits as "very active" -- a good sign that the dearth of calls was not 
the result of system breakdown. 
</P>
<P>
In <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION>, officials at <ORGANIZATION>Merritt-Peralta Medical Center</ORGANIZATION>, one of the city's 
largest hospitals, were forced to evacuate an outpatient facility that was 
damaged in the quake. But hospital officials said the emergency room remained 
surprisingly quiet well into the <TIME>night</TIME>. 
</P>
<P>
About 35 people were admitted to the emergency room during the first three 
hours, according to <PERSON>Gerrie Shields</PERSON>, a Merritt-Peralta spokeswoman. Most of the 
injuries consisted of broken bones and bruises. Ten were admitted and two 
underwent surgery. 
</P>
<P>
At nearby <ORGANIZATION>Providence Hospital</ORGANIZATION>, however, ambulances had to be diverted after the 
emergency room became overloaded, <PERSON>Shields</PERSON> said. Shortly before <TIME>10 p.m.</TIME>, <PERSON>Shields</PERSON> 
said, "We are just now trying to figure out if we can anticipate having more 
come in." 
</P>
<P>
Across the bay at <ORGANIZATION>UC San Francisco</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Moffitt-Long Hospital</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Callaham</PERSON> said there 
had been "a small number of very seriously injured people." <PERSON>Callaham</PERSON> said 150 
doctors and as many nurses had poured in to help out with what had begun to 
look like "really low volume." 
</P>
<P>
Power had gone out, leaving the hospital dependent upon its emergency 
generator. Some elevators were immobilized. Callaham suggested the real test of 
the hospital's preparedness would come later when the more seriously injured 
were dug out and brought in. 
</P>
<P>
At <ORGANIZATION>San Francisco General Hospital</ORGANIZATION>, about two dozen injured people had been 
brought in to the emergency room by <TIME>late Tuesday night</TIME>. Most had bruises, cuts 
and broken bones. Hospital workers said only three cases appeared to be 
serious, including one person with a head injury from falling off a ladder. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, two hospitals in <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION> were reported to be without power. A <LOCATION>San 
Mateo</LOCATION> hospital reported serious damage. Kaiser Permanente evacuated two floors 
of a facility in <LOCATION>Santa Clara</LOCATION> after gas began leaking as a result of the quake. 
</P>
<P>
In <LOCATION>Sacramento</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Office of Emergency Services</ORGANIZATION> stood by to dispatch fleets of 
fire trucks used usually by the state forestry department. Caltrans officials 
said they had gotten maintenance crews on the scene "almost immediately" to 
begin examining bridges and overpasses. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Col. <PERSON>Ronald Bright</PERSON> of the state's military department said his agency's 
emergency response was running smoothly: 400 <ORGANIZATION>National Guardsmen</ORGANIZATION>, mostly in 
helicopter units, were assembling at military bases around the state to be 
ready to fly in if needed. 
</P>
<P>
Among the military facilities put on alert were a helicopter air ambulance unit 
at <ORGANIZATION>Mather</ORGANIZATION> and a large cargo helicopter unit at <LOCATION>Stockton</LOCATION>. Bright said the <ORGANIZATION>143rd 
Combat Support Field Hospital Unit</ORGANIZATION> based at <ORGANIZATION>Los Alamitos Reserve Center</ORGANIZATION> in 
<LOCATION>Orange County</LOCATION> was also put on notice in case a field hospital was needed. 
</P>
<P>
"So far, it's been chaotic but smooth," said Sgt. <PERSON>Ray Miller</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Oakland 
Police Department</ORGANIZATION>, expressing an opinion shared by others. Asked to elaborate, 
<PERSON>Miller</PERSON> said: "We're really busy. But it's being handled."

   Three strong aftershocks rattled a jittery
<LOCATION>Northern California</LOCATION> on <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, and rescuers who found fewer cars
than feared under a collapsed freeway said the World Series may
have reduced the rush-hour traffic.
   ``Maybe we got lucky because of the game,'' <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION> police Sgt.
<PERSON>Bob Crawford</PERSON> said. ``Normally at 5 o'clock in the afternoon this
area would be bumper-to-bumper. Maybe the World Series saved our
lives.'
   Power and commuters returned to much of downtown <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>
as a tentative city tried to recover and regroup following
<DATE>Tuesday</DATE>'s earthquake, which claimed scores of lives and at least
<MONEY>$2.87 billion</MONEY> in damage.
   Residents of the ravaged <LOCATION>Marina</LOCATION> district, furious at initially
being barred from their homes, later lined up for 15-minute passes
to fetch clothing, medicine, food and belongings.
   At the 1\-mile stretch of the collapsed double-deck Interstate
880, the <ORGANIZATION>Nimitz Freeway</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION>, workers cut holes in concrete
and used cranes to pull out pancake-flat cars. Rescuers reported
finding the cars as far apart as 60 feet, rather than
bumper-to-bumper as had been feared, Assistant Fire Chief <PERSON>Al
Sigwart</PERSON> said.
   That could lower the death toll in the highway rubble _
estimated earlier at 253, authorities said.
   ``They are going lower, much lower in fact,'' <PERSON>Lisa Covington</PERSON>, a
spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION>Office of Emergency Services</ORGANIZATION>, said of the
estimates. ``What's happening is that they are finding fewer
vehicles under the bridge than they thought.''
   Firefighter <PERSON>Dan Getreu</PERSON> said he had walked the length of the
fallen highway and estimated no more than two dozen cars were
trapped.
   No new official estimate of fatalities was made.
   Many people left work early to watch the third game of the World
Series, scheduled to start at <TIME>5:30 p.m.</TIME>, and 60,000 people already
were across the bay in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> at <LOCATION>Candlestick Park</LOCATION> when the
quake struck at <TIME>5:04 p.m.</TIME>
   The World Series will resume <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> at <LOCATION>Candlestick Park</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>San
Francisco</LOCATION>.
   Oakland Mayor <PERSON>Lionel Wilson</PERSON> said <DATE>Thursday</DATE> that only 85 people
were officially reported missing.
   On <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME>, three aftershocks struck south of <LOCATION>San
Francisco</LOCATION>. The first, measuring 5.0 on the Richter scale of ground
motion, hit at <TIME>3:15 a.m.</TIME> and was centered near <LOCATION>Watsonville</LOCATION>, about
eight miles from the epicenter of <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>'s 6.9 quake, according to
the <ORGANIZATION>state Office of Emergency Services</ORGANIZATION>. Two other aftershocks
measured 4.5.
   ``No one is really sleeping around here,'' <LOCATION>Watsonville</LOCATION> resident
<PERSON>John Murphy</PERSON> said.
   ``I can't stop shaking,'' said 73-year-old <PERSON>Marcelina Toussaint</PERSON>.
``I guess I'm surviving, but I'm scared.''
   Fifty-six people were treated at a <LOCATION>Watsonville</LOCATION> community clinic,
mostly for bruises and frazzled nerves, city spokeswoman <PERSON>Lorraine
Washington</PERSON> said. About 150 people were evacuated from a <ORGANIZATION>National
Guard Armory</ORGANIZATION> shelter after a natural gas leak.
   <LOCATION>Watsonville</LOCATION> issued a plea for additional doctors and nurses.
   Some homes that were damaged in the initial quake collapsed
under the power of the aftershocks. Many residents of the town of
30,000, part of <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>'s ``salad bowl'' region where much of
the nation's lettuce, asparagus and artichokes are grown, spread
across lawns and vacant lots like refugees.
   ``We're talking about people with no resources, no money for
food and no money for health care,'' said <PERSON>Barbara Garcia</PERSON>, executive
director of <ORGANIZATION>Salud Pera La Gente</ORGANIZATION>, a state-financed community clinic.
   As of early <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, more than 1,400 aftershocks had been
recorded. The strongest, 5.2 on the Richter scale, struck within 40
minutes of the initial jolt, according the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Geological Survey</ORGANIZATION>.
   Across the <LOCATION>Bay</LOCATION> area, the nation's fourth-largest metropolitan
area with more than 6 million people, shaken cities tried to cope
as best they could with still-limited services, strapped police and
fire departments and transportation havoc created by the closing of
freeways and the Bay Bridge, the lifeline that links <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>.
   A transportation department spokesman said a large marine barge
crane was being moved into place to lift the fallen upper deck slab
of the bridge, which might be reopened in three weeks.
   Frustration and despair were evident on city streets.
   <PERSON>Dan Lai</PERSON> sat on a curb in the ravaged <LOCATION>Marina</LOCATION> district with his
head in his hands, crying.

<LEADPARA>  East Bay commuters awoke this morning to a logistical nightmare: Sunday's fire
had closed two of the primary links connecting Contra Costa and northern
Alameda counties with Oakland and San Francisco.;   With authorities unsure of
when those routes would reopen, traffic officials were advising commuters to
add anywhere from 90 minutes to three hours to get to work today, and the
California Highway Patrol continued to urge commuters to avoid state highways
24 and 13, as well as Interstate 580 between those two routes.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     For <TIME>this afternoon</TIME>, the commuting picture is clouded. BART is a key factor
in the traffic pattern, and officials had not decided <TIME>early this morning</TIME> which
<LOCATION>East Bay</LOCATION> routes would be open.;   Three major problems faced commuters this
morning:;   (check) The Caldecott Tunnel on state Highway 24, where on a
normal weekday more than 40,000 cars travel from <ORGANIZATION>Walnut Creek</ORGANIZATION> to Interstate
580 in <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION>, remained closed after fire burned all around the tunnel
Sunday.;   (check) A six-mile stretch of Highway 13, connecting Highway 24
with Interstate 580 in <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION>, also was closed, and officials could not
predict when it would reopen.;   (check) And BART trains from <LOCATION>Concord</LOCATION> into
<LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> were shut down between the Rockridge and <LOCATION>Orinda</LOCATION>
stations because of fire in and around BART's <LOCATION>Berkeley Hills</LOCATION> tunnel.;   About
70,000 commuters ride this BART line on a typical <DATE>Monday</DATE>, and <ORGANIZATION>Bay Area Rapid
Transit</ORGANIZATION> officials scrambled to meet today's demand with additional bus
service, said spokesman <PERSON>Sy Mouber.</PERSON>;   Authorities were advising visitors to
avoid <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION> today and encouraged motorists to use these
alternatives:;   (check) Bay Bridge commuters traveling from the north could
use Interstate 80 and then take the <ORGANIZATION>Richmond-San Rafael Bridge</ORGANIZATION> to <LOCATION>Marin</LOCATION>. That
connects with Highway 101 and the Golden Gate Bridge into <LOCATION>San Francisco.</LOCATION>;  
(check) If coming from the east, motorists could use interstates 238 and 880
to the <LOCATION>San Mateo</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Dumbarton</LOCATION> bridges.;   The fire was so big and so out of
control that harried officials had few words of comfort for commuters other
than the standard advice about carpooling and avoiding unnecessary trips.;  
"Everything is just contingent on the parameters of the fire," said a <ORGANIZATION>CHP</ORGANIZATION>
spokeswoman, Sgt. <PERSON>Pat Tracy.</PERSON>;   "It depends on the wind," she added.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>
   A strong earthquake jolted <LOCATION>Northern
California</LOCATION> on <DATE>Monday</DATE>, causing <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> skyscrapers to sway and
briefly halting commuter trains, but there were no immediate
reports of damage or injury.
   The state <ORGANIZATION>Office of Emergency Services</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Sacramento</LOCATION> said the
quake hit 5.2 on the Richter scale, while the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Geological
Survey</ORGANIZATION> office in <LOCATION>Menlo Park</LOCATION> said the quake registered 5.0.
   The epicenter, <ORGANIZATION>USGS</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON>Pat Jorgenson</PERSON> said, was about 16
miles south of <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION>, along the <LOCATION>San Andreas Fault</LOCATION>. The time was
set at <TIME>11:43 a.m.</TIME>, she added.
   There were no indications of injury or damage, <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION> police
said.
   The quake was felt over a large area, extending from <LOCATION>Santa Rosa</LOCATION>,
about 60 miles north of <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, to the <LOCATION>Santa Cruz</LOCATION> area 70
miles to the south.
   The temblor lasted up to 10 seconds in many areas. The 38 trains
running on Bay Area Rapid Transit lines were halted briefly to
allow a check for track damage and then allowed to resume operation.
   ``It hit real hard like something going into the side of the
building. Nothing fell, but light standards swayed back and
forth,'' said <PERSON>Tom Honig</PERSON>, city editor of the <ORGANIZATION>Santa Cruz Sentinel</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>Walt Glines</PERSON>, news editor of The Dispatch in <LOCATION>Gilroy</LOCATION>, said half
the workers in the newspaper's city room ``didn't even notice'' the
rolling quake, which he said seemed to hit that area in two waves.
   ``The first time, I thought it was a caffeine rush. But when the
second one hit, I knew,'' he said.
   A <LOCATION>South San Francisco</LOCATION> police dispatcher, who identified herself
only as <PERSON>Pat</PERSON>, said her department had received a few calls, but none
reporting damage.
   ``I sure felt it,'' she said. ``There were two shocks.''
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energey released by an
earthquake, as measured by ground motion recorded on a seismograph.
Each increase of one number means the ground motion was 10 times
greater.
   On <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, a moderate earthquake shook a wide area of <LOCATION>Southern
California</LOCATION>, but there were no reports of serious damage. At least
four people were treated for minor injuries.
   The temblor was felt in downtown <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> and as far away as
<LOCATION>Saugus</LOCATION>, some 70 miles northwest of the epicenter, and <LOCATION>Palm Springs</LOCATION>,
about 70 miles to the east. It was followed by several aftershocks.
   The quake in <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION>, centered 3 miles
north-northwest of <LOCATION>Upland</LOCATION>, struck at <TIME>8:04 a.m.</TIME> and registered 4.5
on the Richter scale, according to <PERSON>Robert Finn</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>California
Institute of Technology Seismology Lab</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Pasadena</LOCATION>. Instruments at
the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Geological Survey</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Golden</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Colo.</LOCATION>, recorded a slightly
higher reading of 4.7.
   Upland, in <LOCATION>San Bernardino County</LOCATION>, is a city of about 50,000
people located 40 miles east of <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>.

   Fans stood for a moment of silence, then
let out a whooping cheer <DATE>Friday</DATE> as the World Series resumed 10 days
after a devastating earthquake.
   Rescue workers threw out the first ball and the crowd joined in
singing the <DATE>1936</DATE> song ``<LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>'' in opening ceremonies that
began with a moment of silence for those killed and injured in the
quake.
   ``We've had enough time for mourning. Now it's time to celebrate
life,'' said <PERSON>Jean Alvers</PERSON>, 62, who wore a yellow hard hat. ``This
series needs to be played. If they canceled it it would have been a
lot harder to do other things.''
   ``It was OK to be excited,'' said <PERSON>Donna Verhorst</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Oakland Athletics</ORGANIZATION> defeated the <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> Giants 13-7,
giving the Athletics a 3-0 advantage in the best of seven series.
   The first cheer went up when the scoreboard lit up with,
``Welcome Back to Game 3'' _ and the stadium shook again, not from
the quake but the roar of the fans.
   Some less fortunate fans watched the game from <ORGANIZATION>Red Cross</ORGANIZATION>
shelters where televisions were set up for the thousands of people
left homeless.
   ``It takes your mind off the earthquake, and that's good for the
nerves,'' said <PERSON>Winston Presley</PERSON>, 54, as he sat with a cluster of A's
fans in the gymnasium of <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Lowell Middle School</ORGANIZATION>.
   For many, the resumption of the Bay Bridge World Series, its
symbol now fractured by the quake, was a kind of therapy in the
wake of the deadly tremor.
   ``Time heals all wounds,'' said <PERSON>Ray Torres</PERSON>, another fan. He and
a friend, <PERSON>Alphonso Castaneda</PERSON>, had seats two rows from the top of
the stadium, and <PERSON>Castaneda</PERSON> had made a banner that read, ``Upper
deck parachute rental.''
   As fans filed in, the public address system periodically said,
``In the event of an aftershock, don't panic ...''
   ``I think it's my attempt to conquer my own fears,'' said <PERSON>Steven
Walch</PERSON> of his decision to attend the game. Having seen Candlestick
shudder and crack, he added, ``I want to be at the World Series,
and I don't think it's more unsafe ... than any other place. And I
want to get back to my normal life.''
   The organizers of the game tried to help. Throwing out the first
balls were 12 representatives of <LOCATION>Bay</LOCATION> area agencies who assisted in
relief efforts.
   They included workers from the <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> Fire Department,
<ORGANIZATION>Highland General Hospital</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Pacific Gas &amp; Electric</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>San
Francisco Police Department</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>California Department of
Transportation</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>California Conservation Corps</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Oakland Fire
Department</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Santa Cruz County Red Cross</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Santa Cruz County
Salvation Army</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Pacific Bell</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>San Francisco Sheriff</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Department</ORGANIZATION>,
and the <ORGANIZATION>California Highway Patrol</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``We've realized we need all this. Baseball can be part of this
area's mental therapy,'' said <ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION> manager <PERSON>Roger Craig</PERSON>.
   ``Baseball is the most resilient of all American institutions,''
said Commissioner <PERSON>Fay Vincent</PERSON>, who announced a <MONEY>$1.4 million</MONEY> gift
from baseball to earthquake relief.
   Mail Vincent received from around the country after the quake
urged that the series be called off, he said <DATE>Friday</DATE>, adding that he
understood the feelings. ``But I don't think there is any
disrespect in going on with the World Series,'' he said.
   <PERSON>Dave Stewart</PERSON>, starting pitcher for the <ORGANIZATION>Oakland Athletics</ORGANIZATION>, said
the players have had difficulty preparing for the game.
   ``We've all been through a national tragedy. I'm sure I'm not
alone, but the earthquake had a deep psychological effect on me,''
<PERSON>Stewart</PERSON> said.
   San <ORGANIZATION>Francisco Giants</ORGANIZATION> outfielder <PERSON>Brett Butler</PERSON> said the game gave
62,000 fans ``a chance to let out all that frustration and hurt and
trauma. This is <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s game. It's going to bring all of us in
this area back together again.''
   <LOCATION>San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos</LOCATION> agreed. ``We all need a respite,''
he said. ``We can enjoy the World Series and still remember those
we lost and those who are still affected by this tragedy.''
   Six people remained unaccounted for, authorities said, and the
death toll rose <DATE>Friday</DATE> to 64, including an 88-year-old <LOCATION>San Mateo</LOCATION>
woman who was pronounced dead of a heart attack shortly after the
quake but who had not previously been listed among the dead.
   Thirty-nine of those killed were in the collapse of
double-decked Interstate 880 in <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION>. As demolition there
continued, the search for more bodies was delayed because the road
was too shaky.
   In other quake developments:
   _ Dockworker Buck Helm, rescued after four days in the rubble of
I-880, remained in serious condition in <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Highland General
Hospital</ORGANIZATION>. He was said to be conscious most of the time.
   _ <PERSON>Julio Berumen</PERSON>, the 6-year-old whose leg was amputated during
rescue from the I-880 rubble, was listed in good condition and
improving at <ORGANIZATION>Children's Hospital</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION>. His sister <PERSON>Cathy</PERSON>, 8,
was in serious but stable condition following surgery <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
They lost their mother in the freeway collapse. About <MONEY>$48,000</MONEY> has
been donated to a fund for them.
   _ On <DATE>Friday</DATE>, 150 relatives and friends gathered at an <ORGANIZATION>El Cerrito</ORGANIZATION>
cemetery for the funeral of a woman killed on the collapsing
portion of the Bay Bridge. Anamafi <PERSON>Filoli Moala</PERSON> was buried in a
ceremony typical of the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> island of <LOCATION>Tonga</LOCATION>, with dirges and
many of those present wearing palm grass skirts.
   _ In <LOCATION>Santa Cruz</LOCATION> on <DATE>Friday</DATE>, a wrecker's ball crashed into the
imposing <ORGANIZATION>Cooper House</ORGANIZATION>, a downtown landmark and centerpiece of the
heavily damaged <ORGANIZATION>Pacific Garden Mall</ORGANIZATION>. Some who watched the
demolition, which began <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, dabbed at tears. For 94 years the
huge brick building was a gathering point for the seaside tourist
town.
   ``We will come back, better than it was,'' said 86-year-old <PERSON>Bill
Davidson</PERSON>.
   _ Lawyer <PERSON>Melvin Belli</PERSON> on <DATE>Friday</DATE> filed <MONEY>$22 million</MONEY> worth of
claims against the state on behalf of 10 victims of the collapse of
I-880. If the claims _ <MONEY>$3 million</MONEY> for each of two wrongful deaths
and <MONEY>$2 million</MONEY> for each of eight injured survivors _ are rejected
by the state, civil lawsuits would be filed, <PERSON>Belli</PERSON> said.
   _ A convention of traumatic stress experts that coincidentally
came to <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> a few days after the earthquake held a
seminar on the disaster <DATE>Friday</DATE>, with experts saying everyone in the
area needed to talk about the experience and to use jokes to
relieve stress.
   ``The use of humor is good,'' said <PERSON>Dr. Tom Williams</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Aurora</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Colo.</LOCATION>, of the <ORGANIZATION>Society for Traumatic Stress Studies</ORGANIZATION>. ``There's so
much irony.'' People in the area have swung through a gamut of
emotions including shock, excitement and euphoria at being alive,
he said.

   Bridge and highway collapses will disrupt truck and auto transportation in the <LOCATION>San Francisco Bay</LOCATION> area for months to come. 

   But rail, air and ocean-shipping links to the area escaped <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>'s earthquake with only minor damage, and many are expected to be operating normally today, government and corporate transport officials said. 

   Air traffic at <LOCATION>San Francisco International Airport</LOCATION> was running about <PERCENT>50%</PERCENT> of normal yesterday afternoon, but airport officals said they expect a return to full operations by <DATE>Saturday</DATE>. 
The major gateway to <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> and one of the nation's 10 busiest airports was closed to all but emergency traffic from the time the quake hit <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME>, until <TIME>6 a.m. PDT yesterday</TIME> when controllers returned to the tower. 

   Getting to and from the airport in coming weeks may be the problem, however. 
"People's ability to drive throughout the bay area is greatly restricted," said a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION>American Automobile Association</ORGANIZATION>. 

   <PERSON>Tom Schumacher</PERSON>, executive vice president and general manager of the <ORGANIZATION>California Trucking Association</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Sacremento</LOCATION>, said his organization urged trucking firms to halt all deliveries into the <DATE>Bay area yesterday</DATE>, except for emergency-medical supplies. 
"Some foodstuff shipments will probably resume <DATE>Thursday</DATE>," he said. 
"Right now most of the roads into the <LOCATION>Bay</LOCATION> area are closed, but the list of closings changes about every 20 minutes. 
This {<DATE>Wednesday</DATE>} <TIME>morning</TIME> the <LOCATION>San Mateo</LOCATION> bridge was open and now we are informed that it is closed," <PERSON>Mr. Schumacher</PERSON> said. 

   <ORGANIZATION>United Parcel Service</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Greenwich</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Conn.</LOCATION>, said its operations in the <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> area have been reduced to <PERCENT>40%</PERCENT> of normal. 
A <ORGANIZATION>UPS</ORGANIZATION> spokesman said that although none of the company's terminals, trucks or airplanes were damaged in the quake, road shutdowns and power failures have impeded its pickup and delivery of packages. 
The spokesman noted four-hour to five-hour traffic delays on the <LOCATION>San Mateo</LOCATION> bridge, for example. 
In addition, power failures prevented its package-sorting facilities from operating, causing delays. 

   But freight railroads reported that damage to their facilities was relatively minor, with <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Pacific Corp.</ORGANIZATION>'s rail unit the least affected by the quake. 
<ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> stopped freight trains <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> night while its officials inspected track but resumed service at <TIME>10:45 p.m.</TIME> when they found no damage. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Union Pacific Corp.</ORGANIZATION>'s rail unit said that except for damage to shipping containers in its <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION> yard, its track, bridges and structures were unharmed. 
That railroad is operating trains but with delays caused by employees unable to get to work. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific Transportation Co.</ORGANIZATION>, the hardest hit of the three railroads in the <LOCATION>Bay</LOCATION> area, said service on its north-south coastline, which is used by an <ORGANIZATION>Amtrak</ORGANIZATION> train between <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Seattle</LOCATION>, was suspended temporarily because of kinked rails near the epicenter of the quake. 
But service on the line is expected to resume by noon today. 
"We had no serious damage on the railroad," said a <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> spokesman. 
"We have no problem to our freight service at all expect for the fact businesses are shut down." 

   <ORGANIZATION>Amtrak</ORGANIZATION> said it suspended train service into its <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION> station, which sustained "heavy structural damage" during the quake. 
The passenger railroad said it terminated some runs in <LOCATION>Sacramento</LOCATION>, relying on buses to ferry passengers to the <LOCATION>Bay</LOCATION> area. 
<ORGANIZATION>Amtrak</ORGANIZATION> said it planned to resume some train operations to <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION> late yesterday. 

   Rail-transit operations suffered little damage, according to <PERSON>Albert Engelken</PERSON>, deputy executive director of the <ORGANIZATION>American Public Transit Association</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>. 
The Bay Area Rapid Transit "withstood the earthquake perfectly," said <PERSON>Mr. Engelken</PERSON>, adding that the rail system was running a full fleet of 45 trains during the day to provide an alternative for highway travelers. 
"The highway system is screwed up" by the earthquake, <PERSON>Mr. Engelken</PERSON> said. 
"The transit system is how people are going to be getting around." 
He added that <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>'s trolley cars and trolley buses were also running at full service levels. 

   Although air-traffic delays in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> were significant yesterday, they didn't appear to spread to other airports. 
The earthquake shattered windows at <LOCATION>San Francisco International</LOCATION>'s air-traffic control tower and rained pieces of the ceiling down on controllers, three of whom suffered minor injuries. 
Terminals at <LOCATION>San Francisco International</LOCATION> also were damaged, but the tower itself was intact. 
<DATE>Tuesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>, thousands were diverted to other airports and had to wait a day to resume travel. 

   Runways at <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> weren't damaged, but traffic was being limited yesterday to 27 arrivals and 27 departures an hour -- down from 33 to 45 an hour normally -- mainly because the noise level in the control tower was overwhelming without the windows, an <ORGANIZATION>FAA</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman said. 

   While the airport was closed, flights were diverted to airports in <LOCATION>Sacramento</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Stockton</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>; <PERSON>Reno</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Las Vegas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Nev.</LOCATION>; and <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>United Airlines</ORGANIZATION>, the largest carrier at <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, was operating only <PERCENT>50%</PERCENT> of its scheduled service in and out of the area because of damage to its terminal, which in turn was causing delays for travelers headed to the Bay area. 
A <ORGANIZATION>United</ORGANIZATION> spokesman said 14 of its 21 gates were unusable, mainly because of water damage caused when a sprinkler system was triggered by the tremors. 

   The <ORGANIZATION>United</ORGANIZATION> spokesman said none of its people were injured at the airport; in fact, as the airport was being evacuated <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>, two babies were born. 

   Yesterday, the <ORGANIZATION>United</ORGANIZATION> ticket counter was active, with people trying to get flights out, but the airline said demand for seats into the city also was active, with people trying to get there to help family and friends. 

   The airports in <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION> were both fully operational by noon yesterday, the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Aviation Administration</ORGANIZATION> said. 

   In terms of diversions, <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Stapleton International</ORGANIZATION> may have experienced the most far-flung: A <ORGANIZATION>United</ORGANIZATION> flight from <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> was rerouted there. 
"I think that's the first nonstop commercial passenger flight from <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> to land here," an airport spokesman said. 

   A <ORGANIZATION>Japan Air Lines</ORGANIZATION> spokesman said its flights into and out of <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> weren't affected, but getting information about its operations was difficult. 
Its telecommunications headquarters in <LOCATION>Burlingame</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, had been knocked out since the quake. 
"We're in the dark," he said.

   A burned-out cabin light on a <ORGANIZATION>United

plane carrying 115 passengers to return to <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> airport,
airline officials reported.
   ``There was no fire, just smoke,'' said <ORGANIZATION>United</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>Joe

from airport tower officials had said there was a fire on board.
   <PERSON>Hopkins</PERSON> said the smoke stopped when the plane's captain turned

   ``The passenger reaction was quite good,'' said <PERSON>Hopkins</PERSON>. ``In
fact, one passenger joked and said he thought this was a no-smoking
flight.''
   The plane had just taken off for <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> when the emergency
happened. It turned around near <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION>, a few minutes out of <LOCATION>San

to the gate, where passengers were let off, said tower spokesman <PERSON>Joe

the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Aviation Administration</ORGANIZATION>, airport administration
officials reported.

<TEXT>
   Physical and emotional scars persist six
months after the killer earthquake jolted the <LOCATION>San Francisco Bay</LOCATION>
area, but most businesses and residents are back on solid ground.
   Economic activity has nearly regained its pre-quake level,
analysts say, and estimates of the cost of damage caused by the
massive temblor have been scaled back.
   The damage is widespread, nevertheless. The elevated section of
Interstate 880 in <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION>, where 42 people died when the road
collapsed <DATE>Oct. 17</DATE>, has been dismantled while discussions continue
about whether to rebuild or reroute it.
   The similarly elevated <ORGANIZATION>Embarcadero Freeway</ORGANIZATION> stands forlorn near
downtown <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> while politicians and business people debate
whether it should be replaced or rebuilt.
   Two sections of busy Highway 101 in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> are under
repair, intensifying rush-hour traffic jams, and some small
businesses in hard-hit <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Los Gatos</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Santa Cruz</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Watsonville</LOCATION> are still awaiting federal loans for reconstruction and
inventory replacement.
   In downtown <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION>, where many empty buildings are surrounded
by chain-link fences, the Emporium department store isn't expected
to reopen until <DATE>August</DATE>. The store suffered more than <MONEY>$10 million</MONEY> in
damage when display windows shattered, stairwells collapsed and the
exterior brick facade cracked.
   Small tremors, shrugged off or barely noticed by the <LOCATION>Bay</LOCATION> area's
six million residents before the 7.1 magnitude quake <DATE>last fall</DATE>, now
trigger memories of the tragedy that claimed 68 lives and worries
about the really big one that geologists say is bound to come.
   But the region's economy, on the whole, has rebounded vigorously
with no evidence of long-term damage.
   From the computer and chip companies in <LOCATION>Silicon Valley</LOCATION> to the
retail and financial giants in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>Bay</LOCATION> area remains
one of the most vibrant centers of economic activity in the country.
   Retail business in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> is now about <PERCENT>96 percent</PERCENT> of
normal, said Deputy Mayor <PERSON>James Ho</PERSON>. That's despite the fact that
some hard-hit sections _ <LOCATION>Chinatown</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>North Beach</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>South of Market</ORGANIZATION>,
Fisherman's Wharf and the Mission _ continue to suffer. Business in
those areas is down from 8 to <PERCENT>18 percent</PERCENT>, <PERSON>Ho</PERSON> said.
   An economic index based on measures of activity in real estate,
retailing, services, international trade, manufacturing and tourism
for the nine <LOCATION>Bay</LOCATION> area counties shows the region's economy virtually
recovered from the quake by <DATE>December</DATE> after a small dip in <DATE>October</DATE>
and <DATE>November</DATE>.
   The index compiled by <PERSON>Tapan Munroe</PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION>Pacific
Gas &amp; Electric Co.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, and <PERSON>Walter E. Hoadley</PERSON>, a
Hoover Institution senior fellow, showed the overall strength of a
diversified economy that had long planned on ways to cope with a
big quake.
   ``The preparedness paid off,'' <PERSON>Munroe</PERSON> said. ``The region fared
very well in terms of emergency services.''
   Early estimates of <MONEY>$7 billion</MONEY> to <MONEY>$10 billion</MONEY> in damage have been
scaled down, but <PERSON>Munroe</PERSON> said the current figure of <MONEY>$5.6 billion</MONEY>
from state officials is still too high.
   Hotel and restaurant owners said their businesses still suffer,
though hotel occupancy rates in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> are close to normal
even after the post-quake opening of two new large hotels, said
<PERSON>Steve Reiser</PERSON> of the accounting firm <PERSON>Pannell Kerr Forster</PERSON>.
   Passenger arrivals at <LOCATION>San Francisco International Airport</LOCATION> were
off <PERCENT>11.8 percent</PERCENT> in <DATE>October</DATE> and <PERCENT>4 percent</PERCENT> in <DATE>November</DATE> from the same
months in <DATE>1988</DATE>. But arrivals were up <PERCENT>0.7 percent</PERCENT> in <DATE>December</DATE>.
   Fewer travelers from within the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> are coming to <LOCATION>San
Francisco</LOCATION> this year because of higher domestic air fares, but
international arrivals are booming, said airport spokesman <PERSON>Ron
Wilson</PERSON>.
   <PERSON>Ray Brady</PERSON>, research director for the <ORGANIZATION>Association of Bay Area
Governments</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION>, said the region pulled through the quake so
easily because the economy is decentralized. When the Bay Bridge
collapse cut traffic in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, he noted, retail sales went
up in the <LOCATION>East Bay</LOCATION> _ so total retail sales in the region remained
constant.
   Traffic began rolling over the repaired Bay Bridge a month after
its partial collapse, and workers are continuing to repair the two
closed sections of Highway 101.
   <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> Mayor Art Agnos wants to replace the <ORGANIZATION>Embarcadero
Freeway</ORGANIZATION>, long considered an eyesore, with an underground
expressway. The city's <ORGANIZATION>Board of Supervisors</ORGANIZATION> approved the plan
<DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> despite a three-hour strike by <LOCATION>Chinatown</LOCATION> merchants,
who claim that repairing the existing roadway would be cheaper and
get business traffic back into the depressed area more quickly.

   Thousands of stranded office workers
mingled with homeless people in downtown streets as a pitch black
night fell over the blacked out, earthquake-damaged city.
   Fire engines and ambulances, sirens howling, picked their way
through profound darkness as the sky turned indigo and a few stars
peeked through a layer of smoke from a fire in the <LOCATION>northern Marina</LOCATION>
district early today.
   The occasional office building or hotel running on emergency
generators stood out in the blackness. Electrically powered
trolleys formed little empty holes of light where they stalled,
emergency blinkers winking in and out.
   Car headlights criss-crossed and pedestrians dodged among them.
   Elderly residents of the Fox Plaza office building's penthouses
sat in complete darkness in the mezzanine, listening to the radio.
   ``We're in charge. It's under control. The citizens have
responded nobly,'' said Mayor Art Agnos. ``I think we were very
organized and we were very lucky. We were well prepared.''
   Thousands of downtown office workers were left with no major
transportation routes to homes across the water in areas of the
<LOCATION>East Bay</LOCATION>.
   Part of the top deck of the <LOCATION>San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge</LOCATION>
collapsed onto the lower road. The BART commuter train was shut
down.
   After a two-hour bus ride bypassing the closed bridges over the
bay, writer <PERSON>Michael Mercer</PERSON> arrived at his <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION> home with ``just
enough moonlight to see that my apartment has been trashed by the
quake.
   ``I was going to rearrange things anyway,'' he said.
   Others stayed in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, strolling around, helping to
direct traffic or meeting friends in bars. Little looting or
vandalism was reported. People sat outside dingy hotels, on the
stoops of apartment houses, on curbs.
   An eerie, pale orange moon rose over the city.
   Among the buildings that remained lit were <ORGANIZATION>San Francisco General
Hospital</ORGANIZATION> and the elegant new <PERSON>Davies Symphony Hall</PERSON>, a glass and
brass structure with bright, full-length windows.
   The <LOCATION>Marina</LOCATION> district, where a huge fire consumed a block of
buildings, was without power. Emergency vehicles covered a
10-square-block area. Streets buckled everywhere and the smell of
natural gas permeated the air.
   A three-story apartment building collapsed. Its top story was
left intact _ its windows looking out at street level.
   <PERSON>Loretta Mild</PERSON>, a resident of <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> for 14 years, urged a
policeman to go inside the collapsed building to look for survivors.
   Officer <PERSON>Kris Kvale</PERSON> said he had been inside what was left of the
building, found nobody but conceded ``there's no way to get down
there'' below the rubble.
   Daddy <PERSON>Paul</PERSON>'s, a Chestnut Street bar, remained open after the
quake, doing brisk business by candlelight, though it was not a
boisterous scene.
   ``We just stopped in here to get out of the earthquake,'' said
<PERSON>Bob Levine</PERSON>, who was aboard his boat when the quake hit.
   ``It jumped out of the water a little at first and then twice.''
   <PERSON>Levine</PERSON> said he helped fire fighters carry hoses and carry a burn
victim out of the big apartment fire, then helped shut off four
public gas mains before ending up at the bar to meet friends.
   Red Cross officials set up a relief center at the <LOCATION>Marina</LOCATION> middle
school, bringing in supplies and cots as several hundred people
crowded at the entrance to get in.
   Elsewhere, two Cambodian families set up a makeshift camp on a
park lawn after massive cracks opened in the walls of their old
apartment building.
   Chhoeut Sun, 12, said his family could not go back home, had no
food and would remain in the camp.

   Private groups and officials from <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Charleston</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>S.C.</LOCATION>, offered help to the ruptured <LOCATION>San Francisco Bay</LOCATION> area, but some
said relief for the earthquake could drain coffers already strained
by previous disasters.
   <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, long <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>West Coast</LOCATION> competitor but
equally at the mercy of the <LOCATION>San Andreas Fault</LOCATION>, quickly shipped
doctors, sonic equipment and fire investigators to the <LOCATION>Bay Area</LOCATION>.
   The mayor of a sister city in disaster, <LOCATION>Charleston</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Joseph P.
Riley Jr.</PERSON>, sent a plane load of drinking water, a symbolic return
of the support his city got after Hugo.
   ``I know we still have and will have great needs here and
charity certainly begins at home,'' <PERSON>Riley</PERSON> said. ``However, it would
be wrong for this community ... not to reach in (our pockets) and
contribute to those who are hurt and suffering right now.''
   <LOCATION>San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos</LOCATION> has estimated damage <MONEY>$2 billion</MONEY> in
his city alone.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Salvation Army</ORGANIZATION> had the food cooking almost before the earth
quit shaking in <LOCATION>Northern California</LOCATION>, while the <ORGANIZATION>Red Cross</ORGANIZATION> opened the
doors and unfolded cots in 25 shelters.
   ``We don't wait for anybody,'' said Col. <PERSON>Leon Ferraez</PERSON>,
communications director of the <ORGANIZATION>Salvation Army</ORGANIZATION>. ``We're there the
minute the news is on.''
   According to <ORGANIZATION>Ferraez</ORGANIZATION>, the organization dispatched 12 mobile
canteens to the hardest-hit earthquake areas within minutes. All
<ORGANIZATION>Salvation Army</ORGANIZATION> centers in the <LOCATION>Bay Area</LOCATION>, including 34 community
service centers and scores of other units, have been turned over to
the relief effort.
   <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> donated sonic equipment to help detect sounds of
people trapped in rubble. And officials in <LOCATION>Los Alamos</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.M.</LOCATION>,
dispatched a device used to locate survivors of last year's
Armenian quake.
   Israel offered the services of a special army rescue squad that
also helped dig out victims in <LOCATION>Armenia</LOCATION>. A French disaster relief
agency offered to send special teams of searchers.
   A team of British engineers were to fly to <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> today
to help assess structural damage from the quake.
   The <LOCATION>Bay Area</LOCATION> has a large Asian population, and callers from
<LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION> and other countries jammed phone lines
trying to reach relatives.
   The <LOCATION>Osaka</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, city government announced it was sending
<MONEY>$10,000</MONEY> to <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, a sister city since <DATE>1957</DATE>.
   <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON>Tom Bradley</PERSON> sent police and fire investigators
to assess damage from the quake, and convened his own emergency
council in a special meeting to discuss other possible measures.
   ``I am joining millions of Californians as we intensely watch
the damage of the large <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> earthquake,'' said <PERSON>Bradley</PERSON>.
``We all know the horrors of an earthquake and we express our
deep-felt sympathy for the people of the <LOCATION>San Francisco Bay</LOCATION> area.''
   An <ORGANIZATION>Anheuser-Busch Inc.</ORGANIZATION> brewery in <LOCATION>Fairfield</LOCATION>, 35 miles northeast
of <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, interrupted normal operations to fill cans with
drinking water instead of beer for free shipment to relief
agencies, the company said.
   <ORGANIZATION>Coast Guard</ORGANIZATION> offices across the <LOCATION>West Coast</LOCATION> provided <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>
with as many boats and helicopters as could be spared, said <ORGANIZATION>Coast
Guard</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON>Elizabeth Neely</PERSON>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Red Cross</ORGANIZATION> sent 290 units of blood from <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>; the <LOCATION>San
Diego Blood Bank</LOCATION> rushed 50 units to <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> within an hour of
the quake; more than 400 units were sent from <LOCATION>Portland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ore</LOCATION>.
   ``Giving makes them feel good,'' said <PERSON>Trudy Sullivan</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Red
Cross</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman in <LOCATION>Portland</LOCATION>.
   Even the <ORGANIZATION>Internal Revenue Service</ORGANIZATION> got into the act, announcing
it would waive penalties for taxpayers unable to file returns or
make scheduled payments because of the earthquake.
   President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> directed <MONEY>$273 million</MONEY> in immediate aid for quake
victims and said he would visit the area <DATE>Friday</DATE> or <DATE>Saturday</DATE>.
   But some officials said the disaster could strain the coffers of
private agencies and those of the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Emergency Management
Agency</ORGANIZATION>, which was criticized for its response to the storm-lashed
<LOCATION>Carolinas</LOCATION>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Red Cross</ORGANIZATION> began its fiscal year <DATE>July 1</DATE> with <MONEY>$18.5 million</MONEY> in
its disaster budget, and had spent <PERCENT>40 percent</PERCENT> by <DATE>September</DATE>. Then
Hugo came along, triggering an effort the agency estimates will
cost <MONEY>$42 million</MONEY> _ the most ever.
   ``When a major earthquake and a major hurricane hit
back-to-back, you can bet it will stretch Red Cross disaster
resources and manpower,'' said <PERSON>Bob Vessey</PERSON>, director of disaster
services in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION>

   Hundreds of fighters were losing ground against the sweep of a
nearly 20,000-acre wildfire in <ORGANIZATION>Bridger-Teton National Forest</ORGANIZATION>
wilderness as it edged its way to within a mile of <ORGANIZATION>Yellowstone
National Park</ORGANIZATION>.
   But in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> firefighters made headway <DATE>Friday</DATE> against two
fires that have cost more than <MONEY>$6 million</MONEY> and charred 12,500 acres
in rugged mountains 150 miles east of <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>.
   And air and ground reinforcements were called in overnight as
crews continued to fight a brush fire in <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION> that had nearly
tripled in size <DATE>Friday</DATE> to 1,100 acres.
   The twin arson-suspected fires in <LOCATION>Calavaras County</LOCATION> east of <LOCATION>San
Francisco</LOCATION> have razed six homes, nine outbuildings, seven vehicles
and a tractor since they began <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
   Firefighters had the fires <PERCENT>75 percent</PERCENT> encircled by their control
lines <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> and expected full containment by <DATE>Saturday</DATE>
<TIME>evening</TIME>, said <PERSON>Marilyn Richards</PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION>California
Department of Forestry</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>San Andreas</LOCATION>.
   But the more than 800 firefighters using almost 20 miles of hose
near <LOCATION>Yellowstone</LOCATION> weren't so fortunate as they tried to keep fire
from crossing the forest's <ORGANIZATION>Yellowstone Meadows</ORGANIZATION>, also known as
<LOCATION>Thoroughbred Meadows</LOCATION>, into the park.
   Most growth in the lightning-caused Teton fire was attributed to
``spotting,'' when winds carry hot embers into areas separate from
the main fire.
   Park officials have said they expect the fire to move into a
remote backcountry section of the park within the next few days.
   Fire Information Officer <PERSON>Pam Gardner</PERSON> said <DATE>Friday</DATE>, however, that
the blaze was still more than 30 miles from any major park
attractions, and Yellowstone officials continued to stress they
have not closed any facilities.
   <PERSON>Richards</PERSON> said the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> fires had cost a total of nearly
<MONEY>$6.4 million</MONEY>, including timber and property loss and fire
suppression efforts. Some of the firefighters were sent home
<DATE>Friday</DATE>, leaving about 2,800 to battle the blazes.
   The fires charred nearly 12,500 acres, leaving flames to gnaw
mostly at uninhabited timber country in <LOCATION>Calaveras County</LOCATION>.
   Meanwhile, some 60 miles south of <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, an
out-of-control brush fire threatened homes <DATE>Friday</DATE> as hundreds of
firefighters attempted to gain control of the blaze in steep
terrain near <LOCATION>Morgan Hill</LOCATION>.
   The fire, spurred by hot temperatures and slight winds, had
burned about 140 acres by <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>, according to the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>
forestry department. There were no reports of structural damage and
no evacuation was anticipated at the fire site, about 1 mile west
of <ORGANIZATION>Morgan Hill</ORGANIZATION>.
   In <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION>, a full fire team was called in to organize the
battle on <ORGANIZATION>Bureau of Land Management</ORGANIZATION> land some five miles north of
<ORGANIZATION>Canon City on Cooper Mountain</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>BLM</ORGANIZATION> dispatchers said late <DATE>Friday</DATE>.
   ``We will have ten 20-person hand crews'' on the firelines
<DATE>Saturday</DATE>, supported by two slurry bombers, two helicopters and 11
truck pumpers, dispatchers said.
   The fire, dubbed the Dinosaur Fire because it is near fossil
sites, was burning through an old logging area in steep terrain and
mainly was consuming pinon, juniper and oak brush.
   A blaze broke out <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME> on the <LOCATION>Spokane</LOCATION> Indian
Reservation northwest of <LOCATION>Spokane</LOCATION> and grew to about 1,500 acres
within hours, said <PERSON>Dan Curd</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Bureau of Indian Affairs</ORGANIZATION> fire
management officer in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> state. Several homes on the
reservation and campers at nearby <LOCATION>Fort Spokane</LOCATION> were evacuated, but
there was no report of property loss in that fire.
   Curd said the fire jumped lines with ease because of shifting
winds.

   Business and civic operations lurched back toward normalcy here as congressional officials estimated that the price tag for emergency assistance to earthquake-ravaged <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> would total at least <MONEY>$2.5 billion</MONEY>. 

   "That is a minimum figure, and I underscore minimum," said <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON>Thomas Foley</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Wash.</LOCATION>) after conferring with <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> lawmakers. 
"It's impossible to put an exact figure on it at this time." 

   The <ORGANIZATION>Office of Management and Budget</ORGANIZATION> has begun looking into legislation to provide more funds for earthquake repairs. 
And <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>'s 45-member delegation in the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> is expected to propose that emergency funds be added to a stop-gap spending bill that the <ORGANIZATION>House Appropriations Committee</ORGANIZATION> is to consider <DATE>Monday</DATE>. 

   For the most part, major corporations' headquarters and plants were unaffected or only slightly damaged by <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>'s earthquake, which registered 6.9 on the Richter scale. 
One of the last big employers in the <LOCATION>Silicon Valley</LOCATION> to report in, <ORGANIZATION>Seagate Technology</ORGANIZATION>, said it expects to be back at full strength <DATE>Monday</DATE>. 
The day before the quake, <ORGANIZATION>Seagate</ORGANIZATION> completed three days of emergency training and drills. 

   Echoing the response of almost all big corporations in the <LOCATION>Bay Area</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Don Waite</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Seagate</ORGANIZATION>'s chief financial officer, said, "I wouldn't expect this to have any significant financial impact." 

   The city's recovery from the earthquake was uneven. 
Banks indicated they were operating at greater than <PERCENT>90%</PERCENT> of their usual capacity, but a <LOCATION>Nob Hill</LOCATION> hotel said tourists had fled, leaving the previously full hotel with an <PERCENT>80%</PERCENT> vacancy rate. 
City crews tallied the wreckage to buildings, but lacked a clear sense of how gravely transportation arteries were disabled. 
Among the city's banks, <ORGANIZATION>Bank of America</ORGANIZATION> said all but eight of its 850 branches were open. 
The closed branches, in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Hayward</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Santa Clara</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Santa Cruz</PERSON>, sustained structural damage. 
Power failures kept just seven of its 1,500 automated-teller machines off-line. 
Securities-trading operations were moved to <ORGANIZATION>Bank of America</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>Concord</LOCATION> office, and foreign-exchange trading operations were shifted to <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, the bank said. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Wells Fargo &amp; Co.</ORGANIZATION> said its <ORGANIZATION>Emergency Operations Committee</ORGANIZATION> -- which met all night <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> -- moved its global-funds transfer system to <LOCATION>El Monte</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, 500 miles to the south. 
Only five of 496 branches statewide remain closed, while 23 of 600 automated-teller machines remained out of order. 

   The most extensive damage was in small towns near the quake's epicenter, 80 miles south of <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>. 
<LOCATION>Santa Cruz County</LOCATION> estimates total damage at nearly <MONEY>$600 million</MONEY>. 
<LOCATION>Santa Clara County</LOCATION> has a running total so far of <MONEY>$504 million</MONEY>, excluding the hard-hit city of <LOCATION>Los Gatos</LOCATION>. 

   Oakland officials were still uncertain about the magnitude of structural damage late yesterday; a section of I-880, a twotiered highway, collapsed in <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION>, causing a majority of the deaths resulting from the quake. 

   <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> Mayor Art Agnos estimated that damages to the city total <MONEY>$2 billion</MONEY>. 
That includes dwellings in the ravaged <LOCATION>Marina</LOCATION> district that must be demolished, peeled business facades south of Market Street, and houses in the city's outer <LOCATION>Richmond</LOCATION> district that were heaved off their foundations. 
Many streets and sidewalks buckled, and subterranean water mains and service connections ruptured. 

   The federal funds would go to a range of programs, including the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Emergency Management Agency</ORGANIZATION>, highway construction accounts and the <ORGANIZATION>Small Business Administration</ORGANIZATION>, according to Rep. <PERSON>Vic Fazio</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>). 

   <ORGANIZATION>FEMA</ORGANIZATION>, which coordinates federal disaster relief, is already strapped by the costs of cleaning up after Hurricane Hugo, which hit the <LOCATION>Carolinas</LOCATION> <DATE>last month</DATE>. 
It is likely to get as much as <MONEY>$800 million</MONEY> initially in additional funds, and eventually could get more than <MONEY>$1 billion</MONEY>, according to <PERSON>Mr. Fazio</PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION>House Appropriations Committee</ORGANIZATION>. 

   <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>Marlin Fitzwater</PERSON> said there is enough money on hand to deal with immediate requirements. 
The <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration has at its disposal <MONEY>$273 million</MONEY> in funds remaining from the <MONEY>$1.1 billion</MONEY> <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> released for the cleanup after Hurricane Hugo. 

   "We feel we have the money necessary to handle the immediate, short-term requirements," <PERSON>Mr. Fitzwater</PERSON> said. 
He added that the <ORGANIZATION>Office of Management</ORGANIZATION> and Budget, the <ORGANIZATION>Transportation Department</ORGANIZATION> and other agencies are "developing longer-term legislation" that should be ready soon. 

   Much of the cost of cleaning up after the earthquake will involve repairing highways and bridges. 
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION> lawmakers are seeking changes in rules governing the federal highway relief program so more money can be made available for the state. 

   Some things can't be repaired. 
The Asian Art Museum in <LOCATION>Golden Gate Park</LOCATION> reports <MONEY>$10 million</MONEY> to <MONEY>$15 million</MONEY> in damage, including shattered porcelains and stone figures. 
Its neighbor, the <ORGANIZATION>De Young Museum</ORGANIZATION>, totaled <MONEY>$3 million</MONEY> to <MONEY>$5 million</MONEY> in structural damage and shattered sculpture. 

   The city's main library is closed because of fissures that opened in its walls, and marble facings and ornamental plaster at the <ORGANIZATION>Beaux Arts City Hall</ORGANIZATION> broke off in the temblor. 

   The ground along the Embarcaderothe street that skirts the city's eastern boundary and piers -- dropped six inches after the quake, wreaking major damage to at least one of the piers. 
At <LOCATION>San Francisco International Airport</LOCATION>, shock waves wrecked the control tower, knocking down computers and shattering glass. 
Offices of the city's <ORGANIZATION>Rent Board</ORGANIZATION> were destroyed. 

   Mayor Agnos's <MONEY>$2 billion</MONEY> estimate doesn't include damage to freeway arteries leading into the city, some of which remained closed. 
A major chunk of the <MONEY>$2 billion</MONEY> is expected to be eaten up by overtime for city workers deployed in the emergency, said a spokesman for <PERSON>Mr. Agnos</PERSON>. 
"All of the city's <MONEY>$5.9 million</MONEY> emergency reserve was spent in the first 24 hours" on overtime salaries, he said. 

   Insurers struggled to to get a firm grasp on the volume of claims pouring into their offices. 

   At <ORGANIZATION>Fireman's Fund Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, a spokesman said 142 claims were received in the first 24 hours after the quake, and the company is braced for as many as 5,000 claims from its 35,000 residential and 35,000 business policyholders in the affected area. 

   "Claims range from a scratched fender -- and there were an awful lot of cars damaged in this -- to a major processing plant," a spokesman said. 
"We're delivering a check for <MONEY>$750,000</MONEY> to an automotive business in <LOCATION>Berkeley</LOCATION> that burned on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>." 

   Fireman's is part of a <MONEY>$38 million</MONEY> syndicate that supplies business interruption insurance to the city on the <LOCATION>Bay Bridge</LOCATION>, which must pay employees during the three weeks or more it is expected to be out of service and deprived of toll income. 

   <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> lawmakers want to eliminate temporarily a <MONEY>$100 million</MONEY> cap on the amount of federal highway relief for each state for each disaster, as well as a prohibition on using the emergency highway aid to repair toll roads. 

   In addition, under the highway-relief program, the federal government provides <PERCENT>100%</PERCENT> of emergency highway aid for only the first 90 days of a repair effort. 
After that, the federal share diminishes. 
For interstate highways, the federal share normally would drop to <PERCENT>90%</PERCENT> of the cost of repairs, and the state would have to pick up the remainder of the cost. 
But lawmakers want to extend the period for <PERCENT>100%</PERCENT> federal funding for several months. 

   Those changes also would apply to two areas hit hard by Hurricane Hugo -- <LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>U.S. Virgin Islands</LOCATION>, according to an aide to Rep. <PERSON>Fazio</PERSON>. 

   Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION>FEMA</ORGANIZATION> announced a toll-free telephone number (800-462-9029) to expedite service to victims of the earthquake. 
Lines will be available 24 hours a day to take applications for such disaster relief as temporary housing and emergency home repairs by phone. 

   Transportation officials are expecting utter traffic pandemonium beginning <DATE>Monday</DATE> and growing worse over the next several weeks. 
Some 250,000 cars normally cross the closed Bay Bridge between <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> daily. 
Officials say it is clear that alternate routes can't handle the overflow. 

   The state is calling in a flotilla of navy landing vessels and other boats to expand ferry service across the bay and hopes to add numerous new bus routes and train departures to help alleviate the traffic problem. 
Moreover, state officials are urging freight haulers to bypass many of the area's main highways and to travel late at night or during predawn hours. 
Even so, "We're looking for chaos," said <PERSON>George Gray</PERSON>, a deputy district director at the <ORGANIZATION>California Department of Transportation</ORGANIZATION>. 
"If there's any way you can do it, you ought to go to <LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION> and go fishing for a while." 

   Most of <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>'s tourists and business travelers already have left -- despite hotel's offers of rate cuts. 
"Everyone left," said <PERSON>Peter Lang</PERSON>, reservations manager of the <ORGANIZATION>Mark Hopkins Hotel</ORGANIZATION>. 

   The <ORGANIZATION>Westin St. Francis</ORGANIZATION> hotel, which survived the <DATE>1906</DATE> earthquake and fire, currently is less than <PERCENT>50%</PERCENT> occupied. 
"We still have our die-hard baseball fans," a spokesman said. 
"One lady from <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> said she's not going home until the {World Series} is over."

   An explosion at a <ORGANIZATION>Shell Oil</ORGANIZATION> refinery
touched off a huge fire <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> that injured at least two
people and sent a plume of smoke thousands of feet into the air,
authorities said.
   ``It rattled all the windows in my home,'' said <PERSON>Robert Langston</PERSON>,
a <LOCATION>Benicia</LOCATION> resident who lives seven miles from the plant.
   <PERSON>Jane Tocher</PERSON>, an engineering assistant at <ORGANIZATION>Shell</ORGANIZATION>, said the plant
was shut down following the explosion about <TIME>6:35 p.m.</TIME>, but the fire
continued to burn out of control <TIME>two hours later</TIME>. Ambulances were
standing by at the refinery's main gate.
   Two contract employees for <ORGANIZATION>Shell</ORGANIZATION> were injured and taken to
<ORGANIZATION>Brookside Hospital</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>San Pablo</LOCATION>. One man had second-degree burns on
<PERCENT>25 percent</PERCENT> of his body, mainly on his back and arms, said hospital
spokeswoman <PERSON>Cynthia Crawford</PERSON>. He was reported in good condition in
the hospital's burn unit.
   The other worker also was in good condition with second-degree
burns.
   The flames in the light-oil processing unit came from ``bleed-off
valves'' in pipes designed to burn off excess fuel during an
accident, said <ORGANIZATION>Shell</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>Bill Sharkey</PERSON>. The unit, which
occupies about 15 acres of the 800-acre facility, is entirely
constructed of metal.
   The cause of the explosion and fire were unknown, he said.
   Neighborhoods were not being evacuated, but the sky over <PERSON>Martinez</PERSON>
was thick with black smoke that billowed several thousand feet into
the sky over the plant.
   The smoke gradually was being blown northeastward toward the
<ORGANIZATION>Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta</ORGANIZATION>, which is sparsely populated. It
stretched for more than 15 miles by <TIME>early evening</TIME>.
   Residents throughout the region said they heard a big blast
followed by a loud rushing sound, which one <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> radio
caller described as ``like three jet engines starting up.''
   <PERSON>Langston</PERSON> said the roaring sound lasted five minutes.
   The big explosion was followed by more than a dozen smaller ones,
some of which could be felt as far away as the original blast and
several releasing large balls of fire over the proceccing unit.
   Shell firefighters were handling the blaze. Martinez city
firefighters were at the plant's gate, but had not been asked to
help. A county fire truck was loaned to <ORGANIZATION>Shell</ORGANIZATION>.
   The refinery is 40 miles northeast of <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> on the
<LOCATION>Carquinez Strait</LOCATION>, a 10 mile stretch of water that run from the <LOCATION>San
Francisco Bay</LOCATION> to the <ORGANIZATION>delta</ORGANIZATION>.

   A 15-second earthquake caused a
transportation nightmare that will last for months as <LOCATION>Bay</LOCATION> area
residents cope with collapsed freeways, damaged bridges, landslides
and twisted rail lines.
   With major arteries closed between <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> to points south
and east, freeways jammed up starting at dawn today in the populous
southern section from from <LOCATION>Hayward</LOCATION> in the east to <LOCATION>Gilroy</LOCATION> in the
west. Traffic in the northern part of the nine-county region was
lighter, but gridlock was expected by midday.
   ``This is just a nightmare. This is something nobody ever
believed would happen, to cut <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> off from the <LOCATION>East
Bay</LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON>Andrew Nevin</PERSON>, 41, of <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION>, who got up at <TIME>3 a.m.</TIME> to
drive into <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Nevin</PERSON>, who normally commutes 18 miles, had a circuitous 45-mile
trek.
   The Bay Area Rapid Transit line between <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION> closed <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> because of a reported leak in the tube
under <LOCATION>San Francisco Bay</LOCATION> but it reopened later. The load today was
slightly less than the normal 50,000, said spokesman <PERSON>Mike Healy</PERSON>.
``We expect people will be coming in a little later than usual
because they're trying to figure out how best to get into the
city.''
   That link had become especially vital after the quake cut off a
main route _ the <LOCATION>San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge</LOCATION>, where a 50-foot
section collapsed. The subway closing left ferries as the only
remaining direct link between the cities. Ferry service was
bolstered from <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION> vessels.
   Motorists still may get across the bay using bridges north or
south of the Bay Bridge, but each is at least 25 miles out of the
way.
   <ORGANIZATION>California Department of Transportation</ORGANIZATION> officials said the
collapsed section of the Bay Bridge was to be lifted today so they
could estimate how long repairs will take.
   The quake also collapsed a 1\-mile section of Interstate 880, a
major artery near the bridge in <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION>. Authorities estimated 250
people were killed when the highway's upper deck fell onto the
lower level during rush hour.
   <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Transportation Secretary <PERSON>Samuel Skinner</PERSON>, who viewed the
wreckage <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> from the air, said repairs could take 18 months.
``One of the things you are going to have to do is to plan how you
are going to in the next year or year and a half deal with the fact
that 880 is not going to be operational.''
   In an effort to ease the burden for commuters, Los Angeles-based
Catalina Cruises sent four 700-passenger vessels to supplement
ferry service, said <PERSON>Terry Koenig</PERSON>, general manager.
   Closer to the quake's epicenter, about 55 miles south of <LOCATION>San
Francisco</LOCATION>, a landslide closed Highway 17 linking the <LOCATION>Bay</LOCATION> area with
<LOCATION>Santa Cruz</LOCATION>. Del Corral, of <ORGANIZATION>Raisch Construction</ORGANIZATION>, said it will take
at least two months to clear.
   Repairing the crippled highway network will cost at least <MONEY>$500
million</MONEY>, <ORGANIZATION>Caltrans</ORGANIZATION> officials told the state <ORGANIZATION>Transportation
Commission</ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION>Caltrans</ORGANIZATION> also said surveyors were inspecting about
1,500 bridges within 50 miles of the epicenter.
   Quake-damaged rail lines into <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION> from <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> stopped
<ORGANIZATION>Amtrak</ORGANIZATION>'s northbound <ORGANIZATION>Coast Starlight</ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION>Salinas</LOCATION>, about 60 miles from
<LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, said spokeswoman <ORGANIZATION>Sue Martin</ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION>Amtrak</ORGANIZATION> provided buses
to either <PERSON>Martinez</PERSON> or <LOCATION>Sacramento</LOCATION>, where other trains continued the
trip into the <LOCATION>Pacific Northwest</LOCATION>.
   There were no immediate estimates on when the <ORGANIZATION>Amtrak</ORGANIZATION> lines would
be fixed.
   The historic <ORGANIZATION>Amtrak</ORGANIZATION> passenger terminal in <LOCATION>West Oakland</LOCATION> likely
will be torn down because it was so damaged, officials said.
   <LOCATION>San Francisco International Airport</LOCATION> was open, but some airlines
cut operations due to quake-damaged terminals. <ORGANIZATION>United Airlines</ORGANIZATION>' <PERSON>Joe
Hopkins</PERSON> said the quake forced the carrier to cancel 16 of 136 daily
flights <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
   <LOCATION>Oakland Airport</LOCATION> also was open, but its main runway was closed.

<TEXT>
<P>
Workers zeroed in on remaining bodies buried under tons of freeway concrete 
<DATE>Friday</DATE> and scientists pinpointed the epicenter of the mammoth earthquake 
beneath a mountain creek. President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> toured ravaged areas to offer sympathy 
and aid. 
</P>
<P>
Damage estimates climbed to more than <MONEY>$5.5 billion</MONEY> throughout the 75-mile-long 
region. Officials declared the ornate 78-year-old <ORGANIZATION>Oakland City Hall</ORGANIZATION> unusable, 
and 26 buildings were closed indefinitely at <ORGANIZATION>Stanford University</ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION>Palo 
Alto</LOCATION>, 35 miles south of <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
So far, 54 bodies of quake victims have been recovered. Dozens remain listed as 
missing. 
</P>
<P>
To make matters worse, rain and temperatures in the 30s were forecast for the 
area over the weekend. Authorities said that could hamper rescue efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"It depends on how hard the rain is. If it's not too hard we hope to be able to 
work through it," said <PERSON>Bob Jacobs</PERSON>, deputy district director of the <ORGANIZATION>California 
Department of Transportation</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Rain also heightened the threat of additional landslides in the mountains north 
of <LOCATION>Santa Cruz</LOCATION>, where 60 homes already have been destroyed in <LOCATION>Boulder Creek</LOCATION>, a 
town of 6,800. 
</P>
<P>
About 100 residents were ignoring evacuation warnings. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a dangerous area, but all my stuff is here. My dogs are here. I figured 
you go down with the ship. Where do you go?" said <PERSON>Todd Viele</PERSON>, 27. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Bush</PERSON> walked over chunks of concrete beside the 1 1/4-mile crumpled stretch of 
<LOCATION>Interstate 880</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION> where scores of people were feared entombed and 
talked with rescue workers. He said he hoped to offer encouragement. 
</P>
<P>
"I am deeply moved by this, saddened in some ways, yet very stimulated by this 
team effort," the President said. 
</P>
<P>
Ironworker <PERSON>Joe Carter</PERSON> said the President asked him how his rescue crew felt. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him . . . we're beat, we're tired, but we're still going at it," <PERSON>Carter</PERSON> 
said. <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> "let me know the eyes of the world are on us right now." 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials worked on a program of aid as the President made his 
trip. Transportation Secretary <PERSON>Samuel K. Skinner</PERSON> offered no price tag but said 
the federal government would take on "a very, very major role in helping 
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION>." 
</P>
<P>
In <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> officials have turned down 
offers of earthquake help from 20 countries because they believe they have 
enough resources at hand. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the <ORGANIZATION>San Francisco Giants</ORGANIZATION>, participants in baseball's suspended World 
Series, visited a downtown shelter <DATE>Friday</DATE> to hand out souvenir balls, caps and 
T-shirts to families left homeless by the quake. 
</P>
<P>
A moderate aftershock measuring magnitude 4.0 struck near <LOCATION>Santa Cruz</LOCATION> at 
<TIME>5:50p.m.</TIME>, according to the Seismagraphic Station at the <ORGANIZATION>University of 
California</ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION>Berkeley</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The epicenter was located in the <LOCATION>Santa Cruz mountains</LOCATION>, but there was no 
immediate information on an exact location, and no immediate reports of damage. 
</P>
<P>
At <TIME>1:13 a.m.</TIME> <DATE>Friday</DATE>, an aftershock of magnitude 3.9 was centered about seven 
miles southwest of <LOCATION>Los Gatos</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Berkeley</LOCATION> seismologists said. It was felt north 
and south of <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
More than 1,500 aftershocks have hit since <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists roaming through mountains southeast of <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> pinpointed the 
epicenter of <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>'s <TIME>5:04 p.m.</TIME> killer quake in the northeast corner of the 
<ORGANIZATION>Nisene Marks State Park</ORGANIZATION>, near the top of <LOCATION>Aptos Creek</LOCATION>, said <PERSON>Joseph Cotton</PERSON> with 
the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Geological Survey</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Menlo Park</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
That's about 57 miles from <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> atop the <LOCATION>San Andreas Fault</LOCATION>, and just 
14 miles northeast of hard-hit <LOCATION>Santa Cruz</LOCATION>, where 10,000 people were displaced 
from their homes. 
</P>
<P>
By late <DATE>Friday</DATE>, rescuers had pulled out 33 bodies from the wreckage of the 
collapsed double-deck section of Interstate 880 across the bay in <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION>. 
About 2,000 people were injured, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Searchers have found 52 cars in the lower section of the freeway, but there may 
be more still buried in the rubble, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> Highway Patrol Sgt. <PERSON>John Silva</PERSON> 
said. Authorities believe there are fewer than 30 cars remaining buried with 
bodies inside, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"You see a car that's crushed, a lot of debris, you usually find the people 
slumped over the steering wheel," said <PERSON>Alameda</PERSON> firefighter <PERSON>Matt Tunney</PERSON>, who 
spent the night helping remove five bodies. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd thought I'd seen everything. This is devastation, the worst disaster I've 
ever seen," he said. 
</P>
<P>
One firefighter had tears in his eyes after crawling into an 18-inch-high 
opening to pull out the bodies of a 6-year-old girl and her mother. 
</P>
<P>
"It kills you. It just kills you," said the firefighter, <PERSON>Lee Kraft</PERSON>. "The adults 
are no problem. But the kids. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Five psychologists are at the scene for the rescue workers. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, authorities had estimated that 253 people were buried -- based on an 
assumption that cars stretched bumper-to-bumper on the stretch of crushed lower 
level. The third game of the World Series, which was scheduled to begin shortly 
after the quake struck, may have kept commuters by televisions rather than on 
freeways, they said. 
</P>
<P>
No new official estimate of fatalities was made. Oakland police gave estimates 
of missing people <DATE>Friday</DATE> varying from 97 to 167. 
</P>
<P>
Electricity was restored to about <PERCENT>98%</PERCENT> of the area, utility spokesman <PERSON>Greg 
Pruett</PERSON> said. A fleet of boats assembled to ferry commuters across the <LOCATION>San 
Francisco Bay</LOCATION> as business got closer to normal. The main lifeline between <LOCATION>San 
Francisco</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>Bay Bridge</LOCATION>, was closed with a 50-foot section 
collapsed. Estimates for its reopening have grown more pessimistic, with some 
officials saying it could take as long as two months. 
</P>
<P>
Engineers hoped to use a floating crane to lift the fallen 200-ton, five-lane 
highway span onto a barge over the <DATE>weekend</DATE> and begin repairs, the 
transportation department said. 
</P>
<P>
Legislation to waive the <MONEY>$100-million</MONEY> cap on emergency federal highway funds 
was introduced in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Senate <DATE>Friday</DATE> so that <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> could receive extra 
money for repairing the Bay Bridge and other federal highways. 
</P>
<P>
In downtown <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION>, the quake ruined 13 commercial buildings and 1,400 
residential units, including housing for 100 elderly residents now in shelters, 
officials said. More than 200 other buildings were damaged. 
</P>
<P>
Only one case of looting was reported in <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION>, however, deputy Dist. Atty. 
<PERSON>John Adams</PERSON> said <DATE>Friday</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Crucial city services were moved from <ORGANIZATION>City Hall</ORGANIZATION> to the Fire Department, and 
judges were conducting routine court business in jails because of damage to the 
courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
The historic <ORGANIZATION>Amtrak</ORGANIZATION> railroad station in west <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION> incurred three big cracks 
and may have to be razed, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"One more good shake and the whole thing would have come down," said <ORGANIZATION>Amtrak</ORGANIZATION> 
employee <PERSON>Ron Young</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
In all, Mayor <PERSON>Lionel Wilson</PERSON> estimated damages in <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION> at <MONEY>$1.3 billion</MONEY> -- not 
including the Nimitz collapse. 
</P>
<P>
At <ORGANIZATION>Stanford</ORGANIZATION>, 26 building were closed indefinitely, and university President 
<PERSON>Donald Kennedy</PERSON> said the destruction "certainly is going to add up in the many 
tens of <MONEY>millions of dollars</MONEY>." 
</P>
<P>
In <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, Mayor Art <PERSON>Agnos</PERSON> said the city's <MONEY>$5.9-million</MONEY> reserve fund has 
been depleted. 
</P>
<P>
"On paper," he said, "the city is broke." 
</P>
<P>
Gov. <PERSON>George Deukmejian</PERSON> said he would not hesitate to propose temporarily 
raising state sales taxes if more money is needed to rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Deukmejian</PERSON> said there is precedent for such a temporary tax hike, adding that 
gasoline taxes sometimes have been increased to pay for road repairs from 
natural disasters.

   Back-to-back Super Bowl victories and a <LOCATION>San
Francisco Bay</LOCATION> area World Series provide bright but bittersweet
highlights for Northern Californians bowed under by a deadly
earthquake and string of ghastly crimes.
   Names in the news in the past year included a teamload of sports
stars and a busload of bad guys and alleged bad guys who share Page
One in local papers.
   While the <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> 49ers football team returned from <LOCATION>New
Orleans</LOCATION> on <DATE>Monday</DATE> after destroying the <ORGANIZATION>Denver Broncos</ORGANIZATION> 55-10, Mayor
Art Agnos awaited receipt of a dead fish. The <ORGANIZATION>Rocky Mountain</ORGANIZATION> trout
isn't a threat, it's the centerpiece of a dinner Agnos won in a
Super Bowl bet with the mayor of <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION>.
   Led by quarterback <PERSON>Joe Montana</PERSON>, <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> took the Super
Bowl trophy home for the fourth time as the <ORGANIZATION>National Football
League</ORGANIZATION>'s first repeat champion in a decade.
   The team made a triumphant return to the city <DATE>Monday</DATE> in a
downtown victory parade attended by 75,000 fans. Fans cheered ``Go
Niners!'' and sounded red plastic horns as <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>, coach <PERSON>George
Seifert</PERSON>, team owner <PERSON>Eddie DeBartolo</PERSON> and other players rode by in
flashy convertibles.
   The 49ers are being hailed as the ``team of the decades'' _ the
<DATE>'80s</DATE> and the '90s _ and the symbol of the region's resilience after
a year of disasters left it rattled but not ruined.
   ``It helped tremendously,'' <PERSON>Leo Bigley</PERSON>, 30, said of the 49ers
victory. ``The quake happened right during the football and
baseball seasons and took the spirit out of it. When the <ORGANIZATION>Niners</ORGANIZATION>
came back, it wasn't hysteria but all felt a commitment to this as
a way to show we can rebuild.''
   Or as <ORGANIZATION>San Francisco Examiner</ORGANIZATION> columnist <PERSON>Rob Morse</PERSON> wrote, ``The
49ers once again showed kinky <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> that dominance can be
thrilling.''
   Not far from the parade route, crews worked to repair damage on
<ORGANIZATION>Marina Boulevard</ORGANIZATION> caused by the <DATE>Oct. 17</DATE> earthquake that destroyed
stylish homes, sparked fires and knocked out utility service for
weeks.
   Thousands were left homeless and 67 people died in the 7.1
shudder centered in the <LOCATION>Santa Cruz Mountains</LOCATION>. Three months later,
families still live in shelters from the farming community of
<LOCATION>Watsonville</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>.
   Alternative routes of transportation had to be found for those
attending the remaining World Series baseball games between the <ORGANIZATION>San
Francisco Giants</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Oakland Athletics</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>October</DATE>. The quake struck
as Game 3 was about to begin at <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Candlestick Park</LOCATION>.
The Athletics won the series, 4-0.
   Giants' pitcher <PERSON>Dave Dravecky</PERSON> became a hero without even
playing. Dravecky returned to baseball last year after surgery to
remove a malignant tumor from his left arm. After a dramatic
first-game-back victory, the weakened bone snapped as he won his
second post-operation start.
   <LOCATION>Northern California</LOCATION> children were the focus of other news in
<DATE>1989</DATE>.
   Last <DATE>January</DATE> a man clad in military fatigues and armed with an
Chinese assault rifle killed five children and wounded 30 other
students and one teacher when he opened fire at <ORGANIZATION>Cleveland
Elementary School</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Stockton</LOCATION>, 75 miles east of <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>. He
then shot and killed himself.
   Authorities said <PERSON>Patrick Purdy</PERSON>, 24, had acted out a hatred for
minorities and chose children because of their vulnerability.
   Children also were among the alleged victims of <PERSON>Ramon Salcido</PERSON>,
charged with the slayings of his wife, two daughters and four
others during a bloody rampage <DATE>last April</DATE> in the scenic wine
country north of <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>. A widespread manhunt ended with
<PERSON>Salcido</PERSON>'s arrest in <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>.
   Death also was the fate of former Black Panther leader <PERSON>Huey
Newton</PERSON>, shot in <LOCATION>East Oakland</LOCATION> in <DATE>August</DATE> by a man police say was
trying to win favor with a drug-dealing street gang.

<TEXT>
   The devastating earthquake that killed
hundreds in northern <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> vividly recalls the catastrophic
quake and fire that laid waste to <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> in <DATE>1906</DATE>.
   Quakes are almost commonplace in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, with that state and
western <LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION> experiencing <PERCENT>90 percent</PERCENT> of the tremors recorded in
this country according to the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Geological Survey</ORGANIZATION>.
   But when the rare major quake comes, as it did in the nation's
second-deadliest quake on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, serious damage can result as
well as death and injury.
   And while the <LOCATION>West Coast</LOCATION> feels the earth shake more often,
shocks can strike any part of the nation.
   The new quake registered at 6.9 on the Richter scale and was on
the notorious <LOCATION>San Andreas Fault</LOCATION>. That reading made it the
sixth-most powerful quake to strike <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> this century, and
the mos powerful since a 7.0 quake centered in <LOCATION>Eureka</LOCATION> in <DATE>1980</DATE>.
   Such a quake can cause severe damage, with each increase of one
whole number meaning an increase of 10 times in strength.
   <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>'s devastating quake still is well short of the <DATE>1906</DATE> San
Francisco quake, however, which was estimated at 8.3 on the scale.
That disaster killed more than 700 people, largely in fires which
swept the city in the wake of the tremor.
   <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION> are subject to many quakes because they
rest on what is called the Ring of Fire, a region of volcanoes and
earthquake-prone lands circling the <LOCATION>Pacific Ocean</LOCATION>.
   This ring is caused by the movement of the giant plates that
underlie the land and oceans of the earth. Plates move gradually,
stresses build up over time and then are released in quakes.
   <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> sits astride the <LOCATION>San Andreas</LOCATION> fault, a crack in the
earth where the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> plate is slowly sliding north compared with
the rest of <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, which rests on the <ORGANIZATION>North American Plate</ORGANIZATION>. It
was the same fault that instigated the <DATE>1906</DATE> tremor.
   While the <DATE>1906</DATE> disaster is burned into American memory, this
country has been relatively fortunate, compared to other nations,
in terms of earthquake disasters.
   The 25,000 deaths reported in <LOCATION>Armenia</LOCATION> a year ago are fresh in
memory, and <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> had an estimated 650,000 deaths in a violent
quake in <DATE>1976</DATE>. <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> too has suffered many deaths in historic
quakes, as have <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Turkey</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Nicaragua</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Peru</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION> and other
nations.
   The 1906 <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> quake was the largest American death
toll, although at least two other events were stronger in terms of
the Richter scale.
   Here is a rundown of other major earthquakes in American history
as recorded by the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Geological Survey:
   _<LOCATION>New Madrid</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mo.</LOCATION>, was shaken by three quakes in 1811-1812
estimated at 8.4 to 8.7 on the Richter scale, but damage and
casualties were light because the region had a relatively small
population at the time. These quakes were felt as far away as
<LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>.
   _Prince <PERSON>William Sound</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION>, was pounded by a quake rated at
8.4 on the Richter scale, on <DATE>March 27, 1964</DATE>. In this century only
one quake, in <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION> in <DATE>1960</DATE>, has been stronger. There were 131
deaths and extensive damage in <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION>.
   _On <DATE>Nov. 18, 1867</DATE>, the <LOCATION>Virgin Islands</LOCATION> were shaken by a magnitude
7.5 quake also felt in <LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Dominican Republic</LOCATION>.
Waves as large as 20 feet were generated.
   _In the same area a 7.5 temblor shook the Mona passage near
<LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION> on <DATE>Oct. 11, 1918</DATE>. Some 116 people died, many in the
giant wave generated by the quake.
   _On <DATE>Aug. 17, 1959</DATE>, a quake rated at 7.3 struck <PERSON>Hebgen Lake</PERSON>,
<LOCATION>Mont.</LOCATION>, and was felt from <LOCATION>Seattle</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>North Dakota</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION>. Extensive
damage was reported and 28 people died.
   _<LOCATION>Olympia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wash.</LOCATION>, was struck by a 7.1 quake on <DATE>April 13, 1949</DATE>,
killing eight people and causing extensive damage in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Oregon</LOCATION>.
   _There was a quake rated 7.0 at <ORGANIZATION>Borah Peak</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION>, on <DATE>Oct. 25,
1983</DATE>. It was widely felt but only two people were killed.
   _<LOCATION>Coalinga</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, was the focus of a 6.7 magnitude quake on <DATE>May
2, 1983</DATE>, injuring 45 people and causing <MONEY>$31 million</MONEY> in damage.
   _On <DATE>Aug. 31</DATE>, 1886 <LOCATION>Charleston</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>S.C.</LOCATION>, suffered a 6.6 magnitude
quake killing 60 people. This tremor was felt as far away as
<LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Milwaukee</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Havana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION>.
   _A quake measured at 6.6 also did severe damage to the <LOCATION>San
Fernando Valley of California</LOCATION> on <DATE>Feb. 9, 1971</DATE>, killing 65 people.

   The <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION>, awaiting a request for aid from
the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Emergency Management Agency</ORGANIZATION>, was prepared to offer
whatever support is necessary to aid <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> earthquake victims,
spokesman <PERSON>Pete Williams</PERSON> said <DATE>today</DATE>.
   ``We are awaiting orders from <ORGANIZATION>FEMA</ORGANIZATION>. We are willing to respond
whenever we hear from them,'' <PERSON>Williams</PERSON> said.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> reported in a mid-day update that damage to
military facilities in the area around <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> was
``comparatively minor.''
   Structural damage, power outages, disruption of water supplies
and some broken gas lines were reported.
   Maj. Gen. <PERSON>Todd P. Graham</PERSON>, the deputy commanding general of the
6th <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> headquarters at the <LOCATION>Presidio</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, has been
named the disaster control officer on the scene, the <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> said.
   <ORGANIZATION>Defense</ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON>Dick Cheney</PERSON> ordered representatives from the
armed forces to set up an emergency working group to help
coordinate efforts to aid <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> earthquake victims, the
<ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> said in a statement.
   Cheney asked that the group, formally known as the <ORGANIZATION>Directorate
of Military Support</ORGANIZATION>, assist and coordinate relief efforts with <ORGANIZATION>FEMA</ORGANIZATION>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> spokesman Lt. <PERSON>Jim Wood</PERSON> said a pier buckled at the <ORGANIZATION>Alameda
Naval Air Station</ORGANIZATION>, causing two minor injuries. The 2,616-acre air
station, which serves as a site to overhaul and rebuild planes,
also reported major damage to its runways.
   People injured in the quake were being treated at the <ORGANIZATION>Letterman
Army Medical Center</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> and at the <ORGANIZATION>Naval Hospital</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION>, where 100 beds were made available. <LOCATION>Fort Ord</LOCATION>, near
<LOCATION>Monterey</LOCATION>, was providing blood, the <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> said.
   In addition, about 20 military police from the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> base at the
<LOCATION>Presidio</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, located near the Golden Gate bridge,
were helping local police to control traffic near the base.
   Naval vessels _ the frigate USS <PERSON>Lang</PERSON>, the replenishment oiler
USS <LOCATION>Kansas City</LOCATION> and the ammunition ship USS Flint _ were also
providing support. The <PERSON>Lang</PERSON> was moved from the <ORGANIZATION>Naval Station</ORGANIZATION> at
<LOCATION>Treasure Island</LOCATION> to help fight fires. The two other ships, which
have helicopter pads on board, were to remain at anchor and offer
their helicopters to give aid where necessary, the <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> said.
   The guided missile cruiser USS Gridley was also providing fresh
water and other resources for the <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION>'s training facilities on
<LOCATION>Treasure Island</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Wood</ORGANIZATION> said.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Naval Air Station</ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION>Moffet Field</LOCATION>, located near <LOCATION>Sunnyvale</LOCATION>,

   A flotilla of ferries and extra trains
helped keep rain-soaked traffic moving today, but only at a
bumper-to-bumper pace. Rescuers halted the search for survivors at
an earthquake-flattened freeway when the rubble became too unstable.
   And hospital officials said <DATE>today</DATE> survivor Buck Helm had
improved and they were considering upgrading his condition from
critical to very serious. Doctors said he was no longer in pain,
and they were hopeful the longshoreman pulled from the freeway
rubble would not have permanent kidney problems.
   ``In the <DATE>next 24</DATE> to 48 hours, if he continues the way he is now,
he will be out of the woods,'' <PERSON>Dr. Floyd Huen</PERSON> said.
   The death toll rose to 61 <DATE>today</DATE> with the recovery of two more
bodies in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, the coronor's office said. A female body
was found in the remains of a <LOCATION>Marina</LOCATION> district fire, and a
68-year-old woman died of injuries suffered from the quake near
downtown. Dozens remained missing and thousands were injured and
homeless.
   At the Interstate 880 disaster in <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION>, where 38 bodies have
been recovered, officials said <DATE>today</DATE> crews began dismantling a
100-yard section of the double-deck freeway that was near collapse.
   ``It is a dangerous operation,'' said <PERSON>Kyle Nelson</PERSON>, a spokesman
for the <ORGANIZATION>California Department of Transportation</ORGANIZATION>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> began putting together a <MONEY>$3 billion-plus</MONEY> package of
federal disaster, but put off until later how to come up with the
money to pay for it.
   ``There is an urgent need for help for people now,'' <PERSON>Sen. Pete
Wilson</PERSON>, <LOCATION>R-Calif.</LOCATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION>Senate Environment and Public Works</ORGANIZATION>
subcommittee on transporation and resources.
   Gale warnings were posted early today, rain was heavy in some
areas and one ferry was turned back because of rough waters on the
<LOCATION>San Francisco Bay</LOCATION>, authorities said. The Union Ferry Building, the
terminus of all ferries when they reach <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, was closed
for an hour because of high waves and the boats were diverted to a
pier about a mile away.
   But most made it to work without major problem, despite
predictions of commuter gridlock on the first full workday since
the earthquke closed crucial freeways and broke a section of the
vital Bay Bridge linking <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION>.
   ``Considering everything, my commute has really gone smooth,''
said <PERSON>Maggie Faulkner</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION>, who rode a ferry across the choppy
bay to <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>.
   Highway 101 was a sea of lights starting shortly after <TIME>5 a.m.
PDT</TIME> and the Golden Gate Bridge was bumper-to-bumper but moving. Bay
Area Rapid Transit, which runs trains underneath the bay, had
carried 70,000 passengers by <TIME>8:30 a.m.</TIME>, more than double the normal
load.
   Damage estimates from <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>'s earthquake topped <MONEY>$7 billion</MONEY>,
eclipsing Hurricane Hugo as the costliest natural disaster in <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
history, according to the <ORGANIZATION>Independent Insurance Agents of America</ORGANIZATION>.
   On <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, 150 residents of a housing project just 10 feet from
collapsed I-880 joined thousands of homeless because of fears that
more of the highway could fall.
   The unstable ruins forced authorities to halt rescue work <DATE>late
Sunday</DATE>.
   ``We know there are more victims, more cars. But we don't know
how many,'' said <ORGANIZATION>California Highway Patrol</ORGANIZATION> Capt. <PERSON>Mike Garver</PERSON>,
speaking about I-880.
   There was no estimate of when work could resume.
   ``It's kind of minute by minute,'' said <PERSON>Nelson</PERSON>.
   The first phase of the Bay Bridge repair started when workers
sawed a 50-foot collapsed section in half and lowered both halves
200 feet by crane <DATE>Sunday</DATE> to a barge on wind-whipped <LOCATION>San Francisco
Bay</LOCATION>.
   Without the Bay Bridge, 65,000 rush-hour motorists were forced
to seek other ways to work. Daily, 260,000 cars use the bridge, the
most crucial of the region's earthquake-disrupted roadways. Repairs
will take at least four weeks.
   ``You just can't squeeze all the traffic onto other bridges.
There just isn't enough room,'' said <PERSON>Joel Markowitz</PERSON>, a traffic
planner with the <ORGANIZATION>Metropolitan Transportation Commission</ORGANIZATION>. ``We're
going to have a crisis until people adapt a little.''
   Traffic planners took extraordinary precautions to avoid
rush-hour paralysis on the first full workday since the earthquake.
   Commuters were urged to take public transportation, buddy up in
carpools and come in earlier or later than normal. Fourteen ferries
were added to ease the bridge crisis, and extra police and tow
trucks were placedin choke zones in case something goes wrong.
   About 3 million people commute on a typical workday in the
nine-county region. Authorities warned that <MONEY>2 million</MONEY> of them could
be disrupted in a nightmarish obstacle course.
   MTC Chairman <PERSON>Rod Diridon</PERSON> said any motorist driving alone would
be ``doing an anti-social act.''
   Extra subway trains and ferries can accommodate an additional
45,000 riders. Other bridges must handle the rest of the traffic
that normally crosses the 8.5-mile-long Bay Bridge.
   Other freeways also are devastated. A 1\-mile section of I-880
is flattened, and the <ORGANIZATION>Embarcadero Freeway</ORGANIZATION> and the I-280 extension
are closed. Farther south, landslide-clogged Highway 17 is open
only to buses and emergency vehicles.
   The hospital where Helm was taken was deluged with flowers,
telegrams and phone calls for a survivor who had been given up for
dead.
   Helm, 57, regained some functions in his kidneys, which were
damaged by dehydration during his 89-hour ordeal. He was also
breathing better, but he was still having trouble moving his leg
and was being fed by a tube in intensive care, said officials at
<LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Highland General Hospital</ORGANIZATION>.
   Highway engineer <PERSON>Steven Whipple</PERSON>, the hero who found Helm, said
he was checking the ruins for stability when he spotted the back of
Helm's head and a slight movement in his flashlight's beam.
   ``It stopped my heart,'' said <PERSON>Whipple</PERSON>, 29, who works for the
state transportation department.
   In six subsequent sweeps of the section, sniffing dogs and
sensitive listening devices failed to detect any more survivors.
   Rescuers were clearly buoyed at finding someone alive after four
grisly days of removing bodies and crushed cars from the crumpled
concrete. They placed giant airbags, hydraulic jacks and wooden
timbers under concrete slabs and trucked in dirt to firm the
foundation. They also installed seismic monitors on the structure.
   Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Army Corps of Engineers</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Sunday</DATE> reported
major cracks in three dams within five miles of the epicenter in
the <LOCATION>Santa Cruz Mountains</LOCATION>, but said they posed ``no public threat at
this time'' because water is low behind them.
   A half-dozen tent cities have sprouted in <LOCATION>Watsonville</LOCATION>, a city of
30,000 about 80 miles south of <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>. Many residents were
so frightened by the quake and its aftershocks that they refuse to
go indoors, even if their homes have been declared safe.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Red Cross</ORGANIZATION> even opened a full-blown shelter of olive-green
military tents, complete with medical and feeding facilities, in
the battered community.
   Resumption of the World Series, the first ever between the two
Bay area teams, was pushed back until <DATE>Friday</DATE>. It had been hoped
play would resume three days earlier.
   Football was played <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, but not in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>. The 49ers
beat the <ORGANIZATION>New England Patriots 37-20</ORGANIZATION> in a game moved from
<LOCATION>Candlestick Park</LOCATION> to <ORGANIZATION>Stanford University</ORGANIZATION>, and a collection was taken
among the 75,000 fans for earthquake victims. A moment of silence
honored the dead.
   Throughout the region, <DATE>Sunday</DATE> was a time for mourning the dead
and giving thanks for survival.
   ``We pray to be spared from further suffering,'' Archbishop <PERSON>John
Quinn</PERSON> told 700 worshipers at <ORGANIZATION>St. Mary's Cathedral</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>.
``I pray for the relief of suffering and anxiety. I cannot forget
to pray for the dead and the bereaved.''
   In <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION>, parishioners of the <ORGANIZATION>St. Francis de Sales Cathedral</ORGANIZATION>
held services in a Baptist church because their tower had been
cracked and leaned precariously.
   ``Sometimes in life, God shakes us and says, `Pay attention,
there is something more important than the ordinary things in our
lives,'' the Rev. <PERSON>Joseph Powers</PERSON> said.

<LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> residents <TIME>last night</TIME> feared further damage to their homes as
after-shocks hit the city following a severe earthquake that left at least
24 people dead.
Emergency shelters quickly filled up and thousands of people were evacuated
from damaged homes in the <LOCATION>San Fernando Valley</LOCATION>, a suburban expanse of about
3m inhabitants. Seismic experts warned of a 1 in 4 chance of another big
earthquake in coming days.
President <PERSON>Bill Clinton</PERSON> declared southern <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> a federal disaster area,
paving the way for low-interest loans and emergency funds, after yesterday's
quake which measured 6.6 on the Richter scale and badly disrupted transport
and communications. About 100 fires broke out around the city as gas pipes
ruptured while 1m people were left without power.
In the suburban town of <LOCATION>Northridge</LOCATION>, the epicentre of the quake north-west of
central <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, emergency workers pulled 14 bodies out of a
three-storey block of flats that partly caved in. 'It was like a bomb going
off,' said a third-floor resident who escaped over a balcony. 'One big jolt,
it lifted the building up off its foundation, pulled it over and slammed it
down within a three-second period.'
People were also feared trapped inside a collapsed multi-storey car park at
<ORGANIZATION>Northridge</ORGANIZATION>'s shopping centre. Officials said a streetsweeper was still alive
even though tons of rubble had fallen on his vehicle.
In <LOCATION>Sylmar</LOCATION> in the <LOCATION>San Fernando</LOCATION> valley aerial television photographs showed
whole streets in flames. Residents of a <LOCATION>Sylmar</LOCATION> mobile-home park huddled
together, sobbing and embracing each other, as they watched their trailer
homes go up in flames. Dozens of cars lining the streets exploded from the
intense heat of gas fires.
Reports said that 50 buildings in <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> were also destroyed and the
quake caused many houses to slide off their foundations. Up to 1,000
buildings in the city were damaged, including two hospitals, which have been
closed. Other hospitals said they were 'inundated with walking wounded' and
officials said transport conditions were 'horrendous'.
The earthquake, which was felt 300 miles away in <LOCATION>Las Vegas</LOCATION>, struck at 4.31am
<ORGANIZATION>Pacific Standard Time</ORGANIZATION>, according to the <ORGANIZATION>US Geological Service</ORGANIZATION>. Had it struck
two hours later, in the rush hour, fatalities would probably have been much
higher, officials said. Yesterday's <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King</ORGANIZATION> holiday also meant
that many businesses were closed.
Among the dead was a motorcycle policeman thrown off a highway when the
quake split the road in two. Several raised freeways to the north and west
of the city collapsed. The <LOCATION>Santa Monica</LOCATION> freeway, the busiest in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>, was
severely damaged.
Most of the main arteries to and through the <LOCATION>San Fernando Valley</LOCATION> were badly
damaged. The entire area was without water.
The stark pictures of the pancaked roadways in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>'s second
biggest city, are reminiscent of the <DATE>1989</DATE> San Francisco earthquake, which
registered 7.1 on the Richter scale, and in which more than 50 people died.
Repairs and reinforcements to <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>'s freeway system are not
expected to be completed for another two years.
The city's airports, which were closed immediately after the earthquake,
reopened by mid-morning. However, delays were exacerbated by more than 200
after-shocks, including four measuring over 5 on the Richter scale.
Telephone services to the <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> area were yesterday limited to
emergency calls and 1,500 national guards were deployed to assist emergency
workers, amid reports of looting.
