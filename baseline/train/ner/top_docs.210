   <PERSON>Susan Butcher</PERSON> left the competition behind on
the icy <LOCATION>Bering Sea Coast</LOCATION> and mushed through bone-chilling winds
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE> to claim her third straight victory in the 1,150-mile
Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race.
   Butcher, 33, collected a <MONEY>$30,000</MONEY> first prize by urging her
nine-dog team into the finish chute at <TIME>8:42 p.m.</TIME>, hours ahead of
her closest rival in the 16th annual Anchorage-to-Nome trek. She
had been on the trail for more than 11 days.
   ``I'm just amazed at what my dogs are doing, and what they've
done all year,'' said <PERSON>Butcher</PERSON>.
   Butcher said she would try next year for a fourth straight win.
``I very much want four, I guess I want five,'' she said.
   Hundreds of cheering fans braved the blustery 15-degree weather
to watch as Butcher became the first musher to win three
consecutive <LOCATION>Iditarods</LOCATION>. Butcher started the race with 17 dogs, but
dropped eight at checkpoints along the trail.
   ``I'm really happy,'' said <PERSON>Butcher</PERSON>'s husband, <PERSON>Dave Monson</PERSON>, who
earlier this month won another long-distance <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION> sled dog race,
the 1,000-mile Yukon Quest. The couple run a kennel in the interior
<LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION> village of <ORGANIZATION>Manley</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``We've had a tremendous year,'' <PERSON>Monson</PERSON> said. ``It shows that
hard work pays off sometimes.''
   Butcher's closest competitor, <ORGANIZATION>Martin Buser of Big Lake</ORGANIZATION>, was
trailing by at least 14 hours <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>. Butcher's longtime rival,
four-time Iditarod champion <PERSON>Rick Swenson</PERSON> of Two <PERSON>Rivers</PERSON>, was minutes
behind Buser for third place.
   <PERSON>Joe Garnie</PERSON> of Teller was running fourth, and 70-year-old <PERSON>Joe
Redington</PERSON> of Knik, who organized the first Iditarod in <DATE>1973</DATE> but has
never won the race, was fifth.
   Butcher had slept little since <DATE>Monday</DATE>, when she reached the
<LOCATION>Bering Sea</LOCATION> coast in <LOCATION>Unalakleet</LOCATION>, 229 miles from <LOCATION>Nome</LOCATION>. She said a
training run last month along the windy coast accustomed her team
to the punishing conditions.
   <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>, Butcher guided her team through subzero
temperatures and winds that brought the wind chill factor down to
minus 70 degrees. Peeking out from a fur-ruffed parka, Butcher
suffered only a frost-nipped wrist.
   ``The wind was going right into my big mitt and up my arm. It's
still pretty sore,'' she said <DATE>earlier Wednesday</DATE>.
   One of Butcher's lead dogs this year was Granite, a husky that
led her to victory last year.
   Butcher, competing in her 11th Iditarod, long dreamed of being
the first woman musher to win, but that honor went to <ORGANIZATION>Libby Riddles
of Teller</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1985</DATE>. Butcher won in <DATE>1986</DATE> and <DATE>1987</DATE>, setting course
records each time.
   Last year, when the race followed its shorter southern route,
Butcher finished in 11 days, 2 hours.
   The Iditarod, named after an old supply route to the gold mining
districts of interior <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION>, draws its inspiration from a <DATE>1925</DATE>
relay of diphtheria serum to <LOCATION>Nome</LOCATION>, which was hit hard by an
outbreak of the disease.
   The race started <DATE>March 5</DATE> on trucked-in snow. The temperature in
downtown <LOCATION>Anchorage</LOCATION> hovered around 32 degrees and climbed even
higher during the next few days, which strained the cold-loving
huskies.
   Fresh snow slowed the leaders as they climbed into the <ORGANIZATION>Alaska
Range</ORGANIZATION>. That gave an advantage to <LOCATION>Redington</LOCATION>, who had taken his
mandatory 24-hour layover early in the race and sailed past the
leaders on the trail they had packed down.
   Redington, known as the Father of the Iditarod, has entered all
but two of the race's 16 runnings and has placed as high as fifth.
For 400 miles, it seemed as if he might finally win, but he lost
the lead to <PERSON>Buser</PERSON> on the <LOCATION>Yukon River</LOCATION>.
   Butcher quickly caught up, passing Buser on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> near <LOCATION>Koyuk</LOCATION>,
171 miles from the finish.
   Five of the 52 teams that started the race have dropped out.

   Musher <PERSON>Susan Butcher</PERSON> crossed the finish line
today to claim her fourth victory in the last five years in the
1,158-mile Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race.
   Her victory, in record time, turned the tables on defending
champion <PERSON>Joe Runyan</PERSON>, who edged her last year at the finish of the
Anchorage-to-Nome race. Runyan trailed Butcher on the trail by more
than an hour.
   ``She just had a better plan,'' said <PERSON>Libby Riddles</PERSON>, the first
woman to win the race in <DATE>1985</DATE>, watching the finish on the sunny
streets of this Gold Rush-era town. ``She outraced these guys. She
maintained her dog team better.
   ``It's an incredible unbelievable high,'' <PERSON>Riddles</PERSON> said. ``You go
thorugh all those ups and downs on the way to <LOCATION>Nome</LOCATION>. You can't
believe you've done it till you get there.''
   Smiling as she ran beside her dogs in her bright red snowsuit,
the 33-year-old Butcher finished the race shortly before <TIME>11 a.m.</TIME>
Her official time was 11 days, 1 hour, 53 minutes, 23 seconds,
beating both her record for the route taken this year and her
overall record for all Iditarod races.
   Earlier, following a mandatory six-hour rest, Butcher left the
<LOCATION>White Mountain</LOCATION> checkpoint 77 miles from the finish one hour 20
minutes ahead of <PERSON>Runyan</PERSON>.
   She stopped for only three minutes at Safety to move a few dogs
to different positiions in the harness before striking out on the
last 22-mile leg of the race at <TIME>8:36 a.m. AST</TIME>.
   ``It's <PERSON>Runyan</PERSON> who I have to worry about,'' <PERSON>Butcher</PERSON> said while
still on the trail. ``He has a hot team, but he's got to get ahead
of me.''
   Butcher had dropped another dog at <LOCATION>Elim</LOCATION>, leaving her with 11
dogs to <PERSON>Runyan</PERSON>'s 15 over the last 123 miles of the race.
   Butcher's time handily broke the speed record for the identical
route in <DATE>1986</DATE> _ 11 days, 15 hours and six minutes. Her <DATE>1987</DATE>
Iditarod record of 11 days 2 hours 5 minutes was set on an
alternate route.
   Anticipating today's finish, Iditarod organizers spent <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>
hanging traditional trail's end banners and setting up the racers'
chute on Front Street in <LOCATION>Nome</LOCATION>.
   Lavon Barve reached <LOCATION>White Mountain</LOCATION> in third place.
   Four-time winner <PERSON>Rick Swenson</PERSON> was reported out of the checkpoint
at <ORGANIZATION>Elim</ORGANIZATION>, while <PERSON>Tim Osmar</PERSON>, <PERSON>Robin Jacobson</PERSON> and <PERSON>DeeDee Jonrowe</PERSON> were at
the checkpoint 123 miles from the finish.
   The leaders have switched to lightweight sprint sleds, instead
of the heavier long-distance sleds they began the race with at
<LOCATION>Anchorage</LOCATION> on <DATE>March 3</DATE>.
   First prize is <MONEY>$50,000</MONEY>, with the rest of the <MONEY>$200,000</MONEY> purse
divided among the next 19 finishers.
   Teams bucked a stiff sidewind across the ice pack <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>
and drove through near whiteout conditions that are common on the
Sound.
   Butcher had expressed hopes of finishing in under 11 days.
   ``I'll have to see how this team responds going over <LOCATION>White
Mountain</LOCATION> before I go for the all-time record,'' she had said
earlier.
   Named for an abandoned gold-mining town along the trail, the
Iditarod was started in <DATE>1973</DATE> to commemorate the <DATE>1925</DATE> emergency
delivery of life-saving diphtheria serum from <LOCATION>Anchorage</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Nome</LOCATION> by
sled dog teams running in relays.
   Of the 70 teams that began the race, seven mushers have
scratched and another was disqualified because of sick dogs.

   Three-time winner <PERSON>Susan Butcher</PERSON> and
defending champion <PERSON>Joe Runyan</PERSON>, their dog teams well rested, gained
on Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race leader <PERSON>Lavon Barve</PERSON> today as they
pulled into this checkpoint on <ORGANIZATION>Norton Sound</ORGANIZATION>.
   Resting his dogs only 3{ hours, <PERSON>Barve</PERSON> was about four hours ahead
of Butcher and <PERSON>Runyan</PERSON> when they left <LOCATION>Kaltag</LOCATION>, the last checkpoint on
the <LOCATION>Yukon River</LOCATION>, for the 90-mile run to <LOCATION>Unalakleet</LOCATION>, the gateway to
the <LOCATION>Bering Sea</LOCATION>.
   Butcher, with eight hours rest, and <PERSON>Runyan</PERSON> with five, were both
<DATE>less than two hours behind Barve</DATE> when they hit <LOCATION>Unalakleet</LOCATION>, where
racers were expected to rest about six hours before heading up the
coast for the last 170 miles to <LOCATION>Nome</LOCATION>.
   Leaving <LOCATION>Kaltag</LOCATION> behind <PERSON>Runyan</PERSON> were <PERSON>Tim Osmar</PERSON>, four-time champion
<PERSON>Rick Swenson</PERSON>, <PERSON>DeeDee Jonrowe</PERSON> and <PERSON>Robin Jackobson</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Squaw Lake</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Minn</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Runyan</PERSON> said any one of the first five racers could win the race
in the last 170-mile sprint to <LOCATION>Nome</LOCATION>.
   ``If you want to make a good bet, never bet on a dog race,'' he
said. ``It's really shaken out which team is healthy and really
fit. Looks to me like it's anybody's bet what's going on here.''
   Before leaving <LOCATION>Kaltag</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Runyan</PERSON> said the leaders in the 18th
running of the 1,158-mile race had come under the spell of what he
called the ``crazy syndrome.''
   ``Everybody's pushing pushing pushing,'' <PERSON>Runyan</PERSON> said.
   Runyan called his dogs ``little bio-mechanisms'' that have to be
understood, cared for and appreciated. ``The trick is to be
predictable for the dogs,'' said <PERSON>Runyan</PERSON>.
   Because of his habit of running behind his sled rather than
riding its rails when it heads up hills, <LOCATION>Kaltag</LOCATION> area residents have
begun calling him ``Runnin' <PERSON>Runyan</PERSON>.''
   Butcher said it was wrong to assume she was leading the race
from <LOCATION>Anchorage</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Nome</LOCATION> just because she had been first to reach
<LOCATION>Kaltag</LOCATION>. She said everybody was running their own race with
different strategies.
   Named for an abandoned gold-mining town along the trail, the
Iditarod race was started in <DATE>1973</DATE> to commemorate the <DATE>1925</DATE> emergency
delivery of life-saving diphtheria serum from <LOCATION>Anchorage</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Nome</LOCATION> by
sled dog teams.
   Retired Col. <PERSON>Norman Vaughan</PERSON>, at 84 the oldest musher, was
reported in 63rd place in <LOCATION>McGrath</LOCATION>, 389 miles into the race. <PERSON>Vaughan</PERSON>
was a member of Admiral <PERSON>Byrd</PERSON>'s Antarctic expedition and competed at
the <LOCATION>Lake Placid</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION> Olympics in <DATE>1932</DATE>.

   <PERSON>Lavon Barve</PERSON> clung to the lead <DATE>Monday</DATE>
as front-runners in the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race began their
run up the <LOCATION>Bering Sea</LOCATION> coast to <LOCATION>Nome</LOCATION>.
   Barve of <LOCATION>Wasilla</LOCATION> arrived at <TIME>4:02 p.m.</TIME> in this windswept coastal
community, the final checkpoint before mushers head across the
treacherous ice of <LOCATION>Norton Bay</LOCATION>.
   ``Once they get onto the ice, they can expect sudden storms and
an ample supply of wind,'' said <PERSON>Gail Somerville</PERSON>, an Iditarod
spokeswoman in <LOCATION>Anchorage</LOCATION>.
   Three-time winner <PERSON>Susan Butcher</PERSON> of <PERSON>Manley</PERSON> and defending champion
<PERSON>Joe Runyan</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Nenana</LOCATION> were trailing Barve by just a couple of hours,
<LOCATION>Somerville</LOCATION> said.
   ``They haven't checked in yet, but they're not too far behind,''
she said.
   <PERSON>Tim Osmar</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Clam Gulch</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Dee Dee Jonrowe</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Willow</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Rick
Swenson</PERSON> of Two <PERSON>Rivers</PERSON>, the Iditarod's only four-time champion, had
reached <LOCATION>Unalakleet</LOCATION>, the largest community on the trail between
<LOCATION>Eagle River</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Nome</LOCATION>.
   Barve, driving 14 dogs, was first out of Unakleet at <TIME>10:05 a.m.</TIME>
But 50 miles earlier, at <LOCATION>Kaltag</LOCATION>, he rested his team only 3{ hours,
compared with eight hours for Butcher and five hours for <PERSON>Runyan</PERSON>.
   He didn't seem to think that was much of a handicap, however.
   ``My dogs are getting stronger with less rest,'' <PERSON>Barve</PERSON> said. ``I
think that's my advantage. My dogs always seem to recover fast.''
   Butcher, whose team had dropped to 12 dogs, said she would like
to be in front by the time the leaders reach White Mountain, just
77 miles from the finish of the 1,158-mile race.
   ``Unfortunately, that's not up to me as much as the other
guys,'' <PERSON>Butcher</PERSON> said. ``I'd like to shed them early but I don't
know if that's possible.
   ``And probably from what I know of <LOCATION>Lavon</LOCATION>'s competitive spirit
and how he can do what he wants to do with that team, I may not
shed them at all.''
   <PERSON>Runyan</PERSON> said any one of the first five mushers could win the race
in the last 170-mile sprint to <LOCATION>Nome</LOCATION>.
   ``If you want to make a good bet, never bet on a dog race,'' he
said. ``It's really shaken out to which team is healthy and really

   Before leaving <LOCATION>Kaltag</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Runyan</PERSON> said the leaders in the 18th

   ``Everybody's pushing, pushing, pushing,'' he said.
   Since 70 teams left <LOCATION>Anchorage</LOCATION> on <DATE>March 3</DATE>, seven mushers have
scratched and another has been disqualified because of sick dogs.
   The Iditarod, named for an abandoned gold-mining town along the

   Three-time <ORGANIZATION>Iditarod Trail</ORGANIZATION> Sled Dog Race
champion <PERSON>Susan Butcher</PERSON> pressed for the lead in the Anchorage-to-Nome
race <DATE>early today</DATE> as a mob of rested mushers sprinted for this
<LOCATION>Kuskokwim River</LOCATION> community.
   Butcher pulled out of <LOCATION>Nikolai</LOCATION> <DATE>early today</DATE> and was expected in
<ORGANIZATION>McGrath</ORGANIZATION>, 407 miles into the 1,168-mile race, at midmorning. She was
followed by <ORGANIZATION>Martin Buser</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>Joe Runyan</PERSON> was the first musher to reach McGrath <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>
<TIME>afternoon</TIME>, but he hadn't taken his mandatory 24-hour rest.
   To complete the layover requirement, he could not leave town
until <TIME>4:43 p.m.</TIME> <DATE>today</DATE>. Butcher took her 24-hour layover in <PERSON>Rohn</PERSON> and
could leave <PERSON>Runyan</PERSON> behind. The next 18 mushers behind Butcher also
have completed their layover.
   Butcher said she believed the frantic pace <PERSON>Runyan</PERSON> set had sapped
his dogs. ``It took him 15 hours to cross the (Farewell) Burn,'' she
said. ``It took me only 10.''
   Butcher blitzed into <PERSON>Nikolai</PERSON>, 359 miles into the race, just
before <TIME>midnight</TIME> <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>. Buser, four-time Iditarod champion <PERSON>Rick
Swenson</PERSON>, <PERSON>DeeDee Jonrow</PERSON>, <PERSON>Joe Redington</PERSON> and <PERSON>Joe Garnie</PERSON> pulled in
behind her within minutes.
   From <PERSON>McGrath</PERSON>, 761 miles remain in the race.
   Most of the 46 mushers remaining in the race were into or beyond
<PERSON>Rohn</PERSON>, 266 miles into the race.
   <PERSON>Runyan</PERSON> said he was running his own race and was trying not to
dwell on the progress of his competitors.
   ``I scratched last year,'' he said. ``Big psychological blow.''
   ``This year I looked at it, laid out a plan that I figured was
feasible. If that puts me in the money, great. If it doesn't, well
I'm gonna have a good trip.''
   Mushers are vying for a <MONEY>$250,000</MONEY> purse, with <MONEY>$50,000</MONEY> going to the
winner. Forty-nine mushers left the Iditarod starting line <DATE>Saturday</DATE>
in <LOCATION>Anchorage</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Norman Vaughan</PERSON>, <PERSON>Roger Roberts</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jan Masek</PERSON>, all
Alaskans, have dropped out.

<HEAD>Dogs and Mushers Set to Start Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Seventy dog teams and mushers were set
to start the ``Last Great Race on Earth'' on <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, the grueling
1,100-mile-long Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race from <LOCATION>Anchorage</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Nome</LOCATION>.
   Teams were expected to encounter some of the harshest weather in
the race's 18-year history, said Race Manager <PERSON>Jack Niggemyer</PERSON>.
   Sub-zero temperatures accompanied by strong winds, the heaviest
snowfall in a quarter-century, ash from Redoubt Volcano and
starving, aggressive moose have combined to make it a tough year to
race and a tough year to train, he said.
   ``Awful weather,'' <PERSON>Niggemyer</PERSON> said. ``It's probably snowed 40
inches in the <DATE>last two days</DATE>.''
   The race usually lasts from 11 to 18 days. The record time, set
by <PERSON>Susan Butcher</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Manley</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION>, in <DATE>1987</DATE>, is 11 days, two hours
and five minutes. Butcher won the race in <DATE>1986</DATE>, <DATE>1987</DATE> and <DATE>1988</DATE>.
   Some participants and race observers said they expect this
year's race to be slow going because of the deep snow and
poorly-packed trail.
   ``We might run out of trail,'' said <PERSON>Lavon Barve</PERSON>, a musher from
<LOCATION>Wasilla</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION>. ``It's up to the mushers to snowshoe or
whatever,'' he said. It will be Barve's ninth race; he finished
fifth last year.
   The Iditarod began in <DATE>1973</DATE>. It commemorates the <DATE>1925</DATE> emergency
delivery of diphtheria serum to <LOCATION>Nome</LOCATION> on the <LOCATION>Bering Sea</LOCATION>. The serum,
taken overland by sled dog because airplanes couldn't get through,
was credited with saving hundreds of lives in the remote coastal
town.
   The trail begins in <LOCATION>Anchorage</LOCATION> and heads northwest across the
giant <ORGANIZATION>Alaska Range</ORGANIZATION> and onto the treeless tundra. Eventually it
winds along the <LOCATION>Yukon River</LOCATION> to the <LOCATION>Bering Sea</LOCATION>.
   Since <DATE>1973</DATE>, the Iditarod has grown in fame and stature. This
year, mushers have come from as far as <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Switzerland</LOCATION>.
Companies spend <MONEY>tens of thousands of dollars</MONEY> to sponsor top
competitors.
   <PERSON>Rick Swenson</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Two Rivers</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION>, the only person to win the
Iditarod four times, will be trying for a fifth win. Butcher will
attempt to equal <PERSON>Swenson</PERSON>'s four-time win record.

<TEXT>
   Four-time Iditarod champion <PERSON>Rick Swenson</PERSON>
was the first sled-dog racer to reach the highest checkpoint in the
grueling race as leading mushers made their way through the rugged
<ORGANIZATION>Alaska Range</ORGANIZATION> early today.
   <PERSON>Swenson</PERSON>, driving 18 dogs through the darkness, arrived at <ORGANIZATION>Rainy
Pass</ORGANIZATION> checkpoint at <TIME>5 a.m</TIME>. He was followed four minutes later by <PERSON>Joe
Runyan</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Nenana</LOCATION>. Three-time champion <PERSON>Susan Butcher</PERSON> arrived at <TIME>5:22</TIME>,
and <PERSON>DeeDee Jonrow</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Bethel</LOCATION> arrived four minutes later.
   The weather plagued mushers early today. In some spots, wind had
blown the trail clean of snow and the ice underneath was wearing the
dogs' feet.
   None of the four leaders has taken the 24-hour layover required
during the race.
   Three other mushers were on the trail from Finger Lake to Rainy
Pass, which is 226 miles into the race and at 3,400 feet elevation.
   <PERSON>Martin Buser</PERSON>, who was out front when the first mushers pulled
into Finger Lake late <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, declared his 24-hour layover and had
not moved by early today.
   Under the rules of the race, mushers are required to make a
24-hour stop at one of the race's 24 checkpoints; at the others,
they take whatever length of rest they believe they and the dogs
need. However, mushers are allowed to use the strategy of declaring
a 24-hour layover, then leaving after a couple of hours, in hopes of
getting a jump on their competitors.
   The 1,168-mile race began <DATE>Saturday</DATE> when 49 mushers left <LOCATION>Anchorage</LOCATION>
amid 46 mph gusts and a wind-chill reading of 22 degrees below zero.
Two mushers, <PERSON>Roger Roberts</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jan Masek</PERSON>, dropped out 151 miles into
the race.
   From Rainy Pass, the mushers have 942 miles to go before reaching
the finish on <LOCATION>Nome</LOCATION>'s historic Front Street.
   The trail out of <ORGANIZATION>Rainy Pass</ORGANIZATION> contains dangerous dogleg descents on
icy trails clinging to steep embankments.
   Several mushers complained that parts of trail were difficult to
navigate. <PERSON>Reddington</PERSON> said getting over a bluff past the <LOCATION>Yentna River</LOCATION>
was virtually impossible.
   ``You need an elevator to get over that one,'' said <PERSON>Reddington</PERSON>,
who injured his two rear dogs <DATE>Sunday</DATE> when his sled crashed into them
and opted to take a 24-hour layover at <ORGANIZATION>Finger Lake</ORGANIZATION>.
   Inspired by a sled-dog relay of serum to <LOCATION>Nome</LOCATION> for a diphtheria
outbreak in <DATE>1925</DATE>, the Iditarod was founded in <DATE>1973</DATE>. The winner this
year is to get <MONEY>$50,000</MONEY> of the <MONEY>$250,000</MONEY> purse. The remainder is
shared by the next 19 finishers.
   Most of the Iditarod mushers are from <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION>. Others are from
<LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>.

   Declaring that she must ``do everything
right from here on in,'' <PERSON>Susan Butcher</PERSON> prepared to leave here late
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME> in her quest for a fourth consecutive victory in
the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race.
   Butcher reached <PERSON>McGrath</PERSON>, 407 miles into the race, at <TIME>8:17 a.m.</TIME>
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, about 15{ hours after <PERSON>Joe Runyan</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Nenana</LOCATION> became the
first musher to arrive in the <LOCATION>Kuskokwim River</LOCATION> community.
   Butcher was followed by four-time Iditarod winner <PERSON>Rick Swenson</PERSON> in
the No.3 position at <TIME>10:05 a.m.</TIME> Dee <PERSON>Dee Jonrowe</PERSON> and <PERSON>Martin Buser</PERSON>
completed the top five, arriving in <ORGANIZATION>McGrath</ORGANIZATION> at <TIME>10:11 a.m. and 11:03
a.m.</TIME>, respectively. Another 10 mushers in the field of 45 pulled
into <ORGANIZATION>McGrath</ORGANIZATION> by <TIME>late afternoon</TIME>.
   <PERSON>Runyan</PERSON> said he would stay in the village for the 24-hour layover
required in the course of the 1,168-mile race from <LOCATION>Anchorage</LOCATION> to
<LOCATION>Nome</LOCATION>. Completing the layover meant <PERSON>Runyan</PERSON> was unable to leave
<PERSON>McGrath</PERSON> before <TIME>4:43 p.m.</TIME> <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
   Twelve of the mushers still in the race <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> had not taken
their layovers. Many, including Butcher, completed them at <ORGANIZATION>Rohn</ORGANIZATION>.
   Butcher said the number of teams leading among the 45 still in
the race hadn't thinned as much as she expected. She also said she
believed the frantic pace <PERSON>Runyan</PERSON> set had sapped his dogs.
   ``It took him 15 hours to cross the (Farewell) Burn,'' she said.
``It took me only 10.''
   Forty-nine mushers left the Iditarod starting line <DATE>Saturday</DATE> in
<LOCATION>Anchorage</LOCATION>. Three dropped out relatively early in the race and a
fourth, <PERSON>David Aisenbrey</PERSON>, added his name to the scratch list
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE>. Officials at the Iditarod headquarters in <LOCATION>Anchorage</LOCATION> said
they did not know the reason for <ORGANIZATION>Aisenbrey</ORGANIZATION>'s withdrawal.
   The annual Iditarod began 17 years ago and was inspired by a <DATE>1925</DATE>
relay of serum to <LOCATION>Nome</LOCATION> during a diphtheria outbreak. The race, which
carries a <MONEY>$250,000</MONEY> purse, is put on largely by volunteers.
   Gov. <PERSON>Steve Cowper</PERSON> has been among them, but he said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> that
he no longer has the time to offer his services. Nonetheless, he
made it to <PERSON>Nikolai</PERSON>, the checkpoint before <PERSON>McGrath</PERSON>, to see some of
the activity.
   ``A lot of the mushers are pretty good friends of mine from way
back,'' <PERSON>Cowper</PERSON> said. ``I love this race and I'd do anything I can to
promote it.''
   The governor said musher and Iditarod founder <PERSON>Joe Redington</PERSON>, No.
14 in the rankings <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME>, has offered to provide him
with a dog team if he wants to compete some year.
   ``That may be a little ways down the trail, as they say,'' said
<PERSON>Cowper</PERSON>, who is serving his first term. ``It probably won't work
until I leave my present employment.''

   <PERSON>Joe Redington</PERSON> stole the lead of the
1,150-mile Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> as he and <PERSON>Herbie
Nayokpuk</PERSON> sailed past other mushers who had packed down a smooth,
fast trail for them.
   Redington, a <LOCATION>Wasilla</LOCATION> resident who is a founder of the
16-year-old race, and <ORGANIZATION>Nayokpuk</ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION>Shishmaref</LOCATION>, took their mandatory
24-hour layovers on <DATE>Sunday</DATE>. The race leaders passed them by, only
to get bogged down in freshly fallen snow as they crossed the
<ORGANIZATION>Alaska Range</ORGANIZATION>.
   The leading mushers then took their mandatory layovers at <ORGANIZATION>Rohn</ORGANIZATION>,
271 miles from the race's start in <LOCATION>Anchorage</LOCATION>. They watched
helplessly as <LOCATION>Redington</LOCATION> and Nayokpuk _ and <TIME>less than two hours
later</TIME>, <PERSON>Joe Garnie</PERSON> of Teller _ powered past them.
   ``I kind of have this feeling in the back of my mind that we're
going to see two Eskimos _ Garnie and Nayokpuk _ blazing across
this state,'' said <PERSON>Jerry Austin</PERSON>, one of the mushers taking a
layover at <ORGANIZATION>Rohn</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>Joe Runyan</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Nenana</LOCATION> was the first musher to leave <PERSON>Rohn</PERSON>, at
<TIME>10:30 p.m.</TIME> <DATE>Monday</DATE>. But he has not declared his 24-hour layover, and
so is behind <LOCATION>Redington</LOCATION>, who left Rohn at <TIME>7:20 a.m.</TIME> <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
Nayokpuk left <PERSON>Rohn</PERSON> two minutes behind <LOCATION>Redington</LOCATION>. Garnie left at <TIME>9
a.m.</TIME>
   Still at <ORGANIZATION>Rohn</ORGANIZATION>, in the order in which they arrived, were: <PERSON>Jan
Masek</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Anchorage</LOCATION>; <PERSON>Lavon Barve</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Wasilla</LOCATION>; defending champion
<PERSON>Susan Butcher</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Manley</LOCATION>; <LOCATION>Jacques Philip of Thomery</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>; <LOCATION>Austin</LOCATION>,
of <LOCATION>St. Michael</LOCATION>; <PERSON>Tim Moerlein</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Kasilof</LOCATION>; and, in 11th place,
two-time Iditarod champion <PERSON>Rick Swenson</PERSON>.
   From <PERSON>Rohn</PERSON>, the teams descend from the heights of the <ORGANIZATION>Alaska
Range</ORGANIZATION> into the timbered interior of the state for the longest
stretch between checkpoints in the race. Mushers must contend with
a bleak and treacherous area known as Farewell Burn before reaching
the next checkpoint, 93 miles away at <LOCATION>Nikolai</LOCATION>.
   The race is inspired by a <DATE>1925</DATE> dog sled relay that rushed
diphtheria serum to <LOCATION>Nome</LOCATION> during an outbreak of the disease. The top
20 mushers will split a purse of <MONEY>$150,000</MONEY>. The winner will get
<MONEY>$30,000</MONEY>.

   Mushers in the 1,168-mile Iditarod Trail Sled
Dog Race charged along <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION>'s frozen west coast <DATE>today</DATE> in a tight
race to the finish line in this historic Gold Rush town.
   <PERSON>Joe Runyan</PERSON>, 40, of <LOCATION>Nenana</LOCATION>, led a pack of five front-runners in
the Anchorage-to-Nome trek today when he left <LOCATION>White Mountain</LOCATION>, 77
miles from the finish, with a five-minute lead over defending
champion <PERSON>Susan Butcher</PERSON>, 33, of <ORGANIZATION>Manley</ORGANIZATION>.
   Butcher, who has won the last three races, was down to 11 dogs _
several with diarrhea _ while <PERSON>Runyan</PERSON> was running 14.
   Race officials expected the winner to claim the <MONEY>$50,000</MONEY>
first-prize sometime around noon <ORGANIZATION>AST</ORGANIZATION> (4 p.m. EST).
   <PERSON>Rick Swenson</PERSON>, the only musher ever to win the race four times,
arrived in <LOCATION>White Mountain</LOCATION> an hour before <PERSON>Runyan</PERSON> left and said he had
given up hope of catching him. ``My goal now is to get it over
with,'' <PERSON>Swenson</PERSON> said.
   <PERSON>Dee Dee Jonrowe</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Willow</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Lavon Barve</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Wasilla</LOCATION> were fourth
and fifth respectively.
   Forty-one of the 49 mushers who left <LOCATION>Anchorage</LOCATION> on <DATE>March 4</DATE>
remained in the race <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>. They use up to 18 dogs.
   The annual race began 17 years ago and was inspired by a sled-dog
relay of serum to <LOCATION>Nome</LOCATION> during a <DATE>1925</DATE> diphtheria outbreak. Butcher
finished the <DATE>1988</DATE> race in just under 11 days and 12 hours to set a
record.
   As they awaited the finishers, workers in <LOCATION>Nome</LOCATION> moved snow onto
historic Front Street, normally swept clean for traffic. The first
musher to cross the finish line wins <MONEY>$50,000</MONEY> and <MONEY>$200,000</MONEY> is divided
among the next 19 finishers.
   The race, whose trail is named for the gold mining ghost town of
Iditarod at the halfway point, attracts dozens of volunteers from
around the world.
   ``I think (author) <PERSON>Jack London</PERSON> put it best _ `It's the call of
the wild,''' Iditarod volunteer <PERSON>Peter Elstub</PERSON> said. ``It's a true
sporting event.''
   Elstub, a <ORGANIZATION>British Army</ORGANIZATION> soldier, has used his annual leave for
eight years to work for the Iditarod, performing tasks ranging from
telephone duty to dropping dog food along the trail. When military
duty kept him away in <DATE>1987</DATE>, he telephoned Iditarod headquarters for
race updates.
   ``It don't matter where I am in the world,'' he said. ``I still
want me dog information.''
   Unlike some years in which weather was a major factor in the
outcome, this year's Iditarod has been blessed with almost ideal
conditions.
   Racers stop at 25 checkpoints along the route and are required to
make two extended rest stops, one for 24 hours, the other for six
hours.
   Commercial jets flying into <LOCATION>Nome</LOCATION> operated near capacity <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>
as mushers' families and other race watchers headed toward this town
of 4,300 people on <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION>'s west coast. Pilots pointed out stretches
of the trail and encouraged passengers to keep their eyes open for
sled teams.
   Nome, which looks onto the frozen <ORGANIZATION>Norton Sound</ORGANIZATION>, took on a party
atmosphere helped by sunny skies and temperatures in the 20s. Singer
<PERSON>Hobo Jim</PERSON>, known for a song with the refrain ``I did, I did, I did
the <ORGANIZATION>Iditarod Trail</ORGANIZATION>,'' entertained customers at a Front Street saloon.
   For the locals, the Iditarod days ``give people a reason to be
outside and just walk around town and see what happened all <DATE>winter</DATE>
long while they were holed up in their houses,'' said <PERSON>Mary Knodel</PERSON>, a
shopkeeper whose store overlooks the finish line.
   <PERSON>Knodel</PERSON> said she doesn't root for individual mushers.
   ``After watching the race for all these years, you get to know
most of them,'' she said. ``It's like family. You don't like picking
one over another.''
   But <PERSON>Marylou Haggren</PERSON>, of <LOCATION>Kodiak</LOCATION>, was rooting for <ORGANIZATION>Butcher</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``We just got back from the Lower 48, and down there everyone's
talking basketball,'' she said. ``Different lifestyles, I guess.''

   Four-time winner <PERSON>Rick Swenson</PERSON> regained
the lead <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> in the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race, while a
musher miles behind him was trying to scare off curious buffaloes.
   <PERSON>Lavon Barve</PERSON> and three-time champion <PERSON>Susan Butcher</PERSON> were minutes
behind <PERSON>Swenson</PERSON> about a third of the way through the 1,158-mile race
from <LOCATION>Anchorage</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Nome</LOCATION>.
   ``There's a lot of strong teams this year,'' said <PERSON>Butcher</PERSON>,
warning that there's still plenty of time for surprises. ``We've
got a long way to go yet.''
   <PERSON>Swenson</PERSON> led the race <DATE>Monday</DATE> topping the <ORGANIZATION>Alaska Range</ORGANIZATION> at
3,500-foot Rainy Pass, but was overtaken by defending champion <PERSON>Joe
Runyan</PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION>Rohn</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
   He had a cut on his face and a cracked plastic runner on his
sled as he mushed away from this Athabascan Indian village of 110
people at Iditarod milepost 367.

<DATELINE>ROHN, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fresh snow on the trail continued to slow
the pace of the 1,150-mile Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race as mushers
slogged their way down from the frosted peaks of the <ORGANIZATION>Alaska Range</ORGANIZATION>.
   On <DATE>Monday</DATE>, <PERSON>Jan Masek</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Anchorage</LOCATION> led a tightly grouped caravan
of more than 20 mushers to <PERSON>Rohn Roadhouse</PERSON>, a remote log-cabin
checkpoint 271 miles from the start in <LOCATION>Anchorage</LOCATION>.
   Masek arrived at <TIME>3:10 p.m.</TIME>, followed eight minutes later by
<PERSON>Lavon Barve</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Wasilla</LOCATION>. Defending champion <PERSON>Susan Butcher</PERSON> arrived at
<TIME>3:20 p.m.</TIME>, followed closely by <PERSON>Jerry Austin</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>St. Michael</ORGANIZATION> and
<ORGANIZATION>Jacques Philip of Thomery</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Tim Moerlein</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Kasilof</LOCATION> pulled in at <TIME>3:31 p.m.</TIME>, trailed four
minutes later by four-time Iditarod champion <PERSON>Rick Swenson</PERSON>, in
seventh position.
   By <TIME>8:30 p.m.</TIME>, half the 52 mushers in the race had made it to
<PERSON>Rohn</PERSON>. The rest were spread the 78 miles back to Finger Lake.
   Racers were slowed by up to 6 inches of new snow as they mushed
down to <PERSON>Rohn</PERSON> from Rainy Pass, at 3,400 feet the highest point along
the trail.
   Rohn is a favorite point for mushers to take the 24-hour layover
required of all mushers sometime during the Anchorage-to-Nome race.
The isolated cabin provides a refuge from spectators and reporters,
and the dogs often are tired from crossing the rugged mountains.
   The race, which started at <TIME>9 a.m.</TIME> <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, has been slower than
last year's record-setting pace, when <ORGANIZATION>Butcher</ORGANIZATION> reached <LOCATION>Nome</LOCATION> after 11
days, 2 hours on the trail.
   The race is inspired by a <DATE>1925</DATE> dog sled relay that rushed
diphtheria serum to <LOCATION>Nome</LOCATION> during an outbreak of the disease. The top
20 mushers will split a purse of <MONEY>$150,000</MONEY>. The winner will get
<MONEY>$30,000</MONEY>.

   One musher in the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog
Race and his dogs were safe today after he had to kill an attacking
moose with five pistol shots.
   Defending champion <PERSON>Joe Runyan</PERSON> held the lead today after passing
four-time winner <PERSON>Rick Swenson</PERSON> in the 1,160-mile race.
   <PERSON>Lorren Weaver</PERSON>, holding 44th place among the 68 racers still in
the race and 78 miles behind <PERSON>Runyan</PERSON>, killed a moose that attacked
his dogs on the trail between <LOCATION>Skwentna</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Finger Lake</ORGANIZATION>, race
officials said.
   Searchers had set out on snowmobiles <DATE>Monday</DATE> after two bush
pilots reported seeing the moose attack a team of dogs.
   One dog was gashed across the head, but <PERSON>Weaver</PERSON>, 50, a physician
fron Knik, and his team were otherwise unhurt. They continued into
<ORGANIZATION>Finger Lake</ORGANIZATION>, checkpoint No. 7 and 193 miles from the start of the
race from <LOCATION>Anchorage</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Nome</LOCATION> that started <DATE>Saturday</DATE>.
   Race spokeswoman <PERSON>Debbie Croutch</PERSON> said the moose was without
antlers, but there was no report on whether it was a bull or a cow.
Bulls often have dropped their racks this by time of year.
   Attacks by hungry moose plagued racers during training this
year, and some mushers carried rifles for protection. The animals,
which weigh up to 1,800 pounds, have become aggressive because deep
snow has made it hard to graze.
   Runyan and five other veteran racers overtook <PERSON>Swenson</PERSON> during the
sprint <DATE>Monday</DATE> from Rainy Pass to <PERSON>Rohn</PERSON>, 271 miles into the race. The
group passing <PERSON>Swenson</PERSON> included his archrival, <PERSON>Susan Butcher</PERSON>.
   Swenson is the only person to have won the race four times.
Butcher won in <DATE>1986</DATE>, <DATE>1987</DATE> and <DATE>1988</DATE>, and took second place last year.
   The Iditarod race runs from <LOCATION>Anchorage</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Nome</LOCATION>, on the <LOCATION>Bering Sea</LOCATION>
coast, and crosses frozen rivers, treeless tundra and huge mountain
passes. Usually the race lasts 11 to 18 days or longer, depending
on weather and other conditions.
   Seventy mushers and dog teams left <LOCATION>Anchorage</LOCATION> on <DATE>Saturday</DATE>.
   The Iditarod, named after a ghost town along the trail,
commemorates the delivery by sled dog teams of a life-saving
diphtheria serum to <LOCATION>Nome</LOCATION> in <DATE>1925</DATE>.

   Champion dog-sledder <PERSON>Susan Butcher</PERSON> told
President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> on <DATE>Friday</DATE> that she has plans for her own brand of
U.S.-Soviet detent.
   If all goes well, <PERSON>Butcher</PERSON> said, there will be a 1,000-mile dog
sled race between <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Siberia</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> welcomed Butcher and her prize sled dog, <LOCATION>Granite</LOCATION>, to the
<ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> to congratulate her on her fourth win of the annual
Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race across <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION>.
   Butcher and her team of dogs made the 1,158-mile <LOCATION>Anchorage</LOCATION> to
<LOCATION>Nome</LOCATION> run in a record 11 days, 1 hour and 53 minutes last month. She
broke her <DATE>1987</DATE> record by more than 10 minutes after braving
temperatures that dropped to 40 below zero and 100 mph winds that
ripped across the <LOCATION>Bering Sea</LOCATION>.
   Arriving at the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> in a shortsleeve spring dress while
others were bundled up in winter garb against a cold rain, Butcher
professed not to be cold, even when waiting outside while <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s
meeting with Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON>Eduard Shevardnadze</PERSON> ran long.
   ``I just finished a 440-mile race the day before yesterday in
the Arctic. It was 20 below,'' she laughingly told <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> as they
posed for photos with Granite in the Rose Garden.
   She gave <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> a photograph of the Iditarod race signed by the
top 20 finishers after the president emerged from his <ORGANIZATION>Oval Office</ORGANIZATION>
meetings to make superpower summit preparations.
   She also told him about plans for the Alaska-to-Siberia race.
The Soviets already have agreed, and the race will go 800 miles
into the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>.
   Butcher, 35, who is generally recognized as the greatest sled
dog racer in the world, told <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> she started her mushing career in
<LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION>, the president's vacation home since his boyhood. She is a
native of <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION>.
   Butcher and her husband live in a wilderness cabin, 140 miles
northwest of <ORGANIZATION>Fairbanks</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION>, with a brood of dogs that numbers
as many of 150. She breeds the dogs for other dog sled racers.
   Only one other musher, <PERSON>Rick Swenson</PERSON>, has won the Iditarod four
times.

<TEXT>
   <PERSON>Susan Butcher</PERSON>, who won the last two
Iditarod dog-sled races with <PERSON>Rick Swenson</PERSON> on her heels, chased
<PERSON>Swenson</PERSON> on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> as the two winningest mushers in race history
fought for the early lead in the 1,100-mile trek.
   <PERSON>Joe Runyan</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Nenana</LOCATION> actually was farthest along the trail early
<DATE>Tuesday</DATE>. But he had not yet taken his mandatory 24-hour rest stop,
while <PERSON>Swenson</PERSON>, Butcher and five others declared theirs at <ORGANIZATION>Rohn</ORGANIZATION>,
which is 266 miles from the start in <LOCATION>Anchorage</LOCATION> and 902 miles from
the finish line in <LOCATION>Nome</LOCATION>.
   Swenson, Butcher and <PERSON>DeeDee Jonrowe</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Willow</ORGANIZATION> were expected to
start racing about noon <ORGANIZATION>AST</ORGANIZATION> <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
   Historically, Iditarod front-runners have faded badly by the time
they reached <LOCATION>Nome</LOCATION>, more than 1,100 miles from the start.
   In past years, <PERSON>Butcher</PERSON>, who has won the last three races, and
<PERSON>Swenson</PERSON>, the only four-time winner, have been content to bide their
time, making their moves much later in the race.
   But this year <PERSON>Swenson</PERSON> and Butcher went straight to the front. He
led Butcher into Rohn by 13 minutes.
   ``It just worked out that way,'' <PERSON>Swenson</PERSON> said of their quick
start. ``The thing is there was no one else that was going to go.''
   The two intense, outspoken competitors used to be neighbors in
<LOCATION>Manley</LOCATION>, but <PERSON>Swenson</PERSON> has moved to <ORGANIZATION>Two Rivers</ORGANIZATION>. Their rivalry has grown
to epic proportions throughout the state.
   ``I think I can beat her ... but she's got a good team, and she
might beat us all,'' <PERSON>Swenson</PERSON> said. He said his team this year is
better than the one that was runner-up to Butcher last year.
   On <DATE>Monday</DATE>, three people escaped serious injury when a
single-engine airplane chartered by an <LOCATION>Anchorage</LOCATION> TV station crashed
while covering the race.
   The field of mushers dwindled to 46 <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> when 83-year-old
<PERSON>Norman Vaughan</PERSON> called it quits at <LOCATION>Skwentna</LOCATION>, just 151 miles into the
race. Two other mushers dropped out earlier at <LOCATION>Big Lake</LOCATION>, only 71
miles along the way.
   Inpired by a dog-sled relay of serum to <LOCATION>Nome</LOCATION> for a diphtheria
outbreak in <DATE>1925</DATE>, the Iditarod was founded in <DATE>1973</DATE>. The winner this
year is to get <MONEY>$50,000</MONEY> of the <MONEY>$250,000</MONEY> purse. The remainder will be
shared by the next 19 finishers.
   Most of the Iditarod mushers are from <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION>. Others are from
<LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>.

   Big Lake musher <PERSON>Martin Buser</PERSON> was first
in line and on his way to the <ORGANIZATION>Alaska Range</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Sunday</DATE> as the leaders
in the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race sorted themselves out in the
early stages of the contest.
   Forty-nine mushers streaked out of <LOCATION>Anchorage</LOCATION> on <DATE>Saturday</DATE> on the
first leg of the 1,168-mile race from <LOCATION>Anchorage</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Nome</LOCATION>.
   Buser, 30, reached the <LOCATION>Skwentna</LOCATION> checkpoint some 150 miles into
the race at <TIME>3:53 a.m. AST</TIME> <DATE>Sunday</DATE>. He and his 20-dog team were out
and on his way to Finger Lake, 45 miles farther down the trail, at
<TIME>7:44 a.m.
   Buser</TIME>, who finished third last year and paced the leaders for
much of that race, was followed out by <PERSON>Jerry Austin</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>St. Michael</ORGANIZATION>
at <TIME>9:13 a.m.</TIME> <LOCATION>Austin</LOCATION> dropped two dogs at the checkpoint, leaving with
16.
   Four-time champion <PERSON>Rick Swenson</PERSON> of Two <PERSON>Rivers</PERSON> raced out of
<LOCATION>Skwentna</LOCATION> <TIME>21 minutes later</TIME>.
   The leaders were followed by about a dozen other mushers,
including Iditarod winners <PERSON>Rick Mackey</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Trapper Creek</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Susan
Butcher</PERSON> of <PERSON>Manley</PERSON> and Libby Riddles of <LOCATION>Nome</LOCATION>.
   The race, inspired by a sled-dog relay of serum to <LOCATION>Nome</LOCATION> for a
diptheria outbreak in <DATE>1925</DATE>, began in <DATE>1973</DATE>. It has become the
nation's most famous sled-dog and commands a first prize this year
of <MONEY>$50,000</MONEY> and total prize money of <MONEY>$250,000</MONEY>.
   Wind up to 46 mph that raked mushers in the first hours of the
race abated <DATE>Sunday</DATE> and it was clear and cold.
   But race volunteer <PERSON>Bob Nobmann</PERSON> said the leaders were taking
longer that normal to reach the first checkpoint. ``We think it was
slow going between the wind and the ice, tough going,'' he said.
   From <LOCATION>Skwentna</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Buser</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Austin</LOCATION> and the others headed to Finger
Lake, a wide spot in the trail with a population of two residents.
From Finger Lake, the trail climbs into the <ORGANIZATION>Alaska Range</ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION>Rainy
Pass</ORGANIZATION>, the highest spot on the race route at 3,400 feet.
   The 17th annual race began with <LOCATION>Austin</LOCATION> first out of the chute.
Before the contest is over, mushers will trek over the <ORGANIZATION>Alaska Range</ORGANIZATION>,
across desolate expanses and along a storm-raked coastline.
   Riddles, <DATE>1985</DATE> champion and the first woman to win the marathon
race, said she thought the cold and wind <DATE>Saturday</DATE> might have been
good for dog teams, cooling them off in the early stretches where
they tend to overheat in the excitement.
   Most of the Iditarod mushers are from <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION>. Others are from
<LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>.

their dog teams passed the last checkpoint on the <LOCATION>Yukon River</LOCATION>
section of the race.
   <PERSON>Joe Redington</PERSON> pulled out of <LOCATION>Kaltag</LOCATION>, on the <LOCATION>Yukon River</LOCATION>, at <TIME>4:22
a.m.</TIME> and turned toward <LOCATION>Unalakleet</LOCATION>, 90 miles away on the wind-swept
<ORGANIZATION>Norton Sound</ORGANIZATION> coast.
   Redington had left only nine of the 15 dogs with which he began.
Race rules require mushers to arrive in <LOCATION>Nome</LOCATION> with at least five
dogs in harness.
   Leaving Kaltag 2{ hours after <LOCATION>Redington</LOCATION> was <ORGANIZATION>Martin Buser of Big
Lake</ORGANIZATION>, who had passed <LOCATION>Redington</LOCATION> early <DATE>Saturday</DATE> before falling back
into second place again <DATE>Sunday</DATE>. Buser still had 13 dogs in harness,
one fewer than <DATE>Saturday</DATE>.
   Buser had arrived in <LOCATION>Kaltag</LOCATION> only 23 minutes behind <LOCATION>Redington</LOCATION>.
The town is 798 miles from <LOCATION>Anchorage</LOCATION>, where the 1,100-mile race
began <DATE>March 5</DATE>.
   Defending champion <PERSON>Susan Butcher</PERSON>, who won the last two races in
record times, left at the tiny village at <TIME>8:18 a.m.</TIME>, and four-time
champion <PERSON>Rick Swenson</PERSON> at <TIME>9:58 a.m.</TIME>, both with 12 dogs.
   The next checkpoint is <LOCATION>Unalakleet</LOCATION>, about 90 miles away on the
coast of <ORGANIZATION>Norton Sound</ORGANIZATION>. From <LOCATION>Unalakleet</LOCATION>, the teams run north along
the coast, open to the region's sudden storms and raking winds.
   The first musher to reach <LOCATION>Nome</LOCATION> will collect <MONEY>$30,000</MONEY> of a
<MONEY>$150,000</MONEY> purse; the next 19 finishers will split the rest. Three of

<DATE>Saturday</DATE>.
   Redington, who founded the race in <DATE>1973</DATE>, has never won, although

   Redington had paced the race for more than 400 miles, before
<PERSON>Buser</PERSON> pulled out of <LOCATION>Galena</LOCATION> an hour ahead of him <DATE>Saturday</DATE>. Buser
also arrived first at the Nulato checkpoint, but then warm weather
forced both men to wait until dark before setting out for <LOCATION>Kaltag</LOCATION>.

   Cheering crowds and a blaring siren greeted
<PERSON>Joe Runyan</PERSON> on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> when he and 11 dogs pulled into this
historic gold mining town to claim the 17th annual Iditarod Trail
Sled Dog Race.
   It took the <LOCATION>Nenana</LOCATION> musher slightly more than 11 days to cover the
1,168 miles from <LOCATION>Anchorage</LOCATION>. His wife and baby watched as he won
<MONEY>$50,000</MONEY> of the <MONEY>$250,000</MONEY> purse to be shared by the first 20 finishers.
   The victory gave <PERSON>Runyan</PERSON>, 40, the ``triple crown'' in
long-distance dog mushing. Last year, he won the Alpirod, the more
sedate European version of the Iditarod, and in <DATE>1985</DATE>, he won the
1,000-mile Yukon Quest from <LOCATION>Whitehorse</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Yukon Territory</ORGANIZATION>, to
<ORGANIZATION>Fairbanks</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>Runyan</PERSON> said his dogs were in good shape after the grueling trek.
   ``We've gone over 200 miles in 24 hours,'' he said. ``The <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION>
husky is unlike any animal on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. They can go 100 miles a day on
rough terrain and they can take it.''
   Runyan snapped a three-year winning streak by <PERSON>Susan Butcher</PERSON> of
<ORGANIZATION>Manley</ORGANIZATION>, but failed by about three hours to break her <DATE>1987</DATE> record
time. When he crossed the finish line, Butcher was about five miles
behind. The only other musher to win more than one Iditarod is
four-time champion <PERSON>Rick Swenson</PERSON> of <PERSON>Two Rivers</PERSON>, who was running
fourth when <PERSON>Runyan</PERSON> finished.
   <PERSON>Runyan</PERSON>, who runs a kennel about 50 miles from <LOCATION>Fairbanks</LOCATION>, said his
main goal simply was to reach the finish first. ``I didn't care
about the record,'' he said. ``There's always room for fine-honing
(next year).''
   Butcher, who came in second an hour and four minutes behind
<PERSON>Runyan</PERSON>, had struggled to keep up after beating him by two minutes at
the race half-way point of Iditarod, for which she won <MONEY>$3,000</MONEY> in
silver ingots. Only once in race history has the halfway winner gone
on to victory.
   Illnesses among her dogs made it difficult to run a stronger
race, <PERSON>Butcher</PERSON> said at the finish line. The problems included
diarrhea and leg disorders that required her to bandage some of the
animals.
   She gave each of her 11 dogs a congratulatory pat after pulling
into the finish chute. ``I'm really proud of them,'' <PERSON>Butcher</PERSON> said.
   Runyan arrived in <LOCATION>White Mountain</LOCATION>, about 77 miles from the finish
early <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>. Swenson arrived in <LOCATION>White Mountain</LOCATION> an hour before
<PERSON>Runyan</PERSON> left, but said <PERSON>Runyan</PERSON>'s team was just too strong for him to
catch.
   ``My goal now is to get it over with,'' said <PERSON>Swenson</PERSON>, who trailed
Butcher. <PERSON>Dee Dee Jonrowe</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Willow</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Lavon Barve</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Wasilla</LOCATION> were
fourth and fifth, respectively.
   ``I'm kind of feeling sorry for how we have to run the dogs at
the end,'' <PERSON>Jonrowe</PERSON> said <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>. ``I had to drop my leader. His foot
was sore.''
   Forty-nine mushers left the starting line in <LOCATION>Anchorage</LOCATION> on <DATE>March
4</DATE>. Eight scratched along the way.
   <LOCATION>Nome</LOCATION>, the last town of any size before the <ORGANIZATION>International Date
Line</ORGANIZATION>, took on a party atmosphere <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, helped by sunny skies and
temperatures that rose to the 20s.
   Workers in <LOCATION>Nome</LOCATION>, which has 4,300 people and looks out over the
frozen <ORGANIZATION>Norton Sound</ORGANIZATION>, moved snow onto Front Sreet, normally swept
clean for traffic, in anticipation of the mushers' arrival.
   Volunteers at the Iditarod office a block away updated race
standings from reports submitted by ham radio operators along the
trail.
   ``I think (author) <PERSON>Jack London</PERSON> put it best _ `It's the call of
the wild.''' volunteer <PERSON>Peter Elstub</PERSON> said.
   Elstub, a British soldier, said he had come to <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION> for eight
of the last 17 races. In <DATE>1987</DATE>, when he was on duty in the <LOCATION>Falkland
Islands</LOCATION>, he telephoned Iditarod headquarters for race updates, he
said.
   For locals, the Iditarod days ``give people a reason to be
outside and just walk around town and see what happened all <DATE>winter</DATE>
long while they were holed up in their houses,'' said <PERSON>Mary Knodel</PERSON>, a
shopkeeper whose store overlooks the finish line.
   <PERSON>Marylou Haggren</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Kodiak</LOCATION> resident, said she and her husband made
hotel reservations a year ago for Iditarod week in <LOCATION>Nome</LOCATION>.
   ``We just got back from the Lower 48, and down there everyone's
talking basketball,'' <PERSON>Mrs. Haggren</PERSON> said as she lingered in the
Iditarod office. ``Different lifestyles, I guess.''

   A 70-year-old man known as the ``Father
of the Iditarod' pocketed <MONEY>$2,500</MONEY> in silver ingots today for being
the first to reach the half-way point of the 1,100-mile Iditarod
Trail Sled Dog Race.
   <PERSON>Joe Redington</PERSON> of Knik reached the Cripple checkpoint at <TIME>5:40
a.m.</TIME> His nearest competitor, <PERSON>Herbie Nayokpuk</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Shishmaref</LOCATION>, checked
into <PERSON>Ophir</PERSON>, 55 miles behind <LOCATION>Redington</LOCATION>, at <TIME>11:10 p.m.</TIME> <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
   Redington, a founder of the mushing marathon from <LOCATION>Anchorage</LOCATION> to
<LOCATION>Nome</LOCATION>, now heads for the <ORGANIZATION>Sulatna Crossing</ORGANIZATION> and then to <LOCATION>Ruby</LOCATION> on the
<LOCATION>Yukon River</LOCATION>. He has raced in all but two of the 16 <LOCATION>Iditarods</LOCATION>,
finishing three times in fifth place.
   Four-time champion <PERSON>Rick Swenson</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Two Rivers</ORGANIZATION> was running third.
He checked out of <LOCATION>Takotna</LOCATION> at <TIME>8:37 p.m.</TIME> <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>. He was followed
by <PERSON>Joe Garnie</PERSON> of Teller, <PERSON>Jan Masek</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Anchorage</LOCATION> and <PERSON>DeeDee Jonrowe</PERSON>
of <LOCATION>Bethel</LOCATION>.
   Defending champion <PERSON>Susan Butcher</PERSON> of <PERSON>Manley</PERSON> was seventh.
   Several racers said that despite <LOCATION>Redington</LOCATION>'s lead, <PERSON>Nayokpuk</PERSON> is
now the musher to beat because of his strong dog team.
   ``I think it's going to take us quite a while to gain that kind
of time back, unless he runs into some kind of situation up
ahead,'' <PERSON>Swenson</PERSON> said.
   A blizzard pounding <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION>'s southwestern coast threatened to
turn into complicate things on the Iditarod trail for the racers.
If the gale-driven snow reaches inland to the <ORGANIZATION>Iditarod Trail</ORGANIZATION>, the
going could turn slow.
   At the back of the pack, 290 miles behind the leaders, the
oldest Iditarod musher announced that he was dropping out of the
race. <PERSON>Norman Vaughan</PERSON>, 82, said three of his dogs were in heat and
he had whiteout conditions ahead.
   Another musher, <PERSON>Ray Dronenburg</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Trapper Creek</ORGANIZATION>, also scratched
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, saying several of his dogs were weak with a virus. That
leaves 50 mushers in the race, which started <DATE>Saturday</DATE>.
   A <MONEY>$30,000</MONEY> first prize awaits the winner, who is expected to
reach <LOCATION>Nome</LOCATION> sometime next week. The next 19 finishers will split the
rest of the <MONEY>$150,000</MONEY> purse.

   Among the perils threatening the 70
racers and dog teams who mush today in the 18th annual Iditarod
Trail Sled Dog Race are hunger-crazed moose and ash from the
Redoubt Volcano.
   Not to mention the weather.
   Temperatures hit the 40s and turned snow into slush on the
streets of downtown <LOCATION>Anchorage</LOCATION>, where the race begins. But
conditions are some of the harshest in the history of the race
along the 1,100-mile trail to <LOCATION>Nome</LOCATION> on the <LOCATION>Bering Sea</LOCATION>.
   ``Awful weather,'' said Race Manager <PERSON>Jack Niggemyer</PERSON>. ``It's
probably snowed 40 inches in the <DATE>last two days</DATE>.''
   The heavy snow has kept moose from grazing, setting the stage
for violent encounters between the huge animals and sled dog teams
on the remote trail, and prudent mushers are packing rifles.
   Redoubt has been erupting intermittently since <DATE>December</DATE>, spewing
ash as far north as the area around <LOCATION>Anchorage</LOCATION>.
   The race usually lasts from 11 to 18 days. The record time, set
by <PERSON>Susan Butcher of Manley</PERSON> in <DATE>1987</DATE>, was 11 days, two hours and five
minutes. Butcher also won in <DATE>1986</DATE> and <DATE>1988</DATE>.
   Since <PERSON>Libby Riddles</PERSON> became the first woman to win in <DATE>1985</DATE>, women
have won the race four of the last five years, inspiring a popular
T-shirt saying, ``<LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION>: Where men are men and women win the
Iditarod.''
   Some participants and race observers said they expect the pace
to be slowed this year because of the deep snow and poorly-packed
trail.
   ``We might run out of trail,'' said <PERSON>Lavon Barve</PERSON>, a musher from
<LOCATION>Wasilla</LOCATION> who finished fifth last year. ``It's up to the mushers to
snowshoe or whatever.''
   The Iditarod was begun in <DATE>1973</DATE> to commemorate the emergency
delivery of diphtheria serum to <LOCATION>Nome</LOCATION> by mail carriers driving dog
teams in <DATE>1925</DATE>.
   Taken overland after bad weather grounded airplanes, the serum
was credited with saving hundreds of lives in the remote town.
   From downtown <LOCATION>Anchorage</LOCATION>, the course goes northwest across the
<ORGANIZATION>Alaska Range</ORGANIZATION> and over the tundra before dropping down along the
<LOCATION>Yukon River</LOCATION> to the <LOCATION>Bering Sea</LOCATION>.
   Mushers must lay over for 24 hours of rest at some point along
the trail.
   The mystique of the Iditarod has grown steadily, with mushers
this year arriving from <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Switzerland</LOCATION>. Companies spend
<MONEY>tens of thousands of dollars</MONEY> to sponsor top competitors.
   <PERSON>Rick Swenson</PERSON> of <PERSON>Two Rivers</PERSON>, the only person to win the Iditarod
four times, will be trying for a fifth win.
   Last year's winner, <PERSON>Joe Runyan</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Nenana</LOCATION>, expects the teams to
start out slow because of bad weather.
   ``The big strategy this year in terms of snow is to reduce
injury,'' <PERSON>Runyan</PERSON> said.
   But the teams can't afford to be too slow, he said.
   ``Even if you're conservative, it's better to be in the front of
the pack.''

   <PERSON>Joe Runyan</PERSON> clung to his narrow lead in the
Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race as he approached the halfway point
<DATE>Thursday</DATE> in the 1,168-mile Anchorage-to-Nome trek.
   Runyan led the field into <PERSON>McGrath</PERSON> late <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> but surrendered
his lead when he decided to take the 24-hour rest stop required of
all mushers somwehere along the trail.
   Most of the other top teams had stopped earlier, accounting in
part for <PERSON>Runyan</PERSON>'s early lead. But storming out of <ORGANIZATION>McGrath</ORGANIZATION> on
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>evening</TIME>, the rested <PERSON>Runyan</PERSON> quickly regained the lead.
   He left Ophir at <TIME>4:45 a.m.</TIME> with a nine-minute edge on four-time
winner <PERSON>Rick Swenson</PERSON>.
   Five minutes behind <PERSON>Swenson</PERSON> was <PERSON>DeeDee Jonrowe</PERSON>, who held the lead
briefly <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>. Defending champion <PERSON>Susan Butcher</PERSON> moved out 12
minutes later, and <PERSON>Martin Buser</PERSON> was about 20 minutes behind her.
   Behind the leaders was a pack of 14 mushers, including race
founder <PERSON>Joe Redington</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jacques Philip</PERSON> of <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>. Forty-nine
mushers left the Iditarod starting line <DATE>Saturday</DATE> in <LOCATION>Anchorage</LOCATION>. Four
have dropped out.
   The next checkpoint is Iditarod, the ghost town for which the
trail and race are named. The first musher to reach Iditarod will
get <MONEY>$3,000</MONEY> in silver ingots. The race carries a <MONEY>$250,000</MONEY> purse, with
the winner getting <MONEY>$50,000</MONEY>.
   Iditarod is 610 miles from <LOCATION>Nome</LOCATION> and 558 miles from <LOCATION>Anchorage</LOCATION>.

at this <LOCATION>Bering Sea</LOCATION> village at <TIME>2:03 p.m.
   Butcher</TIME>, from <PERSON>Manley</PERSON>, logged in at <TIME>2:44 p.m.</TIME> with 11 dogs. Third

   Dee <PERSON>Dee Jonrowe</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Willow</ORGANIZATION> hit the trail <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> <TIME>morning two hours</TIME>
and three minutes after <PERSON>Swenson</PERSON>.
   The winner is expected to reach <LOCATION>Nome</LOCATION> on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME> after
brief stops at three remaining checkpoints.
   The first musher to cross the finish line on <LOCATION>Nome</LOCATION>'s historic
Front Street wins <MONEY>$50,000</MONEY>. The remaining <MONEY>$200,000</MONEY> is divided among
the next 19 finishers.
   With continued good weather expected, the final 171 miles of the
race across the ice of <ORGANIZATION>Norton Sound</ORGANIZATION> and along the hilly coastline to
<LOCATION>Nome</LOCATION> will boil down to speed and endurance.
   All four leaders took their final mandatory rest stops <DATE>Monday</DATE> in
<LOCATION>Unalakleet</LOCATION>.
   Although Butcher has fewer dogs remaining in her team than
<PERSON>Runyan</PERSON>, she said they appeared to be getting stronger.
   ``They're doing the Butcher tricks for me,'' she said early
<DATE>Tuesday</DATE>. ``They know where they are (in the race).''
   As of <TIME>midday</TIME> <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, 41 mushers remained in the race; eight have
scratched since the race began <DATE>March 4</DATE> in <LOCATION>Anchorage</LOCATION>.
   The annual race began 17 years ago and was inspired by a <DATE>1925</DATE>
relay of serum to <LOCATION>Nome</LOCATION> during a diphtheria outbreak. The race is put
on largely by volunteers.

<TEXT>
   The goodwill resulting from a thaw in
relations between <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> is spreading from
people to dogs.
   <PERSON>Susan Butcher</PERSON>, a three-time winner of the 1,100-mile Iditarod
Trail Sled Dog Race, was to leave <DATE>Friday</DATE> for the <LOCATION>Soviet Far East</LOCATION>
along with a veterinarian and two <ORGANIZATION>Iditarod Trail Committee</ORGANIZATION>
officials.
   The group has three goals:
   _ Find two Soviet mushers who would live in <LOCATION>Manley</LOCATION> with <PERSON>Butcher</PERSON>
and her husband, <PERSON>Dave Monson</PERSON>, another winning musher, and learn the
ropes about sled dog racing, Alaska-style.
   _ Examine sled dogs used in the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> for size and
stamina comparisons with their <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION> counterparts.
   _ Organize a committee on the Soviet side of the <LOCATION>Bering Strait</LOCATION>
that would help lay out a route for a new, international sled dog
race which would start in <LOCATION>Nome</LOCATION> and end in the <LOCATION>U.S.S.R.</LOCATION>, after
contestants had been flown across the strait.
   <PERSON>Ginna Brelsford</PERSON>, with the <ORGANIZATION>Alaska Office of International Trade</ORGANIZATION>
and a member of the <LOCATION>Bering</LOCATION> Bridge Expedition which traveled 1,000
miles last <DATE>spring</DATE> by sled dog and kayak from the <LOCATION>Soviet Far East</LOCATION> to
<LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION>, helped arrange this week-long trip.
   ``All that sounds easy, but it's amazing how much time it takes
to get things done over there,'' <PERSON>Brelsford</PERSON> said of the goals for
<ORGANIZATION>Butcher</ORGANIZATION>'s trip.
   The Soviets are no strangers to using dogs in the Arctic, but
they lag far behind the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> in developing racing equipment and
techniques, she said.
   ``When we introduced our sleds, they were excited about how
light and how flexible they were and how easily they could be taken
apart,'' <PERSON>Brelsford</PERSON> said of her trek last <DATE>spring</DATE>.
   ``They still operate with heavy leather harnesses and use ivory
hooks to connect things. Their technology is old when it comes to
using dogs and sleds.''
   ``Generally, they use freight animals _ dogs bigger than what
you see running the Iditarod but not necessarily better,''
<PERSON>Brelsford</PERSON> said.
   Monson and <ORGANIZATION>Butcher</ORGANIZATION> have 120 dogs in their <PERSON>Manley</PERSON> kennel, but
<PERSON>Monson</PERSON> said they always are looking for new bloodlines.
   ``Anything that will improve the general makeup of a sled dog so
it would perform better would be of interest,'' <PERSON>Monson</PERSON> said.
   The new race would be operated separately from the Iditarod,
said <PERSON>Rosemary Phillips</PERSON>, executive director of the race established
in <DATE>1973</DATE>.
   ``We will not be taking anything from the Iditarod Sled Dog Race
to put this on, excepting experience,'' <PERSON>Phillips</PERSON> said. ``We've had
very positive responses from mushers _ lots and lots of calls
wondering how they could enter.''
   The race would be run about the end of <DATE>March</DATE>, at least two weeks
after the winner of the Iditarod crosses the finish line in <LOCATION>Nome</LOCATION>,
she said.
   ``Mushers are a sturdy bunch. You might see much the same teams
in there from the Iditarod.''
   The route would be from <LOCATION>Nome</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Wales</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION>. From there,
mushers and dogs would be flown across the <LOCATION>Bering Strait</LOCATION> for a
restart in <LOCATION>Uelen</LOCATION> in the <LOCATION>U.S.S.R.</LOCATION> and the eventual finish at <LOCATION>Anadyr</LOCATION>,
she said.
   ``We would love to do it in <DATE>1990</DATE>,'' <PERSON>Phillips</PERSON> said.
``Realistically speaking, it probably will be <DATE>1991</DATE>.''
   The group also will be recruiting Soviet mushers and teams for
the Iditarod.
   ``Things like this just serve to break down the barriers,''
<PERSON>Phillips</PERSON> said. ``It's making the world smaller.''

<HEAD>Hypothermal Musher Rescued in Dog-Sled Race</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GRAYLING, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A helicopter crew flew to a remote
encampment <DATE>Saturday</DATE> to rescue a competitor in the Iditarod Trail
Sled Dog Race who was reported to be suffering from hypothermia and
shock.
   <PERSON>Mike Madden</PERSON>, 27, of <LOCATION>North Pole</LOCATION>, was rescued by a military
helicopter at about <TIME>9:30 a.m.</TIME>, eight hours after fellow musher <PERSON>Jerry
Austin</PERSON> told race officials that <PERSON>Madden</PERSON> needed help, members of the
race board said.
   <PERSON>Madden</PERSON> was 30 miles east of the checkpoint at <LOCATION>Iditarod</LOCATION>, which
marks the half-way point of the 1,168 mile race. Race officials said
<PERSON>Madden</PERSON>'s condition stabilized after he was flown to <PERSON>McGrath</PERSON> en route
to an <LOCATION>Anchorage</LOCATION> hospital.
   The <ORGANIZATION>National Weather Service</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Anchorage</LOCATION> said the low
temperature in <LOCATION>Iditarod</LOCATION> <DATE>early Saturday</DATE> was probably about 5 degrees.
   An HH-3 ``Jolly Green Giant'' helicopter from <ORGANIZATION>Elmendorf Air Force
Base</ORGANIZATION> flew a doctor, accompanied by <LOCATION>Austin</LOCATION>, to help <PERSON>Madden</PERSON>, who also
was reported to have injured his knee while chopping dogfood earlier
in the race.
   Austin intended to take care of <PERSON>Madden</PERSON>'s dogs after the
evacuation, said <PERSON>Leo Rasmussen</PERSON>, president of the Iditarod board. The
detour was a setback for <LOCATION>Austin</LOCATION>, who has already been hampered by
sick dogs.
   ``It destroys his chances for a top 20 finish, and will probably
make him one of the last teams to come into <LOCATION>Nome</LOCATION>,'' race board
member <PERSON>Tom Busch</PERSON> said. Busch added that three rookie mushers who
stayed with <PERSON>Madden</PERSON> while <LOCATION>Austin</LOCATION> was fetching help probably ruined
their chances for the Rookie of the Year award.
   <PERSON>Madden</PERSON>, a carpenter, moved to <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION> from Billings, <LOCATION>Mont.</LOCATION>, in
<DATE>1983</DATE> and began mushing the following year. He was running in the
Iditarod for the first time.
   Veteran musher <PERSON>Martin Buser</PERSON> led the Anchorage-to-Nome race on its
eighth day. Buser, 30, left <LOCATION>Grayling</LOCATION> at <TIME>3:34 a.m.</TIME>, about four hours
ahead of <PERSON>Susan Butcher</PERSON> and <PERSON>Rick Swenson</PERSON>. Grayline is 497 miles from
the finish line in <LOCATION>Nome</LOCATION>.
   Butcher has won the last three races and <PERSON>Swenson</PERSON> is a four-time
champion. Buser, who runs a kennel in <LOCATION>Big Lake</LOCATION>, has never won the
Iditarod but finished third in last year's race.
   With <PERSON>Madden</PERSON> apparently out of the race, the field of contenders
fell to 41, the lowest figure since <DATE>1985</DATE>. Forty-nine mushers were in
the lineup when the race began <DATE>March 4</DATE>.
   Mushers are vying for a <MONEY>$250,000</MONEY> purse, including <MONEY>$50,000</MONEY> for the
winner.

A moose knocked four-time winner <PERSON>Rick Swenson</PERSON> out of the lead of the <ORGANIZATION>Iditarod 
Trail Sled Dog Race</ORGANIZATION> <DATE>today</DATE>, stomping through his team and slowing him enough to 
allow defending champion <PERSON>Joe Runyan</PERSON> to move in front. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Swenson</PERSON> had left <PERSON>McGrath</PERSON> hours before anyone else, but he turned back after the 
run-in with the moose and waited for other racers to try their luck with the 
animal. 
</P>
<P>
A veterinarian checked out one of <ORGANIZATION>Swenson</ORGANIZATION>'s injured dogs, which was pronounced 
fit. 
</P>
<P>
Nine other racers set out before dawn -- none reporting any more moose -- but 
<PERSON>Swenson</PERSON> waited for daylight before returning to the trail, and that dropped him 
to 10th place. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Swenson</PERSON> said he saw the moose ahead of him at the first river portage about a 
mile out of <ORGANIZATION>McGrath</ORGANIZATION> and was trying to cross the river ahead of it. 
</P>
<P>
"She was on the river," <PERSON>Swenson</PERSON> said. "It was just one of those normal races to 
see who would get there first." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Swenson</PERSON> said he had hoped the moose would keep going, but it turned into his 
team, trampling some of the dogs and turning them back on the sled. 
</P>
<P>
While <PERSON>Swenson</PERSON> waited, the nine who set out included <PERSON>Runyan</PERSON>, <PERSON>Lavon Barve</PERSON> and 
three-time winner <PERSON>Susan Butcher</PERSON>. Runyan was first into the next checkpoint 23 
miles away at <LOCATION>Takotna</LOCATION> and headed on to <LOCATION>Ophir</LOCATION>, a ghost town left from 
turn-of-the-century gold mining days. 
</P>
<P>
Officials in <ORGANIZATION>McGrath</ORGANIZATION> rerouted the race through town because of deep snow along 
the usual <LOCATION>Kuskokwim River</LOCATION> route. 
</P>
<P>
On <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, Butcher came upon seventh-placed <PERSON>Tim Osmar</PERSON> as he fired shots into 
the air to scare off a buffalo that would not leave the trail. 
</P>
<P>
"<PERSON>Susan Butcher</PERSON> showed up in her red (snow) suit and that's what did it," <PERSON>Osmar</PERSON> 
said. "She scared the buffalo right on." 
</P>
<P>
Mushers are encountering some of the 800 animals that freely roam <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION> in 
five herds. 
</P>
<P>
In all, 18 of the 68 teams still in the endurance run from <LOCATION>Anchorage</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Nome</LOCATION> 
had pulled into <ORGANIZATION>McGrath</ORGANIZATION> by <TIME>6:30 a.m.</TIME> <DATE>today</DATE>.

   Strong winds and unseasonably warm
temperatures whittled a 70-year-old musher's lead in the 1,150-mile
Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race to a matter of minutes, according to
standings <TIME>this morning</TIME>.
   At last report, <PERSON>Joe Redington</PERSON>, known as the ``Father of the
Iditarod'' because he helped organize the first race <DATE>16 years ago</DATE>,
still was on the trail between Cripple and <ORGANIZATION>Sulatna Crossing</ORGANIZATION> today,
the seventh day of the race.
   It's only 47 miles between the two checkpoints, and the length
of time it was taking <LOCATION>Redington</LOCATION> to cover the distance was a
reflection of the weather. Normally, Iditarod teams average 8-10
mph.
   All 50 dog teams in the race from <LOCATION>Anchorage</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Nome</LOCATION> were slowed
<DATE>Thursday</DATE> by temperatures that climbed into the 40s, turning the
trail soggy and overheating the cold-loving huskies who pull the
sleds.
   Redington waited 11 hours after reaching Cripple for more
favorable weather, and by the time he decided to move, second-place
<PERSON>Herbie Nayokpuk</PERSON> decided his team was rested enough to push on.
   Nayokpuk, known as the <LOCATION>Shishmaref Cannonball</LOCATION>, had arrived in
Cripple more than six hours behind <LOCATION>Redington</LOCATION>, but he left at <TIME>3:20
p.m.</TIME>, only five minutes after the leader.
   In third place was <ORGANIZATION>Martin Buser of Big Lake</ORGANIZATION>, who pulled into
Cripple at <TIME>2:50 p.m</TIME>. He was followed by four-time Iditarod champion
<PERSON>Rick Swenson</PERSON> of Two Rivers at <TIME>3:20 p.m.</TIME>; <PERSON>Joe Garnie</PERSON> of Teller at
<TIME>3:22 p.m.</TIME>; and defending champion <PERSON>Susan Butcher</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Manley</LOCATION> at <TIME>4:35
p.m.</TIME>
   <LOCATION>Redington</LOCATION>, who arrived in <LOCATION>Cripple</LOCATION>, 525 miles from the start, at
<TIME>4:50 a.m.</TIME>, tried leaving at <TIME>9 a.m.</TIME> <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, but the sun-softened
snow turned him around.
   ``No use to fight that. Let it harden up a little bit,'' he said
just before leaving <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME>. ``The dogs were right up to
their bellies, going along about 4 to 5 miles an hour. I went out
about three miles and came back. Thought I'd wait a while.''
   The delay gave an advantage to teams that have been hounding
<LOCATION>Redington</LOCATION> since he took the lead 260 miles back in <LOCATION>Rohn</LOCATION>, but he
said there was little choice, given the soft trail.
   ``It doesn't hurt to give the dogs a little more rest,'' he said.
   From Cripple, the trail heads to <ORGANIZATION>Ruby</ORGANIZATION>, on the <LOCATION>Yukon River</LOCATION>, then
follows the frozen river to <LOCATION>Kaltag</LOCATION> and cuts over to <LOCATION>Unalakleet</LOCATION> on
the <LOCATION>Bering Sea</LOCATION> coast.
   The first musher to reach <LOCATION>Nome</LOCATION> will win <MONEY>$30,000</MONEY>. The next 19
finishers will split the rest of a <MONEY>$150,000</MONEY> purse.
   Two teams have dropped out of the race, and two of the more than
800 dogs running have died, race officials said. Both deaths were
ruled accidental.

<TEXT>
   Mushers in the 1,150-mile Iditarod Trail
Sled Dog Race traded rolling hills for the flat expanse of the
frozen <LOCATION>Yukon River</LOCATION> as they tried to catch 70-year-old <PERSON>Joe
Redington</PERSON>, who's led since <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
   Redington arrived at <ORGANIZATION>Ruby</ORGANIZATION>, a Yukon village 653 miles from the
race's start in <LOCATION>Anchorage</LOCATION> and the first checkpoint on the river, at
<TIME>12:30 p.m. Friday and left six hours later</TIME>.
   His closest rival, <ORGANIZATION>Martin Buser of Big Lake</ORGANIZATION>, pulled in at <TIME>5:05
p.m</TIME>. In third was <PERSON>Herbie Nayokpuk</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Shishmaref</LOCATION>, who arrived in
<LOCATION>Ruby</LOCATION> at <TIME>6:20 p.m.</TIME>
   Four-time Iditarod champion <PERSON>Rick Swenson</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Two Rivers</ORGANIZATION> was
running fourth. He checked out of Cripple, 120 miles back, at <TIME>7:25
p.m.</TIME> <DATE>Thursday</DATE>. <PERSON>Joe Garnie</PERSON> of Teller followed <PERSON>Swenson</PERSON> out at <TIME>8:45
p.m.</TIME>, and defending champion <PERSON>Susan Butcher</PERSON> of <PERSON>Manley</PERSON> left at <TIME>9:50
p.m.</TIME>
   <LOCATION>Jerry Austin</LOCATION> of <ORGANIZATION>St. Michael</ORGANIZATION>, running in eighth place, said he
and several mushers near him are still strong contenders in a race
that won't reach the finish line in <LOCATION>Nome</LOCATION> until later next week.
   ``Don't write off anybody that's three or six hours off the pace
right now,'' he said in Cripple. ``We're just inching our way up.
We're steadily gaining on them.''
   Butcher noted that <LOCATION>Redington</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Nayokpuk</PERSON> took their mandatory
24-hour layovers early in the race, an advantage because the
leaders later got bogged down in new snow. But that advantage may
be wearing thin, she said.
   ``It was a break for them in the beginning, but now they've been
going with no real long rest for a while. I think our dogs are
fresher,'' she said.
   But <PERSON>Nayokpuk</PERSON>, who couldn't keep up with <LOCATION>Redington</LOCATION> between
Cripple and <ORGANIZATION>Ruby</ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON>Butcher</PERSON> and <PERSON>Swenson</PERSON> may have trouble
catching <LOCATION>Redington</LOCATION>.
   ``I tried to travel with <PERSON>Joe Redington</PERSON> from Cripple, but he
disappeared in a hurry,'' a tired <PERSON>Nayokpuk</PERSON> said as he sat on the
porch of a house in <LOCATION>Ruby</LOCATION> and changed his boots. ``I never saw him
again. He has the dogs. If he gets those dogs running to <LOCATION>Nome</LOCATION>, he's
going to be a hard one to beat.''
   Redington is known as the Father of the Iditarod for helping
found the race 16 years ago.
   The race started <DATE>March 5</DATE> in <LOCATION>Anchorage</LOCATION>. After Ruby, mushers race
146 miles downriver to the village of <LOCATION>Kaltag</LOCATION>, then cross to the
<LOCATION>Bering Sea</LOCATION> coast for a final dash to <LOCATION>Nome</LOCATION>.
   The winner will collect <MONEY>$30,000</MONEY> of a <MONEY>$150,000</MONEY> purse; the next 19
finishers will split the rest. Two of the 52 teams that started the
race have dropped out.

   Soviet mushers will compete for the
first time this winter in the 1,100-mile Iditarod sled dog race and
will get their training and equipment from three-time champion
<PERSON>Susan Butcher</PERSON>.
   Butcher is taking a crash course in Russian for the 1,100-mile
trek and provided dogs and sleds for the two Soviets, who arrive
<DATE>Nov. 1</DATE> for four months of training with <PERSON>Butcher</PERSON> and her husband,
<PERSON>Dave Monson</PERSON>.
   ``They'll be using my dogs this year,'' she said <DATE>Monday</DATE>. ``In
subsequent races, they'll be bringing over their own.
   ``There's just not enough time to make a trained racing team out
of inexperienced racers. They know how to work dogs, but that's
quite different from racing. They're coming over with nothing but
their cold-weather gear.''
   In its 17 years, the Anchorage-to-Nome race has included mushers
from <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Norway</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>, among other nations, but
none from the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Rosemary Phillips</PERSON>, Iditarod executive director, said the Soviets
also have agreed to help organize an invitational Alaska-Soviet
race in <DATE>1991</DATE>. It would cover about 1,000 miles from <LOCATION>Nome</LOCATION> to the
Soviet port city of <LOCATION>Anadyr</LOCATION>.
   ``The Soviets are not familiar with sled dog racing as we know
it _ especially long-distance racing,'' <PERSON>Phillips</PERSON> said. ``They'll
train here, in <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION>, and then they'll return to train others.''
   One of the Soviets is <PERSON>Nicholai Yettiye</PERSON>, 25, a secondary school
physical education teacher and a member of an expedition that
traveled 1,000 miles last <DATE>spring</DATE> by sled dog and kayak from the
<LOCATION>Soviet Far East</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION>.
   The other is <PERSON>Alexander Reznyuk</PERSON>, 43, chairman of a regional
sports committee.
   Fifty-four mushers have signed up for the <DATE>1990</DATE> Iditarod,
scheduled to begin <DATE>March 4</DATE> and pay out <MONEY>$275,000</MONEY> in prize money.
   Butcher and <PERSON>Monson</PERSON> supplied a dog team for an Australian musher
in <DATE>1985</DATE> and for a Norwegian in <DATE>1986</DATE>. The Norwegian, <PERSON>Rune
Hesthammer</PERSON>, came in 10th and was Rookie of the Year, <PERSON>Butcher</PERSON> said.
   Butcher has 130 dogs in her kennel, more than enough to go
around.

<HEAD>The Iditarod Mushes Through Red Ink</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL JENKINS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When the first musher charges north in
the 16th annual Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race on <DATE>Saturday</DATE>,
organizers already will have their own victory, over <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION>'s
economic bust and the race's <MONEY>$773,000</MONEY> debt.
   Fifty-five mushers have signed up for the rugged 1,100-mile
contest billed as ``the Last Great Race on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.'' Last year, 63
teams signed up; the year before, 73.
   This year's field includes four-time champion <PERSON>Rick Swenson</PERSON>;
two-time winner <PERSON>Susan Butcher</PERSON>, whose <MONEY>$50,000</MONEY> winner's check last
year bounced; <DATE>1983</DATE> champion <PERSON>Rick Mackey</PERSON>; and 16 rookies. Mushers
from <LOCATION>Austria</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Great Britain</ORGANIZATION> also have signed up.
   The race is named after the <ORGANIZATION>Iditarod Trail</ORGANIZATION>, an old gold rush and
mail route to <LOCATION>Nome</LOCATION>. This year's race takes mushers over the tougher
northern route, where temperatures, although moderate of late, can
reach minus 50 degrees.
   Starting in downtown <LOCATION>Anchorage</LOCATION> on trucked-in snow, racers must
cross over the <ORGANIZATION>Alaska Range</ORGANIZATION>, traverse frozen tundra and climb the
timbered <LOCATION>Kuskokwim Mountains</LOCATION> to reach the <LOCATION>Yukon River</LOCATION> at <ORGANIZATION>Ruby</ORGANIZATION>, an
old gold mining community.
   The mushers trek south on the Yukon and turn toward the coast at
<LOCATION>Kaltag</LOCATION>. At <LOCATION>Unalakleet</LOCATION>, the teams turn north and run along the
windblown coast and sea ice to <LOCATION>Nome</LOCATION>'s Front Street.
   The trail became part of <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION>'s legends in <DATE>1925</DATE>, when 20
mushers pushed for 127{ hours to relay diphtheria serum 674 miles
from <LOCATION>Nenana</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Nome</LOCATION> to save the city from an epidemic.
   After the check issued Butcher bounced, a special audit in <DATE>April</DATE>
found the race was <MONEY>$773,000</MONEY> in debt, said <PERSON>Rosemary Phillips</PERSON>, the
race's executive director.
   ``I suppose the economy had a lot to do with it,'' she said.
``The Iditarod was caught up in the collapse. More was spent than
was taken in.''
   Oil prices peaked at about <MONEY>$30</MONEY> a barrel in <DATE>1985</DATE> but plunged to
less than <MONEY>$10</MONEY> by <DATE>July 1986</DATE>. About <PERCENT>85 percent</PERCENT> of the state's
revenues come from royalties and taxes paid by the oil industry.
When oil prices fell, the state's economy, heavily dependent on
state expenditures, went into the abyss.
   Bankruptcies and foreclosures soared. Property values tumbled,
jobs dried up and businesses closed, but the Iditarod, which relies
on private contributions, did not get the message.
   ``We had a hard time seeing our problem,'' said <ORGANIZATION>Iditarod Trail
Committee</ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON>Lavon Barve</PERSON>. ``There was a budget, and the
money was spent for that budget, but the money didn't come in.''
   <PERSON>Joe Redington</PERSON>, an Iditarod board member and race founder, said
the race was spending money for things it did not need. ``We spent
a lot of money and didn't pay no bills,'' he said. ``It was spent
unwisely. We had too many employees. We had top salaries and all
the benefits. We had better insurance than <ORGANIZATION>General Motors</ORGANIZATION>.''
   When the race's financial problems became known, officials cut
the staff by two-thirds. ``We had 34 to start with. The rest took
pay cuts. We cut all benefits,'' <PERSON>Phillips</PERSON> said.
   <PERSON>Joanne Potts</PERSON>, race coordinator since <DATE>1983</DATE>, said about 700
volunteers, such as pilots and ham radio operators, worked for the
race last year. She expected about 1,200 this year.
   While cutting expenses, the race also has found new sponsors. A
footwear manufacturer's four-year sponsorship could bring in more
than <MONEY>$500,000</MONEY>, <PERSON>Phillips</PERSON> said. A dog food manufacturer agreed to a
one-year contract worth more than <MONEY>$25,000</MONEY>. A television network has
offered <MONEY>$15,000</MONEY> for coverage rights.
   Merchandising the Iditarod name on everything from beer steins
to buttons makes up as much as <PERCENT>40 percent</PERCENT> of the race's revenues,
she said.
   ``As of right now, our outstanding debts are about <MONEY>$220,000</MONEY>. I
think it's fantastic,'' <PERSON>Phillips</PERSON> said. This year's purse will be at
least <MONEY>$125,000</MONEY>, still the largest purse in sled dog racing, she
said.
   <PERSON>Potts</PERSON> said she never doubted the race would continue.
   ``There were people <DATE>last June</DATE> who didn't think we were going to
have a race this year,'' she said. ``We fooled them. We're going to
have one. It's just bigger than all the little problems we had last
year.''

   The 70-year-old founder of the Iditarod
Trail Sled Dog Race surrendered the lead <DATE>Saturday</DATE> after setting the
pace for more than 400 miles, and the leaders raced down the frozen
<LOCATION>Yukon River</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Joe Redington</PERSON> lost the lead to <PERSON>Martin Buser</PERSON>, who left <ORGANIZATION>Galena</ORGANIZATION>
with his dogs about an hour ahead of <LOCATION>Redington</LOCATION>. They were still
about an hour apart when they reached Nulato, 52 miles downstream
and 400 miles from the finish in <LOCATION>Nome</LOCATION>.
   The race started in <LOCATION>Anchorage</LOCATION> on <DATE>March 5</DATE>. The first musher to
<LOCATION>Nome</LOCATION> will collect <MONEY>$30,000</MONEY> of a <MONEY>$150,000</MONEY> purse; the next 19
finishers will split the rest. Three of the 52 teams that started
the race have dropped out, including one <DATE>Saturday</DATE>.
   Redington, who founded the race in <DATE>1973</DATE>, has never won, although
he has competed in all but two <LOCATION>Iditarods</LOCATION>.
   Redington had a 4{-hour lead when he left Ruby on <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>evening</TIME>
but <PERSON>Buser</PERSON>, who moved to <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION> from <LOCATION>Switzerland</LOCATION> in <DATE>1979</DATE>, made up
time during the night. Redington dropped one dog in <LOCATION>Galena</LOCATION>, leaving
him with just nine. Buser also dropped one, but still had 14 in
harness.
   ``I tried to travel with <PERSON>Joe Redington</PERSON> from Cripple, but he
disappeared in a hurry,'' said veteran <PERSON>Herbie Nayokpuk</PERSON>. ``I never
saw him again. He has the dogs. If he gets those dogs running to
<LOCATION>Nome</LOCATION>, he's going to be a hard one to beat.''
   <PERSON>Rick Swenson</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Two Rivers</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Susan Butcher of Manley</PERSON>, the only
mushers ever to win the marathon race more than once, arrived in
<LOCATION>Galena</LOCATION> about an hour before <PERSON>Buser</PERSON> left. <PERSON>Swenson</PERSON>, a four-time
winner, and <PERSON>Butcher</PERSON>, who won the last two races in record time,
each had 13 dogs.
   Nayokpuk, who had been near the lead throughout, checked in at
<LOCATION>Galena</LOCATION> at midmorning, and by <TIME>afternoon</TIME>, 10 mushers had reached
there.
   ``Don't write off anybody that's three or six hours off the pace
right now,'' said one of them, <PERSON>Jerry Austin</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>St. Michael</ORGANIZATION>. ``We're
just inching our way up. We're steadily gaining on them.''
   <PERSON>Jacques Philip</PERSON>, of Thomery, <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, led the foreign mushers in
15th place. <PERSON>Horst Maas</PERSON>, of <PERSON>Lenz</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Austria</LOCATION>, was in 25th; <PERSON>Peter

   Throngs crowding a downtown street
covered with trucked-in snow cheered <DATE>Saturday</DATE> as 49 mushers and
hundreds of dogs charged off on the first leg of the 1,168-mile
Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race from <LOCATION>Anchorage</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Nome</LOCATION>.
   The 17th annual race over the <ORGANIZATION>Alaska Range</ORGANIZATION>, across desolate
stretches and along the storm-raked coast began in clear, windy
weather at <TIME>9 a.m.</TIME>, with veteran musher <PERSON>Jerry Austin</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>St. Michael</ORGANIZATION>
first out of the chute.
   <PERSON>Susan Butcher</PERSON>, aiming for her fourth consecutive win and the
<MONEY>$50,000</MONEY> winner's share of the <MONEY>$250,000</MONEY> purse, was 19th to leave in
the succession of departures spaced two minutes apart. Rival <PERSON>Rick
Swenson</PERSON> of <PERSON>Two Rivers</PERSON>, the only person to win the race four times,
was No. 22.
   ``I feel great! I feel great!'' Butcher, 33, of <PERSON>Manley</PERSON> said with
a laugh as she hugged a well-wisher before the start of her 12th
Iditarod. Last year, she finished in just under 11 days and 12 hours.
   ``I think that I can take the pressure,'' she said. ``I know that
everybody's gunning for me, I know that everybody's after me, but I
don't see how they can be more after me than they were last year.''
   A temperature of 13 degrees and winds gusting to 46 mph combined
for a wind chill of minus 22 degrees at the race's start. Stronger
wind and clear skies were reported along the first stretch of the
race route.
   The snow was trucked in because the streets had been swept.
   Some observers crowded into a fast-food restaurant to stay warm
while awaiting the start. Children outside hawked Iditarod
newspapers and a man wearing a sandwich sign advertised Iditarod
photographs.
   The race, inspired by a sled-dog relay of serum to <LOCATION>Nome</LOCATION> for a
diptheria outbreak in <DATE>1925</DATE>, began in <DATE>1973</DATE>.
   The number of competitors dropped this year in part because the
record cold spell of <DATE>January</DATE> and <DATE>February</DATE> prevented mushers from
giving their dogs enough training, said race manager <PERSON>Jack Niggemyer</PERSON>.
There were 53 competitors last year.
   The racers will stop at 25 checkpoints along the route, where
they will get food for themselves and their dogs. Along the way,
they will camp out or stay in homes or lodges.
   Commercial subsidies for the race have grown substantially over
the years, with money coming from a variety of sources, including
television rights, dog-food companies and manufacturers of
cold-weather gear.
   <PERSON>Joe Redington</PERSON>, the 72-year-old ``Father of the Iditarod,'' stood
by his dogs early <DATE>Saturday</DATE> as he waited to compete for the 15th time.
   ``I'm a little more serious this year than I have been before,''
said <LOCATION>Redington</LOCATION>, who has never won the race. ``I usually go out and
have a good time. I'll be a little more serious now.''
   Libby Riddles, whose <DATE>1985</DATE> victory made her the first woman to win
the Iditarod, is back after missing two of the last three races and
dropping out of a third.
   ``I'm just real anxious to get on the trail,'' said <PERSON>Riddles</PERSON>, 32 ,
of <LOCATION>Nome</LOCATION>. ``I feel prepared for anything.''

<TEXT>
   Seventy-year-old <PERSON>Joe Redington</PERSON> dashed out
of this checkpoint <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> in the 1,150-mile Iditarod Trail Sled
Dog Race, declaring, ``I feel like an old fox being chased by 50
young hounds.''
   The second-oldest racer in the Anchorage-to <LOCATION>Nome</LOCATION> mushing
marathon left this <LOCATION>Kuskokwim River</LOCATION> town after staying about four
hours to feed and rest his 14 dogs.
   Known as the Father of the Iditarod, the <LOCATION>Wasilla</LOCATION> resident helped
create the <DATE>race 16 years ago</DATE> but has never won, even though he has
competed nearly every year.
   Redington arrived in <LOCATION>McGrath</LOCATION>, 410 miles into the race, at <TIME>6:48
a.m</TIME>. He was followed by <PERSON>Herbie Nayokpuk</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Shishmaref</LOCATION> at <TIME>10:26 a.m.</TIME>
Behind them, in order, were <PERSON>Jan Masek</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Anchorage</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Joe Garnie</PERSON>
of Teller.
   Two other mushers _ <PERSON>Joe Runyan</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Nenana</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Ralph</PERSON> ``Babe''
<PERSON>Anderson</PERSON> of <PERSON>McGrath</PERSON> _ also arrived in the morning but were not
among the leaders because they had not yet taken their mandatory
24-hour layovers.
   Redington, <ORGANIZATION>Nayokpuk</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Garnie</PERSON> took their layovers early in the
race, which began <DATE>Saturday</DATE>. That turned out to be a successful
strategy, because a pack of about 20 leading mushers later bogged
down in new snow. As those mushers took their 24-hour layover in
<LOCATION>Rohn</LOCATION>, they watched helplessly as <LOCATION>Redington</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Nayokpuk</ORGANIZATION> and Garnie
sailed past on the smooth trail they had packed.
   One of those was the defending champion, <PERSON>Susan Butcher of
Manley</PERSON>, who was in fifth place.
   Some racers said that despite <LOCATION>Redington</LOCATION>'s lead, <PERSON>Nayokpuk</PERSON> is now
the musher to beat because his dogs are stronger.
   ``I think it's going to take us quite a while to gain that kind
of time back, unless he runs into some kind of situation up
ahead,'' four-time Iditarod champion <PERSON>Rick Swenson</PERSON> said in <LOCATION>Rohn</LOCATION>.
   Meanwhile, at the back of the pack, <PERSON>Norman Vaughan</PERSON> announced
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE> that he was dropping out. Vaughan, at 82 the oldest
Iditarod musher, was the only one left at the <LOCATION>Puntilla Lake</LOCATION>
checkpoint, 290 miles behind the leaders. Another musher also
dropped out, leaving the number of competitors at 50.
   A <MONEY>$30,000</MONEY> first prize awaits the winner in <LOCATION>Nome</LOCATION>, with the rest
of the <MONEY>$150,000</MONEY> purse to be split among the next 19 finishers.

   Greeted by sirens and shouts, <PERSON>Susan Butcher</PERSON>
stormed into this Gold Rush town <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> in sub-zero weather and
record time to rack up her fourth victory in five years in the
1,158 mile Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race.
   Butcher, 33, of <LOCATION>Manley</LOCATION>, became only the second four-time winner
of the 18-year-old Anchorage-to-Nome marathon.
   Butcher was running about two hours ahead of defending champion
<PERSON>Joe Runyan</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Nenana</LOCATION>, a reversal of positions from the <DATE>1989</DATE> finish.
   Runyan won that race with a one-hour, five-minute cushion over
<LOCATION>Butcher</LOCATION>.
   Butcher finished with 11 dogs. During her 11 days on the trail
she had to drop three veteran dogs that pulled her to her previous
victories. She credited her unknown canines for the victory.
   ``This team has been absolutely incredible,'' <PERSON>Butcher</PERSON> said.
``I've never had a team go as strong as this.
   ``I don't know what's in that team that could do it, but it must
be the combination working together. There's been no strong dog
emerge from this group.''
   Her official time was 11 days, 1 hour, 53 minutes and 23
seconds. That is an all-time record, beating by more than 10
minutes her <DATE>1987</DATE> mark of 11 days, 2 hours and 5 minutes, which was
set on another route.
   The previous record for the northern route _ also set by Butcher
in <DATE>1986</DATE> _ was 11 days, 15 hours and 6 minutes.
   Butcher said it was extraordinary to break the record on the
slightly longer northern route.
   ``This team had power coming out of its ears,'' she said. ``Not
so much charging up hills, but stamina. It just had it.''
   She wins <MONEY>$50,000</MONEY> in first-place money plus <MONEY>$25,000</MONEY> from <LOCATION>Purina
Pro Plan</LOCATION>, one of her sponsors.
   The rest of the <MONEY>$200,000</MONEY> purse will be split among the next 19
finishers.
   The record time came as a surprise this year. The 70 mushers who
began the race <DATE>March 3</DATE> had to contend with the deepest snow in a
quarter-century, ash from Redoubt Volcano, some unseasonably warm
days that tired their dogs, buffalo on the trail and marauding
moose.
   Forced to forage in shoulder-deep snow, moose are especially
aggressive this winter. At least two mushers had run-ins with the
huge animals, with tangled their lines and stomped their dogs.
   The only other four-time winner is <PERSON>Rick Swenson</PERSON>, who was leading
out of <ORGANIZATION>McGrath</ORGANIZATION> near the halfway point. Swenson, of <ORGANIZATION>Trapper Creek</ORGANIZATION>,
had to turn back and have his team checked by a veterinarian after
one such encounter.
   That cost him the race. <PERSON>Swenson</PERSON> was running in sixth place
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
   People emptied out of bars and stores as Butcher headed down
Front Street to cross under the large burl sign that symbolizes the
finish line.
   Nome's populaton of 3,000 roughly doubles during the Iditarod as
the community is host of an amateur basketball tournament involving
53 teams from more than a dozen villages in northern and western
<LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION>.
   In addition to her four victories, <ORGANIZATION>Butcher</ORGANIZATION> has finished second
three times, and among the top 10 four other times.
   The only other woman to win the grueling race, <PERSON>Libby Riddles</PERSON> of
<LOCATION>Nome</LOCATION>, watched the finish on sunny streets in minus 10-degree
temperatures.
   ``She outraced these guys. She maintained her dog team better,''
<PERSON>Riddles</PERSON> said. ``You make your luck.''
   The Iditarod, named after an old supply route to the gold mining
districts of interior <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION>, draws its inspiration from a <DATE>1925</DATE>
relay of diptheria serum from <LOCATION>Nenana</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Nome</LOCATION>, which was hit hard by
an outbreak of the disease.
   Butcher began 68th of 70 mushers, but moved into the lead just
after the halfway point, and alternated with <PERSON>Runyan</PERSON> and <PERSON>Lavon Barve</PERSON>
of <LOCATION>Wasilla</LOCATION> as the teams reached the windblown <LOCATION>Bering Sea</LOCATION> coast near
the end.
   Breaking away from <PERSON>Runyan</PERSON> and Barve, she took the lead for good
<DATE>Monday</DATE> in the treacherous night-time crossing of 30 miles of ice
covering <LOCATION>Norton Bay</LOCATION>.
   Seven teams dropped out, and one team was disqualified.
   The remaining teams were strung out 600 miles back and will be
straggling into <LOCATION>Nome</LOCATION> for a week or more.

   <PERSON>Susan Butcher</PERSON>, bundled against biting winds
and subzero temperatures, widened her lead and seemed assured of an
unprecedented third straight victory in the 1,150-mile Iditarod
Trail Sled Dog Race.
   Butcher, who left this checkpoint just as her closest competitor
arrived <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, was expected to cross the finish line in <LOCATION>Nome</LOCATION>
today.
   If Butcher wins, it will be the fourth consecutive year that a
woman has won the 16-year-old race. <ORGANIZATION>Libby Riddles of Teller</ORGANIZATION> won in
<DATE>1985</DATE>, and Butcher won in <DATE>1986</DATE> and <DATE>1987</DATE>, setting a course record
each year.
   Butcher left Elim, 123 miles from <LOCATION>Nome</LOCATION>, at <TIME>5:11 p.m.</TIME> <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>,
after stopping in the <LOCATION>Eskimo</LOCATION> village for two hours to feed and rest
her dog team. <ORGANIZATION>Martin Buser of Big Lake</ORGANIZATION> arrived two minutes before
she left.
   Butcher, a resident of <ORGANIZATION>Manley</ORGANIZATION>, took the lead early <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> and
has not yielded it. She left Elim with 10 of the 17 dogs she
started with <DATE>March 5</DATE> in <LOCATION>Anchorage</LOCATION>; the others were dropped at
checkpoints along the trail.
   Buser was traveling with 12 of his original 20 dogs still in
harness.
   Subzero temperatures and biting winds continued to hinder the
leaders, and weather forecasters said the wind chill factor could
sink to minus 70 degrees along the trail's final miles.
   In each of her two previous victories, Butcher proved the
strength and endurance of her team in the final, windswept miles
along the barren <LOCATION>Bering Sea</LOCATION> coast. Her elapsed time last year was
11 days, 2 hours.
   Her closest rival last year was four-time Iditarod champion <PERSON>Rick
Swenson</PERSON> of Two <PERSON>Rivers</PERSON>, who ran neck-and-neck with Butcher until his
dogs refused to continue just 22 miles from the finish.
   This year, <PERSON>Swenson</PERSON> was about six hours behind Butcher at last
report, leaving <LOCATION>Koyuk</LOCATION> at <TIME>2 p.m.</TIME> <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> in third place. Running in
fourth was <PERSON>Joe Garnie</PERSON> of Teller.
   <PERSON>Herbie Nayokpuk</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Shishmaref</LOCATION> was fifth. Seventy-year-old <PERSON>Joe
Redington</PERSON> of Knik, who took an early lead and held it for more than
400 miles, was sixth.
   Redington, known as the ``Father of the Iditarod'' for
organizing the first race in <DATE>1973</DATE>, has run all but two races and
placed as high as fifth, but has yet to win.
   The first musher to <LOCATION>Nome</LOCATION> collects <MONEY>$30,000</MONEY> of a <MONEY>$150,000</MONEY> purse;
the next 19 finishers split the rest. Five of the 52 teams that
started the race have dropped out.

   Fighting warm temperatures and wet
snow, the leaders in the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race were out of
<ORGANIZATION>Finger Lake</ORGANIZATION> and on their way to Rainy Pass early today.
   Thirteen teams left the Finger Lake checkpoint, 193 miles from
the 1,158-mile race's starting line, in one hour late <DATE>Sunday</DATE>.
Twenty-three other teams had arrived at the checkpoint.
   <PERSON>Lavon Barve</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Wasilla</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Jerry Austin</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>St. Michael</ORGANIZATION> pulled
out at <TIME>7:39 p.m</TIME>. They were followed by <PERSON>DeeDee Jonrowe</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Bethel</LOCATION>,
<DATE>1987</DATE> champion <PERSON>Susan Butcher</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Manley</LOCATION>, four-time champion <PERSON>Rick
Swenson</PERSON> of Two <PERSON>Rivers</PERSON> and <PERSON>Tim Moerlein</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Kasilof</LOCATION>.
   Barve and <PERSON>Swenson</PERSON> had declared their 24-hour layovers, then
canceled the layover. All mushers are required to halt for one full
24 hour period during the race to rest themselves and their dogs.
   Temperatures in the Rainy Pass area were in the high 20s <DATE>early
today</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>National Weather Service</ORGANIZATION> reported. Temperatures that
hovered around 32 degrees on <DATE>Saturday</DATE> took a toll on many of the
sled dogs, which are accustomed to running in much colder weather.
   <PERSON>Herbie Nayokpuk</PERSON> was 18th into <LOCATION>Skwentna</LOCATION>, a checkpoint 148 miles
from <LOCATION>Anchorage</LOCATION>, and notified officials he would take the race's
mandatory 24-hour layover in <LOCATION>Skwentna</LOCATION>.
   ``I've got to save some of my dogs,'' he said. ``I almost burned
them up. I'll have to rest them a little bit.''
   When the lead mushers reach Puntilla Lake in Rainy Pass, they
will have covered 223 miles of the 1,158-mile race.
   Fifty-two teams started the race early <DATE>Saturday</DATE>. Defending
champion Butcher finished last year's race in a record 11 days, two
hours.
   The race is inspired by a <DATE>1925</DATE> dog sled relay that rushed
diphtheria serum to <LOCATION>Nome</LOCATION> during an outbreak of the disease. The top
20 mushers will split a purse of <MONEY>$150,000</MONEY>. The winner will get
<MONEY>$30,000</MONEY>.

   Sirens wailed and hundreds of boisterous
fans jammed the street to cheer <PERSON>Susan Butcher</PERSON> as she coasted to an
unprecedented third straight victory in the 1,150-mile Iditarod
Trail Sled Dog Race.
   Bitterly cold winds raked <LOCATION>Nome</LOCATION> as the flushed and perspiring
33-year-old Alaskan cruised beneath the log-arch finish at <TIME>8:42
p.m.</TIME> <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
   ``It means a lot to me to win three years in a row,'' said a
smiling <PERSON>Butcher</PERSON>, the only musher to win three consecutive
<LOCATION>Iditarods</LOCATION>, as she hugged her frosty-faced lead dogs, Granite and
<ORGANIZATION>Tolstoy</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``I very much want four,'' said <PERSON>Butcher</PERSON>, who has competed in 11

``I guess I want five.''
   Although the weather ``was pretty nasty,'' <PERSON>Butcher</PERSON> said <TIME>this
morning</TIME>, it was to her advantage ``because my dogs are good in that
type of conditions.''
   Butcher, who appeared with Granite on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning
America,'' said the dog ``came through with flying colors. He's got
to get a good bone for this one.''
   Butcher finished after 11 days, 11 hours, and 41 minutes, a
record for the race's longer northern route from <LOCATION>Anchorage</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Nome</LOCATION>.
Last year, her time of 11 days, 2 hours set a record for the
shorter southern route.
   Her closest rival, <ORGANIZATION>Martin Buser of Big Lake</ORGANIZATION>, trailed by 14 hours
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>.
   ``What gave me the jump on <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> was that storm we had <TIME>last
night</TIME>,'' <PERSON>Butcher</PERSON> said. ``I knew, when I heard we were going to have
winds, that was the best thing that could happen, because I knew
mine would pull through it.''
   Buser's team, she said, had balked in light winds earlier along
the coast. ``So I knew he couldn't make it through a storm,'' she
said. Wind and cold dropped the wind chill to minus 70 degrees.
   She said <PERSON>Buser</PERSON>, battling for second place with four-time
Iditarod champion <PERSON>Rick Swenson</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Two Rivers</ORGANIZATION>, will be a strong
contender if he races next year.
   <PERSON>Joe Garnie</PERSON> of Teller was running fourth <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>. <PERSON>Joe
Redington</PERSON>, a 70-year-old Knik resident known as ``the father of the
Iditarod'' for helping in <DATE>1973</DATE> to found the race he has never won,
was fifth.
   After the winner's take, the next 19 finishers will split
<MONEY>$120,000</MONEY> in prize money.
   People emptied out of bars and at least one church as Butcher
headed into this old gold-mining town, a regional hub for western
<LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION> whose population roughly doubled in recent days because of
the race.
   Butcher has won the Iditarod three times, finished second twice,
and finished among the top 10 four other times. She is the second
woman to win the Iditarod. Libby Riddles of Teller won the contest
in <DATE>1985</DATE>, the year Butcher was forced to drop out after an angry
moose stomped through her team.
   The Iditarod, named after an old supply route to the gold mining
districts of interior <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION>, draws its inspiration from a <DATE>1925</DATE>
relay of diphtheria serum to <LOCATION>Nome</LOCATION>, which was hit hard by an
outbreak of the disease.
   The race started <DATE>March 5</DATE> on trucked-in snow in downtown
<LOCATION>Anchorage</LOCATION>, and the temperature fluctuated around freezing the next
few days, which strained the cold-loving huskies. Then, fresh snow
slowed the leaders in the <ORGANIZATION>Alaska Range</ORGANIZATION>.
   Redington, who has entered all but two of the race's 16
runnings, has placed as high as fifth. For 400 miles, it seemed as
if he might finally win, but he lost the lead to Buser on the
frozen <LOCATION>Yukon River</LOCATION>.
   As the race reached the windblown <LOCATION>Bering Sea</LOCATION> coast, Butcher
quickly caught up. She passed <ORGANIZATION>Buser</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> near <LOCATION>Koyuk</LOCATION>, 171
miles from the finish.
   Five of the 52 teams that started the race have dropped out. The
remaining teams were strung 500 miles back along the trail and will
be straggling into <LOCATION>Nome</LOCATION> for a week or more.

   <PERSON>Joe Redington</PERSON> couldn't run in the first
Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race in <DATE>1973</DATE> because he was too busy
organizing the 1,100-mile marathon from <LOCATION>Anchorage</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Nome</LOCATION>.
   He missed out again in <DATE>1983</DATE> when a run-in with an angry moose
during training left him with a few cracked ribs.
   But <LOCATION>Redington</LOCATION>, now 70, has run in every other Iditarod, a
torturous test of people and dogs billed as ``The Last Great
Race.'' And as this year's race approached the midpoint near the
frozen <LOCATION>Yukon River</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Redington</LOCATION> was savoring the lead in a contest he
has never won.
   Redington, who has finished as high as fifth three times,
grabbed the lead <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> at <ORGANIZATION>Rohn</ORGANIZATION>, 271 miles from the start, and
held it until <DATE>Saturday</DATE> when he slipped into second place at the
<LOCATION>Yukon River</LOCATION> town of <LOCATION>Galena</LOCATION>, 452 miles from the finish.
   ``I feel like an old fox being chased by 50 young hounds,'' he
said.
   Redington earned the title ``Father of the Iditarod'' 16 years
ago when he spearheaded a movement to get Alaskans off snowmobiles
and back behind the dog teams that traditionally had provided
winter transportation across the vast state.
   To galvanize the mushing revival, he promoted an idea that many
thought impossible _ a race along the old <ORGANIZATION>Iditarod Trail</ORGANIZATION>, a supply
route used <DATE>earlier this century</DATE> to reach interior <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION> gold
mining districts.
   In <DATE>1925</DATE>, dog teams relayed diphtheria serum along the trail to
the epidemic-stricken community of <LOCATION>Nome</LOCATION> on <ORGANIZATION>Norton Sound</ORGANIZATION>.
   Using that historic relay for inspiration, 36 wary mushers set
out from <LOCATION>Anchorage</LOCATION> in <DATE>March 1973</DATE>. For the next month, the dog teams
struggled up into the glacier-ribbed <ORGANIZATION>Alaska Range</ORGANIZATION>, dropped into the
timbered interior, mushed down the frozen <ORGANIZATION>Yukon</ORGANIZATION>, then crossed over
to the wind-blown <LOCATION>Bering Sea</LOCATION> coast for a final limp into <LOCATION>Nome</LOCATION>.
   It was a macho event full of the <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION> mystique, and the men
who finished _ no women raced until <DATE>1975</DATE> _ were instant heroes in
<LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION>.
   Today, the race still bursts with a frontier aura. Rugged
mushers and their teams of 12 to 20 eager dogs brave blizzards,
wild animals, frostbite and 1,000 miles of sled-busting trail.
   But it's not quite so macho anymore.
   Since <DATE>1985</DATE>, when Libby Riddles ventured into a howling gale and
left the men behind, women have dominated the race.
   Riddles won that race, and <PERSON>Susan Butcher</PERSON> has won the last two,
setting a course record each time. Last <DATE>March</DATE>, she finished in 11
days, 2 hours, about half the time it took in <DATE>1973</DATE>.
   The fastest competitors have become mushing machines. Backed by
corporate sponsors and driving high-tech plastic sleds, they shave
hours from their race times by going without sleep for days. The
winner this year will get <MONEY>$30,000</MONEY>; the next 19 finishers will share
the rest of the <MONEY>$150,000</MONEY> purse.
   But even some of the leaders refuse to take things too seriously.
   Duane ``Dewey'' <PERSON>Halverson</PERSON>, a perennial contender, remembers the
days when many mushers regarded the Iditarod as an extended camping
trip.
   ``I think the competition is a little stiffer than it used to
be,'' he said in <PERSON>McGrath</PERSON> while his dogs rested on straw laid down
in the snow.
   ``We'll make it and have fun and see where we finish, and I'll
get one of those little teeny trophies this year.''
   Then he grinned and pronounced his own philosophy of racing dogs
across the <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION> wilds:
   ``I'm going to have fun if it kills me.''

   Workers strung a finish-line banner above Front
Street and installed wiring for TV crews as leaders in the Iditarod
Trail Sled Dog Race pressed toward <LOCATION>Nome</LOCATION>.
   ``There is no month of <DATE>March</DATE> in <LOCATION>Nome</LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON>Howard Farley</PERSON>, the
finish coordinator who competed in the first race in <DATE>1973</DATE>. ``It's
the month of Iditarod.''
   The annual 1,168-mile race brings excitement, attention and money
to this town of 4,300 people, and residents have been readying for
the onslaught of mushers, spectators and news teams since
competitors left <LOCATION>Anchorage</LOCATION> <DATE>March 4</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Susan Butcher</PERSON>, who has won the race the last three years, today
struggled to hold off <PERSON>Joe Runyan</PERSON> and <PERSON>Rick Swenson</PERSON> after regaining
the lead from <PERSON>Runyan</PERSON> late <DATE>Monday</DATE>.
   ``My dogs love it; they're getting stronger all the time,''
<PERSON>Butcher</PERSON> said in <LOCATION>Kouyk</LOCATION>, 171 miles from the finish line. She arrived
31 minutes ahead of <PERSON>Runyan</PERSON> but left with only a nine-minute lead.
Swenson left <LOCATION>Koyuk</LOCATION> 53 minutes behind Butcher.
   Barring a change in the calm weather that mushers have enjoyed
since the race began <DATE>March 4</DATE>, the winner should reach <LOCATION>Nome</LOCATION> sometime
early <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> _ perhaps in time to beat Butcher's record of
slightly more than 11 days.
   The progress has been charted by the community's two radio
stations, both of which sent reporters on the trail.
   ``We tend to go into overdrive about a week before the race
starts,'' said <PERSON>Tom Busch</PERSON>, manager of KNOM and a member of the
<ORGANIZATION>Iditarod Trail Committee</ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors.
   Other workers have been busy with chores such as getting
permission to use the <ORGANIZATION>Volunteer Fire Department</ORGANIZATION>'s Christmas lights
and testing the municipal siren that heralds the arrival of each
musher.
   ``Everybody's a hero when he finishes the Iditarod race here in
<LOCATION>Nome</LOCATION>,'' <PERSON>Farley</PERSON> said.
   Most of the work is carried out by volunteers, although inmates
from the <ORGANIZATION>Anvil Mountain Correctional Center</ORGANIZATION> have helped install the
sled chute at the finish, <LOCATION>City</LOCATION> manager <PERSON>Polly Prchal</PERSON> said.
   ``It's a very appreciated, welcome and needed break for us,''
said <PERSON>Patti James</PERSON>, operator of a downtown stoe. ``With the arrival of
the Iditarod and the <ORGANIZATION>Iditarod Basketball Tournament</ORGANIZATION>, the mood picks
up and the economy surges,'' she said.
   Tourism officials estimate the two events bring 2,000 people to
<LOCATION>Nome</LOCATION>.
   The city's two hotels and bed-and-breakfast facilities are
booked. Poeple who arrive without lodging are advised to check homes
where sleeping-bag space and the use of a bathroom cost <MONEY>$25</MONEY> a night.
   ``We never turn people away,'' <PERSON>Farley</PERSON> said. ``If people ever get
the idea that we don't have room, they won't come up.''

<HEAD>Butcher Wins Her Record Third Straight Iditarod</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NOME, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three-time <ORGANIZATION>Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race</ORGANIZATION>
winner <PERSON>Susan Butcher</PERSON> is shooting for a fourth victory next year,
saying she can whittle a day off her record time to cover the 1,150
mile-course in just 10 days.
   ``I think it can be done, and I want to be the one to do it,''
she said.
   Butcher left her nearest competitor miles behind on the
windblown <LOCATION>Bering Sea</LOCATION> coast <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> to breeze into the
record books with her third straight victory.
   The 33-year-old musher charged down Front Street in this old
gold mining town at <TIME>8:42 p.m.</TIME> (AST) <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>. She covered the
storm-wracked course from <LOCATION>Anchorage</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Nome</LOCATION> in 11 days, 11 hours,
and 41 minutes.
   Her elapsed time _ the actual time on the course minus the time
spent on mandatory breaks _ set a record for the race's longer,
more arduous northern route. She broke her own record set in <DATE>1986</DATE>.
And last year she set the record for the southern route.
   ``It means a lot to me to win three years in a row,'' said the
flushed and perspiring musher. ``But the win doesn't mean as much
to me as knowing the dogs were able to do it.''
   Race officials presented her dog team's leaders, Granite and
<ORGANIZATION>Tolstoy</ORGANIZATION>, with wreaths of plastic yellow roses. They said real roses
would have wilted quickly in the 10-degree temperature fanned by
30-mph winds.
   The dogs, ice hanging from their muzzles, appeared perplexed by
the glaring television lights and the press of the crowd chanting
``<PERSON>Susan</PERSON>, <PERSON>Susan</PERSON>.''
   She was met by her husband, <PERSON>Dave Monson</PERSON>, who won the 1,000-mile
<ORGANIZATION>Yukon Quest International Sled Dog Race</ORGANIZATION> earlier this month.
   Butcher received <MONEY>$30,000</MONEY> for winning, down from last year's top
prize of <MONEY>$50,000</MONEY>. The financial problems of the race committee
during the past year caused her winning check last year to bounce,
although she eventually collected all her money.
   Butcher held an unthreatened lead since <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, when she blew
by <ORGANIZATION>Martin Buser</ORGANIZATION> 171 miles from <LOCATION>Nome</LOCATION>.
   She said she would be back for the 17th annual Iditarod next
year, but added she might give up the 200- and 300-mile
intermediate races she ran this year.
   ``It's been a long year,'' she said.
   Only one other musher, <PERSON>Rick Swenson</PERSON>, has ever won the race four
times. Butcher and <PERSON>Swenson</PERSON> are the only ones in 16 years ever to
win more than once.

<LEADPARA>  ONCE a vital part of Alaskans' way of life, dog mushing -- what Alaskans call
their official state sport -- is what the rest of us call dog racing. But
describing it as a sport is like saying Romeo and Juliet were nodding
acquaintances.;    The racing season from January to April is big business for
some, an obsession for more than a few and an increasingly powerful lure to
travelers who like winter sports and the color and excitement of racing.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Attention centers on four contests.;    Two of the most prestigious and
accessible races start in mountain-and-sea-ringed <LOCATION>Anchorage</LOCATION>: the World
Championship Sled Dog Race (this weekend during the Fur Rendezvous or "Rondy,"
as Alaskans call it); and the world-famous Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race
(starting <DATE>March 2</DATE> at <TIME>9 a.m.</TIME>), a grueling 1,150-miler to <LOCATION>Nome</LOCATION>. The two events
attract 50,000 spectators.;    Fairbanks hosts two other sled dog contests,
the finish of the 1,000-mile Yukon Quest International Sled Dog Race (March
8-11), which starts <DATE>Feb. 24</DATE> in <LOCATION>Whitehorse</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Yukon Territory</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>; and the
<LOCATION>Alascom</LOCATION> Open North American Championship Sled Dog Race (<DATE>March 15-17</DATE> during the
annual Winter Carnival).;    Mushers get addicted to hanging on for dear life
as a team of 45-pound dogs streaks down streets lined with noisy onlookers or
through silent woods and around corners with only a "gee" or a "haw" to guide
them. Crowds love the excitement of photo finishes such as <DATE>1978</DATE>'s Iditarod,
when <PERSON>Dick Mackey</PERSON> came into <LOCATION>Nome</LOCATION> only one second ahead of <PERSON>Rich Swenson</PERSON> after 14
days, 18 hours, 52 minutes and 24 seconds on the trail.;    Fur Rendezvous; 
It was not the thrill of a photo finish that motivated organizers of the first
Fur Rendezvous in <DATE>1936</DATE>. Back then, it was merely a cure for Alaskans' cabin
fever and, in addition to the fur auction, consisted only of a festival queen,
four or five sports events and a one-dog children's sled race. But in <DATE>1946</DATE>,
<PERSON>Earl Norris</PERSON>, a Siberian husky breeder, had an adult open-class sled dog race
added. Only three teams entered, so they split the <MONEY>$170</MONEY> purse three ways.;   
Since then the <PERSON>Rondy</PERSON> has grown, and this year, a small staff of paid workers
and about 5,000 volunteers put on a world-class, million-dollar celebration
and fur auction with 150 events.;    The World Championship Sled Dog Race is
one of three dog races run during the Rondy. It combines times of three
successive 25-mile heats for a <MONEY>$50,000</MONEY> purse.;    <ORGANIZATION>Iditarod;  Trail</ORGANIZATION> manager
<PERSON>Jack Niggemyer</PERSON> says of the 4-foot-wide, 1,150-mile-long <ORGANIZATION>Iditarod Trail</ORGANIZATION> that
"it's my job to lay it down and maintain it with no sharp corners and no holes
in the ice.";    For "outsiders" -- what Alaskans call everybody else -- the
designated "Last Great Race on Earth" from <LOCATION>Anchorage</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Nome</LOCATION> has become the
most prestigious and fascinating distance sled dog race in the world.;    It's
a far cry from <DATE>1964</DATE>, when <LOCATION>Wasilla</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION>, historian <PERSON>Dorothy Page</PERSON> suggested
opening the old mail and supply route from Knik to <LOCATION>Nome</LOCATION> -- via the interior
towns of Flat, <PERSON>Ophir</PERSON> and Iditarod -- to mark the 100th anniversary of the
<LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION> purchase from <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> in <DATE>1867</DATE>. Page was asked a good question: Why would
anyone support an unknown race over a trail overgrown and unused for 50 years
through a town (Iditarod) that wasn't there anymore?;    Nonetheless, by the
centennial year, <DATE>1967</DATE>, nine miles of trail had been opened from Knik to <LOCATION>Big
Lake</LOCATION> for the first Iditarod race. Fifty-eight mushers competed for a <MONEY>$25,000</MONEY>
purse, the largest in <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION> up to that time.;    It wasn't until <DATE>1973</DATE> that
the first Anchorage-to-Nome Iditarod race was run. <PERSON>Dick Wilmarth</PERSON> took 20 days
to beat 33 other mushers for his share of the <MONEY>$50,000</MONEY> purse.;    Since then
the race time has been gradually whittled. Last year, <PERSON>Susan Butcher</PERSON> beat her
own <DATE>1987</DATE> record with a time of about 11 days and 1 hour to become the second
four-time winner in the <LOCATION>Iditarod</LOCATION>'s history.;    The race runs south through
Iditarod in odd-numbered years and north through <ORGANIZATION>Ruby</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Galena</LOCATION> in
even-numbered years. Teams cross mountain ranges, frozen rivers and dense
forests, desolate tundra and miles of windswept coast on the <LOCATION>Bering Sea.</LOCATION>;   
The <MONEY>$250,000</MONEY> purse awards <MONEY>$50,000</MONEY> to first place and lesser amounts to the
next 19 finishers. Finishers from 20th on get <MONEY>$1,000</MONEY> each. The entry fee is
<MONEY>$1,249</MONEY>, and close to 60 teams enter.;    <ORGANIZATION>Yukon Quest</ORGANIZATION>;  In seven years, the
<ORGANIZATION>Yukon Quest International Sled Dog Race</ORGANIZATION> has earned a reputation as the
toughest race in the north. Fierce winds, steep summits, long distances
between checkpoints and a wilderness trail indistinct and easy to lose under
blizzardy drifts challenge the contestants. Mushers are required to take a
36-hour rest midway along the trail at Dawson.;    The quest, which runs from
<LOCATION>Whitehorse</LOCATION> to <ORGANIZATION>Fairbanks</ORGANIZATION> in odd-numbered years, got started because of the high
cost of running in the <LOCATION>Iditarod</LOCATION>. In <DATE>1984</DATE>, 24 mushers competed for a <MONEY>$50,000</MONEY>
purse. <PERSON>Sonny Linder</PERSON> won in 12 days and 5 minutes and collected <MONEY>$15,000</MONEY>.;   
The race costs <MONEY>$650</MONEY> to enter and is limited to 50 teams of 8-12 dogs so
smaller kennels can enter.;    Now, the <MONEY>$75,000</MONEY> purse pays <MONEY>$20,000</MONEY> to first
place and cash to the next 14 finishers. In <DATE>1990</DATE>, <PERSON>Vern Halter</PERSON>'s winning time
was 11 days, 17 hours and 9 minutes.;    The quest attracts mushers who laugh
at adversity. In <DATE>1989</DATE>, the race achieved new infamy. Seven leader teams broke
through the <LOCATION>Yukon River</LOCATION> ice in 60 degrees below zero weather and were dubbed
the <ORGANIZATION>Yukon Quest Swim Team.</ORGANIZATION>;    <LOCATION>Alascom</LOCATION> Open;  The days will be longer <DATE>March
15-17</DATE> for the <ORGANIZATION>Alascom Open North American Championship</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Fairbanks</LOCATION>. The
62-year-old speed race starts in town, drops down onto the frozen <LOCATION>Chena River</LOCATION>
and then loops north back to the starting line. The purse is <MONEY>$46,000</MONEY>, and
heats of 20, 20 and 30 miles run on successive days.;  If you go . . .;   
(check) Weather -- High temperatures in Fairbanks average minus 4 degrees in
<DATE>February</DATE> and 8.4 degrees in <DATE>March</DATE>, and in <LOCATION>Anchorage</LOCATION> 26 degrees in <DATE>February</DATE> and
34 degrees in <DATE>March</DATE>. Wear layers of clothing: longsleeve shirts, sweaters and
a winter coat, plus warm boots and gloves.;    (check) GETTING THERE --
<LOCATION>Anchorage</LOCATION> is served by 17 airlines with about 100 flights daily; <ORGANIZATION>Fairbanks</ORGANIZATION> has
direct flights from <LOCATION>Seattle</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Anchorage</LOCATION>; <LOCATION>Nome</LOCATION> is served by <ORGANIZATION>Alaska Airlines</ORGANIZATION>

   <PERSON>Lavon Barve</PERSON> won <MONEY>$3,000</MONEY> in silver ingots
and the halfway trophy at this wilderness checkpoint, more than a
half-hour ahead of defending champion <PERSON>Joe Runyan</PERSON> in the 18th annual
Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race.
   Barve arrived at the official halfway checkpoint at 10:57 p.m.
   <PERSON>Runyan</PERSON> was followed by three-time winner <PERSON>Susan Butcher</PERSON>, <PERSON>Dee Dee
Jonrowe</PERSON>, <PERSON>Robin Jacobson</PERSON>, <PERSON>Martin Buser</PERSON>, <PERSON>Rick Swenson</PERSON>, the Iditarod's
only four-time champion, and <PERSON>Tim Osmar</PERSON>.
   Seventy teams left <LOCATION>Anchorage</LOCATION> <DATE>last Saturday</DATE> to compete in the
1,160-mile endurance run across mountains, wind-swept rivers,
Arctic Ocean ice and treeless tundra.
   The silver ingots awarded the first musher to reach the official
halfway point have become something of a jinx. Only once since the
race was organized in <DATE>1973</DATE> has the winner of the halfway money held
on to win the race.
   The Iditarod, named for a tiny ghost town along the route,
commemorates the <DATE>1925</DATE> emergency delivery by dog teams of
life-saving diphtheria serum to <LOCATION>Nome</LOCATION>.
   The race in past years has taken from 11 to 18 days to complete.

   Three-time winner <PERSON>Susan Butcher</PERSON> pushed into
the lead of the <ORGANIZATION>Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race</ORGANIZATION> again today during the
treacherous crossing of ice-covered <ORGANIZATION>Norton Sound</ORGANIZATION> on the <LOCATION>Bering Sea</LOCATION>.
   And after a short rest she and her team took off on the final
171 miles of the 11,058-mile race from <LOCATION>Anchorage</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Nome</LOCATION>.
   Race observers expect the winner to reach <LOCATION>Nome</LOCATION> on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>
<TIME>evening</TIME>. Of the 70 teams that began the race in <LOCATION>Anchorage</LOCATION> on <DATE>March
3</DATE>, seven have scratched and another was disqualified because of
sick dogs.
   Butcher left the Shaktoolik checkpoint late <DATE>Monday</DATE> eight minutes
behind defending champion <PERSON>Joe Runyan</PERSON>, but had passed him by the end
of the nighttime 30-mile ice crossing today and had built a
55-minute lead.
   The mushers head out onto the ice of <ORGANIZATION>Norton Sound</ORGANIZATION> trying to save
time and miles, but it is one of the most dangerous segments of the
race. Open water leads in the ice can force time-consuming detours,
or swallow an unwary team.
   ``Once they get onto the (<LOCATION>Bering Sea</LOCATION>) ice, they can expect
sudden storms and an ample supply of wind,'' <PERSON>Gail Somerville</PERSON>, an
Iditarod spokeswoman in <LOCATION>Anchorage</LOCATION>, said <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>.
   Named for an abandoned gold-mining town along the trail, the
Iditarod was started in <DATE>1973</DATE> to commemorate the <DATE>1925</DATE> emergency
delivery of life-saving diphtheria serum from <LOCATION>Anchorage</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Nome</LOCATION> by
sled dog teams.
   The winner will get <MONEY>$50,000</MONEY> and the rest of a <MONEY>$200,000</MONEY> purse
will be split among the next 19 finishers.
