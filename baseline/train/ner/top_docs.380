   An American tropical insect expert
faces a possible prison term in <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> for backing native Indians
trying to stop the building of hydroelectric dams that could flood
their tribal lands in the <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Darrell Posey</PERSON>, 41, a native of <LOCATION>Henderson</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ky.</LOCATION>, who holds a Ph.D.
from the <ORGANIZATION>University of Georgia</ORGANIZATION>, has been charged by <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>'s federal
police under a law that prohibits foreigners from ``getting involved
in internal Brazilian affairs'' and ``denigrating the country's
image.'' The maximum penalty is three years in prison, followed by
expulsion.
   Authorities also have forbidden the stocky, bearded, soft-spoken
naturalist from entering certain areas inhabited by native tribes
with which he has worked since <DATE>1977</DATE>. And, under the threat of
dismissal from his Brazilian government job as a professor-level
researcher for the <ORGANIZATION>National Research Council</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Posey</PERSON> is barred from
leaving <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>.
   ``The <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> jungle is being destroyed at an a alarming rate,''
<PERSON>Posey</PERSON> recently told a group of foreign correspondents in <LOCATION>Rio de
Janeiro</LOCATION>. ``Meanwhile, native Indians have lived in the <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> for
20,000 years in perfect coexistence with the environment. I'm trying
to call serious attention to the native philosophy for preserving
ecology.
   ``How can that be considered subversive?''
   <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> traditionally has eyed the vast hydroelectric potential of
the <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> as a way to expand its already sophisticated industrial
base, situated mostly in the southern part of the country.
   Posey irked Brazilian authorities when earlier this year he took
two chiefs of the <LOCATION>Kayapo</LOCATION> tribe to a seminar at the <ORGANIZATION>University of
Florida</ORGANIZATION> where they spoke against reported government hydroelectric
projects in the <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> and then to <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> where they repeated
their views to the <ORGANIZATION>World Bank</ORGANIZATION>, which frequently helps finance such
projects.
   ``It was the first time outsiders got to hear the Indians' side
of the <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> development story,'' <PERSON>Posey</PERSON> said. Chiefs Kube-i and
<PERSON>Paulinho Paiakan</PERSON>, wearing native headdresses and collars and jungle
body paint, addressed their <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> hosts in Portuguese, <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>'s
official language, and <PERSON>Posey</PERSON> translated.
   In an inexplicable move, the government also indicted the
Indians, who were born in <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> and never had been out of the
country before, for violating the Foreigners Law.
   ``The charges against the Indians have no legal basis. We'll get
the accusations thrown out,'' said <PERSON>Jose Carlos Castro</PERSON>, a lawyer in
the Amazon-delta city of <LOCATION>Belem</LOCATION>, where <PERSON>Posey</PERSON> is based. ``The real
purpose is to intimidate Professor <PERSON>Posey</PERSON> and make him shut up.''
   ``This is purely political,'' added <PERSON>Castro</PERSON>, who along with Kube-i
and Paiakan, also met with foreign reporters.
   ``We tried to get information about dams from our own
government,'' said <PERSON>Paiakan</PERSON>. ``But they wouldn't tell us anything.
They treated us like children. So we went to the <ORGANIZATION>World Bank</ORGANIZATION>, and it
turned out they didn't know much about these projects. Now they do.''
   Federal power officials deny claims by radical environmentalists
that they have a ``secret plan'' to build 26 hydroelectric dams
along <LOCATION>Amazon River</LOCATION> tributaries where Indians from 11 tribes,
including the 8,500-member Kaiapos, live, fish and hunt in
relatively untouched primitive conditions.
   Of the estimated 5 million Indians here when Portuguese explorers
discovered <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> in <DATE>1500</DATE>, only around 250,000 remain, in an
over-all population of 144 million. Anthropologists have expressed
fears about the Indians' continued survival, as hundreds of
thousands of non-Indian homesteaders, ranchers and prospectors
stream into the <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> annually, chopping and burning away the
rainforest and ignoring demarcations of native tribal areas.
   ``There have been a lot of gossip and rumors about hydroelectric
plans in the <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION>,'' <PERSON>Diomedes Ferreira Jr.</PERSON>, the spokesman for a
government Amazonian power company called Eletronorte (cq
Eletronorte), said in <LOCATION>Brasilia</LOCATION>, the capital. ``We have looked into
only six potential dam sites, and we're talking about projects that
wouldn't be carried out until well into the <DATE>21st century</DATE>.''
   ``The government will do everything possible to protect the
environment and the Indians,'' <PERSON>Ferreira</PERSON> said.
   Meanwhile _ and without saying whether the Indians' sudden high
profile had anything to do with it _ the government says it has
shelved plans for a proposed dam known as Babaquara on the <LOCATION>Xingu
River</LOCATION>, a major <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> tributary that passes through the <LOCATION>Kayapo</LOCATION>
lands. Its reservoir would have covered 2,300 square miles, twice
the size of <LOCATION>Rhode Island</LOCATION>. <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> had intended to ask the <ORGANIZATION>World Bank</ORGANIZATION>
to finance it.
   Now, says <PERSON>Ferreira</PERSON>, the only Xingu dam under possible
consideration is one called <PERSON>Kararao</PERSON>, with a reservoir one-fifth the
size of that of Babaquara.
   The <ORGANIZATION>World Bank</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> said construction of the 11
million-kilowatt Kararao installation _ nearly twice as large as
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>'s Grand Coulee Dam, the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>' biggest _ could
not begin until <DATE>1991</DATE> or <DATE>1992</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Ferreira</PERSON> said, ``So far we're talking only about hydroelectric
potential feasibility studies. We're not saying Kararao will be
built. But even if it is, there wouldn't be another dam in that
region before <DATE>2010</DATE>.''
   Nonetheless, a <ORGANIZATION>Kayapo Legal Fund</ORGANIZATION>, partially coordinated by <PERSON>Posey</PERSON>,
has been set up at the <ORGANIZATION>University of California</ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION>Berkeley</LOCATION>, to keep
an eye on the <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> dam situation.
   The Kayapos plan to call a multitribal meeting of up to 5,000
Indians in late <DATE>January</DATE> to discuss the overall problem of <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION>
development projects.
   ``The Indians are serious,'' said <PERSON>Posey</PERSON>. ``The problem is that
hardly anyone takes them seriously _ and they have so much to teach
us.''

<HEAD>Court Suspends Trial Of Indians And American</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge has suspended the trial of
two Indian chiefs and a American who were charged with criticizing
<LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> during a trip to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, an official said
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
   Federal <PERSON>Judge Milton Luiz Pereira</PERSON> on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> halted the trial of
American <PERSON>Darrell Posey</PERSON> and chiefs Kube-I and <PERSON>Paulo Paiakan</PERSON> because
of ``unsound accusations and a lack of just cause,'' <PERSON>Claudia de
Oliveira</PERSON>, an official in the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Appeals Court</ORGANIZATION>, said by
telephone from <LOCATION>Brasilia</LOCATION>.
   Kube-I and <PERSON>Paiakan</PERSON>, both of the <LOCATION>Kayapo</LOCATION> tribe, and <PERSON>Posey</PERSON>, 41, a
native of <LOCATION>Henderson</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ky.</LOCATION>, and an expert on tropical insects, were
accused of breaking <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>'s foreigners law during a trip last year
to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, where they denounced the white man's
encroachment upon Indian lands in <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>.
   Brazilian law prohibits foreigners from making political
statements or interfering in the country's legal affairs.
   The trial caused a sensation in <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> because it marked the
first time native Indians had been legally considered foreigners.
Legally, <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>'s 220,000 Indians are wards of the state and do not
have the full rights of other citizens.
   Pereira ordered the trial suspended because Kube-I and Paiakan
were found to be ``native Brazilians recognized by the federal
constitution'' and because <PERSON>Posey</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> resident, proved he had
acted solely as a language interpreter when the remarks were made,
de <PERSON>Oliveira</PERSON> said.
   The court's action appeared to be an attempt by the government to
back off the controversial case. De Oliveira would not comment on
why the judge suspended the trial instead of simply throwing the
charges out.
   He said the proceedings could be renewed but the possibility of
that was ``very, very unlikely.''
   The trial began in <DATE>August</DATE> in <LOCATION>Belem</LOCATION>, capital of the northern
<LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> jungle state of Para.
   The Brazilian government charged the <LOCATION>Kayapo</LOCATION> chiefs and <PERSON>Posey</PERSON> with
illegal political activities after they spoke at <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Florida
International University</ORGANIZATION> about forest conservation. <PERSON>Posey</PERSON> said he
attended the forum as a friend and interpreter for the chiefs.
   Soon after the forum, environmental groups invited Paiakan and
Kube-I to speak to the <ORGANIZATION>World Bank</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, where they
criticized deforestation in the <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> jungle, erosion, mercury
pollution from gold mining, and the construction of hydroelectric
projects that caused flooding in low-lying jungle areas and
displaced Indian tribes.
   Later, the <ORGANIZATION>World Bank</ORGANIZATION> held back funds for the Xingu hydroelectric
project, which would have inundated an estimated 18.8 million acres
of mostly Indian land.
   Many Brazilian observers credited the <LOCATION>Kayapo</LOCATION> chiefs with blocking
the project.
   But <PERSON>Posey</PERSON>, also a federal researcher in the <ORGANIZATION>Brazilian National
Research Council</ORGANIZATION>, said funding had been suspended because of
financing problems with the government power company Eletronorte.

<HEAD>Amazon Tribes Join Against Dams that Would Flood Their Lands</HEAD>
<UNK>By PETER MUELLO ^Associated Press Writer</UNK>
<DATELINE>ALTAMIRA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of Indians, painted for war and
representing tribes of the <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION>, began a historic effort <DATE>Monday</DATE> to
stop the government from building two hydroelectric dams that would
flood native lands.
   It is the first time diverse tribes from the vast <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> rain
forest have joined in a political movement.
   ``We will bring Indian peoples together, to fight,'' said Chief
Sebirop of the Gaviao tribe. ``We will not accept the dams. Where
will we live? What will we eat?''
   He and the others oppose construction of the Kararao and
Babaquara dams on the <LOCATION>Xingu River</LOCATION>, a major <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> tributary, which
would flood an estimated 3,000 square miles of rain forest and
displace 7,000 Indians.
   Thousands of pro-dam demonstrators in trucks, cars and on
horseback paraded through the streets of this remote jungle town
carrying signs reading ``The dams mean more jobs and more progress''
and ``Gringos leave us in peace.'' Airplanes with banners carrying
similar slogans buzzed overhead.
   <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> has about 220,000 Indians in a total population of 144
million. Historians say the number has declined from about 5 million
when Portuguese explorers landed in <DATE>1500</DATE>.
   Tribes along the Xingu face opposition from government and
industry, which say the power the dams would generate is vital to
economic growth.
   About 500 Indian men, women and children from more than 20 tribes
attended the opening session of the conference <DATE>Monday</DATE> at a brick
community center in this city of 38,000 people 2,000 miles northwest
of <ORGANIZATION>Rio de Janeiro</ORGANIZATION>.
   Included were 100 warriors from the <LOCATION>Kayapo</LOCATION> tribe, the main
organizer of the gathering. They ran into the center chanting,
wearing green-and-yellow feathered headdresses and daubed with red
and black war paint.
   They circled in a ritual dance, then put palm ronds on the
concrete floor and sat. Kayapo women carrying machetes, many with
young children, sat around the group.
   Whites predominated in the crowd packing the concrete bleachers
and the auditorium's balcony. They cheered and applauded as each
tribal delegation arrived.
   Brazilian and foreign environmentalists were among the onlookers.
Foreign organizations represented included the <ORGANIZATION>Environmental Defense
Fund</ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, and Friends of the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, which has its
headquarters in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>.
   Chiefs stepped onto a wooden platform in turn and spoke about the
dams.
   ``We want the goverment to rethink the dams, said <PERSON>Jorge Terena</PERSON> of
the <ORGANIZATION>Terena</ORGANIZATION> tribe. ``The land is sacred to us. It has the roots of
our culture and our ancestors. The electricity won't benefit
Indians, only whites and their industries.''
   <PERSON>David Yanomami</PERSON> of the primitive <ORGANIZATION>Yanomami</ORGANIZATION> tribe that recently won
a <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> ``Global 500 '' award for defense of the environmental
defense, took the platform and declared: ``We will not accept the
dams. The river will rise. The fish will die. The game will move
away.''
   All the chiefs spoke in Portuguese, <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>'s national language,
sometimes with accents and imperfect grammar.
   Some Kayapos made a videotape of the meeting to replay for their
villages.
   The Indians invited President <PERSON>Jose Sarney</PERSON> and ranking Cabinet
ministers to the meeting, but the government sent <PERSON>Fernando Mesquita</PERSON>,
president of the <ORGANIZATION>Brazilian Environment Institute</ORGANIZATION>.
   Boos and whistles came from the crowd when <PERSON>Mesquita</PERSON> said: ``We
recognize that great indignities were committed against the Indian
people, but now it is a question of national awareness. We are here
to listen.''
   Sarney, who was out of the country <DATE>Monday</DATE>, has said he favors
protecting of Indians and the <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> environment but does not want
foreigners telling him how.
   The government has temporarily shelved plans for the Babaquara
dam but is actively studying the Kararao project, which is intended
to produce 11 million kilowatts.
   Officials say work on Kararao could start in the early <DATE>1990s</DATE>.
<LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> has approached the <ORGANIZATION>World Bank</ORGANIZATION> about partial financing.
   Environmentalists are trying to discourage the bank and other
international lending institutions from putting money into Third
World development projects considered harmful to the environment or
native peoples.

   A <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> anthropologist and two
<LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> Indian chiefs were arraigned <DATE>Friday</DATE> on charges of engaging
in illegal political activities and could be expelled from <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Darrell Posey</PERSON>, 41, of <LOCATION>Henderson</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ky.</LOCATION>, and chiefs <PERSON>Paulo Paiakan</PERSON>
and Kube-I of the <LOCATION>Kayapo</LOCATION> tribe were accused of breaking <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>'s
Foreigners Law during a trip to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> this year.
   The law, passed in <DATE>1980</DATE> when <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> was under a military
government, prohibits non-Brazilian residents or visitors from
speaking out publicly on domestic political issues.
   The trial has caused a sensation here. It is first time native
Indians have been legally considered foreigners.
   Posey's lawyer, well-known human rights defender <PERSON>Jose Carlos
Castro</PERSON>, said <DATE>Friday</DATE> the trial was suspended ``at least until
<DATE>December</DATE>'' because Kube-I had returned to his village for the
harvest and festival period and refused to show up at court.
   The court gave Kube-I 90 days to present himself for arraignment.
   ``This is a landmark case. I've been studying native peoples for
24 years, and this is the first time a native group has been
considered foreign by a white government,'' <PERSON>Posey</PERSON> said by telephone
from his office in <LOCATION>Belem</LOCATION>, a city at the mouth of the <LOCATION>Amazon River</LOCATION>
2,140 miles northwest of <ORGANIZATION>Rio de Janeiro</ORGANIZATION>.
   He said the two <LOCATION>Kayapo</LOCATION> chiefs were invited by <ORGANIZATION>Florida
International University</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> to speak about forest
conservation. <PERSON>Posey</PERSON>, who has lived and worked in <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> since <DATE>1977</DATE>,
said he went along as a friend and interpreter.
   ``They (the two Indians) said they were worried about
deforestation in the <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION>, erosion, mercury pollution from gold
mining, and hydroelectric projects that displace Indian tribes.
They're especially upset at the Xingu project that will inundate
about ... (18.8 million acres) of land, mostly Indian territory,''
<PERSON>Posey</PERSON> said.
   The Kayapos number about 5,500 and live in the southern <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION>
jungle.
   Environmental groups later invited Paiakan and Kube-I to speak
to the <ORGANIZATION>World Bank</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>. The bank suspended funding for the
Xingu project.
   Many Brazilians believe the Indians were responsible for
blocking the project, but <PERSON>Posey</PERSON> said funding already had been
suspended because of financing problems with the government power
company Eletronorte.
   The trial began <DATE>Friday</DATE> in <LOCATION>Belem</LOCATION> at the <ORGANIZATION>3rd Federal Court of
Para</ORGANIZATION>, a northern <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> jungle state. If found guilty, the three
face a prison term of up to three years each and expulsion from
<LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>.
   It was not clear where the Indians could be expelled to.
   ``That's a very interesting question. But it's the government's
problem,'' <PERSON>Posey</PERSON> said.
   Legally, Indians are wards of the state and don't have the full
rights of other citizens.
   <PERSON>Posey</PERSON> said he felt the trial was an attempt by the government to
intimidate scientists and native Indians and keep them from
speaking out on politically sensitive issues.
   ``No matter what the outcome of the trial is, the effects will
be very unpleasant. I am prohibited from working in any Indian area
as long as the case is pending. My work is paralyzed,'' he said.
   The Foreigners Law was enacted and often used by the military
governments that ruled <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> from <DATE>1964</DATE> to <DATE>1985</DATE>. Foreign priests
and students who spoke out about political affairs were charged and
sometimes expelled from the country.
   However, this is the first time the law has been used since
<LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> returned to civilian rule in <DATE>1985</DATE> under President <PERSON>Jose
Sarney</PERSON>.
   <PERSON>Posey</PERSON> said he wasn't afraid of being expelled.
   ``If I'm found guilty ... I wouldn't want to stay here any
more.''

   More than 350 <ORGANIZATION>Amazon Indians</ORGANIZATION>
wearing loincloths and warpaint protested <DATE>Friday</DATE> outside a
courthouse where their chief appeared for a hearing on alleged
illegal political activities, a lawyer said.
   Federal <PERSON>Judge Iran Velasco</PERSON> do Nascimento canceled the hearing
because chief Kube-I appeared before the court in a loincloth,
which the judge said was disrespectful, said Kube-I's lawyer, <PERSON>Jose
Carlos Castro</PERSON>.
   Kube-I, chief <PERSON>Paulo Paiakan</PERSON>, both of the <LOCATION>Kayapo</LOCATION> tribe, and <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
anthropologist <PERSON>Darrell Posey</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Henderson</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ky.</LOCATION>, are accused of
breaking <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>'s foreigners law, which bans foreigners from making
political statements or interfering in <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>'s internal affairs.
   During a trip to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> <DATE>earlier this year</DATE>, the three
complained about the white man's encroachment upon Indian lands.
   The trial, which began in late <DATE>August</DATE>, has caused a sensation
because it is the first time native Indians have been legally
considered foreigners.
   At the hearing in <LOCATION>Belem</LOCATION>, 2,140 miles northwest of <ORGANIZATION>Rio de Janeiro</ORGANIZATION>
in the northern <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> jungle state of <ORGANIZATION>Para</ORGANIZATION>, Kube-I told the judge
that as chief of his tribe he has never worn a suit and tie and
refused to begin doing so now, <PERSON>Castro</PERSON> said.
   ``The judge then said Kube-I's decision to wear his tribal
clothes to the hearing was disrespectful and said the hearing was
no longer necessary,'' <PERSON>Castro</PERSON> said.
   Outside the courthouse, <PERSON>Castro</PERSON> said, more than 350 Kayapo
Indians in loincloths and green and yellow warpaint danced, chanted
tribal songs and shot arrows into nearby trees as they protested
the hearing. They were surrounded by heavily armed federal police
and more than 1,000 onlookers.
   <PERSON>Castro</PERSON> said he would file a petition to drop charges against the
two <LOCATION>Kayapo</LOCATION> chiefs on the grounds that they are Brazilian Indians
and cannot be tried as foreigners.
   <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>'s 220,000 Indians, including 5,500 Kayapos, are wards of
the state and do not enjoy the full rights accorded other citizens.
   Posey, however, said in a telephone interview that he wanted to
see the trial continue because ``if it's shelved, it could be
brought against others in our situation.
   ``This is a real aggression against myself, the Indians, the
scientific community in general and we want to see justice done.''
   Posey and the <LOCATION>Kayapo</LOCATION> chiefs were charged with illegal political
acitivites after they appeared at <ORGANIZATION>Florida International University</ORGANIZATION>
in <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> to speak about forest conservation.
   Later, the chiefs spoke at the <ORGANIZATION>World Bank</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION>,
where they criticized the deforestation of the <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION>, erosion,

<HEAD>Native Indians Meet to Protest Hydroelectric Dams</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER MUELLO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ALTAMIRA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In their first joint political action,
more than 500 Indians from 20 <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> rain forest tribes have
gathered in this jungle town to protest planned hydrolectric dams
that would flood their lands.
   Sporting green-and-yellow feathered headdresses and red and black
warpaint, about 100 warriors from the <LOCATION>Kayapo</LOCATION> tribe ran chanting into
a brick community center <DATE>Monday</DATE> in <ORGANIZATION>Altamira</ORGANIZATION>, which is 2,000 miles
northwest of <ORGANIZATION>Rio de Janiero</ORGANIZATION>.
   The tribe circled in a ritual dance, then sat to applaud as the
men, women and children of each subsequent tribe arrived for a week
of debates, speeches and other events.
   For the first time, <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> tribes were together to discuss common
concerns.
   The Indians are protesting the proposed Kararao and Babaquara
dams on the <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION>'s Xingu river. If built, the reservoirs would
flood about 3,000 square miles of jungle, displacing 7,000 of the
220,000 Indians who remain in <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>.
   About 5 million Indians roamed the country when the Portuguese
arrived in the <DATE>1500s</DATE> and ``settled'' what is now <LOCATION>South America</LOCATION>'s
largest nation.
   Anthropologists have expressed fears about the Indians' continued
survival, as hundreds of thousands of non-Indian homesteaders,
ranchers and prospectors stream into the <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> annually, chopping
and burning away the rain forest and ignoring demarcations of native
tribal areas.
   ``We want the government to rethink the dams,'' <PERSON>Jorge Terena</PERSON> of
the <ORGANIZATION>Terena</ORGANIZATION> tribe told a cheering crowd packed into the community
center. ``The land is sacred to us. It has the roots of our culture
and our ancestors.''
   ``We will not accept the dams,'' said <PERSON>David Yanomami</PERSON> of the
primitive <ORGANIZATION>Yanomami</ORGANIZATION> tribe. ``The river will rise. The fish will die.
The game will move away.''
   Later in the day, thousands of farmers and local shopowners
marched through <ORGANIZATION>Altamira</ORGANIZATION>, a town of 38,000, carrying placards saying
``Dams mean more jobs and more progress'' and ``Gringos leave us in
peace.''
   ``I know the Indians will have problems, but I'm in favor of the
dams,'' said <PERSON>Raimundo Castro Bastos</PERSON>, owner of an <ORGANIZATION>Altamira</ORGANIZATION> bar. ``I
believe the dams will bring development and progress for us.''
   Government and industry leaders say the energy provided by the
dams is vital for the growth of this <ORGANIZATION>Third World</ORGANIZATION> nation.
   The government representative to the meeting, <PERSON>Fernando Mesquita</PERSON>,
president of the <ORGANIZATION>Brazilian Environment Institute</ORGANIZATION>, spoke to whistles
and boos from the crowd, which included native Indian leaders from
around the world, hundreds of foreign and Brazilian
environmentalists, and droves of journalists.
   ``We recognize that great indignities were committed against the
Indian people. But now it is a question of national awareness. We
are here to listen,'' <PERSON>Mesquita</PERSON> said.
   The late <DATE>December</DATE> shooting death of internationally-known <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION>
ecologist <PERSON>Francisco Mendes</PERSON>, who fought against the destruction of
the rain forest by ranchers, increased international awareness of
the movement to preserve the jungle and protect its native peoples.
   Environmentalists are concerned that slash burning of the rain
forest is contributing to the warming of world temperatures and
destroying both a vital source of oxygen and an important habitat
for animal and plant life.
   The ecologists are trying to discourage foreign lending
institutions from putting money into Brazilian development projects
considered harmful to the enviroment and native peoples.
   Foreign governments and environmental groups have, for example,

<HEAD>Foreign Minister's Good English Seen As Bad For Portuguese Diplomacy</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The foreign minister of <LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION> has had
his knuckles rapped for what is usually considered an essential
skill in modern diplomacy _ speaking English.
   Newspapers and politicians have harshly criticized <PERSON>Joao de Deus
Pinheiro</PERSON> ever since he spoke English earlier this month at an
international conference on chemical weapons in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>.
   Critics say it breaks a pledge by the seven Portuguese-speaking
nations to promote their language _ the sixth most widely spoken in
the world _ at international events.
   More importantly, they charge <PERSON>Pinheiro</PERSON> hurt <LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION> at a time
when its influence among former colonies is increasingly being
challenged by one of them _ <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>.
   ``No speak Portuguese,'' was the motto plastered across the
T-shirt of a cartoon of <PERSON>Deus Pinheiro</PERSON> on the cover of the satirical,
right-wing weekly O Diabo.
   Another paper this week showed the stocky, bearded minister
introducing himself as ``God Pine'' _ the direct English translation
of his name.
   While <PERSON>Deus Pinheiro</PERSON> has been busy drumming up international
financial support for an economic recovery plan for the other major
Portuguese-speaking countries of <LOCATION>Angola</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> has
outflanked <LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION> on trade and relief efforts.
   Trade between <LOCATION>Angola</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> has quadrupled the last three
years to more than <MONEY>$1 billion</MONEY>.
   <LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION>'s trade with <LOCATION>Angola</LOCATION> dropped from about <MONEY>$165 million</MONEY> in
<DATE>1986</DATE> to <MONEY>$127 million</MONEY> in <DATE>1987</DATE>. For the <DATE>first eight months of 1988</DATE>,
the countries' did about <MONEY>$103 million</MONEY> in business.
   Deus <PERSON>Pinheiro</PERSON>'s recovery plan foresees <MONEY>$600 million dollars</MONEY> worth
of aid from several nations to <LOCATION>Angola</LOCATION>, but <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> has already
granted <LOCATION>Luanda</LOCATION> a <MONEY>$1.1 billion</MONEY> credit that the African nation repays
in oil it produces.
   According to one government official in <LOCATION>Brasilia</LOCATION>, next week's
planned visit by President <PERSON>Jose Sarney</PERSON> to <LOCATION>Angola</LOCATION>, the first ever by
a Brazilian head of state, should increase cooperation between the
countries.
   <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> already sells food, cars, and farm machinery to the
southern African nation and is helping to build a hydroelectric dam
there. Brazilian companies are now showing interest in helping
rebuild <LOCATION>Angola</LOCATION>'s ravaged telephone and power networks.
   ``We think <LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION> made an error (at the <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> conference),''
said <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>'s secretary of state for foreign affairs, Antonio
Materrula. ``We have to push our mutual language at an international
level.''
   Portuguese is not an official language of the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION>, but
the countries that use it _ <LOCATION>Angola</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Cape Verde</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Guinea-Bissau</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Sao Tome</LOCATION> e Principe _ count
about 180 million inhabitants.
   Only Mandarin Chinese, <ORGANIZATION>Hindi</ORGANIZATION>, English, Spanish and Russian are
spoken by more people worldwide.
   Brazilian and Mozambican delegates at the chemical weapons
conference spoke in Portuguese, further enraging <LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION>'s
politicians, scholars and journalists.
   ``It's a scandalous insult to the values and interests of our
language,'' said <PERSON>Herminio Martinho</PERSON>, leader of <LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION>'s New
Democratic Party.
   ``The importance of this language should be turned into a
diplomatic tool _and we (<LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION>) don't have many others,'' said
<PERSON>Jorge Sampaio</PERSON>, newly elected leader of <LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION>'s main opposition
<ORGANIZATION>Socialist Party</ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Brazilian Indians Demand Suspension of Amazon Dam</HEAD>
<UNK>By PETER MUELLO ^Associated Press Writer</UNK>
<DATELINE>ALTAMIRA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chiefs of Amazon Indian tribes ended a
historic meeting <DATE>Friday</DATE> with a demand to stop plans to build a
hydroelectric dam that would flood native lands.
   Hundreds of Indians, wearing colored feathers, beads and red and
black paint, stood and chanted their support as Indian leader <PERSON>Ailton
Krenac</PERSON> read an appeal to protect <LOCATION>Amazonia</LOCATION>, home to most of <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>'s
220,000 native people.
   ``We do not want the construction of dams on the <LOCATION>Xingu River</LOCATION> and
on other rivers in the <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION>, because they threaten Indian
nations,'' he said. The mostly white audience of townspeople and
representatives of environmental groups cheered and applauded.
   More than 500 Indians from about 40 native groups met for five
days in this eastern <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> city, 2,000 miles northwest of <ORGANIZATION>Rio de
Janeiro</ORGANIZATION>, to protest the proposed <ORGANIZATION>Belo Monte Dam</ORGANIZATION> on the <LOCATION>Xingu River</LOCATION>,
an <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> tributary. It was the first time Indians in <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> set
aside longstanding tribal rivalries and banded together in a
political movement.
   The reservoir of the <MONEY>$5.8 billion</MONEY> dam would flood 500 square
miles of rain forest. The dam would have a generating capacity of <MONEY>11
million kilowatts</MONEY> _ <PERCENT>40 percent</PERCENT> more than that of <LOCATION>Grand Coulee</LOCATION>, the
biggest hydroelectric dam in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>.
   ``For a long time, the white man has ignored our thinking and the
spirit of our ancestors. Now this must stop. Our territory is the
sacred site of our people, the home of our creator that cannot be
violated,'' <PERSON>Krenac</PERSON> said.
   The government contends <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> must tap the vast hydroelectric
potential of the <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> basin to progress. Federal electric power
officials at the gathering told the Indians that dams will be built.
Earlier in the week, one Indian woman thrust a machete just inches
from the face of an electricity company representative. Other tribal
people said that was merely a symbolic gesture.
   Congressman <PERSON>Tadeu Franca</PERSON>, pledged to carry on the Indians' fight
in <LOCATION>Brasilia</LOCATION>, the capital. ``Because of this meeting, it will be
Indians, working together _ not some presidential decree _ that will
build the Indians' history,'' he said.
   ``Nothing like this has ever happened before. The Indians will go
back to their villages with the sense that something really new and
important has happened,'' said <PERSON>Terry Turner</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> anthropologist
who has worked more than 20 years with the <LOCATION>Kayapo Indians</LOCATION>.
   Construction of the dam is scheduled to start in <DATE>1993</DATE>. It must
first be approved by <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>.
   <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> has shown interest in getting partial financing for the
project from the <ORGANIZATION>World Bank</ORGANIZATION>, but Indians and environmental groups
are asking the Washington-based institution not to put up any money.
   In a small victory this week, the Indians won an agreement from
the government electric power company in <LOCATION>Amazonia</LOCATION> to change the name
of the project to <ORGANIZATION>Belo Monte</ORGANIZATION> from Kararao. Kararao is a war cry of
the <LOCATION>Kayapo</LOCATION> tribe and was offensive to other tribes.

<TEXT>
   Angry Amazon Indians thrust lances and
machetes at government electric power officials <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> in a second
day of heated debate over a proposed hydroelectric dam that would
flood tribal lands.
   More than 500 Indians from 37 native groups packed the city's
community center for the historic encounter of tribes in this east
<LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> city, 2,000 miles northwest of <ORGANIZATION>Rio de Janeiro</ORGANIZATION>.
   The meeting is the first united political movement by the native
tribes, and seeks to block construction of the Kararao dam on the
<LOCATION>Xingu River</LOCATION>, an <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> tributary. <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> says the energy is vital
for development in this land of 144 million people.
   Tempers flared when <PERSON>Jose Lopes</PERSON>, engineering director for
Eletronorte, the government <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> power company, told the Indians
the dam would not raise the river beyond its present level.
   ``You're lying! Everything you say is a lie!'' shouted Tuira, a
Kayapo Indian woman as she strode through the crowd and brandished a
machete in <PERSON>Lopes</PERSON>' face.
   Her words in <LOCATION>Kayapo</LOCATION> were translated into broken Portuguese by
Chief Paulo Paiakan. He said her gesture is ``one of our traditions,
it does not mean war.''
   Kayapo warrior Uh-Te also protested angrily and repeatedly thrust
a red-feathered lance at the company offical.
   ``We don't know what energy means. I was raised on game, fish and
wild honey in the forest. Why didn't you consult us about the dam?''
said Uh-Te with Paiakan translating.
   The Indians, some wearing a green-and-yellow feathered headresses
and black warpaint on their faces and bodies, raised their war clubs
in a sign of agreement.
   <PERSON>Lopes</PERSON> said <PERSON>Eletronorte</PERSON> was preparing an environmental impact
report on the Kararao project. ``If the dam affects Indian land, it
must be approved by congress,'' he said.
   <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>'s Indian population has been decimated by development
projects such as hydroelectric dams and the Trans-Amazon highway.
There are about 220,000 Indians left in <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>, down from an
estimated 5 million when the country was discovered by Portuguese
explorers in <DATE>1500</DATE>.
   ``The dam is not a reality until construction starts,'' and that
won't happen for at least five years,'' <PERSON>Lopes</PERSON> said. He said
Eletronorte has scrapped plans for other contested <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> dams at
<LOCATION>Babaquara</LOCATION> and Iriri.
   Chief Paiakan also complained that Indians had not been consulted
about the name of the dam. Kararao is a <LOCATION>Kayapo</LOCATION> war cry, he said.
``To our youths, the government is calling us to war,'' <PERSON>Paiakan</PERSON> said.
   Lopes promised the project would be given a ``white name.''
   Earlier in <LOCATION>Brasilia</LOCATION>, Interior Minister <PERSON>Joao Alves</PERSON> said the
government would not consider stopping the Kararao project. He said
the dam was fundamental for <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>'s future and would dislocate only
about 280 Indians.
   Kararao will generate 11 million kilowatts of electricity, <PERSON>Alves</PERSON>
said _ second only to the <ORGANIZATION>Itaipu</ORGANIZATION> dam, the world's largest, located
on <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>'s southwestern border with <LOCATION>Paraguay</LOCATION>.
   Brazilian and international environmental groups attending the
five-day meeting said the Kararao project was probably unstoppable.
   ``I don't think it's likely they'll stop construction of Kararao.
But that doesn't mean the meeting is a waste,'' said <PERSON>Barbara
Bramble</PERSON>, a director of the Washington-based <ORGANIZATION>National Wildlife Fund</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``This could be a real milestone in the formation of alliances
among Amazonian peoples to work together to save the place they live
in.''
   Joining the protesters was British rock star Sting, who told the
<LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> Indian chiefs he was starting an international campaign to
raise money to create a huge <ORGANIZATION>Amazon National Park</ORGANIZATION>. He said the
campaign would begin <DATE>April 12</DATE> in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>.
   ``I'm not here on behalf of one people. If the rain forest dies
all of us are in danger,'' Sting said.
   He said he got permission for his project from President <PERSON>Jose
Sarney</PERSON>.

   A campaign to preserve the remaining half of the
world's tropical rain forests has finally taken root, but the task
is enormous and the last gasp for the ``lungs of the Earth'' could
be less than a century away.
   Environmentalists are pleased with their initial success three
years after they began challenging governments, industries and
banks. But an area the size of a soccer field is destroyed each
minute, and the young preservation movement seeks fundamental
changes in political, economic and social structures to save the
teeming jungles of <LOCATION>South America</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Southeast Asia</LOCATION>.
   An aggressive campaign of publicity, education and confrontation
began in <DATE>1985</DATE> and appeared to capture the world's attention last
year. Almost overnight, it seemed, world leaders began calling for
greater efforts to halt the chopping and burning of rain forests.
Conferences discussed such technical conservation issues as
``sustainable management.'' Rock stars Sting and The Grateful Dead
played benefit concerts for the cause. Media coverage increased.
   Some recent fruits of that effort:
   _<LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> in <DATE>October</DATE> announced suspension of tax benefits for
landowners who destroy the <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> rain forest, the largest and
fastest-disappearing on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   _<ORGANIZATION>The International Tropical Timber Organization</ORGANIZATION> approved a <MONEY>$4
million</MONEY> project in northern <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> that calls for loggers to consult
with environmental groups, government agencies, native Indians and
local workers to plan long-term forest development and preservation.
   _Some 500 Brazilian Indians from 20 tribes gathered last month to
oppose planned hydroelectric dams in the <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> that could flood
rain forest areas, including their homes. The meeting was the first
by the tribes, which traditionally have battled over territory and
remained isolated.
   _<LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION> imposed a nationwide logging ban after
environmentalists blamed uncontrolled timber harvesting for floods
that killed more than 350 people in <DATE>November</DATE>. Last <DATE>April</DATE>, officials
suspended plans for a hydroelectric dam that environmentalists said
would have ruined <LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION>'s last virgin rain forest.
   _<LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION> earmarked about <MONEY>$80 million</MONEY> for saving tropical
forests.
   ``Without a coherent strategy for protecting the tropical forests
in which everyone concerned participates, we cannot master the vast
problems threatening the future of all mankind,'' said West German
Chancellor <PERSON>Helmut Kohl</PERSON>.
   ``We have to be ambitious. We're in trouble,'' said <PERSON>Randall
Hayes</PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION>U.S.-based Rainforest Action Network</ORGANIZATION>. ``If we
don't get the changes we need in the next five years, then we've
lost the rain forests.''
   The results could be catastrophic.
   Rain forests cover some 2.4 billion acres of the planet, about
half the original amount, ecologists say.
   Sometimes called the ``lungs of the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>,'' they act as a
pollution filter, absorbing carbon dioxide and producing oxygen. If
carbon dioxide isn't removed from the atmosphere, it can trap heat,
which some scientists say causes a global warming trend called the
greenhouse effect. Burning the rain forests, a common way to create
arable land, also adds carbon to the atmosphere.
   Rain forests are storehouses of plant, insect and animal species,
some of which could prove useful for drugs and other scientific
endeavors. Scientists say only a small percentage of the 5 million
species in the forests, many of them unique to the tropical
environment, have been studied.
   In addition, 200 million people live in and around rain forests,
including indigenous tribes who depend on them for sustenance and
shelter.
   Nonetheless, preservation presents complexities that cut across
social and political boundaries. Many rain forests are in developing
countries that need to capitalize on their natural resources and
must borrow money for costly modernization projects, such as
highways and power plants.
   <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>, for example, has the developing world's largest foreign
debt at <MONEY>$115 billion</MONEY>. Two of its limited number of export products
are beef and timber _industries that cause major forest destruction.
Cattle ranchers burn forests to create grazing land; loggers clear
jungle in search of exotic hardwoods.
   Meanwhile, poor farmers burn small tracts to grow crops. The
soil, so fertile under the rain forest canopy, is then leached of
nutrients in seasonal heavy rains, forcing farmers to move on and
burn another patch every few years.
   Last fall, Brazilian President <PERSON>Jose Sarney</PERSON> suspended tax benefits
for land developers and banned exports of unprocessed tropical
timber. ``We must create nationwide consciousness that we are all
passengers in the adventure of man on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. The era of unlimited
natural resources is over,'' he said.
   But environmentalists contend the harmful practices continue.
Now, <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> is balking at proposals to swap some of its foreign debt
for saving parcels of rain forest. Such plans would entail creation
of an international commission to watch over the preserved jungle.
   ``We can't turn the <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> into a sort of national park for
humanity,'' <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>'s foreign minister, <PERSON>Roberto de Abreu Sodre</PERSON>, said.
``Our priority is economic development. We're open to international
suggestions, but not those that interfere in Brazilian sovereignty.''
   Industrial giants such as the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and European
countries, which have little or no rain forest, have been the most
vocal about the developing nations' efforts to halt the destruction.
That causes particular resentment.
   A conference of eight nations in the <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> region, including
<LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>, earlier this month issued a declaration rejecting foreign
interference while saying development must preserve the environment
and wild resources.
   ``Part of the problem is that it's coming down to the developed
countries versus the developing countries,'' said a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> activist
who monitors the <ORGANIZATION>World Bank</ORGANIZATION>, the largest source of aid to developing
nations.
   ``They (developing countries) say, `You raped your countries to
get developed, and now you're stopping us from doing it,''' said the
activist, who spoke on condition his name not be used.
   But <PERSON>N.F. Potter</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>'s executive director at the <ORGANIZATION>151-nation
World Bank</ORGANIZATION>, said: ``There are ways of doing things without making
the same mistakes.''
   The <ORGANIZATION>World Bank</ORGANIZATION> has been criticized by environmentalists, who say
it ignores ecological issues when funding projects. At issue are
billions of dollars; in the <DATE>fiscal year ending June 30</DATE>, the bank
expects to loan a record <MONEY>$21 billion</MONEY>.
   ``These bankers are unbelievably ignorant. They are absolutely
reckless,'' said <PERSON>Brent Blackwelder</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>U.S.-based Environmental
Policy Institute</ORGANIZATION>.
   Under increasing pressure from member nations and environmental
groups not to fund ecologically harmful projects, the bank set up a
department in <DATE>1987</DATE> to assess the potential damage of development
projects.
   ``You can see a lot more environmental consciousness than there
was two years ago,'' said an official with a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> agency that
monitors aid. ``There has been movement. I'm not saying there has
been all the movement necessary.''

<FÊP=106> [Report by Arlete Milhomen] </F>
  [Text] The Portuguese-speaking countries community probably 
will be created before <DATE>July</DATE>. The foreign ministers of the seven 
Portuguese-speaking countries -- <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Angola</LOCATION>, 
<ORGANIZATION>Guinea Bissau</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Sao Tome</LOCATION> and Principe, and <LOCATION>Cape Verde</LOCATION> 
-- today signed a joint communique as the basis for the 
establishment of the community of Portuguese-speaking countries. 
The document has 13 points that are fundamental for the group's 
implementation. The main items are: social, cultural, and 
economic cooperation among the countries' inhabitants; the 
implementation in the short term of the <ORGANIZATION>Portuguese Language 
International Institute</ORGANIZATION>; and support for an immediate cease-fire 
in <LOCATION>Angola</LOCATION>, where a civil war is under way. 
  Brazilian Foreign Minister <PERSON>Celso Amorim</PERSON> said the community 
will be a great opportunity to intensify relations among the 
member countries. He added that it will not prevent them from 
participating in other groups: 
  [Begin recording] <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>, for example, which is currently a 
<ORGANIZATION>UN Security Council</ORGANIZATION> member, has been acting in coordination with 
other countries. It is necessary, however, to make this 
coordination and common agreement more permanent then it is in 
other forums. In <LOCATION>Latin America</LOCATION>, for example, we participate in 
the <ORGANIZATION>Rio Group</ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION> is a <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> member. The African 
Portuguese-speaking countries are <ORGANIZATION>OAU</ORGANIZATION> members. Therefore, this 
association will allow us to make better use of our common 
efforts. [end recording] 
  The community of Portuguese-speaking countries will be 
comprised of more than 200 million people spread over three 
continents. In addition to the language, these peoples share 
historic and ethnic traits. The community will become official 
during a meeting of the member countries' chiefs of state, which 
probably will be held in <LOCATION>Lisbon</LOCATION> before <DATE>July</DATE>.

will visit <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> in early <DATE>February</DATE> to try to prevent the 
<LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> from retaliating against <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>, which will 
probably not be able to meet the 28 <DATE>February</DATE> deadline to approve 
a bill on industrial property rights (trademarks and patents). 
  The fatal deadline imposed by the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> is already 
the extension of an investigation into Brazilian industrial 
property law. Last <DATE>November</DATE> the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Government</ORGANIZATION> decided to 
bring forward by three months its decision on whether to adopt 
restrictive measures on Brazilian exports. 
  This subject was discussed yesterday by Foreign Minister 
<PERSON>Celso Amorim</PERSON> and 20 businessmen from the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Chamber of 
Commerce</ORGANIZATION>. The minister does not think there will be 
difficulties in the talks with the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, because the 
Brazilian draft bill being discussed in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> "will be very 
similar to the intellectual property agreement" of the <ORGANIZATION>Uruguay 
Round of GATT</ORGANIZATION> talks which concluded last 15 <DATE>December</DATE>. 
  "An action that does not take into consideration what was 
attained bilaterally and multilaterally would be technically 
precipitate and politically inopportune. If <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> had wanted 
to, it would have hindered the <ORGANIZATION>GATT</ORGANIZATION> intellectual property 
agreement," <PERSON>Amorim</PERSON> said. 
  The main point of controversy in the Brazilian draft bill is 
the requirement that pharmaceutical products must be 
manufactured in <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> in order to obtain a license. The text 
of the <ORGANIZATION>GATT</ORGANIZATION> agreement on the subject is ambiguous, and has not 
yet been clarified within the <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> Convention which deals with 
intellectual property rights. "The text of the agreement deals 
with the subject indirectly. Political vision is necessary to 
deal with this ambiguity, which will in time be resolved," <PERSON>Celso 
Amorim</PERSON> said. 
  The foreign minister also spoke with the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Chamber of 
Commerce</ORGANIZATION> businessmen about the Common Market of the South, the 
<LOCATION>Uruguay</LOCATION> Round of the <ORGANIZATION>GATT</ORGANIZATION> talks, and trade problems between 
<LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, such as problems in the iron and 
steel industry and in the shoe and tobacco sectors.

<HEAD>Panel: Gold Mining, Settlements Killing Indians and Rain Forest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JORGE MEDEROS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of gold prospectors in the
<LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> are devastating rain forests and killing off the world's
largest primitive Indian tribe, a panel of officials, scientists and
clerics said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
   Indian reservations are being ``physically, morally and
culturally destroyed'' by uncontrolled gold mining and settlement in
the region, said ``Action for the Citizens.''
   It is the first time government officials have spoken against
destruction of the Yanomami Indian tribe and the rain forest by gold
miners. In this nation where the frontier spirit is strong and
rugged prospectors are widely seen as folk heroes, the government
has rarely intervened.
   The commission of <ORGANIZATION>Justice Ministry</ORGANIZATION> officials, lawmakers, lawyers,
scientists, <ORGANIZATION>Roman Catholic Church</ORGANIZATION> members and missionaries said
whites disrupted Indian hunting, contaminated rivers with mercury
used to join gold dust particles and spread fatal diseases among the
Indian population.
   The Yanomamis are a tribe of about 9,000 in the far northern
states of Amazonas and <LOCATION>Roraima</LOCATION>, near the Venezuelan border. The area
is rich in timber, gold, diamonds and other minerals and has been
invaded by an estimated 100,000 prospectors, despite a government
ban prohibiting whites from entering Indian reservations.
   ``Owing to the tolerance of the authorities before an invasion of
thousands of gold miners into the reserves, we are seeing the
genocide of the Yanomani Indians, devastation of nature,
contamination of rivers and a gigantic ecological disaster,'' <PERSON>Sen.
Severo Gomes</PERSON> of the centrist <ORGANIZATION>Brazilian Democratic Movement Party</ORGANIZATION>
said in an interview.
   Gomes had joined <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> member <PERSON>Plinio Arruda Sampaio</PERSON> of the
leftist Workers' Party, Archbishop <PERSON>Aldo Mongiano</PERSON> and 15 other
members in a recent three-day trip to several <ORGANIZATION>Yanomami</ORGANIZATION> reservations
in the far-off jungle state of <LOCATION>Roraima</LOCATION>, some 3,720 miles northwest
of <ORGANIZATION>Rio de Janeiro</ORGANIZATION>.
   The delegation also visited territories of the <ORGANIZATION>Macuxi</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Wapixana</LOCATION>,
Ingarico, and Taurepang tribes, which have been invaded by ranchers
that burned off and cleared indigenous farmland.
   The 26-page report denounced a ``complete disregard for the law''
by the miners and the lack of government enforcement in the region,
which it said even led to contrabanding of gold.
   All gold is required by law to be sold to the government.
   ``The miners themselves, with their guns, resolve all legal
problems,'' said <PERSON>Senator Gomes</PERSON>.
   Prospectors illegally used jungle airstrips cut by the <ORGANIZATION>Brazilian
Air Force</ORGANIZATION> ``every five minutes'' to transport cargo and manpower by
helicopter and planes, said <PERSON>Sampaio</PERSON>.
   ``The whole thing looks like <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> during the war,'' he said.
``The hellish noise of planes and helicopters sends the Indians
scattering.''
   Last year, the powerful <ORGANIZATION>Bishops Council</ORGANIZATION> of the <ORGANIZATION>Roman Catholic
Church</ORGANIZATION> warned that the Yanomamis faced extinction if their lands
were taken away. The council said the government reduced by <PERCENT>70
percent</PERCENT> the tribe's 17.3 million acres of land, divided into 19
separate tracts.
   About 220,000 Indians are left in <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>, down from an estimated
5 million when the country was discovered by the Portuguese in <DATE>1500</DATE>.

<HEAD>Amazon Indians March on Presidential Palace to Protest Invasion of
Lands</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scores of <ORGANIZATION>Amazon Indians</ORGANIZATION> in war paint
marched on the presidential palace <DATE>Thursday</DATE> to demand the removal of
tens of thousands of gold miners who invaded tribal lands.
   Shouting ``Give back the stolen land!'' and ``We want peace, not
war!'' about 100 Indians of the <ORGANIZATION>Yanomami</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Kayapo</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Guarani</ORGANIZATION> and
Kaingang tribes advanced to the marble-and-glass palace.
   The protesters, wearing green parrot-feather headresses and
red-and-black war paint and carrying wooden clubs, sang tribal
chants and demanded to see President <PERSON>Jose Sarney</PERSON>.
   Sarney refused to receive the group, and an aide said the Indians
should lodge their complaints with the <ORGANIZATION>Interior Ministry</ORGANIZATION>.
   The protest was led by Chief <PERSON>Davi Kopenawa</PERSON> of the 9,000-member
Yanomami tribe. The Yanomamis live in the remote northern <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> on
<LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>'s border with <LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION>, a region rich in timber, gold and
diamonds.
   Kopenawa said the Indians wanted to deliver a petition to <PERSON>Sarney</PERSON>
demanding the immediate removal of an estimated 40,000 gold
prospectors from the <LOCATION>Yanomami</LOCATION> reservation. The government said it
began removing prospectors from the region <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   ``Sarney should obey the constitution,'' said <PERSON>Kopenawa</PERSON>, who last
year won a <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> award for his defense of the environment.
   He said <PERCENT>70 percent</PERCENT> of the Yanomamis' land _ originally covering
22 million acres _ have been converted into national parks and
forests. But the government has been unable or unwilling to keep
prospectors out of the mineral-rich area.
   Environmental and Indian protection groups claim the invasion of
gold miners has spread disease, made game scarce and contaminated
rivers.
   ``We don't want our families to go on dying,'' said <PERSON>Kopenawa</PERSON>,
adding that the Yanomamis wanted an emergency health plan.
   The chief threatened to return the <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> award if the government
didn't take action against the prospectors.
   ``This medal, which I didn't ask for ... is not resolving
anything,'' he said.
   The Indians arrived in <LOCATION>Brasilia</LOCATION> earlier this week and tried to
meet with presidential candidates. None of the leading candidates
would meet with them.
   Brazilians are to vote <DATE>Nov. 15</DATE> in the first free election for
president since <DATE>1960</DATE>.
   <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> has about 220,000 native Indians, down from an estimated 5
million when the nation was discovered by Portuguese explorers in
<DATE>1500</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Fernando Gabeira</PERSON>, the presidential candidate of the small <ORGANIZATION>Green
Party</ORGANIZATION> and a supporter of the Indians' cause, said ``there is no
consciousness in <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> of the importance of Indian culture.''
   <PERSON>Ricardo Pedreira</PERSON>, the presidential press secretary, said the
government and federal police began <DATE>Thursday</DATE> to remove the first
group of 90 miners from <LOCATION>Yanomami</LOCATION> land.
   He said officials also would try to close an estimated 70
clandestine air strips on the reservation. Small planes ferry some
miners to the region.

  [Text] <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION> will probably be the fifth country to join the 
Common Market of the South, <ORGANIZATION>Mercosur</ORGANIZATION>. Chilean Foreign Minister 
<PERSON>Carlos Figueroa</PERSON> and Brazilian counterpart <PERSON>Celso Amorim</PERSON> reported 
this news in <LOCATION>Belem</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Para State</ORGANIZATION> on the night of 5 <DATE>June</DATE>. Here is 
<PERSON>Antonia Marcia Vale</PERSON>'s report: 
  [Begin recording] [Vale] Since the beginning of the <ORGANIZATION>Mercosur</ORGANIZATION> 
negotiations, <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION> has refused to participate. The Chilean 
foreign minister now states that his country's interest in 
joining <ORGANIZATION>Mercosur</ORGANIZATION> follows President <PERSON>Itamar Franco</PERSON>'s proposal, in 
<LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION> in <DATE>December 1993</DATE>, to establish a free-trade zone in <LOCATION>Latin 
America</LOCATION>. 
  Brazilian Foreign Minister <PERSON>Celso Amorim</PERSON> asserted that if 
<LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION> joins Mercosur it will be advantageous and represent a 
door for Brazilian exports to the <LOCATION>Pacific Region</LOCATION> market. 
  [Amorim] This possibility is important for us, not just 
because <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION> has commercial and political importance or because 
of old ties that bind our two countries. Mercosur member 
countries have always considered the possibility of <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION> 
becoming a member. As the Chilean foreign minister said, this 
initiative is a result of the current <ORGANIZATION>Brazilian Government</ORGANIZATION>, of 
President <PERSON>Itamar Franco</PERSON>'s proposal to establish a South American 
free-trade area. This shows we have indeed been working in the 
right direction. This possibility gives us enormous 
satisfaction. 
  [Vale] The foreign minister reported that <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>'s main 
concern about entering <ORGANIZATION>Mercosur</ORGANIZATION> had been the high taxes charged 
by <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> on imported items. Minister Amorim added that this 
difficulty has practically ceased because currently our custom 
fees average just <PERCENT>14 percent</PERCENT>. [end recording]

<FÊP=106> [Article by Reali Junior] </F>
  [Text] <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> is giving up the passive diplomacy that has 
prevailed during the past few years in its relations with 
<LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>. During his visit to <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>, Foreign Minister <PERSON>Celso 
Amorim</PERSON> has been trying to design a more dynamic position for 
Brazilian diplomacy and counter the self-restraint our country 
has been imposing on its foreign presence. High-level meetings 
have been scheduled for <DATE>April</DATE> when British Foreign Minister 
<PERSON>Douglas Hurd</PERSON> visits <LOCATION>Brasilia</LOCATION>, and the Brazilian foreign minister 
will visit <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> at the invitation of his counterpart, <PERSON>Alain 
Juppe</PERSON>. Amorim will address the <ORGANIZATION>Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee</ORGANIZATION> then. 
  These bilateral meetings have not been held for some years. 
As just an example of the poor period being experienced by 
Brazilian diplomacy, the French foreign minister's visit to 
<LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> has been postponed four consecutive times during the past 
few years. 
  The positive results of the foreign minister's visit to 
<LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> foreshadow a new period. In <LOCATION>Bonn</LOCATION> on 25 <DATE>February</DATE>, the 
Brazilian foreign minister himself announced these two important 
meetings with the British and French foreign ministers to O 
ESTADO DO SAO PAULO. Amorim said: "If <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> hopes to play a 
leading role in the international arena, it cannot give up these 
talks." The Brazilian foreign minister accused former President 
<PERSON>Fernando Collor</PERSON> of destroying our country's foreign policy and 
not replacing it. 
  The Brazilian foreign minister admitted that recently our 
country has been placing less emphasis than it should on its 
bilateral relations. This explains the new effort toward 
<LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>United Kingdom</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>'s three 
principal European partners, which represents a priority in 
<ORGANIZATION>Itamaraty</ORGANIZATION>'s strategy. The effort to further approach these <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> 
countries is obviously aimed at attracting technology and 
investments. Amorim emphasized: "To this end, however, it is 
necessary to hold political talks." 
  In the case of <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>, the Brazilian foreign minister 
explained: "The tripartite agreement's ratification was 
essential because diplomacy and development must work together." 
  Concerning specific projects, the minister confirmed the 
German interest in <ORGANIZATION>Sivam</ORGANIZATION> [<ORGANIZATION>Amazon Region Surveillance System</ORGANIZATION>]. 
The Germans are interested in installing the air traffic 
control system in the <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> region. The French and Americans 
also have expressed interest in this project. The <ORGANIZATION>Brazilian 
Government</ORGANIZATION>'s decision on the submitted proposals must be made by 
late <DATE>April</DATE>.

<HEAD>Ecologists Applaud Choice for New Environment Minister</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER MUELLO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defenders of nature say the
appointment of <PERSON>Jose Lutzenberger</PERSON>, a noted ecologist, as <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>'s
environment minister could signal an end to wanton destruction of
the <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> rain forest.
   The choice of <PERSON>Lutzenberger</PERSON>, 63, was seen as a victory for
conservationists, who claim the government has done little to stop
slash-and-burn devastation of the <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION>. He was named by President
<PERSON>Fernando Collor de Mello</PERSON>, who took office <DATE>March 15</DATE>.
   By <DATE>1988</DATE>, ranchers and farmers had destroyed about <PERCENT>8 percent</PERCENT> of
the rain forest in the 2 million square miles of <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> wilderness,
said <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> researcher <PERSON>Philip Fearnside</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>National Institute of
Research</ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION>.
   Carbon dioxide produced by the burning is believed to add to the
``greenhouse effect'' warming the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s surface.
   ``<PERSON>Lutzenberger</PERSON> is the right man in the right place; nobody else
has his credibility,'' <PERSON>Johan Dalgas Frisch</PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION>Wildlife
Preservation Association</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Sao Paulo</LOCATION>, said in an interview.
   Antonio <PERSON>Carlos de Oliveira</PERSON> of the ecology group <PERSON>Oikos</PERSON> said: ``He
is superimportant, a legend. We all have the greatest respect and
admiration for him.''
   Lutzenberger seeks radical changes in <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>'s environmental
policy. He favors solar, wind and other natural forms of energy
over the huge hydroelectric complexes of recent decades.
   A Rio newspaper made the wry comment that <PERSON>Lutzenberger</PERSON> was so
radical about protecting nature that he even opposed lawn mowers.
   The new environment minister told <ORGANIZATION>The Associated Press</ORGANIZATION>: ``We
have to question the fundamental doctrines of modern industrial
society, which is geared to the needs of the powerful. We're not
saying give up technology, but go a different way.''
   In his first week on the job, <PERSON>Lutzenberger</PERSON> spoke out against the
controversial Northern Rim project, which would create army posts
to guard <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>'s vast jungle border.
   He also promised to review a decision that allowed gold miners
to settle on land claimed by the primitive <ORGANIZATION>Yanomami Indians</ORGANIZATION>.
   Prospectors have invaded <ORGANIZATION>Yanomami</ORGANIZATION> land in the remote western
<LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> state of <LOCATION>Roraima</LOCATION>, devastating the forest and bringing
disease and death to the Indians.
   After consulting with <PERSON>Lutzenberger</PERSON> and visiting the area, <PERSON>Collor</PERSON>
ordered the dynamiting of clandestine air strips on tribal land and
said the Northern Rim project would be redirected toward protecting
the environment.
   ``We must remove the prospectors, but we also must give them
decent living conditions,'' <PERSON>Lutzenberger</PERSON> said. ``They are not there
because they're bad or want to destroy.''
   Lutzenberger, a descendant of German immigrants, is an
agronomist with a degree from the <ORGANIZATION>University of Louisiana</ORGANIZATION>. In the
<DATE>1970s</DATE>, he resigned as a chemical company executive to join the
ecology movement and helped found <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>'s first environmental
protection group.
   Later, <PERSON>Lutzenberger</PERSON> established an environmental consulting firm.
   He pushed for tougher laws on pesticide control and for
installation of anti-pollution filters at a cellulose plant in his
native <LOCATION>Rio Grande</LOCATION> do Sul state, in southern <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Lutzenberger</PERSON> was among the first to sound the alarm about the
<LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION>.
   ``This problem concerns all of humanity,'' he told reporters
shortly after becoming environment secretary.
   ``It concerns the continuation of life on this planet. This
requires not just plans for preservation, protection or parks. It
requires fundamentally rethinking our economic programs.''
   He appealed for help from industrialized countries.
   ``We must establish now an intensive and continuing dialogue
between the governments of the <ORGANIZATION>First World</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Third World</ORGANIZATION> on
how we can collaborate to save the last jungles,'' <PERSON>Lutzenberger</PERSON>
told the journalists.
   One way, he said, is to write off part of <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>'s <MONEY>$114 billion</MONEY>
foreign debt against programs to preserve the <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION>.
   <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> has rejected such ``debt for nature'' swaps on grounds
they violate national sovereignty. Of that, <PERSON>Lutzenberger</PERSON> said:
   ``The idea is to find ways to reduce the debt in exchange for
the preservation of <LOCATION>Amazonia</LOCATION> by our government. There is not the
slightest intention to `internationalize' the <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION>.''
   A key test of his strength is likely to be a proposed highway
from the western <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> through <LOCATION>Peru</LOCATION> to the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION>.
   Lutzenberger opposes the highway, but <LOCATION>Peru</LOCATION> and governors of
<LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>'s Amazonian states say it is vital to economic development
in the region. Most of the governors supported <PERSON>Collor</PERSON> for president.
   ``The important thing to watch is how much power he has. Let's
see what happens when he conflicts with the highway lobby,''
<PERSON>Fearnside</PERSON>, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> researcher, said in a telephone interview from
<LOCATION>Manaus</LOCATION>, in the <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> jungle 3,000 miles northwest of Rio.
   Some fear <PERSON>Lutzenberger</PERSON>'s well-known temper and firm convictions
could work against him.
   ``If he's very radical, <PERSON>Collor</PERSON> will be pressured to get rid of
him,'' <PERSON>Frisch</PERSON> said.

  Amorim refuted criticism that the implementation of <ORGANIZATION>Mercosur</ORGANIZATION> 
was being delayed. He added that the member countries are 
merely negotiating schedules with longer adjustment terms for 
the implementation of the common custom fee. 
  The minister told the congressmen that trade among the

  [Text] AGENCIA BRASIL reported that Foreign Minister <PERSON>Celso 
Amorim</PERSON>, indirectly referring to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, yesterday 
criticized the adoption of unilateral measures by some countries 
"without respect for international law and to the detriment of 
the development of countries such as <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION> [no closing 
quotation mark as published]. The foreign minister said <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> 
refuses "to admit the imposition of other countries' laws" 
within its territory, alluding to the Torricelli Law which 
punishes <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> companies that do business with <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION>, even though 
they are subsidiaries installed in other countries. 
  Amorim's observations came during a speech at a lunch 
offered 
in honor of <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION>'s Vice President <PERSON>Carlos Lage</PERSON> who began a 
two-day visit to <LOCATION>Brasilia</LOCATION> today. Amorim expressed hope that the 
political changes being implemented in <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION> today will "help to 
facilitate, as we all wish, <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION>'s full reinsertion in the 
hemisphere's coexistence." 
  The Brazilian foreign minister said <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION> can join 
forces "to overcome our weaknesses," citing as examples the 
benefits that might be derived from the recent bilateral 
agreement for the purchase of medicines in <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION>; exchanges in 
the agroindustrial field, particularly on sugar and alcohol; and 
bilateral scientific and technical cooperation. 
  The Cuban vice president said that during his conversation 
with Amorim the Brazilian foreign minister reiterated <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>'s 
position against the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> embargo on <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION>. "The embargo has 
caused our country many difficulties and it is important that it 
is rejected by all Latin American countries," <PERSON>Carlos Lage</PERSON> said.

<FÊP=106> [Article by <PERSON>Luiz Orlando Carneiro</PERSON> from <LOCATION>Brasilia</LOCATION>] </F>
  [Text] Cuban President <PERSON>Fidel Castro</PERSON>'s invitation to former 
Brazilian President <PERSON>Fernando Collor</PERSON> to spend a few days in 
<LOCATION>Varadero</LOCATION>, a Cuban sea resort, has displeased Brazilian President 
<PERSON>Itamar Franco</PERSON> and has taken Itamaraty [<ORGANIZATION>Brazilian Foreign 
Ministry</ORGANIZATION>] by surprise. It is possible that <PERSON>Franco</PERSON> will eliminate 
from his agenda a meeting with Cuban Vice President [title as 
published] <PERSON>Carlos Lage Davila</PERSON>, who will be officially visiting 
<LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> 2-7 <DATE>February</DATE>. 
  Cuban Ambassador to <PERSON>Brazil Jorge Bolanos</PERSON> went to Itamaraty 
on 
21 <DATE>January</DATE> and told Brazilian Foreign Minister <PERSON>Celso Amorim</PERSON> that 
<PERSON>Castro</PERSON>'s invitation to <PERSON>Fernando Collor</PERSON> was strictly personal. 
According to <ORGANIZATION>Itamaraty</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>Luiz Fernando Benedini</PERSON>, the 
meeting between Minister Amorim and the Cuban ambassador had 
been scheduled in advance. Benedini denied that the ambassador 
had been summoned for an explanation. The spokesman refused to 
comment on behalf of the minister on the possible displeasure 
that <PERSON>Castro</PERSON>'s invitation to <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>'s former president, found 
guilty of malfeasance in office, may have caused. 
  According to information on hand, the former president was 
supposed to go to <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION> as part of a business delegation together 
with his old friend, businessman <PERSON>Luiz Estevao</PERSON>. Collor was 
reportedly invited to stay at the official guest house in 
<LOCATION>Varadero</LOCATION> where his former wife <PERSON>Lilibeth Monteiro de Carvalho</PERSON> and 
his children <PERSON>Arnon Affonso</PERSON> and <PERSON>Joaquim Pedro</PERSON> have stayed in the 
past. The trip of the business delegation was postponed because 
the health of <PERSON>Luiz Estevao</PERSON>'s father took a turn for the worse, 
but <PERSON>Collor</PERSON> confirmed that he plans to spend a few days in <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION>. 
<PERSON>Fidel Castro</PERSON> -- who still maintains a personal relationship 
with the former Brazilian president -- was unable to withdraw 
his earlier invitation. 
  Vice President <PERSON>Carlos Lage</PERSON>'s official visit to <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> had 
been arranged some time ago. Lage's agenda includes meetings 
with President <PERSON>Franco</PERSON>, Foreign Minister <PERSON>Celso Amorim</PERSON>, Finance 
Minister <PERSON>Fernando Henrique Cardoso</PERSON>, and Health Minister <PERSON>Henrique 
Santillo</PERSON>. 
  [<LOCATION>Sao Paulo</LOCATION> FOLHA DE SAO PAULO in Portuguese on 21 <DATE>January</DATE> on 
page A6 carries a 200-word report noting that "on 22 <DATE>January</DATE> 
Collor will be boarding a plane for <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION>, the first leg of a 
30-day vacation. Collor, who is traveling with his wife <PERSON>Rosane</PERSON>, 
will visit <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION>, then go to <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> and end up in the Cap Ferrat 
resort in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>."]

<HEAD>Church Group Denounces Violence Against Native Indians</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A church group on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> denounced the
slaying of 36 Indians during <DATE>1988</DATE> and blamed the government of
President <PERSON>Jose Sarney</PERSON> for ``increasing violence against native
populations'' in <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>.
   At least 28 of the deaths were linked to battles over land, and
in the majority of cases ``authorities took no measures to find or
punish the guilty parties,'' <ORGANIZATION>Antonio Brand</ORGANIZATION>, executive secretary of
the <ORGANIZATION>Indian Missionary Council</ORGANIZATION>, said in a press conference.
   Brand said the worst Indian massacre last year was the <DATE>March 28</DATE>
slaying of 14 <ORGANIZATION>Tikuna Indians</ORGANIZATION> in the far northern state of Amazonas
after a dispute over land with a wealthy wood dealer.
   In a press release, the council also mentioned the death of 25
Yanomami Indians through diseases transmitted by white men such as
malaria or poisoning by mercury, which is used by gold prospectors
to refine the precious metal.
   Brand said the government's refusal to remove the thousands of
gold prospectors from <LOCATION>Yanomami</LOCATION> territory in the <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> jungle region
``will allow the continued massacre of this people.''
   The Yanomami Indians are <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>'s most primitive tribe and live
almost without contact with the modern world close to <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>'s
northern border with <LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION>.
   Brand said the government was ``responsible for the state of
chronic violence'' that exists in the rain forest, which is rich in
gold, diamonds, iron ore and uranium.
   Currently about 220,000 native Indians and 430 tribes remain out
of a population estimated at 5 million when <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> was discovered by
the Portuguese.
   About <PERCENT>15 percent</PERCENT> of the <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> has been destroyed by farming,
gold prospecting and mining, according to the <ORGANIZATION>U.S.-based Institute
for Policy Studies</ORGANIZATION>. An estimated 400,000 gold prospectors are
located throughout the <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> and, along with farmers and
wood-cutters, often involve themselves in territory disputes with
Indians.

  [Excerpts] President <PERSON>Soares</PERSON> is in <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>. He does not tire 
of advocating a good relationship between all peoples of the 
Lusophone countries, and he backs the community being prepared. 
Among other advantages, it will carry a significant weight at 
the <ORGANIZATION>UN</ORGANIZATION>, which could help many people in the future. These were 
<PERSON>Soares</PERSON>' words in an exclusive interview with Renascenca. Ines 
Saldanha also spoke to President <PERSON>Soares</PERSON> about the political 
contacts he has been having and of <PERSON>Itamar Franco</PERSON>'s visit to 
<LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION>. 
  [Begin recording] [Soares] First of all, at the invitation 
of 
Vice President <PERSON>Itamar Franco</PERSON>, we are preparing a major meeting 
to be held in <LOCATION>Lisbon</LOCATION> and a major meeting of Lusophone countries 
at a head-of-state level. [passage omitted] 
  [<LOCATION>Saldanha</LOCATION>] You place great importance on the <DATE>July</DATE> meeting of 
Lusophone countries, and I know that that is related to the 
importance you give to a greater weight of those countries in 
the <ORGANIZATION>UN</ORGANIZATION>. Do you think that could help <LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION> in matters such 
as <LOCATION>Indonesia</LOCATION>? 
  [Soares] Of course. They all have come out, and even <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> 
recently came out very clearly in favor of <LOCATION>East Timor</LOCATION> and in 
favor of its self-determination. This carries some weight. But 
I am thinking beyond the present. I am thinking of the future. 
  [<LOCATION>Saldanha</LOCATION>] Are you thinking of the community of Lusophone 
countries the Brazilian ambassador talks of? 
  [Soares] Exactly. I am thinking of a community, a 
Luso-Afro-Brazilian community that could have an important 
specific weight in the <DATE>21st century</DATE>. 
  [<ORGANIZATION>Saldanha</ORGANIZATION>] And do you think that is viable considering the 
conditions in <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Angola</LOCATION>? 
  [Soares] Precisely, what I want is a joint plan by <LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION> 
and <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> to help our African brothers, who are in a bad 
situation but will be great nations in the future. 
  [<ORGANIZATION>Saldanha</ORGANIZATION>] Have you invited President Itamar to visit 
<LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION> before the end of your mandate? 
  [<ORGANIZATION>Soares] Naturally</ORGANIZATION>, it has been confirmed that he will visit 
in <DATE>June</DATE>. Before the summit of heads of state, he will come on a 
bilateral state visit to <LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION>, and I will have the honor of 
receiving him in <LOCATION>Lisbon</LOCATION>. [end recording]

<HEAD>Brazil's Environment Chief Vows to Develop the Amazon `Humanely'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JORGE MEDEROS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>'s environment czar vowed <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>
to curb the destruction of the <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> rain forest and to develop
the biologically sensitive area in a ``rational, humane and
ecological'' manner.
   ``We can't stop development and growth, but yes, we can make
human occupation compatible with the survival of the planet,'' said
<ORGANIZATION>National Environment</ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON>Jose Lutzenberger</PERSON>.
   <PERSON>Lutzenberger</PERSON>, 64, outlined a plan for encouraging development
and farming while preserving the unique ecological balance of the
2-million square mile rain forest.
   A world-renown ecologist, he said the government will introduce
a program to revitalize the forest's soil through organic
agricultural methods and to reduce the traditional style of
slash-and-burn farming that has destroyed 200,000 square miles of
the region.
   He said the <ORGANIZATION>Collor de Mello</ORGANIZATION> administration, which first took
office in <DATE>March</DATE>, will also quadruple its fire-fighting efforts.
   ``In this way we will stop small farmers, impoverished by soil
that only gives two or three harvests, from burning other tracts of
the jungle,'' said <PERSON>Lutzenberger</PERSON>. He said the <ORGANIZATION>World Bank</ORGANIZATION> and the
<ORGANIZATION>Inter-American Development Bank</ORGANIZATION> had expressed interest in financing
the program but gave no details.
   Slash-and-burn farmers clear large tracts of unused land by
setting fires and then plant crops until the soil is exhausted.
They then move on to fresh land.
   <PERSON>Lutzenberger</PERSON> said the burnings are now monitored by satellites
that can detect even small brush fires. He said forest rangers in
helicopters are used to catch and fine violators.
   He said <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> will also explore alternative energy sources such
as solar, wind and biomass energy instead of building the huge
hydroelectric dams that were popular in recent decades.
   Environmentalists have opposed the dams saying they flood huge
tracts of <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> land, killing trees and animals while providing
few benefits for the thousands of Indians and Brazilian farmers
living in the area.
   He specifically singled out the <ORGANIZATION>Itaipu</ORGANIZATION> dam, built by <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Paraguay</LOCATION> on the <LOCATION>Parana River</LOCATION> dividing the countries and the <LOCATION>Tucurui</LOCATION>
project in the <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> jungle.
   ``<ORGANIZATION>Itaipu</ORGANIZATION> only produces at <PERCENT>60 percent</PERCENT> of its capacity and we
don't even know what to do with so much energy,'' <PERSON>Lutzenberger</PERSON>
said. ``<LOCATION>Tucurui</LOCATION> generates electricity for large aluminum factories
that export minerals at low cost and the <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> natives don't see
any benefit.''
   <PERSON>Lutzenberger</PERSON> said <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> should scrap plans for large dams in
the rain forest and concentrate instead on promoting small
generators and floating river turbines financed and run by local
municipalities and private businessmen.
   The appointment of <PERSON>Lutzenberger</PERSON>, an agronomist educated in the
<LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, was seen as a victory for conservationists, who
claim <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> has traditionally done little to preserve the <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION>.
   ``There are many people who would like to see the jungle
disappear to raise cattle, but they won't do it with my approval,''
he said.

<LEADPARA>  MANY centuries ago, the Yanomami tribe of the northern Amazon said the Earth
was blue and covered by a thin layer. But the "civilized world" didn't believe
it until cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin saw from space that it was true. They also
said there was a hole in the sky.;    So explained Milton Nascimento to a
sell-out crowd at the Mountain View Center for Performing Arts on Sunday. But
this was no wake for our ravaged planet. It was a joyous celebration of life
by Brazil's most successful musical ambassador.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Living  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  BRAZILIAN CELEBRATES THE WEB OF LIFE  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Music Review  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Nascimento, a composer of gorgeous melodies with two voices to match -- a
lush baritone and an irresistible falsetto -- has an abiding faith that the
web of life for which the rain forest is a metaphor will survive. One could
see his great heart reaching to believe it, as he sang the love song to an
endangered people, "Yanomami e Nos" ("Yanomami and Us").;    Perched on a
stool and sporting his trademark floppy white cap, the 49-year-old pop
star-turned-environmental-crusader regaled the house with a nearly seamless
progression of undulating rhythms, soaring lyricism and just the right amount
of social consciousness.;    The singer from the desolate backlands of <ORGANIZATION>Minas
Gerais</ORGANIZATION> brought with him a powerhouse band of three drummer/percussionists
(<ORGANIZATION>Vanderlei</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Ronaldo</PERSON> and their father, <PERSON>Robertinho Silva</PERSON>); electric bassist <PERSON>Joao
Baptista</PERSON> and keyboardist <PERSON>Tulio Mourao</PERSON>. With Nascimento strumming an acoustic
guitar -- or conducting with his hands -- the six men produced an amazing
quantity of sound: delicate harmonies, rollicking anthems and explosive
percussion jams.;    Except for the (taped) introduction spoken by <LOCATION>River
Phoenix</LOCATION> from the current <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION> release, "Txai," there wasn't much English,
but the audience seemed to get the message.;    "They don't need our
language," <LOCATION>Phoenix</LOCATION> concludes in the narration, "to know we've sold them down
the river -- and franchised our own souls.";    That album was the fruit of an
18-day trip <PERSON>Nascimento</PERSON> and a team of anthropologists, musicologists and
ecologists made up the <LOCATION>Jurua River</LOCATION> from <LOCATION>Cruzeiro</LOCATION> do Sul in the Brazilian state
of Acre to the Peruvian border in <DATE>September 1989</DATE>. Because of sandbars, they
had to travel the last part of the way by canoe. That trip, the album and the
current tour -- which continues to <LOCATION>Berkeley</LOCATION>; <LOCATION>Vancouver</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>British Columbia</LOCATION>;
<LOCATION>Seattle</LOCATION>; <LOCATION>Austin</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>; <LOCATION>New Orleans</LOCATION>; <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> -- is part of a
campaign in support of the <LOCATION>Alianca</LOCATION> dos Povos da Floresta (Alliance for the
People of the Forest).;    We may think of the <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> as a single river, but
it has 1,000 tributaries, 17 of which are 1,000 miles long. Its 898,000 square
miles are home to 200,000 Indians. More than one-third of the tribes extant in
<DATE>1900</DATE> have vanished.;    "Txai" contains samples of indigenous music from the
<LOCATION>Yanomami</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Waiapi</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kayapo</LOCATION> and Paiter peoples. There wasn't much of that <DATE>Sunday</DATE>
<TIME>night</TIME>, although Nascimento sang "Nozani Na" in <LOCATION>Paiter.</LOCATION>;    <PERSON>Txai</PERSON>, a Kaxinawa
word originally expressing a kinship relation, has been adopted by the rubber
tappers, fishermen and other river people of Acre as an expression of respect
for all allies of the forest people. It translates as "companion" or "the
other half of me.";    <ORGANIZATION>Nascimento</ORGANIZATION> and his cohorts made all within earshot feel
that kinship <DATE>Sunday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>. "Yanomami," he said, "is life."; <PERSON>Milton Nascimento</PERSON>;

<FÊP=106> [Report by <PERSON>Marco Antonio Moreira</PERSON>] </F>
  [Text] <LOCATION>Brasilia</LOCATION>, 21 Jun (AE) -- To offset the setback 
suffered by Brazilian Ambassador to <LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION> <PERSON>Jose Aparecido de 
Oliveira</PERSON> over the last-minute cancellation of his trip to 
<LOCATION>Lisbon</LOCATION>, President <PERSON>Itamar Franco</PERSON> today asked former President 
<PERSON>Jose Sarney</PERSON> (who is a senator for the <ORGANIZATION>Brazilian Democratic 
Movement Party</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Amapa State</ORGANIZATION>) to head the Brazilian delegation to 
the Seminar on Economic and <ORGANIZATION>Entrepreneurial Cooperation</ORGANIZATION> and to 
the signing of the declaration creating the Community of 
Portuguese-speaking Countries (<ORGANIZATION>CPLP</ORGANIZATION>). 
  Sarney promptly accepted the invitation, which was extended 
personally by <ORGANIZATION>Franco</ORGANIZATION>. Sarney returned from <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> on 20 <DATE>June</DATE>. 
Today he stayed home recovering from labyrinthitis. At <DATE>1700</DATE> on 
22 <DATE>June</DATE>, <PERSON>Sarney</PERSON> will meet with the members of the Brazilian 
delegation to discuss details of the trip, which is scheduled to 
start on 24 <DATE>June</DATE>. Foreign Minister <PERSON>Celso Amorim</PERSON> has informed 
the <ORGANIZATION>Portuguese Government</ORGANIZATION> about the change. 
  Franco said by asking <PERSON>Sarney</PERSON> to head the delegation he was 
paying tribute to the presidents of <LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Angola</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Cape 
Verde</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Guinea-Bissau</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Sao Tome</LOCATION> and Principe 
because the first meeting aimed at creating the <ORGANIZATION>International 
Institute of the Portuguese Language</ORGANIZATION> with the attendance of the 
heads of state of these countries was held on 3 <DATE>November</DATE> [no 
year given] in <LOCATION>Sao Luiz</LOCATION> (<LOCATION>Maranhao</LOCATION>) and was organized by 
Ambassador <PERSON>de Oliveira</PERSON>, who was then culture minister of the 
<PERSON>Sarney</PERSON> government. 
  In a communique released <DATE>today</DATE> at <ORGANIZATION>Planalto Palace</ORGANIZATION>, the 
president states that despite having postponed his trip to 
<LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION>, he will visit that country before the end of his term 
to commemorate the creation of the <ORGANIZATION>CPLP</ORGANIZATION> and to resume bilateral 
talks with <ORGANIZATION>Portuguese Prime Minister Cavaco e Silva</ORGANIZATION>. The 
Brazilian delegation will include cabinet ministers, executives 
of state-owned companies, and private businessmen who will pay 
their own travel expenses. 
  Presidential Spokesman <PERSON>Fernando Costa</PERSON> has said <PERSON>Franco</PERSON>'s 
decision to postpone the trip was in no way related to the death 
of his nephew and private secretary <PERSON>Ariosto Franco</PERSON>, although the 
cancellation came after his death. "The president was shaken by 
<PERSON>Ariosto</PERSON>'s death," <PERSON>Costa</PERSON> said, "but he has chosen to stay in 
<LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> because he considers his presence necessary on the eve of 
the implementation of the real."

  [Text] Representatives from seven Portuguese-speaking 
countries are discussing in <LOCATION>Brasilia</LOCATION> the formation of an 
international community. They met this morning in <LOCATION>Itamaraty</LOCATION>. 
  These representatives came from <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>. They have 
something in common with <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>, their language -- Portuguese. 
Based on this common feature, the foreign ministers from seven 
countries are discussing the formation of a community of 
Portuguese- speaking countries to exchange technology and 
cooperation in the cultural, social, and economic areas and 
reach political agreements. 
  Brazilian Foreign Minister <PERSON>Celso Amorim</PERSON> emphasized the 
efforts made by these countries to end racism and the 
significance of the new community: 
  [Begin Amorim recording] We are living in a world of 
variable associations in which it is important to channel common 
elements for more resolute actions in the international arena. 
[end recording] 
  Brazilian Ambassador to <LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION> <PERSON>Jose Aparecido de Oliveira</PERSON>, 
one of the architects of the community of Portuguese-speaking 
countries, said it already was time for the idea to materialize 
and used the occasion to ask for the foreigners' support for 
proposing sociologist <PERSON>Herbert de Souza</PERSON>, nicknamed <PERSON>Betinho</PERSON>, as a 
candidate for the <ORGANIZATION>Nobel Peace Prize</ORGANIZATION>. 
  [Begin Aparecido recording] I believe he is the candidate of 
the nations that speak our language. In this regard, he 
represents the moral and human conscience of 210 million people 
scattered throughout the continents. [end recording] 
  The presidents of these seven Portuguese-speaking countries 
will meet this year in <LOCATION>Lisbon</LOCATION> to formalize all the documents 
signed at today's meeting. 
  The foreign ministers will visit the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> 
and <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> this afternoon. They will have dinner with 
President <PERSON>Itamar Franco</PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION>JK Memorial</ORGANIZATION> tonight.

<HEAD>Indian Chief: Brazilian Miners Invading Amazon Reserves</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JORGE MEDEROS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of gold prospectors expelled
from Yanomami Indian lands have invaded other <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> reserves and
spread malaria among the tribes, an Indian chief said <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   The claims were made as representatives from 12 indigenous
groups of the far-western <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> state of <LOCATION>Roraima</LOCATION> came to the
capital in search of medical aid. The Indian chiefs also want the
government to demarcate their lands and expel the miners.
   Makuxi chief <PERSON>Jaci</PERSON> said <DATE>Thursday</DATE> that about 8,000 gold miners
were spreading malaria among his 12,000-member tribe. The Makuxis,
mostly farmers, inhabit a large reserve near the Venezuelan border.
   The Indian leader said 154 of 990 Makuxi in four villages had
been infected the <DATE>last three months</DATE>. Five of those had died,
including his own wife.
   In addition, he said 122 ranchers had also occupied large tracts
of the <ORGANIZATION>Makuxi</ORGANIZATION> reserve, taking advantage of the lack of reserve
markings.
   Last <DATE>January</DATE>, the government ordered the miners off the reserve
of the Yanomamis, the world's largest primitive tribe. But since
then the prospectors have poured into a region near the <LOCATION>Guyana</LOCATION>
border in search of gold and diamonds, <PERSON>Jaci</PERSON> said.
   Neither the <ORGANIZATION>National Indian Foundation</ORGANIZATION> nor the <ORGANIZATION>Justice Ministry</ORGANIZATION>
would meet with the Indian chiefs on <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, <PERSON>Jaci</PERSON> said.
   The government has said it lacks the money needed to demarcate
the tribes' lands and remove the miners by force.
   ``All the medical attention is given to the Yanomamis. The
government has forgotten the rest of us,'' <PERSON>Jaci</PERSON> complained.
   The Yanomamis are also being decimated by diseases from about
40,000 gold prospectors who have flooded into the mineral-rich
region the last three years.
   <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Indian Missionary Council</ORGANIZATION>, sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION>Roman
Catholic Church</ORGANIZATION>, estimates that 1,500 of the remaining 9,000
Yanomamis have died in three years, most from malaria and sexual
diseases brought by miners. Some have died in conflicts with the
miners, the <ORGANIZATION>Council</ORGANIZATION> says.
   The Indians' medical situation has improved recently, according
to government officials, because of an emergency health campaign
that it says has cut the incidence of malaria in Indian villages
from <PERCENT>90 percent</PERCENT> to <PERCENT>18 percent</PERCENT>.
   Federal police have also begun ``Operation Free Yanomami
Jungle,'' to force the miners off the Indian lands. About 140
troops are dynamiting 120 clandestine landing strips cut in the
jungle and used to supply mining sites by air.
   <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>'s Indians have steadily dwindled in number since <DATE>1987</DATE>,
when the clandestine rush to the <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> began after government
studies indicated a wealth of gold, diamonds, tin and bauxite
there.
   Prospectors and landless peasants have leveled rain forests,
chased off fish and game, polluted rivers with mercury used in gold
panning, and spread diseases previously unknown to the tribes.
   There are about 215,000 native Indians left in <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>, down from
an estimated 5 million when the Portuguese landed here in <DATE>1500</DATE>.

<DATELINE>LISBON, Portugal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Seven Portuguese-speaking nations with a
total population of 185 million have agreed to adopt identical
spellings for their common language.
   <LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION>, its former African colonies - <LOCATION>Cape Verde</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Angola</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Guinea-Bissau</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Sao Tome</LOCATION> e Principe - and <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> hope
the controversial accord they signed <DATE>Sunday</DATE> will create a unified
market for Portuguese-language books and movies.
   The accord simplifies and harmonizes spellings of a wide list of
vocabulary. It also adds three new letters to the alphabet and
removes some accents and letters that are no longer spoken.
   But critics say the accord could muddle the tongue.
   When it takes full effect by the beginning of <DATE>1994</DATE>, some
Portuguese words with very different roots and meaning will be
spelled the same.

FT  17 JAN 92 / Technology: Operation Amazon - Christina Lamb describes
plans to put satellite images of the Brazilian rainforest on computer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Name the remotest part of the <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> rainforest to <PERSON>Diogenes Sales Alves</PERSON> and
with the flick of a few switches on his computer he can tell you how much if
any deforestation the area has suffered, when and how it happened, whether
it contains any Indian settlements, any mining or agricultural activity.
Alves is head of a research project at the <ORGANIZATION>Brazilian Aerospace Institute</ORGANIZATION>
(<ORGANIZATION>INPE</ORGANIZATION>) to compile from satellite images the first comprehensive analysis of
the world's largest rainforest. The project, detailing everything down to
the last nut gatherer, is expected to be completed by <DATE>April</DATE>. It is planned
to be one of the highlights of the <ORGANIZATION>UN Environment Conference</ORGANIZATION>, or <LOCATION>Earth
Summit</LOCATION> as it is known, which will be held in <LOCATION>Rio de Janeiro</LOCATION> in <DATE>June</DATE>.
Not only will the study enable examination of geological, hydrological and
botanical features (and changes caused by human activity) in the 5.2m sq km
of jungle, including areas which have never been penetrated, it will also
provide valuable information for some of today's most controversial
environmental debates such as whether forest burning is more detrimental to
climate change than automobile emissions.
In recognition of its work in using satellites to analyse the effect of
human development of the <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>INPE</ORGANIZATION> has been chosen to co-ordinate a study
of the world's forests for the <ORGANIZATION>Space Agencies Forum</ORGANIZATION>. The results will be
presented at the Earth Summit.
Surprisingly, <ORGANIZATION>INPE</ORGANIZATION> has only been studying the <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> for three years. 'In
<DATE>1988</DATE> when global warming became a general preoccupation the world started
wanting accurate information about the rate of Amazonian deforestation, so
we were asked by the Brazilian government to do a study,' explains <PERSON>Paulo
Serra</PERSON>, head of terrestrial observations.
Beginning in <DATE>April 1989</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>INPE</ORGANIZATION> devised a method using computer algorithms to
calculate yearly deforestation from remote sensing satellite images taken by
the American Landsat 5. Since <DATE>1984</DATE> the satellite has passed over the same
point every 16 days from a 710km high orbit. This means that it always
photographs Brazilian territory in the morning when cloud cover is still
extensive so it is not ideal.
The satellite images are received in <LOCATION>Cuiaba</LOCATION> in the west of <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> and
transmitted 1,400km to an <ORGANIZATION>INPE</ORGANIZATION> station at <LOCATION>Cachoeira</LOCATION> where they are processed
to generate photos. Landsat captures light reflected from the earth's
surface, producing an image on a scale of 1:250,000 in varying tones of
grey. The photographs are given artificial colours - green for forest,
darkening according to the density, pink for barren areas, grey for smoke
from burnings and blue for rivers and dams.
The best 229 photos in terms of clarity of those produced each year are
selected, each covering 185 sq km. Examination of these photographs was used
in <DATE>1989</DATE>, <DATE>1990</DATE> and <DATE>1991</DATE> to calculate the yearly rate of deforestation. But,
says Serra: 'We realised this was an enormous amount of work just to get one
number - so we decided to analyse the photos so that we can say when, where
and how an area was deforested.'
To do this <ORGANIZATION>INPE</ORGANIZATION> has developed its own geographic information system.
According to Serra: 'It is not very complicated - really just a matter of
common language on what is deforestation - there is a lot of area in the
<LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> which is neither rainforest nor deforestation.'
Now when the satellite photographs are taken to <ORGANIZATION>INPE</ORGANIZATION> headquarters at <LOCATION>Sao
Jose</LOCATION> dos Campos to be interpreted, the images are colour coded to represent
deforestation of different years. The resulting maps are fed into the
computer and can then be used not only to evaluate more accurately the rate
of deforestation but also to study its effect on carbon- and hydro-cycles.
Some 334 maps will be created to cover the whole area.
'Rather than simply having photos in archives, we can call up any area on
computer from which we can make 1,000 observations,' Serra explains. 'I can
pick a piece of land near <LOCATION>Manaus</LOCATION> and say that it suffered X amount of
deforestation in <DATE>1988</DATE> because of this, nothing in <DATE>1989</DATE> and Y amount in <DATE>1990</DATE>
because of something else. I can see what was deforested for agriculture,
for hydroelectric dams, for garimpagem (informal mining) or simply
disappeared, each of which has a different impact on the greenhouse effect.'
Other uses for the computerised maps include looking at areas inhabited by
<ORGANIZATION>Yanomami Indians</ORGANIZATION> and other indigenous tribes to see where their settlements
are and to follow their movements and discover where there have been
encroachments by garimpeiros or even cocaine smugglers building illegal
airstrips. The maps will be used for the zoning of the 9.4m hectares
recently declared a reserve for the Yanomamis.
Serra says the maps will also enable the study of the dynamics of forest
nutrients, in terms of soil, gases and the waterboard. It will look at how
deforestation has affected drainage and where streams have dried up because
of silt produced by mining or reduction of forest protection.
They should also end ambiguities in, for example, how much of the forest has
been destroyed and the efficacy of Brazilian government attempts to outlaw
burnings. The government environment agency claims that burnings were down
last year on the 14,000 sq km deforested in <DATE>1989-90</DATE>, but ecologists say they
are back at 1988-89 levels of 23,800 sq km.
The <ORGANIZATION>INPE</ORGANIZATION> team does not underestimate the importance of the project. 'Not
only are we creating the first ever Amazonian database which can be used by
the whole world but we may also resolve some long- running debates in
<LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>'s favour,' Serra claims.
With a sly smile, he adds: 'Imagine the enormous effect if we could show
through this that <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> burning has much less impact on the carbon cycle
and thus climate change than burning fossil fuels or running cars?'

   THE KARI-OCA INDIAN VILLAGE, RIO DE JANEIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE grounds of a mental asylum were the bizarre setting yesterday for the
first official event of the <ORGANIZATION>UN Conference on Environment and Development</ORGANIZATION>,
better known as the <ORGANIZATION>Earth Summit</ORGANIZATION>.
Aborigines, inuit (eskimos), North American Indians, tribal Africans and
Amazonian Indians in full paint and feathers gathered together in a mock
Indian village in the grounds of <ORGANIZATION>Curicica Mental Hospital</ORGANIZATION> on the hills
outside Rio de Janeiro for the first ever <ORGANIZATION>World Conference of Indigenous
People</ORGANIZATION>, much to the amusement of the inmates.
Most had come by aircraft and car, rejecting the grass huts of the Kari-oca
village built by Indians with authentic materials from the <LOCATION>Xingu National
Park</LOCATION>, in favour of air-conditioned hotels in the city.
Some 500 Indians from five continents will meet all week to discuss topics
such as biodiversity, intellectual property and sustainable development, to
prepare a document to be presented to <PERSON>Mr Maurice Strong</PERSON>, secretary general
of the <ORGANIZATION>Earth Summit</ORGANIZATION>.
According to <PERSON>Mr Marcos Terena</PERSON>, a Brazilian Indian chief co-ordinating the
conference, the aim is 'to ensure that indigenous people have a voice' in
the official summit which starts next <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, and are not 'just
considered in folkloric terms'.
Specific concerns include recognition of intellectual property rights for
use of medicinal plants from Indian areas, sovereignty rights and deciding
on a position for the 500th anniversary of the European discovery of the
Americas.
<PERSON>Mr Donald Rocas</PERSON>, an Indian from <LOCATION>Costa Rica</LOCATION>, says: 'This conference is
fundamental because it deals with all our lives - not just those of
indigenous people but also non-indigenous who need to learn from us how to
look after land and resources crucial for the planet's survival.'
Ms <PERSON>Helen Corbett</PERSON>, who is leading an Aborigine delegation from <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>,
says: 'The main issue for us is sovereignty for aborigines to prevent
destruction of our land and death of our people.'
However, there is doubt over how representative the conference delegates
are. Brazilian Indians spoken to in <LOCATION>Para</LOCATION> and Amazonas over the last month
were completely unaware of the event and expressed interest in visiting Rio.
The Earth Summit will be the first big post-cold-war conference, with around
18 new European countries in attendance. <PERSON>Mr Marcos Azambuja</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>'s chief
negotiator, describes it as 'the most important non-confrontational
conference since <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> in <DATE>1945</DATE>'.
Over the <DATE>weekend</DATE> the 10m residents of Rio had their first taste of what is
to come with the testing of security operations, which brought traffic to a
complete standstill and caused some panicked residents to think a military
coup had been launched. Some 6,000 army officers patrolled the streets in
tanks with heavy arms, practising for the summit, at which about 125 heads
of state are expected.
One of the leaders of the Brazilian delegation complained after being tailed
by three riflemen: 'The military seem to be taking things to extremes - are
we really going to open tank fire if any problems emerge ?'
For those concerned about pickpockets, Rio's most famous escaped British
train robber, <PERSON>Ronald Biggs</PERSON>, is giving security hints on a daily radio
programme throughout the conference.

the <ORGANIZATION>Rio Group</ORGANIZATION> presidential summit next <DATE>September</DATE>. The group is 
mainly discussing the social-economic development in the region, 
as explained by Brazilian Foreign Minister <PERSON>Celso Amorim</PERSON>. 
  [Begin Amorim recording] The subjects are democracy, human 
rights, sustained development, and science and technology. This 
meeting obviously cannot exhaust all subjects, because it is 
merely the preparation for a process that will conclude with a 
presidential summit in <DATE>September</DATE>. Beside economic and social 
development, as well as poverty -- which are essential subjects 
-- I believe we will also discuss the possibility of a consensus 
on the hemispheric conference. [end recording] 
  The election of the next <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> secretary general is another 
subject to be discussed in this <ORGANIZATION>Rio Group</ORGANIZATION> meeting.

<HEAD>Brazil to Remove Gold Miners from Amazon Land</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has announced a <MONEY>$4
million</MONEY> operation to remove tens of thousands of illegal gold
miners from the <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> jungle lands of the <ORGANIZATION>Yanomami Indians</ORGANIZATION>, one of
the world's largest primitive tribes.
   The operation is a response to an international outcry to
protect the Yanomamis from disease and violence brought by the
miners, said the <ORGANIZATION>National Indian Office</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Brasilia</LOCATION>, the capital.
   ``We're backed by a presidential decree and humanitarian
reasons. The miners will be removed by force if necessary,'' Col.
<PERSON>Airton Alcantara Gomes</PERSON>, No. 2 at the <ORGANIZATION>Indian Office</ORGANIZATION>, said in a
telephone interview.
   About 40,000 clandestine miners are believed to have invaded
<ORGANIZATION>Yanomami</ORGANIZATION> lands in the remote northwestern state of <LOCATION>Roraima</LOCATION>, near
<LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>'s border with <LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION>. Some 9,000 Yanomamis live in the
region, which is rich in gold, tin and diamonds.
   ``Mining is an evil, and not even a necessary evil,'' <PERSON>Gomes</PERSON>
said. ``It pollutes the rivers, destroys the rain forest and
devastates Indian tribes.'' The operation is to start <DATE>Sunday</DATE> with
the closing of air strips near <LOCATION>Boa Vista</LOCATION>, the capital of <LOCATION>Roraima</LOCATION>.
Only four strips will be kept open for official use, he said.
   ``Small planes are the main means of bringing in food, supplies,
fuel, guns, alcohol, drugs, everything. We'll even seize planes if
necessary,'' <PERSON>Gomes</PERSON> said.
   About 400 federal police, <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> and Indian Office agents
then will comb the jungle to find and remove prospectors, he said.
   <PERSON>Gomes</PERSON> said government agents expected to face violent resistance
from some miners, instigated by the controllers of the mining sites.
   ``The only ones who profit from gold mining are a half dozen big
controllers and a few airplane owners. The benefit for the country
is zero, because most of the gold is smuggled out,'' he said.
   The removal is expected to take 60 days. Federal police will be
permanently stationed in the region to prevent miners from
returning, <PERSON>Gomes</PERSON> said.
   In a separate operation, five medical teams from the <ORGANIZATION>Health
Ministry</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Indian Office</ORGANIZATION> began visiting Yanomami villages to
treat a growing outbreak of disease.
   ``Because of the presence of the miners, many Indians have
malaria, tuberculosis and venereal diseases. There also is a lot of
malnutrition, because fish and game have disappeared from some
areas,'' <PERSON>Gomes</PERSON> said.
   Traveling by helicopter and on foot, the medical teams are to
visit every <ORGANIZATION>Yanomami</ORGANIZATION> village in 45 days and distribute 8,140 pounds
of medicine and supplies, he said.
   Environmental and Indian defense groups in <DATE>November</DATE> told the
nation's <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> that 280 Yanomamis had died since <DATE>1987</DATE>. About <PERCENT>70
percent</PERCENT> of the tribal land, which originally covered 22 million
acres, has been made into national forests and parks.
   Defenders of the <ORGANIZATION>Yanomami</ORGANIZATION> cause include British rock star Sting
and Indian chief <PERSON>Davi Kopenawa</PERSON>, winner of a <ORGANIZATION>United Nations Global</ORGANIZATION>
500 award in <DATE>1988</DATE> for defense of the environment.
   There are about 220,000 native Indians left in <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>, down from
an estimated 5 million when the country was discovered by the
Portuguese in <DATE>1500</DATE>.

<FÊP=106> [Report by <PERSON>Elsy Fors</PERSON>] </F>
  [Text] <LOCATION>Havana</LOCATION>, 25 Jan (PL) -- Under the banner of 
indispensable unity and continental integration, the fourth 
Latin American and <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> meeting got under way with the 
presence of President <PERSON>Fidel Castro</PERSON> and 1,000 delegates from all 
the countries of the region. 
  Indian leaders, politicians, intellectuals, professionals, 
and believers of the most varied religions of all the countries 
of the hemisphere, including the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>, have 
heeded the summons to this meeting for the solidarity, 
sovereignty, self- determination, and lives of our peoples. 
  The Cuban president, who heads the host delegation, received 
the acclamation of the participants at the meeting, which will 
conclude on <DATE>Friday</DATE>, 28 <DATE>January</DATE>. 
  Representatives from previous host countries of the forum -- 
<LOCATION>Ecuador</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Colombia</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> -- spoke during the inaugural 
session and concurred in calling for the unity of regional 
progressive forces, the integration of their countries, and 
solidarity with <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION>. 
  <PERSON>Camilo Restrepo</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Ecuador</LOCATION> referred to the extremely grave 
economic situation of the majority of the Latin American 
population, where poverty is on the increase due to the effects 
of neoliberal economic policies. 
  In turn, Colombian <PERSON>Ivan Foredo</PERSON> said those attending this 
meeting were the genuine heirs of <LOCATION>Latin America</LOCATION>'s struggle for 
liberty, and he called on them to speak out against the inhuman 
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> blockade against <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION>, who maintains, he added, the 
socialist program more than ever. 
  <PERSON>Amir Lando</PERSON>, senator for the <ORGANIZATION>Brazilian Democratic Movement 
Party</ORGANIZATION>, stated solidarity stresses the need to be organized. We 
have the capacity and the duty, he stated, to make our 
convictions reach our peoples. 
  The Brazilian legislator compared Cuban health indicators to 
<LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>'s, where the life expectancy is 58 years in comparison to 
75 years in <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION>, and where the infant mortality rate is 69 for 
very 1,000 live births as opposed to 9.5 in <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION>. 
  Regarding the Brazilian experience in the implementation of 
neoliberal adjustments, <PERSON>Lando</PERSON> said the privatization process, 
far from replacing state enterprises with a policy of 
development, had exchanged state monopolies for private business 
monopolies that take away the country's wealth. 
  <PERSON>Jose Ramon Balaguer</PERSON>, Politburo member of the <ORGANIZATION>Communist Party</ORGANIZATION> 
of <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION> and head of the <ORGANIZATION>Ideological Department</ORGANIZATION>, spoke on behalf 
of <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION>, stressing the complex international panorama in which 
the meeting is being held. 
  He indicated a decade of changes born under an adverse sign 
of unipolar power began not long ago. He noted that within this 
context, <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION> feels capable of making its own alternatives. 
  Referring to the difficult economic situation in the 
country, 
<PERSON>Balaguer</PERSON> said the road to recovery has begun, albeit slowly, 
mostly because of the impact of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> embargo, which has 
lasted more than three decades. 
  The Cuban leader called on the participants to strive for 
unity because there will be no future without unity and 
integration. This afternoon, the forum is expected to begin 
debating in four commissions, namely, political, economic, 
cultural, and organizational commissions. On 27 <DATE>January</DATE>, groups 
will contact unions, Indians, women, religious groups, community 
organizations, friendship and solidarity with <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION> associations, 
intellectuals, artists, and legislators. On <DATE>Friday</DATE>, the 
participants will return to the plenum where they will report on 
the work done by the committees and close the meeting with a 
party at the <ORGANIZATION>Panamerican Villa</ORGANIZATION>, east of <LOCATION>Havana</LOCATION>.

  [Text] The AIDS virus has now stricken 13 million adults 
and a million children worldwide: 2.5 million people have AIDS. 
World Health Organization (WHO) projections indicate that, by 
the end of the <DATE>1990</DATE>'s, there will be 43 million infected people 
in the world. Moreover, 10 million children will be left orphans 
of parents who were victims of the disease. "AIDS is one of the 
most serious problems confronted by the human race," declared 
<PERSON>Lair Guerra de Macedo</PERSON>, coordinator of the <ORGANIZATION>Health Ministry</ORGANIZATION>'s 
Program To Fight AIDS, yesterday. She spoke during the course of 
the World Day To Combat AIDS program, in which health ministers 
have participated since <DATE>1985</DATE>, when the program was created. 
  In <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>, the statistics from <DATE>1980</DATE> until 30 <DATE>October</DATE> of this 
year show an accumulation of 43,964 AIDS cases, revealing that 
<PERCENT>41 percent</PERCENT> of those infected have already died. There are 
420,000 Brazilians with HIV. It is expected that, during the 
next two years, 87,000 new cases will appear, and that there 
will be 85,000 deaths resulting from the disease. According to 
estimates, within the same period the government will spend <MONEY>$875 
million</MONEY> on patients in an advanced stage alone. Lair claimed 
that the government will attempt to reduce the infection levels 
over the next three years, based on a comprehensive AIDS control 
program financed by the <ORGANIZATION>World Bank</ORGANIZATION>. The program cost is <MONEY>$250 
million</MONEY>, with <MONEY>$90 million</MONEY> in matching funds from the <ORGANIZATION>Brazilian 
Government</ORGANIZATION>. 
  According to <ORGANIZATION>Lair Guerra</ORGANIZATION>, a striking feature in <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> is 
the 
spread of the disease among various population groups, such as 
women and young people. The expert warned: "The use of 
injectable drugs is playing a preponderant role in the spread of 
the disease among the youth." In <DATE>1980</DATE>, there were 28 cases among 
adolescents; and in <DATE>1991</DATE>, 261 cases were recorded, with <PERCENT>50 
percent</PERCENT> infected through drug use. During the government's 
informational campaign disseminated by radio and television, it 
had been planned to air a video instructing the drug user on how 
to disinfect needles and syringes, but the film was banned. Two 
films will be aired promoting the use of condoms, and there will 
be two radio spots providing information on the disease.

<HEAD>Brazilian Army Dynamites Clandestine Airstrips in Amazon Jungle</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JORGE MEDEROS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> began
dynamiting the first of 110 clandestine airstrips cut by gold
miners on <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> jungle lands inhabited by the <ORGANIZATION>Yanomami Indians</ORGANIZATION>,
the world's largest primitive tribe.
   More than 250 army soldiers, air force officials and federal
police blew up the first airstrip <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, a 600-yard runway in
the tropical rain forest near the Venezuelan and Guyanan borders.
   The military used 374 pounds of explosives to blast open 40
holes, each 13 feet in diameter and four feet deep, said <ORGANIZATION>Federal
Police</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>Joao Martins</PERSON>.
   The rest of the airstrips will be destroyed before <DATE>May 18</DATE> to
prevent the 40,000 prospectors from returning to Indian lands,
<PERSON>Martins</PERSON> said in a telephone interview.
   He said the work will cost <MONEY>$800,000</MONEY>.
   President <PERSON>Fernando Collor de Mello</PERSON> ordered the destruction of
the airstrips following a visit to the <ORGANIZATION>Yanomami</ORGANIZATION> reservation soon
after he took office on <DATE>March 15</DATE>.
   In addition to evacuating the miners, who first invaded the 1
million acre reserve in <DATE>1987</DATE>, <PERSON>Collor</PERSON> promised to blow up the
illegal landing strips to stop planes from supplying the miners and
transporting gold and diamonds.
   <PERSON>Martins</PERSON> said two airstrips will be left intact for the <ORGANIZATION>National
Indian Foundation</ORGANIZATION> and the army, which maintains border outposts in
the region to combat drug trafficking and smuggling along <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>'s
4,000-mile northern frontier.
   He said troops seized one small plane loaded with cocaine on the
airstrip just before the dynamiting operation began. Police say
drug traffickers used the clandestine airstrips as transhipment
points between <LOCATION>Colombia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Bolivia</LOCATION>.
   The rush to <ORGANIZATION>Yanomami</ORGANIZATION> territory began three years ago after
government studies revealed the presence of gold, diamonds, tin and
bauxite in the region.
   Prospectors flocked to the area, leveling rain forests, chasing
off fish and game, polluting rivers with mercury used in gold
panning and spreading diseases previously unknown to the isolated
tribe.
   Since <DATE>1987</DATE>, the tribe has dwindled from about 9,000 to 7,500,
due to malnutrition, venereal diseases and malaria. Others have
been killed in clashes with miners.
   Under international pressure, the government of former President
<PERSON>Jose Sarney</PERSON> announced a <MONEY>$4 million</MONEY> campaign in early <DATE>January</DATE> to
expel the prospectors, by force if necessary.
   There are about 220,000 native Indians left in <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>, down from
an estimated 5 million when the Portuguese first landed here in
<DATE>1500</DATE>.
   The government has been steadily carving up Indian lands,
leaving the Yanomamis 19 scattered reservations totaling 5 million
acres in <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>'s northwest <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> territory.

<FÊP=106> [Article by <ORGANIZATION>Carlos MacArthur</ORGANIZATION>: "PF Lacks Money for Monitoring </F>
Amazon Region"] 
  [Text] The <ORGANIZATION>Federal Police</ORGANIZATION> [PF] need <MONEY>$248 million</MONEY> with which 
to carry out protective actions and stimulate sustainable 
development in the <LOCATION>Amazon Region</LOCATION>. The program's objectives 
include combating conflicts with Indians, land conflicts, the 
drug traffic, smuggling, and illegal mining. Since repression of 
those crimes is the exclusive duty of the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Police</ORGANIZATION>, that 
force's leadership is seeking external funds. 
  The <ORGANIZATION>Amazon Region</ORGANIZATION> is currently a genuine open border, 
according to Superintendent <PERSON>Mauro Sposito</PERSON>, because the PF's 
activity in the region is totally impaired by the lack of a 
surveillance, inspection, and monitoring system. For that 
reason, the superintendent points out, agents are being trained 
to work with experts from the <ORGANIZATION>Ministry of Communications</ORGANIZATION> in 
operating mobile radio stations that can trace conversations 
taking place in the region's isolated locations between the 
Colombian and Bolivian drug cartels. 
  The <ORGANIZATION>Federal Police</ORGANIZATION> are aware that the <LOCATION>Amazon Region</LOCATION> is 
currently the gateway through which drugs enter <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>. The fact 
is that since the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> invasion of <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> in <DATE>1990</DATE>, <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> has 
become the preferred route for traffickers who once used the 
"Caribbean route." The lack of suitable equipment puts the PF at 
a disadvantage, and seizures do not exceed <PERCENT>5 percent</PERCENT> of the 
total volume moving through the country. Sposito points out that 
in a survey by <ORGANIZATION>Interpol</ORGANIZATION>, it is estimated that the drug 
traffickers have annual revenues of <MONEY>$500 billion</MONEY> just from the 
sale of cocaine all over the world. 
  Because of the high prices generated by cocaine, the product 
has created a real chain of crime all around it, the 
superintendent explains. It is money from drug trafficking that 
finances kidnappings, auto thefts, smuggling, and even bank 
holdups. On that subject, the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Police</ORGANIZATION> draw a parallel by 
emphasizing that when an operation to repress key points in the 
drug traffic is intensified, the response by the gangs is almost 
immediate in the form of an increased number of bank holdups. 
"All one need do is remember that case in <LOCATION>Rio de Janeiro</LOCATION> where a 
joint operation was mounted by the PF and the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION>. News of 
those operations and two raids by the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> in one of the 
shantytowns harmed the drug traffic, and two banks were held up 
right after that." 
  Federal Police officials say that the PF now has a wealth of 
information and maps concerning the activity of drug traffickers 
in the <LOCATION>Amazon Region</LOCATION> and even of illegal gold mines and other 
mines. 
<H5>  Tracking Crime </H5>
  Mapping work has made it possible to identify operators of 
illegal mines who join with drug traffickers to invade Indian 
lands. Once the Indians are evicted, both sides profit from the 
mining of minerals and the construction of clandestine landing 
strips. Approximately <PERCENT>90 percent</PERCENT> of the gold produced in <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> 
is smuggled out. 
  Pro-Amazon Region: By implementing the project scheduled for 
the start of <DATE>1994</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Federal Police</ORGANIZATION> hope to reduce those crime 
levels considerably. The project calls for opening 54 police 
stations in the region over the next four years, hiring new 
agents, and providing the units with suitable equipment, as well 
as cooperating with international scientific communities in the 
fields of chemistry, biochemistry, botany, and animal husbandry. 
Beginning in <DATE>January</DATE>, the Advanced Training, Study, and <ORGANIZATION>Research 
Center</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Manaus</LOCATION> will receive 160 agents for training. 
  To speed up and debureaucratize its activities, the PF is 
going to divide the <LOCATION>Amazon Region</LOCATION> into three sections. One of 
the operational centers--in <LOCATION>Manaus</LOCATION>--will cover the states of 
Amazonas and <LOCATION>Roraima</LOCATION>. The center in <LOCATION>Belem</LOCATION> will be responsible 
for the states of <LOCATION>Amapa</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Maranhao</LOCATION>, and the third center, in 
<LOCATION>Porto Velho</LOCATION>, will take care of Acre, <ORGANIZATION>Mato Grosso</ORGANIZATION>, and <LOCATION>Rondonia</LOCATION>. 
The <ORGANIZATION>PF</ORGANIZATION>'s operations will also involve <ORGANIZATION>Ibama</ORGANIZATION> [<ORGANIZATION>Brazilian Institute</ORGANIZATION> 
for the Environment], <ORGANIZATION>Funai</ORGANIZATION> [<ORGANIZATION>National Indian Foundation</ORGANIZATION>], and 
<ORGANIZATION>Incra</ORGANIZATION> [<ORGANIZATION>National Land Reform and Settlement Institute</ORGANIZATION>].

<TEXT>
   In a quiet, though dramatic,
reversal of policy, <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> is now accepting foreign offers of help
to save the <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> wilderness, the world's largest, from destruction.
   The government, which early this year rebuffed a <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION>
proposal to swap some of its <MONEY>$112-billion</MONEY> foreign debt for
investments in <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> protection programs, recently told <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION> it would work with them to curb damage, mostly by
burning, to the huge rain forest.
   In <DATE>August</DATE>, <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> accepted Italian and Canadian planes for local
authorities to police the jungle. Then it said yes to a project
backed by the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION> and by private American companies to
establish a 1.1 million-acre protected forest area to produce rubber
and nuts.
   The moves represent a sharp reversal in President <PERSON>Jose Sarney</PERSON>'s
<LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> policy, which in the past considered offers by foreigners as
attempts to take control of the rain forest from <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>.
   ``We cannot accept this form of colonialism which they want to
create here,'' <PERSON>Sarney</PERSON> told reporters in <DATE>March</DATE>, after <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, the
<LOCATION>Netherlands</LOCATION> and two <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> congressional delegations suggested trading
some Brazilian foreign debt, the Third World's largest, for <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION>
preservation.
   But analysts say subtle shifts in political, social and economic
spheres are forcing the government to change its mind.
   ``A bit of the persecution complex that took over the government,
which led to xenophobic and irrational behavior, is being overcome,
opening the road to new initiatives,'' wrote the Brazilian physicist
<PERSON>Jose Goldemberg</PERSON> in the O Estado de <LOCATION>Sao Paulo</LOCATION> newspaper recently.
   There is belief here that <PERSON>Sarney</PERSON>, widely discredited for his
inability to check <PERCENT>1,004 percent</PERCENT> annual inflation, talked tough in
the past to placate right-wing supporters.
   But with his center-right <ORGANIZATION>Brazilian Democratic Movement Party</ORGANIZATION> in
splinters and the country's first popular presidential election
since <DATE>1960</DATE> set for <DATE>Nov. 15</DATE>, <PERSON>Sarney</PERSON> might now be resigned to accept
foreign aid, the analysts say.
   ``What you have is a lame-duck government that lacks the
legitimacy to start new initiatives and push them through
<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON>Rene Dreifuss</PERSON>, a political scientist at the <ORGANIZATION>Fluminense
University in Rio</ORGANIZATION>, told <ORGANIZATION>The Associated Press</ORGANIZATION>. ``It has no choice but
to accept help from abroad.''
   Equally important, the hostility marking the issue has undermined
<LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>'s trade links abroad.
   ``It started to become taboo to do business in the <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION>,'' <PERSON>Sen.
Leopoldo Peres</PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION>Democratic Movement</ORGANIZATION> and president of
a <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> committee on <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> deforestation, said in an interview.
``American and European banks and lending organizations started
hesitating on financing industrial projects in the jungle.''
   Environmentalists pressured the <ORGANIZATION>European Economic Community</ORGANIZATION> to
ban imports of iron ore produced at the Greater Carajas project, a
huge metallurgy project in <LOCATION>Para</LOCATION>, a state in the <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> region.
   Recently, trade officials from <LOCATION>Belgium</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>
visited the 200 million-acre, <MONEY>$70 billion</MONEY> project, where thousands
of acres of virgin forest southwest of the mouth of the <LOCATION>Amazon River</LOCATION>
are being burned for the charcoal needed to process ore.
   A <ORGANIZATION>Rio de Janeiro</ORGANIZATION> city councilman, <PERSON>Alfredo Sirkis</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>'s
<ORGANIZATION>Green Party</ORGANIZATION>, contends Sarney first stiffened on the <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> issue
under a barrage of international news coverage of the shooting death
of the acclaimed union leader and ecologist Francisco ``Chico''
<PERSON>Mendes</PERSON>.
   <PERSON>Mendes</PERSON>, who fought to keep cattle ranchers from cutting down the
forest for pasture, was killed last <DATE>December</DATE> outside his modest home
in a backwoods <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> town.
   ``All of a sudden <PERSON>Chico</PERSON> was all over the front pages, and <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
senators were showing up to talk about saving the <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION>,'' <PERSON>Sirkis</PERSON>
said. ``It irritated the military, and <PERSON>Sarney</PERSON> reacted by turning it
into a sovereignty issue.''
   But the British rock star Sting met with <PERSON>Sarney</PERSON> in <DATE>January</DATE> and
received permission to begin a worldwide campaign to raise funds for
an Indian reservation.
   In <DATE>February</DATE>, Indian tribes of the eastern <LOCATION>Amazon Basin</LOCATION> organized
the first national tribal conference, with a goal of blocking <ORGANIZATION>World
Bank</ORGANIZATION> loans for a series of hydroelectric dams planned for the <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION>
region.
   These efforts added to a growing worldwide concern that
uncontrolled tree burning in the <MONEY>2 million</MONEY> square-mile <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> forest
_ for farming, ranching, highway building and mining _ was changing
global weather patterns.
   Environmentalists contend deforestation of the <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> also is
destroying unique plant and animal life, much of it unstudied, and
eliminating a major source of oxygen for the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s atmosphere.
   Satellite surveys show that more than <PERCENT>5 percent</PERCENT> of <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>'s rain
forest has been cut and burned. Some scientists say this adds carbon
to the atmosphere and helps cause the global warming trend known as
the greenhouse effect.
   By <DATE>April</DATE>, the first visible sign of change came when <PERSON>Sarney</PERSON>
announced a multimillion-dollar plan to preserve the rain forest.
   His ``Our Nature'' project extended the suspension of tax
incentives for ranchers and created a special police force to fight
the burning. It also established new forest and Indian reservations
and an Environmental Fund, banned timber exports, and controlled the
sale of mercury, which is indiscriminately dumped into Amazon-area
rivers by freelance gold prospectors.
   ``When the hysteria in the press and the government faded, the
nationalist jingo turned to apolitical dialogue,'' <PERSON>Flavio Feldmann</PERSON>
of the <ORGANIZATION>Brazilian Social Democratic Party</ORGANIZATION>, a vocal ecology defender,
told a reporter.
   On <DATE>July 5</DATE>, Foreign Minister <PERSON>Roberto Abreu</PERSON> de Sodre signed a
memorandum of understanding with <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> to tackle ``urban and
industrial environmental problems, control of marine pollution, and
forestry management.''
   ``This cooperation does not affect the sovereign right of states
to administer their natural heritage,'' said <PERSON>Abreu</PERSON> de Sodre.
   In <DATE>August</DATE>, <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> accepted <MONEY>$65.5 million</MONEY> in grants and loans from
<LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION> for conservation projects in the <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> over three
years.
   After this, the <ORGANIZATION>Inter-American Development Bank</ORGANIZATION> said it would
study the creation of a new fund for environmental projects in <LOCATION>Latin
America</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION>.
   Many Brazilian politicians now say the country will open up more
to foreign technological and financial help, although some seemingly
remain wary of the so-called ``sovereignty issue.''
   But <PERSON>Christopher Patten</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s minister of overseas
development, a recent visitor to <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>, said, ``Environmental
problems are ... the world's problem, which has to be solved by
cooperation and not throwing bricks at each other.''

   ``A bit of the persecution complex that took over the government,
which led to xenophobic and irrational behavior, is being overcome,
opening the road to new initiatives,'' wrote the Brazilian physicist
<PERSON>Jose Goldemberg</PERSON> in the O Estado de <LOCATION>Sao Paulo</LOCATION> newspaper recently.
   There is belief here that <PERSON>Sarney</PERSON>, widely discredited for his
inability to check <PERCENT>1,004 percent</PERCENT> annual inflation, talked tough in
the past to placate right-wing supporters.
   But with his center-right <ORGANIZATION>Brazilian Democratic Movement Party</ORGANIZATION> in
splinters and the country's first popular presidential election
since <DATE>1960</DATE> set for <DATE>Nov. 15</DATE>, <PERSON>Sarney</PERSON> might now be resigned to accept
foreign aid, the analysts say.
   ``What you have is a lame-duck government that lacks the
legitimacy to start new initiatives and push them through
<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON>Rene Dreifuss</PERSON>, a political scientist at the <ORGANIZATION>Fluminense
University in Rio</ORGANIZATION>, told <ORGANIZATION>The Associated Press</ORGANIZATION>. ``It has no choice but
to accept help from abroad.''
   Equally important, the hostility marking the issue has undermined
<LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>'s trade links abroad.
   ``It started to become taboo to do business in the <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION>,'' <PERSON>Sen.
Leopoldo Peres</PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION>Democratic Movement</ORGANIZATION> and president of
a <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> committee on <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> deforestation, said in an interview.
``American and European banks and lending organizations started
hesitating on financing industrial projects in the jungle.''
   Environmentalists pressured the <ORGANIZATION>European Economic Community</ORGANIZATION> to
ban imports of iron ore produced at the Greater Carajas project, a
huge metallurgy project in <LOCATION>Para</LOCATION>, a state in the <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> region.
   Recently, trade officials from <LOCATION>Belgium</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>
visited the 200 million-acre, <MONEY>$70 billion</MONEY> project, where thousands
of acres of virgin forest southwest of the mouth of the <LOCATION>Amazon River</LOCATION>
are being burned for the charcoal needed to process ore.
   A <ORGANIZATION>Rio de Janeiro</ORGANIZATION> city councilman, <PERSON>Alfredo Sirkis</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>'s
<ORGANIZATION>Green Party</ORGANIZATION>, contends Sarney first stiffened on the <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> issue
under a barrage of international news coverage of the shooting death
of the acclaimed union leader and ecologist Francisco ``Chico''
<PERSON>Mendes</PERSON>.
   <PERSON>Mendes</PERSON>, who fought to keep cattle ranchers from cutting down the
forest for pasture, was killed last <DATE>December</DATE> outside his modest home
in a backwoods <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> town.
   ``All of a sudden <PERSON>Chico</PERSON> was all over the front pages, and <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
senators were showing up to talk about saving the <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION>,'' <PERSON>Sirkis</PERSON>
said. ``It irritated the military, and <PERSON>Sarney</PERSON> reacted by turning it
into a sovereignty issue.''
   But the British rock star Sting met with <PERSON>Sarney</PERSON> in <DATE>January</DATE> and
received permission to begin a worldwide campaign to raise funds for
an Indian reservation.
   In <DATE>February</DATE>, Indian tribes of the eastern <LOCATION>Amazon Basin</LOCATION> organized
the first national tribal conference, with a goal of blocking <ORGANIZATION>World
Bank</ORGANIZATION> loans for a series of hydroelectric dams planned for the <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION>
region.
   These efforts added to a growing worldwide concern that
uncontrolled tree burning in the <MONEY>2 million</MONEY> square-mile <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> forest
_ for farming, ranching, highway building and mining _ was changing
global weather patterns.
   Environmentalists contend deforestation of the <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> also is
destroying unique plant and animal life, much of it unstudied, and
eliminating a major source of oxygen for the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s atmosphere.
   Satellite surveys show that more than <PERCENT>5 percent</PERCENT> of <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>'s rain
forest has been cut and burned. Some scientists say this adds carbon
to the atmosphere and helps cause the global warming trend known as
the greenhouse effect.
   By <DATE>April</DATE>, the first visible sign of change came when <PERSON>Sarney</PERSON>
announced a multimillion-dollar plan to preserve the rain forest.
   His ``Our Nature'' project extended the suspension of tax
incentives for ranchers and created a special police force to fight
the burning. It also established new forest and Indian reservations
and an Environmental Fund, banned timber exports, and controlled the
sale of mercury, which is indiscriminately dumped into Amazon-area
rivers by freelance gold prospectors.
   ``When the hysteria in the press and the government faded, the
nationalist jingo turned to apolitical dialogue,'' <PERSON>Flavio Feldmann</PERSON>
of the <ORGANIZATION>Brazilian Social Democratic Party</ORGANIZATION>, a vocal ecology defender,
told a reporter.
   On <DATE>July 5</DATE>, Foreign Minister <PERSON>Roberto Abreu</PERSON> de Sodre signed a
memorandum of understanding with <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> to tackle ``urban and
industrial environmental problems, control of marine pollution, and
forestry management.''
   ``This cooperation does not affect the sovereign right of states
to administer their natural heritage,'' said <PERSON>Abreu</PERSON> de Sodre.
   In <DATE>August</DATE>, <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> accepted <MONEY>$65.5 million</MONEY> in grants and loans from
<LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION> for conservation projects in the <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> over three
years.
   After this, the <ORGANIZATION>Inter-American Development Bank</ORGANIZATION> said it would
study the creation of a new fund for environmental projects in <LOCATION>Latin
America</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION>.
   Many Brazilian politicians now say the country will open up more
to foreign technological and financial help, although some seemingly
remain wary of the so-called ``sovereignty issue.''
   But <PERSON>Christopher Patten</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s minister of overseas
development, a recent visitor to <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>, said, ``Environmental
problems are ... the world's problem, which has to be solved by
cooperation and not throwing bricks at each other.''

  [Text] In the Venezuelan city of <ORGANIZATION>La Guaira</ORGANIZATION>, the presidents 
of <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION> released a joint communique <TIME>this 
afternoon</TIME>, confirming the two countries' goal of giving new 
impetus to their economic and political relations. 
  [Begin journalist <PERSON>Antonio Carlos Silva</PERSON> recording] At the 
official residence of La Guzmania here in <LOCATION>La Guaira</LOCATION>, 30 km from 
<LOCATION>Caracas</LOCATION>, the presidents of <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Itamar Franco</PERSON> 
and <PERSON>Rafael Caldera</PERSON> respectively, released a joint communique 
<TIME>this afternoon</TIME>, confirming the two countries' political 
willingness to give new impetus 4o their bilateral relations. 
As part of this effort, they decided to form a bilateral 
commission, chaired by the foreign ministers of the two 
countries, to raise common issues. This commission will form 
work groups to design projects in the electrical, highway, 
hydrographical, mining, iron and steel, and environmental fields. 
  The presidents of <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION> proposed that the 
ministers involved in the commercial area speed up the 
preparations for signing an economic accord. 
  They discussed the Brazilian proposal to create a free trade 
zone, without excluding other current regional integration 
mechanisms, and decided to continue their talks on this issue. 
  The two presidents also proposed discussing ways to increase 
Brazilian purchases of Venezuelan oil. They agreed to promote 
efforts to develop the border areas, especially the Indian 
communities. 
  The joint communique was released at <DATE>1230 today</DATE> after a 
two-hour meeting between the two presidents. 
  Presidents <PERSON>Itamar Franco</PERSON> and <PERSON>Rafael Caldera</PERSON> had lunch 
together and President <PERSON>Itamar Franco</PERSON> then had a free afternoon. 
He is scheduled to return to <LOCATION>Brasilia</LOCATION> on 5 <DATE>March</DATE>. [end 
recording] 
  President <PERSON>Itamar Franco</PERSON> confirmed that by converting wages 
into URV's [Real Value Units], they will not lose their value. 
Therefore, he believes that the mechanism proposed by <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> 
for adjusting wages against inflation is unnecessary. 
  Following the release of the joint communique, President 
<PERSON>Itamar Franco</PERSON> held a news conference during which he criticized 
the activities of oligopolies in <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> and expressed hope that 
<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> will improve the provisional measure as far as 
oligopolies are concerned. Concerning wage policies, he asked 
that the negotiations be conducted at the ministries and the 
respective business sectors [camaras setoriais]. 
  President <PERSON>Itamar Franco</PERSON> said the government has nothing to 
hide. Therefore, there is no reason for the workers to strike 
when the authorities are open to dialogue. The president added 
that if the workers demonstrate that the wages are actually 
losing their value, the government will obviously take this fact 
into account. 
  Itmar Franco noted that Finance Minister <PERSON>Fernando Henrique 
Cardoso</PERSON>'s departure from the government, if it occurs, will not 
hurt the management of the economic program that interests the 
entire country, not just the government.

<FÊP=106> [Article by <PERSON>Kristina Michaelles</PERSON>] </F>
  [Text] <LOCATION>Sao Paulo</LOCATION> -- With a single pen stroke <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> may be 
throwing away the equivalent of <MONEY>$18 million</MONEY> which had been 
earmarked for the demarcation of indigenous reservations, and 
wasting three and a half years of difficult negotiations, as the 
funds have already been approved by the <ORGANIZATION>German Government</ORGANIZATION>. 
According to <ORGANIZATION>Environment Ministry</ORGANIZATION> figures for <DATE>February</DATE>, the 
<ORGANIZATION>Brazilian Government</ORGANIZATION> has already spent <MONEY>$84,000</MONEY> on technical 
missions for negotiating this project. 
  The request for the exclusion of the indigenous reservations 
project is contained in a letter sent by the <ORGANIZATION>Foreign Ministry</ORGANIZATION> to 
the German Government on 23 <DATE>February</DATE>. In the letter, the 
<ORGANIZATION>Foreign Ministry</ORGANIZATION> suggests modifications in the memorandum about 
bilateral participation within the framework of the Pilot 
Program for the Preservation of <ORGANIZATION>Brazilian Tropical Forests</ORGANIZATION>, 
which totals <MONEY>68 million German marks</MONEY> (<MONEY>$40 million</MONEY>). The 
Indigenous Reservations Demarcation project had already been 
approved by an interministerial commission to which the <ORGANIZATION>Foreign 
Ministry</ORGANIZATION> also belongs. 
<H5>  Protest </H5>
  The fax sent to the Germans has elicited a strong protest 
from <PERSON>Dinarte Nobre de Medeiros</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Funai</ORGANIZATION> [<ORGANIZATION>National 
Indian Foundation</ORGANIZATION>], who defined the <ORGANIZATION>Foreign Ministry</ORGANIZATION> decision as 
"inappropriate and untimely." In a fax sent on 3 <DATE>March</DATE> to the 
<ORGANIZATION>Environment Ministry</ORGANIZATION>, which is responsible for negotiating the 
overall Pilot Program, <PERSON>Medeiros</PERSON> said: "We would be entirely 
paralyzed as far as the regularization of indigenous territories 
is concerned." 
  The <ORGANIZATION>Brazilian Government</ORGANIZATION>'s refusal to accept money from 
abroad for the demarcation of indigenous lands has taken place 
only a few days before the 20 <DATE>March</DATE> meeting to be held in 
<LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION>. The main donors of funds for the Pilot Program (the 
<ORGANIZATION>World Bank</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Group of Seven</ORGANIZATION> wealthy countries, and the 
<ORGANIZATION>European Union</ORGANIZATION>) will participate in the <LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION> meeting. This 
refusal could irreversibly affect other projects in the program. 
  <PERSON>Roberto Smeraldi</PERSON>, who coordinates <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> region matters for 
the organization Friends of the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, said: "This is a serious 
matter, because the Germans are the main financial backers of 
the Pilot Program for the <LOCATION>Amazon Region</LOCATION>, and this attitude could 
end up damaging <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> in the eyes of the other donors." In his 
opinion the consequences of this attitude regarding the Pilot 
Program could be "unthinkable." 
  The Indigenous Rights Nucleus, Friends of the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, and the 
<ORGANIZATION>Amazon Region Work Group</ORGANIZATION> have already sent a joint letter to 
German and Brazilian authorities warning them about the unusual 
unilateral decision made by the <ORGANIZATION>Foreign Ministry</ORGANIZATION>. 
<H5>  Battle </H5>
  The Foreign Ministry fax reveals that there is a hard battle 
going on inside government between the sector opposing the use 
of foreign resources for the demarcation of Indian lands, in the 
name of national sovereignty, and those who did their best to 
obtain foreign help to compensate for the budget cutbacks 
conducted a few weeks ago, which have practically eliminated the 
resources earmarked for the demarcation of indigenous lands. Of 
the <MONEY>$39 million</MONEY> requested by <ORGANIZATION>Funai</ORGANIZATION>, only <MONEY>$1.8 million</MONEY> (<PERCENT>5 percent</PERCENT> 
of the overall amount requested) was approved by the <ORGANIZATION>Federal 
Government Budget Department</ORGANIZATION>. 
  This is one more chapter preceding the political-juridical 
battle over the constitutional revision process. There are 
already 232 proposals and amendments related to Indians' rights. 
Some of them even seek to prevent the demarcation of indigenous 
lands on the border strip, where nearly 200 reservations are 
located.
