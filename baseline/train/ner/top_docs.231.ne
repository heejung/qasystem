into <NA>
a <NA>
buzz <NA>
of <NA>
shock <NA>
and <NA>
horror. <NA>
But <NA>
not <NA>
even <NA>
his <NA>

crowed <NA>
too <NA>
loudly, <NA>
for <NA>

quite <NA>
comfortable <NA>
when <NA>

under <NA>

That <NA>
is <NA>
the <NA>
point <NA>
of <NA>
this <NA>
controversy: <NA>
it <NA>
is <NA>
not <NA>
what <NA>
it <NA>
reveals <NA>
about <NA>
the <NA>
dubious <NA>
political <NA>
debut <NA>
of <NA>
Francois_Mitterrand <PERSON>
, <NA>
but <NA>
what <NA>
it <NA>
reveals <NA>
about <NA>
the <NA>
feelings <NA>
of <NA>
the <NA>
French <NA>
today <NA>
towards <NA>
that <NA>
inglorious <NA>
chapter <NA>
of <NA>
their <NA>
history. <NA>
They <NA>
still <NA>
have <NA>
difficulty <NA>
facing <NA>
up <NA>

what <NA>
happened <NA>
between <NA>
the <NA>

So <NA>
it <NA>
is <NA>
with <NA>
the <NA>
new <NA>
book <NA>
by <NA>
Pierre_Pean <PERSON>
, <NA>
Une_Jeunesse_Francaise* <ORGANIZATION>
. <NA>
It <NA>
provides <NA>
the <NA>
fullest <NA>
account <NA>
yet <NA>
of <NA>
Mitterrand <LOCATION>
's <NA>
early <NA>
career, <NA>
with <NA>
many <NA>
previously <NA>
unpublished <NA>
details. <NA>
But <NA>
most <NA>
of <NA>
the <NA>
story <NA>
has <NA>
long <NA>
been <NA>
known: <NA>
that <NA>
Mitterrand <PERSON>
came <NA>
from <NA>
a <NA>
conservative, <NA>
bourgeois <NA>
background, <NA>
and <NA>
started <NA>
his <NA>
political <NA>
career <NA>
far <NA>
to <NA>
the <NA>
right <NA>
of <NA>
centre; <NA>
that <NA>
before <NA>
joining <NA>
the <NA>
Resistance <NA>
he <NA>
worked <NA>
for <NA>
the <NA>
Petain <PERSON>
government, <NA>
and <NA>
was <NA>
awarded <NA>
the <NA>
top <NA>
Vichy <NA>
decoration, <NA>
the <NA>
'Francisque'; <NA>
and <NA>
that <NA>
he <NA>
remained <NA>
right <NA>
of <NA>
centre <NA>
after <NA>
the <NA>
war. <NA>
What <NA>
is <NA>
most <NA>
disturbing <NA>
about <NA>
the <NA>
book <NA>
is <NA>
not <NA>
mainly <NA>
what <NA>
it <NA>
reveals <NA>
about <NA>
Mitterrand <PERSON>
then, <NA>
but <NA>
what <NA>
it <NA>
reveals <NA>
about <NA>
Mitterrand <PERSON>
now. <NA>
Pean <NA>
clears <NA>
him <NA>
of <NA>
any <NA>
anti-semitism <NA>
under <NA>
Vichy <PERSON>
; <NA>
but <NA>
it <NA>
is <NA>
dismaying <NA>
that <NA>
today <NA>
Mitterrand <PERSON>
should <NA>
still <NA>
be <NA>
pretending <NA>
that <NA>
he <NA>
did <NA>
not <NA>
then <NA>
know <NA>
about <NA>
Vichy <PERSON>
's <NA>
anti-semitic <NA>
laws, <NA>
even <NA>
though <NA>
they <NA>
led <NA>
to <NA>
the <NA>
deportation <NA>
of <NA>
thousands <NA>
of <NA>
Jews <NA>
to <NA>
German <NA>
extermination <NA>
camps. <NA>
Given <NA>
his <NA>
bourgeois, <NA>
provincial <NA>
background <NA>
in <NA>
the <NA>
unstable <NA>
years <NA>
before <NA>
the <NA>
war, <NA>
it <NA>
is <NA>
not <NA>
surprising <NA>
that <NA>
Mitterrand <PERSON>
should <NA>
have <NA>
flirted <NA>
as <NA>
a <NA>
young <NA>
man <NA>
with <NA>
the <NA>
far <NA>
right; <NA>
but <NA>
the <NA>
fact <NA>
that <NA>
his <NA>
friends <NA>
continued <NA>
to <NA>
include <NA>
people <NA>
from <NA>
the <NA>
far <NA>
right, <NA>
not <NA>
just <NA>
after <NA>
the <NA>
war <NA>
but <NA>
into <NA>
the <NA>
1980s <DATE>
, <NA>
will <NA>
reinforce <NA>
his <NA>
opponents' <NA>
conviction <NA>
that <NA>
Mitterrand <PERSON>
has <NA>
few <NA>
political <NA>
principles. <NA>
Perhaps <NA>
the <NA>
bottom <NA>
line <NA>
is <NA>
that <NA>
the <NA>
president <NA>
refuses <NA>
to <NA>
accept <NA>
France <LOCATION>
's <NA>
historical <NA>
and <NA>
political <NA>
responsibility <NA>
for <NA>
the <NA>
debacle <NA>
of <NA>
1940-44. <NA>
As <NA>
far <NA>
as <NA>
he <NA>
is <NA>
concerned, <NA>
Vichy <PERSON>
was <NA>
a <NA>
different <NA>
regime, <NA>

nothing <NA>

in <NA>

nothing <NA>
to <NA>

with <NA>

as <NA>

an <NA>
accident, <NA>
without <NA>

that <NA>

things <NA>

for <NA>
a <NA>
man <NA>
of <NA>
Francois_Mitterrand <PERSON>
's <NA>
generation <NA>
was <NA>
not <NA>
exceptional. <NA>
But <NA>
Mitterrand <PERSON>
, <NA>
at <NA>
a <NA>
time <NA>
of <NA>
his <NA>
own <NA>
choosing, <NA>
has <NA>
co-operated <NA>
in <NA>
revealing <NA>
the <NA>
truth <NA>
about <NA>
his <NA>
past. <NA>
Admittedly <NA>
the <NA>
French <NA>

did <NA>
wait <NA>
until <NA>
the <NA>
last <NA>

maybe <NA>
his <NA>

come <NA>
clean <NA>

did <NA>

now <NA>
well-known <NA>
book <NA>
by <NA>
Pierre_Pean <PERSON>
, <NA>
Une <NA>

That, <NA>
and <NA>
the <NA>
serious <NA>
worries <NA>
about <NA>
his <NA>
health, <NA>
led <NA>
to <NA>
a <NA>
long <NA>
television <NA>
interview <NA>
on <NA>
Monday <DATE>
. <NA>
There, <NA>
Mitterrand <PERSON>
argued <NA>
that <NA>
he <NA>
had <NA>
not <NA>
done <NA>
much <NA>
that <NA>
was <NA>
wrong. <NA>
He <NA>
had <NA>
befriended <NA>
the <NA>
man <NA>
who <NA>
had <NA>
been <NA>
the <NA>
Nazis <ORGANIZATION>
' <NA>
manager <NA>
of <NA>
the <NA>
Holocaust <NA>
in <NA>
France <LOCATION>
, <NA>
Rene_Bousquet <PERSON>
. <NA>
But <NA>
Bousquet <PERSON>
had <NA>
been <NA>
publicly <NA>
cleared, <NA>
even <NA>
though <NA>
his <NA>
associates <NA>
had <NA>
left <NA>
nobody <NA>
in <NA>
any <NA>
doubt <NA>
as <NA>
to <NA>
his <NA>
central <NA>
role <NA>
in <NA>
the <NA>
matter. <NA>
Liberation <NA>
said <NA>
that <NA>
anyone <NA>
looking <NA>
for <NA>
a <NA>
mea <NA>
culpa <NA>
when <NA>
it <NA>
came <NA>
to <NA>
Bousquet <PERSON>
might <NA>
well <NA>
have <NA>
spared <NA>
themselves <NA>
the <NA>
trouble. <NA>
There <NA>
was <NA>
alarm <NA>
about <NA>
the <NA>
role <NA>
of <NA>
the <NA>
press <NA>
in <NA>
France <LOCATION>
, <NA>
but <NA>
even <NA>
that <NA>
took <NA>
different <NA>
forms. <NA>
Le <NA>
Figaro <PERSON>
said <NA>
the <NA>
press <NA>
had <NA>
turned <NA>
on <NA>
Mitterrand <LOCATION>
as <NA>
it <NA>
had <NA>
turned <NA>
on <NA>
other <NA>
presidents <NA>
at <NA>
the <NA>
end <NA>
of <NA>
their <NA>
reign. <NA>
But, <NA>
as <NA>
is <NA>
usual <NA>
with <NA>
Le_Figaro <PERSON>
, <NA>
the <NA>
reality <NA>
is <NA>
different. <NA>
Most <NA>
facts <NA>
about <NA>
Mitterrand <PERSON>
, <NA>
it <NA>
seems, <NA>
were, <NA>
by <NA>
and <NA>
large, <NA>
in <NA>
or <NA>
near <NA>
the <NA>
public <NA>
domain. <NA>
It <NA>
would <NA>
not <NA>
have <NA>
taken <NA>
much <NA>
to <NA>
show <NA>
he <NA>
was <NA>
on <NA>
the <NA>
fringes <NA>
of <NA>
the <NA>
nastier <NA>
xenophobic <NA>
groups <NA>
in <NA>
the <NA>
1930s <DATE>
and <NA>
that <NA>
he <NA>
dined <NA>
with <NA>
Bousquet <PERSON>
in <NA>
the <NA>
1980s <DATE>
. <NA>
After <NA>
all, <NA>
he <NA>
put <NA>
a <NA>
wreath <NA>
on <NA>
the <NA>
tomb <NA>
of <NA>
the <NA>
Vichy <NA>
leader, <NA>
Marshall_Petain <PERSON>
, <NA>
annually <NA>
until <NA>
public <NA>
opinion <NA>
forced <NA>
a <NA>
change <NA>
a <NA>
few <NA>
years <NA>
ago. <NA>
So <NA>
the <NA>
question <NA>
is, <NA>
why <NA>
was <NA>
it <NA>
that <NA>
the <NA>
truth <NA>
did <NA>
not <NA>
come <NA>
out <NA>
until <NA>
Mitterrand <PERSON>
licensed <NA>
it? <NA>
Only <NA>
Le <NA>

has <NA>
taken <NA>
this <NA>
question <NA>
to <NA>

But <NA>
the <NA>
problem <NA>

Mitterrand <PERSON>

deeper <NA>

that. <NA>
They <NA>
like <NA>

aspects <NA>

But <NA>
what <NA>
the <NA>
president <NA>
has <NA>
told <NA>
Le <NA>
Figaro <NA>
newspaper <NA>
in <NA>
two <NA>
long <NA>
interviews <NA>
this <NA>

and <NA>
Mr_Pierre_Pean <PERSON>
, <NA>
the <NA>
author <NA>

a <NA>
startling <NA>
book <NA>
on <NA>
the <NA>
1936-47 <NA>
period <NA>
of <NA>
his <NA>
youth, <NA>
has <NA>
left <NA>
an <NA>
extraordinary <NA>
ambiguity <NA>
around <NA>
everything, <NA>
including <NA>
his <NA>
health. <NA>
He <NA>
told <NA>
Le <NA>
Figaro <NA>
that <NA>
he <NA>
reckoned <NA>
his <NA>
cancer <NA>
'will <NA>
be <NA>
obliging <NA>
enough <NA>
for <NA>
me <NA>
to <NA>
finish <NA>
my <NA>
term' <NA>
which <NA>
ends <NA>
next <NA>
May <DATE>

but <NA>
also <NA>
said <NA>
he <NA>
was <NA>
conscious <NA>

he <NA>
would <NA>
only <NA>
be <NA>
around <NA>
'for <NA>
a <NA>
few <NA>
months <NA>
or <NA>
years'. <NA>
As <NA>
Mr_Mitterrand <PERSON>
, <NA>
a <NA>
specialist <NA>
in <NA>
ambiguity, <NA>
well <NA>
realises, <NA>
such <NA>
comments <NA>
only <NA>
fuel <NA>
the <NA>
uncertainty <NA>
in <NA>
the <NA>
markets <NA>
and <NA>
the <NA>
French <NA>
political <NA>
world <NA>
about <NA>
an <NA>
early <NA>
election. <NA>
It <NA>
was <NA>
already <NA>
known <NA>
that <NA>
the <NA>
young <NA>
Mitterrand <PERSON>
participated <NA>
in <NA>
some <NA>
right-wing <NA>
movements <NA>
before <NA>
the <NA>
war, <NA>
and <NA>
that <NA>
after <NA>
his <NA>
escape <NA>
from <NA>
a <NA>
German <NA>
prisoner <NA>
camp <NA>
in <NA>
1941 <DATE>
, <NA>
he <NA>
worked <NA>
for <NA>
the <NA>
Vichy <PERSON>
administration <NA>
for <NA>
a <NA>
year <NA>
or <NA>
so <NA>
before <NA>
sliding <NA>
into <NA>
the <NA>
resistance. <NA>
But <NA>
what <NA>
has <NA>
shocked <NA>
many <NA>
French <NA>
is <NA>
the <NA>
disclosure <NA>
of <NA>
Mr_Mitterrand <PERSON>
's <NA>
friendly <NA>
associations <NA>

Mr_Jean-Paul_Martin <PERSON>

Mr_Mitterrand <PERSON>

attended <NA>
Mr_Martin <PERSON>
's <NA>
funeral <NA>
in <NA>
1986 <DATE>

He <NA>
also <NA>
told <NA>
Mr_Pean <PERSON>
that <NA>
he <NA>
considered <NA>
Mr_Bousquet <PERSON>
'sympathetic'; <NA>
yet <NA>
as <NA>

he <NA>
inaugurated <NA>
a <NA>

the <NA>
Jewish <NA>
deportations <NA>
in <NA>
1942 <DATE>

which <NA>
Bousquet <PERSON>
was <NA>
accused. <NA>
In <NA>
the <NA>

Mr_Mitterrand <PERSON>
also <NA>
delves <NA>
into <NA>
his <NA>
more <NA>
recent <NA>
past. <NA>
He <NA>
says, <NA>
for <NA>

that <NA>
his <NA>
1989 <DATE>
call <NA>
for <NA>
a <NA>
Europe-wide <NA>
confederation <NA>
was <NA>
misinterpreted <NA>
as <NA>
a <NA>
bid <NA>
to <NA>
keep <NA>
eastern <NA>
Europe <LOCATION>
out <NA>
of <NA>
the <NA>
European_Union <LOCATION>
, <NA>
and <NA>
that <NA>
his <NA>
1991 <DATE>
resistance <NA>
to <NA>
German <NA>
calls <NA>
to <NA>
recognise <NA>
ex-Yugoslav <NA>

not <NA>
an <NA>

But <NA>
of <NA>
more <NA>
current <NA>
interest <NA>

the <NA>
various <NA>

casts <NA>
