<TEXT>
   The heirs of an American soldier accused of
pilfering medieval art treasures from a German church during World
War II have given the trove to a <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> museum for safekeeping
while their ownership is settled.
   The Quedlinburg treasures will not be displayed publicly at the
<LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> Museum of Art until the ownership is decided by a <ORGANIZATION>U.S.
District Court</ORGANIZATION> judge, museum director <PERSON>Richard R. Brettell</PERSON> said
<DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Brettell</PERSON> said professionals and scholars might be allowed to see
the treasures if the court and both sides in the lawsuit agree. The
public likely will get to see the art once ownership is clear.
   ``Each party was interested in eventually displaying the art for
the people in <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>,'' <PERSON>Brettell</PERSON> said.
   The pieces will be moved from rural <LOCATION>Whitewright</LOCATION>, about 60 miles
north of <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION>, to the downtown museum within a week, he said.
   The Lutheran Stiftskirche-Domgemeinde church of Quedlinburg
claims that <PERSON>Joe T. Meador</PERSON> stole the trove while his <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Army</ORGANIZATION> unit
was guarding a mine shaft where the items had been hidden.
   Attorneys for <PERSON>Jack Meador</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jane Meador Cook</PERSON>, the brother and
sister of the soldier, have been negotiating with the church to
have the treasures kept in a neutral place while they haggle over
ownership.
   Meador, who died in <DATE>1980</DATE>, bequeathed the artwork to his
siblings. The heirs claim to have several, but not all, of the 14
treasures sought by the church. The treasures include a 9th- or
10th-century wood reliquary, a container; a jeweled ivory-and-gold
comb; a Byzantine rock crystal flask; four small reliquaries in the
form of turrets, and a small heart-shaped reliquary.
   Two jeweled medieval manuscripts believed held by the Meadors
for several years were sold recently on the European art market.
   <PERSON>Brettell</PERSON> said he did not know how many objects the museum would
receive. He said they included gold, silver, ivory and crystal
articles from the 8th to 14th centuries.
   ``The Quedlinburg treasury is undoubtedly the most important
Carolingian treasury of the Germanies,'' he said. ``The objects
were made for important kings. They were in a repository which was
among the three or four greatest medieval repositories.''
   The Carolingian period refers to the reign of emperor
<PERSON>Charlemagne</PERSON> and his successors in the 8th through early 10th
centuries.
   Brettel refused to assign a value to the treasures.
   ``Important Carolingian objects have not traded hands on the
open market for the last generation and therefore it's impossible
to give a real and correct evaluation,'' he said.

   German Booty in Texas

   An American soldier's theft of German church treasures at
the end of World War II began to surface this April. The New
York Times reported that a government-funded German
foundation had paid a $3 million "finder's fee" for the
Quedlinburg Gospels, a magnificent illuminated Carolingian
manuscript written in gold. The seller reportedly had
threatened the manuscript would be sold to a Japanese buyer.
John S. Torigian, a Dallas attorney acting for anonymous
clients, had arranged the transfer in Switzerland through
Heribert Tenschert, a Bavarian dealer in rare books and
manuscripts. Reaction to the sale was mixed. While pleased
that the Gospels might return to their home when
reunification takes place, many were incensed at the
extortion and disturbed by the secrecy of the seller's
identity.
   The Gospels and other medieval works of art from the
Quedlinburg cloister's treasury were stored for safety in a
mine shaft outside Quedlinburg in 1945 when American troops
approached. The U.S. Army knew treasures were missing, but by
1949, Quedlinburg was part of the Russian zone and later East
Germany, and the Army dropped its investigation.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Among medievalists, the disappearance of the Quedlinburg
treasures was considered a major war loss. The convent had
especially beautiful things, 10th- and 11th-century gifts
from the Ottonian imperial family. The medieval works from
Quedlinburg now in <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> include a silver reliquary with
enamel plaques and carved ivory panels, a small group of rock
crystal vessels, crucifixes of gold and silver, and a carved
ivory comb.
   Shortly after the sale of the Gospels, <PERSON>Willi Korte</PERSON> of
<LOCATION>Berlin</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Prussian Cultural Heritage</ORGANIZATION> administration traveled
to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and followed a trail to the town of <LOCATION>Whitewright</LOCATION>
in <LOCATION>northeast Texas</LOCATION>, and to its bank, where heirs of Lt. <PERSON>Joe
T. Meador</PERSON>, who served in the unit that occupied Quedlinburg,
had deposited the treasures as collateral for a loan. Meador
apparently stole more than 10 works from the Quedlinburg
treasury. Witnesses who served with <PERSON>Meador</PERSON> have come forward
to tell of the theft from the mine shaft. Meador died of
cancer in <DATE>1980</DATE>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Church of Quedlinburg</ORGANIZATION> has brought suit in <ORGANIZATION>Federal
District Court</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> to recover the items, and the West
German government will foot the legal bill. A restraining
order will keep the treasure safe until its ownership is
determined. Meador's sister and brother are defendants and,
along with <PERSON>Mr. Torigian</PERSON>, subjects of a criminal investigation
seeking to discover whether they knew the objects were stolen
before transporting the manuscript to <LOCATION>Switzerland</LOCATION> for sale.
It later was reported that the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> also is looking into their
possible tax liability, putting additional pressure on <PERSON>Jane
Meador Cook</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jack Meador</PERSON> to settle this deeply
embarrassing situation.
   ---
   In mid-July, <PERSON>Judge Vincent L. Broderick</PERSON> denied the
Metropolitan Museum of Art's motion to dismiss a <DATE>1987</DATE> lawsuit
filed by the <ORGANIZATION>Republic of Turkey</ORGANIZATION> to recover more than 200
ancient silver and gold artifacts that <LOCATION>Turkey</LOCATION> calls the
Lydian Hoard and the Met labels "East Greek." Turkey claims
the objects were plundered from a burial mound in <LOCATION>Ushak</LOCATION> and
smuggled out for sale. Although almost 20 years had passed
since the Met acquired the objects through purchases totaling
more than <MONEY>$1 million</MONEY> and through gifts from the two dealers
who made the sale, the court ruled that the museum could not
use the statute of limitations defense. Turkey's assertion
that the Met was not a good-faith purchaser needed to be
tested, the court ruled, adding that the museum may have been
aware of the artifacts' illicit export and may have
deliberately concealed their acquisition. The ruling cleared
the way to trial.

   <PERSON>Van Gogh</PERSON>'s centenary exhibition in <LOCATION>Amsterdam</LOCATION> just closed
after drawing 1.2 million visitors, who admired, among other
paintings, three van Goghs from the Kroller-Muller Museum
recovered by Dutch police earlier this year. Meanwhile,
however, the <ORGANIZATION>Noord Brabant Museum</ORGANIZATION> in nearby s'Hertogenbosch
suffered the theft of three paintings from the artist's early
years in <LOCATION>Nuenen</LOCATION>. On the <TIME>night</TIME> of <DATE>June 27</DATE>, a window was
broken, the alarm system failed, and in the morning the
museum discovered it was missing works it values between <MONEY>$2.7</MONEY>
and <MONEY>$5.4 million</MONEY>.
   ---
   On <DATE>July 4</DATE>, <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> lost three paintings from three museums.
A small Renoir portrait of a woman, on display near a
staircase in the <LOCATION>Louvre</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Pavilion</LOCATION> des <PERSON>Flores</PERSON>, was cut from
its frame during museum hours. About an hour later, the theft
of <PERSON>Ernest Hebert</PERSON>'s portrait of "Monaluccia" was discovered at
the <PERSON>Musee Hebert</PERSON>, a small museum on the <ORGANIZATION>Left Bank</ORGANIZATION>. It too was
cut from its stretcher without tripping the alarm attached to
the frame. A third picture, a landscape of <DATE>1816</DATE> by <PERSON>Paul Huet</PERSON>,
was discovered missing from the museum of the city of <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>,
the <ORGANIZATION>Musee Carnavalet</ORGANIZATION>.
   Reaction was swift. The next day <PERSON>Jacques Sallois</PERSON>, the
director of the national museums, announced an unusual
decision: Five small museums in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> would close until
further notice. In addition to the <PERSON>Musee Hebert</PERSON>, the <PERSON>Gustave
Moreau</PERSON>, <PERSON>Eugene Delacroix</PERSON>, Ennery, and <PERSON>Jean-Jacques Henner</PERSON>
museums will admit visitors only in pre-arranged groups and
for lectures. These museums were the homes or studios of the
artists, and the security staff in each could only be
described as minimal. Increased security was announced for
three of the capital's most popular tourist attractions, the
<LOCATION>Louvre</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Musee d'Orsay</ORGANIZATION>, and the Palace of <LOCATION>Versailles</LOCATION>.

   Print dealers in the <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> area are relieved that
the Doremus twins, <PERSON>Paul Drake</PERSON> and <PERSON>Kevin</PERSON>, are in police
custody. The brothers allegedly worked together, one
distracting gallery staff while the other took prints, then
rolled or folded them, before the two left the gallery. The
"system" then required a visit to a paper conservator to
repair the damage and to alter the edition numbers. Once
framed, the stolen prints were consigned for auction.
Cooperation among victims, specialists at <ORGANIZATION>Butterfield</ORGANIZATION>'s
auction house and Detective <PERSON>William Martin</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Los Angeles
Police Department</ORGANIZATION>'s Art Theft Detail resulted in the arrests
and several felony counts for the brothers.

   The Quedlinburg Quagmire

   Forty-six years after an American soldier took medieval
treasures from the cave where they were stored, his heirs --
almost $3 million richer as a result of their brother's
misdeed and a German foundation's willingness to pay -- have
agreed to return the precious objects to Germany. The
settlement did not, however, "settle" all the issues in this
momentous repatriation, and the flap should continue on other
levels and in other jurisdictions.
   The parties to the Dallas lawsuit announced earlier this
year that they were settling out of court. "Final wording has
yet to be worked out," said Thomas R. Kline, who represents
the Quedlinburg church and Germany's Cultural Foundation of
the States. After the settlement, the art is expected to be
exhibited for two months at the Dallas Museum of Art before
it makes the return voyage.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The soldier's heirs want the church and the foundation to
tell <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> authorities that they are content with the return
of the objects, an implicit request that the government not
pursue the defendants. Transporting the manuscript to
<LOCATION>Switzerland</LOCATION> for sale may have been a violation of the
National Stolen Property Act, and estate taxes may have been
due on the treasure, but no charges have yet been brought.
Final wording might characterize the exchange of Quedlinburg
treasures for cash as something other than a sale, putting
the money outside the reach of the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION>. A private settlement,
however, would not be binding on <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> government officials.
   Last <DATE>spring</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>Cultural Foundation</ORGANIZATION> of the States agreed
to pay a "finder's fee" of <MONEY>$3 million</MONEY> for Quedlinburg's
<ORGANIZATION>Samuhel Gospels</ORGANIZATION>, a highly important luxury manuscript of the
Carolingian period. The seller represented <PERSON>Jane Cook Meador</PERSON>
and <PERSON>Jack Meador</PERSON>, the brother and sister of the soldier who
died in <DATE>1980</DATE>. The transaction was widely reported and led to
the discovery of more objects from Quedlinburg in a bank
vault in <LOCATION>Whitewright</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Meadors</ORGANIZATION>' hometown. The
priceless works were there as a collateral for a loan. The
Quedlinburg church then sued for their return. The settlement
assures both sides an end to a long legal wrangle of
uncertain outcome. The Germans will get all the Quedlinburg
objects that were in the bank for somewhat less than they had
agreed to pay for the Gospels manuscript alone.
   In agreeing to pay the heirs of a thief, the German
foundation has opened itself to further "offers" from others
who possess <PERSON>Joe T. Meador</PERSON>'s war booty. He gave an unknown
number of objects to friends and casual acquaintances in his
social circle in <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION>. If charges are not brought against
the heirs, what will deter the others from trying to arrange
similarly lucrative exchanges?
   It is hoped that the liturgical objects will return to
Quedlinburg, the medieval cloister to which they were given
by the Ottonian dynasty in the 10th and 11th centuries. When
added to the 20 still in <LOCATION>Quedlinburg</LOCATION>, the 10 objects from
<LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> would almost restore the treasury to its original size.
A suitably secure housing to display the newly famous works
is needed, an expensive proposition for a poor East German
town. The treasure would undoubtedly compensate for these
costs by attracting tourists and scholars to Quedlinburg.
   In a parallel turn of events, a <DATE>March</DATE> settlement for
"undisclosed consideration" allowed a <PERSON>Hans Baldung Grien</PERSON>
drawing, missing since World War II, to be carried back to
the <LOCATION>Netherlands</LOCATION>. It was returned by the estate of <PERSON>Ian
Woodner</PERSON>. A year ago, the <LOCATION>Netherlands</LOCATION> announced that it was
actively seeking the return of works from a collection of old
master drawings formerly belonging to financier <PERSON>Franz
Koenigs</PERSON>, who fell on hard times in the early '30s. The
government published a fully illustrated catalog of the 526
missing works from this superb collection of more than 3,000
drawings, which was purchased for the Museum Boymans in
<LOCATION>Rotterdam</LOCATION> from <LOCATION>Koenigs</LOCATION>'s bankers as they fled from Hitler's
advance.
   The drawings soon caught the eye of Hitler's grand
acquisitor, <PERSON>Hans Posse</PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION>Dresden Picture
Gallery</ORGANIZATION>, who was amassing art for the <ORGANIZATION>Fuhrer</ORGANIZATION>'s proposed
museum in <LOCATION>Linz</LOCATION>. As the military prospects of the Third <PERSON>Reich</PERSON>
dimmed, <PERSON>Hitler</PERSON> shelved his museum plans and stored the art in
a <LOCATION>Saxon</LOCATION> castle. When the Soviets liberated the area,
thousands of works of art were carried to the <LOCATION>U.S.S.R.</LOCATION> The
Koenigs drawings are believed to be there too, but some
surfaced in the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION> in the early <DATE>1980s</DATE>, and the <LOCATION>Netherlands</LOCATION>
realized that a major effort would be timely, given the new
openness in the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>.
   The drawing in question, a "Virgin and Child" by the
16th-century German master, turned up in the prominent <LOCATION>New
York</LOCATION> collection of <PERSON>Ian Woodner</PERSON>. The <LOCATION>Netherlands</LOCATION> approached
<PERSON>Mr. Woodner</PERSON> to ask for its return; rebuffed, it brought suit.
As is common, the trial was delayed by procedural motions,
and, indeed, a time-consuming translation of voluminous Dutch
documents and legal statutes was under way when <PERSON>Mr. Woodner</PERSON>
died. His heirs decided not to continue the fight.
   One of the fascinating issues that might have been
determined in trial is whether the decrees of the Dutch
government in exile, declaring invalid such sales of national
treasures for worthless Reichmarks, would have been
recognized by a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> court.

   An ancient marble <PERSON>Jupiter Capitolinus</PERSON>, just 10 inches
tall, was stolen from the <ORGANIZATION>Daedalus Gallery</ORGANIZATION> on <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION>'s
57th Street last fall. It was recovered, only three blocks
away, in <DATE>March</DATE>. That morning, <PERSON>Judith Nugee</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Christie</ORGANIZATION>'s
expert in antiquities, was in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> reviewing possible
consignments. She was leafing through the <DATE>January</DATE> issue of
<ORGANIZATION>IFAR</ORGANIZATION> reports and recognized the <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> she had just examined
in storage.
   Christie's counsel, <PERSON>Patricia Hambrecht</PERSON>, called <ORGANIZATION>IFAR</ORGANIZATION> with
the news, then telephoned Detective <PERSON>Joseph Keenan</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>New
York Police Department</ORGANIZATION> to come to collect the object. Later
that afternoon, <ORGANIZATION>Daedalus</ORGANIZATION>'s director, <PERSON>Thomas Swope</PERSON>, identified
the sculpture in police offices. Christie's then asked the
would-be consignor to come in to sign a contract, and upon
leaving the auction house, the suspect was met by the police.
After questioning, the police arrested him; the man is said
to be cooperating, and the investigation continues.

A priceless 9th-Century manuscript of the Gospels that disappeared near the end

<P>
The manuscript, called the Samuhel-Evangeliar in German, disappeared in <DATE>April,

discovered an underground cache of artworks. 
</P>
<P>
"The manuscript is now in <LOCATION>Switzerland</LOCATION>," said <PERSON>Erika Lancelle</PERSON>, an official with 
the foundation. It represents "one of the masterpieces of Carolingian (8th- to 
late 9th-Century) book illumination," the foundation said. 
</P>
<P>
Lancelle said there will be a formal ceremony in <LOCATION>Berlin</LOCATION> to mark the

<HEAD>Trail of Art Treasures Reads Like Hollywood Script</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lost treasure. International intrigue. A lone
adventurer.
   The script for a Hollywood movie? Nope, this is a job for <PERSON>Willi
A. Kotre</PERSON>, an investigator who followed a trail of musty documents,
Cold War secrets and just plain luck to discover the lost treasure
of the <ORGANIZATION>Quedlinburg Cathedral</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>East Germany</LOCATION>.
   ``But please, don't call me <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION> Jones,'' the soft-spoken
German said.
   The 36-year-old <PERSON>Kotre</PERSON>, a researcher for the <ORGANIZATION>Prussian Cultural
Heritage Foundation</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Berlin</LOCATION>, in <DATE>May</DATE> pinpointed a local bank as
the place where a dead former <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Army</ORGANIZATION> officer's heirs were
keeping the missing gifts of <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>'s earliest kings.
   Now, the art's original owner, the <ORGANIZATION>Lutheran Church of
Quedlinburg</ORGANIZATION>, is suing the family of former Lt. <PERSON>Joe T. Meador</PERSON> for
return of the treasures. Meador died in <DATE>1980</DATE>, bequeathing the
artwork to his brother, <PERSON>Jack Meador</PERSON>, and sister, <PERSON>Jane Cook</PERSON>.
   Lawyers for the church contend <PERSON>Meador</PERSON> stole the treasures in the
final days of World War II, mailed them to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and kept them
in his hometown of <LOCATION>Whitewright</LOCATION>, about 60 miles north of <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION>.
German officials want to bring the artwork home as a symbol of
German reunification.
   ``It is very difficult to take a historical account and
successfully trace a missing item to an individual,'' <PERSON>Korte</PERSON> said.
``Usually, you need some kind of postwar event _ like someone
trying to sell the art _ and then you have a case.
   ``That's what happened here.''
   An East German who helped in the case, <PERSON>Gunter Wermusch</PERSON>, told <ORGANIZATION>The
Dallas Morning News</ORGANIZATION> in a telephone interview from <LOCATION>Berlin</LOCATION> that Nazi
officials hauled the cathedral's treasures into the cave as Allied
troops approached in early <DATE>1945</DATE>.
   Soon after <PERSON>Korte</PERSON>'s search began, a <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> book dealer offered
one of the missing treasures, a 9th-century illuminated manuscript,
to the researcher's employer.
   Officials said the <MONEY>$9 million</MONEY> offer was rejected in late <DATE>1988</DATE>
because of the price and potential problems from buying art taken
from another country. But it provided a clue that the dealer
apparently worked for a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> resident, they said.
   <PERSON>Korte</PERSON> said he began looking for detailed accounts of <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> units
near <LOCATION>Quedlinburg</LOCATION> in <DATE>April 1945</DATE>. Spending months in the <ORGANIZATION>National
Archives</ORGANIZATION> records tracing <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> operations, he then went to the
<ORGANIZATION>National Personnel Records Center</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>St. Louis</LOCATION>, the military's
service records repository.
   More than 1,000 names of soldiers assigned to the area were
found by <PERSON>Korte</PERSON> in over a week of research. He then turned to East
Germans and medieval art experts for further clues.
   Bavarian manuscript dealer <PERSON>Heribert Tenschert</PERSON> in <DATE>February</DATE> was
offered the illuminated manuscript, which had been in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>
without a buyer for two years, the newspaper said.
   Tenschert said he relayed the offer to the Foundation of the
States, a private German cultural group. The foundation paid <MONEY>$3
million</MONEY> to <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION> attorney <PERSON>John T. Torigian</PERSON> in <DATE>April</DATE> for the
manuscript, said <PERSON>Aoachim Fischer</PERSON>, a foundation director.
   Torigian termed himself a proxy for an unnamed <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> client,
<PERSON>Fischer</PERSON> said.
   Dealers left out of the sale immediately began talking, said
<PERSON>Korte</PERSON>.
   ``Eventually, I learned the name of the bank, and it was short
work once I had that,'' he said.
   In <DATE>May</DATE>, <PERSON>Korte</PERSON> went to the <ORGANIZATION>First National Bank of Whitewright</ORGANIZATION>,
which was holding the artwork for the <PERSON>Meador</PERSON> family. Bank president
<PERSON>John Farley</PERSON> said he talked with <PERSON>Korte</PERSON> but gave him no information
about the treasures.
   Checks of his lists and a call to a <LOCATION>Grayson County</LOCATION> veterans'
group produced <PERSON>Joe Meador</PERSON>'s name, said <PERSON>Korte</PERSON>. The Germans
negotiated in successive weeks with the bank and <PERSON>Torigian</PERSON>, who
represents the <PERSON>Meador</PERSON> family, the foundation said.
   But talks stalled on <DATE>June 16</DATE>, when word surfaced of a second
manuscript in <LOCATION>Switzerland</LOCATION> that was offered for <MONEY>$500,000</MONEY>.
   A <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> judge has barred movement of the artwork.

   After Joe Tom Meador of Whitewright, Texas, died in 1980,
his sister, serving as his executor, filed a state
inheritance-tax return showing an estate of about $120,000 in
stock, real estate and life insurance.
   The amount was too small to require a federal estate-tax
return. However, it failed to take account of Mr. Meador's
secret hoard of religious and art treasures that he stole in
Germany and France at the end of World War II while a first
lieutenant in the U.S. Army artillery. At his death, the
stolen art passed to his heirs.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The <PERSON>Meador</PERSON> cache included medieval manuscripts and
reliquaries from the Quedlinburg, <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>, cathedral. It came
to the attention of the public in <DATE>1990</DATE>, when <PERSON>Mr. Meador</PERSON>'s
heirs sold a ninth-century illustrated manuscript of the four
Gospels to a foundation representing the Quedlinburg church
for a "finder's fee" that some reports say was as much as <MONEY>$3
million</MONEY>.
   Now the <ORGANIZATION>Internal Revenue Service</ORGANIZATION> claims that the stolen
works are subject to federal estate tax. In a private ruling
dated last <DATE>Aug. 30</DATE> that has just come to light, the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> also
declares that:
   -- The value of each item for tax purposes is the price it
would have brought, at the time of <PERSON>Mr. Meador</PERSON>'s death, on the
open market -- including the illicit market of international
traffickers in stolen art.
   -- The estate isn't entitled to reduce its taxable value
by deducting recovery claims made by the Quedlinburg church
and other theft victims against <PERSON>Mr. Meador</PERSON>'s sister and
executor, <PERSON>Jane Meador Cook</PERSON>, of <ORGANIZATION>Mesquite</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, and their
brother <PERSON>Jack</PERSON>, of <LOCATION>Whitewright</LOCATION>. The two siblings inherited the
stolen art. The <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> contends they knew something of its
origins and value.
   Attorneys for the heirs say they would have income-tax
liability for any money received in settling the recovery
claims or disposing of the art objects. But the attorneys
insist that there can be no estate tax on <PERSON>Joe Meador</PERSON>'s
estate, because he never had legal title to the treasures.
   The <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> position is that <PERSON>Joe Meador</PERSON> had the economic
equivalent of ownership of the objects for 35 years and at
his death was able to transfer the same benefits to his
heirs. While the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> found no such precedent in estate-tax
law, it said <PERSON>Joe Meador</PERSON> clearly would be treated as the owner
under income-tax law and, therefore, must be for estate-tax
purposes.
   But, says <PERSON>Randal Mathis</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> lawyer for the heirs,
"We think the ruling is in error, and we're quite confident
that in the long run a court will so determine." <PERSON>Donald Lan
Jr.</PERSON>, a partner of <PERSON>Mr. Mathis</PERSON> in the firm <ORGANIZATION>Strasburger &amp; Price</ORGANIZATION>,
adds: "It's a very big stretch to extend to estate taxes the
principles of income-tax law."
   Lawyers for the <PERSON>Meadors</PERSON> and the church say no overall
valuation has been placed on the collection. The recently
issued public version of the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION>'s private ruling doesn't try
to set a value and doesn't name any of the parties to the
matter. But the facts described clearly relate to the
Quedlinburg-treasures affair, which was widely reported
starting in mid-1990.
   The treasures are being stored for safekeeping at the
<LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> Museum of Art, pending the final settlement of a
tentative agreement to restore them to the church. The <PERSON>Meador</PERSON>
heirs agreed a year ago to give up all of the objects in
return for a sum that hasn't been disclosed. Lawyers for the
family and the church won't discuss the dollar figure but say
it is less than the German foundation originally agreed to
pay for the single manuscript.
   <PERSON>Mr. Mathis</PERSON> says the final agreement has been delayed by
the difficulties of communication and of working within
different legal systems. He says the documentation ending the
church's civil suit against the heirs should be completed
amicably within two weeks, after which the financial terms
would be disclosed.
   <PERSON>Mr. Mathis</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mr. Lan</PERSON> say that they haven't discussed a
settlement with the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> and that they are awaiting a formal
deficiency notice. At that point, the <ORGANIZATION>Meadors</ORGANIZATION> could appeal to
the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Tax Court</ORGANIZATION>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> could add claims for interest or for civil
penalties for such things as negligence or failure to file a
return. If it prevails, it could claim the heirs are liable
for the estate tax.
   The <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> won't discuss confidential matters about specific
taxpayers. But a spokesman for <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> state tax authorities
says: "Our file on the <PERSON>Meador</PERSON> case is open. We've been in
contact with federal authorities about it."

<HEAD>East German Church Determined to Recover Lost Treasures</HEAD>

<DATELINE>QUEDLINBURG, East Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Rev. <PERSON>Friedemann Gosslau</PERSON>
said his heart soared when he heard that medieval artworks
belonging to his church are believed to be in a <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> bank.
   He has complete faith priceless objects that disappeared in <DATE>1945</DATE>
at the end of World War II will be found and restored to his
500-member parish and Quedlinburg's 12th-century cathedral.
   ``We must defend the interests of the church. When the pieces
are here again, we will show them, but this time we'll need help
with security,'' <PERSON>Gosslau</PERSON> said with a smile.
   The treasures, among <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>'s most famous artworks, are the
subjects of an international struggle. The Lutheran church in
<LOCATION>Quedlinburg</LOCATION> has filed suit in <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> to try to recover a collection
that includes a silver, ivory and gold reliquary from the 9th or
<DATE>10th century</DATE>, a 10th-century Byzantine rock-crystal flask with
sides shaped like birds, and an ivory comb inlaid with precious
stones.
   It is believed the works were taken to <LOCATION>Whitewright</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> by the
late <PERSON>Joe T. Meador</PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> lieutenant who served in
Quedlinburg in <DATE>1945</DATE>.
   During the war, the objects were removed from the Romanesque
cathedral to a mine shaft to keep them safe from Allied bombing.
They disappeared in <DATE>1945</DATE>.
   Gosslau came to Quedlinburg 25 years ago and learned about the
missing works by studying cathedral archives.
   ``I thought maybe we'd find traces and then convince the people
to give the pieces back peacefully. I dreamed of it, but I never
counted on it,'' <PERSON>Gosslau</PERSON> said in an interview in his home.
   The Lutheran minister said it was always thought the missing
pieces could have been taken by ordinary Germans during the chaotic
end of the Third <PERSON>Reich</PERSON>; by Nazi SS forces who seized the cathedral
at the start of the war; or by the American soldiers who occupied
the town.
   Then in <DATE>May</DATE> there was news that a private West German foundation
that searches for stolen artworks had recovered a 9th-century
illuminated manuscript of the Four Gospels.
   ``We had no idea where it was. It's fantastic news and it's sure
it comes from the church because it is described in the
inventory,'' <PERSON>Gosslau</PERSON> said.
   A second illuminated manuscript also noted in church archives
was recovered in <DATE>June</DATE>. Full details of how those works were
recovered have not been made public and they have not been returned
to the church.
   A federal judge <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> ordered the <ORGANIZATION>First National Bank of
Whitewright</ORGANIZATION> to open its vault for inventory by the cathedral.
   ``We were proud of what we have, and about what we didn't have
anymore,'' <PERSON>Gosslau</PERSON> said. ``The cathedral treasure is small, but it
is exquisite.''
   He would like any pieces found in <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> to join the rest of the
treasure that is kept in glass cases in the cool stone vault
constructed in the Middle Ages to hold the priceless objects.
   The part of the collection still in Quedlinburg is a dazzling
display that includes a Syrian vase brought back by crusaders, a
4th-century translation of the <LOCATION>Bible</LOCATION>, and a 13th-century
gem-encrusted illimunated manuscript.
   In the <ORGANIZATION>Middle Ages</ORGANIZATION>, the vault guard was a nun trained to watch
over the works, which were used in services that the royal family
attended.
   Tourists taking the cathedral's guided tour are allowed to look
at the treasure vault, a small room with tiny windows at the top of
a staircase on the edge of the nave.
   During a tour this week, the guide did not mention the lost
treasures. Nor were they mentioned in the small guidebook to the
church on sale at the entrance.
   The town had no chance to seek recovery of the lost valuables
once it became part of <LOCATION>East Germany</LOCATION> in <DATE>1949</DATE>. Contact was limited
until the country's former Communist leaders opened the country's
borders last year.
   ``We knew the crates were broken into and some things taken
away. But we didn't know where they went,'' said <PERSON>Walter Gold</PERSON>, the
city's cultural adviser.
   ``Because the world was divided, we had no contact with the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION>
so we couldn't do anything about it.''
   The remains of Heinrich I, <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>'s first king, and his wife
<PERSON>Mathilde</PERSON> are buried inside the cathedral. Heinrich I died in 936.
   While the cathedral is still state property, <PERSON>Gosslau</PERSON> maintains
that according to old laws the treasure belongs to the parish and
should be returned to the vault.

FT  02 DEC 93 / FT Traveller, Zurich (15): Start at 'The Gates of Hell' -

Where is the largest collection outside <LOCATION>Scandinavia</LOCATION> of the work of <ORGANIZATION>Edvard
Munch</ORGANIZATION>? And where is one of the finest private collections of European art?
Where is the only museum in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> entirely devoted to native American
Indians? And where is the only museum showing the influence of coffee on
social and cultural life? Where did the Dada movement begin?
Where can one view a collection of 20th-century art, dominated by the works
of <PERSON>Augusto</PERSON> and <PERSON>Giovanni Giacometti</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Giovanni</ORGANIZATION>'s son, <PERSON>Alberto</PERSON>? Where is one
of the world's finest museums of Asian and African art? And which European
city threatens its graffiti artists with imprisonment?
The answer to all these question is, of course, <LOCATION>Zurich</LOCATION>. The city is blessed
with enough museums, gardens and galleries to keep the most enthusiastic
observer busy for a week or more.
The smaller contemporary art galleries tend to open only in the afternoons,
so it is a good idea to visit the main collections in the mornings.
Why not start your tour at 'The Gates of Hell' by <PERSON>Rodin</PERSON> outside the entrance
to the ultra-modern Kunsthaus in <LOCATION>Heimplatz</LOCATION>? Here, you can acquaint yourself
with the work of the leading Swiss 20th-century painter, <PERSON>Ferdinand Hodler</PERSON>.
There is also an excellent range of paintings, drawings and sculptures of
old masters and <LOCATION>Zurich</LOCATION> artists from the <DATE>15th century</DATE> to the present. It is
here that one can see so much <ORGANIZATION>Edvard Munch</ORGANIZATION> and so much space devoted to the
Giacomettis.
The Kunsthaus is on the circuit for full-dress exhibitions of artists of
international repute and often has smaller studio presentations of
contemporary and local artists.
The <ORGANIZATION>Swiss National Museum</ORGANIZATION> (<ORGANIZATION>Schweizerische Landesmuseum</ORGANIZATION>) is a neo-Gothic
building which looks like an old castle complete with gate tower and wings
built around a central courtyard. It is across the street from the main
railway station and acquired notoriety in the late <DATE>1980s</DATE> when drug addicts
converged in the adjacent <LOCATION>Platzspitz</LOCATION> park. The addicts have since been
shooed away and the park has been restored.
It displays artefacts of Swiss culture from the stone age to present,
including weapons, flags, uniforms, armour, toy armies, costumes, coins,
jewellery, seals, glass painting, religious painting and sculpture, whole
house interiors, watches, musical instruments and farm and industrial tools.
In short, one can discover a well-presented and informative illustrated
history of <LOCATION>Switzerland</LOCATION>.
The <ORGANIZATION>Rietberg Museum</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Gablerstrasse</LOCATION> is housed in the grounds of an
exquisite 19th-century neo-classical mansion, <PERSON>Villa Wesendonck</PERSON>, built for a
German merchant in imitation of the Roman Villa Albani. It long served as a
retreat for musicians and writers. <PERSON>Richard Wagner</PERSON> spent several years here,
and there is a monument to him.
After the <ORGANIZATION>City of Zurich</ORGANIZATION> acquired <PERSON>Baron Eduard Van der Heydt</PERSON>'s famous Asian
and African collections in <DATE>1956</DATE>, this villa became a public museum for
non-European art.
The <ORGANIZATION>Bellerive Museum</ORGANIZATION>, housed in another neo-classical villa in <LOCATION>Hoschgasse</LOCATION>,
is devoted to arts and crafts, including art nouveau textiles, tapestries
and modern furniture. Sadly, the display space is limited, but the care
which is taken in presenting the frequently changing displays make it well
worth a visit. In the <DATE>summer</DATE> the courtyard contains a sculpture exhibition.
Across the street from the Bellerive is the unique <PERSON>Heidi Weber</PERSON> Private
Museum. This was the last building built by Le Corbusier and is the only
modern example of 'total concept art', where architecture, sculpture, and
painting live in supposedly perfect harmony. It is open only from <DATE>June</DATE> to
<DATE>October</DATE>.
The <ORGANIZATION>Buhrle Collection</ORGANIZATION> (Stiftung Sammlung EG <PERSON>Buhrle</PERSON>), built on the fortune of
the great Zurich-based weapon makers, <PERSON>Oerlikon Buhrle</PERSON>, is small, but
contains some of the finest European paintings from several periods. The
impressionist and post-impressionist works are particularly dazzling. Here
one sees <PERSON>Manet</PERSON>'s Swallows, <ORGANIZATION>Renoir</ORGANIZATION>'s Little <PERSON>Irene</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Cezanne</ORGANIZATION>'s Boy in the
<LOCATION>Red Waistcoat</LOCATION>, among other masterpieces. The collection is open only on
<DATE>Tuesday</DATE> and <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>afternoons</TIME> from 2pm to 5pm but alone is worth a trip to
<LOCATION>Zurich</LOCATION>.
If North American Indians are of special interest, the Indianermuseum in
Feldstrasse 89, with some 1,400 items in part of an old schoolhouse, is
worth a visit. On the same theme, try to find the Museum Leuengasse in
Leuengasse 10. This unusual exhibition space - it is an old nuclear bomb
shelter - is devoted exclusively to North and South American Indian and
Eskimo art and culture. It houses not only ancient works but also the
occasional contemporary artists on two levels proceeding ever deeper into
the earth.
In addition to these formal collections, the city's main churches are
repositories of wonderful works of art.
The 12th-century Fraumunster in Munsterhof is best known for the narrow
stained glass windows created by <PERSON>Marc Chagall</PERSON> in the chancel and south
transept and by <PERSON>Augusto Giacometti</PERSON> in the north transept. If you have time,
you can see the remains of the Romanesque cloisters on the south side of the
church, decorated with frescoes by <PERSON>Paul Bodmer</PERSON> representing the legend of
the foundation of the abbey as well as that of Grossmunster and the
<LOCATION>Wasserkirch</LOCATION>.
Across the Munsterbridge the Grossmunster cathedral, with the south tower
crowned by a colossal statue of <LOCATION>Charlemagne</LOCATION>, can be clearly seen. The
Grossmunster also dates from the Carolingian period, and it was here that
<PERSON>Huldrych Zwingli</PERSON> set off the Reformation in <DATE>1519</DATE>.
The bronze doors of the north and south portals are by <ORGANIZATION>Edvard Munch</ORGANIZATION> and
inside are stained glass windows by <PERSON>Augusto Giacometti</PERSON>. The crypt under the
choir is the best example of early Romanesque architecture in <LOCATION>Switzerland</LOCATION>,
and it contains the original statue of <LOCATION>Charlemagne</LOCATION>. The one on the south
tower is a copy.

   DALLAS -- A Texas family that inherited religious and art
treasures in 1980 formally agreed to drop its claim to the
treasures and allow them to be returned to the German
cathedral where they were housed before World War II.
   The settlement, signed by the last of 14 members of Joe
Tom Meador's family, ends an almost two-year-old dispute
between the family and the Lutheran Church of Quedlinburg,
Germany. The works were taken from Quedlinburg in 1945, when
Mr. Meador was stationed there as a first lieutenant in the
U.S. Army artillery.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   <PERSON>Mr. Meador</PERSON> brought the works, including medieval
manuscripts and reliquaries, to <LOCATION>Whitewright</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, where
they remained until <DATE>1990</DATE>, when some heirs agreed to sell an
illustrated manuscript to a German cultural foundation. The
church sued the family in federal court in <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> later that
year. A tentative settlement of the suit was reached in
<DATE>January 1991</DATE>.
   Specific terms of the settlement weren't provided, but
both sides said the <PERSON>Meador</PERSON> family will receive less than the
<MONEY>$3 million</MONEY> that they were to receive for the illustrated
manuscript. The accord also calls for the art and religious
works to be exhibited at the <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> Museum of Art before
returning to <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>.
   The settlement didn't resolve a preliminary ruling by the
<ORGANIZATION>Internal Revenue Service</ORGANIZATION> that the trove should have been
listed as part of <PERSON>Mr. Meador</PERSON>'s estate. "In the event that
ruling becomes final, we fully expect to challenge it in
court," said <PERSON>Randal Mathis</PERSON>, a lawyer for the <PERSON>Meador</PERSON> family.

<HEAD>Meador Confided in Friend About Smuggled Medieval Art</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> soldier accused of smuggling medieval
treasures out of <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> near the end of World War II confided to a
longtime friend that he took the trove, a newspaper reported today.
   For years before his death in <DATE>1980</DATE>, <PERSON>Joe T. Meador</PERSON> was torn over
whether to keep the artwork or return it, <PERSON>Owen Hunsaker</PERSON>, <PERSON>Meador</PERSON>'s
college classmate in the <DATE>1930s</DATE>, told <ORGANIZATION>The Dallas Morning News</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``When he looked at it he'd get a dreary, transported look on
his face because he knew what he had _ he loved it _ and he
couldn't part with it,'' <PERSON>Hunsaker</PERSON> was quoted as saying.
   ``He struggled with that a lot,'' said <PERSON>Hunsaker</PERSON>, a 71-year-old
retired airline executive who lives in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Hunsaker</PERSON> said his friend told him he found the treasures in a
cave in <DATE>1945</DATE> in <LOCATION>Quedlinburg</LOCATION>, now in <LOCATION>East Germany</LOCATION>, and had simply
wrapped them in brown paper and used an <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> post office to ship
them to his home in <LOCATION>Whitewright</LOCATION>, 60 miles north of <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION>.
   Hunsaker is the first person to explain how Meador allegedly
discovered the artwork and moved it. Reports about the case first
surfaced in The <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> Times two weeks ago.
   The treasures included manuscripts, crucifixes and ancient
coins, which church officials said were gifts to the Quedlinburg
Cathedral from <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>'s earliest kings.
   Lawyers for the <ORGANIZATION>Lutheran Church of Quedlinburg</ORGANIZATION> contend that
<PERSON>Meador</PERSON> stole the treasures while serving as an <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> lieutenant
among troops that occupied the area in <DATE>April 1945</DATE>.
   Meador left the cache to his brother and sister, <PERSON>Jack Meador</PERSON> and
<PERSON>Jane Meador Cook</PERSON>. They are disputing the church's claim of
ownership and trying to keep the items, which are worth millions.
   The <PERSON>Meador</PERSON> family is asking the church's permission to display
the treasures at the <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> Museum of Art or the <ORGANIZATION>Kimball Art Museum</ORGANIZATION>
in <LOCATION>Fort Worth</LOCATION> while the lawsuit over ownership is pending, the News
reported today.
   ``We have not as yet spoken with either museum,'' the family's
attorney, <PERSON>Randal Mathis</PERSON>, told the newspaper. ``We think that they
would be appropriate places for safekeeping.''
   <PERSON>Hunsaker</PERSON> was in the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> during World War II while his friend
fought in <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>. He said that during a visit to <LOCATION>Whitewright</LOCATION> in
<DATE>1948</DATE>, <PERSON>Meador</PERSON> showed him artwork that he said he had wrapped in
brown paper, marked as ``old books'' and deposited in a mailbox at
<ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> headquarters.
   He said <PERSON>Meador</PERSON> told him that he found the artwork in <DATE>1945</DATE> in a
cave filled with treasures of gold and silver, and filled his <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION>
jacket with ``as many treasures as he could hold'' before returning
to his headquarters.
   <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Army</ORGANIZATION> reports indicate the treasures were removed from a
mine shaft near <LOCATION>Quedlinburg</LOCATION> within three days after Allied troops
occupied the area in <DATE>April 1945</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Hunsaker</PERSON>, the News reported, said <PERSON>Meador</PERSON> did not tell him
whether anyone helped him remove the artwork or whether he returned
to the cave later to get more items.
   He said they sat for hours paging through a manuscript with an
elaborate cover of gold encrusted with jewels, and highlighted with
a silver figure of Jesus Christ with his hand risen in benediction.
   ``It was unbelievable,'' <PERSON>Hunsaker</PERSON> said. ``I knew I was touching
ancient history.''
   <PERSON>Hunsaker</PERSON> said he frequently tried but failed to persuade <PERSON>Meador</PERSON>
to turn over the artwork to authorities.
   ``Joe knew he had a hot potato,'' said <PERSON>Hunsaker</PERSON>. ``He couldn't
let everybody know about it, and he certainly couldn't sell it.''
   <PERSON>Hunsaker</PERSON> said he last talked to <PERSON>Meador</PERSON> a few years before he
died.

<TEXT>
   People who knew <PERSON>Joe T. Meador</PERSON> say they
can't believe the quiet hardware store owner stole millions in
medieval art from a German church while he was a soldier during
World War II.
   The possibility that <PERSON>Meador</PERSON> stashed the precious cache in a
<LOCATION>Whitewright</LOCATION> bank vault was the talk of this farm town <DATE>Thursday</DATE>,
when The <ORGANIZATION>New York Times</ORGANIZATION> quoted unidentified sources as saying he
was responsible for one of the century's biggest art thefts.
   ``I just don't believe he was that kind of a man,'' said
73-year-old <PERSON>Mary Bryant</PERSON>, who said she had visited <PERSON>Meador</PERSON>'s home but
could not remember seeing any sumptuous works of art.
   ``He didn't seem the type of guy to me that would do something
like that,'' said <PERSON>Troyce Spencer</PERSON>, who also lives in this town of
1,760 people about 60 miles north of <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION>.
   The newspaper said <PERSON>Meador</PERSON>, in the final days of World War II,
took the objects from a church in <LOCATION>Quedlinburg</LOCATION>, an ancient castle
town in what is now <LOCATION>East Germany</LOCATION>. The Times based its report on
interviews with art experts, lawyers and neighbors of <PERSON>Meador</PERSON>.
   Stolen was a small, silver display case inlaid with enamels and
precious stones, with side panels of carved ivory; a liturgical
ivory comb; a manuscript dated <DATE>1513</DATE>; several rock crystal flasks
and gold and silver crucifixes, and other treasures.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> investigated the theft but dropped the matter in <DATE>1949</DATE>
when Quedlinburg became part of <LOCATION>East Germany</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Dietrich Kotzsche</PERSON>, a German authority in medieval decorative
art, said the Quedlinburg treasures, dating to the 9th and 10th
centuries, could be worth millions.
   The Times reported today that the church in <LOCATION>Quedlinburg</LOCATION> has
retained two lawyers to seek the return of the art.
   Meador died in <DATE>1980</DATE> at age 64. He co-owned a family hardware and
farm tool business and grew orchids in a greenhouse behind the
two-story Victorian home he shared with his mother, <PERSON>Mabel</PERSON>.
   ``He was the type of fellow that didn't mix with people much,''
said <PERSON>Odell Caraway</PERSON>, a member of <ORGANIZATION>American Legion Post</ORGANIZATION> 225 to which
<PERSON>Meador</PERSON> once belonged. ``As far as I know he's never been involved
in any kind of crooked stuff.''
   <PERSON>Willi A. Korte</PERSON>, a West German government official who
specializes in the repatriation of cultural property, and <PERSON>Thomas R.
Kline</PERSON> of the law firm <ORGANIZATION>Andrews &amp; Kurth</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION>,
said they planned a trip to <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> today to negotiate with <PERSON>Meador</PERSON>'s
relatives, the <ORGANIZATION>Times</ORGANIZATION> said.
   Neither those lawyers nor <PERSON>John S. Torigian</PERSON>, an attorney for
<PERSON>Meador</PERSON>'s brother, <PERSON>Jack</PERSON>, could be reached for comment <DATE>Thursday</DATE> by
<ORGANIZATION>The Associated Press</ORGANIZATION>.
   Meador was an officer in the <ORGANIZATION>87th Armored Field Artillery</ORGANIZATION>, which
occupied Quedlinburg and guarded a mine shaft where the <ORGANIZATION>Times</ORGANIZATION> said
the treasures were kept. The items disappeared a few days after
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> troops took over the area in <DATE>1945</DATE>, the newspaper said.
   Three longtime <PERSON>Meador</PERSON> employees said <DATE>Thursday</DATE> they had never
known their boss to show off any art works.
   The Times reported that a source it did not identify said the
treasures are in the vault of the <ORGANIZATION>First National Bank of
Whitewright</ORGANIZATION>, reportedly as collateral for a loan. <PERSON>Harrell Stowers</PERSON>,
the bank's executive vice president, would not confirm that
information <DATE>Thursday</DATE> when asked by <ORGANIZATION>The Associated Press</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>Jack Meador</PERSON>, his wife, <PERSON>Jean</PERSON>, and <PERSON>Meador</PERSON>'s sister, <PERSON>Jane Meador
Cook</PERSON>, also would not comment <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   How the treasures got to <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> is a secret that may have died
with <PERSON>Meador</PERSON>.
   Most of the people interviewed <DATE>Thursday</DATE> said they didn't know
<PERSON>Meador</PERSON> had even been in the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> or World War II.
   ``We haven't had this much excitement since the machine gun
deal,'' said Mayor <PERSON>Clarence Tillet Jr.</PERSON>, who explained that a judge
once charged four machine guns in the town's name to avoid paying
sales tax.

   Art treasures allegedly pilfered by an American
soldier at the end of World War II have been given to a <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION>
museum while attorneys for his family and an East German church
haggle over ownership of the treasure.
   Attorneys for the church in Quedlinburg and for the heirs of
former <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> Lt. <PERSON>Joe T. Meador</PERSON>, who allegedly took the centuries-old
objects, announced the agreement today at the <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> Museum of Art.
   The museum agreed to provide a ``temporary, neutral safe
haven,'' said museum director <PERSON>Richard R. Brettell</PERSON> in a statement.
However, the pieces will not be displayed publicly until the
lawsuit brought by the church is settled.
   ``Claimants presently contemplate permitting the museum
subsequently to display the objects ... with terms for any display
to be negotiated later,'' the statement said.
   The objects to be brought to the museum include articles of
gold, silver, ivory and crystal dating from the 8th to 14th
centuries, the museum said.
   The agreement was reached today between law firms representing
both sides.
   The items have been in <LOCATION>Whitewright</LOCATION>, about 60 miles north of
<LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> since <DATE>1945</DATE>, the museum said.
   The artworks have been stored recently in safety deposit boxes
in banks in those cities.
   The Lutheran church, Stiftskirche-Domgemeinde of Quedlinburg,
claims <PERSON>Meador</PERSON>, who lived in <LOCATION>Whitewright</LOCATION>, stole the trove while his
unit was guarding a mine shaft where the items had been hidden.
   Attorneys for <PERSON>Jack Meador</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Whitewright</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Jane Meador Cook</PERSON> of
<ORGANIZATION>Mesquite</ORGANIZATION>, brother and sister of the deceased soldier, have been
negotiating a proposed move of the treasures to the <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> museum.
   The ownership lawsuit is being heard by <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> District <PERSON>Judge
Sidney Fitzwater</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION>, who is expected to review the
agreement. Fitzwater on <DATE>July 9</DATE> ordered the heirs and the church to
agree on a facility to store the items until the case is settled.
   Meador, who died in <DATE>1980</DATE>, bequeathed the artwork to his siblings.

<TEXT>
   An East German church is getting help
from <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION> to retrieve art treasures believed pilfered by an
American soldier at the close of World War II, a West German
official said <DATE>Monday</DATE>.
   East and <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION> also agreed to build an information
database aimed at the return of other art works that vanished when
the Third <PERSON>Reich</PERSON> fell.
   Litigation to retrieve the so-called Quedlinburg treasures from
bank vaults in <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> is already under way. The <ORGANIZATION>Foreign Ministry</ORGANIZATION>
said <DATE>Monday</DATE> that <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION> would pay the legal costs.
   <LOCATION>Bonn</LOCATION>'s help in meeting the expense will be a major boost for the
<ORGANIZATION>Lutheran Church of Quedlinburg</ORGANIZATION>, which claims its treasures were
stolen at the end of World War II, said <PERSON>Klaus Maurice</PERSON>, director of
the <ORGANIZATION>West German Cultural Foundation</ORGANIZATION> of the States.
   ``Nobody knew until now who had to pay, but they will pay and
this is marvelous,'' <PERSON>Maurice</PERSON> said.
   The Quedlinburg treasures include two rare medieval manuscripts,
a jeweled, ivory-carved container for relics and several
rock-crystal and ivory objects. They were allegedly removed from a
mine shaft where they had been hidden in the final days of the war.
   <PERSON>Maurice</PERSON> said there was no doubt the art works in question were
authentic.
   The Quedlinburg treasures, among <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>'s most famous art
works, were allegedly taken by a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> army officer stationed in
<LOCATION>Quedlinburg</LOCATION>, now <LOCATION>East Germany</LOCATION>, in <DATE>1945</DATE>, and brought to his hometown
of <LOCATION>Whitewright</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>.
   The church is suing the sister and brother of the officer, the
late <PERSON>Joe T. Meador</PERSON>, to recover the treasures.
   <PERSON>Maurice</PERSON> said officials have no clear idea of how many other
works were allegedly looted from <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>'s artitistic heritage in
the final months of the war.
   ``The problem up to now is that we had two states and it wasn't
easy to speak with <LOCATION>East Germany</LOCATION>,'' <PERSON>Maurice</PERSON> said. ``Now, this is
easier.''
   Maurice spoke after attending a two-hour meeting to dicuss
coordinated approaches toward retrieving lost German art. Also
attending the meeting was a <ORGANIZATION>Ministry of Culture</ORGANIZATION> representative from
<LOCATION>East Germany</LOCATION>, which is expected to formally unite with its Western
neighbor in <DATE>December</DATE>.
   The new database is to be established in <LOCATION>Berlin</LOCATION> and collect
information from museums, churches and other institutions
throughout the two Germanys, <PERSON>Maurice</PERSON> said. The database will
compare pre-World War II inventories with current records in an
attempt to get a complete picture of what is missing, he said.

FT  15 MAR 93 / Arts: Parisian cathedral of culture - Architecture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I do not often sit down to a candlelit dinner in a French cathedral but last
week I had the opportunity, between mouthfuls of lamb and couscous, to study
the Romanesque sculptures of the cathedral of <ORGANIZATION>St Lazare</ORGANIZATION> at Autun. At the
same time I was able to contemplate the outstanding 12th-century carvings of
the tympanum of the Vision of the Apocalypse at the abbey church of <LOCATION>Moissac</LOCATION>;
and I scarcely had to turn my head to see the remarkable relationship
between architecture and sculpture at the basilica of <ORGANIZATION>St Madeleine</ORGANIZATION> at
<LOCATION>Vezelay</LOCATION>. Within reach of my table were the slender sculptures from <LOCATION>Chartres</LOCATION>
as well as columns, capitals, chancels and Carolingian conceits from all
over <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>.
I was, of course, in a cathedral of culture, at an elegant Parisian event to
mark the re-opening of the <ORGANIZATION>Musee National des Monuments Francais</ORGANIZATION> at the
<ORGANIZATION>Palais de Chaillot</ORGANIZATION>. The story of this museum goes back to the <DATE>1880s</DATE> when the
architect Eugene-Emanuel Viollet-le-Duc (1814-1879) had the idea that the
French public should have the chance to see, in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>, the high points of
French architecture and sculpture of the Middle Ages. He put together this
remarkable assembly of cast copies of important elements of buildings in
what was then the new Palais du <ORGANIZATION>Trocadero</ORGANIZATION>, which had originally been
designed by the architect <PERSON>Davioud</PERSON> for the <ORGANIZATION>Paris Universal Exhibition</ORGANIZATION> in
<DATE>1878</DATE>.
The display was always intended to be didactic, offering the visitor the
opportunity to make comparative analyses of stylistic developments.
Viollet-le-Duc was a scholar and historian and his architectural activity
consisted principally of repair and restoration, including work on monuments
including <LOCATION>Notre Dame</LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Sainte Chapelle</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>. He wrote a dictionary
of French architecture and this museum is an effective monument to his
conviction that architects can and should learn from the past. He saw the
parallels between Gothic structures and the development of 19th-century
engineering.
As the original progenitor of the museum, <PERSON>Viollet-le-Duc</PERSON> would have approved
of the way it has suddenly taken on a new lease of life. The original
<ORGANIZATION>Trocadero</ORGANIZATION> was transformed in <DATE>1937</DATE> by the architect <PERSON>Carlu</PERSON> into the <LOCATION>Palais de
Chaillot</LOCATION>, as the centrepiece of the <ORGANIZATION>Paris Universal Exposition</ORGANIZATION> of that year.
Today these former exhibition buildings gather around the steps and stylish
fountains of the Trocadero, paying homage to the <ORGANIZATION>Eiffel Tower</ORGANIZATION>. They remain
resolutely of the <DATE>1930s</DATE> and provide an extraordinary contrast to the
architectural collections housed there.
For a long time the casts have been seen as little more than dusty relics,
stranded in the <DATE>1930s</DATE> splendour of the Chaillot. It has taken the dramatic
energy of <PERSON>Mr Jack Lang</PERSON> and his ministry of education and culture to see the
potential of this important museum. It has also taken an enormous amount of
work and inspiration from the young curator  - <PERSON>Mr Guy Cogeval</PERSON>, who came here
from the <LOCATION>Louvre</LOCATION>; in only six months he has achieved a considerable
transformation.
It begins in the new entrance hall which has been designed by a young
architect, <PERSON>Jean-Christophe Denise</PERSON>. This is a handsome light space in the
spirit of Carlu. It has a most stylish cafe-restaurant with a marvellous
view of the fountains of the Trocadero and the <ORGANIZATION>Eiffel Tower</ORGANIZATION> (the furniture
is based on <ORGANIZATION>Carlu</ORGANIZATION>'s original art deco designs); there is also a new
bookshop. The clean lines of this hall provide a cool setting for the four
giant fragments of the reproduction of the sculpture - 'la danse de
Carpeaux' - originally created by <PERSON>Paul Landowski</PERSON> in <DATE>1931</DATE>. These look
dramatic and surreal, mounted at a high level on large plinths.
The hall is accessible to all visitors to the museums in the <LOCATION>Palais de
Chaillot</LOCATION>, including those of the theatre and cinema. (The <ORGANIZATION>Musee du Cinema</ORGANIZATION> is
likely to enjoy a close relationship with the renovated <ORGANIZATION>Musee</ORGANIZATION> national des
Monuments Francais because of <PERSON>Mr Cogeval</PERSON>'s great interest in film and his
plans to create events that explore both the plastic and the cinematic
arts.)
To visit the great halls upstairs that house the maquettes, casts and models
is a thrilling experience, although in time the displays will probably be
reordered and captioned to make them both more instructive and more
enjoyable. <PERSON>Mr Cogeval</PERSON> is anxious to make more of the amazing collections of
topographical and architectural photographs stored here. They will form part
of the large programme of temporary exhibitions.
The first exhibition to be held is called '<LOCATION>Marseille</LOCATION> a <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>', a version of
the very successful exhibition held in <LOCATION>Marseilles</LOCATION>. Its subject is the city
in the <DATE>19th century</DATE>, considering both the physical character of the changing
city and the artistic activity within it at the time. A large variety of
artefacts ranging from contemporary models and maps to paintings and plans,
drawings and sculptures is displayed to convey the commerce and creativity
of one entire city at a peak moment of its growth. (The installation here is
sometimes inevitably in conflict with the permanent installation of the
museum, but in <DATE>1994</DATE> there will be a full-scale temporary exhibition space.)
Marseilles grew and prospered in the <DATE>19th century</DATE>, its artistic flowering as
aesthetically mixed as any other city at the time. It is probably right to
show the whole range so that comparisons of quality can be made. Relatively
unknown history painters are shown as seriously as old masters, and posters
and plans rub shoulders with fine drawings. It is a complex and dense
exhibition, giving a sense of a city touched by the exoticism of its African
trade and yet solidly rooted in the <ORGANIZATION>Second Empire</ORGANIZATION> in its architecture and
monuments.
The renewal of this museum in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> is important for the broadening of our
architectural culture. It will take a lot of imagination to build on the
solid foundations of the unique collection. The resurrection has just begun,
but I am sure <PERSON>Mr Cogeval</PERSON> will ensure that it continues with both scholarship
and excitement. It is a museum to watch.

<HEAD>Friend: World War II Officer Confided About Smuggled Medieval Art</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The late World War II <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> officer accused of
stealing priceless German art treasures at the end of the war
stumbled onto them during a battle and simply shipped them home in
a plain brown wrapper, a friend says.
   <PERSON>Owen Hunsaker</PERSON>, a college classmate of <PERSON>Joe T. Meador</PERSON>, said his
friend agonized over whether to return the stolen Medieval
artworks, but loved them too much to part with them, <ORGANIZATION>The Dallas
Morning News</ORGANIZATION> reported <DATE>Friday</DATE>.
   He said <PERSON>Meador</PERSON> was running for cover during fighting near
<LOCATION>Quedlinburg</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> when he ended up in a mine shaft and
discovered an ``Aladdin's Cave.''
   The <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> lieutenant filled his jacket with ``as many treasures
as he could hold,'' <PERSON>Hunsaker</PERSON> said. He then mailed the artworks home
in a box wrapped in plain brown paper and marked ``old books.''
   <PERSON>Hunsaker</PERSON>, 71, of <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> said <PERSON>Meador</PERSON> told him the story during
a visit in <DATE>1948</DATE>. They had been college classmates in the <DATE>1930s</DATE> and
kept in touch until a few years before <PERSON>Meador</PERSON>'s death in <DATE>1980</DATE>.
   The religious treasures stored in the mine shaft for safekeeping
from retreating Nazi forces disappeared in <DATE>April 1945</DATE>. They
belonged to <ORGANIZATION>Quedlinburg Cathedral</ORGANIZATION>.
   Lawyers for the Quedlinburg church contend <PERSON>Meador</PERSON> stole the
treasures and kept them in his hometown of <LOCATION>Whitewright</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, a
tiny town about 60 miles north of <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION>.
   The church wants the treasures returned and has asked a federal
judge to prevent <PERSON>Meador</PERSON>'s heirs from moving or disposing of the
artworks, believed to be stored in nearby bank vaults.
   <PERSON>Hunsaker</PERSON>'s account is the first offering an explanation of how
<PERSON>Meador</PERSON> allegedly discovered and shipped the artworks that include a
bejeweled gold-covered manuscript, crucifixes and ancient coins.
   The artworks were gifts to the church from <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>'s earliest
kings.
   During <PERSON>Hunsaker</PERSON>'s <DATE>1948</DATE> visit to <LOCATION>Whitewright</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Meador</PERSON> took the
so-called illuminated manuscript ``wrapped in an old <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> quilt''
from a bedroom closet, he said.
   ``It was unbelievable,'' said <PERSON>Hunsaker</PERSON>. ``I knew I was touching
ancient history.''
   He said it had an elaborate cover of gold encrusted with jewels,
highlighted with a silver figure of Christ with his hand risen in
blessing.
   <PERSON>Hunsaker</PERSON> said he frequently urged <PERSON>Meador</PERSON> to turn over the
artwork to authorities.
   ``When he looked at it he'd get a dreary, transported look on
his face because he knew what he had _ he loved it _ and he
couldn't part with it. He struggled with that a lot,'' <PERSON>Hunsaker</PERSON>
said.
   Meador considered taking the artworks to <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> to obtain phony
ownership papers, but abandoned the plan because he feared border
police, he said.
   ``Joe knew he had a hot potato,'' <PERSON>Hunsaker</PERSON> said, ``He couldn't
let everybody know about it, and he certainly couldn't sell it.''

<TEXT>
   Word that a local hardware and farm
tool vendor may have pulled off one of the century's biggest art
thefts while a soldier in <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> during World War II was the talk
of this town of 1,760 <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   There were more reporters than residents on the town's main
drag, about 60 miles north of <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION>.
   ``Not much happens here,'' said <PERSON>Carolyn Flaughter</PERSON>, ``You see
cameramen walking up and down the street. You just don't see that
every day.''
   According to a <ORGANIZATION>New York Times</ORGANIZATION> report <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, <PERSON>Joe T. Meador</PERSON>
transported the priceless pieces to <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> from Quedlinburg, an
ancient castle town in what is now <LOCATION>East Germany</LOCATION>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> investigated the theft but dropped the matter in <DATE>1949</DATE>
when Quedlinburg became part of <LOCATION>East Germany</LOCATION>.
   The newspaper quoted an unidentified source as saying the
treasures are in the vault of the <ORGANIZATION>First National Bank of
Whitewright</ORGANIZATION>, reportedly as collateral for a loan.
   Bank officials declined to comment on the reports. <PERSON>Harrell
Stowers</PERSON>, bank executive vice president, said he could not confirm
whether the treasures are or ever have been in the vault.
   Meador died in <DATE>1980</DATE>. His brother, <PERSON>Jack</PERSON>, and his sister-in-law,
<PERSON>Jean</PERSON>, declined to comment <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   The Times based its report on interviews with art experts,
lawyers and neighbors of <PERSON>Meador</PERSON>.
   The treasures include a small silver reliquary, inlaid with
enamels and precious stones, with side panels of carved ivory; a
liturgical ivory comb; a manuscript dated <DATE>1513</DATE>; several rock
crystal flasks and gold and silver crucifixes. Some of the
treasures were gifts from kings and emperors who ruled German
states in the 9th and 10th centuries.
   Meador was an officer with the <ORGANIZATION>87th Armored Field Artillery</ORGANIZATION>, the
unit that occupied Quedlinburg and guarded the mine shaft where the
treasures reportedly were kept. They disappeared a few days after
American troops took over the area in <DATE>1945</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>Times</ORGANIZATION> said.
   Three years after <PERSON>Meador</PERSON> died, his brother-in-law, <PERSON>Dr. Don H.
Cook</PERSON>, of <ORGANIZATION>Mesquite</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, sought to have two medieval manuscripts
evaluated, <PERSON>John Carroll Collins</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> estate appraiser, told
the newspaper.
   A former employee of <PERSON>Meador</PERSON>'s, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said <PERSON>Meador</PERSON> reportedly showed his employees richly bound
gold and silver manuscripts.
   But three longtime <PERSON>Meador</PERSON> employees said <DATE>Thursday</DATE> they'd never
known their boss to show off any art works when they were around.
The three declined to give their names.
   Most of the people interviewed <DATE>Thursday</DATE> said they didn't know
<PERSON>Meador</PERSON> had even been in the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> or World War II.
   ``<PERSON>Joe</PERSON> was a quiet man. I think <PERSON>Joe</PERSON>, in my way of thinking, was a
very, very intelligent man ... he seemed to mind his own
business,'' Mayor <PERSON>Clarence Tillett</PERSON> said.
   <PERSON>Tillett</PERSON> said he'd visited <PERSON>Meador</PERSON> in the house he shared with his
mother but didn't recall any unusual works of art.
   ``It wouldn't have surprised me for anything to come out of
<LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>,'' <PERSON>Tillett</PERSON> said.
   Many residents recalled <PERSON>Meador</PERSON> as a loner whose most memorable
trait was his passion for growing orchids.
   ``He didn't seem like the type of guy to me who would do
something like that,'' said <PERSON>Troyce Spencer</PERSON>, a resident.

In the tiny <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> town of <LOCATION>Whitewright</LOCATION>, hard on the <LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION> border, a scandal 
is brewing in which a man who raised prize orchids and ran a hardware store 
before his death 10 years ago may have been the perpetrator of one of the 
largest art thefts ever recorded. 
</P>
<P>
His name was <PERSON>Joe T. Meador</PERSON>, by all accounts a quiet, unassuming man who served 
honorably in World War II and ended his service stationed in what is now <LOCATION>East 
Germany</LOCATION> in <DATE>1945</DATE>. His unit was in charge of guarding a mine shaft that contained 
some of the world's most valuable art objects, hidden there at the time for 
safekeeping. 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>Federal Bureau of Investigation</ORGANIZATION> and a West German investigator are now 
looking to a bank vault in <PERSON>Meador</PERSON>'s hometown of <LOCATION>Whitewright</LOCATION>, population 1,800, 
as the place where the treasures might at last be recovered. The investigation 
was disclosed <DATE>Thursday</DATE> by the <ORGANIZATION>New York Times</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"I am going to <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> to try to put some more nails in some coffins," said <PERSON>Willi 
Korte</PERSON>, the German investigator, in a telephone interview. "I have been to 
<LOCATION>Whitewright</LOCATION> before, and it wasn't because Triple-A recommended it." 
</P>
<P>
The first break in the case occurred <DATE>last April</DATE>, when, for a <MONEY>$3-million</MONEY> 
"finder's fee," one of the missing works was returned to a West German 
foundation, with the stipulation that the names of the sellers, as well as the 
name of the lawyer who negotiated the deal, would never be disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
At the time the deal was cut for the artwork -- a 9th-Century jewel-encrusted, 
illustrated manuscript of the Four Gospels -- a spokesman for the foundation 
said the manuscript was taken to <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> by an American GI at the end of the war. 
That and other treasures were hidden in the mine shaft near <LOCATION>Quedlinburg</LOCATION>, a 
medieval castle town in <LOCATION>Saxony-Anhault Province</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The arrangement for the manuscript was carried out in <LOCATION>Switzerland</LOCATION>, where such 
sales are protected by law. 
</P>
<P>
The lengthy report in the <ORGANIZATION>New York Times</ORGANIZATION> pointed to <PERSON>Meador</PERSON> as the thief and his 
heirs as the people who arranged for the sale of the manuscript. Numerous calls 
to the relatives elicited a string of "no comments." The lawyer named as the 
intermediary in the transaction, <PERSON>John S. Torigian</PERSON>, left word that he would be 
taking depositions for the rest of the week. 
</P>
<P>
The president of the bank where the remainder of the treasures are purportedly 
being kept would not discuss the matter. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON>Mike Satimauro</PERSON> of the <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> office said the matter is under 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"We're intent on getting a better handle on what's supposed to be missing," he 
said. "We're trying to see if we do, in fact, have stolen articles and, if we 
do, we will do our best to get them back." 
</P>
<P>
While the <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> is investigating, the town of <LOCATION>Whitewright</LOCATION> went into an absolute 
swoon <DATE>Thursday</DATE>. Television crews in helicopters flashed overhead and the 
telephones never seemed to stop ringing. 
</P>
<P>
"This has thrown us into an uproar," said Mayor <PERSON>Clarence Tillett</PERSON>. "The whole 
town will be talking about this for some time to come. There's 1,800 people 
here and people usually know what's going on with everyone else in town. But I 
can tell you, all of us were surprised about this news about <PERSON>Joe Meador</PERSON>." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Larry Kennealy</PERSON>, the chief of police, said: "Nobody knows anything about this." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Korte</PERSON>, the investigator, said these kinds of thefts usually follow a similar 
pattern, in which art was taken, the thief dies and the heirs try to cash in on 
the treasure. In this case, the family members allegedly consulted with a 
number of experts about two manuscripts. Most of the experts told the family 
that the manuscripts probably were stolen. 
</P>
<P>
"There was not a whole lot of sophistication, or they wouldn't have exposed 
themselves by having so many appraisals," <PERSON>Korte</PERSON> said. "I hope the family has 
some valuable information and some additional items." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Korte</PERSON> said his first nibble came early this year, when word went out through 
the art world that one of the manuscripts could be had for the <MONEY>$3-million</MONEY> 
finder's fee. That was two years after the first word that the Quedlinburg 
treasures might be for sale, for the right price. 
</P>
<P>
"The offer clearly smelled like it was coming out of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although <PERSON>Korte</PERSON> was somewhat circumspect about how the field was narrowed to 
<LOCATION>Whitewright</LOCATION>, he said documents at the <ORGANIZATION>National Archives</ORGANIZATION> had been extremely 
beneficial. He said he had been looking for an officer to be the thief. Meador 
was a lieutenant when the war ended. 
</P>
<P>
He said experience had shown that most such postwar thefts were "under the eyes 
of an American officer or with the participation of an American officer." 
</P>
<P>
After the war, <PERSON>Meador</PERSON>, who had studied art in college, came back to <LOCATION>Whitewright</LOCATION> 
after his father became ill. By all accounts, he led a very normal life, 
waiting on people at the hardware store and raising orchids in the three 
greenhouses behind the family home. He never married. At graduation time, 
<PERSON>Meador</PERSON> provided free orchids to the seniors. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Marshall Hasty</PERSON>, one of the pallbearers at <PERSON>Meador</PERSON>'s funeral, said <DATE>Thursday</DATE>: "I 
heard from several people that <PERSON>Joe</PERSON> used to bring those manuscripts in the 
hardware store once in a while and left them laying right out there on the 
counter. 
</P>
<P>
"The consensus in town is he didn't know the value of them. If he did, I don't 
think he would have laid them out on a counter in a hardware store downtown." 
</P>
<P>

   A federal judge has ordered an inventory of
medieval artwork believed stolen by a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> soldier from a German
mineshaft during World War II and stashed in a small-town bank
vault in <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>.
   <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> District <PERSON>Judge Sidney A. Fitzwater</PERSON> ordered <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> that the
time and place of the inspection be kept secret to protect the
inspectors and the objects, which have been valued in the millions
by German art experts.
   The Lutheran cathedral in <LOCATION>Quedlinburg</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>East Germany</LOCATION>, is suing to
recover the artwork from the <ORGANIZATION>First National Bank</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Whitewright</LOCATION> and
the family of <PERSON>Joe T. Meador</PERSON>.
   Meador, a former <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> lieutenant, is believed to have stolen the
objects and stashed them in his hometown of <LOCATION>Whitewright</LOCATION>, about 60
miles north of <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION>.
   The treasure disappeared in <DATE>1945</DATE> from a mine shaft in
<LOCATION>Quedlinburg</LOCATION>, a castle town occupied by <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> troops at the end of
World War II. Meador died of cancer in <DATE>1980</DATE>, and his family put the
objects in the bank for safekeeping, said branch President <PERSON>John
Farley</PERSON>.
   <PERSON>Farley</PERSON> said he never knew the art had been stolen and had been
trying to mediate the dispute over its ownership. ``We wanted to do
what was right,'' he said.
   Government officials have said it is unclear whether charges can
be brought in the case because of statutes of limitations on thefts
of art.
   The judge on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> dictated the circumstances of the inventory
down to the type of flash to be used in photographing the items,
the placement of the cameras and a requirement that all inspectors
wear cotton gloves.
   The lawsuit alleges at least 14 objects were taken by <PERSON>Meador</PERSON>,
including a silver, ivory and gold reliquary from the 9th or <DATE>10th
century</DATE>, a 10th century Byzantine rock-crystal flask and an ivory
comb inlaid with precious stones.
   Also listed as stolen are two manuscripts, one from about <DATE>1300</DATE>
and the other from <DATE>1515</DATE>, bound in precious metals and encrusted
with gems.
   Meador's brother and sister, <PERSON>Jack Meador</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Whitewright</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Jane
Meador Cook</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Mesquite</ORGANIZATION>, have refused to comment.
   <PERSON>Farley</PERSON> said the bank will ask to be dropped from the lawsuit
because <ORGANIZATION>First National</ORGANIZATION> never claimed to own the relics.

   A 477-year-old manuscript taken from <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> by an

   The law firm <ORGANIZATION>Andrews &amp; Kurth</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> the Evangelister
manuscript, noted for its silver cover containing the figure of

   This is the second piece of Quedlinburg treasure recovered by

<HEAD>Attorneys for German Church Say Family Is Hiding Treasures</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorneys for an East German church trying to
recover medieval treasures stolen during World War II allege that a
<LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> family moved or hid some of the items in the last two weeks.
   In court documents, the attorneys accuse relatives of <PERSON>Joe T.
Meador</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Whitewright</LOCATION> of moving the articles from bank vaults in
<LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Whitewright</LOCATION> so the lawyers wouldn't find them.
   Meador, who died in <DATE>1980</DATE>, allegedly stole the items, including
centuries-old manuscripts of the Gospels, from the church in
Quedlinburg at the end of World War II.
   Motions filed in federal court <DATE>Friday</DATE> allege that <PERSON>Meador</PERSON>'s
siblings, <PERSON>Jack Meador</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jane Meador Cook</PERSON>, ``have been linked to
more than half'' of about 18 artworks taken from a mine-shaft
hiding place near Quedlinburg in <DATE>1945</DATE>.
   The Meadors allegedly inherited the trove, valued in the
millions, when their brother died of cancer.
   <PERSON>Raymond A. Krell</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION> attorney for the <PERSON>Meadors</PERSON>, did not
return phone calls <DATE>Saturday</DATE> from <ORGANIZATION>The Associated Press</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>Alan Harris</PERSON>, an attorney for the church, declined to comment on
the motions <DATE>Saturday</DATE>.
   No court action was taken <DATE>Friday</DATE> on the motions.
   The church filed a lawsuit <DATE>Monday</DATE> after three weeks of
negotiations with the family reached an impasse.
   The lawsuit, which also names the <ORGANIZATION>First National Bank of
Whitewright</ORGANIZATION> as a defendant, seeks unspecified damages. The bank has
held some of the artwork for at least the last three months, its
lawyer said.
   A <ORGANIZATION>U.S. State Department</ORGANIZATION> legal adviser said this week that the
lawsuit was filed after East German officials learned the treasures
were about to be moved to <LOCATION>Switzerland</LOCATION>, where secrecy laws would
make them impossible to trace or recover.
   <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> District <PERSON>Judge Sidney A. Fitzwater</PERSON> granted a 10-day
temporary restraining order <DATE>Monday</DATE> barring movement of the trove,
pending a decision in the case. But he denied a plea by church
lawyers that the items be placed in court custody for safekeeping.
   On <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, he ordered the church be allowed to examine,
photograph and inventory treasures being stored in vaults at the
<LOCATION>Whitewright</LOCATION> bank and the <ORGANIZATION>First Interstate Bank of Dallas</ORGANIZATION>.
   During an examination <DATE>Thursday</DATE> of <PERSON>Mrs. Cook</PERSON>'s safe-deposit boxes
in <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION>, only one item believed to be a Quedlinburg treasure was
found, the church contends.
   <PERSON>Mrs. Cook</PERSON> removed several of the other items last week, the
church says, and an unidentified person rented a new safe-deposit
box and ``placed certain items'' into it. The objects were not
identified.

   A federal judge on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> ordered the small-town
bank that has been holding a cache of stolen medieval art to open
its vault for inventory by the East German cathedral that claims
the treasure.
   <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> District <PERSON>Judge Sidney A. Fitzwater</PERSON> also ordered that the
time and place of the inspection be kept secret to protect the
inspectors and the objects.
   The art is believed to have been stolen from a German mine shaft
at the end of World War II by a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> soldier from <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>. German art
experts have said the treasures are worth <MONEY>millions of dollars</MONEY>, but
no specific estimate is available.
   The president of a <ORGANIZATION>First National Bank</ORGANIZATION> branch in the town of
<LOCATION>Whitewright</LOCATION> said he never knew the art had been stolen and has been
trying to mediate the dispute over its ownership.
   ``We wanted to do what was right,'' branch President <PERSON>John Farley</PERSON>
said in an interview published <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> in <ORGANIZATION>The Denison Herald</ORGANIZATION>.
   The Lutheran cathedral in <LOCATION>Quedlinburg</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>East Germany</LOCATION>, is suing to
recover the artwork from <ORGANIZATION>First National</ORGANIZATION> and the family of <PERSON>Joe T.
Meador</PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> first lieutenant who is believed to have
stolen the objects and stashed them in his hometown of <LOCATION>Whitewright</LOCATION>,
about 60 miles north of <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION>.
   The treasure disappeared in <DATE>1945</DATE> from a mine shaft in
<LOCATION>Quedlinburg</LOCATION>, a castle town occupied by <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> troops at the end of
World War II.
   Meador died of cancer in <DATE>1980</DATE>, and his family put the objects in
the bank for safekeeping, <PERSON>Farley</PERSON> said. He oversees the <LOCATION>Whitewright</LOCATION>
branch but is based at <LOCATION>Denison</LOCATION>, about 70 miles north of <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION>.
   Farley told <ORGANIZATION>The Associated Press</ORGANIZATION> the bank will ask to be dropped
from the lawsuit because <ORGANIZATION>First National</ORGANIZATION> never claimed to own the
relics. He declined to answer further questions about the case.
   A church representative met with <PERSON>Farley</PERSON> on <DATE>May 7</DATE> to demand
return of the treasures. The lawsuit alleges at least 14 objects
were taken by <PERSON>Meador</PERSON>, including a silver, ivory and gold reliquary
from the 9th or <DATE>10th century</DATE>, a 10th century Byzantine rock-crystal
flask with sides shaped like birds and an ivory comb inlaid with
precious stones.
   <PERSON>Farley</PERSON> and his attorney, <PERSON>Timothy Powers</PERSON>, told <ORGANIZATION>The Denison Herald</ORGANIZATION>
the bank had been negotiating with the church and the <PERSON>Meador</PERSON> family.
   The talks broke down last week when the story broke and
international attention focused on the bank and <LOCATION>Whitewright</LOCATION>,
population 1,760, <PERSON>Farley</PERSON> said.
   He said keeping the treasures did not affect the bank's daily
business or financial status.
   ``We're on the sidelines,'' he said. ``I'm sorry that we were
not able to get the parties to agree. It's not in anyone's best
interest to incur litigation costs.''
   Fitzwater revised his inventory order <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> after conference
calls with attorneys on both sides of the dispute.
   He also ruled on a defense request that had been informally made
<DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, but his office declined to reveal the nature of the
decision or the request until the request is formally filed with
the court <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
   Fitzwater dictated the circumstances of the inventory down to
the placement of cameras and a requirement that all inspectors wear
cotton gloves.
   Attorneys for the defendants did not return phone calls seeking
comment.
   Meador's brother and sister, <PERSON>Jack Meador</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Whitewright</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Jane
Meador Cook</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Mesquite</ORGANIZATION>, have declined to comment.
   Government officials have said it is unclear whether criminal
charges could be brought in the case because of statutes of
limitations on thefts of art and antiquities.
   <PERSON>Ely Maurer</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION> assistant legal adviser for
cultural property, said criminal charges might be pursued under the
National Stolen Property Act. The law prohibits interstate or
international transport of stolen art or artifacts.
   The law might be extended to heirs if they knew the art was
stolen and transferred it across state lines, <PERSON>Maurer</PERSON> said.

<HEAD>East German Church Files Lawsuit in Artwork Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An East German church has filed a lawsuit
demanding the return of medieval artwork believed stolen by an
American officer in the final days of World War II.
   After hearing oral arguments by telephone <DATE>Monday</DATE>, <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> District
<PERSON>Judge Sidney A. Fitzwater</PERSON> barred movement of the church treasures
without a court order.
   Fitzwater also ordered that representatives of the Lutheran
cathedral in Quedlinburg be allowed to inventory the cache. The
artwork is believed to be held in a bank in <LOCATION>Whitewright</LOCATION>, a town of
1,760 about 60 miles north of <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION>.
   The church hopes to recover 15 treasures that had been hidden in
a mineshaft during the war. The treasures disappeared in <DATE>1945</DATE>,
shortly after American forces occupied the medieval castle town.
   Among the treasures, said <PERSON>Thomas R. Kline</PERSON>, the lawyer who filed
the lawsuit, are a rock crystal flask of Byzantine origin; a wooden
box decorated with silver, gold, ivory and precious stones, dating
from the 9th or 10th century and containing relics of Henry I; and
two manuscripts, one from about <DATE>1300</DATE> and the other from <DATE>1515</DATE>, bound
in precious metals and encrusted with gems.
   <PERSON>Joe T. Meador</PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> lieutenant who was among the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
troops who entered Quedlinburg in <DATE>April 1945</DATE>, is believed to have
stolen the artifacts.
   After he died of cancer in <DATE>1980</DATE>, his brother and sister, <PERSON>Jack
Meador</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Whitewright</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Jane Meador Cook</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Mesquite</ORGANIZATION>, obtained
the treasures and stored at least some in a vault at the <ORGANIZATION>First
National Bank</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>The Dallas Morning News</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>today</DATE>.
   They apparently sold at least two of the pieces, the bejeweled
illuminated manuscripts, the newspaper said.
   A secretary for <PERSON>Jack Meador</PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION>The Associated Press</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Monday</DATE>
<TIME>night</TIME> that <PERSON>Meador</PERSON> had no comment on the lawsuit. <PERSON>Mrs. Cook</PERSON> also
declined to comment.
   An affidavit filed with the lawsuit said a church representative
had met with bank President <PERSON>John Farley</PERSON> to demand the treasures.
Farley confirmed that some of the artifacts are at his bank, The
<ORGANIZATION>New York Times</ORGANIZATION> reported today.
   <PERSON>Farley</PERSON> said he first saw the artworks in <DATE>1986</DATE> ``when a customer
of the bank brought me two manuscripts to have appraised.'' He
would not reveal the customer's name or disclose the number of
artworks stored in the bank.
   <PERSON>Ely Maurer</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION> assistant legal adviser for
cultural property, said the lawsuit was filed primarily because
negotiations for return of the collection reached an impasse during
the weekend.
   An unidentified <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> agent was quoted by the <ORGANIZATION>Morning News</ORGANIZATION> as
saying it was unclear whether charges could be brought in the case.
   He said that the statute of limitations for interstate
transportation of stolen property is five years and that
international treaties governing theft of art and antiquities have
a 30-year statute of limitations.
   <PERSON>Maurer</PERSON> said charges might be pursued under the National Stolen
Property Act, a statute prohibiting interstate or international
transport of stolen art.
   ``The law would extend to heirs who knowingly transferred the
property across state lines,'' <PERSON>Maurer</PERSON> said. ``The fact that they
moved some of the artworks as recently as this year might make the
statute apply.''
   He said there is evidence the family knew for some time that the
art was stolen.

<HEAD>Army: Records of Stolen Art Probe Destroyed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENISON, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> said it has thrown out all
records of its investigation into the World War II theft of German
medieval artworks that wound up in a small town in <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>.
   As a result, the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> may never know whether a former soldier
from <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> who died in <DATE>1980</DATE> was a suspect in the theft, an <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION>
spokeswoman told <ORGANIZATION>The Denison Herald</ORGANIZATION> in an interview published
<DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   The artifacts, some of them stored in the vault of the <ORGANIZATION>First
National Bank</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Whitewright</LOCATION>, have been valued in the <MONEY>millions of
dollars</MONEY> by German art experts.
   A Lutheran church in <LOCATION>Quedlinburg</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>East Germany</LOCATION>, is suing to
recover the artwork from the bank and the late <PERSON>Joe T. Meador</PERSON>'s
family.
   Meador is believed to have stolen the objects while an <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION>
lieutenant, and stashed them in his hometown about 60 miles north
of <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION>. He left the artifacts to a brother and sister.
   Army military police investigated the theft, but the file was
apparently destroyed in <DATE>1964</DATE> when records of all cases older than
15 years were purged, <PERSON>Barbara Parker</PERSON>, a spokeswoman at the <ORGANIZATION>U.S.
Army Crime Records Center</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Fort Holabird</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Md.</LOCATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION>Herald</ORGANIZATION>.
   Only records of historical interest survived the housecleaning,
<PERSON>Parker</PERSON> said.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> abandoned the case in <DATE>1949</DATE> when Quedlinburg became part
of <LOCATION>East Germany</LOCATION>. Army spokesmen have said it is unclear whether the
military will reopen the case.
   The articles allegedly taken by <PERSON>Meador</PERSON> include a silver, ivory
and gold reliquary from the 9th or <DATE>10th century</DATE>, a 10th century
Byzantine rock-crystal flask with sides formed like birds and an
ivory comb inlaid with precious stones.
   Meador's heirs, <PERSON>Jack Meador</PERSON>, 70, and <PERSON>Jane Cook</PERSON>, 58, said <DATE>earlier
this week</DATE> that their unoccupied farmhouse was ransacked <DATE>Monday</DATE>
<TIME>night</TIME> by burglars who mistakenly believed the treasure was there.
   The burglary was described in a motion filed by <PERSON>Meador</PERSON> and <PERSON>Ms.
Cook</PERSON> seeking a protective order to keep all parties in the lawsuit
from discussing the case in public. <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> District <PERSON>Judge Sidney A.
Fitzwater</PERSON> denied the motion <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
   The bank had acknowledged the artifacts are in the vault.
Fitzwater has ordered the bank to allow representatives of the
church to inventory and photograph the artifacts.
   Denison is 70 miles north of <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION>.

<HEAD>West Germany Buying Back Art that `Wandered' During Nazi Era</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Quietly, unobtrusively and with limited
funds, <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION> has been buying back important artworks that
left the country during the Nazi era.
   Officials involved in the slow recovery of what Germans call
their ``wandered culture'' decline to say how much they've spent to
bring home some historically important works.
   But at least <MONEY>$29 million</MONEY> is known to have been spent over the
past five years in the effort the government has deliberately kept
on a low key.
   <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION> struggles with a particularly acute problem of
exiled art because of the volume of works sold during World War II
to help bankroll the Nazi war effort.
   Thousands of paintings, manuscripts, sculptures and other
cultural goods were salvaged from private collections or produced
abroad by Jews and intellectuals hounded from their homeland by
<PERSON>Adolf Hitler</PERSON>'s regime. But only a fraction of the displaced art made
its way back to <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> after the war.
   ``We have no defined plan for buying up all the important
artworks that have wandered out of the country over the years, but
when the opportunity arises we make our best effort to get back what
has been lost,'' explained <PERSON>Hans Hieronymus</PERSON>, who heads the <ORGANIZATION>Interior
Ministry</ORGANIZATION>'s office responsible for art acquisitions.
   In an interview with <ORGANIZATION>The Associated Press</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Hieronymus</PERSON> produced a
list of the major works repatriated over the past few months. They
included three 16th century paintings by <PERSON>Albrecht Durer</PERSON>, original
compositions of <PERSON>Richard Wagner</PERSON> and <PERSON>Robert Schumann</PERSON>, <PERSON>Franz Kafka</PERSON>'s
<DATE>1920</DATE> manuscript of ``The Trial'' and some personal letters, and a
<DATE>1463</DATE> edition of ``The Apocalypse,'' one of the earliest products of
<PERSON>Johann Gutenberg</PERSON>'s block-printing press.
   The most stunning indication of <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION>'s commitment to
restoration of <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>'s cultural heritage was the purchase five
years ago of <ORGANIZATION>The Gospel of Henry</ORGANIZATION> the Lionhearted, a handwritten,
552-page, 12th century volume that has commanded the highest price
to date for a book _ <MONEY>$18.8 million</MONEY>.
   A government art appraiser, <PERSON>Hartmut Vogel</PERSON>, says the <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> the
Lionhearted purchase was an inspiring success for West German art
circles as it rewarded an unprecedented effort of cooperation among
the sometimes fractious state and federal art dealers and private
cultural foundations.
   ``This was our masterpiece acquisition, but for the most part our
funds are too small to achieve much headway,'' <PERSON>Vogel</PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION>AP</ORGANIZATION>.
   He alluded to the purchase in mid-November of the Kafka
manuscript by the state of <LOCATION>Baden-Wuerttemberg</LOCATION> as a bargain at <MONEY>$1.98
million</MONEY>. But that kind of surprise acquisition is unlikely to be
pulled off with any degree of frequency, he conceded.
   ``We have to be careful not to appear to be hunting dogs,'' said
<PERSON>Verena Tafel</PERSON>, one of five art historians busy collecting works for
<LOCATION>West Berlin</LOCATION>'s Museum of German History, expected to open in the <DATE>late
1990s</DATE>.
   ``Every national museum tries to repatriate those artworks that
were lost during the Nazi regime,'' <PERSON>Ms. Tafel</PERSON> said. ``But being too
aggressive can have the result of driving the prices up.''
   An official with the <ORGANIZATION>Interior Ministry</ORGANIZATION> who spoke only on
condition of anonymity said recovery of famous German works from
abroad is an important facet of the government's acquisition policy,
``but we'd be stupid to publicly present this as a campaign.''
   He explained that a restrained profile in the international art
market is essential in outbidding hesitant competitors, and for West
German buyers to put out the word that they are embarked on a
repatriation project would serve only to price themselves out of the
market.
   <PERSON>Ms. Tafel</PERSON> noted, however, that museum collectors have to maintain
a delicate balance between discretion and enlisting popular support.
After learning of the West German government's plan to open a
historical museum in <LOCATION>West Berlin</LOCATION>, she said, the <ORGANIZATION>St. Louis Science
Center</ORGANIZATION> this <DATE>fall</DATE> returned free of charge an early German-made
scientific model of the human body that had been taken out of the
country during the Nazi period.
   Earlier this year, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> government agreed to return about
6,200 paintings and drawings from the Nazi period that were
confiscated at the end of World War II. The propaganda artworks
commissioned by Hitler to depict model soldiers and citizens are
currently in storage at the <ORGANIZATION>Bavarian Army Museum</ORGANIZATION> in Ingolstadt
pending official decisions on how they should be presented.
   In cases where outright purchase is the only means of retrieving
expatriated artworks or items of special interest for German
museums, West German buyers concede they are fighting a losing
battle against wealthy Japanese collectors and British and American
curators with claims to significantly larger private funding sources.
   Sabine Fehlemann, director of the <ORGANIZATION>Von der Heydt Museum</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Wuppertal</LOCATION>, traveled to <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> on <DATE>Nov. 28</DATE> with authorization to bid
as high as <MONEY>$5.8 million</MONEY> for <ORGANIZATION>Pablo Picasso</ORGANIZATION>'s ``The Acrobat and the
Young Harlequin.'' The bidding was opened at <MONEY>$8.6 million</MONEY> and closed
with the <MONEY>$38.6 million</MONEY> offer of <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> collector <PERSON>Akio Nishino</PERSON>.
   The <DATE>1905</DATE> masterpiece was a treasured possession of <LOCATION>Wuppertal</LOCATION>
until <DATE>1937</DATE>, when Nazi forces confiscated the painting, declared it
``degenerate art'' and sold it to a Swiss collector for 80,000 Swiss
francs.
   ``I thought we had little chance,'' <PERSON>Ms. Fehlemann</PERSON> said after the
auction. ``But I wanted to see our Picasso just once more before it
disappears into a Japanese repository.''
   West German state collectors contend they enjoy fewer advantages
in the international art arena than their competitors because of the
dearth of private foundations to generate funds for public
acquisitions.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Interior Ministry</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Hieronymus</PERSON> explained that public
offerings of important artworks often are advertised only a few
weeks or days prior to the auction, triggering a scramble for
donations from each of the 10 West German states, the federal
government and the public foundations. The cumbersome effort often
serves to stall presentation of a reasonable bid, he conceded.
   Increasingly priced out of the market for the best-known works,
the state collectors have concentrated instead on preventing the
further migration of German treasures.
   Under a <DATE>1955</DATE> law that charges the state with protecting national
culture, some 1,000 artworks in <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION> are designated by the
government as national valuables, restricting though not prohibiting
their sale or exchange abroad.
   ``We have to concentrate on preventing further losses,'' <PERSON>Ms.
Tafel</PERSON> said.
   ``In general, if a famous German work of art is on public display
in another country, that's enough to make us happy,'' she said.
``We're not like <PERSON>Melina Mercouri</PERSON> (the former actress who is <LOCATION>Greece</LOCATION>'s
culture minster) _ we don't insist that everything must come back.''

<HEAD>Museum Expects Return of Art Treasures from Soviets Soon</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WEST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A West German museum said <DATE>today</DATE> it soon
expects to recover 362 valuable drawings and watercolors taken
during World War II, including works by <PERSON>Duerer</PERSON>, <PERSON>Rubens</PERSON> and van Gogh.
   The works were taken to the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> after the war _ one of
numerous cases of treasures plundered or spirited away from the
defeated nation.
   <PERSON>Ursula Lichtlein</PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION>Kunsthalle Bremen</ORGANIZATION>
museum, said officials there expect the 362 art works will be
returned next month or in <DATE>October</DATE>.
   She cautioned that ``negotiations are still under way'' with
<LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION>, including questions of whether any payment will be involved.
   ``We have organized an exhibition for next year, so that we can
show the returned works to the public,'' <PERSON>Ms. Lichtlein</PERSON> said by
telephone from the northern port city of <LOCATION>Bremen</LOCATION>.
   The way the <LOCATION>Bremen</LOCATION> drawings and watercolors reached the <LOCATION>Soviet
Union</LOCATION> sounds almost like the plot from a suspense novel.
   In <DATE>1945</DATE>, as the <ORGANIZATION>Red Army</ORGANIZATION> advanced on <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>, a Soviet soldier
stumbled across the stunning collection of drawings and watercolors
stashed in a castle for safekeeping.
   The soldier, an architect in an engineering corps, bundled what
he could off to <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION>, where he stored them in a museum. There
they sat, covered and concealed from the world.
   Now the aging soldier says the pieces should go back to the
<LOCATION>Kunsthalle Bremen</LOCATION>, their true owner.
   Kunsthalle <LOCATION>Bremen</LOCATION> director <PERSON>Siegfried Salzmann</PERSON> says about 4,000
items went to a castle northwest of <LOCATION>Berlin</LOCATION> ``to prevent damage by
air attacks.'' Soviet troops occupied the area in <DATE>April 1945</DATE>.
   The Soviet soldier, <PERSON>Viktor Baldin</PERSON>, asked his superiors what was
to be done with the art and when they showed no interest, he packed
off what he could to <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Salzmann</PERSON> said.
   Some of the museum's wartime treasures were returned after <DATE>1945</DATE>,
but many others are still missing, <PERSON>Salzmann</PERSON> said.
   The soldier, now in his 70s, contacted the <LOCATION>Bremen</LOCATION> museum last
year and told them for the first time that some of what they had
given up for lost was secure in <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION>.
   ``We supposed they could be in the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>, but we didn't
know,'' <PERSON>Salzmann</PERSON> said in an earlier <ORGANIZATION>Associated Press</ORGANIZATION> interview. He
was on a business trip <DATE>today</DATE> and could not be reached for comment.
   The museum has invited <LOCATION>Baldin</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Bremen</LOCATION> in <DATE>September</DATE> to help
write a reminiscence for the museum's catalog. Other artists'
represented included <ORGANIZATION>Rembrandt</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Degas</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Manet</PERSON>, van Dyck and <ORGANIZATION>Goya</ORGANIZATION>.
   Bremen's art treasures are stored for now in a museum in <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION>.
   During World War II, museums, libraries and churches packed up
their most valuable works and shipped them off for safekeeping,
often to the eastern reaches of <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>, away from Allied bombers.
   In a <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> court, an East German church financed by <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION>
is fighting the heirs of a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> soldier who the church claims made
off with a cache of priceless objects hidden in a mine.
   <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> forces occupied the Quedlinburg area, in what is now <LOCATION>East
Germany</LOCATION>, in <DATE>1945</DATE>.
   The treasures include a silver, ivory and gold reliquary from
the 9th or <DATE>10th century</DATE>, a 10th century Byzantine rock-crystal
flask and an ivory comb inlaid with precious stones.

   Croatia's Art and Architecture Buried in Rubble

   Zagreb, Yugoslavia -- Smack in the middle of Europe,
divided by warring Byzantine and Frankish, Ottoman and
Austro-Hungarian claims to sovereignty, Yugoslavia's
Dalmatian coast has long been trod upon, plowed under and
fought over by a variety of civilizing influences with
dishonorable intentions: Saracens, Bulgaro-Macedonians,
Serbs, Venetians, Austro-Hungarians, Ottomans and Nazis. And
then there are the periodic earthquakes that shake up the
coastal towns, a matter of nature taking up where man-made
destruction leaves off.
   Through all of this, the medieval city of Dubrovnik -- an
almost perfectly preserved town that was once the seat of the
Republic of Ragusa -- has managed to remain intact. Until
now. More than 40% of the inner city has been destroyed in
the civil war between Serbs and Croats that began seven
months ago. The Serb-controlled federal navy showed up in
port in October and began shelling the 14th-century city
walls. In three months of fierce artillery and mortar
attacks, many of Dubrovnik's fine Gothic and Renaissance
structures have been reduced to rubble or burned down; what
remains has been scarred and pockmarked by federal forces
bent on teaching the secessionist Croats a lesson neither
they nor the rest of the world is likely to forget.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In a civil war that has claimed so many lives and
displaced more than half a million people -- mostly Croats
fleeing the inexorable advance of the federal army -- concern
for carved stone and painted wood, however beautiful, may
seem fatuous. On the other hand, the sheer tonnage of
materiel dropped on <LOCATION>Croatia</LOCATION>, far more than the firepower
needed to secure key cities and land, belies the purely
aesthetic character of the damage. The wholesale destruction
of Croatian art and architecture has a sinister political
significance. Indeed, the Serb-backed forces seem bent on
destroying everything that bears witness to <LOCATION>Croatia</LOCATION>'s potent
national identity.
   Hence the disproportionate number of historical, cultural
and religious buildings struck by shelling and bombing; the
more precious the site, the more vulnerable it is to attack.
The <ORGANIZATION>Ministry of Culture</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Croatia</LOCATION> claims that more than 500
monuments and historical buildings have been damaged or
destroyed in the fighting. Sacred buildings, notably Roman
Catholic churches, monasteries and cemeteries, are especially
popular targets: In just seven months of fighting, nearly 250
have been hit. The other repositories of <LOCATION>Croatia</LOCATION>'s cultural
heritage are another army favorite; more than 370 museums,
libraries and archives have been damaged or destroyed.
   What's more, the monuments destroyed or under threat are
among the most beautiful in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>; they represent a trove of
European art and architecture that stretches from antiquity
to the <DATE>18th century</DATE>. A look at the places hardest hit by
federal troops makes it clear that they do not waste their
shells on insignificant buildings or plain little towns; in
<DATE>November</DATE>, Yugoslavian gunboats shelled the old coastal town
of Split, hitting the 11th-century <ORGANIZATION>St. Trinity Church</ORGANIZATION>, the
cathedral converted in the seventh century from <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON>'s
<LOCATION>Mausoleum</LOCATION>, and the newly excavated fourth-century Palace of
Diocletian. This palace, the largest and perhaps most perfect
example of late Roman palatial architecture extant, survived
the decline and fall of the Roman empire but has not
withstood the demise of the 20th-century Soviet empire built
in part on its foundations. A view of Split from the sea once
showed a gently aged jumble of Roman, medieval and
Renaissance buildings, their hard edges softened by centuries
of discreet decay; now the newly jagged skyline is decorated
by truncated spires and gaping holes in the city walls.
   The federal government's forces have also destroyed
several towns on the Serbo-Croatian front in the Yugoslav
interior. Vukovar, an ancient city on the <LOCATION>Danube</LOCATION> with many
buildings dating from the 16th-century Turkish occupation,
was substantially demolished in shelling during the early
months of the war. All that remains of one old quarter of the
town is half a church belfry and the <ORGANIZATION>Renaissance</ORGANIZATION> portico of
the narthex that stand precariously amid the
indistinguishable lumps of rubble that once made up the rest
of the church. In neighboring <LOCATION>Ilok</LOCATION>, a Yugoslavian patrol boat
on the Danube shelled the 15th-century <ORGANIZATION>St. John Capistran
Church</ORGANIZATION> and monastery; the roof has caved in and the
monastery's rich furnishings and considerable library have
been exposed by gaping holes in the walls.
   Such cities as <LOCATION>Dubrovnik</LOCATION> and Split are lucky in that they
retain much of their pre-war look and identity despite the
damage. But <LOCATION>Karlovac</LOCATION> is another matter altogether. The
16th-century <PERSON>Habsburg</PERSON> town built in the shape of a
six-pointed star has been hit by repeated waves of mortar and
shelling from the federal government's assault on this
strategic town. By mid-December, both <LOCATION>Karlovac</LOCATION>'s industrial
sector and the old historical center had been razed by the
fighting, blurring the once-distinctive pattern created by
Hapsburg architects. More recently, however, the bombs came
so thick and fast (more than 500 mortars were fired on one
late <DATE>December</DATE> day) that no one knows how much or how little
remains.
   The Croat government in <LOCATION>Zagreb</LOCATION> takes its cultural heritage
seriously and has moved much of its portable art, including
paintings, icons and sculptures, and its sizable archives to
underground bunkers. But the army mortar often gets there
first, and much of the Renaissance and baroque art that
decorated the churches has been lost; what remains once the
smoke clears is carried off by looters. After <ORGANIZATION>Vukovar</ORGANIZATION>'s old
Eltz castle was blitzed, its archives disappeared along with
its paintings and a valuable prehistoric collection excavated
from the neighboring settlement of Vucedol. A source in
<LOCATION>Belgrade</LOCATION> claims that the federal government has stockpiled a
huge collection of medieval and <ORGANIZATION>Renaissance</ORGANIZATION> art stolen from
Croatian churches. "We only hope," says a weary archivist
from the eastern town of <LOCATION>Osijek</LOCATION>, heavily battered by the Serb
forces that surround it on three sides, "that the Serbs
appreciate the value of all the loot they have carted off."
   It appears, to Croatians at least, as if the rest of the
world has been standing by while <LOCATION>Croatia</LOCATION> slowly drowns in its
own rubble. As is often the case, it has been left to a small
group of art historians, patrons and restorers under the
aegis of the <ORGANIZATION>Croatian Ministry of Culture</ORGANIZATION>, the
Kunsthistorisches museum in <LOCATION>Vienna</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Francesca
Thyssen-Bornemisza</PERSON>'s ARCH foundation, an organization set up
to protect the cultural patrimony in <LOCATION>Eastern Europe</LOCATION>, to do
something. The group has set about compiling an inventory of
destroyed, lost or damaged property and is busy collecting
the material and equipment needed to restore the damaged
monuments and protect those that have been spared by the
federal pyrotechnics. Following a two-day conference held in
<LOCATION>Zagreb</LOCATION> in <DATE>December</DATE>, the group called on <ORGANIZATION>Unesco</ORGANIZATION> to sponsor a
fact-finding mission to assess the damage and to look into
the many artifacts carted off by looters and thought to be
stashed away in <LOCATION>Belgrade</LOCATION>. So far, the answer from <ORGANIZATION>Unesco</ORGANIZATION> has
been a resounding silence.
   A two-week-old ceasefire continued to hold yesterday as
the 12 members of the <ORGANIZATION>European Community</ORGANIZATION>, as well as a number
of non-EC countries such as <LOCATION>Austria</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Ukraine</LOCATION>, recognized
<LOCATION>Croatia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Slovenia</LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION> sent 50 unarmed
peacekeepers to the area on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> and promised as many as
10,000 if the truce is maintained. But fighting could begin
again any day. And unfortunately, no proposal drawn up by a
group of concerned art historians, however courageous, is
likely to prove equal to the Soviet-style arsenal still
available to the federal side. Until a definitive political
solution is reached, the destruction of both <LOCATION>Croatia</LOCATION>'s and
the world's cultural heritage will continue -- not only in
the shelling of churches and archaeological sites but also in
the destruction of <LOCATION>Croatia</LOCATION>'s vernacular culture, its wooden
farming villages and churches, less likely to be restored
than the grander historical monuments.

IT'S A FAKE; 
</P>
<P>
ART: AN EXHIBIT AT POMONA COLLEGE GIVES VIEWERS THE CHANCE TO SEE MORE THAN TWO 
DOZEN CLEVER COPIES.

</HEADLINE>

<P>
Pretend you are a wealthy art collector. Before you are two medieval 
manuscripts, both painted on vellum, both showing centuries of wear. 
Unfortunately, one is a fake. 
</P>
<P>
How will you discern which manuscript dates back to medieval times and which 
was painted by a notorious Spanish forger in the <DATE>19th</DATE> Century? 
</P>
<P>
You might start by honing your connoisseurship at <ORGANIZATION>Pomona College</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Montgomery 
Gallery</ORGANIZATION>, where "Artful Deception: The Craft of the Forger" is on display 
through <DATE>Dec. 2</DATE>. The exhibit, which is traveling across the country, was 
organized by curators at the <ORGANIZATION>Walters Art Gallery</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
At this unusual show, viewers get a glimpse of more than two dozen fakes -- 
from 16th-Century Russian icons to the "Mona Lisa" to ancient busts of Roman 
youths. In some cases, the fakes are paired with genuine works in the same 
style. Viewers are invited to study them, read about the actual artist's style 
and background, then choose which piece they think is authentic. Sliding open a 
panel reveals whether the viewer has a future in art scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
As compelling as the "whodunit" tests are the cloak-and-dagger tales that 
accompany the forgeries, many of which have been exhibited as genuine for 
years. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, the "Spanish forger" who faked the medieval manuscripts was a 
highly skilled and clever painter who went to great lengths to disguise his 
forgeries by using vellum that dated back to the Middle Ages, painting in the 
style of medieval illuminators and then "aging" his works. 
</P>
<P>
The forger, who art historians think was actually a Frenchman working in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> 
during the Victorian era, went undetected in his own time. But 20th-Century art 
historians notice -- as <PERSON>Montgomery</PERSON> patrons may also -- that the forger was 
undone by his faces. To the contemporary eye, they smack of the cloying 
sweetness of the Victorian era and do not reflect the more somber, pious style 
of painters who worked in the Middle Ages. 
</P>
<P>
Copying important works of art is a practice that dates back to ancient <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>, 
says <ORGANIZATION>Montgomery Gallery</ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON>Marjorie L. Harth</PERSON>, who points out that not all 
fakes and forgeries were initially meant to deceive. 
</P>
<P>
The Romans, for instance, loved the classical Greek style and commissioned 
numerous copies of Greek art that were considered legitimate and highly 
desirable. 
</P>
<P>
Other artists were illicitly copied during their own lifetimes. Painter and 
wood engraver <PERSON>Albrecht Durer</PERSON> went to court in the early 16th Century to halt 
reproductions. On the other hand, <PERSON>Rubens</PERSON> and Rembrandt encouraged their 
students and assistants to copy their work as a way to learn the master's 
style. 
</P>
<P>
And <PERSON>Jean Baptiste Camille Corot</PERSON> (1796-1875) occasionally signed his students' 
works to help them professionally in their careers, thus muddying the waters 
for generations of art historians to come. As a result, says <PERSON>Harth</PERSON>, practically 
all Corots -- especially landscapes such as the one represented in the <LOCATION>Pomona</LOCATION> 
show -- have come under suspicion. 
</P>
<P>
The public's fascination with art and forgeries may be heightened by the 
<MONEY>millions of dollars</MONEY> that masterpieces command today on world markets, <PERSON>Harth</PERSON> 
says. A Van Gogh self-portrait in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>'s Metropolitan Museum of Art was 
recently removed from display when its authenticity was questioned. Ditto the 
"Kouros," a classical Greek bust of a youth displayed by the <ORGANIZATION>J. Paul Getty 
Museum</ORGANIZATION>, which came under suspicion when a very similar sculpture known to be a 
fake appeared on the market. 
</P>
<P>
The <LOCATION>Pomona</LOCATION> show explains the high-tech tools today's art historian uses to 
detect fakes: X-rays, infrared photographs and pigment analysis. One work in 
the show, a supposed early 16th-Century "Venetian Renaissance" panel painting 
of <PERSON>St. George</PERSON> slaying the dragon, was revealed as a 19th-Century fake after the 
<ORGANIZATION>Walters Conservation</ORGANIZATION> Lab noticed some suspiciously heavy overpainting on the 
canvas. 
</P>
<P>
An X-ray revealed a late 16th-Century painting of the <DATE>Last Supper</DATE> underneath. 
Subsequent analysis showed that the scene of <PERSON>St. George</PERSON> and the dragon was 
painted over the earlier work in the <DATE>19th Century</DATE>. The curators have removed 
several sections of the forgery to reveal the head of one of <ORGANIZATION>Christ</ORGANIZATION>'s disciples 
and the small dog at <ORGANIZATION>Christ</ORGANIZATION>'s feet, giving patrons a fascinating glimpse at a 
forgery exposed. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to technical tools, historians use their knowledge to match 
artistic styles and flourishes with the appropriate cultures and epochs. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Harth</PERSON> calls it "the complicated, interrelated workings of eye and brain." 
Perception, he says, is determined by context, "by the conditions, physical and 
intellectual, under which we see the work." 
</P>
<P>
"Once you know which one is authentic, it will look better than it did, and the 
one labeled fake will look worse," <PERSON>Harth</PERSON> promises. 
</P>
<P>
Fakes provide fascinating reference points for art historians. Like a slightly 
warped mirror, they reflect a skewed view of artistic reality -- but as with 
any illusion, they draw the viewer in. 
</P>
<P>
"Fakes speak eloquently of fallibility and of gullibility," <PERSON>Harth</PERSON> says. "Fakes 
. . . teach us to understand and to value authenticity in art." 
</P>
<P>
Forgers often are unable to transcend the barriers of their own time. A bust of 
a king from ancient <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>'s Ptolemaic dynasty is revealed as a fake by the 
playful, naive and human expression on the face. Walters curators say this is 
greatly at odds with the work of ancient Egyptian stone carvers, who depicted 
their kings as men of strength and power -- austere, remote and on a plane 
above mere mortals. 
</P>
<P>
Other times, fakes give themselves away by sloppy inattention to detail. A 
"Gothic" ivory carving in the exhibit was revealed as a fake when scholars 
noticed that <PERSON>St. Catherine</PERSON> is seated in the center, with the apostles <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> and 
<PERSON>Paul</PERSON> to the sides. A true Gothic carver, pious and theologically schooled, 
would never have ranked a mere saint above the apostles. 
</P>
<P>
Cross-cultural faking is even more difficult than that which attempts to 
transcend epochs. A pink ceramic vessel, allegedly from 18th-Century <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>'s 
<ORGANIZATION>Ching Dynasty</ORGANIZATION>, is revealed as a 19th-Century Western European imitation by its 
lack of subtlety and its inability to reproduce the two-dimensional composition 
of Asian art popular at that time. 
</P>
<P>
Often, however, forgers are artists in their own right and earn the grudging 
admiration of art historians for their clever, albeit misplaced, genius. 
</P>
<P>
Icilio <PERSON>Federico Joni</PERSON> (1866-1946) was a Sienese painter, restorer, art dealer 
and forger who specialized in Renaissance paintings. Joni, who often used 
panels that dated from the Renaissance to throw historians off the scent, was 
unmasked because he allowed too many paintings to trace their provenance, or 
ownership history, back to him. In addition, <PERSON>Joni</PERSON> gave all the characters in 
his paintings the same long, broad noses and elaborate halos. 
</P>
<P>
Then there was <PERSON>Reinhold Vasters</PERSON> (1827-1909), the nearly perfect forger. A 
master goldsmith from <LOCATION>Aachen</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>, Vasters forged jewelry and decorative 
works in Renaissance style but was never exposed during his lifetime. The 
forgeries came to light in the early <DATE>1980s</DATE>, when the working drawings for his 
fakes were discovered in the storerooms of the <LOCATION>Victoria</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Albert Museum</ORGANIZATION> in 
<LOCATION>London</LOCATION>. Perhaps, say the <PERSON>Walters</PERSON> curators, he left documentation to salve his 
ego and assure himself that his talent -- and his ability to fool the experts 
of his time -- would one day be known to all. 
</P>
<P>
Forgeries aren't always aesthetically inferior, either. Of the two <ORGANIZATION>Sevres</ORGANIZATION> 
clocks on display at the gallery, <PERSON>Harth</PERSON> says several curators would argue that 
the fake is actually superior. 
</P>
<P>
So what, then, is wrong with fakes? 
</P>
<P>
The <PERSON>Walters</PERSON> curators say: "A discredited work of art can only distort and 
obscure our view of the past." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Harth</PERSON> adds that a forgery blemishes the reputation of the real artist and, 
perhaps more dangerously, creates a false basis of information about the artist 
and the period in question with which to judge future works. 
</P>
<P>
What makes Dutch painter Jan Vermeer (1632-1675) great, <PERSON>Harth</PERSON> says, "is not 
only that he painted beautiful pictures but that he painted certain pictures in 
a certain way at a certain time in the history and development of art. In 
addition to the craftsmanship, technique and cleverness of the painting, it 
shows genuine creative achievement."

Chillon! Thy prison is a holy place, 
</P>
<P>
 And thy sad floor an altar -- for 'twas trod, 
</P>
<P>
 Until his very steps have left a trace 
</P>
<P>
 Worn, as if thy cold pavement were a sod, 
</P>
<P>
 By Bonivard! ... 
</P>
<P>
 -- <PERSON>Lord Byron</PERSON> 
</P>
<P>
The rocky islet of <LOCATION>Chillon</LOCATION>, which <ORGANIZATION>Lord Byron</ORGANIZATION> helped make famous in the above 
sonnet and in his longer poem, "The Prisoner of Chillon," hugs the eastern end 
of <PERSON>Lake Leman</PERSON> (best known as <LOCATION>Lake Geneva</LOCATION>) a few kilometers from here. 
</P>
<P>
Byron created an unforgettable portrait of <PERSON>Francois Bonivard</PERSON>, who languished 
for four years in the <LOCATION>Chillon</LOCATION> castle dungeon. Even if not exactly true to the 
facts, the poem is a heart-rending statement of a man's devotion to his 
religious beliefs and a splendid introduction to one of <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>'s most exemplary 
castles. 
</P>
<P>
Chillon, even without <PERSON>Byron</PERSON>'s testimony, imposes itself upon one's 
consciousness. Three semicircular towers of the <ORGANIZATION>13th Century</ORGANIZATION> dominate its 
exterior wall, while from the center of the fortress the castle keep rises 
above them. Edging in from the lake, the waters of the moat offer a tranquil 
contrast. 
</P>
<P>
The interior opens the darker aspects of castle life -- the dungeon, torture 
chamber, gibbet and arsenal, as well as its lighter side -- the banquet and 
receptions halls, bed chambers and chapel. 
</P>
<P>
These are aged spaces; they echo with stories of counts and dukes, of revelry 
and religiosity, of a spirit of long ago. 
</P>
<P>
Chillon is a "restored" castle, to peg it correctly. The Bernese of <LOCATION>Switzerland</LOCATION> 
shored it up after a strong earthquake in <DATE>1584</DATE>, but it was the archeologist 
<PERSON>Albert Naef</PERSON>, helped by detailed plans that showed the changes through the ages, 
who did the major work of restoration at the end of the <DATE>19th Century</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Chillon served many functions. At one time a fortress, a lookout, a princely 
residence, an administrative center, prison and arsenal, the building -- 
perforce -- always needed a bit of remodeling. 
</P>
<P>
The Romans, judging from coins and other remains founded in excavations in 
<DATE>1896</DATE>, probably used the rock as an outpost. Later generations recognized the 
strategic position of this little islet: Between the lake and the mountains it 
stood above the narrow road that led south into <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>. It was an ideal spot for 
defense and to collect taxes on goods that passed that way. 
</P>
<P>
The castle keep, an old tower of refuge, probably was built in the 11th 
Century; on the land side -- the most vulnerable point of attack, the 
formidable towers, comprising a second exterior "curtain" wall, were added two 
centuries later. 
</P>
<P>
It was then that the <ORGANIZATION>House of Savoy</ORGANIZATION> held dominion over this part of 
<LOCATION>Switzerland</LOCATION>, and its counts made Chillon their ducal residence. The Bernese 
ended all that in <DATE>1536</DATE> when they captured the castle from their Catholic enemy 
and in the process freed its most famous prisoner. 
</P>
<P>
 Lake <PERSON>Leman</PERSON> lies by <ORGANIZATION>Chillon</ORGANIZATION>'s walls; 
</P>
<P>
 A thousand feet in depth below 
</P>
<P>
 Its mossy waters meet and flow; 
</P>
<P>
 Thus much the fathom-line was sent 
</P>
<P>
 From <ORGANIZATION>Chillon</ORGANIZATION>'s snow-white battlement, 
</P>
<P>
 Which round about the wave enthralls: 
</P>
<P>
 A double dungeon wall and wave 
</P>
<P>
 Have made -- and like a living grave. 
</P>
<P>
 As the prior of <ORGANIZATION>St. Victor</ORGANIZATION>'s, <PERSON>Francois Bonivard</PERSON> had been imprisoned by <PERSON>Duke 
Charles III</PERSON> of Savoy because he favored the Reformation and wanted to introduce 
it in <LOCATION>Geneva</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Byron, who visited Chillon in <DATE>1816</DATE>, cast the situation in his poem, taking a 
bit of artistic license in the process. By then, <PERSON>Byron</PERSON>'s celebrity 
notwithstanding, the castle had seen its better days; it was fast becoming a 
neglected anachronism. 
</P>
<P>
Years later the restoration changed all that, and today's visitor, with only a 
soupcon of imagination, can easily move back a few centuries in time. 
</P>
<P>
The old moat, having been cleared of detritus from the ages, still laps its 
water against grassy shore and stony wall. One crosses it via a covered bridge; 
it replaced the old drawbridge that must have succumbed to too many foot 
soldiers, too many closings and openings. 
</P>
<P>
Stately courtyards flanked by several levels of ceremonial halls and living 
quarters fill the upper floors, while down below, on the less penetrable lake 
side (surely the dankest part of the castle) the dungeon spreads its gloom. 
</P>
<P>
"There are seven pillars of Gothic mould,/ In Chillon's dungeon's deep and 
old," wrote the poet. But the vaulted ceiling and the columns of unembellished 
stone speak of a harmony, a quiet aesthetic, that belongs as much to a church 
as to a dungeon. 
</P>
<P>
From <DATE>1532</DATE> to 1536 Bonivard was here, chained to one of the pillars. The pillar 
still stands, close to the one where <PERSON>Byron</PERSON>, in the tradition of graffiti makers 
through the ages, carved his name. Now, 173 years later, the poet's name merits 
a glass-enclosed case, and like most graffiti, appears indestructible. 
</P>
<P>
Not far from the dungeon, castle restorers found the ruin of what was the 
original chapel, a tiny structure hiding such fragments as a delicate shrine 
and a Carolingian altar stone. 
</P>
<P>
Up above, the rooms evoke the more princely side of medieval life: the <PERSON>Hall</PERSON> of 
the <PERSON>Chatelain</PERSON> (the high bailiff), with its handsome windows and pillars from 
the Savoy period; the Bernese chambers, with their decorative 16th-Century wall 
patterns of flowers and birds, and the <ORGANIZATION>Hall of Knights</ORGANIZATION>, once the grand 
reception hall for the Savoyards, and later the official room of the Bernese 
high bailiffs of <LOCATION>Vevey</LOCATION>, lords of the castle, who made Chillon their residence 
from <DATE>1536</DATE> to <DATE>1733</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
The Bernese coats of arms are set in the walls; the Bernese added a large 
fireplace and mullioned windows that overlook the lake. 
</P>
<P>
Several of the halls serve as museums, wherein are displayed artifacts from the 
Middle Ages and early modern <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>: a musket from 1600, stone sculptures found 
in the moat and four large models that show the rock as it was, the first 
construction in the <DATE>9th Century</DATE> -- after <ORGANIZATION>Chillon</ORGANIZATION>'s strategic site became 
apparent, and the subsequent alterations. 
</P>
<P>
Among the oldest parts of the castle is the keep, a place where defenders of 
old could always, as a last resort, barricade themselves in its highest 
reaches. Builders over the centuries tried to make it all the more formidable, 
adding stories until it reached its present height of 86 feet. 
</P>
<P>
During the restoration its walls had to be reinforced. When they were opened, 
restorers found 50 large franc pieces minted during the 13th Century. One 
wonders whether they were deliberately put there for future generations to 
discover, or whether they were tucked away in some final act of desperation. 
</P>
<P>
It is a relatively easy climb up the gnarled wooden steps that lead to the top 
level of the keep, and from there one commands a panoramic view of the castle 
with its courtyards and machicolated towers, the lake, and, hovering above it 
all, the mountains. These are the same mountains that Bonivard, climbing up to 
a small window, looked at with such longing: 
</P>
<P>
 I saw them -- and they were the same, 
</P>
<P>
 They were not changed like me in frame; 
</P>
<P>
 I saw their thousand years of snow 
</P>
<P>
 On high -- their wide long lake below, 
</P>
<P>
 And the blue Rhone in fullest flow; 
</P>
<P>
 <ORGANIZATION>Bonivard</ORGANIZATION>'s story, preserved in <LOCATION>Byron</LOCATION>'s stirring lines, no doubt represents 
only one among the many that might be whispered from the walls and battlements, 
from the rooms and courtyards of Chillon. For <PERSON>Byron</PERSON>, for today's visitor, the 
castle stands as a venerable and remarkably authentic testament to another age, 
another spirit.

<ORGANIZATION>The Castle of Chillon</ORGANIZATION> is at the eastern end of <PERSON>Lake Leman</PERSON> about 90 kilometers 
from <LOCATION>Geneva</LOCATION>. A train from <LOCATION>Geneva Airport</LOCATION> can get you to Chillon in less than an 
hour; the drive by car along the northern edge of the lake, via <LOCATION>Lausanne</LOCATION>, takes 
about an hour and a half. 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>Montreux</LOCATION>, about two kilometers away, along with <LOCATION>Vevey</LOCATION> a little to the west, are 
the main resorts at this end of the lake. The cities offer an exciting night 
life -- casinos and discos as well as a full range of hotels in all price 
categories. 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>Hyatt Continental</ORGANIZATION> and the Hotel Excelsior are among the deluxe hotels. Just 
three minutes away from the castle is the Bonivard, a 19th-Century hotel 
recently refurbished. Many of the hotels offer packages: three days and two 
nights, starting at <MONEY>$75</MONEY> <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> per person. Weeklong packages also are available.

FT  06 MAR 93 / Arts: City overflowing with art - Patricia Morison gets to
know Rubens and his compatriots better
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE are sadly limited folk for whom true beauty exists only in the piazzas
of cities beyond the Alps. But if your senses respond to the north, then
<LOCATION>Antwerp</LOCATION> is without question one of the most beautiful cities of northern
<LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>.
This great maritime city on the <LOCATION>Scheldt</LOCATION> has its sombre side, its rotting
Renaissance facades and defaced Baroque Calvaries. Nonetheless, to my mind
<PERSON>Victor Hugo</PERSON>'s judgment is spot on; 'The city is delightful: paintings in the
churches, sculpture adorning the houses, <PERSON>Rubens</PERSON> in the chapels . . . the
city is literally overflowing with art.'
In Hugo's day, <LOCATION>Antwerp</LOCATION>'s dozen or so museums did not exist. Nor, of course,
did the city's newly restored Central Station and any number of
extraordinary late-19th and early 20th-century architectural extravaganzas.
Now there is <LOCATION>Antwerp</LOCATION> 93, and a notable group of exhibitions which will
ensure that the art-lover will indeed find this a city overflowing with
pleasures.
Perhaps the key fact of <LOCATION>Antwerp</LOCATION>'s history is that as capital of the Spanish
Netherlands, it was held for Catholicism. Any visit should therefore start
at <PERSON>Onze Lieve Vrouwe</PERSON>, the largest Gothic cathedral in the Low Countries. It
has been under restoration for decades, but <LOCATION>Antwerp</LOCATION> 93 speeded the programme
up.
The entire interior is again visible, with <PERSON>Rubens</PERSON>'s three wonderful
altarpieces, cleaned and conserved, displayed at the east end. From <DATE>May 26</DATE>
to <DATE>October 3</DATE>, the cathedral has an exhibition, <LOCATION>Antwerp</LOCATION> Altarpieces, the type
of 15th- and 16th-century pieces shipped out in staggering quantities for
churches from <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>South America</LOCATION>.
Any civilised visit to <LOCATION>Antwerp</LOCATION> must be partly about getting to know Rubens
better. An unusual exhibition at the Rubenshuis will shed light on the
running of the many highly successful artists' 'factories' of the day.
Rubens Cantoor (which means 'workroom') shows 80 copies of drawings by
Rubens loaned from <LOCATION>Copenhagen</LOCATION>. Most were made by <PERSON>Willem Panneels</PERSON>, who was
put in charge of the studio between <DATE>1628</DATE> and <DATE>1630</DATE> while the master was in
<LOCATION>England</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> (<DATE>May 15</DATE> to <DATE>June 27</DATE>).
So intimate is the view of the artist conveyed by the famous Rubenshuis that
you will surely want to round things off with a visit to the Rockoxhuis, the
sumptuous Renaissance mansion which was home to <PERSON>Burgomaster Nicolaas Rockox</PERSON>,
<PERSON>Rubens</PERSON>'s friend and patron. And of course, a pilgrimage is required to <LOCATION>St
Jacobskerk</LOCATION>. Above the wonderfully elegant tomb of the lord of <PERSON>Steen</PERSON> is his
last masterpiece, The <ORGANIZATION>Madonna</ORGANIZATION> with Saints.
<PERSON>Jacob Jordaens</PERSON> at the Museum of Fine Arts (27 March-27 <DATE>June 27</DATE>) is the
flagship exhibition of Antwerpen 93, celebrating 400 years since the
artist's birth. When gout carried Rubens off in <DATE>1640</DATE>, <PERSON>Jordaens</PERSON> immediately
put up his prices. Over the next four decades of this artist's long career,
the <PERSON>Jordaens</PERSON> studio continued to be hugely successful even though its
master's talent declined as <ORGANIZATION>Rubens</ORGANIZATION>'s never had. This should be the year and
the show to reevaluate <PERSON>Jordaens</PERSON>'s achievement.
Antwerp: Story of a Metropolis at the Hessenhuis is a major exhibition
mounted by historian Jan van Stock to examine the image and the reality of
<LOCATION>Antwerp</LOCATION>'s two first Golden Ages, in the <DATE>16th century</DATE> and again in the <DATE>early
17th century</DATE>. Pride of the city throughout that period was the famous
printing dynasty of the Plantins. It is not only bibliophiles who find the
Museum Plantin-Moretus a place of rare fascination. So long as you are
prepared to peer, books, prints, letters and bills bring the political and
intellectual world of these centuries vividly to life.
Here, too, are portraits by <PERSON>Rubens</PERSON>, an intimate friend of the great
<PERSON>Balthasar Moretus</PERSON>. The Plantin-Moretus marks Antwerpen 93 by looking at the
scientific side of the humanist culture so important to <PERSON>Rubens</PERSON> and his
circle. Botany in the <LOCATION>Southern Netherlands</LOCATION> (13 March-June 13) comemmorates
the studies of the three great Flemish botanists, <PERSON>Dodoens</PERSON>, <PERSON>Clusius</PERSON> and
Lobelius, whose illustrated treatises were all published by the Moretus
presses.
Although its role in the Festival programme is small, the Museum <PERSON>Mayer</PERSON> van
den Bergh cannot be missed, for it is one of the most remarkable
19th-century museums in the world. Mayer Van den <ORGANIZATION>Bergh</ORGANIZATION> was a wealthy
connoisseur and art-collector. He never married - the story goes that he was
always looking for a girl with the face of a late-Gothic <ORGANIZATION>Virgin Mary</ORGANIZATION>.
Van den Bergh died in his early thirties. In <DATE>1904</DATE>, his mother built the
exquisite neo-Renaissance mansion with its intimate rooms. Original cases
still house manuscripts, Byzantine and early medieval ivories, 12th-century
sculpture, coins and a fine collection of Nethelandish and Flemish
paintings. Few art-lovers realise that <PERSON>Breughel</PERSON>'s chilling '<PERSON>Dulle Griet</PERSON>' is
hidden away in the <PERSON>Mayer</PERSON> van den Bergh with his 'Twelve Proverbs', two of
only seven of the artist's works remaining in <LOCATION>Belgium</LOCATION>.
Diamonds enter the festival in <ORGANIZATION>Diamond Jewellery</ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION>Antwerp</LOCATION>'s Golden Age
(<DATE>April 23-September 26</DATE>). At the city's distinguished <ORGANIZATION>Ethnographic Museum</ORGANIZATION>,
there will be The Face of the Spirits: Masks from <LOCATION>Zaire</LOCATION> (<DATE>September
19-December 31</DATE>). The contemporary art programme has not been finalised but
<DATE>summer</DATE> will see openings at the Middelheim Open-air Sculpture Museum, the
Museum for Fine Arts, and the <ORGANIZATION>Museum of Contemporary</ORGANIZATION> Art.
A marvellous guide-book for exploring <LOCATION>Antwerp</LOCATION> is <PERSON>Derek Blyth</PERSON>'s Flemish
Cities Explored (<ORGANIZATION>Bodley Head</ORGANIZATION>, <DATE>1990</DATE>). It would be nice if in <LOCATION>Antwerp</LOCATION>'s great
year of culture, every one of the chapels, mansions and gardens therein
recommended might indeed be accessible.

<FP=106> [<PERSON>Herbert Kremp</PERSON> commentary: "<LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> Is Expanding"] </F>
  [Text] The inclusion of three Scandinavian states and 
<LOCATION>Austria</LOCATION> is changing the political and intellectual-cultural 
prospects of the <ORGANIZATION>European Union</ORGANIZATION> [<ORGANIZATION>EU</ORGANIZATION>]. The imbalance toward the 
south is disappearing and, with the accession of the north and 
the east, the touch of Carolingian stuffiness is waning. Since 
countries with tested national sovereignty are involved in the 
further decisions, the form of a federation of states, of 
cooperation of national states and their parliaments, is 
beginning to dominate. 
  The old-established members of the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> scene in <LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION> have 
long predicted this development with regret, and they are not 
wrong: With the geographic and mental expansion, the political 
"deepening" of the <ORGANIZATION>Union</ORGANIZATION> becomes a rhetorical postulate without 
any prospect for realization. At least the Scandinavians do not 
have any inclination toward integration in the form of a federal 
state. We are facing the end of the late romantic period. 
  With <LOCATION>Finland</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Union</ORGANIZATION> gets 1,300 km of Russian border and 
the proximity of the Baltic states -- with all the flair and all 
the risk. In the case of <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Norway</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Austria</LOCATION>, the 
single market, that is, the real economic and trade policy 
advantage of the community, has the greatest attractiveness. 
However, particularly <LOCATION>Finland</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION> hope for an increase 
in security, at least in political support. With <LOCATION>Austria</LOCATION>, the 
German language section of the <ORGANIZATION>EU</ORGANIZATION> is growing. However, more 
important is its function as a bridge to <LOCATION>Hungary</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Slovenia</LOCATION>, and 
<LOCATION>Croatia</LOCATION>. Here, too, the <ORGANIZATION>Union</ORGANIZATION>, which has so far been oriented 
toward <LOCATION>West Europe</LOCATION>, is going to receive a fruitful closeness to 
the <LOCATION>East</LOCATION>. 
  Until the date of accession at the upcoming turn of the 
year, 
several obstacles -- both in substance and in terms of 
referendums -- have to be overcome. These apply mainly to 
<LOCATION>Norway</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Austria</LOCATION>. In both countries the result of the 
referendums is uncertain; in <LOCATION>Finland</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION> it is considered 
relatively certain. <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> has pushed the membership 
negotiations forward with great energy. As a result, It is 
natural and unavoidable that it has not gained just friends in 
the old <ORGANIZATION>European Community</ORGANIZATION>.

<HL> LEISURE &amp; ARTS -- Art Crime Update:
@  Art for America's Sake
@  ----
@  By Constance Lowenthal </HL>
<DD> 07/26/89 </DD>
<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) </SO>
<TEXT>
   Unlike many Western nations that are rich in art, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> has no laws limiting the export of cultural treasures. 
<LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Great Britain</LOCATION> all have laws to screen major works of art before export, and American buyers have often chafed at restrictions that delayed or undid their purchases. 
However, in anticipation of the <DATE>May 31</DATE> sale of the <PERSON>Stillman Pontormo</PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION>Christie's</ORGANIZATION>, many Americans began to think for the first time that such restrictions might be a good idea here. 
Although privately owned, this great Italian mannerist portrait had been on loan to American museums for decades. 
The successful bid by the <ORGANIZATION>J. Paul Getty Museum</ORGANIZATION> brought a collective sigh of relief and blunted the edge of those worries: The painting will stay in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>. 
But the problem will not go away. 

   Discussions are just beginning to get serious about whether American painting, sculpture, decorative arts and the art of native Americans should be kept at home. 
On <DATE>June 20</DATE>, at the convention of the <ORGANIZATION>American Association of Museums</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New Orleans</LOCATION>, the committee on museology unanimously passed a resolution drafted by <PERSON>Paul N. Perrot</PERSON>, director of the <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> Museum of Fine Arts, recommending that the museum community study the question and present recommendations to the relevant governmental authorities. 
Without restrictions on the export of cultural property, market forces play freely, not only for Rembrandts and van Goghs, but also for home-grown American art, artifacts and documents that speak to our history.

   Although the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> has no strategy for keeping American heritage at home, our policy of helping other countries protect their cultural heritage is much stronger. 
In <DATE>1970</DATE>, when archaeological plunder was endemic in the jungles of <LOCATION>Central America</LOCATION> as well as the mountains of <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> Minor and Etruria, <ORGANIZATION>Unesco</ORGANIZATION> adopted its "Convention on the Means of Prohibiting the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property." 
More than 60 nations are now signatories, but the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> is the only one among them that could be described as an art importer. 
<LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Switzerland</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> are not parties to the convention. 
The <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Senate</ORGANIZATION> ratified the convention in <DATE>1972</DATE>, but it was only in <DATE>1983</DATE> that <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> enacted enabling legislation, passing a bill that was a compromise between archaeological and commercial interests. 

   In accord with that law, the Cultural Property Implementation Act of <DATE>1983</DATE>, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> recently banned the importation of a type of Bolivian textile essential to religious and social ceremonies of the Aymara culture. 
The textiles in question are made from alpaca and vicuna wool in <LOCATION>Coroma</LOCATION>, a town high in the Bolivian Andes, and have been woven in the same manner since before the advent of the Inca or the Spaniard. 
The textiles have a silken luster, and enough had found their way to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> for the <ORGANIZATION>Smithsonian</ORGANIZATION> to organize a traveling exhibition, "Aymara Weavings: Ceremonial Textiles of Colonial and 19th-Century <LOCATION>Bolivia</LOCATION>," in <DATE>1983</DATE>. 
This in spite of export restrictions enacted by <LOCATION>Bolivia</LOCATION> in <DATE>1961</DATE>. 

   <LOCATION>Bolivia</LOCATION> submitted a formal request to President <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> to ban the import of these textiles, saying that the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> has been a major market for the weavings. 
<LOCATION>Bolivia</LOCATION> estimated that about half its sacred textiles had been smuggled out of <LOCATION>Bolivia</LOCATION> and found their way into American collections. 
The request was reviewed, following the provisions of the legislation, by the <ORGANIZATION>Cultural Property Advisory Committee</ORGANIZATION>, a group of 11 archaeologists, dealers, private citizens and representatives of the museum community. 
The committee found that the loss created an emergency situation for the Aymara culture and recommended a five-year ban that went into effect on <DATE>March 14, 1989</DATE>. 
Customs is the agency charged with enforcing the ban. 
This is the second ban recommended by the committee; the first, in <DATE>1987</DATE>, was to restrict the importation of pre-Hispanic material from <LOCATION>El Salvador</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Cara Sucia</LOCATION> region.

   With the arrest in <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> of a former commissioner in the Buenos Aires police department, the stage was set for the recovery of old master paintings stolen in <DATE>1983</DATE> and <DATE>1987</DATE> from two museums in <LOCATION>Rosario</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>. 
<PERSON>Juan Carlos Longo</PERSON>, 53 years old, and his common-law wife, <PERSON>Hilda Arias Longo</PERSON>, 40, were arrested after selling one of the stolen pictures, "Doves and Hens," attributed to <ORGANIZATION>Francisco Goya</ORGANIZATION>, to an undercover <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> agent. 
Special Agent <PERSON>James D. Keith</PERSON> of the <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> called <ORGANIZATION>IFAR</ORGANIZATION> to confirm that this picture and others that <PERSON>Mr. Longo</PERSON> said were available were in fact stolen. 
After the sting and the arrests, the couple was extradited to <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>, where <ORGANIZATION>Interpol</ORGANIZATION> continued the investigation and, in short order, arrested six other individuals and recovered a second work, "Portrait of Philip II," by <PERSON>Alonso Sanchez Coello</PERSON>, a Spanish 16th-century court painter. 

   ---

   <PERSON>Rodin</PERSON>'s "Mask of a Man With a Broken Nose" has been safely returned to the <LOCATION>Rodin Museum</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION>, where it was stolen at gunpoint <DATE>last November</DATE>. 
An anonymous tip led the authorities to 24-year-old <PERSON>Stephen Shih</PERSON>, an unemployed truck driver, described by neighbors as "really nice," but also as "eccentric, peculiar and odd." 
<PERSON>Mr. Shih</PERSON> was charged with robbery, theft, receiving stolen goods, unlawful restraint and weapons offenses. 
If convicted, he faces a possible 40 years in prison. 
The police had to find the bronze without his help, however, and searches in and around the garage over which he lived were frustrating. 
Eventually, they found "Mask" well-wrapped and hidden in the basement of an apartment building owned by the accused's mother. 
Police and museum officials were jubilant at the happy ending, a rarity in art-theft annals, where the recovery rate hovers around <PERCENT>12%</PERCENT>.

ART: LACMA'S 'TREASURES FROM THE FITZWILLIAM,' TAKEN FROM THE MUSEUM AT 
CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY, ILLUSTRATES THE MARCH OF ART THROUGH THE CENTURIES.

Titian, <PERSON>Rubens</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Rembrandt</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Hogarth</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Delacroix</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Degas</LOCATION> -- given the list of 
stellar names from the pantheon in <LOCATION>Western</LOCATION> art history, it might seem odd to 
choose <PERSON>Francois-Xavier Fabre</PERSON> as the artist to represent the highly engaging 
exhibition, "Treasures From the <LOCATION>Fitzwilliam</LOCATION> Museum: The Increase of Learning 
and other great Objects of that <ORGANIZATION>Noble Foundation</ORGANIZATION>." 
</P>
<P>
But that's just what its organizers did. Through the reproduction of a Fabre 
portrait on the covers of both the catalogue and the press kit, and with pride 
of place for the painting in the gallery installation, the show -- which opened 
<DATE>Thursday</DATE> at the <LOCATION>Los Angeles County</LOCATION> Museum of Art (to <DATE>Sept. 9</DATE>) -- surprisingly 
features a relatively obscure artist as its metaphoric poster boy. 
</P>
<P>
The choice might be surprising, but it also turns out to be appropriate. The 
reason is that the <LOCATION>Fitzwilliam</LOCATION>, the first great university museum ever, has 
more on its mind than merely toting up celebrated names. 
</P>
<P>
The museum was established in <DATE>1816</DATE> by <PERSON>Richard</PERSON>, seventh <PERSON>Viscount Fitzwilliam</PERSON> of 
<LOCATION>Merrion</LOCATION>, with a bequest to <ORGANIZATION>Cambridge University</ORGANIZATION> of his art collections and 
library, and a sum of money to care for both. (A sweet portrait of 19-year-old 
<PERSON>Richard</PERSON>, by the often eccentric <PERSON>Joseph Wright</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Derby</LOCATION>, hangs in the show.) The 
aim, according to the bequest, was to promote "the Increase of Learning and 
other great Objects of that <ORGANIZATION>Noble Foundation</ORGANIZATION>." The selection at <ORGANIZATION>LACMA</ORGANIZATION>, which 
numbers more than 160 items, suggests the diversity and scope of that intent. 
</P>
<P>
The earliest object is a delicate, incised drawing of a reindeer on a small, 
thin shard of limestone, dating from the Paleolithic period (about 12000 BC). 
The latest is also a drawing -- a <DATE>1918</DATE> pencil study of an actress wearing a 
large hat, by <PERSON>Amadeo Modigliani</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
In between are Asian, <ORGANIZATION>Middle Eastern</ORGANIZATION> and, mostly, European decorative arts, 
paintings, sculptures, coins, prints and many more drawings. Not everything is 
first-rate. The graceful Paleolithic reindeer may be regarded as among the 
finest examples of naturalistic art to have survived the ages, but the 
<PERSON>Modigliani</PERSON> is at best indifferent. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the celebrated names can't always be counted on to deliver celebrated 
works. <PERSON>Antoine Watteau</PERSON>'s delicate chalk study of a man playing a flute falls 
apart in the crude rendering of the hands, while the <ORGANIZATION>Renoir</ORGANIZATION> painting of a 
street scene is, typically, a chromatic mess (the otherwise sensible catalogue 
wildly claims that it compares to "Luncheon of the <ORGANIZATION>Boating Party</ORGANIZATION>," far and away 
<ORGANIZATION>Renoir</ORGANIZATION>'s finest painting). In the museum's historical chain, the 19th-Century 
holdings constitute the weakest link, forming a perfunctory coda to the 
exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
But individual excellence is not the only reason a museum -- especially a 
university museum -- assembles a collection. The Watteau drawing claims 
historical significance, serving as the model for figures in more than one 
painting by this important artist, while the <ORGANIZATION>Renoir</ORGANIZATION> is in part instructive 
simply because it dates from the same period as his great boating picture. As 
for the <DATE>19th-Century</DATE> slump, it suggests the difficulty in making sense of 
contemporaneous, as opposed to historical, artistic events -- a difficulty 
common to any number of museums. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the gold far outweighs the dross in the galleries. The hard, jewel-like 
color of <PERSON>Bassano</PERSON>'s early mannerist "Journey to Calvary" (circa 1540) gets my 
wholly arbitrary vote for Best of Show, while the furiously flailing limbs of 
<ORGANIZATION>Titian</ORGANIZATION>'s monumental image of rape, "Tarquin and Lucretia" (1568-71), create a 
disturbing dramatic spectacle. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, <PERSON>Peter Paul Rubens</PERSON>' small oil on copper, "The Death of Hippolytus" 
(circa 1611), is as startlingly fresh as if it had been painted last week. 
<PERSON>Carlo Dolci</PERSON>'s 17th-Century portrait of a contemplative scholar -- a fitting 
subject for a museum at <LOCATION>Cambridge</LOCATION> -- carries what is surely the most 
beautifully painted shirt collar ever: Like frosted glass, the translucent 
cloth creates a dazzling shadow play for the silver cloak tassel it conceals. 
</P>
<P>
The five medieval manuscripts and the many small bronzes -- especially an 
astonishing 2nd-Century BC figure of a drunken Hercules, which is believed to 
have been broken off the shoulder of a vessel -- are almost uniformly fine. And 
for those whose sensibilities are easily offended, here's a friendly warning: 
Avoid at all costs <PERSON>William Hogarth</PERSON>'s delightful pair of paintings, "Before" and 
"After." They're raucously engaging images of a courtly lad and lass, but the 
bracketed event in question would doubtless make <PERSON>Jesse Helms</PERSON> apoplectic. 
</P>
<P>
The sensitively installed show is slightly marred by an annoying glare in the 
main gallery, which makes unobstructed viewing of the large <ORGANIZATION>Titian</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Van Dyck</PERSON>, 
<PERSON>Guercino</PERSON> and <PERSON>Salvator Rosa</PERSON> difficult at best. (A makeshift space, carved from 
the well of the <ORGANIZATION>Ahmanson Building</ORGANIZATION>'s atrium, the room has no ceiling to support 
adequate lighting.) Still, "Treasures of the <LOCATION>Fitzwilliam</LOCATION>" demonstrates 
something pivotal about the foundations of the modern era, something its 
"poster boy" makes plain. 
</P>
<P>
Francois-Xavier <PERSON>Fabre</PERSON> was a fashionable and successful painter of the late 18th 
and early 19th centuries. A student of the great neo-classical master, 
<PERSON>Jacques-Louis David</PERSON>, he won the requisite prize for any aspiring French artist 
-- the Premier Grand Prix de <LOCATION>Rome</LOCATION> -- and promptly left for <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>. He meant to 
insert himself as the inevitable destination for the on-going march of history 
and civilization: Imperial <LOCATION>Rome</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Renaissance Italy</LOCATION> to the neo-classical turn 
of the <DATE>19th Century</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Fabre's aristocratic portrait of a gentleman, "<PERSON>Allen Smith</PERSON> Seated Above the 
Arno, Contemplating Florence" (1797) is about as straightforward a declaration 
of this path of ascent as could be imagined. The actual identity of the sitter 
has long been in dispute (recent speculation is that he was American, not 
British), but clearly this tourist was a man of means. The picture's 
composition derives from a famous portrait of <ORGANIZATION>Goethe</ORGANIZATION>, with a notable 
difference: <PERSON>Smith</PERSON>'s head, formally posed as a refined profile, is reminiscent 
of an ancient cameo. He is seated on a crude block of stone decorated with 
Egyptian hieroglyphs, a ruined Corinthian capital at his feet and the 
Renaissance city <LOCATION>Florence</LOCATION> spread out before his steady gaze. 
</P>
<P>
Dressed in period clothes and powdered wig, <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> is also wrapped in a tunic 
that approximates a Greek chiton or a Roman toga. The loping arches of a bridge 
that spans the Arno form a rhythmic procession leading gently to the graceful 
curve of the sitter's hand -- a sitter who has thus been deftly cast by <PERSON>Fabre</PERSON> 
as a living bridge to the classical past. 
</P>
<P>
Although acquired by the <LOCATION>Fitzwilliam</LOCATION> only in this century, the painting's <DATE>1797</DATE> 
date is roughly coincident with the university museum's <DATE>1816</DATE> founding. The 
impulse that fueled one also fueled the other. It's easy to see the 
appropriateness of <PERSON>Mr. Smith</PERSON> as "poster boy" for this illuminating exhibition.

THE TIMES SHOPPER: EUROPEAN ART FAIR IS FINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

MAASTRICHT, Netherlands 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Plan ahead for the annual European Fine Art Fair -- the world's biggest 
exhibition and sale of antique paintings, prints, maps, furniture, objets 
d'art, jewelry, rugs and tapestries. 
</P>
<P>
The fair will be held <DATE>March 10-18</DATE> at the new Maastricht Exhibition and <ORGANIZATION>Congress 
Center</ORGANIZATION>. Maastricht, the oldest city in the <LOCATION>Netherlands</LOCATION>, with cobblestone 
streets and beautiful historic buildings, is in the province of <LOCATION>Limburg</LOCATION>, near 
the point at which the borders of the <LOCATION>Netherlands</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Belgium</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION> 
intersect. 
</P>
<P>
The fair brings together more than 100 of the world's finest art and antique 
dealers from the <LOCATION>Netherlands</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Great Britain</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Austria</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Belgium</LOCATION>, 
<LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Switzerland</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
This year's roster includes <ORGANIZATION>Richard Green</ORGANIZATION> (<LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, paintings), <PERSON>Eskanazi</PERSON> (<LOCATION>Milan</LOCATION>, 
carpets), <PERSON>Robert Hall</PERSON> (<LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, snuff bottles), <PERSON>Johnny Van Haeften</PERSON> (<LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, 
Dutch and <ORGANIZATION>Flemish Old Masters</ORGANIZATION>), <PERSON>Newhouse Galleries</PERSON> (<LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION>, paintings), 
<ORGANIZATION>Vanderven &amp; Vanderven</ORGANIZATION> (<LOCATION>Netherlands</LOCATION>, oriental porcelains) and Silber-Keller 
(<LOCATION>Munich</LOCATION>, silver, art nouveau, art deco). Participation is by invitation only. 
</P>
<P>
More than 30,000 people are expected. They include curators from major museums 
plus private collectors, as well as lesser dealers and novices. 
</P>
<P>
Everything on exhibit is for sale. Prices are from <MONEY>several thousand dollars</MONEY> to 
<MONEY>several hundreds of thousands of dollars</MONEY>, but, regardless of the price, each 
piece must be considered "important" to be shown. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the exhibition is carefully scrutinized by a vetting committee. The 
committee not only verifies authenticity, but screens each piece to make sure 
it is rare and in good enough condition to be included at the fair. 
</P>
<P>
Items that have been overly restored are not accepted. Nor are pieces of 
furniture that have been "married," i.e., the legs from a table with a damaged 
top have been removed and put on a different table top with damaged legs. 
</P>
<P>
The vetting committee's seal of approval is placed on every item, and copies 
are kept in the fair's office. 
</P>
<P>
Prices are fixed. Many of the tags on items are high, but they are based on 
genuine market value. 
</P>
<P>
Walking into the fair is like entering a museum. Only there is no glass 
encasement between you and the objets d'art. You can actually pick up an 
11th-Century Cambodian bronze statue of the <ORGANIZATION>Hindu God Vishnu</ORGANIZATION> or a Delftware 
platter made in the <DATE>17th Century</DATE> and examine it at close range. 
</P>
<P>
No one will stop you from running your fingers over a 16th-Century, <LOCATION>Flemish</LOCATION>, 
wool-and-silk tapestry of an idyllic wooden landscape. You are invited to slip 
the brilliantly glittering diamond and ruby bracelet that once belonged to a 
French queen onto your wrist. You may sit down to rest on a late 16th-Century 
Chinese huang hua-li yokeback armchair. 
</P>
<P>
Most of these items have come from private collections and will go into private 
collections. The fair is the only time that they will be on public display. 
</P>
<P>
The vast interior of the exhibition hall will be transformed into a series of 
small galleries occupied by individual exhibitors. Some of the compartments are 
decorated like opulent rooms, others are more gallery-like. 
</P>
<P>
The diverse range of arts and antiquities will be presented in four sections, 
which makes viewing that much easier. 
</P>
<P>
The Pictura Section covers, from the Old Masters to Impressionists and early 
20th Century. The Contemporary Section includes post-1960 paintings and 
sculpture. 
</P>
<P>
The Antiquaires Section offers European and Oriental furniture, bronzes, 
clocks, porcelain and glass, arms and armor, silver and jewelry, books and 
manuscripts. The Textura Section has textiles, carpets and tapestries, both 
European and Oriental. 
</P>
<P>
The catalogue for the fair will be available only at the fair. 
</P>
<P>
The piece de resistance at last year's fair was a beautiful Charles X French 
rosewood billiard table inlaid with citron wood, sold by <PERSON>Philippe Dufrasne</PERSON> of 
<LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION>. Its price was only revealed to prospective buyers, and was not listed 
on the fair's registry of sales. 
</P>
<P>
There were also gem-encrusted reliquaries from the <DATE>13th Century</DATE>, a set of five 
18th-Century Dutch glass paintings depicting members of the <ORGANIZATION>House of Orange</ORGANIZATION>, 
and a 17th-Century Flemish cabinet of ebony and stained fruitwood covered with 
paintings of landscapes. A set of stag's antlers (German)engraved with "The 
Wise and Foolish Virgins," dated <DATE>1563</DATE>, was once in the <ORGANIZATION>William Randolph Hearst</ORGANIZATION> 
collection. 
</P>
<P>
Items on last year's listing of sales included a <PERSON>Peter Paul Rubens</PERSON> (1557-1638) 
portrait of a bearded man, which sold for <MONEY>$850,000</MONEY> to a Swedish collector. A 
<PERSON>Paulus Moreelse</PERSON> (1571-1638) painting of Pan playing his pipes sold for about 
<MONEY>$104,000</MONEY>, while a <ORGANIZATION>Salomon</ORGANIZATION> van Ruysdael (1628-1682) river landscape cost about 
<MONEY>$700,000</MONEY>. 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Peabody Museum</ORGANIZATION> purchased a <DATE>1717</DATE> Chinese export plaster figure of an 
unknown gentleman and a rare 18th-Century Chinese blanc de chine group of a 
foreigner riding on a liondog -- both for undisclosed sums. 
</P>
<P>
A pair of 18th-Century Arita porcelain vases and covers cost <MONEY>$14,980</MONEY>, but an 
exquisite <LOCATION>Galle</LOCATION> vase, dated <DATE>1900</DATE>, decorated with a landscape in blue and yellow 
brought <MONEY>$3,088</MONEY>. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Abraham Louis Breguet</PERSON>'s extraordinary traveling clock, made in <DATE>1817</DATE> and still 
ticking, was sold for <MONEY>$54,108</MONEY>. Two ornate golden bracelets set with pink topaz, 
emeralds and diamonds, made in <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> in <DATE>1835</DATE>, cost <MONEY>$23,000</MONEY>, while a pair of 
fer de <LOCATION>Berlin</LOCATION> earrings, dated 1840, sold for about <MONEY>$1,500</MONEY>. 
</P>
<P>
Contemporary art that was purchased at the fair last year included an <PERSON>Andy 
Warhol</PERSON> portrait of <PERSON>Marlene Deitrich</PERSON> (<DATE>1962</DATE>, gouache and graphite on paper) for 
about <MONEY>$54,108</MONEY>, and "Beuys by Warhol," a silk screen and diamond point done in 
<DATE>1960</DATE> for about <MONEY>$11,723</MONEY>. 
</P>
<P>
A <DATE>1972</DATE> untitled <PERSON>Willem de Kooning</PERSON> oil on newspaper, mounted on canvas, sold to 
a Swedish collector for about <MONEY>$67,635</MONEY>, and <PERSON>Sam Francis</PERSON>' "Triangle," dated <DATE>1975</DATE>, 
was bought by a Belgian collector for <MONEY>$29,308</MONEY>. 
</P>
<P>
This year the fair will present a series of 12 lectures by specialists. 
Speakers include curators from <LOCATION>Amsterdam</LOCATION>'s Rijksmuseum, <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>'s Museum of Fine 
Arts and <LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION>' <ORGANIZATION>Royal Museum</ORGANIZATION> of Art and History. 
</P>
<P>
There will also be a program of concerts and recitals, including performances 
by the <ORGANIZATION>Moscow Ballet Ensemble</ORGANIZATION>, soprano <PERSON>Helen Lawrence</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Amsterdam</LOCATION>'s Kamer 
Orkest. Maastricht's historic buildings are used as venues. 
</P>
<P>
The fair offers a gala first-night viewing and banquet. Tickets are about <MONEY>$50</MONEY> 
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, including the catalogue. Fair hours are <DATE>Saturday</DATE> and <DATE>Sunday</DATE> from <TIME>11 a.m. 
to 6 p.m.</TIME>, <DATE>Friday</DATE> from noon to <TIME>9 p.m.</TIME> Admission is about <MONEY>$14</MONEY>, including the

<TEXT>
Now to get back to a subject I would have tackled in the past couple of
weeks except for other matters intervening. I shall not allow the week's
dreary round of comment on the British Budget to deflect me.
Last month, the 75th anniversary of almost everything was celebrated,
including the foundation of the Austrian republic. Never has this <DATE>November</DATE>
date seemed so relevant to current events, at least to the Austrian press.
The significance of the collapse of the empire was summarised in the
biggest-selling tabloid, Kurier. It noted that the monarchy's multi-racial
army occupied huge tracts of foreign soil by late-1918 and, 'in a typical
piece of Austrian nonsense,' surrendered in <LOCATION>Padua</LOCATION> to an Italian army it had
already beaten soundly.
We are still dealing with the consequences of the subsequent collapse:
Czechs and Slovaks pushed into a common state; millions of Hungarians left
as minorities and as potential problems for <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Serbia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Slovakia</LOCATION>;
and Slovenes and Croats locked into a south Slav state where the Serbs
played the role of victor.
In <LOCATION>Bosnia</LOCATION>, there began a wave of persecution of those Moslems and Croats who
had been loyal to the monarchy. <LOCATION>Austria</LOCATION> lost <LOCATION>South Tyrol</LOCATION> and became 'the
state nobody wanted'; all the natives did want was union with <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>, so
the <ORGANIZATION>Nazis</ORGANIZATION> entered the country <DATE>20 years later</DATE> under the pretext of
'expressing the true will of Austrians.'
Kurier concluded that the end of the empire was the 'beginning of an endless
tragedy of ethnic and national conflicts in <LOCATION>central Europe</LOCATION>.'
Die Presse adopted a complementary theme: in a modern <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> free of trade
restrictions, with open frontiers and possessed of a single currency, there
was only one historical precedent that mattered. The Habsburgs had provided
all this for a large part of the continent until <DATE>1918</DATE>.
In the <ORGANIZATION>Salzburger Nachrichten</ORGANIZATION>, we read that the real anniversary was that of
1,000 years of <LOCATION>Austria</LOCATION>, which falls in <DATE>1996</DATE> - the year it plans to enter the
<LOCATION>European Union</LOCATION>. That, said a contributor to the paper, meant the country
would sacrifice a 'thousand million schillings' and 1,000 years of history
while receiving Ecus in exchange.
So, if <LOCATION>Austria</LOCATION> was at the centre of the storm which generated all the
European disasters of this century, it also provides the metaphor for a full
European union, for which it will sacrifice itself yet again.
The Dual Monarchy should indeed influence those in <LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION> who are creating
a more boring <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>. The Austro-Hungarian model can add a dash of colour
and satisfy Euro-sceptics of different hues.
If <PERSON>Jacques Delors</PERSON> were to become, say, the Count of <LOCATION>Brabant</LOCATION>, he would appear
an even more attractive figure to the diverse populations of the <ORGANIZATION>Union</ORGANIZATION>. (The
title might carry with it the captaincy-general of the Belgian football
team).
Articles in <LOCATION>Hello</LOCATION>, and long-distance shots in the seedier <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> tabloids of
his wife on distant island beaches, would elevate this somewhat forbidding
figure to celebrity status.
He would be assisted by various new commissioners - the <ORGANIZATION>Duke of Connaught</ORGANIZATION>
would be the hereditary Commissioner for Peasants and <PERSON>Gentry</PERSON>, and the <ORGANIZATION>Duke
of Burgundy</ORGANIZATION> would make a fine food and drink supremo. A resurrected
Elector-Palatine would be president of the <ORGANIZATION>European Parliament</ORGANIZATION>, members of
which he would select personally.
By its very nature, the system would ensure the realisation of certain
socialist aspirations - a 'Europe of regions' would be an inevitable result.
Work sharing and jobs for life are at the core of the concept.
The post of head of state would pose some problems, though. Many would think
twice about a European emperor based in <LOCATION>Vienna</LOCATION>; but turning <PERSON>Otto von
Habsburg</PERSON> into a Carolingian figurehead enthroned in an already existing
European institutional capital, <LOCATION>Strasbourg</LOCATION>, would provide a decorative
addition to the scene. The Queen of <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>, as the first among equals of
European royalty, would supply the balance in the other half of a <ORGANIZATION>Dual
Monarchy</ORGANIZATION>.
And, finally, we should have a solution for the German problem. The
country's unification has not proved beneficial - it never has - so the
answer is to split it up again.
The old German Democratic Republic could re-emerge in slightly different
form as <LOCATION>Prussia</LOCATION>; <LOCATION>Bavaria</LOCATION> could gain what it always wanted - independence of
a sort; and <LOCATION>Hamburg</LOCATION> would concentrate on making money around the Baltic and
up and down the Elbe. Any number of daft and varied constitutions could be
provided to ensure that subsidiarity flourished.
To conclude with what might be an apocryphal tale, but one which has the
ring of truth: in <DATE>1920</DATE>, a German weekly, presumably Simplicissimus, ran a
competition for the most startling headline of all time. The winner was:
'Archduke Franz Ferdinand Alive: Great War a Mistake.'
The time has come to rectify that mistake.

PRAYER BOOKS -- THE FIRST AFFORDABLE ART FOR THE 13TH-CENTURY MIDDLE CLASS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Until the late Middle Ages, art in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> was something that belonged to the 
rich and powerful. Royalty, high-ranking church officials and estate owners 
were the only ones who could afford to commission the spectacular paintings and 
reliefs now associated with that time. 
</P>
<P>
But sometime about the <ORGANIZATION>13th Century</ORGANIZATION>, middle-class people in great numbers 
started to bring what is now considered high art into their homes. Only they 
didn't call them works of art; they were prayer books. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the first affordable art," said <PERSON>Jennifer Haley</PERSON>, curator of the 
"Illuminated Devotional Manuscripts" exhibition that opened last week at the <ORGANIZATION>J. 
Paul Getty Museum</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Malibu</LOCATION>. The exhibit of 20 prayer books handmade for home 
or monastery use will continue through the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
The books are spectacularly decorated with vividly colored designs and graphic 
illustrations of biblical or moral tales. 
</P>
<P>
"The books were made and bought for religious purposes," <PERSON>Haley</PERSON> said, "but they 
broadened people's lives in a lot of ways. You could even say that they were 
sort of status symbols." 
</P>
<P>
The earliest book in the exhibition is a 12th-Century monk's text, called a 
breviary, from the Benedictine monastery in <LOCATION>Monte Cassino</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>. The 
calligraphy in the book, done by a scribe named Sigenulfus, is an artistic 
accomplishment in itself. But the chief artistic attraction of this volume that 
was a precursor to home prayer books is its fancifully decorated letters of the 
alphabet. 
</P>
<P>
As displayed at the museum, the book is opened to a frenzied, fanciful 
depiction of the letter C adorned with hordes of real and imagined animals and 
masses of interlaced vines. It is what a future generation would call 
psychedelic. 
</P>
<P>
"It is kind of wild," said <PERSON>Thomas Kren</PERSON>, curator of manuscripts at the <ORGANIZATION>Getty 
Museum</ORGANIZATION>. "Unfortunately, we have no idea who the artist was. Most of the art in 
the books was not signed." 
</P>
<P>
The breviary, like most of the books in the exhibit, was part of a manuscript 
collection begun in the late 1950s by a German couple, <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> and <PERSON>Irene Ludwig</PERSON>. 
Their collection, which was bought by the <ORGANIZATION>Getty Museum</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1983</DATE>, was assembled 
with the aid of a famed <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> rare-bookseller, <ORGANIZATION>H.P. Kraus</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
In his autobiography, <PERSON>Kraus</PERSON> wrote that finding the breviary was one of the 
crowning achievements of his career. He first saw it in <DATE>1962</DATE>, when it was 
offered to him by a secretive Swiss book dealer, and he would have bought it on 
the spot had he not feared that the spectacular book had been recently stolen 
from its monastery home. 
</P>
<P>
Kraus traveled to the monastery in <ORGANIZATION>Monte Cassino</ORGANIZATION> to make inquiries. There, a 
kindly librarian told him what he prayed he would hear. The book, <PERSON>Kraus</PERSON> was 
told, had been missing from the monastery collection for more than a century. 
</P>
<P>
"A pity, I said, but the tears welling up in my eyes were for joy," <PERSON>Kraus</PERSON> wrote 
in his book. "Had it been missing that long, it was no longer the monastery's 
property under law and nothing stood in the way of its sale. I could buy it 
without fear." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Kraus</PERSON>, who died in <DATE>1988</DATE>, bought the breviary for <MONEY>$30,000</MONEY>, a fraction of its 
real value. <PERSON>Kren</PERSON> declined to put an exact value on the book's worth <DATE>today</DATE>, but 
said that at auction it would be likely to fetch a seven-figure price. 
</P>
<P>
The earliest books in the exhibition that were made for home use are Psalters 
from the <ORGANIZATION>13th Century</ORGANIZATION>. The illustrations in these books of Psalms were often in 
the form of a series of panels used to tell stories from the life of Christ or 
other biblical sagas. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't love the idea of comparing them to comic books, but they do tell 
stories in somewhat the same way," <PERSON>Kren</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
The books for the home market that really caught on, the Middle Ages gave way 
to the Renaissance, were known as <ORGANIZATION>Books of Hours</ORGANIZATION>. They served as guides to 
daily worship at prescribed times of day. "We found records that showed these 
books were very popular," said <PERSON>Haley</PERSON>, who worked as an intern earlier this year 
at the <ORGANIZATION>Getty Museum</ORGANIZATION>. She is now back in <LOCATION>Princeton</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>, where she is writing 
her doctoral thesis on 15th-Century manuscripts. 
</P>
<P>
"They were especially popular with women who sought to emulate princesses and 
duchesses who were known to own several prayer books," she said. 
</P>
<P>
These Books of Hours were prohibitively expensive if done by known artists of 
the time. One example in the exhibition is a spectacular book illuminated by 
Flemish artist <PERSON>Simon Benning</PERSON> in about <DATE>1530</DATE>. It was commissioned by <PERSON>Cardinal 
Albrecht</PERSON> of Brandenburg (who went down in religious history as the church 
figure <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther</ORGANIZATION> rebelled against). 
</P>
<P>
Lower-priced Books of Hours, of which there are several in the exhibition, were 
still a bit on the expensive side for the average, middle-class citizen, but 
they were within grasp. "A book like this was a special purchase," <PERSON>Haley</PERSON> said. 
"It was the kind of thing, like a car, that you would not just go out and buy. 
It was a major investment, and you'd think about it a long time before buying." 
</P>
<P>
Although the books were used for religious devotions, their owners probably 
flirted at least a bit with the sin of pride. "They were not only objects of 
use, they were also something people liked to show off," <PERSON>Haley</PERSON> said. "It was 
kind of like people with high-priced books thinking of themselves as Cadillac 
owners." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Johann Gutenberg</PERSON> and his printing press made hand-lettered and illustrated 
prayer books obsolete. Printed books were, of course, vastly less expensive and 
could be distributed far more widely. But they did lose their individuality. 
</P>
<P>
"By the late 16th Century," said <PERSON>Kren</PERSON>, gesturing toward the books in the 
exhibition, "this art form was finished." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
 The "Illuminated Devotional Manuscripts" exhibit will continue through <DATE>Dec. 30</DATE> 
at the <ORGANIZATION>J. Paul Getty Museum</ORGANIZATION>, 17985 <ORGANIZATION>Pacific Coast Highway</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Malibu</LOCATION>. Admission to 
the museum is free, but advance parking reservations are required. For 
information, call (213) 459-7611.

   Iraqi Troops Plunder Kuwait Museum

   While rampaging Iraqi soldiers in Kuwait City were looting
jewelry shops, shooting racehorses and making macabre dinners
out of rare zoo animals, some more disciplined troops from
Saddam Hussein's army made off with the treasures of the
Kuwait National Museum.
   "It is one of the most fabulous collections of Islamic art
in the world -- and it is all handpicked," said Esin Atil,
historian of Islamic Art at Washington, D.C.'s Arthur M.
Sackler Gallery.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The museum that <PERSON>Ms. Atil</PERSON> remembers -- a cultural
storehouse of some 7,000 objects from countries as far-flung
as <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>, dating from the eighth century -- no
longer exists except as a shell. On <DATE>Monday</DATE>, a representative
for the <ORGANIZATION>Kuwaiti Embassy</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> confirmed rumors of
looting that had been heard in <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> museum circles. The
condition and whereabouts of the museum's manuscripts
(including one of the oldest surviving texts of the Koran),
medieval carvings, princely textiles and precious gemstones
are unknown.
   The most detailed report to date of the sacking has been
provided by a former researcher at the museum who escaped to
<LOCATION>London</LOCATION> this month.
   "I heard reports on the 26th of <DATE>August</DATE> that the soldiers
had gotten into the museum, and decided to go and check for
myself," said the researcher, who out of concern for family
members still in <LOCATION>Kuwait</LOCATION> asked that her name be withheld.
   Under disguise, she and a friend entered the museum and
were introduced to its "new director," a uniformed Iraqi
official from the <ORGANIZATION>Ministry of Information</ORGANIZATION>. On that visit, the
museum seemed intact. But on <DATE>Sept. 4</DATE>, she saw four large
Iraqi army trucks parked outside the museum.
   "This time I couldn't get in as close . . . but there
appeared to be people in civilian {dress} and uniforms," she
said. "Subsequently, I heard from others who had been there,
that they'd seen them {the soldiers} take out cases."
   Although grateful that the museum was not summarily laid
waste -- the fate of most Kuwaiti institutions -- the
researcher said she feared for the artifacts, many of which
are centuries-old and extremely fragile. Transport across the
desert in an army truck could damage ancient objects, and the
drastic change in climate could further affect sensitive
manuscripts, wood carvings and textiles.
   Meanwhile, Iraqi officials in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> deny any
knowledge that this highly organized act of plunder took
place.
   "We don't have the slightest idea about that," said
<PERSON>Mahasin Yono</PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION>Iraqi Embassy</ORGANIZATION> representative. "We don't have
any information regarding that matter." Nor, by her account,
does her government have any official position on protecting
Kuwaiti-owned art. If, as seems likely, the methodical
plunder of the <LOCATION>Kuwait</LOCATION> collection was planned from <LOCATION>Baghdad</LOCATION>, it
amounted to a direct insult to the legacy of the recently
deposed Kuwaiti royal family.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Kuwait National Museum</ORGANIZATION> was established in <DATE>1983</DATE> by two
members of the al-Sabah family, <PERSON>Sheikh Nasser Sabah</PERSON> al-Ahmed
al-Sabah and his wife, <PERSON>Sheikha Hussa Sabah</PERSON> al-Salem al-Sabah.
Eager to create an Islamic cultural repository in their
country, the couple began collecting artifacts from all over
the world in <DATE>1975</DATE> and assembled a portion of them as a museum
with the help of <PERSON>Marilyn Jenkins</PERSON>, a curator of Islamic art at
<LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>'s Metropolitan Museum. In <DATE>1985</DATE>, the al-Sabahs
sponsored archaeological digs in <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Sheikha Hussa</PERSON> is now in <LOCATION>Switzerland</LOCATION>. Her husband's
whereabouts are unknown. And all that remains for sure of
their magnificent museum collection is a small group of
objects now bound for exhibitions in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
   More than 100 pieces from the <ORGANIZATION>Kuwait National Museum</ORGANIZATION> were
on exhibition at the <ORGANIZATION>Hermitage Museum</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Leningrad</LOCATION> during the
time of the invasion. On <DATE>Dec. 9</DATE>, they will arrive in this
country for "Islamic Art and Patronage: Selections From
<LOCATION>Kuwait</LOCATION>," at <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Walters Art Gallery</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>Ms. Atil</PERSON>, who is curator for the show, little suspected
two years ago that the objects she would select for the show
might be all that would survive of the collection. Some of
the museum's greatest treasures were left off the list
because they were "too fragile or too important," she said,
clearly regretting her earlier scruples.
   "There was one very important 14th-century luster-painted
vase that had the name of the maker as well as the patron,
that had been broken and repaired," <PERSON>Ms. Atil</PERSON> said. "I felt we
should not handle this more than necessary. There were some
marvelous intact early Islamic glass vessels that I felt were
too dangerous to include . . . We took ones that were already
broken and repaired, because if anything happened they would
break in the old place."
   However, other rare objects did make it out of <LOCATION>Kuwait</LOCATION> for
<PERSON>Ms. Atil</PERSON>'s show, among them a 10th-century astrolabe, a
10th-century marble column from a Spanish palace, late 16th-
and 17th-century Indian jewelry, and 16th- and 17th-century
Turkish rugs.
   Other treasures from the Kuwaiti museum owe their survival
to "Romance of the Taj Mahal," an exhibition at the <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION>
Museum of Fine Arts in <LOCATION>Richmond</LOCATION> through <DATE>Nov. 25</DATE> (the show
then moves to <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> Society). Although the
exhibition features just six objects from the <ORGANIZATION>Kuwait National
Museum</ORGANIZATION>, they include some of its finer examples of
17th-century Indian jewelry: a 530-carat emerald necklace, a
gold-inlaid dagger with a jewel-encrusted scabbard, and a
delicate cameo carved from onyx and rubies.
   The fate of these artifacts is as uncertain as that of
<LOCATION>Kuwait</LOCATION> itself. <PERSON>Ms. Atil</PERSON>'s exhibition, which will tour the
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> through <DATE>April 1992</DATE>, may then head on to yet unscheduled
exhibitions in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>. But the emeralds and other objects
from "Romance of the Taj Mahal" may have to stay put, thanks
to a <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> executive order that has frozen Kuwaiti
assets in this country, along with those of its occupying
power, <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION>.
   "They will come back to us for safekeeping if the
executive order has not been lifted," said <PERSON>Pamela Jenkinson</PERSON>
of the <LOCATION>Los Angeles County Museum</LOCATION>, which organized the Taj
show.
   As for the bulk of the Kuwaiti collection, the refugee art
researcher in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> is keeping her fingers crossed that
<PERSON>Saddam Hussein</PERSON> will turn out to be a good curator. "It has
taken us so long to get it together and get it to the <LOCATION>Middle
East</LOCATION>," she said. "It's sad, but we'll just have to hope."

THE RAPE OF EUROPA by <PERSON>Lynne H. Nicholas Macmillan</PERSON> Pounds 20, 498 pages
Art and war usually lie at the opposite ends of human experience, although
they meet sometimes in literature. But the fine arts presuppose peace: the
opportunity for the creation of painting and sculpture, and the repose
needed for their enjoyment, are fruits of tranquillity.
What, then, when art and war enter a different relationship, when
destructive, all-embracing modern war threatens to incinerate art galleries,
demolish cathedrals and museums, reduce statues to rubble, annihilate in
seconds the rich distillations of culture which have formed over centuries?
It is a 20th-century phenomenon that when great powers set upon each other,
everything is at risk, our lives and material treasures most of all.
One of the least known facets of the second world war is the fate suffered
by European art. In a book of brilliance <PERSON>Lynne Nicholas</PERSON> relates the period's
history from the novel perspective of what happened to <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>'s material
culture under the <ORGANIZATION>Nazis</ORGANIZATION>. She tells the tale with absorbing narrative skill,
making an extraordinary achievement of scholarship read like a thriller.
Hitler and <PERSON>Goering</PERSON> were fanatical art collectors. Whereas the latter was
fairly catholic in his tastes, the former did not have tastes - he just knew
what he liked and disliked. He liked 19th-century German paintings, and he
disliked 'degenerate art', which meant Impressionism, <LOCATION>Expressionism</LOCATION>, Cubism
 -and anything that looked distorted or 'unfinished'.
Another difference between <PERSON>Hitler</PERSON> and <PERSON>Goering</PERSON> was that whereas the latter
collected for himself, crowding his vast and vulgar palace, <PERSON>Carinhall</PERSON>, with
every sort of art, <PERSON>Hitler</PERSON> had imperial ambitions. He wished to turn his
Austrian hometown <LOCATION>Linz</LOCATION> into one of four great cultural centres of the <PERSON>Reich</PERSON>,
and the best art plundered from Jews and conquered neighbouring countries
was destined to hang there in a magnificent public art gallery he planned
for the city. By the end of the war the <LOCATION>Linz</LOCATION> gallery had accumulated 8,000
pictures, nearly twice the holding built up over a much longer period at
<LOCATION>Amsterdam</LOCATION>'s Rijksmuseum.
But the <LOCATION>Linz</LOCATION> plan was merely one corner of a vast displacement of art around
<LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> during <PERSON>Hitler</PERSON>'s 12 years, caused by many factors. The Nazis sold
'degenerate' art abroad to earn foreign currency. They looted art from Jews
and from occupied territories. The experience of the <LOCATION>Prado</LOCATION> collection during
<LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>'s Civil War persuaded curators everywhere in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, including
<LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>, to make plans for safeguarding works of art against air attack; and
as soon as hostilities impended, tens of thousands of paintings, statues,
objets d'art, rare books and manuscripts were transported into the cellars
of castles beyond the <LOCATION>Loire</LOCATION>, quarries in <LOCATION>Wales</LOCATION>, and storerooms of
monasteries in remote corners of the Italian countryside.
With their usual thoroughness the German occupying administrations in
<LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Czechoslovakia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Holland</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> - after some resistance, in this
last case, from the military government in occupied <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> - appropriated
vast stores of art. Guises of legitimacy were devised: any German art later
than 1500 AD was 'returned' to the <LOCATION>Fatherland</LOCATION> on the grounds that it had
been stolen in earlier wars. Jewish-owned art was simply confiscated. Public
art collections were 'safeguarded', an official euphemism for theft.
When the Allies invaded first <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> and then <LOCATION>Normandy</LOCATION>, they took with them a
desperately understaffed group of men detailed to protect the cultural
treasures that would be encountered in battle areas. This heroic group
managed much with their slender resources. Their greatest triumph, arguably,
was in preventing the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> from appropriating works of art from <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> by way
of war reparations. A batch of 200 pictures was shipped from the American
zone in <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> where it might have formed part of a handsome
covering for the <ORGANIZATION>National Gallery</ORGANIZATION>'s then under-occupied wall spaces. But
there was a vociferous protest from a group of courageous <ORGANIZATION>American
'Monuments</ORGANIZATION>' officers based in <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>, and in the resulting controversy the
<LOCATION>US</LOCATION> returned the works after they had been displayed to huge crowds at
galleries in various cities.
For this, and for their work in rescuing art at the close of the war, the
Allies' Monuments men turn out to be the heroes of <PERSON>Nicholas</PERSON>'s tale. It is a
tale without an ending, because many works are still missing; and some great
achievements in material culture were destroyed, and can never be replaced.
And that, in the end, is the real danger in what happens when art and war
mix.

   LEISURE &amp; ARTS -- Art Crime Update:
   Easter Heist of Antiquities From Ancient Corinth
   ----
   By Constance Lowenthal
</HL>

<LP>
   Just before Easter, as people all over Greece headed to
their home villages or the seashore, jamming roadways, ports
and airports, thieves broke into the Archaeological Museum of
Ancient Corinth. Around 3 a.m., several persons attacked the
solitary 62-year-old night watchman and left him beaten,
bound and gagged. Before the day shift arrived to discover
the crime, the thieves had removed 271 objects -- many works
of Ancient Corinthian pottery; other ceramic works ranging
from the Geometric period to Attic black-figured and
red-figured vases, glass vases and sculpture, including a a
male Kourostype head from about 470 B.C.; and works dating
from Corinth's Roman period. Along with the antiquities, the
burglars took one million drachmas (about $6,100) in cash,
representing two weeks of staff wages and entrance fees from
foreign visitors.
   The thieves used a ladder purchased locally to reach the
museum's roof and descend into the courtyard. Having gathered
their loot, the gang tried without success to exit through
the heavy metal front door. They abandoned their tools,
climbed back up the ladder and then left it behind, covered
with fingerprints.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   From his hospital bed, the guard said two of the men wore
hoods, that they spoke Greek and used walkie-talkies to
communicate with unseen accomplices. Authorities were
immediately notified, border guards alerted, and a huge
nationwide search for the perpetrators began.
   The theft is believed to be the largest ever of Greek
antiquities, and the Greek press suggests that plunderers of
archaeological sites recently have added museums to their hit
lists. Very few thefts from <LOCATION>Greece</LOCATION> are reported to <ORGANIZATION>Interpol</ORGANIZATION>
or to the <ORGANIZATION>International Foundation for Art Research</ORGANIZATION>, but
following the <LOCATION>Corinth</LOCATION> theft, Greek newspapers reported that
an alarming number of incidents, 231, occurred in the last
six months alone. The most important was a robbery in
<DATE>November 1989</DATE> at the <ORGANIZATION>Archaeological Museum</ORGANIZATION> housed in the
Hospital of the Knights in <LOCATION>Rhodes</LOCATION>, where thieves also
disabled a night watchman and entered via the roof. Their
booty consisted largely of Mycenaean gold and jewelry.
   Although connoisseurs might dismiss many of the <LOCATION>Corinth</LOCATION>
items as of only mediocre artistic quality, the theft is a
terrible loss to archaeology. The excavations at Ancient
<LOCATION>Corinth</LOCATION> have operated continuously since <DATE>1896</DATE> under the aegis
of the <ORGANIZATION>American School of Classical Studies</ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION>Athens</LOCATION>. The
school is the largest of the foreign archaeological
institutes in <LOCATION>Greece</LOCATION>, and since its founding in <DATE>1881</DATE> it has
been a home for students and faculty from 153 North American
colleges and universities who have used its libraries and
participated in its excavations. Excavations have unearthed a
Greek agora, a temple to Apollo, fountains and, from Roman
times, several small temples and a large amphitheater. The
<ORGANIZATION>American School</ORGANIZATION> built the museum in <DATE>1931</DATE> and enlarged it in
<DATE>1958</DATE>, but the collections and the museum and its contents are
the property of the Greek government.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Ministry of Culture</ORGANIZATION>, under its newly appointed head,
<PERSON>Tzannis Tzannetakis</PERSON>, issued a statement pledging to reinforce
museum security. As a rule, smaller museums in <LOCATION>Greece</LOCATION> have
few security guards during hours of opening and just one
watchman at night; electronic alarm systems are rare.
Skeptics have been quick to challenge the ministry to
activate those alarm systems that do exist to test which ones
would actually work and to see whether the police would
respond.
   The objects stolen at <LOCATION>Corinth</LOCATION> all were excavated and
studied, and many have been included in scholarly
publications, including the school's journal, <LOCATION>Hesperia</LOCATION>.
Should they be recovered, identification will not be a
problem since all the objects were photographed and properly
recorded, and each piece is marked indelibly to identify it.
   The city of <LOCATION>Ancient Corinth</LOCATION>, slightly inland from the
modern center, dates from Homeric times and became a maritime
power as early as the <DATE>seventh century</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>B.C. Early</ORGANIZATION> painted
pottery from <LOCATION>Corinth</LOCATION> was popular and has been found
throughout the <LOCATION>Mediterranean</LOCATION>. The city's artists also were
known for their bronzes, but most of them were melted down,
especially after <LOCATION>Corinth</LOCATION> was sacked in 146 B.C. by a Roman
army under Gen. <PERSON>Achaicus Lucius Mummius</PERSON>. <PERSON>Julius Caesar</PERSON>
restored the city about a century later.
   Corinth also was notorious as a city of pleasure, a sort
of ancient <LOCATION>Las Vegas</LOCATION> famed for its prostitutes and other
costly diversions. On the cliff above the ancient city,
archaeologists have excavated the remains of a temple to
<LOCATION>Aphrodite</LOCATION>, the goddess of love. Aristophanes is credited with
coining the verb "to <LOCATION>Corinth</LOCATION>," meaning to prostitute oneself.
Even in the <DATE>16th century</DATE>, when <PERSON>Hans Holbein</PERSON> the Younger
painted a portrait of his mistress, <PERSON>Magdalena Offenburg</PERSON>, he
depicted her as a courtesan, "Lais of <LOCATION>Corinth</LOCATION>."

   "Sometimes things can get pretty cloak-and-dagger around here," <PERSON>Connie Lowenthal</PERSON> says. 
At the moment, things in the sunny pseudo-Tudor office where she and two other well-turned-out women sit seem about as sinister as a snoozing tabby. 
But appearances can be as deceptive as that fake <PERSON>Remington</PERSON> over the fireplace. 

   "I remember the phone call we got from two <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> agents on <LOCATION>Staten Island</LOCATION>," the titian-haired <PERSON>Ms. Lowenthal</PERSON> continues. 
"They said, 'We have a painting of a man on horseback with some naked ladies flying behind him -- is it stolen?'" 

   FBI? 
Stolen? 
Naked women? 
All in a day's work for <PERSON>Ms. Lowenthal</PERSON> and her associates. 
The trio may look like just a couple of ladies who lunch, but don't be duped. 
These babes are crime busters, warriors in the underpersoned battle against the billion-dollar-a-year rackets of art theft and fraud. 

   They fight under the banner of the <ORGANIZATION>International Foundation for Art Research</ORGANIZATION> (<ORGANIZATION>IFAR</ORGANIZATION>), a non-profit New York-based group. 
Their major weapon: A magazine. 

   The publication, IFARreports, hits the streets 10 times a year. 
Each glossy black-and-white issue pictures 100 to 200 of the stolen artworks reported to the group by law-enforcement agencies, insurance companies and theft victims around the world (the information also is recorded in <ORGANIZATION>IFAR</ORGANIZATION>'s Art Theft Archive, which has logged 28,000 objects during its decade of operation). 
Sometimes the results can be dramatic. 

   Like the time a new subscriber opened his first issue to discover the marble head he'd just received from an overseas dealer was stolen. 
Thanks to <ORGANIZATION>IFAR</ORGANIZATION>, this portrait bust of <LOCATION>Socrates</LOCATION> was sent back home to <PERSON>Hadrian</PERSON>'s Villa at <ORGANIZATION>Tivoli</ORGANIZATION> outside <LOCATION>Rome</LOCATION>. 

   On other occasions, life at <ORGANIZATION>IFAR</ORGANIZATION> really does turn cloak-and-daggerish. 
"Publication of stolen art sometimes does make objects too hot to handle and things do get returned through lockers at <ORGANIZATION>Grand Central</ORGANIZATION> and anonymous phone calls," observes <PERSON>Ms. Lowenthal</PERSON>, who became <ORGANIZATION>IFAR</ORGANIZATION>'s executive director in <DATE>1985</DATE> after several years in the education department of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. 

   The magazine's current issue describes how the 19th-century painter <PERSON>Edward Moran</PERSON>'s "Squally Day at <LOCATION>Newport</LOCATION>" was recovered by a <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> gallery, in a parking lot, at night, in exchange for a lot of reward money. (About <PERCENT>12%</PERCENT> of missing art eventually is retrieved, the same rate as for stolen boats.) 

   In another case, the magazine told how notes documenting a conversation between an <ORGANIZATION>IFAR</ORGANIZATION> staffer and a private eye helped lead to a <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> pawnbroker's arrest for possession of a stolen <PERSON>Georges Roualt</PERSON> painting valued at a <MONEY>quarter-million dollars</MONEY>. 

   "It's really on-the-spot stuff; my husband says he's going to buy me a shoulder holster," jokes <PERSON>Margaret I. O'Brien</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> native who became editor of IFARreports in <DATE>May</DATE> after a career in advertising. 

   The third member of the <ORGANIZATION>IFAR</ORGANIZATION> triumvirate is 10-year veteran <PERSON>Virgilia Heimsath Pancoast</PERSON>, who runs the art authentication service. 
Within the past year the motherly <PERSON>Mrs. Pancoast</PERSON>, the office's dispenser of advice and Kleenex, married off a daughter and a son and also helped <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> authorities probe the multimillion-dollar traffic in fake Dali prints. 

   This mild-mannered connoisseur provides IFARreports with some of its most lurid yarns of art thuggery and post-Holmesian detection. 
<PERSON>Mrs. Pancoast</PERSON> once aimed X-rays at a powerful painting of <ORGANIZATION>St. Paul</ORGANIZATION> attributed to the 17th-century French artist <PERSON>Philippe de Champaigne</PERSON>. 
Underneath the visible layer of paint was a completely different portrait of two figures -- in 18th-century dress. 

   IFARreports holds its 1,100 subscribers spellbound with tales of serendipity -- the man who discovered his stolen Cesare Detti odalisque listed in a <ORGANIZATION>Christie</ORGANIZATION>'s sales catalog. 
And tales of woe -- the <ORGANIZATION>Bel Air</ORGANIZATION> chatelaine who one day took a good look at the picture hanging in a rarely used card room only to find that instead of her half-million-dollar impressionist oil the frame contained a high-quality photograph of the work. 

   Then there was the case of the devious dealer, a woman who exploited the art world's trust-and-a-handshake business practices. 
Until her fraud conviction, smooth-talking <PERSON>Claire Eatz</PERSON> worked an elaborate shell game. 
She'd take art from other dealers on consignment, sell it, and keep the proceeds. 
When pressed for payment <PERSON>Mrs. Eatz</PERSON> would get the pieces on consignment from the purchasers and return them to the original owners -- who no longer held title. 

   And let's not forget that painting of the gentleman and the naked ladies. 
After <ORGANIZATION>IFAR</ORGANIZATION> told the inquiring <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> agents the work was indeed hot, G-men working undercover on another case were able to retrieve it. 
The painting? 
<PERSON>Eugene Delacroix</PERSON>'s "Tam O'Shanter Pursued by Witches." 

   Such major names as <LOCATION>Delacroix</LOCATION> surface only occasionally in IFARreports, especially in the annual issue containing the <ORGANIZATION>Interpol</ORGANIZATION> Most Wanted List (the current one includes paintings by <LOCATION>Corot</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Titian</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Veronese</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>El Greco</ORGANIZATION>). 
Generally, however, thefts are skewed toward the most negotiable -- and portable -- pieces rather than the most valuable ones. 
"Anyone stealing a van Gogh is ridiculous," says editor <PERSON>O'Brien</PERSON>. 
"How ever can they expect to unload it?" 

   Judging from recent IFARreports, among the items the light-fingered particularly fancy are Oriental rugs, folk art and antique clocks, many conveniently equipped with handles. 
But thefts have lately included a second-century Roman general's sarcophagus, a 1476 <PERSON>Thomas Aquinas</PERSON> volume, and a group of antique mantels -- just about everything except the area in which <ORGANIZATION>IFAR</ORGANIZATION> director <PERSON>Lowenthal</PERSON> got her doctorate, 16th-century German sculpture ("there's not much traffic in it, licit or illicit"). 

   "With the thefts in one issue you could probably furnish a mansion," <PERSON>Ms. Lowenthal</PERSON> muses. 
"But between the <LOCATION>Louis</LOCATION> chairs and the prints and the ethnographic objects, it would be quite a tasteless assortment."

   Art Theft (and Sometimes Recovery): News From IFAR

   Although New York is America's leading art market, its
art-recovery law has not been a shining exemplar of Yankee
plain-spokenness. Indeed, New York has no statute expressly
for the recovery of stolen art, only an idiosyncratic muddle
of case law. Clarity, however, may be just around the corner.
The state's highest court, the Court of Appeals, now has an
opportunity to define the law, in a ruling expected after
Labor Day.
   Just last year, a New York Supreme Court judge (the
state's lowest judicial level) rebuffed the Solomon R.
Guggenheim Museum, saying it could not sue to recover a
Chagall gouache from Mrs. Jules Lubell because, since the
work's disappearance in the mid-1960s, the museum had taken
no action to report or recover it. But the Guggenheim is
back, having taken its case to the Appellate Division, whose
five judges decided unanimously in late January that the
museum's inaction should not prohibit it from bringing suit.
The Appellate Division's opinion said such cases should be
determined neither by statutes of limitations nor by tests of
due diligence, but rather by a court deciding whether both
parties had behaved reasonably at the time. Mrs. Lubell then
asked to have the Court of Appeals rule on the question, and
on March 29, despite the unanimity of the intermediate court,
it was decided that the highest court would do so.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Litigation to recover stolen art is not rare. Right now in
<LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, the Republic of <LOCATION>Turkey</LOCATION> is waiting to hear if its
suit against the Metropolitan Museum of Art, claiming
ownership of the Lydian Hoard, more than 200 works of ancient
silver, will be heard. The <LOCATION>Netherlands</LOCATION> is suing <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>
developer and art collector <PERSON>Ian Woodner</PERSON> to get a <PERSON>Hans Baldung
Grien</PERSON> drawing it contends was in a collection stolen by the
<ORGANIZATION>Nazis</ORGANIZATION>.
   Earlier this year, <LOCATION>Lebanon</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Yugoslavia</LOCATION> each asked a <LOCATION>New
York</LOCATION> court to freeze Sotheby's proposed sale of the <ORGANIZATION>Sevso
Treasure</ORGANIZATION>, a magnificent group of late Roman silver reportedly
purchased by the Marquess of <LOCATION>Northampton</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Switzerland</LOCATION> in
the <DATE>1970s</DATE>. The treasure is said to have an export license
from <LOCATION>Lebanon</LOCATION>, but <LOCATION>Yugoslavia</LOCATION>'s papers assert that the
treasure was excavated in the early '70s near <LOCATION>Pula</LOCATION> in the
Yugoslavian province of <LOCATION>Istria</LOCATION>, where the <PERSON>Sevso</PERSON> family was
prominent, that its export was illegal, and that Yugoslavian
title to the silver is superior to any other.
   The <ORGANIZATION>New York Court of Appeals</ORGANIZATION> ruling will affect not only
the suits currently under consideration, but the behavior of
people in the art market. Every day, situations crop up in
which people require legal counsel, as they contemplate
acquiring works without provenance or decide whether or not
to return works of art requested by original owners.
   A <LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION> man came in to <ORGANIZATION>IFAR</ORGANIZATION> to inquire whether a
17th-century English clock he'd bought at an antique shop in
<LOCATION>Valhalla</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>, had been stolen; we informed him that a
<LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION> dealer had reported the theft of one that appeared
to be identical in <DATE>1977</DATE>. The clock now is worth upward of
<MONEY>$200,000</MONEY>, and attorneys for the two parties are negotiating.
   A private art dealer recently called <ORGANIZATION>IFAR</ORGANIZATION>'s Art Theft
Archive to see if the beautiful <PERSON>Chagall</PERSON> oil painting he was
being offered was hot. He didn't know the sellers, and the
price was too low, he believed; "I'm not that lucky," he told
us. He wasn't. The painting had been stolen in <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION> in
<DATE>1970</DATE>. Its current value is more than <MONEY>$1 million</MONEY>. Lawyers have
arranged the return.
   Civil suits are much more common than criminal actions in
cases of art theft. But <DATE>April 30</DATE> is the trial date for
Madison Avenue art dealer <PERSON>Michael Weisbrod</PERSON>, who is accused of
buying two Chinese porcelains and an 18th-century pink coral
carving knowing they were stolen.
   The thieves had robbed museums in <LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Albany</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Syracuse</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION> of
decorative-arts items including a silver <ORGANIZATION>Tiffany</ORGANIZATION> pitcher; a
ceramic masterpiece of <DATE>1910</DATE>, <PERSON>Adelaide Alsop Robineau</PERSON>'s
"Scarab Vase"; the Chinese porcelains; and a group of English
antique pocket watches. They were caught after an attempt to
sell the watches. <PERSON>Mr. Weisbrod</PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON>Richard Berne</PERSON>,
told <ORGANIZATION>IFAR</ORGANIZATION> that he and his client are "confident that he will
be exonerated."

A NEW PAINTING -- AND A NEW PAINT JOB -- AT ART MUSEUM

The opening today of four newly painted and reinstalled galleries at the <ORGANIZATION>County 
Museum of Art</ORGANIZATION> makes all the artworks look like brand-new acquisitions, but one 
painting is the real thing. "<ORGANIZATION>St. Ignatius Loyola's Vision of Christ</ORGANIZATION> and God the 
Father at La Storta," an Italian Baroque altarpiece by <ORGANIZATION>Domenichino</ORGANIZATION>, is a recent 
gift of the <ORGANIZATION>Ahmanson Foundation</ORGANIZATION>. The glowing devotional painting, depicting a 
saint at a spellbound moment, goes on view today in the museum's 17th-Century 
gallery. 
</P>
<P>
As a matter of policy, the museum does not disclose prices of new acquisitions, 
but the <ORGANIZATION>Domenichino</ORGANIZATION> is a rare and beautiful work that many institutions would 
like to have, according to <PERSON>Philip Conisbee</PERSON>, curator of European paintings and 
sculpture. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been a great deal of eyebrow raising in the museum world" over 
<ORGANIZATION>LACMA</ORGANIZATION>'s good fortune in landing the picture, museum director <PERSON>Earl A. Powell</PERSON> 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Though not well known and not in fashion, <ORGANIZATION>Domenichino</ORGANIZATION>'s stock is rising. "He 
has been rediscovered in the <DATE>last 20 years</DATE> as part of a scholarly 
re-examination of Italian Baroque painting," <PERSON>Conisbee</PERSON> said. This particular 
canvas, which has been in private European collections and was purchased with 
<ORGANIZATION>Ahmanson</ORGANIZATION> funds from a <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> dealer, came to light in the early '80s -- just in 
time to be included in the appendix of <PERSON>Richard Spear</PERSON>'s monograph on the artist. 
</P>
<P>
The richly colored altarpiece was commissioned for the <ORGANIZATION>Church of Gesu</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Rome</LOCATION> 
by <ORGANIZATION>Cardinal Odoardo Farnese</ORGANIZATION> in about <DATE>1622</DATE>, the year <LOCATION>St. Ignatius Loyola</LOCATION> was 
canonized. The painting hung in the church for awhile but was removed during 
<ORGANIZATION>Domenichino</ORGANIZATION>'s lifetime and replaced with a copy made in his studio. Scholars 
believe that the original was privately sold, but records are incomplete. 
</P>
<P>
"<ORGANIZATION>St. Ignatius Loyola's Vision of Christ</ORGANIZATION> and God the Father at La Storta" 
portrays a priest on a journey in <DATE>1537</DATE> to <LOCATION>Rome</LOCATION> where he planned to seek papal 
approval of the new religious order of Jesuits. At La Storta, 10 miles 
northwest of <LOCATION>Rome</LOCATION>, the priest had a vision of the holy father and son in which 
Christ declared, "I shall be merciful to thee in <LOCATION>Rome</LOCATION>." 
</P>
<P>
Domenichino has portrayed this episode in the priest's life as a moment of 
divine inspiration. The rapt priest, on his knees, looks up to the heavens 
where he sees God in human form, Christ holding and pointing to a cross (the 
symbol of the Jesuits) and angels. The congregation appears to float in a 
profusion of golden clouds that are composed of cherubic faces. 
</P>
<P>
Domenichino (1581-1641) was born <PERSON>Domenico Zampieri</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Bologna</LOCATION>. He was the 
favorite pupil of <PERSON>Annibale Carracci</PERSON> and a friend and rival of painter <PERSON>Guido 
Reni</PERSON>, two of whose works are owned by <ORGANIZATION>LACMA</ORGANIZATION>. They are currently in a traveling 
exhibition, but, upon their return, the museum will display them with the 
Domenichino and two earlier <ORGANIZATION>Ahmanson</ORGANIZATION> gifts, Georges de La Tour's "Magdalen With 
the Smoking Flame" and <PERSON>Philippe de Champaigne</PERSON>'s "St. Augustine." 
</P>
<P>
Domenichino, who painted in a more classical style than <PERSON>Reni</PERSON>, is primarily 
known for frescoes on buildings in <LOCATION>Rome</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Naples</LOCATION>. He did relatively few easel 
paintings. "There are maybe a dozen in the world," <PERSON>Conisbee</PERSON> said. "St. 
Ignatius" is a fine example because of its "classical perfection of form" and 
pristine condition. "Every brush mark is from Domenichino's hand," the curator 
said, noting that the painting had been properly cared for and not repainted by 
restorers. 
</P>
<P>
Three other refurbished galleries opening today display the museum's 
collections of 18th-Century art (including the recently acquired "Portrait of 
the Devin Family" by Louis-Michel van Loo), 19th-Century paintings and 
sculpture and works by the French Romantics.

<TEXT>
<P>
The <LOCATION>San Diego Museum</LOCATION> of Art has appointed <PERSON>Ellen Smart</PERSON> its first curator of 
Indian paintings. 
</P>
<P>
Smart, 45, will be in charge of about 1,400 Indian paintings and manuscript 
illuminations bequeathed to the museum in <DATE>1986</DATE> by <PERSON>Edwin Binney III</PERSON>, a former 
museum trustee. 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>Binney Collection</ORGANIZATION>, valued at <MONEY>$40 million</MONEY> to <MONEY>$50 million</MONEY>, spans more than 
seven centuries of Indian art from <LOCATION>Rajasthan</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Agra</LOCATION>, from a rare, 12th-Century 
manuscript on palm leaves to 20th-Century paintings. 
</P>
<P>
"It will take me a couple of years just to see what's here," said <PERSON>Smart</PERSON>, who 
begins at the museum in <DATE>May</DATE>. She will continue doing independent art research 
in <LOCATION>Rhode Island</LOCATION> until then. Her appointment was announced <DATE>Thursday</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Smart first became acquainted with works in the <ORGANIZATION>Binney Collection</ORGANIZATION> when she saw 
them in a show in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> in the late <DATE>1960s</DATE>. At the time, she was 
studying for her master's degree at <ORGANIZATION>UC Berkeley</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been working with Indian paintings ever since," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The works -- described by museum director <PERSON>Steven Brezzo</PERSON> as "a breathtaking 
addition to the (museum) collection" -- were held in probate until just <DATE>last 
month</DATE>, when complex negotiations between the museum, <ORGANIZATION>Binney</ORGANIZATION>'s estate and the 
<LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION> attorney general's office finally concluded. 
</P>
<P>
An exhibition of highlights from the collection is scheduled at the museum for 
next <DATE>December</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Smart, a specialist in 16th- and 17th-Century Mughal painting, received her 
Ph.D. in the art and archeology of <LOCATION>South Asia</LOCATION> from the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>. 
She has worked as a research curator and a consultant for such institutions as 
the Nelson-Atkins Gallery of Art in <LOCATION>Kansas City</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mo.</LOCATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION>Walters Art 
Gallery</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION>. In <DATE>1988</DATE>, she was named a <ORGANIZATION>Fulbright Scholar</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Smart's publications range from children's books to articles in scholarly 
journals. According to <PERSON>Brezzo</PERSON>, it was important to find a curator "committed to 
public education" because Indian art has had so little exposure in <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>.

@  Greek Cup and Other Treasures Lost, Found

<TEXT>
   An ancient red-figured Greek kylix, or drinking cup, was recovered backstage at <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby</ORGANIZATION>'s this <DATE>spring</DATE> and has been returned to the <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION> couple who lost it in a burglary three years ago. 
Robert Guy, an associate curator at the <ORGANIZATION>Princeton Art Museum</ORGANIZATION>, was previewing a <DATE>June</DATE> antiquities sale at the auction house when he recognized the kylix, which he, as a specialist in <LOCATION>Attic</LOCATION> pottery and a careful reader of the Stolen Art Alert in "IFAR Reports," knew was stolen. 
The timing of his visit was fortuitous; the man who had brought it in for an estimate had returned to collect it and was waiting in the hall. 
To confirm <PERSON>Mr. Guy</PERSON>'s identification, <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby's</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>IFAR</ORGANIZATION> exchanged photos by fax, and the waiting man, apparently innocent of knowledge that the kylix was stolen, agreed to release it. 
The cup had been insured, and in short order it was given over to a <ORGANIZATION>Chubb &amp; Son</ORGANIZATION> representative. 
The original owners happily repaid the claim and took their kylix home.

   A former curator of the <ORGANIZATION>Museum of Cartoon Art</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Rye Brook</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>, pleaded guilty in <DATE>July</DATE> to stealing and selling original signed and dated comic strips, among them 29 <PERSON>Dick Tracy</PERSON> strips by <PERSON>Chester Gould</PERSON>, 77 Prince Valiant <DATE>Sunday</DATE> cartoons by <PERSON>Hal Foster</PERSON>, and a dozen Walt Disney animation celluloids, according to <PERSON>Barbara Hammond</PERSON>, the museum's director. 
He sold them well below market value to raise cash "to pay off mounting credit-card debts," incurred to buy presents for his girlfriend, his attorney, <PERSON>Philip Russell</PERSON>, told <ORGANIZATION>IFAR</ORGANIZATION>. 
The curator, 27-year-old <PERSON>Sherman Krisher</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Greenwich</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Conn.</LOCATION>, had worked his way up from janitor in seven years at the museum. 
The theft was discovered early this year, soon after <PERSON>Ms. Hammond</PERSON> took her post. 

   Sentencing was postponed on <DATE>Aug. 18</DATE>, when <PERSON>Mr. Krisher</PERSON> was hospitalized for depression. 
His efforts to get back the stolen strips had resulted in recovery of just three. 
But on <DATE>Oct. 6</DATE>, he had reason to celebrate. 
Two days earlier, his attorney met in a Park Avenue law office with a cartoon dealer who expected to sell 44 of the most important stolen strips to <PERSON>Mr. Russell</PERSON> for <MONEY>$62,800</MONEY>. 
Instead, <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION> police seized the stolen goods, and <PERSON>Mr. Krisher</PERSON> avoided jail. 
He was sentenced to 500 hours of community service and restitution to the museum of <MONEY>$45,000</MONEY>. 

   ---Authorities at <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Heathrow Airport</LOCATION> are investigating the disappearance of a <PERSON>Paul Gauguin</PERSON> watercolor, "Young Tahitian Woman in a Red Pareo," that has two sketches on its verso (opposite) side. 
Valued at <MONEY>$1.3 million</MONEY>, it was part of a four-crate shipment. 
The air-waybill number was changed en route, and paper work showing that the crates had cleared customs was misplaced, so it was a week before three of the four crates could be located in a bonded warehouse and the <PERSON>Gauguin</PERSON> discovered missing. 
Although <LOCATION>Heathrow</LOCATION> authorities have been watching a group of allegedly crooked baggage handlers for some time, the <PERSON>Gauguin</PERSON> may be "lost." 
Chief Inspector <PERSON>Peter Seacomb</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Criminal Investigation Department</ORGANIZATION> at the airport said, "It is not uncommon for property to be temporarily mislaid or misrouted." 

   Officials at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Virginia Art Museum</ORGANIZATION> certainly would agree. 
Their museum had purchased an Attic black-figured column krater and shipped it from <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>. 
It was reported stolen in transit en route to <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION>, in <DATE>February</DATE>. 
Months later, the Greek vase arrived in good condition at the museum in <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION>, having inexplicably traveled by a circuitous route through <LOCATION>Nairobi</LOCATION>.

   Two Mexican college dropouts, not professional art thieves, have been arrested for a <DATE>1985 Christmas</DATE> Eve burglary from the <ORGANIZATION>National Museum of Anthropology</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Mexico City</LOCATION>. 
About 140 Mayan, <LOCATION>Aztec</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Mixtec</PERSON> and Zapotec objects, including some of <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>'s best-known archaeological treasures, were taken. 
The government offered a reward for the return of the antiquities, but routine police work led to the recovery. 
As it turned out, <PERSON>Carlos Perches Trevino</PERSON> and <PERSON>Ramon Sardina Garcia</PERSON> had hidden the haul in a closet in the <LOCATION>Perches</LOCATION> family's home for a year. 
Then they took the art to <LOCATION>Acapulco</LOCATION> and began to trade some of it for cocaine. 
Information from an arrested drug trafficker led to the two men and the recovery of almost all the stolen art. 

   ---

   Among other happy news bulletins from the German Democratic Republic, the <ORGANIZATION>Leipzig Museum of Fine Arts</ORGANIZATION> announced that it has recovered "Cemetery in the Snow," a painting by the German Romantic painter <PERSON>Caspar David Friedrich</PERSON>. 
The artist's melancholy subjects bring high prices on the world market, and the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. State Department</ORGANIZATION> notified <ORGANIZATION>IFAR</ORGANIZATION> of the theft in <DATE>February 1988</DATE>. 
According to a source at the <LOCATION>East Europe</LOCATION> desk, two previously convicted felons were charged, tried, convicted and sentenced to prison terms of four and 12 years. 

   The precious canvas, cut from its frame at the time of the theft, was found in nearby <PERSON>Jena</PERSON>, hidden in the upholstery of an easy chair in the home of the girlfriend of one of the thieves. 
No charges were brought against her. 

   ---

   Trompe l'oeil painting is meant to fool the eye, but <PERSON>Robert Lawrence Trotter</PERSON>, 35, of <LOCATION>Kennett Square</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pa.</LOCATION>, took his fooling seriously. 
He painted one himself in the style of <PERSON>John Haberle</PERSON> and sold it as a 19th-century original to antique dealers in <LOCATION>Woodbridge</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Conn</LOCATION>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Trotter</PERSON>'s painting showed a wall of wood boards with painted ribbons tacked down in a rectangle; tucked behind the ribbons were envelopes, folded, faded and crumpled papers and currency.

   The dealers immediately showed their new acquisition to an expert and came to see it as a fake. 
They persuaded <PERSON>Mr. Trotter</PERSON> to take it back and, with the help of the <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION>, taped their conversation with him. 
After his arrest, the forger admitted to faking and selling other paintings up and down the <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> seaboard.

FT  17 JUL 93 / Arts: Flanders comes to Cambridge - Patricia Morison enjoys
an illuminating collection of late medieval art at the Fitzwilliam museum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
IT IS not tremendously likely, but imagine a day when conservators exercise
complete control over the shape of art exhibitions world wide. Imagine, too,
that the conservators then decreed that historic artifacts should lead
virtually risk-free lives at home.
No more grandiose government-sponsored shows of the like of <DATE>last year</DATE>'s
Hispania-Austria, which procured hundreds of exceptionally precious
15th-century artifacts from museums in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>, and freighted
them first to <LOCATION>Toledo</LOCATION> and then to <LOCATION>Innsbruck</LOCATION>. What kind of art exhibitions
might we then see?
An exhibition of 15th-century Flemish art which has just opened at the
<LOCATION>Fitzwilliam Museum</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Cambridge</LOCATION> suggests what might be achieved if ever the
age of the jet-setting art-treasure ends. Splendours of <LOCATION>Flanders</LOCATION>; Late
Medieval Art in <LOCATION>Cambridge</LOCATION> Collections brings together some 70 exhibits -
panel-paintings, drawings, one well-preserved tapestry, sculpture, coins, an
iron-bound safe on wheels, printed books and illuminated manuscripts.
Unsurprisingly, the largest share of objects belongs to the <LOCATION>Fitzwilliam</LOCATION>'s
own collection, where they can be seen (so long as you arrive on the right
day; the downstairs, with its medieval treasures in the <ORGANIZATION>Rothschild Gallery</ORGANIZATION>,
is closed in the afternoons.) A significant number of exhibits belong to
colleges and the <ORGANIZATION>University Library</ORGANIZATION>, and are not readily on view.
Not many Cantabrigians normally manage to inspect <ORGANIZATION>Sidney Sussex College</ORGANIZATION>'s
iron-bound chest. It was brought back in <DATE>1607</DATE> from a synod in Flanders by a
Master who, like his 20th-century successors, seems to have been concerned
to step up college security. The massive chest had a complex locking
mechanism of three keys which required to be operated in sequence by the
junior bursar, the senior bursar, and the Master himself.
Queen's College has lent the exhibit which is the 'discovery' of the
exhibition; three panels showing scenes from the life of Christ, which would
have been the wings for a large altarpiece. Remarkably, it seems that the
panels may have been in <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> since before the Reformation.
The show's curators give this rare survival to the Master of the <ORGANIZATION>View of
Saint Gudule</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION> artist with a fondness for lively scenes and male
figures with features like pug-dogs. In Queen's chapel, the panels can be
viewed only from the front, whereas in the exhibition the saints on the
reverse are also visible.
Among the <LOCATION>Fitzwilliam</LOCATION>'s own Flemish paintings, the most famous is <PERSON>Joos Van
Cleve</PERSON>'s Virgin and Child, a lovely image of a baby who seems just that
instant to have fallen asleep on his mother's breast, to her huge
satisfaction. Another more modest <PERSON>Virgin</PERSON> and Child is thought to be by the
<PERSON>Joos</PERSON>'s son, <ORGANIZATION>Cornelis Van Cleve</ORGANIZATION>. '<PERSON>Daft Cleve</PERSON>' was one of the Flemish artists
who in the far less favourable conditions of the <DATE>mid-16th century</DATE>, decided
instead to try his luck in <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> where (for reasons unknown) he went mad.
Manuscripts and books are unquestionably the strength of the 'Splendours of
<ORGANIZATION>Flanders</ORGANIZATION>'. Among single leaves detached from illuminated manuscripts are
several by the famous master, <PERSON>Simon Bening</PERSON>. One of his full-page
illuminations of The Annunciation shows in the margin a charming scene of
the <LOCATION>Virgin</LOCATION> apparently going for a stroll in the countryside, followed by an
angel, presumably carrying her workbox, not her lunchbox.
The <ORGANIZATION>Lord of Enghien</ORGANIZATION> we see in a full-page illumination in his personal Book
of Hours, kneeling before <PERSON>St Hubert</PERSON>, the patron of hunters. Someone else
paid handsomely for a Bruges manuscript with a fine set of the traditional
Labours of the Month, enlivening the calendar of feastdays and saints' days.
We can only see the book open at <DATE>September</DATE>, harvesting grapes, but
photographs of the other months also show scenes of sophisticated urban life
 -driving about in carriages and in <DATE>May</DATE>, courting one's mistress with a band
of minstrels.
What I particularly liked about this exhibition is its clear explanation of
the role of medieval religious books, particularly Books of Hours. These
were virtually mass-produced in towns like <LOCATION>Bruges</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Tournai</LOCATION>, or <ORGANIZATION>Valenciennes</ORGANIZATION>.
Many were exported to <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> with the addition of English saints, such as
St <PERSON>Thomas Becket</PERSON>. In the Low Countries, ruled for a century by Burgundian
dukes with the keenest appreciation of fine books, it was an essential mark
of social status to own an attractive book of prayers.
The richer the client, the more miniatures and illuminated capitals he or
she could afford, not to mention 'personalised' books in which they and
their name-saints appeared. The skills of even a thoroughly dull painter did
not come cheap. In a fascinating and highly readable book published earlier
this year, Medieval Illuminators and their Methods of Work, (<ORGANIZATION>Yale</ORGANIZATION>; Pounds
35; 210pp.) <PERSON>Jonathan Alexander</PERSON> points out that in <DATE>1463</DATE>, the celebrated
artist, <PERSON>Simon Marmion</PERSON>, earned enough from illustrating just one manuscript
to have the thatch on his house replaced with tiles.
By no means all the books are religious. The humanist outlook of the
<ORGANIZATION>Renaissance</ORGANIZATION> is represented by a group of manuscripts which do not come from
<LOCATION>Cambridge</LOCATION>. They are four superb illuminated manuscripts of classical texts
borrowed from the library established in the <DATE>18th century</DATE> by <ORGANIZATION>Thomas Coke of
Holkham Hall</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Norfolk</LOCATION>. No doubt the famous agriculturalist particularly
enjoyed the page in the Virgil Collected Works which illustrates farmers'
tasks, everything from coppicing to luring a swarm of bees.
The fully illustrated catalogue of the exhibition is well worth having, not
least for an excellent historical introduction narrating how the Dukes of
Burgundy pieced together their great inheritance in the Low Countries, broke
with <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, and created a Burgundian 'nation'. (A comparison between the
sexual appetites of <LOCATION>Philip</LOCATION> the Good and President <PERSON>Kennedy</PERSON> is
thought-provoking.)
Catalogue and exhibition are sponsored by the bank <ORGANIZATION>Gemeentekrediet</ORGANIZATION> (Credit
Communal) and the Flemish government, which has named the show Cultural
Ambassador for <ORGANIZATION>Flanders</ORGANIZATION>. Is this the first time that a foreign sponsor has
been willing to pay up for a show which will only be seen in a foreign
country? The <LOCATION>Fitzwilliam</LOCATION> made clear that the works of art were not going to
go to the <ORGANIZATION>Flemings</ORGANIZATION>. So the sponsor agreed that is the <ORGANIZATION>Flemings</ORGANIZATION> who must go
to <LOCATION>Cambridge</LOCATION> - after all, it is only a short hop to <LOCATION>Stanstead</LOCATION>. Is this,
then, to be the nature of arts sponsorship in the 21st century?

Saving the Cathedrals
---
By Nicholas Powell</HL>
<DD> 12/04/87</DD>
<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO>
<DATELINE> Paris  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The sweetly malicious smile on the face of the angel on the facade of <ORGANIZATION>Reims Cathedral</ORGANIZATION> is the second most famous artistic grin in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>. 
It is second, of course, only to that on the <PERSON>Mona Lisa</PERSON>. 
But whereas <PERSON>Leonardo da Vinci</PERSON>'s smug lady behind her protective glass panel is safe from everything bar nuclear war, the smile on the angel could one day be nothing more than a postcard souvenir. 
For the pollution gnawing away at <LOCATION>Reims</LOCATION> and the other 86 cathedrals of <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> has caused more damage over the past 100 years than the monuments suffered during seven centuries or so. 

   The French government, after decades of financial neglect, has voted extra funds to help restore cathedrals. 
But the current allocation of <MONEY>$16 million</MONEY> a year is grossly insufficient to counteract the effects of atmospheric pollution, the subsiding of earth under foundations, and even damage dating back to the two World Wars. 
Budget-gobbling projects such as the Orsay Museum, the <ORGANIZATION>Bastille Opera</ORGANIZATION> and renovating the <LOCATION>Louvre</LOCATION> -- which alone cost almost <MONEY>$1 billion</MONEY> -- put solving the problem of the sad state of <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>'s cathedrals into a back seat for a number of years. 
Most French people are unaware of the plight of their Romanesque and Gothic masterpieces, which are visited, free of charge, by around 100 million visitors every year. 

   Some cathedrals fare better than others. 
<LOCATION>Chartres</LOCATION>, for example, built in the <DATE>early 13th century</DATE>, is in fine health, thanks to the unusually high quality of its stone. 
But <LOCATION>Strasbourg</LOCATION>, built between the 11th and 14th centuries in red sandstone, has suffered from modern pollution. 
Only a quarter of the sculptures on its western facade are original. 
The Last Judgment frieze was replaced in the <DATE>1840s</DATE> and the statues of the Apostles were resculpted in <DATE>1910</DATE> and again in <DATE>1983</DATE>. 
The weak foundations of the northern tower were reinforced with concrete <DATE>early this century</DATE>, which has had the side effect of putting strain on other parts of the structure that now need to be consolidated. 

   Yves Boiret, architect in charge of 13th-century <ORGANIZATION>Reims Cathedral</ORGANIZATION>, faces two major problems. 
The first is filling in small and dangerous cracks in the northern tower, which was damaged during a World War I bombardment. 
The building caught fire and the roofing melted, sending molten lead gushing through the mouths of medieval gargoyles. 
For years the north tower was left unrepaired as a testimony to the wartime bombing, meaning that damage was aggravated with each spell of frost. 

   A more delicate task at <LOCATION>Reims</LOCATION> is restoring the cathedral's magnificent sculptures, which are under constant attack from humidity, atmospheric pollution and high winds. 

   Since the <DATE>1950s</DATE>, when the cathedral began receiving attention, badly damaged statues have been replaced with stone copies that stand out from the rest because there is no way of artificially aging them. 
To make matters worse, the stone of <ORGANIZATION>Reims Cathedral</ORGANIZATION> is almost impossible to find in local quarries. 
<PERSON>Mr. Boiret</PERSON> is considering molding copies of statues in resinous materials covered with powdered stone. 
That leaves the question of where to store the damaged originals and whether to replace 13th-century works that are intact but that risk being eroded. 

   The <ORGANIZATION>Sainte Croix Cathedral of Orleans</ORGANIZATION> was built between <DATE>1599</DATE> and the <DATE>early 19th century</DATE> on the site of a previous cathedral destroyed by Protestants during the 16th-century <ORGANIZATION>Wars of Religion</ORGANIZATION>. 
Aesthetically and architecturally speaking, it is more of a curiosity than a thing of beauty, a Gothic structure built during a neoclassical period with more decorative stone swirls per pinnacle than anything built during the Middle Ages. 
Unfortunately those extravagantly pseudo-Gothic architects were so keen on being medieval that they forgot the basic masonic wisdom of putting in plenty of gutters and gargoyles to cope with rainwater. 
The Orleans cathedral is thus a sort of intricate stone sieve, continually being eaten away by rain -- a peeling, crumbling wreck built in the same creamy-colored stone as the chateaux of the <LOCATION>Loire Valley</LOCATION>. 

   It is an anthology of restoration problems. 
The foundations are poor. 
The stone is crumbly. 
Architects put no roofs in the western towers, leaving rain and bird droppings, which corrode stone, free to ooze down to ground level. 
Many of the stained glass windows have simply dropped out. 
The 11 chapels around the high altar have been abandoned for years -- damp, musty and littered with fallen paint work. 
A copious crop of moss lichen and grass is eating into the stonework. 
Replacement stone is hard to find. 
The clergy uses only a small part of the building for services and local people understandably tend to go to parish churches. 
Hardly any tourists visit. 

   <PERSON>Jacques Moulin</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Orleans</LOCATION>'s architect inchief, is replacing some of the lost 19th-century stained glass by copying the original patterns. 
He also is inviting modern artists to contribute designs. 
And he is replacing stonework in the 19 flying buttresses that need repair, at the tune of <MONEY>$1.4 million</MONEY> per buttress. 
Unlike <PERSON>Mr. Boiret</PERSON> at <LOCATION>Reims</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Moulin</PERSON> is unwilling to use resin molding, preferring to keep <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>'s 50 specialist sculptors in work. 
He has an annual budget of <MONEY>$1.25 million</MONEY> and could do with three times as much. 

   Neither the state nor the clergy can or will put forward so much money. 
"The money is there; it is just the will that is lacking," says <PERSON>Mr. Moulin</PERSON>. 
"That will only return when the monument is once again at the heart of public life, as it was in the Middle Ages."

<TEXT>
   Two thieves with a talent for disguise and a taste
for <ORGANIZATION>Rembrandt</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Degas</PERSON> stole 11 paintings valued at upwards of
<MONEY>$100 million</MONEY> in a daring theft from the <ORGANIZATION>Isabella Stewart Gardner
Museum</ORGANIZATION>.
   But experts say the paintings are so priceless, in one sense
they're worthless. Any legitimate collector or dealer would
recognize them and wouldn't pay a penny, they say.
   ``People make pilgrimages to see these paintings. Scholars and
art lovers know where they belong,'' <PERSON>Constance Lowenthal</PERSON>, executive
director of the <ORGANIZATION>International Foundation for Art Research</ORGANIZATION>, said
<DATE>Sunday</DATE>.
   The theft occurred around <TIME>1 a.m.</TIME> <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, when two men apparently
convinced museum guards they were police, then bound them with tape
and made their way to the museum's Dutch room.
   It was seven hours before a cleaning crew discovered the theft.
   The heist was ``a professional job,'' said <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON>Paul
Cavanagh</PERSON>. ``This is one of those thefts where people actually spent
some time researching and took specific things.''
   He said the investigation would not be limited to the <LOCATION>United
States</LOCATION>.
   ``It is the biggest Old Master theft in this country, by far,''
said <PERSON>Ms. Lowenthal</PERSON>, whose organization tracks art thefts.
   ``The <ORGANIZATION>Gardner Museum</ORGANIZATION> is a treasure house,'' she said.
``Everything in it is exceedingly valuable and first-rate and
superb.''
   The value of the missing works, which included an ancient
Chinese beaker, was in the hundreds of <MONEY>millions of dollars</MONEY>, said
<PERSON>Karen Haas</PERSON>, the museum's curator. The police report gave the value
as at least <MONEY>$100 million</MONEY>.
   ``It's not overstating the case to say that these are priceless
works,'' said <PERSON>William Robinson</PERSON>, curator of drawings for <ORGANIZATION>Harvard
University</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Fogg Art Museum</ORGANIZATION>. ``A loss of any of these works is
significant.''
   But their true value cannot be determined because they have not
been on the market for nearly a century.
   The works taken were:
   _ ``The Concert'' by <PERSON>Jan Vermeer</PERSON>.
   _ ``A Lady and A Gentleman in Black,'' ``The Storm on the Sea of
<LOCATION>Galilee</LOCATION>,'' and a self-portrait by <ORGANIZATION>Rembrandt</ORGANIZATION>.
   _ ``Landscape with an Obelisk,'' by <PERSON>Govaert Flinck</PERSON>, another
17th-century Dutchman.
   _ ``Leaving the Paddock,'' ``Procession Outside <LOCATION>Florence</LOCATION>,''
``Three Mounted Jockeys,'' ``Program for an Artistic Soiree,'' and
another, less complete work by the same name, by <PERSON>Edgar Degas</PERSON>.
   _ ``At <ORGANIZATION>Tortoni</ORGANIZATION>'s,'' by <PERSON>Edouard Manet</PERSON>.
   _ A Chinese bronze beaker from the <ORGANIZATION>Shang Dynasty</ORGANIZATION>, 1,200-1,100
B.C.
   The Rembrandt self-portrait and ``The Storm on the Sea of
<LOCATION>Galilee</LOCATION>,'' the artist's only seascape, were especially important,
<PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> said.
   He said the theft of the <ORGANIZATION>Vermeer</ORGANIZATION> also was a major loss because
only about 35 of his works are known to exist.
   Experts said the motive for stealing such well-known pieces
could be ransom or acquisitiveness by a selfish, wealthy art lover.
   ``You hear legends of deranged collectors. But, mostly, I think
it's the stuff of spy novels,'' said <PERSON>Peter Sutton</PERSON>, curator of
European paintings at the nearby Museum of Fine Arts.
   <ORGANIZATION>Gardner Museum</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>Corey Cronin</PERSON> refused to say whether the
works were insured.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Gardner Museum</ORGANIZATION>, which sits along the graceful green parkway
called the <LOCATION>Fenway</LOCATION>, has a state-of-the-art security system, and had
two security guards on duty at the time of the theft, <PERSON>Cronin</PERSON> said.
   He said no apparent damage was done to the museum, a four-story
building with a courtyard and a skylight.
   The museum was built to house the collection of the woman whose
name it bears, the widow of <PERSON>John Lowell Gardner</PERSON>, the wealthy son of
the last of <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>East India</LOCATION> merchants.
   <PERSON>Mrs. Gardner</PERSON> lived on the top floor of the mansion until her
death in <DATE>1924</DATE> at age 85. But she opened her home and its collection
to the public long before then, in <DATE>1903</DATE>.
   The museum collection contains 290 paintings, 280 pieces of
sculpture and various religious objects, period furniture,
textiles, ceramics and documents and books by famous writers and
political figures.
   The last major reported theft involving a musuem occurred in
<LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> on <DATE>June 1</DATE>, when a <PERSON>Georges Braque</PERSON> worth an estimated <MONEY>$3
million</MONEY> was taken from the <ORGANIZATION>National Museum of Modern</ORGANIZATION> Art at the
<ORGANIZATION>Pompidou Center</ORGANIZATION>.

   Three years after the original <DATE>1904</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>Walters Art

   The renovation has created for <PERSON>Walters</PERSON>' precious jewels,
bronzes, paintings and sculpture _ what gallery director <PERSON>Robert P.
Bergman</PERSON> calls a ``seamless museum environment'' that is easy on the
eye and alluring even to those not trained in art history.
   ``In a lot of ways, we think the public is going to see the
collection for the first time,'' <PERSON>Bergman</PERSON> said recently, pointing
proudly to carefully concealed display spotlights designed to lure
viewers. ``We direct people directly to the object through the
lighting.''
   The massive stone building with a marble-columned court
fashioned after the 17th-century <ORGANIZATION>Palazzo Balbi</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Genoa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>, is
one of six comprehensive museums in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>. Walters
bequeathed it to the city upon his death in <DATE>1931</DATE>, along with the
22,000-piece collection.
   The leaking roof, blackened marble, drab painted walls and
poorly lighted rooms <PERSON>Bergman</PERSON> inherited when he left an art history
post at <ORGANIZATION>Harvard University</ORGANIZATION> and arrived here are gone. In their
place stands a pristine and colorful complex of rooms featuring
gleaming stone; rich, silk moire; red, blue and gold cotton damask;
polished woods, glass, lucite and plaster. The works themselves
were carefully conserved to bring out colors and features hidden
for centuries.
   The renovated gallery holds some of the 30,000-object collection
spanning 5,000 years of history. A <DATE>1974</DATE> addition that stayed open
during the renovation holds many of the works, while thousands more
lie in storage.
   <PERSON>Walters</PERSON>, who made his fortune with the <ORGANIZATION>Atlantic Coast Line
Railroad</ORGANIZATION>, left the collection _ along with a <MONEY>$3 million</MONEY> endowment _
to his native city ``for the benefit of the people.''
   The works include such masterpieces as one of three surviving
14th-century Italian perspective paintings called ``View of an
Ideal City,'' an early life-size Italian crucifix from the school
of <ORGANIZATION>Cimabue</ORGANIZATION>, the first <PERSON>Raphael Madonna</PERSON> to come to <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> and one of
only 12 known paintings by <ORGANIZATION>Hugo Van Der Goes</ORGANIZATION>.
   Now, however, their future is assured by a climate and
light-controlled environment that is so high-tech that special
louvers regulate the amount of natural light let in by skylights,
and storage spaces for metal works vent outside to prevent
oxidation from destroying other valuable pieces.
   Bergman jokingly calls the project a ``modest calling.''
   ``We wanted to create the finest facility possible for this
collection of <ORGANIZATION>Renaissance</ORGANIZATION>, Baroque and 18th-century paintings and
sculpture and decorative arts,'' he said.
   ``To do that was a special project. The building is a work of
art. We had to respect at every turn the character of this landmark
structure,'' said the medievalist who moved from the rarified
atmosphere of art history theory to a comfortable position as
ceaseless champion of his world-class museum.
   Bergman is satisfied with the effort, financed with <MONEY>$1 million</MONEY>
in city funds, <MONEY>$1 million</MONEY> in state funds and another <MONEY>$4 million</MONEY> in
contributions. In fact, he considers the workmanship he got for the
money a bargain, pointing out how the wood in new doorways matches
original woods and marble-painted sculpture bases mimic the marble
columns for a consistent look.
   Going room to room, <PERSON>Bergman</PERSON> marvels at the miraculously
preserved royal jewel cabinet in wax and wood made for <PERSON>Marie
Antoinette</PERSON>; a collection of European porcelains considered second
only to the British royal collection at <LOCATION>Windsor Castle</LOCATION>; and some of
the nearly 1,000 pieces of jewelry spanning the styles from ancient
<LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION> to art nouveau.
   The installation includes a 19th-century alcove modeled on a
French goldsmith's shop for <PERSON>Walters</PERSON>' delicate Faberge enamels, an
iris corsage ornament created by <ORGANIZATION>Tiffany and Co.</ORGANIZATION> and an ivory
orchid comb by <ORGANIZATION>Lalique</ORGANIZATION>.
   The gallery went up between <DATE>1904</DATE> and <DATE>1909</DATE>, and before <PERSON>Walters</PERSON>'
death, he would open the doors a few times a month, charge
admission and donate the proceeds to charity just as his father,
who began the collection, had done.
   More recently, the gallery has been drawing 150,000 to 200,000
visitors a year, including 1,500 museum members who celebrated the
official opening on <DATE>May 15</DATE>. The first visitors to the reopened
gallery included former employees as well as local visitors
seasoned by a lifetime of trips.
   One after another, they stopped <PERSON>Bergman</PERSON> to thank him for
restoring the collection to splendor.
   ``Just hearing these people convinces me we did the right
thing,'' he said.
