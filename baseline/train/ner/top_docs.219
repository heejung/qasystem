  [Text] <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>, <DATE>Jan. 12</DATE> KYODO -- Nongovernmental 
organizations (NGOs) will discuss problems resulting from the 
growing world population at a symposium from <DATE>Saturday</DATE> in 
preparation for a <ORGANIZATION>United Nations Conference on Population and 
Development</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Cairo</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>, later this year, organizers said 
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE> [12 <DATE>January</DATE>]. 
  The symposium, which will be held at <ORGANIZATION>Waseda University</ORGANIZATION> in 
<LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>, is co-organized by the "Peoples' Forum <DATE>2001</DATE>," an <ORGANIZATION>NGO</ORGANIZATION> 
umbrella organization, and "<LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s Network for Women and 
Health," which aims at increasing women's representation at the 
<LOCATION>Cairo</LOCATION> conference. 
  Panelists will include <PERSON>Makoto Ato</PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION>Health and 
Welfare Ministry's Institute of Population Problems</ORGANIZATION>, Assistant 
Prof. <PERSON>Chizuko Ueno</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Tokyo University</ORGANIZATION> and representatives of 
the <ORGANIZATION>U.N. Population Fund</ORGANIZATION>. 
  The symposium will adopt an appeal urging the Japanese 
Government to include <ORGANIZATION>NGO</ORGANIZATION> and women representatives in its 
delegation for the <LOCATION>Cairo</LOCATION> conference. The suggestions will be 
submitted to the government-organized "<LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> Wise Men's 
Conference on Population and Development," which will be held on 
<DATE>February 26</DATE> and 27. 
  "Population growth in developing countries is a result of 
environment destruction by developed countries. There the 
Japanese bear responsibility too," said <PERSON>Shunsuke Iwasaki</PERSON>, 
assistant professor at <ORGANIZATION>Tsukuba University</ORGANIZATION> and head of the 
Peoples' Forum <DATE>2001</DATE>. 
  "This problem is not that simple that it could be solved by 
just providing means for birth control. As the <LOCATION>Cairo</LOCATION> conference 
is drawing closer, we want to make the first step to give 
ordinary people a say (in these matters)," <PERSON>Iwasaki</PERSON> said in 
explaining the objectives of the symposium. 
  The <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> holds its international <ORGANIZATION>Conference on Population 
and 
Development</ORGANIZATION> every ten years. This year's conference, from 
<DATE>September 5</DATE> to 13, will adopt an action program seeking to 
establish a sustainable balance between the soaring population, 
scarce resources and an increasingly damaged environment. 
  The <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> estimates that the world population will grow by a 
record 93 million to over 5.7 billion in <DATE>1994</DATE>, with the majority 
of the growth occurring in developing countries.

  [Text] <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>, <DATE>Jan. 27</DATE> KYODO -- A <ORGANIZATION>United Nations-sponsored</ORGANIZATION> 
meeting on population and development concluded <DATE>Thursday</DATE> [27 
<DATE>January</DATE>] with a declaration urging governments to curb 
population growth. 
  The two-day conference was held at the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations 
University</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>. 
  "Population growth is a major obstacle to the alleviation of 
poverty, sustained socioeconomic development, and the 
improvement of the status of women," said the draft text of the 
<LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> declaration of the meeting of eminent persons on 
population and development. 
  The meeting, also sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION>Foreign Ministry</ORGANIZATION>, was 
held 
in preparation for the <ORGANIZATION>International Conference on Population 
and Development</ORGANIZATION> (<ORGANIZATION>ICPD</ORGANIZATION>) slated for <DATE>September</DATE> in <LOCATION>Cairo</LOCATION>. 
  "We...call upon all governments and intergovernmental and 
nongovernmental organizations to do their utmost to make the 
(<LOCATION>Cairo</LOCATION>) conference a milestone in the global effort to eradicate 
poverty and socioeconomic inequality, to achieve sustained 
economic growth and sustainable development, to improve the 
status and role of women and to reduce population growth," it 
said. 
  The <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION> has predicted the world population, now 
at 
<MONEY>5.6 billion</MONEY>, will increase to 10 billion by <DATE>2050</DATE>. 
  The declaration urged developing countries to integrate 
population issues into national development planning, and 
developed nations to change their patterns of consumption and to 
curb overproduction in order to reduce the impact on the 
environment and on the use of resources. 
  It also urged "the world community...to increase their 
financial commitment to population and related activities in 
developing countries in order to reach the estimated amount of 
approximately <MONEY>13 billion dollars</MONEY>...by the year <DATE>2000</DATE> and 
approximately <MONEY>17 billion dollars</MONEY> by the year <DATE>2015</DATE> annually." 
  At a news conference held immediately after the meeting 
ended, <ORGANIZATION>International Planned Parenthood Federation</ORGANIZATION> President 
<PERSON>Fred Sai</PERSON>, vice chairman of the <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> meeting, said, "one thing 
which has come out here...is that...we have to start addressing 
population issues much more seriously." 
  He said the other point stressed through the discussion was 
the importance of "partnership between the developed and 
developing countries." 
  The news conference was also attended by <PERSON>Nafis Sadik</PERSON>, 
executive director of the <ORGANIZATION>U.N. Population Fund</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>U.N. University 
Rector Heitor Gurgulino de Souza</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>National Population 
Council</ORGANIZATION> Secretary General <PERSON>Maher Mahran</PERSON> [name as received] and 
former Japanese Foreign Minister <PERSON>Taro Nakayama</PERSON>, chairman of the 
gathering. 
  The 14-member panel of the meeting debated sustainable 
development, family planning and the status of women in relation 
to population. 
  The panel also included former <ORGANIZATION>World Bank</ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON>Robert 
McNamara</PERSON>, former Mexican President Miguel de la <PERSON>Madrid Hurtado</PERSON> 
and former <LOCATION>Kiribati</LOCATION> President <PERSON>Jeremia T. Tabai</PERSON>.

  [Text] The contents of a draft report the government plans 
to submit at the <ORGANIZATION>UN "International Conference</ORGANIZATION> on Population and 
Development" (<ORGANIZATION>ICPD</ORGANIZATION>), which is to be held this <DATE>September</DATE> in 
<LOCATION>Cairo</LOCATION>, was revealed on 1 <DATE>March</DATE>. In the report, the government 
touches on such issues as population trends and reduced birth 
rates. Regarding environmental hazards brought about by 
population growth concentrated in particular regions, the 
government concludes that "A high standard of education has 
enabled the nation to overcome such problems rather quickly." 
However, the government completely fails to touch on 
environmental issues which large cities face, such as huge 
amounts of garbage and air pollution. This stance is expected 
to cause a stir, inasmuch as the main theme of the <LOCATION>Cairo</LOCATION> 
conference includes "population, development, and environment." 
  The government's draft report consists of 17 pages of text 
divided into four major sections: 
  1) population trends and future outlook; 
  2) current situation regarding government policies related 
to 
population trends; 
  3) international cooperation regarding population issues; 
and 
  4) summary and conclusion. 
  Seven sets of graphical data, such as that showing trends in 
average lifespans, are also included in the draft report. 
  Regarding problems resulting from population movements 
within 
the nation, the government, in the report, refers to the cases 
of <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Osaka</LOCATION>, and Kyoto as examples. It points out that in 
these cities, "the population began growing in the <DATE>1960</DATE>'s due to 
the development of heavy chemical industries and the urban 
living environment rapidly deteriorated." It adds that the 
nation "was able to proceed with economic development in harmony 
with environmental preservation, after succeeding in overcoming 
population, developmental, and environmental crises rather 
quickly through public support and government efforts." 
  In the report, the government contends that the nation was 
able to overcome such crises due to "an especially high standard 
of education." It adds that "putting emphasis on education and 
the government's effective use of information play an invaluable 
role in international efforts to help developing countries with 
their population problems." 
  In <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> and other major cities, the problem of securing 
garbage disposal sites has become very serious. Nitrogen oxide 
emissions accompanying the sharp increase in automobile traffic 
have led to air pollution. The government fails to take up 
these issues in its draft report. In this regard, an official 
of the <ORGANIZATION>Health and Welfare Ministry</ORGANIZATION> explained: "It is impossible 
to cover all population-related issues, and there is also a 
limit to the report's length." 
  However, greater interest has been shown in developing 
countries concerning air pollution and garbage issues because 
recently, the environment has been deteriorating in these 
countries due to a rapidly growing population concentrated in 
cities.

<HL> Three Billion Day Approaches in Asia And Causes Concern --- China Presses Birth Control; Responses on Global Level Urged at Meeting in Japan </HL>
<SO> </SO>
<CO> FREST </CO>
<DATELINE> TOKYO (AP)  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Seven babies are born every second in <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION>, and the continent may be only days away from reaching three billion inhabitants. 
This is causing some concern in the world's most crowded corner. 

   <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> greeted the prospect with a ceremony and speeches that urged its citizens to keep practicing birth control. 
In <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>, a group of experts gathered to debate the significance of the approaching milestone, its effects on the family and the growing problem of feeding all those people. 

   <PERSON>Takashi Sato</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s minister of agriculture, said <DATE>Friday</DATE> that "excessive population growth will result in shortages of food, resources and energy . . . and environmental destruction beyond national boundaries. 

   "Without global-level responses to the issues of population, food, environment and development," he said, "it would be difficult for the world to welcome a peaceful 21st century." 
<PERSON>Mr. Sato</PERSON> is chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>Asian Forum of Parliamentarians on Population and Development</ORGANIZATION>, which sponsored the conference. 

   In <DATE>July 1987</DATE>, the world's population passed five billion, double the population in <DATE>1950</DATE>. 

   According to <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION> estimates, <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION>'s population will reach three billion on <DATE>Aug. 10</DATE>. 
Asia experts, however, predict the milestone will be reached within days. 

   Prof. <PERSON>Gayl D. Ness</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>University of Michigan</ORGANIZATION>, a sociologist and researcher on Asian population, estimated that <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION>'s population would grow to 3.5 billion by the end of the century -- and to 4.5 billion by the year <DATE>2025</DATE> while the world population reaches 8.2 billion. 

   Rice production will have to increase <PERCENT>50%</PERCENT> by <DATE>2025</DATE> to feed the continent, Prof. <PERSON>Ness</PERSON> said, but great gains already have been registered by farmers in <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Southeast Asia</LOCATION>. 

   The 21st century targets, he said, "are well within the realm of possibility if the agricultural transformation continues; this, of course, requires sensitive government policies." 

   <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION>, said Prof. <PERSON>Ness</PERSON>, has made "substantial progress" in lowering fertility rates, and Asian countries were the first to adopt policies to limit population growth. 

   But he noted disparities between regions of <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION>. 
East Asian countries such as <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>, which has 1.08 billion people, and <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, which has 122 million, have rapidly declining fertility rates. 
But in <LOCATION>South Asia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> is still experiencing <PERCENT>2.08%</PERCENT> annual growth in its current population of 818 million; <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> has <PERCENT>3.45%</PERCENT> growth with 115 million people; and <LOCATION>Bangladesh</LOCATION> has a <PERCENT>2.67%</PERCENT> growth rate from a current base of 110 million, according to <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> figures. 

   "The challenge lies ahead in completing the demographic transition and bringing birth rates down to match the fall in the death rates," Prof. <PERSON>Ness</PERSON> said. 

   He and other panelists were critical of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> for withdrawing money from the <ORGANIZATION>U.N. Fund</ORGANIZATION> for Population Activities because of the fund's support for abortion. 

   The population growth also has caused some social changes. 

   Prof. <PERSON>Toshio Kuroda</PERSON>, director emeritus of <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Institute of Population</ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION>Nihon University</ORGANIZATION>, noted that <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> "expects the family to care for the aged . . . but the family is undergoing tremendous change in <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> with the one-child family." 

   <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>, the world's most populous country, has since the early <DATE>1980s</DATE> limited most families to one child. 
But the limit has been widely flouted in the past two years. 

   In <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION>, Chinese officials heralded the <ORGANIZATION>Day of Three Billion</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> with a ceremony in the <PERSON>Great Hall</PERSON> of the People. They handed out cassette players to 18 family planning workers, doctors and others for "outstanding performance in implementing our population policy." Speakers warned that rapid population growth poses a threat to economic development. Said <PERSON>Hu Keshi</PERSON>, forum vice chairman:
   "We cannot think that we can have more children because of economic development . . . nor can we relax our efforts because of progress in family planning."

  [Text] <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>, <DATE>March 9</DATE> KYODO -- <LOCATION>Shanghai</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Bangkok</LOCATION> will 
be the subject of a three-year study by a group of Japanese 
scientists to help curb environmental destruction in the face of 
<LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION>'s rapidly expanding population, officials of the <ORGANIZATION>Health and 
Welfare Ministry</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> [9 <DATE>March</DATE>]. 
  The study will be launched later this year and will focus on 
the impact of urbanization and population growth on consumption 
of energy, a main source of emissions of carbon dioxide and 
other greenhouse gases believed to cause global warming, the 
officials said. 
  Scientists say the change in climate could ultimately turn 
entire regions into deserts. 
  The team of scientists from the ministry's <ORGANIZATION>Institute of 
Population Problems and Institute of Public Health</ORGANIZATION> hope to 
improve long-term forecasts for greenhouse gas emissions in <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> 
by examining the causes of population growth and the impact of 
rural migration to cities, they said. 
  The group will also look at how global warming affects the 
spread of malaria, they said. 
  The results of the study will be used to draw up population 
and energy conservation policies that could help reduce the 
impact of global warming. 
  The <ORGANIZATION>Environment Agency</ORGANIZATION> will incorporate the findings in its 
"Eco- <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> 21 Plan" and will try to enlist support from other 
Asian countries, the officials said. 
  World population is expected to increase to 6.3 billion by 
the turn of the century from 5.3 billion in <DATE>1990</DATE>. According to 
<ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION> population fund forecasts, it will further swell 
to <MONEY>8.5 billion</MONEY> in <DATE>2025</DATE>, with more than half of the growth 
occurring in <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION>, mainly <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>. 
  Rural migration is likely to continue, raising the portion 
of 
people living in Asian cities from <PERCENT>30 percent</PERCENT> of total 
population to over <PERCENT>50 percent</PERCENT> in <DATE>2020</DATE>. 
  The <ORGANIZATION>National Institute for Environmental Studies</ORGANIZATION> estimates 
that <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION>'s energy consumption will show annual growth rates of 
<PERCENT>3.2 percent</PERCENT>, far outstripping the world average of <PERCENT>1.6 percent</PERCENT>.

   Rice production will have to increase <PERCENT>50 percent</PERCENT> by <DATE>2025</DATE> to feed
the continent, <PERSON>Ness</PERSON> said, but great gains already have been
registered by farmers in <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Southeast Asia</LOCATION>.
   The 21st century targets ``are well within the realm of
possibility if the agricultural transformation continues. This, of
course, requires sensitive government policies,'' said the
sociologist and researcher on Asian population.
   <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> has made ``substantial progress'' in lowering fertility
rates, and Asian countries were the first to adopt policies to
limit population growth, he said.
   But Ness noted disparities in different regions of <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION>. East
Asian countries such as <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, which has 122 million
people, have rapidly declining fertility rates.
   But in <LOCATION>South Asia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> is still experiencing <PERCENT>2.08 percent</PERCENT>
annual growth in its population of 818 million; <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> has <PERCENT>3.45
percent</PERCENT> growth with 115 million people; and <LOCATION>Bangladesh</LOCATION> has <PERCENT>2.67
percent</PERCENT> growth rate from a current base of 110 million, according
to <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> figures.
   ``The challenge lies ahead in completing the demographic
transition and bringing birth rates down to match the fall in the
death rates,'' <PERSON>Ness</PERSON> said.
   He and other panelists were critical of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> for
withdrawing money from the <ORGANIZATION>U.N. Fund</ORGANIZATION> for Population Activities
because of the fund's support for abortion.
   The population growth also has caused some social changes.
   Professor <PERSON>Toshio Kuroda</PERSON>, director emeritus of <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Institute
of Population</ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION>Nihon University</ORGANIZATION>, noted that <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> ``expects the
family to care for the aged ... but the family is undergoing
tremendous change in <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> with the one-child family.''
   <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>, the world's most populous country with 1.08 billion
people, has since the early <DATE>1980s</DATE> limited most families to one
child. But the limit has been widely flouted in the past two years.
   In <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION>, Chinese officials marked the Day of 3 Billion In
<LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> with a ceremony in the <PERSON>Great Hall</PERSON> of the People.
   They handed out cassette players to 18 family planning workers,
doctors and others for ``outstanding performance in implementing
our population policy.''
   Speakers warned that rapid population growth poses a threat to
economic development.
   ``We cannot think that we can have more children because of
economic development ... nor can we relax our efforts because of
progress in family planning,'' said <PERSON>Hu Keshi</PERSON>, forum vice chairman.

  [Text] <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>, <DATE>May 4</DATE> KYODO -- <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s young population 
declined further to total 20.59 million children under the age 
of 15 as of <DATE>April 1</DATE>, down 500,000 from a year ago, the 
<ORGANIZATION>Management and Coordination Agency</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> [4 May], a day 
before <DATE>Children's Day</DATE>. As of <DATE>April 1 this year</DATE>, children 
accounted for <PERCENT>16.5 percent</PERCENT> of the nation's 125 million 
population, down 0.4 percentage points from the previous year, 
the agency said. 
  Since <DATE>1975</DATE>, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> has witnessed a steady decline in its 
population of children, a trend often referred to as <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s 
aging society. 
  The largest portion of the nation's children, some 1.62 
million, are already teenagers aged 14. Reflecting the 
declining birth rate over the <DATE>last decade</DATE>, the younger the 
child, the fewer peers in his age group. 
  About 1.2 million children belong to each age group between 
1 
and 4. Children under 1 year old numbered 1.19 million. 
  <LOCATION>Okinawa Prefecture</LOCATION> was <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s "youngest" prefecture with 
more than one in five persons, or <PERCENT>22.8 percent</PERCENT>, under 15, 
according to statistics as of <DATE>October 1, 1993</DATE>. Following were 
<ORGANIZATION>Saga Prefecture</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Miyazaki Prefecture</LOCATION> with <PERCENT>18.9 percent</PERCENT> each. 
  In contrast, <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> with more than 11 million inhabitants had 
the lowest share of children with some <PERCENT>13.9 percent</PERCENT>. A slightly 
higher percentage of young people were living in <LOCATION>Toyama</LOCATION> 
prefecture, with <PERCENT>15.8 percent</PERCENT>, and <LOCATION>Kanagawa Prefecture</LOCATION>, with 
<PERCENT>15.9 percent</PERCENT>. 
  In all 47 prefectures, the share of children was lower than 
the previous year. 
  Compared with other aging industrialized nations, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> came 
third after <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>, where children under 15 accounted 
for <PERCENT>16.3 percent</PERCENT> of the national populations, based on <DATE>1991</DATE> and 
<DATE>1992</DATE> surveys, respectively.

  [Text] <LOCATION>Sapporo</LOCATION>, <DATE>April 5</DATE> KYODO -- Most of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s minority 
Ainu remain dissatisfied with their standard of living, 
according to a survey released by the prefectural government on 
<ORGANIZATION>Hokkaido</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s northernmost main island. The survey showed 
that <PERCENT>33 percent</PERCENT> of the Ainu families interviewed on <ORGANIZATION>Hokkaido</ORGANIZATION> 
said they find it "tough" to make ends meet, while another <PERCENT>44 
percent</PERCENT> opted to characterize it as "somewhat difficult." 
  A total of 300 Ainu families in <LOCATION>Hokkaido</LOCATION>, where most of 
<LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s Ainu live, were interviewed last <DATE>June</DATE> for the survey, 
which has been conducted every seven years since <DATE>1972</DATE>. Despite 
complaints about difficulties in earning a livelihood, the 
survey showed that ratio of Ainu receiving welfare payments from 
the government fell from 60.9 per 1,000 population in the last 
survey, undertaken in <DATE>1986</DATE>, to 38.8 per 1,000 population in the 
current survey. 
  The survey said <ORGANIZATION>Hokkaido</ORGANIZATION>'s Ainu population stood at 23,830, 
or a decrease of 551 over the last survey. 
  There are few remaining full-blooded Ainu in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>. Counted 
as <ORGANIZATION>Ainu</ORGANIZATION> in the survey were those thought to have at least some 
Ainu blood or those living in families with members who have 
Ainu blood. 
  The survey said the percentage of Ainu children going on to 
senior high school increased by 9 points to <PERCENT>87.4 percent</PERCENT>, though 
it fell short of the <PERCENT>96.3 percent</PERCENT> overall figure for Hokkaido 
children. A bigger gap surfaced in the figures for those 
children proceeding to university or college, with <PERCENT>11.8 percent</PERCENT> 
for the relevant Ainu population compared with <PERCENT>27.5 percent</PERCENT> for 
the overall population. 
  In a questionnaire targeting Ainu aged 15 and older, only 
<PERCENT>7.3 
percent</PERCENT> said they faced incidences of discrimination over the 
past six or seven years, while <PERCENT>62 percent</PERCENT> said they had not. 
  Officials said the <ORGANIZATION>Hokkaido Prefectural Government</ORGANIZATION> intends 
to 
use the survey in planning its future Ainu welfare policies.

   The population of <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> has reached three billion, according to a report released by a group of politicians representing 19 Asian nations. 

   The Asian Forum of Parliamentarians on <ORGANIZATION>Population and Development</ORGANIZATION> report, based on data compiled by the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION>, said this mark was reached at <TIME>47 minutes after midnight</TIME> <LOCATION>Greenwhich</LOCATION> Mean Time yesterday. 

   <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION>, the world's most populous region, accounts for <PERCENT>60%</PERCENT> of the total global population, which passed the five billion mark in <DATE>July 1987</DATE>. 
Seven babies are born in <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> every second -- or 150,000 each day, the report said. 

   The forum, headed by <PERSON>Takashi Sato</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s Agriculture Minister, issued the report at an international conference in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> <DATE>last month</DATE>, heralding the Day of the <ORGANIZATION>Three Billion</ORGANIZATION>. 
The forum includes 19 Asian nations from <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Syria</LOCATION>. 

   "The designation of a day marking the birth of the three-billionth baby in <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> is very symbolic," <PERSON>Shigemi Kono</PERSON>, director general of the <ORGANIZATION>National Institute of Population Problems</ORGANIZATION>, said. 
"But I personally think it is nonsense, because there is no way of actually knowing when the three-billionth baby was born." 

   Skepticism about calculations aside, however, <PERSON>Mr. Kono</PERSON> agrees there are serious population problems in the region. 

   "Though we have come close to solving the fertility rate problem in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>, serious questions remain in <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Bangladesh</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>," he said. 

   <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>, with a population of 818 million, has an annual growth rate of <PERCENT>2.08%</PERCENT>. 
The rate in <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>, with a population of 115 million, is <PERCENT>3.45%</PERCENT>, and in <LOCATION>Bangladesh</LOCATION>, with 110 million people, it is <PERCENT>2.67%</PERCENT>, according to <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> estimates. 

   By the <DATE>year 2025</DATE>, <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> will have 4.5 billion inhabitants, said an official with the nonprofit, <ORGANIZATION>Tokyo-based Asian Population and Development Association</ORGANIZATION>. 
The estimated growth in <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> is roughly equal to the increase in the total world population from <DATE>1950</DATE> to <DATE>1980</DATE>, she added. 

   Specialists have predicted that rice production will have to increase <PERCENT>50%</PERCENT> by <DATE>2025</DATE> to feed the continent.

  [Text] <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION>, <DATE>March 4</DATE> (XINHUA) -- The 10th Asian 
Parliamentarians' Meeting on Population and Development (APPD) 
closed here today. 
  The meeting has further promoted mutual understanding and 
friendship among the participants from 15 countries including 
<LOCATION>China</LOCATION> after their discussions on issues of population and 
development and women's position and role. 
  <PERSON>Fukusaburo Maeda</PERSON>, chairman of the Asian population and 
development association, described the two-day meeting as 
significant. 
  He said that in <DATE>September this year</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>Third International 
Conference on Population and Development</ORGANIZATION> will be held in <LOCATION>Cairo</LOCATION>, 
at which a policy on population is expected to be approved. 
  He expressed the hope that this policy will become a program 
for actions of all countries in the next 20 years. 
  <PERSON>Hao Yichun</PERSON>, deputy head of the delegation of <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>'s 
<ORGANIZATION>National 
People's Congress</ORGANIZATION> (NPC) and vice-chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>NPC Education</ORGANIZATION>, 
Science, Culture and <ORGANIZATION>Public Health Committee</ORGANIZATION>, said with the 
common efforts by the Asian parliamentarians, the meeting has 
achieved a complete success. 
  Noting that <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> is the most populous region in the world, 
<PERSON>Hao</PERSON> said the solution of the Asian population problem will be of 
great importance to peace, prosperity and development of <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> 
and the rest of the world. 
  She said many Asian countries have already adopted proper 
measures to reduce the birth rate and have achieved significant 
results. 
  However, <PERSON>Hao</PERSON> said the trend of rapid population growth has 
not yet been checked and the task of improving the quality of 
human resources is still arduous. 
  The solution of population problems requires the common 
efforts from Asian parliaments, governments, non-governmental 
organizations as well as the people from every Asian country, 
she added. 
  After the meeting <PERSON>Fukusaburo Maeda</PERSON> and leaders from the 
Asian 
forum and the <ORGANIZATION>UN Population Fund</ORGANIZATION> gave a press conference and 
answered questions on cooperation between <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>UN

  [Text] <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>, <DATE>Dec. 31</DATE> KYODO -- Despite a wedding every 40 
seconds, fewer babies than ever were born in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> in <DATE>1993</DATE> and a 
record number of couples ended up in divorces, the <ORGANIZATION>Health and 
Welfare Ministry</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>Friday</DATE> [31 <DATE>December</DATE>]. 
  With 9.6 babies born per thousand people the birth rate hit 
a 
historic low. The number of births fell by 24,000 to 1.19 
million, sinking below the 1.2 million mark for the first time, 
the ministry said in announcing the estimate for this year. 
  The statistics were projected for the whole calendar year 
based on the number of births, deaths, marriages, and divorces 
registered between <DATE>January 1</DATE> and <DATE>October 31</DATE>. 
  The low birth rate is expected to further reduce the 
fertility rate, which represents the average number of children 
a woman gives birth to in her life, from its all-time low last 
year of 1.5 children, officials said. To maintain the current 
population over the long run the rate must be 2.1 or above. 
  Apparently sparked by the <DATE>June</DATE> wedding between <PERSON>Crown Prince 
Naruhito</PERSON> and <PERSON>Masako Owada</PERSON>, 38,000 more couples tied the knot 
than in <DATE>1992</DATE>. The number of marriages has been continuously on 
the rise over the <DATE>last six years</DATE>, reaching 792,000 in <DATE>1993</DATE>. 
  The wedding fever was especially strong in <DATE>June</DATE>, which saw 
an 
increase by 10,000 marriages over last year. On <DATE>June 9</DATE> alone, 
the day of the royal wedding, 13,000 couples started married 
life. However, the country also experienced a second divorce 
boom following a first peak in <DATE>1983</DATE>. After a continued rise 
over the <DATE>last three years</DATE>, divorces peaked at 189,000, an 
all-time high. Some 10,000 more couples decided to separate than 
last year, amounting to a divorce every 2 minutes 47 seconds. 
  While births still outstripped deaths, the natural 
population 
increase further slowed to an all-time low 302,000 people, 
50,000 less than in <DATE>1992</DATE>. Partly due to an influenza epidemic 
in <DATE>January</DATE> and <DATE>February</DATE>, deaths soared by 26,000 to a record 
883,000. 
  As to the causes of death, cancer ranked top with 237,000 
cases, followed by 183,000 deaths resulting from heart diseases, 
and some 120,000 people dying from cerebrovascular diseases. 
The pattern remained unchanged since <DATE>1985</DATE>.

  [Text] <LOCATION>Omiya</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, <DATE>June 22</DATE> KYODO -- Representatives from 
16 countries in the <LOCATION>Asia-Pacific</LOCATION> region ended a two-day 
environmental meeting <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> [22 <DATE>June</DATE>] with a call for the 
development of sustainable cities and the protection of island 
nations from the effects of global warming. 
  The call was included in a document adopted at the 
environment congress for <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> (Eco <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> `94) in 
<LOCATION>Omiya</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Saitama Prefecture</LOCATION>. 
  Senior officials from 16 governments, including five 
ministers, as well as representatives from eight international 
organizations attended the congress. 
  The congress, the third since <DATE>1991</DATE>, reviewed progress in 
achieving environmentally sustainable development in the region 
since the <ORGANIZATION>U.N. Conference on Environment and Development</ORGANIZATION> 
(<ORGANIZATION>UNCED</ORGANIZATION>), otherwise known as the earth summit, in <LOCATION>Rio de Janeiro</LOCATION> 
in <DATE>June 1992</DATE>. 
  The document, issued in the name of the conference 
chairwoman, Environment Agency Director General <PERSON>Toshiko 
Hamayotsu</PERSON>, said the region needs to shift from theoretical 
considerations to "concerted political and practical actions, 
international cooperation, and sufficient institutional and 
capacity building." 
  Countries represented at the congress are home to more than 
half the world's population, with millions of people 
concentrated in rapidly growing cities. 
  The document notes the concern of delegates over pollution 
and urban crowding in the region caused by rapid economic 
development at the expense of the environment. 
  It urges, for the first time at an <LOCATION>Eco Asia</LOCATION> meeting, the 
development of the concept of sustainable cities. 
  It also calls for developed countries to "change their mass 
consumption lifestyles, provide support for realization of 
sustainable development in developing countries and prevent the 
export of pollution." 
  "Solid waste disposal has become a critical issue in this 
region," the document says. 
  The document also incorporates a call made <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> by 
Indonesian Environment Minister <PERSON>Sarwono Kusumaatmaja</PERSON> to "tackle 
the problems" of small island states. 
  <LOCATION>Indonesia</LOCATION> and a number of other Pacific nations incorporate 
thousands of small, low-lying islands which could be threatened 
if global warming causes a rise in sea levels. 
  Although many delegates favored establishment of an <LOCATION>Eco Asia</LOCATION> 
secretariat in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, opinion was not unanimous and the document 
merely calls for "development mechanisms for smooth and 
effective implementation of <LOCATION>Eco Asia</LOCATION> activities." 
  Malaysian Environment Minister <PERSON>Hieng Ding Law</PERSON>, who served as 
congress co-chairman, told a press conference after the congress 
that there was "a general feeling that Eco <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> should continue." 
  "It is high time <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> should play a more significant role 
in 
implementing <ORGANIZATION>UNCED</ORGANIZATION>," Law said. "It is important to have a 
secretariat and a data bank."

  [Text] <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>, <DATE>May 31</DATE> KYODO -- A Japanese Government 
advisory panel on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> [31 <DATE>May</DATE>] proposed a three-stage scheme 
to build a nationwide optical-fiber telecommunications network 
by <DATE>2010</DATE> as part of efforts to facilitate the shift to an 
information-oriented society in the next century. 
  The scheme would create jobs for 2.43 million people by 
boosting <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s multimedia market by <MONEY>56 trillion yen</MONEY> to <MONEY>123 
trillion yen</MONEY> by the targeted year, said the <ORGANIZATION>Telecommunications 
Council</ORGANIZATION>, an advisory body to the posts minister. 
  The council said the telecom project would help correct the 
over- centralization of information in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>, quicken economic 
restructuring in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> through the creation of new business and 
expand leisure time of the Japanese people as a result of an 
expected diffusion of "satellite" remote offices. 
  The scheme is also designed for the efficient use of natural 
resources and energy, contributing to a solution of 
environmental issues, one of the biggest global problems toward 
the <DATE>21st century</DATE>. 
  In the recommendation presented to Posts and 
Telecommunications Minister <PERSON>Katsuyuki Hikasa</PERSON>, the council called 
for the laying of a core optical-cable network linking the 
prefectural capitals by <DATE>2000</DATE>, in a first-phase project that 
would cover <PERCENT>20 percent</PERCENT> of the nation's population. 
  A second-stage network should be built by <DATE>2005</DATE> to connect 
cities with populations of over 100,000 for a population 
coverage of <PERCENT>60 percent</PERCENT>, the council said. 
  Nationwide hookup is set for the year of <DATE>2010</DATE> when <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s 
population is expected to peak, it said. 
  Apart from the three-stage scheme, an optical cable network 
to link major public organs, like schools, libraries, hospitals 
and welfare facilities, should be built by <DATE>2000</DATE>, accompanied by 
the development of application software for use at such 
institutions, the council said. 
  "Based on the council proposal, the posts ministry will push 
for various measures to implement the program, including further 
deregulation in telecom fields and an ample amount of budgetary 
allocation by the <ORGANIZATION>Finance Ministry</ORGANIZATION>, an official at the posts 
ministry told a press conference. 
  <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>'s proposal has been apparently prompted by "the 
information superhighway scheme" unveiled earlier by the <LOCATION>United 
States</LOCATION>. 
  As under the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> scheme, the Japanese project is expected 
to 
provide a wide range of multimedia services in the next century, 
which the council says would make Japanese people's livelihood 
"dramatically more comfortable." 
  As possible multimedia services under the scheme, the 
council 
cited remote medical checking, video-on-demand services, home 
shopping, electronic libraries, virtual reality leisure parks, 
interactive access to administrative information and remote 
education services. 
  The proposed optical-fiber network is projected to cost <MONEY>53 
trillion yen</MONEY> when the single-star (SS) system, the most 
sophisticated optical cable networking method, is used at 
subscribing companies and households, the council said. 
  The cost would be lower at <MONEY>33 trillion yen</MONEY> if networking is 
done with a combination of the SS system and a less 
sophisticated system, a more practical approach in view of 
<LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s current technological level. 
  The council said the private sector should play a key role 
in 
developing related application software. But government support 
is also necessary in the inititial stage of networking that 
focuses on infrastructure improvement. 
  The task of laying the core part of the fiber cable network 
should be basically entrusted to either telecommunications 
companies like <ORGANIZATION>Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp.</ORGANIZATION> (NTT) or 
cable television operators, the council said. 
  The posts ministry official avoided stating a specific role 
by <ORGANIZATION>NTT</ORGANIZATION> in the fiber project, noting that further discussion 
needs to be conducted to decide who should take charge of the 
task. 
  "To create a business environment that maximizes competition 
among various sectors would eventually serve the interest of 
general users," the council said. 
  It said interest-free loans and tax incentives should be 
provided to entities participating in costly infrastructure 
improvement projects in the scheme. 
  The optical-fiber network scheme is most likely to produce 
various social, legal and security problems that the Japanese 
people have rarely experienced in the past -- those uniquely 
inherent in the nature of multimedia services. 
  Among them are an unintended violation of individual privacy 
and intellectual property rights. The legal framework should be 
upgraded to cope with these problems, the council said. 
  The council also called for the standardization of telecom 
equipment and systems in accordance with international standards. 
  The concept of "universal services" should be introduced for 
the new telecom scheme, in which services are equally offered 
across the nation at reasonable prices, the council said.

  [Text] <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>, <DATE>Jan. 20</DATE> KYODO -- The consumption tax may be 
renamed the "welfare tax" in a bid to win public support for 
raising it, government sources said <DATE>Thursday</DATE> [20 <DATE>January</DATE>]. 
  The issue has been deliberated within government circles for 
some time, the sources said. 
  The governing coalition has been under pressure to clarify 
the purpose of the tax in light of the rapid aging of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s 
population, they said. 
  It is also being argued that a name change could help win 
support for raising the current rate from <PERCENT>3 percent</PERCENT>, a move that 
is strongly opposed by the <ORGANIZATION>Social Democratic Party</ORGANIZATION> [of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>], 
the largest party in Prime Minister <PERSON>Morihiro Hosokawa</PERSON>'s 
coalition government. 
  The idea has met with criticism from some people engaged in 
various welfare programs, who fear that the amount of tax 
collected under that name might be regarded as a ceiling for 
welfare spending.

  [Text] <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>, <DATE>March 8</DATE> KYODO -- <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> will host a 
17-nation AIDS summit in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> in <DATE>November</DATE> because the AIDS 
epidemic is now too serious to leave to medical experts alone, 
an emissary for the French health minister said <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> [8 
<DATE>March</DATE>] in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>. 
  Jean <PERSON>Francois Girard</PERSON>, director general of health in the 
<ORGANIZATION>French Ministry of Social Affairs</ORGANIZATION>, Health and <LOCATION>City</LOCATION>, told a news 
conference that the one-day summit will bring together heads of 
at least 17 nations to consider ways to fight the AIDS epidemic 
on a global level. 
  "Till now, health problems have been treated by doctors, but 
AIDS is too serious to be treated only by doctors," <PERSON>Girard</PERSON> said. 
  "For the first time in the history of the world, heads of 
government will be considering a health problem. It will be a 
historic turning point." 
  Girard visited the <ORGANIZATION>Health and Welfare Ministry</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Monday</DATE> and 
the <ORGANIZATION>Foreign Ministry</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> to explain the goals and solicit 
participation. 
  He said the 17 countries to be invited include those whose 
contribution to the international fight against AIDS is the 
greatest. Among them are <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, 
<LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION>, the Scandinavian countries and the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>. 
  He said <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION> Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali 
has indicated he would like to attend. 
  <PERSON>Girard</PERSON> said several international organizations, including 
the <ORGANIZATION>World Health Organization</ORGANIZATION> (WHO), the <ORGANIZATION>U.N. Education</ORGANIZATION>, 
Scientific and <ORGANIZATION>Cultural Organization</ORGANIZATION> (<ORGANIZATION>UNESCO</ORGANIZATION>), the <ORGANIZATION>U.N. 
Children</ORGANIZATION>'s Fund (<ORGANIZATION>UNICEF</ORGANIZATION>), the <ORGANIZATION>U.N. Fund</ORGANIZATION> for Population 
Activities (<ORGANIZATION>UNFPA</ORGANIZATION>) and the <ORGANIZATION>World Bank</ORGANIZATION> will have input into 
planning the summit agenda. 
  He said experts in many other AIDS-affected countries who 
are 
not invited will be consulted at the preparatory stage. 
  French Prime Minister <PERSON>Edouard Balladur</PERSON> will chair the 
summit, 
for which no final date has been set. 
  The gathering was originally scheduled for <DATE>June</DATE>, but <PERSON>Girard</PERSON> 
said it was postponed because many heads of state could not come 
in <DATE>June</DATE> and because <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> will host an international meeting of 
AIDS experts, including doctors, researchers, and AIDS 
sufferers, in <LOCATION>Yokohama</LOCATION> in <DATE>August</DATE>. 
  About 10,000 people from more than 140 countries, including 
some 1,000 AIDS patients and carriers of the AIDS-causing human 
immunodeficiency virus, are expected to attend the <LOCATION>Yokohama</LOCATION> 
meeting. 
  <PERSON>Girard</PERSON> said the <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> AIDS summit will be able to capitalize 
on decisions made at the <LOCATION>Yokohama</LOCATION> conference.

  The two countries will also cooperate in developing

  [Text] The <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> of Representatives overwhelmingly 
approved a bill <DATE>Thursday</DATE> [23 <DATE>June</DATE>] to reduce the current 6.5 to 
1 disparity in the weight of a vote in various <ORGANIZATION>House of 
Councillors</ORGANIZATION> constituencies to 5 to 1. 
  The <ORGANIZATION>House of Councillors</ORGANIZATION> approved the bill <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>. 
  The amendment bill cleared the lower chamber's plenary 
session with the backing of almost all political parties and 
parliamentary groups except the <ORGANIZATION>Japanese Communist Party</ORGANIZATION>. 
  An upper house poll in the <DATE>summer of 1995</DATE> will be held under 
the new electoral system. 
  The bill adds one seat to each of four underrepresented 
upper 
chamber constituencies in <LOCATION>Miyagi</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Saitama</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kanagawa</LOCATION> and Gifu 
prefectures, while taking away two seats from the 
overrepresented Hokkaido electorate and one each from the 
prefectures of <LOCATION>Hyogo</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Fukuoka</LOCATION>, legislators said. 
  The bill alleviates the current situation under which some 
relatively sparsely populated constituencies have more 
representation in the upper house than more densely populated 
constituencies, mainly in or near urban areas. 
  The amendment was submitted after a <DATE>1993</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>Osaka High Court</ORGANIZATION> 
ruling that the current maximum disparity of 6.48 to 1 violates 
the constitutional principle of equality for all under the law, 
the legislators said. 
  The amendment would reduce the maximum disparity to 4.81 to 
1, they said. 
  The bill was initially introduced in the upper chamber under 
the cosponsorship of the <ORGANIZATION>Liberal Democratic Party</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Social 
Democratic Party</ORGANIZATION> [of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>], Komeito [Clean Government Party], 
the <ORGANIZATION>Niin Club</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Shin Ryokufu Kai</ORGANIZATION> -- a parliamentary group 
comprising the <ORGANIZATION>Democratic Socialist Party</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Japan New Party</ORGANIZATION>, 
<ORGANIZATION>Shinseito</ORGANIZATION> [<ORGANIZATION>Japan Renewal Party</ORGANIZATION>] and the <ORGANIZATION>Democratic Reform Party</ORGANIZATION>. 
  Goken Liberal No Kai, a five-legislator group of the upper 
chamber, balked at the bill, saying it is not enough to 
accomplish fairness in voting power.

  [Text] <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>, <DATE>April 8</DATE> KYODO -- Kazakh President <PERSON>Nursultan 
Nazarbayev</PERSON> warned <DATE>Friday</DATE> [8 <DATE>April</DATE>] that some leading Russian 
politicians' attempts to stir up nationalistic sentiments among 
Russians residing in <LOCATION>Kazakhstan</LOCATION> and other former Soviet 
republics may trigger an exodus of refugees. 
  "If Russians, Ukrainians and Germans residing in <LOCATION>Kazakhstan</LOCATION> 
took Russian politicians' campaigns at face value and opted to 
move to <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> or other areas, they would plunge into a more 
severe situation than now," <PERSON>Nazarbayev</PERSON> said. 
  "Although such an exodus has not yet begun, my biggest 
anxiety comes from this issue," <PERSON>Nazarbayev</PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION>Japan 
National Press Club</ORGANIZATION> on the final day of his four-day visit to 
<LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>. 
  At present, some 5 million Russians, or more than a quarter 
of <LOCATION>Kazakhstan</LOCATION>'s population, reside in the country which has a 
population of 17 million. Germans and Ukrainians each account 
for some <PERCENT>5 percent</PERCENT> of the populace. Under the 19-century 
colonial policy of <LOCATION>Czarist Russia</LOCATION>, Russians were ordered to move 
to the central Asian country. 
  Nazarbayev accused Russian Foreign Minister <PERSON>Andrey Kozyrev</PERSON> 
and other politicians of having tried to rekindle Russian 
nationalist sentiments in a bid to lure Russian voters during 
<DATE>1993</DATE> parliamentary election campaigns. 
  Kozyrev said <DATE>last November 22</DATE> -- three weeks before the 
parliamentary vote -- that <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> would "protect the Russian 
population and <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION>'s interests in a tough manner, wherever it 
is needed and whoever is concerned, even if it (concerns) our 
friends." 
  "The treatment of official Russian representatives, 
servicemen and our compatriots on the territory of any state, be 
it near or far abroad, is the litmus paper on which good 
neighborly relations with any state will be tested," <PERSON>Kozyrev</PERSON> 
said. 
  <PERSON>Nazarbayev</PERSON> told the press conference, "these Russian 
politicians tried to draw strength from the theme of the 
interests of '<LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION>' in view of the <DATE>December 11</DATE> parliamentary 
election." 
  <PERSON>Nazarbayev</PERSON> said there is no rationale for any calls for an 
exodus of Russians from <LOCATION>Kazakhstan</LOCATION>, as the <ORGANIZATION>Kazakh Government</ORGANIZATION> has 
taken a "policy of providing free plots of land to enable all 
residents to build homes and plow fields," whatever ethnic group 
they may belong to. 
  Nazarbayev refused to comment on press reports that <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> 
and the former <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> bought <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> security secrets from 
alleged <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Central Intelligence Agency</ORGANIZATION> turncoat <PERSON>Aldrich Ames</PERSON> 
over the past eight years for <MONEY>2.5 million dollars</MONEY>. 
  Asked about <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> congressional arguments calling for a halt 
to aid to <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> following the reported espionage case, 
<PERSON>Nazarbayev</PERSON> said, "I am not in a position to give advice to other 
countries on their aid policy to <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION>."

  [Text] <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>, <DATE>Feb. 26</DATE> KYODO -- <PERCENT>Seventy percent</PERCENT> of 300 
single- seat constituencies being set up under new political 
reform bills will be redrawn according to a <DATE>1991</DATE> plan presented 
to then Prime Minister <PERSON>Toshiki Kaifu</PERSON>, according to a survey 
released <DATE>Saturday</DATE> [26 <DATE>February</DATE>]. 
  A KYODO NEWS SERVICE survey of politicians and people 
concerned in 47 prefectures found that more than 200 new 
single-seat districts will be invented according to the draft 
plan. 
  Only 60 to 70 districts, mostly in the densely populated 
Kanto and Kinki regions, will be newly created under legal 
procedures after the expected passage of an amendment of the 
package of political reform bills in early <DATE>March</DATE>. 
  The political reform bills, which were approved in <DATE>January</DATE> 
after a long battle in the Diet, calls for replacing the present 
511 multiseat constituencies for the lower house with a mix of 
300 single-seat constituencies and 200 proportional 
representation seats. 
  In about 45 new single-seat constituencies, the ruling 
coalition parties must single out their candidates since they 
have more than one incumbent lower house member in corresponding 
present multiseat districts. 
  The opposition <ORGANIZATION>LDP</ORGANIZATION>, which was ousted from power last <DATE>August</DATE> 
by the coalition government headed by Prime Minister <PERSON>Morihiro</PERSON> 
hosokawa, must make similar adjustments of their candidates in 
about 35 single-seat districts. 
  Totally new districts in which there are virtually no 
"incumbent" members will come into existence as well, with the 
number of such districts reaching more than 90 for the ruling 
parties and nearly 120 for the <ORGANIZATION>LDP</ORGANIZATION>. 
  The <ORGANIZATION>8th Election System Council</ORGANIZATION>, a government advisory 
council, submitted the draft plan for redrawing electoral 
districts for the lower house in <DATE>June 1991</DATE> to <LOCATION>Kaifu</LOCATION>, then prime 
minister and <ORGANIZATION>LDP</ORGANIZATION> president. 
  In drawing up the 300 single-seat constituencies, the 
council 
set 549,000 as an upper limit for the population of a voting 
district and 274,000 as a lower limit. 
  The population of six of the proposed constituencies will be 
allowed to remain below 274,000 as exceptions. 
  On the council's plan, many of those surveyed complained 
that 
it ignores regional history and geographical conditions, but 
some said another plan would cause problems such as 
contradiction of the weight of vote per voter. 
  Kaifu and his <ORGANIZATION>LDP</ORGANIZATION> successor <PERSON>Kiichi Miyazawa</PERSON> were dislodged 
from power due to their failure to achieve political reform. 
  Kaifu, speaking to the <ORGANIZATION>LDP</ORGANIZATION>'s local convention in <LOCATION>Nagoya</LOCATION>, 
central <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, said <DATE>Saturday</DATE> politicians should not intervene in 
redrawing the single-seat districts. 
  The government "should redraw (the electoral districts) 
fairly by entrusting the task with a third organization," he 
said.

  [Text] <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <DATE>May 24</DATE> KYODO -- <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>United 
States</LOCATION> vowed <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> [24 May] to create a joint health program 
for children to stamp out polio from the face of the world by 
the year <DATE>2000</DATE>. 
  "We believe (this goal) is technically feasible," said 
<ORGANIZATION>Undersecretary of State for Global Affairs Timothy Wirth</ORGANIZATION> in 
announcing the joint program. 
  The program is a new "common agenda" initiative the two 
countries created <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> as part of a year-old bilateral accord 
to promote cooperation on global social and environmental issues. 
  <PERSON>Wirth</PERSON> said the two countries also agreed to pool their aid 
resources and launch a second child health initiative to develop 
an inexpensive, "one-fits-all" children's vaccine to fight 
disease in developing countries. 
  In addition, the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> agreed to expand 
their "common agenda" plan on narcotics control, the protection 
of coral reefs, and the expansion of global changes research in 
<LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Latin America</LOCATION>, the two sides said in a statement 
released after a general meeting of the <ORGANIZATION>U.S.-Japan Common Agenda 
for Global Cooperation</ORGANIZATION>. 
  The "common agenda" program is the least controversial part 
of a highly contentious framework agreement the two countries 
concluded in <DATE>July last year</DATE> to define a "new economic 
partnership" between the two countries. 
  By stepping up bilateral cooperation on global 
social-economic issues while fighting on the trade front, the 
two countries have shown that "you can walk and chew gum at the 
same time," <PERSON>Wirth</PERSON> said. 
  The two countries have not yet worked out details of their 
new child health program, but <PERSON>Wirth</PERSON> said it involves bilateral 
cooperation in research and development, plus production and 
distribution of children's vaccines for use in developing 
countries. 
  "We believe that aggressive cooperation between the two 
countries...can lead to the eradication of polio worldwide by 
the year <DATE>2000</DATE>," <PERSON>Wirth</PERSON> said. 
  Under the "common agenda" program, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>United 
States</LOCATION> have already agreed to pool their resources to control 
global population growth, battle the AIDS epidemic in developing 
countries and promote worldwide environmental projects. 
  A new environmental program approved <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> calls for 
providing financial aid to the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION> to build a 
biodiversity training site at <LOCATION>Subic Bay</LOCATION> to protect lowland rain 
forests. 
  The two countries also pledged to finance a community 
resource conservation and development program in <LOCATION>Papua New 
Guinea</LOCATION> aimed at encouraging tribal clans to preserve endangered 
forests by promoting income alternatives. 
  On the AIDS front, the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> agreed to put 
six countries -- the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Indonesia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ghana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION> 
and <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION> -- on their "priority" lists for a joint U.S.-Japan 
AIDS-fighting assistance program. 
  The two countries have so far pledged to provide up to <MONEY>12 
billion dollars</MONEY> by the year <DATE>2000</DATE> to fight AIDS and control 
exploding population growth in the developing world.

<FÊP=106> [By staff reporter <PERSON>Ma Chenguang</PERSON>: "Asian Family Planning </F>
Urged--Conference Pushes More Regional Cooperation"] 
  [Text] Premier <PERSON>Li Peng</PERSON> yesterday called for greater 
regional cooperation to stem the population tide sweeping across 
<LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> -- home to <PERCENT>60 percent</PERCENT> of the world's populace. 
  He pledged that <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> will continue its efforts at 
population 
control by sticking to its family planing policy; those efforts 
help develop the economy and improve people's daily lives. 
  And other Asian nations should formulate their own 
strategies. But their plans need to be developed according to 
individual characteristics, he said in a written statement to an 
Asian Pacific population seminar. 
  The question of population is a question of development in 
essence, the Premier added, and can only be tackled at its root 
according to each country's natural conditions, tradition and 
economic level. 
  The 10th Asian Parliamentarians Meeting on <ORGANIZATION>Population and 
Development</ORGANIZATION> is seeking solutions to Asian population problems. 
  More than 50 parliamentarians and scholars from 17 nations 
were drawn to the two-day seminar, organized by the <ORGANIZATION>Asian 
Population and Development Association</ORGANIZATION> (<ORGANIZATION>APDA</ORGANIZATION>) based in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> and 
the Education, Science, Culture and <ORGANIZATION>Public Health Committee</ORGANIZATION> 
(ESCPH) of the <ORGANIZATION>National People's Congress</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>. At the 
opening of the meeting, <ORGANIZATION>APDA</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Fukusaburo Maeda</PERSON> said 
controlling <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION>'s population is a decisive global issue. Its 
populace is expected to top 3.34 billion people this year. 
  It has six of the 10 most populated countries in the world: 
<LOCATION>China</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Indonesia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Bangladesh</LOCATION>. 
  Maeda praised <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>'s efforts to contain its birth rate, an 
"unmatched success in population policy while proceeding with 
rapid economic growth." 
  The population by the end of last year was <MONEY>1.18 billion</MONEY>, 
according to the newly published statistics. 
  The birth rate fell from 33.43 per thousand in <DATE>1970</DATE> -- 
before 
family planning -- to 18.09 in <DATE>1993</DATE>. And natural population 
growth has continued its <DATE>fall</DATE>, from 14.55 per thousand in <DATE>1981</DATE> 
down to last years 11.45. 
  Without the policy 15 million more babies would have been 
born over the past five years. 
  <PERSON>Maeda</PERSON> said quick solutions to overpopulation in <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> would 
help ensure domestic stability. 
  Analysts recommended controlling the birth rate eradicating 
poverty, creating sufficient food and job opportunities, 
improving education standards, literacy rates and living 
conditions. 
  Chinese ESCPH Chairman <PERSON>Zhao Dongwan</PERSON> said that the nation's 
ultimate goal is to educate and explain to the people why family 
planning is so important. That way, he said, future generations 
will carry on the practice on their own. 
  He admitted that obstacles to <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>'s development and 
population quality still exist, including economic and social 
development, resource utilization and environmental protection. 
  <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>, by sharing problems of unbalanced population problems 
and socio-economic development with other developing Asian 
countries, needs to strengthen cooperations with them to further 
contain its expansion of population. 
  Also yesterday, <ORGANIZATION>NPC Standing Committee</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Qiao Shi</PERSON>, 
parliamentary leader, met with the Asia-Pacific parliamentarians 
and scholars at the <PERSON>Great Hall</PERSON> of the People.

  [Text] <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <DATE>February 5</DATE> (XINHUA) -- The <ORGANIZATION>U.S. 
Government</ORGANIZATION> is to increase its financial assistance to the 
worldwide population control, official sources said here today. 
  "If we can't stabilize the world's population, we're not 
going to be able to control any other problems," said <ORGANIZATION>State 
Department</ORGANIZATION> Counselor <PERSON>Tim Wirth</PERSON>, who is in charge of population 
policy. 
  President <PERSON>Bill Clinton</PERSON> announced last <DATE>Monday</DATE> the <DATE>1995</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>U.S.

press reports here said. 
  The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> is also teaming up with <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> to boost aid for

  When <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s Prime Minister <PERSON>Morihiro Hosokawa</PERSON> visits 
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> later next week, he and <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> will announce an

billion dollars</MONEY> by the end of the decade for population programs 
and combating AIDS [acquired immunodeficiency syndrome] in 
developing countries, an AP report quoted <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Government</ORGANIZATION>

will boost <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> assistance to the <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> Population Fund - which

the current <MONEY>40 million dollars</MONEY> to <MONEY>60 million dollars</MONEY> a year. 
  <PERSON>Wirth</PERSON> said that he hopes the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> population assistance to

<FÊP=106> [By <PERSON>Antonio Kamiya</PERSON>] </F>
  [Text] <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <DATE>March 12</DATE> KYODO -- The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> 
called off threatened sanctions against <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> on <DATE>Saturday</DATE> [12 
<DATE>March</DATE>] after <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> bowed to <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> pressure and agreed to a deal 
that will assure at least <MONEY>300 million dollars</MONEY> in business for 
<ORGANIZATION>Motorola Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a major <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> cellular phone system maker. 
  "We are delighted with the result," <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Trade 
Representative 
<PERSON>Mickey Kantor</PERSON> said in announcing that <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> has decided to 
drop retaliatory moves against <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>. 
  The cellular phone trade agreement, announced in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> on 
<DATE>Saturday</DATE>, came five days before <PERSON>Kantor</PERSON> was set to unveil a list 
of Japanese products that would be subject to punitive import 
tariffs. 
  Kantor hailed the accord, which commits the Japanese 
Government to underwrite a commitment from <ORGANIZATION>Motorola</ORGANIZATION>'s Japanese 
partner to expand the American cellular system in the 
Tokyo-Nagoya area, as the sort "results-oriented" trade pacts 
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> wants from <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> in the future. 
  "That is what portends for the future in our efforts to open 
(the Japanese) markets," <PERSON>Kantor</PERSON> said at a news conference. 
  The agreement, which <ORGANIZATION>Motorola</ORGANIZATION> and its Japanese partner 
<ORGANIZATION>Nippon 
Idou Tsushin Corp.</ORGANIZATION> (IDO) concluded under prodding from <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and 
Japanese Governments, has set specific terms the Japanese firm 
must meet by <DATE>December 1995</DATE>. 
  Top among them includes a commitment by IDO, which operates 
both a <ORGANIZATION>Motorola</ORGANIZATION> and a rival Japanese cellular system, to build 
159 relay stations over an 18-month period. 
  That infrastructure facility would enable the <ORGANIZATION>Motorola</ORGANIZATION> 
system 
to cover <PERCENT>95 percent</PERCENT> of the cellular market in a heavily 
populated corridor extending from <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Nagoya</LOCATION>. 
  At present, the <ORGANIZATION>Motorola</ORGANIZATION> cellular system can be used only in 
<PERCENT>40 percent</PERCENT> of the localities in the Tokyo-Nagoya market. 
  The Motorola-IDO accord also commits the Japanese cellular 
operator to freeze the development of the rival cellular system

  [Text] <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>, <DATE>April 14</DATE> KYODO -- A consumption tax hike is 
needed to finance a possible increase in social security costs 
in the face of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s rapidly aging society, the chief of a key 
government advisory panel on tax affairs said. 
  <PERSON>Kan Kato</PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>Tax Commission</ORGANIZATION>, said his panel 
will 
provide options such as a hike in the controversial consumption 
tax, an increase in social insurance premiums or no raise in 
social security costs to meet an aging society. 
  "But it will be understood naturally the best way is a raise 
in the consumption tax," <PERSON>Kato</PERSON> said in an interview with <ORGANIZATION>KYODO 
NEWS SERVICE</ORGANIZATION>. 
  The issue of how to respond to the nation's aging population 
with tax measures has been in the spotlight for some time. 
Prime Minister <PERSON>Morihiro Hosokawa</PERSON> failed two months ago to sell 
a proposal to introduce a national welfare tax to fund more than 
welfare alone. 
  The <ORGANIZATION>Finance Ministry</ORGANIZATION> has been pushing for a hike in the 
consumption tax as a way to raise funds to meet the needs of an 
aging society. Kato is viewed as close to <ORGANIZATION>Finance Ministry</ORGANIZATION> 
bureaucrats. 
  Kato, a professor emeritus at <ORGANIZATION>Keio University</ORGANIZATION>, also points 
to 
the need to implement administrative and fiscal reforms and to 
rectify the heavy dependence on direct taxes for state revenue. 
  But <PERSON>Kato</PERSON> said no one can expect administrative and fiscal 
reforms to save government spending in the short run, and a 
sweeping reform of the so-called unfair taxation system could 
result in additional tax revenue of only <MONEY>1 trillion yen</MONEY>. 
  As for a local consumption tax proposed by the <ORGANIZATION>Home Affairs 
Ministry</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Kato</PERSON> said he would like to discuss it in the form of a 
possible retail tax instead. 
  He also said his panel will take up the issue of whether or 
when to introduce a taxpayers' numbering system. 
  "It's no good to say just 'we'll consider it.' I hope to 
draw a conclusion on the issue, including whether to introduce 
it, by setting a deadline," he said.

  [Text] <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION>, <DATE>March 3</DATE> (XINHUA) -- The 10th Asian 
Parliamentarians' Meeting on Population and Development (APPD), 
whose purpose is to strengthen and promote cooperation among 
parliamentarians of some Asian countries, opened here today. 
  A message of congratulation from Chinese Premier <PERSON>Li Peng</PERSON> was 
read out at the opening ceremony. 
  Noting that <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> is the most populous region and also widely 
held to be the region with the most dynamic economic growth, <PERSON>Li</PERSON> 
said "To study and address the population problem of <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> will 
contribute significantly not only to <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION>'s prosperity and 
stability, but also to global peace and development." 
  The question of population is, in essence, a question of 
development, <PERSON>Li</PERSON> said. Only when the interaction between socio- 
economic development and population control is given thorough 
and balanced consideration can the problem of population be 
tackled at its root. 
  Li said that given the fact that countries vary considerably 
in their national conditions such as the level of economic 
development, natural resources, traditions, culture and 
religious practice, it is necessary for each country to 
formulate effective population and development policies in the 
light of its economic and social development and its other 
specific conditions and to strengthen international cooperation 
on this basis. 
  He said that women are an important force for promoting 
human 
progress and social development. An enhanced role and improved 
status of women will surely facilitate a rational resolution to 
the population problem. 
  Li noted that the <ORGANIZATION>Chinese Government</ORGANIZATION> has always attached 
great importance to the question of population and development 
and made family planning a basic state policy. 
  While vigorously promoting socio-economic development, he 
said, <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> has implemented family planning to bring congruity 
between population growth and socio-economic development so as 
to ensure prosperity for the country and a better life for its 
people. 
  Li said that <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> is ready to continuously strengthen its 
exchanges and cooperation with other countries and international 
organizations and work unremittingly for the stabilization of 
population and for prosperity and peace in <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> and the world. 
  Among those present were <PERSON>Zhao Dongwan</PERSON>, leader of the 
delegation of <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>National People's Congress</ORGANIZATION> (NPC) and 
chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>NPC Education, Science</ORGANIZATION>, Culture and <ORGANIZATION>Public 
Health Committee</ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON>Fukusaburo Maeda</PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>Asian 
Population and Development Association</ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON>Shin Sakurai</PERSON> and <PERSON>Prasop 
Ratanakorn</PERSON>, chairman and secretary general of the AFPPD 
respectively; <PERSON>Hirofumi Ando</PERSON>, deputy executive director of the 
<ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> Population Fund (<ORGANIZATION>UNFPA</ORGANIZATION>) [acronym as received]; and 
parliamentarians, scholars and experts from 15 countries 
including <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>, representatives of international organizations, 
and some Beijing-based diplomatic envoys. 
  In his speech, <PERSON>Zhao Dongwan</PERSON> spoke highly of the many Asian 
countries which have made progress in birth control and 
population quality over the past decade. 
  Reviewing the remarkable achievements made by <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> in 
economic growth and population control, he said that although 
the fertility rate in <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> has dropped noticeably, the annual 
net population increase is still estimated at around 16 million. 
  Therefore, he said, <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> must strictly enforce family 
planning to control population growth, while developing its 
economy. 
  Zhao said that realizing sustainable and harmonious 
development is considered a long and arduous task but the only 
alternative for <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> over a long period of time. 
  He said that <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>, like many other developing countries in 
<LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION>, is facing an incompatibility between population growth and 
socio- economic development. <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> attaches great importance to 
friendly cooperation with Asian countries. 
  Zhao said he hoped the meeting would deliberate on 
population 
and development issues, particularly the status of women. 
  The Chinese delegates are willing to make the meeting a 
success along with other participants and to contribute to the 
<ORGANIZATION>International Conference on Population and Development</ORGANIZATION> to be 
held in <LOCATION>Cairo</LOCATION> in <DATE>September this year</DATE>, he said. 
  <PERSON>Fukusaburo Maeda</PERSON> said the significance of the meeting is 
underlined by the fact that it is being held in <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>, "which 
has the greatest population of all countries in the world and 
which, moreover, has achieved an unmatched success in population 
policy while proceeding with rapid economic growth." 
  He described <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>'s extraordinary growth of the economy and 
the population growth control as "clear proof that population 
and development are closely related." 
  <PERSON>Shin Sakurai</PERSON> and <PERSON>Hirofumi Ando</PERSON> also delivered speeches at 
the 
meeting.

  <LOCATION>Benin</LOCATION>, a small country in west <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> bordering <LOCATION>Nigeria</LOCATION>, is 
a

  [Text] <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>, <DATE>May 16</DATE> KYODO -- Prime Minister <PERSON>Tsutomu Hata</PERSON> 
on <DATE>Monday</DATE> [16 May] made a renewed pledge to seek permanent 
membership in the <ORGANIZATION>UN Security Council</ORGANIZATION> [<ORGANIZATION>UNSC</ORGANIZATION>], saying <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> 
should gain a permanent seat in the key council to break its 
monopoly by war victors. 
  Hata told a plenary session of the <ORGANIZATION>House of Councillors</ORGANIZATION> that 
there is a growing voice in the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION> for <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> to play 
a larger role in the key UN forum, which was set up by the 
victors of World War II. 
  Hata said many important issues, including even environment 
and population problems, are decided at the council. 
  "There is a call in the UN in the new age for <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> to play 
a 
role," <PERSON>Hata</PERSON> said. 
  The premier responded to questions by <PERSON>Manso Hamamoto</PERSON> of the 
<ORGANIZATION>Social Democratic Party</ORGANIZATION> [of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>] and <PERSON>Akira Kuroyanagi</PERSON> of 
<LOCATION>Komeito</LOCATION> over <LOCATION>Hata</LOCATION>'s key policy speech before the Diet last week. 
  Hata also said the government is working on objective 
criteria to measure progress in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s market opening steps to 
reduce its huge trade surplus with the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, but reiterated his 
refusal to set numerical targets. 
  While stressing the importance of improving soured trade 
ties 
with the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Hata</PERSON> said setting numerical targets would run 
counter to the efforts for administrative reform aimed at 
lessening the government's intervention in the private sector. 
  The bilateral talks under a trade framework agreement 
foundered in <DATE>February</DATE>, when former Prime Minister <PERSON>Morihiro 
Hosokawa</PERSON> rejected demands by <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> President <PERSON>Bill Clinton</PERSON> for 
numerical targets to gauge market access improvement in some 
sectors, such as in autos, insurance and medical equipment 
procurement.

  [Text] <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>, <DATE>June 16</DATE> KYODO -- A Japanese Government panel 
called <DATE>Thursday</DATE> [16 <DATE>June</DATE>] for "urgently" implementing a set of 
economic restructuring measures to revitalize <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s economy 
toward the next century. "The Japanese economy now stands at 
the crossroads," the <ORGANIZATION>Industrial Structure Council</ORGANIZATION> said in a 
report, citing such problems as the rapid aging of the 
population, the lingering current account imbalance and the 
"excessive" strength of the yen. 
  The report urged the government to formulate a reform 
program 
by effectively combining three types of steps -- macroeconomic 
restructuring measures like social infrastructure improvement, 
microeconomic reforms such as deregulation and narrowing of the 
price gap between <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> and other countries, and overhauling the 
industrial structure for new business creation. 
  The advisory body to the minister of international trade and 
industry said the government's failure to carry out these 
measures would deprive the Japanese economy of "industrial 
vitality" toward the next century, promote "industrial 
hollowing" and eventually degrade the overall life standard of 
the Japanese people. "The report is not merely a collection of 
recommendations that simply depict a vision of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s future 
economy," a ministry official said. "But it reflects a strong 
sense of crisis among council members about the future course of 
the Japanese economy," the official said. 
  The council cited 12 industrial sectors as having growth 
potential toward the <DATE>21st century</DATE>. They are housing-related 
services, medical and welfare services, culture, urban 
development, environmental improvement, energy, distribution, 
new manufacturing technology, labor services, business support, 
information and communications, and cultural services involved 
in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s internationalization. 
  The proposed reform steps would help create a substantial 
amount of new business opportunities in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, with the market 
size of such business growing to <MONEY>210 trillion yen</MONEY> in <DATE>2000</DATE> from 
the current <MONEY>130 trillion yen</MONEY> in the 12 sectors combined. The 
council also said the reforms would produce 2.5 million new jobs 
by <DATE>2000</DATE>. 
  If large-scale industrial restructuring is carried out, the 
Japanese economy could achieve an annual growth rate of more 
than <PERCENT>3 percent</PERCENT> by the turn of the century, the report said. It 
also said <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s manpower structure would undergo big changes 
under the proposed economic reform. 
  The proportion of workers in services and livelihood-related 
sectors would increase while those in distribution and 
transportation would drop, for example, the report said. 
Without the proposed reforms, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s economic growth would 
slow to an annual average of <PERCENT>1.6 percent</PERCENT> during 1992-2000 and an 
average <PERCENT>1.2 percent</PERCENT> during 2000-2010, the report said. The 
council said <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> should propose industrial policy coordination 
among developed countries as a way to spur new business 
creation, a step that may present solutions for global 
unemployment. 
  The issue of trade and labor standards should be addressed 
in 
a manner that would enable free trade to be pursued in 
developing countries while upgrading labor conditions there, the 
report said.

<TEXT>
   Statistics that show <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s population growth
declining to a postwar low are likely to sharpen fears that lagging
birth rates are weakening the nation's economy.
   Preliminary figures released <DATE>Friday</DATE> from <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s <DATE>1990</DATE> census
show the nation grew by only <PERCENT>2.1 percent</PERCENT> <DATE>from 1985</DATE> to <DATE>1990</DATE>. The <PERCENT>3.4
percent</PERCENT> growth from 1980-85 was the previous postwar low.
   The <DATE>Oct. 1</DATE> census counted 123,622,541 people in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>. The
country is still the world's seventh most populous, but it has one
of the world's slowest growth rates.
   Over the past year, the country has been flooded with magazine,
newspaper and television reports that speak of a ``baby shock.''
Officials express fear that with fewer children, the nation will
eventually have trouble supporting the elderly, a growing
percentage of the population.
   Business leaders say industry is already beginning to feel a
labor shortage.
   Birth rates in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> have been declining since the introduction
of modern birth control after World War II, according to <PERSON>Dr. Makoto
Atoh</PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION>Health and Welfare Ministry</ORGANIZATION>'s department of
population policy studies.
   A housing shortage, high land prices, rising ages at marriage,
and the soaring costs of education and child-rearing have
contributed to the declining rate, he said.
   ``We think the major cause for the decline is the rising
percentage of singles and the rising age of marriage,'' <PERSON>Atoh</PERSON> said.
   Health and <ORGANIZATION>Welfare Ministry</ORGANIZATION> figures show that <PERCENT>20 percent</PERCENT> of
people in their late 20s were single in <DATE>1975</DATE>, but <PERCENT>37 percent</PERCENT> in
that age group were single last year.
   Most women believe the high cost of educating children is the
biggest obstacle to having more, said <PERSON>Dr. Naohiro Ogawa</PERSON>, deputy
director of the <ORGANIZATION>Nippon University</ORGANIZATION> population research institute,
and the consultant for a recent survey by <ORGANIZATION>Mainichi</ORGANIZATION> newspaper.
   Another factor is cramped housing conditions and the
astronomical prices of new homes. Mechanization in the home,
expanded education and job opportunities have led an increasing
number of women out of the home.
   Some say the refusal of men to change their roles in the home
discourages large families.
   ``Japanese men don't share housekeeping. All the burden is on
the shoulder of women at home, so it's impossible to have more
children,'' said <PERSON>Mariko Mitsui</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> city assemblywoman.
   A government policy group has considered revamping maternity
leaves, changing housing policies, and improving child care as
measures to get women to have more children.
   Finance Minister <PERSON>Ryutaro Hashimoto</PERSON>, a governing Liberal
Democratic Party leader and a likely future prime minister, caused
an uproar in <DATE>June</DATE> when he was quoted as blaming the shrinking birth
rates on the expanded opportunities for higher education for women.
   Hashimoto later denied making the remark.
   Four out of five women questioned in the <LOCATION>Mainichi</LOCATION> survey said
they opposed government intervention to boost the birth rate, <PERSON>Ogawa</PERSON>
said.

  [Text] <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>, Mar 4 KYODO -- An international gathering to 
discuss measures to achieve environmental conservation and 
economic development in the Asia-Pacific region in the next

pledged to draw up a report on such measures with the help of 
other Asia-Pacific nations and the <ORGANIZATION>UN</ORGANIZATION>. 
  The first meeting on the project called "ECO <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> 21 Plan" 
will decide on the date of release of the report while 
discussing concrete measures, the officials said. 
  <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> will tell the meeting that it wants to submit an 
interim report to a gathering of the <ORGANIZATION>Economic and Social 
Commission</ORGANIZATION> for <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> (<ORGANIZATION>ESCAP</ORGANIZATION>) to be held next year 
and a final report to a special <ORGANIZATION>U.N. General Assembly</ORGANIZATION> session in 
<DATE>1997</DATE>, they said. 
  The plan will propose policies, financial aid and 
international cooperation needed to maintain the environment and 
yet promote development in the region. 
  The experts will draft the program after making projections 
for the region's future population, economic growth, 
manufacturing, agriculture, forestry, demand for energy, state 
of urban areas, and environmental conservation policies, the 
officials said.

  [Text] <LOCATION>Dalian</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>, <DATE>May 17</DATE> KYODO -- A large industrial 
complex for Japanese enterprises has been completed in <LOCATION>Dalian</LOCATION>, 
<LOCATION>Liaoning Province</LOCATION>, northeastern <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>. 
  About 70 manufacturing enterprises, mostly Japanese, will be 
invited to build production facilities in the 
2.2-square-kilometer complex in the city's economic and 
technology development district, officials said. 
  Seventeen firms, including auto parts, steel and towel

established offices or plants in the quickly developing city as 
of <DATE>last August</DATE>, they said. 
  As a result, the city's Japanese population doubled to about 
2,000 in the <DATE>last one and a half years</DATE>, they said. 
  <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> began the joint <MONEY>3.5 billion yen</MONEY> project in 
<DATE>October 1992</DATE>.

  [Text] <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>, <DATE>April 25</DATE> KYODO -- Outgoing Foreign Minister 
<PERSON>Tsutomu Hata</PERSON>, who is virtually certain to become premier later 
in the day, repeated suggestions <DATE>Monday</DATE> that he may ask Social 
Democratic Party (SDP) Chairman <PERSON>Tomiichi Murayama</PERSON> to join the 
new cabinet. 
  Hata also indicated at a press conference after an 
extraordinary cabinet meeting, where the eight-month-old cabinet 
of prime minister <PERSON>Morihiro Hosokawa</PERSON> resigned, that the changes 
in the new cabinet will be small to middle-scale. 
  Hata said that "in general," it is better to have heads of 
coalition parties in the cabinet to reflect the parties' 
opinions, indicating he may ask Murayama to join the cabinet. 
There were six <ORGANIZATION>SDP</ORGANIZATION> cabinet ministers in the <LOCATION>Hosokawa</LOCATION> government 
but <PERSON>Murayama</PERSON> did not hold any cabinet post. 
  Hata, who was also deputy premier in the <LOCATION>Hosokawa</LOCATION> 
administration, said that in principle, it is desirable for the 
ministers who helped compiled the fiscal <DATE>1994</DATE> budget bill to 
remain in the cabinet and respond to upcoming Diet 
interpellations on the budget. 
  Reviewing his eight-month-long tenure as foreign minister, 
<PERSON>Hata</PERSON> said he felt the world expected <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> to speak up more on 
the international scene. 
  <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> could make various proposals on problems such as 
population, environment, AIDS, disarmament and arms control, he 
said. 
  Hata also said foreign ministers should not change so often 
and that he regrets he was only able to hold the post for eight 
months. 
  He also said <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> should push ahead with deregulation.

  [Text] <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>, <DATE>May 28</DATE> KYODO -- A government advisory panel 
studying the nation's overall development blueprint urges the 
government to take actual steps toward the relocation of the 
functions of the capital from <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>, according to the draft 
report by the panel obtained <DATE>Saturday</DATE> [28 May] by KYODO NEWS 
SERVICE. 
  The <ORGANIZATION>National Land Development Council</ORGANIZATION> also calls for a 
reprogramming of the government's development policy to enhance 
exchanges and alliances among regional communities, the draft 
report said. 
  The council's final report on its review on the nation's 
<DATE>1987</DATE> 
comprehensive development plan stressed the need for a 
reassessment of the traditional roles for the central and local 
governments as well as reorganizations of local communities. 
  The report, which should serve as the basis for the next 
development blueprint, is scheduled to be submitted to Prime 
Minister <PERSON>Tsutomu Hata</PERSON> on <DATE>June 16</DATE> after approval by the council. 
  The report points to drastic changes in social conditions 
since the <DATE>1987</DATE> program, citing a declining birth rate, the 
dragging recession and the yen's upswing. 
  It advises the government to pay more attention to "exchange 
population," or the number of people who travel around at home 
or abroad. 
  As measures to boost local exchanges, it proposes the 
development of highways that connect local core cities, faster 
railway transportations, and new railway networks and better 
access to airports. 
  The council lauds proposed new corridors in the east and 
west 
<LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> and along the Sea of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> coastline as possible 
incubators for cross-regional intercourses. 
  In light of the increasing role that <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> should play in 
<LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION>, the report urges the creation of new economic areas 
surrounding the Sea of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> or the Yellow Sea. 
  It also proposes nurturing "small global cities" that enjoy 
direct international exchanges in some specific fields. 
  To respond to the shift of production overseas by 
manufacturers and the increasing share of software industries, 
the report advocates the creation of higher-grade service 
industry through developing high-capacity, high-speed 
telecommunications networks utilizing the technology of optical 
fibers and telecommunications satellite. 
  The report also drew attention to environmental protection, 
and exhorts <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s active involvement, not only domestically 
but globally, in the issue.

  [Text] <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>, <DATE>Feb. 18</DATE> KYODO -- A senior 
telecommunications official said <DATE>Friday</DATE> [18 <DATE>February</DATE>] it is up 
to the private sector to resolve a dispute between <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> and the 
<LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> over <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> access to <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s cellular telephone 
market. 
  <PERSON>Yoshio Utsumi</PERSON>, director general of the Posts and 
<ORGANIZATION>Telecommunications Ministry's International Affairs Department</ORGANIZATION>, 
made the comment while briefing foreign reporters on <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s 
position on the matter. 
  An official at the department confirmed the content of 
<PERSON>Utsumi</PERSON>'s remarks at the briefing but said they were not as 
strong as had been reported. 
  AP-DOW JONES NEWS SERVICE reported that <PERSON>Utsumi</PERSON> warned that 
<ORGANIZATION>Motorola Inc.</ORGANIZATION>'s business in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> could suffer if the company 
and the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Government</ORGANIZATION> picked an "unnecessary" fight about the 
need for immediate results. 
  The ministry official said the tone of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> wire 
service's report was too strong. "He (<PERSON>Utsumi</PERSON>) did not make such 
a warning. That story seems a little strong," the official said. 
  The <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Government</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>earlier this week</DATE> it plans to 
impose sanctions against <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> for violating a <DATE>1989</DATE> bilateral 
cellular telephone agreement. 
  The agreement paved the way for <ORGANIZATION>Motorola</ORGANIZATION> to offer cellular 
telephones in the densely populated corridor between <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> and 
<LOCATION>Nagoya</LOCATION> on the basis of its own system. 
  Japanese officials say <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> has fulfilled its 
responsibilities to abide by the agreement, but the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> side 
complains that implementation of the agreement has effectively 
discriminated against <ORGANIZATION>Motorola</ORGANIZATION>.

  [Text] <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>, <DATE>May 30</DATE> KYODO -- <ORGANIZATION>The Ministry of Finance</ORGANIZATION> 
[MOF] plans to allow a portion of the revenues collected from 
the consumption tax to be handled by local governments, ministry 
sources said <DATE>Monday</DATE> [30 May]. 
  The ministry will soon offer a compromise proposal to the 
<ORGANIZATION>Home Affairs Ministry</ORGANIZATION>, which, along with local governments, has 
urged the introduction of a local consumption tax. 
  Currently, the state government collects all consumption tax 
revenues and distributes <PERCENT>20 percent</PERCENT> of revenues to autonomies. 
  Under the <ORGANIZATION>Finance Ministry</ORGANIZATION> proposal, the same proportion of 
income from the consumption tax will be collected by 
municipalities and then pooled and distributed according to 
population and consumption levels. 
  Introduction of a local consumption tax is one of the 
focuses 
in the planned tax system overhaul the government plans to work 
out by <DATE>late June</DATE>. 
  The <ORGANIZATION>Finance Ministry</ORGANIZATION> initially opposed the idea but has 
conceded in the face of mounting calls for the need to boost the 
financial base of local governments. 
  Its proposal is slightly different from that of the <ORGANIZATION>Home 
Affairs Ministry</ORGANIZATION>, which requested that <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s 47 prefectures 
collect the tax and the money gathered be distributed in 
accordance with the number of workers in each prefecture. 
  If the <ORGANIZATION>Finance Ministry</ORGANIZATION>'s plan is accepted, the share of 
revenues for such major cities as <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Osaka</LOCATION> will be much 
smaller than the original plan because many people who work in 
the major cities live outside city limits.

  [Text] <LOCATION>Fukui</LOCATION>, <DATE>March 30</DATE> KYODO -- Activists of the 
international environmental organization <ORGANIZATION>Greenpeace</ORGANIZATION> arrived 
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE> [30 <DATE>March</DATE>] aboard the patrol boat MV <ORGANIZATION>Greenpeace</ORGANIZATION> in 
<LOCATION>Tsuruga</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fukui Prefecture</LOCATION>, to protest the start-up of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s 
prototype fast breeder reactor Monju there. 
  During the 10-day port call at <LOCATION>Tsuruga</LOCATION>, Captain <PERSON>Arne 
Sorensen</PERSON> 
and 18 <ORGANIZATION>Greenpeace</ORGANIZATION> activists will inform local residents of the 
dangers Monju poses for the environment in videos and a photo 
exhibition on the boat, spokeswoman <PERSON>Etsuko Ikeda</PERSON> said. 
  The fast breeder operated by the governmental <ORGANIZATION>Power Reactor 
and Nuclear Fuel Development Corp.</ORGANIZATION> will soon reach what is 
called "criticality," the stage when a nuclear chain reaction is 
self-sustaining. Ikeda said <ORGANIZATION>Greenpeace</ORGANIZATION> estimates Monju will 
reach criticality on <DATE>April 8</DATE>. 
  The reactor, which uses a mixture of highly toxic plutonium 
and enriched uranium as fuel, will then produce 280,000 
kilowatts of electricity. 
  In a recent report, <ORGANIZATION>Greenpeace</ORGANIZATION> warned that Monju "could 
explode like an atomic bomb, killing thousands and contaminating 
most population centers in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> and neighboring countries." 
  <ORGANIZATION>Greenpeace</ORGANIZATION> also alleged that the Japanese Government is 
withholding important data on the safety risk posed by Monju. 
Noting that the original safety assessment for the fast breeder 
was undertaken over 10 years ago, <ORGANIZATION>Greenpeace</ORGANIZATION> called for a new 
safety review and a full environmental impact statement. 
  On its previous mission last <DATE>October</DATE>, the MV <ORGANIZATION>Greenpeace</ORGANIZATION> 
monitored nuclear waste dumped into the Sea of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> by <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> 
and the former <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>.

  [Text] <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>, <DATE>March 12</DATE> KYODO -- <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Ambassador to <PERSON>Japan 
Walter Mondale</PERSON> announced <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> [12 <DATE>March</DATE>] that the 
<LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> have reached an agreement on the opening 
of the Japanese cellular telephone market. 
  In a statement released by the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Embassy</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>, 
<PERSON>Mondale</PERSON> 
praised the Japanese Government for its hard work in resolving 
the long-standing problem. 
  "The government of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> will take all available measures to 
ensure compliance with these commitments," the statement said. 
  Among the commitments are "to build 159 new base stations, 
containing an additional 9,900 voice channels, according to an 
agreed quarterly schedule, to provide coverage for <PERCENT>95 percent</PERCENT> of 
the population by <DATE>December 1995</DATE>, and to reallocate spectrum for 
use by the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> technology-based system," it said. 
  "This agreement demonstrates that the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> can 
work 
together to achieve real market access in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>," it said. 
  Meanwhile, Posts and Telecommunications Minister <PERSON>Takenori 
Kanzaki</PERSON> issued a statement on the Japan-U.S. agreement, which 
read as follows: 
  1. <PERSON>Mr. Walter F. Mondale</PERSON>, <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, and I 
have come to a final agreement today on the cellular phone issue 
between <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>United States of America</LOCATION>. 
  2. <ORGANIZATION>Nippon Idou Tsushin Corp.</ORGANIZATION> (IDO) has drawn up a plan for 
expanded installation for the North American-type analog 
cellular telephone system and transfer of a part of the spectrum 
currently allocated to the company to the North American-type 
system portion. The Government of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Government</ORGANIZATION> of 
the <LOCATION>United States of America</LOCATION> have decided to take measures 
including holding of regular meetings to assess implementation 
of the IDO measures. 
  3. The Government of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> will terminate 
actions under Section 1377 of of the Omnibus Trade and 
Competition Act in response to these measures to be taken by the 
Japanese side. 
  4. I would like to pay respect for cooperation by Ambassador 
<PERSON>Mondale</PERSON> and the efforts made by the corporations concerned 
during the process leading to the resolution of this issue. I 
earnestly hope that the settlement will translate into 
maintenance and further development of the good economic 
relationship between the two countries. 
  Later the same night, <PERSON>Mondale</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Kanzaki</ORGANIZATION> had a joint news 
conference at the <ORGANIZATION>Post</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Telecommunications Ministry</ORGANIZATION>. 
  <PERSON>Mondale</PERSON> said the agreement is a good example for promoting 
the U.S.-Japan trade framework talks. He added that although 
the cellular phone negotiations are different from the framework 
talks, both sides should have heart-to-heart discussions with 
utmost effort. 
  <PERSON>Mondale</PERSON> also said the agreement will facilitate competition 
in high technology and will eventually benefit Japanese 
consumers. 
  <ORGANIZATION>Kanzaki</ORGANIZATION> said that <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> did not agree to setting of 
numerical 
targets with the agreement.

  [Text] <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>, <DATE>Feb. 24</DATE> KYODO -- Vice Premier <PERSON>Zhu Rongji</PERSON> 
defended <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>'s economic modernization program <DATE>Thursday</DATE> [24 
<DATE>February</DATE>], saying reforms are "without major problems" despite 
some symptoms of overheating. 
  While acknowledging foreign concerns about an overheating of 
the Chinese economy given its breath-taking double-digit growth, 
<PERSON>Zhu</PERSON> said he does not think the <PERCENT>13 percent</PERCENT> growth of the past two 
years is too rapid, although prolonging such growth could prove 
difficult. 
  Zhu, seen as the main architect of <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>'s ambitious 
economic 
reforms, said macroeconomic measures introduced last <DATE>summer</DATE> to 
rein in money supply and restore order to an inflation-wracked 
economy have stabilized prices and created an environment for 
stable growth. "We haven't seen big economic ups and downs," 
<PERSON>Zhu</PERSON> said, dismissing allegations that macroeconomic controls are 
failing. 
  Addressing Japanese business leaders at a <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> hotel, Zhu 
denounced foreign press reports of growing social unrest due to 
soaring prices as distorting reality. Although inflation in big 
cities has reached <PERCENT>18.6 percent</PERCENT>, the urban population actually 
enjoyed better living standards as salaries increased by some <PERCENT>25 
percent</PERCENT> <DATE>last year</DATE>, he said. 
  <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION> is well aware of inflationary risks but does not 
consider the current level of <PERCENT>13.4 percent</PERCENT> as cause for concern, 
<PERSON>Zhu</PERSON> said, adding the increase in money supply has been 
successfully stabilized at about <PERCENT>20 percent</PERCENT>. 
  The implementation of a comprehensive economic reform 
program, including the introduction of new taxes and a single, 
market-oriented foreign exchange rate system since <DATE>January 1</DATE>, 
has been "going smoothly and without creating major problems." 
  Beijing will do away with its special foreign currency swap 
centers from <DATE>April 1</DATE>, from which time foreign exchange will be 
handled solely through banks, said <PERSON>Zhu</PERSON>, who also heads <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>'s 
<ORGANIZATION>Central Bank</ORGANIZATION>. 
  The planned transformation of <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>'s banks into commercial 
banks will have to go hand in hand with the restructuring of 
unprofitable state enterprises which have depended on cheap 
loans while adjusting to market transition. Zhu predicted "big 
progress," however, in the privatization of the state-run sector 
this year. 
  Beijing hopes that a total overhaul of the tax system will 
help gradually increase the central government's revenue share 
from the present <PERCENT>30 percent</PERCENT> to about <PERCENT>60 percent</PERCENT> by the year <DATE>2000</DATE>. 
  Zhu dismissed as "groundless" rumors that foreign companies 
will soon be listed on the <LOCATION>Shanghai</LOCATION> stock exchange. <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION> is 
taking a very cautious stance toward the country's fledgling 
stock exchanges, closely monitoring Chinese firms to prevent an 
"economic bubble" like that which occurred in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>. 
  Japan-China trade, which soared by <PERCENT>54 percent</PERCENT> to <MONEY>39 billion 
dollars</MONEY> last year, is nevertheless "still small," considering 
the potential of <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>'s huge market, he said. Increased 
investment and trade with <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> could help <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> overcome its 
prolonged recession and boost the competitiveness of Japanese 
products, Zhu pointed out, adding he hopes trade relations 
between the two countries would "reach a new level." 
  Zhu arrived in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> for a nine-day trip 
focusing on increasing economic ties. Besides visiting a number 
of prefectures to study <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s economic and corporate 
structures, the vice premier will also meet present and former 
political leaders.

  During the meeting, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> agreed that <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION>'s

  [Text] <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>, <DATE>Feb. 16</DATE> KYODO -- Prime Minister <PERSON>Morihiro 
Hosokawa</PERSON> suggested <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> [16 <DATE>February</DATE>] <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> will file a 
complaint to the <ORGANIZATION>General Agreement of Tariffs and Trade</ORGANIZATION> (<ORGANIZATION>GATT</ORGANIZATION>) 
if the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> imposes trade sanctions on <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>. 
  "We will seek a settlement of unilateral sanctions in 
accordance with international rules," said <PERSON>Hosokawa</PERSON>, during a 
plenary session of the <ORGANIZATION>House of Representatives</ORGANIZATION>. 
  He said <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> has not violated trade rules, and expressed 
concern about <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> threats of sanctions. 
  Hosokawa's remarks came after the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> unveiled 
steps to impose sanctions worth <MONEY>hundreds of millions of dollars</MONEY> 
in a dispute over access to the Japanese cellular phone market. 
  The prime minister said <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> will "voluntarily" improve 
government procurement procedures and foreign access to its 
markets, but did not elaborate. 
  Hosokawa hailed his failed trade negotiations with <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> 
President <PERSON>Bill Clinton</PERSON>, saying the talks represented the outset 
of new <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>- <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> relations reflecting a stronger sense of 
trust, in which both countries will make clear what they cannot 
do. 
  Hosokawa told the lower house he and <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> held "good" 
talks in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> on <DATE>February 11</DATE> as they exchanged opinions on 
various issues, including the international situation. 
  Hosokawa and <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> agreed not to damage bilateral 
relations 
though they failed to strike a deal on a new "framework" to 
slash <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s trade surplus and increase the share of imports in 
its markets, he said. 
  The premier said he and <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> agreed to promote bilateral 
cooperation on global issues such as the environment, population 
and AIDS. 
  Hosokawa said he told <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> that <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> would "do what it 
could" if the <ORGANIZATION>UN Security Council</ORGANIZATION> imposed sanctions on <LOCATION>North 
Korea</LOCATION> over its suspected nuclear arms development program. 
  He also called the planned one-time tax reduction an 
"emergency measure," saying permanent reductions of income and 
residence taxes will be included in the comprehensive tax reform 
he has pledged to carry out by the end of the year. 
  The ruling coalition agreed <DATE>February 8</DATE> to implement a 
one-time <MONEY>6 trillion yen</MONEY> income tax cut for <DATE>1994</DATE> as a means of 
stimulating the sluggish economy. 
  The tax reform package will include financing of the tax cut 
because, at the time of the agreement, <PERSON>Hosokawa</PERSON> was forced to 
abandon his plan to replace the <PERCENT>3 percent</PERCENT> consumption tax with a 
<PERCENT>7 percent</PERCENT> "national welfare tax" mainly to finance the reduction.
