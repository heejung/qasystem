<HEAD>Scandinavian Airlines Closes Continental Deal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   <ORGANIZATION>Scandinavian Airlines System</ORGANIZATION> completed a <MONEY>$50
million</MONEY> deal <DATE>Thursday</DATE> that makes it the largest shareholder of
<ORGANIZATION>Continental Airlines Holdings Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and puts <PERSON>Frank Lorenzo</PERSON> out as
<ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> chairman.
   Lorenzo will get <MONEY>$30 million</MONEY> through the arrangement, approved a
day earlier by the <ORGANIZATION>Transportation Department</ORGANIZATION>, but a <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>
spokesman said the money is not all coming from the <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> purchase.
   ``<PERSON>Mr. Lorenzo</PERSON>'s <MONEY>$30 million</MONEY> is paid out over a period of time
through the company,'' spokesman Art <PERSON>Kent</PERSON> said. ``It's not like
he's getting a lump sum.''
   <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> said it paid Lorenzo <MONEY>$17 million</MONEY> to buy out his employment
contract and to obtain vested options he had in <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> stock,
although <LOCATION>Lorenzo</LOCATION> retains options on 783,333 shares. Lorenzo remains
as a <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> director.
   As part of the deal, <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> purchased <ORGANIZATION>Jet Capital Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, which
<PERSON>Lorenzo</PERSON> and partners used as a holding company for their shares of
<ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> also bought 2.25 million newly issued shares of
<ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> for <MONEY>$14</MONEY> per share.
   <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION>, based in
<LOCATION>Stockholm</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION>, issued a joint statement <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>evening</TIME> that
also announced several appointments to the 15-member <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>
board.
   As previously announced, the former president of <ORGANIZATION>Delta Airlines</ORGANIZATION>,
<PERSON>Hollis L. Harris</PERSON>, of <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>, becomes president and chief executive
of <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>Harris</PERSON> also joins the board.
   Long-time <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> director <PERSON>Carl Pohlad</PERSON>, of <LOCATION>Minneapolis</LOCATION>, was
elected chairman. <PERSON>Robert Garrett</PERSON>, of <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, was elected chairman
of the executive committee.
   <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> said it would appoint three members to the <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>
board, including <PERSON>Jan Carlzon</PERSON>, of <LOCATION>Stockholm</LOCATION>, president and chief
executive of <ORGANIZATION>SAS Group</ORGANIZATION>. The other <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> appointees are <PERSON>Lars Bergvall</PERSON>,
of <LOCATION>Stockholm</LOCATION>, chief operating officer of <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION>; and <PERSON>Roberto Mendoza</PERSON>,
of <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, vice chairman of <ORGANIZATION>J.P. Morgan</ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
   The <ORGANIZATION>Transportation Department</ORGANIZATION> will allow
<ORGANIZATION>Scandinavian Airlines System</ORGANIZATION> to buy out most of <PERSON>Frank Lorenzo</PERSON>'s
interest in <ORGANIZATION>Continental Airlines Holdings Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, the department said
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
   The move will nearly double <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION>'s stake in the parent company of
<ORGANIZATION>Continental Airlines</ORGANIZATION> through a <MONEY>$52.5 million</MONEY> stock purchase.
   Under the deal approved by the department, <ORGANIZATION>Scandanavian Airlines</ORGANIZATION>
will own <PERCENT>16.8 percent</PERCENT> of <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> and <PERCENT>18.4 percent</PERCENT> of its voting
stock, and will be given three seats on the holding company's
15-member board.
   However, <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> agreed to not buy more than <PERCENT>22 percent</PERCENT> of
<ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>'s voting stock for three years. It cannot own more than
<PERCENT>25 percent</PERCENT> because of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> laws requiring that domestic airlines be
controlled by Americans. <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> already owned <PERCENT>9.9 percent</PERCENT> of
<ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>'s voting stock.
   <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> agreed to buy 2.25 million shares of newly issued
<ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> stock for <MONEY>$31.5 million</MONEY> and will pay another <MONEY>$21
million</MONEY> to buy <ORGANIZATION>Jet Capital Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, which owns another 2.1 million
shares of <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> stock. The Jet Capital stock was owned by
<LOCATION>Lorenzo</LOCATION>.
   Lorenzo, who continues to own some 800,000 shares of the
company, resigned last month as chief executive officer of
<ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> and has been replaced by <PERSON>Hollis Harris</PERSON>, former
president of <ORGANIZATION>Delta Airlines</ORGANIZATION>.
   Some <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> shareholders have filed lawsuits in <ORGANIZATION>Delaware
Chancery Court</ORGANIZATION> asking that the transactions among <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>, Jet
Capital, <PERSON>Lorenzo</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> be blocked. They argued the deals were

and <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> shareholders.''

   Holders Sue to Stop

   Several Continental Airlines Holdings Inc. shareholders
sued to stop the proposed purchase of Frank Lorenzo's stake
in the airline company by Scandinavian Airlines System.
   In addition to Mr. Lorenzo, who stepped down as chairman
and chief executive officer of Continental Holdings, the
plaintiffs also sued that company, its directors and Jet
Capital Corp., the tightly controlled holding company that
owns a special class of Continental Holdings stock. SAS was
not named in the suits.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The suits -- three of them filed in <ORGANIZATION>Delaware Chancery
Court</ORGANIZATION> and a fourth filed in <ORGANIZATION>U.S. District Court</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION>
-- allege that <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> directors breached their fiduciary
duty by agreeing to a buy-out in which <PERSON>Mr. Lorenzo</PERSON> and Jet
Capital's other shareholders receive <MONEY>$14</MONEY> to <MONEY>$18</MONEY> apiece for
their shares. In <ORGANIZATION>American Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading
yesterday, <ORGANIZATION>Continental Holdings</ORGANIZATION> shares closed at <MONEY>$5.25</MONEY>, down
<MONEY>87.5 cents</MONEY>.
   <PERSON>Mr. Lorenzo</PERSON> agreed last week to sell all his stock in
<ORGANIZATION>Continental Holdings</ORGANIZATION> to <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> and to vacate his management
posts at both the holding company and its <ORGANIZATION>Continental
Airlines</ORGANIZATION> unit, although he will remain a director. <PERSON>Mr.
Lorenzo</PERSON> would receive more than <MONEY>$30 million</MONEY>, including <MONEY>$10.8
million</MONEY> for his shares in Jet Capital, and <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> would buy most
of his stock options, also at a premium. The transaction
would boost <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION>'s equity stake to <PERCENT>16.8%</PERCENT> from <PERCENT>9.8%</PERCENT>.
   The <LOCATION>Delaware</LOCATION> suits charge that <PERSON>Mr. Lorenzo</PERSON> would receive
amounts vastly exceeding the value of his stock options and
his employment contract. Similarly, the <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> suit
claims <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> is paying <PERSON>Mr. Lorenzo</PERSON> four times the value of his
equity. The <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> suits ask for unspecified damages and
all the suits seek to stop the transaction.
   A <ORGANIZATION>Continental Holdings</ORGANIZATION> spokesman said the company believes
the transaction to be proper, and that it was scrutinized by
attorneys and financial advisers for all the parties
involved. "We are confident the directors will be absolved of
any wrongdoing," he said.

   Hollis L. Harris, who succeeded Frank Lorenzo as head of
Continental Airlines, said the carrier will achieve the
consistent profitability that has eluded it, but he wouldn't
predict when.
   "You look at a carrier that has $5.5 billion in revenue,"
said Mr. Harris about Continental, "its service is a good
product and it has among the lowest relative seat-mile costs.
That airline, if we operate efficiently, ought to be able to
make a profit."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The 58-year-old <PERSON>Mr. Harris</PERSON> resigned the presidency of
<ORGANIZATION>Delta Air Lines</ORGANIZATION> earlier this week to become president and
chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION>Continental Airlines Holdings Inc.</ORGANIZATION>
and head of its airline unit.
   "My goal is to aggressively move forward on a more
streamlined and simplified basis," said <PERSON>Mr. Harris</PERSON>, who
wouldn't be more specific. Asked when the carrier will see
consistent quarterly profit, he simply smiled. "In the
future," he said.
   <PERSON>Mr. Lorenzo</PERSON>, an airline executive who spent much of the
past decade embroiled in high-profile, bitter disputes with
labor, agreed to sell most of his stake in <ORGANIZATION>Continental
Holdings</ORGANIZATION> to <ORGANIZATION>Scandinavian Airlines System</ORGANIZATION> and to step down as
chairman and chief executive officer of the Houston-based
airline holding company and as head of <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>.
   "I personally have become a lightning rod for many steps
that were required to build this company to what it is
today," <PERSON>Mr. Lorenzo</PERSON> said at a <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> news conference.
   Word that <PERSON>Mr. Lorenzo</PERSON> had vacated his <ORGANIZATION>Continental Holdings</ORGANIZATION>
posts boosted the company's stock price to <MONEY>$6.25</MONEY>, up <MONEY>$1.75</MONEY>,
on volume of 2.4 million shares in trading on the <ORGANIZATION>American
Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>. The stock has suffered tremendously as the
holding company sustained massive losses, even during some of
the industry's most profitable quarters ever.
   <PERSON>Mr. Lorenzo</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jan Carlzon</PERSON>, president and chief executive
of <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION>, said the transaction would take this form: <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> would
acquire, for <MONEY>$21 million</MONEY> -- <MONEY>$10.8 million</MONEY> to <PERSON>Mr. Lorenzo</PERSON> --
all the stock outstanding in Jet Capital, a closely-held
investment vehicle that controls <ORGANIZATION>Continental Holdings</ORGANIZATION> through
a special class of stock. <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> also will pay <PERSON>Mr. Lorenzo</PERSON> <MONEY>$17
million</MONEY> for various other holdings and options, as well as
three years' salary, or another <MONEY>$2.7 million</MONEY>. <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> also will
pay <MONEY>$31.4 million</MONEY> to buy 2,250,000 <ORGANIZATION>Continental Holdings</ORGANIZATION>
shares.
   All told, <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> will increase its equity stake in
<ORGANIZATION>Continental Holdings</ORGANIZATION> to <PERCENT>16.8%</PERCENT> from the current <PERCENT>9.9%</PERCENT>. Its
voting control will be <PERCENT>18.4%</PERCENT>. Federal law bars foreign
ownership of a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> airline of more than <PERCENT>25%</PERCENT>.
   <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> would increase its representation on the 15-member
<ORGANIZATION>Continental Holdings</ORGANIZATION> board to three from one. <PERSON>Mr. Carlzon</PERSON>
would remain on the <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> board, and said he is
considering a post as its chairman, but with no operational
duties.
   The <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Transportation Department</ORGANIZATION>, which must approve the
transaction, has already requested additional financial
information. Securities analysts, however, expressed optimism
that the transaction will be cleared. They suggested that
<ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>'s case is helped by <PERSON>Mr. Lorenzo</PERSON>'s unpopularity in
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, where he has been denounced by a number of
congressmen for his acriminous relations with labor unions.
   <PERSON>Richard Hillman</PERSON>, vice president, flight operations, at
<ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>, confirmed for the carrier's pilots early
yesterday a story in The Wall Street Journal that said <PERSON>Mr.
Lorenzo</PERSON> was leaving. He added that <PERSON>Mr. Lorenzo</PERSON> "decided the
future of the company would be better served if he got his
name out of it."
   In the recorded message for the carrier's pilots, <PERSON>Mr.
Hillman</PERSON> suggested <PERSON>Mr. Lorenzo</PERSON>'s absence might mean a "better
shot" at financing for <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>'s multi-billion dollar
plane orders. "We've been having a little trouble getting
some financing for our airplanes," he added.
   A <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> spokesman wouldn't comment specifically on
what <PERSON>Mr. Hillman</PERSON> told the pilots.
   <PERSON>Mr. Harris</PERSON>'s defection from <ORGANIZATION>Delta</ORGANIZATION> surprised many. That
carrier prides itself on a family-like atmosphere that keeps
employees from jumping ship as they often do at other
airlines. All but one of <ORGANIZATION>Delta</ORGANIZATION>'s senior executives have spent
more than 20 years at the company. Under <PERSON>Mr. Lorenzo</PERSON>,
<ORGANIZATION>Continental Airlines</ORGANIZATION> had seven presidents in as many years.
   <PERSON>Mr. Harris</PERSON> spent 36 years at <ORGANIZATION>Delta</ORGANIZATION>, rising from gate agent
to president, with stops along the way in engineering,
facilities and flight operations.
   Neither, however, has he been so publicly vilified by
organized labor as was <PERSON>Mr. Lorenzo</PERSON>. Labor difficulties pushed
<ORGANIZATION>Eastern Airlines</ORGANIZATION>, then a unit of <ORGANIZATION>Continental Holdings</ORGANIZATION>'
predecessor, <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, into a crippling strike that
put the carrier into Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. A
bankruptcy court judge subsequently took control of <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION>
from <PERSON>Mr. Lorenzo</PERSON> and his management team, appointing a
trustee.
   Union leaders who watched as <PERSON>Mr. Lorenzo</PERSON> successfully
vaporized thousands of jobs and slashed wages and benefits to
the tune of <MONEY>hundreds of millions of dollars</MONEY> were celebratory
yesterday. The <ORGANIZATION>International Machinists Union</ORGANIZATION>, taking note of
a non-compete clause with <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> that keeps <PERSON>Mr. Lorenzo</PERSON> out of
the airlines business for seven years, offered "our
condolences to whatever industry he stalks next."

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   <PERSON>Frank Lorenzo</PERSON>, a central figure during a
tumultuous period in the airline industry and the bane of organized
labor, announced today he was getting out of the business.
   Lorenzo's <ORGANIZATION>Continental Airlines Holdings Inc.</ORGANIZATION> said he was selling
most of his stake in the company, formerly known as <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air
Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, to <ORGANIZATION>Scandinavian Airlines System</ORGANIZATION>. He also will quit as
chairman and chief executive but will walk away with nearly <MONEY>$30
million</MONEY> in severance payments and sale proceeds.
   Lorenzo told reporters at a <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> news briefing that he
decided to resign partly because the barrage of negative publicity
about his management practices was hurting the company's overall
performance.
   ``It's been obvious to me that I've become a lightning rod for
many of the attacks the company's taken,'' <PERSON>Lorenzo</PERSON> said. ``This
transaction allows me to step aside.''
   His departure marks the end of an era in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> airline
industry, which has undergone sweeping changes since deregulation
more than a decade ago.
   Using <MONEY>billions of dollars</MONEY> in borrowed money, cheap fares and
bankruptcy laws to restructure high-cost airlines <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> and
<ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Lorenzo</PERSON> expanded his company to the nation's biggest
airline operator with about <PERCENT>20 percent</PERCENT> of the domestic market.
   But <PERSON>Lorenzo</PERSON> has been bitterly criticized by airline unions,
which were driven from <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> and waged a bitter strike at
<ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION>.
   Both airlines are under extreme financial pressure, and doubts
are widespread about <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION>'s ability to survive.
   Lorenzo, 50, said he will be replaced as chief executive by
<PERSON>Hollis L. Harris</PERSON>, president of rival <ORGANIZATION>Delta Airlines</ORGANIZATION>. He called
<PERSON>Harris</PERSON> ``one of the industry's most experienced and highly regarded
executives.''
   <ORGANIZATION>Delta</ORGANIZATION> confirmed today that <PERSON>Harris</PERSON>, 58, left the company,
effective <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, to assume a position with <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION>Delta</ORGANIZATION>
said <PERSON>Ronald W. Allen</PERSON>, its chairman, would take on <PERSON>Harris</PERSON>' duties.
   Lorenzo will immediately get about <MONEY>$17.13 million</MONEY> in cash. He
also will get <MONEY>$2.7 million</MONEY> over three years and <MONEY>$10 million</MONEY> from
<ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> for his stake in <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>. But the <MONEY>$29.8 million</MONEY> total is
still only a franction of what he was worth a few years ago when
his airlines were in better shape.
   <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION>, which first bought a stake in <LOCATION>Lorenzo</LOCATION>'s business a few
years ago, said it was spending <MONEY>$50 million</MONEY> on the transaction,
which already was approved by <ORGANIZATION>Continental Holdings</ORGANIZATION>' board of
directors.
   Lorenzo became one of the most despised figures among union
groups in the <DATE>1980s</DATE> because of what they called his brutal
treatment of organized labor.
   The most dramatic result: a strike at <ORGANIZATION>Eastern Airlines</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>March
1989</DATE> that prompted the carrier to seek Chapter 11 bankruptcy court
protection from creditors while it reorganized.
   Lorenzo lost control of <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>April</DATE> when federal bankruptcy
judge <PERSON>Judge Burton Lifland</PERSON> placed the airline in the hands of a
trustee, <PERSON>Martin Shugrue</PERSON>.
   Following that move, <LOCATION>Lorenzo</LOCATION>'s company changed its name from
<ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION> to <ORGANIZATION>Continental Airlines Holdings</ORGANIZATION>, borrowing the name of
the airline that <PERSON>Lorenzo</PERSON> acquired in <DATE>1982</DATE> and continues to run.
   The sale of <LOCATION>Lorenzo</LOCATION>'s stake would boost <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION>'s interest in
<ORGANIZATION>Continental Holdings</ORGANIZATION> to <PERCENT>16.8 percent</PERCENT> in terms of equity and <PERCENT>18.4
percent</PERCENT> in terms of voting control. <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> already holds <PERCENT>9.8 percent</PERCENT>
of <ORGANIZATION>Continental Holdings</ORGANIZATION> and has a seat on the board.
   The transaction will require approval of the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Department of
Transportation</ORGANIZATION>. It does not appear to violate laws limiting foreign
carriers to no more than a <PERCENT>25 percent</PERCENT> stake in a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> airline.

<TEXT>
   Scandinavian Airline Systems and an unidentified
partner reportedly are involved in advanced talks with <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air
Corp.</ORGANIZATION> about buying all or part of the <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION> company's <ORGANIZATION>Continental
Airlines</ORGANIZATION> subsidiary.
   The parties have been discussing the form of a possible sale and
terms for some time, and now they have reached the point of trying
to draft a letter of intent, the Wall Street Journal reported today.
   Late last week, <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Frank Lorenzo</PERSON> said the company
may consider selling a minority or controlling interest in
<ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>. He said <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION> officials had talked to interested
parties, but he gave no details.
   Art Kent, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION>, said this morning he could
not confirm or deny the report.
   ``It's inappropriate to comment on anything like this,'' <PERSON>Kent</PERSON>
said.
   He said if discussions with an interested party ``reach a serious
point and a letter of intent is appropriate, there will be an
appropriate disclosure.''
   <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest airline holding company, also
owns strikebound <ORGANIZATION>Eastern Airlines</ORGANIZATION>. The Miami-based carrier, which is
in the midst of bankruptcy reorganization, wouldn't be involved in
any transaction involving <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION>.
   <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION>, which currently has a 9.9 percent stake in <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION> as part
of a marketing agreement, wouldn't be able to buy <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>
outright because of <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Transportation Department</ORGANIZATION> rules that
prevent foreign companies from having more than a <PERCENT>25 percent</PERCENT> share
in a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> carrier.
   Talks between the parties are an outgrowth of meetings that began
between <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> officials in <DATE>June 1988</DATE>, when the two
began work on the joint marketing agreement. Those talks turned to
<ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> possibly buying a stake in <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>, and that aspect has been
pursued with new seriousness in the past 30 days, an unidentified
source told the Journal.
   The talks apparently heated up because of signs that
Houston-based <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> could remain profitable after massive
losses in <DATE>1987</DATE> and <DATE>1988</DATE> and the soaring value of airline stocks.
   <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> is <PERCENT>50 percent</PERCENT> owned by the governments of <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Denmark</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Norway</LOCATION>. In <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, its hub is <LOCATION>Copenhagen</LOCATION>.

   The unsecured creditors of Continental Airlines Holdings
Inc. asked a bankruptcy court to let them sue Frank Lorenzo,
the former chairman who built the carrier with acquisitions
and debt, then sold his stake months before the company
sought bankruptcy-law protection.
   The creditors group charges that Mr. Lorenzo knew or
should have known that Continental Holdings was nearly
insolvent when he and another executive agreed to sell their
shares to Scandinavian Airlines System. The two executives
received $40 million in connection with that August 1990
transaction, the creditors said. Houstonbased Continental
stumbled into Chapter 11 protection the following December.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In their motion, made to <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Bankruptcy <PERSON>Judge Helen S.
Balick</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Delaware</LOCATION>, the creditors said they would seek <MONEY>$180
million</MONEY> in compensatory and punitive damages from <PERSON>Mr. Lorenzo</PERSON>
and former <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> director <PERSON>Robert Snedeker</PERSON>, who also
sold his shares. Also named was <ORGANIZATION>Jet Capital Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, a company
through which Messrs. <PERSON>Lorenzo</PERSON> and <PERSON>Snedeker</PERSON> held most of their
stake. The creditors' motion said they also want the
transaction voided. <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> wasn't named in the motion.
   The creditors also contend that the two men shaped the <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION>
transaction so that the foreign carrier bought their stake
when it decided to double its <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> stake. That
deprived <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> of an opportunity to raise capital by
selling equity to <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION>, the creditors said.
   Messrs. <PERSON>Lorenzo</PERSON> and <PERSON>Snedeker</PERSON>, in a statement, denied the
creditors' allegations. "The transactions that the creditors
are complaining about were perfectly appropriate and in the
best interests of <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>," said <PERSON>Mr. Lorenzo</PERSON>. He said he
and <PERSON>Mr. Snedeker</PERSON> have been advised by their attorneys that
the proposed creditor committee action is without merit.
   The creditors' move signals more of a "hardball" phase in
<ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>'s 14-month bankruptcy saga. It comes a week after
<ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> and its unsecured creditors' committee proposed a
consensual reorganization plan that would wipe out
shareholder equity and eliminate about <MONEY>$5 billion</MONEY> in debt.
   The creditors' group yesterday also asked <PERSON>Judge Balick</PERSON> for
permission to recover <MONEY>$124 million</MONEY> from the <ORGANIZATION>Pension Benefit
Guarantee Corp</ORGANIZATION>. The creditors maintain that <ORGANIZATION>Continental
Holdings</ORGANIZATION>' transfer of that sum to the pension plans of
<ORGANIZATION>Eastern Airlines</ORGANIZATION> was an insider transaction that should be
voided under bankruptcy court rules. At the time, <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> was
a unit of <ORGANIZATION>Continental Holdings</ORGANIZATION>, and its underfunded pension
plan was an obligation of the parent company. A <ORGANIZATION>Pension
Benefit Guarantee</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman said the federal agency is
prepared to take aggressive legal action against the
creditors' motion. "This money belongs to <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION>'s retirees
and the <ORGANIZATION>PBGC</ORGANIZATION>," she said.
   The proposed action against Messrs. <PERSON>Lorenzo</PERSON> and <PERSON>Snedeker</PERSON>
had been expected. The creditors' group had been seeking
since <DATE>December</DATE> to force the company itself to sue the two
men, and it twice altered its deadline to await <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>'s
response. The last deadline was <DATE>last Thursday</DATE>, when according
to yesterday's filing <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>'s board voted against
instituting such a suit but said it wouldn't oppose a
creditors' attempt to bring one. A <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> spokesman
declined to comment.
   In the motion, the creditors contended that Messrs.
<PERSON>Lorenzo</PERSON> and <PERSON>Snedeker</PERSON> breached their fiduciary duty when they
negotiated the <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> transaction and presented it to
<ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>'s board "as a fait accompli" in early <DATE>July 1990</DATE>.
Under the agreement, announced in <DATE>August</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> agreed to buy
2,250,000 newly issued shares of <ORGANIZATION>Continental Holdings</ORGANIZATION> common
for about <MONEY>$31 million</MONEY>. It also agreed to buy <PERCENT>100%</PERCENT> of the
stock of Jet Capital, which held a substantial block of
<ORGANIZATION>Continental Holdings</ORGANIZATION> common, for about <MONEY>$21 million</MONEY>.
   At the time, <PERSON>Messrs. Lorenzo</PERSON> and <PERSON>Snedeker</PERSON> were "consummate
insiders," holding positions as officers and directors at
both <ORGANIZATION>Continental Holdings</ORGANIZATION> and Jet Capital, the filing said,
and they owned <PERCENT>80%</PERCENT> of the latter company. As part of the <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION>
transaction, <ORGANIZATION>Continental Holdings</ORGANIZATION> paid lump sums of <MONEY>$17.1
million</MONEY> to <PERSON>Mr. Lorenzo</PERSON> and <MONEY>$3.5 million</MONEY> to <PERSON>Mr. Snedeker</PERSON>, the
filing said, as well as unpaid salary, insurance, <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>
passes and other benefits. Messrs. <PERSON>Lorenzo</PERSON> and <PERSON>Snedeker</PERSON>
agreed to step down from their <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> positions as part
of their agreement.
   A hearing on the matter is scheduled for <DATE>March 11</DATE>.

<LP>
   NEW YORK -- Frank Lorenzo, who seized on deregulation to
build one of the nation's largest airline companies in a
series of controversial mergers, is leaving the industry that
he helped transform.
   Beaten by waves of bad publicity that have swept his
latest endeavors, Mr. Lorenzo is expected to announce as
early as today that he is selling most of his stake in
Continental Airlines Holdings Inc. (formerly Texas Air Corp.)
to Scandinavian Airlines System and stepping down as chairman
and chief executive officer, say people with knowledge of the
proposed move.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Under the agreement, <PERSON>Mr. Lorenzo</PERSON> would walk away with at
least <MONEY>$17 million</MONEY>, a large sum but a fraction of what he was
worth when his airlines were flying high. Industry sources
say he didn't want to sell his stake, but believed his
continued association with the company, and criticism of his
operating style, were hurting <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>'s hopes for
recovery.
   <PERSON>Mr. Lorenzo</PERSON> has been a pioneer in the post-deregulation
airline industry, helping lead the way in merging carriers,
cutting fares and using bankruptcy protection to reorganize
and break up high-cost airlines. But his innovations brought
on debilitating labor strife, crippling debt loads and
another feature of the modern-day airline industry: service
problems.
   Now <PERSON>Mr. Lorenzo</PERSON>'s latest airline deal appears to be his
last, at least for years to come. The proposed purchase would
raise <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION>'s interest in <ORGANIZATION>Continental Holdings</ORGANIZATION> to <PERCENT>16.8%</PERCENT> in
terms of equity and <PERCENT>18.4%</PERCENT> in terms of voting control. <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION>
already owns <PERCENT>9.8%</PERCENT> of <ORGANIZATION>Continental Holdings</ORGANIZATION>, and has a seat on
the company's board.
   SAS is said to be spending about <MONEY>$50 million</MONEY> on the
transaction, and is planning to install <PERSON>Hollis Harris</PERSON>, 58,
the president of <ORGANIZATION>Delta Air Lines</ORGANIZATION>, as president and CEO of
both <ORGANIZATION>Continental Holdings</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Continental Airlines</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>Jan
Carlzon</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION>'s chairman and a <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> director, would
become nonexecutive chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Continental Holdings</ORGANIZATION>. The
transaction requires approval from the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Department of
Transportation</ORGANIZATION> but doesn't violate laws governing how big a
piece a foreign carrier may own of a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> airline. That limit
currently is <PERCENT>25%</PERCENT>.
   A <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> spokesman declined to comment on the
proposed transaction. <PERSON>Lars Bergvall</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION>'s chief operating
officer, said he had no comment.
   Under the agreement, <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> will buy out <PERSON>Mr. Lorenzo</PERSON>'s
five-year employment contract, which calls for a base salary
of <MONEY>$365,000</MONEY> a year plus bonuses and deferred compensation of
at least <MONEY>$570,000</MONEY>. SAS is also buying all the shares of <ORGANIZATION>Jet
Capital Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, a personal investment company owned by <PERSON>Mr.
Lorenzo</PERSON> and two other investors, who are selling their stakes
as well. Jet Capital's chief investment is in <ORGANIZATION>Continental
Holdings</ORGANIZATION> shares. Since there is no public market for Jet
Capital shares, their value lies in the voting power they
exert over <ORGANIZATION>Continental Holdings</ORGANIZATION>.
   Finally, <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> plans to purchase, at a premium, <PERSON>Mr.
Lorenzo</PERSON>'s options to buy two million or more <ORGANIZATION>Continental
Holdings</ORGANIZATION> shares. <PERSON>Mr. Lorenzo</PERSON> will retain some of those
options and will remain on the board of directors. Under a
non-compete clause in his employment contract, <PERSON>Mr. Lorenzo</PERSON> is
obliged to stay out of the airline business for at least
seven years.
   The transaction has already received approval from the
board of <ORGANIZATION>Continental Holdings</ORGANIZATION>, sources familiar with the
transaction say.
   <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> is paying <MONEY>$14</MONEY> a share for 2.25 million <ORGANIZATION>Continental
Holdings</ORGANIZATION> shares, almost all of which come from <PERSON>Mr. Lorenzo</PERSON>
and his two Jet Capital partners. That price is sure to sting
other common holders who have watched <ORGANIZATION>Continental Holdings</ORGANIZATION>
shares slide to yesterday's close of <MONEY>$4.50</MONEY> a share on the
<ORGANIZATION>American Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>, down from about <MONEY>$23</MONEY> a year ago. <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION>
apparently chose to pay the premium in order to get the
additional voting rights that Jet Capital holds. There are
about 40 million <ORGANIZATION>Continental Holdings</ORGANIZATION> shares outstanding.
   Controversy is certainly nothing new to <PERSON>Mr. Lorenzo</PERSON> where
airlines are concerned. Over the last three years, the
50-year-old executive has been routinely vilified by <ORGANIZATION>Eastern
Airlines</ORGANIZATION> unions as they mounted a tough campaign to fight his
attempts to lower labor costs at that former unit. The result
was a bruising strike begun in <DATE>March 1989</DATE> that virtually
grounded <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> and sent that carrier careening into Chapter
11 bankruptcy proceedings, from which it still hasn't
emerged.
   Last <DATE>April</DATE>, the bankruptcy court judge, <PERSON>Burton R. Lifland</PERSON>,
took control of <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> from <PERSON>Mr. Lorenzo</PERSON>, placing the carrier
in the hands of a trustee, <ORGANIZATION>Martin Shugrue Jr</ORGANIZATION>.
   That entire episode so demoralized the <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION> empire
that it sought to distance itself from its past, changing its
name and severing all ties to <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION>. The body blows from
the <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> affair also led to <PERSON>Mr. Lorenzo</PERSON>'s decision to
leave the airline business, according to people who know him.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> episode, which included critical headlines and
pickets outside <PERSON>Mr. Lorenzo</PERSON>'s exclusive River Oaks home in
<LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION>, took a considerable toll on the intensely private
man and his family. He took to hiring bodyguards.
   That was in marked contrast to the <PERSON>Frank Lorenzo</PERSON> who
wrested control of <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1982</DATE> in the nation's first
hostile takeover of an airline. <PERSON>Mr. Lorenzo</PERSON>, a graduate of
<ORGANIZATION>Harvard University</ORGANIZATION>'s business school, had been looking for
ways to expand his <ORGANIZATION>Texas International Airlines</ORGANIZATION>, a small
regional carrier. At the time, <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> was a staid
carrier and money-loser.
   Within four years, <PERSON>Mr. Lorenzo</PERSON> had thrust the airline into
bankruptcy court, abrogated its union contracts and lowered
labor costs. He built back its operations until, in <DATE>1986</DATE>, it
emerged from Chapter 11 protection having turned a profit.
   With low costs, <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> lured flyers by offering lower
fares, and a new generation of travelers took to the skies.
   But the growth of <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> itself has been anything but
steady, and <PERSON>Mr. Lorenzo</PERSON> discovered it was easier to build an
airline than to run it. <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>'s top management has been
in constant turmoil, with seven chief executives in as many
years.
   But that didn't stop the acquisition-minded <PERSON>Mr. Lorenzo</PERSON>.
Riding high on deregulation, he and his <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air Corp.</ORGANIZATION> went
on to acquire <ORGANIZATION>People Express</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Frontier</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION>, all of
which were financially troubled. <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION> already owned <ORGANIZATION>New
York Air</ORGANIZATION>. In <DATE>1987</DATE>, <PERSON>Mr. Lorenzo</PERSON> folded all the airlines,
except for <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION>, into <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>, a merger that became
one of the airline industry's most difficult and costly.
   <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>'s expansion, funded by junk bonds, was driven
by an ever-growing mound of debt, and was shaky at best. With
his new holdings, <PERSON>Mr. Lorenzo</PERSON>'s empire -- briefly the largest
airline in the free world -- began to feel the full weight of
its debt: <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION> rolled up . . . the airline industry's
largest losses ever in <DATE>1988</DATE> and <DATE>1989</DATE> -- <MONEY>$718.6 million</MONEY> and
<MONEY>$885.6 million</MONEY>, respectively.
   <PERSON>Mr. Lorenzo</PERSON> eventually broke the strike at <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION>, but
lost the airline. The labor action, mounted by <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION>'s
machinists and supported by flight attendants and pilots, not
only forced <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> into Chapter 11 protection but kept <PERSON>Mr.
Lorenzo</PERSON> in the spotlight: Angry strikers picketed the
nation's airports, handing out buttons and bumper stickers
emblazoned with the words, "Stop Lorenzo."
   But unlike his experience with <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Lorenzo</PERSON>
would not ride <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> out of bankruptcy. After listening to
ever-smaller offers of repayment, <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION>'s creditors ousted
<PERSON>Mr. Lorenzo</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION> from day-to-day control of <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION> changed its name to <ORGANIZATION>Continental Airlines
Holdings Inc.</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>June</DATE>. But the parent still is on the hook
for <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION>'s pension debt, which could total nearly half a
<MONEY>billion dollars</MONEY>. While <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> has made a dramatic
financial turnaround from last year and the year before, much
of its net income comes from one-time gains such as lawsuit
settlements and asset sales. Its debt service costs remain
high, and eat up much of its operating profits.
   For its part, <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> is <PERCENT>50%</PERCENT> owned by the governments of
<LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Denmark</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Norway</LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION>'s initial purchase of a <PERCENT>10%</PERCENT>
stake in <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>, as well as a marketing agreement with
the carrier back in <DATE>October 1988</DATE>, has yielded many benefits.
Passenger traffic between <DATE>May</DATE> and <DATE>December 1989</DATE> was up <PERCENT>40%</PERCENT>
out of <LOCATION>Stockholm</LOCATION> and <PERCENT>100%</PERCENT> out of <LOCATION>Oslo</LOCATION>, mostly because of
transfers at <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>Newark</LOCATION> hub.
   The company in recent years has undertaken a broad
expansion program, of which <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> is just a part.
   It now has equity stakes in <ORGANIZATION>Inter-Continental Hotels Corp.</ORGANIZATION>
(<PERCENT>40%</PERCENT>), <ORGANIZATION>Finnair</ORGANIZATION> (estimated <PERCENT>6%</PERCENT>) and <ORGANIZATION>Swissair</ORGANIZATION> (<PERCENT>5%</PERCENT> to <PERCENT>10%</PERCENT>, to be
finalized by the end of <DATE>1991</DATE>). It bought a <PERCENT>24.9%</PERCENT> stake in
<ORGANIZATION>Airlines of Britain PLC</ORGANIZATION> and <PERCENT>35%</PERCENT> in <LOCATION>LAN Chile</LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> also is in
the market for as many as 126 new MD-90s or A-320/A-321s
airplanes.
   Like other European carriers in highwage home markets, <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION>
is having problems with costs. <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> has a hiring freeze and
has sold some ancillary businesses. Now its ambitious
expansion plans are being scaled back. <PERSON>Lars Bergvall</PERSON>, the
chief operating officer, said planned additions to the
airline's <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Seattle</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> routes will be
scrapped, as will some other proposed route additions. <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION>
has frozen its European fleet at its current size, and three
DC-9s are being sold earlier than planned.

suit against Lorenzo

CREDITORS of <ORGANIZATION>Continental Airlines</ORGANIZATION>, the fifth largest <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> carrier and one in
bankruptcy since <DATE>late 1990</DATE>, have filed a suit against <PERSON>Mr Frank Lorenzo</PERSON>, the
airline's former chairman and chief executive. The suit, brought by the
official creditors' committee, claims Dollars 180m in damages.
<PERSON>Mr Lorenzo</PERSON>, known as a pugnacious union-buster and wily deal-maker, quit as
<ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>'s boss in <DATE>August 1990</DATE>, although he remained a director. At that
stage, he also sold the privately-owned Jet Capital company - in which he
and other Jet Capital directors had an 80 per cent stake - to <ORGANIZATION>Scandinavian
Airlines System</ORGANIZATION>.
Jet Capital, in turn, held a big stake in <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> ended up with
18.4 per cent of <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>'s voting rights.
However, before the end of <DATE>1990</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> had sought protection under
Chapter 11 of the US Bankruptcy Code - a situation which still exists,
although the airline has now filed a reorganisation scheme with the courts.
Under this proposed plan, ordinary shareholders in the airline would get
nothing - rendering <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION>'s equity stake worthless.
The creditors' lawsuit alleges that <PERSON>Mr Lorenzo</PERSON>, Jet Capital and <PERSON>Mr Robert
Snedeker</PERSON>, another <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> director, received Dollars 41.6m as a result
of the series of transactions with <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>August 1990</DATE>. It suggests that the
payments were made when <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> was already insolvent, breaching <PERSON>Mr
Lorenzo</PERSON>'s and <PERSON>Mr Snedeker</PERSON>'s duties as directors of the company. It also
argues that <PERSON>Mr Lorenzo</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mr Snedeker</PERSON> benefited from a preferential
transfer which preceded the <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> deal.
The creditors' committee stressed that <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> was not a defendant in the suit.
Lawyers said the suit alleged a mixture of fraudulent conveyance, breaches
of fiduciary duty and preferential transfer.
<PERSON>Mr Lorenzo</PERSON>'s Houston-based investment company said the businessman believed
the actions cited in the creditors' complaint were 'perfectly appropriate
and in the best interests of <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>'. It added that <PERSON>Mr Lorenzo</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mr
Snedeker</PERSON> has been advised by lawyers that the suit was 'totally without
merit'.

<TEXT>
   Airline boss <PERSON>Frank Lorenzo</PERSON> said <DATE>Thursday</DATE> he's
quitting the flying empire he built in the <DATE>1980s</DATE>, hurt by a barrage
of bad publicity and labor bitterness about his tough-guy
management style.
   The 50-year-old entrepreneur, who came to symbolize a tumultuous
decade of airline deregulation, is selling most of his stake in
<ORGANIZATION>Continental Airlines Holdings Inc.</ORGANIZATION> to <ORGANIZATION>Scandinavian Airlines System</ORGANIZATION>.
The leading foreign carrier has held a small stake in Houston-based
<ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> for two years.
   Lorenzo also is resigning as chairman and chief executive, to be
replaced by <ORGANIZATION>Delta Air Lines Inc</ORGANIZATION>. President <PERSON>Hollis L. Harris</PERSON>.
<PERSON>Harris</PERSON>, a highly respected manager, was lured to <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> after
a discreet search that started four months ago.
   Lorenzo will receive nearly <MONEY>$30 million</MONEY> in severance, retain a
small interest in <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>'s stock options and keep a seat on
the company's board of directors.
   But <PERSON>Lorenzo</PERSON>'s influence in running the company virtually will
disappear and his compensation reflects a fraction of the value the
airline operation used to have in better times.
   Houston-based <ORGANIZATION>Continental Holdings</ORGANIZATION>, formerly known as <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air
Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, once commanded <PERCENT>20 percent</PERCENT> of the domestic airline market
through its ownership of <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> airlines.
   But its business has been severely crimped by heavy debts and a
debilitating strike at <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> that's now 17 months old. Last year
the parent company lost <MONEY>$885.6 million</MONEY>, an industry record.
   ``It's been perfectly obvious to me that I personally have
become a lightning rod for many of the attacks that the company has
taken in the process of making the changes that have been
required,'' <PERSON>Lorenzo</PERSON> said.
   ``This transaction allows me to step aside and allows the
company to have a new management,'' he said. Asked what he would do
now, <PERSON>Lorenzo</PERSON> said, ``Take a little time to catch my breath. I
haven't had much time to do that.''
   He spoke to reporters at a <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> news briefing, flanked by
<PERSON>Hollis</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Jan Carlzon</PERSON>. All three called the
arrangement a strategic move that would strengthen <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> into
a global airline for the <DATE>1990s</DATE>.
   <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION>, which is spending a total of <MONEY>$50 million</MONEY> in the deal, will
roughly double its stake to <PERCENT>18.4 percent</PERCENT> of the company's voting
stock. <PERSON>Carlzon</PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> had no interest in gaining control of the
airline. Federal law already limits foreign ownership is limited to
<PERCENT>25 percent</PERCENT>.
   ``We think <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> has an interesting future,'' <PERSON>Carlzon</PERSON>
said. ``It's better to have <PERCENT>18.4 percent</PERCENT> than 9.9 percent.''
   Wall Street reacted positively to the announcement, reflecting
investor optimism that the change would help <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>'s business
improve.
   Its stock, which traded as high as <MONEY>$23.75</MONEY> a share over the past
year but recently traded in the <MONEY>$4-5</MONEY> range, rose <MONEY>$1.75</MONEY> on the
<ORGANIZATION>American Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> in active trading to <MONEY>$6.75</MONEY>.
   Lorenzo's exit from the airline world marks the end of an era
that in many ways was shaped by him. From his initial plunge into
the flying business in the <DATE>1960s</DATE> as an analyst for <ORGANIZATION>Trans World
Airlines</ORGANIZATION> and later as an executive of a small <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> airline
company, <PERSON>Lorenzo</PERSON> helped pioneer innovations ranging from cut-rate
fares to the industry's first hostile takeover.
   But <PERSON>Lorenzo</PERSON> aroused labor hatred because of what unions called
his brutal tactics to cut employee costs, one of the biggest
expenses in the industry besides fuel.
   Lorenzo called his strategies necessary to stay profitable in
deregulated skies that allowed airlines to set their own fares and
fly wherever they wished _ enormous changes in an industry unused
to competition.
   His war with labor began after he won <ORGANIZATION>Continental Airlines</ORGANIZATION> in a
takeover bid in <DATE>1981</DATE>. Two years later he plunged the airline into
bankruptcy court, scrapped union contracts and hired low-cost
replacements for striking workers.
   Lorenzo's reputation among unionists worsened after he bought
unprofitable <ORGANIZATION>Eastern Airlines</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1986</DATE>. Three years later angry
unions struck, accusing Lorenzo of gutting the airline.
   He responded by placing <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> in bankruptcy court, but its
enormous debts and enduring strike crippled the carrier and made
creditors increasingly edgy. Last <DATE>April</DATE> an irritated federal
bankruptcy judge gave control of <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> to a trustee, which many
strikers regarded as vindication.
   Unionists reacted to <LOCATION>Lorenzo</LOCATION>'s announcement <DATE>Thursday</DATE> with a mix
of satisfaction and resentment. The <ORGANIZATION>International Association of
Machinists</ORGANIZATION>, which has led the <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> strike from the start, said
he was largely responsible for the problems in his company.
   ``<PERSON>Frank Lorenzo</PERSON> demolished <ORGANIZATION>Eastern Airlines</ORGANIZATION>, wreaked havoc on
thousands of workers' lives and severely devalued <ORGANIZATION>Continental
Airlines</ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON>John Peterpaul</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>IAM</ORGANIZATION> general vice president.
``Those facts dampen our elation at seeing Lorenzo finally leaving
the industry. He is the epitome of what is wrong with corporate
<LOCATION>America</LOCATION> today.
   ``Our condolences to whatever industry he stalks next.''

payments were made when <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> was already insolvent, breaching <PERSON>Mr
Lorenzo</PERSON>'s and <PERSON>Mr Snedeker</PERSON>'s duties as directors of the company. It also
argues that <PERSON>Mr Lorenzo</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mr Snedeker</PERSON> benefited from a preferential
transfer which preceded the <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> deal.
The creditors' committee stressed that <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> was not a defendant in the suit.
Lawyers said the suit alleged a mixture of fraudulent conveyance, breaches
of fiduciary duty and preferential transfer.
<PERSON>Mr Lorenzo</PERSON> <TIME>last night</TIME> was unavailable for comment.

<HEAD>SAS Reportedly Interested in Buying Continental</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: ADDS 10 grafs to UPDATE with analyst, union comment on possible
Continental sale.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, which is considering a sale of
part or all of its <ORGANIZATION>Continental Airlines</ORGANIZATION> subsidiary, reportedly is
involved in advanced talks about such a transaction with
<ORGANIZATION>Scandinavian Airlines System</ORGANIZATION> and an unidentified partner.
   Talks about the form of a possible sale and the terms have been
going on for some time, and the parties have reached the point of
trying to draft a letter of intent, the Wall Street Journal reported
in <DATE>Monday</DATE>'s editions.
   A <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION> spokesman, however, would not confirm that any such
talks have taken place.
   ``I can't confirm or deny anything,'' spokesman Art Kent told <ORGANIZATION>The
Associated Press</ORGANIZATION>. ``It's inappropriate to comment on anything like
this.''
   Kent said if discussions with an interested party ``reach a
serious point and a letter of intent is appropriate, there will be
an appropriate disclosure.''
   <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Frank Lorenzo</PERSON> announced last <DATE>Thursday</DATE> that the
Houston-based airline company _ the largest in the nation _ may
consider selling a minority or controlling interest in <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Strikebound Eastern Airlines</ORGANIZATION> is <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION>'s other airline
subsidiary, but it would not be involved in any <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>
transaction.
   Lorenzo said <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION> officials have spoken to parties
interested in <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>, but he has not provided any details about
the talks.
   <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> already has a <PERCENT>9.9 percent</PERCENT> stake in <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION> as part of a
marketing agreement.
   If <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> is interested in buying part of Houston-based <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>,
the transaction would have to be structured in such a way that <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION>
would get a minority holding. <ORGANIZATION>Department of Transportation</ORGANIZATION> rules
prevent foreign companies from having more than a <PERCENT>25 percent</PERCENT> stake
in a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> carrier.
   Talks that began in <DATE>June 1988</DATE> concerning the <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION> marketing
agreement apparently turned to <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> possibly buying part of
<ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>. That aspect has been pursued with new seriousness in
the past 30 days, an unidentified source told the Journal.
   Signs that <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> could remain profitable after massive
losses in <DATE>1987</DATE> and <DATE>1988</DATE>, as well as the soaring value of airline
stocks, apparently heated up the discussions.
   Lorenzo's surprise announcement came a week after a <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>
investment firm disclosed that it holds <PERCENT>12 percent</PERCENT> of <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Loomis, Sayles &amp; Co.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> portfolio management company, has
said its <PERCENT>12 percent</PERCENT> stake was held for investment because it
believed <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION> would show a profit in <DATE>1990</DATE>.
   The possible sale of <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> could doom <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION>, according to
securities analysts and labor leaders.
   Miami-based <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> is in the sixth month of a strike by
<ORGANIZATION>Machinists</ORGANIZATION> union members, pilots and flight attendants, and is
flying about a third of its pre-strike 1,100 daily flights.
   ``We've always believed that the plan was to shrink <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> and
roll it into <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON>Louis A. Marchesano</PERSON>, an analyst
with the <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> brokerage <ORGANIZATION>Janney Montgomery Scott Inc</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``The sale of <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> would mean <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> would have to make
it on its own,'' <PERSON>Marchesano</PERSON> said <DATE>Monday</DATE>, ``and the risk of a
shrunken <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> not making it is substantial.''
   Eastern, which filed for Chapter 11 protection from bankruptcy
shortly after the walkout began in <DATE>March</DATE>, is losing more than <MONEY>$1.5
million</MONEY> a day.
   The sale of <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>, according to <PERSON>Marchesano</PERSON>, would mean
Lorenzo ``might be leaving the airline business.''
   The <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION>Air Line Pilots Association</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Ron
Cole</PERSON>, agreed, saying that the <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION> chairman ``may be cutting
and running.''
   A <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION> without <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Cole</PERSON> said, would have only two
options _ continued liquidation of <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> assets or the outright
sale of the carrier.
   Striking <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> employees have repeatedly charged that <PERSON>Lorenzo</PERSON>
has been transferring <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> assets to <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>, weakening
<ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> and strengthening <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``Now that the bankruptcy has thrown a net around <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION>'s
assets and stopped the upstreaming of cash,'' <PERSON>Cole</PERSON> said, ``Lorenzo
has to admit that <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> can't go it alone, that it can't
survive without sponging off Eastern.''

FT  04 MAY 91 / International Company News: Continental Air seeks extra
Dollars 3bn

<TEXT>
CONTINENTAL AIRLINES, one of the five largest <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> carriers, is seeking more
than Dollars 3bn in fresh equity and cash to restructure its debt-burdened
balance-sheet and help it out of bankruptcy in the next eight to 12 months.
<PERSON>Mr Hollis Harris</PERSON>, the new chairman of the airline which filed for protection
from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the US Bankruptcy Code last <DATE>December</DATE>,
said he was seeking the conversion of about Dollars 2bn of unsecured debt
into equity.
The airline currently has total unsecured debts of Dollars 2.5bn and secured
debts of Dollars 4.5bn.
<PERSON>Mr Harris</PERSON>, the former <ORGANIZATION>Delta Airlines</ORGANIZATION> president brought in to rescue
<ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>, said it was planning to raise an additional Dollars 600m in new
equity from three or four investor groups.
The company has had discussions with business representatives at its three
<LOCATION>US</LOCATION> hubs of <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Newark</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION>.
At the same time, <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> is in advanced talks to sell a controlling
interest in its <LOCATION>Air Micronesia</LOCATION> operation in the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> for about Dollars
300m. But <PERSON>Mr Harris</PERSON> emphasised <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> would continue to be closely
involved in the operation in which it intended to retain a 49 per cent
interest.
The airline is also expecting to raise about Dollars 80m this year from the
sale of its Chelsea air catering company. It has already sold its <LOCATION>Seattle</LOCATION> to
<LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> route to <ORGANIZATION>American Airlines for Dollars</ORGANIZATION> 150m.
All these transactions coupled with the restructuring of the company
aircraft operating and capital leases are designed to reconstruct the
company's balance sheet and provide additional capital to expand the
airline.
<PERSON>Mr Harris</PERSON> stressed that <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> had to find a way not to shrink its
operations. The airline has 350 aircraft in its fleet and has 190 new <ORGANIZATION>Boeing</ORGANIZATION>
and <ORGANIZATION>Airbus</ORGANIZATION> jets on order.
'We must grow the airline as we come out of Chapter 11 (protection). We
cannot cut back. We have to grow and maintain market share if we are to
compete with the other big carriers,' he said.
But he acknowledged that the financial restructuring if successful was
likely to dilute significantly current shareholders' equity. This would
include <ORGANIZATION>Scandinavian Airlines System</ORGANIZATION> (SAS) which currently owns 16.8 per
cent of <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> shares and 18.3 per cent of voting rights.
'Their holding will automatically be reduced significantly under the
restructuring,' <PERSON>Mr Harris</PERSON> said. But he added that he expected <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> to invest
additional funds in <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>. 'We have a good relationship and I believe
they want to be a partner with us,' <PERSON>Mr Harris</PERSON> said.
<ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> reported this week a sizeable <DATE>first-quarter</DATE> loss of Dollars
194.8m compared with a Dollars 21.3m profit in the same quarter last year.

   Scandinavian Airline Systems and an unidentified partner are the investors interested in buying all or part of <ORGANIZATION>Continental Airlines</ORGANIZATION> from <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, and talks are at an advanced stage, according to those familiar with the situation. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON>Frank Lorenzo</PERSON> disclosed late last week that he would consider selling a stake in the <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> unit, but didn't give any details. 

   A spokesman for <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Stockholm</LOCATION> refused to comment, as did a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION>Houston-based Texas Air</ORGANIZATION>. 

   It's still not known who <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION>'s partner is, how much money may be involved or what percentage of ownership in <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> is being discussed. 

   But the parties have been discussing the form of a possible sale and terms for some time, and now have reached the point of trying to draft a letter of intent, according to one source. 
Currently, <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> holds a <PERCENT>9.9%</PERCENT> stake in <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION> as part of the marketing arrangement with <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION> announced last fall. 

   The talks are an outgrowth of meetings that began between <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> officials in <DATE>June 1988</DATE>, when the two began work on the joint marketing agreement. 
Those talks turned to <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> and its partner possibly buying a stake in <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>, and that aspect has been pursued with new seriousness in the past 30 days, the source said. 

   It is understood that the talks heated up of late because of signs that <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> could remain profitable after massive losses in <DATE>1987</DATE> and <DATE>1988</DATE> and the soaring value of airline stocks. 
Most airline stocks have taken off this year in the wake of a <MONEY>$3.5 billion</MONEY> buy-out of <ORGANIZATION>NWA Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Northwest Airlines</ORGANIZATION>' parent, and a <MONEY>$6.19 billion</MONEY> offer for <ORGANIZATION>UAL Corp</ORGANIZATION>, parent of <ORGANIZATION>United Airlines</ORGANIZATION>. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION>'s stock price has doubled since <DATE>Jan. 1</DATE>, but Wall Street appeared to react cautiously to the disclosure that <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION> might sell a piece or all of <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>. 
In <ORGANIZATION>American Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading <DATE>Friday</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION> rose only <MONEY>87.5 cents</MONEY> to <MONEY>$20.875</MONEY>, on volume of 2,117,000 shares. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Eastern Airlines</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION>'s other airline unit, now in bankruptcy proceedings, wouldn't be involved in any <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> transaction. 
From time to time there has been speculation that <PERSON>Mr. Lorenzo</PERSON> might eventually try to merge <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> with ailing <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION>, which is trying to revive its flight operations after a bitter strike that led to its bankruptcy filing in <DATE>March</DATE>. 

   <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> itself wouldn't be able to buy <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> outright because of <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Transportation Department</ORGANIZATION> rules that prevent foreign companies from having more than a <PERCENT>25%</PERCENT> stake in a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> airline. 
So, any transaction that might come of current talks would have to be structured in a way that <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> has a minority holding. 

   That means if a deal is pursued, its structure might be similar to the sale last month of <ORGANIZATION>NWA</ORGANIZATION>, according to someone familiar with the SAS-Texas Air talks. 
<LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> investor <PERSON>Alfred Checchi</PERSON> bought <ORGANIZATION>NWA</ORGANIZATION> with some equity financing from <ORGANIZATION>KLM Royal Dutch Airlines</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Elders IXL Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>, who contributed <MONEY>$480 million</MONEY>. 
The two foreign airlines came out with less than <PERCENT>20%</PERCENT> of the voting interest in the new company because most of their stake is held in preferred stock. 

   <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION>'s purchase of its <PERCENT>9.9%</PERCENT> stake in parent <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION> <DATE>last year</DATE> was a friendly transaction. 
SAS paid <MONEY>$56 million</MONEY> for the stock, and agreed to pay <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION> an additional <MONEY>$50 million</MONEY> over several months as the agreement goes into effect. 
<ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON>Jan Carlzon</PERSON> also sits on <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION>'s board. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Carlzon</PERSON> apparently believes he made the right decision to link up with <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>, according to one person who discussed the move with him recently. 
But, that source said, in the same conversation <PERSON>Mr. Carlzon</PERSON> conceded that he was concerned about the negative view many people have of the tough-minded <PERSON>Mr. Lorenzo</PERSON>, his <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION> empire, and <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION>. 
Separating <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> from <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> might solve part of that problem for <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION>. 

   <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> is <PERCENT>50%</PERCENT>-owned by the governments of <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Denmark</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Norway</LOCATION>. 
In <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, its hub is <LOCATION>Copenhagen</LOCATION>. 
Since purchasing the <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION> stake last <DATE>October</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> has operated in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> out of <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>'s new terminal at <LOCATION>Newark</LOCATION> international airport in <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION>. 
The two airlines coordinate schedules, frequent-flier programs and sales forces. 
<ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> also runs a training program for <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>. 

   SAS is preparing for the competition expected in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> after market barriers come down there in <DATE>1992</DATE>. 
Anticipating a frenzy of activity similar to what occurred in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> after deregulation, <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> is seeking alliances that may bring it passengers. 
Since <DATE>October</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> has bought <PERCENT>24.9%</PERCENT> of <ORGANIZATION>Airlines of Britain PLC</ORGANIZATION>, owner of four <LOCATION>U.K.</LOCATION> carriers and <PERCENT>40%</PERCENT> of <ORGANIZATION>Intercontinental Hotels Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, from <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Seibu/Saison Group</ORGANIZATION>. 

   <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> also is backing an investor group trying to buy <PERCENT>51%</PERCENT> of Chilean flag carrier LAN <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION> from the Chilean government. 
<ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> options could give it <PERCENT>35%</PERCENT> of that carrier by <DATE>1991</DATE>. 
<ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> has loose marketing agreements with <ORGANIZATION>Thai Airways International and All Nippon Airways</ORGANIZATION> and owns <PERCENT>25%</PERCENT> of the European Amadeus computer reservations system.

<TEXT>
   <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air Corp</ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON>Frank Lorenzo</PERSON> has met
with <PERSON>Donald J. Trump</PERSON> in an effort to persuade the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> developer
to buy <ORGANIZATION>Continental Airlines</ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION>Trump</ORGANIZATION> associate said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
   ``<PERSON>Mr. Lorenzo</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mr. Trump</PERSON> have spoken,'' said <PERSON>Bruce Nobles</PERSON>,
president of <ORGANIZATION>Trump Shuttle</ORGANIZATION>, which the developer purchased from
<LOCATION>Lorenzo</LOCATION> <DATE>last June</DATE> for <MONEY>$365 million</MONEY>.
   But <PERSON>Trump</PERSON> has concerns about a potential purchase of <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>,
a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Nobles</PERSON> said, noting that <ORGANIZATION>Trump</ORGANIZATION> is
concerned about <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>'s <MONEY>$2.5 billion</MONEY> debt, its small cash
reserves and the need to refurbish many of its planes.
   While <PERSON>Trump</PERSON> remains interested and believes his name would help
the Houston-based carrier win passengers, he has not been convinced
that the risks are acceptable, <PERSON>Nobles</PERSON> said in a telephone interview.
   ``His (<ORGANIZATION>Trump</ORGANIZATION>'s) concerns are well put,'' said <PERSON>Nobles</PERSON>, a former
<ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Pan Am Corp.</ORGANIZATION> official.
   Trump was unavailable for comment <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, a spokesman said.
Art Kent, a <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION>, said <PERSON>Lorenzo</PERSON> had no
comment on the matter.
   In talks with <ORGANIZATION>Trump</ORGANIZATION>, said to have been held over the past month,
<PERSON>Lorenzo</PERSON> said his negative image has hurt <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>, according to
sources quoted in <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>'s editions of the <ORGANIZATION>New York Times</ORGANIZATION>.
   Lorenzo announced last <DATE>Thursday</DATE> that Houston-based <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION>, the
nation's largest airline company, may consider selling a minority or
controlling interest in <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Strikebound Eastern Airlines</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION>'s other airline
subsidiary, apparently would not be involved in any <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>
transaction.
   Last week, <PERSON>Lorenzo</PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION>The Associated Press</ORGANIZATION> that one reason he
was considering selling a stake in <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> was that the bitter
struggle with <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION>'s unions had hurt traffic at <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION> is also involved in talks about selling a major stake
in <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> to <ORGANIZATION>Scandinavian Airlines System</ORGANIZATION> and an unidentified
partner, The Wall Street Journal reported <DATE>Monday</DATE>. <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION> declined
to comment on the report.
   <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> already has a <PERCENT>9.9 percent</PERCENT> stake in <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION> as part of a
joint marketing agreement.
   Sources were quoted by the Times as saying that <PERSON>Lorenzo</PERSON> was
impressed with the way traffic on the former <ORGANIZATION>Eastern Air Shuttle</ORGANIZATION> in
the <LOCATION>Northeast</LOCATION> picked up since <ORGANIZATION>Trump</ORGANIZATION> bought it.
   Trump's share of the lucrative <ORGANIZATION>Northeast</ORGANIZATION> shuttle market, split
with <ORGANIZATION>Pan Am</ORGANIZATION>, has ``approximately doubled since we took over,''
<PERSON>Nobles</PERSON> said. Although he declined to give precise figures, he said
<ORGANIZATION>Trump Shuttle</ORGANIZATION>'s market share has jumped from around <PERCENT>25 percent</PERCENT> when
it started operations in <DATE>early June</DATE> to about <PERCENT>50 percent</PERCENT> currently.
   ``I think being separated from <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> is a positive; having the
<PERSON>Trump</PERSON> name is a positive; having better service is a positive,''
<PERSON>Nobles</PERSON> said.
   But rival <ORGANIZATION>Pan Am</ORGANIZATION> disputed <PERSON>Nobles</PERSON>' estimate of current market
share. <ORGANIZATION>Pan Am</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON>Pamela Hanlon</PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION>Pan Am Shuttle</ORGANIZATION>'s
share, at around <PERCENT>75 percent</PERCENT> when <PERSON>Trump</PERSON> started up, is now holding at
roughly <PERCENT>60 percent</PERCENT>.
   ``We're quite pleased with the clientele that we think we've been
able to keep since they started,'' she said.
   The Times quoted its sources as saying that <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> favored a deal
with <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> involving <ORGANIZATION>Trump</ORGANIZATION>.
   <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> board member <PERSON>Kaj Ikast</PERSON> said <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> that the carrier was not
near a decision on taking a stake in <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>. Ikast told the
Times there have been talks with <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION> about buying such a stake.

<TEXT>
   A team of lawyers spent the weekend preparing a
Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing for <ORGANIZATION>Continental Airlines</ORGANIZATION>, but the
carrier's board is split on how to deal with its financial
troubles, according to a published report.
   In its <DATE>early Wednesday</DATE> edition, The <ORGANIZATION>New York Times</ORGANIZATION> quotes an
attorney, who spoke on condition of anonymity, as saying the papers
were ready to be filed in bankruptcy court <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME>.
   The airline denied the report.
   ``The company has no intention of filing for bankruptcy
protection,'' said <PERSON>Art Kent</PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> suffered losses during the normally busy <DATE>summer</DATE>
travel season and has been hurt by higher fuel prices since the
Iraqi invasion of <LOCATION>Kuwait</LOCATION>, the newspaper said.
   <PERSON>Frank Lorenzo</PERSON>, who recently stepped down as chairman of
<ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> but remains on the board, opposes a Chapter 11 filing
by the airline, the <ORGANIZATION>Times</ORGANIZATION> said. Also, <PERSON>Jan Carlzon</PERSON>, chairman of
<ORGANIZATION>Scandavian Airlines System</ORGANIZATION>, which owns <PERCENT>16.8 percent</PERCENT> of <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>
stock, opposes filing for bankruptcy, the newspaper quoted the
lawyer as saying.
   A filing would reduce the value of <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION>'s holdings.
   The newspaper said it was not clear which board members support
filing for bankruptcy protection.
   On <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> said it has moved to cut costs by
restructuring its senior management team, cutting five top
executives.
   The board of directors for the Houston-based airline approved
the restructuring plan on <DATE>Monday</DATE>.
   ``With radically higher fuel costs, <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> must become a
stronger competitor in the global marketplace,'' said <PERSON>Hollis
Harris</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>'s chairman and chief executive officer. ``We
have reaffirmed our intention to become a preferred airline among
frequent travelers around the world.''
   <PERSON>Harris</PERSON> was given the additional role of president, replacing
<PERSON>Mickey Foret</PERSON>, who is leaving the company to pursue other interests,
officials said.
   Also leaving the carrier will be <PERSON>Neal Neehan</PERSON>, senior vice
president-customer services; <PERSON>Clark Omstad</PERSON>, senior vice
president-properties and government affairs; <PERSON>Jim Arpey</PERSON>, senior vice
president-aircraft programs; and <PERSON>Elliott Seiden</PERSON>, vice president and
associate general counsel for <ORGANIZATION>Continental Airlines Holdings, Inc</ORGANIZATION>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> named <PERSON>Thomas Kalil</PERSON> senior vice president-customer
service and announced <PERSON>Lewis Jordan</PERSON>, executive vice president and
system general manager, was given the additional responsibility for
managing the company's international division.
   ``These actions position <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> with a lean and efficient
management structure that reflects the realities of operating
during this fuel crisis,'' <PERSON>Harris</PERSON> said.

   WILMINGTON, Del. -- A bankruptcy judge ruled that the
unsecured creditors of Continental Airlines Holdings Inc. can
sue former Chairman Frank Lorenzo and another executive to
recover money they received for selling their shares four
months before the company's bankruptcy-law filing in late
1990.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Helen S. Balick's action wasn't a
ruling on the merits of the case, merely the green light
necessary under bankruptcy court rules to proceed with it.
The action stems from Scandinavian Airlines System's purchase
of Continental shares owned by Mr. Lorenzo and Robert
Snedeker, another director.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The creditors claim the transaction deprived <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>
of an opportunity to sell equity to <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> at a time when the
company needed additional equity. In addition, they claim
that Messrs. <PERSON>Lorenzo</PERSON> and <PERSON>Snedeker</PERSON> knew, or should have known,
that <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> was technically insolvent when it paid them
about <MONEY>$20 million</MONEY> to buy out their employment contracts.
   The creditors are seeking <MONEY>$180 million</MONEY> in compensatory and
punitive damages from the two men and <ORGANIZATION>Jet Capital Corp.</ORGANIZATION>,
through which they held most of their stake. <PERSON>Mr. Lorenzo</PERSON> said
the transactions were "appropriate and in the best interests
of <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>."
   <PERSON>Judge Balick</PERSON> also allowed the creditors to seek recovery
of <MONEY>$124 million</MONEY> from the <ORGANIZATION>federal Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corp</ORGANIZATION>. The agency has said it will oppose the creditors'
motion.

<TEXT>
   <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air Corp</ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON>Frank Lorenzo</PERSON> said
<DATE>Friday</DATE> he was considering a sale of <ORGANIZATION>Continental Airlines</ORGANIZATION> because the
``noise'' at strike-torn <ORGANIZATION>Eastern Airlines</ORGANIZATION> was hurting the sister
carrier's business.
   In an interview with <ORGANIZATION>The Associated Press</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Lorenzo</PERSON> said the sale
of part or all of Houston-based <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> was under discussion
partly because of the negative impact from <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION>'s bitter strike
and bankruptcy proceeding.
   ``We have to be responsible to our shareholders,'' <PERSON>Lorenzo</PERSON> said
in his <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> office. ``We have an obligation to look for
alternatives ... (<ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>) has been impacted by the noise level
from all of our friends over in <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>.''
   He made the surprise announcement about <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> late <DATE>Thursday</DATE>
in response to a question at a company meeting.
   Miami-based <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> has been under Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection since <DATE>March 9</DATE>, five days after pilots, Machinists and
flight attendants walked off the job. Eastern has been reorganizing
as a smaller carrier and has hired non-union workers.
   The spillover from the <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> situation has eroded bookings on
<ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> flights and cut into its profits in the <DATE>second quarter</DATE>,
said <PERSON>Lorenzo</PERSON>, whose <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION> is the parent of the two carriers.
<ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> showed a net profit of <MONEY>$32.1 million</MONEY> in the <DATE>quarter</DATE>,
compared with a loss of <MONEY>$150.9 million</MONEY> a year earlier.
   <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> could benefit from ``distance'' from <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Lorenzo</PERSON>
said. He cited the success of the <ORGANIZATION>Trump Shuttle</ORGANIZATION>, which enjoyed a
sharp rise in passenger traffic as soon as developer <PERSON>Donald Trump</PERSON>
bought it from <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> in early <DATE>June</DATE> for <MONEY>$365 million</MONEY>.
   Lorenzo stressed, however, a full or partial sale of <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>
are merely being considered as possible options and a final decision
hasn't yet been made.
   ``We have been approached'' by parties interested in a possible
sale, he said.
   Despite the strife at <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>'s reputation as a
fare-cutting carrier with inferior service, <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION> stock has
soared from around <MONEY>$9</MONEY> or <MONEY>$10</MONEY> a share at the beginning of the year to
over <MONEY>$20</MONEY> currently. It rose <MONEY>87{ cents</MONEY> <DATE>Friday</DATE> to close at <MONEY>$20.75</MONEY> on
the <ORGANIZATION>American Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>, after jumping as high as <MONEY>$22.25</MONEY>.
   Possible buyers of <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> or part of it could include
<ORGANIZATION>Scandinavian Airlines System</ORGANIZATION>, which has a <PERCENT>10 percent</PERCENT> interest in
<ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION>Pan Am Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, which has expressed a desire to merge
with another airline. Under <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> law, foreign airlines are allowed
to buy up to <PERCENT>25 percent</PERCENT> of American carriers. There also has been
speculation that <PERSON>Carl Icahn</PERSON>, the owner and chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Trans World
Airlines Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, may be interested in a combination with <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>.
   Lorenzo, however, appears to have rejected the idea of a merger
with another airline, according to a source close to the company who
asked not to be named. That would make more likely a buyout from an
investor group, possibly including <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> or another foreign carrier.
   <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON>Barbara Levites</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Pan Am</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON>Pamela
Hanlon</PERSON>, both in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, declined comment on the matter <DATE>Friday</DATE>. An
<PERSON>Icahn</PERSON> associate didn't immediately return a call seeking comment.
   <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> would carry a sale price of about <MONEY>$2 billion</MONEY> if it
were sold in its entirety, and <LOCATION>Lorenzo</LOCATION> may be trying to find out
what the carrier could fetch, some analysts suggested.
   ``The worst may be over and it surprises me he (Lorenzo) would be
considering a major sale,'' said <PERSON>Daniel Hersh</PERSON>, an analyst with
<PERSON>Bateman Eichler</PERSON>, <PERSON>Hill Richards</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>.
   Lorenzo may be seeking to capitalize on the takeover frenzy
sweeping the airline industry, which could make struggling
<ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> a hot property.
   A group led by <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> investor <PERSON>Alfred Checchi</PERSON> recently
acquired <ORGANIZATION>Northwest Airlines</ORGANIZATION> parent <ORGANIZATION>NWA Inc.</ORGANIZATION> for <MONEY>$4 billion</MONEY>, while
<ORGANIZATION>United Airlines</ORGANIZATION> parent <ORGANIZATION>UAL Corp.</ORGANIZATION> is being ardently pursued by
investor <PERSON>Marvin Davis</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>British Airways PLC</ORGANIZATION> and others.

CONTINENTAL AIR REPORTS LOSS OF $88.3 MILLION 
</P>

<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Continental Airlines Holdings</ORGANIZATION>, which considered bankruptcy two weeks ago, said 
<DATE>Tuesday</DATE> that it lost <MONEY>$88.3 million</MONEY> in the <DATE>third quarter</DATE> on revenue of <MONEY>$1.5 
billion</MONEY>. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>, the Houston-based parent of <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> airlines, 
blamed high fuel costs and soft travel demand for much of the loss. 
<ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>'s results were also hurt by a <MONEY>$17-million</MONEY> severance payment to 
former Chairman <PERSON>Frank Lorenzo</PERSON>, who agreed in <DATE>August</DATE> to sell his <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> 
stock and options to <ORGANIZATION>Scandinavian Airlines Systems</ORGANIZATION> at nearly three times the 
market price. 
</P>
<P>
The airline said its results were hurt by a <MONEY>$15-million</MONEY> expense related to the 
<ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> transaction. 
</P>
<P>
Airline industry analysts said <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> that <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>'s results were in line 
with expectations. Other airlines, including <ORGANIZATION>Delta</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>USAir</ORGANIZATION>, have reported 
large fuel-related <DATE>third-quarter</DATE> losses. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Hollis Harris</PERSON> said in a statement that fuel costs 
"exacerbated our losses." He said fuel had surpassed wages as the airline's 
greatest expense, and that <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>'s fuel bill in <DATE>October</DATE> was <MONEY>$70 million</MONEY> 
higher than in normal times. Jet fuel prices have risen dramatically since 
<LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION>'s <DATE>Aug. 2</DATE> invasion of <LOCATION>Kuwait</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>'s difficult financial situation caused it to consider, but reject, 
a bankruptcy filing <DATE>two weeks ago</DATE>. The company instead said it would sell 
assets to raise money and look for help from a possible investor. 
</P>
<P>
On <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, however, the airline said it was taking its valuable Honolulu-Tokyo 
route off the market. The airline had said earlier that it might sell its <ORGANIZATION>Air 
Micronesia</ORGANIZATION> unit, which holds the governmental authority to fly from <LOCATION>Honolulu</LOCATION> to 
<LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>'s <DATE>third-quarter</DATE> loss doesn't include results of its <ORGANIZATION>Eastern 
Airlines</ORGANIZATION> subsidiary. Eastern, which is in bankruptcy proceedings, has been run 
by a court-appointed trustee since <DATE>April 10</DATE>. <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> lost <MONEY>$158 million</MONEY> on 
revenue of <MONEY>$1.7 billion</MONEY> in the <DATE>third quarter of 1989</DATE>, a period when <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> 
posted huge losses. 
</P>
<P>
For the <DATE>first nine months of 1990</DATE>, the company lost <MONEY>$97 million</MONEY> on revenue of 
<MONEY>$4.9 billion</MONEY>. That compares to a loss of <MONEY>$522.8 million</MONEY> on revenue of <MONEY>$5 
billion</MONEY> in the <DATE>first nine months of 1989</DATE>. <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> released the earnings 
statement after the markets closed. The company's stock closed up <MONEY>12 1/2 cents</MONEY> 
at <MONEY>$2.75</MONEY> a share on the <ORGANIZATION>American Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.

<TEXT>
   <ORGANIZATION>Continental Airlines</ORGANIZATION>' board of directors briefly
considered filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, but decided instead to
seek other ways to return to financial health, a spokesman said
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
   Unidentified sources quoted in <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>'s editions of The New
York Times and The Wall Street Journal said a team of lawyers
worked through the <DATE>weekend</DATE> to prepare Chapter 11 papers to be filed
in <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Bankruptcy Court</ORGANIZATION> after a board meeting on <DATE>Monday</DATE>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> responded to the reports by issuing a statement
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE> saying it had no plans to file for protection from
creditors.
   ``We have streamlined our management, and like the rest of the
industry, are considering other prudent business steps to assist
during the fuel crisis,'' the airline said. ``However, Chapter 11
is not one of the means we intend to take.''
   Later <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, spokesman <PERSON>Ned Walker</PERSON> said, ``The board examined
several different options, one of which was Chapter 11. But it was
rejected in a unanimous vote by the board.
   ``Chapter 11 just doesn't make sense for us. We have a lot of
alternatives,'' <PERSON>Walker</PERSON> said.
   They include possible asset sales, introduction of outside
investors and cost controls, such as the postponement of a
multimillion-dollar image campaign, he said.
   <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> stock dropped 1| to <MONEY>$4</MONEY> per share <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> on the
<ORGANIZATION>American Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION>Standard &amp; Poor's Corp.</ORGANIZATION> said it
had downgraded its ratings on debt of <ORGANIZATION>Continental Airlines Holdings
Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Continental Airlines</ORGANIZATION>, because of problems brought on by
higher fuel costs and sluggish demand for air travel.
   The airline decided last week to remove 17 aircraft that were no
longer fuel efficient from service on <DATE>Dec. 1</DATE> and replace them with
more efficient models. <PERSON>Walker</PERSON> said jet fuel costs have risen <PERCENT>125
percent</PERCENT> since <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION> invaded <LOCATION>Kuwait</LOCATION> <DATE>Aug. 2</DATE>.
   A <MONEY>$1.2 billion</MONEY> order for 25 <ORGANIZATION>Boeing</ORGANIZATION> 757s will still go through,
he added.
   ``We're in discussions with some parties that are seriously
interested in investing'' in <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Walker</PERSON> said.
   <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>'s core operations ``remain strong,'' he said.
   ``Speculation that efforts to contain costs might include a
major downsizing of the airline is just that - speculation,'' the
airline's statement said.
   The reports that <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> had considered bankruptcy surfaced
a day after the carrier realigned its senior management team by
cutting five top executives in an effort to trim costs.
   For the <DATE>first half of the year</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>, which until <DATE>June</DATE>
was known as <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, lost <MONEY>$8.7 million</MONEY>, compared with a
loss of <MONEY>$365 million</MONEY> in the period a year ago. In <DATE>June</DATE> the
carrier's liabilities totaled <MONEY>$1.6 billion</MONEY>.
   Third-quarter results, which have not yet been reported, are
expected to show that <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> suffered losses during the
normally busy <DATE>summer</DATE> travel season and has been hurt by higher fuel
prices since the invasion of <LOCATION>Kuwait</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Frank Lorenzo</PERSON>, who recently stepped down as chairman of
<ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> but remains on the board, reportedly opposes a Chapter
11 filing by the airline, as does <PERSON>Jan Carlzon</PERSON>, chairman of
<ORGANIZATION>Scandinavian Airlines System</ORGANIZATION>, which owns <PERCENT>16.8 percent</PERCENT> of
<ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> stock. A bankruptcy petition filing would reduce the
value of <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION>'s holdings.

FT  11 MAY 91 / International Company News: Continental brushes up its image
 -The airline's moves towards regaining financial health
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A jet in the new <ORGANIZATION>Continental Airlines</ORGANIZATION> white, blue and gold livery was parked
in the humid sunshine at one of the gates of <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION>'s new international
airport terminal last week.
It was one of the first 12 airliners to be repainted in the Houston-based
carrier's new colours.
Over the next three years, the entire fleet of 350 aircraft will be
repainted and refurbished as part of <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>'s efforts to renew its
image and return to financial health.
'We know we are not out of the woods yet, ' said <PERSON>Mr Hollis Harris</PERSON>, the
former <ORGANIZATION>Delta Airlines</ORGANIZATION> president who replaced <PERSON>Mr Frank Lorenzo</PERSON> as chairman of
<ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> last <DATE>September</DATE>.
'It's not going to be easy, but I believe this country needs four or five
major carriers in the market place. I believe we will be one of those,' he
told journalists flown in from around the world to see <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>'s new
corporate identity.
Since <DATE>December</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> has been operating under Chapter 11 of the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>
bankruptcy code.
It sought protection from its creditors to enable it to restructure its
heavily indebted balance sheet. It is now in the midst of a complex
financial restructuring exercise.
<PERSON>Mr Harris</PERSON> hopes it will enable the airline, the fifth largest carrier in the
<LOCATION>US</LOCATION>, to fly out of bankruptcy in the next eight to 12 months.
Many <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> airline analysts believe <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> has a reasonable chance of
pulling through, although much will depend on the length and depth of the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>
recession, the speed and vigour of the recovery in air travel and the
success of the company's financial restructuring.
<PERSON>Mr Harris</PERSON> said when he landed at <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> he was impressed by the
airline's route structure, its staff and its overall potential. 'But the
financial situation was worse than I thought', he explained.
His original plan was to avoid filing for Chapter 11. He felt this would be
bad for staff morale since <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> had already been through a Chapter 11
bankruptcy in <DATE>1983</DATE> under <PERSON>Mr Lorenzo</PERSON>.
Instead, he put several <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> assets up for sale and his former
airline, <ORGANIZATION>Delta</ORGANIZATION>, showed interest in buying <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>'s extensive <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION>
operations. But with the economy weakening, rising fuel prices and the
impact of the <LOCATION>Gulf</LOCATION> conflict, <ORGANIZATION>Delta</ORGANIZATION> decided not to go ahead with a
substantial offer for the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> routes.
High fuel prices were also putting pressure on <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>. By <DATE>December</DATE>, <PERSON>Mr
Harris</PERSON> said, the company decided there was no alternative but to file for
Chapter 11.
However, <PERSON>Mr Harris</PERSON> adopted a radically different approach to the company's
previous Chapter 11 filing. Instead of launching a sweeping programme of job
cuts and internal restructurings, he adopted a 'business as usual' strategy.
The airline would continue to operate normally, while restructuring its
balance sheet. 'The plan was first to make the airline profitable and then
work to bring in additional capital to expand the airline,' <PERSON>Mr Harris</PERSON> said.
This month <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> reported a deeper <DATE>first-quarter</DATE> loss of Dollars 195m.
against a profit of Dollars 21m in the <DATE>first quarter of last year</DATE>. But <PERSON>Mr
Harris</PERSON> maintained the company had operated well since the filing, and with
traffic picking up again, he expected the airline to be operating in the
black in <DATE>July</DATE>.
But the financial restructuring poses a considerable challenge. The plan is
to convert about Dollars 2bn of unsecured debt into equity to reduce the
overall debt burden, including Dollars 2.5bn of unsecured debt and Dollars
4.5bn of secured debt. <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> is also restructuring its aircraft
operating and capital leases while painting and refurbishing the fleet.
To strengthen further the company's finances, <PERSON>Mr Harris</PERSON> is seeking to raise
an additional Dollars 600m in fresh equity. A further Dollars 150m will be
raised from the sale to <ORGANIZATION>American Airlines of Continental</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>Seattle</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>
route, and the company expects to sell its <ORGANIZATION>Chelsea</ORGANIZATION> aircraft catering
subsidiary for about Dollars 80m.
It is also planning to sell a 51 per cent stake in its <LOCATION>Air Micronesia</LOCATION>
operations in the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> which is expected to raise Dollars 300m.
a big impact on existing shareholders equity. <PERSON>Mr Harris</PERSON> said all present
shareholders would see their holdings greatly reduced. This would include
<ORGANIZATION>Scandinavian Airlines System</ORGANIZATION> which has a 16.8 per cent stake in the company
and 18.3 per cent of voting rights. But <PERSON>Mr Harris</PERSON> said he expected <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> to
invest additional funds in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> airline.
Apart from Seattle-Tokyo route and the <ORGANIZATION>Air Micronesia</ORGANIZATION> transaction,
<ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> does not intend to make any significant asset sales. Even in the
proposed <LOCATION>Air Micronesia</LOCATION> deal, <PERSON>Mr Harris</PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> would continue to
operate the service.
The airline already has plans to grow in the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> as well as in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>.
It already provides more services to <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> than any other <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> carrier.
While the airline's biggest burden is its heavy debt, one of its biggest
strengths is its low cost base. This is why <PERSON>Mr Harris</PERSON> said he was committed
not to reduce salaries at <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>. 'Our people are the lowest paid in
the industry. Morale is high. That is helping us in bankruptcy', he
explained.
Although <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>, unlike many airlines, does not have a cost problem, it
does have a revenue problem. At the end of the day, the success or failure
of its recovery strategy will depend on its ability to improve the quality
and yields of its revenues.

   <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air Corp</ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON>Frank Lorenzo</PERSON> said he
was considering a sale of <ORGANIZATION>Continental Airlines</ORGANIZATION> because the ``noise''
at strike-torn <ORGANIZATION>Eastern Airlines</ORGANIZATION> was hurting the sister carrier's
business.
   In an interview <DATE>Friday</DATE> with <ORGANIZATION>The Associated Press</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Lorenzo</PERSON> said
the sale of part or all of Houston-based <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> was under
discussion partly because of the negative impact from <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION>'s
bitter strike and bankruptcy proceeding.
   ``We have to be responsible to our shareholders,'' <PERSON>Lorenzo</PERSON> said
in his <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> office. ``We have an obligation to look for
alternatives ... (<ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>) has been impacted by the noise level
from all of our friends over in <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>.''
   He made the surprise announcement about <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> late <DATE>Thursday</DATE>
in response to a question at a company meeting.
   Miami-based <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> has been under Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection since <DATE>March 9</DATE>, five days after pilots, Machinists and
flight attendants walked off the job. Eastern has been reorganizing
as a smaller carrier and has hired non-union workers.
   The spillover from the <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> situation has eroded bookings on
<ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> flights and cut into its profits in the <DATE>second quarter</DATE>,
said <PERSON>Lorenzo</PERSON>, whose <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION> is the parent of the two carriers.
<ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> showed a net profit of <MONEY>$32.1 million</MONEY> in the <DATE>quarter</DATE>,
compared with a loss of <MONEY>$150.9 million</MONEY> a year earlier.
   <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> could benefit from ``distance'' from <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Lorenzo</PERSON>
said. He cited the success of the <ORGANIZATION>Trump Shuttle</ORGANIZATION>, which enjoyed a
sharp rise in passenger traffic as soon as developer <PERSON>Donald Trump</PERSON>
bought it from <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> in early <DATE>June</DATE> for <MONEY>$365 million</MONEY>.
   Lorenzo stressed, however, a full or partial sale of <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>
are merely being considered as possible options and a final decision
hasn't yet been made.
   ``We have been approached'' by parties interested in a possible
sale, he said.
   Despite the strife at <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>'s reputation as a
fare-cutting carrier with inferior service, <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION> stock has
soared from around <MONEY>$9</MONEY> or <MONEY>$10</MONEY> a share at the beginning of the year to
over <MONEY>$20</MONEY> currently. It rose <MONEY>87{ cents</MONEY> <DATE>Friday</DATE> to close at <MONEY>$20.75</MONEY> on
the <ORGANIZATION>American Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>, after jumping as high as <MONEY>$22.25</MONEY>.
   Possible buyers of <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> or part of it could include
<ORGANIZATION>Scandinavian Airlines System</ORGANIZATION>, which has a <PERCENT>10 percent</PERCENT> interest in
<ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION>Pan Am Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, which has expressed a desire to merge
with another airline. Under <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> law, foreign airlines are allowed
to buy up to <PERCENT>25 percent</PERCENT> of American carriers. There also has been
speculation that <PERSON>Carl Icahn</PERSON>, the owner and chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Trans World
Airlines Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, may be interested in a combination with <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>.
   Lorenzo, however, appears to have rejected the idea of a merger
with another airline, according to a source close to the company who
asked not to be named. That would make more likely a buyout from an
investor group, possibly including <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> or another foreign carrier.
   <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON>Barbara Levites</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Pan Am</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON>Pamela
Hanlon</PERSON>, both in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, declined comment on the matter <DATE>Friday</DATE>. An
<PERSON>Icahn</PERSON> associate didn't immediately return a call seeking comment.
   <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> would carry a sale price of about <MONEY>$2 billion</MONEY> if it
were sold in its entirety, and <LOCATION>Lorenzo</LOCATION> may be trying to find out
what the carrier could fetch, some analysts suggested.
   ``The worst may be over and it surprises me he (Lorenzo) would be
considering a major sale,'' said <PERSON>Daniel Hersh</PERSON>, an analyst with
<PERSON>Bateman Eichler</PERSON>, <PERSON>Hill Richards</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>.
   Lorenzo may be seeking to capitalize on the takeover frenzy
sweeping the airline industry, which could make struggling
<ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> a hot property.
   A group led by <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> investor <PERSON>Alfred Checchi</PERSON> recently
acquired <ORGANIZATION>Northwest Airlines</ORGANIZATION> parent <ORGANIZATION>NWA Inc.</ORGANIZATION> for <MONEY>$4 billion</MONEY>, while
<ORGANIZATION>United Airlines</ORGANIZATION> parent <ORGANIZATION>UAL Corp.</ORGANIZATION> is being ardently pursued by
investor <PERSON>Marvin Davis</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>British Airways PLC</ORGANIZATION> and others.

<TEXT>
   <ORGANIZATION>Continental Airlines</ORGANIZATION> officials made misleading
comments about the troubled carrier's plans to seek bankruptcy
protection in an effort to prop up its stock value, according to a
lawsuit filed <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   Former chairman <PERSON>Frank Lorenzo</PERSON> and others artificially inflated
the market price of <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> stock by denying in interviews with
the news media that the nation's fifth-largest airline was
considering filing for bankruptcy protection, according to the
lawsuit filed on behalf of shareholders.
   <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> disputed the allegations.
   ``As far as this airline is concerned, that suit is utterly
without merit,'' spokesman Art <PERSON>Kent</PERSON> said from <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION>. ``In no way
were our shareholders or the public misled by any statements that
were made. At the time those statements were made, we had no intent
to file for protection under Chapter 11.''
   Continental filed for Chapter 11 protection from creditors on
<DATE>Monday</DATE>, saying it was forced into bankruptcy court by soaring fuel
costs and mounting interest payments on its <MONEY>$6.2 billion</MONEY> debt.
   The shareholders lawsuit, a class action filed in <ORGANIZATION>U.S. District
Court</ORGANIZATION>, was brought on behalf of investors who purchased <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>
stock between <DATE>Oct. 24</DATE> and the airline's bankruptcy filing.
   The shareholders said that during this time period, airline
officials publicly denied their intention to seek bankruptcy
protection even though ``such action was continually under
consideration as a solution to <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>'s worsening liquidity
and other financial problems.''
   The lawsuit accuses the airline officials of violating
securities laws and seeks unspecified damages because of losses on
investments.
   According to the lawsuit, <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> stock fell from <MONEY>$3.62</MONEY>{ per
share to <MONEY>$2</MONEY> per share after the bankruptcy filing.
   In addition to <LOCATION>Lorenzo</LOCATION>, the lawsuit names <PERSON>Jan Carlzon</PERSON>, chairman
of <ORGANIZATION>Scandinavian Airlines System</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>'s largest shareholder;
<ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON>Carl R. Pohlad</PERSON>; and <PERSON>Hollis Harris</PERSON>, president
and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
   <ORGANIZATION>Continental Airlines Holdings Inc.</ORGANIZATION> filed for
protection from creditors under federal bankruptcy laws today,
blaming the move on a stunning rise in fuel costs and heavy debts
accrued in the free-spending <DATE>1980s</DATE>.
   It was the first bankruptcy-court refugee in the airline
business since the dramatic leap in fuel prices caused by the
<LOCATION>Persian Gulf</LOCATION> crisis, and underscored the financial beating taken by
all airlines because of a weakening economy, with fewer passengers
flying and booking tickets.
   The move also marked a rapidly deteriorating situation for
<ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>, once the nation's biggest airline operator, which only
a few weeks ago rejected the bankruptcy-court option.
   Based in <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> is best known as the child of
one-time airline entrepreneur <PERSON>Frank Lorenzo</PERSON>, who built it into a
major force in the airline industry through aggressive
price-cutting and debt-financed expansion after a previous stint in
bankruptcy court seven years ago.
   <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> officials said they expected to operate normally
through the holiday season and passengers would notice no
difference in service.
   ``Essentially, we're allowed to treat the traveling public,
travel agents, tour operators, just as if the bankruptcy hadn't
occurred ...,'' said <PERSON>Paul P. Welsh</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> attorney. ``There
will not be anyone stranded.''
   The airline filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the federal
bankruptcy laws in <LOCATION>Wilmington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Del.</LOCATION>, where it is incorporated.
Under Chapter 11, a company gets a reprieve from debts while it
works out a way to pay the bills and tries to re-emerge from court
protection as a healthy business.
   As part of the bankruptcy filing, <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> said it agreed to
sell its prized Seattle-to-Tokyo route to <ORGANIZATION>American Airlines</ORGANIZATION> for
<MONEY>$150 million</MONEY>, pending approval of the court.
   Today's filing marks the second bankruptcy-court stint for
<ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>. In <DATE>1983</DATE>, amid a bitter labor dispute with the
airline's unions, then-chairman <PERSON>Frank Lorenzo</PERSON> plunged the airline
into bankruptcy court, scapped union contracts and hired low-cost
replacements for workers striking at the time.
   The incident eventually led to changes in the law to limit
companies' right to abrogate union contracts by bankruptcy filing.
   In today's statement, <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>, the nation's fifth-largest
airline, said the latest financial woes were brought on by high jet
fuel costs and a high debt load, which have ``created a temporary
cash shortage for the airline.''
   The airline listed total assets of <MONEY>$4.77 billion</MONEY> and liabilities
of <MONEY>$5.85 billion</MONEY>.
   ``<ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> has made these decisions reluctantly,'' <PERSON>Hollis
Harris</PERSON>, chairman, president and chief executive of <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>,
told a news conference in <LOCATION>Wilmington</LOCATION>. ``We couldn't handle the debt
and the cost of fuel at the same time. Fuel is our highest item of
operating costs.''
   <PERSON>Harris</PERSON> said that since <DATE>July</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> was paying <MONEY>$70 milion</MONEY>
per month more in jet fuel because of the recent runup in oil
prices. He said fuel costs made up about a quarter of its operating
costs.
   <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> lost <MONEY>$88.3 million</MONEY> in the <DATE>third quarter</DATE> of this
year, compared with a loss of <MONEY>$158 million</MONEY> in <DATE>1989</DATE>. For the first
nine months, losses totaled <MONEY>$97 million</MONEY>, compared with a <MONEY>$522.8
million</MONEY> loss last year.
   <PERSON>Harris</PERSON> said he forsaw no need for layoffs, pay cuts or
reductions in benefits to the airline's 37,000 employees as a
result of the bankruptcy-court move.
   <PERSON>Raymond E. Neidl</PERSON>, an airline analyst with <ORGANIZATION>Dillon Read &amp; Co.</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, said if <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>'s creditors agree to a reorganization
plan early on, ``they still have chance of survival'' because
``they have a good, solid domestic system and they have a low
operating cost structure.''
   <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>, which was known as <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air Corp.</ORGANIZATION> until this
<DATE>summer</DATE>, is the parent of <ORGANIZATION>Continental Airlines</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Eastern Airlines</ORGANIZATION>.
Eastern filed for bankruptcy protection in <DATE>1989</DATE> and has been run by
a government-appointed trustee since <DATE>April 10</DATE>.
   Continental had been rumored to be considering filing for
Chapter 11 bankruptcy for the past several weeks.
   As recently as late <DATE>October</DATE>, the company said its board of
directors, including <PERSON>Lorenzo</PERSON>, unanimously rejected a proposal to
file, saying it would consider possible asset sales, cost controls
or seek new investors.
   <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> sold a <PERCENT>16.8 percent</PERCENT> stake to <ORGANIZATION>Scandinavian Airline
System</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>August</DATE> and <PERSON>Lorenzo</PERSON> stepped down as chairman, although he
remains on the board.

<TEXT>
SCANDINAVIAN <ORGANIZATION>Airlines Systems</ORGANIZATION> (SAS) has decided not to participate in any of
the bids for <ORGANIZATION>Continental Airlines</ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> air carrier which has been in
bankruptcy since <DATE>late 1990</DATE>.
<ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> has had a co-operation agreement with <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> since <DATE>1988</DATE>, under
which it feeds around 150,000 passengers a year into <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>
network.
This was cemented by a Dollars 106m investment in <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>, since written
off.
The Scandinavian carrier said yesterday that it saw no point in making a
further investment in <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> as the co-operation was now 'firmly
established' and would continue.
<ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> has three members on the <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> board.
The bid deadline for <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> expired on <DATE>Monday</DATE>, with at least three
suitors thought to be still in the running.
<ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> confirmed that <ORGANIZATION>Lufthansa</ORGANIZATION>, the German airline which had
considered making an offer with <PERSON>Mr Marvin Davis</PERSON>, the Californian financier,
was no longer pursuing a deal.
This appeared to leave three contenders: a consortium lead by <PERSON>Mr Charles
Hurwitz</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>Maxxam</ORGANIZATION> group; an offer from <PERSON>Mr Alfredo Brener</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>Houston Air</ORGANIZATION>; and a
proposal from <ORGANIZATION>Air Canada</ORGANIZATION> in conjunction with a Texan investment partnership.
Shortly after bids closed, <ORGANIZATION>Air Canada</ORGANIZATION> confirmed it was still interested in
<ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>, but declined to give more details. The <ORGANIZATION>Maxxam</ORGANIZATION> group also said
it had submitted an offer by the deadline.
Although both the <ORGANIZATION>Air Canada</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Maxxam</ORGANIZATION> consortia confirmed that they had
submitted bids for <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> by <DATE>Monday</DATE>'s deadline, <ORGANIZATION>Houston Air</ORGANIZATION> was less
forthcoming.
'In the interest of the future of <ORGANIZATION>Continental Airlines</ORGANIZATION> and integrity of its
bidding process, <ORGANIZATION>Houston Air</ORGANIZATION> believes it would be inappropriate to make
further comment on the status of its bid for the airline at this time,' it
said.
<ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> has to present the 'best offer' to the bankruptcy court on
<DATE>November 9</DATE>.

<TEXT>
   <PERSON>Frank Lorenzo</PERSON> parlayed his airline holding
company into a leading force in the industry, but along the way
incurred the wrath of organized labor which vilified him as a union
buster.
   The inability of Lorenzo and the unions to make peace with each
other played an indirect but important role in his announcement
<DATE>Thursday</DATE> that he was exiting the airline business after more than
two decades.
   The 50-year-old entrepreneur, who came to symbolize a tumultuous
decade of airline deregulation, said he is selling most of his
stake in <ORGANIZATION>Continental Airlines Holdings Inc.</ORGANIZATION> to <ORGANIZATION>Scandinavian
Airlines System</ORGANIZATION>. The leading foreign carrier has held a small stake
in Houston-based <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> for two years.
   Lorenzo also is resigning as chairman and chief executive, to be
replaced by <ORGANIZATION>Delta Air Lines Inc</ORGANIZATION>. President <PERSON>Hollis L. Harris</PERSON>, a
highly respected manager lured to <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> after a discreet
search that started four months ago.
   The negative publicity that came to haunt <PERSON>Lorenzo</PERSON> and his
company was an important element in his decision to get out,
<PERSON>Lorenzo</PERSON> told reporters at a news briefing in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>.
   ``It's been perfectly obvious to me that I personally have
become a lightning rod for many of the attacks that the company has
taken in the process of making the changes that have been
required,'' <PERSON>Lorenzo</PERSON> said.
   ``This transaction allows me to step aside and allows the
company to have a new management,'' he said. Asked what he would do
now, <PERSON>Lorenzo</PERSON> said, ``Take a little time to catch my breath. I
haven't had much time to do that.''
   The departure of Lorenzo marks the end of an era, but it didn't
end the criticism of him by organized labor.
   ``We can all shout `hallelujah!,''' said <PERSON>E.J. Breen</PERSON>, chairman of
the <ORGANIZATION>Eastern Airlines</ORGANIZATION> pilots strike committee.
   ``Clearly, nobody denies his genius to put deals together. But
as for his ability to operate (airlines), he's a complete
failure,'' <PERSON>Breen</PERSON> said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>, where
<ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> is headquartered. ``The way I'll remember him is as a
tyrant who destroyed lives and walked away with pockets full of
money and not a care in the world for what he has done.''
   Others reacted with a similar mix of satisfaction and
resentment. The <ORGANIZATION>International Association of Machinists</ORGANIZATION>, which has
led the <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> strike from the start, said he was largely
responsible for the problems in his company.
   ``<PERSON>Frank Lorenzo</PERSON> demolished <ORGANIZATION>Eastern Airlines</ORGANIZATION>, wreaked havoc on
thousands of workers' lives and severely devalued <ORGANIZATION>Continental
Airlines</ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON>John Peterpaul</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>IAM</ORGANIZATION> general vice president. ``Our
condolences to whatever industry he stalks next.''
   Lorenzo will get nearly <MONEY>$30 million</MONEY> in severance payments and
sale proceeds. But that is only a fraction of what his airlines
were worth years ago in better times.
   From his plunge into the flying business in the <DATE>1960s</DATE>, the
<ORGANIZATION>Harvard MBA</ORGANIZATION> helped pioneer innovations ranging from cut-rate fares
to the industry's first hostile takeover. Lorenzo built his holding
company into the largest airline company in the country, owning
both <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION>.
   In <DATE>1966</DATE>, he and <ORGANIZATION>Harvard</ORGANIZATION> classmate <PERSON>Robert Carney</PERSON> formed a
financial advisory firm. Two years later, they created <ORGANIZATION>Jet Capital
Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, which bought a controlling interest in <ORGANIZATION>Texas International
Airlines</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1972</DATE>.
   Lorenzo, then 32, was the carrier's youngest president.
   His image as a union buster began when he fought organized labor
at <ORGANIZATION>Continental Airlines</ORGANIZATION> and won.
   In <DATE>1981</DATE>, <PERSON>Lorenzo</PERSON> merged <ORGANIZATION>Texas International</ORGANIZATION> with <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>
after a bitter takeover battle. Two years later, he put
<ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>, then the nation's eighth-largest carrier, under
bankruptcy protection, scrapped labor contracts and hired strike
replacements at lower pay.
   Lorenzo subsequently acquired <ORGANIZATION>New York Air</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>People Express</ORGANIZATION> and
Frontier airlines, which have been merged into <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>.
   He didn't face another labor fight until he acquired <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION>.
The unions waged a bitter strike against the carrier and made
<PERSON>Lorenzo</PERSON> the target of their hatred.
   Lorenzo lost control of <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> altogether in <DATE>April</DATE> when <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
Bankruptcy <PERSON>Judge Burton Lifland</PERSON> placed the airline in the hands of
trustee <PERSON>Martin Shugrue</PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air Corp.</ORGANIZATION> then changed its name to
<ORGANIZATION>Continental Airlines Holdings</ORGANIZATION>.

<ORGANIZATION>Pan Am Corp.</ORGANIZATION> is among those interested in the possibility of buying <ORGANIZATION>Continental 
Airlines</ORGANIZATION> from <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, a source close to <ORGANIZATION>Pan Am</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>Monday</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Frank Lorenzo</PERSON> said at the company's annual meeting last week 
that all or part of Houston-based <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> was on the block. Then it was 
reported over the weekend that Scandinavian Airline System and an unidentified 
partner are preparing a bid for <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
In a later interview, <PERSON>Lorenzo</PERSON> said the fallout from the bankruptcy of <ORGANIZATION>Eastern 
Airlines</ORGANIZATION>, another <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION> subsidiary, had hurt <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>'s business. 
</P>
<P>
Half of <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> is owned jointly by the governments of <LOCATION>Denmark</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Norway</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION>, 
with private investors holding the other half. <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> owns just under <PERCENT>10%</PERCENT> of 
<ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> and has a marketing arrangement with it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Arranged Financing 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Pan Am</ORGANIZATION>, parent of <ORGANIZATION>Pan American World Airways</ORGANIZATION>, has vast overseas operations, 
especially in the transatlantic market, and is known to be hoping to merge with 
an American carrier that has a domestic route system capable of feeding 
passengers to <ORGANIZATION>Pan Am</ORGANIZATION>'s overseas flights. Airline observers maintain that <ORGANIZATION>Pan 
Am</ORGANIZATION>, which has been losing money, cannot survive without such an arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
These observers say <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> seems to fit the bill. This <DATE>summer</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Pan Am</ORGANIZATION> lost 
out in the bidding war for <ORGANIZATION>NWA Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, parent of <ORGANIZATION>Northwest Airlines</ORGANIZATION>, and recently 
was reported to be interested in bidding for <ORGANIZATION>UAL Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, which owns <ORGANIZATION>United 
Airlines</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"<ORGANIZATION>Pan Am</ORGANIZATION> could be considered a potential buyer, a possible suitor, for 
<ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>," the source said. "<ORGANIZATION>Pan Am</ORGANIZATION> has proved that it can pull the 
financing together to swing the deal," the source said. <ORGANIZATION>Pan Am</ORGANIZATION> was understood 
to have arranged at least <MONEY>$3 billion</MONEY> worth of financing to support its bid for 
<ORGANIZATION>NWA</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
At <ORGANIZATION>Pan Am</ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, spokesman <PERSON>Jeffrey Kriendler</PERSON> declined to 
discuss any role that <ORGANIZATION>Pan Am</ORGANIZATION> might have in a purchase of <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
However, it was also learned that <ORGANIZATION>Drexel Burnham Lambert</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>'s 
investment banker, had approached <ORGANIZATION>Pan Am</ORGANIZATION> about three weeks ago to see if would 
have any interest in buying <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Leases Most Planes 
</P>
<P>
For the <ORGANIZATION>Northwest</ORGANIZATION> purchase, <ORGANIZATION>Pan Am</ORGANIZATION> had lined up financing with <ORGANIZATION>Prudential 
Bache</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Airlie Group</ORGANIZATION> investment partnership, the <ORGANIZATION>Lazard Freres</ORGANIZATION> investment 
firm and a consortium of five major banks. 
</P>
<P>
Airline analysts contend, however, that even though <ORGANIZATION>Pan Am</ORGANIZATION> might have obtained 
enough financing for an acquisition of <ORGANIZATION>NWA</ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION>UAL</ORGANIZATION>, it would be much more 
difficult to do so for an attempt to buy <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>. The analysts reason that 
<ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> owns a far smaller proportion of its airliners and other assets 
than the other two carriers do, so <ORGANIZATION>Pan Am</ORGANIZATION> would need considerably more cash to 
finance the acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
According to <ORGANIZATION>Avmark Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, an aviation marketing and management service in 
<LOCATION>Arlington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Va.</LOCATION>, the most recent figures show that <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> owns only about 
<PERCENT>33%</PERCENT> of its 339 planes and leases the remainder. Northwest, on the other hand 
owns all but <PERCENT>12%</PERCENT> of its 306 planes. United owns all but <PERCENT>14%</PERCENT> of its 425 planes. 
</P>
<P>
"When so many planes are leased, the assets against which you can borrow are 
much smaller," said <PERSON>Paul Turk</PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION>Avmark</ORGANIZATION> official. 
</P>

The analysts also maintain that <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION>'s asking price for <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> will 
be too high for <ORGANIZATION>Pan Am</ORGANIZATION>. "Lorenzo does not sell things cheaply," said one 
analyst who insisted on anonymity.

   STOCKHOLM -- Scandinavian Airlines System said its pretax
loss widened sharply last year due to hefty one-time charges,
in particular, a major loss on the sale of its 40% stake in
the Inter-Continental Hotels Group.
   Under a preliminary accord reached Thursday, Japan's
Saison group agreed to reacquire the 40% Inter-Continental
stake it sold SAS for $500 million three years ago. Saison
holds the remaining 60% of the Inter-Continental chain, which
it purchased for $2.3 billion in 1988.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   As payment for its stake, <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> is to receive three of the
<ORGANIZATION>Inter-Continental</ORGANIZATION> chain's hotels -- <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Portman Hotel</ORGANIZATION>,
and the Inter-Continental Hotels in <LOCATION>Dusseldorf</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>, and
<LOCATION>Cologne</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>. All three hotels are profitable and have
positive cash flow, <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> said.
   The companies expect to close the transaction in two
months, after completion of due diligence procedures. <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION>
estimated that it will show a loss of as much as <MONEY>two billion
Swedish kronor</MONEY> (<MONEY>$330.9 million</MONEY>) from the brief
Inter-Continental foray.
   Despite the record <DATE>1991</DATE> loss, Chief Executive Officer <PERSON>Jan
Carlzon</PERSON> predicted <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> will return to the black this year. A
tough cost-cutting program narrowed the airline's operating
loss during last year's second half compared with the first
six months, <PERSON>Mr. Carlzon</PERSON> said. "And after shedding several
loss-making investments such as <ORGANIZATION>Inter-Continental</ORGANIZATION>, we think
we'll make a profit even though there aren't yet any signs of
an end to the airline industry's deep slump," the <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> chief
added.
   The <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> group's pretax loss widened to <MONEY>1.22 billion kronor</MONEY>
last year from a pretax loss of 763 million kronor the
previous year. The <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> group includes the <PERCENT>50%</PERCENT> state-owned
flag carrier of <LOCATION>Denmark</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Norway</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION>, plus non-airline
operations such as hotels, travel and catering services. The
group's second-half loss before tax narrowed to 178 million
kronor, from a pretax loss of <MONEY>1.1 billion kronor</MONEY> in the
year-earlier period and a loss of <MONEY>1.04 billion kronor</MONEY> during
last year's first six months.
   Revenue last year climbed <PERCENT>1.2%</PERCENT> to <MONEY>32.3 billion kronor</MONEY> from
<MONEY>31.88 billion kronor</MONEY> a year earlier, <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> said.
   Full-year operating profit surged to <MONEY>1.38 billion kronor</MONEY>
from 649 million kronor the previous year. But financial
costs more than doubled because of higher interest payments
and negative effects of currency fluctuations.
   In addition, <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION>'s incurred a loss of 819 million kronor
from holdings in affiliates. That amount reflected <DATE>1991</DATE>
losses by an aircraft leasing affiliate and <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION>'s prorata
share of last year's red ink at <ORGANIZATION>InterContinental Hotels</ORGANIZATION>.
   Nonrecurring charges of <MONEY>1.2 billion kronor</MONEY> also included
in last year's accounts covered write-downs of the value of
<ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Inter-Continental Hotel</ORGANIZATION> holding, as well as the
remaining <MONEY>$70 million</MONEY> book value of <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION>'s stake in
<ORGANIZATION>Continental Airlines Holdings Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, parent of <ORGANIZATION>Continental
Airlines</ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>, an important strategic partner of <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION>,
has operated under Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law protection since
<DATE>December 1990</DATE>.

<TEXT>
   <PERSON>Frank Lorenzo</PERSON> is no longer boss at <ORGANIZATION>Continental
Airlines</ORGANIZATION>, but the carrier he shaped is following a road he traveled
in the early <DATE>1980s</DATE> when <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> first sought refuge under
federal bankruptcy laws.
   On <DATE>Monday</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Continental Airlines Holdings Inc.</ORGANIZATION> filed for
protection for a second time, blaming the move on the recent runup
in fuel costs and heavy debts accrued in the <DATE>1980s</DATE>.
   Lorenzo, the 50-year-old entrepreneur who came to symbolize a
tumultuous decade of airline deregulation, announced in <DATE>August</DATE> he
was selling off most of his stake in <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> to <ORGANIZATION>Scandinavian
Airlines System</ORGANIZATION>.
   He also resigned as chairman and chief executive at <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>,
replaced by <PERSON>Hollis Harris</PERSON>, a respected manager lured from rival
<ORGANIZATION>Delta Air Lines Inc</ORGANIZATION>.
   Just <DATE>two weeks ago</DATE>, in his first public remarks since departing
<ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Lorenzo</PERSON> warned that the troubles in the airline
industry could leave just three or four major airlines within three
years.
   ``And if you don't like air fares today ... just hold on to your
hats - you may not have seen anything yet in terms of air fare
price increases,'' he said.
   The predecessor to <ORGANIZATION>Continental Holdings</ORGANIZATION> was <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air Corp.</ORGANIZATION>,
which Lorenzo built into the nation's largest airline operator,
parenting <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Eastern Airlines</ORGANIZATION>. The growth of <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION>
began in <DATE>1966</DATE> when <LOCATION>Lorenzo</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Harvard University</ORGANIZATION> classmate <PERSON>Robert
Carney</PERSON> formed a financial advisory firm.
   Even before that, in <DATE>1963</DATE>, <LOCATION>Lorenzo</LOCATION>'s first professional job was
in the industry, when he was hired by <ORGANIZATION>Trans World Airlines</ORGANIZATION> as a
financial analyst. Within two years, he was manager of the
financial analysis department at <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION>.
   In <DATE>1968</DATE>, the Lorenzo-Carney duo created <ORGANIZATION>Jet Capital Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, which
bought a controlling interest in <ORGANIZATION>Texas International Airlines</ORGANIZATION> in
<DATE>1972</DATE>. Lorenzo, then 32, a <ORGANIZATION>Harvard MBA</ORGANIZATION> and son of Spanish immigrants
from <LOCATION>Queens</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>, was the carrier's youngest president.
   In <DATE>1981</DATE>, <PERSON>Lorenzo</PERSON> merged <ORGANIZATION>Texas International</ORGANIZATION> with <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>
after a bitter takeover battle. His image as a union buster began
when he fought organized labor at <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> and won.
   The image grew in <DATE>1983</DATE> when he put <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>, then the
nation's eighth-largest airline, under bankruptcy protection,
scrapped labor contracts and hired strike replacements at lower
pay.
   Lorenzo subsequently acquired <ORGANIZATION>New York Air</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>People Express</ORGANIZATION> and
<ORGANIZATION>Frontier</ORGANIZATION> airlines, which were merged into <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>.
   He didn't face another labor fight until he acquired <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> in
<DATE>1986</DATE>, where his relationship with unions was acrimonious and a
strike against the airline made him the target of union members'
hatred.
   Using <MONEY>billions of dollars</MONEY> in borrowed money and cheap fares,
<ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION>, once high-cost airlines, helped <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION>
become the nation's largest airline operator, capturing about <PERCENT>20
percent</PERCENT> of the domestic market.
   But with bitter resistance from the unions, particularly at
<ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION>, both airlines came under extreme financial pressure and
there were doubts about <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION>'s ability to survive.
   After the strike hamstrung <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1989</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> sought
bankruptcy court protection and is still operating under the
supervision of a court trustee who replaced <LOCATION>Lorenzo</LOCATION> in <DATE>April</DATE>.
   It was then that <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> began a quiet hunt for a new
leader, a search that resulted in the hiring of <PERSON>Harris</PERSON>.
   ``It's been perfectly obvious to me that I personally have
become a lightning rod for many of the attacks that the company has
taken,'' <PERSON>Lorenzo</PERSON> said in announcing his departure.

<P>
Talk about good luck. A year ago, people at <ORGANIZATION>United Airlines</ORGANIZATION> were getting ready 
to slash their wrists because the <MONEY>$6.8-billion</MONEY> leveraged buyout of the company 
had fallen apart. Today, they ought to be sending thank-you notes to the 
Japanese bankers whose last-minute reluctance to lend blew the deal out of the 
sky. 
</P>
<P>
Because, you see, if the <MONEY>$300-a-share</MONEY> LBO had gone through, <ORGANIZATION>United</ORGANIZATION> would now be 
choking on a combination of high interest payments and Saddam Hussein-inspired 
fuel bills, the way that debt-ridden airlines such as <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Pan Am</ORGANIZATION>, 
<ORGANIZATION>USAir</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Northwest</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>TWA</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Midway</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Hawaiian Airlines</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>America West</LOCATION> are 
doing. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, <ORGANIZATION>United</ORGANIZATION>, like the country's two other major, relatively debt-free 
airlines -- American and <ORGANIZATION>Delta</ORGANIZATION> -- can stand the strain of higher fuel bills 
because its balance sheet is relatively debt-free. In fact, <ORGANIZATION>United</ORGANIZATION> has just 
ordered new airplanes and is in a dogfight with American for the right to buy 
choice European routes from debt-ridden <ORGANIZATION>Pan Am</ORGANIZATION>, which is once again selling 
prime assets in an attempt to keep itself afloat. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that <ORGANIZATION>United</ORGANIZATION> was lucky rather than smart is beside the point. If you 
compare the <ORGANIZATION>United</ORGANIZATION> that is to the United that would have been, you begin to see 
why, from the dawn of airline companies until junk bonds came briefly to rule 
the earth, loan officers were taught to be very careful about lending money to 
airlines. 
</P>
<P>
The reason, when you think about it, is obvious. Airlines can be very 
lucrative, but they're also very risky. There are expensive planes to buy, 
unpredictable fuel costs to meet, fickle customers to lure. As Chairman <PERSON>Herbert 
Kelleher</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Southwest Airlines</ORGANIZATION> said in an issue of Forbes magazine earlier this 
year, "You (can) go from spilling cash to bleeding red ink like the <LOCATION>Mississippi 
River</LOCATION> going through the <ORGANIZATION>Delta</ORGANIZATION>." 
</P>
<P>
Risks such as those are known as "operating leverage." Any time a company with 
operating leverage borrows a lot of money, it's piling financial leverage onto 
operating leverage. This doesn't merely add risk to risk; it multiplies them. 
It's the financial equivalent of mixing drinking and driving. 
</P>
<P>
But because shrewd and lucky financial operators such as <PERSON>Frank Lorenzo</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Texas 
Air Corp.</ORGANIZATION> (now <ORGANIZATION>Continental Airlines Holdings</ORGANIZATION>) seemed to be the wave of the 
future, the old rule about not combining operating risk with financial risk 
went out the window. 
</P>
<P>
Any airline that wasn't loaded with debt was accused of not having done the 
right thing by its shareholders. Analysts snickered at <ORGANIZATION>Delta</ORGANIZATION> for not being 
daring enough. <PERSON>Marvin Davis</PERSON>, the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> billionaire, raided <ORGANIZATION>United</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>Donald 
J. Trump</PERSON>, then a real estate mogul, now a deadbeat, was threatening to raid 
American. 
</P>
<P>
Who's laughing now? <ORGANIZATION>Northwest Airlines</ORGANIZATION>, which went private in a leveraged 
buyout that Chairman <PERSON>Alfred A. Checchi</PERSON> boasts is two years ahead of schedule in 
repaying its debt, is talking about "major layoffs." Hawaiian, another LBO, is 
on the brink of financial failure. <ORGANIZATION>TWA</ORGANIZATION>, hocked to the eyeballs by <PERSON>Carl C. Icahn</PERSON> 
to buy out its shareholders and make huge payments to him, is choking. <ORGANIZATION>Braniff</ORGANIZATION> 
has gone broke for the second time. <ORGANIZATION>USAir</ORGANIZATION>, which borrowed heavily to buy other 
companies, is being squeezed, as are Midway and <LOCATION>America West</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"We have proven that airlines are not candidates for LBOs," <ORGANIZATION>Pan Am</ORGANIZATION> Chairman 
<PERSON>Thomas G. Plaskett</PERSON> told a group of travel agents earlier this month. "They 
generate enough operating and financial leverage on their own, let alone adding 
to the leverage to provide payouts to shareholders." Indeed. 
</P>
<P>
Then there's our old friend <ORGANIZATION>Continental Airlines Holdings</ORGANIZATION>, formerly <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION>. 
The news leaked last week that <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> had considered going Chapter 11 but 
decided not to do so. The disclosure that the company had thought of going 
Chapter 11 may well end up forcing it into Chapter 11 because suppliers will 
probably cut back on credit and travel agents may stop booking <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> 
flights. They remember getting burned in <DATE>1983</DATE>, when <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION> put <ORGANIZATION>Continental 
Airlines</ORGANIZATION> into bankruptcy, and again in <DATE>1989</DATE>, when it was <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION>'s turn to go 
belly up. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>, which had <MONEY>$2.6 billion</MONEY> in debt and long-term leases on its books 
as of <DATE>June 30</DATE> -- not counting <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION>'s multibillion-dollar debt -- said it is 
thinking of selling its foreign routes to help buy its way out of trouble. The 
problem is that <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> has pledged its foreign routes to the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Pension 
Benefit Guaranty Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, the federal agency that insures pensions. The agency 
got <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> to pledge those assets to guarantee payment of the shortfall in 
<ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION>'s pension plan, a gap that the agency puts at <MONEY>$565 million</MONEY>. <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> 
is still on the hook for <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION>'s pension plan, even though a bankruptcy judge 
took control of <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> away from <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> six months ago. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>'s press relations people, as usual, wouldn't take my call. I didn't 
even bother trying to find Lorenzo, whom I've called for more than 10 years but 
who has never called me back. 
</P>
<P>
But the Chapter 11 prospect makes <PERSON>Lorenzo</PERSON>'s departure from <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> this 
<DATE>August</DATE> look more than a little suspicious. Lorenzo, you recall, bailed out with 
<MONEY>$27 million</MONEY>, thanks to a deal he cut with <ORGANIZATION>Scandinavian Airline Systems</ORGANIZATION> to sell 
his <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> stock and stock options for about triple the market price. 
That's continuing the pattern in which Lorenzo cut special deals with the 
company that put <MONEY>millions of dollars</MONEY> in his pocket at the expense of other 
shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
Poor Frank. He said in <DATE>August</DATE> that he was leaving <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> to let <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> run it 
unhindered. Yeah, right. At least when the Titanic sank, the captain had enough 
class to go down with the ship. 
</P>
<P>
Oops Department: <DATE>Last week</DATE>, in my <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> Celtics column, I wrote that master 
limited partnerships will lose their tax breaks after <DATE>1997</DATE>. I should have said 
"most MLPs," because the post-1997 rule doesn't apply to real estate and 
natural resource MLPs.

<TEXT>
SCANDINAVIAN <ORGANIZATION>Airlines Systems</ORGANIZATION> (SAS) has decided not to participate in any of
the bids for <ORGANIZATION>Continental Airlines</ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> air carrier which has been in
bankruptcy since <DATE>late 1990</DATE>.
<ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> has had a co-operation agreement with <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> since <DATE>1988</DATE>, under
which it feeds around 150,000 passengers a year into <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>
network.
This was cemented by a Dollars 106m investment in <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>, since written
off.
The Scandinavian carrier said yesterday that it saw no point in making a
further investment in <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> as the co-operation was now 'firmly
established' and would continue.
<ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> has three members on the <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> board.
AIR <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> has failed to agree terms for a merger with rival <ORGANIZATION>Canadian
Airlines International</ORGANIZATION>, writes <PERSON>Robert Gibbens</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Montreal</LOCATION>.
The terms of a pre-merger agreement made by <ORGANIZATION>Air Canada</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>PWA</ORGANIZATION>, parent of
Canadian, on <DATE>October 8</DATE> 'contained conditions that cannot be met'. The deal
is 'unachievable', <ORGANIZATION>Air Canada</ORGANIZATION> said.
Under the merger plan, <ORGANIZATION>Air Canada</ORGANIZATION> and Canadian would have continued as
separate entities while a new holding company would have been formed with
shareholders of each group exchanging their stock for new shares in the
holding company.

<HEAD>Scandinavian Airline Makes Deal With U.S. Carrier</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New York news conference scheduled to begin 8 a.m. EDT</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   <ORGANIZATION>Scandinavian Airlines System</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air Corp.</ORGANIZATION> scheduled a
joint <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME> news conference in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> to announce what
<ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> said was a major cooperation deal with a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> airline.
   The news conference comes amid unconfirmed reports in the <LOCATION>United
States</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> that <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> might acquire a stake in <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION>, or
that the two companies would engage in a cooperative business
effort.
   <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION> scheduled an <TIME>8 a.m. EDT</TIME> news conference at <LOCATION>New
York</LOCATION>'s Plaza Hotel to announce the deal. <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Frank
Lorenzo</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON>Jan Carlzon</PERSON> also scheduled a later news
conference at the Plaza.
   <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION>Stockholm</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION> said <DATE>Monday</DATE> the airline had
reached a cooperation deal with a major <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> carrier, but declined
to give details or identify the carrier.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Washington Post</ORGANIZATION> reported in its <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> editions that <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION>
was negotiating to buy a stake in Houston-based <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION>, the
owner of <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> airlines. Citing unidentified
industry sources, the newspaper said <PERSON>Carlzon</PERSON> traveled to <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> in
recent weeks to negotiate with the airline holding company.
   <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>'s <ORGANIZATION>New York Times</ORGANIZATION> indicated <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION> were
expected to announce an agreement to coordinate their schedules to
offer customers the shortest times between major destinations, in
an attempt to attract more business travelers.
   Other reports speculated <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> would buy some of <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION>'s
<LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> or domestic <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> routes, including landing rights in
<LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>, to which <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> long has sought access.
   <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> information director <PERSON>Knut Lovstuhagen</PERSON> refused to confirm
reports on <DATE>Monday</DATE>, but said the deal was ``extensive.''
   The Scandinavian flag carrier, which is <PERCENT>50 percent</PERCENT> owned by the
governments of <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Denmark</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Norway</LOCATION>, has tried to develop a
``global axis'' strategy.
   But negotiations on several other deals fell through last year,
including talks with the Belgian national carrier <ORGANIZATION>SABENA</ORGANIZATION>, with
British Caledonian and with <ORGANIZATION>Aerolinas Argentinas</ORGANIZATION>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION> is the largest <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> airline company, while <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> is the
eighth-largest European airline.

<HEAD>Analysts Believe Continental Can Still Fly Without Lorenzo</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURA TOLLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Now that <PERSON>Frank Lorenzo</PERSON> is leaving <ORGANIZATION>Continental
Airlines</ORGANIZATION>, the question remains whether the carrier can rise above
the problems it accumulated on its way to the top.
   Lorenzo's departure may have stemmed the flow of harsh criticism
from organized labor, but the carrier still faces other obstacles.
   Heavy debts and a bitter strike at sister carrier <ORGANIZATION>Eastern
Airlines</ORGANIZATION> have hurt business, and <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> still suffers from an
image problem. But despite those hurdles, several analysts said
<DATE>Friday</DATE> there is room for optimism.
   ``It is a fairly low-cost provider. With a different kind of
management, it could be a very powerful airline,'' said industry
analyst <PERSON>Andrew Geller</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>PNC Financial Corp.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION>.
   ``I think it definitely has a better future now, or a heightened
chance of a better future with this happening,'' <PERSON>Geller</PERSON> said.
``Whether I think it's a survivor, I don't know yet.''
   <ORGANIZATION>Continental Airlines Holdings Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, formerly known as <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air
Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, announced <DATE>Thursday</DATE> that <PERSON>Lorenzo</PERSON> was selling most of his
stake in the company to <ORGANIZATION>Scandinavian Airlines System</ORGANIZATION> and resigning
as chairman and chief executive.
   Lorenzo will be replaced by <ORGANIZATION>Delta Air Lines Inc</ORGANIZATION>. President
<PERSON>Hollis L. Harris</PERSON>.
   The Houston-based company once commanded <PERCENT>20 percent</PERCENT> of the
domestic airline market through its ownership of <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> and
its sister carrier, Miami-based <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>Robert J. Joedicke</PERSON>, of <ORGANIZATION>Lehman Brothers</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, said the
carrier has several advantages and disadvantages as it moves into
the post-Lorenzo era.
   ``Its labor costs are lower than the industry average. Whoever
takes it over is blessed with a low-cost airline,'' he said. ``They
can be quite competitive among the major carriers.''
   The company's debt, however, ``sort of counterbalances that,''
<PERSON>Joedicke</PERSON> said. Its success, he said, depends on whether management
can realign the structure of its debt, which totaled some <MONEY>$4.8
billion</MONEY> as of <DATE>March 31</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Joedicke</PERSON> also said he believes <PERSON>Harris</PERSON> will make strides in
improving service, which should help attract additional business
travelers.
   ``They kind of had a reputation of bad service that they were
slowly getting rid of, this may hasten that,'' said <PERSON>Thomas Canning</PERSON>
of <ORGANIZATION>Standard &amp; Poor</ORGANIZATION>'s in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>.
   Canning said <PERSON>Harris</PERSON> is well respected in the airline industry
and should be instrumental in polishing <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>'s tarnished
image.
   But <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> also faces problems common throughout the
airline industry, including high fuel costs, sagging traffic growth
and increased competition, he said.
   <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>, he said, needs to attract a loyal following and
obtain a larger share of the flying public. He said that except for
<PERSON>Lorenzo</PERSON>'s surprise departure, he doubted there would be any major
changes immediately.

   <ORGANIZATION>Scandinavian Airlines System</ORGANIZATION> has held informal talks with <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air Corp.</ORGANIZATION> about buying all or part of its <ORGANIZATION>Continental Airlines</ORGANIZATION> unit, <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON>Jan Carlzon</PERSON> said. 

   If <ORGANIZATION>Continental Airlines</ORGANIZATION> "is up for sale," he said, "we will be there to talk and consider the possibilities." 

   Stockholm-based <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION>, <PERCENT>50%</PERCENT>-owned by the governments of <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Norway</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Denmark</LOCATION>, holds a <PERCENT>9.9%</PERCENT> stake in <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION> as part of a marketing arrangement with <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION> announced last fall. 

   Last month, individuals familiar with the situation said <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> and an unidentified partner were in advanced talks with <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION> about the possible sale of <ORGANIZATION>Continental Airlines</ORGANIZATION>. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Carlzon</PERSON> declined to say whether the informal talks have involved a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> partner. 
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> rules prevent foreign companies from having more than a <PERCENT>25%</PERCENT> stake in a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> airline, and so any transaction would have to be structured so that <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> has a minority holding.

   <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air Corp.</ORGANIZATION> says it is considering selling a
minority or controlling stake in its <ORGANIZATION>Continental Airlines</ORGANIZATION> subsidiary
and has talked to parties interested in the airline.
   <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest airline company, also said
<DATE>Thursday</DATE> it has hired an investment adviser to explore a possible
transaction.
   The announcement came a week after a <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> investment firm
disclosed that it holds <PERCENT>12 percent</PERCENT> of <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION>, which also owns
strike-plagued <ORGANIZATION>Eastern Airlines</ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION>Loomis, Sayles &amp; Co.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>
portfolio management company, has said its <PERCENT>12 percent</PERCENT> stake was held
for investment because it believed <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION> would show a profit in
<DATE>1990</DATE>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Scandinavian Airlines System</ORGANIZATION> owns around <PERCENT>10 percent</PERCENT> of <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION>.
   Late <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION> released a statement saying its
chairman, <PERSON>Frank Lorenzo</PERSON>, revealed that the company was considering a
possible sale of an interest in <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> during a management
conference.
   Lorenzo said in a statement there were arguments in favor of
selling <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>, such as giving the airline access to stronger
financial resources.
   However, he said, ``there are also a number of compelling reasons
why a sale of the company may not be advisable.''
   <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> is emerging from a period of consolidations with
other airlines as a stronger company and shows potential for
improved financial results, <PERSON>Lorenzo</PERSON> said.
   <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION> said it retained the investment firm <ORGANIZATION>Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc.</ORGANIZATION> as an adviser on any transaction. <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> spokesman
<PERSON>Ned Walker</PERSON> declined to comment further on the statement.
   Miami-based <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> is in the midst of Chapter 11 bankruptcy
reorganization. The carrier filed for protection from its creditors
on <DATE>March 9</DATE>, five days after its machinists, pilots and flight
attendants went on strike. Since then, it has been rebuilding as a
smaller airline using non-union workers.
   In <DATE>1983</DATE>, <PERSON>Lorenzo</PERSON> followed a similar path with <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>.
   Airline industry analysts expressed surprise at <LOCATION>Lorenzo</LOCATION>'s
announcement.
   ``I expected <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> would be the last thing he would dispose
of,'' said <PERSON>Louis Marckesano</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Janney Montgomery Scott Inc.</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> would carry a sale price of about <MONEY>$2 billion</MONEY> if it
were sold in its entirety, and <LOCATION>Lorenzo</LOCATION> may just be trying to find
out what <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> is worth, he suggested.
   ``He might just be testing the waters,'' <PERSON>Marckesano</PERSON> said.
   Many observers had expected <LOCATION>Lorenzo</LOCATION> to fold the remnants of
<ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> into <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>, he noted.
   ``The worst may be over and it surprises me he would be
considering a major sale,'' said <PERSON>Daniel Hersh</PERSON>, an analyst with
<PERSON>Bateman Eichler</PERSON>, <PERSON>Hill Richards</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>.
   He speculated that Lorenzo might be considering bringing in a
high-profile purchaser to change <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>'s image as a low-fare
carrier that does not appeal to business travelers.
   ``I think the biggest problem is the image of <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> with
the business travelers,'' <PERSON>Hersh</PERSON> said.

   A new <MONEY>$50 million</MONEY> agreement between <ORGANIZATION>Scandinavian
Airlines System</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air Corp.</ORGANIZATION> is designed to strengthen the
competitive positions of both companies, officials say.
   Separately, a report published <DATE>today</DATE> said <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION> is holding
discussions to sell its <LOCATION>East Coast</LOCATION> air shuttle to developer <PERSON>Donald
Trump</PERSON>. According to unidentified sources quoted by The Wall Street
Journal, the pricetag on the three-city shuttle is in the <MONEY>$200
million</MONEY> range.
   As evidence the shuttle is up for sale, Journal sources noted
that planes and lounge areas have been refurbished, and attendants
are getting new uniforms. The service is run by <ORGANIZATION>Eastern Airlines</ORGANIZATION>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION> declined comment on the Journal report, said <PERSON>Mark
Johnson</PERSON>, a spokesman for the airline company. Representatives of
<LOCATION>Trump</LOCATION> weren't immediately available for comment.
   Some say <PERSON>Trump</PERSON> might use the shuttle, which operates between
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>, to help draw people to his hotel
and casino properties in <LOCATION>Atlantic City</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>
   <ORGANIZATION>Trump</ORGANIZATION> already operates a helicopter service between <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Atlantic City</LOCATION>.
   Under <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION>'s agreement with <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION>, the Scandinavian airline
will lease airport gates in the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> area and have the right to
buy up to <PERCENT>10 percent</PERCENT> of <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION>'s stock on the open market.
   The accord, signed <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, also includes provisions for
coordinating marketing, reservations and scheduling, and the
companies will establish a joint training program for airline
workers.
   <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION>, the largest <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> airline company, owns <ORGANIZATION>Continental
Airlines</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Eastern Airlines</ORGANIZATION>, which have been hurt by financial
losses, labor problems and complaints about service.
   SAS, renowned for service but weak in scheduling connections to
the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, has been seeking ways of positioning itself to
exploit the era of European deregulation that will begin in <DATE>1992</DATE>.
   ``Our aim is to maximize efficiency and provide the best
professional service to business travelers anywhere in the world,''
<ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Frank Lorenzo</PERSON> told reporters at a <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> press
briefing.
   Under the agreement, <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> will pay <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> <MONEY>$15 million</MONEY> to
lease three gates at <LOCATION>Newark International Airport</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION>,
beginning next <DATE>spring</DATE>. <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> will pay <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> <MONEY>$10 million</MONEY> for a
similar lease arrangement at <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>John F. Kennedy
International Airport</LOCATION> in <DATE>1991</DATE>.
   <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> also will pay <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION> <MONEY>$25 million</MONEY>.
   <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> will have the right to buy up to <PERCENT>10 percent</PERCENT> of <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION>'s
stock on the open market, and <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> officials said they intended to
make the purchases within six months.
   <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION> stock was the most actively traded issue <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> on
the <ORGANIZATION>American Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>, declining 12<MONEY>{ cents</MONEY> to <MONEY>$14.25</MONEY>. The
company has 39.9 million shares outstanding.
   Jan <PERSON>Carlzon</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> president and chief executive officer, will
become a member of <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors.
   The marriage of a financially pressed <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> airline company and a
service-oriented European carrier makes sense for both, analysts
said.
   <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> will get the access to <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> routes that it is seeking while
<ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION> will get cash that it needs, noted <PERSON>Anthony Hatch</PERSON>, an
analyst for <ORGANIZATION>Argus Research Corp</ORGANIZATION>.
   The agreement is not unprecedented, but it combines elements of
existing arrangements in a new way. <ORGANIZATION>United Airlines</ORGANIZATION>, the biggest
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> carrier, signed an agreement with <ORGANIZATION>British Airways</ORGANIZATION> late last
year setting up a worldwide marketing partnership.
   But unlike the accord between <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION>, the
<ORGANIZATION>United-British Airways</ORGANIZATION> combination doesn't include an equity stake.
<ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION>' equity stake in <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION> ``helps them cement the alliance,''
<PERSON>Hatch</PERSON> said.
   As European deregulation approaches, similar accords between
major airlines in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> are likely to crop
up, said <PERSON>Andrew Geller</PERSON>, an airline analyst for <ORGANIZATION>Provident National
Bank</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION>.
   In another case, <ORGANIZATION>Ansett Transport Industries Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, an Australian
conglomerate owned 50-50 by media tycoon <ORGANIZATION>Rupert Murdoch</ORGANIZATION> and
transportation company <ORGANIZATION>TNT Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, has a <PERCENT>20 percent</PERCENT> stake in <ORGANIZATION>America
West Airlines</ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION>Tempe</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ariz</LOCATION>. The two do not have a
cooperative agreement.
   Officials of <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION> said they began discussions for
such an alliance about nine months ago, at <LOCATION>Lorenzo</LOCATION>'s initiative.
<ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> has similar arrangements with <ORGANIZATION>Thai International Airways</ORGANIZATION> of
<LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION>, and recently purchased a stake in <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>'s national
carrier.
   <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> currently has services from <LOCATION>Newark International
Airport</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>, and from <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>. SAS, heavily
used by business travelers, flies between <LOCATION>Scandinavia</LOCATION> and four <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
cities: <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Seattle</LOCATION>.
   The Scandinavian flag carrier, <PERCENT>50 percent</PERCENT> owned by the
governments of <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Denmark</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Norway</LOCATION>, has tried to develop
what its management calls a ``global axis'' strategy to provide
travelers with the most convenient connections through a network of
cooperation pacts with other carriers.

<HEAD>SAS: Not Immediately Interested in Buying Continental</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scandinavian <ORGANIZATION>Airline Systems</ORGANIZATION> said
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE> it has no immediate interest in buying all or part of the
<ORGANIZATION>Texas Air Corp.</ORGANIZATION>'s subsidiary <ORGANIZATION>Continental Airlines</ORGANIZATION>.
   SAS Managing Director <PERSON>Jan Carlzon</PERSON> released the statement as an
answer to ``recent speculation around <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> and its cooperation
partner <ORGANIZATION>Continental Airlines</ORGANIZATION>.''
   The Wall Street Journal reported last month that <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> was involved
in advanced talks with <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION>, which had said it may consider
selling a minority or controlling interest in <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>.
   The governments of <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Denmark</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Norway</LOCATION> own half of <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION>,
and the other half is in private or corporate hands.
   ``The cooperation between <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Cointinental</ORGANIZATION> is already a great
success and has given <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> an excellent vantage point to service the
American market,'' <PERSON>Carlzon</PERSON> said.
   ``If <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION> decided to sell <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> of course would
guard its interests,'' he said, adding that <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> was ``so pleased
with the current cooperation that the issue of buying <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>
for the time being is not of immediate interest.''
   <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION>, which has a 9.9 percent stake in <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION>, would not be
able to buy <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> outright since foreign companies are barred
from having more than a <PERCENT>25 percent</PERCENT> share in a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> carrier.
   <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> began work in <DATE>June 1988</DATE> on a joint marketing
agreement.

FT  06 MAR 92 / International Company News: SAS stays in red with SKr1.2bn
deficit

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SCANDINAVIAN <ORGANIZATION>Airlines System</ORGANIZATION> (SAS) yesterday reported a pre-tax loss of
SKr1.2bn (Dollars 198m) for <DATE>1991</DATE>, the second straight year it has suffered a
deficit following its loss of SKr763m in <DATE>1990</DATE>.
The loss reflected extraordinary costs associated with a restructuring
programme as well as a write-off of its involvement in the <ORGANIZATION>Inter-Continental</ORGANIZATION>
hotel chain. <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> made a small operating loss of SKr9m before extraordinary
costs against a profit of SKr38m in <DATE>1990</DATE>.
But <PERSON>Mr Jan Carlzon</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> president, expressed confidence that <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> could
return to profitability this year if it succeeds with its cost-cutting
programme, which includes eliminating 3,500 jobs by this <DATE>summer</DATE>.
The carrier confirmed it had reached a preliminary agreement to sell back
its 40 per cent stake in Inter-Continental to the hotel chain's controlling
shareholder, <ORGANIZATION>Saison Holding</ORGANIZATION>, part of the Japanese retail and leisure group.
<PERSON>Mr Carlzon</PERSON> said the airline has lost between SKr1.5bn and SKr2bn from its
unsuccessful attempt to expand its hotel operations after it purchased the
stake in Inter-Continental from <LOCATION>Saison</LOCATION> in <DATE>1989</DATE> for Dollars 500m.
The hotel venture was part of <PERSON>Mr Carlzon</PERSON>'s strategy during the <DATE>1980s</DATE> to
transform <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> into a complete travel company. But the <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> president decided
last year to concentrate on airline operations as passenger traffic dropped
in response to the Gulf War and the recession.
However, <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> will acquire principal ownership of three European hotels from
<ORGANIZATION>Inter-Continental</ORGANIZATION>, including the <PERSON>Portman</PERSON> in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Dusseldorf
Inter-Continental</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Cologne Inter-Continental</ORGANIZATION>, which will be added to
<ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION>'s own hotel chain.
The write-off of its shares in Inter-Continental as well as the bankrupt <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>
carrier <ORGANIZATION>Continental Airlines</ORGANIZATION> amounted to SKr1.2bn, which helped increase
one-time restructuring and extraordinary expenses for <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> to SKr1.9bn.

<BYLINE>Lorenzo Says He's Not Quitting Business</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air Corp</ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON>Frank Lorenzo</PERSON> insists
that he plans to remain in the airline business, countering
speculation that he might quit.
   A defiant <PERSON>Lorenzo</PERSON> also said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> that <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Eastern
Airlines</ORGANIZATION> subsidiary will start turning a profit next year, despite
the strikebound carrier's enormous debts and bankruptcy proceeding.
   While about 100 <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> strikers chanted anti-Lorenzo slogans
outside the long-delayed <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION> annual meeting, the chairman of
the nation's biggest airline company told shareholders he has no
plans to quit the business, won't sell <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> and likely will have
<ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION> assume some of <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION>'s financial obligations.
   ``I have no intentions of leaving the airline business,'' <PERSON>Lorenzo</PERSON>
said at a news conference after the meeting. ``I plan to be around
for plenty of years to come, God willing.''
   Speculation that <PERSON>Lorenzo</PERSON> might quit was fueled by his surprise
announcement <DATE>Aug. 24</DATE> that he was considering selling all or part of
Houston-based <ORGANIZATION>Continental Airlines</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION>'s other main
subsidiary. He had no comment on a statement <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> by <PERSON>Jan
Carlzon</PERSON>, managing director of <ORGANIZATION>Scandinavian Airlines System</ORGANIZATION>, that <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION>
has no ``immediate interest'' in buying part of <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>.
   <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION>, which owns a 9.9 percent stake in <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION>, has been in
talks with <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION> officials about possibly buying part of
<ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>. Under <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> law, foreign airlines are allowed to own up
to <PERCENT>25 percent</PERCENT> of an American carrier.
   Security was tight at the hotel where the shareholders meeting
took place, largely because of <LOCATION>Lorenzo</LOCATION>'s unpopularity among <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION>
strikers. Stockholders had to pass through metal detectors,
television cameras were banned from the meeting room and <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION>
uniformed and plainclothes police as well as private security guards
were present.
   Lorenzo's remarks about Miami-based <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> came as the airline
is mired in the seventh month of a strike that has become a national
symbol of labor resistance and has left thousands of pilots, flight
attendants and <ORGANIZATION>Machinists</ORGANIZATION> union members walking picket lines
demanding <PERSON>Lorenzo</PERSON>'s resignation.
   Eastern has been replacing the strikers with picket-line crossers
and non-union hires and is flying a limited operation, but it is
doing business under the protection of federal bankruptcy court _
where it sought protection from creditors five days after the strike
began <DATE>March 4</DATE>.
   If <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> were sold, some observers believe <PERSON>Lorenzo</PERSON> might
liquidate <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> and quit the business.
   But the airline chief told about 300 shareholders at the meeting
that <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> ``is projecting profitable operations beginning next
year.'' The stockholders responded with applause.
   Eastern has made an ``astonishing rebound from the devastation
caused by the strike of its three unions, and is recovering much
faster than expected,'' <PERSON>Lorenzo</PERSON> said during the hourlong meeting.
   He said <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION>'s proposed reorganization plan, submitted to
bankruptcy court <DATE>July 21</DATE>, likely will receive final court approval
by year end or early next year, clearing the way for the airline to
emerge from bankruptcy at about two-thirds its pre-strike size.
   ``<ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION> is standing behind <ORGANIZATION>Eastern Airlines</ORGANIZATION>, and the
possibility is excellent that <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION> will assist <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION>,'' said
<PERSON>Lorenzo</PERSON>, who aggressively built the parent company from a small
intrastate carrier into an airline empire.
   The annual meeting coincided with a hearing in <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Bankruptcy
Court in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> at which a judge approved a plan for payment of
<MONEY>$98.3 million</MONEY> <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> owes to employee pension plans. <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION> is
lending <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> <MONEY>$45 million</MONEY> toward the payment, <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> is paying
<MONEY>$27 million</MONEY> with the proceeds of asset sales, and the rest has been
deferred until <DATE>July 1990</DATE>.
   Eastern's proposed reorganization calls for repaying all
creditors in full, including refunding the price of tickets that
weren't used because of the walkout.
   The strikers have been pushing for a sale of <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> in its
entirety and have allied themselves in that effort with <PERSON>Joseph
Ritchie</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> businessman. Eastern, meanwhile, has been selling
aircraft, routes and airport gates to raise money toward paying off
its <MONEY>$2.3 billion</MONEY> debt.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Air Line Pilots Association</ORGANIZATION>, which represents pilots at
nearly all the nation's major carriers, has spent <MONEY>$69.5 million</MONEY> _
about <PERCENT>57 percent</PERCENT> of its contingency fund _ on the battle with
<ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION>. Pilots at the other airlines have provided strike benefits
to <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> pilots averaging about <MONEY>$2,400</MONEY> a month per pilot, said
<PERSON>John Mazor</PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION>ALPA</ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>.
   But the number of pilots paying those assessments to their
colleagues at <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> has decreased as the strike has worn on, <PERSON>Mazor</PERSON>
said in a telephone interview.
   ``That's typical for any (strike) assessment, for any labor
union,'' he said. ``It goes through a predictable cycle.''
   <ORGANIZATION>ALPA</ORGANIZATION> members are being balloted on whether to continue strike
benefits to their <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> colleagues, he said.

<TEXT>
   The bankruptcy court filing by <ORGANIZATION>Continental
Airlines</ORGANIZATION> leaves an empire built by ousted chairman <PERSON>Frank Lorenzo</PERSON> in
disarray, but the carrier says it will continue flying while it
tries to reorganize.
   The nation's fifth-largest airline blamed <MONEY>$2.2 billion</MONEY> in debt
and increased jet fuel costs due to the <LOCATION>Persian Gulf</LOCATION> crisis for
<DATE>Monday</DATE>'s decision to seek protection from creditors under Chapter
11 of federal bankruptcy laws.
   <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> said the move did not affect any of about 1,400
flights <DATE>Monday</DATE>. The airline serves 88 <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> cities and 55
international destinations with more than 300 planes. Its main hubs
are in <LOCATION>Newark</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION>, and the airline is
building up a fourth hub in <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION>.
   Management sought to reassure the airline's passengers and
37,000 employees the carrier planned to emerge from bankruptcy
court as an operating entity. The airline would fly its normal
schedule and honor contracts with travel agents and other airlines.
   ``We are confident that there will be no need for layoffs, pay
cuts or reductions in benefits,'' said <PERSON>Hollis Harris</PERSON>, chairman of
<ORGANIZATION>Continental Airlines Holdings Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, the airline's parent, which
also filed for Chapter 11.
   The move, though, leaves in tatters an empire crafted by <PERSON>Lorenzo</PERSON>
from a hodgepodge of carriers including <ORGANIZATION>Eastern Airlines</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>People
Express</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Frontier</ORGANIZATION> and its huge debt is a legacy of its growth
during the <DATE>1980s</DATE>.
   Subsidiary <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> is struggling as it seeks to reorganize after
filing for bankruptcy protection in <DATE>1989</DATE>, <PERSON>Lorenzo</PERSON> was ousted as
chairman earlier this year and his <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air Corp.</ORGANIZATION> was renamed.
   The trip to bankruptcy court was the second in seven years by
<ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>, which filed in <DATE>1983</DATE> amid a bitter labor dispute with
the airline's union. Under Chapter 11, a company gets a reprieve
from debts while it figures out how to pay bills and tries to
reorganize as a healthy business.
   ``This is not a bankruptcy as was <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>'s in <DATE>1983</DATE> or
<ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION>'s last year,'' <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>'s general counsel, <PERSON>Charles T.
Goolsbee</PERSON>, said. ``Remember, those airlines shut down. ... We are
doing none of that. This is absolutely a business-as-usual
program.''
   Some analysts said <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> may have a relatively smooth ride
through bankruptcy court, but recent shakeouts in the industry and
the uncertainty of the <LOCATION>Middle East</LOCATION> situation remain troubling.
   ``It's still a strong airline,'' said <PERSON>Raymond Neidl</PERSON>, an analyst
with <ORGANIZATION>Dillon Read &amp; Co.</ORGANIZATION>, a Wall Street investment firm. ``They've
got good hubs and fairly cheap operating costs. They want to hold
onto most of these assets. In the long term, that could be good.''
   <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> said it had agreed to sell its <LOCATION>Seattle-Tacoma</LOCATION> to
<LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> route to <ORGANIZATION>American Airlines</ORGANIZATION> for <MONEY>$150 million</MONEY>, pending
bankruptcy court approval. The route sale is to be concluded at the
end of <DATE>1991</DATE>, but <MONEY>$140 million</MONEY> of the sale price is expected to be
advanced to <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> before the deal closes.
   As part of the sale, <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> withdrew its other
international routes from the market. Last month, <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> put
those up for sale instead of seeking bankruptcy protection.
   <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> has about <MONEY>$2.2 billion</MONEY> in outstanding debt, about
<MONEY>$1.7 billion</MONEY> of which is secured. It also has nearly <MONEY>$4 billion</MONEY> in
aircraft operating losses.
   <PERSON>Harris</PERSON> said the airline is spending an extra <MONEY>$70 million</MONEY> a month
on jet fuel because of a sharp rise since <ORGANIZATION>Iraq</ORGANIZATION> invaded <LOCATION>Kuwait</LOCATION> in
<DATE>August</DATE>. Prices more than doubled from about <MONEY>57 cents</MONEY> in <DATE>July</DATE> to
<MONEY>$1.28</MONEY> in mid-October before falling back in recent weeks.
   <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> now is paying <MONEY>$1.07</MONEY> per gallon. In addition, the
airline has increased passenger fares <PERCENT>15 percent</PERCENT> in recent months,
but spokesman <PERSON>Ned Walker</PERSON> said the hikes ``come nowhere near to
recovering our fuel costs.''
   <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> lost <MONEY>$88.3 million</MONEY> in the <DATE>third quarter</DATE> of this
year, compared to a loss of <MONEY>$158 million</MONEY> in <DATE>1989</DATE>. For the first
nine months, losses totaled <MONEY>$97 million</MONEY>, compared with <MONEY>$523 million</MONEY>
in the same period a year ago.
   Rising jet fuel costs have affected other airlines, but none had
filed for Chapter 11 before <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>.
   Earlier this <DATE>fall</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Pan Am Corp.</ORGANIZATION> announced it would sell five
prized <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> routes to <ORGANIZATION>UAL Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, the parent of <ORGANIZATION>United</ORGANIZATION>, in a <MONEY>$400

<HL> Texas Air Clears 10% SAS Stake, Discusses Sale of Shuttle to Trump </HL>
<AUTHOR> Bridget O'Brian and Roger Lowenstein (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR>

<TEXT>
   <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, in major restructuring moves, agreed to let <ORGANIZATION>Scandinavian Airlines System</ORGANIZATION> acquire a <PERCENT>10%</PERCENT> equity stake and is holding talks to sell its <LOCATION>East Coast</LOCATION> air shuttle to developer <PERSON>Donald Trump</PERSON>. 

   The investment by <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> and the possible sale of the shuttle have been rumored for weeks. 
But the global scope of <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION>'s joint operating arrangement with <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION>, as well as the interest of <PERSON>Mr. Trump</PERSON> in the shuttle, had been closely guarded secrets. 

   The transaction with <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> establishes a wide-ranging combination of services between the two airlines, including the leasing of gates and landing rights to <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION>Newark</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>, airport from <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Continental Airlines</ORGANIZATION> unit. 

   In addition to the <PERCENT>10%</PERCENT> equity stake -- which <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> will acquire in open-market purchases -- provisions of the agreement include ground service and joint-training arrangements, the payment of as much as <MONEY>$50 million</MONEY> in fees to <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION> and its operating units and new arrangements permitting each airline to feed passengers into the route system of the other. 

   "We should work as vacuum cleaners to get people into the system" said <PERSON>Jan Carlzon</PERSON>, the expansion-minded chairman of <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION>, a consortium of airlines partly owned by the governments of <LOCATION>Norway</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Denmark</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION>. 

   The airlines called the agreement "the airline industry's first comprehensive global alliance among major international carriers." 
<PERSON>Frank Lorenzo</PERSON>, who built Houston-based <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION> into the nation's largest airline company but who has begun shrinking it of late, added in an interview: "From where we stand, this is a sensible marriage. 
It gives tremendous strength and traffic support to <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION>, and the same to <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>." 

   <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION> itself refused to comment on the negotiations to sell the <ORGANIZATION>East Coast</ORGANIZATION> shuttle to <PERSON>Mr. Trump</PERSON>, but sources close to <PERSON>Mr. Trump</PERSON> confirmed the talks were under way. 
Sources say the price under discussion is in the neighborhood of <MONEY>$200 million</MONEY>. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Lorenzo</PERSON> declined to comment on any talks with <PERSON>Mr. Trump</PERSON>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Trump</PERSON> couldn't be reached and his attorney in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> declined to comment. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION>'s lucrative, three-city shuttle service, which is operated by <ORGANIZATION>Eastern Airlines</ORGANIZATION>, has been considered for purchase by, among others, <PERSON>Carl Icahn</PERSON>, the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> investor who control <ORGANIZATION>Trans World Airlines</ORGANIZATION>. 
The extent of <PERSON>Mr. Icahn</PERSON>'s interest couldn't be established. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION>'s willingness to sell the operation has been clear for months. 
In a transaction that eventually was scuttled under legal pressure from hard-nosed unions at <ORGANIZATION>Eastern Airlines</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION> proposed to transfer ownership of the operation from <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> to a newly created unit of <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION> for <MONEY>$225 million</MONEY>. 
At the time, <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION> proposed to sell a <PERCENT>20%</PERCENT> interest in the operation to private investors -- and <PERSON>Mr. Trump</PERSON> is among those who expressed an interest. 

   As further evidence to some inside the company that <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION> is preparing the shuttle to be sold, shuttle planes have been refurbished, airport lounges have been renovated and flight attendants have been measured and outfitted for new uniforms that say simply, "Shuttle." 

   Real estate executives in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> say they have long suspected <PERSON>Mr. Trump</PERSON> of wanting to own an airline -- an asset that would be compatible with his extensive holdings in hotels and casinos. 
And the <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> shuttle has a high visibility in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> -- exactly the sort of asset that <PERSON>Mr. Trump</PERSON> covets. 

   A source close to the talks said <PERSON>Mr. Trump</PERSON>, in the short term, would run the airline as is, and put in enough capital to upgrade service. 
"He thinks that with his name he can clean it up and get it to run on time," the source said. 

   However, another source familiar with <PERSON>Mr. Trump</PERSON> said that "his thought pattern all ties in with <LOCATION>Atlantic City</LOCATION>. 
The city is a fabulous play but the transportation into it is terrible. 
The biggest population centers for getting to <LOCATION>Atlantic City</LOCATION>," he added, are <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>. 
The latter three are served by the <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> shuttle. 

   "They have a fabulous airport right there in <LOCATION>Atlantic City</LOCATION>," the source added, "but as of now they hardly use it." 

   <PERSON>Mr. Trump</PERSON> currently operates a regularly scheduled helicopter service (with four round trips daily) between <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Atlantic City</LOCATION>, mainly for gamblers and prize-fight fans. 
The helicopter service, which has a toll-free reservations number, is known as "Trump Air." 

   Sources said they expect the shuttle negotiations, which have been occurring since <DATE>last month</DATE>, to conclude in the next few weeks. 
However, a source close to the talks said the outcome of negotiations between two such "hard-nosed" figures as <PERSON>Mr. Trump</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mr. Lorenzo</PERSON> couldn't be guaranteed. 
"Can you imagine them negotiating with each other?" the source said. 

   However, <PERSON>Mr. Lorenzo</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mr. Carlzon</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> are an unlikely duo -- with the European airline chieftain making his reputation on high-quality service, harmonious relations with labor unions and strong earnings. 
<PERSON>Mr. Lorenzo</PERSON>, by contrast, has focused on cost-cutting to a degree that has led to phases of poor customer service, strife with unions and severe losses at both <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION>. 

   But the stark difference is precisely what make the combination so compelling. 
For instance, <PERSON>Mr. Lorenzo</PERSON> said, <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION>'s renowned <ORGANIZATION>Quality Training Institute</ORGANIZATION> will train all <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> employees. 
And <PERSON>Mr. Carlzon</PERSON> said he would call on <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION>'s expertise with cost-cutting and competition as <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> prepares to face the deregulation of the European airline industry in three years. 

   "We must increase cost efficiency, we must have an information distribution system to reach the market, we must develop a traffic system and a hub system," <PERSON>Mr. Carlzon</PERSON> said. 
"We have a lot to learn in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> from the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>" 

   Specifically, <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> plans to introduce daily non-stop service from <LOCATION>Oslo</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Norway</LOCATION>, to <LOCATION>Newark</LOCATION> next <DATE>May</DATE> and move a flight that currently lands at <LOCATION>JFK airport</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Newark</LOCATION>. 
It will sublet three gates and passenger service facilities at <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>'s new <LOCATION>Newark</LOCATION> terminal. 
When <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> completes <MONEY>$100 million</MONEY> of proposed renovations at <LOCATION>JFK airport</LOCATION>, the two companies will discuss similar service to <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. 

   The <MONEY>$50 million</MONEY> payment from <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> will be divided among the various <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION> entities, with <MONEY>$25 million</MONEY> going to the parent corporation and <MONEY>$15 million</MONEY> to <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> for access to the <LOCATION>Newark</LOCATION> facility. 
The remaining <MONEY>$10 million</MONEY> will go to <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> for access to <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> facilities at <LOCATION>JFK Airport</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, when those facilities are completed. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Carlzon</PERSON> will become a member of the <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION> board. 
As part of the agreement, <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION> said it wouldn't fight <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> buying a stake in the company, which the European carrier said it would do within six months. 
The parties agreed that the stake wouldn't exceed <PERCENT>10%</PERCENT> -- which is also the maximum interest a foreign carrier can hold in a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> carrier without <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> government approval. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Lorenzo</PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> originally wanted to buy the <PERCENT>10%</PERCENT> stake directly from <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION>, but that he refused. 
"We didn't want to because we think our stock is too inexpensive and <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION> doesn't have that kind of need for cash," he said. 

   In a statement, <PERSON>Mr. Lorenzo</PERSON> added: "Clearly, <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> thinks, as we do, that <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION> shares are undervalued."

   STOCKHOLM -- Scandinavian Airlines System posted a big
pretax loss for 1990 and said that it expects to remain
unprofitable this year because of depressed airline markets
and continued restructuring costs.
   Jan Carlzon, chief executive officer, said that volatile
conditions in the airline industry made it practically
impossible to predict developments more than a few weeks
ahead.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> group, which besides the airline includes hotel
and charter travel units, is <PERCENT>50%</PERCENT>-owned by the governments of
<LOCATION>Denmark</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Norway</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION>. It posted a <DATE>1990</DATE> pretax loss of
<MONEY>763 million Swedish kronor</MONEY> (<MONEY>$127.3 million</MONEY>) compared with
pretax profit of <MONEY>2.2 billion kronor</MONEY> (<MONEY>$367.1 million</MONEY>) a year
earlier. Operating profit last year fell <PERCENT>48%</PERCENT> to 649 million
kronor from <MONEY>1.24 billion kronor</MONEY> in <DATE>1989</DATE>.
   <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> boosted operating profit with 700 million kronor from
the sale of used aircraft and other fixed assets during the
year. However, affiliated companies -- mainly the
<ORGANIZATION>Inter-Continental Hotels Group</ORGANIZATION> plus <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>'s flag carrier Lan
<LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION> -- produced losses of 156 million kronor last year,
compared with <DATE>1989</DATE> profit of 83 million kronor. The remaining
<DATE>1990</DATE> operating profit was wiped out by <MONEY>1.7 billion kronor</MONEY> in
one-time charges.
   The nonrecurring items included writedowns for
shareholdings in affiliated companies -- such as a 500
million kronor decline in the market value of <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERCENT>18.4%</PERCENT>
voting stake in troubled <ORGANIZATION>Continental Airlines Holdings</ORGANIZATION> of the
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Almost half of the one-time charges stemmed from a tough
cost-cutting program that is expected to eliminate 3,500 jobs
-- <PERCENT>17%</PERCENT> of the total payroll -- at the airline division by the
end of <DATE>1992</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Mr. Carlzon</PERSON> acknowledged that <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> almost certainly will
need to raise additional equity to complete the <MONEY>20 billion
kronor</MONEY> of aircraft purchases it plans during the coming
decade. However, the three government holders have frequently
balked at injecting as much equity as management wanted. And
they will be stung by the <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> board's decision to omit a
dividend for <DATE>1990</DATE>.

<LP>
   STOCKHOLM -- Jan Carlzon, the flashy chief executive of
Scandinavian Airlines System, prides himself on being a deft
communicator.
   But Mr. Carlzon has had trouble lately explaining signs of
a retrenchment under way at the half-state-owned airline of
Denmark, Norway and Sweden. While he and other company
officials stubbornly defended their dream of building a
global travel empire, assets acquired amid fanfare in a late
1980s buying binge have been quietly put up for sale.
                                                                                                       

   At a five-hour seminar for Scandinavian journalists here
this week, Mr. Carlzon finally set the record straight-sort
of. "When I described our global travel service company
concept in the past, it may have sounded like everything was
equally important," he explained. "That's not true. What
we're doing is streamlining operations so that everything
complements the airline, which is overwhelmingly the most
important element in the travel service idea."
   To that end, Mr. Carlzon remains bullish on the purchase
of a big minority stake in Continental Airlines Holdings,
parent of U.S. carrier Continental Airlines. SAS credits its
link with Continental's domestic traffic system for an 85%
surge in transit passengers in the past two years -- and an
improvement of 100 million Swedish kronor ($16.3 million) a
year in operating results from North Atlantic traffic.
   The U.S. routes still aren't profitable. "But I'm afraid
to even think where we'd be today had we not bought into
Continental," Mr. Carlzon said.
   However, Mr. Carlzon admitted he now regrets other
acquisitions -- from the 40% stake in Inter-Continental
Hotels group bought for $500 million to a 35% holding in
Chile's flag carrier Lan Chile. "We still want to reach out
to business travelers on the ground as well as in the air.
But we can do that by operating hotels, we realize we don't
need to own them," he added.
   As a result, both the Inter-Continental and Lan Chile
stakes are now on the block, Mr. Carlzon said, though he
insists he'll bide his time until he is offered the right
price. The SAS chief played down recent reports that SAS will
shed the Inter-Continental stake by November. "There have
been discussions but no negotiations with our partner. We
haven't reached any agreement and there isn't any time scale
agreed on yet," he declared.
   "We're also looking for ways to sell the Lan Chile stake.
But since the airline isn't losing money any more it isn't
urgent," Mr. Carlzon said.
   But slashing costs no doubt is the top priority. In
January, the airline unveiled a plan to cut annual costs by
three billion kronor, or roughly 20%, in part by eliminating
3,500 jobs by the end of next year. A majority of unions
representing SAS employees have agreed to negotiate
contracts, but Mr. Carlzon remains bogged down in a bitter
struggle with pilots and flight attendants that some analysts
fear may cause walkouts before a settlement.
   But Mr. Carlzon can't afford to waver yet. Even if air
travel perks up about 1993, as many industry analysts expect,
he warned that SAS will have to keep up pressure on costs to
survive fierce competition in deregulated European skies.
   Other than more draconian staff cuts, the only way to
control costs is through tighter cooperation with Swissair
and Austrian Airlines, partners since late 1989 in what Mr.
Carlzon dubbed the European Quality Alliance. The three
airlines recently agreed to intensify cooperation in
marketing, product development and integrating traffic
systems.
   The objective is to create a common image in markets
around Europe virtually as strong as if the airlines merged.
Yet such a merger, Mr. Carlzon stressed, can't be
contemplated today.
   That's partly a consequence of SAS's tangled ownership
structure; SAS and Swissair still haven't figured out how to
swap stakes of 5% to 10% in each other as outlined under a
September 1989 accord. Moreover, SAS executives worry that a
merger could threaten landing rights each of the three
airlines holds in the U.S. and various parts of Asia.
   Still, cooperation short of marriage could still yield
annual cost savings of up to 500 million kronor a year, Mr.
Carlzon said. And he disclosed that "there's now talk of
British Midland Airways becoming an active partner in the
alliance."
   The addition of British Midland, whose parent, Airlines of
Britain Holdings PLC, is 25%-owned by SAS, would give the
European Quality Alliance a hotly desired London hub. London,
together with Zurich, Vienna and Copenhagen, would comprise
the strongest hub network of any airline grouping in Europe,
Mr. Carlzon boasted.
   A spokesman for British Midland, however, said the carrier
"has announced no plans" to join the alliance and called such
reports "conjecture." Nonetheless, he added, the joint
marketing arrangements that British Midland has with SAS
would no doubt be affected by the Scandinavian carrier's
entrance into a deeper marketing alliance with Austrian and
Swissair.
   In addition, even the wisdom of tightening relations among
Quality Alliance members has met resistance. Founding member
Finnair pulled out of the alliance following the decision,
although it has pledged to maintain bilateral links with
remaining members.
   Finnair Executive Vice President Henrik Arle said the
alliance did not boost passenger traffic or market share for
his carrier, and added that Finnair was uncomfortable with
plans to turn over certain decision-making powers to a
committee. The European Quality Alliance "was not a failure,
but the achievements were not that remarkable," he said.

   HOUSTON -- Continental Airlines Holdings Inc. reported an
unprecedented $2.25 billion fourth-quarter loss, the result
mainly of massive write-offs taken in an attempt to untangle
its complicated finances.
   The company, parent to Continental Airlines, blamed its
own bankruptcy filing, the liquidation of its Eastern
Airlines unit and the troubles besetting the entire airline
industry for the loss, which widened from a $362.8 million
loss in the year-earlier quarter. On a per-share basis, the
loss swelled to $52.37 from $9.17.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The write-downs, which account for more than <PERCENT>80%</PERCENT> of the
latest-quarter loss, reflect efforts by <ORGANIZATION>Continental Holdings</ORGANIZATION>
to put behind it the controversial and debt-laden legacy of
former chairman <PERSON>Frank Lorenzo</PERSON>, who borrowed huge sums to
assemble <ORGANIZATION>Continental Holdings</ORGANIZATION> -- then known as <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air
Corp.</ORGANIZATION> -- from four ailing carriers. <ORGANIZATION>Continental Holdings</ORGANIZATION> and
all its subsidiaries sought Chapter 11 protection in
<DATE>December</DATE>, squeezed for cash by their huge debt load and high
jet fuel prices.
   "Many of these write-offs could have been taken in the
future," said <PERSON>Hollis L. Harris</PERSON>, the airline's chairman and
president. "But reporting all of these expenses now will
allow the company to concentrate its efforts on successfully
emerging from Chapter 11 unencumbered by past events."
   To be sure, <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>'s losses weren't entirely the
result of one-time items. High fuel costs and a slowdown in
air travel combined to create a <DATE>fourth quarter</DATE> operating loss
at the holding company of <MONEY>$333.4 million</MONEY>. That loss was in
the same range as those posted by most airlines for the <DATE>last
quarter</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Mr. Hollis</PERSON> said he expected the nonrecurring, noncash
adjustments -- which totaled about <MONEY>$1.8 billion</MONEY> of the
quarterly loss -- to have no effect on continuing operations.
   <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>'s stock felt the impact, falling <MONEY>25 cents</MONEY> a
share to <MONEY>$3.25</MONEY> in <ORGANIZATION>American Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> trading.
   "Obviously, what they did was, they wiped the table
clean," said <PERSON>Timothy Pettee</PERSON>, a transportation analyst with
<ORGANIZATION>Alliance Capital Management</ORGANIZATION>. "The surviving balance sheet is
probably as ugly as you could get." <PERSON>Mr. Pettee</PERSON> estimates that
<ORGANIZATION>Continental Holdings</ORGANIZATION> currently has a negative book value of
<MONEY>$77</MONEY> a share as a result of the <DATE>fourth-quarter</DATE> results.
   Revenue declined <PERCENT>21%</PERCENT> to <MONEY>$1.38 billion</MONEY> in the <DATE>1990 fourth
quarter</DATE> from <MONEY>$1.73 billion</MONEY> a year earlier.
   For all of <DATE>1990</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> had a net loss of <MONEY>$2.34
billion</MONEY>, or <MONEY>$57.52</MONEY> a share, compared with a <DATE>1989</DATE> loss of
<MONEY>$885.6 million</MONEY> -- then a record -- or <MONEY>$22.71</MONEY> a share. Revenue
fell <PERCENT>6.8%</PERCENT> to <MONEY>$6.23 billion</MONEY> in <DATE>1990</DATE> from <MONEY>$6.68 billion</MONEY> in
<DATE>1989</DATE>.
   The <DATE>1989</DATE> figures include revenue from <ORGANIZATION>Eastern Airlines</ORGANIZATION>, a
unit operated by <ORGANIZATION>Continental Holdings</ORGANIZATION> until a bankruptcy
judge appointed a trustee to run it last <DATE>April</DATE>. Eastern
stopped flying in <DATE>January</DATE>, and <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> said it is writing
down <MONEY>$1.1 billion</MONEY> in connection with <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION>'s liquidation.
   That includes more than <MONEY>$600 million</MONEY> <ORGANIZATION>Continental Holdings</ORGANIZATION>
is obliged to pay regarding <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION>'s pension debt; about
<MONEY>$240 million</MONEY> for guarantees on <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERCENT>11.36%</PERCENT> preferred
stock; and some other, smaller liabilities.
   <ORGANIZATION>Continental Holdings</ORGANIZATION> said it expects to take a deferred
credit relating to its investment in <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION>, but won't do so
until it clears up potential litigation regarding the <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION>
bankruptcy case. The credit could total as much as <MONEY>$1.1
billion</MONEY>, but given <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION>'s liquidation, <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> isn't
likely to receive anything close to that amount.
   <ORGANIZATION>Continental Holdings</ORGANIZATION> also said it was writing down <MONEY>$439.6
million</MONEY>, primarily in "good will" created as a result of its
various mergers and acquisitions in <DATE>1986</DATE> and <DATE>1987</DATE>. That total
also includes various deferred expenses and debt discounts.
   The company also wrote off <MONEY>$270 million</MONEY> for impairment of
assets, most of which reflects the declining value of older,
noisier aircraft that generally will be banned by decade's
end. About <PERCENT>10%</PERCENT> of the <MONEY>$270 million</MONEY> write-down covers
<ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION> terminal and maintenance hangar, which
it will have to give up in <DATE>1993</DATE> when it moves to new quarters
at the <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION> airport currently under construction.
   Even after the one-time charges are accounted for, the
company's chief subsidiary, <ORGANIZATION>Continental Airlines</ORGANIZATION>, had hefty
losses of its own. The airline blamed those losses on jet
fuel expenses, which added <MONEY>$201 million</MONEY> to operating costs in
the third and fourth quarters. As a result, <ORGANIZATION>Continental
Airlines</ORGANIZATION> posted a <DATE>fourth-quarter</DATE> operating loss of <MONEY>$299.6
million</MONEY> on revenue of <MONEY>$1.3 billion</MONEY>. In the <DATE>year-earlier
quarter</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Continental Airlines</ORGANIZATION> had an operating loss of only
<MONEY>$8 million</MONEY> on revenue of <MONEY>$1.2 billion</MONEY>.

   <ORGANIZATION>Scandinavian Airlines System</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Swissair</ORGANIZATION> announced plans to swap stakes of <PERCENT>5%</PERCENT> to <PERCENT>10%</PERCENT> in each other under a broad air-traffic and travel-services alliance. 

   The two carriers said the planned partnership will give them sufficient critical mass to be among five surviving Europe-based intercontinental carriers in a deregulated air industry of the <DATE>1990s</DATE>. 
They said planned coordination of their traffic-systems, marketing and other functions would save about <MONEY>200 million Swedish kronor</MONEY> (<MONEY>$31 million</MONEY>) a year. 
The gains are expected to multiply as cooperation evolves -- with resulting profits shared equally. 

   The plan, which was announced simultaneously in <LOCATION>Zurich</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Switzerland</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Stockholm</LOCATION>, also is intended to include areas such as catering, hotels, fleet planning and product development. 
But most of the details remain to be worked out. 

   SAS Chief Executive Officer <PERSON>Jan Carlzon</PERSON> said that if the <ORGANIZATION>Swissair</ORGANIZATION> alliance develops according to plan, the level of cross-ownership will increase in the future. 
<ORGANIZATION>Swissair</ORGANIZATION> said representation on each other's boards may occur. 
<PERSON>Mr. Carlzon</PERSON> said existing partners such as <ORGANIZATION>Airlines of Britain PLC</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Austrian Airlines</ORGANIZATION> could be included in the coordinated air-traffic scheme. 
In addition, he proposed that <ORGANIZATION>Finnair</ORGANIZATION> join the group. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Carlzon</PERSON> called <ORGANIZATION>Swissair</ORGANIZATION> "an ideal partner" with a similar strategy focused on business travelers and high-quality service. 
He said <ORGANIZATION>Swissair</ORGANIZATION> boasts the extensive long-haul network in <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Middle East</LOCATION>, places where <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> is weak. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Swissair</ORGANIZATION> said the two airlines initially will increase seat capacity on their flights linking <LOCATION>Zurich</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Geneva</LOCATION> with the three Nordic capitals. 
Travelers from <LOCATION>Scandinavia</LOCATION> would then be able to fly to <LOCATION>Switzerland</LOCATION> and connect onto <ORGANIZATION>Swissair</ORGANIZATION> flights to, say, <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> or <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>, while passengers from central <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> could fly to <LOCATION>Copenhagen</LOCATION> to connect to <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> flights to <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>. 
The two airlines could operate joint flights, split up frequencies by time or day or simply harmonize their existing schedules in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Swissair</ORGANIZATION> said. 

   But the <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> chief acknowledged that <ORGANIZATION>Swissair</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>Zurich</LOCATION> hub is less attractive than <LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION> or other European capitals which <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> earlier considered as possible gateways for intercontinental routes. 
A couple of years ago, <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> tried very hard to arrange a merger with <ORGANIZATION>Sabena</ORGANIZATION>. 
Further, since <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Swissair</ORGANIZATION> have different partners in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, the new alliance probably won't have much impact on <LOCATION>North Atlantic</LOCATION> traffic, <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> officials said. 

   SAS last year bought <PERCENT>10%</PERCENT> of <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air Corp.</ORGANIZATION> as a way of cementing a marketing alliance with the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> concern's <ORGANIZATION>Continental Airlines</ORGANIZATION> unit. 
Recently, <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> had been talking to <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> Air about buying more or all of <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>, with <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> partners. 
<ORGANIZATION>Swissair</ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, in <DATE>March</DATE> signed a marketing deal with <ORGANIZATION>Delta Air Lines</ORGANIZATION>. 
Four months later, the two swapped <PERCENT>5%</PERCENT> stakes, <ORGANIZATION>Swissair</ORGANIZATION> paying about <MONEY>$193 million</MONEY> and <ORGANIZATION>Delta</ORGANIZATION> about <MONEY>$77 million</MONEY>. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Swissair</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Armin Baltensweiler</PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION>Delta</ORGANIZATION> tie-up gave his company extra incentive to reach an agreement with <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION>. 
Between <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Delta</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Swissair</ORGANIZATION> is closer to its goal of safeguarding its long-term competitiveness. 

   The agreement, approved by <ORGANIZATION>Swissair</ORGANIZATION>'s board <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> and <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> directors yesterday, calls for an exchange of shares, but the exact size of the respective shareholdings will be the subject of further negotiations. 
So will the composition of the joint executive board that will steer the partnership. 

   <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Swissair</ORGANIZATION> intend to complete the share swap by the <DATE>summer</DATE>. 
But executives admit they haven't agreed on a method of valuation. 
<ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION>'s complex ownership is another potential pitfall. 
<LOCATION>Scandinavia</LOCATION>'s airline is half-owned by the Danish, Norwegian and Swedish governments with the remaining <PERCENT>50%</PERCENT> split among publicly traded holding companies in each of the three Nordic countries. 
<ORGANIZATION>Swissair</ORGANIZATION> is <PERCENT>23%</PERCENT> owned by federal and cantonal authorities. 

   <ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Swissair</ORGANIZATION> also said they intend to integrate their hotels under a global travel-service system. 
<ORGANIZATION>SAS</ORGANIZATION> owns 23 hotels directly and holds interests in 105 more through its <PERCENT>40%</PERCENT> stake in <ORGANIZATION>Intercontinental Hotel Corp.</ORGANIZATION> acquired earlier this year.
