<TEXT>
   An 11-year-old Californian, the youngest pilot to
fly the <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION>, stepped from the cockpit <DATE>Thursday</DATE> with a huge
grin on his freckled face. He was greeted by champagne toasts and a
proud but worried mother.
   ``We're finally here. We made it,'' said <PERSON>Christopher Lee
Marshall</PERSON>, weary but beaming, as he stood on the wing of his
single-engine <PERSON>Mooney</PERSON> 252 aircraft at <LOCATION>Le Bourget</LOCATION>, the same airfield
where <PERSON>Charles Lindbergh</PERSON> completed the first solo transatlantic
flight in <DATE>1927</DATE>.
   ``Mommy missed you so much. Give me a kiss,'' said his mother,
<PERSON>Gail Marshall</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Oceana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, who waved an American flag and
handed Christopher a new stuffed bear.
   His old stuffed bear <PERSON>Charles Lindbeargh</PERSON>, cuddly and blue with
aviator's helmet and goggles, accompanied him on the long flight.
   ``<PERSON>Charles Lindbergh</PERSON> was one of my heroes,'' the young aviator
told reporters. ``So we decided on this trip, then next year
hopefully around the world.''
   He still wore his bright blue flight suit, with a baseball cap
reading ``<PERSON>Chris Marshall</PERSON> Tour'' covering his straw-colored hair, as
he sipped cola at a champagne and soft-drink reception inside an
airport hangar.
   Unlike <PERSON>Lindbergh</PERSON>, <PERSON>Christopher</PERSON> made several stops between <LOCATION>New
York</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> _ in <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Greenland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Iceland</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Scotland</LOCATION> _ and
had company and emergency help from retired <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> pilot <PERSON>Randy
Cunningham</PERSON>, 46. Their trip started in <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> on <DATE>July 7</DATE>.
   ``I didn't want to take an 11-year-old boy and make him fly for
20 hours straight,'' <PERSON>Cunningham</PERSON> said. ``I had a hard enough time
having him fly eight hours a day and keeping him awake. You know an
11-year-old boy wants to go to sleep when he gets tired.''
   Christopher's mother and friends who helped plan the trip said
they did not know who the previous youngest pilot to fly the
<LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> might have been, but they were confident no one younger
had done it.
   <PERSON>Cunningham</PERSON> said the youngster, who will enter fifth grade this
<DATE>fall</DATE>, is ``a very talented pilot. He flies better than some of the
adults I've flown with.''
   He first went into a cockpit when he was 4 years old _ with his
father, an airline pilot _ and began flying with an instructor when
he was 7.
   Last year he became the youngest pilot to fly across the <LOCATION>United
States</LOCATION>, but the record already has been broken. <PERSON>Christopher</PERSON> said he
was glad even younger kids have followed his example.
   ``I'm an ambassador to the youth of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>, and I'm showing all
kids across <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> that they can go out and accomplish their
dreams,'' he said.
   The scariest moment of the flight came <DATE>early Wednesday</DATE>, when the
plane's oil pressure fell and its engine began overheating in bad
weather between <LOCATION>Greenland</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Reykjavik</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Iceland</LOCATION>.
   Cunningham took the controls for the return to the southeast
coast of <LOCATION>Greenland</LOCATION> and had to pick his way through mountains to a
small airfield at <LOCATION>Kulusuk</LOCATION>, where clouds were just 100 feet off the
ground.
   ``Only one of a million pilots could have made that landing and
he did,'' <PERSON>Christopher</PERSON> said. ``We came so close to dying.''
   ``I didn't think we'd make it through. We had to fly at 50 feet
off the ground, because there were mountains and it was
quarter-mile visibility and all the ocean was iced up. It was
neat.''
   The former <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> pilot said <PERSON>Christopher</PERSON> was not exaggerating the
danger they had faced.
   ``I went back in the clouds and came back down and then went
back around the mountains for about 20 minutes, trying to find the
runway desperately,'' he said. ``I didn't think I was going to
live.''
   Because <PERSON>Cunningham</PERSON> only flew the plane while it was
backtracking, he and <PERSON>Christopher</PERSON> both consider the youngster to
have been the pilot for a complete transatlantic crossing.
   <PERSON>Mrs. Marshall</PERSON> said she worried throughout the voyage, while
waiting at a <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> hotel room, but didn't realize until later how
frightening the experience could be for her son.
   ``If I knew, I don't think I would have let him go,'' she said.
   After engine repairs in <LOCATION>Greenland</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Christopher</PERSON> took the controls
again for the flight to <LOCATION>Reykjavik</LOCATION>, then on to <LOCATION>Glasgow</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Scotland</LOCATION>,
where they stayed <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> before the final leg to <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>.

   An 11-year-old <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> boy bidding
to fly the <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> in a single-engine plane arrived in this
western Scottish port city <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> from <LOCATION>Iceland</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Christopher Lee Marshall</PERSON> said he plans to leave for <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>
<DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME> to complete his journey and become the youngest
pilot to cross the <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION>.
   The boy, from <LOCATION>Oceano</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, started his flight in <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, <DATE>July 7</DATE>. He said he hoped to reach Le Bourget airport
outside <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> at <TIME>11 a.m.</TIME> (<TIME>5 a.m. EDT</TIME>). Le Bourget is where <PERSON>Charles
Lindbergh</PERSON> completed his historic solo crossing in <DATE>1927</DATE>.
   Christopher and <PERSON>Randy Cunningham</PERSON>, a 46-year-old retired <ORGANIZATION>U.S.
Navy</ORGANIZATION> pilot who is accompanying the boy, don't regard the feat
accomplished until they reach <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>, following <PERSON>Lindbergh</PERSON>'s
tradition. The two stayed overnight at a <LOCATION>Glasgow</LOCATION> hotel.
   Earlier <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, <PERSON>Christopher</PERSON> landed his <PERSON>Mooney</PERSON> 252 aircraft at
<LOCATION>Reykjavik</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Iceland</LOCATION>'s capital, after flying about 450 miles from
<LOCATION>Kulusuk</LOCATION> on <LOCATION>Greenland</LOCATION>'s southeast coast in 2 hours, 15 minutes.
   On arrival at <LOCATION>Reykjavik</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Christopher</PERSON> said the flight was
pleasant but he was frightened <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> over <LOCATION>Greenland</LOCATION> when he was
forced to return to Kulusuk because of problems with low oil
pressure and an overheated engine.
   He said he flew the plane all the time but needed <PERSON>Cunningham</PERSON>'s
expert skills and knowledge to advise him on landing in <LOCATION>Greenland</LOCATION>.
   Asked why he was doing it, the boy said: ``I want to get kids
all over the world to accomplish their dreams.''
   Christopher has his teddy bear in the plane's back seat.
   ``He (the bear) doesn't like to sit in the back but I throw him
farther back if he starts complaining,'' he said.
   Cunningham limits <PERSON>Christopher</PERSON>'s daily flying time to eight
hours. He stopped in <LOCATION>St. Louis</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Montreal</LOCATION> before flying
to <LOCATION>Greenland</LOCATION>.
   Last year <PERSON>Christopher</PERSON> became the youngest pilot to cross the
<LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, a record that has since been broken by 9-year-old
<PERSON>Tony Aliengena</PERSON>.

<TEXT>
   An 11-year-old aviator who plans to emulate
<PERSON>Charles Lindbergh</PERSON>'s flight to <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> arrived in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> with a bit
of a scare.
   <PERSON>Christopher Lee Marshall</PERSON> was piloting his <PERSON>Mooney</PERSON> 252 two-seater
toward busy <LOCATION>La Guardia Airport</LOCATION> on <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>evening</TIME> when the plane's
electrical power _ and radio _ went dead.
   ``I thought we might get in trouble if we can't call the
tower,'' <PERSON>Chris</PERSON> said later.
   But the power outage lasted only about 10 seconds and he landed
safely.
   ``I thought it was neat to land at a big airport,'' the <LOCATION>Oceano</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, boy said.
   <PERSON>Chris</PERSON>, who is accompanied by a former <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> pilot, hopped across
the country from <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Kerrville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, then to <LOCATION>St. Louis</LOCATION>
and <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>.
   Today _ if the plane's electrical problems are sorted out _ he
and his companion planned to head toward <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>. His flight plan
calls for stops in <LOCATION>Montreal</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Greenland</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Iceland</LOCATION>.
   ``I want to show all other kids across <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> that if I can do
this trip, they can do this trip,'' <PERSON>Chris</PERSON> said <DATE>Friday</DATE> at <LOCATION>Lambert
Airport</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>St. Louis</LOCATION> before taking off for <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Chris</PERSON>, the son of a commercial pilot, first took the controls of
a plane at age 4, and began flying with an instructor at 7.
   Lindbergh flew from <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>St. Louis</LOCATION>, then to <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>
before completing his 33{-hour, non-stop solo flight across the
<LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> in <DATE>1927</DATE>.
   Last year, <PERSON>Chris</PERSON> became the youngest flier to cross the <LOCATION>United
States</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Tony Aliengena</PERSON>, a 9-year-old from <LOCATION>San Juan Capistrano</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, broke the record in <DATE>April</DATE> by making a
California-to-Massachusetts round trip.
   <PERSON>Chris</PERSON>, who will be a fifth-grader this <DATE>fall</DATE>, said this trip
would make him the world's youngest trans-Atlantic pilot. He is
accompanied by <PERSON>Randy</PERSON> ``Duke'' <PERSON>Cunningham</PERSON>, 46, a retired commander
at <LOCATION>Miramar Naval Air Station</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> War pilot.
   Cunningham sits in the pilot's seat in the two-seat craft.
<PERSON>Chris</PERSON>' seat is boosted to window-level by a foam cushion. But <PERSON>Chris</PERSON>
has done all of the flying, <PERSON>Cunningham</PERSON> said.
   The two flew to <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> in a borrowed plane, then traded it for a
new aircraft that was built for the trans-Atlantic journey.
   Because <PERSON>Cunningham</PERSON> is limiting the boy's flying time to less
than eight hours at a time, the flight will be stretched out over
five days.
   ``He's doing good; he's a tiger,'' <PERSON>Cunningham</PERSON> said. ``He was
sick on the flight from <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, but he flew right through it. He's
got around 270 hours of flying time in and he's very responsive.
Tell him to do something and he does it.''
   <PERSON>Chris</PERSON>' mother, <PERSON>Gail Marshall</PERSON>, founded a company that raised
money to pay for the flight.

   An 11-year-old boy accompanied by a retired
<ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> pilot ace today flew off on his quest to retrace <PERSON>Charles A.
Lindbergh</PERSON>'s historic flight to <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>, a 7,000-mile journey.
   <PERSON>Christopher Lee Marshall</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Oceano</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, and <PERSON>Randy
Cunningham</PERSON>, 46, departed from <ORGANIZATION>Montgomery Field</ORGANIZATION> at <TIME>8:32 a.m.</TIME> <DATE>today</DATE>
on the first leg of their trip to <LOCATION>Kerrville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>.
   The two, flying the first leg in a borrowed plane, will trade it
for a new Mooney 252 aircraft built for the trans-Atlantic journey.
Takeoff was originally scheduled for <DATE>Monday</DATE>, but was delayed by
storms in <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>.
   In <DATE>1927</DATE>, <PERSON>Lindbergh</PERSON> flew from <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>St. Louis</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mo.</LOCATION>, then
to <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION> before completing his 33{-hour non-stop solo
flight across the <LOCATION>Atlantic Ocean</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>.
   Because <PERSON>Cunningham</PERSON> is limiting the boy's flying time to less
than eight hours at a time, the trip will stretch out over five
days and include stops in <LOCATION>Kernville</LOCATION>; <LOCATION>St. Louis</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mo.</LOCATION>; <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>;
<LOCATION>Montreal</LOCATION>; Sondestrom, <LOCATION>Greenland</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Reykjavik</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Iceland</LOCATION>.
   According to <PERSON>Chris</PERSON>, the flight to <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> would make him the
world's youngest trans-Atlantic pilot.
   ``I'm very happy,'' he said shortly before takeoff. ``I am an
ambassador to the youth of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>, and I want to show all the
youth that if I can do my dreams, anyone can.''
   He said ``trying to stay awake'' would probably be the most
difficult part, ``but I will.''
   ``I'm not going to touch the controls unless there's an
emergency. <PERSON>Chris</PERSON>' aviation skills are phenomenal,'' <PERSON>Cunningham</PERSON>
said. The youngster has logged 200 hours, compared to <PERSON>Cunningham</PERSON>'s
more than 7,000 miles.
   <PERSON>Chris</PERSON>, the son of a commercial air pilot, gained fame last
<DATE>August</DATE> when at age 10 he became the youngest aviator to fly across
the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>.
   In <DATE>April</DATE>, however, a 9-year-old from <LOCATION>San Juan Capistrano</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Tony Aliengena</PERSON>, broke the record by making a
California-Massachusetts round trip.
   <PERSON>Chris</PERSON> and his mother, <PERSON>Gail Marshall</PERSON>, who live about 15 miles
south of <LOCATION>San Luis Obispo</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>central California</LOCATION>, recruited
<PERSON>Cunningham</PERSON> for this trip after meeting him at an air show last year.
   Cunningham, a retired <LOCATION>Miramar Naval Air Station</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>,
commander, was the only <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> pilot ace in the <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> War and is
the most-decorated <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> pilot, a <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> said.

   Though space was at a premium because of emergency gear required
for flights over the <LOCATION>North Atlantic</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Chris</PERSON> made room for his
stuffed bear, outfitted with goggles, named ``<PERSON>Charles Lindbeargh</PERSON>.''
   The fifth-grader, the son of a commercial pilot, is also
accompanied by <PERSON>Randy</PERSON> ``Duke'' <PERSON>Cunningham</PERSON>, 46, a retired <LOCATION>Miramar
Naval Air Station</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, commander and pilot in the <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> War.
   Cunningham sits in the pilot's seat in the two-seat craft.
<PERSON>Chris</PERSON>' seat is boosted to window-level by a foam cushion. But <PERSON>Chris</PERSON>
has done all of the flying, <PERSON>Cunningham</PERSON> said. The boy's flight time
is limited to less than eight hours at a stretch.
   Chris first took the controls of a plane at age 4, and began
flying with an instructor at age 7.
   Last year, he became the youngest flier to cross the <LOCATION>United
States</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Tony Aliengena</PERSON>, a 9-year-old from <LOCATION>San Juan Capistrano</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, broke the record in <DATE>April</DATE> by making a
California-Massachusetts round trip.
   <PERSON>Chris</PERSON> said this trip would make him the world's youngest
transatlantic pilot.
   Lindbergh flew from <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>St. Louis</LOCATION>, then to <LOCATION>New York
City</LOCATION> before completing his history-making solo flight across the
<LOCATION>Atlantic Ocean</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> in <DATE>1927</DATE>. The non-stop flight took 33{ hours.

<TEXT>
   An 11-year-old <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> boy today
became the youngest pilot to cross the <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION>, landing at the
<LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> airport where <PERSON>Charles Lindbergh</PERSON> completed a historic solo
crossing in <DATE>1927</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Christopher Lee Marshall</PERSON> touched down his single-engine plane at
Le Bourget airport on a flight from <LOCATION>Glasgow</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Scotland</LOCATION>, where he
spent the night.
   The boy aviator was greeted by his mother as he stepped from the
plane wearing a bright blue flight suit and a baseball cap with a
sign reading ``<PERSON>Chris Marshall</PERSON> Tour.''
   ``We're finally here. We made it,'' he said, grinning ear-to-ear
but looking tired.
   ``Mommy missed you so much. Give me a kiss,'' said his mother,
<PERSON>Gail Marshall</PERSON>, who waved an American flag and clutched a stuffed
bear intended as a present for her son.
   The young aviator from <LOCATION>Oceano</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, then kissed his mother.
   Christopher started his flight in <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> on <DATE>July 7</DATE>. He was
accompanied by retired <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> pilot <PERSON>Randy Cunningham</PERSON>, 46, who limited
<PERSON>Marshall</PERSON>'s flying time to eight-hour stretches.
   A champagne and cola reception was held in the hangar of the
airport, north of <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>.
   Despite the trans-Atlantic venture, which included stops in <LOCATION>St.
Louis</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Montreal</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Greenland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Iceland</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Scotland</LOCATION>,
<PERSON>Christopher</PERSON> revealed his youth.
   On stepping from the plane, his first words to his mother were:
``I have to go to the toilet.'' He disappeared briefly then
returned to pose for photographers.
   At one point, <PERSON>Christopher</PERSON> re-entered the aircraft to produce his
old stuffed bear, from which he has said he is inseparable.
Photographers snapped pictures of Christopher with the cuddly
animal in its goggles and helmet and bearing a sign with its name
``<PERSON>Charles Lindbeargh</PERSON>.''
   Christopher arrived in <LOCATION>Glasgow</LOCATION> <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> after an 840-mile
flight from <LOCATION>Reykjavik</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Iceland</LOCATION> in his single-engine <PERSON>Mooney</PERSON> 252
aircraft.
   He arrived in <LOCATION>Reykjavik</LOCATION> early <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> after flying about 450
miles from <LOCATION>Kulusuk</LOCATION> on <LOCATION>Greenland</LOCATION>'s southeast coast in 2 hours 15
minutes.
   The arrival in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> was delayed by one day due to engine
troubles <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> that forced the plane back to <LOCATION>Greenland</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Cunningham</PERSON> said he took over the controls to fly the plane 50
miles back to <LOCATION>Greenland</LOCATION> after engine trouble and bad weather with
low visibility made the situation critical.
   He said it was the only time during the flight that he took
control of the aircraft.
   <PERSON>Cunningham</PERSON> said he had trouble finding the air field at <LOCATION>Kukusuk</LOCATION>,
an island of <LOCATION>Greenland</LOCATION>'s southeast coast: ``We would have had to
ditch at sea. I didn't think I was going to live.''
   The oil filter cap had rattled loose so the oil pressure
plummeted and the engine overheated.
   Christopher's mother said her son began flying with his father
at the age of 4 and began training with an instructor at age 7.
   She said she was worried by the problems <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
   ``If I knew, I don't think I would have let him go,'' she said.

   A federal appeals court <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> rejected
efforts by the wife of <PERSON>Bruno Richard Hauptmann</PERSON> to clear his name in
the <DATE>1932</DATE> kidnapping-murder of the son of aviator <PERSON>Charles Lindbergh</PERSON>
   In a one-sentence statement, the 3rd <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals</ORGANIZATION> here affirmed a <DATE>September 1987</DATE> ruling by <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> District
<PERSON>Judge Garrett E. Brown Jr.</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Trenton</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Robert R. Bryan</PERSON>, the attorney of <PERSON>Anna Hauptmann</PERSON>, vowed to take
his appeal to the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``We are undaunted,'' he said in a telephone interview from his
<LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> office. ``Our goal remains the same: to clear her
husband's name during her life.''
   <PERSON>Mrs. Hauptmann</PERSON>, 89, lives in <LOCATION>Yeadon</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pa</LOCATION>.
   Her husband was convicted in the <DATE>March 1, 1932</DATE>, kidnapping and
murder of the 20-month-old son of <PERSON>Lindbergh</PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON>Anne

<LOCATION>Flemington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION> that earned international attention, and was
executed <DATE>April 3, 1936</DATE>, at <ORGANIZATION>Trenton State Prison</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>Mrs. Hauptmann</PERSON> charged in a federal lawsuit that the case
against her husband should be reopened. The legal action was based
on new evidence <PERSON>Bryan</PERSON> said he uncovered, including more than 22,000
pages of documents and lost trial evidence found three years ago in
the garage of the late <PERSON>Harold G. Hoffman</PERSON>, <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION>'s governor at
the time of the trial and execution.
   The lawsuit claimed that the trial was riddled with
mispresentations and fraud, evidence was suppressed, witnesses were
coerced or lied on the state and testimony was changed.

<TEXT>
   <PERSON>David T. Wilentz</PERSON>, who gained worldwide
attention in <DATE>1935</DATE> when he prosecuted <PERSON>Bruno Richard Hauptmann</PERSON> for
the kidnap and murder of the <PERSON>Lindbergh</PERSON> baby, has died at age 93.
   <PERSON>Wilentz</PERSON>, the father of state <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> Chief Justice <PERSON>Robert
N. Wilentz</PERSON>, died ``peacefully in his sleep'' <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> night at his
<DATE>summer</DATE> home in <LOCATION>Long Branch</LOCATION>, said <PERSON>Anne Riegle</PERSON>, a family spokeswoman.
   Gov. <PERSON>Thomas H. Kean</PERSON> said <PERSON>Wilentz</PERSON>'s death ``marks the passing of
a figure and personality of near legendary proportions.''
   His death came hours after a federal appeals court in
<LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> rejected the most recent effort of <PERSON>Hauptmann</PERSON>'s widow,
<PERSON>Anna</PERSON>, to clear her husband's name.
   Born in <LOCATION>Dwinsk</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Latvia</LOCATION>, on <DATE>Dec. 21, 1894</DATE>, <PERSON>Wilentz</PERSON> came to the
<LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> at age 6 and became a naturalized citizen in <DATE>1900</DATE>.
   As a young state attorney general, he handled his first criminal
case when he prosecuted <PERSON>Hauptmann</PERSON> in what became known as ``the
trial of the century.''
   <PERSON>Hauptmann</PERSON> was convicted of kidnapping the 20-month-old son of
aviator <PERSON>Charles Lindbergh</PERSON> from his <LOCATION>East Amwell</LOCATION> estate and then
murdering the child. He was executed <DATE>April 3, 1936</DATE>, at <ORGANIZATION>Trenton
State Prison</ORGANIZATION>.
   The trial was followed worldwide and journalist <PERSON>H.L. Mencken</PERSON>
called it ``the biggest event since the Resurrection.'' <PERSON>Wilentz</PERSON>,
who personally opposed the death penalty, was noted during the
trial for his eloquence.
   Some students of the case and <PERSON>Mrs. Hauptmann</PERSON> continue to claim
<PERSON>Hauptmann</PERSON> was innocent and was railroaded during the trial.
   After a decade as attorney general, <PERSON>Wilentz</PERSON>, whose main home was
in <LOCATION>Perth Amboy</LOCATION>, served as chairman of the state <ORGANIZATION>Democratic
Committee</ORGANIZATION>.
   Although he considered running for governor, he later told
friends he decided that <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> at that time would not elect a
Jewish governor.
   Wilentz went on to found one of the most prominent and powerful
law firms in the state. He also was the former director of the
board of <ORGANIZATION>Amerada Hess Corp</ORGANIZATION>.
   Despite his advancing age, <PERSON>Wilentz</PERSON> continued to report for work
frequently at the family's <PERSON>Woodbridge</PERSON> law firm, and he had spent
some time working at the firm <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
   ``He was active from the time he was admitted to practice law in
<DATE>1919</DATE> right to the present,'' <PERSON>Ms. Riegle</PERSON> said.
   She said funeral arrangements were pending.
   Wilentz is survived by his wife, <PERSON>Lena</PERSON>; sons <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> and <PERSON>Warren</PERSON>;
and his daughter <PERSON>Norma Hess</PERSON>.

<TEXT>
   The <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION>'s oldest civilian engineer retired
<DATE>Friday</DATE>, after a career that spanned two world wars and included a
stint helping <PERSON>Charles Lindbergh</PERSON> design the pontooned planes he flew
to <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Rudy Ries</PERSON>, 89, was honored during ceremonies at the <ORGANIZATION>Naval
Training Systems Center</ORGANIZATION> for his achievement of being the oldest
full-time civilian employee in the <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``You've been an inspiration to us all,'' said Capt. <PERSON>C.D. Rowley</PERSON>,
commanding officer of the <ORGANIZATION>Naval Training Systems Center</ORGANIZATION>, as he
presented <PERSON>Ries</PERSON> with a number of certificates, letters of
commendation and a plaque. ``We are all proud you were one of us.''
   In a letter read to <PERSON>Ries</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON>H. Lawrence Garrett III</PERSON>
thanked him for his 26 years of dedicated service.
   When the German-born <PERSON>Ries</PERSON> joined the <ORGANIZATION>German Air Force</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1916</DATE>,
World War I had ended before he could become a fighter pilot. In
<DATE>1928</DATE>, he saw the onset of Naziism in his country and came to <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>
as a mechanical engineer.
   Ries began his latest career in <DATE>1963</DATE> and might have continued in
his job, he said in an interview, if his wife, <PERSON>Julia</PERSON>, hadn't died
last year and if the nature of his engineering work hadn't changed.
   He's a hands-on engineer and much of today's engineering is just
paperwork, <PERSON>Ries</PERSON> said. In effect, he said, they've taken away his
drafting board.
   ``I enjoy engineering. I think engineering is designing things,
creating things,'' he said. ``But one thing we've turned to now is
just writing specifications ... for somebody else to build
something. I don't like this.''
   He described the reams of specifications turned out by today's
engineers as ``letters to <LOCATION>Santa Claus</LOCATION>.''
   In earlier years, <PERSON>Ries</PERSON> worked with <PERSON>Lindbergh</PERSON> and Adm. <PERSON>Richard
Byrd</PERSON> in designing pontoons for the planes they flew to <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and the
<LOCATION>South Pole</LOCATION>.
   He worked first for <ORGANIZATION>Fairchild Aviation</ORGANIZATION> and then <ORGANIZATION>Merganthaler
Linotype Co.</ORGANIZATION> before joining EDO Aircraft on <LOCATION>Long Island</LOCATION> in <DATE>1930</DATE>. He
became an American citizen in that year.
   It was at EDO that he worked with <PERSON>Lindbergh</PERSON> and <PERSON>Byrd</PERSON>.
   ``<PERSON>Lindbergh</PERSON> and his wife were flying to <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and he wanted
special floats outfitted to the bottom of the plane, with a motor in
between, in case he landed in the water,'' <PERSON>Ries</PERSON> said.
   The <PERSON>Lindbergh</PERSON>'s returned to <ORGANIZATION>EDO</ORGANIZATION> aircraft after their flight to
<LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and had lunch with <PERSON>Ries</PERSON> and other company officials. ``I
loaned him my pocketknife to cut his onions with, and I've still got
that knife,'' <PERSON>Ries</PERSON> said.
   He helped design one of the world's first high-altitude metal
planes, was a consultant in the <LOCATION>Ukraine</LOCATION> to Soviet builders of the
American-designed PBY flying boat and worked for the <ORGANIZATION>Fokker Aircraft

<TEXT>
   The <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION>'s oldest civilian employee, an
89-year-old engineer, has retired and is going back to <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>,
where he launched a career in aviation that spanned six decades.
   <PERSON>Rudy Ries</PERSON> came to this country in <DATE>1928</DATE> and worked for 35 years
for companies that pioneered in aviation: Fairchild, <ORGANIZATION>Convair</ORGANIZATION>,
<PERSON>Martin</PERSON>, EDO Aircraft and for <ORGANIZATION>Fokker</ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION>Netherlands</LOCATION>. He helped
design pontoons for the planes flown by <PERSON>Charles Lindbergh</PERSON> to <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>
and by Adm. <PERSON>Richard Byrd</PERSON> to the <LOCATION>South Pole</LOCATION>.
   ``I've enjoyed my work, all of it,'' he said sadly at a
retirement ceremony at the <ORGANIZATION>Naval Training Systems Center</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Friday</DATE>.
``I will miss it.''
   He said he would fly to <LOCATION>Bonn</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION>, this weekend to live
with his son, a civil engineer posted with the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. State Department</ORGANIZATION>
there.
   The diminutive, soft-spoken <PERSON>Ries</PERSON> worked ``only'' 26 years for the
<ORGANIZATION>Navy Department</ORGANIZATION>, starting in <DATE>1963</DATE>.
   Born in <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION>, he joined the German air force during World
War I, but he hadn't completed pilot training when it ended. In
<DATE>1928</DATE>, he saw the onset of Nazism in his country and came to <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>.
   He became a citizen in <DATE>1930</DATE>, the year he joined EDO on <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>'s
<LOCATION>Long Island</LOCATION>.
   ``<PERSON>Lindbergh</PERSON> and his wife were flying to <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and he wanted
special floats outfitted to the bottom of the plane, with a motor in
between, in case he landed in the water,'' <PERSON>Ries</PERSON> said.
   The Lindberghs returned to <ORGANIZATION>EDO</ORGANIZATION> after their flight to <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and
had lunch with <PERSON>Ries</PERSON> and other company officials.
   ``I loaned him my pocket knife to cut his onions with, and I've
still got that knife,'' <PERSON>Ries</PERSON> said.
   Another highlight of his two stints at <ORGANIZATION>EDO</ORGANIZATION> was the design of an
all-metal airplane designed to operate at 30,000 feet, a two-seater
named the Model-R in his honor. The Depression caused the company to
cut back work on it and the Model-R was never flown.
   In <DATE>1936</DATE>, <PERSON>Ries</PERSON> went to work for <ORGANIZATION>Consolidated Aircraft</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, which later became Convair.
   From there, he and 20 other engineers and assistants were sent to
the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> to help in setting up an assembly plant. After
spending more than a year in the <LOCATION>Ukraine</LOCATION>, he got a job at <ORGANIZATION>Fokker
Aircraft Co.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Amsterdam</LOCATION>. But <PERSON>Ries</PERSON>' European stay was cut short
with the approach of World War II, and he returned to this country.
   A hands-on mechanical engineer, he admitted frustration with his
profession's increasing reliance on paperwork, which he called
``letters to <LOCATION>Santa Claus</LOCATION>.''
   ``I enjoy engineering. I think engineering is designing things,
creating things,'' he said. ``But one thing we've turned to now is
just writing specifications ... for somebody else to build
something. I don't like this.''
   In recent years, he has designed training simulators for the
controllers who explode Tomahawk and Harm missiles when they fail to
detonate or go off course. He also is responsible for the design of
a training aid for the military's newest torpedo, the Mark 50, which
can be dropped from an airplane or fired from land or ships at sea.

   An 11-year-old pilot left <LOCATION>Montreal</LOCATION> <DATE>Monday</DATE> on the
next part of his <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> journey after his plane was
grounded for a day by mechanical trouble.
   <PERSON>Christopher Lee Marshall</PERSON> left <LOCATION>Dorval</LOCATION> airport at <TIME>2:42 p.m. EDT</TIME>
headed for <LOCATION>Wabush</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Labrador</LOCATION>, in a single-engine <PERSON>Mooney</PERSON> 252
two-seater, said <PERSON>Doug McGurk</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Transport Canada</ORGANIZATION> spokesman.
   The boy from <LOCATION>Oceano</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, has said the trip will make him the
world's youngest transatlantic pilot and he wants to make the trip
to emulate <PERSON>Charles Lindberg</PERSON>'s <DATE>1927</DATE> flight to <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>. One of his
other goals is to become the youngest pilot to fly around the world.
   The fifth-grade student and son of a commercial pilot is
accompanied by <PERSON>Randy Cunningham</PERSON>, 40, a retired pilot who served in
the <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> war. Cunningham limits the boy's flying time to less
than eight hours at a stretch.
   They are scheduled to fly to <LOCATION>Greenland</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Iceland</LOCATION> before
arriving in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>. The trip began in <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> <DATE>last Thursday</DATE>.
   They had been scheduled to leave <LOCATION>Montreal</LOCATION> <DATE>Sunday</DATE> but were unable
to take off because a voltage regulator aboard the plane had to be
repaired.
   <PERSON>McGurk</PERSON> said the flight from <LOCATION>Montreal</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Wabush</LOCATION>, at 21,000 feet,
would take nearly four hours.
   Lindbergh flew from <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>St. Louis</LOCATION>, then to <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>
before completing his 33{-hour non-stop solo flight across the
<LOCATION>Atlantic Ocean</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>.
   Christopher first took the controls of a plane at age four and
began flying with an instructor three years later.
   Last year he became the youngest pilot to cross the <LOCATION>United
States</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Tony Aliengena</PERSON>, a 9-year-old from <LOCATION>San Juan Capistrano</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, broke the record in <DATE>April</DATE> by making a
California-to-Massachusetts round trip.

<TEXT>
   Imagine a brash astronaut thumbing his nose
at the space agency and taking an old <ORGANIZATION>Mercury</ORGANIZATION> spacecraft all the
way to the moon, then claiming it was a mistake, and you get a
glimmer of <PERSON>Douglas</PERSON> ``Wrong Way'' <PERSON>Corrigan</PERSON>'s feat 50 years ago.
   ``My compass froze. I guess I flew the wrong way,'' <PERSON>Corrigan</PERSON>
claimed on <DATE>July 18, 1938</DATE>, after making a forbidden New
York-to-Dublin flight in a used Curtiss-Robin monoplane on which
he'd spent <MONEY>$900</MONEY>. Plus <MONEY>$90</MONEY> for gas and oil.
   He has steadfastly maintained he thought he was returning to his
home base of <LOCATION>Long Beach</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, after federal aviation authorities
denied him permission to fly to <LOCATION>Ireland</LOCATION>.
   But <PERSON>Corrigan</PERSON>, now 81 and living in <LOCATION>Santa Ana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, hinted in
a telephone interview last week that his wrong-way explanation may
change after he flies again to <LOCATION>Dublin</LOCATION> on <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, this time as an
honored guest for three days of ceremonies commemorating his flight.
   ``Maybe this time over in <LOCATION>Dublin</LOCATION>, I'll tell them another story.
We'll see,'' he said <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   Corrigan's ``wrong-way'' explanation sounded like pure blarney
at the time _he was made a lifetime member of the <ORGANIZATION>Liars Club</ORGANIZATION> _ but
<LOCATION>America</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Ireland</LOCATION> loved it.
   He was the overnight guest of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> ambassadors in <LOCATION>Dublin</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>London</LOCATION>. After he returned to <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> by ship, with his plane in a
crate, he was given a ticker-tape parade. There was even a meeting
with President <PERSON>Franklin Roosevelt</PERSON>.
   A movie was turned out by RKO Studios,``The Flying Irishman,''
starring <PERSON>Corrigan</PERSON> as himself, and there were magazine articles and
an autobiography, ``That's My Story.'' He estimated he grossed
<MONEY>$85,000</MONEY> from tours and speeches.
   As punishment for his journey, the <ORGANIZATION>Bureau of Air Commerce</ORGANIZATION>,
forerunner of the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Aviation Administration</ORGANIZATION>, suspended
<PERSON>Corrigan</PERSON> from flying for five days. Those five days were served
while he was still aboard ship on the way home.
   Whatever the true story, <PERSON>Corrigan</PERSON> had joined the ranks of his
hero, <PERSON>Charles Lindbergh</PERSON>, and <ORGANIZATION>Wiley Post</ORGANIZATION> by making a solo, nonstop,
single-engine crossing of the <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION>.
   He also dispelled the notion that air feats were only for
millionaires and well-financed aviators.
   When <PERSON>Corrigan</PERSON> was 20, he was a woodworker at <ORGANIZATION>Ryan Aircraft</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> and helped build <PERSON>Lindbergh</PERSON>'s Spirit of <LOCATION>St. Louis</LOCATION> for the
<DATE>1927</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>New York-to-Paris</ORGANIZATION> solo trans-Atlantic flight.
   Corrigan got his pilot's license the next year. He bought a
leather flight jacket just like <PERSON>Lindy</PERSON>'s, scraped his money together
and studied navigation.
   He bought his monoplane for <MONEY>$310</MONEY> in <DATE>1931</DATE>, and spent an
additional <MONEY>$590</MONEY> modifying it into a long-distance machine. Before
the flight to <LOCATION>Ireland</LOCATION>, he flew from <LOCATION>Long Beach</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> nonstop
in 27 hours on <DATE>July 7-8</DATE>.
   Then the <ORGANIZATION>Bureau of Air Commerce</ORGANIZATION> refused to grant permission for
a trans-Atlantic flight, on grounds his plane, loaded with 330
gallons of gasoline and five gallons of oil, was <PERCENT>55 percent</PERCENT> too
heavy for a safe flight.
   Corrigan took off from <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Floyd Bennett</PERSON> Field on <DATE>July
17</DATE>, saying he was headed for <LOCATION>Long Beach</LOCATION>. He landed at <LOCATION>Dublin</LOCATION> 28
hours and <TIME>13 minutes later</TIME>, 3,150 miles from <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>.
   ``There had been a haze near the ground and when I was 500 feet
high, there was fog below the plane,'' <PERSON>Corrigan</PERSON> once said of his
flight. ``When I started to turn west I noticed the top compass was
not working right, due to the liquid having leaked out. ... There
was another compass down on the floor that I had set to fly a
westerly course, so now I turned the plane until the parallel lines
matched, and flew over the fog.''
   The wrong way.
   He had no radio and his <MONEY>$1</MONEY> wristwatch stopped. ``The only modern
instrument I had was a turn-and-bank indicator,'' said <PERSON>Corrigan</PERSON>,
who subsisted on fig and chocolate bars and some water during his
flight.
   ``I knew I wasn't in <LOCATION>Long Beach</LOCATION> when I dropped out of the
overcast over <LOCATION>Dublin</LOCATION>,'' he said. ``The place was greener and some
of the houses had hay roofs.''
   Corrigan will be the guest of <ORGANIZATION>Aer Lingus</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Sunday</DATE> when the
Irish airline takes him to <LOCATION>Dublin</LOCATION> aboard a <ORGANIZATION>Boeing</ORGANIZATION> 747.
   ``We offered him a first-class seat, but he said he would prefer
to fly economy,'' said <ORGANIZATION>Aer Lingus</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>Bill Maxwell</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Dublin</LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
   It wasn't quite <PERSON>Lindbergh</PERSON>, but a <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> university
professor earned his footnote in aviation history <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> when he
completed the first trans-Atlantic flight in an ethanol-fueled
airplane.
   <PERSON>Max Shauck</PERSON>, a mathematics instructor at <ORGANIZATION>Baylor University</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Waco</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, landed at the small Toussus-le-Noble airport southwest
of <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> after a one-hour flight from Tours.
   He set out with Italian co-pilot <PERSON>Grazia Zanin</PERSON> from <LOCATION>Waco</LOCATION> on <DATE>Sept.
15</DATE> in a light experimental aircraft that carried them through often
rough weather to <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>Azores</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> and finally
<LOCATION>France</LOCATION>.
   ``We feel we have proved that ethanol is a very reliable fuel,''
<PERSON>Shauck</PERSON> said. ``You can't get across the <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> on an unreliable
fuel.''
   Proving the merits of the relatively cheap, non-polluting
ethanol compared to standard fuel drove <PERSON>Shauck</PERSON> make the journey,
which he funded himself at more cost ``than I care to think about.''
   Ethanol is essentially an alcohol fuel made from vegetable
matter, usually corn in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and sugar beets in
<LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Shauck</PERSON>, who also does air pollution research at <LOCATION>Baylor</LOCATION>,
says ethanol retails for about <MONEY>$1.20</MONEY> per gallon in the <LOCATION>United
States</LOCATION> compared to <MONEY>$1.80</MONEY> for high-octane aviation fuel.
   ``It produces more power, it burns cooler and there's a lot less
pollution,'' he said. ``But we had to go out of our way sometimes
to find it.''
   Indeed, <PERSON>Shauck</PERSON> and <PERSON>Zanin</PERSON>'s flight log includes a hodgepodge of
small stopovers in <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION> chosen chiefly because ethanol
could be delivered there.
   These included <LOCATION>Paducah</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ky.</LOCATION>; <LOCATION>Newark</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>; <LOCATION>Hazelton</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pa.</LOCATION>; and
<LOCATION>Suffolk</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y</LOCATION>. The plane also stopped at <PERSON>Shauck</PERSON>'s hometown of
<LOCATION>Mansfield</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>.
   In <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>, they stopped at <LOCATION>Moncton</LOCATION> and St. Pierre-et-Miquelon
before lifting off from <ORGANIZATION>St. John's</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Newfoundland</LOCATION> on <DATE>Oct. 20</DATE> for
Flores in the <LOCATION>Azore Islands</LOCATION>, a 2,000-mile crossing made terrifying
by rain and thunderstorms.
   ``It's a long way over a lot of water when you're flying a
little plane looking for little islands,'' he said. ``We didn't
have sophisticated navigation equipment.''
   They waited in the <LOCATION>Azores</LOCATION> for nearly three weeks for a shipment
of ethanol to arrive before flying to <LOCATION>Lisbon</LOCATION> <DATE>Nov. 10</DATE>. <PERSON>Shauck</PERSON>, 54,
and <PERSON>Ms. Zanin</PERSON>, 33, made stops in <LOCATION>Bilbao</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Bordeaux</LOCATION>,
Rochet-Sur-Yon and Tours in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>.
   Technically, they became the first people to cross the <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION>
in an ethanol-fueled plane the minute they touched down in
<LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION>, but the original plan they filed with American
authorities was from <LOCATION>Suffolk County</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>, airport to <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>.
   The fiberglass aircraft, a sort of flying wing built by the
<ORGANIZATION>Velocity Corp.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Sebastian</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla.</LOCATION>, featured elevators, normally
found on the tail, at the front of the airplane and a propellor
mounted on the back.
   The whole contraption weighs about 2,100 pounds and can reach a
top speed of 200 mph.
   Shauck resists comparison with American aviator <PERSON>Charles
Lindbergh</PERSON>, first man to cross the <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> in a flight from <LOCATION>New
York</LOCATION> to Le Bourget airport in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> on <DATE>May 31, 1927</DATE>.
   ``He is a hero,'' <PERSON>Shauck</PERSON> said. ``Everything now is different
than it was in his day. I avoided going to Le Bourget because I
didn't want to be compared to him.''
   <PERSON>Shauck</PERSON> said he would take a commercial flight back to <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, but
that the aircraft will make one more trip _ to <PERSON>Ms. Zanin</PERSON>'s
hometown, <LOCATION>Trieste</LOCATION>.

   The ticker tape parade <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> for <ORGANIZATION>Nelson
Mandela</ORGANIZATION> is the fifth in the last 10 years through <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>'s
``Canyon of Heroes'' on lower Broadway.
   There have been about twoscore such parades since <PERSON>Charles
Lindbergh</PERSON> was lionized here in <DATE>1927</DATE>. Aviators, athletes and
warriors predominate.
   Among the notable parades:
   <DATE>1986</DATE> _ <LOCATION>New York Mets</LOCATION>, after beating the <ORGANIZATION>Boston Red Sox</ORGANIZATION> in the
World Series.
   <DATE>1985</DATE> _ 25,000 <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> veterans, led by Gen. <PERSON>William Westmoreland</PERSON>
and 26 Medal of Honor winners, in a 10-years-later welcome-home
tribute.
   <DATE>1984</DATE> _ 221 athletes of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Olympic team are cheered, but
101 spectators are injured when a construction scaffold on the
parade route gives way.
   <DATE>1981</DATE> _ Welcome home for the Americans hostages freed from <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION>.
   <DATE>1979</DATE> _ Pope <PERSON>John Paul II</PERSON>.
   1978 _ <ORGANIZATION>New York Yankees</ORGANIZATION> world champion team.
   1969 _ ``Miracle'' Mets world champion team.
   <DATE>1969</DATE> _ Astronauts <PERSON>Neil Armstrong</PERSON> and <PERSON>Buzz Aldrin</PERSON>, the first men
to land on the moon, and fellow Apollo 11 astronaut <PERSON>Michael Collins</PERSON>.
   <DATE>1963</DATE> _ Astronaut <PERSON>Gordon Cooper</PERSON>.
   1962 _ Astronaut <PERSON>John Glenn</PERSON>, the first American in orbit.
   1958 _ <PERSON>Van Cliburn</PERSON>, the only classical musician ever to get the
ticker-tape treatment, after winning piano competition in <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION>.
   1951 _ Gen. <PERSON>Douglas MacArthur</PERSON>, after his recall from <LOCATION>Korea</LOCATION> by
President <PERSON>Truman</PERSON>.
   1938 _ <PERSON>Douglas</PERSON> ``Wrong-Way'' <PERSON>Corrigan</PERSON>, for his air flight to
<LOCATION>Ireland</LOCATION> while claiming his destination was <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>.
   1938 _ <PERSON>Howard Hughes</PERSON> and his plane crew, for breaking <ORGANIZATION>Wiley
Post</ORGANIZATION>'s round-the-world flight record.
   1936 _ <PERSON>Beryl Markham</PERSON>, for the first westward trans-Atlantic solo
flight, described later in her memoir ``West With the Night.''
   1928 _ <PERSON>Amelia Earhart</PERSON>, first woman to fly the <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION>, as
navigator, before making her own solo flight some years later.
   1927 _ <LOCATION>Lindbergh</LOCATION>, after returning from solo flight to <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>.
   Several of the parades were larger in scope than the traditional
route from <ORGANIZATION>Bowling Green to City Hall</ORGANIZATION>, a canyon about 16 blocks
long formed by the office towers along Broadway in the financial
district.
   Glenn's parade, which wended through midtown as well as lower
<LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION>, produced the greatest fallout of paper in any ticker
tape parade, 3,474 tons, according to <ORGANIZATION>Sanitation Department</ORGANIZATION> records.
   The most paper generated by a canyon-only parade was 1,262 for
the <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> hostage parade.
   Official estimates of spectator numbers have been extravagant.
The Mets<DATE>' 1986</DATE> parade was reported as drawing 2.2 million people.
That works out to 137,000 people per block, or enough to fill Shea
Stadium 2{ times.

<TEXT>
   A bit of aviation history was made in this
city where <PERSON>Charles Lindbergh</PERSON> learned to fly.
   Twenty corporate aircraft, half of them the popular Learjets,
were put on the auction block <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> in a first-of-its-kind
event for the aircraft industry.
   ``This has never been done before in aviation, save for an
occasional bankruptcy sale and sales of smaller or antique
planes,'' said <PERSON>J. Robert Duncan</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Duncan Aviation</ORGANIZATION>.
   The sale was also a first for <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby</ORGANIZATION>'s, the international
auction house that specializes in fine art and antiques. <PERSON>John L.
Marion</PERSON>, the head of <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby</ORGANIZATION>'s North American operations, wielded
the gavel.
   Within an hour, <PERSON>Duncan</PERSON> crews wheeled the aircraft, one-by-one,
through a clean aircraft hangar. There, <PERSON>Marion</PERSON> bellowed the
auctioneer's mantra: ``I have <MONEY>$2 million</MONEY> to start, I have 2
million.''
   When it was over, five airplanes had been sold for a total of
<MONEY>$7,927,750</MONEY>. Two others, including the most expensive one offered,
were snapped up before the sale, bringing the total to more than
<MONEY>$20 million</MONEY>, <PERSON>Marion</PERSON> said.
   Duncan, who heads the 30-year-old business aviation sales and
service with 550 employees in 14 cities, said he was pleased with
the sale, but had greater expectations.
   ``We'll analyze the results and evaluate whether or not we want
to make this an annual event. I think we might have another sale,''
he said.
   Prices paid ranged from <MONEY>$309,750</MONEY> for a <DATE>1980</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>Piper Cheyenne</ORGANIZATION> I to
``about <MONEY>$14 million</MONEY> to <MONEY>$15 million</MONEY>'' for a <DATE>1988</DATE> Canadair Challenger
_ one of the two sold before the auction, <PERSON>Duncan</PERSON> said.
   <PERSON>Gary Conklin</PERSON>, a representative of <ORGANIZATION>Great Planes Sales Inc.</ORGANIZATION> of
<LOCATION>Tulsa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Okla.</LOCATION>, picked up a <LOCATION>Westwind</LOCATION> 1124 for <MONEY>$2.1 million</MONEY>. He said
his company buys planes, renovates them and then looks for a buyer.
   The names of other buyers were not made public.
   Lindbergh studied flying at the old <ORGANIZATION>Lincoln School of Aviation</ORGANIZATION>
in the <DATE>1920s</DATE>. He made his solo flight of the <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> in <DATE>May 1927</DATE>.

   In a cramped gondola dangling beneath
an 11-story helium balloon, with clouds obstructing any view below,
the disembodied voice of the radar operator seemed scarcely to be
believed.
   ``You have crossed the coast of <LOCATION>Ireland</LOCATION>,'' the voice told three
American balloonists on that still-dark early morning 10 years ago.
<PERSON>Larry Newman</PERSON> asked if the message was indeed that which had eluded
others for 105 years.
   Silence.
   Then, crisply, ``Sir, my radar is never wrong.''
   Newman, along with <PERSON>Ben Abruzzo</PERSON> and <PERSON>Maxie Anderson</PERSON>, whooped with
joy. Sunburned and weary after five days aloft, the
businessmen-adventurers had made the first trans-Atlantic crossing
in a balloon.
   The three landed their black-and-silver Double Eagle II later
that day, <DATE>Aug. 17, 1978</DATE>, in a wheat field west of <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>.
   Today, <PERSON>Newman</PERSON> is the only one of the three still alive.
   <PERSON>Anderson</PERSON> was killed in <DATE>1983</DATE> at age 48 when his balloon crashed
in a West German forest during a race. Abruzzo, then 53, died in
<DATE>1985</DATE> when his twin-engine airplane crashed shortly after takeoff in
<LOCATION>Albuquerque</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Newman</PERSON>, now 40 and a commercial airline pilot in <LOCATION>Phoenix</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ariz.</LOCATION>,
said he has no specific plans to celebrate <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>'s anniversary.
   But he said his thoughts often drifted back to that <DATE>summer 10
years ago</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Newman</PERSON> recalled that after the initial jubilation, <PERSON>Anderson</PERSON> went
to sleep while he and <PERSON>Abruzzo</PERSON> looked down through the clearing
clouds on the lights of <LOCATION>Dublin</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ireland</LOCATION>.
   The silent 112-foot balloon 15,000 feet up caught sounds that
drifted skyward. <PERSON>Newman</PERSON> and <PERSON>Abruzzo</PERSON> could hear dogs barking and
trains rumbling along tracks nearly 3 miles below.
   ``Tears came to my eyes,'' <PERSON>Newman</PERSON> said. ``I put my arm around
<PERSON>Ben</PERSON> _ he'd always been somewhat like a father to me. I hadn't felt
that close to another human being for as long as I can remember.''
   The men began the flight six days earlier when the <ORGANIZATION>Double Eagle
II</ORGANIZATION> lifted up from <LOCATION>Presque Isle</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION>, and headed toward <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>
more than 3,000 miles away.
   <PERSON>Newman</PERSON> says the flight was not without problems, including a
clash of personalities.
   ``<PERSON>Maxie Anderson</PERSON> later stated that he wished he could have flown
the flight by himself,'' <PERSON>Newman</PERSON> said. ``I don't know what <PERSON>Ben</PERSON>'s
feelings were, but I wanted someone to share this with. I didn't
want to be <PERSON>Charles Lindbergh</PERSON>.''
   <PERSON>Newman</PERSON> said conflicts arose when <PERSON>Anderson</PERSON> and <PERSON>Abruzzo</PERSON> both began
making key decisions.
   ``Any aircraft can only have one captain, and we had two: <PERSON>Ben
Abruzzo</PERSON> and <PERSON>Maxie Anderson</PERSON>,'' he said.
   But <PERSON>Newman</PERSON> said conflicts were overshadowed by the hardships of
the flight in the 12-by-6-foot living space crowded with TV cameras
and navigational equipment. Newman's hang glider dangled beneath
the gondola and 5,500 pounds of sand and lead for ballast hung over
the sides in bags.
   ``There were many times the flight was in question,'' <PERSON>Newman</PERSON>
recalled. ``But how close it came to failure at each moment was
interpreted different by each of us.''
   They lost altitude rapidly at one point when ice chunks crusted
the top of the balloon. They jettisoned valuable ballast. When they
dropped to 4,000 feet the ice melted.
   Later in the flight they dumped more ballast, including an
expensive navigation system that had failed on the second day. They
tossed oxygen bottles, anything they could.
   <PERSON>Newman</PERSON> said that at one point, a bit delirious from the
altitude, he chucked a <MONEY>$4,000</MONEY> radio _ and only later noticed a jar
of peanut butter that weighed as much.
   Plans were for <PERSON>Newman</PERSON> to fly the glider down once they made it
to <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>.
   But 400 miles from <LOCATION>Ireland</LOCATION>, it came down to a choice of dropping
the glider, their last oxygen and food, or a propane tank for a
heater to battle <ORGANIZATION>Abruzzo</ORGANIZATION>'s frostbite. The glider went.
   Radios also failed during the flight, and the men had to
communicate by ham radio.
   ``The first guy I talked to wouldn't talk because I didn't have
a license,'' said <PERSON>Newman</PERSON>. ``And he didn't believe I was in a
balloon over the middle of the ocean.''
   Finally, <PERSON>Newman</PERSON> reached an old man confined to a wheelchair in a
home for the elderly somewhere in <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>.
   ``His call sign was `G4JY.' I don't think I'll ever forget
that,'' he said. ``He talked to me until the <DATE>last day</DATE> of the
flight. He was like the Good Shepherd.''
   <PERSON>Newman</PERSON> said the rough times were offset by the excitement.
   A high point, he said, came over <LOCATION>Ireland</LOCATION> when a jumbo jet
relayed a message from the <ORGANIZATION>Smithsonian Institution</ORGANIZATION>. The museum had
asked to display the gondola and balloon in the <ORGANIZATION>National Air</ORGANIZATION> and
Space Museum that houses the Apollo 11 moonship, <ORGANIZATION>Lindbergh's Spirit
of St. Louis</ORGANIZATION> and the <PERSON>Wright</PERSON> brothers' plane.
   In the final few hours the men believed they would make it to
<LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>, where <PERSON>Lindbergh</PERSON> had landed 51 years before after the first
solo trans-Atlantic airplane flight. But over <LOCATION>Evreux</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, they
realized they could not go on.
   The last of the ballast was gone, save for a bottle of
champagne. They were 60 miles west of <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>, 3,107 miles and 137
hours from <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION> where the helium-packed balloon had taken off.
   The swiftly draining balloon envelope carcass and its gondola
settled gently to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> as cheering spectators abandoned their cars
along a nearby highway and rushed to the balloon.
   Hundreds tried to take a piece of history.
   ``It's hard to chew rubberized cloth,'' <PERSON>Newman</PERSON> said. ``People
were trying to tear little shreds off, but I think they were
probably losing their teeth more than damaging the balloon.''
   The French press dubbed them the ``new Lindberghs.''
   But <PERSON>Newman</PERSON> says the only time he thought about <PERSON>Lindbergh</PERSON> was
when the adventurers drew straws that evening to see which would
sleep in <LOCATION>Lindbergh</LOCATION>'s bed at the American ambassador's residence in
<LOCATION>France</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Newman</PERSON> and his wife won.
   ``And I ended up on the floor after 30 minutes because I
couldn't sleep,'' he said. ``The bed was like a banana. The springs
were shot.''

   In a cramped gondola dangling beneath
an 11-story helium balloon, with clouds obstructing any view below,
the disembodied voice of the radar operator seemed scarcely to be
believed.
   ``You have crossed the coast of <LOCATION>Ireland</LOCATION>,'' the voice told three
American balloonists on that still-dark early morning 10 years ago.
<PERSON>Larry Newman</PERSON> asked if the message was indeed that which had eluded
others for 105 years.
   Silence.
   Then, crisply, ``Sir, my radar is never wrong.''
   Newman, along with <PERSON>Ben Abruzzo</PERSON> and <PERSON>Maxie Anderson</PERSON>, whooped with
joy. Sunburned and weary after five days aloft, the
businessmen-adventurers had made the first trans-Atlantic crossing
in a balloon.

   Chicago Star to Shine in East

   Chicago -- Within the next month, Denis O'Hare, a slightly
built, well-spoken young man of 30 years, should know whether
he has a future as a word processing temp.
   Word processing is Mr. O'Hare's day job at KPMG Peat
Marwick &amp; Associates here. Until recently, his night job was
playing the title role in the Victory Gardens Theater
production of "Hauptmann" by John Logan. The show played to
rapt audiences and was held over for several months. Mr.
O'Hare's uncertain employment future stems from the transfer
of that production to the Cherry Lane Theatre in New York,
where it is scheduled to begin previews on April 9 prior to
an April 16 opening. Mr. O'Hare, who will go into rehearsals
for the show before the end of the month, is hoping to do
well enough in the Big Apple to give up his days at the
computer keyboard forever.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   I have not seen <PERSON>Mr. O'Hare</PERSON> process words, but his
portrayal of <PERSON>Hauptmann</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> was electrifying. Nor was I
the only critic to gush. <PERSON>Mr. O'Hare</PERSON>'s <PERSON>Hauptmann</PERSON> provoked
singular praise among local critics. His work was described
as "the performance of the year" by the <ORGANIZATION>Chicago Tribune</ORGANIZATION>. The
<ORGANIZATION>Sun-Times</ORGANIZATION> wrote that <PERSON>Mr. O'Hare</PERSON> had accomplished "A tour de
force that could hold its own on any stage in the world."
   "Hauptmann" recounts the sensational prosecution of the
German immigrant <PERSON>Bruno Richard Hauptmann</PERSON> for the kidnapping
of the legendary <PERSON>Lindbergh</PERSON> baby, infant son of the aviation
pioneer <PERSON>Charles</PERSON> ("Lucky Lindy") <PERSON>Lindbergh</PERSON> and the writer <PERSON>Anne
Morrow Lindbergh</PERSON>. <PERSON>Mr. O'Hare</PERSON> portrays the unsavory but not
necessarily guilty <PERSON>Hauptmann</PERSON> with sardonic petulance. As the
play opens, we hear the judge pronounce his guilt and
sentence him to death. What follows is a two-hour impression
of the events surrounding his capture, incarceration and
trial from <PERSON>Hauptmann</PERSON>'s point of view, a view profoundly
affected by his imminent execution.
   <PERSON>Mr. O'Hare</PERSON>'s <PERSON>Hauptmann</PERSON> is no innocent martyred on the
altar of American hero worship. He lies to his captors about
circumstantial evidence linking him to the Lindbergh ransom,
he lies to his wife, and we are never sure when he is lying
to us, the audience. In a transcendent scene, <PERSON>Hauptmann</PERSON>
chillingly recounts a version of the baby's kidnapping and
death. The story he tells recapitulates how the kidnapper may
have gained entry to the second-story Lindbergh nursery in
<ORGANIZATION>Hopewell</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>, snatched the infant, and then accidentally
killed him during the getaway down the ladder.
   <PERSON>Mr. O'Hare</PERSON>'s subtly etched portrayal serves as the frame
within which we view the <PERSON>Lindbergh</PERSON> kidnapping, a classic
American carnival of media excess and unfair, overwrought
legal process. Everybody from President <PERSON>Hoover</PERSON> to <PERSON>Al Capone</PERSON>
pledged to help bring the baby's kidnapper to hard justice.
Everybody was outraged when <PERSON>Hauptmann</PERSON> was apprehended but
failed to confess. We leave the theater without answers
concerning <PERSON>Hauptmann</PERSON>'s guilt or innocence but moved by an
affecting portrayal of a man caught in the vortex of inflamed
national passions.
   Hauptmann is not <PERSON>Mr. O'Hare</PERSON>'s first major role or villain.
He portrayed <PERSON>Nathan Leopold Jr.</PERSON>, an admitted child kidnapper
and killer, in another play by <PERSON>Mr. Logan</PERSON>, "Never the Sinner."
He won an Emmy for his performance as a character based on
<PERSON>Richard Speck</PERSON>, the mass murderer of eight nurses, in the TV
special "Moment of Rage."
   <PERSON>Mr. O'Hare</PERSON> studied acting at <ORGANIZATION>Northwestern University's
School of Speech</ORGANIZATION>. "My acting classes taught me to wear black
turtlenecks and smoke," he recalls. "Acting classes can only
teach you how to perform. Don't get me wrong. I love
performers. <PERSON>Victor Borge</PERSON> does the same thing every time he
performs, and it's terrific. . . . I learned how to be an
actor in my non-acting classes studying literature, music,
poetry and architecture."
   Local success in his craft hasn't spoiled <PERSON>Mr. O'Hare</PERSON>.
O'Hare is a household word, but only as the name of the
city's main airport, and <LOCATION>O'Hare</LOCATION> the actor still has to round
out his income at the computer keyboard. When "Hauptmann"
opened, <PERSON>Mr. O'Hare</PERSON>, as the lead performer, received the
<ORGANIZATION>Actors Equity</ORGANIZATION> minimum rate of <MONEY>$335</MONEY> a week, or an annualized
salary of less than <MONEY>$17,500</MONEY>. When the play was held over, his
weekly wage rose to <MONEY>$550</MONEY>. And that's about the limit he can
hope to earn if his portrayal of <PERSON>Hauptmann</PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION>Cherry Lane</ORGANIZATION>
doesn't command the respect of the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> critics.
   All he really wants from the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> stint is the ability
to make it big in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>. Recognition in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, even
short of rave notices, might make it possible for him to
become a full-time actor based here. "You can't be big in
<LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> until you leave and succeed in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> or
Hollywood," he says. "The big <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> shows cast their leads
on either coast."
   At the moment <PERSON>Mr. O'Hare</PERSON> can compete for a title role at
<ORGANIZATION>Victory Gardens</ORGANIZATION>, but <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>'s major theater companies,
including the Goodman Theater and <LOCATION>Steppenwolf</LOCATION>, look for lead
actors with national reputations. So last year, <PERSON>Mr. O'Hare</PERSON>
took the bit part of <PERSON>Willie Oban</PERSON> in <PERSON>Eugene O'Neill</PERSON>'s "The
Iceman Cometh," while the title role went to the movie actor
<PERSON>Brian Dennehy</PERSON>.
   Even some of <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>'s smaller companies attempt to ensure
strong box office by booking big names. Recently, the Body
Politic Theatre booked <PERSON>Hope Lange</PERSON> for its production of
"Homeward Bound." (She backed out just before rehearsals
began.) The Organic Theatre brought <PERSON>George</PERSON> ("Cheers") <PERSON>Wendt</PERSON>
back here for a revival of "Bleacher Bums."
   In the end it may not matter if <PERSON>Mr. O'Hare</PERSON> comes home from
<LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> wrapped in glory. He invested the raise he got for
"Hauptmann" in bulbs for the garden behind his house in the
modest <LOCATION>Logan Square</LOCATION> neighborhood. "If I can't support myself
as an actor," he says, "I'm going to give up word processing
and become a gardener."

<HEAD>Police Baffled By Discovery Of Head on Golf Course</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A grisly find on a country golf course has
police culling clues from around the nation, but so far detectives
are baffled about the identity of a woman whose head was discovered
lying along a brook.
   Police say they may have to use the lastest technology of modern
forensics to determine the victim's identity.
   ``We have nothing concrete,'' said <ORGANIZATION>Hopewell Township Police</ORGANIZATION> Lt.
<PERSON>Michael Chipowski</PERSON>. ``We've gotten dozens of calls about people who
haven't been seen for a while, but they haven't led anywhere.''
   Chipowski said the case has recently drawn more than 200 leads
and inquiries from across the nation.
   ``Probably nothing has stirred up such excitement here since the
<PERSON>Lindbergh</PERSON> case,'' <PERSON>Chipowski</PERSON> said, referring to the trial of <PERSON>Bruno
Hauptmann</PERSON>, who was convicted in a nearby courthouse of murdering
flying ace <PERSON>Charles Lindbergh</PERSON>'s baby son <DATE>a half century ago</DATE>.
   ``This is certainly out of the ordinary. It's a real mystery,''
he said.
   The female human head was discovered <DATE>March 5</DATE> by a golfer whose
errant shot sent him searching for his ball along the bank of a
brook at the <ORGANIZATION>Hopewell Valley Golf Club</ORGANIZATION> north of <LOCATION>Trenton</LOCATION>. Chipowski
said police believe the killing occurred just before the discovery
because there was fresh makeup on the head and ``the features were
in a good state.''
   ``We have about 30 leads yet to complete,'' said <PERSON>Chipowski</PERSON>.
``We'll run down every one of them.''

<DESCRIPT>  BOOK; REVIEW  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  IT WAS called the Crime of the Century even when the century was young, and
nearly 60 years later it still is. The 1932 kidnapping and subsequent death of
Charles and Anne Lindbergh's infant son from his second-floor nursery in New
Jersey had suspense, an innocent child victim, a fortune in lost ransom and a
fabulous cast of celebrity characters -- suspects, investigators, psychics,
opportunists.;    And conspiracy theories. Bruno Richard Hauptmann was
executed for the crime, but the Lindbergh case was marked by bad police work,
squabbling public agencies, personal ambition and greed. If Hauptmann was
innocent -- and the case against him was certainly flawed -- then it would
seem that almost anyone in America could have kidnapped Charles Lindbergh Jr.  </LEADPARA>

(<ORGANIZATION>Bantam Books</ORGANIZATION>, 516 pp., <MONEY>$22.50</MONEY>), is surely his finest hour.;    <PERSON>Heller</PERSON> is the
youngest plainclothesman on the <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> police force, and in the early days
after the kidnapping, when <PERSON>Al Capone</PERSON> is still a suspect, <PERSON>Heller</PERSON> is sent off to
be <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>'s liaison with the <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> state cops.;    The case is a mess.
The Jersey cops have botched the fingerprinting and crime-scene investigation,
and they are not reporting to law enforcement officials, but to <PERSON>Lindy</PERSON> himself,
who knows a lot about aviation but nothing about police work. He considers his
servants above reproach, for example, and does not allow them to be
interrogated, despite evidence that there is an inside connection in the
kidnapping. Whenever there is a lead, <PERSON>Lindy</PERSON> keeps the cops on a leash; he
wants to pay the ransom and get his son back.;    <ORGANIZATION>Heller</ORGANIZATION> sees that Slim -- as
<PERSON>Lindbergh</PERSON>'s friends call him -- can't win. He's trying to play by the rules in
a game run by cheaters.;    <ORGANIZATION>Heller</ORGANIZATION> is a likable gumshoe who reminds me of
<PERSON>Archie Goodwin</PERSON>, sidekick to <PERSON>Rex Stout</PERSON>'s formidable <PERSON>Nero Wolfe</PERSON>. He's roughly
honest but no prig, smart but no genius, a great drinking partner and a
capable adversary. Of course, <PERSON>Goodwin</PERSON> had the genius <PERSON>Wolfe</PERSON> behind him. Heller
isn't so lucky.;    Working awkwardly with the inept police and with
interested <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> heiress <PERSON>Evalyn Walsh McLean</PERSON> -- a hot number, if there
ever was one -- <PERSON>Heller</PERSON> confronts a Gordian knot of clues and false leads.
There are three strings of suspects he can dismiss as crackpots or schemers,
except that each of these groups has some piece of information that only the
kidnapper could have. When <PERSON>Heller</PERSON> draws together a theory that explains
everything, a fellow investigator scoffs that things are becoming too
Byzantine. Heller replies, "If you'd care to point out any one part of this
case that has ever made rational sense, I'll slip on my raincoat and go home.
Right now.";    <ORGANIZATION>Heller</ORGANIZATION>'s theory is cockeyed, as it turns out. But it's close
enough to trigger one last brilliant and astonishing revelation, a solution
that brings the book full circle and resonates right into the 1990s.;   
"Stolen Away" is a great suspense novel, backed by considerable research and
stylishly told in the fast, slangy style of the jazz age. Heller gets beat up
too often to be in the top rank of detectives, but <PERSON>Collins</PERSON> is certainly among
the elite of his craft.;  WESTERN CIVILIZATION: <PERSON>Douglas C. Jones</PERSON>' "The Search
for Temperance Moon" (<ORGANIZATION>Henry Holt</ORGANIZATION>, 324 pp., <MONEY>$22.50</MONEY>) is a rich elegy to
tumultuous <LOCATION>Fort Smith</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ark.</LOCATION>, as its chapter of the Old West came to a fitful,
violent close at the end of the <DATE>19th century.</DATE>;    <PERSON>Fort Smith</PERSON>, home of <PERSON>Isaac
Parker</PERSON>, the legendary "Hanging Judge," was the gateway to the <ORGANIZATION>Indian Nations</ORGANIZATION>,
the home in exile of the so-called Five Civilized Tribes -- Cherokee, <LOCATION>Creek</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Choctaw</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Chickasaw</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Seminole</LOCATION>. Civilized they may have been, in the dubious
sense that they had long been influenced by white ways, but the <ORGANIZATION>Nations</ORGANIZATION> were
far from civil. There was probably no more lawless place on earth.;    As
Jones writes of one character:;    Never having had the advantage of an
education at such places as <PERSON>Mrs. Sawyer</PERSON>'s Female Seminary in <LOCATION>Fayetteville</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Winona</LOCATION> had learned the white man's talk from almost thirty years of
association with bootleggers, horse thieves, railroad roustabouts, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>
cattle drovers, land speculators, Baptist evangelists, pimps, bank robbers,
and murderers. In short . . . she was a true daughter of the old Indian
Territory.;    If <PERSON>Winona Crowfoot</PERSON> is the corrupted, <PERSON>Temperance Moon</PERSON> is the
corrupt. Known as the Bandit Queen of the Indian Territory, <LOCATION>Temperance</LOCATION> --
daughter of a Protestant minister -- numbers a handful of true desperadoes
among her successive husbands. From one she's taken her last name and from
another a farm in <ORGANIZATION>Creek Nation</ORGANIZATION> that serves as a general headquarters for the
region's drunks, thieves and killers.;    Then <PERSON>Temperance Moon</PERSON> gets her head
shot off, and the likeliest suspect is found dead soon after. The <ORGANIZATION>U.S.
Marshal</ORGANIZATION>'s office closes the case, but <PERSON>Jewel Moon</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Temperance</ORGANIZATION>'s daughter and
the proprietor of a whorehouse, pays former deputy <PERSON>Oscar Schiller</PERSON> in
greenbacks and cocaine to find out who killed her mother -- and why.;     As
Oscar and his hand-picked partners peel away the layers of guilt and sin,
Arkansan Jones paints an unforgettable picture of a colorful place and time.
His fine prose is never hurried, and, though the violence comes seldom and
suddenly, the air is ever heavy with menace.;    I've always liked <PERSON>Jones</PERSON>'
Westerns, but this is his best. That means it's as good as they get.;  THE
TRAGI-COMICS: Starfire, the comic-strip creation that is central in <LOCATION>San
Franciscan</LOCATION> <PERSON>Mary-Rose Hayes</PERSON>' romantic "Paper Star" (<PERSON>E.P. Dutton</PERSON>, 359 pp.,
<MONEY>$19.95</MONEY>), is an extra-terrestrial environmental superhero -- a little close
conceptually to <ORGANIZATION>Turner Broadcasting Systems</ORGANIZATION>' <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME> "Captain
Planet.";    A project to bring the sci-fi heroine alive in the movies unites
four friends: <PERSON>Vera Brown</PERSON>, the sometimes-obese creator of Starfire; "Saint"
(That's <PERSON>Sloane St. John Treadwell Jr.</PERSON>), who scripts the strip; Jo-Beth "J.B."
<PERSON>Feeney</PERSON>, tormented actress/model who is the inspiration and screen incarnation
of Starfire; and <PERSON>Arnie Blaize</PERSON>, a matinee idol who has sought in drugs relief
from his yearning for an identity. The four, all emotionally needy, fall into
the web of <PERSON>Victor Diamond</PERSON>, influential Hollywood producer, insidious
manipulator and -- just possibly -- Saint's father.;    I like these
characters. Vera, in particular, is vital and real, and refreshingly different
from the cookie-cutter heroines of much romantic fiction.;    But ultimately,
this book stands or falls with Starfire, the comic-strip creation. And <PERSON>Hayes</PERSON>
doesn't quite bring her off.;    When Saint and <LOCATION>J.B.</LOCATION> first see Vera's
pre-professional strips, they are convulsed with laughter, which doesn't seem
the right response to this kind of strip at all. Hours later, they part, and
Vera, initiating a three-way hug, says, "The Starfire Trio, right? Through
thick and thin." Now, considering that Saint and <PERSON>J.B.</PERSON> have only just heard of
Starfire, and that they happen to be up to their eyeballs in one fresh killing
and an old one, the cartoon character is an unlikely bonding agent.;    All
through "Paper Star," <PERSON>Hayes</PERSON> wants us to embrace Starfire as more than we can.
It's a shame, because the "real" people here, and much of the story, are
compelling.;  ' "Can you scare them, men like that?";    "When you put a gun
in their mouth, you can.";    "But would the police do that?";    "Evalyn, I
am the police." ';    -- From "Stolen Away"; by <PERSON>Max Allan Collins</PERSON>;  ' That was
the only conversation as they ate. And <PERSON>Tishacomsie</PERSON> took the food to her mouth
with delicate fingers as surely as did the men, without reserve, without any
thought that she was different from them, and all the while her dark gaze
fastened on <PERSON>Oscar Schiller</PERSON>'s face like a cat looking at a caged bird. In fact,
both Indians sized up the white man, and <PERSON>Oscar Schiller</PERSON> reciprocated in kind.
With intense curiosity on both sides to ensure that everything was as it had
been in the past, that there was still trust between them. '; -- From "The
Search for Temperance Moon"; by <PERSON>Douglas C. Jones</PERSON>;  ' Now Saint stared
longingly at the bright porthole that might be hers and wished he could go
there and be held in her arms and be comforted and strengthened. He wanted to
lay his head on her breast and cry: This is a bad man, <PERSON>Vera</PERSON>, he's dangerous
and cruel and evil, I'm totally indebted to him -- and I think he might be my
father. What am I going to do? '; -- From "Paper Star"; by <PERSON>Mary-Rose Hayes</PERSON>  </TEXT>

<DESCRIPT>  LOCAL; POLITIC; BRIEF  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  While the trains aren't likely to role before the next century, a classic
political battle is building this spring over the planned route of BART to San
Jose. Two of the chief protagonists are rivals on the board of supervisors,
Ron Gonzales and Zoe Lofgren. And with a set of public hearings scheduled this
month, the stakes are suddenly much bigger than ever before. Some of the smart
money says BART will follow the Southern Pacific route favored by Lofgren.
That means the trains will run south along Interstate 880, stop near the
Mercury News, and then tunnel underneath Fifth, Eighth or Tenth streets into
downtown. A key stop on this line would be at Japantown, which is of
considerable interest to the well-heeled investors in the Nihonmachi
development.;    You may remember, however, that Gonzales is pushing a route
along the Union Pacific tracks, which parallel Lundy Avenue. three miles to
the east. Gonzales has argued that this would benefit many more east San
Joseans. Transportation planners now have completed a study showing that the
Gonzales alternative would cost $280 million more and produce only 640 more
daily riders. But Gonzales aide Jude Barry told us that those numbers -- based
on one more station than needed -- overstate the difference. ""We don't feel
the UP route is unrealistically more expensive," said Barry. FYI: The Southern
Pacific route would spare the home of Lofgren. The Gonzales alternative --
which now involves a deep tunnel -- would pass within a block of her house on
South 14th Street.  </LEADPARA>

<MEMO>  The Insider  </MEMO>
<TEXT>  A VOTRE SAINTE;    With the departure of Mayor <PERSON>Tom McEnery</PERSON> and his Irish
roots, the new foreign passion at <LOCATION>San Jose City Hall</LOCATION> is <LOCATION>Normandy</LOCATION>. Our
columnist <PERSON>Leigh Weimers</PERSON> reported last <DATE>Friday</DATE> that a contingent of city
officials led by Vice Mayor <PERSON>Pat Sausedo</PERSON> will leave for <LOCATION>Normandy</LOCATION> on a junket in
<DATE>March</DATE>. And <LOCATION>Normandy</LOCATION> will be the theme of this year's <ORGANIZATION>Silicon Valley Charity
Ball</ORGANIZATION>, which will be attended by a host of French officials. Among those
pursuing this new relationship is the the city's director of economic
development, <PERSON>Bill Claggett</PERSON>, who will be on the <DATE>March</DATE> tour. What isn't so
widely known is that <PERSON>Claggett</PERSON>'s wife, Sunny, has been a paid cultural
consultant for <LOCATION>Normandy</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Silicon Valley</LOCATION>. Sunny <PERSON>Claggett</PERSON> told us she has been
a liaison with the <ORGANIZATION>Charity Ball</ORGANIZATION> and has helped to set up an exhibition of
French art. She contended, however, that she and her husband keep their
interests separate. "We're very much attentive to that," she said. "I'm only
doing the cultural stuff, helping them put together parties." A postscript: A
few prominent local business leaders have been grumbling that the city hasn't
emphasized exports enough in establishing relationships with countries that
want <LOCATION>Silicon Valley jobs.</LOCATION>; A WICKED STORY; Some of you may have followed Gov.
<PERSON>Pete Wilson</PERSON>'s let-them-drink-cake statement last month. Defending his plan to
slash welfare payments, <PERSON>Wilson</PERSON> said: "I'm convinced they'll be able to pay the
rent. They will have less for a six-pack of beer. I don't begrudge them the
six-pack of beer, but it's not an urgent necessity." While this has generally
escaped scrutiny because of the <LOCATION>Persian Gulf</LOCATION> war, the timing of this
declaration was curious: It came only days after the <PERSON>Wilson</PERSON> administration
designated its own "official inauguration brew": <PERSON>Pete</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>Wicked Ale</ORGANIZATION>, made by
<ORGANIZATION>Pete's Brewing Co.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Palo Alto</LOCATION>. Is the <PERSON>Wilson</PERSON> administration, uh, swilling
out of both sides of the mouth? Maybe not. Most welfare recipients won't be
able to afford <PERSON>Pete</PERSON>'s. Its amber-colored <ORGANIZATION>Wicked Ale</ORGANIZATION> sells for <MONEY>$5.99</MONEY> a
six-pack, a wickedly Republican price.; HISTORY LESSON; Everyone following the
war in the <LOCATION>Middle East</LOCATION> by now has an impression of Gen. <PERSON>H. Norman Schwarzkopf</PERSON>,
the American commander known as "Stormin' Norman." What isn't so widely known
are some of the ironies in his family history. <PERSON>Schwarzkopf</PERSON>'s father, also <PERSON>H.
Norman Schwarzkopf</PERSON>, was the commander of the <ORGANIZATION>New Jersey State Police</ORGANIZATION> and the
prime investigator in the kidnapping of the <LOCATION>Lindbergh</LOCATION> baby in <DATE>1932</DATE>. <PERSON>Charles
Lindbergh</PERSON>, you may remember, was one of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s major isolationists before
World War II (although what he would think about the Iraqi war is only a
guess).;    In any case, the details of the <PERSON>Lindbergh</PERSON> case make fascinating
reading today. When police found what they believed to be the body of the
<PERSON>Lindbergh</PERSON> baby in a patch of woods, <PERSON>Schwarzkopf</PERSON> pere was every bit as
meticulously prepared as his son today. He issued a formal brief to the press.
And he had emergency phone lines laid to within 75 feet of the site as he
pursued what he called a "gang" that did the kidnapping. In <DATE>February, 1935</DATE>, a
few months after <PERSON>Schwarzkopf</PERSON>'s son was born, <PERSON>Bruno Richard Hauptmann</PERSON> was
convicted of the murder. (box)  </TEXT>

former days. What is the worth of all this? The only guide to a man
is his conscience; the only shield to his memory is the rectitude
and sincerity of his actions.'' _ <ORGANIZATION>Winston Churchill</ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>San Diegans Seek Alternative to Cramped Lindbergh Field</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DENNIS GEORGATOS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A cramped and nerve-wracking airport and no
room to build a new one has <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> in a tight spot.
   It's hard to imagine a more picturesque setting for an
international airport _ on a bayfront flanked by rolling hills,
glassy skyscrapers and the gray magnificence of a <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> fleet.
   But to pilots who are forced by downtown buildings to descend
steeply on approach to <LOCATION>Lindbergh Field</LOCATION>, the setting for the airport
serving the nation's sixth largest city is all wrong.
   ``It's the worst airport in the world,'' said <PERSON>Tom Carroll</PERSON> of the
<ORGANIZATION>Air Line Pilots Association</ORGANIZATION>.
   Some would call than an exaggeration, but a <DATE>1988</DATE> survey of 1,360
pilots found <ORGANIZATION>Lindbergh Field</ORGANIZATION> tied in fith place with <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION>'s
<LOCATION>Singleton Airport</LOCATION> as the least safe airport in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>.
   Transportation planners and civic leaders, who eye the land that
<PERSON>Lindbergh</PERSON> sits on for downtown expansion, have spent 30 years
searching for a replacement. The most frequently discussed option
is to convert the <LOCATION>Miramar Naval Air Station</LOCATION> to a commercial or
joint-use airport.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> is adamantly opposed to any such plan.
   Unless an alternative is found by the turn of the century,
<LOCATION>Lindbergh</LOCATION>, built in <DATE>1928</DATE>, could throw a wrench into the region's
robust economy.
   ``<LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> is running into an economic buzz saw if we wait any
longer,'' said <PERSON>Dan Pegg</PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION>San Diego Economic
Development Corp</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``It's absolutely the toughest issue in <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON>Jack
Koerper</PERSON>, the director of special projects for the <ORGANIZATION>San Diego
Association of Governments</ORGANIZATION>, the regional planning agency conducting
the airport search.
   Squeezed onto 485 acres, <LOCATION>Lindbergh</LOCATION> is surrounded by <LOCATION>San Diego
Bay</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Marine Corps Recruit Depot</ORGANIZATION>, businesses, residential areas
and rolling hills.
   ``One pilot likened it to landing in a shoebox,'' said <PERSON>Dick
Russell</PERSON> of the pilots association.
   ``I cannot and will not say it's unsafe, but I will say a pilot
flying into <PERSON>Lindbergh</PERSON> has to be on the ball at all times. There's
very little room for error,'' he said.
   Lindbergh handled 11 million people <DATE>last year</DATE>, but planners say
its saturation point may come in five to 10 years, the time to make
another airport operational. A new airport would have to serve
about 40 million passengers by <DATE>2050</DATE>, aviation planners and civic
leaders say.
   Despite some 40 studies since <DATE>1960</DATE>, no consensus has developed
on an alternative to <LOCATION>Lindbergh</LOCATION>.
   One proposal called for a binational airport on Otay <LOCATION>Mesa</LOCATION>, at
the Mexican border, but that would require the negotiation of
international agreements with <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>.
   Other possibilities include a ``hub-and-spoke'' concept in which
a main airport would be constructed in <LOCATION>Imperial Valley</LOCATION>, some 100
miles to the east, with travelers shuttled to <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> on smaller
planes or a high-speed train.
   An offshore, or ``floating'' airport also has been discussed.
   Around <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>, options have dwindled as urban sprawl gobbled
undeveloped land.
   ``The only place that development hasn't preempted is <LOCATION>Miramar</LOCATION>
and that's because the <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> has preserved it,'' said county
supervisor <PERSON>Brian Bilbray</PERSON>.
   But the cost of replacing the air base, home to the ``Top Gun''
pilot school, would be <MONEY>$10 billion</MONEY>, said <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON>Bill Lowery</PERSON>,
<LOCATION>R-San Diego</LOCATION>.
   ``<LOCATION>Miramar</LOCATION> is not an option,'' said <PERSON>Lowery</PERSON>. ``The <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION>'s not just
said `no.' They've said, `Hell, no.' ''

   <ORGANIZATION>Adela Rogers St. Johns</ORGANIZATION>, one of
journalism's avowed ``sob sisters'' who was a friend of former
President <PERSON>Nixon</PERSON> and newspaper magnate <PERSON>William Randolph Hearst</PERSON>, died
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE>. She was 94.
   <PERSON>Mrs. St. Johns</PERSON>, whose reporting career spanned nearly 60 years
and included such major stories as the Lindbergh kidnapping, had
been hospitalized at the <ORGANIZATION>South County Convalescent Hospital</ORGANIZATION>.
   An ardent feminist and a pioneer in her field, <PERSON>Mrs. St. Johns</PERSON>
once wrote: ``I wish women would stand together and shackle the men
who want to move us backwards.''
   <ORGANIZATION>Hearst</ORGANIZATION> hired her as a cub reporter at the <LOCATION>San Francisco Examiner</LOCATION>
for <MONEY>$7</MONEY> a week in <DATE>1913</DATE>, a time when there were few women in the
newsroom.
   The following year, she transferred to the <ORGANIZATION>Los Angeles Herald
Examiner</ORGANIZATION>, another <ORGANIZATION>Hearst</ORGANIZATION> newspaper, and later worked for the
<ORGANIZATION>International News Service</ORGANIZATION>. ``She was a kind of wild, uninhibited
woman before feminism came in,'' said <PERSON>Mel Durslag</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Los Angeles
Herald Examiner</ORGANIZATION> sports columnist and 50-year <ORGANIZATION>Hearst</ORGANIZATION> veteran. ``She
was a tough, hard newspaper woman, one of the guys. She was a
figure from the old roaring days of <ORGANIZATION>Hearst</ORGANIZATION> journalism, which no
longer lives.''
   She covered the ``trial of the century'' of <PERSON>Bruno Richard
Hauptmann</PERSON>, charged in the kidnapping and murder of aviator <PERSON>Charles
A. Lindbergh</PERSON>'s infant son. When <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Edward VIII</PERSON> abdicated,
she was assigned the story. Later, she covered the assassination of
<LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION> political boss <PERSON>Huey Long</PERSON> and the trial of <PERSON>Patty Hearst</PERSON>,
the publisher's granddaughter.
   She was an avowed ``sob sister,'' saying at one time, ``Unless
you move the heart of the country, you will never get it moving.''
   In <DATE>1962</DATE>, she published ``Final Verdict,'' about her father,
renowned criminal lawyer <PERSON>Earl Rogers</PERSON>, but perhaps her best-received
book was ``The Honeycomb,'' an autobiography published in <DATE>1969</DATE>.
   In <DATE>1924</DATE>, she married <PERSON>William Ivan</PERSON> ``Ike'' <PERSON>St. Johns</PERSON>, the
<ORGANIZATION>Herald</ORGANIZATION>'s chief copy editor. They were divorced, and she remarried
twice, with both those marriages also ending in divorce. She had
three children from her marriages.
   <PERSON>Mrs. St. Johns</PERSON> was a longtime friend of former President <PERSON>Nixon</PERSON>,
who in <DATE>1970</DATE> honored her as the only woman among eight journalists
awarded the Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor.
   The award cited her for ``exceptional ability to reveal the
human story behind the news.''

<TEXT>
   <PERSON>Charles Lindbergh</PERSON>'s historic words were, "I made it." 
<PERSON>Neil Armstrong</PERSON> uttered the neatly crafted "one small step" lines. 
<PERSON>Dick Rutan</PERSON>, at touchdown yesterday after his and <PERSON>Jeana Yeager</PERSON>'s nine-day, nonstop, non-refueled circumnavigation of the globe, simply said, "Miller time." 

   Those words are a part of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s popular culture. 
So are individualistic feats of daring and creative enterprise. 
Being reminded of that after enduring several weeks of nonstop and often self-demeaning acrimony from the nation's capital is the nicest Christmas present we can imagine. 

   The admen who compose beer commercials usually are in closer touch with our culture than more elevated thinkers. 
Creative and constructive work well done earns a time to relax. 
When Voyager alighted on the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> desert after an incredible feat of aircraft design and human endurance, we, at least, needed no further refreshment. 

   "Not bad for three people, eh?" asked <PERSON>Dick Rutan</PERSON> pointedly when a congressman thrust himself forward to welcome the fliers back. 
The congressman, whose name we didn't catch, obviously meant well but seemed out of place in that bright Mojave desert world of <PERSON>Burt Rutan</PERSON>, who had designed and built a beautiful and unique airplane, and of <PERSON>Dick Rutan</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jeana Yeager</PERSON>, who had just flown it around the world. 

   A reporter wanted to know why the Rutans and <PERSON>Ms. Yeager</PERSON> undertook this adventure. 
The answer, which demands reflection, was that they were sure it could be done and wanted to experience "the event," the accomplishment of something never before achieved. 
Lindbergh would have understood. 
So would any artist who ever found self-expression in putting paint on canvas or musical notes on a staff. 

   <PERSON>Burt Rutan</PERSON>'s artistry is airplanes. 
Someone has called him an "aerospace hacker," a term of high praise that equates him with computer hackers and all the other tinkerers whose imaginations have yielded up our modern inventions. 
Rutan planes are things of beauty -- lightweight creations using <ORGANIZATION>Hexcel</ORGANIZATION> fiber-reinforced composites and honeycomb for strength plus little "canard" wings up front for extra lift and stability. 
His speciality is putting together experimental, one-of-a-kind, small-scale prototypes to test out new designs for builders of private and military aircraft. 
The Voyager, with its incredible capacity to lift 9.5 times its own weight (which enabled it to carry enough fuel for its global flight), was the ultimate expression of his art. 
A fuel-efficient, liquid-cooled <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> engine and a new long-lasting synthetic motor oil from <ORGANIZATION>Mobil</ORGANIZATION> contributed to the 'round-the-world feat. 

   <PERSON>Burt Rutan</PERSON> has not escaped <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s constraints on enterprise. 
He at one time marketed <MONEY>$100</MONEY> and <MONEY>$200</MONEY> instruction kits for would-be builders of home-made airplanes. 
As with so many small-business men these days, he ran into the liability crisis. 
A customer neglected a few steps, particularly the use of bolts as well as glue to hold the wings on his craft. 
He crashed and sued. 
<PERSON>Mr. Rutan</PERSON> won his case, but spent <MONEY>$10,000</MONEY> in legal fees, an experience that persuaded him to move into non-retail endeavors. 

   There is irony in the fact that someone thought it necessary to put a counter on the Voyager landing gear to be checked by a <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautic Association</ORGANIZATION> official after the landing, so there could never be any suspicion that <PERSON>Dick</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jeana</PERSON> stopped somewhere for refueling during their flight. 
The <ORGANIZATION>NAA</ORGANIZATION>, a private group that certifies aircraft competitions and record-setting flights, was only doing its job, but we never entirely escape the lawyer culture. 

   We escaped it sufficiently, however. 
<PERSON>Dick Rutan</PERSON> in his cowboy hat and <PERSON>Jeana Yeager</PERSON> in her flight suit, perched on top of Voyager to stretch their legs after 25,012 bumpy and at times harrowing miles, were symbols of that escape yesterday. 
Their safe return brings us a full measure of Christmas joy.

   Douglas ``Wrong Way''
<PERSON>Corrigan</PERSON>, going the right way this time, returned <DATE>Monday</DATE> to the
airfield where he landed his small plane 50 years ago after leaving
<LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> on a flight to <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>.
   ``Look, no hands!'' the 81-year-old American declared, arms
aloft in a triumphant gesture, as the commuter plane carrying him
from <LOCATION>Dublin</LOCATION> landed at <LOCATION>Baldonnel Airport</LOCATION>. Corrigan wore the same
leather flying jacket he had on when he landed here the first time.
   An army band, a Cabinet minister and the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> ambassador greeted
him, along with <PERSON>R.W. Sullivan</PERSON>, the aircraft engineer who met him on
the first trip.
   He came to <LOCATION>Ireland</LOCATION> by commercial jet for festivities celebrating
his famous wrong-way flight, then joined the pilot in the cockpit
of a propeller plane renamed WW2 _ or Wrong Way 2 _ for the
10-minute flight to <LOCATION>Baldonnel</LOCATION>.
   Corrigan has always said he misread his compass, headed east by
mistake, and did not know until his <MONEY>$900</MONEY> Curtiss-Robin monoplane
pierced the clouds 28 hours later that he was over <LOCATION>Ireland</LOCATION>. He had
applied to fly the <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION>, but was refused because the plane,
carrying 330 gallons of gasoline and five gallons of oil, was
deemed too heavy to be safe over the ocean.
   Before leaving the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> for his first trip to <LOCATION>Ireland</LOCATION>
since, the Texas-born pilot hinted his story might change, but he
stuck to it at the initial ceremony.
   ``I followed the wrong end of the compass needle,'' he told
admirers at <LOCATION>Baldonnel Airport</LOCATION>. ``It's a simple thing to happen. It
shouldn't have happened. I was the first one to admit that I had
made a mistake and I was willing to correct it.''
   He recalled that the the runway at <LOCATION>Baldonnel</LOCATION>, now Irish air
force headquarters, was a grass strip the last time he landed there.
   ``I taxied up to a little shack where there were two men in
uniform,'' <PERSON>Corrigan</PERSON> said. ``I was in trouble until they found out
what my name was and the policeman said, `He's just another
Irishman coming home.'''
   <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Ambassador <PERSON>Margaret Heckler</PERSON> said <DATE>Monday</DATE>: ``I'm so proud of
you. You are amazing.''
   <PERSON>Corrigan</PERSON> said he had never really been in <LOCATION>Ireland</LOCATION> before because
he had no passport or other papers the first time he arrived.
``This time I'm in <LOCATION>Ireland</LOCATION> and I have the papers to prove it,'' he
said.
   Also present were Transport Minister <PERSON>John Wilson</PERSON>; <PERSON>Alice Glenn</PERSON>,
deputy lord mayor of <LOCATION>Dublin</LOCATION>, and <PERSON>David Kennedy</PERSON>, chief executive of
the national airline <ORGANIZATION>Aer Lingus</ORGANIZATION>, who wished ``a hearty cead mile
failte _ 100,000 welcomes _ to <PERSON>Mr. Douglas</PERSON> `Wrong Way' <PERSON>Corrigan</PERSON>.''
   Wilson congratulated the sprightly American on still being able
to fit into his <DATE>1938</DATE> flying jacket and said he hoped <PERSON>Corrigan</PERSON>'s
plane, now partly dismantled at his home in <LOCATION>Santa Ana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>,
might one day return to <LOCATION>Ireland</LOCATION> for exhibit.
   When <PERSON>Corrigan</PERSON> landed in <LOCATION>Ireland</LOCATION> on <DATE>July 18, 1938</DATE>, after a flight
that was supposed to take him to <LOCATION>Long Beach</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, he had only <MONEY>$3</MONEY>
in his pocket and knew no one, he said in an interview <DATE>Sunday</DATE>
before departing from <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>.
   This time, accompanied by his son, <PERSON>Harry</PERSON>, and daughter-in-law,
<LOCATION>Charlotte</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Corrigan</PERSON> crossed the <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> in six hours as an honored
guest of <ORGANIZATION>Aer Lingus</ORGANIZATION> in a <ORGANIZATION>Boeing</ORGANIZATION> 747. The airline plans three days
of ceremonies for him.
   <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> aviation authorities suspended <PERSON>Corrigan</PERSON> from flying for
five days after he his unauthorized trip to <LOCATION>Dublin</LOCATION>, but Americans
and the Irish loved his explanation.
   The results in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> were a <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> ticker-tape
parade, a meeting with President <PERSON>Franklin D. Roosevelt</PERSON> and a movie,
``The Flying Irishman,'' starring <PERSON>Corrigan</PERSON> as himself.
   He was a woodworker and took up aviation when he helped build
the Spirit of <LOCATION>St. Louis</LOCATION>, in which <PERSON>Charles Lindbergh</PERSON> made the first
solo flight across the <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> in <DATE>1927</DATE>.
   Corrigan bought his own plane for <MONEY>$310</MONEY> in <DATE>1931</DATE> and spent <MONEY>$590</MONEY>
modifying it for the trip.

<TEXT>
   Douglas ``Wrong Way'' <PERSON>Corrigan</PERSON> returned
here today for ceremonies commemorating his famous wrong turn 50
years ago that led him to fly thousands of miles east instead of
west, to <LOCATION>Ireland</LOCATION> instead of <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>.
   ``Look, no hands,'' the 81-year-old American declared, hands
aloft in a triumphant gesture, as the <ORGANIZATION>Aer Lingus</ORGANIZATION> plane carrying him
from <LOCATION>Dublin</LOCATION> landed at <LOCATION>Baldonnel Airport</LOCATION> after a 10-minute flight.
   First to greet him at <LOCATION>Baldonnel</LOCATION>, now Irish air force
headquarters, was <PERSON>R.W. O'Sullivan</PERSON>, the aviation engineer who met
him the first time he landed in <LOCATION>Dublin</LOCATION>, in <DATE>1938</DATE>.
   <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Ambassador <PERSON>Margaret Heckler</PERSON> told the aviator: ``I'm so
proud of you. You are amazing.''
   Corrigan's first transatlantic hop as pilot of a <MONEY>$900</MONEY> monoplane
was forbidden by <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> officials, who said his plane wasn't safe. He
said he would fly back to <LOCATION>Long Beach</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, but somehow he landed
in <LOCATION>Ireland</LOCATION> anyhow.
   This time, <PERSON>Corrigan</PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION>Ireland</LOCATION> by commercial jet for
festivities celebrating his famed wrong-way flight, then boarded
the Shorts-360 propellor plane, renamed WW2 (for ``wrong way'') in
his honor, and flew to <LOCATION>Baldonnel</LOCATION> in the cockpit.
   He sported the same leather flying jacket he wore on his first
flight.
   Corrigan flew from <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> as an honored passenger of <ORGANIZATION>Aer
Lingus</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Irish Airline</ORGANIZATION>, on a <ORGANIZATION>Boeing</ORGANIZATION> 747. He wouldn't say in an
interview before his dekparture from <LOCATION>Kennedy International Airport</LOCATION>
<DATE>Sunday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> if the true story of what happened 50 years ago might
come out during his visit to <LOCATION>Ireland</LOCATION>.
   But <PERSON>Corrigan</PERSON>, of <LOCATION>Santa Ana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calf.</LOCATION>, hinted recently that his
``wrong-way'' explanation may change after he arrives in <LOCATION>Dublin</LOCATION>.
Nevertheless, he stuck to his story during the initial ceremony
today.
   Before his departure, <PERSON>Corrigan</PERSON> was whisked in a <ORGANIZATION>New York Police
Department</ORGANIZATION> helicopter to the <LOCATION>Brooklyn</LOCATION> airfield for a nostalgic
visit.
   ``It looks a little different than it did 50 years ago. It's got
more buildings scattered around,'' he said. ``But the runway is
still there and the control tower.''
   His <ORGANIZATION>Aer Lingus</ORGANIZATION> flight was delayed for several hours because of
rain in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. When he took off from <ORGANIZATION>Floyd Bennett Field</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Brooklyn</LOCATION> on <DATE>July 17, 1938</DATE>, ``it wasn't raining at all,'' the
81-year-old <PERSON>Corrigan</PERSON> recalled. It took him 28 hours to get to
<LOCATION>Dublin</LOCATION>.
   ``When I saw the water I didn't think it was the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION>, but at
that time I was in the air for 26 hours and when I came down
through the clouds I noticed I had been reading the compass needle
backwards,'' he told Irish state radio.
   ``That was when I first realized I had been going east instead
of west,'' he said.
   Today's flight took about six hours, and <PERSON>Corrigan</PERSON> did not seem
to be suffering from the effects of jet lag when he arrived in
<LOCATION>Ireland</LOCATION> <TIME>this morning</TIME>.
   ``I believe he's in splendid form. We had plans he'd rest for a
while but he really wasn't interested in that,'' said <PERSON>Margaret
Coyne</PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION>Aer Lingus</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman in <LOCATION>Dublin</LOCATION>. Corrigan is staying in
<LOCATION>Dublin</LOCATION> as a guest of <ORGANIZATION>Aer Lingus</ORGANIZATION>, which plans three days of
ceremonies.
   On <DATE>July 18, 1938</DATE>, when he first touched down in <LOCATION>Ireland</LOCATION>, he only
had <MONEY>$3</MONEY> in his pocket and didn't know anyone, <PERSON>Corrigan</PERSON> said.
   On his arrival in <LOCATION>Dublin</LOCATION> <DATE>a half century ago</DATE>, <PERSON>Corrigan</PERSON> claimed,
``My compass froze. I guess I flew the wrong way.''
   He has steadfastly maintained he thought he was returning to his
home base of <LOCATION>Long Beach</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, after federal aviation authorities
said his used Curtiss-Robin monoplane was too heavy for a safe
flight to <LOCATION>Ireland</LOCATION>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Bureau of Air Commerce</ORGANIZATION>, forerunner of the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Aviation
Administration</ORGANIZATION>, suspended <PERSON>Corrigan</PERSON> from flying for five days after
he made his unauthorized flight.
   But <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Ireland</LOCATION> loved his explanation. After he returned
to <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, he was given a ticker-tape parade. There was a meeting
with President <PERSON>Franklin Roosevelt</PERSON>, and a movie, ``The Flying
Irishman,'' starring <PERSON>Corrigan</PERSON> as himself.
   Corrigan, a woodworker, was inspired to try aviation when he
helped build the ``Spirit of <LOCATION>St. Louis</LOCATION>,'' which <PERSON>Charles Lindbergh</PERSON>
flew across the ocean in <DATE>1927</DATE>. He bought his plane for <MONEY>$310</MONEY> in <DATE>1931</DATE>
and spent <MONEY>$590</MONEY> modifying it.
   Also present at the ceremony welcoming <PERSON>Corrigan</PERSON> to <LOCATION>Ireland</LOCATION> were
Transport Minister <PERSON>John Wilson</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Dublin</LOCATION>'s deputy lord mayor <PERSON>Alice
Glenn</PERSON>, and <ORGANIZATION>Aer Lingus</ORGANIZATION> chief executive <PERSON>David Kennedy</PERSON>, who wished ``a
hearty cead mile failte -- 100,000 welcomes _ to <PERSON>Mr. Douglas</PERSON> `Wrong
Way' <PERSON>Corrigan</PERSON>.''

LINDBERGH NEEDS A SHORT-TERM FIX; 
</P>
<P>
BUT SEARCH FOR NEW SITE SHOULD BE PRESSED BEFORE SPENDING $289 MILLION OR MORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's hard to argue with much of what <ORGANIZATION>Lindbergh Field</ORGANIZATION>'s many critics have to 
say. The downtown airport is in the wrong place for a growing metropolis, 
making for some white-knuckle flying past city skyscrapers. The single runway 
is uncomfortably short, maybe dangerously so. The noise created by takeoffs 
over <LOCATION>Point Loma</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Loma Portal</LOCATION> is horrendous. 
</P>
<P>
In short, <PERSON>Lindbergh</PERSON> has to be moved. We all know it. 
</P>
<P>
But, even if city leaders picked a site tomorrow, there would be no new airport 
for at least a decade, probably more. That's why <PERSON>Lindbergh</PERSON> must be expanded to 
handle passenger traffic that is expected to steadily increase over the next 
decade. The continued growth of <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>'s economy also demands it. 
</P>
<P>
That leaves the question of how much expansion is necessary. For now, the 
<MONEY>$27-million</MONEY> emergency plan already adopted by the <ORGANIZATION>Port District</ORGANIZATION> appears 
adequate. We see no reason for the port to leap ahead with either of two very 
expensive expansion plans that would take <PERSON>Lindbergh</PERSON> into the early part of next 
century, and in the process take the urgency out of the new effort to create a 
binational airport on Otay <LOCATION>Mesa</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The interim plan now being implemented would take care of <LOCATION>Lindbergh</LOCATION>'s most 
critical needs. It would move the leaking fuel tanks that supply <PERSON>Lindbergh</PERSON>'s 
jets, increasing fuel storage capacity limited by <ORGANIZATION>Lindbergh</ORGANIZATION>'s cramped 
configuration. That would take trucks that must constantly replenish 
<PERSON>Lindbergh</PERSON>'s one-day fuel supply off Harbor Drive. It would add eight passenger 
gates and baggage claim areas. It would build a better access route to <ORGANIZATION>Harbor 
Drive</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Those improvements would allow <LOCATION>Lindbergh</LOCATION> to accommodate about 16.5 million 
passengers, the number expected to use the airport by <DATE>1996</DATE> or <DATE>1997</DATE>. The two 
major expansion options -- one costing <MONEY>$289 million</MONEY>, the other priced at <MONEY>$385 
million</MONEY> -- are designed to stretch airport capacity to about 24 million, the 
number of passengers expected by <DATE>2010</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
There appears to be time to consider those options in the future. The port 
should set itself a reasonable short-term deadline for determining if the 
latest effort is going to take off. If it doesn't -- and recent history does 
not indicate much hope of success -- the <LOCATION>Port</LOCATION> can take up the expansion plans 
discussed at this week's public hearing. That hearing was held only because the 
<ORGANIZATION>City Council</ORGANIZATION> asked for it. 
</P>
<P>
If the port is in the mood to spend money, it might want to consider purchasing 
the ill-conceived <ORGANIZATION>Laurel Travel Center</ORGANIZATION> at the foot of the runway and taking it 
down a level or two. That would ameliorate the fears of pilots who have called 
it an accident waiting to happen -- regardless of the <ORGANIZATION>FAA</ORGANIZATION>'s opinion that the 
building is not a hazard. 
</P>
<P>
It would be a mistake to derail the effort to relocate <PERSON>Lindbergh</PERSON> to a better 
spot by making plans to expand the current site to accommodate 24 million 
people.

REMEMBERING 'THE GREATEST FIGHTER PLANE IN THE WORLD';

AIRCRAFT: JEAN-LUC BEGHIN FIRST SAW THE P-51 MUSTANG IN THE SKIES OVER EUROPE 
DURING WORLD WAR II. THUS BEGAN A LOVE AFFAIR THAT HAS LASTED 46 YEARS.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Though 46 years have passed, the moment remains vivid to <PERSON>Jean-Luc Beghin</PERSON>. He 
can still see the planes chasing each other in the skies over war-torn 
<LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION>. The German plane, he remembers, was dark and menacing. The other, an 
American fighter, its engine thundering, was brightly decorated with huge white 
stars on its wings and fuselage. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a dogfight," <PERSON>Beghin</PERSON> says of that <DATE>spring</DATE> day in <DATE>1944</DATE>. "I was in 
kindergarten and all the kids wanted to watch." 
</P>
<P>
Beghin does not remember much about the German plane. "I was only 5 years old 
at the time," he explains. But he recalls every detail about the American 
fighter and especially the words of one teacher who joined her students staring 
up at the sky. "I remember her saying, 'That's a Mustang.' " 
</P>
<P>
The P-51 Mustang. Just the name brings a smile to <PERSON>Beghin</PERSON>. For it was, he says, 
more than a fighter plane. It was a symbol. Proud. Flashy. Powerful. "It was my 
image of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Today, <PERSON>Beghin</PERSON> lives in <LOCATION>Westchester</LOCATION>, only a mile or so from the former <ORGANIZATION>North 
American Aviation</ORGANIZATION> plant where the P-51 was born and built. And <PERSON>Beghin</PERSON> is among 
those celebrating the <DATE>50th anniversary today</DATE> of the fighter's first test flight 
over <LOCATION>Inglewood</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The 51-year-old artist is completing a pen-and-ink rendition of the aircraft's 
cockpit for the French aviation magazine, Info Pilote. The publication's 
six-page tribute to the P-51 will be among many celebrations worldwide, 
including air shows and exhibits this <DATE>weekend</DATE> from <LOCATION>Santa Maria</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, to 
<LOCATION>Duxforth</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
But none of the anniversary tributes will be any more personal than <PERSON>Beghin</PERSON>'s. 
For the P-51 Mustang inspired <PERSON>Beghin</PERSON> as a boy and launched a love affair with 
aviation that continues today, particularly in his pen-and-ink drawings of 
aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
"It is my main purpose in life," he says. 
</P>
<P>
From his days as an aviation illustrator for the <ORGANIZATION>Belgian Air Force</ORGANIZATION> to his 
employment today as a flight coordinator for <ORGANIZATION>Air France</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Beghin</PERSON>'s life has 
revolved around aviation. 
</P>
<P>
His works, displayed at the <ORGANIZATION>Smithsonian</ORGANIZATION> Institution and <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Houston Museum</ORGANIZATION>, 
depict aircraft subjects ranging from <PERSON>Charles Lindbergh</PERSON>'s "Spirit of <LOCATION>St. Louis</LOCATION>" 
to the Apollo cockpit. In all, about 20 renderings by <PERSON>Beghin</PERSON> have been 
commissioned for aviation exhibits and publications. 
</P>
<P>
Now, those works will be joined by <PERSON>Beghin</PERSON>'s drawings of the P-51, an aircraft 
originally commissioned by the <ORGANIZATION>Royal Air Force</ORGANIZATION> only months before the <LOCATION>United 
States</LOCATION> joined World War II. 
</P>
<P>
"In <DATE>1940</DATE>, the British were short of fighter planes and came to <ORGANIZATION>North American 
Aviation</ORGANIZATION>, which had built the AT-6 trainer for <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>," says <PERSON>Beghin</PERSON>, who has 
followed the P-51's history since his youth. 
</P>
<P>
Given four months to design and build a new fighter for <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>, the aircraft 
company (later absorbed by <ORGANIZATION>Rockwell International</ORGANIZATION>) unveiled the P-51 Mustang, a 
sleek, soaring aircraft faster than any fighter before it. Soon, the aircraft 
established itself as the finest American-built fighter used by the <ORGANIZATION>Royal Air 
Force</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> began purchasing the fighters, the <ORGANIZATION>RAF</ORGANIZATION> had 
replaced the <ORGANIZATION>Mustangs</ORGANIZATION>' unreliable first engines with 1,600-horsepower engines 
built by <ORGANIZATION>Rolls-Royce</ORGANIZATION>. Later, the same engines, built in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> by 
<ORGANIZATION>Packard</ORGANIZATION>, were installed in the P-51s commissioned by the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Army Air Corps</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The new engines allowed the P-51 a top speed of 487 miles an hour. And the 
addition of auxiliary fuel tanks extended its flying range enough for the 
aircraft to escort American bombers all the way from <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Berlin</LOCATION>. Those 
bombers included the B-17, whose exploits have been popularized in the current 
movie, "<LOCATION>Memphis Belle</LOCATION>." 
</P>
<P>
"It became the greatest fighter plane in the world," says <PERSON>Beghin</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
After <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> unveiled the world's first jet fighter, it was a P-51, flown by 
the soon-to-be-famous test pilot <PERSON>Chuck Yeager</PERSON>, that downed a Messerschmidt 262. 
</P>
<P>
And of course, when <PERSON>Beghin</PERSON> was a boy, it was a P-51 that he remembers helping 
to liberate his homeland. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, he says, his fascination with the aircraft has never waned. 
</P>
<P>
In <DATE>1981</DATE>, he spoke with the P-51's designer, <PERSON>Edgar Schmued</PERSON>, who lived in <ORGANIZATION>Rancho 
Palos Verdes</ORGANIZATION> and died in <DATE>1985</DATE>. And two months ago, <PERSON>Beghin</PERSON> took his first flight 
in a P-51 during a trip to <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>. "When we took off, I had some tears in my 
eyes," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Someday, <PERSON>Beghin</PERSON> adds, he will finally finish a book on the P-51 Mustang. "I've 
been working on it for some time," he says. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, he will continue his drawings. And, he says, there are plenty 
of memories of the P-51 that will forever connect him to his youth. 
</P>
<P>
Like the time, just after the war, when <PERSON>Beghin</PERSON> bought package after package of 
<LOCATION>Belgium</LOCATION> chocolate bars, just to collect an aviation history card of the P-51 
Mustang. "Some of my friends had the card and I kept buying the chocolate just 
to get one. I don't remember how many bars I finally ate," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Or the moment, after <LOCATION>Belgium</LOCATION>'s liberation in <DATE>September, 1944</DATE>, when <PERSON>Beghin</PERSON> got 
his first close look at one of the aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
"They had a Mustang on display in the public square. I remember going up and 
touching the bare metal and seeing the plane up close. The bright colors and 
that white star. 
</P>
<P>
"It was," he says, "like Disneyland before its time."

<LEADPARA>  THE WHEELS of a Cessna 185 touched down on the tarmac of the Redding Airport
recently, ending the 41-year saga of veteran Department of Fish and Game pilot
Pat Symons.;   Symons, 67, was hired as a warden-pilot in 1950. Since then he
has logged more than 22,000 hours and 2.5 million miles flying every
imaginable type of mission for the DFG, including law enforcement, aerial fish
planting and wildlife surveys.  </LEADPARA>

<MEMO>  Outdoors  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     To <PERSON>Symons</PERSON>, who with his wife, <PERSON>Joan</PERSON>, makes his home in <LOCATION>Cottonwood</LOCATION>, the last
day on the job was like any other.;   "I had two projects. One was a survey
flight over the <LOCATION>Tehama Wildlife Area</LOCATION>, most of which is closed to access this
time year, to make sure no one was locked up inside the area.;   "Then an
anadromous fisheries biologist climbed aboard and we cruised the <LOCATION>Sacramento
River</LOCATION> from <LOCATION>Princeton</LOCATION> to <PERSON>Keswick</PERSON> Dam looking for new salmon redds.";   Looking
back, <PERSON>Symons</PERSON> says that "<PERSON>Charles Lindbergh</PERSON>'s flight across the <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> in <DATE>1927</DATE>
fired the aviation mindedness of a lot of young people, including me.";   He
steered his education toward aeronautical engineering until World War II came
along. He joined the <ORGANIZATION>Air Corps</ORGANIZATION> and became a pilot, flying twin-engine C46
cargo planes over the "hump" -- the <LOCATION>Himalayas</LOCATION> -- in the Chinese-Burma-India
Theater.;   Following the war, <PERSON>Symons</PERSON> returned to school and earned a degree
in aircraft and engine maintenance and in <DATE>1950</DATE> went to work for the DFG.;  
"We used to do anything we could possibly think of," says <PERSON>Symons</PERSON>. "We flew air
patrols hunting for violators in all kinds of situations, but the most
dramatic and glamorous thing we did was high altitude fish planting.";  
<PERSON>Symons</PERSON> was one of the first pilots to do aerial fish plants in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>.
"For all the glamour of aerial fish planting," says <PERSON>Symons</PERSON>, "it was a mass
production money-maker in the sense that it was the cheapest way to get fish
into the high mountain lakes.;   "There are a jillion tight lakes, some
because they are tiny, some because they're way, way down in a hole and you
have to point the plane straight down to get to them. Once in a while we'd
have a judgment screw-up and miss the lake, but that didn't happen very
often.";   Before moving to the Redding area in <DATE>1974</DATE>, <PERSON>Symons</PERSON> spent 22 years in
<LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION>, where he also flew ocean patrols and biological surveys
spotting sardines, mackerel, gray whales, harbor seals and sea otters. Flying
sea otter surveys was the hardest and most boring, according to Symons.;  
"There's nothing to see but a lot of glaring water and occasionally a little
pod of sea otters. But you have to pay attention because you have to keep

enforcement flights in the <DATE>1950s</DATE>. "I remember flying the <ORGANIZATION>Cleveland National
Forest</ORGANIZATION> out of <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>," says <PERSON>Symons</PERSON>, "when I found what looked like a couple
of hunters in a closed area. I circled for a while waiting for a ground warden
to come in.;   "Apparently my circling flushed out several other people. The

The <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> crab season was closed and <PERSON>Don</PERSON> was concerned that a number of
<LOCATION>Oregon</LOCATION> boats would come into our closed waters. Because the weather was very
foggy, they did. Don and I, flying in the fog, were able to spot and identify
a number of boats, making a number of commercial cases.";   "The prettiest
flying was the <DATE>spring</DATE> flights to check the high mountain lakes," says <PERSON>Symons</PERSON>.

NO QUICK STUDY ON SITE FOR AIRPORT; 
</P>
<P>
AVIATION: THE PANEL SEEKING AN ALTERNATIVE FOR LINDBERGH FIELD WANTS MORE TIME 
AND MONEY TO DO THE JOB. ONE COUNCILMAN CALLS IT A WASTE.

<P>
The panel studying the relocation of <ORGANIZATION>Lindbergh Field</ORGANIZATION> agreed <DATE>Thursday</DATE> to extend 
its review another year and spend <MONEY>$350,000</MONEY> to <MONEY>$400,000</MONEY> more to examine the 
"multiple airport option" unveiled last month by <LOCATION>San Diego City</LOCATION> Councilmen <PERSON>Ron 
Roberts</PERSON> and <PERSON>Bob Filner</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
If approved today by the <ORGANIZATION>San Diego Assn. of Governments' Board of Directors</ORGANIZATION>, 
the <ORGANIZATION>Airport Policy Advisory Committee</ORGANIZATION>'s recommendation would about double the 
cost and duration of the search for an alternative to increasingly crowded 
<ORGANIZATION>Lindbergh Field</ORGANIZATION>, a study financed by a <MONEY>$350,000</MONEY> <ORGANIZATION>Federal Aviation Administration</ORGANIZATION> 
grant. 
</P>
<P>
But <PERSON>Filner</PERSON>, who with <PERSON>Roberts</PERSON> led the call for a look at the two-airport plan, 
said the effort will be worthless because of restrictions on the scope of the 
study imposed by the panel. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a complete waste of money," <PERSON>Filner</PERSON> said after the panel's meeting. "It's 
just a complete waste of money." 
</P>
<P>
Filner claimed that, as now written, the new study will automatically reject 
the multiple-airport option and point toward the three alternatives already 
identified by the Sandag airport committee: <LOCATION>Miramar Naval Air Station</LOCATION>, a tract 
east of <LOCATION>Miramar</LOCATION> and a huge parcel on Otay <LOCATION>Mesa</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
That is because the new examination will require that at least one of the 
region's airports accommodate 20 million passengers annually, a 12,000-foot 
runway, 5,000-foot safety zones at either end of the runway, simultaneous 
landings on widely separated landing strips, and full instrument-landing 
capacity. Under consideration would be <LOCATION>Lindbergh</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Brown</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Montgomery</LOCATION> fields 
in <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Gillespie Field</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>El Cajon</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>McClellan-Palomar Airport</LOCATION> in 
<LOCATION>Carlsbad</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Filner and <PERSON>Roberts</PERSON>' multiple airport option is based on the assumption that no 
site in the county could accommodate the estimated 35 million airline 
passengers expected to fly here by the middle of next century. It seeks to 
determine whether the load could be parceled out to <PERSON>Lindbergh</PERSON> and an expanded 
<ORGANIZATION>Brown Field</ORGANIZATION>, along with <PERSON>Montgomery</PERSON> and McClellan-Palomar airports. The Sandag 
panel added <PERSON>Gillespie</PERSON> to the list. 
</P>
<P>
The councilmen believe that <LOCATION>Miramar</LOCATION> could handle the traffic, but believe it is 
politically unlikely that the <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> would allow a civilian or joint-use airport 
there. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts aide <PERSON>Wayne Raffesberger</PERSON> said the safety zone and runway length 
requirements would rule out <LOCATION>Lindbergh</LOCATION>, and the safety zone and 
instrument-landing requirements would appear to eliminate the expanded <ORGANIZATION>Brown 
Field</ORGANIZATION> plan unveiled by the councilmen last month with the help of a coalition 
of <LOCATION>South Bay</LOCATION> landowners. But he was hesitant to condemn the study entirely. 
</P>
<P>
"Those criteria, if strictly applied would appear to eliminate all five of 
those airports, I think," <PERSON>Raffesberger</PERSON> said. But, he added, "I don't know what 
to make of it yet. We hadn't seen those criteria." Roberts is attending an 
<ORGANIZATION>Urban Land Institute</ORGANIZATION> meeting out of town and could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Hedy St. John</PERSON>, chairwoman of the study panel's technical committee, said she 
"would respectfully disagree" with <PERSON>Filner</PERSON>'s assessment, arguing that, even at 
<LOCATION>Lindbergh</LOCATION>, land could be purchased to accommodate 5,000-foot safety zones at 
either end of the airport's 9,400-foot single runway. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, she argued, safety criteria should not be compromised at the 
beginning of the study. "To compromise the standards and give the people of 
this region inadequate air and ground safety is not acceptable as a starting 
point," <ORGANIZATION>St. John</ORGANIZATION> said. 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>Air Line Pilots Assn.</ORGANIZATION>, which favors the joint use of <LOCATION>Miramar</LOCATION> as the safest 
alternative, endorsed the safety criteria at a meeting of the technical 
committee <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
South Bay politicians, including <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON>Jim Bates</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-San Diego</LOCATION>, State <PERSON>Sen. 
Wadie Deddeh</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-Chula Vista</LOCATION>, and <PERSON>Filner</PERSON>, will ask Sandag in a letter to be 
delivered today to consider the joint use of <LOCATION>Miramar</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Filner</PERSON> said. An <ORGANIZATION>ALPA</ORGANIZATION> 
official also has signed that letter, he said.

   Gang violence and drug peddling at a
housing project behind a junior high school show no signs of going
away, so officials are trying to make the campus bulletproof by
building a 10-foot high wall.
   Faculty and administrators wore T-shirts <DATE>Friday</DATE> bearing ``The
Great Wall of Lindbergh'' logo to show their enthusiasm for the
<MONEY>$160,000</MONEY> project at <ORGANIZATION>Lindbergh Junior High School</ORGANIZATION>. It is scheduled
for completion in six weeks.
   <PERSON>Judy Wade</PERSON>, a physical education teacher, has said she's seen
beer bottles and even bicycle handlebars tossed at students during
her 25 years at the school. ``Now, it's not what they're throwing,
but what they're shooting,'' she said.
   Students were evacuated from the recreation fields twice during
one week in <DATE>April</DATE> because of gunfire. Two years ago, a student
playing basketball after school was hit in the chest by a bullet
that whizzed through a chain-link fence.
   ``They've had trouble there for as long as I can remember,''
said Principal <PERSON>Max Fraley</PERSON>, referring to the problem housing project
that is adjacent to the schoolyard. ``It is a very large area where
a lot of drug dealers congregate.''
   The concrete block wall will extend 300 yards along the school's
playground, separating the school and 1,200 students from the
713-unit <ORGANIZATION>Carmelitos Housing Project</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Fraley</PERSON> said.
   Funds for the wall came from the city school district and <LOCATION>Los
Angeles County</LOCATION> after teacher <PERSON>Joan Reedy</PERSON> was nearly hit recently by
bullets as she walked with students to a softball diamond.
   ``Shots came through the fence and we heard the whizzing by,''
<PERSON>Ms. Reedy</PERSON> said. ``I was OK at first, but when I got home I was
scared. So I went to the <ORGANIZATION>Board of Education</ORGANIZATION> and said, `Something
needs to be done.'''
   Plans call for the wall to be bordered by shrubs and decorated
with a large mural, <PERSON>Fraley</PERSON> said.
   ``We'll use anti-graffiti paint, something that it will be easy
to wash the gang graffiti off of,'' he said.
   The mural will include a painting of the Spirit of <LOCATION>St. Louis</LOCATION>,
the airplane aviator <PERSON>Charles Linbergh</PERSON> flew in <DATE>1927</DATE> in the first
solo trans-Atlantic flight, and a large ``L'' overlapped by a
picture of an eagle, the school mascot.
   The slogan ``Lindbergh Leads the Way'' will top the mural
painted in school colors of blue and red.
   ``A 900-foot wall of this sort is significant because it
recognizes the problems we face <DATE>today</DATE>, and it will make everyone on
school grounds feel a lot safer,'' <PERSON>Fraley</PERSON> said.
   The principal said the student who was hit two years ago while
playing basketball is now in high school and still has the bullet
in him.
   ``The doctors said it would do more harm to take it out, and I'm
told he hasn't suffered any ill effects from it after he recovered
from the gunshot itself,'' <PERSON>Fraley</PERSON> said.
   ``The wall is terrific,'' said student <PERSON>Joe Trejo</PERSON>, 13, who lives
in the Carmelitos project next door. ``Why? Because I don't want to
get shot.''

<LEADPARA>  It's a long way from banging out Led Zeppelin guitar riffs to producing blimps
that really fly.;    But two former Memphis musicians have built a half-dozen
flying machines since leaving rock 'n' roll a decade ago. And the U.S. Army
may soon be flying their latest egg-shaped, helium-filled creation.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  HOW 2 ENTREPRENEURS BUILT A BETTER BLIMP  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Originally designed as a single-seat sport flying vehicle, the four-finned,
60-foot-long blimp known, unromantically, as the Z-200, also happened to meet
<ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> specifications for a remote-controlled observation and communications
platform.;    <DATE>Last summer</DATE>, a research and development team from <ORGANIZATION>Westinghouse
Electric Corp.</ORGANIZATION>'s defense contracting division was dispatched to <LOCATION>Memphis</LOCATION> to
meet <ORGANIZATION>Memphis Airships</ORGANIZATION> owners <PERSON>Steve Garner</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jim Groce.</PERSON>;    The two sides
struck a deal, and now a vanilla white blimp bearing <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Westinghouse</ORGANIZATION>
insignia awaits flight testing at the <ORGANIZATION>Memphis Airships</ORGANIZATION>' Presidents Island
hangar.;    "It looks so great that sometimes it's hard to contain the urge to
just hop in it and fly," said <PERSON>Garner</PERSON>, 39, a former engineering student at the
<ORGANIZATION>University of Florida</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>University of Tennessee</ORGANIZATION>. "But our company's
future is riding on this thing -- and besides, it belongs to them -- not us.";
   <ORGANIZATION>Westinghouse</ORGANIZATION>, a giant Pittsburgh-based electronics firm, paid about <MONEY>$50,000</MONEY>
for the blimp. Company officials have not decided whether it will be flown
first by a pilot or through a ground-based remote control system. Flight tests
are scheduled for early <DATE>1991</DATE>, and <PERSON>Garner</PERSON> and <PERSON>Groce</PERSON> want to get started.;   
"We've fulfilled our construction contract, and we are now waiting for the
operational contract," <PERSON>Garner</PERSON> said. "Our program doesn't seem to have been
affected by federal budget cuts, and we look forward to showing people how
well it can perform.";    The 9,500-cubic foot blimp has roughly one-tenth the
volume of a typical hot-air balloon. It is designed to have a 43 mph top
speed, a 32 mph cruise speed and a maximum ceiling of 6,500 feet. It will be
able to carry up to 275 pounds -- enough to hoist radar equipment for
monitoring borders, video cameras for surveillance or high-tech communications
systems.;    <PERSON>Garner</PERSON> and <PERSON>Groce</PERSON> say they don't know how the blimps will be used
-- and the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> isn't saying.;    But armies and dirigibles have a long and
not-so-illustrious history. The first air raid was carried out by German
dirigibles over <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> during World War I, when crew members tossed bombs out
by hand.;    The massive, hydrogen-filled dirigibles turned out to be as
explosive as their payloads, however, and made easy targets for British
airplanes and anti-aircraft guns.;    Before being pressed into military
service, dirigibles carried air mail in <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> as early as <DATE>1912</DATE>. An English
dirigible was the first airborne vehicle to cross the <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> in <DATE>1919</DATE> --
eight years before <PERSON>Charles Lindbergh</PERSON>'s famous solo flight.;    The golden age
of airships came to a famous and fiery finish in <DATE>1937</DATE> when the hydrogen-filled
Hindenburg exploded while trying to dock in <LOCATION>Lakehurst</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>, killing 37 of the
95 people aboard.;    The diminutive airships <PERSON>Garner</PERSON> and <PERSON>Groce</PERSON> make would be
dwarfed by the leviathans of yesteryear -- but the two say their products
could spur a blimp revival.;    "Companies could buy them for advertising
purposes -- like miniature versions of the <ORGANIZATION>Goodyear</ORGANIZATION> blimp," <PERSON>Garner</PERSON> said.;   
"Police could use them to watch traffic, scientists could use them to monitor
whale migrations along the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> coast, and individuals could use them
for fun flying. There's no end to the potential uses.";    Civilian versions
will sell for about <MONEY>$50,000</MONEY> each and are designed to fit <ORGANIZATION>Federal Aviation
Administration</ORGANIZATION> guidelines for ultra-light aircraft. That means pilots won't
need licenses to fly them.;    <PERSON>Garner</PERSON> and <PERSON>Groce</PERSON> say blimp buyers will be
required to pass an airship flying program on the grassy fields outside their
facility before they'll get the keys, however.;    The two claim their blimps
will be able to perform many of the same tasks as helicopters, but cheaper. A
Z-200's 24-horse-power engine burns about 2 1/2 gallons of fuel per hour
compared with about 25 gallons per hour for helicopters. A blimp can stay
airborne for about nine hours compared with about three for the helos.;    But
blimps are not without operational costs: It takes <MONEY>$1,000</MONEY> in helium to fill a
Z-200, and the blimps need to be topped off every three or four months.;   
<PERSON>Garner</PERSON> and <PERSON>Groce</PERSON> say blimps are their passion, but their company's seven
full-time and three part-time employees earn most of their money making
inflatable advertisements: giant beer cans, tanning lotion, bottles, tires,
etc.;    The profitable advertising side of the business has supported blimp
endeavors in the past, but the two are counting on their new gas bag to change
all that.  </TEXT>

<ORGANIZATION>Jimsair Aviation Services</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> aircraft fueling and service company 
with operations at <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Lindbergh Field</LOCATION> and in <LOCATION>Palm Springs</LOCATION>, has filed 
for protection under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code. 
</P>
<P>
President <PERSON>Phil Bracamonte</PERSON> said the company's high debt -- taken on to finance 
expansion -- coupled with a downturn in business forced it to seek protection 
from creditors. 
</P>
<P>
There will be no disruption of services and no layoffs of the company's 65 
employees, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, <PERSON>Bracamonte</PERSON> said the company has <MONEY>$8.9 million</MONEY> in assets and 
<MONEY>$8.4 million</MONEY> in liabilities. Among the assets is a lease for hangar space 
through the year <DATE>2014</DATE> with the <LOCATION>San Diego Unified Port District</LOCATION>, operator of 
<ORGANIZATION>Lindbergh Field</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The company recently spent a considerable sum doubling its hangar space at 
<LOCATION>Lindbergh</LOCATION>, but <PERSON>Bracamonte</PERSON> said problems with the <LOCATION>Palm Springs</LOCATION> facility were 
more to blame for the financial difficulties that led to the bankruptcy filing. 
</P>
<P>
The company's major creditors include <ORGANIZATION>Textron</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>First National Bank of San Diego</ORGANIZATION> 
and <ORGANIZATION>BP Oil</ORGANIZATION>, the firm's attorney <PERSON>Peter L. Duncan</PERSON> said <DATE>Thursday</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Jimsair filed its bankruptcy petition in the court of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Bankruptcy <PERSON>Judge 
James W. Meyers</PERSON>. The company was founded in <DATE>1952</DATE>, when it established a 
presence at <LOCATION>Lindbergh</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Bracamonte</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
A sale of the company to Flightcraft of <LOCATION>Portland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ore.</LOCATION> was announced last year

DIRE RESULTS PREDICTED WITHOUT A NEW AIRPORT; 
</P>
<P>
STUDY FORESEES AIRLINE CONGESTION, LOSS OF ECONOMIC GROWTH AS CONSEQUENCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
<LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> will have one of the nation's most congested airports and lose 
<MONEY>billions of dollars</MONEY> in forfeited economic growth if no new airport is built by 
<DATE>2010</DATE>, a new study warns. 
</P>
<P>
Replacing the overburdened <ORGANIZATION>Lindbergh Field</ORGANIZATION> with a larger airport would add <MONEY>$33 
billion</MONEY> to <MONEY>$53 billion</MONEY> to the region's economy over the next seven decades, 
according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
The study, commissioned by the <ORGANIZATION>San Diego Assn. of Governments</ORGANIZATION> (Sandag) and 
written by <PERSON>KPMB Peat Marwick</PERSON> of <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, was made public <DATE>Monday</DATE>. By 
comparing the long-term economic impact of a new airport to that of <LOCATION>Lindbergh 
Field</LOCATION>, the study provides fresh ammunition for those arguing that <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> 
must build a new field. 
</P>
<P>
The study echoes "what we and others have been saying for a long time," said 
<PERSON>San Diego Councilman Ron Roberts</PERSON>, a major proponent of a new airport. "What 
surprises me is the magnitude of the problem -- both the potential losses and 
the congestion at Lindbergh." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Stand Taken 
</P>
<P>
But, although the report estimated the economic impact of both options, it did 
not endorse either of them, cautioned Sandag special projects director <PERSON>Jack 
Koerper</PERSON>, who heads the group's airport relocation study. 
</P>
<P>
"If people want to use this information, then that's their right," <PERSON>Koerper</PERSON> 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The report is full of information that might spur debate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Turnover Expected to Double 
</P>
<P>
It predicts that <ORGANIZATION>Lindbergh Field</ORGANIZATION>'s current passenger turnover of 10 million 
annually will double by the year <DATE>2011</DATE>. Even before that happens, passengers can 
expect average flight delays of five to 10 minutes, and 25 minutes to one hour 
and 40 minutes during peak hours, congestion comparable to that of <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>'s 
<LOCATION>O'Hare</LOCATION> airport, the authors noted. 
</P>
<P>
At that point, airlines would begin to divert flights from <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> and stop 
expanding their local operations, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Loss of Jobs 
</P>
<P>
Failure to replace <ORGANIZATION>Lindbergh Field</ORGANIZATION> with a new airport would cost the region 
48,000 airport jobs by <DATE>2060</DATE>, the authors predicted. That year, <ORGANIZATION>Lindbergh Field</ORGANIZATION> 
could accommodate 25 million passengers, while 40 million could pass through a 
new airport if one was built, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
The industry that has more at stake than most is tourism, said Sandag economist 
<ORGANIZATION>Marney Cox</ORGANIZATION>. Of the <MONEY>$1.22 billion</MONEY> <ORGANIZATION>Lindbergh Field</ORGANIZATION> contributed to the local 
economy in <DATE>1988</DATE>, <MONEY>$700 million</MONEY> was money spent here by visiting air travelers, 
the report said. Tourist spending would account for much of the money generated 
by a new airport (and lost if it is not built), <ORGANIZATION>Cox</ORGANIZATION> said. But he said the 
report did not address how many visitors would come to the city by other means 
of transport when faced with an overcrowded <ORGANIZATION>Lindbergh Field</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The latest report is part of a continuing Sandag study of <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>'s airport 
system, including plans for a new airport. Next month, planners will take one 
last look at <LOCATION>Lindbergh Field</LOCATION> to see if it could be expanded to satisfy the 
region's future needs, <PERSON>Koerper</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
Proposed alternatives include two sites in and next to the <LOCATION>Miramar Naval Air 
Station</LOCATION> and one on the U. S.-Mexican border on <LOCATION>Otay Mesa</LOCATION>.
