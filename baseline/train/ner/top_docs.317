   Typhoon Koryn headed
north of this <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> island commonwealth in the <LOCATION>Pacific Ocean</LOCATION> on
<DATE>Monday</DATE> with winds gusting to 110 mph, and forecasters believed the
storm had hit its peak, officials said.
   On <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION>, crews worked to clear damage and restore water and
power service cut when the storm hit <DATE>Sunday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>.
   By noon <DATE>Monday</DATE> (<TIME>9 p.m.</TIME> <DATE>Sunday</DATE> EST), <PERSON>Koryn</PERSON>'s center was 40 miles
north of <LOCATION>Saipan</LOCATION>, and the storm was moving north-northeast at 8 mph,
said <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> Lt. <PERSON>Diane Crittenden</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Joint Typhoon Warning Center</ORGANIZATION>
on <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION>.
   The typhoon, with maximum sustained winds of 85 mph and gusts
reaching 110 mph, was believed to have reached its peak, she said.
   If the storm kept to its course, it would not hit any other
islands in the <LOCATION>Northern Marianas</LOCATION>, but might hit the Japanese island
of Minami-Tori, according to <PERSON>Ms. Crittendon</PERSON>.
   Residents on <LOCATION>Saipan</LOCATION> boarded up houses, put boats to sea and
moved to community shelters, said <ORGANIZATION>Civil Defense</ORGANIZATION> coordinator <PERSON>Felix
Sasamopo</PERSON>. The airport was closed.
   On <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION>, water service was restored to about <PERCENT>40 percent</PERCENT> of the
island's population of 130,000, and <PERCENT>40 percent</PERCENT> remained without
electricity, said <PERSON>Ben Reyes</PERSON>, a staff officer with <ORGANIZATION>Guam Civil
Defense</ORGANIZATION>.
   Winds tore tin roofs off two houses in <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> and forced more than
500 people into emergency shelters <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, but only a few remained
in shelters after the storm passed, said <PERSON>Reyes</PERSON>. Two minor injuries
were reported.
   The <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> airport was reopened after the typhoon passed. Guam is
also home to <ORGANIZATION>Andersen Air Force Base</ORGANIZATION>.
   Both <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Northern Marianas</LOCATION> are located west of the

   The <ORGANIZATION>Internal Revenue Service</ORGANIZATION> notified <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Northern Mariana Islands</LOCATION> that interest on <MONEY>$380 million</MONEY> of municipal bonds issued by the two <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> jurisdictions isn't tax-exempt. 

   But the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> made it clear it hasn't reached the point of moving to tax interest income earned by bondholders. 

   The Territory of <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> sold <MONEY>$300 million</MONEY> of bonds as tax-exempt securities in <DATE>October 1985</DATE>. 
The Commonwealth of the <ORGANIZATION>Northern Mariana Islands</ORGANIZATION> sold <MONEY>$80 million</MONEY> of bonds as tax-exempts in <DATE>December 1984</DATE>. 
Both issues were underwritten by <ORGANIZATION>Matthews &amp; Wright Inc</ORGANIZATION>. 

   A <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> grand jury in <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> late last year cited the <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Northern Mariana Islands</LOCATION> bond issues, among others, in a 52-count indictment charging <ORGANIZATION>Matthews &amp; Wright Executive</ORGANIZATION> Vice President <PERSON>Arthur Abba Goldberg</PERSON> and a one-time company consultant with promoting a nationwide fraud involving more than <MONEY>$2 billion</MONEY> in municipal bonds. 
<PERSON>Mr. Goldberg</PERSON> has pleaded innocent. 
His trial isn't expected to get under way until next year. 
The company has denied any wrongdoing. 

   "After thorough consideration, we have concluded that interest on the (<LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION>) bonds is not tax-exempt under section 103 of the Code," <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON>Lawrence Gibbs</PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION>Guam Gov. Joseph Ada</ORGANIZATION> in a letter. 
The same message was delivered to Gov. <PERSON>Pedro Tenorio</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Northern Mariana Islands</ORGANIZATION>. 

   The action wasn't wholly unexpected. 
Gov. <ORGANIZATION>Ada</ORGANIZATION> told a congressional panel earlier this year that the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> was going to declare the <MONEY>$300 million</MONEY> issue taxable. 

   <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> officials have refused to discuss the bonds in question, and a spokesman declined yesterday to comment on the issues. 
Officials of <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Northern Mariana Islands</ORGANIZATION> couldn't be reached immediately for comment. 

   Attorney <PERSON>David Aufhauser</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Williams &amp; Connolly, Matthews &amp; Wright</ORGANIZATION>'s law firm, emphasized the view that the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION>'s conclusions are "only preliminary." 
He said <ORGANIZATION>Matthews &amp; Wright</ORGANIZATION> is confident the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION>'s conclusions will be "reconsidered and changed" in due course. 

   The <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> said in the letters, "If desired, we will also consider whether there are good and sufficient reasons for finally resolving this matter through the use of a closing agreement," explaining that under such agreements, "the service forgoes taxing the interest in the hands of the bondholder but collects all or an appropriate percentage of such lost revenues from the issuer." 

   Guam and the <ORGANIZATION>Northern Mariana Islands</ORGANIZATION> separately have filed lawsuits against parties involved in the issuance of the bonds, including <ORGANIZATION>Matthews &amp; Wright</ORGANIZATION>.

   Typhoon Koryn, packing sustained winds of 75
mph and gusts to 90 mph, swept past this <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Pacific territory
<DATE>Sunday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> before heading toward the <LOCATION>Northern Mariana Islands</LOCATION>,
authorities said.
   High winds and heavy rains knocked out electricity over <PERCENT>30
percent</PERCENT> of <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION>, cutting power to 56 of the island's 90 water
wells, officials said.
   Winds ranging from 35 to 55 mph ripped tin roofs off two houses
and forced 21 people into emergcy shelters, the officials said.
   There were two reports of minor injuries. A 50-year-old man
suffered a cut ear while trying to put up shutters and a
46-year-old woman was injured when she was blown into a pole. Both
were treated and released from <ORGANIZATION>Guam Memorial Hospital</ORGANIZATION>, a hospital
spokesman said.
   As of <TIME>7 p.m.</TIME> (<TIME>4 a.m. EST</TIME>), <PERSON>Koryn</PERSON> was 44 miles northeast of <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION>,
moving to the northwest at 8 mph, according to <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> Lt.<PERSON>j.g. Ken
Minogue</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Joint Typhoon Warning Center Rapid Response Team</ORGANIZATION>.
   The typhoon was forecast to pass to the north of Rota, the most
southern of the <LOCATION>Northern Marianas</LOCATION>, a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> commonwealth, some 40
miles north of <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Minogue</PERSON> said.
   Rota was getting heavy rains and winds up to 50 mph, the same
conditions the <LOCATION>Mariana</LOCATION> islands of <LOCATION>Tinian</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Saipan</LOCATION> could expect
<DATE>Monday</DATE>, he said.
   On <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION>, all <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> aircraft were placed in hangers for protection
against the strong winds, and the USS Haleakala was sent out to sea
to weather the storm, said Lt. <PERSON>Dave Lee</PERSON>. Three other warships were
allowed to remain in port, he said.
   Twelve planes, including 11 B-52s, at <ORGANIZATION>Andersen Air Force Base</ORGANIZATION> on
the north coast of <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION>, were parked behind fortifications as the
storm approached, said base spokesman Capt. <PERSON>Wayne Perry</PERSON>.
   A tropical storm has sustained winds ranging from 39 to 73 mph.
A typhoon has a minimum sustained surface wind of 74 mph.

   Typhoon <PERSON>Russ</PERSON> raked <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> today with wind up to
135 mph and pummeled the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> territory's southern coast with huge
waves that caused severe flooding.
   No serious injuries or deaths were reported, but power and water
service were disrupted in many areas and police reported some
looting, <PERSON>Ken Booth</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Guam Cable TV</ORGANIZATION> said.
   The storm was the strongest to hit this western <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> island
in more than a decade. Its eye moved within 15 miles of <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION>'s
southern coast <DATE>early today</DATE>, and wind hit 135 mph in the south and
90 mph with gusts of 115 mph in central and northern areas, said
Lt. <PERSON>Diane Edson</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Joint Typhoon Warning Center</ORGANIZATION>.
   Fifteen minor injuries and no deaths were reported, <ORGANIZATION>Booth</ORGANIZATION> said.
   ``It was quite a blow, but not as bad as had been expected,'' he
said.
   Gov. <PERSON>Joseph Ada</PERSON> said about 500 families in the southern town of
Agat were displaced, <ORGANIZATION>Booth</ORGANIZATION> reported. About 2,500 people sought
shelter during the storm.
   Power and water service remained down in many areas, and
officials said it would be three days before full power was
restored, according to <LOCATION>Booth</LOCATION>.
   Booth said police reported looting in some areas. The duty-free
store in the central town of Tumon reported being robbed of
<MONEY>$250,000</MONEY> in Rolex watches and an undetermined amount of other
jewelry. There were reports of looting in other areas as well. No
arrests were made.
   Waves cresting as high as 24 feet caused severe flooding in
southern <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION>, uncovering corpses in the cemetery in the town of
Inarajan, <ORGANIZATION>Booth</ORGANIZATION> said.
   Several large concrete utility poles installed after the last
major typhoon, <PERSON>Pamela</PERSON> in <DATE>1976</DATE>, snapped in half from the force of
the waves, <ORGANIZATION>Booth</ORGANIZATION> said.
   Russ damaged or destroyed only the few wooden homes remaining on
the island. Concrete structures built after <PERSON>Pamela</PERSON> escaped serious
damage.
   <ORGANIZATION>Ada</ORGANIZATION> said he planned to ask for federal disaster relief
assistance.
   Booth said the capital of <LOCATION>Agana</LOCATION> looked like a ``war zone,'' with
trees, traffic lights, poles and signs strewn about and flooding
everywhere.
   The storm center was out to sea and headed toward the
<LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION> with sustained winds of 145 mph and gusts of 175 mph,
<PERSON>Edson</PERSON> said. It was moving at 15 mph, but was expected to weaken
before it reached the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION>.

   Typhoon Koryn, packing
110 mph gusts, knocked down trees and cut electrical power in the
capital of this <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> commonwealth before moving away today,
authorities said.
   No serious injuries were immediately reported.
   The typhoon with maximum sustained winds of 85 mph swept past
<LOCATION>Saipan</LOCATION> and was moving to the northeast at 8 mph, said <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION>
Maj. <PERSON>Joel Martin</PERSON>, a meteorologist with the Guam-based <ORGANIZATION>Joint Typhoon

   As of <TIME>4 p.m.</TIME> (<TIME>1 a.m. EST</TIME>), <PERSON>Koryn</PERSON> was 65 miles north of <LOCATION>Saipan</LOCATION>,
<PERSON>Martin</PERSON> said.
   There were reports of downed trees and power lines before
communications were cut with <LOCATION>Saipan</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> said, but added the
storm's path ``seemed to have spared them a lot of the heavier
winds.''
   Forecasters predicted the typhoon would not affect any other
islands before it lost power.
   The winds damaged power lines, cutting electricity on the island
<DATE>Sunday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>, said <PERSON>Jean-Louis M. Pierrefeu</PERSON>, assistant executive
director for the <ORGANIZATION>Commonwealth Utilities Corp.</ORGANIZATION>'s power branch.
   As the storm approached, residents boarded up houses, put boats
to sea and moved to shelters, said <ORGANIZATION>Civil Defense</ORGANIZATION> coordinator <PERSON>Felix
Sasamopo</PERSON>. The airport was closed.
   Conditions on <ORGANIZATION>Rota</ORGANIZATION>, the most southern of the <LOCATION>Marianas</LOCATION>, were not
known because of poor communications, <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> said.
   The first island to feel the typhoon was <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION>, just to the south
of the <LOCATION>Northern Marianas</LOCATION>.
   Koryn skirted the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> territory to the west <DATE>Sunday</DATE> night with
heavy rains and 90 mph gusts, knocking out power and sending more
than 500 people to shelters. Without electricity, the island's
130,000 residents were without water.
   By tonight, electricity had been restored to at least <PERCENT>65 percent</PERCENT>
of <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> and <PERCENT>50 percent</PERCENT> of the island had running water, said <PERSON>Ben
Reyes</PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION>Guam Civil Defense</ORGANIZATION>.
   Island residents had been warned to keep a three-day supply of
water, <PERSON>Reyes</PERSON> said.
   All of the people who had sought shelter had returned to their
homes except for the 59 members of four families, who were provided
emergency housing, he said.
   Updated reports showed four people suffered minor injuries from
the storm, while the tin roofs of two houses were blown off, <PERSON>Reyes</PERSON>
said.

take it 57 miles north of <LOCATION>Saipan</LOCATION>.
   Before it stalled in the western <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION>, the storm had been on
a track that would take it between <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Saipan</LOCATION>, the capital of
the Commonwealth of the <LOCATION>Northern Mariana Islands</LOCATION> north of <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION>.
   ``The potential for erratic movement is high,'' said hourly
advisories issued by the center.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> sent B-52 bombers to <LOCATION>Okinawa</LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> ordered
its large ships to sea to ride out the storm, officials said.
   Banks closed today and the 125,000 residents of <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> and the

the strong winds, and the USS Haleakala was sent out to sea to
weather the storm, said Lt. <PERSON>Dave Lee</PERSON>. Three other warships were
allowed to remain in port, he said.
   The 12 planes at <LOCATION>Andersen</LOCATION>, including 11 B-52s, were parked
behind fortifications as the storm approached, said base spokesman
Capt. <PERSON>Wayne Perry</PERSON>.
   A tropical storm has sustained winds ranging from 39 to 73 mph.
A typhoon has a minimum sustained surface wind of 74 mph.

   Guam Gov. <PERSON>Joseph Ada</PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION>Internal Revenue Service</ORGANIZATION> soon will declare taxable a <MONEY>$300 million</MONEY> Guam housing-bond issue underwritten by <ORGANIZATION>Matthews &amp; Wright Inc</ORGANIZATION>. 

   Gov. <ORGANIZATION>Ada</ORGANIZATION> told a <ORGANIZATION>House Interior</ORGANIZATION> subcommittee he met with the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> last week on the bonds' tax status, and said, "They are coming out and declaring the <MONEY>$300 million</MONEY> (issue) taxable soon." 

   An attorney for <ORGANIZATION>Matthews &amp; Wright</ORGANIZATION>, a small Wall Street bond house, said he had no information on any <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> decision to tax the <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> bonds. 
A senior <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> official declined all comment on the matter. 

   The <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> bonds were issued as tax-exempt securities in <DATE>1985</DATE>.

   Residents waited behind boarded windows or
fled to shelters early <DATE>Friday</DATE> while <PERSON>Typhoon Russ</PERSON> battered the
island with winds topping 100 mph.
   There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage, officials
said.
   Russ was the strongest typhoon to hit this western <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION>
island in more than a decade. It toppled trees, pushed surf to more
than 20 feet high and made movement around the 30-mile-long island
virtually impossible.
   ``Everybody's just sitting tight,'' <ORGANIZATION>Guam Civil Defense</ORGANIZATION> spokesman
<PERSON>Mike Franquez</PERSON> said. ``We'll wait for the winds to pass and then
assess the damage.''
   About 145,000 people live on <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION>. The last storm to cause major
damage here was Typhoon Pamela in <DATE>1976</DATE>.
   Winds were clocked at 90 mph with gusts to 115 mph when the
storm made its closest pass before dawn, said <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> Capt. <PERSON>Dieter
Rudolph</PERSON>, commander of the <ORGANIZATION>Joint Typhoon Warning Center</ORGANIZATION>.
   The wind readings were taken at the typhoon center, near the
north end of north-south lying island. The storm's center brushed
<LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION>'s south coast, and southern areas were pummelled by the
strongest winds.
   The storm's maximum sustained winds were 145 mph, with gusts to
175 mph, <PERSON>Rudolph</PERSON> said. It was moving west-northwest at 13 mph.
   About 2,300 people went to shelters at schools. The windows of
most buildings had been boarded up, <PERSON>Franquez</PERSON> said.
   To avert the potential problem of dangling live wires if power
lines break, electricity was shut off to most of the island. Water
also was cut off. Some coastal roads were closed because the high
surf left them strewn with debris.
   ``There's downed power lines, downed trees, flooded streets,''
said <PERSON>Dave Ecret</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>KGUM Radio</ORGANIZATION>. ``It's just an eerie kind of
feeling.''

<HEAD>Executive Gets 18 Months in Mail Fraud Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Wall Street executive who pleaded guilty to
three counts of mail fraud for for allegedly bribing a former
governor of <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> has been sentenced to 18 months in prison.
   <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> District <PERSON>Judge Jesse W. Curtis</PERSON> on <DATE>Monday</DATE> also placed <PERSON>Arthur
Abba Goldberg</PERSON> on five years' probation, fined him <MONEY>$100,000</MONEY> and
ordered him to repay the <ORGANIZATION>United States</ORGANIZATION> <MONEY>$300,000</MONEY>.
   <PERSON>Goldberg</PERSON>, executive vice president of the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> bond
underwriting firm of <ORGANIZATION>Matthews &amp; Wright</ORGANIZATION>, pleaded guilty <DATE>July 14</DATE> to
three counts of mail fraud.
   He had been accused of funneling <MONEY>$70,000</MONEY> to former Guam Gov.
<PERSON>Ricardo J. Bordallo</PERSON>'s unsuccessful <DATE>1986</DATE> re-election campaign. In
exchange, <PERSON>Bordallo</PERSON> allegedly agreed to generate support for a <MONEY>$300
million</MONEY> housing bond issue underwritten by <ORGANIZATION>Matthews &amp; Wright</ORGANIZATION>.
   Bordallo was acquitted in <DATE>February 1986</DATE> of accepting bribes from
<PERSON>Goldberg</PERSON> but was convicted on 10 counts of government corruption.
He served as governor from 1975-79 and from 1983-87.
   <PERSON>Goldberg</PERSON> had faced a maximum 15 years' imprisonment and a
<MONEY>$750,000</MONEY> fine in addition to restitution payments, according to
<PERSON>William O'Connor</PERSON>, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> attorney from <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION>.
   The three counts referred to money bilked from the <ORGANIZATION>Guam Program
Development Fund</ORGANIZATION> and a ``lulling letter'' assuring fund authorities
that the transactions were legal.
   A <DATE>December 1987</DATE> indictment charged <PERSON>Goldberg</PERSON> with preparing phony
invoices that were sent to the bank entrusted with the fund money.
   The bank paid the money to <PERSON>Goldberg</PERSON>, who spent <MONEY>$25,000</MONEY> to buy
campaign paraphernalia _ including parasols, shirts and hats _ for
<PERSON>Bordallo</PERSON>'s unsuccessful re-election bid, <PERSON>O'Connor</PERSON> has said.
   Authorities said <PERSON>Goldberg</PERSON> made his contributions after <PERSON>Bordallo</PERSON>
was promised that he would receive campaign contributions if he
supported the bond issue to build homes. The bond was approved by
the <ORGANIZATION>Guam Legislature</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1985</DATE>. <ORGANIZATION>Matthews &amp; Wright</ORGANIZATION> has denied any
wrongdoing.
   In exchange for <ORGANIZATION>Goldberg</ORGANIZATION>'s guilty pleas, 46 other counts
alleging bribery, conspiracy, and wire and mail fraud were
dismissed. The case was moved from <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION>, 3,800 miles west of
<LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>, because of extensive pretrial publicity on the island.
   Twelve of the original counts against <PERSON>Goldberg</PERSON> were related
directly to <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION>. The balance referred to fraud involving the use
of the <ORGANIZATION>Commercial Bank of Americas</ORGANIZATION> in transactions that did not
involve the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> territory.
   In <DATE>August 1987</DATE>, Gov. <PERSON>Joseph Ada</PERSON> sued <ORGANIZATION>Matthews &amp; Wright</ORGANIZATION> for the
return of <MONEY>$14 million</MONEY> in fees the firm had received, as well as
<MONEY>$250 million</MONEY> in punitive damages. <PERSON>O'Connor</PERSON> said in <DATE>July</DATE> the suit
had been settled, but he released no details.

winds, slammed into the <LOCATION>Federated States</LOCATION> of <LOCATION>Micronesia</LOCATION> today,
killing two people and leaving more than 1,000 people homeless,
officials said.
   The two men were killed in the Micronesian capital of <LOCATION>Pohnpei</LOCATION>
when they were electrocuted by downed power lines, said <PERSON>Tony

   Early reports estimated that well over 1,000 people were left
homeless after the powerful storm packing winds of 125 mph and
gusts of 155 mph battered the outer islands of Pulap, <ORGANIZATION>Ruo</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Nomwin</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Fananu</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Murilo</ORGANIZATION> and Tamatam in the state of <LOCATION>Chuuk</LOCATION>, said <PERSON>Ismael
Dobich</PERSON>, public affairs director of <ORGANIZATION>Chuuk</ORGANIZATION>.
   Each island has about 500 residents. <LOCATION>Micronesia</LOCATION> is in the

groups include the <PERSON>Caroline Islands</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Nauru</LOCATION>, the <PERSON>Gilbert Islnads</PERSON>,
the <ORGANIZATION>Northern Mariana Islands</ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION>Marshall Islands</LOCATION>.
   Owen destroyed nearly every home on Pulap and <ORGANIZATION>Ruo</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Dobich</PERSON> said.
The entire banana, coconut, taro and bread fruit crops were
destroyed on <ORGANIZATION>Ruo</ORGANIZATION>, Dobich.
   ``In Pulap, all of the homes were destroyed with the exception
of one concrete structure,'' <PERSON>Dobich</PERSON> said. Most of the homes were
made of wood and tin.
   Owen was expected to regain supertyphoon status by late <DATE>Thursday</DATE>
or early <DATE>Friday</DATE>, with forecasters predicting winds of 150 mph and
gusts to 180 mph.
   <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION>, 1,488 miles from <LOCATION>Chuuk</LOCATION>, remains on a typhoon alert status.
Owen was about 405 miles south of <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION>, an American territory,

<TEXT>
   A federal judge today struck down <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION>'s
virtual ban on abortion as unconstitutional. The measure was the
nation's most restrictive abortion law.
   <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> District <PERSON>Judge Alex Munson</PERSON> declared that <PERSON>Roe vs. Wade</PERSON>, the
<DATE>1973</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> decision establishing the right to an abortion,
``applied with equal force and effect to <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION>.''
   The law, signed by Gov. <PERSON>Joseph Ada</PERSON> on <DATE>March 19</DATE>, banned abortions
except when the mother's life is in danger. But <PERSON>Munson</PERSON> on <DATE>March 23</DATE>
blocked its enforcement while he weighed a challenge to the law
from abortion-rights forces.
   The law carried a penalty of up to a year in jail and a <MONEY>$1,000</MONEY>
fine for obtaining an illegal abortion or soliciting a woman to
have an abortion. Performing an illegal abortion was punishable by
up to five years in prison.
   Two days after the law went into effect, an <ORGANIZATION>American Civil
Liberties Union</ORGANIZATION> lawyer, <PERSON>Janet Benshoof</PERSON> of <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, was charged
with violating the measure by publicly encouraging women to seek
abortions in <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>. The charges later were dropped; prosecutors
said the lawsuit challenging the law was a higher priority.
   The governor said he did not know whether he would appeal
today's ruling.
   ``I'm still very pro-life, and I believe that a fetus is a human
being and should be given life,'' said <ORGANIZATION>Ada</ORGANIZATION>, a Roman Catholic like
the vast majority of <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION>'s residents.
   The challenge to the law was brought by an unidentified pregnant
woman who wanted an abortion, the <ORGANIZATION>Guam Society</ORGANIZATION> of Obstetricians and
Gynecologists, the <ORGANIZATION>Guam Nurses Association</ORGANIZATION>, an Episcopal priest and
three doctors.
   <PERSON>Anita Arriola</PERSON>, a lawyer for the abortion-rights side, had argued
that the law _ introduced by her mother, territorial <PERSON>Sen. Elizabeth
Arriola</PERSON> _ was contrary to <PERSON>Roe vs. Wade</PERSON> and was passed to promote a
particular religious belief.
   <PERSON>Katherine A. Maraman</PERSON>, representing the government of this <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
possession in the <LOCATION>Western Pacific</LOCATION>, had argued that <PERCENT>99 percent</PERCENT> of
all abortions on <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> were not necessary but were for the
convenience of the mother.
   In his ruling, <PERSON>Munson</PERSON> said sections of the law are vague and
that the provision against soliciting an abortion violates the
right to free speech.
   <PERSON>Arriola</PERSON> said the decision ``sends a very clear signal to
<ORGANIZATION>Governor Ada</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Guam Legislature</ORGANIZATION> and other legislatures around
the country.''
   ``This decision means that <PERSON>Roe vs. Wade</PERSON> is still the law of the
land,'' said <PERSON>Lou Leon Guerrero</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>People for Choice</ORGANIZATION>.
   Dawn <PERSON>C. Leon Guerrero</PERSON>, chairwoman of the <ORGANIZATION>Guam Pro-Life
Coalition</ORGANIZATION>, said she expected the ruling, ``because the judge has to
follow legal precedent.''
   ``We figured that it wouldn't be an easy climb,'' said <PERSON>Roland
Rivera</PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION>Guamanians United for Life</ORGANIZATION>. ``There is
just the next higher level to pursue.''

   A federal judge on <DATE>Monday</DATE> extended a
restraining order against enforcement of the most restrictive <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
abortion law.
   <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> District <PERSON>Judge Alex Munson</PERSON> had issued a temporary
restraining order <DATE>Friday</DATE>, a few hours after a group of <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION>
residents and medical groups filed a class-action suit. On <DATE>Monday</DATE>,
he extended the order until <DATE>May 8</DATE>, when a trial on the suit is
scheduled to begin.
   ``We're very happy,'' said <PERSON>Anita Arriola</PERSON>, the plaintiffs'
attorney.
   The law prohibits abortions except when a pregnancy endangers
the life of the mother. It makes it a third-degree felony to
perform an abortion or aid in the procedure, a misdemeanor for a
woman to solicit or have an abortion and a misdemeanor for a person
to solicit a woman to have an abortion.
   The law in this <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> territory is seen by abortion opponents
as a potential vehicle to challenge the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Roe
vs. Wade</PERSON> decision that legalized abortion.
   The <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> law provides for a referendum in the <DATE>Nov. 6</DATE> general
election for <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> voters to decide whether to retain or reject the
abortion ban.
   <PERSON>Janet Benshoof</PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION>American Civil Liberties Union's
Reproductive Freedom Project</ORGANIZATION> defied the law <DATE>last Tuesday</DATE> when she
publicly encouraged women seeking abortions to have them done in
<LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>. She was charged in the territorial <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> with
solicitation to commit abortion, a misdemeanor.
   Among those named in the suit is Gov. <PERSON>Joseph Ada</PERSON>, who signed the
measure into law <DATE>March 19</DATE>.
   The plaintiffs include ``<PERSON>Maria Doe</PERSON>,'' a <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> woman who is eight
weeks pregnant and wants an abortion; the <ORGANIZATION>Guam Society</ORGANIZATION> of
Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the <ORGANIZATION>Guam Nurses Association</ORGANIZATION>, an

   The <ORGANIZATION>Coast Guard</ORGANIZATION> today called off a search for

on <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, but there was no sign of the crew, the <ORGANIZATION>Coast Guard</ORGANIZATION> said.

Lt. <PERSON>Bob Ritchie</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Coast Guard Rescue Center</ORGANIZATION> on this <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
island territory in the <LOCATION>Western Pacific</LOCATION>. He said the search was
called off today.
   The Marguarita I sailed from <LOCATION>Agana</LOCATION> on <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, even though it
was well known the typhoon was bearing down on the island, said
<ORGANIZATION>Coast Guard</ORGANIZATION> Lt. <PERSON>Jeffrey Lee</PERSON>, duty officer for the <ORGANIZATION>Joint Rescue

   The fishing vessel radioed its agent here late <DATE>Thursday</DATE> that it

   Communication with the boat was lost <DATE>Friday</DATE> when electrical
power went out on <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> as Typhoon <PERSON>Russ</PERSON> battered the island with
wind up to 150 mph.
   <ORGANIZATION>Federal Emergency Management Agency</ORGANIZATION> officials said the storm
damged or destroyed more than 2,000 homes and injured 88 people. No
deaths were reported.
   <ORGANIZATION>Guam Power Authority</ORGANIZATION> officials said they expected to have
electrical power restored to <PERCENT>60 percent</PERCENT> of the island today. Water
service remained disrupted in many areas because pumps were without
electrical power.
   Gov. <PERSON>Joseph Ada</PERSON> has asked President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> to declare the island a

   The fight to keep abortion legal on <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> is
being overshadowed in <DATE>Saturday</DATE>'s primary elections by the
possibility that the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> territory may have its first woman and
non-native governor.
   Gov. <PERSON>Joseph Ada</PERSON> is unopposed on the Republican ballot as he
seeks a second term.
   Democrats face a choice between <PERSON>Sen. Madeleine Z. Bordallo</PERSON>, a
native of <LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION> and widow of <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION>'s former governor, or former
Lt. Gov. <PERSON>Rudy Sablan</PERSON>. The winner will face <ORGANIZATION>Ada</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Nov. 6</DATE>.
   Guam's 21-member unicameral legislature unanimously approved a
bill virtually banning abortions <DATE>March 8</DATE> after <PERSON>Archbishop Anthony
Apuron</PERSON> threatened in a television interview to excommunicate any
Roman Catholic senator who voted against it.
   Ada signed the bill into law, saying: ``In my heart, I believe
that a fetus is a human being.''
   The law carried a penalty of up to a year in jail and a <MONEY>$1,000</MONEY>
fine for obtaining an illegal abortion or soliciting a woman to
have an abortion. Performing an illegal abortion was punishable by
up to five years in prison.
   Last week, <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> District <PERSON>Judge Alex Munson</PERSON> struck down the law
as unconstitutional. Munson declared that <PERSON>Roe vs. Wade</PERSON>, the <DATE>1973</DATE>
<ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> decision establishing the right to an abortion,
``applied with equal force and effect to <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION>.''
   Ada has not indicated whether he will seek an appeal.
   <PERSON>Mrs. Bordallo</PERSON> has said she also opposes abortion.
   <ORGANIZATION>Ada</ORGANIZATION> said he's running on his record of the past four years. He
said he is confident he and his running mate, Lt. Gov. <PERSON>Frank Blas</PERSON>,
will win re-election.
   On <DATE>Jan. 31</DATE>, <PERSON>Mrs. Bordallo</PERSON>'s husband, <PERSON>Ricardo</PERSON>, chained himself to
a statue, wrapped himself in <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION>'s flag and shot himself in the
head. That occurred less than four hours before he was to fly to
<LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> to begin serving a four-year prison term for witness
tampering and obstruction.
   Ada defeated <PERSON>Bordallo</PERSON> in the <DATE>1986</DATE> election after <PERSON>Bordallo</PERSON> had
been indicted on the federal charges.
   <PERSON>Mrs. Bordallo</PERSON> wants to be <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION>'s first woman governor and the
first governor who is non-Chamorro, the name for native Guamanians.
   ``Women are moving ahead today. They are leading countries.
Right next door, we have a housewife leading 60 million people,''
said <PERSON>Mrs. Bordallo</PERSON>, referring to Philippine President <PERSON>Corazon
Aquino</PERSON>.
   Some 130,000 people life on <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION>, an island about 1,500 miles
east of the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Mrs. Bordallo</PERSON>, 57, came to <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> in <DATE>1948</DATE> when her father accepted
a position as principal of <ORGANIZATION>George Washington High School</ORGANIZATION> here.
   <PERSON>Sablan</PERSON>, 58, served as Gov. <PERSON>Bordallo</PERSON>'s lieutenant governor from
<DATE>1974</DATE> to <DATE>1978</DATE>, unsuccessfully challenged <PERSON>Bordallo</PERSON> in the Democratic
primaries in <DATE>1978</DATE> and <DATE>1982</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Sablan</PERSON>, who also opposes abortion, said one of his priorities as
governor would be to set up a territorial tax structure that is not
tied to the federal tax system.
   The archbishop issued a pastoral letter published in newspapers
this week calling for voters to vote down pro-choice candidates.
   ``Like a modern day <ORGANIZATION>Pontius Pilate</ORGANIZATION>, a legislator or official may
attempt to wash his or her hands of abortion,'' <PERSON>Apuron</PERSON> said.
``However, the legislator cannot wash away the blood of the
innocents he or she has consciously declined to protect. Nor can
the voter sit idly by in apathy.''

   The governments of the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> islands of <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Saipan</LOCATION> filed separate damage suits against <ORGANIZATION>Matthews &amp; Wright Group Inc.</ORGANIZATION> alleging fraud and breach of contract in the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> bond firm's underwriting of huge bond issues there. 

   The suits, among a growing number of civil complaints against the Wall Street concern, seek <MONEY>$350 million</MONEY> in punitive damages and ask for a return of about <MONEY>$20 million</MONEY> in underwriting fees collected by <ORGANIZATION>Matthews &amp; Wright</ORGANIZATION>. 

   Filed in district courts of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> territories, the suits also seek additional damages for "injuries suffered" to both islands' economies, said <PERSON>Donald C. Williams</PERSON>, an attorney representing the islands. 
The suits also name <PERSON>George Benoit</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Matthews &amp; Wright</ORGANIZATION>'s president and chairman; <PERSON>Arthur Abba Goldberg</PERSON>, its executive vice president; <PERSON>Frederick Mann</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Toronto</LOCATION> businessman who served as an "authorized representative" in the bond issues; and a score of lawyers and consultants who helped package the bond issues. 

   <PERSON>Gerald A. Feffer</PERSON>, a Washington-based lawyer representing <ORGANIZATION>Matthews &amp; Wright</ORGANIZATION>, said, "We haven't seen the complaint" and therefore couldn't comment on the issue. 
In <LOCATION>Toronto</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Mann</PERSON> didn't return phone calls seeking comment on the suits. 

   As previously reported, both the <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> issue, for <MONEY>$300 million</MONEY> to finance low-income housing, and the <LOCATION>Saipan</LOCATION> issue, which was to fund <MONEY>$80 million</MONEY> in housing projects, are among more than 20 <ORGANIZATION>Matthews &amp; Wright</ORGANIZATION> bond issues under federal investigation. 
Many of the issues, all completed in <DATE>1985</DATE> and <DATE>1986</DATE> and representing about <MONEY>$3 billion</MONEY> in investments, are suspected of having been sham transactions designed largely to reap huge fees for the underwriter, federal officials close to the investigation have said. 

   In some cases, the underwriter is suspected of creating phony sales to beat a federal tax exemption deadline, and in others of coaxing municipalities into floating projects so huge and unrealistic that they were never viable. 
Investigators close to the case say that in some instances <ORGANIZATION>Matthews &amp; Wright</ORGANIZATION> is suspected of doing both. 
A number of grand juries investigating the bond issues, including one on <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION>, also are investigating suspicions that <ORGANIZATION>Matthews &amp; Wright</ORGANIZATION> in some cases made payoffs to selected public officials to win their support for the bond issues. 
Attorneys hired by <ORGANIZATION>Matthews &amp; Wright</ORGANIZATION> to conduct an internal company investigation have said they found no evidence of bribery. 

   The federal probe, as reported, extends beyond <ORGANIZATION>Matthews &amp; Wright</ORGANIZATION> to perhaps a half-dozen other underwriters and involves another 80 municipal issues representing an additional <MONEY>$9 billion</MONEY>. 
All of the issues are so-called arbitrage or escrow bonds, a controversial type of financing that since has been greatly restricted by <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>. 
Until projects could get off the ground, proceeds from such low-interest bonds could be invested in higher-interest instruments that would provide income to issuers, fees to underwriters and returns to investors -- whether projects got built or not. 
In some cases, the proceeds in escrow were invested in a way that would protect the bond investors should the projects be scrapped. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>, in <DATE>1985</DATE>, decided to severely curb arbitrage, arguing it gave issuers little incentive to complete projects and led to abuses. 
The congressional action set off a stampede of last-minute arbitrage bond filings in <DATE>December 1985</DATE> and <DATE>August 1986</DATE> in advance of two deadlines. 

   On both <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Saipan</LOCATION>, no projects have yet been built under the bond issues, something common to many of the <ORGANIZATION>Matthews &amp; Wright</ORGANIZATION> issues. 
The bonds were structured so that the proceeds in escrow were kept from developers, thus preventing the financing for the projects to get under way. 
As a result, local contractors with limited skills and few resources were left to raise huge amounts of money in the interim, a task most have found impossible, according to investigators who have looked at many of the <ORGANIZATION>Matthews &amp; Wright</ORGANIZATION> issues. 

   In their lawsuits, <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Saipan</LOCATION> allege that <ORGANIZATION>Matthews &amp; Wright</ORGANIZATION>, and its various consultants, breached promises and commitments to help obtain such financing, or misled local contractors about the availability or ease of obtaining financial backing for bond projects. 
The islands fear that the bond-issue problems might shut them out of the municipal credit markets in the future. 

   In a separate issue, the <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> suit also seeks to overturn an agreement between <ORGANIZATION>Matthews &amp; Wright</ORGANIZATION> and a <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> economic development agency that essentially limits the liability of the underwriter to <MONEY>$1.5 million</MONEY> in its preparation of the bond issue, shifting the liability to the government. 
The suit charges that the agreement represents an unauthorized "modification" to the original legislation authorizing the <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> bonds. 

   Guam is a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> trust territory of about 100,000 residents about 7,500 miles southwest of <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>; <LOCATION>Saipan</LOCATION>, a neighboring island, has about 20,000 residents and is the capital of a multi-island chain known as the Commonwealth of the <ORGANIZATION>Northern Marianas Islands</ORGANIZATION>.

   A senior <ORGANIZATION>Internal Revenue Service</ORGANIZATION> official refused to say if the agency is likely to issue more letters, such as those sent to <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Northern Mariana Islands</LOCATION>, specifying that certain municipal bonds sold as tax-exempt securities are not tax-exempt. 
But he said the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> is "not unaware" of a number of additional problem municipal issues. 

   "We just can't discuss anything we've got in-house," the official said, explaining that the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> is barred by law from discussing taxpayer matters, including municipal bond deals suspected or deemed to have failed the tests for tax exemption. 

   At the same time, he said the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> is "not unaware of a number of other bond issues" believed to have tax problems. 

   Former <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> tax attorney <PERSON>Joseph Krolikowski</PERSON>, now in private law practice in <LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> letters to <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Northern Marianas</LOCATION> "may open up a new era of the service quasi-publicly declaring bonds taxable." 
The <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> action is "a healthy development," he said. 
As previously reported, <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON>Lawrence Gibbs</PERSON> recently told the governors of the Territory of <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> and the Commonwealth of the <ORGANIZATION>Northern Mariana Islands</ORGANIZATION> that interest on <MONEY>$300 million</MONEY> of <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> bonds sold in <DATE>October 1985</DATE> and on <MONEY>$80 million</MONEY> of <LOCATION>Northern Marianas</LOCATION> bonds sold in <DATE>December 1984</DATE> "is not tax exempt." 
The agency concluded the bonds were arbitrage bonds. 
Both bond issues were underwritten by <ORGANIZATION>Matthews &amp; Wright Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, which said it believed the bonds were validly issued and are tax-exempt. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Gibbs</PERSON> said in his letters that the bond issuing agencies are entitled to a conference where additional facts or legal arguments could be presented regarding the tax status of the bonds. 
He further stated: "If desired, we will also consider whether there are good and sufficient reasons for finally resolving this matter through use of a closing agreement. 
Generally, under such agreements the service foregoes taxing the interest in the hands of the bondholders but collects all or an appropriate percentage of such lost revenues from the issuer." 

   Some lawyers involved in the matter, noting the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> letters set no deadlines for talks or for any closing agreement, speculated that the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> could let things stand as they are indefinitely, without actually taxing bondholders. 
However, there are clear indications the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> doesn't plan to let the matter remain pending indefinitely. 

   Some market participants following the slowly unfolding arbitrage bond saga said they expect a number of other "not-tax-exempt" letters to come from the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION>. 
They cited as leading candidates for such treatment the so-called <LOCATION>South Tucson</LOCATION> bonds, three bond issues totaling <MONEY>$368 million</MONEY> from three <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION> communities. 
Several market people said privately there are billions of dollars of questionable bonds sold earlier in the <DATE>1980s</DATE> that could warrant "not tax-exempt" treatment by the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> on the same grounds cited in the <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Northern Marianas Islands</LOCATION> letters.

<HEAD>Pacific Islands Representatives Seek Federal Aid to Combat Drug
Problems</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> territories told a
congressional panel <DATE>Thursday</DATE> that they have increasing drug
problems, and need the additional federal aid included in pending
legislation.
   The bill, introduced by Rep. <PERSON>Don de Lugo</PERSON>, D-Virgin Islands,
would provide training, equipment and money for <ORGANIZATION>American Samoa</ORGANIZATION>,
<LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>Northern Mariana Islands</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>U.S. Virgin
Islands</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Palau</ORGANIZATION>.
   De <PERSON>Lugo</PERSON>, who presided at the hearing as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>House
Interior</ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on insular and international affairs, said he
expected the legislation to become part of a planned comprehensive
drug bill this year.
   The legislation would provide <MONEY>$11.5 million</MONEY> in assistance in the
first year, and <MONEY>$5.5 million</MONEY> annually in subsequent years.
   Gov. <PERSON>Alexander A. Farrelly</PERSON> of the <LOCATION>Virgin Islands</LOCATION> said his
territory has become a major transit point for drugs moving from
<LOCATION>South America</LOCATION> to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> mainland.
   But the governor and <PERSON>Iver Stridiron</PERSON>, president of the <LOCATION>Virgin
Islands</LOCATION> legislature, said significant amounts of the drugs remain
in the territory and are causing a large increase in violent crimes.
   ``It really has our community under siege,'' <PERSON>Stridiron</PERSON> said. But
he added that with additional resources, the island territory could
become a model of combatting the drug problem in <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> territories.
   Farrelly said his major problem is resources, commenting that
the assignment of a single <ORGANIZATION>Drug Enforcement Administration</ORGANIZATION> agent in
the islands indicates either ``non-recognition of a serious
problem'' or lack of interest in solving it.
   Gov. <PERSON>Joseph F. Ada</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> said his territory is experiencing a
resurgence of heroin abuse after cleaning up the problem following
the <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> War.
   ``In <DATE>1985</DATE>, there was not one single case of heroin possession in
the territory of <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION>,'' he testified. ``In <DATE>1986</DATE>, 12 heroin arrests
were made by our police department.
   ``In <DATE>1987</DATE>, there were 108 cases of heroin possession, with 56
still pending laboratory analysis and confirmation. By any
definition, this is an alarming rise,'' <ORGANIZATION>Ada</ORGANIZATION> said.
   The governor said <PERCENT>91 percent</PERCENT> pure heroin from <LOCATION>Southeast Asia</LOCATION> has
been entering <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> through <ORGANIZATION>Palau</ORGANIZATION>. But after law enforcement
officers discovered the route, the drugs began coming to <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> via
the <LOCATION>Northern Marianas</LOCATION>, he said.
   Asked by de <PERSON>Lugo</PERSON> if he could put a cost on <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION>'s drug problem,
<ORGANIZATION>Ada</ORGANIZATION> said the law enforcement price tag could be <MONEY>$2 million</MONEY> to <MONEY>$3
million</MONEY>, but added the real cost could only be measured in trauma
and shattered lives _ not dollars.
   Responding to a question by Rep. <PERSON>Fofo I.F. Sunia</PERSON>, D-American
<LOCATION>Samoa</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Ada</ORGANIZATION> said he would fire anyone in his administration abusing
drugs with ``no questions asked.''
   A written statement submitted by <ORGANIZATION>American Samoa</ORGANIZATION> Gov. <PERSON>A.P. Lutali</PERSON>
said the ``most pervasive and growing illegal substance abuse
problem'' in his territory is marijuana, followed by cocaine.
   Referring to the marijuana problem, <PERSON>Lutali</PERSON>'s statement said,
``What 10 years ago was a situation involving a relatively small
number of individuals importing the drug through the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> mail has
now become a cultivation enterprises market by extended families
producing in excess of seven tons per year.''

   A <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> executive accused of pumping money
into the campaign of a former governor of <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> in exchange for a
political favor pleaded guilty <DATE>Friday</DATE> to three counts of mail fraud.
   <PERSON>Arthur Abba Goldberg</PERSON> entered the plea before <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> District <PERSON>Judge
Jesse Curtis</PERSON>, said <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Attorney, <PERSON>Bill O'Connor</PERSON>. In exchange
for his guilty plea, 46 counts alleging bribery, conspiracy, wire
and mail fraud, and violation of interstate racketeering statutes
were dismissed.
   ``In dismissing the counts, the <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> issues were dissolved,''
<PERSON>O'Connor</PERSON> said. ``Other issues are on the table if another
jurisdiction sees fit to follow through.''
   Twelve of the counts were related directly to <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION>, a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
territory since <DATE>August, 1950</DATE>, said <PERSON>O'Connor</PERSON>. The balance of the
counts related to fraud involving use of the <ORGANIZATION>Commercial Bank of
Americas</ORGANIZATION> in transactions that did not involve <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION>, <PERSON>O'Connor</PERSON> said.
   Although <PERSON>Goldberg</PERSON>, executive vice president of the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> bond
underwriting firm of <ORGANIZATION>Matthews &amp; Wright</ORGANIZATION>, only pleaded to three of the
dozen counts, <PERSON>O'Connor</PERSON> was satisfied with the outcome.
   ``<PERSON>Mr. Goldberg</PERSON>'s plea gave the same latitude of sentencing than
if he went to trial,'' <PERSON>O'Connor</PERSON> said. ``We, of course, will
recommend jail time and a heavy fine.''
   Goldberg faces a possible 15 years imprisonment, a <MONEY>$750,000</MONEY> fine
and restitution payments, <PERSON>O'Connor</PERSON> said in a telephone interview
from his <LOCATION>Santa Ana</LOCATION> office. Sentencing was scheduled in <PERSON>Curtis</PERSON>' court
<DATE>Sept. 11</DATE>.
   One of <ORGANIZATION>Goldberg</ORGANIZATION>'s attorneys, <PERSON>Howard L. Weitzman</PERSON>, said he had no
immediate comment. A receptionist who answered a call made after
business hours to another defense attorney, <PERSON>Bruce Hochman</PERSON>, said
<PERSON>Hochman</PERSON> had gone for the day.
   The three mail fraud counts concerned <MONEY>$57,500</MONEY> bilked from the
<ORGANIZATION>Guam Program Development Fund</ORGANIZATION> and a letter assuring fund authorities
that transactions were above board, while fraud was taking place.
   Goldberg prepared phony invoices that were sent to the bank
entrusted with fund money. ``The bank paid the money <PERSON>Goldberg</PERSON>
exerted for his purposes and ... he attempted to cover up later with
false papers in the files,'' <PERSON>O'Connor</PERSON> said.
   <PERSON>O'Connor</PERSON> said <MONEY>$25,000</MONEY> was ``used to buy campaign paraphernalia _
parasols, hats, shirts, junk like that'' for Guam Gov. <PERSON>Ricardo J.
Bordallo</PERSON>'s unsuccessful <DATE>1986</DATE> re-election bid.
   The funds were funneled to Bordallo after he was promised the
money in exchange for his support on a bond issue, <MONEY>$300 million</MONEY> of
which was sold by <ORGANIZATION>Matthews &amp; Wright</ORGANIZATION>.
   The bond was approved by the <ORGANIZATION>Guam Legislature</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1985</DATE>. <ORGANIZATION>Matthews &amp;
Wright</ORGANIZATION> deny any wrongdoing.
   Bordallo was acquitted in <DATE>February, 1986</DATE>, of accepting bribes
from <PERSON>Goldberg</PERSON> but convicted on 10 counts of government corruption.
   The case is among about 25 municipal bond deals nationwide
involving <ORGANIZATION>Matthews &amp; Wright</ORGANIZATION> under investigation by the <ORGANIZATION>Securities
and Exchange Commission</ORGANIZATION>.

FIRST CHARGES FILED TO TEST STRICT GUAM ABORTION LAW

Guam's attorney general, seeking a constitutional test of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> territory's 
day-old anti-abortion law, on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> filed a complaint against a <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> 
woman who had disseminated information here about terminating pregnancies. 
</P>
<P>
Guam's law, signed by Gov. <PERSON>Joseph Ada</PERSON> on <DATE>Monday</DATE>, is the most restrictive 
abortion legislation in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and has riveted national attention on 
this tiny <LOCATION>South Pacific</LOCATION> island. 
</P>
<P>
The law makes it a felony to perform an abortion even in cases of rape, incest 
and fetal abnormality. An abortion is allowed only if two independent doctors 
determine a pregnancy would endanger the life of a mother or gravely impair her 
health. 
</P>
<P>
It also makes it a misdemeanor to have an abortion or "knowingly solicit" 
pregnant women to have one. 
</P>
<P>
In the complaint filed in Superior Court here, Atty. Gen. <PERSON>Elizabeth 
Barrett-Anderson</PERSON> said that <PERSON>Janet Benshoof</PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION>Reproductive Rights 
Project</ORGANIZATION> of the <ORGANIZATION>American Civil Liberties Union</ORGANIZATION>, violated the law when she 
encouraged pregnant women seeking abortions to leave <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> for <LOCATION>Honolulu</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Barrett-Anderson had previously advised both the governor and the <ORGANIZATION>Guam 
Legislature</ORGANIZATION> that the abortion law was unconstitutional and said <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> that 
her action was designed to force a constitutional test. 
</P>
<P>
"My decision to bring a criminal charge under the new law will provide the 
basis for the courts to decide the question as quickly as possible. I believe 
this will be in the best interests of the government and of all persons 
affected by the new law," Barrett-Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
Voters in <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> have an opportunity to repeal the legislation in a referendum 
scheduled in <DATE>November</DATE>. The law was passed by the territorial Legislature after 
the archbishop of <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> had threatened to excommunicate those who opposed the 
measure, although most of the legislators said they were unaware of the threat. 
More than <PERCENT>90%</PERCENT> of the population on the island is Roman Catholic. 
</P>
<P>
In signing the legislation on <DATE>Monday</DATE>, Gov. <ORGANIZATION>Ada</ORGANIZATION> had insisted the law was a local 
issue. "I am not taking this action today to affect anyone's life in the 50 
states. I believe that this is a community issue and a community concern, first 
and foremost." 
</P>
<P>
But abortion foes and abortion rights supporters have seized upon the law as a 
possible test of the <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION>'s willingness to temper or undo its historic 
<PERSON>Roe vs. Wade</PERSON> decision, which guaranteed women a right to an abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Idaho and <LOCATION>Maryland</LOCATION> are currently studying abortion legislation, but the <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> 
law caught activists by surprise. Benshoof arrived in <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> over the weekend 
proclaiming that the new statute cannot coexist with <PERSON>Roe vs. Wade</PERSON> and likened 
the bill to a "<LOCATION>Pearl Harbor</LOCATION> for women." 
</P>
<P>
On <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> she acknowledged that she was breaking the law in providing the 
name, address and phone number of a <LOCATION>Honolulu</LOCATION> group that could help women get an 
abortion. The attorney general's complaint was filed <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME>. 
Benshoof's arraignment was set for today.

   Gov. <PERSON>Joseph Ada</PERSON> said a fetus is a human being
in signing a bill creating the most restrictive <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> abortion
statute, but abortion rights advocates already are challenging the
measure.
   <PERSON>Janet Benshoof</PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION>American Civil Liberties Union</ORGANIZATION> lawyer,
immediately violated the law by telling women in a speech where to
go to have an abortion, and the territory's attorney general _ who
personally opposes the measure _ pressed charges.
   Territorial Attorney General <PERSON>Elizabeth Barrett-Anderson</PERSON> says
prosecuting the case will be ``a heavy burden,'' but a
responsibility of her job.
   Benshoof made a court appearance <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> time, but
Superior Court <PERSON>Judge Ramon V. Diaz</PERSON> said he could not hear the case
because he did not feel he could render a fair and impartial
decision.
   Benshoof is scheduled to be arraigned today.
   The law, which passed despite a ruling by Barrett-Anderson that
it is unconstitutional, makes it a third-degree felony for a person
to perform or help in an abortion. Seeking or having an abortion or
soliciting someone to have an abortion are misdemeanors.
   The law also sets a referendum during the <DATE>Nov. 6</DATE> general
election for residents of this <LOCATION>Pacific Ocean</LOCATION> island about 1,500
miles east of the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION> to decide whether to keep the law.
   ``In my heart, I believe that a fetus is a human being,'' <ORGANIZATION>Ada</ORGANIZATION>,
the Republican governor, said in signing the bill, which prohibits
abortion except when the mother's health or life are endangered.
   <PERSON>Benshoof</PERSON> said she immediately violated a provision of the law by
advising women in a speech at the <ORGANIZATION>Guam Press Club</ORGANIZATION> later in the day
to go to <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION> to have legal abortions.
   ``I was very specific in my breaking of the law,'' <PERSON>Benshoof</PERSON>
said. ``The information that I gave, which is now a crime, came
from the <LOCATION>Honolulu</LOCATION> Yellow Pages.''
   Barrett-Anderson filed a misdemeanor complaint charging <PERSON>Benshoof</PERSON>
with violating the ban on soliciting someone to have an abortion.
Benshoof faces up to a year in jail and a <MONEY>$1,000</MONEY> fine if convicted.
   ``It's a matter of public record that I advised the <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION>
Legislature ... that in my opinion the bill was unconstitutional by
operation of the <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION>'s decision in <PERSON>Roe v. Wade</PERSON>,''
<PERSON>Barrett-Anderson</PERSON> said later in a statement.
   ``My advisory role has now shifted to one of enforcement. This
is a heavy burden, but ... I will enforce this statute to the
extent that the law allows.''
   <PERSON>Benshoof</PERSON>, who went to <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> to try to persuade Ada not to sign
the bill, was not arrested but appeared in court voluntarily.
   Guam's 21-member unicameral Legislature unanimously approved the
bill <DATE>March 8</DATE> after <PERSON>Archbishop Anthony Apuron</PERSON> threatened in an
interview with a television reporter to excommunicate any Roman
Catholic senator who voted against it. All but one of the senators
is <LOCATION>Catholic</LOCATION>, as is <ORGANIZATION>Ada</ORGANIZATION>. However, most of the senators said they
were unaware of the threat.
   Among those hailing the new law was the <ORGANIZATION>National Right to Life
Committee</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``This is great news,'' group spokeswoman <PERSON>Nancy Myers</PERSON> said in a
telephone interview from her <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> office. ``The people of
<LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> are largely pro-life as reflected by the unanimous vote in the
Legislature, and they have made a strong statement.''

   Four delegates were chosen today to represent
this <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> territory at the <ORGANIZATION>Republican National Convention</ORGANIZATION> and all
say they support Vice President <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON> for president.

<HL> Attorney Agrees To Cooperate In Guam Inquiry --- Strauss Enters Guilty Plea In Matthews &amp; Wright Municipal Bond Scandal </HL>

<TEXT>
   A key player in the <ORGANIZATION>Matthews &amp; Wright Group Inc.</ORGANIZATION> municipal bond scandal agreed to cooperate as a prosecution witness in a <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> federal grand jury investigation of a top <ORGANIZATION>Matthews &amp; Wright</ORGANIZATION> executive and a former company consultant. 

   The agreement was disclosed in documents filed in federal court on <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> by <PERSON>Edward K. Strauss</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION> attorney, who provided tax opinions on numerous <ORGANIZATION>Matthews &amp; Wright</ORGANIZATION> bond issues, and <PERSON>William O'Connor</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> attorney. 
<PERSON>Mr. Strauss</PERSON>, according to the documents, pleaded guilty to concealing knowledge of "cognizable felonies" allegedly committed by <PERSON>Arthur Abba Goldberg</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Matthews &amp; Wright</ORGANIZATION>'s executive vice president, and <PERSON>Frederick Mann</PERSON>, a Canadian who served as a <ORGANIZATION>Matthews &amp; Wright</ORGANIZATION> consultant. 

   In exchange for <PERSON>Mr. Strauss</PERSON>'s plea and cooperation, federal authorities pledged not to seek additional criminal charges against him unless he provides "deliberately false or misleading" testimony, <PERSON>Mr. O'Connor</PERSON>, the federal attorney, said. 
<PERSON>Mr. Strauss</PERSON>, a partner in the firm of <ORGANIZATION>Berkman Ruslander Pohl Lieber &amp; Engel</ORGANIZATION>, was said to be traveling and couldn't be reached for comment. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Strauss</PERSON>'s surprising guilty plea would appear to strengthen the government's case against Messrs. 
<PERSON>Goldberg</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mann</PERSON>, who were charged last month by a <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> federal grand jury in a 52-count indictment alleging fraud, bribery and obstruction of justice. 
The indictments stem largely from their handling of a <MONEY>$300 million</MONEY> housing bond issue on <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION>; an <MONEY>$80 million</MONEY> housing issue on the neighboring island of <LOCATION>Saipan</LOCATION>; and a <MONEY>$400 million</MONEY> bond issue for the island of Palau. 

   Those issues are among some 20 <ORGANIZATION>Matthews &amp; Wright</ORGANIZATION> bond offerings, representing about <MONEY>$3 billion</MONEY>, that are being investigated by several federal jurisdictions. 
Federal prosecutors suspect that many were bloated, sham transactions rushed to market by <ORGANIZATION>Matthews &amp; Wright</ORGANIZATION> to beat a federal tax deadline and generate huge underwriting fees. 

   In court documents filed as part of his plea agreement, <PERSON>Mr. Strauss</PERSON> stated that he "knew or had reason to suspect" that 13 separate bond issues allegedly bought by <ORGANIZATION>Matthews &amp; Wright</ORGANIZATION> were fraudulent transactions "conducted by <PERSON>Goldberg</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mann</PERSON>" using worthless checks processed through an unlicensed <LOCATION>Saipan</LOCATION> bank controlled by <PERSON>Mr. Mann</PERSON>. 

   Those issues -- representing about <MONEY>$2.1 billion</MONEY> -- include a <MONEY>$125.3 million</MONEY> <LOCATION>East St. Louis</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ill.</LOCATION>, resource recovery bond; a <MONEY>$223.7 million</MONEY> <LOCATION>East St. Louis</LOCATION> port development bond; a <MONEY>$200 million</MONEY> <LOCATION>Washington County</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pa.</LOCATION>, revenue bond; a <MONEY>$335 million</MONEY> <LOCATION>City of Chester</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pa.</LOCATION>, resource recovery bond; a <MONEY>$500 million</MONEY> <LOCATION>East Chicago Heights</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ill.</LOCATION>, resource recovery bond; and the <MONEY>$400 million</MONEY> Palau bond. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Strauss</PERSON> also stated that he knew or suspected that <PERSON>Mr. Goldberg</PERSON> had committed federal mail fraud in <DATE>January 1986</DATE> by submitting <MONEY>$57,500</MONEY> of "false or fraudulent" invoices to a <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> government agency for consulting services never performed. 

   The charge to which <PERSON>Mr. Strauss</PERSON> pleaded guilty is punishable by a fine of up to <MONEY>$500</MONEY> and three years in jail. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Goldberg</PERSON>, who has taken a voluntary leave of absence from <ORGANIZATION>Matthews &amp; Wright</ORGANIZATION>, will voluntarily appear on <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> next week where he is expected to plead not guilty to the 52-count indictment. 
His attorney, <PERSON>Stanley S. Arkin</PERSON>, said <PERSON>Mr. Goldberg</PERSON>, despite <PERSON>Mr. Strauss</PERSON>'s agreement with federal prosecutors, "steadfastly maintains his innocence." 

   Authorities have sworn out an arrest warrant for <PERSON>Mr. Mann</PERSON>, who has denied the charges against him. 

   An attorney with <ORGANIZATION>Williams &amp; Connolly</ORGANIZATION>, the law firm representing <ORGANIZATION>Matthews &amp; Wright</ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION>Matthews &amp; Wright</ORGANIZATION> continues to insist it engaged in no wrongdoing. 
"It's still the company's position they relied on <PERSON>Strauss</PERSON>'s counsel," he said.

   A federal grand jury on <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> returned a 52-count indictment against <ORGANIZATION>Matthews &amp; Wright Group Inc.</ORGANIZATION>'s executive vice president <PERSON>Arthur Abba Goldberg</PERSON> and company consultant <PERSON>Frederick L. Mann</PERSON>, alleging bribery, fraud and obstruction of justice. 

   Most of the charges stem from the roles of Messrs. 
<PERSON>Goldberg</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mann</PERSON> in the company's handling of a <MONEY>$300 million</MONEY> <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> housing bond issue in <DATE>1985</DATE>, <PERSON>William O'Connor</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> attorney, said. 
Some of the counts also relate to their handling of an <MONEY>$80 million</MONEY> housing issue for <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION>'s neighboring island, <LOCATION>Saipan</LOCATION>, and a <MONEY>$400 million</MONEY> issue for the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> island of <ORGANIZATION>Palau</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Mr. O'Connor</PERSON> added. 

   The indictments are the first to come from a wide-ranging federal criminal investigation -- believed to include at least five other grand juries in the mainland <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> -- of the tiny Wall Street bond house. 
The <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> bond issue is among more than 20 <ORGANIZATION>Matthews &amp; Wright</ORGANIZATION> municipal issues, representing about <MONEY>$3 billion</MONEY>, that federal authorities believe may have been sham transactions put together by <ORGANIZATION>Matthews &amp; Wright</ORGANIZATION> to beat a federal tax deadline. 

   Few, if any, projects have been built from the issues but they reaped enormous profits for the company and its principals while duping and defrauding some of the poorest municipalities in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>, officials close to these investigations believe. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Goldberg</PERSON> will be ordered to post a <MONEY>$1 million</MONEY> recognizance bond and report to the island on <DATE>Jan. 15</DATE> for a hearing in <ORGANIZATION>U.S. District Court</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Mr. O'Connor</PERSON> said. 
The court also has issued an arrest warrant for <PERSON>Mr. Mann</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>J.D. Moore &amp; Co.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Toronto</LOCATION> investment concern, and decreed that he be held in jail in lieu of <MONEY>$1 million</MONEY> bail. 
<PERSON>Mr. Mann</PERSON> is a felon convicted by Canadian courts in <DATE>1984</DATE> of swindling a dying widow out of <MONEY>$65,000</MONEY>, <LOCATION>Toronto</LOCATION> court records show. 

   Neither <PERSON>Mr. Goldberg</PERSON> nor <PERSON>Mr. Mann</PERSON> could be reached immediately for comment. 

   In the indictments, which don't name <ORGANIZATION>Matthews &amp; Wright</ORGANIZATION> itself, <PERSON>Messrs. 
Goldberg</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mann</PERSON> are accused of channeling <MONEY>$70,000</MONEY> in bribes -- part of <MONEY>$350,000</MONEY> in bribery offers -- to former <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON>Ricardo Bordallo</PERSON> for use in his <DATE>1986</DATE> election campaign in exchange for <PERSON>Mr. Bordallo</PERSON>'s approval of the <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> issue. 

   The indictments also charge that a substantial portion of the funds paid to <PERSON>Mr. Bordallo</PERSON> were illicitly diverted from a <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> government fund that had been set up by the island's legislature to support local developers' efforts to construct housing to be financed by the <MONEY>$300 million</MONEY> housing issue. 

   The indictments also allege that <PERSON>Mr. Goldberg</PERSON> supervised the billing of <MONEY>$27,500</MONEY> to the fund in the name of a non-existent company and in another case obtained a <MONEY>$30,000</MONEY> fund payment "for work which was not done." 

   <PERSON>Mr. Bordallo</PERSON> earlier this year was acquitted of bribery charges related to the <ORGANIZATION>Matthews &amp; Wright</ORGANIZATION> payoffs but was convicted on unrelated bribery and extortion charges in connection with business on <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION>. 
<PERSON>John Gilliam</PERSON>, a former aide to <PERSON>Mr. Bordallo</PERSON>, pleaded guilty in <LOCATION>U.S. District Court</LOCATION> <DATE>last summer</DATE> to a wire-fraud charge in connection with the <MONEY>$70,000</MONEY> bribery payment, records in <LOCATION>Guam U.S.</LOCATION> District Court show. 

   The indictment also alleges an "overarching scheme" by Messrs. 
<PERSON>Goldberg</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mann</PERSON> to obtain "more than <MONEY>$11 million</MONEY>" in fees for the company and themselves by a "complex wire and mail fraud scheme involving a number of small, financially unsophisticated <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> and stateside local jurisdictions." 
The indictment contends that the two men, by using an "unlicensed" bank on Saipan controlled by <PERSON>Mr. Mann</PERSON>, "bogus checks and bank accounts and world-wide wire transactions" promoted a "nationwide fraud." 

   In one example, the indictment charges that Messrs. 
<PERSON>Goldberg</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mann</PERSON> "willfully and knowingly" misrepresented the need for a <MONEY>$400 million</MONEY> bond issue for "undefined, speculative projects" on the tiny <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> island of <ORGANIZATION>Palau</ORGANIZATION>, which has 10,000 residents. 

   The documents allege that through a "series of bogus paper transactions" <PERSON>Mr. Goldberg</PERSON>, with the help of certain other <ORGANIZATION>Matthews &amp; Wright</ORGANIZATION> officials, duped the island's government into believing that its bond issue had been sold, when in fact it hadn't. 

   The indictment charges that certain <ORGANIZATION>Matthews &amp; Wright</ORGANIZATION> officials went to the extent of contracting with <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> computer concerns to print "bogus statements" aimed at convincing Palau officials that the bond transactions were legitimate and had taken place. 

   Also named, but not charged, in the indictment as "relevant" to the <ORGANIZATION>Matthews &amp; Wright</ORGANIZATION> scheme were: <PERSON>Edward K. Strauss</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> attorney for the company; <PERSON>George W. Benoit</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Matthews &amp; Wright</ORGANIZATION> founder and its chief executive officer; <PERSON>Roger J.

Zaccaro</PERSON>, identified only as a <ORGANIZATION>Matthews &amp; Wright</ORGANIZATION> employee; and <PERSON>Phillip J. Kieffer</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Matthews &amp; Wright</ORGANIZATION> consultant. 
None of those listed could be reached immediately for comment.

<HEAD>Guam Governor Signs Most Restricted Abortion Law in U.S.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AGANA, Guam (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. <PERSON>Joseph F. Ada</PERSON> today signed into law a
bill containing the most restrictive abortion legislation in the
<LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, and opponents pledged to fight to measure all the
way to the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``The question for me really boils down to one simple point,''
<ORGANIZATION>Ada</ORGANIZATION> said. ``In my heart, I believe a fetus is a human being.''
   The law prohibits abortions except when a pregnancy endangers
the life of the mother. The law makes it a third-degree felony to
perform an abortion or aid in the procedure, a misdemeanor for a
woman to solicit or have an abortion and a misdemeanor for a person
to solicit a woman to have an abortion.
   Although the bill is now law, it contains a clause calling for a
referendum on abortion during the <DATE>Nov. 6</DATE> general election, allowing
voters to decide whether they want to retain the law.
   Ada signed the bill before a room packed with dozens of abortion
rights supporters and opponents.
   ``My personal views on the subject of abortion have been stated
many times and should be, by now, fairly well known,'' <ORGANIZATION>Ada</ORGANIZATION> said.
``I do not agree with the practice of abortion, except in the case
of rape, incest and where the life of the mother may be
threatened.''
   ``It was outrageous that the bill was signed,'' said <PERSON>Janet
Benshoof</PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION>American Civil Liberties Union's
Reproductive Freedom Project</ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>.
   Benshoof arrived <DATE>Sunday</DATE> in this <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> territory in the western
<LOCATION>Pacific Ocean</LOCATION>, hoping to meet with <ORGANIZATION>Ada</ORGANIZATION> to discuss the implications
of the bill. The meeting never took place.
   ``I was devastated he was making a personal opinion,'' <PERSON>Benshoof</PERSON>
said. ``We all have a conscience. I believe he should be making the
decision for the people of <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION>.''
   <PERSON>Benshoof</PERSON> said she will remain on <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> for ``as long as it
takes'' and said she has no immediate plans to return to <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>.
   The unicameral <ORGANIZATION>Guam Legislature</ORGANIZATION> unanimously approved the bill
<DATE>March 8</DATE> despite an opinion from Attorney General <PERSON>Elizabeth
Barrett-Anderson</PERSON> that it is unconstitutional.
   It was amended before approval to provide the public referendum
on the abortion issue.
   The vote came after <PERSON>Archbishop Anthony Apuron</PERSON> threatened to
excommunicate any Roman Catholic senator who voted against the
measure. All but one of the 21 senators are Catholic, as is <ORGANIZATION>Ada</ORGANIZATION>.
However, not all senators were aware of Apuron's threat before the
vote.
   <PERSON>Rachael Pine</PERSON>, staff attorney for the <ORGANIZATION>ACLU</ORGANIZATION>'s Reproductive Freedom
Project, had said the <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> law, if approved, would give the <ORGANIZATION>U.S.
Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> the opportunity to decide the core issue of the right
to abortion.
   In a letter sent to <ORGANIZATION>Ada</ORGANIZATION> before the signing, <PERSON>Benshoof</PERSON> said the
case would be ultimately appealed to the <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Governor Ponders Restrictive Abortion Bill as Deadline Nears</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AGANA, Guam (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Abortion on demand would be illegal in this
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> territory if Gov. <PERSON>Joseph Ada</PERSON> fails to veto a bill passed
unanimously by the 21-member Legislature.
   Supporters of legalized abortion have started a campaign to
pressure <ORGANIZATION>Ada</ORGANIZATION> to cast a veto, while abortion opponents applauded the
legislation.
   ``Clearly the people of <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> don't want abortion on demand and
have made a clear statement on this,'' said <PERSON>Nancy Myers</PERSON>, the
<ORGANIZATION>National Right to Life Committee</ORGANIZATION>'s director of communications in
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>.
   Ada can veto the most restrictive abortion legislation in the
<LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, or sign it into law. If he does neither by <TIME>midnight</TIME>
<DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, it will become law automatically.
   Under the bill, abortion would be allowed only if a pregnancy
endangers a woman's health. Two independent doctors would have to
give their approval and their decision would have to be reviewed by
a committee appointed by the <ORGANIZATION>Guam Medical Licensure Board</ORGANIZATION>.
   The bill was amended before approval to provide for a referendum
on the issue in <DATE>November</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Janet Benshoof</PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION>Reproductive Freedom Project</ORGANIZATION> of
the <ORGANIZATION>American Civil Liberties Union</ORGANIZATION>, was to arrive here <DATE>Sunday</DATE> to
lobby against the bill.
   ``Our position is that the bill is patently unconstitutional,''
<PERSON>Rachael Pine</PERSON>, staff attorney for the project, said in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>.
``If the bill becomes law, we expect that it would be struck down
in the lower courts.''
   The <ORGANIZATION>ACLU</ORGANIZATION> is concerned that the measure could threaten the
landmark <DATE>1973</DATE> Roe vs. <PERSON>Wade</PERSON> decision which legalized abortion.
   ``Guam seems far away and only a territory, but passage of this
law could take Roe versus Wade away from women all over the
nation.''
   The Legislature approved the bill <DATE>March 8</DATE> after <PERSON>Archbishop
Anthony Apuron</PERSON> threatened to excommunicate any of its 20 Roman
Catholic lawmakers who might vote against it. However, not all of
the legislators were aware of the threat before the vote was taken.
   <PERSON>Myers</PERSON> said her group does not plan to send anyone to <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> to
lobby Ada to sign the bill.
   ``The people of <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> have spoken and we are not going to try to
foist anything on them like the <ORGANIZATION>ACLU</ORGANIZATION> is doing,'' she said.
   Ada, who is also Roman Catholic, has said the bill will have to
be thoroughly studied by legal experts before he makes a decision.
His deputy chief of staff, <PERSON>Mark Forbes</PERSON>, said the bill is ``a bit
more severe than the governor's personal view.''

   <PERSON>Arthur Abba Goldberg</PERSON> has taken a "voluntary leave of absence" from his position as executive vice president of <ORGANIZATION>Matthews &amp; Wright Group Inc.</ORGANIZATION> after his indictment by a <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> federal grand jury on charges of bribery, fraud and obstruction of justice, the company said. 

   The Wall Street bond concern also said <PERSON>Mr. Goldberg</PERSON> resigned as a director of the firm and its units and plans to "devote full time and effort to the defense of his case." 

   <PERSON>Mr. Goldberg</PERSON>, known on Wall Street as "Abba Dabba Do" for his aggressive deal-making, couldn't be reached for comment. 
But his attorney, <PERSON>Stanley S. Arkin</PERSON>, called the 52-count indictment against the 46-year-old <PERSON>Mr. Goldberg</PERSON> "factually and legally baseless." 
<PERSON>Mr. Arkin</PERSON> said <PERSON>Mr. Goldberg</PERSON> will plead not guilty to the charges at an arraignment on <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> during the week of <DATE>Jan. 18</DATE>. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Arkin</PERSON> also said the bribery charges against <PERSON>Mr. Goldberg</PERSON>, related to an alleged <MONEY>$70,000</MONEY> campaign payoff to <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION>'s former Gov. <PERSON>Ricardo Bordallo</PERSON> in <DATE>1986</DATE>, are "ludicrous" because <PERSON>Mr. Bordallo</PERSON> already has been tried and acquitted of related charges. 
<PERSON>Mr. Bordallo</PERSON> earlier this year was tried and acquitted of bribery charges related to payoffs but was convicted on unrelated bribery and extortion charges in connection with business on <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION>. 

   The indictments by the <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> grand jury <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> included allegations that <PERSON>Mr. Goldberg</PERSON> and <PERSON>Frederick L. Mann</PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION>Matthews &amp; Wright</ORGANIZATION> consultant, masterminded an effort to win <PERSON>Mr. Bordallo</PERSON>'s support for a <MONEY>$300 million</MONEY> Guam housing bond, which netted <ORGANIZATION>Matthews &amp; Wright</ORGANIZATION> huge fees but has yet to produce any houses. 
The indictments charge that the men undertook an intricate scheme in which they secretly funneled money -- some of it from a <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> government account -- into <PERSON>Mr. Bordallo</PERSON>'s unsuccessful re-election campaign in exchange for the governor's backing of the bond issue. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Mann</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>J.D. Moore &amp; Co.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Toronto</LOCATION> investment concern, called the charges against him a "manufactured situation" and accused <LOCATION>Guam U.S.</LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON>William O'Connor</PERSON> of "self-aggrandizement" in his handling of the investigation. 
<PERSON>Mr. Mann</PERSON> said that proof of that "self-aggrandizement" was the omission of <ORGANIZATION>Matthews &amp; Wright</ORGANIZATION> itself and its chief executive officer, <PERSON>George Benoit</PERSON>, in any indictments even though both had "full knowledge" of the <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> and other <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> island bond issues under investigation. 
<PERSON>Mr. O'Connor</PERSON> couldn't be reached for comment. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Mann</PERSON> declined to say whether he would voluntarily surrender to <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> authorities, and he wouldn't discuss other aspects of the case. 
A federal judge on <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> has ordered the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Bureau of Investigation</ORGANIZATION> to arrest <PERSON>Mr. Mann</PERSON>, a Canadian citizen, "wherever they find him" and hold him under <MONEY>$1 million</MONEY> bail. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Mann</PERSON> was convicted in <DATE>1984</DATE> of swindling a dying widow and longtime family friend of <MONEY>$65,000</MONEY>, <LOCATION>Toronto</LOCATION> court records show. 
Though <PERSON>Mr. Mann</PERSON> acknowledges the conviction, he said that it had been misrepresented by the press and he vowed to take legal action against those who have "misquoted or given a slanted version of the events." 
For that conviction, he was sentenced to three years in prison, according to <LOCATION>Toronto</LOCATION> court records. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Matthews &amp; Wright</ORGANIZATION> declined to comment on the indictment of Messrs. 
<PERSON>Goldberg</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mann</PERSON>. 
The company, in a prepared statement, said it "fully cooperated" in the <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> grand jury investigation, adding that "we think it is significant to note that neither the company" nor employees except <PERSON>Mr. Goldberg</PERSON> and the company's former consultant, <PERSON>Mr. Mann</PERSON>, were charged in the indictments. 
<ORGANIZATION>Matthews &amp; Wright</ORGANIZATION> added that the indictments were "limited to alleged unauthorized actions" of Messrs. 
<PERSON>Goldberg</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mann</PERSON>. 

   "We continue to believe that the company has conducted business in accordance with all applicable federal, state and local laws and that all underwritings were properly handled," the statement said. 

   The <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> grand jury, however, named several <ORGANIZATION>Matthews &amp; Wright</ORGANIZATION> officials, including <PERSON>Mr. Benoit</PERSON> and <PERSON>Roger Burns</PERSON>, its chief financial officer, as "relevant" to a far-flung <ORGANIZATION>Matthews &amp; Wright</ORGANIZATION> scheme that the grand jury said essentially allowed the company to fake <MONEY>$2 billion</MONEY> in so-called arbitrage bond sales to beat a federal tax deadline that made such transactions illegal. 

   The indictments allege that through a shell <LOCATION>Saipan</LOCATION> bank controlled by <PERSON>Mr. Mann</PERSON> and through a <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> credit union controlled by <PERSON>Mr. Goldberg</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Matthews &amp; Wright</ORGANIZATION> manufactured a series of "bogus transactions" that made it appear that certain bond issues had been sold when they hadn't. 
In at least one case, <PERSON>Messrs. 
Benoit</PERSON> and <PERSON>Burns</PERSON> signed "bogus checks" that were part of the ruse, the indictments state. 

   The indictments also state that <PERSON>Edward K. Strauss</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION> attorney, "helped the defendants" in part of their bond scheme by issuing a favorable tax-opinion letter on a certain <ORGANIZATION>Matthews &amp; Wright</ORGANIZATION> bond transaction, despite knowledge that the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> had expressed "serious concern" about the issue's tax-exempt status. 
Efforts to reach <ORGANIZATION>Matthews &amp; Wright</ORGANIZATION> officials for further comment were unsuccessful. 
<PERSON>Mr. Strauss</PERSON>, who wasn't indicted, was said by his office to be traveling and unavailable for comment. 

   As many as 20 <ORGANIZATION>Matthews &amp; Wright</ORGANIZATION> arbitrage bond issues, representing perhaps <MONEY>$3 billion</MONEY>, are under a federal criminal investigation. 
Under a form of arbitrage that now is largely outlawed by <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>, proceeds from low-yielding tax-exempt municipal issues could be invested at a profit in higher-paying instruments, such as <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> bills, until the proceeds were needed for projects. 
The issues were popular because they allowed underwriters to collect fees and municipalities to reap arbitrage profits, regardless of whether projects were ever built.

   <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> District <PERSON>Judge Alex Munson</PERSON> declared that <PERSON>Roe vs. Wade</PERSON>, the
<DATE>1973</DATE> decision establishing the right to an abortion, ``applied with
equal force and effect to <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION>.''
   Government attorneys and other defendants in the case argued the
law did not apply to <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> because of the island's status as an
unincorporated territory.
   The law, signed by Gov. <PERSON>Joseph Ada</PERSON> on <DATE>March 19</DATE>, banned abortions
except when the woman's life is in danger. But <PERSON>Munson</PERSON> on <DATE>March 23</DATE>
blocked its enforcement while he weighed a challenge to the law
from abortion-rights forces.
   ``The threat we live with is that the <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> has
indicated a willingness to overturn <PERSON>Roe vs. Wade</PERSON>,'' <PERSON>Kate Michelman</PERSON>,
executive director of the <ORGANIZATION>National Abortion Rights Action League</ORGANIZATION>,
said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>.
   ``If the governor appeals (<ORGANIZATION>Munson</ORGANIZATION>'s ruling) he will endanger the
rights of all women by providing the vehicle for the overturning of
<PERSON>Roe vs. Wade</PERSON>. Our goal is to keep these cases out of the courts,''
<PERSON>Michelman</PERSON> said.
   The governor said he did not know whether he would appeal.
   ``I'm still very pro-life, and I believe that a fetus is a human
being and should be given life,'' said <ORGANIZATION>Ada</ORGANIZATION>, a Roman Catholic like
the vast majority of <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION>'s residents.
   Abortion opponents say they were not surprised by the judge's
decision, adding the next step probably will be an appeal that
would send the case to the <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``We figured that it wouldn't be an easy climb,'' said <PERSON>Roland
Rivera</PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION>Guamanians United for Life</ORGANIZATION>. ``There is
just the next higher level to pursue.''
   ``<LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION>'s strong law ... could not be upheld without overturning
<PERSON>Roe vs. Wade</PERSON>,'' said Rep. <PERSON>Woody Jenkins</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-La.</LOCATION>, lead author of an
anti-abortion bill approved by the <LOCATION>Louisiana Legislature</LOCATION> but vetoed
by Gov. Buddy <PERSON>Roemer</PERSON>.
   ``Although it's not surprising that a federal district judge
would follow the Roe decision and rule against the <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> law, it
must be remembered that this is just the first stage in the
process,'' <PERSON>Jenkins</PERSON> said.
   ``What is important is that this decision be appealed all the
way to the <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> so that the highest court in the land is
given the chance to stop the killing of unborn babies,'' he said in
<LOCATION>Baton Rouge</LOCATION>.
   Munson's ruling said the law was unconstitutional because it
violated free speech and due process clauses of the Constitution.
   ``The ruling tells states they don't have the power to overturn
<PERSON>Roe vs. Wade</PERSON>,'' <PERSON>Simon Heller</PERSON>, an attorney with the Reproductive
Freedom Project of the <ORGANIZATION>American Civil Liberties Union</ORGANIZATION>, said in a
telephone interview from <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. ``But I doubt it will stop
legislatures from adopting similar laws. It's not like the <ORGANIZATION>Supreme
Court</ORGANIZATION> issued this ruling.''

   <PERSON>Arthur Abba Goldberg</PERSON>, executive vice president of <ORGANIZATION>Matthews &amp; Wright Group Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, was sentenced to 18 months in prison and fined <MONEY>$100,000</MONEY> for his role in a scheme to defraud a trust fund as part of a <MONEY>$300 million</MONEY> Guam bond issue underwritten by <ORGANIZATION>Matthews &amp; Wright</ORGANIZATION>. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Goldberg</PERSON>, who in <DATE>July</DATE> pleaded guilty in federal court here to three counts of using the mails to defraud the <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> trust fund of <MONEY>$57,500</MONEY>, also was sentenced to five years probation and ordered to make restitution of <MONEY>$300,000</MONEY> to the <LOCATION>South Pacific U.S.</LOCATION> territory. 
However, <PERSON>Mr. Goldberg</PERSON> would be eligible for parole after six months in prison, and the amount of restitution could be reduced under the sentence handed down yesterday by Senior <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> District <PERSON>Judge Jesse Curtis</PERSON>. 

   Known as an aggressive Wall Street dealmaker, <PERSON>Mr. Goldberg</PERSON> was indicted by a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> grand jury in <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> in late <DATE>1987</DATE> on 52 counts of bribery, fraud and obstruction of justice in what authorities had charged was a nationwide bogus bond scheme totaling <MONEY>$2 billion</MONEY>. 

   The 46-year-old <PERSON>Mr. Goldberg</PERSON>, a former <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> deputy attorney general, has been on leave from <ORGANIZATION>Matthews &amp; Wright</ORGANIZATION> since the indictment. 
Still pending are the <ORGANIZATION>Securities and Exchange Commission</ORGANIZATION>'s charges against him and others of fraud in connection with "sham closings" of more than <MONEY>$1 billion</MONEY> of municipal bonds in violation of tax rules in <DATE>1985</DATE> and <DATE>1986</DATE>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Matthews &amp; Wright</ORGANIZATION> and two individuals settled with the <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON>Mr. Goldberg</PERSON> was fighting the charges. 

   K. <PERSON>William O'Connor</PERSON>, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> attorney for <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION>, had sought a maximum penalty of 15 years imprisonment and a <MONEY>$750,000</MONEY> fine. 
But he said yesterday that the court had gone "into the matter with great care and the public interest has been served" by the sentence. 
An attorney for <PERSON>Mr. Goldberg</PERSON> declined to comment.

<HEAD>Federal Judge Allows Guam Women to Seek Abortions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AGANA, Guam (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge today issued a temporary
restraining order allowing women in this <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> territory to seek
abortions despite a law banning the procedure.
   The order resulted from a lawsuit filed by <PERSON>Janet Benshoof</PERSON>,
director of the <ORGANIZATION>American Civil Liberties Union Reproductive Freedom
Project</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Rachael Pine</PERSON>, staff attorney for the project, said from
<LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. Pine provided <ORGANIZATION>The Associated Press</ORGANIZATION> a copy of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
District <PERSON>Judge Alex R. Munson</PERSON>'s order.
   Munson scheduled a hearing for <DATE>Monday</DATE> at which he will decide
whether to issue a preliminary injunction against enforcement of
the law until the lawsuit is heard in court, according to Pine.
   The law prohibits abortions except when a pregnancy endangers
the life of the mother. It makes it a third-degree felony to
perform abortion or aid in the procedure, a misdemeanor for a woman
to solicit or have an abortion and a misdemeanor for a person to
solicit a woman to have an abortion.
   Gov. <PERSON>Joseph Ada</PERSON> signed the measure into law <DATE>Monday</DATE>. It was
unanimously passed <DATE>March 8</DATE> by the territory's Legislature.
   <PERSON>Benshoof</PERSON> was charged <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> with a misdemeanor charge of
solicitation to commit abortion after she tested the law by
advising women seeking abortions to travel to <LOCATION>Honolulu</LOCATION>.
   She pleaded innocent in <ORGANIZATION>Guam Superior Court</ORGANIZATION> and is free on her
own recognizance. Pine said if the judge grants the preliminary
injuction, the <ORGANIZATION>ACLU</ORGANIZATION> would have grounds to ask that charges against
<PERSON>Benshoof</PERSON> be dropped.
   Guam is an island in the western <LOCATION>Pacific Ocean</LOCATION> about 1,500 miles
east of the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
   Opponents of the most restrictive <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
abortion law are organizing in hopes of persuading voters in this
territory to overturn the measure in <DATE>November</DATE>.
   A court test of a section of the new law already was under way
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, less than 48 hours after Gov. <PERSON>Joseph Ada</PERSON> signed the
bill, which was unanimously passed <DATE>March 8</DATE> by the <LOCATION>Pacific Ocean</LOCATION>
island's Legislature.
   The law prohibits abortions except when a pregnancy endangers
the life of the mother. It makes it a third-degree felony to
perform an abortion or aid in the procedure, a misdemeanor for a
woman to solicit or have an abortion and a misdemeanor for a person
to solicit a woman to have an abortion.
   <PERSON>Janet Benshoof</PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION>American Civil Liberties Union</ORGANIZATION>'s
Reproductive Freedom Project in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, was to be arraigned
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE> on a misdemeanor charge of solicitation to commit
abortion.
   During a speech <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> at the <ORGANIZATION>Guam Press Club</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Benshoof</PERSON> urged
woman needing an abortion to travel to <LOCATION>Honolulu</LOCATION> for the procedure.
   ``I was very specific in my breaking of the law,'' <PERSON>Benshoof</PERSON>
said. ``The information that I gave, which is now a crime, came
from the <LOCATION>Honolulu</LOCATION> Yellow Pages.''
   Two investigators from the territorial attorney general's office
taped the speech, and Attorney General <PERSON>Elizabeth Barrett-Anderson</PERSON>
filed the charge later in the day. Benshoof faces up to a year in
jail and a <MONEY>$1,000</MONEY> fine if convicted.
   The attorney general had advised the Legislature before the vote
that the measure is unconstitutional. After the governor signed it,
she said, ``it is not my duty to decide the statute's
constitutionality but to enforce it.''
   A pro-choice group, Guamanians for Self-Determination, set an
organizational meeting for <DATE>Thursday</DATE> and pledged to fight the law.
The meeting was scheduled by about 35 women who met following
<PERSON>Benshoof</PERSON>'s speech <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
   The law sets a referendum for the 130,000 residents of this
island about 1,500 miles east of the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION> to decide whether
to keep the law.
   The issue of giving advice about abortions also was involved in
a federal appeals court ruling in <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>1st Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals</ORGANIZATION> ruled that a federal
regulation that prohibits government-funded family planning clinics
from discussing abortion with clients is an unconstitutional
infringement on freedom of speech.
   The court said the speech at issue involves telling a woman
about an activity ``in which she has a constitutional right to
engage.''
   Elsewhere, <LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION>'s state <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> put off until <DATE>Thursday</DATE> a vote on
what could become the most restrictive abortion law of any state.
Supporters and opponents expect the bill to pass. Gov. <PERSON>Cecil Andrus</PERSON>
has said he is anti-abortion but has refused to say whether he will
sign or veto the measure.
   A filibuster in the <ORGANIZATION>Maryland Senate</ORGANIZATION> against an abortion-rights
bill continued for sixth day on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>. The bill would allow
unrestricted abotions until a fetus is old enough to survive
outside the womb.
   In <LOCATION>Laredo</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>City Council</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Monday</DATE> passed a resolution
stating that life begins at conception. While a resolution is
merely an expression of the council's opinion, an anti-abortion
activist said he'll push for a city anti-abortion ordinance.
   Benshoof came to <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> on <DATE>Sunday</DATE> in hopes of dissuading <ORGANIZATION>Ada</ORGANIZATION> from
signing the bill. She was unable to arrange a meeting with the
governor.
   ``This is an issue that effects all women in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>,
not just <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION>,'' she said.
   Guam residents are <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> citizens but cannot vote in <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
elections. It has an appointed governor and elected legislature.

   Typhoon Percy battered the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION>
island of Palau and then roared <DATE>Sunday</DATE> toward the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION>,
where 30 people were killed in a tropical storm last week.
   One child was killed on <ORGANIZATION>Palau</ORGANIZATION>, a newspaper said.
   The <LOCATION>Manila</LOCATION> weather bureau reported at <TIME>5 a.m.</TIME> <DATE>Monday</DATE> that <PERSON>Percy</PERSON>,
packing 93 mph winds, was centered about 465 miles east of the
Philippine island of Samar.
   Percy was moving west-northwest at about 19 mph toward the
islands of <LOCATION>Catanduanes</LOCATION> and southeastern <LOCATION>Luzon island</LOCATION>, which were
expected to feel the effects of the storm late <DATE>Monday</DATE>, the weather
bureau said.
   Storm signals were raised over southeastern <LOCATION>Luzon</LOCATION> and the
central <LOCATION>Visayas</LOCATION> island chain, which includes Samar.
   In <ORGANIZATION>Palau</ORGANIZATION>, a young boy died <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> when he was swept by
rain into mangrove trees near his home in the cluster of islands
that comprise <ORGANIZATION>Palau</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Pacific Daily News of Guam</ORGANIZATION> reported.
   The storm passed 90 miles north of <LOCATION>Palau</LOCATION>, which is 800 miles
south of <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION>, according to the <ORGANIZATION>Joint Typhoon Warning Center</ORGANIZATION>.
   Wind gusts of up to 103 mph blew off tin roofs of many buildings
and knocked radio and television stations off the air, the <ORGANIZATION>Pacific
Daily News</ORGANIZATION> said.
   Airline flights into the republic were canceled, the newspaper
said.
   Earlier <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, the typhoon's winds battered <LOCATION>Yap Island</LOCATION> in the
neighboring <LOCATION>Federated States of Micronesia</LOCATION>, collapsing about 30
houses and damaging banana and coconut plantations, police said.
There were no reports of injuries on Yap.
   On <DATE>Friday</DATE>, <LOCATION>Typhoon Ofelia</LOCATION> swept over the eastern coast of <LOCATION>Luzon</LOCATION>,
the main Philippine island, then struck <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION>. Officials said at
least 30 people were killed in the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION> and at least seven
in <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION>.
   More than 84,000 people in the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION> were forced to flee
their homes because of flooding and landslides touched off by
<LOCATION>Ofelia</LOCATION>, officials said. Officials were still assessing damage to
crops and infrastructure.
   About 20 typhoons and tropical storms strike the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION>

<TEXT>
   A <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> judge in <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> on <DATE>Friday</DATE> blocked the territory's new
abortion law, the nation's most restrictive, and a legislative
package that would let <LOCATION>Maryland</LOCATION> voters decide the abortion issue
lost a vote and appeared doomed.
   In <LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION>, more than 50 junior high school students staged a
brief sit-in in the office of Gov. <PERSON>Cecil Andrus</PERSON>, protesting the
<ORGANIZATION>Legislature</ORGANIZATION>'s passage of a law that would ban more than <PERCENT>90 percent</PERCENT>
of the abortions performed in the state.
   They demanded that the governor veto the legislation, which was
approved <DATE>Thursday</DATE> and is the most restrictive abortion measure
passed by any state legislature.
   Pro-choice interests in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wisconsin</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Rhode
Island</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION> have threatened to boycott <LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION> potatoes
if <PERSON>Andrus</PERSON> fails to veto the bill.
   ``Women can fight back,'' said <PERSON>Anne Nicol Gaylor</PERSON>, administrator
of the Madison based-Women's <ORGANIZATION>Medical Fund Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION>Madison</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Wis.</LOCATION> ``We do not have to beg and plead for our rights any more.''
   Either the <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> law or the <LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION> law could provide the basis for
a direct challenge to the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION>'s landmark <DATE>1973</DATE> <PERSON>Roe
vs. Wade</PERSON> decision that legalized abortions.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Maryland Senate</ORGANIZATION> early <DATE>Friday</DATE> approved and sent to the <ORGANIZATION>House
of Delegates</ORGANIZATION> a complicated compromise to end an eight-day
filibuster on the abortion issue.
   But the <ORGANIZATION>House Environmental Matters Committee</ORGANIZATION> voted 13 to 12
against the package <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>.
   There had been a possibility that an attempt to revive the
proposal would be made on the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> floor, but because of <ORGANIZATION>House
Democratic</ORGANIZATION> leadership opposition, the committee action most likely
ends the matter for the <DATE>1990</DATE> session.
   <PERSON>John S. Arnick</PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Environmental Matters</ORGANIZATION>, told that
panel before he cast the tie-breaking vote that the leadership's
recommendation was to defeat both bills ``for the sake of the
system.'' He said the compromise involved a ``convoluted system
that doesn't make sense in a lot of ways'' and warned that ``the
public would be cursed with confusion.''
   Under the compromise, an abortion rights bill permitting
unrestricted abortions during the early stages of pregnancy would
have become law. Voters would have been able to call a referendum
on the law in <DATE>November</DATE> through a petition drive.
   If voters then rejected it in the referendum, then a bill
sponsored by anti-abortion senators would have become law _ unless
it also was defeated by voters. That bill would have allowed
abortions in cases of rape or incest, to protect the mother's life
or if the pregnancy would produce serious and adverse effects on
the woman's health.
   The compromise required that both measures be passed by the
<ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> and signed by the governor. If one of the measures was
rejected, the other one aldo would have died, but the committee
vote made all that moot.
   In <LOCATION>Agana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> District <PERSON>Judge Alex Munson</PERSON> issued a
temporary restraining order blocking enforcement of the territory's
new law, a few hours after a group of <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> residents and medical
groups filed a class-action lawsuit. He scheduled a hearing for
<DATE>Monday</DATE> on whether to extend his order.
   The plaintiffs included ``<PERSON>Maria Doe</PERSON>,'' a <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> woman who is eight
weeks pregnant and wants an abortion, the <ORGANIZATION>Guam Society</ORGANIZATION> of
Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the <ORGANIZATION>Guam Nurses Association</ORGANIZATION>, an
Episcopal priest and three doctors.
   Defendants include Gov. <PERSON>Joseph Ada</PERSON>, who signed the bill into law
<DATE>Monday</DATE>, and territorial Attorney General <PERSON>Elizabeth
Barrett-Anderson</PERSON>, who advised the Legislature that the bill was
unconstitutional before it was approved.
   <PERSON>Rachael Pine</PERSON>, staff attorney for the <ORGANIZATION>American Civil Liberties
Union</ORGANIZATION>'s Reproductive Freedom Project in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, said the lawsuit
cites violation of constitutional guarantees of right to privacy,
due process, free speech, equal protection, guarantees of religious
freedoms and freedom from slavery.
   Guam's law prohibits abortions except when a pregnancy endangers
the life of the mother. It makes it a felony to perform abortion or
aid in the procedure, and a misdemeanor for a woman to solicit or
have an abortion, or for a person to solicit a woman to have an
abortion.
   The law provides for a referendum on the <DATE>Nov. 6</DATE> ballot for <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION>
voters to decide whether to retain or reject the law.
   Guam's law is more restrictive than the bill passed by the <LOCATION>Idaho
Legislature</LOCATION>.
   The <LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION> bill would ban abortion except in cases of
non-statutory rape reported within seven days, incest if the victim
is younger than 18, severe fetal deformity or threat to the
mother's life or physical health. It would ban more than <PERCENT>90 percent</PERCENT>
of the 1,500 abortions performed in <LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION> annually.
   ``<LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION> was one of the first states to give women their rights,
and now they want to take them away from us,'' said 15-year-old
<PERSON>Michele May</PERSON>, one of those protesting at the governor's office in
<LOCATION>Boise</LOCATION>. ``We can't let them do that.''
   If <PERSON>Andrus</PERSON> signs the bill, the law would take effect <DATE>July 1</DATE>, and
abortion rights groups have promised a quick court challenge. The
governor has not said what he would do.
   In <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION>'s congressional delegate worked to
head off retaliation from colleagues resulting from the abortion
law.
   Rep. <PERSON>George Miller</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-Calif.</LOCATION>, sent a letter to colleagues
<DATE>Thursday</DATE>, urging them to withdraw support for a bill to provide
commonwealth status for <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION>.
   ``States and territories may have the right to pass laws that
deny women the right to choice, but no government has the right to
deny its citizens freedom of speech,'' <PERSON>Miller</PERSON>'s letter said.

<HL> U.S. Investigating Bribery Allegations
Against Matthews &amp; Wright Bond Unit

   Federal authorities are now investigating allegations that <ORGANIZATION>Matthews &amp; Wright Group Inc.</ORGANIZATION>'s municipal bond subsidiary systematically made hundreds of thousands of dollars in illegal payments to certain public officials to influence them to approve a number of questionable bond issues. 

   The authorities also are investigating the allegedly fraudulent inflating of <ORGANIZATION>Matthews &amp; Wright</ORGANIZATION>'s stock because of its earnings from fees generated in the bond issues, which the company underwrote. 

   Officials at the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Bureau of Investigation</ORGANIZATION> and various <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> attorney's offices said they are probing complaints by businessmen in the various locations that the municipal bond unit bribed officials to help win approval of the bond issues, which already are being studied by federal regulators for their tax-exempt status. 

   The investigators are focusing on a <MONEY>$300 million</MONEY> issue for <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION>; an <MONEY>$80 million</MONEY> issue for its neighboring island, <LOCATION>Saipan</LOCATION>; and two issues totaling <MONEY>$350 million</MONEY> for <LOCATION>East St. Louis</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ill</LOCATION>. 
Investigators said other issues underwritten by the subsidiary, known as <ORGANIZATION>Matthews &amp; Wright Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, may also be involved. 

   In a class-action suit filed against <ORGANIZATION>Matthews &amp; Wright</ORGANIZATION> last month in <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> District Court in <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION>, investors alleged, among other things, that a former <MONEY>$20,000-a-year</MONEY> assistant solicitor for the city of <LOCATION>Chester</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pa.</LOCATION>, had received a <MONEY>$350,000</MONEY> fee as "special counsel" to the underwriter for a <MONEY>$335 million</MONEY> bond issue there. 
The suit charged that the former official was "instrumental" in getting <ORGANIZATION>Matthews &amp; Wright</ORGANIZATION> selected as the sole underwriter for the bond issue. 

   In some cases, the payment of bribes together with high-pressure tactics were the company's "modus operandi," said an <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> agent familiar with the case. 

   Separately, federal law enforcement officials are also seeking to determine whether <ORGANIZATION>Matthews &amp; Wright</ORGANIZATION> violated federal securities laws in connection with the company's initial public offering of stock in <DATE>1986</DATE>. 
The focus of the inquiry is whether an avalanche of questionable tax-exempt bond sales, including the <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Saipan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>East St. Louis</LOCATION> issues, were part of a ploy to fatten earnings through fees, and thus pump up the value of <ORGANIZATION>Matthews &amp; Wright</ORGANIZATION> shares, at the time of the public offering in <DATE>August 1986</DATE>. 

   Officials of <ORGANIZATION>New York-based Matthews &amp; Wright</ORGANIZATION> didn't return repeated phone calls seeking comment. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Matthews &amp; Wright</ORGANIZATION> went public with 1.5 million shares at <MONEY>$11</MONEY> a share, and its stock has traded as high as <MONEY>$13.58</MONEY>. 
However, the company's shares have sunk following reports of investigations that could lead to a challenge of the tax-exempt status of dozens of <ORGANIZATION>Matthews &amp; Wright</ORGANIZATION> bond issues. 
The company's shares closed yesterday at <MONEY>$3</MONEY>, down <MONEY>12.5 cents</MONEY>, in <ORGANIZATION>American Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> trading. 

   Those issues are among as many as 100 municipal issues, involving as much as <MONEY>$12 billion</MONEY>, that appear to have been rushed to completion by <ORGANIZATION>Matthews &amp; Wright</ORGANIZATION> and other firms in advance of <DATE>1986</DATE> federal tax legislation greatly restricting the practice of "arbitraging" bonds. 
In such situations, the issuers of the bonds, while deciding how and when to use the proceeds for the intended public works projects, invest them at a rate higher than the low rate they paid to borrow the funds, thus earning a profit on the difference in interest rates. 

   Investigators are probing charges, brought in at least one investor lawsuit, that some of those issues were merely sham transactions to beat the arbitrage deadline of <DATE>Aug. 31, 1986</DATE>. 

   In other cases, investigators are probing complaints that underwriters vastly inflated project needs under the bond issues, reaping enormous fees in the process. 
As previously reported, federal regulators are believed to be investigating whether the bond sales actually were completed in time to meet a tax-exemption deadline, and whether the projects to be financed were ever economically viable. 
The size of bond issues generally are reached by agreement of the municipalities and underwriters, usually after some sort of study of the need for the project to be financed. 

   At the same time, many of the issues are structured so that the bond proceeds are locked into escrow accounts and away from developers who were depending on them for payment. 
The developers would then have to find their own interim financing. 
In some cases, the proceeds in escrow were invested in annuities designed to protect the bond investors should the projects be scrapped. 

   "The idea was to generate fees. 
There weren't supposed to be any projects," said one federal investigator familiar with the case. 

   In the case of <ORGANIZATION>Matthews &amp; Wright</ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Saipan</LOCATION> issues alone, for example, earned the company fees of about <MONEY>$20 million</MONEY>. 
Yet governments on both islands are now pessimistic that the projects, to provide low-income and moderate-income housing, will ever be built, largely because of financing problems encountered by project contractors who expected to be paid through the bond proceeds. 

   Guam business officials, who played some part in formulating project estimates with the public officials and <PERSON>Matthews</PERSON>, now estimate that <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION>'s foreseeable housing needs are probably less than half the 3,700 units proposed for construction under the <MONEY>$300 million</MONEY> bond sale. 
On <LOCATION>Saipan</LOCATION>, local contractors say that island's housing needs could be met for about a tenth of the <MONEY>$80 million</MONEY> bond issue. 

   The governments of <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Saipan</LOCATION>, both <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> trust territories, have launched their own investigations of the issues and say they are considering filing lawsuits to rescind the bonds and recover underwriting fees. 
<PERSON>Eric Smith</PERSON>, an assistant <LOCATION>Saipan</LOCATION> attorney general, said the local government also may pursue an investigation of possible collusion among local officials and <PERSON>Matthews</PERSON>. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Matthews &amp; Wright</ORGANIZATION> also handled a <MONEY>$300 million</MONEY> industrial bond issue for the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> island of <ORGANIZATION>Palau</ORGANIZATION>. 
That issue, which also is under federal scrutiny, is in limbo. 

   "Let's put it this way," said a federal official close to the investigation. 
"Palau has 7,000 people, its government is on the brink of bankruptcy and its cash crop is marijuana. 
You tell me how they were going to spend <MONEY>$300 million</MONEY>." 

   In their investigation of alleged bribes, investigators are known to be focusing on the roles of <PERSON>Arthur Abba Goldberg</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Matthews &amp; Wright</ORGANIZATION>'s 45-year-old executive vice president, and <PERSON>Frederick Mann</PERSON>, who is identified in court documents as <ORGANIZATION>Matthews &amp; Wright</ORGANIZATION>'s "authorized representative." 

   In <ORGANIZATION>U.S. District Court</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Goldberg</PERSON> is named in recent court documents as having authorized <PERSON>Mr. Mann</PERSON> to channel <MONEY>$70,000</MONEY> to the campaign of former <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON>Ricardo J. Bordallo</PERSON> in exchange for <PERSON>Mr. Bordallo</PERSON>'s approval of the <MONEY>$300 million</MONEY> <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> bond issue. 

   Messrs. 
<PERSON>Goldberg</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mann</PERSON> were identified in an affidavit filed in support of a guilty plea by <PERSON>John Gilliam</PERSON>, an aide to <PERSON>Mr. Bordallo</PERSON>, to a wire fraud charge in connection with the payoffs. 
<PERSON>Mr. Bordallo</PERSON>, however, earlier this year was acquitted of five counts of bribery related to the <ORGANIZATION>Matthews &amp; Wright</ORGANIZATION> money. 
He was found guilty in federal court of other, unrelated bribery and extortion charges in connection with business on <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION>. 
He was defeated for re-election last <DATE>November</DATE> and is appealing his conviction. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Mann</PERSON> is president of <ORGANIZATION>J.D. Moore &amp; Co.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Toronto</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>, investment concern. 
<PERSON>Mr. Mann</PERSON>, according to records obtained from <LOCATION>Saipan</LOCATION>'s office of corporations, controls <ORGANIZATION>Commercial Bank</ORGANIZATION> of the Americas, an offshore bank on <LOCATION>Saipan</LOCATION> through which <MONEY>hundreds of millions of dollars</MONEY> of <ORGANIZATION>Matthews &amp; Wright</ORGANIZATION> bond proceeds flowed. 

   However, the records show that the government declined to renew <PERSON>Mr. Mann</PERSON>'s banking license in <DATE>1985</DATE> after officials learned that he had failed to reveal an <DATE>April 1984</DATE> fraud conviction in <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>. 

   Federal investigators now say they believe several other unnamed <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Saipan</LOCATION> officials accepted cash, bogus loans or payments for questionable consulting contracts in exchange for giving their approval to the <ORGANIZATION>Matthews &amp; Wright</ORGANIZATION> bond issues. 
Investigators are also known to be looking into similar allegations against at least one public official in the <LOCATION>East St. Louis</LOCATION> bond issue. 

   Authorities investigating the <ORGANIZATION>Matthews &amp; Wright</ORGANIZATION> bond issues have rejected any nationwide task force, despite the geographical breadth of the issues in question. 
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> attorneys' offices and companion agencies in at least six locations, including <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION>, are conducting separate but closely linked investigations, federal agents and officials said. 

   <PERSON>William O'Connor</PERSON>, <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> attorney for the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> island region, declined to comment except to say that separate grand juries on <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Saipan</LOCATION> would be empaneled to investigate the allegations.

A federal judge <DATE>Thursday</DATE> overturned the nation's most restrictive abortion law, 
and abortion rights supporters said an appeal of that ruling would threaten the 
<ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION>'s landmark <PERSON>Roe vs. Wade</PERSON> decision. 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> District <PERSON>Judge Alex Munson</PERSON> declared that <PERSON>Roe vs. Wade</PERSON>, the <DATE>1973</DATE> decision 
establishing the right to an abortion, "applied with equal force and effect to 
<LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION>." 
</P>
<P>
Government attorneys and other defendants in the case argued that the law did 
not apply to <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> because of the island's status as an unincorporated 
territory. 
</P>
<P>
The law, signed by Gov. <PERSON>Joseph Ada</PERSON> on <DATE>March 19</DATE>, banned abortions except when 
the woman's life is in danger. It did not permit abortions in the case of rape 
or incest and made it a crime for someone to advise a woman about an abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Munson on <DATE>March 23</DATE> blocked enforcement of the law while he weighed a challenge 
from abortion rights forces. 
</P>
<P>
"The threat we live with is that the <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> has indicated a willingness 
to overturn <PERSON>Roe vs. Wade</PERSON>," <PERSON>Kate Michelman</PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION>National 
Abortion Rights Action League</ORGANIZATION>, said in a phone interview from <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"If the governor appeals (<ORGANIZATION>Munson</ORGANIZATION>'s ruling), he will endanger the rights of all 
women by providing the vehicle for the overturning of <PERSON>Roe vs. Wade</PERSON>. Our goal is 
to keep these cases out of the courts," <PERSON>Michelman</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
The governor said he did not know whether he would appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Abortion opponents said that they were not surprised by the judge's decision 
and that the next step probably will be an appeal that would send the case to 
the <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"We figured that it wouldn't be an easy climb," said <PERSON>Roland Rivera</PERSON>, vice 
president of <ORGANIZATION>Guamanians United for Life</ORGANIZATION>. "There is just the next higher level 
to pursue." 
</P>
<P>
"<LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION>'s strong law . . . could not be upheld without overturning <PERSON>Roe vs. Wade</PERSON>," 
said state Rep. <PERSON>Woody Jenkins</PERSON>, lead author of an anti-abortion bill approved by 
the <LOCATION>Louisiana Legislature</LOCATION> but vetoed by Gov. Buddy <PERSON>Roemer</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
"Although it's not surprising that a federal district judge would follow the 
Roe decision and rule against the <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> law, it must be remembered that this is 
just the first stage in the process," <PERSON>Jenkins</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
Munson's ruling said the law was unconstitutional because it violated the free 
speech and due process clauses of the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
"The ruling tells states they don't have the power to overturn <PERSON>Roe vs. Wade</PERSON>," 
<PERSON>Simon Heller</PERSON>, an attorney with the Reproductive Freedom Project of the <ORGANIZATION>American 
Civil Liberties Union</ORGANIZATION>, said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>.

<DATELINE>AGANA, Guam (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hours before he was to leave the island to
begin a prison term, a former two-term governor of <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> chained
himself to a public statue, wrapped himself in <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION>'s flag and
fatally shot himself in the head.
   Found at the base of the statue were four handwritten placards,
one of which said, ``I regret I only have one life to give for my
island,'' according to police Lt. <PERSON>Phil Dennis</PERSON>.
   Former Gov. <PERSON>Ricardo</PERSON> ``Ricky'' <PERSON>Bordallo</PERSON>, 62, shot himself
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE> less than four hours before he was to fly to <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>,
where he was to visit his daughter before reporting to the federal
correctional facility at <LOCATION>Boron</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, to begin a four-year prison
term for witness tampering and obstruction.
   ``I choose death before dishonor,'' <PERSON>Bordallo</PERSON> wrote on another
placard. ``My loving wife ... has my message which she will impart
to the people of <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> in due time.''
   An aide to his wife, territorial <PERSON>Sen. Madeleine Bordallo</PERSON>, said
the senator had not found such a message.
   Reporters who attended a farewell party for <PERSON>Bordallo</PERSON> earlier in
the day said he had appeared to be in good spirits.
   ``I didn't think this would happen,'' Congressional Del. <PERSON>Ben
Blaz</PERSON> said from <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>. ``<PERSON>Ricky Bordallo</PERSON> always seemed to bounce
back from his many adversities.''
   At a busy downtown intersection, <PERSON>Bordallo</PERSON> shot himself with a
.38-caliber pistol while chained to the statue of Chief Quipuha,
the first chief in <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> to adopt Christianity, <PERSON>Dennis</PERSON> said.
   He died a short time later of massive brain damage, according to
a spokesman at the <ORGANIZATION>Guam Naval Hospital</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>Mrs. Bordallo</PERSON> was
reportedly with him when he died.
   Territorial flags were lowered to half-staff, and Gov. <PERSON>Joseph
Ada</PERSON> declared a state of mourning until after <PERSON>Bordallo</PERSON>'s funeral,
which is yet to be scheduled.
   Bordallo told the <ORGANIZATION>Pacific Daily News</ORGANIZATION> in an interview last <DATE>Friday</DATE>
that he was facing his prison term with ``complete serenity.''
   ``When a man is innocent, his conscience is clear, and he is at
peace with himself,'' <PERSON>Bordallo</PERSON> said.
   But he also said: ``My own instincts make me believe that I will
not be coming back from Boron alive. I'm not dwelling on how it
will happen. I will be in the hands of people who are masters of
intrigue.''
   Bordallo was found guilty in <DATE>February 1987</DATE> of getting engineer
<PERSON>Johnny Carpio</PERSON> to lie to federal officials about a <MONEY>$60,000</MONEY> political
contribution from a group of Japanese businessmen.
   During his trial, <PERSON>Bordallo</PERSON> admitted accepting money from the
businessmen, but contended the money was a campaign contribution.
   Carpio was convicted of extortion and bribery and was placed on
five years' probation.
   Bordallo, a Democrat, served as governor from <DATE>1974</DATE> to <DATE>1978</DATE>, and
again from <DATE>1982 to 1986</DATE>, when he was defeated by <ORGANIZATION>Republican Ada</ORGANIZATION>.

   Gov. <PERSON>Joseph Ada</PERSON>'s chief counsel contends in
court papers that the <DATE>1973</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> decision guaranteeing
the right to an abortion does not apply to this <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> territory.
   The memorandum argued that <PERSON>Roe vs. Wade</PERSON> and <PERSON>Webster</PERSON> v.
<ORGANIZATION>Reproductive Health Services</ORGANIZATION>, the <DATE>July</DATE> decision giving states more
authority to restrict abortion without overturning the earier
ruling, are not in force in <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> because it is a territory.
   Ada signed the nation's most restrictive anti-abortion measure
into law last month. Enforcement remains on hold pending a hearing
in federal court <DATE>May 8</DATE> on a challenge brought by a woman who wants
an abortion.
   <PERSON>Katherine Maraman</PERSON>, the governor's legal counsel, and attorney
<PERSON>Monessa Lujan</PERSON> argued that many of the Constitution's due process
and equal-protection provisions do not fully apply to <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> in
recognition of its traditions.
   The new law, if upheld by the court, would make it a felony for
doctors to perform abortions and a misdemeanor for women to have
abortions, except in cases where the pregnancy would endanger the
mother's life.
   The measure also makes it a misdemeanor to solicit women to have
an abortion.

   The <ORGANIZATION>Securities and Exchange Commission</ORGANIZATION> voted to authorize its staff to charge <ORGANIZATION>Matthews &amp; Wright Group Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and several officers of that bond house with fraud and other securities law violations, according to people familiar with the situation. 

   The action occurred <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> at a closed meeting and wasn't announced. 
It authorizes the <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION>'s enforcement staff to enter into settlement negotiations and, if those fail, to file suit alleging a host of violations in connection with <ORGANIZATION>Matthews &amp; Wright</ORGANIZATION>'s role as underwriter of more than <MONEY>$1 billion</MONEY> of municipal bonds and as issuer of its own stock, the individuals said. 

   The vote, though unannounced, appears to kick off a kind of fall offensive by the <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION> against abuses in the municipal-bond market. 
The agency is scheduled to release today the results of its investigation into <ORGANIZATION>Washington Public Power Supply System</ORGANIZATION>'s gigantic 1983 <MONEY>$2.25 billion</MONEY> municipal-bond default. 
It also plans today to decide in an open meeting whether to release a broader report on the municipal-bond market in general, perhaps to demonstrate that the <ORGANIZATION>WPPSS</ORGANIZATION> case isn't an anomaly, as some on Wall Street contend. 
Finally, it will vote on whether to propose for comment a rule designed to enhance disclosure in the municipal market. 

   By taking action against <ORGANIZATION>Matthews &amp; Wright</ORGANIZATION> and proposing changes in the way the municipal-bond market works, the <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION> may hope to assuage some in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> who expressed outrage when it was reported this year that the commission had rejected its staff's recommendation to bring charges in the <ORGANIZATION>WPPSS</ORGANIZATION> matter. 

   <PERSON>Gary Lynch</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION>'s enforcement chief, couldn't be reached for comment. 
An agency spokeswoman declined to comment. 

   <PERSON>David Aufhauser</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Matthews &amp; Wright</ORGANIZATION> attorney, said, "I've had discussions with the commission staff, but I can't comment beyond that." 
<ORGANIZATION>Matthews &amp; Wright</ORGANIZATION> has consistently denied any wrongdoing, and insists that all its municipal-bond underwritings conformed with industry practices. 

   The <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION>'s charges pertain to about 25 municipal-bond deals underwritten by <ORGANIZATION>Matthews &amp; Wright</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1985</DATE> and <DATE>1986</DATE>, and to an offering of 1.5 million shares of its stock in <DATE>August 1986</DATE>. 
The <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION> case doesn't include <ORGANIZATION>Matthews &amp; Wright</ORGANIZATION>'s best-known deals, the <MONEY>$380 million</MONEY> of controversial issues underwritten for <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Northern Mariana Islands</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1984</DATE> and <DATE>1985</DATE>. 

   The agency may have chosen not to include the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> issues in part because they are being scrutinized by other arms of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> government. 

   Last year, a federal grand jury in <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> charged <PERSON>Arthur Abba Goldberg</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Matthews &amp; Wright</ORGANIZATION>'s executive vice president, with fraud, bribery and obstruction of justice. 
<PERSON>Mr. Goldberg</PERSON>, who is on a voluntary leave of absence from the firm, pleaded innocent, and is scheduled to go on trial in <DATE>January</DATE>. 

   Last month, the <ORGANIZATION>Internal Revenue Service</ORGANIZATION> said interest income on the <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Marianas</LOCATION> bonds isn't exempt from taxes. 
The tax-exempt status is the major selling point of municipal bonds. 
New York-based <ORGANIZATION>Matthews &amp; Wright</ORGANIZATION> responded that it believes the issues were made validly and that the interest income is tax exempt. 

   In addition to <PERSON>Mr. Goldberg</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>Matthews &amp; Wright</ORGANIZATION> officials who could be charged by the <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION> are Chairman <PERSON>George Benoit</PERSON> and <PERSON>Roger Burns</PERSON>, treasurer and chief financial officer. 
Also listed is <PERSON>Bernard Althoff</PERSON>, who is identified as the firm's outside corporate counsel.

<HEAD>Guam Wants US Reparations for Japanese Damage in WWII</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Guam wants the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> to pay <MONEY>millions of
dollars</MONEY> in reparations for the brutal Japanese occupation of the
<LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> island during World War II, a debt the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> government
forgave in <DATE>1951</DATE> for diplomatic reasons.
   ``Although we feel that a moral obligation'' falls on <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, ``we
cannot seek justice from the Japanese,'' said <PERSON>Joseph F. Ada</PERSON>,
governor of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> territory located only 1,150 miles from <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>.
   From 1941-44, <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> suffered through some of the most brutal
treatment ever inflicted on an American community. Survivors recall
massacres, beatings, forced labor and other horrors.
   But the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> ``most unfortunately gave away our right to
reparation from the Japanese in its <DATE>1951</DATE> peace treaty with <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> ...
without anybody once asking our people,'' according to <ORGANIZATION>Ada</ORGANIZATION>.
   The <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration opposes reparations, saying the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
government spent <MONEY>$8 million</MONEY> immediately after the war on 4,200
death, personal injury and property damage claims.
   ``There is no reason for the American taxpayers to pay further
compensation for World War II claims arising from enemy action,''
said <PERSON>Larry L. Morgan</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Interior Department</ORGANIZATION>, which in <DATE>1950</DATE> took
over responsibility for <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> from the <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION>.
   A <ORGANIZATION>Guam Reparations Commission</ORGANIZATION> appointed this year asked for
compensation totaling <MONEY>$160 million</MONEY> to include payments for deaths,
injuries, forced labor, forced marches or internment.
   The waiver of Japanese reparations, granted early in the Korean
War, ``was a policy decision of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> to conclude a
quick treaty with <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> ... to turn <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> into a valuable Asian ally
and a bulwark against communist expansion,'' <ORGANIZATION>Ada</ORGANIZATION> said.
   Ada appeared last month at a hearing on <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> war reparations
legislation introduced by <PERSON>Ben Blaz</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION>'s non-voting delegate in
the <ORGANIZATION>House of Representatives</ORGANIZATION>. The measure faces more hearings and a
possible committee vote later this year.
   The island of 212 square miles _ about one-sixth the size of
<LOCATION>Rhode Island</LOCATION> _ was acquired from <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> in <DATE>1898</DATE> after the
Spanish-American War. It remains a key <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Pacific military base.
   Japanese still invade <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION>, but this time as tourists boosting
the island's main civilian industry, accounting for most of the
500,000 annual visitors to <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION>'s beaches.
   Blaz and <ORGANIZATION>Ada</ORGANIZATION> say the new payments are justified in light of <MONEY>$67
million</MONEY> paid in Micronesian war claims and the <MONEY>$20,000</MONEY> authorized by
<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> for each Japanese-American interned during World War II.
   Too little time was allowed for filing claims after the war and
there was confusion over the eligibility of <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> natives, who
received <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> citizenship only in <DATE>1950</DATE>, said Blaz.
   Guam senator <PERSON>Eddie Duenas</PERSON> said: ``Apparently, many who were
eligible failed to file mostly because they did not know about it or
were too preoccupied rebuilding their shattered lives.''
   A Guamanian woman, <PERSON>Mrs. Beatrice Perez Emsley</PERSON>, recalled during
the <DATE>summer</DATE> hearings that as a girl of 13 she regained consciousness
in a mass grave of decapitated and mutilated Chamorros, native
tribespeople.
   She said a Japanese soldier had tossed her there without
realizing that his attempt to behead her had failed because he used
a bayonet instead of sword.
   ``I could not breathe from the pain in my neck and head and the
dirt was beginning to choke me ... I had to bear the pain and keep
still or else those Japanese soldiers would stab me or shoot me,''
she said.
   <PERSON>Mrs. Emsley</PERSON>, now 58, said she finally crawled into the jungle and
wandered for a week until another Guamanian fugitive found her.
Years later, they met members of the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. 3rd Marine Division</ORGANIZATION> who
were liberating the island.
   Reparations ``will not remove from us the awful memories of the
horrors we witnessed or experienced,'' she said, but they ``will
show us just that somebody cares about what happened to us.''
   Duenas, the senator, said that the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> made death
payments ranging as low as <MONEY>$221</MONEY> and high as <MONEY>$3,500</MONEY> to 750 people on
<LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> after the war.

A major earthquake rocked the <LOCATION>Northern Mariana Islands</LOCATION> <TIME>this morning</TIME>, and 
seismologists pinpointed its epicenter off <LOCATION>Anatahan Island</LOCATION>, about 230 miles 
north of <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION>. The island was evacuated two days earlier amid mounting fears 
that its volcano was erupting. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Paul Hattori</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Geological Survey</ORGANIZATION> office in <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> said the temblor had 
a magnitude of 7.4 and placed its epicenter in the <LOCATION>Marianas Trench</LOCATION>, one of the 
world's deepest ocean chasms, in the <LOCATION>Western Pacific</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Gov. <PERSON>Larry Guerrero</PERSON> of the Commonwealth of the <ORGANIZATION>Northern Mariana Islands</ORGANIZATION> issued 
a tidal wave warning for <LOCATION>Saipan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Tinian</LOCATION> islands, part of the island cluster 
that comprise the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> territory. 
</P>
<P>
The <TIME>7:14 a.m.</TIME> jolt startled residents from their sleep on <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> and several 
other islands in the <LOCATION>Mariana</LOCATION> chain, but there were no immediate reports of 
damage or injuries.

<HEAD>SEC Said to Authorizes Civil Charges Against New York Bond House</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The <ORGANIZATION>Securities and Exchange Commission</ORGANIZATION> has
authorized its staff to charge <ORGANIZATION>Matthews &amp; Wright Group Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and
several officers of the bond house with fraud and other abuses in
connection with the underwriting of more than <MONEY>$1 billion</MONEY> in
municipal bonds, the Wall Street Journal reported <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   Quoting what it called people familiar with the situation, the
newspaper said the <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION> took the unannounced step at a closed-door
meeting <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>. The reported action followed a major inquiry into
the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> firm's activities.
   <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON>Mary McCue</PERSON> declined comment on the Journal
report, in accordance with the agency's policy on enforcement
matters.
   But the <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION> had stated in a previously published notice that its
agenda for the <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> session included ``institution of
administrative proceedings of an enforcement nature.''
   <PERSON>David Aufhauser</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Matthews &amp; Wright</ORGANIZATION> attorney, was not
immediately available to comment, a receptionist said. The Journal
quoted him as saying he'd had discussions with the <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION> staff but
could not elaborate.
   <ORGANIZATION>Matthews &amp; Wright</ORGANIZATION> has consistently denied wrongdoing and has
asserted its underwriting practices conform with industry practices.
   The Journal quoted sources as saying the <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION> action means the
agency's enforcement staff will enter into settlement negotiations
with <ORGANIZATION>Matthews &amp; Wright</ORGANIZATION>. If those fail, the sources were quoted as
saying, the <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION> may charge the firm with a range of alleged abuses.
   Most of the charges stem from <ORGANIZATION>Matthews &amp; Wright</ORGANIZATION>'s role as an
underwriter of 25 municipal bond deals in <DATE>1985</DATE> and <DATE>1986</DATE>, the
sources were quoted as saying.
   The <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION> case doesn't include the firm's best-known deals, <MONEY>$380
million</MONEY> in questionable issues underwritten for <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> and the
<ORGANIZATION>Northern Mariana</ORGANIZATION> islands in <DATE>1984</DATE> and <DATE>1985</DATE>, the newspaper quoted
sources as saying.
   It was unclear why these were omitted, but the newspaper said it
may have been because other government enforcement agencies are
scrutinizing them.
   Last year a federal grand jury in <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> charged <PERSON>Arthur Abba
Goldberg</PERSON>, the firm's executive vice president, with fraud, bribery
and obstruction of justice. He's pleaded innocent and will go on
trial in <DATE>January</DATE>.
   In <DATE>August</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>Internal Revenue Service</ORGANIZATION> decreed that interest
income on the <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Mariana</ORGANIZATION> bonds aren't tax-exempt. This is
significant because the tax-exempt status of such issues is a major
selling point of municipal bonds.
