<TEXT>
THE Sultan of <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION> does not like being called the world's richest
individual. But with a fortune estimated at Dollars 37bn (Pounds 20.7bn), it
is hard to deny being among the wonderfully wealthy.
His <PERSON>Majesty Paduka Seri Baginda Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah Mu'izzaddin
Waddaulah</PERSON>, <PERSON>Sultan</PERSON> and <PERSON>Yang Di-Pertuan</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Brunei Darussalam</LOCATION>, is celebrating
25 years as absolute monarch of this small but financially well endowed
state on the west coast of the island of <LOCATION>Borneo</LOCATION>.
Yesterday was the main event to mark the anniversary of the sultan's
'ascension' to the throne. The sultan also serves as prime minister and
defence minister. Government is very much a family affair. One brother is
minister of foreign affairs, another is finance minister.
Lavish is one word to describe the Sultan of <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION>'s palace. Large is
another. A banqueting hall where 6,000 sat down to an anniversary meal
yesterday. A palace with 257 lavatories and a total of nearly 1,800 rooms.
Several sultans, princes and princesses, Asian heads of state and other
dignitaries watched the sultan ascend his throne. Tiaras were de rigueur.
Diamonds dazzled.
There have been no elections in <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION> for more than 30 years. A state of
emergency has been in force ever since British troops were brought in to put
down an uprising in <DATE>1962</DATE>. <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION> only became fully independent in <DATE>1984</DATE>.
The sultan, still only in his mid-40s, made a royal anniversary statement.
The present system of monarchical government had served <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION> well. There
would be no change. That means no elections and no political parties. Islam
would continue to be emphasised. The sultan would donate Dollars 1m of his
own money to help the Moslems in <LOCATION>Bosnia</LOCATION>.
One of the sultan's many Rolls Royces purred outside. The monarch was taken
a short distance and then off-loaded onto the royal chariot, a rather
unwieldly vehicle the length of a cricket pitch pulled and pushed by a small
army of courtiers.
The sultan is an ex-Sandhurst man. The guards slow-stepped in perfect
formation. The band played Malay music. It played '<ORGANIZATION>Colonel Bogey</ORGANIZATION>'.
Cash from oil and gas has transformed <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION>. With a population of only
250,000 the country has one of the highest per capita incomes in the world.

Darussalam</LOCATION>, and his delegation arrived in <LOCATION>Tehran</LOCATION> <TIME>this evening</TIME>. 
Our correspondent reports: [passage omitted] 
  Upon his arrival to <LOCATION>Tehran</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Bolkiah</PERSON> said that the 
expansion of relations in all fields was the most important aim 
of his visit to our country. 
  <PERSON>Mr. Hashemi-Rafsanjani</PERSON> spoke on the visit of the sultan of 
<LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION>, saying: 
  [Begin <PERSON>Rafsanjani</PERSON> recording] <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION> is an Islamic country, 
its people are committed Muslims, and its government and people 
are all Muslims and our brothers. 
  In our foreign policy we give priority to Islamic countries. 
I had asked the esteemed sultan of <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION> to visit <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> to 
discuss common religious issues and the current situation in the 
world of Islam, which necessitates cooperation among Islamic 
countries. Also his excellency can become more familiar with 
<LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> and we can get to know <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION> better. We can also assess 
any kind of cooperation which may exist between us and <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION>. 
In any case, we believe that further cooperation among Islamic 
countries is in the interests of Muslims and their countries. 
We hope to pave the way for further cooperation and become 
closer to each other. [end recording]

SULTAN <PERSON>Hassanal Bolkiah</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION> collects luxury hotels like the rest of us
collect postage stamps.
But when you have a personal fortune of Dollars 37bn you can afford to be a
bit choosy about where you put your head down for the night.
The Sultan of <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION> (left) this week agreed to pay Dollars 202m for the
luxurious <ORGANIZATION>New York Palace Hotel</ORGANIZATION> on Madison Avenue. The <PERSON>Sultan</PERSON> and his family
also own the top of the range <ORGANIZATION>Beverly Hills Hotel</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> and the
<LOCATION>Dorchester</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>.
Closer to home, the Sultan controls two Hyatt hotels in <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION>. When the
<PERSON>Sultan</PERSON> held a sit-down dinner party last year at his palace in <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION> for
nearly 6,000 people as part of celebrations of his 25 years on the throne,
Hyatt chefs and waiters were flown in from <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>.
If the Sultan tires of hotel living on his frequent trips abroad there are
alternatives available. The Sultan's family are believed to have at least
two houses in <LOCATION>Beverly Hills</LOCATION>.
There are various houses and flats dotted round <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>. Then there is the
main British residence - a country house conveniently situated close to
<LOCATION>Heathrow</LOCATION> airport. The <PERSON>Sultan</PERSON> also has a mansion in central <LOCATION>Kuala Lumpur</LOCATION>.
The Sultan's latest acquisition has an interesting history. The <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>
Palace Hotel was once called the <ORGANIZATION>Helmsley Palace</ORGANIZATION>, after <PERSON>Mrs Leona Helmsley</PERSON>,
once the most famous hotelier in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> and a leading <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> socialite.
But the <PERSON>Helmsley</PERSON> hotel empire came crashing down in <DATE>1989</DATE> when <PERSON>Mrs Helmsley</PERSON>,
known as the 'Queen of Mean' for her treatment of hotel employees, was
sentenced to imprisonment for tax evasion and mail fraud.
As the Sultan of <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION>'s investment advisers were putting the final touches
to documents buying the old <ORGANIZATION>Helmsley Palace</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Mrs Helmsley</PERSON> herself was moving
into less salubrious hotel accommodation - a halfway-house low-cost hotel
just down the road from her old stamping ground.

FT  17 OCT 92 / Despatches: Dinner for 5,750 please, James - Brunei / Kieran
Cooke sups with a sultan but finds the six-hour wait tedious
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
WHEN THE richest man in the world issues a dinner invitation, it is best to
be punctual. The sultan of <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION>, estimated to be worth a cool Dollars 37bn
(Pounds 20.7bn) at the last count, was throwing a little anniversary bash
marking his 25 years on the throne.
Dinner was at 7.30. At 5.30, a few select members of the international media
arrived at the palace gates. The sultan is known to be a bit of a stickler
when it comes to dress. Slept-in suits were brushed down. Scuffed shoes were
given a quick wipe. Stained ties were adjusted. The man from Russian TV
looked in need of a snort of vodka.
It was going to be a cosy affair. Just us, the sultan, a sprinkling of Malay
royalty, a layer of heads of state, a few prime ministers added as garnish.
Plus a few thousand other dignitaries, even a few ordinary people. A mere
5,750 altogether, all seated in the same room.
You either hide your wealth or flaunt it. Sultan <PERSON>Hassanal Bolkiah</PERSON>, 29th
sultan and absolute ruler of <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION>, is not afraid of spending a bob or two.
His palace is described as the biggest in the world. There are nearly 2,000
rooms. There is a throne room that can seat 2,000. Marble covers more than
12 acres of wall. Carpets as lush as newly-fallen snow. Chandeliers that
weigh a ton apiece. Gold that hurts the eyes. Nearly 300 lavatories.
The meal was running late. No one can raise a fork until the sultan gives
the word. We waited. The dining room was a cross between <LOCATION>Versailles</LOCATION> and high
season at Butlins.
'G'day,' said an Australian waiter, one of more than 700 catering staff
flown in for the occasion. 'Not a bad little party, eh?'
In the kitchens, chefs sweltered and tempers frayed. Plates of prawns
collided with sides of mutton. The meat for the meal was flown in from
<LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> where the sultan's ranch is twice the size of <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION> itself.
More waiting. A few of the down top table guests sloped in. Prince <PERSON>Edward</PERSON> -
representing his mother, <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s Queen <PERSON>Elizabeth</PERSON> - sat in the corner by
the royal serving hatch. A Thai prince smiled serenely at the ceiling. A
Malay princess adjusted a troublesome tiara.
The sultan, still only in his mid-40s, has two wives and 10 children. And a
great deal else besides. Two palaces in <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION> plus a hotel in <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION> and
another which he bought, then sold, to the <ORGANIZATION>Brunei Investment Agency</ORGANIZATION> (BIA), a
secretive organisation that handles an estimated Dollars 35bn of the
country's international investments.
The sultan has a mansion in <LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION>. He owns the <LOCATION>Beverly Hills</LOCATION> hotel in the
<LOCATION>US</LOCATION>, plus another couple of houses in <LOCATION>Tinseltown</LOCATION>.
His father was something of an anglophile who even had a special <ORGANIZATION>Winston
Churchill</ORGANIZATION> museum built in <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION>. That has been closed but the present
sultan - who spent time at <LOCATION>Sandhurst</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>'s military college for
officers - still maintains strong British links.
He bought the <LOCATION>Dorchester</LOCATION> hotel in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> but sold it recently to the <ORGANIZATION>BIA</ORGANIZATION>.
There are various flats and houses dotted round the British capital. The
sultan's main residence is a country house situated on the flight path to
<LOCATION>Heathrow</LOCATION> airport.
The sultan is partial to planes. He bought his own 747 recently and has a
couple of other jets in <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION>. Then there are the automobiles: estimates of
the number of his Rolls-Royces vary between 135 and 157. Plus a whole
starting grid of sports cars.
Dinner was getting very late. There were ugly mutterings from the
international press. No alcohol allowed in this increasingly Islamic state.
Diplomats, dressed in their full regalia, perspired quietly; their wives
glowed.
The sultan loves polo. He flies in whole teams to play special tournaments.
His horses are said to have air-conditioned stables.
<LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> has a battalion of Gurkhas stationed in <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION>. The sultan has his
own Gurkha battalion, made up of retired soldiers who now form the palace
guard. Any mutinous sounds from the waiting diners and the kukris might be
out.
Army chaps were the only ones to maintain stiff upper lips throughout the
long wait. They would not even taste a tumbler of water until the sultan -
always referred-to among expatriates as 'HRH' - had first lifted a glass.
It was 9.45 pm when the sultan finally arrived. The whole family was in
attendance. The sultan doubles up as prime minister and minister of defence.
A brother is foreign minister, another is minister of finance.
Sultan, princes, princesses and prime ministers sat down, stock still. Not a
word was spoken. Just the sound of a thousand camera shutters clicking.
The press were ordered back to table. The sultan had given the word. Food
was fallen on. The Russian fantasised about the cold of a <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> winter.
'And then you drink - like that,' he said, knocking back a pineapple juice.
We rose. 'Tut, tut,' said the army. Dammit all, everyone has to wait till
<ORGANIZATION>HRH</ORGANIZATION> has finished. We escaped through the kitchens.
'You people have no bloody decorum,' said the Australian waiter, smiling. We
agreed. Six hours of dinner was enough, even if it was with the richest man
in the world.

expansion of cooperation between us. Hashemi-Rafsanjani added: 
We are aware of your satisfactory stances vis-a-vis the problem 
of <LOCATION>Bosnia-Herzegovina</LOCATION> at the <ORGANIZATION>Islamic Conference Organization</ORGANIZATION> 
[ICO]. We hope to be able to increase the <ORGANIZATION>ICO</ORGANIZATION> activities. 
  Our country's president pointed out the existence of the 
<ORGANIZATION>Association of South East Asian Nations</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Economic 
Cooperation Organization</ORGANIZATION> in the two mainly Muslim regions, and 
described cooperation between <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION> as an effective 
factor that can contribute toward further cooperation between 
the two regions. 
  Hashemi-Rafsanjani also stressed the need for the two 
countries' cooperation in the oil and gas industries and 
announced <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION>'s readiness to help <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION> with its technical and 
scientific needs in those industries. The president also 
welcomed the two countries' cooperation in cultural and artistic 
fields. 
  Then the Sultan of <PERSON>Brunei Hassanal Bolkiah</PERSON>, thanked our 
country's president for his kind remarks and praised the certain 
and valuable status of the Islamic Republic of <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> at global 
levels and said: <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION> has always supported <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION>'s principled 
and progressive stance in international circles and believes 
itself in such stances. 
  He added: We cooperate very well within the <ORGANIZATION>ICO</ORGANIZATION> and the 
Non-Aligned Movement. We have always condemned the aggression 
against the Bosnian Muslims and are ready to help them. We are 
ready to cooperate in the oil and gas industries and hope to be 
able to witness the expansion of relations between the two 
countries in all fields, particularly cultural fields.

<HL> Sultan of Brunei to Pay $200 Million
For Beverly Hills Hotel, Sources Say

<TEXT>
   The Sultan of <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION>, one of the world's wealthiest men, has agreed to buy the legendary <LOCATION>Beverly Hills</LOCATION> Hotel from oil tycoon <PERSON>Marvin Davis</PERSON> for more than <MONEY>$200 million</MONEY>, hotel sources said. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Davis</PERSON> purchased the <ORGANIZATION>Beverly Hills Hotel</ORGANIZATION>, also known as the <ORGANIZATION>Pink Palace</ORGANIZATION> for its distinctive coloring and its star-studded clientele, from the family of <PERSON>Ivan F. Boesky</PERSON> and others for about <MONEY>$135 million</MONEY> last <DATE>December</DATE>. 
The sale followed <PERSON>Mr. Boesky</PERSON>'s <MONEY>$100 million</MONEY> settlement of insider-trading charges brought by the <ORGANIZATION>Securities and Exchange Commission</ORGANIZATION>. 

   The hotel sources said <PERSON>Mr. Davis</PERSON> and the Sultan of <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION> have agreed on a price, and the transaction is expected to close sometime next week. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Davis</PERSON> couldn't be reached, and spokesmen for him declined to comment. 

   The purchase of the posh hotel was the jewel in <PERSON>Mr. Davis</PERSON>'s growing block of <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> real estate and restored some of the glamour the investor gave up by selling <ORGANIZATION>Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp.</ORGANIZATION> to <ORGANIZATION>Rupert Murdoch</ORGANIZATION>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Davis</PERSON> also said, after he bought the hotel, that the purchase had personal meaning, because he spent his honeymoon in the hotel and once lived in one of its bungalows. 

   Since the purchase of the hotel, <PERSON>Mr. Davis</PERSON> has frequently presided over breakfasts in the hotel's <ORGANIZATION>Polo Lounge</ORGANIZATION>, a popular breakfast locale for the entertainment industry. 

   Hotel sources also said they understood the sultan was reportedly a losing bidder in the <DATE>December</DATE> sale of the hotel but persisted in trying to buy the hotel from <PERSON>Mr. Davis</PERSON>. 
"The guy finally came back with a price that was so far and away unbelievable that (<PERSON>Mr. Davis</PERSON>) just had to say OK," said one hotel source, adding, "<PERSON>Marvin</PERSON> has a deep personal attachment to the place." 

   Another factor in <PERSON>Mr. Davis</PERSON>'s decision to sell the 75-year-old hotel was his discovery that renovation costs would be higher than originally estimated, according to the source. 
<PERSON>Michael Ullman</PERSON>, the hotel's general manager, has said the hotel was planning "substantial renovations" and even the addition of a nightclub. 
Many of the hotel's competitors, including the <LOCATION>Beverly Wilshire Hotel</LOCATION>, are being renovated. 

   A price-tag for the hotel of more than <MONEY>$200 million</MONEY> wouldn't make a very big dent in the net worth of the sultan. 
In its current issue, Fortune magazine pronounced him the world's richest man, estimating his personal net worth at <MONEY>$25 billion</MONEY> or more. 
The sultan, who rules <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION>, a tiny country on the oil-rich island of <LOCATION>Borneo</LOCATION>, lives in a 1,788-room palace and owns more than 200 polo ponies, according to the story. 

   The sultan couldn't be reached for comment. 

   The hotel wouldn't be the sultan's first. 
He snapped up <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>'s elegant <LOCATION>Dorchester</LOCATION> Hotel 2 1/2 years ago for a price that wasn't disclosed from <ORGANIZATION>Regent International Hotels</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION>. 
A hotel spokeswoman at the time said the price paid was "certainly in excess" of the <MONEY>$52 million</MONEY> that <ORGANIZATION>Regent</ORGANIZATION> had paid for the <LOCATION>Hyde Park</LOCATION> property less than a year earlier. 

   The sultan entered the national spotlight earlier this year when the congressional investigation into the Iran-Contra affair revealed that he had contributed <MONEY>$10 million</MONEY> to the Contra rebels at the request of the <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> administration. 
That contribution was eventually returned to the Sultan after it was deposited in the wrong Swiss bank account.

Al-Fayed</PERSON> to help them buy it.
   The ruler of <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION> acknowledged that a power of attorney
privilege was granted to <PERSON>Mohamed Al-Fayed</PERSON> to buy the <LOCATION>Dorchester</LOCATION>
Hotel for the sultan.
   If this privilege was used for something else, it was done so
totally without the sultan's authority or knowledge, the statement
said.
   On <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, the government released a report by <ORGANIZATION>Department of
Trade and Industry</ORGANIZATION> inspectors saying the Al-Fayeds lied about their
wealth and background to succeed with the bid and that it was
likely they used their association with the sultan to enable them
to obtain funds toward the takeover.
   They said they believed the Al-Fayeds did not have enough money
of their own to buy the retailing group.
   ``The evidence pointing to <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION> is very strong indeed,'' the
report said, ``and we have conveyed our findings to the sultan. Our
views stand.''
   The Al-Fayeds deny they misled anyone and maintain that they
paid for <ORGANIZATION>House of Fraser</ORGANIZATION> with their own cash.
   Trade Secretary <PERSON>Nicholas Ridley</PERSON> said <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> he would not seek
disqualification of any of the company's directors.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Serious Fraud Office</ORGANIZATION> and the Director of the <ORGANIZATION>Public
Prosecutions</ORGANIZATION> announced last week they would not pursue a criminal
prosecution in connection with the takeover.

<TEXT>
   The <ORGANIZATION>Association of Southeast
Asian Nations</ORGANIZATION> is in town for it 22nd meeting and the streets are
bedecked with bunting, so why do the decorations feature the number
43 instead of 22?
   Because the bunting isn't for the delegates; it's for the sultan,
who turns 43 on <DATE>July 15</DATE>.
   The sultan, who has 37 words in his name and title, is worth <MONEY>$30
billion</MONEY> and takes very good care of the 241,000 people over whom he
has absolute sway.
   He is <PERSON>Duli Yang Maha Mulia Paduka Seri Baginda Sultan</PERSON> and <PERSON>Yang
Di-Pertuan Negeri Brunei Awang Muda Hassanal Bolkiah Mu'issaddin
Waddaulah Ibni Duli Yang Teramat Mulia Paduka Seri Begawan Sultan
Awang Muda Omar Ali Aifuddin Saifuddin Sa'adul Khairi Waddin</PERSON>.
   Most people just call him Sir <PERSON>Hassanal Bolkiah</PERSON>.
   His sultanate, 2,226 square miles on the north coast of <LOCATION>Borneo</LOCATION>,
sits on a huge pool of oil and natural gas.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Guinness Book of World Records</ORGANIZATION> says Sir Hassanal is the
world's richest individual becauwe oil income and foreign currency
reserves totaling almost <MONEY>$30 billion</MONEY> are ``effectively at his
disposal.''
   Fortune magazine confirmed his enormous wealth and said <PERSON>King Fahd</PERSON>
of <LOCATION>Saudi Arabia</LOCATION> was second with <MONEY>$18 billion</MONEY>.
   Secular, religious and military power rest with the sultan, a
hereditary ruler who is head of state, prime minister, defense
minister and commander of the armed forces.
   One of his brothers is in charge of foreign affairs and another
heads the <ORGANIZATION>Finance Ministry</ORGANIZATION> of this former British protectorate,
which became fully independent five years ago.
   As well as being the richest person in the world, Sir Hassanal
lives with his relatives in the world's biggest palace _ a complex
of buildings built with 38 types of marble on a 300-acre hill near
the <LOCATION>Brunei River</LOCATION>.
   In case friends decide to stay over, it has 1,778 rooms and 257
toilets. There are 564 chandeliers, 18 elevators, 44 staircases and
a banquet hall that seats 4,000.
   His majesty's polo ponies have air-conditioned quarters.
   More than 2,000 workers completed the Istana (palace) <PERSON>Nurul Imam</PERSON>
for independence in <DATE>1984</DATE> and the sultan never said how much it cost.
Guesses at the time started at <MONEY>$250 million</MONEY>, but suppliers who know
what went into it _ including 22-carat gold tiles on interior arches
_ say at least <MONEY>$600 million</MONEY>.
   The sultan has two wives. He was married first to Her Majesty the
<PERSON>Raja Isteri Pengiran Anak Saleha</PERSON> and then to Her Royal Highness
Pengiran Isteri Hajjah Mariam. He has three sons and six daughters.
Saleha, the sultan's first cousin, resides in the <LOCATION>Nurul Imam</LOCATION>.
   Mariam (born <ORGANIZATION>Mariam Bell</ORGANIZATION>) keeps house in a smaller and newer
palace, <LOCATION>Nurulizza</LOCATION>, 14 miles from the capital. Their marriage caused
a rift between the sultan and his father, <PERSON>Sir Omar</PERSON>, because she was
a commoner and part Japanese. <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> occupied <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION> during World War
II. The sultan met <PERSON>Mariam</PERSON> when she was a hostess on the <ORGANIZATION>Royal Brunei
Airlines</ORGANIZATION>.
   The royal family, in power for 29 generations, ensures continued
support for autocracy by providing subsidized food, fuel, housing
and free education and medical care. There is no personal income tax.
   Shortly after independence, <LOCATION>Sir Hassanal</LOCATION> was quoted as saying his
subjects enjoyed ``a good life. Why should they want more?''
   Bruneians seem content. The happiest probably are the civil
servants, who make up <PERCENT>46 percent</PERCENT> of the work force of 85,000. Along
with standard benefits, they get free pensions and interest-free
loans to buy cars and houses.
   Traffic jams are common in <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION>, which has one car for every
2.3 people.
   Prince <PERSON>Mohamed Bolkiah</PERSON>, the foreign minister, told reporters
covering the conference: ``The people seem to be very happy with the
way we are running things. The people accept it.''
   They certainly are spared worries that trouble the foreigners
here assembled. There is no national debt, no trade deficit, no
balance of payments problem and the budget always shows a surplus.
Oil and natural gas account for <PERCENT>99 percent</PERCENT> of exports.
   Sir <PERSON>Hassanal</PERSON> was attending <ORGANIZATION>Sandhurst Military College</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>
when his father abdicated in <DATE>1967</DATE> and he was summoned home at age 21
to take the throne.
   Sultan Omar continued to run things from behind the scenes for
another 15 years, however, and the polo-playing young potentate took
the opportunity to build an international reputation as a playboy.
   <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION>'s last flirtation with an elected parliament was in <DATE>1962</DATE>,
when it was still a British protectorate.
   The Parti Rakyat <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION>, since outlawed, won all 16 seats on the
<ORGANIZATION>Legislative Council</ORGANIZATION>. Sultan Omar refused to convene the council and
an uprising ensued.
   Britain crushed the rebellion and a state of emergency declared
at the time remains in force.

<TEXT>
   Burglars stole <MONEY>$6.5 million</MONEY> worth of jewelry and
cash from the <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> home of Prince <PERSON>Jefri Bolkiah</PERSON>, whose brother is
a sultan considered to be the world's richest man, police said
<DATE>Monday</DATE>.
   The intruders entered through a first-floor window of the red
brick house in the north <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> district of <ORGANIZATION>East Finchley</ORGANIZATION> late in
the afternoon <DATE>Thursday</DATE> or in the <TIME>evening</TIME>, said Detective
Superintendent <PERSON>David Staff</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Scotland</LOCATION> Yard.
   Police said details were being kept confidential at the sultan's
request.
   Prince <PERSON>Jefri</PERSON> is the youngest brother of the 42-year-old sultan of
<LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION>, who has 37 words in his name and title but is generally
called Sir <PERSON>Hassanal Bolkiah</PERSON>. The sultan is worth an estimated <MONEY>$30
billion</MONEY> and is listed in the <ORGANIZATION>Guinness Book of World Records</ORGANIZATION> as the
world's richest man.
   Staff, the detective superintendent, said the prince's wife,
<PERSON>Princess Norhayti</PERSON>, was not at home when the robbery occurred.
   ``No physical violence'' was involved, he said, and the thieves
had ``no contact'' with any of the household staff or security
guards. He would not elaborate. He also would not say whether the
house had been ransacked or if selected items were taken.
   <PERSON>Fred McColl</PERSON>, the family's lawyer, said additional security
measures had been taken but he would not give details. Asked whether
former employees were being questioned, he replied: ``We are
questioning a number of people.''
   Newspaper reports said the gang must have had intimate knowledge
of the complex security systems and alarms in the house.
   <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION>, on the northwest coast of <LOCATION>Borneo</LOCATION>, is rich in oil and
natural gas and the revenues go to the sultan, who also is prime
minister and defense minister. It is a former British protectorate
and became fully independent on <DATE>Dec. 31, 1983</DATE>.
   <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s record robbery was of an estimated <MONEY>$48 million</MONEY> from a
safe deposit center in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Knightsbridge</LOCATION> district in <DATE>1987</DATE>. The

   In regard to your Aug. 22 article calling the sultan of
Brunei the world's richest man: Here is a story that was told
to me by his relative, the sultan of Johor:
   Some months ago, the sultan of Brunei visited Barney's,
and selected a few suits and shirts. When he tried to pay
with his American Express traveler's checks, the cashier
requested a driver's license and two other forms of ID.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   When the sultan told her that he didn't have a driver's
license, she said, "Sorry, it's against store policy for me
to accept your check."
   At that moment, one of the sultan's quick-thinking
bodyguards presented the cashier with a <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION> dollar (Guess
whose portrait is on the money?) and inquired, "Will you
accept this as a photo ID?"

   Burglars broke into the <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> home of the brother

<TEXT>
   On a continent where kings were once
revered as gods, <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION>'s half-dozen surviving monarchies include a
diverse clutch of modernizing kings and a sultan who wields absolute
power.
   King <PERSON>Bhumibol Adulyadej</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION>, the world's longest reigning
monarch following the death <DATE>Jan. 7</DATE> of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Emperor Hirohito</PERSON>, has
initiated several thousand rural projects and spends much of each
year in the countryside personally helping peasants to design
irrigation canals, improve crops and combat disease.
   Aside from <LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, monarchs also reign in <LOCATION>Nepal</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Bhutan</LOCATION> in the <LOCATION>Himalayias</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION> on <LOCATION>Borneo</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION> in
<LOCATION>Southeast Asia</LOCATION>.
   Unlike his remote predecessors in <LOCATION>Nepal</LOCATION>, Harvard-educated <PERSON>King
Birendra</PERSON> criss-crosses his mountainous nation and has set a goal of
fulfilling the basic needs of an impoverished populace by the year
<DATE>2000</DATE>.
   In the kingdom of <LOCATION>Bhutan</LOCATION>, <PERSON>King Jigme Singye Wangchuk</PERSON> pores over
economic development plans and almost daily deals with petitions
submitted by subjects.
   Hirohito, whose funeral will be held <DATE>Feb. 24</DATE>, is widely credited
with having helped <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s postwar economic miracle by preserving
national unity and traditional virtues through his symbolic role.
But the late emperor, who renounced his divinity after <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s
defeat in World War II, spent most of his 62 years on the
Chrysanthemum Throne behind the walls of <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Imperial Palace</ORGANIZATION>.
   His son and successor, Emperor <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON>, 55, broke with tradition
by marrying a commoner and has travelled with his family by train,
thrown out the first ball at baseball games and mixed with his
fellow Japanese at numerous public functions.
   Though he is expected to breach some of the barriers between
emperor and subjects, <PERSON>Akihito</PERSON> is unlikely to interact as intimately
with his subjects and their daily problems as do the other Asian
royals _ nor wield anywhere near as much tangible power.
   The most powerful and richest of the continent's five remaining
hereditary monarchs is <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION>'s Sultan <PERSON>Hassanal Bolkiah</PERSON>, an absolute
ruler who resides in a 1,788-room palace and keeps some of his 200
horses in air-conditioned stables. Fortune magazine in the <LOCATION>United
States</LOCATION> <DATE>last year</DATE> named him the world's richest man, with assets
estimated at <MONEY>$25 billion</MONEY>.
   Besides being head of state, he is also prime minister and
defense minister and has included two of his brothers in the Cabinet
to help rule over the oil-rich nation about the size of <LOCATION>Maryland</LOCATION> on
the north coast of <LOCATION>Borneo</LOCATION> island.
   <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION>'s sultan harkens back to days when the pomp, pageantry and
proclamations of hundreds of bluebloods _ kings, princes, sultans,
maharajahs, newabs and nizams _ were as vital a part of <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> as its
rice fields.
   But by mid-century, royal ranks had been thinned by communist
revolutions, independence struggles and the spread of Western
democracy. Other crowns have toppled in more recent times.
   The last emperor of <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> abdicated in <DATE>1912</DATE>. Communists ended
imperial rule in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> at the end of World War II. <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s
independence from <LOCATION>Great Britain</LOCATION> in <DATE>1947</DATE> sounded the knell for
myriads of royals. <LOCATION>Cambodia</LOCATION>'s kingdom ended amidst war and chaos in
<DATE>1970</DATE>, though Prince <PERSON>Norodom Sihanouk</PERSON>, formerly the king, is still
active as an exiled guerrilla faction leader. The last king of
<LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Mohammad Zaher Shah</PERSON>, was toppled in <DATE>1973</DATE> and is exiled
in <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> but recently offered to help in a transitional government
in his country.
   Today, there remain but five Asian hereditary kingdoms and
<LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION>, where every five years one of the country's sultans is
elected a constitutional monarch.
   Nine of <LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION>'s 13 states have sultans who are constitutional
heads of the state governments. They have no political power. Every
five years these sultans meet to elect by secret ballot one of
themselves to be the national king. By tacit agreement each state
gets a turn at having its sultan king sooner or later. At the
national level the king is the constitutional head of state but
political power rests with prime minister.
   The present king of <LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION> is Sultan <PERSON>Mahmood Iskandar</PERSON> from
Jahore state. His term expires this year.
   Today's Asian monarchies have deep roots and their forseeable
futures appear secure.
   Akihito is 125th in a line of emperors said to stretch back 2,600
years in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>. Though historians regard the first 14 emperors as
figures of myth, the Japanese imperial line is still the world's
oldest hereditary monarchy, and current public opinion polls favor
its continuation.
   Bhumibol, probably the most respected man in <LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION>, is heir to
750 years of monarchy.
   Bolkiah is <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION>'s 29th ruler while <LOCATION>Nepal</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Bhutan</LOCATION> both have
centuries-old royal traditions.
   Although a constitutional monarch, the 61-year-old Thai king is
regarded as semi-divine by some and widely viewed as having held the
country together in wake of the coups and abortive power grabs that
have marked recent decades. He openly intervened to stop a serious
student-led uprising in <DATE>1973</DATE> and has in other moments of national
crisis played a decisive behind-the-scenes role.
   Named king in <DATE>1946</DATE> and crowned <DATE>four years later</DATE>, when he was a
jazz-loving teen-ager, <PERSON>Bhumibol</PERSON> was initially viewed as someone to
be used by military strongmen. Instead, he gradually reversed the
decline in prestige of the throne, largely by by-passing the elite
to work for the mass of have-nots in the countryside.
   <LOCATION>Nepal</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Birendra</LOCATION>, 43, likewise has sought links with the rural
poor, making frequent trips to remote areas to hand out relief
supplies and sound out the problems of villagers. But knowledgable
sources in <LOCATION>Nepal</LOCATION> and neighboring <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> say much of the effort is
negated by corruption within the royal family and its retainers _ an
open secret in <LOCATION>Katmandu</LOCATION>, the capital.
   Birendra has initiated some political reforms during his 16-year
rule but there are quiet critics of both the monarchy and limited
democratic rights. The king himself, seen as a reincarnation of the
Hindu god Vishnu, by law cannot be criticized.
   In <LOCATION>Bhutan</LOCATION>, the publicity-shy, 33-year-old <PERSON>King Jigme Singye
Wangchuk</PERSON> has continued his father's attempts at political evolution
and improvement in the lives of his 1.4 million, largely illiterate
people.
   ``Development is important but preserving our culture and our
values is equally important,'' <PERSON>Jigme Singye</PERSON> has said.
   <LOCATION>Bhutan</LOCATION> was only opened up from its medieval seclusion by his
reform-minded father.
   International aid agencies have been welcomed to <LOCATION>Bhutan</LOCATION> but mass
tourism has not. Tourism is seen as a destroyer of the old ways
upheld by the king, who always wears the traditional, robe-like
``kho'' _ even while playing basketball _ and is married to four
sisters of noble line, another time-honored custom.
   <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION>'s politics are said to be among the most sterile in <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION>
but the tiny state's 227,000 people have yet to show significant
signs of discontent. Under the 42-year-old sultan, the country
continues to prosper from its oil and natural gas reserves. Medical
care and education are free and the per capita annual income of
<MONEY>$21,000</MONEY> is among the highest in the world.
   The sultan, who has snapped up hotels, companies and other
investments around the world, moves freely among his subjects and is
credited with a number of civic improvements.

<TEXT>
   When <PERSON>Donald Trump</PERSON> bought the Plaza Hotel for roughly <MONEY>$400 million</MONEY> this year, the judgment of many real estate observers was that he paid too much. 

   Industry sources, however, say <PERSON>Mr. Trump</PERSON> already has received -- and rejected -- an offer for the Plaza that would have net him a <PERCENT>50%</PERCENT> profit. 

   The sultan of <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION>, reputedly the world's richest person, recently offered to buy it for a little more than <MONEY>$500 million</MONEY>. 
When <PERSON>Mr. Trump</PERSON> declined, the sultan upped his bid to roughly <MONEY>$600 million</MONEY>, the sources say. 
But <PERSON>Mr. Trump</PERSON> said no deal. 

   The sultan apparently didn't get wind that the Plaza had been on the market before <PERSON>Mr. Trump</PERSON>, who bought it from the <PERSON>Robert M. Bass Group</PERSON>, had more or less locked it up. 
"It was the one hotel he wanted to own more than any in the world," a source said of the sultan. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Trump</PERSON> declined to sell because he likes owning the famed, landmark hotel and wants to make good on his vow to make it the world's best, sources say. 
<PERSON>Mr. Trump</PERSON> declined to comment. 

   The ruler of <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION>, a tiny Asian nation on the oil-rich island of <LOCATION>Borneo</LOCATION>, has a fortune estimated at <MONEY>$25 billion</MONEY>, and lives in a 1,788-room palace. 

   Last year, the sultan bought the <LOCATION>Beverly Hills</LOCATION> Hotel from oil and entertainment tycoon <PERSON>Marvin Davis</PERSON>, reportedly for more than <MONEY>$200 million</MONEY> -- just months after <PERSON>Mr. Davis</PERSON> purchased it from one-time stock speculator <PERSON>Ivan Boesky</PERSON> for roughly <MONEY>$135 million</MONEY>.

<TEXT>
   A man ranked the wealthiest
in the world runs this tiny oil-rich Moslem kingdom, and diplomats
report little dissent from people unencumbered by income taxes,
medical payments or tuition fees.
   King <PERSON>Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah</PERSON> rules the enclave on the
northeastern tip of <LOCATION>Borneo</LOCATION> from his 1,788-room palace. Earlier this
month, Fortune magazine called him the richest man in the world,
worth <MONEY>$25 billion</MONEY>.
   Citizens of this southeast Asian nation do not appear to object
to the king's rule because he spreads some of the money around.
   ``They (the people) are well looked after, with free education,
medical treatment, cheap housing, good pensions and any one doing
well in his studies can easily get a university education abroad at
the government's expense,'' said one diplomat, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   He said there are no beggars, and about half the workforce is
employed by the government. The per capita income is estimated at
about <MONEY>$18,000</MONEY>, one of the highest in the world, according to
bankers and diplomats.
   All the money comes from oil and gas, which <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION> exports
mainly to <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>.
   A <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION> government official said recently that <DATE>1986</DATE> exports
amounted to <MONEY>$2.03 billion</MONEY> _ <PERCENT>99 percent</PERCENT> of it oil and gas. Imports
for the same year totaled <MONEY>$785 million</MONEY> in cars, foodstuffs and
other goods.
   The nation, about the size of <LOCATION>Delaware</LOCATION>, covers just 2,226 square
miles, much of which is not suitable for cultivation, an
agricultural officer said.
   Without daily newspapers, the nation's 227,000 people get their
news mainly through state-run radio, <LOCATION>Television Brunei</LOCATION> and some
government publications.
   An official in the <ORGANIZATION>Planning Unit</ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON>Malays</PERSON> form the majority
of <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION>'s population, but there are also about 60,000 Chinese and
other non-Malays.
   About 87,000 people are employed and of these 28,000 are foreign
workers, including foreign maids, doctors, lawyers, engineers,
accountants and others.
   <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION> has no elected <ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Sultan Bolkiah</PERSON> rules the
nation with the help of a Cabinet comprising two of his brothers
and about seven other people.
   The 41-year-old monarch, who studied in neighboring <LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION>
before a stint at the <ORGANIZATION>British Military Academy</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Sandhurst</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>England</LOCATION>, in <DATE>1966</DATE>, was crowned the 29th King of <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION> in <DATE>1967</DATE> by
his father Sir <PERSON>Omar Ali Saifuddin</PERSON>, who abdicated in favor of his
son.
   The king loves polo and has about 200 Argentine polo ponies,
some of which are kept in air-conditioned stables. He has two wives
and six children.
   In the 14th and <DATE>15th century</DATE>, <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION> was a large empire
stretching from the northern <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION> to most parts of <LOCATION>Borneo</LOCATION>,
but when the colonialists came <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION> shrank. <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION> became a
British protectorate in <DATE>1906</DATE> and won its independence on <DATE>Dec. 31,
1983</DATE>.
   The country has no income tax, gasoline is cheap and there are
no major taxes on cars, which are imported from <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> and
elsewhere. Diplomats estimate foreign reserves at <MONEY>$20 billion</MONEY>.
   The King has powers to detain and hold without trial anyone
deemed to be a threat to the security of the nation. On <DATE>July 14</DATE>,
the government released 34 such detainees, leaving just six still
in custody.
   Diplomats say there appears to be no long-term threat to
<LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION>'s economy as the 120,000 barrels of oil being pumped daily
is expected to last ``well into the next century''.
   <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION> is officially known as <LOCATION>Brunei Darusalam</LOCATION>.
   Darusalam means abode of peace ``and there is indeed peace
here'' said a diplomat, who added ``they could have added
prosperity to it.''

<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA_ ^Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MUSCAT, Oman (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration has welcomed the
global trend away from authoritarian rule, but at least two stops on
Secretary of State <PERSON>James A. Baker III</PERSON>'s swing through <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> seem immune to such democratic changes.
   <PERSON>Baker</PERSON> has spent much of the past four days in <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Oman</LOCATION>,
both sultanates that are virtually devoid of the democratic
trappings normally advocated by the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>.
   In this <LOCATION>Arabian Peninsula</LOCATION> nation, there are no political parties,
no legislature and no elections. All power rests with <PERSON>Sultan Qaboos</PERSON>,
the latest in a line of monarchs who have ruled this Kansas-sized
land since the <DATE>1740s</DATE>.
   Baker decided to stop off in <LOCATION>Oman</LOCATION> mainly to rest before joining
President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION>, the first stop on a four-nation European
tour.
   Oman was chosen in part because few Arab nations, if any, are
friendlier to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>. Oman was one of the first Arab
nations that endorsed the <DATE>1978</DATE> Camp <PERSON>David</PERSON> peace agreement between
<LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION>.
   As authoritarian rulers go, <PERSON>Qaboos</PERSON> appears to be more benign than
most. When he deposed his father in <DATE>1970</DATE>, <LOCATION>Oman</LOCATION> was a land plagued by
poverty, disease and illiteracy.
   In <DATE>19 years</DATE>, <PERSON>Qaboos</PERSON> has been able to forge what is for the most
part a modern, prosperous nation, overcoming such obstacles as a
forbidding climate that often sends temperatures above 130 degrees.
   According to <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION> figures, there were only three
schools in <LOCATION>Oman</LOCATION> in <DATE>1970</DATE>. In <DATE>1986</DATE>, there were 697. The number of
hospital beds rose from 12 to 2,800 in the same time period.
   Oil helped finance the boom, much as it did in <PERSON>Baker</PERSON>'s previous
stop, <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION>.
   Unlike <LOCATION>Oman</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION> has a constitution, but it provides <PERSON>Sultan
Hassanal Bolkiah</PERSON> with supreme executive authority.
   The occasion for <PERSON>Baker</PERSON>'s visit to <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION> was the annual meeting
of the six-member <ORGANIZATION>Association of Southeast Asian Nations</ORGANIZATION>.
   Like <LOCATION>Oman</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION> has a system with a social conscience,
providing subsidized food, fuel, housing, free education and medical
care.
   <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION>'s 250,000 citizens enjoy an unusually high standard of
living, which permits them to over look the opulent lifestyle of
their ruler and his two wives.
   The main attraction in <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION>, about the size of <LOCATION>Delaware</LOCATION>, is the
sultan's palace, a 1,788-room extravaganza with a dining room
capable of accommodating 6,000 for a sit-down meal. Need a bathroom?
The palace has more than 200.
   Amid such abundance, the sultan is somewhat wary about
inquisitive reporters. Before the start of the <ORGANIZATION>ASEAN</ORGANIZATION> conference,
reporters were told to write about the conference, not about <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION>.
   Still, the sultan has been unable to conceal his role as perhaps
the world's richest man, with an estimated wealth of <MONEY>$28 billion</MONEY>,
almost four times the gross national product of <LOCATION>Oman</LOCATION>.
   He is one of a handful of men who has claim to a fortune that
dwarfs the estimated <MONEY>$3 billion</MONEY> to <MONEY>$5 billion</MONEY> of <LOCATION>Zaire</LOCATION>'s autocratic
president, <PERSON>Mobutu Sese Seko</PERSON>, the last foreign leader whom <PERSON>Baker</PERSON>
entertained before departing on his tour.

   The Sultan of <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION>, one of the world's richest

   The <ORGANIZATION>Sunday Express</ORGANIZATION> said the sultan converted a ballroom at

   Congressmen interrogating <PERSON>Elliott Abrams</PERSON> have been criticizing evasions. 
It's time to ask them for a straight answer of their own. 
As <PERSON>Pete Seeger</PERSON> would put it: Which side are you on, boy? 
The Sandinistas or the anti-communists? 

   <PERSON>Mr. Abrams</PERSON> represents the success of the <ORGANIZATION>Contra</ORGANIZATION> policy, having helped keep the anti-communist cause alive while <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> was trying to kill it without taking responsibility for the results of doing so. 
As Secretary <PERSON>Shultz</PERSON> said in a statement <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, <PERSON>Mr. Abrams</PERSON> has done a "sensational" job. 
That is precisely why congressmen are calling for his resignation, and they ought to say so. 

   The congressmen of course claim they are upset because he lied to them, but in 10 hours of questioning they failed to make that case. 
So they resorted to pure badgering. 
<PERSON>Sen. Howell Heflin</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Ala.</LOCATION>) asked him if the <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION> had a school to teach evasive answers. 
Rep. <PERSON>Lee Hamilton</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Ind.</LOCATION>) said, "We cannot advance <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> interests if public officials who testify before the <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> resort to legalisms, word games, claim ignorance about things they either knew about or should know about and, at critical points, tell the <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> things that are not true." 
And from Rep. <PERSON>Jack Brooks</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>), "I can only conclude after this that you're either extremely incompetent or that you are still, as I say, deceiving us with semantics." 

   A bunch of politicians complaining about legalisms and semantics? 
Come on, congressmen. 
In those immortal words, where's the beef? 

   The case that <PERSON>Mr. Abrams</PERSON> misled <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> now rests on one incident, the soliciting of the sultan of <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION>. 
What happened was this: On <DATE>Nov. 25, 1986</DATE>, <PERSON>Mr. Abrams</PERSON> testified before the <ORGANIZATION>Senate Intelligence Committee</ORGANIZATION>, answering questions from <PERSON>Sen. Bill Bradley</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>) about funding for the Contras from abroad. 
His answers were literally correct, but he did not volunteer his solicitation of <MONEY>$10 million</MONEY> from the sultan of <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION>, which was obviously relevant to the senator's concerns. 

   Now, the solicitation was perfectly legal. 
Indeed, the <DATE>1986</DATE> Intelligence Authorization explicitly authorized the <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION> to solicit third countries for humanitarian aid. 
<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> refused to fund the Contras and instead wanted the <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION> to go, tin cup in hand, to solicit money for them from third countries. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Abrams</PERSON> had a dilemma; as he testified this week, he'd given the sultan's government a "flat, absolute promise of confidentiality." 
Unhappy with his answers to the committee, <PERSON>Mr. Abrams</PERSON> asked <PERSON>Mr. Shultz</PERSON> if he could call the leadership of the intelligence committee and tell them about <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION>. 
The secretary told him to break the confidentiality with the sultan if he thought he should. 
So he went back to the committee to voluntarily tell them about <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION> and apologize for having misled them. 

   A man who does this, the congressmen profess to believe, can't be trusted. 
Certainly he can't associate with the boy scouts who inhabit Capitol Hill hearing rooms. 
Off with his head. 

   What is the bottom line here, anyway? 
Demands that <PERSON>Mr. Abrams</PERSON> resign are best understood as subterfuge for some members' longstanding opposition to the Contras. 
Crocodile tears were shed when <PERSON>Mr. Abrams</PERSON> was told no more aid to Contras unless he resigned. 
So the congressmen, the same ones who ask for straight answers, are going to make <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> foreign policy out of pique with individual <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION> figures? 

   The issue is not <PERSON>Mr. Abrams</PERSON>, but the communists in <LOCATION>Managua</LOCATION>. 
What does the <ORGANIZATION>United States Congress</ORGANIZATION> propose to do about them? 
Does <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> stand with <PERSON>Elliott Abrams</PERSON> or with <PERSON>Dear Comandante Danny Ortega</PERSON>?

FT  03 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Brunei still sits cosily in its
Shell - A longstanding relationship that suits both parties
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EARLY THIS century two intrepid British geologists were cycling along a path
near the coast in <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION>, on the west of the island of <LOCATION>Borneo</LOCATION>. They paused
for a rest. Then one uttered the magic words: 'I smell oil'.
<LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION> has never looked back. The economy of the tiny sultanate is a
relatively simple affair. At present it produces 182,000 barrels of oil a
day. Exports of crude in <DATE>1990</DATE>, the last year for which official figures are
available, were worth <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION> Dollars 2.02bn (Dollars 1.27bn). Liquefied
natural gas exports were worth a similar amount.
Vast savings have accumulated over the years. The secretive <ORGANIZATION>Brunei
Investment Agency</ORGANIZATION> is believed to control a Dollars 35bn portfolio of
international investments, the income from which is now estimated to
contribute more to the government's coffers than revenues from oil and gas
combined.
<LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION>'s 270,000 people have one of the highest per capita incomes in the
world. Sultan <PERSON>Hassanal Bolkiah</PERSON>, now celebrating 25 years of absolute rule,
is generally regarded as the world's richest individual, with a personal
fortune estimated at Dollars 37bn.
The Sultan and the <ORGANIZATION>Royal Dutch/Shell</ORGANIZATION> group, in <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION> since <DATE>early this
century</DATE>, are the two main focuses of attention in <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION>. Shell has a
monopoly on <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION>'s oil and gas exports. There is very little other
industry in the country. The <ORGANIZATION>Shell</ORGANIZATION> group is by far the country's biggest
employer - apart from the government, which employs about 50 per cent of the
labour force.
Shell is reluctant to discuss amounts of revenue from its local operations.
But Singapore-based oil industry analysts estimate that <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION> contributes
about 10 per cent of the <ORGANIZATION>Shell</ORGANIZATION> group's overall world-wide profits.
The company now has seven offshore oil fields in <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION> and two onshore. It
 -and <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION> - have been fortunate that oil discoveries have tended to
coincide with the oil price rise shocks of the <DATE>last 20 years</DATE>.
Oil analysts say that exploration technology now being used in <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION> is
among the most advanced in the world: using three dimensional seismic
exploration techniques finds have been made under existing oil fields. In
recent years the <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION> government has been stressing the need to conserve
resources.
'This year <ORGANIZATION>Shell</ORGANIZATION> has successfully pressed the <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION> government for an
increase in oil production so as to recoup the recent investments it has
made in high technology exploration,' says an industry analyst. 'Next year
production will probably fall back to 150,000-160,000 b/d and at that rate
<LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION> has about 25 years' reserves of oil and about 40 years' reserves of
gas.'
Gas has been <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION>'s big success story. Twenty years ago, <ORGANIZATION>Shell</ORGANIZATION> built in
<LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION> what was then the world's biggest LNG processing plant. Gas is piped
from fields more than 30 km (18 miles) offshore and cooled at the plant
until it liquefies. It is then loaded on to <ORGANIZATION>LNG</ORGANIZATION> carriers and transported to
<LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>.
The <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION> plant has produced more than 90m tonnes of LNG over the past 20
years. Apart from domestic consumption, all LNG is purchased by three
Japanese companies: <ORGANIZATION>Tokyo Electric</ORGANIZATION> (the world's biggest private electricity
utility), <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> Gas and <LOCATION>Osaka</LOCATION> Gas.
LNG exports to <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> have been made under a 20-year contract that runs out
at the end of <DATE>March next year</DATE>. Another 20-year contract is being negotiated,
but there have been considerable problems. The seven LNG ships that
transport the gas to <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> are owned jointly by <ORGANIZATION>Shell</ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION>
government. At one stage the Japanese wanted a whole fleet of new tankers -
no small request with each ship costing around Dollars 300m.
The prices of <ORGANIZATION>LNG</ORGANIZATION> exports to <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> are determined by a complex formula based
on average prices of Japanese imported crude and referred to in the trade as
'The <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> Crude Cocktail'.
There continues to be arguments over price. Shell says talks are at a
crucial stage with no clear sign of when agreement can be reached. Industry
analysts say <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION> has the upper hand: the country has established itself
as a reliable, long-term supplier and about 14 per cent of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s total LNG
imports come from the sultanate. <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> wants to import more - if the
Japanese do not buy then <LOCATION>Korea</LOCATION> is a ready market.
All <ORGANIZATION>Shell</ORGANIZATION>'s operations in <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION> have a 50 per cent government shareholding.
<ORGANIZATION>Mitsubishi</ORGANIZATION>, the Japanese conglomerate, has 25 per cent stakes in <ORGANIZATION>LNG</ORGANIZATION>
processing and transport operations.
Most industry analysts see the Brunei/Shell relationship continuing. But
others are eager to enter. <LOCATION>Elf Aquitaine</LOCATION> has formed a partnership with a
local company believed to be controlled by <PERSON>Prince Jufri</PERSON>, the Sultan's
younger brother and minister of finance. Elf has found oil but it is
believed to be in fields that either stretch into Malaysian waters or into
adjacent Shell areas.
The present sultan and his advisers have pressed for a greater share of
profits from the <ORGANIZATION>Shell</ORGANIZATION> operations. Analysts feel the government has been
clever in its handling of the oil giant: it has not threatened to
nationalise but by taking a 50 per cent stake in all operations, it has been
able to exert a large degree of control.
For its part <ORGANIZATION>Shell</ORGANIZATION> is very careful to obey various government edicts.
Official requirements on employing large numbers of <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION> Malay people
rather than Chinese or others have led to serious staff shortage
difficulties. For all its economic clout, <ORGANIZATION>Shell</ORGANIZATION> makes sure it is not seen to
be interfering in any of <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION>'s internal affairs.
'No one outside really knows the exact terms of the contract between <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION>
and <ORGANIZATION>Shell</ORGANIZATION>,' says an industry analyst. 'But one thing is certain - it's very
good for <ORGANIZATION>Shell</ORGANIZATION> and good for <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION> as well.'

<TEXT>
A <ORGANIZATION>GROUP of Labour</ORGANIZATION> MPs <TIME>last night</TIME> accused the <ORGANIZATION>High Commission of Brunei</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>London</LOCATION> of failing to honour debts incurred by sponsored students from the
<LOCATION>Sultanate</LOCATION>.
In a motion tabled under parliamentary privilege, the MPs called on the
Sultan of <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION> to 'meet the debts owed by his <ORGANIZATION>High Commission</ORGANIZATION> to landlords
and other debts in the <LOCATION>United Kingdom</LOCATION>'.
The MPs, led by <PERSON>Mr Nigel Griffiths</PERSON> (<ORGANIZATION>Edinburgh South</ORGANIZATION>), said the commission
had failed to honour payments owed to the landlords of properties rented by
their students.
They added that promissory notes issued by the High Commissioner in the name
of the Sultan were 'worthless'. The <ORGANIZATION>High Commission</ORGANIZATION> failed to honour the
securities it had given to creditors.
The motion said that the High Commissioner had failed to answer
correspondance from solicitors and MPs and warned all universities of the
'financial unreliability' of the <ORGANIZATION>High Commission</ORGANIZATION>.

Scandal in Southeast Asia
Threatens Financier's Empire

<TEXT>
    Six months ago, <ORGANIZATION>Finance
Ministry</ORGANIZATION> officials of this oil-rich sultanate entered the
headquarters of <ORGANIZATION>National Bank of Brunei</ORGANIZATION> to seize all
documents related to the privately held bank's <MONEY>$687 million</MONEY>
loan portfolio.
   It didn't take long. 
The chief of the raiding party soon left with two dozen thin files tucked under one arm. 

   "There would be a signature card and nothing else," says a <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION> source familiar with the episode. 
"It was amazing: Here you had <MONEY>hundreds of millions of dollars</MONEY> in loans with no documentation whatsoever, no record of security, nothing." 

   What the officials did discover, however, was that about <PERCENT>90%</PERCENT> of the loans outstanding -- <MONEY>$621 million</MONEY> -- went to companies linked to or relatives of the wealthy Malaysian financier and hotelier Tan Sri Khoo <ORGANIZATION>Teck Puat</ORGANIZATION>, whose family owned more than <PERCENT>70%</PERCENT> of <ORGANIZATION>National Bank</ORGANIZATION>. 

   The <ORGANIZATION>National Bank</ORGANIZATION> affair has developed into one of the biggest financial scandals in <LOCATION>Southeast Asia</LOCATION> in recent years and threatens to embroil the Khoo family and the government of the tiny former British protectorate in protracted legal battles. 
Already, it has tarnished Tan Sri Khoo's name in financial circles, forcing him to resign from the board of <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Standard Chartered PLC</ORGANIZATION> and to sell the bulk of his <PERCENT>29%</PERCENT> stake in <ORGANIZATION>Exco International PLC</ORGANIZATION>, also of <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>. 

   Many bankers believe it also will force him to dismantle his vast business empire -- consisting of investments in hotels, property and financial services in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> -- to pay off more than <MONEY>$470 million</MONEY> owed by Khoo-related companies at the end of <DATE>1986</DATE>. 

   Neither <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION> officials nor spokesmen for Tan Sri Khoo will discuss details of the affair publicly. 
But an account of what happened can be pieced together from interviews with those familiar with the case and from an examination of documents obtained in <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION>. 

   <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION> sources close to the investigation of the bank, which the government seized and shut down on <DATE>Nov. 20</DATE>, say audits show that it functioned essentially as a powerful money machine for the 70-year-old financier and his family. 

   The inquiry's findings, corroborated in part by associates of the Khoo family, indicate that the big acquisitions that earned <PERSON>Tan Sri Khoo</PERSON> a reputation as a financial wizard with bottomless pockets were financed partly by what amounted to interest-free loans from <ORGANIZATION>National Bank</ORGANIZATION>. 
The acquisitions included stakes in both <ORGANIZATION>Exco</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Standard Chartered</ORGANIZATION>. 

   Among the <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION> government's other discoveries: 

   --<ORGANIZATION>National Bank</ORGANIZATION> pumped an ever-rising tide of funds into Khoo-family companies, with such loans jumping to <MONEY>$622 million</MONEY> by mid-1986 from <MONEY>$93 million</MONEY> at the end of <DATE>1980</DATE>. 
Almost all the loans were overdrafts, with no fixed schedule of repayment. 
Most went to shell companies that had minimal capitalization and pledged no security for the loans. 
Although the bank accrued interest on the loans and recorded it as profit, in many cases the Khoo companies failed to pay any interest for years at a time or paid only sporadically. 

   --The bank listed as active credits loans on which it hadn't received payments of interest or principal for years. 
In some cases, the borrowing concerns were defunct. 

   --The bank financed almost all of its Khoo-related lending with short-term, interbank borrowings from more than 30 non-Brunei banks, mainly in <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION>. 
It also used the borrowings to meet operating expenses, pay dividends and repay interest and principal on earlier borrowings. 
As the financial obligations of the Khoo family and <ORGANIZATION>National Bank</ORGANIZATION> grew, such borrowing escalated sharply, rising to <MONEY>$228 million</MONEY> at the end of <DATE>last October</DATE> from <MONEY>$129 million</MONEY> at the end of <DATE>1985</DATE> and just <MONEY>$32 million</MONEY> at the end of <DATE>1983</DATE>. 

   Documents obtained in the <ORGANIZATION>National Bank</ORGANIZATION> investigation also shed new light on one of the central mysteries of the affair: the close but enigmatic relationship between the Khoo family and <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION>'s ruling royal family, headed by 40-year-old <PERSON>Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah</PERSON>, who has served as both monarch and prime minister since <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION>'s independence in <DATE>1984</DATE>. 

   The documents indicate that the Khoo family made several offers in <DATE>1985</DATE> and <DATE>1986</DATE> to sell its entire interest in the bank to the sultan and to manage the bank on his behalf. 

   Sources believe that had the plan succeeded, it could have opened the way for <PERSON>Tan Sri Khoo</PERSON> to exercise enormous financial clout with little risk. 

   "My God, can you imagine? 
Khoo could have made a move on <ORGANIZATION>General Motors</ORGANIZATION> on the basis of <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION>'s wealth," says a financial analyst in <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION>. 
"He could have collateralized himself into becoming the richest man in the world." 

   <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION> has arrested five <ORGANIZATION>National Bank</ORGANIZATION> officials and auditors, including the chairman, <PERSON>Datuk Khoo Ban Hock</PERSON> -- who is <PERSON>Tan Sri Khoo</PERSON>'s eldest son -- and charged them with criminal breach of trust, criminal conspiracy to cheat companies or persons who might lend to or deposit funds with <ORGANIZATION>National Bank</ORGANIZATION>, and making false statements in annual reports of the bank. 

   Warrants have been issued for the arrest of two other Khoo associates and former <ORGANIZATION>National Bank</ORGANIZATION> officers in <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION>, but they haven't been located, and their whereabouts are unknown. 

   The bank officers and auditors have yet to enter a plea in the criminal proceedings. 

   <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION> also has filed civil suits against Khoo-related companies in <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION> for the recovery of about <MONEY>$442 million</MONEY> they borrowed from <ORGANIZATION>National Bank</ORGANIZATION> and against 14 Singapore-based, Khoo-controlled concerns that guaranteed the loans. 
A separate, <MONEY>$185 million</MONEY> suit has been filed in <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION> against <PERSON>Tan Sri Khoo</PERSON> himself as personal guarantor of Brunei-incorporated <ORGANIZATION>Leo Investment Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>National Bank</ORGANIZATION>'s biggest borrower. 

   So far, the Khoo family hasn't presented detailed defenses against any of the <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION> actions. 
Tan <PERSON>Sri Khoo</PERSON> is believed to be in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> and wasn't available for comment. 
The <PERSON>Khoo</PERSON> family's <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION> lawyers, <ORGANIZATION>Donaldson &amp; Burkinshaw</ORGANIZATION>, declined to discuss the matter. 

   In private, family associates don't seriously dispute some of the main findings of the investigation. 
But they contend that <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION>'s scanty banking regulations didn't expressly forbid such practices and argue that prior to the government's intervention, the bank had always met its financial obligations. 

   Noting that <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION> law doesn't bar a bank from lending to its officers or shareholders, a Khoo family associate says no provision was made for long-outstanding loans because the family "owned the bank and they owned the companies it lent to, and they know they can be repaid." 

   The associate adds: "It's like managing your own household account." 

   He and other acquaintances of the family allege that the Khoos and <ORGANIZATION>National Bank</ORGANIZATION> are victims of a "vendetta" waged by the <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION> government after the <PERSON>Khoos</PERSON>' once-close links to the royal family weakened in recent years for various business and political reasons. 

   These family associates bitterly criticize the arrest of <PERSON>Tan Sri Khoo</PERSON>'s son and refer to <PERSON>Datuk Khoo</PERSON> and the others held with him as "hostages." (The men arrested in the <ORGANIZATION>National Bank</ORGANIZATION> affair weren't charged under banking laws but rather with commercial crimes under <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION>'s penal code.) 

   More than 30 foreign banks, with loans outstanding to <ORGANIZATION>National Bank</ORGANIZATION> totaling as much as <MONEY>$234 million</MONEY> when it was seized, are watching the tussle anxiously. 
<LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION> is eager to persuade them that its crackdown isn't motivated by a campaign against the Khoos. 

   "Foreign banks got very antsy," says a <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION> source. 
"But in the long run it can only be a healthy thing to get a better grip on the banking system." 

   <ORGANIZATION>National Bank</ORGANIZATION> was formed in <DATE>1965</DATE> in <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION> -- then a British protectorate -- by <PERSON>Tan Sri Khoo</PERSON>. 
For years, the bank remained a sleepy institution in a colonial enclave. 
<LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION> was known mainly for its rich oil reserves, which today give its 220,000 residents a per-capita income of about <MONEY>$17,000</MONEY> a year, and for its polo-playing, Anglophilic Islamic monarchy, headed until <DATE>1967</DATE> by Sultan <PERSON>Hassanal Bolkiah</PERSON>'s father, Sir <PERSON>Omar Ali Saifuddin</PERSON>. 
Tan <PERSON>Sri Khoo</PERSON> forged a friendship with Sir Omar that led to business ties between the two families. 

   <ORGANIZATION>National Bank</ORGANIZATION> grew rapidly in the late <DATE>1970s</DATE> and early <DATE>1980s</DATE>. 
By then, though, <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION> was preparing for full independence and a new, nationalistic generation was revamping policies inherited from colonial administrators. 

   A skirmish in <DATE>1983</DATE> between <ORGANIZATION>National Bank</ORGANIZATION> and the government's newly overhauled <ORGANIZATION>Brunei Investment Agency</ORGANIZATION> -- custodian of an estimated <MONEY>$20 billion</MONEY> to <MONEY>$30 billion</MONEY> in petrodollar investments for the sultanate -- provided a whiff of trouble to come. 

   The agency's newly installed managing director, worried by talk of runs on <ORGANIZATION>National Bank</ORGANIZATION>, sought and received approval from Sultan <PERSON>Hassanal Bolkiah</PERSON> to withdraw deposits of <MONEY>$140 million</MONEY> in <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> currency and <MONEY>$47 million</MONEY> in <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION> money. 
Caught off guard, <ORGANIZATION>National Bank</ORGANIZATION> couldn't meet the demand for the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> dollars and asked for a year to repay the funds. 
It eventually managed to do so in about five months. 

   In <DATE>July 1986</DATE>, a new computerized monitoring system at the <ORGANIZATION>Finance Ministry</ORGANIZATION> picked up another warning signal almost by accident. 
Officials were attempting to analyze capital flows out of <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION> to ensure that banks were lending locally in proportion to their local deposit base. 
Because <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION>'s domestic economy is small and the country is wealthy, officials expected to find the banks to be heavy capital exporters. 
But one wasn't. 

   "While all the other banks were putting money offshore to the tune of <MONEY>several billion dollars</MONEY>, <ORGANIZATION>National Bank</ORGANIZATION> was bringing it in," recalls one financial source. 

   Because the bank paid high interest rates for its short-term foreign borrowing, it had to be making ever-riskier loans at even higher rates to earn a profit, ministry officials concluded. 
They decided an audit would be in order. 

   Within weeks, another bombshell fell that prodded them to take immediate action: <LOCATION>Switzerland</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Banque Gutzwiller</PERSON>, <PERSON>Kurz</PERSON>, Bungener announced plans for a <MONEY>$30 million</MONEY> issue of floating-rate notes for <ORGANIZATION>National Bank</ORGANIZATION>. 

   "It came totally out of the blue," says a source. 
On <DATE>July 29</DATE>, ministry examiners made the two-minute trip to <ORGANIZATION>National Bank</ORGANIZATION>'s two-story headquarters and asked for its loan register. 

   They were in for a shock. 
The register totaled just <MONEY>$46 million</MONEY>, while <ORGANIZATION>National Bank</ORGANIZATION>'s most recent monthly statements had shown loans outstanding of <MONEY>$687 million</MONEY>. 
Where was the balance? 

   On <DATE>July 31</DATE>, examiners confronted <ORGANIZATION>National Bank</ORGANIZATION>'s Brunei-based general manager, <PERSON>Azlan Robert Teo</PERSON>, with the discrepancy. 
<PERSON>Mr. Teo</PERSON> said he had provided figures for "local branches;" the remainder of the loans originated in the bank's "head office." 

   When examiners asked where the "head office" was, <PERSON>Mr. Teo</PERSON> pointed to the ceiling and said, "Upstairs," referring to the bank's upper story. 
But investigators later learned that "head-office" loans meant those booked at the <ORGANIZATION>Daiwa Building</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION>, the headquarters of <PERSON>Tan Sri Khoo</PERSON>'s Asian operations. 

   Annoyed and increasingly suspicious of <ORGANIZATION>National Bank</ORGANIZATION>'s evasions, ministry officials demanded that <PERSON>Mr. Teo</PERSON> turn over all loan documents. 

   The scanty records told them little about what <ORGANIZATION>National Bank</ORGANIZATION>'s loans ultimately had gone for, but they told a lot about how the bank operated. 
"It was as if it was actually two banks -- one for local lending in <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION> and another for lending to the Khoos," says one source. 

   Investigators found that at the end of <DATE>June 1986</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>National Bank</ORGANIZATION> had loans outstanding of <MONEY>$621 million</MONEY> -- about <PERCENT>90%</PERCENT> of its total portfolio -- to a few companies linked to <PERSON>Tan Sri Khoo</PERSON> or to his relatives. 

   <ORGANIZATION>National Bank</ORGANIZATION> records showed that loans outstanding to Khoo-related concerns more than tripled in <DATE>1981</DATE> to <MONEY>$327 million</MONEY>, leveled off briefly and then spurted again to <MONEY>$467 million</MONEY> in <DATE>1985</DATE> and <MONEY>$621 million</MONEY> by mid-1986. 
The portion of the bank's portfolio lent to Khoo-related companies or individuals ballooned to <PERCENT>80%</PERCENT> in <DATE>1981</DATE> from less than <PERCENT>50%</PERCENT> the year before, then rose to <PERCENT>90%</PERCENT> in <DATE>1986</DATE>. 

   While evidence of a direct correlation is skimpy and coincidental, the jumps in lending to Khoo-related companies closely parallel <PERSON>Tan Sri Khoo</PERSON>'s acquisitions of substantial shareholdings in <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific Hotel Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Exco</ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION>Standard Chartered</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1981</DATE>, <DATE>1985</DATE> and <DATE>1986</DATE>, respectively. 
Less than a month before the <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION> investigation began, <PERSON>Tan Sri Khoo</PERSON> completed the purchase of a <PERCENT>5.25%</PERCENT> stake in Standard Chartered for about <MONEY>$118.2 million</MONEY>. 

   Ninety percent of the Khoo-related loans was recorded as overdraft transactions in 24 accounts, with no repayment schedule specified. 
The loans had little or no documentation and, according to a source familiar with the records, "absolutely no collateral in any case." 

   <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION>'s seizure of <ORGANIZATION>National Bank</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Nov. 20</DATE> stunned the Khoo family. 
An acquaintance says they "honestly felt they were still in the negotiating stage." 

   Family associates privately spread the word among <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION> creditors that the <PERSON>Khoos</PERSON> were victims of a "vendetta" by <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION>'s government and the sultan. 
But <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION> sources say the vendetta charges don't stand up to close scrutiny. 

   The real center of the bank's activity was at the Khoo family's <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION> offices. 
Every <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>National Bank</ORGANIZATION> chairman, <PERSON>Datuk Khoo</PERSON>, would take a morning flight on <ORGANIZATION>Singapore Airlines</ORGANIZATION> to <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION> with slips of paper listing the previous week's transactions. 
Once there, he would bring the bank's books up to date. 

   In the <TIME>evening</TIME>, often after spending an hour or so at Sultan <PERSON>Hassanal Bolkiah</PERSON>'s <MONEY>$300 million</MONEY> palace -- a residential and government-office complex -- <PERSON>Datuk Khoo</PERSON> would catch the <ORGANIZATION>6 p.m. Royal Brunei Airlines</ORGANIZATION> flight to <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION>. 

   "The Khoos were just moving money around from one account to another while the total just kept growing," says a <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION> source close to the investigation. 
"They were using the bank as a way to borrow for themselves.

   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. -- The Beverly Hills Hotel is
planning a major renovation that's likely to result in the
temporary closing of the famous complex, which is known as
the "Pink Palace" from its outside color scheme.
   But Kerman Beriker, general manager and chief executive
officer, disputed a report in yesterday's Los Angeles
Business Journal that quoted industry insiders as saying the
hotel planned to close for two years, starting next
September. The article said the renovation would cost $150
million, not including lost revenue. "It's very premature,"
Mr. Beriker said. "Nobody really knows when we can start."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   <PERSON>Mr. Beriker</PERSON>, however, said that the almost 80-year-old
hotel is in dire need of a makeover. "To be a five-star
hotel, you need to have a five-star facility . . . and we
don't have it." He said that the hotel filed papers with the
<ORGANIZATION>City of Beverly Hills</ORGANIZATION> three weeks ago seeking various
building permits.
   The hotel is owned by the Sultan of <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION>, one of the
world's wealthiest individuals, who purchased it from oil and
film tycoon <PERSON>Marvin Davis</PERSON>. In <DATE>1986</DATE>, <PERSON>Mr. Davis</PERSON> bought the
hotel, a longtime oasis for the rich and famous, from <PERSON>Ivan F.
Boesky</PERSON>, the arbitrager who pleaded guilty to insider-trading
charges.

<TEXT>
   Leaders of <LOCATION>Southeast Asia</LOCATION> and
local royalty welcomed the 15-year-old future ruler of this tiny
oil-rich nation into the adult world <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> by sprinkling
scented water on his hands.
   Cannons fired in salute and thousands of Bruneians watched on TV
to watch the ritual for Prince <PERSON>Al-Muhtadee Billah</PERSON>, the son of
Sultan Hassanal Bolkia.
   Leaders from <LOCATION>Indonesia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION>, as well as 3,000 other VIPs, including members of the
royal family, government dignitaries and foreign diplomats, were
invited to the two-hour ceremony in the throne hall of the sultan's
1,778-room palace.
   The pomp and pageantry, a combination of Islamic ritual and
Malay culture, were actually a commemoration of Prince <PERSON>Billah</PERSON>'s
circumcision, a momentous event in the life of Malay Moslems.
   Even though the prince, eldest son of the 43-year-old sultan,
was circumcised a few years ago, the ceremonies were dubbed
``berkhatan'' _ Malay for circumcision.
   ``Coming of age is a more appropriate term,'' an official said,
but tradition dictates that such ceremonies be called berkhatan.
   A weeklong festival for the occasion began <DATE>Sunday</DATE> with the
beating of gongs and playing of pipes and other ethnic musical
instruments at the main gate to the 300-acre palace grounds.
   The streets of the capital were decorated with multicolored
lights and yellow Bruneian flags fluttering from the top of
virtually every building.
   Until <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, however, the ceremonies had consisted of solemn
prayers, chants of religious hymns and nightly poetry readings at
the palace.
   A few hours before <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>'s rites, the sultan, cited by the
<ORGANIZATION>Guinness Book of World Records</ORGANIZATION> as the world's wealthiest man, threw
an elaborate dinner at the cavernous royal banquet hall, whose
arches are covered with 22-carat gold tiles.
   His guest list was headed by President <PERSON>Suharto</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Indonesia</LOCATION>,
President <PERSON>Corazon Aquino</PERSON> of the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION> and Prime Ministers <PERSON>Lee
Kuan Yew</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Chatichai Choonhavan</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION> and
<PERSON>Mahathir Mohamad</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION>.
   In declaring the sultan the world's richest individual, <ORGANIZATION>Guinness</ORGANIZATION>
said that as its absolute ruler, he has <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION>'s oil income and
foreign exchange reserves of about <MONEY>$30 billion</MONEY> ``effectively at his
disposal.''
   After all guests were seated, about 100 men and boys marched up
the middle of the hall, bearing Prince <PERSON>Billah</PERSON>'s regalia. They
included spears, swords, shields, rifles, pennants, candles, drums,
brass vases and urns.
   Behind them walked the young prince, in a green costume gleaming
with gold embroidery. Light from 12 giant chandeliers _ each with
600 bulbs _ reflected off the gems on his headdress.
   The normally shy boy appeared nervous. Just before Moslem
priests began chanting praise to <LOCATION>Allah</LOCATION>, Prince <PERSON>Billah</PERSON> rose from his
cushioned throne-like chair, set under a gold-colored canopy.
Apparently realizing the miscue, he quickly sat back, his head
bowed slightly.
   As the chanting began, the boy's parents, the leaders and other
guests came forward one by one and sprinkled scented water on his
hands, resting on a cushion on his lap. Outside, cannons boomed.
   Prince <PERSON>Billah</PERSON> is the third of the sultan's six children by <PERSON>Queen
Saleha</PERSON>, his first wife, but the elder of two boys. The sultan has a
son and two daughters by his second wife, <PERSON>Queen Mariam</PERSON>.
   On <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, the prince will undergo a cleansing ceremony in the
privacy of his apartments. Officials say the equivalent of this
rite for commoners is a swim in a river.
   After that, 25,000 children and other residents are expected to
line the streets of <PERSON>Bandar Seri Begawan</PERSON> to cheer Prince <PERSON>Billah</PERSON> as
he rides past on a float.
   Ceremonies at the palace are to continue through <DATE>Sunday</DATE>.

   WASHINGTON -- Elliott Abrams, the State Department's top
officer for Central America in the mid-1980s, admitted in
federal court to withholding information from Congress
regarding secret White House efforts at the time to arm
anti-Sandinista guerrillas in Nicaragua.
   Mr. Abrams, a former assistant secretary of state, pleaded
guilty to two misdemeanor charges as part of an agreement
under which he must cooperate in a continuing investigation
of the Iran-Contra affair by Independent Counsel Lawrence
Walsh.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   <PERSON>Craig Gillen</PERSON>, <PERSON>Mr. Walsh</PERSON>'s associate counsel who
represented the prosecutor at the court proceedings, was
cautious in assessing <PERSON>Mr. Abrams</PERSON>'s value to the inquiry. But
as a senior <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> administration official, <PERSON>Mr. Abrams</PERSON> moved
in high circles and could shed light on the activities of
<ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Central Intelligence Agency</ORGANIZATION> officers in
connection with the same covert supply network.
   <PERSON>Duane Clarridge</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Central Intelligence Agency</ORGANIZATION> officer who
had been closely involved in the anti-Sandinista war, has
been identified as a target of <PERSON>Mr. Walsh</PERSON>'s inquiry. And the
prosecutor has given immunity to a former associate of <PERSON>Donald
Gregg</PERSON>, a national security adviser to then-Vice President
<PERSON>Bush</PERSON> and now <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION>.
   The charges against <PERSON>Mr. Abrams</PERSON>, which carry a maximum
penalty of one year in prison for each count, are themselves
the product of an earlier agreement in which <PERSON>Mr. Walsh</PERSON>'s
office won the cooperation of <PERSON>Alan Fiers</PERSON>, who headed the
<ORGANIZATION>CIA</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>Central America</LOCATION> task force in the mid-80s. <PERSON>Mr. Fiers</PERSON>
also pleaded guilty to withholding information from <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>,
and his testimony was instrumental in the case against <PERSON>Mr.
Abrams</PERSON> and in the more serious perjury charges brought last
month against the <ORGANIZATION>CIA</ORGANIZATION>'s former operations chief, <PERSON>Clair
George</PERSON>.
   With his hands clasped behind his back, the 43-year-old
<PERSON>Mr. Abrams</PERSON> answered simply "I plead guilty" after <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
district <PERSON>Judge Aubrey Robinson</PERSON> read each of the counts
against him. In a brief statement later, <PERSON>Mr. Abrams</PERSON> showed
flashes of his old defiance, but he was a far more subdued
figure than the brash assistant secretary who symbolized a
generation of young neo-conservatives in the <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>
administration. Many, like <PERSON>Mr. Abrams</PERSON>, had watched <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>
from academic campuses and had little patience with <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>
as they waged their proxy wars against communism from the
halls of <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>.
   A former <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> aide, <PERSON>Mr. Abrams</PERSON> infuriated Republicans
and Democrats alike in the <LOCATION>Capitol</LOCATION>, and yesterday's charges
focus on misleading testimony he gave in <DATE>October 1986</DATE> after a
cargo plane ferrying supplies to the Contras was shot down in
<LOCATION>Nicaragua</LOCATION>. Appearing before <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> committees, <PERSON>Mr.
Abrams</PERSON> sought to distance the <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> administration from the
supply network, and though he had directly solicited a <MONEY>$10
million</MONEY> contribution from the sultan of <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION> two months
earlier, he denied that foreign governments were helping the
Contras.
   At the time of his testimony, the administration was only
days away from overturning a ban on <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> funding for the war.
In a statement of facts accompanying yesterday's plea
agreement, <PERSON>Mr. Abrams</PERSON> is said to have feared that this
appropriations legislation would be lost if members learned
of the network.
   As assistant secretary, his specific knowledge grew out of
a close working relationship with <PERSON>Mr. Fiers</PERSON> and Marine Lt.
Col. <PERSON>Oliver North</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> aide who oversaw the supply
operation and served on a restricted interagency group headed
by <PERSON>Mr. Abrams</PERSON>.
   Beginning in <DATE>1985</DATE>, the court papers said, <PERSON>Mr. Abrams</PERSON>
became "generally aware" that Col. North was working with the
Contras, and he and <PERSON>Mr. Fiers</PERSON> had specifically discussed
using the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> aide's "private benefactor" network in
<DATE>July 1986</DATE> to get food to the insurgents when a government
"humanitarian" aid program ran out of funds.
   Using the pseudonym "Kennilworth," <PERSON>Mr. Abrams</PERSON> met with a
representative of the sultan of <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION> in a <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> park in
<DATE>August</DATE> that <DATE>summer</DATE>. The court papers show that before his
testimony in <DATE>October</DATE>, he was privy to subsequent <ORGANIZATION>State
Department</ORGANIZATION> cables showing that the sultan had agreed to give
<MONEY>$10 million</MONEY> and sent the money on to a Swiss bank account
that Col. North told <PERSON>Mr. Abrams</PERSON> about.
   Standing before television cameras later, <PERSON>Mr. Abrams</PERSON>
restated his guilty plea, but said the information withheld
had only to do with activities "which at that time I believed
to be proper and lawful." The former assistant secretary, the
first <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION> official to be charged by <PERSON>Mr. Walsh</PERSON>,
expressed pride in his government service, but said he was
"very happy to have this entire matter at long last behind
me."

<P>
Secretary of State <PERSON>James A. Baker III</PERSON>, determined to demonstrate American 
interest in <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION>, arrived <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> in this tiny but oil-rich nation where his 
predecessor, <PERSON>George P. Shultz</PERSON>, obtained an ill-fated <MONEY>$10-million</MONEY> contribution 
for the Nicaraguan Contras three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Baker came to this steamy capital for meetings that start today with the 
foreign ministers of the <ORGANIZATION>Assn. of Southeast Asian Nations</ORGANIZATION>, a 22-year-old 
organization that includes <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Indonesia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION>, 
<LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION>. He wants to discuss such issues as <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Cambodia</LOCATION> and 
a proposal for a new organization to foster economic cooperation among the 
nations of the <LOCATION>Pacific Rim</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
But the serious diplomatic objectives seem to be lost in this vest-pocket 
sultanate where the 215,000 citizens enjoy the world's highest per capita 
income -- about <MONEY>$15,000</MONEY> a year -- and where the ruler lives in a 1,700-room 
palace that looks a little bit like a luxury hotel might if the decorator was 
given an unlimited budget. 
</P>
<P>
It was in that palace that <PERSON>Shultz</PERSON>, the last secretary of state to stop here, 
obtained <PERSON>Sultan Muda Hassanal Bolkiah</PERSON>'s commitment for the <MONEY>$10-million</MONEY> donation 
to the Contras. However, the sultan was given the wrong Swiss bank account 
number, and the money never reached the insurgents fighting <LOCATION>Nicaragua</LOCATION>'s 
Sandinista government. It was discovered later to have been deposited to the 
account of a Swiss businessman who eventually returned it to the sultan. 
</P>
<P>
Baker assured reporters he would perform no similar errand this time. 
</P>
<P>
A senior <ORGANIZATION>Administration</ORGANIZATION> official who accompanied <PERSON>Baker</PERSON> on the flight from <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> 
to <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION> said the secretary of state reached agreement with Japanese Prime 
Minister <ORGANIZATION>Sosuke Uno</ORGANIZATION> that no new sanctions on <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> are warranted but that the 
existing ones should be kept in place until the <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION> government ends its 
crackdown on dissent. 
</P>
<P>
The officials said <PERSON>Baker</PERSON> and Uno stressed "the importance of not taking action 
that would isolate the Chinese people but at the same time taking action that 
would show our outrage" over the brutal suppression of the pro-democracy 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Baker</PERSON> will seek a similar agreement with the <ORGANIZATION>ASEAN</ORGANIZATION> foreign ministers. 
</P>
<P>
The senior official said <PERSON>Baker</PERSON> was unwilling to speculate about conditions that 
would prompt <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> to lift the sanctions that President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> imposed after 
the <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION> massacre of <DATE>June 3-4</DATE>. But he made it clear that no change in policy 
is likely any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
The President first suspended arms sales to <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and military contacts. Then 
he also suspended high-level diplomatic contacts and said he would work to 
persuade international lending bodies such as the <ORGANIZATION>World Bank</ORGANIZATION> not to grant new 
loans to <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Uno told <PERSON>Baker</PERSON> that <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> also has no plans to resume the economic programs 
that it interrupted after the crackdown, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
"They are taking a wait-and-see attitude," the official added. "That might not 
be too bad a formulation." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Avoiding Interference 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, it appears significant that diplomats are now talking about when 
the pressure on <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> might be eased. So far, they have concluded: not yet. In 
contrast, <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> is debating measures that would impose additional sanctions 
despite opposition from the <ORGANIZATION>Administration</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Although the <ORGANIZATION>ASEAN</ORGANIZATION> nations have generally expressed shock over recent events in 
<LOCATION>China</LOCATION>, they have avoided taking any sort of action that <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> might interpret 
as interference in Chinese internal affairs. 
</P>
<P>
"Normally the custom of <ORGANIZATION>ASEAN</ORGANIZATION> is not to comment on the internal affairs of 
other countries because we don't want others to interfere in our affairs," 
<PERSON>Tommy T. B. Koh</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION>'s ambassador to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, said recently. To 
which <LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION>'s ambassador, <PERSON>Albert S. Talalla</PERSON>, added, "Especially not <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>." 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>China</LOCATION> is expected to intrude into <PERSON>Baker</PERSON>'s discussion with the <ORGANIZATION>ASEAN</ORGANIZATION> ministers 
about proposals for a Pacific Rim organization to coordinate economic matters, 
much as the <ORGANIZATION>Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development</ORGANIZATION> has done for 
years in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Baker</PERSON> said in a speech last month that such an organization is "an idea whose 
time has come." But he carefully avoided spelling out details of how the plan 
should work, saying instead that the nations of the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> region should try 
to reach a consensus. 
</P>
<P>
The official traveling with <PERSON>Baker</PERSON> said that a key unanswered question is, "What 
do we do now with <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>?" 
</P>
<P>
He said it would be extremely difficult to include <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> in the organization 
after the events of last month in <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION>. He said that including <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> would 
have been troublesome even without the suppression of the pro-democracy 
movement because <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>'s economy is not a good match for the prosperous, 
capitalistic economies in the rest of the region. But some nations believe that 
the proposed organization should include every state in the area. 
</P>
<P>
ASEAN nations are known to be cool to the plan because they fear that it might 
dilute the influence of their existing organization. One <ORGANIZATION>ASEAN</ORGANIZATION> official said 
the annual meeting between the <ORGANIZATION>ASEAN</ORGANIZATION> foreign ministers and the foreign 
ministers of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and five other industrialized nations already 
provides enough economic coordination for the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> area.

<TEXT>
   When <PERSON>Adnan Khashoggi</PERSON> was still a boarding school
student in <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>, he introduced the fathers of two classmates. One,
an Egyptian, made towels and sheets; the other, a Libyan, was in
the market for those items.
   Khashoggi pocketed 200 pounds from the deal, along with the
discovery that ``it's only (by) putting people together (that) you
make money.''
   With that knowledge, he set out on an extraordinary
entrepreneurial life dedicated to the accumulation of spectacular
wealth and the cultivation of contacts everywhere in the world.
   He has been well rewarded, but in recent years he has been
dogged by controversy, by financial problems and, on <DATE>Friday</DATE>, by his
indictment on racketeering charges along with <ORGANIZATION>Ferdinand</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Imelda
Marcos</PERSON>.
   Until recently, the <LOCATION>Saudi</LOCATION> businessman's life was marked only by
opulence. He hopped from continent to continent in his own DC-8. He
reportedly had luxury homes in 10 cities. His yacht was fitted with
gold fixtures. He spent <MONEY>$250,000</MONEY> a day and exhibited no rich-man's
angst.
   The balding, rotund <PERSON>Khashoggi</PERSON>, 53, is the son of a physician to
the <LOCATION>Saudi</LOCATION> royal family. He was educated in economics at <ORGANIZATION>California
State University</ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION>Chico</LOCATION>. He had intended to study petroleum
engineering at the <ORGANIZATION>Colorado School of Mines</ORGANIZATION>, but encountered a
blizzard and turned westward, to warmer climes.
   While in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, he arranged for the exporting of American
goods to <LOCATION>Saudi Arabia</LOCATION>. When he returned to his native country, he
continued to act as broker between the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Saudi Arabia</LOCATION>, using
his royal connections.
   Khashoggi's bread-and-butter was guns. He served as a major
conduit for military materiel bound for <LOCATION>Saudi Arabia</LOCATION>.
   His <ORGANIZATION>Triad Holding Corp.</ORGANIZATION> branched out _ into Kenyan real estate,
Asian hotels, Indonesian shipping, French fashions, Lebanese
furniture, cattle raising in <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION> and an import company in the
<LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION>.
   In the mid <DATE>1970s</DATE>, <PERSON>Khashoggi</PERSON> became embroiled in the scandal
surrounding bribes by <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> companies to foreign governments. It was
alleged that part of <PERSON>Khashoggi</PERSON>'s commissions were funneled to
foreign officials. In <DATE>1977</DATE> he flew to <LOCATION>Barbados</LOCATION> to avoid a
<ORGANIZATION>Securities and Exchange Commission</ORGANIZATION> subpoena.
   Two years later he voluntarily gave a deposition to the <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION>, and
he was never charged in connection with the bribery scandal.
   Khashoggi's name made headlines again in <DATE>1986</DATE> when it was
revealed that he had brokered the U.S.-Iran arms deal that was at
the heart of the Iran-Contra scandal. <PERSON>Khashoggi</PERSON> said he lost <MONEY>$10
million</MONEY> on the deal, but that he never expected to make a profit _
if the result was peace between <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Iraq</ORGANIZATION>, he said, he would
make money by helping to rebuild those two countries.
   Khashoggi's wealth, meanwhile, seemed to vanish. <ORGANIZATION>Triad America
Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, his American holding company, filed for protection under
bankruptcy statutes. Work stopped on a <MONEY>$400 million</MONEY> office-shopping
complex in <LOCATION>Salt Lake City</LOCATION>. A British company, <ORGANIZATION>Lonrho PLC</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>,
sued because <PERSON>Khashoggi</PERSON> defaulted on two <MONEY>$4 million</MONEY> loans;
authorities temporarily seized two <PERSON>Khashoggi</PERSON> jets and his two-story
duplex apartment on <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION>'s Fifth Avenue.
   Finally, <PERSON>Khashoggi</PERSON> defaulted on a loan to the Sultan of <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION>,
who claimed the collateral _ his yacht, the <LOCATION>Nabila</LOCATION>. The Sultan then
sold the boat for <MONEY>$30 million</MONEY> to a tycoon of a different sort, <LOCATION>New
York</LOCATION> developer <PERSON>Donald Trump</PERSON>.

<TEXT>
   In a money-is-no-object land rush,
big egos and bigger bucks are tearing down grand but aging estates
on the world's highest-priced real estate to make room for lavish
super-shrines.
   The wealthy so-called Golden Triangle area _ <LOCATION>Beverly Hills</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Bel-Air</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Brentwood</LOCATION> _ roars and rumbles and rings with the din of
bulldozers and power saws.
   Some residents consider the new megamansions architectural
obscenities. The enormous <MONEY>$12 million</MONEY> palace under construction for
television mogul <ORGANIZATION>Aaron Spelling</ORGANIZATION> is bigger than the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> and
has been dubbed ``The Hilton'' by disgusted neighbors.
   ``Our peaceful neighborhood has been shattered,'' said one, <ORGANIZATION>J.P.
Guerin</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``It's ostentatious and over-consumption,'' added another,
<PERSON>Audrey Irmas</PERSON>, who won a court injunction limiting construction
hours and the number of trucks permitted at the site. ``The
<PERSON>Spellings</PERSON> are very self-centered to come in and destroy a
neighborhood like this.''
   <PERSON>Mrs. Irmas</PERSON> called the mansion, which includes a bowling alley
and an entire floor of closets, ``the mental institution, because
you'd have to be crazy to build something like that.''
   ``That's nothing,'' said <PERSON>Elaine Young</PERSON> of the real estate firm
<PERSON>Alvarez</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Hyland and Young</ORGANIZATION>. ``The biggest monument is going to be by
the Sultan of <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION> behind the <ORGANIZATION>Beverly Hills Hotel</ORGANIZATION>. He's torn down
five houses for a palace.''
   One was the estate of actor <PERSON>James Coburn</PERSON>, she said, adding: ``He
(the sultan) paid full price, <MONEY>$5 million</MONEY>, and it's a teardown.''
   Sentiment or nostalgia hold no sway in high-stakes real estate.
Homes once owned by <PERSON>James Cagney</PERSON>, <PERSON>Bing Crosby</PERSON> and others have
crumbled beneath bulldozer treads. Crosby's estate was just part of
the property Spelling leveled for his project.
   ``Everything is emotional. They want it, they buy it,'' said <PERSON>Ms.
Young</PERSON>. ``Nobody does a square footage cost on properties here
anymore.''
   <LOCATION>Beverly Hills</LOCATION>, where property value within the 5.6-square-mile
city limits is estimated at more than <MONEY>$5 billion</MONEY>, issued permits
for 28 teardown projects in <DATE>1985</DATE>, 43 in <DATE>1986</DATE> and 51 <DATE>last year</DATE>, said
city spokesman <PERSON>Fred Cunningham</PERSON>. Fourteen have been granted so far
this year.
   The trend is to buy a ``bargain basement'' house for <MONEY>$1 million</MONEY>
or more, raze it and build a grand, gated kingdom.
   ``They are buying these charming homes and ripping them down and
building these things,'' said <PERSON>Mrs. Irmas</PERSON>.
   A new law allows a structure to occupy a maximum <PERCENT>55 percent</PERCENT> of
the property. ``Some of these were really out of scale in the
neighborhood and we put in an emergency ordinance to stop it,''
<PERSON>Cunningham</PERSON> said.
   Architect <PERSON>Cliff May</PERSON>, father of the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> ranch-style house,
is a critic of the huge projects.
   ``Good architecture is something that fits in the neighborhood,
but nowadays, many architects are building monuments to their
clients and the homes look like castles and mausoleums,'' <DATE>May</DATE> said.
   Talk show host and producer <PERSON>Merv Griffin</PERSON> has also plowed money
into real estate. A few years ago he spent <MONEY>$5 million</MONEY>, modest by
<LOCATION>Beverly Hills</LOCATION> standards, on a four-acre stone mansion and
completely refurbished it.
   Now he's carving out a homesite on 150 acres in the <LOCATION>Santa Monica
Mountains</LOCATION> near the <PERSON>Benedict Canyon</PERSON> homes of Ann-Margret and <ORGANIZATION>Cher</ORGANIZATION>.
Earth-moving equipment is readying a 16-acre plateau for a
Palladian villa.
   Author <PERSON>Sidney Sheldon</PERSON> bought a Sunset Boulevard teardown for his
future mansion, to be called Rose Hill.
   The megamansion brouhaha is not confined to the Golden Triangle.
On the exclusive <PERSON>Palos Verdes</PERSON> peninsula overlooking the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION>,
the 49-room Via <LOCATION>Visalia</LOCATION> estate owned by <PERSON>Dennis</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mary Ellen
Hardin</PERSON> has provoked interest in an ordinance to limit structure
size. The home has been dubbed the ``Visalia Sheraton'' by angry
neighbors.
   ``I enjoyed not looking at all this,'' said neighbor <PERSON>Beth
Pinkley</PERSON>, who complains the house, with turrets, pillars and an
ornate brick and stone wall is an eyesore. It lures unsavory
``looky-loos,'' she said. ``It puts us at risk.''
   Elsewhere in <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION>, refurbishing old mansions _ as
opposed to tearing them down _ remains in vogue, particularly those
with plenty of square footage to knock around in. Examples include
The Knoll, a 35,000-square-foot estate remodeled by <PERSON>Kenny Rogers</PERSON>
and sold for <MONEY>$22 million</MONEY> to oilman <PERSON>Marvin Davis</PERSON>, and the <PERSON>Kirkeby</PERSON>,
the old ``Beverly Hillbillies'' estate undergoing extensive
remodeling by TV producer <PERSON>Jerry Perenchio</PERSON>.
   ``He stole that place for <MONEY>$13.5 million</MONEY>. It was the best buy in
town and will be worth <MONEY>$25 million</MONEY> when he's finished,'' <PERSON>Ms. Young</PERSON>
said of the <PERSON>Kirkeby</PERSON>.
   In the shadow of the <PERSON>Kirkeby</PERSON> is the modest <MONEY>$2.5 million</MONEY> home
where President and <PERSON>Mrs. Reagan</PERSON> will likely spend their <ORGANIZATION>post-White
House</ORGANIZATION> years. The value of the properly alone is estimated at almost
<MONEY>$3 million</MONEY>.
   <PERSON>Ms. Young</PERSON> said investors from all over the country are showing
up ``with suitcases full of money.''
   ``They don't even haggle over price,'' she said. ``You've got a
lot of people who have made money and this is a place to dispose of
it. Homes are much more important here than they are in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>,
and here people are much more into show.
   ``This is a definite show town. Everybody is trying to outdo
their neighbor, from cars to houses to designers to everything.''

   Who cares where <PERSON>Julio Iglesias</PERSON> sleeps? 
To hoteliers <PERSON>Jacques Camus</PERSON> and <PERSON>Charles Ferraro</PERSON>, it is a weighty matter. 

   Their obsession with the nocturnal habits of the Spanish crooner is just one manifestation of the luxury-hotel wars here, wars in which sleeping celebrities are among the key signs of victory. 

   Many of the nation's cities have competitive hotel markets, but nowhere is the competition so consumed with glamour, glitz and gossip as in status-conscious <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>. 
Top hotels have changed hands here like hot potatoes in recent years, and a score of new ones have popped up, inspiring some cut-throat tactics. 

   "There's a special aura to these hotels," says <PERSON>Arthur Hailey</PERSON>, who wrote the novel "Hotel." 
"It's the aura of the entertainment industry and the old <ORGANIZATION>Hollywood</ORGANIZATION>. 
The magic still lingers." 

   Perhaps in search of such magic, <PERSON>Mr. Iglesias</PERSON> has proved peripatetic. 

   "<PERSON>Julio Iglesias</PERSON> always stays here," says <PERSON>Mr. Camus</PERSON>, the general manager of the tony <ORGANIZATION>Westwood Marquis Hotel</ORGANIZATION> and Gardens as he gestures toward a display of celebrity photographs in his office. 
"He left two weeks ago." 

   He did indeed. 
At the new Four Seasons Hotel a few hours later and a few miles away, <PERSON>Mr. Ferraro</PERSON>, the general manager, points toward a guest room. 
"<PERSON>Julio Iglesias</PERSON> is in there," he says, a smile creasing his face. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Iglesias</PERSON> presumably had enough choices. 
The number of first-class hotels has surged to 134 from 86 just <DATE>eight years ago</DATE>, and the flurry of feisty new contenders is forcing some of the more staid old hostelries to undertake multimillion-dollar renovations. 
Partly because of the newcomers, overall occupancy rates slid to <PERCENT>73%</PERCENT> from <PERCENT>79%</PERCENT> even before the stock-market plunge, helping to keep hoteliers on their toes. 

   Not only are they on their toes; they are also slugging it out. 
Battles are fought over such weighty matters as who sleeps where, which power-breakfast chef makes the best French toast and who has the most expensive art. 

   Some of the campaigns in these wars aren't directed by general managers but by high-powered marketing and public-relations people. 
And camouflage is an important weapon: coats of fresh paint that mask worn-out wood balustrades, and legendary hotel names that mask Motel 6-sized rooms. 
The Four Seasons hired not one but two public-relations firms, and many a hotel is spending <MONEY>$40 million</MONEY> and up on that Hollywood tradition: the facelift. 

   The <DATE>October</DATE> stock-market collapse made some luxury-hotel guests stay home, and some hotels said business was off <PERCENT>10%</PERCENT> to <PERCENT>15%</PERCENT> as a result. 
Guests at the opulent <ORGANIZATION>Hotel Bel-Air</ORGANIZATION> made "quite a few changes of plans rather suddenly," says resident manager <PERSON>George Goeggel</PERSON>. 
Some guests, he says, "had to jet out fast." 
But business at most of the hotels has returned to normal. 
"Them that have always will have," says <PERSON>Mr. Ferraro</PERSON> at the Four Seasons. 

   Recruits to the hotel wars in the past few years include some of the world's wealthiest individuals. 
Dallas heiress <PERSON>Caroline Hunt</PERSON> added the <LOCATION>Bel-Air</LOCATION> to her group of hotels after an intense bidding battle. 
In <DATE>September</DATE>, the man reputed to be the world's richest, the sultan of <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION>, apparently bought the <LOCATION>Beverly Hills</LOCATION> Hotel from oil and entertainment tycoon <PERSON>Marvin Davis</PERSON> -- just months after <PERSON>Mr. Davis</PERSON> purchased it from onetime stock speculator <PERSON>Ivan Boesky</PERSON>. 

   And just last month, entertainer <PERSON>Merv Griffin</PERSON>, best known for his 23-year stint as a talk-show host, agreed to buy the <ORGANIZATION>Beverly Hilton Hotel</ORGANIZATION>. 
A Japanese concern also bid for the hotel, and Japanese are expected to show continued long-term interest in the market. 
"They already own most of the major hotels in downtown <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, and they'll continue to pursue the purchase of the premier hotels in the city," says <PERSON>John Cushman III</PERSON>, the president and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION>Cushman Realty</ORGANIZATION>. 

   The hotels weren't always so hot hereabouts. 

   "Prior to 10 years ago, <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> wasn't known as a good hotel market," says <PERSON>Saul F. Leonard</PERSON>, a partner at <ORGANIZATION>Laventhol &amp; Horwath</ORGANIZATION>, the accounting and consulting firm. 
But with the city's growth as the <LOCATION>West Coast</LOCATION>'s financial hub and the gateway to the <LOCATION>Pacific Rim</LOCATION>, businessmen with expense accounts have clamored for first-class hotel rooms. 

   Guests, who typically shell out <MONEY>$175</MONEY> to <MONEY>$300</MONEY> a night for a single (the price can go up to <MONEY>$3,000</MONEY> for the ne plus ultra in sybaritic surroundings), are being pampered with larger rooms or suites, real marble bathrooms with television, phones with more than one line, plush robes, exotic flowers and complimentary wine. 
A decade ago they would have been lucky to get a book of matches. 

   "We're all trying to outdo one another," says <PERSON>Michael Ullman</PERSON>, the general manager of the <ORGANIZATION>Beverly Hills Hotel</ORGANIZATION>. 
Some are even opening nightclubs. 
Last <DATE>August</DATE> the <ORGANIZATION>Mondrian Hotel</ORGANIZATION> on the Sunset Strip opened <PERSON>Piet</PERSON>'s Place, a hot outdoor Friday-night spot that has attracted people like actor <PERSON>Timothy Hutton</PERSON>, musician <PERSON>Elvis Costello</PERSON> and tennis star <PERSON>Chris Evert</PERSON>. 
The club is moving to warmer quarters at the Bel Age Hotel for the winter. 

   Much of the activity has been spurred by the Four Seasons, which opened only <DATE>last April</DATE> after a painfully long gestation period. 
The hotel, a pleasant but not architecturally spectacular 16-story residential tower, has been an aggressive self-promoter. 
A cocktail party in a tent six months before the hotel even opened drew the likes of <LOCATION>Zsa Zsa Gabor</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Henry Mancini</PERSON>. 
The group feasted on fried rabbit and oysters with leeks, bacon and periwinkles. 

   Hoteliers, however, scoff at the suggestion that the new hotel is hurting them. 
"Some of our bathrooms are larger than their rooms," says <PERSON>Severyn Ashkenazy</PERSON>, the owner of eight luxury hotels, including <LOCATION>L'Ermitage</LOCATION>. 
"Someone who would stay at the Four Seasons isn't our type of guest. 
He is the guest of hotel chains." 
But at least one hotelier, the late <PERSON>Hernando Courtright</PERSON>, fought hard to keep the new contender out. 

   Toronto-based <ORGANIZATION>Four Seasons Hotels Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> began searching for a location here six years ago and finally found the ultimate spot: posh <ORGANIZATION>Rodeo Drive</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Beverly Hills</LOCATION>. 
That is when <PERSON>Mr. Courtright</PERSON> was galvanized into action. 
The longtime owner of the <ORGANIZATION>Beverly Wilshire Hotel</ORGANIZATION>, diagonally across from the site desired by the Four Seasons, lobbied heavily against a city zoning change that would have permitted the project. 
<LOCATION>Beverly Hills</LOCATION> residents finally decided the issue at the polls, and the Four Seasons was sent packing. 
It wound up in a building just outside the <LOCATION>Beverly Hills</LOCATION> city limits. 

   The <ORGANIZATION>Beverly Wilshire</ORGANIZATION> itself was snapped up last year by <ORGANIZATION>Regent International Hotels</ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION>, for <MONEY>$125 million</MONEY>. 
The new owners are sinking <MONEY>$50 million</MONEY> into renovations so that all the rooms will soon feature such necessities as marble bathrooms -- just like the Four Seasons. 

   The high cost of keeping up with competition was a big factor in <PERSON>Marvin Davis</PERSON>'s decision to part with the pink-stuccoed <ORGANIZATION>Beverly Hills Hotel</ORGANIZATION> despite a strong personal attachment to the show-business hangout. 
After buying it from <PERSON>Mr. Boesky</PERSON> in <DATE>December 1986</DATE> for <MONEY>$136 million</MONEY> (after <PERSON>Mr. Boesky</PERSON> had agreed to pay the government <MONEY>$100 million</MONEY> to settle insider-trading charges), <PERSON>Mr. Davis</PERSON> explained that he wanted the hotel partly because he spent his honeymoon there and he used to live and conduct business in one of its bungalows. 

   In recent months, the portly billionaire usually could be found presiding over meals in the hotel's famous Polo Lounge from the vantage point of table No. 3, a high-profile spot near the door. 

   But after learning that renovating the sometimes musty 75-year-old hotel would cost more than twice the <MONEY>$40 million</MONEY> originally estimated, <PERSON>Mr. Davis</PERSON> readily accepted a bid of around <MONEY>$200 million</MONEY> from an offshore company said to be an alter ego of the sultan of <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION>. 
The sultan, ruler of a small oil country on <LOCATION>Borneo</LOCATION>, already owns the <ORGANIZATION>Dorchester Hotel</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>. 

   Another oil-rich innkeeper is <PERSON>Ms. Hunt</PERSON>, daughter of the late oil man <ORGANIZATION>H.L. Hunt</ORGANIZATION>. 
Her Hotel Bel-Air is the only hostelry here with a five-star rating from the <ORGANIZATION>Mobil Travel Guide</ORGANIZATION>. 
The mission-style hotel is set on 11 acres in a secluded canyon and features a pond filled with swans. 
Monaco's late Princess Grace and actress <PERSON>Kathleen Turner</PERSON> have been guests. 
<PERSON>Patti Davis</PERSON>, the president's daughter, was married there. 

   <PERSON>Ms. Hunt</PERSON>, who says owning a hotel means "you never have to feel lonely," had to compete against <PERSON>Mr. Boesky</PERSON> five years ago to buy the <LOCATION>Bel-Air</LOCATION>. 
It was a close call. 
<PERSON>Ms. Hunt</PERSON> won it with a bid a mere <MONEY>$8,370</MONEY> higher than <PERSON>Mr. Boesky</PERSON>'s. 

   She won, oddly enough, thanks to the suite number of her <ORGANIZATION>Rosewood Hotels Inc</ORGANIZATION>. 
Both sides had decided independently to bid <MONEY>$22.7 million</MONEY> plus a bit more. 
But <PERSON>Mr. Boesky</PERSON> set his bid at <MONEY>$22,729,000</MONEY> by using the numbers in his lawyer's birthday (<DATE>July 29</DATE>, or 7/29). 
<PERSON>Ms. Hunt</PERSON>'s team settled on a bid of <MONEY>$22,737,370</MONEY> because at the time <ORGANIZATION>Rosewood Hotels</ORGANIZATION> occupied suite <DATE>3737</DATE> in a downtown <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> office tower. 

   The hotel competition has inflicted some battle wounds. 
<PERSON>Mr. Ashkenazy</PERSON>, a Polish-born real-estate developer, opened five west-side luxury hotels in eight years amid criticism that the projects were creating a glut. 
"The west side is the creative heart and soul of <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>," <PERSON>Mr. Ashkenazy</PERSON> explains. 
But 20 months ago the hotelier's company filed for bankruptcy protection, blaming rapid expansion and a poor turnout for the <DATE>1984 summer</DATE> Olympics. 

   "He wanted to be <ORGANIZATION>Hilton</ORGANIZATION>, but even <PERSON>Mr. Hilton</PERSON> didn't open 10 hotels overnight," says <PERSON>Mr. Camus</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Westwood Marquis</ORGANIZATION>. 

   But the bankruptcy filing hasn't stopped <PERSON>Mr. Ashkenazy</PERSON>. 
He has since opened three additional hotels in <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> and plans to open his ninth area hotel next month. 
The <PERSON>Ashkenazy</PERSON> hotels are mavericks in the local market. 
The Mondrian, for example, is painted in a geometric pattern using 54 colors to resemble a Mondrian painting. 
The hotels are packed with original art from <PERSON>Mr. Ashkenazy</PERSON>'s personal collection, part of which he got in exchange for free rooms at his hotels. 

   Despite all the glitz, most of the luxury hotels compete mundanely, using direct mail, print advertising and appeals to travel agents. 
And most aren't above discounting. 
Although room rates range from <MONEY>$175</MONEY> to <MONEY>$3,000</MONEY> (for the Plaza Suite at the <ORGANIZATION>Century Plaza Hotel</ORGANIZATION>), many of the hotels give corporate discounts of <PERCENT>10%</PERCENT> or more. 
Many of the luxury hotels have raised prices by about <PERCENT>10%</PERCENT> in the past two years. 

   A battle on a smaller scale is taking place in bathrooms, which at newer hotels are increasingly bristling with free deodorant and perfumes. 
And that is causing some older hotels to review their bathroom supplies. 
The <LOCATION>Beverly Hills</LOCATION>, for example, is considering adding guest slippers. 

   Some guests clearly care more about a hotel's style than about bathroom amenities. 
<PERSON>Michael O'Donoghue</PERSON>, a former producer of "<DATE>Saturday</DATE> Night Live" and a founder of <ORGANIZATION>National Lampoon</ORGANIZATION>, recently stayed at the Chateau Marmont while working on a script. 
The hotel, built in the style of a French chateau, isn't big on amenities. 
The coffee, <PERSON>Mr. O'Donoghue</PERSON> says, is terrible. 

   "Ambiance is why I stay here. 
It has a sense of history," he explains. 
He says that the hotel staff doesn't turn down the sheets or leave little mints on the pillows at night, but that's all right. 
To trick a friend staying at the hotel into thinking that <PERSON>Mr. O'Donoghue</PERSON> was being treated better than his friend was, <PERSON>Mr. O'Donoghue</PERSON> once brought in his own box of mints and turned down the sheets himself.

   Non-Communist <LOCATION>Southeast Asia</LOCATION>
leaders are disappointed by talks in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> to end 10 years of war
in <LOCATION>Cambodia</LOCATION> but still hope for a peaceful settlement, <LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION>'s
prime minister said <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   The foreign ministers of 19 countries, who met this week in
<LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>, set up working committees to help monitor <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>'s
withdrawal from <LOCATION>Cambodia</LOCATION> and an ensuing cease-fire, deal with
sovereignty questions and plan for repatriation of refugees.
   But talks between Cambodian Premier <PERSON>Hun Sen</PERSON> and leaders of the
three-party Cambodian resistance alliance led by Prince <PERSON>Norodom
Sihanouk</PERSON> reached an impasse <DATE>July 25 after two days</DATE> of negotiations.
   The talks were aimed at bringing warring Cambodian factions
together and ensuring peace after <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> withdraws its troops from
<LOCATION>Cambodia</LOCATION>, which it has occupied since <DATE>December 1978</DATE>.
   ``We are a little bit disappointed,'' said Malaysian Prime
Minister <PERSON>Mahathir Mohammed</PERSON>. ``But we are realistic people. We know
we can't resolve things by sitting and looking at each other. More
discussions are needed.''
   Mahathir made the statement between meetings with Indonesian
President <PERSON>Suharto</PERSON>, President <PERSON>Corazon Aquino</PERSON> of the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION> and
Prime Minister <PERSON>Lee Kwan Yew</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION>.
   Mahathir is scheduled to meet Prime Minister <PERSON>Chatichai
Choonhavan</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION> when the Thai premier visits <LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION> on
<DATE>Friday</DATE>.
   Southeast Asian leaders were gathered here for <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>'s rites
symbolizing the ``coming of age'' of the eldest son of <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION>'s
<PERSON>Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah</PERSON>.
   <LOCATION>Indonesia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION> are
<LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION>'s partners in the <ORGANIZATION>Association of Southeast Asian Nations</ORGANIZATION> _
the main proponents of the <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> conference.
   ASEAN, <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and other Western countries back
<PERSON>Sihanouk</PERSON>'s alliance, which includes the <ORGANIZATION>Khmer Rouge</ORGANIZATION>, whom the
Vietnamese drove from power.
   Vietnam does not want the <ORGANIZATION>Khmer Rouge</ORGANIZATION>, blamed for slaughtering
hundreds of thousands of Cambodians during their three years in
power, to play a major role in any new government.
   In <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Hun Sen</PERSON> blamed the faction for the breakdown in talks
among the various Cambodian factions. He said the <ORGANIZATION>Khmer Rouge</ORGANIZATION>
refuses to resume the talks.
   ``This is a problem that cannot be resolved overnight or over
one month,'' <PERSON>Mahathir</PERSON> said. ``We've been working on it for years.''
   A spokesman for <PERSON>Suharto</PERSON> told reporters earlier that the
Indonesian president and <PERSON>Mahathir</PERSON> agreed during their meeting that
prospects for peace in <LOCATION>Cambodia</LOCATION> remain good.
   But the spokesman, <PERSON>Moerdiono</PERSON>, would not elaborate. He said
<PERSON>Mahathir</PERSON> and <PERSON>Suharto</PERSON> agreed to meet again in <LOCATION>Bali</LOCATION> later this year
to review the Cambodian situation and discuss other issues.

HOT PROPERTY: 'HOT LIPS' KISSING MANSION GOODBY

<P>
<PERSON>LORETTA SWIT</PERSON>, probably best known for her television role as nurse "Hot Lips" 
<PERSON>Houlihan</PERSON> in MASH, and her husband, actor <PERSON>Dennis Holahan</PERSON>, have put their Bel-Air 
house on the market. 
</P>
<P>
"They're selling to get something smaller or more manageable," said <PERSON>Joe Coons</PERSON> 
of <ORGANIZATION>Merrill Lynch/Rodeo Realty</ORGANIZATION>, who shares the <MONEY>$2,495,000</MONEY> listing with <ORGANIZATION>Merrill 
Lynch</ORGANIZATION>'s Beverlywood office. 
</P>
<P>
The <LOCATION>Santa</LOCATION> Fe-style house has three bedrooms and maids' quarters. The 2.2-acre 
property has a lot of privacy, <PERSON>Coons</PERSON> said, with its 300-foot-long driveway and 
eucalyptus and pine trees. It also has a pool. 
</P>
<P>
The recently remodeled house is about 25 years old, and <PERSON>Swit</PERSON> and <PERSON>Holahan</PERSON> have 
owned it for two. Coons described the <LOCATION>Bel-Air</LOCATION> home as "a showplace, like a 
gentleman's ranch house with an early-California flair." 
</P>
<P>
The SULTAN OF <LOCATION>BRUNEI</LOCATION> has purchased two new houses next to his Beverly Hills 
Hotel, sources say. No wonder both houses were painted pink, like the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
The houses are really like one home, because there are steps between them, both 
are <LOCATION>Mediterranean</LOCATION> in style and they are behind gates. The compound -- with a 
total of eight bedrooms and 18,000 square feet on almost 2 acres -- sold for 
more than <MONEY>$10 million</MONEY>. 
</P>
<P>
A real estate agent who asked for anonymity said the sultan bought the houses, 
just behind the hotel, "so he can get service from the hotel without taking up 
hotel rooms." 
</P>
<P>
When the sultan bought the hotel, he had plans to close it in increments for 
remodeling, but no rooms have been closed "because the hotel is running at a 
high occupancy, anyway," another source said. The sultan bought the hotel in 
<DATE>October, 1987</DATE>, for about <MONEY>$186 million</MONEY>. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>James Northcutt</PERSON> is decorating the sultan's compound, which was a project of 
<ORGANIZATION>Columbia Residential Development</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The race is on at <LOCATION>Hollywood Park</LOCATION> for <PERSON>WALDO FERNANDEZ</PERSON>, who has designed homes 
for <PERSON>Merv Griffin</PERSON> and other celebrities as well as the ballroom of <PERSON>Griffin</PERSON>'s 
<LOCATION>Beverly Hilton</LOCATION>, to complete new interiors for the <ORGANIZATION>Turf Club</ORGANIZATION> and Directors Wing 
by <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, opening day of thoroughbred racing. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Marge Everett</PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION>Hollywood Park</ORGANIZATION>, chose 
<PERSON>Fernandez</PERSON> to redo the rooms. The decor of the <DATE>1938</DATE> landmark hadn't been touched 
since the early <DATE>1950s</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
The 30,000-square-foot <ORGANIZATION>Turf Club</ORGANIZATION> is being transformed into an English hunting 
club setting, with dark wood paneling, red booths and brown carpet with 
polished brass trim. The 15,000-square-foot <ORGANIZATION>Directors Wing</ORGANIZATION>, above the <ORGANIZATION>Turf 
Club</ORGANIZATION>, is being redecorated in blue and white with a powder-blue patterned 
carpet and light blue, white and gray wall coverings. 
</P>
<P>
Among the regulars at the <ORGANIZATION>Turf Club</ORGANIZATION>, are <PERSON>Marvin Davis</PERSON>, <PERSON>Richard Pryor</PERSON>, <PERSON>Carole</PERSON> 
and <PERSON>Burt Bacharach</PERSON>, <PERSON>Walter Matthau</PERSON>, <PERSON>Jackie Collins</PERSON>, <PERSON>Tim Conway</PERSON>, <PERSON>John Forsythe</PERSON>, 
<PERSON>Jill St. John</PERSON>, <PERSON>Jack Klugman</PERSON> -- and Merv. 
</P>
<P>
Good news for preservationists, and timely -- since the <ORGANIZATION>California Preservation 
Foundation</ORGANIZATION> is winding up its conference today at the Biltmore Hotel: 
</P>
<P>
Sale of a 60-year-old, 5-acre villa in Silver Lake to a developer who might 
have razed it, has fallen through, and the property, designated a city landmark 
last <DATE>October</DATE> as a means of saving it for another six months, is for sale again. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Christie McAvoy</PERSON>, preservation officer for the <ORGANIZATION>Los Angeles Conservancy</ORGANIZATION>, said, 
"We're real interested that it's back on the market, and we'll be looking to 
see if we can interest some people in preserving the buildings." 
</P>
<P>
The villa, at <DATE>1923</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>Micheltorena St.</ORGANIZATION>, was built by silent-movie star <PERSON>Antonio 
Moreno</PERSON>. It is owned by the Franciscan Missionary Sisters of the <ORGANIZATION>Immaculate 
Conception</ORGANIZATION>, who operated a home there for wayward and homeless girls from the 
<DATE>1950s</DATE> until the <DATE>October, 1987</DATE> earthquake left cracks in the main building. 
</P>
<P>
CITY COUNCILMAN <PERSON>MICHAEL</PERSON> WOO has said that the estate "probably has more 
potential for a sensitive, adaptive reuse than any property within a 5-mile 
radius of downtown." It also has been termed ideal for an AIDS hospice. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Margaret Verguzco</PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION>Valley View Realty Inc.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>San Fernando</LOCATION> has the listing at 
<MONEY>$6.5 million</MONEY> but said, "There is an urgent need to sell, and the sisters are 
open to offers because they need to build a preschool in <LOCATION>Sylmar</LOCATION> for the poor 
living in the northeastern part of the <LOCATION>San Fernando Valley</LOCATION>."

   South African anti-apartheid
leader <PERSON>Nelson Mandela</PERSON> received a <MONEY>$5 million</MONEY> contribution from
<LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION> and other aid pledges before leaving for <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION> on <DATE>Sunday</DATE>.
   Mandela, near the end of two-week tour of six nations, said the
money will help fund <ORGANIZATION>African National Congress</ORGANIZATION> efforts while its
leaders negotiate with the government to end racial segregation
policies.
   Mandela, 72, attended a dinner in his honor <DATE>Saturday</DATE> in the
capital of <LOCATION>Kuala Lumpur</LOCATION>. He also received other pledges of
assistance, including aid to build housing for more than 20,000
political prisoners expected to be released soon.
   In <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Mandela</ORGANIZATION>'s last stop on the international trip, he was
greeted by <PERSON>Prince Mohamad Bolkiah</PERSON>, the foreign minister of the
small Asian nation.
   On <DATE>Monday</DATE>, <PERSON>Prince Mohamad</PERSON> is scheduled to host a lunch in
<LOCATION>Mandela</LOCATION>'s honor. Later, <ORGANIZATION>Mandela</ORGANIZATION> will meet with <PERSON>Sultan Hassanal
Bolkiah</PERSON> in <PERSON>Bandar Seri Begawan</PERSON>, the capital.
   Mandela also visited <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Indonesia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>.
   Mandela said <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> had promised <MONEY>$15 million</MONEY>; <LOCATION>Indonesia</LOCATION> $<MONEY>10
million</MONEY> and <ORGANIZATION>India</ORGANIZATION> <MONEY>$6.5 million</MONEY>.
   Mandela, however, complained <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> did not make any financial
contribution to the <ORGANIZATION>ANC</ORGANIZATION>.
   Prime Minister <PERSON>Toshiki Kaifu</PERSON> said <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> could not provide aid to
the <ORGANIZATION>ANC</ORGANIZATION> because of its policy of not giving assistance to political
parties in other nations. But <PERSON>Kaifu</PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION>Mandela Japan</ORGANIZATION> would
provide aid to grass-roots South African groups.

North About Fund-Raising for Contras

<TEXT>
   Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON>Elliott Abrams</PERSON> testified that he repeatedly failed to question Marine Lt. Col. <PERSON>Oliver North</PERSON> about his involvement with Nicaraguan insurgents -- even though Secretary of State <PERSON>George Shultz</PERSON> instructed him to "monitor Ollie." 

   <PERSON>Mr. Abrams</PERSON> recalled that in <DATE>September 1985</DATE> <PERSON>Mr. Shultz</PERSON> told him that "you've got to know" what Col. North's activities were. 
Yet the assistant secretary testified that he never specifically questioned the former <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> aide about what he was doing with respect to fund-raising for the Contras. 

   Even when a plane with an American crew was shot down last <DATE>October</DATE> while flying arms to the insurgents, <PERSON>Mr. Abrams</PERSON> said, he didn't question Col. North directly about his involvement with the airlift before assuring <PERSON>Mr. Shultz</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> that the operation had no connection to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> government. 

   "I was careful not to ask Col. North what questions I thought I did not need to know the answers to," <PERSON>Mr. Abrams</PERSON> said. 
But he rejected suggestions he had sought to shield the Marine officer and the covert arms network. 
In a sharp exchange, the assistant secretary also denied he had withheld information from <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> last fall regarding a Swiss bank account linked to <ORGANIZATION>Col. North</ORGANIZATION>. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Abrams</PERSON> is the highest ranking official in the <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> administration yet to testify before <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> committees investigating the Iran-Contra affair, and his interrogation was full of details and sometimes combative. 
On a series of separate points, the assistant secretary found himself at odds with the testimony of prior witnesses. 

   Accompanied by his wife and mother, he reminded members in opening remarks of his past ties to prominent Democrats. 
But in his carefully crafted answers to questions, he was forced more often to fall back on his Harvard legal education. 

   Appointed assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs in <DATE>July 1985</DATE>, <PERSON>Mr. Abrams</PERSON> was a lead figure in guiding the administration's <LOCATION>Central America</LOCATION> policy during the <DATE>last 15 months</DATE> of a two-year ban on <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> military aid to the Nicaraguan insurgents. 
Telephone logs examined by investigators show <PERSON>Mr. Abrams</PERSON> was in frequent contact with <LOCATION>Col. North</LOCATION> during this period. 

   The fired <ORGANIZATION>National Security Council</ORGANIZATION> aide was part of the <ORGANIZATION>Restricted Interagency Group</ORGANIZATION>, or RIG, of which <PERSON>Mr. Abrams</PERSON> was chairman. 
The assistant secretary played down the importance of the group. 
But records cited by the committees show that in the <DATE>first six months of 1986</DATE>, there were as many as 11 meetings of RIG, or a smaller subgroup, that included <PERSON>Mr. Abrams</PERSON>, Col. North and the head of the <ORGANIZATION>Central Intelligence Agency</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Central America Task Force</ORGANIZATION>. 

   Other witnesses previously have suggested this smaller group was a focal point for <ORGANIZATION>Col. North</ORGANIZATION>'s efforts, but <PERSON>Mr. Abrams</PERSON> portrayed himself as having only tangential knowledge of the Contra supply network's activities. 

   He said he knew as early as <DATE>August</DATE> or <DATE>September 1985</DATE> about plans to build an airstrip in <LOCATION>Costa Rica</LOCATION> to help furnish arms to the Contras. 
But he denied that he knew that the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION>Costa Rica</LOCATION> was involved in negotiating an agreement with that country's government regarding use of the land. 

   Contradicting the testimony of former Ambassador <PERSON>Lewis Tambs</PERSON>, <PERSON>Mr. Abrams</PERSON> said he didn't recall discussing the airstrip with the <LOCATION>Costa Rica</LOCATION> envoy in <DATE>1985</DATE>. 
He also denied ever being told that Col. North instructed the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Embassy</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION> to work secretly to open a new Contra military front in southern <LOCATION>Nicaragua</LOCATION>. 

   The assistant secretary said that in <DATE>1986</DATE> he participated in two events linked to fund-raising efforts by <PERSON>Carl</PERSON> "Spitz" <PERSON>Channell</PERSON>. 
But he insisted he wasn't aware that <PERSON>Mr. Channell</PERSON>'s organization was funneling money to support the covert air operation running arms to the Contras. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Abrams</PERSON>'s assessment of <ORGANIZATION>Col. North</ORGANIZATION> often appeared ambivalent. 
He dismissed criticism that the former aide was a "loose cannon," but complained that the Marine officer hadn't kept him better informed. 

   In one episode carrying echoes of <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>, the assistant secretary said Col. North proposed last year that the Contras stage their own "Khe Sanh" by capturing a major province on <LOCATION>Nicaragua</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> coast, and then forcing a desperate standoff with government forces. 
<PERSON>Mr. Abrams</PERSON> said the plan, though never accepted, was seen by <ORGANIZATION>Col. North</ORGANIZATION> as a dramatic way to win public support for the Contras by showing the rebels fighting and dying in a standoff similar to the <ORGANIZATION>Marine</ORGANIZATION> battle two decades ago. 

   Months later, <PERSON>Mr. Abrams</PERSON> said, he chose Col. North, rather than the <ORGANIZATION>CIA</ORGANIZATION>, as the conduit for a foreign contribution to the Contras. 
The assistant secretary said he met in <DATE>August 1986</DATE> with a representative of the Sultan of <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION> in a <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> park. 
Using the pseudonym "Kennilworth," he said he solicited <MONEY>$10 million</MONEY> in "humanitarian" aid for the Contras. 
He said the goal was to provide funds to carry the insurgent forces over to the <DATE>fall</DATE>, when <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> military aid would resume. 
But rather than use an account offered by the <ORGANIZATION>CIA</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Abrams</PERSON> passed on the number of a Swiss account given to him by <ORGANIZATION>Col. North</ORGANIZATION>. 

   But <PERSON>Mr. Abrams</PERSON> said he never questioned Col. North about the origin of the account number or about who controlled it. 
While he understood the account was linked to the Contras, he never asked the insurgent leaders if they knew about the account, which also proved to be a conduit for the profits of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> arms sales to <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION>. 

   Through an apparently innocent error, the money was deposited in the wrong account in <LOCATION>Switzerland</LOCATION>. 
"There's <MONEY>$10 million</MONEY> of missing money that you say was supposed to go into a bank account owned by the Contras, and you never asked them if they got the money?" asked <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> counsel <PERSON>John Nields</PERSON>. 

   "I repeatedly asked Col. North, whom I trusted implicitly," <PERSON>Mr. Abrams</PERSON> answered, but he bristled when <PERSON>Mr. Nields</PERSON>'s added, "Because it was Col. North's Swiss account . . . and you knew that, didn't you, sir?" 

   "<PERSON>Mr. 
Nields</PERSON>, you can state that 45 times," <PERSON>Mr. Abrams</PERSON> replied. 
"It wouldn't be any truer than it is the first time. . . 
It is false." 
The money has since been found, and the Sultan reportedly is seeking to reclaim it. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Abrams</PERSON> conceded that he misled three congressional committees last fall about the promised donation to the Contras from <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION>. 
But he asserted he had done so because he "lacked authority" to reveal the gift, and said he later apologized to the <ORGANIZATION>Senate Intelligence Committee</ORGANIZATION>. 

   On <DATE>Nov. 25, 1986</DATE>, the day Attorney General <PERSON>Edwin Meese</PERSON> disclosed that funds from secret Iranian arms sales had been diverted to the Contras, <PERSON>Mr. Abrams</PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION>Senate Intelligence</ORGANIZATION> panel that he'd never discussed "the problems of fund-raising by the Contras with members of the (<ORGANIZATION>National Security Council</ORGANIZATION>) staff." 
Yesterday, <PERSON>Mr. Abrams</PERSON> conceded that he'd discussed the <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION> donation with Col. North, but hadn't disclosed it because that was fund-raising "for" the Contras, not "by" them. 

   He also said he told the <ORGANIZATION>Senate Intelligence</ORGANIZATION> panel that "there was no foreign government contributing" to the Contras because the <MONEY>$10 million</MONEY> promised by the Sultan of <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION> hadn't actually reached the insurgents. 
Those answers, he admitted, were "technically correct and perhaps misleading." 

   "I consider this testimony to have been a great mistake; it was the worst day I had in six years as an assistant secretary," <PERSON>Mr. Abrams</PERSON> said. 
"And that is precisely why I went back to the committee to tell them about the solicitation and then apologized to the committee." 
He made the apology last <DATE>Dec. 8</DATE>. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Abrams</PERSON> said he got the first inkling that <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> officials were supporting the Contra airlift more than two weeks after the supply plane was shot down in <DATE>October 1986</DATE>. 
He said the <ORGANIZATION>CIA</ORGANIZATION>'s chief of operations for <LOCATION>Latin America</LOCATION> told him that the agency suspected its station chief in <LOCATION>Costa Rica</LOCATION> was involved with the resupply effort. 
The <ORGANIZATION>CIA</ORGANIZATION> official said the station chief was trying to destroy telephone records linking him to the airlift, <PERSON>Mr. Abrams</PERSON> said. 
The <ORGANIZATION>CIA</ORGANIZATION>'s deputy director of operations, <PERSON>Clair George</PERSON>, "was livid," the assistant secretary claimed. 
The station chief, who gave testimony in closed-door session <DATE>Friday</DATE>, said his superiors knew what he was doing and never firmly ordered him to stop. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Abrams</PERSON>'s appearance came as the investigating committees neared a vote on whether to grant immunity to Col. North to compel him to testify. 
The panels previously agreed with independent counsel <PERSON>Lawrence Walsh</PERSON> that they wouldn't vote on immunity for the fired <ORGANIZATION>NSC</ORGANIZATION> aide before this week. 
But <PERSON>Mr. Walsh</PERSON> is expected to seek a further delay when he meets with the lawmakers at a lunch scheduled for today.

FT  27 OCT 94 / Government Ethics Row: The implausible guardian of morals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PLENDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<PERSON>Mr Mohamed Fayed</PERSON>, the Egyptian-born businessman who runs the Harrods
department store in <LOCATION>Knightsbridge</LOCATION>, is an implausible guardian of British
public morals. Yet it cannot be denied that he has shown a remarkable and
consistent knack of exposing double standards in the <LOCATION>City</LOCATION>, government and
the press.
Before the mid-1980s, when he and his brothers came to public attention
because of their bid for the <ORGANIZATION>House of Fraser</ORGANIZATION> stores group, <PERSON>Mr Fayed</PERSON> had sat
on the board of <PERSON>Mr Tiny Rowland</PERSON>'s controversial international conglomerate,
<ORGANIZATION>Lonrho</ORGANIZATION>, and acted as a middleman for British contractors in the <LOCATION>Gulf</LOCATION>. How he
progressed from there to acquiring sufficient funds to launch a cash bid
that valued <ORGANIZATION>House of Fraser</ORGANIZATION> at Pounds 615m has never been satisfactorily
explained.
Leading merchant bankers in the <LOCATION>City</LOCATION> were nonetheless prepared to take this
potentially lucrative client at his own valuation. Chief among them were
<PERSON>Kleinwort Benson</PERSON>, one of whose then directors, <PERSON>Mr John MacArthur</PERSON>, declared
on television at the time that he personally knew the net worth of the
Fayeds to be <MONEY>several billion dollars</MONEY>. In the light of subsequent events the
inquiries that supported this assertion appear to have been less than
rigorous.
Nor did the <ORGANIZATION>Department of Trade</ORGANIZATION> or the <ORGANIZATION>Office of Fair Trading</ORGANIZATION> look far into
the Fayeds' background. The secretary of state, <PERSON>Mr Norman</PERSON> (now Lord) <PERSON>Tebbit</PERSON>,
waved through the bid within 10 days, relying heavily on the names of the
professional advisers, who included <ORGANIZATION>City</ORGANIZATION> lawyers <PERSON>Herbert Smith</PERSON> alongside
<PERSON>Kleinworts</PERSON>.
The press was equally uncritical, giving credence to stories circulated by
City public relations man <PERSON>Mr Brian Basham</PERSON>. The Fayeds' fortune, according to
<PERSON>Mr Basham</PERSON>, derived from a cotton empire founded by their great grandfather
in the <DATE>19th century</DATE>, which then expanded into shipping as they exported
their wares to the mills of <LOCATION>Lancashire</LOCATION>.
The first indication that these stories were questionable emerged when <PERSON>Mr
Rowland</PERSON>, who believed that the Fayeds had deceived him over their intention
to buy <LOCATION>Harrods</LOCATION>, started a public campaign to discredit the brothers, dubbing
them 'the phoney pharoahs'. Subsequent independent inquiries by the
<ORGANIZATION>Financial Times</ORGANIZATION> and a Channel Four television documentary did indeed
discover that the Fayed brothers' origins and funds were not what they
claimed.
The findings were later confirmed by a <ORGANIZATION>Department of Trade</ORGANIZATION> inspectors
report. The inspectors concluded that the Fayeds 'dishonestly misrepresented
their origins, their wealth, their business interests and their resources to
the secretary of state, the <ORGANIZATION>Office of Fair Trading</ORGANIZATION>, the press, the <ORGANIZATION>House of
Fraser</ORGANIZATION> board and <ORGANIZATION>House of Fraser</ORGANIZATION> shareholders, and their own advisers'.
Among other things, it emerged that <PERSON>Mr Mohamed Fayed</PERSON>'s colourful past
included an adventure in the <DATE>1960s</DATE> in which he absconded with Dollars
100,000 belonging to the Haitian government of '<ORGANIZATION>Papa Doc</ORGANIZATION>' <PERSON>Duvalier</PERSON>. He was
known in this impoverished <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> country as a Kuwaiti sheikh.
The Arab equivalent of the particule nobiliaire - Mohamed 'Al' Fayed - was
adopted in the early <DATE>1970s</DATE>. By the <DATE>1980s</DATE> <PERSON>Mr Fayed</PERSON> had become an adviser to
the Sultan of <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION>. Through a power of attorney he also had access to the
Sultan's bank account. While the <ORGANIZATION>DTI</ORGANIZATION> inspectors were unable to prove that
the Sultan's money paid for the bid, they concluded that this was the most
likely explanation for the Fayed brothers' sudden ability to finance a huge
takeover bid.
The connection with the <PERSON>Sultan</PERSON> also opened important doors, notably that of
No 10 Downing Street before the bid. <PERSON>Mr Fayed</PERSON> has claimed in the press that
he was instrumental in persuading the Sultan not to withdraw <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION>'s funds
from sterling. He also claims to have persuaded the Sultan not to take
defence contracts elsewhere.
Despite the fact that the Fayed brothers clearly deceived the government, no
action was taken by ministers to disqualify them as directors of a public
company. This inertia has never been satisfactorily explained, although the
late <PERSON>Nicholas Ridley</PERSON>, when trade and industry secretary, justified the
decision not to pursue the brothers by saying that no shareholder had
suffered and that the matter was trivial.
What was not made public at the time was that <PERSON>Mr Fayed</PERSON> had privately donated
Pounds 250,000 to Tory party funds. Whether the new independent commission
of inquiry under <PERSON>Lord Nolan</PERSON> will take such a relaxed view remains to be
seen. The grant of money to Tory party funds was confirmed to the <ORGANIZATION>Financial
Times</ORGANIZATION> by a spokesman for <PERSON>Mr Fayed</PERSON> last week. It appears to cast the
government's weak response to the <ORGANIZATION>DTI</ORGANIZATION> inspectors' findings in a new and
dramatic light.
Nor have the inspectors' findings loosened all ties with the <ORGANIZATION>Fayeds</ORGANIZATION>'
professional and establishment friends. <PERSON>Herbert Smith</PERSON> continued to act for
<PERSON>Mr Mohamed Fayed</PERSON>'s business interests after the publication of the
inspectors' report - this despite the report's revelation that a <PERSON>Herbert
Smith</PERSON> partner had been systematically deceived on a trip to <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION> to inquire
into the Fayeds' origins and wealth.
While <PERSON>Kleinwort Benson</PERSON> parted company with <ORGANIZATION>House of Fraser</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Mr MacArthur</PERSON>
continued to act as a consultant to the Fayeds. Nor was former minister <PERSON>Mr
Neil Hamilton</PERSON> alone in having enjoyed hospitality at the <ORGANIZATION>Fayeds</ORGANIZATION>' <LOCATION>Paris Ritz</LOCATION>.
Several establishment and showbusiness personalities went there when <PERSON>Mr
Fayed</PERSON> completed the restoration of the late Duke of <LOCATION>Windsor</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> home.
So, too, did leading journalists. There is a striking correlation between a
number of the beneficiaries of this largesse and uncritical press comment,
including the designation of <PERSON>Mr Fayed</PERSON> as <ORGANIZATION>Mohamed 'Al</ORGANIZATION>' Fayed.
The Queen, meanwhile, continues to meet <PERSON>Mr Fayed</PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION>Windsor Horse Show</ORGANIZATION>,
which derives support from <LOCATION>Harrods</LOCATION>.
Although the Fayed brothers have spent large sums in an attempt to
rehabilitate their reputation, they have never sued those in the media who
revealed their deceptions before publication of the <ORGANIZATION>DTI</ORGANIZATION> inspectors' report,
which enjoys qualified privilege in terms of libel.
Nor did their case against the <ORGANIZATION>DTI</ORGANIZATION> inspectors in the <ORGANIZATION>European Court of Human
Rights</ORGANIZATION> meet with success - in spite of the court's known reservations about
the department's investigation process.
<PERSON>Mr Fayed</PERSON> has frequently claimed that he wants British justice. Given that he
has never refuted the claims produced by his critics, the question <PERSON>Lord

<DESCRIPT>  PAST; OFFICIAL; TRIAL; RESULT; WASHINGTON-DC  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  Prosecutors today filed two criminal misdemeanor charges against former State
Department official Elliott Abrams, accusing him of withholding information
from Congress about the Iran-Contra scandal.;   One charge accuses Abrams of
not telling the Senate Foreign Relations Committee what he knew about Oliver
North's secret network to resupply the Nicaraguan Contras.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The second charge contends <PERSON>Abrams</PERSON> covered up his solicitation of <MONEY>$10
million</MONEY> from the country of <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION> for the Contras.;   The charges were filed
less than three days before a statute of limitations would have prevented
prosecutors from seeking charges on most federal crimes. Abrams' first
congressional appearance on Iran-Contra was on <DATE>Oct. 10</DATE>, 1986.;   He is the
only <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION> official to be charged in the Iran-Contra scandal. A
court appearance was scheduled later today before <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> District <PERSON>Judge Aubrey
Robinson.</PERSON>;   The 11 pages of criminal charges say that <PERSON>Abrams</PERSON> met frequently
with <ORGANIZATION>North</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Alan Fiers</PERSON>, then chief of the <ORGANIZATION>CIA</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Central American Task
Force</ORGANIZATION>, and discussed the Contras.;   <PERSON>Abrams</PERSON> "knew that Lt. Col. North had been
in contact with people supplying the Contras, had conversations with people
supplying the Contras, and had asked and encouraged them to supply the
Contras," said documents filed with the charges.;   But when <PERSON>Abrams</PERSON> went
before the foreign relations committee on <DATE>Oct. 10, 1986</DATE>, he said that <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
government officials had stayed away from the <ORGANIZATION>Contra</ORGANIZATION> resupply network.;   In
doing so, <PERSON>Abrams</PERSON> "unlawfully withheld material information from the <LOCATION>United
States Senate</LOCATION> committee," according to the documents, called a criminal
information.;   On the second charge, prosecutors said <PERSON>Abrams</PERSON> requested <MONEY>$10
million</MONEY> from the sultan of <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION> in <DATE>August 1986</DATE>. In <DATE>September 1986</DATE>, <PERSON>Abrams</PERSON>
was told that the sultan had sent the money to a Swiss bank account on the
Contras' behalf, according to the court documents.;   But when <PERSON>Abrams</PERSON>
testified on <DATE>Oct. 14, 1986</DATE>, before the <ORGANIZATION>House Intelligence Committee</ORGANIZATION>, he
"unlawfully withheld material information" about the request to Brunei.;   The
chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>House Intelligence Committee</ORGANIZATION> asked <PERSON>Abrams</PERSON> on that date whether
it was false that third countries were helping to supply the Contras.;   "Yes,
it is . . . false," <PERSON>Abrams</PERSON> told the committee.;   <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> cut off military
assistance to the Contras from <DATE>October 1984</DATE> to <DATE>October 1986</DATE>. During much of
that time, <PERSON>Abrams</PERSON> "dealt with . . . <PERSON>Mr. Fiers</PERSON> and Lt. Col. North on Central
American issues and . . . discussed sensitive matters relating to <LOCATION>Central
America</LOCATION> with them," independent counsel <PERSON>Lawrence Walsh</PERSON> said in the 11-page
document filed with the court.;   <ORGANIZATION>Fiers</ORGANIZATION> pleaded guilty in <DATE>July</DATE> to two counts
of withholding information from <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> on Iran-Contra. He is cooperating
with <PERSON>Walsh</PERSON>'s investigation.;   North, a <ORGANIZATION>National Security Council</ORGANIZATION> aide,
started a secret supply operation to deliver arms to the Contras after
<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> cut off military assistance.;   North, <PERSON>Fiers</PERSON>, and <PERSON>Abrams</PERSON> formed an
inner circle that kept tabs on the Contras. But <PERSON>Abrams</PERSON> has always maintained
that he never knew North was overseeing a secret network.;   <ORGANIZATION>Fiers</ORGANIZATION> says he had
detailed knowledge of <ORGANIZATION>North</ORGANIZATION>'s role in the resupply operation. And entries in
<LOCATION>North</LOCATION>'s daily notebooks suggest he disclosed his role to Abrams.;   North's
Contra resupply network started to come unraveled on <DATE>Oct. 5, 1986</DATE>, when a
plane in the operation was shot down over <LOCATION>Nicaragua</LOCATION> while delivering 10,000
pounds of ammunition and gear to the Contras.;   <PERSON>Abrams</PERSON> made three appearances
in a five-day span before congressional committees, each time denying that the
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> government had any connection to the flight. He said he checked with
<PERSON>Fiers</PERSON> and North aide <PERSON>Robert Earl</PERSON> before giving the assurances.;   "I and
others . . . inquired of <ORGANIZATION>CIA</ORGANIZATION>, inquired of <ORGANIZATION>NSC</ORGANIZATION>, inquired of <ORGANIZATION>DOD</ORGANIZATION> . . . and
everybody said . . . there was no <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> government role," <PERSON>Abrams</PERSON> told the
Iran-Contra congressional investigating committees in <DATE>1987.</DATE>;   <PERSON>Abrams</PERSON> later
acknowledged that his statements were "completely wrong" but said he was just
another person who had been deceived by <LOCATION>North.</LOCATION>;   <PERSON>Abrams</PERSON> was one of the <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>
administration's most outspoken supporters of the Contras. As assistant
secretary of state for inter-American affairs from 1985-89, he was the senior
<ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION> official focusing on <LOCATION>Latin America</LOCATION>. He was first appointed to
an assistant secretary post at age 33 in <DATE>1981</DATE>, the youngest person in <ORGANIZATION>State
Department</ORGANIZATION> history to hold a position at that level.  </TEXT>

Congress Gets a Lesson</HL>

<TEXT>
   The Iran-Contra panel yesterday received its best testimony so far about how the Contras were kept alive while <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> aid was suspended. 
If the members had listened carefully, they would have learned that their micromanaging of <LOCATION>Nicaragua</LOCATION> policy was at least as big a problem as <ORGANIZATION>Ollie North</ORGANIZATION>'s entrepreneurship. 
We only hope this bitter lesson will not lead them to assassinate the reputation of witness <PERSON>Elliott Abrams</PERSON> out of spite. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Abrams</PERSON>, the assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs, is one of the young stars of the <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> administration. 
At the age of 39, he is in his third post as an assistant secretary of state. 
He told the panel how he tried to help the Contras while abiding by fluctuating congressional restrictions. 
What was most interesting was to listen to his detailed answers about how foreign policy is made in modern <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>. 

   In going over the history of congressional restrictions on <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> aid for the Contras, <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> counsel <PERSON>Mark Belnick</PERSON> referred to the <DATE>August 1985</DATE> version of the <LOCATION>Boland</LOCATION> amendment, which authorized <MONEY>$27 million</MONEY> in humanitarian aid. 
He noted that <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> made the <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION> the conduit for the funds. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Abrams</PERSON>: "I think it's worth noting that that was done over our dead body. 
We all, from the secretary on down, felt that that was crazy. 
What did the <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION> know about buying boots and shipping them down to <LOCATION>Central America</LOCATION>? 
It would take us months to set up an office from scratch, to figure out how we do this. 
There were two agencies of government that do it, that know how to do it, that know how to account for it, that are all set: <ORGANIZATION>CIA</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Defense Department</ORGANIZATION>. 
And we fought and fought to not have to do this and to try to persuade <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> that this was not a sensible thing to do and we lost." 

   <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> forced the wrong executive-branch department to oversee <ORGANIZATION>Contra</ORGANIZATION> aid. 
This oversight entailed rather bizarre considerations that had nothing to do with effectively running foreign policy. 
Take the Case of the <ORGANIZATION>Nonlethal Timepieces</ORGANIZATION>. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Abrams</PERSON> recalled a request from the Contras for wristwatches: "I remember us saying, well, you know unless you've got a very large wristwatch and hit somebody with it, it was not lethal aid. 
But this was deadly serious, deadly serious, because of legal restrictions. 
And we actually debated, of course wristwatches weren't 'lethal aid,' but were they 'humanitarian aid?' 
Did they fit, because we thought <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> basically meant uniforms, medicine and food. . . . 
I decided, yeah, a wristwatch is OK. 
But that was the kind of discussion that we had -- was that doable?" 

   The <ORGANIZATION>Tower Commission</ORGANIZATION> made similar points about how the <LOCATION>Boland</LOCATION> amendments and the immersion of foreign policy in trivial legalities contributed to Iran-Contra. 
The <ORGANIZATION>CIA</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Defense Department</ORGANIZATION> were prohibited from participating. 
State was told to run the humanitarian-aid program, despite its objection that this made no sense. 
Then <PERSON>Mr. Abrams</PERSON> had to fall back on his <ORGANIZATION>Harvard Law</ORGANIZATION> degree to parse the confused language of <LOCATION>Boland</LOCATION>. 

   After all this, the case against <PERSON>Mr. Abrams</PERSON> is being reduced to another legalism. 
<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> expressly had authorized the <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION> to solicit humanitarian aid from third countries as part of the <DATE>1986</DATE> Intelligence Authorization Act. 
Yet reports say special prosecutor <PERSON>Lawrence Walsh</PERSON> is thinking about indicting <PERSON>Mr. Abrams</PERSON> for lying to <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> about <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> solicitation of aid from <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION>. 
This seems to boil down to a claim that <PERSON>Mr. Abrams</PERSON> did not tell <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> about the sultan of <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION> quickly enough. 
"We promised confidentiality to <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION>," <PERSON>Mr. Abrams</PERSON> said. 
He said he told <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> about the solicitation as soon as he got permission from Secretary <PERSON>Shultz</PERSON>. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Abrams</PERSON> resumes his testimony today. 
The members can keep berating him for not informing them more quickly about the sultan. 
They can keep insinuating that he lied. 
Or they can discuss with him how <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> can stay involved in foreign policy without getting so involved that it forces the executive branch into semisecret policy making. 

   While the Iranamok terriers are running the <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION> Connection to ground, we suggest that the rest of the country consider how <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> foreign policy stumbled into its current swamp. 
Congressional Democrats and a few free-lance Republicans such as <PERSON>Sen. William Cohen</PERSON> don't like executive-branch foreign policy, so they decide to run their own. 
Using the legislative process, they write up policy with about the same clarity they imposed on the Environmental Policy Act. 
So ordered, the secretary and an assistant secretary of state spend their days setting up quartermaster operations and defining how wristwatches fit within the ambit of congressional foreign policy. 
This is a mess. 
We trust that those viewing these hearings will be able to decide who created it.
