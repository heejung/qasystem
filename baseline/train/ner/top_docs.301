<P>
The <PERSON>Cleveland Browns</PERSON>, off to their worst start since <DATE>1984</DATE>, fired <ORGANIZATION>Coach Bud 
Carson</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Monday</DATE>, the day after their worst home loss ever. 
</P>
<P>
Owner Art <PERSON>Modell</PERSON>, who promised last year that <PERSON>Carson</PERSON> would be his last head 
coach, changed his mind after <DATE>Sunday</DATE>'s 42-0 loss to the <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> Bills. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an embarrassment for all of us," <PERSON>Modell</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
Carson, the first coaching casualty of the season, was replaced by offensive 
coordinator <PERSON>Jim Shofner</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
Modell asked <PERSON>Shofner</PERSON> to take over for at least the rest of the season. He 
becomes the <PERSON>Browns</PERSON>' ninth head coach. Carson's three-year contract runs through 
<DATE>1991</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Carson</PERSON> said <DATE>Monday</DATE> he thought the <PERSON>Browns</PERSON> (2-7) were back on track when they 
lost to the <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> 49ers, <DATE>20-17</DATE>, on a last-minute field goal a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
"We expected to play well <TIME>last night</TIME>, and we did not do it," <PERSON>Carson</PERSON> said. "Not 
only did we not do it, we played as badly as we can play." 
</P>
<P>
Carson gambled by starting <PERSON>Mike Pagel</PERSON> at quarterback against the Bills, instead 
of <PERSON>Bernie Kosar</PERSON>. Kosar will start when the Browns play again on <DATE>Nov. 18</DATE> against 
<LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Shofner</PERSON> said. The <PERSON>Browns</PERSON> have a bye this week. 
</P>
<P>
Including playoff games, <PERSON>Carson</PERSON> was 12-14-1 with the <PERSON>Browns</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
Carson, 59, replaced <PERSON>Marty Schottenheimer</PERSON> as the <PERSON>Brown</PERSON> coach on <DATE>Jan. 27, 1989</DATE>, 
after <PERSON>Schottenheimer</PERSON> left in a dispute with <ORGANIZATION>Modell</ORGANIZATION> over coaching styles. 
</P>
<P>
The Browns were 9-6-1 and <ORGANIZATION>AFC Central</ORGANIZATION> champions under <PERSON>Carson</PERSON> last year, making 
it to the <ORGANIZATION>AFC</ORGANIZATION> title game before losing to <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION>. But <DATE>1990</DATE> has been a 
nightmare, with injuries, retirements and holdouts wiping out <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION>'s 
offensive line and fouling up the defense. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't feel Bud was given a fair shake," said safety <PERSON>Felix Wright</PERSON>, who staged 
a bitter holdout before the season. "I'm disappointed. Who knows what would 
have happened if we were all together during training camp, and happy?"

EX-RAM YOUNG IS A CATCH FOR BRONCOS

<P>
Once again, the <ORGANIZATION>Rams</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Raiders</ORGANIZATION> won't be meeting in the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
How about an ex-Raider vs. an ex-Ram? 
</P>
<P>
OK, there's ex-Raider linebacker <PERSON>Matt Millen</PERSON> of the 49ers vs. ex-Ram and 
ex-UCLA Bruin receiver <PERSON>Michael Young</PERSON>, who helped quarterback <PERSON>John Elway</PERSON> and the 
Broncos break up <DATE>Sunday</DATE>'s AFC championship game. 
</P>
<P>
Young, left unprotected by the <ORGANIZATION>Rams</ORGANIZATION> <DATE>last winter</DATE> and signed by the Broncos as a 
Plan B free agent, caught two passes -- one for 70 yards and a touchdown, the 
other for 53, setting up another touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Was he surprised? 
</P>
<P>
"Coming here, I thought that if I made the team, I'd have a chance to 
participate and do some things," <PERSON>Young</PERSON> said. "But never to this extent. I never 
would have dreamed of having a game like this." 
</P>
<P>
Mad at the Rams? 
</P>
<P>
"They just had a change in philosophy," <PERSON>Young</PERSON> said. "There was a new offensive 
coordinator (<PERSON>Ernie Zampese</PERSON>) coming in and I wasn't his type of player. Hey, 
everybody has their opinion. I'm not upset at all at them. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish I could say I had animosity toward 'em but I'd be lying if I said that. 
I almost stayed there because I knew I had a secure job as a backup receiver. 
But I knew that being a backup receiver on the Rams was like being a tackle. I 
mean, I knew I was never going to see any kind of action unless someone got 
hurt. 
</P>
<P>
"I almost didn't leave because I liked it so much. But I tell you what, I like 
it a hell of a lot better here." 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos played the second half without rookie running back <PERSON>Bobby Humphrey</PERSON>, 
and it showed. 
</P>
<P>
Veteran <PERSON>Sammy Winder</PERSON> took over and gained 37 yards -- in 21 carries. 
</P>
<P>
Will <PERSON>Humphrey</PERSON> be ready for the Super Bowl? 
</P>
<P>
Coach <PERSON>Dan Reeves</PERSON> said he has two broken ribs. 
</P>
<P>
"Nah," said <PERSON>Humphrey</PERSON>, who will be X-rayed again today. 
</P>
<P>
Eight different <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION> receivers caught passes, but when asked if <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION>'s 
secondary could have done anything differently to stop them, cornerback <PERSON>Frank 
Minnifield</PERSON> failed to come up with answers. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't pay me to make that evaluation," <PERSON>Minnifield</PERSON> said. "I'm the <ORGANIZATION>CB</ORGANIZATION>, not 
the HC." 
</P>
<P>
HC? 
</P>
<P>
"Head coach." 
</P>
<P>
OK. But what about . . . ? 
</P>
<P>
"Don't even ask me," <PERSON>Minnifield</PERSON> said. "I didn't sit and watch the game. I 
played it. There was no thought process. They just pay me to cover wide 
receivers. You ask me to evaluate something, you ain't doing me no service 
whatsoever." 
</P>
<P>
It was <ORGANIZATION>Minnifield</ORGANIZATION> who slipped and fell, freeing Young for his 70-yard touchdown 
catch. 
</P>
<P>
Bud <PERSON>Carson</PERSON>, despite the loss, was satisfied with his first season coaching the 
Browns. 
</P>
<P>
"When we were down and out, everybody said we were finished," <PERSON>Carson</PERSON> said. "But 
we came back, week by week, every day except today. I'd say we made a hell of a 
run at it." 
</P>
<P>
What did <PERSON>Elway</PERSON> think of the crowd noise that drowned out <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION> counterpart 
<PERSON>Bernie Kosar</PERSON>'s signals? 
</P>
<P>
"I had trouble hearing when we had the ball," <PERSON>Elway</PERSON> said. "I can only imagine 
what it was like for <PERSON>Bernie</PERSON>." 
</P>
<P>
Denver radio station KHOW played a new tune all week, sung to the tune of the 
old Coasters hit, "<PERSON>Charlie Brown</PERSON>." It went: 
</P>
<P>
 <LOCATION>Cleveland Browns</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Cleveland Browns</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
 They're real clowns, those <LOCATION>Cleveland Browns</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
 They're gonna get beat, gonna miss the bus. 
</P>
<P>
 Why the <ORGANIZATION>Denver Broncos</ORGANIZATION> always pickin' on us? 
</P>

Miami Dolphins rookie <PERSON>Pete Stoyanovich</PERSON> may have saved more than a game with his 
35-yard field goal in overtime <DATE>Sunday</DATE> against the <LOCATION>Cleveland Browns</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
He also may have saved his job. 
</P>
<P>
Stoyanovich missed a 46-yard field goal in the third period and a 45-yarder 
with three seconds left in regulation time, but gave the Dolphins a 13-10 
victory when he connected on <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>'s first possession in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a big, big kick in his career," Dolphin Coach <PERSON>Don Shula</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
Stoyanovich, an eighth-round draft choice who became <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>'s kicker when 
veteran <PERSON>Fuad Reveiz</PERSON> was injured in training camp, said he was confident about 
the final kick despite his earlier misses. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't that far out," he said. "I had no doubt I was going to make it. I'm 
just really fortunate that the team gave me a second opportunity to win it for 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland took the kickoff to start overtime and drove 46 yards, but <PERSON>Matt Bahr</PERSON> 
was wide left on a 44-yard field-goal attempt. 
</P>
<P>
"We all miss," <PERSON>Stoyanovich</PERSON> said. "Nobody's perfect." 
</P>
<P>
The winner, with 8:32 left, capped a 55-yard drive that included two 
third-and-10 passes from <PERSON>Dan Marino</PERSON> to <ORGANIZATION>Fred Banks</ORGANIZATION>. On the first pass, <PERSON>Stephen 
Braggs</PERSON> was called for a 26-yard pass interference penalty at the <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION> 47. 
The second pass was a 20-yard completion to the <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION> 27. 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>'s previous home games this season, both losses, also were decided on the 
game's final play. 
</P>
<P>
"There have been two games we should have won at the end, but we didn't," 
<PERSON>Marino</PERSON> said. "This will be a big boost for us." 
</P>
<P>
The Dolphins (2-3) and <PERSON>Browns</PERSON> (3-2) both had a chance to win the game in a wild 
final minute in regulation. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland's <PERSON>Felix Wright</PERSON> returned an interception to the <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> 37 with 1:08 
left, but <PERSON>Louis Oliver</PERSON> intercepted <PERSON>Bernie Kosar</PERSON>'s pass two plays later. Marino 
completed two passes for 23 yards before <PERSON>Stoyanovich</PERSON> missed. 
</P>
<P>
The Browns drove to <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>'s 45-yard line with five minutes to go in the <DATE>fourth 
quarter</DATE>. Two penalties set them back, and safety <PERSON>Jarvis Williams</PERSON> broke up a 
third-down pass at the <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> 30. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't do it when we had to," <ORGANIZATION>Browns Coach Bud Carson</ORGANIZATION> said. "We had our 
shots." 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland was hampered by eight penalties for 86 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"Sloppy, sloppy, sloppy football," <PERSON>Carson</PERSON> said. "Ten points don't win many 
football games."

<TEXT>
<P>
If you're a pro football fan, it's pretty hard to beat today's fare. Not one 
but two championship games. 
</P>
<P>
You're going to be hearing analysis before, during and after both games, and 
the main men are <PERSON>Bill Walsh</PERSON> and <PERSON>John Madden</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Walsh</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION> newcomer, knows a lot about the <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> 49ers, but 
circumstances dictate that he works the AFC game between the <LOCATION>Cleveland Browns</LOCATION> 
and the <LOCATION>Denver Broncos</LOCATION> at Mile High Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION> has <PERSON>Madden</PERSON>, a former AFC coach, on the <ORGANIZATION>NFC</ORGANIZATION> game between the Rams and the 
49ers at <LOCATION>Candlestick Park</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Both commentators were interviewed last week. First, <PERSON>Madden</PERSON>'s views. 
</P>
<P>
Question: Can the <ORGANIZATION>Rams</ORGANIZATION> beat the 49ers? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: The Rams are going to have to come up with their best defensive game of 
the year. If they don't, they're in trouble. Then it becomes a shootout, and 
they're going to have to score a hell of a lot of points. 
</P>
<P>
I mean, the Rams can score a lot of points. They're capable of doing that. But 
I really believe the <ORGANIZATION>Rams</ORGANIZATION>, defensively, are going to have to play above their 
heads. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Might the 49ers, who manhandled <LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION> <DATE>last weekend</DATE>, be a little 
overconfident and maybe a little complacent? 
</P>
<P>
A: If it was anyone but the Rams, they could be. If the <ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION> had won, they 
could be. But they know first hand what the Rams can do. They have too much 
respect for the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
I've been working on my All-Madden team and have talked with some of the 49ers, 
and when I ask what team, besides the 49ers, is the best, every guy says the 
Rams. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Should the <ORGANIZATION>Rams</ORGANIZATION> try to put a lot of pressure on <LOCATION>Joe Montana</LOCATION>? 
</P>
<P>
A: They're going to have to pressure him to stay in the middle, like they did 
(<LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION>'s Randall) <PERSON>Cunningham</PERSON>. I don't think sacks, either way, are going 
to be a big thing in this game. What the <ORGANIZATION>Rams</ORGANIZATION> have to do more than anything 
else is tackle the receivers as soon as they catch the ball. 
</P>
<P>
What they can't do is let <PERSON>Jerry Rice</PERSON> break away for a 70-yard touchdown after 
he catches a short pass, like he did against the Vikings. They can't let <PERSON>John 
Taylor</PERSON> break away like he did against them in that <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> game. The Rams 
look like they're tackling better since that game. 
</P>
<P>
You're not going to shut out Rice and <PERSON>Taylor</PERSON>. But when they do catch the ball, 
you've got to tackle them, put the clamps on 'em. 
</P>
<P>
Q: You grew up with <PERSON>John Robinson</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Daly City</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif</LOCATION>. He has been your 
lifelong friend and he once coached your running backs when you were coaching 
the <ORGANIZATION>Oakland Raiders</ORGANIZATION>. Last week, <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> said, despite his reputation for being 
a running coach, that he has really been a passing coach all along. 
</P>
<P>
A: I don't believe that. I say that respectfully. It's just that I know <PERSON>John</PERSON> as 
well as anybody. He is a running coach. He knows more about runners and running 
backs than any coach in the league, maybe more than anyone who has ever coached 
in this league. 
</P>
<P>
But he's not dumb. He's smart enough to know that with the personnel he now 
has, passing is the way to go. It doesn't take a genius to figure that out, not 
when you have guys like <PERSON>Jim Everett</PERSON> and <PERSON>Flipper Anderson</PERSON> and <PERSON>Henry Ellard</PERSON>. 
They've even been working <PERSON>Ron Brown</PERSON> into the offense. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Looking at it from another point of view, what must the 49ers do to win? 
</P>
<P>
A: I think it's the same for the 49ers as the Rams. The team that tackles the 
best is going to win this game. The 49ers aren't going to get a lot of sacks. 
</P>
<P>
What the 49ers have to do is help <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> get into his rhythm. If he does that, 
the 49ers are going to be hard to beat. 
</P>
<P>
I'm not saying it can't be done. Once the <ORGANIZATION>Rams</ORGANIZATION> beat <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION>, all they had 
to do to get to the Super Bowl was beat two teams they beat during the season, 
the <ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION> and 49ers. And they've already done half of that. 
</P>
<P>
And now from <PERSON>Walsh</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
Q: The last two times <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION> met for the <ORGANIZATION>AFC</ORGANIZATION> championship, the 
Broncos won both times, first on a 15-play, 98-yard drive and then when the 
<PERSON>Browns</PERSON>' <LOCATION>Earnest</LOCATION> Byner fumbled on the three-yard line. Might the Browns be a 
little gun-shy? 
</P>
<P>
A: That's a good point. If they have to measure every step and worry about 
making a mistake, they'll be in trouble. In a game like this, you have to let 
it fly. It's up to (Coach) <LOCATION>Bud Carson</LOCATION> to keep the team loose, and it's up to 
(owner) Art Modell not to put any extra heat on them publicly. 
</P>
<P>
Q: You were a passing coach. What's your opinion of the two quarterbacks in 
this game, <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Bernie Kosar</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>John Elway</PERSON>? 
</P>
<P>
A: They're two of the best quarterbacks in football. Elway is more active. 
<PERSON>Kosar</PERSON> has a quicker release and is more accurate on shorter passes. 
</P>
<P>
Q: And the receivers? 
</P>
<P>
A: Both teams also have a lot of talent in this area. It's really a tossup. 
<PERSON>Webster Slaughter</PERSON>, <PERSON>Reggie Langhorne</PERSON>, <PERSON>Ozzie Newsome</PERSON> and <PERSON>Eric Metcalf</PERSON> coming out 
of the backfield for the <ORGANIZATION>Browns</ORGANIZATION> is a very talented group. 
</P>
<P>
We talked to <PERSON>Elway</PERSON> about his receivers before the <LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION> game. He knows his 
people so well. He said <PERSON>Mark Jackson</PERSON> is the quickest and <PERSON>Vance Johnson</PERSON> is also 
quick, and more dependable. <PERSON>Michael Young</PERSON> has the best hands and runs the best 
routes. He is extremely good. When it's third down and they need the yards, 
Young is the guy <PERSON>Elway</PERSON> likes to go to. They don't use <PERSON>Ricky Nattiel</PERSON> that much, 
but he's good going downfield. And <PERSON>Steve Sewell</PERSON>, like <PERSON>Metcalf</PERSON> for the <LOCATION>Browns</LOCATION>, 
is good coming out of the backfield. 
</P>
<P>
Q: The consensus seems to be the Super Bowl winner will again come from the 
<ORGANIZATION>NFC</ORGANIZATION>. Do you agree? 
</P>
<P>
A: Well, <LOCATION>Cincinnati</LOCATION> came close to the 49ers <DATE>last year</DATE> (the Bengals lost, 
20-16), so that shows anything can happen. But there is no question the <ORGANIZATION>NFC</ORGANIZATION> is 
the stronger, more physical conference.

AFC LOOKS PRETTY GOOD, BUT WILL IT BE SUPER?; 
</P>
<P>
PREVIEW: BENGALS AND OILERS, WITH HIGH-TECH OFFENSES, HAVE BEST CHANCE TO 
OVERCOME SIX SUPER BOWL LOSSES IN A ROW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In each of the past six years, the <ORGANIZATION>American Football Conference</ORGANIZATION> has resembled 
an express train moving smoothly through the countryside toward the end of the 
line, where it spectacularly derails. 
</P>
<P>
AFC teams have played the <ORGANIZATION>NFC</ORGANIZATION> on even terms each season since <DATE>1984</DATE>, winning 
their share of the annual interconference series. Then each time, their 
champions have gotten untracked on the <TIME>last afternoon</TIME>, losing six consecutive 
Super Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody can really explain it," <LOCATION>Cincinnati Bengal</LOCATION> Coach <PERSON>Sam Wyche</PERSON> said the 
other day, reviewing the <ORGANIZATION>AFC</ORGANIZATION>'s record slump. "But I can't see it going on much 
longer." 
</P>
<P>
Wyche's team, in fact, could reverse the momentum. The Bengals and <ORGANIZATION>Houston 
Oilers</ORGANIZATION> seem to be the best in their conference, and one or the other can be 
expected to represent the AFC in Super Bowl XXV, <DATE>Jan. 27</DATE> in <LOCATION>Tampa</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Both are modern offensive teams. The Bengals play football the <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> 
49er way -- with a major new component, <PERSON>Wyche</PERSON>'s no-huddle approach -- and the 
Oilers have converted to the run-and-shoot formation, which makes use of four 
wide receivers at all times. 
</P>
<P>
But they converted only a few weeks ago. The run and shoot is a radical 
departure from conventional football, and the <ORGANIZATION>Oilers</ORGANIZATION> may need a season of 
seasoning. The Bengals don't. 
</P>
<P>
Their time-proven offense took <PERSON>Wyche</PERSON> to the Super Bowl only 18 months ago, and 
that day, <LOCATION>Cincinnati</LOCATION> quarterback <PERSON>Boomer Esiason</PERSON> led <PERSON>Joe Montana</PERSON>'s team until 
the last minute, when <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>, ending a 20-16 rouser, did what he usually does. 
</P>
<P>
This year, <LOCATION>Cincinnati</LOCATION>'s problem is the potency of its own division, the <ORGANIZATION>AFC</ORGANIZATION>'s 
strongest. 
</P>
<P>
The Bengals are looking for big trouble from all three of their <ORGANIZATION>Central 
Division</ORGANIZATION> rivals -- the <ORGANIZATION>Pittsburgh Steelers</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Houston Oilers</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Cleveland 
Browns</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
They also expect trouble from the evenly matched top four in the AFC West: the 
<ORGANIZATION>Raiders</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Kansas City Chiefs</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Denver Broncos</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>San Diego Chargers</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
These are the <ORGANIZATION>AFC</ORGANIZATION>'s big eight -- of whom only five can make the <DATE>1990</DATE> playoffs 
along with an <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> entry, the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> Jets or <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> Bills. 
</P>
<P>
Under a revised playoff system, three wild-card teams from each conference will 
compete with the six division winners, starting <DATE>Jan. 5-6</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Most coaches expect <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION> to be one of the <ORGANIZATION>AFC</ORGANIZATION>'s six. The Broncos are a more 
solid group than they seemed in <LOCATION>Super Bowl XXIV</LOCATION>, where <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> led the 49ers to 
a 55-10 victory. 
</P>
<P>
That was the third of four jolts that <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION> Coach <PERSON>Dan Reeves</PERSON> has taken in the 
past four years. His recent heart attack followed three Super Bowl losses. 
</P>
<P>
"Bouncing back is what life is all about," he said last week. 
</P>
<P>
He's right about that, although this season, it will be either <LOCATION>Cincinnati</LOCATION> or 
<LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The AFC top 10: 
</P>
<P>
1) <LOCATION>CINCINNATI</LOCATION> BENGALS 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback: <ORGANIZATION>Boomer Esiason 
</P>
<P>
Coach</ORGANIZATION>: <PERSON>Sam Wyche</PERSON> (51-47) 
</P>
<P>
The Bengals and 49ers are both led by Bill Walsh-trained coaches, <PERSON>Wyche</PERSON> and 
<PERSON>George Seifert</PERSON>, and their modern offenses are similar. A possibly decisive 
difference is that the 49ers spend heavily for talent. In contrast, one of 
<LOCATION>Cincinnati</LOCATION>'s best two linemen, <PERSON>Max Montoya</PERSON>, went to the Raiders in the kind of 
Plan B exodus that <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> avoids by outbidding everyone else. Nor have 
the Bengals replaced injured back <PERSON>Ickey Woods</PERSON>. They can still win with <PERSON>Wyche</PERSON>'s 
no-huddle offense. 
</P>
<P>
2) <LOCATION>HOUSTON</LOCATION> OILERS 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback: <ORGANIZATION>Warren Moon 
</P>
<P>
Coach</ORGANIZATION>: <PERSON>Jack Pardee</PERSON> (first year) 
</P>
<P>
Their opponents describe this team's talent as the best that ever lined up in 
the run-and-shoot formation, which <ORGANIZATION>Pardee</ORGANIZATION> previously brought to two other 
<LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION> winners: the <ORGANIZATION>United States Football League</ORGANIZATION>'s Gamblers and the <ORGANIZATION>Southwest 
Conference</ORGANIZATION>'s Cougars. The <ORGANIZATION>Oilers</ORGANIZATION>' unsurpassed blocking starts with <PERSON>Bruce 
Matthews</PERSON>, the receiving with <ORGANIZATION>Drew Hill</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Ernest Givins</PERSON>. A defensive 
specialist, <PERSON>Pardee</PERSON> will address the problems on that side. The question is how 
fast they can adjust to a strange new offense. 
</P>
<P>
3) <LOCATION>DENVER</LOCATION> BRONCOS 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback: <PERSON>John Elway</PERSON> 
</P>
<P>
Coach: <PERSON>Dan Reeves</PERSON> (91-55-1) 
</P>
<P>
Their Super Bowl wipeout last winter is still held against the Broncos by the 
same people who seem to forget that in <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>'s three-game playoff parade, the 
49ers rolled over the <LOCATION>Vikings</LOCATION> and Rams the same way. Last year, when the 
<ORGANIZATION>Broncos</ORGANIZATION>' ancient weaknesses evaporated with a new defense and runner, <PERSON>Bobby 
Humphrey</PERSON>, they were 6-0 over the AFC in oxygen-thin Mile High Stadium. Nobody 
in the <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> comes close to matching <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION>'s home-field edge. 
</P>
<P>
4) <LOCATION>PITTSBURGH</LOCATION> STEELERS 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback: Bubby Brister 
</P>
<P>
Coach: <PERSON>Chuck Noll</PERSON> (193-140-1) 
</P>
<P>
Having survived the winning '70s and slumping '80s, <PERSON>Noll</PERSON> hits the '90s with a 
good, young offense and improving defensive personnel. His <ORGANIZATION>Merrill Hoge-Tim 
Worley</ORGANIZATION> backfield became the <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION>'s best last year, and new coordinator <PERSON>Joe 
Walton</PERSON> will help the offense. The two questions: Is Brister an <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> comer? Can 
the defense hold the edge it got last year with coordinator <PERSON>Rod Rust</PERSON>, the new 
coach at <LOCATION>New England</LOCATION>? The defensive standout is cornerback <PERSON>Rod Woodson</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
5) SAN DIEGO CHARGERS 
</P>
<P>
QB: <PERSON>Mark Vlasic</PERSON>, <PERSON>Billy Joe Tolliver</PERSON> 
</P>
<P>
Coach: <PERSON>Dan Henning</PERSON> (6-10) 
</P>
<P>
With either youngster pitching for <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>, the question is whether the 
<LOCATION>Broncos</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Chargers</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Raiders</ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION>Chiefs</ORGANIZATION> will break out of the pack in a year when 
<LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION> has the only established quarterback. At most other positions, <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> 
could be slightly ahead with runner <PERSON>Marion Butts</PERSON>, receiver <PERSON>Anthony Miller</PERSON>, 
linebacker <PERSON>Billy Ray Smith</PERSON> and the depth stored by former General Manager <PERSON>Steve 
Ortmayer</PERSON> and the incumbent, <PERSON>Bobby Beathard</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
6) RAIDERS 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback: <PERSON>Jay Schroeder</PERSON> 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Art Shell (7-5) 
</P>
<P>
See paragraph above for a more exact placing of the <ORGANIZATION>Raiders</ORGANIZATION>, who, in various 
media surveys, have been ranked from first to last in their division -- and who 
have been mentioned by others for both the Super Bowl and the <ORGANIZATION>AFC</ORGANIZATION> cellar. They 
seem clearly stronger defensively and in the offensive line, and they have the 
fastest receivers in football. All they want from <PERSON>Schroeder</PERSON> is occasional 
accuracy on their favorite missile, the long, long pass to one of those 
receivers. 
</P>
<P>
7) <LOCATION>KANSAS CITY</LOCATION> CHIEFS 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback: <PERSON>Steve DeBerg</PERSON> 
</P>
<P>
Coach: <PERSON>Marty Schottenheimer</PERSON> 
</P>
<P>
(8-7-1) 
</P>
<P>
If for once DeBerg could play like <PERSON>Bernie Kosar</PERSON> or <PERSON>Jim Kelly</PERSON>, the Chiefs would 
jump to the head of the class in the <ORGANIZATION>AFC</ORGANIZATION> and even worry the <ORGANIZATION>NFC</ORGANIZATION> in the Super 
Bowl. They're sound enough elsewhere. They have a few receivers and a big 
running back, <PERSON>Christian Okoye</PERSON>, and at linebacker they line up an MVP-type in 
<PERSON>Derrick Thomas</PERSON> who would make any defense look good. When they have all their 
players, their secondary is among the finest. But it's really all up to <ORGANIZATION>DeBerg</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
8) <LOCATION>CLEVELAND</LOCATION> BROWNS 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback: <PERSON>Bernie Kosar</PERSON> 
</P>
<P>
Coach: <ORGANIZATION>Bud Carson</ORGANIZATION> (10-7-1) 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Carson</PERSON> was 58 last year when they finally gave him an <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> team, and he won a 
division title. Then the <PERSON>Browns</PERSON> beat <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> in the playoffs before losing the 
<ORGANIZATION>AFC</ORGANIZATION> title game again in <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION>. Although their quarterback ranks with the <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION>'s 
best, the <PERSON>Browns</PERSON> may otherwise be a touch short in talent. Still, some people 
say they'll win again with running backs <PERSON>Eric Metcalf</PERSON> and <PERSON>Kevin Mack</PERSON>, and with 
<PERSON>Clay Matthews</PERSON> and <PERSON>Michael Dean Perry</PERSON> on defense. 
</P>
<P>
9) <LOCATION>BUFFALO</LOCATION> BILLS 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback: <PERSON>Jim Kelly</PERSON> 
</P>
<P>
Coach: <PERSON>Marv Levy</PERSON> (31-26) 
</P>
<P>
In a slumping division, this team hasn't taken charge as surely as its fans 
thought it would with its intellectual coach, belligerent quarterback, diligent 
general manager, <PERSON>Bill Polian</PERSON>, and its assortment of defensive stars -- <PERSON>Bruce 
Smith</PERSON>, <PERSON>Shane Conlan</PERSON>, <PERSON>Cornelius Bennett</PERSON> and others. They say in <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> that 
<PERSON>Kelly</PERSON>'s talent has been diluted by abrasive relationships with teammates, but 
there's probably nothing wrong with the Bills that more consistency wouldn't 
cure. 
</P>
<P>
10) <LOCATION>NEW YORK</LOCATION> JETS 
</P>
<P>
QB: <PERSON>Ken O'Brien</PERSON>, <PERSON>Tony Eason</PERSON> 
</P>
<P>
Coach: <PERSON>Bruce Coslet</PERSON> (first year) 
</P>
<P>
A new general manager, <PERSON>Dick Steinberg</PERSON>, has brought in a new coach from the <PERSON>Bill 
Walsh</PERSON> school. And although the Jets in a rebuilding year might be over their 
heads in other divisions, they can make a run for it in the <LOCATION>East</LOCATION> if either 
passer is up to it. Some <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> club executives are predicting that in time, 
<PERSON>Steinberg</PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION>AFC</ORGANIZATION>'s other new general managers -- <PERSON>Beathard</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Kansas 
City</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Carl Peterson</PERSON> among them -- will end the <ORGANIZATION>NFC</ORGANIZATION>'s Super Bowl dominance. 
</P>
<P>
THE OTHERS 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
WEST 
</P>
<P>
After <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Raiders</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Kansas City</LOCATION> line up one through four, 
there is only one place left for the <ORGANIZATION>Seattle Seahawks</ORGANIZATION>. It is improbable, 
though, that they'll actually finish fifth. Their coach, <PERSON>Chuck Knox</PERSON>, has a way 
of hanging tough against any odds, and his defense will improve when he gets in 
his first draft pick, flashy lineman <PERSON>Cortez Kennedy</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
In <PERSON>Knox</PERSON>'s offensive backfield, <PERSON>John L. Williams</PERSON> has the look of a run-and-shoot 
triple threat -- runner-receiver-blocker -- which is one reason the Seahawks 
may be in that formation more extensively than they now expect. 
</P>
<P>
Top to bottom, the AFC West has been called a strong division that would be one 
of the <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION>'s strongest if it had more quarterbacks of proven worth. The <PERSON>Elway</PERSON> 
contribution can be measured in one statistic: Of the <ORGANIZATION>AFC</ORGANIZATION>'s 14 teams, the 
<LOCATION>Broncos</LOCATION> alone played in three <DATE>1980s</DATE> Super Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
Many scouts reason that the Chiefs and Chargers are set at most positions and, 
with <PERSON>Carl Peterson</PERSON> and <PERSON>Bobby Beathard</PERSON> rounding up talent, both soon may stand 
with the <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION>'s leaders. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CENTRAL 
</P>
<P>
In this division last year, in one of the <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION>'s closest races of all time, 
<LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION> finished 9-6-1, <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION> 9-7, <LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION> 9-7 and <LOCATION>Cincinnati</LOCATION> 8-8. It 
will come as no surprise to most in the AFC Central if the standings are the 
same this year -- or if they're just the reverse, with the Browns a half-game 
behind the others. 
</P>
<P>
Few <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> teams match the quality of the <LOCATION>Cincinnati</LOCATION> nucleus: blocker <PERSON>Anthony 
Munoz</PERSON>, receiver <PERSON>Eddie Brown</PERSON>, tight end <PERSON>Rodney Holman</PERSON>, runner <PERSON>James Brooks</PERSON>, 
passer <PERSON>Boomer Esiason</PERSON>, nose tackle <PERSON>Tim Krumrie</PERSON> and safety <PERSON>David Fulcher</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland quarterback <PERSON>Bernie Kosar</PERSON> will have a fourth offensive coordinator in 
four years, <PERSON>Jim Shofner</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
The primary AFC Central question is how much <PERSON>Warren Moon</PERSON> will shake things up 
in <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION>'s run and shoot, and the mystery team is <LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION>, which, to many 
AFC critics, seems to be on the way up again. But <LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION>'s Brister is the 
least experienced quarterback in a division with three giants, <PERSON>Moon</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Esiason</ORGANIZATION> 
and <PERSON>Kosar</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
EAST 
</P>
<P>
Some of the <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION>'s most famous winners have come out of the franchises in this 
division -- the Jets with <PERSON>Joe Namath</PERSON>, the Dolphins with <PERSON>Bob Griese</PERSON> and <PERSON>Dan 
Marino</PERSON>, the Colts with <PERSON>John Unitas</PERSON> and <PERSON>Eric Dickerson</PERSON>, the Bills with <PERSON>O.J. 
Simpson</PERSON>, and, most recently, a <LOCATION>New England</LOCATION> Super Bowl team. 
</P>
<P>
But to many in the <LOCATION>AFC East</LOCATION>, their division is in disarray -- although the 
Bills could still come back this year, and the Jets could come up. 
</P>
<P>
In <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Dan Marino</PERSON> keeps asking to be traded. Maybe he's saying something 
more. At 29, he's still the world's best passer. The question is whether Coach 
<PERSON>Don Shula</PERSON>, 60, has enough help besides receiver <PERSON>Mark Clayton</PERSON> and cornerback <PERSON>Tim 
McKyer</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
When the Colts drafted <PERSON>Jeff George</PERSON> last <DATE>spring</DATE>, they disclosed that they had 
the <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION>'s next great quarterback -- but he won't prove it this year. With <PERSON>Eric 
Dickerson</PERSON> out, Coach <PERSON>Ron Meyer</PERSON> has been left with not much but a linebacker, 
<PERSON>Duane Bickett</PERSON>, who can't run the ball or pass it. 
</P>
<P>
The Patriots are stocked with above-average players, none of them at 
quarterback. Though well-coached by rookie <PERSON>Rod Rust</PERSON>, 61, they are unlikely to 
overtake anyone except <LOCATION>Indianapolis</LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
<P>
In light of the chaos caused by the <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> Bills' unexpected no-huddle offense 
last week, <ORGANIZATION>Cleveland Brown Coach Bud Carson</ORGANIZATION> spent the week preparing for more 
of the same today from the <ORGANIZATION>Denver Broncos</ORGANIZATION> in the <ORGANIZATION>AFC</ORGANIZATION> championship game. 
</P>
<P>
"The Bills found a couple weak spots, and they exploited them. We didn't do a 
very good job adjusting to them," <PERSON>Carson</PERSON> said. "They not only used a hurry-up 
game on us, they used an even more effective hurry-up game in that they weren't 
even audibling at the line of scrimmage. They were getting lined up and running 
plays quickly." 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Jim Kelly</PERSON> passed for 405 yards and four touchdowns against <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION> 
and nearly won the game before <PERSON>Clay Matthews</PERSON> intercepted a pass at the goal 
line with three seconds left to preserve the <PERSON>Browns</PERSON>' win. One play earlier, a 
potential touchdown pass glanced off the hands of <PERSON>Ronnie Harmon</PERSON> in the left 
corner of the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
Buffalo's first touchdown came on a no-huddle play that created confusion among 
<LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION>'s defenders. <PERSON>Matthews</PERSON> was feverishly trying to call a timeout as the 
ball was snapped, and <PERSON>Kelly</PERSON> proceeded to hit a wide-open <PERSON>Andre Reed</PERSON> over the 
middle for a 72-yard touchdown play. 
</P>
<P>
Though Denver attempted to use a hurry-up offense without much success in a 
16-13 loss to the Browns in <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION> on <DATE>Oct. 1</DATE>, <PERSON>Carson</PERSON> said he'd be surprised 
if the <PERSON>Broncos</PERSON> didn't try of it today. 
</P>
<P>
"We're anticipating 90,000 no-huddles. Our whole practice has been no-huddles," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
The <PERSON>Browns</PERSON> are seeking their first Super Bowl appearance. The Broncos are after 
their third appearance in four years and fourth overall. They are 0-3. 
</P>
<P>
Denver had a 1,000-yard rusher and a 3,000-yard passer in the same season for 
the first time. Its attack is more balanced than <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION>'s. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>John Elway</PERSON> will supplement the passing game with <PERSON>Bobby Humphrey</PERSON>, who rushed for 
1,151 yards as a rookie and scored eight touchdowns. He is effective inside and 
out. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Elway</PERSON> did not have an outstanding season, but he did pass for 3,051 yards and 
18 touchdowns. He also threw 18 interceptions and was the team's third-leading 
rusher with 244 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland's defensive backs excel at going for the ball -- the <PERSON>Browns</PERSON> led the 
AFC with 27 interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
The only snow fans at the game are likely to see will be capping the mountains 
in the distance. 
</P>
<P>
The forecast for today is mild and breezy, with increasing afternoon clouds and 
high temperatures in the low 50s. 
</P>
<P>
"It's perfect football weather," said weather service meteorologist <PERSON>Joe Baskin</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
"It's cool enough for the players to enjoy it, and enough breeze to blow all 
the smoke out of the stands. Just a really nice day." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Baskin</PERSON> said snow could follow on the heels of the game, however, perhaps on 
<DATE>Monday</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe for the ticker-tape parade," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
If you were from <LOCATION>Struthers</LOCATION>, just outside <LOCATION>Youngstown</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, you didn't take to 
the folks from neighboring <PERSON>Boardman</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
"We're talking the Hatfields and the McCoys here," said <PERSON>Jim Fox</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Boardman 
High School</ORGANIZATION> teacher. "The kids from <ORGANIZATION>Struthers</ORGANIZATION> always had something to prove to 
the rich kids from <PERSON>Boardman</PERSON>." 
</P>
<P>
"<PERSON>Boardman</PERSON> had a better band, better shopping malls, better everything than 
<PERSON>Struthers</PERSON>," said <PERSON>Chuck Perazich</PERSON>, sports editor of the <ORGANIZATION>Youngstown Vindicator</ORGANIZATION>. 
"Except for sports -- when it came to sports, you never knew who was going to 
win. 
</P>
<P>
"In sports it was the cake-eaters from <PERSON>Boardman</PERSON>, against the blue-collar tough 
guys from <ORGANIZATION>Struthers</ORGANIZATION>. Bitter rivals," <PERSON>Perazich</PERSON> said. "That's why I imagine 
(<ORGANIZATION>Chargers</ORGANIZATION>' defensive coordinator) <PERSON>Ronnie Lynn</PERSON> has got to have a funny feeling 
about this game. I got to believe he's going to try a little harder. After all, 
he's from <PERSON>Struthers</PERSON>." 
</P>
<P>
And <PERSON>Bernie Kosar</PERSON> is from <PERSON>Boardman</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
Kosar also is the starting quarterback for the <ORGANIZATION>Cleveland Browns</ORGANIZATION> (1-1), and 
today in front of a sellout crowd of 80,000 he will match brawn and wits with 
<PERSON>Lynn</PERSON>'s not-so-neighborly Charger defense. 
</P>
<P>
"I've known the guy for a long time," <PERSON>Lynn</PERSON> said. "His high school adviser (Fox) 
was my college roommate. I even tried to recruit <PERSON>Bernie</PERSON> to play at <LOCATION>Cal</LOCATION>." 
</P>
<P>
Kosar went on to prosper for the <ORGANIZATION>University of Miami</ORGANIZATION>, but <DATE>today</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>Lynn</ORGANIZATION> will be 
coming after him again. And he won't be alone. 
</P>
<P>
"<PERSON>Bernie</PERSON> knows he's going to get the good pass rush, maybe the great pass rush," 
<LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION> coach <PERSON>Bud Carson</PERSON> said. "Maybe the best in the AFC." 
</P>
<P>
This cannot be good news for <PERSON>Kosar</PERSON>. In two games, he has been sacked 10 times; 
on 10 other occasions, he has released the ball and then has been decked. Four 
of his passes have been deflected by pass rushers. 
</P>
<P>
He wears an elastic wrap around a painted black plastic cup used to protect the 
elbow on his throwing arm, Maybe he should be padded from head to foot. 
</P>
<P>
"He's definitely a tough guy," linebacker <PERSON>Gary Plummer</PERSON> said. "As much as he's 
been knocked around in the last two weeks to still be standing -- you got to 
admire the guy." 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers, however, do not come to <LOCATION>Cleveland Stadium</LOCATION> to praise <PERSON>Kosar</PERSON>. They 
come "to bury him," as defensive tackle <PERSON>Lee Williams</PERSON> pointed out. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the target," <PERSON>Williams</PERSON> said. "We know where he's going to be, and we're 
coming after him. Full throttle." 
</P>
<P>
Protected by an offensive line that doesn't make the Chargers' offensive line 
look so bad anymore, <PERSON>Kosar</PERSON> has struggled to be effective, and as a result, 
<LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION>'s offense ranks 26th in the <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION>. The Browns feature four new starters 
up front, and to hear the folks in <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION>, they'd be just as happy to go to 
war with the four old starters. 
</P>
<P>
It took the <PERSON>Browns</PERSON> seven quarters of play to record their first offensive 
touchdown this season. They now have two. Their longest run from scrimmage has 
been 16 yards by <PERSON>Kevin Mack</PERSON>, who is now sidelined with a broken finger; their 
longest pass play is 27 yards, to <PERSON>Reggie Langhorne</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
"They've had their problems, and they may do some things to keep extra 
protectors in there for <PERSON>Bernie</PERSON>," <PERSON>Lynn</PERSON> said. "But we're going to rush him. 
</P>
<P>
"<PERSON>Bernie</PERSON>'s a courageous guy. But he may throw some away, and if you get hit a 
number of times, I don't care how tough you are, you start to hurt and flinch. 
I can see some of that happening if we do what we're capable of doing." 
</P>
<P>
Now if the <PERSON>Browns</PERSON> are capable of doing what they do best, then nobody scores, 
and these two teams go into overtime for the third time in their last five 
meetings. 
</P>
<P>
Like the Chargers, the <PERSON>Browns</PERSON> try to construct a victory via defense. Their 
head coach is a former defensive coordinator, who was the architect of 
<LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION>'s "Steel Curtain." Their big-play linebacker, <PERSON>Clay Matthews</PERSON>, has 
been to five <LOCATION>Pro Bowls</LOCATION>. Their top pass rusher, <PERSON>Michael Dean Perry</PERSON>, leads the 
AFC in sacks, with four. 
</P>
<P>
In two games, they have yet to surrender a second-half touchdown, and as the 
Chargers are often reminded, they have yet to score in either the third or 
fourth quarters. 
</P>
<P>
"I know. I know," quarterback <PERSON>Billy Joe Tolliver</PERSON> said. "I'm sure they've got to 
feel pretty good about themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"But we're looking to change that. Not necessarily to score in the <DATE>fourth 
quarter</DATE>, but to score if we need to score. That's our goal." 
</P>
<P>
Bring on <PERSON>Fuad Reveiz</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
"Where's the blindfold?" said the Charger kicker, whose job is on the line. 
"Coach (Dan) <PERSON>Henning</PERSON> hasn't made it easy for me putting me on the spot like 
this, but it's something that is part of the business." 
</P>
<P>
Reveiz, one-for-three in field-goal attempts, has been informed that future 
employment with the Chargers rests solely on how he does today. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't be panicking after two games," <PERSON>Reveiz</PERSON> said. "You've got a lot of the 
season to go, and you can't be looking after two games and think it's the end 
of the world." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe not, but an 0-3 start would be the first for the Chargers since going 
0-11 in <DATE>1975</DATE>. It would also put an end to all those high-flying expectations 
that greeted a fifth-place schedule and <PERSON>Bobby Beathard</PERSON>'s arrival. 
</P>
<P>
The last time, however, the Chargers sought victory in the <PERSON>Browns</PERSON>' ramshackle 
backyard, they were waylaid, 47-17. 
</P>
<P>
"We got no allies there," <PERSON>Lynn</PERSON> said. "We're gonna be warming up in front of the 
'Dawg Pound' (the dog bone-tossing section of Browns fans), and they'll be 
throwing things at us and calling us everything but free men. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an avid fan, a rabid fan. This is important to the people in <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION>. 
These are the guys who come out of the mills wearing hard hats who just don't 
take them off <DATE>Friday</DATE> till <DATE>Sunday</DATE>. They live for their football. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean I got a ticket for my college roommate," <PERSON>Lynn</PERSON> said, "and he's rooting 
for <PERSON>Bernie</PERSON>."

<TEXT>
<P>
Just two weeks ago, the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> Jets waived <PERSON>Freeman McNeil</PERSON>, the team's 
all-time leading rusher with 7,146 yards. 
</P>
<P>
When the former <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION> standout went unclaimed by another team, the Jets brought 
<PERSON>McNeil</PERSON> back for his 10th season. 
</P>
<P>
The move paid off <DATE>Sunday</DATE> against the <LOCATION>Cleveland Browns</LOCATION> as <ORGANIZATION>McNeil</ORGANIZATION> rushed for 62 
yards and caught three passes for 80 yards as the Jets beat the Browns, 24-21, 
to give <PERSON>Bruce Coslet</PERSON> his first victory as the team's coach. 
</P>
<P>
"<PERSON>Freeman</PERSON>'s too old," <PERSON>Coslet</PERSON> said with a big smile creasing his face after his 
successful home debut. "He can't do it anymore. You saw that." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>McNeil</PERSON> has been a starter in both of the Jets' games this season because <PERSON>Blair 
Thomas</PERSON> -- the Jets' No. 1 draft pick -- has been slowed by a hamstring injury, 
and <PERSON>Johnny Hector</PERSON> is just approaching peak shape after arthroscopic knee 
surgery. 
</P>
<P>
McNeil and quarterback <PERSON>Ken O'Brien</PERSON> connected on a 59-yard pass play in the 
<DATE>first quarter</DATE> that was the longest of <ORGANIZATION>McNeil</ORGANIZATION>'s career. He ran all the way to 
the one and <PERSON>Brad Baxter</PERSON> got the touchdown two plays later. 
</P>
<P>
The Jets' defense was stingy in the first half and pressured <PERSON>Bernie Kosar</PERSON> 
throughout the game. <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION>, which had only 80 yards rushing last week, was 
limited to 44 against the Jets. 
</P>
<P>
Kosar completed 24 of 41 passes for 233 yards. O'Brien completed 13 of 21 
passes for 218 yards. 
</P>
<P>
The Browns (1-1) got off to a fast start when <PERSON>Eric Metcalf</PERSON> returned the opening 
kickoff 98 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
But the Jets (1-1) came right back with a 68-yard, four-play drive highlighted 
by <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON>' 55-yard run with a screen pass that set up <PERSON>McNeil</PERSON>'s two-yard scoring 
run. 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> went ahead, 14-7, with a 90-yard drive that took just six plays. 
</P>
<P>
Again, <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON> was a key figure with a 25-yard run. On the next play, <PERSON>Anthony 
Blaylock</PERSON> was called for pass interference at the <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION> 27. 
</P>
<P>
Four plays later, Hector scored from the six. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Pat Leahy</PERSON> added a 47-yard field goal after the Jets recovered a Metcalf fumble, 
giving the Jets a 17-7 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"I was very surprised at how they came back after <PERSON>Eric</PERSON>'s touchdown," <ORGANIZATION>Browns 
Coach Bud Carson</ORGANIZATION> said.

BILLS' DISCORD IS MUSIC TO THE EARS OF BROWNS

<P>
All anybody here seems to want to talk about is an anticipated showdown for the 
<ORGANIZATION>AFC</ORGANIZATION> championship next week between the <PERSON>Cleveland Browns</PERSON> and the <PERSON>Denver Broncos</PERSON>, 
who twice in the last three years kept the <PERSON>Browns</PERSON> out of the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Up first for the <LOCATION>Browns</LOCATION>, however, are the embattled <ORGANIZATION>Buffalo Bills</ORGANIZATION>, their 
opponents today in an AFC playoff game at Municipal Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The underdog Bills (9-7) staggered into the postseason, losing three 
consecutive games before closing the season with a 37-0 rout of the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> 
Jets. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback <PERSON>Jim Kelly</PERSON>, whose abrasiveness was tolerated when the Bills were at 
their best, has been criticized by the fans, the media and his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
And in an even more surprising development, <PERSON>Kelly</PERSON> has raised questions about 
his confidence, once thought to be unshakable. 
</P>
<P>
In-fighting among the Bills started in the <DATE>second week of the season</DATE>, when 
<PERSON>Kelly</PERSON> exchanged words with a receiver who was later released, and heated up 
three weeks later, when <PERSON>Kelly</PERSON> suffered a separated left shoulder in a 37-14 
loss to the <LOCATION>Indianapolis Colts</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference the <DATE>next day</DATE>, <PERSON>Kelly</PERSON> blamed the injury on a missed block by 
tackle <PERSON>Howard Ballard</PERSON>. Angering his teammates further, <PERSON>Kelly</PERSON> also said that 
<PERSON>Ballard</PERSON> was the weak link in the Bills' offensive line. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks later, while watching a videotape of a 34-3 victory over the Jets, 
assistant coaches <PERSON>Nick Nicolau</PERSON> and <PERSON>Tom Bresnahan</PERSON> got into a fistfight. Nicolau 
reportedly punched <PERSON>Bresnahan</PERSON>, opening a cut on his chin, and also drove 
<PERSON>Bresnahan</PERSON>'s head through a plasterboard wall, opening a cut on his forehead. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly returned after being sidelined for three games, leading the Bills to a 
24-7 victory over the <LOCATION>Cincinnati Bengals</LOCATION> in Week 12 that established the Bills 
among the elite in the AFC. 
</P>
<P>
All seemed well, or well enough. 
</P>
<P>
But after <PERSON>Kelly</PERSON> played poorly the next week in a 17-16 loss at <LOCATION>Seattle</LOCATION>, running 
back <PERSON>Thurman Thomas</PERSON> told a cable television audience that quarterback was the 
Bills' weak link. 
</P>
<P>
Then, after <PERSON>Kelly</PERSON> saw three of his passes intercepted the next week in a 22-19 
loss to the <LOCATION>New Orleans Saints</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Kelly</PERSON> was asked if his confidence had been 
shaken. 
</P>
<P>
"You might say that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, he was pulled aside for a pep talk by Coach <PERSON>Marv Levy</PERSON>, who had 
always defended <PERSON>Kelly</PERSON>'s brashness, calling it more than mere bravado. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly threw three more interceptions in a 21-10 loss to the <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> 
49ers, but none in the romp over the Jets. 
</P>
<P>
Asked this week about the bickering among the Bills, <PERSON>Levy</PERSON> said: "That's behind 
us, and I'm not talking about it anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the <PERSON>Browns</PERSON> (9-6-1) endured hard times of their own. 
</P>
<P>
Or some did, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback <PERSON>Bernie Kosar</PERSON> has weathered his most trying season, being asked to 
lead an offense that was without <PERSON>Kevin Mack</PERSON>, the <PERSON>Browns</PERSON>' leading rusher in each 
of the previous five seasons, for all but the last four games. 
</P>
<P>
When <PERSON>Kosar</PERSON> was pulled in the <DATE>fourth quarter</DATE> of a 21-0 loss to the Bengals in 
<DATE>Week 13</DATE>, the Browns had scored 37 points in four games. 
</P>
<P>
In a poll conducted the next week by a <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> TV station, only <PERCENT>51%</PERCENT> of the 
record 28,500 respondents said they favored <PERSON>Kosar</PERSON> as the <PERSON>Browns</PERSON>' quarterback 
over his backup, journeyman <PERSON>Mike Pagel</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Kosar</PERSON>, who has led the Browns into the playoffs in each of his five <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> 
seasons, was angered by the lack of support from the fans and also was troubled 
by <ORGANIZATION>Coach Bud Carson</ORGANIZATION>'s refusal to support him publicly. <PERSON>Carson</PERSON> didn't announce 
his starter for the next week's game against the Colts until moments before the 
kickoff. 
</P>
<P>
Carson later claimed he was only trying to keep the Colts guessing and that 
<PERSON>Kosar</PERSON>'s job never was in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the reasoning, <PERSON>Kosar</PERSON> threw for 353 yards against the Colts. But the 
<PERSON>Browns</PERSON> lost, <DATE>23-17</DATE>, when <PERSON>Mike Prior</PERSON> intercepted a pass by <PERSON>Kosar</PERSON> in overtime and 
returned it 58 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Winless in four games, the <LOCATION>Browns</LOCATION> then closed the season with victories over 
the <LOCATION>Minnesota Vikings</LOCATION>, 23-17 in overtime, and the <ORGANIZATION>Houston Oilers</ORGANIZATION>, 24-20. 
</P>
<P>
Mack, jailed for a drug conviction during most of the season, then suffered a 
knee injury. He gained 27 of his 62 yards in the game-winning drive against the 
<ORGANIZATION>Oilers</ORGANIZATION>, scoring on a four-yard run with 39 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Once again, the <PERSON>Browns</PERSON> were AFC Central champions. 
</P>
<P>
Only a more troubled team stands between them and another AFC title game.

Quarterback <PERSON>Bernie Kosar</PERSON> finally turned the tables on the team that has so 
often tormented him, leading <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION> to 10 points in the final 3:21 and a 
30-29 victory over the <LOCATION>Denver Broncos</LOCATION> <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>. 
</P>
<P>
The winning points came on <PERSON>Jerry Kauric</PERSON>'s 30-yard field goal as time expired 
after a 48-yard drive engineered by <PERSON>Kosar</PERSON>. A few minutes earlier, <PERSON>Kosar</PERSON> had 
completed a 24-yard touchdown pass to <PERSON>Brian Brennan</PERSON> that cut a 29-20 deficit to 
29-27. 
</P>
<P>
The <PERSON>Browns</PERSON> had scored only three offensive touchdowns in their four previous 
games. But <PERSON>Kosar</PERSON> completed 24 of 38 passes for 318 yards and three touchdowns 
against the Broncos and could have had a fourth. A five-yard flip to <PERSON>Eric 
Metcalf</PERSON> for a touchdown was ruled a lateral and scored as a rushing touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland (2-3) ended a three-game losing streak that had left <ORGANIZATION>Coach Bud 
Carson</ORGANIZATION>'s job in jeopardy. It came against a team that had beaten the <PERSON>Browns</PERSON> 
three times in the last four <ORGANIZATION>AFC</ORGANIZATION> title games. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't say one game is the season, but if we had lost we would have been so 
far in the cellar we couldn't have dug ourselves out," said cornerback <PERSON>Frank 
Minnifield</PERSON>, who ended his holdout last week and had an interception <DATE>Monday</DATE> 
<TIME>night</TIME>. 
</P>
<P>
"This meant a lot to a lot of people," <PERSON>Kosar</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was almost a 'must' win for us." 
</P>
<P>
Denver (2-3), which suffered five turnovers in a loss to <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> <DATE>last week</DATE>, 
took advantage of two <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION> turnovers to overcome a 20-19 deficit early in 
the <DATE>fourth quarter</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Then came <PERSON>Kosar</PERSON>. He completed a 24-yard pass to <PERSON>Vernon Joines</PERSON> on fourth and two 
from midfield, then threw his third touchdown pass of the game, a 24-yarder to 
<PERSON>Brennan</PERSON> with 3:21 left. 
</P>
<P>
The final drive started with 2:04 left. Kosar completed passes of 15 yards to 
<PERSON>Joines</PERSON>, 20 to <PERSON>Reggie Langhorne</PERSON> and 15 to <PERSON>Brennan</PERSON> on a third-and-eight play to 
set up the winning field goal. 
</P>
<P>
"There's been a lot of heat on the team this year, and to come back in the 
fourth period the way we did is a tribute to a lot of guys," <PERSON>Carson</PERSON> said.

The <ORGANIZATION>Cincinnati Bengals</ORGANIZATION> didn't realize how badly things were going for the 
<LOCATION>Cleveland Browns</LOCATION> until they saw it in person <DATE>Sunday</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
"If you would have told me that we would shut out the Browns, I would have said 
it was impossible," <LOCATION>Cincinnati</LOCATION> receiver <PERSON>Tim McGee</PERSON> said after catching four 
passes, including one on a 38-yard touchdown pass play, as the Bengals blanked 
<LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION>, 21-0. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, <PERSON>McGee</PERSON> hadn't been paying attention to the <PERSON>Browns</PERSON>' offensive problems 
in recent weeks. Their three-game total of 20 points is the lowest for any 
three-game span in franchise history. 
</P>
<P>
<DATE>Sunday</DATE>'s shutout was <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION>'s first at home since <DATE>1977</DATE>, and it came against 
a <LOCATION>Bengal</LOCATION> team that hadn't blanked anyone since <DATE>1980</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
"The defense lately has not been playing up to its potential," <LOCATION>Cincinnati</LOCATION> 
linebacker <PERSON>Reggie Williams</PERSON> said. "This week, we managed to turn it around. We 
got some hits on <PERSON>Bernie Kosar</PERSON> early in the game. When you do that, it can be a 
long day for the quarterback." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Kosar</PERSON> was benched after three quarters, more because of his ineffectiveness 
than his sore right elbow. <PERSON>Kosar</PERSON>, who completed 15 of 30 passes for 130 yards, 
hasn't thrown a touchdown pass in 14 quarters. 
</P>
<P>
"It starts with the quarterback, and I want to take responsibility for the 
football team," said <PERSON>Kosar</PERSON>, who bruised his elbow three weeks ago in <LOCATION>Seattle</LOCATION>. 
"I was disappointed. But I don't play the coach, and that's their decision to 
make. 
</P>
<P>
"There were a couple hits out there and the arm was a little sore, but I don't 
think it was anything of any significance." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Kosar</PERSON>, who was warming his elbow on the sidelines between possessions because 
of the 18-degree temperature and minus-10 wind chill factor, was booed heartily 
by the sellout crowd of 76,236 throughout the <DATE>third quarter</DATE>. The stands were 
nearly empty by late in the <DATE>fourth quarter</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati quarterback <PERSON>Boomer Esiason</PERSON> completed 14 of 32 passes for 197 yards 
with two touchdowns and two interceptions as the Bengals (7-6) put themselves 
back in the <ORGANIZATION>AFC Central Division</ORGANIZATION> race, one game behind <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION> (8-5) and a half 
game behind the Browns (7-5-1). 
</P>
<P>
The victory gave the Bengals their first two-game sweep in the annual "battle 
for Ohio" since <DATE>1984</DATE>. <LOCATION>Cincinnati</LOCATION> beat <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION>, 21-14, <DATE>Sept. 25</DATE> at <LOCATION>Cincinnati</LOCATION>.

4 QUARTERBACKS, 1 SUPER BOWL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEN MURRAY, BALTIMORE EVENING SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is the time of year that can make or break a quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Terry Bradshaw</PERSON> couldn't spell "cat" until he starred in a Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Phil Simms</PERSON> was never good enough in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> until he was perfect in a Super 
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Doug Williams</PERSON> never got the payday he deserved until he broke down barriers in 
a Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
If this is <DATE>January</DATE>, then the <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> spotlight must be on the quarterback. Heading 
into the <ORGANIZATION>AFC</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>NFC</ORGANIZATION> championship games, this year's roll call of Final Four 
quarterbacks is typical of the times. 
</P>
<P>
There's <PERSON>Bernie Kosar</PERSON> and <PERSON>John Elway</PERSON> -- the unorthodox, side-arming flinger 
against the once golden boy -- in <DATE>Sunday</DATE>'s AFC showdown between <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION> and 
<LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
There's <PERSON>Jim Everett</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Joe Montana</LOCATION> -- the new kid on the block against the 
master -- in the <ORGANIZATION>NFC</ORGANIZATION>'s matchup between the <LOCATION>Los Angeles Rams</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> 
49ers. 
</P>
<P>
Somewhere in that group is a Super Bowl winner: if it's <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>, a repeat 
winner, waiting the call of fame and fortune. 
</P>
<P>
Elway and <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> know a little about the territory. Elway is a two-time Super 
Bowl loser with the Broncos, born of expectations that at times have been 
surrealistic. <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> is a three-time winner whose former coach was ready to 
phase him out as recently as <DATE>November 1988</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, of the four, only <PERSON>Everett</PERSON> has not been drummed through the <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION>'s school 
of hard knocks. <PERSON>Kosar</PERSON> was booed this season in <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION>. All he did was win 
four division titles in five years as a pro. Elway was booed in <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION>. All he 
did was win a pair of <ORGANIZATION>AFC</ORGANIZATION> championships. 
</P>
<P>
"There (were) some unpleasant things said and <PERSON>John</PERSON> hasn't had an easy year," 
said <PERSON>Dan Reeves</PERSON>, <PERSON>Elway</PERSON>'s coach in <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION>. "But he has performed well, and he 
showed last week he still is able to do great things." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Elway</PERSON>, 29, became the third player in <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> history to have five straight 
3,000-yard seasons. <PERSON>Dan Marino</PERSON> and <PERSON>Boomer Esiason</PERSON> are the others. Counting <DATE>last 
week</DATE>'s come-from-behind win over <LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION>, he has brought the Broncos back 16 
times with last-minute rallies. It was <PERSON>Elway</PERSON>'s crucial 36-yard completion to 
<PERSON>Vance Johnson</PERSON> on a flea-flicker that set up the <PERSON>Broncos</PERSON>' winning touchdown in a 
24-23 win over the <ORGANIZATION>Pittsburgh Steelers</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
If there's one thing <PERSON>Marty Schottenheimer</PERSON> appreciates in <LOCATION>Elway</LOCATION>, it's his 
competitive fire. 
</P>
<P>
"When you talk about his mobility and strong arm, the one thing people fail to 
recognize is that he probably is as great a competitor as there is," said 
<PERSON>Schottenheimer</PERSON>, head coach in <LOCATION>Kansas City</LOCATION> who lost two <ORGANIZATION>AFC</ORGANIZATION> title games to <PERSON>Elway</PERSON> 
while in <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"I've coached him in the <LOCATION>Pro Bowl</LOCATION>, and I've seen enough of him to know the guy 
is a great competitor. And if you look at all four of these quarterbacks, 
that's one common thread they all have." 
</P>
<P>
Kosar's competitiveness helped him endure a year of insult and injury in 
<LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION>. The <PERSON>Browns</PERSON>' quarterback bruised his right elbow in a Week 10 victory 
over <LOCATION>Seattle</LOCATION>. He played through the pain, and in the next four games the Browns 
went 0-3-1. When he went 20 quarters without a touchdown pass, he was booed at 
home. 
</P>
<P>
"If you ask <PERSON>Bernie</PERSON> how he is, he won't ever say he's hurting," said <PERSON>Bud Carson</PERSON>, 
who replaced <PERSON>Schottenheimer</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION>. "But we've discussed it with the 
doctors and they say he isn't in any career-threatening situation. He just has 
had some different arm problems. 
</P>
<P>
"When the time comes to throw the ball, especially in a big game when we have 
to have it, <PERSON>Bernie</PERSON> comes through. We were much more concerned about him <DATE>last 
week</DATE>, health-wise, than this week." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Kosar</PERSON>, 26, has had elbow, shoulder and finger ailments this year. Last week, 
with various parts of his anatomy hurting, he completed 20 of 29 passes for 235 
yards, three touchdowns and no interceptions. Despite the injuries, <PERSON>Kosar</PERSON> still 
passed for 3,533 yards and 18 touchdowns this season. 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't surprise <PERSON>Schottenheimer</PERSON>. "The thing that stands out is that at a 
point in time when everybody thought he would be at his worst, he got the job 
done," his former coach said. "That speaks volumes about <PERSON>Kosar</PERSON> as a winning 
quarterback." 
</P>
<P>
At a point in time when then-coach <PERSON>Bill Walsh</PERSON> was ready to pass the 49ers' 
quarterbacking torch from <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> to <PERSON>Steve Young</PERSON> last season, <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> responded 
with some of the best football of his life. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers won seven of their last eight games a year ago, and with <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> 
showing the way, capped the season with a dramatic <DATE>20-16</DATE> victory over 
<LOCATION>Cincinnati</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Super Bowl XXIII</LOCATION>. His 92-yard drive at game's end produced the 
winning touchdown, a 10-yard scoring pass to <PERSON>John Taylor</PERSON>. This year, the 49ers 
are 15-2 going into <DATE>Sunday</DATE>'s showdown, and <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> has elevated his game still 
another notch. 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>, 33, completed a staggering <PERCENT>70.2 percent</PERCENT> of his passes this season and 
posted the highest passer rating in <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> history, 112.4. His 
touchdown-to-interception ratio of 26-8 is the best of his 11-year career. 
<LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> was named the <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION>'s MVP for his superior season. 
</P>
<P>
Said first-year 49ers Coach <PERSON>George Seifert</PERSON>, "Any superlative you can use to 
describe him fits." 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>'s next playoff touchdown pass will tie him with <PERSON>Bradshaw</PERSON> for the league 
record of 30. 
</P>
<P>
As fate would have it, there are those who compare young Everett to the veteran 
<LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>. In his second full season as the <ORGANIZATION>Rams</ORGANIZATION>' starting quarterback, <PERSON>Everett</PERSON> 
passed for 4,310 yards and an NFL-high 29 touchdowns. He has a strong arm, 
quick release and soft touch. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a great compliment," <PERSON>Everett</PERSON> said of the comparison. "He (<LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>) has 
proven time and time again he's a Super Bowl winner, and I think that's the 
judgment on quarterbacks. Comparisons are great, but I don't have a Super 
Bowl."

<HL> LEISURE &amp; ARTS -- Sports: Mediocrity's the Word Around NFL </HL>
<AUTHOR> Frederick C. Klein </AUTHOR>
<SO> </SO>
<DATELINE> Denver  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Politics has its Misery Index, which combines unemployment and inflation to gauge how well or poorly off we the people are. 
A similar measure can be applied to the <ORGANIZATION>National Football League</ORGANIZATION>. 
Call it the Mediocrity Index, if you will. 
It measures how many teams are within a game of .500, a workable definition of the common stew. 

   A perusal of the standings at the cessation of hostilities <DATE>Sunday</DATE> revealed 11 of the 28 <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> teams to have been mediocre after 11 weeks, sporting won-lost records of 6-5, 5-5-1, 5-5 or 5-6. 
If that figure holds for the season as a whole, it would be the third highest of this decade, trailing only <DATE>1983</DATE>'s 16 and <DATE>1981</DATE>'s 12. 
That would make it a better than fair-to-middling year for mediocrity. 

   As the winter winds begin to sting the nose, the identity of the mediocre is as interesting as their number. 
The rank includes the defending Super Bowl champion <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> Redskins, who were embearrassed on <DATE>Sunday</DATE> by <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>, 34-14, in their own park, to drop their record to 6-5 and imperil their chances for a repeat. 

   The ever-popular <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> 49ers find unexpected mediocrity gravy on their jerseys as a result of a <DATE>Sunday</DATE> beating by their old neighbors, the <ORGANIZATION>Los Angeles Raiders</ORGANIZATION>. 
Four of the five teams in the <ORGANIZATION>American Conference</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Eastern Division</ORGANIZATION> qualify. 
So do the <LOCATION>Seattle Seahawks</LOCATION>, who haven't been getting their Boz-worth out of their much-injured linebacker, <PERSON>Brian</PERSON>. 

   But whether your MI glass is half full or half empty depends on your perspective. 
The <PERSON>Denver Broncos</PERSON>, party of the second part in the past two <LOCATION>Super Bowls</LOCATION>, were smiling ear-to-ear over their 6-5 record at dusk here <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, while the <LOCATION>Cleveland Browns</LOCATION> were in the dumps over the same numbers. 
That's because the Broncos had just gobbled up a plateful of turnovers to dump the <LOCATION>Browns</LOCATION>, 30-7, and boost their playoff hopes at the <ORGANIZATION>Browns</ORGANIZATION>' expense. 

   The last time these two teams met, the only "m" word anyone was using was "marvelous." 
That was last season's AFC championship game in Mile High Stadium. 
The Broncs won it, 38-33, but not before the <PERSON>Browns</PERSON> had come back from a 21-3 deficit and were an <ORGANIZATION>Earnest Byner</ORGANIZATION> stride from a tying, last-minute touchdown before a fumble thwarted them. 
Given the run of recent Super Bowls, it wouldn't have been a bad idea to end the season right there and decide the league champ by ballot. 
Alas, they played the thing, and <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> beat the Broncs in a 42-10 ho-hummer. 

   Cleveland impressed enough to become a lot of people's pre-season title choice, and to put its tall quarterback, <PERSON>Bernie Kosar</PERSON>, on many a magazine cover. 
Storky <PERSON>Bernie</PERSON>, however, was casualty No. 1 in this year's quarterback injury plague by sustaining a sprained knee in game one, and spent the next six leaning on crutches while his mates relied on stout defense (the best in the conference before <DATE>Sunday</DATE>) to acquire a 4-3 mark. 

   Kosar returned on <DATE>Oct. 23</DATE> and led two victories, causing the <LOCATION>Lake Erie</LOCATION> faithful to joyfully conclude that all was well. 
But the bad-boy <ORGANIZATION>Houston Oilers</ORGANIZATION> whopped the <ORGANIZATION>Browns</ORGANIZATION> country-style a week ago <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>, and the <LOCATION>Broncos</LOCATION> followed suit <DATE>Sunday</DATE>. 

   Not surprisingly, the supposed after-effects of the bruising administered by the Oilers came up frequently in the losers' dressing room here. 
Cleveland coach <PERSON>Marty Schottenheimer</PERSON> declared it had "absolutely nothing" to do with the latest setback, but some of his troops demurred. 
"We could have been a little drawn out from that game," said defensive end <PERSON>Carl Hairston</PERSON>. 
"They hit pretty hard." 

   The situation on the <PERSON>Broncos</PERSON>' side was a bit different. 
This gang had managed to retain a scrappy, underdog image while compiling the <ORGANIZATION>AFC</ORGANIZATION>'s best regular-season record over the 1983-87 campaigns (54-24-1) and winning conference titles the past two years. 
But, perhaps surrendering to angst, they came out flat early this season and lost three of their first four. 

   Three wins perked things up, but the team surrendered 94 points in losses to <LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION> (!) and <LOCATION>Indianapolis</LOCATION>, and had all it could do to edge a <ORGANIZATION>Kansas City Chiefs</ORGANIZATION> team that's so bad it has been denounced on the editorial page of the <ORGANIZATION>Kansas City Times</ORGANIZATION>. (Danders up, the Chiefs beat the 8-2 <LOCATION>Cincinnati Bengals</LOCATION> on <DATE>Sunday</DATE>. 
That's the kind of season it's been.) 

   "I don't know the reasons, but we weren't playing together the first couple months of this season. 
Nothing much was in synch," confirms veteran <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION> guard <PERSON>Keith Bishop</PERSON>. 

   So unpromising was the <PERSON>Broncos</PERSON>' outlook (and so porous their worst-in-the-league defense against the run) that they entered <DATE>Sunday</DATE>'s fray a three-point underdog even though they'd beaten the Browns nine straight times going back to <DATE>1974</DATE>. 
<LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION>'s game plan was to run straight at the <ORGANIZATION>Broncos</ORGANIZATION>' 260-pound defensive linemen, who are teeny weeny by <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> standards. 
Fullback <PERSON>Tim Manoa</PERSON> got the first call. 

   But -- oops! -- Bronco nose tackle <PERSON>Greg Kragen</PERSON> butted the ball from <ORGANIZATION>Manoa</ORGANIZATION>'s hands, defensive back <PERSON>Dennis Smith</PERSON> recovered on the <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION> 22-yard line and, in the course of time, a Rich <PERSON>Karlis</PERSON> field goal gave <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION> a 3-0 lead. 
The Broncos possessed the ball six times in the first half -- four times on <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION> turnovers -- and each time they scored. 
The <PERSON>Browns</PERSON> went oh-for-seven, and took their half-time ease on the short end of a 30-0 count. 

   The second half was pro forma, with the <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION> fans amusing themselves by floating paper airplanes onto the field and the Broncos finding sport in chasing <PERSON>Kosar</PERSON>, who runs like he's on stilts. 
They caught him six times, for 35 yards in losses. 

   As usual, the <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION> offensive star was quarterback <PERSON>John Elway</PERSON>, who flipped, zipped and darted as in days of yore, which is to say last year. 
It was, he said later, "a good win, maybe one we can build on. 
It was nice to have a cushion for a change." 

   In the <PERSON>Browns</PERSON>' boudoir, veteran tight end <PERSON>Ozzie Newsome</PERSON> was saying that, perhaps, adversity would rally his team where high hopes had failed. 
"Maybe we'll circle the wagons, like the cowboys did when the Indians attacked," he said. 
I considered telling him about <PERSON>Custer</PERSON>, but thought better of it.

NFL CLUBS LEAN TOWARD DEFENSIVE SPECIALISTS AS HEAD COACHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG GARBER, The Hartford Courant 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Only a decade ago, defensive coaches in the <ORGANIZATION>National Football League</ORGANIZATION> were a lot 
like <PERSON>Dan Quayle</PERSON> -- fine in their place but not generally considered chief 
executive officer material. 
</P>
<P>
"In <DATE>1979</DATE> we went to (Ray) <PERSON>Perkins</PERSON> as the head coach," <ORGANIZATION>New York Giants General 
Manager George Young</ORGANIZATION> said. "He was an offensive coordinator, one of the golden 
boys. (Bill) <PERSON>Walsh</PERSON>, (Joe) <PERSON>Gibbs</PERSON> and later (Dan) <PERSON>Reeves</PERSON> and (<PERSON>Mike</PERSON>) <PERSON>Ditka</PERSON> were 
the guys people were hiring. At the time, the defensive coaches in the league 
did not think they had a chance of becoming head coach. 
</P>
<P>
The Golden Boy Syndrome, as Young calls it, no longer prevails. Now, the 
league's owners are increasingly turning their teams over to defensive wizards. 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION>'s 28 head coaches are split; 14 are offensive specialists and 14 are 
defensive specialists. But of the six newcomers this season, five have a 
defensive resume. Three teams -- the <LOCATION>Kansas City Chiefs</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Detroit Lions</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>San 
Francisco</LOCATION> 49ers -- made the switch from offense to defense. 
</P>
<P>
Although there are prevailing circumstances surrounding most new hires (for 
instance, <ORGANIZATION>Dallas Cowboys</ORGANIZATION> owner <PERSON>Jerry Jones</PERSON> was the roommate of Coach <PERSON>Jimmy 
Johnson</PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Arkansas</ORGANIZATION>), defense has become fashionable again in 
the fickle <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The laundry list: <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION>; <PERSON>Marty Schottenheimer</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Kansas City</LOCATION>; <PERSON>Wayne 
Fontes</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION>; <PERSON>George Seifert</PERSON>, <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>; <LOCATION>Bud Carson</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Cleveland Browns</LOCATION>; 
<PERSON>Dan Henning</PERSON>, <LOCATION>San Diego Chargers</LOCATION>. Only <PERSON>Henning</PERSON> has extensive experience on 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
"In the <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION>, we copy success and believe in reincarnation," said <PERSON>Ernie Accorsi</PERSON>, 
<LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION>'s executive vice president of football operations. "That's why so 
many of <PERSON>Vince Lombardi</PERSON>'s assistants were hired over the years. That's why 
people are loading up on defense after the (<LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>) Bears and Giants won the 
Super Bowl. It's true with players and it's true with coaches." 
</P>
<P>
Accorsi says he interviewed seven defensive coordinators after <PERSON>Schottenheimer</PERSON> 
was fired over philosophical differences with owner Art <ORGANIZATION>Modell</ORGANIZATION>. With a 
successful quarterback, offensive coordinator and receivers coach already on 
board, <PERSON>Accorsi</PERSON> wanted to maintain offensive continuity. 
</P>
<P>
Most team executives interviewed for this story said that offensive or 
defensive expertise meant less than the character of the individual coach. 
However, most agreed that the bias toward offense that existed early in the 
<DATE>1980s</DATE> has subsided. 
</P>
<P>
"My feeling has never changed," <PERSON>Young</PERSON> said. "You have to run and play defense. 
Sure, there's a trend there, but it comes down to the individual. There were 
some non-football people at the beginning of the decade who thought getting an 
offensive coordinator, a fancy passing game, would solve everything. 
</P>
<P>
"The myth has been exploded. (Don) <LOCATION>Shula</LOCATION>, (Tom) <LOCATION>Landry</LOCATION>, (<PERSON>Chuck</PERSON>) <PERSON>Noll</PERSON>, (Weeb) 
Ewbank ... they all came from defense, but people forgot about it because that 
was a long time ago." 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to open up the game, the <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> liberalized pass-blocking rules in 
<DATE>1977</DATE> and <DATE>1978</DATE>. The immediate result was more points. The long-term effect was a 
new premium on defense. 
</P>
<P>
Overmatched by offenses, defenses were forced to respond. As teams began to 
become more aggressive through blitzing in <DATE>1983</DATE>, defensive touchdowns increased 
sharply as offensive touchdowns began to decline. 
</P>
<P>
Oddly enough, <DATE>1983</DATE> was the year two defensive coordinators were elevated to 
head coaching jobs by their teams, <PERSON>Bill Parcells</PERSON> with the <ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Marion 
Campbell</PERSON> with the <LOCATION>Philadelphia Eagles</LOCATION>. Just after the announcements had been 
made following the <DATE>1982</DATE> season, the two men met at the Senior Bowl in <LOCATION>Mobile</LOCATION>, 
<LOCATION>Ala</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of pressure on us," <PERSON>Campbell</PERSON> told <PERSON>Parcells</PERSON>. "A lot of defensive 
guys are looking to us. If we fail, they'll never get hired." 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately for the <ORGANIZATION>Carsons</ORGANIZATION> and Seiferts of the world, <PERSON>Parcells</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Campbell</ORGANIZATION> 
made generally favorable impressions. At the same time, some of the league's 
defenses began to emerge as dominant. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a finesse label traceable to <PERSON>Walsh</PERSON> and quarterback <PERSON>Joe Montana</PERSON>, the <LOCATION>San 
Francisco</LOCATION> team that capped the <DATE>1984</DATE> season by winning Super Bowl XIX had a 
ruthless defense directed by <PERSON>Seifert</PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION>Chicago Bears of</ORGANIZATION> <DATE>1985</DATE> allowed three 
playoff opponents a ridiculous total of 10 points on the way to victory in 
Super Bowl XX. The <ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION>' savage defense was a chief factor in a 17-2 season, 
including a victory in Super Bowl XXI. 
</P>
<P>
And so, owners were not afraid to give defensive coaches a chance. <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> 
defensive coordinator Buddy Ryan accepted the <ORGANIZATION>Eagles</ORGANIZATION>' head coaching job <DATE>Jan</DATE>. 
<DATE>29, 1986</DATE>, three days after his defense shredded the <ORGANIZATION>New England Patriots</ORGANIZATION> in the 
ultimate game. He has prospered in <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> and last season gave the <LOCATION>Eagles</LOCATION> 
their first division title in eight years. 
</P>
<P>
Following that <DATE>1986</DATE> season, the <ORGANIZATION>Houston Oilers</ORGANIZATION> promoted defensive coordinator 
<PERSON>Jerry Glanville</PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION>New Orleans Saints</ORGANIZATION> hired <PERSON>Jim Mora</PERSON>, a successful <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> 
Football League coach who once served as the Patriots' defensive coordinator. 
Gene <PERSON>Stallings</PERSON>, <PERSON>Landry</PERSON>'s defensive backs coach for 14 seasons in <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION>, was 
the choice of the <ORGANIZATION>St. Louis Cardinals</ORGANIZATION>. Glanville and <PERSON>Mora</PERSON>, who have led their 
teams to the playoffs, are considered saviors in their respective areas. 
</P>
<P>
This past off-season brought more turnover than usual at the top of <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> teams. 
<PERSON>Walsh</PERSON> and <PERSON>Landry</PERSON> retired, and <PERSON>Schottenheimer</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Kansas City</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Frank Gansz</PERSON>, 
<LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Darryl Rogers</PERSON> and <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Al Saunders</PERSON> were all fired. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't hire <PERSON>Marty</PERSON> just because he was a defensive coach," said <PERSON>Carl 
Peterson</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Kansas City</LOCATION>'s general manager and chief operating officer. "But you 
win with defense. It's logic. If you can build a good defense, you always have 
a chance to win. I've always believed that. That's why I hired <PERSON>Jim Mora</PERSON> for the 
(<LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION>) Stars (of the USFL)." 
</P>
<P>
Carson, the creative defensive coordinator of the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> Jets, was the first 
choice of the Browns. Accorsi was impressed with <PERSON>Carson</PERSON>'s knowledge of offense. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been defensing offenses for years," <PERSON>Accorsi</PERSON> said. "He knows which 
offensive schemes give him the most trouble and how to deal with them. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole idea that an offensive guy is that different from a defensive guy is 
the most overblown, ridiculous theory. People think they're different sports. 
Look at <LOCATION>Shula</LOCATION> and Landry ... they were defensive guys and they were still 
calling the plays on the sidelines." 
</P>
<P>
Carson devotes <PERCENT>100 percent</PERCENT> of his time to defense, something evident in 
<LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION>'s 51-0 bombing of the <ORGANIZATION>Pittsburgh Steelers</ORGANIZATION> in last week's opener. He 
is content to let <PERSON>Marc Trestman</PERSON>, who tutored starter <PERSON>Bernie Kosar</PERSON> as well as 
<PERSON>Jim Kelly</PERSON> and <PERSON>Vinny Testaverde</PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Miami</ORGANIZATION>, run the offense. 
</P>
<P>
Fontes was the defensive coordinator under <PERSON>John McKay</PERSON> at <LOCATION>Tampa Bay</LOCATION>, but when he 
was passed over in favor of <PERSON>Leeman Bennett</PERSON> on <PERSON>McKay</PERSON>'s retirement, he joined the 
Lions in <DATE>1985</DATE>. When <PERSON>Rogers</PERSON> was fired with five games left <DATE>last season</DATE>, <PERSON>Fontes</PERSON> 
was named interim coach. He was retained by owner <PERSON>William Clay Ford</PERSON> because he 
won as many games as <PERSON>Rogers</PERSON> (two) in six fewer tries. 
</P>
<P>
One of <PERSON>Fontes</PERSON>' first acts was hiring <PERSON>Mouse Davis</PERSON>, creator of the run-and-shoot 
offense, as his offensive coordinator. Although it is too early to call, 
<LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION> is more likely to win games with its young defense this year. 
</P>
<P>
Ten years ago, <PERSON>Fontes</PERSON> might never have gotten the chance. 
</P>
<P>
"Saying that defensive guys can't be head coaches is like saying men make 
better engineers than women," <PERSON>Young</PERSON> said. "It's only because you see more men 
as engineers. Now that more women are in the field that mold has been broken. 
That's what's happening with defensive coaches in the <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION>."

   ABC television will try to soothe bruised
feelings in <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION> stemming from a joke in a promotion for the
situation comedy ``Coach,'' the mayor's office says.
   <PERSON>Robert A. Iger</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>ABC Entertainment</ORGANIZATION>, promised to air
an apology the night of <DATE>Oct. 22</DATE>, when <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION> broadcasts the <ORGANIZATION>Cleveland
Browns</ORGANIZATION>' home game against the <LOCATION>Cincinnati Bengals</LOCATION>, a statement by
Mayor <PERSON>Michael R. White</PERSON>'s office said <DATE>Saturday</DATE>.
   When the Browns played in <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION> against the <LOCATION>Broncos</LOCATION> on <DATE>Oct. 8</DATE>,
the network broadcast a brief promotion for ``Coach.''
   Actor <PERSON>Jerry Van Dyke</PERSON>, who plays an assistant college football
coach on the series, commented that even if the <PERSON>Browns</PERSON> beat <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION>,
they would still lose ``because they have to go back to
<LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION>.''
   White sent a letter to <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION>, calling the remark insensitive and
disrespectful to the city.
   ``Any comedian or comedy show that uses <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION> as the punch
line for a joke has never visited our city and is relying on what
has been for years the crutch of feeble comedians,'' <PERSON>White</PERSON> said in
his letter to <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION>.
   Iger's letter explained that <PERSON>Van Dyke</PERSON>'s joke was done ``in
character'' and that no malice was intended. Iger noted that two
weeks earlier, during a <ORGANIZATION>Monday Night Football</ORGANIZATION> broadcast, Van Dyke
made the same comment about <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>
   ``We firmly believe this incident should be kept in the proper
perspective, and given the problems existing in the world today, we
urge you and the citizens of your fine city to take this in the
lighthearted spirit in which it was meant,'' <PERSON>Iger</PERSON> wrote.

<HL> LEISURE &amp; ARTS -- On Sports:
Bernie and the Brown in the Pink

<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO>
<DATELINE> Cleveland  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The <ORGANIZATION>Federal Communication Commission</ORGANIZATION> well might consider taking legal action against the <LOCATION>Cleveland Browns</LOCATION> for misleading labeling. 
A team named the <PERSON>Browns</PERSON> has no business playing exciting football. 
The Cleveland Magentas or Aquamarines, maybe. 
But never the <LOCATION>Browns</LOCATION>. 

   No team named the <PERSON>Browns</PERSON>, for instance, should be able to rally from a 20-10 deficit with just over four minutes left to win a double-overtime, 23-20, victory, but that's what the Clevelanders did against the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> Jets here <DATE>Saturday</DATE> in an <ORGANIZATION>American Football Conference</ORGANIZATION> semifinal that had more climaxes than a <PERSON>Jackie Collins</PERSON> novel. 
Even some of the winners expressed surprise at the outcome. 

   "When we were down near the end, <PERSON>Bernie Kosar</PERSON> {the <PERSON>Browns</PERSON>' quarterback} told us not to worry, that we still had time to get it done," said <PERSON>Cody Risien</PERSON>, a veteran offensive tackle. 
"My heart said 'Yeah,' but my mind found it hard to believe." 

   So, too, did the 23-year-old <PERSON>Kosar</PERSON>, in his mind of minds. 
"Things looked bleak," he admitted in a post-game interview. 
Then again, "this team has character, and if there's a way to win, I knew we'd find it," said he. 

   Thus, the <PERSON>Browns</PERSON> will find themselves in the AFC final here <DATE>Sunday</DATE> against the winner of yesterday's late-afternoon Denver-New <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> game. 
That's the furthest they've gone in the <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> post-season tournament since <DATE>1969</DATE>. 
They have had five other shots at playoff glory since then, but all have come up ashes. 
The one that hurt most came six years ago minus a day when, trailing <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION> 14-12 in below-zero weather here, their drive for a winning score was thwarted within hand-shaking distance of the goal line by an interception of a poorly advised pass by quarterback <PERSON>Brian Sipe</PERSON>. 

   The shade of that defeat haunted ramshackle Municipal Stadium on <DATE>Saturday</DATE>. 
"No Red-Right-88" read a fan's sign in footballese reference to that ill-fated play. 
And -- hey! -- it was "deja vu" time in the <DATE>fourth quarter</DATE>, when, with his team at the Jets' two-yard line and trailing 13-10, <PERSON>Kosar</PERSON> flipped a little pass into the waiting arms of Jet cornerback <PERSON>Russell Carter</PERSON>. 

   This, however, is <DATE>1987</DATE>, not '81, and the 6-foot-5 <PERSON>Kosar</PERSON> isn't the shortish <PERSON>Sipe</PERSON>. 
Bernie, you might recall, was the <PERSON>Vinny Testaverde</PERSON> of <DATE>1984</DATE>, leading the <ORGANIZATION>University of Miami</ORGANIZATION> team to national recognition. 
In fact, if it wasn't for <PERSON>Kosar</PERSON>'s leaving the sheltering palms for the pros two years before his college eligibility ran out (he actually graduated early), <PERSON>Vinny</PERSON> might never have had his chance to shine. 

   Kosar is an <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> boy who wanted to play for the <PERSON>Browns</PERSON>, and the team was so flattered it traded about everything but its yard-line markers to <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> for his draft rights. 
Last season was his first, and the team protected his tender psyche with a heavily run-oriented attack. 

   Kosar appreciates offensive balance ("I don't want to throw 50 times a game," he told his coaches), but the scanty rookie employment of his arm chafed. 
This season he has been allowed to throw more, and the <PERSON>Browns</PERSON> have prospered. 
Their 12-4 won-lost record in the regular campaign compares to 8-8 last season, and gives them the home-field advantage throughout the <ORGANIZATION>AFC</ORGANIZATION> playoffs. 

   On <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, however, <PERSON>Brown</PERSON> balance went out the window in the direction of the pass. 
Thwarted by the Jets' sturdy rushing defense until the overtime periods, <PERSON>Kosar</PERSON> set team records for passing attempts (64) and yards (489), and tied one for completions (33). 
In one <DATE>third-quarter</DATE> stretch, the <PERSON>Browns</PERSON> attempted to pass on 16 consecutive offensive plays, not including kicks. 

   Such one-sidedness bodes ill for the team's outlook in the games ahead, as <PERSON>Kosar</PERSON> well knows. 
"We did what worked today, but we wouldn't like to make a habit" of all that passing, he allowed. 

   The <PERSON>Browns</PERSON> also wouldn't like to make a habit of squandering scoring chances the way they did during this strange afternoon. 
They visited Jets' territory on 13 of their 18 ball possessions, but were able to score just five times, on two touchdowns and three field goals. 

   That was partly the fault of placekicker <PERSON>Mark Moseley</PERSON>, who missed on three of his six field-goal tries. 
One of those misses -- from just 23 yards in the first overtime -- provoked a moan from the 78,000 Brownie faithful that could have caused a seiche on <LOCATION>Lake Erie</LOCATION>. 
But the old-fashioned toe-firster got the winner, a 27-yarder, two minutes into OT II. 

   The real drama of the game came in the last period of regulation, though. 
The gutsy, opportunistic Jets went into the quarter ahead 13-10, and made it 20-10 with 4:14 remaining on a 25-yard run by <PERSON>Freeman McNeil</PERSON> on their first play from scrimmage after their second interception of a <PERSON>Kosar</PERSON> pass. 
Things looked browner yet for the Browns after a couple of penalties put them in a second-and-24 situation from their own 18. 

   A questionable roughing-the-passer penalty on Jets lineman <PERSON>Mark Gastineau</PERSON> got them out of that hole, however, and starting on third-and-10 from his own 33 <PERSON>Kosar</PERSON> completed six straight passes for a touchdown with 1:57 left. 
The Browns stopped the Jets on downs and took over again at their 33 with 51 seconds and no timeouts left. 
A pass interference penalty advanced the ball 25 yards and <PERSON>Kosar</PERSON> hit <PERSON>Webster Slaughter</PERSON> for 37 more to the 5. 
<PERSON>Moseley</PERSON>'s 22-yard field goal tied it at 20 with 11 seconds to go. 

   In the overtime, the <PERSON>Browns</PERSON> did what they couldn't do before, which is run the ball. 
Forty five of their 75 yards rushing for the day came on their winning drive. 
"We kept dialing the same number 'til someone answered," said weary lineman Risien. 

   The day, however, was <PERSON>Kosar</PERSON>'s, and everyone knew it. 
"BERNIE 1:25:87" read a balcony sign. 
That's the date of Super Bowl XXI (1/25/87), not one of those ubiquitous biblical citations. 
But if <PERSON>Bernie</PERSON> gets the Browns to <LOCATION>Pasadena</LOCATION>, he'll be Saint Bernard hereabouts.

<P>
<PERSON>Nick Lowery</PERSON> rarely misses, but he doesn't often kick on the sloppy turf in 
<LOCATION>Cleveland Stadium</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Lowery, one of the most accurate kickers in history, missed two long field 
goals in the final four seconds of regulation and another with three seconds 
left in overtime <DATE>Sunday</DATE> as the <LOCATION>Kansas City Chiefs</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Cleveland Browns</LOCATION> 
played to a 10-10 tie. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a tough stadium to kick in," <PERSON>Lowery</PERSON> said. "The last kick in overtime 
was like trying to kick out of a sand trap." 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>Cleveland Stadium</LOCATION> has a grass field that take nearly a year-round beating from 
football and baseball, so the footing is rarely good. 
</P>
<P>
Any moisture makes it a mess. 
</P>
<P>
"It's sandy in places and muddy in other places," said <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Matt Bahr</PERSON>, 
who made a 40-yarder in the first half. "You've even got turf seams. You never 
know what you're going to get when you go out there. Other kickers have empathy 
for me, that I have to kick on this field all the time." 
</P>
<P>
Lowery, who began the year as the <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION>'s second-most accurate kicker behind <LOCATION>New 
Orleans</LOCATION>' <PERSON>Morten Andersen</PERSON>, tied the game with a line-drive, 41-yard field goal 
with 3:48 left in regulation time. 
</P>
<P>
He was wide right on a 45-yarder with four seconds left in regulation, but an 
offside call against <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION> (7-3-1) gave him a second chance from 39 yards. 
That one was wide left. 
</P>
<P>
Lowery's 47-yard try with three seconds left in overtime was short. 
</P>
<P>
The game lived up to its billing as a grudge match between the <PERSON>Browns</PERSON> and their 
former coach, <PERSON>Marty Schottenheimer</PERSON>, head coach of the Chiefs (4-6-1). 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland put <LOCATION>Kansas City</LOCATION> quarterback <PERSON>Steve Pelluer</PERSON> out of the game with a 
sprained knee in the <DATE>first quarter</DATE>. The <PERSON>Browns</PERSON> held <PERSON>Christian Okoye</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION>'s 
leading rusher, to 40 yards in 21 carries. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Eric Metcalf</PERSON> scored on a one-yard run to give <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION> a 10-7 lead in the 
<DATE>third quarter</DATE> after Chiefs scored on the <DATE>second play of the second half</DATE> when 
<PERSON>Neil Smith</PERSON> ran <PERSON>Mike Oliphant</PERSON>'s fumble three yards to score.

BROWNS SHOW DITKA THE FLIP SIDE, 27-7

<P>
Now <PERSON>Mike Ditka</PERSON> knows how the other half lives. 
</P>
<P>
Make that the other <PERCENT>99%</PERCENT>. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time in <LOCATION>Ditka</LOCATION>'s seven years as head coach, the <ORGANIZATION>Chicago Bears</ORGANIZATION> are 
on a three-game losing streak, courtesy of a 27-7 drubbing administered <DATE>Monday</DATE> 
night by the <ORGANIZATION>Cleveland Browns</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like a day of reckoning -- not a day of atonement, but a day of 
reckoning." <PERSON>Ditka</PERSON> said after <PERSON>Bernie Kosar</PERSON> completed 22 of 29 passes for 281 
yards, including a 97-yard touchdown pass to <PERSON>Webster Slaughter</PERSON> and a three-yard 
toss to <PERSON>Eric Metcalf</PERSON>, who also ran seven yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
It's the first such streak for the injury-ravaged Bears, who started four 
rookies on defense, since <DATE>Nov. 15-26, 1981</DATE>, the year before <PERSON>Ditka</PERSON> took over and 
turned the team into one of the <ORGANIZATION>National Football League</ORGANIZATION>'s most dominant teams. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, their 4-3 record drops them a game behind <LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION> in the <ORGANIZATION>NFC Central 
Division</ORGANIZATION>, the first time they've been out of first place in the division since 
the final game of the <DATE>1983</DATE> season -- 85 games ago. 
</P>
<P>
But unlike last week, when he exploded after a loss to <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION> and suggested 
the Bears might not win again, he was more optimistic, praising his defense, 
which has allowed 102 points the past three weeks after surrendering just 61 in 
the opening four wins. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe in them and I believe we can turn it around," said <PERSON>Ditka</PERSON>, whose team 
plays the Rams at home next week in a game that could have huge playoff 
ramifications for a team that's made the playoffs the last five years. "I'm 
more encouraged today than I have been the <DATE>last two weeks</DATE>." 
</P>
<P>
They also have respect. 
</P>
<P>
"When you beat a team like <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> on a <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>, that's something," said 
<PERSON>Michael Dean Perry</PERSON>, who led the defensive effort for the <PERSON>Browns</PERSON>, who broke 
their own two-game losing streak and moved into a three-way tie at 4-3 with 
<LOCATION>Cincinnati</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION> in the <ORGANIZATION>AFC Central</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Perry, whose brother, <LOCATION>William</LOCATION>, plays for the Bears, led a defense that knocked 
<PERSON>Mike Tomczak</PERSON> from the game late in the <DATE>third quarter</DATE> after he went four of 14 
for 76 yards. They also stopped the Bears on <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION>'s two-yard line midway 
through the <DATE>third quarter</DATE>. One play later, <PERSON>Kosar</PERSON> hit Slaughter on the 97-yard 
scoring pass play that was the longest play from scrimmage in <LOCATION>Brown</LOCATION> history. 
</P>
<P>
The call was made by offensive coordinator <PERSON>Marc Trestman</PERSON>, who was under fire in 
the past two weeks as the Browns scored just 17 points in two defeats. And it 
redeemed <PERSON>Kosar</PERSON>, who last week had four passes intercepted in a 17-7 loss to 
<LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Slaughter had eight catches for 186 yards. 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>'s only touchdown came on a five-yard pass from <PERSON>Jim Harbaugh</PERSON> to <PERSON>Wendell 
Davis</PERSON> with 3:47 left.

REEVES BLASTS TAGLIABUE FOR A 'ROOKIE' MISTAKE

<TEXT>
<P>
Coach <PERSON>Dan Reeves</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Denver Broncos</ORGANIZATION> criticized a decision by the <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> to 
allow the <LOCATION>Cleveland Browns</LOCATION> to arrive in <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION> later than usual for <DATE>Sunday</DATE>'s 
<ORGANIZATION>AFC</ORGANIZATION> championship game. 
</P>
<P>
"They took advantage of a rookie commissioner (<PERSON>Paul Tagliabue</PERSON>)," <PERSON>Reeves</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
League rules require visiting teams to arrive at least 48 hours before a 
championship game, but the <PERSON>Browns</PERSON> sought and were granted a waiver from 
<PERSON>Tagliabue</PERSON> allowing them to arrive on <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, 24 hours before the game. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland team physicians believe the Browns will be less bothered by <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION>'s 
mile-high altitude if they arrive only 24 hours before game time. 
</P>
<P>
"When we went to <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION> <DATE>three years ago</DATE>, we had to get in there two days 
early," <PERSON>Reeves</PERSON> said. "Part of the reason was media accessibility, even though 
the only Broncos at a <DATE>Friday</DATE> press conference were me and one player. 
</P>
<P>
"Traveling on <DATE>Friday</DATE> is definitely disruptive. It's a disadvantage. You 
practice at home before you leave. You have to meet at your hotel on <DATE>Saturday</DATE>. 
In <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION>, our players couldn't sleep at night because their fans kept 
driving around our hotel, honking their horns. "It's disruptive having to go on 
the road, but that's the way it's supposed to be. That's why you play for the 
home-field advantage. I agree that the rule is antiquated. But to all of a 
sudden have it changed the week before the game is a mistake, in my opinion. I 
don't agree with the decision." 
</P>
<P>
Reeves continued to needle the <PERSON>Browns</PERSON> over their apparent preoccupation with 
<LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION>'s thin air. 
</P>
<P>
"The altitude is going to be a factor whether they come in here 45 minutes 
before the game or 45 days before the game," he said. "They went to <LOCATION>Albuquerque</LOCATION> 
for a whole week one year. Another time they came here the day before. It 
doesn't matter. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of our crowd and the altitude, I think most people around the league 
would agree that we have the biggest home-field advantage of any team. The thin 
air does have an effect. Our record at home proves that." 
</P>
<P>
Hoping to muzzle any ideas fans might have about starting up a <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION> "dawg 
pound," officials say they plan to clamp down on rowdy people who throw objects 
during <DATE>Sunday</DATE>'s game. 
</P>
<P>
Fans caught tossing items on the field at <ORGANIZATION>Mile High Stadium</ORGANIZATION> during the <ORGANIZATION>AFC</ORGANIZATION> 
championship game will be arrested, and could lose rights to season tickets, 
officials say. In addition, security will be beefed up. 
</P>
<P>
During an <DATE>Oct. 1</DATE> game in <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION> when the <PERSON>Browns</PERSON> defeated the Broncos, 16-13, 
fans pelted players and officials with dog biscuits, eggs and even radio 
batteries. 
</P>
<P>
Referee <PERSON>Tom Dooley</PERSON> had the Broncos switch ends of the field during the game to 
avoid the "Dawg Pound," after he was hit on the head with an AA battery. The 
"Dawg Pound" is the nickname given to the east end of the <PERSON>Browns</PERSON>' stadium where 
the rowdiest fans sit. 
</P>
<P>
Coach <PERSON>Bud Carson</PERSON> dreams of having his <ORGANIZATION>Cleveland Browns</ORGANIZATION> run through the <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION> 
defense the way the <ORGANIZATION>Pittsburgh Steelers</ORGANIZATION> did for half a game <DATE>last Sunday</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
But he says it won't happen. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't duplicate <LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION>'s running game," <PERSON>Carson</PERSON> said. "There are a few 
things that they do that we also do with our running game, but we don't do them 
as well. We're a different team than they are."

<PERSON>Ozzie Newsome</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION>'s all-time reception leader among tight ends, said <DATE>today</DATE> 
that he will return for one more season with the <ORGANIZATION>Cleveland Browns</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>Newsome</PERSON>, who 
has been the subject of retirement speculation for several years, said he had 
decided to leave the game after last season but changed his mind after an 
overhaul of the <PERSON>Browns</PERSON>' coaching staff. 
</P>
<P>
Coach <PERSON>Marty Schottenheimer</PERSON> quit the Browns at the end of the season over 
philosophical differences with owner <PERSON>Art Modell</PERSON>, and most of <PERSON>Schottenheimer</PERSON>'s 
assistants also left. Newsome decided to wait until a new head coach, <PERSON>Bud 
Carson</PERSON>, was chosen, and the veteran tight end then had a long talk with <PERSON>Marc 
Trestman</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION>'s quarterback coach last season, who has been elevated to 
offensive coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
During his career, <PERSON>Newsome</PERSON> has had 610 receptions for 7,416 yards and 44 
touchdowns. He hasn't fumbled in his last 505 receptions and has caught at 
least 30 passes in each of his 11 seasons. <PERSON>Newsome</PERSON>, who celebrates his 33rd 
birthday <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, had 35 catches for 343 yards last season and extended his 
consecutive game reception streak to 143 games.

<HL> LEISURE &amp; ARTS -- On Sports: A Super Semi at Mile High Stadium </HL>
<AUTHOR> Frederick C. Klein </AUTHOR>

<DATELINE> Denver  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This is a democracy, where the majority rules, so what say we take a vote about ending the <ORGANIZATION>National Football League</ORGANIZATION> season now, sans Super Bowl? 

   All in favor of awarding the championship to the <LOCATION>Washington Redskins</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>National Conference</ORGANIZATION> titlists, raise your hands. 
Let's see, <PERSON>Jack Kent Cooke</PERSON> is one, <PERSON>Joe Gibbs</PERSON> is two, and those two dozen folks wearing pig snouts make it 26. 
Anyone else? 
OK. 

   Now everybody for the <ORGANIZATION>Denver Broncos</ORGANIZATION>. 
Oooh, better not get impatient, because this count is gonna take awhile. 
Two hundred twenty million and one; 220,000,002; 220,000,003 . . . my calculator just gave out. 
No matter, though. 
I think it's safe to say that the Broncs squeaked through. 

   The Denverites are the people's cherce because here on <DATE>Sunday</DATE> in the SB semieye, a.k.a. the <ORGANIZATION>American Conference</ORGANIZATION> final, they helped give us the kind of game we always want from a Super Bowl, but never get. 
They and the <LOCATION>Cleveland Browns</LOCATION>, who are growing accustomed to being the party of the second part in these gridiron affairs of the palpitating heart, posted 71 points in Mile High Stadium. 
The Broncos got 38 of 'em to win. 

   It wasn't so much how many points were scored as how. 
Denver quarterback <PERSON>John Elway</PERSON> passed, ran and even punted in as good an impersonation of <PERSON>Frank Merriwell</PERSON> as you'll see in these specialized times, and <PERSON>Bernie Kosar</PERSON>, his <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION> counterpart, almost bested him in his own tall, cool fashion. 

   The Brownies trailed by 18 points as late as the <DATE>third quarter</DATE>, but came within a swipe of sending the game into overtime. 
Down 38-31, <PERSON>Kosar</PERSON> moved his team 67 yards to the <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION> eight with 1:12 left in a drive reminiscent of the Elway-engineered one that set up the Broncos for an overtime win in this same event last year in <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION>. 
The <PERSON>Browns</PERSON>' bowling-ball running back, <LOCATION>Earnest Byner</LOCATION>, then swept left to within a tantalizing stride of the end zone, only to have Bronco reserve cornerback <PERSON>Jeremiah Castille</PERSON> knock the ball from his grasp and <DATE>fall</DATE> on it at the three. 
Denver ran out the clock from there, contributing a harmless safety to the <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION> point cache. 

   Later, in a switcheroo worthy of this out-of-whack season, the goat of that play met the press while the hero took a shower and a powder. 
"I tried to slide between two tacklers, and I felt one of them grab the ball," Byner manfully said later. 
"My first thought was to find it, but I guess somebody beat me to it." 
<PERSON>Castille</PERSON>'s version of the heist will have to await Super Bowl Hype Week, because he said he ain't talking until then. 

   His stance reminds us that, anticlimactic or not, we'll have an SB, numero 22, in <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> on <DATE>Jan. 31</DATE>. 
The Broncos will meet the Redskins, whose 17-10 home win over the <LOCATION>Minnesota Vikings</LOCATION> in <DATE>Sunday</DATE>'s early game at least gave the nation a chance for a nice nap before the Broncos-Browns thriller. 
And who knows? 
Historical evidence to the contrary notwithstanding, it could even be a good one. 
Possibly. 

   I mean, anything's possible, especially with young <PERSON>Mr. Elway</PERSON> on the scene. 
Here's a guy who looks like he's having fun on the <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION>'s corporate gridiron, scratching plays in the dirt and improvising when they don't develop as planned. 
No less a throwback is the formation from which he runs many of his plays. 
They call it the "shotgun," but close one eye and you could swear it was the single-wing of <PERSON>Merriwell</PERSON>'s day. 

   Elway's helter-skelter talents were displayed best <DATE>Sunday</DATE> in the touchdown that should have put away the <LOCATION>Browns</LOCATION>. 
After <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION> had scored on its first possession of the second half to cut the <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION> lead to 21-10, <PERSON>Elway</PERSON> faced a third-down and 10 from his own 20 yard line. 
He escaped two Browns tacklers, rebounded off one of his own blockers, sprinted to the right and, finally, found <PERSON>Mark Jackson</PERSON> open for a pass on the sideline five yards up field. 
<PERSON>Jackson</PERSON>, one of the <PERSON>Broncos</PERSON>' corps of small, speedy receivers, proceeded to dash 75 yards into the end zone to make it 28-10, <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION>. 

   "There was the primary receiver on that play, the secondary receiver, and me," <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON> later noted. 
"But with <PERSON>John</PERSON> scrambling the way he does, there's always a chance you'll get the ball." 

   Cleveland might have packed it in right there, or earlier after an interception and fumble led to first-half Bronco scores, but it didn't. 
Instead, its Bernie-and-Earnie show took over. 
On the <PERSON>Browns</PERSON>' next possession, <PERSON>Kosar</PERSON> hit passes of 12, 30 and 32 yards, the first and third of those to fullback Byner, to pull his team to within 11 points. 
After his mates stopped the Broncos on downs, <PERSON>Kosar</PERSON> connected on three straight passes and handed off to Byner for the final four yards in another touchdown drive. 

   A <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION> field goal made it 31-24. 
Kosar passed for 72 of 86 yards in a drive that tied it at 31. 
Denver got the lead back on five <PERSON>Elway</PERSON> passes from the single-wing (oops, shotgun), capped by a 20-yarder to <PERSON>Sammy Winder</PERSON> with four minutes left. 
Then the final, fatal, <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION> thrust. 

   Byner, a rugged sort who picked up little press ink at college (<LOCATION>East Carolina</LOCATION>) or in four useful pro seasons, ran for 67 yards and caught seven passes for 120 yards <DATE>Sunday</DATE>. 
So great was his contribution that his teammates, to a man, sought to shield him from the onus of his fumble. 
"Without him, we wouldn't have been close," declared <PERSON>Kosar</PERSON>. 
The QB might have said as much for himself. 
He passed for 356 yards on the day, to <PERSON>Elway</PERSON>'s 281. 

   In the contest's aftermath, the winners counted their blessings and the losers counted their disappointments. 
"I'm numb," said <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION> coach <PERSON>Dan Reeves</PERSON>. 
"The good Lord smiled on us today." 
"I'm frustrated, mad, disappointed," said <PERSON>Browns</PERSON> tackle <PERSON>Cody Risien</PERSON>. 
"After last year's game {a 23-20 Denver win in overtime}, I'm beginning to think Somebody Up There doesn't like us." 

   But <PERSON>Risien</PERSON> was fan enough to acknowledge the drama and quality of the fray, and wish for a rematch. 
One would certainly be fun. 
All in favor of staging it in <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> in two weeks raise your hands.

<PERSON>Jerry Van Dyke</PERSON>, in his role as dimwitted Luther Van Dam from "Coach," 
apologized on the air for having knocked <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION> two weeks ago in a 
promotional spot for the <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION> comedy, and the mayor accepted. 
</P>
<P>
The apology came in a promo as well. 
</P>
<P>
It was aired during the "<DATE>Monday</DATE> Night Football" game between the <PERSON>Cleveland 
Browns</PERSON> and the <LOCATION>Cincinnati Bengals</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"I just want to say that I'm sorry, <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION>, and I love <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION> and I love 
the people in it," <PERSON>Van Dyke</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor <PERSON>Michael R. White</PERSON> replied: "The <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION> of today and the <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION> of 15 
years ago are vastly different places. I think the apology frankly recognizes 
that there has been a major improvement." 
</P>
<P>
The joke that got <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION> so mad was broadcast <DATE>Oct. 8</DATE> during a <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> 
game between <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Van Dyke, a football coach in "Coach," said in the promo, "I think the problem 
with <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION> is, even if you win, you lose. You still got to go home to 
<LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION>." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the football season, a "Coach" promo made the same joke about 
<LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION>, incensing residents of that city.

Interim Coach <PERSON>Jim Shofner</PERSON>, who will lead the Browns against the <ORGANIZATION>Rams</ORGANIZATION> in 
<LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION> <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, said he hasn't really concerned himself with whether he will 
be back next season. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't even thought otherwise, really," <PERSON>Shofner</PERSON> said.

<P>
"You start doing the job, you just assume you're going to do it from now on,

"I think the players are looking for some stability and respect <PERSON>Jim Shofner</PERSON>,"

HE GETS GREAT RECEPTION;

FOOTBALL: BROWNS RECEIVER WEBSTER SLAUGHTER CAN FAKE AND TALK AND DANCE AND

<TEXT>
<P>
His <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> license plates read "WEB-STAR," and they deliver a significant 
message about <PERSON>Webster Slaughter</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
Five years after completing an outstanding career at <LOCATION>San Diego State</LOCATION>, Slaughter 
is the big-play man of the <LOCATION>Cleveland Browns</LOCATION> -- a player of <LOCATION>Pro Bowl</LOCATION> stature. He 
will pose big problems for the Chargers when they meet the <LOCATION>Browns</LOCATION> <DATE>Sunday</DATE> in 
<LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Ron Lynn</PERSON>, the Charger defensive coordinator, talked about the task of 
containing <PERSON>Webster</PERSON>, a 6-foot, 170-pounder whose 19-yard average per catch last 
season was the best in the AFC. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a marvelous player," <PERSON>Lynn</PERSON> said. "He makes tough catches, he makes 
acrobatic catches, he makes catches in a crowd. He catches balls he should 
catch and he catches balls he shouldn't catch. 
</P>
<P>
"He isn't a 4.2 guy (for 40 yards) -- only about 4.5 -- yet he's a deep threat, 
for several reasons. He has good timing with the quarterback (<PERSON>Bernie Kosar</PERSON>), he 
sets up the defenders well, and he explodes out of the break. 
</P>
<P>
"He'll talk trash with you, and that's part of his competitive nature. He's 
such a competitive guy that you can't let up on him. We'll probably double-team 
him a lot <DATE>Sunday</DATE>." 
</P>
<P>
Lynn called Slaughter and teammate <PERSON>Reggie Langhorne</PERSON> "probably the most 
underrated pair of receivers in the <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION>." 
</P>
<P>
Charger cornerback <PERSON>Gill Byrd</PERSON> compared Slaughter to a former teammate, <PERSON>Wes 
Chandler</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a faster version of <LOCATION>Chandler</LOCATION>," <PERSON>Byrd</PERSON> said. "Wes had that knack of getting 
open all the time. Slaughter reminds me of him. He always knows where the 
defensive back is going to be, and he has great quickness." 
</P>
<P>
Linebacker <PERSON>Gary Plummer</PERSON> said that when the Browns use a so-called gadget play, 
it's a good bet that Slaughter will be the key man. 
</P>
<P>
"They go to him for big yardage," <PERSON>Plummer</PERSON> said. "He'll run reverses and 
flea-flickers, and he'll catch halfback passes." 
</P>
<P>
Strong safety <PERSON>Marty Bayless</PERSON> cited another side of Slaughter's competitive 
nature. 
</P>
<P>
"He can be a showboat," <PERSON>Bayless</PERSON> said. "As small as he is, he's not afraid to 
take a lick, and when he gets up, he'll let you know he's around. He'll show 
the ball in your face or pat you on the butt or something like that. He can get 
you teed off. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing is, though, he's an underrated receiver. He's deceptive. He'll put 
you to sleep, maybe take a play off, but on the next play he'll be in the end 
zone dancing." 
</P>
<P>
Slaughter, who will be 26 on <DATE>Oct. 19</DATE>, has reached the end zone 20 times since 
the <PERSON>Browns</PERSON> made him their second-round draft choice in <DATE>1986</DATE>. He has caught 188 
passes for 3,164 yards, including six for 83 yards this season, after catching 
122 for 1,647 yards in two seasons at <LOCATION>San Diego State</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a burner, but I can get by anybody," <PERSON>Slaughter</PERSON> said by telephone from 
<LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION>. "The 4.2 guys usually don't have good hands. I'm fast enough." 
</P>
<P>
Fast enough, indeed. 
</P>
<P>
En route to leading the AFC in average per catch last year, Slaughter had 
receptions of 97, 80 and 77 yards. His 97-yarder against the <ORGANIZATION>Chicago Bears</ORGANIZATION> was 
a league high, and his 1,236-yard total set a club record. 
</P>
<P>
Slaughter, who has been hampered this season by what he calls a tender knee, 
appeared close to his old self when he caught five passes against the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> 
Jets last <DATE>Sunday</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been basically nicked up since training camp," <PERSON>Slaughter</PERSON> said. "The only 
thing that will help is rest, and there's no time for that." 
</P>
<P>
Slaughter's physical problem is one of the reasons for the anemic production of 
the <PERSON>Browns</PERSON>' offense in their first two games, one of which they won. 
</P>
<P>
"He's as important as anybody we have," Coach <PERSON>Bud Carson</PERSON> said. "He made as many 
big plays last year as anybody in the league except maybe <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>. We 
need him <PERCENT>100%</PERCENT>." 
</P>
<P>
One can grasp the degree of Slaughter's importance by the fact that many 
veteran observers consider him the <PERSON>Browns</PERSON>' best receiver since the days of <PERSON>Hall</PERSON> 
of Famer <PERSON>Paul Warfield</PERSON>, who retired in <DATE>1977</DATE>. In an interesting twist, it was 
Warfield, then scouting, who recommended that the Browns draft Slaughter. 
</P>
<P>
As good as he is on the football field, Slaughter's talents are anything but 
one-dimensional. In fact, he is so adept at playing a saxophone that he didn't 
even try out for football until his senior year at <ORGANIZATION>Franklin High School</ORGANIZATION> in 
<LOCATION>Stockton</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"I played in the band," he said. "We were No. 1 in the nation in the music 
Olympics in <LOCATION>Anaheim</LOCATION>. I played alto sax, then I switched to tenor. I was no 
football player. 
</P>
<P>
"Then before my senior year, one of the coaches saw me in a pickup basketball 
game and asked me to come out for football. Even after I made the team, I 
stayed with the band. I just couldn't march at the games. 
</P>
<P>
"I still play the sax whenever I get a chance, but I miss it sometimes. I like 
jazz and top-40 pop." 
</P>
<P>
Despite his lack of a football background, Slaughter was named to the 
all-conference team in his only high school season. Then he made such a good 
impression at <ORGANIZATION>San Joaquin Delta Junior College</ORGANIZATION> in <PERSON>Stockton</PERSON> that he received a 
flock of scholarship offers. 
</P>
<P>
"I narrowed it down to <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>San Diego State</LOCATION>," he said. "I picked <LOCATION>San 
Diego State</LOCATION> because it was closer to home and it was warmer. I had great 
coaching there, and I worked with an excellent quarterback in <PERSON>Todd Santos</PERSON>. Todd 
and I had great rapport." 
</P>
<P>
Slaughter's musical bent doesn't end with tooting a saxophone, either. He and 
<PERSON>Eric Metcalf</PERSON>, the <PERSON>Browns</PERSON>' game-breaking running back, were featured at halftime 
of <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION>'s Thanksgiving Day game last year. 
</P>
<P>
"I was rapping, and <PERSON>Eric</PERSON> was dancing," <PERSON>Slaughter</PERSON> said. "The reviews were pretty 
good." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the gig was written for 10 <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION> players, but eight failed to 
show up. Slaughter improvised. 
</P>
<P>
Slaughter adapts so easily to situations that a former <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION> columnist, <PERSON>Bob 
Kravitz</PERSON>, wrote recently, "He represents the very essence of cool. Cool shades. 
Cool duds. Cool car." 
</P>
<P>
Slaughter is even cool when he recalls the two times he fell asleep at the 
wheel of his car. 
</P>
<P>
"In my rookie year, we watched a highlight film downtown at night," he said. "I 
left early because I was sleepy. All the way home, I kept nodding off, and 
finally I fell asleep and hit the stone divider on a bridge. The car was 
totaled. 
</P>
<P>
"The following year, when we broke camp, I was going home, and the same thing 
happened. Luckily, I just hit a couple of mail boxes and no damage was done." 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, Slaughter does things his way. A year ago, he dreamed up an idea so 
drastic in the <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION>'s eyes that it led to a new rule. Hereafter, all players on 
a team must wear solid-color shoes and all must be the same color. You might 
call it the Webster Slaughter Rule. 
</P>
<P>
Before the <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> game in which he was to make his 97-yard reception, 
Slaughter painted his shoes orange and <PERSON>Metcalf</PERSON> did the same. Most of the <PERSON>Brown</PERSON> 
players were wearing shoes that were all or partially orange by the end the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"We painted just about everybody's shoes one way or another," <PERSON>Slaughter</PERSON> said. 
"Nobody put a stop to it, so we kept on painting. 
</P>
<P>
"We're wearing white now, but we've been working on a secret plan, so don't be 
surprised if you see orange again."

<P>
Don't look now, but the role as the <ORGANIZATION>Rams</ORGANIZATION>' primary tailback is beginning to slip 
out of <LOCATION>Cleveland Gary</LOCATION>'s hands as swiftly as those footballs have been the past 
three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
After <PERSON>Gary</PERSON> fumbled one away in <DATE>Sunday</DATE>'s first quarter -- his third lost fumble 
in three weeks -- Coach <PERSON>John Robinson</PERSON> yanked him in favor of little-used <PERSON>Gaston 
Green</PERSON>, and then after the <ORGANIZATION>Rams</ORGANIZATION>' 38-23 victory over the <PERSON>Browns</PERSON>, the coach had 
much praise for <ORGANIZATION>Green</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> didn't have quite so many kind words for <PERSON>Gary</PERSON>, however, who saw 
limited post-fumble time. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what you call on-the-job training," <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> said of the Gary hook. "He 
can't fumble the ball. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been negligent, I guess you'd almost say, in (not) playing <PERSON>Gaston</PERSON>. And he 
has earned the right to play on this football team." 
</P>
<P>
Green, who had only 31 carries all season before <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, rushed 13 times for 57 
yards and caught one pass for a 16-yard touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
"I really haven't had the chance too much in my career, so it felt good to get 
in there early and get some carries," Green said. "Coach <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> decides who 
plays when, and I just wanted to do everything I could in this opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
With <PERSON>Gary</PERSON>'s fumbles bothering <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON>, could Green begin to challenge for the 
starting spot? 
</P>
<P>
"I think they're both good players," <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> said. "I don't want it to be one 
of those teeter-totters where one's up, the other's down, but they're both good 
players. Gaston has proven that he can do some things." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Kevin Greene</PERSON> said he was just as surprised as everybody else when the referee 
waived off his apparent forced fumble on a sack of <PERSON>Bernie Kosar</PERSON>, Browns 
quarterback. <PERSON>Greene</PERSON> came at <PERSON>Kosar</PERSON> from the blind side, and the ball appeared to 
spring loose on impact. It was recovered by defensive tackle <PERSON>Alvin Wright</PERSON>, but 
the referee ruled <PERSON>Kosar</PERSON> was in <PERSON>Greene</PERSON>'s grasp and blew the play dead as a sack. 
</P>
<P>
"In the grasp?" said <PERSON>Greene</PERSON>, who had three sacks <DATE>Sunday</DATE>. "I hit him. I hit him. 
OK, I can understand if I was pulling him to the ground and then he fumbled. 
OK. But I thought I put a pretty good shot on him." 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>Rams</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Browns</PERSON> were involved in some pushing and shoving in the final 
moments of the game when the Rams were deep in <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION> territory and trying 
to get their newest running back, <PERSON>Marcus Dupree</PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
After <PERSON>Dupree</PERSON> dived into the line, several <PERSON>Browns</PERSON> appeared to take swings at him 
in the pile, and one player seemed to be twisting his leg after the play was 
blown dead. 
</P>
<P>
"Man, I was saying, 'What's going on? What's going on?' " said <PERSON>Dupree</PERSON>, who got 
his first playing time since the <ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION>' game and gained eight yards in two 
carries. "I had to get up fighting, get a little respect," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bud <PERSON>Carson</PERSON> is gone, fired as the <PERSON>Browns</PERSON>' coach four weeks ago, and in <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION> 
they're campaigning for a similar fate for owner Art <ORGANIZATION>Modell</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Two T-shirts were making the rounds at <LOCATION>Cleveland Stadium</LOCATION> <DATE>Sunday</DATE>. One read: 
Losing Is A Work of Art. The other featured mug shots of the Three Stooges with 
the following inscription: <PERSON>Larry</PERSON>, Curly and Moe-dell. 
</P>
<P>
Bigger messages were reserved for the bedsheet banners hanging all over the 
stadium. A sampling: 
</P>
<P>
 Art + Modell = 2 and 9. 
</P>
<P>
 Dear <LOCATION>Santa</LOCATION>, We Want A New Owner. 
</P>
<P>

 Hey Art, Stop The Maddness.

Hey Dawgs, check your spelling.

<TEXT>
<P>
In a game filled with errors common to exhibition openers, <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> 
quarterback <PERSON>Don McPherson</PERSON> and wide receiver <PERSON>Gizmo Williams</PERSON> came up with a 
picture-perfect play that helped the Eagles beat the <LOCATION>Cleveland Browns</LOCATION>, 17-13, 
in the fourth annual American Bowl played <DATE>Sunday</DATE> in front of 73,677 at <ORGANIZATION>Wembley 
Stadium</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
An interception by safety <PERSON>Tom Gerhart</PERSON> four plays after <PERSON>McPherson</PERSON> failed to 
scored on a fourth-and-goal play gave the Eagles the ball at their 48 and set 
up a 34-yard McPherson-to-Williams touchdown pass play that gave <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> a 
17-6 lead with 10:31 left. 
</P>
<P>
The loss spoiled the coaching debut of <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Bud Carson</LOCATION>, former Ram 
defensive coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>McPherson</PERSON>, a second-year pro from <LOCATION>Syracuse</LOCATION>, replaced <ORGANIZATION>Eagle</ORGANIZATION> starter <PERSON>Randall 
Cunningham</PERSON> at the beginning of the <DATE>second quarter</DATE> with the Eagles leading, 7-0. 
</P>
<P>
After his missed opportunity at the goal line, <PERSON>McPherson</PERSON> made the most of the 
second chance that <PERSON>Gerhart</PERSON>'s interception gave him. McPherson passed nine yards 
to <PERSON>Robert Drummond</PERSON> for a first down. Then after <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION> was called for 
holding, negating a sack, <PERSON>McPherson</PERSON> looped the ball into the right corner of 
the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Williams</ORGANIZATION>, who signed with the <ORGANIZATION>Eagles</ORGANIZATION> in the off-season from the <ORGANIZATION>Canadian 
Football League</ORGANIZATION>, dove for the ball and made a fingertip catch, ending the play 
with a forward roll. He tossed the ball to an official, then did a forward flip 
in the air -- a move that cost the Eagles five yards on the ensuing kickoff for 
showboating. 
</P>
<P>
"He's got to learn to play <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> football. He can get away with that in <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>," 
<ORGANIZATION>Eagle Coach Buddy Ryan</ORGANIZATION> said. "The jury is still out on <ORGANIZATION>Gizmo Williams</ORGANIZATION>."

RAIDERS WILL BE A CHALLENGE FOR ADOLPH; 
</P>
<P>
NEW DEFENSIVE COACH WILL FIND THINGS DIFFERENT FROM CLEVELAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
<PERSON>Dave Adolph</PERSON>'s dog days are over. 
</P>
<P>
Or are they? 
</P>
<P>
Adolph, defensive coordinator for the <LOCATION>Cleveland Browns</LOCATION> the last 3 seasons, was 
hired by the <ORGANIZATION>Raiders</ORGANIZATION> <DATE>Friday</DATE> to perform the same function. 
</P>
<P>
Officially, the 51-year-old <ORGANIZATION>Adolph</ORGANIZATION> will coach the linebackers along with <PERSON>Sam 
Gruneisen</PERSON> and "organize the defense." The Raiders don't use the term defensive 
coordinator, but <PERSON>Adolph</PERSON> will be calling the defensive signals. 
</P>
<P>
He thus jumps from a team with the third-best defense in the league and those 
wild fans in the Dog Pound to one of the worst defenses in Raider history and 
those wild rumors of a team split by a power struggle. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders finished the <DATE>1988</DATE> season at 7-9 with their defense in a shambles. 
The team surrendered 369 points, its highest total since <DATE>1962</DATE> in the old 
free-wheeling days of the <ORGANIZATION>American Football League</ORGANIZATION>. With a shot at the playoffs 
remaining on the final <DATE>Sunday</DATE> of the season, the <ORGANIZATION>Raiders</ORGANIZATION> gave up 43 points and 
490 yards in total offense in losing to the <LOCATION>Seattle Seahawks</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
And then the real blood bath began. 
</P>
<P>
Defensive coordinator <PERSON>Charlie Sumner</PERSON>: Fired. 
</P>
<P>
Defensive backfield coach <PERSON>Willie Brown</PERSON>, an <PERSON>Al Davis</PERSON> favorite: Fired. 
</P>
<P>
Receiver coach <PERSON>Nick Nicolau</PERSON>, a <PERSON>Mike Shanahan</PERSON> guy: Fired. 
</P>
<P>
Defensive line coach <PERSON>Earl Leggett</PERSON>: Resigned. 
</P>
<P>
Defensive backfield coach <PERSON>Jimmy Warren</PERSON>: Reportedly cleaned out his desk, went 
home to <LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION> and was said to have been fired by one of the news services, 
but remains employed according to the <ORGANIZATION>Raiders</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Warren's status is relatively stable, however, compared to the off-again, 
on-again position of assistants <PERSON>Tom Walsh</PERSON> and <PERSON>Joe Scannella</PERSON>, pawns in an 
apparent struggle between <PERSON>Davis</PERSON>, the managing general partner, and <PERSON>Shanahan</PERSON>, 
the head coach. Shanahan reportedly fired <PERSON>Walsh</PERSON> and Scannella at season's end 
only to have <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> turn around and reinstate them. 
</P>
<P>
Into this steps <PERSON>Adolph</PERSON> who brings with him 27 years of coaching experience. 
Some skill as a mediator probably wouldn't hurt either. 
</P>
<P>
Adolph was a defensive assistant in his first tour of duty with <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION>, 
1979-84, went to the <LOCATION>San Diego Chargers</LOCATION> for a year, then returned to <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
A guard-linebacker at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Akron</ORGANIZATION>, in his hometown, <PERSON>Adolph</PERSON> began 
his coaching career in <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION> at the high school level in <DATE>1962</DATE>. After a 
year, he moved into the collegiate ranks, spending time at <LOCATION>Akron</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION>, 
<LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION> and at <ORGANIZATION>Ohio State</ORGANIZATION> under <PERSON>Woody Hayes</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
"The addition of <PERSON>Dave Adolph</PERSON> to our staff couldn't please me more," <PERSON>Shanahan</PERSON> 
said. "<PERSON>Dave</PERSON> is an extremely knowledgeable coach who has the reputation of being 
an excellent teacher as well as a motivator."

RAIDERS GAIN ON DEFENSE, LOSE ON OFFENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK HEISLER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>Raiders</ORGANIZATION> found one of the missing pieces in the puzzle of their defense . . 
. but lost one from their offense <DATE>Friday</DATE>, as the signing period for 
unrestricted free agents moved into its final hours. 
</P>
<P>
From the <ORGANIZATION>Cleveland Browns</ORGANIZATION>, they signed <PERSON>Bob Golic</PERSON>, the 31-year-old, three-time 
Pro Bowl nose tackle they've been looking for since the departure of <PERSON>Reggie 
Kinlaw</PERSON> in <DATE>1985</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
To the <LOCATION>San Diego Chargers</LOCATION>, they lost tight end <PERSON>Andy Parker</PERSON>, the starter last 
season after <PERSON>Todd Christensen</PERSON> was hurt. The little-known <PERSON>Parker</PERSON> is a better 
blocker and was expected to retain the starting job this season even with 
<PERSON>Christensen</PERSON> back. 
</P>
<P>
Golic's agent, <PERSON>Ralph Cindrich</PERSON>, confirmed that his client had been "signed, 
sealed and delivered," and after a day of inquiries, the <ORGANIZATION>Raiders</ORGANIZATION> announced it, 
too. 
</P>
<P>
The team made no mention of <PERSON>Parker</PERSON>, but he signed a Charger contract <DATE>Friday</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
The <PERSON>Golic</PERSON> story is a big one in <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION>, where he was born and became a local 
star and community leader. An All-American linebacker at <LOCATION>Notre Dame</LOCATION>, he was a 
No. 2 pick of the <ORGANIZATION>New England Patriots</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1979</DATE> but was waived in <DATE>1982</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
He was then picked up by the <PERSON>Browns</PERSON>, who converted him to nose tackle. 
Free-spirited and fun-loving, he gave new style to the position he picked up so 
quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Said <PERSON>Golic</PERSON>: "A nose tackle is like a fire hydrant." 
</P>
<P>
And: "I'm 6-3 on <DATE>Saturday</DATE> nights, but 6-0 on <DATE>Sunday</DATE> nights." 
</P>
<P>
Golic is best known as a run defender, which will come in handy for the 
<ORGANIZATION>Raiders</ORGANIZATION>, whose rushing defense fell apart last season. 
</P>
<P>
Since waiving <PERSON>Kinlaw</PERSON>, a star of the '84 Super Bowl, they had tried the 6-5 <PERSON>Bill 
Pickel</PERSON>, a natural defensive tackle, at the nose, with progressively worse 
results. Last season, the <ORGANIZATION>Raiders</ORGANIZATION> largely abandoned their old base defense for 
a four-man line -- at the order of <PERSON>Al Davis</PERSON>, who wanted more pressure. 
Meanwhile, other players petitioned the coaches to bring back the 3-4, since it 
was the only run defense they knew how to play. 
</P>
<P>
Said Golic: "With two great pass rushers, they need someone with a big butt in 
the middle to tie up the guard and the center and stop the run." 
</P>
<P>
The signing was precipitated by changes on the Raiders and the <LOCATION>Browns</LOCATION>. The new 
Raider defensive coordinator, <PERSON>Dave Adolph</PERSON>, comes from <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION>. The new <PERSON>Brown</PERSON> 
head coach, <PERSON>Bud Carson</PERSON>, the former <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> Jets' defensive coordinator, plans 
to put in a four-man line. 
</P>
<P>
Golic signed a two-year contract, which will pay him <MONEY>$600,000</MONEY> and <MONEY>$650,000</MONEY>, 
respectively. 
</P>
<P>
His welcome to the <ORGANIZATION>Raiders</ORGANIZATION> seems well on its way. While visiting the Raider 
facility, he stayed at the home of <ORGANIZATION>Howie Long</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Parker signed a two-year contract which, with makeable incentives, reportedly 
will pay him <MONEY>$400,000</MONEY> a year, a big increase over the <MONEY>$175,000</MONEY> he made last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers, under new Coach <PERSON>Dan Henning</PERSON>, the former <ORGANIZATION>Washington Redskins</ORGANIZATION> 
assistant, are expected to go to a double tight-end alignment, and <PERSON>Parker</PERSON> is 
expected to start. 
</P>
<P>
A No. 5 pick from <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION> in <DATE>1984</DATE>, the 6-foot-5, 245-pounder played on special 
teams until <PERSON>Christensen</PERSON> was hurt last season. Coach <PERSON>Mike Shanahan</PERSON>'s preference 
for the better blocker led him to <PERSON>Parker</PERSON>, rather than the smaller, faster <PERSON>Trey 
Junkin</PERSON>, a better pass receiver. <PERSON>Christensen</PERSON>'s listed weight is only 230, and, 
despite his years of pass receiving prowess, <PERSON>Shanahan</PERSON> was thought to be leaning 
toward keeping <PERSON>Parker</PERSON> No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
The signing period ends today. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders have added <PERSON>Golic</PERSON>; linebackers <PERSON>Otis Wilson</PERSON> from the <ORGANIZATION>Chicago Bears</ORGANIZATION>, 
<PERSON>Jackie Shipp</PERSON> from the <LOCATION>Miami Dolphins</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Emanuel King</PERSON> from the <LOCATION>Cincinnati 
Bengals</LOCATION>; offensive lineman <PERSON>Dale Hellestrae</PERSON> of the <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> Bills, and 
placekicker <PERSON>Jeff Jaeger</PERSON> of the Browns. They were talking with <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> 
cornerback <PERSON>Mike Richardson</PERSON>, who is in the Bears' doghouse, but haven't made a 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders have lost <PERSON>Parker</PERSON>; linebacker <PERSON>Reggie McKenzie</PERSON> to the <LOCATION>Phoenix 
Cardinals</LOCATION>; kick returner <PERSON>Chris Woods</PERSON> to the <LOCATION>Browns</LOCATION>; running backs <PERSON>Chris 
McLemore</PERSON> to the <LOCATION>Seattle Seahawks</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Reggie Ware</PERSON> to the <LOCATION>Denver Broncos</LOCATION>. Only 
<PERSON>Parker</PERSON> and <PERSON>McKenzie</PERSON> were on the active roster throughout last season, and only 
<PERSON>Parker</PERSON> figured prominently in Raider plans.

<LEADPARA>  National Football League legend Paul Brown, who founded the Cleveland Browns

morning. He was 82.;    Bengals spokesman Allan Heim said Brown died at his
home in Cincinnati from complications caused by pneumonia.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  NFL LEGEND PAUL BROWN DIES AT 82  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     "He's certainly one of the key figures in professional sports," former
Bengals quarterback <PERSON>Ken Anderson</PERSON> said. "Football would not be what it is
without him. He was always concerned about his guys after football. Football
was just a steppingstone. He wanted you to prepare for your life's work.";   
<PERSON>Brown</PERSON> began his coaching career in <DATE>1930</DATE> after graduating from <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> (<LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>)
University, where he was a star quarterback.;    After coaching at a high
school in <LOCATION>Massillon</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, and at <ORGANIZATION>Ohio State</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Brown</PERSON> formed the Browns of the
<ORGANIZATION>All America Conference</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1946</DATE> and coached the team. The Browns captured all
four titles in the league's existence before entering the <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1950</DATE>. They
won championship that year -- the first of their three titles in the 1950s.;  
 The <DATE>1960s</DATE> saw <PERSON>Brown</PERSON> get fired in <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION>, win election to the <ORGANIZATION>Pro Football
Hall of Fame</ORGANIZATION> and form the Bengals expansion franchise that he coached until
<DATE>1975</DATE>. He continued to run the <ORGANIZATION>Bengals</ORGANIZATION>' operations as vice president and
general manager.;    "I couldn't go back (into football after <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION>)
unless I was in complete charge," he said. "I had it both ways -- when the
<PERSON>Browns</PERSON> started -- and for a long time after -- I was in complete charge. . . .
And that's the way it must be. . . . The history of all successful teams shows
how authority concentrated in the coach.";    Former Bengals offensive lineman
<PERSON>Dave Lapham</PERSON> praised <PERSON>Brown</PERSON>'s organizational skills.;    "I think that the real
key to the success of <PERSON>Paul Brown</PERSON> was his organizational ability," <PERSON>Lapham</PERSON> said.
"He basically structured his football team as a CEO would his company.";    It
was as a coach that <PERSON>Brown</PERSON> made his biggest mark on the game. He was known for
his innovations -- introducing classroom techniques that are commonplace
today, using film to grade players, calling plays from the sideline.;    He
ran his team with a seriousness that shaped his image.;    "I was a
serious-looking guy," he said. "Of course, you can't exactly do much about how
you look. They formed images of <LOCATION>me.</LOCATION>;    "Every time we'd go to <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> to
play the Giants -- and were beating them pretty regularly -- I'd get a new
term. The first one was 'the cold, calculating <PERSON>Brown</PERSON>.' Then I got to be
'deadly'; we were winning too much," he said, laughing. "Cold, deadly,
calculating.";    And a winner. <PERSON>Brown</PERSON> had a 213-104-9 record as a
professional.;    He is survived by his wife, <PERSON>Mary</PERSON>, and two sons, <PERSON>Mike</PERSON> and
<PERSON>Pete</PERSON>. <PERSON>Mike</PERSON> is the Bengals' assistant general manager, and <PERSON>Pete</PERSON> is director of
player personnel. His first wife, <PERSON>Katy</PERSON>, died in <DATE>1969</DATE>. Another son, <PERSON>Robin</PERSON>, died
in <DATE>1978.</DATE>;    <PERSON>Heim</PERSON> said a funeral is scheduled <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME> at <ORGANIZATION>St.

<P>
The Chargers announced <DATE>Friday</DATE> the acquisition of two more unrestricted free 
agents, both from <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION> neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
The signings of former Raider tight end <PERSON>Andy Parker</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>San Dieguito</LOCATION> High 
graduate, and former Ram linebacker <PERSON>Jim Collins</PERSON> gave the Chargers seven under 
the <ORGANIZATION>National Football League</ORGANIZATION>'s new free agent policy. The deadline for such 
signings is 9 o'clock tonight. 
</P>
<P>
While losing <PERSON>Parker</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>Raiders</ORGANIZATION> signed 31-year-old <PERSON>Bob Golic</PERSON>, a three-time Pro 
Bowl nose tackle for the <ORGANIZATION>Cleveland Browns</ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION>Rams</ORGANIZATION> also lost former Charger 
tight end <PERSON>Eric Sievers</PERSON>, to <LOCATION>New England</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Parker, 6-feet-5, 245 pounds, signed a two-year Charger contract that, with 
attainable incentives, reportedly will pay him <MONEY>$400,000</MONEY> a year, a big increase 
over the <MONEY>$175,000</MONEY> he made last season. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers, under new Coach <PERSON>Dan Henning</PERSON>, are expected to go to a double 
tight-end alignment, and <PERSON>Parker</PERSON> is expected to start. 
</P>
<P>
A No. 5 pick from <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION> in <DATE>1984</DATE>, <PERSON>Parker</PERSON> played on special teams until <PERSON>Todd 
Christensen</PERSON> was hurt last season. Parker, 15 pounds heavier and a better 
blocker than <PERSON>Christensen</PERSON>, was expected to retain his starting job despite 
<PERSON>Christensen</PERSON>'s years of pass-receiving prowess. 
</P>
<P>
Parker, 27, has just six catches in his <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> career, including four for 33 yards 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
He attended <LOCATION>San Dieguito</LOCATION> after two years at <PERSON>Dana Hills High</PERSON> in <ORGANIZATION>Dana Point</ORGANIZATION>. At 
<LOCATION>San Dieguito</LOCATION>, he was first-team All-Palomar League and the team's most valuable 
player in football and also participated in basketball, baseball and track. He 
was <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION>'s leading receiver as a senior with 33 catches for 395 yards in <DATE>1983</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Collins</PERSON>, 30, appeared in just four games for the Rams last season after 
spending the first 12 weeks on injured reserve with a knee injury. Once perhaps 
the team's top defensive player, <PERSON>Collins</PERSON> has been slowed in recent years by 
serious injuries. He missed all of <DATE>1986</DATE> with a neck injury and underwent 
arthroscopic surgery last <DATE>summer</DATE> to repair a chronically damaged right knee. 
</P>
<P>
Collins, 6-2, 233 pounds, has no cartilage in the knee, but played well after 
returning to the lineup late last season. His best season was <DATE>1985</DATE>, when he led 
the <ORGANIZATION>Rams</ORGANIZATION> in tackles with 140 and was named to the <LOCATION>Pro Bowl</LOCATION>. He has started 67 
of 80 career games. 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>Rams</ORGANIZATION> claimed <PERSON>Sievers</PERSON> on waivers from the Chargers last <DATE>December</DATE> and had 
plans for him as a blocking tight end this season. Sievers appeared on special 
teams in the <ORGANIZATION>Rams</ORGANIZATION>' season-ending win over <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The <PERSON>Golic</PERSON> story is a big one in <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION>, where he was born and became a local 
star and community leader. An All-America linebacker at <LOCATION>Notre Dame</LOCATION>, he was a 
No. 2 pick of the <ORGANIZATION>New England Patriots</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1979</DATE> but was waived in <DATE>1982</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
He was then picked up by the <PERSON>Browns</PERSON>, who converted him to nose tackle. 
Free-spirited and fun-loving, he gave new style to the position he picked up so 
quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Said <PERSON>Golic</PERSON>: "A nose tackle is like a fire hydrant." 
</P>
<P>
And: "I'm 6-3 on <DATE>Saturday</DATE> nights, but 6-0 on <DATE>Sunday</DATE> nights." 
</P>
<P>
Golic is best known as a run defender, which will come in handy for the 
<ORGANIZATION>Raiders</ORGANIZATION>, whose rushing defense fell apart last season. Since waiving <PERSON>Reggie 
Kinlaw</PERSON>, a hero of the '84 Super Bowl, they had tried the 6-5 <PERSON>Bill Pickel</PERSON>, a 
natural defensive tackle, at the nose, with progressively worse results. Last 
season, the <ORGANIZATION>Raiders</ORGANIZATION> largely abandoned their old base defense for a four-man 
line -- at the order of <PERSON>Al Davis</PERSON> who wanted more pressure. Meanwhile, other 
players petitioned the coaches to bring back the 3-4, since it was the only run 
defense they knew how to play. 
</P>
<P>
Said Golic: "With two great pass rushers, they need someone with a big butt in 
the middle to tie up the guard and the center and stop the run." 
</P>
<P>
The signing was precipitated by changes on the Raiders and the <LOCATION>Browns</LOCATION>. The new 
Raider defensive coordinator, <PERSON>Dave Adolph</PERSON>, comes from <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION>. The new 
<PERSON>Browns</PERSON>' head coach, <PERSON>Bud Carson</PERSON>, the old Jets' defensive coordinator, plans to 
put in a four-man line. 
</P>
<P>
Golic signed a two-year contract, which will pay him <MONEY>$600,000</MONEY> and <MONEY>$650,000</MONEY>. 
</P>
<P>
His welcome to the <ORGANIZATION>Raiders</ORGANIZATION> seems well on its way. While visiting the Raider 
facility, he stayed at the home of <ORGANIZATION>Howie Long</ORGANIZATION>.

<P>
The <LOCATION>San Diego Chargers</LOCATION> earned their first victory of the season, beating the 
<LOCATION>Cleveland Browns</LOCATION>, 24-14, <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, and Coach <PERSON>Dan Henning</PERSON> gave credit to <PERSON>Dennis 
Conner</PERSON>, of all people. 
</P>
<P>
Henning used the yachtman's <DATE>1978</DATE> book, "No Excuse to Lose," for inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
"I think <PERSON>Dennis Conner</PERSON> should take a bow for this win," <PERSON>Henning</PERSON> said. "I met 
him on a flight back from <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> in <DATE>July</DATE> and asked him to send me his book. 
We got to talking about some of the things he goes through to put a crew and 
challenge together, and I thought they were very poignant in relation to our 
stuff. 
</P>
<P>
"The media and fans give you all kinds of reasons and excuses, like you're too 
young, you haven't been together long enough, your quarterback is not 
experienced enough. All those things are true, but it's probably true for 20 
other teams, too. 
</P>
<P>
"I talked with the team about it," <PERSON>Henning</PERSON> said. "I told them I wasn't going to 
give them any excuses, and they shouldn't give themselves any. And I got that 
commitment from them." 
</P>
<P>
He also got: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Touchdown passes of 19 and 23 yards from <PERSON>Billy Joe Tolliver</PERSON> to <PERSON>Anthony 
Miller</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A game-turning 67-yard interception return from linebacker <ORGANIZATION>Henry Rolling</ORGANIZATION> to 
set up a one-yard scoring run by <PERSON>Rod Bernstine</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A doggone good pass rush on the <ORGANIZATION>Dawg Pound</ORGANIZATION>'s kennel master, 
<PERSON>quarterbackBernie Kosar</PERSON>, who threw three interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A 42-yard job-saving field goal to open the game's scoring from <PERSON>Fuad 
Reveiz</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Kickoff coverage that buried the <PERSON>Browns</PERSON>' <PERSON>Eric Metcalf</PERSON>, who was averaging 34 
yards a return, to 12.8 yards a carry. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Individual outstanding performances from <PERSON>Marion Butts</PERSON>, <PERSON>Craig McEwen</PERSON> and 
<PERSON>Ronnie Harmon</PERSON> on offense, and <PERSON>Lee Williams</PERSON>, <PERSON>Martin Bayless</PERSON> and <PERSON>Sam Seale</PERSON> on 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
"No excuses, that's what Coach <PERSON>Henning</PERSON> stressed to us the night before the 
game, and then again in the <TIME>morning</TIME>," cornerback <PERSON>Gill Byrd</PERSON> said. "He said it 
was just time to win." 
</P>
<P>
Down 14-10 at halftime, the Chargers posted their first second-half points of 
the season against a defense that had not allowed a score in either the third 
or fourth quarters this season. 
</P>
<P>
And they did it by sticking with an erratic <PERSON>Tolliver</PERSON> at the controls. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been asked, when <PERSON>Billy</PERSON>'s struggling, do you change the quarterback?" 
<PERSON>Henning</PERSON> said. "Well, <PERSON>Billy</PERSON> wasn't the only one struggling out there. We had 
some young people make some errors in movement, and we had some young people 
make some errors in routes, and even a veteran quarterback is going to look 
shaky under those conditions." 
</P>
<P>
Tolliver finished 12 of 29 for 139 yards with a pair of interceptions. At 
halftime he was eight of 22 for 86 yards with those two interceptions, and no, 
<PERSON>Henning</PERSON> said, he never gave a thought to warming up <PERSON>Mark Vlasic</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
Tolliver's first two passes <DATE>Sunday</DATE> were incomplete and his third was 
intercepted by linebacker <PERSON>Mike Johnson</PERSON> and returned 64 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
But things got better, particularly in the <DATE>second half after Tolliver</DATE>'s 23-yard 
strike to <PERSON>Miller</PERSON> put the Chargers ahead to stay.

<HEAD>Cleveland Mayor Accepts Apology for Joke</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 5th graf pvs, `The joke ...' to FIX typo in `mad.'</NOTE>
<DATELINE>CLEVELAND (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   <PERSON>Jerry Van Dyke</PERSON>, in his role as dimwitted Luther
Van Dam from ``Coach,'' apologized on the air for having knocked
<LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION> two weeks ago in an promotional spot for the <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION> comedy,
and the mayor accepted.
   The apology came in a promo as well. It was aired during the
<DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> football game between the <LOCATION>Cleveland Browns</LOCATION> and the
<LOCATION>Cincinnati Bengals</LOCATION>.
   ``I just want to say that I'm sorry, <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION>, and I love
<LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION> and I love the people in it,'' Van Dam said.
   Mayor <PERSON>Michael R. White</PERSON> replied: ``The <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION> of today and the
<LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION> of 15 years ago are vastly different places. I think the
apology frankly recognizes that there has been a major
improvement.''
   The joke that got <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION> so mad was broadcast <DATE>Oct. 8</DATE> during a
<DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> football game between <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION>.
   Van Dam, a football coach in ``Coach,'' said in the promo, ``I
think the problem with <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION> is, even if you win, you lose. You
still got to go home to <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION>.''
   <PERSON>Dale R. Finley</PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION>Cleveland Convention and
Visitors Bureau</ORGANIZATION>, said the joke reflected an image created when the
city's oil-slicked <LOCATION>Cuyahoga River</LOCATION> caught fire 20 years ago and the
city went into default in <DATE>1978</DATE>.
   The city has since changed, he said.

WALSH REPORTEDLY QUITS AS COACH OF 49ERS

Bill <PERSON>Walsh</PERSON> will give up the head coaching job of the Super Bowl champion <LOCATION>San 
Francisco</LOCATION> 49ers, published reports <DATE>today</DATE> said, and there were strong 
indications that he will be replaced by defensive coordinator <PERSON>George Seifert</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Walsh</PERSON>, who reportedly will take another job in the organization, has supported 
<PERSON>Seifert</PERSON> as his replacement and <PERSON>Seifert</PERSON> reportedly cut short a trip to <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION> 
to discuss the Browns coaching job and returned to <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
A source told <ORGANIZATION>The Associated Press</ORGANIZATION> today that <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION> was now leaning toward 
hiring <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> Jets defensive coordinator <LOCATION>Bud Carson</LOCATION>. Browns owner Art <PERSON>Modell</PERSON> 
said he would meet with <PERSON>Carson</PERSON> tonight. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION>New York Daily News</ORGANIZATION> reported today that sources close to the 
situation said <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> owner <PERSON>Eddie DeBartolo Jr.</PERSON> wanted a high-profile 
coach like <PERSON>Jimmy Johnson</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>University of Miami</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh, <ORGANIZATION>DeBartolo</ORGANIZATION> and their attorneys met <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> for two hours in the villa 
DeBartolo is occupying this week while playing in the <LOCATION>Pebble Beach</LOCATION> Pro-Am golf 
tournament, the <ORGANIZATION>San Francisco Examiner</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>today</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Comment 
</P>
<P>
Neither <PERSON>Walsh</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>DeBartolo</ORGANIZATION> nor <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON>, reportedly out of his office <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> on 
a recruiting trip, was available for comment. DeBartolo had said <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> that 
it may be three weeks before a final determination is made on <PERSON>Walsh</PERSON>'s status. 
</P>
<P>
However, <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> Sports Information Director <PERSON>Rich Dalrymple</PERSON>, who said he spoke 
with <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> today, quoted the coach as saying: "It's just a rumor. I have had 
no contact with the <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> 49ers." 
</P>
<P>
The San Jose <ORGANIZATION>Mercury News</ORGANIZATION>, citing a source close to the 49ers, reported today 
that <PERSON>Walsh</PERSON> has told his assistants that he will not return for an 11th season, 
but will remain with the team in the front office. 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>Examiner</ORGANIZATION> quoted 49ers Vice President and <ORGANIZATION>General Counsel Carmen Policy</ORGANIZATION> as 
saying a meeting of team officials would be held <DATE>today</DATE> -- after DeBartolo 
finishes his golf commitment. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether <PERSON>Walsh</PERSON> definitely is leaving as coach and whether <PERSON>Seifert</PERSON> would be 
elevated to replace him, Policy on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> responded: "I can't say, but 
all parties are on the same page." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Seifert</PERSON>, a leading candidate for the <ORGANIZATION>Cleveland Browns</ORGANIZATION>' vacant head coach 
position, was en route to <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION> on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> and booked a room in a hotel 
there. But after arriving in <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> to change planes, he canceled the second 
leg of his trip and booked a return flight to <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>.

VICTORY IS TAKEN IN STRIDE;

<P>
RAMS: L.A. BEATS CLEVELAND, 38-23, BUT TEAM KNOWS BETTER THAN TO GET OVERLY 
EXCITED ABOUT SUCCESS.

<TEXT>
<P>
Revived, relieved and reluctant to jinx their little run of success by 
recklessly predicting even greater things, the Rams <DATE>Sunday</DATE> settled into their 
first winning streak of the season calmly and without the normal chortles of 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
Having lived through their abysmal 3-7 start, they knew better. 
</P>
<P>
Everybody who has watched this team stagger into <DATE>December</DATE> knows better than to 
start plotting rosy playoff scenarios. 
</P>
<P>
Are they back? Are they the poltergeist of this weird <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> season, coming back 
to haunt the <ORGANIZATION>NFC</ORGANIZATION> contenders? Or is playing the curiously atrocious Cleveland 
Browns (2-10) merely a temporary cure for all ills? 
</P>
<P>
<DATE>Sunday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME>, after methodically dismantling the Browns, 38-23, all the 
Rams knew was that a 5-7 record is better than 4-8; and that a loss in a city 
that knows about wasted seasons would have been tantamount to throwing in the 
towel for <DATE>1990</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
They knew because Coach <PERSON>John Robinson</PERSON>, in the days leading up to this game -- 
and after the <ORGANIZATION>Rams</ORGANIZATION>' adrenaline-high victory over the <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> 49ers <DATE>last 
Sunday</DATE> -- told them so. 
</P>
<P>
 If you can't beat the Browns.... 
</P>
<P>
 "What I was trying to say was that we've screwed this thing up pretty good 
before <DATE>last Sunday</DATE>," <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> said. "This, now, is kind of a last chance to get 
back to being the kind of year that we want to feel proud of ourselves. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"If it's just going to be from the <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> game to the end of the year, 
that's what we're trying to do. If we reverted back to being the other kind of 
football team today, then that would've been really tough for us in terms of 
just our self-respect." 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>Rams</ORGANIZATION>' self-respect was safe almost from the outset on <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, but it 
appeared that the <PERSON>Browns</PERSON>' might be a lost cause. The Ram offense, after 
tailback <LOCATION>Cleveland Gary</LOCATION>'s third fumble in as many games, jumped out early and 
hard, and the <PERSON>Browns</PERSON>' defense did not have the talent, scheme or heart to 
respond. The <PERSON>Browns</PERSON> have lost seven in a row and show signs that seven might 
turn into 11. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback <PERSON>Jim Everett</PERSON>, who had thrown only one touchdown pass in his last 
five games and who declared his team out of the playoff hunt three weeks ago, 
threw four against the Browns -- who, oddly, found no reason to cover the Ram 
running backs. 
</P>
<P>
Everett, who was 22 for 29 for 261 yards, retired his crystal ball and threw 
his team's fate into the chill <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> wind. It was a day for that. 
</P>
<P>
"I said before that I thought we were out of the playoff picture," <PERSON>Everett</PERSON> 
said. "But if something happens and we're in it, great. If not, we know that it 
was what we did early in the season that kept us out of it." 
</P>
<P>
If the Rams do poke their heads back into playoff contention, it was clear 
<DATE>Sunday</DATE> that the offense will have to take them there. 
</P>
<P>
They stirred memories -- particularly of those Everett-led shoot-'em-ups of a 
year ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Things are starting to roll for us," said tailback <PERSON>Gaston Green</PERSON>, who got the 
bulk of action after <PERSON>Gary</PERSON>'s fumble and used the opportunity to run for 57 yards 
on 13 carries, catch a 16-yard touchdown pass and generally impress anyone who 
has seen him stand on the Ram sideline his whole career. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, the <ORGANIZATION>Rams</ORGANIZATION> gained 411 yards, made seven of 11 third-down tries, held the 
ball for 36:38 and gained an average of 6.5 yards each offensive play. They ran 
for 150 yards to set up the pass. They passed to score. And their defense had 
to hold on. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the kind of offense we think we are," <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> said, "or thought we 
were going into this season. We have been sporadic offensively, and after that 
first fumble, we executed things pretty darn well today. That's kind of what we 
anticipated our team being. We're pretty hard to stop when we get that kind of 
a thing going." 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland started the day in proper fashion when punt returner <PERSON>Brian Brennan</PERSON> 
muffed <PERSON>Keith English</PERSON>'s short punt right into the hands of Ram safety <PERSON>Pat 
Terrell</PERSON>. But <PERSON>Gary</PERSON> fumbled right after that, and thoughts of a true football 
Titanic were in order. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams capitalized on a big <PERSON>Darryl Henley</PERSON> punt return with a 30-yard <PERSON>Mike 
Lansford</PERSON> field goal and a 3-0 lead. Cleveland tied it on the next possession, 
but then the Rams revved up the engine. 
</P>
<P>
Tight end <PERSON>Pete Holohan</PERSON> scored the first touchdown on a fourth-and-goal 
touchdown pass from <LOCATION>Everett</LOCATION> inches from the goal line to culminate a 12-play, 
65-yard drive. It was <PERSON>Everett</PERSON>'s first touchdown pass in four games, and after a 
tough goal-line stand, the play seemed to deflate an already rattled <PERSON>Brown</PERSON> 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
Green capped the second drive with an easy 16-yard scoring reception when 
nobody covered him in the right flat. Ram running backs, who caught eight 
passes and scored on three of them, seemed to be open every time Everett wanted 
them to be. The <PERSON>Browns</PERSON>' linebackers blitzed a lot to try to stir up the 
intensity, but that simply made it easier for the backs to get open. 
</P>
<P>
"We just have to be thankful we have a chance to go play again," <PERSON>Brown</PERSON> Interim 
Coach <PERSON>Jim Shofner</PERSON> said. "We have a chance to play somebody and play better than 
we played. That's the only way you can look at it." 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>Rams</ORGANIZATION>' defense began to find out why <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION> offense has struggled all 
season long. Linebacker <PERSON>Kevin Greene</PERSON>, who had three sacks, stormed in on <PERSON>Brown</PERSON> 
quarterback <PERSON>Bernie Kosar</PERSON> on consecutive plays in the <DATE>second quarter</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had about four or five three-sack days," <PERSON>Greene</PERSON> said. "When I feel right, 
they start to come." 
</P>
<P>
On the first one, he hit <PERSON>Kosar</PERSON> clean from the blind side, popping the ball 
loose. It wasn't ruled a fumble, but it set the tone. 
</P>
<P>
On the <ORGANIZATION>Rams</ORGANIZATION>' first possession of the second half, they nearly put the game away 
with an eight-play, 67-yard touchdown drive straight through the <PERSON>Browns</PERSON>' 
defense. Everett was four for five, and at one point hit on three consecutive 
passes for 15, 18 and 15 yards. The last two were to receiver <PERSON>Henry Ellard</PERSON>, 
pushing him past <ORGANIZATION>Hall of Famer Tom Fears</ORGANIZATION> and making him the <ORGANIZATION>Rams</ORGANIZATION>' all-time 
receptor with 401 career catches. Ellard finished with six catches and 402 in 
his career. 
</P>
<P>
As the crowd of 61,981 murmured its obvious disapproval with the 24-3 score, 
the <PERSON>Browns</PERSON> showed a little life by scoring a touchdown on their next drive. But 
the resurgence was temporary. 
</P>
<P>
Everett found <PERSON>Robert Delpino</PERSON> drifting free down the left side of the field for 
a 21-yard touchdown and a 31-10 Ram lead a few minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
That's when the "Jump Art/2-14" balloon floated around the stadium in front of 
much-loathed <PERSON>Brown</PERSON> owner Art <ORGANIZATION>Modell</ORGANIZATION>'s box, and the message got the most rousing 
response of the windy day. 
</P>
<P>
A seven-play, 70-yard drive, resulting in a three-yard dump pass from <PERSON>Kosar</PERSON> to 
fullback <PERSON>Kevin Mack</PERSON>, cut the lead. But The <ORGANIZATION>Rams</ORGANIZATION> came back with one last 
touchdown, <PERSON>Everett</PERSON> throwing his fourth of the day, 10 yards to <PERSON>McGee</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>Rams</ORGANIZATION> will play the Saints <DATE>Sunday</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
"I think <LOCATION>New Orleans</LOCATION> is a very good team, had a start something like ours and 
now is rolling along pretty good," <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> said. "I think that's going to be a 
big game." 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Rams deactivated tight end <PERSON>Damone Johnson</PERSON> and receiver <PERSON>Aaron Cox</PERSON>, both of 
whom have hamstring injuries. <PERSON>Pat Carter</PERSON> started in <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON>'s place and running 
back <PERSON>Robert Delpino</PERSON> often was used as the team's third wideout. . . . Ram 
injuries listed: cornerback <PERSON>Bobby Humphery</PERSON> (lower back) and safety <PERSON>Michael 
Stewart</PERSON> (concussion). 
</P>
<P>

Don't expect Ram quarterback <PERSON>Jim Everett</PERSON> to emulate <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION> quarterback 
<PERSON>Bernie Kosar</PERSON>, who went into a tirade <DATE>Sunday</DATE> after the <PERSON>Browns</PERSON>' sixth consecutive 
loss. Kosar criticized his teammates for lack of concentration, and this week 
said the Browns appear to have benefited from the lashing as they head into 
this <DATE>Sunday</DATE>'s game against the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure it was out of frustration; I'm sure it's one way he wants to try to 
motivate his troops," <PERSON>Everett</PERSON> said. "They've had a coaching change, and the 
leadership probably is not there, so he's probably trying to take it upon 
himself." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm fortunate that we have some team leaders that are very solid individuals 
here, who through thick and thin make the difference." 
</P>
<P>
Coach <PERSON>John Robinson</PERSON>, while straining to make it clear he wasn't specifically 
talking about <PERSON>Kosar</PERSON>'s action, said he would never want an individual player 
taking his teammates to task in the media. 
</P>
<P>
"I think you feel betrayed when somebody does something like that, when in 
essence it's behind your back, it's to the press," <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> also held an on-field meeting to make sure the Rams don't have a 
letdown <DATE>Sunday</DATE> against the <ORGANIZATION>Cleveland Browns</ORGANIZATION> (2-9) after upsetting the <LOCATION>San

his 96th catch. Four players have caught 100 in a season.  </CAPTION>
<DESCRIPT>  PROFESSIONAL; FOOTBALL; GAME; RESULT  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  It's the question the Houston Oilers have been eager to answer since Coach
Jack Pardee installed the run-and-shoot.;   "Everybody says, 'What can they do
when they need to win? How will they do in bad weather?' " quarterback Warren
Moon said Sunday.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  OILERS PROVE SLICK IN NASTY WEATHER  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  The NFL/Week 16; Roundup  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     "We reacted pretty well to that today.";   <PERSON>Moon</PERSON> drove the Oilers 82 yards
through a <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION> snowstorm to the winning touchdown with two minutes left
as <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION> beat the <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION> Browns 17-14. The loss mathematically eliminated
<LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION> (6-9) from playoff possibilities. Houston (11-4) matched a team
record for wins and kept alive its hope for a first-round bye.;   <PERSON>Moon</PERSON>
completed six passes on the winning drive and in the process set a
single-season <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> record for completions. His 2-yard touchdown pass to <PERSON>Haywood
Jeffires</PERSON> with 2 minutes, 19 seconds to play gave the Oilers their first and
only lead. It was <PERSON>Moon</PERSON>'s 382nd completion this season, surpassing the mark of
378 set by <PERSON>Dan Marino</PERSON> in <DATE>1986.</DATE>;   The run-and-shoot is a proven offense
indoors, but doubters say it can't be relied upon when snow, wind and cold are
added to the mix.;   Though <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION> had trouble getting into the end zone, it
moved the ball well despite 29-degree cold and occasionally heavy snow --
particularly when it mattered most. Moon completed 26 of 40 passes for 250
yards and overcame an interception that killed a <DATE>fourth-quarter</DATE> drive.;  
"It's just a matter of making the big plays when you have to, regardless of
the weather," <PERSON>Moon</PERSON> said. "Coach <PERSON>Pardee</PERSON> said we had to go into this game not
making an issue of the weather. We've made some big drives before, although
this was maybe under worse conditions.";   The conditions became the <ORGANIZATION>Oilers</ORGANIZATION>'
ally at the end. After <PERSON>Bernie Kosar</PERSON> took the Browns to the <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION> 1-yard line
with four seconds left, <PERSON>Matt Stover</PERSON> hooked a 19-yard field-goal attempt wide
of the left upright.;   "I think I may have slipped a little bit, but it
wasn't enough to make me miss a field goal," <PERSON>Stover</PERSON> said. "I felt it was,
like, solid. There are no excuses."; VIKINGS 20, RAMS 14: <PERSON>Reggie Rutland</PERSON>'s
97-yard interception return led <LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION> (8-7) to a victory over <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>
in <LOCATION>Minneapolis</LOCATION>, but the Vikings were eliminated from playoff contention
because of victories by <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> and Dallas.;   <LOCATION>Rutland</LOCATION>'s franchise-record
interception return added to the Vikings' 13-7 lead. The <ORGANIZATION>Rams</ORGANIZATION> had driven to
<LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION>'s 9-yard line when <LOCATION>Rutland</LOCATION> stepped in front of receiver <PERSON>Henry Ellard</PERSON>
at the 3, picked off the pass and was escorted along the sideline, past the
<ORGANIZATION>Rams</ORGANIZATION>' bench, by <PERSON>Audray McMillian</PERSON> for the touchdown.;   "The receiver tried to
lure me inside, then broke outside," <LOCATION>Rutland</LOCATION> said. "(Rams quarterback <PERSON>Jim
Everett</PERSON>) pretty much threw it on rhythm, without looking. . . . I anticipated
the route and got inside him. I was between the passer and receiver, and no
matter where he threw it, I would have had it.";   <ORGANIZATION>The Rams</ORGANIZATION>' loss was their
ninth straight, the most for the franchise in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>. The 1937-38
<ORGANIZATION>Cleveland Rams</ORGANIZATION> lost 12 in a row.;   "We're going through a hard time," said
<PERSON>Everett</PERSON>, who had four interceptions and a fumble. "It's <DATE>Week 15</DATE>, and we're
still making Week 5 mistakes."; PATRIOTS 6, JETS 3: <LOCATION>New England</LOCATION> used two field
goals by <PERSON>Charlie Baumann</PERSON> to beat <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>East Rutherford</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>, nearly
ending the Jets' playoff hopes. But <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>'s victory over <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> kept the
Jets, who have lost three straight, still in the AFC wild-card hunt.;   The
Jets (7-8), losing their third game in a row, missed two short field goals,
and quarterback <PERSON>Ken O'Brien</PERSON>'s passes often sailed in gusts of up to 30 mph.;  
"I don't know if the pressure got to us or what," <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Brad Baxter</PERSON> said.
"We had the ball and we had the opportunities. Somebody has to make a big
play.";   Nobody did for the Jets. And <LOCATION>New England</LOCATION>, 1-15 last year, moved to
6-9 in its first season under Coach <PERSON>Dick MacPherson.</PERSON>; REDSKINS 34, GIANTS 17:
<PERSON>Mark Rypien</PERSON> passed for three touchdowns and <ORGANIZATION>NFC East</ORGANIZATION> champion <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>
pushed its record to 14-1 with a wipeout of the defending Super Bowl champions
in <LOCATION>Washington.</LOCATION>;   <PERSON>Gary Clark</PERSON>'s 65-yard TD catch started the rout for the
Redskins, who opened a 24-10 halftime lead.;   Fears that the Redskins might
be complacent seemed unfounded. "I was really proud of our guys, because they
had a good attitude," Redskins Coach <PERSON>Joe Gibbs</PERSON> said. "They have a tremendous
amount of respect for the <ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION>, and they played them hard.";   The victory
marked the first time since <DATE>1983</DATE> that the Redskins had swept their season
series against <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> (7-8).;   <PERSON>Rypien</PERSON> completed 9 of 19 passes for 230
yards and three touchdowns before leaving the game in the fourth period with a
torn fingernail on his passing hand.; BILLS 35, COLTS 7: <PERSON>Kenneth Davis</PERSON>,
playing for the injured <PERSON>Thurman Thomas</PERSON>, rushed for 90 yards and one touchdown
and caught one of three touchdown passes by <PERSON>Jim Kelly</PERSON> as <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> (13-2) won in
<LOCATION>Indianapolis</LOCATION> and clinched the home-field advantage throughout the AFC
playoffs.;   <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> scored on its first three possessions and set club season
records for points (444), passing yardage (3,747) and total offense (6,168
yards).;   The only consolation for <LOCATION>Indianapolis</LOCATION> (1-14), which matched a
franchise record for the most losses in one season, was the guarantee of the
No. 1 pick in next <DATE>spring</DATE>'s college draft as the worst team in the NFL.;   The
only touchdown for the Colts was on a 1-yard run by <PERSON>Tim Manoa</PERSON> early in the
<DATE>fourth quarter</DATE>. Manoa started in place of <PERSON>Eric Dickerson</PERSON>, out with the flu,
and set up his first TD of the season with a 44-yard run, the <ORGANIZATION>Colts</ORGANIZATION>' longest
rush in two years.;   <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON>, who went in as the <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION>'s leading rusher this
season, sprained his left ankle on his sixth carry of the game's first
series.; STEELERS 17, BENGALS 10: <PERSON>Bubby Brister</PERSON> threw touchdown passes to
rookie tight ends <PERSON>Adrian Cooper</PERSON> and <PERSON>Keith Cash</PERSON> as host <LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION> (6-9)
withstood five turnovers to beat Cincinnati.;   The loss assured the Bengals
(2-13) of the worst season in the franchise's 24-year history.;   The 17
points allowed were the fewest by an <ORGANIZATION>NFL-worst Bengals</ORGANIZATION> defense that has
allowed 30 or more points nine times. The <ORGANIZATION>Steelers</ORGANIZATION>, who earlier won in
<LOCATION>Cincinnati</LOCATION> 33-27 in overtime, swept the Bengals in the season series for the
first time since <DATE>1987</DATE>.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>
   Contrary to rumor, there will be a Super Bowl in late <DATE>January</DATE>, and it probably will not involve players who have lately been employed as bartenders or repo men. 
However, some difficulty is being experienced in finding teams willing to participate in the thing. 

   Thanksgiving has scarcely been digested, but already the <ORGANIZATION>New York Giants</ORGANIZATION>, last season's version of the Greatest Team Ever, are dead, no doubt the victims of collective writer's cramp from their postchampionship biography blitz. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Chicago Bears</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>GTE</ORGANIZATION> of 1985-86, are winning, but are finding that a good offense isn't necessarily the best defense. 

   The <ORGANIZATION>National Football League</ORGANIZATION>'s old lions -- the <ORGANIZATION>Steelers</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Dolphins</LOCATION>, Cowboys and Raiders -- need tooth transplants -- and the new lions -- the <LOCATION>Seahawks</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Saints</LOCATION>, Colts and Chargers -- haven't claimed enough significant prey to roar convincingly yet. 
The real Lions, of <LOCATION>Motor City</LOCATION> residence, are gastly, as usual, of course. 

   One outfit, though, appears willing and able to entertain Super Bowl aspirations, or whoever else shows up. 
The <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> 49ers, the <ORGANIZATION>GTE</ORGANIZATION> of <DATE>1982</DATE> and <DATE>'85</DATE>, sliced, diced and pureed the <LOCATION>Cleveland Browns</LOCATION> here <DATE>Sunday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> to at least stamp themselves as the <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION>'s team of the moment. 
For the statistical minded, the final score was 38-24. 

   The <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION>'s determination to count the three strike-breaker games of unhappy <DATE>October</DATE> memory have made records and stats shaky things in this campaign, a stew of different and slightly malodorous ingredients. 
But since the show is going on, I guess we're stuck with 'em. 
The win put the <ORGANIZATION>Niners</ORGANIZATION>' won-lost mark at 9-2 (6-2 for their "real" team), the best in the <ORGANIZATION>NFC West</ORGANIZATION> division, and dropped the <PERSON>Browns</PERSON>' to 7-4 (5-3), still the best in the AFC Central. 
Just as important to the ultimate title picture, it was achieved at the expense of the league's best defense, at least as measured by the numbers the <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> is passing around. 

   The <PERSON>Browns</PERSON>' "D," which stands for both defense and their defensive unit's "Dogs" nickname, had given up the league's fewest yards and points going in. 
But it was made to jump through hoops <DATE>Sunday</DATE> by <PERSON>Joe Montana</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>Niners</ORGANIZATION>' magician of a quarterback. 
Now there's a man for all seasons, no matter what their pedigree. 

   <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>, you'll remember, led <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> to its <DATE>1982</DATE> and '85 Super Bowl wins, and might have done the same in <DATE>January</DATE> if he hadn't missed eight games with back surgery and seen stars early on in a playoff loss to the <ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION>. 
Slim of build but quick of brain and foot, he is, arguably, the GQE, which stands for Greatest Quarterback Ever, although that's another subject. 

   On <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, before about 60,000 home fans at <LOCATION>Candlestick Park</LOCATION> in better weather than the baseball Giants usually get, he completed 23 of 31 passes for 342 yards and four touchdowns. 
He also ran for 43 yards that counted and, generally, ran the Browns defense ragged. 

   "We chased him, but we couldn't slow him down. 
He made it obvious why so many rank him the best quarterback around," said <PERSON>Browns</PERSON> coach <PERSON>Marty Schottenheimer</PERSON> afterward. 

   Browns cornerback <PERSON>Hanford Dixon</PERSON>, a victim of multiple burns on <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, was equally generous in praising his adversary. 
"That was the best I've seen a quarterback play, ever," he said. 
"It was not a Dog Day Afternoon tonight." 
Montana tamed the Browns by keeping them off balance. 
His main target was <PERSON>Jerry Rice</PERSON>, a sleek third-year man from little <ORGANIZATION>Mississippi Valley State College</ORGANIZATION>, who caught three touchdown passes <DATE>Sunday</DATE> on top of three the week before against <LOCATION>Tampa Bay</LOCATION>. 
When the <PERSON>Browns</PERSON> became too intent on stopping <PERSON>Rice</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> threw short to backs <PERSON>Tom Rathman</PERSON> and <PERSON>Roger Craig</PERSON> or tight end <PERSON>John Frank</PERSON>. 

   Rice's TD catches were of two, 30 and 29 yards, and on each he reached the end zone untouched. 
Among other things, the extraordinary effort earned him some peace and quiet on the field. 
"In the beginning, the <PERSON>Browns</PERSON> were sayin' things to me, like how they were going to shut me down. 
But after I caught a few they got quiet," he related. 
"One of 'em even told me I was a hell of a player," he added with some amazement. 

   Fullback <PERSON>Rathman</PERSON> paid a similar compliment to teammate <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>. 
"It's hard to drop a pass that's right in your hands, and that's where all of <PERSON>Joe</PERSON>'s were tonight," said he. 

   "What's amazing about <PERSON>Joe</PERSON> is that he almost always makes the right choice," offered halfback <PERSON>Craig</PERSON>. 
"You'll sometimes come back to the huddle thinking 'Why didn't he throw to me? -- I was open.' 
But on the film you'll see he threw to a guy who was more open." 

   <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION> counterpart, <PERSON>Bernie Kosar</PERSON>, also found a few receivers open on the Candlestick greensward <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, and for awhile he helped his mates make a game of it. 
Down 21-10 with just 2:39 left in the first half, he hit six of seven passes in an especially nice drive that pulled the Browns to within four at the break. 

   The second half was all San Fran, though. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Niners</ORGANIZATION> got a 38-yard field goal from <PERSON>Ray Wersching</PERSON> in the <DATE>third quarter</DATE> and a touchdown that made the score 31-17 early in quarter four on <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>'s 29-yarder to Rice. 
On their next possession, the <PERSON>Browns</PERSON> felt forced to go for it on fourth-down-and-one from their own 44 yard line, but linebacker <PERSON>Keena Turner</PERSON> stopped <LOCATION>Earnest</LOCATION> Byner for no gain. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Niners</ORGANIZATION> put it away by responding with a rushing touchdown, of all things. 

   The loss, of course, doesn't put the Browns out of the chase. 
This is a gang that led last season's AFC championship game until the last 37 seconds against <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION>, and that possesses the kind of run-pass balance on offense that teams without a <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> need. 

   "I have a feeling we'll see these guys again, and when we do we'll be readier to stop <PERSON>Joe</PERSON>," said the plucky <PERSON>Dixon</PERSON>. 
"Hey, anything we do in a rematch has got to be better than tonight."

<LEADPARA>  It's hard to say which was more surprising: that the Cincinnati Bengals
finally won, or the way they did it.;   Matt Stover, perfect on his previous
10 field-goal attempts, missed a try when the ball hit the left upright with 1
minute, 56 seconds to play. Then, sure-handed Brian Brennan dropped a
touchdown pass. Finally, Eric Thomas blocked Stover's 34-yard attempt with
time running out to preserve a 23-21 victory over the Cleveland Browns (4-5)
on Sunday.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The Bengals (1-8) celebrated as if they had clinched a playoff spot.;  
"Unbelievable!" offensive tackle <PERSON>Anthony Munoz</PERSON> said. "To get a win, no matter
how . . . this was a great one today.";   <PERSON>Kevin Mack</PERSON>, who scored all three
<LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION> touchdowns, fumbled the ball away at the Bengals' 16 with five
minutes left. Then <PERSON>Stover</PERSON> hit the upright on a 47-yarder.;   "I hit it great,"
<PERSON>Stover</PERSON> said. "I wouldn't take anything back except to have it go through. It
hit way up on the upright -- it could have gone through from 60. There was a
wind blowing from right to left. The ball just hooked a little bit to the
left.";   The Bengals nearly celebrated too early. After three plays and a
punt, <PERSON>Bernie Kosar</PERSON> drove the Browns to the 17. Brennan then got open in the
corner of the end zone, but <PERSON>Kosar</PERSON>'s perfect pass bounced off <PERSON>Brennan</PERSON>'s
shoulder with seven seconds left.;   "I just dropped the ball," <PERSON>Brennan</PERSON> said.;
  "I couldn't believe he dropped it," <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON> said. "We've had so much bad
luck, we were overdue for good luck.";   <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON> delivered it on the next play,
sprinting in from the right side to block <PERSON>Stover</PERSON>'s attempt harmlessly away.;  
<LOCATION>Cincinnati</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Boomer Esiason</PERSON>, who sat out the previous game with a shoulder
injury, threw a 2-yard TD pass to <PERSON>Mike Dingle</PERSON> and a 34-yarder to <PERSON>Eddie Brown</PERSON>.
<PERSON>Harold Green</PERSON> ran 24 times for 135 yards.;   <PERSON>Kosar</PERSON> completed 19 of 31 passes
for 285 yards, leaving him one pass shy of <PERSON>Bart Starr</PERSON>'s NFL-record 294 passes
without an interception.;   "The records are nice when you get a lot older,"
<PERSON>Kosar</PERSON> said, "but right now I don't take much consolation in that."; BENGALS

<P>
The New England Patriots set some standards they probably would have wanted to 
avoid in their 37-7 loss to the <LOCATION>Kansas City Chiefs</LOCATION>. The Patriots set a team 
record with their 10th consecutive defeat, a feat performed in front of the 
smallest crowd in the <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> so far this season. The attendance of 26,280 undercut 
the previous low of 28,924 for the <ORGANIZATION>Indianapolis Colts</ORGANIZATION>' game at <ORGANIZATION>New England Nov</ORGANIZATION>. 
11. <LOCATION>Kansas City</LOCATION> also set an <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> record with its sixth blocked punt. The victory 
was <LOCATION>Kansas City</LOCATION>'s fourth in its past five games. <PERSON>Stephone Paige</PERSON> scored on an 
86-yard pass play from <PERSON>Steve DeBerg</PERSON> on the Chiefs' first play from scrimmage. 
It was <PERSON>Paige</PERSON>'s longest reception in his eight-year career. 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>Cincinnati Bengals</ORGANIZATION>' 16-12 victory over <LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION> denied Steeler Coach 
<PERSON>Chuck Noll</PERSON> his 200th regular-season victory in 22 seasons. It was <LOCATION>Cincinnati</LOCATION>'s 
sixth consecutive victory over <LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> Bills sacked <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> quarterback <PERSON>Randall Cunningham</PERSON> six times 
in a 30-23 victory, ending the <ORGANIZATION>Eagles</ORGANIZATION>' winning streak at five games. <PERSON>Jim Kelly</PERSON>, 
with 334 yards passing, had his first 300-yard passing day of the season. <PERSON>James 
Lofton</PERSON> caught five of his passes for 174 yards to move into third place on the 
all-time receiving yardage list with 11,889, passing <PERSON>Don Maynard</PERSON>. Cunningham 
threw the <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION>'s longest touchdown of the season, a 95-yarder to <PERSON>Fred Barnett</PERSON>, 
but the Bills' heavy pass rush kept him from bringing <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> back. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Jim Everett</PERSON> ended a string of three games without a touchdown with four 
touchdown passes in the <ORGANIZATION>Rams</ORGANIZATION>' 38-23 victory over the <LOCATION>Cleveland Browns</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Henry 
Ellard</PERSON> led Ram receivers with six catches for 90 yards, giving him a 
team-record 402 receptions. He broke <PERSON>Tom Fears</PERSON>' record of 400. The loss was 
<LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION>'s sixth in a row at home, a team record. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Vinny Testaverde</PERSON> passed for 351 yards in the <LOCATION>Tampa Bay Buccaneers</LOCATION><DATE>' 23-17</DATE> 
victory over <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>, handing the Falcons their fifth consecutive defeat and 
their 17th consecutive loss on the road. The victory ended the <ORGANIZATION>Buccaneers</ORGANIZATION>' 
six-game losing streak. <PERSON>Willie Drewrey</PERSON>'s 89-yard touchdown reception from 
<PERSON>Testaverde</PERSON> was the longest in <LOCATION>Tampa Bay</LOCATION> history, breaking the record of 84 
yards from <PERSON>Doug Williams</PERSON> to <ORGANIZATION>Kevin House</ORGANIZATION> against <LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION> in <DATE>1981</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Kevin Butler</PERSON>'s field goal with 33 seconds remaining in the <DATE>fourth quarter</DATE> 
against <LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION> was the 128th of career and tied him for the team record with 
<PERSON>Bob Thomas</PERSON>. <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> quarterback <PERSON>Jim Harbaugh</PERSON> has thrown 146 consecutive passes 
without an interception. 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>'s Art Monk caught 10 passes in the Redskins' victory over <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>, 
giving him 112 consecutive games with at least one reception. <PERSON>Gary Clark</PERSON> caught 
three passes to give him 402 receptions in six <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> seasons. 
</P>
<P>
With three receptions for 25 yards against <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New Orleans</LOCATION> wide receiver 
<PERSON>Eric Martin</PERSON> became the <ORGANIZATION>Saints</ORGANIZATION>' all-time leader in receiving yards. He has 321 
receptions for 4,890 yards, breaking the record of 4,875 yards in 309 
receptions set by <PERSON>Danny Abramowicz</PERSON>. Saint kicker <PERSON>Morten Anderson</PERSON> has scored in 
106 consecutive games. He kicked field goals of 43 and 50 yards and had one 
extra point. 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Marion Butts</PERSON> gained 159 yards in 26 carries against the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> 
Jets to become the seventh player in Charger history to rush for more than 
1,000 yard in a season. He has 1,154 yards this year. 
</P>
<P>
Norm <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON>'s 42-yard field goal in overtime gave <LOCATION>Seattle</LOCATION> a 13-10 victory over 
the <ORGANIZATION>Houston Oilers</ORGANIZATION>. It was the fourth time the Seahawks had their game decided 
on the final play. They've won three of them, including a 13-10 victory at <LOCATION>San 
Diego</LOCATION> <DATE>last Sunday</DATE> on <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON>'s 40-yard field goal in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
ROLE REVERSALS 
</P>
<P>
Before <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, the <LOCATION>Miami Dolphins</LOCATION> had the leading defense in the <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION>; the 
<LOCATION>Cincinnati</LOCATION> Bengals' defense was No. 26 in the league. Chances are they'll be 
ranked a little closer this week. Earnest Byner ran for 157 yards and three 
touchdowns and the <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> Redskins riddled the Dolphins for 467 total yards 
in a 42-20 victory. The Redskins, who had three consecutive long scoring drives 
to take a 21-0 lead, had 222 rushing yards against a defense that had been 
giving up only 85 a game. Byner became the first player to rush for more 100 
yards against the Dolphins. Redskin quarterback <PERSON>Mark Rypien</PERSON> almost doubled the 
<LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> season total for passing touchdowns allowed. Rypien threw three touchdown 
passes; the Dolphins had only given up four and had not allowed a touchdown 
through the air in five games. 
</P>
<P>
At <LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Steelers</ORGANIZATION> made the Bengals look their best, again. The 
<ORGANIZATION>Steelers</ORGANIZATION> had apparently righted their early-season offensive problems more than 
a month ago with one-sided victories over the <ORGANIZATION>Rams</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Atlanta Falcons</LOCATION>. Then 
they played the Bengals and were held without a touchdown in a 27-3 loss. The 
next week, the <ORGANIZATION>Steelers</ORGANIZATION> got back on track with a 24-7 victory over the Jets 
before <DATE>Sunday</DATE>'s rematch with the Bengals. <LOCATION>Cincinnati</LOCATION> prevented a touchdown 
again with a 16-12 victory. The <ORGANIZATION>Steelers</ORGANIZATION> haven't scored a touchdown against the 
Bengals in 11 quarters. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
INJURIES 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> quarterback <PERSON>Chris Miller</PERSON> suffered a broken right clavicle in the <DATE>third 
quarter</DATE> against <LOCATION>New Orleans</LOCATION> and probably will not be able to throw for four or 
five months, <ORGANIZATION>Falcon</ORGANIZATION> Coach <PERSON>Jerry Glanville</PERSON> said. . . . <LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION> tackle <PERSON>Tunch 
Ilkin</PERSON>, sidelined for a month with a dislocated elbow, left in the <DATE>third quarter</DATE> 
against <LOCATION>Cincinnati</LOCATION> with a bruised back. . . . <LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION> cornerback <PERSON>Bruce McNorton</PERSON> 
suffered a broken left arm in the first half against <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>. . . . <LOCATION>Phoenix</LOCATION> 
running back <PERSON>Johnny Johnson</PERSON> left the game against <LOCATION>Indianapolis</LOCATION> in the <DATE>second 
quarter</DATE> after aggravating a twisted right ankle. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE <ORGANIZATION>BRADSHAW FACTOR 
</P>
<P>
Former Pittsburgh Steeler</ORGANIZATION> quarterback <PERSON>Terry Bradshaw</PERSON> minced no words on "The 
NFL Today" on <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION> before the Rams played the Browns at <LOCATION>Cleveland Stadium</LOCATION>. 
Bradshaw questioned the wisdom of <PERSON>Bernie Kosar</PERSON>'s complaining about the 
dedication of his teammates and the <PERSON>Browns</PERSON>' management after <DATE>last Sunday</DATE>'s 
30-13 loss to the <LOCATION>Miami Dolphins</LOCATION>. Bradshaw indicated he believed a player in a 
leadership position who takes a tack such as <PERSON>Kosar</PERSON>'s could have a more 
detrimental effect on a team than help it, and he predicted a blowout victory 
for the <ORGANIZATION>Rams</ORGANIZATION>, who handed the Browns their seventh consecutive defeat, 38-23. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
EASY MARK 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>Kansas City</LOCATION> linebacker <PERSON>Derrick Thomas</PERSON>, who began the day with a league-leading 
15 sacks, didn't play in the <ORGANIZATION>Chiefs</ORGANIZATION>' 37-7 victory over the <LOCATION>New England Patriots</LOCATION> 
at <LOCATION>Foxboro</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass</LOCATION>. He rested a knee he injured <DATE>last Sunday</DATE> in a 27-24 victory 
over the <ORGANIZATION>Raiders</ORGANIZATION>. Apparently, the <ORGANIZATION>Chiefs</ORGANIZATION> didn't miss <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON>' contributions. 
Despite his absence, the Chiefs applied pressure on <LOCATION>New England</LOCATION> quarterback 
<PERSON>Tommy Hodson</PERSON> all day and sacked him six times. They lead the league with 42 
sacks this season. Defensive ends <PERSON>Bill Maas</PERSON> and <PERSON>Neil Smith</PERSON> had two sacks each. 
Hodson completed 20 of 39 passes for 211 yards, but he also had two passes 
intercepted. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
IN <LOCATION>QUOTES 
</P>
<P>
New England</LOCATION> Coach <PERSON>Ron Rust</PERSON>, after the <ORGANIZATION>Patriot</ORGANIZATION>'s team-record 10th loss in a row, 
37-7 to the <LOCATION>Kansas City Chiefs</LOCATION>, was asked if his team had reached its low-water 
mark of the season: "I hope it is. I thought we hit it a long time ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Chief quarterback <PERSON>Steve DeBerg</PERSON>, who passed for 312 yards in the first two 
quarters against the Patriots: "That's as well as I've ever seen an offense 
function for a full half." 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Seth Joyner</PERSON>, who intercepted a pass late in the 30-23 loss to 
<LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> then fumbled the <ORGANIZATION>Eagles</ORGANIZATION>' chances away when he tried to lateral the ball 
to a teammate: "We're an opportunistic defense, an opportunistic team. We live 
by the sword and we die by the sword. Today, it didn't work for us."

 <LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Bubby Brister</PERSON>, after a 16-12 loss to <LOCATION>Cincinnati</LOCATION> gave the Bengals 
a one-game lead over <LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION> in the AFC Central: "It's not over. If we win 
the rest of our games, we're 10-6 and that might be good enough to win the 
division. But everybody's angry: I'm angry, <PERSON>Chuck</PERSON>'s (<PERSON>Noll</PERSON>) angry, the whole 
team's angry. We had too many opportunities to win."

 Seattle kicker <PERSON>Norm Johnson</PERSON>, after his field goal in overtime gave the

Chicago Coach <PERSON>Mike Ditka</PERSON>'s decision in overtime first looked like a blunder, 
then turned out fine in the Bears' <DATE>23-17</DATE> victory over the <LOCATION>Detroit Lions</LOCATION>. The 
Bears, who had tied the score, 17-17, on <PERSON>Kevin Butler</PERSON>'s 19-yard field goal with 
33 seconds left in the <DATE>fourth quarter</DATE>, decided to defend the north goal and get 
a strong wind at their back. The Lions drove to the <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> 17-yard line. <PERSON>Eddie 
Murray</PERSON> made a genius of <PERSON>Ditka</PERSON> and missed a field-goal attempt from 35 yards. 
The Bears then picked up three first downs before <PERSON>Jim Harbaugh</PERSON> and <PERSON>Neal 
Anderson</PERSON> connected on a 50-yard pass play for a touchdown and the victory. Said 
<PERSON>Ditka</PERSON>: "This isn't good for my health. We were fortunate, and sometimes in life

RIVALRY REBORN 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Troy Aikman</PERSON> and <PERSON>Steve Walsh</PERSON>, former first-round draft picks who battled for a 
starting position with the <ORGANIZATION>Dallas Cowboys</ORGANIZATION>, went head to head as opposing 
quarterbacks. The <ORGANIZATION>Cowboys</ORGANIZATION>' <PERSON>Aikman</PERSON> and <PERSON>Walsh</PERSON>, traded to the <LOCATION>New Orleans</LOCATION> <DATE>Saints 
two months ago</DATE>, were nearly identical statistically, but <PERSON>Aikman</PERSON> prevailed in a 
17-13 victory. He directed the Cowboys on two 80-yard touchdown drives in the 
<DATE>second half</DATE>. "Troy was just excellent," said <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> Coach <PERSON>Jimmy Johnson</PERSON>. "Troy 
made some great plays . . . and, for the first time in 14 games, had no 
interceptions." 
</P>
<P>
Walsh completed 18 of 27 passes for 177 yards and no touchdowns; <PERSON>Aikman</PERSON> 
completed 15 of 21 for 177 yards and one touchdown. There were no 
interceptions.

THE EASY WAY 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>Chicago Bears</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> 49ers clinched their division championships 
<DATE>Sunday</DATE> off the field. The 49ers won the <ORGANIZATION>NFC West</ORGANIZATION> title when the New Orleans 
Saints were beaten by the <LOCATION>Dallas Cowboys</LOCATION>. After <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> defeated the <ORGANIZATION>Detroit 
Lions</ORGANIZATION> in an afternoon game, the <LOCATION>Minnesota Vikings defeated Green Bay</LOCATION> at night. 
That victory gave the Bears the <ORGANIZATION>NFC Central</ORGANIZATION> championship.

AS SEASON SORTS OUT WINNERS AND LOSERS, 49ERS STILL NFL'S BEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG LOGAN, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After 10 games, the 28-team <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> field has sorted itself out so neatly that all 
six division races have a clear leader; strengths and weaknesses are 
well-defined; and the teams with enough youth and depth to withstand key 
injuries have come to the fore. The playoff contenders are leaving the 
backstretch, and as <ORGANIZATION>New York Giants</ORGANIZATION> Coach <PERSON>Bill Parcells</PERSON> said, "Now is when 
you've got to start thinking about the stretch run." 
</P>
<P>
That goes for <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> writers, too. Here is one man's analysis of each division and 
the wild-card situation: 
</P>
<P>
* NFC East -- <ORGANIZATION>The Giants</ORGANIZATION> should win it. Think of their 31-10 loss to the <LOCATION>Los 
Angeles Rams</LOCATION> as something comparable to a necessary correction in the stock 
market. It's a 16-game season, and the <ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION> were due for an off game after 
several weeks of peak performance. Parcells is pushing the right buttons, and 
the <LOCATION>Philadelphia Eagles</LOCATION> are two games back and playing poorly on offense. The 
true measure of the <ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION> will come in Weeks <DATE>12-14</DATE> when they play at <LOCATION>San 
Francisco</LOCATION>, home against the <ORGANIZATION>Eagles</ORGANIZATION> and at <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION>. The Rams? They will have a 
tough time winning a divisional playoff game in <DATE>January</DATE> at Giants Stadium -- if 
they get that far. 
</P>
<P>
* NFC Central -- The <PERSON>Minnesota Vikings</PERSON>' pass rush is on a record-setting pace 
with 50 sacks, just 22 short of the <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> record set in <DATE>1984</DATE> by the <ORGANIZATION>Chicago 
Bears</ORGANIZATION>. But they still are muddling around on offense, trying to figure out how 
to use <PERSON>Herschel Walker</PERSON>, and their lone divisional loss was to the Bears. Only 
one of the <ORGANIZATION>Vikings</ORGANIZATION>' six remaining opponents has a losing record, so the Bears 
still have a shot. 
</P>
<P>
* NFC West -- The 49ers easily are the class of the league and have the best 
chance of any team to repeat as Super Bowl champs since the <DATE>1978-79</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>Pittsburgh 
Steelers</ORGANIZATION>. They're determined to prove they can win without former Coach <PERSON>Bill 
Walsh</PERSON>. His successor, <PERSON>George Seifert</PERSON>, has filled those big shoes, if not the 
big ego, admirably. 
</P>
<P>
* NFC wild-card situation -- The Bears-Vikings loser in the <ORGANIZATION>NFC Central</ORGANIZATION> should 
gain one wild-card berth. The <LOCATION>Eagles</LOCATION>, Rams and <ORGANIZATION>New Orlans Saints</ORGANIZATION> will battle 
for the other spot. The Rams have the most talent, but if the Saints complete a 
sweep of the season series with the <ORGANIZATION>Rams</ORGANIZATION> at home in <DATE>Week 12</DATE>, they will be in a 
strong position. 
</P>
<P>
* AFC East -- <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> has a rugged schedule, but the Bills' defense and 
quarterback <PERSON>Jim Kelly</PERSON> are up to it. Week 15 may provide a Super Bowl preview 
when the Bills visit the 49ers. The Dolphins have a soft schedule, but <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> is 
the only team with a winning record that has given up more points than it has 
scored. 
</P>
<P>
* AFC Central -- <PERSON>Bud Carson</PERSON>'s <LOCATION>Cleveland Browns</LOCATION> have the No. 1 defense against 
scoring in the <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION>, and they have fashioned an adequate running game with the 
emergence of rookie running back <PERSON>Eric Metcalf</PERSON>. They are capable of winning the 
division, but it might go down to the final game of the season at <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION>. The 
<ORGANIZATION>Cincinnati Bengals</ORGANIZATION> will struggle to finish above .500. 
</P>
<P>
* AFC West -- The Broncos all but clinched it with a win over the <LOCATION>Kansas City 
Chiefs</LOCATION> for a three-game lead. They will be tough if they earn the home field 
advantage throughout the playoffs, especially since former <ORGANIZATION>Los Angeles Raiders</ORGANIZATION> 
Coach <PERSON>Mike Shanahan</PERSON> is working with quarterback <PERSON>John Elway</PERSON> again. 
</P>
<P>
* AFC wild-card situation -- The second-place finisher between the <PERSON>Browns</PERSON> and 
<ORGANIZATION>Oilers</ORGANIZATION> in the AFC Central will get one spot. The Dolphins have the inside track 
for the other but may stumble in two games with the <LOCATION>Chiefs</LOCATION>. If that happens, 
the Bengals or Raiders could sneak in. 
</P>
<P>
* <ORGANIZATION>NFC</ORGANIZATION> playoffs -- No one will stop the 49ers, but the <ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION> have the best 
chance if they can keep <PERSON>Ottis Anderson</PERSON> and the running game going strong enough 
to set up <PERSON>Phil Simms</PERSON>' passing in the playoffs. The Vikings have the talent but 
seem to lack the chemistry. 
</P>
<P>
* AFC playoffs -- The Bills are the best all-round AFC team, but the 
sentimental choice, the <LOCATION>Browns</LOCATION>, will pull off a couple of playoff upsets to 
reach <LOCATION>New Orleans</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
* Super Bowl -- The preseason choice here hasn't changed: 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
Reports from newspapers in <LOCATION>Raleigh</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.C.</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> that the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> Jets 
have contacted Duke Coach <PERSON>Steve Spurrier</PERSON> as a potential replacement for Coach 
<PERSON>Joe Walton</PERSON> don't necessarily mean the Jets are ready to make a move. After the 
<DATE>1987</DATE> season, they explored the idea of hiring <PERSON>Carl Peterson</PERSON>, who since has 
become the <ORGANIZATION>Chiefs</ORGANIZATION>' president and general manager, but decided against making a 
change. 
</P>
<P>
Under the circumstances, it will be surprising if the Jets don't recognize the 
need for change this time around and if they don't also research the top <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> 
assistants, as well as college coaches. Of course, it would help if they had a 
football man in charge of the search. 
</P>
<P>
No one should question the courage of Jets QB <PERSON>Ken O'Brien</PERSON> because he failed to 
go headfirst into Dolphins safety <PERSON>Louis Oliver</PERSON> at the goal line in one of the 
key plays of a 31-23 loss. If things were going well for the Jets and <PERSON>O'Brien</PERSON>, 
he certainly would have reacted differently. His instinct to avoid the hit 
showed not a lack of toughness, but rather that <PERSON>O'Brien</PERSON> has taken such a 
pounding in a 2-8 season that he is like a fighter bobbing and weaving and 
trying to survive with his back against the ropes. 
</P>
<P>
The search for the "next <PERSON>Lawrence Taylor</PERSON>" is over now that rookie outside 
linebacker <PERSON>Derrick Thomas</PERSON> has arrived with the Chiefs. He's stronger against 
the run than the Bills' <PERSON>Cornelius Bennett</PERSON> and a more consistent pass rusher. 
"He's in that class of player," Pro Bowl safety <PERSON>Deron Cherry</PERSON> said of Thomas. 
"They threw him in the fire from the first day. He had to learn or look bad, 
and he doesn't like to look bad." 
</P>
<P>
Eagles QB <PERSON>Randall Cunningham</PERSON>, whose receivers dropped 11 passes in a 10-3 loss 
to the <LOCATION>Washington Redskins</LOCATION>, heard boos from the <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> crowd, which is no 
surprise. "The fans are used to seeing a high-powered offense," <PERSON>Cunningham</PERSON> 
said. Hinting he would like to be turned loose to throw more, he added, "I 
can't boo." 
</P>
<P>
Cowboys cornerback <ORGANIZATION>Everson Walls</ORGANIZATION>, a former Pro Bowl player, said Coach <PERSON>Jimmy 
Johnson</PERSON>'s plan to give more playing time to <PERSON>Issiac Holt</PERSON> is the first step 
toward getting rid of Walls. Walls was responsible for giving up a 
<DATE>fourth-quarter</DATE> TD pass in a 24-20 loss to <LOCATION>Phoenix</LOCATION>, and <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> shouted at him 
for talking to his friends on the Cardinals after the game. Said Walls: "He 
embarrassed me. Only college coaches and <PERSON>Mike Ditka</PERSON> do that ... I guess they'll 
Plan B me." 
</P>
<P>
Detroit Lions Coach <PERSON>Wayne Fontes</PERSON> on his 2-8 team's 31-22 upset of the <ORGANIZATION>Green Bay 
Packers</ORGANIZATION>, who held a 31-8 advantage in first downs and out-gained the Lions 432 
yards to 128: "We lost to ... uh ... won against a good football team. I almost 
slipped there. I've gotten used to that word."

CARSON HAS REASON FOR HIRING EX-JET AIDES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG LOGAN, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Returning <DATE>Sunday</DATE> to <ORGANIZATION>Giants Stadium</ORGANIZATION> to stand across the carpet from the 
strangers wearing Jets green is bound to be an odd sensation for <ORGANIZATION>Browns Coach 
Bud Carson</ORGANIZATION> and four ex-Jets assistants. It will be like visiting an old home 
and being surprised at the changes made by the new tenants and maybe even a 
little sad at the thought of what might have been. 
</P>
<P>
Carson and assistant head coach <PERSON>Dan Radakovich</PERSON> left the Jets a year ahead of 
the broom that swept out former Coach <PERSON>Joe Walton</PERSON> and the rest of his staff at 
the end of last season. Without those two to prop up <LOCATION>Walton</LOCATION>, the Jets collapsed 
in a 4-12 heap, while <PERSON>Carson</PERSON> and <PERSON>Radakovich</PERSON> ended their season in the <ORGANIZATION>AFC</ORGANIZATION> 
championship game at <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Walton</PERSON> and most of his '89 assistants scattered on the four winds to 
<LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New England</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Phoenix</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>. Three are out of 
the <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION>. But <PERSON>Carson</PERSON> hired three other coaches who shared the Jets' foxhole with 
him: quarterbacks coach <PERSON>Zeke Bratkowski</PERSON>, defensive coordinator <PERSON>Jim Vechiarella</PERSON> 
and defensive backs coach <PERSON>Mike Faulkiner</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
While <PERSON>Carson</PERSON>'s hirings have been criticized by some as an example of the 
old-boy network in the <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION>, a closer look would show the five ex-Jets now with 
the <PERSON>Browns</PERSON> formed the nucleus of a very talented coaching staff hired by 
<PERSON>Walton</PERSON>. It's not difficult to imagine how much different things might have 
turned out for the Jets if <PERSON>Walton</PERSON> had been dismissed <DATE>two years earlier</DATE> and 
<PERSON>Carson</PERSON> promoted to the head job. 
</P>
<P>
The record shows <PERSON>Walton</PERSON> had three losing seasons (18-30) without <PERSON>Carson</PERSON> and 
<PERSON>Radakovich</PERSON> and a record of 35-27-1 when they were on his staff from 1985-88. 
The arrival of <PERSON>Carson</PERSON> and <PERSON>Radakovich</PERSON> probably saved <PERSON>Walton</PERSON>'s job after he took 
over a team that went to the <ORGANIZATION>AFC</ORGANIZATION> title game following the <DATE>1982</DATE> season and had 
two straight 7-9 years. 
</P>
<P>
"Absolutely, it turned the team around," <PERSON>Radakovich</PERSON> said recently. "We went to 
the playoffs the first two years. But like anywhere else, you run out of 
players or whatever." 
</P>
<P>
The Jets ran out of whatever it is that causes talent and coaching to mix in 
just the right way to produce a winning record. That's the combination <PERSON>Carson</PERSON> 
was trying to put together when he added <PERSON>Bratkowski</PERSON>, <PERSON>Vechiarella</PERSON> and <PERSON>Faulkiner</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not just a case of going out and hiring every guy you like, although a 
lot of people have accused us of that," said <PERSON>Carson</PERSON>, who has 13 assistants. 
"It's chemistry I'm interested in -- whether people work well together and how 
they work together on game day, what they do on the practice field. Are they 
on-field coaches, off-field coaches? That's what I'm interested in." 
</P>
<P>
When he arrived in <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION>, offensive coordinator <PERSON>Marc Trestman</PERSON> already was 
in place. But <PERSON>Carson</PERSON> assumed greater control by firing <PERSON>Trestman</PERSON> and making over 
his staff with a distinct Jets flavor. "Bud interviewed other coaches," 
<PERSON>Radakovich</PERSON> said, "but he thought they were the best people available for the 
job." 
</P>
<P>
Undoubtedly, some strong bonds were formed while they were with the Jets. "Bud, 
Zeke and 'Vech' lived together for about two years in Point Lookout," said 
former Jets quarterback <PERSON>Pat Ryan</PERSON>, who spent some time in the <PERSON>Browns</PERSON>' training 
camp this <DATE>summer</DATE>. "They sat up and talked football plenty of times. They're a 
tight group." 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> coaching fraternity is a small world, and some of the ties that bind 
the ex-Jets go back even further. Carson and <PERSON>Radakovich</PERSON> spent time together 
with the great Steelers of the early '70s, as well as the Rams and Jets. 
Vechiarella coached with <PERSON>Carson</PERSON> for the <ORGANIZATION>Rams</ORGANIZATION>, Chiefs and Jets, and <PERSON>Bratkowski</PERSON> 
and <PERSON>Carson</PERSON> endured a year of 0-8-1 hell under <PERSON>Frank Kush</PERSON> with the Colts in 
<DATE>1982</DATE>. When <PERSON>Walton</PERSON> promoted <PERSON>Faulkiner</PERSON> to defensive backs coach with the Jets, it 
was <PERSON>Carson</PERSON> who served as his mentor. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Faulkiner</PERSON>, who also is an excellent talent scout, offered these sketches of his 
fellow assistants: 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Radakovich</PERSON>: "He doesn't like to admit it because he likes to coach linebackers, 
but the best thing he does is coach the offensive line." Injuries and 
retirement have destroyed the <PERSON>Browns</PERSON>' line, which means "Bad Rad" faces a big 
job. 
</P>
<P>
Bratkowski: "He's very low-key but fundamentally sound. I think you'll see an 
improvement with <PERSON>Bernie Kosar</PERSON>, even though he's been in the playoffs five years 
in a row." 
</P>
<P>
Vechiarella: "He was an excellent defensive coordinator with good schemes at 
<ORGANIZATION>Tulane</ORGANIZATION> with <PERSON>Larry Smith</PERSON>. When <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> went to <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>, he used Vech's defense, 
and it helped him get the <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION> job." 
</P>
<P>
As for himself, <PERSON>Faulkiner</PERSON> knows his strength is in how he relates to people. "I 
was as honest as I could be with guys, but I also had fun with it," said 
<PERSON>Faulkiner</PERSON>, whose needle was extremely sharp and punctured many an ego. 
</P>
<P>
Developing an understanding of each other is vital to the success of a coaching 
staff. During the football season, it's as though they are in a dark bunker 
with their videotapes and chalkboards, emerging into the light only on <DATE>Sunday</DATE> 
afternoons. 
</P>
<P>
Carson's assistants know they are working for an ex-Marine whose emotional ups 
and downs can be difficult to handle. But they accept his style because they 
know he's a brilliant coach who gets results. 
</P>
<P>
"Bud's record speaks for itself," said <PERSON>Faulkiner</PERSON>. "I haven't seen him change as 
a head coach. He has the title, but he's the same Bud." 
</P>
<P>
In 17 previous <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> seasons, <PERSON>Carson</PERSON> has been with 12 playoff teams, including 
eight division winners, three teams that reached the Super Bowl and two that 
won it. Although <PERSON>Walton</PERSON> sometimes argued with <PERSON>Carson</PERSON> over which personnel to 
keep in the game, he was smart enough to give him free rein to run the defense. 
</P>
<P>
In some ways, the job <PERSON>Carson</PERSON> did camouflaged the Jets' weaknesses. Faulkiner 
recalls the Jets' 8-7-1 record in <DATE>1988</DATE> when the defense had 45 sacks and 24 
interceptions while starting two rookies and a converted wide receiver in the 
defensive backfield. 
</P>
<P>
"We weren't that good," <PERSON>Faulkiner</PERSON> said. "I think <PERSON>Joe</PERSON> put a lot of pressure on 
himself last year. He thought we were going to win 10 games. We got off to a 
bad start, and things snowballed." 
</P>
<P>
At one point, <PERSON>Faulkiner</PERSON> had an argument with <PERSON>Walton</PERSON> in which the two almost 
came to blows before <PERSON>Faulkiner</PERSON> stalked out. That was a moment he regrets. 
</P>
<P>
"<PERSON>Walton</PERSON> let the coaches do their job," <PERSON>Faulkiner</PERSON> said. "I look back at that 
blowup and hope it didn't have anything to do with us being run out. I hope the 
organization didn't say, 'The coaches are losing it."' 
</P>
<P>
The record will show that one man lost control, but when that man is at the 
top, everybody goes down with him. Then, they all move on. 
</P>
<P>
Last <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, the survivors with the <PERSON>Browns</PERSON> won a game against the <ORGANIZATION>Steelers</ORGANIZATION>, 
whose offense is under <PERSON>Walton</PERSON>'s command. This <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, the band of ex-Jets 
recruited by <PERSON>Carson</PERSON> visits a place they used to call home. They won't recognize 
it.

If <PERSON>Bud Carson</PERSON> ever wrote down his philosophy of life, it probably would come 
out sounding something like <PERSON>Murphy</PERSON>'s Law: If something can go wrong, it will, 
and it will go wrong at the worst possible moment. So, as he was standing on 
the sidelines during his <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> head-coaching debut <DATE>Sunday</DATE> at <LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Three 
Rivers Stadium</LOCATION> watching his Browns beat the Steelers worse than anyone ever had 
in the 57 years of their existence, <PERSON>Carson</PERSON> could not believe his eyes -- could 
not believe something so good could happen to him. 
</P>
<P>
Describing the <PERSON>Browns</PERSON>' shocking 51-0 victory, <PERSON>Carson Tuesday</PERSON> said, "It was a 
feeling of disbelief, and I was afraid it would all fall apart. We had a lot of 
fantastic luck. It was the type of thing that happens once in a lifetime." 
</P>
<P>
The folks in <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION> were no less astonished than <PERSON>Carson</PERSON>. Browns fans have 
not been quick to embrace the 58-year-old former <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> Jets defensive 
coordinator who was largely unknown to them when owner Art <PERSON>Modell</PERSON> brought him 
in to replace <PERSON>Marty Schottenheimer</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
Schottenheimer led the Browns to four straight playoff appearances, but he 
refused to give in to <ORGANIZATION>Modell</ORGANIZATION>'s desire to take a more innovative approach on 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival, <PERSON>Carson</PERSON> caused a public furor with his aborted plan to move 
popular Pro Bowl cornerback <PERSON>Hanford Dixon</PERSON> to safety. A 1-4 -preseason record 
only heightened the skepticism. 
</P>
<P>
But the eye-opener in <LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION> ought to convince a few people that <PERSON>Carson</PERSON> 
knows what he's doing. He promised an attack defense, and the <PERSON>Browns</PERSON> forced 
eight turnovers, scored three defensive touchdowns and recorded seven sacks. 
The headline in the <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION> Plain-Dealer's sports section on <DATE>Monday</DATE>, in type 
the size of the letter at the top of an eye chart, read simply: "51-0!" 
</P>
<P>
Knowing <PERSON>Carson</PERSON>'s penchant for finding the black lining in a silver cloud, the 
Plain-Dealer's <PERSON>Tony Grossi</PERSON> wrote: "<PERSON>Bud Carson</PERSON>, that great worrywart, must be 
wondering if it's all downhill from here." 
</P>
<P>
It would be next to impossible to play better. The Steelers were held to a 
record-low 53 yards and five first downs. "It was quite evident that was not a 
normal football game," <PERSON>Carson</PERSON> said afterward. "In all categories, we played 
almost a perfect game. I've never seen a defense create as many turnovers. It 
was one of the greatest games a defense can play in the <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION>." 
</P>
<P>
The only thing that bothered <PERSON>Carson</PERSON> about winning that way was the effect it 
had on Steelers Coach <PERSON>Chuck Noll</PERSON>, who gave <PERSON>Carson</PERSON> his start in the <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1972</DATE>. 
It was <PERSON>Carson</PERSON> who put together the "Steel Curtain" defense for the first two of 
<ORGANIZATION>Noll</ORGANIZATION>'s four Super Bowl champions. 
</P>
<P>
"<PERSON>Chuck</PERSON> is a good friend," <PERSON>Carson</PERSON> said. "A 7-6 win might've been better." The 
touching thing was that he meant it. 
</P>
<P>
Carson's emotions, which he always wears on his sleeve on game day, should be 
running just as high <DATE>Sunday</DATE> at <LOCATION>Cleveland Stadium</LOCATION> for the <PERSON>Browns</PERSON>' home opener 
against the Jets (0-1). Not that he has anything against the Jets. In fact, 
<PERSON>Carson</PERSON> has always been grateful to Coach <PERSON>Joe Walton</PERSON> for resurrecting his career 
by hiring him in <DATE>1985</DATE> after a year out of football. But it's a matter of pride. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be another (emotional game)," <PERSON>Carson</PERSON> said. "But they all count one, no 
matter who they are. You can't afford to make any game too big for your 
football squad." 
</P>
<P>
The battle of wits between <PERSON>Carson</PERSON>, who calls all the defensive signals, and 
<PERSON>Walton</PERSON> will be an intriguing one. All of the Jets' offensive weapons will not 
be at <ORGANIZATION>Walton</ORGANIZATION>'s disposal because of injuries to wide receivers <PERSON>Al Toon</PERSON> and 
<PERSON>Wesley Walker</PERSON>, so, <PERSON>Carson</PERSON> goes in with a clear advantage. 
</P>
<P>
No one is better at putting together a defensive game plan than <PERSON>Carson</PERSON>, which 
explains the difference between the <PERSON>Browns</PERSON>' indifferent preseason performance 
and their remarkable display against the <ORGANIZATION>Steelers</ORGANIZATION>, who had injury problems on 
the offensive line that <PERSON>Carson</PERSON> exploited. 
</P>
<P>
"We had not played well in the preseason, and I was concerned," <PERSON>Carson</PERSON> 
admitted. "Of course, we really hadn't game-planned because we were trying to 
find out who the football players were." 
</P>
<P>
During the week before the opener, <PERSON>Carson</PERSON> finally resolved the uproar over 
<PERSON>Dixon</PERSON>'s status by returning him to cornerback. The 30-year-old seemed to have 
lost a step in the past year, which was one reason <PERSON>Carson</PERSON> moved him to free 
safety. Early in training camp, <PERSON>Carson</PERSON>, who is known for his honesty, said 
<PERSON>Dixon</PERSON> was "showing slippage." That remark, for which <ORGANIZATION>Carson</ORGANIZATION> apologized, caused 
most of the trouble. In fact, <PERSON>Carson</PERSON> says it actually was <PERSON>Dixon</PERSON>'s idea to move 
to safety. 
</P>
<P>
"He wanted to be a safety; I think he talked to (49ers safety) <PERSON>Ronnie Lott</PERSON> at 
the <LOCATION>Pro Bowl</LOCATION>," <PERSON>Carson</PERSON> said. "I was trying to let him do that. I moved him back 
to cornerback because he looked completely different than when I first watched 
him. He just was a very slow starter. He can still run, or, I wouldn't have put 
him back. There's no question in my mind that I made a mistake." 
</P>
<P>
As harsh as <PERSON>Carson</PERSON> can be at times with his blunt criticism, his players know 
and appreciate the fact that he accepts his share of the blame when things go 
wrong. When someone asked him <DATE>Sunday</DATE> if <PERSON>Dixon</PERSON>'s return to cornerback were 
permanent, <PERSON>Carson</PERSON> replied, "Hanford is the cornerback until I screw it up again 
and move him back." 
</P>
<P>
If <ORGANIZATION>Carson</ORGANIZATION>'s honesty has offended some people or gotten him into trouble along 
the way, it also is the quality that caused so many associates to speak up for 
him last <DATE>January</DATE> when they heard that he had a shot at the <PERSON>Browns</PERSON>' job. Former 
Steelers greats <PERSON>Mel Blount</PERSON>, <PERSON>Jack Ham</PERSON> and <PERSON>Andy Russell</PERSON> made unsolicited calls to 
<ORGANIZATION>Modell</ORGANIZATION> to put in a good word. So did <ORGANIZATION>Steelers</ORGANIZATION> owner <PERSON>Dan Rooney</PERSON>, former Rams 
general manager <PERSON>Don Klosterman</PERSON> and Jets owner <PERSON>Leon Hess</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
"<PERSON>Leon Hess</PERSON> called and talked about <PERSON>Bud Carson</PERSON> the man," <PERSON>Modell</PERSON> recalled. "He 
said, 'You will not find a finer man."' 
</P>
<P>
Modell hired <PERSON>Carson</PERSON> with the expectation that he could get the Browns to the 
Super Bowl, but in a way, the pressure is no more than <PERSON>Carson</PERSON> put on himself in 
all the years he spent grinding to get a head job. His days of wondering and 
wandering to seven <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> teams are over. Cleveland is the final stop. "This is 
it," <PERSON>Carson</PERSON> said. "I'm not going anyplace else to coach football. I promised 
that to my wife, <PERSON>Linda</PERSON>. She's sick of moving, and I am, too."

WILL RAM OPPORTUNITY KNOCK?

<TEXT>
<P>
The question is whether a team of opportunists, the <ORGANIZATION>Rams</ORGANIZATION>, can win <DATE>Sunday</DATE> when 
the <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> 49ers are at the top of their game -- when they are more 
effective, offensively, than they were at any time in the <DATE>1980s</DATE>, during which 
they won three Super Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
After last week's games in <LOCATION>Candlestick Park</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Giants Stadium</ORGANIZATION>, the most 
pertinent answers came from two of the better players on the losing teams: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION>'s defensive player of the year, tackle <PERSON>Keith Millard</PERSON> of the 
<LOCATION>Minnesota Vikings</LOCATION>, said: "(The 49ers) won't be beaten the rest of the year. It 
doesn't matter who they play." 
</P>
<P>
 -- <PERSON>Gary Reasons</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>New York Giants</ORGANIZATION>, one of the <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION>'s steadiest 
linebackers, said: "I don't see the Rams beating the 49ers right now. They 
didn't play well enough (last <DATE>Sunday</DATE>) to beat them." 
</P>
<P>
What's happened in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> lately is that quarterback <PERSON>Joe Montana</PERSON> and his 
teammates and their coaches -- all of them handpicked by former coach <PERSON>Bill 
Walsh</PERSON> -- have raised offensive football to a new level. 
</P>
<P>
Probably no other 49er offensive team -- perhaps no offensive group anywhere, 
any time -- could have done what the 49ers did to a great defensive team in the 
<DATE>first half Sunday</DATE>: four <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> touchdown passes and 95 yards running by 
halfback <PERSON>Roger Craig</PERSON> for a 27-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
That was <PERSON>Walsh</PERSON> football. Same system. Same team. 
</P>
<P>
The only difference is that as coached by <PERSON>George Seifert</PERSON>, the 49ers have been 
even better. The reasons: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Their main players are more mature. 
</P>
<P>
 -- As a team, they have been relatively injury-free this season, improbably, 
for the second year in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 -- And unlike most defending Super Bowl champions, their players are all 
highly motivated. 
</P>
<P>
Said 49er safety <PERSON>Tom Holmoe</PERSON>: "There are a lot of guys here who would like to 
see how we do without (<PERSON>Walsh</PERSON>)." 
</P>
<P>
That, no doubt, is most of it. 
</P>
<P>
In the <DATE>second quarter last Sunday</DATE>, the 49ers were ahead by only 7-3 when the 
Vikings outguessed them and blanketed <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>'s primary receiver at the 
<LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION> eight-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
At that moment, 49er tight end <PERSON>Brent Jones</PERSON>, who was racing left at the left 
hash mark, looked back at <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>, saw the problem and changed direction 
instantly, racing laterally to his right through the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
Simultaneously, <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> rolled right at high speed and, shortly before rolling 
out of bounds, whipped the ball to Jones shortly before he ran out of bounds. 
</P>
<P>
The play had the look of <ORGANIZATION>The Catch</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1981</DATE> when a similar running pass to wide 
receiver <PERSON>Dwight Clark</PERSON> defeated <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> in the last minute of the <ORGANIZATION>NFC</ORGANIZATION> title game 
and launched the 49ers' Super Bowl dynasty. 
</P>
<P>
It had that look -- but it was much different. The Catch came on a designed 
play, with <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> lined up at right end. The Montana-Jones pass came on a broken 
play. 
</P>
<P>
When the ball is in <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>'s hands these days, the 49ers are so smooth that 
everything they do seems to have been rehearsed all year. As it usually has. 
They practice broken patterns at greater length than some college teams 
practice passing. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams are a more conventional big-play passing team than the 49ers, and 
their quarterback, <PERSON>Jim Everett</PERSON>, is a more assertive passer than <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>. Under 
pressure, he is more likely than <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> to throw the ball to receivers who may 
be faster than <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>'s, <PERSON>Henry Ellard</PERSON> and <PERSON>Flipper Anderson</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
Everett has demonstrated, in any case, that he belongs on the same field with 
<LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
One difference this season is that <PERSON>Everett</PERSON>'s team has, on the whole, been more 
opportunistic. The Rams have suddenly taken charge of five or six games when 
all seemed lost. 
</P>
<P>
Most recently, in last week's Ram game, the <ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION> began the first half with 
two field-goal drives, then began the second half with an 82-yard touchdown 
drive. That would have been good for a 13-0 lead -- possibly insurmountable -- 
if Giant Coach <PERSON>Bill Parcells</PERSON> hadn't blundered shortly before halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Sensitive to criticism that he is too conservative, <PERSON>Parcells</PERSON> called for a pass 
at the Giant 20 -- with 34 seconds left -- instead of asking quarterback <PERSON>Phil 
Simms</PERSON> simply to kneel down. The Giants weren't going anywhere even if they had 
completed it. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams intercepted and scored on the next play when the Giant defense, which 
wanted only to throttle Parcells, couldn't get its heart into a rush on 
<LOCATION>Everett</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Parcells' call will be rehashed interminably in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, taking its place with 
the <PERSON>Joe Pisarcik</PERSON> play a dozen years ago. That time, instead of asking 
quarterback <PERSON>Pisarcik</PERSON> to kneel down with the ball as time ran out, the <ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION> 
ran it, fumbled and lost the game. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants are a kneeling-down team, not a passing team. When you forget who 
you are, the <LOCATION>Anaheim</LOCATION> opportunists are going to make you pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
In <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION> <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>Cleveland Browns</ORGANIZATION> will be the sentimental favorite of 
those who don't want to see the Broncos in the Super Bowl again. When they were 
there in '87 and <DATE>'88</DATE>, they were blown out by 19 and 32 points. 
</P>
<P>
The Browns, what's more, have a chance, having come together in recent weeks. 
The return of running back <PERSON>Kevin Mack</PERSON> balances an offense that has all the 
passes -- in and out, short and long -- now that quarterback <PERSON>Bernie Kosar</PERSON>'s 
elbow merely hurts without hampering him. 
</P>
<P>
The <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION> defense is aging but still a force with, among others, linebacker 
<PERSON>Clay Matthews</PERSON> and defensive end <PERSON>Carl Hairston</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
Matthews remains the best fundamental linebacker in the league. Watching 
<PERSON>Matthews</PERSON> is like watching a clinic on playing linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
But if Bronco quarterback <PERSON>John Elway</PERSON> finally has a handle on his team's new 
offense, as it seemed last week when he passed as well as rookie <PERSON>Bobby Humphrey</PERSON> 
ran, it will be a <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION> day. 
</P>
<P>
The problem for <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION>, as it was for <LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION> <DATE>last week</DATE>, is that there is 
too little oxygen in Mile High Stadium and too much noise. 
</P>
<P>
In backing away from its noise-abatement program this season, the <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> has taken 
a strong stand in favor of unsportsmanlike conduct.

AFC: THEY GIVE SCHOTTENHEIMER HIS FIRST VICTORY OVER THE BRONCOS AFTER SIX

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
<PERSON>Marty Schottenheimer</PERSON> insisted it was nothing personal, but his <LOCATION>Kansas City 
Chiefs</LOCATION> saw it differently. 
</P>
<P>
After <PERSON>Steve DeBerg</PERSON> threw three touchdowns passes <DATE>Sunday</DATE> to lead a 31-20 victory 
over the <LOCATION>Denver Broncos</LOCATION>, the Chiefs all but dedicated the victory to 
<PERSON>Schottenheimer</PERSON> and his coaching staff. 
</P>
<P>
"There was nothing said, but you could sense all week that this was a special 
one, and you know why it was special," linebacker <PERSON>Dino Hackett</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
"We've all grown very close to this coaching staff. We wanted it for ourselves 
and for our team, sure. But it was nice to get it for them, too. They had 
suffered some tough losses to those guys, some heart-breaking losses." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Schottenheimer</PERSON> and several of his assistants came into the game 0-6 against 
<LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION>, including two last-minute losses in the <ORGANIZATION>AFC</ORGANIZATION> title game while he was in 
charge of the <LOCATION>Cleveland Browns</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
He finally broke through in his 100th game as a head coach as the Chiefs (9-4) 
moved a half-game ahead of the <ORGANIZATION>Raiders</ORGANIZATION>, who play at <LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION> tonight, in the AFC 
<LOCATION>West</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"It has nothing to do with the personal thing," <PERSON>Schottenheimer</PERSON> said. "Personal 
things don't mean a lot in this game." 
</P>
<P>
The victory was the fourth in a row and fifth in six games for the <LOCATION>Chiefs</LOCATION>, 
while the defending AFC champion Broncos (3-10) lost their sixth consecutive 
game, their longest losing streak loss since a nine-game slide in <DATE>1967</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
It was also the eighth time this season the Broncos lost after leading at 
halftime. 
</P>
<P>
"The typical things that seem to happen all year," <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION> Coach <PERSON>Dan Reeves</PERSON> 
said. "We are ahead at halftime and we come out and lose the game. They did an 
excellent job of executing their game plan." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>John Elway</PERSON> directed <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION> to two touchdowns after the Chiefs took a 7-0 lead 
on their first possession. 
</P>
<P>
DeBerg connected with <PERSON>Stephone Paige</PERSON> for 49-yard touchdown on the fifth play of 
the game when <LOCATION>Kansas City</LOCATION> fooled the Broncos with a flea-flicker. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew it was a touchdown coming out of the huddle," <PERSON>Paige</PERSON> said. "The play had 
been clicking so beautifully in practice, and then I saw we had exactly the 
kind of coverage we wanted." 
</P>
<P>
Elway got the Broncos the lead when he threw a five-yard touchdown pass to 
<PERSON>Shannon Sharpe</PERSON> and connected with <PERSON>Michael Young</PERSON> on a 16-yard scoring play. 
<LOCATION>Kansas City</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Nick Lowery</PERSON> kicked a 33-yard field goal, his 14th without a miss, 
to make it 13-10 at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Elway had the Broncos driving in the <DATE>third quarter</DATE>, but <PERSON>Hackett</PERSON> recovered 
<PERSON>Shannon Sharpe</PERSON>'s fumble to turn the game around. Eight plays later <ORGANIZATION>Barry Word</ORGANIZATION> 
scored on fourth-and-goal from the one to put the Chiefs ahead for good, 17-13. 
</P>
<P>
"As soon as I got the ball to secure it, I got hit and dropped the ball," 
<PERSON>Sharpe</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
It was 24-20 in the final minutes when, on fourth down, <PERSON>DeBerg</PERSON> threw a short 
pass to <PERSON>Robb Thomas</PERSON>, who turned it into a 27-yard scoring play. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a little surprised on fourth and three that they went for it," <PERSON>Elway</PERSON> 
said. "It was a bold move and a great call." 
</P>
<P>
DeBerg, a 15-year veteran who completed 18 of 27 passes for 254 yards, did not 
have a pass intercepted for the eighth consecutive game. 
</P>
<P>
He was not surprised by <PERSON>Schottenheimer</PERSON>'s decision to go for it on 
fourth-and-three from the 27 with a little more than 2:50 left. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it showed confidence in our football team," <PERSON>DeBerg</PERSON> said. "To be 
honest, I thought we'd go for it. If I was the one making the call, I would 
have gone for it. If we make the first down, the game's over. If we make a 
touchdown the game's really over." 
</P>
<P>
Elway completed 24 of 36 passes for 328 yards and two touchdowns to keep the 
Broncos in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Denver got a scare in the second half when <PERSON>Elway</PERSON> went down with what appeared 
to be a knee injury, but he stayed in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Said <PERSON>Schottenheimer</PERSON>: "Everybody talks about <PERSON>John Elway</PERSON> and his great ability, 
but the one thing that people don't talk about is the single most important 
thing -- that he is as fine a competitor as I have ever seen play this game."
