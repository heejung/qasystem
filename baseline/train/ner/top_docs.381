   New York -- For his new musical comedy, Stephen Sondheim
has chosen a preposterous and perverse subject -- the
assassins of presidents of the United States. More
specifically, "Assassins," which opened last night at
Playwrights Horizons, presents the stories of nine assassins,
four successes and five wannabes.
   This isn't the first time, of course, that Mr. Sondheim
has delighted in gruesome material. His "Sweeney Todd"
revolves around a murderous barber who has his victims baked
into meat pies. "Into the Woods" is a wicked treatment of
fairy tales. Even "West Side Story," whose lyrics Mr.
Sondheim wrote when he was a veritable Broadway baby, is the
brutal story of rival street gangs.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   All of <PERSON>Mr. Sondheim</PERSON>'s best work has a malicious humor that
is to musicals what <PERSON>Gary Larson</PERSON>'s "The Far Side" is to
cartoons. In "Assassins," the macabre <PERSON>Larson</PERSON> lurking inside
<PERSON>Mr. Sondheim</PERSON> shows his fangs more than ever, and right from
the start. In the opening scene, a carnival barker urges
folks to step right up to a game of "Shoot the President."
   If turning <PERSON>John Wilkes Booth</PERSON> and <PERSON>John Hinckley</PERSON> into merry
song-and-dance men sounds distasteful, well it is. The black
humor reaches squirm-in-your-seat proportions, however, only
when <PERSON>Lee Harvey Oswald</PERSON> makes his entrance late in the show.
Before that, "Assassins" is carried along by three enormous
assets: beguiling music, often hilarious comic turns, and
superb workmanship on the part of every member of the cast.
   <PERSON>Mr. Sondheim</PERSON>'s score counterpoints its characters' ghastly
doings with lovely music. Several songs draw heavily on
traditional American folk tunes. Three ballads, performed by
<PERSON>Patrick Cassidy</PERSON>, a glorious Irish tenor, sound as if they had
been written in <LOCATION>19th-century Appalachia</LOCATION>. And "Unworthy of
Your Love" is a heart-rendingly sweet love song in the manner
of a <PERSON>Carol King</PERSON> or <PERSON>Bob Dylan</PERSON> hit of the '60s.
   These melodious songs contrast eerily with the evil
weirdness of their singers' lives. "Unworthy of Your Love,"
for instance, is a duet sung by <PERSON>Ronald Reagan</PERSON>'s assailant
<PERSON>John Hinckley</PERSON> (<PERSON>Greg Germann</PERSON>) and <PERSON>Squeaky Fromme</PERSON> (Annie
Golden), the <PERSON>Charles Manson</PERSON> follower who tried to kill <ORGANIZATION>Gerald
Ford</ORGANIZATION>. The lovers for whom the singers are pining are <PERSON>Manson</PERSON>
and <PERSON>Jodie Foster</PERSON>, the movie star <PERSON>Hinckley</PERSON> pursued with love
letters around the time he shot at <PERSON>Mr. Reagan</PERSON>.
   In another scene, President <PERSON>James Garfield</PERSON>'s assassin
<PERSON>Charles Guiteau</PERSON> (<PERSON>Jonathan Hadary</PERSON>) prances up and down the
stairs of the gallows where he will be hanged, all the while
singing a spirited Gospel tune about "going to the Lordy."
The scene ends with <PERSON>Guiteau</PERSON> hanging from a noose. Similarly,
<PERSON>Abraham Lincoln</PERSON>'s killer <PERSON>John Wilkes Booth</PERSON> (<PERSON>Victor Garber</PERSON>)
breaks into song in the burning barn where he will shoot
himself. And <PERSON>William McKinley</PERSON>'s assassin <PERSON>Leon Czolgosz</PERSON> croons
"The Ballad of Czolgosz" from the electric chair.
Undoubtedly, <PERSON>Mr. Sondheim</PERSON> is striving for the musical
equivalent of gallows humor, but his splendid melodies and
crafty lyrics are vastly out of tune with his subject.
   By far the weakest part of the score is the play's
signature song, "Everybody's Got the Right." This is
especially unfortunate since it is the song that opens and
closes the show. In both cases, the assassins, arranged in a
kind of zombies' parody of a Broadway chorus line, earnestly
belt out the lyrics, "Everybody's got the right to be
different. Everybody's got the right to their dreams." This
is meant, I think, as a satiric comment on the American dream
gone berserk, but it ends up sounding trite and mildly
didactic.
   <PERSON>Mr. Sondheim</PERSON> does better with the failed assassins than
with those who, to adopt the script's tone, bagged their
Prez. The bunglers are all fruitcakes, and, happily, <PERSON>Mr.
Sondeim</PERSON> and his scriptwriter, <PERSON>John Weidman</PERSON>, dispense with the
psychoanalysis that weighs down their treatment of <LOCATION>Booth</LOCATION>,
<PERSON>Guiteau</PERSON> and <PERSON>Czolgosz</PERSON> and concentrate instead on the bunglers'
nuttiness.
   The actors ham it up deliciously. Lee Wilkof makes a manic
<PERSON>Samuel Byck</PERSON>, the man in a <LOCATION>Santa</LOCATION> suit who hijacked a plane
that he intended to crash into <PERSON>Richard Nixon</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Debra Monk</ORGANIZATION> is brilliant as <PERSON>Sara Jane Moore</PERSON>, the terminally
bored housewife who brought along her small son when she
tried to shoot <PERSON>Gerry Ford</PERSON>. And <PERSON>Ms. Golden</PERSON> makes a marvelous
<PERSON>Squeaky Fromme</PERSON>, the spacy flower child who can't remember why
her father threw her out of the house -- was it because they
were fighting over her eye makeup or the war in <LOCATION>Cambodia</LOCATION>?
   For the first 75 minutes, then, the captivating music and
zany comedy create an appealing entertainment. <PERSON>Jerry Zaks</PERSON>'s
snappy direction and <PERSON>Loren Sherman</PERSON>'s inventive turntable sets
add to the pleasure. With the appearance of <PERSON>Lee Harvey
Oswald</PERSON>, however, in the penultimate scene, a shadow falls
over the stage, and the show never recovers. It's as if
<ORGANIZATION>Shakespeare</ORGANIZATION> had tacked on the fearful ending of "King Lear"
to "As You Like It."
   The setting is, of course, the <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> Book Depository. The
time is just after noon, on <DATE>Nov. 22, 1963</DATE>.
   By this point, I'd grown a little fond of the gang of
assassins and their assorted quirks. But now the gang, led by
<LOCATION>Booth</LOCATION>, turns into Team Mephistopheles, urging a sullen <PERSON>Oswald</PERSON>
to follow their example and earn his place in history by
killing <PERSON>Jack Kennedy</PERSON>.
   <PERSON>Mr. Sondheim</PERSON> gave himself an insoluble problem: how to
force one of the great evildoers of our time into a musical
comedy. I suppose we should be grateful he did not attempt a
"Ballad of <PERSON>Lee Harvey Oswald</PERSON>" to match the ballads he gives
the other successful assassins. He might have had <PERSON>Oswald</PERSON>
dance a jig or burst into song as <PERSON>Jack Ruby</PERSON> shoots him down.
That would have been even worse than the straight ending <PERSON>Mr.
Sondheim</PERSON> actually settled for. Sincerity and sanctimony end
up spoiling -- or should I say, assassinating? -- what
started off as an impertinent and amusing show.

<LEADPARA>  THE American musical theater takes a bold leap into dark ground with Stephen
Sondheim's new musical, "Assassins," which opened Sunday at the 139-seat
Playwrights Horizons on West 42nd Street's Theater Row.;    At first sitting,
at least, the tabloid-sized show about presidential assassins and the society
that produced them looks like a small masterpiece of political theater. It is
pungent with satirical irony, grotesquely funny at times and consistently
disturbing.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Living  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  SONDHEIM'S BULL'S-EYE
'ASSASSINS' IS NEW YORK'S HOTTEST TICKET  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Theater  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     For musical inspiration, <PERSON>Sondheim</PERSON> has relied largely on American forms --
folk ballads and traditional marches. A balladeer in overalls (<PERSON>Patrick
Cassidy</PERSON>) is the narrator. The music is simpler than <PERSON>Sondheim</PERSON>'s last two scores
("Into the <PERSON>Woods</PERSON>," "<DATE>Sunday</DATE> in the Park With George") and likely to disappoint
the composer's more fervent fans.;    A hot ticket;    A new <PERSON>Sondheim</PERSON> work is
always an event, but the shock waves caused by the composer-lyricist's choice
of subject has helped make this one the hottest ticket of the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> theater
season. Promised a gallery of rogues in song, from <PERSON>John Wilkes Booth</PERSON> to <PERSON>Lee
Harvey Oswald</PERSON>, theatergoers have stood in line for hours for ticket
cancellations and returns.;    The production's two-month run for mostly
subscription audiences is scheduled to end on <DATE>Feb. 16</DATE>. Stories have circulated
about the critic for a major newspaper who turned blue in the outside line and
still didn't get a ticket. One Broadway producer of note complained that the
theater had turned down his request for tickets.;    <PERSON>Sondheim</PERSON> has shown
himself willing to upset audiences with the butchery of "<PERSON>Sweeney Todd</PERSON>," his
musical about a murderous barber. And he has tackled political theater in
"Pacific Overtures," a satire on <PERSON>Commodore Matthew Perry</PERSON>'s opening of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> to
Western trade. For "Assassins" he has been rejoined by <PERSON>John Weidman</PERSON>, who wrote
the book for "Pacific Overtures.";    Based on an idea by <PERSON>Charles Gilbert Jr.</PERSON>,
of <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION>'s University of the Arts, "Assassins" brings together in a
hallucinatory afterlife nine people who made or planned attempts on the lives
of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> presidents.;    The musical makes the point that these nine are all
outsiders who have been denied their expected share of the American dream.
There is one chilling moment when Booth calmly explains to <PERSON>Lee Harvey Oswald</PERSON>
(<PERSON>Jace Alexander</PERSON>) that assassination is not just murder but a ticket to
immortality.;    Taken as a group, these people have the air of inmates of a
mental institution where the reigning delusion is not being a Napoleon but
rather a <PERSON>Charles Guiteau</PERSON> (<PERSON>Jonathan Hadary</PERSON>) shooting President <PERSON>Garfield</PERSON>, or a
<PERSON>Giuseppe Zangara</PERSON> (<PERSON>Eddie Korbich</PERSON>) missing <PERSON>Franklin D. Roosevelt</PERSON> and hitting
<LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON>Anton Cermak</PERSON>. If they aren't all crazy, there is certainly an
appalling incoherence in the ultimate act they all commit -- an insane
disparity between motive and behavior.;    <PERSON>Terrence Mann</PERSON>'s immigrant workman
<PERSON>Leon Czolgosz</PERSON> is an expressionless force of righteous anger, ignited by a love
for <PERSON>Emma Goldman</PERSON> and gunning down <PERSON>William McKinley</PERSON>. For comic relief, there
are <PERSON>Gerald Ford</PERSON> and the two addled women who bungled their mission. <PERSON>Charlie
Manson</PERSON>'s acolyte, <PERSON>Lynette</PERSON> "Squeaky" <PERSON>Fromme</PERSON> (Annie Golden), is a caricature of
the flower child of the '60s, playing mentor to a moony, guitar-playing <PERSON>John
Hinckley</PERSON> (<PERSON>Greg Germann</PERSON>), who shoots again and again at a smiling portrait of
<PERSON>Ronald Reagan</PERSON> without even creasing it. The formidable <ORGANIZATION>Debra Monk</ORGANIZATION> gives a
memorably nutty performance as the suburbanite <PERSON>Sara Jane Moore.</PERSON>;    The most
frighteningly funny character of all is the little-known <PERSON>Samuel Byck</PERSON>, a loser
who, it seems, planned to kill <PERSON>Richard Nixon</PERSON> by crashing a plane into the
<ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION>. Lee Wilkof gives this character's disordered mind a wild airing
as he talks to <PERSON>Leonard Bernstein</PERSON> on a tape recorder.;    A bit preachy;   
"Assassins" is not a perfect piece of work. There is some stupid show-business
nonsense about Booth killing because of bad reviews. (He is seen reading
Variety in a saloon.) There also is a tendency to hammer away at the theme of
social inequity, as if that explained everything. But on the whole, this is
provocative stuff, handled with imagination.  </TEXT>

Gerber Products Says Chief McKinley
Is Retiring Early for 'Personal Reasons'

   <ORGANIZATION>Gerber Products Co.</ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON>William L. McKinley</PERSON>, its 63-year-old chairman and chief executive officer, was taking early retirement for "personal reasons." 

   <PERSON>Leo D. Goulet</PERSON>, 61, president and chief operating officer, will assume the chief executive's post immediately. 
However, the <LOCATION>Fremont</LOCATION>, Mich.-based company said that <PERSON>Mr. McKinley</PERSON>, who became chief executive less than <DATE>two years ago</DATE>, will stay on as chairman until <DATE>July</DATE> "to provide for an orderly transition." 

   Messrs. 
<PERSON>McKinley</PERSON> and <PERSON>Goulet</PERSON> both refused to discuss the change further. 
A company spokesman declined to elaborate on the reasons for the early retirement. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Goulet</PERSON>, in a prepared statement, said he didn't anticipate making any major changes in the company. 
He said that <PERSON>Mr. McKinley</PERSON> "leaves the company with a strong financial structure . . . 
Our competitive position also is excellent in all market areas, particularly Gerber baby foods." 

   But Wall Street analysts, who have been sharply critical of <PERSON>Mr. McKinley</PERSON>'s performance during the past year, said they thought he was forced out under pressure from the directors, and perhaps the fear of a takeover bid. 
No bidder has emerged for the company. 

   "I think the board is being responsive to shareholders who were generally dissatisfied with the company's reluctance to maximize shareholder value," said <PERSON>John M. McMillin</PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION>Prudential-Bache Securities</ORGANIZATION>. 
"It's a well-known feeling on Wall Street that management wasn't trying to do that." 

   Specifically, analysts criticized <PERSON>Mr. McKinley</PERSON>'s handling of the non-food businesses. 
"His non-food operations never performed up to snuff," said <PERSON>William Maguire</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Merrill Lynch Research</ORGANIZATION>. 
He singled out the peformance of <PERSON>Gerber</PERSON>'s truck, furniture, and apparel operations. 

   The company's net income for the fiscal year ended <DATE>March 31</DATE> dropped <PERCENT>20%</PERCENT> from the previous year for various reasons including stepped-up advertising. 

   "He was chairman over a pretty rough period of time," said <PERSON>Daniel F. Gerber</PERSON>, a board member and son of the company's founder. 

   Asked if the board asked <PERSON>Mr. McKinley</PERSON> to resign, <PERSON>Mr. Gerber</PERSON> said, "I wouldn't have any comment about that. 
<PERSON>Mr. McKinley</PERSON> resigned simply for personal reasons." 

   <PERSON>Mr. McKinley</PERSON>, who has worked with <PERSON>Gerber</PERSON> for 37 years, became chairman and chief executive in <DATE>November 1985</DATE>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Goulet</PERSON>, who has worked with <PERSON>Gerber</PERSON> for 32 years, became president and chief operating officer in <DATE>February 1983</DATE>.

The company previously announced that <PERSON>Mr. McKinley</PERSON> stepped down as chief executive officer in <DATE>May</DATE>, and as chairman earlier this week. 

   Gerber has said <PERSON>Mr. McKinley</PERSON>, 63 years old, severed his ties with the company for "personal reasons." 

   The baby-food maker also said it expects to appoint a new chief executive officer within two months. 
Gerber appointed <PERSON>Leo D. Goulet</PERSON> to that post in <DATE>May</DATE>, but he died of a heart attack earlier this month. 

   <PERSON>Robert D. Carlson</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Crowley, Milner &amp; Co.</ORGANIZATION>, a Detroit-based department store chain, will fill out the final year of <PERSON>Mr. McKinley</PERSON>'s term. 

   Gerber also announced that <PERSON>George A. Purvis</PERSON>, 54, was given the newly created title of corporate vice president-research and development. 
He was previously a vice president in the same department. 
J. <PERSON>Ronald Lovasz</PERSON>, 54, was promoted to the newly created position of vice president-quality control, research division. 
He previously was director of corporate quality control.

<TEXT>
   Add one more issue to the list of conundrums
<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> will have to unravel when it returns from its <DATE>summer</DATE>
recess next month: whether the tallest mountain in <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION>
should be renamed.
   It's a perennial duel between an <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> congressman protecting the
honor of <PERSON>William McKinley</PERSON>, the 25th <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> president after whom the
peak is named, and an <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION> senator defending his state's right to
name its own land features.
   The motives of <PERSON>Sen. Ted Stevens</PERSON>, <LOCATION>R-Alaska</LOCATION>, are easy to discern.
   ``His long-range goal is to see if the mountain can be renamed
with Alaskans' wishes,'' says <PERSON>Connie Godwin</PERSON>, his spokeswoman.
   It takes only a quick look at the background of Rep. <PERSON>Ralph
Regula</PERSON>, <LOCATION>R-Ohio</LOCATION>, to explain why he cares about the name of the
20,320-foot mountain in <LOCATION>central Alaska</LOCATION>, a continent away from the
people he represents.
   ``<ORGANIZATION>McKinley</ORGANIZATION> is from my district,'' <PERSON>Regula</PERSON> says.
   McKinley, assassinated in <DATE>1901</DATE>, was not only from <PERSON>Regula</PERSON>'s
district, but once held <PERSON>Regula</PERSON>'s seat in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> and is buried in
the district. Regula is even a graduate of the <ORGANIZATION>William McKinley
School of Law</ORGANIZATION>.
   McKinley _ the mountain _ is in <LOCATION>Denali National Park</LOCATION>, which was
renamed in <DATE>1980</DATE> from <LOCATION>McKinley National Park</LOCATION>. Denali is an Indian
word for ``The Great One,'' and many Alaskans would like to see the
mountain bear the same name.
   ``It's owned by 230 million Americans,'' <PERSON>Regula</PERSON> said last week.
``<LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION> gets <MONEY>millions of dollars</MONEY> in taxes, and taxpayers from the
entire country have a right to decide what happens there.''
   A provision forbidding the government to rename the mountain was
buried in the fine print of the annual <ORGANIZATION>Interior Department</ORGANIZATION> spending
bill that the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> passed <DATE>July 12</DATE>. When the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> approved its
version of the legislation two weeks later, the Mt. McKinley
language was removed.
   It's a legislative dance that has been going on for years, and
<PERSON>Regula</PERSON> has always prevailed.
   ``Ted goes along with a one-year prohibition, but not with
statutorily naming it <PERSON>Mt. McKinley</PERSON>,'' says <PERSON>Regula</PERSON>.
   Like most geographic features, <ORGANIZATION>Mt. McKinley</ORGANIZATION> was not given its
name by law. Rather, its name is officially recognized by the <ORGANIZATION>Board
of Geographic Names</ORGANIZATION>, a division of the <ORGANIZATION>Interior Department</ORGANIZATION>.
   It was named <ORGANIZATION>Mt. McKinley</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1896</DATE>, when <ORGANIZATION>McKinley</ORGANIZATION> was <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>
governor and the Republican presidential candidate against Democrat
<PERSON>William Jennings Bryan</PERSON>.
   In <DATE>1975</DATE>, the <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION> state legislature passed a resolution
requesting that the park and the mountain be renamed to <ORGANIZATION>Denali</ORGANIZATION>.
Congressional hearings were held <DATE>two years later</DATE>. In a compromise,
the park was renamed in <DATE>1980</DATE> but the mountain retained its name.
   Negotiators from the two chambers probably will meet next month
to work out a compromise bill.

Gerber Chief's Death Revives Speculation
On Company's Vulnerability to Takeover

<TEXT>
   <ORGANIZATION>Gerber Products Co.</ORGANIZATION>'s 61-year-old president and chief executive officer, <PERSON>Leo D. Goulet</PERSON>, died after an apparent heart attack <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, and a retired chief executive will fill the job until the <LOCATION>Fremont</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mich.</LOCATION>, company can find a permanent replacement. 

   News of the death reignited longtime rumors that the baby-food producer could face a hostile takeover bid, although none has been made public. 
Gerber stock closed yesterday at <MONEY>$52.50</MONEY>, up <MONEY>$4</MONEY> in <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading. 

   Many traders felt yesterday that trading in Gerber stock increased because of <PERSON>Mr. Goulet</PERSON>'s death, which some felt added to the continuing turmoil and increased the company's vulnerability. 
"A lot of arbs are in there today," said one arbitrager. 

   "His death causes some instability, and instability by nature makes a company more vulnerable," added <PERSON>John M. McMillin</PERSON>, an analyst for <ORGANIZATION>Prudential-Bache Securities</ORGANIZATION>. 

   <PERSON>Gerber</PERSON> said it has hired an independent consultant to find a new chief executive, and said it would consider an outsider for the first time in its 59-year history. 
The move is apparently aimed in part at quelling Wall Street criticism of Gerber management. 

   "Independence is No. 1 on their list" of factors in seeking a new chief executive, said <PERSON>William E. Gould</PERSON>, the manager of the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> firm conducting the search. 

   Until that person is found, <PERSON>Carl G. Smith</PERSON>, 66, will be acting chief executive. 
He held that post from <DATE>1982 through 1985</DATE>, and served as chairman from <DATE>1983</DATE> through <DATE>February 1986</DATE>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Smith</PERSON> has remained a member of the board, and has been chairman of its executive committee. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Goulet</PERSON>'s death came less than six weeks after his appointment as chief executive. 
He was promoted from chief operating officer after <PERSON>William L. McKinley</PERSON>, 63, took early retirement for what the company said were "personal reasons." 
As previously announced, <PERSON>Mr. McKinley</PERSON> will retain the chairmanship until later this month. 

   Gerber officials and directors had declined to elaborate on the reasons for <PERSON>Mr. McKinley</PERSON>'s departure as chief executive, but analysts suggested <PERSON>Mr. McKinley</PERSON> was forced out because of shareholder dissatisfaction with the company's performance. 
Gerber net income in the <DATE>fiscal year ended March 31</DATE> was <MONEY>$36.4 million</MONEY>, down <PERCENT>20%</PERCENT> from <MONEY>$45.5 million</MONEY> a year earlier. 

   A major reason for the drop in net was widespread publicity about glass allegedly found in some jars of <ORGANIZATION>Gerber</ORGANIZATION>'s baby food. 
Although those claims were never substantiated, the company was forced to substantially increase promotions and advertising. 
<PERSON>Mr. McKinley</PERSON> also was criticized for his management of the company's non-food operations, such as furniture and apparel. 

   Speculation about a takeover has been high because <PERSON>Gerber</PERSON> is a relatively small company, is No. 1 in the baby-food market, and is considered an underperformer. 

   A company spokesman wouldn't comment on why <PERSON>Gerber</PERSON> had decided to consider candidates outside the company, as well as insiders, for chief executive, although analysts said no obvious in-house replacements existed. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Gould</PERSON>, the search consultant, said his firm began its search before <PERSON>Mr. Goulet</PERSON>'s death because the company was looking ahead to the next generation of leadership. 
"A review of the company's executive succession plan was launched in <DATE>June</DATE> to assure continued strong leadership in the foreseeable future," <PERSON>Mr. Smith</PERSON>, the acting chief executive, said in a prepared statement. 

   Gerber wants someone "around 50 to 55 years old who can give them 10 to 15 years of leadership," <PERSON>Mr. Gould</PERSON> said. 
He added that he has already interviewed four internal candidates and expects to interview about a half-dozen external candidates. 
The company hopes to have a replacement in two to four months. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Gould</PERSON> declined to say whether <PERSON>Mr. Smith</PERSON> was being considered as the new full-time chief executive. 
The company doesn't require retirement at age 65, the spokesman said. 
<PERSON>Mr. Smith</PERSON> couldn't be reached for comment. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Goulet</PERSON>, a native of <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>, joined <PERSON>Gerber</PERSON> in <DATE>1955</DATE> and spent most of his career in the company's international operations. 
In <DATE>1982</DATE>, he became executive vice president of the general merchandise division and was elected to the board. 
The following year he took over as president and chief operating officer.

<HL> Gerber to Post Drop
In 4th-Quarter Profit

DOW JONES INTERVIEW (CEO) </IN>
<DATELINE> FREMONT, Mich.  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   <ORGANIZATION>Gerber Products Co.</ORGANIZATION>'s chairman and chief executive officer said he generally agreed with analysts' forecasts that the company will post lower profit for its fiscal fourth quarter. 

   Analysts' estimates that the company earned about <MONEY>50 cents</MONEY> to <MONEY>55 cents</MONEY> a share for the quarter ended yesterday are generally "accurate," <PERSON>William L. McKinley</PERSON> said. 
Year-earlier profit was <MONEY>60 cents</MONEY> a share. 
<PERSON>Mr. McKinley</PERSON> attributed the profit decline to a variety of factors, including the "very substantial" cost of a stepped-up advertising and promotion campaign in <LOCATION>Gerber</LOCATION>'s baby food business. 

   In the year-ago <DATE>fourth quarter</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Gerber</ORGANIZATION> earned <MONEY>$12.3 million</MONEY> on sales of <MONEY>$242.7 million</MONEY>. 
<PERSON>Mr. McKinley</PERSON> estimated that sales in the quarter just ended increased to more than <MONEY>$280 million</MONEY>. 

   He said analysts' estimates that the baby products company will report profit for the fiscal year of about <MONEY>$1.75</MONEY> to <MONEY>$1.80</MONEY> a share are "reasonable." 
Sales for the year were more than <MONEY>$1 billion</MONEY>. 

   In <DATE>fiscal 1986</DATE>, <PERSON>Gerber</PERSON> had profit of <MONEY>$45.5 million</MONEY>, or <MONEY>$2.23</MONEY> a share, on sales of <MONEY>$967.9 million</MONEY>. 
Net income included a charge of <MONEY>$4.2 million</MONEY> for a plant closing. 

   <PERSON>Mr. McKinley</PERSON> said the advertising and promotions campaign was launched to counter a consumer scare early last year when a wave of allegations about glass shards in the company's baby food surfaced. 
The complaints never were tied to <PERSON>Gerber</PERSON>'s production process, <PERSON>Mr. McKinley</PERSON> said. 
He added that the number of complaints have dwindled to "nothing outside the normal." 

   <PERSON>Mr. McKinley</PERSON> said some small charges associated with the restructuring of <ORGANIZATION>Gerber</ORGANIZATION>'s furniture business also hurt <DATE>fourth-quarter</DATE> profit. 
"I'm not talking more than a <MONEY>few cents</MONEY> a share, but it will adversely affect <DATE>this quarter</DATE>," he said. 

   The chief executive said the company's transportation group, which includes a trucking business, "isn't part of our long-term growth strategy," though he wouldn't say what the company plans to do with the business. 

   <PERSON>Mr. McKinley</PERSON> wouldn't comment on whether the company plans any change in its 33-cent-a-share quarterly dividend. 
He said the company isn't expecting to pursue any new financing in the near term and has "nothing major" planned in the way of acquisitions.

Gerber Products Appoints Entenmann's
David Johnson to Chief Executive Post
---
By Frank E. James
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL>
<DD> 09/16/87</DD>
<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO>
<IN> GEB WNEWS </IN>
<TEXT>
   <ORGANIZATION>Gerber Products Co.</ORGANIZATION> chose as its new top officer the executive who helped <ORGANIZATION>Entenmann's Inc.</ORGANIZATION> grow into a nationally recognized baked-goods company. 

   <PERSON>Gerber</PERSON> said it named <PERSON>David W. Johnson</PERSON>, 55 years old, as chairman, president and chief executive officer of the baby-food maker. 
<PERSON>Mr. Johnson</PERSON>, currently a <ORGANIZATION>General Foods Corp.</ORGANIZATION> vice president, is also president and chief executive officer of that company's <ORGANIZATION>Entenmann</ORGANIZATION>'s subsidiary. 
<PERSON>Mr. Johnson</PERSON> is scheduled to take over at <LOCATION>Freemont</LOCATION>, Mich.-based Gerber by <DATE>Oct. 19</DATE>. 

   The appointment was welcomed by Wall Street analysts, who viewed it as possibly signaling a return of stability to <PERSON>Gerber</PERSON> management and speeding the company's financial turnaround, perhaps through a return to the core foods business. 

   At <ORGANIZATION>Gerber</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Johnson</PERSON> succeeds the late <PERSON>Leo D. Goulet</PERSON>, who died in <DATE>July</DATE> at age 61 after an apparent heart attack. 
The uncertainty following <PERSON>Mr. Goulet</PERSON>'s death had fueled long-standing rumors that management turmoil and weak earnings might make <PERSON>Gerber</PERSON> vulnerable to a hostile takeover bid, driving up the company's stock price. 

   Yesterday in <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading, <ORGANIZATION>Gerber</ORGANIZATION> fell <MONEY>$2</MONEY>, to close at <MONEY>$49.625</MONEY> a share, amid a broad decline in the market. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Goulet</PERSON> had been chief executive for only six weeks before his death. 
He had succeeded <PERSON>William L. McKinley</PERSON>, 63, who took early retirement. 
Analysts have suggested <PERSON>Mr. McKinley</PERSON> was forced out because of shareholder dissatisfaction with the company's performance. 
Gerber's profit for the year ended <DATE>March 31</DATE> fell <PERCENT>20%</PERCENT> from a year earlier to <MONEY>$36.4 million</MONEY>. 

   "The company had been adrift without a sail," said <PERSON>John M. McMillin</PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION>Prudential-Bache Securities</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. 
"But I'm pleased they could name such a very qualified person in so relatively short a time. 
This should add stability and mollify some takeover rumors." 

   <PERSON>Mr. McMillin</PERSON> added that <PERSON>Mr. Johnson</PERSON> joins Gerber at a good time, because the company seems to be turning around. 
Fiscal <DATE>first-quarter</DATE> net income rose <PERCENT>28%</PERCENT> to <MONEY>$8 million</MONEY>, or <MONEY>41 cents</MONEY> a share, from <MONEY>$6.6 million</MONEY>, or <MONEY>32 cents</MONEY> a share, a year earlier. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Johnson</PERSON>, he said, will be in a position to accelerate that trend, "particularly if he divests those low-return businesses which don't make sense, like furniture, insurance and child-care centers." 
<PERSON>Mr. McMillin</PERSON> said <PERSON>Mr. Johnson</PERSON>'s strong food-industry background makes it likely that he'll return Gerber to its core food business. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Johnson</PERSON> couldn't be reached for comment but <PERSON>Gerber</PERSON> issued a statement in <PERSON>Mr. Johnson</PERSON>'s name indicating that he may do just that. 
"My initial mission will be a thorough review of our various businesses, building on our strengths, and reviewing our strategy on every segment of the business" to meet company and shareholder standards for high profitabilty, the statement said. 

   For the past eight years, <PERSON>Mr. Johnson</PERSON> has headed <ORGANIZATION>Entenmann</ORGANIZATION>'s, which was acquired by <ORGANIZATION>General Foods</ORGANIZATION> from <ORGANIZATION>Warner-Lambert Co.</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1982</DATE>. 
During his tenure at <ORGANIZATION>Entenmann</ORGANIZATION>'s, the unit went from being an <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION>, regional baking concern to a national marketer with sales that increased fourfold.

<TEXT>
Ever since the assassination of President <PERSON>William McKinley</PERSON> in <DATE>1901</DATE>, American
financial markets have always paid tribute to the death of heads of state by
shutting up shop.
But in closing down for an entire session to mark the passing of <PERSON>Richard
Nixon</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> has ruffled a few feathers - and not
solely because people feel that <PERSON>Nixon</PERSON>, the only US president to resign in
disgrace, might merit something less than the full treatment.
At least two other exchanges, <ORGANIZATION>Nasdaq</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Pacific Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>,
unabashedly say they would have preferred to remain open but were forced to
follow the <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION>'s lead for technical reasons only.
Wall Streeters were also quick to point out the damage that unscheduled
closings could inflict on the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> market's efforts to fend off its
competitors from overseas.
In deciding to close for the full session, the exchange is indeed affording
<PERSON>Nixon</PERSON> an honour denied another president 30 years ago.
In <DATE>1964</DATE>, trading was suspended for only half the day after <PERSON>Herbert Hoover</PERSON>
died.
But then <PERSON>Hoover</PERSON> just happened to be in the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1929</DATE>, the year of
the mother of all stock market crashes.

   A suspected <ORGANIZATION>Irish Republican Army</ORGANIZATION>
terrorist bragged that the group's next target would be British
helicopters once it had control of a Stinger anti-aircraft missile,
according to court papers.
   <PERSON>Kevin McKinley</PERSON>, who also allegedly told federal undercover
agents that his group was responsible for a <DATE>1984</DATE> assassination
attempt against British Prime Minister <PERSON>Margaret Thatcher</PERSON> and other
bombings, was arrested <DATE>Friday</DATE> in a <LOCATION>Palm Beach</LOCATION> parking lot as he
tried to wedge a 5-foot Stinger missile in his car. Three other men
were also arrested.
   The four remained in prison today after a bail hearing was
postponed until <DATE>Friday</DATE> at the request of both sides.
   ``All have a viable defense and it will be pursued to the
highest degree,'' said <PERSON>Roger Colton</PERSON>, a lawyer for <ORGANIZATION>McKinley</ORGANIZATION>, 33;
<PERSON>Seamus Moley</PERSON>, 30 and <PERSON>Joseph McColgan</PERSON>, 39, all Irish citizens.
   Colton would not give details of a possible defense but said
entrapment is ``a possible avenue.''
   Co-defendant <PERSON>Sean McCann</PERSON>, 34, a Canadian, was represented by
attorney <PERSON>Michael Salnick</PERSON>.
   Agents posing as arms dealers arrested the men shortly after
<PERSON>Moley</PERSON> handed over <MONEY>$47,500</MONEY> for a hand-held Stinger missile and
<ORGANIZATION>McKinley</ORGANIZATION> was taken to a <LOCATION>West Palm Beach</LOCATION> warehouse to inspect the
weapon, authorities said.
   Agents had planned to follow McKinley from the warehouse, but he
was arrested on the spot after he discovered the Stinger did not
fit in his car, the federal <ORGANIZATION>Bureau of Alcohol</ORGANIZATION>, Tobacco and Firearms
said <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>. The three other men were arrested in <LOCATION>North Palm
Beach</LOCATION>, about 65 miles north of <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>.
   The Stinger, which weighs about 35 pounds, is used to launch a
single surface-to-air missile. The weapon was on loan from the
Marines and had no warhead.
   <PERSON>McKinley</PERSON> said the Stinger was to be used by the provisional wing
of the <ORGANIZATION>IRA</ORGANIZATION> against British helicopters in <LOCATION>Northern Ireland</LOCATION>,
according to court papers filed by Customs and <ORGANIZATION>ATF</ORGANIZATION>.
   McKinley also told agents ``his people'' were responsible for a
<DATE>1984</DATE> bombing of a hotel in <LOCATION>Brighton</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION>IRA</ORGANIZATION> claimed
responsibility for the bombing, which killed five people, including
two senior Conservative Party figures. <PERSON>Mrs. Thatcher</PERSON> escaped
unharmed.
   During several meetings from <DATE>Nov. 20</DATE> to <DATE>Jan. 12</DATE>, the suspects
also said they were seeking .50-caliber rifles, C-4 explosives and
grenade launchers. All are charged with violations of the Arms
Export Control Act and Neutrality Law and other weapons violations.
   Assistant <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON>Barbara Patras</PERSON> said they each could
receive up to 30 years in prison and <MONEY>$1.25 million</MONEY> in fines if
convicted.
   The <ORGANIZATION>IRA</ORGANIZATION>, a mainly Roman Catholic guerrilla group outlawed in
<LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Ireland</LOCATION>, is fighting to end British rule over <LOCATION>Northern
Ireland</LOCATION> and unite it with the Irish Republic.

Will <PERSON>Bradley</PERSON>, a handsome, urbane studio trombonist who emerged from those

The <ORGANIZATION>Associated Press</ORGANIZATION> reported <DATE>Thursday</DATE> that <PERSON>Bradley</PERSON>, noted for such popular

With drummer <PERSON>Ray McKinley</PERSON>, whom <PERSON>Bradley</PERSON> lured from <PERSON>Jimmy Dorsey</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>Will

sentimental ballads, jive tunes and boogie-woogie.

<P>
Called by <PERSON>Glenn Miller</PERSON> "the best of all" the trombonists of his day, <PERSON>Wilbur

<ORGANIZATION>McKinley</ORGANIZATION> singing and playing drums. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Louise Tobin</PERSON>, then <PERSON>Harry James</PERSON>' wife, sang "Deed I Do" with <PERSON>Bradley</PERSON> shortly 
before the band switched emphasis from ballads to boogie. 
</P>
<P>
Slack, later to form his own famous band, was the catalyst behind a white group 
of musicians playing what had been a black innovation. 
</P>
<P>
In <PERSON>George T. Simons</PERSON>' book "The Big Bands," <PERSON>McKinley</PERSON> recounts how the musicians 
were experimenting with instrumental arrangements based on the blues with an 
eight-to-the-bar piano boogie beat. 
</P>
<P>
"There was one point where I had a drum break and for some reason or other that 
night instead of playing the break, I sang out "Oh, beat me, daddy, eight to 
the bar!" After the set <ORGANIZATION>McKinley</ORGANIZATION> encouraged the writing of a song with that 
title and it became the biggest of the <PERSON>Bradley</PERSON> band's hits, selling more than 
100,000 copies. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley tried to chase that success with "Rock-a-Bye Boogie," "Scrub Me, <LOCATION>Mama</LOCATION>, 
With a Boogie Beat," "Fry Me, <LOCATION>Cookie</LOCATION>, With a Can of Lard" and others. 
</P>
<P>
But he quickly became disenchanted with the band's new sound, preferring the 
more solid tunes of the day, and he and <ORGANIZATION>McKinley</ORGANIZATION> eventually split up, <ORGANIZATION>McKinley</ORGANIZATION> 
to form his own group in <DATE>1942</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley brought new talent into his band after <PERSON>McKinley</PERSON>'s departure, among them 
a young drummer named <PERSON>Shelley Manne</PERSON> and a trumpet player who called himself 
<ORGANIZATION>Shorty Rogers</ORGANIZATION>. These two were to become an integral part of modern jazz a few 
years later. 
</P>
<P>
But the wartime military draft decimated the ranks of the younger players and 
<PERSON>Simon</PERSON> writes of one engagement in <LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION> in which <PERSON>Bradley</PERSON> told him that six 
musicians moved from the bandstand to the recruiting station in a single week. 
</P>
<P>
After that <PERSON>Bradley</PERSON> was forced to cancel many of his personal appearances and 
rely on studio musicians for recordings. Bradley himself soon returned to the 
studios where he had started. 
</P>
<P>
He is survived by his wife, <PERSON>Joan</PERSON>, a son, a daughter and a grandson.

   ATLANTA -- Bank South Corp. tapped two senior executives
of C&amp;S/Sovran Corp. on the eve of a reported merger agreement
between C&amp;S/Sovran and NCNB Corp.
   Patrick L. Flinn was named president and chief executive
officer of Bank South. Mr. Flinn, 49 years old, had been
group executive vice president in charge of real estate and

region.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   <PERSON>Mr. Flinn</PERSON> had been with C&amp;S/Sovran and its predecessor
company, <ORGANIZATION>Citizens &amp; Southern Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, for 25 years. <PERSON>Mr. Flinn</PERSON>

Guyton</PERSON> resigned in <DATE>June</DATE> under pressure from the board.
   <PERSON>John E. McKinley</PERSON> was named senior executive vice president
and chief credit officer of <ORGANIZATION>Bank South</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>Mr. McKinley</PERSON>, 47, was
<ORGANIZATION>C&amp;S/Sovran</ORGANIZATION>'s group executive vice president and chief credit

vice president of <ORGANIZATION>Bank South</ORGANIZATION> and head of corporate
communications. "Everyone here is delighted to have gotten
them." Both men assume their new jobs <DATE>Aug. 1</DATE>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Bank South</ORGANIZATION>, which has been hammered by large loan losses,

<HEAD>Experts Say Top of Ticket, Not Running Mates, Sways Voters' Choice</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrats who hope <PERSON>Sen. Lloyd Bentsen</PERSON> will
help the ticket win his home state of <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> and perhaps the
presidential election could do well to regard the fate of <PERSON>Henry
Gassaway Davis</PERSON>.
   In case anyone doesn't remember, <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> was Democrat <PERSON>Alton B.
Parker</PERSON>'s running mate when <PERSON>Parker</PERSON> ran for president against
<ORGANIZATION>Republican Teddy Roosevelt</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1904</DATE>.
   The voters chose between <PERSON>Roosevelt</PERSON> and <PERSON>Parker</PERSON>, and their choice
was Roosevelt by a 3-2 margin.
   Experts concede that the vice presidential debate in <LOCATION>Omaha</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Neb.</LOCATION>, on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> between <PERSON>Bentsen</PERSON> and Republican <PERSON>Dan Quayle</PERSON> may
make a difference, but they say the voters' final decision will
come down to a choice between the top of the tickets, Democrat
<PERSON>Michael Dukakis</PERSON> and Vice President <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON>.
   ``Unless <PERSON>Quayle</PERSON> is absolutely destroyed in the debate with
<PERSON>Bentsen</PERSON>, I don't think it will hurt <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>,'' said <PERSON>Leo Ribuffo</PERSON>, a
specialist in political history at <ORGANIZATION>George Washington University</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>.
   ``People will be looking for <PERSON>Quayle</PERSON> to blow it,'' said <PERSON>Samuel H.
Kernell</PERSON>, professor of political science at the <ORGANIZATION>University of
California</ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>. ``If he can get through the debate in a
competent fashion where he looks unexceptional, it will be a real
success for him.''
   <PERSON>Eddie Mahe Jr.</PERSON>, a Republican political consultant, said, ``I
think it is reasonable to suggest that <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON> would have won
<LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION> (<ORGANIZATION>Quayle</ORGANIZATION>'s home state) without <PERSON>Mr. Quayle</PERSON>, and with <PERSON>Mr.
Bentsen</PERSON>, <PERSON>Mike Dukakis</PERSON> is still not going to carry <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>. So you
wash that out.''
   ``I think the odds are that <PERSON>Quayle</PERSON> will have little or no effect
on the ultimate choice,'' said <PERSON>Thomas Mann</PERSON>, program director for
governmental studies at the Brookings Institution here.
   <PERSON>Elspeth Rostow</PERSON>, a political scholar at the <ORGANIZATION>Lyndon B. Johnson
School of Public Affairs</ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Texas</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Austin</LOCATION>, said
<PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s choice of <PERSON>Quayle</PERSON> ``doesn't seem to have too much effect on
the voters, at least so far.''
   ``I don't think, if indeed <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> was disposed to choose <PERSON>Quayle</PERSON> to
appeal to women, that so far it has had that effect,'' <PERSON>Ms. Rostow</PERSON>
said.
   ``I think the conventional wisdom that the selection of a
running mate is rarely decisive one way or another is absolutely
true,'' said <PERSON>Ribuffo</PERSON>.
   A survey conducted this year by the <ORGANIZATION>Hearst Corp.</ORGANIZATION> supports this
view.
   Eighteen percent of the 1,001 voters surveyed said they had
changed their minds about a presidential candidate at one time or
another because of their opinion of his running mate. Of those, <PERCENT>70
percent</PERCENT> said they voted against that ticket.
   Political experts agree that if a running mate has any effect,
he is more likely to hurt than help.
   Examples cited include President <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION>'s selection of <PERSON>Sen. Robert
Dole</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION>, who was criticized for his slashing debating style
in <DATE>1976</DATE>, and <PERSON>Walter Mondale</PERSON>'s choice of <PERSON>Geraldine Ferraro</PERSON>, who
suffered from examination of her family's finances in <DATE>1984</DATE>.
   ``Clearly in my opinion <PERSON>Bob Dole</PERSON> in <DATE>1976</DATE> in that debate (with
<PERSON>Mondale</PERSON>, <PERSON>Jimmy Carter</PERSON>'s running mate) cost <PERSON>Jerry Ford</PERSON> votes,'' <PERSON>Mahe</PERSON>
said. ``Clearly in <DATE>1984</DATE> in my opinion, <PERSON>Geraldine Ferraro</PERSON> cost
<PERSON>Walter Mondale</PERSON> votes probably.''
   In <PERSON>Richard Nixon</PERSON>'s unsuccessful campaign of <DATE>1960</DATE>, some thought
that Republican vice presidential candidate <ORGANIZATION>Henry Cabot Lodge</ORGANIZATION> hurt
the ticket's chances by pledging that <PERSON>Nixon</PERSON> would appoint a black
to the Cabinet _ a statement <PERSON>Nixon</PERSON> disavowed.
   Lodge, a former ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION>, also was
criticized for taking naps and not campaigning hard enough. ``Some
have thought that if he had used his prestige from the <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> more
effectively, <PERSON>Nixon</PERSON> might have edged out <LOCATION>Kennedy</LOCATION>,'' <PERSON>Ms. Rostow</PERSON> said.
   There are exceptions to the rule that running mates don't help
much, the experts said.
   While there is disagreement over whether Lodge hurt <PERSON>Nixon</PERSON> in
<DATE>1960</DATE>, almost everybody agrees that <PERSON>Lyndon B. Johnson</PERSON> helped Kennedy
by enabling him to carry <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>.
   ``I don't think <LOCATION>Kennedy</LOCATION> would have won without <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON>,''
<PERSON>Ribuffo</PERSON> said.
   Also, <PERSON>Ribuffo</PERSON> said, <PERSON>Mondale</PERSON> may have helped <PERSON>Carter</PERSON> win election
in <DATE>1976</DATE> by imparting legitimacy to the former <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION> governor in
the eyes of skeptical liberals.
   Then there was the running mate that Republicans chose in <DATE>1900</DATE>
to help the colorless <PERSON>William McKinley</PERSON> win a second term against
the dynamic Democrat, <PERSON>William Jennings Bryan</PERSON>. The ticket of
<ORGANIZATION>McKinley</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Roosevelt</PERSON> became known as ``the kangaroo ticket
because it had a kick in the tail,'' <PERSON>Ms. Rostow</PERSON> said.
   There haven't been many tickets in any other year, including
<DATE>1988</DATE>, with that much of a kick in the tail, the experts agree.

<HEAD>High Wind Keeps Deaf and Blind Climbers From McKinley Summit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TALKEETNA, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An international team that includes two
blind climbers, a deaf climber and an amputee nearly made it to the
top of <LOCATION>Mount McKinley</LOCATION>, but 50 mph winds forced them to turn around,
officials said <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   The group got up to at least 18,000 feet, said <PERSON>Roger Robinson</PERSON>, a
<ORGANIZATION>U.S. Park Service</ORGANIZATION> ranger. At 20,320 feet, <ORGANIZATION>Mount McKinley</ORGANIZATION> is <LOCATION>North
America</LOCATION>'s highest mountain.
   ``They've all descended. They're at 14,000 now. Indications are
they're not going back up,'' he said.
   ``They did very good considering that only about half the folks
that try McKinley make it to the top.''
   The ascent was attempted by 1,009 climbers last year; only 524
reached the summit.
   Adaptations were made for the disabled climbers.
   ``Apparently they've got ropes stretched out to the latrines when
they're at camps,'' said <PERSON>Bob Seiber</PERSON>, chief mountaineering ranger.
``They work extremely well together and develop their other senses,
I guess.''
   <PERSON>Patrick Reinhart</PERSON>, a member of the expedition and director of
<ORGANIZATION>Challenge Alaska</ORGANIZATION>, a group that helps develop recreational and sports
opportunities for disabled climbers, came up with the idea for the
ascent.
   <PERSON>Reinhart</PERSON>, who has an artificial foot, always wanted to climb
<ORGANIZATION>McKinley</ORGANIZATION>. So did <PERSON>Ross Watson</PERSON>, a Canadian member of the expedition
who lost his sight at age 12 in a pellet gun accident.
   <PERSON>Patrick Hurst</PERSON>, a 27-year-old Englishman who teaches outdoor
sports to physically disabled people, also is blind.
   Lkakpa Sonam, a Sherpa from <LOCATION>Nepal</LOCATION>, is deaf.
   In overall charge of the expedition is <PERSON>George Rooney</PERSON>, a member of
the <ORGANIZATION>American Alpine Club</ORGANIZATION> who's been up <ORGANIZATION>McKinley</ORGANIZATION> twice and tried
climbing <ORGANIZATION>Everest</ORGANIZATION> in a joint American-Polish expediton. He's also an
emergency medical technician and a specialist in mountain rescue.

<LEADPARA>  FRANKLIN-McKinley School District's new $7 million headquarters is far more
than offices. The renovated warehouse doubles as a community service center
for the largely low-income district, including a clinic for free medical care,
counseling services and even programs like Project Crackdown.;   But still, $7
million?  </LEADPARA>

<MEMO>  Editorials  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Even factoring out special costs, like structural changes to the building,
construction experts say the office space was expensive. Some teachers and
parents grumble about its comparative luxury while schools are in disrepair.; 
 And there's another problem. The district says it was told by the state that
it had to use revenue from property sales to build offices or the state would
claim the money. State officials say that's not true: Their rules encourage
districts to spend money on classrooms; offices are the last priority. And
while community services are great, the state <ORGANIZATION>Allocation Board</ORGANIZATION> would place
direct school needs first.;   The fact is Franklin-McKinley never sought to
spend this money on classrooms. The board wanted to build an education center
-- its name for the community facility -- and decided to sell excess property
to pay for it.;   <ORGANIZATION>Board</ORGANIZATION> president <ORGANIZATION>Lolita Foster</ORGANIZATION> says that when the project was
planned, starting in <DATE>1988</DATE>, the district had programs in place to renovate
schools and build new ones, relying on state grants. The education center was
to round out the district's services.;   But state funding for classroom
renovations is inadequate, and the district has <MONEY>$21 million</MONEY> in unmet needs,
waiting in line for state funding.;   There are good arguments for the
community facility. Healthy, well-adjusted children learn better. But the
district was sloppy about clearing its plans with the state, and it appears to
have spent more than necessary for the space it gained. Some of that money
could have gone into the schools.;   Some controversial features in the new
building are common in the offices of private companies; the shower in the
superintendent's office, for instance. But the question isn't whether school
workers deserve those amenities. The question is how best to spend a
district's severely limited resources.;   Somebody at Franklin-McKinley should
have thought harder about that question.  </TEXT>

Fairplex Drive will become the designation for the full length of <LOCATION>Ganesha</LOCATION>, from

<LEADPARA>  There won't be any layoffs in the Franklin-McKinley School District next year,
the district's board of trustees decided Tuesday in approving a 1991-'92
budget.;    But the district will have to cut $2.2 million from its $38
million general fund.;    Here is what the cuts, approved unanimously Tuesday,
will mean to the Franklin-McKinley community next year:  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     (check) Grants to encourage innovative teaching will be pared from <MONEY>$50,000</MONEY>
to <MONEY>$20,000</MONEY>.;    (check) The instrumental music program will be cut by a third,
going from three to two teachers.;    (check) There will be fewer classes that
mix students from different grade levels, because such classes require fewer
students and cost more than regular classes.;    (check) Schools will have to
pay the full cost of copying various printed matter, rather than having part
of this cost absorbed by the district's print shop.;    The budget approved
<DATE>Tuesday</DATE> is final, though adjustments could be made once the level of state
funding is determined.;    There was no public comment at <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>'s meeting.; 
  "We hope the state doesn't put us through any more traumas," said board
Chairwoman Lolita Foster.;    Unlike employees in other school districts,
those at Franklin-McKinley will be spared layoffs. For the time being, they
can thank the fact that the district is growing.;    Next year, predictions
call for the student population to grow by <PERCENT>2.5 percent</PERCENT>. The district hasn't
yet reached the point where the cost of educating the new students outstrips
extra state money they generate.  </TEXT>

<MEMO>  Also ran in EX4/1  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Under the proposal, scheduled for a vote <DATE>April 9</DATE>, Franklin-McKinley would
add seventh and eighth grades to <ORGANIZATION>Stonegate School</ORGANIZATION>, an elementary school in one
of its quieter residential neighborhoods. Families who live in the district,
but have left its schools, would have first claim to admission.;    At <DATE>last
Tuesday</DATE>'s meeting in a standing-room-only board room, several parents assailed
the plan as a form of economic discrimination and a vote of no confidence
against the district's two current middle schools -- <PERSON>J.W. Fair</PERSON> and
Sylvandale.;    "The decision to have a kindergarten through eighth grade at
<LOCATION>Stonegate</LOCATION> means the administration admits to rampant accusations that Fair . .
. does not have a nurturing environment, that they do not have a rigorous
academic curriculum, that they are not safe," said <PERSON>Cora Tomalinos</PERSON>, active in
the <ORGANIZATION>Parent-Teacher Association</ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION>Fair.</LOCATION>;    Franklin-McKinley board members
offered little comment at the emotionally charged meeting.;    However,
Superintendent <PERSON>Dolores Ballesteros</PERSON> and other supporters defended the plan as a
means of luring back students who've been lost to other schools, by offering
them more choices within Franklin-McKinley. They called the nationwide trend
toward schools of choice a tide that can't be turned back.;    "Choice is
here, my dears, whether you like it or not," <PERSON>Ballesteros</PERSON> told the audience of
more than 50 parents, teachers and community members who turned out despite
the rain. "My personal opinion is that a majority of our students are always
going to go to our two middle schools. But it's pretty darn important that we
get those kids who've left our district back.";    Opponents of the <LOCATION>Stonegate</LOCATION>
proposal argued that they did not object to choice but thought the choice
should be available to all district parents.;    "I have nothing against a
seventh and eighth grade at <LOCATION>Stonegate</LOCATION>," said <PERSON>Ruth Smith</PERSON>, whose son attends
<LOCATION>Stonegate</LOCATION>. But she said she opposed a plan that favors students not in the
district's schools.;    "Just because I can afford private school for my child
should not be a determining factor as to what school my child goes to," she
said.;    But first granting admission to a seventh and eighth grades at
<LOCATION>Stonegate</LOCATION> to students already in district schools would not raise any new
money for Franklin-McKinley. And that was the whole idea behind the <LOCATION>Stonegate</LOCATION>
plan.;    District administrators came up with the plan earlier this year, in
an attempt to minimize looming budget cuts. Because Gov. <PERSON>Pete Wilson</PERSON> is
proposing suspending Proposition 98, the initiative that guarantees public
schools a minimum level of funding, Franklin-McKinley faces <MONEY>$2.5 million</MONEY> in
cuts next year, or <PERCENT>9 percent</PERCENT> of what it currently spends.;    They claim that
about 125 middle school students eligible to attend Franklin-McKinley's
schools are now going elsewhere. If these students could be wooed back, the
district would get <MONEY>$350,000</MONEY> in new state revenue. After paying teachers'
salaries and other costs, that would earn the district <MONEY>$85,000</MONEY>, staff members
estimate.;    However, <PERSON>Debbie Elliott</PERSON>, registrar at <ORGANIZATION>J.W. Fair</ORGANIZATION>, said the
district had yet to offer her proof that 125 middle school students have fled
the district. At a previous meeting, she claimed the number at Fair was closer
to 10.;    Other parents argued the district had no proof the <LOCATION>Stonegate</LOCATION>
proposal would entice back the parents the district hopes to reach.;   
"They're not here, they're not voicing their opinions," said <PERSON>Dina Arata</PERSON>,
president of the <ORGANIZATION>Kennedy School Parent-Teacher Association.</ORGANIZATION>;    According to
<LOCATION>Ballesteros</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>Stonegate</LOCATION> proposal has generated interest among private
school families who heard about it by word of mouth. However, administrators
do not plan to initiate any contacts until the <LOCATION>Stonegate</LOCATION> proposal is approved,
she said.;    Under the <LOCATION>Stonegate</LOCATION> proposal, first choice would go to students
who live anywhere in the district but go to private schools or public schools
outside the district. Next in line would be those whose parents say they are
considering such a move.;    Third would come students with special needs,
such as those attending the <PERSON>Slingerland</PERSON> program at <LOCATION>Stonegate</LOCATION> for dyslexic
children. Ballesteros said the <LOCATION>Stonegate</LOCATION> proposal would be a godsend to
parents with sixth-graders in that program who fear their children will be
easily lost in the larger middle school atmosphere.;    "I have watched these
children just be decimated by the whole schooling experience," finally to meet
success in <LOCATION>Stonegate</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Slingerland</LOCATION> program, <LOCATION>Ballesteros</LOCATION> said. Many of these
parents are "very concerned about leaving that success and having their
children 'mainstreamed,' " she said.;    <PERSON>Tina Nielson</PERSON>, a parent of a dyslexic
child who went from <LOCATION>Stonegate</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Slingerland</LOCATION> to a district middle school,
agreed.;    Now all seventh- and eighth-graders in Franklin-McKinley go to the
district's two middle schools, <PERSON>J.W. Fair</PERSON> and Sylvandale.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>
   A record 916 people tackled <ORGANIZATION>Mount
McKinley</ORGANIZATION> during the mountaineering season, says the <ORGANIZATION>National Park
Service</ORGANIZATION>, which is thinking about putting another outhouse on <LOCATION>North
America</LOCATION>'s tallest mountain.
   Sanitation on the 20,320-foot mountain has been a growing
concern, said <PERSON>Ranger Roger Robinson</PERSON>.
   According to <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON>, 562 of the 916 people who registered to
climb McKinley this <DATE>spring</DATE> and <DATE>summer</DATE> reported reaching the summit.
   Last year, 817 climbers tested themselves against the mountain.
Only about a third finished the climb.
   Two people died climbing <DATE>McKinley this year</DATE>, <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> said.
   <PERSON>Don Henry</PERSON>, a 71-year-old <LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION> lawyer, this year became
the oldest person known to have made the top.
   Robinson attributed some of the increased mountaineering to
foreigners who decided attractive currency exchange rates made this
the year for the climb they had long wanted to make.
   Climbers began arriving in <DATE>April</DATE> and some waited until late
<DATE>July</DATE>, but most planned their trips for <DATE>May</DATE> and <DATE>June</DATE>.
   ``We're trying to get more people to come in <DATE>July</DATE>,'' <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON>
said. Rangers attempting to deal with the environmental effects of
increased activity want use of the mountain to be spread out.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Park Service</ORGANIZATION> asks climbers to use plastic bags for human
waste and put the bags in crevasses, but officials don't know how
many comply, <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> said. There are two latrines on <ORGANIZATION>McKinley</ORGANIZATION>, one
two-thirds of the way up the peak. The <ORGANIZATION>Park Service</ORGANIZATION> hopes to
install an outhouse at 17,000 feet next year.

<TEXT>
   Four years after record-breaking cold forced an
indoor inaugural, <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON> must cope with the vagaries of
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> weather in planning for his presidential oath-taking.
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s inaugural committee is making contingency plans, including
a swearing-in ceremony in the <LOCATION>Capitol Rotunda</LOCATION>, in the event of
weather disruptions.
   While meteorologists say it is too soon to make a prediction for
<DATE>Friday</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Inauguration Day</ORGANIZATION>, the 30-day weather forecast for <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>
in <DATE>January</DATE> called for a <PERCENT>55 percent</PERCENT> chance of above normal
temperatures and dryer than normal conditions for the month.
   Does that mean <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s inauguration won't be plagued by a driving
rain like that which nearly washed away <PERSON>Franklin D. Roosevelt</PERSON>'s
second swearing-in, in <DATE>1937</DATE>?
   Or a snowstorm such as nearly buried <PERSON>William Howard Taft</PERSON> in <DATE>1909</DATE>?
   Or perhaps a raw, cloudy day like that in <DATE>1841</DATE> when <PERSON>William Henry
Harrison</PERSON> took office without hat or overcoat? Harrison caught a cold
that turned into pneumonia, killing him after but a month in office.
   President <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>'s <DATE>1985</DATE> inaugural ceremonies were moved inside
when 10-degree temperatures and winds of 17 mph put the wind chill
factor at 16 below zero.
   Such history notwithstanding, a study of climate shows the
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> weather on <DATE>Jan. 20</DATE> is often, but not always, mild.
   Weather historian <PERSON>Patrick Hughes</PERSON> details the effects of the
elements on inaugurations in the <DATE>December</DATE> issue of ``Weatherwise''
magazine. In his study he notes that average weather for the date is
44 degrees Fahrenheit, and normally only enough rain or snow falls
to wet the pavement.
   The date for the inauguration was changed in the <DATE>1930s</DATE>, when it
was moved up from <DATE>March 4</DATE>. <DATE>Jan. 20</DATE> was picked after a study of
weather records showed it to be usually mild, for that time of year.
   Roosevelt's wet and chilled ceremony in <DATE>1937</DATE> was the first to be
held in <DATE>January</DATE>, and criticism promptly followed.
   Sen. <PERSON>George W. Norris</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION>, who spearheaded the change,
warned critics to wait until <DATE>March 4</DATE> to see what the weather would
be like then, before criticizing him for the change.
   ``It was, of course, a beautiful day _ sunny with a high
temperature of 67 degrees, unusually warm for that date,'' <PERSON>Hughes</PERSON>
observes.
   Perhaps the most practical approach to inaugural weather came
from <PERSON>Harry S. Truman</PERSON>. Upon receiving a formal invitation to his own
swearing-in ceremony, <PERSON>Truman</PERSON> wrote across it: ``Weather Permitting,
I hope to be present.'' It was a chilly 38 degrees and windy that
day, but the sun was out and <PERSON>Truman</PERSON> was there.
   Official weather records were not kept at the time, but
historians recorded it as a cool and clear day in <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION> when
<PERSON>George Washington</PERSON> became the first president on <DATE>April 30, 1789</DATE>.
   Four years later the event was moved to <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> and to <DATE>March
4</DATE>, as determined by <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>, and the weather was listed as
``pleasant'' for the start of <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>'s second term. It was
``fair'' in the <LOCATION>City of Brotherly Love</LOCATION> when <PERSON>John Adams</PERSON> took office
in <DATE>1797</DATE>.
   After that the ceremonies moved to the new capital city,
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, where it was ``mild and beautiful'' for <PERSON>Thomas Jefferson</PERSON>
in <DATE>1801</DATE> and ``fair'' for the start of his second term in <DATE>1895</DATE>.
   <PERSON>James Madison</PERSON>'s two terms both started in weather listed by
historians as ``probably fair.''
   Here is a rundown of subsequent presidents and the weather
attending their inaugurations, as recorded in the book ``American
Weather Stories:``
   _<PERSON>James Monroe</PERSON>, warm and sunny in <DATE>1817</DATE>, snow and 28 degrees in
<DATE>1821</DATE>.
   _<PERSON>John Quincy Adams</PERSON>, 47 degres and rain, <DATE>1825</DATE>.

<LEADPARA>  The board of the Franklin-McKinley School District reached a compromise last
week on a controversial proposal to add seventh and eighth grades to Stonegate
Elementary School as an alternative to the district's two middle schools.;   
Under the agreement, the district will add a seventh grade to Stonegate next
year. If the pilot program succeeds, an eighth grade will be added in
1992-'93, and two other elementary schools will also add the grade levels. To
help ensure equal access to all parents in the multilingual community, the
district will advertise the option in English, Spanish, Vietnamese and
Cambodian.  </LEADPARA>

STONEGATE GETTING 7TH-GRADERS SOON  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Also ran in EX4/1  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Criteria for choosing students to fill the two grades remain up in the air.
The board left that issue up staff members, with input from a board
representative. However, Superintendent <PERSON>Dolores Ballesteros</PERSON> promised that all
students will be given a fair chance.;    "This (compromise) nowhere near
resembles what was originally being planned" in <DATE>February</DATE>, board member
<PERSON>Francisco Dominguez</PERSON> said after the meeting.;    The original proposal included
adding seventh and eighth grades to only <ORGANIZATION>Stonegate Elementary School</ORGANIZATION>. And it
suggested giving admission priority to families who had removed their children
from district middle schools to enroll them elsewhere.;    The idea was
persuade these families to keep their children in Franklin-McKinley. But the
proposal generated passionate opposition from those who took it as an insult
to the district's two middle schools, <PERSON>J.W. Fair</PERSON> and Sylvandale. They said
those schools had suffered from a bad image for years, and that if there were
indeed problems with them, the district should fix them rather than offering
an alternative.;    The compromise passed, 4-1, last week after <PERSON>Dominguez</PERSON> and
<ORGANIZATION>Pearle Woodall</ORGANIZATION>, two board members who opposed the original plan, changed their
votes. <PERSON>Robin Rogers</PERSON> cast the lone no vote.;    <PERSON>Dominguez</PERSON> and <PERSON>Woodall</PERSON> said they
changed their position when a district survey taken in <DATE>May</DATE> showed <PERCENT>70 percent</PERCENT>
of respondents supported the kindergarten through eighth grade concept.
"There's been a need expressed by parents," <PERSON>Woodall</PERSON> said.;    About 2,300
parents in the district of 10,000 students responded to the survey.;   
<PERSON>Dominguez</PERSON> added that the equal-access provision in the compromise also
influenced his decision.;    After the board agreed on the plan, it heard
about another choice in the offing. Starting this <DATE>fall</DATE>, parents who teach
their children at home may enroll them in Franklin-McKinley. For each
home-schooler, the district would receive about <MONEY>$2,800</MONEY> in state attendance
money. It would in turn pay parents <MONEY>$1,000</MONEY> per child for instructional
materials.;    Staff members decided to offer the option after learning that
home-schoolers living in Franklin-McKinley's area are enrolling in the
<ORGANIZATION>Cupertino Union School District</ORGANIZATION> to take advantage of a similar program. The
option benefits home-schooling parents by giving them a chance to network with
each other, Director of Curriculum <PERSON>Sandra Will</PERSON> told the board.;    Including
home-schoolers extends a district policy that already allows disabled
students, students whose families are on long vacations, and others with
special needs to be taught at home, Will said.;    In other business, board
members considered a proposed <MONEY>$2.2 million</MONEY> in cuts to the district's <MONEY>$38
million</MONEY> budget.;    Like school districts throughout <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>,
Franklin-McKinley is preparing for the cuts because of the state fiscal
crisis.;    The board's final vote on Franklin-McKinley's budget is scheduled
for <DATE>June 25</DATE>.  </TEXT>

<P>
Can a gumshoe learn the soft shoe? Can a deep-dyed lawman lighten up and make 
you laugh? 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Braden McKinley</PERSON>, chief investigator for the <LOCATION>Ventura County</LOCATION> district attorney, 
submitted to questioning on the subject this week. His debut in musical comedy 
was central to the inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
McKinley is cast in the role of Hucklebee -- a slightly inept patriarchal type 
-- in "The Fantasticks," which is playing this week at the <ORGANIZATION>Ventura College 
Theatre</ORGANIZATION>. He was a little surprised, he said, to have landed the part. 
</P>
<P>
"I am probably the least talented of any of the crew. Maybe I have more 
real-life theatrics," the investigator said. "I've probably been doing it all 
my life -- I just didn't realize it." 
</P>
<P>
A quarter of a century in law enforcement may seem incompatible with song and 
dance -- but then, <ORGANIZATION>McKinley</ORGANIZATION> isn't a typical cop. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to overseeing a staff of 36 detectives, he is an ordained deacon of 
the Catholic church, where, among other duties, he performs marriages and 
teaches catechism. 
</P>
<P>
He wasn't raised as a Catholic. It's something he discovered during an 
introspective six years with the sheriff's homicide bureau. The work, which 
perhaps has more often caused people to lose faith than gain it, affected him a 
little differently than some of his colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
"There had to be more to life," he said "than what I saw on the autopsy table." 
</P>
<P>
McKinley, now 47, came from coal mining country -- <LOCATION>Franklin</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pa</LOCATION>. Just out of 
high school he went into the <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION>, where he learned to repair Diesel engines. 
When his tour was up in <DATE>1965</DATE>, he came to <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> to work in the defense 
industry. He had already married his high school sweetheart, <PERSON>Nancy</PERSON>, and their 
first son was a few months old. 
</P>
<P>
But, he says, when he arrived he found the Omnibus Crime Bill had just been 
signed, pouring federal dollars into police budgets. All the jobs offered 
seemed to be behind a badge. 
</P>
<P>
"I was not really sure I was suited for law enforcement," <PERSON>McKinley</PERSON> said, "I was 
very much an introvert." 
</P>
<P>
But he made up his mind to do it, undaunted by the police recruiter who was 
behind a desk after losing an eye and an ear in a hatchet attack. 
</P>
<P>
A few years later the lawman didn't hesitate to become the first non-military 
bomb technician in the Ventura-Santa Barbara-San <PERSON>Luis Obispo</PERSON> area. (He trained 
at the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION>'s Redstone Arsenal in <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION>, and eventually was appointed 
commander of the sheriff's bomb team, a post he held for 15 years.) 
</P>
<P>
And the fact that he had no expertise in riding didn't stop <ORGANIZATION>McKinley</ORGANIZATION> from 
volunteering to develop and train the mounted sheriff's patrol, which is still 
used for crowd control. 
</P>
<P>
"I always wanted to be a Western sheriff on horseback," <PERSON>McKinley</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
It's a little like his decision to break into theater with only a semester of 
acting under his belt. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, <ORGANIZATION>McKinley</ORGANIZATION> made another stage appearance three years ago in a work 
titled "Saints and Sinners," put on by his church, <ORGANIZATION>Sacred Heart</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Saticoy</LOCATION>. He 
was an understudy catapulted onto center stage when the emcee became ill. He 
got the itch. 
</P>
<P>
He ignored it until this <DATE>spring</DATE>. Then his 15-year-old daughter, <PERSON>Julie</PERSON>, youngest 
of the three <PERSON>McKinley</PERSON> children, asked him to drive her to an acting class at 
the college. He figured he might as well sign up for the heck of it. Director 
<PERSON>Jay Varela</PERSON> gave him the part. 
</P>
<P>
"He has a fatherly quality that is very, very nice," the director said, "There 
were others who knew a lot more about singing, but they didn't look right." 
</P>
<P>
Varela has been pleased with <ORGANIZATION>McKinley</ORGANIZATION>'s dedication. "It's as if he were a 
17-year-old," he said. "He gets here early -- he drills -- he does absolutely 
whatever you tell him to do. He's had to learn a lot." 
</P>
<P>
For his part, <ORGANIZATION>McKinley</ORGANIZATION> is frankly in love with the play -- a Romeo-and-Juliet 
story with an upbeat ending. Beyond the comedy, he said, "It's a great 
metaphor." 
</P>
<P>
Demonstrating his depth of feeling, he recites lines from the play's hit tune, 
"Try To Remember": "Deep in <DATE>December</DATE>, it's nice to remember, without a hurt the 
heart is hollow. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
He might even take up acting full time, he said, after his retirement. It could 
be used for something beyond entertainment -- perhaps the police department's 
drug and alcohol education program, DARE. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, "It is a great stress-reliever," he said, "It transposes you 
into somewhere you are not. But it's more than a temporary escape. It's got to 
feed the memory and feed the dream." 
</P>
<P>
* WHERE AND WHEN: "The Fantasticks" continues its run at the <ORGANIZATION>Ventura College 
Theatre on Loma Vista</ORGANIZATION> between Day and <LOCATION>Ashwood</LOCATION> tonight, <DATE>Friday</DATE> and <DATE>Saturday</DATE> at <TIME>8 
p.m</TIME>. A <DATE>Sunday</DATE> matinee is at <TIME>3 p.m</TIME>. The box office opens half an hour before 
show time. General admission seats are <MONEY>$10</MONEY>; <MONEY>$7</MONEY> for seniors, students and staff;

   Despite the good news from the leading economic
indicators, the economy is not out of the doldrums. The
question asked last summer, namely whether by raising taxes
George Bush was repeating the policy mistakes of Herbert
Hoover, has only been deferred, not answered. One parallel
between the two presidents is a stiffening of antitrust
policy after years of leniency.
   The Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission
filed relatively few antitrust actions under Coolidge. His
antitrust authorities substituted consultation for
litigation, in particular by providing for advance clearance
of mergers and trade association agreements. Although its
legality was then questionable, pre-clearance of mergers is a
sound idea that was finally written into law in 1975. Until
then, merging parties did not know where they stood until a
suit was filed, which often occurred five or 10 years after
the merger. With antitrust's loose cannons safely tied down,
the 1920s, like the 1980s, were marked by a merger boom and
economic growth.

<TEXT>
   But on <DATE>Friday</DATE>, <DATE>Oct. 25, 1929</DATE>, the <PERSON>Hoover</PERSON> administration's
attorney general, <PERSON>William Mitchell</PERSON>, announced in an address
at the <ORGANIZATION>American Bar Association</ORGANIZATION>'s annual banquet that the
<ORGANIZATION>Department of Justice</ORGANIZATION> would deal "vigorously with every
violation of the antitrust laws." He also revealed that the
department had not given clearance to a single proposed
merger since the administration had been inaugurated in
<DATE>March</DATE>, and that it would abandon the practice altogether. The
Dow Jones average, which had fallen <PERCENT>6%</PERCENT> on the preceding
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, dropped another <PERCENT>13%</PERCENT> on the <DATE>Monday</DATE> and <PERCENT>12%</PERCENT> on the
<DATE>Tuesday</DATE> following <PERSON>Mitchell</PERSON>'s speech.
   <PERSON>Mitchell</PERSON>'s tough talk was soon backed up with lawsuits,
both against large mergers, notably in the film industry, and
against a string of trade association agreements that had
been approved by the <PERSON>Coolidge</PERSON> antitrust authorities.
High-profile cases in early <DATE>1930</DATE> against a group of major oil
companies and against a patent cross-licensing agreement
between <ORGANIZATION>RCA</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Westinghouse</ORGANIZATION> helped certify the <PERSON>Hoover</PERSON>
administration's anti-big-business credentials. The economy,
which had already begun to slump, slid into an ever deeper
recession that was aggravated by banking panics and misguided
<ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION> actions beginning in the <DATE>fall of 1930</DATE>.
   The <PERSON>Hoover</PERSON> administration was making a classic Republican
mistake. Teddy <PERSON>Roosevelt</PERSON>'s politicized antitrust crusade
against <ORGANIZATION>Standard Oil</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Du Pont</ORGANIZATION> and other large firms coincided
with the Panic of <DATE>1907</DATE>. Publicly, <PERSON>Roosevelt</PERSON> dismissed
widespread charges that his policies could have been
responsible for the Panic, and disingenuously wondered "why
there should be this belief on Wall Street that I am a
wild-eyed revolutionist." But the agile hero of <LOCATION>San Juan Hill</LOCATION>
soon recognized that the better part of valor was caution,
and he suspended his aggressive antitrust policies as the
<DATE>1908</DATE> election approached.
   Roosevelt's hand-picked successor, <PERSON>William Howard Taft</PERSON>,
took up the antitrust cudgel in <DATE>1910</DATE>, when he attempted to
dismember <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Steel and other large companies. Business
again complained that antitrust was killing the economy. The
guileless <PERSON>Taft</PERSON> admitted that enforcement of the Sherman Act
"may make business halt," but vowed to "enforce that law or
die in the attempt." The words were prophetic. Roosevelt
entered the <DATE>1912</DATE> presidential contest as the pro-business
candidate, and the Republicans -- badly split between
<PERSON>Roosevelt</PERSON> and Taft -- handed the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> to <PERSON>Woodrow
Wilson</PERSON>, the first Democratic president in 20 years.
   <PERSON>Richard Nixon</PERSON> followed the Hoover pattern. The Dow peaked
after the Democrats lost the <DATE>1968</DATE> election, but it fell
steadily over the next 18 months amid threats by antitrust
officials of a sustained increase in the number of antitrust
lawsuits. In the election year of 1972 <PERSON>Mr. Nixon</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>Antitrust
Division</ORGANIZATION> broke the record set by <ORGANIZATION>FDR</ORGANIZATION>'s trustbusters in <DATE>1941</DATE>
and filed 72 cases. <PERSON>Mr. Nixon</PERSON>'s attack on Big Business
included lengthy and expensive cases against the major cereal
companies, <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>AT&amp;T</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Xerox</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>ITT</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Du Pont</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>General Foods</ORGANIZATION>.
   Those Republican presidents who adopted a less stringent
policy, were rewarded handsomely for it. Antitrust
enforcement has reached low-water marks three times in the
hundred years since the Sherman Act was signed in <DATE>1890</DATE>:
during the presidencies of <ORGANIZATION>McKinley</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Coolidge</PERSON> and <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>.
Inflation-adjusted per-capita GNP grew at <PERCENT>2.5%</PERCENT> over those 19
years, as compared to an average of <PERCENT>1.6%</PERCENT> in the other 81
years of the century.
   <PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON> is under pressure to imitate the examples of
<ORGANIZATION>Taft</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Hoover</PERSON> and <PERSON>Nixon</PERSON> rather than <ORGANIZATION>McKinley</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Coolidge</PERSON> and
<PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>. While he has held fast on some fronts, he has caved
in on others. For example, the <ORGANIZATION>House of Representatives</ORGANIZATION>
strongly endorsed a bill last <DATE>spring</DATE> that would have
undermined the ability of manufacturers to control how their
products are distributed. <PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON> threatened to veto the
bill. His threat had the long-term interest of consumers on
its side. Companies like <ORGANIZATION>Apple Computer</ORGANIZATION> are eager to keep
their products out of mail order and discount channels
because their ability to compete depends on a well-developed
network of dealers who provide customer support.
   The <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration's hostility to mergers, on the
other hand, shows that <PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON> can't kick all the old, bad,
Republican habits. The ostensible reason for blocking some
mergers is the threat of monopoly and high prices from
increased concentration, but it's clear that <PERSON>Pabst</PERSON>'s
complaints and not consumer interests lay behind efforts to
block <ORGANIZATION>Coors</ORGANIZATION>' acquisition of <ORGANIZATION>Stroh's</ORGANIZATION>. Not one sliver of
evidence exists that the permissive <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> merger policies
hurt consumers. Even the airline industry, which might be
trotted out to give mixed support for tighter merger
enforcement, is a flawed example: A ban on mergers would
simply have led to restructuring by the bankruptcy of some
airlines and the internal growth by others.
   The jury is still out on the effects of mergers and
restructurings on efficiency, but it would be foolhardy to
imagine that interference with an active market in corporate
assets on the part of the two antitrust agencies on
<LOCATION>Pennsylvania Avenue</LOCATION> will help matters.
   Historically, merger waves and good times go together, but
it would be risky to say which was cause and which was
effect. "Be strong" is cheap advice. <PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON> has shown that
he can wage war, but if he wants to cash in his military
victory in next year's election, he also needs to show that
he's a winner in peacetime. A century of Republican
experience with antitrust suggests that he should keep his
antitrust hounds on a short leash.

<TEXT>     Perhaps it's a means of preserving a cultural institution that is bent on
its own destruction. Whatever the reason, if you are holiday shopping for
someone who loves the old shows and even the new, you can find some wonderful
recordings -- and at a mere fraction of the cost of seeing a current musical.;
  Seek and ye shall find gold. Here are reviews of some of the best recorded
musicals out right now.;   Note that all the shows discussed here, except the
recent musical "Assassins," deal with the theater itself. They are shows about
show business, something Broadway does exceedingly well. "A Chorus Line," not
reviewed, is a major example.;   "Assassins" turned the lives of accused,
attempted, and convicted assassins into a musical -- and was a controversial
failure this year off-Broadway.;   'Show Boat';   Conductor/arranger <PERSON>John
McGlinn</PERSON> and <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>EMI Records</ORGANIZATION> have created a whole new musical theater
industry: the concert recordings of major musicals from a historical
perspective.;   "Show Boat" was the beginning in <DATE>1988</DATE>. McGlinn assembled an
impressive cast and produced the full score of this <DATE>1927</DATE> <PERSON>Jerome Kern/Oscar
Hammerstein</PERSON> II musical, based on the novel by <PERSON>Edna Ferber.</PERSON>;   Full score means
this album contains not only the Broadway score from the show's <DATE>1927</DATE> run, but
songs, underscoring and other music that were deleted during the show's tryout
period on the road.;   <PERSON>McGlinn</PERSON> even found and recorded material written during
the planning stages of the show, most of which was discarded before rehearsals
began. In addition, the album includes songs written for the <DATE>1928</DATE> London
production and the <DATE>1946</DATE> revival, plus three songs written expressly for a
<ORGANIZATION>Universal</ORGANIZATION> film adaptation in <DATE>1936.</DATE>;   Songs that were drastically cut are
recorded in both the cut and lengthier versions. And in order to display
<PERSON>Kern</PERSON>'s lovely underscoring (music played during dialogue) for the show, much
dialogue is also recorded on this extensive album.;   Up until <DATE>1982</DATE>, the
manuscript of the full score, in the hands of orchestrator <PERSON>Robert Russell
Bennett</PERSON>, had been presumed lost. But it was found in a <ORGANIZATION>Warner Bros.</ORGANIZATION> music
storage warehouse in <LOCATION>Secaucus</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>;   Listening to this great American
musical -- with original dialogue restored -- is a remarkably authentic
experience. Using <PERSON>Russell</PERSON>'s original orchestrations, the <LOCATION>London Sinfonietta</LOCATION>,
conduced by <PERSON>McGlinn</PERSON>, produces a rich sound yet with the inflections of musical
theater, not symphony.;   <PERSON>Teresa Stratas</PERSON> as <PERSON>Julie</PERSON> offers lovely, full-bodied
renditions of such great songs as "Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man" and "Bill." As
<ORGANIZATION>Magnolia</ORGANIZATION>, soprano <ORGANIZATION>Frederica Von Stade</ORGANIZATION> makes a delightful contrast in the
beautiful ballad "Make Believe.";   But it is the scoring of some of the new
material as arranged here, "Mis'ry's Comin' 'Round" first sung by <PERSON>Karla Burns</PERSON>
as <PERSON>Queenie</PERSON>, and "It's Getting Hotter in the North," a dropped song sung by <PERSON>Von
Stade as Kim</PERSON>, a character all but written out of the Broadway show, that make
this recording especially exciting.;   <PERSON>Bruce Hubbard</PERSON>, as <PERSON>Joe</PERSON>, handles "Ol' Man
River" well but not notably so.;   <PERSON>Kern</PERSON> may well have been the most gifted
composer the Broadway stage ever heard. His music is voluptuous, hugely
melodic yet sprightly when it needs to be. <PERSON>George Gershwin</PERSON> may have done him
one better in "Porgy and Bess," but you'll start an interesting debate on
that.;   <ORGANIZATION>Hammerstein</ORGANIZATION>'s lyrics are becoming more dated every year, yet his
simple, heartfelt empathy with his characters still shines. His wit in "Life
Upon the Wicked Stage" is charming, and his powerful lyrics for "Ol' Man
River" are still moving, 64 years later.;   The cassette-tape recording, under
the <ORGANIZATION>EMI Digital</ORGANIZATION> label and including a 134-page book of dialogue, libretto,
history and photos, sells for <MONEY>$17.95</MONEY> and that's a huge bargain. The CD is
priced at <MONEY>$44.99</MONEY>.;   'Kiss Me, <PERSON>Kate</PERSON>';   <PERSON>Cole Porter</PERSON> wrote a terrific song
called "It Was Great Fun the First Time" for "Kiss Me, Kate" in <DATE>1948</DATE>. Then,
during rehearsals, the song was replaced by "Wunderbar," and it pretty much
disappeared.;   <PERSON>McGlinn</PERSON> does not let anything from a Broadway show disappear,
and it is part of this recording of the great <PERSON>Porter</PERSON> show, based on
<ORGANIZATION>Shakespeare</ORGANIZATION>'s "The Taming of the Shrew.";   <PERSON>Porter</PERSON> almost disappeared himself
in the eight years prior to "Kiss Me, <PERSON>Kate</PERSON>." <PERSON>Porter</PERSON> was a man of the <DATE>'30s</DATE>,
reflecting the posture of the sophisticated rich looking askance at the
depressing times. <PERSON>Porter</PERSON> wrote "<LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> Hattie" in <DATE>1940</DATE>, then flubbed with
"Seven Lively Arts" in <DATE>1944</DATE> and "Around the World" in <DATE>1946</DATE>. He seemed
finished.;   But librettists <PERSON>Sam and Bella Spewack</PERSON> thought a witty adaptation
of <ORGANIZATION>Shakespeare</ORGANIZATION>'s "Shrew" would be right up his alley. And they brought <PERSON>Porter</PERSON>
back late in his career to write what was probably his best Broadway show.;  
<PERSON>McGlinn</PERSON>'s conducting and direction are again superb, though I quarrel with the
casting of <PERSON>Josephine Barstow</PERSON> as <PERSON>Lilli Vanessi</PERSON> (Katharine in "Shrew"). Her
singing is far too operatic to suit this score and its witty lyrics. <PERSON>Kim
Criswell</PERSON> as <PERSON>Lois Lane</PERSON> (<LOCATION>Bianca</LOCATION>) is also somewhat stuffy.;   The show, which was
an immediate Broadway hit, winning five Tony Awards, includes such memorable
songs as "Another Op'nin', Another Show," "So in Love," "Wunderbar," and
"Always True to You (<PERSON>Darlin</PERSON>') in My Fashion.";   Then there are the songs
dropped in rehearsal, which on this album include "It Was Great Fun the First
Time" (too bitter, the producers thought) and "A Woman's Career" (which would
make feminists riot if sung today), and "What Does Your Servant Dream About?"
Both the song and the character who sings it were dropped.;   The album,
produced by <ORGANIZATION>EMI Digital</ORGANIZATION> on two cassettes and selling for about <MONEY>$17.95</MONEY>,
includes an 86-page booklet of libretto, history and an interview with
<PERSON>Patricia Morison</PERSON>, who starred in the Broadway original with <PERSON>Alfred Drake</PERSON>. The
CD costs <MONEY>$31.99</MONEY>. It's less ambitious than "Show Boat" but still a treat.;  
<PERSON>McGlinn</PERSON> has two other full-score recordings on the market now. There's "Annie
Get Your Gun," the <PERSON>Irving Berlin</PERSON> hit, which was released a couple of months
ago, also on <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON>Cole Porter</PERSON>'s "Anything Goes," which is even newer.;  
'The Will <ORGANIZATION>Rogers Follies</ORGANIZATION>';   This is the hit musical that opened last <DATE>spring</DATE>
and is still on <LOCATION>Broadway</LOCATION>, with a score composed by <PERSON>Cy Coleman</PERSON> (music) and
<PERSON>Betty Comden</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Adolph Green</ORGANIZATION> (lyrics). <PERSON>Peter Stone</PERSON> wrote the book.;   Though
you don't get all the feathered costumes and pulchritude of the Broadway stage
show on the <ORGANIZATION>Columbia Records</ORGANIZATION> release, you do get a fine appreciation of the
show's music.;   This show clearly isn't a classic. There are few really high
points. "Willamania" gets played a lot, and it is a tuneful, upbeat melody,
but like most of the music in the show, it's lyrically flat.;   <PERSON>Keith
Carradine</PERSON>'s vocals display the <ORGANIZATION>Will Rogers</ORGANIZATION> charm that has kept this show
going. His "Never Met a Man I Didn't Like," in an easy-going folk-songish
baritone, seems more tolerable on record than it did on stage. "Give a Man
Enough Rope" is another pleasant song sung by Carradine.;   But <PERSON>Dee Hoty</PERSON> as
<PERSON>Betty Blake</PERSON> is just about lost on the record and, of course, you only hear the
beautiful girls, who have little to sing anyway.;   In contrast to <LOCATION>Broadway</LOCATION>'s
rich history, this is a mediocre little show, but thanks to
director/choreographer <PERSON>Tommy Tune</PERSON> (whose dances can't be put on record) and
the total lack of competition, it's one of today's Broadway winners. The
cassette tape is priced at <MONEY>$9.95</MONEY>, the CD at <MONEY>$14.99</MONEY>.;   'Follies';   <PERSON>Stephen
Sondheim</PERSON>'s infinitely more enthralling "Follies" is available now in the
concert version given at <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Avery Fisher Hall</PERSON> in <DATE>1985.</DATE>;   The
recording, produced by <PERSON>Thomas Z. Shepard</PERSON> for RCA/Ariola International,
showcases an exhilarating musical as sung by a marvelous cast. As <PERSON>Sondheim</PERSON>
continues to grow in stature, "Follies" may go down as his most accessible
show, even though it, like most of the <PERSON>Sondheim</PERSON> repertoire, originally had
trouble finding an audience in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. The show played a little more than a
year.;   This concert version features the great <PERSON>Barbara Cook</PERSON> bringing down
the house with "Losing My Mind," <PERSON>Elaine Stritch</PERSON>'s delightfully sardonic
"Broadway Baby," <PERSON>Lee Remick</PERSON>'s bitter "Could I Leave You?" and <PERSON>Carol Burnett</PERSON>'s
triumphant "I'm Still Here." All of these numbers were followed (as you can
hear) by cheers of approval. <PERSON>Mandy Patinkin</PERSON> and <PERSON>George Hearn</PERSON> are outstanding
in their numbers as well.;   This album also includes a libretto booklet that
will help you appreciate the sophisticated brilliance of <ORGANIZATION>Sondheim</ORGANIZATION>'s lyrics.
The choral work and underscoring, as performed by the <LOCATION>New York Philharmonic</LOCATION>
led by <PERSON>Paul Gemignani</PERSON>, makes this a special experience. Oh, to have been in
<PERSON>Fisher Hall</PERSON> when this was recorded. The cassette is <MONEY>$17.95</MONEY>, the CD <MONEY>$31.99</MONEY>.;  
'Assassins';   <PERSON>Sondheim</PERSON> doesn't handle commonplace themes. This show, with an
original book by <PERSON>John Weidman</PERSON>, brings together a handful of American
presidential assassins and would-be assassins in a sort of cheering section
for their version of the American dream.;   It's a novel approach to a
musical, and some of <PERSON>Sondheim</PERSON>'s lyrics are as fascinating as ever. But this is
a dour show. Its intellectual pretensions are unredeemed by any charm. The
whole affair fails from sheer blackness.;   Nevertheless, the cast is in fine
voice, making for a first-class album. Among the assassins -- accused,
convicted or would-be -- are <PERSON>Jace Alexander</PERSON> as <PERSON>Lee Harvey Oswald</PERSON>, <PERSON>Victor
Garber</PERSON> as <PERSON>John Wilkes Booth</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Debra Monk</ORGANIZATION> as <PERSON>Sara Jane Moore</PERSON>, <PERSON>Greg Germann</PERSON> as
<PERSON>John Hinckley</PERSON>, <PERSON>Annie Golden</PERSON> as <PERSON>Lynette</PERSON> "Squeaky" <PERSON>Fromme</PERSON> (who tried to kill
President Ford) and <PERSON>Terrence Mann</PERSON> as <PERSON>Leon Czolgosz</PERSON> (who assassinated President
McKinley). There are others.;   <PERSON>Michael Starobin</PERSON> orchestrated the show and
served as musical supervisor. The 33 musicians who make up the orchestra give
the score a body it lacked in the <LOCATION>Playwrights Horizon</LOCATION> production in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>,
where the band numbered three.;   RCA Victor recorded the show after its brief
run earlier this year. If you buy the CD (<MONEY>$13.99</MONEY>), you can get a 36-page
booklet by mail which includes libretto and color photos. Or you can get the
<ORGANIZATION>Theater Communications Group</ORGANIZATION> paperback for <MONEY>$9.95</MONEY>. The cassette sells for
<MONEY>$9.95</MONEY>.;   Other shows;   Other new shows available these days include the
<LOCATION>London</LOCATION> recording of the <PERSON>John Kander</PERSON> and <PERSON>Fred Ebb</PERSON> show "70 Girls 70" and a new
"<PERSON>Joseph</PERSON> and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat," the <PERSON>Andrew Lloyd Webber</PERSON> show
starring <PERSON>Jason Donovan</PERSON>, on <ORGANIZATION>Polydor/Really Useful Records</ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION>ShowMusic Magazine</ORGANIZATION>,

<TEXT>
   A Japanese climber became the first
person to die on <DATE>Mount McKinley this year</DATE> after he was stranded
without a tent for two days at the 19,000-foot level, authorities
said.
   Rescuers believe they were within 200 feet of <PERSON>Hairoaki Ito</PERSON> when
he died <DATE>Sunday</DATE>.
   Ito and a companion had become separated from five other
climbers in their party, most of whom had reached the summit
<DATE>Saturday</DATE>, said <PERSON>Bob Seibert</PERSON>, chief mountaineering ranger for the
<ORGANIZATION>National Park Service</ORGANIZATION>.
   The cause of death was not immediately known, but <PERSON>Seibert</PERSON> said
the 38-year-old <PERSON>Ito</PERSON> was suffering from exposure and altitude
sickness.
   ``To be exposed to Denali weather at that elevation is just
asking for it,'' said <PERSON>Renny Jackson</PERSON>, a ranger who had descended
<DATE>Saturday</DATE> after spending 24 days on the mountain. Denali is the
native Alaskan name for <ORGANIZATION>McKinley</ORGANIZATION>.
   Ito died as his fellow climber was trying to reach him with an
air-dropped oxygen bottle and as a climbing party that included
physicians was scrambling up the mountain.
   Ito, from <LOCATION>Hyogo</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, was the first to die on the mountain
since three British climbers were killed last fall. More than 40
people have died on <LOCATION>Mount McKinley</LOCATION>, the continent's tallest peak at
20,320 feet.

<TEXT>
   ``It is the tradition of our politics, and a
very poor tradition, that the vice-presidency is a shelf,'' <ORGANIZATION>Henry
Cabot Lodge</ORGANIZATION> wrote to <PERSON>Theodore Roosevelt</PERSON>. ``It ought to be, and
there is no reason why it should not be, a stepping stone.''
   Pretty slippery stepping stone.
   Roosevelt did not get to put Lodge's theory to the test. After
being elected vice president in <DATE>1900</DATE> he was catapulted into the
<ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> by the assassination of President <PERSON>William McKinley</PERSON>.
   Every vice president who has had the chance to in the <DATE>last 60
years</DATE>, however, has tried for the presidency while holding the No.
2 position.
   So far, they have all failed.
   <PERSON>Alben Barkley</PERSON>, <PERSON>Harry Truman</PERSON>'s vice president in <DATE>1952</DATE>, could not
even win his party's nomination. He was forced to withdraw in the
face of labor opposition.
   <PERSON>Richard Nixon</PERSON>, as <PERSON>Dwight Eisenhower</PERSON>'s vice president in <DATE>1960</DATE>,
captured the Republican presidential nomination easily but lost to
<PERSON>John F. Kennedy</PERSON>, in a campaign in which he got little help from
<PERSON>Eisenhower</PERSON>. He had to wait eight years to win the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> on
his own.
   The candidate he defeated was <PERSON>Hubert H. Humphrey</PERSON>, running while
serving as vice president under <PERSON>Lyndon B. Johnson</PERSON> at the height of
the unpopular <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> war.
   Now <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON> is trying it. If he wins on <DATE>Nov. 8</DATE>, he will be
the first vice president to succeed to the presidency by election
since <ORGANIZATION>Martin Van Buren</ORGANIZATION> followed <PERSON>Andrew Jackson</PERSON> into the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION>
in <DATE>1836</DATE>.
   Political scientists and professional political strategists say
that although <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> is doing better than most, vice presidents face
formidable problems when they try to become No. 1.
   ``There is the burden of defending an incumbent administration
plus the fact that the job is, in a way, a wimpy job,'' said <PERSON>Leo
Ribuffo</PERSON>, a specialist in political history at <ORGANIZATION>George Washington
University</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``A vice president, for better or for worse, is defined in large
part by the public's view of the president he serves,'' said <PERSON>Frank
J. Donatelli</PERSON>, President <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>'s chief political aide.
   ``The fact that we have to hear talk about the Reagan-Bush
administration, as we once had to about Eisenhower-Nixon, is
nonsense,'' said <PERSON>Stephen Hess</PERSON>, a senior fellow at the Brookings
Institution who was an aide in the <ORGANIZATION>Eisenhower White House</ORGANIZATION>. ``It's
not the Reagan-Bush administration; it's the <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>
administration.''
   <PERSON>Ryan Barrileaux</PERSON>, a professor at <ORGANIZATION>Miami University</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Oxford</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, is a member of a new school of political scientists who
regard the vice presidency as an important post. But even he agreed
that ``a lot of vice presidents have the problem that they are
regarded by people as being generally insignificant.''
   ``I think what happens is that they tend to regard him as
nothing more than a senior presidential aide,'' said <PERSON>Barrileaux</PERSON>.
``They don't really think of him as an independent politician or as
someone with a standing in his own right.''
   Scholars say that during much of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> history, vice presidents
were not regarded as presidential contenders, except for those like
<PERSON>Theodore Roosevelt</PERSON> or <PERSON>Andrew Johnson</PERSON> who became president when an
incumbent died.
   ``During most of the <DATE>19th century</DATE>, with a couple of exceptions
such as <PERSON>John Calhoun</PERSON>, vice presidents were nonentities,'' said
<PERSON>Ribuffo</PERSON>.
   ``It was other offices that were regarded as breeding grounds
for presidents,'' said Barrileaux. ``For much of American history
the secretary of state was regarded as a sort of potential
president.''
   For more than a century after <PERSON>Van Buren</PERSON>, no vice president ran
for president, according to ``Presidential Also-Rans and Running
Mates, 1788-1899,'' compiled by <PERSON>Leslie H. Southwick</PERSON>.
   The last one who passed up a shot at it, however, was <PERSON>Charles G.
Dawes</PERSON> in <DATE>1928</DATE>. When President <PERSON>Calvin Coolidge</PERSON> announced that he did
not choose to run, Vice President <PERSON>Dawes</PERSON> did not choose to run
either.
   In each of the next four presidential elections, <DATE>1932</DATE> through
<DATE>1944</DATE>, the incumbent was running for re-election, so there was no
realistic chance for the vice president to step in. In <DATE>1948</DATE>, with
<PERSON>Truman</PERSON> filling out <PERSON>Roosevelt</PERSON>'s term, there was no vice president.
   Then came <PERSON>Barkley</PERSON>'s abortive try in <DATE>1952</DATE>. In <DATE>1956</DATE>, <PERSON>Eisenhower</PERSON>
was on the ticket. In <DATE>1964</DATE> the vice presidency was again vacant. In
<DATE>1972</DATE>, <DATE>1976</DATE>, <DATE>1980</DATE> and <DATE>1984</DATE>, incumbents were on the ballot for
president _ first <PERSON>Nixon</PERSON>, then <ORGANIZATION>Gerald Ford</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Jimmy Carter</PERSON> and <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>.
   Which brings up <DATE>1988</DATE> and <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>.
   ``This is different, not only to the degree that <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> is
anxious to do something to help <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> on the stump as a campaign
speaker, but also to the degree that he seems almost to have turned
over major decisions of government to <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>, where <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> cared to
involve himself,'' said <PERSON>Hess</PERSON>.
   As examples, the Brookings scholar cited <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>'s veto of a
defense authorization bill and his decision to allow a trade bill
to become law without his signature instead of vetoing it, even
though it contained a plant-closing amendment that he stoutly
opposed. Both actions were favored by <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> although opposed by some
other <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> advisers.
   Other examples, said <PERSON>Hess</PERSON>, are <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>'s appointment of Secretary
of the Treasury <PERSON>Nicholas Brady</PERSON> and Attorney General <PERSON>Dick
Thornburgh</PERSON>, both <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> allies, and the choice for education
secretary of <PERSON>Lauro F. Cavazos</PERSON>, an Hispanic from politically crucial
<LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>.
   ``Also, the country is at peace and feeling prosperous,'' he
said. ``In <DATE>1960</DATE>, we were coming out of a recession. In <DATE>1968</DATE> there
was a war. We are not talking about so many cases that we can
crunch them through a computer. We are talking about a couple of
cases, and each one is a little different, but this one is very
different.''
   <PERSON>Hess</PERSON> and other scholars agreed that <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> has given <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> more
work to do as vice president than most previous presidents have,
although he did not make a key adviser of him as <PERSON>Carter</PERSON> did of his
vice president, <PERSON>Walter Mondale</PERSON>.
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> was ``not as important as <PERSON>Mondale</PERSON>, but certainly more
important than, say, <PERSON>Lyndon Johnson</PERSON> was in the <ORGANIZATION>Kennedy White
House</ORGANIZATION>,'' said Barrileaux.
   Although <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> has often pointed to <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s accomplishments as
vice president, <PERSON>Barrileaux</PERSON> said, ``I guess many people didn't think
of these things as terribly important.''
   ``When you mention things like the <ORGANIZATION>Task Force on Regulatory
Relief</ORGANIZATION>, that sounds very enigmatic to many voters, I would
imagine,'' said the <ORGANIZATION>Miami University</ORGANIZATION> scholar.
   <PERSON>Ribuffo</PERSON>, who is writing a book on <PERSON>Carter</PERSON>, said that <PERSON>Carter</PERSON>
``really did include (<PERSON>Mondale</PERSON>) in policy discussions and used him
extensively as a Capitol Hill lobbyist.''
   ``I don't get the impression that <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> used <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> nearly so
much or included him so much,'' the political historian said.
   However, he added, ``It doesn't seem to have hurt much so far.''

<HEAD>Austrian Team Reportedly Reached Mount McKinley Summit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TALKEETNA, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A three-member Austrian party have
reported reaching the summit of <LOCATION>Mount McKinley</LOCATION>, according to the
pilot who flew them to <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION>'s highest mountain two weeks
ago.
   A Japanese party was reported ``high on the mountain,'' and a
lone climber from <LOCATION>Anchorage</LOCATION> hopes to reach the top via the
treacherous <ORGANIZATION>Cassin Ridge</ORGANIZATION> route, the <ORGANIZATION>National Park Service</ORGANIZATION> said.
   Pilot <PERSON>Doug Geeting</PERSON> said <DATE>Monday</DATE> he established radio contact with
the Austrian party <DATE>Sunday</DATE> and was told all three members had reached
the summit of the 20,320-foot mountain.
   <PERSON>Geeting</PERSON> said the Austrians didn't say which day they reached the
top. <DATE>Monday</DATE>, they were at a base camp at 7,200 feet, awaiting a
flight out, but harsh weather restricted aviation.
   Up to this year, mountaineers had accomplished winter ascents of
<ORGANIZATION>McKinley</ORGANIZATION> nine times, with most traveling in parties. In <DATE>1988</DATE>, <PERSON>Vern
Tejas</PERSON>, a professional climbing guide from <LOCATION>Anchorage</LOCATION>, became the
first person to climb McKinley alone in the <DATE>winter</DATE> and survive the
trip.
   The Austrian party of professional guides led by <PERSON>Helmut
Steinmassl</PERSON>, 29, began its expedition <DATE>Feb. 14</DATE>, a day before the
Japanese party of three began its ascent. Geeting and the <ORGANIZATION>Park
Service</ORGANIZATION> said the exact location of the Japanese climbers was not
known. The group was led by <PERSON>Nobura Yamada</PERSON>, 39.
   ``All we've heard about the Japanese is that they're hunkered
down,'' Park Service Ranger <PERSON>Bob Seibert</PERSON> said. ``I'm sure they can't
move in those winds.''
   The Austrians had relatively favorable weather for their climb,
<PERSON>Seibert</PERSON> said, but conditions changed drastically by <DATE>Monday</DATE> as fierce
gusts swept over wide regions of <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION>, including the McKinley area.
   The solo climber, 33-year-old <PERSON>Dave Staley</PERSON>, began his climb <DATE>Sunday</DATE>
and planned to follow the <ORGANIZATION>Cassin Ridge</ORGANIZATION> route, <ORGANIZATION>Park Service</ORGANIZATION> spokesman
<PERSON>John Quinley</PERSON> said. Such an ascent has been accomplished only once by
a team and never by an individual climber, he said.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Cassin Ridge</ORGANIZATION> is ``a lot steeper than the West Buttress
(route) ... and it has a lot fewer sheltered camping sites,''
<PERSON>Quinley</PERSON> said.

<LEADPARA>  Scrambling for dollars to minimize hefty budget cuts, San Jose's
Franklin-McKinley School District is considering adding seventh and eighth
grades to an elementary school in one of its better neighborhoods -- and
giving first dibs to students who have abandoned its schools.;    While some
parents enthusiastically support the proposal, which could bring the district
$85,000, others argue it would create a system in which economics would
dictate which public school a child goes to.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Local  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  PLAN TO WOO BACK STUDENTS RAISES EYEBROWS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     "We're a public school and we ought to serve the needs of all our
students," said <PERSON>Debbie Elliott</PERSON>, a registrar at <ORGANIZATION>J.W. Fair Middle School</ORGANIZATION> who
opposes the plan.;    Under the proposal, Franklin-McKinley would add seventh
and eighth grades to <ORGANIZATION>Stonegate School</ORGANIZATION>, an elementary school in a quiet
residential neighborhood near the <LOCATION>Santa Clara County Fairgrounds</LOCATION>. First
priority for admission would go to students who live anywhere in the district
but go to private schools or public schools outside the district. Next in line
would be youths whose parents say they are considering such an exodus.;    Now
seventh- and eighth-graders go to the district's two middle schools, including
<PERSON>J.W. Fair</PERSON>, in one of <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION>'s roughest neighborhoods.;   
Franklin-McKinley's board is scheduled to discuss the idea at a public meeting
tonight. No date has been set for a vote. But Superintendent <PERSON>Dolores
Ballesteros</PERSON> said the district must move quickly to have the new grades up and
running at <LOCATION>Stonegate</LOCATION> by fall.;    <LOCATION>Ballesteros</LOCATION> said the district already has a
stack of applications from parents who want to send their children to a new
seventh and eighth grade at <LOCATION>Stonegate</LOCATION>. Some favor <LOCATION>Stonegate</LOCATION> because it is
close to their homes. Others say the school would provide the nurturing,
academically rigorous environment they seek for their children.;    At last
week's school board meeting, only trustee Lolita Foster solidly endorsed the
proposal, arguing that the district must do something to meet the needs of
students who are leaving. But the four other board members expressed
reservations.;    "Fair right now is at a minimum enrollment," said trustee
<PERSON>Ronald Masuda</PERSON>. "They are trying desperately to raise that. This might lower
their enrollment to below minimum.";    District administrators, who floated
the idea, said about 125 middle school students who are eligible to attend its
schools are going elsewhere. Attracting these students back could bring in
<MONEY>$350,000</MONEY> in state revenue. After paying teachers' salaries and other costs,
that would earn the district <MONEY>$85,000</MONEY> at a time when Franklin-McKinley faces
<MONEY>$2.5 million</MONEY> in budget cuts next year, or <PERCENT>9 percent</PERCENT> of what it currently
spends.;    "The idea came out of talks to minimize cuts," <PERSON>Ballesteros</PERSON> said.
She added that it would use three classrooms at <LOCATION>Stonegate</LOCATION> that are vacant.
Stonegate's enrollment is about 750.;    But some parents with children at
Fair take it as an insult to their school and to the other district middle
school, <LOCATION>Sylvandale.</LOCATION>;    "It's a slap on both our junior high schools," said
<PERSON>Darlene Gearso</PERSON>, whose daughter attends eighth grade at Fair. "It's saying the
teachers (there) are not doing a good job.";    Unlike <LOCATION>Stonegate</LOCATION>'s feeder
area, which consists largely of stable homeowners, Fair also takes in schools
such as <LOCATION>Santee</LOCATION>, where <PERCENT>60 percent</PERCENT> of the students leave in a year.;    "It (the
<LOCATION>Santee</LOCATION> neighborhood) is where most new immigrants come because there's cheap
housing," said <PERSON>Herm Shaver</PERSON>, a recreation superintendent with <PERSON>San Jose</PERSON>'s
<ORGANIZATION>Project Crackdown</ORGANIZATION>, a program to reduce drug dealing in neighborhoods.;    The
<PERSON>Santee</PERSON> neighborhood's incidence of drug arrests ranks among the top six in the
city, <PERSON>Shaver</PERSON> said.;    It is concerns such as these that have some parents
worried about sending their children to seventh grade at Fair and eager to
enroll them at <LOCATION>Stonegate</LOCATION> instead.;    "<LOCATION>Stonegate</LOCATION> is a safe school, a safe
area," said <PERSON>David Dees</PERSON>, a manager at <ORGANIZATION>Sun Microsystems</ORGANIZATION> who has a son at Fair.
"It's a lot safer than Fair.";     IF YOU'RE INTERESTED; The Franklin-McKinley
school board will meet tonight in the board room at the district office at 420
<ORGANIZATION>Tully Road</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION>. The <LOCATION>Stonegate</LOCATION> proposal is scheduled to be discussed at

My son, who is in the first grade, goes to <ORGANIZATION>McKinley Elementary School</ORGANIZATION>, located 
in the mid-city area of <LOCATION>Santa Monica</LOCATION>. There is an extraordinary and wonderful 
diversity at this school. 
</P>
<P>
This year's kindergarten class, for example, has 62 students, 38 of whom speak 
a language other than English at home. Fifteen of the children speak Spanish, 
and among the remaining 23 kids, 12 other languages are spoken. All together, 
there are kids from 45 nationalities in a school of 450 students, an ethnic 
flowering that does justice to the concept of <LOCATION>Greater Los Angeles</LOCATION> as a "world 
city." 
</P>
<P>
There is also a wide diversity in economic levels at <ORGANIZATION>McKinley</ORGANIZATION>. Though some 
families are homeowners or live in condos, most McKinley families tend to be at 
the lower end of <LOCATION>Santa Monica</LOCATION>'s income scale. A number of the kids are homeless 
(about <PERCENT>3%</PERCENT> of the school-age population this year, but as high as <PERCENT>10%</PERCENT> last 
year). As many as <PERCENT>15%</PERCENT> of the kids do not live in <LOCATION>Santa Monica</LOCATION>. Their families 
work in the city, and school board policy allows the children to attend <LOCATION>Santa 
Monica</LOCATION> schools. This policy is particularly relevant in the <LOCATION>McKinley</LOCATION> area, 
where there has been an explosion of commercial development. 
</P>
<P>
When I drop my son off in the <TIME>morning</TIME>, I love to walk through the schoolyard. 
There is a magnificent vibrancy, a special richness to how kids from such a 
variety of families interact and enjoy each other. 
</P>
<P>
The school has a number of teachers, several just launching their careers, who 
also seem to relish the challenges inherent in the situation. This year, my son 
is in a bilingual class that he loves, although in some ways "bilingual" is a 
euphemism. Ultimately, perhaps, <ORGANIZATION>McKinley</ORGANIZATION> is no different from other schools in 
that the kids are taught to read and write in English, do math and learn much 
of the standard state curriculum. The diversity is in the numbers and in the 
daily life of the school beyond what is formally taught. 
</P>
<P>
Despite this richness of opportunities, <LOCATION>McKinley</LOCATION>, like nearly all our public 
schools, confronts a range of serious problems. Per-pupil spending in 
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION> has declined dramatically, from <MONEY>$4,200</MONEY> to less than <MONEY>$3,200</MONEY>, in this 
post-Proposition 13 era. That means more students per class, less equipment, 
less money for teacher salaries and and less money to upgrade facilities. Fund 
raising by <ORGANIZATION>McKinley</ORGANIZATION> parents averages about <MONEY>$25</MONEY> to <MONEY>$50</MONEY> per pupil, compared to a 
couple of the schools north of us, where wealthier parents have been able to 
raise as much as <MONEY>$1,250</MONEY> per pupil. 
</P>
<P>
McKinley also has to contend with problems stemming from commercial 
development: more traffic, smog, noise and different land uses. Yet the <ORGANIZATION>Santa 
Monica City Council</ORGANIZATION>, which has been at the forefront in arranging developer 
agreements responsible for such community needs as additional low-income 
housing or on-site environmental innovations, has never included support for 
public schools, despite the fact that they are directly affected by these 
developments. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps most disturbing is the contrast between the school population and the 
neighborhood population. Though <PERSON>Santa Monica</PERSON> has the undeserved reputation of 
being primarily a wealthy enclave (both the income levels and ethnic makeup of 
the entire city tend to reflect <LOCATION>Los Angeles County</LOCATION> averages), there are to be 
sure middle- and upper-class residents, including <PERSON>McKinley</PERSON>'s neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Although some of these residents do not have children, an increasing number do. 
Many of these children are being sent not to the McKinleys but to private 
schools. Though these schools pay lip service to "diversity" by offering a 
handful of scholarships, tuition cost alone (about <MONEY>$6,000</MONEY>) ensures a class and 
racial exclusivity. 
</P>
<P>
This two-tier public-private school division is at the heart of the dilemma for 
schools like <ORGANIZATION>McKinley</ORGANIZATION>. Private schools are a private solution, and their growth 
mirrors the erosion of citizen involvement throughout society. We have learned 
of the importance of taking responsibility from such issues as environmental 
degradation. So too, the schools have to become our public responsibility, from 
our individual choices to our actions at the community and statewide level. And 
as I walk through this schoolyard, listening to the excitement of the children, 
I wish their vibrancy could extend to our communities and to the larger 
society, where public engagement remains so elusive.

<TEXT>
   Four Japanese mountain climbers
attempting a winter ascent of <ORGANIZATION>Mount McKinley</ORGANIZATION>'s dangerous West
Buttress haven't been seen in nearly two weeks.
   Four other climbers have died on <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION>'s highest
mountain during winter.
   At high elevations in <DATE>winter</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>McKinley</ORGANIZATION> often has white-out
conditions with wind that can exceed 200 mph. The mountain is in
<LOCATION>Denali National Park</LOCATION>, the native American name for the mountain.
   The climbers and their equipment, including a 35-day supply of
food, were flown to a camp on the southeast fork of the <PERSON>Kahiltna
Glacier</PERSON> on <DATE>Feb. 11</DATE>, said <ORGANIZATION>Park Service</ORGANIZATION> mountaineering ranger <PERSON>Bob
Seibert</PERSON>. Since then, the weather on the 20,320-foot mountain
generally has been bad.
   Cliff Hudson, a bush pilot who flew the group onto the mountain,
said he was scheduled to check on them last week. But he said he
could not because visibility on the mountain has been close to zero.
   Hudson and <PERSON>Seibert</PERSON> said the group was last seen <DATE>Feb. 22</DATE> at about
the 11,000-foot level by a plane flying overhead. There were no
apparent problems.
   Hudson said he would try to fly over the mountain as soon as
weather permitted. ``They have priority,'' he said.
   When the group left <LOCATION>Talkeetna</LOCATION>, outside the park, they gave <DATE>March
15</DATE> as the ``last due out'' date, <PERSON>Seibert</PERSON> said. That is the day a
search would begin if they don't return.
   <PERSON>Hiroshi Oda</PERSON>, 37 of <LOCATION>Osaka</LOCATION>, is leading the <DATE>1990</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>Japan Winter
McKinley Expedition</ORGANIZATION>. With him are <PERSON>Takeyoshi Takatsuka</PERSON>, 47, of
<LOCATION>Toyama</LOCATION>; <PERSON>Osamu Tagaya</PERSON>, 34, of <LOCATION>Akita</LOCATION>; and <PERSON>Junji Saito</PERSON>, 25, also of
<LOCATION>Osaka</LOCATION>.
   All four are experienced mountaineers, <PERSON>Seibert</PERSON> said.
   Oda has successfully climbed <LOCATION>Mount Everest</LOCATION> and <PERSON>McKinley</PERSON>'s <LOCATION>West
Buttress</LOCATION> during <DATE>summer</DATE>, and <ORGANIZATION>Takatsuka</ORGANIZATION> has scaled <ORGANIZATION>Everest</ORGANIZATION> and K2,
the two highest peaks in the world, <PERSON>Seibert</PERSON> said.
   If successful, they would be the first Japanese to successfully
scale the <LOCATION>West Buttress</LOCATION> in winter.
   Last <DATE>March</DATE>, three Japanese climbers were lost in a storm on
their way up the mountain during a storm that featured 200-plus mph
wind. A fourth member of that group returned to camp alone before
his fellow climbers were lost.
   In <DATE>1984</DATE>, solo adventurer <PERSON>Naomi Uemura</PERSON> died on his way down the
mountain after planting his flag at the top. It is believed he also
died in a winter storm, <PERSON>Seibert</PERSON> said.

   The .45-caliber Colt revolver was discovered missing from
<LOCATION>Sagamore Hill</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>Long Island</LOCATION> home of the nation's 26th president,
which is run as a museum by the <ORGANIZATION>National Park Service</ORGANIZATION>.
   Chief <PERSON>Ranger Ray Bloomer</PERSON>, who is blind, noticed <DATE>Saturday</DATE> that
the exhibit case that contained the gun was loose, and summoned a
sighted <ORGANIZATION>Park Service</ORGANIZATION> investigator. Nothing else was missing from
the case, which also contained <PERSON>Roosevelt</PERSON>'s Rough Riders uniform,
hat and gloves.
   It appeared someone forced open a door to the case <DATE>Thursday</DATE> or
<DATE>Friday</DATE>, <PERSON>Bloomer</PERSON> said. Fifty to 100 visitors pass through on an
average day.
   The pistol, now valued at <MONEY>$500,000</MONEY>, was given to <PERSON>Roosevelt</PERSON> after
it was recovered from the battleship <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION>, whose sinking in <LOCATION>Havana
Harbor</LOCATION> in <DATE>1898</DATE> led to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>' declaration of war against
<LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>.
   The gun's blued barrel is inscribed with the words, ``<DATE>July 1,
1898</DATE>, <LOCATION>San Juan</LOCATION>, carried and used by Col. <PERSON>Theodore Roosevelt</PERSON>,'' and
``From the sunken battleship MAINE.''
   Roosevelt killed at least one enemy soldier with the gun during
the charge up <LOCATION>San Juan Hill</LOCATION> that gave the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Army</ORGANIZATION> control of the
hills overlooking <LOCATION>Havana</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Roosevelt</PERSON> his reputation as a national
hero, <ORGANIZATION>Bloomer</ORGANIZATION> said. The only other weapon he carried during the
charge was his sword.
   The inscription should make it difficult to sell at its
estimated value of <MONEY>$500,000</MONEY>, said <ORGANIZATION>Park Service</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON>Edie
Shean-Hammond</PERSON>.
   Roosevelt became president after <PERSON>William McKinley</PERSON> was
assassinated in <DATE>1901</DATE> and served until <DATE>1909</DATE>.

<TEXT>
   Vernon <ORGANIZATION>Tejas</ORGANIZATION> awoke uneasily in the
darkness of his snow cave, high on <ORGANIZATION>Mount McKinley</ORGANIZATION>. It was his 20th
day climbing the continent's highest peak, and he was the only
living soul for miles.
   But now someone, or something, seemed to be in the cave with him.
   ``It could have been just the wind,'' the 35-year-old Alaskan
recalled. ``But I was pretty convinced right then and there that
<PERSON>Naomi</PERSON> was in there with me.''
   On <DATE>Feb. 12, 1984</DATE>, <PERSON>Naomi Uemura</PERSON> became the first mountaineer to
scale <ORGANIZATION>Mount McKinley</ORGANIZATION> alone in winter. He vanished in a storm on the
way down, and some veteran climbers believe the Japanese explorer's
spirit still roams the mountain.
   Tejas called out ``Good morning!'' in Japanese. The roaring wind
outside gave the only reply, and <ORGANIZATION>Tejas</ORGANIZATION> settled back, convinced the
spirit was benign.
   The wind eased the next day, <DATE>March 7</DATE>, and <ORGANIZATION>Tejas</ORGANIZATION> climbed to the
summit, where he planted a Japanese flag to honor the man who
blazed the way for him. Then he did something <ORGANIZATION>Uemura</ORGANIZATION> failed to do.
He came back.
   Mount <PERSON>McKinley</PERSON>, elevation 20,320 feet, is considered <LOCATION>North
America</LOCATION>'s ultimate mountaineering challenge. The vertical reach
from base camp on the <PERSON>Kahiltna Glacier</PERSON> to the summit is 13,200 feet
_ about 2,000 feet greater than the climb up <LOCATION>Mount Everest</LOCATION>.
   Each <DATE>May</DATE> and <DATE>June</DATE>, hundreds of climbers flock to <ORGANIZATION>McKinley</ORGANIZATION>.
Unbearable arctic weather forces more than half to turn back short
of the summit.
   In <DATE>winter</DATE>, the unbearable turns unbelievable. Temperatures can
dip to minus 58 degrees, and storms rake the mountain with
hurricane-force winds.
   Only four teams have made it to the top in winter since the
first expedition in <DATE>1967</DATE>; two of them lost climbers. Uemura was one
of two climbers to die in a recent flurry of solo winter attempts.
   In all, <ORGANIZATION>McKinley</ORGANIZATION>'s slopes are littered with the memories of more
than 50 dead climbers.
   Tejas knows all the grim mileposts _ crevassed areas named for
climbers they swallowed, a slope dubbed the Autobahn for the many
Germans who have fallen there _ and he uses them as warning signs.
   ``I want to challenge myself to live as fully and completely as
possible,'' he said. ``A lot of people will say, `You're doing
something that jeopardizes your ability to live.' But by living on
the edge, I can define life a lot easier. It doesn't make you love
it any less. It makes you love it more.''
   Tejas returned as something of a local hero. As he sat recently
in a sunlit <LOCATION>Anchorage</LOCATION> cafe, strangers kept interrupting to
congratulate him.
   They stopped partly because of his accomplishment, partly
because <ORGANIZATION>Tejas</ORGANIZATION> is hard to miss. His head, at its lower elevations,
is forested by a bushy black beard; the summit is bare, shaved
daily except for a neatly braided rattail.
   Tejas (pronounced TAY-hoss) stands 5-foot-8 and has a
personality that lives up to his hairstyle. A veteran of 13
successful McKinley climbs, most of them as a guide for Genet
Expeditions, he bounces boisterous yodels off the bergschrund and
readily pulls a fiddle from his pack to scratch out folk tunes.
   He came to <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION> in <DATE>1973</DATE>, a flatlander from <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION>. Within
three days, he stood slack-jawed in <LOCATION>Denali National Park</LOCATION>, watching
as clouds unveiled <PERSON>McKinley</PERSON>'s towering north face. <ORGANIZATION>Tejas</ORGANIZATION> fell in
love.
   He worked construction jobs and lived in a tent to save money
``to get into climbing big time.'' He first climbed <ORGANIZATION>McKinley</ORGANIZATION> in
<DATE>1978</DATE>; the next year he was invited back to guide.
   In <DATE>1986</DATE>, he led the first successful winter climb of <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>'s
<LOCATION>Mount Logan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION>'s second-tallest peak. Two months later,
back on <ORGANIZATION>McKinley</ORGANIZATION>, he took part in a daring rescue, climbing over
the summit ridge and rappelling 600 feet to reach two altitude-sick
Korean climbers.
   <ORGANIZATION>National Park Service</ORGANIZATION> rangers discourage solo climbs of <ORGANIZATION>McKinley</ORGANIZATION>
and tried to dissuade another climber who started up the same day
as <ORGANIZATION>Tejas</ORGANIZATION>. That climber, with no previous arctic experience, was
flown out with frostbitten toes after five days.
   <ORGANIZATION>Tejas</ORGANIZATION> was not warned.
   ``I think <PERSON>Vern</PERSON> is a very special case,'' said <PERSON>Ralph Moore</PERSON>, a
mountaineering ranger who lauds <ORGANIZATION>Tejas</ORGANIZATION> as a cautious climber and a
meticulous planner. ``With <PERSON>Vern</PERSON>, it was a very calculated risk. He
knew what he was getting into.''
   Tejas proudly notes he can still count to 20 on his fingers and
toes, each digit intact and unfrozen. To prevent slips into
crevasses on his solo climb, he strapped a 16-foot extension ladder
to his body _ ``my aluminum albatross,'' he calls it.
   <ORGANIZATION>Tejas</ORGANIZATION> was flown to <ORGANIZATION>McKinley</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Feb. 16</DATE> by glacier pilot <PERSON>Lowell
Thomas Jr</PERSON>. He carried 170 pounds of gear and enough food for 16
days. But as he packed a toboggan, he decided he had too much. He
left behind his tent and 20 pounds of food.

<LEADPARA>  As of last week, 99 parents had applied to enroll their students in the
seventh grade to be opened at Franklin-McKinley School District's Stonegate
School this fall.;    And the district will be able to admit them all, except
for the three late applicants, who will be added to the waiting list.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "We can hold anywhere from 85 to 95 students," said Assistant
Superintendent <PERSON>Jim Abbott.</PERSON>;    The application period for the new program was
from <DATE>June 19</DATE> to 26.;    The largest number of students guaranteed seats -- 30
-- came from <LOCATION>Stonegate</LOCATION> itself. Windmill Springs students added another 18 to
the pool. Kids from <LOCATION>Hillsdale</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> and Seven Trees schools contributed
10, 9, and 8 respectively to the tally.;    The remaining seven schools
accounted for six or fewer applicants each. The lowest participation -- one
applicant each -- came from <LOCATION>Los Arboles</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>McKinley</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Santee</LOCATION> schools.;   
"<LOCATION>Stonegate</LOCATION> had the most applicants, but it wasn't lopsided as people thought
it would be," said Superintendent <PERSON>Dolores Ballesteros.</PERSON>;    Now seventh- and
eighth-graders are assigned to one of the district's two middle schools, <PERSON>J.W.
Fair</PERSON> and Sylvandale, depending on their attendance area. The seventh grade at
<LOCATION>Stonegate</LOCATION> will offer them a choice. If the pilot program succeeds, an eighth
grade will be added the following year.;    Approved by <ORGANIZATION>Franklin-McKinley</ORGANIZATION>'s
school board in <DATE>June</DATE>, the <LOCATION>Stonegate</LOCATION> idea was defended by supporters as a way
of retaining students who need a more sheltered environment than the middle
schools can provide. But it was also slammed by opponents as catering only to
<LOCATION>Stonegate</LOCATION> parents -- at the expense of the district's poorer neighborhoods.;  
 To help assure equal access to parents in the multilingual community, staff
members sent applications out in four languages -- English, Spanish,
Vietnamese and Cambodian. But most forms came back in English, <LOCATION>Abbott</LOCATION> said.;  
 <ORGANIZATION>McKinley</ORGANIZATION> Principal <PERSON>Rod Cryer</PERSON> said he was not surprised that interest in a
seventh grade at <LOCATION>Stonegate</LOCATION> was so low in his school, which has one of the
district's highest concentrations of families who speak little English or who
are on welfare.;    "A lot of our parents didn't go past the fourth grade if
they went to school at all," <PERSON>Cryer</PERSON> said. Having a seventh-grade option "might
not be a meaningful option to them," he said.;    Though the district will bus
students to the new seventh grade, <PERSON>Cryer</PERSON> said transportation is still an
issue.;    "Parents want to feel they can get to a child in an emergency. And
in our school, many have no personal transportation," <PERSON>Cryer</PERSON> said. "They are
not necessarily literate. They may have difficulty using transit systems.";   
<ORGANIZATION>McKinley</ORGANIZATION> is the northernmost school from <LOCATION>Stonegate</LOCATION>, which is in the district's
center.;    Plans call for a seventh and eighth grade to be added at two
elementary schools in the north and south of the district in upcoming years.; 
  A <LOCATION>Stonegate</LOCATION> father whose daughter has been accepted in the new program said
he was excited.;    "I would like her to stay in <LOCATION>Stonegate</LOCATION> because it's a
quiet neighborhood nearby my house," Quang To said.;    And a mother whose son
will come from the <LOCATION>Windmill Springs</LOCATION> area said she believes her son will get a
good academic foundation at Stonegate.;    "I'm happy they're going to bus
them over," <PERSON>Gloria Avila</PERSON> added. "It puts a little less pressure on us."  </TEXT>

   A woman whose guided party
was pushing for <ORGANIZATION>Mount McKinley</ORGANIZATION>'s summit has become the first
fatality of the <DATE>1988</DATE> climbing season on <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION>'s tallest
peak, the <ORGANIZATION>National Park Service</ORGANIZATION> said.
   The agency said it learned early <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> that <PERSON>Lynn Salerno</PERSON>,
31, of <LOCATION>Anchorage</LOCATION>, had died of apparent hypothermia and exposure at
the mountain's 19,500-foot level. Rangers did not know the
circumstances or time of death.
   Salerno was in a party led by <PERSON>Vern Tejas</PERSON>, 35, an Alaskan whose
solo winter ascent of 20,320-foot McKinley this year made
mountaineering history.
   The party is believed to have begun its climb on or about <DATE>May 1</DATE>.

error, a story in some editions of Tuesday's Mercury News misstated two items
in Franklin-McKinley School District's proposed 1991-'92 budget. Grants to
encourage innovative teaching are being proposed for reduction, not
elimination. And the Gifted and Talented Education program is not being
proposed for either elimination or reduction. A proposal recommends that
unused lottery money set aside for GATE be funneled to other uses.  </MEMO>
