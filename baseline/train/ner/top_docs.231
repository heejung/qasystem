<HEAD>France Recalls Vichy's Anti-Semitic Laws</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARILYN AUGUST</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Acts of persecution and harsh anti-Semitism among
Nazi collaborators were relived and re-examined <DATE>Monday</DATE>, 50 years
after the start of a notorious crackdown that led to the deaths of
more than 73,000 French Jews.
   ``We must not blame the (Nazi) occupation for what was the sole
responsibility of the legitimate French government. The laws met
only utter silence from the French people,'' said former Justice
Minister <PERSON>Robert Badinter</PERSON>, who presided over the daylong symposium
on ``The Vichy Laws.''
   ``Vichy was obsessed with taking measures against Jews,''
<PERSON>Badinter</PERSON> told about 250 people at the conference.
   ``The Vichy Laws,'' named for the <ORGANIZATION>Vichy Government</ORGANIZATION> that
controlled unoccupied <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> and territories from <DATE>1940</DATE> to <DATE>1943</DATE>,
prevented <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>'s 350,000 Jews from holding public office,
teaching, attending university, owning stores and working in the
media. It was implemented 11 weeks after <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> fell to the Germans.
   The laws, later reinforced by measures to send Jews to
concentration camps, defined ``who is a Jew,'' using criteria far
more sweeping than the racial laws drafted by the <ORGANIZATION>Nazis</ORGANIZATION>.
   Nazi hunter <PERSON>Serge Klarsfeld</PERSON> estimated 3,000 Jews died from cold
and starvation from <DATE>1940</DATE> to <DATE>1942</DATE> in French-run camps ``where there
wasn't a single German soldier.''
   In all, 76,000 Jews were deported to death camps from <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>.
About 2,500 survived, historians estimate.
   ``The Jewish Laws did not come out of the blue because
anti-Semitism existed in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> well before the German victory in
<DATE>June 1940</DATE>,'' said <PERSON>Henri Amouroux</PERSON>, a historian at the symposium,
sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION>Center for Contemporary Jewish Documentation</ORGANIZATION> and
the Sons and <ORGANIZATION>Daughters of Jews Deported</ORGANIZATION> from the <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>.
   ``Anti-Semitism developed in the <DATE>1930s</DATE> in a climate of economic
and social crisis. Thousands of Jews, chased out of <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Austria</LOCATION>, fleeing the <LOCATION>Nazis</LOCATION>, came to <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> and were accused of
taking jobs,'' he said.
   Historians say the <PERSON>Vichy</PERSON> laws were a cornerstone of a right-wing
ideology that sought to undo the liberalizing, human
rights-oriented reforms of the French Revolution.
   ``The laws erased the advances made during the Age of
Enlightenment,'' said <PERSON>Zev Sternhell</PERSON>, a history professor at the
<ORGANIZATION>University of Jerusalem</ORGANIZATION>. ``They reflect a new concept of the
nation, not as a melting pot but as an extended family with
everybody having the same blood.''
   For historian <PERSON>Denis Peschansky</PERSON>, the laws were a way for Marshal
<PERSON>Philippe Petain</PERSON>, <PERSON>Vichy</PERSON>'s leader, to explain the French military
defeat and punish those deemed responsible.
   ``<PERSON>Petain</PERSON> had to find reasons within French society for the
debacle - he certainly couldn't blame the army because it was in
power - so he blamed the Jews, Communists, Freemasons and other
foreigners,'' <PERSON>Peschansky</PERSON> said.
   The laws also revoked the citizenship of about 400,000 Jews in
colonial <LOCATION>Algeria</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Morocco</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Tunisia</LOCATION>, which were French
protectorates.
   ``My mother, who had six small children and worked in the
arsenal in <LOCATION>Algiers</LOCATION>, was fired immediately,'' said a woman in the
audience.
   Other survivors described the discrimination and persecution
that followed.
   In <DATE>September 1943</DATE>, <PERSON>Samuel</PERSON> and <PERSON>Rachel Ewenczyk</PERSON> closed their dry
goods store in <LOCATION>Grenoble</LOCATION>, fleeing to the Alps to escape deportation.
   ``One week later, thanks to the <PERSON>Vichy</PERSON> laws, the French police
requisitioned the store as a Jewish store, and sold it to a
non-Jewish person,'' <PERSON>Mrs. Ewenczyk</PERSON>, 78, recalled.
   After <LOCATION>Grenoble</LOCATION> was liberated by <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> troops in <DATE>August 1944</DATE>, the
family returned to claim the property.
   ``The man in the shop protested, saying he had bought the shop,
but my husband asked, `Who did you buy it from? I never sold it.'
We were back in business <DATE>a week later</DATE>,'' she said.
   The <PERSON>Vichy</PERSON> government, named for a city in central <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, was
never recognized by the Allies. The Nazis annulled the armistice
with <PERSON>Vichy</PERSON> after the Allies invaded <LOCATION>North Africa</LOCATION> in <DATE>November 1943</DATE>
and occupied <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>.

victims? asks Robert Cottrell

<TEXT>
IF THE deranged killer of <PERSON>Rene Bousquet</PERSON>, the former <PERSON>Vichy</PERSON> government police
chief, acted criminally in the eyes of the French authorities, it must also
be said that he acted conveniently. Bousquet's murder on <DATE>June 8</DATE> came barely
a month before <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>'s first annual day of official remembrance for victims
of <ORGANIZATION>Vichy</ORGANIZATION>'s 'racist and anti-semitic persecutions.'
As a result, when prime minister <PERSON>Edouard Balladur</PERSON> delivered his remembrance
day speech in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> on <DATE>July 16</DATE>, he was no longer obliged to explain how the
man who had organised many of those 'racist and anti-semitic persecutions'
was still leading, at 84, the comfortable life of a retired banker barely a
mile away on the <ORGANIZATION>Avenue Raphael</ORGANIZATION>.
Though coincidental, the death of <PERSON>Bousquet</PERSON> and the introduction of a
remembrance day for <ORGANIZATION>Vichy</ORGANIZATION>'s victims have dramatised a national dilemma for
<LOCATION>France</LOCATION> in which history, morality and politics each plays a part: the
dilemma of whether <PERSON>Vichy</PERSON>, the wartime government of Marshal <PERSON>Philippe Petain</PERSON>,
which sought to lead a defeated and part-occupied <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> along the 'way of
collaboration' with <PERSON>Hitler</PERSON>, is a chapter of French history best remembered,
or best forgotten.
The inaugurating of a remembrance day may argue that the first of those
sentiments - to remember - has gained the high ground. But <PERSON>Rene Bousquet</PERSON>,
while he lived, proved the enduring power of those who would rather forget.
He displayed to his end a grim confidence that he would never be required to
face trial for his part in the deportation of some 75,000 Jews from <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>
to the Nazi death-camps.
'If they want to mess with me,' he said shortly before his death, 'then fine
. . . I will defend myself, and I have the material to do so. But I will be
utterly astonished if the trial takes place.'
It was with <PERSON>Bousquet</PERSON>'s authority that French police arrested 13,000 Jews in
<LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> on <DATE>July 16-17 1942</DATE>, including 4,000 children whom even the <ORGANIZATION>Nazis</ORGANIZATION> had
been willing to spare. Most were held in the Velodrome d'Hiver, a
since-demolished bicycle-track, before being sent to French-run
concentration camps south of <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> - and thence to <LOCATION>Auschwitz</LOCATION>.
The date of the start of that round-up having been fixed for the new
remembrance day, the ceremony in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> was held at the site of the
<LOCATION>Velodrome</LOCATION>, where unofficial ceremonies have taken place in past years. In
the course of a short and solemn speech, the prime minister declared that
<LOCATION>France</LOCATION> was 'in mourning,' and repeated the promise given by President
<PERSON>Francois Mitterrand</PERSON> that a monument would be erected 'to perpetuate the
memory of what took place here.'
Until that monument arises, the perpetuation of memory will rest heavily on
the work of <PERSON>Serge Klarsfeld</PERSON>, the French lawyer and Nazi-hunter who published
his investigation of Bousquet 10 years ago in a book called Vichy-Auschwitz.
Impelled by <PERSON>Klarsfeld</PERSON>, the French public prosecutor eventually charged
<PERSON>Bousquet</PERSON> in <DATE>1991</DATE> with 'crimes against humanity' (which under French law
enjoy no statute of limitation); but the case vanished into such thickets of
procedural delay that the prospective defendant was not alone in his doubts
that it would ever reach court.
Bousquet had already walked free from one post-war trial in <DATE>1949</DATE> because the
courts at that time were concerned with treason, not genocide, even though
the leaders of Vichy had furthered both causes. A half-century later, he was
the last survivor of those who planned the worst of Vichy's persecutions. To
that extent, his death has given one irreversible victory to those who think
Vichy best forgotten.
The possibility has been lost for ever of a great pedagogical trial which
might have examined and judged not only <PERSON>Bousquet</PERSON> himself, but also, through
him, the regime of which he was a part. French courts may yet try <PERSON>Paul
Touvier</PERSON>, a former officer in the collaborationist <LOCATION>Militia</LOCATION>, for alleged war
crimes. But <PERSON>Touvier</PERSON> was a relatively low-level figure, and is in any case
charged with acting on the orders of the <ORGANIZATION>Gestapo</ORGANIZATION>, not of Vichy.
To explain the last and decisive hesitations of French justice in respect of
the <PERSON>Bousquet</PERSON> case, <PERSON>Klarsfeld</PERSON> and others have pointed a finger at President
<PERSON>Mitterrand</PERSON>, who worked for the <PERSON>Vichy</PERSON> government from 1941-42 before entering
the resistance. Mitterrand reputedly met <PERSON>Bousquet</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Vichy</LOCATION>, and they moved
in the same political circles after the war.
Klarsfeld suggests that <PERSON>Mitterrand</PERSON> may nurse a 'nostalgia for his youth.' It
is, at any rate, an observable truth that the further the French president's
motives and actions extend into his past, the more impenetrable they become.
If <PERSON>Mitterrand</PERSON> did indeed choose discreetly to discourage <PERSON>Bousquet</PERSON>'s trial,
then he may well have done so partly out of a political judgment that such a
trial would not be in the public interest; partly out of a personal loyalty;
and partly out of that strange private reservoir of affections which has
also led him to send a bouquet of roses to <PERSON>Marshal Petain</PERSON>'s tomb each
<DATE>November 11</DATE>, the anniversary of the ending of the first world war.
Only after a barrage of criticism from his friends as well as political
rivals last <DATE>November</DATE> did the president finally concede that he would have to
find a way of managing differently the 'contradictions of history.' His
decree, <DATE>three months later</DATE>, instituting the remembrance day for <PERSON>Marshal
Petain</PERSON>'s victims, must be read as a realisation of that promise.
In opposing a judicial reopening of the great questions of <LOCATION>Vichy</LOCATION>, President
<PERSON>Mitterrand</PERSON> would also have been echoing the policy of <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> since the
Liberation. It was <ORGANIZATION>General de Gaulle</ORGANIZATION> who recognised in <DATE>1944</DATE> that <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>
could scarcely take its place among the victors of the second world war if
it also acknowledged the realities of the armistice and the collaboration
over which the <PERSON>Vichy</PERSON> government had presided.
His response was to decree that the French Third Republic had assigned power
unconstitutionally to <PERSON>Marshal Petain</PERSON> in <DATE>June 1940</DATE>; that the <PERSON>Vichy</PERSON> government
had been illegal from its formation; and that the armistice concluded by
<PERSON>Petain</PERSON> with <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> had been void. To efface what had once been the
substance of <LOCATION>Vichy</LOCATION>, the Gaullists substituted their insistence that the
'true' <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> had never surrendered; that the flame of legitimate government
had been carried through its dark hour by de Gaulle's Free French forces;
and that the mass of ordinary people remaining in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> had manifested
their loyalty by resisting the Nazi occupant.
It necessarily followed from the Gaullist version of history that atrocities
which had taken place in wartime <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> must have been attributable to
Germans, not Frenchmen. The plain fact that the <PERSON>Vichy</PERSON> government had devised
and implemented a policy of Jewish persecution, initially of its own
volition and later as the French contribution to the Nazi genocide, was -
with its potentially devastating implications for <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>'s reputation - the
most taboo subject of all, and one which the specially-convened <ORGANIZATION>High Court
of Justice</ORGANIZATION> showed absolutely no disposition to pursue in its post-war trials
of Vichy officials.
Thus <PERSON>Bousquet</PERSON>, among the last defendants to go before the court, faced no
serious questioning about his role in the arrest and deportation of Jews
from <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, and the documentary evidence in his prosecution file went
unexamined.
Suppressing the shame of Vichy helped restore the morale and the unity of
<LOCATION>France</LOCATION>. But it also impeded the drawing of lessons about how and why the
machinery of French government had in reality passed very smoothly into
<PERSON>Petain</PERSON>'s hands.
Not until <DATE>May 1992</DATE>, for example, did the national training centre for the
French police force feel able to conduct its first internal seminars on
police work during the war, the Ministry of the <ORGANIZATION>Interior</ORGANIZATION> having judged,
according to <PERSON>Le Monde</PERSON>, 'that the wounds were sufficiently healed for
reflection to be undertaken at the institutional level.'
Those who attended the seminars were reminded that <LOCATION>Nazi Germany</LOCATION> had been
able, with only 3,000 members of its own security services operating in
<LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, to secure the arrest and deportation from <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> of 75,000 Jews and
40,000 resistants, as well as to supply itself with 650,000 French forced
labourers.
Had the French police refused to do the <ORGANIZATION>Nazis</ORGANIZATION>' work, <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> would have been
obliged either to commit much more of its own manpower to <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, or else
reduce the scale of its oppressions there.
Today, if arguments still rage about the motives and the intentions of
<PERSON>Petain</PERSON>'s government, the concrete actions of Vichy are neither denied nor
deniable.
The problem which remains is one of political acceptance. The victims of
Vichy were persecuted on French soil, by agents of a French government, in
conformity with the French law of the day.
Can a formula be found by which the Republic of <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> may respond
honourably to the suffering of <PERSON>Vichy</PERSON>'s victims, and yet still, as it
believes it must, avoid identifying their tormentors at least to some degree
with <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> itself?
According to <PERSON>Jean-Pierre Chevenement</PERSON>, the former French defence minister,
the danger of blurring the distinction between the '<PERSON>Vichy</PERSON>' and the '<LOCATION>France</LOCATION>'
of 1940-44 remains that <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> would then 'stand with <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> in the fascist camp which lost the second world war . . . Her
permanent membership of the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations Security Council</ORGANIZATION>, with right of
veto, would lose its justification . . . By going down that road, <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>
would abdicate its place in the world.'
If <PERSON>Chevenement</PERSON>'s warnings appear exaggerated, they reflect well enough
<LOCATION>France</LOCATION>'s acute sensitivity to its 'rank,' particularly in relation to
<LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> within <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>.
Yet as the decades pass, and as death claims both the tormentors and
survivors of <LOCATION>Vichy</LOCATION>, the justification for denying Vichy so absolutely must
appear increasingly open to question, if the legacy and the lessons of <PERSON>Vichy</PERSON>
are to be rooted enduringly in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>'s memory.
In the view of <PERSON>Alfred Grosser</PERSON>, <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>'s leading political scientist: 'Let us
not make-believe that the <PERSON>Vichy</PERSON> regime was a little island standing apart
from French society, or that the ruling class of <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> went into
hibernation until the parenthesis was closed and the Republic could resume
its interrupted life.
'The victims of <LOCATION>Vichy</LOCATION>, French and non-French alike, were indeed the victims
of <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>. A <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> with a twisted expression, but a <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> which stands
clearly within the continuity of its own history.'

<HEAD>Opponents of Collaboration Honored On Vichy's 50th Anniversary</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> observed the 50th anniversary of the
formation of the collaborationist <PERSON>Vichy</PERSON> government <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> and
honored the <ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION> members who opposed Marshal <PERSON>Philippe
Petain</PERSON>'s ascension to power.
   Petain, a grandfatherly World War I hero, was installed as
all-powerful leader of the <PERSON>Vichy</PERSON> regime by a 569-80 vote on <DATE>July
10, 1940</DATE>.
   Three of the legislators who voted ``no'' survive, and two
attended commemorations at <LOCATION>Vichy</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Grand Casino</LOCATION>, where the vote was
taken. <PERSON>Maurice Montel</PERSON>, 90, and <PERSON>Emile Fouchard</PERSON>, 88, were joined by
Parliamentary Affairs Minister <PERSON>Jean Poperen</PERSON>.
   Poperen said the 80 lawmakers, acting ``with lucidity and
courage, against all the appearances and the evidence of the
moment, have earned the eternal recognition of the nation.''
   Vichy's mayor, <PERSON>Claude Malhuret</PERSON>, described the votes against
<PERSON>Petain</PERSON> as ``one of the first acts of resistance in our country.''
   Malhuret also said <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> should be vigilant in countering a
resurgence of racist and anti-Semitic rhetoric ``such as we heard
before the war.''
   <PERSON>Petain</PERSON>, who signed an armistice with the Germans on <DATE>June 22</DATE>, was
84 at the time, but widely respected across <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>. He was
convinced <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> would win the war and that <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> had no
alternative but to cooperate with <PERSON>Hitler</PERSON>.
   <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>'s government, including Parliament members, had fled from
<LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> as German forces approached, going first to Tours on <DATE>June 10</DATE>,
then to <LOCATION>Bordeaux</LOCATION> on <DATE>June 14</DATE> and <DATE>two weeks later</DATE> to <PERSON>Vichy</PERSON>, a
tranquil health spa.
   On <DATE>July 10</DATE>, the parliamentary majority adopted a text which
said: ``The <ORGANIZATION>National Assembly</ORGANIZATION> gives all power to the government of
the <LOCATION>Republic</LOCATION>, under the authority and the signature of <PERSON>Marshal
Petain</PERSON>, for the purpose of promoting a new constitution of the
French state.''
   Of the 80 legislators who opposed <PERSON>Petain</PERSON>, 31 were incarcerated
or put under house arrest during the war, two were killed and five
died in captivity.
   Since the war, <PERSON>Vichy</PERSON> has struggled to live down its association
with Nazi collaboration.
   In the <DATE>1930s</DATE>, the town ranked as <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>'s No. 1 mineral springs
resort. Now it ranks 14th, and unemployment in the town of 30,500
is estimated at <PERCENT>15 percent</PERCENT>.
   Malhuret described as ``irritating'' the link between <PERSON>Vichy</PERSON> and
the collaborationists.
   ``If the town of <PERSON>Vichy</PERSON> was partly responsible, it would be less
irritating,'' he told the French news agency <ORGANIZATION>Agence France-Presse</ORGANIZATION>.
``But that isn't the case. Nobody in <LOCATION>Vichy</LOCATION> went out in search of
the government and the assembly.''
   The <PERSON>Vichy</PERSON> government received little in return for its
collaboration, exporting goods and labor to <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> in exchange for
the privilege of running day-to-day administrative affairs. Only
two-fifths of <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> was under <PERSON>Vichy</PERSON>'s jurisdiction, the rest was
occupied territory.
   In <DATE>August 1944</DATE>, as Allied forces swept through <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Petain</PERSON>
fled <PERSON>Vichy</PERSON> and was arrested, then was allowed to leave for
<LOCATION>Switzerland</LOCATION>.
   He returned voluntarily to <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> in <DATE>April 1945</DATE>, was tried for
treason and sentenced to death. Charles De Gaulle commuted the
sentence to life imprisonment and <PERSON>Petain</PERSON> died in <DATE>1951</DATE> on the Isle
of Yeu, off <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> coast.
   In <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>, officials of the <ORGANIZATION>French Communist Party</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>
celebrated the 50th anniversary of an appeal by the outlawed
Communist underground for resistance against <PERSON>Petain</PERSON>.
   Communist legislator <PERSON>Andre Lajoinie</PERSON> said the men who isssud the
appeal represented ``the first resistance base on national
territory.'' A radio appeal for Frenchmen to resist the <ORGANIZATION>Nazis</ORGANIZATION> had
been broadcast from <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> on <DATE>June 18</DATE> by <ORGANIZATION>De Gaulle</ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
Revelations that President <PERSON>Francois Mitterrand</PERSON> of <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> had murky links
with the right wing before, during and after the second world war have sent
the French political class into a buzz of shock and horror. Socialists are
dismayed that this latest blow to the reputation of their one-time leader
will further contaminate their own damaged credibility. But not even his
rightwing critics have crowed too loudly, for no political clan is quite
comfortable when the <PERSON>Vichy</PERSON> era is under discussion.
That is the point of this controversy: it is not what it reveals about the
dubious political debut of <PERSON>Francois Mitterrand</PERSON>, but what it reveals about
the feelings of the French today towards that inglorious chapter of their
history. They still have difficulty facing up to what happened between the
<DATE>fall</DATE> of <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> in <DATE>1940</DATE> and the liberation of <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> in <DATE>1944</DATE>, when the <PERSON>Vichy</PERSON>
government of <PERSON>Marshal Petain</PERSON> submitted to the Nazi victors.
Every so often old wounds are reopened by a new investigation, and each time
the French react with consternation, as if they had never heard of that
traumatic era. Then the shock dies away, and the unacceptable past is again
buried.
So it is with the new book by <PERSON>Pierre Pean</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Une Jeunesse Francaise*</ORGANIZATION>. It
provides the fullest account yet of <LOCATION>Mitterrand</LOCATION>'s early career, with many
previously unpublished details. But most of the story has long been known:
that <PERSON>Mitterrand</PERSON> came from a conservative, bourgeois background, and started
his political career far to the right of centre; that before joining the
Resistance he worked for the <PERSON>Petain</PERSON> government, and was awarded the top
Vichy decoration, the 'Francisque'; and that he remained right of centre
after the war.
What is most disturbing about the book is not mainly what it reveals about
<PERSON>Mitterrand</PERSON> then, but what it reveals about <PERSON>Mitterrand</PERSON> now. Pean clears him
of any anti-semitism under <PERSON>Vichy</PERSON>; but it is dismaying that today <PERSON>Mitterrand</PERSON>
should still be pretending that he did not then know about <PERSON>Vichy</PERSON>'s
anti-semitic laws, even though they led to the deportation of thousands of
Jews to German extermination camps.
Given his bourgeois, provincial background in the unstable years before the
war, it is not surprising that <PERSON>Mitterrand</PERSON> should have flirted as a young man
with the far right; but the fact that his friends continued to include
people from the far right, not just after the war but into the <DATE>1980s</DATE>, will
reinforce his opponents' conviction that <PERSON>Mitterrand</PERSON> has few political
principles.
Perhaps the bottom line is that the president refuses to accept <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>'s
historical and political responsibility for the debacle of 1940-44. As far
as he is concerned, <PERSON>Vichy</PERSON> was a different regime, and nothing to do with the
republic - in fact, nothing to do with us today. It is as if <PERSON>Vichy</PERSON> were an
accident, without organic origins in French political history, for which no
one was responsible.
It is in such terms that the French have repeatedly refused to accept shared
responsibility for their history. Throughout the political instability of
the <DATE>19th century</DATE>, each succeeding regime was permanently under attack in
terms of its essential legitimacy; and the rightwing tradition which
rejected the legitimacy of republican democracy eventually erupted in the
anti-semitism of the <ORGANIZATION>Dreyfus</ORGANIZATION> case in <DATE>1894</DATE>, when the Jewish army officer was
falsely accused of spying for <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>.
The <PERSON>Petain</PERSON> regime was no doubt exceptional; it was not an accident. Like the
nationalism of the <DATE>late 19th century</DATE>, it was a reaction to humiliating
defeat by the Germans. The French have since tried to exorcise it as
illegitimate; but unless they find some way of accepting collective
responsibility for it, the struggles between rival concepts of political
legitimacy will rage on, threatening instability.
Throughout the <DATE>1950s</DATE>, de Gaulle denounced the illegitimacy of the <ORGANIZATION>Fourth
Republic</ORGANIZATION>, of which <PERSON>Mitterrand</PERSON> was a leading figure; throughout the <DATE>1960s</DATE>,
<PERSON>Mitterrand</PERSON> denounced the illegitimacy of de Gaulle and the Fifth Republic;
and throughout the past 14 years the Gaullists have denounced the
illegitimacy of President <PERSON>Mitterrand</PERSON>.
This process is gathering momentum once more, in the run-up to next <DATE>spring</DATE>'s
presidential election. The conservatives ought to win that election easily.
Yet they are split on ancestrally visceral grounds, and could throw it all
away.
If they were to unite behind the candidacy of Prime Minister <PERSON>Edouard
Balladur</PERSON>, he would surely win. But it seems more likely that there will be
up to six rival candidates.
Personal ambition is not the only factor. <PERSON>Jacques Chirac</PERSON>, leader of the
Gaullist party, has been trying and failing to be president since <DATE>1981</DATE>, and
he will not give way now. But the undertow of the Chirac-Balladur struggle
is political legitimacy. Chirac has as few political principles as anyone;
but his claim to legitimacy and the loyalty of his party is that he is an
inheritor of genuine Gaullism, while <PERSON>Balladur</PERSON> is merely a modernising
conservative.
In <DATE>1988</DATE>, <PERSON>Chirac</PERSON> conducted his presidential campaign as farce. He frenziedly
paced up and down, calling on President <PERSON>Mitterrand</PERSON> to come out and fight.
Naturally, <PERSON>Mitterrand</PERSON> waited until Chirac had worn himself out, and then
took him to the cleaners.
Today Chirac is again frenziedly pacing up and down, calling for the
election to begin; once again he is likely to wear himself out - and split
the Gaullist party in two.
This intra-conservative struggle should be interesting and possibly
entertaining. We should remember that its historic roots pass through the
unexorcised trauma of Vichy.

FT  01 AUG 92 / As They Say in Europe: French replay a war crime
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
READING newspapers on holiday is the kind of activity for which there used
not to be a word. Today, we have re-invented 'disjunctive.' At least, I
think that is the word because it implies a lack of coherence between what
one is doing and the circumstances in which it is being done.
For the past two years, many have been alarmed on exotic beaches by reports
of distant crises, first in <LOCATION>Kuwait</LOCATION> then in <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION>. This time, we hoped to
avoid these guns of <DATE>August</DATE> by going to the <LOCATION>Dordogne</LOCATION> in <DATE>July</DATE>. But instead of
the echoes of present crises, the papers were full of the tragedy of half a
century before.
Most years at this time, there is mention of events in <DATE>July 1942</DATE> when the
French police rounded up thousands of naturalised French Jews and their
children and sent them to the death camps. Generically, the episode is known
as the Vel' d'Hiv', this being the abbreviation of the <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> winter cycling
stadium where the victims were held before transportation.
The 50th anniversary occasioned more heart-searching than ever. On <DATE>July 16</DATE>,
Liberation headlined its front page: '<LOCATION>France</LOCATION> faces up to its crimes.'
Figaro, meanwhile, interviewed the nazi-Hunter, <PERSON>Serge Klarsfeld</PERSON>, who said
<LOCATION>France</LOCATION> could not be blamed. More Jews had survived there than in other
occupied countries.
The debate dominated even the provincial press: Sud-Ouest ran related
stories for several days, headlining the 'lively polemic' the anniversary
had generated, along with President <PERSON>Mitterand</PERSON>'s presence at a commemorative
ceremony in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>.
One question at issue was the nature of the <PERSON>Vichy</PERSON> government, the
collaborationist regime that was presented by <PERSON>Marshal Petain</PERSON> as the true
successor of the 'Vraie <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>.' Vichy also was implicated in the atrocities
of the Vel' d'Hiv'. But were they the result of defeat and 'the criminal
madness of the occupying power,' as the mayor of <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Jacques Chirac</PERSON>, put
it? Or was it all, in a sense, a French responsibility?
This debate impinged on our holiday in a graphic manner. We were staying a
mile north of the <LOCATION>River Dronne</LOCATION>; the nearest town was Riberac, on the
southern bank. The <PERSON>Dronne</PERSON> was the frontier between occupied and <PERSON>Vichy
France</PERSON>, and the old <ORGANIZATION>Gestapo</ORGANIZATION> headquarters is one of the last buidings before
crossing into Riberac. A little to the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION> is the glade containing the
graves of the resistants shot by the <ORGANIZATION>Nazis</ORGANIZATION>.
What the newspapers were agonising over was whether that was a national
frontier - whether <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> existed south of the Dronne. It was this debate
that was more intense than on the other anniversaries of the events of <DATE>1942</DATE>.
This is partly because one or two of the most notable figures involved are
still at large, having sometimes been protected by the <ORGANIZATION>Roman Catholic Church</ORGANIZATION>
 -as the <ORGANIZATION>Church</ORGANIZATION>'s own astounded report showed earlier this year.
Opinion in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> has, if anything, hardened against the perpetrators in the
face of judicial complacency: almost three-quarters of the people want them
punished. The other quarter, one assumes, are don't-knows or supporters of
Jean-Marie Le Pen and the <ORGANIZATION>National Front</ORGANIZATION>.
The strength of the Front today has itself contributed to the debate over
the French past. The party stands for that constant strand in French
politics which, to say the least, is ambiguous about the Revolution.
It flaunts its sentimental religiosity, built around the cult of <PERSON>Joan of
Arc</PERSON>, and is a successor to the xenophobia of 'Action francaise' and the
racism of the <DATE>19th century</DATE>. Its ambiguous relationship with <PERSON>Vichy</PERSON> and
<PERSON>Marshal Petain</PERSON> is, therefore, a living embodiment of the debate.
A little over a year ago, the <ORGANIZATION>Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung</ORGANIZATION> ran a cartoon
showing history drawing a line under a page marked 'Post-war period.' That
optimistic assessment has turned out to be inaccurate.
The post-war period was frozen out by the Cold War and - as events all over
<LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> now show - has, in fact, only just begun.

<HEAD>Authorities Accused Of Reluctance To Try War Crimes Cases</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Lawyers and human rights activists say the
prosecution of three alleged Nazi collaborators has been stalled or
dragged out because of a reluctance to expose French complicity in
the <LOCATION>Holocaust</LOCATION>.
   War crimes charges against one of the men, <PERSON>Maurice Papon</PERSON>, have
been pending for seven years. Another, <PERSON>Rene Bousquet</PERSON>, was
implicated in <DATE>1949</DATE> for his activities as police chief in the <PERSON>Vichy</PERSON>
regime, but only now faces the possibility of a trial.
   The third alleged war criminal, <PERSON>Paul Touvier</PERSON>, is on trial for
his activities as a pro-Nazi militia chief in <LOCATION>Lyon</LOCATION>.
   Representatives of the <ORGANIZATION>International Federation of Human Rights</ORGANIZATION>
say authorities have failed to relieve the judge of other cases to
make the trial move more swiftly.
   ``We believe it is no accident that these three men have not
been tried,'' said <PERSON>Yves Jouffa</PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION>French League of
Human Rights</ORGANIZATION>, at a recent news conference.
   ``It is because they are part of what the English call the
establishment, whether it be in politics, business, industry or
high society.... This milieu does not want to see its dirty laundry
washed in public.''
   Bousquet, 81, headed the national police during the Nazi
occupation. State prosecutors last month asked that he be
investigated in connection with the deportation of 194 Jewish
children during the war.
   A <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> criminal court court ruled <DATE>Oct. 19</DATE> that <PERSON>Bousquet</PERSON> could
only be tried by the High Court of the Liberation, formed in <DATE>1944</DATE>
to prosecute officials of the <PERSON>Vichy</PERSON> regime. The Liberation court
has been defunct for decades, and the ruling by the <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> judges
indicated <PERSON>Bousquet</PERSON> would escape prosecution.
   However, at the request of state prosecutors, an appeals court
plans to make a final ruling on the jurisdiction issue <DATE>Nov. 19</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Serge Klarsfeld</PERSON>, a lawyer and prominent Nazi hunter, said senior
government officials, including President <PERSON>Francois Mitterrand</PERSON>,
appear reluctant to pursue the case.
   ``I think <PERSON>Mitterrand</PERSON> doesn't want this trial to open,''
<PERSON>Klarsfeld</PERSON> said. ``I can only hypothesize that there is a certain
indulgence toward <PERSON>Vichy</PERSON>.''
   Should the case go to trial, <PERSON>Bousquet</PERSON> would be the highest
ranking French official in the <PERSON>Vichy</PERSON> government to be tried for
crimes against humanity.
   Bousquet was condemned in <DATE>1949</DATE> for his activities under Nazi
occupation, but the decision was reversed for ``acts accomplished
in favor of the Resistance'' - namely, his decision to free some
jailed resistance fighters.
   Jouffa, who spent part of World War II in a French internment
camp, said none of the high-ranking French political figures with
direct roles in deporting and arresting 100,000 Jews during the war
have been brought to justice.
   He said the recent trial of the <ORGANIZATION>Gestapo</ORGANIZATION> chief in <LOCATION>Lyon</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Klaus
Barbie</PERSON>, ``was the trial of <LOCATION>Nazi Germany</LOCATION>, not collaborationist
<LOCATION>France</LOCATION>.
   The human rights federation said it had organized an inquiry
commission to determine why the cases were taking so long. Their
report is being submitted to the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION> and the Council of
<LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>.
   ``We hope that the very fact that we have carried out this
mission will be enough to create movement in high places and allow
these proceedings to be accelerated,'' <PERSON>Jouffa</PERSON> said.
   Papon, a former budget minister, has been accused of
responsibility for the arrests and deportations of 1,700 Jews while
an administrator in <LOCATION>Bordeaux</LOCATION> during the war. Now 81, he served in
many high-profile positions after the war, including a stint as
<LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> police chief.
   Touvier, 75, worked with <ORGANIZATION>Barbie</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Lyon</LOCATION>. He went into hiding in
<DATE>1973</DATE>, and was arrested in <DATE>May 1989</DATE> at a priory in Nice run by
followers of Archbishop <PERSON>Marcel Lefevbre</PERSON>, the fundamentalist Roman
Catholic leader.

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A court ruled <DATE>Monday</DATE> that a Frenchman accused of
sending 194 Jewish children to their deaths in <LOCATION>Nazi</LOCATION> camps can be
tried for war crimes.
   <PERSON>Rene Bousquet</PERSON>, 81, who is accused of crimes against humanity,
was national police chief under the collaborating <PERSON>Vichy</PERSON> government
in World War II.
   Appeals Court <PERSON>Judge Albert Moatty</PERSON> decided <DATE>Monday</DATE> that <PERSON>Bousquet</PERSON>
can be tried by an ordinary court.
   State prosecutors in <DATE>September</DATE> asked that <PERSON>Bousquet</PERSON> be
investigated in connection with the childrens' deportation.
   A lower court held in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> last month that <PERSON>Bousquet</PERSON> could be
tried only by the High Court of the Liberation, formed in <DATE>1944</DATE> to
prosecute officials of the government under Nazi occupation. That
court has been defunct for decades.
   Moatty's ruling allowed state prosecutors to resume their
investigation of evidence uncovered by Nazi-hunters.
   The <ORGANIZATION>International League Against Racism</ORGANIZATION> and Anti-Semitism hailed
the decision. ``<LOCATION>France</LOCATION> is a great country, capable of looking into
the dark times of its past,'' the group said in a statement.
   The lower court's ruling had infuriated human rights activists,
who feared <PERSON>Bousquet</PERSON> would escape prosecution.
   Rights leaders say no high-ranking French officials directly
involved in deporting and arresting 100,000 Jews during the war
have been brought to trial.
   <PERSON>Serge Klarsfeld</PERSON>, a lawyer and prominent Nazi-hunter, has said
senior government officials, including President <PERSON>Francois
Mitterrand</PERSON>, appear reluctant to pursue the case.
   Bousquet was condemned in <DATE>1949</DATE> for alleged collaboration with
the <ORGANIZATION>Nazis</ORGANIZATION>, but was freed for ``acts accomplished in favor of the
Resistance.'' He freed some jailed Resistance fighters when he was
ousted from his post.
   A federation of human rights groups organized an inquiry
commission to determine why cases against <PERSON>Bousquet</PERSON> and two other
suspected war criminals, <PERSON>Paul Touvier</PERSON> and <PERSON>Maurice Papon</PERSON>, have taken
so long.
   Touvier, 75, is being prosecuted for his activities as a
pro-Nazi militia chief in <LOCATION>Lyon</LOCATION>. He was captured last year after
spending years hiding out with the help of right-wing Roman
Catholic monks.
   Charges against <PERSON>Papon</PERSON>, a former budget minister, have been
pending for seven years. He has been accused of being responsible
for the arrests and deportations of 1,700 Jews while a wartime
administrator in <LOCATION>Bordeaux</LOCATION>.

FT  14 SEP 94 / Mitterrand's 'clarification' adds to confusion: After 14
years in power, the man and his image are crumbling fast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Think of all those between the ages of 15 and 20. Ever since they became
conscious of the political life of their country, all they have ever seen is
me.
Two months since saying this, and in the 14th year of his presidency,
President <PERSON>Francois Mitterrand</PERSON> and his image seem to be crumbling fast.
On <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>, the French president underwent 90 minutes of questioning on
television, ostensibly to clarify comments he had made about his health and
his political past.
Yet, still, he raised more questions than he answered. This was probably
inevitable in the case of his health, given that the precise pace of <PERSON>Mr
Mitterrand</PERSON>'s prostate cancer is unknown. But what he has done is plunge
French politicians into an early race to take his place in the <LOCATION>Elysee</LOCATION> next
<DATE>May</DATE> - or earlier.
The revelations could prove a setback for his own Socialist party - and
perhaps give a boost to the far right.
Immediate reactions to <PERSON>Mr Mitterrand</PERSON>'s TV interview were mixed. Some praised
the president's courage in talking about his cancer, and his candour in
tracing his move from the political right to the left; from his pre-war
conservative upbringing eventually to socialism.
Others said they were moved, but used the word 'pathetic'.
<PERSON>Mr Rene Monory</PERSON>, the centrist president of the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> who would take over as
interim head of state if the president died in office or resigned, said: 'I
was a little sorry to see the president explain himself in such a way . . .
it does not usually end this way'.
Others complained that <PERSON>Mr Mitterrand</PERSON> was over-stretching their credulity in
asserting that, when he went to work for the <PERSON>Vichy</PERSON> collaborationist
government in <DATE>1942</DATE>, he knew nothing of the anti-semitic laws it had passed
in <DATE>1940</DATE>; and that only in <DATE>1986</DATE> did he have cause to break off contact with
<PERSON>Mr Rene Bousquet</PERSON>, the ex-Vichy police chief. But even yesterday <PERSON>Mr
Mitterrand</PERSON> had a Jewish defender in <PERSON>Mr George Kiejman</PERSON>, his former justice
minister, who came to his aid against sharp criticism from <PERSON>Mr Serge
Klarsfeld</PERSON>, <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>'s best-known Nazi hunter.
But much of the French right believes the left has walked into its own trap
in identifying itself so strongly with the resistance. Certainly, some
Socialists - though not those at the very top - were yesterday expressing
their 'disgust and bitterness' at <PERSON>Mr Mitterrand</PERSON>, and calling for 'a break
with Mitterrandism'. This is defined as a form of persistent 'ambiguity' in
personal and political relations.
The fact that this ambiguity seems to have persisted right into the
<PERSON>Mitterrand</PERSON> presidency appears most to upset the French Communist party,
which was only allowed by <ORGANIZATION>Stalin</ORGANIZATION> to enter the anti-German resistance after
<DATE>1941</DATE>.
In a new book on the president entitled 'The Right Hand of God', three
French journalists claim <PERSON>Mr Mitterrand</PERSON> has consistently sought to divide the
right by promoting and wooing <PERSON>Mr Jean-Marie</PERSON> Le Pen's <ORGANIZATION>National Front</ORGANIZATION>.
In <DATE>1982</DATE>, they claim, President <PERSON>Mitterrand</PERSON> arranged for the <ORGANIZATION>NF</ORGANIZATION> to get
increased coverage on state television; and between the two rounds of the
<DATE>1988</DATE> election, asked <PERSON>Mr Le Pen</PERSON> to swing his vote behind him rather than the
gaullist candidate, <PERSON>Mr Jacques Chirac</PERSON>. These claims are denied by close
Mitterrand associates. But it is true that the introduction of proportional
representation in the <DATE>1986</DATE> parliamentary elections, designed primarily to
minimise Socialist losses, had the side effect of helping the <ORGANIZATION>NF</ORGANIZATION>.
Yesterday a senior <ORGANIZATION>NF</ORGANIZATION> party official suggested that 'if <PERSON>Francois Mitterrand</PERSON>
was elected despite his real flirt with <PERSON>Vichy</PERSON>, then Jean-Marie Le Pen can be
elected despite his false image as a Vichyist'. This, too, stretches belief.
But it is likely that <PERSON>Mr Le Pen</PERSON>, who is due next <DATE>Sunday</DATE> to become the first
declared candidate for the <DATE>1995</DATE> presidential race, will try to turn <PERSON>Mr
Mitterrand</PERSON>'s revelations to his own benefit.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister <PERSON>Edouard Balladur</PERSON> will try to keep his government
ticking over until early <DATE>1995</DATE> when he intends to announce his own
presidential candidacy, against, among others, that of <PERSON>Mr Chirac</PERSON>.
But the weekly cabinet meetings on <DATE>Wednesdays</DATE>, over which <PERSON>Mr Mitterrand</PERSON>
presides, will become even more curious affairs. The president will be
watching for divisions in the government which he might divulge publicly, as
he did last week to Le Figaro newspaper. Among his ministers, the rival
Balladur and Chirac clans will be on the lookout for any sign of increasing
presidential infirmity to send them to the hustings.

<TEXT>
   An appeals court today gave ordinary criminal
courts jurisdiction to try a former French official accused of
sending 194 Jewish children to their deaths in concentration camps
during World War II.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Paris Court of Appeals</ORGANIZATION> overturned a lower court ruling last
month <PERSON>Rene Bousquet</PERSON> could only be tried by the High Court of the
Liberation, formed in <DATE>1944</DATE> to prosecute officials of the
collaborationist <PERSON>Vichy</PERSON> government. The court has been defunct for
decades.
   Court of Appeals President <PERSON>Albert Moatty</PERSON> ruled today that the
length of time required to reconstitute the court could preclude
justice in the case of <PERSON>Bousquet</PERSON>, who is 81.
   With <ORGANIZATION>Moatty</ORGANIZATION>'s ruling, state prosecutors can resume their
investigation of evidence on <PERSON>Bousquet</PERSON>'s case that was provided by
Nazi hunters.
   Bousquet headed the national police during the Nazi occupation
of <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>. State prosecutors in <DATE>September</DATE> asked that he be
investigated in connection with the deportation of 194 Jewish
children during the war.
   Should the case go to trial, <PERSON>Bousquet</PERSON> would be the

crimes against humanity.
   But <PERSON>Serge Klarsfeld</PERSON>, a lawyer and prominent Nazi hunter, has

   Bousquet was condemned in <DATE>1949</DATE> for his wartime activities, but
the decision was reversed due to ``acts accomplished in favor of
the Resistance'' - namely his decision to free some jailed
Resistance fighters at the time he was ousted from his post.
   Human rights leaders say none of the high-ranking French

<HEAD>French Commemorate Charles De Gaulle's Call To Arms Against Nazis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARILYN AUGUST</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The French are celebrating with unprecedented
fanfare the 50th anniversary of <PERSON>Charles De Gaulle</PERSON>'s historic appeal
for armed resistance against Nazi tyranny.
   Yet few people actually heard the radio broadcast, and many
French people _ though they might deny it now _ were content with
the leaders who had just surrendered to Hitler.
   Known as the ``appel'' of <DATE>June 18</DATE>, De Gaulle's fervent,
four-minute speech was addressed to soldiers and civilians in
<LOCATION>England</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>.
   In a deep, gravelly voice edged with tension, he asked: ``Must
we abandon all hope? Is our defeat final? No! ... <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> is not
alone! ... The flame of French resistance must not and shall not
die!''
   But the army was in disarray, and most civilians were fleeing
their homes. The chaos and panic were such that 90,000 families
reported having lost children during the mass exodus.
   Many of those who did manage to tune in the <ORGANIZATION>BBC</ORGANIZATION> on their wartime
wireless radios sought assurances from 84-year-old <PERSON>Philippe Petain</PERSON>,
a bemedalled World War I field marshal who had urged Premier <PERSON>Paul
Reynaud</PERSON> to sign the armistice the previous day.
   <PERSON>Regis Debray</PERSON>, a former adviser to President <PERSON>Francois Mitterrand</PERSON>,
has suggested in a recent book that in <DATE>June 1940</DATE>, nine out of 10
French supported <PERSON>Petain</PERSON>. In fact, by the end of the <DATE>summer</DATE>, only
7,000 people had reached <LOCATION>De Gaulle</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> headquarters.
   The vast majority of the French saw De Gaulle as a brash rebel
who fled his native soil hours after <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> capitulated _ to join
forces with an old enemy, <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>.
   By contrast, the grandfatherly, taciturn <PERSON>Petain</PERSON>, known as ``the
hero of <LOCATION>Verdun</LOCATION>,'' urged an end to the conflict, which he believed
<LOCATION>France</LOCATION> could never win.
   Petain's popularity began to fade only after Vichy-led police
zealously rounded up Jews for deportation to concentration camps _
123,000 died _ and began sending French workers to <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>.
   Fifty years later, the French are celebrating their national
hero unreservedly _ with virtually no reminders of the
collaborationist regime or tolerance of Nazism that De Gaulle
vigorously condemned.
   Instead, politicians try to capitalize on his legacy, each vying
to appear as his heir.
   Sound and light extravaganzas will re-enact the dramatic moments
of the war, including the Nazi invasion, the <DATE>June 18</DATE> appeal and the
liberation.
   <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> has been plastered with 6,000 posters recalling the
highlights of De Gaulle's career. Art exhibitions, documentaries
and television specials _ even a computer game _ recapture the
grandeur and charisma of ``le General.''
   A giant replica of the wireless _ the kind that ordinary
citizens would later risk their lives listening to _ will be
erected at the <ORGANIZATION>Place de la Concorde</ORGANIZATION> and will broadcast De Gaulle's
wartime speeches from dawn to dusk on <DATE>June 18</DATE>.
   Retired Gen. <PERSON>Andre Delpech</PERSON>, a resistance fighter who was
tortured and sent to <LOCATION>Dachau</LOCATION> in <DATE>1944</DATE>, remembers the excitement of
the <DATE>June 18</DATE> appeal. He was then 15.
   ``Somehow, news had reached our remote hamlet that some general,
whose name we didn't know, was going to make an important speech
from <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>. We could barely make out his voice... Afterwards, the
adults stayed up long into the night discussing the few sentences
they managed to decipher.''
   Meanwhile, radio announcers reread the appeal during the evening
and into the wee hours of the <TIME>morning</TIME>. The following day De Gaulle
again took the microphone to express his firm belief that he
``spoke in the name of <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>.''
   ``Ici Londres'' _ ``This is <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>'' _ became a codeword for the
resistance, opening nightly broadcasts that provided news from the
free world and transmitted coded messages to underground networks
in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>.
   Political journalist <PERSON>Robert Quiriconi</PERSON> was a high school student
in <LOCATION>Algeria</LOCATION> when De Gaulle founded the Free French movement and
hoisted the French tricolor over his <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> home.
   ``At flag-raising ceremonies, we were supposed to sing a song
praising <PERSON>Petain</PERSON> instead of the `Marseillaise,''' he said. ``I had
heard about De Gaulle from my classmates, and from then on, we were
Gaullists, and refused to sing.''

   Hundreds of former resistance fighters joined

aganst inhuman and totalitarian ambition.''
   Later, many dignitaries and resistance veterans looked on as
President <PERSON>Francois Mitterrand</PERSON> unveiled a plaque at the Arc de
Triomphe inscribed with the text of <ORGANIZATION>De Gaulle</ORGANIZATION>'s appeal. Church
bells throughout <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> chimed to mark the occasion.
   Thousands of tourists and Parisians flocked <DATE>Monday</DATE> to the <ORGANIZATION>Place
de la Concorde</ORGANIZATION>, where a 115-foot-high replica of a <DATE>1940s</DATE> radio
re-broadcast the <DATE>June 18</DATE> call from <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> and other well-known De
Gaulle speeches.
   Few of <ORGANIZATION>De Gaulle</ORGANIZATION>'s countrymen actually heard his dramatic
appeal, in a voice edged with tension: ``Has the last word been
said? Must we abandon all hope? Is our defeat final? No! ... <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>
is not alone ... the flame of the resistance must not and shall not
die.''
   Many of those who did manage to tune in the <ORGANIZATION>BBC</ORGANIZATION> to hear it knew
little about the general claiming to represent <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>. Instead,
they preferred the grandfatherly reassurances of <PERSON>Philippe Petain</PERSON>, a
World War I field marshal, who urged surrender to the Germans.
Petain became the head of the collaborationist <PERSON>Vichy</PERSON> regime.
   De Gaulle's fervent, four-minute speech helped change the course
of French history.
   The resistance movement played a critical role in the Allied
victory. After the war, De Gaulle founded a political party and
served as president from <DATE>1959</DATE> to <DATE>1969</DATE>. He died a year later.
   Daylong celebrations of <ORGANIZATION>De Gaulle</ORGANIZATION>'s broadcast culminated <DATE>Monday</DATE>
<TIME>night</TIME> with a sound and light extravaganza on the <LOCATION>Seine River</LOCATION>.
   More than 100,000 spectators crowded onto river banks and
bridges to watch as scores of barges floated down the Seine
carrying torches, flags and hundreds of performers in period
costume reenacting the German invasion of <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>De Gaulle</ORGANIZATION>'s
flight to <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, D-Day and the liberation.
   The show included simulations of the bombings raids that
terrified civilians when <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> fell. At that time, three-fifths of
the population took to the roads in cars, wagons, bicycles and even
wheelbarrows to escape the German onslaught.
   The show, which also celebrates the centenary of <ORGANIZATION>De Gaulle</ORGANIZATION>'s
birth, cost <MONEY>$5.7 million</MONEY>, raised from private sources by <ORGANIZATION>De Gaulle
Centenary Association</ORGANIZATION>.
   Early <DATE>Monday</DATE>, vandals demaged and defaced De Gaulle memorials in
three communities on the northern outskirts of <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>, police said.
No arrests were reported.

<TEXT>
   Savagely attacking <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION> a
half-century ago, <PERSON>Adolf Hitler</PERSON>'s armies sparked a conflagration
that killed more than 50 million people and spread worldwide in
history's costliest war.
   World War II drew in every major power, leaving behind a bitter
legacy from fighting and Holocaust that shape the thinking of
nations to this day.
   The reverberations range from the tensions between the
capitalist West and communist East to lingering uneasiness over the
possibility of ever reunifying the two Germanys.
   And there are more individual problems, such as in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, with
the diplomatic difficulties that arose over the attendance of
foreign dignitaries at the funeral of Emperor <PERSON>Hirohito</PERSON> last
<DATE>February</DATE>, and in <LOCATION>Austria</LOCATION>, where President <PERSON>Kurt Waldheim</PERSON>'s war
record as a German officer is under divisive scrutiny.
   The Holocaust _ the <ORGANIZATION>Nazis</ORGANIZATION>' extermination of an estimated 6
million Jews _ shocked the world like no other atrocity known to
mankind and still casts the longest shadow of the war.
   Last <DATE>November</DATE>, <PERSON>Philipp Jenninger</PERSON> had to resign as speaker of the
West German Parliament just 48 hours after making a clumsily worded
speech that sought to explain the German people's anti-Semitism and
fascination with <PERSON>Hitler</PERSON>.
   However good his intentions, Jenninger offended many Germans,
Jewish and non-Jewish.
   The war is remembered, too, in small, day-to-day details, like
the seats reserved for war invalids on French trains, or the
Christmas tree in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Trafalgar Square</LOCATION>, an annual gift from a
grateful Norwegian people for the British war effort.
   It was an arena for giants, good and bad: Hitler, <ORGANIZATION>Winston
Churchill</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Josef Stalin</PERSON>, <PERSON>Franklin Roosevelt</PERSON>. And it produced
postwar leaders such as <PERSON>Charles de Gaulle</PERSON>, architect of modern
<LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, and <PERSON>Marshal Josip Broz Tito</PERSON>, who ruled <LOCATION>Yugoslavia</LOCATION> until his
death in <DATE>1980</DATE> and helped found the movement of non-aligned nations.
   Every nation shapes its own lessons from the war, often with
distortions or exaggerations.
   For the French, there is the painful knowledge that one's
parents or grandparents may have collaborated with their Nazi
conquerors.
   For <LOCATION>Eastern Europe</LOCATION>, decades of official hero-worship of the
Soviet forces are giving way to greater objectivity, in large part
as a result of Soviet President <PERSON>Mikhail S. Gorbachev</PERSON>'s policy of
openness.
   ``In the vision of the war we used to get, only the Russians
were brave in fighting the Germans,'' said <PERSON>Anna Radziwill</PERSON>, who has
taught high school history for 30 years and was elected to <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION>'s
newly created <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``The vision of the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION> was that they were just sending us
canned food,'' said <PERSON>Ms. Radziwill</PERSON>, a member of one of <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION>'s old
noble families.
   German sailors aboard the old battleship Schleswig-Holstein
fired the first shots of World War II, shelling a small Polish
garrison at <LOCATION>Westerplatte</LOCATION> near the <ORGANIZATION>Free City of Danzig</ORGANIZATION> at <TIME>4:45 a.m.</TIME>
on <DATE>Sept. 1, 1939</DATE>. The German army poured across the Polish frontier
while <PERSON>Hitler</PERSON>'s warplanes pounded the country from overhead.
   Two days later <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> declared war on <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>. But
not until <DATE>1941</DATE> did the fighting become a true world war, with the
German invasion of the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> and the Japanese attack on the
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> fleet at <LOCATION>Pearl Harbor</LOCATION>. In all, more than 50 nations joined the
fighting.
   Still uneasy neighbors 40 years after their creation, the two
Germanys present vastly different accounts of World War II and its
causes.
   In communist <LOCATION>East Germany</LOCATION>, a high school textbook from <DATE>1986</DATE>
states: ``World War II was unleashed by German imperialists and
militarists,'' spurred by a desire for profits and conquests.
   But just over the border, teen-agers in <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION>'s Hesse
state are taught that Nazism was an all-embracing affair, ``a
terrible aberration to which an entire people was able to be driven
by ideological blindness, ignorance and cowardice.''
   Revised history books for Soviet high school students still
insist <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION>'s forces defeated <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> virtually single-handed, even
though the <ORGANIZATION>Kremlin</ORGANIZATION> did not declare war on <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> until three days
after a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> bomber dropped an atomic bomb on <LOCATION>Hiroshima</LOCATION>.
   The textbook for the 11th grade says that ``the use of the
atomic weapon was not militarily necessary.''
   ``By this crime, unprecedented in the history of mankind,
imperialist circles in the <LOCATION>U.S.A.</LOCATION> wanted to demonstrate its
then-strategic superiority before the whole world,'' the textbook
says.
   But Soviet students do learn that their country's agreement to
divide up <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION> with the Germans was unjust.
   In <LOCATION>Warsaw</LOCATION>, a newly emboldened Communist government is moving
closer to blaming the Soviets for the massacre of more than 4,000
Polish officers in <LOCATION>Katyn</LOCATION>. To reverse the official line _ that the
<PERSON>Nazis</PERSON> did it _ would constitute a monumental act of historical
revisionism in East European minds.
   <PERSON>Momo Kapor</PERSON>, a best-selling Yugoslav author and satirist, summed
up the distortions of the past this way: ``During the past 40 years
or so, grandpas and grandmas, uncles and old aunts have been
correcting, secretly, official lessons from textbooks.
   ``From our earliest days, to finish school somehow, we had to
pretend that we believed in official stories, while in fact we
believed in things that were forbidden,'' <PERSON>Kapor</PERSON> said in a recent
column in the <LOCATION>Belgrade</LOCATION> daily newspaper Politika.
   While <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> remains unabashedly proud of its wartime role,
other Western European nations, such as <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>, have had
to face up to the darker side of their war record.
   <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> was easily defeated in <DATE>1940</DATE> and was then divided into an
occupied zone and a French puppet regime headquartered in the town
of <LOCATION>Vichy</LOCATION>. The Germans later occupied the whole country.
   Historian <PERSON>Henri Rousso</PERSON> said in an interview that many fellow
Frenchmen have long thought their country was made up mostly of
brave resistance fighters who ultimately helped the Allied victory.
He said textbooks began to tell a different story in the early
<DATE>1970s</DATE>.
   French Nazi hunter <PERSON>Serge Klarsfeld</PERSON> said many French people do
not know that the country ``actively collaborated with the Germans.
And thanks to de Gaulle's diplomatic genius, many French people
think that <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> really won the war.''
   ``The period was like a civil war, with two opposite camps: de
Gaulle and the resistance on one side, and the <PERSON>Vichy</PERSON>
collaborationist regime on the other,'' <PERSON>Klarsfeld</PERSON> said in an
interview.
   <PERSON>Alessia Jannece</PERSON>, a high school student in <LOCATION>Rome</LOCATION>, said: ``They
really don't teach us much about fascism. I learn mostly from TV or
what I remember from middle school.''
   The lessons are important for a country haunted by its past
under fascist dictator <PERSON>Benito Mussolini</PERSON>. Professor <ORGANIZATION>Renzo De
Felice</ORGANIZATION>'s highly respected <DATE>1982</DATE> biography of <PERSON>Mussolini</PERSON> contends
there was general consensus for fascism in <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>.
   Last year's 50th anniversary of <LOCATION>Austria</LOCATION>'s annexation by <LOCATION>Nazi
Germany</LOCATION> and a select commission's finding that <PERSON>Waldheim</PERSON> was in
``close proximity'' to <ORGANIZATION>Nazi</ORGANIZATION> war crimes also prompted soul-searching.
   ``Although the <ORGANIZATION>Second World War</ORGANIZATION> is now far distant, its shadows
are long, its echoes loud,'' British historian <PERSON>Martin Gilbert</PERSON> says
in a new history of the war. ``How else could it be with an event,
lasting for nearly six years, in which courage and cruelty, hope
and horror, violence and virtue, massacre and survival, were so
closely intertwined?''

ASSASSINATION IN <LOCATION>ALGIERS</LOCATION> by <PERSON>Anthony Verrier Macmillan</PERSON> Pounds 20, 302 pages
ON CHRISTMAS Eve, <DATE>1942</DATE>, 21-year-old <PERSON>Fernand Bonnier</PERSON> fired two shots into the
stomach of <PERSON>Jean-Francois Darlan</PERSON>, the Vichy leader in <LOCATION>North Africa</LOCATION>. Two hours
later Admiral <PERSON>Darlan</PERSON> died. The assassin, who had expected to escape, was
shot after a court martial in <LOCATION>Algiers</LOCATION>. Behind this assassination was a
complex and tangled story which <PERSON>Anthony Verrier</PERSON> has tried to unravel using
British and American secret service papers and interviews with informed
British and French respondents to compensate for the lack of officially
available documents.
The <PERSON>Darlan</PERSON> saga was part of a series of conflicts not easy to explore in a
short book. The most important was the growing divergence between the
pro-Vichy and savagely anti-Gaullist <PERSON>Roosevelt</PERSON>, who believed Darlan could
deliver <LOCATION>North Africa</LOCATION> into Allied hands, and <ORGANIZATION>Winston Churchill</ORGANIZATION>, favourably
disposed towards de Gaulle despite moments of irritation bordering on fury
and with a far more realistic view of the Vichy gamble. Having persuaded the
Americans to invade <LOCATION>North Africa</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Churchill</ORGANIZATION> found it necessary to propitiate
Roosevelt by acquiescing in the president's pro-Vichy line without
abandoning his preferred alternative.
The divisions between Frenchmen were even more complicated. The situation in
<LOCATION>North Africa</LOCATION> differed markedly from that in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>. The main contenders for
control in <LOCATION>Algiers</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Darlan</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Giraud</PERSON> and de Gaulle, each had wider political
ambitions which made control of <LOCATION>North Africa</LOCATION> pertinent to the French
situation. In <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, the London-backed Resistance looked to de Gaulle, and
by <DATE>1942</DATE> the British were pledged to the Gaullists though many had strong
doubts about their leader.
In the overwhelmingly pro-Vichy <LOCATION>North Africa</LOCATION>, the Gaullist element
represented a tiny minority. Time and circumstance determined local
loyalties; supporters hedged their bets and changed sides. Roosevelt's
political emissary, <PERSON>Robert Murphy</PERSON>, was lost in this quagmire of shifting
political alliance. He ultimately opted for Darlan who, as <ORGANIZATION>Verrier</ORGANIZATION> confirms,
ran circles around the American. The British had no equivalent political
figure in <LOCATION>Algiers</LOCATION> until <PERSON>Harold Macmillan</PERSON> in <DATE>1943</DATE>, but they had two SOE
missions in place, '<PERSON>Brandon</PERSON>' and '<PERSON>Massingham</PERSON>', building up an anti-Vichy
front.
The real Anglo-American divide came with the bargain struck in <DATE>November,
1942</DATE> between Darlan and General <PERSON>Mark Clark</PERSON> confirming the former's authority
over <LOCATION>North Africa</LOCATION> in return for a French ceasefire. Eisenhower, in command
of 'Torch', was to remain loyal to this bargain despite growing doubts about
<PERSON>Darlan</PERSON>'s loyalty. On the British side, after months of equivocation in
<LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, it was agreed that <PERSON>Darlan</PERSON> was an impossible choice. The British were
committed to de Gaulle and the Free French.
Diplomatic pressure from the British and Gaullists failed to move the
Americans. In this unequal contest, the British felt forced to turn to
clandestine operations. It is at this point that <PERSON>Verrier</PERSON>'s account is of
gripping interest and where his reconstruction of events, if accurate, makes
for fascinating reading. All the tangled threads are brought together. If,
as the author argues, there was no concerted plan to eliminate <PERSON>Darlan</PERSON>, the
measures taken by <ORGANIZATION>British Intelligence</ORGANIZATION> described in this chapter made his
assassination inevitable.
<PERSON>Desmond Morton</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Churchill</ORGANIZATION>'s chief intelligence adviser, was involved, and
<PERSON>Colonel Keswick</PERSON>, second in command of '<PERSON>Massingham</PERSON>', began new operations in
the murky world of <LOCATION>Algiers</LOCATION>. There was a key meeting in <LOCATION>Gibraltar</LOCATION>, on
<DATE>December 4</DATE>, with <PERSON>Morton</PERSON> present, for those to be involved in <LOCATION>Darlan</LOCATION>'s
removal. <PERSON>Henri d'Astier</PERSON>, an equivocal figure serving on <ORGANIZATION>Darlan</ORGANIZATION>'s staff, was
recruited to operate covertly with the British and given funds by <ORGANIZATION>OSS</ORGANIZATION>; his
brothers, <PERSON>Jean Bernard</PERSON> and General <PERSON>Francoise d'Astier</PERSON>, were with de Gaulle;
the latter was sent to <LOCATION>Algiers</LOCATION> for discussions with an unwelcoming
<PERSON>Eisenhower</PERSON> but also to warn <PERSON>Henri</PERSON> that the Gaullists should lie low,
The final role was played by <PERSON>Bonnier</PERSON>, one of a small group of young
anti-Darlan Frenchmen, who had been given uniforms, rations and pay by
'<PERSON>Brandon</PERSON>'. On <DATE>November 18</DATE>, <PERSON>Bonnier</PERSON> to his horror drew the short straw.
Verrier cannot say what or who finally pushed <PERSON>Bonnier</PERSON> over the edge. Giraud,
though absent from <LOCATION>Algiers</LOCATION> at the time, took power, wasting little sympathy
on Darlan but demanding that Bonnier be tried. At his court martial the
young man claimed to have acted alone. It was decided by d'Astier that he
was not to be rescued. The Darlanites had a victim; the anti-Vichyites a
youthful martyr. Verrier provides vivid descriptions of the clean-up
operations in <LOCATION>Algiers</LOCATION> and the subsequent contest between <PERSON>Giraud</PERSON> and de
Gaulle.
There is much new material here and the discriminating reader will be richly
rewarded. The difficulty is that this book falls between two stools. Despite
<PERSON>Verrier</PERSON>'s efforts and simplification, the general reader will find this a
tangled trail to follow. The better informed will bridle at some of the
author's unqualified generalisations and at the lack of any but the most
perfunctory scholarly apparatus.
The author has shown in previous studies that he has special access to
intelligence sources. Many of his most startling disclosures have been
confirmed by papers that have come into the public domain. In this account,
however, references to open sources are unacceptably sparse, irregular, and
incomplete. The notes are tantalisingly brief. No one is helped by the fact
that this book is badly written. One cannot help but feel that <PERSON>Verrier</PERSON> had a
different book in mind. The result is everyone's loss.

FT  17 SEP 94 / As They Say in Europe: A French youth, free of innocence

<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Suppose <PERSON>Edward Heath</PERSON>, the British prime minister from <DATE>1970</DATE> to <DATE>1974</DATE>, had been
mixed up with <PERSON>Oswald Moseley</PERSON>'s fascist movement in the <DATE>1930s</DATE> and had helped
draw up a list of undesirables to help an eventual occupying power.
Even in secretive <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> it might have emerged that he was not, perhaps, a
wholly suitable potential leader. At the very least the cabinet secretary
would have been tipped off by the head of MI5: 'Ted hasn't got 20 shillings
for the pound,' or some such argot would have scuppered him.
In <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, things are different. A bit of fascist collusion for a man of
<PERSON>Francois Mitterrand</PERSON>'s generation was not exceptional. Then a bit of light
work on the other side and one could emerge from the cocoon of collaboration
as a butterfly of the resistance. But <PERSON>Mitterrand</PERSON>, at a time of his own
choosing, has co-operated in revealing the truth about his past. Admittedly
the French president did wait until the last days of his presidency and
maybe his life, to come clean, but come clean he did in backing the now
well-known book by <PERSON>Pierre Pean</PERSON>, Une jeunesse francaise.
That, and the serious worries about his health, led to a long television
interview on <DATE>Monday</DATE>. There, <PERSON>Mitterrand</PERSON> argued that he had not done much that
was wrong. He had been a bit late in changing sides. He had befriended the
man who had been the <ORGANIZATION>Nazis</ORGANIZATION>' manager of the Holocaust in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Rene
Bousquet</PERSON>. But <PERSON>Bousquet</PERSON> had been publicly cleared, even though his associates
had left nobody in any doubt as to his central role in the matter.
The newspapers reacted diversely. Liberation said that anyone looking for a
mea culpa when it came to <PERSON>Bousquet</PERSON> might well have spared themselves the
trouble. One provincial paper thought the president could end his term with
a clear conscience.
There was alarm about the role of the press in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, but even that took
different forms. Le <PERSON>Figaro</PERSON> said the press had turned on <LOCATION>Mitterrand</LOCATION> as it had
turned on other presidents at the end of their reign. But, as is usual with
<PERSON>Le Figaro</PERSON>, the reality is different. Most facts about <PERSON>Mitterrand</PERSON>, it seems,
were, by and large, in or near the public domain. It would not have taken
much to show he was on the fringes of the nastier xenophobic groups in the
<DATE>1930s</DATE> and that he dined with <PERSON>Bousquet</PERSON> in the <DATE>1980s</DATE>. After all, he put a
wreath on the tomb of the Vichy leader, <PERSON>Marshall Petain</PERSON>, annually until
public opinion forced a change a few years ago.
So the question is, why was it that the truth did not come out until
<PERSON>Mitterrand</PERSON> licensed it? Only Le <PERSON>Monde</PERSON> has taken this question to heart. Its
in-house ombudsman, <PERSON>Andre Laurens</PERSON>, wrote a 5,000 word piece headed:
'<PERSON>Francois Mitterrand</PERSON> under the eye of Le Monde.' He explained how the paper
had played a vital role in exposing the many scandals of his reign and got
into trouble as a result: 'The irony is that the paper is reproached on the
one hand for not having told what it did not and could not know, and on the
other for not having believed the statements of public figures.'
Those who expose unpleasant secrets in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> do get into trouble. But the
problem of <PERSON>Mitterrand</PERSON> runs deeper than that. The French cannot resolve it.
They like to think <PERSON>Charles de Gaulle</PERSON> was the presidential incarnation of
<LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, but of course the truth is that <PERSON>Mitterrand</PERSON> is the mirror of the
nation. He is the two <PERSON>Frances</PERSON>, the nation of the enlightenment, the
revolution and liberty. And of xenophobia, anti-republicanism and
intolerance.
Mitterrand symbolises the contradictory aspects of <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>'s recent past  -
the ideological opportunism and the unique nature of French collaboration
with the <ORGANIZATION>Nazis</ORGANIZATION>, the myths of the resistance, the creation of a successful
modern state and the continuity of pointless minorities on the far left and
far right.
The <ORGANIZATION>National Front</ORGANIZATION> leapt to his defence. Its weekly, <ORGANIZATION>National-Hebdo</ORGANIZATION>, ran the
headline, 'Nothing to get excited about' and reported that anybody who had
read the far-right press would have been familiar with all <PERSON>Mitterrand</PERSON>'s
transactions with the <PERSON>Vichy</PERSON> regime and he had done nothing wrong anyway.
The curious fact is that <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>'s great figures, unlike <LOCATION>Mitterrand</LOCATION>, always
emerge from some glorious national salon des refuses. They are outsiders -
<PERSON>Henri IV</PERSON> and <PERSON>Napoleon</PERSON>, or rejects and rebels - <ORGANIZATION>Voltaire</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Lavoisier</PERSON>, <PERSON>Victor
Hugo</PERSON> and de Gaulle.
In <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>, by contrast, all national heroes - <LOCATION>Elizabeth</LOCATION> I, <ORGANIZATION>Shakespeare</ORGANIZATION>,
<PERSON>Adam Smith</PERSON> - were heroes to their contemporaries. Sometimes that is a fluke
of history. No British leader could have faced the choices that confronted
Mitterrand: none could have supplied appropriately damaging material for a
sensational political biography called 'A Youth of an Englishman'. So no
Englishman can master the arcane intellectual skills that come so easily to
the French. He has no need of them.

<HEAD>Magazine Recounts France's Deportation of 3,500 Jewish Children</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARILYN AUGUST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nazi hunter <PERSON>Serge Klarsfeld</PERSON> on <DATE>Friday</DATE> hailed a
magazine report as the first French media account of <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>'s role
in the roundup and deportation of 3,500 Jewish children who later
died at <LOCATION>Auschwitz</LOCATION>.
   ``The episode in well-known to historians,'' <PERSON>Klarsfeld</PERSON> said in
an interview, ``but this is the first time a journalist has ever
gone to the scene of the crime to interview people who lived
there.''
   The cover story in this week's L'Express magazine, published
<DATE>Thursday</DATE>, details the role of the French police in the roundup.
   <PERSON>Klarsfeld</PERSON>, who tracked down the <ORGANIZATION>Lyon Gestapo</ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON>Klaus Barbie</PERSON>,
said he hoped the article would help speed court action against
<PERSON>Rene Bousquet</PERSON>, 80, charged with crimes against humanity.
   Bousquet was chief of the national police during the
deportations, which <PERSON>Klarsfeld</PERSON> said were conducted by the
collaborationist <PERSON>Vichy</PERSON> government to curry favor with the Nazi
occupiers.
   <PERSON>Eric Conan</PERSON>, a reporter for <ORGANIZATION>L'Express</ORGANIZATION>, visited the towns of
Pithiviers and Beaune-la-Rolande, sites of two French concentration
camps where the children spent their last days before being shipped
to the <ORGANIZATION>Nazis</ORGANIZATION>' <LOCATION>Auschwitz</LOCATION> death camp.
   ``In Pithiviers, nothing, absolutely nothing, officially
commemorates the agony experienced by the children before their
deaths,'' he wrote.
   A collective gravestone in Beaune-la-Rolande shows three small
children died at that time. The stone reads simply, ``Victims of
Hitler's barbarism.''
   ``This is false: they were under the auspices of the French
government until the moment they died,'' <PERSON>Conan</PERSON> wrote.
   The children were arrested in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> with their families <DATE>July
16-17</DATE>, <DATE>1942</DATE>, in the infamous ``Vel d'Hiv Roundup,'' named for their
destination, a large cycling stadium.
   The families were kept kept at the stadium for days without
food, water or sanitary facilities. They were transferred to
<ORGANIZATION>Pithiviers</ORGANIZATION> and Beaune-la-Rolande. The adults were sent directly on
to <LOCATION>Auschwitz</LOCATION>, but the children, including babies and toddlers,
remained for weeks in the camps, where many died of starvation and
disease.
   They were later shipped to <LOCATION>Auschwitz</LOCATION> and sent to the gas
chambers on arrival.
   <PERSON>Klarsfeld</PERSON> said French authorities ordered the deportations of
the children. The Nazis, he said, had issued orders for the roundup
of only Jews over age 16 for fear of inciting the occupied
population.
   ``They never would have taken the risk of arresting and dragging
children into the streets of <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>,'' <PERSON>Klarsfeld</PERSON> said.

THE FRENCH may not have won a battle this important in <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> since they took

A Catalan court has ruled that the French mineral water giant, <ORGANIZATION>Perrier</ORGANIZATION>, had
a rightful claim to a small fee for every litre of water sold by the only
producer of naturally carbonated water outside of <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Vichy Catalan</PERSON>.
Although <ORGANIZATION>Perrier</ORGANIZATION> will earn a mere Dollars 1,040 a year from the ruling, the
victory is an important legal foothold from which to press its attack on

of this century to break through the Catalan defences.
The story begins in <DATE>1881</DATE>, when a Catalan doctor, Modest Furest i Roca,
discovered a <DATE>spring</DATE> near <LOCATION>Gerona</LOCATION> whose waters resembled those he had once
enjoyed in <LOCATION>Vichy</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>. His enthusiasm for the bicarbonated waters
persuaded some Catalan businessmen to back his plans to bottle it.
Furest apparently registered the name <PERSON>Vichy</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> first. Today the
company is the biggest supplier of fizzy and still mineral waters in <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>.
Since <ORGANIZATION>Perrier</ORGANIZATION> took over management of <PERSON>Vichy Celestins</PERSON> more than 40 years ago
it has tried desperately to enter the Spanish market with a vichy water.
Catalan courts have handed down victory after victory to the home team.
In <DATE>1988</DATE>, however, the stalking French managed to buy about 6 per cent of
Vichy Catalan from one of the five Furest descendants, for about <ORGANIZATION>Dollars
2.5m. Since</ORGANIZATION> then it has argued in the courts that it has a right to the
canon each of the descendants gets on a litre of Vichy Catalan sold (one
fifth of a peseta per litre) and to inspect production.
Last year a lower court in <LOCATION>Barcelona</LOCATION> would not admit the acquisition. But
<ORGANIZATION>Perrier</ORGANIZATION> appealed and, though the higher court would not allow it to inspect
production, it has recognised the right to a share of the sales.
Vichy Catalan is saying nothing.

<TEXT>
   Nazi collaborator <PERSON>Jean Leguay</PERSON>, charged with
committing crimes against humanity, has died in a <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> hospital,
his lawyer said <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>. He was 79.
   Leguay died <DATE>Saturday</DATE> after a year-long battle with liver cancer,
his lawyer, <PERSON>Yves Jaffre</PERSON> said.
   Leguay was a senior police official in the <PERSON>Vichy</PERSON> government,
which collaborated with the <ORGANIZATION>Nazis</ORGANIZATION> during their World War II
occupation of <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>. He faced two charges for aiding in the
deportation of French Jews but neither came to trial.
   In <DATE>1979</DATE>, he was charged for his role in the <DATE>July 1942</DATE> roundup of
12,884 Jews _ including 4,051 children _ who were gathered in a
<LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> cycling stadium, the Velodrome d'Hiver, and deported to <ORGANIZATION>Nazi</ORGANIZATION>
death camps.
   The second set of charges, filed in <DATE>1986</DATE>, involved the
deportation of 444 Jews from <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> in <DATE>August 1942</DATE>.
   Leguay was deputy police chief in the occupied zone at the time
of the deportations.
   When he was charged in <DATE>1979</DATE>, <PERSON>Leguay</PERSON> issued a statement saying he
``never had any concern from <DATE>1940</DATE> to <DATE>1944</DATE> other than protecting the
French from their occupants.'' He was detained briefly in that year
then released pending trial.
   <PERSON>Serge Klarsfeld</PERSON>, the French lawyer who led the effort to bring
criminal charges against <PERSON>Leguay</PERSON>, described him as ``a political
police officer charged with negotiations with the Germans.''
Klarsfeld accused <PERSON>Leguay</PERSON> of persuading the Germans to include Jewish
children as well as adults in the roundups.
   Lawyer <PERSON>Jaffre</PERSON> said <PERSON>Leguay</PERSON> ``did nothing but obey the orders of
the <ORGANIZATION>Interior</ORGANIZATION> Secretary at the time.'' That the investigation
``dragged on for 10 years clearly proved there was nothing in the
dossier,'' he said.
   Under French law, there is no time limit on prosecutions for
crimes against humanity.

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT <PERSON>Francois Mitterrand</PERSON> and four senior government ministers today
begin a four-day tour of <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Jordan</PERSON>, in an attempt to rebuild
<LOCATION>France</LOCATION>'s weakened influence in the <LOCATION>Middle East</LOCATION>.
He will visit <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> for the first time since <DATE>1982</DATE>, when <PERSON>Mr Mitterrand</PERSON> was
the first serving French president to do so, thus opening a reconciliation
between the two countries. <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> has been eager to forge closer ties since
the <DATE>June</DATE> election victory of an <ORGANIZATION>Israeli Labour</ORGANIZATION> administration, committed to
progress in peace talks with the Arabs.
However, the tour comes at a sensitive moment in relations with <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION>,
because of <PERSON>Mr Mitterrand</PERSON>'s recent refusal to apologise for the wartime <PERSON>Vichy</PERSON>
regime's persecution of French Jews and his decision to send a wreath to the
tomb of Marshal <PERSON>Philippe Petain</PERSON>, the Vichy leader.
French influence in the <LOCATION>Middle East</LOCATION> has dwindled since the Gulf war, because
of its arms sales to <ORGANIZATION>Iraq</ORGANIZATION>, and the country has played only a minor role in
the Arab-Israeli peace talks.
<LOCATION>France</LOCATION> has accordingly started to play an important part in encouraging
talks on economic matters between the two sides, having hosted last month an
economic conference of Israelis and Palestinians in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>. The French
government tabled a plan to rebuild the regional rail network and plans to
promote this idea on the coming tour.
The 150-strong delegation, which includes senior industrialists, will focus
on immediate rail projects, such as for a link to the Red Sea port of <LOCATION>Eilat</LOCATION>
and the electrification of a line from <LOCATION>Haifa</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Tel Aviv</LOCATION>.
<PERSON>Mr Mitterrand</PERSON>, who last week called for an end to the 'unacceptable,
immoral' Arab boycott of <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION>, will meet Palestinian leaders tomorrow. He
will then move on to <PERSON>Jordan</PERSON>, a long-standing French ally. He is due to
discuss the progress of the peace talks with <PERSON>King Hussein</PERSON>.

FT  10 SEP 94 / Mitterrand wields double-edged sword: Ailing French
president prepares the ground for the judgment of history
</HEADLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
In recent days <PERSON>Francois Mitterrand</PERSON> has been behaving like a man clearing his
desk, putting a gloss on his presidential record for posterity, and emptying
out dusty drawers before the historical cleaners arrive to uncover more
murky incidents in his past.
One of his doctors affirmed yesterday that the president, whose 78th
birthday falls next month and who has been suffering from prostate cancer
for at least two years, was 'fine'. And indeed on <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <PERSON>Mr Mitterrand</PERSON> was
in <LOCATION>Berlin</LOCATION> to take the farewell to his country's troops there, and he was
back in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> yesterday to greet President <PERSON>Jiang Zemin</PERSON> of <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>, with whom
he will sign some big-figure trade contracts today.
But what the president has told Le Figaro newspaper in two long interviews
this week, and <PERSON>Mr Pierre Pean</PERSON>, the author of a startling book on the 1936-47
period of his youth, has left an extraordinary ambiguity around everything,
including his health. He told Le Figaro that he reckoned his cancer 'will be
obliging enough for me to finish my term' which ends next <DATE>May</DATE>, but also said
he was conscious that he would only be around 'for a few months or years'.
As <PERSON>Mr Mitterrand</PERSON>, a specialist in ambiguity, well realises, such comments
only fuel the uncertainty in the markets and the French political world
about an early election. In addition, the Socialist president has managed to
spray criticism and praise around in such a way as to help destabilise
French conservatives. This would be wholly welcome to his own party, if it
were not for the fact that revelations about his right-wing and Vichyist
associations before, during and after the second world war have shocked many
Socialists.
It was already known that the young <PERSON>Mitterrand</PERSON> participated in some
right-wing movements before the war, and that after his escape from a German
prisoner camp in <DATE>1941</DATE>, he worked for the <PERSON>Vichy</PERSON> administration for a year or
so before sliding into the resistance.
But what has shocked many French is the disclosure of <PERSON>Mr Mitterrand</PERSON>'s
friendly associations with <PERSON>Mr Jean-Paul Martin</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mr Rene Bousquet</PERSON>, senior
officials in the <LOCATION>Vichy</LOCATION> police. <PERSON>Mr Mitterrand</PERSON>, while president, apparently
attended <PERSON>Mr Martin</PERSON>'s funeral in <DATE>1986</DATE>. He also told <PERSON>Mr Pean</PERSON> that he
considered <PERSON>Mr Bousquet</PERSON> 'sympathetic'; yet as president he inaugurated a day
of national mourning for one of the Jewish deportations in <DATE>1942</DATE> of which
<PERSON>Bousquet</PERSON> was accused. The latter was assassinated last year before he could
face war crimes charges.
In the same interviews, <PERSON>Mr Mitterrand</PERSON> also delves into his more recent past.
He says, for instance, that his <DATE>1989</DATE> call for a Europe-wide confederation
was misinterpreted as a bid to keep eastern <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> out of the <LOCATION>European
Union</LOCATION>, and that his <DATE>1991</DATE> resistance to German calls to recognise ex-Yugoslav
republics' borders was not an attempt to freeze the Titoist order there.
But of more current interest are the various stones he casts in the path of
Prime Minister <PERSON>Edouard Balladur</PERSON> by revealing divisions in the conservative
government over whose <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> cabinet meetings he presides. In addition to
warning rank-and-file Gaullists of 'the certain tendency' of their
government 'to re-enter the ranks of <ORGANIZATION>Nato</ORGANIZATION>', he also notes that <PERSON>Mr Alain
Juppe</PERSON>, the foreign minister, sided with him  - and against the prime and
defence ministers - on intervention in <LOCATION>Rwanda</LOCATION>. On <LOCATION>Algeria</LOCATION>, he points out the
way that <PERSON>Mr Balladur</PERSON> sided with <PERSON>Mr Charles Pasqua</PERSON>, the interior minister,
and against <PERSON>Mr Juppe</PERSON>.
Anything resembling praise for <PERSON>Mr Juppe</PERSON> is tacit encouragement to <PERSON>Mr Jacques
Chirac</PERSON>, whose presidential bid the foreign minister backs against that of
the prime minister.
Clearly, President <PERSON>Mitterrand</PERSON> intends to go on dividing before he stops
ruling.

   The former police chief under <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>'s collaborationist
<PERSON>Vichy</PERSON> government has been charged with crimes against
humanity. <PERSON>Rene Bousquet</PERSON>, 81 years old, was notified of the
charges <DATE>March 1</DATE> and remains free, <PERSON>Charles Libman</PERSON>, a lawyer
for a group that sued <PERSON>Mr. Bousquet</PERSON>, disclosed yesterday.
   <PERSON>Mr. Bousquet</PERSON>, who headed the <PERSON>Vichy</PERSON> national police in
World War II, is accused of deporting 194 Jewish children who
died in <LOCATION>Nazi</LOCATION> concentration camps. <PERSON>Mr. Bousquet</PERSON> was condemned
in <DATE>1949</DATE> for his activities under the Nazi occupation of
<LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, but the decision was reversed. He went on to become a
successful businessman.
   Two others are charged with crimes against humanity: <PERSON>Paul
Touvier</PERSON>, 75, former chief of the <LOCATION>Lyon</LOCATION> militia, and <PERSON>Maurice
Papon</PERSON>, a former budget minister accused of sharing
responsibility in the arrest and deportation of 1,700 Jews
while serving as top administrator in <LOCATION>Bordeaux</LOCATION>.
   Should <PERSON>Mr. Bousquet</PERSON>'s case go to trial, he would be the
highest-ranking official in the <PERSON>Vichy</PERSON> regime to be tried for
crimes against humanity. The state's legal review of the case
could take at least a year.
                                                                                                       

   OLYMPIC PLATFORM FOR PICASSO?
                                                                                                       

   <LOCATION>Barcelona</LOCATION> wants to display <PERSON>Pablo Picasso</PERSON>'s anti-war
masterpiece "Guernica" when the Spanish city hosts the
Olympics next year. The black-and-white Cubist painting,
housed in a special building in <LOCATION>Madrid</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Prado</LOCATION> art museum,
was painted as a protest against the horrors of <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>'s
1936-39 civil war. It was inspired by the bombing of the
Basque town of <LOCATION>Guernica</LOCATION>.
                                                                                                       

   FIRST WOMAN TO LEAD PROVINCE
                                                                                                       

   British <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION> has appointed <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>'s first female
premier, <PERSON>Rita Johnston</PERSON>. Her predecessor, <PERSON>William Vander Zalm</PERSON>,
resigned after a government report found a conflict of
interest in his sale last year of a theme park. <PERSON>Mrs.
Johnston</PERSON>, 55 years old, was first elected to the provincial
legislature in <DATE>1983</DATE> for the <ORGANIZATION>Social Credit Party</ORGANIZATION> and has been
minister of municipal affairs and of highways.
                                                                                                       

   SOME KUWAITIS SHRUG OFF CASH
                                                                                                       

   As promised, <LOCATION>Kuwait</LOCATION>'s ruler is offering <MONEY>$1,700</MONEY> to every
Kuwaiti who stayed in the emirate during its Iraqi
occupation. But in shrugging off the 500-dinar gift, some say
they don't need it, others say it isn't enough, and a few say
Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah should offer democracy instead.
One man took the cash only to give it to foreigners living in
his neighborhood who helped Kuwaitis during the occupation.
An estimated 250,000 Kuwaitis are eligible for the emir's
offer.
                                                                                                       

   SAO TOME PRESIDENT INSTALLED
                                                                                                       

   <PERSON>Miguel Trovoada</PERSON>, a former dissident and political
prisoner, was sworn in as the first freely elected president
of <LOCATION>Sao Tome</LOCATION> and Principe. He said he wants to open the
African island state in the <LOCATION>Gulf of Guinea</LOCATION> to foreign
investment. The 54-year-old lawyer defeated the incumbent,
<PERSON>Manuel Pinto</PERSON> da <LOCATION>Costa</LOCATION>, in <DATE>March 3</DATE> elections that completed
the former Portuguese colony's transition to multiparty
democracy. The cocoa-growing islands had been a one-party
state since independence in <DATE>1975</DATE>.
                                                                                                       

   DANES TO GET A PEACE DIVIDEND

   The Danish government said it will cut defense spending by
<MONEY>400 million kroner</MONEY> (<MONEY>$62.4 million</MONEY>) over two years, citing
easing East-West tensions. But the defense chief said it is
too early for any far-reaching disarmament. The military
budget now is <MONEY>14 billion kroner</MONEY> (<MONEY>$2.19 billion</MONEY>). The plan
eliminates 1,000 jobs, one of six fighter-jet squadrons, and
five armored tank squadrons; delays tank upgrades, and
postpones ship orders.
                                                                                                       

   WAGE OFFERS ARE LOWER IN <LOCATION>JAPAN</LOCATION>
                                                                                                       

   Major Japanese manufacturers in four large industries have
made wage offers that appear acceptable to their labor
unions, people in the sectors said. The offers to steel,
electrical appliance, auto and shipbuilding workers represent
narrower wage increases than those won last year.
   <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s labor unions mount a so-called <DATE>spring</DATE> offensive
each <DATE>April</DATE> in a bid to improve annual contracts, and the rank
and file tend to follow patterns set by the largest
companies.
   Thirty-five steel companies have offered their unions
identical packages to raise pay <PERCENT>4.33%</PERCENT>, down from last year's
<PERCENT>4.7%</PERCENT> increase for the industry. In the appliance industry, 17
companies have offered identical increases of <PERCENT>5.55%</PERCENT>, off from
<PERCENT>5.93%</PERCENT> raises last year. Each of the 11 auto makers is making
its own offer to its union, but of 10 offers so far, the
average is <PERCENT>5.61%</PERCENT>, down from <PERCENT>5.99%</PERCENT> raises at all 11 companies
last year. Among shipbuilders, the offered boost is <PERCENT>5.26%</PERCENT>,
down from <PERCENT>5.45%</PERCENT> a year ago.
   Financial markets have speculated that monetary
authorities would peg any changes in monetary policy partly
on the degree of inflationary pressure inherent in this
year's wage settlements.
                                                                                                       

   POSTSCRIPTS . . .
                                                                                                       

   <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> has decided to abolish first-class carriages on the
Metro underground railway, saying the higher-priced ticket is
no longer justified because all train cars are identical. A
generation ago, seats were padded in first class and wooden
in second class. Since <DATE>1981</DATE>, first class has been open to all
during rush hours. . . . The <ORGANIZATION>Jerusalem Symphony Orchestra</ORGANIZATION> on
<DATE>Tuesday</DATE> will be conducted for the first time by an Egyptian,
<PERSON>Taha Nagui</PERSON>, conductor of the <ORGANIZATION>Cairo Symphony Orchestra</ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
MR <PERSON>JEAN-MARC Vernes</PERSON>, the French financier, yesterday announced he had
withdrawn from negotiations with <ORGANIZATION>Nestle</ORGANIZATION>, the Swiss food group, to buy part
of the Vichy mineral water business.
<ORGANIZATION>Nestle</ORGANIZATION> was last <DATE>summer</DATE> instructed by the <ORGANIZATION>European Commission</ORGANIZATION> to sell a
number of the mineral water brands, including <PERSON>Vichy</PERSON> and <PERSON>Saint Yorre</PERSON>, that it
had acquired in its bruising bid battle for <ORGANIZATION>Perrier</ORGANIZATION>, one of <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>'s
best-known water companies.
<PERSON>Mr Vernes</PERSON>, chairman of the <PERSON>Vernes</PERSON> bank and the <ORGANIZATION>SCI</ORGANIZATION> investment concern, had
been discussing the possible purchase of some of the brands under the Vichy
umbrella, together with <PERSON>Mr Raul Gardini</PERSON>, the Italian businessman who is
involved with <ORGANIZATION>SCI</ORGANIZATION>.
However <PERSON>Mr Vernes</PERSON> said in an interview with La Tribune Desfosses, the French
financial newspaper, that he had halted the negotiations.
He also indicated that he might be interested in investing in some of the
state-controlled companies which may be privatised after the <DATE>March</DATE>
legislative elections.
<ORGANIZATION>Nestle</ORGANIZATION> said yesterday it was continuing discussions with other parties over
the sale of <PERSON>Vichy</PERSON> and <PERSON>Saint Yorre</PERSON>, although it stressed the talks were still
at a preliminary stage.

   A dawn raid on a sleepy priory tucked into the old
quarter of Nice ended more than 40 years on the run for <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>'s
last known World War II criminal at large.
   The gaunt, pajama-clad old man taken away last <DATE>May</DATE> by police was
<PERSON>Paul Touvier</PERSON> _ alias <PERSON>Lacroix</PERSON>, alias <PERSON>Berthet</PERSON>, alias <PERSON>Gaillard</PERSON> _ the
former head of a pro-Nazi militia unit based in <LOCATION>Lyon</LOCATION> to hunt down
resistance fighters and Jews.
   Fifty years after war devastated <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Touvier</PERSON>'s capture has
rewakened terrible memories of <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>'s collaboration with cruel
and genocidal acts of its Nazi conquerers.
   It also spotlights the role of some Roman Catholics _ at first
in the church hierarchy and later among breakaway traditionalists _
in helping <PERSON>Touvier</PERSON> evade the law since <DATE>1944</DATE>.
   If the 74-year-old <PERSON>Touvier</PERSON> lives long enough to face trial _ he
is suffering from prostate cancer _ cartons of his private papers
that he filed and took along everywhere he went during his 44 years
underground will be made public.
   ``The <PERSON>Touvier</PERSON> case will open old wounds because it will put the
militia on trial for the first time'' since immediately after the
Liberation, Nazi hunter <PERSON>Serge Klarsfeld</PERSON> said in an interview. ``For
the majority of French people, the war is part of the Middle Ages,
so the trial will set the record straight about the militia.''
   Touvier, who worked closely with <ORGANIZATION>Lyon Gestapo</ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON>Klaus
Barbie</PERSON>, was arrested at the Liberation, but escaped from prison. He
was twice convicted of war crimes and sentenced to death in
absentia.
   Thanks to persistent lobbying on his behalf by <PERSON>Charles Duquaire</PERSON>,
private secretary to the archibishop of <LOCATION>Lyon</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Touvier</PERSON> was pardoned
quietly in <DATE>1971</DATE> by President <PERSON>Georges Pompidou</PERSON>.
   The president justified his action by asking: ``Is it not the
time to throw a veil over the times when the French didn't love
each other, and even killed each other?''
   Most Frenchman answered with a resounding ``No.'' New charges,
not covered by the pardon, were filed and <PERSON>Touvier</PERSON> went back into
hiding, slipping in and out of monasteries and religious retreats
throughout <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Switzerland</LOCATION> _ even walking village
streets dressed in monk's robes.
   Fresh charges of crimes against humanity and an international
arrest warrant were filed in <DATE>1981</DATE>. Touvier is accused of
responsibility for the execution of Jewish hostages and the murder
of <PERSON>Victor Basch</PERSON>, 81-year-old president of the <ORGANIZATION>League of Human
Rights</ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON>Basch</PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON>Helene</PERSON>.
   The current archbishop of <LOCATION>Lyon</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Albert Decourtray</PERSON>, decided to
open the local church archives to a panel of prominent lay
historians this fall to determine ``the attitude of the church, its
men and its communities in the <PERSON>Touvier</PERSON> affair.''
   ``I prefer the truth, even if it is unpleasant, to a pleasant
lie, because it is liberating,'' <PERSON>Decourtray</PERSON> said, adding it was
``probable that sanctions would be pronounced against those
clergymen who helped <PERSON>Touvier</PERSON> evade the law.''
   Klarsfeld has warned against confusing the entire church with
the smattering of right-wing Catholic traditionalists who sheltered
<PERSON>Touvier</PERSON>.
   ``We must emphasize the enormous, and sometimes unknown debt
Jews have towards the French Catholic Church,'' <PERSON>Klarsfeld</PERSON> wrote in
a commentary in the daily Le Monde.
   ``If three-quarters of <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>'s Jewish community survived, it
was because of the solidarity and sympathy of the French people and
the churches of <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>,'' he wrote.
   Touvier was arrested in a dawn raid at the <LOCATION>St. Francis</LOCATION> priory,
which Nice city officials had made available to the traditionalist
followers of rebel <PERSON>Monsignor Marcel Lefebvre</PERSON>, who was
excommunicated by the <ORGANIZATION>Vatican</ORGANIZATION> last year.
   Though most reaction to <PERSON>Touvier</PERSON>'s capture was favorable, the
leader of the extreme-right <ORGANIZATION>National Front</ORGANIZATION>, Jean-Marie Le Pen, said
he did not consider ``tracking down an old man a victory for human
rights.''
   ``During the war he belonged to the militia. So what? After 30
years, the wounds should be healed. <PERSON>Touvier</PERSON> did not endanger the
public order,'' Le Pen said.
   If <PERSON>Touvier</PERSON> does stand trial, he would be the first French
collaborator to be tried for crimes against humanity. Barbie,
brought back to <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> after a long South American exile, was
convicted of crimes against humanity in <DATE>1987</DATE> and sentenced to life
in prison.
   But prosecutions of other collaborators have dawdled, perhaps
not suprisingly in a country where elected government officials
cooperated with the Nazi occupiers and wrote and enforced
anti-Jewish laws resulting in the deportation and death of some
75,000 Jews.
   <PERSON>Maurice Papon</PERSON>, who was responsible for signing orders to deport
thousands of Jews from <LOCATION>Bordeaux</LOCATION> while he was secretary-general of
the <LOCATION>Gironde</LOCATION> prefecture between <DATE>June 1942</DATE> and <DATE>August 1944</DATE>, has been
awaiting trial since he was charged with crimes against humanity in
<DATE>1983</DATE>.
   After the war, <PERSON>Papon</PERSON> served in many high-profile government
posts, including chief of police and budget minister under
President <PERSON>Valery Giscard</PERSON> d'Estaing.
   Some historians believe evidence implicating other respected
personalities from post-war French society could be lying in dusty
archives, accessible only after long administrative paperwork.
   ``The <PERSON>Papon</PERSON> affair has had a chilling effect on archivists,''
American historian <PERSON>Robert Paxton</PERSON>, author of ``<PERSON>Vichy France</PERSON>,'' said
in a telephone interview.
   ``They may have had their knuckles rapped and they are now
treading lightly, reluctant to make public documents that might
cause problems for prominent public officials,'' <PERSON>Paxton</PERSON> said.
   French scholars, <PERSON>Paxton</PERSON> said, prefer to forge reputations
studying other subjects, ``a reaction, perhaps, to the disagreeable
reality of the Occupation.''

FT  19 MAR 94 / Deadly rattle of skeletons: Dominic Lawson ponders the ugly
question of wartime collaboration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINIC LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
We all have skeletons in our closet. In the case of the people of <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>,
there are 75,000 of them. That is the estimated number of French Jews
rounded up and sent by their Government to be murdered in <LOCATION>Nazi</LOCATION> concentration
camps. At least seven more French Jews met a different fate. They are the
people for whose execution <PERSON>Pierre Touvier</PERSON> is now on trial at <LOCATION>Versailles</LOCATION>.
'Crimes against humanity' is on the charge sheet, and the 78-year-old former
intelligence chief of the Milice, the <PERSON>Vichy</PERSON> regime's pro-Nazi paramilitary
force, is the first Frenchman to be so charged.
You might wonder, as I do, why <PERSON>Touvier</PERSON> is the only Frenchman against whom
such a charge could be levelled.
You might also wonder why <PERSON>Touvier</PERSON> has had to wait 50 years for his trial.
The answer is that he was sheltered throughout the intervening years by
various outposts of the <ORGANIZATION>Roman Catholic Church</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> - a skeleton in the
cloister, if ever there was one. But the people of <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> do not, for
understandable reasons, like to dwell on such embarrassing memories. Instead
they prefer to carry on preparing their celebrations for the 50th
anniversary of D-Day in <DATE>June</DATE>, and in particular, snub the Germans by not
inviting them to the party.
Last week the mayor of <ORGANIZATION>Caen</ORGANIZATION>, who had broken ranks by inviting <PERSON>Helmut Kohl</PERSON>,
the German chancellor, to their local celebration of the great Day, was
ordered by <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> to withdraw the invitation.
The resulting spat in the Franco-German relationship fills us in <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>
with feelings of deep satisfaction.
We have no skeletons in our closet, unless you are going to be fussy and
dredge up the fire-bombing of <LOCATION>Dresden</LOCATION>. We, thanks principally to <PERSON>Hitler</PERSON>'s
decision to open a second front against the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>, never had to face
outright German invasion. Doubtless, if we had, we would have fought them on
the beaches. I cannot imagine that a <ORGANIZATION>British Government</ORGANIZATION> would have handed
<LOCATION>London</LOCATION> over to the enemy, without a shot being fired, in the way the French
did <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>.
But if we had been overrun by the <LOCATION>Nazis</LOCATION>, would we then have been ruled by an
assiduously collaborationist regime, along Vichy lines? Would we, in other
words, have had our own Touviers? It is interesting how quickly you can
reduce a civilised <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> dinner party to shouting and walk-outs by
suggesting that this is what would have happened in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>. I remember my
maternal grandmother, a member of a prominent <PERSON>Jewish</PERSON> family - it owned the J
<PERSON>Lyons</PERSON> food catering business - intimating to me that they would have made
their own cyanide pills to take when the knock on the door came.
I do not think that this was such a lamentable lack of confidence in the
moral strength of the British people: just the same sort of practical
realism that had enabled them to build a great business from street barrows.
Discussions - or rather, ferocious arguments - about what would have
happened to British Jews, usually disintegrate into competing hypotheses.
But, there is no need for that.
Last year, under the 50-year rule, documents were released which showed how
occupied <ORGANIZATION>Guernsey</ORGANIZATION> collaborated with the Nazi invader's solution to the
Jewish problem. The papers charted British officials' collusion in
identifying three Jewesses who were subsequently deported and perished in
<LOCATION>Auschwitz</LOCATION>. Last week it was the turn of the Jersey archives to be released.
Most of the papers relating to the period of occupation had been
mysteriously stolen. But those that remained paint a depressingly familiar
pattern, with officials assisting their German governors with the
identification of the Jewish population.
One document, from a British company, reports that: 'As far as the Channel
Islands are concerned, I can definitely state that no Jew, male or female,
is employed by the company, nor had any Jew been so employed since the
<LOCATION>Jersey</LOCATION> branch was opened.'
Perhaps the company was simply trying to protect its Jewish employees. What
would you have done?

@  Film: Kindness Amid the Nazi Horror
@  ----

<DD> 09/07/89 </DD>
<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) </SO>
<TEXT>
   <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION>'s Roman Catholic Primate <PERSON>Jozef Cardinal Glemp</PERSON> isn't doing his Solidarity friends a favor by reviving the image of the Jew-baiting Pole. 
Raising the old bugaboo about Jewish control of the media while slamming Jews protesting the presence of a Carmelite convent at <LOCATION>Auschwitz</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Cardinal Glemp</ORGANIZATION> seems to have forgotten what happened to Jews there, just a short drive from <LOCATION>Krakow</LOCATION>. 

   Jews aren't about to let him forget the Nazi mass murders of their people, and that's right. 
It's their moral obligation, but they also must devote energy to memorializing the noble non-Jews who risked their lives to protect Jews. 
One of the few films to deal with the subject was "Au Revoir Les Enfants," the lovely <DATE>1988</DATE> movie by French director <PERSON>Louis Malle</PERSON> -- a Catholic -- about his memory of a rural priest who eventually was deported to a concentration camp for hiding Jewish boys in his school. 

   A great many Holocaust survivors can report isolated incidents of kindness and bravery like the one <PERSON>Mr. Malle</PERSON> recalled in fictional form. 
Far rarer was what happened at the little French village of Le Chambon-sur-Lignon, where an entire town conspired to save Jews. 
Now <PERSON>Pierre Sauvage</PERSON>, a 45-year-old Jewish film maker who was born near Le Chambon, and spent his early months there, has commemorated the place and its people in an understated yet stirring documentary called "Weapons of the Spirit." 

   <PERSON>Mr. Sauvage</PERSON>'s parents wanted so badly to forget the past they didn't raise him as a Jew. 
Yet after he discovered that his family was Jewish, at the age of 18, they did take him to visit Le Chambon. 
When he returned in <DATE>1980</DATE>, intending to make a documentary about the Allied decision not to bomb the railroad tracks leading to <LOCATION>Auschwitz</LOCATION>, he decided instead to tell about what happened in <LOCATION>Le Chambon</LOCATION>, about what he calls "the conspiracy of goodness." 

   He doesn't insult Le Chambon's down-to-earth residents with sentimental treatment though he clearly feels passionately about what they did for him. 
Most of the villagers who harbored the Jews have died; the rest are old and seem slightly bewildered by <PERSON>Mr. Sauvage</PERSON>'s intentions. 
When he asks an elderly couple why they helped, they shrug. 
"I don't know," says the white-haired woman. 
"We were used to it." 
Another villager says: "It happened so naturally we can't understand the fuss." 
Finally: "It's a normal thing to do." 

   Of course in <LOCATION>Nazi-occupied France</LOCATION> -- Le <PERSON>Chambon</PERSON> was 40 miles from the <PERSON>Vichy</PERSON> border -- saving Jews wasn't the "normal" thing to do. 
It was abnormal -- dangerous, life-threatening. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Sauvage</PERSON> provides the background that explains the overwhelming casualness with which the Chambonnais viewed their actions. 
They, too, are outsiders, Huguenot Protestants living in <LOCATION>Catholic France</LOCATION> who had themselves experienced isolation and persecution hundreds of years before. 
When the old woman said, "We were used to it," she probably was taking the long view. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Sauvage</PERSON> mixes up the imagery of Le Chambon today, a quaint provincial town, with photographs from the Nazi era. 
He fills in the historical context with words and with old news footage of <LOCATION>Vichy France</LOCATION>, including a cheerful account of an exhibit called "The Jew in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>," which explained in detail "the harmful effect of the Jew in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>." 
More than 13,000 people visited the exhibit in three days, the announcer declared. 

   The numbers may or may not have been true. 
In Le Chambon, where Jewish refugees arriving in the middle of the night were never asked what their religion was, the propaganda was irrelevant. 
Under the guidance of their pastor, <PERSON>Andre Trocme</PERSON>, these fundamendalist Christians practiced what <PERSON>Trocme</PERSON> preached. 
They loved their neighbors. 
By the war's end, the town's population included almost one Jew for every one of the 5,000 locals. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Sauvage</PERSON>, too, took his cue from Pastor <PERSON>Trocme</PERSON>, who encouraged his congregation to use "weapons of the spirit" to fight evil. 
He rousted other Jewish beneficiaries of Le Chambon's spirit to speak on film about how they were saved. 
Many of them had never acknowledged the good that had been done them, because they couldn't bear to remember the accompanying sorrow. 
In his capacity as film maker and the president of a charitable foundation called <ORGANIZATION>Friends of Le Chambon</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Sauvage</PERSON> is performing a valuable function. 
He's reminding us that while the evil shouldn't be forgotten, neither should the good. 

   ---

   Playwright <PERSON>Willy Russell</PERSON>'s "<PERSON>Shirley Valentine</PERSON>" has greatly pleased audiences in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> with the idea that all a bored, middle-aged British woman needs to resuscitate her marriage is a quick roll in the sand with a bartender on a Greek island. 
Mostly the piece gave <PERSON>Pauline Collins</PERSON>, with her droopy doll's face, a chance to work lots of charm with the play's zippy one-liners and sit-com philosophizing. 
Transferred to the screen, <PERSON>Ms. Collins</PERSON> remains charming, even playing against the odd spectacle of <PERSON>Tom Conti</PERSON>'s flabby Greek beach boy. 

   ---

   VIDEO TIP: <PERSON>Louis Malle</PERSON>, best known in this country as <PERSON>Mr. Candice Bergen</PERSON>, has made two fine and entirely different films about the Nazi occupation of <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>. 
His <DATE>1974</DATE> "Lacombe Lucien" was a chilling investigation into the banality of evil, about how a rough farm boy became a vicious Nazi collaborator simply because he couldn't get a job with the local resistance. 
More recently, with "Au Revoir Les Enfants" (which is available on videocassette), he returned to an incident in his own history, to the time he spent in the rural Jesuit school where his Parisian parents shipped him to sit out the war. 
Though the film is about the boys, the movie's hero is the school director who defied the Nazis by harboring Jewish children.

FT  04 MAR 93 / Brussels to clear Perrier takeover
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE <ORGANIZATION>European Commission</ORGANIZATION> is about to approve the takeover of <ORGANIZATION>Perrier</ORGANIZATION>, the
French mineral water company, by <ORGANIZATION>Nestle</ORGANIZATION>, the Swiss foods group, write <PERSON>Andrew
Hill</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Ian Rodger</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Zurich</LOCATION>.
Brussels' competition authorities signalled yesterday they were broadly
satisfied with the proposed sale of part of <ORGANIZATION>Perrier</ORGANIZATION>'s assets to the French
beverage company Castel for FFr750m (Pounds 94m).
A formal go-ahead will have to wait until the French government, and the
French town of Thonon-les-Bains have approved <PERSON>Castel</PERSON> as the new operator of
the <PERSON>Vichy</PERSON> and Thonon water sources under their control.
The <ORGANIZATION>Commission</ORGANIZATION> approved the Nestle-Perrier deal last <DATE>July</DATE> after a five month
inquiry, but on condition the rights to certain mineral water brands and
springs were sold to a single buyer.
The <ORGANIZATION>Commission</ORGANIZATION> wants to encourage a new 'third force' on the French mineral
water market, apart from <ORGANIZATION>Nestle</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>BSN</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>'s biggest food company.
Commission officials said yesterday they did not think the sale of Thonon
and <PERSON>Vichy</PERSON> would pose particular problems.
Under the original deal with <ORGANIZATION>Nestle</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Castel</ORGANIZATION> would have acquired the rights
to <LOCATION>Vichy</LOCATION>, Thonon and <PERSON>Saint Yorre</PERSON>, but not Pierval, the fourth brand
specified in the <ORGANIZATION>Commission</ORGANIZATION>'s decision last <DATE>summer</DATE>. However, under pressure
from <LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Nestle</ORGANIZATION> persuaded <ORGANIZATION>Castel</ORGANIZATION> to buy Pierval as well, and announced
an amended deal last week.

<ORGANIZATION>NESTLE</ORGANIZATION>, the Swiss food group, has found a buyer for most of the mineral
water assets which <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> competition authorities required it to dispose of
after it acquired <ORGANIZATION>Groupe Perrier</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> last year.
However, the proposed FFr750m (Dollars 134m) sale - to <ORGANIZATION>Societe
d'Investissement d'Aquitaine</ORGANIZATION>, holding company for the French Castel
beverages company - does not fulfil all the conditions which <LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION> has
insisted on before it approves the <ORGANIZATION>Perrier</ORGANIZATION> take-over.
The <ORGANIZATION>Commission</ORGANIZATION> requires <ORGANIZATION>Nestle</ORGANIZATION> to sell to a single buyer mineral water
springs with a total annual capacity of 3bn litres and several specified
brands, including <PERSON>Vichy</PERSON>, Thonon, Pierval and Sr Yorre. But the deal with <ORGANIZATION>SIA</ORGANIZATION>
covers capacity of less than 3bn litres and excludes the Pierval brand.
<ORGANIZATION>Nestle</ORGANIZATION> said yesterday that <ORGANIZATION>SIA</ORGANIZATION> was not interested in <LOCATION>Pierval</LOCATION>, and that it
doubted whether any other buyer could be found for it. The Swiss company was
putting the proposed sale to <LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION>, in the hope that it would nonetheless
be approved.
The <ORGANIZATION>Commission</ORGANIZATION> said that it had not yet received details of the proposed
sale from <ORGANIZATION>Nestle</ORGANIZATION>. However, a spokesman said that Nestles agreement to meet
the conditions specified last year amounted to a commitment.
Until <ORGANIZATION>Nestle</ORGANIZATION> disposes of the <ORGANIZATION>Perrier</ORGANIZATION> assets to a new owner approved by
<LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION>, the Swiss company may not complete the sale of <ORGANIZATION>Volvic</ORGANIZATION>, another
large <ORGANIZATION>Perrier</ORGANIZATION> brand, to <ORGANIZATION>BSN</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>'s largest food manufacturer.
The Swiss company is counting on the proceeds of the <ORGANIZATION>Volvic</ORGANIZATION> deal to cover
part of the FFr13.4bn it paid to acquire <ORGANIZATION>Perrier</ORGANIZATION> after a hard-fought
takeover battle in which it was supported by <PERSON>Mr Antoine Riboud</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>BSN</ORGANIZATION>
chairman.
<ORGANIZATION>Nestle</ORGANIZATION> had apparently hoped that the <ORGANIZATION>Volvic</ORGANIZATION> sale would defuse objections
from <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> competition authorities. However, <LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION> judged that <ORGANIZATION>Nestle</ORGANIZATION> and
<ORGANIZATION>BSN</ORGANIZATION> would together enjoy a duopoly of the French mineral water market and
ordered disposal of some of <ORGANIZATION>Perrier</ORGANIZATION>'s assets to reduce the Swiss company's
dominance.
The assets which <ORGANIZATION>SIA</ORGANIZATION> has agreed to buy had sales of more than FFr620m in
<DATE>1991</DATE>. The <ORGANIZATION>Castel</ORGANIZATION> group has annual revenues of FFr5.6bn.
As part of its agreement with <ORGANIZATION>SIA</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Nestle</ORGANIZATION> will buy out minority shareholders
in <ORGANIZATION>Compagnie Fermiere de Vichy</ORGANIZATION>, developer of a spa and hotel project partly
financed by income from <PERSON>Vichy</PERSON> mineral water sales.

scroll of honor, and 30 villagers have medals, a half-century after
they and their neighbors saved 5,000 Jews from Nazi persecution.
   Israeli Ambassador <PERSON>Ovadia Soafer</PERSON> presented the Medals of
Righteousness to townspeople who risked their lives as they
sheltered Jews on the run from <DATE>1940 through 1944</DATE>.
   ``You gave a lesson of courage and dignity, but also a political
lesson which statesmen of the entire world should retain and apply
as a rule of conduct - don't give in to threats, don't let youself
be intimidated,'' <PERSON>Soafer</PERSON> said at <DATE>Sunday</DATE>'s ceremony.
   The entire town, in addition to its scroll, will be honored <DATE>Oct.
22</DATE> at the Yad Vashem holocaust memorial in <LOCATION>Jerusalem</LOCATION>.
   It is the first community in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> to be recognized
collectively by the <ORGANIZATION>Yad Vashem</ORGANIZATION> institute, which customarily honors
individual non-Jews who took risks on behalf of Jews during World
War II.
   <PERSON>Marie Brottes</PERSON>, 84, said she and her neighbors, mostly poor
Protestant peasants, simply did what the <LOCATION>Bible</LOCATION> advised.
   ``You had to see those poor Jews who arrived with nothing - no
clothes, no possessions, no family. We helped them because it's
written in the Gospel. That's what gave us the courage and strength
to do what we did,'' she said in a telephone interview.
   Just 11 weeks after <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> fell to the Germans, the
collaborationist <PERSON>Vichy</PERSON> government passed laws discriminating
against Jews. By <DATE>1945</DATE>, 80,000 Jews had been deported to <ORGANIZATION>Nazi</ORGANIZATION> death
camps. Only 2,500 returned.
   Sheltering mainly children at first, the people of Le Chambon
turned no one away, betrayed no one, attempted to convert no one.
   <PERSON>Mrs. Brottes</PERSON> and other villagers recall the wartime events in
``The Weapons of the Spirit,'' a documentary film about how,
through word of mouth, the quiet, mountain community in central
<LOCATION>France</LOCATION> became a place of refuge for 5,000 Jews.
   The 90-minute film, shown in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> for the first time last
week, was screened in Le Chambon before an audience of rescuers and
survivors, many never reunited before.
   ``Le Chambon-sur-Lignon was like paradise, a little corner of
the world that allowed us to survive,'' said <PERSON>Joseph Atlas</PERSON>, 14 when
he reached Le Chambon after a brief period at an internment camp.
   Atlas, now a 64-year-old engineer, said residents might not
understand why many Jews took so long returning to the village to
express thanks.
   ``At the end of the war, when we discovered the full extent of
the Holocaust, we had to rebuild ourselves psychologically,'' he
said.
   Atlas praised the film's accuracy, but said it brought back
troubling memories.
   The film is the work of <PERSON>Pierre Sauvage</PERSON>, born in <DATE>1944</DATE> to Jews who
took refuge in Le Chambon.
   Sauvage says Le Chambon - inspired by its impassioned pastor,
<PERSON>Andre Trocme</PERSON> - was swept up in a conspiracy of goodness.
   ``Goodness was contagious. It was a situation in which it was
almost harder to do evil than good,'' said <PERSON>Sauvage</PERSON>, who is based in
<LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> and has worked for PBS in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>.
   The villagers are hardly inclined to see themselves as heroes.
   ``They simply thought what they did was normal, and they looked
at me as though my questions were stupid,'' <PERSON>Sauvage</PERSON> said.
   <PERSON>Madga Trocme</PERSON>, 89, widow of Pastor <PERSON>Trocme</PERSON>, said the villagers
acted because they knew in their hearts ``anything else would have
been a sin.''
   ``They acted in the memory of their Huguenot tradition and the
persecution they experienced over the centuries,'' she said after
seing the film. ``It was war, everybody was in danger. We did what
we did because it had to be done.''

<TEXT>     <ORGANIZATION>Vichy Springs Resort</ORGANIZATION> fell on hard times and into disrepair until <PERSON>Gilbert</PERSON>
and <PERSON>Marjorie Ashoff</PERSON> purchased and restored the property. Officially open just
two years, the "new" resort is an outdoor lover's paradise.;    Tucked into
the east foothills of <LOCATION>Ukiah</LOCATION>, only three hours north of <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION>, the resort
boasts 700 acres of wild land laced with over 10 miles of trails and dirt
roads suitable for wandering and mountain biking.;    "Mountain bikers and
hikers are encouraged to use the many game trails we have crisscrossing the
hills, as well as the fire roads on our property and the adjacent Bureau of
Land Management land," says <PERSON>Gilbert Ashoff.</PERSON>;    I took Ashoff at his word and
headed out on my bike for a ride he recommended. The first three miles or so
climbed steeply with a few sharp drops. It was a 3,000-foot, mind-bending
ascent finding me sometimes on my bike, sometimes beside it, and once under
it.;    Still, the views were spectacular, with <PERSON>Lake Mendocino</PERSON> and the <LOCATION>Ukiah</LOCATION>
valley spread out beneath my feet. This is not a ride for beginners.;    At
the top, fire roads fanned out in every direction inviting exploration into
the BLM-managed Cow Mountain Recreation Area. According to <LOCATION>Ashoff</LOCATION>, the roads
into the <ORGANIZATION>BLM</ORGANIZATION> interior are relatively smooth and rolling with minimal elevation
gain and loss. Time did not permit further wandering so I headed back.;    The
descent was fast and furious with many whoop-dee-doos, ruts and potholes. I
can't remember when I last had such fun riding a mountain bike. Unfortunately,
because I was relying on verbal directions, I zigged when I should have zagged
and ended in a swampy area with no more road.;    Faced with the choice of
climbing part way up what I had just raced down, I chose to point my wheel
downhill and plow through the underbrush until I found another road -- I
hoped.;    This is not a recommended choice and Ashoff is working on a map and
trail signs that will be available to help visitors stay on the right track.; 
  After thrashing through hundreds of yards of poison oak I popped out on the
road I should have been on in the first place. This brought me quickly to a
stream with a pretty meadow and evidence of an old cinnabar mining operation.
From here it was a short jaunt over a cow-rutted road back to the resort.;   
<ORGANIZATION>Ashoff</ORGANIZATION> says cows no longer will be allowed on the property when the roads are
wet so future riders can enjoy a smooth road.;    Slipping into a 90 degree
champagne mineral water bath under a crystal clear sky and warm sun, with
<ORGANIZATION>Grizzly Creek</ORGANIZATION> rushing by below and birds singing above, seemed almost surreal.
It was a delightful finish to the day.;    There is a nearby cabin for Swedish
massages and herbal facials, and other guests who indulged raved about the
pampering. The rate for this one to one-and-a-half hour luxury is <MONEY>$45</MONEY> to <MONEY>$65.</MONEY>;
   If it is hiking that you crave, there is plenty to be had. By following the
creek, sometimes beside it, sometimes in it, you come to a waterfall and
swimming hole. The creek is lined with poison oak so plan to get your feet wet
and wade when necessary.;    An old cinnabar mine shaft is within an hour and
a half moderate hiking that will find you wandering over rolling hills, down
to the stream and a pretty meadow, and then up the side of a heavily-treed
hill.;    Closer to the resort there are any number of possibilities for an
easy ramble or picnic.;    <ORGANIZATION>Vichy Springs Resort</ORGANIZATION> is a historical landmark. The
two cottages for overnight guests, both with kitchens, are listed as the
oldest standing structures in <LOCATION>Mendocino County</LOCATION>. There also are 12 guests rooms
with private baths located in a long, ranch-style building.;  IF YOU'RE
INTERESTED; The cottages are <MONEY>$125</MONEY> for one bedroom and <MONEY>$135</MONEY> for two bedrooms.
The guest rooms are <MONEY>$65</MONEY> for a single and <MONEY>$95</MONEY> for a double. Rates include a
continental breakfast, use of the mineral baths, pool, hot tub and grounds. A
<MONEY>$20</MONEY> day-use fee entitles you to use the grounds and the facilities if you
choose not to stay overnight.;    For reservations write or call <ORGANIZATION>Vichy Springs

FT  18 NOV 92 / French president and his party drift apart: Relations
between Mitterrand and the Socialists have sunk to a new low
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RELATIONS between <PERSON>Mr Francois Mitterrand</PERSON> and <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>'s governing Socialist
party have sunk to an all-time low in the past few weeks as the president
prepares for life after the Socialist administration.
Both sides have increasingly distanced themselves from each other on a whole
range of issues, ever since the traumatically close referendum on European
union in <DATE>September</DATE>, called by <PERSON>Mr Mitterrand</PERSON> against the advice of several
senior Socialists.
What are they up to? <PERSON>Mr Mitterrand</PERSON> is seen by the French press as trying to
bolster his personal power to make life difficult for the conservatives, who
are on course for a landslide victory in the legislative elections on <DATE>March
21</DATE> and 28.
The Socialists, meanwhile, are said to be resigned to growing apart from an
ailing and unpopular president, who might not last the course until the end
of his mandate in <DATE>spring 1995</DATE>.
While nobody in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> is as clever as <PERSON>Mr Mitterrand</PERSON> in dividing the
right-wing opposition, politicians on both sides suspect he is equally keen
on tripping up his own party. <PERSON>Mr Jacques Chirac</PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION>RPR</ORGANIZATION>
conservative party, dubbed <PERSON>Mr Mitterrand</PERSON> as 'the inventor of permanent civil
war as a method of government,' in a recent newspaper interview.
Other critics believe <PERSON>Mr Mitterrand</PERSON> wants to snub both sides of French
politics at once to reflect voters' general dissatisfaction with the
political class, a tactic reminiscent of <ORGANIZATION>General de Gaulle</ORGANIZATION>'s attempts to
strike an intimate relationship with the electorate over the head of
parliament.
The latest and most dramatic sign of the split between <PERSON>Mr Mitterrand</PERSON> and his
troops came with his recent call for a parliamentary high court inquiry into
former Socialist ministers' part in a scandal over the distribution of blood
infected with the HIV virus. If the case gets through its complex
administrative process, which it easily could, the chief defendant some time
early next year would be none other than <PERSON>Mr Laurent Fabius</PERSON>, the party first
secretary, until recently regarded as the president's chosen dauphin.
The noose tightened yesterday when the standing committee of the senate, the
upper house of parliament, approved manslaughter and fraud charges - the
first step to a trial - against <PERSON>Mr Fabius</PERSON> and two other former Socialist
ministers, <PERSON>Mrs Georgina Dufoix</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mr Edmond Herve</PERSON>.
All three deny the charges and say they look forward to this chance to clear
their names against what they say is a political campaign by the
conservative-dominated senate. They have the clear support of all senior
Socialists except for <PERSON>Mr Mitterrand</PERSON>, who has said non-committally that the
constitution must do its work.
Asked on television whether he felt betrayed, <PERSON>Mr Fabius</PERSON> said he would rather
keep his thoughts to himself. A leading Fabius supporter, <PERSON>Senator Daniel
Percheron</PERSON>, was more blunt. '<PERSON>Mitterrand</PERSON> has led us to understand that we are
alone and responsible for ourselves,' he said.
The blood scandal is only the most dramatic of a series of clashes between
the president and his party.
Other examples include Socialist MPs' recent refusal to accept <PERSON>Mr
Mitterrand</PERSON>'s plans to ban business donations to political parties, and the
president's encouragement of <ORGANIZATION>Generation Ecologie</ORGANIZATION>, led by a former
environment minister in the Socialist government, which two weeks ago turned
its back on the Socialists by forming an electoral pact with <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>'s other
main ecology party, the <ORGANIZATION>Verts</ORGANIZATION>.
<PERSON>Mr Mitterrand</PERSON>, meanwhile, enraged his party on <ORGANIZATION>Armistice Day</ORGANIZATION> by sending a
wreath to the grave of Marshal <PERSON>Philippe Petain</PERSON>, reviled by many French
people for collaborating with <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> as leader of the <PERSON>Vichy</PERSON> regime during
the second world war.
The president has discreetly done this every Armistice Day for the past
seven years without attracting a row, as a gesture likely to appeal to a
minority of older right-wing voters who remember <PERSON>Petain</PERSON> as a hero of the
first world war.
But this time the Socialist party was not prepared to turn a blind eye to
what <PERSON>Mr Henri Emmanuelli</PERSON>, speaker of the parliament, condemned as an
'incomprehensible' gesture. However, <PERSON>Mr Mitterrand</PERSON> rarely acts without a
clear motive, even if he is the only one to understand it at the time.

DREYFUS: A FAMILY AFFAIR 1789-19 45 by <ORGANIZATION>Michael Burns Chatto &amp; Windus Pounds
20</ORGANIZATION>, 572 pages
THE JEW ACCUSED: THREE ANTI-SEMITIC AFFAIRS 1894-1914 by <PERSON>Albert S. Lindemann
Cambridge</PERSON> Pounds 24.95, 311 pages
<LOCATION>FRANCE</LOCATION> IN the <DATE>19th century</DATE> seemed a promised land for its Jews. At the time
of the revolution in <DATE>1789</DATE>, the majority of French Jews had lived in <LOCATION>Alsace</LOCATION>.
Here they were barred from living in the largest cities, their occupations
were strictly limited and they were subject to special taxes.
These discriminatory laws were swept away with the old regime. In <DATE>1791</DATE> Jews
became citizens, equal with all other Frenchmen. More than this, the
progress of French commerce and industry opened opportunities for Jews
possessed with ambition and armed with cash.
Generations of the <ORGANIZATION>Dreyfus</ORGANIZATION> family had both. By the <DATE>1870</DATE>'s, the family's
position was secure enough for Alfred to forsake commerce and devote himself
to his country. He joined the army in the wake of <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>'s military
humiliation in the Franco-Prussian war. There he pursued the revolutionary
promise of a career open to talent. But if 19th-century <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> was good for
the Jews, some people wondered whether the Jews were good for <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>.
Parisian shopkeepers and small businessmen were threatened by economic
depression in the <DATE>1880</DATE>'s. Catholic control of education was attacked by
anti-clerical republicans. Anti-Semites encouraged both groups to attribute
their misfortunes to the corrupt and Jew-ridden conditions of life under the
<ORGANIZATION>Third Republic</ORGANIZATION>.
The Jewish conspiracy appeared to be confirmed in <DATE>1894</DATE>. <PERSON>Alfred Dreyfus</PERSON>, the
Jewish super-patriot, was disgraced as a traitor. His alleged crime was
selling military secrets to the German government. <ORGANIZATION>Dreyfus</ORGANIZATION>'s trial was
accompanied by a campaign of anti-Semitism. His guilt was arrived at by a
process that combined conspiracy, prejudice and blunder. But <DATE>five years
later</DATE>, thanks to the efforts of his brother <PERSON>Mathieu</PERSON> and the honesty of
isolated French officers, <PERSON>Alfred</PERSON> was set free.
The Dreyfus Affair crystallised the opposing forces in French political
life: Catholics and anti-clericals, monarchists and republicans, socialists
and the military, battled over <LOCATION>Alfred</LOCATION>'s fate. Their hopes and fears for
<LOCATION>France</LOCATION> were poured into the man.
Historians have followed contemporaries in preferring <ORGANIZATION>Dreyfus</ORGANIZATION> the symbol to
<ORGANIZATION>Dreyfus</ORGANIZATION> the man. <PERSON>Michael Burns</PERSON> redresses the balance. He has written an
account not only of <PERSON>Alfred Dreyfus</PERSON> but of his family as it rode the
vicissitudes of French history between revolution and liberation.
Half a century after <PERSON>Alfred</PERSON> was first accused, his grand-daughter <PERSON>Madeleine</PERSON>,
a worker in the French resistance, perished in <LOCATION>Auschwitz</LOCATION>. Burns wants us to
find in the <ORGANIZATION>Dreyfus</ORGANIZATION> case a training ground for the more deadly assault on
the French Republic and <ORGANIZATION>Dreyfus</ORGANIZATION>'s descendants perpetrated by the <PERSON>Vichy</PERSON>
regime. But the contrast between <ORGANIZATION>Madeleine</ORGANIZATION>'s fate and <PERSON>Alfred</PERSON>'s underlines
the differences, not the similarities, between the circumstances they
confronted and the choices they were offered.
This contrast is reinforced by <PERSON>Albert Lindemann</PERSON>'s stimulating study of The
Jew Accused. Apart from the <ORGANIZATION>Dreyfus Affair</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Lindemann</PERSON> focuses on two other
trials before the First World War in which Jews were falsely accused of
terrible crimes. In <LOCATION>Kiev</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Mendel Beilis</PERSON> was charged and acquitted of the
ritual murder of a Christian boy. In <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Leo Frank</PERSON> was lynched in the
belief that he murdered a young woman who resisted his sexual advances.
In view of his subject matter <PERSON>Lindemann</PERSON>'s optimistic conclusions are
surprising, but they are also convincing. He is at his best on the <ORGANIZATION>Dreyfus
Affair</ORGANIZATION>. For as he says, what is most significant is that <ORGANIZATION>Dreyfus</ORGANIZATION> was
released, pardoned and, finally, vindicated. The Affair culminated with the
forces of anti-Republicanism and anti-Semitism in defeat and disarray.

<HEAD>Former De Gaulle Minister Jacques Soustelle Dies at 78</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jacques Soustelle, a former Cabinet minister who
clashed with Gen. <PERSON>Charles de Gaulle</PERSON> over the Algerian conflict,
died today in the suburb of <LOCATION>Neuilly-sur-Seine</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Academie
Francaise</ORGANIZATION> announced. He was 78.
   A distinguished anthropologist noted for his study of
pre-Colombian culture, <PERSON>Soustelle</PERSON> was named to the prestigious
Academie in <DATE>1983</DATE>. The organization's terse statement announcing his
death did not give a cause of death or list survivors.
   Born in <LOCATION>Montpellier</LOCATION>, Soustelle studied letters at the <ORGANIZATION>Ecole
Normale Superieure</ORGANIZATION> and married <PERSON>Georgette Fagot</PERSON> in <DATE>1931</DATE>. They made
several scientific missions to <LOCATION>Central America</LOCATION> during the <DATE>1930s</DATE>.
   Strongly opposed to fascism, <PERSON>Soustelle</PERSON> was among the first to
rally to de Gaulle's appeal on <DATE>June 18, 1940</DATE> from <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> to fight
the <PERSON>Vichy</PERSON> government that collaborated with <LOCATION>Nazi Germany</LOCATION>.
   After the liberation of <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> in <DATE>1944</DATE>, Soustelle worked as
minister of information and later minister of colonies. He served
as governor of <LOCATION>Algeria</LOCATION> in <DATE>1955-56</DATE> during the outbreak of the war
for independence.
   De Gaulle returned to power in <DATE>1958</DATE> as the Algerian war
threatened to tear <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> apart. Soustelle again became minister of
information and later a deputy foreign minister.
   The two men had a falling out when de Gaulle made clear his
intention to grant independence to the North African country.
Soustelle resigned, saying he could not ``make a deal with
cutthroats.''
   Soustelle left <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> in <DATE>1961</DATE> and was charged <DATE>Sept. 22, 1962</DATE>
with ``attempts against the state.'' The same year, renegade army
officers tried to assassinate de Gaulle for giving <LOCATION>Algeria</LOCATION>
independence.
   Soustelle lived in exile until <DATE>1968</DATE>, when he returned to <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>
under a general amnesty and resumed his academic and political
career. The Academie made him a member <DATE>June 2, 1983</DATE> for his studies
of ancient American culture, outlined in such books as ``Life of
the Aztecs'' and ``The Maya Civilization.''
   Funeral arrangements were not announced.

  [Text] <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>, <DATE>March 16</DATE> (AFP) -- The head of <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>'s 
far-right <ORGANIZATION>National Front</ORGANIZATION> party, Jean-Marie Le Pen, on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> 
[16 <DATE>March</DATE>] criticized the trial of wartime Nazi collaborator 
<PERSON>Paul Touvier</PERSON> as "unnecessary" and his alleged crime "a detail of

  Touvier, whose trial starts <DATE>Thursday</DATE> in <LOCATION>Versailles</LOCATION>, west of 
<LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>, will be the first French national to be tried for crimes

execution of seven Jewish hostages on <DATE>June 29, 1944</DATE> when he was 
intelligence chief of the pro-Nazi French militia in the eastern 
city of <LOCATION>Lyon</LOCATION>. 
  "It strikes me as sad that 50 years after the war we still 
cannot pardon our former German adversary and that we are trying 
to find in an 80-year-old man the responsibility that might 
really belong to the <PERSON>Vichy</PERSON> regime, but especially also to the 
governments that prepared the build-up to the war and that lost 
the war," he said on French radio. (<ORGANIZATION>Touvier</ORGANIZATION> is 79). 
  "<LOCATION>France</LOCATION> has enough other problems than to dig up details of 
its past," Le Pen said. 
  Le Pen, known for his anti-Semitism, once described <PERSON>Hitler</PERSON>'s 
"final solution" -- the mass extermination of Jews -- as "a 
point of detail of history." 
  The <PERSON>Touvier</PERSON> case will throw the spotlight on wartime French 
collaboration with the Germans -- still a sensitive subject in 
<LOCATION>France</LOCATION> -- and also raise questions about the role of Roman 
Catholic clergy who sheltered and funded <PERSON>Touvier</PERSON> for some 45 
years.

<HEAD>Ex-Minister Charged with War Crimes Decries Justice System</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An ex-Cabinet minister charged nearly eight years
ago with crimes against humanity during the Nazi occupation told a
court <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> that his reputation had been tarnished by the
slow-moving judicial process.
   <PERSON>Maurice Papon</PERSON>, 80, spoke at the opening of a defamation
proceeding he initiated against a news magazine, saying it was his
only way to seek justice.
   He was charged in <DATE>January 1983</DATE> with crimes he allegedly
committed between 1942-44 as a senior police official in the
<LOCATION>Bordeaux</LOCATION> region. The alleged offenses include the deportation of
1,960 Jews to death camps.
   The <DATE>1983</DATE> charges against <PERSON>Papon</PERSON> are still pending. He has not
been brought to trial, in part because some potential evidence was
thrown out on a technicality in <DATE>1987</DATE>.
   Papon has accused the leftist Le <PERSON>Nouvel Observateur</PERSON> and two
reporters of defamation and improperly divulging court documents in
an article published in <DATE>June</DATE> that referred to him as a ``French
accomplice of genocide.''
   ``It is intolerable that a state of law lets things drag on in
this way,'' he said in a 25-minute statement opening the trial.
``Enough is enough.''
   Papon, budget minister under former President <PERSON>Valery Giscard</PERSON>
d'Estaing, wants <MONEY>$200,000</MONEY> in damages.
   <PERSON>Papon</PERSON>'s decision to take the legal initiative coincides with
assertions by lawyers and human rights activists that his case and
two others have been stalled or dragged out because of reluctance
in ``the highest levels of government'' to expose French complicity
in the <LOCATION>Holocaust</LOCATION> during World War II.
   <PERSON>Yves Jouffa</PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION>French League of Human Rights</ORGANIZATION>,
called the three men members of an ``establishment ... that does
not want to see its dirty laundry washed in public.''
   The others are <PERSON>Rene Bousquet</PERSON>, 81, who headed the national police
of the collaborationist <PERSON>Vichy</PERSON> government and later was <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> police
chief, and <PERSON>Paul Touvier</PERSON>, 75, a militia leader who worked closely
with <ORGANIZATION>Gestapo</ORGANIZATION> chief <ORGANIZATION>Klaus Barbie</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Lyon</LOCATION>. He was arrested in <DATE>May
1989</DATE> at a priory in Nice.
   After the war, <PERSON>Papon</PERSON> had a successful career as a high-ranking
civil servant. In <DATE>1981</DATE> the satirical weekly Le <ORGANIZATION>Canard Enchaine</ORGANIZATION>
disclosed his wartime activities. Legal proceedings began, and he
left public life.
   ``You can transplant onto me that I was the symbol of an
administration, a regime, a judicial system ... (that) make all of
<LOCATION>France</LOCATION> the co-author of a genocide,'' <PERSON>Papon</PERSON> told the court, saying
he was the object of a judicial machination.
   ``My dossier must remain open to put into the heads of all
Frenchmen that they all were collaborators, all accomplices to
genocide.''
   <PERSON>Claude Perdriel</PERSON>, director of Le <PERSON>Nouvel Observateur</PERSON>, said his
magazine was not trying to judge <PERSON>Papon</PERSON>, ``but we have a duty not to
make a practice of forgetfulness.''
   Journalists <PERSON>Serge Raffy</PERSON> and <PERSON>Marie-France Etchegoin</PERSON> described
their research as ``long and prudent.''
   The trial was to last two days.

<HEAD>French Court Rules Author Plagiarized `Gone with the Wind'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Novelist <PERSON>Regine Deforges</PERSON> plagiarized the classic
``Gone with the Wind'' for her best-seller ``The Blue Bicycle,'' a
court ruled <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, ordering her and her publisher to pay
<PERSON>Margaret Mitchell</PERSON>'s heirs <MONEY>$333,000</MONEY> in damages and interest.
   The <ORGANIZATION>American Trust Co</ORGANIZATION>. Bank, which holds the world rights to
``Gone with the Wind,'' had sought <MONEY>$833,000</MONEY> from <PERSON>Ms. Deforges</PERSON> and
her publisher, Editions <PERSON>Ramsay</PERSON>.
   Ramsay President <PERSON>Franck Spengler</PERSON> said the company and <PERSON>Ms.
Deforges</PERSON> would appeal. The novelist was in <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION> and
unavailable for comment, he said.
   ``We feel we're innocent,'' <PERSON>Spengler</PERSON> said in an interview.
   ``The books are both great novels but they are very different,
and so are their heroines. By nature, <PERSON>Lea</PERSON> is an optimist, and
<PERSON>Scarlett</PERSON> is more Anglo-Saxon, hard-driving, determined and
power-hungry.
   ``Let's put it this way: `The Blue Bicycle' is a historical
novel smattered with psychology and emotion while `Gone With the
Wind' is a pyschological novel cloaked with history,'' he said.
   In a judgment issued by <PERSON>Judge Nicole Antoine</PERSON>, the court
concluded ``The Blue Bicycle'' constituted an ``illicit
reproduction'' of ``Gone with the Wind.''
   ``Based on a comparative study of the two works, it is clear
that what <PERSON>Regine Deforges</PERSON> borrowed from <PERSON>Margaret Mitchell</PERSON>'s work
and incorporated into `The Blue Bicycle' is perfectly identifiable
and relates to the most important elements of <PERSON>Ms. Mitchell</PERSON>'s
novel,'' the statement said.
   The court said <PERSON>Ms. Deforges</PERSON> copied the ``general intrigue, plot
development and narrative progression, the physical and
psychological characteristics of the major figures, the
relationships between the characters, several secondary characters,
a large number of characteristic situations, the composition and
expression of numerous scenes and key dramatic moments'' of ``Gone
with the Wind.''
   There are similarities. ``The Blue Bicycle,'' which has sold
millions of copies since it was published in <DATE>1983</DATE> as the first part
of a trilogy, is set during the Nazi occupation of <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>.
   Its heroine, <PERSON>Lea Delmas</PERSON>, is the beautiful, headstrong daughter
of a southern vintner. Like <PERSON>Scarlett O'Hara</PERSON>, her carefree youth is
interrupted by the horrors of war.
   The opening scenes of garden parties, pretty dresses and
breathless suitors are reminiscent of the <ORGANIZATION>American South</ORGANIZATION>. And
<LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, like the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> in the Civil War, is divided.
Pro-Vichy Petainists condemn <PERSON>Charles de Gaulle</PERSON>'s freedom fighters.
Collaborators and militia men hunt down Jews and resistance.
   Lea sides with the underground, roaming the Bordelais
countryside on her blue bicycle carrying secret messages.
   Like <PERSON>Scarlett</PERSON>, <PERSON>Lea</PERSON> wants the one man she cannot have. Laurent
d'Argilat has married the sweet, fragile and morally upright
<PERSON>Camille</PERSON>, who bears an uncanny resemblance to <PERSON>Melanie</PERSON>.
   Deforges' French-style <PERSON>Rhett Butler</PERSON> _ <PERSON>Francois Tavernier</PERSON> _ is a
swarthy, cigar-smoking rogue who miraculously turns up whenever Lea
needs him.
   The case has been long and complicated because there are few
precedents. French law forbids plagiarism, but it does allow
pastiche, a centuries-old literary form defined as a ``humorous''
take-off or remake of a recognizable original text.
   <PERSON>Ms. Mitchell</PERSON>'s heirs saw nothing funny about ``The Blue
Bicycle,'' despite <PERSON>Ms. Deforges</PERSON> repeated assertions that her novel
was meant as a pastiche.
   ``I know what plagiarism is and it's a very bad thing,'' <PERSON>Ms.
Degorges</PERSON> said when the case went to court two years ago. ``From the
beginning `The Blue Bicycle' was intended to be a pastiche. I never
said it was supposed to be anything else.''
   The court rejected her argument, saying the differences between
the two works were ``undeniably secondary and inoperative given the
extent of their similarities.''

<TEXT>
   President <PERSON>Francois Mitterrand</PERSON> has distanced himself
from the modern French Socialist Party he founded and projected a
new centrist image in his effort to defeat conservative Premier
<PERSON>Jacques Chirac</PERSON> in the <DATE>May 8</DATE> runoff.
   Mitterrand is very much an insider in French politics despite
his leftist label. The bald, avuncular incumbent is a veteran of
four presidential elections, has held many Cabinet posts and enjoys
one of the highest status symbols in French society as a former
fighter in the World War II resistance.
   Mitterrand, 71, was first elected <DATE>May 10, 1981</DATE>, in a Socialist
tidal wave that ousted center-right President <PERSON>Valery Giscard</PERSON>
d'Estaing. A month later, the same tide pushed out conservatives
and centrists who had held power in the <ORGANIZATION>National Assembly</ORGANIZATION> for 23
years.
   Mitterrand also has known presidential defeat. He was beaten by
Gen. <PERSON>Charles de Gaulle</PERSON> in <DATE>1965</DATE> and by <ORGANIZATION>Giscard</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1974</DATE>.
   But from <DATE>1981</DATE> to <DATE>1986</DATE>, <PERSON>Mitterrand</PERSON> and his Socialists wielded
political control in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>.
   That ended in the <DATE>March 1986</DATE> legislative elections, when voters
returned rightists to power in the <ORGANIZATION>National Assembly</ORGANIZATION>, creating for
two years what the French call ``cohabitation.''
   The Socialists' early free-spending policies were abruptly
reversed and stiff austerity measures instituted. High unemployment
also dragged down the president's popularity to as low as <PERCENT>27
percent</PERCENT> at midterm.
   With the Socialist legislative defeat in <DATE>1986</DATE>, <PERSON>Mitterrand</PERSON> began
to take on a new face.
   He slipped into the role of elder statesman, developing an image
as the wise grandfather above the day-to-day battles of governing.
He distanced himself from his party, abandoned revolutionary
rhetoric, and began to reach out to the political center.
   His popularity soared again, consistently reaching an approval
rate of <PERCENT>55 percent</PERCENT> or more.
   Mitterrand was born <DATE>Oct. 26, 1916</DATE>, in <LOCATION>Jarnac</LOCATION> in western <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>.
He earned degrees in law and letters in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>. He was drafted in
<DATE>1938</DATE> and shot and captured during the German invasion of <DATE>May 1940</DATE>.
   Escaping from a prisoner-of-war camp in <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>, he returned to
<LOCATION>France</LOCATION>. The Germans were occupying the <PERSON>Vichy</PERSON> zone of <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, and
<PERSON>Mitterrand</PERSON> helped create a resistance network.
   His career-long feud with de Gaulle began during the war when
<PERSON>Mitterrand</PERSON> refused to merge his resistance group with de <ORGANIZATION>Gaulle's</ORGANIZATION>.
   It was also during his resistance days that he met <PERSON>Danielle
Gouze</PERSON>, whom he married in <DATE>1944</DATE> shortly after the liberation.
   During the chaotic post-war <ORGANIZATION>Fourth Republic</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Mitterrand</PERSON> held 11
Cabinet posts, including interior and justice minister.
   In the early <DATE>1970s</DATE>, <PERSON>Mitterrand</PERSON> took the moribund Socialist Party
and built it into a major force. But the Union of the Left he
forged with the Communists fell apart in <DATE>1977</DATE>.
   It was not until the final days of the <DATE>1981</DATE> presidential
election that the two major leftist parties again joined to defeat
<ORGANIZATION>Giscard</ORGANIZATION> and oust the conservatives.
   Mitterrand shocked much of the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION> when he brought Communists
into his government. But that new union lasted only until <DATE>1984</DATE> when
the Communists pulled out in a dispute over economic policy.

<TEXT>
   Socialist President <PERSON>Francois Mitterrand</PERSON> has been a
prominent face on the French left since the end of World War II,
but in recent years he has moved markedly to the political center.
   His first two years in office, 1981-83, involved implementation
of long-held Socialist ideas and were largely a failure. The
radical philosophy of ``rupture with capitalism'' foundered on the
rocks of economic reality.
   After trying to spend their way to prosperity, the Socialists
succeeded only in running up the national debt without being able
to stop runaway unemployment. In the face of a growing crisis, the
government was forced to reverse course and institute austerity.
   When the right ousted the Socialists from control of the
<ORGANIZATION>National Assembly</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>March 1986</DATE>, <PERSON>Mitterrand</PERSON> needed to appeal to a
wider electorate if he was to have any hope of re-election.
   Ironically, after <PERSON>Mitterrand</PERSON>'s popularity had fallen to historic
lows at mid-term, it soared after the right regained control of
<ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION>, leaving him with little real power in domestic affairs.
   The French seemed to like the balance of power. Mitterrand, 71,
quickly assumed the role of the wise grandfather, referred to
affectionately by many as ``Tonton,'' a child's term for ``uncle.''
   Mitterrand was first elected <DATE>May 10, 1981</DATE>, in a Socialist tidal
wave that ousted center-right President <PERSON>Valery Giscard</PERSON> d'Estaing
and then, a month later, the conservatives and centrists who had
held power in the <ORGANIZATION>National Assembly</ORGANIZATION> for 23 years.
   The founder of the modern <ORGANIZATION>French Socialist Party</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Mitterrand</PERSON> has
now made four presidential races. He was defeated by <ORGANIZATION>Charles de
Gaulle</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1965</DATE> and by <ORGANIZATION>Giscard</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1974</DATE>.
   Mitterrand was born <DATE>Oct. 26, 1916</DATE> in <LOCATION>Jarnac</LOCATION> in western <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>.
He earned degrees in law and letters in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>. He was drafted in
<DATE>1938</DATE>, and during the German invasion of <DATE>May 1940</DATE> was shot and
captured.
   He escaped from a POW camp in <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> and returned to <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>.
After the occupation of the <PERSON>Vichy</PERSON> zone by the Germans, he created a
Resistance network. His career-long feud with Gen. <PERSON>Charles de
Gaulle</PERSON> began during the war when <PERSON>Mitterrand</PERSON> refused to join his

<HEAD>Magazine Tracks Down Paintings Stolen By Nazis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARILYN AUGUST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Twenty-eight French masterpieces seized by the
<LOCATION>Nazis</LOCATION> during World War II, including paintings by <ORGANIZATION>Monet</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Renoir</ORGANIZATION> and
<PERSON>Gauguin</PERSON>, have been found in a cupboard at a <LOCATION>Berlin</LOCATION> museum, a news
magazine reported <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   This week's cover story in L'Express described how the works -
seized from private citizens between 1942-1944 - have been locked
away since <DATE>1972</DATE>, their existence known to only a handful of people.
   According to the magazine, the <ORGANIZATION>Department of French National
Museums</ORGANIZATION> learned the works existed in <DATE>1975</DATE>, but ``was not interested
because the works did not come from national collections.''
   ``Never did the prestigious department think of consulting its
experts or glancing through the catalogues of the artists in
question,'' l'Express wrote.
   The paintings included <PERSON>Claude Monet</PERSON>'s ``Route, Effet d'Hiver.
Soleil Couchant (Road, Effect. Sunset);'' <PERSON>Eugene Delacroix</PERSON>'s
``Jeune Homme (Young Man);'' <PERSON>Auguste Renoir</PERSON>'s ``Coco Ecrivant (Coco
Writing);'' and <PERSON>Paul Gauguin</PERSON>'s ``La Falaise (The Cliff).'' They
were examined by l'Express reporters who said they were in
excellent condition.
   <PERSON>Sylvie Poujade</PERSON>, a French museum spokeswoman, told <ORGANIZATION>The Associated
Press</ORGANIZATION> her department learned of the paintings' existence a month
ago, when contacted by l'Express reporters.
   ``We searched our archives and did not find proof that the
department had ever received a list of works from <LOCATION>Berlin</LOCATION>,'' <PERSON>Ms.
Poujade</PERSON> said.
   <PERSON>Ms. Poujade</PERSON> said that French museums are considered
``depositories of state property which they are expected to
conseve and display in good condition.''
   ``Our role is not to track down or recuperate art works not
considered state property. That's the job of other government
offices,'' she said.
   The magazine quoted <PERSON>Lothar Brauner</PERSON>, curator at the
<ORGANIZATION>Nationalgalerie</ORGANIZATION>, in formerly <LOCATION>East Berlin</LOCATION>, as saying he received the
works on <DATE>May 19, 1972</DATE> from an unidentified person claiming to have
gotten them from a third party.
   A legal document drawn up that day shows that the person wished
to hand over the paintings ``so that they would be properly
preserved until being returned to their rightful owners.''
   <PERSON>Brauner</PERSON> said he did not know who the rightful owners were.
   According to <ORGANIZATION>l'Express</ORGANIZATION>, French museum authorities were informed
the works were in <LOCATION>Berlin</LOCATION> by the <ORGANIZATION>French Foreign Affairs Ministry</ORGANIZATION>,
itself contacted by East German authorities.
   L'Express recounted how <PERSON>Brauner</PERSON> and his wife, a restoration
expert, locked the paintings in a yellow, wooden armoire and
equipped it with a pail of water and a hydrometer to measure the
humidity. From time to time, they would take out the paintings and
check their condition, the magazine wrote.
   During the war, the <ORGANIZATION>Nazis</ORGANIZATION> sought to amass as much art as
possible to fulfill <PERSON>Hitler</PERSON>'s dream of creating a European arts
center in his native <LOCATION>Linz</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Austria</LOCATION>. Several of his aides, including
<PERSON>Martin Bormann</PERSON> and <PERSON>Hermann Goring</PERSON>, were also art collectors and
rerouted much of the booty into their own hands.
   In <DATE>July 1944</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>Nazi Party</ORGANIZATION>'s art unit drew up an inventory of
21,903 art works confiscated since <DATE>1940</DATE>.
   However, the list did not include the thousands of paintings by
<ORGANIZATION>Matisse</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Chagall</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Picasso</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Leger</PERSON> and others considered
``degenerate'' or ``too Jewish'' and which were either sold to
unscrupulous French and Swiss art dealers or destroyed.
   L'Express wrote the Jeu de Paume museum in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>, once the
temple of Impressionist art, was used to stockpile seized art
works.
   On <DATE>May 27, 1943</DATE>, its interior courtyard was the scene of a giant
bonfire in which some 500 paintings by <PERSON>Andre Masson</PERSON>, <PERSON>Joan Miro</PERSON>,
<PERSON>Paul Klee</PERSON>, <PERSON>Max Ernst</PERSON> and others went up in smoke as <ORGANIZATION>Nazi</ORGANIZATION> chief
<PERSON>Alfred Rosenberg</PERSON> and armed guards looked on.
   The magazine also described how the <ORGANIZATION>Gestapo</ORGANIZATION> got its hands on
<MONEY>millions of dollars</MONEY> worth of art works following tips from French
police.
   Based on months of investigative reporting, the magazine accused
the collaborationist <PERSON>Vichy</PERSON> government of expecting to profit
financially from selling the property confiscated from French Jews,
who were later deported to concentration camps.

A CHASE THRILLER RUNNING ON ALL CYLINDERS; 
</P>
<P>
DADDY BY LOUP DURAND (VILLARD BOOKS: $18.95; 377 PP.)

"To write a thriller," the late <PERSON>John Braine</PERSON> once proposed, "you begin with 
improbability. . . . The hero must always be in danger. He must at least once 
be helpless in the hands of the enemy, and he must escape." 
</P>
<P>
Loup Durand follows this formula slavishly. "Daddy," a major best seller in 
<LOCATION>France</LOCATION> and throughout <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, not only begins with improbability but remains 
consistently improbable, even absurd, throughout. In doing so, it makes one 
consider the entire question of genre writing. For one would expect that any 
book so formulaic would lie there lifeless, inert, at best a book you keep 
reading for its plot while you berate yourself for surrendering to such obvious 
claptrap. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, this book is alive and vibrant, compelling in its suspense, rich in 
character and incident. Set in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> during World War II, the story is put 
into motion when an elderly banker, who has funneled hundreds of <MONEY>millions of 
dollars</MONEY> out of <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> for Jews and others, is caught and tortured by the 
<ORGANIZATION>Nazis</ORGANIZATION>. He leaps from a window to his death before he discloses the immensely 
complex series of secret access codes, which alone would allow the Nazis to 
reach those funds. Only his granddaughter, <LOCATION>Maria</LOCATION>, knows the codes, and she has 
taught them to her only son, the genius <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON>, who holds them all in his head. 
</P>
<P>
The Nazis want that information and set up a fiendishly effective team to track 
it down. Essentially, the book is a manhunt, although the "men" being hunted 
are, first the lovely Maria who has lived a remarkably independent life and who 
is loved and protected by many people, most notably a team of preternaturally 
capable Spanish bodyguards; and later her son, <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON>, an 11-year-old boy of 
inhuman intelligence and perspicacity and yet -- in perhaps the major victory 
for <ORGANIZATION>Durand</ORGANIZATION>'s writing skill -- immensely likable. If we did not care for this 
boy <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON>, if we did not ache for him when he watches his mother die in 
flames, if we did not feel his unwillingness to attach himself to others when 
he has seen so many who've been kind to him killed, if we did not feel his 
darknesses and his hatreds and his fears, there would be no book. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, we have to suspend disbelief here. This boy with his "rat's 
instinct," his "frightening abnormal lucidity," has the ability to outthink, 
outplan, outfox, an immensely resourceful adversary, the epicene Nazi genius 
<PERSON>Laemmle</PERSON> whose obsession with the boy becomes pathological. They play chess 
against each other, real chess when <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON> is <LOCATION>Laemmle</LOCATION>'s captive, figurative 
chess across the map of <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> when he is on the run. Chess becomes a leitmotiv 
throughout the story. 
</P>
<P>
Much the weakest element in the book is the man who turns out to be <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON>' 
real father, a playboy Rockefeller-type from <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>, who has never known of 
Thomas' existence. <PERSON>David Quartermain</PERSON> is totally apolitical, a man of no 
commitments, completely uninterested in the family international banking 
business (which turns out to have continuing important connections with Nazi 
<LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> throughout the war). Ultimately, <PERSON>David</PERSON> responds to <LOCATION>Maria</LOCATION>'s summoning 
him to <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> and becomes <PERSON>Dick Daring</PERSON>, performing astonishing feats of bravery, 
skill and planning. It's as difficult to believe most of this as it is to 
accept that a man of obvious intelligence and wealth in <DATE>1942</DATE> would not know why 
<LOCATION>France</LOCATION> was bisected into occupied and Vichy-controlled sectors, or what a 
"Petainist" was. Quartermain seems almost a Frenchman's view of the noble 
savage, ignorant but instinctively in touch with the good and the true. 
</P>
<P>
The great success of "Daddy" is in <LOCATION>Durand</LOCATION>'s teeming imagination. An abundance 
of plot, of imagination, of incident, lends a richness to the book's texture -- 
no minimalism here -- yet never buries the main narrative thrust -- the chase. 
Along the road of life, we meet dozens of characters who are individually 
delineated -- Nazis brutal and cynical, brilliant and dense, French chevaliers 
and graspers, ordinary people fearful or singularly brave, (although there 
certainly seem to be more Resistance heroes per hectare than history, as <PERSON>Marcel 
Ophuls</PERSON> has pitilessly revealed it, really produced). This is not genre fiction 
as high art, in the Le Carre mode, but it is commercial fiction of great skill 
and energy. 
</P>
<P>
A word about the translation from the French by <PERSON>J. Maxwell Brownjohn</PERSON>: It is 
seamless and idiomatic, without a single clumsy construction. It's a remarkable 
achievement to sustain a breakneck narrative pace and never once sound as if 
the book was written in anything other than English.

<HEAD>Western Europe's ``Night Of Barbarism'' Began May 10, 1940</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL VERSCHUUR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Western <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> waited for the
Germans in <DATE>spring 1940</DATE>, but <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> felt safe behind the <ORGANIZATION>Maginot
Line</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Holland</LOCATION> hoped to stay neutral. The Dutch army drafted
<PERSON>Cornelius Stam</PERSON> and gave him an <DATE>1895</DATE> rifle.
   ``We didn't do a damn thing, really,'' <PERSON>Stam</PERSON> recalled last month.
``We were just sitting in the sun'' when <PERSON>Adolf Hitler</PERSON>'s death
machine rolled west on <DATE>May 10, 1940</DATE>, casting <LOCATION>Western Europe</LOCATION> into
what <PERSON>Winston Churchill</PERSON> called a ``long night of barbarism.''
   The onslaught by bombers, tanks and <MONEY>2 million</MONEY> Wehrmacht and SS
soldiers caught the victims unprepared.
   Nazi <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> needed only four days to conquer the <LOCATION>Netherlands</LOCATION>,
which had been neutral in World War I. Hitler's legions swept the
patchwork defenses aside and destroyed the Dutch fighting spirit
with carpet bombing of <LOCATION>Rotterdam</LOCATION>.
   Two decades of peace in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> had ended nearly eight months
earlier with the German invasion of <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION>. <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>
declared war on <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> as a result, but there had been little
combat in the west.
   When the Germans invaded, officers ``had us march around at 4 in
the <TIME>morning</TIME>, toting our rifles on our shoulders, out of sheer
madness,'' <PERSON>Stam</PERSON> said in an interview.
   At dawn <DATE>May 10</DATE>, German bombers destroyed major military
airfields in <LOCATION>Holland</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Hitler</PERSON>'s troops poured across the border.
Tanks directed by Field <PERSON>Marshall Gerd von Rundstedt</PERSON> began a sweep
through <LOCATION>Belgium</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Luxembourg</LOCATION> and northern <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> to the <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION>,
meeting little resistance.
   <LOCATION>Belgium</LOCATION> surrendered <DATE>May 28</DATE> after 6,552 civilians and 6,236
soldiers had been killed. <LOCATION>Luxembourg</LOCATION>'s government fled to <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> on
the invasion's first day.
   Unlike Wilhelmina, the Dutch queen, <PERSON>King Leopold III</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Belgium</LOCATION>
decided to remain in his country under German occupation. Leopold
ultimately became so deeply compromised that he was forced to
abdicate in <DATE>1950</DATE>.
   Soon after <LOCATION>Belgium</LOCATION> capitulated, German troops turned south
toward <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>.
   About 70,000 French soldiers were killed in the futile,
six-week-long attempt to halt the German advance, more than all the
Americans killed in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>.
   France relied on the Maginot Line along the German border, a
static defense system based on the tactics of World War I. The
tanks of German panzer divisions swept around the northern end into
<LOCATION>France</LOCATION> by cutting through the Ardennes forest.
   The Dutch depended on the Water Line, last used successfully in
the <DATE>16th century</DATE> war for independence from <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>, which involved a
ring of flooded land around <LOCATION>Amsterdam</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Rotterdam</LOCATION> and The Hague. The
Germans sent waves of paratroopers, against whom flood was no
defense.
   ``It was a very fine morning,'' said <PERSON>Arie Dekker</PERSON>, who was a
15-year-old office boy near <LOCATION>Rotterdam</LOCATION> when the paratroopers came.
``The pilots were waving at us. ... They'd been told they were
protecting us from the British.''
   Queen <PERSON>Wilhelmina</PERSON> and her government fled to <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> on <DATE>May 13</DATE>.
The next day, when organized resistance was all but crushed, the
<ORGANIZATION>Luftwaffe</ORGANIZATION> returned to <LOCATION>Rotterdam</LOCATION> for a pre-announced bombing raid
that leveled its central district and killed about 800 people.
   ``The sun totally vanished,'' said <PERSON>Dekker</PERSON>'s wife, <LOCATION>Cornelia</LOCATION>,
whose family lived in Krimpen aan de <ORGANIZATION>Lek</ORGANIZATION>, a nearby town. ``At
first, we thought it was a thunderstorm.''
   In four days, the German offensive had killed 2,600 Dutch
civilians and 2,000 soldiers. It began a five-year occupation
horror of starvation, slave labor and deportations to death camps.
   As <ORGANIZATION>Holland</ORGANIZATION> fell, von <PERSON>Rundstedt</PERSON>'s tanks linked up with another
German army group from the north to encircle British and French
troops near the port of <LOCATION>Dunkirk</LOCATION> in northern <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>.
   Despite concentrated German air and artillery attacks, 340,000
Allied soldiers escaped to <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> over a 10-day period, most of
them in small boats commandeered for the rescue.
   Brig. Gen. <PERSON>Charles de Gaulle</PERSON>, who later commanded the Free
French forces from <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>, led one of the few French
counteroffensives, near <LOCATION>Abbeville</LOCATION> in the northwest. The Germans
bombed <LOCATION>Abbeville</LOCATION> to rubble <DATE>May 20</DATE>.
   ``There was nothing left after the bombing,'' said <PERSON>Louis
Werheim</PERSON>, who was 6 at the time.
   Werheim and his family fled before the raid. When they returned,
he said, ``There were bodies of French soldiers in our courtyard.
They'd been shot by the Germans.''
   On <DATE>June 22</DATE>, <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> agreed to an armistice. Two-thirds of its
territory was occupied and a collaborationist government under
Marshal <PERSON>Henri-Philippe Petain</PERSON>, the World War I hero, ran the
unoccupied southeastern sector.
   About 1.5 million French soldiers were taken prisoner and held
until the end of the war.
   Civilian hardship followed military surrender.
   Men were shipped from the occupied countries to work as slave
labor in the German war industry. The <LOCATION>Netherlands</LOCATION>, then primarily
an agricultural economy, was gradually stripped of food to feed the
conquerors.
   Starvation spread through the country. The ``hunger winter'' of
<DATE>1944</DATE> is one of the Dutch people's strongest collective memories.
   Nazi officials used the Dutch penchant for keeping meticulous
records to track down the country's 150,000 Jews, and shipped them
to death camps. Only 6,000 survived.
   The most famous war victim in the the <LOCATION>Netherlands</LOCATION> was <PERSON>Anne
Frank</PERSON>, a Jewish teenager born in <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> whose diary, written in
hiding with her family, is perhaps the most poignant memorial to
the death camps.
   Most of the Jews in <LOCATION>Belgium</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Luxembourg</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> also died in
the camps.
   Anti-Nazi underground movements were organized in the occupied
countries.
   After the Dutch surrender, <PERSON>Stam</PERSON> used his position with the
<ORGANIZATION>Nazi-run Amsterdam Labor Bureau</ORGANIZATION> to obtain ration cards for Jews and
resistance fighters in hiding, and to hamper deportation of workers
for slave labor.
   Dekker, the office boy, was 18 when the Germans sent him to
<LOCATION>Hamburg</LOCATION> to work in a shipyard. He spent three years there and
returned after the war with a busload of Dutch Jews who survived
the <LOCATION>Neuengamme</LOCATION> concentration camp near <LOCATION>Hamburg</LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Le Pen Hometown Says No To Right-Wing Gathering</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   TRINITE-SUR-MER, <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> (AP) _ The hometown of extreme
right-wing leader Jean-Marie Le Pen refused <DATE>Monday</DATE> to let him bring
in a gathering of like-minded politicians from around <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>.
   A majority of Trinite-Sur-Mer's 15 municipal legislators voted
to reject the request by the town's most famous son to allow a
meeting of extreme-right European leaders next month.
   His birthplace, a coastal resort of 56,000 people on the
<LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> coast, joined <PERSON>Vichy</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Aurillac</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Angouleme</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Lorient</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Poitiers</LOCATION> in turning away the chief of the anti-immigrant <ORGANIZATION>National
Front</ORGANIZATION> party.
   Councilors cited public objections to renting a public hall to
Le Pen, who frequently makes anti-Semitic remarks, following a
series of desecrations at Jewish cemeteries around <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>.
   The council also objected to the likely presence of <PERSON>Franz
Schoenhuber</PERSON>, a former Waffen SS soldier who heads <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION>'s
far-right Republican Party.
   ``We have had enough of seeing our town associated with the
image of Le Pen,'' three assistant mayors declared in a joint
statement last week. ``We prefer the image of the sailing capital
of Brittany.''
   About 400 citizens signed a petition asking the council to turn
down the <ORGANIZATION>National Front</ORGANIZATION>'s request to use the public meeting hall
during the meeting planned <DATE>June 5-8</DATE>.
   In <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>City Council</ORGANIZATION> held a moment of silence <DATE>Monday</DATE> in
honor of the dead whose graves were found defiled <DATE>May 10</DATE> in the
southern town of <LOCATION>Carpentras</LOCATION>.
   The desecration of the 34 graves and mutilation of a corpse
touched off a wave of vandalism in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, but also prompted public
demonstrations against a perceived rise in anti-Semitism.

   Verbal Fog Obscures Holocaust

<SO>
WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A7

   What does the Nazi murder of the Jews mean to Europeans
who are now building a new political order on their
continent? In "One, By One, By One: Facing the Holocaust"
(Simon &amp; Schuster, 318 pages, $21.95), Judith Miller, deputy
media editor of the New York Times, delivers a
country-by-country account of how Europeans distort their
past for maximum comfort. They package it, she says, instead
of thinking about it.
   "In every country . . .," writes Ms. Miller, "a
particularly national form of self-deception has usually
triumphed over self-revelation." Germany is the country with
the most responsibility for these individual tragedies, and,
Ms. Miller notes, the one that's spent the most time thinking
about that responsibility. Reflection, though, has brought
West Germans only "superficial tranquility." She takes a
lucid look at international controversies such as President
Reagan's visit to Bitburg. But her preferred tack is to study
the specific: how an old lady, Henny Oppenheimer, an exile
from the Nazis, returns to her hometown of Fulda and
discovers the grave of her first love, a slender fellow with
a musical voice; and how her meetings with living Fulda
residents resonate with strong feelings.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "In <LOCATION>Fulda</LOCATION>," reported a <ORGANIZATION>Stanford</ORGANIZATION> student from a survivor
family, " `the Holocaust' was no longer an abstraction.
Suddenly, I was at the scene of the crime, the place where my
grandfather was murdered." Such town encounters, <PERSON>Ms. Miller</PERSON>
writes, help Germans build their new country and help
outsiders come to terms with post-Hitler "Deutschland." "Only
if the Germans fully confront their past can their neighbors
come to believe that history will not repeat itself."
   <PERSON>Ms. Miller</PERSON> is tougher on <LOCATION>Austria</LOCATION>. Since the war's end,
Austrians have clung to what she labels the "Sound of Music"
version of their history. They prefer to see themselves like
the von <PERSON>Trapp</PERSON> family in the film, as victims of their Nazi
overlords. Most real Austrians could barely stop clapping
when the Germans rolled into <LOCATION>Vienna</LOCATION>.
   Modern Austrians show no remorse, as they staunchly
support their ex-Nazi president <PERSON>Kurt Waldheim</PERSON>, who covered up
his complicity with the German army while he served as <ORGANIZATION>United
Nations</ORGANIZATION> secretary general in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. The way <PERSON>Ms. Miller</PERSON>
sees it, the Austrians elected him partly because they hated
the way the world wouldn't accept their own lying image of
themselves as victims of German tyranny. She seems to agree
with an Austrian Jew who feels today's seemingly tolerant
youth will one day become "more anti-Semitic 50-year-olds."
   The view isn't so bleak in the <LOCATION>Netherlands</LOCATION>. But <PERSON>Ms. Miller</PERSON>
says the Dutch launder their war guilt by making a great show
of reverence for their most famous martyr to the <LOCATION>Holocaust</LOCATION>.
They have more or less canonized <PERSON>Anne Frank</PERSON>, the teen-age
diarist whom Dutch friends hid for two years, before Nazis
grabbed her and starved her to death at <LOCATION>Bergen-Belsen</LOCATION>.
   Occupied <LOCATION>Holland</LOCATION>, of course, was a mixed bag. Many of the
Dutch truly were Nazi victims. But their <PERSON>Anne Frank</PERSON> obsession
also has produced what <PERSON>Ms. Miller</PERSON> sees as an unwarranted
righteousness that ignores instances of Dutch collaboration:
". . . we prefer to blame the Germans," explains one
interviewee. "We say to ourselves it was all their fault;
even young people who have no memory of the war do so."
   As for <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, intellectuals seem to have done the most
damage here of all. The French do discuss the Holocaust --
<PERSON>Ms. Miller</PERSON> describes a debate over <LOCATION>Vichy</LOCATION> collaboration that
spoils a presidential dinner party in the <LOCATION>Elysee Palace</LOCATION>. But
endless salon talk about the trial of "the Butcher of <LOCATION>Lyon</LOCATION>,"
<PERSON>Klaus Barbie</PERSON>, "seemed to skim across the surface of French
society," and did little but win votes for the <ORGANIZATION>National
Front</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>'s ultra-right party.
   <PERSON>Ms. Miller</PERSON> does a successful if wandering job of summing
up smaller countries, but her real talent shows when she gets
to bigger fish, like the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>. Because Soviet
ideology leans so heavily on the memory of what Russians call
"the Great Patriotic War," Soviet history is proving the
hardest of all to revise. To distract attention from the site
of the horrible massacre at <LOCATION>Katyn</LOCATION>, where Soviets murdered
more than 4,000 Polish officers in <DATE>1943</DATE>, the U.S.S.R. set up
an ersatz memorial at a nearby town with a similar name,
"Khatyn." The victims at Khatyn happened, conveniently, to be
Soviet citizens incinerated when Germans burned this town to
the ground. Now the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> is filling in the "white
spots" in its history, and has publicly acknowledged the
Soviet responsibility for <LOCATION>Katyn</LOCATION>. But, <PERSON>Ms. Miller</PERSON> notes, a
complete rewrite of history is unlikely to come before the
<LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> faces change more profound than <PERSON>Mikhail
Gorbachev</PERSON> has brought.
   The <PERSON>Miller</PERSON> tour also makes a stop in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, visiting
Holocaust archives and talking to survivors. But her real
target is <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>'s glibly self-exculpatory
intellectuals, hiding away the death camps in a truly final
solution of verbal fog. "Abstraction," she writes, "is
memory's most ardent enemy." The best way to deal with the
Holocaust is to skip symbols and theory, and look at what
actually happened case by case -- "one by one."

<TEXT>
WHEN the votes were counted in the <ORGANIZATION>French National Assembly</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, <PERSON>Mr
Philippe Seguin</PERSON>, the maverick champion of old-style Gaullist values, was
jubilant. In the quixotic hope of throwing out the <ORGANIZATION>Maastricht Treaty of
European Union</ORGANIZATION> lock, stock and barrel, he had just delivered a mammoth
diatribe, lasting nearly 2  1/2 hours, designed to prove the whole exercise
was incompatible with the constitution and the soul of <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>.
He failed by a wide margin but chalked up a bigger score than anyone
expected. Of the 569 members voting, 101 cast their ballot against the
<ORGANIZATION>Maastricht Treaty</ORGANIZATION>, including nearly half the 126 members of his own <ORGANIZATION>Gaullist
Party</ORGANIZATION>.
The government was disturbed at such a large anti-Treaty vote but the
Gaullist party leadership, which had tried to tread an ambivalent line of
half-hearted scepticism, was appalled at the scale of the split in the
party.
Nobody seriously expects <PERSON>Mr Seguin</PERSON> can prevent ratification of the
<ORGANIZATION>Maastricht Treaty</ORGANIZATION>. With the Socialists, the Centrists, and the centre-right
<ORGANIZATION>UDF</ORGANIZATION> umbrella grouping, the government can still probably count on a solid
majority, even without the Gaullists.
Yet <PERSON>Mr Seguin</PERSON>'s oratorical tour de force, set off powerful patriotic
vibrations with a large minority of his fellow parliamentarians, which may
yet create uncertainty in the ratification process.
He rallied support from nationalists across the political spectrum,
including 4 votes from the centre and centre-right, and all 26 Communists;
<PERSON>Mr Jean-Pierre Chevenement</PERSON>, the maverick Socialist and leader of a small
clan of 5 left-wing Gaullists in the <ORGANIZATION>Socialist Party</ORGANIZATION>, warmly congratulated
<PERSON>Mr Seguin</PERSON> for his very 'Republican' speech.
<PERSON>Philippe Seguin</PERSON> has long been a disturber of the peace in the <ORGANIZATION>Gaullist
Party</ORGANIZATION>. He served as social affairs minister in the government of <PERSON>Mr Jacques
Chirac</PERSON> in <DATE>1986-88</DATE>; but after <PERSON>Mr Chirac</PERSON>'s defeat in the <DATE>1988</DATE> presidential
elections, <PERSON>Mr Seguin</PERSON> challenged <PERSON>Mr Chirac</PERSON>'s status as party leader.
A year later he joined a short-lived rebellion of young Gaullists in a
protest against the stranglehold of <LOCATION>Chirac</LOCATION>; but after it was put down
promptly recanted.
In relation to President <PERSON>Mitterrand</PERSON>'s ambitions for a more integrated <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION>
however, <PERSON>Seguin</PERSON>'s attitude has been one of consistent hostility.
<PERSON>Mr Seguin</PERSON> was born and brought up in <LOCATION>Tunisia</LOCATION> before its independence, and
some people link his passionate French patriotism to his pied-noir origins.
Whatever the psychological springs, <PERSON>Mr Seguin</PERSON> remains an unreconstructed
Gaullist, in an era when it is less fashionable and less feasible.
His European convictions derive in every detail from <ORGANIZATION>General de Gaulle</ORGANIZATION>'s
passionate faith in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>'s future as an independent and sovereign country,
and his hostility to the supranational undertones of the <ORGANIZATION>European Community</ORGANIZATION>.
'Without a currency tomorrow, without a defence', said <PERSON>Mr Seguin</PERSON> on
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, 'without a diplomacy the day after, <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> would at best have as
little freedom of manoeuvre as <LOCATION>Ukraine</LOCATION> or <LOCATION>Azerbaijan</LOCATION>. Some people can accept
that; but it is not the future that I want for my country'.
'The logic of the economic and political process put together at <LOCATION>Maastricht</LOCATION>,
is that of a cut-price federalism, fundamentally anti-democratic, falsely
liberal, deliberately technocratic. The <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> they are offering us ..
buries the concept of national sovereignty and the great principles born of
the Revolution.
Like de <LOCATION>Gaulle</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Seguin</PERSON>'s vision of <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> is of a loose congeries of freely
cooperating sovereign states, in what used to be summed up as 'L'Europe des
Patries'.
As a corollary, he believes in a wide extension of this <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> to include
all the countries of the continent.
De Gaulle remains a hero for many Frenchmen because he restored their
self-respect after the shame of <LOCATION>Vichy</LOCATION>, and appeared to promise <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> a
great future as a great power.
In <DATE>1958</DATE> many thought De Gaulle might reject the fledgeling <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION>. Instead he
announced: 'We shall enter the Common Market as agreed. We shall enter, but
upright'.
These were the words <PERSON>Philippe Seguin</PERSON> chose for his peroration. 'Yes, we want
<LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, but upright'. A romantic cry of protest for what he must have known
was likely to be a lost cause.

   As an actor, <PERSON>Charles Lane</PERSON> isn't the inheritor of <PERSON>Charlie Chaplin</PERSON>'s spirit. 
<PERSON>Steve Martin</PERSON> has already laid his claim to that. 

   But it is <PERSON>Mr. Lane</PERSON>, as movie director, producer and writer, who has been obsessed with refitting <PERSON>Chaplin</PERSON>'s Little Tramp in a contemporary way. 
In <DATE>1976</DATE>, as a film student at the <LOCATION>Purchase</LOCATION> campus of the <ORGANIZATION>State University of New York</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Lane</PERSON> shot "A Place in Time," a 36-minute black-and-white film about a sketch artist, a man of the streets. 
Now, 13 years later, <PERSON>Mr. Lane</PERSON> has revived his Artist in a full-length movie called "Sidewalk Stories," a poignant piece of work about a modern-day tramp. 
Of course, if the film contained dialogue, <PERSON>Mr. Lane</PERSON>'s Artist would be called a homeless person. 
So would the Little Tramp, for that matter. 

   I say "contained dialogue" because "Sidewalk Stories" isn't really silent at all. 
Composer <PERSON>Marc Marder</PERSON>, a college friend of <PERSON>Mr. Lane</PERSON>'s who earns his living playing the double bass in classical music ensembles, has prepared an exciting, eclectic score that tells you what the characters are thinking and feeling far more precisely than intertitles, or even words, would. 

   Much of <PERSON>Mr. Lane</PERSON>'s film takes a highly romanticized view of life on the streets (though probably no more romanticized than <PERSON>Mr. Chaplin</PERSON>'s notion of the Tramp as the good-hearted free spirit). 
Filmed in lovely black and white by <PERSON>Bill Dill</PERSON>, the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> streets of "Sidewalk Stories" seem benign. 
On Wall Street men and women walk with great purpose, noticing one another only when they jostle for cabs. 
The Artist hangs out in <LOCATION>Greenwich Village</LOCATION>, on a strip of Sixth Avenue populated by jugglers, magicians and other good-natured hustlers. (This clearly is not real life: no crack dealers, no dead-eyed men selling four-year-old copies of Cosmopolitan, no one curled up in a cardboard box.) 

   The Artist has his routine. 
He spends his days sketching passers-by, or trying to. 
At night he returns to the condemned building he calls home. 
His life, including his skirmishes with a competing sketch artist, seems carefree. 
He is his own man. 

   Then, just as the Tramp is given a blind girl to cure in "City Lights," the Artist is put in charge of returning a two-year-old waif (<PERSON>Nicole Alysia</PERSON>), whose father has been murdered by thugs, to her mother. 
This cute child turns out to be a blessing and a curse. 
She gives the Artist a sense of purpose, but also alerts him to the serious inadequacy of his vagrant life. 
The beds at the <ORGANIZATION>Bowery Mission</ORGANIZATION> seem far drearier when he has to tuck a little girl into one of them at night. 

   To further load the stakes, <PERSON>Mr. Lane</PERSON> dreamed up a highly improbable romance for the Artist, with a young woman who owns her own children's shop and who lives in an expensive high-rise apartment building. 
This story line might resonate more strongly if <PERSON>Mr. Lane</PERSON> had as strong a presence in front of the camera as he does behind it. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Lane</PERSON>'s final purpose isn't to glamorize the Artist's vagabond existence. 
He has a point he wants to make, and he makes it, with a great deal of force. 
The movie ends with sound, the sound of street people talking, and there isn't anything whimsical or enviable in those rough, beaten voices.

   The French film maker <PERSON>Claude Chabrol</PERSON> has managed another kind of weird achievement with his "Story of Women." 
He has made a harsh, brilliant picture -- one that's captivating -- about a character who, viewed from the most sympathetic angle, would seem disagreeable. 

   Yet this woman, <PERSON>Marie-Louise Giraud</PERSON>, carries historical significance, both as one of the last women to be executed in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> and as a symbol of the <PERSON>Vichy</PERSON> government's hypocrisy. 
While <PERSON>Vichy</PERSON> collaborated with the Germans during World War II in the deaths of thousands of Resistance fighters and Jews, its officials needed a diversionary symbolic traitor. 
Marie-Louise, a small-time abortionist, was their woman. 

   She became an abortionist accidentally, and continued because it enabled her to buy jam, cocoa and other war-rationed goodies. 
She was untrained and, in one botched job killed a client. 
Her remorse was shallow and brief. 
Although she was kind and playful to her children, she was dreadful to her war-damaged husband; she openly brought her lover into their home. 
As presented by <PERSON>Mr. Chabrol</PERSON>, and played with thin-lipped intensity by <PERSON>Isabelle Huppert</PERSON>, <PERSON>Marie-Louise</PERSON> (called <PERSON>Marie Latour</PERSON> in the film) was not a nice person. 
But she didn't deserve to have her head chopped off. 

   ---

   There is very little to recommend "Old Gringo," a confused rendering of the <PERSON>Carlos Fuentes</PERSON> novel of the Mexican Revolution. 
Most of the picture is taken up with endless scenes of many people either fighting or eating and drinking to celebrate victory. 
I mention the picture only because many bad movies have a bright spot, and this one has <PERSON>Gregory Peck</PERSON>, in a marvelously loose and energetic portrayal of an old man who wants to die the way he wants to die.

   Video Tip: Before seeing "Sidewalk Stories," take a look at "City Lights," <PERSON>Chaplin</PERSON>'s Tramp at his finest.
