   Two centuries after the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> was
founded as a largely agricultural nation, nearly nine-tenths of the
population growth is occurring in metropolitan areas, the <ORGANIZATION>Census
Bureau</ORGANIZATION> reports.
   Almost half of all Americans reside in just 37 major urban
areas, the bureau said <DATE>Thursday</DATE> in a new analysis of the patterns
of growth. And the metropolitan share of the population is growing
faster than that in rural areas.
   The ``rural renaissance'' reported in the <DATE>1970s</DATE> when small towns
and rural areas were growing seems to have ended, with increases in
cities and suburbs now well in the lead.
   The census study found that about <PERCENT>86 percent</PERCENT> of the nation's
population growth since <DATE>1980</DATE> has occurred in the 282 officially
designated metropolitan areas across the country. That pattern
represents a return to the metropolitan area dominance that has
been common since the era of the <ORGANIZATION>Great Depression</ORGANIZATION>, the bureau
reported.
   The analysis of <DATE>1987</DATE> figures found that nearly half of all
Americans, <PERCENT>48.9 percent</PERCENT>, reside in the 37 metro areas with
populations of a million or more.
   Led by <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, these metro areas had 119
million residents in <DATE>1987</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>Bureau</ORGANIZATION> said.
   <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> leads the way as the only state entirely included
within metropolitan areas, the bureau noted. The northern portion
of the state is included in the greater <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> metro area while
the southern portion is part of the <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> region.
   Seven other states have more than <PERCENT>90 percent</PERCENT> of their
populations in metropolitan areas _ <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Maryland</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Rhode Island</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>.
   Idaho is the least metropolitan state with only about <PERCENT>20 percent</PERCENT>
of its residents in urban areas, the report added.
   Reflecting the nation's overall population trend, metropolitan
area growth has tended to flow to the South and <LOCATION>West</LOCATION> in recent
years, the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> observed in its study of growth patterns
between <DATE>1980</DATE> and <DATE>1987</DATE>.
   The population loss experienced in the <LOCATION>Northeast</LOCATION> during the
<DATE>1970s</DATE> has halted in this decade, the agency found, while the
<LOCATION>Midwest</LOCATION> has continued to have net losses in recent years.
   ``A slowdown in population growth has taken place since <DATE>1980</DATE> in
much of the interior of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, especially in
nonmetropolitan areas,'' noted the report prepared by <PERSON>Donald E.
Starsinic</PERSON> and <PERSON>Richard L. Forstall</PERSON>.
   During this decade the nonmetropolitan population declined in 10
contiguous states _ <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>North Dakota</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>South Dakota</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION>, the
bureau pointed out.
   The nation's metro areas with 1 million or more residents, as of
<DATE>July 1, 1987</DATE>, were <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, 18.0 million; <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, 13.5

<HEAD>Study Projects Little Change from Census Adjustments</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new study concludes that skewing the <ORGANIZATION>Census
Bureau</ORGANIZATION>'s national headcount, as has been proposed in various forms
by lawmakers and special interest groups, would make little
difference in the allocation of <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> seats.
   Population shifts since <DATE>1980</DATE> are expected to result in the shift
of 18 or more seats, various experts agree.
   But even combining the various suggested adjustments would shift
a maximum of just four additional seats among <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION>, population analyst <PERSON>William P.
O'Hare</PERSON> reports.
   ``It appears that none of the adjustments to Census figures that
are being urged upon the bureau are likely to make a big difference
in the overall apportionment of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>,'' O'Hare reported in the
latest issue of ``Population Today,'' the newsletter of the private
<ORGANIZATION>Population Reference Bureau</ORGANIZATION>.
   The census, taken every 10 years, is required by the
Constitution to redistribute the 435 <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> seats, keeping them
relatively even in population. Because the number of <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> members
is limited, whenever a state gains a seat, another state must lose
one.
   Last year the <ORGANIZATION>Commerce Department</ORGANIZATION>, which oversees the <ORGANIZATION>Census
Bureau</ORGANIZATION>, decreed that the <DATE>1990</DATE> results would not be adjusted.
Various interest groups, however, continue to push the idea.
Several lawsuits and congressional bills have been filed seeking to
force changes.
   The main dispute over adjusting the count centers on either
increasing the totals to add minorities presumed to have been
missed or reducing the total to subtract illegal aliens or people
who are ``imputed.''
   Imputed people are those counted despite the fact that Census
officials do not actually contact them. For example, when neighbors
say someone lives at a house even though the census taker
repeatedly cannot locate those people, that person is counted.
   The suit contending minorities are undercounted was filed in
<ORGANIZATION>U.S. District Court</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Brooklyn</LOCATION> by <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>; <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>; <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>;
<LOCATION>Dade County</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla.</LOCATION>; the <ORGANIZATION>NAACP</ORGANIZATION> and groups representing Hispanics and
the nation's mayors.
   A separate suit, seeking to remove the effect of illegal aliens,
was filed in <ORGANIZATION>U.S. District Court</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION> by the <ORGANIZATION>Immigration
Reform Law Institute</ORGANIZATION> on behalf of 42 members of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>,
<LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION> and the Federation for <ORGANIZATION>American
Immigration Reform</ORGANIZATION>.
   An analysis of the <DATE>1980</DATE> census concluded that more than <PERCENT>5
percent</PERCENT> of blacks and Hispanics were missed, considerably more than
the number of whites who were said to have been uncounted. Thus,
interest groups have urged increasing the minority count in each
state by a predetermined percentage.
   Such a move would be expected to benefit states with large
minority populations, but <LOCATION>O'Hare</LOCATION>'s calculations said that would not
be the case.
   ``Interestingly,'' concluded <LOCATION>O'Hare</LOCATION>, ``minority undercount
adjustment, the modification of the census figures which has
received the most attention, would not result in the movement of
any seats between states.''
   On the other hand, he calculated that eliminating illegal aliens
from the count would result in the transfer of one <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> seat from
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>.
   ``This is not surprising when you realize that the <DATE>1980</DATE> census
figures for <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> included an estimated 1 million illegal
aliens,'' O'Hare commented. Taking them out of the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>
population would cost that state a <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> seat; <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> would
be next in line for that seat.
   Some states are more difficult to count and thus have more
imputed people than others, <LOCATION>O'Hare</LOCATION> found. He estimated that
subtracting imputed people from the count would cost <LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION> a
seat. Once again, the gainer would be <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>.
   O'Hare also calculated the results of various combinations of
these adjustments:
   _Adding in allegedly uncounted minorities and subtracting
estimated illegal aliens would move one seat from <LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION> to
<LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>.
   _Adding in minorities and subtracting the imputed people would
transfer seats from <LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION>.
   _Subtracting both illegal aliens and imputed people would move
one <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> seat from <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>.
   _Making all three adjustments would move one seat from
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>.
   The various changes calculated by O'Hare would be in addition to
reallocartions of <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> seats caused by discernable shifts in
population since <DATE>1980</DATE>.
   While the exact shifts won't be known until after the census,
the <ORGANIZATION>Population Reference Bureau</ORGANIZATION> and the private <ORGANIZATION>Election Data
Service</ORGANIZATION> have projected changes based on recent <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION>
population estimates.
   Both groups anticipate the shift of 18 seats from northern
states to the South and West, mirroring the flow of population.
   Gainers are expected to be: <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, 5; <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, 4; <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, 3;
<LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>, 2; <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION>, 2; <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION>, 1 and <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION>, 1.
   Expected to lose seats are: <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, 3; <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>, 3;
<LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>, 2; <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>, 2; <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, 2; <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>, 1; <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION>, 1;
<LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION>, 1; <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>, 1; <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION>, 1, and <LOCATION>Wisconsin</LOCATION>, 1.

<HEAD>Court Dismisses Suit On Aliens In Census</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER MATTIACE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge has dismissed a lawsuit by 42
congressmen and three states seeking to block the counting of
illegal aliens in the <DATE>1990</DATE> census, in part because they could not
prove they will lose seats in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> by reapportionment.
   The plaintiffs said they feared states with more illegal aliens
would get a disproportionate number of <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> seats and electoral
votes, thus diminishing the political power of states with fewer
illegal aliens.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> argued it is constitutionally obligated to
count everyone, including illegal aliens, for congressional
apportionment and has done so since the first census in <DATE>1790</DATE>. House
seats are redistributed every 10 years to reflect population
changes.
   <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> District <PERSON>Judge William L. Standish</PERSON> said, in a ruling filed
late <DATE>Monday</DATE>, that the plaintiffs cannot show they would be hurt by
the <DATE>1990</DATE> census because ``they are unable to establish how many
illegal aliens will be present ..., in which states these illegal
aliens will reside, or to what extent the illegal population will
come forward to be counted.''
   The lawsuit was filed last year by the congressmen, led by
<LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> Republican <PERSON>Tom Ridge</PERSON>, and the states of <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION>.
   Ridge said <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> that <PERSON>Standish</PERSON> dismissed the lawsuit ``on
technical, legal grounds and not on the merits of the <ORGANIZATION>Census
Bureau</ORGANIZATION>'s plans.''
   Ridge, recently named vice chairman of a <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> subcommittee that
oversees the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION>, said he may appeal <PERSON>Standish</PERSON>'s decision
and will introduce legislation in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> to change the method of
the <DATE>1990</DATE> count.
   Standish's opinion noted that the congressmen's demographer
offered estimates that up to 5.6 million illegal aliens will be
counted in <DATE>1990</DATE>. The demographer predicted a gain of up to four
congressional seats for <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> and one seat for <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, and the
possible loss of one seat each for <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wisconsin</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>North
Carolina</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>.
   The judge noted another congressional analyst had predicted
gains for <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> at the
expense of <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION>.
   But, the judge said, ``Based on the evidence offered, it is
sheer speculation as to the identities of the states that will be
affected by the inclusion of illegal aliens.''
   Standish also said the state governments of <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION>
and <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION> cannot show they would be damaged by ``reduced power or
prestige'' with the loss of congressional representation. He said
only the residents of the states might suffer and they did not file
the lawsuit.
   Standish noted that the non-profit <ORGANIZATION>Federation of American
Immigration Reform</ORGANIZATION>, a co-plaintiff in the lawsuit, filed a similar
legal action in <DATE>1980</DATE> that was dismissed by a three-judge federal
panel in the <LOCATION>District of Columbia</LOCATION>.
   Ridge was joined by 19 colleagues from <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>, and others
from <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Oregon</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wisconsin</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Maryland</LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Population Gains to Give Sunbelt States More Seats in Congress</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Inserts new 6th graf with 1980 population</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   The flow of Americans to <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> has pushed
the <ORGANIZATION>Golden State</ORGANIZATION> far ahead of all rivals in population and will
give it a record 52 seats in the <DATE>1992</DATE> House of Representatives, new
census figures indicate.
   Preliminary <DATE>1990</DATE> population figures show <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> picking up
seven <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> seats, followed by <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> with four, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> three and a
handful of other warm-weather states with one each.
   <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> hung on to its No. 2 ranking in population behind
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION> in the new figures _ with <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> closing fast
in third and fourth places _ but will lose three seats in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>
because its population rose only slightly in the <DATE>1980s</DATE>.
   Four Northern industrial states _ <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> _ lost population during the decade and will have two
fewer seats each.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> estimated a national count of just under 246
million, including 29.3 million in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, 17.6 million in <LOCATION>New
York</LOCATION>, 16.8 million in <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> and 12.8 million in <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>. Wyoming
was last, at just under 450,000, passed by <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION>, which had the
smallest population in <DATE>1980</DATE> but grew to almost 546,000 in <DATE>1990</DATE>.
   The total population count in <DATE>1980</DATE> was 226,545,805.
   House seats are redistributed among the states after each
Census. Because the number is limited to 435 seats, when a growing
state gains a seat some other state must lose one.
   <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>'s slight population gain was quickly disputed by state
officials, who had predicted repeatedly that the state would be
undercounted.
   ``I don't believe it,'' Gov. <PERSON>Mario Cuomo</PERSON> said in <LOCATION>Albany</LOCATION>. ``Do
you really, honestly believe that everybody who should be counted
has been counted? The answer is of course not. My mother had
trouble; she didn't want to answer.''
   <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON>David N. Dinkins</PERSON> called the city's estimated
slight decline ``unadulterated nonsense'' and promised to pinpoint
where he said the government had made errors.
   Overall 19 <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> seats will change states according to the
figures, which could change significantly before the final report
is issued <DATE>Dec. 31</DATE>.
   The widely noted movement of Americans to the Sun Belt was
documented anew in the Census Bureau figures. Besides <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, states gaining a <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> seat each were <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>.
   Besides the two-seat losers _ <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> _ there will be one less seat each for <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>West
Virginia</LOCATION>.
   Overall, the preliminary Census figures show the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>
with a population of 245,837,683 residents. That's somewhat below
the 250 million that the bureau had estimated earlier this year.
   However, 4 million or more may be added as the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION>
conducts follow up counts and completes tabulations before the
final reports are made public. If those are added in only a few
states, some of the seats allocated in the preliminary tally could
shift again.
   For example, a study by the private firm <ORGANIZATION>Election Data Services</ORGANIZATION>
showed <LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION> neck and neck for the last seat
allocated. <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION> got the seat, but a shift of 3,000 people
could shift it to <LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Kimball Brace</PERSON>, head of EDS, stressed that the figures are
subject to change.
   In addition to changes made after local officials assess the
preliminary figures, there is a chance that the final report could
be adjusted next <DATE>summer</DATE>.
   The bureau has been criticized for undercounting minorities in
the past and is conducting a post-census check on its count this
time. If officials determine that some group has been missed a
decision could be made to statistically adjust the final numbers.
   That ruling will be made by the <ORGANIZATION>Department of Commerce</ORGANIZATION> in
<DATE>mid-July 1991</DATE>.
   The national total was completed <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> with the reports for
the final four states _ <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>.
   Census officials emphasize that the figures are provided to
allow local governments to question the results in the event people
were missed or overcounted.

   Democrats are mobilizing local officials to
protest preliminary census figures and pressure the government to
take another look at the count for the nation's cities and rural
areas.
   ``I don't believe it,'' <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON>Mario Cuomo</PERSON> said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>
when the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> estimated that his state's population grew
by fewer than 70,000 during the past decade.
   ``Way out of line,'' <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON>Maynard Jackson</PERSON> said of the
estimate for his city.
   An analysis done for Democratic state legislators said the
preliminary figures for rural areas, particularly in the <LOCATION>South</LOCATION>,
were consistently below the population estimates issued by the
<ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>February</DATE>.
   With the release of numbers for <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>
and <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> completed its estimate of the
population for all 50 states.
   Overall, the preliminary census figures show the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>
with a population of 245,837,683. Ten years ago, the census set the
nation's population at 226,545,805.
   To no one's surprise, the numbers showed Americans continued to
move <LOCATION>South and West</LOCATION> during the past 10 years.
   Nineteen <ORGANIZATION>U.S. House</ORGANIZATION> seats will follow that population shift to
the Sun Belt.
   That trend was good news for Republicans, who consider the Sun
Belt the area of their strongest growth. But a similar trend in the
<DATE>1980</DATE> Census, when 17 <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> seats shifted South and West, failed to
yield expected <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> gains because most of the state legislators who
drew the new district lines were Democrats.
   The big winner when the shift takes place in time for the <DATE>1992</DATE>
election will be <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, which is expected to gain seven new
<ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> seats for a total of 52. With a population expected to push
close to 30 million, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> would have 21 more <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> seats than
the second-largest state, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>.
   Based on the preliminary population figures, <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> would gain
four <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> seats and <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> three. Picking up one each would be
<LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>.
   <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> would lose three <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> seats and <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION> two each. Losing one seat each would be <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION>.
   Officials who think the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> missed a lot of people in
their areas have 15 working days to submit information to support
claims they were undercounted.
   Mayor <PERSON>David Dinkins</PERSON> of <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> called the estimate that his
city lost 40,000 people ``unadulterated nonsense'' and pledged to
``comb through the bureau's data to locate those areas where the
count is too low, identifying housing units the bureau overlooked
and buildings it missed entirely.''
   ``Do you really honestly believe everybody who should be counted
was counted?'' Cuomo asked. Answering his own question, the
governor said, ``Of course not. My mother had trouble. She didn't
want to answer.''
   Rep. <PERSON>Vic Fazio</PERSON> of <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>House Democratic</ORGANIZATION>
group monitoring reapportionment, urged local officials to
challenge the preliminary figures.
   ``Now is not the time to be ringing partisan alarm bells,'' said
<PERSON>Fazio</PERSON>. ``But when a Republican administration is on a track leading
us to a less than fair and accurate census count, Democrats must
challenge at every opportunity available.''
   <PERSON>Kimball Brace</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Election Data Services</ORGANIZATION>, a consulting
firm that analyzes census data for Democratic state legislators,
told a news conference that the figures were subject to
considerable adjustment before the government comes out with final
numbers on <DATE>Dec. 31</DATE>. Even then, the <ORGANIZATION>Commerce Department</ORGANIZATION> will have
until <DATE>July 15, 1991</DATE>, to determine whether to adjust for an
undercount.
   Brace said he understood the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> has found up to 4
million additional people but has not yet included them in the
state figures. He said no estimate was available on where those
people are distributed among the states.
   Brace cited <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Tennessee</LOCATION> as states where
figures for rural areas were well below earlier estimates.

   If the two sides trying to force changes in
the <DATE>1990</DATE> census both get their way, the results would nearly
balance one another, a population expert said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> is under pressure to exclude illegal aliens
from its national head count. Traditionally, it counts everyone
living in the country.
   Groups which have filed suit to ignore the aliens contend large
concentrations of them could result in in some states gaining seats
in the <ORGANIZATION>House of Representatives</ORGANIZATION> at the expense of other states.
   Meanwhile, other groups want the final census totals to be
increased to account for people who may be overlooked in the census
_ most often blacks and Hispanics living in urban areas.
   At stake are the 435 seats in the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION>, which are distributed
among the states on the basis of population.
   ``If both sides get their way, the only change would be a
flip-flop of one seat from <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON>William
O'Hare</PERSON>, director of policy studies for the independent <ORGANIZATION>Population
Reference Bureau</ORGANIZATION>.
   O'Hare told a breakfast briefing for <ORGANIZATION>Northeast</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Midwest</LOCATION>
members of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> that he estimates their region will lose 14
<ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> seats following the <DATE>1990</DATE> census. That would continue a trend
evident over the last several decades, he noted.
   Using estimates of the number of illegal aliens and undercounted
minorities, he said that deleting the one group and adding in the
other would make little difference in the long run.
   The only change, he said, would be that <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> would gain
five new seats instead of six, while <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION> would add two rather
than just one.
   ``That's easy to understand, since there are so many
undocumented aliens in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>,'' he commented.
   O'Hare's study of potential changes in <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> seats _ based on
<DATE>1990</DATE> projections with no adjustments _ calls for <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> to be
the big gainer, adding six <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> seats, followed by <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> with a
gain of four and <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> adding three.
   Expected to pick up one seat each are <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>.
   On the other hand <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> would lose three seats. States losing
two apiece would be <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Illinois</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>.
Expected to lose one house seat are <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wisconsin</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>.

   The fast-growing <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> metropolitan area
jumped two spots to surpass both <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION> <DATE>last year</DATE>,
the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> reports.
   New population estimates for the nation's metropolitan areas show
few changes among the top 25 urban areas, with <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> still firmly
in first place, followed by <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>.
   The biggest move among the 25 largest communities was by <LOCATION>San
Diego</LOCATION>, which rose from 19th in <DATE>1987</DATE> to 17th last year. It added
84,100 people, climbing to 2,370,400 metro-area residents.
   That pushed the <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION> city past <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION>. <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION> was listed with 2,342,500 residents, up 31,900
from the year before, and <LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION> declined 7,900, to 2,284,100.
   Not far down the list, fast-growing <LOCATION>Phoenix</LOCATION> pushed past the
burgeoning Tampa-St. Petersburg region.
   Phoenix added 51,500 residents over the year to climb to
2,029,500 and rise one spot to the nation's 20th largest metro area.
Tampa-St. Petersburg dropped to 21st, despite a gain of 38,000
people for a <DATE>1988</DATE> total of 1,995,100.
   While revised <DATE>1987</DATE> figures contained in the new report indicate
that <LOCATION>Phoenix</LOCATION> actually moved ahead of Tampa-St. Petersburg in that
year, the <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> metropolitan area had been listed as the larger of
the two on the basis of preliminary <DATE>1987</DATE> estimates.
   The <LOCATION>Kansas City</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mo.</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Kansas City</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kan.</LOCATION>, metro area edged up
one spot to 24th, passing Milwaukee-Racine, which fell to 25th.
   The calculations are for metropolitan areas, which are officially
defined by the <ORGANIZATION>federal Office of Management and Budget</ORGANIZATION>. These
regional designations are used for federal statistical purposes.
Generally they consist of central cities of at least 50,000 people
and the surrounding regions that are economically interrelated.
   Here is a rundown on the nation's 25 most populous metropolitan
areas, their estimated populations as of <DATE>1988</DATE>, and the change from
the year before.

<TEXT>
   With political strength following population,
new <DATE>1990</DATE> Census projections give <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> a
rosy outlook.
   <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> would jump to 50 members of the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION>, a gain of
five, according to an analysis by the <ORGANIZATION>Library of Congress</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>David C. Huckabee</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Library's Congressional Research
Service</ORGANIZATION> recalculated the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> distribution based on the new <ORGANIZATION>Census
Bureau</ORGANIZATION> projections of populations in <DATE>1990</DATE>. The estimates were
released <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   Huckabee cautioned, however, that his calculation is based on
estimates, and a very small change in population can shift a <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION>
seat from one state to another.
   In <DATE>1970</DATE>, for example, a difference of fewer than 300 people gave
<LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION> rather than <LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION> an additional <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> seat, he said.
   With <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> seats limited to 435, every gain by one state means a
loss for another.
   In addition to <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Huckabee</PERSON> calculated that <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> would
gain four new seats in the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> would gain three.
   Adding two seats would be <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION>, while <LOCATION>North
Carolina</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> would each pick up one.
   On the other hand, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> would each drop
three seats, he calculated. Losing two apiece would be <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>. Expected to lose one would be <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Wisconsin</LOCATION>.
   Huckabee's figures differ slightly from those of <LOCATION>William O'Hare</LOCATION>
at the private <ORGANIZATION>Population Reference Bureau</ORGANIZATION>, who used a different
set of <DATE>1990</DATE> estimates.
   <ORGANIZATION>Election Data Services</ORGANIZATION>, a private consulting firm, also issued
somewhat different reapportionment estimates earlier this year,
based on <DATE>1987</DATE> Census estimates.

<HEAD>Census Shows 249.6 Million Americans; Sun Belt Still a Gainer</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation grew to 249.6 million people in the
<DATE>1980s</DATE> as more Americans left the industrial and agricultural
heartlands for the South and <LOCATION>West</LOCATION>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION>'s first ``final'' figures from the <DATE>1990</DATE>
census, released <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, showed the pull of the Sun Belt
remained strong, despite efforts by the industrial North to promote
growth and the collapse during the <DATE>1980s</DATE> of the oil and savings and
loan industries - two mainstays of the Southern and Western states.
   The census figures are used to adjust the number of
representatives each state sends to <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> so that political
clout is in line with population. The figures also determine the
division of federal money among states and localities.
   The numbers could change next <DATE>summer</DATE> when the <ORGANIZATION>Commerce
Department</ORGANIZATION> decides whether to adjust the count. Some states and
cities are likely to challenge the tallies, whichever way the
adjustment decision goes.
   More than 6,000 local governments challenged the accuracy of a
preliminary count based mainly on the <DATE>April 1</DATE> census taken by mail.
The <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> responded with a series of recounts and an ad
campaign urging people who thought they had been missed to come
forward.
   In <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, Mayor <PERSON>David Dinkins</PERSON> criticized the count released
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, saying it underestimated the city's population and as a
result will cost the city <MONEY>millions of dollars</MONEY> in federal funds each
year.
   ``Since at least <DATE>1940</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>Commerce Department</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Census
Bureau</ORGANIZATION> have systematically under counted Americans of color and
Americans who live in cities,'' <PERSON>Dinkins</PERSON> said at a <ORGANIZATION>City Hall</ORGANIZATION> news
conference.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION>'s final national population total was nearly 4
million people more than the preliminary number it released earlier
this year.
   Five states, all in the South or West, grew by more than a
fourth in the decade: <LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION>, up <PERCENT>50.7 percent</PERCENT>; <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION>, <PERCENT>37.4
percent</PERCENT>; <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>, <PERCENT>35.3 percent</PERCENT>; <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, <PERCENT>33.4 percent</PERCENT>; and
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, <PERCENT>26.1 percent</PERCENT>.
   The six states having growth of less than <PERCENT>1 percent</PERCENT> included
some industrial powerhouses: <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>, up <PERCENT>0.4 percent</PERCENT>;
<LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>, <PERCENT>0.5 percent</PERCENT>; <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>, <PERCENT>0.7 percent</PERCENT>; and <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, <PERCENT>0.8
percent</PERCENT>. Grain-growing <LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION> grew by a bare <PERCENT>0.9 percent</PERCENT>.
<LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION>, hard hit by the collapse in oil prices in the <DATE>1980s</DATE>,
grew <PERCENT>0.8 percent</PERCENT>.
   Five states lost population. The biggest percentage loser was
<LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION>, whose population dropped by <PERCENT>7.6 percent</PERCENT> to
1,801,625. Other states losing population were <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>, down <PERCENT>4.3
percent</PERCENT>; <LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION>, down <PERCENT>2.9 percent</PERCENT>; and <LOCATION>North Dakota</LOCATION>, down <PERCENT>1.7
percent</PERCENT>. The <ORGANIZATION>District of Columbia</ORGANIZATION> also lost population, <PERCENT>4.5
percent</PERCENT>.
   America's population grew at a slower pace in the <DATE>1980s</DATE> than in
decades past: <PERCENT>10.2 percent</PERCENT>, compared with <PERCENT>11.4 percent</PERCENT> in the <DATE>1970s</DATE>
and <PERCENT>13.4 percent</PERCENT> in the <DATE>1960s</DATE>.
   This year's population count, 249,632,692, for the first time
included some Americans living abroad. The <DATE>1980</DATE> population figure,
226,504,825, counted only people living within the nation's
borders.
   <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>'s release was only the first burst of what will be a
barrage of census numbers detailing not only the number of people
but their ages, races, housing situations, incomes and a wealth of
other data.
   The last figures in the <MONEY>$2.6 billion</MONEY> census won't be released
until <DATE>1993</DATE>.
   All regions had more people in <DATE>1990</DATE> compared with 10 years
earlier. The <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Mountain</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>South Atlantic</LOCATION> regions had the
sharpest growth, and the <ORGANIZATION>East North Central</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>West North Central</LOCATION> and
<ORGANIZATION>East South Central</ORGANIZATION> regions had the slowest.
   The Pacific states were the fastest growing region, <PERCENT>23.4
percent</PERCENT>, followed by the Mountain states, <PERCENT>20.6 percent</PERCENT>, and the
<LOCATION>South Atlantic</LOCATION> states, <PERCENT>18.8 percent</PERCENT>. In the <DATE>1970s</DATE> those regions had
each showed double-digit growth.
   By contrast, the <ORGANIZATION>East North Central</ORGANIZATION> states grew a bare <PERCENT>1.1
percent</PERCENT>; the <LOCATION>West North Central</LOCATION> states, <PERCENT>3.1 percent</PERCENT>; and the <LOCATION>East
South Central</LOCATION> states, <PERCENT>3.9 percent</PERCENT>. Those numbers represented a
falloff from each region's growth in the <DATE>1970s</DATE>.
   Other facts from the census release:
   -<LOCATION>Besides California</LOCATION>, states gaining representatives will be
<LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, four; <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, three; and <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, one seat each.
   -States losing representatives will be <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, three;
<LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>, two each; and <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION>, one each.
   -The <DATE>1990</DATE> census counted 922,819 members of the armed forces,
civilian employees of the federal government and their dependents
living abroad. Other Americans living overseas weren't counted.

   Census Bureau Adds 3.8 Million to Count
   But Critics Say Millions Remain Missing

<LP>
   WASHINGTON -- The Census Bureau added 3.8 million more
people to its 1990 headcount, but critics continue to
complain that the bureau is missing millions more.
   The bureau said yesterday that its almost-final tally from
the 1990 census is 249,632,692 people, 10.2% more than the
1980 census found.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The addition of 3.8 million people to the preliminary
total released this <DATE>summer</DATE> reflects 2.9 million residents the
bureau missed the first time as well as the anticipated
922,819 military and other federal employees and dependents
overseas.
   Under the Constitution, the new headcount will result in a
shift of 19 seats in the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. House of Representatives</ORGANIZATION>.
   <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> is the big winner, adding seven seats to give
it 52 representatives, or nearly <PERCENT>12%</PERCENT> of all the seats in the
435-member <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> is the big loser. It will lose
three seats and end up with 31 seats after the <DATE>1992</DATE> election.
   The <DATE>1990</DATE> tally includes military and other federal workers
and dependents living overseas. The <DATE>1980</DATE> tally didn't.
Excluding those people, the resident population of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
grew by <PERCENT>9.8%</PERCENT> during the <DATE>1980s</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON>Barbara
Bryant</PERSON> said.
   The bureau may yet make additional adjustments to the
tally. Under terms of an out-of-court settlement of a lawsuit
brought by <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION> and others who argued that the
census disproportionately misses minorities, the <ORGANIZATION>Commerce
Department</ORGANIZATION> must decide by <DATE>July 15</DATE> whether to adjust the
tallies statistically to compensate for the undercount.
Commerce Undersecretary <PERSON>Michael Darby</PERSON> yesterday called the
<DATE>1990</DATE> census "full, fair and efficient."
   But congressional skepticism persists. "It's not a
question of whether we have counted everyone. The census
never does," said Rep. <PERSON>Thomas Sawyer</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>), chairman of
the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> census subcommittee. "The question is how close
they've come to the truth."
   <ORGANIZATION>New York State Attorney</ORGANIZATION> General <PERSON>Robert Abrams</PERSON>, among those
suing the bureau, was quick to complain that the <DATE>1990</DATE> census
still undercounted his state. "When large segments of our
residents are left out of the political process, democracy is
devalued for all of us," he said.
   Additions to the preliminary tally reflect, among other
things, recanvassing of a substantial number of housing units
by census enumerators. With aid from state and local
governments, the bureau also identified about 125,000 housing
units it had missed. It also turned up an extra 400,000
people from parole records, <PERSON>Mrs. Bryant</PERSON> said recently.
   <PERSON>Mr. Darby</PERSON> noted that the new tally is "surprisingly close"
to earlier projections that the census would find a
population of 250 million. But Rep. <PERSON>Sawyer</PERSON> noted that the
249.6 million total is still substantially shy of the
bureau's recent projections, based on demographic data, of
253.4 million.
   The <DATE>1990</DATE> census confirms trends identified in earlier
reports, such as the rapid growth of the western states. "The
West is the big population gainer," <PERSON>Mrs. Bryant</PERSON> said. In the
past decade, the population of the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION> has grown by <PERCENT>22%</PERCENT>,
while the South grew by <PERCENT>13.5%</PERCENT>, the Northeast by <PERCENT>3.4%</PERCENT>, and the
<LOCATION>Midwest</LOCATION> by <PERCENT>1.3%</PERCENT>.
   The reassignment of seats in the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> reflects these
trends, with the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION> and Sunbelt states gaining at the
expense of the big industrial states of the <LOCATION>Northeast</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Midwest</LOCATION>. In addition to <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, states adding seats
include <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, which gains four seats; <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, which gains
three seats; and <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION>
and <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, which each gain one seat.
   Besides <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, states losing seats include <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>, which each lose two seats;
and <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION>, which each lose one
seat.
   None of these shifts comes as a surprise, however. Earlier
bureau reports on the <DATE>1990</DATE> count pointed to all of them.
   The figures may provide new ammunition for the <ORGANIZATION>District of
Columbia</ORGANIZATION>'s perennially unsuccessful campaign for statehood.
Although the census found that the district lost population
during the <DATE>1980s</DATE>, it still is larger than either <LOCATION>Vermont</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION> or <LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION>. Yet the district hasn't any seats in the
<ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>, and its one representative in the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> can't vote.
   The bureau also noted yesterday that four states lost
population in the <DATE>1980s</DATE>. They are <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>North Dakota</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>West
Virginia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION>.

<HEAD>New Census Figures Could Affect Reapportionment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Census Bureau figures released today indicate
that seven states are likely to gain seats in the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. House of
Representatives</ORGANIZATION> in reapportionment, while as many as a dozen states
will lose at least one seat, forecasters say.
   The next reapportionment will be based on the final <DATE>1990</DATE> Census
figures, which will be collected in the 10-year census next year.
The state population figures released <DATE>today</DATE> go up to mid-1989 and
represent one last checkpoint before the final, official count.
   The non-profit <ORGANIZATION>Population Reference Bureau</ORGANIZATION> said that if the
trends in this latest report hold true through the final <DATE>1990</DATE>
figures, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> will gain seven seats, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> each
will gain three, and <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>
will gain one apiece.
   At the same time, 11 states are likely to lose one or more
seats, the <ORGANIZATION>Population Reference Bureau</ORGANIZATION> said. It said <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> will
lose three seats, <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION> each
will lose two, and <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>West
Virginia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> each will lose one.
   Comparable predictions by <ORGANIZATION>Election Data Services Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a
Washington-based political consulting firm, differed little. The
firm, however, added <LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION> to the list of losers, dropping one
congressional seat, and predicted that <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> will gain four
seats, rather than three.
   However, the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> figures on which the predictions are
based do not include members of the military and their dependents
living overseas. They will be counted in the <DATE>1990</DATE> reapportionment,
the government recently announced, and that change could mean the
difference in whether some states gain or lose a seat.
   The Census figures show that the populations of five states grew
at rates faster than <PERCENT>10 percent</PERCENT> <DATE>from 1985</DATE> to mid-1989.
   The state that experienced the largest percentage increase in
population between <DATE>1985</DATE> and mid-1989, <LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION>, grew by <PERCENT>18 percent</PERCENT>.
Second was <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>, <PERCENT>12 percent</PERCENT>, followed by <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New
Hampshire</LOCATION> at <PERCENT>11 percent</PERCENT> and <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> at <PERCENT>10 percent</PERCENT>.
   At the same time, seven states lost population, the bureau said:
<LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>North Dakota</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
   The populations of five states grew at rates
faster than <PERCENT>10 percent</PERCENT> in the <DATE>last half of the 1980s</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>Census
Bureau</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>Thursday</DATE> in a report that is causing revised estimates
for congressional reapportionment.
   The Census figures on state population, issued for release
<DATE>Friday</DATE>, showed Nevadawith the biggest population gain at <PERCENT>18 percent</PERCENT>
<DATE>from 1985</DATE> to the middle of <DATE>1989</DATE>. Arizona had the second highest
growth rate, at <PERCENT>12 percent</PERCENT>, followed by <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New Hampshire</LOCATION>
at <PERCENT>11 percent</PERCENT> and <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> at <PERCENT>10 percent</PERCENT>.
   Seven states lost population during the same period, the bureau
said: <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>North Dakota</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION>.
   The population figures are closely watched at the end of each
decade because they determine how many seats in the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. House of
Representatives</ORGANIZATION> each state will have. The next reapportionment will
be based on the final <DATE>1990</DATE> Census figures, which will be collected
in the 10-year census next year.
   The report issued <DATE>Thursday</DATE> represents one last checkpoint before
that final, official count, and two forecasting groups on <DATE>Thursday</DATE>
issued revised reapportionment predictions based on the trends.
   While the two reports varied on some specifics, they agreed on
the overall trend: states in the Sunbelt will generally pick up
seats lost by states in the <LOCATION>Northeast</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Midwest</LOCATION>.
   The non-profit <ORGANIZATION>Population Reference Bureau</ORGANIZATION> said that if the
trends in <DATE>Thursday</DATE>'s report hold true through the final <DATE>1990</DATE>
figures, 11 states are likely to lose one or more seats in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>
while seven will gain.
   It said <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> will lose three seats, <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> two, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>
two, <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> two, <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION> two, <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> one, <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION> one,
<LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION> one, <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION> one, <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION> one and <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> one.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Population Reference Bureau</ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> will gain seven
seats, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> will gain three, <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> three, <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> one, <LOCATION>North
Carolina</LOCATION> one, <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION> one and <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION> one.
   The comparable prediction by <ORGANIZATION>Election Data Services Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a
Washington-based political consulting firm, differed only for a few
states. It said <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> is likely to pick up four seats, rather
than three, and it added <LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION> to the list of those losing
seats, dropping one.
   There is still a wild card in the deck which cannot, at this
point, be predicted with certainty. The <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> figures on
which the projections are based do not include members of the
military and their dependents living overseas.
   The government recently announced that they will be counted in
the <DATE>1990</DATE> reapportionment. This change could tip the balance in some
states that now appear close to winning or losing a seat.

<LEADPARA>  Final population figures for some areas released by the Census Bureau on

<TEXT>     The <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> reported <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>'s population at 2.78 million, more than
140,000 short of the figure the city submitted last fall in an official
challenge. While the final figure represented a gain of about 58,000 over
preliminary numbers released in late <DATE>summer</DATE>, <PERSON>Weed</PERSON> said the city was not
satisfied with the final count, which could mean a loss of millions of federal
dollars.;    <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> defends data;  <PERSON>Barbara Everitt Bryant</PERSON>, director of
the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION>, has defended the quality of the <DATE>1990</DATE> census, saying the
<ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> figures have in most cases proven to be more accurate than those
from the cities.;    <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>'s population figures -- for counties, towns and
cities in 18 states and the <LOCATION>District of Columbia</LOCATION> -- are part of the continuing
release of data from the <DATE>1990</DATE> census, which was conducted last <DATE>spring</DATE>. Figures
for the remaining states are scheduled to be released <DATE>today</DATE> and Friday.;   
Figures were released <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> for <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Delaware</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>District

<LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>West Virginia.</LOCATION>;    Flak from big cities;  While
thousands of local jurisdictions had challenged the preliminary findings, it
was the big cities that were most critical of the <DATE>1990</DATE> census. Even before the
census was conducted, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION> and other communities filed a
suit to force the federal government to compensate for residents missed in the
head count by using a statistical formula to arrive at new population
figures.;    As a result of that suit, the government agreed to consider such
an adjustment, and a decision will be announced by <DATE>July 15.</DATE>;    In the
meantime, complaints from cities grew even louder <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, when officials
saw that their population counts fell short of the figures they believe are
more accurate.;    <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>'s complaint;  "It's embarrassing for the government
to put forward this as a final piece of work," said <PERSON>Allan Stern</PERSON>, a city
official in <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> responsible for the census.;    While city officials
believe <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>'s population is more than 600,000, the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> published
a final count of 574,283, a gain of 20,571 over the preliminary number.;   
The statistics hold special significance in <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION>, which lost a
congressional seat in the <DATE>1990</DATE> reapportionment based on its population.;   
"We're losing a seat by 12,000 human beings," <PERSON>Stern</PERSON> said. "They're off by more
than twice that in this city alone.";    <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> sued;  In <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>, where city
officials filed a separate lawsuit in <DATE>December</DATE> challenging the census numbers,
the city's final figure prompted similar dismay.;    The Census Bureau's
figure for <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> was 394,017, a gain of 9,864 over the preliminary number.; 
  "The feeling is those figures are wrong," said <PERSON>Lyn May</PERSON>, a spokeswoman for
Mayor <PERSON>Maynard Jackson</PERSON>. She said the city would pursue its lawsuit.;    The
city believes its population is 437,000. "We stand by those numbers," <DATE>May</DATE>
said.;    This is the first time the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> has released detailed
population figures for the whole nation this early in the census reporting
process. Normally, population counts for localities are released one state at
a time over a period of many months.  </TEXT>

   The political outlook may have improved a bit
for the North in new Census population estimates.
   The South and West will wrest away some seats in the <ORGANIZATION>House of
Representatives</ORGANIZATION> after the <DATE>1990</DATE> national head count _ but maybe not
as many as had originally been thought.
   The Constitution requires seats in the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> to be redistributed
among states after each census.
   The private <ORGANIZATION>Population Reference Bureau</ORGANIZATION> analyzed a complex
series of new Census estimates on <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, and predicted that 14
<ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> seats will move from the <LOCATION>Northeast</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Midwest</LOCATION> to the South
and West after the census.
   Earlier analyses by the same group had indicated as many as 18
seats would move.
   The Census estimates include four sets of possible state
populations for <DATE>1990</DATE>, each differing slightly depending on the
amount of interstate movement by people.
   One set included no movement, and was discounted by the private
analysis group.
   But while reapportionment calculations based on the other three
varied slightly, the overall shift in seats was consistent.
   The big winner will be <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, gaining six seats based on
the new figures. The previous calculations had called for
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION> to gain five seats.
   <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> will gain three seats each, the new estimates
indicate. Earlier calculations had shown <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> adding four seats
and <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> three.
   <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION>, which had previously been expected to gain
two seats apiece, are now expected to add one, the new study said.
   <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> also will gain one, as had been expected. <LOCATION>North
Carolina</LOCATION> would add one seat under two of the estimates, but would
remain unchanged under the third.
   On the losing side, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> is still expected to lose three
seats. <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>, which had been expected to drop three, now
appears likely to lose just two. <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Illinois</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> will
drop two each, the same as previously expected.
   Also unchanged are losses of one seat each by <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION>.
   <LOCATION>Wisconsin</LOCATION>, which had been expected to lose a seat, would not do
so under the new figures. And <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> would lose a seat under two
estimates but not under the third.
   Following the <DATE>1990</DATE> census, the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> will present the
<ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> with the final state population figures and the new
reapportionment numbers.

   The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> population stood at 249,632,692 as of
the <DATE>1990</DATE> census, the government said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> in a numerical
portrait of a nation growing far more rapidly in the Sun Belt than
in the industrial north and agricultural heartland.
   <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, the nation's largest state, added more than 6
million people in the decade, a <PERCENT>26.1 percent</PERCENT> increase to 29,839,250
people.
   Wyoming remained the smallest state, with 455,975 people, down
<PERCENT>2.9 percent</PERCENT> from <DATE>1980</DATE>.
   <LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION> was the biggest population gainer in percentage terms,
and <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION> each grew by more than one-third as
millions of Americans flocked to the sunshine.
   <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION> was the largest loser in percentage terms.
   In all, the population increased by <PERCENT>10.2 percent</PERCENT> from the
226,504,825 people counted in the <DATE>1980</DATE> census, below the <PERCENT>11.4
percent</PERCENT> population growth recorded from <DATE>1970 to 1980</DATE>, and the <PERCENT>13.4
percent</PERCENT> rate from <DATE>1960</DATE> to <DATE>1970</DATE>.
   The information was contained in the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION>'s first
release of ``final figures'' - really tentative final figures -
from the <DATE>1990</DATE> count. The information will be used for everything
from readjusting the size of each state's congressional delegation
to parcelling out federal aid.
   In political terms, the population shifts will give <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>
seven new <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> seats, and add lawmakers to seven other states.
Thirteen states will lose representation.
   Because of the importance of the population estimates, some
states and cities are likely to challenge the tallies, and a final
count isn't expected until next <DATE>summer</DATE>.
   The cost of the <DATE>1990</DATE> census, from planning begun in <DATE>1984</DATE> to a
final release of data in <DATE>1993</DATE>, is estimated at <MONEY>$2.6 billion</MONEY> by the
bureau.
   Still locked in <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> computers - to be doled out over
the next several years - is a wealth of information about age,
race, living conditions and other details of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> near the turn
of the century.
   Besides <LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION>, four other states lost population. The biggest
percentage loser was <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION>, whose population dropped by <PERCENT>7.6
percent</PERCENT> to 1,801,625. Other states losing population were <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>,
down <PERCENT>4.3 percent</PERCENT>, and and <LOCATION>North Dakota</LOCATION>, down <PERCENT>1.7 percent</PERCENT>. The
<ORGANIZATION>District of Columbia</ORGANIZATION> also lost population, <PERCENT>4.5 percent</PERCENT>.
   The sharpest gainer in percentage terms was <LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION>. That state's
population grew by <PERCENT>50.7 percent</PERCENT> to 1,206,152. Besides <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>,
other states with gains of more than <PERCENT>25 percent</PERCENT> were <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, up
<PERCENT>33.4 percent</PERCENT>; <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>, up <PERCENT>35.3 percent</PERCENT>; and <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION>, up <PERCENT>37.4
percent</PERCENT>.
   The Pacific states were the fastest growing region, <PERCENT>23.4
percent</PERCENT>, followed by the Mountain states, <PERCENT>20.6 percent</PERCENT>, and the
<LOCATION>South Atlantic</LOCATION> states, <PERCENT>18.8 percent</PERCENT>. By contrast, the <ORGANIZATION>East North
Central</ORGANIZATION> states grew a bare <PERCENT>1.1 percent</PERCENT>, and the <LOCATION>West North Central</LOCATION>
states, <PERCENT>3.1 percent</PERCENT>.
   Some regions went against the broader trend. <LOCATION>New England</LOCATION>, which
had a boom in high-tech industry during the <DATE>1980s</DATE>, grew by <PERCENT>7.2
percent</PERCENT>. The East South Central states grew only <PERCENT>3.9 percent</PERCENT>.
   Because of the high financial and political stakes, the census
numbers and the way they were obtained are certain to draw
continued sharp scrutiny.
   More than 6,000 local governments challenged the accuracy of a
preliminary count based mainly on the <DATE>April 1</DATE> census taken by mail.
The <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> responded with a series of recounts and an ad
campaign urging people who thought they had been missed to come
forward.
   The final national population total was nearly 4 million people
more than the preliminary number released by the bureau earlier
this year.
   <ORGANIZATION>Commerce</ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON>Robert Mosbacher</PERSON> has until <DATE>July 1991</DATE>, to
decide whether to adjust the census numbers to account for a
statistically determined undercount of minorities. An adjustment
would increase political representation of areas with a high
percentage of minorities, and lower that of other areas.
   <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> will gain seven seats, giving it 52 in the 435-member
<ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> will gain four; <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, three; and <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, one seat each.
   <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> will lose three seats; <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>, two seats each; and <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION>,
one seat each.
   The <DATE>1990</DATE> census for the first time counted some Americans living
abroad. The total included 922,819 members of the armed forces,
civilian employees of the federal government and their dependents.
   The comparable numbers from 10 years earlier counted only people
living within the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>.
   The Census Bureau on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> released two sets of <DATE>1980</DATE>
numbers. The 226,504,825 figure used by the bureau for comparison
with the <DATE>1990</DATE> national total was released in <DATE>December 1980</DATE> but was
later adjusted slightly to get rid of minor problems. The adjusted
figure was 226,545,805.
   The <DATE>1990</DATE> population count was nearly 64 times the 3,929,214
counted in <DATE>1790</DATE>, the first census in the nation's history. By <DATE>1900</DATE>,
the population had reached 76,212,168.
   In <DATE>1950</DATE>, the first census after World War II, the population was
151,325,798.
   In <DATE>January</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> will begin sending information on
small areas, in some cases the size of a city block, to state
legislatures so they can begin drawing new congressional and
legislative boundaries.
   That process will be completed by <DATE>April 1</DATE>.
   The bureau will put off releasing detailed demographic data
until after the decision on adjusting the figures.

   In the politics of the future, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> will
exercise more clout than any smoke-filled room of politicians ever
did.
   <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> emerges from the <DATE>1990</DATE> census as a political behemoth,
with 52 <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> seats, a population bigger than <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>'s and <PERCENT>20
percent</PERCENT> of the electoral votes needed to be elected president.
   Add together the congressional representation of 21 states and
they still will total fewer than the delegation from <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>,
which swells by seven in <DATE>1992</DATE>, the result of a <PERCENT>26 percent</PERCENT> surge in
population in the <DATE>last 10 years</DATE>.
   The news is nothing but promising for Republicans. <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>
hasn't voted for a Democratic presidential candidate since <DATE>1964</DATE>;
except for <PERSON>Jimmy Carter</PERSON> in <DATE>1976</DATE>, no one has won the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION>
while losing <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> since <DATE>1912</DATE>, when Democrat <PERSON>Woodrow Wilson</PERSON>
lost the state but defeated <PERSON>Bull Mooser Theodore Roosevelt</PERSON> and
Republican <PERSON>William Howard Taft</PERSON> anyway.
   Republicans can find more cheer in most of the other shifts in
political power ordered up by the population figures released by
the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
   The industrial <ORGANIZATION>Northeast</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Midwest</LOCATION> will lose standing in
<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> and the electoral college. The West, the South and the Sun
Belt, increasingly Republican, gain.
   ``The political consequences advantage the Republicans,'' summed
up <PERSON>Stephen Hess</PERSON>, political analyst at the <ORGANIZATION>Brookings Institution</ORGANIZATION>, a
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> research organization.
   The census sets the stage, as well, for brutal redistricting
battles from coast to coast, promising to generate nasty
colleague-versus-colleague races in some of the 13 states where the
number of <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> seats must shrink.
   <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> will suffer the biggest loss, three seats, and on the
streets of <LOCATION>Brooklyn</LOCATION>, that could come down to a brawl between two
Democratic incumbents, Reps. <PERSON>Charles Schumer</PERSON> and <PERSON>Stephen Solarz</PERSON>.
They may have to compete for a single seat.
   It is no coincidence, <PERSON>Hess</PERSON> observed, that <PERSON>Schumer</PERSON> and <PERSON>Solarz</PERSON>
have built up campaign warchests in the million-dollar range, each
anticipating a costly battle - or perhaps a race elsewhere, maybe
taking on Republican <PERSON>Alfonse M. D'Amato</PERSON> for his <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> seat.
   Four states lose two <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> members - <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>, going to 20;
<LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>, to 16; <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, to 19; and <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>, to 21.
   Eight states will lose one each - <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>, down to five; <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION>, to
four; <LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION>, to six; <LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION>, to seven; <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION>, to 10;
<LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>, to one; <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION>, to 13; and <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION>, to three.
   Among the gainers are <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, up four to 23, and <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> up three
to 30. And one additional seat in the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> will go to five states
- <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>, going to six; <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION>, to 11; <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION>, to 12;
<LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION>, to 11; and <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, to nine.
   But it is <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> where the gains are most dramatic. In
<DATE>January 1993</DATE>, that state will have more representatives than 21
other states combined - <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Delaware</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>North Dakota</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>South Dakota</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Vermont</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New
Hampshire</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Rhode Island</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New Mexico</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION>.
   All states except the six which now have only one representative
- <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Delaware</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>North Dakota</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>South Dakota</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Vermont</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION>
- will have to redraw congressional boundaries. The purpose is to
give each representative 572,466 constituents, or as close to that
figure as possible.
   The cry of gerrymandering - rigging election lines to favor one
party - is sure to be heard. In <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, the election of
Republican <PERSON>Pete Wilson</PERSON> as governor will serve as a check if the
Democratic legislature tries to squeeze out Republicans, already
outnumbered 27-18.
   Elsewhere, black leaders in <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> have served notice that
they want the new lines drawn to create districts where blacks have
substantial majorities and a chance to elect a member of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``We will oppose any friend or fight any foe to ensure that
there is a black congressional district in <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> in <DATE>1991</DATE>,'' <PERSON>Jack
Gravely</PERSON>, president of that state's <ORGANIZATION>NAACP</ORGANIZATION>, announced last fall.
   <PERSON>Curtis Gans</PERSON>, director of the non-partisan <ORGANIZATION>Committee</ORGANIZATION> for the
Study of the <ORGANIZATION>American Electorate</ORGANIZATION>, disputed what he said was the
widespread view of the census figures as a ``windfall for the
Republicans.''
   Most states that picked up new seats did so because of growing
Hispanic populations, <PERSON>Gans</PERSON> said, and he predicted that Hispanics
will become increasingly loyal Democrats.
   ``Hispanics of the class that is expanding the population in
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New Mexico</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION> tend to vote 2-1
Democratic,'' he said. ``Eventually that's going to tell - probably
within the next decade.''
   Only in <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, where Cuban-Americans favor conservative
candidates, can the Republicans anticipate long-term gains, he
said.

      Americans on the Move
   Are on the Rebound
   EVERY few years, Americans stuff their worldly goods into cardboard boxes and change homes. 
From the end of World War II until the <DATE>1970s</DATE>, annually about <PERCENT>20%</PERCENT> of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> population changed residences. 

   During the <DATE>1970s</DATE> and early <DATE>1980s</DATE>, however, the "geographic mobility rate" drifted as low as <PERCENT>16%</PERCENT>, the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> says. 
Bureau demographers believe that rising housing costs, especially high interest rates, made lots of people postpone moves, the bulk of which are local and tend to be more discretionary than long-distance ones. 

   Newly released figures show American mobility snapping back to more traditional levels, with <PERCENT>20.2%</PERCENT> of the population moving in <DATE>1985</DATE>, compared with <PERCENT>17.3%</PERCENT> a year earlier. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION>, which has been charting household moves since <DATE>1948</DATE>, finds the year-to-year increase of three percentage points "unprecedented," says <PERSON>Larry Long</PERSON>, of the bureau's <ORGANIZATION>Center for Demographic Studies</ORGANIZATION>. 
The mobility rise followed a sharp drop in mortgage rates from unusually high levels. 
<PERSON>Mr. Long</PERSON> speculates that many potential movers were simply waiting for housing to become more affordable. 

   Long-distance moves in <DATE>1984-85</DATE> marked the first time in several decades that the South didn't score a big population gain. 
Some 1.3 million people moved into Southern states, but nearly as many, 1.2 million, moved out, most to the <LOCATION>Midwest</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>West</LOCATION>. 
Census demographers say they aren't sure whether this shift in <LOCATION>Southern</LOCATION> net migration is a one-year statistical aberration or the start of a significant trend. 

   Shift to the Sun
   Belt For Congressional Seats
   POLITICIANS are starting to speculate how the population drift toward the Sun Belt during the <DATE>1980s</DATE> will alter the balance of power in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>. 
If state population trends continue as they have so far this decade, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> would gain six seats in the <ORGANIZATION>House of Representatives</ORGANIZATION> in the <DATE>1990s</DATE>. 
Two other Sun Belt states with prospective big gains in <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> seats are <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, with four, and <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, with three. 
<LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> each would add one seat. 

   The rejiggering of <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> membership comes in <DATE>1991</DATE>, when states redraw congressional and legislative district lines based on the <DATE>1990</DATE> census. 
<ORGANIZATION>Since House</ORGANIZATION> membership is a permanent 435, states that saw an exodus of people in the <DATE>1980s</DATE> will lose seats to states where population grew. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Election Data Services Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a political consulting firm in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, has figured the size of each state's delegation in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> in the <DATE>1990s</DATE>, using <DATE>1986</DATE> Census Bureau population totals. 
The big losers are in the Frost Belt: <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> would drop three <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> seats, and <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> two each. 
<LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Wisconsin</LOCATION> would lose one seat apiece. 

   Ride-Sharing Incentives
   To Cut Los Angeles Smog
   MANY communities encourage voluntary car-pooling. 
In the smog-choked <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> area, that encouragement is soon to be the law. 
By next <DATE>Jan. 1</DATE>, companies with more than 500 workers in a four-county area in and around <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> must offer tangible rewards aimed at persuading employees who normally drive to work alone to join car pools or to ride buses or bicycles. 
Possible lures: cash bonuses, free gasoline, bus passes, choice parking spots in the company lot, and showers for bikers. 

   By <DATE>1990</DATE>, the policy will cover companies with more than 100 workers in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, Orange, and Riverside counties and the urban areas of <LOCATION>San Bernardino County</LOCATION>. 
That's roughly 8,000 employers with 1.5 million workers, or <PERCENT>40%</PERCENT> of the area's commuters. 

   The ride-sharing rules, supported by most businesses as a cost-effective way to reduce both smog and rush-hour bottlenecks, are the strictest adopted so far in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, according to the <ORGANIZATION>Environmental Protection Agency</ORGANIZATION>. 
The agency sees the plan as a potential model for communities elsewhere troubled with pollution or traffic congestion. 

   Enforcing the strategy is the <ORGANIZATION>South Coast Air Quality Management District</ORGANIZATION>, which was given expanded powers by the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> legislature last year to deal with smog in the <LOCATION>Los Angeles Basin</LOCATION>, the nation's No. 1 air pollution problem. 
Companies have broad discretion in crafting incentives, but the air quality district will rule on each firm's plan and audit the firm for compliance. 

   Workers aren't required to accept the incentives, but companies are required to file a plan. 
"Our experience is that when incentives are offered, people reconsider their commuting options," says <PERSON>Thomas Eichhorn</PERSON>, the district's spokesman. 

   Helping Small Businesses
   Trade in Foreign Markets
   EXPORTING is standard fare for big manufacturers like <ORGANIZATION>Boeing</ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION>Caterpillar</ORGANIZATION>, but for a smaller outfit in, say, <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, plunging into foreign trade with its letters of credit and exchange-rate exposure may be daunting. 
Finding a commercial bank to arrange and finance a trade deal of less than <MONEY>$1 million</MONEY> can also be tough. 

   The <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Export-Import Bank</ORGANIZATION> is trying to ease the pain with one-year pilot programs in three states -- <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Maryland</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> -- and three cities -- <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Tucson</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ariz</LOCATION>. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Ex-Im Bank</ORGANIZATION> provides a specialist to lead would-be exporters through the paperwork maze involved in loans to foreign buyers and working-capital guarantees. 
The states and cities support the project with money and professional services. 

   Says <PERSON>Raymond Lorello</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>'s development director: "Our argument is that the <MONEY>$100,000</MONEY> deal today may grow into the <MONEY>$1 million</MONEY> deal tomorrow."

<HEAD>Hispanic Population Booms, Census Reports</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hispanics flooded into <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> and accounted for about one-fourth of the nation's total
population growth in the <DATE>first half of this decade</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>Census
Bureau</ORGANIZATION> reports.
   Those states and <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> each now have more than 1 million
Hispanics, the bureau said in its first detailed analysis of
minority populations since the <DATE>1980</DATE> census.
   Sixteen states, led by <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, had more than 1 million blacks
as of <DATE>1985</DATE>, while <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> had the most Hispanics and other
minorities, the study found.
   Blacks comprise the nation's largest minority at 28.9 million,
the study reported. <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> had the largest black population at 2.7
million, followed by <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> with 2.1 million blacks.
   But the black population of <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> was growing faster, adding
243,000 between <DATE>1980</DATE> and <DATE>1985</DATE>, compared to a 219,000 increase for
the <ORGANIZATION>Empire State</ORGANIZATION>.
   The nation's Hispanic population jumped from 14.3 million in <DATE>1980</DATE>
to <MONEY>17.5 million</MONEY> in <DATE>1985</DATE> through a combination of high birth rates
and international migration. Although they were only <PERCENT>6.3 percent</PERCENT> of
the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> population in <DATE>1980</DATE>, Hispanics made up about one-fourth of
the 12 million national population increase during the next
half-decade, the report said.
   <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> has the largest Hispanic population, the report
showed, at 5.9 million _ one-third of all Hispanics in the nation.
   <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> was second at 3.7 million followed by <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> at 1.9
million and <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> with 1.1 million.
   <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> added 1.3 million Hispanics between <DATE>1980</DATE> and <DATE>1985</DATE>,
while <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> gained 700,000. <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION> also
added more than 100,000 Hispanics each.
   Among states with a million or more blacks the fastest growth
rate for that group, <PERCENT>16 percent</PERCENT>, was posted by <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>.
   <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION> had the largest proportion of blacks in its
population, <PERCENT>36 percent</PERCENT>, the report found, followed by <LOCATION>South
Carolina</LOCATION>, <PERCENT>31 percent</PERCENT>, and <LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION>, <PERCENT>30 percent</PERCENT>.
   During the <DATE>first half of this decade</DATE> only <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION> and the
<ORGANIZATION>District of Columbia</ORGANIZATION> had a decline in black population.
   More than four out of five blacks reside in metropolitan areas,
the bureau found. And the shift continued to be in favor of cities
with blacks migrating out of rural southern regions and into urban
areas.
   The report added that four metropolitan areas have more than 1
million black residents _ <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> (3.2 million), <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> (1.6
million), <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> (1.2 million) and <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> (1.1 million).
   Almost <PERCENT>90 percent</PERCENT> of all Hispanics live in metropolitan areas,

   Democrats bolstered their huge redistricting
advantage by adding two big prizes - <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> - to the
list of states where they hold a lock on redrawing political lines
for the next decade.
   Besides taking the governorships in those two states -
considered key because together they stand to gain seven <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> House
seats - Democrats added <LOCATION>Rhode Island</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New Mexico</LOCATION> to
their remapping monopolies on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
   Republicans won a crucial redistricting battle by taking the
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION> governor's race. The <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> needed it to keep a role in
drawing lines for the seven new <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> seats <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> is expected
to gain, because Democrats easily retained control of the
<ORGANIZATION>Legislature</ORGANIZATION>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> also scored victories by winning the <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>
governorships, but Democrats clearly will have the national edge on
the process of reapportioning the 19 <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> seats that will change
hands due to population shifts of the <DATE>1980s</DATE>.
   Advantages won <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> should help cement Democrats as the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION>
majority party for at least another decade. Democrats also said the
<LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> wins would boost their <DATE>1992</DATE> presidential hopes.
   ``We feel better about the prospects of fair districts when the
pen is in Democratic hands,'' said <PERSON>Paul Tully</PERSON>, political director
for the <ORGANIZATION>Democratic National Committee</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``These are not only net victories but victories in places that
because of their population growth will grow more important to the
future of this country and also to the presidential race,'' <PERSON>Tully</PERSON>
said.
   According to preliminary <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> figures, eight states
will gain and 13 will lose seats when <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> districts are
reapportioned next year. Democrats will control the process
outright in at least five of the states gaining <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> seats.
   Despite the anti-incumbent mood thought to be sweeping the
country, voters appeared unwilling to turn out their state
legislators. Millions of dollars were spent on legislative races
this year due to their importance in the redistricting picture, but
few chambers changed hands.
   The <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> turned back Democratic efforts to take over the senates
of <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>. Redistricting power will be
shared in all three states, which will lose <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> seats in <DATE>1992</DATE>.
   ``This proves the <ORGANIZATION>Republican Party</ORGANIZATION> is alive and well despite the
doom and gloom predicted,'' said <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>'s state Senate Republican
leader, <PERSON>Ralph Marino</PERSON>.
   Democrats fended off Republican efforts to take over the state
senates in <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> and the lower chamber in
<LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> was trying to wrest control of the <ORGANIZATION>Oregon
House</ORGANIZATION> from Democrats, too.
   <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>'s gubernatorial race was up for grabs, as the lead
seesawed throughout <ORGANIZATION>Election Night</ORGANIZATION>.
   Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> lost the <ORGANIZATION>Indiana House</ORGANIZATION>, but Republicans kept
control of the state <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>. Democrats captured control of the
state <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>. A Democratic effort to gain control of the
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> state <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> hinged on absentee ballots in two
neck-and-neck races.
   In <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>, Republicans kept control of the state <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>.
   By losing in the governorships in <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION>
lost its say in how political maps will be drawn for those ne
<ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> seats.
   Similar gubernatorial wins in <LOCATION>Rhode Island</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New
Mexico</LOCATION> gave Democrats absolute control there, too. The <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION>
delegations in those states won't change, but Democrats can aim to
draw districts that protect their <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> incumbents and perhaps
endanger GOP lawmakers. The political lines for state seats are at
stake as well.
   Another victory for Democrats came in <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION>, where they ousted
a Republican governor and gained control of the state <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION>. Kansas
will lose one <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> seat.
   Election Day began with Democrats controlling 69 of the nation's
99 legislative chambers, and that margin was on track to change
little.
   More than 6,100 legislative races were decided across the
country, but the focus of national party organizations was about 50
races in 10 states in which chambers were held by narrow
majorities.
   The Democrats were in position to draw districts that in <DATE>1992</DATE>
could pad their <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> majority, now at 258-175 with two vacancies,
by a dozen seats or more beyoe <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
   The other five <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> seats are expected to go to <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>North
Carolina</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>. Democrats already had a
redistricting monopoly in <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> and kept their sole control in
<LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION>. A nonpartisnd the gains madan commission draws
the map
in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>.
   Among the 13 states losing seats, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> will suffer the most
- giving up three.
   <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION> are to lose two seats
each. Losing one will be <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>.

      High-School Enrollment
   Has Its <ORGANIZATION>Ups</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Downs
   WEST VIRGINIA</ORGANIZATION> might consider adding the high school student to its list of endangered species. 
A survey released this month of projected enrollments estimates that the state's high schools will graduate nearly a third fewer students by the year <DATE>2004</DATE>. 

   High-school enrollment nationwide has been on a roller-coaster ride, giving school planners fits. 
The number of high-school graduates peaked in <DATE>1979</DATE>, declined through the mid-1980s, and turned up slightly the past couple of years. 
Another major slump is expected in <DATE>1989</DATE> but will bottom out in the mid-1990s and then recover strongly just past the year <DATE>2000</DATE>. 
The ups and downs reflect fluctuations in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> birth rate and the influx of immigrant groups who favor large families. 

   The study by the <ORGANIZATION>Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Boulder</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Colo.</LOCATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION>College Board</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, relies on population trends but doesn't try to forecast state economic conditions, which can cause sharp population swings. 

   The study says <LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION>'s high-school graduates will more than double by <DATE>2004</DATE>. 
Graduates in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> will increase by nearly two-thirds. 
<LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION> face sharply fewer graduates.

   If You Can't Beat Them,
   Change the Rules
   <LOCATION>CARBONDALE</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>ILL.</LOCATION>, news paper publisher <PERSON>W. Stephen Burgess</PERSON> says: "If you aren't in those books, you don't exist."
   He's speaking of the bibles of the advertising, media and sales industries -- such as Newspaper Rates and Data, and Survey of Buying Power -- that list income and demographic data for metropolitan areas. Because <LOCATION>Carbondale</LOCATION> doesn't meet the complex federal definition of a metro area, it isn't on these lists. And as a result, <PERSON>Mr. Burgess</PERSON> says, his newspaper, the <ORGANIZATION>Southern Illinoisan</ORGANIZATION>, has a tough time catching the attention of national advertisers.
   The solution? Become a metro area by act of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>. At the behest of the city's boosters, Rep. <PERSON>Kenneth Gray</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Ill.</LOCATION>) introduced a bill naming the county that includes <LOCATION>Carbondale</LOCATION> and two adjacent counties as one Metropolitan Statistical Area. Though <LOCATION>Carbondale</LOCATION> has just 26,000 residents -- including 12,000 <ORGANIZATION>Southern Illinois University</ORGANIZATION> students -- the combined counties have more than 100,000 residents, one of the benchmarks of a metro area.
   Two other areas, <LOCATION>Harvey County</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kan.</LOCATION>, and a two-county region including <LOCATION>Decatur</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ala.</LOCATION>, have achieved the status by congressional fiat since <DATE>1986</DATE>. The tinkering disturbs statisticians, though, who say it makes all metro area figures suspect.
   If the <LOCATION>Carbondale</LOCATION> bill is approved, it could be a shallow victory. Survey of Buying Power, a widely used sales and media guide, will stop listing metro areas that don't meet the government's traditional definition. "We're seeing statistics used in an improper way for private gain. It's a subtle form of pork barrel," says <PERSON>Edward Spar</PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION>Bill Communications</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, the survey's publisher.
   Census Won't List
   Various Asian Groups
   <LOCATION>CALIFORNIA</LOCATION> congressman <PERSON>Robert Matsui</PERSON> appears to have lost a battle with the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> over how the nation's fast-growing Asian population will be counted.
   Rep. <PERSON>Matsui</PERSON> wants the <DATE>1990</DATE> census form's question on racial identity to contain a list of at least 11 Asian groups: Japanese, Korean, <LOCATION>Hawaiian</LOCATION>, Chinese and Samoan, for instance. Ethnic Asians would be asked to check one of the categories, or an additional line marked "other." A similar question was on the <DATE>1980</DATE> census.
   But the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION>, citing space problems, has decided on a single fill-in-the-blank question, requiring Asians and <ORGANIZATION>Pacific Islanders</ORGANIZATION> to write in their ethnic identification. <PERSON>Paula Schneider</PERSON>, chief of the bureau's population division, says that in several field tests the write-in question resulted in more accurate data than the check-off method. Rep. <PERSON>Matsui</PERSON>, however, says many immigrants with poor English skills won't fill in the blank correctly.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Office of Management and Budget</ORGANIZATION> -- which has final say on census matters, barring congressional override -- is expected to side with the bureau.
   As a compromise, though, <PERSON>Ms. Schneider</PERSON> says the <DATE>1990</DATE> census will include far more detailed information on Asian groups than previous censuses, and the figures will be rushed out by the <DATE>spring of 1991</DATE>. After the <DATE>1980</DATE> census, it took until the mid-1980s before all the data on Asians were released.
   Odds and Ends
   SUN BELT inflation: <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>'s purchasing managers report that the rate of price increases last month was the state's second highest for any month in the past seven years. . . . So far this year, the <ORGANIZATION>Centers for Disease Control</ORGANIZATION> has identified 192 animal rabies cases in <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Maryland</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> -- making it the region with the highest incidence of rabies in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> . . . High-density bureaucrats: <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION> have more than 600 federal, state and local government employees per 10,000 population, the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> says.

<HEAD>With the House At Stake, Computers and Lawyers Are Ready for Redistricting</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Armed with batteries of computers and brigades
of lawyers, Republicans and Democrats are skirmishing for control
of the political shakeup that offers the <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> its once-in-a-decade
opportunity to dent Democratic control of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``If we want to be competitive in the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION>, we have to get a
good shake on redistricting,'' said <PERSON>Charles Black</PERSON>, the political
consultant who is chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>Republican National Committee</ORGANIZATION>'s
advisory committee on redistricting.
   ``Right now, given the strength of incumbency, there are only
two times you get a chance to pick up any congressional seats,'' he
said. ``One is when the seats are open, and two is when you redraw
the lines.''
   For Republicans, redistricting is a chance to break out of their
depressing status as a seemingly permanent minority in the <ORGANIZATION>U.S.
House</ORGANIZATION>.
   Democrats control the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> by a margin of 260 to 175. While
voters in recent presidential elections have preferred Republican
candidates by landslide margins, Democrats now hold 18 more <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION>
seats than they did when <PERSON>Ronald Reagan</PERSON> was inaugurated in <DATE>1981</DATE>.
   Democrats claim the capital's political split personality comes
from voters' desire to have <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> act as a balance to <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION>
presidents. Republicans claim the split is rooted the Democrats'
drawing the lines for most current congressional districts.
   Redistricting is the once-a-decade reshuffling of the nation's
congressional districts. It is a three-pronged battle _ technical,
political, and legal.
   Every 10 years, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Census counts everyone living in the
country. This time, the day for the count is <DATE>April 1, 1990</DATE>.
   For politicians, the most important Census information is not
how many Americans there are, but where they live. For while the
population increases, the size of the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. House</ORGANIZATION> remains at 435
voting members.
   By <DATE>Dec. 31, 1990</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> will announce each state's
population. And the bureau will reveal the reapportionment of the
<ORGANIZATION>U.S. House</ORGANIZATION> _ the number of representatives for each state, based on
a complicated mathematical formula.
   Then comes redistricting at the state level _ redrawing the
boundaries of congressional districts to fit the new population.
   Gone are the days when cigar-chomping politicians matched up
Census data with voting lists and redrew lines to help their
friends and punish their enemies.
   They're still helping their friends and punishing their enemies,
but now the politicians do it with computers that produce highly
sophisticated plans to can do in a legislator with subtle shifts of
city blocks.
   But computers have little value to politicians who don't have
the votes to get their plan adopted.
   The two parties are considered on a par technologically, but the
Democrats control 28 state legislatures, while Republicans have
only 8. In 13 states Republicans control one legislative chamber
and Democrats the other. <LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION> has a unicameral nonpartisan
legislature.
   The other key players are governors _ 28 are Democrats, while 22
are Republicans.
   Elections this year and next will determine who controls
redistricting. In the states expected to gain or lose the most
seats, neither party is in control, promising fierce battles for
governor and legislative seats.
   The <DATE>1990</DATE> Census will certify the shift to the Sunbelt that will
have <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> speaking with a decidedly more <ORGANIZATION>Southern and Western</ORGANIZATION>
accent. Based on current estimates, 17 <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> seats will head South
and <LOCATION>West</LOCATION>.
   <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> will be the big winner, gaining six seats with an
outside chance of picking up seven. With 45 members in the current
<ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> already has by far the largest congressional
delegation.
   Other winners are <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, expected to gain four <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> seats,
and <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, likely to pick up three. Likely to gain one each are
<LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION>.
   The losers are a familiar lineup _ mostly Northern industrial
states that have seen their congressional representation erode in
recent decades.
   If current trends hold, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> will lose three seats and
<LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION> two each. Losing one each
would be <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Wisconsin</LOCATION>.
   With redistricting clout in the balance, the high-profile races
for governor are in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION> _ all
of which are now in <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> hands. But <PERSON>George Deukmejian</PERSON> of <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>
and <PERSON>Bill Clements</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> are not running for re-election and <PERSON>Bob
Martinez</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> is regarded as vulnerable. <PERSON>Jim Thompson</PERSON> of
<LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION> hasn't announced yet whether he will seek a fifth term as
governor.
   In addition, the battle for control will be fought in countless
legislative contests.
   For example, in <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>, Democrats would control the process if
they capture the state senate where Republicans have a narrow
majority. In <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>, Republicans control one chamber by four
seats and Democrats the other by three.
   After the politicians draw the district lines, the battle will
move to another arena, the courts.
   At some point in the <DATE>1980</DATE> process, redistricting plans in all
but three states ended up in court, says <PERSON>Kimball Brace</PERSON>, president
of <ORGANIZATION>Election Data Services</ORGANIZATION>, a consulting firm that works on
redistricting for Democrats.
   Thus Republicans and Democrats are recruiting teams of lawyers
to defend their plans or attack the opposition's in federal and
state courts.
   The guiding legal principle stems from the <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION>'s ``one
man, one vote'' ruling that mandated that legislative districts be
substantially equal in population.
   Brace cited a <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> plan that ended up in court. Republicans
offered a plan with congressional districts differing in population
by no more than four people. But the court ruled in favor of the
Democrats' plan which was drawn with each district identical in
population.
   How long do districts remain identical in population? Probably
not more than a day or two after the Census is taken.

   <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> has supplanted <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> as the fourth most-populous state, ranking behind <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> said. 

   The <ORGANIZATION>Commerce Department</ORGANIZATION> bureau put the overall estimated <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> population as of <DATE>July 1</DATE> at 243.4 million people, up from nearly 241.1 million in mid-1986 and 226.5 million in the <DATE>1980</DATE> census. 

   The latest estimates showed that <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>'s population has grown by 2.3 million people, or <PERCENT>23%</PERCENT>, since <DATE>1980</DATE> when it ranked seventh. 

   <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> now ranks fifth, followed in order by <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> said. 

   Meanwhile, <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION>, the least-populous state at the time of the <DATE>1980</DATE> census, is now second-smallest with an estimated population of 525,000. 
Wyoming ranks last with a population of 490,000. 

   Population losses continued in the past year in five farm states -- <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>North Dakota</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION>. 

   Energy-depressed states, including <LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION>, also showed losses, and <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> grew far more slowly than earlier in the decade, the agency said. 

   The new figures are only estimates. 
The government will conduct a fullfledged census in <DATE>1990</DATE>.

<TEXT>
   Democrats on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> padded their overwhelming
control of political redistricting, plucking the potent <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> governorships from <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> hands and adding <LOCATION>Rhode Island</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New Mexico</LOCATION> to their remapping monopolies.
   The <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> defeats were disastrous for Republicans,
and Democrats were in the running for the only remaining major GOP
redistricting weapon - the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> governorship.
   Democrats clearly will have a huge edge when lines are drawn for
<DATE>1992</DATE> congressional races, all but cementing the Republicans as the
<ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> minority for another decade and perhaps far longer. And
Democrats were calling the <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> victories a boost for
their <DATE>1992</DATE> presidential hopes.
   ``We feel better about the prospects of fair districts when the
pen is in Democratic hands,'' said <ORGANIZATION>Democratic National Committee</ORGANIZATION>
political director <PERSON>Paul Tully</PERSON>. ``These are not only net victories
but victories in places that because of their population growth
will grow more important to the future of this country and also to
the presidential race.''
   In all, eight states will gain and 13 will lose seats when <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION>
districts are reapportioned to reflect population shifts of the
<DATE>1980s</DATE>, according to preliminary census data. Democrats will control
the process outright in at least five of the states gaining <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION>
seats.
   The <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> governorship was the only significant redistricting
victory for Republicans as results from gubernatorial and
legislative races trickled in. So frustrating was the <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION>'s night
that the only redistricting monopoly the <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> gained was in <LOCATION>Vermont</LOCATION>
- which has only one <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> seat anyway.
   Despite the millions spent on oft-ignored state races with the
post-Census redistricting in mind, it appeared but a few of the
dozen targeted chambers would change hands.
   The <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> turned back Democratic efforts to take over the <LOCATION>New
York</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Ohio Senates</ORGANIZATION>. Redistricting power in all
three states, which will lose <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> seats in <DATE>1992</DATE>, will be shared.
   Republicans failed in their bid to wrest the <ORGANIZATION>Illinois Senate</ORGANIZATION>
from Democrats but won a close governor's race to keep a say in
redistricting there. The <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> was trailing in bids to win over the
<ORGANIZATION>Democratic Florida Senate</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Pennsylvania House</ORGANIZATION>. Early returns
showed control of the <ORGANIZATION>Oregon House</ORGANIZATION> within reach.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Indiana House</ORGANIZATION> was likely to go from <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> hands to the
Democrats. Other Democratic targets were the state senates in
<LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> and both chambers in <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> suffered a big loss when Democrat <PERSON>Lawton Chiles</PERSON> unseated
<LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>'s Republican governor, and things would only get worse.
   The <LOCATION>Rhode Island</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New Mexico</LOCATION> governor's offices
went from Republican to Democratic hands and then <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> was seized
by the Democrats too.
   Democrats now will have sole power over the remapping in those
states. <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> is likely to gain four <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> seats and <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> three.
The <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> delegations in <LOCATION>Rhode Island</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New Mexico</LOCATION>
won't change, but control of redistricting should allow Democrats
to draw districts that protect their <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> incumbents and perhaps
endanger GOP lawmakers.
   Another victory for Democrats came in <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION>, where by unseating
a Republican governor the party went from being shut out of the
process to having veto power in redistricting. Kansas will lose one
<ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> seat.
   The Republicans' last hope was <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, which will get seven
of the 19 shifting seats. But even with a win in the governor's
race there the <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> would only share the power with the Democratic
legislature.
   Democrats, with huge majorities in many legislative chambers,
were virtually assured a redistricting voice in all the
battleground states even before the polls opened <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
   The day began with Democrats controlling 69 of the nation's 99
legislative chambers and 29 of the 50 governorships.
   More than 6,100 legislative races were decided across the
country, but the focus of national party organizations was about 50
races in 10 states in which chambers are held by narrow majorities.
   Even with <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> undecided, the Democrats were in position
to draw districts that in <DATE>1992</DATE> likely would pad their majority in
the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION>, now at 258-175, by a dozen seats or more beyond whatever
gains they made in <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>'s elections.
   Preliminary census data suggest the remaining five <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> seats
that shift will go to <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>
and <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>. Among those states, redistricting control was a
serious question only in <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>. Democrats already had a
redistricting monopoly in <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> and kept hold of their sole
control in <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION>. A nonpartisan commission
draws the map in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>.
   Democrats were facing uphill odds in their effort to erase the
<ORGANIZATION>Arizona GOP</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>17-13 Senate</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>34-26 House</ORGANIZATION> majorities. But Democrat
<PERSON>Terry Goddard</PERSON> was leading in early returns in the governor's race .
If elected, he could veto any redistricting plan drawn by a
possibly Republican legislature.
   Among the 13 states losing seats, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> will suffer the most
- giving up three.
   Gov. <PERSON>Mario Cuomo</PERSON> was headed to easy re-election and the <ORGANIZATION>New York
Assembly</ORGANIZATION> had a 92-58 Democratic majority entering <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>'s voting.
Results were slow to come in, but Democrats conceded they would not
capture the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>, where they had hoped to wipe out a five-seat
Republican majority and gain a redistricting monopoly.
   <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION> are to lose two seats
each. Losing one will be <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>. Democrats control
the process in <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION>.
In <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> the power will be
shared.

   Racial Groups Diverge
   In Timing of First Births
                                                                                                       

</LP>
<TEXT>
   RACIAL differences in the timing of first births are
widening, two <ORGANIZATION>University of Pennsylvania</ORGANIZATION> demographers find.
   Drawing on birth and other records published since <DATE>1979</DATE>,
<PERSON>Renbao Chen</PERSON> and <PERSON>S. Philip Morgan</PERSON> determine that from <DATE>1980</DATE> to
<DATE>1987</DATE> white women under 30 years old continued an earlier
trend toward postponing their first birth, while white women
over 30 began showing slightly higher rates of first births
than over-30 women of earlier decades, clearly seeking to
catch up on postponed fertility. Nonwhite women -- blacks,
Asians and others -- also tended to have their first children
at somewhat later ages than nonwhite women in earlier years.
   But at every age from the teens on, blacks and other
nonwhites were far more likely to be having their first birth
than were white women of the same age. For example, in <DATE>1987</DATE> a
20-year-old nonwhite woman was almost twice as likely to have
her first child in the following year as was a 20-year-old
white woman, while a 25-year-old nonwhite woman was about 1
1/2 times more likely to be having her first child than her
white counterpart.
   The research also showed that nonwhite women now have far
lower rates of childlessness than white women. Historically,
blacks had far higher rates, due largely to health and other
involuntary factors. This situation started reversing in the
<DATE>1950s</DATE>, and the difference has grown greater as more white
women have forgone having children altogether. In <DATE>1987</DATE>, for
instance, a white woman born in <DATE>1954</DATE> was better than three
times more likely to be childless than a 33-year-old
nonwhite.
                                                                                                       

   Farm Belt Holds Onto
   Its Oldest Americans
                                                                                                       

   THE OLDEST old, those 85 or more, bulk largest in the Farm
Belt, <DATE>1990</DATE> census figures show.
   Not surprisingly, the largest numbers of 85-plus men and
women are found in the most populous states: <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>. In each of these, people 85 and over total well
into six figures.
   Looked at as a percentage of a state's population,
however, a much different picture emerges. In 14 states, the
85-and-older group accounts for <PERCENT>1.5%</PERCENT> or more of the total
population. Iowa leads with <PERCENT>2.0%</PERCENT>, closely followed by <LOCATION>South
Dakota</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION> with <PERCENT>1.9%</PERCENT>, <LOCATION>North Dakota</LOCATION> with <PERCENT>1.8%</PERCENT> and
<LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION> with <PERCENT>1.7%</PERCENT>.
   In nine other states, including <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Wisconsin</LOCATION>, the oldest old account for
<PERCENT>1.6%</PERCENT> or <PERCENT>1.5%</PERCENT> of the total. The other states in this category
are <LOCATION>East Coast</LOCATION>: <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Rhode Island</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION>. <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION>, by contrast, is at the bottom of the ranking,
with only <PERCENT>0.2%</PERCENT> of its population 85 or older.
   Much the same states rank at or near the top in the
percentage of total state population living in nursing homes.
The <LOCATION>Dakotas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Wisconsin</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Rhode Island</LOCATION> are the only states with
at least <PERCENT>1%</PERCENT> of their populations living in nursing homes.
Census Bureau specialist <PERSON>Cynthia Taeuber</PERSON> says most nursing
home residents are 85 or older.
   So why do the oldest old figure so heavily in these
states? <PERSON>Ms. Taeuber</PERSON> hypothesizes that in most of these states
younger adults move out to seek better job opportunities,
while the older natives stay and age in place, inevitably
constituting a larger share of the total. And with their
children moved away, many end up in nursing homes.
   Another census report says that the number of
centenarians, men and women 100 or older, more than doubled
between <DATE>1980</DATE> and <DATE>1990</DATE>, increasing to 35,808 from an estimated
14,000 to 16,000. (There was no precise count in <DATE>1980</DATE>.) More
than 28,000 of the 35,808 were women, and well over 29,000 of
the total were white.
                                                                                                       

   Golf Has More Players,
   Who Play More Often
                                                                                                       

   MORE PEOPLE are playing golf, and most are playing more
often, a recreation specialist reports.
   <PERSON>Rod Warnick</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>University of Massachusetts</ORGANIZATION> professor who
tracks leisure trends, calculates that the number of adult
golfers increased about <PERCENT>6%</PERCENT> a year in the <DATE>1980s</DATE> to 22.2
million, while the number of days played grew about <PERCENT>7%</PERCENT>
annually to 393.7 million. Moreover, he notes, the number of
"heavy" golfers, those playing 20 or more times a year, grew
even faster, more than doubling to 6.8 million, while the
number of days these avid golfers played increased about <PERCENT>8%</PERCENT>
annually to almost 300 million days.
   <PERSON>Mr. Warnick</PERSON> says the growth of leisure time, the
increasing numbers of retirees and the aging of the baby
boomers all contributed. He also finds that more women and
minorities have taken up the game -- a trend he sees as apt
to lead to further anti-discrimination suits against golf
clubs and courses that aren't fully integrated or given to
equal treatment.
                                                                                                       

   Odds and Ends
                                                                                                       

   MOBILE HOMES make up <PERCENT>7%</PERCENT> of the nation's housing inventory,
the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> reports. This is the fastest-growing type
of housing, up <PERCENT>60%</PERCENT> since <DATE>1980</DATE>. . . . Athletes who play hard
to win are more apt to get hurt than those who just play for
fun, <ORGANIZATION>University of Florida</ORGANIZATION> researchers find. They say those
who take a game too much to heart are more likely to put
themselves in a risky situation in an effort to come out
ahead. . . . Diseases and other causes of disability in women
65 and older will be the subject of a seven-year study by the
<ORGANIZATION>Johns Hopkins School of Medicine</ORGANIZATION> under a contract with the
government's <ORGANIZATION>National Institute on Aging</ORGANIZATION>. About two-thirds of
all disabled older people are female.

   Population Drain Ends 

   For <LOCATION>Midwestern States 

   IOWA</LOCATION> IS MAKING a comeback. 
So are <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>. 
The population of all four states is on the upswing, according to new <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> estimates, following declines throughout the early <DATE>1980s</DATE>. 

   The gains, to be sure, are rather small. 
<LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>, for instance, saw its population grow by 11,000 people, or <PERCENT>0.4%</PERCENT>, between <DATE>1987</DATE> and <DATE>1988</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> says. 
Still, even that modest increase is good news for a state that hadn't grown at all since <DATE>1981</DATE>. 

   Between <DATE>1987</DATE> and <DATE>1988</DATE>, <LOCATION>North Dakota</LOCATION> was the only state in the <LOCATION>Midwest</LOCATION> to lose population, a loss of 4,000 people. 
Six of the 12 midwestern states have been growing steadily since <DATE>1980</DATE> -- <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>South Dakota</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Wisconsin</LOCATION>. 

   The <ORGANIZATION>Northeast</ORGANIZATION> has been holding its own in the population race. 
Seven of nine states have grown each year since <DATE>1980</DATE>, including <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, which lost <PERCENT>4%</PERCENT> of its population during the <DATE>1970s</DATE>. 
And although <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION> suffered slight declines earlier in the decade, they are growing again. 

   At the same time, several states in the <LOCATION>South and West</LOCATION> have had their own population turnaround. 
Seven states that grew in the early <DATE>1980s</DATE> are now losing population -- <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION>. 

   Overall, though, the South and West still outpace the <LOCATION>Northeast</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Midwest</LOCATION>, and fast-growing states like <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> ensure that the pattern will continue. 
But the growth gap between the Sun Belt and other regions has clearly started narrowing. 

   More Elderly Maintain 

   Their Independence 

   THANKS TO modern medicine, more couples are growing old together. 
And even after losing a spouse, more of the elderly are staying independent. 
A new <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> study of the noninstitutionalized population shows that <PERCENT>64%</PERCENT> of people aged 65 to 74 were living with a spouse in <DATE>1988</DATE>, up from <PERCENT>59%</PERCENT> in <DATE>1970</DATE>. 

   This doesn't mean they're less likely to live alone, however. 
That share has remained at about <PERCENT>24%</PERCENT> since <DATE>1970</DATE>. 
What has changed is that more of the young elderly are living with spouses rather than with other relatives, such as children. 
In <DATE>1988</DATE>, <PERCENT>10%</PERCENT> of those aged 65 to 74 lived with relatives other than spouses, down from <PERCENT>15%</PERCENT> in <DATE>1970</DATE>. 

   As people get even older, many become widowed. 
But even among those aged 75 and older, the share living with a spouse rose slightly, to <PERCENT>40%</PERCENT> in <DATE>1988</DATE> from <PERCENT>38%</PERCENT> in <DATE>1970</DATE>. 

   Like their younger counterparts, the older elderly are less likely to live with other relatives. 
Only <PERCENT>17%</PERCENT> of those aged 75 and older lived with relatives other than spouses in <DATE>1988</DATE>, down from <PERCENT>26%</PERCENT> in <DATE>1970</DATE>. 

   The likelihood of living alone beyond the age of 75 has increased to <PERCENT>40%</PERCENT> from <PERCENT>32%</PERCENT>. 
More people are remaining independent longer presumably because they are better off physically and financially. 

   Careers Count Most 

   For the Well-to-Do 

   MANY AFFLUENT people place personal success and money above family. 

   At least that's what a survey by <ORGANIZATION>Ernst &amp; Young</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Yankelovich</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Clancy</PERSON>, <PERSON>Shulman</PERSON> indicates. 
Two-thirds of respondents said they strongly felt the need to be successful in their jobs, while fewer than half said they strongly felt the need to spend more time with their families. 
Being successful in careers and spending the money they make are top priorities for this group. 

   Unlike most studies of the affluent market, this survey excluded the super-rich. 
Average household income for the sample was <MONEY>$194,000</MONEY>, and average net assets were reported as <MONEY>$775,000</MONEY>. 

   The goal was to learn about one of today's fastest-growing income groups, the upper-middle class. 
Although they represent only <PERCENT>2%</PERCENT> of the population, they control nearly one-third of discretionary income. 

   Across the board, these consumers value quality, buy what they like rather than just what they need, and appreciate products that are distinctive. 

   Despite their considerable incomes and assets, <PERCENT>40%</PERCENT> of the respondents in the study don't feel financially secure, and one-fourth don't feel that they have made it. 
Twenty percent don't even feel they are financially well off. 

   Many of the affluent aren't comfortable with themselves, either. 
About <PERCENT>40%</PERCENT> don't feel they're more able than others. 
While twothirds feel some guilt about being affluent, only <PERCENT>25%</PERCENT> give <MONEY>$2,500</MONEY> or more to charity each year. 

   Thirty-five percent attend religious services regularly; at the same time, <PERCENT>60%</PERCENT> feel that in life one sometimes has to compromise one's principles. 

   Odds and Ends 

   THE NUMBER of women and minorities who hold jobs in top management in the nation's largest banks has more than doubled since <DATE>1978</DATE>. 
The <ORGANIZATION>American Bankers Association</ORGANIZATION> says that women make up <PERCENT>47%</PERCENT> of officials and managers in the top 50 banks, up from <PERCENT>33%</PERCENT> in <DATE>1978</DATE>. 
The share of minorities in those positions has risen to <PERCENT>16%</PERCENT> from <PERCENT>12%</PERCENT>. . . . 
Per-capita personal income in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> grew faster than inflation last year, according to the <ORGANIZATION>Bureau of Economic Analysis</ORGANIZATION>. 
The amount of income divvied up for each man, woman and child was <MONEY>$16,489</MONEY> in <DATE>1988</DATE>, up <PERCENT>6.6%</PERCENT> from <MONEY>$15,472</MONEY> in <DATE>1987</DATE>. 
Per capita personal income ranged from <MONEY>$11,116</MONEY> in <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION> to <MONEY>$23,059</MONEY> in <LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION>. . . . 
There are 13.1 million students in college this <DATE>fall</DATE>, up <PERCENT>2%</PERCENT> from <DATE>1988</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>National Center for Education Statistics</ORGANIZATION> estimates. 
About <PERCENT>54%</PERCENT> are women, and <PERCENT>44%</PERCENT> are part-time students.

POPULATION BOOM BOOSTS SAN DIEGO AREA TO NO. 17 IN NATION, CENSUS BUREAU SAYS

<TEXT>
<P>
The <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> metropolitan area has added more than half-a-million residents in 
the <DATE>1980s</DATE>, representing one of the fastest growth rates nationwide, the <ORGANIZATION>Census 
Bureau</ORGANIZATION> reported <DATE>Thursday</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
The population boom has vaulted the city past <LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION> in the 
<DATE>last year</DATE>, making <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> the 17th largest metropolitan area in the country, 
according to the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION>'s annual estimates. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, the population of <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> and its suburbs rose 509,000 (<PERCENT>27.3%</PERCENT>) since 
the start of the decade, including an increase of 84,100 residents from <DATE>1987</DATE> to 
<DATE>1988</DATE>. Among large metropolitan areas, only <LOCATION>Phoenix</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> grew 
faster, with the <LOCATION>Phoenix</LOCATION> population increasing by <PERCENT>34.5%</PERCENT> since <DATE>1980</DATE>, the most in 
the nation. 
</P>
<P>
A <ORGANIZATION>San Diego Greater Chamber of Commerce</ORGANIZATION> official welcomed the news. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a confirmation that <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> is a rapidly growing area," said <PERSON>Max 
Schetter</PERSON>, the chamber's research director. "People are coming here because of 
the jobs and the things to do here, the opportunity, the strong economy." 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>'s population has been growing at <PERCENT>4%</PERCENT> annually, contrasted with <PERCENT>2%</PERCENT> for 
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION> and <PERCENT>1%</PERCENT> for the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Schetter</PERSON> said. Last year's increase, 
the highest since <DATE>1950</DATE>, was likely the largest ever in peacetime, he added. 
</P>
<P>
But <PERSON>Schetter</PERSON> also cautioned that the boom is unlikely to continue because of 
inadequate road and sewer networks, and high housing prices. "I would be 
surprised if (growth) stayed at that rate much longer," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The annual survey examined 283 metropolitan areas, each an urban region with 
its own local economy, according to <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON>Cheryl Chambers</PERSON>. 
But <PERSON>Schetter</PERSON> complained that the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION>'s count stopped at the 
international border, excluding <LOCATION>Tijuana</LOCATION> and its estimated 1.5 million residents 
from the <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> metropolitan area.

<HEAD>States Consider Laws Requiring Companies to Insure Workers</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Poor-Insurance, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is a list of some of the states considering legislation to
help workers who have no health insurance. <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION>
have laws requiring employers to insure their workers.
   _<LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION>: A bill in the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> would provide up to 10,000
uninsured people with state-subsidized health insurance. Lawmakers
also are considering a mandatory insurance bill based on
<LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION>' law.
   _<LOCATION>California</LOCATION>: Five bills have been introduced, including one
requiring companies with five or more employees to provide health
care benefits. About 2.7 million workers are uninsured, or about
one out of 10 <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> residents.
   _<LOCATION>Delaware</LOCATION>: A measure pending in a <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> committee is aimed at
providing insurance for the indigent. Between 80,000 and 90,000
people are uninsured.
   _<LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>: Legislators are considering a measure based on
<LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION>' law, requiring employers to insure their employees.
An estimated 1 million to 2 million people, or one-sixth of
<LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>'s population, are uninsured.
   _<LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION>: The <ORGANIZATION>General Assembly</ORGANIZATION> passed a measure creating a
high-risk health insurance pool that will arrange health insurance
for those who could not previously qualify for insurance. About 2
million people are uninsured.
   _<LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>: A bill would require businesses with five or more
employees to provide health benefits for employees who work more
than 17{ hours weekly. About 1.5 million Illinoisans have neither
private health insurance nor Medicaid, or more than <PERCENT>13 percent</PERCENT> of
the state's 11 million people.
   _<LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION>: The state <ORGANIZATION>General Assembly</ORGANIZATION> is considering a measure
that would create a commission to study the need for
state-sponsored health care services. <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION> has 769,000 people,
or about <PERCENT>17 percent</PERCENT> of the population, with no insurance.
   _<LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>: A bill passed by a <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> committee creates a <MONEY>$200,000</MONEY>

   Simply put, the question was who should be
counted as a person and who, if anybody, should not. But there's
nothing simple about it.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> voted one answer and, in effect, invited the <ORGANIZATION>Supreme
Court</ORGANIZATION> to decide whether it was right or wrong.
   That happened because in the arithmetic of congressional
reapportionment, every question becomes complex, contentious and
politically charged.
   The point at issue in <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> debate on a new immigration bill was
whether illegal aliens should be counted in the process that will
reallocate <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> seats among states after the <DATE>1990</DATE> census. There
could be enough of them to shift seats away from at least five
states to Sun Belt states with large numbers of illegal residents.
   Nobody is certain because counting illegal aliens is a hard thing
to do, given the fact that they don't want to be spotted by the
government. Then again, the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> maintains that not
including them, and still coming up with an accurate <DATE>1990</DATE> population
count, would be even more difficult. ``A census of only legal
residents cannot be done as accurately as a census of all
residents,'' according to <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> testimony to <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>.
   After the <DATE>1980</DATE> census, the government estimated that there were
2.57 million people in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> illegally. There were other
guesses, some of them far higher. The government made no attempt to
count them out in the redistricting process; indeed, the two
previous administrations decided that the Constitution required that
the census cover illegal aliens along with citizens.
   There is not likely to be any change in that prior to the <DATE>1990</DATE>
census next <DATE>spring</DATE>. The <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> has passed an immigration bill
including an amendment that would cut illegal aliens from the
redistricting numbers, but it is not likely to clear <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> before
the next year's national head count.
   Sen. <PERSON>Richard Shelby</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-Ala.</LOCATION>, proposed, and won, the immigration
bill amendment that is supposed to exclude illegal aliens from the
redistricting process. It would give Secretary of Commerce <PERSON>Robert
Mosbacher</PERSON> the assignment of adjusting the census figures so that
illegal aliens don't count for purposes of redistributing <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION>
seats. It does not come with instructions, so the department would
have to figure out how.
   Shelby's amendment says only that the secretary is to ``make such
adjustments in total population figures as may be necessary, using
such methods and procedures as the secretary determines feasible and
appropriate'' to keep illegal aliens from being counted in
congressional reapportionment.
   That task would be perilous politically, since it would involve
taking <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> seats away from some states and giving them to others,
all on the basis of estimates. With 435 seats in the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION>, every
representative gained by a state is a representative lost by another.
   Opponents of the Shelby amendment, led by <PERSON>Sen. Edward M. Kennedy</PERSON>,
<LOCATION>D-Mass.</LOCATION>, said it was unconstitutional, as well as unworkable. ``The
framers of the Constitution intended to count all persons,'' <PERSON>Kennedy</PERSON>
said.
   The Constitution itself says the apportionment of the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> is to
be determined on the basis of ``the whole number of free persons,''
excluding Indians and counting every five slaves as three persons.
That was amended after the Civil War to say that the apportionment
of <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> seats will be based on ``the whole number of persons in
each state.''
   Neither the original article nor the amendment mentions
citizenship in connection with apportionment, although the term
``citizens'' is used in some other provisions. Opponents of the
amendment said that showed the authors of both documents wanted
everybody counted for purposes of apportionment.
   But <PERSON>Sen. Alan K. Simpson</PERSON>, <LOCATION>R-Wyo.</LOCATION>, said the people who wrote the
documents had no concept of illegal aliens because there weren't any
in their time.
   That came later, with immigration restrictions that began in <DATE>1875</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Sen. Bob Dole</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION>, the Republican leader, said the question
should be put squarely to the <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION>. He said it is unfair to
count illegal aliens in reapportionment. ``It just does not make any
sense,'' <PERSON>Dole</PERSON> said. ``It does violate the constitutional principle
of one man, one vote.''
   But opponents of the Shelby measure said apportionment doesn't
involve who votes and who doesn't. Women couldn't vote when the
Constitution and the 14th Amendment were adopted, but they always
were counted. Children can't vote, but they count, too.
   The amendment was adopted after the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> voted 58 to 41 against
a move to reject it, and 56 to 43 against scuttling it as
unconstitutional.
   <PERSON>Shelby</PERSON> said that is sure to put the matter into the hands of the
courts for a final judgment. ``Somebody is going to challenge it
...'' he said. ``Then, for the first time, we will let the <ORGANIZATION>Supreme
Court</ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> decide something that we need an answer
to ...''

<HEAD>Eleven States Get Preliminary Population Reports</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION> have topped the 1-million
population mark, according to the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION>, which is issuing
preliminary <DATE>1990</DATE> counts for 11 states.
   While 10 of the states showed population gains in data released
<DATE>Friday</DATE>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> recorded a decline from the <DATE>1980</DATE> national head count.
   The bureau said that it had counted 10,777,514 people in <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>,
down from 10,798,000 in <DATE>1980</DATE>.
   Officials stressed that the reports are preliminary. They are
designed to give local officials a chance to raise questions if
they find areas where they believe people have been missed or
overcounted.
   The final, official, census counts are scheduled for release on
<DATE>Dec. 31</DATE>.
   <DATE>Friday</DATE>'s report brings to 40 the number of states for which
preliminary counts have been published. The rest are expected in
the next week or two.
   Newly released state counts, and the census count in <DATE>1980</DATE> are:
   _<LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION>, 545,774, up from 402,000.
   _<LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>, 3,619,064, up from 2,718,000.
   _<LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION>, 3,272,460, up from 2,890,000.
   _<LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>, 1,095,237, up from 965,000.
   _<LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION>, 2,467,845, up from 2,364,000.
   _<LOCATION>Maryland</LOCATION>, 4,732,934, up from 4,217,000.
   _<LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION>, 1,193,287, up from 800,000.
   _<LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION>, 6,552,927, up from 5,882,000.
   _<LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, 10,777,514, down from 10,798,000.
   _<LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION>, 6,127,680, up from 5,347,000.
   _<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, 4,826,675, up from 4,132,000.

In a blow to <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> and other states with large immigrant populations, the 
<ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> voted <DATE>Friday</DATE> to bar the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> from counting illegal aliens in 
the <DATE>1990</DATE> population count. 
</P>
<P>
The action came on a voice vote, despite arguments from the <ORGANIZATION>Bush Administration</ORGANIZATION> 
and other opponents that it is both unconstitutional and unworkable. Just 
before the voice vote, the senators voted, 50 to 41, against killing the 
proposal to bar aliens from the count. 
</P>
<P>
A <ORGANIZATION>Senate-House conference committee</ORGANIZATION> will decide whether the prohibition against 
including illegal immigrants in the census totals will be retained or dropped 
from a <MONEY>$17.4-billion</MONEY> appropriations bill for the <ORGANIZATION>State</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Justice</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Commerce 
departments</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Even if the prohibition survives, Secretary of Commerce <PERSON>Robert A. Mosbacher</PERSON> has 
said that he would ask President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> to veto any bill that comes to his desk 
with such a provision. 
</P>
<P>
At stake are the number of seats in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> for <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, 
<LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> and other states that will be reapportioned on the basis 
of next year's census. 
</P>
<P>
Federal aid to states also is frequently based on population counts, so 
<MONEY>millions of dollars</MONEY> in grants and other funds made available on a per capita 
basis would be affected. 
</P>
<P>
The issue cuts across partisan lines in the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>, with Minority Leader <PERSON>Bob 
Dole</PERSON> (R-Kan.) arguing against the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> position on grounds that 
including illegal aliens in the census is unfair to American citizens. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Loss of Seats Cited 
</P>
<P>
"Some states will lose congressional seats because of illegal aliens," <PERSON>Dole</PERSON> 
argued. Sen. <PERSON>Thad Cochran</PERSON> (R-Miss.) said that <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION> both lost 
<ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> seats after the <DATE>1980</DATE> Census, and <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> -- centers of 
illegal immigration -- each gained seats. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is illegal aliens ought to be deported, not counted," <PERSON>Cochran</PERSON> 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. <PERSON>Pete Wilson</PERSON> (R-Calif.) countered that excluding illegal residents from the 
decennial census is unfair to the states that have suffered from a huge influx 
of immigration beyond the legal limits. 
</P>
<P>
"There are enormous additional costs for states who have had a surge of 
population," <PERSON>Wilson</PERSON> said, adding that those states should receive additional 
federal aid to cope with the added problems. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of a ban on counting illegal aliens said that a ban is impractical 
because the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> already has printed questionnaires that do not 
contain any question about legality of residence. 
</P>
<P>
For 190 years, said <PERSON>Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan</PERSON> (D-N.Y.), the federal 
government has counted all inhabitants without regard to citizenship in 
accordance with the Constitution's provisions. "Fiddling with the numbers" now 
will destroy confidence in the census results, he added. 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>'s action was sharply criticized by Undersecretary of Commerce 
<PERSON>Michael Darby</PERSON>, but he voiced hope that it would be reversed by a Senate-House 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
"There really is a widespread realization that this would not only be 
unconstitutional but literally impossible," <PERSON>Darby</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
But he added that he is "optimistic, cautiously optimistic," that <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> 
conferees would resist the Senate-approved ban and not force <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> to veto the 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Mario Moreno</PERSON>, head of the Mexican American Legal Defense Fund, said he was 
shocked by the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>'s decision. "It is going to have a dramatic and 
disastrous impact in the Hispanic community," <PERSON>Moreno</PERSON> said. "People are going to 
be discouraged from participating." 
</P>
<P>
A <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> spokesman took a more dispassionate view, however. 
</P>
<P>
"Our position is that we count everybody at their place of residence," said 
bureau spokesman <PERSON>James Gorman</PERSON>. "If <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> passes a law that says we will or 
will not count people, we will do what it says."

<HEAD>Northeast Slipping to Least Populated Region</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The densely settled <ORGANIZATION>Northeast</ORGANIZATION> has become the
nation's least populated region, falling behind the West for the
first time, the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> reported <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   The bureau also projected that <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> will surpass <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> for
second place behind <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> in population by <DATE>1995</DATE>.
   And between now and the <DATE>year 2000</DATE>, half of all <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> population
growth will occur in just three states: <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, the report said.
   The projections are based on assumptions about trends in births,
deaths, immigration and movement within the country, bureau
demographer <PERSON>Signe Wetrogen</PERSON> explained.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Northeast</ORGANIZATION> has been declining in its share of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
population, with less growth than other areas, <PERSON>Wetrogen</PERSON> said in a
telephone interview. ``It is the one region with the highest share
of population in the older ages, and has low birth rates.''
   Population shifts to the South and <LOCATION>West</LOCATION> in recent years have
drawn away many people in the prime ages of 18 to 24, ``so the
(Northeast) region is left with more older people, and it's left
without anybody to have more kids,'' she said.
   The Northeastern states, relatively smaller in land area than
other parts of the country, remain the mosty densely packed,
however. <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> leads the nation with more than 1,000 people
per square mile.
   Between <DATE>1987</DATE> and <DATE>1988</DATE>, the Western region increased from 49.6
million people to 50.5 million, the report said. At the same time,
the population of the <ORGANIZATION>Northeast</ORGANIZATION> edged upward from 50.1 million to
<MONEY>50.3 million</MONEY>, to slip into last place.
   The <DATE>1988</DATE> estimates listed the South with 85.1 million people,
followed by the <LOCATION>Midwest</LOCATION> with 59.6 million.
   Historical records show that, while it was the center of early
American development, the <ORGANIZATION>Northeast</ORGANIZATION> hasn't actually been the most
populous region since <DATE>1820</DATE>, when the South edged ahead. It remained
second until <DATE>1880</DATE>, falling to third behind both the <LOCATION>Midwest</LOCATION> and
South.
   By <DATE>1990</DATE>, the projections call for the South to have 87.3 million
people, followed by the <LOCATION>Midwest</LOCATION>, 59.8 million; West, 52.3 million;
and <ORGANIZATION>Northeast</ORGANIZATION>, 50.6 million.
   By <DATE>2000</DATE>, the counts are expected to be 96.9 million for the
South, 59.6 million for the <LOCATION>Midwest</LOCATION>, 59.4 million for the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION> and
51.8 million for the <ORGANIZATION>Northeast</ORGANIZATION>.
   By <DATE>2010</DATE>, the report added, the West could replace the <LOCATION>Midwest</LOCATION> as
the second-most-populous region.
   State population projections showed <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> remaining
unchallenged as the largest state, growing from 28 million people
today to 29.1 million in <DATE>1990</DATE> and 33.5 million in <DATE>2000</DATE>.
   <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> is expected to surpass <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> for second rank by <DATE>1995</DATE>.
The <ORGANIZATION>Empire State</ORGANIZATION> now leads <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> 17.7 million to 17.2 million, but
by <DATE>1995</DATE> Texas is projected to have just over 19 million people,
with <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> at only 17.9 million.
   <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> is expected to remain the fourth-largest state, although
by the year <DATE>2010</DATE> it may be closing in on <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> as well, the
<ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> said.
   By the <DATE>year 2000</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Illinois</ORGANIZATION> will have replaced <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> in
fifth place and <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION> will move into 10th, displacing <LOCATION>North
Carolina</LOCATION>, the report said.
   The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> population was projected to grow from 243.3 million in
<DATE>1987</DATE> to 267.7 million in <DATE>2000</DATE>.
   In that period, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> is expected to add 6 million
residents, <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> 3.5 million and <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> 3.3 million. That means
those states would have growth of 12.8 million people, <PERCENT>52 percent</PERCENT>
of the national increase of 24.4 million.
   <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>District of
Columbia</LOCATION> were projected to lose population this decade.
   Population losses in the <DATE>1990s</DATE> were predicted for nine more
states: <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wisconsin</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>North Dakota</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION>. On the other hand, growth
was predicted to resume in the <LOCATION>District of Columbia</LOCATION>.
   During the <DATE>1990s</DATE>, the maturing of the post-World War II Baby
Boom generation will be reflected in the growth of the 45-64 age
group in all parts of the country. The number of people aged 24 to
44 is expected to drop in the <LOCATION>Northeast</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Midwest</LOCATION> but grow
elsewhere, the report said.
   The study said the South continues to have the largest
percentage of blacks in its population, <PERCENT>16 percent</PERCENT>. More than half
of all black Americans reside in the <LOCATION>South</LOCATION>, and that is expected to
continue.

<HEAD>Military Personnel Overseas Will Be Counted in 1990 Census</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American military personnel stationed overseas
will be counted in the <DATE>1990</DATE> census, but the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>
blocked a related move to bar the counting of illegal aliens.
   The decision to include military personnel in the count was
announced by the <ORGANIZATION>Commerce Department</ORGANIZATION> at the start of a hearing on a
bill to require the action.
   According to <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>'s announcement, the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> will work
with the <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> to count the 1.2 million to 1.6 million military
and civilian <ORGANIZATION>Defense Department</ORGANIZATION> workers overseas.
   At the same time the sometimes emotional debate over leaving out
undocumented aliens was under way both in committee and on the
<ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> floor, where Rep. <PERSON>Tom Ridge</PERSON>, <LOCATION>R-Pa.</LOCATION>, failed in an effort to
attach the ban to an appropriations measure.
   His amendment was offered to a <MONEY>$5.8 billion</MONEY> appropriation bill
for running the <ORGANIZATION>State</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Justice</ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION>Commerce Departments</ORGANIZATION> next year,
including <MONEY>$800 million</MONEY> for carrying out the <DATE>1990</DATE> census. The bill
was approved by a vote of 258 to 165, and sent to the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>.
   The dispute cuts close to home for the 435 <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> members, since
the Census count will be used to redistribute <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> seats among the
states. States which have grown in population will get more seats,
others will lose them.
   Many Northern states, already facing losses because of
population shifts to the South and West, fear additional gains by
the Sun Belt states and large urban centers because of the
settlement of illegal aliens in those areas.
   Hence, <ORGANIZATION>Ridge</ORGANIZATION>'s amendment, rejected after extensive parliamentary
maneuvering.
   Opponents pointed out that the Constitution specifically
requires <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> seats to be apportioned based on all the ``persons''
residing in a state.
   ``Every Census since the Constitution was created has counted
all residents of the states, both citizens and non-citizens,''
observed Rep. <PERSON>Don Edwards</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-Calif</LOCATION>.
   ``<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> is empowered to identify those to be counted'' in the
Census, responded Ridge.
   The count, scheduled for <DATE>April 1, 1990</DATE>, will cost <MONEY>$4 billion</MONEY>,
said Ridge, asserting that the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> has the money to
identify and separate out illegal aliens, but doesn't want to.
   Rep. <PERSON>William F. Goodling</PERSON>, <LOCATION>R-Pa.</LOCATION>, contended that at the time the
Constitution was written there were no illegal aliens, all new
arrivals were welcome.
   Rep. <PERSON>Marvyn Dymally</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-Calif.</LOCATION>, countered that there have always
been undocumenmted aliens in this country. The difference is that
in the early days they came from <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>.
   The debate, <PERSON>Dymally</PERSON> said, is really over the fact that
population shifts will lead <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> seats to <ORGANIZATION>Southern</ORGANIZATION> and Western
states and that undocumented aliens are being blamed.
   ``<LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>, I don't care what they do, unless they go down
to the <LOCATION>Southwest</LOCATION> and bring the people back, they're going to lose a
seat,'' said <PERSON>Dymally</PERSON>.
   Rep. <PERSON>Tim Valentine</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-N.C.</LOCATION>, however, said he cannot understand
why illegal aliens should be allowed to dilute the representation
of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> citizens.
   Counting illegal aliens ``is not fair. It may be Constitutional,
but it's just not right,'' said <PERSON>Valentine</PERSON>.
   ``The question is how are we going to identify those that are
here illegally that are not entitled to representation in this
body,'' said Rep. <PERSON>James Slattery</PERSON>, D-Kan. ``That will be tough to do
... the least we should so is to make that extraordinary effort.''
   ``You're now asking the Bureau of the Census to be judge and
jury in determining who should be counted,'' responded Rep. <PERSON>Robert
Garcia</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-N.Y.</LOCATION>
   The questions of counting undocumented aliens and overseas
military personnal have been tied together in many debates, with
the question raised of the fairness of including illegal aliens but
not American servicemen and servicewomen in the figures used for
apportionment.
   In the past, service members overseas generally have not been
included in census counts used to apportion seats in the <ORGANIZATION>House of
Representatives</ORGANIZATION>.
   That is because census officials considered it impossible to
determine accurately in which state an individual should be
counted. Many military people move often.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> said it will investigate ways to make that
judgment in the <DATE>1990</DATE> census. Possibilities include listing a
service person's last state of residence for more than six months,
or the state where he or she may maintain a home in this country.
   Census officials have generally opposed any attempt to delete
illegal aliens, contending that they have no method of determining
who is in the country legally. Asking people about their status
would likely result in people lying or refusing to participate in
the count, officials say, resulting in a potential undercount of
residents in many areas.

<TEXT>
   From the great cities to the small towns,
<LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s municipalities are telling the federal government they
can't possibly be as small as census takers say.
   By the thousands, local officials are demanding something be
done about the <DATE>1990</DATE> Census. Even states are contesting the
preliminary figures, aware that the more residents they are
credited with, the more federal aid they will get and the greater
their representation in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> will be.
   Some voices from the nationwide chorus:
   -``Unadulterated nonsense ... statistical grand larceny,'' said
<LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON>David N. Dinkins</PERSON>.
   -``There are errors everywhere,'' said <LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION> research director
<ORGANIZATION>Juliette Okotie-Eboh</ORGANIZATION>.
   -``It really stretches credibility to the breaking point,'' said
<LOCATION>Hartford</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Conn.</LOCATION>, Mayor <PERSON>Carrie Saxon Perry</PERSON>.
   -``They missed our farthest south street,'' said <PERSON>Hays</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>City</LOCATION> Clerk <PERSON>Judy Grothe</PERSON>.
   All were reacting to the preliminary results of the <ORGANIZATION>Census
Bureau</ORGANIZATION>'s <DATE>April 15</DATE> head count.
   The preliminary reports were sent out in late <DATE>August</DATE> and early
this month to give officials a chance to file challenges in time
for the bureau to double-check its numbers before announcing its
final count <DATE>Dec. 31</DATE>.
   Census Director <PERSON>Barbara Everitt Bryant</PERSON> has already told <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>
there will be big changes in the initial numbers.
   ``The census count will increase in practically every
jurisdiction throughout the country because of ongoing coverage
improvement programs,'' she said.
   Even some states that posted gains in the preliminary figures
are upset.
   Take <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>. Despite recording significantly more people, state
officials say the count is not high enough.
   ``Our conservative estimate puts the state's population at about
17 million. If the census' final count ... stays with 16.8 million,
<LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> will definitely be shortchanged,'' state Comptroller <PERSON>Bob
Bullock</PERSON> said.
   But it is clearly from the jurisdictions that showed losses that
the loudest complaints are coming.
   Such as <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION>, credited with the largest population drop
of any state.
   ``Many West Virginians live up dirt roads and hollows, and
proving their existence has been as difficult as it has been for
the Census Bureau to find them,'' said <PERSON>Bob Brunner</PERSON>, spokesman for
Gov. <PERSON>Gaston Caperton</PERSON>.
   Or <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>, where <PERSON>Vincent Carocci</PERSON>, spokesman for
<LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON>Robert P. Casey</PERSON>, said the preliminary count
underestimated the population by 200,000 to 300,000. Census takers
undercounted the state's cities, <PERSON>Carocci</PERSON> said, because people there
are ``just harder to count.''
   Or tiny <LOCATION>Jacksonburg</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, which the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> said has 14
residents. Last week, 39 Jacksonburg residents appeared at a
protest of the count. Between them, they said they could count at
least 26 more people in the town.
   Denver Mayor <PERSON>Federico Pena</PERSON> was ``stunned.'' <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON>Mario
Cuomo</PERSON> exclaimed, ``I don't believe it.'' <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON>Maynard
Jackson</PERSON> said if errors aren't corrected, ``we'll see them in
court.''
   Barraged with such complaints, the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> is having
workers do rechecks of some neighborhoods, add late reports and
factor in military personnel overseas.
   The bureau has its hands full.
   In <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>, officials say as many as 75,000 residents were missed.
   In <LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION>, said a representative of Avoyelles Parish, ``We
know for sure that's not right. Several types of errors were made
but I don't know what kind. ``Something went wrong, but I guarantee
that we will get to the bottom of this.''
   Why are the numbers so important?
   Simple. After the nation's population is counted every 10 years,
the <ORGANIZATION>House of Representatives</ORGANIZATION> is reapportioned and federal and state
aid formulas are adjusted. Losing people, or not growing as fast as
other places, can mean a loss of political power and federal aid
until the next census.
   The census news wasn't bad everywhere, though.
   <LOCATION>Seattle</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> state officials are pleased with the
preliminary counts, which exceeded their own estimates.
   ``We still think there are people out there that the census did
not count, but generally we think they did a pretty good job,''
said urban research analyst <PERSON>Eric Friedli</PERSON>.
   ``My impression is that we have a smaller proportion of people
who aren't going to respond or who aren't going to be counted. I
don't see any outstanding reason to say this is a bad census,''
said <PERSON>Lawrence Weisser</PERSON>, a state research investigator.
   Officials in <LOCATION>Sacramento</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, are puzzled by preliminary
census figures <PERCENT>5 percent</PERCENT> higher than they had estimated. ``I'm at a
loss,'' said <PERSON>Scott Mende</PERSON>, a city planner.

   Seven of the 10 fastest-growing metropolitan areas in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> are in <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, a new <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> report shows. 

   The population of the <LOCATION>Naples</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla.</LOCATION>, area grew faster than that of any other metropolitan area between <DATE>1980</DATE> and <DATE>1987</DATE>, surging <PERCENT>48.8%</PERCENT> to 127,900. 

   All of the 61 metropolitan areas that grew at a pace twice as fast as the nation as a whole are in the South or West. 
The population of the entire country grew <PERCENT>7.4%</PERCENT> between <DATE>1980</DATE> and <DATE>1987</DATE>. 

   Other <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> metropolitan areas on the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION>'s top 10 list are <LOCATION>Ocala</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fort Myers-Cape Coral</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fort Pierce</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>Cape Canaveral</LOCATION> area, <LOCATION>West Palm Beach</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Orlando</LOCATION>. 
All but <LOCATION>Orlando</LOCATION> are largely resort or retirement communities, the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> said. 

   Metropolitan areas outside <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> making the top 10 list are <LOCATION>Austin</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, McAllen-Edinburg-Mission, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Las Cruces</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.M.</LOCATION> 

   The government defines a metropolitan area as "a population nucleus" of at least 50,000, usually a city, plus its immediate suburbs and adjacent communities "having a high degree of economic and social integration." 
The <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> now identifies 282 such areas. 

   Among big cities, the fastest-growing metropolitan areas are <LOCATION>Phoenix</LOCATION>, up <PERCENT>29.8%</PERCENT> in the period, and <LOCATION>Dallas-Fort Worth</LOCATION>, up <PERCENT>27.1%</PERCENT>. 

   Of the 54 areas that lost population between <DATE>1980</DATE> and <DATE>1987</DATE>, 41 were in the <LOCATION>Northeast</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Midwest</LOCATION>. 
The biggest percentage decline in population was in <LOCATION>Duluth</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Minn.</LOCATION>, where the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> estimates the population fell <PERCENT>9.4%</PERCENT>.

<TEXT>
   Most Americans will pay attention to the <DATE>1990</DATE> Census for about half an hour -- just long enough to fill out the form. 
But Members of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> from both parties, aware that Census results affect <MONEY>billions of dollars</MONEY> in federal aid and the distribution of <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> seats, have been trying to second-guess the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> and influence the outcome. 
Forcing such tinkering on the bureau will compromise the nation's head count. 

   Rep. <PERSON>Thomas Petri</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Wisconsin</LOCATION> Republican, wants to stop counting illegal aliens for the purposes of reapportioning <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> seats. 
Otherwise, <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> seats would be transferred to states with large illegal populations. 
Last week, a <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> committee attached his proposal to a bill by Democratic Rep. <PERSON>Mervyn Dymally</PERSON> that would force the Census Bureau to compensate for any undercount of minorities. 
Rep. <PERSON>Dymally</PERSON>, who opposes the Petri measure, then cast the deciding vote to kill his own bill. 

   But efforts to tug the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> this way or that aren't over. 
Rep. <PERSON>Petri</PERSON> intends to reintroduce his proposal next year, and <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION> is preparing to sue the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> to force its count to include the estimated three million people it will miss nationwide. 
Adoption of either proposal would make an accurate head count more difficult and inject politics into one of the few government agencies that does its job without constant micromanagement by <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>. 

   Rep. <PERSON>Petri</PERSON> says the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> counted two million illegal aliens in <DATE>1980</DATE>, and the total next time could top five million. 
States with few illegal aliens, such as <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>, will lose <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> seats to such states as <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> if illegal aliens are counted. 
Rep. <PERSON>Petri</PERSON> says some citizens would thus be denied an equal voice in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>, adding that it is "repugnant" to allocate <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> seats on the basis of people "who would be deported if the laws were being enforced." 

   Actually, we think the immigration laws Rep. <PERSON>Petri</PERSON> speaks of are more repugnant than anything the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> could cook up. 
In any event, the Constitution clearly states that all "free persons" are to be counted for reapportionment purposes, and most courts have held that the Framers were well aware of the semantic distinction between "person" and "citizen." 

   Rep. <PERSON>Dymally</PERSON> agrees efforts to exclude aliens are impractical, but he says the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> must account for the estimated <PERCENT>1.4%</PERCENT> of the population -- including many urban blacks -- that they missed in <DATE>1980</DATE>. 
Rep. <PERSON>Dymally</PERSON> claims not adjusting for this undercount will deny minorities adequate representation and their share of federal dollars. 
He doesn't mention it could also send his liberal colleagues from declining population areas into retirement. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Dymally</PERSON> says adjusting for an undercount is feasible, but the <ORGANIZATION>Commerce Department</ORGANIZATION> decided last year not to change procedures, saying that whichever one of 24 competing methodologies it adopted would be statistically suspect. 
No doubt the Census will again miss some people, but attempting to quantify that total will only introduce more mistakes into the process. 
The party in power would always be tempted to answer such complaints by using a new method that aided it politically. 

   The <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> plans to work with the <ORGANIZATION>NAACP</ORGANIZATION> and other groups to achieve the most immediate, practical solution -- encouraging minorities and others to participate in the Census. 
That is more likely to ensure an accurate count than turning the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> census into a constant game of political number-shopping.

   WASHINGTON -- The populations of many big industrial
states stagnated in the 1980s, while Americans swarmed to the
Sun Belt and the West Coast, according to preliminary U.S.
Census Bureau figures.
   The population of New York state barely grew over the past
decade, rising a mere 0.4%, to 17,626,586 from 17,558,000.
Over the past year, it actually declined. The populations of
Illinois and Pennsylvania also slipped slightly between 1980
and 1990.

Dividend From Tax Returns:
Details on Migration Patterns
---
By <PERSON>Eugene Carlson</PERSON>
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal
05/05/87
WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)
GOVMT
INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (IRS)
   THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE isn't the only federal agency peeking at your income-tax records. 
Sometime this <DATE>fall</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> will hand over to the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> a massive computer file containing personal and basic income information for everyone who filed a tax return for <DATE>1986</DATE>. 

   This sensitive transfer of tax records has been taking place annually since the early <DATE>1970s</DATE>, when the aim was to determine how to divide <MONEY>billions of dollars</MONEY> of federal revenue-sharing money among communities. 

   But revenue sharing is dead. 
These days, the tax records are mostly used to trace movement of the American public from place to place. 
The migration figures, purged of names and income, can be purchased from the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION>. 
A bank in a high-growth area, for example, could use the figures to see precisely where its potential new customers are arriving from. 

   THE MIGRATION PROJECT is statistically awesome. 
Using your Social Security number, the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> will compare the address that you printed on your <DATE>1986</DATE> tax return with the address on your previous year's tax form. 
The idea is to see if you changed residence between tax filings and, if so, from where to where. 

   A similar address scan is done on every other individual tax return. 
Matching the estimated 103 million returns filed for <DATE>1986</DATE> with the roughly 99 million from <DATE>1985</DATE>, adding the number of exemptions claimed, and charting where everybody moved down to the county level is no small data-processing chore. 
The project will tie up the bureau's huge Univac 1100/84 computer for some 700 hours, a computer run roughly equivalent to the first tally of the entire <DATE>1990</DATE> national census. 

   When the address information is combined with the number of exemptions claimed by the tax filer, the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> data yield the single best picture of population migration available during the 10 years between national head counts. 

   This sort of intelligence is solid gold to market researchers, developers and planners who are forever seeking better ways of predicting and charting state or regional population growth. 
Migration data is vital in the local growth equation because what sets the growth rate of one area apart from another is almost entirely the movement of people. 
Birth and death rates, the other main population components, are relatively constant throughout the nation. 

   DEMOGRAPHERS USE voter registrations, auto registrations, school enrollments, and other social indicators to figure out whether a state is gaining or losing population through migration. 
What the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> figures show in addition to this are the origins and destinations of these migrants. 

   The <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> numbers, for example, illuminate the strong population flow between <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> and show how that stream has reversed in the last decade. 
At the end of the <DATE>1970s</DATE>, some 5,000 more people were moving to <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION> from <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> each year than were leaving <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION> for <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>. 

   Over the next few years, <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION>'s attraction for Californians gradually diminished, and by <DATE>1983</DATE> the migrant flow between the two states was about equal. 
The most recent <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> figures show that the flow has tilted steeply toward <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> with net in-migration of 5,400 Coloradans in the year ended <DATE>April 15, 1985</DATE>. 

   Arizona pulled a net 4,400 residents from <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION> in the latest reporting year. 
The states with the biggest net population losses to <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION>: <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION>. 

   New Jersey massaged the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> data and found that it is pulling in people from heavily populated Northern states such as <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION>, while losing residents, on balance, to increasingly urbanized states in the <LOCATION>South and West</LOCATION>, such as <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION>. 

   ARMED WITH this knowledge, a <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> demographer assumes that most of those leaving for <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> are retirees, while most of the <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION> newcomers are in the active labor market. 
The makeup of these two migrant streams has very different implications for the state's future population. 

   The <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> data isn't a perfect migration mirror. 
Because it only catches tax filers, migrants below the income-filing threshold don't show up on the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> printouts. 
The <DATE>1986</DATE> tax law, which eliminates still more people from the tax rolls, will make the movement of low-income Americans, many of them elderly, even harder to trace. 

   The <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION>'s migration methodology also assumes that all the exemptions listed on a tax form change residence when the tax filer does. 
That isn't always so, as in the case of divorced couples where one parent has custody of the children, and the other has financial support. 
A single person who marries, moves and the next year files a joint return, is also lost in this tabulation. 

   Addresses can be a problem for the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION>, especially at the local level. 
Taxpayers sometimes list post-office-box numbers on their return from a different jurisdiction than their home. 

   Affluent taxpayers sometimes file from the offices of their lawyers or accountants.

   Census Bureau
   Says It Missed
   2% of Population

   WASHINGTON -- The 1990 census missed more individuals --
both proportionately and in absolute numbers -- than in 1980,
undercounting the U.S. population by 2%, according to
preliminary findings by the Census Bureau.
   The new estimates could have far-reaching effects on
congressional redistricting and the allocation of federal
dollars to state and local governments.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The findings are based on two <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> projects: a
post-enumeration survey conducted in selected areas after the
<DATE>1990</DATE> census and a demographic analysis of state, local and
federal administrative records.
   The census count for <DATE>1990</DATE> is 248,709,873 nationwide.
According to the post-enumeration figures, however, the
census count should be somewhere between 252,982,000 and
254,989,000.
   Under a <DATE>1989</DATE> court order in a lawsuit brought by <LOCATION>New York
City</LOCATION> and several other cities, the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration must
decide by mid-July whether to adjust the <DATE>1990</DATE> count based on
the post-enumeration survey. The decision will be made after
<ORGANIZATION>Commerce</ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON>Robert Mosbacher</PERSON> reviews recommendations
by the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> and several independent experts
concerning the post-enumeration data.
   The post-enumeration findings "continue to strengthen the
case that failure to adjust will cause substantial damage in
many, many places across the country," said Rep. <PERSON>Tom Sawyer</PERSON>
(D., <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>), who heads the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> census and population
subcommittee.
   But Census officials were quick to warn that the
post-enumeration data could reflect errors in the
post-enumeration survey itself rather than in the census
count. "We know we have the symptoms of an undercount," said
<PERSON>C. Louis Kincannon</PERSON>, bureau deputy director. But he stressed
the need to make sure that the "cure is not worse than the
ailment."
   If the population count is adjusted, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> and other
Western states probably will gain the greatest benefits,
along with the <ORGANIZATION>District of Columbia</ORGANIZATION> and the rest of the
South-Atlantic region, according to the post-enumeration
estimates. In both regions, the census undercount was found
to be proportionally greater than it was for the entire <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
   The regions that will benefit the least from an adjustment
include <LOCATION>New England</LOCATION>, the Mid-Atlantic area and the <LOCATION>Midwest</LOCATION>.
No state figures are likely to be adjusted downward, but
population counts for certain cities and counties in states
such as <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> might be lowered, according to
bureau assistant director <PERSON>Peter Bounpane</PERSON>.
   Despite doubts about the post-enumeration data, it isn't
likely the bureau's demographic analysis data will change
significantly, <PERSON>Mr. Bounpane</PERSON> said. According to the analysis,
the <DATE>1990</DATE> census missed <PERCENT>1.8%</PERCENT> of the population, compared with
<PERCENT>1.3%</PERCENT> in <DATE>1980</DATE>.
   The undercount appears to be particularly sharp for
blacks. According to the bureau's demographic analysis, the
census failed to count <PERCENT>7.2%</PERCENT> of the black population, compared
with <PERCENT>4.7%</PERCENT> in <DATE>1980</DATE>. A bureau official said the black
population is harder to count than the population at large,
possibly because a high proportion of blacks are low-income.
A black majority in the <LOCATION>District of Columbia</LOCATION> may explain why
the census apparently missed a huge fraction of people living
in the bureau's back yard: According to the post-enumeration
survey, roughly <PERCENT>4%</PERCENT> to <PERCENT>8%</PERCENT> of all <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION>, residents
were uncounted.

   The countries five largest cities retained
their rankings in the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION>'s latest estimates of city
populations but <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> replaced <LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION> as the nation's sixth
largest city.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> said that <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Jacksonville</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Fla.</LOCATION>, also moved up in the rankings of the country's 25 largest
cities in a new report prepared for release today.
   <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION> ranked No. 1 in population in <DATE>1988</DATE> followed by <LOCATION>Los
Angeles</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION>, the same positions
these cities held in <DATE>1986</DATE>, the last time the bureau estimated city
populations.
   But <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> replaced <LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION> as the nation's sixth largest
city while <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION> passed <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Indianapolis</LOCATION> to move
into 12th place. In the other change in the top 25, <LOCATION>Jacksonville</LOCATION>
replaced <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION>, as the 16th largest city.
   Since <DATE>1970</DATE>, there have been major shifts in the ranking of the
most populous cities, with many in the <LOCATION>East</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Midwest</LOCATION> being
replaced by cities in the <LOCATION>South and West</LOCATION>. Seven of the 10 largest
cities in <DATE>1970</DATE> were in the <LOCATION>North and East</LOCATION> but by <DATE>1988</DATE> there were
only four in these regions. <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION> had
been replaced by <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>San Antonio</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Phoenix</LOCATION>.
   Among the 25 largest cities, 12 are estimated to have lost
population from <DATE>1986</DATE> to <DATE>1988</DATE>, including <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION>.
<LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION>' population loss dropped the city under 1 million, a level
<LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> had reached for the first time in <DATE>1986</DATE>.
   The bureau's new estimates were prepared using procedures that
rely on measuring components of population change since <DATE>1986</DATE> such
as statistics on births and deaths and monitoring of federal income
tax returns to make estimates of net migration into an area.
   The bureau's population estimates cover inside the city limits
and do not include suburbs. Populations and rankings for
metropolitan areas, including suburbs, can differ substantially
from those for cities.
   Following are the <DATE>1988</DATE> Census population estimates for the
country's 25 largest cities, with each figure followed by the <DATE>1986</DATE>
estimate. The figures are in thousands:

<HEAD>Census Reaches 99 Percent of Homes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> is closing in on the last <PERCENT>1
percent</PERCENT> of American households that haven't yet been tallied.
   The <DATE>1990</DATE> count has reached <PERCENT>99 percent</PERCENT> of all homes, officials
proclaimed <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, despite a disappointing start in <DATE>April</DATE>.
   The door-to-door counting will continue at least through autumn
in areas where the work is not complete, officials have said.
   In many regions a ``were you counted'' campaign is starting in
an effort to reach people who have been overlooked so far.
   ``Without the willingness of hundreds of thousands of Americans
who volunteered and stuck with a tough job, we would not be where
we are now,'' <ORGANIZATION>Commerce</ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON>Robert A. Mosbacher</PERSON> said in a
statement.
   With more than 100 million households across the nation, the <PERCENT>99
percent</PERCENT> mark means that 1 million homes remain to be counted.
   Officials hope the new campaign will reach many of them through
posters in stores and community centers, newspaper advertising and
similar efforts. People will be encouraged to call or write the
census bureau so they can be counted.
   The results of the census, taken every 10 years, are used to
reapportion seats in the <ORGANIZATION>House of Representatives</ORGANIZATION> and to distribute
<MONEY>billions of dollars</MONEY> in federal money over the next decade.
   With such high political and financial stakes, the effort has
attracted close attention. Minority groups are concerned about
being undercounted and cities have claimed that many of their
people are missed, especially in hard to count inner-city areas.
   A group of large cities led by <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> has sued in an effort to
get the final totals adjusted to account for this assumed
undercount.
   Census forms were mailed out to most Americans in <DATE>March</DATE>, but
only <PERCENT>63 percent</PERCENT> were returned because of delivery problems and
apparent public confusion. Thus the door-to-door effort starting in
<DATE>April</DATE> had to be increased, likely adding <MONEY>several million dollars</MONEY> to
the <MONEY>$2.5 billion-plus</MONEY> cost.
   Officials said more than 80 million of the completed census
forms have been processed at census offices. In the <DATE>1980</DATE> census
that processing didn't begin until <DATE>August</DATE>.
   The bureau is required to report the population of each state to
President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> by <DATE>Dec. 31</DATE>, and Census Director <PERSON>Barbara Everitt
Bryant</PERSON> said she is confident that deadline will be met.
   Nationwide, the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> said <PERCENT>100 percent</PERCENT> of households
have been counted in 27 states, while work remains to be done in 23
states and the <ORGANIZATION>District of Columbia</ORGANIZATION>.
   Those with the count still incomplete are:
   <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>, <PERCENT>97.5 percent</PERCENT>; <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, <PERCENT>94.4 percent</PERCENT>; <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION>, <PERCENT>99.7
percent</PERCENT>; <LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION>, <PERCENT>96.3 percent</PERCENT>; <LOCATION>District of Columbia</LOCATION>, <PERCENT>88.7
percent</PERCENT>; <LOCATION>Delaware</LOCATION>, <PERCENT>94.3 percent</PERCENT>; <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION>, <PERCENT>99.1 percent</PERCENT>; <LOCATION>Maryland</LOCATION>,
<PERCENT>94.4 percent</PERCENT>.
   Also, <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION>, <PERCENT>97.4 percent</PERCENT>; <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>, <PERCENT>99.4 percent</PERCENT>; <LOCATION>New
Jersey</LOCATION>, <PERCENT>98.9 percent</PERCENT>; <LOCATION>New Mexico</LOCATION>, <PERCENT>98.9 percent</PERCENT>; <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, <PERCENT>89
percent</PERCENT>; <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION>, <PERCENT>98.3 percent</PERCENT>; <LOCATION>North Dakota</LOCATION>, <PERCENT>99.5 percent</PERCENT>.
   And <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, <PERCENT>99.8 percent</PERCENT>; <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>, <PERCENT>98.1 percent</PERCENT>; <LOCATION>Rhode
Island</LOCATION>, <PERCENT>99.2 percent</PERCENT>; <LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION>, <PERCENT>95.1 percent</PERCENT>; <LOCATION>South Dakota</LOCATION>,
<PERCENT>99.5 percent</PERCENT>; <LOCATION>Tennessee</LOCATION>, <PERCENT>99 percent</PERCENT>; <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION>, <PERCENT>99.7 percent</PERCENT>; <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION>,
<PERCENT>99.6 percent</PERCENT>; <LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION>, <PERCENT>99.7 percent</PERCENT>.
   Major cities where the bureau says it has counted all the
households are <LOCATION>Austin</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>; <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>; <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION>; <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>;
<LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION>; <LOCATION>El Paso</LOCATION>; <LOCATION>Fort Worth</LOCATION>; <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION>; <LOCATION>Indianapolis</LOCATION>; <LOCATION>Jacksonville</LOCATION>,

<LOCATION>Oklahoma City</LOCATION>; <LOCATION>San Antonio</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Seattle</LOCATION>.
   Cities where the bureau said the count is still incomplete
include <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>, <PERCENT>97.3 percent</PERCENT>; <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION>, <PERCENT>97 percent</PERCENT>; <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>, <PERCENT>90.9

   Census '90 Indicates a New Megalopolis

   SAVAGE, Md. -- The volunteer fire company's ladies'
auxiliary still holds its all-you-can-eat spaghetti dinners
for $5. The Methodist church still puts on its ham-and-oyster
feast. The regulars still linger over coffee at Ma's Kettle,
just as they've done for years.
   But this old mill town has changed in the past decade.
There are two new schools. Across the railroad bridge, a
tract-housing development has transformed fields into a
forest of roofs, with a horizon full of chimneys and
skylights. There are new streets with names like Thamesmeade
Road. And Jan Arnold, Savage's only mail carrier, no longer
can deliver the whole town's mail by 10 a.m. These days she
isn't done until 5:30 p.m.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "I like the idea that we live in the country," says <PERSON>Bob
Scaggs</PERSON>, a local historian. "But, my goodness, there's less
country here than there was before."
   So much less that the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> is about to classify
Savage as an urban area, eradicating the only slice of rural
land separating the <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION>
metropolitan areas. With the entire 35-mile stretch between
the two center cities likely to be deemed urban, business
leaders in both cities are pressing the <ORGANIZATION>White House Office of
Management and Budget</ORGANIZATION> to declare <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION> one
huge metropolitan area -- what is technically called a
"combined metropolitan statistical area," or <ORGANIZATION>CMSA</ORGANIZATION>.
   Such a decision would instantly create the nation's
fourth-largest market and, its backers hope, a marketing
bonanza. Other areas have found that consolidating
metropolitan areas for marketing purposes can have a huge
benefit.
   In <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Lawrence</PERSON> and Salem, two medium-sized
cities north of <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>, now are marketed as part of the
Boston/Lawrence/Salem area, making them part of the nation's
10th-biggest market. Together, <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Fort Worth</LOCATION>
constitute the seventh-biggest market. And now that <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION>
and Niagara Falls constitute one market, development
officials in <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> can tout their area as a tourism mecca.
   Over the years, such designations have had big impact on
such diverse activities as cellular-phone marketing,
transportation programs and federal spending. A decade ago,
after the last census, Republican <PERSON>Sen. Robert Dole</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION>
slipped a 25-word amendment through <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> to include rural
<LOCATION>Harvey County</LOCATION> in the <LOCATION>Wichita</LOCATION> Metropolitan Statistical Area,
permitting the county's three hospitals to be eligible for
Medicare reimbursement under an advantageous urban formula
rather than under a less-generous one used for rural areas.
   A budget-office decision on the <LOCATION>Washington-Baltimore</LOCATION> areas
has historic implications. "If <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION> do
combine, it will be the largest such consolidation in world
history," says <PERSON>Richard Forrestal</PERSON>, chief of the
population-distribution branch of the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION>. "There
is no other case where urban areas of this size have grown
together to the point where they could be considered a single
metropolitan area."
   Backers of the consolidation expect that the new
population numbers that are now beginning to trickle out of
the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> will only prove what residents of the two
cities -- and those here in <LOCATION>Savage</LOCATION>, in the middle -- already
know: Suburban sprawl and commuting patterns have blurred the
lines between the <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> areas. And now
they are hoping for a federal ruling acknowledging that the
two metropolitan areas -- covering 6,948 square miles in 17
counties and traversed by 22,000 miles of public roads -- are
one.
   A budget-office ruling favoring the combination would have
implications that would reach into every one of the estimated
2.4 million households in the region. "It would help -- a lot
-- in efforts to attract international firms and capital,"
says <PERSON>William Wrench</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Northern Virginia</LOCATION> developer who is
president of the <ORGANIZATION>Greater Washington Board of Trade</ORGANIZATION>. "It's
pretty simple: It's a lot easier to sell the fourth-biggest
market." (<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> is now the sixth-biggest market in the
country and <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION> is the 16th.)
   Local business leaders believe they would be able to lure
more development and retail activity to the area and forge
new trade links abroad. "Fireworks aren't going to go off
when this happens and the rivers are still going to flow in
the same direction," says <PERSON>Robert Grow</PERSON>, deputy director of the
<ORGANIZATION>Washington-Baltimore Regional Association</ORGANIZATION>. "But we'll have a
big marketing advantage."
   Many of these same business leaders lobbied the budget
office a decade ago, only to find that the two metropolitan
regions didn't meet the bureaucrats' standards. But they are
confident that this time will be different. Indeed, a single
square mile area of Savage that a decade ago was home to
fewer than 300 souls now holds 10 times that many -- far more
than the 1,000 per square mile that the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> uses to
define an urban area.
   The census statistics underline important changes that are
transforming the region. "It used to be that you knew
everyone in town," says <PERSON>Agnes Riley</PERSON>, a lifelong Savage
resident who is the bookkeeper and secretary at a local
real-estate company. "Now you don't."
   The spillover from <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, combined with
workers from <LOCATION>Fort Meade</LOCATION>, a nearby <ORGANIZATION>Johns Hopkins University</ORGANIZATION>
laboratory and a <ORGANIZATION>National Security Agency</ORGANIZATION> installation, have
given the town a different look. The <ORGANIZATION>Bowling Brook Farms</ORGANIZATION>
development is full of young women going to aerobics classes
in pink sweat suits and couples that shoo their children up
the pressure-treated wood steps, onto the deck and into the
door at dusk.
   "This was a very small blue-collar town," says <PERSON>Bobby Ray
Mitchell</PERSON>, who as a boy went to class in the old red-brick
schoolhouse up the road. "People's fathers and grandfathers
worked in the mill together. Today the town is full of new
people. We even have the yuppie crowd."
   But even if Savage, the missing urban link, has gone
metro, the notion of one <LOCATION>Baltimore-Washington</LOCATION> area seems
jarring to many people. One city is famous for its sausage
and crab cakes, the other for its quorum calls and conference
committees. One dotes on its steamed mussels, the other
worships political muscle.
   "You only have to get in your car and drive around to see
that these areas are integrated," says <PERSON>Paul Groves</PERSON>, a
geographer at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Maryland</ORGANIZATION>. "But they are not
unified. The two center cities have different characters and
are in different political jurisdictions. And much of the
area between the two cities is not densely populated at all."
   Some Washingtonians fear the budget-office decision could
derail the city's effort to win its own major-league baseball
team. If the two cities are part of one metropolitan area,
they say, baseball's paladins could argue that <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>
already has a team: the <ORGANIZATION>Baltimore Orioles</ORGANIZATION>.

@  Problems Loom for Census as Congress Debates

   Though the forms for the <DATE>1990</DATE> census are already at the printers, <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> is contemplating adding a question: Are you an illegal immigrant? 

   The <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION>, as it has in the past, is planning to count all residents of the nation regardless of legal status. 
But the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> already has voted to force the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> to exclude illegal immigrants in preparing tallies for congressional reapportionment. 
A majority of the members of the <ORGANIZATION>House of Representatives</ORGANIZATION> has signaled support. 

   "It is wrong to apportion congressional seats by counting people who would be deported if our immigration laws were enforced," Rep. <PERSON>Thomas Petri</PERSON> (R., <LOCATION>Wis.</LOCATION>) said in a recent <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> debate. 

   Replied Rep. <PERSON>Jim Kolbe</PERSON> (R., <LOCATION>Ariz.</LOCATION>): "A very clear reading of the Constitution says that we shall count all those who are present." 

   Although the debate is often couched in constitutional arguments, it's largely driven by geography. 
<LOCATION>Wisconsin</LOCATION> has few illegal immigrants; <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION> has lots. 

   "It boils down to regional politics," says <PERSON>Arturo Vargas</PERSON>, census-program director for the <ORGANIZATION>Mexican American Legal Defense</ORGANIZATION> and Educational Fund, one of several Hispanic organizations lobbying in favor of counting illegal immigrants. 

   Counting illegal immigrants in <DATE>1990</DATE> is likely to mean one less seat in the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> for <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> and one more for <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, according to the private <ORGANIZATION>Population Reference Bureau</ORGANIZATION>. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION>'s chief antagonist in the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Sen. Richard Shelby</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Ala.</LOCATION>), says seats for <LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION> also are at risk. 
On the other hand, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> could benefit. 

   "Illegal aliens are actually taking representation away from Americans," says <PERSON>David Ray</PERSON>, spokesman for the Federation for <ORGANIZATION>American Immigration Reform</ORGANIZATION>. 

   The <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION>, based on comparisons of its data with figures kept by the <ORGANIZATION>Immigration and Naturalization Service</ORGANIZATION>, estimates that it counted about two million illegal immigrants in <DATE>1980</DATE>, half of them in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>. 
That meant one extra seat in the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> for <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> and one less seat for <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION>. 

   "You end up diluting the vote when you start including illegals," says Rep. <PERSON>Thomas Ridge</PERSON> (R., <LOCATION>Pa.</LOCATION>), who leads the charge against the practice in the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION>. 

   Organizations that represent Hispanics are particularly worried about the congressional campaign. 
They fear that any attempt to ascertain the legal status of respondents will exacerbate difficulties the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> already faces in accurately counting Hispanics and blacks. 

   "As it is, the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> has a tremendous challenge in trying to convince everybody that the census is confidential," <PERSON>Mr. Vargas</PERSON> says. 
"If the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> attempts to ask people their immigration status, that's going to be even harder." 

   The <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> agrees. 
"We tell people: Put your name down on the census form. 
We won't report you to the housing authority {if there are too many occupants}," says <PERSON>Peter Bonpanne</PERSON>, an assistant director. 
"If they see a lot of questions on there about somebody's legal status, that could hurt all kinds of people's participation." 

   Although the 106 million census forms can be reprinted if <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> acts soon, wording a question so that illegal immigrants answer accurately is a challenge, <PERSON>Mr. Bonpanne</PERSON> says. 
The bureau already plans to ask one in six respondents if they are citizens. 
To satisfy congressional critics, it would have to ask everyone that question, and then ask the legal status of anyone who isn't a citizen. 

   Rep. Ridge dismisses the practical problems. 
"We're spending billions on the census, and the only thing we get is a bunch of belly-aching about how difficult it will be," he complains. 
"The primary purpose of the census is to distribute political power . . . not to gather demographic information." 

   The <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>, by a vote of 58-41, added a provision to a pending immigration bill to require the government to subtract illegal immigrants when it comes up with figures used for reapportionment. 

   Because <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> and other populous states that benefit from counting the illegal immigrants have such large delegations in the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> has always presented a bigger obstacle to the opponents of counting such immigrants. 
The <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> did open the door to an amendment to a spending bill that would have barred census takers from "knowingly" counting any illegal immigrants, but the provision was quickly sidetracked on procedural grounds. 

   All sides in the debate predict a lawsuit no matter what <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> does. 
In <DATE>1980</DATE>, a federal appeals court upheld a lower-court decision throwing out a suit that sought to bar the government from counting illegal immigrants. 
A similar suit was dismissed this year when a federal district judge in <LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION> ruled that the states that sued -- <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION> -- couldn't show they had been harmed. 

   The Constitution simply calls for apportioning the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> on the basis of the "the whole number of persons" in each state. 
The Constitution originally called for counting "free persons" and indentured servants, and for counting slaves as three-fifths of a person. 
That was changed with the passage of the 14th Amendment in <DATE>1868</DATE>. 
Only "Indians not taxed" were excluded, but no one has fallen into that category since <DATE>1940</DATE>. 

   Much of the argument in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> turns on the use of the word "person" in references to the census. 
Elsewhere in the Constitution, the framers used the word "citizen." 
They wrote, for instance, that only those who have been "seven years a citizen of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>" can serve in the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION>. 
The word "person" was repeated in the 14th Amendment, which was drafted after the Civil War. 

   Those in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> and at the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> who favor continuing the practice of counting all residents of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> conclude that this language unambiguously resolves the debate. 
Their opponents say the drafters of the Constitution and the 14th Amendment never even considered the concept of an "illegal immigrant," let alone contemplated their current numbers.

<HEAD>The Face of Congress To Be Decided in Key State Races</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The partisan makeup of the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> for the next
decade rests largely with voters in a dozen states this year. A
they choose governors and state legislators, these voters will be
picking the powerbrokers for major redistricting battles.
   The arcane redistricting process draws little attention from
voters. But national political parties are pouring <MONEY>millions of
dollars</MONEY> and advice into state legislative races that often are
ignored in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> except in years ending in zero.
   Redistricting occurs once a decade after the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION>
completes its decennial head count. The population figures are used
to redistribute <ORGANIZATION>U.S. House</ORGANIZATION> seats among the 50 states and to redraw
congressional district lines.
   Some 19 <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> seats are expected to shift as a result of the
<DATE>1990</DATE> Census. Most of them will move from the Democratic-leaning
<ORGANIZATION>Northeast</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Midwest</LOCATION> to the more conservative South and West,
where Republicans have enjoyed success in congressional and
presidential elections but lag behind Democrats at the state level.
   Democrats enter the redistricting process with a decided edge
and hope gains this year will serve as a springboard to <DATE>1992</DATE>, when
the party will try again to wrest control of the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> from
the <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION>.
   Republicans for most of the <DATE>1980s</DATE> touted their ``1991 Plan'' as
the means of escaping their nearly 40 years as minority party in
the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION>. But the <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> now finds itself scrambling to defend its
major redistricting power bases against formidable Democratic
challenges.
   Already, the <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> is threatening to press legal challenges to
partisan plans it expects the Democrats to craft.
   ``We're in position this year to successfully defend most if not
all of our redistricting strengths and then peel off a few if not
more from the Republicans,'' said <PERSON>Tim Dickson</PERSON>, executive director
of the <ORGANIZATION>Democratic Party</ORGANIZATION>'s redistricting arm, Project 500.
   At stake is nothing less than control of the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> through the
year <DATE>2003</DATE>; even modest Democratic gains would cement Republicans as
the minority party for the foreseeable future.
   Party operatives say new computer analyses that mix Census
demographics with voting records will allow anyone with a monopoly
on redistricting to fashion no-lose districts.
   ``You can slice up a state and preordain the results with
incredible accuracy,'' said <PERSON>Ben Ginsberg</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>Republican National
Committee</ORGANIZATION>'s chief counsel.
   The Republicans hoped for big gains after 17 seats shifted from
the Frost Belt to the Sun Belt after the <DATE>1980</DATE> Census. But Democrats
controlled much of the map drawing and ended up with a net gain of
three seats.
   The shifting is called reapportionment, the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> term
for deciding how many of the 435 <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> seats go to each state. Once
that's done the states - in most cases their legislatures - take on
the task of redistricting, literally redrawing the lines of each
congressional district.
   There are 6,144 legislative seats up for election in 46 states.
There are no legislative races this year in <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION>.
   After years of exhaustive research, the parties have narrowed
their targets to a handful to a dozen races in each of the major
redistricting battlegrounds - primarily states that are gaining or
losing seats.
   Fourteen of the shifting seats - and their accompanying
electoral votes in presidential elections - will be gobbled up by
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>.
   In those states, Republicans now control the governor's office
but face stiff challenges this year.
   At the legislative level in those states, only control of the
<ORGANIZATION>Florida Senate</ORGANIZATION> appears in question; Democrats enjoy sizeable
advantages in both chambers of the <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>
legislatures and in the <ORGANIZATION>Florida House</ORGANIZATION>.
   Republicans are mounting an aggressive effort to pick up the
four seats they need to control the <ORGANIZATION>Florida Senate</ORGANIZATION>, which would
give the GOP a voice in redistricting should Republican Gov. <PERSON>Bob
Martinez</PERSON> lose his re-election bid.
   Democrats are cautiously optimistic they will retain their edge.
   The fight in the state destined to be the biggest redistricting
loser, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, focuses on the state <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>, where Democrats need
a net gain of four seats to win a monopoly on redistricting.
   ``If that happens what you will see is blatant political
gerrymandering,'' said the <ORGANIZATION>RNC</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Ginsberg</PERSON>.
   He won't get an argument from Democrats on that point.
   ``The process is inherently political,'' said <ORGANIZATION>Democratic
National Committee</ORGANIZATION> redistricting guru <PERSON>Mark Bohannon</PERSON>. ``It was
designed that way, to benefit winners.''
   President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> has visited <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> to help the <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION>'s state
<ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> effort, and Gov. <PERSON>Mario Cuomo</PERSON> is working hard for the
Democrats. <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> likely will lose three of its 34 <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> seats.
   Democrats also are spending heavily in hopes of gaining
redistricting monopolies in <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>.
They hope to capture the senates in <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> and
both chambers in <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION>, where the <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> has two-seat majorities in
the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>. With the <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> gubernatorial contest leaning
Republican, Democrats also are targeting the <ORGANIZATION>Ohio Senate</ORGANIZATION>, where
they need a gain of three seats to win total control of the state
legislature.
   The party has realistic shots at those goals but faces uphill
odds in trying to erase slim <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> majorities in both chambers of the
<LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION> legislature and the <ORGANIZATION>Colorado House</ORGANIZATION>.
   Democrats find themselves playing defense in the <LOCATION>Florida Senate</LOCATION>
contests as well as in <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>, where Republicans need to gain two
seats to capture the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>. Republicans also are trying to take
over the lower chambers in <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Oregon</LOCATION>, needing a gain
of three seats in each state.
   The <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> contests are
particularly important because each of these states is likely to
lose two congressional seats. Control over redistricting will
decide which incumbents get squeezed.
   The other likely losers are <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>West
Virginia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>. Those
eight states will lose one seat each, according to preliminary
Census data.
   The redistricting winners are led by <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, which should
gain seven seats and see its <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> delegation grow to 52. <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>'s
expected gain of four would bring its <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> delegation to 23. The
likely pickup of three seats by <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> would swell its
representation in the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> to 30.
   Together, these states would supply <PERCENT>24 percent</PERCENT> of <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> members
and hold 105 <ORGANIZATION>Electoral College</ORGANIZATION> votes - <PERCENT>38 percent</PERCENT> of the 270 needed
to win the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION>.
   The other gainers, expected to pick up one seat each, likely
will be <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>.
   Heading into the elections there were just four states - <LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New Hampshire</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>South Dakota</LOCATION> - in which Republicans have
outright control over state government and none of them are
considered major redistricting battlegrounds.
   Democrats, on the other hand, hold the governor's office and
control both legislative chambers in 15 states and at least two of
the three seats at the redistricting table in 23 others.

SENATE VOTES TO PROHIBIT COUNTING OF ILLEGAL ALIENS IN CENSUS

<P>
In a blow to <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> and other states with large immigrant populations, the 
<ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> voted <DATE>Friday</DATE> to bar the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> from counting illegal aliens in 
the <DATE>1990</DATE> population count. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm stunned," said <ORGANIZATION>Santa Ana City Council</ORGANIZATION> member <PERSON>Miguel A. Pulido</PERSON>. Pulido and 
other <LOCATION>Santa Ana</LOCATION> council members say that the <DATE>1980</DATE> census substantially 
under-counted its population at 215,000. The city has been lobbying hard to 
have its illegal alien population -- estimated at 50,000 -- included in the 
<DATE>1990</DATE> count. 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>'s action came on a voice vote, despite arguments from the <ORGANIZATION>Bush 
Administration</ORGANIZATION> and other opponents that it is both unconstitutional and 
unworkable. Just before the voice vote, the senators voted, 50 to 41, against 
killing the proposal to bar aliens from the count. 
</P>
<P>
A <ORGANIZATION>Senate-House conference committee</ORGANIZATION> will decide whether the prohibition against 
including illegal immigrants in the census totals will be retained or dropped 
from a <MONEY>$17.4-billion</MONEY> appropriations bill for the <ORGANIZATION>State</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Justice</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Commerce 
departments</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Would Urge Veto 
</P>
<P>
Even if the prohibition survives, Secretary of Commerce <PERSON>Robert A. Mosbacher</PERSON> has 
said that he would ask President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> to veto any bill that comes to his desk 
with such a provision. 
</P>
<P>
At stake are the number of seats in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> for <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, 
<LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> and other states that will be reapportioned on the basis 
of next year's census. 
</P>
<P>
Federal aid to states also is frequently based on population counts, so 
<MONEY>millions of dollars</MONEY> in grants and other funds made available on a per capita 
basis would be affected. 
</P>
<P>
State officials have said <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> could lose up to <MONEY>$300 million</MONEY> in federal 
aid if illegal aliens were uncounted. <LOCATION>Santa Ana</LOCATION> has estimated its potential 
loss at <MONEY>$2 million</MONEY> a year. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, <PERSON>Pulido</PERSON> and county advocates for poor Latino residents expressed 
concern that the decision would promote fear and intimidation in the community. 
</P>
<P>
In <DATE>1985</DATE>, before the federal immigration reform act, the number of illegal 
aliens in <LOCATION>Orange County</LOCATION> was estimated at 229,000, ranking it just behind <LOCATION>Los 
Angeles County</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, a county official said. There are no current 
estimates. 
</P>
<P>
"For example, we have close to 50,000 people in the city that have qualified 
through the amnesty process for legal residency," <PERSON>Pulido</PERSON> said. "Those 
individuals, when asked or challenged about their status, can be legitimately 
concerned. I think the census's attempt to question them could be misconstrued 
as an attempt by the immigration service to get information." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman <PERSON>John Acosta</PERSON> said he "was saddened" by the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>'s action because 
the city was determined "to count every single person, and I know that (now) 
we're going to to suffer from this monetarily." 
</P>
<P>
But <PERSON>Pulido</PERSON> said he believes the <ORGANIZATION>House of Representatives</ORGANIZATION> will not allow the 
prohibition to survive, especially since it killed an earlier, similar effort. 
</P>
<P>
The issue cuts across partisan lines in the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>, with Minority Leader <PERSON>Bob 
Dole</PERSON> (R-Kan.) arguing against the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> position on grounds that 
including illegal aliens in the census is unfair to American citizens. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Loss of Seats Cited 
</P>
<P>
"Some states will lose congressional seats because of illegal aliens," <PERSON>Dole</PERSON> 
argued. Sen. <PERSON>Thad Cochran</PERSON> (R-Miss.) said that <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION> both lost 
<ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> seats after the <DATE>1980</DATE> Census, and that <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> -- centers 
of illegal immigration -- each gained seats. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is illegal aliens ought to be deported, not counted," <PERSON>Cochran</PERSON> 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. <PERSON>Pete Wilson</PERSON> (R-Calif.) countered that excluding illegal residents from the 
decennial census is unfair to the states that have suffered from a huge influx 
of immigration beyond the legal limits. 
</P>
<P>
"There are enormous additional costs for states who have had a surge of 
population," <PERSON>Wilson</PERSON> said, adding that those states should receive additional 
federal aid to cope with the added problems. 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>'s action would also have an impact on smaller <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> cities 
without substantial Latino populations because census population figures play 
an important role in <ORGANIZATION>Community Development Block Grant</ORGANIZATION> formulas, said <PERSON>Don 
Vestal</PERSON>, Westminster city planner. 
</P>
<P>
Westminster is following a recommendation by the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> to form a 
<ORGANIZATION>Complete Count Committee</ORGANIZATION> of officials and community leaders to help ensure 
cooperation from all city residents. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel that it's in our best interest to get as complete a count as we can," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>Community Development Block Grant</ORGANIZATION> formula, among other things, <PERSON>Vestal</PERSON> said, 
includes use of income figures and percentage of lower income residents in the 
city. "In addition to just counting heads, they're getting economic information 
of the city that will affect us in the future," he added. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Gloria McDonough</PERSON>, director of Abrazar Center, an elderly-assistance center for 
Latinos in <LOCATION>Westminster</LOCATION>, said the senators' action shows they have no 
understanding of the impact of illegal immigration to <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> communities. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether you count them or not, the undocumented residents are still going to 
impact federal dollars in our community. And whether we like it or not they're 
here and here to stay," <PERSON>McDonough</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, representatives from the census office in <LOCATION>Santa Ana</LOCATION> have 
visited such social centers as Abrazar and others and told center staff people 
that they intend to count "everyone, regardless of where they came from," 
<PERSON>McDonough</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
"Their big thing was, 'We do not care about the origins of where these people 
are from, but, more importantly, their impact to local economies,' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
When asked to comment, census officials in <LOCATION>Santa Ana</LOCATION> referred media inquiries 
to the regional office in <LOCATION>Van Nuys</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Adrian Dove</PERSON>, assistant regional director for the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Census in charge of 
outreach, said that despite the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>'s decision, the census bureau "really 
doesn't know how to go about finding who was legal or illegal." 
</P>
<P>
"But we have a mandate to follow that law, and we would have to find out," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of a ban on counting illegal aliens said that a ban is impractical 
because the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> has already printed questionnaires that do not 
contain any question about legality of residence. 
</P>
<P>
For 190 years, said <PERSON>Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan</PERSON> (D-N.Y.), the federal 
government has counted all inhabitants without regard to citizenship in 
accordance with the Constitution's provisions. "Fiddling with the numbers" now 
will destroy confidence in the census results, he added. 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>'s action was sharply criticized by Undersecretary of Commerce 
<PERSON>Michael Darby</PERSON>, but he voiced hope that it would be reversed by a Senate-House 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
"There really is a widespread realization that this would not only be 
unconstitutional but literally impossible," <PERSON>Darby</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
But he added that he is "optimistic, cautiously optimistic," that <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> 
conferees would resist the Senate-approved ban and not force <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> to veto the 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Mario Moreno</PERSON>, head of the Mexican American Legal Defense Fund, said he was 
shocked by the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>'s decision. "It is going to have a dramatic and 
disastrous impact in the Hispanic community," <PERSON>Moreno</PERSON> said. "People are going to 
be discouraged from participating." 
</P>
<P>
A <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> spokesman took a more dispassionate view, however. 
</P>
<P>
"Our position is that we count everybody at their place of residence," said 
bureau spokesman <PERSON>James Gorman</PERSON>. "If <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> passes a law that says we will or 
will not count people, we will do what it says."

total number of legislative seats at issue; Also sent in advance
Oct. 24 as b0772.</NOTE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The partisan makeup of the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> for the next
decade rests largely with voters in a dozen states this year. As
they choose governors and state legislators, these voters will be
picking the power brokers for major redistricting battles.
   The arcane redistricting process draws little attention from
voters. But national political parties are pouring <MONEY>millions of
dollars</MONEY> and advice into state legislative races that often are
ignored in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> except in years ending in zero.
   Redistricting occurs once a decade after the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION>
completes its decennial head count. The population figures are used
to redistribute <ORGANIZATION>U.S. House</ORGANIZATION> seats among the 50 states and to redraw
congressional district lines.
   Some 19 <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> seats are expected to shift as a result of the
<DATE>1990</DATE> Census. Most of them will move from the Democratic-leaning
<ORGANIZATION>Northeast</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Midwest</LOCATION> to the more conservative South and West,
where Republicans have enjoyed success in congressional and
presidential elections but lag behind Democrats at the state level.
   Democrats enter the redistricting process with a decided edge
and hope gains this year will serve as a springboard to <DATE>1992</DATE>, when
the party will try again to wrest control of the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> from
the <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION>.
   Republicans for most of the <DATE>1980s</DATE> touted their ``1991 Plan'' as
the means of escaping their nearly 40 years as minority party in
the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION>. But the <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> now finds itself scrambling to defend its
major redistricting power bases against formidable Democratic
challenges.
   Already, the <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> is threatening to press legal challenges to
partisan plans it expects the Democrats to craft.
   ``We're in position this year to successfully defend most if not
all of our redistricting strengths and then peel off a few if not
more from the Republicans,'' said <PERSON>Tim Dickson</PERSON>, executive director
of the <ORGANIZATION>Democratic Party</ORGANIZATION>'s redistricting arm, Project 500.
   At stake is nothing less than control of the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> through the
year <DATE>2003</DATE>; even modest Democratic gains would cement Republicans as
the minority party for the foreseeable future.
   Party operatives say new computer analyses that mix Census
demographics with voting records will allow anyone with a monopoly
on redistricting to fashion no-lose districts.
   ``You can slice up a state and preordain the results with
incredible accuracy,'' said <PERSON>Ben Ginsberg</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>Republican National
Committee</ORGANIZATION>'s chief counsel.
   The Republicans hoped for big gains after 17 seats shifted from
the Frost Belt to the Sun Belt after the <DATE>1980</DATE> Census. But Democrats
controlled much of the map drawing and ended up with a net gain of
three seats.
   The shifting is called reapportionment, the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> term
for deciding how many of the 435 <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> seats go to each state. Once
that's done the states - in most cases their legislatures - take on
the task of redistricting, literally redrawing the lines of each
congressional district.
   There are 6,144 legislative seats up for election in 46 states.
There are no legislative races this year in <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION>.
   After years of exhaustive research, the parties have narrowed
their targets to a handful to a dozen races in each of the major
redistricting battlegrounds - primarily states that are gaining or
losing seats.
   Fourteen of the shifting seats - and their accompanying
electoral votes in presidential elections - will be gobbled up by
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>.
   In those states, Republicans now control the governor's office
but face stiff challenges this year.
   At the legislative level in those states, only control of the
<ORGANIZATION>Florida Senate</ORGANIZATION> appears in question; Democrats enjoy sizeable
advantages in both chambers of the <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>
legislatures and in the <ORGANIZATION>Florida House</ORGANIZATION>.
   Republicans are mounting an aggressive effort to pick up the
four seats they need to control the <ORGANIZATION>Florida Senate</ORGANIZATION>, which would
give the GOP a voice in redistricting should Republican Gov. <PERSON>Bob
Martinez</PERSON> lose his re-election bid.
   Democrats are cautiously optimistic they will retain their edge.
   The fight in the state destined to be the biggest redistricting
loser, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, focuses on the state <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>, where Democrats need
a net gain of four seats to win a monopoly on redistricting.
   ``If that happens what you will see is blatant political
gerrymandering,'' said the <ORGANIZATION>RNC</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Ginsberg</PERSON>.
   He won't get an argument from Democrats on that point.
   ``The process is inherently political,'' said <ORGANIZATION>Democratic
National Committee</ORGANIZATION> redistricting guru <PERSON>Mark Bohannon</PERSON>. ``It was
designed that way, to benefit winners.''
   President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> has visited <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> to help the <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION>'s state
<ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> effort, and Gov. <PERSON>Mario Cuomo</PERSON> is working hard for the
Democrats. <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> likely will lose three of its 34 <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> seats.
   Democrats also are spending heavily in hopes of gaining
redistricting monopolies in <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>.
They hope to capture the senates in <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> and
both chambers in <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION>, where the <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> has two-seat majorities in
the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>. With the <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> gubernatorial contest leaning
Republican, Democrats also are targeting the <ORGANIZATION>Ohio Senate</ORGANIZATION>, where
they need a gain of three seats to win total control of the state
legislature.
   The party has realistic shots at those goals but faces uphill
odds in trying to erase slim <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> majorities in both chambers of the
<LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION> legislature and the <ORGANIZATION>Colorado House</ORGANIZATION>.
   Democrats find themselves playing defense in the <LOCATION>Florida Senate</LOCATION>
contests as well as in <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>, where Republicans need to gain two
seats to capture the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>. Republicans also are trying to take
over the lower chambers in <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Oregon</LOCATION>, needing a gain
of three seats in each state.
   The <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> contests are
particularly important because each of these states is likely to
lose two congressional seats. Control over redistricting will
decide which incumbents get squeezed.
   The other likely losers are <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>West
Virginia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>. Those
eight states will lose one seat each, according to preliminary
Census data.
   The redistricting winners are led by <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, which should
gain seven seats and see its <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> delegation grow to 52. <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>'s
expected gain of four would bring its <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> delegation to 23. The
likely pickup of three seats by <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> would swell its
representation in the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> to 30.
   Together, these states would supply <PERCENT>24 percent</PERCENT> of <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> members
and hold 105 <ORGANIZATION>Electoral College</ORGANIZATION> votes - <PERCENT>38 percent</PERCENT> of the 270 needed
to win the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION>.
   The other gainers, expected to pick up one seat each, likely
will be <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>.
   Heading into the elections there were just four states - <LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New Hampshire</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>South Dakota</LOCATION> - in which Republicans have
outright control over state government and none of them are
considered major redistricting battlegrounds.
   Democrats, on the other hand, hold the governor's office and
control both legislative chambers in 15 states and at least two of
the three seats at the redistricting table in 23 others.

<HEAD>Dinkins Says Census Bureau Missed 1 Million New Yorkers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CATHERINE CROCKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor <PERSON>David Dinkins</PERSON> has accused the <ORGANIZATION>Census
Bureau</ORGANIZATION> of skipping one out of every 13 housing units and missing up
to 1 million residents in its preliminary <DATE>1990</DATE> count of the city's
population.
   <PERSON>Dinkins</PERSON> said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> the city is filing a challenge to the
government's figures. Federal aid and representation in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>
are determined by the Census count.
   ``The <DATE>1990</DATE> undercount could cost us up to <MONEY>$1 billion</MONEY> in lost
federal aid, or <MONEY>$150</MONEY> for each man, woman and child living in our
city,'' he said. <PERSON>Dinkins</PERSON> also said the count could cost the city at
least one seat in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>.
   The mayor said the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> failed to count 254,534 housing
units, undercounting the city's population by 800,000 to 1 million.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Bureau</ORGANIZATION> counted 7.033 million people in the city. The
<ORGANIZATION>Department of City Planning</ORGANIZATION> estimates 8 million people live in the
city.
   ``It is statistically stunning and demographically absurd for
the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> to claim that a city whose resident birth rate
has risen by at least <PERCENT>23 percent</PERCENT> and which has welcomed more than
800,000 legal immigrants to its shores during the past decade has
actually lost population,'' the mayor said.
   The city was given 15 business days to review the <ORGANIZATION>Bureau</ORGANIZATION>'s <DATE>1990</DATE>
preliminary figures. It did so by analyzing data from the city, <ORGANIZATION>Con
Edison</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>New York Telephone Co.</ORGANIZATION>, as well as consulting
surveys, atlases and aerial photographs.
   In his letter to <PERSON>Sheila Grimm</PERSON>, regional director of the <ORGANIZATION>Census
Bureau</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Dinkins</PERSON> asked that the bureau review some 11,900 city
blocks - approximately <PERCENT>43 percent</PERCENT> of the city's more than 28,000
residential blocks.
   The bureau has said it would take 10 days to review the city's
challenge.
   In a three-block area in one section of <LOCATION>Queens</LOCATION>, the city counted
567 housing units in what it said was a neighborhood of one-and
two-family homes; the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> counted zero units.
   Neighborhoods with minority populations, in general, tended to
be undercounted by the bureau, said <PERSON>Richard Schaffer</PERSON>, director of
the <ORGANIZATION>Department of City Planning</ORGANIZATION> and chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>City Planning
Commission</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>Dinkins</PERSON> said the <DATE>1980</DATE> undercount, put by the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> at
450,000, cost <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION> some <MONEY>$675 million</MONEY> in federal aid during
the ensuing 10 years.
