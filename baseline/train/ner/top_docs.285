<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   <ORGANIZATION>Rio Grande Industries Inc.</ORGANIZATION> received government
approval <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> for its <MONEY>$1.2 billion</MONEY> purchase of the <ORGANIZATION>Southern
Pacific Railroad</ORGANIZATION>, one of the nation's oldest rail lines with track
stretching from <LOCATION>Oregon</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION>.
   Southern <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION>, which has 15,000 miles of track, will retain
its name and incorporate into its operations the smaller <ORGANIZATION>Denver &amp;
Rio Grande Western Railroad</ORGANIZATION> once the purchase is completed, company
officials said.
   By a 4-0 vote, the <ORGANIZATION>Interstate Commerce Commission</ORGANIZATION> gave approval
for the railroad's sale by its parent <ORGANIZATION>Sante Fe Southern Pacific
Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, to <ORGANIZATION>Rio Grande Industries</ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of the Denver-based
<ORGANIZATION>Anschutz Corp</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>Philip Anschutz</PERSON>, owner of the privately held company, told
reporters he intends to concentrate on reducing <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION>'s
debts, partly through the sale of some of its real estate holdings,
and modernize the railroad's equipment and facilities.
   ``We will be in the railroad business, first and foremost,''
said <PERSON>Anschutz</PERSON>, whose background is in energy.
   <PERSON>Anschutz</PERSON>, who has a reputation of being reclusive, acknowledged
that he had never before held a news conference, but he said he
wanted to meet with reporters to set to rest unfounded ``rumors,''
including one that sought the <LOCATION>Southern Pacific</LOCATION> to break it up and
make a quick profit.
   ``It's very important that this company be kept together,'' he
said.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Anschutz Corp.</ORGANIZATION> purchased <ORGANIZATION>Rio Grande Industries</ORGANIZATION> four years
ago.
   <PERSON>William Holtman</PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Rio Grande Industries</ORGANIZATION>, expressed
confidence in <PERSON>Anschutz</PERSON>'s devotion to railroading. ``He's a
long-term player,'' <PERSON>Holtman</PERSON> said of <PERSON>Anschutz</PERSON>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION> said the merger of the <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Denver &amp;
Rio Grande Western</ORGANIZATION> railroads would have the best competitive
benefits and be in the public interest. The merger was recommended
by both the <ORGANIZATION>Justice Department</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Transportation Department</ORGANIZATION>.
   The commission last year ordered the Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe
Southern Pacific Corp.</ORGANIZATION> to divest itself of either the <ORGANIZATION>Southern
Pacific</ORGANIZATION> or the <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> railroads after it rejected a proposal to
merge the two rail lines. The company chose to sell the <ORGANIZATION>Southern
Pacific</ORGANIZATION>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION>'s stock has been held in a trust for nearly
five years pending the outcome of the battle over who should own
the railroad.
   ``We look forward to completing the sale, getting out of
trusteeship and moving forward again with a clear idea of <ORGANIZATION>Southern
Pacific</ORGANIZATION>'s future course and direction,'' said <PERSON>Denman McNear</PERSON>,
chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific Transportation Co</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>Anschutz</PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION>'s management team would be
chosen from among the senior managers of both the <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION>
and the <ORGANIZATION>Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western</ORGANIZATION>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Southern</ORGANIZATION> reached agreement with <ORGANIZATION>Rio Grande Industries</ORGANIZATION>
on the sale last <DATE>February</DATE>, but when permission for the transaction
was sought from the <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION>, another railroad company, <ORGANIZATION>Kansas City
Southern Industries</ORGANIZATION>, objected and asked that it be allowed to buy
the railroad.
   But the <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION> in a series of votes <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> turned its back on the
<LOCATION>Kansas City Southern</LOCATION> proposal. One concern of the <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION> was <ORGANIZATION>Kansas
City Southern</ORGANIZATION>'s financial outlook in light of a <MONEY>$600 million</MONEY> court
judgment that is under appeal.
   The judgment stems from antitrust and contract violations
involving a coal-slurry pipeline project in <LOCATION>South Dakota</LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION>Kansas
City Southern</ORGANIZATION> had argued that the judgment would not affect its
ability to finance the <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> purchase.
   <ORGANIZATION>Kansas City Southern</ORGANIZATION> could challenge the <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION> ruling in court,
but the company's president and chief executive officer, <PERSON>Landon
Rowland</PERSON>, said no decision has been made on what the next step, if
any, would be.
   ``We're not ruling out anything,'' <PERSON>Rowland</PERSON> told reporters after
the <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION> vote.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION>, which is rich in history, operates up and
down the <LOCATION>West Coast</LOCATION> and along the southern tier of the country with
tracks stretching from <LOCATION>Portland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ore.</LOCATION>, through central <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>
and across the <LOCATION>Southwest</LOCATION> as far east as <LOCATION>New Orleans</LOCATION>. It also
operates lines from <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Ogden</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION>, where it links up
with the <ORGANIZATION>Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western</ORGANIZATION>, and from <LOCATION>St. Louis</LOCATION> to the
<ORGANIZATION>Gulf Coast</ORGANIZATION>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Denver &amp; Rio Grande</ORGANIZATION> runs along a central corridor from <LOCATION>Ogden</LOCATION>
to <LOCATION>St. Louis</LOCATION>.
   Both railroads have been closely intertwined with the history of
the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION>, helping to bring in settlers, miners and industry.
   Southern Pacific's founders helped drive the golden spike in
<LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION> in <DATE>1869</DATE>, linking the country's first transcontinental rail
line. Two years later, the <ORGANIZATION>Denver &amp; Rio Grande</ORGANIZATION> ran its first train
from <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Colorado Springs</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Anschutz</PERSON> said the new railroad ``will operate under the banner
of <LOCATION>Southern Pacific</LOCATION>,'' although within the company the <ORGANIZATION>Denver &amp; Rio
Grande Western</ORGANIZATION> will continue to maintain its own identity.
   He said he decided to retain the <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> name because
it is by far the larger of the two railroads and probably better
known. ``Last of all, I like the name,'' he added.

   The <ORGANIZATION>Interstate Commerce Commission</ORGANIZATION> today
unanimously approved the sale of the <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific Railroad to
Rio Grande Industries</ORGANIZATION>, creating a 15,000-mile rail system that
covers 15 states from <LOCATION>Portland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ore.</LOCATION>, to <LOCATION>New Orleans</LOCATION>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Rio Grande Industries</ORGANIZATION> has agreed to buy the <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION>
from <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp.</ORGANIZATION> for <MONEY>$1.2 billion</MONEY>.

<TEXT>
   The <ORGANIZATION>Interstate Commerce Commission</ORGANIZATION>, ending one of the longest-running sagas in modern railroad history, refused to reconsider its <DATE>1986</DATE> rejection of the proposed merger of the <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> railroads. 

   The 4-1 vote underscored the commission's continued strong concerns about the potentially anti-competitive nature of the merger, which would have produced the nation's third-largest railroad, with more than 25,000 miles of track in the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Southwest</ORGANIZATION>. 

   The action will force <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, the Chicago-based parent company of both railroads, to sell at least one of the railroads. 
The corporation was created in <DATE>1983</DATE> when <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Industries Inc.</ORGANIZATION> merged with <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific Co.</ORGANIZATION>, and it has operated the two railroads separately while awaiting <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION> approval. 
Last <DATE>July</DATE>, the commission rejected the merger. 

   The <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION>, in refusing to review that decision yesterday, gave <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> 90 days to submit a divestiture plan. 
It is the first time in recent years that the commission ordered such a divestiture. 
The company will have up to two years to sell one of the railroads, according to commission staff members. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION>'s stock rose sharply yesterday, closing at <MONEY>$50</MONEY>, up <MONEY>$3.75</MONEY> in <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading. 
It was the most actively traded issue on the exchange, with 4.9 million shares changing hands. 
In addition, <ORGANIZATION>Standard &amp; Poor's Corp.</ORGANIZATION> put the company's debt ratings under review and <ORGANIZATION>Moody's Investors Service Inc.</ORGANIZATION> said it will continue an existing review. 

   Railroad industry analysts say the collapse of the merger is likely to touch off a buying spree for portions of one or both of the railroads and could lead to creation of the nation's first coast-to-coast rail system if an <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> railroad emerges as the buyer. 

   At a news conference immediately after the <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION> vote, <PERSON>Landon Rowland</PERSON>, chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION>Kansas City Southern Industries Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, said his company would make an offer within the next 60 days to buy <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION>. 
Hours later, <ORGANIZATION>Burlington Northern Railroad</ORGANIZATION> said it was "interested in acquiring segments of the <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> or the <LOCATION>Santa</LOCATION> Fe or both." 
In addition, some <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> managers and a rail union official separately raised the possibility of buyouts. 

   <PERSON>John Reed</PERSON>, chairman and chief executive of <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, at the news conference expressed disappointment about the commission decision, but said the company wouldn't appeal it in court. 

   "Our employees have been held in suspense long enough," he said. 
"We just have to get on with our business." 
The company, he added, plans a major realignment involving a renewed focus on its "core businesses" of natural resources, petroleum and transportation, and the sale of a number of other subsidiaries. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Reed</PERSON>, in response to a question, denied that the company already has decided to sell <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION>, which remains weaker than <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> despite recent signs of improvement. 
"We haven't made any decision as to which railroad will be disposed of," he said. 
He added that it was "conceivable" both railroads would be sold, particularly if management failed to win more concessions from labor. 

   However, industry sources doubted that <PERSON>Mr. Reed</PERSON>, who headed the <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> for 16 years, would agree easily to sell that railroad. 
And <PERSON>Richard Kilroy</PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>Railway Labor Executives Association</ORGANIZATION>, a group representing rail labor unions, dismissed his statement on labor concessions as "posturing." 

   Analysts estimate the value of the two railroads is as much as <MONEY>$3 billion</MONEY>. 

   The commission, in upholding its earlier rejection of the merger, overruled a staff recommendation to reopen the case. 
The staff argued that a review of the case was needed because of the numerous agreements over track rights that <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> made with other railroads to ameliorate competitive problems. 

   But the majority of the commissioners dismissed that argument. 
"I'm not convinced that the anti-competitive effects we identified in the initial decision have been adequately remedied," said Commissioner <PERSON>Malcolm Sterrett</PERSON>. 
Vice Chairman <PERSON>Paul Lamboley</PERSON> agreed: "I don't think there is really a change at all." 

   Some analysts believe that railroad mergers are a necessity for the railroad industry to survive, and that closing or substantially narrowing that option could cripple the industry's chances. 

   By contrast, the <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION>'s denial was greeted with enthusiasm at <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION>. 
Many of the high-ranking executives there had given up support for the merger long ago. 
At a staff meeting to draft a news release on the commission's decision, one top manager jokingly crossed out the word "disappointed" and scribbled in "tickled" to describe <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION>'s reaction. 

   After several lean years, the <LOCATION>Southern Pacific</LOCATION> is showing some signs of rebirth, due in large part to a stabilized customer base and lower costs for fuel and labor. 
The company showed a profit in the <DATE>first quarter</DATE>, usually the quarter with the lowest railroad traffic of the year. 

   The railroad also recently completed a <MONEY>$1.3 billion</MONEY> track improvement program and opened a container transfer facility outside <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> to handle the growing number of merchandise containers coming off ships. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Mr. Reed</PERSON>, in describing the company's plans for realignment, said the following subsidiaries would be offered for sale: <PERSON>Robert E. McKee</PERSON>, a general contractor; <ORGANIZATION>Bankers Leasing &amp; Financial Corp.</ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Pacific Timber Co.</ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION>Gulf Central Pipeline Co.</ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION>Chaparral Pipeline</ORGANIZATION>; and <ORGANIZATION>Black Mesa Pipeline</ORGANIZATION>. 

   The company, whose most valuable holdings are its <MONEY>$5 billion</MONEY> of real estate assets, also signaled that it is willing to sell some of its fully developed properties. 
These include the <ORGANIZATION>Pacific Design Center</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>McDonnell Douglas Center</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif</LOCATION>. 

   On the possible sale of either the <LOCATION>Santa</LOCATION> Fe or <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> railroads, the most intriguing possibility is that of the creation of a transcontinental rail carrier by an <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> railroad bidder. 
The benefits of such a combination appear to be growing, reflecting the boom in coast-to-coast shipments of containerized imports from the <LOCATION>Far East</LOCATION>. 

   The big <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> railroads, <ORGANIZATION>Norfolk Southern Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Consolidated Rail Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>CSX Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, declined comment. 
But <DATE>last May</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Norfolk Southern</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Arnold McKinnon</PERSON> told analysts that "we'll look" if one of the Western railroads became available. 

   Creating a transcontinental rail system faces some problems. 
Some rail executives long have dismissed as minimal the potential cost savings and traffic gains from such combinations. 
In addition, the formation of a coast-to-coast railroad likely would spur competitors to make similar combinations, and those proposed combinations would face regulatory hurdles, including <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION> review.

<TEXT>
   The <ORGANIZATION>Interstate Commerce Commission</ORGANIZATION> heard from
two railroads <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> that are vying for the purchase of the
<ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific Railroad</ORGANIZATION>, which is on the auction block because of
a failed merger attempt last year.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Pacific Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, had agreed to sell its <ORGANIZATION>Southern
Pacific</ORGANIZATION> subsidiary to <ORGANIZATION>Rio Grande Industries Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, the parent
company of the <ORGANIZATION>Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western Railroad</ORGANIZATION> for <MONEY>$1.02
billion</MONEY>.
   But the deal, which requires <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION> approval, has run into strong
opposition from <ORGANIZATION>Kansas City Southern Industries</ORGANIZATION>, operator of the
<ORGANIZATION>Kansas City Southern Railroad</ORGANIZATION>, which has offered <MONEY>$1.25 billion</MONEY> for
the 13,000-mile rail system that stretches from <LOCATION>Kansas City</LOCATION> to the
<LOCATION>West Coast</LOCATION>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION> heard from both railroads <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> as it tries to
determine which buyer to choose, or whether it might approve both
applications and allow <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> to choose.
   A decision is expected next month.
   <PERSON>Samuel Freeman</PERSON>, an attorney for <ORGANIZATION>Rio Grande Industries</ORGANIZATION>, told the
<ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION> in formal arguments that the company is in better financial
position to buy the <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> than is <LOCATION>Kansas City Southern</LOCATION>.
   ``The request (by <LOCATION>Kansas City Southern</LOCATION> that it be allowed to buy
the railroad) is unprecedented and unwarranted,'' he said.
   Rio Grande officials noted that <ORGANIZATION>Kansas City Southern</ORGANIZATION> faces a
possible <MONEY>$600 million</MONEY> settlement from a legal entanglement that
grew out of its role in the a failure of a coal slurry pipeline
project.
   <ORGANIZATION>Kansas City Southern</ORGANIZATION>, however, maintained before the <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION> that it
would be the most fit buyer of the <LOCATION>Southern Pacific</LOCATION>, arguing that
it is offering more money and plans to invest <PERCENT>20 percent</PERCENT> more funds
in the railroad than the <LOCATION>Rio Grande</LOCATION>.
   ``We are committed to the acquisition and rehabilitation of the
<ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON>Landon Rowland</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Kansas City
Southern Industries</ORGANIZATION>. He said the company would invest more than <MONEY>$4
billion</MONEY> in the railroad over a five-year period.
   <ORGANIZATION>Kansas City Southern</ORGANIZATION> has accused the <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Pacific Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, of
favoring the lower <ORGANIZATION>Rio Grande</ORGANIZATION> bid because the merger would benefit
the <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Railroad</ORGANIZATION>, the other rail line owned by <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe
Pacific Corp</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>Jerome Donohoe</PERSON>, representing <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Pacific</ORGANIZATION>, said the company
has a binding contract with <ORGANIZATION>Rio Grande</ORGANIZATION> and could not complete the
sale this year if the <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION> were to choose <ORGANIZATION>Kansas City Southern</ORGANIZATION>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> was put up for sale under an <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION>
divestiture order after the <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION> <DATE>last year</DATE> rejected a planned merger
of the <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> with the <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION>.

   The <ORGANIZATION>Interstate Commerce Commission</ORGANIZATION> is expected today to approve the sale of <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific Transportation Co.</ORGANIZATION> to <ORGANIZATION>Rio Grande Industries Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, closing a five-year controversy over the fate of one of the nation's oldest railroads. 

   The commission, meeting in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION>, is expected to approve the sale despite strenuous objections from <ORGANIZATION>Kansas City Southern Industries Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, which has offered <MONEY>$1.25 billion</MONEY> in cash and notes for <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION>. 
A commission official said the <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION> is concerned about how a court judgment of as much as <MONEY>$600 million</MONEY> against <ORGANIZATION>Kansas City Southern</ORGANIZATION> in the state of <LOCATION>South Dakota</LOCATION> will affect that company's financial outlook. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Kansas City Southern</ORGANIZATION> is appealing that judgment, which stems from antitrust and contract violations involving a coal-slurry pipeline project in <LOCATION>South Dakota</LOCATION>. 
A <LOCATION>Sioux Falls</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>S.D.</LOCATION>, federal judge last <DATE>Friday</DATE> said he planned to issue an order barring <ORGANIZATION>Kansas City Southern</ORGANIZATION> from completing any purchase of <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> until the <LOCATION>South Dakota</LOCATION> case is resolved. 

   In <DATE>December</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION>'s parent, <ORGANIZATION>Chicago-based Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, agreed to sell the rail unit to <LOCATION>Rio Grande</LOCATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>Denver-based Anschutz Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, for <MONEY>$1.2 billion</MONEY>. 
But the sale couldn't be finalized without the approval of the <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION>, which rules on whether such mergers are "in the public interest" and must insure they don't pose anti-competitive problems. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Kansas City Southern</ORGANIZATION> has tried since then to prevent the sale, arguing that it's willing to invest more money in <LOCATION>Southern Pacific</LOCATION> than <LOCATION>Rio Grande</LOCATION>, and would therefore make <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> a more viable competitor among railroads in the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Kansas City Southern</ORGANIZATION> maintains the <MONEY>$600 million</MONEY> judgment it has been ordered to pay in <LOCATION>South Dakota</LOCATION> would have no effect on its plans for <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION>. 

   <PERSON>Landon Rowland</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Kansas City Southern</ORGANIZATION>'s president and chief executive officer, said a decision in favor of <LOCATION>Rio Grande</LOCATION> at today's <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION> hearing would be "very disappointing." 
He left open the possibility that his company still may try to block the sale in the courts if it fails before the <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION>. 

   The fate of the <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION>, which traces its beginnings to the first transcontinental railroad, has been in abeyance since <DATE>December 1983</DATE>, when it was acquired by <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> had hoped to merge <LOCATION>Southern Pacific</LOCATION>, which is based in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, with its other rail unit, the <ORGANIZATION>Atchison Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway</ORGANIZATION>. 
But after four years of hearings and rehearings, the <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION> rejected that proposal and ordered <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> to sell off one of its rail units.

   <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp.</ORGANIZATION>'s revised plan to create the nation's second-longest railroad still faces opposition from some competitors and regulators. 

   The plan, which was filed last week with the <ORGANIZATION>Interstate Commerce Commission</ORGANIZATION>, details the concessions the transportation and natural resources giant is willing to grant to four Western railroads. 
The railroads had objected to its plans to merge its two railway units: the <LOCATION>Atchison</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway Co.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific Transportation Co</ORGANIZATION>. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> is attempting to use the concessions to convince the <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION> to reopen hearings on its three-year struggle to merge the two railroads. 
The <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION> blocked the merger last <DATE>July</DATE> on grounds that the combined railroads would have monopolized traffic on the <LOCATION>Pacific Coast</LOCATION> as well as between <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Gulf Coast</ORGANIZATION>. 

   According to the filing, <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> is agreeing to let the four railroads use hundreds of miles of its track in return for similar rights. 
The arrangements strengthen the four railroads, which may in turn spur their competitors to try to derail the complicated merger plan. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Burlington Northern Railroad Co.</ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest railroad, said <DATE>Friday</DATE> it opposes the revised merger proposal because, among other things, it would grant its biggest Western competitor, <ORGANIZATION>Union Pacific Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, access to the southwestern <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> 
"At the least, the anti-competitive problems don't go away, and it gives <ORGANIZATION>Union Pacific</ORGANIZATION> the upper hand in the Southern corridor," said <ORGANIZATION>Burlington Northern</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>Mike Wenninger</PERSON>. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> has reached agreements with the <ORGANIZATION>Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad Co.</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Texas Mexican Railway Co</ORGANIZATION>. 
The company said a final agreement with the <ORGANIZATION>Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western Railroad Co.</ORGANIZATION> is snagged over "narrow, discrete issues" that it suggests could be settled by the <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION> or arbitration. 
The agreement would allow the <ORGANIZATION>Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western</ORGANIZATION> to lease track in <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Oregon</LOCATION>. 

   The <ORGANIZATION>Justice Department</ORGANIZATION> said it is looking at the concessions to determine whether they solve the anti-competitive problems raised by the original combination. 
"We are skeptical," said <PERSON>James R. Weiss</PERSON>, chief of the antitrust division's transportation, energy and agriculture section. 
"Trying to resolve (anti-competitive problems) through these fixes is difficult to do," he said. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Transportation Department</ORGANIZATION> has supported the merger of the railway units, which would encompass more than 25,000 miles of track from the <LOCATION>Mississippi River</LOCATION> across the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Southwest</ORGANIZATION>. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Kansas City Southern Railway Co.</ORGANIZATION> has opposed the revised merger plan because it wants to buy the Southern Pacific system. 
<ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> will have to divest itself of one of the railroad units if the <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION> rejection stands. 

   This complicated railroad battle was touched off in <DATE>1983</DATE> when <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Industries Inc.</ORGANIZATION> merged with <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific Co.</ORGANIZATION> in a <MONEY>$6.4 billion</MONEY> transaction. 
The energy and natural resources operations of the two companies were immediately combined but the railroad units were kept separate pending <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION> approval. 
<ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> is managed independently through a trust. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> said it has drummed up support to reopen the <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION> hearings from, among others, the governors of 12 states and from 1,700 companies that ship goods over the affected railroad lines. 
Interested parties have three weeks from <DATE>last Thursday</DATE> to file comments on <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION>'s merger petition. 

   In trading on the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> <DATE>Friday</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> shares closed at <MONEY>$36.625</MONEY>, up <MONEY>$1.25</MONEY>. 

   The concessions are an about-face for <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION>'s chairman, <PERSON>John J. Schmidt</PERSON>. 
Prior to the rejection of the merger proposal by the <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION>, he had maintained that any concessions could severely damage the viability of the merger. 
Now the company is saying the concessions improve the merger. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON>Mr. Schmidt</PERSON> wasn't available to comment. 
A company spokesman said the trackage-rights swaps and lease agreements with the four railroads would allow the merged units to take shortcuts and trim maintenance costs, among other things. 
The petition estimates that <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> would save itself about <MONEY>$295 million</MONEY> annually by merging the units this way. 
Under the old plan, the company thought it would save about <MONEY>$288 million</MONEY> annually.

   The <ORGANIZATION>Interstate Commerce Commission</ORGANIZATION> approved the <MONEY>$1.02 billion</MONEY> sale of <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific Railroad to Denver-based Rio Grande Industries Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, spurning a competing bid from <ORGANIZATION>Kansas City Southern Industries Inc</ORGANIZATION>. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Rio Grande</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Philip Anschutz</PERSON> said that company's railroad unit, <ORGANIZATION>Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western Railroad</ORGANIZATION>, will be combined with <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> and run under the <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> name. 

   The new rail system, with 15,000 miles of track, will be the fifth largest in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, covering 15 states west of the <LOCATION>Mississippi River</LOCATION>. 
It will be based in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, as <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> is now, and will have a major regional office in <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION>. 

   In a 20-minute session, the commission voted 4-0 to approve <LOCATION>Rio Grande</LOCATION>'s application to buy <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> from Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and 4-0 to reject <ORGANIZATION>Kansas City Southern's</ORGANIZATION>. 
<PERSON>Heather Gradison</PERSON>, chairman of the commission, said the transaction would "produce substantial public benefits" without "discernible harms to competition or to essential railroad service." 

   <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION> member <PERSON>Paul Lamboley</PERSON> appeared to speak for his colleagues in articulating a major argument against the <ORGANIZATION>Kansas City Southern</ORGANIZATION> bid: a pending court judgment against that <LOCATION>Kansas City</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mo.</LOCATION>, railroad company of as much as <MONEY>$600 million</MONEY>. 
He said the prospect of the judgment clouds the company's financial outlook and would delay completion of any <ORGANIZATION>Kansas City Southern</ORGANIZATION> purchase of <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION>. 

   The judgment against <ORGANIZATION>Kansas City Southern</ORGANIZATION> stems from antitrust and contract violations involving a coal-slurry pipeline project in <LOCATION>South Dakota</LOCATION>. 
The railroad is appealing the judgment, but a federal judge last week said he would bar <ORGANIZATION>Kansas City Southern</ORGANIZATION> from completing a purchase of <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> until the case is resolved. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Kansas City Southern</ORGANIZATION>'s bid for <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> totaled <MONEY>$1.25 billion</MONEY> in cash and debentures. 
<ORGANIZATION>Rio Grande</ORGANIZATION>'s bid was all cash. 

   Meanwhile, <PERSON>David Berger</PERSON>, an attorney in <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION>, is seeking certification from a state court in <LOCATION>Wilmington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Del.</LOCATION>, to press a class-action suit on behalf of <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Southern</ORGANIZATION> shareholders. 
The suit would charge that the company's management breached its fiduciary duties in accepting the lower bid and would seek damages of at least <MONEY>$20 million</MONEY>. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Kansas City Southern</ORGANIZATION> yesterday criticized the commission's decision to approve its rival's bid, saying, "The biggest loser was the public interest." 
The railroad contended that it planned to spend <MONEY>$4 billion</MONEY> more on <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> over the next five years than <ORGANIZATION>Rio Grande</ORGANIZATION> plans to spend. 
<ORGANIZATION>Kansas City Southern</ORGANIZATION> said its bid for <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> remains "on the table." 

   The commission vote apparently ends one of the longest-running sagas in the railroad business, over the future of <LOCATION>Southern Pacific</LOCATION>. 
In late <DATE>1983</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Industries</ORGANIZATION>, which owns <ORGANIZATION>Atchison Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway</ORGANIZATION>, bought <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific Co.</ORGANIZATION>, owner of <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific Railroad</ORGANIZATION>. 
The parent companies merged their non-rail assets but operated their railroads separately pending <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION> approval. 

   Last year, the commission, citing threats to competition, vetoed the rail merger and ordered <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> to sell one of its railroads.

@  Trains Double Up to Get Truck Business

   The proliferation of double-stack container trains is igniting a rate war between truckers and railroads, benefiting shippers with lower freight rates. 

   More than 100 double-stack trains, which carry one container loaded above another, now ply the nation's long-haul east-west freight routes each week, compared with a handful five years ago. 
Double-stack rates between <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> dropped <PERCENT>15%</PERCENT> in the past 12 months, as freight-hauling capacity continued to grow amid a slowdown in demand. 
Some analysts expect rates to fall further when additional trains are launched. 

   The transcontinental freight routes have become "extremely competitive," says <PERSON>John Koons</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Country Wide Transport Services Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a truck company. 
Double-stack trains are "taking a lot of freight that used to be routed via trucks." 

   More broadly, the double-stack trains are "increasing the efficiency of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> freight transportation and the competitiveness of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> manufacturers," says <PERSON>Gerard McCullough</PERSON>, deputy director of transportation studies at <ORGANIZATION>Massachusetts Institute of Technology</ORGANIZATION>. 

   The rate cutting affects long-distance east-west freight flows of more than <MONEY>$10 billion</MONEY> a year. 
Some analysts estimate that the industrywide rate drops spurred by double-stack competition are saving <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> consumers between <MONEY>$500 million</MONEY> and <MONEY>$1 billion</MONEY> a year. 

   Among the biggest rate cuts are ones on the busy <LOCATION>Chicago-Los Angeles</LOCATION> corridor, where rates for some carriers plunged from about <MONEY>$1,500</MONEY> for some of the bigger containers two years ago to <MONEY>$1,200</MONEY> to <MONEY>$1,000</MONEY> now. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Proctor &amp; Gamble Co.</ORGANIZATION> recently shifted some of its business away from trucks to double-stack trains because of the rate cuts and improvements in double-stack service. 
The company now ships 20 container loads a week of potato chips, peanut butter and liquid detergent from its <LOCATION>Midwest</LOCATION> plants to the <LOCATION>West Coast</LOCATION> by rail. 
In response to shipper defections, some truckers are slashing rates. 
Others are courting shippers further away from the major double-stack terminals. 
A few are fleeing transcontinental routes, focusing instead on shorter regional deliveries. 

   Country Wide is moving its headquarters from <LOCATION>Pomona</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, where double-stack competition is keen, to <LOCATION>Knoxville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Tenn</LOCATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>MNX Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>St. Joseph</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mo.</LOCATION>, trucker, is redeploying trucks to less competitive routes in the Southeast. 
Recently, <ORGANIZATION>MNX</ORGANIZATION> bought a shipping broker to gain access to the fast-growing double-stack market. 
Another trucker, <ORGANIZATION>CRST Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Cedar Rapids</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>, shelved plans to buy 50 more trucks, blaming rate declines. 

   "We're barely making money," says <PERSON>John Smith</PERSON>, president of CRST. 
"We're doing everything we can to keep costs down." 

   For decades the nation's railroads seemed helpless against trucking companies that siphoned off their most lucrative freight, leaving the rails with low-rated bulk traffic. 
They fought back with piggyback -- transporting highway trailers on flatcars -- but managed to win freight mainly from their own boxcars. 

   Double-stacks represent the "first concrete example of a new rail intermodal technology taking traffic off the highway," says <PERSON>Lee Lane</PERSON>, intermodal executive director of the <ORGANIZATION>Association of American Railroads</ORGANIZATION>. 
By some estimates, double-stacks are capturing <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> freight shipments of more than <MONEY>$100 million</MONEY> a year from trucks. 

   By stacking two containers on special rail cars, railroads nearly double train capacity and cut rail costs <PERCENT>25%</PERCENT>. 
The double-stack trains carry containers in low-slung, bathtub-shaped wells that provide a smoother ride than piggyback trains. 

   <ORGANIZATION>American President Cos.</ORGANIZATION>, an <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION>, Calif.-based ocean ship line, launched the first coast-to-coast double-stack train in <DATE>1984</DATE>. 
It was originally designed to speed international cargo off the company's ships on the <LOCATION>West Coast</LOCATION> to inland destinations. 
But to balance the heavy flow of Asian imports on its eastbound trains, the company solicited domestic freight to fill containers that would have returned empty to the <LOCATION>West Coast</LOCATION>. 
Later, <ORGANIZATION>American President</ORGANIZATION> expanded its trains to carry domestic freight in both directions. 

   "Our international freight volumes gave us the base to create a domestic freight system," says <PERSON>Donald Orris</PERSON>, president of the company's domestic freight unit. 

   Other ship lines, and the rail units of <ORGANIZATION>CSX Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Burlington Northern Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Pacific Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, have launched their own double-stack trains. 
Now they are trying to lure <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> domestic shippers to use the the trains by ordering thousands of large-capacity containers, expanding terminals, speeding up train schedules and reducing rates. 
Currently, domestic freight accounts for about <PERCENT>30%</PERCENT> of the cargo on double-stack trains and the business is growing rapidly. 

   <ORGANIZATION>CSX</ORGANIZATION> and American President have begun to dispatch their own company trucks and drivers, rather than relying on independent drivers, to move containers between shippers' loading docks and their railheads. 
That will eliminate some shipment delays, they say. 
And American President is refunding freight charges when it fails to deliver on time. 

   Double-stack operators are also making organizational changes, hiring executives from the trucking industry, for example. 
"The rails have finally realized after trial and error that to be competitive with truckers you have to think and act like a trucker," says <PERSON>M. McNeil Porter</PERSON>, a former trucking company executive who is president of <ORGANIZATION>CSX</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>CSL Intermodal</ORGANIZATION> unit. 

   Some shippers aren't likely to shift freight to double-stack trains any time soon. 
"Motor carriers cover more routes, give better service and their transit time is less," says <PERSON>Peter Brock</PERSON>, transportation manager of <ORGANIZATION>J.C. Penney Co</ORGANIZATION>. 
The trains are restricted, particularly in the <LOCATION>East</LOCATION>, by bridge and tunnel clearances. 
And shipper surveys rate trucks higher than rail intermodal service in reliability, speed, door-to-door delivery and customer responsiveness. 

   But <ORGANIZATION>3M Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Campbell Soup Co.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>General Electric Co.</ORGANIZATION>'s appliance division have recently switched some shipments to double-stack trains from trucks. 
One reason <ORGANIZATION>Procter &amp; Gamble</ORGANIZATION> switched some of its freight to trains from trucks is that "they use less fuel and create less pollution and that's good for the country," says <PERSON>Fred Morris</PERSON>, the company's transportation director. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Nabisco Foods Co.</ORGANIZATION> also plans to divert certain shipments to double-stacks because the company is concerned about the growing shortage of long-haul truck drivers. 
"We're trying to protect ourselves by putting as much freight on rail as we can," says <PERSON>William Ditoro</PERSON>, transportation director of the <ORGANIZATION>RJR Nabisco Inc.</ORGANIZATION> unit. 
"We're trying to wean ourselves off trucks."

   <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, under orders from the <ORGANIZATION>Interstate Commerce Commission</ORGANIZATION> to sell one of its two railroad units, is trying to persuade the regulatory agency to allow it to sell only a portion of the <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific Transportation Co.</ORGANIZATION>, commission staff members and industry officials said. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> wants to retain Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION>Atchison Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway</ORGANIZATION>, its more profitable railroad property, these sources said. 
It also wants to keep a portion of the <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION>, known as the Cotton Belt line. 
The Cotton Belt, which runs from <LOCATION>New Mexico</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION> and from <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Tennesee</LOCATION>, would provide the <ORGANIZATION>Atchison Topeka &amp; Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> with two new gateways to the East: <LOCATION>Memphis</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Tenn.</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>St. Louis</LOCATION>. 

   But such a plan would in turn rob Southern Pacific of these two cities and <LOCATION>Kansas City</LOCATION>, the three most important gateways on its route system. 
"It would be a dagger in the heart of the <LOCATION>Southern Pacific</LOCATION>," a source close to the San Francisco-based railroad said. 

   <PERSON>Robert D. Krebs</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION>'s chief executive officer, said through a spokesman that the company is continuing work on a divestiture plan and that reports of the possible sale of the Cotton Belt are "premature." 

   <PERSON>Denman K. McNear</PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION>, declined to comment. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> was formed in <DATE>1983</DATE> through the merger of the two railroads' parent companies, <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Industries Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific Co</ORGANIZATION>. 
In <DATE>June</DATE>, it lost a four-year battle to merge the two railroad units, which had long competed for the transport of a wide range of commodities across the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Midwest</LOCATION> and which it continued to operate separately pending <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION> approval. 
But the <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION>, which denied the merger on anti-competitive grounds, ordered the railroad, energy and real estate concern to submit a divestiture plan by <DATE>Sept. 28</DATE>. 

   Since then, <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> officials have had several meetings with <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION> commissioners and staff to discuss the possible sale of parts of <LOCATION>Southern Pacific</LOCATION>, the industry and commission sources said. 
Although it is unclear if the commission will allow the sale of only a portion of <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION>, at least one commissioner, <PERSON>Paul Lamboley</PERSON>, has criticized the <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> plan as "just another attempt at a merger," a commission official said. 

   Only one company, <ORGANIZATION>Kansas City Southern Industries Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, has so far publicly expressed an interest in <LOCATION>Southern Pacific</LOCATION>. 
But <ORGANIZATION>Kansas City Southern</ORGANIZATION> has yet to make a specific offer. 

   The Cotton Belt has been one of the more profitable routes in the <LOCATION>Southern Pacific</LOCATION> system. 
In the <DATE>first five months of 1987</DATE>, the line had revenue of <MONEY>$150 million</MONEY>, compared with <MONEY>$140 million</MONEY> in the same period of <DATE>1986</DATE>. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> unit had <DATE>1986</DATE> revenue of <MONEY>$2.27 billion</MONEY>. 

   Through the Cotton Belt line and its gateways at <LOCATION>St. Louis</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Memphis</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kansas City</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New Orleans</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> trains transfer a wide range of cargo, including autos, lumber and petrochemicals, to other rail carriers for delivery to eastern cities. 
If the <ORGANIZATION>Atchison Topeka &amp; Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> is allowed to take control of those gateways, "it would spell disaster for the <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION>," an industry official said.

   <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp.</ORGANIZATION> said it petitioned the <ORGANIZATION>Interstate Commerce Commission</ORGANIZATION> late <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> to reconsider the rejection of a plan to merge its two railway units -- <LOCATION>Atchison</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway and Southern Pacific Transportation Co</ORGANIZATION>. 

   The appeal was expected. 
The regulatory commission blocked the proposed merger of the two railway units in <DATE>July</DATE> because of worries that it would hurt competition in the <LOCATION>Southwest</LOCATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> had until <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> to ask that the merger talks be reopened. 

   The railroad combination, which was the first to be rejected by the <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION> in two decades, would have formed the nation's third-largest rail system. 
The two railway units have operated separately since their parents, <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Industries Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, combined in <DATE>1983</DATE> to form <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION>. 
The companies' operations were combined except for the railroads, which need <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION> approval to merge. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> also has interests in natural resources and forest products. 

   Since the <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION>'s rejection, <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> has been trying to win support for the merger of its units from its railroad competitors. 
Earlier this month, it agreed to give <ORGANIZATION>Union Pacific Corp.</ORGANIZATION> the right to operate on some of the units' lines, among other things. 
The agreement is similar to a <DATE>September</DATE> accord that gave <ORGANIZATION>Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western Railroad</ORGANIZATION> access to markets west of <LOCATION>Ogden</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
   In <DATE>1983</DATE>, executives of the <ORGANIZATION>Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway</ORGANIZATION> devised a plan that seemed as solid as the carrier's granite track beds: create a giant new railroad by acquiring the rival <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION>. 

   But <DATE>four years later</DATE>, one of the biggest mergers in rail history is falling apart. 
Although the parent companies have combined their assets, management errors and regulatory red tape have repeatedly delayed the blending of the two railroads, which are still held in separate units. 
Employee morale at both railroads has plunged, and contracts have been lost. 
In <DATE>April</DATE>, frustration over the ill-fated merger led to the ouster of Chairman <PERSON>John J. Schmidt</PERSON>. 
In <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>San Joaquin Valley</LOCATION>, stretches of track that were built to join the two railways end abruptly in the dirt. 

   But even as the two railroads and their parent, <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, struggle with these problems, a much bigger one may be about to hit. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Interstate Commerce Commission</ORGANIZATION>, which rejected the merger of the two lines in a decision last year, may vote at its scheduled meeting tomorrow to reject an appeal to reconsider the case. 
Although the agency could still change its mind, such a decision would be a consistent end to one of the most disaster-prone acquisitions in business history. 

   "It's a corporate and political mess that's positively stupefying," says <PERSON>William L. Withuhn</PERSON>, a railroad historian at the <ORGANIZATION>Smithsonian</ORGANIZATION> Institution in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>. 
He adds that he can't remember a more "complex, tragic and confused railroad merger proposal." 

   If the commission does the unexpected and reopens the case, the review could last for years. 
That would probably be worse for the company than to bring the matter to a close now. 

   The failure of the merger could significantly alter the railroad map in the <LOCATION>Westand</LOCATION> possibly beyond. 
In addition to their colorful histories, both lines are major rail links. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION>'s greatest strength is its high-speed route between <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, which <PERSON>Judy Garland</PERSON> helped immortalize in the <PERSON>Johnny Mercer/Harry Warren</PERSON> song "On the <LOCATION>Atchison</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Topeka</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Santa Fe</LOCATION>." 
The <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, carries major quantities of the nation's lumber, produce, chemicals and merchandise containers. 
It also played a major role in developing <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> and was once the state's biggest private landowner. 

   An <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION> decision would probably include an order for the parent company to immediately divest itself of at least one of the railroads. 
Although the two carriers might be able to operate independently for some time, it is more probable that one or both would be sold to other railroads either as single entities or in pieces. 
In fact, one of the lines could end up in the hands of an <LOCATION>East Coast</LOCATION> railroad, forming the nation's first transcontinental carrier at a time when coast-to-coast rail traffic is surging because of heavy container traffic from <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Far East</LOCATION>. 

   The two railroads may have been the victims of bad timing. 
A few years before their proposed combination, the <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION> had easily approved the big mergers that created the <LOCATION>Norfolk Southern</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>CSX</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Union Pacific</ORGANIZATION>. 
In arguing their case, the <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> maintained, among other things, that the earlier decisions entitled them to similar treatment. 
And many in the industry believed that the proposal would fly through all government hearings with little problem. 

   But when the <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> brought their case, the <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION> was under increasing pressure from <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> to re-regulate the railroad industry. 
In addition, the carriers may have been overconfident. 
In any case, they presented a case that was filled with contradictions and errors. 
"It was an ecstasy of fumbling," says an <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION> official. 
Commissioner <PERSON>Malcolm M.B. Sterrett</PERSON> adds that the hearing record was "replete with self-contradictory testimony, omissions and fuzziness." 

   The <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> started discussing a merger in the <DATE>summer of 1980</DATE>. 
But talks broke off after the two sides failed to agree on a price or a plan. 
One problem was a personality clash between the two railroads' leaders. 
<PERSON>John Shedd Reed</PERSON>, the Yale-educated chairman of the <LOCATION>Santa Fe</LOCATION>, was known for his genteel style. 
<PERSON>Benjamin Biaggini</PERSON>, the strong-willed Louisianian who headed the <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION>, liked to play tough. 
Once, in the middle of a bumpy rail trip, he stopped the train and ordered the manager responsible for track maintenance to get off and stay out of the office until the tracks had been repaired. 

   In <DATE>1983</DATE> <PERSON>Mr. Reed</PERSON> retired, and his successor, <PERSON>John Schmidt</PERSON>, almost immediately resurrected the idea of a merger. 
Deregulation had led to a wave of big railroad combinations, and <PERSON>Mr. Schmidt</PERSON>, a lawyer with a deep concern for the bottom line, was worried about the consequences of being left out. 
This time, <PERSON>Mr. Biaggini</PERSON> agreed. 

   The two companies were so confident of success that they merged their parent companies - including their real-estate, pipeline, mineral and timber interests -- without waiting for the <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION> to complete its review. 
Because federal law forbids merging railroads without <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION> approval, they left the two carriers in separate subsidiaries. 
But they began repainting the locomotives with the red and yellow color scheme of the merged railroad. 

   From an antitrust standpoint, railroad merger cases tend to be complicated because they involve a wide range of interested parties from many locations. 
Until <DATE>1976</DATE>, when <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> imposed a 31-month time limit on <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION> merger proceedings, some rail cases dragged on interminably. 
Many in the industry blamed the collapse of the <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railroad</ORGANIZATION> on a decade-long <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION> review. 

   But the process is still costly and exhaustive. 
Before the commission made its initial ruling in the <LOCATION>Santa Fe/Southern Pacific</LOCATION> case, it heard testimony from 130 witnesses, reviewed 600 exhibits and read more than 18,000 pages of transcripts. 

   Despite uncountable hours of preparation, the two railroads turned out to be their own worst enemies. 
A <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> witness testified that the merger wouldn't reduce competition because the two railroads -- both of which operate primarily in the West -- don't overlap much in the types of cargo that they carry. 
But the same witness later tried to make the point that other railroads that carted even one ton of any type of cargo would constitute a competitive threat to the combined <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe/ Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION>. 

   At another point, <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION>'s lawyers argued that competition from trucks would mitigate the effects of the merger. 
But the company's chief witness on the subject testified that trucks can't carry many bulk commodities as cheaply and efficiently as railroads. 

   The most apparent inconsistencies had to do with <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION>'s estimates of the financial strength of the <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION>. 
First, the <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> filed affidavits saying that it would be viable for years to come. 
Later, <PERSON>Mr. Schmidt</PERSON> said that the <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> was close to bankruptcy. 
Investment bankers for the railroads variously estimated the worth of the <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> at <MONEY>$800 million</MONEY> and at a negative <MONEY>$200 million</MONEY>. 

   At one point, a flood of mail began to pour into the commission from rail customers who said they supported the merger. 
But <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION> staff members noticed that each letter misspelled the name of the <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION>'s executive secretary, <PERSON>Noreta R. McGee</PERSON>. 
Instead of impressing the <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION>, the campaign helped lead to an inquiry into whether the railroads were unduly pressuring customers to support the merger. 

   The smoking gun, however, turned out to be a confidential report from <PERSON>Mr. Schmidt</PERSON> to the board about the pricing advantages of the merger. 
The memo said that the combination would help the railroads achieve "pricing freedom" and that one of the goals was a rail monopoly in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Southwest</LOCATION>. 
Although <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> succeeded in persuading the commission to keep the report under seal, the <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION> later referred to the memo as a "candid appraisal . . . unlike expert testimony and legal argument" of the true view of the <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> railroad's management. 

   Last <DATE>July</DATE>, following a mere 17-minute discussion, the commission voted 4-1 to reject the merger as anti-competitive. 
The decision was unexpected, and it stunned the industry. 
<ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> had to cancel a luncheon with securities analysts scheduled for that day on the benefits of a favorable <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION> ruling. 

   Few, however, were more surprised than <PERSON>Mr. Schmidt</PERSON>. 
Calling the decision a "horrible mistake," he vowed a grassroots campaign to overturn it and ordered the company's lawyers to petition the <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION> to reopen the case. 

   Privately, though, some <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> board members were already blaming <PERSON>Mr. Schmidt</PERSON> for the commission's decision. 
In addition to the memo, some faulted him for being undiplomatic throughout the process. 
Indeed, afraid that the <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION> might yield to demands for changes, <PERSON>Mr. Schmidt</PERSON> had taken a tough, take-it-or-leave-it stance throughout the process. 

   The strategy seemed particularly ill-chosen later when, in an effort to get the merger reconsidered, <PERSON>Mr. Schmidt</PERSON> himself began offering concessions. 
One that particularly upset <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> employees was a proposal to lease what some believed was the soul of the railroad: the line between <LOCATION>Sacramento</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Ogden</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION>, which dates back to <DATE>1869</DATE>. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Schmidt</PERSON>'s concessions, which eventually covered thousands of miles of track, "gave away more than we would have liked," says <PERSON>Robert West</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> director. 
After all the changes, it "wasn't the same merger it was and didn't have the same benefits," says <PERSON>Lester Kloss</PERSON>, a senior vice president of <ORGANIZATION>A.T. Kearney Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a consultant for both railroads. 

   The concessions brought other problems as well. 
While they helped <PERSON>Mr. Schmidt</PERSON> persuade the <ORGANIZATION>Union Pacific</ORGANIZATION> to support the merger, they angered the <LOCATION>Burlington Northern</LOCATION>, which switched from a neutral position to opposing the merger. 
<PERSON>Mr. Schmidt</PERSON> declined repeated requests from this newspaper for an interview on his role. 

   Opposition from competitors also contributed to the initial rejection of the merger, and that has angered <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> executives. 
"What irritates me," says <PERSON>Mr. Reed</PERSON>, "is that we didn't oppose the <LOCATION>Burlington Northern</LOCATION> mergers. 
We were gentlemen about it. 
But now that they've got theirs, they don't want anyone else to have similar capabilities." 

   The deterioration of the railroads -- particularly the <LOCATION>Southern Pacific</LOCATION> - during this limbo period has led to a decline in employee morale. 
Engines have even been allowed to run out of fuel in mid-trip. 
"To a person, our employees are sick to death of the process. 
Sick of decisions not being made or being made in a convoluted fashion. 
Sick to death of this merger," says a mid-level manager at the <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION>. 

   Competitors have been able to lure away business by exploiting the low morale and <PERSON>Mr. Schmidt</PERSON>'s talk of a <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> bankruptcy -- "an unfortunate choice of words on his part," says <PERSON>Edward Ahern</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION>'s vice president of administration. 
Overall, <ORGANIZATION>Union Pacific</ORGANIZATION> has benefited the most, scoring a major coup when it won a big contract to haul finished automobiles for a joint venture of <ORGANIZATION>Toyota</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>General Motors</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Fremont</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif</LOCATION>. 

   As the case has worn on, the distractions at both railroads have become overpowering. 
The merger "drove us nuts," says <PERSON>Lawrence Cena</PERSON>, who retired as the <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> railroad's president about a year ago. 
Among other things, it contributed to the <LOCATION>Santa Fe</LOCATION>'s tardy entry into doublestack container trains, which carry ocean containers one above the other. 

   On the <DATE>Friday</DATE> before <DATE>Easter</DATE>, according to current and former managers of the two railroads, a group of outside <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> directors, led by <PERSON>Mr. Biaggini</PERSON>, the former <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> chairman, began plotting the ouster of <PERSON>Mr. Schmidt</PERSON>. 
Although the two men had once been allies, <PERSON>Mr. Biaggini</PERSON> was angered shortly after his retirement when <PERSON>Mr. Schmidt</PERSON> took away his use of the company jet and forced him to vacate a large office with a panoramic view of <LOCATION>San Francisco Bay</LOCATION> for an office one-quarter the size with a view of a courtyard. 

   At a hastily called meeting, the board sided with <PERSON>Mr. Biaggini</PERSON>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Schmidt</PERSON> was given a consultant's contract, reportedly worth <MONEY>$5 million</MONEY>, and an out-of-the-way office. 
His predecessor, <PERSON>Mr. Reed</PERSON>, agreed to come out of retirement to temporarily lead the company. 
<PERSON>Mr. Biaggini</PERSON> declines to discuss his role in the board's affairs. 

   Now, <PERSON>Mr. Reed</PERSON> finds himself confronting the company's biggest challenge ever. 
If the <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION> rules against the merger, he will have to decide whether the parent company should remain in the railroad business at all. 
"The most frustrating part is that the two companies have been in suspense for so many years," he says. 

   At the company's recent annual meeting, <PERSON>Mr. Reed</PERSON>, 70, told the audience that he had never dreamed he would return to the corporation. 
"I'm just an old lantern swinger," he said at one point. 
But later, when asked whether he thought the merger would ever succeed, he paused and looked perplexed. 
"With the way things have gone so far," he said, "I guess you couldn't be surprised by anything that might happen."

   SAN FRANCISCO -- Soon after Philip Anschutz bought
Southern Pacific Transportation Co. in 1988, dozens of
employees gathered in the Utah desert to re-create railroad
history.
   As cameras clicked, the celebrants posed on facing diesel
locomotives from the Southern Pacific and from Mr. Anschutz's
smaller Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western. Recalling the 1869
"golden spike" ceremony on completion of the first
transcontinental railroad, the scene was meant to symbolize
Mr. Anschutz's plan to revive Southern Pacific as part of a
new railroad across the West.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But <PERSON>Mr. Anschutz</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> is hitting rough
track.
   Faced with deepening losses at the railroad and high debt
obligations, <PERSON>Mr. Anschutz</PERSON> is keeping the <LOCATION>Southern Pacific</LOCATION>
afloat with accelerated real estate sales. Shippers complain
of management confusion, erratic pricing tactics and delays
caused by worn-out locomotives.
   "A lot of people thought <PERSON>Anschutz</PERSON> coming aboard was like
<LOCATION>Santa Claus</LOCATION> coming down the chimney," says <PERSON>Rollin Bredenberg</PERSON>,
a <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> general manager. But combining the
railroad with <PERSON>Mr. Anschutz</PERSON>'s smaller <ORGANIZATION>Denver &amp; Rio Grande
Western</ORGANIZATION> "hasn't solved any of the fundamental problems of the
<LOCATION>Southern Pacific</LOCATION>," he concedes.
   Others worry that <PERSON>Mr. Anschutz</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION> owner of oil and
gas, real estate and Western art, doesn't know how to run a
railroad. <PERSON>Robert Starzel</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> vice chairman
and <PERSON>Anschutz</PERSON> confidant, says that railroading has proven
"difficult for us" but insists his boss will make the
railroad prosper.
   Although the <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> is the weakest of the
nation's seven major railroads and isn't publicly owned, its
health is of keen interest to shippers, consumers and
travelers. The railroad is the largest hauler of
international goods to the <LOCATION>Midwest</LOCATION> from <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION>
ports and its scenic routes are traversed by <ORGANIZATION>Amtrak</ORGANIZATION> passenger
trains.
   <PERSON>Mr. Anschutz</PERSON> and minority partner, <ORGANIZATION>Morgan Stanley &amp; Co.</ORGANIZATION>,
acquired the company in a <MONEY>$1.02 billion</MONEY> leveraged buy-out
plus assumption of <MONEY>$780 million</MONEY> debt. The purchase was widely
hailed by <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> employees after a plan to merge
the railroad with <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Pacific Corp.</ORGANIZATION> was rejected by the
<ORGANIZATION>Interstate Commerce Commission</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1987</DATE>.
   But hopes for fast rejuvenation of <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> have
faded. The company's rail operations had a loss of <MONEY>$66
million</MONEY> last year, reflecting a downturn in automobile and
lumber traffic, rate wars, a major accident and the cost of
adding new trains. Proceeds from property sales, however,
resulted in net income of <MONEY>$98 million</MONEY>.
   However, when real estate sales failed to cover the
company's burden of debt and capital spending, <ORGANIZATION>Southern
Pacific</ORGANIZATION> renegotiated terms of its loan with <ORGANIZATION>Bank of America</ORGANIZATION>
last <DATE>December</DATE> to avoid default. In <DATE>April</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Moody's Investors
Service</ORGANIZATION> downgraded <MONEY>$695 million</MONEY> of the company's long-term
debt, concluding that proceeds from real estate sales will
only partially offset the gap in cash from lower rail
operating earnings.
   The company's disappointing railroad performance has
shaken the confidence of some shippers. "I'm concerned that
they will become financially insolvent and the railroad will
be sold piecemeal," says <PERSON>Homer Bollard</PERSON>, general traffic
manager of <ORGANIZATION>Louisiana-Pacific Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, a big lumber shipper.
   Southern Pacific officials dismiss such concerns. "This
isn't a question of bankruptcy. There are <MONEY>billions of dollars</MONEY>
of assets here," says Vice Chairman <PERSON>Starzel</PERSON>. Even if company
forecasts for profitable rail operations next year don't pan
out, <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> could support its railroad with
proceeds from real estate sales for years, <PERSON>Mr. Starzel</PERSON> says.
   <PERSON>Mr. Anschutz</PERSON> declines to give interviews. But he has told
shippers that his 15,000-mile rail franchise is among the
strongest, because it includes two major east-west routes and
track to most <LOCATION>West</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Gulf</LOCATION> coast ports. To strengthen the
system, <PERSON>Mr. Anschutz</PERSON> bought a regional rail line last year,
giving <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> trains direct access to <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> for
the first time. Now he is trying to overcome the objections
of competing railroads to buy a second route to <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>.
Slight, restless and 50 years old, <PERSON>Mr. Anschutz</PERSON> likes to take
freight trains to meet crew members and entertain shippers
aboard the <PERSON>Anschutz</PERSON> family yacht.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> is struggling to regain ground lost
to competitors when it was held in trust for five years
pending its aborted merger with <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION>. While Southern
Pacific languished, larger rivals <ORGANIZATION>Union Pacific Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and
<ORGANIZATION>Burlington Northern Inc.</ORGANIZATION> moved aggressively to shed surplus
lines and employees and invest in modern technology.
   Without the heavy coal and grain traffic of <ORGANIZATION>Union Pacific</ORGANIZATION>
and <LOCATION>Burlington Northern</LOCATION>, the railroad is also highly
dependent upon cyclical and rate competitive shipments of
lumber, automobiles, chemicals and containerized freight.
   <PERSON>Mr. Anschutz</PERSON> also inherited the results of years of
lagging capital spending. Although <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION>'s main
lines have been upgraded, some of its yards are old and
poorly maintained. As he walks through <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION>'s
freight yard in <LOCATION>Portland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ore.</LOCATION>, trainmaster <PERSON>Robert Melbo</PERSON> is
summoned by radio to a two-car derailment caused by rotted
ties under the rails.
   Much of the company's locomotive fleet is old and
outmoded. And its freight cars for carrying lumber are
deplorable, says <PERSON>Dennis Williams</PERSON>, director of traffic and
distribution at <ORGANIZATION>Bohemia Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Eugene</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Ore.</LOCATION> "They have some
good cars but too few. The rest are old and inefficient."
   But some problems are of <PERSON>Mr. Anschutz</PERSON>'s own making. He
built the railroad's management team with a president from
the <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> and a vice chairman from <ORGANIZATION>Denver &amp; Rio
Grande</ORGANIZATION>, even though the two railroads have conflicting
philosophies. While President <PERSON>D. Michael Mohan</PERSON> was steeped in
the <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION>'s costcutting ways, Vice Chairman
<PERSON>William Holtman</PERSON> learned at <ORGANIZATION>Denver &amp; Rio Grande</ORGANIZATION> to put a
premium on service. Southern Pacific executives say the
confusion is heightened because <PERSON>Mr. Holtman</PERSON> sometimes differs
with <PERSON>Mr. Mohan</PERSON> on important decisions.
   Last year <PERSON>Mr. Mohan</PERSON> tried to cut crew costs by ordering
that freight trains be combined. But after freight began to
back up in yards and customers complained of delayed
shipments, <PERSON>Mr. Holtman</PERSON> shortened train sizes. "We adopt a
strategy, and before it can produce results, we drop it and
try something else," says <PERSON>Mr. Melbo</PERSON>, the trainmaster, adding
that the company has changed its train-size requirements four
times in the past 18 months.
   <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> has won some freight lost to competitors
but often at such low rates that the railroad lost money
hauling the traffic. "In our zeal to sign up customers we
lost sight of the fact that you sign them up to make money,
not just to lure them away from someone else," says a former
<ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> vice president.
   Now, the railroad's efforts to boost rates are straining
relationships with customers. "They had tremendous reductions
in rates to gain market share and then raised rates beyond
what the market will bear," says <PERSON>Philip Yeager</PERSON>, chairman of
<ORGANIZATION>Hub Group</ORGANIZATION>, a Chicago-based shippers' agent. "They have
bewildered the shipping public."
   Company officials say <PERSON>Mr. Anschutz</PERSON> sought to clear up
management confusion last fall by declaring <PERSON>Mr. Holtman</PERSON> head
of the railroad's day-to-day operations while putting <PERSON>Mr.
Mohan</PERSON> in charge of marketing and long-range strategy. Last
month <PERSON>Mr. Anschutz</PERSON> hired <PERSON>Don Orris</PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION>American
President Cos.</ORGANIZATION> executive who is highly regarded by shippers,
to give new direction to <LOCATION>Southern Pacific</LOCATION>'s troubled
marketing and sales department.
   Some shippers see signs of improvements. American
President, a big container shipper, recently dropped threats
to abandon the <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> after the railroad boosted
on-time delivery of its shipments to <PERCENT>90%</PERCENT> from <PERCENT>60%</PERCENT>.
   <PERSON>Mr. Anschutz</PERSON> has won praise from rail labor. <PERSON>Glynn
Gallagher</PERSON>, a general chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>United Transportation
Union</ORGANIZATION>, says <PERSON>Mr. Anschutz</PERSON> improved relations between
management and labor by retiring a vice president who was
unpopular because of his harsh disciplinary tactics. "We're a
lot better off with <PERSON>Anschutz</PERSON> than we would have been any
other way," says <PERSON>Mr. Gallagher</PERSON>, who is supporting a plan to
sharply reduce crew sizes aboard <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> freight
trains in the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION>.
   Meanwhile, <PERSON>Mr. Anschutz</PERSON> tries to accelerate sales of real
estate that company officials value at close to <MONEY>$2 billion</MONEY>.
The company stunned long-time employees last month by
announcing that the company's <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> headquarters
building may be offered for sale. <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> is also
trying to peddle surplus lines in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>San
Francisco</LOCATION> to the state for rail transit corridors. When state
officials had trouble meeting the company's price for the
lines, <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> contributed <MONEY>$250,000</MONEY> to an
environmental group that campaigned for new sources of
transit funding. Californians voted on and passed measures
<DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, which will provide <MONEY>$1.9 billion</MONEY> for state rail
projects.
   "Voters have said not only that they want these rail
corridors but that they are willing to pay for them and that
can mean a lot of money for us," <PERSON>Mr. Starzel</PERSON> said.

<HL> Santa Fe Southern Clears One Hurdle
In 3-Year Bid to Merge Railroad Units

   <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp.</ORGANIZATION>'s three-year struggle to merge the <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe and Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> railroads cleared one hurdle, but another may have surfaced. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> said it and <ORGANIZATION>Union Pacific Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, another railroad concern, agreed on a plan to clear up regulatory concerns that doomed the merger of the <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> lines last <DATE>summer</DATE>. 
But at the same time, <ORGANIZATION>Union Pacific</ORGANIZATION> voiced new objections to a similar agreement between <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> and another competitor. 
Those concerns could further tangle the merger effort. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> was formed in <DATE>1983</DATE> by the combination of <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Industries Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific Corp</ORGANIZATION>. 
The two companies' energy and other operations were immediately merged, but their railroad units have been kept apart pending <ORGANIZATION>Interstate Commerce Commission</ORGANIZATION> approval. 

   As previously reported, the <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION> unexpectedly quashed the merger in <DATE>July</DATE> because of worries that the combination would stifle competition across the <ORGANIZATION>Southwest</ORGANIZATION>. 
The rejection, the first time the <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION> had killed a railroad merger in 20 years, stunned the industry and led many industry officials to fear that the era of consolidation that began two decades ago -- the only thing that has kept many railroad concerns alive -- has ended. 

   Union Pacific originally argued against the merger, which would have created the nation's third-largest rail system. 
The new agreement, which will be submitted to the <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION> as part of a petition to reopen merger hearings, would give <ORGANIZATION>Union Pacific</ORGANIZATION> the right to run its trains over some <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> lines in <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION> and other areas. 
It would also give <ORGANIZATION>Union Pacific</ORGANIZATION> certain pricing authority and other rights. 

   However, a <ORGANIZATION>Union Pacific</ORGANIZATION> official said that <ORGANIZATION>Union Pacific</ORGANIZATION> has "serious problems" with a similar agreement forged between <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Southern Pacific and Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western Railroad Co.</ORGANIZATION>, another competitor that originally opposed the merger. 
In <DATE>September</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> agreed to give <ORGANIZATION>Denver &amp; Rio Grande</ORGANIZATION> access to markets west of <LOCATION>Ogden</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION>. 
In return, <ORGANIZATION>Denver &amp; Rio Grande</ORGANIZATION> said it would drop its opposition to the combination. 

   But the agreement allows <ORGANIZATION>Denver &amp; Rio Grande</ORGANIZATION> to operate in <LOCATION>central California</LOCATION> for the first time. 
<ORGANIZATION>Union Pacific</ORGANIZATION>, which has operations in that area, has "problems with that, and that's something we'll have to have addressed" if the <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION> takes up the merger again, the <ORGANIZATION>Union Pacific</ORGANIZATION> official said. 

   A <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> spokesman said he "wouldn't want to characterize" <ORGANIZATION>Union Pacific</ORGANIZATION>'s stance. 
He said <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> intends to go through with its agreement with <ORGANIZATION>Denver &amp; Rio Grande</ORGANIZATION>. 
"We recognize that not everybody will always be satisfied with these things," he said. 
"That's often the case where the <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION> is concerned." 

   <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> has been expected to formally ask the <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION> to reconsider the merger for months. 
The spokesman said the company will submit its appeal to have the merger talks reopened within the next few days. 
It has until <DATE>Dec. 9</DATE> to file the petition, he said.

   <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp.</ORGANIZATION> agreed to sell its <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> railroad unit to <ORGANIZATION>Rio Grande Industries Inc.</ORGANIZATION> for <MONEY>$1.02 billion</MONEY>, but the proposal is likely to be vigorously contested in regulatory proceedings that could last a year or longer. 

   Two unsuccessful bidders -- <ORGANIZATION>Kansas City Southern Industries Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Railway Labor Executives' Association</ORGANIZATION>, which represents <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> employees -- said they oppose the proposed sale and will continue to pursue their bids. 
"The process has just begun," said <PERSON>Richard I. Kilroy</PERSON>, chairman of the railway association. 

   The proposed sale also drew criticism from <ORGANIZATION>Henley Group Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a La Jolla, Calif.-based company that holds a <PERCENT>14.7%</PERCENT> stake in <ORGANIZATION>Sante Fe</ORGANIZATION>. 
Henley, which has hinted that it is considering a proxy battle or tender offer for <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION>, called the proposal "unwise," saying it "amounts to a bankruptcy auction." 

   <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> decided to sell <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> after the <ORGANIZATION>Interstate Commerce Commission</ORGANIZATION>, citing anti-competitive concerns, ordered the Chicago-based company to shed one of the two railroad units that it has operated since <DATE>1983</DATE>. 
But <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION> approval also will be needed for the sale to <LOCATION>Rio Grande</LOCATION>, a railroad unit of <ORGANIZATION>Denver-based Anschutz Corp</ORGANIZATION>. 

   <PERSON>Malcolm Sterrett</PERSON>, one of five <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION> commissioners, said the agency hopes to make a decision about the proposed sale "as soon as possible." 
He added, however, that the process could take a year or longer. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> said proceeds from the proposed sale would be used in connection with a plan to pay <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> shareholders at least <MONEY>$4 billion</MONEY> in a previously announced restructuring of the railroad and energy concern. 
That plan, which involves additional borrowings, is seen partly as an effort to leverage <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> to make it less attractive to unwanted suitors. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION>Rio Grande</ORGANIZATION> agreed to pay <MONEY>$1.02 billion</MONEY> in cash for <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> and to assume about <MONEY>$780 million</MONEY> in outstanding debt. 
<PERSON>Robert D. Krebs</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION>'s chief executive officer, said in a prepared statement that the proposed sale "is consistent with the public interest and is in the best interest of our shareholders." 

   However, <ORGANIZATION>Kansas City Southern</ORGANIZATION> said its offer, which wasn't disclosed, was "hundreds of <MONEY>millions of dollars</MONEY> higher in value" and faced "fewer regulatory problems." 
A spokeswoman for the <LOCATION>Kansas City</LOCATION>, Mo.-based railroad pointed out that, when the <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION> ordered <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> to divest one of its railroad units, the agency commented that merging the <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> with the <ORGANIZATION>Rio Grande</ORGANIZATION> would result in "a loss of railroad competition in the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION>." 
An <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION> official said that didn't necessarily mean the commission would reject the proposed sale. 

   Meanwhile, the railway employees association, which had offered to match any bid, maintained that its proposal was "the most viable in satisfying the <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION>'s divestiture order and the concerns of employees covered by existing agreements." 

   In <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Denman K. McNear</PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION>, which has operated under a trust for the <DATE>last four years</DATE>, said that management is "disappointed" that its efforts with the railway employees association to buy the railroad "were not favorably considered." 

   Henley, which has interests in manufacturing, engineering and real estate, reiterated its contention that a sale or spinoff of <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION>'s "healthy" <PERSON>Atchison</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Topeka &amp; Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> railroad "would create significant value for shareholders and give the ailing <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> a chance to recover." 

   <PERSON>Michael D. Dingman</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Henley</ORGANIZATION>'s chairman and chief executive officer, declined to say what action his company might take in response to the proposed sale of the <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION>. 
The executive called the transaction "a travesty" and said that the proposed sale price is "way under its substantial value." 
However, <PERSON>Mr. Dingman</PERSON> added that "with a company as big as <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> there's still a lot of value there" even without <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION>. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Dingman</PERSON> also said that he expects the transaction "to create a turmoil at the <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION>." 

   A spokesman for <ORGANIZATION>Olympia &amp; York Developments Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, which holds an <PERCENT>8.2%</PERCENT> stake in <LOCATION>Santa Fe</LOCATION>, said the Toronto-based real estate company didn't plan any immediate comment on the proposed sale. 

   Southern <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION>, formally known as the <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific Transportation Co.</ORGANIZATION>, operates a 13,000-mile system stretching from <LOCATION>Portland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ore.</LOCATION>, to <LOCATION>New Orleans</LOCATION> with a route going from <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Kansas City</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mo.</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>St. Louis</LOCATION>. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western Railroad</ORGANIZATION> unit of <ORGANIZATION>Rio Grande Industries</ORGANIZATION> is a 2,500-mile system between <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Kansas City</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mo</LOCATION>. 

   The combination would create one of the five largest rail systems in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, a 15,500-mile system serving 14 states. 
<PERSON>Samuel R. Freeman</PERSON>, vice president and general counsel for <ORGANIZATION>Rio Grande</ORGANIZATION>, maintained that it would be "an end-to-end merger" that would "restore the competitive balance" in the central <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>

the <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION> vote in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION>
   <ORGANIZATION>Rio Grande Industries</ORGANIZATION> has agreed to buy the <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION>
from <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp.</ORGANIZATION> for <MONEY>$1.2 billion</MONEY>. <ORGANIZATION>Kansas City
Southern</ORGANIZATION> has offered to buy <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> for <MONEY>$1.25 billion</MONEY>.
   But the <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION> in a 4-0 vote said the merger of the <ORGANIZATION>Southern
Pacific</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western</ORGANIZATION> railroads would have
the best competitive results and be in the public interest.
   The commission last year ordered the <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Southern Pacific
Corp.</ORGANIZATION> to divest itself of the <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> after the rejection
of that railroad's merger with the <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Southern</ORGANIZATION> reached agreement with <ORGANIZATION>Rio Grande Industries</ORGANIZATION>,
but when permission for the sale was sought from the <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Kansas
City Southern</ORGANIZATION> objected and sought to buy <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> as well.
   In a series of votes today, the <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION> turned its back on the
<LOCATION>Kansas City Southern</LOCATION> proposal and approved the sale to <ORGANIZATION>Rio Grande
Industries</ORGANIZATION> instead.
   Meanwhile, a three-judge court is scheduled to meet <DATE>Friday</DATE> in
<LOCATION>Kansas City</LOCATION> to consider <ORGANIZATION>KCSI</ORGANIZATION>'s application for a stay of a recent
order barring the company from completing its efforts to purchase
<LOCATION>Southern Pacific</LOCATION>, according to <ORGANIZATION>Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals
Judge Pasco Bowman</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>Bowman</PERSON> told attorneys in <LOCATION>Kansas City</LOCATION> that when a <LOCATION>South Dakota</LOCATION>
judge <DATE>Friday</DATE> prohibited the company from buying <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION>,
he also delayed the prohibition from taking effect until after it
could be appealed.
   Bowman's observation came after a short hearing <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME>.
He said a temporary stay on the prohibition, preventing it from
taking effect, was to last until next <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
   A federal judge in <LOCATION>Sioux Falls</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>S.D.</LOCATION>, last week blocked <ORGANIZATION>KCSI</ORGANIZATION>
from buying <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific Railroad</ORGANIZATION>. Judge <PERSON>John B. Jones</PERSON> said
<LOCATION>Kansas City Southern</LOCATION> could not buy <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> while it is
appealing a <MONEY>$600 million</MONEY> judgment the state of <LOCATION>South Dakota</LOCATION> has
against <ORGANIZATION>Kansas City Southern</ORGANIZATION>.
   The judge ruled for <LOCATION>South Dakota</LOCATION> officials, who argued that the
purchase might jeopardize the recovery of their judgment in the
anti-trust lawsuit.
   But <ORGANIZATION>Kansas City Southern</ORGANIZATION> officials say the purchase would
enhance the value of their company, rather than harm it.
   <LOCATION>South Dakota</LOCATION> won the judgment in a suit alleging <ORGANIZATION>Kansas City
Southern</ORGANIZATION> helped kill a <MONEY>$3.8 billion</MONEY> coal-slurry pipeline that would
have helped the state's economy. The state contended <LOCATION>Kansas City
Southern</LOCATION> worked against the project because it would have hurt the
railroad's business.
   The pipeline plan was dropped in <DATE>1984</DATE>.

<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Billionaire <PERSON>Philip Anschutz</PERSON> has completed a <MONEY>$1.8
billion</MONEY> acquisition of the <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific Railroad</ORGANIZATION>, one of the
nation's oldest rail lines with track stretching from <LOCATION>Oregon</LOCATION> to
<LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION>.
   The historic railroad, combined with his <ORGANIZATION>Denver &amp; Rio Grande
Railroad</ORGANIZATION>, puts <PERSON>Anschutz</PERSON> at the head of the nation's fifth-largest
rail company in terms of track mileage.
   The purchase ``ends years of uncertainty and opens the door to
robust competition in the western rail corridors,'' said <PERSON>Rio Grande
Chariman W. J. Holtman</PERSON> at the deal's closing in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> on
<DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   ``This historic combination brings together two railroads which
hold an important place in the pioneering of the West,'' he noted.
   Anschutz's new railroad has 15,046 miles of track and is ranked
sixth nationally based on revenues estimated at <MONEY>$2.5 billion</MONEY>. The
<ORGANIZATION>Rocky Mountain News</ORGANIZATION> reported that he paid <MONEY>$1.02 billion</MONEY> in cash and
assumed <MONEY>$760 million</MONEY> in debt.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Interstate Commerce Commission</ORGANIZATION> approved the combination in
<DATE>August</DATE>. Last year the <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION> rejected a proposal that Chicago-based
<ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp.</ORGANIZATION> merge the <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> and
<ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> railroads and ordered the company to divest one of the
lines.
   The company chose to sell the <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION>, but had to
overcome the objections of another rail company before it could
proceed. <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION>'s stock has been held in a trust for
nearly five years pending the outcome of the battle over who should
own the railroad.
   <PERSON>Anschutz</PERSON>, who made his fortune in oil, gas and real estate, will
become chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>Mike Mohan</PERSON>, now executive vice president of <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION>,
will become the chief executive of both lines, which will operate
from <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> headquarters. D&amp;RG had been
headquartered in <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION>.
   Anschutz has said 400 to 800 jobs will be lost through the
consolidation of the two companies. The cuts likely will be split
evenly between <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION>.
   The two lines will remain separate entities, although both will
be held by <ORGANIZATION>Rio Grande Industries Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON>Anschutz</PERSON>'s attorney,
<PERSON>Bob Starzel</PERSON>.
   D&amp;RG mainly carries coal on about 2,500 miles of track between
<LOCATION>Kansas City</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mo.</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION> and rents track to other
railroads. Three times a week runs the <ORGANIZATION>Rio Grande Zephyr</ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION>Salt
Lake City</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION>.
   ``This creates the only western railroad with two rail
corridors. ... Now, <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Rio Grande</ORGANIZATION> will be in both
the southern and central corridors,'' <PERSON>Starzel</PERSON> said.

FT  07 JUL 94 / US frontiers blurred after railway merger: Stock swap may
lead to east meeting west
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A railway that makes a profit has become a rarity since road transport
started to offer a cheaper and more flexible alternative. But in the past
few years, <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> railways have been doing very nicely. Now two of them, the
<LOCATION>Burlington Northern</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Santa Fe Pacific</LOCATION>, plan to do even better by
merging their large networks in a Dollars 2.7bn (Pounds 1.8bn) stock swap,
creating by far the biggest railway in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>: the <LOCATION>Burlington Northern</LOCATION> and
<ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION>.
Unlike railways in most other countries, <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> railway companies - all of them
in the private sector - operate only freight trains. Passenger services are
operated over the private railways' tracks by the state-owned <ORGANIZATION>Amtrak</ORGANIZATION>, which
lost Dollars 730m last year.
Just <DATE>20 years ago</DATE>, it was not too fanciful to imagine that <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> railways might
cease to exist. Federal government investment in the construction of an
interstate road system had encouraged rapid growth in the road haulage
industry, and the heavily regulated railways were unable to compete.
With many railways staring at bankruptcy, the industry went through a wave
of mergers in the late <DATE>1970s</DATE> and early <DATE>1980s</DATE> that cut the 17 big railway
companies to seven. Around the same time, the railways also began to see the
first glimmer of salvation with the passage of the Staggers Act in <DATE>1980</DATE>,
which in effect deregulated the industry.
Once the merger mania was over, all the big railways started using their new
commercial freedom to set more competitive freight rates, drop unprofitable
traffic, dispose of loss-making lines and cut jobs. Gradually the red ink
turned to black.
While cost-cutting was the main theme of the <DATE>1980s</DATE>, in the <DATE>1990s</DATE> the
railways have started to win more traffic. Economic growth is one reason for
the increase; a shortage of drivers in the trucking industry has helped,
too. But more importantly, lower costs have enabled the railways to show
they are still capable of competing with road hauliers on price, at least on
long-distance trips.
One of their fastest-growing markets is for intermodal traffic - trailers
and containers that switch from road to rail for the long-distance part of
their journey.
<LOCATION>Burlington Northern</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Santa Fe</LOCATION> say this is why they want to get together.
Although both railways lie to the west of the <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION>, connecting the
<LOCATION>Midwest</LOCATION> with the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> coast, most of <LOCATION>Burlington</LOCATION>'s network lies to the
north of <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION>'s: so connecting the two would greatly increase the number
of long-distance destinations on offer to both railways' customers.
The merged railways would also get a substantial boost to competitiveness
because of the efficiency savings flowing from higher traffic densities and
reduced administrative costs.
The big question, however, is: will they get away with it? The <ORGANIZATION>Interstate
Commerce Commission</ORGANIZATION>, a federal regulatory agency, stood aside during the
wave of railway mergers in the <DATE>1970s</DATE> and early <DATE>1980s</DATE>. But in <DATE>1987</DATE> it
forcibly intervened in a deal between <LOCATION>Santa Fe</LOCATION> and another of the Big Seven
railways, <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION>, telling them to unbundle a merger that had been
accomplished more than <DATE>three years earlier</DATE>.
<ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> hopes this deal will be different. The <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> and Southern
networks, it says, were largely overlapping, and the <ORGANIZATION>Interstate Commerce
Commission</ORGANIZATION> had feared that a merger would reduce competition.
The <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Burlington</LOCATION> networks, by contrast, hardly overlap at all: it
would be an 'end-to-end' merger, increasing the options available to
customers and allowing the merged railways to compete more effectively with
<ORGANIZATION>Union Pacific</ORGANIZATION>, the biggest operator west of the <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION>.
If the commission does allow the merger - and it could be the end of next
year before it reaches a decision - the result could be to encourage more
deals between <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> railways. But future mergers are likely to be different
from any seen before.
For years, the industry has speculated on the possibility that one of the
four big railways to the west of the <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION> might merge with one of the
three big railways to the east - the <LOCATION>Norfolk Southern</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>CSX</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Conrail</ORGANIZATION>.
This would create a transcontinental railway network providing customers
with a seamless coast-to-coast freight transport service, without the costs
and delays associated with interchanging traffic from one operator to
another.
Analysts had speculated that any one merger would start a game of musical
chairs in which the other big railways would also scramble to form east-west
partnerships.
With four companies on one side of the <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION> and three on the other,
it always looked as though one company west of the <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION> would be left
in the cold.
A successful merger between <LOCATION>Burlington</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> would send a signal to
the rest of the railway industry that end-to-end mergers were acceptable to
the commission, and conveniently even up the number of potential partners to
three on each side of the <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION>. At that stage, the logic of a
transcontinental merger wave might become irresistible.

<HEAD>Rio Grande Files Application To Acquire Southern Pacific</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   <ORGANIZATION>Rio Grande Industries Inc.</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Monday</DATE> filed an
application with the <ORGANIZATION>Interstate Commerce Commission</ORGANIZATION> to acquire
<ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific Transportation Co.</ORGANIZATION> for <MONEY>$1 billion</MONEY> from <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe
Southern Pacific Corp</ORGANIZATION>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Rio Grande</ORGANIZATION> said in a news release that if the acquisition was
made, it planned to sell a <PERCENT>25 percent</PERCENT> share in the merged railroads
to a limited partnership affiliated with the investment firm <ORGANIZATION>Morgan
Stanley Group Inc</ORGANIZATION>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION> already has approved an expedited schedule for the
application, with a final decision expected in six months, <LOCATION>Rio
Grande</LOCATION> said.
   The application follows a formal purchase agreement that <LOCATION>Rio
Grande</LOCATION> entered into with <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp</ORGANIZATION>. Last year,
the <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION> ordered <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Southern</ORGANIZATION> to divest either the <ORGANIZATION>Southern
Pacific</ORGANIZATION> or the <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Railroad</ORGANIZATION>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Rio Grande</ORGANIZATION>'s action will affect <ORGANIZATION>Kansas City Southern Industries
Inc.</ORGANIZATION>'s rival bid of more than <MONEY>$1.25 billion</MONEY> for the <ORGANIZATION>Southern
Pacific</ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION>Joele Frank of Adams &amp; Rinehart</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, which
handles <ORGANIZATION>KCSI</ORGANIZATION>'s public relations.
   ``<LOCATION>Kansas City</LOCATION> is planning to ask the <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION> to choose which company
should acquire the <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION>, based on which would serve the
public interest the best,'' she said. ``They will ask that the <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION>
consider whether the bidder helps the competition, and also is
willing to pay a higher price.''
   <PERSON>Ms. Frank</PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION>KCSI</ORGANIZATION> should be aided in the <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION> deliberations by
having the higher offer.
   Rio Grande officials equally were confident their proposal would
win <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION> approval.
   ``We are confident that the commission will find this
single-line system covering both the southern and central rail
corridors will enhance competition for the benefit of shippers and
the public,'' said <PERSON>William Holtman</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Rio Grande</ORGANIZATION> chairman and chief
executive officer.
   <PERSON>Tom Saunders</PERSON>, chairman of the equity fund, said: ``The financial
commitment we are making is the strongest statement possible about
our confidence in the long-term viability of this venture.''
   The two lines will be an end-to-end joining of railroads whose
common points at <LOCATION>Ogden</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Herrington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kan.</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Kansas City</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Mo.</LOCATION>, will allow complete connection of the two systems, <LOCATION>Rio Grande</LOCATION>
said.
   <ORGANIZATION>Rio Grande</ORGANIZATION>'s proposal has been accompanied by a commitment to
honor existing labor contracts. The railroad also said it has
received the unanimous support of the general chairmen of all the
unions representing <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> workers.
   <PERSON>Roy Thiessen</PERSON>, vice president of marketing and sales for the
<LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Rio Grande Western</ORGANIZATION>, said shippers have expressed support
for the merger as well.
   ``It is clear that the public and customers are anxious to see
this acquisition approved promptly, without delays caused by third
parties,'' said <PERSON>Thiessen</PERSON>.

   <ORGANIZATION>Rio Grande Industries</ORGANIZATION> said it intends to make a bid for <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific Transportation Co.</ORGANIZATION> in order to merge the carrier with its <ORGANIZATION>Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western Railroad</ORGANIZATION> unit. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Rio Grande</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>Denver-based Anschutz Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, didn't specify a purchase price. 
Industry analysts have said <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> could sell for as much as <MONEY>$1 billion</MONEY>. 

   Rio Grande is the latest in a string of potential buyers to step forward since <DATE>June</DATE>, when the <ORGANIZATION>Interstate Commerce Commission</ORGANIZATION> rejected as anti-competitive the proposed merger of <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Atchison Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway</ORGANIZATION>. 

   The <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION> ordered the railroads' parent company, Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, to spin off one of the carriers. 

   Since then, <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION>'s employee unions, its managers and <ORGANIZATION>Kansas Southern Industries Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, another railroad concern, have said they are planning bids. 
So far, none have made specific proposals. 

   Rio Grande earlier discussed buying a portion of <LOCATION>San Francisco-based Southern Pacific</LOCATION>. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> officials declined to comment on any of the potential bidders. 
However, a spokesman said the company expects to comply with the <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION>'s order by the end of the year. 

   A <ORGANIZATION>Rio Grande-Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> merger would combine two of the oldest railroads in the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION>. 
Southern Pacific extends 13,000 miles from <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION> across the South and <LOCATION>Midwest</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Memphis</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Tenn</LOCATION>. 
Rio Grande stretches 2,400 miles across the <LOCATION>Rocky Mountains</LOCATION>. 

   Any bid from <ORGANIZATION>Rio Grande</ORGANIZATION> would require <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION> approval. 
A company spokesman said the railroad doesn't anticipate regulatory problems since "nowhere do the tracks of these two railroads run parallel."

   <ORGANIZATION>Kansas City Southern Industries Inc.</ORGANIZATION>
says it has asked the <ORGANIZATION>Interstate Commerce Commission</ORGANIZATION> to authorize
<ORGANIZATION>KCSI</ORGANIZATION>, and not the <ORGANIZATION>Denver Rio Grande Western Railway</ORGANIZATION>, to acquire and
operate the <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific Transportation Co</ORGANIZATION>.
   The application was based on the belief that it would be in the
best public interest for <ORGANIZATION>KCSI</ORGANIZATION> to own <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON>Landon
Rowland</PERSON>, president and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION>KCSI</ORGANIZATION>, on <DATE>Monday</DATE>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corporation</ORGANIZATION> has been required by the
<ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION> to divest the <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> because a merger between it and
the <LOCATION>Santa</LOCATION> Fe Railway would have essentially ended railroad
competition in the <LOCATION>Southwest</LOCATION> and other markets served by the two
railroads, <PERSON>Rowland</PERSON> said.
   ``<ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> chose to sell the <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific
to Denver Rio Grande</ORGANIZATION>, rather than to <LOCATION>Kansas City Southern</LOCATION>, for what
we believe to be purely anti-competitive reasons,'' he said.
   <ORGANIZATION>KCSI</ORGANIZATION>'s operating plan, filed <DATE>Monday</DATE> with the <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION>, calls for the
purchase of 547 modern locomotives over the next five years.
   ``In contrast, the <PERSON>Philip F. Anschutz</PERSON> interests, which control
the <ORGANIZATION>Denver Rio Grande</ORGANIZATION>, appear to treat the acquisition as primarily
a real estate play, and propose to buy only 40 new locomotives over
essentially the same period,'' he said.
   <PERSON>Samuel R. Freeman</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>Rio Grande</ORGANIZATION>'s vice president and general
counsel, said his company wouldn't neglect the <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION>. It
would lease most new equipment instead of buying it to capitalize
on financial and tax benefits, <PERSON>Freeman</PERSON> said.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Rio Grande</ORGANIZATION> runs across about 1,900 miles, from <LOCATION>Kansas City</LOCATION>
to <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION>. It hasn't revealed details for combining its small local
work force with that of the <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION>, which has about 280
employees.
   <DATE>Monday</DATE> was the deadline for comments about the <ORGANIZATION>Southern
Pacific</ORGANIZATION>'s proposed sale to be filed with regulators.
   Also opposing the deal were <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON>John Ashcroft</PERSON> and the
<LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION> Highway and <ORGANIZATION>Transportation Commission</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>Freeman</PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION>Rio Grande</ORGANIZATION>'s purchase was backed by most
shippers, regulators and other railroads.
   The <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION> expects to rule in mid-August on the sale plan.
   Regulators last <DATE>June</DATE> killed <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION>'s efforts
to merge the <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> with the <ORGANIZATION>Rio Grande Railway</ORGANIZATION>, which it
also owns. They feared that a merger of the two big lines, whose
tracks overlap in many areas, would stifle competition and increase
shipping rates.
   Early last year <LOCATION>Kansas City Southern</LOCATION> began a furious campaign to
buy the <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION>. But the lobbying didn't prevent <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe
Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> from naming the <LOCATION>Rio Grande</LOCATION> as the railroad's buyer
in late <DATE>December</DATE>.

The Santa Fe Fears a Rail Regulatory Relapse

   When <PERSON>John J. Schmidt</PERSON> in <DATE>1983</DATE> undertook to merge his <ORGANIZATION>Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway</ORGANIZATION> with the <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific Railroad</ORGANIZATION> he felt the two lines had a "manifest destiny" to become one. 
That's an old-fashioned expression applied to two railroads with a long and colorful history. 
The one laid track along the <LOCATION>Santa Fe</LOCATION> trail in Civil War days and the other, SP, was a key player in the post-Gold Rush development of <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>. 

   But alas, the <ORGANIZATION>Interstate Commerce Commission</ORGANIZATION> had other ideas. 
Overruling both the staff and chairman, four members of the commission voted last <DATE>July 24</DATE> to deny the merger. 
They had been convinced by the <ORGANIZATION>Justice Department</ORGANIZATION> and other intervenors that the merger would be "anticompetitive." 
So <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp.</ORGANIZATION> (SFSP), the already merged holding company, was forced to put <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific Railroad</ORGANIZATION> in trust and attempt to meet the <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION> objections. 

   SFSP has since exchanged trackage rights with four competitors, most particularly the big <ORGANIZATION>Union Pacific</ORGANIZATION>. 
Now <PERSON>Mr. Schmidt</PERSON>, SFSP chairman and chief executive, is asking the <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION> to reconsider. 

   "We're responding to what they found was necessary. 
To get the decision early is just vital. 
We've had the employees of both railroads hanging in limbo for over three and a half years; it's demoralizing to employees. 
If we have to unravel, there's going to be further dislocation of what the railroad structure is going to be like in the country and there'll be a fairly extended period of unsettled conditions. 
We thought we were pursuing what I call the manifest destiny of not only both railroads but of the merger scheme as conceived of under the <ORGANIZATION>National Transportation Policy</ORGANIZATION>. 

   "If we misconceived, what's going to happen and whom we sell one or both railroads to and how it will affect the national transportation system is a chapter that is unwritten yet. 
We know what our options are and they will be pursued, but we very, very much want this merger and we think it's good for enhancing rail competition among more viable competitors." 

   If the <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION>'s rejection came as a big surprise to <PERSON>Mr. Schmidt</PERSON>, he can perhaps be forgiven. 
When you look at a map of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> rail system there is indeed a certain tidiness to the idea of having six major rail systems, three in the <LOCATION>East</LOCATION> and three in the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Railway Co.</ORGANIZATION> (SPSF), the name planned for the railroad component of <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, would represent the southern tier in the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION>. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Union Pacific</ORGANIZATION> would be the middle tier and the <LOCATION>Burlington Northern</LOCATION> the top tier. 
In the East the three main systems would be newly privatized <ORGANIZATION>Conrail</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>CSX</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Norfolk Southern</ORGANIZATION>. 

   Years ago, there were hopes for a group of transcontinental railroads. 
But the main thrust since the rails were deregulated has been to try to revive the badly rundown system through cost cutting. 
And that is most quickly done by merging lines with parallel trackage and spinning off unprofitable branch lines to newly formed, and largely nonunion, short line companies. 

   Of course, that was exactly what the <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION> ruled against in the SPSF case, which is why its decision was such a big surprise. 
Up until then, <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> had come a long way in enlightening itself on the costs of economic regulation. 
Indeed, the main reason the deregulatory Staggers Act passed in <DATE>1980</DATE> was that the railroads were in such sad shape. 
Federal Railway Administrator <PERSON>John Riley</PERSON> notes that at that time roads accounting for one-quarter of the national trackage were in bankruptcy, 48,000 miles of track were under "slow orders," meaning they weren't safe for normal speeds, and the roads were losing 20 million tons of volume a year. 
Since deregulation, the railroads have made a comeback, but earnings are by no means spectacular. 

   The <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION>'s SPSF ruling helped fan fears of a reactionary re-regulatory movement, but those fears now have diminished some. 
The economic cost would be huge. 

   It's instructive to note that the original SPSF application envisioned savings to the public and the railroads themselves of nearly <MONEY>$288 million</MONEY> a year. 
<PERSON>Mr. Schmidt</PERSON> now estimates he has given up <MONEY>$39 million</MONEY> to other carriers in trackage deals. 
But the total savings now would be <MONEY>$294 million</MONEY>. 
For example, SPSF would be able to use <ORGANIZATION>Union Pacific</ORGANIZATION> trackage from <LOCATION>St. Louis</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>, saving itself a backhaul of 250 miles through <LOCATION>Kansas City</LOCATION>. 
That means "a lot, a lot of money." 

   But what about competition? 
The justification of regulation was that railroading was a "natural monopoly." 
That concept still gets much exercise in <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION> hearings and congressional debates. 
It doesn't take a genius to see that trucks are a big competitor for railroads. 
Yet the <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION> majority last year refused to consider trucks and based its decision solely on whether the SPSF merger would diminish rail-to-rail competition. 
There was an esoteric debate over whether trucks are competitive on hauls of over 1,000 miles, an issue Chairman <PERSON>Heather J. Gradison</PERSON> obviously found puzzling since the SPSF hauls a lot of freight less than 1,000 miles just as trucks do. 

   In fact, given the highly developed <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> transportation infrastructure, few if any shippers are truly "captive" to rails. 
The best case is made by electric utilities that have power plants served by coal-hauling roads, but big utilities don't lack bargaining power. 
For one thing, the Staggers Act now allows long-term contracts between shippers and railroads. 
That, incredibly, was not allowed under the old law because <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> had once decided that volume discounts to big shippers were "unfair." 
In drawing up contracts, the relevant fact is that both the railroad and the utility need each other. 
Some utilities, particularly in the West, have surplus capacity, meaning they can switch to other sources if hauling costs at a single plant rise. 

   "I would love to get the same return on carrying coals to <ORGANIZATION>Newcastle</ORGANIZATION> that <ORGANIZATION>Newcastle</ORGANIZATION> gets, <ORGANIZATION>Newcastle</ORGANIZATION> being the utilities," says <PERSON>Mr. Schmidt</PERSON>. 
Utilities have a much higher return on capital than railroads, he says. 

   There also is broader competition. 
"If you don't move the traffic you don't get any money and if the guy you move it for doesn't make any money, you're not going to move it for long," <PERSON>Mr. Schmidt</PERSON> observes, quite plausibly. 
If the customer has competition, which he usually has, the railroad has competition, too. 

   Railroads have their own hang-ups, <PERSON>Mr. Schmidt</PERSON> says. 
"Rail attitudes have been terrible in the past because it was all regulation. 
You go to the commission and say my costs have gone up, and gee, the labor boys won again and you raise the rate and you raise the rate and you raise the rate and what is happening is that most of the traffic that had an option is going, going, gone to trucks and the pipelines. 
And then the people that couldn't go anywhere, they were trapped. 
Staggers came along to stop that ball game." 

   Clearly, things have been looking up in railroading and the transportation business in general. 
The trains are getting up to speed again. 
Systems are being rationalized and the competition is fierce among all modes of transportation, which can only mean very large savings for the public. 
Another turndown of the SPSF merger, which seems unlikely given the support it now has picked up from shippers and even competing roads, would be a disturbing reversal. 
But stranger things have happened in the wonderful world of transportation regulation.

   Burlington Northern Inc., which this week announced a new
rail-barge service, will be challenging a trio of railroad
rivals for the fast growing trade between the U.S. and
Mexico.
   The Fort Worth, Texas, railroad company operates the
longest rail system in the U.S., but it must rely on the
rails of competing carriers to reach the Mexican market.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The new service is designed to challenge <ORGANIZATION>Union Pacific
Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Rio Grande Industries</ORGANIZATION>' <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific Transportation
Co.</ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Pacific Corp.</ORGANIZATION> for the half-billion-dollar
rail market, which is estimated to be growing <PERCENT>10%</PERCENT> a year. An
anticipated free-trade agreement between the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>
is expected to further accelerate the market growth.
   "<LOCATION>Burlington Northern</LOCATION> is the only one of the big Western
railroads that doesn't have a direct track connection to
<LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>," says <PERSON>William J. Rennicke</PERSON>, a vice president of
<ORGANIZATION>Temple, Barker &amp; Sloane</ORGANIZATION>, a transportation consulting firm in
<LOCATION>Lexington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass</LOCATION>. The rail-barge service planned by <ORGANIZATION>Burlington
Northern</ORGANIZATION> is "a very creative way to extend its rail network
and service into a growing market and bypass its three
Western rail competitors."
   <ORGANIZATION>Burlington Northern</ORGANIZATION> said yesterday that it and <ORGANIZATION>Grupo
Protexa S.A.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Monterrey</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>, are equal partners in a
joint venture that will provide the rail-barge service by
mid-1992. The service, the first of its kind between the two
countries, will allow <LOCATION>Burlington Northern</LOCATION> freight cars to
roll onto <ORGANIZATION>Protexa</ORGANIZATION> rail barges at <LOCATION>Texas Gulf</LOCATION> ports. The barges
will link with the Mexican rail network at the east coast
ports of <ORGANIZATION>Altamira</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Veracruz</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Coatzacoalcos</LOCATION>.
   The joint venture, <ORGANIZATION>Protexa Burlington International S.A.</ORGANIZATION>,
to be based in <LOCATION>Mexico City</LOCATION>, will represent a "substantial
pooling of assets," <ORGANIZATION>Burlington Northern</ORGANIZATION> said. The joint
venture will include rail cars, locomotives, tugboats and
barges equipped with rails for carrying freight cars.
   <ORGANIZATION>Burlington Northern</ORGANIZATION> officials declined to estimate
investment and revenues. But <PERSON>Anthony Hatch</PERSON>, an analyst at
<ORGANIZATION>PaineWebber Inc.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, said he expects the rail-barge
service to eventually generate revenues of about <MONEY>$100 million</MONEY>
a year.
   In announcing the new rail-barge service, <LOCATION>Burlington
Northern</LOCATION> said it hoped to alleviate the "ever-present, and
increasing, border and port congestion in <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>."
   The company said the new service will initially haul grain
cars from the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> but would be expanded to
transport products from raw materials to finished goods.
   Executives at railroads with direct track connections to
<LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> played down the competitive threat from the planned
rail-barge service. <PERSON>Rollin D. Bredenberg</PERSON>, vice
president-Mexico of <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific Transportation</ORGANIZATION>, said the
new service would allow <LOCATION>Burlington Northern</LOCATION> to increase its
market share at the expense of grain presently going by water
to the east coast of <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>.
   "I think <ORGANIZATION>Burlington Northern</ORGANIZATION> will still access the
northern and western markets of <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> using <ORGANIZATION>Southern
Pacific</ORGANIZATION>'s gateway connections to <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>," said <PERSON>Mr.
Bredenberg</PERSON>. "The rail-barge {service} will allow <LOCATION>Burlington
Northern</LOCATION> to compete with water transportation of grain to
points in central and southern <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>."
   A spokesman for <ORGANIZATION>Union Pacific</ORGANIZATION>'s rail unit, responding to
the <LOCATION>Burlington Northern</LOCATION> comment about border congestion, said
it has eliminated congestion problems at its <LOCATION>Laredo</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>,
gateway to <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>. The company said changes in its train
operations and customs procedures have opened the flow of its
rail traffic across the border. In addition, <ORGANIZATION>Union Pacific</ORGANIZATION> is
currently leasing 30 locomotives to <ORGANIZATION>Ferrocarriles Nacionales</ORGANIZATION>
de <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> to meet increasing demands for rail transportation
between the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>.

   <ORGANIZATION>Kansas City Southern Industries Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and a union representing employees of <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific Transportation Co.</ORGANIZATION> asked the <ORGANIZATION>Interstate Commerce Commission</ORGANIZATION> <DATE>Monday</DATE> to block the sale of the <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific to Rio Grande Industries Inc</ORGANIZATION>. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Kansas City Southern</ORGANIZATION>'s bid for the <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> was rejected by the railroad's parent, Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, last year. 
<ORGANIZATION>Kansas City Southern</ORGANIZATION> is hoping its offer will get a second airing, this time in the governmental arena. 
All rail mergers must be approved by the <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION>. 

   The employee group, meanwhile, asked the commission to reject <ORGANIZATION>Rio Grande</ORGANIZATION>'s merger application and support a bid by the <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> employees. 
The group represents members of an employee stock ownership plan who hold about a <PERCENT>1%</PERCENT> stake in <LOCATION>San Francisco-based Southern Pacific</LOCATION>. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> agreed to sell the <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific to Rio Grande</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>Denver-based Anschutz Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, for <MONEY>$1.02 billion</MONEY> in cash last <DATE>December</DATE>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Rio Grande</ORGANIZATION> also agreed to assume <MONEY>$780 million</MONEY> in <LOCATION>Southern Pacific</LOCATION> debt. 

   Although the other bidders never disclosed the amounts of their offers, <ORGANIZATION>Kansas City Southern</ORGANIZATION> reportedly offered a price close to <ORGANIZATION>Rio Grande</ORGANIZATION>'s, but in cash and notes. 
The employees' bid was around <MONEY>$900 million</MONEY>, an official familar with the offers said. 

   Originally, <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> intended to merge the <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> with its <ORGANIZATION>Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway</ORGANIZATION> unit. 
But the <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION> denied the merger on anti-competitive grounds <DATE>last June</DATE> and ordered the company to divest itself of one of the railroad units. 

   <DATE>Monday</DATE> was the deadline for filing objections to the proposed sale. 

   Rio Grande's application received a boost <DATE>Friday</DATE> when the <ORGANIZATION>Justice Department</ORGANIZATION>, in an opinion filed with the <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION>, said it saw no reason for the agency to disapprove the sale. 

   Rejecting <ORGANIZATION>Kansas City Southern</ORGANIZATION>'s arguments, the <ORGANIZATION>Justice Department</ORGANIZATION> said it would be "unnecessary and burdensome" for the <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION> to choose between two buyers who each meet the divestiture criteria. 
"The choice should be up to <LOCATION>Santa Fe</LOCATION>," the department said. 

   The <ORGANIZATION>Kansas City Southern</ORGANIZATION>'s chances were further imperiled when a <LOCATION>South Dakota</LOCATION> federal jury recently ordered the company to pay the state between <MONEY>$243 million</MONEY> and <MONEY>$611 million</MONEY> for antitrust and contract-interference violations related to a coal-slurry pipeline project there. 
<ORGANIZATION>Kansas City Southern</ORGANIZATION> has asked the court to set aside the verdict and to order a new trial.

FT  01 JUL 94 / International Company News: Two US rail groups plan to merge
in Dollars 2.8bn deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Two of the biggest railroads in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>Burlington Northern</LOCATION> and the
<ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Pacific</ORGANIZATION>, yesterday announced that they planned to merge in a deal
worth Dollars 2.8bn.
If allowed, the merger will create by far the biggest railroad in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>,
joining two complementary networks spreading from the west coast to the
midwest. It will be called the <ORGANIZATION>Burlington Northern Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION>.
However, the deal faces an investigation by the <ORGANIZATION>Interstate Commerce
Commission</ORGANIZATION>, a federal regulatory body which seven years ago ordered the
unbundling of a merger between <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION>, another
railroad in the same region, on the grounds that it was anti-competitive.
The proposed deal will take the form of a takeover of <ORGANIZATION>Sante Fe Pacific</ORGANIZATION> by
<ORGANIZATION>Burlington Northern</ORGANIZATION>, the bigger of the two companies. <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> shareholders
will receive 0.27 of a <LOCATION>Burlington</LOCATION> share for each <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> share they hold,
putting a value of Dollars 2.8bn on <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION>.
In other respects, the deal looks like a true merger of two healthy and
profitable companies. Burlington made net profits of Dollars 296m on
turnover of Dollars 4.7bn last year, while <LOCATION>Santa</LOCATION> Fe made net profits of
Dollars 338m on turnover of Dollars 2.7bn.
Although passenger trains in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> are operated by the state-owned <ORGANIZATION>Amtrak</ORGANIZATION>,
all the country's track infrastructure and freight trains are owned and
operated by private sector railroad companies.
Recently the freight railroads have enjoyed a surge in profitability caused
by a combination of growth in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> economy, big increases in efficiency
and productivity, and a lack of capacity in the road haulage industry
resulting from driver shortages.
West of the <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Burlington</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> are two of four big
railroads. The others are <ORGANIZATION>Southern and Union Pacific</ORGANIZATION>.
<LOCATION>Burlington</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> said the proposed merger was not anti-competitive
because their networks were complementary rather than competing, connecting
with one another at the ends of their routes. The combined railroad would
compete mainly with <ORGANIZATION>Union Pacific</ORGANIZATION>.
The two companies said the merger would result in substantial cost savings
though operational improvements, higher traffic densities and reduced
administrative costs.
Customers would benefit from being able to use a single railroad to reach a
wider range of destinations, eliminating the costs and delays associated
with interchanges.

<TEXT>
   The <ORGANIZATION>Interstate Commerce Commission</ORGANIZATION> today
postponed a decision on whether to approve a <MONEY>$110 million</MONEY> merger
that would make the regional <ORGANIZATION>Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad Co.</ORGANIZATION> a
part of the giant <ORGANIZATION>Union Pacific Corp</ORGANIZATION>.
   <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Heather J. Gradison</PERSON> canceled a scheduled vote,
saying that Commissioner <PERSON>J.J. Simmons III</PERSON> had failed to give his
fellow commission members adequate time to review his proposed
conditions for the merger.
   Under agency rules, commissioners must distribute any amendments
the day before a planned vote. <PERSON>Simmons</PERSON> did not outline his
proposals at today's brief session and, under commission rules,
amendments are not made public until they are discussed at a
meeting.
   No new meeting to consider the merger was scheduled immediately,
and <PERSON>Al Brown</PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said it was unlikely that another
vote will be set before next week.
   The railroads contend that consolidating operations would
provide improved service at lower costs and ensure reliable
long-term transportation, especially for Midwestern grain shippers
relying on the 3,100-mile MKT system known as the ``Katy.''
   Other railroads have questioned whether the proposed merger will
reduce competition, because the Katy's lines generally parallel
some <ORGANIZATION>Union Pacific</ORGANIZATION> routes from <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION> to southern
<LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Gulf Coast</ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION>Union Pacific</ORGANIZATION> is a 21,500-mile
network formed by a rail merger six years ago.
   To address those concerns, <ORGANIZATION>Union Pacific</ORGANIZATION> has offered competing
railroads the rights to use some trackage on proposed merger routes.
   Without the merger, the <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION> has been told, the financially
ailing Katy could face problems surviving against bigger
competitors. Operating income for the Katy declined from <MONEY>$37
million</MONEY> in <DATE>1981</DATE> to <MONEY>$5 million</MONEY> in <DATE>1986</DATE>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Union Pacific</ORGANIZATION>, the nation's third largest railroad system in
terms of track mileage, serves about 20 states with routes from <LOCATION>Los
Angeles</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Seattle</LOCATION> in the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New
Orleans</LOCATION>. The company was formed in <DATE>1982</DATE> with the merger of the
<ORGANIZATION>Union Pacific</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Missouri Pacific and Western Pacific</ORGANIZATION> railroads.
   The Katy serves six states, with mostly north-south routes
running from <LOCATION>Omaha</LOCATION> to the <ORGANIZATION>Gulf Coast</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>. A separate east-west
route extends between <LOCATION>Kansas City</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>St. Louis</LOCATION>.
   Union Pacific, which filed an application in <DATE>November 1986</DATE>
seeking government approval of the Katy acquisition, says the
merger would produce operating savings of <MONEY>$61 million</MONEY> a year.
Company officials say grain shippers would benefit through a
shorter, more direct single-line route to export markets in <LOCATION>Texas
Gulf</LOCATION> ports.
   However, the merger would eliminate about 1,100 Katy jobs
because of closings of rail yards and repair shops. <ORGANIZATION>Union Pacific</ORGANIZATION>
also plans to abandon 405 miles of track, mostly operated by <PERSON>Katy</PERSON>,
if the merger is approved.
   <ORGANIZATION>Union Pacific</ORGANIZATION> has taken steps to ease objections to the merger.
For example, the company has agreed to pay <MONEY>$1 million</MONEY> to the
southeast Kansas community of <LOCATION>Parson</LOCATION> in exchange for not opposing
the merger. The city would lose about 300 Katy jobs, with an
estimated <MONEY>$8 million</MONEY> payroll, under the merger.

   The <ORGANIZATION>Interstate Commerce Commission</ORGANIZATION> said it wouldn't decide whether to reconsider its rejection of the proposed merger of the <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> railroads until <DATE>March 2</DATE>. 

   The commission said that reopening the case "may well be appropriate," but that it needed additional data from the railroads. 
In particular, it requested information on the steps the <LOCATION>Santa Fe</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> are taking to lessen anti-competitive problems posed by the merger. 
The commission raised questions of competition last <DATE>July</DATE> in rejecting the merger -- a move that stunned the railroad industry. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, the Chicago-based holding company that owns the <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> and holds the <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> in trust, has reached agreements with a number of other railroads in an effort to win support for the proposed merger. 
For example, it agreed to give <ORGANIZATION>Union Pacific Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western Railroad</ORGANIZATION> rights to operate on some of the units' lines. 

   But the commission said it hasn't received sufficient information on the settlements, and warned: "We won't reopen on the basis of speculation that ongoing negotiations might produce an acceptable solution sometime in the future. 
The petition to reopen will be granted only if applicants can show in sufficient detail what their proposal is." 

   <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp.</ORGANIZATION> was created in <DATE>December 1983</DATE>, when <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Industries Inc.</ORGANIZATION> merged with <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific Co.</ORGANIZATION> in a <MONEY>$6.4 billion</MONEY> transaction. 
While the energy, natural resources and construction operations of the two companies were immediately combined, the two railroads were kept separate pending <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION> approval.

   <ORGANIZATION>Kansas City Southern Railway Co.</ORGANIZATION> said it asked the <ORGANIZATION>Interstate Commerce Commission</ORGANIZATION> to uphold the rejection of the proposed merger between the <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION>Santa Fe</LOCATION> railroads. 

   In its petition, <ORGANIZATION>Kansas City Southern</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>Kansas City Southern Industries Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, said it would make a bid to buy <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific Railroad</ORGANIZATION> within 60 days if the commission doesn't overturn itself. 
<ORGANIZATION>Kansas City Southern</ORGANIZATION> said it has retained <ORGANIZATION>Lazard Freres &amp; Co.</ORGANIZATION> to advise it on a bid for the railroad, but offered no details about any possible proposal. 

   Meanwhile, two government agencies voiced their opinions again on the merger. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Department of Transportation</ORGANIZATION>, which previously supported the merger, sent a letter to the commission yesterday reaffirming that support. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Justice Department</ORGANIZATION>, which has previously opposed the merger, reasserted its opposition. 

   The commission jolted the railroad industry last <DATE>July</DATE> by blocking the merger of the <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> on the grounds that it would be anti-competitive. 
The merger, which was opposed by several railroads, including the <LOCATION>Kansas City Southern</LOCATION>, would create the nation's third-largest rail system. 

   Since <DATE>July</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, the parent of the railroad combination, has satisfied most of the opponents of the merger by offering traffic and pricing concessions. 
In <DATE>December</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Southern</ORGANIZATION> appealed the commission's ruling. 
Railroad industry experts said they expect a commission decision on the <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> appeal soon. 

   If the appeal is rejected, <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> would have to divest itself of one of the railroads under a time schedule and in a manner approved by the commission. 
In filings last year with the <ORGANIZATION>Securities and Exchange Commission</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> had net assets of <MONEY>$2.31 billion</MONEY> and <DATE>1985</DATE> revenue of <MONEY>$2.55 billion</MONEY>. 
For the <DATE>first nine months of 1986</DATE>, the railroad had revenue of <MONEY>$1.78 billion</MONEY>. 

   In an interview, <PERSON>Landon H. Rowland</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Kansas City Southern</ORGANIZATION>'s president and chief executive officer, said his company would bid for the <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> once the merger question is cleared up by the commission. 
He declined to say how much <LOCATION>Kansas City Southern</LOCATION> was prepared to bid for the railroad. 
"From our data and our familiarity with that system, we think the property, set free, can make money," <PERSON>Mr. Rowland</PERSON> said.

   Major airlines, still attempting to prop up sagging
earnings, slashed fares 50% on coast-to-coast flights.
   The $198 round-trip fares between some East Coast and West
Coast cities -- initiated by Trans World Airlines and quickly
followed by other major carriers -- are among the lowest
offered during the past decade for transcontinental travel.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "This is the one that will bring people out of the
woodwork," predicted <PERSON>Thomas Nulty</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Associated
Travel Services Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Santa Ana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, travel agency.
   However, industry analysts warned that while the lower
fares promise to spur travel, their effect on earnings is
unknown. "Whether or not this will generate profits, I'm not
sure," said <PERSON>Edward Starkman</PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION>PaineWebber Inc</ORGANIZATION>.
   Net income continues to dive for most airlines. According
to the <ORGANIZATION>Air Transport Association</ORGANIZATION>, the industry trade group,
airlines had a <MONEY>$1 billion</MONEY> loss in the first half of the year,
compared with a loss of <MONEY>$63 million</MONEY> in the <DATE>first half of last
year</DATE>.
   "Now airlines are looking at their projected earnings for
the <DATE>fall</DATE> and they see that they have to do something," <PERSON>Mr.
Nulty</PERSON> said. "This will get travelers very excited."
   With the industry's <DATE>summer</DATE> peak travel season behind it,
<ORGANIZATION>TWA</ORGANIZATION> introduced the lower fares over the <DATE>weekend</DATE> "to try to
entice people to fly during this time of year when travel is
normally down," a <ORGANIZATION>TWA</ORGANIZATION> spokesman said.
   Aimed at leisure travelers, the <LOCATION>Mount Kisco</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>,
carrier's offer covers flights between <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Newark</LOCATION> on the <LOCATION>East Coast</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Ontario</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Santa Ana</LOCATION> on the <LOCATION>West Coast</LOCATION>. The
tickets are non-refundable, require seven-day advance sales,
and must be purchased by <DATE>Thursday</DATE> for non-holiday travel
between <DATE>Sept. 23</DATE> and <DATE>Dec. 15</DATE>.
   "This is as low as it goes for transcontinental travel,"
said <PERSON>Samuel Buttrick</PERSON>, an industry analyst at <ORGANIZATION>Kidder, Peabody
&amp; Co.</ORGANIZATION> "What I'd be wary of is that you want to control the
spread of this kind of pricing."
   Yesterday, as <ORGANIZATION>TWA</ORGANIZATION> began offering its fare cuts, <ORGANIZATION>United
Airlines</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>UAL Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION>American
Airlines</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>AMR Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Fort Worth</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, not only
matched the <ORGANIZATION>TWA</ORGANIZATION> offer, but also added additional cities to
the promotion.
   <ORGANIZATION>United</ORGANIZATION> said it will add <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Long Beach</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Burbank</LOCATION> -- all in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> -- on the <LOCATION>West Coast</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>White
Plains</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New Haven</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Conn.</LOCATION>, on the <LOCATION>East Coast</LOCATION>. "<ORGANIZATION>TWA</ORGANIZATION>
rolls out a shotgun and <ORGANIZATION>United</ORGANIZATION> rolls out a tank," said <PERSON>Mr.
Starkman</PERSON>. "This industry is just blistering competitive,
especially when bookings aren't there." Until recently, major
airlines would hardly have followed suit on <ORGANIZATION>TWA</ORGANIZATION>'s promotion.
   In addition to matching the <ORGANIZATION>TWA</ORGANIZATION> offer, <ORGANIZATION>American Airlines</ORGANIZATION>
said it is offering <MONEY>$218</MONEY> round-trip fares between the <LOCATION>East
Coast</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION>. Industry sources say they
expect American to drop those prices to <MONEY>$198</MONEY>, to remain in
step with <ORGANIZATION>United</ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION>Delta Air Lines</ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>, and
<ORGANIZATION>USAir</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>USAir Group Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Arlington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Va.</LOCATION>, also moved
to match the <ORGANIZATION>TWA</ORGANIZATION> promotion, and likely will extend their
offers to the additional cities.

   <ORGANIZATION>Kansas City Southern Industries Inc.</ORGANIZATION> said it is in preliminary talks to acquire the <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> railroad unit of <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp</ORGANIZATION>. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Kansas City Southern</ORGANIZATION> first expressed interest in buying the <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> unit in <DATE>January</DATE>. 
The talks mark the first time that the Chicago-based company has agreed to provide information about the unit to <ORGANIZATION>Kansas City Southern</ORGANIZATION>. 
"We are seriously negotiating," said <PERSON>Donald L. Graf</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Kansas City Southern</ORGANIZATION> senior vice president of finance. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Kansas City Southern</ORGANIZATION> said it is mulling "certain proposals" that have been submitted to it by <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Kansas City Southern</ORGANIZATION>, a railroad and data processing concern, said it expects to respond to the proposals in the next few weeks. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> was ordered by the <ORGANIZATION>Interstate Commerce Commission</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>June</DATE> to sell one of its two railroad units. 
The diversified railroad holding company is widely believed to be interested in selling the <LOCATION>San Francisco-based Southern Pacific</LOCATION> unit in order to retain the more profitable Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION>Atchison Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway</ORGANIZATION> unit. 
Some railroad analysts have estimated that the <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> unit could attract a bid of more than <MONEY>$1 billion</MONEY>. 

   In <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> said the company "would consider an offer from <LOCATION>Kansas City Southern</LOCATION>," but wouldn't comment on the talks. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Kansas City Southern</ORGANIZATION> is the only railroad operator so far that has publicly expressed interest in <LOCATION>Southern Pacific</LOCATION>, but it has yet to make a specific offer. 
Last month, a group of railroad unions representing <LOCATION>Southern Pacific</LOCATION> employees said it is fashioning a proposal to buy the unit. 

   In addition, <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> management is exploring a leveraged buy-out of the unit. 
In a leveraged buy-out, a small group of investors acquires a company largely with debt that ultimately is retired with money generated by the acquired company. 

   An acquisition of <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> would open the way into <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION> for <ORGANIZATION>Kansas City Southern</ORGANIZATION>. 
The <LOCATION>Kansas City</LOCATION>, Mo.-based concern currently operates a north-south line between <LOCATION>Kansas City</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Gulf of Mexico</LOCATION>, and an east-west line between <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New Orleans</LOCATION>. 

   <PERSON>Landon H. Rowland</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Kansas City Southern</ORGANIZATION> president and chief executive officer, said late yesterday that if the company buys the railroad it probably would give closely held <ORGANIZATION>Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western Railroad Co.</ORGANIZATION> access to <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION>'s central <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> operation. 
He declined to elaborate. 

   An acquisition might help <ORGANIZATION>Kansas City Southern</ORGANIZATION> management ward off an unwanted suitor by making the company harder to swallow. 
In <DATE>August</DATE>, a group led by <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> real estate developer <PERSON>Howard Kaskel</PERSON> disclosed that it held a <PERCENT>7.9%</PERCENT> stake in <LOCATION>Kansas City Southern</LOCATION> and asked for regulatory approval to acquire control of the company. 

   In composite trading on the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Kansas City Southern</ORGANIZATION>'s stock fell <MONEY>87.5 cents</MONEY> to close yesterday at <MONEY>$77.375</MONEY> a share. 
<ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> shares closed at <MONEY>$51.50</MONEY>, down <MONEY>50 cents</MONEY>, also on the <ORGANIZATION>Big Board</ORGANIZATION>. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> was formed in <DATE>1983</DATE> through the merger of two railroad parent companies. 
In <DATE>June</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>Interstate Commerce Commission</ORGANIZATION> cited anti-competitive concerns to finally end the company's four-year struggle to combine the railroad units. 
The company has until <DATE>Sept. 28</DATE> to submit a two-year railroad divestiture plan to the federal agency.

   Railroads Turn
   To Cutting Costs
   For Profit Gains

   Growth of 5% to 7% Is Seen
   In the Second Quarter;
   Industrial Freight Eased

<LP>
   The railroad industry, turning to cost cuts to offset
continuing slow industrial freight shipments, is expected to
post average second-quarter earnings gains of 5% to 7%.
   For the expected strongest performer, Burlington Northern
Inc., earnings growth reflected robust coal and grain
shipments and the company's limited exposure to the vagaries
of new automobile shipments. But even railroads that are more
heavily dependent upon industrial freight shipments fared
reasonably well, analysts said, reflecting vigorous
cost-cutting.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "The railroads' improved efficiency is boosting earnings
in a lackluster economy," said <PERSON>Gary Yablon</PERSON>, an analyst at
<ORGANIZATION>Wertheim Schroder &amp; Co.</ORGANIZATION>, who expects the group's
<DATE>second-quarter</DATE> profit from continuing operations "to be up in
the mid-single digits." <PERSON>Mr. Yablon</PERSON> said railroads have
tightened scheduling of freight trains, lowered car-hire
costs, reduced manpower, cut material use, and reduced
little-used track.
   A <LOCATION>Burlington Northern</LOCATION> spokesman said the company is
"comfortable" with analysts' estimates that <DATE>second-quarter</DATE>
net income was about <MONEY>81 cents</MONEY> a share compared with <MONEY>74 cents</MONEY>
a share in the year-earlier period. The spokesman said
continued growth in coal shipments reflected new contracts
with utilities in the railroad's territory and test shipments
of low-sulfur Western coal to utilities in the <LOCATION>Midwest</LOCATION> and
East concerned about more stringent air pollution standards.
He added that <ORGANIZATION>Burlington Northern</ORGANIZATION> benefited from higher
shipments of corn to <LOCATION>West Coast</LOCATION> ports from the <LOCATION>Midwest</LOCATION>.
   <ORGANIZATION>CSX Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, the only member of the group to disclose
results, reported last week that <DATE>second-quarter</DATE> net income
dropped <PERCENT>28%</PERCENT>. However, <ORGANIZATION>CSX</ORGANIZATION>'s earnings from continuing
operations rose <PERCENT>20%</PERCENT>, reflecting improved results at rail,
barging and container shipping units.
   Analysts said that they expect <ORGANIZATION>Consolidated Rail Corp.</ORGANIZATION> to
post moderately higher earnings but that per-share earnings
for <ORGANIZATION>Union Pacific Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Norfolk Southern Corp.</ORGANIZATION> will be
flat.
   Some analysts say rail operations were disappointing at
<ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Pacific Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, which faces tough competition for
freight from trucks and other railroads. Estimates of <ORGANIZATION>Santa
Fe</ORGANIZATION>'s <DATE>second-quarter</DATE> earnings range from nil to <MONEY>two cents</MONEY> a
share. In the <DATE>1989 quarter</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> had net of <MONEY>$2.7 million</MONEY>,
or <MONEY>two cents</MONEY> a share. A <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> spokesman wouldn't comment
on analysts' projections.
   Rail carloadings at the major railroads were up <PERCENT>1.3%</PERCENT>,
according to the <ORGANIZATION>Association of American Railroads</ORGANIZATION>. Shipments
of coal rose <PERCENT>5.8%</PERCENT>, chemicals were up <PERCENT>3.6%</PERCENT>, and metals
increased <PERCENT>3.2%</PERCENT>. Grain carloads were off about half a percent.
Carloadings of some higher-value freight were down, with
motor vehicles declining <PERCENT>4%</PERCENT>, lumber <PERCENT>8.3%</PERCENT> and paper less than
<PERCENT>1%</PERCENT>.
   Some analysts were cheered by the overall traffic gain.
"At this time a year ago tonnage was sliding, but now tonnage
is improving," said <PERSON>Andras Petery</PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION>Morgan
Stanley &amp; Co</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>Michael Lloyd</PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION>Salomon Brothers Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, said
he is encouraged by rail shipments of finished automobiles,
which improved toward the <DATE>end of the second quarter</DATE> after a
very weak beginning. However, <PERSON>Mr. Lloyd</PERSON> believes that the
improvement partly reflects inventory -- building in
anticipation of a strike by the <ORGANIZATION>United Auto Workers</ORGANIZATION> union,
whose contract expires in <DATE>September</DATE>.
   "I'm worried that the stocks of the railroads will respond
positively to near-term traffic trends, trapping investors
for possible disappointment this <DATE>fall</DATE>," <PERSON>Mr. Lloyd</PERSON> said.
   When <ORGANIZATION>CSX</ORGANIZATION> reported that <DATE>second-quarter</DATE> net dropped to <MONEY>$109
million</MONEY> from <MONEY>$151 million</MONEY>, <ORGANIZATION>CSX</ORGANIZATION> said that earnings in the <DATE>1989</DATE>
second period were inflated by gains from the sale of
subsidiaries. <ORGANIZATION>CSX</ORGANIZATION> said rail pretax operating profit rose
<PERCENT>7.8%</PERCENT>, reflecting improved coal tonnage that offset the extra
expense of an expanded locomotive repair program. Auto
traffic, while not reaching levels of the year-ago quarter,
improved sharply from the first period of <DATE>1990</DATE>, the company
said. <ORGANIZATION>CSX</ORGANIZATION> said operating profit rose <PERCENT>40%</PERCENT> at its
container-shipping unit, <ORGANIZATION>Sea-Land Service Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, while
operating profit jumped <PERCENT>25%</PERCENT> at the barge unit, reflecting
strong coal shipments and expanded operations at the marine
construction division.
   Some analysts expect <ORGANIZATION>Conrail</ORGANIZATION> to report <DATE>second-quarter</DATE> net
income of <MONEY>$1.30</MONEY> to <MONEY>$1.40</MONEY> a share compared with net of <MONEY>$1.19</MONEY> a
share a year ago. One analyst said <DATE>second-quarter</DATE> results
included an after-tax gain of about <MONEY>21 cents</MONEY> a share from
sale of a branch line. <ORGANIZATION>Conrail</ORGANIZATION> officials wouldn't comment on
analysts' estimates other than to say that traffic levels are
"relatively flat."
   Union Pacific officials said per-share earnings were about
the same as the <MONEY>$1.41</MONEY> a share earned in the <DATE>1989</DATE> second
period, but net income fell slightly, reflecting higher
interest expense related to a share-repurchase program. The
officials cited earnings improvements at its rail, truck,
hazardous waste and real estate units. The officials said
earnings of the company's oil and gas unit won't match
after-tax earnings of <MONEY>$55 million</MONEY> in the year-ago <DATE>quarter</DATE>,
which included a <MONEY>$17 million</MONEY> gain on gas contract
settlements. Higher gas volumes in the recent quarter offset
price declines in oil and gas and flat oil volumes, the
officials said.
   They added that the rail unit benefited from a <PERCENT>1%</PERCENT>
improvement in carloadings and a reduction in railroad work
force to 31,500 from 32,800 a year ago.
   <ORGANIZATION>Norfolk Southern</ORGANIZATION> wouldn't comment on analysts' projections
that net income was flat at <MONEY>99 cents</MONEY> a share.

<TEXT>     Last vestiges of company;  "We're mindful that these are the last vestiges
of a company that was there when <LOCATION>Sacramento</LOCATION> was just a village," SP spokesman
<PERSON>Jerry Pera</PERSON> said.;    "But <LOCATION>Sacramento</LOCATION> isn't the railroad hub like it was then,"
he added. "We could liken the move to many other things that have changed in
society since then.";    <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> has evolved since <ORGANIZATION>Stanford</ORGANIZATION> and
co-founders <PERSON>Charles Crocker</PERSON>, <PERSON>Mark Hopkins</PERSON> and <PERSON>Collis P. Huntington</PERSON> -- known as
"the Big Four" to admirers, as "robber barons" to critics -- built the
nation's first transcontinental railroad.;    <DATE>Today</DATE>, their corporate legacy is
struggling in a modern railroad era of mergers and reorganizations, heavy
debt, tough competition and different transportation needs.;    "It's
certainly no secret that <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> is having financial difficulties,"
<PERSON>Pera</PERSON> said.;    145 employees laid off;  Those problems are reflected in the
company's decision last week to lay off 145 workers in <LOCATION>Sacramento</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Pera</PERSON> said
the action is necessary because there is not enough work for the employees,
who overhaul locomotives and make other heavy-duty repairs.;    The workers
could be recalled if more work becomes available, <PERSON>Pera</PERSON> said -- although the
shop eventually will be closed and moved to Denver.;    "Everyone knows that
<ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> is struggling, and these layoffs are very clearly to reduce
costs," he said. "But there is no conscious effort to sell off properties or
lay off people just simply to pay down debt.";    Nevertheless, debt hangs
heavy over SP. Denver billionaire <PERSON>Philip Anschutz</PERSON>, who bought the railroad
from <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp.</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1988</DATE> for <MONEY>$1 billion</MONEY>, was left with a
debt of <MONEY>$1.7 billion.</MONEY>;    Efforts to slash debt;  To reduce the debt, the
company that once was the largest landholder in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> has been selling
unused property. In <DATE>1989</DATE>, SP sold a total of 5,800 acres for <MONEY>$350 million</MONEY>;
last year, the sale of track lines in the <LOCATION>Los Angeles Basin</LOCATION> to transit
officials brought <MONEY>$450 million.</MONEY>;    SP also has a letter of intent to sell 60
miles of lines stretching from <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION> for <MONEY>$300 million</MONEY>. The
company's historic <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> headquarters has been put on the block,
although it is not being actively marketed during the current real estate
slump, SP spokesman <PERSON>Mike Brown</PERSON> said.;    Five years ago, the company also
embarked on a plan to reduce its workforce of 30,000 by one-third. Today, SP
has 21,800 employees, <PERSON>Pera</PERSON> said.;    "Most of those are happening through
attrition . . . or layoffs if there isn't any work," he said. "For a while, we
were paying people to quit, but a company that's losing money can't afford to
do that.";    The sell-offs and downsizing have not been enough, however. SP
had reduced its debt by only <MONEY>$300 million</MONEY> last <DATE>summer</DATE>. Pera declined last week
to update that figure.;    <LOCATION>Southern Pacific</LOCATION> was the only major <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> railroad
to report losses to the <ORGANIZATION>Interstate Commerce Commission</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1989</DATE> and <DATE>1990</DATE>. The
San Francisco-based company lost <MONEY>$34 million</MONEY> in net income in <DATE>1989</DATE> -- it's
worst year since the Great Depression -- and <MONEY>$13 million</MONEY> last year.;    Union
officials in <LOCATION>Sacramento</LOCATION> said <DATE>last week</DATE> that SP officials told them the company
has lost <MONEY>$45 million</MONEY> since <DATE>Jan. 1.</DATE>;    <PERSON>Pera</PERSON> said the company's financial
troubles also stem partly from tough competition in the transportation
industry and changing needs among shippers.;    "Some commodities lend
themselves more to being shipped by (railroad) cars, like coal and grain," he
said. "We don't have tracks in those areas.";    About <PERCENT>30 percent</PERCENT> of SP's
cargo is seagoing containers and flatbed trucks and trailers already loaded
with goods. The railroad has to compete for many of those shipments with the
trucking industry, which is mostly non-union and may ship goods directly and
to remote areas for much less money.;    "A lot of companies today order in
smaller shipments, one at a time," <PERSON>Pera</PERSON> said. "It's just enough to fit in a
truck.";    Founded in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Southern Pacific</LOCATION> has 20,000 miles of tracks
in 16 states in the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Midwest</LOCATION>. Its previous owner, <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Southern
Pacific Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, is a <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> holding company. Federal regulators forced it to
sell SP in <DATE>1987.</DATE>;    With <PERSON>Anschutz</PERSON> based in <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION>, speculation abounds that
the railroad that opened the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION> to a fledgling nation eventually may leave
its birthplace.  </TEXT>

   CHICAGO -- Santa Fe Pacific Corp. said Michael R. Haverty
resigned as president and chief operating officer of the
holding company's flagship Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe
Railway unit.
   Mr. Haverty, 46 years old, will be succeeded by Robert D.
Krebs, Santa Fe Pacific's chairman and chief executive
officer.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In a news release, <PERSON>Mr. Haverty</PERSON> said the parent company's
recent spinoff of its energy and real estate operations, and
the combination of the railway and holding company
organizations have created "an increasing amount of overlap"
in the responsibilities of the railway head and <PERSON>Mr. Krebs</PERSON>. He
said he had, as a consequence, "decided to seize the moment
to pursue new challenges."
   Since assuming the company's top railroad job in <DATE>1989</DATE>, <PERSON>Mr.
Haverty</PERSON> had drawn positive reviews from industry analysts.
Among the accomplishments they cite are his negotiation of
agreements with rail unions, which cut the size of train
crews.
   He also launched innovative intermodal services, such as a
joint venture with <ORGANIZATION>J.B. Hunt Transport Services Inc</ORGANIZATION>. Under
that program, Hunt trucks pick up and deliver freight for
shippers, but transfer it to high-speed <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> trains
between the <LOCATION>Midwest</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>West Coast</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Mr. Haverty</PERSON> also helped to rebuild the railroad's image
after its aborted merger with <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific Transportation
Co</ORGANIZATION>.
   But with the parent company's recent spin-off of much of
its non-railroad holdings, it "appears that there is a lot
less for <PERSON>Michael Haverty</PERSON> to do now that <PERSON>Robert Krebs</PERSON> is able
to devote more of his time to the railroad," said <ORGANIZATION>PaineWebber
Inc.</ORGANIZATION> analyst <PERSON>Anthony Hatch</PERSON>.
   In an interview, <PERSON>Mr. Haverty</PERSON> acknowledged "overlapping
responsibilities" as one reason he decided to leave the
company and "look for some new opportunities" in the
transportation industry, though not necessarily in
railroading.

There's no indication of how close to establishing the credit La Jolla, Calif.-based <ORGANIZATION>Henley</ORGANIZATION> might be. 
As previously reported, <ORGANIZATION>Henley</ORGANIZATION> has offered <MONEY>$63</MONEY> a share in cash and securities, or about <MONEY>$9.94 billion</MONEY>, for the transportation, energy and real estate concern. 

   Officials at <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Southern</ORGANIZATION> declined to identify the suitors for <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION>. 
But people familiar with the bids said they include offers from <ORGANIZATION>Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western Railroad</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>Denver-based Anschutz Corp.</ORGANIZATION>; a <LOCATION>Southern Pacific</LOCATION> management group; <LOCATION>North Billerica</LOCATION>, Mass.-based <ORGANIZATION>Guilford Transportation Industries Inc.</ORGANIZATION>; and the <ORGANIZATION>Railway Labor Executives Association</ORGANIZATION>, which represents <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> employees. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Kansas City Southern Industries Inc.</ORGANIZATION> said late yesterday that it is also among the five bidders. 

   The company declined to identify which of the suitors had raised their offers. 
However, sources close to the bidding process said the management group and the <ORGANIZATION>Railway Labor</ORGANIZATION> union had increased their offers. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> had set yesterday as the deadline for accepting firm bids for the railroad. 

   The labor union said previously that it offered <MONEY>$750 million</MONEY> for the railroad. 
Sources said the management group's original bid offered similar terms. 

   A spokesman for <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> confirmed late yesterday that the management group filed a revised bid, but declined to specify the changes. 
Railway union officials weren't immediately available. 

   Officials at <ORGANIZATION>Kansas City Southern</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Denver Rio Grande</ORGANIZATION> declined to comment on the terms of their latest bids. 

   Santa Fe initially received two other bids, including one from <LOCATION>Henley</LOCATION>, which has since made its offer for the whole company. 
Sources said Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION>Itel Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, another of the original bidders, dropped out after completing examining <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION>'s financial records. 
An <ORGANIZATION>Itel</ORGANIZATION> official declined to comment. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Southern</ORGANIZATION> shares closed yesterday at <MONEY>$51.75</MONEY>, up <MONEY>$1.875</MONEY>, in <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> decided to sell <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> <DATE>earlier this year</DATE> after the <ORGANIZATION>Interstate Commerce Commission</ORGANIZATION> rejected its plan to merge that railroad with its <ORGANIZATION>Atchison Topeka &amp; Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> unit. 
The <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION> ruled that such a combination was anti-competitive and ordered <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> to shed one of its railroads. 

   In recent weeks, the fate of <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> has been dwarfed by the uncertainty surrounding its parent company. 
After <ORGANIZATION>Henley Group</ORGANIZATION> announced its offer for <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Olympia &amp; York Developments Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, a Toronto-based real estate concern, said it may match "or better" <PERSON>Henley</PERSON>'s offer. 

   The banks involved in the <LOCATION>Henley</LOCATION> financing include New York-based <ORGANIZATION>Citicorp</ORGANIZATION>; officials couldn't be reached for comment late yesterday. 
The names of other banks couldn't be definitively learned. 

   A spokesman for <ORGANIZATION>Henley</ORGANIZATION>, a manufacturing, engineering and financial services concern, declined comment on the possibility of such a credit line, which would be among the largest ever established. 

   As previously reported, <PERSON>Henley</PERSON> has accumulated a <PERCENT>14.1%</PERCENT> stake in Chicago-based <LOCATION>Santa Fe</LOCATION>. 

   A <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> spokesman said discussions are continuing with both <ORGANIZATION>Henley and Olympia &amp; York</ORGANIZATION>.

   An association representing the unionized employees of <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp.</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> railroad said it offered <MONEY>$750 million</MONEY> for the unit. 

   The <ORGANIZATION>Railway Labor Executives' Association</ORGANIZATION> said its bid was submitted together with a "parallel" offer from the management of the <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> unit. 
The two groups said they are working toward making a joint offer for the railroad. 

   Separately, Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>third-quarter</DATE> net income soared nearly tenfold to <MONEY>$123.5 million</MONEY>, or <MONEY>78 cents</MONEY> a share, reflecting a huge charge taken in the <DATE>1986 quarter</DATE> and improved results for rail and oil operations. 

   In <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading yesterday, <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> closed down <MONEY>$4.75</MONEY>, at <MONEY>$56.25</MONEY> a share. 

   Yesterday had been set by <LOCATION>Santa Fe</LOCATION> as the deadline for bids for its <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> unit, which the company put on the block after its proposal to merge its two large railroad units was rejected by the <ORGANIZATION>Interstate Commerce Commission</ORGANIZATION>. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Kansas City Southern Industries Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION>Kansas City</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mo.</LOCATION>, also submitted a bid for the railroad in conjunction with <ORGANIZATION>Warburg E.M. Pincus &amp; Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Landon H. Rowland</PERSON>, president and chief executive officer said. 
<PERSON>Mr. Rowland</PERSON> wouldn't give details of the offer but said the company's investment banker is <ORGANIZATION>Lazard Freres &amp; Co</ORGANIZATION>. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western Railroad Co.</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>Rio Grande Industries</ORGANIZATION>, is also among the list of bidders, said <PERSON>William J. Holtman</PERSON>, president. 
<ORGANIZATION>Rio Grande</ORGANIZATION> is a unit of <ORGANIZATION>Anschutz Corp</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>Mr. Holtman</PERSON> wouldn't elaborate on the company's offer. 

   In addition to the <MONEY>$750 million</MONEY> in cash, the Washington-based union group said its bid includes the assumption of <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION>'s long-term debt and other liabilities, unspecified cost savings, and the spinning back to <LOCATION>Santa Fe</LOCATION> of certain tax credits attached to the unit. 
The union group said the "full economic value" of its offer is <MONEY>$3.6 billion</MONEY>. 

   It added that <ORGANIZATION>Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.</ORGANIZATION> would provide financing for its offer. 
In <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, where the railroad is based, a <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> spokesman said the unit's long-term debt exceeds <MONEY>$800 million</MONEY>. 

   The management group wouldn't disclose details of its bid, but a spokesman said it is "similar" to the union group's bid and is based on retention of the railroad's core rail system. 
The group's investment banker is <ORGANIZATION>Hellman &amp; Friedman</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, the spokesman said. 

   A <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> spokesman said the company has received several bids for its <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> unit, but he wouldn't elaborate. 

   For the <DATE>1986 third quarter</DATE>, the holding company reported net income of <MONEY>$12.4 million</MONEY>, or <MONEY>eight cents</MONEY> a share. 
That included an after-tax charge of <MONEY>$70.5 million</MONEY> associated with the write-down of oil and gas properties. 

   Revenue for the <DATE>1987 third quarter</DATE> rose <PERCENT>7.5%</PERCENT> to <MONEY>$1.41 billion</MONEY> from <MONEY>$1.31 billion</MONEY> a year earlier. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> said pretax operating profit in its transportation group rose <PERCENT>43%</PERCENT>, largely because of increased shipments of grain and piggybacked trailers and containers. 
Meanwhile, sharply higher oil prices and higher daily oil production pushed petroleum operations into the black; those operations bled badly last year. 

   For the nine months, <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> reported that net income more than doubled to <MONEY>$259.8 million</MONEY>, or <MONEY>$1.64</MONEY> a share, as revenue rose <PERCENT>1.8%</PERCENT> to <MONEY>$4.01 billion</MONEY>. 
A year earlier, the company earned <MONEY>$123.9 million</MONEY>, or <MONEY>74 cents</MONEY> a share, on revenue of <MONEY>$3.94 billion</MONEY>.

<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>Koll Co.</ORGANIZATION> and a Japanese partner have bought nearly 300 acres in <LOCATION>Riverside 
County</LOCATION> from <ORGANIZATION>Union Pacific Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, and the <LOCATION>Orange County</LOCATION> developer said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> 
it is negotiating to buy still more property from the railroad holding company. 
</P>
<P>
Koll and <ORGANIZATION>Ohbayashi America Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, whose parent is one of the largest 
contractors in the world, paid <MONEY>$32 million</MONEY> for 297 acres in the unincorporated 
<LOCATION>Mira Loma</LOCATION> area at the northwestern tip of <LOCATION>Riverside County</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The partners plan to turn the property into a business park. 
</P>
<P>
The deal comes several months after <PERSON>Koll</PERSON>'s proposed <MONEY>$532-million</MONEY> purchase of 
most of <ORGANIZATION>Union Pacific</ORGANIZATION>'s land and buildings fell through. It would have been 
<PERSON>Koll</PERSON>'s biggest acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Union Pacific</ORGANIZATION>, which operates the railroad of the same name, said the previous 
deal fell through because <PERSON>Koll</PERSON> and an unnamed partner couldn't prove they could 
come up with the money. Koll, however, said its financing was solid. 
</P>
<P>
In any event, since then Koll officials have continued to negotiate with <ORGANIZATION>Union 
Pacific</ORGANIZATION> for smaller pieces of property, including the <LOCATION>Riverside County</LOCATION> parcel. 
</P>
<P>
The transaction is <ORGANIZATION>Ohbayashi</ORGANIZATION>'s second joint venture with <PERSON>Koll</PERSON>. The two 
companies are also building a <MONEY>$200-million</MONEY>, 28-story office tower in downtown 
<LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION>Ohbayashi</ORGANIZATION> has been in the development business in <LOCATION>Southern 
California</LOCATION> since the early <DATE>1980s</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
The partners said the <LOCATION>Riverside County</LOCATION> property will be used to construct 
buildings for lease or sale to businesses. They will also sell land to 
companies that want to construct their own buildings. The first parcels are 
expected to go on sale by the middle of next year. 
</P>
<P>
The huge <ORGANIZATION>Union Pacific</ORGANIZATION> deal that fell through included land and buildings in 19 
states. The <LOCATION>Riverside County</LOCATION> parcel was part of that transaction. 
</P>
<P>
One big <LOCATION>West Coast</LOCATION> developer who considered making an offer for the railroad 
property said recently that he considered it overpriced at half <MONEY>a billion 
dollars</MONEY>. Not so, said <PERSON>Chuck Schreiber</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Koll Co.</ORGANIZATION> executive vice president in 
charge of acquiring property for the developer. 
</P>
<P>
"People who say that obviously didn't study the property very closely," he 
said. "We spent a lot of time looking at it, and we were very happy with the 
price." 
</P>
<P>
The deal included railroad property as far east as the <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> suburbs and 
would have given Koll -- which calls itself the <LOCATION>West Coast</LOCATION>'s largest property 
owner -- a toehold in the <LOCATION>East</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
When the deal was announced in <DATE>January</DATE>, <PERSON>Koll</PERSON> was a little vague about whether 
it would develop the <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> property. Now the company isn't saying whether 
it is still negotiating to buy any of the <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> properties or whether it will 
stick to buying some of the railroad's numerous <LOCATION>West Coast</LOCATION> holdings. 
</P>
<P>
The railroad is selling its real estate because the development business hasn't 
been profitable enough to boost publicly held <ORGANIZATION>Union Pacific</ORGANIZATION>'s stock price much. 
The railroad wanted to concentrate on its other, more profitable businesses.

   <ORGANIZATION>Kansas City Southern Industries Inc.</ORGANIZATION> would sell off a major section of the <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> railroad, for which it is readying a bid, to <ORGANIZATION>Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western Railroad Co.</ORGANIZATION>, a person familiar with <ORGANIZATION>Kansas City Southern</ORGANIZATION>'s strategy said. 

   The <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> section in question, between <LOCATION>Ogden</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, is one of three main <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> lines, and has long been coveted by closely held <ORGANIZATION>Denver &amp; Rio Grande</ORGANIZATION>. 
The section, which analysts suggested would have a value of roughly <MONEY>$130 million</MONEY>, would give the Denver-based concern much-needed access to <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> markets. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Kansas City Southern</ORGANIZATION>'s designs on <LOCATION>Southern Pacific</LOCATION>, which is owned by <ORGANIZATION>Chicago-based Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, were first disclosed in <DATE>January</DATE>. 
If the plans lead to any acquisition, they might have the additional benefit of discouraging an unwanted suitor for <ORGANIZATION>Kansas City Southern</ORGANIZATION>. 

   A spokesman for <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> said the company will consider any offers made for the <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> railroad. 
He said <ORGANIZATION>Kansas City Southern</ORGANIZATION> hasn't bid for the railroad. 
<LOCATION>Kansas City Southern</LOCATION> said it is still waiting for additional financial data on the railroad before setting a purchase price. 

   A group led by <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> investor <PERSON>Howard Kaskel</PERSON> disclosed <DATE>earlier this month</DATE> that it has acquired a <PERCENT>7.9%</PERCENT> stake in the <LOCATION>Kansas City</LOCATION>, Mo.-based railroad and data-processing concern. 
The group also has asked the government for clearance to seek control. 

   The <PERSON>Kaskel</PERSON> group has said it opposes <ORGANIZATION>Kansas City Southern</ORGANIZATION>'s plans to bid for <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> and, in conversations between the two sides' Wall Street representatives, has said it believes <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> would be a drag on <ORGANIZATION>Kansas City Southern</ORGANIZATION>'s earnings. 

   <PERSON>Samuel Freeman</PERSON>, a lawyer representing <ORGANIZATION>Denver &amp; Rio Grande</ORGANIZATION>, confirmed that his company is interested in acquiring the <LOCATION>Southern Pacific</LOCATION> section, as well as another route from <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Portland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ore.</LOCATION>, from either <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION>Kansas City Southern</ORGANIZATION>. 

   A <ORGANIZATION>Kansas City Southern</ORGANIZATION> spokesman said the company would be interested in selling pieces of <LOCATION>Southern Pacific</LOCATION>, but he didn't specify which ones. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION>, formed in <DATE>1983</DATE> through the merger of the parent companies of the <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> railroads, has been ordered by the <ORGANIZATION>Interstate Commerce Commission</ORGANIZATION> to sell one of the railroad units. 
It is widely believed that the Chicago-based company will attempt to shed <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION>, which, if sold, could fetch a price of more than <MONEY>$1 billion</MONEY>, railroad analysts have suggested. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> is considering a number of alternatives, including a sale or spinoff of all or part of the <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> unit, and is expected to file a divestiture plan with the <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION> by <DATE>Sept. 28</DATE>. 
In addition, both the unit's management and its employees are considering leveraged buyout offers. 

   <LOCATION>Kansas City Southern</LOCATION>, however, is the only concern that has so far publicly expressed an interest in <LOCATION>Southern Pacific</LOCATION>. 

   In a leveraged buy-out, a small group of investors acquires a company largely with debt that ultimately is paid with funds generated by the acquired company.

   <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp.</ORGANIZATION> said it reached another agreement with a railroad company in an effort to win support for the proposed merger of its two railway units -- the <LOCATION>Santa Fe</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION>. 

   The latest agreement is with <ORGANIZATION>Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad Co.</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>Katy Industries Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Elgin</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ill</LOCATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> said Missouri-Kansas-Texas will be given trackage rights over certain lines in <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>. 
In exchange, Missouri-Kansas-Texas said it will support the proposed merger, assuming the trackage-rights agreement is approved by the federal government. 

   As reported, the <ORGANIZATION>Interstate Commerce Commission</ORGANIZATION> stunned the railroad industry last <DATE>July</DATE> by rejecting a plan to merge <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION>. 
The agency cited anti-competitive problems with the merger. 
The two railway units have operated separately since their parents, <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Industries Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, combined in <DATE>1983</DATE> to form <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION>. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> recently appealed the <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION> ruling. 
To drum up support for the appeal, the company agreed to give <ORGANIZATION>Union Pacific Corp.</ORGANIZATION> the right to operate on some of the units' lines and reached a similar agreement with <ORGANIZATION>Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western Railroad</ORGANIZATION>.

   <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp.</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>Friday</DATE> that it wants to sell its ailing <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> railroad unit to comply with a federal divestiture order that it dispose of one of its two rail systems. 

   As expected, the diversified holding company said in a filing with the <ORGANIZATION>Interstate Commerce Commission</ORGANIZATION> that it wants to keep its more profitable <ORGANIZATION>Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway</ORGANIZATION> unit, based here. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> said it is studying whether to sell <LOCATION>San Francisco-based Southern Pacific</LOCATION> as a whole or piecemeal, or whether to spin off the unit to shareholders. 

   As previously reported, the holding company already has held talks about a sale of the unit with <LOCATION>Kansas City</LOCATION>, Mo.-based <ORGANIZATION>Kansas City Southern Industries Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and closely held <ORGANIZATION>Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western Railroad Co</ORGANIZATION>. Groups representing <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> management and its unions also have shown interest in acquiring the unit. 

   An <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION> spokesman said the agency would have to approve the sale of <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> operations to other railroads. 
In <DATE>June</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION> ordered the railroad divestiture because of anti-competitive concerns.

<TEXT>
   Companies that gripe about how long it takes to complete a merger should consider the plight of <PERSON>John J. Schmidt</PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp</ORGANIZATION>. 
He's been trying to conclude the same transaction for four years. 

   His struggle is to merge the <ORGANIZATION>Atchison Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway</ORGANIZATION> with the <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> railroad, a move that would create the second-largest <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> railroad. 
The transaction has been in limbo since <DATE>1983</DATE>, pending antitrust clearance from the <ORGANIZATION>Interstate Commerce Commission</ORGANIZATION>. 

   Last <DATE>summer</DATE>, a strategical blunder by <PERSON>Mr. Schmidt</PERSON> nearly killed the merger. 
Afraid the <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION> might require concessions to <LOCATION>Santa</LOCATION> Fe competitors, the executive insisted that the commission either approve the proposal intact or reject it. 
The <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION> went along with those terms, and in a decision that stunned the industry, rejected the plan. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Schmidt</PERSON> has since regrouped with <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> attorneys and asked the <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION> to rehear the case -- this time with concessions already built in. 
He also has put together a huge list of endorsers of the merger, including customers, other railroads and city and state governments. 

   Although the commission has agreed to rethink its position and a decision is expected during the next four months, some industry observers have begun to question whether <PERSON>Mr. Schmidt</PERSON>'s dogged persistence makes sense -- especially given the <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION>'s historic reluctance to reverse itself. 

   "There are two schools of thought about what he's doing," says <PERSON>Jeffrey Stone</PERSON>, a railroad analyst with <ORGANIZATION>Wertheim &amp; Co.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. 
"There are those who think he's being very pragmatic and practical and doing something right for the company, but very difficult. 
There's another school of thought that says he's a <PERSON>Don Quixote</PERSON>." 

   <PERSON>Mr. Schmidt</PERSON> was so confident of <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION> approval that on the day the agency met, he scheduled a lunch meeting with analysts to discuss the presumed victory. 
<ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> officials had to cancel the session hastily. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION>'s board still supports the merger, though not without some doubts, says director <PERSON>Robert H. West</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Butler Manufacturing Inc.</ORGANIZATION> "We've given away more than we would like to (in concessions to other railroads). 
Whether it's too much will be measured retrospectively," <PERSON>Mr. West</PERSON> said. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Schmidt</PERSON> insists the concessions the company has made as part of its latest proposal actually may result in a better transaction. 
He says the plan would cut costs at the combined railroad by <MONEY>$300 million</MONEY> annually, slightly more than originally forecast. 

   The concessions mainly involve settlements with other railroads that opposed the merger. 
They allow the other carriers to use certain stretches of <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> track, in return for reciprocal arrangements or other considerations. 
In return, the competitors have agreed to support the merger. 

   "I think <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> has done as well as it could under the circumstances and probably better than most anyone could have expected," said <PERSON>Samuel Freeman</PERSON>, vice president and general counsel of <ORGANIZATION>Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western Railroad</ORGANIZATION>. 

   Unlike his predecessor <PERSON>John Reed</PERSON>, a railroad buff who moved up the ranks from track maintenance supervisor to chairman, <PERSON>Mr. Schmidt</PERSON>, 59 years old, started out as a company lawyer and has been more active in legal associations than railroad groups. 

   Those who have worked with him say he exhibits a lawyer's attention to detail, sometimes pointing out even the slightest discrepancies in a report. 
In staff discussions, he also often brings up his responsibility to shareholders. 

   With the same dogged determination he has shown in the merger battle, he took up long-distance running 20 years ago, when he was "fat, sloppy and couldn't even run two blocks" and two friends his age had already died of heart attacks, he says. 
He eats carrots, apples and oranges for lunch and runs 15 miles a week, often along the lake front here. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> has earned money during most of his five-year tenure, but posted a net loss of <MONEY>$137.9 million</MONEY> for <DATE>1986</DATE>, compared with net income of <MONEY>$469.6 million</MONEY> a year earlier. 
<PERSON>Mr. Schmidt</PERSON> blamed the deficit mainly on the collapse of oil prices that affected <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION>'s petroleum operations. 

   The <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> railroad posted an operating loss of <MONEY>$142 million</MONEY> for <DATE>1986</DATE>; <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> had an operating loss of <MONEY>$586.9 million</MONEY>. 
Company officials say the losses were high because of certain restructuring costs and special charges. 

   If the <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION> again rejects the merger, <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> will be forced to sell at least one of its railroads. 
While the <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> is already owned by the company, it has been held in a separate trust and operated independently since <DATE>1983</DATE> pending a final <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION> decision. 

   Investment advisers who work for <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> shareholders said they believe that a negative decision would benefit the company's stockholders, because the company would realize a short-term infusion of funds from the sale of one of its carriers. 
The advisers maintain, however, that the <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> would gain more long-term benefits if the merger were approved. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Schmidt</PERSON> won't say what he will do if the <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION> again rejects the case. 
Harking back to his childhood in a tough neighborhood in downtown <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>, he says: "I'm used to winning, and I'm used to losing. 
When I lose, I get up and keep trying."

<TEXT>
   A federal court has canceled a scheduled
<DATE>Friday</DATE> hearing on <ORGANIZATION>Kansas City Southern Industries</ORGANIZATION>' application for
a stay of a recent court order barring its efforts to purchase the
<ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific Railroad</ORGANIZATION>.
   KCSI president and chief executive <PERSON>Landon Rowland</PERSON> said he asked
the court to cancel the hearing on the advice of company attorneys,
who said it was ``procedurally not ripe'' to have the hearing now.
   He said the cancellation had nothing to do with <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>'s
<ORGANIZATION>Interstate Commerce Commission</ORGANIZATION> approval of <ORGANIZATION>Rio Grande Industries
Inc.</ORGANIZATION>'s proposal to buy <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION> in a series of votes <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> rejected the <LOCATION>Kansas City
Southern</LOCATION> proposal, partly due to concern over <LOCATION>Kansas City
Southern</LOCATION>'s financial outlook in light of a <MONEY>$600 million</MONEY> court
judgment against the company.
   In <DATE>April</DATE>, a <ORGANIZATION>U.S. District Court</ORGANIZATION> jury in <LOCATION>South Dakota</LOCATION> returned a
verdict that <ORGANIZATION>Kansas City Southern</ORGANIZATION> had violated antitrust laws by
helping block a coal slurry pipeline that would have taken some of
the railroad's business, and awarded the judgment to the state of
<LOCATION>South Dakota</LOCATION>.
   The verdict is being appealed to the <ORGANIZATION>8th Circuit Court of
Appeals</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>St. Paul</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Minn</LOCATION>.
   A federal judge in <LOCATION>Sioux Falls</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>S.D.</LOCATION>, recently ruled that <ORGANIZATION>KCSI</ORGANIZATION>
could not buy <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific Railroad</ORGANIZATION> while it is appealing the
judgment.
   ``We think its moot in view of the fact that the order has not
been entered in <LOCATION>South Dakota</LOCATION>,'' <PERSON>Rowland</PERSON> said of <DATE>Friday</DATE>'s court
hearing.
   Southern Pacific, part of <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, has
15,000 miles of track and is one of the oldest rail lines in the
nation, with track stretching from <LOCATION>Oregon</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Sante Fe Southern</ORGANIZATION> reached agreement with <ORGANIZATION>Rio Grande Industries</ORGANIZATION>
on the sale last <DATE>February</DATE>, but when permission for the transaction
was sought from the <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Kansas City Southern</ORGANIZATION> objected and asked
that it be allowed to buy the railroad.
   Roland said the company's offer to buy <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> ``is
still on the table,'' and said the company would review all its
options when the full commission decision is released.

   The growth of Southeast Asian manufacturing is putting its
stamp on container shipping, spawning new services to ferry
the region's goods through the Suez Canal to the U.S. East
Coast.
   These "pendulum services" -- shuttling back and forth
between the two regions -- reduce delivery times by making
fewer stops en route than the more-established
around-the-world operations covering the same territory. They
also offer another alternative to Pacific land-bridge
services, which ship Asian cargo to the U.S. West Coast and
load it onto trains bound for the Midwest and East Coast.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   One new service in particular -- the <ORGANIZATION>Asia-East Coast
Express</ORGANIZATION>, operated by Singapore-based <ORGANIZATION>Neptune Orient Lines
Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> (NOL) in partnership with <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Nippon Yusen Kaisha</ORGANIZATION> --
is being watched by both the shipping industry, which has
been hurt by recession and overcapacity in recent years, and
by <ORGANIZATION>East Coast</ORGANIZATION> ports, which are eager to grab more of the
lucrative Asian market dominated by <ORGANIZATION>West Coast</ORGANIZATION> rivals.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Suez</ORGANIZATION> route doesn't pose any near-term threat to the
<LOCATION>Pacific Rim</LOCATION> shipping business, according to businessmen and
analysts. But it gives some <LOCATION>East Coast</LOCATION> ports a needed boost
and points to the increasing importance of <LOCATION>Southeast Asia</LOCATION> as
a manufacturing center.
   "The Asian manufacturing base moving south is changing
the game, the whole playing field" in the cargo industry,
says <PERSON>Arnold Davis</PERSON>, spokesman for the Port Authority of <LOCATION>New
York</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION>. Ports such as <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Norfolk</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Va.</LOCATION>,
and <LOCATION>Charleston</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>S.C.</LOCATION>, "are certainly a beneficiary of this
new development, and we're excited about it."
   Lower labor costs have attracted many international
companies to <LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Indonesia</LOCATION> and parts of <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>
and <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>. The region has taken over production of many
lower-value-added goods from <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION>.
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> retailers' demand for these goods, especially in the
volatile apparel and toy industries, has given rise to calls
for speedier transport from the region to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, says
<PERSON>Patrick Mongno</PERSON>, senior vice president of <ORGANIZATION>Tricom Shipping
Agencies Inc.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, the general agents for <ORGANIZATION>NOL</ORGANIZATION>.
   Much of <LOCATION>Southeast Asia</LOCATION>'s cargo feeds into <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION>, which
in <DATE>1990</DATE> surpassed <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> as the world's busiest container
port. Because <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION>, via the <ORGANIZATION>Suez</ORGANIZATION>, is closer to the <ORGANIZATION>U.S.
East Coast</ORGANIZATION> and doesn't require a rail link to get to the
seaboard's major markets, it makes sense for shipments to
that area, says <PERSON>Mr. Davis</PERSON>. In an increasingly competitive
industry, the carriers "want to use their main asset, the
ship, as much as possible and minimize rail and trucking
trips," he says, adding that "the <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION> route is a
natural progression of this trend."
   NOL's express service, the only nonstop service between
<LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, starts <DATE>Dec. 7</DATE> and departs from
<LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION> every 10 days. The company says it will take 22
days for cargo to reach <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. That betters by two weeks
<ORGANIZATION>NOL</ORGANIZATION>'s all-water <LOCATION>East Coast</LOCATION> service through the <LOCATION>Panama Canal</LOCATION>,
which ends this month, and equals the best landbridge service
between <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> via the <LOCATION>West Coast</LOCATION>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>NOL</ORGANIZATION> express ships also will stop in <LOCATION>Norfolk</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Charleston</LOCATION>, and will call in <LOCATION>Halifax</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Nova Scotia</LOCATION>, before
heading back across the <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION>. The service
then stops in <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION> again, before
returning for <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>.
   NOL is operating the venture with backing from another
major Asian shipping company, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s NYK Line. NYK will
supply four of the six ships to be used on the route, and
will itself charter about <PERCENT>14%</PERCENT> of the service's capacity.
   Earlier this year, <ORGANIZATION>Dubai-based United Arab Shipping Co.</ORGANIZATION>
started a smaller-capacity, 32-day service between <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION>
and the <LOCATION>U.S. East Coast</LOCATION>, with stops in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Norfolk</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Savannah</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ga.</LOCATION>, as well as <ORGANIZATION>Middle Eastern</ORGANIZATION> and
<LOCATION>Mediterranean</LOCATION> ports.
   The companies are "targeting a niche market, for
time-sensitive items that need to move from manufacturers to
retailers quickly," says <PERSON>Nai Boon Hiong</PERSON>, who tracks <ORGANIZATION>NOL</ORGANIZATION> for
<ORGANIZATION>Schroder International Merchant Bankers Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION>.
"The prospects are very good."
   NOL and <ORGANIZATION>NYK</ORGANIZATION> hope to increase the frequency of their
sailings to every seven days by the middle of <DATE>1992</DATE>. They say
the main selling point of their service is speed. Other lines
move cargo on all-water routes from <LOCATION>Southeast Asia</LOCATION> to the
<LOCATION>East Coast</LOCATION>, but generally as part of around-the-world routes,
with many stops.
   In comparison with land-bridge routes, all-water service
doesn't require a transfer of cargo to railroads, and
therefore is more reliable, says <PERSON>Donald McCallian</PERSON>, general
manager and assistant to senior corporate executives for NYK
Line (<ORGANIZATION>North America) Inc.</ORGANIZATION> "One move instead of two is always
good in this business," he says.
   The goods coming in from <LOCATION>Southeast Asia</LOCATION> consist mostly of
"anything you can buy in a department store," says <PERSON>Mr.
Mongno</PERSON>. Toys, apparel, small appliances and some electronics
equipment are expected to fill the service's containers.
   What's going out from the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Mongno</PERSON> says, is
"basically one step above junk" -- scrap paper and plastics,
chemical residues and logs that the Asians recycle or hone
into new products.
   <LOCATION>Southeast Asia</LOCATION> appears well positioned for more growth,
and the shipping companies are trying to prepare for that,
analysts say. NOL, for instance, has expanded its network of
relay services within <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION>, starting a feeder route between
<LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION>, and is making more feeder trips to and
from <LOCATION>Bangkok</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION>, as well as <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>.
   NYK, meanwhile, has reduced its transit time between
<LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> to 18 days, and is maintaining its
around-the-world service to the <LOCATION>East Coast</LOCATION> through the <LOCATION>Panama
Canal</LOCATION>.
   Other major container lines are looking into the
possibility of pendulum services between <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION> and the
<LOCATION>East Coast</LOCATION>, according to <PERSON>Mr. Davis</PERSON>. Most observers agree that
the <ORGANIZATION>Suez</ORGANIZATION> route has potential, but there are obstacles to its
growth.
   Land-bridge services to move Southeast Asian container
cargo from <LOCATION>East Coast</LOCATION> ports as far west as <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> and north
to <LOCATION>Toronto</LOCATION> make geographical sense, says <PERSON>John Covaney</PERSON>, senior
managing director of marketing for the port of <LOCATION>Norfolk</LOCATION>. "You
can have a much lower distribution cost in the East," he
says.
   But <ORGANIZATION>East Coast</ORGANIZATION> ports lag their <LOCATION>West Coast</LOCATION> competitors in
experience with such transport, industry participants say,
and large retailers may resist rerouting their distribution
networks.
   Perhaps more important, several major shippers have
long-term investments in <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> land-bridge services that will
encourage them to continue unloading cargo on the <LOCATION>West Coast</LOCATION>
and transporting it by rail to the <LOCATION>East</LOCATION>, industry observers
say.
   They also point out that as fast as Southeast Asian
countries are growing, their exports to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> aren't
likely to overtake those of the <LOCATION>South Koreans</LOCATION>, Taiwanese and
Japanese any time soon. "Bear in mind that the import market
from <LOCATION>Southeast Asia</LOCATION> is tiny compared to <LOCATION>East Asia</LOCATION>," says
<ORGANIZATION>NYK</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Mr. McCallian</PERSON>.
   Officials at <LOCATION>West Coast</LOCATION> ports, some of which saw years of
double-digit growth in cargo loads because of Asian imports
in the <DATE>1980s</DATE>, don't seem to be worried. <PERSON>Jeff Leong</PERSON>, spokesman
for the Port of <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, points out that the major
container lines, including NYK and <ORGANIZATION>NOL</ORGANIZATION>, are expanding rather
than diminishing their presence in <LOCATION>West Coast</LOCATION> ports, in some
cases building new terminals.
   Still, <ORGANIZATION>Schroder</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Mr. Nai</PERSON> believes the <ORGANIZATION>Suez</ORGANIZATION> route will
prove attractive to shippers. "We see an acceleration of the
region's growth in the next two years," he says. "Perhaps
within a year or two, other companies also will be coming
in."

<LEADPARA>  Southern Pacific Railroad may find it easier to clean up 19,500 gallons of

and was the only major carrier to report a loss.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Athough once the largest private landowner in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION>
has sold <MONEY>$1.2 billion</MONEY> worth of property and track rights since <PERSON>Philip F.
Anschutz</PERSON> bought the company for <MONEY>$1.02 billion</MONEY> in <DATE>1988</DATE>, raising operating cash
and reducing the <MONEY>$1.7 billion</MONEY> debt that faced the <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION> billionaire.;   
Despite recent losses, <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> officials remain optimistic about the
future because their real estate sales have offset operating losses of the
<DATE>last two years</DATE> and because the loss was less last year than in <DATE>1989.</DATE>;    "What
we're convinced of is, if there hadn't been a recession and <LOCATION>Persian Gulf</LOCATION> war
and a spike in fuel costs, '91 would have been a profitable year," said
<ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>Michael Brown</PERSON>. Because of those reasons, though,
the company suffered a "significant" operating loss in the first quarter.;   
Still, the <LOCATION>Sacramento River</LOCATION> spill on <DATE>July 14</DATE> and the subsequent <LOCATION>Ventura County</LOCATION>
derailment near <LOCATION>Seacliff</LOCATION> on <DATE>July 28</DATE> -- when ruptured drums leaked a form of
rocket fuel -- can only exacerbate the company's financial troubles and may be
symptomatic of deeper problems.;    The carrier has had financial troubles for
the <DATE>last 10 years</DATE>, said <PERSON>Joel Price</PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION>Donaldson Lufkin and
Jenrette</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. "With the events of the last two weeks, God only knows
what the effect will be.";    <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> has not given a cost estimate
for the derailment by the <LOCATION>Sacramento River</LOCATION> near <LOCATION>Dunsmuir</LOCATION> because there are
liability questions to settle, <PERSON>Brown</PERSON> said.;    However, the Journal of
<ORGANIZATION>Commerce</ORGANIZATION>, citing environmental agencies, reported an estimate of more than <MONEY>$25
million.</MONEY>;    <PERSON>Brown</PERSON> would not disclose the details of the carrier's insurance
policy, nor how the company would handle the costs.;    Investigators say that
power surges from a faulty electrical generator in a locomotive may have
caused the <LOCATION>Sacramento River</LOCATION> derailment, and that a faulty bearing may have
caused an axle to snap in the <LOCATION>Seacliff</LOCATION> accident.;    Some observers question
whether the company's level of maintenance played a role in the accidents.;   
"I think it (the <LOCATION>Seacliff</LOCATION> derailment) will raise questions, perhaps wrongfully
so, about whether SP's operations and maintenance are up to par," <PERSON>Michael
Lloyd</PERSON>, a rail analyst with <ORGANIZATION>Saloman Brothers</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, told the Journal of
Commerce.;    Sometimes railroad companies cut down on maintenance in poor
economic years, waiting for a profitable year to spend money fixing assets,
said <PERSON>Anthony Hatch</PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION>PaineWebber</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York.</LOCATION>;    "It used to
happen a lot more" in the <DATE>1970s</DATE>, he said. "There should be some drop in a bad
year, because you're not using as many cars, and you don't break down the
tracks as much. But if you're cutting down more, that's a sign of financial
weakness.";    <PERSON>Brown</PERSON> denied that <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> had been lax on maintenance,
pointing out that since <DATE>1988</DATE>, <MONEY>$730 million</MONEY> has gone into capital expenditures,
mostly maintenance and safety-related spending.;    "That is not the action of
a company deferring maintenance," he said.;    But federal reviews of <ORGANIZATION>Southern
Pacific</ORGANIZATION>'s operations indicate a high accident rate and a high percentage of
defects in locomotives.;    In <DATE>June</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Railroad Administration</ORGANIZATION>
inspected <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> locomotives in <LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>, and
found that 206 out of 248 -- or <PERCENT>83 percent</PERCENT> -- had at least one defect.;    And
from <DATE>1986</DATE> to <DATE>1990</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> was virtually tied with <ORGANIZATION>CSX Transportation</ORGANIZATION>
for the highest rate of rail accidents involving hazardous materials, with
1.05 and 1.06 accidents, respectively, per million train miles, according to
the federal agency. In <DATE>1990</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> was easily the highest, at 1.20,
compared to 1.10 for CSX.;    "It would be fair to say if they invested more
in safety, they would have a better safety record," said <PERSON>Robert Creamer</PERSON>,
spokesman for <ORGANIZATION>Citizen Action on Rail Safety.</ORGANIZATION>;    After it deals with the
derailment costs, <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> still has to overcome some business
problems.;    The company's fate depends heavily on shipping automobiles,
lumber and chemicals, all of which are very sensitive to the economy, said
<PERSON>John Hilton</PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION>Argus Research Corp.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York.</LOCATION>;    Lumber,
which accounted for almost <PERCENT>15 percent</PERCENT> of <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION>'s freight revenue in
<DATE>1990</DATE>, fluctuates because its major use is to build houses, and the housing
market is tied to the economy's health. The automobile market, which accounted
for <PERCENT>9.1 percent</PERCENT> of freight revenues, also has been depressed in recent years.;
   Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> ships few "cushion" goods that are
recession-resistant, like coal.;    <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERCENT>7 percent</PERCENT> share of the
overall market is threatened by healthier rail companies.;    "Union Pacific
is really beginning to make big money," Price said. As a result, <ORGANIZATION>Union Pacific</ORGANIZATION>
will probably invest more in capital improvements to lower costs and become an
even tougher foe.;    The <LOCATION>Omaha</LOCATION>, Neb.-based transporter -- one of the three
biggest with 21,000 miles of track -- expanded a major coal line running
through <LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION> and installed a large automobile loading facility in <LOCATION>Los
Angeles.</LOCATION>;    To compete, Price said, "you need resources. If you're running on
a shoestring budget, that's almost conceding defeat.";    <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> is
not helpless, though. In addition to its real estate assets, it does have
valuable routes stretching along the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> coast, from <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> to
<LOCATION>Portland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ore.</LOCATION>, which "all other things being equal," could form a solid core
for a railroad carrier, <PERSON>Hatch</PERSON> said. "You give me that route in perfect shape,

L.A.'S UNION STATION SOLD TO SANTA FE PACIFIC REALTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Historic Union Station has been sold and its owners plan extensive improvements 
for the 51-year-old building and possible future development to reestablish the 
nearly 50-acre site as a regional transportation hub, it was announced <DATE>Monday</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Pacific Realty</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>Monday</DATE> that it bought the <PERCENT>22%</PERCENT> interest in the 
downtown station that <ORGANIZATION>Union Pacific Railroad</ORGANIZATION> has owned since <DATE>1939</DATE>. That's when 
the railroad joined with the <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> railroads to build 
the <ORGANIZATION>Los Angeles Union Passenger Terminal</ORGANIZATION>, as the Spanish-style, art-deco 
flavored depot is formally known. Terms of the deal, which involved an exchange 
of real estate, were not revealed. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Pacific Realty</ORGANIZATION> disclosed that in the last month it bought the <PERCENT>44%</PERCENT> 
stake held by <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> for cash on <DATE>Dec. 31</DATE>. The value of the deal was 
not revealed. The company also said it traded real estate for the <PERCENT>34%</PERCENT> stake 
owned by its sister company and former parent, <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Pacific Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, formerly 
known as <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The convoluted transaction is one of the more minor repercussions of the failed 
merger of the <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> railroads. 
</P>
<P>
After that merger was disallowed by the <ORGANIZATION>Interstate Commerce Commission</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1987</DATE>, 
the <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific Railroad</ORGANIZATION> was sold and Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Pacific</ORGANIZATION> was 
radically restructured. <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific Railroad</ORGANIZATION>'s new owner, <PERSON>Philip Anschutz</PERSON>, 
began selling some non-rail properties, including the <ORGANIZATION>Union Station</ORGANIZATION> interest. 
</P>
<P>
"Our acquisition of this landmark property will enable us to initiate an 
extensive improvement plan and to begin urban planning efforts aimed at 
reestablishing the facility as a regional transportation hub," said <PERSON>Vernon B. 
Schwartz</PERSON>, chief executive of <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Pacific Realty</ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Future development could include offices, stores and restaurants, said <PERSON>Ted 
Tanner</PERSON>, director of development for the property. But any project must await 
completion of construction of a Metro Rail station there, he said, adding that 
the station won't be finished for about two more years. 
</P>

   <ORGANIZATION>Olympia &amp; York Developments Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, which last week said it wouldn't bid for <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, has increased its stake in the giant railroad, energy and real estate concern. 

   In a <ORGANIZATION>Securities and Exchange Commission</ORGANIZATION> filing, <ORGANIZATION>Olympia &amp; York</ORGANIZATION>, a Toronto-based real estate developer controlled by the <PERSON>Reichmann</PERSON> family, said it increased its holding to <PERCENT>8.2%</PERCENT> from <PERCENT>6.9%</PERCENT>. 

   The move ensures that <ORGANIZATION>Olympia &amp; York</ORGANIZATION> is still a force to contend with as <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> tries to steel itself against potential hostile bidders. 
It also steps up pressure on <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION>'s management at a time when it is trying to beat back a takeover threat from La Jolla, Calif.-based <ORGANIZATION>Henley Group Inc</ORGANIZATION>. 

   Henley, a diversified manufacturing concern, holds a <PERCENT>14.7%</PERCENT> stake in <LOCATION>Santa Fe</LOCATION>. 
That holding, combined with <ORGANIZATION>Olympia &amp; York</ORGANIZATION>'s latest purchase, puts nearly a fourth of <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION>'s stock in unfriendly hands. 

   In recent days, <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION>'s management has taken a variety of steps to repel potential hostile suitors. 

   <PERSON>Henley</PERSON> said last week that it might make a tender offer for the <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> shares it doesn't already own after merger talks with <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> broke down. 
As a countermeasure, <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> said it was "willing to consider certain transactions" that would enable the company to regain control of <ORGANIZATION>Henley's Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> stock. 

   People close to <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> said its chairman and chief executive officer, <PERSON>Robert D. Krebs</PERSON>, has been trying to speed up the sale of company assets to raise cash toward that end. 
<PERSON>Mr. Krebs</PERSON> also proposed paying <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> shareholders <MONEY>$4 billion</MONEY> in cash or securities or both, with a twofold purpose in mind: leveraging the company to make it less attractive to potential bidders, and placating other large shareholders in case <LOCATION>Henley</LOCATION> had to be bought off. 

   Last week, <ORGANIZATION>Olympia &amp; York</ORGANIZATION> announced that it had decided against making a <MONEY>$63-a-share</MONEY> offer for Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION>, but said it might still accumulate <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> stock and remained interested in discussing a company restructuring. 
A <MONEY>$63</MONEY> cash offer was the price that the <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> board had said it would consider. 

   If <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> decides to buy back <PERSON>Henley</PERSON>'s stake at a premium, <ORGANIZATION>Olympia &amp; York</ORGANIZATION> may also have to be satisfied. 
At the same time, <ORGANIZATION>Olympia &amp; York</ORGANIZATION> is well-positioned to join forces with <LOCATION>Henley</LOCATION> at some point if it so desires. 

   In its filing, the company said it had acquired an additional 1,917,800 <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> shares between <DATE>Dec. 9</DATE> and <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> at <MONEY>$39.75</MONEY> to <MONEY>$48.064</MONEY> each and now controls 12,837,000 <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> shares. 
<ORGANIZATION>Olympia &amp; York</ORGANIZATION> officials declined to comment further. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> shares closed at <MONEY>$46.875</MONEY>, down <MONEY>$1.875</MONEY>, in active composite trading on the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> yesterday. 

   Whatever happens in the next few months, it is certain <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> will be changed forever. 

   Under <PERSON>Mr. Krebs</PERSON>'s plan, <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> will remain a railroad, natural-resources and real-estate concern, but in a scaled-back form. 
<PERSON>Mr. Krebs</PERSON> has moved already to sell some of <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION>'s smaller businesses, such as its building-contracting unit, its timber company and the <ORGANIZATION>Bankers Leasing &amp; Financial Corp.</ORGANIZATION> subsidiary. 
<ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> said it expects to receive <MONEY>$680 million</MONEY> pretax for these businesses. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> is expected to announce as early as today the sale of its <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific Transportation Co.</ORGANIZATION> unit. 
An official familiar with the bidding process said <LOCATION>Kansas City</LOCATION>, Mo.-based <ORGANIZATION>Kansas City Southern Industries Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Rio Grande Western Railroad</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>Denver-based Anschutz Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, were among the top bidders. 

   The official said that <ORGANIZATION>Kansas City Southern</ORGANIZATION> valued its bid at <MONEY>$1.8 billion</MONEY> and that <ORGANIZATION>Rio Grande</ORGANIZATION> had offered to match that. 

   Both <ORGANIZATION>Henley and Olympia &amp; York</ORGANIZATION> are said to be interested mainly in <LOCATION>Santa Fe</LOCATION>'s vast real estate holdings, valued at an estimated <MONEY>$5 billion</MONEY>. 
Many railroad industry analysts believe <ORGANIZATION>Henley</ORGANIZATION> would proceed to sell the company's assets piecemeal if it succeeds in a takeover. 

   "There are two scenarios I see playing out," said an official close to the company. 
"<ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> will either remain an independent transportation, oil and gas and real estate company, albeit a smaller one, or all of the assets will be liquidated." 

   Even if <ORGANIZATION>Henley</ORGANIZATION> prevails over <LOCATION>Santa Fe</LOCATION> management, its plans may face obstacles at the <ORGANIZATION>Interstate Commerce Commission</ORGANIZATION> -- where jockeying against <ORGANIZATION>Henley</ORGANIZATION> is under way. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> decided to sell the <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> after the <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION> ordered the company to shed one of its two railroad units, citing anti-competitive concerns. 
Henley has told commissioners informally that if it is successful in acquiring <LOCATION>Santa Fe</LOCATION>, it will likely sell the more profitable <ORGANIZATION>Atchison Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway</ORGANIZATION>, and reorganize the <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION>. 

   An <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION> official said commissioners are concerned that <ORGANIZATION>Henley</ORGANIZATION> would sell the <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> in pieces, keeping only its valuable real estate. 
<ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> owns vast tracts of land in <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION>, including spectacular coastline potentially attractive for real-estate development. 

   Such a plan "gave people around here acute heartburn," one commission staffer said. 

   Other bidders for the <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> are reportedly lobbying the commission to use its authority to thwart <LOCATION>Henley</LOCATION>.

<HEAD>ICC OKs Katy-UP Merger</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The purchase by the <ORGANIZATION>Union Pacific Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, of
the ``Katy'' railroad, a regional line that runs from <LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION> to
the <ORGANIZATION>Gulf Coast</ORGANIZATION>, has been approved by the <ORGANIZATION>Interstate Commerce
Commission</ORGANIZATION>, the agency announced today.
   The <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION>'s approval requires the <ORGANIZATION>Union Pacific</ORGANIZATION> and the
<ORGANIZATION>Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad</ORGANIZATION>, as the ``Katy'' is formally known,
to grant trackage rights to other railroads inseveral regions where
direct competition otherwise would be reduced.
   The <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION> approved the merger <DATE>Friday</DATE>, but it was not announced
until today, agency officials said.
   The commission acknowledged that the merger would result in the
elimination of some jobs and abandonment of more than 300 miles of
tracks where the two rail systems run parallel tracks. The
railroads have said about 1,000 jobs would be eliminated.
   The commission concluded, however, that the benefits of the
merger both to the public and to rail shippers outweigh the
negative impact. ``The public benefits will be achieved through
reduced transportation costs ... and improved service for
shippers,'' said <PERSON>Heather Gradison</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION> chairman, in a statement.
   The <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION> said about 300 miles of track has been approved for
abandonment, including a 123-mile stretch from <LOCATION>Henriette</LOCATION> to <PERSON>Durant</PERSON>
in <LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION>. The railroads have said facilities would be shut down
in <LOCATION>St. Louis</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kansas City</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fort Worth</LOCATION> and other points along the
route system because of duplication.
   Ackowledging a concern about reduced competition for <LOCATION>Midwest</LOCATION>
grain shipments, the <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION>Union Pacific</ORGANIZATION> must provide
trackage rights to another railroad between <LOCATION>Omaha</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Kansas City</LOCATION>
to preserve the current level of competition.
   It also required agreements with other rail lines in <LOCATION>south Texas</LOCATION>
where there were competitive concerns about the shipment of crushed
rock from various <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> points to <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION>. An agreement with the
<ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> has alleviated that concern, <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION> officials said.

<HL> ICC Clears Union Pacific's Plan to Buy
Overnite Transportation for $1.2 Billion

   The <ORGANIZATION>Interstate Commerce Commission</ORGANIZATION> unanimously approved <ORGANIZATION>Union Pacific Corp.</ORGANIZATION>'s proposed <MONEY>$1.2 billion</MONEY> acquisition of <ORGANIZATION>Overnite Transportation Co.</ORGANIZATION>, the most recent and ambitious effort by a railroad to enter the trucking business. 

   The decision extends the reach of <LOCATION>New York-based Union Pacific</LOCATION>, whose railroad operations are principally west of the <LOCATION>Mississippi River</LOCATION>, into the eastern half of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, where <LOCATION>Richmond</LOCATION>, Va.-based <ORGANIZATION>Overnite</ORGANIZATION> has concentrated its operations. 
Overnite is the nation's fifth-largest motor carrier of general freight. 

   Union Pacific follows other railroads that have emerged as integrated transportation companies offering a sort of one-stop shopping for shippers. 
In recent years, <ORGANIZATION>CSX Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, a railroad holding concern, has bought the ocean shipping company <ORGANIZATION>SeaLand Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, has launched a truck line and bought a barge company. 
Another railway company, <ORGANIZATION>Norfolk Southern Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, last year bought <ORGANIZATION>North American Van Lines</ORGANIZATION>, a trucking company. 

   The merger was hailed by <ORGANIZATION>Union Pacific</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>William Cook</PERSON>, who said it will "greatly increase our ability to provide our customers with efficient door-to-door service." 
<PERSON>Mr. Cook</PERSON> added that <ORGANIZATION>Union Pacific</ORGANIZATION> expects to create a "wide range of new choices in multi-modal transportation services for shippers throughout the country." 

   Some rail analysts expect <ORGANIZATION>Union Pacific</ORGANIZATION> to offer new transcontinental services by tying <ORGANIZATION>Overnite</ORGANIZATION>'s truck routes in the <LOCATION>East</LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION>Union Pacific</ORGANIZATION>'s trains in the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION>. 

   But other rail experts question whether railroads need to buy truck companies in order to offer such services. 
"The burden of proof is on <LOCATION>Union Pacific</LOCATION> to prove that there are efficiencies accompanying ownership of a truck line that aren't available through cooperative agreements with a truck line," said <PERSON>Jeffrey Stone</PERSON>, a transportation analyst at <ORGANIZATION>Wertheim &amp; Co</ORGANIZATION>. 
"It's hard for me to detect any greater synergies." 

   In composite trading yesterday on the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Union Pacific</ORGANIZATION> closed at <MONEY>$78.625</MONEY>, down <MONEY>37.5 cents</MONEY>. 

   The merger isn't likely to spur additional purchases of truck lines by railroads, however. 
Last year, a federal appeals court instructed the <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION> to apply more-restrictive standards to railroad acquisitions of truck lines, which could chill future mergers of railroads and truck lines. 

   "We tried to give intermodalism a green light, but the court kind of messed it up a little," said one commission staff member. 
Still, he echoed analysts' views that the railroad and trucking companies still could use marketing agreements to offer shippers a wider range of services. 
But he said legislation may be necessary to permit the commission to return to its more lenient standard for approving rail and truck mergers. 
The Union Pacific-Overnite merger was specifically permitted in legislation late last year. 

   Union Pacific agreed to acquire <ORGANIZATION>Overnite</ORGANIZATION> a year ago for <MONEY>$43.25</MONEY> a share. 
The shares have been held by <ORGANIZATION>Union Pacific</ORGANIZATION> in a voting trust pending final <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION> approval. 
In giving the transaction the green light, the commission cited "considerable public benefits, including increased efficiencies and additional service options." 

   The acquisition's only opposition came from the <ORGANIZATION>United Transportation Union</ORGANIZATION>, a Cleveland-based union of 125,000 rail and bus employees. 
"We're fearful that UP may be going into the trucking business rather than concentrating on the railroad business," said <PERSON>Fred Hardin</PERSON>, president of the union. 
He said other big railroad holding companies are trimming their rail holdings by selling off or abandoning thousands of miles of tracks.

Why Rail Merger Was Sidetracked</HL>

   In "The <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> Fears a Rail Regulatory Relapse" (Business World, <DATE>April 7</DATE>), <PERSON>George Melloan</PERSON> argues that a second rejection by the <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION> of a merger between the <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> railroads would be a disturbing reversal of deregulation. 
<PERSON>Mr. Melloan</PERSON> mischaracterizes both the reduction in rail regulation that has occurred since the passage of the Staggers Act of <DATE>1980</DATE> and the <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION>'s competitive analysis of the proposed merger. 

   The Staggers Act did not deregulate the railroads. 
It did free them from a great deal of regulation, where sufficient competition exists, but it also left in place a variety of regulations designed to "balance the needs of carriers, shippers and the public." 
Perhaps the most important remains the <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION>'s responsibility to establish maximum reasonable rail rates for movements not subject to effective competition. 

   This places a heavy burden on the <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION> to protect competition where it exists. 
The <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION> rejected the SF-SP merger because it would have significantly reduced transportation competition and, as a result, would have increased the need to regulate rail rates. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Melloan</PERSON> argues that few if any shippers are truly captive to railroads because many shippers can choose between rail and highway. 
There are, however, a significant number of shippers that cannot economically use trucks. 
<PERSON>Mr. Melloan</PERSON> incorrectly characterizes as "esoteric" the debate before the <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION> over whether trucks are competitive on hauls of more than 1,000 miles. 
Generally, a lessening of railroad competition on these longer hauls cannot be attenuated by competition from trucks. 
The <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION>'s decision to reject the merger was based on a determination, in which the <ORGANIZATION>Justice Department</ORGANIZATION> concurred, that the merger would reduce overall transportation competition, not just rail competition, for a significant amount of traffic. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Melloan</PERSON> also mischaracterizes the role of mergers in reviving the badly rundown rail system that existed at the time the Staggers Act was passed. 
The reductions in costs that have been achieved in the past six years have principally resulted from non-merger provisions in the Staggers Act that allow the abandonment of unprofitable lines, the formation of nonunion short-line railroads, the tailoring of rates and service through contracts, and the rationalization of the rate structure. 
Whether these cost savings can best be realized through mergers is problematic since there has been no railroad merger between close horizontal competitors since well before the passage of the act. 
In general, a large percentage of predicted efficiencies from railroad mergers have failed to materialize. 
More specifically, the efficiency estimates by the <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Southern Pacific</ORGANIZATION> are riddled with errors and misconceptions. 
When a merger reduces competition, its approval requires a careful and accurate showing of efficiencies that could not be achieved without the merger. 
The applicants in this case simply did not provide the necessary showing. 

   Contrary to <PERSON>Mr. Melloan</PERSON>'s assertion, the <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION>'s decision to reject the merger does not represent a slide toward re-regulation. 
Rather, by protecting existing competition, the decision has helped prevent such a slide.
