<HEAD>United Opposition Opens First Presidential Campaign in 19 years</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, CHILE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of people filled a large arena
<DATE>Sunday</DATE> for an enthusiastic opposition rally that opened <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>'s
first presidential election campaign in 19 years.
   Voters in <DATE>December</DATE> will pick a succeessor to military President
<PERSON>Augusto Pinochet</PERSON>, who took power in a bloody military coup in <DATE>1973</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Patricio Aylwin</PERSON>, the candidate put forward by a coalition of 17
opposition parties, spoke to the estimated 10,000 people who crammed
the Caupolican Theatre. About 5,000 more listened to loudspeakers
set up in nearby streets.
   Aylwin stressed the need for a united opposition to restore
democracy in <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>.
   ``My government will not be the government of my own party, the
Christian Democracy, nor the government of the opposition
coalition,'' the 70-year-old law professor and former senator said.
``I want to be the president of all Chileans.''
   The presidential and congressional elections are scheduled for
<DATE>Dec. 14</DATE>. The new government is to take office on <DATE>March 11, 1990</DATE>. It
will be the first presidential election since Chileans chose
<PERSON>Salvador Allende</PERSON>, an avowed Marxist, in <DATE>1970</DATE>.
   Gen. <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON> called the elections after losing an <DATE>October</DATE>
referendum in which voters rejected a proposal to extend his rule
until <DATE>1997</DATE>. Pinochet, has said, however, he intends to remain as
army commander after the election.
   The opposition has united behind <PERSON>Aylwin</PERSON>, and opinion polls show
him leading government candidates by a wide margin.
   Pinochet supporters have become increasingly divided and have
failed to agree on a presidential candidate; two former ministers in
<LOCATION>Pinochet</LOCATION>'s Cabinet are vying for the spot.
   National Renewal, the largest conservative party, nominated
<PERSON>Sergio Jarpa</PERSON>, 68, a former interior minister, while the <ORGANIZATION>Independent
Democratic Union</ORGANIZATION> chose <PERSON>Hernan Buchi</PERSON>, 40, a former finance minister.
   <PERSON>Aylwin</PERSON> said at the rally that if elected, his government's
economic policies would emphasize aid to the nation's poor.
   Although the civilian government in <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION> will inherit an economy
that is one of the strongest in <LOCATION>South America</LOCATION>, wages have dropped by
<PERCENT>35 percent</PERCENT> since <DATE>1981</DATE>. About <PERCENT>38 percent</PERCENT> of the country's 12 million
people live below the poverty line and <PERCENT>22 percent</PERCENT> live in extreme
poverty, according to the <ORGANIZATION>Center for Studies on Development</ORGANIZATION>, a
private resesarch institute.
   <PERSON>Aylwin</PERSON> said he also would seek ``truth and justice,'' not
revenge, for human rights violations under <ORGANIZATION>Pinochet</ORGANIZATION>'s military
regime.
   After seizing power, the military began a harsh repression of
leftists who supported the Allende government. Church and human
rights groups have said at least 750 people disappeared after being
arrested following the coup.
   Aylwin on <DATE>Monday</DATE> was to fly to <LOCATION>Arica</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>northern Chile</LOCATION>, where he
was to begin a campaign tour of the provinces.

<LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION> unearthed the remains of former <ORGANIZATION>Marxist President Salvador Allende</ORGANIZATION> from a 
humble grave <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> and reburied his body in the capital in a solemn ceremony 
17 years after his death in a military coup. 
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of people took to the streets of <LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION> with banners, flags 
and portraits to pay homage to <LOCATION>Allende</LOCATION>, who 20 years ago <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> became the 
first Marxist president freely elected in the Western hemisphere. 
</P>
<P>
His remains were placed in a marble mausoleum at <LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION>'s main cemetery, 
where other Chilean presidents and dignitaries are buried. The military, which 
toppled Allende in the bloody <DATE>1973</DATE> coup, was conspicuously absent from the 
ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
The event was marked by appeals to preserve <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>'s newly restored democratic 
rule. 
</P>
<P>
"We express our will to favor the future of our country, which demands from us 
to unite beyond the disputes that separated us in the past," President <PERSON>Patricio 
Aylwin</PERSON> said in a speech at the cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
Aylwin, an elected civilian who was a political foe of Allende, succeeded Gen. 
<PERSON>Augusto Pinochet</PERSON> last <DATE>March</DATE>, putting an end to 16 1/2 years of authoritarian 
military rule. Pinochet, who led the coup against <ORGANIZATION>Allende</ORGANIZATION>, remains commander in 
chief of the army. 
</P>
<P>
Allende died during an attack on his presidential palace on <DATE>Sept. 11, 1973</DATE>. The 
military said he committed suicide rather than surrender. 
</P>
<P>
Allende's remains were unearthed early in the day from a modest family tomb in 
the city of <ORGANIZATION>Vina del Mar</ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION>, thousands of people lined the streets to 
view the flag-draped coffin. The procession drove past the presidential palace, 
the Catholic cathedral and, finally, the cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
Right-wing politicians said the ceremony was an attempt to gain political 
advantage for the government and the left. But the government said the reburial 
was "repairing an injustice toward a man who was a legitimate president of 
<LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>." 
</P>
<P>
Aylwin was booed when he recalled in his speech that he had opposed the Allende 
government. 
</P>
<P>
Raising his voice, the 71-year-old president replied: "To those who are booing, 
I say: The only language that will allow us to understand each other is the 
language of truth. 
</P>
<P>
"The horror and suffering that <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION> has gone through should never happen 
again," he added. "It's a task for all Chileans to prevent it, and we will be 
able to do so only if we reject hatred and violence." 
</P>
<P>
Allende's widow, <PERSON>Hortensia Bussi</PERSON>, said <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>'s ceremonies "should be seen as 
a contribution to reconciliation." 
</P>
<P>
Security around the ceremonies was tight. Four bombs went off overnight in 
<LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION>, causing minor damage to two military monuments and two shops, but no 
injuries. A right-wing group claimed responsibility.

   The widow of an American whose arrest and
slaying in a <DATE>1973</DATE> military coup inspired the movie ``Missing''
returned to <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION> on <DATE>Saturday</DATE> to witness the end of Gen. <PERSON>Augusto
Pinochet</PERSON>'s 16{-year rule.
   ``It's not the <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION> of my nightmares,'' said <PERSON>Joyce Horman</PERSON>, who
was invited by the elected government that takes power <DATE>Sunday</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Mrs. Horman</PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION>The Associated Press</ORGANIZATION> in an interview that she
no longer expects any new information on her husband's death.
   ``I think it would be a very special circumstance for anyone
with direct knowledge to step forward at this time,'' she said. But
she added: ``I haven't ruled it out.''
   ``But the most important thing is that democracy is established
for Chileans, that there is respect for human rights.''
   Her husband, <PERSON>Charles Horman</PERSON>, then 29, was among thousands of
people arrested when <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON> seized power in a bloody coup on
<DATE>Sept. 11, 1973</DATE>. It toppled the elected government of President
<PERSON>Salvador Allende</PERSON>, a Marxist. Horman, a free-lance journalist, and
his wife were living in <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION> at the time.
   According to the family and testimony collected by human rights
groups, <PERSON>Horman</PERSON> was among many suspected dissidents held and
executed at <LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>National Stadium</ORGANIZATION>. The military government
has denied the allegations.
   Horman's father, <PERSON>Ed Horman</PERSON>, pressed for years for details on his
son's death and wrote a book about his efforts. The book provided
the story for the movie ``Missing,'' starring <PERSON>Sissy Spacek</PERSON> as
<PERSON>Horman</PERSON>'s wife and <PERSON>Jack Lemmon</PERSON> as the father.
   The movie is officially banned in <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>. ``Maybe now they'll
show it,'' <PERSON>Mrs. Horman</PERSON> said.
   In the AP interview, she said she found the country much more
open and friendly than it was when she and her father-in-law were
ushered out by <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> diplomats and military authorities on <DATE>Oct. 18,
1973</DATE>.
   ``The air feels lighter. It's a different place,'' she said.
``It's not the place I remember.''
   Both <PERSON>Mrs. Horman</PERSON>, a 45-year-old computer specialist, and
<PERSON>Horman</PERSON>'s father live in <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION>. Horman's father is not
attending the inauguration.
   On <DATE>Monday</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>National Stadium</ORGANIZATION> will be the site of a massive
celebration to mark the end of <LOCATION>Pinochet</LOCATION>'s rule.
   <PERSON>Patricio Aylwin</PERSON>, a 71-year-old Christian Democrat, was the
candidate of a center-left coalition that defeated <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON> in <DATE>Dec.
14</DATE> national elections, winning <PERCENT>55 percent</PERCENT> of the vote.
   <PERSON>Mrs. Horman</PERSON> was one of about 400 people invited by <PERSON>Aylwin</PERSON> to
witness the change of government.

FINALLY, A DIGNIFIED BURIAL; 
</P>
<P>
AFTER 17 YEARS, ALLENDE TAKES HIS PLACE NEXT TO OTHER CHILEAN PRESIDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Prior to the military coup that ushered in the rigid rule of Gen. <PERSON>Augusto 
Pinochet</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION> was widely admired in <LOCATION>Latin America</LOCATION> for its political 
tolerance. That honorable tradition was revived <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> when Chileans finally 
gave a dignified burial to <PERSON>Salvador Allende</PERSON>, the democratically elected 
president <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON> overthrew in <DATE>1973</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
That was no easy, symbolic gesture for the new government of President <PERSON>Patricio 
Aylwin</PERSON>. For Allende is a controversial figure even in death, and many of the 
men who overthrew him are still alive and still powerful enough to cause 
political problems. Not least among them is Pinochet himself, still the chief 
of <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>'s armed forces and publicly unhappy at the decision to hold a formal 
funeral for the late Marxist president. 
</P>
<P>
Allende died in the final hours of fighting around <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>'s presidential palace 
in <LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION> 17 years ago next week. It is generally believed that he committed 
suicide rather than surrender to <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON>'s forces. He was quietly buried in an 
unmarked grave and his family sent into exile. 
</P>
<P>
Allende's survivors were present when his body was disinterred. They were 
joined by <PERSON>Aylwin</PERSON> and most of his Cabinet for a funeral procession along 
<LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION>'s widest thoroughfare to a funeral mass in the national cathedral and 
burial in the cemetery where other Chilean presidents are buried. Even the date 
chosen for <ORGANIZATION>Allende</ORGANIZATION>'s funeral was a symbol of reconciliation. Allende's family 
did not choose the anniversary of the coup, but instead the date <PERSON>Allende</PERSON> was 
elected president, <DATE>Sept. 4</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
At the funeral, <PERSON>Aylwin</PERSON>, a Christian Democrat, admitted with candor and grace 
that he would still oppose Allende's policies if the circumstances were the 
same today as they were 17 years ago. "But the drama lived by <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION> since <DATE>1973</DATE> 
has taught us that those circumstances should never repeat themselves," he 
added. "It is the duty of all Chileans to avoid them." It was a fitting tribute 
to a man who -- whatever his faults or mistakes -- devoted his life to 
peaceful, democratic politics.

   President <PERSON>Augusto Pinochet</PERSON> announced
<DATE>Thursday</DATE> he has lifted a ban on the return from exile of hundreds
of leftists, including some of his fiercest Marxist critics.
   Within hours of the announcement, a formerly exiled daughter of
Marxist former President <PERSON>Salvador Allende</PERSON>, whose elected government
was ousted by <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON> in a bloody <DATE>1973</DATE> coup, arrived in <LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION>.
   Four hours after <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON>'s announcement, <PERSON>Isabel Allende</PERSON>, 44,
arrived at <LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION>'s international airport on a flight from <PERSON>Buenos
Aires</PERSON>. She had planned the trip days earlier as a challenge to ban
against her return, but <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON>'s announcement allowed for her
re-entry to <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION> without problems.
   Asked why she returned, she told reporters at the airport:
``Because it's my legitimate right.''
   She said her mother, <PERSON>Hortensia Bussi</PERSON>, the exiled widow of
Allende, also plans to return. ``We are going to prepare a grand
entrance, through the front door, as we've always said.''
   Allende's widow <PERSON>Hortensia</PERSON> said in a telephone interview in
<LOCATION>Mexico City</LOCATION> after learning of <LOCATION>Pinochet</LOCATION>'s announcement: ``I am very
happy to be returning to my country. I left in the <DATE>spring</DATE> and I
will return in the <DATE>spring</DATE>.'' Winter is now ending in the <LOCATION>Southern
Hemisphere</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Mrs. Allende</PERSON> and her daughter <PERSON>Carmen</PERSON> have lived in <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> since
the coup.
   It was the first time she had stepped on Chilean soil since she,
her mother and other members of Allende's immediate family took
refuge in the <ORGANIZATION>Mexican Embassy</ORGANIZATION> the day of the coup, departing on a
flight specially arranged by <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>'s president at the time, <PERSON>Luis
Echeverria</PERSON>. Allende died in a siege of the government palace during
the takeover.
   Also <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, the leader of a 16-party opposition coalition
challenged Gen. <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON> to a televised debate during the campaign
for the <DATE>Oct. 5</DATE> referendum in which the president seeks voter
approval for another eight-year term.
   <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON> said in announcing the measure to Chilean reporters:
``The prohibitions are lifted. All of them. I have spoken this
morning with the interior minister and have given instructions with
respect to exile that totally solves this problem.''
   It was the latest of several relaxations in political
restrictions before the ``yes or no'' presidential referendum.
Pinochet's name will be the only one on the ballot.
   Interior Ministry Subsecretary <PERSON>Alberto Cardemil</PERSON> told reporters
the lifting of exile applies to all government opponents previously
banned from returning. He said they were 430 in number.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Roman Catholic Church</ORGANIZATION> human rights agency puts the total
political exiles at 504, but its list includes Chileans who changed
nationality in order to establish foreign residence or obtain work.
   Prominent exiles affected include <PERSON>Luis Corvalan</PERSON>, a former
senator and leader of the outlawed Communist Party who lives in
<LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION>; <PERSON>Carlos Altamirano</PERSON>, a former leader of Allende's Socialist
Party; <ORGANIZATION>Anselmo Sule</ORGANIZATION>, a leading figure in the <ORGANIZATION>International
Socialist Movement</ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON>Volodia Teitelboim</PERSON>, a ranking <ORGANIZATION>Communist
Party</ORGANIZATION> official.
   After taking power, <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON>'s military government arrested
thousands of leftist opponents and exiled them. According to police
figures, more than 9,000 have been authorized to return since <DATE>1982</DATE>.
   Last week, <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON> lifted all states of emergency for the first
time, and on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> he won the formal backing of fellow military
commanders as the sole candidate in the upcoming referendum.
   <PERSON>Patricio Aylwin</PERSON>, president of the centrist <ORGANIZATION>Chrisitian Democratic
Party</ORGANIZATION>, the country's largest, and spokesman for the coalition
challenged <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON> to the televised debate.
   ``An open and free debate is indispensable,'' he said, and would
enable <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON> ``to contrast his ideas with those of the
opposition.''

<TEXT>
   In an outpouring of emotion, tens of
thousands of Chileans lined the streets to view the casket of
toppled Marxist President <PERSON>Salvador Allende</PERSON>, whose remains were
unearthed from a humble grave for an honorable burial.
   <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>'s solemn ceremony, organized by the new democratic
government, came 17 years after <PERSON>Allende</PERSON>'s death in a bloody
military coup.
   The military was conspicuously absent from the ceremonies. Gen.
<PERSON>Augusto Pinochet</PERSON> led the coup against Allende and still heads the
armed forces.
   The day was chosen because it marked 20 years since Allende
became the Western hemisphere's first freely elected Marxist
president.
   As the crowd dispersed after the observances, riot police
blocked small groups who attempted to march to the city center.
   Interior Minister <PERSON>Enrique Kraus</PERSON> said 92 people were detained in
sporadic clashes with police in <LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION> and five in <PERSON>Vina del Mar</PERSON>,
but all were released <DATE>three hours later</DATE>. <LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION> was reported calm
at dusk.
   The official observances were marked by appeals to preserve
<LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>'s newly restored democratic rule.
   ``We express our will to favor the future of our country, which
demands from us to unite beyond the disputes that separated us in
the past,'' President <PERSON>Patricio Aylwin</PERSON> said in a speech at the
cemetery.
   Allende's remains, which had been buried outside the capital,
were placed in a marble mausoleum at <LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION>'s main cemetery,
where other Chilean presidents and dignitaries are buried.
   Aylwin, an elected civilian who was a political foe of Allende,
succeeded <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON> in <DATE>March</DATE>, putting an end to 16{ years of
authoritarian military rule.
   Allende died during an attack on his presidential palace on
<DATE>Sept. 11, 1973</DATE>. The military said he committed suicide rather than
surrender.
   Allende's remains were unearthed early in the day from a modest
family tomb in <ORGANIZATION>Vina del Mar</ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION>, thousands of people lined
the streets to view the flag-draped coffin.
   The procession drove the presidential palace, the <ORGANIZATION>Catholic
Cathedral</ORGANIZATION> and finally the capital's main cemetery.
   Right-wing politicians said the ceremony was a bid to gain
political advantage for the government and the left.
   But the government said the reburial was ``repairing an
unjustice toward a man who was a legitimate president of <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>.''
   Aylwin was booed when he recalled in his speech that he had
opposed the Allende government.
   Raising his voice, the 71-year-old president replied: ``To those

   ``The horror and suffering that <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION> has gone through should
never happen again,'' he continued. ``It's a task for all Chileans
to prevent it, and we will be able to do so only if we reject
hatred and violence.''
   Allende's widow, <PERSON>Hortensia Bussi</PERSON>, said <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>'s ceremonies
``should be seen as a contribution to reconciliation.''
   French Prime Minister <PERSON>Michel Rocard</PERSON>, speaking on behalf of
foreign dignitaries attending the ceremony, stressed the importance
of preserving democracy.
   He said restoration of democracy in <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION> ``shows that freedom
can be momentarily supressed, but it can never be defeated.''
   Security around the ceremonies was tight.
   Four bombs went off overnight in <LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION>, causing minor damage
to two military monuments and two shops but no injuries. A
right-wing group claimed responsibility.

   Soviet television on <DATE>Thursday</DATE> celebrated the defeat of <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>'s
right-wing President <PERSON>Augusto Pinochet</PERSON>, saying voters' rejection of
his bid to rule until <DATE>1997</DATE> proved ``power can be seized by
bayonets, but they cannot keep it.''
   Since <DATE>1973</DATE>, <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON> ``played the role of the firm but just
`father of the nation,' trying to make Chileans forget the bloody
history of his ascension to the throne, his betrayal of the
Constitution, the murder of Salvador Allende,'' Soviet political
observer <PERSON>I. Fesynenko</PERSON> said on the TV.
   But <PERSON>Fesynenko</PERSON> noted that: ``First of all, <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON> will be in
power until <DATE>March 1990</DATE>, and only in <DATE>December 1989</DATE> will presidential
elections be held in the country, if the dictatorship does not
abolish them first.''
   In <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Sen. Edward M. Kennedy</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-Mass.</LOCATION>, said the people
of <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION> ``have spoke eloquently, convincingly and courageously.
After 15 years of military rule, <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION> has said `No' to
dictatorship and `Yes' to democracy.
   ``We congratulate the people of <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION> for having given the world
such an impressive demonstration of the power of the ballot box,''
said <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON>Phyllis Oakley</PERSON>.
   The West German government called on <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>'s military leaders to
abide by terms for the nation's democratization.
   ``We hope that the government will now hold to its own promised
timetable and continue on a course to allow open and free
elections,'' government spokesman <PERSON>Herbert Schmuelling</PERSON> said.
   <PERSON>George Foulkes</PERSON>, a foreign affairs spokesman for the British
opposition <ORGANIZATION>Labor Party</ORGANIZATION> and one of 500 foreigners who visited <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>
to view the balloting, said, ``It's a tremendous triumph for
democracy in <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>, a totally unique situation where a dictator has
been voted out in a plebiscite.''
   Foulkes added, ``It is absolutely crucial now to ensure that
<PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON> fully accepts the decision of the Chilean people.''
   Some Latin leaders reacted with restrained pleasure.
   InArgentina, President <PERSON>Raul Alfonsin</PERSON> said, ``The people of <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>
have expressed their inalienable right to decide their own future.
The results of plebiscite open the way toward the restoration of
democracy.''
   Foreign Minister <PERSON>Roberto de Abreu Sodre</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> said,
``Defeating a dictatorship is not easy, but when a government stays
a long time in office it becomes a heavy burden to the people.''
   Mexican Foreign Minister <PERSON>Bernardo Sepulveda Amor</PERSON>, in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>
for the <ORGANIZATION>U.N. General Assembly</ORGANIZATION>, said: ``We congratulate the Chilean
people for this proof of civic maturity, for this capacity to
transform their own political lives in an orderly manner.''
   The Mexican government, which broke relations with <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION> after
the <DATE>1973</DATE> coup, gave asylum to many Chileans, including <PERSON>Hortensia
Bussi</PERSON>, President Allende's widow. Bussi recently returned to
<LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION> after the military government allowed exiles to return.
   President <PERSON>Francois Mitterrand</PERSON> of <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> said he learned ``with a
profound joy of the results of the referendum in <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION> and of the
perspectives opening up for the re-establishment of democracy,
suffocated 15 years ago in this country.''
   In <LOCATION>Rome</LOCATION>, legislators rose to their feet in <LOCATION>Parliament</LOCATION> to applaud
the news of <LOCATION>Pinochet</LOCATION>'s defeat. The government immediately named a
new ambassador to <LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION>, a post long vacant in a sign of protest.
   <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Foreign Office</ORGANIZATION> said, ``We hope that the plebiscite
result, which appears to reflect the will of the Chilean people,
will represent an important first step on the path back toward full
democracy.''
   Spanish Foreign Minister <PERSON>Francisco Fernandez Ordonez</PERSON> said ``the
people of <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION> have given a great lesson of political maturity.''
   Added <PERSON>Laurent Fabius</PERSON>, speaker of the <ORGANIZATION>French National Assembly</ORGANIZATION>,
``It's a country that suffered terribly for 15 years ... and now,
all of a sudden, there is light and hope again.''

<TEXT>
   Gen. <PERSON>Augusto Pinochet</PERSON>, marking the 17th
anniversary of the coup he led in <DATE>1973</DATE>, said <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> he would stage
another takeover again if confronted with similar circumstances.
   ``Should the circumstances of <DATE>1973</DATE> repeat, I would act in the
same manner,'' the 74-year-old army commander and former president
said.
   ``My only goal then was to rescue <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>'' from ``a Marxist
government that was working to disintegrate the country,'' he told
a group of right-wing politicians.
   Meanwhile, police said three people were injured, one of whom
was shot in the arm, and 48 arrested in scattered clashes
throughout the city linked to the anniversary.
   Most of the incidents occurred when rival groups celebrating or
denouncing the anniversary clashed in the streets. Police used
water cannon to disperse people, and the government said calm had
been restored by midafternoon.
   Police said they were investigating the wounding of a
21-year-old man who was shot as he left <LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION>'s main cemetery
after visiting the tomb of <PERSON>Salvador Allende</PERSON>, the man <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON>
toppled in the coup.
   Pinochet spoke briefly to the leaders of the <ORGANIZATION>Independent
Democratic Union</ORGANIZATION>, a rightist group, who visited him at his home to
``thank him'' for the <DATE>1973</DATE> coup that ousted <PERSON>Allende</PERSON>, a Marxist who
was elected president by the Chilean populace.
   Pinochet led the armed forces in the coup, which took place
during a time of deep social, political and economic crisis.
   Pinochet stayed in power for 16{ years until <DATE>March 11</DATE>, when he
was succeeded by President <PERSON>Patricio Aylwin</PERSON>, an elected civilian.
   After relinquishing the presidency to <PERSON>Aylwin</PERSON>, <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON> remained
commander in chief of the army, sheltered by a special clause in
the <DATE>1980</DATE> constitution written by his government that prevents
<PERSON>Aylwin</PERSON> from firing him.
   The coup anniversary was marked by the military with a series of
private ceremonies at barracks throughout the country.
   The civilian government ignored the celebrations, but ministers
and officials attended a Catholic Mass at the presidential palace
for the hundreds of people who died in the coup and in the severe
repression that followed it.
   Among those who died was Allende, who was killed the day of the
coup as his presidential palace in downtown <LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION> came under
heavy ground and air attack.
   Leftist politicians and relatives of the victims visited
cemeteries to pay tribute to the dead.
   Hundreds paraded in front of the new marble mausoleum where
Allende's remains were reburied one week ago at <LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION>'s main
cemetery. They were led by <ORGANIZATION>Allende</ORGANIZATION>'s widow, <PERSON>Hortensia Bussi</PERSON>, his
daughters and other relatives and aides of his government.
   In <LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION>, police used water cannons to scatter small groups
of demonstrators both celebrating and denouncing the coup
anniversary. Twelve people were briefly detained, according to
deputy Interior Minister <PERSON>Belisario Velasco</PERSON>.
   Also in <LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION>, two bombs went off during the night, police
said, causing no victims but damaging a bank and the office of a
right wing party. No victims were reported.
   Several hundred people gathered early in the morning in front of
<LOCATION>Pinochet</LOCATION>'s house in a fashionable <LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION> neighborhood, to cheer
the former president as he left for a ceremony and Mass at the
<ORGANIZATION>Military Academy</ORGANIZATION>.
   Many of the demonstrators later marched through the <LOCATION>Providencia</LOCATION>
district streets chanting slogans against the <PERSON>Aylwin</PERSON> government.
They also chanted ``Pinochet will come back, <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON> will come
back.''

   Hundreds of thousands of people jammed a
broad avenue <DATE>Saturday</DATE> to call for the rejection of President
<PERSON>Augusto Pinochet</PERSON> in a nationwide referendum this week.
   Organizers said 1.2 million people packed a working class
neighborhood about five miles south of the center of <LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION> for
the demonstration marking the official close of the opposition's
campaign.
   After the rally ended, small groups marched downtown and clashed
with police, who dispersed them with water cannons. Police said
more than 20 people were arrested.
   Police did not give an estimate of the size of the crowd at the
rally, but reporters on the scene said it was in excess of 350,000.
   Chileans are to vote <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> to approve or reject <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON>,
the 72-year-old president and army commander who seized power in a
bloody <DATE>1973</DATE> coup. Elected President <PERSON>Salvador Allende</PERSON>, a Marxist,
was ousted and died in the coup.
   Pro- and anti-government forces have been waging ardent but
relatively peaceful campaigns.
   The opposition gathering was the largest of the campaign and one
of the biggest gatherings in memory in <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>. Long columns of
people marched from various points of the city, many carrying
Chilean flags and opposition signs and chanting anti-government
slogans.
   <PERSON>Patricio Aylwin</PERSON>, leader of a 16-party coalition opposing
<PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON> in the referendum, told the festive rally that an
opposition victory would pave the way to ``a peaceful, fast and
orderly transition to democracy'' after 15 years of military rule.
   Aylwin called on the military to ``facilitate the respect to the
people's will,'' if the opposition wins the presidential vote.
   He promised that if the government wins and the vote is fair,
the opposition will accept the result.
   ``We are going to win, and that will bring us democracy,'' said
<PERSON>Aylwin</PERSON>, president of the centrist Christian Democratic party.
   If a majority approve <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON> as president, he will begin a new
eight-year term in <DATE>March</DATE>. If he is rejected, democratic elections
are to take place in <DATE>December 1989</DATE>, with <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON> remaining in
power until a new president takes office.
   In either case, elections for congress, suspended since <DATE>1973</DATE>,
are planned for <DATE>1990</DATE>.
   Virtually all opposition figures from left to right attended the
rally, including <PERSON>Hotensia Bussi de Allende</PERSON>, widow of the former
president.
   Pinochet on <DATE>Saturday</DATE> traveled to the agricultural city of
<LOCATION>Rancagua</LOCATION>, 50 miles south of <LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION>, and led a rally by thousands
of supporters in a local stadium.
   At the stadium he told the crowd the opposition was directed by
``the same people who in the past tried to destroy the patrimony
and who halted our development, relegating thousands of Chilean to
poverty.''
   The government forces were preparing their own campaign closing
rally for <DATE>Sunday</DATE> in <LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION>. According to election law, all
campaign activities must cease by <TIME>midnight</TIME> <DATE>Sunday</DATE>.

Seventeen years after a coup overthrew a democratically elected government 
strongly opposed by the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> on <DATE>Thursday</DATE> saluted the 
re-establishment of Chilean democracy, which he said has been "every bit as 
far-reaching" as the revolutions that overthrew Communist governments in 
<LOCATION>Eastern Europe</LOCATION> last year. 
</P>
<P>
"In <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>, once more, the people shall govern," <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> said in a speech to the 
<ORGANIZATION>Chilean Congress</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
For the President, it was a day of symbolism -- one in which, as in <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> a 
day earlier, the elements of newly inaugurated democracy barely covered up 
reminders of the time when military regimes tightly controlled political life 
and economic activity. 
</P>
<P>
He met at lunch with President <PERSON>Patricio Aylwin</PERSON>, elected last <DATE>December</DATE> and 
inaugurated in <DATE>March</DATE> -- and he shook hands and chatted briefly with <PERSON>Augusto 
Pinochet</PERSON>, the military dictator for 16 1/2 years. Pinochet has continued in a 
position of influence, as chief of the Chilean army. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the week, as <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> has traveled from <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Uruguay</LOCATION>, 
<LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> and over the <LOCATION>Andes</LOCATION> on <DATE>Thursday</DATE> to <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>, he has drawn attention to 
the renewal of democracy throughout the hemisphere and, in particular, the move 
toward less government control over debt-ridden economies. 
</P>
<P>
The President, who winds up the tour with an overnight stop tonight in 
<LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION>, told the legislators: "Every year under autocratic rule served only 
to deepen your devotion to freedom and tolerance and respect for human rights, 
to strengthen <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>'s collective resolve to make this return to democracy 
permanent and to make it irreversible." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, he saluted the economic progress <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION> has made over the 
past five years, as a result of <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON>'s free-market policies and their 
acceptance by <PERSON>Aylwin</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
Those policies, along with the political stability that the repressive Pinochet 
government imposed upon <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION> by tightly controlling dissent, figured in the 
creation of an economic climate that began attracting foreign investors back to 
<LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>. In the early <DATE>1970s</DATE>, nationalization of key industries under the 
government of Marxist President <PERSON>Salvador Allende</PERSON> resulted in economic and 
political turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
"Since <DATE>1985</DATE>, about <MONEY>$2.5 billion</MONEY> in new investment has flowed into <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>," the 
President said. "Capital flight, which has sapped the economic strength of so 
many Latin nations, has now reversed itself, turned around with returning funds 
spurring new investment here." 
</P>
<P>
He spoke at the starkly modern legislative building, still under construction 
in the seaside city of <LOCATION>Valparaiso</LOCATION>, which he reached by a 40-minute ride aboard 
his Marine One helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
At a state dinner <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> in <LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> told Chileans: "You deserve 
your reputation as an economic model for other countries in the region and the 
world. Your economic growth is the pride of <LOCATION>Latin America</LOCATION>." 
</P>
<P>
The dinner was held at <ORGANIZATION>La Moneda</ORGANIZATION>, the presidential palace in downtown <LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION> 
where Allende took his life as tanks and aircraft attacked in the <DATE>September, 
1973</DATE>, coup. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>White House Press</ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON>Marlin Fitzwater</PERSON> described the reception <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> has 
been given here and at the three previous stops on his journey as "a love fest" 
compared with the unease with which <LOCATION>South America</LOCATION> has often regarded the <LOCATION>United 
States</LOCATION> -- and with the rocky reception some <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> politicians have received. 
</P>
<P>
But the reception was not entirely friendly. 
</P>
<P>
A decoy limousine driven just ahead of the President's armored car in a 
motorcade was hit by an egg. And at least six bombs exploded in <LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION> during 
the night <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, before <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> arrived midday <DATE>Thursday</DATE>. Police reported that 
no one was injured. 
</P>
<P>
Before the visit, the <ORGANIZATION>Bush Administration</ORGANIZATION> worked to ease some of the sore 
points in U.S.-Chilean relations. Last <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> lifted a ban on military 
aid and sales to <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION> that was imposed in <DATE>1976</DATE> after former Chilean Foreign 
Minister <PERSON>Orlando Letelier</PERSON>, a prominent foe of <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON>, and an American aide, 
<PERSON>Ronni Moffit</PERSON>, were killed in a car bombing in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
In another move also intended to patch up differences, in late <LOCATION>November Chile</LOCATION> 
was allowed back into the Generalized System of Preferences, which grants 
tariff concessions. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Finance Minister <PERSON>Alejandro Foxley</PERSON> has said, <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION> will be able to 
increase exports to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> by approximately <MONEY>$100 million</MONEY> from the 
present <MONEY>$1.45 billion</MONEY> a year. The <ORGANIZATION>Reagan Administration</ORGANIZATION> had excluded <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION> from 
the system in <DATE>1988</DATE> to protest <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON>'s repression of the Chilean labor 
movement.

<HEAD>US-Chile Agreement a Major Step, State Department Negotiator Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One more step remains before US-Chilean
relations can be normalized, now that <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION> has agreed to pay
compensation for the <DATE>1976</DATE> slaying in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> of a Chilean
opposition figure and his aide, a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> negotiator says.
   The ``agreement in principle'' was concluded last week following
talks between Chilean and <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> negotiators in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>State
Department</ORGANIZATION> legal adviser <PERSON>Abraham D. Sofaer</PERSON> said <DATE>Sunday</DATE>.
   He said the second step toward normalizing relations is to see
that the killers of Chilean exile leader <PERSON>Orlando Letelier</PERSON> and his
aide, <PERSON>Ronni Moffitt</PERSON>, are brought to justice. Letelier and <PERSON>Moffitt</PERSON>
died in a car bombing in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>.
   ``Once we have both those things done, relations between both
these two countries can be completely normalized,'' <PERSON>Sofaer</PERSON> said.
``So it is very significant. It has taken us years to get here.''
   The agreement with the new government of Chilean President
<PERSON>Patricio Aylwin</PERSON> marks a reversal of the stance taken by <PERSON>Aylwin</PERSON>'s
predecessor, right-wing Gen. <PERSON>Augusto Pinochet</PERSON>, who seized power in
the <DATE>1973</DATE> overthrow.
   Aylwin, who defeated a Pinochet-backed candidate in elections to
replace the military government, has promised full cooperation with
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> officials in the case. Aylwin took power in <DATE>March</DATE>.
   Sofaer underscored that <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION> would make payments without
conceding any government liability for the death of Letelier, who
served in the government of <PERSON>Salvador Allende</PERSON>, a Marxist president
who died in a <DATE>1973</DATE> coup in <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>.
   ``We have agreed in principle to arbitration, in effect, to set
an amount of compensation to be paid to those people damaged by the
bombing,'' he said. The amount would be set by an international
tribunal.
   At the time of the <DATE>Sept. 21, 1976</DATE>, bombing, Letelier and <PERSON>Ms.
Moffitt</PERSON> were working for the <ORGANIZATION>Institute for Policy Studies</ORGANIZATION>. The
survivors include <ORGANIZATION>Letelier</ORGANIZATION>'s widow and <PERSON>Ms. Moffitt</PERSON>'s husband.
   A federal judge in <DATE>1980</DATE> concluded that the <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON> government
and its agents were responsible for the deaths of Letelier and
<PERSON>Moffitt</PERSON> and ordered the Chilean government to pay <MONEY>$2.9 million</MONEY> in
compensation to the survivors.
   But the relatives have been unable to collect, and the <LOCATION>United
States</LOCATION> is expected to ask the tribunal to award at least the <MONEY>$2.9
million</MONEY> and 10 years' interest, The <ORGANIZATION>New York Times</ORGANIZATION> reported <DATE>Sunday</DATE>.
   In <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>, the issue of reparations has been seen as key battle
between <PERSON>Aylwin</PERSON> and <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON>, who remains as army commander and has
promised to block human rights investigations of the military.
   Letelier served as ambassador to <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> and was foreign
minister during the Allende rule. In exile after the coup, he
became a severe critic of <ORGANIZATION>Pinochet</ORGANIZATION>'s rule.
   <PERSON>Sofaer</PERSON> said the issue of civil payments is wholly separate from
criminal cases in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> against former officials of the
Chilean secret police indicted in the killings.

<HEAD>Widow of Allende Moves Back to Chile</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The widow of former President <PERSON>Salvador
Allende</PERSON> returned for good to her homeland <DATE>Monday</DATE> and said she would
attend the weekend ceremony in which Gen. <PERSON>Augusto Pinochet</PERSON>, who led
the coup that toppled her husband's government, gives up power.
   ``I want to spend my last years here,'' <PERSON>Hortensia Bussi de
Allende</PERSON>, 75, told reporters at <LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION>'s international airport.
She arrived from <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>, where she lived for more than a decade in
exile.
   She was met by <ORGANIZATION>Socialist Party</ORGANIZATION> officials and by a daughter,
<LOCATION>Isabel</LOCATION>, and granddaughter, <PERSON>Marcia</PERSON>. A small crowd cheered her
arrival, which was virtually unpublicized.
   <PERSON>Mrs. Allende</PERSON> said she would attend <DATE>Sunday</DATE>'s inaugural ceremony,
in which <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON> hands over the presidency to an elected
successor, <PERSON>Patricio Aylwin</PERSON>, in the port city of <LOCATION>Valparaiso</LOCATION>.
   Asked if she planned to participate in the new government, she
replied: ``No. I've always said we have to make way for the younger
people.''
   Aylwin, a Christian Democrat, is backed by a coalition of 17
centrist and leftist parties, including the Socialist Party that
Allende once led.
   <PERSON>Mrs. Allende</PERSON> said she would lobby to have her husband's remains
moved to ``a deserved spot in <LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION>, where everyone can pay him
homage, and to have a grand monument built.''
   Allende died in the presidential palace while it was being
bombarded by the military during a coup on <DATE>Sept. 11, 1973</DATE>.
According to witnesses, he committed suicide with a machine gun
when it became evident his leftist government was falling.
   He was buried in the unpretentious plot of a brother-in-law, in
the coastal resort of <ORGANIZATION>Vina del Mar</ORGANIZATION>, near <LOCATION>Valparaiso</LOCATION>. The military
kept the grave unmarked for many years.
   The military forced <PERSON>Mrs. Allende</PERSON> to leave the country within
days of the coup.
   She first returned in late <DATE>1988</DATE> after <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON>, campaigning for
an eight-year extension of his rule, ordered an end to her exile
and that of hundreds of other dissidents. Voters in an <DATE>October 1988</DATE>
referendum rejected the extension for <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON>, forcing him to call
elections.

<HEAD>Pinochet Lifts Ban on Exiles; Opponents Dismiss Move As

<TEXT>
   Right-wing President <PERSON>Augusto Pinochet</PERSON>
announced that hundreds of his critics living in exile may return
to <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>, but opponents said the move, and others like it, are
aimed only at winning votes in a presidential referendum.
   Four hours after <DATE>Thursday</DATE>'s announcement, <PERSON>Isabel Allende</PERSON>, 44,
the daughter of former President <PERSON>Salvador Allende</PERSON>, flew to
<LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION>. She has been living in <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> since her father, a
self-proclaimed Marxist, died during a bloody coup led by <DATE>Pinochet
15 years ago</DATE>.
   Asked why she returned, she told reporters at the airport,
``Because it's my legitimate right.''
   She said her mother, <PERSON>Hortensia Bussi</PERSON>, the exiled widow of
Allende, also plans to return. ``We are going to prepare a grand
entrance, through the front door, as we've always said,'' <PERSON>Ms.
Allende</PERSON> said.
   <PERSON>Jose Oyarce</PERSON>, a Communist who was labor minister in the Allende
government, returned to his homeland on the same flight as <PERSON>Ms.
Allende</PERSON>.
   Pinochet lifted a ban on the return of 430 Chileans who had
opposed him, including some of the fiercest leftist opponents of
his military government.
   ``The prohibitions are lifted. All of them,'' the president told
reporters. ``I have spoken this morning with the interior minister
and have given instructions with respect to exile that totally
solves this problem.''
   Opponents said the army general is only trying to lure voters in
an <DATE>Oct. 5</DATE> presidential referendum in which <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON> is the sole
candidate.
   His nomination for the referendum was made <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> by <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON>
himself and the commanders of the <ORGANIZATION>navy</ORGANIZATION>, air force and national
police. It sparked nationwide anti-government protests.
   If the majority of Chileans vote ``no'' in the ballot, an open
election is to be held. If they vote ``yes,'' <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON> would begin
an eight-year term as president in <DATE>March</DATE>.
   ``The regime is trying to change (<ORGANIZATION>Pinochet</ORGANIZATION>'s) image on the eve
of the referendum,'' said <PERSON>Patricio Aylwin</PERSON>, leader of a 16-party
opposition coalition.
   Aylwin challenged <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON> to a ``free and open'' debate on
national television, ``so he can have the opportunity to contrast
his ideas with those of the opposition.''
   In another move opponents say was aimed at winning the
referendum, <LOCATION>Pinochet</LOCATION> <DATE>last week</DATE> lifted the state of emergency that
has suppressed civil liberties since the <DATE>1973</DATE> coup.
   The president also ordered a <PERCENT>3 percent</PERCENT> reduction in the price of
gasoline.
   On <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON> made a conciliatory gesture toward his
critics, appealing for their support in a nationally televised
speech.
   ``There is a new democracy ahead of us. We must work together to
make it efficient,'' the 72-year-old general said. ``Our democracy
has a place for everybody.''
   The tone of the speech contrasted sharply with <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON>'s past
references to opposition leaders, whom he has called ``traitors''
and ``bandits'' who ``sell out their motherland.''
   Pinochet told reporters at the government palace <DATE>Thursday</DATE> that
he is not shifting his style in an effort to change his
authoritarian image.
   ``What happens is that a person must act according to the
circumstances,'' he said.
   Supporters praised <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON>'s moves as proof of his intention to
hold an honest referendum.
   ``The decision of ending exile is part of the President's appeal
to peace and unity of all Chileans,'' said Interior Minister <PERSON>Sergio
Fernandez</PERSON>.
   <PERSON>Carlos Cabello</PERSON>, leader of an independent organization supporting
<PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON>, said ``the move shows the President's deep democratic
conviction.''
   But <PERSON>Jose Sanfuentes</PERSON>, a spokesman for the outlawed <ORGANIZATION>Communist
Party</ORGANIZATION>, said: ``Pinochet will take other measures to try to buy out
the consciences of Chileans, but these measures will not prevent
the collapse of his dictatorship.''

<HEAD>Best-Selling Novelist Allende Visits Homeland for First Time in 13

<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Novelist <PERSON>Isabel Allende</PERSON> declared <DATE>Monday</DATE>
that the defeat of military President <PERSON>Augusto Pinochet</PERSON> in a
political referendum was ``an historic moment'' and that democracy
has been restored to <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>.
   She made the comments at a news conference in <LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION> during her
first trip back to her homeland after 13 years of self-imposed exile.
   The author of the best-selling ``House of the Spirits'' also said
<PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON> is a dictator like others who have ruled Latin American
countries.
   ``I'm not really interested in talking about him personally
because he's no different from other cases and is not a particularly
interesting person.''
   However, she said she wept when she learned in <DATE>October</DATE> that
Chileans rejected by 3.9 million to 3.1 million a proposal that Gen.
<PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON> remain in power until <DATE>1997</DATE>.
   ``I believe the silent decision that every Chilean made on <DATE>Oct. 5</DATE>
is an historic moment in the return of democracy,'' she said.
   She was in <LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION> at the time and telephoned <LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION> to
discuss the results with <PERSON>Hortensia Allende</PERSON>, widow of ousted civilian
President <PERSON>Salvador Allende</PERSON>. ``We couldn't talk, we just cried,'' she
said.
   <PERSON>Mrs. Allende</PERSON>'s father was a cousin of <PERSON>Salvador Allende</PERSON>, the
Marxist who died when <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON> toppled his elected government in a
bloody <DATE>1973</DATE> coup.
   Pinochet's referendum defeat obliged him to call elections for
next <DATE>December</DATE>. He is to hand over power in <DATE>March 1990</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Mrs. Allende</PERSON>, 46, has written three novels since she left <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>
in <DATE>1975</DATE> for self-exile in <LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION>, where she remained for 13
years. This year, she moved to <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>.
   She returned to <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION> on <DATE>Saturday</DATE> for a two-week visit with
family and said of her homeland: ``It feels the same, like not a day
has passed.''
   But she said she had no plans to re-establish residence in the
country.
   She said that while abroad ``every time I've had a chance to talk
publicly about <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION> and condemn the dictatorship I've done so.''
   ``I believe my mission ends with the arrival of democracy in
<LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>,'' she said, adding: ``I believe it has arrived.''
   <PERSON>Mrs. Allende</PERSON> said she now is preparing a book of short stories,
including material culled from her third and latest novel, ``<PERSON>Eva
Luna</PERSON>.'' The book describes the experiences of an uneducated but
savvy peasant girl who seeks her fortune in a Venezuelan city.
   ``House of the Spirits,'' which was published in more than a
dozen languages, is the saga of several generations of a Chilean
family living in <LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION>.
   Asked to comment on critics who compare her work with that of
renowned Colombian author <PERSON>Gabriel Garcia Marquez</PERSON>, she quipped:
``This must make <PERSON>Garcia Marquez</PERSON> unhappy.''
   She said she is influenced by <PERSON>Garcia Marquez</PERSON> and <PERSON>Pablo Neruda</PERSON>,
the late Nobel Prize-winning Chilean poet. She said her work and
<PERSON>Garcia Marquez</PERSON>' share only a style known as ``magical realism''
which mixes fantasy with reality.

   Critics accused President <PERSON>Augusto
Pinochet</PERSON> on <DATE>Friday</DATE> of lifting the exile ban only to gain votes, but
whatever the motive, many Chilean artists and performers will be
able to work in their own country.
   Gen. <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON>, who seeks to win eight more years in office as
the sole candidate in a presidential referendum <DATE>Oct. 5</DATE>, announced
<DATE>Thursday</DATE> that all 430 remaining political exiles may come home.
   One daughter of the late President <PERSON>Salvador Allende</PERSON>, overthrown
in the coup led by <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON> in <DATE>September 1973</DATE>, already has returned
and <ORGANIZATION>Allende</ORGANIZATION>'s widow and other daughter have said they will come
back.
   Among other people affected is <PERSON>Miguel Littin</PERSON>, an acclaimed movie
maker whose ``Acts of Marusia'' was nominated for an Academy Award
as the best foreign film of <DATE>1985</DATE>. Littin and thousands of other
Chileans went into exile soon after the coup.
   It will not be Littin's first return. He spent several weeks
here in <DATE>1986</DATE> shooting scenes for a documentary on <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>, but he was
disguised, used an assumed name and posed as a member of an Italian
television crew.
   That film, ``General Act of <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>,'' is critical of the <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON>
militry regime and has been shown at several European movie
festivals.
   An account of the secret visit was written later by Colombian
author <PERSON>Gabriel Garcia Marquez</PERSON>, a Nobel laureate and close friend of
Littin.
   <PERSON>Garcia Marquez</PERSON> wrote that Littin visited several Chilean cities
and on one occasion stood only a few yards from <LOCATION>Pinochet</LOCATION> while
filming a ceremony.
   On <DATE>Friday</DATE>, the <LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION> newspaper La Epoca quoted Littin as
saying by telephone from his home in <LOCATION>Madrid</LOCATION> that he would return to
<LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION> ``in the next few hours, or in a week.''
   Littin now is shooting ``Sandino,'' a film about the late
Nicaraguan revolutionary leader <PERSON>Cesar Augusto Sandino</PERSON> with American
actor <PERSON>Dustin Hoffman</PERSON> playing the role of Sandino.
   Also expected to return is <PERSON>Helvio Soto</PERSON>, a movie maker who has
had been working in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>.
   Two folk groups noted for protest songs, <PERSON>Inti Illimani</PERSON> and
Quilapallun, have performed successfully in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> for years.
   <PERSON>Inti Illimani</PERSON>, now based in <LOCATION>Rome</LOCATION>, was on a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> tour when
<PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON> made his announcement.
   Quilapallun is based in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>. It was not known if either group
planned to return.
   <PERSON>Patricio Manns</PERSON>, a folk musician who lives in <LOCATION>Switzerland</LOCATION>, also
can come back. In <DATE>1986</DATE> he became an ``international spokesman'' for
the <ORGANIZATION>Manuel Rodriguez Patriotic Front</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>'s main leftist
guerrilla group.
   Manns announced in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> that the guerrillas claimed
responsability for the <DATE>Sept. 6, 1986</DATE>, attempt to assasinate
<PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON>, the army commander. The president escaped harm in the
ambush of his motorcade on a road in the <LOCATION>Andes</LOCATION> foothills near
<LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION> but six bodyguards were killed and 11 wounded.
   La Epoca quoted <PERSON>Manns</PERSON>, also a poet and author, as saying he had
not decided whether to return and wanted ``security guarantees''
from the government.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Chilean Journalists Association</ORGANIZATION> said 32 journalists are

   Opposition candidate <PERSON>Patricio Aylwin</PERSON>
trounced Gen. <PERSON>Augusto Pinochet</PERSON>'s former finance minister <DATE>Thursday</DATE>
in elections to end the right-wing military president's 16-year
rule.
   Official election results from <PERCENT>93 percent</PERCENT> of the country's 7.5
million registered voters showed <PERSON>Aylwin</PERSON> with 3.58 million votes, or
<PERCENT>55.2 percent</PERCENT>, enough for an absolute majority.
   Interior Ministry returns had <PERSON>Hernan Buchi</PERSON>, the former finance
minister credited with designing a policy of economic growth and
low inflation from <DATE>1985</DATE> until <DATE>May</DATE>, finishing a distant second with
1.9 million votes, or <PERCENT>29.4 percent</PERCENT>.
   At <TIME>midnight</TIME>, Interior Minister <PERSON>Carlos Caceres</PERSON> formally
recognized <PERSON>Aylwin</PERSON>'s victory and pledged the government will abide
by the result.
   Under Chilean law, <PERSON>Aylwin</PERSON> is to take office for four years
beginning <DATE>March 11</DATE>.
   Earlier <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>evening</TIME>, <PERSON>Buchi</PERSON> conceded defeat, declaring, ``We
have returned to democracy. <PERSON>Mr. Patricio Aylwin</PERSON> has been elected
president of the republic by the people of <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>.''
   Motorists honked their horns in celebration and supporters of
the 71-year-old <PERSON>Aylwin</PERSON>, a moderate Christian Democrat, rushed into
the streets of this capital to hail the victory. Fireworks dotted
the sky and lines of flag-waving citizens crammed the main
thoroughfares early <DATE>Friday</DATE>.
   On one large white banner was painted a portrait of ex-President
<PERSON>Salvador Allende</PERSON>, a Marxist whose elected 3-year-old government was
toppled by <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON> in a <DATE>1973</DATE> coup. The banner quoted one of the
final statements of <LOCATION>Allende</LOCATION>, who died during the coup: ``I have
faith in <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION> and its future.''
   In a victory speech delivered shortly after <TIME>midnight</TIME> (<TIME>10 p.m.
EST</TIME> <DATE>Thursday</DATE>) from a downtown hotel balcony, <PERSON>Aylwin</PERSON> declared: ``The
people of <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION> have taken their future destiny back into their own
hands.''
   He then asked the crowd to return peacefully to their homes and
prepare for an official street celebrations <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME>.
   A long-shot third candidate, populist businessman <PERSON>Francisco
Errazuriz</PERSON>, also conceded defeat, saying, ``<PERSON>Mr. Aylwin</PERSON> has won an
absolute majority.'' Errazuriz had 998,000 votes or <PERCENT>15 percent</PERCENT>,
according to the count. There were 114,000 null and blank ballots,
the <ORGANIZATION>Ministry</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>late Thursday</DATE>.
   In his first public reaction, <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON> applauded the
peacefulness and normality of the voting, and attributed the margin
of victory to a better organized opposition.
   One serious voting day incident was reported in this nation of
12 million people: police said a gunman fled after killing a
23-year-old officer guarding a polling station in a working-class
district in southern <LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION>. No details were given.
   Voters also elected 38 Senators and 120 <ORGANIZATION>House of Deputies</ORGANIZATION>
members, but results were not immediately available. Scattered
returns reported by local radio and television networks showed the
opposition coalition leading in most of the races.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> also will include up to 10 members appointed by,
among others, the president, <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court and National Security
Council</ORGANIZATION>.
   While a funereal atmosphere was evident at <PERSON>Buchi</PERSON> campaign
headquarters, across town <PERSON>Aylwin</PERSON> campaign official <PERSON>Enrique Krauss</PERSON>
said with a smile, ``The results show the unquestionable victory of
<PERSON>Patricio Aylwin</PERSON>.''
   Aylwin, who represented an alliance of 17 centrist and leftist
parties, had been heavily favored in most pre-election surveys.
   The presidential count included returns from all of <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>'s 12
official regions. In only one, the southern 11th region, did <PERSON>Aylwin</PERSON>
win less than in absolute majority _ <PERCENT>46 percent</PERCENT>.
   With an absolute majority, <PERSON>Aylwin</PERSON> avoided a two-candidate
runoff, which the constitution required if no nominee won more than
<PERCENT>50 percent</PERCENT> of the total.
   <PERSON>Buchi</PERSON>, 40, was backed by pro-government parties. Errazuriz, a
47-year-old millionaire, had been expected to run a distant third.
   Pinochet and other top military officials claimed responsibility
<DATE>Thursday</DATE> for leading <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION> back to democracy. It was a model in
<LOCATION>Latin America</LOCATION> before <DATE>1973</DATE>, and economically has done well in recent
years exporting wine, copper, fish, fruit and lumber.
   Aylwin, surrounded by bodyguards supplied by the government,
voted early at a school near his home in <LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION>, and was cheered
by bystanders as he pushed through a crush of journalists.
   When <PERSON>Buchi</PERSON> voted, he was greeted by <PERSON>Aylwin</PERSON> backers who taunted
him with chants of ``Aylwin, president!'' He did not respond.
   Voting is mandatory in <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION> and people failing to vote can be
fined <MONEY>$95</MONEY>. For nearly half of the 7.5 million registered voters,
this was their first real election.
   Some people arrived before dawn at the polling places and waited
in lines that stretched for blocks to receive their three paper
ballots: one each for president, <ORGANIZATION>Senate and House of Deputies</ORGANIZATION>.
   The peaceful atmosphere mirrored that of <DATE>October 1988</DATE>, when
Chileans rejected a referendum proposal that <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON> lead the
country until <DATE>1997</DATE>, forcing him to schedule elections.
   Hundreds of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and European observers are in the country,
although none have been officially recognized by the government. It
allowed them in as tourists, saying no foreign supervision of the
vote was needed.
   Pinochet complained bitterly <DATE>Thursday</DATE> about their presence,
saying they came ``to control the pesos they gave to politicians.''
   Pinochet's right-wing administration frequently has accused the
political opposition of selling out to foreign political parties
and pro-democracy groups that donated money.
   Pinochet, meeting with reporters at the presidential palace,
said he was angered by two things: ``One, because they come to
control the pesos they gave to politicians and political parties.
Second, they come to meddle believing that there will be
irregularities, bad things, and this isn't so.''
   Among the polling stations <DATE>Thursday</DATE> was <ORGANIZATION>National Stadium</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION>, which became a symbol of political repression after the
<DATE>1973</DATE> coup. The military penned up thousands of dissidents in the
stadium and, according to human rights groups, killed or tortured
many.
   Similar roundups occurred elsewhere in <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>.
   Although he must step down as president, <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON> has said he
will retain command of the 60,000-man army. A provision of the
constitution written by his regime prohibits the new president from
dismissing him until <DATE>1998</DATE>.

<HEAD>U.S. Moving to Restore Relations With Democratic Chile</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> is moving to quickly
normalize relations with <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>'s new democratic government, the
<ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   This could include the lifting of economic sanctions and the end
of restrictions on military aid and arms sales.
   ``The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> applauds the return to democracy in <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>,''
the <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION> said in a statement. ``We hope to normalize
quickly all of our relations with the new government in <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>,
including economic, political and defense relations.''
   The department's statement comes one month after the
inauguration of President <PERSON>Patricio Aylwin</PERSON> to replace dictator Gen.
<PERSON>Augusto Pinochet</PERSON>.
   Pinochet ruled <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION> with an iron hand after the coup that
ousted Socialist President <PERSON>Salvador Allende Gossens</PERSON> in <DATE>September
1973</DATE>. Thousands of Allende's supporters were rounded up and many
were tortured or killed.
   Pinochet remains head of the Chilean armed forces.
   But Vice President <PERSON>Dan Quayle</PERSON>, who attended <PERSON>Aylwin</PERSON>'s <DATE>March 11</DATE>
inauguration in <LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION>, said <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON> assured him he would follow
the policies of the new civilian government.
   The <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION> said a review will open soon on <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>'s
petition for the restoration of easier tariff treatment of its
exports and its request for renewed participation in the programs
of the <ORGANIZATION>Overseas Private Investment Corp</ORGANIZATION>.
   <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION> was suspended from participation in these programs in <DATE>1987</DATE>
due to workers' rights issues, the department said.
   Organized labor in <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION> now strongly supports the ending of the
sanctions, the department said.
   Military aid and arms sales to <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION> have been restricted since
<DATE>1976</DATE>. The department noted <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> law bars their restoration until
the Chilean government meets these two conditions:
   _Restores respect for human rights.
   _Cooperates with the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> in bringing to justice those
Chilean intelligence officials suspected of complicity in the <DATE>1976</DATE>
murders in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> of former Chilean diplomat <PERSON>Orlando Letelier</PERSON>
and an American colleague, <PERSON>Ronni K. Moffitt</PERSON>.
   ``We are confident that the new government of <PERSON>Patricio Aylwin</PERSON>
will make every effort to meet those conditions,'' the department
statement said.

FT  07 SEP 93 / No easing of general's grip in 'free' Chile: The coming 20th
anniversary of Pinochet's coup
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID PILLING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE IS a little copper coin in <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>, the 10 peso piece, which depicts the
angel of liberty snapping the chains of repression that for so long have
bound her wrists. It does not commemorate <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>'s return to democracy in
<DATE>1990</DATE>, after 17 years of military rule, but the coup of <DATE>1973</DATE> that brought the
generals, led by <PERSON>Augusto Pinochet</PERSON>, to power.
As <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION> approaches the <DATE>20th anniversary of the coup of September 11</DATE>, the
coin remains a small but significant reminder of the fragile balance that
exists between the civilian government and the military forces. The
authority of the transitional administration, led by President <PERSON>Patricio
Aylwin</PERSON>, is still strictly circumscribed by the armed forces and by <PERSON>Gen
Pinochet</PERSON>'s <DATE>1980</DATE> constitution which remains largely intact.
Relations with the military, alternately civil and strained during the
democratic transition, have become tense over the past few months. The low
point was <DATE>May 28</DATE> when the military took advantage of President <PERSON>Aylwin</PERSON>'s
absence abroad to put on a show of strength on <LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION>'s streets. Troops
appeared in full combat gear, sporting automatic weapons and rocket
launchers, as the generals - still headed by <PERSON>Gen Pinochet</PERSON> - held a meeting.
The sabre-rattling of <DATE>May</DATE> was largely provoked by the one issue that has
dogged civilian-military relations since the <DATE>1990</DATE> handover - the matter of
human rights abuses committed during the military regime. Most leaders of
the armed forces believe that the issue has dragged on for too long. Many
still argue that during the <DATE>1970s</DATE> the military was engaged in a legitimate
war against Marxism, and that their actions should not be criticised.
Furthermore, since few, if any, torturers and assassins are to be punished -
because of an amnesty promulgated in <DATE>1978</DATE> - most in the military feel that
to pursue trials is a waste of time which can only further sully the armed
forces' reputation.
President <PERSON>Aylwin</PERSON>'s recent attempt to bring the trials to a conclusion ended
in disaster last week when divisions within the governing Concertacion
coalition killed off the president's bill. The so-called 'Aylwin Law',
presented to the nation in an emotional speech last month, had sought to
appoint special judges to hear human rights trials in secret. The hope was
largely to unearth fresh information that might have led to the discovery of
bodies 'disappeared' by the military.
The president was last week forced to halt the bill's progress through
<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> after parties within his own coalition voted against the secret
clause which they argued denied the nation its right to know. It seems clear
that, during months of discussions with <PERSON>Gen Pinochet</PERSON>, the president had
reached agreement with the military, but had not squared the deal within his
own government.
His retreat, seen in <LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION> as a personal political defeat, shows the
difficulty of trying to appease politicians and soldiers when they are
pulling in different directions.
The bickering within the Concertacion mirrors the no less public debate over
commemoration of the <DATE>20th anniversary of the 1973</DATE> coup, still a public
holiday after the government's failed attempt to shift it to a less
controversial day. The failure to do so in itself highlights the
restrictions imposed by the <DATE>1980</DATE> constitution which, among other things,
enabled <PERSON>Gen Pinochet</PERSON> to stack the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> with nine of his non-elected
supporters.
The Concertacion has insisted that the military not conduct its celebrations
within four blocks of the Moneda presidential palace, the building which was
bombed during the final stages of the <DATE>1973</DATE> coup that overthrew the left-wing
government of President <PERSON>Salvador Allende</PERSON>.
<PERSON>Mr Aylwin</PERSON> has called on the armed forces to show restraint and to remember
the families of those who suffered repression. He has also urged Chileans
not to organise demonstrations in favour of or against the coup, but instead
to strive for reconciliation.
Traditionally, government employees have demonstrated their disapproval of
the holiday by refusing to take the day off work. But this method of protest
has been denied them this year since <DATE>September 11 falls</DATE> on a <DATE>Saturday</DATE>. The
possibility of clashes between opponents and supporters of the coup remains,
in spite of the president's attempt to defuse matters.
Gen <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON> feels the nation has forgotten what he sees as the service
performed by the military in overthrowing <PERSON>Mr Allende</PERSON>'s Marxist government.
'Everybody in this country has forgotten,' he said in a recent speech. 'It
is as though a shadow of amnesia has passed over the minds of the people.'
He remains a combative defender of the new role carved out for the armed
forces under what has been called a 'protected democracy'. He cannot be
dismissed by the government and is guaranteed to remain commander in chief
until <DATE>1998</DATE>. The president also has no power to reduce the huge armed forces
budget which is inflation-proofed and supplemented by 10 per cent of the
state copper company's earnings.
<PERSON>Mr Eduardo Frei</PERSON>, the presidential candidate of the Concertacion almost
certain to win <DATE>December</DATE>'s general election, has pledged to tackle what he
regards as the military's excessive power. After the armed forces' recent
flexing of muscles, it seems his task will be far from easy.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The tall, slim man in the comfortable corner office on the ground floor of <ORGANIZATION>La 
Moneda</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>'s historical government house, has materialized there like a time 
traveler from long ago. His name, <PERSON>Edgardo Boeninger</PERSON>, has a familiar ring, 
echoing the faded urgency of bygone newscasts, resounding with the drama of 
past struggles for power. 
</P>
<P>
Seventeen years have passed since a military coup interrupted Chilean 
democracy, ejecting Boeninger and others from the nucleus of national life. 
Now, many have returned to the thick of things; their names reign once more in 
the headlines as they wield the trappings of office. 
</P>
<P>
Foremost among them, of course, is <PERSON>Patricio Aylwin</PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>Christian 
Democratic Party</ORGANIZATION> at the time of the <DATE>1973</DATE> coup and now <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>'s elected civilian 
president. Then there are former congressmen, former ministers, longtime party 
leaders and other figures from the past who are among the people Aylwin relies 
on to help run the revived democracy. 
</P>
<P>
By most accounts, the president relies on no one more than <PERSON>Boeninger</PERSON>, 65, whose 
official title is "minister secretary general of the presidency." A kind of 
right-hand man to <PERSON>Aylwin</PERSON>, he is a prime example of the political veteran who 
has bridged the gap of time and military rule to assume a key position in the 
new democratic order. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, <PERSON>Boeninger</PERSON> played a major role in formulating the political strategy 
that carried the country through a remarkably smooth transition from military 
to civilian rule. In his ministerial position, he is a combination chief of 
staff, strategist, trouble-shooter and mediator whose intellectual prowess is 
sometimes said to make him indispensable to the president. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no doubt in my mind that he is the closest adviser and the one the 
president pays most attention to," said an opposition politician. 
</P>
<P>
"Aylwin would not be viable without Boeninger," commented another politician 
who has known both men for many years. 
</P>
<P>
Chileans recall other, more turbulent times when <PERSON>Boeninger</PERSON>'s formidable 
political skills were in play. In <DATE>1973</DATE>, before the coup, the chants of marching 
youths and clouds of tear gas often rose over <LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION> streets as rival 
political parties contended for power at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Chile</ORGANIZATION>. Boeninger was 
at the center of the fray as the university's elected rector. 
</P>
<P>
With the support of conservative parties and center-straddling Christian 
Democrats, he had won university elections three times in the previous four 
years, defeating leftist forces that supported Chilean President <PERSON>Salvador 
Allende</PERSON>, a socialist. 
</P>
<P>
Asked in a recent interview if he was against the coup on <DATE>Sept. 11, 1973</DATE>, 
<PERSON>Boeninger</PERSON> said he "shared the feeling that the situation had come to a point of 
crisis beyond return" but favored another solution. "We were working on the 
proposal that both the president and <ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION> resign, to have elections all 
over again, to start from scratch." 
</P>
<P>
Although <PERSON>Boeninger</PERSON> was deeply involved in the political process at the time, he 
did not belong to a party. After the coup, he joined the Christian Democrats, 
just as the military junta, led by army Gen. <PERSON>Augusto Pinochet</PERSON>, banned all 
parties. 
</P>
<P>
"I was the last man to be admitted into a political party," <PERSON>Boeninger</PERSON> recalled. 
"I requested the president of the party at the time, which precisely was 
<PERSON>Patricio Aylwin</PERSON>, to admit me into the party. . . . It was my way of protesting 
the shutting down of the political system by the military." 
</P>
<P>
When the new regime intervened in the university administration, <PERSON>Boeninger</PERSON> 
resigned his post as rector, abruptly ending that phase of his career in public 
service. 
</P>
<P>
Like a number of prominent Chileans, Boeninger comes from German stock. His 
father, a white-collar worker, immigrated to <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION> from <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> after World War 
I, and his mother was also of German descent. 
</P>
<P>
Boeninger attended some of <LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION>'s best secondary schools, then earned a 
degree in civil engineering at the <ORGANIZATION>Catholic University of Chile</ORGANIZATION>. He taught 
calculus and analytical geometry at the <ORGANIZATION>Catholic University School of 
Engineering</ORGANIZATION> for two years before serving for a decade as <LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION>'s first 
traffic engineer. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he completed a degree in business and economics at the <ORGANIZATION>University of 
Chile</ORGANIZATION>, where he became dean of economics in <DATE>1959</DATE>. Under President <PERSON>Eduardo Frei</PERSON>, 
from <DATE>1964</DATE> to <DATE>1969</DATE>, <PERSON>Boeninger</PERSON> was the national budget director. He was elected 
rector of the <ORGANIZATION>University of Chile</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1969</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
After the <DATE>1973</DATE> coup, he worked as a consultant to international organizations 
such as the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>World Bank</ORGANIZATION>. In <DATE>1975</DATE>, he spent half a year at 
<ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION> teaching a seminar and studying political science. 
</P>
<P>
He continued to study social sciences at private Chilean research institutions, 
"trying to sort of bring together economic thinking and political thinking," he 
said. "And that got me gradually involved in, first of all, bridging the gap of 
people who had been on different sides of the fence in the previous political 
conflicts." 
</P>
<P>
As a Christian Democrat, <PERSON>Boeninger</PERSON> formed a close association with <PERSON>Patricio 
Aylwin</PERSON> and became a party vice president in <DATE>1987</DATE>. Boeninger is often credited 
with devising the formula for an intricate alliance between the Christian 
Democrats and other parties, including the socialists, that won the elections 
last <DATE>October</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Using a favorite engineering metaphor, he told The Times that his earlier work 
in think tanks with both leftists and conservatives had helped prepare him for 
his political role. 
</P>
<P>
"I had helped build the initial bridges, so it was easy for me to make a 
contribution in doing this same bridge-building thing now in the political 
field," he said. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Genaro Arriagada</PERSON>, a vice president of the <ORGANIZATION>Christian Democratic Party</ORGANIZATION>, said it 
was also Boeninger's strategy that won struggles within the party and within 
the electoral alliance to give Aylwin the nomination. 
</P>
<P>
"The mastermind of that was Boeninger," said <PERSON>Arriagada</PERSON>. As a result, he said, 
<PERSON>Boeninger</PERSON> took his pick of posts in the administration that began <DATE>March 11</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
"He is perhaps the only Aylwin minister who could choose for himself where he 
would be," <PERSON>Arriagada</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
He called Boeninger "profoundly analytical, rational" and "morally impeccable," 
capable of resisting pressure but bent on avoiding conflicts that could 
jeopardize the democratic process. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Miguel Otero</PERSON>, a vice president of the conservative <ORGANIZATION>National Renovation Party</ORGANIZATION>, 
described Boeninger as "muy simpatico," but calculatedly so. 
</P>
<P>
"Boeninger never loses his calm, never," <PERSON>Otero</PERSON> said. "He knows exactly where he 
is going and how, and he uses all of the charm in his power to get there." 
</P>
<P>
Boeninger said an important part of his job is to mediate between parties and 
the government, between the <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> and the government and between ministries 
within the government. On a bookshelf, within his reach as he spoke in his La 
Moneda office, was a book entitled "The Resolution of Conflict." 
</P>
<P>
Boeninger is a voluminous reader. "I read all sorts of novels," he said. Once 
he favored authors of <LOCATION>Latin America</LOCATION>'s literary "boom" generation of the <DATE>1960s</DATE>, 
such as <PERSON>Gabriel Garcia Marquez</PERSON>, but lately he has been exploring Japanese and 
Egyptian literature, he said. 
</P>
<P>
He also relaxes with jogging and <ORGANIZATION>Ping-Pong</ORGANIZATION>. "I'm fond of the theater, I'm fond 
of the movies, I like to dance," he added. "I've never been bored in my life. 
Too many things interest me." 
</P>
<P>
He and his wife, <PERSON>Marta</PERSON>, have been married 22 years. He has two grown children 
from a previous marriage and she has four. 
</P>
<P>
Boeninger makes a distinction between his political and private lives. "His 
house is not the politician's house where everyone comes," said Christian 
Democrat Arriagada. "His friends come, and that's it." 
</P>
<P>
What Boeninger does most, however, is work, according to those who know him. He 
is capable, according to the newsmagazine Hoy, "of working until 2 in the 
<TIME>morning</TIME> and returning to work at <TIME>8 a.m.</TIME> with a memo ready containing a proposal 
for solving the problem under discussion." 
</P>
<P>
A major problem faced by the administration Boeninger serves is what to do 
about human rights violations that took place under <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON>'s military 
government. Many Chileans want punishment for violators, but others, including 
<PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON>, oppose it. 
</P>
<P>
"The issue of human rights is the only one in which you cannot expect to reach 
a consensus," <PERSON>Boeninger</PERSON> said. "What you can do is ride a narrow path to finally 
get to what I call the grudging acceptance of all the parties involved. 
</P>
<P>
"What does that really mean? That the expectations of punishment for violators 
of human rights will be limited. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
He said Chileans will have to accept a small number of human rights trials for 
crimes that took place after <DATE>1978</DATE>. Violations before that are pardoned by an 
amnesty, decreed under <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON>'s regime. 
</P>
<P>
"We will not try to change the amnesty law," <PERSON>Boeninger</PERSON> said. "We think that 
would produce a conflict hardly manageable." 
</P>
<P>
Boeninger predicted that the armed forces will not interfere with the 
government's overriding goal of consolidating democracy. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that the authoritarian temptation is any risk now in this 
country," he said. "I don't think that anyone believes that there could be a 
regression to any kind of authoritarian regime." 
</P>
<P>
When the current four-year term is over, <PERSON>Boeninger</PERSON> will end his public service 
career and do some writing, he said. "I plan to try to write my vision of the 
events of <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION> from <DATE>1973</DATE> to <DATE>1993</DATE>."

<TEXT>
   Thousands of leftists battled police
<DATE>Sunday</DATE> after an emotional memorial service to Marxist President
<PERSON>Salvador Allende</PERSON>, who perished in the military coup that overthrew
his government 15 years ago.
   An estimated 5,000 people paid homage at the modest tomb in a
cemetery in this coastal resort.
   When the service ended bands of militants marched out of the
cemetery and were confronted by ranks of helmeted riot police. The
police used tear gas, clubs and water cannons to disperse the
marchers.
   Several people were arrested and reporters saw a few
demonstrators injured, including a young man bleeding from the head
after being clubbed by two policemen. Officials did not give any
figures on the numbers of arrests or injured.
   It was the largest graveside tribute to Allende who was buried
in the suburban cemetery a day after his death during the <DATE>Sept. 11,
1973</DATE>, coup led by Gen. <PERSON>Augusto Pinochet</PERSON>, the army commander who
then became president.
   The regional government in <PERSON>Vina del Mar</PERSON>, 75 miles northwest of
<LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION>, had authorized only a brief procession and when the
militants attemped to march on the city center the police blocked
them.
   According to the military government, Allende shot himself in
the head with a carbine that was a gift from Cuban President <PERSON>Fidel
Castro</PERSON> as the Presidential Palace was in flames and under attack by
troops. Allende had declared he would not allow himself to be
deposed and taken out of the palace alive, and the military version
is accepted by most Chileans and historians.
   But his followers said after the coup he was killed by police or
soldiers who shot their way into his office.
   The military government had barred the placing of a tombstone
with <ORGANIZATION>Allende</ORGANIZATION>'s name at the grave, but on <DATE>Sunday</DATE> there was a small
marble plaque with the inscription: ``<PERSON>Salvador Allende Gossens</PERSON>,
<DATE>June 26, 1908</DATE> _ <DATE>September 11, 1973</DATE>. President of <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>, 1970-1073.
Tribute of the Chilean Socialist Party.''
   Groups of people began arriving at the cemetery in midmorning,
many placing red and white carnations at the tomb. By noon, some
5,000 people had gathered and a carpet of carnations covered the
tomb.
   A man in his 20s stood beside the tomb for a few minutes and
then collapsed, sobbing. Many other mourners also wept.
   The crowd was quiet as loudspeakers broadcast a recording of
Allende's last speech on the day of the coup.
   ``You don't stop social processes with crime or by force,'' he
said, speaking through by telephone from the besieged palace to the
only <LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION> radio station that not been taken over by the
military. Gunfire and explosions could be heard in the background.
   After the recording people in the crowd chanted, ``We can feel
it, we can feel it, Allende is here.''
   They also shouted, ``Pinochet is going to fall, the dictatorship
is going to fall.''
   Attending the service were a grandson of <LOCATION>Allende</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Gonzalo Meza</PERSON>,
and a niece, <PERSON>Denise Pascal</PERSON>. But <PERSON>Allende</PERSON>'s daughter, <PERSON>Isabel</PERSON>, who
returned to <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION> <DATE>Sept. 1</DATE> when the government ended the official
exile of about 500 leftists, was not present. She had visited the
grave privately <DATE>last week</DATE> and on <DATE>Saturday</DATE>.

<TEXT>
   Gen. <PERSON>Augusto Pinochet</PERSON> surrendered the
government to elected President <PERSON>Patricio Aylwin</PERSON> on <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, ending
16{ years of military rule and completing <LOCATION>South America</LOCATION>'s
transition to civilian government.
   However, <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON> remains chief of the 60,000-member army,
despite a request from <PERSON>Aylwin</PERSON> that he give up that powerful post.
   Street celebrations of the partial return of democracy touched
off scattered disturbances in downtown <LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION>. Bands of leftist
youths blocked streets with burning debris and clashed with police.
More than 20 people were reported injured.
   To thunderous applause and cheers, <PERSON>Aylwin</PERSON> put on the red, white
and blue presidential sash in the inaugural ceremony in <LOCATION>Valparaiso</LOCATION>,
a seaport city 70 miles northwest of <LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION>.
   ``<LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION> returns to democracy without violence, without blood,
without hate,'' he later told supporters in <LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION>. ``<LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>
returns by the road of peace.''
   Aylwin's first official act was to pardon all political
prisoners under the <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON> regime.
   Pinochet shook the new president's hand at the inauguration and
then quickly left the hall, where his entrance brought competing
chants of ``Pinochet! Pinochet!'' and ``Murderer! Murderer!'' from
the galleries.
   Upon the 74-year-old <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> general's arrival for the ceremony, a
group of protesters tossed tomatoes, stones and other objects at
<LOCATION>Pinochet</LOCATION>'s open-top limosine and shouted insults.
   The car, surrounded by military bodyguards, momentarily sped up.
It bumped into a soldier on horseback, but no injuries were
reported.
   A military band saluted <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON> as he left the ceremony, held
in a half-finished congressional palace being built to house an
elected senate and house of deputies, which also assumed power
<DATE>Sunday</DATE>. Under <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON>, a military junta had acted as the
legislature.
   Aylwin, a 71-year-old centrist politician, won elections in
<DATE>December</DATE>. A Christian Democrat, he is backed by a coalition of 17
centrist and leftist parties.
   He has vowed to restore respect for human rights and civil
liberties and put more emphasis on social services for the poor.
But he plans no major changes in <LOCATION>Pinochet</LOCATION>'s largely successful
free-market economic program.
   <DATE>Sunday</DATE> <TIME>evening</TIME>, <PERSON>Aylwin</PERSON> stood on the balcony of the presidential
palace in <LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION> and urged Chileans to put aside differences and
unite behind democracy.
   Hundreds of thousands of jubilant Chileans lined the route into
<LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION> from <LOCATION>Valparaiso</LOCATION> to cheer <PERSON>Aylwin</PERSON>'s motorcade. They packed
the square in front of the presidential palace, waving banners and
chanting anti-Pinochet slogans.
   Just before <PERSON>Aylwin</PERSON> spoke, some celebrants broke through a police
line beside the palace, and police scattered them with tear gas.
First-aid workers at a nearby hotel treated three people
overwhelmed by the gas and one man who was bleeding from the head,
according to witnesses.
   As evening approached, people clashed with police up and down
the capital's main boulevard. Authorities used tear gas and water
cannons.
   Several people were seen bleeding or otherwise hurt, and local
radio stations reported about 20 people injured. Police hauled off
some protesters, but a police spokesman said he had no total for
arrests.
   Pinochet was obliged to call the election when voters, in a <DATE>1988</DATE>
referendum, rejected an extension of his rule to <DATE>1997</DATE>.
   A clause in the <DATE>1980</DATE> constitution, written by <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON>'s
administration, bars any new president from replacing him as army
commander before <DATE>1998</DATE>. Aylwin's term ends in <DATE>1994</DATE>.
   Pinochet seized power in a bloody <DATE>1973</DATE> coup, ending a long
democratic tradition in <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>. He toppled the elected government of
President <PERSON>Salvador Allende</PERSON>, an avowed Marxist, during a period of
economic and social turmoil.
   The general began his last morning as president by receiving
Vice President <PERSON>Dan Quayle</PERSON> at his home in eastern <LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION> for a
30-minute private meeting.
   Pinochet supporters outside booed and jeered <PERSON>Quayle</PERSON>. ``Gringo,
understand, <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION> isn't for sale,'' some chanted. Others held up
signs saying, ``Go Home.''
   Pinochet has bitterly criticized the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> for
supporting the push for democracy in <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION> and for cutting off
weapons sales to <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION> in <DATE>1976</DATE> because of systematic human rights
violations.
   The arms embargo was proposed by <PERSON>Sen. Edward M. Kennedy</PERSON>,
<LOCATION>D-Mass.</LOCATION>, who came to <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION> with <PERSON>Quayle</PERSON> and attended the
inauguration. The embargo remains in effect.
   ``This is the dawn of a new era,'' <PERSON>Quayle</PERSON> said in <LOCATION>Valparaiso</LOCATION>.
``Democracy is here. We hope it is here to stay.''
   ``I'm proud of what the Chilean people have done,'' <PERSON>Kennedy</PERSON> said.
   <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION> is the last in a series of South American countries to
restore elected civilian rule in the <DATE>last decade</DATE>, ending the
dominance of authoritarian military leaders.
   Also in <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION> for the inauguration was <PERSON>Joyce Horman</PERSON>, the widow
of <PERSON>Charles Horman</PERSON>. He was an American free-lance journalist whose
arrest and slaying during the <DATE>1973</DATE> coup inspired the movie
``Missing.''
   According to the family and testimony collected by human rights
groups, <PERSON>Horman</PERSON> was among many suspected dissidents held and
executed at <LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>National Stadium</ORGANIZATION>. The military government
has denied the allegations.
   <PERSON>Mrs. Horman</PERSON> of <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> was invited by the new government and
was expected to attend several events surrounding the inauguration.
   In his first act as president, <PERSON>Aylwin</PERSON> decreed a pardon for all
``prisoners of conscience'' jailed by the <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON> government.
   About 450 people are imprisoned for politically related crimes,
although most are charged in connection with guerrilla activity.
Aylwin has said he opposes freeing anyone guilty of blood crimes,
and it was not immediately clear whom the pardon would affect.
   As the change in government was taking place, many foreign heads
of state were arriving _ having delayed their visits until
<PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON>'s rule was formally ended. They included presidents <PERSON>Carlos
Andres Perez</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Daniel Ortega</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Nicaragua</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Alan Garcia</PERSON>
of <LOCATION>Peru</LOCATION>, and prime ministers <PERSON>Felipe Gonzalez</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Giulio
Andreotii</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>.
   In <LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION>, thousands of Pinochet supporters lined a two-mile
stretch to bid him farewell before he attended a final military
mass and flew off to the <LOCATION>Valparaiso</LOCATION> ceremony.
   ``You will return,'' many chanted. Some wept openly. The crowds
repeatedly surged through police lines trying to touch the general,
who was in an open car.
   The crowd grabbed and punched reporters accompanying <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON>,
who repeatedly has accused the press of unfairly attacking his rule
and exaggerating human rights abuses.
   In <LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION>, small bombs were tossed from moving taxis at or
near the homes of three military officers, police said. Only minor
damage was reported, and no one claimed responsibility for the
attacks.
   Leftist extremist groups have operated in <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION> for years, but
it is widely speculated that many of the attacks attributed to them
are carried out by right-wing organizations trying to dramatize the
leftist threat.

   Many Chileans Still Lured by Statists' Siren Song

   SANTIAGO -- That populism in Chile still exists is
understandable. But that the textile sector should become the
stage for populism's latest appearance is downright ironic.
Textiles were among those industries that, according to
free-market economist Joaquin Lavin, most clearly reflected
the modernizing effects of the Pinochet dictatorship's
liberal economic model. First published in 1987, Mr. Lavin's
book "La Revolucion Silenciosa" is an unconnected list of
showy examples presented as irrefutable proof that Chile was
finally joining the ranks of modernity.
   Unfortunately, events currently taking place in the
textile sector reveal Mr. Lavin overlooked an important
factor. To paraphrase another famous book title, modernity is
also a state of mind.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Denouncing foreign "dumping," management leaders of
<LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>'s textile sector already have asked the government for
protection. They argue the alternative is bankruptcy. But it
has been the reaction of <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>'s most important labor
organization, Unitary Worker's Central (CUT), that has raised
the most alarming memories of a populist past. It has called
on the state to intervene in the textile sector to protect
the thousands of jobs that would be lost in an eventual
collapse.
   The textile sector's problems might be a preamble to the
greatest economic challenge facing <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>'s new democracy: to
conciliate continued economic growth with an economic
consciousness still lured by the siren song of populism.
President <PERSON>Patricio Aylwin</PERSON>'s government has given every sign
that it understands the way to maintain this economic
performance is to conserve the main features of Gen. <PERSON>Augusto
Pincohet</PERSON>'s free-market model, a view that has found broad
consensus among <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>'s political elites. The problem is that
in a democracy what the elites think might not be enough.
CUT's opinions suggest a fundamental disagreement between the
working-class people it represents and the market-oriented
policies that now rule the Chilean economy.
   There is no question that under Gen. <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON>'s economic
model, <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION> took strides toward becoming a modern nation. In
<DATE>1974</DATE>, a customer going to an ALMAC (one of <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>'s oldest
supermarket chains) had 5,500 different products to choose
from; today ALMAC offers 16,000 items. In <DATE>1970</DATE>, two in 100
Chileans had a car; by <DATE>1985</DATE>, five in 100 did. Walking into
<LOCATION>Almacenes Paris</LOCATION> or Falabella in downtown <LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION> is like
walking into any major department store in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> or
<LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>: <PERSON>Paloma Picasso</PERSON> window displays, Arrow shirts, Swiss
army knives and <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> diskettes. On the streets of any Chilean
city, the youth wear jeans, ski parkas and sneakers.
   Faced with the choice, those who have tasted the benefits
of this open, world-oriented economy would rather never go
back to the statist model that dominated society until <DATE>1973</DATE>.
But there are others who are not yet better off than before.
   Different sources indicate the poor account for somewhere
between a third and a half of <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>'s population. An American
journalist friend who recently came with me to the
"poblaciones", as the suburban slums are known, described
them simply as "surreal." That cold night the dirt streets
were barely visible through the dense cloud of dust
reflecting this year's drought. Added on to the
state-supplied cement cabins were shanties made of cardboard
and plastic to accommodate the homeless's relatives, about a
million nationwide.
   When well-off people drive through these areas on their
way to the beach or to pick somebody up at the airport, few
imagine that the fetid organic smell that permeates the area
is an everyday reality for the hundreds of thousands of
"pobladores" who live there. The poblaciones are a world unto
their own. Even though the people there wear jeans and
sneakers, most spend their days trying to figure out how to
secure their next meal.
   These people don't earn enough to join one of the private
social-security or health-care companies, and what is left
for them instead are the ailing remnants of the old state-run
system. Three-day waits are common for those who want to set
up medical appointments, and patients often are asked to
bring their own medicine before they are admitted to
hospitals. City services aren't worse; they just aren't.
   Contrary to the widespread perception that economic
dependency on the state had been retreating during the
dictatorship years, for this other half it was the opposite.
A recent survey indicates that whereas in <DATE>1970</DATE>, <PERCENT>37%</PERCENT> of the
extremely poor relied on the government for all income, by
<DATE>1988</DATE> the new policy of subsidy "focalization" and the drop in
real wages had caused the state to account for <PERCENT>57%</PERCENT> of the
very poor's total income. Unwillingly, the dictatorship
created the conditions for populism to survive in the
mind-set of the poor; they have become a parallel and
anachronistic reality whose political expectations stand in
direct contrast to the Chileans who have joined the world
market.
   Pictures of <ORGANIZATION>Marxist President Salvador Allende</ORGANIZATION> are common
on the walls of many houses at the poblaciones. A robust
woman with a sad expression on her face told me, "We were
better off when he was our president. Poor man, he will
always be with us." Allende's memory is revered and his
protecting father-image lives on as testament to a mentality
that to this day sees state initiatives as the main hope for
improvement.
   The preference for a strong state is not limited to the
extremely poor, however. This view is still present in part
of the old middle class.
   Chileans say <LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION>, population four million, has more
taxicabs than <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION>. Middle-aged ex-accountants,
ex-bureaucrats and ex-administrators of state companies are
only a few among those one currently finds driving hacks. Now
they drive their taxicabs in a deregulated market, charging a
fare governed almost exclusively by what the market will
bear. "I wish the state would set the fares," says <PERSON>Alredo
Medina</PERSON>, a cab driver who used to be a municipal supervisor.
"This way, no one knows what to charge, and one has to go
around competing with other taxis." To him, this dynamic
society is puzzling and obscure. Consciously or not, looking
to the state for guidance and protection remains a cultural
trait for much of the middle class he represents.
   Many of those who voted for President <PERSON>Aylwin</PERSON> perceived him
as a continuation of the system that existed before the
military coup of <DATE>1973</DATE>, and this might be the essence of a
long-range problem. But <PERSON>Mr. Aylwin</PERSON>'s policies are far from
those of the long-dead Allende's, and many will be
disappointed once it becomes clear that his government plans
to restrict the growth of the state. So far the new
government has been on its honeymoon, but events like those
in the textile industry indicate that the honeymoon may be
coming to an end.
   Measures of the sort proposed by CUT have found little
echo among the established political forces. But the real
danger lies in the future. <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION> is now a democracy, and as
long as a populist view of the state remains alive within a
significant number of the voters, the system will remain
vulnerable to its influence.

<FP=106> [Address by President <PERSON>Eduardo Frei</PERSON> outside La Moneda Palace </F>
in <LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION> -- live] 
  [Text] Chileans: I want to start this brief speech by 
voicing my gratitude to all of those who have given me your 
support and affection, which I want and hope to return with my 
great dedication to the hopes of all our fellow countrymen, and 
especially the most modest, the have-nots. [applause] 
  Our government will take into account the dreams and 
ambitions of Chilean men, women, and children. I also want to 
greet those students who passed their university entry exams 
with flying colors, who are with us now as special guests. 
[applause] 
  We are aware of our responsibilities and the difficulties of 
the task we are undertaking today. But, as I have repeatedly 
stated during the recent presidential campaign, I firmly believe 
this generation can wipe out extreme poverty from our country; 
that we can renew and expand our infrastructure; that we will 
substantially increase the <ORGANIZATION>GDP</ORGANIZATION> and our exports, change the 
structure of our education system, grow in a sustained manner, 
improve the peoples' living standards, and solve the peoples' 
concrete problems. 
  After these four years of socioeconomic growth and 
restoration of democracy we have an excellent opportunity, which 
we will not miss. This is an equal opportunity for all Chileans. 
This afternoon I also want to greet President <PERSON>Patricio Aylwin</PERSON>, 
who has bequeathed us a great legacy from his years in 
government. [applause] 
  The new times have started. It is not just a plan; it is a 
new phase in Chilean development. We must reorganize government 
in face of all the changes we are currently witnessing; we need 
to implement changes in the distribution of political power at 
the district, regional, and national level; we must bring about 
changes in the relationship between the public and private 
sectors, and changes in the role we play in the international 
arena. In sum, this is the beginning of a new historical phase, 
which we know, now that it is starting, will conclude when each 
and every Chilean decides to make an effort for the well-being 
of all Chileans. [applause] 
  Tomorrow afternoon, here in Constitution Square, I will 
announce the style of my government. 
  The <ORGANIZATION>La Moneda Palace</ORGANIZATION> building, where I arrived today in my 
capacity as president of the Chilean people, is witness to the 
history of our institutions, the strength of their servants, and 
the righteousness of our politicians. 
  From this site I humbly ask God to keep us on this path of 
service and effort. 
  With faith in <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>, in its people, and its future, deeply 
moved and thankful, I greet you all. 
  The men who governed <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION> from here with effort, 
dedication, 
and love for the fatherland are responsible for the <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION> we 
have today. We will continue to work with national awareness. 
With your support and that of all Chileans, we are going to 
bring politics and the people and their daily problems together. 
We are going to work hard every day to be with you, to solve 
the daily problems of millions of Chileans, and we are going to 
do this observing the high moral and ethical political standards 
that are necessary for the times we are experiencing. [applause] 
  I urge the Chilean people and, through you, the millions and 
millions of Chileans that have given us their support, to help 
me, to help carry out this beautiful task of building a unified 
country. I urge them to accompany me in this beautiful task, 
because the task of building and dreaming of the future, the 
task of building and dreaming of a developed and unified country 
at the threshold of the <DATE>21st century</DATE>, is a task that concerns 
all Chileans. I am going to head this task, and with your 
support we will be successful; we are going to enter the <DATE>21st 
century</DATE> as a unified, progressive country in which each and 
every Chilean feels part of a human country, feels that he has 
an opportunity. Let us walk with confidence and optimism, with 
faith in <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>'s future. Let us go ahead. Long live <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>. 
[applause]

<HEAD>Chile Signs Agreement with U.S. to Pay Compensation on Letelier
Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EDUARDO GALLARDO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Chilean official said <DATE>Saturday</DATE> that his
government reached agreement with the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> to pay
compensation for the <DATE>1976</DATE> killing of a Chilean opposition figure
and a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> associate in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>.
   The ``agreement in principle'' came <DATE>Friday</DATE> in a meeting between
Chilean and <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> officials in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, said acting Interior
Minister <PERSON>Belisario Velasco</PERSON>.
   He gave few details on the agreement.
   <PERSON>Velasco</PERSON> said the payments would go to the families of <LOCATION>Orlando
Letelier</LOCATION>, a former Chilean foreign minister who fled to the <LOCATION>United
States</LOCATION> following a <DATE>1973</DATE> right-wing military coup, and <PERSON>Ronni
Moffitt</PERSON>, an aide to <ORGANIZATION>Letelier</ORGANIZATION> who also was killed when their car was
bombed in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>.
   ``In the next few days, a complete announcement with details
will be made,'' said <PERSON>Velasco</PERSON> in an interview. He said the matter
must now be taken to President <PERSON>Patricio Aylwin</PERSON>, a civilian who
replaced Gen. <PERSON>Augusto Pinochet</PERSON> in <DATE>March</DATE>.
   Pinochet led the <DATE>1973</DATE> overthrow of elected civilian President
<PERSON>Salvador Allende</PERSON>, and his military government had blocked efforts
by <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> courts and the government to seek compensation in the
killings.
   <PERSON>Velasco</PERSON> said the meeting in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> was between Deputy
Foreign Minister <PERSON>Edmundo Vargas</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>'s ambassador to the <LOCATION>United
States</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Patricio Silva</PERSON>, and three <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> officials _ Assistant
Secretary of State <PERSON>Bernard Aronson</PERSON>, <PERSON>Abraham Sofaer</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>State
Department</ORGANIZATION>'s legal adviser, and <PERSON>Charles Gillespie</PERSON>, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
ambassador to <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>.
   In <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>Mark Dillen</PERSON> said: ``I
can't confirm the agreement by the Chileans, but their deputy
foreign minister has been in town discussing bilaterial issues with
us and also meeting with the (<ORGANIZATION>Organization of American States</ORGANIZATION>).
   ``As of yesterday, what we were saying was that we're optimistic
our discussions would result in a satisfactory resolution to the
case.''
   The agreement was not expected to affect criminal cases in the
<LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> against former officials of Pinochet's secret police
indicted in the killings.
   Aylwin, who defeated a Pinochet-backed candidate in elections to
replace the military government, has promised full cooperation with
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> officials in the case.
   In <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>, the issue is seen as a key battle between <PERSON>Aylwin</PERSON> and
<PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON>, who remains as army commander and has promised to block
human rights investigations of the military.
   Letelier served as <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>'s ambassador to <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> and was
foreign minister during the Allende government. In exile following
the <DATE>1973</DATE> coup, he became a severe critic of <ORGANIZATION>Pinochet</ORGANIZATION>'s rule.
   At the time of the <DATE>Sept. 21, 1976</DATE>, Letelier and <PERSON>Ms. Moffitt</PERSON> were
working for the <ORGANIZATION>Institute for Policy Studies</ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
   Military President <PERSON>Augusto Pinochet</PERSON> wept
<DATE>Monday</DATE> during his last state-of-the nation address but declared he
still is prepared to take power again if necessary.
   His 88-minute speech, broadcast on national radio and television,
marked the 16th anniversary of the coup he led on <DATE>Sept. 11, 1973</DATE>,
that left hundreds dead. He is scheduled to surrender power to an
elected civilian government next <DATE>March</DATE>.
   As he spoke, riot police used water cannons and tear gas to
scatter scores of demonstrators trying to enter <LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>General
Cemetery</ORGANIZATION> to mourn the casualties of the anti-leftist repression that
followed the coup. There were no reports of arrests.
   But people were arrested during two anti-Pinochet demonstrations
in <LOCATION>Vina</LOCATION> del Mar and <LOCATION>Iquique</LOCATION>.
   The coup ousted the elected government of elected Marxist
President <PERSON>Salvador Allende</PERSON>, and <PERSON>Allende</PERSON> died during the final
assault on the presidential palace in central <LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION>.
   As in past years, several thousand people gathered to honor
Allende at his grave in the <LOCATION>Santa Ines Cemetery</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Vina del Mar</LOCATION>, 75
miles northwest of <LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION>.
   Police did not interfere with the ceremony but fired water
cannons and tear gas to scatter demonstrators who tried to march
downtown. Witnesses saw several marchers detained but police gave no
report.
   Radio Cooperativa reported about 100 people were detained during
disturbances in <LOCATION>Iquique</LOCATION>, 1,100 miles north of <LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION>. No other
information was available.
   There were conflicting reports about <ORGANIZATION>Allende</ORGANIZATION>'s death. Some
supporters said he was killed by troops who broke into his office. A
government report said he committed suicide with a carbine that was
a gift from Cuban President <PERSON>Fidel Castro</PERSON>.
   Pinochet, a 73-year-old general who commands the army, said in
his address the armed forces will not allow a civilian government to
bring back ``the demagogic policies'' that he said brought the coup.
   Wearing his army uniform with the white, red and blue
presidential sash, he said economic progress under his
administration has placed <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION> ``very close to the most advanced
nations.''
   Toward the end of his speech, with his voice breaking and his
eyes brimming with tears, he spoke of ``the unfair criticism'' he
has received and the attempt to kill him three years ago.
   ``In spite of all this, we would do it again if necessary, even
if we had to offer our own lives,'' he said.
   ``I love my motherland dearly, I love it more than I love my own
life,'' he added, weeping openly.
   Several thousand people lined <LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION>'s main boulevard to see
<PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON> ride in an open limousine for eight blocks from the
presidential palace to a government building to deliver his speech
in front of 3,000 government officials, military officers, diplomats
and special guests.
   Pinochet is to hand over the government on <DATE>March 11</DATE> to a
successor to be elected in balloting set for <DATE>Dec. 14</DATE>.
   Pinochet called the election after an <DATE>October 1988</DATE> referendum in
which voters rejected a military proposal to prolong his rule until
<DATE>1997</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Patricio Awlyin</PERSON>, 70, a former <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> president supported by a
coalition of 17 opposition parties, is favored to win the election.
   But <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON> will retain a substantial amount of power. The
constitution, written by his administration, allows him to remain as
army commander until <DATE>1998</DATE> and he has said he intends to do so.
   He made clear the military will keep a close eye on the new
government.
   He said the armed forces ``will not allow that our national
identity be deformed again and our sovereignty be subject to alien
ideologies.''
   Speaking of the coup, he said, ``If we hadn't taken power, <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>
would have suffered the tragic consequences of a civilian war,
encouraged by the (Allende) government itself.'' And since the coup,
he said, ``I have faced the biggest enemy of humanity _ Leninist
Marxism.''
   He announced a <PERCENT>12 percent</PERCENT> salary increase for all government
employees effective <DATE>Dec. 1</DATE> and said they will receive a <MONEY>$20</MONEY> bonus
this month on Chilean national day.

<HEAD>Burial in Chile's Capital For Allende, 17 Years After His Death</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The remains of former Marxist
President <PERSON>Salvador Allende</PERSON> are to be unearthed <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> from his
modest tomb in a resort city for re-burial in <LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION>, 17 years
after his death in a bloody military coup.
   The government of President <PERSON>Patricio Aylwin</PERSON>, a political foe of
<LOCATION>Allende</LOCATION>, has supported the plan to move <ORGANIZATION>Allende</ORGANIZATION>'s remains to the
capital. But right-wing politicians are bitterly criticizing it,
reviving the controversy over <LOCATION>Allende</LOCATION>'s three-year government.
   <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, the day of the burial and ceremony, marks the 20th
anniversary of the day Allende became the first Marxist freely
elected president in a Western country.
   Three years later, <PERSON>Allende</PERSON> was toppled by Gen. <PERSON>Augusto Pinochet</PERSON>,
whom he had named army commander. Allende died during in an attack
on his presidential palace on <DATE>Sept. 11, 1973</DATE>, during the coup led
by <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON>.
   Allende, who according the military committed suicide rather
than surrender, was buried the day after the coup in a modest
family tomb in <LOCATION>Vina del Mar</LOCATION>, 75 miles northwest of <LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION>.
   Hundreds of people visited the tomb <DATE>Saturday</DATE> and <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, placing
a thick carpet of red carnations on it as police with automatic
weapons stood guard.
   During <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON>'s 16{-year rule, the tomb remained unmarked.
When supporters of the former president placed a plaque indicating
he was buried there, it was quickly removed by authorities.
   After the <LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION> ceremonies, <ORGANIZATION>Allende</ORGANIZATION>'s remains will be buried
at a mausoleum in the capital's main cemetery, where other former
presidents and Chilean dignitaries are buried.

replied, "What a great saving." And when informed that the digging had
uncovered the remains of <PERSON>Juan Bautista van Schouwen</PERSON>, the founder of a radical
party, the Revolutionary Movement of the Left, the general said, "I
congratulate the diggers.";   The statements heightened tensions between the
Chilean army, of which <ORGANIZATION>Pinochet</ORGANIZATION> is still commander in chief, and the elected
government of President <PERSON>Patricio Aylwin.</PERSON>;   "The government is shocked by the
cruel remarks of General <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON>," said <PERSON>Enrique Correa</PERSON>, the government's
chief spokesman. "These cruel remarks offend the feelings of the relatives and
of the country as a whole.";   All the sets of remains recovered have bullet
holes in skulls and clothing. Many arms and legs have been broken, implying
torture. One victim was shot 35 times.;   Though Pinochet recently has said he
was not aware of the large number of "disappeared persons," as these victims
are referred to in this country and elsewhere in <LOCATION>Latin America</LOCATION>, family members
still place most of the blame on him.;   "He wants you to believe he is a fine
man, a good guy, while we all know he was the No. 1 assassin in the country,"
said <PERSON>Sola Sierra</PERSON>, president of an association of families of those missing or
arrested.;   Daily, family members -- almost all women -- come to the
cemetery. They weave dozens of carnations into the fence put up to keep the
public away from the digging site and hold quiet vigils. Many say they have
been searching for almost 18 years.  </TEXT>

are jailed.
   <DATE>Dec. 17, 1974</DATE> _ Pinochet assumes the office of president. Under
his rule, congress is suspended under a state of siege. A crackdown

government a worldwide reputation for human rights abuses.
   <DATE>Sept. 11, 1980</DATE> _ Voters approve a constitution providing for a

centrists and moderates.

<FP=106> [Interview with President-elect <PERSON>Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle</PERSON> by </F>
"24 Horas" program anchorman <PERSON>Bernardo de la Maza</PERSON> at the 
<ORGANIZATION>Television Nacional de Chile</ORGANIZATION> studios on 9 <DATE>March</DATE> -- live or 
recorded] 
  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] [De la Maza] The <ORGANIZATION>Codelco</ORGANIZATION> 
[Copper Corporation] case has undoubtedly tarnished the last 
days of President <PERSON>Aylwin</PERSON>'s administration. Will it influence 
the start of yours? 
  [Frei] It is a national problem. It does not involve an 
administration, it involves our country and it must be solved. 
  Apart from the proceedings to resolve this case -- which are 
being handled by the courts, the office of the comptroller 
general, the state defense council, and the Chamber of Deputies 
-- the country is interested in our future actions. 
  We want to establish a very strong modernization process. We 
have already begun by not appointing an executive vice 
president: Each managing director will be responsible for his 
area. 
  When formed, we will announce the new board of directors. We 
will announce it when the new <ORGANIZATION>Codelco</ORGANIZATION> executive officers are 
appointed. We will very strongly encourage the modernization of 
this company, which is a key company in the country. 
  [De la Maza] When one views what happened in <ORGANIZATION>Codelco</ORGANIZATION>, one 
believes it maybe is without solution. It apparently involves a 
man who -- acting wrongly -- took the money of Chileans and -- 
in a nutshell -- speculated on the international markets and 
lost more than <MONEY>$200 million</MONEY> in just a few weeks. What can be 
done to prevent this type of action? 
  [Frei] I believe there must be a control system. Every 
company in the world ... [changes thought] I am also an 
entrepreneur, I have worked for many years in private companies. 
There was no control. We must find out why there was no 
control. 
  Within the modernization process, we must clearly establish 
responsibilities and ensure that control is applied every day. 
  [De la Maza] It has been said recently that no one will pay 
for this loss, that Chileans will not have to pay it because 
there was some reserve money. Do you agree? 
  [Frei] If <ORGANIZATION>Codelco</ORGANIZATION> receives less money in the next few years 
as future transactions are completed, it is obvious that <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION> 
will receive less money. 
  [De la Maza] So all Chileans will have to pay for this loss 
in some way. 
  [Frei] Exactly. 
  [De la Maza] It has also been said that the <ORGANIZATION>Codelco</ORGANIZATION> case 
negated the idea of loyal and constructive opposition to the 
administration of President <PERSON>Patricio Aylwin</PERSON>. Do you agree? 
  [Frei] I do not. I have spoken with members of the 
opposition. I invited the presidents of the two main opposition 
parties, <PERSON>Andres Allamand</PERSON> [<ORGANIZATION>National Renewal</ORGANIZATION>] and <PERSON>Jovino Novoa</PERSON> 
[Independent Democratic Union], to dine at my house. We met 
when I was elected president. We will work together because I 
believe a president must deal with national issues and should 
always seek agreement on national issues. We may have different 
view points and disagreements, but there are national issues 
with which we must deal. As president I will deal with them 
from the national point of view. Regarding the opposition, I 
would like it to be loyal and constructive; an opposition that 
states its differences. In a democratic system it is good to 
have a rotation of governments, opposition, and control; and 
that is the task of the opposition. 
  [De la Maza] Do you expect disloyal opposition over the 
<ORGANIZATION>Codelco</ORGANIZATION> case? 
  [Frei] No. Of course, in a process as complex as the <ORGANIZATION>Codelco</ORGANIZATION> 
case some people may make inappropriate comments. This is part 
of our popular tradition but I believe the investigation must 
continue. 
  [De la Maza] As of next <DATE>Monday</DATE> you will be the president in 
<ORGANIZATION>La Moneda Palace</ORGANIZATION>. Among the measures you will be unable to 
adopt is that of removing the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> commander [General <PERSON>Augusto 
Pinochet</PERSON>]. As a democrat how do you feel, faced with this 
situation? 
  [Frei] From the point of view of principles -- as I have 
always said -- I would like the president to have that right. 
But I respect the Constitution and the laws because this is a 
process we started in <DATE>1988</DATE>. We will continue it because , as we 
always said, this is how we would do it, this is how we did it, 
and this is one of the successful aspects of the transition. 
  [De la Maza] Will you suggest to General <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON> that he 
leave the <ORGANIZATION>Army Command</ORGANIZATION>? 
  [Frei] He has the constitutional right to remain in his post 
until <DATE>1997</DATE>. As of 11 <DATE>March</DATE>, following my inauguration, ours 
will be a relationship appropriate between the president of the 
Republic and the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> commander. 
  [De la Maza] The fact that this situation continues -- a 
situation that does not fully coincide with a democratic regime, 
along with the situation of appointed senators, etc. -- do you 
believe the transition is not fully completed? 
  [Frei] I believe -- as pointed out in the <DATE>1989</DATE> program -- 
that some tasks were established for the transition and some 
were established for the next government. Some were not 
fulfilled, but we hope to fulfill them during my administration, 
including those mentioned. These tasks should be fulfilled 
within a framework of agreement, because under those conditions 
laws and agreements are permanent and no government will attempt 
to change them. We will work on those tasks under that spirit. 
  [De la Maza] Regarding this and other political reforms, 
such 
as the electoral law, do you like to move fast or slow? 
  [Frei] In the appropriate manner because the people are 
waiting to see how we will solve their real problems, how we 
will work on issues such as poverty, education, health, 
environment, and social security -- the big issues. 
  [De la Maza] Will you move faster on those issues? 
  [Frei] These issues will have priority. This does not mean 
we will forget other issues. Every issue will be dealt with at 
the appropriate time. On 21 <DATE>May</DATE> [opening of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>] I will 
clearly point this out. 
  [De la Maza] How can the people interpret your decision to 
appoint a socialist as interior minister? 
  [Frei] I would say this shows the full consolidation of 
democracy and that nothing is prohibited for any Chilean. 
  [De la Maza] As a former businessman -- you are known as a 
businessman -- do you believe capitalism is cruel to the poor. 
  [Frei] Obviously, and this is what we have been trying to 
change in this country. In only a few countries has it been 
shown that accelerated development is compatible with social 
justice and equity. This is what we have been working on during 
the last few years. We need investments and efficiency to 
overcome poverty, but we also need a real effort because, as I 
have said many times in the interior, many Chileans live in 
conditions similar to the most developed countries in the world, 
while near us many live in misery. From the point of view of 
ethics and solidarity, I believe we can and should make an 
effort. My government will make an effort. 
  [De la Maza] President <PERSON>Aylwin</PERSON> provided aid, will you 
increase 
it or do you feel it is sufficient? 
  [Frei] I believe we can increase it because the country is 
in 
a different condition than when <PERSON>Aylwin</PERSON> received the government 
in <DATE>1989</DATE>. Agreement has been reached on taxes which allows to 
spend more on social issues. I will also propose from the 
beginning of my administration -- perhaps make it the number one 
priority of my government -- that the struggle against poverty 
should be a national issue, not just for the government but for 
all sectors of the country. We will invite all sectors -- 
workers and businessmen -- to a great national crusade against 
poverty. In my speech on 12 <DATE>March</DATE>, I will announce that I will 
preside over the ministers social committee, emphasizing from 
the beginning the priority issues of our administration.

<HEAD>Widow of Marxist President Visits His Unmarked Grave</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN NOBLET</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VINA DEL MAR, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The widow of Salvador Allende visited
the president's unmarked grave <DATE>Monday</DATE> after returning from 15
years' forced exile, and tearfully thanked those who tended the
site in her absence.
   <ORGANIZATION>Hortensia Bussi de Allende</ORGANIZATION> made the 75-mile trip from <LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION>,
the capital, to the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> coastal resort town of <PERSON>Vina</PERSON> del Mar
with her two daughters, <PERSON>Isabel</PERSON> and <PERSON>Carmen</PERSON>, and a grandson, <PERSON>Gonzalo</PERSON>.
   <PERSON>Mrs. Allende</PERSON>, 74, spent a few minutes in silence before the
gravestone, which carried only the name of a sister, <ORGANIZATION>Ines</ORGANIZATION>, and a
brother-in-law. A recently-placed plaque bearing Allende's name had
been removed.
   She brought a bouquet of red carnations and left them atop the
tomb.
   About two dozen sympathizers, most of them working-class women,
embraced <PERSON>Mrs. Allende</PERSON> at the hillside cemetery. Many said they
regularly tended to the gravesite.
   The widow, brushing back tears, told the women, ``I thank all of
you for your faithfulness.''
   ``Faithful to the death,'' several women answered.
   On a concrete walkway in front of the tomb, supporters had
written in red paint: ``Allende Lives On In The People.''
   <PERSON>Mrs. Allende</PERSON> returned to <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION> <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, 24 days after
right-wing President <PERSON>Augusto Pinochet</PERSON> announced an end to all
official exile. The measure affected 504 leftists, including <PERSON>Mrs.
Allende</PERSON> and her children.
   Allende died on <DATE>Sept. 11, 1973</DATE>, during a coup led by Gen.
<PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON> that toppled the elected leftist government. According to
the military, Allende shot himself with a machine gun at the
presidential palace, which was rocketed by air force fighter jets.
The version is widely accepted by historians and even many <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON>
critics. Allende, a Marxist, had said he would never surrender or
allow himself to be captured.
   A day later, he was buried in <ORGANIZATION>Vina del Mar</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>Mrs. Allende</PERSON> was
flown by the military to attend the ceremony. She and her children
then sought refuge in the <ORGANIZATION>Mexican Embassy</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION> and left the
country.
   <PERSON>Mrs. Allende</PERSON> was not active in her husband's government but
after his death became a symbol of political repression by the new
military government. She became an outspoken critic of <LOCATION>Pinochet</LOCATION>,
and upon her return said she would support efforts to defeat him in
an <DATE>Oct. 5</DATE> presidential plebiscite.
   If a majority votes yes in the ballot, <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON> will remain in
power until <DATE>1997</DATE>. If most vote no, an open election will be held
next year and he must hand power over to the winner in <DATE>1990</DATE>.

Vice President <PERSON>Dan Quayle</PERSON>, bidding farewell to the last dictator on the <ORGANIZATION>South 
American Continent</ORGANIZATION>, said <DATE>Sunday</DATE> after meeting with Gen. <PERSON>Augusto Pinochet</PERSON> that 
after 16 years of strongman rule, the Chilean leader's place in history will be 
judged by his decision to turn the government over to a democratically elected 
president. 
</P>
<P>
For his part, <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON> equated the bloody coup in <DATE>1973</DATE>, in which the armed 
forces and police overthrew the Marxist-led government of President <PERSON>Salvador 
Allende</PERSON>, with the democratic revolutions that have rocked <LOCATION>Eastern Europe</LOCATION>. 
Pinochet told <PERSON>Quayle</PERSON>: 
</P>
<P>
"We weren't understood. What is happening with the <LOCATION>Berlin</LOCATION> Wall, <LOCATION>East Berlin</LOCATION>, 
<LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> -- that happened to us here 16 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
Quayle's day in <LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION>, the capital, and in <LOCATION>Valparaiso</LOCATION>, now the seat of 
<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> where <PERSON>Patricio Aylwin</PERSON> was inaugurated as president, presented a sharp 
contrast with his political life at home. 
</P>
<P>
A conservative crowd of several hundred <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON> supporters jeered him -- as a 
representative of a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> government that has been pressing for a return to 
democracy in <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION> -- when he arrived at <LOCATION>Pinochet</LOCATION>'s residence. The 
well-appointed crowd -- some members wore jewelry, and <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> Walkman headphones 
were in evidence -- shouted obscenities at him. 
</P>
<P>
At home, <PERSON>Quayle</PERSON> generally is applauded by conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
As he drove to <PERSON>Aylwin</PERSON>'s inauguration -- his main reason for visiting <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION> -- 
<PERSON>Quayle</PERSON> stopped to shake hands at a street corner in a working-class 
neighborhood where the new president's supporters flocked around the visiting 
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> politician and applauded. 
</P>
<P>
The visit to <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION> has posed something of a dilemma for the <ORGANIZATION>Bush 
Administration</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Although it is a celebration of democracy and harmony -- <PERSON>Sen. Edward M. Kennedy</PERSON> 
(D-Mass.), one of the most outspoken congressional critics of the <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON> 
regime, accompanied <PERSON>Quayle</PERSON> -- it has also called attention to the coup that 
brought <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON> to power and to reports at the time of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> support for the 
coup.

   Military President <PERSON>Augusto Pinochet</PERSON> lost
a referendum that would have allowed him to stay in power until
<DATE>1997</DATE>, government and opposition returns showed <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   The defeat sets the stage for open elections next year.
   In a speech broadcast nationwide on television and radio,
Interior Minister <PERSON>Sergio Fernandez</PERSON>, formally conceded <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON>'s
defeat at <TIME>2:40 a.m.</TIME> (<TIME>1:40 a.m. EDT</TIME>).
   ``We abide by the results, which the country already knows,''
<PERSON>Fernandez</PERSON> said.
   Earlier, <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> Commander General <PERSON>Fernando Matthei</PERSON>, a member
of the law-making military junta, said: ``It seem to me that the
`no' (vote) has won.''
   ``We are calm. We are going to analyze the situation,'' <PERSON>Matthei</PERSON>
added as he entered the downtown government palace at <TIME>1 a.m.</TIME> for an
emergency meeting with <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON>, the four-man junta and the
15-member Cabinet.
   Shortly after <PERSON>Matthei</PERSON>'s statement, the <ORGANIZATION>Interior Ministry</ORGANIZATION> at <TIME>2:10
a.m.</TIME> announced for the first time substantial voting returns that
showed the vote against <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON>'s continued rule prevailing. It
earlier had said <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON> was winning.
   With 15,969 of the country's 22,248 voting tables reporting, the
ministry counted 2,754,805 votes, or <PERCENT>53.3 percent</PERCENT>, against
<PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON>, and 2,290,972 votes, or <PERCENT>44.3 percent</PERCENT>, supporting the
president.
   There were also 53,292 blank votes and 68,108 votes voided for
being wrongly marked.
   An earlier opposition tally gave the ``no'' vote an even wider
margin with <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON> losing, <PERCENT>57.8 percent</PERCENT> to <PERCENT>39.9 percent</PERCENT>.
   <PERSON>Patricio Aylwin</PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION>Christian Democratic Party</ORGANIZATION> and
spokesman for the coalition, declared, ``It's clear that the
majority of Chileans have voted no.''
   On <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> in balloting that was peaceful and heavily
attended, Chileans voted on a proposal by <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON> and other
military commanders that he remain president until <DATE>1997</DATE>. The
right-wing, 72-year-old army chief seized power in a bloody coup in
<DATE>1973</DATE> that ousted the 3-year-old elected government of President
<PERSON>Salvador Allende</PERSON>, a Marxist who died during the takeover.
   If he had won, <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON> would have assumed a new 8-year term in
<DATE>March</DATE>. By losing, an open presidential election is to be held late
next year and the winner would assume power in <DATE>March 1990</DATE>, with
<PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON> remaining in power until then.
   Earlier, military patrols in armored personnel carriers and
trucks with mounted machine guns were seen circulating in
working-class neighborhoods and slums _ where anti-Pinochet
sentiment traditionally runs high _ that ring the capital. A few
hundred people danced in the streets of La Victoria slum in
southern <LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION>, waving banners and celebrating an anticipated
``no'' victory.
   ``We all voted no, because we are repressed,'' said one
participant, 50-year-old construction worker <PERSON>Jose Garrido</PERSON>.
   Jorge Zincke, military commander for the <LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION> area, reported
scattered incidents after the voting, which he said were being
controlled by police. He said anti-government demonstrators erected
barricades in the streets of <LOCATION>San Bernardo</LOCATION>, south of the capital,
and <PERSON>Puente Alto</PERSON>, to the southeast.
   He said six people were arrested for carrying arms and a public
bus was burned and its driver beaten.
   <LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION>'s streets were mainly empty as most Chileans heeded
opposition calls to stay at home.
   <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON> said earlier in an interview broadcast by <ORGANIZATION>Radio
Cooperativa</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION>, ``So far everything is calm, but I've got
some information that leaves me thinking. There are some people who
have seen individuals wearing ski-masks.'' He gave no details.
   Leftist urban guerrillas commonly employ ski masks, but both of
<LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>'s guerrilla groups have publicly announced a truce until
after the voting day.
   A huge turnout among the 7.4 million registered voters slowed
balloting at many polling places and could delay definitive
tallies, authorities said. Voting tables started closing at <TIME>5 p.m.</TIME>
and the counting began.
   Foreign observers said the plebiscite appeared to be open and
honestly conducted.
   Former President <PERSON>Oswaldo Hurtado</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Ecuador</LOCATION>, an observer, said:
``What I have seen is Chileans being able to cast their votes
freely and in private.''
   Official returns from the <ORGANIZATION>National Election Service</ORGANIZATION> are not
expected until <DATE>Friday</DATE>.
   Voting is mandatory and those who don't vote can be fined up to
22,000 pesos, or about <MONEY>$80</MONEY>.
   In <LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION>, the capital city where more than one-third of the
nation's 12 million people live, some voters showed up an hour
before polls began opening at <TIME>8 a.m.</TIME> Lines more than a mile long
had formed by midmorning, under bright sunlight in the <LOCATION>Southern
Hemisphere</LOCATION> <DATE>spring</DATE>.
   Pinochet, smiling and wearing a beige civilian suit, voted at a
downtown <LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION> station.

   Vice President <PERSON>Dan Quayle</PERSON>, after
receiving an unfriendly welcome from supporters of Gen. <PERSON>Augusto
Pinochet</PERSON>, said <DATE>Sunday</DATE> the outgoing military ruler assured him he
would obey <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>'s new civilian government.
   Quayle, meeting with <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON> on the last day of his 16{-year
presidency, quoted <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON> as saying ``there would be no problems
between himself and President (<LOCATION>Patricio</LOCATION>) <PERSON>Aylwin</PERSON> _ when President
<PERSON>Aylwin</PERSON> gave an order, that order would be complied with.''
   Quayle was jeered by a throng of Pinochet supporters when he
arrived for a 35-minute meeting at the general's walled residence.
   ``Go Away!'' they shouted. ``Son of a Whore!'' and ``Pinochet,
Pinochet!''
   Quayle waved to them as he got out of his limousine, apparently
unaware that their shouts were unfriendly.
   There was no violence, but <ORGANIZATION>Secret Service</ORGANIZATION> agents canceled plans
for <PERSON>Quayle</PERSON> to hold a sidewalk news conference near the
demonstrators. Following the <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON> meeting, the agents spirited
him away in his limousine as the crowd booed and made thumbs-down
gestures.
   Meanwhile, Nicaraguan president <PERSON>Daniel Ortega</PERSON>, who arrived in
<LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION> <DATE>Sunday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>, said he would like to meet with <PERSON>Quayle</PERSON> while
here. `I think it will be a good opportunity to talk with Vice
President <PERSON>Quayle</PERSON>,'' he said at a news conference when asked his
reaction to <PERSON>Quayle</PERSON>'s previous statements that he was willing to
hold such a meeting.
   Until <PERSON>Ortega</PERSON> was voted out of office <DATE>Feb. 25</DATE> and agreed to turn
over power to his successor, <PERSON>Quayle</PERSON> and other <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration
officials had avoided direct high-level talks with the <PERSON>Ortega</PERSON>
government although the two maintained formal diplomatic relations.
   Quayle's chief of staff, <PERSON>Bill Cristol</PERSON>, attended the <PERSON>Ortega</PERSON> news
conference and said: ``I suspect they'll (<PERSON>Quayle</PERSON> and <PERSON>Ortega</PERSON>) have a
chance to talk one way or the other. We'll what happens tomorrow.''
   Both men are scheduled to attend a luncheon <DATE>Monday</DATE> being hosted
by <PERSON>Aylwin</PERSON> for all the visiting government officials.
   Pinochet still heads the Chilean military, and <PERSON>Quayle</PERSON> aides said
the vice president told <ORGANIZATION>Pinochet</ORGANIZATION> the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> expected him to
respect the new civilian authority. Pinochet has said he would
honor <PERSON>Aylwin</PERSON>'s authority but has indicated he would not necessarily
consider other government officials his superiors.
   ``There was no debate. He knew who the people elected. He was
willing to abide by the wishes of the people. I found that most
encouraging,'' <PERSON>Quayle</PERSON> told reporters later.
   The vice president traveled to <ORGANIZATION>Valparaiso for Aylwin</ORGANIZATION>'s
inauguration later in the day on the third day of his South
American trip.
   <PERSON>Quayle</PERSON> said he emphasized to <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON> that ``his role in history
is just beginning to be recorded.''
   How he complies with the peaceful transition of government is as
important to <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON>'s historical legacy, <PERSON>Quayle</PERSON> said, as the
years of his presidency when widespread right-wing terror prevailed.
   Pinochet's regime came under increasing <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> pressure to respect
human rights and was subjected to a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> embargo on military aid
and sales.
   <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> officials traveling with <PERSON>Quayle</PERSON> said that, unlike most of
the foreign representatives who came for <PERSON>Aylwin</PERSON>'s inauguration,
<PERSON>Quayle</PERSON> and the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration had no qualms about a
face-to-face meeting with <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON>.
   Several other heads of state arranged go directly to the
inaugural ceremony so they would not have to greet <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON>. That
included <LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION>'s President <PERSON>Carlos Andres Perez</PERSON> and Spanish
Prime Minister <PERSON>Philipe Gonzalez</PERSON>, both of whom <PERSON>Quayle</PERSON> met <DATE>Friday</DATE> in
<LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION> en route to <LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION>.
   But <PERSON>Quayle</PERSON> said <DATE>Sunday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME> that ``the right thing is to pay
respects to the current president.''
   <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> officials who participated in <DATE>Sunday</DATE>'s meeting described
<PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON> as proud and unapologetic about the past but accepting of
the election that brought his 16-year rule to an end.
   Pinochet wore a white military jacket and waved briefly from his
balcony to his cheering fans.
   ``He was a very proud man. He's proud of what he's done for the
people of <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>,'' <PERSON>Quayle</PERSON> said.
   Pinochet began the meeting by comparing himself to the reformers
who are bringing democratic-style government to in <LOCATION>Eastern Europe</LOCATION>.
``<DATE>Sixteen years ago</DATE>, we did what is happening in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> now. We
weren't understood. What is happening with the <LOCATION>Berlin</LOCATION> Wall _ that
happened to us 16 years ago,'' <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON> said while posing for
photographers prior to the <PERSON>Quayle</PERSON> meeting.
   Pinochet overthrew the elected government of <ORGANIZATION>Marxist President
Salvador Allende</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1973</DATE>. Thousands of Allende's supporters were
rounded up and many were tortured or killed. Victims of the human
rights abuses have vowed to press charges against the military once
Aylwin takes office.
   A senior official traveling with <PERSON>Quayle</PERSON> said the disposition of
those matters would be up to Chilean authorities.
   The <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration has emphasized human rights issues
abroad, but ``we didn't come here to debate the <DATE>last 17 years</DATE>,''
the official said.
   However, <PERSON>Quayle</PERSON> and the other <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> officials with him said the
administration hopes to see progress under <PERSON>Aylwin</PERSON> on the
prosecution in the <DATE>1976</DATE> assassination in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> of <LOCATION>Orlando
Letelier</LOCATION>, a former Allende cabinet minister. The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> government
has pressed unsuccessfully for the prosecution of two Chilean
military officers in that bombing.
   <PERSON>Quayle</PERSON> said, however, that issue did not arise in his meeting
with <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON>.

<HEAD>Political Literature Booming as Restrictions on Politics Fade</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EDUARDO GALLARDO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Political literature is booming as the
bans and restrictions imposed by <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>'s right-wing military
government appear to be coming to an end.
   Books ranging from <PERSON>Gabriel Garcia Marquez</PERSON>'s latest to
controversial political essays have become best-sellers, and
literary experts believe the trend will continue because of the
outgoing government of conservative President Gen. <PERSON>Augusto Pinochet</PERSON>.
   After seizing power in a bloody <DATE>1973</DATE> coup, <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON> decreed a
total ban on political activities. <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> was closed, political
parties disbanded and severe censorship on books and the news media
were enforced.
   In the last few years, however, most bans have gradually
disappeared as the nation has prepared to pick a successor to
<LOCATION>Pinochet</LOCATION>. The vote, in the first presidential election since <DATE>1970</DATE>,
is scheduled for <DATE>Dec. 14</DATE>.
   Political activity now is virtually free, bringing a boom to
political literature.
   Experts say the long period they lived without access to a
variety of freely published information left Chileans ripe for the
wave of political literature.
   ``The public was thirsty for political information,'' said
<PERSON>Ignacio Gonzalez</PERSON>, a journalist who authored ``The Day Allende
Died,'' one of the most successful books in <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION> in <DATE>1988</DATE>.
   The novelized book is a vivid, well-researched account of events
at the government house on <DATE>Sept. 11, 1973</DATE>, the day <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON> toppled
elected President <PERSON>Salvador Allende</PERSON>. Allende, a Marxist, died in the
takeover.
   Gonzalez' book sold 11,000 copies in three months, a notable
figure in this small <LOCATION>South American</LOCATION> country where sales of 3,000
books is considered a best-seller.
   ``I think people reacted with enthusiasm because of the
attraction of learning things that had been forbidden to them for so
long,'' <PERSON>Gonzalez</PERSON> said in an interview.
   Even more successful was ``The Silent Revolution,'' a report on
the achievements of the <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON> government, by <PERSON>Joaquin Lavin</PERSON>, a
conservative economist.
   Published in <DATE>December 1987</DATE>, <PERSON>Lavin</PERSON>'s book sold over 150,000 copies
in 11 months, becoming the second-largest selling book in <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>'s
history, <PERSON>Lavin</PERSON> claims. He said it places second only to ``Farewell
to the 7th Regiment,'' a novel based on the <DATE>1879</DATE> war that <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION> won
over <LOCATION>Peru</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Bolivia</LOCATION>.
   An official at the <ORGANIZATION>Chilean Book Chamber</ORGANIZATION> said that although no
precise figures have been compiled, <PERSON>Lavin</PERSON>'s claim appears correct.
   ``I just tried to tell Chileans how the country is that they live
in these days,'' <PERSON>Lavin</PERSON> said. ``The book shows them how their country
has changed.''
   Gonzalez and <PERSON>Lavin</PERSON> believe public interest on political books
will survive the end of military rule.
   Book records show that at least three political titles have
appeared in the weekly lists of 6 top-selling books for over a year.
   The best-selling non-political book in recent months was ``The
General in his Labyrinth,'' a biography of <PERSON>Simon Bolivar</PERSON>, the
Venezuelan-born liberator of <LOCATION>South America</LOCATION>, by Colombian Nobel
Prize-winning author <PERSON>Gabriel Garcia Marquez</PERSON>. The book has sold
65,000 copies in eight months.
   Experts say it's too early to determine the effects the
availability of political books is having on Chileans.
   Among the leading books on political matters in recent years are
those by <PERSON>Gonzalez</PERSON> and <PERSON>Lavin</PERSON>.
   Also, ``Gen. <PERSON>Prats</PERSON>' Memoirs,'' by Gen. <PERSON>Carlos Prats</PERSON>, the army
commander under Allende who was assassinated in exile in <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>,
published postumously; ``The <PERSON>Buchi Phenomenon</PERSON>,'' a
bigraphical-political study on <PERSON>Hernan Buchi</PERSON>, the pro-government
presidential candidate in the <DATE>December</DATE> election; ``<LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> Here, the
<LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> and Perestroika`` as seen by a Chilean journalist,
<PERSON>Bernardo</PERSON> de la Masa; ``Yes or No,'' a study prior to last <DATE>October</DATE>'s
referendum in which voters rejected a military proposal to extend
<PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON>'s rule until <DATE>1997</DATE>, by <PERSON>Hermogenes Perez de Arce</PERSON>, a
right-wing author and politician.

<PERSON>MR Eduardo Frei</PERSON>, leader of <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>'s Christian Democrats, looks set to secure
the presidential nomination of the country's ruling coalition after primary
elections on <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Reuter</ORGANIZATION> reports from <LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION>.
He took more than 60 per cent of the votes of some 600,000 party members and
supporters, electoral officials said. His Socialist rival, <PERSON>Mr Ricardo Lagos</PERSON>,
received about 38 per cent, the officials said.
Under the coalition's complex selection procedure, the votes on <DATE>Sunday</DATE> were
assigned to delegates to cast at a final convention next <DATE>Sunday</DATE>. However,
the winner <DATE>last Sunday</DATE> is sure of victory at the convention, where the
coalition will unveil its campaign manifesto.
The winner of the primary, the first in <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>, which returned to democracy
in <DATE>1990</DATE> after 17 years of military rule, will be the strong favourite to
become the next president, to be elected on <DATE>December 11</DATE>.
Opinion polls before the primary gave <PERSON>Mr Frei</PERSON>, from the same party as
President <PERSON>Patricio Aylwin</PERSON>, some 49 per cent of national support, compared to
3.5 per cent for his nearest right-wing rival. The polls also showed support
from the ruling coalition's left-wing parties could mean <PERSON>Mr Frei</PERSON> taking more
than two-thirds of the presidential vote.
From <LOCATION>Stockholm</LOCATION>: A group of Chilean exiles protesting against a visit by
President <PERSON>Aylwin</PERSON> hurled eggs at him during a demonstration in the centre of
<LOCATION>Stockholm</LOCATION> yesterday.
Organisations representing some of the 30,000 Chileans living in <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION> have
stated <PERSON>Mr Aylwin</PERSON> is not welcome because of what they see as his moral
support of the coup in <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION> that toppled President <PERSON>Salvador Allende</PERSON> in
<DATE>1973</DATE>.
<PERSON>Mr Aylwin</PERSON> repeated yesterday that he had never endorsed the coup.

   President <PERSON>Patricio Aylwin</PERSON> called for an
end to violence and hate as he took over from long-ruling Gen.
<PERSON>Augusto Pinochet</PERSON>, but street disturbances marred the celebration of
an end to military rule.
   ``<LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION> doesn't want more violence, it doesn't want more war,''
<PERSON>Aylwin</PERSON> declared late <DATE>Sunday</DATE> from the balcony of the presidential
palace after his inauguration earlier in the day.
   Thousands below cheered the end of <LOCATION>Pinochet</LOCATION>'s 16-year rule.
   ``This infant being born, this liberty we are reconquering, we
have to take care of it,'' said the 71-year-old <PERSON>Aylwin</PERSON>. He said
that would require ``knowing how to respect one another, never
again having Chileans divided into enemies.''
   Aylwin's first official act was to pardon all political
prisoners. His government also restored diplomatic relations with
the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>East Germany</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Yugoslavia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Czechoslovakia</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION>.
   <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION> is the last in a series of South American countries to
restore elected civilian rule in the last decade.
   But <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON>, 74, who seized power in a bloody <DATE>1973</DATE> coup that
toppled Marxist President <PERSON>Salvador Allende</PERSON>, plans to stay on as
commander of the powerful 60,000-man army and has rejected <PERSON>Aylwin</PERSON>'s
requests he retire from the military.
   Aylwin, who won office in <DATE>December</DATE> with the backing of centrist
and moderate leftist groups, assumed office to thunderous cheers
and applause in a half-finished congressional building in the
seaport of <LOCATION>Valparaiso</LOCATION>, 70 miles northwest of <LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION>.
   Beside him during the ceremony was <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON>, his dark blue
military uniform bedecked with gold medals. The general shook
<PERSON>Aylwin</PERSON>'s hand after <PERSON>Aylwin</PERSON>, a centrist Christian Democrat, slipped
on the presidential sash.
   Aylwin has vowed to restore respect for human rights and civil
liberties and put more emphasis on social services. But he plans no
major changes in <LOCATION>Pinochet</LOCATION>'s largely successful free-market economic
program.
   A newly elected congress, dominated by foes of <LOCATION>Pinochet</LOCATION>, also
took power <DATE>Sunday</DATE>.
   Vice President <PERSON>Dan Quayle</PERSON> said <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON> assured him he will obey
the new civilian government. Quayle, who attended the inauguration,
was jeered earlier <DATE>Sunday</DATE> by <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON> supporters upon arriving for
a 35-minute meeting at the general's walled residence.
   ``Go Away!'' they shouted. ``Son of a whore!'' and ``Pinochet,
Pinochet!''
   A <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> arms embargo placed on <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION> since <DATE>1976</DATE> because of human
rights violations remains in effect. The embargo was proposed by
<PERSON>Sen. Edward Kennedy</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-Mass.</LOCATION>, who also was at the inauguration.
   Pinochet was forced to call elections when a proposal to extend
his rule to <DATE>1997</DATE> was rejected in a <DATE>1988</DATE> referendum. He entered the
new congress as supporters chanted his name and detractors in the
gallery shouted ``Murderer, murderer!''
   Earlier, a group of demonstrators tossed tomatoes and rocks at
<LOCATION>Pinochet</LOCATION>'s open-topped convertible limosine. He was not injured in
the incident, which panicked horses carrying cermonially dressed
soldiers. One horse bumped hard into the car.
   After the ceremony, <PERSON>Aylwin</PERSON> returned to <LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION>, the capital,
and hundreds of thousands of people lined the route into the city
to cheer as he passed in an open car.
   The celebrants waved red, white and blue Chilean flags and
chanted anti-Pinochet slogans including ``He's fallen now, he's
fallen now.'' For years, during demonstrations against military
rule, the most popular chant was ``He's going to fall.''
   As darkness approached, bands of leftist youths set up
barricades of burning trash and threw rocks and sticks at police.
   Helmeted anti-riot squads responded with water cannons and harsh
tear gas, which spread through downtown streets. The clashes
persisted for several hours before calm returned, leaving the
streets full of debris, including pulled-up street signs and
overturned police barricades.
   Several people were seen bleeding or overcome by the gas and
<LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION>'s central emergency hospital reported early <DATE>today</DATE> that 122
people were treated and four remained hospitalized with broken
bones. Police said 79 officers were injured, 10 of them seriously.
   Police were seen hauling off several youths, some of whom wore
emblems of the Communist or other leftist parties. Police sources
said ``more than 100'' demonstrators were arrested, but no exact
figure was immediately available.
   Aylwin's interior minister, <PERSON>Enrique Krauss</PERSON>, said the street
violence ``soiled the dignity, the cleanliness, of this occasion.''
Krauss spoke to reporters upon arrival at an <TIME>evening</TIME> ball for
<PERSON>Aylwin</PERSON>, his closest supporters and foreign dignitaries.
   Another celebration was planned this evening in <LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION>'s
<ORGANIZATION>National Stadium</ORGANIZATION>, long a symbol of political repression and human

<HEAD>Books and Authors: The Story of a Storyteller</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Isabel Allende is a storyteller. ``<PERSON>Eva Luna</PERSON>,''
her third novel, is the story of a storyteller.
   ``I come from a long order of tradition,'' <PERSON>Allende</PERSON> said in a
recent interview. ``I used to listen to the maid and cook tell
stories in the kitchen. I loved that. I've read stories since I was
very little. I grew up with storytelling.''
   ``<PERSON>Eva Luna</PERSON>'' (<ORGANIZATION>Knopf</ORGANIZATION>, <MONEY>$18.95</MONEY>) takes place in a Latin American
country closely resembling <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>. The title character is orphaned
as a child and grows up poor, working as a domestic. But she soon
discovers she can earn a living by telling stories.
   ``I never realized it was something that I had and that I could
trade for something else,'' <PERSON>Allende</PERSON> said. ``Like <PERSON>Eva Luna</PERSON>, I
realized when I was 40 that I had been trading stories for other
goods and making a living of it.''
   Storytelling, the author explained, is a way of preserving
memory. Since leaving <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION> after the <DATE>1973</DATE> military coup, she has
struggled to remember the environment that shaped her as a child.
   ``I realized about myself that I have lost something that was
invisible, that I could not put in words,'' said <PERSON>Allende</PERSON>, who
became a resident of <LOCATION>Caracas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION>. ``The only word I could
think of was roots. It's memory.''
   And what Allende misses goes beyond specific sights and sounds.
Living in a foreign country, she struggles for a sense of identity.
   ``If you walk in your own city, in your own country with your
people, you hear the language of your own country. You have the
feeling that somehow you know the subtle rules and you know how to
get along.
   ``When you're taken away from that, you don't belong anywhere.
You're all by yourself, you have no roots and the memory of the
past starts fading away.''
   So Allende uses her stories to keep the past alive.
   ``I have the feeling I have lost my family, my country, my
friends, the accent of my own language,'' she said. ``But very
specifically, the memory _ something that had been with me
naturally. Now I'm reconstructing every day. Now it's finally mine,
it's printed, portable. I can take it with me.''
   Allende, whose father was a diplomat, was born in <DATE>1942</DATE> in <LOCATION>Lima</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Peru</LOCATION>, but moved to <LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>, at the age of 3. She lived
comfortably as a child and was spared the poverty under which so
many in her country lived.
   ``I grew up in a world on contrasts _ extreme wealth and extreme
poverty,'' she said. ``I belonged to the bubble. That means I've
been fortunate, but I was also aware of that inequality. Though I
was always touched by that, I never came to terms with it until the
military coup.''
   She married an engineer when she was 19 and had two children.
She supported the government of <PERSON>Salvador Allende</PERSON>, a Socialist
elected president in <DATE>1970</DATE>. (The author says she's a distant
cousin). He was overthrown by the military in <DATE>1973</DATE> and executed.
After Gen. <PERSON>Augusto Pinochet</PERSON> took over and declared a state of
emergency, he tortured and murdered political opponents and
censored the press.
   Allende, a journalist at the time, recalled the day of the coup:
``I left my house very early in the morning and I went to my job. I
saw only soldiers passing in tanks and airplanes and everybody
hiding in their homes. I saw the bombing of the (President's)
palace. That very day, I had the feeling my whole life was
changing.''
   She was an outspoken opponent of the regime and went into exile
in <DATE>1975</DATE>, leaving her family behind. They were later reunited.
   ``When I learned I could be taken into prison with my children
and have them tortured in front of me, it became unbearable. I had
to leave,'' she said.
   Her first novel, ``House of the Spirits,'' was released in <DATE>1982</DATE>
and combined her strong political beliefs with ``magic realism,'' a
writing style associated with such Latin American writers as
<PERSON>Gabriel Garcia Marquez</PERSON>.
   ``You can not be an artist for the sake of art only in <LOCATION>Latin
America</LOCATION>,'' she said. ``I would say the same goes for any country in
the world where there is great repression and violence.''
   Magic is also essential. Allende writes in <LOCATION>Eva Luna</LOCATION>:
   ``I was writing a new episode every day, totally immersed in the
world. I was creating with the all-encompassing power of words,
transformed into a multifaceted being, reproduced to infinity,
seeing my own reflection in multiple mirrors, living countless
lives, speaking with many voices.''
   And magic also is part of her roots: ``It's a combination of
legends, superstitions, myths. The Indian culture, the African
culture. The dreams of the Spaniards who came here. The possibility
of finding Utopia.''
   Allende's second novel, ``Of Love and Shadows,'' came out in
<DATE>1987</DATE>, and had the same themes of good and evil, darkness and light,
that appear in all her works.
   She balances <PERSON>Eva Luna</PERSON>'s passionate love affairs with the
violence and oppression of the outside world.
   ``I think that I'm surrounded by violence, shadows, confusion,''
the author said. ``Writing is maybe a naive attempt to make the
world more comprehensible, more tolerable.
   ``Shadows for me are all those things that are threatening and
have always been there, are still there. Death, repression, abuse,
inequality, mystery _ things in which I'm immersed, constantly.''
   Allende is divorced from her first husband and recently married
a <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> lawyer. With Chileans rejecting the presidency of
Pinochet in a recent plebescite, she will visit the country in
<DATE>December</DATE>.
   ``I froze a country 15 years ago and took it with me,'' she
said. ``When I go back, I won't know where I'll belong. Who will be
my friend when I go back?''
   But no matter what, <ORGANIZATION>Allende</ORGANIZATION> will go on telling stories.
   ``<PERSON>Eva Luna</PERSON> can not only trade the stories, she can make her life
better and others around her. She makes the world more tolerable.
That's what I try to do all the time.''

<HEAD>Former Air Force Chief In Critical Condition After Assassination
Bid</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN NOBLET</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Marxist guerrillas claimed responsibility
for the attempted assassination of a retired air force chief who
helped lead the <DATE>1973</DATE> overthrow of leftist President <PERSON>Salvador
Allende</PERSON>.
   The shooting of <PERSON>Gustavo Leigh</PERSON> and a business partner <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>
was the first political attack since an elected, civilian
government replaced Gen. <PERSON>Augusto Pinochet</PERSON> after 16{ years of
right-wing military rule.
   Cabinet ministers, military officials and the <ORGANIZATION>Roman Catholic
Church</ORGANIZATION> condemned the shooting and swore not to let it or threats of
future attacks weaken the democracy that was reborn 11 days ago.
   Witnesses said two young men with handguns burst into the
fourth-floor offices of a real estate company run by <PERSON>Leigh</PERSON> and
another retired air force general, <PERSON>Enrique Ruiz</PERSON>, in <LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION>'s
wealthy Providencia neighborhood.
   The two fired point-blank at <LOCATION>Leigh</LOCATION> and Ruiz then fled, police
said.
   Leigh, 69, was hit in the face, chest, stomach and both arms, a
hospital report said. Late <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, the hospital said he lost an
eye and was conscious, in critical but stable condition after five
hours of surgery.
   Ruiz was reported in serious condition.
   In telephone calls to local radio stations, a spokeswoman for a
maverick faction of the pro-Communist <ORGANIZATION>Manuel Rodriguez Patriotic
Front</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>'s main guerrilla organization, claimed responsibility.
   The spokeswoman, who uses the name <PERSON>Mariela Vargas</PERSON>, called <PERSON>Leigh</PERSON>
``one of the cruelest ideologues behind the thousands of killings
committed during the dictatorship.'' She termed Ruiz ``an
accomplice.''
   She warned of future attacks _ ``We will continue to exercise
our right to popular justice.''
   Leigh commanded the air force during the bloody <DATE>September 1973</DATE>
coup, directing warplanes to bomb the presidential palace where
Allende was holed up. The elected civilian president, a Marxist,
died in the coup.
   Leigh, part of the subsequent four-man military junta led by
<PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON>, declared the military's mission was ``to cut out the
Marxist cancer'' from Chilean society. The armed forces began a
harsh campaign of anti-leftist repression.
   Pinochet fired <PERSON>Leigh</PERSON> in <DATE>June 1978</DATE> after a series of policy
disagreements, and <PERSON>Leigh</PERSON> became a public critic of <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON> and his
attempts to remain in power.
   Pinochet handed over power <DATE>March 11</DATE> to an elected civilian
successor, President <PERSON>Patricio Aylwin</PERSON>, a Christian Democrat backed
by a coalition of centrist and leftist parties.
   Aylwin canceled scheduled activities <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> to keep informed
about developments following the shooting.
   His interior minister, <PERSON>Enrique Krauss</PERSON>, called the shootings ``a
cowardly attack'' and promised an intensive investigation.
   Education Minister <PERSON>Ricardo Lagos</PERSON> said it was ``an attempt to
destabilize the institutional order.''
   Defense Minister <PERSON>Patricio Rojas</PERSON> pledged ``no provocation will
alter the democratic vocation of the Chilean people ... or the
stability that the government gives to democracy.''
   Air force commander Gen. <PERSON>Fernando Matthei</PERSON> called it ``an attack
against each and every member of the air force. ... It doesn't
contribute to the positive climate of the democratic process.''
   The attack came on the 60th anniversary of the founding of the
Chilean air force, and the institution had suspended all training
activities to celebrate the date.

<TEXT>
   Gen. <PERSON>Augusto Pinochet</PERSON> is taking his final
bows, declaring democracy restored after a coup and more than 16
years in power, but the civilians who will follow him say the job
has just begun.
   Pinochet says he is leaving a thriving, orderly nation to
President-elect <PERSON>Patricio Aylwin</PERSON>, who takes office <DATE>March 11</DATE>.
   ``We promised to restore democracy and we have done it,''
<PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON> said recently on a farewell tour of this narrow,
3,000-mile-long nation on <LOCATION>South America</LOCATION>'s west coast. ``We gave it
the indispensable stability required for living in peace, freedom
and solidarity.''
   His critics don't see it that way.
   ``The transition to democracy will be very, very hard, but the
alternative to tackling the difficulties is remaining under a
dictatorship,'' said <PERSON>Jorge Arrate</PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION>Socialist Party</ORGANIZATION>.
   His party is prominent in <LOCATION>Aylwin</LOCATION>'s center-left coalition. Arrate
and others in the alliance say they are inheriting a powder keg of
social problems long ignored or suppressed by <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON>'s military
government.
   They say the new administration will be hard-pressed by the need
for more social services, wage demands from labor and the desire
for justice in cases of human rights abuses.
   Pinochet, 74, insists on retaining command of the 60,000-man
army for up to eight more years, as permitted by the <DATE>1980</DATE>
constitution his government wrote.
   He also hints at an eventual return to power and has not ruled
out running in the <DATE>1994</DATE> election. At public gatherings in the
waning days of his presidency, supporters can be heard shouting
``You'll be back soon!'' or ``Until <DATE>1994</DATE>!''
   The general held a referendum in <DATE>1988</DATE>, trying to get approval
for an eight-year extension of his presidency, but the voters said
no. That forced him to call an election, and <PERSON>Aylwin</PERSON>, a 71-year-old
centrist Christian Democrat, got <PERCENT>55 percent</PERCENT> of the vote.
   Small but enthusiastic crowds have turned out for <ORGANIZATION>Pinochet</ORGANIZATION>'s
farewell tour, which uses the slogan ``Mission accomplished.''
   Pinochet proudly tells them that <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION> enjoys one of <LOCATION>Latin
America</LOCATION>'s healthiest economies, one of its lowest inflation rates _
about <PERCENT>20 percent</PERCENT> a year _ and a gross national product that has
grown steadily for six years.
   He says the political and social disorder that was rampant when
he overthrew the elected government of President <PERSON>Salvador Allende</PERSON>,
an avowed Marxist, in <DATE>September 1973</DATE> has been replaced by an
orderly society.
   The <DATE>1980</DATE> constitution provides an institutional bulwark against
chaos or a Communist threat, according to <LOCATION>Pinochet</LOCATION>.
   Critics, however, consider the claims unfounded and the tour a
disgrace.
   ``This idea that we have to express our gratitude, it's
absurd,'' <PERSON>Arrate</PERSON> said. ``He's the only Chilean president ever to
stage a farewell carnival.''
   <PERSON>Arrate</PERSON> said <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON>'s claim to have laid the institutional
groundwork for democracy was contradicted by last-minute laws that
cut <PERSON>Aylwin</PERSON>'s authority and gave armed forces unprecedented
autonomy, among other changes.
   The new government plans to modify many of the laws, but ``the
problem is you lose time in undoing those things,'' said <PERSON>Ricardo
Ffrench-Davis</PERSON>, an economist with <PERSON>Aylwin</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>Christian Democratic
Party</ORGANIZATION>.
   He said <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON>'s pride in the economic growth of the last six
years ``is arbitrary, like so many arbitrary things that have
occurred under this government.''
   Pinochet also must take responsibility for ``the worst recession
in <LOCATION>Latin America</LOCATION>'' in the early <DATE>1980s</DATE>, when production in <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>
fell by more than <PERCENT>13 percent</PERCENT> and unemployment soared to <PERCENT>20 percent</PERCENT>
or more, Ffrench-Davis said.
   Improvement since then has represented recovery, with very
little growth, the economist said, and poor people have not had a
proper share in it.
   ``If you take the top <PERCENT>20 percent</PERCENT> of the population and the
bottom <PERCENT>20 percent</PERCENT>, the gap has been growing all these years,'' he
said.
   Ffrench-Davis said there is a desperate need for better public
education and health services, but he and other economists in
<LOCATION>Aylwin</LOCATION>'s camp praise the existing free-market, export-oriented
economic program and do not plan major changes.
   To distribute <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>'s wealth, ``the economy must grow, and for
the economy to grow, you must have stability,'' he said.
   Most unions were suppressed under <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON> and <PERSON>Aylwin</PERSON> also
expects a chorus of demands for higher wages, but <PERSON>Arrate</PERSON> said
workers and the poor must not expect too much.
   ``We can't correct from one day to the next all the inequities
that have accumulated during 16 years,'' he said. ``All we can do
is give signs that the government has changed its tendency.''
   Democracy is expected to bring a cry for justice in hundreds of
pending cases of alleged human rights violations by security
forces. At least 700 people disappeared after the coup and
thousands were jailed and tortured.
   Demands by rights groups for swift and severe punishment
probably will not be met. Aylwin has stressed the need for national
reconciliation and said justice must be tempered by a spirit of
pardon.

YOUTHS, POLICE SKIRMISH IN FIRST VIOLENCE OF CHILEAN CAMPAIGN

<P>
Campaigning in <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>'s first presidential election in 19 years ended <DATE>Monday</DATE> 
with tear gas and rock-throwing skirmishes involving youths claiming to be 
followers of the rival candidates, the first violence in an otherwise peaceful 
race. 
</P>
<P>
After the final rally by rightist candidate <PERSON>Hernan Buchi</PERSON>, youths chanting 
slogans in favor of opposition front-runner <PERSON>Patricio Aylwin</PERSON> stoned police 
patrolling <PERSON>Alameda Bernardo O'Higgins</PERSON>, a broad avenue in the center of the 
capital. Police responded with barrages of high-pressure water and tear-gas 
grenades. 
</P>
<P>
No more than 200 youths appeared to take part actively in the clashes that 
lasted nearly three hours. 
</P>
<P>
By mid-evening, hundreds of <PERSON>Buchi</PERSON> supporters marched from the rally site to the 
<LOCATION>Alameda</LOCATION>, and scattered fighting broke out between the <PERSON>Buchi</PERSON> marchers and the 
groups that had been fighting the police. Several people were hit by stones. It 
was unclear whether any of the injuries were serious. 
</P>
<P>
The race to succeed outgoing President <PERSON>Augusto Pinochet</PERSON>, who took power after a 
bloody <DATE>1973</DATE> coup, had evolved calmly. By law, campaigning ended <DATE>Monday</DATE> to allow 
voters two days of reflection before <DATE>Thursday</DATE>'s balloting, which also will 
decide 120 <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> and 38 <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> seats. 
</P>
<P>
Aylwin, far ahead in the polls, heads a 17-party coalition of parties ranging 
from center to left. Buchi, <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON>'s former finance minister, is supported by 
two rightist parties. 
</P>
<P>
Buchi has stressed the social order and economic progress brought by the 
<PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON> government, in contrast to the turmoil of the 1970-73 rule of Marxist 
President <PERSON>Salvador Allende</PERSON>, which ended with <ORGANIZATION>Pinochet</ORGANIZATION>'s coup. 
</P>
<P>
It is not clear whether the rock-throwers who attacked the police and the <PERSON>Buchi</PERSON> 
supporters were far-left militants, thugs out to stir up trouble or 
provocateurs. Any violence ill serves the <PERSON>Aylwin</PERSON> coalition in its attempt to 
project an image of moderation and accommodation. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, tens of thousands of people filled a major <LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION> avenue for <PERSON>Buchi</PERSON>'s 
final rally, far fewer than the hundreds of thousands who attended <PERSON>Aylwin</PERSON>'s 
final campaign celebration on <DATE>Sunday</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
The athletic 40-year-old <PERSON>Buchi</PERSON> repeatedly attacked the opposition alliance for 
including parties and candidates who had participated in <LOCATION>Allende</LOCATION>'s Popular 
Unity coalition. Buchi suggested that <PERSON>Aylwin</PERSON>, a centrist who leads the 
<ORGANIZATION>Christian Democratic Party</ORGANIZATION>, would prove unable to control the leftists in his 
alliance. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody knows if a vote for <PERSON>Patricio Aylwin</PERSON> is a vote for the Christian 
Democrats or the Socialists or the Communists," <PERSON>Buchi</PERSON> said. "Are you against 
violence and terrorism? They are not."

   Thousands of protesters battled police
following the largest anti-government rally since the military
nominated right-wing President <PERSON>Augusto Pinochet</PERSON> as the only
candidate in a fall presidential referendum.
   More than 100,000 people packed blocks of a broad avenue in
central <LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION> on <DATE>Sunday</DATE> chanting ``Pinochet's going to fall!''
   Police arrested 262 demonstrators and a police officer and eight
civilians were wounded, said Gen. <PERSON>Sergio Badiola</PERSON>, the governor of
<LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION>. He said six of the injured, including the policeman, were
seriously hurt.
   Police fired tear gas, buckshot and water cannons when tens of
thousands of people began a march on the government palace after
the generally peaceful rally had ended.
   Organizers said 300,000 people attended the rally and
journalists estimated the crowd at more than 100,000.
   Gen. <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON>, the 72-year-old army commander who has ruled
<LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION> with a military junta since a coup in <DATE>September 1973</DATE>, was
selected last <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> by himself and the commanders of the <ORGANIZATION>navy</ORGANIZATION>,
air force and national police as the sole candidate in the
presidential referendum scheduled for <DATE>Oct. 5</DATE>.
   <DATE>Sunday</DATE>'s rally was the largest show of force by the opposition
since <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON>, seeking popular support, lifted on <DATE>Aug. 27</DATE> the
state of emergency that restricted public gatherings.
   There had been scattered street demonstrations after <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON>'s
nomination was announced <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> and three people were shot to
death and hundreds were arrested.
   <PERSON>Hector Moya</PERSON>, the main speaker at <DATE>Sunday</DATE>'s rally, told the
cheering crowd: ``We can now clearly see that the <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON> regime
already has been defeated.'' Moya is the head of the truckers'
union.
   When the rally ended a column of tens of thousands of people
marched to the city's center, blocking traffic. Police broke up the
procession and there were skirmishes throughout the area between
rock-throwing demonstrators and police firing birdshot and tear gas.
   Pinochet, in an ``open letter to the men and women of my
country'' printed <DATE>Sunday</DATE> in most local newspapers, promised full
democracy if he is returned to office in the referendum.
   ``If Chileans call me to govern, each one of them will govern,
too,'' the letter said.
   In an interview printed <DATE>Sunday</DATE> in the conservative newspaper <PERSON>El
Mercurio</PERSON>, <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON> also promised to resign as army commander and
govern as a civilian.
   <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>'s 7.2 million voters are to vote either for or against
<ORGANIZATION>Pinochet</ORGANIZATION> in the referendum.
   If approved, <ORGANIZATION>Pinochet</ORGANIZATION> will begin a new eight-year term in <DATE>March</DATE>.
If rejected, an open presidential election is to be held in
<DATE>December 1989</DATE> with <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON> remaining in power until an elected
president takes office.
   Pinochet led the <DATE>1973</DATE> military coup that ousted the elected
government of Marxist President <PERSON>Salvador Allende</PERSON>.
   Ricardo <LOCATION>Lagos</LOCATION>, a socialist opposition leader, called the rally
``the first step toward the final defeat of Pinochet.''
   Rally participants, including Chileans who have returned from
exile, sang and danced to political songs.
   Among the former exiles was <PERSON>Isabel Allende</PERSON>, 44, a daughter of
the late president, who died during the coup. She received a huge
ovation when her name was announced and joined in the dancing with
<LOCATION>Lagos</LOCATION>.
   Pinochet on <DATE>Thursday</DATE> decreed an end to political exile.

<HEAD>Pinochet Says He Will Abolish Chile's Secret Police</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Military President <PERSON>Augusto Pinochet</PERSON>
announced he will abolish the country's feared secret police before
an elected civilian government takes power in <DATE>March</DATE>.
   Pinochet made the surprise statement <DATE>Friday</DATE> during an appearance
in <LOCATION>Coihaique</LOCATION>, 1,350 miles south of <LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION>, the capital.
   Without elaborating, <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON> said the secret police, known by
their Spanish-language acronym <ORGANIZATION>CNI</ORGANIZATION>, would be dissolved before the
military junta that has ruled <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION> since a <DATE>1973</DATE> coup steps aside.
   Human rights organizations have accused the secret police of
using torture and committing other abuses against members of the
country's opposition.
   Pinochet also said <DATE>Friday</DATE> that <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>'s armed forces would not
allow members of the military to be tried for alleged human rights
abuses by the civilian government.
   Centrist politician <PERSON>Patricio Aylwin</PERSON>, the opposition's candidate
for president, is favored to defeat government candidate <PERSON>Hernan
Buchi _ Pinochet</PERSON>'s former finance minister _ in <DATE>Dec. 14</DATE> balloting.
The new president will be installed <DATE>March 11</DATE>.
   Opposition members have called for the prosecution of military
officers accused of human rights abuses.
   But <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON> said the military would not permit its members to
be ``scorned and humiliated for actions destined to save <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>.''
   More than 700 people disappeared and thousands were arrested,
tortured or sent into exile in a wave of anti-leftist repression
after <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON> and other military officers ousted elected civilian
President <PERSON>Salvador Allende</PERSON>. In recent years, violent repression has
declined significantly but some acts against dissidents continue,
human rights groups contend.
   In a referendum on <DATE>Oct. 5, 1988</DATE>, Chileans rejected the

   President <PERSON>Augusto Pinochet</PERSON> called for
support from opposition leaders on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> after violent protests
followed his nomination as the only candidate in an <DATE>October</DATE>
presidential referendum.
   Authorities said hundreds were arrested during widespread
rioting <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> and three people were killed, including two
teen-age boys, as residents threw open their windows and banged
pots and pans in defiance.
   Rioting in the streets broke out after the military junta
nominated <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON>, who took part in the selection process, to be
the sole nominee in an <DATE>October</DATE> presidential referendum.
   In a nationally broadcast address <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>, <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON> made
a rare appeal for opposition backing. In previous addresses, he has
dismissed opponents as ``traitors,'' ``rats,'' ``highwaymen'' and
``cowards.''
   ``Our democracy needs the collaboration of all Chileans,'' he
said. ``I call today on my compatriots, supporters and opponents,
to assume this noble task. Chile needs you.''
   The remarks followed huge demonstratons by thousands of people
in the capital and elsewhere.
   In <LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION> alone, 846 protesters were arrested during the
day-long street demonstrations and clashes, a report from the
national police said. It gave no precise figure for arrests outside
the capital, although scores were reported arrested in protests in
most other cities.
   Many of those arrested were being released <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> after an
identity check, some without being charged and others cited to
appear before city judges.
   The national police said the dead included two boys, age 14 and
15, and an adult. It said 21 people were injured in the rioting.
   Pinochet, who commands the army, has led the military government
that has governed <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION> since <DATE>September 1973</DATE>, when the elected
government of Marxist President <PERSON>Salvador Allende</PERSON> was overthrown in
a bloody coup by the armed forces. Allende died in the coup.
   Pinochet was picked in a meeting with the chiefs of the <ORGANIZATION>navy</ORGANIZATION>,
air force and national police to be the sole candidate in an <DATE>Oct. 5</DATE>
presidential referendum.
   If a majority vote in his favor, he will assume a new eight-year
term on <DATE>March 11</DATE>. If voters reject him, he remains in power until
<DATE>1990</DATE> when an open presidential election is to be held in conjuction
with elections for a <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>.
   The nomination came despite appeals by the local Roman Catholic
church and several moderate political organizations for a candidate
who would have the backing of both the government and opposition.
   It also ended speculation that the other commanders, who had
publicly expressed support for a civilian nominee, would insist
that <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON> give up his army commandership in return for the
candidacy.
   The formal nomination declaration refers repeatedly to <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON>
as army leader and the army commander pointedly made his acceptance
speech in military uniform.
   He can legally remain army leader if he wins the referendum and
remains president.
   Opposition leaders, meanwhile, said that <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON>'s nomination
will backfire.
   `This confrontational decision directly compromises the armed
forces, who will suffer from his defeat in the plebescite,''
<PERSON>Patricio Aylwin</PERSON>, leader of the centrist <ORGANIZATION>Christian Democratic Party</ORGANIZATION>,
said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> of <LOCATION>Pinochet</LOCATION>'s selection.
   The opposition cites several opinion polls that give a 2-1
advantage to <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON> opponents in the ballot.
Government-contracted polls give him a slight edge in the vote.
   Speaking to foreign reporters, <PERSON>Aylwin</PERSON> said <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON>'s army
commandership ``acts as a kind of shield, and exerts moral pressure
on his institution.''
   ``Pinochet is too attached to power, and I don't believe he is
willing to give up any of his priveleges,'' he said.
   Aylwin described ``as generally peaceful'' <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>'s
anti-government protests, in which thousands of people
participated. But he said he expected that the incidents of
violence would be politically exploited by <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON>'s
administration.
   Interior Minister <PERSON>Sergio Fernandez</PERSON> issued a declaration
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE> that blamed the violence on the political opposition.
``Once again, extremist groups have sewed death and fear. Those
responsible for these acts are clearly identified with the
(supports of a) vote of `no.'
   Christian Democrat vice-president <PERSON>Andres Zaldivar</PERSON> said, however,
``The only violence occurred where there was police repression.''
Riot police squads had broken the demonstrations with tear gas and
water cannon.
   Aylwin described one of <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>'s falities, that of a
15-year-old boy, as ``one more youth added to the victims of the
dictatorship.'' The boy was participating in a pot-banging protest
when he was shot twice in the chest by gunmen in a passing car.
   A <DATE>1980</DATE> Constitution crafted by the <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON> government calls for
a phased return to democracy, including a resumption of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> in
<DATE>1990</DATE>. However, about a third of the senate would government
appointees and high-ranking military officials. The <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> also
   A declaration signed by leaders of a 16-party opposition
coalition <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> reaffirmed their plans to campaign for a vote
of ``no''in the referendum and, if they win, to negotiate with the
armed forces for constitutional changes.

<LEADPARA>  Agents of the 17-year military regime led by Gen. Augusto Pinochet killed
2,025 Chileans, according to a comprehensive report released Monday
chronicling human-rights abuses during the 1973-'90 rule of Pinochet. In
releasing the report, which was prepared during the last year by a blue-ribbon
commission, President Patricio Aylwin said in Santiago that there was no
justification for the killings and torture and said, "Justice demands . . .
the determination of the persons responsible.";    The report finds that
Salvador Allende, the Socialist president overthrown by Pinochet in a Sept.
11, 1973, coup, committed suicide inside the presidential palace as Pinochet's
forces were storming the gates. Opponents of the military regime insisted for
years that Allende had been slain, but the commission found that Allende shot
himself to honor a promise he made in his final radio address, to "repay the
loyalty of the people with my life."  </LEADPARA>

<HEAD>Returning Exiles Bring Support, Some Embarrassment To
Anti-Pinochet Forces</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Friday AMs report.</NOTE>

   Dozens of prominent leftists are
returning from exile to join the campaign against military
President <PERSON>Augusto Pinochet</PERSON>, but some are bringing embarrassment as
well as enthusiasm to the opposition.
   Police said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> that 53 of the 504 leftists affected by
<PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON>'s <DATE>Sept. 1</DATE> decision to end all official exile have returned
home.
   The list includes prominent members of the leftist government of
President <PERSON>Salvador Allende</PERSON>, ousted by <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON> in a bloody <DATE>1973</DATE>
coup, and leaders of Marxist parties that supported it.
   Most of the returning exiles have declared support for an
opposition campaign to defeat <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON> in an <DATE>Oct. 5</DATE> presidential
referendum. But some are also making radical statements that
conflict with the opposition's campaign strategy.
   In the referendum, 7.4 million registered voters will vote on a
proposal by the country's military commanders that <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON> remain
in power until <DATE>1997</DATE>.
   If a majority vote yes, <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON> will start a new eight-year
term next <DATE>March 11</DATE>. If the no vote prevails, an open election will
be called next year and <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON> will hand over power to the winner
in <DATE>1990</DATE>.
   A 16-party coalition is busily campaigning for <ORGANIZATION>Pinochet</ORGANIZATION>'s defeat.
   Images of joyful dissidents returning to their homeland after
more than a decade in exile have provided an emotional charge to
campaign.
   A huge airport crowd is expected <DATE>Saturday</DATE> for the scheduled
arrival of Allende's widow, <PERSON>Hortensia Bussi</PERSON>.
   Allende died in the takeover, and his wife fled the country days
later, emerging as a major critic of <LOCATION>Pinochet</LOCATION>. Her visit is
expected to give the opposition a major boost.
   But some of the exiles appear too outspoken for the moderate
opposition's tastes.
   <PERSON>Volodia Teitelboim</PERSON>, a former senator and a leader of the
proscribed <ORGANIZATION>Communist Party</ORGANIZATION>, returned on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> from exile in
<LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> and promptly criticized the opposition strategy.
   He said it lacks ``real unity'' because the Communists are
excluded from the coalition, whose members range from the
center-right to socialist left.
   He also criticized six parties from the right to the center-left
for joining in a coalition to form a moderate transition government
in case <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON> loses.
   The new coalition, announced <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> and led by the moderate
Christian Democratic party, the nation's largest, said its goal is
to offer Chileans ``an alternative of government for the first
democatic period'' after <PERSON>Pinochet</PERSON>.
   The opposition leaders have carefully avoided comment on the
remarks by <PERSON>Teitelboim</PERSON> and others.
   <PERSON>Patricio Aylwin</PERSON>, president of the Christian Democrats, asked
about <PERSON>Teitelboim</PERSON>'s criticism, replied only, ``the <ORGANIZATION>Communist Party</ORGANIZATION>
is not a member of our coalition.''
   <PERSON>Genaro Arriagada</PERSON>, secretary-general of the coalition, recently
defended the leftists' ``inalienable right'' to return to their
homeland when they chose, even if it might not be the best moment
for their arrival.
   ``We have no moral right to ask that they postpone their
return,'' he said at a news conference.
   Pro-government media are enthusiastically selecting and
broadcasting some statements by the returning exiles to emphasize
its claim that the opposition is dominated by the extreme left.
   When <PERSON>Mario Palestro</PERSON>, a radical Socialist ex-congressman,
returned to <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION> last week, he paid homage ``to my comrades'' of
the <ORGANIZATION>Leftist Revolutionary Movement</ORGANIZATION>, a guerrilla band. He warned
that, when ``the people'' recover power, many right-wingers will
have ``to flee the country like rabbits.''
   Since then, government political ads on television have
repeatedly shown Palestro making his fierce speech upon arrival at
the airport.
   <PERSON>Maria Eugenia Oyarzun</PERSON>, a pro-government political commentator,
said in the newspaper La Tercera last <DATE>Sunday</DATE> that the returning
exiles are ruining the opposition's efforts to cultivate an image
of moderation.
   Defense Minister Adm. <PERSON>Patricio Carvajal</PERSON> said on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>: ``I
think it's very good that these people are returning, so Chileans
can see the the continued disorder and split within the
opposition.''
