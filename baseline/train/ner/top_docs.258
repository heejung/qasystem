   With the flick of a tail and the
wave of a claw, two huge lobsters were freed <DATE>Monday</DATE> in the <LOCATION>Atlantic
Ocean</LOCATION>, safe from seafood lovers after a roundabout landlubbers tour
of the <ORGANIZATION>Northeast</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``<PERSON>Shirley</PERSON>,'' a 25-pound male lobster, and ``Bob,'' his 19}-pound
companion, went down into the sea off foggy <LOCATION>Portland</LOCATION> Head Light.
   They had apparently already been hearing the call of the wild
and snacked on seafood in the tank where they were being kept
before their release.
   ``They were real frisky,'' Marine Patrol Officer <PERSON>Donald K.
Lockhart Jr.</PERSON> said. ``They put a quahog (a large clam) in there and
the big one just snapped it up like it was butter. They left a crab
in there overnight and it was gone <TIME>this morning</TIME>.''
   The two behemoths almost became a very expensive Easter dinner
in <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> before an unlikely combination of animal rights
activists, seafood dealers and state officials came to the rescue.
   A 30-minute boat ride from <LOCATION>Portland</LOCATION> marked a storybook ending to
the rescue mission.
   <PERSON>Dana Neuts</PERSON>, retail manager of Harbor Fish Market in <LOCATION>Portland</LOCATION>,
and <PERSON>Kevin Hill</PERSON>, owner of <ORGANIZATION>Main Line Seafood Co.</ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION>
suburb of <LOCATION>Ardmore</LOCATION>, had the honor of putting the monster crustaceans
into the water.
   Neuts grabbed <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON>'s baseball mitt-sized claws and Hill took
the tail, and the two gently lowered the lobster over the side of
the 35-foot <ORGANIZATION>Maine Marine Patrol</ORGANIZATION> boat. Bob went into the same
protected cove moments later.
   The two men who make their living from selling seafood agreed it
seemed strange to be returning it to the sea, but in the case of
<PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> and Bob they had no complaints.
   ``It feels great. It really does,'' <PERSON>Neuts</PERSON> said. ``I like the
idea of the whole thing.''
   ``These are well-traveled lobsters,'' <PERSON>Hill</PERSON> said. With his wife,
<PERSON>Vickie</PERSON>, he accompanied the two lobsters on their flight <DATE>Monday</DATE> from
<LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Portland</LOCATION>.
   ``We shouldn't be catching lobsters this size. <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION> is the only
state that's doing anything to protect them, and that's why we're
here,'' <PERSON>Hill</PERSON> said.
   <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION> law protects lobsters with body shells longer than five
inches, covering crustaceans heavier than 4 to 5 pounds. It is the
only state with a legal limit on the maximum size of lobsters.
   Shirley, whose age has been estimated at 40 to 125 years old,
and the smaller companion were rescued from a <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> man who
wanted to serve them for Easter dinner.
   Col. <PERSON>Robert Fogg</PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION>Bureau of Marine Patrol</ORGANIZATION> of the
state <ORGANIZATION>Department of Marine Resources</ORGANIZATION>, said the lobsters had
apparently gotten snagged in the nets of a dragger and were landed
in <LOCATION>Rhode Island</LOCATION>.
   The lobsters had been trucked from <LOCATION>Long Island</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>, to Hill's
store, where retired carpenter Art <PERSON>Miller</PERSON> bought them for <MONEY>$287</MONEY>.
   After animal rights activists took up the lobsters' cause, Hill
persuaded <PERSON>Miller</PERSON> to take 45 pounds of smaller lobsters instead.
Pity <ORGANIZATION>Not Cruelty Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, an animal rights group, arranged to turn the
creatures loose and assumed the <MONEY>$40</MONEY> flight cost.

   ``<PERSON>Shirley</PERSON>,'' a 25-pound male
lobster with claws as big as baseball mitts, returned to the ocean
today, saved from a dinner plate by animal rights activists, a
seafood vendor and state officials.
   Lifting the giant crustacean by its claws and tail, seafood
dealers from <LOCATION>Portland</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> gently swung him over the
side of a <ORGANIZATION>Maine Marine Patrol</ORGANIZATION> boat into 22-feet-deep water near
fog-shrouded <LOCATION>Portland</LOCATION> Head Light in this <LOCATION>Portland</LOCATION> suburb.
   Bob, a companion lobster weighing in at 19} pounds, was dropped
into the water moments later.
   <PERSON>Dana Neuts</PERSON>, retail manager of Harbor Fish Market in <LOCATION>Portland</LOCATION>,
said he wasn't used to the idea of returning potential seafood to
the sea, but in the case of <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> and Bob he had no complaints.
   ``It feels great. It really does,'' <PERSON>Neuts</PERSON> said. ``I like the
idea of the whole thing.''
   ``These are well-traveled lobsters,'' said <PERSON>Kevin Hill</PERSON>, the
<LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> seafood vendor who accompanied <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> and Bob on
their flight to <LOCATION>Portland</LOCATION> on <DATE>Monday</DATE>. ``We shouldn't be catching
lobsters this size. <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION> is the only state that's doing anything
to protect them, and that's why we're here.''
   The two lobsters spent the night in a 12-by-4-foot tank in
Neuts' market along the <LOCATION>Portland</LOCATION> waterfront before being placed
aboard the 35-foot boat for the half-hour ride through choppy seas
to a protected cove off <LOCATION>Cape Elizabeth</LOCATION>.
   Shirley, whose age has been estimated at 40 to 125 years old,
and her smaller companion were rescued from a <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> man who
wanted to serve them for Easter dinner.
   ``This is symbolic of what we're trying to do and what citizens
are trying to do for a natural, sustainable resource,'' said Col.
<PERSON>Robert Fogg</PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION>Bureau of Marine Patrol</ORGANIZATION> of the state
<ORGANIZATION>Department of Marine Resources</ORGANIZATION>. ``By protecting these large
lobsters, there's more of a chance of them reproducing'' and
perpetuating the industry.
   ``It shows there's a lot of concern about our natural resources
out there,'' <PERSON>Fogg</PERSON> added.
   <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION> law protects lobsters with body shells longer than five
inches, covering crustaceans heavier than 4 to 5 pounds.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Marine Patrol</ORGANIZATION> said the two lobsters appeared to be in
``excellent'' shape after their flight and enjoyed a seafood dinner
in their tank at the <LOCATION>Portland</LOCATION> fish market.
   ``They were real frisky,'' said Officer <PERSON>Donald K. Lockhart Jr.</PERSON>
``They put a quahog in there and the big one just snapped it up
like it was butter. They left a crab in there overnight and it was
gone <TIME>this morning</TIME>.''
   The lobsters had been trucked from <LOCATION>Long Island</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>, to
<LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION>, where they were sold to a customer for <MONEY>$287</MONEY>.
   Animal rights activists took up the lobsters' cause when they
heard that Art <PERSON>Miller</PERSON>, a retired carpenter, planned to use them for
a feast.
   Hill, owner of <ORGANIZATION>Hill's Main Line Seafood Co.</ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION>
suburb of <LOCATION>Ardmore</LOCATION>, persuaded <PERSON>Miller</PERSON> to take 45 pounds of smaller
lobsters instead.
   Hill put the lobsters in a window tank for the rest of their
visit to <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION>'s Main Line, acknowledging that saving
lobsters from dinner was something new for him.
   ``It's been very good for business,'' he said. Thousands of
people dropped by for a look at <LOCATION>Shirley</LOCATION>. ``If they don't buy now,
at least they know where we are,'' said Hill.
   Pity <ORGANIZATION>Not Cruelty Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a small animal rights group, made
arrangements with <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION> officials to turn the creatures loose and
assumed the <MONEY>$40</MONEY> flight cost.
   It may seem a lot of trouble for a couple of lobsters, but group
vice president <ORGANIZATION>Gloria Felscher-Cohen</ORGANIZATION> makes no apologies.
   ``Why not?'' she asked. ``These two lobsters have survived
hazards, particularly <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON>, over 100 years. Why should she need
to succumb to the cruelest predator of all, man?''

<HEAD>Massive Lobster Gets Reprieve From Easter Dinner</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 25-pound lobster that nearly became
somebody's Easter dinner has been rescued and will be jetting to
<LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION> on <DATE>Monday</DATE> to live out its old age beneath the <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION>.
   Publicity forced a seafood company owner, a seafood lover, an
animal-rights group and the <ORGANIZATION>Maine Department of Marine Resources</ORGANIZATION>
into an unlikely alliance to save the creature, which was estimated
to be between 40 and 125 years old.
   Also saved from the pot was a 19}-pound companion.
   ``This was something that strikes you in your moral craw,'' said
<PERSON>Gloria Felscher-Cohen</PERSON>, vice president of the rights group, <ORGANIZATION>Pity Not
Cruelty Inc</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``Here is a very old lobster and it just seemed disgusting that
it should end its life to the cruelest predator _ man _ in a pot of
boiling water.''
   The 25-pounder, equipped with claws the size of baseball mitts,
arrived from <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> on <DATE>March 25</DATE> after an order got mixed up at
<ORGANIZATION>Hill's Main Line Seafood Co.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Ardmore</LOCATION>.
   When owner <PERSON>Kevin Hill</PERSON> recovered from his astonishment, he and
his staff dubbed her <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON>. Then he sold her and the other hefty
crustacean to a regular customer, a retired carpenter from
<LOCATION>Haverford</LOCATION>, for <MONEY>$287</MONEY>.
   But before <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> was out the door, The <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> Inquirer
ran a story about her, and <PERSON>Hill</PERSON>'s phone began ringing with calls
from lobster advocates, including <PERSON>Ms. Felscher-Cohen</PERSON>.
   She told him it would be a ``lovely gesture'' during the
Passover and Easter holidays to celebrate themes of freedom and
resurrection by buying back the lobsters.
   She even offered to top the carpenter's price.
   After several calls like that, Hill was convinced. When the
carpenter came to pick up the second lobster, Hill offered him <MONEY>$387</MONEY>
for both.
   ``His first feeling was `What do you mean they're going to take
the lobsters?''' Hill said.
   ``I said, `Look, there's too many people (calling). Let's free
the things.''
   The customer, <PERSON>Robert Miller</PERSON>, agreed to exchange the large
lobsters for 45 pounds of smaller ones, rather than for money.
   ``I think it's ridiculous,'' <PERSON>Miller</PERSON> said. ``What's the
difference between a one-pound lobster and a 25-pound lobster?''
   Pity Not Cruelty, meanwhile, had already made arrangements with
the state of <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION> to turn the creatures loose. The group assumed
the flight costs.
   Crated and covered with seaweed, the lobsters are due to fly to
<LOCATION>Portland</LOCATION> <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME> for a few hours of observation.
   ``If they are healthy, we will liberate them the <DATE>next day</DATE>,''
said Lt. <PERSON>Joseph Fessenden</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Maine Bureau of Marine Patrol</ORGANIZATION>.
   They should be freed off the shore of <LOCATION>Cape Elizabeth</LOCATION>, by the
<LOCATION>Portland</LOCATION> Head Light, he said.
   In <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION>, he added, it would be illegal to catch <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON>,
because she is much longer than the five-inch maximum (measured
from the rear of the eye socket to the end of the body shell)
allowed by the <ORGANIZATION>Maine Department of Natural Resources</ORGANIZATION>. The older
lobsters are protected, he said, because they have more offspring.
   His department will probably investigate <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON>'s origins, he
said.
   The state helped save a 23{-pound Alaskan lobster from gourmands
<DATE>last November</DATE>, he said.
   That lobster ``was very lively,'' he said. ``I'm pretty
optimistic that these will fare as well.''

<TEXT>     How long since you splurged on lobster at home? Have you ever?;   If the
answer is a long time or never, perhaps it was the cost or the logistics that
dissuaded you. But now is the time, because lobster season is in full swing.
Prices are as good as they're going to get. (This week, at selected <ORGANIZATION>Safeway</ORGANIZATION>
stores, live <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION> lobsters are selling for <MONEY>$4.98</MONEY> a pound.);   One-pound
lobsters, called chickens, are considered prime for individual servings of
whole lobster. Also desirable are 1 1/4-pounders, called quarters.;   And
following are Lobster Logistics: how to cook, crack and eat a lobster.;   To
cook lobster at home, try steaming instead of boiling. Maine lobster fishermen
prefer steaming because they say boiling can toughen the lobster and make the
meat soggy.;   Be prepared for an intense eating experience. In lobster
houses, bibs are standard equipment. Have lots of napkins on hand and be
prepared to eat with your fingers.;   How to steam a lobster;   Bring about an
inch of salted water to a boil in a pot large enough to hold lobsters. Place
lobsters (1 per serving) in pot, head first, and cover with lid. When water
returns to boil, add corn, allowing two ears for each serving. Steam lobsters
for 15 minutes, or until shells turn bright red and antennae pull out easily.
The corn should be done by then also. Serve with lots of melted butter.;   How
to eat lobsters;   First, twist off the large claws. Crack each claw with a
nutcracker, pliers, knife, hammer or rock. Separate the tail from the body by
arching the back until it cracks. Break off the tail flippers.;   Next, insert
a fork and push the tail meat out in one piece. Remove and discard the black
vein that runs the entire length of the tail.;   Then, unhinge the back shell
from the body. The green part in the body cavity is the "tomalley," which many
people consider the most delicious part of the lobster (it's the lobster's
liver -- some say it's not a good idea to eat more than one of these in a
day). The coral-colored roe is also edible.;   Finally, open the body by
cracking it apart sideways. Lobster meat lies in the four pockets (or joints)
where the small walking legs are attached. The small walking legs also contain
excellent meat that can be removed by sucking.;   <LOCATION>Trivia</LOCATION>;   From <PERSON>Ken Barnes</PERSON>,
captain of the schooner <PERSON>Stephen Taber</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Rockland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION>, who presides over a
weekly lobster roast for windjammer guests:;   "Lobsters' claws are bound with
rubber bands to keep them from hurting each other, not consumers. Because
lobsters are cannibalistic, their claws must be clamped shut to prevent them
from damaging each other during shipping.;   "The long narrow claw or 'thumb'
portion of each claw makes a perfect pick for getting to the meat in the body
and small walking legs of the lobster.";   From <PERSON>Peggy Dupont</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Massachusetts
Lobstermen</LOCATION>'s Association:;   "Treat lobsters humanely by putting them in a
'trance' before they go into the pot. Rub on the underside of the tail for 30
to 40 seconds. When the lobster goes limp, quickly plunge it into the boiling
water head first. Add lobsters one at a time after water returns to boil."  </TEXT>

   A 25-pound lobster with claws the size of
baseball mitts that was saved from becoming an Easter dinner
arrived in <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION> on <DATE>Monday</DATE> on the final leg of a roundabout journey
back to the sea.
   Maine marine officials gently placed ``<PERSON>Shirley</PERSON>,'' a male
estimated at 40 to 125 years, and a 19}-pound companion lobster
into a 600-gallon tub of icy saltwater after their flight from
<LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION>. Freed from their ice-packed travel boxes, the
lobsters immediately began moving their giant claws around.
   ``Very good, he's moving around already. That's a good sign,''
Col. <PERSON>Robert Fogg</PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION>Bureau of Marine Patrol</ORGANIZATION> of the <ORGANIZATION>Maine
Department of Marine Resources</ORGANIZATION>, said of <LOCATION>Shirley</LOCATION>. ``A real weak
lobster would be very lifeless.
   ``They're excellent. I'm pleased with the way they've shown up.''
   Marine officials planned to return the crustacean behemoths to
the <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> early <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> off <LOCATION>Cape Elizabeth</LOCATION> if they remained
healthly overnight.
   ``This is symbolic of what we're trying to do and what citizens
are trying to do for a natural, sustainable resource,'' <PERSON>Fogg</PERSON> said.
``By protecting these large lobsters, there's more of a chance of
them reproducing'' and perpetuating the industry.
   <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION> law protects lobsters with body shells longer than five
inches, covering lobsters larger than 4 to 5 pounds.
   If the lobsters' health deteriorated during the night and they
could not be saved, Lt. <PERSON>Joseph Fessenden</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Maine Bureau of
Marine Patrol</ORGANIZATION> said the largest would be turned over to the <ORGANIZATION>Maine
State Museum</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``They're looking for a lobster to stuff,'' he said.
   Shirley and the companion lobster had been trucked to
<LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> from <LOCATION>Long Island</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>, and sold for <MONEY>$287</MONEY>. After
crustacean rights advocates took up the cause, <PERSON>Kevin Hill</PERSON>, owner of
<ORGANIZATION>Hill's Main Line Seafood Co.</ORGANIZATION> in the suburb of <LOCATION>Ardmore</LOCATION>, persuaded
the buyer to take 45 pounds of smaller lobsters instead.
   Hill put the lobsters in a window tank for the rest of their
visit to <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION>'s Main Line. He acknowledged that saving
lobsters from dinner palates was something new for him, ``which is
all right.''
   He also said that the lobsters had been good business, as
thousands of peole dropped by for a look at <LOCATION>Shirley</LOCATION>.
   ``It's been very good for business. If they don't buy now, at
least they know where we are,'' said Hill, who planned to travel to
<LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION> to be on hand for the lobsters' release into the <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION>.
   Hill delayed packing the lobsters for their trip until the last
possible minute. ``Believe it or not, I'm still getting people
coming by the window to look at 'em,'' he said <DATE>Monday</DATE>.
   Pity <ORGANIZATION>Not Cruelty Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a small animal rights group, made
arrangements with <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION> officials to turn the creatures loose and
assumed the <MONEY>$40</MONEY> flight cost.
   If it seems to be a lot of fuss over a couple of lobsters, group

   ``Why not? These two lobsters have survived hazards,

   Animal rights activists on <DATE>Friday</DATE> spent <MONEY>$240</MONEY> to
buy seven live lobsters from a suburban <LOCATION>Maryland</LOCATION> restaurant and fly
them to a new home off the coast of <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION>.
   Cam <ORGANIZATION>McQueen of People</ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION>Ethical Treatment of Animals</ORGANIZATION> picked
up the lobsters from the <ORGANIZATION>House of Chinese Gourmet</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Rockville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Md.</LOCATION>,
about <TIME>10 a.m.</TIME>, took them to <LOCATION>Washington National Airport</LOCATION> and boarded
a flight to <LOCATION>Portland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION>, a PETA official said.
   Members of the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Coast Guard</ORGANIZATION> then were expected to escort her
and the lobsters to a boat station to release the creatures into
their new ocean home, <ORGANIZATION>PETA</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON>Victoria Thomas</PERSON> said.
   The <ORGANIZATION>House of Chinese Gourmet</ORGANIZATION> is popular among local vegetarians
who were offended when owner <PERSON>Jack Sun</PERSON> introduced the lobster tank
about a month ago, <PERSON>Ms. Thomas</PERSON> said.
   ``All of the sudden they put up a 125-gallon tank with live
lobsters, and there was a big outcry,'' she said. ``All their
vegetarian clientele got very upset.''
   Sun agreed to get rid of the lobster tank, <PERSON>Ms. Thomas</PERSON> said,
provided the animal activists bought the lobsters and arranged for
their freedom. The total cost of the lobster rescue was <MONEY>$240</MONEY> _ <MONEY>$40</MONEY>
for the lobsters and <MONEY>$200</MONEY> for the flight. The <ORGANIZATION>Coast Guard</ORGANIZATION> donated
its services.
   <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION> is noted for its prime lobster growing areas.
   ``The water is cooler, and lobsters prefer that,'' <PERSON>Ms. Thomas</PERSON>
said.
   <PERSON>Ms. Thomas</PERSON> said there were no plans to free lobsters waiting to

FT  08 OCT 94 / Food and Drink: First, catch your (Maine) lobster . . . -
Eating out / Nicholas Woodsworth's worthwhile struggle with steaming
crustaceans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS WOODSWORTH

<TEXT>
Lobsters, I decided sitting back one evening and surveying my shell-strewn,
butter-spattered table at the <ORGANIZATION>Dolphin Marina Restaurant</ORGANIZATION>, are hard work.
I should have guessed as much when they began handing out foul-weather gear.
Disposable plastic bibs are de rigueur for lobster-eaters in even the more
sophisticated seafood establishments in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> - in some places motherly
waitresses will tie them on for you.
Then came the specialised equipment - the pincers for cracking claws, the
long skewers for probing recessed corners, the bowls for rinsing. It was all
new to me. I felt like a trainee dentist.
And what about the vast expertise required? How much experience, how many
botched jobs does it take before the seasoned lobsterer can artfully
dismember this complex little crustacean? I watched one man at the table
beside me deftly remove the meat from his lobster's tail with one clean
pull. There was hardly a drop of juice splattered on his bib. My own chest
looked like a <PERSON>Jackson Pollock</PERSON> painting. You could have made Thermidor with
what lay in my lap.
And is it, in the end, worth it? After the first bite I could only say yes,
it most certainly is. But lobsters, sadly, do not come cheap. Here, on the
<LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION> coast, home of what are said to be the best cold-water lobsters in the
world, the pound-and-a-half beast I had just consumed cost Dollars 20. Try
eating the same creature in some up-scale restaurant in a western European
capital, though, and you might have to pay for it by instalments. All in
all, I decided, the lobster-lover's lot is a hard one.
'Just about as tough eating a lobster as it is catching one,' I remarked to
the young waitress who, as I mopped melted butter from my eyebrows, had
begun cleaning up the battlefield in front of me. It was only the happy
prattle that comes after a good dinner, of course, but she seemed to take it
literally.
She looked at me, looked out the window at a wind-whipped sea and boats
tossing at their moorings, then back at me again.
'Get real, will ya?' she said.
I decided, the very next day, to get real. My waitress had been right - much
as I liked lobster, I hadn't the faintest idea of how easy or difficult it
was to catch one. All I knew was that they were lured into large crate-like
traps. But no one visiting <LOCATION>Casco Bay</LOCATION>, east of <LOCATION>Portland</LOCATION>, could avoid knowing
that; most people here make their living from lobstering and traps sit in
every backyard and on every wharf in sight. It should not be too difficult,
I thought, to get as close to a snapping live lobster as a steaming red one.
On <PERSON>Cook</PERSON>'s wharf, 20 minutes drive from the Dolphin Restaurant on <PERSON>Orr</PERSON>'s
<LOCATION>Island</LOCATION>, I came across hundreds of lobsters scuttling about the bottom of a
large holding tank. More importantly, I came across <PERSON>Ernest Hillman</PERSON>, the man
who caught them, and the <PERSON>Franny Ellen</PERSON>, the 36-ft lobster-boat he caught them
from.
<PERSON>Hillman</PERSON> was refuelling at the wharf's diesel pumps before heading out to
pull up 400 traps he had laid in 80 separate strings two days before. I
explained my interest in lobsters - not the ones already swimming in butter
but those still crawling about on the bottom of <ORGANIZATION>Harpswell Sound</ORGANIZATION>, the broad
<LOCATION>Casco Bay</LOCATION> channel that stretched away in front of us. Could I come along, I
asked? Why not, replied <PERSON>Hillman</PERSON>, he had something to tell me.
We shoved off with <PERSON>Hillman</PERSON> at the wheel and his two deckhands, <PERSON>Joe</PERSON> and
<PERSON>Chris</PERSON>, sorting out cases of baitfish in the stern. A purpose-built
lobster-boat, the <ORGANIZATION>Franny Ellen</ORGANIZATION> carries a large tank of pump-circulated
sea-water and a platform for traps on her aft deck; there is not much
working space left over.
'Better ride with me in the wheel-house', <PERSON>Hillman</PERSON> warned as we headed into
the sound. 'Once the ropes start paying out it gets kind of hairy back there
 -you get your foot caught in a coil of rope and all of a sudden you'll find
yourself being dragged 80ft down on a string of traps. We lose one or two
men that way every year.' I rode, very happily, in the wheelhouse.
For a layman like me it was a perfect day; the wind of the previous evening
had dropped and we cruised out into a sunny, calm, scintillatingly clear
autumn morning. In this weather the thousands of coloured lobster buoys that
cluttered the sound - each one marking the beginning or end of a string of
traps - stood out brightly against the deep blue water.
For a lobsterman like <PERSON>Hillman</PERSON>, though, the day was less than perfect. It was
full moon, he explained, a phase that created huge tides rising and falling
more than 15 feet in <LOCATION>Casco Bay</LOCATION>. With strong currents like that running, he
said, lobsters tend not to wander round in search of food but to stay put in
holes and depressions on the floor.
We came to a floating buoy marking one of <PERSON>Hillman</PERSON>'s strings. His buoys are
black and orange, the other 30 or so lobstermen he fishes <LOCATION>Harpswell</LOCATION> Sound
with having their own colour combinations. Nonetheless, with some 12,000
traps out in the sound, locating one's own dispersed strings in this
multi-coloured maze - and not tangling them up with a neighbour's  -
requires a prodigious memory and skill.
The first string, as <PERSON>Hillman</PERSON> predicted, was disappointing. Winding the rope
attached to his bouy around a hydraulic winch, he began hauling in his
string of five traps. Each held three or four antenna-weaving,
tail-flapping, greeny-brown camouflaged lobsters; all but one, however, had
to be thrown back.
'Too small', <PERSON>Hillman</PERSON> explained, measuring each carefully with a brass
lobster gauge. Take anything measuring less than 3 1/4 in from eye to end of
body carapace and you loose your licence for three years. Take a female with
eggs and you are in real trouble. For every 100 lobsters I catch I keep only
about 20.'
As <PERSON>Hillman</PERSON> hauled traps, <PERSON>Joe</PERSON> rebaited them, sewing in two or three bait-fish
carefully trussed in nylon mesh. While the quaint lobster pots of the past -
knotted cord mounted on light frames of steamed wood - have long been
replaced by metal traps, the principle remains the same: lured by a
decomposing fish, the victim makes his way through a progressively smaller
aperture until, once inside, he cannot find his way out.
I began to understand <PERSON>Hillman</PERSON>'s warning after <PERSON>Chris</PERSON> had all five rebaited
traps lined up on the <ORGANIZATION>Franny Ellen</ORGANIZATION>'s stern. As he threw the first one
overboard <PERSON>Hillman</PERSON> hit the gas and 600 feet of rope and 75lb traps began
paying out at high speed. When you have to haul anything up to 750 traps a
day you do not waste time.
As he worked, <PERSON>Hillman</PERSON> talked. He is the quintessential Yankee Down-easter -
tough, resilient, enterprising and hard-working. He grew up on <LOCATION>Casco Bay</LOCATION> and
began lobster-fishing when he was 12 years old. In the <DATE>1970s</DATE> a hurricane
sank his boat and he had to fight hard to get back into what is an expensive
business - a lobster-boat these days costs upward of Dollars 60,000, a
single trap Dollars 75. But <PERSON>Hillman</PERSON> loves boats and fishing; they are only
thing he knows.
He surprised me, then, by asking if I wouldn't like to become the owner of
the <ORGANIZATION>Franny Ellen</ORGANIZATION> and all the gear that goes with her. I would not even have
to buy her. All I would have to do was win her.
Why? I asked. Six months ago, it turned out, a pile of lobster traps fell on
<PERSON>Hillman</PERSON>, damaging his spine and injuring an arm. He is fast reaching the end
of his trap-hauling days. When he put the <PERSON>Franny Ellen</PERSON> up for sale he
received a number of offers from young fishermen, deckhands wanting to start
up on their own. But lobster-fishing is a risky business: while some
skippers are in the six-figure income bracket, many more go bankrupt. None
of <PERSON>Hillman</PERSON>'s prospective buyers could come up with the bank loans they
needed.
Hillman's solution? He has set up an essay competition. If he can attract
2,000 contestants each paying an entrance fee of Dollars 50, he says, he can
recoup the value of his business. He walks away with the entry money, and
the writer of the best essay, to be independently judged, walks away with
his boat, 750 traps and 14 miles of rope. The essay topic? Fishing, of
course - 250 words of finely-honed prose on <PERSON>Ernest Hillman</PERSON>'s favourite
subject.
The morning wore on and slowly the tank on the <ORGANIZATION>Franny Ellen</ORGANIZATION>'s deck filled
with lobsters. In the end it turned out to be not too bad a catch: at <ORGANIZATION>Cook</ORGANIZATION>'s
wharf we off-loaded about 300 of the little brutes, each with their claws
carefully strapped tight with a pair of bright yellow elastic bands.
Later, flying home, I day-dreamed about those lobsters. I had no difficulty
imagining them flying off, like me, to distant destinations. In my mind's
eye I could see them roaming about restaurant display tanks in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>,
diving into boiling vats of water in <LOCATION>Rome</LOCATION>, swimming through Newburg sauce on
dinner plates in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>. And, if I closed my eyes and thought very hard
indeed, I could see them in a trap on the deck of my very own lobster boat
in <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION>.
Readers interested in <PERSON>Ernest Hillman</PERSON>'s essay contest may contact him on tel:
(207) 833 6010 or fax (207) 833 5956. Deadline for essay entries must be
postmarked on or before <DATE>October 15</DATE>.

<HL> The Lobster Clause Stirs Lots of Debate Over a Steamy Topic --- U.S. Lobstermen Seek a Ban On Imports of 'Immature' Crustaceans From Canada </HL>

<TEXT>
   Some Canadians and <LOCATION>New Englanders</LOCATION> are getting pretty steamed these days -- about lobsters. 

   The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> recently hammered out a new pact designed to promote freer trade between the countries. 
Now, as the proposed agreement awaits approval from <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>, a dispute has erupted over little lobsters. 
To be precise, Canadian lobsters measuring less than 3 7/32 inches from their eyes to the ends of their body shells, not including claws or tails. 

   "This isn't a joke," insists <PERSON>Sen. George Mitchell</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION>, who is leading the fight against the foreign crustaceans. 
Says <PERSON>Edward Blackmore</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Maine Lobstermen's Association</ORGANIZATION>: "I'm sure a lot of people out there equate lobsters with a luxury kind of thing, and can't get too worked up" over the topic. 

   But <LOCATION>New England</LOCATION> lobstermen can. 
They are seeking a ban on importing the little lobsters. 
Conservation laws prohibit American lobstermen from harvesting lobsters of less than a certain length in order to allow the crustaceans to mature and reproduce. 
Canadian laws are more lenient, allowing fishermen to catch smaller lobsters, some of which they export to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> 
In fact, Canadians have captured half of the <MONEY>$731 million</MONEY> <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> lobster market. 

   American lobstermen are boiling mad. 
The Canadians are undermining conservation efforts and depleting the lobster population, the lobstermen say. 
Besides, they argue, if left alone, many of <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>'s little lobsters would migrate south and grow up to be an ideal catch for any New Englander. 

   Nonsense, say the Canadians. 
An embassy official says the American lobstermen's efforts are "totally inappropriate" to the spirit of the free-trade agreement. 
The <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> administration also has cut the lobstermen adrift, saying the group's motivation in seeking the ban is protectionism. 
The agreement -- minus the lobster clause -- is likely to pass the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> today. 
But the lobstermen say they'll press on. 

   (The lobstermen also are seeking to bar imports of "berried," or pregnant, lobsters, or "scrubbed" lobsters that show evidence of eggs having been removed.) 

   Administration trade officials have tried several maneuvers to derail the lobstermen. 
First, they questioned whether lobsters migrate. 
The <LOCATION>New Englanders</LOCATION> fought back with studies that suggest they do. 
Then a trade official suggested the ultimate insult: Canadian lobsters mature and become sexually active at smaller sizes than lobsters that live in the warmer waters off <LOCATION>New England</LOCATION>. 

   Trade officials also tried to butter up <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION> interests by including in the trade pact a provision that would benefit potato farmers. 
To that, <PERSON>Sen. Mitchell</PERSON> retorts: "What's a potato without a lobster?" 

   American lobstermen are putting their faith in politics. 
They have high hopes for help from Vice President <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON>, who they think is sympathetic to their cause. 
<PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON> recently assured the lobstermen that, if elected president, he'll still permit them to trap in the waters off his compound in <LOCATION>Kennebunkport</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION>, despite possible <ORGANIZATION>Secret Service</ORGANIZATION> objections. 
"<PERSON>Bush</PERSON> understands," says <PERSON>Robert Brown</PERSON>, the president of <ORGANIZATION>Lusty Lobster</ORGANIZATION>, a lobster-supply business in <LOCATION>South Portland</LOCATION>. 

   In fact, the lobstermen figure they can't lose in this <DATE>fall</DATE>'s election. 
"Gov. 
<PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON> knows a lot of lobsters are caught in <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION>," <PERSON>Mr. Brown</PERSON> says.

<TEXT>
   Maine lobstermen are laying three times as
much bait and scientists have even tried raising lobster larvae in
test tanks, but the harvest of the tasty crustaceans hasn't
increased in 20 years.
   Marine biologists from the <ORGANIZATION>University of Maine</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Bigelow
Laboratory</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>West Boothbay</LOCATION> are conducting a 10-day research cruise
next month, and hope their detailed probe of breeding grounds will
help explain the inability of lobstermen to increase the annual
catch.
   The lobstermen, some of whom have volunteered to assist
biologists as they map the ocean floor, are hoping the investigation
will lead to bigger catches.
   Lobster production is vital to <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION>'s economy, not least because
of its contribution to tourism.
   ``We want to make sure that resource is around a thousand years
from now. It's so much a part of our income, our history and our
art, it's just incredibly important to us,'' said <PERSON>Dave Dow</PERSON>, director
of the <ORGANIZATION>Lobster Institute</ORGANIZATION>, a trade organization affiliated with the
<ORGANIZATION>University of Maine</ORGANIZATION>.
   The harvest of the ``bugs,'' as they are affectionately called by
lobstermen, has remained at about <MONEY>21 million pounds</MONEY> per year during
the past two decades, despite legal, scientific, and practical
measures to increase it.
   Biologists at the <ORGANIZATION>Cutler Marine Hatchery</ORGANIZATION> have coaxed thousands of
lobster eggs to grow at a quickened rate in warm-water tanks and
then stocked coastal waters with the immature larvae.
   State legislators have gradually increased the minimum size
limit, hoping more females would mature and reproduce.
   And lobstermen have worked harder; they haul about triple the
number of traps they put out 20 years ago. But the lobsters have
refused to take the extra bait, according to the <ORGANIZATION>Lobster Institute</ORGANIZATION>.
   In next month's cruise, five scientists aboard the research
vessel Argo <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION> will survey four major lobstering sites in the
<LOCATION>Gulf of Maine</LOCATION>.
   They will use sonar to determine the sea bottom's
characteristics; search for and count larval lobsters; scuba dive to
survey lobster densities, shelter sizes and abundance of predators;
and sample ocean bottom sediment for invertebrates.
   The investigation could affect where lobstermen set their traps,
as well as plans to stock coastal waters, said <PERSON>Dave Cousins</PERSON>, a
lobsterman from <LOCATION>South Thomaston</LOCATION>, 75 miles northeast of <LOCATION>Portland</LOCATION>.
   University of <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION> marine biologist <PERSON>Robert Steneck</PERSON>, one of the
project leaders, has sought for eight years to explain the static
harvest.
   ``His theory operates on the premise that something in nature
limits our productivity out there,'' Dow said.
   The limiting factor could be the amount of suitable habitat the
lobsters can live in, the amount of food available for the
creatures, or the ecological balance of lobsters and their
predators, <ORGANIZATION>Dow</ORGANIZATION> said.
   The lobsters go through three planktonic, or swimming stages,
before they are ready to settle on the sea bottom, and the suitable
bottom habitat is distributed in patches along the shoreline.
   ``If Mother Nature, because of the way she works the tides and
currents, doesn't allow delivery to the appropriate habitats, that's
going to be important for the overall production,'' Dow said.
   The public's appetite for lobster is matched by the appetites of
various marine creatures, he said.
   ``There's a million lobster-seeking missiles waiting for those
little fellows to hit the bottom ... these little fellows are
subject to thousands of attacks a day.''
   Large codfish have been found to contain up to a dozen lobsters
when they are cut open, <ORGANIZATION>Dow</ORGANIZATION> said.

"Try not to touch his eyeball," Cosgrove-Wake said. "Would you want anybody 
touching your eyeball?" 
</P>
<P>
She pointed to the lobster's antennae. 
</P>
<P>
"They give him information," she said. "And his eyes, they look like a bug's 
because he is related to a bug." 
</P>
<P>
Cosgrove-Wake, a marine biologist, is the driver and lecturer of the <ORGANIZATION>Orange 
County Marine Institute</ORGANIZATION>'s traveling road show, Ocean in Motion. Out of a 
strategically loaded, new blue van, Cosgrove-Wake travels to schools all over 
the county offering a hands-on experience with live marine life. Joining the 
lobster on the traveling team is an octopus, a jar full of mussels, a sea star, 
oysters, clams and a sea urchin, among other creatures. The live lobster rides 
in a temperature controlled fiberglass aquarium custom made for the van by 
<ORGANIZATION>Cosgrove-Wake</ORGANIZATION>'s husband, <PERSON>John Wake</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
The van also carries an assortment of shells, sand dollars, coral and other 
skeletal forms of marine life. The children listen for the sounds of the ocean 
and try to match the shells with a chart that identifies them. 
</P>
<P>
"We try to expose the children to a broader spectrum of their environment," 
Cosgrove-Wake said. "There's a living ocean out there they need to be aware of. 
We also try to instill a sense of conservation and preservation of the ocean." 
</P>
<P>
The alert, twitching <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> spiny lobster always wins lots of attention, 
Cosgrove-Wake said. The students learn that he doesn't have claws like his 
cousin from <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION>, the family member sometimes offered in upscale restaurants; 
that his tail can propel him backwards to escape dangers; that like his other 
cousins, the bugs, he's a scavenger on the ocean floor, and that because his 
flaps on his tail don't overlap, he is a he and not a she. 
</P>
<P>
Real live creatures such as the lobster can spark a fascination that may 
overcome what is, for many children, a dreaded word -- science. 
</P>
<P>
"I always tell the children right away, 'This is science,' " Cosgrove-Wake 
said. "I'm trying to bring science back into the classroom. I tell them that we 
have to understand science and that it is our real world. If I can influence 
just one child that if we don't protect our environment we'll lose everything 
that we have, (the class) is successful." 
</P>
<P>
For some in <PERSON>Clark</PERSON>'s class at <LOCATION>Jackson School</LOCATION>, this was their first experience 
with sea creatures. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of these kids have never been to the beach," said <PERSON>Gloria Roelen</PERSON>, 
principal of the 1,197-student school. The student enrollment is about <PERCENT>75%</PERCENT> 
Latino, <PERCENT>17%</PERCENT> Asian, and the remainder a mixture of ethnicities. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of their parents might work <DATE>Saturdays</DATE> and <DATE>Sundays</DATE>, possibly they don't 
have transportation or they might not feel comfortable venturing out," <PERSON>Roelen</PERSON> 
said. "Many of the parents don't speak English." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Clark</PERSON>'s class, made up of a combination second- and third-graders, is called 
"immersion English," in which the students are learning the English language as 
well as the customs of what, in many cases, is their new country. Part of that 
process is hands-on experiences such as the lessons taught by <ORGANIZATION>Ocean in Motion</ORGANIZATION>, 
<PERSON>Roelen</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
"The most important thing -- look at them -- is that they're learning and 
having fun doing it," <PERSON>Roelen</PERSON> said. "They're involved in the learning process 
and it's not someone dictating to them." 
</P>
<P>
Cosgrove-Wake travels from campus to campus, giving lectures at assemblies, 
talking to high school, junior high and grade school students. Wherever she 
goes, her family of creatures, especially the lobster, draws a crowd. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I feel like the Pied Piper," she said. LEN HALL)

   When it comes to license plates, <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION> has always kept a fairly low profile. 
No dramatics like <ORGANIZATION>New Hampshire</ORGANIZATION> ("Live Free or Die"); no wishful thinking like <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> ("The Garden State"). 
Just a simple black and white plate with the words "<LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION>" and "Vacationland." 

   Last year, however, the state enacted a law that -- beginning <DATE>July 1</DATE> -- will force drivers to trade in the simple for the sublime: a new license plate in blue and white trim that features a bright red lobster. 

   And now, some normally reserved Mainers -- including lots of school children -- are boiling. 

   It seems that quite a few residents are having second thoughts about riding around with a lobster on their tail. 
"I am receiving letters from people all over the state," says Rep. <PERSON>Mary McBride</PERSON>, who is sponsoring a bill to give drivers a choice of license plates. 
"I didn't realize this was going to be such an emotional issue." 

   The children, however, are angry for the opposite reason: It was their idea to put lobsters on licenses in the first place. 
What began as a civics project in <DATE>1983</DATE> in a fourth-grade class in <LOCATION>Kennebunk</LOCATION> ended up as a statewide campaign to add a little flavor to <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION>'s auto tags. 
With children crowding their chamber, legislators approved the change by a vote of 156-5. 

   Revising the law now would be a blow to the students, says <PERSON>Peter Towne</PERSON>, the teacher who started the whole thing. 
"The governor came down and signed the bill, and all the kids said, 'Boy, this is going to be on Dad's plate,'" he says. 
"The kids are a little upset." 

   Not surprisingly, the children are getting moral support from the state's lobstermen, who oppose any plans to give drivers a choice of plates, says <PERSON>Edward A. Blackmore</PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION>Maine Lobstermen's Association</ORGANIZATION>. 
"If you don't like it, don't look at it," he says. 

   Those on the other side of the fence include animal-rights activists and vegetarians -- who note that lobsters are red only after they've been cooked -- and residents who would like to see license plates with a pine tree, a lighthouse, a potato, or even marine worms (a big industry in <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION>). 
Anything but a lobster. 

   <LOCATION>Portland</LOCATION> housewife <PERSON>Gayle Drummond</PERSON>, for example, says she is outraged by the legislature's capitulation to the students. 

   "You want to cheer kids on so they grow and learn," she says. 
"But this is like a cheap souvenir of <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION> . . . . 
It's more like <LOCATION>Atlantic City</LOCATION> than <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION>."

   Every year, a few lobstermen find a freak
when they haul in their traps - a lobster with a shell as blue as
the <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION> sky.
   And they'll often call <PERSON>Sam Chapman</PERSON>, the godfather of blue
lobsters in <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION>. He has about 400, ranging in hue from powder
blue to electric cobalt blue to ``a blue so dark it's almost
black.''
   Most lobsters plucked from the <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION>'s icy waters are a
mottled mixture of green, red and brown. They turn bright red when
they're cooked.
   Blue lobsters are genetic mutations in which the crustacean's
blue gene is dominant. About one in every 3 million or 4 million
lobsters caught along the <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION> coast is blue, <PERSON>Chapman</PERSON> said.
   ``Lobsters have genes for the production of red, yellow and
blue,'' said <PERSON>Chapman</PERSON>, an aquaculture specialist at the <ORGANIZATION>University
of Maine</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Darling Marine Center</ORGANIZATION>. ``If the gene for red and the
gene for yellow aren't functioning, you get a blue lobster.''
   The disorder also produces lobsters with yellow shells, red
shells and even yellow with black spots, known as calico lobsters.
   Chapman has been raising blue lobsters since <DATE>1982</DATE> in a study to
determine if <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION>'s fishing grounds can be restocked with lobsters
raised in hatcheries.
   Hatcheries have operated in <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION> off and on for decades. But
<PERSON>Chapman</PERSON> said no one has ever proved that restocking coastal waters
increases the number of lobsters in the ocean.
   Part of the problem is that hatchery-raised lobsters are
released when they're the size of a thumbnail and hard to tag for
later identification.
   So with the blue lobster, <PERSON>Chapman</PERSON> said, ``what you have is
essentially a colored tag.''
   ``You can do all of the plot sampling and research that you
want, but the proof of the pudding in this whole program is how
many blue lobsters show up in traps'' over the next five years, he
said.
   It took from <DATE>1982</DATE> - when he collected <PERSON>Amanda</PERSON> and <PERSON>Vinnie</PERSON>, the
first two blues he bred - until the <DATE>summer of 1988</DATE> to raise enough
blue lobsters to get started.
   In <DATE>June</DATE> and <DATE>July 1988</DATE>, <PERSON>Chapman</PERSON> and another <ORGANIZATION>University of Maine</ORGANIZATION>
researcher released 5,600 blue lobsters off <LOCATION>Boothbay Harbor</LOCATION>. In
<DATE>1989</DATE>, they sampled the area and found two blues. But sampling this
past <DATE>summer</DATE> turned up none.
   Chapman released 1,100 blue lobsters in <LOCATION>Pemaquid Harbor</LOCATION> this
past <DATE>summer</DATE> and 1,500 in <LOCATION>Cutler Harbor</LOCATION>.
   He thinks the latest restocking will be easier to monitor
because Pemaquid and <PERSON>Cutler</PERSON> are sheltered harbors. ``My feeling is
somewhere between three and four years after you let them go,
they'll start showing up in traps,'' <PERSON>Chapman</PERSON> said.
   He also has kept about 375 blue lobsters for behavior testing.
They're living in rows of cages in his laboratory, each 2 years
old, 3 to 4 inches long and bright blue.
   In addition, <PERSON>Chapman</PERSON> has older, larger blues that have been
donated over the years by lobstermen. He fetched two for a
photographer - a 1&rsqb; pounder that is 8 years old and a 2{ pounder
that is about 10 years old.
   ``An obvious question is do blue lobsters survive at the same
rate as regular lobsters do? What we need to know is do they behave
the same when they're introduced to the ocean bottom.'' he said.
   To answer those questions, he has begun studies to see how blue
lobsters behave when introduced to different environments with and
without the presence of predators.
   <PERSON>David Dow</PERSON>, a former lobsterman and executive director of the
<ORGANIZATION>Maine Lobster Institute</ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Maine</ORGANIZATION>, thinks
<PERSON>Chapman</PERSON>'s work could be important for the future of the industry.
   ``We don't know how long our production is going to last,'' he
said. ``Ten years down the road, we might not have as large a
supply. Or 10 years down the road, if we do our homework and expand
our markets, we might want to increase our supply.''
   <PERSON>Anthony D'Agostino</PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION>Montauk Marine Science
Institute</ORGANIZATION> on <LOCATION>Long Island</LOCATION>, said <PERSON>Chapman</PERSON>'s project seemed
``worthwhile.''
   ``I just wonder if he has enough funding to do it properly,''
said <PERSON>D'Agostino</PERSON>, who has been studying lobsters since <DATE>1975</DATE>.
   Chapman's funding is slight - he started with <MONEY>$7,000</MONEY> from the
<ORGANIZATION>Lobster Advisory Council</ORGANIZATION> and keeps going with a yearly stipend of
about <MONEY>$600</MONEY> from the <ORGANIZATION>Maine Lobstermen's Association</ORGANIZATION>.
   For all <PERSON>Chapman</PERSON>'s work, however, he can't answer the key
question on every lobster-lover's mind - do blues taste the same?
   ``Everyone asks that question,'' <PERSON>Chapman</PERSON> said. ``The problem is
we've never had enough to be able to eat any. So I don't know. I've
never eaten a blue lobster.''

   When it's sitting on a plate, all red and steaming, who thinks about anything besides cracking it open and sousing its meat in melted butter? 
But after the debris has been cleared away you may begin to wonder. 
How did that ungainly, overarmed lobster get from the bottom of the sea to the pot in the kitchen? 
Who caught it, who bought it, and how is the handsome sum you paid for dinner being divided? 

   "The Lobster Gangs of <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION>," by <PERSON>James M. Acheson</PERSON> (<ORGANIZATION>University Press of New England</ORGANIZATION>, 181 pages, <MONEY>$20</MONEY> cloth, <MONEY>$9.95</MONEY> paper) answers these and a host of other questions about the livelihood of lobstering. 

   The American lobster is found from <LOCATION>Newfoundland</LOCATION> to the <LOCATION>Carolinas</LOCATION>, but the heart of its territory lies in the <LOCATION>Gulf of Maine</LOCATION>. 
These waters are full of the fish, mollusks and small crustaceans that lobsters like to eat. 
A rocky bottom and extensive kelp beds provide plenty of shelter. 
Finally, the mean annual temperature in the <LOCATION>Gulf of Maine</LOCATION> is about 50 degrees -- not great for swimming, but perfect for lobsters. 

   Lobsters are caught in traps or "pots," wooden or metal mesh boxes three to four feet long, two feet wide, and about 16 inches high. 
The traps are baited with herring or fish heads (which smell good to a lobster) and are attached, usually in pairs, to a brightly painted styrofoam buoy by a long nylon rope. 

   A typical lobster boat is about 35 feet long, with a high bow and a low, square stern. 
Routines vary, but usually two men fish together, hauling about 500 traps in a two- or three-day cycle. 
The men hook a buoy, haul the pots with a hydraulic winch, empty and rebait their traps, and drop them back onto the ocean floor. 
Captured lobsters are measured and checked for eggs (egg-bearing females cannot be taken); legal lobsters are pegged or banded to immobilize their claws and tossed into a holding tank. 
At the end of the day the catch is crated, weighed and sold to a cooperative or dealer for whatever price is posted. 

   Although this book tells a lot about lobsters and lobstering, it is primarily about the men who fish for them. (Women hold <PERCENT>9%</PERCENT> of <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION>'s 9,000 lobster licenses, but only a few are among the state's 2,200 fulltime fishers.) 
Like ranchers and farmers, each lobsterman is an independent operator, owning his boat and gear and working on his own schedule. 
But he is also, this book emphasizes, part of a larger group -- a harbor gang. 
As is fitting for an anthropological study, these groups are the focus of <PERSON>Mr. Acheson</PERSON>'s attention. 

   Harbor gangs are not formal organizations. 
Lobstermen pay no dues, have no membership cards, and never hold annual meetings. 
Still, the groups are real. 
The men in a gang see each other almost every day. 
They share information, comradeship, problems and skills. 
More significantly, the harbor gangs restrict entry into the group and they "claim and defend fishing areas." 
They are, in short, territorial. 

   In many ways, harbor gangs reflect the structure of <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION>'s coastal communities. 
In these towns you are either an outsider (tourist, summer person or newcomer) or a local. 
The distinction is sharp and clearly understood, and winning admission to the community is difficult for anyone "from away." 

   Joining a harbor gang is similarly difficult. 
Like the members of a community, the members of a harbor gang know each other by sight and reputation, share a set of values, and view outsiders with distrust. 
And while there is a clear hierarchy within gangs, distinguishing the most successful fishermen, or "highliners," from the "moderates" and "dubs," every member of a gang has the right to fish in the group's territory. 

   These territories are more than unofficial -- they are illegal. 
No one owns the ocean floor, and the state says a license to fish is exactly that. 
Nevertheless, every fisherman knows that if he sets his pots outside of certain limits his buoys will get cut. 
At <MONEY>$40</MONEY> a trap, insisting on your right to fish for a <MONEY>$4</MONEY> lobster in someone else's backyard becomes unprofitable quickly. 

   Why do lobstermen, who generally obey the other laws regulating their business, continue to preempt territories? 
The answer is clear: Only so many lobsters mature every year, and more people fishing means a smaller share for each. 
<PERSON>Mr. Acheson</PERSON>'s data support this argument. 
Around islands, where territories are more strongly defended and entry into a harbor gang is more difficult, fishermen catch more lobsters per trap. 
Territorial rights, it seems, "help to conserve resources, promote economic efficiency, and result in higher incomes." 

   "The Lobster Gangs of <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION>" is wonderfully entertaining, and the information it contained agreed with everything I have learned during a decade of summers on the <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION> coast. 
But like any reviewer, I wanted to check. 
So I showed the book to a local fisherman. 
"Ayuh," he confirmed. 
"That's pretty much the way it is."

A TRUE-BLUE TEST FOR LOBSTER EATERS

<TEXT>
<P>
Every year, a few lobstermen find a freak when they haul in their traps -- a 
lobster with a shell as blue as the <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION> sky. 
</P>
<P>
And they'll often call <PERSON>Sam Chapman</PERSON>, the godfather of blue lobsters in <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION>. He 
has about 400, ranging in hue from powder blue to electric cobalt blue to "a 
blue so dark it's almost black." 
</P>
<P>
Most lobsters plucked from the <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION>'s icy waters are a mottled mixture of 
green, red and brown. They turn bright red when they're cooked. 
</P>
<P>
Blue lobsters are genetic mutations in which the crustacean's blue gene is 
dominant. About one in every 3 million or 4 million lobsters caught along the 
<LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION> coast is blue, <PERSON>Chapman</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
"Lobsters have genes for the production of red, yellow and blue," said <PERSON>Chapman</PERSON>, 
an aquaculture specialist at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Maine</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Darling Marine Center</ORGANIZATION>. 
"If the gene for red and the gene for yellow aren't functioning, you get a blue 
lobster." 
</P>
<P>
The disorder also produces lobsters with yellow shells, red shells and even 
yellow with black spots, known as calico lobsters. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman has been raising blue lobsters since <DATE>1982</DATE> in a study to determine if 
<LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION>'s fishing grounds can be restocked with lobsters raised in hatcheries. 
</P>
<P>
Hatcheries have operated in <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION> off and on for decades. But <PERSON>Chapman</PERSON> said no 
one has ever proved that restocking coastal waters increases the number of 
lobsters in the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the problem is that hatchery-raised lobsters are released when they are 
the size of a thumbnail and hard to tag for later identification. 
</P>
<P>
So with the blue lobster, <PERSON>Chapman</PERSON> said, "what you have is essentially a colored 
tag." 
</P>
<P>
"You can do all of the plot sampling and research that you want, but the proof 
of the pudding in this whole program is how many blue lobsters show up in 
traps" over the next five years, he said. 
</P>
<P>
It took from <DATE>1982</DATE> -- when he collected <PERSON>Amanda</PERSON> and <PERSON>Vinnie</PERSON>, the first two blues 
he bred -- until the <DATE>summer of 1988</DATE> to raise enough blue lobsters to get 
started. 
</P>
<P>
In <DATE>June</DATE> and <DATE>July 1988</DATE>, <PERSON>Chapman</PERSON> and another <ORGANIZATION>University of Maine</ORGANIZATION> researcher 
released 5,600 blue lobsters off <LOCATION>Boothbay Harbor</LOCATION>. In <DATE>1989</DATE>, they sampled the 
area and found two blues. But sampling this past <DATE>summer</DATE> turned up none. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman released 1,100 blue lobsters in <LOCATION>Pemaquid Harbor</LOCATION> this past <DATE>summer</DATE> and 
1,500 in <LOCATION>Cutler Harbor</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
He thinks the latest restocking will be easier to monitor because Pemaquid and 
<PERSON>Cutler</PERSON> are sheltered harbors. "My feeling is somewhere between three and four 
years after you let them go, they'll start showing up in traps," <PERSON>Chapman</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
He also has kept about 375 blue lobsters for behavior testing. They are living 
in rows of cages in his laboratory, each 2 years old, 3 to 4 inches long and 
bright blue. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, <PERSON>Chapman</PERSON> has older, larger blues that have been donated over the 
years by lobstermen. He fetched two for a photographer -- a 1 3/8 pounder that 
is 8 years old and a 2 1/2 pounder that is about 10 years old. 
</P>
<P>
"An obvious question is do blue lobsters survive at the same rate as regular 
lobsters do? What we need to know is, do they behave the same when they're 
introduced to the ocean bottom?" he said. 
</P>
<P>
To answer those questions, he has begun studies to see how blue lobsters behave 
when introduced to different environments with and without the presence of 
predators. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>David Dow</PERSON>, a former lobsterman and executive director of the <ORGANIZATION>Maine Lobster 
Institute</ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Maine</ORGANIZATION>, thinks <PERSON>Chapman</PERSON>'s work could be important 
for the future of the industry. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know how long our production is going to last," he said. "Ten years 
down the road, we might not have as large a supply. Or 10 years down the road, 
if we do our homework and expand our markets, we might want to increase our 
supply." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Anthony D'Agostino</PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION>Montauk Marine Science Institute</ORGANIZATION> on <LOCATION>Long 
Island</LOCATION>, said <PERSON>Chapman</PERSON>'s project seemed "worthwhile." 
</P>
<P>
"I just wonder if he has enough funding to do it properly," said <PERSON>D'Agostino</PERSON>, 
who has been studying lobsters since <DATE>1975</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman's funding is slight -- he started with <MONEY>$7,000</MONEY> from the <ORGANIZATION>Lobster Advisory 
Council</ORGANIZATION> and has kept going with a yearly stipend of about <MONEY>$600</MONEY> from the <LOCATION>Maine 
Lobstermen</LOCATION>'s Assn. 
</P>
<P>
For all <PERSON>Chapman</PERSON>'s work, however, he can't answer the key question on every 
lobster-lover's mind -- do blues taste the same? 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone asks that question," <PERSON>Chapman</PERSON> said. "The problem is we've never had 
enough to be able to eat any. So I don't know. I've never eaten a blue 
lobster."

<HEAD>Canadian Cabinet Rejects Proposed Settlement of Lobster Dispute</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM C. HIDLAY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A Canadian board on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> rejected a proposal to settle a
free trade dispute between lobstermen in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>.
   Canadian fishermen are allowed to keep and sell smaller lobsters
than their <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> counterparts. Representatives of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and
Canadian lobster industries recently had proposed increasing the
minimum size of lobsters taken along <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Atlantic Coast</LOCATION> to the
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> level of 3\ inches.
   The proposal also called for creating a joint U.S.-Canadian
committee to discuss lobster management issues and for both
countries to work together to promote and market lobsters.
   But on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, Canadian Trade Minister <PERSON>John Crosbie</PERSON> announced
in <LOCATION>Ottawa</LOCATION> that the country's federal cabinet had rejected the
proposed settlement.
   <PERSON>John Kearney</PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION>Maritime Fishermen's Union</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Yarmouth</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Nova Scotia</LOCATION>, hailed the decision.
   ``We have no biological reason in <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> for increasing our
minimum size,'' he said. ``We have a whole range of management and
regulatory measures ... that are non-existent in the <LOCATION>United
States</LOCATION>.''
   But lobster industry officials from <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION> predicted a worsening
of relations between the two countries because of the decision.
   ``For them to pull out of it means there's going to be more
bickering and fighting among all the various factions of the
industry,'' said <PERSON>William Anderson</PERSON>, a lobsterman from <LOCATION>Lubec</LOCATION> and
chairman of the state's <ORGANIZATION>Lobster Advisory Council</ORGANIZATION>.
   To <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> fishermen, the dispute over size is much more than
academic because they compete against Canadian lobstermen who sell
the majority of their catch in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>.
   ``It's a big deal because so many lobsters fit into that size
range. Lobsters that are just over that (minimum) measure make up
the majority of the catch,'' said <PERSON>David Dow</PERSON>, executive director of
the <ORGANIZATION>Maine Lobster Institute</ORGANIZATION>, a scientific and educational
organization that fosters cooperation in the lobster industry.
   At the urging of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> lobstermen, President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> signed
legislation last <DATE>December</DATE> banning the import of live Canadian
lobsters that are smaller than the minimum <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> size.
   <LOCATION>Ottawa</LOCATION> contended the new law violated the U.S.-Canada Free Trade
Agreement and would cost the industry <MONEY>$30 million</MONEY> of its <MONEY>$180
million</MONEY> live lobster industry. But an international panel ruled in
late <DATE>May</DATE> that the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> law did not violate the pact.
   The proposal rejected <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> called for increasing the
minimum size of lobsters taken along <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Atlantic Coast</LOCATION> to the
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> level of 3\ inches from the crustacean's eye socket to the
edge of its body where the tail begins.
   Currently, <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> has a range of minimum sizes from 2{ inches to
3 3-16 inches, depending on where the lobsters are caught.
   Some Canadian lobster industry officials were upset by their
country's decision. The nation's largest lobster exporter,
<ORGANIZATION>Clearwater Fine Foods</ORGANIZATION> of suburban <LOCATION>Bedford</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Nova Scotia</LOCATION>, has long
supported raising size limits for what it says are conservation
reasons.
   ``There is no competent biologist who advises other than the
desirability of raising size imits,'' company spokesman <PERSON>Doug
Robinson</PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION>Canadian Press</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
   ``The bottom line is most lobsters now caught are immature. They
have not spawned,'' he said.

ON THE TRAIL OF LOBSTER TAIL;

<P>
IT'S TIME TO TRAP COASTAL DELICACIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM CARLTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The seas were calm and the <TIME>morning</TIME> sky was a postcard blue as <PERSON>Rick Gallagher</PERSON> 
and his crew set out from <ORGANIZATION>Dana Point Harbor</ORGANIZATION> earlier this week to get a head 
start on the long-anticipated lobster season. 
</P>
<P>
Though the six-month season was not to open until today, <PERSON>Gallagher</PERSON>, 37, wanted 
to get all his traps and bait in place so he could waste no time in catching 
the spiny delicacy. 
</P>
<P>
"This part really isn't very exciting," <PERSON>Gallagher</PERSON> said as he secured a load of 
lobster traps on a 40-foot boat docked at <ORGANIZATION>Dana Wharf Sportfishing</ORGANIZATION>. "But 
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE>'s payday!" 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Gallagher</PERSON> and his crew of two were among dozens of local fishermen who this 
week began dotting the <LOCATION>Orange County</LOCATION> coastline with color-coded buoys that mark 
the spot where they have set lobster traps. 
</P>
<P>
Although commercial fishermen such as <PERSON>Gallagher</PERSON> won't check their traps until 
daybreak today, lobster season actually began hours earlier, at the stroke of 
<TIME>midnight</TIME>, when hundreds of scuba divers typically converge on <LOCATION>Laguna Beach</LOCATION> and 
other coastal waters to hunt for the night-crawling creatures. 
</P>
<P>
The season, which begins the <DATE>first Wednesday</DATE> of every <DATE>October</DATE>, lasts until the 
<DATE>first Wednesday</DATE> after the 15th of <DATE>March</DATE>, which in <DATE>1990</DATE> will fall on <DATE>March 21</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
But with ever-increasing hordes of fishermen in competition, <PERSON>Gallagher</PERSON> and 
others say it should take only a short time for everyone to deplete the seas of 
catchable crustaceans. 
</P>
<P>
"We catch <PERCENT>75%</PERCENT> the first four days," <PERSON>Gallagher</PERSON> said. "By Thanksgiving, it (the 
season) is pretty much over." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the growing popularity of the pastime, the species of spiny lobster 
that inhabits the <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION> coastline does not appear to be in any 
danger. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, figures from the <ORGANIZATION>California Department of Fish</ORGANIZATION> and Game indicate that 
the crustacean is thriving, with a record haul of 634,468 pounds in the state 
reported last season. The lobster catch has been increasing steadily since 
<DATE>1975</DATE>, when a record low of 152,000 pounds was tallied statewide. 
</P>
<P>
Although the figures are for the entire coast, they come primarily from 
<LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION>, Fish and Game officials say, as the crustaceans do not 
generally venture into the colder waters north of <LOCATION>Santa Barbara</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Fish and Game officials attribute the growth in the lobster population to state 
legislation in <DATE>1975</DATE> requiring escape ports in trap cages for below-limit 
adolescent lobsters. Before those ports were mandated, young and old lobsters 
alike were scooped up into the traps, causing a steady decline in the species, 
said <PERSON>Dave Parker</PERSON>, a Fish and Game marine biologist in <LOCATION>Long Beach</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The vast bulk of the lobster catch is made by commercial fishermen, who have no 
limits other than not taking in any lobster less than a regulation 3 1/4 inches 
long, <PERSON>Parker</PERSON> said. Sport fishermen, by contrast, are restricted to seven 
lobsters per day. 
</P>
<P>
But commercial fishermen complain that some divers raid their traps and make 
off with much more than their daily allotment. One fishermen said a surfer once 
used his board to lift a heavy trap and remove the contents. 
</P>
<P>
Some divers take this illegal shortcut because it is extremely difficult to 
capture the elusive lobster by hand, <PERSON>Parker</PERSON> said. A wary creature by nature, 
lobsters tend to congregate in rock and coral formations where they can quickly 
scurry out of reach, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"They tend to move faster than you do," <PERSON>Parker</PERSON> said. "And they maintain as many 
as three escape routes." 
</P>
<P>
The commercial fishermen don't have to be concerned with the speed or 
elusiveness of their prey. They merely bait a cage with mackerel and wait for a 
lobster to follow its nose inside, where a trap door swings shut. 
</P>
<P>
Although it sounds easy enough, it involves a lot of work and preparation. For 
example, the first order of business for <PERSON>Rick Gallagher</PERSON> was building his 
3-foot-square and 3-by-4-foot metal cages by hand. 
</P>
<P>
"See these," he said, extending heavily 
</P>
<P>
blistered and callused palms. "That's from making these things." 
</P>
<P>
Weighing up to 60 pounds apiece, the cages are then fitted with up to 30 feet 
of yellow-colored line, at the end of which a buoy marker is attached. Each 
fishermen uses his own color to distinguish his catch from the rest. Gallagher 
chose pink for his. 
</P>
<P>
Last <DATE>weekend</DATE>, <PERSON>Gallagher</PERSON> set out his first 20 traps along the coast just north 
of <ORGANIZATION>Dana Point Harbor</ORGANIZATION>. On <DATE>Monday</DATE>, he worked with boat skipper <PERSON>Todd Mansur</PERSON>, 23, 
of <PERSON>Dana Point</PERSON>, and deckhand <PERSON>Jeff Belet</PERSON>, 18, of <PERSON>Dana Point</PERSON>, to throw out another 
84. 
</P>
<P>
The trap-setting was long, arduous work, interspersed with rest breaks of 
potato chips and cold beer. Working about a mile off the coast between <LOCATION>Dana 
Point Harbor</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>San Clemente</LOCATION> Pier -- six miles away -- <PERSON>Mansur</PERSON> maneuvered 
the 40-foot Cyperlurus into position as <PERSON>Gallagher</PERSON> directed and Belet hefted the 
cages gently overboard. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been doing this for about six years," <PERSON>Belet</PERSON> said, straining under the 
load of a cage he was about to drop into the turquoise-green water. "It's fun, 
if we don't lose our traps. A bad storm can cause sand to fill up the trap so 
that you can't move it. Or, it can go under rocks and get smashed up and 
useless." 
</P>
<P>
Intermittent large swells on <DATE>Monday</DATE> gave a hint of storm activity elsewhere in 
the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION>. Gallagher looked at the swells with some concern, but then 
shrugged his shoulders, saying that the vulnerability of the traps makes the 
whole lobster business something of a gamble. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is everything can look great, like today, and then a storm comes 
along," <PERSON>Gallagher</PERSON> said. "Then you're dead." 
</P>
<P>
It costs about <MONEY>$50</MONEY> to outfit each cage, <PERSON>Gallagher</PERSON> said. Because up to 20 
one-pound lobsters can be caught in each trap -- and with lobster now fetching 
up to <MONEY>$6</MONEY> a pound -- <PERSON>Gallagher</PERSON> figures his operation stands to net <MONEY>$120</MONEY> per 
cage, or more than <MONEY>$10,000</MONEY> for all the cages he has put out. 
</P>
<P>
That's not exactly peanuts, but at the same time <PERSON>Gallagher</PERSON> doesn't view it as 
having the same kind of profit-making potential as taking boatloads of paying 
fishermen out. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think you can look at this (lobster fishing) as a livelihood," he 
said. "It's something else to do on the water. It means just getting out of the 
house." 
</P>
<P>
For <DATE>Monday</DATE>'s trap-setting operation, <PERSON>Gallagher</PERSON> chose the shallower waters just 
off the coast, where spiny lobsters spend each <DATE>summer</DATE> spawning eggs before 
retreating to deeper waters for the winter. 
</P>
<P>
He was particularly interested in dropping traps around kelp beds, which grow 
from the kind of rock formations that lobsters love to inhabit. Mansur, the 
skipper, also monitored a video screen on a Fathometer that reveals ocean depth 
as well as whether there are rocky or sandy conditions on the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all hard bottom here," <PERSON>Mansur</PERSON> said as he squinted his eyes to look into 
the Fathometer while cruising slowly through one large kelp bed off <LOCATION>San 
Clemente</LOCATION>. "It's perfect." 
</P>
<P>
"<PERSON>Todd</PERSON>," <PERSON>Gallagher</PERSON> called out from the deck about that time, "let's put one in 
here. We found a lot in here one year." 
</P>
<P>
The crew wound up setting out a half-dozen traps in that same location. They 
had been preceded by several other fishermen, whose earlier presence was 
evidenced by black, yellow and red buoys bobbing in the vicinity. 
</P>
<P>
When the crew had finished about <DATE>two hours later</DATE>, they headed back to shore, 
prepared to return <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> morning to pull the traps up from the water and load 
them with bait. Under state law, commercial fishermen are allowed to bait their 
traps the day before lobster season begins. 
</P>
<P>
"<PERSON>Rick</PERSON>, you gonna remember any of this?" Belet asked <PERSON>Gallagher</PERSON> in reference to 
the location of all the traps. 
</P>
<P>
"It's gonna be so easy," <PERSON>Mansur</PERSON> chimed in with a grin, pointing at a long line 
of pink buoys receding into the distance toward <ORGANIZATION>Dana Point Harbor</ORGANIZATION>. "It's gonna 
be a straight line." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SPINY LOBSTERS 
</P>
<P>
Name: Spiny lobsters make up the genus Panulirus and are also called sea 
crayfish. Panulirus interruptus is the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> spiny lobster of the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> 
coast. 
</P>
<P>
Where found: Spiny or rock lobsters are found along the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> coast of <LOCATION>North 
America</LOCATION>, the African coasts, the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> and the coasts of <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New 
Zealand</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Uses: In various other European countries and in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, the frozen 
tails of spiny lobsters are marketed as rock lobsters. 
</P>
<P>
Description: Unlike true lobsters, members of the Palinuridae family (so called 
because of their very spiny bodies), do not have large claws. Usually only the 
abdomen is eaten and is marketed as lobster tail. The antennae are strongly 
developed. Most species live in tropical waters. 
</P>
<P>
Habitat: They spend their days in crevices in rock or coral, emerging by night 
to forage for invertebrate prey. They return from their nightly wanderings to 
dens within a feeding range of hundreds of meters, and after several weeks they 
may move several kilometers to a new location.

   Hot lights rather than boiling water may
have killed a 1\-pound lobster that gained attention when the woman
who bought it for a <ORGANIZATION>Valentine</ORGANIZATION>'s Day feast decided to spare it from
the pot.
   <PERSON>Suzanne Brown</PERSON> said the <MONEY>$14</MONEY> <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION> lobster she dubbed Oscar died
this <DATE>weekend</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Gary Gerontis</PERSON>, a seafood merchant who had offered to fly the
lobster back to <LOCATION>New England</LOCATION> so that it could be tossed back into the
ocean, told <PERSON>Mrs. Brown</PERSON> on <DATE>Friday</DATE> that Oscar was terminally ill.
   She said she gave him permission to put the lobster to sleep by
placing it in the freezer.
   <PERSON>Mrs. Brown</PERSON>, tearful over the whole incident, said she feared the
media attention she stirred up to save Oscar might have caused its
demise.
   She said she told her story to the news media in hopes of finding
a tank for Oscar. The story of the woman who fell for the lobster
became an instant hit, and Oscar spent ensuing days under hot
television lights, a pen shoved in one claw to sign autographs.
   ``Everybody thought it was a wonderful story and it did make a
lot of people happy,'' she said.
   <PERSON>Mrs. Brown</PERSON> said she planned to bury the crustacean at <ORGANIZATION>Point
Penrose State Park</ORGANIZATION>.
   Her husband, <PERSON>Dave</PERSON>, planned to help bury the lobster that was
intended for his dinner plate. While he supported her efforts, he
offered a final observation: ``I never did get my dinner.''

<HL> A Miracle in Maine: Sea Urchin Is Turned Into the Golden Uni --- Despised Creature Provides Town With New Export, A Delicacy for Japanese </HL>

<TEXT>
   Lobstermen hated them. 
Most people ignored them -- unless they happened to step on one. 

   For years, the prickly sea urchins that carpet much of the ocean floor off this hamlet were considered pests. 
The greenish, disk-shaped creatures mowed down shallow-water seaweed pastures favored by lobsters, chasing the delectable crustaceans far offshore. 

   Then, the Japanese arrived and changed, perhaps forever, the way Down Easterners view urchins. 
Along <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION>'s northeastern coast, where worm-digging, blueberry-raking and clamming rank as major occupations, folks are discovering there's gold in those spiked shells. 
Or something pretty close. 
Harrington now processes and exports urchins to <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>, from a factory run by <PERSON>Shiro</PERSON> "Sean" <PERSON>Nakagawa</PERSON> and staffed largely by locals. 

   It's as if <ORGANIZATION>New Yorkers</ORGANIZATION> discovered that cockroaches spin silk. 

   "Uni," as the Japanese call the orange-yellow reproductive organs that are the urchin's only edible part, "is more expensive than silver," <PERSON>Mr. Nakagawa</PERSON> notes. 

   He isn't joking. 
At <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Tsukiji</LOCATION> fishmarket auctions, carefully arranged wooden trays of glistening uni fetch up to <MONEY>8,000 yen</MONEY>, or <MONEY>$63</MONEY>, apiece -- at wholesale. 
That's more than <MONEY>$100</MONEY> a pound. 

   Harrington has learned to love the lowly urchin's earning power. 
Palate appeal is another story. 
When a visitor to the uni plant accepts <PERSON>Pearl Smith</PERSON>'s offer to sample the orange goo she has just spooned from a cracked-open shell, he quickly finds the sweet-and-pungent sea urchin isn't the hors d'oeuvre of choice hereabout. 

   <PERSON>Mrs. Smith</PERSON> snickers. 
Heads turn. 
Eyes roll. 
"He's eating the stuff," cries one woman over the country music blaring in the background. 
"Oh, my God!" swoons another. 
Sue <PERSON>Fickett</PERSON>, a 46-year-old worker from nearby <LOCATION>Cherryfield</LOCATION>, glares at the visitor and screams, "You're gross!" 

   <PERSON>Jessie McHatton</PERSON>, aged 72, is more genteel. 
"You and <PERSON>Nelson Rockefeller</PERSON>," she chides. 

   Nelson Rockefeller? 

   <PERSON>Mrs. McHatton</PERSON>, it seems, knew the gardener at the <ORGANIZATION>Rockefeller</ORGANIZATION> estate near <LOCATION>Bar Harbor</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION>. 
And the gardener claims that <PERSON>Mr. Rockefeller</PERSON> -- or at least some of his guests -- savored urchin. 

   The cosmopolitan Rockefellers may have developed an appetite for urchin not in the Orient but on the Continent. 
To the French, the sea urchin is the "chataigne de mer," the "chestnut of the sea." 
Along the Cote d'Azur, urchins are consumed raw, like oysters, with a lemon or vinegar-and-shallot dressing. 
Martinique features urchin soup. 
In <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, chefs lay slivers of raw uni atop seaweed-wrapped sushi. 

   Perry's Seafood, just down Route 1 from the uni factory, serves scallops, shrimp, clams and haddock, but no urchins. 
<PERSON>Barbara Perry</PERSON> says she has, however, thought of trying to deep-fry some -- a proposition that may strike devotees as akin to hard-boiling caviar. 

   Plainly, people here are more interested in the dough. 
"Any kind of business they can bring to <LOCATION>Washington County</LOCATION> is fabulous," <PERSON>Mrs. Perry</PERSON> says. 
One in five residents of the county, <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION>'s poorest, lives below the federal poverty line. 
Winter work is scarce, and the population has shrunk since the late 1800s. 

   Thus, people welcome the hourly wages, ranging from <MONEY>$4</MONEY> for scooping the oozing organs from their shells to <MONEY>$5.75</MONEY> for the more demanding task of sorting and arraying them delicately on trays. 
In <PERSON>Harrington</PERSON>, a town of 850, <PERSON>Mr. Nakagawa</PERSON> now employs about 40 people. 
Later this year, he plans to raise that to 120, the number he will need to increase production to 100 tons annually. 

   He will also need at least 10 million urchins to meet that goal. 
That will create more business for local fishermen. 
Some already haul in well over <MONEY>$1,000</MONEY> worth a week -- better than they can do dragging for scallops or mussels these days. 
Indeed, Japanese purchases of everything from tuna to monkfish livers have been helping business, despite the occasional cross-cultural misstep: Some sly fishermen, for example, have been known to slip other livers in with those from monkfish, a practice that "really makes the Japanese mad," says <PERSON>Dallas Pyle</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Portland</LOCATION> trader. 

   Japanese urchin merchants have been working the <LOCATION>West Coast</LOCATION> for a decade or more, using North American uni to supply <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> during the fall and winter, when the delicacy is popular but local supplies are limited. 
Until lately, air-transport costs made it impractical to exploit <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION>'s treasure trove. 
But the rising yen and dwindling <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> supplies led some traders to look again. 
<ORGANIZATION>Mitake Trading International Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> supplier to <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Daiei</ORGANIZATION> superstore chain, dispatched <PERSON>Mr. Nakagawa</PERSON> on a mission. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Nakagawa</PERSON> drove cross-country last <DATE>May</DATE> and spent four months scouring the <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION> coast. 
The fishing seemed best toward <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>, but transportation was a problem. 
He settled on an abandoned garage here -- as far up the coast as he could get and still be within a day's drive of <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Logan International Airport</LOCATION>. 

   He isn't alone. 
There are similar but smaller operations in two nearby villages. 
Others are shipping whole <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION> urchins to <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>. 
And some Japanese traders, convinced that <ORGANIZATION>Mainers</ORGANIZATION> will never master the subtle art of uni processing, are sending whole urchins to <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, too. 

   The <PERSON>Harrington</PERSON> plant does have its quality-control problems. 

   During snack break, <PERSON>Mr. Nakagawa</PERSON> delivers a pep talk urging extra care in scooping out the gonads, which have recently softened in anticipation of <DATE>spring</DATE> mating season. 
When a deliveryman arrives from <ORGANIZATION>Downeast Plastics of Cap Pele</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>New Brunswick</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Nakagawa</PERSON> displays flaws in the last shipment of polystyrene packing trays: The edges on some had crumbled, causing at least one irate Japanese consumer to rail about polystyrene bits in his uni; others collapsed, spilling their precious cargo; the custom-made trays lack grooves to keep the urchins in place. 
It takes some diagrams, but <PERSON>Mr. Nakagawa</PERSON> gets his message across. 

   To the <LOCATION>East Coast</LOCATION> elite, the <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION> coast may conjure up summer idylls. 
To <PERSON>Mr. Nakagawa</PERSON> and his two Japanese assistants here, it's more like the gulag archipelago: lots of sub-zero weather and 18-hour workdays. 
<PERSON>Mr. Nakagawa</PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON>Kiyomi</PERSON>, liked <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> better. 

   Still, <PERSON>Mr. Nakagawa</PERSON> counts his blessings. 
Because he has a stable buyer, he expects to operate year-round, with a core labor force of about 30 in the <DATE>summer</DATE>. 

   For <LOCATION>Washington County</LOCATION>, there could be other benefits. 
"Everybody thinks it's going to help the lobsters," says <PERSON>Ron Hudson</PERSON>, a 47-year-old mussel fisherman turned urchin trawler. 
Everybody may be right. 
<PERSON>Larry Harris</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>University of New Hampshire</ORGANIZATION> zoologist, says the urchins tend to overgraze, denying lobsters food and hiding places. 

   One cloud on the horizon: The urchin in <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION>, as in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, could be overharvested. 
Trawling Frenchman Bay, <PERSON>Mr. Hudson</PERSON> fingers his long, brown-and-gray beard and ponders that danger. 
Already, his steel net is hauling in far fewer urchins of the acceptable size of 2 1/2 to 4 inches than when he began working the inlet last <DATE>September</DATE>. 
Neither he nor his brother, <PERSON>Robert</PERSON>, a former worm-digger, knows how long the smaller fry take to mature. 

   But salvation may be on the way. 
Several swipes of the net yield a half-dozen slimy, mud-colored animals known as sea cucumbers for every urchin. 
<PERSON>Mr. Hudson</PERSON> hears that the Chinese eat the things, and someone's looking into it.

<HEAD>High-Tech Laser Guns Mark Lobsters, Catch Poachers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Electronic equipment similar to ``laser tag''
games is helping game wardens detect sophisticated lobster poachers.
   The Passive Integrated Tag Gun actually is a pistol-shaped
sensing unit connected to a computer; it sets off an alarm when it
detects a tiny metal tag placed in the body of a lobster, said game
warden <PERSON>Mike Castleton</PERSON>.
   When a lobster is showered with the invisible but harmless beam,
the tag number is recorded and displayed on a monitor. The tags,
nearly impossible to detect with the naked eye, give crustaceans
sort of an electronic fingerprint.
   The device has been used to track migrating fish for several
years, but was used to catch a poacher of <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> spiny lobsters
for the first time in early <DATE>October</DATE> off the <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> coast,
<PERSON>Castleton</PERSON> said.
   It remains to be seen, however, whether the gun will reduce such
illegal catches or just cause poachers to figure out ways to avoid
detection. ``They are forcing us to become more sophisticated,''
<PERSON>Castleton</PERSON> said.
   ``You catch on to all their tricks after a while when you've
seen the same thing a couple of hundred times. People try to hide
lobsters in their clothes, secret compartments in their boats, all
over.''
   Though its now being used only against sport fishermen,
<PERSON>Castleton</PERSON> said he expects the electronic gun eventually to be used
to reduce commercial poaching. Commercial fishermen often complain
that competitors raid their traps.
   More dishonest fishermen than ever seem to be plucking lobsters
and other fish from <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION> waters, he said. Entire
generations of lobsters can be wiped out by just a few aggressive
poachers.
   <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> spiny lobsters, which thrive off the <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> coast,
live in crevices and feed at night on fish, algae, eel grass and
invertebrates. Their name is derived from the sharp spines on their
shells. They don't have large pinching claws like their cousins in
the <LOCATION>Atlantic Ocean</LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Pet Lobster Seized; Kids Cry</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BROOKSVILLE, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man who is in hot water after being
caught with an oversize lobster says ``Herb'' was a pet and <ORGANIZATION>Marine
Patrol</ORGANIZATION> officers went too far when they seized the 10-pound
crustacean and made two boys cry.
   <PERSON>James Benenson</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>New Yorker</LOCATION> and <DATE>summer</DATE> resident of this Down
East town, said <DATE>Friday</DATE> he would not mind paying the <MONEY>$71.50</MONEY> fine for
lobster fishing without a license. But he pleaded innocent at
arraignment <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   ``The reason I'm scrapping about it is that I think it is quite
silly bothering children over a benign act,'' <PERSON>Benenson</PERSON> said.
   He said two officers confiscated <DATE>Herb earlier this month</DATE> from
the submersible box where his sons <PERSON>James</PERSON>, 10, and <PERSON>Clement</PERSON>, 8, had
kept it for about seven years.
   ``They cried their eyes out,'' said <PERSON>Benenson</PERSON>. He recalled his
younger son telling him, ``Daddy, police are supposed to help you,
not make you cry.''
   <PERSON>Benenson</PERSON> said he does not know where <PERSON>Herb</PERSON> was taken, ``but we
hope he's not in someone's stomach.''
   Messages left <DATE>Friday</DATE> at the <ORGANIZATION>Marine Patrol</ORGANIZATION> headquarters in
<LOCATION>Augusta</LOCATION> were not returned immediately. A secretary said no officers
were available at the <LOCATION>Ellsworth</LOCATION> field office, and referred calls to
<LOCATION>Augusta</LOCATION>.
   Herb lived on seafood fed by his ``family.''
   ``He loved pogies,'' a fish used for bait and oil, said
<PERSON>Benenson</PERSON>. ``He loved dogfish. He could eat a 3-foot dogfish in less
than a week, and he would eat everything but the teeth.''
   Herb also loved to be scratched while lying on the dock,
preferably with mussel shells _ and that is what ultimately led to
<PERSON>Benenson</PERSON>'s citation.
   Officers spotted the lobster earlier this month. Later, two
officers came to <PERSON>Benenson</PERSON>'s home and demanded identification so
they could cite him, <PERSON>Benenson</PERSON> said.
   <PERSON>Benenson</PERSON> said he tried to find a new home for Herb at aquariums
but failed, and the officers later confiscated the lobster.
   Technically, <PERSON>Benenson</PERSON> is accused of lobster fishing with the
wooden box his sons used to catch crabs, said <PERSON>Benenson</PERSON>.
   His lawyer, <PERSON>Barry Mills</PERSON>, said he hopes to work out an agreement
with prosecutors ``in as amicable a way as possible.''
   ``On a scale of crime from one to 1,000, this is a one half,''
said <PERSON>Mills</PERSON>.

JACK SMITH: SHOWING SOME BACKBONE BY AVOIDING MEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Smith 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gradually, in response to appeals from save-the-animals groups and in obeisance 
to my own conscience, I am eliminating meat from my diet. That is, I have given 
up scallops, oysters, snails and all the other invertebrates, which I never 
liked anyway. 
</P>
<P>
I don't mean to be cynical. I am horrified by stories of how young cows are 
raised for veal, and I don't even like to think of what life must be like for 
chickens. In fact, I have given up veal. The problem is, I still eat chicken. 
</P>
<P>
My excuse, of course, is that it is not ordained that we refrain from eating 
meat. Random Chance made us omnivorous. We are at the top of the food chain, 
and we may eat whatever appeals to us, without sin. In the <LOCATION>Bible</LOCATION>, did they not 
barbecue the fatted calf? Was Jesus not a fisherman? 
</P>
<P>
It is also true that the people who champion animals are more inclined to favor 
vertebrates than non-vertebrates. It is much easier to love a panda than a 
jellyfish. 
</P>
<P>
However, as <PERSON>Sy Montgomery</PERSON> noted on The Times' science page some time ago, 
people are beginning to realize that invertebrates are worthy creatures too. In 
<LOCATION>Plainfield</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.H.</LOCATION>, he pointed out, the people have adopted the <ORGANIZATION>Cobblestone Tiger 
Beetle</ORGANIZATION> as their town insect, and sales of T-shirts displaying the beetle on 
them pay for the protection of its habitat. 
</P>
<P>
That being the way the wind is blowing, I am happy to receive a letter from 
<PERSON>Mario E. Baur</PERSON>, a professor of chemistry at <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION>, commending me for my recent 
column on the banana slug, a species that, as he points out, "does not usually 
receive favorable publicity." 
</P>
<P>
Introducing me to a new word, he observes that "unfortunately, most humans, 
even those who relate positively to animals, tend to be rather chordocentric 
(from <LOCATION>Phylum Chordata</LOCATION>, the vertebrates, broadly speaking) and may be willing to 
grant a certain right to exist to a lamb or squirrel while wishing to deny it 
to a termite, mosquito or slug." 
</P>
<P>
As <PERSON>Montgomery</PERSON> pointed out, people used to think that "invertebrates were there 
to swat, spray or step on." 
</P>
<P>
I myself have trouble identifying with flies, ants and back-yard snails. I 
realize that flies are marvelous flying machines, that ants exist in highly 
organized societies and that snails -- frankly, I can't think of anything good 
to say about snails. 
</P>
<P>
"Surely," however, Prof. <PERSON>Baur</PERSON> argues, "all creatures are equal in the eyes of 
Uncle Random. . . . Even spineless individuals have feelings." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Baur</PERSON> recalls that some years ago a certain garden snail in their yard came to 
recognize his wife, and would crawl toward her whenever she put out birdseed. 
This snail (they recognized it by its markings) would not come out to anyone 
else. 
</P>
<P>
"It continued to appear in this fashion for most of the <DATE>summer</DATE> and fall, and 
then, I presume, someone -- perhaps one of the skunks or opossums to whom we 
try to show hospitality -- got him or her. Severe but necessary is the way of 
the food chain." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Baur</PERSON> confesses that he can not bear the sight of live lobsters in holding tanks 
at supermarkets. (I have also seen them in some restaurants, waiting for some 
hungry patron to pick them out.) 
</P>
<P>
"I used to love to eat lobsters," <PERSON>Baur</PERSON> admits, "until one day, while keeping 
one alive until dinner time in my bathtub, I had occasion to watch it and 
realized that it was watching me, with emotions which I could (I hope not 
entirely fancifully) imagine." 
</P>
<P>
I am reminded of the remark made by <PERSON>Dahlia Gomez</PERSON> when her husband, <PERSON>Romulo</PERSON>, 
dropped a live lobster into a pot of boiling water. She turned to me and said, 
"They don't like it, you know." 
</P>
<P>
Oddly, <PERSON>Baur</PERSON> no longer eats lobsters or any other wild creatures, though he 
thinks it quite all right to kill and eat domestic animals. "I cheerfully eat 
steak, hamburgers, chicken and yes, Dodger Dogs." 
</P>
<P>
As I say, I'm gradually eliminating certain kinds of animal flesh from my diet, 
but, like Prof. <PERSON>Baur</PERSON>, I tend to rationalize. I may give up steak, but not 
hamburger; I may give up oysters, but not orange roughie; I may give up shrimp, 
but not bacon; I may give up veal but not little pig sausages. 
</P>
<P>
And I'll never give up Dodger Dogs.

   At about 3 foot long, the lobster is believed to be one of the

   Residents keep their windows shut and an
inn has closed as the stench from thousands of rotting fish fills
the air.
   In the waters of <LOCATION>Quahog Bay</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION>'s latest menhaden kill has
suffocated thousands of lobsters, crabs, snails and other sea life.
   ``The eels are even dead and they're hard to kill,'' said <PERSON>Linda
Webber</PERSON>, who owns <PERSON>Webber</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Sons Lobster Co.</ORGANIZATION> with her husband in
this seacoast town of 2,500 about 15 miles from <LOCATION>Portland</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Webber</PERSON>
said the company has lost about <MONEY>$10,000</MONEY> worth of lobsters.
   <PERSON>Robert Waddle</PERSON>, owner of <ORGANIZATION>Quahog Lobster Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, the other lobster
dealer at <LOCATION>Quahog Bay</LOCATION>, said he has lost at least that much. Lobsters
generally sell for less than <MONEY>$4</MONEY> a pound in <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION> this time of year;
wholesalers commonly keep the crustaceans in holding pens in bays
or harbors.
   ``The overall loss is tremendous. Not just my loss, but
everyone's loss because everything in the bay's been killed,''
<PERSON>Waddle</PERSON> said.
   Vast schools of menhaden, or pogies, first were chased into
<LOCATION>Quahog Bay</LOCATION> by feeding bluefish about a month ago, <PERSON>Waddle</PERSON> said
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE>. The schools severely depleted the oxygen in the water,
killing lobsters and other aquatic life.
   Dead pogies can be seen floating in clumps throughout the cove
and are caked onto rocks along the shore.
   ``It's been like this for almost a month, but the past few days
have been unbearable,'' said <PERSON>Marianne Lavine</PERSON>, who has kept a <DATE>summer</DATE>
home at <LOCATION>Quahog Bay</LOCATION> for 20 years. ``We've had the doors and windows
closed for three days now. It irritates your throat and nose. It's
disgusting.''
   The smell is so bad that a bed-and-breakfast on the bay closed.
One of the inn's owners said he and his wife will not reopen until
the odor is gone.
   Fish kills have happened along <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION>'s coast several times in
recent years, but ``this is certainly a large die-off,'' said
<PERSON>Marshall Murphy</PERSON>, spokesman for the state <ORGANIZATION>Department of Marine
Resources</ORGANIZATION>.
   Pogies are oily fish that can weigh up to two pounds and are
used for lobster bait, fertilizer and cat food.
   An estimated 3,000 pounds of pogies, or 50 bushels, washed
ashore in <LOCATION>Belfast Bay</LOCATION> in <DATE>September 1987</DATE>. In <DATE>August 1985</DATE>, about
8,000 bushels of pogies washed into a cove in <LOCATION>Southport</LOCATION>, and
officials brought in a huge vacuum cleaner to suck the rotting fish
out of the water. In <DATE>1984</DATE> about 25,000 menhaden and 500 bluefish
died in the <LOCATION>Kennebec River</LOCATION>, also from oxygen deprivation.
   <PERSON>Murphy</PERSON> said the state won't attempt a cleanup in <LOCATION>Quahog Bay</LOCATION>. He
said past cleanups have proved to be ``very expensive and less than
totally successful.''
   ``At this point, our decision is to allow nature to continue the
decomposition process of the menhaden,'' he said. It takes about 10
days for the fish to decompose.
   There is no river is at the head of the bay to flush the cove,
so only winds and tides may help.
   A northerly wind last week carried some of the pogies away, but
a southwesterly wind this week carried the dead fish back into the
bay, <PERSON>Murphy</PERSON> said.

<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lobstermen are feuding again in the rich
lobster-fishing areas of <LOCATION>Casco Bay</LOCATION>, and in one dispute two
fishermen were tossed in the harbor, a gun was brandished and a
boat damaged.
   ``It's a territorial dispute,'' <ORGANIZATION>Maine Marine Patrol</ORGANIZATION> Lt. <PERSON>Joseph
Fessenden</PERSON> said <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>. ``It's a situation where there's a limited
area of space to fish.
   ``The lobstermen are competing for the same area and we've had a
situation where they've been cutting each other's traps,'' he said.
``There have been several lobstermen who've lost <MONEY>several thousand
dollars</MONEY> worth of traps. This has been happening throughout the
<DATE>summer</DATE>.''
   Discontent has been high among <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION>'s estimated 4,000 full-time
lobstermen. Strikes throughout the <DATE>summer</DATE> protested prices being
paid for lobster catches.
   Softshell lobsters often have sold for as low as <MONEY>$1.75</MONEY> to <MONEY>$1.85</MONEY>
a pound wholesale this <DATE>summer</DATE>, said <PERSON>Bob Brown</PERSON>, president of the
<ORGANIZATION>Maine Import-Export Lobster Dealers Association</ORGANIZATION>. He said this price
resulted from supply and demand. Maine harvested about 22 million
pounds of lobster in <DATE>1988</DATE>, 24 million in <DATE>1989</DATE> and this year's
prediction is 26 million pounds.
   Under pressure to maintain their income, the dozen boat crews
feuding in <LOCATION>Portland Harbor</LOCATION> have been suspicious of others taking
more than their fair share, <PERSON>Fessenden</PERSON> said.
   ``They call this area `the <LOCATION>Bay of Pigs</LOCATION>' and this is one of the
reasons,'' he said.
   Lobstermen have their own specially marked buoys attached to a
line of lobster traps. Every day, they travel through their
territory, stopping at each of their buoys to haul up their lines,
empty the traps, put in new bait and dump them back in the water.
   On <DATE>Monday</DATE>, a dispute between the captains of two boats, the B&amp;B
and the Rambler, turned violent in what <PERSON>Fessenden</PERSON> described as the
worst confrontation he has seen in 15 years as a <ORGANIZATION>Marine Patrol</ORGANIZATION>
officer.
   <PERSON>Fessenden</PERSON> said the B&amp;B pulled alongside the Rambler as its
captain, <PERSON>Matthew Chipman</PERSON>, 28, of <LOCATION>Portland</LOCATION>, was trying to pull up a
string of traps that had been cut.
   <PERSON>Norman Solak</PERSON>, 52, a longtime lobsterman from <LOCATION>West Buxton</LOCATION>, and
one of his crew, <PERSON>Edward Mains Jr.</PERSON>, 36, of <LOCATION>Gorham</LOCATION>, boarded the
<ORGANIZATION>Rambler</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Fessenden</PERSON> said.
   The two crews struggled, he said, and <PERSON>Solak</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mains</PERSON> were
thrown into the harbor.
   <PERSON>Fessenden</PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION>Rambler</ORGANIZATION>'s crew charged later in a radio call
to the <ORGANIZATION>Coast Guard</ORGANIZATION> that one of the B&amp;B's crew brandished a gun.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Marine Patrol</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Coast Guard</ORGANIZATION> confiscated three weapons
from the B&amp;B: a .30-caliber rifle, a .22-caliber handgun and a
.38-caliber handgun.
   One of the boats also was damaged in the confrontation, said a
<ORGANIZATION>Marine Patrol</ORGANIZATION> officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   <PERSON>Fessenden</PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION>Marine Patrol</ORGANIZATION> is investigating whether to
file criminal charges against the crews involved.
   ``It's highly illegal to molest another man's gear,'' said <PERSON>David
Dow</PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION>Lobster Institute</ORGANIZATION>, a cooperative
research program at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Maine</ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION>Orono</LOCATION>. ``It's an
automatic, three-year license suspension for anybody caught doing
it.
   ``But territoriality has been around for as long as anybody can
remember,'' Dow said. ``It's rare that you see a territorial
dispute flare up in this overt fashion. Most of the territorial
disputes are only handled in the thick fog and the black of night.''

<HL> To Get a Lobsterman Steaming, Just Try Messing With His Traps </HL>
<AUTHOR> Diane Tracy (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR>
<SO> </SO>
<TEXT>
   Maine lobstermen are considered an independent and cantankerous breed, and most attempts at intervention in their industry are about as welcome as an empty lobster trap. 

   The latest try is no exception -- though it began as a bid to improve lobster traps. 
Instead, it's resulted in traps that let lobsters get away, lobstermen complain. 

   The dispute involves a state rule requiring that the traps include some biodegradable parts, so that lobsters can escape from "ghost traps" -- the estimated 92,000 traps lost on the ocean floor annually that keep catching and killing lobsters. 

   Some lobstermen have experimented with the new traps, usually equipped with a plastic panel attached by iron fasteners designed to rust out. 
But they say the fasteners fall apart too fast. 
They are supposed to last a full season, usually from <DATE>March</DATE> to <DATE>December</DATE>, but in some cases fall apart within three to six months. 

   "The concept is a good one," says <PERSON>Edward A. Blackmore</PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION>Maine Lobstermen's Association</ORGANIZATION>. 
"But the technology to develop the biodegradable fasteners didn't come along as well as everyone thought it would." 

   <PERSON>Frank Chalmers</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION> lobsterman, says he used some of the traps for six months, and "about half the doors came open in that time." 
But, he adds, different versions of the traps were tested, and now some think "they know what will work and what won't." 

   The law took effect <DATE>Jan. 1</DATE> but hasn't been enforced. 
And state Rep. <PERSON>Roland Salsbury</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Bar Harbor</LOCATION>, whose constituency includes about 500 of <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION>'s more than 8,000 licensed lobstermen, has proposed a bill delaying the law until <DATE>1990</DATE>, when the traps also must conform with <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> rules requiring larger escape vents to protect smaller-than-legal-size lobster. 

   Some say the real reason for the griping is that <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION> lobstermen simply don't like anybody telling them what to do -- even if it's for their own good. 
One <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION> newspaper estimates that two million pounds of lobster, about <PERCENT>10%</PERCENT> of the annual catch, are lost each year to ghost traps. 
Others say its closer to 400,000 pounds. 

   <PERSON>William Brennan</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Department of Marine Resources</ORGANIZATION> commissioner, says the rule has been in the works for six years and stems from concerns expressed by the industry. 
The agency's advisory council, he says, decided that giving the lobstermen "six years to adjust to a change they recommended themselves is enough."

<HEAD>Panel To Hear Arguments On New U.S. Law</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   An international panel is to decide in <DATE>April</DATE> whether an American
law banning the import of undersized lobsters violates the Free
Trade Agreement between the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>.
   The panel, which was scheduled to hear arguments on the dispute
today, is to recommend a resolution in <DATE>mid-May</DATE> that could range
from leaving the law as it is to banning it altogether. The board
of three Americans and two Canadians could also call for a
compromise.
   ``Lobster fishing is the backbone of hundreds of coastal
communities in <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>. Millions and <MONEY>millions of dollars</MONEY> in lost
income are at stake,'' said <PERSON>John Kearney</PERSON>, who represents the
<ORGANIZATION>Maritime Fishermen's Union</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Nova Scotia</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Bob Brown</PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION>Maine Import-Export Lobster Dealers
Association</ORGANIZATION>, said the dispute is ``on everybody's lips on both
sides of the border.''
   At issue is a bill that President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> signed into law in
<DATE>December</DATE>, prohibiting the importation or interstate transportation
of lobsters that do not meet federal minimum-size standards.
   Lobsters that are shorter than 3\ inches from the eye socket to
where the tail begins are illegal under the new law. By <DATE>1992</DATE>, the
minimum legal size will be 3 5-16 inches.
   But in <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>, lobster fishermen can catch lobsters 1-16th of an
inch shorter than those allowed in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>.
   Lobstermen, dealers and industry observers throughout <LOCATION>New
England</LOCATION> and the Canadian Maritime provinces say the panel's
decision could have a major impact on the industry.
   ``It could change the way lobsters are marketed,'' and more
significantly might change the way the government regulates lobster
management, said <ORGANIZATION>University of Southern Maine</ORGANIZATION> Professor <PERSON>Charles
Colgan</PERSON>, a former state economist.
   Canadian officials argue that the law is purely a trade barrier
that violates the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement. They say their
country has plenty of conservation laws, and the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> has
no right to tell them how to manage their resources.
   American lobstermen have complained to <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> that they could
not compete against the smaller, less expensive Canadian lobsters,
which were being shipped to American markets. The new law barring
the smaller lobsters could mean a potential loss to <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> of <MONEY>$20
million</MONEY> to <MONEY>$30 million</MONEY> in exports each year.
   American officials maintain that the law will protect the
lobster population by allowing more lobsters to live long enough to
reproduce.
   The new law as written will help American dealers protect their
domestic markets, but it also could lead to the loss of foreign
markets, industry sources say.
   Maine dealers previously could buy smaller lobsters from <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>
and pack them for shipment to out-of-state markets. The new law
prohibits that practice, and <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New England</LOCATION> exporters are
making changes to adapt to the law.
   The board hearing the dispute could call for a compromise that
would allow imports only to American export companies or only
during certain times of the year, or to place quotas on undersize
lobster imports.
   The panel's decision would not be binding, but both countries
are obligated to honor it under provisions of the Free Trade
Agreement.
   It is only the second time since the Free Trade Agreement was
enacted on <DATE>Jan. 1, 1989</DATE> that a panel has convened to resolve a
trade dispute.

<HEAD>Lobster Pound To Test Nationwide TV Sales Venture</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   With <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION>'s rockbound coast in the
background, Captain <PERSON>Owen Beal</PERSON> hauls a trap over the side of his
lobster boat and makes his pitch to television viewers in a thick
Down East accent.
   ``You can have your lobster within 24 hours from <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION>'s clear,
cool ocean waters,'' says <PERSON>Beal</PERSON>, in a 60-second spot scheduled to
debut within the next month on cable TV stations in various major
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> markets.
   Beal, clad in a yellow slicker, tells viewers that all they have
to do is dial a toll-free telephone number if they want ``the
tastiest lobsters in the world'' on their dinner table.
   The ads will mark a 30-day trial of what is billed as the first
television sales and distribution network to guarantee home or
office delivery of live <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION> lobsters anywhere in the nation
within 24 hours.
   The venture represents a merger of modern high-tech
telemarketing systems and a 75-year-old lobster pound operated in
this small eastern <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION> fishing village by <PERSON>Sidney Look</PERSON>, the fourth
Look generation to run the business.
   The idea originated two years ago when <PERSON>Ed Dugay</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Cherryfield</LOCATION>,
a pilot who flies spotter planes for herring fishermen, brought
<LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION> products such as lobsters, blueberries and sardines as gifts
on a visit to his brother in <LOCATION>Nashville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Tenn</LOCATION>.
   ``He's involved in a lot of telemarketing,'' <PERSON>Dugay</PERSON> said of his
brother, <PERSON>Mike</PERSON>, and ``a lightbulb went on.'' The two brothers hit
upon the TV marketing plan and approached Look with it.
   ``It's a great marriage really. Sid has three lobster pounds and
a lot of inventory, and we're kind of acting as consultants,''
<PERSON>Dugay</PERSON> said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
   Operators in <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> will process telephone orders and feed them
into a computer. Between <TIME>midnight</TIME> and dawn, the data will be
transmitted along telephone lines to a recently-installed bank of
computers on the second floor of Look's shingled packing house at
the end of a wharf.
   At the start of the workday, the orders are printed out and the
lobsters are packed. At the same time, credit card numbers debit
customers' accounts and copies of the orders appear on the main
<ORGANIZATION>Federal Express</ORGANIZATION> computer in <LOCATION>Memphis</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Tenn</LOCATION>.
   A truck arrives at <TIME>4 p.m.</TIME> to pick up the lobsters, which are
shipped from <LOCATION>Bangor International Airport</LOCATION> before sunset.
   Launching the business from this village of 1,200 in a remote
section of the <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION> coast forced the Dugays to overcome some
hurdles. Overnight shippers had no daily <ORGANIZATION>Federal Express</ORGANIZATION> service to
<LOCATION>Jonesport</LOCATION> before the inauguration of Look's Lobster Line.
   Likewise, <LOCATION>Jonesport</LOCATION> had no touch-tone phones, relying on rotary
dials or communication through an operator. Because computers
require touch-tone systems, Dugay had to add a conversion device to
the modem linking his phone line to the computer.
   Dugay says the markets for the initial ads still are being
selected, but he expects <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> to be among them. The
minimum order will be for six, 1-pound to 1\-pound lobsters, at a
total cost of <MONEY>$89</MONEY>, plus <MONEY>$10</MONEY> for shipping and handling.
   If the lobster line proves successful, <PERSON>Dugay</PERSON> says he is prepared
to offer other eastern <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION> products, including quahogs, mussels
and blueberries.

ON THE WATERFRONT: THE INS, OUTS OF LOBSTER SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
When lobster season opened <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, <PERSON>Dale Sleight</PERSON> was ready. He and his wife, 
<PERSON>Trudy</PERSON>, have spent the past two months building new traps and repairing old ones 
for the beginning of the six-month season. And <PERSON>Sleight</PERSON>, one of an estimated 25 
commercial lobstermen in <LOCATION>Orange County</LOCATION>, has been busy this week setting 150 
steel traps up and down the coast, hoping to snare his share of the delectable, 
but elusive, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> spiny lobster. 
</P>
<P>
The local lobsters will soon start showing up regularly in seafood markets, 
where they sell for <MONEY>$8</MONEY> to <MONEY>$9</MONEY>, and restaurants. But while lobster season means 
good eating for diners, it means a lot of hard work for fishermen like Sleight. 
</P>
<P>
Every day from <DATE>October</DATE> through mid-March, <LOCATION>Sleight</LOCATION>, a dory fisherman in <LOCATION>Newport 
Beach</LOCATION>, launches his 18-foot boat an hour before dawn and heads out to sea with 
about 100 pounds of bait. For the next nine hours or so, he makes a 60-mile 
loop, stopping at each trap to re-bait and to retrieve and measure his catch. 
Lobsters that do not measure at least 3 1/4 inches along the length of their 
backs (from eye socket to the rear edge of the shell) must be thrown back. The 
typical lobster runs about one to two pounds. 
</P>
<P>
For Sleight, the average daily haul is about 60 "bugs," as the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> 
lobsters are popularly called. Other lobstermen may set as many as 500 traps, 
according to <PERSON>Mike Castleton</PERSON>, a warden with the <ORGANIZATION>California Department of Fish</ORGANIZATION> 
and Game. For commercial lobstermen, there is no quantity limit. 
</P>
<P>
"I only like to fish 150 traps because I can handle those myself every day," 
says <PERSON>Sleight</PERSON>, who admits that lobstering is a tough business. "It is not the 
glamorous job everyone thinks it is. It is cold and miserable." 
</P>
<P>
The biggest problem in the lobstering business is poachers. 
</P>
<P>
Sleight sometimes stations his wife, <PERSON>Trudy</PERSON>, on the cliffs near <LOCATION>Laguna Beach</LOCATION> 
with binoculars to watch the white floats that mark his traps. If she spots 
someone trying to pull up the traps, she calls officials at the <ORGANIZATION>Department of 
Fish</ORGANIZATION> and Game. Harder to spot are the divers who often raid the traps under 
water, according to <LOCATION>Sleight</LOCATION>, who has been lobstering for 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
Some lobstermen work at land-bound jobs during the off season, while others, 
like Sleight, make their living year-round as fishermen. Anyone willing to pay 
<MONEY>$200</MONEY> for a permit, <MONEY>$50</MONEY> for a license and <MONEY>$165</MONEY> for a vessel permit can become a 
commercial lobsterman, according to <PERSON>Mike Castleton</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
If you don't want to trap lobsters commercially, but would like to snare two or 
three for dinner, you can purchase a one-day ocean sportfishing license for 
<MONEY>$6.50</MONEY> (or you can pay <MONEY>$11.75</MONEY> for a license good from day of purchase through 
the end of that calendar year) and try your luck with a hoop net, according to 
<PERSON>Castleton</PERSON>, who says he has caught many a lobster that way. Hoop nets, made of 
heavy netting strung between two metal rings, can be purchased at bait and 
tackle shops for about <MONEY>$24.95</MONEY>. You tie your bait in the center of the net and 
then lower the net from the 
</P>
<P>
jetty or a boat. Leave it down for about 15 to 20 minutes, then haul it up and 
check it for lobsters. Each person is limited to seven lobsters per day. 
</P>
<P>
If you are a diver, you can take lobsters legally by hand. Limit is seven 
lobsters per person, and a fishing license is required. Lobsters are found in 
15 to 60 feet of water and are most often found in crevices, caves and near 
small openings in the rocks. . 
</P>
<P>
Cruising the channels: <ORGANIZATION>Orange Coast College</ORGANIZATION> is offering a cruise to the Channel 
Islands aboard the <ORGANIZATION>Alaska Eagle</ORGANIZATION>, the school's 65-foot oceangoing yacht. 
</P>
<P>
The cruise is limited to nine students, and participants must have at least 
intermediate-level sailing experience. Each night is spent anchored in a cove 
at one of the islands, and there is ample time for exploring ashore. Cost is 
<MONEY>$360</MONEY> per person, including food. 
</P>
<P>
The participants meet from <TIME>9:30 a.m.</TIME> to <TIME>5 p.m.</TIME> <DATE>Saturday, Oct. 14</DATE> and <DATE>Oct. 21</DATE>, 
for sail training and cruise planning. The cruise departs <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, <DATE>Oct. 25</DATE>, 
and returns on <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, <DATE>Oct. 29</DATE>. For information call (714) 432-5880.

   A Fig Leaf a Day 

   Keeps the Doctor Away 

   CHIMPS discover a powerful antibiotic, say amazed human scientists. 

   It may sound like a headline from a supermarket tabloid, but it's true. 
The chimps' discovery was brought to light by <PERSON>Richard Wrangham</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Harvard University</ORGANIZATION> anthropologist who studies the behavior of African chimpanzees and other animals in the wild. 

   Years ago he noticed an odd chimp behavior -- the animals occasionally picked leaves off a certain plant, then swallowed them whole. 
Examination of the animals' droppings showed the leaves weren't digested, suggesting they weren't eaten for nutrition. 
"The idea finally hit me that the chimps were taking medicine," says <PERSON>Mr. Wrangham</PERSON>. 

   How they learned to do that is a mystery. 
But why they do it was clarified in <DATE>1985</DATE> when <PERSON>Mr. Wrangham</PERSON> asked <PERSON>Eloy Rodriguez</PERSON>, a biochemist at the <ORGANIZATION>University of California</ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION>Irvine</LOCATION>, to analyze the leaves, which are from a plant called Aspilia. 
Sure enough, they were found to contain a chemical that, in test-tube studies, kills certain worms, fungi and shows "some activity against viruses," says <PERSON>Mr. Rodriguez</PERSON>. 
Recently the scientists identified another probable chimp medicine -- young fig leaves, in which they found a substance previously known as a remedy for psoriasis and other skin disorders. 

   Several drug companies are interested, says <PERSON>Mr. Rodriguez</PERSON>, but the potential for human medicines remains uncertain. 
The most likely near-term benefit from the research is the use of the plants as remedies for farm animals in the Third World, he adds. 

   Biodegradable Traps 

   To Boost Lobster Catch 

   MANY LOBSTERS are alive and well and living in lost traps, say <ORGANIZATION>University of Maine</ORGANIZATION> researchers. 
During the past two years, the scientists have studied "ghost lobster traps" -- lost ones that sit on the ocean floor after lines to them are severed by storms, passing boats and other strains. 
The contraptions, these days made of plastic-coated wire, can snare lobsters for a decade or more when lost. 
That lessens the lobster catch and, more seriously, has been thought to take crucial breeding lobsters out of action. 

   The researchers estimate that as many as 50,000 traps are lost annually by <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION> lobstermen alone. 
Only an estimated <PERCENT>20%</PERCENT> of lobsters wandering into them escape the traps' "kitchens," or entrances, and fewer still get out of the "parlors," or main compartments. 
"Every time I've come across a ghost trap when diving, there's been a lobster in it," says <PERSON>George Kupelian</PERSON>, a graduate student and the study's coordinator. 

   Using underwater videocameras, the scientists have found that lobsters trapped in the ghosts stay alive by eating mostly fish and crabs that come into the traps. 
That's important because it indicates traps with biodegradable panels that corrode away after a few months underwater would effectively prevent loss of lobsters. 
The study may help persuade lobstermen to abide by a <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION> law that will require use of such traps beginning next year. 

   The study also exploded a myth -- that cannibalism is rife among trapped lobsters, worsening the lobster losses. 
In fact, trapped lobsters eat each other only rarely, such as after molting when they are soft and vulnerable, researchers found. 

   Scientists Doubt Claim 

   On Superconductivity 

   RESEARCHERS have reported a new superconductor temperature breakthrough, but few scientists are buying it. 

   The report, by <ORGANIZATION>Wayne State University</ORGANIZATION> researchers, follows a rash of similar claims two years ago -- including one from <LOCATION>Wayne State</LOCATION>, in <LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION> -- that couldn't be duplicated. 
Now scientists treat such reports as if they were claims of little green men landing in <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION>. 

   But the <ORGANIZATION>Wayne State</ORGANIZATION> group asserts its finding differs from the earlier ones. 
The scientists, who are collaborating with <ORGANIZATION>Ford Motor Co.</ORGANIZATION>, say a yttrium-containing compound that they made repeatedly lost electrical resistance -- the hallmark of superconductivity -- in tests over 11 days at temperatures above minus 64 degrees Fahrenheit. 
"To the best of our ability, we think we have checked" all sources of error and ruled them out, says <ORGANIZATION>Wayne State</ORGANIZATION> physicist <PERSON>Lowell Wenger</PERSON>. 

   If confirmed, the finding would be a major leap for superconductivity, which promises better computers and other electrical devices. 
The highest temperature now known for the phenomenon is minus 234 degrees Fahrenheit. 

   At least two groups, at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Houston and Princeton University</ORGANIZATION>, are trying to replicate the <ORGANIZATION>Wayne State</ORGANIZATION> experiment. 
Confirmation will be hard, though the compounds are made in pure oxygen at high pressures and only <PERCENT>30%</PERCENT> to <PERCENT>40%</PERCENT> of samples work in tests so far, says <PERSON>Mr. Wenger</PERSON>. 
Meanwhile, most superconductor researchers say they have better things to do. 
"We still look askance" at such claims, says <PERSON>Gregory Yurek</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>American Superconductor Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Cambridge</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION>, start-up. 

   Odds and Ends 

   CLAUSTROPHOBIC patients often freak out in MRI scanners, which confine people in a coffin-sized space while taking pictures of internal organs. 
So hospitals increasingly outfit patients with special glasses and mirrors to fill their vision with outdoor pictures while in the machines, says the <ORGANIZATION>American Hospital Association. . . . 
Boston</ORGANIZATION> researchers hope soon to begin clinical tests with a cow-blood extract as a temporary substitute for human red-blood cells. 
<ORGANIZATION>Biopure Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, which is developing the substitute, also plans to sell it for dogs and cats.

<HEAD>Bush Signs Lobster Protection Bill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> signed legislation <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>
banning the import of undersized lobsters.
   The bill was backed by <LOCATION>New England</LOCATION> lawmakers who presented it
both as a conservation measure and as a way to protect <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
fishermen against Canadian competitors harvesting smaller lobsters.
   The lobster provision is contained in the <MONEY>$400 million</MONEY>
authorization bill for the <ORGANIZATION>National Oceanic</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Atmospheric
Administration</ORGANIZATION>.
   Senate Majority Leader <PERSON>George Mitchell</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-Maine</LOCATION>, and <PERSON>Sen.
William S. Cohen</PERSON>, <LOCATION>R-Maine</LOCATION>, first sponsored the provision after
<LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION> fishermen complained about Canadian competition.
   Fishermen argue that <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>'s smaller minimum legal size of
lobsters has allowed Canadian fishermen to catch and sell smaller,
cheaper lobsters in <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> markets.
   The legislation signed by <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> would place a market representing
roughly half of <ORGANIZATION>Candada</ORGANIZATION>'s lobster exports off limits for the sale
of ``short'' lobsters.
   The current minimum legal size in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> is 3\ inches
from the eye socket to the edge of the back where the tail begins.
The Canadian minimum is one-sixteenth of an inch smaller.
   Up to now, <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> law has not regulated the size of imported
lobsters.
   In coming years, <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> regulations would gradually increase the
minimum size of a lobster that could be caught in <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> waters.
   Because <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> would not be bound by the increased minimum size
regulation, its fishermen could continue to deplete the harvest and
compete unfairly with their <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> counterparts, lobster fishermen
argued.

representative of the <ORGANIZATION>Maine Lobstermen's Association</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``We were successful, but we paid for it dearly,'' <PERSON>Cousens</PERSON> said.
``But we put our point across and that's what we wanted to do. We
didn't want to drive dealers out of business.''
   Cousens estimated up to 400 lobster boats participated at one
time or another during the strike, which began <DATE>Sept. 9</DATE> and ended
<DATE>Monday</DATE>. About 1,000 people have lobster-fishing licenses in the
affected area, the middle coast of <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION>.
   Lobstermen staged the strike in hopes of raising the price paid
by dealers for lobster from <MONEY>$2.10</MONEY> per pound to the <MONEY>$2.25</MONEY> per pound
lobstermen to the north and south receive, said <PERSON>Edward Blackmore</PERSON>,
president of the <ORGANIZATION>Maine Lobstermen's Association</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``There's no signed agreements or anything, but it was
understood by the group involved they were going to go back and get
prices at the <MONEY>$2.25</MONEY> level, which is what they thought they (needed
to) operate and make a living at,'' <PERSON>Blackmore</PERSON> said.

FT  26 MAR 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Olwyn and the giant lobsters - Kieran Cooke
risked being brained by a coconut, all in the cause of food
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Hitler Ho used to be a regular caller to the late-night radio request
programme in <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION>. Wagon <PERSON>Lee</PERSON>, presumably a man with a penchant for the
overnight services of the European railway system, was a columnist on a
local paper.
Names are peculiar things. The gender of my own is often confused - once,
this led to being confined overnight in the women's cabin section of a
Swedish ferry.
So what about the name <PERSON>Olwyn</PERSON>? The very picture of Welsh womanhood.
Healthy-cheeked, leek-eating, daffodil-growing. Wind from the Beacons
blowing through blond hair. Chapel on <DATE>Sunday</DATE> evenings. Cardiff Arms Park
with the lads. <PERSON>Dylan Thomas</PERSON>. The Eisteddfod.
Not this <PERSON>Olwyn</PERSON>, though. <PERSON>Olwyn Weerasekara</PERSON> is a man. A native of that magical
but, sadly, strife-filled island of <LOCATION>Sri Lanka</LOCATION>. He is also keeper of one of
the world's more unusual restaurants.
'I think maybe my father had a Welsh girlfriend once and decided I should
commemorate her,' says <PERSON>Olwyn</PERSON>. The name has never bothered him. He gets on
with what he knows best - cooking and sharing drinks and chat with
customers.
Olwyn's - or the <LOCATION>Beach Wadiya</LOCATION> restaurant - is on the open-sided
three-wheeler. Turn off the main road going south. Go down a dusty,
pot-holed track towards the sea. Take a left. A few desultory fairy lights
blink in the distance. 'Olwyn's,' says the driver. You stop and make sure
there are no hoots from oncoming locomotives.
The <LOCATION>Beach Wadiya</LOCATION> is on the other side of the railway tracks, perched on a
strip of sand between the trains and the sea. Levering the flesh out of a
crab claw might be interrupted by the very close rumble of the southern
express.
Olwyn's speciality is lobster. Lots of them. Grilled, poached, fried - with
butter and garlic, with chilli, with curry. <LOCATION>Colombo</LOCATION>'s aficionados ring
beforehand to place their orders. Then, they know they can be sure of
<PERSON>Olwyn</PERSON>'s personal touch in the cooking.
Later, being partial to a drink or two, <PERSON>Olwyn</PERSON> tends to be pre-occupied
elsewhere, mainly in the cut and thrust of intellectual conversation at
various tables littered round the sand. 'What is life for but to enjoy a few
fragile moments like this?' he says. The train goes past, making the
restaurant - and life - seem very fragile.
'Of course, people come here for the food, but it's not just that - it's
more for the, how shall I say . . .' His verbal meanderings are interrupted
by a slight hubbub at one table. A coconut has dropped from a tree, nearly
flattening the bald-headed diner underneath.
With commendable sang-froid, <PERSON>Olwyn</PERSON> waves at the rather startled gathering
and tells the waiter to take a jug of the local coconut toddy across.
'Nothing like good, strong toddy for putting the world right,' he says, with
a sharp slap of the thigh and a hearty roar of laughter.
The lobsters arrive. Two of them, stretching across the table. But I am not
allowed to eat. First, I have to examine the weighty books of customers'
comments.
Sample: 'I am from the <ORGANIZATION>USA</ORGANIZATION>. I have not eaten yet. But look forward to my
prawns. I hope on my next visit I can write in your guest book again and
tell you how good the food was or was not. Regards, <PERSON>RM Schwartz</PERSON>.'
<PERSON>Schwartz</PERSON> has no other entry. Perhaps the prawns were not up to scratch. More
likely, the toddy froze his literary abilities. Or he was brained by a stray
coconut.
I crack a lobster claw, but <PERSON>Olwyn</PERSON> wants to show me the pictures. A group of
very red-faced diners. 'The <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> cricket team - they all came here and
stayed till very late. We even had some bowling on the beach.'
Perhaps googlies go better with toddy.
'Olwyn, I really must get back to my lobster.'
'All in good time. Life should not be rushed. Now look at these pictures.'
Olwyn is a fan of the late Elvis. So, he had an Elvis lookalike competition
at <LOCATION>Beach Wadiya</LOCATION>. It was one of the highpoints of the restaurant's existence.
Lobster, toddy and rock-a-hula-baby.
A frisson of excitement runs among the tables. <LOCATION>Sri Lanka</LOCATION> is playing host to
Miss World Tourism. Several of the girls have found their way to <PERSON>Olwyn</PERSON>'s.
Each one of them 6ft tall, most of it legs.
Olwyn jumps like one of his crustaceans on the way to the griddle. 'So
honoured ladies. Of course we have room.'
There is only one table with space. Mine - at present occupied only by two
sadly neglected lobsters.
On one side, <LOCATION>Miss Poland</LOCATION>. On the other, <LOCATION>Miss Latvia</LOCATION>.
'Kieran? But that is a girl's name, yes?' says <LOCATION>Miss Poland</LOCATION>, in a tone that
brooks no contradictory opinion.
'Olwyn?' says <LOCATION>Miss Latvia</LOCATION>. 'That is a very sweet name. It is a <LOCATION>Sri Lankan</LOCATION>
name, no?'
Olwyn waves for more toddy. The train goes past. The lobsters do a <PERSON>Fred
Astaire</PERSON> on the table.
'We will eat your lobsters,' says the long legs from <LOCATION>Warsaw</LOCATION>.
'You are so kind,' says the twinkling <LOCATION>Miss Latvia</LOCATION> to <PERSON>Olwyn</PERSON>.
Beach <PERSON>Wadiya</PERSON>, 2 Station Avenue, <LOCATION>Wellawatte</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Sri Lanka</LOCATION>. Tel: <LOCATION>Colombo</LOCATION> 588568.

<HEAD>Rotting Herring Killing Lobsters</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   In life and death, thousands of pounds
of <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> herring have been eating up the oxygen in <LOCATION>Block
Island</LOCATION>'s Old Harbor _ and stinking up the local lobster industry.
   Local officials <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> sought state help for lobstermen who
lost an undetermined amount of catch when the herring depleted the
small harbor's oxygen supply. About 10-15 commercial lobstermen
operate from the harbor.
   Restaurants on the tourism-dependent island also lost lobsters
stored in tanks that circulate harbor water.
   <PERSON>Andrew Hunt</PERSON>, an aide to Lt. Gov. <PERSON>Roger Begin</PERSON>, said he was trying
to arrange relief funds or low-interest loans for those affected.
   Experts believe a large school of small fish entered the
harbor's inner basin, on the island's east side, on <DATE>June 4</DATE>.
   ``What we think happened is a school of <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> herring
possibly was chased into the basin in the Old Harbor area by
predators. It could be bluefish or striped bass,'' said <PERSON>Joseph
Migliore</PERSON>, a scientist with the state <ORGANIZATION>Department of Environmental
Management</ORGANIZATION>.
   The small fish has a fast metabolism and consumes a lot of
oxygen. The school, estimated to weigh 15,000 to 50,000 pounds,
apparently overwhelmed the seven-acre basin and its oxygen supply.
   Such fish kills are relatively common in enclosed bodies of
water. But Block Islanders can't remember such a large kill on
their isolated dot 12 miles off the <LOCATION>Rhode Island</LOCATION> coast.
   ``As far as I know, and I've talked to people who've been
fishing out of that harbor all their lives, 15 to 30 years, this
has never happened,'' said <PERSON>Chris Littlefield</PERSON>, harbor master for <LOCATION>New
Shoreham</LOCATION>, the island's only town.
   <ORGANIZATION>First Warden Edward McGovern</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>New Shoreham</LOCATION>'s equivalent of a
mayor, said the smell got really bad <DATE>last week</DATE>, but is improving.
   As the fish began dying, lobstermen collected about 50 barrels
for bait. But most of the dead fish sank to the bottom and began to
rot _ further depleting the oxygen.
   Unsuspecting lobstermen left their catch in cages filled with
harbor water _for storage until shipment to market _ and some think
the lobsters suffocated.
   Lobsters in restaurant tanks suffered similar fates. At least
some eateries were seeking an alternative storing method until the
harbor oxygen is restored.
   Experts could not estimate the extent of the damage or predict
when the harbor would return to normal.
   <PERSON>Littlefield</PERSON> said some of the dead fish were beginning to be
swept out with the tide, but most were staying on the bottom.

FISHERMEN SAY ENCINITAS REFUGE WOULD DEVASTATE THEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
<PERSON>Randy Miller</PERSON> has been a commercial fisherman for a quarter of a century, plying 
his trade up and down the <LOCATION>North County</LOCATION> coast in his 26-foot boat, the <LOCATION>Seaway</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
It is not an easy business. Even with tricks of the trade gleaned from years on 
the water, <PERSON>Miller</PERSON> wages a constant battle to keep fiscally afloat. There are 
the whims of the weather, problems with poachers and the perpetual toll of the 
elements on boat and equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Now comes a new challenge. Little more than a week ago, state legislation was 
introduced that would create a marine refuge along a half-mile strip of 
coastline in <LOCATION>Encinitas</LOCATION>, effectively putting it off-limits to commercial and 
sport fishermen, as well as divers looking for dinner. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ecologically Rich Area 
</P>
<P>
The bill, written by Assemblywoman Sunny Mojonnier (R-Encinitas) and championed 
by city officials, is designed to protect in perpetuity the ecologically rich 
area, prohibiting the harvest of all manner of marine life from the tide pools 
to a mile offshore. 
</P>
<P>
Miller, however, sees the proposal as yet another shot across the bow of his 
profession. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the best fishing reef in <LOCATION>North County</LOCATION>, bar none, absolute, period," 
<PERSON>Miller</PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION>Southern California Lobster Fisherman's Assn.</ORGANIZATION>, said 
one recent day. "It's a mortal blow to local fishermen. It would be 
devastating." 
</P>
<P>
The unfriendly reception the legislation has received from local fishermen, who 
promise to fight the bill to the end, has taken <LOCATION>Encinitas</LOCATION> officials as well as 
Mojonnier by surprise. The proposal has been in the works since mid-1988 and, 
until now, no one had uttered a word of disapproval, they say. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nothing we've hidden. This thing is months and months old," said <PERSON>David 
Wigginton</PERSON>, the city's community services director. "I think the fishermen have 
to look out for their interests, and I'm sure their concerns will be heard. . . 
. The intent wasn't to jeopardize anyone's welfare, the intent was to preserve 
an area of coastline for all people to enjoy." 
</P>
<P>
The legislation would establish an ocean sanctuary stretching south from D 
Street at <LOCATION>Moonlight Beach</LOCATION> to the southern edge of Swami's, a popular surfing 
spot noted for an extensive reef system that stretches well beyond the 
breakers. 
</P>
<P>
A rugged ocean outcropping, the reef serves as a feeding ground for a wide 
array of fish, and harbors perhaps the most abundant crop of lobster north of 
<ORGANIZATION>La Jolla Cove</ORGANIZATION>, which is already designated a marine refuge. Moreover, the tide 
pools that appear as the ocean recedes each day play host to sea anemones, 
crabs, sea cucumbers and other flora and fauna of the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"At low tide it's beautiful," <PERSON>Wigginton</PERSON> said. "There's everything imaginable 
out there. You don't see the same things twice." 
</P>
<P>
The bill was sparked by <ORGANIZATION>Encinitas City Councilman Gerald Steel</ORGANIZATION>, who pushed 
through a unanimous resolution in <DATE>July</DATE>, asking that the sanctuary be 
established. Steel has since moved to <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> state. 
</P>
<P>
Given his marching orders, <PERSON>Wigginton</PERSON> approached <PERSON>Mojonnier</PERSON>'s office with the 
idea. <ORGANIZATION>State Department of Fish</ORGANIZATION> and Game officials were consulted, and they 
advised the assemblywoman that the quickest avenue to secure a refuge would be 
through the Legislature instead of the cumbersome bureaucratic process. 
</P>
<P>
State law protects about three dozen ocean sanctuaries. While the zones are 
open for scientific and recreational purposes, they are off-limits to fishermen 
and divers, with a strict look-but-don't-take rule enforced. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Vernon Goehring</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>DFG</ORGANIZATION>'s legislative coordinator, said the agency has yet to 
take a position on <DATE>Mojonnier</DATE>'s bill, but suggested that the region off 
<LOCATION>Encinitas</LOCATION> is not a unique habitat nor does it play host to a specific plant or 
animal threatened by extinction. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Endangered Species 
</P>
<P>
"There's no particular species that's endangered there," <PERSON>Goehring</PERSON> said. "I'm 
not saying protection of tide pools isn't important, but it isn't to a point 
where there is an endangered species that is native only to that particular 
location." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Mia Tegner</PERSON>, a marine ecologist with the <ORGANIZATION>Scripps Institution of Oceanography</ORGANIZATION> in 
<LOCATION>La Jolla</LOCATION>, said she is unfamiliar with the spot under consideration, but 
supports the concept of marine refuges as a way of protecting the fragile ocean 
ecosystem. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the general idea of reserves is a good one," she said. "It would be 
nice to take my grandchildren out and show them what an abalone looks like." 
</P>
<P>
Tegner noted, however, that the sector "may well be the <LOCATION>North County</LOCATION> hot spot" 
for fishermen, meaning the anglers have "a legitimate gripe here." 
</P>
<P>
"If fishermen say they have to have every square inch of coast, it's one thing, 
but if they say this particular spot is a source of livelihood, it's another," 
<PERSON>Tegner</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
Local fishermen, meanwhile, make no bones about it -- the stretch of ocean off 
central <LOCATION>Encinitas</LOCATION> is the prime ocean acreage for anglers and lobster men in 
<LOCATION>North County</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Would Be a Disaster' 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of guys who make their living off Swami's," said <PERSON>John Guth</PERSON>, a 
lobster fisherman for more than 20 years. "This would be a disaster for us. 
We've already had so many closures. If they take another, there's just not 
going to be that much there." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Jack Perdew</PERSON>, a lobster fisherman out of <LOCATION>Oceanside Harbor</LOCATION>, agreed. "I would rate 
it one of the best, if not the best," he said. "I hope the thing doesn't go 
through. I'm sorry that our legislators don't have the courtesy of checking 
with the people it would most affect." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Miller</PERSON>, a third-generation <LOCATION>Encinitas</LOCATION> resident and chief spokesman for the local 
lobster fishermen, suggested that the key flaw of the proposal is that it 
underestimates the ability of the ocean to renew itself when properly handled. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got to ask why we are saving it," <PERSON>Miller</PERSON> argued. "Just to look at? The 
ocean is renewable if we manage it properly. It can serve the fisherman and the 
general public. To have it for one interest group is like saying the rest of us 
aren't good enough. . . . It's kind of utopian. They want to create a private 
pond off the city." 
</P>
<P>
As a child, <PERSON>Miller</PERSON> lived with his family on the bluff overlooking <ORGANIZATION>Swami's</ORGANIZATION>. He 
recalls the days when a small wooden wharf extended from the rocky point. 
Miller grew up with fishermen all around. Later, he became a surfer, but turned 
to fishing for his livelihood when he realized his skills on a board would not 
put bread on the table. 
</P>
<P>
He recalls years past when the lobster population off the coast had dwindled to 
record lows. A fisherman could throw as many traps as he'd like into the water, 
but the things would generally come up empty. The area was all but fished out. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Young Ones Can Escape 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, lobster have rebounded, most notably because of new traps that 
allow the younger and smaller crustaceans, which will grow into next year's 
whoppers, to escape through a portal in the steel mesh, he said. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the past six years have been very good, said <PERSON>Miller</PERSON>, who also 
fishes for shark, sea bass, yellowtail and other fish after the close of 
lobster season, which begins the first <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> in <DATE>October</DATE> and lasts more than 
five months. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how we'll fight it," <PERSON>Miller</PERSON> said. "We'll probably have to go up 
to <LOCATION>Sacramento</LOCATION> and deal with it there. It's not something that we haven't had to 
do before." 
</P>
<P>
Such talk aside, room for compromise may remain. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Wigginton</PERSON> said his impression of the original intent of the proposal is that it 
primarily sought to protect the tidal areas off <LOCATION>Encinitas</LOCATION>. By spreading the 
refuge boundaries a mile out to sea, the legislation may have unintentionally 
snared the fishermen. 
</P>
<P>
"If a mile is too far out, maybe we can negotiate it back in," he said. "But 
not having heard the concerns of those parties firsthand, it's hard to say what 
direction any action might take." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Chris Heiserman</PERSON>, an administrative assistant to Mojonnier, said the 
assemblywoman's staff was unaware of the fishermen's concern before introducing 
the legislation, but would be happy to arrange a meeting with all parties 
concerned. 
</P>
<P>
"We certainly want to hear these people out," <PERSON>Heiserman</PERSON> said. "If they've got a 
legitimate beef, we'll want to put that on the scale, too."

BETWEEN A ROCK AND A HARD PLACE IN LOBSTER MECCA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. GLIONNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For more than a quarter of a century, lobster fisherman <PERSON>John Guth</PERSON> has weathered 
all sorts of unkind elements in pursuit of the stubborn little crustacean that 
has put food on his table and those thick flannel shirts on his back. 
</P>
<P>
There are the unpredictable ocean currents that play havoc with his submerged 
traps. There are the gentle coastal breezes that, without a moment's notice, 
can become gales strong enough to make even a brawny powerboat stand still in 
the water. 
</P>
<P>
And then there are the lowly lobster poachers, the pirate divers who, under the 
cover of night, can fleece a whole set of traps, robbing local lobster 
fishermen of <MONEY>thousands of dollars</MONEY> a year. 
</P>
<P>
But now fishermen like Guth -- a rugged man with strong, steady hands -- are 
facing an element more fickle than anything the moody <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> could throw their 
way. 
</P>
<P>
Now, they say, they're doing battle with the whims of politicians. 
</P>
<P>
In <DATE>January</DATE>, following through on the brainchild of <ORGANIZATION>Encinitas City Council</ORGANIZATION> 
members, state legislators passed a bill to create an ocean sanctuary along a 
half-mile strip of coastline in the city, effectively putting it off-limits to 
commercial and sport fishermen, tide pool robbers, even divers looking for 
dinner. 
</P>
<P>
The new marine refuge stretches south from D Street at <LOCATION>Moonlight Beach</LOCATION> to the 
southern edge of Swami's Point, a popular surfing spot noted for an extensive 
reef system that stretches well beyond the breakers. The rugged ocean 
outcropping serves as a feeding ground for an array of fish, and it harbors 
perhaps the most abundant crop of lobster north of <ORGANIZATION>La Jolla Cove</ORGANIZATION>, which is 
already designated a marine reserve. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the tide pools that appear as the ocean recedes each day provide 
homes for sea anemones, crabs, sea cucumbers and other flora and fauna of the 
<LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation, sponsored by Assemblywoman Sunny Mojonnier (R-Encinitas), was 
designed to protect the ecologically rich coastline, prohibiting the harvesting 
of all manner of marine life from the tide pools and reefs up to 600 feet 
offshore. 
</P>
<P>
But self-employed fishermen such as Guth see the law as just another threat to 
their already beleaguered industry, locking them out of the fertile waters that 
provide their keep. 
</P>
<P>
"In this line of work, we're at the mercy of the elements, the thieves and the 
poachers and the unpredictable ocean," <PERSON>Guth</PERSON> said <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME> as he 
repaired lobster traps on the 35-foot <PERSON>Stephanie D</PERSON>, moored in <LOCATION>Oceanside Harbor</LOCATION>. 
"Now it's the politicians and bureaucrats as well. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been fishing those waters for generations and we've never harmed the 
ecosystem there. But as soon as <LOCATION>Encinitas</LOCATION> becomes a city, these new politicians 
want to go out and save the world. Well, this little part of the world has 
already been saved." 
</P>
<P>
The fishermen cite the <DATE>1972</DATE> Tidal Invertebrate Act, which protects most 
invertebrates within 1,000 feet of the shoreline. An exclusion in the act 
allows commercial and sport fishermen to harvest lobsters in the zone, as long 
as they keep to limits imposed by the state <ORGANIZATION>Department of Fish</ORGANIZATION> and Game. 
</P>
<P>
The fishermen hope to gain a similar exclusion for the marine refuge, which 
they say wasn't necessary in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like putting a stop sign in the middle of the desert," said <PERSON>Guth</PERSON>, a 
48-year-old <LOCATION>Encinitas</LOCATION> resident. "It's useless." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Chris Heiserman</PERSON>, administrative assistant for Mojonnier, said the intent of the 
legislation is not to put the lobstermen out of business. "That's not what we 
set out to do," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, several lobstermen met with <PERSON>Mojonnier</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Encinitas</LOCATION> city officials and 
marine life experts to strike a compromise that would allow them to continue 
plying their trade within the rich coastal waters. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, <PERSON>Mojonnier</PERSON> agreed to refer the law to legislative council in 
<LOCATION>Sacramento</LOCATION> to determine whether licensed fishermen should be allowed inside the 
protected area, as the lobstermen and their lawyer claim. 
</P>
<P>
The reefs are worth fighting for, fishermen say. The refuge is home to abundant 
numbers of lobsters because of the rocky clefts and crevices where the 
creatures seek cover. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not like we can fish the entire coast; there's only a few places that 
support the lobsters in those kind of numbers," <PERSON>Guth</PERSON> said. "And what's to stop 
the guy in <LOCATION>Solana Beach</LOCATION> or someplace else from wanting to put a refuge in front 
of his house -- where's it going to end?" 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Dave Wigginton</PERSON>, director of community services for <LOCATION>Encinitas</LOCATION>, said the refuge 
was intended to protect the tide pools that were being stripped by people 
walking on the beach at low tide. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman <PERSON>Anne Omsted</PERSON>, he said, had noticed a drastic reduction of marine 
life in the pools because of the "free-lance harvesting." 
</P>
<P>
While the lobstermen claim their harvests don't disrupt the fragile ecology, 
<PERSON>Wigginton</PERSON> said that city officials aren't so sure. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what they say, but I've been shown no proof one way or the other. I'm 
not a biologist," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials also worry that the dangerous traps sometimes drift ashore in bad 
weather or are a hazard to surfers, including one youth who was killed off 
<LOCATION>Carlsbad State Beach</LOCATION> in <DATE>1985</DATE> when his surfboard leash became tangled in a trap 
line. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, <PERSON>Wigginton</PERSON> said, there has already been compromise. The original scope 
of the refuge extended to a mile offshore. After the lobstermen complained, it 
was reduced to the present 600 feet, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Guth said many fishermen are miffed because they were never consulted over the 
new refuge. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't care what happens to us," he said. "We don't matter; we're just a 
few old dinosaurs, anyway." 
</P>
<P>
In an unusual alliance, the commercial lobstermen have even received support 
from the state <ORGANIZATION>Department of Fish</ORGANIZATION> and Game. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Phil Swartzell</PERSON>, a marine biologist for the agency, told officials at the recent 
meeting that he thought the refuge was redundant to existing state laws 
protecting the area. 
</P>
<P>
"We should have laws and regulations only to the extent that we achieve what 
we're trying to achieve. They shouldn't restrict beyond that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"If the objective is to have life in the tide pool area where people can 
examine invertebrates and plants in their environment, I don't think that 
having lobster fishermen in the area is going to affect that." 
</P>
<P>
One solution, officials say, would be to offer special permits to the dozen or 
so lobstermen who regularly harvest in the area. But the last thing Guth and 
others say they need is another permit. 
</P>
<P>
"I've already got 500 permits," he said. "We're under the gun all the time from 
all these agencies. It's just another club they have to hang over your head." 
</P>
<P>
Guth, who also fishes his 500 traps off <LOCATION>San Clemente Island</LOCATION>, says the plan will 
most likely affect the smaller-scale lobstermen whose boats are too tiny to 
venture very far from shore. 
</P>
<P>
"It means up to a third of their earnings," he said. "Some of them could go out 
of business, lose the livelihoods their fathers taught them." 
</P>
<P>
Some of them have already left. Last year, a good friend of <ORGANIZATION>Guth</ORGANIZATION>'s packed in 
his traps and moved to <LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION>. "He said he was sick and tired of dealing with 
all the politics," <PERSON>Guth</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
While reducing the pool of lobstermen in <LOCATION>North County</LOCATION> may be healthy in the 
long run, Guth doesn't want to see any veteran fishermen robbed of their 
hard-earned professions. 
</P>
<P>
"They're reducing our territory all the time," he said. "We're like a can of 
worms. Or a bunch of snapping lobsters in a trap." 
</P>
<P>
For now, officials say, they may be saved by the bell. Lobster season ends this 
month and doesn't open again until <DATE>October</DATE>. By then, they hope to have found a 
solution. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, officials say, they'll begin laying the buoys that will effectively 
wall off <LOCATION>North County</LOCATION> lobstermen from yet another fertile fishing ground. 
</P>
<P>
As he hauls his traps in for the <DATE>summer</DATE>, <PERSON>John Guth</PERSON> can only shake his head. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, he says, fishermen are their own worst enemies. They're loners who 
rarely agree on anything -- independent men with temperaments better fit for 
the open ocean, not <ORGANIZATION>City Council</ORGANIZATION> chambers. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why I became a fisherman," he said, "to get away from these 
well-intentioned but uninformed politicians who want to save the world."

<HEAD>New State Limits on Gill Net Fishing Anger Vietnamese Fishermen</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Almost 100 Vietnamese fishermen in <LOCATION>Boston Harbor</LOCATION>,
all former boat people, say they face the loss of their livelihood
this week because of new restrictions on their gill-net fishing
methods.
   But the lobstermen who lobbied the state to enact the new rules
say that it was their livelihood that was threatened by the fishing
method used by the Vietnamese.
   The dispute has led to tension between the two sides, including
one incident in which a lobsterman brandished gun at a Vietnamese
fisherman, the Vietnamese said.
   At issue are restrictions that went into effect this week on the
use in <LOCATION>Boston Harbor</LOCATION> of gill nets, which are set upright in the
water to catch fish by entangling their gills in their meshes.
Lobstermen said too many lobsters were being caught up in the nets.
   <PERSON>Alex Farent</PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION>Boston Lobsterman's Association</ORGANIZATION>, said
that ``if in any way this new regulation is not complied with, we
will kiss our livelihoods goodbye. That's it.''
   But to the Vietnamese fishermen, who began fishing in the area
<DATE>last fall</DATE>, losing their right to do so comes as an especially cruel
blow. Most of them grew up around boats in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>, and fishing is
their only real skill, said <PERSON>Mai T. Thoi</PERSON>, one of the few of the
fishermen who speaks English.
   ``The state government didn't consider our need to make a
living,'' said Thoi. ``If this regulation continues, there's no way
we can continue our way of life. We are now in an emergency
situation. We need a miracle.''
   Thoi and representatives of the lobstermen met with state
officials <DATE>Monday</DATE>, and <ORGANIZATION>Thoi</ORGANIZATION> was unable to persuade state officials
to relent.
   James Fair, assistant director of the <ORGANIZATION>Division of Marine
Fisheries</ORGANIZATION>, said gill-net fishing within <LOCATION>Boston Harbor</LOCATION> is allowed
during the winter, but lobsters often get tangled up in the gill
nets during the <DATE>summer</DATE> catch.
   The new regulations were initiated because a valuable resource,
lobsters, is in ``great danger,'' he said. Fair also said that the
Vietnamese, who are not licensed to catch lobsters, have sometimes
retrieved them in their nets.
   Before the rules went into effect, the Vietnamese fished within
three miles of the harbor. Now they must take their boats out about
10 miles into deep water, which they say is too dangerous with
their aging vessels.
   Fair also said the state wanted to stop the conflict between the
Vietnamese and the lobstermen before the tension escalated.
   Three weeks ago, <PERSON>Thoi</PERSON> said, several Vietnamese fishermen
reported being harassed and threatened by local lobstermen.
   <PERSON>Tung Phan</PERSON>, 21, a crew member on one of the boats, said <DATE>Monday</DATE>
that a lobsterman had pulled his boat near Phan's boat one day and
showed a knife, yelling at the crew members to ``get out.'' During
another incident, a lobsterman pulled a gun out and brandished it
from his boat, <PERSON>Phan</PERSON> said.
   ``It's ironic,'' said Thoi. ``We had to flee here and we were
trying to survive and now they're not letting us survive.''
   Fair said that state officials ``recognize that they were able
to fish like that in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>, but they have to realize that the
same techniques are not compatible with the way they do things in
<LOCATION>Boston Harbor</LOCATION>.''
   Thoi said the fishermen hope to continue their fight to be
allowed to fish in the harbor. He said, however, that ``we will
respect the law.''

FOOTLOOSE IN KENNEBUNKPORT: PRESIDENT'S FRIENDLY HOMETOWN OFFERS A FEW SIMPLE 
PLEASURES

KENNEBUNKPORT, Me. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Until <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON> began strolling through his hometown as a presidential 
candidate, about the last thing of note that had happened here was the 
Historical Society's recovery of the old fog bell from <LOCATION>Goat Island</LOCATION> lighthouse a 
few miles offshore in the <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
If you include being totally wiped out by Indians in <DATE>1689</DATE>, <LOCATION>Kennebunkport</LOCATION> has 
been home to a few historic events since its founding in <DATE>1653</DATE>. Yet during its 
300-plus years it has hardly been a <LOCATION>Lexington</LOCATION> or <LOCATION>Concord</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Farming, fishing and sawmills along inland streams and the <LOCATION>Kennebunk River</LOCATION> were 
the first economic activities. But by the beginning of the <DATE>19th Century</DATE> the 
shipbuilding industry was turning out 100 vessels a year. 
</P>
<P>
During the <DATE>first half of the 19th Century</DATE>, those affluent shipbuilders began 
putting up impressive homes in Greek Revival, <ORGANIZATION>Federal</ORGANIZATION>, Colonial and, later, 
Victorian styles. So in addition to being a lively <DATE>summer</DATE> resort, the little 
village has that old-fashioned, lived-in look of a <LOCATION>New England</LOCATION> seaside town. 
</P>
<P>
But good times or bad, one thing <LOCATION>Kennebunkport</LOCATION> has had going for it is natural 
beauty, sited as it is at the mouth of the <LOCATION>Kennebunk River</LOCATION> near the <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION>'s 
<LOCATION>Cape Porpoise Harbor</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Any way you look at it, President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s forebears were pretty smart folks to 
have settled here. 
</P>
<P>
To get here: Fly <ORGANIZATION>Delta</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>TWA</ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> to <LOCATION>Portland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Me.</LOCATION>, with changes. From 
there it's 30 minutes by car or bus on to <LOCATION>Kennebunkport</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
How long/how much? You can do the town's sights in a day, but with water 
sports, antique shopping and perhaps a bit of fishing, give it several days. 
Accommodations are moderately priced, up a notch for the <DATE>summer</DATE> season. Dining 
well is also moderate. 
</P>
<P>
A few fast facts: The busy season is from mid-June until mid-October. And a 
trolley makes the rounds of many hotels and the mid-village shopping area for a 
50-cent ticket. 
</P>
<P>
Getting settled in: Nonantum-Portside Resort (<LOCATION>Ocean Avenue</LOCATION>; <MONEY>$80</MONEY> to <MONEY>$125</MONEY> double) 
has a main hotel that is more than a century old, plus the new Portside also in 
traditional style but with water views from every room. There's a private 
marina, heated pool, tennis and golf nearby. 
</P>
<P>
Rooms in the newly restored main hotel are comfortably old-fashioned and 
freshly painted with wicker furniture, TVs and pretty flowered walls. Most of 
the Portside rooms have their own balcony with trim white banisters. The dining 
room has a good selection of seafood, pretty straightforward thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>Welby Inn</ORGANIZATION> (Ocean Avenue; <MONEY>$60</MONEY>-<MONEY>$80</MONEY> B&amp;B double) was built in <DATE>1900</DATE> by a 
prosperous sea captain. Seven rooms have handmade bedspreads, hooked-rag rugs, 
samplers on walls and flowers all over. Your breakfasts might consist of fresh 
fruit, eggs to order, apple-walnut bread, blueberry muffins and lots of tea or 
coffee. This charmer is owned and operated by the <PERSON>Knox</PERSON> family and is very 
popular, so write ahead for reservations. 
</P>
<P>
The Inn at <ORGANIZATION>Goose Rocks</ORGANIZATION> (Dyke Road; <MONEY>$75</MONEY>-<MONEY>$105</MONEY> double) is just outside town in a 
wooded setting overlooking saltwater marshes and near <ORGANIZATION>Goose Rocks Beach</ORGANIZATION>. The 
inn's 32 guest rooms are spread out in a traditional building, many of the 
rooms with four-posters. There's a pub lounge, deck area, pleasant library with 
plenty of books and a fireplace. The dining room has a blue-nautical motif, 
attractive stenciling on walls and good food and service. 
</P>
<P>
Shawmut Inn (<ORGANIZATION>Turbot</ORGANIZATION>'s Creek Road; <MONEY>$90</MONEY>-<MONEY>$150</MONEY> double) is right by the ocean, a 
huge complex built in <DATE>1913</DATE> with a main building, several other large ones and a 
clutch of separate cottages. A recreational director sees after things around 
the Olympic-size saltwater pool, volleyball, shuffleboard, jazz concerts on 
<DATE>Sunday</DATE>. All meals served, and a van takes you to and from the port area in 
town. 
</P>
<P>
Regional food and drink: You haven't really lived until you've dug into a fresh 
<LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION> lobster, the world's best, with a side of "steamers" (soft clams), corn 
on the cob and a bowl of slaw. These are the basics of a beachside clambake, 
but many restaurants also serve them. In addition to the steamers you may find 
quahogs, a mud-loving clam that makes great chowder. 
</P>
<P>
Apart from the lobster-clam headliners, look for sweet shrimp and scallops, 
baked, broiled or deep-fried. You might also scan menus for fresh ocean perch, 
pollack, cod, halibut, haddock, sole and shad roe in the <DATE>spring</DATE>. Nowhere will 
you find a greater variety of fresh seafood. 
</P>
<P>
Fruits show up in such favorites as apple crisps and apple pandowdy, blueberry 
and strawberry tarts and cobblers. Injun pudding is sure to destroy your daily 
calorie count, a heavy affair made of molasses, cornmeal, milk, sugar, butter 
and whatever seasonings the cook has on hand. 
</P>
<P>
Good dining: Cafe Topher (Lower Harbor Village) couldn't be prettier, a 
downstairs pub with piano music, upstairs a lovely room with crisp pink linens, 
pink flowers, etched-glass dividers and a grand piano. 
</P>
<P>
Lobster fettuccini heads the list of numerous seafood dishes, several steaks 
and chicken entrees for landlubbers. The dessert menu promises homemade fruit 
pies "often," cherries jubilee "never." 
</P>
<P>
The Lobster Pot (<ORGANIZATION>Mills Road</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Cape Porpoise</LOCATION>) always has a steady crowd of locals 
willing to take the three-mile ride out there for simple decor, paper napkins, 
ceiling fans and unadorned fresh seafood. Choose your live lobster from the 
tank: <MONEY>$10.95</MONEY> for a one-pounder, <MONEY>$16.95</MONEY> for two. Most folks also go for the 
steamers at <MONEY>$5.85</MONEY>. You may start with clam or fish chowder, rich lobster stew. 
</P>
<P>
Seascapes (Cape Porpoise Pier) is a really lovely restaurant right over the 
water, with pastel pottery and lots of flowers highlighting the attractive 
decor. It has a small bar and marvelous views of the water in one of <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION>'s 
prettiest fishing villages. 
</P>
<P>
The menu reaches out with the likes of shrimp a la turkolimani, sauteed with 
fresh tomatoes and feta cheese; scallops sauteed with arugula and lime pesto; 
lobster braised in Drambuie cream; <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION> crab cakes with tomato-rosemary sauce. 
</P>
<P>
On your own: <LOCATION>Eighteenth</LOCATION>- and <DATE>19th-Century</DATE> architecture buffs will have a field 
day here, with the <ORGANIZATION>Greek-Revival Nott House</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>White Columns</ORGANIZATION>, being the town 
showpiece. Built in <DATE>1853</DATE>, it still has original wallpapers, carpets and 
furnishings. A tour of this one is a must. 
</P>
<P>
Summer Street has a line of beautiful homes of the last two centuries, and the 
<DATE>1826</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>Wedding Cake House</ORGANIZATION>, built by a sea captain, is extraordinary in the true 
sense of the word. 
</P>
<P>
Sixteen antique shops in a small town are enough to set any antiquarian 
atwitter, so comb them for pewter, pine furniture, duck decoys, silver, 
scrimshaw, country cupboards and whatever else you absolutely need. 
</P>
<P>
Feisty striped bass draw fishermen to the mouth of the <LOCATION>Kennebunk</LOCATION> and Mousam 
rivers, while the deep-sea types head out on party boats for cod, mackerel, 
tuna and anything else biting in the <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> that day. 
</P>
<P>
And in this friendliest of all small towns, almost every hotel or inn has free 
bicycles to loan you, so strike out down the road and start meeting 
Kennebunkporters. You might even run into you-know-who taking a stroll. 
</P>
