<TEXT>
   The nation grew to 249.6 million people in the
<DATE>1980s</DATE> as more Americans left the industrial and agricultural
heartlands for the South and <LOCATION>West</LOCATION>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION>'s first ``final'' figures from the <DATE>1990</DATE>
census, released <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, showed the pull of the Sun Belt
remained strong, despite efforts by the industrial North to promote
growth and the collapse during the <DATE>1980s</DATE> of the oil and savings and
loan industries - two mainstays of the Southern and Western states.
   The census figures are used to adjust the number of
representatives each state sends to <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> so that political
clout is in line with population. The figures also determine the
division of federal money among states and localities.
   The numbers could change next <DATE>summer</DATE> when the <ORGANIZATION>Commerce
Department</ORGANIZATION> decides whether to adjust the count. Some states and
cities are likely to challenge the tallies, whichever way the
adjustment decision goes.
   More than 6,000 local governments challenged the accuracy of a
preliminary count based mainly on the <DATE>April 1</DATE> census taken by mail.
The <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> responded with a series of recounts and an ad
campaign urging people who thought they had been missed to come
forward.
   In <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, Mayor <PERSON>David Dinkins</PERSON> criticized the count released
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, saying it underestimated the city's population and as a
result will cost the city <MONEY>millions of dollars</MONEY> in federal funds each
year.
   ``Since at least <DATE>1940</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>Commerce Department</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Census
Bureau</ORGANIZATION> have systematically under counted Americans of color and
Americans who live in cities,'' <PERSON>Dinkins</PERSON> said at a <ORGANIZATION>City Hall</ORGANIZATION> news
conference.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION>'s final national population total was nearly 4
million people more than the preliminary number it released earlier
this year.
   Five states, all in the South or West, grew by more than a
fourth in the decade: <LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION>, up <PERCENT>50.7 percent</PERCENT>; <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION>, <PERCENT>37.4
percent</PERCENT>; <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>, <PERCENT>35.3 percent</PERCENT>; <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, <PERCENT>33.4 percent</PERCENT>; and
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, <PERCENT>26.1 percent</PERCENT>.
   The six states having growth of less than <PERCENT>1 percent</PERCENT> included
some industrial powerhouses: <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>, up <PERCENT>0.4 percent</PERCENT>;
<LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>, <PERCENT>0.5 percent</PERCENT>; <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>, <PERCENT>0.7 percent</PERCENT>; and <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, <PERCENT>0.8
percent</PERCENT>. Grain-growing <LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION> grew by a bare <PERCENT>0.9 percent</PERCENT>.
<LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION>, hard hit by the collapse in oil prices in the <DATE>1980s</DATE>,
grew <PERCENT>0.8 percent</PERCENT>.
   Five states lost population. The biggest percentage loser was
<LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION>, whose population dropped by <PERCENT>7.6 percent</PERCENT> to
1,801,625. Other states losing population were <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>, down <PERCENT>4.3
percent</PERCENT>; <LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION>, down <PERCENT>2.9 percent</PERCENT>; and <LOCATION>North Dakota</LOCATION>, down <PERCENT>1.7
percent</PERCENT>. The <ORGANIZATION>District of Columbia</ORGANIZATION> also lost population, <PERCENT>4.5
percent</PERCENT>.
   America's population grew at a slower pace in the <DATE>1980s</DATE> than in
decades past: <PERCENT>10.2 percent</PERCENT>, compared with <PERCENT>11.4 percent</PERCENT> in the <DATE>1970s</DATE>
and <PERCENT>13.4 percent</PERCENT> in the <DATE>1960s</DATE>.
   This year's population count, 249,632,692, for the first time
included some Americans living abroad. The <DATE>1980</DATE> population figure,
226,504,825, counted only people living within the nation's
borders.
   <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>'s release was only the first burst of what will be a
barrage of census numbers detailing not only the number of people
but their ages, races, housing situations, incomes and a wealth of
other data.
   The last figures in the <MONEY>$2.6 billion</MONEY> census won't be released
until <DATE>1993</DATE>.
   All regions had more people in <DATE>1990</DATE> compared with 10 years
earlier. The <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Mountain</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>South Atlantic</LOCATION> regions had the
sharpest growth, and the <ORGANIZATION>East North Central</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>West North Central</LOCATION> and
<ORGANIZATION>East South Central</ORGANIZATION> regions had the slowest.
   The Pacific states were the fastest growing region, <PERCENT>23.4
percent</PERCENT>, followed by the Mountain states, <PERCENT>20.6 percent</PERCENT>, and the
<LOCATION>South Atlantic</LOCATION> states, <PERCENT>18.8 percent</PERCENT>. In the <DATE>1970s</DATE> those regions had
each showed double-digit growth.
   By contrast, the <ORGANIZATION>East North Central</ORGANIZATION> states grew a bare <PERCENT>1.1
percent</PERCENT>; the <LOCATION>West North Central</LOCATION> states, <PERCENT>3.1 percent</PERCENT>; and the <LOCATION>East
South Central</LOCATION> states, <PERCENT>3.9 percent</PERCENT>. Those numbers represented a
falloff from each region's growth in the <DATE>1970s</DATE>.
   Other facts from the census release:
   -<LOCATION>Besides California</LOCATION>, states gaining representatives will be
<LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, four; <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, three; and <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, one seat each.
   -States losing representatives will be <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, three;
<LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>, two each; and <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION>, one each.
   -The <DATE>1990</DATE> census counted 922,819 members of the armed forces,
civilian employees of the federal government and their dependents
living abroad. Other Americans living overseas weren't counted.

<DATELINE> WASHINGTON (AP)  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> has supplanted <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> as the fourth most-populous state, ranking behind <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> said. 

   The <ORGANIZATION>Commerce Department</ORGANIZATION> bureau put the overall estimated <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> population as of <DATE>July 1</DATE> at 243.4 million people, up from nearly 241.1 million in mid-1986 and 226.5 million in the <DATE>1980</DATE> census. 

   The latest estimates showed that <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>'s population has grown by 2.3 million people, or <PERCENT>23%</PERCENT>, since <DATE>1980</DATE> when it ranked seventh. 

   <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> now ranks fifth, followed in order by <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> said. 

   Meanwhile, <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION>, the least-populous state at the time of the <DATE>1980</DATE> census, is now second-smallest with an estimated population of 525,000. 
Wyoming ranks last with a population of 490,000. 

   Population losses continued in the past year in five farm states -- <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>North Dakota</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION>. 

   Energy-depressed states, including <LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION>, also showed losses, and <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> grew far more slowly than earlier in the decade, the agency said. 

   The new figures are only estimates. 
The government will conduct a fullfledged census in <DATE>1990</DATE>.

<LEADPARA>  New York City grew by nearly 4 percent in the 1980s while other large cities

Thursday.;    On the second day of a three-day roll-out of population counts

<TEXT>     These are the final numbers of the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION>'s national count.;    In
addition to releasing the numbers for <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> and many other cities, the

mayor, <PERSON>David Dinkins</PERSON>, first complimented the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION>'s work, then
reiterated the criticism he has leveled at the agency throughout the <DATE>1990</DATE>
count.;    "After much prodding, we are pleased that the bureau no longer is

which actually is growing," said <PERSON>Dinkins</PERSON>. "But even today's bureau report
falls short -- far short -- of the number of people who live in <LOCATION>New York

dropped <PERCENT>6 percent</PERCENT> to 1,585,577, and <LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION> plummeted <PERCENT>15 percent</PERCENT> to
1,027,974.;    <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>'s population, released <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, was 2,783,726, down
7.4 percent.;    Several other cities in the <LOCATION>East</LOCATION> also were big losers.;   
The biggest drop was <LOCATION>Newark</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>, which fell more than <PERCENT>16 percent</PERCENT> to 275,221
people. <LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION>, named <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s most livable city in the mid-1980s, lost
nearly <PERCENT>13 percent</PERCENT> of its population, to 369,879. Cleveland slipped nearly <PERCENT>12
percent</PERCENT> to 505,616.;    Several small cities made big percentage gains --
<LOCATION>Boise</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION>, grew <PERCENT>23 percent</PERCENT>, to 125,738. Salem, <LOCATION>Ore.</LOCATION>, picked up <PERCENT>19 percent</PERCENT>
to 107,786, and <LOCATION>Huntsville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ala.</LOCATION>, gained nearly <PERCENT>12 percent</PERCENT> to 159,789.;    <ORGANIZATION>The

many of the poor weren't counted. They've sued in an attempt to force the
bureau to correct its numbers. The bureau will decide by midsummer whether to

   Two centuries after the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> was
founded as a largely agricultural nation, nearly nine-tenths of the
population growth is occurring in metropolitan areas, the <ORGANIZATION>Census
Bureau</ORGANIZATION> reports.
   Almost half of all Americans reside in just 37 major urban
areas, the bureau said <DATE>Thursday</DATE> in a new analysis of the patterns
of growth. And the metropolitan share of the population is growing
faster than that in rural areas.
   The ``rural renaissance'' reported in the <DATE>1970s</DATE> when small towns
and rural areas were growing seems to have ended, with increases in
cities and suburbs now well in the lead.
   The census study found that about <PERCENT>86 percent</PERCENT> of the nation's
population growth since <DATE>1980</DATE> has occurred in the 282 officially
designated metropolitan areas across the country. That pattern
represents a return to the metropolitan area dominance that has
been common since the era of the <ORGANIZATION>Great Depression</ORGANIZATION>, the bureau
reported.
   The analysis of <DATE>1987</DATE> figures found that nearly half of all
Americans, <PERCENT>48.9 percent</PERCENT>, reside in the 37 metro areas with
populations of a million or more.
   Led by <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, these metro areas had 119
million residents in <DATE>1987</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>Bureau</ORGANIZATION> said.
   <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> leads the way as the only state entirely included
within metropolitan areas, the bureau noted. The northern portion
of the state is included in the greater <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> metro area while
the southern portion is part of the <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> region.
   Seven other states have more than <PERCENT>90 percent</PERCENT> of their
populations in metropolitan areas _ <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Maryland</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Rhode Island</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>.
   Idaho is the least metropolitan state with only about <PERCENT>20 percent</PERCENT>
of its residents in urban areas, the report added.
   Reflecting the nation's overall population trend, metropolitan
area growth has tended to flow to the South and <LOCATION>West</LOCATION> in recent
years, the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> observed in its study of growth patterns
between <DATE>1980</DATE> and <DATE>1987</DATE>.
   The population loss experienced in the <LOCATION>Northeast</LOCATION> during the
<DATE>1970s</DATE> has halted in this decade, the agency found, while the
<LOCATION>Midwest</LOCATION> has continued to have net losses in recent years.
   ``A slowdown in population growth has taken place since <DATE>1980</DATE> in
much of the interior of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, especially in
nonmetropolitan areas,'' noted the report prepared by <PERSON>Donald E.
Starsinic</PERSON> and <PERSON>Richard L. Forstall</PERSON>.
   During this decade the nonmetropolitan population declined in 10
contiguous states _ <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>North Dakota</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>South Dakota</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION>, the
bureau pointed out.
   The nation's metro areas with 1 million or more residents, as of
<DATE>July 1, 1987</DATE>, were <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, 18.0 million; <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, 13.5
million; <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>, 8.1 million; <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, 5.9 million;
<LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION>, 5.9 million; <LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION>, 4.6 million; <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>, 4.1

   More Americans are once again calling the
Midwest their home, but Sunbelt states like <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>
remain the favored places to settle down, government figures show.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Thursday</DATE> released its <DATE>1988</DATE> population
estimates, showing that the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION> and parts of the South continued
strong population growth, while smaller growth rates were reflected
in the <LOCATION>Northeast</LOCATION>.
   The Midwest appeared to be rebounding after a dropoff in
population during the early part of the decade.
   The total <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> population stood at 245.8 million as of <DATE>July 1</DATE>,
the date of the <DATE>1988</DATE> Census statistics, reflecting a <PERCENT>3 percent</PERCENT>
increase in population from <DATE>July 1, 1985</DATE>.
   Over the three-year period, the biggest growth rate and
population loss were seen in small population states: <LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION> was up
<PERCENT>12.8 percent</PERCENT>, topping the 1 million mark for the first time; and the
energy-producing state of <LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION> had a <PERCENT>7.6 percent</PERCENT> decline, a loss
of 39,000 people, leaving its population at 471,000.
   The 12 Midwestern states _ where the depressed farm economy
caused a population downturn between <DATE>1981</DATE> and <DATE>1983</DATE> _ had an overall
<PERCENT>1.2 percent</PERCENT> population increase in the 1985-88 period, the Census
estimates showed.
   Some Midwestern states continued to lose residents, but the
<LOCATION>Midwest</LOCATION> as a region picked up slightly.
   Losses were estimated in <DATE>1985-1988</DATE> for <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>North
Dakota</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> said in a statement,
but added, ``The <DATE>1988</DATE> data indicate that the declines may be

year.''
   The largest state, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, had the greatest increase in
population, 1.8 million people, or <PERCENT>6.9 percent</PERCENT>, boosting its total
to 28.2 million.
   Other states that showed strong growth rates over the three years
were: <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>, <PERCENT>9.6 percent</PERCENT>, bringing its total to 3.5 million
people; <LOCATION>New Hampshire</LOCATION>, <PERCENT>9.9 percent</PERCENT>, to 1.1 million residents;
<LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, <PERCENT>8.9 percent</PERCENT>, to 12.4 million people; <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION>, <PERCENT>7.1 percent</PERCENT>,
to 6.4 million; <LOCATION>Maryland</LOCATION>, <PERCENT>5.7 percent</PERCENT>, to 4.6 million; and <LOCATION>Delaware</LOCATION>,
<PERCENT>5.4 percent</PERCENT>, to 660,000 people.
   Eleven states and the <ORGANIZATION>District of Columbia</ORGANIZATION> lost population during
the three years: <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>North Dakota</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION>.
   In the regions outside the <LOCATION>Midwest</LOCATION>, the government found that
population increased by <PERCENT>1.5 percent</PERCENT> in the <ORGANIZATION>Northeast</ORGANIZATION>, including the
<LOCATION>New England</LOCATION> and Mid-Atlantic states; by <PERCENT>3.7 percent</PERCENT> in the <LOCATION>South</LOCATION>;
and by <PERCENT>5.5 percent</PERCENT> in the West, including the Mountain and <LOCATION>Pacific
Coast</LOCATION> states.
   <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Sunshine State</ORGANIZATION>, continued to attract residents, with
a population growth rate of <PERCENT>8.9 percent</PERCENT>. That boosted its population

   America's people, statistically speaking, are
a just shade older than they've ever been before, with the median
age in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> reaching a record 32.3 years, the <ORGANIZATION>Census
Bureau</ORGANIZATION> reported <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
   That means half of all the people living in the country were
older than 32.3 years, and half younger, as of last <DATE>July 1</DATE>. This is
up from the median age of 32.1 a year earlier.
   By states, in terms of the median age, <LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>North
Carolina</LOCATION> are in the middle while the oldest Americans are in
<LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> and the youngest in <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION>.
   The maturing of the massive Baby Boom generation, born in the
years following World War II, is raising the nation's median age,
census officials and other analysts have noted.
   This group forms the largest segment of the population and as it
ages the median age is pulled along, Census demographer <PERSON>Ed Byerly</PERSON>
said in a telephone interview.
   After years of climbing gradually as life spans increased, the
median age reached 30 for the first time in the <DATE>1950</DATE> census, when
it was 30.2 years.
   But then the full force of the Baby Boom began to occur and the
large number of children in the population pulled the median down
for two decades.
   In <DATE>1980</DATE>, the median edged back up to 30 again and has continued
climbing since then, as the <ORGANIZATION>Baby Boomers</ORGANIZATION> pursued careers and
education and postponed having families, creating what some
statisticians call a Baby Bust.
   In the last few years, total births have begun rising as aging
Baby Boomers began having children, but those numbers remain too
small to have a major impact on the national median, <PERSON>Byerly</PERSON> said.
   Retirement-haven <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> remains the state with the oldest
population, with a median age of 36.4 years, up from 36.3 years in
<DATE>1987</DATE>.
   Following <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, the highest median ages were reported for the
large industrial states in the <LOCATION>Northeast</LOCATION>, with <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> second at
34.5 years followed by <LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> at 34.4.
   Indeed, the <ORGANIZATION>Northeast</ORGANIZATION> has the highest median age of the four
regions at 33.9 years. Next is the <LOCATION>Midwest</LOCATION> at 32.3 _ same as the
national figure _ followed by the South, 32; and the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION>, 31.6.
   The state with the youngest residents remains <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION>, where half
of the population is under 25.7 years, and half over. A year
earlier, <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION>'s median age was 25.5.
   Next lowest is <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION>, with a median figure of 28.7 years.
   Two states, <LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION>, match the national
median age, while the populations of 20 states and the <ORGANIZATION>District of
Columbia</ORGANIZATION> are older than the nation as a whole. The remaining 28
states have median ages younger than that of the country.

   Census Bureau Adds 3.8 Million to Count
   But Critics Say Millions Remain Missing

   WASHINGTON -- The Census Bureau added 3.8 million more
people to its 1990 headcount, but critics continue to
complain that the bureau is missing millions more.
   The bureau said yesterday that its almost-final tally from
the 1990 census is 249,632,692 people, 10.2% more than the
1980 census found.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The addition of 3.8 million people to the preliminary
total released this <DATE>summer</DATE> reflects 2.9 million residents the
bureau missed the first time as well as the anticipated
922,819 military and other federal employees and dependents
overseas.
   Under the Constitution, the new headcount will result in a
shift of 19 seats in the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. House of Representatives</ORGANIZATION>.
   <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> is the big winner, adding seven seats to give
it 52 representatives, or nearly <PERCENT>12%</PERCENT> of all the seats in the
435-member <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> is the big loser. It will lose
three seats and end up with 31 seats after the <DATE>1992</DATE> election.
   The <DATE>1990</DATE> tally includes military and other federal workers
and dependents living overseas. The <DATE>1980</DATE> tally didn't.
Excluding those people, the resident population of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
grew by <PERCENT>9.8%</PERCENT> during the <DATE>1980s</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON>Barbara
Bryant</PERSON> said.
   The bureau may yet make additional adjustments to the
tally. Under terms of an out-of-court settlement of a lawsuit
brought by <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION> and others who argued that the
census disproportionately misses minorities, the <ORGANIZATION>Commerce
Department</ORGANIZATION> must decide by <DATE>July 15</DATE> whether to adjust the
tallies statistically to compensate for the undercount.
Commerce Undersecretary <PERSON>Michael Darby</PERSON> yesterday called the
<DATE>1990</DATE> census "full, fair and efficient."
   But congressional skepticism persists. "It's not a
question of whether we have counted everyone. The census
never does," said Rep. <PERSON>Thomas Sawyer</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>), chairman of
the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> census subcommittee. "The question is how close
they've come to the truth."
   <ORGANIZATION>New York State Attorney</ORGANIZATION> General <PERSON>Robert Abrams</PERSON>, among those
suing the bureau, was quick to complain that the <DATE>1990</DATE> census
still undercounted his state. "When large segments of our
residents are left out of the political process, democracy is
devalued for all of us," he said.
   Additions to the preliminary tally reflect, among other
things, recanvassing of a substantial number of housing units
by census enumerators. With aid from state and local
governments, the bureau also identified about 125,000 housing
units it had missed. It also turned up an extra 400,000
people from parole records, <PERSON>Mrs. Bryant</PERSON> said recently.
   <PERSON>Mr. Darby</PERSON> noted that the new tally is "surprisingly close"
to earlier projections that the census would find a
population of 250 million. But Rep. <PERSON>Sawyer</PERSON> noted that the
249.6 million total is still substantially shy of the
bureau's recent projections, based on demographic data, of
253.4 million.
   The <DATE>1990</DATE> census confirms trends identified in earlier
reports, such as the rapid growth of the western states. "The
West is the big population gainer," <PERSON>Mrs. Bryant</PERSON> said. In the
past decade, the population of the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION> has grown by <PERCENT>22%</PERCENT>,
while the South grew by <PERCENT>13.5%</PERCENT>, the Northeast by <PERCENT>3.4%</PERCENT>, and the
<LOCATION>Midwest</LOCATION> by <PERCENT>1.3%</PERCENT>.
   The reassignment of seats in the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> reflects these
trends, with the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION> and Sunbelt states gaining at the
expense of the big industrial states of the <LOCATION>Northeast</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Midwest</LOCATION>. In addition to <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, states adding seats
include <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, which gains four seats; <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, which gains
three seats; and <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION>
and <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, which each gain one seat.
   Besides <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, states losing seats include <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>, which each lose two seats;
and <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION>, which each lose one
seat.
   None of these shifts comes as a surprise, however. Earlier
bureau reports on the <DATE>1990</DATE> count pointed to all of them.
   The figures may provide new ammunition for the <ORGANIZATION>District of
Columbia</ORGANIZATION>'s perennially unsuccessful campaign for statehood.
Although the census found that the district lost population
during the <DATE>1980s</DATE>, it still is larger than either <LOCATION>Vermont</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION> or <LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION>. Yet the district hasn't any seats in the
<ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>, and its one representative in the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> can't vote.
   The bureau also noted yesterday that four states lost
population in the <DATE>1980s</DATE>. They are <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>North Dakota</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>West
Virginia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION>.

   The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> population stood at 249,632,692 as of
the <DATE>1990</DATE> census, the government said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> in a numerical
portrait of a nation growing far more rapidly in the Sun Belt than
in the industrial north and agricultural heartland.
   <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, the nation's largest state, added more than 6
million people in the decade, a <PERCENT>26.1 percent</PERCENT> increase to 29,839,250
people.
   Wyoming remained the smallest state, with 455,975 people, down
<PERCENT>2.9 percent</PERCENT> from <DATE>1980</DATE>.
   <LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION> was the biggest population gainer in percentage terms,
and <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION> each grew by more than one-third as
millions of Americans flocked to the sunshine.
   <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION> was the largest loser in percentage terms.
   In all, the population increased by <PERCENT>10.2 percent</PERCENT> from the
226,504,825 people counted in the <DATE>1980</DATE> census, below the <PERCENT>11.4
percent</PERCENT> population growth recorded from <DATE>1970 to 1980</DATE>, and the <PERCENT>13.4
percent</PERCENT> rate from <DATE>1960</DATE> to <DATE>1970</DATE>.
   The information was contained in the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION>'s first
release of ``final figures'' - really tentative final figures -
from the <DATE>1990</DATE> count. The information will be used for everything
from readjusting the size of each state's congressional delegation
to parcelling out federal aid.
   In political terms, the population shifts will give <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>
seven new <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> seats, and add lawmakers to seven other states.
Thirteen states will lose representation.
   Because of the importance of the population estimates, some
states and cities are likely to challenge the tallies, and a final
count isn't expected until next <DATE>summer</DATE>.
   The cost of the <DATE>1990</DATE> census, from planning begun in <DATE>1984</DATE> to a
final release of data in <DATE>1993</DATE>, is estimated at <MONEY>$2.6 billion</MONEY> by the
bureau.
   Still locked in <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> computers - to be doled out over
the next several years - is a wealth of information about age,
race, living conditions and other details of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> near the turn
of the century.
   Besides <LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION>, four other states lost population. The biggest
percentage loser was <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION>, whose population dropped by <PERCENT>7.6
percent</PERCENT> to 1,801,625. Other states losing population were <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>,
down <PERCENT>4.3 percent</PERCENT>, and and <LOCATION>North Dakota</LOCATION>, down <PERCENT>1.7 percent</PERCENT>. The
<ORGANIZATION>District of Columbia</ORGANIZATION> also lost population, <PERCENT>4.5 percent</PERCENT>.
   The sharpest gainer in percentage terms was <LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION>. That state's
population grew by <PERCENT>50.7 percent</PERCENT> to 1,206,152. Besides <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>,
other states with gains of more than <PERCENT>25 percent</PERCENT> were <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, up
<PERCENT>33.4 percent</PERCENT>; <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>, up <PERCENT>35.3 percent</PERCENT>; and <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION>, up <PERCENT>37.4
percent</PERCENT>.
   The Pacific states were the fastest growing region, <PERCENT>23.4
percent</PERCENT>, followed by the Mountain states, <PERCENT>20.6 percent</PERCENT>, and the
<LOCATION>South Atlantic</LOCATION> states, <PERCENT>18.8 percent</PERCENT>. By contrast, the <ORGANIZATION>East North
Central</ORGANIZATION> states grew a bare <PERCENT>1.1 percent</PERCENT>, and the <LOCATION>West North Central</LOCATION>
states, <PERCENT>3.1 percent</PERCENT>.
   Some regions went against the broader trend. <LOCATION>New England</LOCATION>, which
had a boom in high-tech industry during the <DATE>1980s</DATE>, grew by <PERCENT>7.2
percent</PERCENT>. The East South Central states grew only <PERCENT>3.9 percent</PERCENT>.
   Because of the high financial and political stakes, the census
numbers and the way they were obtained are certain to draw
continued sharp scrutiny.
   More than 6,000 local governments challenged the accuracy of a
preliminary count based mainly on the <DATE>April 1</DATE> census taken by mail.
The <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> responded with a series of recounts and an ad
campaign urging people who thought they had been missed to come
forward.
   The final national population total was nearly 4 million people
more than the preliminary number released by the bureau earlier
this year.
   <ORGANIZATION>Commerce</ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON>Robert Mosbacher</PERSON> has until <DATE>July 1991</DATE>, to
decide whether to adjust the census numbers to account for a
statistically determined undercount of minorities. An adjustment
would increase political representation of areas with a high
percentage of minorities, and lower that of other areas.
   <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> will gain seven seats, giving it 52 in the 435-member
<ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> will gain four; <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, three; and <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, one seat each.
   <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> will lose three seats; <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>, two seats each; and <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION>,
one seat each.
   The <DATE>1990</DATE> census for the first time counted some Americans living
abroad. The total included 922,819 members of the armed forces,
civilian employees of the federal government and their dependents.
   The comparable numbers from 10 years earlier counted only people
living within the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>.
   The Census Bureau on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> released two sets of <DATE>1980</DATE>
numbers. The 226,504,825 figure used by the bureau for comparison
with the <DATE>1990</DATE> national total was released in <DATE>December 1980</DATE> but was
later adjusted slightly to get rid of minor problems. The adjusted
figure was 226,545,805.
   The <DATE>1990</DATE> population count was nearly 64 times the 3,929,214
counted in <DATE>1790</DATE>, the first census in the nation's history. By <DATE>1900</DATE>,
the population had reached 76,212,168.
   In <DATE>1950</DATE>, the first census after World War II, the population was
151,325,798.
   In <DATE>January</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> will begin sending information on
small areas, in some cases the size of a city block, to state
legislatures so they can begin drawing new congressional and
legislative boundaries.
   That process will be completed by <DATE>April 1</DATE>.
   The bureau will put off releasing detailed demographic data
until after the decision on adjusting the figures.

<HL> REGIONS:
Alaska Learns What It's Like
To Register a Population Loss

<TEXT>
   ADD <LOCATION>ALASKA</LOCATION> to the short list of states losing population. 
The reason: a sharp increase in the number of residents moving out. 
In the early <DATE>1980s</DATE>, a healthy influx of newcomers, plus the highest natural population increase of any state (about six babies are born in <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION> for every person that dies), kept population moving up briskly. 
Between <DATE>1980</DATE> and <DATE>1986</DATE>, <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION>'s population rose <PERCENT>32%</PERCENT>, by far the fastest rate of increase of any state. 

   But as the state's oil-based economy softened, the traditional migration pattern reversed. 
<PERSON>Gregory Williams</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION>'s state demographer, estimates that in the 12 months ended in <DATE>July 1987</DATE>, up to 15,000 more people left <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION> than moved into the state. 
That was more than enough to offset the natural population increase of about 10,000 for the same period. 

   With <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION>'s unemployment rate close to <PERCENT>10%</PERCENT>, a lot of out-migrants have headed for <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Pacific Northwest</LOCATION>, where the job market is healthier. 
There is a plus side to this outflow: Sluicing out excess workers should bring the local labor supply into better balance and help stanch the state's population loss. 
"We're seeing signs that this (population drain) has begun to bottom out," says <PERSON>Mr. Williams</PERSON>. 

   Ten states either lost population or had no population gain in the 12 months ended in <DATE>July 1986</DATE>, the most recent estimates published by the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION>. 
They are: <LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>North Dakota</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>South Dakota</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION>.

   <LOCATION>PHILLY</LOCATION> MEETS THE JOB SQUEEZE: <ORGANIZATION>First Pennsylvania Bank</ORGANIZATION>'s quarterly survey of executives in Philadelphia-area companies picks up some of the same labor shortage complaints that <LOCATION>New England</LOCATION> executives have been making the past couple of years. 

   Nearly <PERCENT>70%</PERCENT> of the metro <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> companies questioned said they planned to add employees next year, from managers to production workers, and all but a few said finding these workers would be tough. 
Higher pay doesn't seem to help much. 
The companies are already paying an average <MONEY>$6.58</MONEY> an hour for entry-level workers. 
Only <PERCENT>11%</PERCENT> said they had anyone on the payroll making the <MONEY>$3.35</MONEY> an hour minimum wage. 

   Despite the labor crunch, only <PERCENT>7%</PERCENT> of the companies said they'd consider moving operations to an area with more abundant labor.

   LITTLE PHNOM PENH: <LOCATION>Long Beach</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, is now reputed to have the largest concentration of ethnic Cambodians outside <LOCATION>Southeast Asia</LOCATION>. 
No one has yet done a full-fledged head count, but <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>'s education department says there are 3,325 "English impaired" students in <LOCATION>Long Beach</LOCATION> schools whose first language is Khmer (the Cambodian national language), double the number of the next-highest school district. 

   Add to this figure Cambodian students fluent in English, factor in parents, toddlers and in-laws at home, plus other adults, and the Cambodian population in <LOCATION>Long Beach</LOCATION> could fall in the 25,000 to 40,000 range.

   NORTH DAKOTANS TRADITIONALLY VOTE in large numbers, but in the <DATE>November 1986</DATE> congressional elections, they beat every state in both registration (an amazing <PERCENT>95%</PERCENT> of the voting age population) and turnout at the polls (<PERCENT>73%</PERCENT>). 
A fiercely contested <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Senate</ORGANIZATION> race, in which Democrat Kent Conrad nosed out Republican incumbent <PERSON>Mark Andrews</PERSON>, helped fire the voters enthusiasm. 

   <LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Oregon</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>South Dakota</LOCATION> all had turnouts of more than <PERCENT>60%</PERCENT> of the voting-age populace in <DATE>1986</DATE>, according to a new voting behavior analysis from the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION>. 
The worst performer: <LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION>, where only one-third of potentially eligible voters cast ballots.

   <LOCATION>ARIZONA</LOCATION> PURCHASING MANAGERS see signs of prosperity mixed with looming inflation. 
Average delivery time on incoming shipments is now the longest since mid-1984. 
Inventory levels continue to grow, and new orders in <DATE>August</DATE> and <DATE>September</DATE> were unusually strong. 
Meanwhile, price increases in the last two months were at the fastest rate in more than three years. 
The indicators are from the <ORGANIZATION>Purchasing Management Association of Arizona</ORGANIZATION>'s <DATE>September</DATE> survey.

   EMPLOYEE TRANSFERS to high-cost areas aren't going down well, says relocation consultant <ORGANIZATION>Runzheimer International</ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION>Rochester</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wis</LOCATION>. 
Three-fourths of 143 corporate relocation administrators questioned said employees reassigned to the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> metropolitan area either resisted the move or refused to go. 
Other areas where <ORGANIZATION>Runzheimer</ORGANIZATION> says above-average cost-of-living is a significant barrier to relocation: <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>.

   Racial Groups Diverge
   In Timing of First Births
                                                                                                       

</LP>
<TEXT>
   RACIAL differences in the timing of first births are
widening, two <ORGANIZATION>University of Pennsylvania</ORGANIZATION> demographers find.
   Drawing on birth and other records published since <DATE>1979</DATE>,
<PERSON>Renbao Chen</PERSON> and <PERSON>S. Philip Morgan</PERSON> determine that from <DATE>1980</DATE> to
<DATE>1987</DATE> white women under 30 years old continued an earlier
trend toward postponing their first birth, while white women
over 30 began showing slightly higher rates of first births
than over-30 women of earlier decades, clearly seeking to
catch up on postponed fertility. Nonwhite women -- blacks,
Asians and others -- also tended to have their first children
at somewhat later ages than nonwhite women in earlier years.
   But at every age from the teens on, blacks and other
nonwhites were far more likely to be having their first birth
than were white women of the same age. For example, in <DATE>1987</DATE> a
20-year-old nonwhite woman was almost twice as likely to have
her first child in the following year as was a 20-year-old
white woman, while a 25-year-old nonwhite woman was about 1
1/2 times more likely to be having her first child than her
white counterpart.
   The research also showed that nonwhite women now have far
lower rates of childlessness than white women. Historically,
blacks had far higher rates, due largely to health and other
involuntary factors. This situation started reversing in the
<DATE>1950s</DATE>, and the difference has grown greater as more white
women have forgone having children altogether. In <DATE>1987</DATE>, for
instance, a white woman born in <DATE>1954</DATE> was better than three
times more likely to be childless than a 33-year-old
nonwhite.
                                                                                                       

   Farm Belt Holds Onto
   Its Oldest Americans
                                                                                                       

   THE OLDEST old, those 85 or more, bulk largest in the Farm
Belt, <DATE>1990</DATE> census figures show.
   Not surprisingly, the largest numbers of 85-plus men and
women are found in the most populous states: <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>. In each of these, people 85 and over total well
into six figures.
   Looked at as a percentage of a state's population,
however, a much different picture emerges. In 14 states, the
85-and-older group accounts for <PERCENT>1.5%</PERCENT> or more of the total
population. Iowa leads with <PERCENT>2.0%</PERCENT>, closely followed by <LOCATION>South
Dakota</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION> with <PERCENT>1.9%</PERCENT>, <LOCATION>North Dakota</LOCATION> with <PERCENT>1.8%</PERCENT> and
<LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION> with <PERCENT>1.7%</PERCENT>.
   In nine other states, including <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Wisconsin</LOCATION>, the oldest old account for
<PERCENT>1.6%</PERCENT> or <PERCENT>1.5%</PERCENT> of the total. The other states in this category
are <LOCATION>East Coast</LOCATION>: <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Rhode Island</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION>. <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION>, by contrast, is at the bottom of the ranking,
with only <PERCENT>0.2%</PERCENT> of its population 85 or older.
   Much the same states rank at or near the top in the
percentage of total state population living in nursing homes.
The <LOCATION>Dakotas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Wisconsin</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Rhode Island</LOCATION> are the only states with
at least <PERCENT>1%</PERCENT> of their populations living in nursing homes.
Census Bureau specialist <PERSON>Cynthia Taeuber</PERSON> says most nursing
home residents are 85 or older.
   So why do the oldest old figure so heavily in these
states? <PERSON>Ms. Taeuber</PERSON> hypothesizes that in most of these states
younger adults move out to seek better job opportunities,
while the older natives stay and age in place, inevitably
constituting a larger share of the total. And with their
children moved away, many end up in nursing homes.
   Another census report says that the number of
centenarians, men and women 100 or older, more than doubled
between <DATE>1980</DATE> and <DATE>1990</DATE>, increasing to 35,808 from an estimated
14,000 to 16,000. (There was no precise count in <DATE>1980</DATE>.) More
than 28,000 of the 35,808 were women, and well over 29,000 of
the total were white.
                                                                                                       

   Golf Has More Players,
   Who Play More Often
                                                                                                       

   MORE PEOPLE are playing golf, and most are playing more
often, a recreation specialist reports.
   <PERSON>Rod Warnick</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>University of Massachusetts</ORGANIZATION> professor who
tracks leisure trends, calculates that the number of adult
golfers increased about <PERCENT>6%</PERCENT> a year in the <DATE>1980s</DATE> to 22.2
million, while the number of days played grew about <PERCENT>7%</PERCENT>
annually to 393.7 million. Moreover, he notes, the number of
"heavy" golfers, those playing 20 or more times a year, grew
even faster, more than doubling to 6.8 million, while the
number of days these avid golfers played increased about <PERCENT>8%</PERCENT>
annually to almost 300 million days.
   <PERSON>Mr. Warnick</PERSON> says the growth of leisure time, the
increasing numbers of retirees and the aging of the baby
boomers all contributed. He also finds that more women and
minorities have taken up the game -- a trend he sees as apt
to lead to further anti-discrimination suits against golf
clubs and courses that aren't fully integrated or given to
equal treatment.
                                                                                                       

   Odds and Ends
                                                                                                       

   MOBILE HOMES make up <PERCENT>7%</PERCENT> of the nation's housing inventory,
the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> reports. This is the fastest-growing type
of housing, up <PERCENT>60%</PERCENT> since <DATE>1980</DATE>. . . . Athletes who play hard
to win are more apt to get hurt than those who just play for
fun, <ORGANIZATION>University of Florida</ORGANIZATION> researchers find. They say those
who take a game too much to heart are more likely to put
themselves in a risky situation in an effort to come out
ahead. . . . Diseases and other causes of disability in women
65 and older will be the subject of a seven-year study by the
<ORGANIZATION>Johns Hopkins School of Medicine</ORGANIZATION> under a contract with the
government's <ORGANIZATION>National Institute on Aging</ORGANIZATION>. About two-thirds of
all disabled older people are female.

<HEAD>Census Figures for Eighteen States Issued</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At least four states may have lost population
since <DATE>1980</DATE>, according to preliminary Census figures.
   <LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>North Dakota</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION> registered
population declines, data released <DATE>Friday</DATE> showed.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> said 14 other states reported increases.
   Reports for the 18 states were sent to state and local officials
as part of the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION>'s local review program.
   Census officials emphasized that the figures are preliminary and
were provided to allow local governments to question the results in
the event people were missed or overcounted.
   Final official state population figures are scheduled to be
issued <DATE>Dec. 31</DATE>.
   Here is a list of the figures made public <DATE>Friday</DATE>, compared with
the results of the <DATE>1980</DATE> census. Reports for other states are
expected to become public over the next few weeks.
   Connecticut: 3,226,929, up from 3,108,000.
   Delaware: 658,031, up from 594,000.
   Idaho: 1,003,558, up from 944,000.
   Kentucky: 3,665,220, up from 3,661,000.
   <LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION>: 4,180,831, down from 4,206,000.

      Census Bureau Sees
   Slow <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Growth Ahead
   ACCORDING TO projections published today by the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION>, there will be nearly 250 million people in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> by <DATE>1990</DATE>, up 23.3 million from <DATE>1980</DATE>. 
If the <DATE>1990</DATE> census proves these figures correct, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> population will have grown by only <PERCENT>10.3%</PERCENT> this decade, the lowest rate in <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> history except for the Depression years of the <DATE>1930s</DATE>, when it was <PERCENT>7.2%</PERCENT>. 
The projections also indicate record low growth in the near future: <PERCENT>7.2%</PERCENT> in the <DATE>1990s</DATE> and <PERCENT>5.3%</PERCENT> between <DATE>2000</DATE> and <DATE>2010</DATE>. 

   But the bureau foresees wide variation from state to state. 
For example, it expects that during the <DATE>1980s</DATE>, four states (<LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>) will together have lost nearly 300,000 people. 
At the other extreme, the four fastest-growing states (<LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION>) are expected each to have grown more than <PERCENT>30%</PERCENT>, adding a total of 4.6 million people. 

   Fastest growth doesn't mean most growth, however. 
About half of total <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> growth for the rest of the century will occur in just three states -- <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> -- which are expected to gain 12 million people in the <DATE>1980s</DATE> and 9.5 million in the <DATE>1990s</DATE>.

   Interstate Migration
   Plays a Key Role
   THE CENSUS <ORGANIZATION>Bureau</ORGANIZATION>'s projections assume that past trends in birth, death and migration rates will continue. Natural increase (births minus deaths) varies little from state to state, so interstate migration is often the key in determining future populations. For example, <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> is projected to gain 435,000 people from natural increase during the <DATE>1990s</DATE> -- but lose 498,000 to out-migration.
   While all 50 states are expected to show positive natural increase this decade, 24 will see that growth partially or completely offset by people leaving. Positive natural increase is seen for most states during the next decade as well, but <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> could be an unusual case. It is projected to have 20,000 more deaths than births between <DATE>1990</DATE> and <DATE>2000</DATE>. A net in-migration of 2.6 million, though, will overwhelm this negative natural increase.
   Many factors can influence migration, perhaps even government intervention. <LOCATION>New York state</LOCATION>, which lost population in the <DATE>1970s</DATE>, has lowered personal income tax rates and some business taxes. Coincidentally or not, it is expected to gain 215,000 people this decade.
   Workers Seen Carrying
   Fewer Dependents
   PROMISING A lighter burden of support, the overall dependency ratio in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> is expected to decline to 57 by <DATE>2010</DATE> from 62 in <DATE>1987</DATE>. The ratio measures the number of dependents (children under 18 and people 65 and older) for every 100 nondependents (those 18 to 64).
   The number of nondependents will rise <PERCENT>17%</PERCENT> between <DATE>1990</DATE> and <DATE>2010</DATE>, while that of dependents will grow only <PERCENT>7%</PERCENT>, according to the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION>'s forecast. However, these figures mask differences between the young and the elderly, as well as among geographic regions.
   The number of people 65 and older is projected to grow <PERCENT>25%</PERCENT> between <DATE>1990</DATE> and <DATE>2010</DATE>, raising the elderly dependency ratio to 21.9 from 20.5. The ratio for those under 18 will drop to 34.8 from 41.5, as fewer children are born.
   The dependency ratio is based strictly on age groups and makes no assumptions about true dependence. In fact, more than <PERCENT>10%</PERCENT> of the elderly were employed in <DATE>1987</DATE>, and only <PERCENT>72%</PERCENT> of working-age people were actually working.
   Study Profiles Network
   Of Family Support
   MORE THAN FOUR million Americans provide financial support to seven million young children living outside their households, according to another new Census Bureau report; two million provide support to three million adults outside their homes, mostly elderly parents. Of these providers, <PERCENT>6%</PERCENT> are helping both children and adults who don't live with them. The bureau estimates that payments total <MONEY>$19 billion</MONEY> a year.
   The typical provider is a divorced father 25 to 44 years old. On average, providers have an annual family income of <MONEY>$37,800</MONEY> and pay <MONEY>$3,000</MONEY> a year in support; those supporting both kids and adults average <MONEY>$43,500</MONEY> in income and <MONEY>$8,400</MONEY> in support annually. The largest amount of support -- an average of <MONEY>$7,800</MONEY> -- goes to spouses who are separated or temporarily living apart. Ex-spouses get the next-largest chunk, averaging <MONEY>$4,700</MONEY> each. Children 21 and older receive an average of <MONEY>$3,800</MONEY> a year; those under 21 get <MONEY>$1,600</MONEY> on average. Parents receiving support get an average of <MONEY>$1,500</MONEY>.

<HEAD>Population Gains to Give Sunbelt States More Seats in Congress</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Inserts new 6th graf with 1980 population</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The flow of Americans to <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> has pushed
the <ORGANIZATION>Golden State</ORGANIZATION> far ahead of all rivals in population and will
give it a record 52 seats in the <DATE>1992</DATE> House of Representatives, new
census figures indicate.
   Preliminary <DATE>1990</DATE> population figures show <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> picking up
seven <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> seats, followed by <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> with four, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> three and a
handful of other warm-weather states with one each.
   <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> hung on to its No. 2 ranking in population behind
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION> in the new figures _ with <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> closing fast
in third and fourth places _ but will lose three seats in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>
because its population rose only slightly in the <DATE>1980s</DATE>.
   Four Northern industrial states _ <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> _ lost population during the decade and will have two
fewer seats each.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> estimated a national count of just under 246
million, including 29.3 million in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, 17.6 million in <LOCATION>New
York</LOCATION>, 16.8 million in <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> and 12.8 million in <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>. Wyoming
was last, at just under 450,000, passed by <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION>, which had the
smallest population in <DATE>1980</DATE> but grew to almost 546,000 in <DATE>1990</DATE>.
   The total population count in <DATE>1980</DATE> was 226,545,805.
   House seats are redistributed among the states after each
Census. Because the number is limited to 435 seats, when a growing
state gains a seat some other state must lose one.
   <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>'s slight population gain was quickly disputed by state
officials, who had predicted repeatedly that the state would be
undercounted.
   ``I don't believe it,'' Gov. <PERSON>Mario Cuomo</PERSON> said in <LOCATION>Albany</LOCATION>. ``Do
you really, honestly believe that everybody who should be counted
has been counted? The answer is of course not. My mother had
trouble; she didn't want to answer.''
   <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON>David N. Dinkins</PERSON> called the city's estimated
slight decline ``unadulterated nonsense'' and promised to pinpoint
where he said the government had made errors.
   Overall 19 <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> seats will change states according to the
figures, which could change significantly before the final report
is issued <DATE>Dec. 31</DATE>.
   The widely noted movement of Americans to the Sun Belt was
documented anew in the Census Bureau figures. Besides <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, states gaining a <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> seat each were <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>.
   Besides the two-seat losers _ <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> _ there will be one less seat each for <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>West
Virginia</LOCATION>.
   Overall, the preliminary Census figures show the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>
with a population of 245,837,683 residents. That's somewhat below
the 250 million that the bureau had estimated earlier this year.
   However, 4 million or more may be added as the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION>
conducts follow up counts and completes tabulations before the
final reports are made public. If those are added in only a few
states, some of the seats allocated in the preliminary tally could
shift again.
   For example, a study by the private firm <ORGANIZATION>Election Data Services</ORGANIZATION>
showed <LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION> neck and neck for the last seat
allocated. <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION> got the seat, but a shift of 3,000 people
could shift it to <LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Kimball Brace</PERSON>, head of EDS, stressed that the figures are
subject to change.
   In addition to changes made after local officials assess the
preliminary figures, there is a chance that the final report could
be adjusted next <DATE>summer</DATE>.
   The bureau has been criticized for undercounting minorities in
the past and is conducting a post-census check on its count this
time. If officials determine that some group has been missed a
decision could be made to statistically adjust the final numbers.
   That ruling will be made by the <ORGANIZATION>Department of Commerce</ORGANIZATION> in
<DATE>mid-July 1991</DATE>.
   The national total was completed <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> with the reports for
the final four states _ <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>.
   Census officials emphasize that the figures are provided to
allow local governments to question the results in the event people
were missed or overcounted.

<HEAD>New Census Figures Could Affect Reapportionment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Census Bureau figures released today indicate
that seven states are likely to gain seats in the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. House of
Representatives</ORGANIZATION> in reapportionment, while as many as a dozen states
will lose at least one seat, forecasters say.
   The next reapportionment will be based on the final <DATE>1990</DATE> Census
figures, which will be collected in the 10-year census next year.
The state population figures released <DATE>today</DATE> go up to mid-1989 and
represent one last checkpoint before the final, official count.
   The non-profit <ORGANIZATION>Population Reference Bureau</ORGANIZATION> said that if the
trends in this latest report hold true through the final <DATE>1990</DATE>
figures, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> will gain seven seats, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> each
will gain three, and <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>
will gain one apiece.
   At the same time, 11 states are likely to lose one or more
seats, the <ORGANIZATION>Population Reference Bureau</ORGANIZATION> said. It said <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> will
lose three seats, <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION> each
will lose two, and <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>West
Virginia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> each will lose one.
   Comparable predictions by <ORGANIZATION>Election Data Services Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a
Washington-based political consulting firm, differed little. The
firm, however, added <LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION> to the list of losers, dropping one
congressional seat, and predicted that <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> will gain four
seats, rather than three.
   However, the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> figures on which the predictions are
based do not include members of the military and their dependents
living overseas. They will be counted in the <DATE>1990</DATE> reapportionment,
the government recently announced, and that change could mean the
difference in whether some states gain or lose a seat.
   The Census figures show that the populations of five states grew
at rates faster than <PERCENT>10 percent</PERCENT> <DATE>from 1985</DATE> to mid-1989.
   The state that experienced the largest percentage increase in
population between <DATE>1985</DATE> and mid-1989, <LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION>, grew by <PERCENT>18 percent</PERCENT>.
Second was <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>, <PERCENT>12 percent</PERCENT>, followed by <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New
Hampshire</LOCATION> at <PERCENT>11 percent</PERCENT> and <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> at <PERCENT>10 percent</PERCENT>.
   At the same time, seven states lost population, the bureau said:
<LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>North Dakota</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
   <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> eclipsed <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION> to become the nation's fifth-most-populous state during the year ended <DATE>July 1</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> estimated. 

   <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>'s steady population gains have moved it from 10th place since <DATE>1960</DATE>. 
Texas is the only other state among the 10 biggest to move up significantly in the past 26 years; it rose to third from sixth place in <DATE>1960</DATE>, the census agency said. 
But three states -- <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION> -- have added residents at a faster clip than <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> since <DATE>1980</DATE>. 

   In 10 Farm and Energy Belt states, population losses occurred for the first time during the <DATE>1980s</DATE> or persisted from <DATE>1985</DATE> to <DATE>1986</DATE>. 
They are: <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>North Dakota</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>South Dakota</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION>. 

   The industrial Midwestern states, however, experienced increases in population from <DATE>1985 to 1986</DATE> as their economies continued rebounding, according to the report.

   Much of the GI generation that fought in World

retiring in relative comfort, a <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> researcher reports.
   More than half of retirees age 65 to 74 have income at double
the poverty level, and <PERCENT>12 percent</PERCENT> form an elite with income from at
least three sources, according to <PERSON>Charles F. Longino</PERSON> of the
<ORGANIZATION>University of Miami</ORGANIZATION>.
   But elderly affluence isn't spread evenly across the nation,
<PERSON>Longino</PERSON> reports in the <DATE>June</DATE> edition of American Demographics
magazine.
   ``There are a cluster of states with a large share of the
comfortably retired,'' <PERSON>Longino</PERSON> said in analyzing <DATE>1980</DATE> Census data,
the most recent information available with sufficient detail for
the study.
   <LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> had many of
the comfortably retired, while the pension elite made strong
showings in <LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Longino</PERSON> found.
   The poverty level for a family of four was <MONEY>$8,414</MONEY> in <DATE>1980</DATE>.
   The World War II GIs reaped the benefits of government programs
that provided educations and home loans, cost-of-living escalators
for their Social Security benefits and federal laws protecting
private pensions, <PERSON>Longino</PERSON> noted. In addition, many were able to
invest in stocks and bonds in a time of booming economy.
   Longino looked at three groups of retirees in his study, those
aged 55 to 64, 65-74 and 75 and over in <DATE>1980</DATE>. He termed them the GI
generation after the term ``Government Issue,'' which became a
popular for soldiers in the <DATE>1940s</DATE>.
   Just over half (<PERCENT>51.1 percent</PERCENT>) of those in the 65-74 age group
were listed as comfortable, and <PERCENT>12.3 percent</PERCENT> were in the elite

   For the younger group, <PERCENT>59.1 percent</PERCENT> were comfortable and <PERCENT>4.7
percent</PERCENT> were in the elite. They were less likely to qualify as
elite since few were receiving Social Security in addition to other
retirement benefits.
   The oldest group listed <PERCENT>37.5 percent</PERCENT> as comfortable and <PERCENT>8.5
percent</PERCENT> as elite. Few in this group had income-generating assets
and most completed a large share of their working lives before
World War II, when pension benefits were less common and lower.
   Longino found the confortably retired of the 65-74 age group in
such resort and retirement states as <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New
Jersey</LOCATION>; in <LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION>, where many <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> executives have
retired, and <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>.
   <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION> has a large Asian population where extended families are
more common, a situation which boosts the household income measure
used as the basis for this calculation, <PERSON>Longino</PERSON> noted.
   For the pension elite, <LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> placed well,
as did <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Maryland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION>. Longino also noted that there
are clusters of affluent elderly in some metropolitan areas.

   Here is a state-by-state rundown of the percentage of Americans
aged 65-74 who are considered confortably retired, or among the
pension elite.
   Comfortably retired (CR) is defined as having income of twice
the poverty level. Pension elite (PE) means receiving from three
sources: Social Security, pensions and assets.

aged 65-74 who are considered confortably retired, or among the
pension elite.
   Comfortably retired (CR) is defined as having income of twice
the poverty level. Pension elite (PE) means receiving from three
sources: Social Security, pensions and assets.

   The industrial states of the <LOCATION>Midwest</LOCATION> and
<ORGANIZATION>Northeast</ORGANIZATION> are pulling out of the population doldrums and adding
people once again, the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> reported <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   ``The industrial-based states of <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>
continue to recover from the early <DATE>1980s</DATE> population losses,'' the
bureau said. ``These three states added more population between <DATE>1986</DATE>
and <DATE>1988</DATE> than in the previous five years combined.''
   In addition, the <ORGANIZATION>Northeast</ORGANIZATION>'s population growth between <DATE>1985</DATE> and
<DATE>1988</DATE> was the highest since the <DATE>late 1960s</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>Bureau</ORGANIZATION> said.
   And the report came just one day after the bureau and the
<ORGANIZATION>Department of Agriculture</ORGANIZATION> reported that the nation's rural
population had halted its long-term decline.
   Growth was sluggish in states with energy-based economies, the
bureau added, particularly <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>West
Virginia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION>.
   But the other trends notwithstanding, the bureau noted that the
nation's overall growth pattern continues to favor Sun Belt states
like <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>.
   At least since <DATE>1970</DATE>, the <LOCATION>Western</LOCATION> region has remained the fastest
growing section of the nation, with the South second, the bureau
noted in the study ``State Population and Household Estimates, With
Age, Sex and Components of Change: 1981-88.''
   ``The East North Central states increased by 443,000 from <DATE>1985</DATE> to
<DATE>1988</DATE> after population losses during the 1980-85 period,'' the report
said. ``<LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> added more population in the
three-year period between <DATE>1986</DATE> and <DATE>1988</DATE> than in the previous
six-year period.''
   The Northeast lost population between <DATE>1975</DATE> and <DATE>1980</DATE> but has since
recovered, the report said, and annual growth of <PERCENT>0.5 percent</PERCENT> between
<DATE>1985</DATE> and <DATE>1988</DATE> is the highest since <DATE>1970</DATE>. Indeed, half of <LOCATION>New
England</LOCATION>'s growth between <DATE>1980</DATE> and <DATE>1988</DATE> has occurred just since <DATE>1985</DATE>.
   Slowed growth and population losses have plagued several
farm-oriented states in recent years. But, the bureau concluded,
``the downward slide seems to have reversed last year.'' <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION> showed
a slight new immigration, as did <LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>South Dakota</LOCATION> has
slowed its outmigration enough to experience population growth for
two consecutive years.
   The sluggish population growth in energy-dependent states is a
continuing problem, with <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION> losing people every year in
this decade and even <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, which added 59,000 people in the year
ending <DATE>July 30, 1988</DATE>, far below its peak growth of 1981-82, when it
agined 609,000.
   In fact, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> experienced net outmigration last year, for the
second year in a row, the report said.
   Here is a state-by-state list showing the population of the
states according to the <DATE>1980</DATE> census and the estimates for <DATE>1985</DATE> and
<DATE>1988</DATE>, in thousands.

   Population Drain Ends 

   For <LOCATION>Midwestern States 

   IOWA</LOCATION> IS MAKING a comeback. 
So are <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>. 
The population of all four states is on the upswing, according to new <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> estimates, following declines throughout the early <DATE>1980s</DATE>. 

   The gains, to be sure, are rather small. 
<LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>, for instance, saw its population grow by 11,000 people, or <PERCENT>0.4%</PERCENT>, between <DATE>1987</DATE> and <DATE>1988</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> says. 
Still, even that modest increase is good news for a state that hadn't grown at all since <DATE>1981</DATE>. 

   Between <DATE>1987</DATE> and <DATE>1988</DATE>, <LOCATION>North Dakota</LOCATION> was the only state in the <LOCATION>Midwest</LOCATION> to lose population, a loss of 4,000 people. 
Six of the 12 midwestern states have been growing steadily since <DATE>1980</DATE> -- <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>South Dakota</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Wisconsin</LOCATION>. 

   The <ORGANIZATION>Northeast</ORGANIZATION> has been holding its own in the population race. 
Seven of nine states have grown each year since <DATE>1980</DATE>, including <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, which lost <PERCENT>4%</PERCENT> of its population during the <DATE>1970s</DATE>. 
And although <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION> suffered slight declines earlier in the decade, they are growing again. 

   At the same time, several states in the <LOCATION>South and West</LOCATION> have had their own population turnaround. 
Seven states that grew in the early <DATE>1980s</DATE> are now losing population -- <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION>. 

   Overall, though, the South and West still outpace the <LOCATION>Northeast</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Midwest</LOCATION>, and fast-growing states like <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> ensure that the pattern will continue. 
But the growth gap between the Sun Belt and other regions has clearly started narrowing. 

   More Elderly Maintain 

   Their Independence 

   THANKS TO modern medicine, more couples are growing old together. 
And even after losing a spouse, more of the elderly are staying independent. 
A new <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> study of the noninstitutionalized population shows that <PERCENT>64%</PERCENT> of people aged 65 to 74 were living with a spouse in <DATE>1988</DATE>, up from <PERCENT>59%</PERCENT> in <DATE>1970</DATE>. 

   This doesn't mean they're less likely to live alone, however. 
That share has remained at about <PERCENT>24%</PERCENT> since <DATE>1970</DATE>. 
What has changed is that more of the young elderly are living with spouses rather than with other relatives, such as children. 
In <DATE>1988</DATE>, <PERCENT>10%</PERCENT> of those aged 65 to 74 lived with relatives other than spouses, down from <PERCENT>15%</PERCENT> in <DATE>1970</DATE>. 

   As people get even older, many become widowed. 
But even among those aged 75 and older, the share living with a spouse rose slightly, to <PERCENT>40%</PERCENT> in <DATE>1988</DATE> from <PERCENT>38%</PERCENT> in <DATE>1970</DATE>. 

   Like their younger counterparts, the older elderly are less likely to live with other relatives. 
Only <PERCENT>17%</PERCENT> of those aged 75 and older lived with relatives other than spouses in <DATE>1988</DATE>, down from <PERCENT>26%</PERCENT> in <DATE>1970</DATE>. 

   The likelihood of living alone beyond the age of 75 has increased to <PERCENT>40%</PERCENT> from <PERCENT>32%</PERCENT>. 
More people are remaining independent longer presumably because they are better off physically and financially. 

   Careers Count Most 

   For the Well-to-Do 

   MANY AFFLUENT people place personal success and money above family. 

   At least that's what a survey by <ORGANIZATION>Ernst &amp; Young</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Yankelovich</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Clancy</PERSON>, <PERSON>Shulman</PERSON> indicates. 
Two-thirds of respondents said they strongly felt the need to be successful in their jobs, while fewer than half said they strongly felt the need to spend more time with their families. 
Being successful in careers and spending the money they make are top priorities for this group. 

   Unlike most studies of the affluent market, this survey excluded the super-rich. 
Average household income for the sample was <MONEY>$194,000</MONEY>, and average net assets were reported as <MONEY>$775,000</MONEY>. 

   The goal was to learn about one of today's fastest-growing income groups, the upper-middle class. 
Although they represent only <PERCENT>2%</PERCENT> of the population, they control nearly one-third of discretionary income. 

   Across the board, these consumers value quality, buy what they like rather than just what they need, and appreciate products that are distinctive. 

   Despite their considerable incomes and assets, <PERCENT>40%</PERCENT> of the respondents in the study don't feel financially secure, and one-fourth don't feel that they have made it. 
Twenty percent don't even feel they are financially well off. 

   Many of the affluent aren't comfortable with themselves, either. 
About <PERCENT>40%</PERCENT> don't feel they're more able than others. 
While twothirds feel some guilt about being affluent, only <PERCENT>25%</PERCENT> give <MONEY>$2,500</MONEY> or more to charity each year. 

   Thirty-five percent attend religious services regularly; at the same time, <PERCENT>60%</PERCENT> feel that in life one sometimes has to compromise one's principles. 

   Odds and Ends 

   THE NUMBER of women and minorities who hold jobs in top management in the nation's largest banks has more than doubled since <DATE>1978</DATE>. 
The <ORGANIZATION>American Bankers Association</ORGANIZATION> says that women make up <PERCENT>47%</PERCENT> of officials and managers in the top 50 banks, up from <PERCENT>33%</PERCENT> in <DATE>1978</DATE>. 
The share of minorities in those positions has risen to <PERCENT>16%</PERCENT> from <PERCENT>12%</PERCENT>. . . . 
Per-capita personal income in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> grew faster than inflation last year, according to the <ORGANIZATION>Bureau of Economic Analysis</ORGANIZATION>. 
The amount of income divvied up for each man, woman and child was <MONEY>$16,489</MONEY> in <DATE>1988</DATE>, up <PERCENT>6.6%</PERCENT> from <MONEY>$15,472</MONEY> in <DATE>1987</DATE>. 
Per capita personal income ranged from <MONEY>$11,116</MONEY> in <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION> to <MONEY>$23,059</MONEY> in <LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION>. . . . 
There are 13.1 million students in college this <DATE>fall</DATE>, up <PERCENT>2%</PERCENT> from <DATE>1988</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>National Center for Education Statistics</ORGANIZATION> estimates. 
About <PERCENT>54%</PERCENT> are women, and <PERCENT>44%</PERCENT> are part-time students.

<HEAD>Northeast Slipping to Least Populated Region</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The densely settled <ORGANIZATION>Northeast</ORGANIZATION> has become the
nation's least populated region, falling behind the West for the
first time, the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> reported <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   The bureau also projected that <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> will surpass <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> for
second place behind <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> in population by <DATE>1995</DATE>.
   And between now and the <DATE>year 2000</DATE>, half of all <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> population
growth will occur in just three states: <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, the report said.
   The projections are based on assumptions about trends in births,
deaths, immigration and movement within the country, bureau
demographer <PERSON>Signe Wetrogen</PERSON> explained.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Northeast</ORGANIZATION> has been declining in its share of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
population, with less growth than other areas, <PERSON>Wetrogen</PERSON> said in a
telephone interview. ``It is the one region with the highest share
of population in the older ages, and has low birth rates.''
   Population shifts to the South and <LOCATION>West</LOCATION> in recent years have
drawn away many people in the prime ages of 18 to 24, ``so the
(Northeast) region is left with more older people, and it's left
without anybody to have more kids,'' she said.
   The Northeastern states, relatively smaller in land area than
other parts of the country, remain the mosty densely packed,
however. <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> leads the nation with more than 1,000 people
per square mile.
   Between <DATE>1987</DATE> and <DATE>1988</DATE>, the Western region increased from 49.6
million people to 50.5 million, the report said. At the same time,
the population of the <ORGANIZATION>Northeast</ORGANIZATION> edged upward from 50.1 million to
<MONEY>50.3 million</MONEY>, to slip into last place.
   The <DATE>1988</DATE> estimates listed the South with 85.1 million people,
followed by the <LOCATION>Midwest</LOCATION> with 59.6 million.
   Historical records show that, while it was the center of early
American development, the <ORGANIZATION>Northeast</ORGANIZATION> hasn't actually been the most
populous region since <DATE>1820</DATE>, when the South edged ahead. It remained
second until <DATE>1880</DATE>, falling to third behind both the <LOCATION>Midwest</LOCATION> and
South.
   By <DATE>1990</DATE>, the projections call for the South to have 87.3 million
people, followed by the <LOCATION>Midwest</LOCATION>, 59.8 million; West, 52.3 million;
and <ORGANIZATION>Northeast</ORGANIZATION>, 50.6 million.
   By <DATE>2000</DATE>, the counts are expected to be 96.9 million for the
South, 59.6 million for the <LOCATION>Midwest</LOCATION>, 59.4 million for the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION> and
51.8 million for the <ORGANIZATION>Northeast</ORGANIZATION>.
   By <DATE>2010</DATE>, the report added, the West could replace the <LOCATION>Midwest</LOCATION> as
the second-most-populous region.
   State population projections showed <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> remaining
unchallenged as the largest state, growing from 28 million people
today to 29.1 million in <DATE>1990</DATE> and 33.5 million in <DATE>2000</DATE>.
   <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> is expected to surpass <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> for second rank by <DATE>1995</DATE>.
The <ORGANIZATION>Empire State</ORGANIZATION> now leads <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> 17.7 million to 17.2 million, but
by <DATE>1995</DATE> Texas is projected to have just over 19 million people,
with <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> at only 17.9 million.
   <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> is expected to remain the fourth-largest state, although
by the year <DATE>2010</DATE> it may be closing in on <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> as well, the
<ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> said.
   By the <DATE>year 2000</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Illinois</ORGANIZATION> will have replaced <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> in
fifth place and <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION> will move into 10th, displacing <LOCATION>North
Carolina</LOCATION>, the report said.
   The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> population was projected to grow from 243.3 million in
<DATE>1987</DATE> to 267.7 million in <DATE>2000</DATE>.
   In that period, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> is expected to add 6 million
residents, <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> 3.5 million and <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> 3.3 million. That means
those states would have growth of 12.8 million people, <PERCENT>52 percent</PERCENT>
of the national increase of 24.4 million.
   <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>District of
Columbia</LOCATION> were projected to lose population this decade.
   Population losses in the <DATE>1990s</DATE> were predicted for nine more
states: <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wisconsin</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>North Dakota</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION>. On the other hand, growth
was predicted to resume in the <LOCATION>District of Columbia</LOCATION>.
   During the <DATE>1990s</DATE>, the maturing of the post-World War II Baby
Boom generation will be reflected in the growth of the 45-64 age
group in all parts of the country. The number of people aged 24 to
44 is expected to drop in the <LOCATION>Northeast</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Midwest</LOCATION> but grow
elsewhere, the report said.
   The study said the South continues to have the largest
percentage of blacks in its population, <PERCENT>16 percent</PERCENT>. More than half
of all black Americans reside in the <LOCATION>South</LOCATION>, and that is expected to
continue.

<HEAD>New Census Figures Could Affect Reapportionment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The populations of five states grew at rates
faster than <PERCENT>10 percent</PERCENT> in the <DATE>last half of the 1980s</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>Census
Bureau</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>Thursday</DATE> in a report that is causing revised estimates
for congressional reapportionment.
   The Census figures on state population, issued for release
<DATE>Friday</DATE>, showed Nevadawith the biggest population gain at <PERCENT>18 percent</PERCENT>
<DATE>from 1985</DATE> to the middle of <DATE>1989</DATE>. Arizona had the second highest
growth rate, at <PERCENT>12 percent</PERCENT>, followed by <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New Hampshire</LOCATION>
at <PERCENT>11 percent</PERCENT> and <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> at <PERCENT>10 percent</PERCENT>.
   Seven states lost population during the same period, the bureau
said: <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>North Dakota</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION>.
   The population figures are closely watched at the end of each
decade because they determine how many seats in the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. House of
Representatives</ORGANIZATION> each state will have. The next reapportionment will
be based on the final <DATE>1990</DATE> Census figures, which will be collected
in the 10-year census next year.
   The report issued <DATE>Thursday</DATE> represents one last checkpoint before
that final, official count, and two forecasting groups on <DATE>Thursday</DATE>
issued revised reapportionment predictions based on the trends.
   While the two reports varied on some specifics, they agreed on
the overall trend: states in the Sunbelt will generally pick up
seats lost by states in the <LOCATION>Northeast</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Midwest</LOCATION>.
   The non-profit <ORGANIZATION>Population Reference Bureau</ORGANIZATION> said that if the
trends in <DATE>Thursday</DATE>'s report hold true through the final <DATE>1990</DATE>
figures, 11 states are likely to lose one or more seats in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>
while seven will gain.
   It said <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> will lose three seats, <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> two, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>
two, <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> two, <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION> two, <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> one, <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION> one,
<LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION> one, <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION> one, <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION> one and <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> one.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Population Reference Bureau</ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> will gain seven
seats, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> will gain three, <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> three, <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> one, <LOCATION>North
Carolina</LOCATION> one, <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION> one and <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION> one.
   The comparable prediction by <ORGANIZATION>Election Data Services Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a
Washington-based political consulting firm, differed only for a few
states. It said <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> is likely to pick up four seats, rather
than three, and it added <LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION> to the list of those losing
seats, dropping one.
   There is still a wild card in the deck which cannot, at this
point, be predicted with certainty. The <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> figures on
which the projections are based do not include members of the
military and their dependents living overseas.
   The government recently announced that they will be counted in
the <DATE>1990</DATE> reapportionment. This change could tip the balance in some
states that now appear close to winning or losing a seat.

   Census Bureau
   Says It Missed
   2% of Population

   WASHINGTON -- The 1990 census missed more individuals --
both proportionately and in absolute numbers -- than in 1980,
undercounting the U.S. population by 2%, according to
preliminary findings by the Census Bureau.
   The new estimates could have far-reaching effects on
congressional redistricting and the allocation of federal
dollars to state and local governments.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The findings are based on two <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> projects: a
post-enumeration survey conducted in selected areas after the
<DATE>1990</DATE> census and a demographic analysis of state, local and
federal administrative records.
   The census count for <DATE>1990</DATE> is 248,709,873 nationwide.
According to the post-enumeration figures, however, the
census count should be somewhere between 252,982,000 and
254,989,000.
   Under a <DATE>1989</DATE> court order in a lawsuit brought by <LOCATION>New York
City</LOCATION> and several other cities, the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration must
decide by mid-July whether to adjust the <DATE>1990</DATE> count based on
the post-enumeration survey. The decision will be made after
<ORGANIZATION>Commerce</ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON>Robert Mosbacher</PERSON> reviews recommendations
by the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> and several independent experts
concerning the post-enumeration data.
   The post-enumeration findings "continue to strengthen the
case that failure to adjust will cause substantial damage in
many, many places across the country," said Rep. <PERSON>Tom Sawyer</PERSON>
(D., <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>), who heads the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> census and population
subcommittee.
   But Census officials were quick to warn that the
post-enumeration data could reflect errors in the
post-enumeration survey itself rather than in the census
count. "We know we have the symptoms of an undercount," said
<PERSON>C. Louis Kincannon</PERSON>, bureau deputy director. But he stressed
the need to make sure that the "cure is not worse than the
ailment."
   If the population count is adjusted, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> and other
Western states probably will gain the greatest benefits,
along with the <ORGANIZATION>District of Columbia</ORGANIZATION> and the rest of the
South-Atlantic region, according to the post-enumeration
estimates. In both regions, the census undercount was found
to be proportionally greater than it was for the entire <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
   The regions that will benefit the least from an adjustment
include <LOCATION>New England</LOCATION>, the Mid-Atlantic area and the <LOCATION>Midwest</LOCATION>.
No state figures are likely to be adjusted downward, but
population counts for certain cities and counties in states
such as <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> might be lowered, according to
bureau assistant director <PERSON>Peter Bounpane</PERSON>.
   Despite doubts about the post-enumeration data, it isn't
likely the bureau's demographic analysis data will change
significantly, <PERSON>Mr. Bounpane</PERSON> said. According to the analysis,
the <DATE>1990</DATE> census missed <PERCENT>1.8%</PERCENT> of the population, compared with
<PERCENT>1.3%</PERCENT> in <DATE>1980</DATE>.
   The undercount appears to be particularly sharp for
blacks. According to the bureau's demographic analysis, the
census failed to count <PERCENT>7.2%</PERCENT> of the black population, compared
with <PERCENT>4.7%</PERCENT> in <DATE>1980</DATE>. A bureau official said the black
population is harder to count than the population at large,
possibly because a high proportion of blacks are low-income.
A black majority in the <LOCATION>District of Columbia</LOCATION> may explain why
the census apparently missed a huge fraction of people living
in the bureau's back yard: According to the post-enumeration
survey, roughly <PERCENT>4%</PERCENT> to <PERCENT>8%</PERCENT> of all <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION>, residents
were uncounted.

Dividend From Tax Returns:
Details on Migration Patterns
---
By <PERSON>Eugene Carlson</PERSON>
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)
GOVMT
INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (IRS)
   THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE isn't the only federal agency peeking at your income-tax records. 
Sometime this <DATE>fall</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> will hand over to the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> a massive computer file containing personal and basic income information for everyone who filed a tax return for <DATE>1986</DATE>. 

   This sensitive transfer of tax records has been taking place annually since the early <DATE>1970s</DATE>, when the aim was to determine how to divide <MONEY>billions of dollars</MONEY> of federal revenue-sharing money among communities. 

   But revenue sharing is dead. 
These days, the tax records are mostly used to trace movement of the American public from place to place. 
The migration figures, purged of names and income, can be purchased from the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION>. 
A bank in a high-growth area, for example, could use the figures to see precisely where its potential new customers are arriving from. 

   THE MIGRATION PROJECT is statistically awesome. 
Using your Social Security number, the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> will compare the address that you printed on your <DATE>1986</DATE> tax return with the address on your previous year's tax form. 
The idea is to see if you changed residence between tax filings and, if so, from where to where. 

   A similar address scan is done on every other individual tax return. 
Matching the estimated 103 million returns filed for <DATE>1986</DATE> with the roughly 99 million from <DATE>1985</DATE>, adding the number of exemptions claimed, and charting where everybody moved down to the county level is no small data-processing chore. 
The project will tie up the bureau's huge Univac 1100/84 computer for some 700 hours, a computer run roughly equivalent to the first tally of the entire <DATE>1990</DATE> national census. 

   When the address information is combined with the number of exemptions claimed by the tax filer, the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> data yield the single best picture of population migration available during the 10 years between national head counts. 

   This sort of intelligence is solid gold to market researchers, developers and planners who are forever seeking better ways of predicting and charting state or regional population growth. 
Migration data is vital in the local growth equation because what sets the growth rate of one area apart from another is almost entirely the movement of people. 
Birth and death rates, the other main population components, are relatively constant throughout the nation. 

   DEMOGRAPHERS USE voter registrations, auto registrations, school enrollments, and other social indicators to figure out whether a state is gaining or losing population through migration. 
What the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> figures show in addition to this are the origins and destinations of these migrants. 

   The <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> numbers, for example, illuminate the strong population flow between <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> and show how that stream has reversed in the last decade. 
At the end of the <DATE>1970s</DATE>, some 5,000 more people were moving to <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION> from <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> each year than were leaving <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION> for <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>. 

   Over the next few years, <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION>'s attraction for Californians gradually diminished, and by <DATE>1983</DATE> the migrant flow between the two states was about equal. 
The most recent <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> figures show that the flow has tilted steeply toward <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> with net in-migration of 5,400 Coloradans in the year ended <DATE>April 15, 1985</DATE>. 

   Arizona pulled a net 4,400 residents from <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION> in the latest reporting year. 
The states with the biggest net population losses to <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION>: <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION>. 

   New Jersey massaged the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> data and found that it is pulling in people from heavily populated Northern states such as <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION>, while losing residents, on balance, to increasingly urbanized states in the <LOCATION>South and West</LOCATION>, such as <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION>. 

   ARMED WITH this knowledge, a <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> demographer assumes that most of those leaving for <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> are retirees, while most of the <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION> newcomers are in the active labor market. 
The makeup of these two migrant streams has very different implications for the state's future population. 

   The <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> data isn't a perfect migration mirror. 
Because it only catches tax filers, migrants below the income-filing threshold don't show up on the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> printouts. 
The <DATE>1986</DATE> tax law, which eliminates still more people from the tax rolls, will make the movement of low-income Americans, many of them elderly, even harder to trace. 

   The <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION>'s migration methodology also assumes that all the exemptions listed on a tax form change residence when the tax filer does. 
That isn't always so, as in the case of divorced couples where one parent has custody of the children, and the other has financial support. 
A single person who marries, moves and the next year files a joint return, is also lost in this tabulation. 

   Addresses can be a problem for the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION>, especially at the local level. 
Taxpayers sometimes list post-office-box numbers on their return from a different jurisdiction than their home. 

   Affluent taxpayers sometimes file from the offices of their lawyers or accountants. 
The world knows that President <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> has been in residence in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION>, since <DATE>1981</DATE>. 
But on their Form 1040 filed two weeks ago, President and <PERSON>Mrs. Reagan</PERSON> gave their address as 333 <LOCATION>South Grand</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>. 
That's the office address of <ORGANIZATION>Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Reagans</ORGANIZATION>' attorneys. 

   When it comes to migration, the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION>'s computer thinks the <ORGANIZATION>First Family</ORGANIZATION> lives in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>.

Fewer People
Living Alone

   Is living alone passe? 

   That's what the latest annual statistics on <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> households suggest. 

   For the first time since the mid-1960s, the growth in non-family households -- mainly singles -- came to a virtual halt this year, according to the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION>'s latest Current Population Survey. 
In the <DATE>1970s</DATE>, the number of such households soared <PERCENT>77.7%</PERCENT>, five times the rise in family households. 

   "It's pretty amazing," says <PERSON>Peter Francese</PERSON>, president of American Demographics magazine. 
"Most demographic trends don't disappear that quickly." 

   One year's statistic doesn't always portend a trend, and young adults are still much more likely to live alone today than they were a generation ago. 
Still, the rise in single-member households has been slowing since the early <DATE>1980s</DATE>, when there was a recession. 
That's when many newly jobless young adults moved back with Mom and Dad. 

   Demographers cite several theories for the singles standstill. 
<PERSON>Andrew Cherlin</PERSON>, a professor of sociology at <ORGANIZATION>Johns Hopkins University</ORGANIZATION>, believes more young adults are living at home after school and before they marry to save money and get established in a career. 
Census Bureau figures support that view, showing that the percentage of people 18-to-24 years old living with their parents increased to <PERCENT>52.6%</PERCENT> in <DATE>1986</DATE> from <PERCENT>48.4%</PERCENT> in <DATE>1980</DATE>. 

   "I asked a cousin whose children are finishing college how she would enjoy being an 'empty-nester,'" <PERSON>Mr. Cherlin</PERSON> says. 
"She smiled ruefully and said, 'They're all coming back home.'" 

   The plateau in the number of non-family households -- about 25 million of the 89.5 million total <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> households -- also may reflect the shrinking ranks of young adults, who are more likely to live alone. 
The number of people 18-to-24 years old has declined about <PERCENT>10%</PERCENT> since <DATE>1980</DATE>. 

   Furthermore, <PERSON>Arlene Saluter</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> specialist in marriage and family statistics, suspects the cost of living -- especially high housing costs -- has climbed above the ability of many young adults to manage without getting married to another wage earner or living with parents. 
Indeed, that population is the only age group to experience a drop in income since <DATE>1980</DATE>. 
The median household income of the 15-to-24-year-old group declined <PERCENT>9.5%</PERCENT> to <MONEY>$15,300</MONEY> in <DATE>1986</DATE> from <MONEY>$16,900</MONEY> in <DATE>1980</DATE>, after adjusting for inflation. 

   At the same time that fewer people are deciding to live alone, more people are getting married -- further diminishing the relative statistical importance of the living-alone crowd. 
In fact, married couples made up nearly <PERCENT>60%</PERCENT> of new households formed in the past year, up from <PERCENT>35%</PERCENT> the year earlier and just <PERCENT>12%</PERCENT> in 1983-1984 period. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Francese</PERSON> attributes the rise in the number of marriages to the fact that Americans born in <DATE>1957</DATE> -- the peak post-war baby-boom year -- are turning 30. 
"As people get older, they tend to marry and settle down," he says. 

   Last year, the median age of women getting married -- 23.1 years -- was the highest since the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> began compiling such data in the late 1800s. (The previous high was 22 years, in the 1890s). 
For men, the median age for marrying was 25.7 in <DATE>1986</DATE>, still slightly below the peak 25.9 years in <DATE>1900</DATE>. 

   Whatever the reasons, the shift away from non-family households may affect the economy in numerous ways. 
Demand for rental apartments may fall, for instance. 
"It suggests a shift away from rental units, such as one-bedroom apartments to owner-occupied dwellings," says <PERSON>William Serow</PERSON>, an economics professor and associate director of <ORGANIZATION>Florida State University's Center for Population Studies</ORGANIZATION>. 

   Meanwhile, restaurants may see less business as young adults living with their parents opt for more home-cooked meals. 
And <PERSON>Ms. Saluter</PERSON> suggests that young adults staying at home actually will have more spending money for consumer goods. 
"I know I'd have a lot more money if I lived with my mother," she says.

   In the politics of the future, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> will
exercise more clout than any smoke-filled room of politicians ever
did.
   <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> emerges from the <DATE>1990</DATE> census as a political behemoth,
with 52 <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> seats, a population bigger than <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>'s and <PERCENT>20
percent</PERCENT> of the electoral votes needed to be elected president.
   Add together the congressional representation of 21 states and
they still will total fewer than the delegation from <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>,
which swells by seven in <DATE>1992</DATE>, the result of a <PERCENT>26 percent</PERCENT> surge in
population in the <DATE>last 10 years</DATE>.
   The news is nothing but promising for Republicans. <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>
hasn't voted for a Democratic presidential candidate since <DATE>1964</DATE>;
except for <PERSON>Jimmy Carter</PERSON> in <DATE>1976</DATE>, no one has won the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION>

   Republicans can find more cheer in most of the other shifts in

the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
   The industrial <ORGANIZATION>Northeast</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Midwest</LOCATION> will lose standing in
<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> and the electoral college. The West, the South and the Sun
Belt, increasingly Republican, gain.
   ``The political consequences advantage the Republicans,'' summed
up <PERSON>Stephen Hess</PERSON>, political analyst at the <ORGANIZATION>Brookings Institution</ORGANIZATION>, a
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> research organization.
   The census sets the stage, as well, for brutal redistricting
battles from coast to coast, promising to generate nasty
colleague-versus-colleague races in some of the 13 states where the
number of <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> seats must shrink.
   <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> will suffer the biggest loss, three seats, and on the
streets of <LOCATION>Brooklyn</LOCATION>, that could come down to a brawl between two
Democratic incumbents, Reps. <PERSON>Charles Schumer</PERSON> and <PERSON>Stephen Solarz</PERSON>.
They may have to compete for a single seat.
   It is no coincidence, <PERSON>Hess</PERSON> observed, that <PERSON>Schumer</PERSON> and <PERSON>Solarz</PERSON>
have built up campaign warchests in the million-dollar range, each
anticipating a costly battle - or perhaps a race elsewhere, maybe
taking on Republican <PERSON>Alfonse M. D'Amato</PERSON> for his <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> seat.
   Four states lose two <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> members - <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>, going to 20;
<LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>, to 16; <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, to 19; and <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>, to 21.
   Eight states will lose one each - <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>, down to five; <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION>, to
four; <LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION>, to six; <LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION>, to seven; <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION>, to 10;
<LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>, to one; <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION>, to 13; and <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION>, to three.
   Among the gainers are <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, up four to 23, and <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> up three
to 30. And one additional seat in the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> will go to five states
- <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>, going to six; <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION>, to 11; <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION>, to 12;
<LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION>, to 11; and <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, to nine.
   But it is <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> where the gains are most dramatic. In
<DATE>January 1993</DATE>, that state will have more representatives than 21
other states combined - <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Delaware</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>North Dakota</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>South Dakota</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Vermont</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New
Hampshire</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Rhode Island</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New Mexico</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION>.
   All states except the six which now have only one representative
- <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Delaware</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>North Dakota</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>South Dakota</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Vermont</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION>
- will have to redraw congressional boundaries. The purpose is to
give each representative 572,466 constituents, or as close to that
figure as possible.
   The cry of gerrymandering - rigging election lines to favor one
party - is sure to be heard. In <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, the election of
Republican <PERSON>Pete Wilson</PERSON> as governor will serve as a check if the
Democratic legislature tries to squeeze out Republicans, already
outnumbered 27-18.
   Elsewhere, black leaders in <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> have served notice that
they want the new lines drawn to create districts where blacks have
substantial majorities and a chance to elect a member of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``We will oppose any friend or fight any foe to ensure that
there is a black congressional district in <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> in <DATE>1991</DATE>,'' <PERSON>Jack
Gravely</PERSON>, president of that state's <ORGANIZATION>NAACP</ORGANIZATION>, announced last fall.
   <PERSON>Curtis Gans</PERSON>, director of the non-partisan <ORGANIZATION>Committee</ORGANIZATION> for the
Study of the <ORGANIZATION>American Electorate</ORGANIZATION>, disputed what he said was the
widespread view of the census figures as a ``windfall for the
Republicans.''
   Most states that picked up new seats did so because of growing
Hispanic populations, <PERSON>Gans</PERSON> said, and he predicted that Hispanics
will become increasingly loyal Democrats.
   ``Hispanics of the class that is expanding the population in
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New Mexico</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION> tend to vote 2-1
Democratic,'' he said. ``Eventually that's going to tell - probably
within the next decade.''
   Only in <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, where Cuban-Americans favor conservative
candidates, can the Republicans anticipate long-term gains, he
said.

<HEAD>Northeast Slips to Least Populated Region</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For the first time, the wide-open spaces of
the American West contain more people than the densely-packed
<ORGANIZATION>Northeast</ORGANIZATION>, and the rapid Western growth will continue, the <ORGANIZATION>Census
Bureau</ORGANIZATION> says.
   The bureau predicts that between now and the year <DATE>2000</DATE> more than
half of all national population growth will occur in just three
states _ <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>.
   The study adds that <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> is on the verge of crowding past <LOCATION>New
York</LOCATION> as the nation's second most populous state. The projections
call for <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> to surpass <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> by <DATE>1995</DATE>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Empire State</ORGANIZATION> now leads <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> 17.7 million to 17.2 million.
But by <DATE>1995</DATE>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> is expected to have just over 19 million people,
with <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> at only 17.9 million.
   That transition is symbolic of the slippage in the <ORGANIZATION>Northeast</ORGANIZATION>,
which has become the nation's least populated region, falling
behind the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION> for the first time.
   Bureau demographer <PERSON>Signe Wetrogen</PERSON> explained that the projections
are based on assumptions about trends in births, deaths,
immigration and movement within the country.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Northeast</ORGANIZATION> has been declining in its share of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
population, with less growth than other areas, she said.
   ``It is the one region with the highest share of population in
the older ages, and has low birth rates,'' she explained.
   Population shifts to the South and <LOCATION>West</LOCATION> in recent years have
drawn away many people in the prime ages of 18 to 24, she said.
   ``So the (Northeast) region is left with more older people, and
it's left without anybody to have more kids,'' she said.
   But because it is smaller in area than other parts of the
country, the <LOCATION>Northeastern</LOCATION> states remain the most densely packed.
<LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> leads the nation with more than 1,000 people per square
mile.
   Tables included with the report show that between <DATE>1987</DATE> and <DATE>1988</DATE>
the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION> region increased from 49.6 million people to <MONEY>50.5 million</MONEY>.
At the same the <ORGANIZATION>Northeast</ORGANIZATION> edged up only from 50.1 million to 50.3
million.
   The <DATE>1988</DATE> estimates list the South with 85.1 million people,
followed by the <LOCATION>Midwest</LOCATION> with 59.6 million.
   While it was the center of early American development, the
<ORGANIZATION>Northeast</ORGANIZATION> hasn't been the most populous region since <DATE>1820</DATE>, when the
South edged ahead. It remained second until <DATE>1880</DATE>, when it fell to
third behind the <LOCATION>Midwest</LOCATION>.
   By <DATE>1990</DATE> the projections call for the South to have 87.3 million
people, followed by the <LOCATION>Midwest</LOCATION>, 59.8 million; West, 52.3 million
and <ORGANIZATION>Northeast</ORGANIZATION>, 50.6. million. By the <DATE>year 2000</DATE> the counts are
expected to be South, 96.9 million; <LOCATION>Midwest</LOCATION>, 59.6 million; West,
59.4 million, <ORGANIZATION>Northeast</ORGANIZATION>, 51.8 million.
   By <DATE>2010</DATE>, the report adds, the West could surpass the <LOCATION>Midwest</LOCATION> and
be the second most populous region.
   The projections show <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> remaining the most heavily
populated state, growing from 28 million people today to 29.1
million in <DATE>1990</DATE> and 33.5 million in <DATE>2000</DATE>.
   <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> is expected to remain the fourth largest, though by the
year <DATE>2010</DATE> it may be closing in on <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> also.
   By the <DATE>year 2000</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Illinois</ORGANIZATION> will have replaced <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> in
fifth place and <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION> will move into 10th, displacing <LOCATION>North
Carolina</LOCATION>, the report says.
   The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> is expected to grow from 243.3 million people in <DATE>1987</DATE>
to 267.7 million in <DATE>2000</DATE>, an increase of 24.4 million.
   In that period, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> is expected to add 6 million, <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>
3.5 million and <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> 3.3 million. The three-state total of 12.8
million people represents <PERCENT>52 percent</PERCENT> of the projected national
increase.
   Predicted to lose population in this decade are the <ORGANIZATION>District of
Columbia</ORGANIZATION> and four states; <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>West
Virginia</LOCATION>.
   In the <DATE>1990s</DATE> population losses are expected in those states and
nine others: <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wisconsin</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>North Dakota</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION>. On the other hand, things
are expected to turn around in the <LOCATION>District of Columbia</LOCATION>, with
growth resuming in the '90s.

<TEXT>
   While public concern focuses on how imports
affect <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> jobs, nearly 4.6 million American workers owe their
livelihoods to exports, the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> reported <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   For example, one of every eight people working in manufacturing
is in an export-related job, the <ORGANIZATION>Bureau</ORGANIZATION> found.
   The analysis of employment in <DATE>1986</DATE> showed an increase of 163,400
export-related jobs from the year before.
   Manufacturing accounted for the bulk of the export-related jobs,
2,318,200 in <DATE>1986</DATE>, the most recent year for which figures are
available, the report said.
   In addition, exports accounted for 994,500 jobs in trade, 298,400
in transportation, 247,900 in business services and 717,600 jobs in
such areas as mining and agriculture, the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> reported.
   On a national basis, exports accounted for <PERCENT>12.6 percent</PERCENT> of all
manufacturing jobs, the report said.
   Alaska leads the pack with fully <PERCENT>40 percent</PERCENT> of its manufacturing
jobs being export related. <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION> has a relatively small total of
manufacturing workers, so that <PERCENT>40 percent</PERCENT> amounts to only 3,600 jobs.
   <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> has the most export-related manufacturing jobs at
289,600. That's <PERCENT>14.7 percent</PERCENT> of the <ORGANIZATION>Golden State</ORGANIZATION>'s workers in
manufacturing industries.
   Nationally, electronic equipment accounted for the largest number
of export-related jobs at 459,600, according to the new analysis.
   The next largest category was machinery other than electrical
equipment, providing 378,300 jobs for Americans.
   Making transportation equipment for export provided 224,000 jobs.
Next was fabricated metal products at 188,400 jobs, followed by
182,000 administrative and auxiliary jobs, primary metal industries
offering 159,500 positions, and 130,400 workers making chemicals and
related products.
   Here is a state-by-state rundown of the percentage of
manufacturing jobs related to export in <DATE>1986</DATE> as reported in the new

   The <DATE>1990</DATE> census could cost an extra <MONEY>$100
million</MONEY> or more, Census Director <PERSON>Barbara E. Bryant</PERSON> said <DATE>today</DATE> as
she urged Americans who have not returned their forms to do so.
   It could cost the bureau an extra <MONEY>$10 million</MONEY> to count each <PERCENT>1
percent</PERCENT> of citizens who don't mail back their forms, she told the
<ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> census subcommittee. Currently the response rate is <PERCENT>7 percent</PERCENT>
below plan.
   Asked if the total shortfall would be close to <MONEY>$100 million</MONEY>,
<PERSON>Bryant</PERSON> said, ``it could be more than that.''
   Some 4.8 million census forms have been returned by the post
office as undeliverable. Detailed plans exist to send workers out
to count people on their doorsteps.
   ``We plan to follow up on every housing unit for which a
questionnaire was not returned and we have the workforce to do
it,'' she said.
   The census is not over, <PERSON>Bryant</PERSON> emphasized, calling on Americans
to mail back their forms. Workers will begin visitimg homes next
week, but the bureau is always happy to get mailed-back forms, she
said.
   Currently, <PERCENT>63 percent</PERCENT> of households have mailed back their
census forme, she said. The bureau had hoped for a <PERCENT>70 percent</PERCENT> mail
response.
   Census workers have been hand-delivering forms to many of the
missed blocks and buildings, a process that has delayed response in
many areas. Thus, the bureau continues to urge people to fill out
the forms and send them back although the count officially took
place on <DATE>April 1</DATE>.
   The updated figures show <LOCATION>Wisconsin</LOCATION> as the most responsive state,
with <PERCENT>74.5 percent</PERCENT> of households having sent back their forms.
<LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION> is trailing at <PERCENT>47.1 percent</PERCENT>.
   Among major cities, <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> was leading with a <PERCENT>71.9
percent</PERCENT> response rate.
   Other major cities with high return rates included <LOCATION>Indianapolis</LOCATION>,
<PERCENT>68.6 percent</PERCENT>; Minneapolis-St. Paul, <PERCENT>66.2 percent</PERCENT>; <LOCATION>El Paso</LOCATION>, <PERCENT>64.9

   <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> was last at <PERCENT>45.4 percent</PERCENT> and <LOCATION>New Orleans</LOCATION> was also low at

million people -- making up one-quarter of the nation's households -- live

<TEXT>     New social trends;  Taken together, the statistics reflect a web of social
trends in American society since <DATE>1960</DATE>, ranging from more elderly widows living
independently to low birth rates to young people delaying marriage. In <DATE>1960</DATE>,
for example, half of all women were married before they were 20, while the
median age today is closer to 24.;    "The share of households, of what we
call mom-and-pop households, is shrinking," said <PERSON>Don Starsinic</PERSON>, chief of the
population distribution branch at the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau.</ORGANIZATION>;    And the effect can be
seen everywhere, from the prevalence of single-serving packages available in
the grocery to the popularity of townhouses in the suburbs and the ubiquitous
advertisements for singles apartments.;    "In the <DATE>1960s</DATE>, if you were in your
mid-20s and not married, people would look at you quizzically," said <PERSON>Carl
Haub</PERSON>, a demographer at the <ORGANIZATION>Population Reference Bureau</ORGANIZATION>. "Obviously, today,
that's completely turned around . . . More and more younger Americans are
living a single life first.";    The proportion of the population living alone
last year, derived from the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION>'s Current Population Survey, has
increased sharply since <DATE>1970</DATE>, when 11 million Americans, or <PERCENT>17 percent</PERCENT> of the
population, were in single-person households.;    Experts disagree on the
implications of that figure, with some seeing it as a sign that more people
can afford to live independently, and others fearing that it signals a society
living in increasing isolation and loneliness.;    "People are able to escape
problematic relationships but have difficulty making positive social ties,"
said <PERSON>Frances Goldscheider</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Brown University</ORGANIZATION> sociologist who studies the
family.;    "What the literature seems to be saying is that relationships are
good for us," she said. "So the question is, are people living alone (because
they are) fleeing bad relationships . . . or are they being so careful to
avoid bad relationships that they end up with nothing?";    A second major
factor driving up the number of single-person households -- the increase in
elderly living alone -- also prompts divergent interpretations. While it stems
in part from social programs allowing older Americans to remain financially
independent, it also reflects a decreasing tendency for families to take in
their aging parents.;    And living alone in old age, said <PERSON>Goldscheider</PERSON>, can
be "dangerously isolating.";    The census showed that the average number of
persons living in a household was 2.63 in <DATE>1990</DATE>, down from 3.11 in <DATE>1970</DATE>. A
century ago, the typical American household included about five persons, and
the number has dropped steadily since.;    The decline in household size was
most dramatic in the <DATE>1970s</DATE>, when it fell by nearly <PERCENT>12 percent</PERCENT>. The trend
continued in the <DATE>last decade</DATE>, but at a slower pace, driven by a different set
of factors.;    "During the <DATE>'80s</DATE>, the major contributor was the shift to
single-person households," <PERSON>Starsinic</PERSON> said, "whereas in the '70s the period of
declining fertility had a major impact on a very, very large decline in
population per household.";    <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> bucks trend;  <ORGANIZATION>Nationally</ORGANIZATION>, only
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION> reported an increase in household size since <DATE>1980</DATE>, a phenomenon
demographers attribute to the large number of Hispanic households, which are
younger and tend to have more children.;    <ORGANIZATION>The Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> also reported
that <PERCENT>10 percent</PERCENT> of the nation's housing units were vacant in <DATE>1990</DATE>, the largest
proportion in 50 years.;    <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> housing specialist <PERSON>Bill Downs</PERSON> said
that figure, up from <PERCENT>7.6 percent</PERCENT> in <DATE>1970</DATE>, reflects a downturn in the economy
in certain regions, an increase in vacation homes that would be considered
vacant for a portion of the year and overbuilding in some areas.  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Dinkins Says Census Bureau Missed 1 Million New Yorkers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Mayor <PERSON>David Dinkins</PERSON> has accused the <ORGANIZATION>Census
Bureau</ORGANIZATION> of skipping one out of every 13 housing units and missing up
to 1 million residents in its preliminary <DATE>1990</DATE> count of the city's
population.
   <PERSON>Dinkins</PERSON> said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> the city is filing a challenge to the
government's figures. Federal aid and representation in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>
are determined by the Census count.
   ``The <DATE>1990</DATE> undercount could cost us up to <MONEY>$1 billion</MONEY> in lost
federal aid, or <MONEY>$150</MONEY> for each man, woman and child living in our
city,'' he said. <PERSON>Dinkins</PERSON> also said the count could cost the city at
least one seat in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>.
   The mayor said the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> failed to count 254,534 housing
units, undercounting the city's population by 800,000 to 1 million.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Bureau</ORGANIZATION> counted 7.033 million people in the city. The
<ORGANIZATION>Department of City Planning</ORGANIZATION> estimates 8 million people live in the
city.
   ``It is statistically stunning and demographically absurd for
the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> to claim that a city whose resident birth rate
has risen by at least <PERCENT>23 percent</PERCENT> and which has welcomed more than
800,000 legal immigrants to its shores during the past decade has
actually lost population,'' the mayor said.
   The city was given 15 business days to review the <ORGANIZATION>Bureau</ORGANIZATION>'s <DATE>1990</DATE>
preliminary figures. It did so by analyzing data from the city, <ORGANIZATION>Con
Edison</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>New York Telephone Co.</ORGANIZATION>, as well as consulting
surveys, atlases and aerial photographs.
   In his letter to <PERSON>Sheila Grimm</PERSON>, regional director of the <ORGANIZATION>Census
Bureau</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Dinkins</PERSON> asked that the bureau review some 11,900 city
blocks - approximately <PERCENT>43 percent</PERCENT> of the city's more than 28,000
residential blocks.
   The bureau has said it would take 10 days to review the city's
challenge.
   In a three-block area in one section of <LOCATION>Queens</LOCATION>, the city counted
567 housing units in what it said was a neighborhood of one-and
two-family homes; the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> counted zero units.
   Neighborhoods with minority populations, in general, tended to
be undercounted by the bureau, said <PERSON>Richard Schaffer</PERSON>, director of
the <ORGANIZATION>Department of City Planning</ORGANIZATION> and chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>City Planning
Commission</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>Dinkins</PERSON> said the <DATE>1980</DATE> undercount, put by the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> at
450,000, cost <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION> some <MONEY>$675 million</MONEY> in federal aid during
the ensuing 10 years.

<LEADPARA>  More Americans lived in urban areas in the 1980s than at any other time in
U.S. history, the Census Bureau reported Tuesday.;   In part, the urban growth
was fueled by an influx into the cities of foreign immigrants and small-town
dwellers fleeing depressed economic conditions. But it was also a result of
so-called urban sprawl -- the gradual overtaking of suburban and rural areas
by urban centers.  </LEADPARA>

187.1 million Americans, or <PERCENT>75.2 percent</PERCENT> of the nation's population, lived in
big cities or their suburbs at the end of the decade, marking an all-time
high.;   In <DATE>1980</DATE>, 167.1 million, or <PERCENT>73.7 percent</PERCENT>, lived in urban areas.;   By

rose by a slightly slower rate -- from 59.5 million to 61.7 million.;  
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION> had the highest percentage of urban residents -- <PERCENT>92.6 percent</PERCENT>; it
also has the most urban land, 8,175.4 square miles. In <DATE>1980</DATE>, <PERCENT>91.3 percent</PERCENT> of

the most rural land, 569,733.3 square miles.;   Increase in rural residents;  
The <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> also found that 11 states increased their percentage of
rural residents during the <DATE>1980s</DATE>, compared with 19 states from <DATE>1970</DATE> to 1980.; 
 <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>North Dakota</LOCATION> were the only states where the majority of

of urban dwellers has risen steadily since census demographers first noted in
<DATE>1920</DATE> that a majority of Americans lived in cites.;   The trend toward urban
growth generally parallels employment opportunities, which historically have
moved from rural areas to urban ones, said <PERSON>Larry Long</PERSON>, a housing and household
demographer at the Census Bureau.;   Long also noted that the pace of
immigration increased during the decade, helping fuel the cities' growth.;  
"There was less growth (nationally) due to immigration during the <DATE>1970s</DATE>, but
in the '80s there was tremendous growth," he said. "Virtually all immigrants
go to cities and stay there."  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Boomer's Babies Still Increasing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The offspring of the <ORGANIZATION>Baby Boomers</ORGANIZATION> are
continuing their sharp increase of recent years, the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION>
reported today.
   The number of Americans aged 5 and under totaled 18.3 million as
of <DATE>1987</DATE>, up from 18.2 million in <DATE>1986</DATE> and just over 18 million the
year before that.
   Still, the total is well short of the 20.5 million preschoolers
recorded in <DATE>1961</DATE>, near the end of the post World War II Baby Boom.
   Population experts stress that the current surge in tots does
not constitute another boom, but rather is an ``echo'' of that
earlier one, since the great mass of people born in the two decades
following that war are now producing their own families.
   This increase has been underway for several years, with the
number of Americans under age 5 up by 1.9 million from <DATE>1980 to 1987</DATE>.
   Meanwhile, the number aged 5 to 17 has declined in this decade,
slipping from 47.4 million in <DATE>1980</DATE> to 45.3 million in the <DATE>1987</DATE>
estimates.
   In the same period, those aged 18 to 24 declined from 30.0
million to 27.1 million, while all other age groups increased.
   Other findings of the study included:
   _<LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION> both registered population losses for the
first time in this decade, as the continuing slowdown in the energy
industry affected growth rates in several states. Declines
continued in <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION>.
   _Population loss also affected agricultural states, with
declines reported for <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>North Dakota</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION>.

   <PERSON>Jesse Jackson</PERSON> brushed aside two more
primary losses to Democratic presidential rival <PERSON>Michael Dukakis</PERSON> and
looked ahead to the races remaining in the final month of the
primary season.
   <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON> was campaigning today in <LOCATION>Oregon</LOCATION>, which holds its primary
next <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
   ``<LOCATION>Oregon</LOCATION> is very important to us,'' <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON> said as he arrived
in the state. ``One must come to <LOCATION>Oregon</LOCATION> on the way to <DATE>June 7</DATE>.''
   <DATE>June 7</DATE> is the day that <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION>, along with
<LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New Mexico</LOCATION>, hold their primaries. Jackson offered
<PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON> congratulations for his wins on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> in <LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION>, but vowed to fight on for the nomination.
   ``We will take it all the way to the end,'' <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON> said. ``The
race is on, and the race is live.''
   <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON> told a news conference that <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON> may have the lead in
the race for the nomination but ``I represent the people.''
   Jackson planned to spend three days in <LOCATION>Oregon</LOCATION>, far more than
front-runner <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON>. The two will be fighting for a share of the
45 Democratic national convention delegates at stake in <LOCATION>Oregon</LOCATION>.
   ``We know the people of <LOCATION>Oregon</LOCATION> are an independent-thinking
people. We expect a tremendous response from the people of
<LOCATION>Oregon</LOCATION>,'' <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON> said. ``For too long, the great <ORGANIZATION>Northwest</ORGANIZATION> has
been ignored and abandoned in national politics.''
   At an airport news conference, <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON> called for freezing
military spending for five years and using the money for social
programs.
   He also said immediate steps need to be taken to attack the
country's serious drug problem.
   ``The No. 1 threat to our existence is the flow of cocaine and
crack and heroin,'' <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON> said.
   Jackson also campaigned <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> in <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>, visiting the
Flathead Indian Reservation.
   ``It is still a close race _ much closer than it is being
portrayed,'' <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON> told a cheering crowd.
   He was accompanied to the reservation by actress <PERSON>Margot Kidder</PERSON>,
who campaigned with him a day earlier in <LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION>.
   In <LOCATION>Oregon</LOCATION>, a statewide poll of Democrats, taken in <DATE>mid-April</DATE>,
suggested <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON> was favored over <LOCATION>Jackson</LOCATION>, <PERCENT>48 percent</PERCENT> to <PERCENT>28
percent</PERCENT>.

<TEXT>
   In a backroads town where being a good
neighbor is as important as church on <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, the prospect of a
nuclear waste dump has spawned an economic boycott and discordant
civic meetings. It's pitted friend against friend.
   In <DATE>January</DATE>, <LOCATION>Boyd County</LOCATION>, a sparsely populated agricultural area
on the <LOCATION>South Dakota</LOCATION> border, became one of three semifinalist sites
in <LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION> for a low-level radioactive waste dump.
   ``It's the most tragic thing that's ever happened here,'' said
<PERSON>Lowell Fisher</PERSON>, a third-generation rancher who's chairman of the
``Save <ORGANIZATION>Boyd County Association</ORGANIZATION>.''
   ``We're not anti-nuke kooks, we're not a bunch of political
activists, we're babes in the woods when it comes to trying to stop
this. But we live in God's country and we don't want everybody
else's garbage.''
   Fisher's group has garnered 1,107 signatures against the dump.
About 3,000 people live in <LOCATION>Boyd County</LOCATION>, and 1,499 voted in the last
general election.
   But <PERSON>J.C. Marcum</PERSON>, a retired <PERSON>Spencer</PERSON> veterinarian who heads
``People For Progress In <LOCATION>Boyd County</LOCATION>,'' is delighted the dump might
be located within 12 miles of his home.
   ``Outside rabble rousers have teamed up with local kooks to
coerce people into being against the waste site,'' said <PERSON>Marcum</PERSON>.
``These farmers don't read very much, they aren't educated on the
issue. They think their property values will be lower, but in fact
they'll be higher, and we may get as many as 40 new jobs out of it.''
   He criticized the dump opponents for boycotting businesses owned
by supporters. ``People I've known for 35 years won't speak to me,
but that doesn't bother me. I've got a thick hide.''
   About <MONEY>$2 million</MONEY> will be spent this year to study surface and
ground water, geology, topography, and environmental resources of
320 acres in <LOCATION>Boyd County</LOCATION>, along with similar acreage in two other
semifinalist counties: <PERSON>Nuckolls</PERSON> on the <LOCATION>Nebraska-Kansas</LOCATION> border, and
<LOCATION>Nemaha</LOCATION> on the Nebraska-Iowa line near the <LOCATION>Missouri River</LOCATION>.
   The dump is designed to be an above-ground reinforced concrete
vault capable of storing five million cubic feet of waste. Its
lifespan will be 30 years or full capacity, whichever comes first.
Radioactive refuse will be trucked in from five states.
   The semifinalist sites, picked in <DATE>January</DATE>, resulted from a
months-long winnowing process. Eighty communities at first expressed
interest in the dump's potential jobs and fees _ an estimated <MONEY>$40
million</MONEY> over three decades for local and state government _ but
eventually almost all declined: Not in my backyard.
   A dead black cat in his mailbox caused a <LOCATION>Webster County</LOCATION>
commissioner to switch his vote from favoring to opposing the site
in his county. Letters to the editor got bitter and personal.
   ``As long as our governor (<PERSON>Kay Orr</PERSON>) and state oppose the right of
the people to vote on the waste site being placed in their county,''
wrote <PERSON>Fisher</PERSON>, ``strife will only increase.''
   Federal law mandates that every state have a dump for its
low-level radioactive garbage _ mostly tools, clothing and resin
from nuclear power plants _ by <DATE>Jan. 1, 1993</DATE>. Most states are banding
with others in regional disposal compacts.
   Nebraska voted against hosting the <ORGANIZATION>Central Interstate Compact</ORGANIZATION>
dump, but was outvoted by <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION>,
who argued that <LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION> ranked highest in generated waste and
environmental suitability.
   A referendum which would have made <LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION> the first state to
pull out of a compact was defeated by a nearly 2-to-1 margin last
<DATE>November</DATE>. The citizens' group that placed the issue on the ballot
raised only about <MONEY>$25,000</MONEY> to get its message across, compared to the
<MONEY>$1.5 million</MONEY> spent to defeat the measure by the utility industry.
   Political analysts believe ads warning that power plants could be
shut down and hospitals might cut back radiological treatments if
the initiative passed prompted many ambivalent voters to keep the
compact.
   When Initiative 402 was rejected, <ORGANIZATION>US Ecology, Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, the company
chosen in <DATE>1987</DATE> by the compact to find a site and build and operate
the dump, forged ahead. The <LOCATION>Louisville</LOCATION>, Ky.-based firm disposed of
nearly half the nation's commercial low-level radioactive waste in
<DATE>1987</DATE>.
   But <ORGANIZATION>US Ecology</ORGANIZATION>'s track record is a major cause of concern to
<LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION>'s dump opponents because two of its now-closed low-level
radioactive waste sites leak.
   Vice President <PERSON>Richard Paton</PERSON> vows <ORGANIZATION>US Ecology</ORGANIZATION> is committed to
building a state-of-the-art dump in <LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION> on a site that will
meet or exceed public health and safety requirements.
   ``No one can make guarantees about the future,'' said a <ORGANIZATION>US
Ecology</ORGANIZATION> handbook distributed to Nebraskans, ``but through the
judicious selection of a site that meets or exceeds the siting
standards, and the concept of multiple engineered barriers built
into our design, the situation that occurred at below-ground
disposal facilities built in the <DATE>1960s</DATE> are very unlikely to occur at
the <LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION> facility.''
   The compact commission delegated siting to <ORGANIZATION>US Ecology</ORGANIZATION> ``so it
would be decided on technical merit,'' rather than politics, said
<PERSON>Dennis Grams</PERSON>, director of <LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Department of Environmental
Control</ORGANIZATION>, adding that his agency would ensure that <ORGANIZATION>US Ecology</ORGANIZATION> meets
regulations.
   ``This process would have been a lot easier for us if the areas
had been designated by the state or federal government,'' said <ORGANIZATION>US
Ecology</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Paton</PERSON>, ``but I believe the controversy will die down when
we show we are not out there to try and do harm. ...''
   Even so, he acknowleged he's been threatened. One caller warned,
``We'll take you out feet first.''
   In acquiescing to host the radioactive facility, Gov. <PERSON>Orr</PERSON> imposed
10 conditions on the compact commission, including ``assurances that
the developer will not locate the facility in a community without
the community's consent.''
   But faced with a groundswell of opposition in <LOCATION>Boyd County</LOCATION>, a
growing anti-dump coalition in <LOCATION>Nemaha County</LOCATION>, and the potential for
resistance in <LOCATION>Nuckolls County</LOCATION>, the governor said in mid-January
there would be ``a great danger'' in letting voters decide whether
to approve the site in their own county.
   Legislators, she said, will have to define ``what constitutes
support by the people of that area.'' Two bills requiring voter
approval in the county eventually chosen for the site are pending in
the Legislature.
   US Ecology estimates it will be 12 to 18 months before a final
dump site is picked. Opponents promise to fight on.
   <PERSON>Hugh Kaufman</PERSON>, a government whistleblower who's currently
assistant to the director of the hazardous waste site control
division of the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Environmental Protection Agency</ORGANIZATION>, spoke as a
private citizen during a meeting in <LOCATION>Nemaha County</LOCATION>.
   ``This region of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> is being singled out as the
new major dumping area for <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON>Kaufman</PERSON>. ``The nuclear
and toxic waste industry is looking around for more naive
governments and officials who don't know how to deal with it.''
   <PERSON>Lowell Fisher</PERSON> believes all three <LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION> counties were picked as
potential sites ``because we're rural and sparsely populated, have
low incomes, are mostly above middle age, politically conservative,
free market-oriented, have a high school education or less, and
staunchly patriotic.''
   ``But we're not stupid,'' added <PERSON>Fisher</PERSON>, surrounded by anti-dump
paperwork scattered on the kitchen table of his farmhouse. ``We've
got a lawyer, we're raising money, and we're getting smarter every
day.''

   In acquiescing to host the radioactive facility, Gov. <PERSON>Orr</PERSON> imposed
10 conditions on the compact commission, including ``assurances that
the developer will not locate the facility in a community without
the community's consent.''
   But faced with a groundswell of opposition in <LOCATION>Boyd County</LOCATION>, a
growing anti-dump coalition in <LOCATION>Nemaha County</LOCATION>, and the potential for
resistance in <LOCATION>Nuckolls County</LOCATION>, the governor said in mid-January
there would be ``a great danger'' in letting voters decide whether
to approve the site in their own county.
   Legislators, she said, will have to define ``what constitutes
support by the people of that area.'' Two bills requiring voter
approval in the county eventually chosen for the site are pending in
the Legislature.
   US Ecology estimates it will be 12 to 18 months before a final
dump site is picked. Opponents promise to fight on.
   <PERSON>Hugh Kaufman</PERSON>, a government whistleblower who's currently
assistant to the director of the hazardous waste site control
division of the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Environmental Protection Agency</ORGANIZATION>, spoke as a
private citizen during a meeting in <LOCATION>Nemaha County</LOCATION>.
   ``This region of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> is being singled out as the
new major dumping area for <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON>Kaufman</PERSON>. ``The nuclear
and toxic waste industry is looking around for more naive
governments and officials who don't know how to deal with it.''
   <PERSON>Lowell Fisher</PERSON> believes all three <LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION> counties were picked as
potential sites ``because we're rural and sparsely populated, have
low incomes, are mostly above middle age, politically conservative,
free market-oriented, have a high school education or less, and
staunchly patriotic.''
   ``But we're not stupid,'' added <PERSON>Fisher</PERSON>, surrounded by anti-dump
paperwork scattered on the kitchen table of his farmhouse. ``We've
got a lawyer, we're raising money, and we're getting smarter every
day.''

<HEAD>Study Projects Little Change from Census Adjustments</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new study concludes that skewing the <ORGANIZATION>Census
Bureau</ORGANIZATION>'s national headcount, as has been proposed in various forms
by lawmakers and special interest groups, would make little
difference in the allocation of <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> seats.
   Population shifts since <DATE>1980</DATE> are expected to result in the shift
of 18 or more seats, various experts agree.
   But even combining the various suggested adjustments would shift
a maximum of just four additional seats among <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION>, population analyst <PERSON>William P.
O'Hare</PERSON> reports.
   ``It appears that none of the adjustments to Census figures that
are being urged upon the bureau are likely to make a big difference
in the overall apportionment of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>,'' O'Hare reported in the
latest issue of ``Population Today,'' the newsletter of the private
<ORGANIZATION>Population Reference Bureau</ORGANIZATION>.
   The census, taken every 10 years, is required by the
Constitution to redistribute the 435 <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> seats, keeping them
relatively even in population. Because the number of <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> members
is limited, whenever a state gains a seat, another state must lose
one.
   Last year the <ORGANIZATION>Commerce Department</ORGANIZATION>, which oversees the <ORGANIZATION>Census
Bureau</ORGANIZATION>, decreed that the <DATE>1990</DATE> results would not be adjusted.
Various interest groups, however, continue to push the idea.
Several lawsuits and congressional bills have been filed seeking to
force changes.
   The main dispute over adjusting the count centers on either
increasing the totals to add minorities presumed to have been
missed or reducing the total to subtract illegal aliens or people
who are ``imputed.''
   Imputed people are those counted despite the fact that Census
officials do not actually contact them. For example, when neighbors
say someone lives at a house even though the census taker
repeatedly cannot locate those people, that person is counted.
   The suit contending minorities are undercounted was filed in
<ORGANIZATION>U.S. District Court</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Brooklyn</LOCATION> by <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>; <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>; <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>;
<LOCATION>Dade County</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla.</LOCATION>; the <ORGANIZATION>NAACP</ORGANIZATION> and groups representing Hispanics and
the nation's mayors.
   A separate suit, seeking to remove the effect of illegal aliens,
was filed in <ORGANIZATION>U.S. District Court</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION> by the <ORGANIZATION>Immigration
Reform Law Institute</ORGANIZATION> on behalf of 42 members of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>,
<LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION> and the Federation for <ORGANIZATION>American
Immigration Reform</ORGANIZATION>.
   An analysis of the <DATE>1980</DATE> census concluded that more than <PERCENT>5
percent</PERCENT> of blacks and Hispanics were missed, considerably more than
the number of whites who were said to have been uncounted. Thus,
interest groups have urged increasing the minority count in each
state by a predetermined percentage.
   Such a move would be expected to benefit states with large
minority populations, but <LOCATION>O'Hare</LOCATION>'s calculations said that would not
be the case.
   ``Interestingly,'' concluded <LOCATION>O'Hare</LOCATION>, ``minority undercount
adjustment, the modification of the census figures which has
received the most attention, would not result in the movement of
any seats between states.''
   On the other hand, he calculated that eliminating illegal aliens
from the count would result in the transfer of one <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> seat from
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>.
   ``This is not surprising when you realize that the <DATE>1980</DATE> census
figures for <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> included an estimated 1 million illegal
aliens,'' O'Hare commented. Taking them out of the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>
population would cost that state a <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> seat; <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> would
be next in line for that seat.
   Some states are more difficult to count and thus have more
imputed people than others, <LOCATION>O'Hare</LOCATION> found. He estimated that
subtracting imputed people from the count would cost <LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION> a
seat. Once again, the gainer would be <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>.
   O'Hare also calculated the results of various combinations of
these adjustments:
   _Adding in allegedly uncounted minorities and subtracting
estimated illegal aliens would move one seat from <LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION> to
<LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>.
   _Adding in minorities and subtracting the imputed people would
transfer seats from <LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION>.
   _Subtracting both illegal aliens and imputed people would move
one <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> seat from <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>.
   _Making all three adjustments would move one seat from
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>.
   The various changes calculated by O'Hare would be in addition to
reallocartions of <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> seats caused by discernable shifts in
population since <DATE>1980</DATE>.
   While the exact shifts won't be known until after the census,
the <ORGANIZATION>Population Reference Bureau</ORGANIZATION> and the private <ORGANIZATION>Election Data
Service</ORGANIZATION> have projected changes based on recent <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION>
population estimates.
   Both groups anticipate the shift of 18 seats from northern
states to the South and West, mirroring the flow of population.
   Gainers are expected to be: <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, 5; <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, 4; <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, 3;
<LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>, 2; <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION>, 2; <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION>, 1 and <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION>, 1.
   Expected to lose seats are: <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, 3; <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>, 3;
<LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>, 2; <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>, 2; <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, 2; <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>, 1; <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION>, 1;
<LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION>, 1; <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>, 1; <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION>, 1, and <LOCATION>Wisconsin</LOCATION>, 1.

<HEAD>Democrats Mobilizing to Protest Preliminary Census Figures</HEAD>

   Democrats are mobilizing local officials to
protest preliminary census figures and pressure the government to
take another look at the count for the nation's cities and rural
areas.
   ``I don't believe it,'' <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON>Mario Cuomo</PERSON> said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>
when the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> estimated that his state's population grew
by fewer than 70,000 during the past decade.
   ``Way out of line,'' <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON>Maynard Jackson</PERSON> said of the
estimate for his city.
   An analysis done for Democratic state legislators said the
preliminary figures for rural areas, particularly in the <LOCATION>South</LOCATION>,
were consistently below the population estimates issued by the
<ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>February</DATE>.
   With the release of numbers for <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>
and <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> completed its estimate of the
population for all 50 states.
   Overall, the preliminary census figures show the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>
with a population of 245,837,683. Ten years ago, the census set the
nation's population at 226,545,805.
   To no one's surprise, the numbers showed Americans continued to
move <LOCATION>South and West</LOCATION> during the past 10 years.
   Nineteen <ORGANIZATION>U.S. House</ORGANIZATION> seats will follow that population shift to
the Sun Belt.
   That trend was good news for Republicans, who consider the Sun
Belt the area of their strongest growth. But a similar trend in the
<DATE>1980</DATE> Census, when 17 <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> seats shifted South and West, failed to
yield expected <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> gains because most of the state legislators who
drew the new district lines were Democrats.
   The big winner when the shift takes place in time for the <DATE>1992</DATE>
election will be <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, which is expected to gain seven new
<ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> seats for a total of 52. With a population expected to push
close to 30 million, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> would have 21 more <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> seats than
the second-largest state, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>.
   Based on the preliminary population figures, <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> would gain
four <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> seats and <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> three. Picking up one each would be
<LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>.
   <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> would lose three <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> seats and <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION> two each. Losing one seat each would be <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION>.
   Officials who think the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> missed a lot of people in
their areas have 15 working days to submit information to support
claims they were undercounted.
   Mayor <PERSON>David Dinkins</PERSON> of <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> called the estimate that his
city lost 40,000 people ``unadulterated nonsense'' and pledged to
``comb through the bureau's data to locate those areas where the
count is too low, identifying housing units the bureau overlooked
and buildings it missed entirely.''
   ``Do you really honestly believe everybody who should be counted
was counted?'' Cuomo asked. Answering his own question, the
governor said, ``Of course not. My mother had trouble. She didn't
want to answer.''
   Rep. <PERSON>Vic Fazio</PERSON> of <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>House Democratic</ORGANIZATION>
group monitoring reapportionment, urged local officials to
challenge the preliminary figures.
   ``Now is not the time to be ringing partisan alarm bells,'' said
<PERSON>Fazio</PERSON>. ``But when a Republican administration is on a track leading
us to a less than fair and accurate census count, Democrats must
challenge at every opportunity available.''
   <PERSON>Kimball Brace</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Election Data Services</ORGANIZATION>, a consulting
firm that analyzes census data for Democratic state legislators,
told a news conference that the figures were subject to
considerable adjustment before the government comes out with final
numbers on <DATE>Dec. 31</DATE>. Even then, the <ORGANIZATION>Commerce Department</ORGANIZATION> will have
until <DATE>July 15, 1991</DATE>, to determine whether to adjust for an
undercount.
   Brace said he understood the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> has found up to 4
million additional people but has not yet included them in the
state figures. He said no estimate was available on where those
people are distributed among the states.
   Brace cited <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Tennessee</LOCATION> as states where
figures for rural areas were well below earlier estimates.

<HEAD>With the House At Stake, Computers and Lawyers Are Ready for Redistricting</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Armed with batteries of computers and brigades
of lawyers, Republicans and Democrats are skirmishing for control
of the political shakeup that offers the <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> its once-in-a-decade
opportunity to dent Democratic control of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``If we want to be competitive in the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION>, we have to get a
good shake on redistricting,'' said <PERSON>Charles Black</PERSON>, the political
consultant who is chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>Republican National Committee</ORGANIZATION>'s
advisory committee on redistricting.
   ``Right now, given the strength of incumbency, there are only
two times you get a chance to pick up any congressional seats,'' he
said. ``One is when the seats are open, and two is when you redraw
the lines.''
   For Republicans, redistricting is a chance to break out of their
depressing status as a seemingly permanent minority in the <ORGANIZATION>U.S.
House</ORGANIZATION>.
   Democrats control the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> by a margin of 260 to 175. While
voters in recent presidential elections have preferred Republican
candidates by landslide margins, Democrats now hold 18 more <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION>
seats than they did when <PERSON>Ronald Reagan</PERSON> was inaugurated in <DATE>1981</DATE>.
   Democrats claim the capital's political split personality comes
from voters' desire to have <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> act as a balance to <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION>
presidents. Republicans claim the split is rooted the Democrats'
drawing the lines for most current congressional districts.
   Redistricting is the once-a-decade reshuffling of the nation's
congressional districts. It is a three-pronged battle _ technical,
political, and legal.
   Every 10 years, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Census counts everyone living in the
country. This time, the day for the count is <DATE>April 1, 1990</DATE>.
   For politicians, the most important Census information is not
how many Americans there are, but where they live. For while the
population increases, the size of the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. House</ORGANIZATION> remains at 435
voting members.
   By <DATE>Dec. 31, 1990</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> will announce each state's
population. And the bureau will reveal the reapportionment of the
<ORGANIZATION>U.S. House</ORGANIZATION> _ the number of representatives for each state, based on
a complicated mathematical formula.
   Then comes redistricting at the state level _ redrawing the
boundaries of congressional districts to fit the new population.
   Gone are the days when cigar-chomping politicians matched up
Census data with voting lists and redrew lines to help their
friends and punish their enemies.
   They're still helping their friends and punishing their enemies,
but now the politicians do it with computers that produce highly
sophisticated plans to can do in a legislator with subtle shifts of
city blocks.
   But computers have little value to politicians who don't have
the votes to get their plan adopted.
   The two parties are considered on a par technologically, but the
Democrats control 28 state legislatures, while Republicans have
only 8. In 13 states Republicans control one legislative chamber
and Democrats the other. <LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION> has a unicameral nonpartisan
legislature.
   The other key players are governors _ 28 are Democrats, while 22
are Republicans.
   Elections this year and next will determine who controls
redistricting. In the states expected to gain or lose the most
seats, neither party is in control, promising fierce battles for
governor and legislative seats.
   The <DATE>1990</DATE> Census will certify the shift to the Sunbelt that will
have <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> speaking with a decidedly more <ORGANIZATION>Southern and Western</ORGANIZATION>
accent. Based on current estimates, 17 <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> seats will head South
and <LOCATION>West</LOCATION>.
   <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> will be the big winner, gaining six seats with an
outside chance of picking up seven. With 45 members in the current
<ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> already has by far the largest congressional
delegation.
   Other winners are <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, expected to gain four <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> seats,
and <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, likely to pick up three. Likely to gain one each are
<LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION>.
   The losers are a familiar lineup _ mostly Northern industrial
states that have seen their congressional representation erode in
recent decades.
   If current trends hold, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> will lose three seats and
<LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION> two each. Losing one each
would be <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Wisconsin</LOCATION>.
   With redistricting clout in the balance, the high-profile races
for governor are in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION> _ all
of which are now in <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> hands. But <PERSON>George Deukmejian</PERSON> of <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>
and <PERSON>Bill Clements</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> are not running for re-election and <PERSON>Bob
Martinez</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> is regarded as vulnerable. <PERSON>Jim Thompson</PERSON> of
<LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION> hasn't announced yet whether he will seek a fifth term as
governor.
   In addition, the battle for control will be fought in countless
legislative contests.
   For example, in <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>, Democrats would control the process if
they capture the state senate where Republicans have a narrow
majority. In <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>, Republicans control one chamber by four
seats and Democrats the other by three.
   After the politicians draw the district lines, the battle will
move to another arena, the courts.
   At some point in the <DATE>1980</DATE> process, redistricting plans in all
but three states ended up in court, says <PERSON>Kimball Brace</PERSON>, president
of <ORGANIZATION>Election Data Services</ORGANIZATION>, a consulting firm that works on
redistricting for Democrats.
   Thus Republicans and Democrats are recruiting teams of lawyers
to defend their plans or attack the opposition's in federal and
state courts.
   The guiding legal principle stems from the <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION>'s ``one
man, one vote'' ruling that mandated that legislative districts be
substantially equal in population.
   Brace cited a <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> plan that ended up in court. Republicans
offered a plan with congressional districts differing in population
by no more than four people. But the court ruled in favor of the
Democrats' plan which was drawn with each district identical in
population.
   How long do districts remain identical in population? Probably
not more than a day or two after the Census is taken.

<HEAD>Nation's Median Age Heading Upward</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thirty-nine, that magic age teetering between
youth and maturity, will be the most typical age for Americans early
in the next century, according to <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> projections.
   Historically a nation of youthful orientation, the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>
is now thirty-something, heading upward, the <ORGANIZATION>Bureau</ORGANIZATION> reports.
   Combining to increase the median age of the population are the
maturing of the massive post World War II Baby Boom and that
generation's relatively low birth rates, which reduce the number of
babies to pull down the numbers.
   So if present trends continue, census officials expect that half
of all Americans will be over the age of 39 by the year <DATE>2010</DATE>, and
half younger. The agency's most recent estimate of median age was
31.7, as of <DATE>1986</DATE>.
   Whether America will plateau at 39 _ as did the late comedian
<PERSON>Jack Benny</PERSON> _ remains to be seen.
   The median age of the country touched 30 for the first time in
<DATE>1950</DATE>, then slipped back as the Baby Boom produced a bouncing crop of
youngsters to lower the numbers.
   It took until the <DATE>1980</DATE> census to hit 30 again, edged up to 31.7
as of <DATE>1986</DATE> and is expected to climb to 33 by <DATE>1990</DATE>, 36.5 by <DATE>2000</DATE> and
39 by the year 2010, according to the new projections from the
<ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION>.
   Despite the aging of the population, however, the report
anticipates that the so-called dependency ratio will decline.
   That ratio is the number of people under 18 and over 65 compared
to the number of people of working age in between. The younger and
older groups are most likely to ``depend'' on those working.
   The <DATE>1986</DATE> ratio of 62.2 dependents per 100 workers is expected to
slip to 56.7 by the year 2010, with the low birth rate reducing the
number of young dependents to a greater extent than aging adds to
the older group.
   While there have been reports of increases in the total number of
births in the last few years, that is because the giant Baby Boom
generation is largely in its prime childbearing years. The rate of
births per 1,000 remains well below that of the post-World War II
period.
   The new census study also estimates that the nation's black
population will increase to <PERCENT>13.7 percent</PERCENT> by <DATE>2010</DATE>. Blacks made up
<PERCENT>11.8 percent</PERCENT> of the population in the <DATE>1980</DATE> census.
   Nearly one in five <ORGANIZATION>Southerners</ORGANIZATION> will be black in <DATE>2010</DATE>, <PERCENT>19.7
percent</PERCENT> of the population. That will be up from <PERCENT>18.7 percent</PERCENT> in <DATE>1980</DATE>.
   In the <ORGANIZATION>Northeast</ORGANIZATION>, blacks will increase from <PERCENT>10.1 percent</PERCENT> to <PERCENT>13.2
percent</PERCENT>. They will go from <PERCENT>9.1 percent</PERCENT> to <PERCENT>11.9 percent</PERCENT> in the
<LOCATION>Midwest</LOCATION> and from <PERCENT>5.3 percent</PERCENT> to <PERCENT>6.3 percent</PERCENT> in the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION>.
   The projections show the <ORGANIZATION>Northeast</ORGANIZATION> remaining the oldest section
of the country, with the median age for that region increasing from
33.6 in <DATE>1986</DATE> to 40.3 in <DATE>2010</DATE>.
   The South will be second in <DATE>2010</DATE> at a median age of 38.4, up from
31.4 in <DATE>1986</DATE>. The <ORGANIZATION>Midwest</ORGANIZATION> will mature from 31.6 to 38.8 and the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION>
will go from 31.0 to 37.4.
   <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> will remain the state with the highest median age and
<LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION> will still be the youngest state, according to the projections.
   <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, with a median age of 36.0 in <DATE>1986</DATE>, will age to 45.3.
Utah's median will rise from 25.5 to 27.6, leaving it the only state
with a median age below 30 years, thanks largely to a continuing
high birth rate.
   In the <DATE>1986</DATE> estimates no state had a median over 40 but several
were under 30, including _ besides <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION> _ <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New Mexico</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION>.
   In <DATE>2010</DATE> not only <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> will have topped 40. Other states with
median ages above that milestone will include <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Oregon</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Rhode Island</LOCATION>,

      High-School Enrollment
   Has Its <ORGANIZATION>Ups</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Downs
   WEST VIRGINIA</ORGANIZATION> might consider adding the high school student to its list of endangered species. 
A survey released this month of projected enrollments estimates that the state's high schools will graduate nearly a third fewer students by the year <DATE>2004</DATE>. 

   High-school enrollment nationwide has been on a roller-coaster ride, giving school planners fits. 
The number of high-school graduates peaked in <DATE>1979</DATE>, declined through the mid-1980s, and turned up slightly the past couple of years. 
Another major slump is expected in <DATE>1989</DATE> but will bottom out in the mid-1990s and then recover strongly just past the year <DATE>2000</DATE>. 
The ups and downs reflect fluctuations in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> birth rate and the influx of immigrant groups who favor large families. 

   The study by the <ORGANIZATION>Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Boulder</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Colo.</LOCATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION>College Board</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, relies on population trends but doesn't try to forecast state economic conditions, which can cause sharp population swings. 

   The study says <LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION>'s high-school graduates will more than double by <DATE>2004</DATE>. 
Graduates in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> will increase by nearly two-thirds. 
<LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION> face sharply fewer graduates.

   If You Can't Beat Them,
   Change the Rules
   <LOCATION>CARBONDALE</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>ILL.</LOCATION>, news paper publisher <PERSON>W. Stephen Burgess</PERSON> says: "If you aren't in those books, you don't exist."
   He's speaking of the bibles of the advertising, media and sales industries -- such as Newspaper Rates and Data, and Survey of Buying Power -- that list income and demographic data for metropolitan areas. Because <LOCATION>Carbondale</LOCATION> doesn't meet the complex federal definition of a metro area, it isn't on these lists. And as a result, <PERSON>Mr. Burgess</PERSON> says, his newspaper, the <ORGANIZATION>Southern Illinoisan</ORGANIZATION>, has a tough time catching the attention of national advertisers.
   The solution? Become a metro area by act of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>. At the behest of the city's boosters, Rep. <PERSON>Kenneth Gray</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Ill.</LOCATION>) introduced a bill naming the county that includes <LOCATION>Carbondale</LOCATION> and two adjacent counties as one Metropolitan Statistical Area. Though <LOCATION>Carbondale</LOCATION> has just 26,000 residents -- including 12,000 <ORGANIZATION>Southern Illinois University</ORGANIZATION> students -- the combined counties have more than 100,000 residents, one of the benchmarks of a metro area.
   Two other areas, <LOCATION>Harvey County</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kan.</LOCATION>, and a two-county region including <LOCATION>Decatur</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ala.</LOCATION>, have achieved the status by congressional fiat since <DATE>1986</DATE>. The tinkering disturbs statisticians, though, who say it makes all metro area figures suspect.
   If the <LOCATION>Carbondale</LOCATION> bill is approved, it could be a shallow victory. Survey of Buying Power, a widely used sales and media guide, will stop listing metro areas that don't meet the government's traditional definition. "We're seeing statistics used in an improper way for private gain. It's a subtle form of pork barrel," says <PERSON>Edward Spar</PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION>Bill Communications</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, the survey's publisher.
   Census Won't List
   Various Asian Groups
   <LOCATION>CALIFORNIA</LOCATION> congressman <PERSON>Robert Matsui</PERSON> appears to have lost a battle with the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> over how the nation's fast-growing Asian population will be counted.
   Rep. <PERSON>Matsui</PERSON> wants the <DATE>1990</DATE> census form's question on racial identity to contain a list of at least 11 Asian groups: Japanese, Korean, <LOCATION>Hawaiian</LOCATION>, Chinese and Samoan, for instance. Ethnic Asians would be asked to check one of the categories, or an additional line marked "other." A similar question was on the <DATE>1980</DATE> census.
   But the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION>, citing space problems, has decided on a single fill-in-the-blank question, requiring Asians and <ORGANIZATION>Pacific Islanders</ORGANIZATION> to write in their ethnic identification. <PERSON>Paula Schneider</PERSON>, chief of the bureau's population division, says that in several field tests the write-in question resulted in more accurate data than the check-off method. Rep. <PERSON>Matsui</PERSON>, however, says many immigrants with poor English skills won't fill in the blank correctly.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Office of Management and Budget</ORGANIZATION> -- which has final say on census matters, barring congressional override -- is expected to side with the bureau.
   As a compromise, though, <PERSON>Ms. Schneider</PERSON> says the <DATE>1990</DATE> census will include far more detailed information on Asian groups than previous censuses, and the figures will be rushed out by the <DATE>spring of 1991</DATE>. After the <DATE>1980</DATE> census, it took until the mid-1980s before all the data on Asians were released.
   Odds and Ends
   SUN BELT inflation: <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>'s purchasing managers report that the rate of price increases last month was the state's second highest for any month in the past seven years. . . . So far this year, the <ORGANIZATION>Centers for Disease Control</ORGANIZATION> has identified 192 animal rabies cases in <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Maryland</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> -- making it the region with the highest incidence of rabies in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> . . . High-density bureaucrats: <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION> have more than 600 federal, state and local government employees per 10,000 population, the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> says.

<HEAD>Ice Makes Midwest a Skating Rink, Snow Still Immobilizes Part of
Wyoming</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROGER PETTERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A storm that staggered the Rockies with snow sealed parts of the
<LOCATION>Midwest</LOCATION> inside a thick layer of ice <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, pulling down power
lines that served more than 90,000 customers in <LOCATION>Des Moines</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>,
and turning roads into skating rinks.
   Some major <LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION> highways remained closed a third day by deep
snow, idling travelers in motels, restaurants, truck stops and
shelters, although temperatures rose above freezing.
   Hundreds of schools were closed because ice or snow made travel
hazardous, or because of lack of electricity.
   South of the snow and ice belt, up to 7 inches of rain fell
overnight and flooded parts of <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION>, forcing evacuation of some
homes in Little Rock. A school bus was swept off a flooded road and
into a ditch; its young passengers were evacuated without injury by
boat.
   But the rain also soaked into drought-parched fields in southern
<LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION>.
   Freezing rain during the night brought down tree branches and
power lines across wide sections of <LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>South Dakota</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Wisconsin</LOCATION>.
   <LOCATION>Des Moines</LOCATION> was hardest hit, with nearly <PERCENT>60 percent</PERCENT> of customers
in the metropolitan area blacked out. Police said nearly every
street in the city was closed or partially closed at some point by
downed lines or fallen limbs.
   Des Moines received more than 2 inches of precipitation in the
<TIME>24 hours before 6 a.m.</TIME>, and state Climatologist <PERSON>Harry Hillaker</PERSON>
estimated that about half of it was frozen rain.
   ``I stepped outside last night in a safe place, no power lines
or trees nearby, just to hear all the trees snapping off,''
<PERSON>Hillaker</PERSON> said. ``I thought, `I've got to experience this. It may
not be like this ever again.''' He said he took his 7-year-old
daughter along but she became frightened within a minute.
   A utility company spokesman said people without service should
expect another night in the dark and that some areas might not have
service until <DATE>Sunday</DATE>.
   <LOCATION>Des Moines</LOCATION> schools closed for the first time <DATE>this winter</DATE>, as did
schools and day cares in most suburbs. <ORGANIZATION>Drake University</ORGANIZATION> called off
classes when the campus lost all power <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>.
   ``We've got 1,700 kids living on campus with no electricity or
phones,'' said university spokesman <PERSON>Gary Bonnett</PERSON>. ``Imagine the
food problems. This morning they fed 'em cereal and bananas.''
   <ORGANIZATION>Iowa Power</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>John McCarroll</PERSON> said at least 90,000
customers did not have service by <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME>, but president
<PERSON>Lynn Vorbrich</PERSON> said that number was trimmed to 75,000 by mid-day.
   Other utilities across the state reported scattered outages, as
did utilities in <LOCATION>South Dakota</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION>.
   Gov. <PERSON>Terry Branstad</PERSON> declared 11 central <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION> counties disaster
areas, making them eligible for <ORGANIZATION>National Guard and Transportation
Department</ORGANIZATION> assistance.
   <LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION> hospitals reported treating several people who had
fallen on slippery sidewalks. In northeastern <LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION>, a pileup
involving 20 to 30 vehicles forced the temporary closing of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
169 near <LOCATION>Calumet</LOCATION>.
   WCCO-AM in <LOCATION>Minneapolis</LOCATION>, whose signal covers much of the upper
<LOCATION>Midwest</LOCATION> and on many winter mornings broadcasts lists of school
closings, said it received reports of nearly 160 closings <DATE>Thursday</DATE>
in <LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION>, and more in western <LOCATION>Wisconsin</LOCATION>.
   Temperatures leaped above freezing <DATE>Thursday</DATE> across the
southeastern quarter of <LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION>, largely shut down since the storm
dumped heavy snow <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, with 19 inches at the capital, <LOCATION>Cheyenne</LOCATION>.
But about 220 miles of interstate highways remained closed for the
third straight day.
   The <LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION> highway patrol opened one westbound lane of
Interstate 80 from <LOCATION>Cheyenne</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Laramie</LOCATION> at mid-morning. But
dispatcher <PERSON>Gary Gonzalez</PERSON> couldn't offer a guess on when the rest of
I-80 might be reopened between <LOCATION>Cheyenne</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Laramie</LOCATION> or I-25 from
<LOCATION>Cheyenne</LOCATION> north to <LOCATION>Wheatland</LOCATION>.
   At <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION>, officials of the <ORGANIZATION>Regional Transportation District</ORGANIZATION>
said the public transit system was back on a full schedule. Many
schools in northern <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION> remained closed.
   <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> 287 north of <LOCATION>Fort Collins</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Colo.</LOCATION>, to the <LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION> line
reopened <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, the last major northern <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION> highway to
remain closed after the blizzard dumped more than 4 feet of snow on
some parts of the <ORGANIZATION>Front Range</ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Census Bureau Takes Pride in Keeping Answers Confidential</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pssst, can you keep a secret? The <ORGANIZATION>Census
Bureau</ORGANIZATION> can.
   The same people who churn out a seemingly endless supply of
details about Americans in general, will reveal nothing about
individuals.
   Urging people to answer the census, Bureau Director <PERSON>Barbara E.
Bryant</PERSON> stresses their responses are ``completely confidential.''
   ``The answers are not shared with any other government agency or
individual. They are combined into statistics, with individual
information kept private until the year <DATE>2062</DATE>,'' she says.
   Confidentiality was not always the rule. Two centuries ago
copies of the census lists were posted in public places so people
could point out omissions and errors.
   But today individual privacy is both policy and law. And the
<ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> has compiled an enviable record of protecting the
information people provide.
   For example, even during the hysteria following the bombing of
<LOCATION>Pearl Harbor</LOCATION> in <DATE>1941</DATE>, the bureau refused to release the names and
addresses of Japanese-Americans living on the <LOCATION>West Coast</LOCATION>.
   It also turned down the attorney general's demand for
information about individuals suspected of being communists during
a Red Scare in <DATE>1947</DATE>.
   And in <DATE>1980</DATE> the bureau refused to comply with a federal court
order demanding addresses for certain city officials.
   In turning down the court, bureau officials said even releasing
information on the number of people living in various apartments
could harm individuals by revealing those doubling-up or by
disclosing the presence of squatters, welfare fathers, illegal
aliens and others.
   Confidentiality is especially stressed in promotion efforts
directed at the Hispanic community, where many people may be in the
country illegally, and those who are legal often distrust
government officials.
   The law requires the bureau to count all the people in the
nation, not just citizens. So it makes a special effort to reach
those who are reluctant to be included.
   Hence the emphasis that information given the census is not
passed on to the <ORGANIZATION>Immigration and Naturalization Service</ORGANIZATION>, or the
<ORGANIZATION>Internal Revenue Service</ORGANIZATION>, or the <ORGANIZATION>Selective Service</ORGANIZATION>, or anyone else.
   Names and addresses of individuals are collected to make sure no
one is missed or counted twice. But they are not recorded in the
giant computers which compile and sort the census information,
officials say.
   Those machines merely digest the information about people living
on particular blocks or census tracts across the nation, and
provide that information for a variety of statistical uses.
   In cases where even releasing those statistics would reveal
something about an individual, the numbers are kept private.
   For example, the <DATE>1980</DATE> Census found 2,315 people living in Census
Tract 20 of <LOCATION>Kansas City</LOCATION>, including one black person.
   Normally data such as income, type of residence, employment and
so forth is released by race.
   But not in this tract, because it would have been obvious who
was being reported on. Indeed, the bureau suppresses data unless a
large number of people are averaged out, so that no one can learn
about an individual or family or small group.
   Census Bureau employees who reveal information about individuals
are subject to a <MONEY>$5,000</MONEY> fine and five years in prison. But no one
has ever been convicted of releasing such data.
   Only after 72 years does the information on individuals become
public record. Then it is made available at the National Archives
for people doing research on their ancestors. That means individual
data from the <DATE>1920</DATE> census will become available in two years.
   The only use of census data permitted earlier is for individuals
who request information to prove their age. This often is needed to
qualify for pension benefits or for some other purpose when birth
certificates or other documents have been lost.
   The legal confidentiality of the census was instituted in <DATE>1910</DATE>
to protect information on businesses, and in <DATE>1930</DATE> that was extended
to cover the general population.
   Privacy was apparently not a consideration in <DATE>1790</DATE>, when the
first <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> census was taken. The <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Marshals</ORGANIZATION> who took that census
posted their lists in public, a practice that continued until <DATE>1830</DATE>.

<HL> REGIONS:
Census Debate: Is an Estimate
More Accurate Than a Count?

   LOOK AHEAD three years to the <DATE>summer of 1990</DATE>. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> has just finished its 10-year national head count, and officials there are worried. 
The bureau has run the most expensive, well-publicized census operation in history. 
It has mailed more than 100 million census forms and knocked on millions of house and apartment doors. 
But as in past censuses, bureau officials know that several million Americans somehow eluded the enumerators and went uncounted. 

   Now here's the rub. 
The bureau thinks it can figure out how many people it missed, and even where these people live. 
By cross-referencing all sorts of records, and double-checking national censuses with small-scale post-census surveys, bureau officials think they can estimate, with a high degree of accuracy, the extent of the national undercount. 

   What's more, government demographers assume they can come up with accurate totals of people the census missed at the state, county and city level. 
If the formula is really humming, they say it may be possible to produce accurate undercount figures down to the individual city block. 

   With the statistical theory at hand and a mandate to produce the most accurate population picture possible, Census officials wonder if they should take the unprecedented step of adjusting the <DATE>1990</DATE> census totals to reflect these unenumerated Americans. 

   WHICH LEADS to a highly charged question: Should the nation's official decennial population count -- the benchmark for reapportioning the <ORGANIZATION>House of Representatives</ORGANIZATION> and state legislatures, the yardstick for handing out <MONEY>billions of dollars</MONEY> in federal aid, the statistical standard for marketing everything from political candidates to breakfast cereal -- include people that the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> didn't actually count but that the bureau assumes exist? 

   The "adjustment" question is increasingly a hot issue, spreading beyond the rarefied discussion of demographers to city halls, to the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION>, and to <LOCATION>Capitol Hill</LOCATION>. 
<LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> are squaring off against smaller states over the issue. 
Mayors of several big cities, with government aid and possibly representation in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> and in legislatures hanging in the balance, say they'll call in the lawyers if adjustment doesn't go through. 

   The debate widened last week in <LOCATION>Indianapolis</LOCATION> at the annual meeting of the <ORGANIZATION>National Conference of State Legislatures</ORGANIZATION>. 

   "What happens if <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION> loses a congressional seat to <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> based on the modified figures?" asked <PERSON>Thomas Hofeller</PERSON>, director of computer services for the <ORGANIZATION>Republican National Committee</ORGANIZATION>. 
"Imagine the public reaction that fictitious people have been added to units of political geography when there isn't one shred of tangible evidence that those people actually live there." 

   <PERSON>Mr. Hofeller</PERSON> predicted pressure, if the census is adjusted, to also make public the traditional, unadjusted totals. 
Two sets of population figures floating around would confuse nearly everyone, he said, and could injure the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION>'s reputation. 

   REPUBLICANS, as it happens, would suffer the most political damage from an adjusted census. 
That's because blacks and Hispanics, who tend to vote Democratic, make up most of the undercount. 
In <DATE>1980</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> believes it failed to physically find about <PERCENT>5.6%</PERCENT> of the nation's black citizens, at least the same share of Hispanics, and <PERCENT>0.5%</PERCENT> of all whites. 

   That makes adjustment a civil rights question, argued <PERSON>TerriAnn Lowenthal</PERSON>, staff director of a <ORGANIZATION>House of Representatives</ORGANIZATION> census subcommittee. 
"These people aren't being fairly represented in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> under one man, one vote," she told the legislators. 

   <PERSON>Ms. Lowenthal</PERSON> argued, and Census officials agree, that you can't find everyone simply by throwing more money and effort into the initial head count. 
Some people will always escape the census taker. 
Adjustment is "a little scary," <PERSON>Ms. Lowenthal</PERSON> conceded, adding: "We can keep on knowing that people aren't being fairly represented in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>, or we can try to do something about it." 

   THE CENSUS BUREAU is squarely in the middle -- a nonpartisan agency attempting to subtly promote an idea with major political overtones. 

   The bureau says the issue is speed. 
The national census will be held in <DATE>April 1990</DATE>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> requires the bureau to deliver state population totals to the president by <DATE>Dec. 31</DATE>. 
Between those dates, the bureau would have to add up the national numbers, run a post-enumeration survey to determine the undercount, then adjust the totals nationwide, an immensely complex statistical task. 

   "We think we have the technique. 
We don't know if we can do it fast enough in the field," <PERSON>C. Louis Kincannon</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> deputy director, told the legislators. 

   For now, the bureau is trying to educate politicians and others with a stake in adjustment. 
<PERSON>Mr. Kincannon</PERSON> says a go, no-go decision won't come until mid-1990. 

   Meanwhile, political pressure builds. 
The <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> administration is hinting its displeasure. 
"We're concerned about the position the bureau is in," says <PERSON>William Margaritis</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Commerce Department</ORGANIZATION> special assistant. 
<PERSON>Ms. Lowenthal</PERSON> says a bill ordering adjustment will likely be introduced in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> next year. 

   Then there's the courts. 
Fifty-two lawsuits followed the <DATE>1980</DATE> census. 
Half are still pending, including a complaint challenging the accuracy of the unadjusted census in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Kincannon</PERSON> is resigned to a fight. 
"Whatever we do about adjustment is going to result in litigation against us," he says.

   The typical American household, nearly six
members strong when the nation was new, is down statistically to
just over 2{ people, a record low, the <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   The decline reflects ``changes in the age structure of the
American population,'' said <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> demographer <PERSON>Campbell
Gibson</PERSON> in a telephone interview.
   The household is shrinking as families have fewer children, more
young people set up housekeeping on their own and the number of
elderly maintaining their own households grows.
   There were 91.5 million households in the country as of <DATE>last
July 1</DATE>, the bureau said, with an average population of 2.62 people
each.
   That was down from 2.64 people a year earlier and 2.75 people in
the <DATE>1980</DATE> census, as the number of households in the country
continues to grow faster than the population as a whole.
   From <DATE>1980</DATE> to <DATE>1988</DATE>, the number of households increased <PERCENT>13.9
percent</PERCENT>, while the population rose <PERCENT>8.5 percent</PERCENT>.
   Back in <DATE>1790</DATE>, the first national census found that the typical
household contained 5.79 people.
   That was a time of extended families and generations living
together, circumstances which have become less common over time.
   ``More than anything else'' <PERSON>sid Gibson</PERSON>, ``decline in fertility''
has had an impact on household size.
   Between <DATE>1980</DATE> and <DATE>1987</DATE>, the proportion of the total population
under age 18 dropped from <PERCENT>28.1 percent</PERCENT> to <PERCENT>26 percent</PERCENT>, he said.
   The nation's birth rate fell from 18.2 births per 1,000 people
in <DATE>1970</DATE> to 15.6 in <DATE>1987</DATE>.
   In recent years, there has been an increase in the total number
of births, largely a result of the giant Baby Boom generation being
in its prime childbearing years.
   However, this generation is still reproducing at a lower rate
than the parents, resulting in fewer children per household.
   ``Total births are still nowhere near'' what they were in the
decade following World War II, <PERSON>Gibson</PERSON> said.
   This decline in young people is reflected in the maturing of
<LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s population, a change emphasized on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> with a
separate <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> report showing that the nation's median age
has risen to 32.3 years, its highest level ever.
   At the other end, pulling up the age, are members of the
post-World War II Baby Boom generation moving into middle age and
the growing number of elderly Americans whose lives have been
extended by improved medical care.
   With better health, more and more elderly maintain households on
their own, either as couples or alone, rather than living with
children or in group homes for older people or nursing homes.
   For example, in <DATE>1970</DATE> about 5 million people aged 65 and over
lived alone, while by <DATE>1987</DATE> that had risen to 8.5 million.
   In addition, many young people continue to set up housekeeping
on their own rather than forming families as they pursue education
and careers.
   In <DATE>1987</DATE>, there were 6.5 million persons aged 25 to 44 living
alone, compared with just 1.6 million in <DATE>1970</DATE>, census studies show.
   Gibson discounted the effect of the rise in divorce and
separation on household size, however, commenting that detailed
statistics are not available to determine this result.
   For example, a divorced couple may form two smaller households,
may remarry or one or both may go to live with parents or others.
   Family-oriented <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION> was the only state with an average
household size of more than three, at 3.17, the bureau reported.
<LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Oregon</LOCATION> had the smallest average household size at 2.46.
   The household measure counts the number of persons residing in a
single housing unit. This can be a single person living alone or
any number of people sharing the home. The size of a household is
usually slightly smaller than that of a family, since it includes
single people while a family must include at least two related
individuals.
   Here is the average population in American households over the
years:

   Readers may recall that in the mid-1980s, state and local
governments were running budget surpluses that mitigated the
federal deficits. These days, Washington is even deeper in
the red than before, but times are now tough in the provinces
as well. What happened?
   Fundamentally, government at all levels has propelled
spending way ahead of the revenue stream. To maintain a
pretense of restraint, costs are being shifted down to the
next governmental rung. The butt end is now seen, for
example, in the crisis conditions of urban public hospitals.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The statehouses are both victims and villains in this. As
a share of the economy, overall state and local spending
actually is slightly lower than it was in the heyday of
federal "revenue sharing" in the mid-1970s. Indeed, most
states are spending less per dollar of personal income than
they were in <DATE>1979</DATE>. But 17 of them, according to the <ORGANIZATION>Public
Affairs Research Institute of New Jersey</ORGANIZATION>, were by <DATE>1989</DATE>
cutting deeper into their citizens' hides than a decade
before. They are <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Delaware</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New
Jersey</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New Mexico</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>North Dakota</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>
and <LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION>.
   ---
   What is driving the expenditure engine? Two major
categories are blamed: Medicaid and what is laughably
referred to as "corrections," which generally means prisons
and jails. Other programs figure in this, too, depending on
the state.
   The Medicaid explosion is the starkest cost shift of our
time. It is greatly the work of one man, Rep. <PERSON>Henry Waxman</PERSON>
(D., <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>). <PERSON>Mr. Waxman</PERSON> and his congressional allies are in
politics to make more kinds of taxpaid care available to more
people. State governments are along for about half the ride.
Costs tripled during the <DATE>1980s</DATE>.
   <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION> is one of the Medicaid magnets, and the
<ORGANIZATION>Federal Reserve Bank of Boston</ORGANIZATION> recently analyzed the program.
It found "a huge increase in expenditures for the disabled"
-- those deemed mentally retarded or ill. With the homeless
now among the recipients, "the scope for expanding coverage
appears significant." Long-term care for the elderly may be
the next big policy leap for the program.
   Children have become the main political focus of Medicaid
growth lately, and this shows up in the high frequency of
doctor visits by low-income families. Kids are also the
target of nutritional aid under such approaches as the Women,
Infants and Children (WIC) program.
   Many people believe that this kind of effort, along with
prenatal care, yields greater gains than most government
spending, but the scope of the federal-state <ORGANIZATION>WIC</ORGANIZATION> endeavor is
staggering. Provisions range from baby formula (it buys a
third of the nation's supply) to peanut butter. And given
liberal eligibility criteria and bipartisan backing for more
funding, it is a window to universal child feeding by the
public sector in the foreseeable future.
   Some states have gone beyond federal requirements in
doctoring and nurturing. When the last session of the
<LOCATION>Wisconsin Legislature</LOCATION> widened the Medical Assistance program
there to "provide virtually every optional service,"
according to the Governor's Budget in Brief, it set in motion
an expected <PERCENT>40%</PERCENT> increase in state costs over four years and
undid three years of overall spending restraint under
Governor <PERSON>Tommy Thompson</PERSON>. Of course, actual expenditures
normally outrun estimates in social services, particularly in
a slow economy.
   A few states -- <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION> is one -- have mandated
health insurance. Such schemes are sold as a way to lower
public costs but have proved pricey. At the same time, <LOCATION>Oregon</LOCATION>
is drawing attention for trying to ration care to curb
runaway Medicaid.
   ---
   No state has adopted a fix for the costs of imprisonment,
and as more felons are put away, the tab will grow. Less
noticed, however, is that the bill has risen even faster than
the inmate population, despite some success with prison
privatization. Expenses run up when states add special drug
and AIDS programs for today's convicts. And as the <ORGANIZATION>National
Association of State Budget Officers</ORGANIZATION> noted in its current
fiscal overview, a majority of the prison systems are under
some form of costly court mandate.
   In <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, the non-deterrent practices of judges no
doubt has something to do with <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>'s wide lead in costs
of incarceration, but given a pattern of high expense ratios
in that state's functions, you have to suspect part of the
problem is a homegrown culture of publicly funded empathy.
   When it comes to other expenditures of the "justice"
system, you find that policing in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> costs twice the
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> average and that the costs of tax-paid attorneys tend to
be highest in jurisdictions with the most lawyers. So much
for supply-demand curves in that field.
   ---
   Other budget categories may not be 50-state nightmares,
but their costs can be shocking nonetheless. Welfare spending
is rising dramatically in such states as <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>, where new Republican Governors are trying to cut it
back. Maybe they could learn from <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION>, which has its
share of urban problems but has managed in most respects to
maintain leanness in state operations over the years.
   High-payment levels can partly explain welfare surges
among the states, but recession is widespread, and the Family
Support Act that <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> passed in <DATE>1988</DATE> "is likely to demand
increased state support" generally for AFDC mothers, the
budget officers say. As out-of-wedlock births and family
disintegration continue to sweep the land, other social
expenses such as foster-care homes can be expected to shoot
up.
   As with all programs, a distinction should be drawn
between the payments or services actually reaching
beneficiaries and the price of bureaucracy. In AFDC, for
example, the cost per case administered in <DATE>fiscal 1988</DATE> was
almost nine times higher in <LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION> than in <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION>. Now,
you might excuse <LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION> as having a low welfare population
over which to spread the overhead. But how does that explain
the third most expensive state, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, being nearly four
times as costly as <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>?
   Despite much ado about teachers' pay and a nation at risk,
public-school expenditures have not been a bigger part of the
state burden in the <DATE>'80s</DATE>. Dropping enrollment in most
statesCalifornia being a notable exceptionis a major reason.
In fact, college costs have grown faster, though in most
states tuition covers part. It must be noted, though, that
local school systems supported by steadily rising property
taxes are meeting stiff resistance.
   Environmental measures are another way the federal
government triggers higher spending down the line. An <ORGANIZATION>EPA</ORGANIZATION>
study has warned that states can expect a <PERCENT>20%</PERCENT> increase by the
year <DATE>2000</DATE> to meet <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> standards. Other estimates of the cost
for states and localities of complying with the recently
enacted Clean Air Act run between <MONEY>$600 million</MONEY> and <MONEY>$1 billion</MONEY>
each year. Some of those costs will go for hiring enforcement
agents, such as lawyers, accountants and scientists, whose
activities will surely generate costs beyond most budgeted
estimates. The cost to localities also may rise as sewage and
solid-waste concerns mount. In the area of unbudgeted costs,
judges contribute in their role as local overseers and
enforcers, as do politically correct environmental activists
who thwart cost-effective solutions.
   Finally, we come to two gaping catchalls of state
spending: interest payments and what usually ends up as
"other." The debt load incorporates capital projects in many
categories -- all of them, you can bet, at top dollar. Census
Bureau figures show its servicing to have grown twentyfold in
the <DATE>past quarter century</DATE>, faster than any state function
except corrections. "Other" varies depending on what you toss
in, but the pot can be mighty big. The state budget officers
account for more than <PERCENT>35%</PERCENT> of spending in this fashion, and
note that it includes such goodies as "economic development
initiatives."
   ---
   At the end of the day, it becomes obvious that the crunch
in state finances, and in turn those of local governments, is
upon us because smoke and mirrors are no longer available to
distort the picture. As <PERSON>Robert Inman</PERSON>, a public-finance
specialist at the <ORGANIZATION>Wharton School</ORGANIZATION> describes it, <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> grew
accustomed to having the public sector take care -- sometimes
better, sometimes not -- of duties formerly left to personal
responsibility or private institutions. However, that
attitude seemed to change with the decision voters made in
the presidential election of <DATE>1980</DATE>.
   Starting in the early <DATE>1980s</DATE>, <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> determined that it
was no longer able or willing to carry the bulk of the load.
Its subventions to <LOCATION>South Succotash</LOCATION> began to dry up, but an
economic boom through the decade brought in tax revenues and
any reckoning with the underlying implications of the
expanding spending burden was put off. Though federal aid
again is creeping up, the reckoning is now near.
   The people of the united and sovereign states must decide
whether they will tax themselves to new heights or make
choices on the spending side. Increasingly, there is no place

   The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, historically a nation of youthful orientation,
is now thirty-something and heading upward, reports the <ORGANIZATION>Census
Bureau</ORGANIZATION>.
   If present trends continue, census officials expect that half of
all Americans will be over the age of 39 by the year <DATE>2010</DATE>, and half
younger. The agency's most recent estimate of median age was 32.1,
as of last <DATE>July 1</DATE>, the highest ever.
   The 35-44 age group is the fastest-growing segment of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
population, and the population segments aged 85 and over and 75-84
rank second and third in growth since <DATE>1980</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>Bureau</ORGANIZATION> said.
   Combining to increase the median age of the population are the
maturing of the massive post World War II Baby Boom and that
generation's relatively low birth rates, which reduce the number of
babies to pull down the numbers.
   The median age of the country touched 30 for the first time in
<DATE>1950</DATE>, then slipped back as the Baby Boom produced a bouncing crop of
youngsters to lower the numbers.
   It took until the <DATE>1980</DATE> census to hit 30 again, edged up to 31.7
as of <DATE>1986</DATE> and is expected to climb to 33 by <DATE>1990</DATE>, 36.5 by <DATE>2000</DATE> and
39 by the year 2010, according to the new projections from the
<ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION>.
   Despite the aging of the population, however, the report
anticipates that the so-called dependency ratio will decline.
   That ratio is the number of people under 18 and over 65 compared
to the number of people of working age in between. The younger and
older groups are most likely to ``depend'' on those working.
   The <DATE>1986</DATE> ratio of 62.2 dependents per 100 workers is expected to
slip to 56.7 by the year 2010, with the low birth rate reducing the
number of young dependents to a greater extent than aging adds to
the older group.
   While there have been reports of increases in the total number of
births in the last few years, that is because the giant Baby Boom
generation is largely in its prime child-bearing years. The rate of
births per 1,000 remains well below that of the post-World War II
period.
   ``The repercussions of the Baby Boom are many and varied,''
Census Bureau statistician <PERSON>Louisa Miller</PERSON> said. ``They will continue
to affect the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> for many years to come.''
   They are now at the age where they have more discretionary income
and the effect can be seen in the nation's culture and marketing,
she said.
   The generation's arrival spurred a boom in sales of baby
products. It then proceeded to overwhelm the school system,
following up with creation of a national orientation toward teen-age
music and styles.
   Now, as the Baby Boomers set up more and smaller households, they
are prompting a boom in housing sales and household goods, marketing
experts say.
   ``Further down the road, once they begin to reach retirement age,
they will obviously have a great effect on the direction the country
takes,'' <PERSON>Miller</PERSON> added.
   The census projections show the <ORGANIZATION>Northeast</ORGANIZATION> remaining the oldest
section of the country, with the median age for that region
increasing from 33.6 in <DATE>1986</DATE> to 40.3 in <DATE>2010</DATE>.
   The South will be second in <DATE>2010</DATE> at a median age of 38.4, up from
31.4 in <DATE>1986</DATE>. The <ORGANIZATION>Midwest</ORGANIZATION> will mature from 31.6 to 38.8 and the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION>
will go from 31.0 to 37.4.
   <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> will remain the state with the highest median age and
<LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION> will still be the youngest state, according to the projections.
   <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, with a median age of 36.0 in <DATE>1986</DATE>, will age to 45.3.
Utah's median will rise from 25.5 to 27.6, leaving it the only state
with a median age below 30 years, thanks largely to a continuing
high birth rate.
   In the <DATE>1986</DATE> estimates no state had a median over 40 but several
were under 30, including _ besides <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION> _ <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New Mexico</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION>.
   In <DATE>2010</DATE> not only <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> will have topped 40. Other states with
median ages above that milestone will include <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Oregon</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Rhode Island</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Tennessee</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION>.
