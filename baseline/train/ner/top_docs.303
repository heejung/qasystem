<HEAD>Anger Runs Deep In Moslem Community; Vengeance Does Not</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The anger over <PERSON>Salman Rushdie</PERSON> and his novel ``The
Satanic Verses'' is quick to flare and shared by many in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>'s
Moslem community, from the sweetmeats shopkeeper to the Bangladeshi
banker.
   But while they spare no insult for the author they accuse of
blasphemy, many in the city's narrow East End streets don't seek
vengeance and reject <PERSON>Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini</PERSON>'s order to execute
him.
   The Imams and <ORGANIZATION>Mosque council</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> issued an appeal to ``all
imams'' _ Moslem clergymen _ to respect British law.
   An information office representing Prince <PERSON>Reza Pahlavi</PERSON>, son of
the late <PERSON>Shah</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION>, said the Iranian government's reaction
exemplifies the ``brutal and arbitrary intolerance that is rampant
in <LOCATION>Khomeini</LOCATION>'s Islamic Republic.''
   The statement, however, said the prince was sympathetic to
objections to the book.
   In conversations with immigrants in the East End's Brick Lane
shops, some cheered the death call. But many said the author, who
has canceled a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> tour and dropped from sight, should live.
   ``To kill him is not going to solve the problem,'' said <PERSON>Naim
Sheikh</PERSON>, the owner of a shop selling leather goods who called for a
law that would prevent such books from being written again.
   ``There must be some way that governments can approve a
resolution that in future no writer should have a right to write
against any prophet _ Mohammed, Jesus or Moses,'' he said.
   Moslems revere Mohammed as the prophet who brought <ORGANIZATION>Allah</ORGANIZATION>'s
revelations to mankind in the <LOCATION>Koran</LOCATION>, the holy book of Islam.
   ``But do I personally agree with the ayatollah? It doesn't
matter,'' said <PERSON>Sheikh</PERSON>, one of the many Moslem Bangladeshis living in
the Brick Lane area.
   ``You can't stop the ayatollah. You can't stop the people who
will do the job ... Anyone who kills <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> will become a hero in
the Islamic world.''
   Like Sheikh, most Moslems acknowledged they haven't read the
book. Most learned about it at one of the five mosques located in a
one-square-mile area of this district, from leaflets, or from
television reports.
   ``He insulted our prophet, our religion. From TV we know this,''
said a shopkeeper selling sticky sweets who refused to give his name.
   Even though they haven't read the book, they are sure it insults
their prophet and are quick to say so when the novel is mentioned.
   ``Our older people read it, they say it's wrong, so we believe
them,'' <PERSON>Nassim Khan</PERSON>, a Pakistani Moslem, said as he ate lunch at a
modest tandoori restaurant. ``They've been studying for years and
years and they should know.''
   <PERSON>Maqbool Ali-Kassam</PERSON>, waiting for his takeout tea, boomed from
across the room: ``Anyone who denies the religion of Islam shall be
killed.''
   Ali-Kassam, a taxi cab radio controller who calls himself a
follower of the ayatollah, said he believes <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> deliberately
meant to insult Islam.
   Dozens of drivers from his company stayed at the office until
early <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME>, he said, arguing about the book and the
execution order. ``Some said he didn't mean anything about Islam,
others wanted him killed.''
   Many Moslems believe <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>, 41, insults Mohammed by portraying
him as a character called Mahound, a prophet of a city called
Jahilia. Mahound was a medieval corruption of the word Mohammed.
   They are especially angered by one sequence in which prostitutes
are given the names of some of Mohammed's nine wives and by the
book's implication that Mohammed, not Allah, may have been the real
author of the <LOCATION>Koran</LOCATION>.
   Rushdie was born into a Moslem family in <LOCATION>Bombay</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>, and
educated in <LOCATION>Cambridge</LOCATION>. He lives in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>. His novel has sold more
than 100,000 copies since it was published in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> in <DATE>September</DATE>
to critical acclaim.
   ``Previously Mohammed has been criticized, but not in this naked
way,'' said <PERSON>Abul Khair</PERSON>, a top officer at the <ORGANIZATION>Sonali Bank</ORGANIZATION>,
<LOCATION>Bangladesh</LOCATION>'s state bank, on Brick Lane. ``It is intolerable for
Moslems.''
   But he doesn't agree with the ayatollah. ``We don't want
violence. Islam is a peaceful religion,'' he said.
   Restaurant manager <PERSON>Asaad Ramjaun</PERSON>, a Mauritian immigrant, said of
Rushdie: ``I think he's the devil himself.''
   ``We understand this is a free society, but I think this is
freedom of abuse,'' he said. ``But since this is a free society _ he
shouldn't be killed. He should be given a chance.''

   In the name of the Almighty.
   After a thourough reading of ``The Satanic Verses'' book and its

   Coretta <PERSON>Scott King</PERSON> told new <ORGANIZATION>HUD</ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON>Jack
Kemp</PERSON> on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> he had raised expectations about the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>
administration's commitment to easing urban problems and now must
deliver.
   Kemp, in his first duties as the new secretary of housing and
urban development, completed a high-visibility tour of <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>'s
poor black neighborhoods and pledged to work to increase the
availability of afffor low-income people through
both public and private efforts.
   ``You have really raised our hopes and excited people about the
prospects of something happening with housordable housing ing and jobs,''
<PERSON>Mrs. King</PERSON>,
widow of the late civil rights leader <PERSON>Martin Luther King Jr.</PERSON>, told
<PERSON>Kemp</PERSON>.
   ``From what we've heard you say, we think you mean business,''
she said. ``If something happens and there is not the follow
through, you're going to have a lot of disappointed people.''
   Kemp met privately with <PERSON>Mrs. King</PERSON> and her sons, then attended a
meeting with black leaders.
   Kemp, an unsuccessful Republican presidential hopeful who has
sought to broaden the party's appeal to blacks, promised to work to
eliminate discrimination in housing, to support affirmative action
efforts and to encourage more housing for the poor.
   ``I'm commited to a vigorous effort to expand the housing stock,
both public and ot going to solve the problem,'' said <PERSON>Naim
Sheikh</PERSON>, the owner of a shop selling leather goods who called for a
law that would prevent such books from being written again.

<HEAD>Rushdie Embraces Islam, Won't Seek Paperback `Satanic Verses'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   <PERSON>Salman Rushdie</PERSON> said <DATE>Monday</DATE> that he has embraced
Islam and has given up his push for paperback publication of ``The
Satanic Verses,'' the book which brought him a death sentence from
<LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> nearly two years ago.
   He also pledged, in a statement released by a local Islamic
leader, that he would permit no further translations of the book.
   However, <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> defended his book as a ``moral fable'' about a
character who ``has lost his mind because he has lost his faith.''
   Rushdie has been in hiding under police guard since <DATE>February
1989</DATE>, when Iranian leader <PERSON>Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini</PERSON> sentenced him
to death for blasphemy.
   Iran offered a <MONEY>$1 million</MONEY> bounty for <ORGANIZATION>Rushdie</ORGANIZATION>'s death, and
Iranian authorities reconfirmed the death sentence and the bounty
earlier this month.
   Rushdie's statement was released by <PERSON>Dr. Hesham el-Essawy</PERSON>,
president of the Islamic Society for the <ORGANIZATION>Promotion of Religious
Tolerance</ORGANIZATION>. He said <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> typed the statement himself following a
meeting with Islamic scholars.
   In his statement, the author declared that he did ``not agree
with any statement in my novel `The Satanic Verses' uttered by any
of the characters who insults the prophet Mohammed, or casts
aspersions upon Islam, or upon the authenticity of the holy <LOCATION>Koran</LOCATION>,
or who rejects the divinity of Allah.''
   <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> said in a telephone hookup with a news conference that
it is up to Iranian leaders whether to withdraw the death sentence.
But he added, ``I feel a lot safer tonight than I felt yesterday.''
   Many Moslems worldwide objected to <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>'s use of the names of
the Prophet <PERSON>Mohammed</PERSON>'s wives for the prostitutes in his novel and
the implication that <PERSON>Mohammed</PERSON> wrote the <LOCATION>Koran</LOCATION>, Islam's holy book,
instead of receiving it from God.
   El-Essawy said <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> now had a ``clean slate'' with the Moslem
world because he had only now professed his belief that ``there is
no God but <LOCATION>Allah</LOCATION> and that <PERSON>Mohammed</PERSON> is his last prophet.''
   In addition to el-Essawy, <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> met with two imams from the
<ORGANIZATION>Regent</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>Park Mosque</LOCATION> - <PERSON>Dr. Zaki Badawi</PERSON>, principal of the <ORGANIZATION>Moslem
College</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Dr. Hohammed Ali Mahgoub</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>'s secretary
of state for endowment and head of the <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Council for Islamic
Affairs</ORGANIZATION>, as well as <PERSON>Yousef el-Sharkawy</PERSON>, second secretary at the
<ORGANIZATION>Egyptian Embassy</ORGANIZATION>.
   Rushdie's statement was welcomed by other Moslem leaders, who
nonetheless demanded that the book be withdrawn entirely from
circulation.
   ``Until the book is completely removed our campaign goes on,''
said <PERSON>Sher Azam</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Council</ORGANIZATION> for Mosques in <LOCATION>Bradford</LOCATION>, where the
book had been publicly burned.
   <PERSON>Iqbal Sacranie</PERSON>, joint convener of the <ORGANIZATION>United Kingdom Committee
on Islamic Affairs</ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>'s statement was a positive step,
but also called for ``the withdrawal from circulation of this
blasphemous book.''
   El-Essawy argued that <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> could not be sentenced to death as
an apostate because he had not been a believing Moslem when he
wrote the novel.
   He characterized <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> as a ``convert,'' and quoted the author
as saying, ``There is no difference between <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> and Islam.''
   ``This is the community that is close to my heart,'' <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>
told the news conference. ``To come closer to it has given me a
great deal of joy.''
   He said he would not permit any further translations of the book
``while any risk of further offense exists,'' and added that he
would ``continue to work for a better understanding of Islam in the
world, as I have always attempted to do in the past.''
   No one was available for comment <DATE>Monday</DATE> at Viking Penguin,
publishers the hardback book. However, the publisher had previously
shown no enthusiasm for a paperback, a position that had drawn
criticism from <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>.
   If there was no paperback, he said in an interview in <DATE>January</DATE>
with the Independent on <DATE>Sunday</DATE> newspaper, ``in a few years the book
simply won't be there for anyone who wants to read it. It will, in
all practical terms, have been suppressed.''
   ``The Satanic Verses'' has sold more than 1 million copies in
English - almost three-quarters of those in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> - and
was on the <DATE>Sunday</DATE> Times of <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>'s best-seller list for nearly a
year. It has been translated into 15 languages and banned in more
than 20 countries.
   Rushdie, born in <LOCATION>Bombay</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>, and now a naturalized British
citizen, has been in hiding since <DATE>Feb. 14, 1989</DATE>. His native country
was the first to ban the book, in <DATE>October 1988</DATE>.
   In <DATE>September 1989</DATE>, a trade survey found booksellers in <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>
divided on the question of stocking any paperback edition. Forty
percent said they would not handle it, <PERCENT>44 percent</PERCENT> said they would,
according to <ORGANIZATION>Publishing News</ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
   <PERSON>Salman Rushdie</PERSON> has embraced Islam and promised not
to authorize a paperback version of his controversial novel ``The
Satanic Verses,'' a group of Islamic and Egyptian officials
announced today.
   Earlier this year, <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> had insisted on the need for a
paperback version, but a spokeswoman for his defense committee
confirmed that the statement was genuine.
   In a statement released by <PERSON>Dr. Hesham el-Essawy</PERSON>, president of
the Islamic Society for the <ORGANIZATION>Promotion of Religious Tolerance</ORGANIZATION>,
<PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> also declared that he did not agree with any statement
uttered by characters in the book that cast aspersions on Islam,
questioned the authenticity of the <LOCATION>Koran</LOCATION>, or rejected the divinity
of Allah.
   He also agreed not to authorize any further translations of the
work.
   Rushdie did not disavow the book, but insisted today that it was
a moral fable. All the things that Moslems found insulting, he
said, ``take place in the dream of a man who has lost his mind. He
has lost his mind because he has lost his faith.''
   In a telephone hookup with a news conference organized by
el-Essawy, <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> said it was up to the government of <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> to
remove the death sentence against him. ``I feel a lot safer tonight
than I felt yesterday,'' he added.
   Rushdie has been in hiding under police guard since <DATE>February
1989</DATE>, when Iranian leader <PERSON>Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini</PERSON> said the
writer deserved death as a blasphemer. Iran offered a <MONEY>$1 million</MONEY>
bounty for <ORGANIZATION>Rushdie</ORGANIZATION>'s death.
   ``This is the way we hope that will earn <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>'s release from
his predicament. This is how we intend to make him a free man,''
said el-Essawy.
   El-Essawy argued, as he has in the past, that <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> could not
be sentenced to death as an apostate because he was not a believing
Moslem.
   Now that <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> has embraced the faith, by ``declaring there is
no God but <LOCATION>Allah</LOCATION> and that <PERSON>Mohammed</PERSON> is his last prophet,'' el-Essawy
said that ``the slate is wiped clean.''
   El-Essawy characterized <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> as a ``convert,'' and quoted the
author as saying, ``There is no difference between <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> and
Islam.''
   Other British Moslems who have been prominent in the controversy
demanded more from <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>.
   ``It puzzles me that he hasn't gone far enough to remove the
hardback, if that's the intention. The Moslem community has been
suffering for a long time,'' said <PERSON>Sher Azam</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Council</ORGANIZATION> for
Mosques in <LOCATION>Bradford</LOCATION>, where the book had been publicly burned.
   ``Until the book is completely removed our campaign goes on,''
<PERSON>Azam</PERSON> said.
   <PERSON>Iqbal Sacranie</PERSON>, joint convener of the <ORGANIZATION>UK Committee on Islamic
Affairs</ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>'s statement was a positive step. However,
``It seems to us that the most appropriate course of action ... is
the withdrawal from circulation of this blasphemous book.''
   Rushdie recently has come out of hiding for a television
interview, and on <DATE>Dec. 5</DATE> he appeared at a <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> bookshop to sign
copies of his latest book, ``Haroun and the Sea of Stories.''
   Iran severed diplomatic relations with <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> over ``The
Satanic Verses'' but ties were restored in <DATE>October</DATE> after an
18-month break. On <DATE>Dec. 9</DATE>, however, Iranian Minister of Culture
<PERSON>Mohammad Khatami</PERSON> said the death sentence against <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> could not
be revoked.
   El-Essawy said he met with <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> on <DATE>Friday</DATE> in a secure
location.
   He said they were joined at the meeting by <PERSON>Dr. Mohammed Ali
Mahgoub</PERSON>, an Egyptian government official who heads the <ORGANIZATION>Supreme
Council of Scholars of Islamic Affairs</ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON>Youssef Ahmed El Sharkawy</PERSON>,
2nd Secretary at the <ORGANIZATION>Egyptian Embassy</ORGANIZATION> and two clergy from the
<ORGANIZATION>Regent's Park Mosque</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>.
   According to el-Essawy, <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> made four points in the
statement:
   ``1. To witness that there is no God but <LOCATION>Allah</LOCATION>, and that
<PERSON>Mohammed</PERSON> is his last prophet.
   ``2. To declare that I do not agree with any statement in my
novel `The Satanic Verses' uttered by any of the characters who
insults the prophet Mohammed, or casts aspersions upon Islam, or
upon the authenticity of the holy koran, or who rejects the
divinity of Allah.
   ``3. I undertake not to publish the paperback edition of `The
Satanic Verses' or to permit any further agreement for translations
into other languages while any risk of further offense exists.
   ``4. I will continue to work for a better understanding of Islam
in the world, as I have always attempted to do in the past.''
   ``The Satanic Verses'' has sold more than 1 million copies in
English - almost three-quarters of those in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> - and
was on the <DATE>Sunday</DATE> Times of <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>'s best-seller list for nearly a
year. It has been translated into 15 languages and banned in more
than 20 countries.
   Rushdie, born in <LOCATION>Bombay</LOCATION> and now a naturalized British citizen,
has been in hiding since <DATE>Feb. 14, 1989</DATE>.
   Moslems worldwide objected to <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>'s use of the names of the
Prophet <PERSON>Mohammed</PERSON>'s wives for the prostitutes in his novel and the
implication that <PERSON>Mohammed</PERSON> wrote the Koran, Islam's holy book,
instead of receiving it from God.
   In <DATE>September 1989</DATE>, a trade survey found booksellers in <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>
divided on the question of stocking any paperback edition. Forty
percent said they would not handle it, <PERCENT>44 percent</PERCENT> said they would,
according to <ORGANIZATION>Publishing News</ORGANIZATION>.
   A <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> newspaper, The Observer, reported last year that <PERSON>Viking
Penguin</PERSON> had decided to publish the paperback in <DATE>1990</DATE>, but the
company never made any announcement.
   In <DATE>January</DATE>, the company said it was unlikely to announce its
plans in advance because of the security implications.

<HEAD>Author of Satanic Verses Says Islamic Fundamentalists Need Criticism</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Satanic Verses</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   <PERSON>Salman Rushdie</PERSON> said <DATE>today</DATE> the furor caused by his
book ``The Satanic Verses'' shows Moslem fundamentalist leaders in a
bad light and makes him wish he had been more critical.
   ``Frankly, I wish I had written a more critical book,'' he told
<ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION> ``This Morning.'' ``I mean, a religion that claims, that is able
to behave like this; religious leaders, let's say, who are able to
behave like this, and then say that this is a religion which must be
above any kind of whisper or criticism, that doesn't add up.''
   He added: ``It seems to me that Islamic fundamentalists could do
with a little bit of criticism right now.''
   Rushdie regretted the violence caused by opposition to his book,
but denied that it was blasphemous, as some Moslems contend.
   ``It's not true that this book is a blasphemy against Islam.
   ``I doubt very much that (Iranian Ayatollah Ruhollah) <PERSON>Khomeini</PERSON> or
anybody else in <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> has read the book or more than selected
extracts out of context.
   ``Obviously it's horrifying that people are willing to proceed in
this way against what is, after all, one novel in the face of the
entire history of Islam.''
   Asked how he reacts to a death threat from <PERSON>Khomeini</PERSON>, <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> said:
   ``I think I have to take them very seriously indeed.''
   He told <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION> ``Nightline'' on <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>:
   ``The blood is on the hands of people who inflame the feelings of
people who unfortunately have not and cannot read the book ...
   ``The idea that this is somehow an attack on the religion shows
an absolute failure to understand what fiction is,'' he said.
   Of the novel itself, <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION>:
   ``The sad thing is, of course, the book isn't really about Islam.
It's about migration and metamorphosis and all sorts of things.
There's one section where there are two dream sequences in the book,
in which what I've tried to do is write about the birth of a
religion which obviously is like Islam, but is a fictional departure
from Islam, and in that I've done it from a secular point of view.
   ``If you can't believe in the literal truth of God transmitting
words to a prophet ... then it seems to be a legitimate fictional
exercise to say what's really happening, what goes on, what is the
nature of revelation? ... How does a religion come into the world,
what compromises does it face, is it tolerant or intolerant?''
   He spoke about one section where a creature appearing to be like
Mohammed, the prophet Moslems believe is a messenger of <LOCATION>Allah</LOCATION>, is
given the name for the devil.
   ``The novel is about showing how devils are not always
devilish,'' <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION>. ``One of the novel's major emphases is
to reclaim negative images ...''
   ``My views don't have to be the same as the views of a fictional
character. Finally, the fictional character is actually losing his
mind, he's going insane, he's a paranoid schizophrenic.
   ``Now, when you've gone to that length to write fiction, it's
very odd to have it judged as if you were writing some kind of, as
they say, thinly veiled attack. It was never my intention.''

As anger over an allegedly blasphemous novel continued to gather force in the 
Islamic world, <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION>'s spiritual leader, the <PERSON>Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini</PERSON>, said 
<DATE>Tuesday</DATE> that the author and publishers of the book should be killed. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Tehran Radio</ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON>Khomeini</PERSON> issued a statement saying in part: "I inform the 
proud Muslim people of the world that the author of 'The Satanic Verses,' a 
book which is against Islam, the prophet and the <LOCATION>Koran</LOCATION>, and all those involved 
in its publication who were aware of its content, are hereby sentenced to 
death." 
</P>
<P>
Author <PERSON>Salman Rushdie</PERSON>, an Indian-born British citizen, told the <ORGANIZATION>British 
Broadcasting Corp.</ORGANIZATION> that he takes <PERSON>Khomeini</PERSON>'s threat "very seriously indeed." Not 
long afterward, he was reported to be in hiding and under police protection 
somewhere outside <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> offices of his publishers, the <ORGANIZATION>Penguin Group</ORGANIZATION>, were also under police 
guard. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Outraged Responses 
</P>
<P>
What <PERSON>Khomeini</PERSON> called a "sentence of death" was the latest in a series of 
outraged responses to the "The Satanic Verses." 
</P>
<P>
Although few in the Muslim world say they have read the prize-winning 
allegorical novel about <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s treatment of its colonial subjects, the book 
has provoked widespread outrage. In <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>, where the book was first 
published, there have been public book burnings in areas that have large Muslim 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
The book has been banned in <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Bangladesh</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>South 
Africa</LOCATION>. In the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>, Islamic militants have called for it 
to be withdrawn from the market and for Rushdie to publicly ask "forgiveness 
from <LOCATION>Almighty Allah</LOCATION> for the great insult which he has brought up." 
</P>
<P>
Publication of the book in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> sparked two days of rioting in 
Muslim areas of <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>. Over the <DATE>weekend</DATE>, demonstrators stoned the 
<ORGANIZATION>U.S. Cultural Center</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Islamabad</LOCATION> and five people were killed when riot police 
fired at the demonstrators. An Indian was killed <DATE>Monday</DATE> at a demonstration in 
<LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>, where protests continued <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>. Khomeini was quoted as 
saying <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> that "The Satanic Verses" was written and published "in 
opposition to Islam." 
</P>
<P>
"I call on all zealous Muslims to execute them quickly, wherever they find 
them, so that no one will dare to insult Islamic sanctity," <ORGANIZATION>Tehran Radio</ORGANIZATION> quoted 
him as saying. "Whoever is killed doing this will be regarded as a martyr and 
will go directly to heaven." 
</P>
<P>
The Iranian government declared today a day of national mourning to protest 
against the decision to publish "poisonous and insulting subject matter 
concerning Islam, the <LOCATION>Koran</LOCATION> and the blessed prophet." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tour Being Reconsidered 
</P>
<P>
Followers of Islam believe that the Prophet <PERSON>Mohammed</PERSON> is God's messenger on 
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and that the <LOCATION>Koran</LOCATION>, Islam's holy book, consists of revelations from the 
<LOCATION>Almighty</LOCATION> as given to Mohammed. 
</P>
<P>
In <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, a spokesman for <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>'s agent, <PERSON>Gillon Aitken</PERSON>, said a planned book 
promotion tour of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, scheduled to begin later this week, is now 
under review. 
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Secretary <PERSON>Geoffrey Howe</PERSON> expressed his "very real concern," and 
the British government was generally adopting a cautious stance on the threat 
to <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>, for fear of jeopardizing the safety of a British citizen imprisoned 
in <LOCATION>Tehran</LOCATION> as an alleged spy. 
</P>
<P>
Iranian Information Minister <PERSON>Mohammed Mohammedi-Reyshahri</PERSON> was quoted by the 
official news agency <ORGANIZATION>IRNA</ORGANIZATION> as saying that a court has completed its proceedings 
against British businessman <PERSON>Roger Cooper</PERSON>, held since <DATE>December, 1985</DATE>, and had 
imposed a "heavy sentence" on him. The minister added, without elaborating, 
that final judgment is still under consideration. 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> resumed diplomatic relations last <DATE>November</DATE>, and the British 
authorities had hoped that <PERSON>Cooper</PERSON> might be released as part of an amnesty 
announced to mark <DATE>last week</DATE>'s 10th anniversary of the Islamic revolution. 
</P>
<P>
Despite expressing concern about the danger to his life, <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>, in his 
interview with the <ORGANIZATION>BBC</ORGANIZATION>, was not in a mood to back down. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, at a personal level it's very worrying," the 41-year-old, 
Bombay-born author said in a brief film clip shown on the <ORGANIZATION>BBC</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Independent 
Television News</ORGANIZATION> here <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>. "But I think, beyond that, it shows this is 
a later stage in a campaign which began with smears and vilifications and 
distortions of the book which has escalated to all sorts of levels of violence. 
And, frankly, I wish I had written a more critical book. 
</P>
<P>
"A religion that is able to behave like this -- religious leaders, let's say, 
who are able to behave like this -- and then say that this is a religion that 
must be above any kind of whisper of criticism; I mean, that doesn't add up. It 
seems to me that Islamic fundamentalists could do with a little criticism right 
now." 
</P>
<P>
In a statement distributed <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> <TIME>evening</TIME>, <ORGANIZATION>Penguin</ORGANIZATION>'s Viking unit, whose 
trademark appears on the British and <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> editions of <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>'s novel, 
commented: "Neither we nor the author of this novel published the book with 
intent to offend. We very much regret the distress the book has caused." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'<ORGANIZATION>Tragic Loss of Life</ORGANIZATION>' 
</P>
<P>
Referring to six people killed in anti-Rushdie demonstrations, the Viking 
statement said, "We are appalled at the tragic loss of life that has already 
occurred and deplore calls to future violence." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION>Penguin Group</ORGANIZATION> confirmed that it has stepped up its security 
precautions after the <PERSON>Khomeini</PERSON> threat. The spokesman refused to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
The threat to <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> is being taken seriously. <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> has about a million 
Muslims among its 55 million people, and they have been an increasingly 
militant minority. 
</P>
<P>
The People's Moujahedeen of <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION>, a dissident exile group, called <PERSON>Khomeini</PERSON>'s 
action "absurd" and "hysterical." 
</P>
<P>
Rushdie, who was born in <LOCATION>Bombay</LOCATION> but came to <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> as a 14-year-old schoolboy, 
has described himself as a lapsed Muslim but insists that his book is not 
intended to be anti-religious. A British reviewer termed it "a sort of 'Last 
Temptation of Mohammed,' " in the spirit of the controversial Greek novel and 
American film, "The Last Temptation of Christ." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> said in an interview last <DATE>Sunday</DATE> with the Guardian newspaper that he 
was "very upset" by the deaths that resulted from demonstrations against his 
book in <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>. However, he said: "The deaths are not on my conscience. I am 
a writer trying to deal with real issues. I have not arranged any marches on 
embassies or arranged for shots to be fired. . . . I am completely horrified. 
The idea that people should directly or indirectly be dead as a result of (the 
book) is hard to believe."

<TEXT>
   <PERSON>Salman Rushdie</PERSON>'s ``Satanic Verses'' is a dizzying
547-page journey through countless plots, subplots, satire and
philosophical discussions.
   It also is That Book, the work that has so enraged the Islamic
world that the author has been condemned to death. The controversy
has revived age-old questions of censorship and freedom of religion.
   Lyrical, scathing, inquisitive and at times bewildering, the
novel deals with preconceptions of good and evil, <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s
treatment of illegal aliens, the desire by Indians to become
assimilated into British culture and, most notably, the birth of the
Islamic faith.
   Rushdie, a 41-year-old <LOCATION>Bombay</LOCATION> native of Moslem parents, writes in
a stream-of-consciousness style that leaves the reader alternately
exhilarated, bewildered and _ depending on one's religious and
political orientation _ outraged.
   The novel has been condemned by Moslems for its dream sequences
that portray the prophet <PERSON>Mohammed</PERSON> as a womanizer, a coward willing
to compromise his faith for general acceptance and a conniving
businessman who makes up laws to suit his own purposes.
   It also contains a sequence in which a Persian scribe alters the
holy laws as dictated by <PERSON>Mohammed</PERSON>, who is referred to in the book as
Mahound.
   Moslems revere Mohammed as the prophet who brought them <ORGANIZATION>Allah</ORGANIZATION>'s
revelations in the <LOCATION>Koran</LOCATION>, the holy book of Islam.
   The book prompted <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini</PERSON> to put a
price on the author's life, sending <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> into hiding, along with
his wife.
   ``The Satanic Verses'' begins with terrorists blowing up a jet en
route to <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>. Two passengers _ <PERSON>Gibreel Farishta</PERSON>, an Indian actor
who specializes in religious roles, and <PERSON>Saladin Chamcha</PERSON>, a British
radio star able to reproduce a myriad of voices _ fall from the
plane and survive. Rushdie writes:
   ```To be born again,' sang Gibreel Farishta tumbling from the
heavens, `first you have to die. Ho ji! Ho ji! To land upon the
bosomy earth, first one needs to fly. Tat-taa! Taka-thun! How to
ever smile again, if first you won't cry? How to win the darling's
love, mister, without a sigh? Baba, if you want to get born again
...'''
   The two men emerge on an English coast. Gibreel begins to assume
an ``angelic glow,'' while <PERSON>Saladin</PERSON> grows horns and hooves and is
arrested as an illegal immigrant.
   The novel's turning point comes when Gibreel, whose halo dazzles
police, denies to authorities that he knows <PERSON>Saladin</PERSON>. By having
Gibreel commit an evil act wearing a halo and subjecting <PERSON>Saladin</PERSON> to
the brutal treatment of the English police, <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> confounds
reality. Which one is evil? Which one is good?
   The book's second, fourth and sixth chapters, ``Mahound,''
``Ayesha'' and ``Return to Jahilia,'' contain the most controversial
elements.
   Gibreel dreams about the city of <LOCATION>Jahilia</LOCATION>, built entirely of sand.
One of <LOCATION>Jahilia</LOCATION>'s citizens is Mahound, a
``businessman-turned-prophet'' who is starting a new religion.
Unfortunately for Mahound, the city already has 360 gods and little
use for more.
   Mahound's chance for recognition comes when the head of the
city's ruling council proposes a deal: If <ORGANIZATION>Mahound</ORGANIZATION>'s Allah (the
Islamic god) will accept three of the local gods (Lat, Uzza and
Manat) as archangels in his sect, his religion will receive
certification and <ORGANIZATION>Mahound</ORGANIZATION> will have a seat on the council.
   Mahound, always the practical businessman, sees the deal as a
good opportunity to attract converts. So he climbs a mountain to
consult with the archangel, none other than Gibreel himself. Rashdie
writes of Mahound's moral dilemma:
   ```The souls of the city, of the world, surely they are worth
three more angels? Is Allah so unbending that he will not embrace
three more to save the human race?''
   Although he does not actually hear an answer, Mahound undergoes
what he considers a revelation in the archangel's presence,
believing he should make the deal.
   But he soon learns that the supposedly divine message did not
come from <PERSON>Gibreel</PERSON> but the Devil, who had been impersonating the
archangel. Mahound renounces the satanic ``verses'' and substitutes
these words, which closely follow the spirit of the actual <LOCATION>Koran</LOCATION>,
about Lat, Uzza and Manat:
   ``They are but names you have dreamed of, you and your fathers.
Allah invests no authority in them.''
   Rushdie takes the story a step further by having Gibreel claim
that both answers came from him, blurring the distinction between
God and Satan.
   Mahound and his followers eventually settle in the ``friendly
oasis'' of Yathrib, just as Mohammed journeyed from <LOCATION>Mecca</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Medina</LOCATION>.
In Yathrib, Mahound proceeds to dictate to the Persian scribe Salman
the rules of the new religion as proscribed by <ORGANIZATION>Gibreel</ORGANIZATION>.
   However, <PERSON>Salman</PERSON> becomes convinced that Mahound is making up the
rules himself and decides to test his leader by deliberately
changing what is recited to him. The scribe, fearing for his life if
Mahound discovers his trick, flees <PERSON>Yathrib</PERSON> and concludes his part of
the story by stating, ``It's his Word against mine.''
   Rushdie has said his characters ``seek to become fully human by
facing up to the great facts of love, death and (with or without
God), the life of the soul. Outside it, the forces of humanity are
on the march.''

<TEXT>
   Moslem fundamentalists around the
world demand that <PERSON>Salman Rushdie</PERSON>'s novel ``The Satanic Verses'' be
banned as blasphemy against Islam, and this <DATE>weekend</DATE> the campaign
turned violent.
   At least five people were killed and more than 80 injured <DATE>Sunday</DATE>
when police fired on a mob trying to storm the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Information
Center</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Islamabad</LOCATION>. The protesters demanded the book be banned in
the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>.
   Fundamentalists say the book does not recognize Islam as the one
true religion and ridicules the most precious Moslem beliefs.
Pakistan and other Moslem nations banned the book after its
publication last year.
   Rushdie, 41, was born in <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> to Moslem parents and educated in
<LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>, where he lives. His other books include ``Midnight's
Children,'' which won <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s prestigious Booker prize, ``Shame''
and ``The Jaguar Smile.''
   The literary success of ``The Satanic Verses,'' a complex work
that focuses on good and evil, has been confined to a fairly small
intellectual readership in Western nations. In <DATE>November</DATE>, the book
won the ``new novel'' category in the annual literary competition
sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION>Whitbread</ORGANIZATION> brewing giant, but it did not win the
overall <ORGANIZATION>Whitbread</ORGANIZATION> prize.
   Leaders of the <LOCATION>Islamabad</LOCATION> march said it was intended to be
peaceful but police reacted improperly.
   Government officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the protest apparently was inspired by reviews last week in
international news magazines. One official said: ``The reviews had
the first details anyone had about the book. Nobody here has read
the book.''
   ``The Satanic Verses'' is a rambling fantasy on the birth of
religion, modern history and human relations. It begins with two men
tumbling skyward from a jumbo jet destroyed by a terrorist bomb and
chronicles their adventures.
   A part of the novel fictionalizes certain episodes from the
<LOCATION>Koran</LOCATION>, the Moslem holy book, and the life of the prophet Mohammed in
what Western book critics say is clearly satire. They have praised
the book for imaginative vision and depth.
   The author says his book is a work of fiction that does not
attack Islam, contains no blasphemy and is not intended to offend
anyone.
   ``It is not a source of satisfaction to me to be banned in the
Moslem world,'' he said in a recent interview with the <ORGANIZATION>Herald</ORGANIZATION>, a
Pakistani magazine.
   Moslem leaders describe the novel as an attack on Mohammed
intended to insult Moslems and lead them astray.
   Syed <PERSON>Mohammed Younus Kazmi</PERSON>, a Pakistani Moslem leader, said:
``The book has fictitious characters that carricature the holy
prophet and his companions. The book contains insulting and
derogratory remarks.''
   Kazmi and other Islamic theologians say the book must be banned
because it does not treat Mohammed as the prophet of the world's one
true religion. They believe <PERSON>Mohammed</PERSON> and the Koran must be portrayed
only as representing divine truth.
   ``<PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> has offended millions of Moslems around the world,''
<PERSON>Kazmi</PERSON> said in an interview. ``Such a person cannot be allowed to do
these things.''
   Fundamentalist leaders claimed <DATE>Sunday</DATE>'s march was not an
anti-American protest, even though many of their followers see the
<LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> as a corrupt secular culture and enemy of Islam.
Protesters chanted ``American dogs'' and other slogans against the
<LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>.
   ``It was not an attack on the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>. We just hoped to
create moral support for our cause to stop this unholy book being
printed again,'' <PERSON>Kazmi</PERSON> said.
   Leaflets circulated by fundamentalist groups characterize the
novel as a blasphemous, semi-pornographic attack that says the
prophet was inspired by the devil, his wife was a prostitute and his
companions were evil.
   ``There are insulting remarks in this book,'' said <PERSON>Mohammed
Sadiq</PERSON>, a theology student. ``There are lies in this book. We want
this book banned in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> and around the world.''
   According to the author, his novel has been distorted by
fundamentalists who have not read it and oppose any idea that does
not reflect their fanatical literal faith. He said he has received
death threats.
   Rushdie has declared himself fascinated by religion and its
development and role in history.
   He has been quoted as saying religions are ``codes with which
human beings have tried to understand their presence on the planet
and discuss their moral behavior. My point of view is that of a
secular human being. I do not believe in supernatural entities,
whether Christian, <LOCATION>Jewish</LOCATION>, Moslem or Hindu.''
   Prime Minister <PERSON>Benazir Bhutto</PERSON> and other government leaders called
the protest at the American center an attack by fundamentalist
parties trying to drive her from office by straining relations with
<LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>'s ally, the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>.
   Rushdie says he has every right to deal with Islam in a creative
fashion, and ``I am not going to run away from the subject because
it is my subject and it is my birthright and nobody can take that
away from me.''

<TEXT>
   An Islamic scholar has written a book he
says will refute ``The Satanic Verses,'' the novel that sent author
<PERSON>Salman Rushdie</PERSON> into hiding to escape death at the hands of enraged
Moslems.
   The new book is scheduled for release next <DATE>April</DATE> by Penguin,
which also published the Rushdie novel in <DATE>1988</DATE>, setting off
worldwide protests, riots, diplomatic standoffs and debates on
freedom of expression.
   The Bombay-born <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>, now a naturalized British citizen, has
been in hiding since <DATE>Feb. 14, 1989</DATE>, when <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION>'s late leader, the
<PERSON>Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini</PERSON>, ordered Moslems to execute <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> for
blasphemy.
   <PERSON>Rafiq Zakaria</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Bombay</LOCATION> Moslem whose 70,000-word manuscript has
been accepted by the London-based Penguin publishing company, said
his book is to expose the ``baselessness of whatever Rushdie
attributed to the prophet'' Mohammed.
   He described his book, ``Muhammad and the Quran,'' as ``a case
for Islam.''
   ``I believe that the evidence is so overwhelmingly against what
<PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> has written that the best answer is to convict him
intellectually and not physically,'' <PERSON>Zakaria</PERSON> said.
   Moslems worldwide objected to <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> using the names of
Mohammed's wives for prostitutes in his novel and the implication
that the prophet wrote the Koran _ Islam's holy book _ instead of
receiving it from God.
   A week after <PERSON>Khomeini</PERSON>'s death edict, <LOCATION>Bombay</LOCATION> became the
flashpoint of anti-Rushdie protests that spread to other Indian
cities. In the following days, at least 19 people died in riots and
clashes with police in <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and neighboring <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>.
   <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> and several other countries banned ``The
Satanic Verses.'' Later, <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> severed diplomatic ties with <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>,
accusing the British government of supporting <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>.
   ``I have traced the campaign of calumny against Islam right from
the birth of the prophet and culminating in <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>'s book,'' said
<PERSON>Zakaria</PERSON>.
   A senior editor of <ORGANIZATION>Penguin Books Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> said a paperback
edition of ``Muhammad and the Quran'' will be published by <DATE>April</DATE>.
   The editor said, however, the book was not planned as a reaction
to ``The Satanic Verses.''
   ``It is an incredibly impressive study of the thinking of Islam
looking at Western prejudices,'' she said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   Zakaria, a 64-year-old academician and author of seven previous
books, described his latest effort as ``maybe a reaction to the
vituperative attacks and innuendos by <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> and his
predecessors.''
   ``I have tried to show how most of it is based on deep-rooted
prejudice first between Moslems and Jews and then between Moslems
and Christians,'' he said.
   The author attributed the ``unfortunately'' large sales of
<PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>'s book to <PERSON>Khomeini</PERSON>'s death threat but said he neither
condemned the order nor upheld it because, ``by doing so I take a
pontifical position.''
   Nobody can take a pontifical position in Islam because the
religion does not recognize priesthood and teaches that there is no
intermediary between man and God, he said.

<HEAD>Rushdie Says He Wants Reconciliation With Islam</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   <PERSON>Salman Rushdie</PERSON> says he is optimistic that he can
work out a reconciliation with Moslems, but an Iranian leader says
the death sentence against the Indian-born author of ``The Satanic
Verses'' can never be lifted.
   ``I have to hope that the atmosphere is gradually changing. I
think there's various signs that it might be,'' <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION>CBS
News</ORGANIZATION> correspondent <PERSON>Mike Wallace</PERSON> in an interview for <DATE>Sunday</DATE>'s
edition of ``60 Minutes.''
   In a separate interview, Rajei-Khorrasani, a powerful leader in
<LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION>'s parliament, said the death sentence cannot be lifted
``because it is a religious fact, which remains there forever.''
   Rushdie, 43, a Bombay-born British subject, has been in hiding
under police guard since <DATE>Feb. 14, 1989</DATE>, when <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION>'s spiritual
leader, <PERSON>Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini</PERSON>, declared his novel an affront
to Islam and ordered Moslems to kill him. Khomeini died <DATE>June 3,
1989</DATE>.
   Iranian clerics offered a <MONEY>$5.2-million</MONEY> bounty for <ORGANIZATION>Rushdie</ORGANIZATION>'s
assassination.
   Among parts of the ``The Satanic Verses'' many Moslems find
offensive are a scene in which prostitutes are given the names of
the prophet <PERSON>Mohammed</PERSON>'s wives, and implications that <PERSON>Mohammed</PERSON> wrote
the <LOCATION>Koran</LOCATION>, the Moslem holy book.
   <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> said he never meant to insult the Moslem world.
   ``If I'm accused of calling the prophet's wives whores, I didn't
do it,'' he said.
   ``I'm not this kind of creature with horns and a tail that's
been painted,'' he said. ``There is actually very little in
`Satanic Verses' that hasn't been, in fact, quite commonplace
discussion in the Moslem world for hundreds of years.''
   <PERSON>Wallace</PERSON> said he met with the author at a police officers' club
on the outskirts of <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>.

<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The leader of Moslems in <LOCATION>Belgium</LOCATION>, the
<LOCATION>Netherlands</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Luxembourg</LOCATION> and his aide were shot and killed
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, five weeks after the imam distanced himself from <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION>'s
death sentence for author <PERSON>Salman Rushdie</PERSON>.
   Imam <PERSON>Abdullah Al Ahdal</PERSON>, a 36-year-old Saudi Arabian and moderate
Moslem, and <PERSON>Salem El Behir</PERSON>, a 40-year-old Tunisian who headed the
<LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION> mosque's social services and library, were shot at close
range in the imam's office in the mosque, police said.
   No one immediately claimed responsibility, and no arrests were
made. Police said there were no witnesses and that no one heard the
gunshots.
   The two men each were shot twice, once in the head and once in
the neck, police said. Unconfirmed reports said three hooded men
were seen jumping from a van, entering the mosque and then coming
out again.
   The bodies were found by members of the Islamic community early
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>evening</TIME>.
   On <DATE>Feb. 14</DATE>, Iranian revolutionary patriarch <PERSON>Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini</PERSON> issued a death sentence for <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> for ``The Satanic
Verses,'' a novel many Moslems consider blasphemous.
   In a <DATE>Feb. 20</DATE> interview on <ORGANIZATION>RTBF</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Belgium</LOCATION>'s French-language
television network, Ahdal agreed that <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>'s book was
blasphemous.
   But he said of <PERSON>Khomeini</PERSON>'s death sentence: ``One should not have
done that. Rushdie should have first appeared (before an Islamic
tribunal). He should have explained himself, defend himself. He
should have been asked to repent.''
   In democratic societies ``everyone has the right to speak his
thoughts, to express himself as he wants,'' <PERSON>Ahdal</PERSON> said.
   <PERSON>Claude van Engeland</PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION>RTBF</ORGANIZATION> reporter, said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> the
network had received angry phone calls after the interview from
callers who claimed Ahdal, who spoke in Arabic, was improperly
translated.
   Ahdal's mosque, in a park near the <ORGANIZATION>European Economic Community</ORGANIZATION>
headquarters, is part of the London-based World Islamic League.
   After the killings, police cordoned off the building.
   At one point a woman wearing a black veil emerged from the
building and threatened a reporter with a handgun. Several police
officers struggled with the woman and wrested the gun from her.
They said later she was Ahdal's widow.
   Rushdie, a Briton who was born in <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> to a Moslem family but
no longer practices religion, is in hiding in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>. Moslems
object to ``The Satanic Verses'' because of a brothel scene in
which prostitutes take the names of the Prophet Mohammed's wives
and because it suggests Mohammed wrote the holy Koran instead of
receiving it from <LOCATION>Allah</LOCATION>.
   Members of the Islamic community told reporters outside the
building their mosque takes a very conciliatory tone.
   ``We respect everybody,'' one said on condition of anonymity.
``We do not take radical positions.''
   Ahdal had been in <LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION> for six years heading the Moslem
community in <LOCATION>Belgium</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>Netherlands</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Luxembourg</LOCATION>. His aide had
been here for about 10 years.
   Mohammed Sulim, a professor of Islamic religion, asked the
Moslem community to remain calm.
   He said, ``We are a few days from the <LOCATION>Ramadan</LOCATION>,'' which Moslems
mark with a month of fasting during the day.
   ``These are days for prayer. One must not seek revenge. The imam
was a tolerant man, a generous man, he lent his money to several
people.''

<TEXT>     Anyone who's read one of <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>'s multi-layered, allegorical, fantastical,
satirical novels would suspect that nothing <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> says has only one
meaning.;    After a <ORGANIZATION>Christmas Eve</ORGANIZATION> meeting with six moderate Muslim leaders,
<PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> issued a statement saying "I do not agree with any statements in my
novel . . . uttered by any of the characters who insult the prophet Mohammed,
or cast aspersions upon Islam, or upon the authenticity of the holy <LOCATION>Koran</LOCATION>, or
who reject the divinity of Allah.";    About 1.2-million English-language
copies of "The Satanic Verses," about the improbable adventures of a Muslim
immigrant in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>, have been sold (though not necessarily read), and the
book has been translated into 15 languages.;    <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> described the book in
his op-ed piece as "a parable of how a man can be destroyed by loss of faith .
. . the dreams in which all the so-called 'insults' (to Islam) occur are
portraits of his disintegration and explicitly referred to in the novel as
punishments and retributions.";    While not withdrawing the book from stores,
<PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> promised not to permit new translations of "The Satanic Verses," or an
English-language paperback edition, and pledged "to work for a better
understanding of Islam.";    <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> may be able to sit and schmooze with
leaders of the Islamic Society for the <ORGANIZATION>Promotion of Religious Tolerance</ORGANIZATION> in the
<LOCATION>United Kingdom</LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Council of Scholars of Islamic Affairs</ORGANIZATION>, but
he's still having trouble with the ayatollah's heirs.;    An editorial in the
newspaper Tehran Abrar promptly rejected his apology, saying the ayatollah's
death sentence "is irrevocable even if (Rushdie) repents.";    On the other
hand, <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION>'s new leaders are prone to playing good mullah, bad mullah, and
some believe <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>'s recantation eventually will do the trick.;    The
religious thugs' attempt to silence <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> is an affront to human freedom. It
is distinctly unpleasant to see a novelist forced to beg forgiveness and
suppress wider publication of his own book.;    Still, the writer is not only
alive, he's writing.;    In <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>'s new book, "Haroun and the Sea of
Stories," which is dedicated to his son, the boy <PERSON>Haroun</PERSON> undertakes a quest to
free his father, the <ORGANIZATION>Shah of Blah</ORGANIZATION>, from storytellers' block caused by the
fanatical Khattam-Shud, who has poisoned the Ocean of the Streams of Story. As
the enemy of "stories and fancies and dreams" explains to Haroun: "Your world,
my world, all worlds are there to be Ruled. And inside every single story,
inside every Stream in the <LOCATION>Ocean</LOCATION>, there lies a world, a storyworld, that I
cannot Rule at all. And that is the reason why.";    And that is the reason
why <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> must not be silenced.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>
   A colorful, easy-to-read version of the Koran in
comic book form has won approval from some Islamic authorities, but
one scholar has condemned it, calling the author ``a new Salman
Rushdie.''
   ``Si Le Coran M'etait Conte'' _ ``If the Koran Were Told To
Me,'' is geared to readers aged 12 to 16, said its author, <PERSON>Youssef
Seddik</PERSON>.
   The Koran is the sacred book of Islam. According to Islamic
belief, it contains the words of God as revealed to the prophet
Mohammed.
   The comic books, which cost about <MONEY>$10</MONEY> each, have been approved
and even encouraged by some religious authorities such as <PERSON>Ayatollah
Mehdi Rouhani</PERSON>, spiritual leader of the Shiite Moslem community in
<LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>.
   ``I don't see any problem with the comic books, as long as you
know there is a precedent _ an illustrated version of the Koran
published in <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> <DATE>15 years ago</DATE>,'' <PERSON>Rouhani</PERSON> said in an interview at
his <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> home.
   Rouhani called comic books ``the language of the <DATE>20th century</DATE>.''
   ``I'm all for comic books, and would encourage them if they do,
in fact, get across the idea of God to young people,'' he said.
   But <PERSON>Mohammed Faidallah</PERSON>, head of Islamic Jurisprudence at <ORGANIZATION>Kuwait
University</ORGANIZATION>'s Islamic Studies faculty, was quoted <DATE>Friday</DATE> as saying
the comic books could spark a furor like that over <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>'s novel,
``The Satanic Verses.''
   In <DATE>February 1989</DATE>, <PERSON>Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini</PERSON> said <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>
should die because his novel blasphemed Islam. Rushdie has been in
hiding ever since.
   Faidallah said the comic books constituted a ``criminal act that
ridicules the sanctity of the holy Koran,'' and called for their
condemnation, the <LOCATION>Kuwait</LOCATION> newspaper Al-Qabas reported.
   He was quoted as calling Seddik ``a new Salman Rushdie recruited
to carry out this ugly task.'' Faidallah urged Arab and Islamic
embassies in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> ``to pressure official bodies there with a view
to halting such violation of Islamic values,'' the daily said.
   Seddik, a Tunisian-born journalist who has written extensively
on Arab culture, said <DATE>Friday</DATE> he was ``deeply saddened'' by
<ORGANIZATION>Faidallah</ORGANIZATION>'s reaction and disputed the scholar's right to judge the
issue.
   ``Islam is my emotional and spiritual roots. Nothing, no one can
ever take it away from me,'' he said.
   ``I'm deeply attached to the principle that distinguishes Islam
from <PERSON>Judaiism</PERSON> and Christianity: that it does not accept the idea of
the clergy. Only the knowledge, competence and good intentions of
the humblest Moslem can judge our actions.''
   In an earlier interview, <PERSON>Seddik</PERSON> said he was motivated to adapt
the Koran because of his frustration from studying the text as a
child.
   ``I remember feeling very sad that we had to learn the text by
heart, without any comprehension or understanding of what it
meant,'' said <PERSON>Seddik</PERSON>, 46. ``I was one of the lucky ones _ my father
was a learned man and he would explain things to me at home.''
   Seddik said the drawings and simple language can help young
readers follow the narrative development of the Koran's many
episodes, while avoiding its ``inextricable forest of syntactic,
lexical and theological difficulties.''
   Volume One, ``The Cursed Peoples,'' contains vivid pictures of
dessert peoples worshiping idols, living in sin, and deaf to pleas
of the prophets to change their ways and worship a single God.
   The drawings, which <PERSON>Rouhani</PERSON> described as ``naive and
simplistic,'' are accompanied by exact quotations from the <LOCATION>Koran</LOCATION>,
complete with chapter and verse references. The prophets are not
represented, but evoked by flashes of light.
   Seddik said he was careful not to offend or blaspheme in any
way, and even destroyed 10,000 copies of a <DATE>1986</DATE> edition that
displeased religious leaders.
   The new version, he said, got the OK from religious bodies in
<LOCATION>Algeria</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Tunisia</LOCATION>.
   A spokesman for the rector of the <LOCATION>Grand Mosque</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> was less
enthusiastic. ``Comic books dealing with transcendental issues have
no instructive value, and, in fact frustrate the development of the
adolescent imagination,'' said <PERSON>Jhaothy Hadjeddine Sari</PERSON>.
   ``Imposing an image of the transcendental on a young person is
tantamount to castration,'' he said. ``I can't see teaching the
Koran in comic books any more than I can imagine teaching
philospohy or math.''
   Seddik said his desire to publish the comic books was
politically motivated.
   ``The rise of Arab fundamentalism is partly a result of the way
the <LOCATION>Koran</LOCATION> is being taught as something opaque and incantatory,
understood by the elite few who run Islam like a secret society to
which only they have access,'' he said.
   Seddik said the wisdom of the Koran should be available to
everyone ``so people can draw their own conclusions and decide how
to live their lives.''
   Seddik admits that comic books violate one of the key tenants of
Islam: the reproduction of images. ``Of course, it's a taboo, but
I'm willing to assume full responsibility,'' he said.
   Seddik says he respects the sacredness of Islam.
   ``I don't blaspheme, I don't portray Aicha as a prostitute,'' he
said, referring to a passage in ``The Satanic Verses'' about
Mohammed's child bride that offended many Moslems.
   Seddik said the seven-volume project was financed by <PERSON>Hocine
Meddahi</PERSON>, an Algerian industrialist who lives in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>. Three
volumes have already appeared, in French and Arabic, and an English
translation is in progress.

<HEAD>Britain Taking Threats Against Diplomats Seriously</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The <ORGANIZATION>Foreign Office</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>Friday</DATE> it is taking
seriously death threats against British diplomats in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> in
connection with <PERSON>Salman Rushdie</PERSON>'s book ``The Satanic Verses.''
   Senior diplomatic officials were singled out in letters written
by a group calling itself The Defenders of Islamic Purity, a
spokesman said, speaking anonymously in keeping with British
practice.
   He said ``appropriate action'' was taken, but no details were
being revealed about people threatened or in what countries they
worked.
   Many Moslems around the world say <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>'s novel blasphemes
Islam. The book includes a scene in which prostitutes take the
names of the prophet <PERSON>Mohammed</PERSON>'s wives, and it suggests Mohammed
wrote the holy <LOCATION>Koran</LOCATION>, instead of receiving it from <LOCATION>Allah</LOCATION>.
   On <DATE>Feb. 14</DATE>, <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION>'s leader <PERSON>Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini</PERSON> issued a
death sentence against <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>, who remains in hiding. Rushdie,
born in <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> of Moslem parents, now is a British citizen.
   The <LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION> newspaper <PERSON>Libre Belgique</PERSON> said <DATE>Friday</DATE> in an article
signed by crime reporter <PERSON>Roger Rosart</PERSON> that the <ORGANIZATION>British Embassy</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION> received threats.
   An embassy spokesman in <LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION> confirmed that, but said no
staff were singled out by name and no staff were moved to other
posts, reported <ORGANIZATION>Press Association</ORGANIZATION>, the British domestic news agency.
   Belgian authorities would not comment.
   Rosart said three letters from The Defenders of Islamic Purity
which came into the hands of Belgian police blamed the British
attitude in the <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> affair and listed British diplomats who
were to be killed soon. It said two of the letters went to the
embassy.
   The paper reported that the threats warned family and friends to
steer clear of intended victims lest they be harmed, too. It said a
large number of these diplomats either returned to <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> or were
transferred elsewhere.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Foreign Office</ORGANIZATION> spokesman said: ``Similar letters have gone
to various embassies in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>. These threats are always taken
seriously and we have acted accordingly.''
   Libre <PERSON>Belgique</PERSON> said Belgian authorities were arranging strict
protective measures in view of the <LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION> murder of <PERSON>Imam Abdullah
Al-Ahdal</PERSON> and his aide on <DATE>March 29</DATE>.
   Ahdal, a Saudi cleric and leader of the Moslems of <LOCATION>Belgium</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Luxembourg</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Netherlands</LOCATION>, was shot after receiving death
threats for opposing <PERSON>Khomeini</PERSON>'s death sentence on <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>.
   In other <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> developments:
   _<LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> strongly protested the showing and sale of a few copies of
``The Satanic Verses'' during <LOCATION>Geneva</LOCATION>'s International Book Fair. A
statement issued by the <ORGANIZATION>Iranian Embassy</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Bern</LOCATION> on <DATE>Friday</DATE> said the
action violates Swiss laws calling for respect of religious beliefs
and insults the rights of more than 90,000 Moslems living in
<LOCATION>Switzerland</LOCATION>.
   _A judge in <LOCATION>Caracas</LOCATION> ruled on <DATE>Thursday</DATE> in favor of <LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION>'s
Islamic Center, saying publication of ``The Satanic Verses''
violated religious freedom. The Islamic Center, representing
Venezuelan Moslems, had brought suit against a publisher planning
to bring out the book.

   Iran on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> placed a <MONEY>$2.6 million</MONEY> bounty on the head of
<PERSON>Salman Rushdie</PERSON>, whose novel ``The Satanic Verses'' has enraged the
world's Moslems. Rushdie dropped from sight and canceled a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
promotional tour due to start <DATE>Friday</DATE>.
   Police guarded <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>'s home and his publishers.
   ``If the executioner is a foreigner he will receive a <MONEY>million
dollars</MONEY>,'' said <PERSON>Hojatoleslam Hassan Saneie</PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION>15th Khordad
Relief Agency</ORGANIZATION>, according to the Iranian news agency.
   The reward for an Iranian, however, will be 200 million rials, or
<MONEY>$2.6 million</MONEY>, the <ORGANIZATION>Islamic Republic News Agency</ORGANIZATION> quoted Saneie as
saying.
   The Times of <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> on <DATE>Thursday</DATE> quoted a former Pakistani
minister of information and religious affairs, <PERSON>Moulana Kausar Niazi</PERSON>,
as saying death squads from <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> and other Moslem states were on
their way to <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> to kill <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>, who lives in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Tehran Radio</ORGANIZATION> denounced the book as ``a shameless onslaught on the
sacred character of Islam's prophet'' and protesters shattered
windows at the <ORGANIZATION>British Embassy</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Tehran</LOCATION>.
   The radio said <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION>'s ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION>Vatican</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Salman Ghaffari</PERSON>,
urged Pope <PERSON>John Paul II</PERSON> to ``seriously oppose'' the publication of
the Italian translation of the book ``and prove that he defends
religion and spirituality.''
   ``With a glance at the writer of this book one may see the hidden
hands of world imperialism and the devious role of arrogance in the
activities of publication agencies which serve it,'' said a <ORGANIZATION>Tehran
Radio</ORGANIZATION> broadcast monitored by the <ORGANIZATION>British Broadcasting Corp</ORGANIZATION>.
   About 2,000 noisy protesters appeared at the <ORGANIZATION>British Embassy</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Tehran</LOCATION>, Charge d'Affaires <PERSON>Nick Browne</PERSON> told BBC-TV, but he said
authorities protected the embassy and the seven people inside.
   ``There was never any question of any of us being in danger,''
<PERSON>Browne</PERSON> said.
   <ORGANIZATION>Tehran Radio</ORGANIZATION>, monitored by the <ORGANIZATION>BBC</ORGANIZATION>, reported other protests
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE> in <LOCATION>Kashan</LOCATION>, southeast of the holy city of <LOCATION>Qom</LOCATION>, and
Firuzukh, east of <LOCATION>Tehran</LOCATION>.
   Six people were killed and 82 injured when police opened fire
<DATE>Sunday</DATE> on demonstrators against the book who stormed a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> cultural
center in <LOCATION>Islamabad</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>. One person was killed in another
protest <DATE>Monday</DATE> in northern <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Times</ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON>Moulana</PERSON> led the demonstration in <LOCATION>Islamabad</LOCATION> and
headed the movement to have the book banned in <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>.
   On <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Tehran Radio</ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON>Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini</PERSON> as
saying <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> and his publishers ``are hereby sentenced to death.''
   ``I call on all zealous Moslems to execute them quickly, wherever
they find them, so that no one will dare to insult Islamic
sanctity,'' it quoted <PERSON>Khomeini</PERSON> as saying.
   Rushdie _ a Moslem born in <LOCATION>Bombay</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>, and educated at
<LOCATION>Cambridge</LOCATION> _ was reported to be under police guard <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> with his
wife, American novelist <PERSON>Marianne Wiggins</PERSON>.
   In <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, spokesman <PERSON>Paul Slovak</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Viking Penguin Inc.</ORGANIZATION> read a
statement representing ``the agreed joint position by the publisher
<PERSON>Viking</PERSON> and the author <PERSON>Salman Rushdie</PERSON>.''
   It said events in <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and threats made against
<PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> and others ``led us to conclude that the current climate is
not appropriate for a promotional tour in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> as previously
planned.''
   The statement said no offense was intended in writing or
publishing the book and ended, ``It is also our unalterable position
that freedom of speech, freedom to publish and freedom to read must
be guaranteed internationally.''
   ``The Satanic Verses'' has sold more than 100,000 copies since it
was published in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> in <DATE>September</DATE> to critical acclaim.
   At least five countries have formally banned the novel: <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Bangladesh</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>.
   Christian <PERSON>Bourgois</PERSON>, a French publishing house that bought the
rights to the novel, said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> it was delaying publication.
   Britain recently reopend its embassy in <LOCATION>Tehran</LOCATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION>Foreign
Office</ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON>Browne</PERSON> was seeking a meeting with Iranian authorities to
clarify the situation.
   Foreign Minister <PERSON>Ali Akbar Velayati</PERSON> told diplomats in <LOCATION>Tehran</LOCATION> the
government would order the closure of cultural centers of nations
that permit publication of the book, <ORGANIZATION>Tehran Radio</ORGANIZATION> reported.
   ``There has been no direct impact on ties so far,'' <ORGANIZATION>IRNA</ORGANIZATION> said
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, ``but by being the first to allow the book to be
published on its soil, <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> could pay a heavy price for ignoring
the strong sentiments of over <MONEY>1 billion</MONEY> Moslems worldwide.''
   <PERSON>Mostafa Barzegar</PERSON>, spokesman for <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION>'s Culture and <ORGANIZATION>Islamic
Guidance Ministry</ORGANIZATION>, announced a ban on books published by Viking and
other imprints of the <ORGANIZATION>Penguin Group</ORGANIZATION>, and said <PERSON>Penguin</PERSON>'s invitation
to the second <ORGANIZATION>Tehran International Book Fair</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>May</DATE> has been
canceled, <ORGANIZATION>IRNA</ORGANIZATION> said.
   Playwright <PERSON>Harold Pinter</PERSON> led a delegation to Prime Minister
<PERSON>Margaret Thatcher</PERSON>'s residence at 10 Downing St. to deliver a letter
denouncing the Iranian threats.
   ``Salman Rushdie lives in this country and must be given full
protection, along with the other people involved,'' said the letter,
whose signatories included authors <PERSON>Fay Weldon</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Marina Warner</ORGANIZATION> and
<PERSON>Hanif Kureishi</PERSON>, publisher <PERSON>Liz Calder</PERSON> and <PERSON>Stuart Weir</PERSON>, publisher of
the left-leaning New Statesman magazine.
   In The <LOCATION>Netherlands</LOCATION>, opposition lawmakers appealed to Foreign
Minister <PERSON>Hans</PERSON> van den Broek to cancel a planned trip to <LOCATION>Tehran</LOCATION>.
   Police were posted outside <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>'s home and the office of his
publisher, Viking, and <PERSON>Kureishi</PERSON> said <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> had gone into hiding.
``He is obviously very frightened,'' said <PERSON>Kureishi</PERSON>. ``These people
are completely nutters,'' said <PERSON>Kureishi</PERSON>, who wrote the script for
the film ``My Beautiful Laundrette.''
   A major character in <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>'s book is named Mahound, a medieval
corruption of the name of the prophet Mohammed. Moslems have
complained the book represents the prophet's wives as prostitutes
and suggests that he wrote the <LOCATION>Koran</LOCATION>, rather than receiving it from
God.
   The title refers to verses which Mohammed removed from the <LOCATION>Koran</LOCATION>,
Islam's holy book, believing they had been inspired by the devil.
   Before he went into hiding, <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> expressed no apologies for
his book.
   ``Frankly, I wish I had written a more critical book,'' he said
in an interview with BBC-TV on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
   ``A religion that claims it is able to behave like this,
religious leaders who are able to behave like this, and then say
this is a religion which must be above any kind of whisper of
criticism, that doesn't add up,'' <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
   <LOCATION>Scotland</LOCATION> Yard's anti-terrorist squad <DATE>today</DATE> said it
was investigating a bomb blast linked to the campaign against <PERSON>Salman
Rushdie</PERSON>, the target of death threats for his novel ``The Satanic
Verses.''
   Police said an anonymous caller, who mentioned <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>'s book,
telephoned with a bomb threat shortly before the device exploded
late <DATE>Sunday</DATE> outside Liberty's department store in central <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>. A
woman passer-by was injured.
   The store was closed at the time, but by day the area is one of
the busiest in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>'s congested West End.
   Until recently, <ORGANIZATION>Liberty</ORGANIZATION>'s housed a Penguin bookstore concession.
``The Satanic Verses'' was published last year under the Viking
imprint, which is part of the Penguin group.
   The novel angered religious Moslems around the world, who claim
it blasphemes their religion.
   Viking Penguin received death threats against its staff after the
Islamic campaign began and two <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> bookstores, one specializing
in Penguin books, were damaged in arson attacks on <DATE>April 9</DATE>.
   ``There used to be a Penguin paperback bookshop in the store, on
the ground floor near the area of our present bookshop, but it
closed a couple of months ago,'' said a spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION>Liberty's</ORGANIZATION>.
   The new bookstore does not stock ``The Satanic Verses,'' she
said, requesting anonymity.
   The injured woman, who was not identified, underwent surgery for
leg injuries and was in satisfactory condition at <ORGANIZATION>University College
Hospital</ORGANIZATION>.
   She is the first person known to have been hurt in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> in the
worldwide campaign by Moslem zealots against the novel.
   Detective chief superintendent <PERSON>Derek Willison</PERSON> said that 10 or 15
minutes before the blast police received an anonymous telephone
warning which mentioned ``The Satanic Verses.'' He would not give
other details.
   As police were searching the area, the bomb went off on the
sidewalk in <LOCATION>Great Marlborough Street</LOCATION> near a window of the Liberty
department store where books were displayed.
   <PERSON>Willison</PERSON> said <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>'s book was not among them, but books issued
by his publishers, <PERSON>Viking Penguin</PERSON>, were in the window.
   Liberty's, established in <DATE>1875</DATE> and housed in a mock Tudor
black-and-white building on the corner of <ORGANIZATION>Regent Street and Great
Marlborough Street</ORGANIZATION>, has an international reputation as a fashion
leader in textiles.
   <PERSON>Willison</PERSON> described the bomb as ``small'' and other police
officers said there was no damage to buildings. But <PERSON>Tracy Ryan</PERSON>, 23,
who was looking in a store window across the street spoke of a large
blast.
   ``Suddenly there was a huge bang. It was really frightening and
the pavement (sidewalk) shook. It was a terrible bang,'' she said.
   Early today, police sealed off the area around the store and were
checking for clues and taking photographs. They finally left at <TIME>5
a.m.</TIME>, removing barrier tapes. There was a bloodstain on the sidewalk
where the woman was injured.
   Rushdie has been in hiding since <DATE>February</DATE>, when <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION>'s late
religious leader, <PERSON>Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini</PERSON>, called on Moslems
worldwide to kill him for his novel allegedly blaspheming Islam. Two
Iranian clerics have offered a <MONEY>$5.2 million</MONEY> bounty for <ORGANIZATION>Rushdie</ORGANIZATION>'s
death.
   Rushdie's American wife, <PERSON>Marianne Wiggins</PERSON>, has said she left him
five weeks ago because she could not stand the strain.
   Moslems in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> have burned the novel and demonstrated against
it. In <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>, at least a score of people have been
killed and hundreds injured in riots protesting the book.
   In the novel, prostitutes are named after the wives of the
prophet Mohammed prophets and that <PERSON>Mohammed</PERSON> wrote the <LOCATION>Koran</LOCATION>, Islam's
holiest book, instead of receiving the words from <LOCATION>Allah</LOCATION>.

   Moslem fundamentalist leaders in <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> said <DATE>today</DATE>
that suicide squads were preparing to carry out the ``death
sentence'' imposed on novelist <PERSON>Salman Rushdie</PERSON> and his publishers by
<PERSON>Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini</PERSON>.
   The declaration on <ORGANIZATION>Tehran Radio</ORGANIZATION> followed other reports that death
squads from Islamic countries were en route to <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> in search of
the writer, whose novel ``The Satanic Verses'' has outraged many
Moslem fundamentalists.
   <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>, which reopened its embassy in <LOCATION>Tehran</LOCATION> in <DATE>December</DATE> for the
first time in eight years, condemned the threats and announced it
had frozen plans to ``build up further our embassy.''
   <ORGANIZATION>United News of India</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>British Broadcasting Corp.</ORGANIZATION> said
telephone callers threatened to bomb British planes to <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> unless
<PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> appeared in public. Two airlines, <ORGANIZATION>British Airways</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Air
Europe</LOCATION>, said they were taking the threat seriously.
   The Indian news agency said a man claiming to speak for the
previously unheard of <ORGANIZATION>Iranian Guards</ORGANIZATION> telephoned its <LOCATION>Bombay</LOCATION> office
today with the threats.
   <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>'s government demanded the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> ban
the book and that all copies of it be destroyed. Six people died in
<LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> during a weekend riot over the book.
   An Iranian cleric on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> offered up to <MONEY>$2.6 million</MONEY> for
<ORGANIZATION>Rushdie</ORGANIZATION>'s murder, and the author canceled a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> promotional tour
that was scheduled to begin <DATE>Friday</DATE>.
   A leading Islamic theologian in <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION> said <DATE>today</DATE> <PERSON>Khomeini</PERSON> erred
in sending death squads after <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> without first giving him a
chance to repent. Sheik <PERSON>Mohammed Hossam-el-Din</PERSON> said the book should
be banned and burned, but executing its author would be ``virtually
impossible'' under the tenets of Islam.
   British news media said the Indian-born <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> was hiding with
his wife, American novelist <PERSON>Marianne Wiggins</PERSON>, under police guard.
Press Association, the domestic British news agency, said <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>'s
first wife, <PERSON>Clarissa Luard</PERSON>, also had been given police protection.
   <ORGANIZATION>Tehran Radio</ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION>Cyprus</LOCATION>, said religious figures in the
northwestern Iranian city of <LOCATION>Urumiyeh</LOCATION> declared in a statement:
   ``We have already put on our death shrouds and pledge to carry
out the Imam's (<ORGANIZATION>Khomeini</ORGANIZATION>'s) death sentence against <PERSON>Salman Rushdie</PERSON>
and his publishers in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>.''
   Iran's lone diplomat in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Mohammed Basti</PERSON>, was summoned to
the <ORGANIZATION>Foreign Office</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> to discuss the situation and emerged
defiant, telling reporters <PERSON>Khomeini</PERSON>'s ``decree or verdict'' had been
delivered ``after careful consideration.''
   ``It has nothing to do particularly with your country,'' the
charge d'affaires said.
   The Foreign Office called <PERSON>Khomeini</PERSON>'s statement ``totally
unacceptable.''
   ``We recognize that Moslems and others may have strong views
about the contents of <PERSON>Mr. Rushdie</PERSON>'s book,'' it said in a statement.
``However, no one has the right to incite people to violence on
British soil or against British citizens.''
   Rushdie, 41, was born into a Moslem family in <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> but is a
British citizen. Since ``The Satanic Verses'' was published in
<LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> in <DATE>September</DATE>, it has sold more than 100,000 copies here and
received critical acclaim.
   <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Foreign Ministry</ORGANIZATION> said today protests were being filed
in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> seeking a ban on the novel.
   Pakistani fundamentalist leaders called for nationwide protests
<DATE>Friday</DATE> to condemn the book and denounce the deaths and injuries in
<DATE>Sunday</DATE>'s protests by Moslem fundamentalists demanding ``The Satanic
Verses'' be pulled from <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> shelves.
   The book has been banned in countries with large Moslem
populations, including <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>, as well as most
Islamic nations, including <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Bangladesh</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>.
   No official ban has been announced in <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION>, where the population
is overwhelmingly Shiite Moslem, but most foreign publications have
been banned in that country for years.
   In <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, a statement issued on behalf of author and publisher
said ``the current climate is not appropriate for a promotional tour
in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>.'' The statement said: ``We reiterate that no
offense was intended in the creation or publication of this work.''
   The French publishing house <PERSON>Christian Bourgois</PERSON> said it was
delaying publication of the novel to avoid risk to the company, its
clients and readers.
   One of <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>'s leading publishing companies, <ORGANIZATION>Arnoldo Mondadori
Editore SpA</ORGANIZATION>, announced today it will go ahead with next week's
planned release of ``The Satanic Verses.''
   Iran's official <ORGANIZATION>Islamic Republic News Agency</ORGANIZATION> reported <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>
that a senior Moslem clergyman in <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Hojatoleslam Hassan Saneie</PERSON>,
had offered <MONEY>$2.6 million</MONEY> to any Iranian who kills <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> and <MONEY>$1
million</MONEY> to a foreigner who kills the author.
   <ORGANIZATION>Tehran Radio</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>today</DATE> that <PERSON>Mohammad Hashemian</PERSON>, the religious
leader in the southeastern city of <LOCATION>Kerman</LOCATION>, pledged another <MONEY>$2.6
million</MONEY> reward.
   A major character in the novel is named Mahound, a medieval
corruption of the name of the prophet Mohammed. Moslems have
complained the book represents the prophet's wives as prostitutes
and suggests that he wrote the <LOCATION>Koran</LOCATION>, rather than receiving it from

   Iran called on Moslem officials
attending a conference here <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> to support <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION>'s decision to
break relations with <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> and call for the execution of author
<PERSON>Salman Rushdie</PERSON>.
   But the <LOCATION>Saudi Arabian</LOCATION> foreign minister, who is chairman of the
46-member <ORGANIZATION>Organization of Islamic Conference</ORGANIZATION>, said he believed the
organization would only denounce <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> and his book, ``The Satanic
Verses.''
   ``<LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> was honored to have broken ties with the leader of the
plot,'' <PERSON>Mohammad Taskhiri</PERSON>, head of <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION>'s delegation, said referring
to <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> in a speech at the foreign ministers' conference.
   Taskhiri urged all Islamic governments to stand united against
what he described as ``these mean attempts to offend the image of
the <PERSON>Prophet Mohammed</PERSON>, his wives and daughters.''
   ``If we are silent now, the West will make a film and then a
video'' of ``The Satanic Verses,'' he said.
   ``We demand that the punishment decreed by Allah be meted out on
that apostate (Rushdie). We also demand that all Islamic countries
boycott <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> culturally and, if that doesn't work, then
politically and economically.''
   The punishment <PERSON>Taskhiri</PERSON> referred to was a fatwa, or religious
ruling, issued by the Iranian leader, <PERSON>Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini</PERSON>,
ordering <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>'s execution for blasphemy.
   Iranian clerics later offered up to <MONEY>$5.2 million</MONEY> to anyone who
killed the 41-year-old author, who was born into a Moslem family in
<LOCATION>India</LOCATION>, but who later moved to <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>, where he has been under
police guard since the death threat.
   The Saudi Arabian foreign minister, <PERSON>Prince Saud al-Faisal</PERSON>, told
reporters:
   ``The conference examined the insufferable affronts and
distortions of Islam in <LOCATION>Rushdie</LOCATION>'s book, which has been strongly
condemned and denounced.''
   He indicated the conference could not condone <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION>'s order to
kill <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> and punish <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> for protecting him.
   He said the conference attaches great importance to the ``spirit
of harmony between all world civilizations and countries.''
   In <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>'s novel, the archangel <PERSON>Gabriel</PERSON> is depicted as an
Indian movie star. A scribe claims he altered the words of the holy
Koran _ considered the word of God _ without the prophet noticing.
And a whorehouse triples its business when its 12 women take on the
identities of the prophets' wives.
   At least 19 people have been killed in anti-Rushdie protests in
<LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>, and the book has been banned in those countries
and others, including <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Bangladesh</LOCATION>.
   In <LOCATION>Peshawar</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>, on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, a bomb exploded and tore a
two-foot hole in the roof of a <ORGANIZATION>British Council</ORGANIZATION> library. A library
official linked the blast, in which no one was hurt, to Moslem
outrage over <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>'s novel.
   <LOCATION>Sudan</LOCATION> announced <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> it was banning all books written by
<PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> or issued by his publisher, <PERSON>Viking Penguin</PERSON>.
   In an interview earlier <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, <PERSON>Taskhiri</PERSON> insisted that <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>
be judged according to the sharia, or Koranic law _ which he said
requires the death sentence for blasphemy. ``That would be the end
of our request,'' <PERSON>Taskhiri</PERSON> said. ``It is impossible for <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> to
change its basic position on the issue.''
   Conference sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said most
delegates follow another interpretation of the sharia, insisting
that anyone accused of blasphemy be given a fair trial and an
oppportunity to repent.
   Islamic theologians meeting in <LOCATION>Mecca</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Saudi Arabia</LOCATION>, the holiest
shrine of Islam, issued a declaration <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> supporting that
interpretation.
   Several delegates were trying to work out a compromise between
<LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> and the more liberal group led by <LOCATION>Saudi Arabia</LOCATION>, the sources
said.

<TEXT>
   <PERSON>Salman Rushdie</PERSON>, born in <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> to a Moslem family,
has ignited fires of protest among Moslems worldwide with his
prize-winning novel, ``The Satanic Verses,'' a story about the
eternal conflict between good and evil.
   The novel takes its name from the verses the Prophet Mohammad
removed from Islam's holy book, the <LOCATION>Koran</LOCATION>, on grounds they were
inspired by Satan.
   Moslem critics _ whom <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> has called fundamentalist
extremists _ say the book is blasphemous and have protested from
<LOCATION>London</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>New Delhi</LOCATION>.
   On <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, five people died and at least 80 were wounded when
police fired on a crowd of protesters outside a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> government
office in <LOCATION>Islamabad</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>, who were demanding that the <LOCATION>United
States</LOCATION> ban the book.
   The novel's protagonists are an Indian movie star and a British
TV personality, both passengers who fall from an airliner blown up
by terrorists en route from <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>.
   They are presumed dead but they survive, or are reborn, and take
on the attributes of the angel <PERSON>Gabriel</PERSON> and Satan.
   Rushdie denies that his novel attacks the Islamic religion, which
he says has been of central importance to him all his life. He said
it deals with ``migration, metamorphosis, divided selves, love,
death, <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Bombay</LOCATION>.''
   He said the disputed passage concerning a prophet living in a
fantastic city of sand which dissolves when water falls upon it,
happens in a dream -- ``the fictional dream of a fictional character
... and one who is losing his mind at that. How much further from
history could one get?''
   The novel was first published in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> in <DATE>September</DATE> and got
generally good reviews but it was banned in <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and some Arab
countries. Moslem religious leaders in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> condemned it as a
``deliberate attack on a faith and its founders.''
   Moslems threatened to boycott bookshops stocking it and some
shops, frightened by demonstrators, removed it from their shelves.
   British writers protested the attacks and playwright <PERSON>Tom
Stoppard</PERSON>, poet <PERSON>Stephen Spender</PERSON> and novelist <PERSON>Kingsley Amis</PERSON> were among
a number who cabled Indian Prime Minister <PERSON>Rajiv Gandhi</PERSON> protesting at
the ban.
   In <DATE>November</DATE>, the book won the ``new novel'' category in the
annual literary competition sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION>Whitbread</ORGANIZATION> brewing
giant, but it did not win the overall <ORGANIZATION>Whitbread</ORGANIZATION> prize, which went in
<DATE>January</DATE> to a first novel by another writer.
   The Guardian, <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>'s liberal daily, on <DATE>Monday</DATE> quoted <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> as
saying he was ``very upset'' at the deaths in <LOCATION>Islamabad</LOCATION> on <DATE>Saturday</DATE>
and he felt that leaders of <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>'s religious parties were
whipping up emotion.
   Rushdie was quoted as saying: ``The thing that is most disturbing
is that they are talking about a book that doesn't exist. The book
that is worth killing people for and burning flags for is not the
book that I wrote. The people who demonstrated in <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> and who
were killed haven't actually read the book because it isn't on sale
there.''
   Rushdie is 41 and a British citizen. He grew up in <LOCATION>Bombay</LOCATION>, came
to <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> at age 14 and won honors for history studies at <ORGANIZATION>Cambridge
University</ORGANIZATION>.
   He has six books behind him, including three prize-winning
novels, ``Midnight's Children,'' ``Shame'' and ``The Satanic
Verses,'' and ``The Jaguar Smile'' about his travels in <LOCATION>Nicaragua</LOCATION>.

   Mahound is a businessman who decides to start a new religion in
the city of <LOCATION>Jahilia</LOCATION>. Only problem, Jahilia already has 360 gods and
doesn't need another.
   But the head of the ruling council proproses a deal: If <ORGANIZATION>Mahound</ORGANIZATION>'s
Allah (the Islamic god) will accept three of the local gods _ Lat,
Uzza and Manat _ as archangels in his sect, he can have his religion
and also a seat on the council. He takes the deal.
   Mahound appears in a dream sequence in the <PERSON>Salman Rushdie</PERSON> book,
``The Satanic Verses.'' He represents Mohammed, revered by Moslems
as the prophet who set down <ORGANIZATION>Allah</ORGANIZATION>'s revelations in the <LOCATION>Koran</LOCATION>,
Islam's holy book. And the novel's portrayal of Mahound-Mohammed _
as a womanizer, a moral coward willing to compromise his faith for
general acceptance, a conniving businessman who makes up laws to
suit his own purposes _ has inflamed the Islamic world.
   ``The Satanic Verses'' is a dizzying 547-page journey through
countless plots, sub-plots, satire and philosophical questions.
   Lyrical, scathing, inquisitive and, at times, bewildering, the
novel's subjects include society's preconceptions of good and evil,
the British treatment of illegal aliens, the desire by Indians to
become assimilated in British culture and, most notably, the birth
of the Islamic faith.
   Rushdie, a 41-year-old native of <LOCATION>Bombay</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>, who now lives in
<LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, writes in a stream-of-consciousness style that leaves the
reader alternately exhilirated, bewildered and _ depending on one's
religious and political orientation _ outraged.
   The book opens with the bombing of a jumbo jet by terrorists. Two
of the passengers _ <PERSON>Gibreel Farishta</PERSON>, an Indian actor who
specializes in religious roles, and <PERSON>Saladin Chamcha</PERSON>, a radio star _
manage to survive by literally falling from the sky. Once they land,
<ORGANIZATION>Gibreel</ORGANIZATION> assumes an ``angelic glow'' and <PERSON>Saladin</PERSON> grows horns and
hooves.
   The book's second, fourth, and sixth chapters, ``Mahound,''
``Ayesha'' and ``Return to Jahilia,'' contain the most controversial
elements involving <ORGANIZATION>Gibreel</ORGANIZATION>'s dream sequence.
   During the dream, <ORGANIZATION>Mahound</ORGANIZATION> has a revelation in <ORGANIZATION>Gibreel</ORGANIZATION>'s presence
telling him to accept the deal. But he soon learns that the
supposedly divine message did not come from <PERSON>Gibreel</PERSON> (the archangel)
but from the Devil, who had been impersonating him.
   Mahound renounces the satanic ``verses.'' He and his followers
settle in the ``friendly oasis'' of Yathrib, just as Mohammed
journeyed from <LOCATION>Mecca</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Medina</LOCATION>. There Mahound dictates to a Persian
scribe named Salman the rules of the new religion as prescribed by
<ORGANIZATION>Gibreel</ORGANIZATION>. But Salman doubts these ``revelations'' because God sounds
too much like a businessman.
   Convinced that <ORGANIZATION>Mahound</ORGANIZATION> is making up the rules himself, <PERSON>Salman</PERSON>
decides to test his leader by deliberately changing what is recited
to him:
   ``Here's the point: Mahound did not notice the alterations. So
there I was, actually writing the Book, or rewriting, anyway,
polluting the word of God with my own profane language. But, good
heavens, if my poor words could not be distinguished from the
Revelation by God's own Messenger, then what did that mean? What did
that say about the quality of the divine poetry? Look, I swear, I
was shaken to my soul.''

   A Nonbeliever's Lesson for the Holidays

   YOUGHAL, Ireland -- Content, as many nonbelievers are, to
spend at least one day a year going through the motions of
religious observance in a church, I spent an hour on
Christmas morning in St. Mary's, reflecting upon tolerance
and the injuries inflicted by fanaticism.
   The stones of St. Mary's Collegiate Church here in this
old town, halfway along Ireland's south coast, speak
eloquently enough on the topic of toleration and its absence.
The church was founded in the 11th century, re-edified by
Thomas, eighth Earl of Desmond in 1468, then pillaged by his
descendant, the 16th earl, in the Geraldine revolt in 1579.
The 16th earl, insurgent against the Norman occupiers,
supposedly stabled his horses in the church, though this
could well have been Norman propaganda.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In <DATE>1649</DATE> <PERSON>Oliver Cromwell</PERSON>, subduing <LOCATION>Catholic Ireland</LOCATION>,
quartered his army in <LOCATION>Youghal</LOCATION> and was greeted by the prudent
townsfolk with the same enthusiasm with which they
subsequently welcomed the return to the throne of Charles II.
When I was growing up the Protestant congregation was sparse,
mustering under a hundred even at <LOCATION>Christmas</LOCATION>, in a place that
could hold over a thousand.
   As I listened, this <DATE>Christmas</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME>, to triumphant
recitations from scripture about the birth of the Christ
child, my thoughts were mostly on a triumph scored not by
Christianity but by Islam.
   On Christmas Eve came news that seemed to suggest that the
fatwa, or sentence of death decreed by the late <PERSON>Ayatollah
Khomeini</PERSON> against the novelist <PERSON>Salman Rushdie</PERSON> for blasphemy,
had taken its toll.
   In <ORGANIZATION>Britain Hesham el Essawy</ORGANIZATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>Islamic
Society</ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION>Promotion of Religious Tolerance</ORGANIZATION>, announced
that "<PERSON>Salman Rushdie</PERSON> has now embraced the Islamic faith for
the first time. That means that under Islamic law the slate
must be wiped clean and his past sins forgiven." <PERSON>Mr. Essawy</PERSON>,
a dentist by profession and critical of the fatwa, was
careful to add that "some people are suggesting that <PERSON>Mr.
Rushdie</PERSON> has issued such a statement now to save his skin, but
I know that he is a man whose arm cannot be twisted. What he
says is what he believes. I also know that his conversion was
not accomplished yesterday but two months ago."
   In telephone interviews after this announcement, <PERSON>Mr.
Rushdie</PERSON> was quoted by the Times of <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> for <DATE>Dec. 26</DATE> as
saying (in the reporter's words) that he "accepted that there
is no God but <LOCATION>Allah</LOCATION> and that <PERSON>Mohammed</PERSON> was his last prophet."
<PERSON>Mr. Rushdie</PERSON> said he would not be publishing a paperback
version of "The Satanic Verses" -- the novel that caused
offense in the first place -- and said (in his own words)
that "I declare that I do not agree with any statement in my
novel `The Satanic Verses' uttered by any of the characters
who insult the prophet Mohammed or who cast aspersions on
Islam or upon the authenticity of the Holy Koran or who
reject the divinity of Allah."
   It was not clear the day after <DATE>Christmas</DATE> whether the
mullahs in <LOCATION>Teheran</LOCATION> would say it was fine for <PERSON>Mr. Rushdie</PERSON> to
come out of hiding, but they must be feeling satisfied by his
protestations.
   All in all it was a good couple of days for militant
Islam, since French soldiers serving in the U.S.-led
multinational force in <LOCATION>Saudi Arabia</LOCATION> were unable to conduct
public Christian devotions for fear of offending the Saudis.
British soldiers wanting to partake in Christian services had
-- for similar reasons -- to go to <LOCATION>Bahrain</LOCATION> to do so.
Apparently the American cantonments were sufficiently large
to permit secluded and furtive religious celebration of
Christmas without affront to Islamic propriety.
   My gloom at the toll taken in these instances by the
forces of superstition was deepened by the lesson at that
point being read from the lectern in <ORGANIZATION>St. Mary's</ORGANIZATION>. It was taken
from one of <ORGANIZATION>St. Paul</ORGANIZATION>'s distasteful letters in which the
precepts of a presumptively historical, humane and human
Jesus were perverted into intolerant doctrine. I was reminded
of a letter written by <PERSON>Thomas Jefferson</PERSON> to <PERSON>John Adams</PERSON>:
   "Among the sayings and discourses imputed to him {<PERSON>Jesus</PERSON>}
by his biographers, I find many passages of fine imagination,
correct morality, and of the most lovely benevolence; and
others, again, of so much ignorance, of so much absurdity, so
much untruth and imposture, as to pronounce it impossible
that such contradictions should have proceeded from the same
being. I separate, therefore, the gold from the dross,
restore to him the former, and leave the latter to the
stupidity of some and the roguery of others of his
disciples." Jefferson rightly called <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> "the first
corrupter of the doctrines of Jesus."
   The profile of Jesus I've always found alluring is that of
the human character drawn by <PERSON>Moncure Conway</PERSON>, in his <DATE>1906</DATE>
memoir "My Pilgrimage to the Wise Men of the <LOCATION>East</LOCATION>." Conway
came to the conclusion, after much scholarly study of
Christian texts and their precedents in <LOCATION>Buddhist</LOCATION> and
Zoroastrian writings, that the Jesus of the Gospels and of
<ORGANIZATION>St. Paul</ORGANIZATION> masked a very different historical character:
   "He whom Church traditions have without scriptural warrant
represented as a sort of peasant surrounded by peasant
disciples, was on the contrary a gentleman of local
distinction, enjoying the friendship of high personages,
including <PERSON>Pilate</PERSON> and his wife, and that he gathered around
him a number of anti-sacrifice reformers large enough to
protect him in driving the animals out of the temple." Conway
emphasized that in its original version, <ORGANIZATION>Christ</ORGANIZATION>'s attack on
the moneychangers in the temple ("a legitimate business") was
in fact an assault on the crudities of animal sacrifice. For
<PERSON>Conway</PERSON>, <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> "corrupted the morals of the religious
movement." Paul's "immeasurable crime" was to restore in the
form of Jesus himself the sacrificial victims Jesus drove
from the temple: "It is due to <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> that Christianity rests
upon a human sacrifice."
   Were the narratives about Christ read as though dug up in
<LOCATION>Persia</LOCATION> and related to <LOCATION>Zoroaster</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Conway</PERSON> wrote, "we should
find in them a gentleman, traditionally of high birth,
educated, and in the best sense a man of the world. He eats
and drinks with personages of rank, admires the Greeks,
exalts cosmopolitan <PERSON>Solomon</PERSON> and the `<ORGANIZATION>Gentile</ORGANIZATION>' Queen of Sheba
above the provincial sectarians of his time, and repudiates
priesthood, sacrifices, sabbath, and pharisaic morality. His
familiarity with refined and polite social life appears in
poetic parables and metaphors . . . a lost pearl, masters of
fields and vineyards, wedding garments, royal ambassadors,
precedence at feasts, the fine robe and ring, and the fatted
calf."
   The civilized individual portrayed by <PERSON>Conway</PERSON> was
transmuted into an accouterment of a religion that has
brought untold suffering upon the world, with cruelties
inflicted in the name of Christian love that far outstrip
horrors done in the name of Islam. In this perspective
<ORGANIZATION>Christmas Eve</ORGANIZATION> did not seem an entirely inappropriate day for
<PERSON>Mr. Rushdie</PERSON> to have made his penitential march to the Islamic
equivalent of <LOCATION>Canossa</LOCATION>. In truth, as the poet <PERSON>Lucretius</PERSON> wrote,
"Tantum religio potuit suadere malorum." How great are the
evils that religion has managed to inflict]

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   <PERSON>Salman Rushdie</PERSON>'s novel ``The Satanic Verses'' is
filled with references to the Islamic faith founded by Mohammed.
   Moslems revere Mohammed as the prophet who brought <ORGANIZATION>Allah</ORGANIZATION>'s
revelations in the <LOCATION>Koran</LOCATION>, the holy book of Islam.
   Three main characters in the book are Mahound, the prophet of a
city of sand called <PERSON>Jahilia</PERSON> and recipient of a revelation in which
satanic verses mingle with divine; an Indian movie star, <PERSON>Gibreel
Farishta</PERSON>; and <PERSON>Saladin Chamcha</PERSON>.
   As the book opens, Farishta and Chamcha are passengers on a
hijacked jetliner. The plane blows up. They fall clinging to each
other singing rival songs. Gibreel becomes the archangel <PERSON>Gabriel</PERSON>,
although <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> continues to call him Gibreel, and Chamcha the
devil.
   Locked into conflict, their identities blur.
   In one passage <ORGANIZATION>Gibreel</ORGANIZATION> sees God:
   ``Gibreel's vision of the <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Being</ORGANIZATION> was not abstract in the
least. He saw, sitting on the bed, a man of about the same age as
himself, of medium height, fairly heavily built, with
salt-and-pepper beard cropped close to the line of the jaw. What
struck him most was that the apparition was balding, seemed to
suffer from dandruff and wore glasses. This was not the Almighty he
had expected. `Who are you?' he asked with interest...
   ```Ooparvala,' the apparition answered. `The Fellow Upstairs.'
   ```How do I know you're not the other One,' Gibreel asked
craftily, `Neechayvala, the Guy from Underneath?'''
   Another passage is set in a brothel called The Curtain where
prostitutes adopt the names of some of Mohammed's 12 wives,
including Ayesha and Hafsah.
   ``It was during one of these playful sessions at the end of a
working day, when the girls were alone with their eunuchs and their
wine, that Baal heard the youngest talking about her client, the
grocer, <LOCATION>Musa</LOCATION>. `That one,' she said. `He's got a bee in his bonnet
about the Prophet's wives. He's so annoyed about them that he gets
excited just by mentioning their names. He tells me that I
personally am the spitting image of Ayesha herself, and she's His
<ORGANIZATION>Nib</ORGANIZATION>'s favorite, as all are aware. So there'...
   ``When the news got around <PERSON>Jahilia</PERSON> that the whores of The Curtain
had each assumed the identity of one of Mahound's wives, the
clandestine excitement of the city's males was intense.''
   <PERSON>Charles Eaton</PERSON>, a British scholar and convert to Islam, told The
Guardian newspaper this is one of the most offensive passages to
Moslems _ the ``equivalent offense to presenting the <PERSON>Virgin Mary</PERSON> as
a whore.''
   ``<PERSON>Salman Rushdie</PERSON>, who was brought up in <LOCATION>Islam</LOCATION>, knows exactly
where to put the needle in,'' said <PERSON>Eaton</PERSON>, also known as Hasan
Abdul-Hakim. ``Western readers very often don't see this.''
   Another passage tells of the Persian scribe, <PERSON>Salman</PERSON>, who takes
dictation from the prophet, and begins to add his own inventions:
   ``Little things at first. If Mahound recited a verse in which God
was described as all-hearing, all-knowing, I would write, all
knowing, all-wise. Here's the point: Mahound did not notice the
alterations. So there I was, actually writing the Book, or
rewriting, anyway, polluting the word of God with my own profane
language. But, good heavens, if my poor words could not be
distinguished from the Revelation by God's own Messenger, then what
did that mean? What did that say about the quality of the divine
poetry? Look, I swear, I was shaken to my soul.
   ``It's one thing to be a smart bastard and have half-suspicions
about funny business, but it's quite another thing to find out that
you're right. Listen: I changed my life for that man. I left my
country, crossed the world, settled among people who thought me a
slimy foreign coward for saving their, who never appreciated what I,
but never mind that. The truth is that what I expected when I made
that first tiny change, all-wise instead of all-hearing _ what I
wanted _ was to read it back to the Prophet, and he'd say, What's
the matter with you, <PERSON>Salman</PERSON>, are you going deaf? And I'd say, Oops,
O God, bit of a slip, how could I, and correct myself. But it didn't
happen; and now I was writing the Revelation and nobody was
noticing, and I didn't have the courage to own up. I was scared
silly, I can tell you. Also: I was sadder than I have ever been...''

   Pro-Iranian kidnappers of three Americans
issued a statement <DATE>Thursday</DATE> vowing revenge on author <PERSON>Salman Rushdie</PERSON>
and his publishers for insulting Islam, but did not threaten harm to
the captives.
   The kidnappers, who call themselves Islamic Jihad for the
Liberation of Palestine, made the threat in an Arabic-language
statement delivered to a Western news agency with a photograph of
hostages <PERSON>Alann Steen</PERSON>, <PERSON>Robert Polhill</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jesse Turner</PERSON>.
   They pledged ``revenge on all those who took part in strong and
ferocious campaigns against Islam ... all institutions and
organizations that insulted in one way or another'' the prophet
<PERSON>Mohammed</PERSON> and his family through <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>'s novel ``The Satanic
Verses.''
   Ayatollah <PERSON>Ruhollah Khomeini</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION>'s 88-year-old Shiite Moslem
patriarch, has ordered his followers to kill <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>.
   <PERSON>Steen</PERSON>, <PERSON>Polhill</PERSON> and <PERSON>Turner</PERSON>, kidnapped <DATE>Jan. 24, 1987</DATE>, from the
campus of <ORGANIZATION>Beirut University College</ORGANIZATION>, were shown from the knees up
seated on what appeared to be a bed, looking directly into the
camera.
   Polhill's left arm and hand were thinner than in a picture
released 14 months ago and his left sleeve was pulled up to the
elbow, showing what might be a deformity, but he was smiling.
   Turner, 42, sat on <PERSON>Polhill</PERSON>'s left clad in a striped sweater and
dark trousers. <PERSON>Steen</PERSON>, 49, was on <ORGANIZATION>Turner</ORGANIZATION>'s left in a dark track suit.
   <PERSON>Steen</PERSON>, who is from <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>, taught journalism at the college.
<PERSON>Polhill</PERSON>, 54, of <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, was assistant professor of business and
<PERSON>Turner</PERSON>, of <LOCATION>Boise</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION>, taught mathematics and computer science.
   They and six other Americans are among the 15 Western hostages in
<LOCATION>Lebanon</LOCATION>. Held longest is <PERSON>Terry A. Anderson</PERSON>, 41, chief <LOCATION>Middle East</LOCATION>
correspondent of <ORGANIZATION>The Associated Press</ORGANIZATION>, who was abducted <DATE>March 16,
1985</DATE>.
   Turner's wife, <PERSON>Badr</PERSON>, who knows all three men, said of <PERSON>Polhill</PERSON>'s
arm: ``Maybe it's a shadow in the picture. I'm not aware that he had
a deformity in his left arm and hand.''
   She said the three captives have nothing to do with what the
captors are saying.''
   ``My husband looked fine, but I'm worried about their
psychological well-being,'' <PERSON>Mrs. Turner</PERSON>, who is Lebanese, said in a
telephone interview. ``We're suffering without them.'
   Neither <PERSON>Polhill</PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON>Ferial</PERSON>, nor <PERSON>Steen</PERSON>'s wife, <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> Rose,
could be reached for comment.
   In <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>Charles Redman</PERSON> said,
``We hold the kidnappers fully responsible for the safety and
welfare of all the hostages. The hostages are innocent victims. They
should be freed immediately and unconditionally.''
   In their statement, the abductors said their group had
``persistently sought to find a peaceful settlement to the hostages
issue, in accordance with its principles and to show its good
intentioins in light of international detente.''
   ``But it seems that Imperialism and Zionism consider that Moslems
should go back on their beliefs and principles as if this were the
price of living in the shadow of international detente,'' the
statement said. ``We are going to shatter their dreams and foil
their schemes.
   ``American Imperialism and international Zionism should realize
that by supporting the ugly contents of The Satanic Verses they have
linked the destiny of their interests with the fate that awaits the
so-called Indian author of the book as well as promoters of the
anti-Islam campaign.''
   The captors urged ``Moslems all over the world to stand against
the laws of the jungle so that advocates of these laws would realize
that real human values ... lie in spiritual religions and not in the
jungle's system.''
   Rushdie's book is ``the worst type of insult to Islam's
sacredness in general and the sacredness of ... Islam's prophet in
particular,'' part of a ``serious and wide-ranging programs under
way to strike against Islam because it is the force that fights
moral and humanitarian degeneration,'' the kidnappers said.
   Moslems say ``The Satanic Verses'' blasphemes Islam by portraying
<PERSON>Mohammed</PERSON>'s wives as prostitutes and suggesting he wrote the <LOCATION>Koran</LOCATION>,
the holy book of Islam, rather than receiving it from God.
   An-Nahar, an independent <LOCATION>Beirut</LOCATION> newspaper, said efforts to free
the 15 hostages were undermined by the strain in <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION>'s relations
with the 12-nation <ORGANIZATION>European Economic Community</ORGANIZATION> caused by <PERSON>Khomeini</PERSON>'s
execution order. It did not attribute the report.
   Reaction to <PERSON>Khomeini</PERSON>'s death sentence has been mixed among
Moslems in <LOCATION>Lebanon</LOCATION>.
   Hezbollah, the pro-Iranian group believed to be the umbrella for
Shiite extremists who hold most or all of the hostages, said a
statement <PERSON>Khomeini</PERSON>'s decree was ``just'' and added:
   ``The publication of this book comes against a Zionist background
that manifests malicious intentions scheming to defame Islam. This
is also the purpose of the current campaign in the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION>,
particularly in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>.''
   Hasan <ORGANIZATION>Saab</ORGANIZATION>, adviser to Sunni Moslem grand mufti <PERSON>Sheik Hassan
Khaled</PERSON>, declared: ``Islam does not allow the killing of man without
a trial. The Koran teaches us that the unjustified taking of one
life is tantamount to killing the whole world.''

   <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini</PERSON> on
<DATE>Sunday</DATE> rejected the apology of British writer <PERSON>Salman Rushdie</PERSON> and
exhorted Moslems around the world to ``send him to hell'' for his
novel ``The Satanic Verses.''
   In a statement issued by the official <ORGANIZATION>Islamic Republic News
Agency</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Khomeini</PERSON> said the ``imperialist foreign mass media are
falsely alleging that officials of the <ORGANIZATION>Islamic Republic</ORGANIZATION> said that if
the author of `The Satanic Verses' repents, the execution order
against him would be abolished. This is denied, <PERCENT>100 percent</PERCENT>.
   ``Even if <PERSON>Salman Rushdie</PERSON> repents and becomes the most pious man
of time it is incumbent on every Moslem (to) employ everything he's
got, his life and wealth, to send him to hell,'' <PERSON>Khomeini</PERSON> was quoted
as saying.
   Khomeini, patriarch of the Islamic revolution, last week
sentenced <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> to death for his novel, which Moslems say insults
Islam.
   But Iranian President <PERSON>Ali Khamenei</PERSON>, allied with so-called
pragmatists led by parliament speaker <PERSON>Hashemi Rafsanjani</PERSON>, sought to
defuse the crisis <DATE>Friday</DATE> by saying <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>'s life would be spared if
he apologized and repented.
   Rushdie, in hiding under the guard of <LOCATION>Scotland</LOCATION> Yard, issued an
apology <DATE>Saturday</DATE>.
   Khomeini's latest statement appeared to leave no room for a
negotiated settlement of the issue, which has put <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s newly
restored relations with <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> in jeopardy.
   A bounty of <MONEY>$5.2 million</MONEY> has been put on <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>'s head by
Iranian religious leaders since <PERSON>Khomeini</PERSON> issued the death sentence.
   In his message <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, <PERSON>Khomeini</PERSON> also called on non-Moslems to
help carry out the death sentence against <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>.
   ``If a non-Moslem becomes aware of his whereabouts and has the
ability to execute him quicker than a Moslem, it is incumbent on
Moslems to pay a reward or a fee in return for this action,'' the
statement said.
   Neither <PERSON>Khomeini</PERSON>'s statement nor <ORGANIZATION>IRNA</ORGANIZATION> referred to the president's
offer of a reprieve, reflecting a widening rift in the Iranian
hierarchy over the <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> affair.
   In <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION>British Foreign Office</ORGANIZATION> said: `We
heard of this report with great concern. We shall be considering
carefully its implications.
   ``This subject will, of course, be discussed in <LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION> by the
Foreign Affairs Council'' on <DATE>Monday</DATE>, when Foreign Secretary Sir
<PERSON>Geoffrey Howe</PERSON> is to raise the issue, the spokesman said. He spoke on
condition of anonymity in keeping with British practice.
   The 41-year-old <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>, born to a Moslem family in <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>, has
not been seen in public since <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, two days after <PERSON>Khomeini</PERSON>'s
first decree.
   In his apology issued through an agent, <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> said: ``As author
of `The Satanic Verses' I recognize that Moslems in many parts of
the world are genuinely distressed by the publication of my novel. I
profoundly regret the distress that publication has occasioned to
sincere followers of Islam.''
   Moslems say ``The Satanic Verses'' blasphemes their religion by
portraying the prophet <PERSON>Mohammed</PERSON>'s wives as prostitutes and
suggesting that he wrote the <LOCATION>Koran</LOCATION>, the holy book of Islam, rather
than receiving it directly from God.
   ``The Satanic Verses'' is banned in <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Bangladesh</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>.
   Publishers in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Greece</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Turkey</LOCATION> have
decided not to publish the book, and some bookstore chains in the
<LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> have pulled it from their shelves.
   In <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, a spokesman said <PERSON>Cardinal John J. O'Connor</PERSON>
criticized both ``The Satanic Verses'' and those who threaten its
author, and implied Catholics should avoid reading the novel.
   ``He (O'Connor) encourages everyone not to dignify the
publication of this work, which has been viewed by Moslems as highly
sacrilegious and offensive,'' said Msgr. <PERSON>Peter Finn</PERSON>, a spokesman for
the cardinal.
   In <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>, the government decided to allow entry of the book
after a review determined it was not ``hate propaganda'' as defined
by Canadian law, <ORGANIZATION>National Revenue</ORGANIZATION> Minister <PERSON>Otto Jelinek</PERSON> announced.
<LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> had blocked imports of the book after receiving a complaint
from a Moslem group.
   The <ORGANIZATION>European Conference of Foreign Press Associations Sunday</ORGANIZATION>
called <PERSON>Khomeini</PERSON>'s order an ``act of terrorism against freedom of
conscience, of religion and of opinion, values which are held to be
the truest expression of a civil and more human world.''
   Representatives of the group, in <LOCATION>Rome</LOCATION> for a three-day meeting,
sent a telegram to the Iranian ambassador to <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> and to the Holy
See.
   In <LOCATION>Yugoslavia</LOCATION>, the leading Communist Party daily began printing

<HEAD>No Change in Blasphemy Laws, Britain Decides</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s ancient blasphemy laws will not be
changed because it would be difficult and could damage relations
among religious groups, the Home Office Minister <PERSON>John Patten</PERSON> said in
a letter to Moslem leaders on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
   Patten also reiterated the government's lack of authority to ban
<PERSON>Salman Rushdie</PERSON>'s novel, ``The Satanic Verses,'' which many Moslems
believe blasphemes Islam. He stressed the British author's right to
freedom of expression.
   Patten urged the 1 million Moslems and other ethnic groups to
participate more fully in British society, saying no room exists for
separation or segregation.
   Moslems and others want the blasphemy law extended to reflect
<LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s multicultural society. The law covers only Christianity,
specifically the Church of <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>, and has been used in courts only
twice in the past 67 years.
   ``The difficulties in redefining what should or should not be
blasphemous would be immense,'' <PERSON>Patten</PERSON> wrote.
   ``Should protection be extended to all faiths, including the very
minor or very obscure? Should it extend only to faiths believing in
one God? Or to major or mainstream faiths only? I believe there is
no equitable, just or right answer to these questions.''
   <PERSON>Patten</PERSON> said the government also feared ``a rush of litigation
which would damage relations between faiths.''
   He said Christians no longer rely on the law, ``preferring to
recognize that the strength of their own belief is the best armor
against mockers and blasphemers.''
   <PERSON>Patten</PERSON> acknowledged the continuing controversy over ``The Satanic
Verses,'' and said the government ``understands how much hurt and
anxiety that book has caused, and ... that insults, particularly to
a deeply held faith, are not easily forgotten or forgiven.''
   Rushdie, born into a Moslem family in <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>, has been in hiding
since <DATE>Feb. 14</DATE> when <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION>'s late leader, <PERSON>Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini</PERSON>,
ordered he be killed for blaspheming Islam. Khomeini died on <DATE>June 3</DATE>,
but the death sentence remains.
   Moslems say his book blasphemes Islam by associating the prophet
Mohammed with prostitutes and suggesting that the <LOCATION>Koran</LOCATION>, Islam's
holy book, was <ORGANIZATION>Mohammed</ORGANIZATION>'s invention, not <ORGANIZATION>Allah</ORGANIZATION>'s own work.
   <PERSON>Kalim Siddiqui</PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION>The Moslem Institute</ORGANIZATION>, said the
government ``has learned nothing'' from the controversy.
   ``There is no such thing as absolute freedom of expression or
speech,'' he said. ``We enjoy our freedom within certain limits.''
   He said Moslem leaders will meet to consider a response to
<PERSON>Patten</PERSON>'s letter.
   ``We cannot live in this country together with `The Satanic
Verses' and <PERSON>Salman Rushdie</PERSON>,'' he said. ``They will have to go.''
   <PERSON>Liaqat Hussain</PERSON>, general secretary of the <ORGANIZATION>Council of Mosques</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Bradford</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>, said, ``We will continue to protest and carry on
our campaign within the framework of the law.''

Rushdie's concessions. No pickup</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   A hard-line <LOCATION>Tehran</LOCATION> newspaper today
rejected <PERSON>Salman Rushdie</PERSON>'s efforts to end Moslem anger over his
novel ``The Satanic Verses.'' It said the late <PERSON>Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini</PERSON>'s death edict still stands.
   The British author announced <DATE>Monday</DATE> that he has embraced Islam
and will not allow the book to be published in paperback. He also
pledged that he would no longer seek to have the novel published in
other languages.
   The novel has sold 1 million copies and already been translated
into 15 languages. The book is banned by 20 countries.
   The Abrar daily said in an editorial that ``<PERSON>Khomeini</PERSON>'s historic
edict on <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> is irrevocable even if he (Rushdie) repents.''
   In <DATE>February 1989</DATE>, the Iranian fundamentalist patriarch called on
Moslems to seek out and kill <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> for allegedly blaspheming
Islam in ``The Satanic Verses.'' Iran subsequently offered a <MONEY>$1
million</MONEY> bounty for <ORGANIZATION>Rushdie</ORGANIZATION>'s death.
   Rushdie has been in hiding ever since.
   Rushdie announced his concessions to Moslems in a statement
released in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> by one of several Islamic leaders with whom he
met in secret on <DATE>Monday</DATE>.
   Hesham el-Essawy, president of the Islamic Society for the
<ORGANIZATION>Promotion of Religious Tolerance</ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> had typed the
statement himself.
   Essawy said <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>, who was born to a Moslem family in <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>
and had previously said he did not consider himself a religious
Moslem, now had ``a clean slate'' with the world's estimated 1
billion Moslems.
   But Abrar dismissed <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>'s efforts as part of ``propaganda
maneuvers by the British government aimed at bringing <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> out
of isolation and making Moslems neglect'' <PERSON>Khomeini</PERSON>'s edict.
   Although <PERSON>Essawy</PERSON> said that he and two other prominent Moslem
scholars met with <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>, the newspaper claimed ``no British
Moslem leader ... could confirm any such meeting.''
   Iran severed relations with <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> over the <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> affair,
accusing the <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> government of defaming Islam by allowing ``The
Satanic Verses'' to be published.
   Relations were resumed <DATE>Sept. 27</DATE> after British officials conceded
that <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>'s book offended Moslems and that <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> had no wish to
offend Islam.
   The resumption of relations came amid efforts by Iranian
President <PERSON>Hashemi Rafsanjani</PERSON>, leader of his country's so-called
pragmatists, to build bridges with the West following the <DATE>June 1989</DATE>
death of <PERSON>Khomeini</PERSON>.
   The Iranians have not rescinded <PERSON>Khomeini</PERSON>'s death sentence on
<PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>, claiming it is a religious edict that cannot be revoked.
But <PERSON>Rafsanjani</PERSON> and his supporters have indicated they are prepared
to allow the decree to lapse.
   Abrar's editorial reflected the thinking of hard-line radicals
opposed to <PERSON>Rafsanjani</PERSON>'s drive to boost relations with the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION>'s Arab neighbors, as well as liberalize Iranian society.
   Rafsanjani has largely marginalized the radicals in a power
struggle, but they continue to snipe at him.
   <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> said in a telephone hookup with a news conference <DATE>Monday</DATE>
that it is up to Iranian leaders whether to withdraw the death
sentence. But he added, ``I feel a lot safer tonight than I felt
yesterday.''
   Many Moslems worldwide object to <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>'s use of the names of
the Prophet Mohammed's wives for the prostitutes in his novel and
the implication that <PERSON>Mohammed</PERSON> wrote the <LOCATION>Koran</LOCATION>, Islam's holy book,
instead of receiving it from God.
   Some Moslem leaders in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> were not satisfied with <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>'s
concessions, demanding that hardcover editions of ``The Satanic
Verses'' be removed from bookstore shelves.
   <PERSON>Sher Azam</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Council</ORGANIZATION> for Mosques in <LOCATION>Bradford</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>northern
England</LOCATION>, where the book had been publicly burned, sad:
   ``Until the book is completely removed our campaign goes on.''

<TEXT>
   <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> protested to <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> on <DATE>Thursday</DATE> over <PERSON>Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini</PERSON>'s orders to kill <PERSON>Salman Rushdie</PERSON>, the author of ``The
Satanic Verses,'' and religious students in <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> threatened suicide
attacks on him.
   The bounty for killing the writer was doubled to <MONEY>$5.2 million</MONEY>,
and <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s airlines _ including <ORGANIZATION>British Airways</ORGANIZATION> _ tightened
security following bomb threats against some flights.
   The death threats against <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>, whose book has been denounced
across the Moslem world as blasphemous, were called ``appalling'' by
the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. State Department</ORGANIZATION>. A leading Islamic theologian who opposes
the book said in <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION> that <PERSON>Khomeini</PERSON> erred by not giving <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> a
chance to repent.
   Rushdie, who was born a Moslem in <LOCATION>Bombay</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>, but no longer
practices Islam, is a naturalized Briton whose novel has sparked
violent protests from Islamic fundamentalists. He has canceled a
promotional tour for the book in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and remains in
hiding with his American wife, <PERSON>Marianne Wiggins</PERSON>. Published reports
said they were under police guard in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>.
   Moslems say the allegorical novel offends their faith by
satirizing the prophet <PERSON>Mohammed</PERSON> as fallible; implying that Islam is
not the only true religion; portraying <ORGANIZATION>Mohammed</ORGANIZATION>'s wives as
prostitutes; and suggesting he wrote the <LOCATION>Koran</LOCATION>, rather than
receiving it from God.
   The <ORGANIZATION>British Foreign Office</ORGANIZATION> summoned <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION>'s lone diplomat in
<LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>, told him <PERSON>Khomeini</PERSON>'s threat was ``totally unacceptable,''
demanded special protection for its <ORGANIZATION>Tehran Embassy</ORGANIZATION>, and froze plans
to expand diplomatic relations with the Islamic state.
   ``We recognize that Moslems and others may have strong views
about the contents of <PERSON>Mr. Rushdie</PERSON>'s book,'' British Foreign
Secretary Sir <PERSON>Geoffrey Howe</PERSON> said after his office summoned Iranian
Charge d'Affaires <PERSON>Mohammed Basti</PERSON>.
   ``However, nobody has the right to incite people to violence on
British soil or against British citizens. <PERSON>Ayatollah Khomeini</PERSON>'s
statement is totally unacceptable.''
   Howe stopped short of threatening to break diplomatic relations.
But in an address to a <ORGANIZATION>Foreign Press Association</ORGANIZATION> luncheon he said
``a stable and serious relationship ... will not be possible while
<LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> fails to respect international standards of behavior.''
   Basti emerged from the <ORGANIZATION>Foreign Office</ORGANIZATION> in defiant mood, saying
<PERSON>Rushie</PERSON>'s ``infamous book'' has had ``appalling consequences in some
Islamic countries.''
   ``It is a decree, it is a verdict after careful consideration,''
he said of the death sentence. ``It has nothing to do with any
particular country.''
   On <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, protesters stoned the <ORGANIZATION>British Embassy</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Tehran</LOCATION>.
   Britain reopened the embassy in <DATE>December</DATE> after an eight-year
closure, and intended to appoint an ambassador and have more than 12
diplomats, the <ORGANIZATION>Foreign Office</ORGANIZATION> said.
   In <LOCATION>New Delhi</LOCATION>, an anonymous caller to the <ORGANIZATION>United News of India</ORGANIZATION>
threatened to bomb British flights unless <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> emerged from
hiding.
   At <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Heathrow Airport</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>British Airways</ORGANIZATION> immediately
tightened security with bag-by-bag searches of luggage of passengers
on its <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>evening</TIME> flights to the Indian sub-continent and the
<LOCATION>Far East</LOCATION>.
   Air <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, another British-owned airline with flights to <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>,
said it was taking the threat seriously.
   Amid a growing international furor, the <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> government
called in the British and American ambassadors and demanded that all
copies of the book be destroyed.
   <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and several other countries banned the book.
Prime Minister <PERSON>Benazir Bhutto</PERSON> reached agreement with her right-wing
opposition in <DATE>January</DATE> on a parliamentary resolution upholding the
ban.
   <ORGANIZATION>Tehran Radio</ORGANIZATION> said religious figures in the northwestern <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> city
of <LOCATION>Urumiyeh</LOCATION> said in a statement, ``We have already put on our death
shrouds and pledge to carry out the Imam's (<ORGANIZATION>Khomeini</ORGANIZATION>'s) death
sentence against <PERSON>Salman Rushdie</PERSON> and his publishers in the <LOCATION>United
States</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>.''
   The broadcast followed reports that other death squads were
headed to <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> from Islamic countries in search of <LOCATION>Rushdie</LOCATION>, a
41-year-old Moslem.
   Rushdie dropped out of sight soon after <PERSON>Khomeini</PERSON> announced the
death sentence on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> on him and Viking, his publishers in
<LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>.
   The <MONEY>$2.6 million</MONEY> bounty offered by <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> was matched by <PERSON>Mohammad
Hashemian</PERSON>, religious leader in the southwestern city of <LOCATION>Kerman</LOCATION>, who
offered the cash reward ``to any group or individual who carries out
the death sentence on <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> and his publishers.'' That brought the
total bounty to <MONEY>$5.2 million</MONEY>.
   Non-Iranians would be paid <MONEY>$1 million</MONEY> if they got to Rushdie
first.
   In <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>Charles E. Redman</PERSON> said
the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> was ``appalled by the death threats against <PERSON>Salman
Rushdie</PERSON> by the <PERSON>Ayatollah Khomeini</PERSON>, as well as a subsequent offer of
a reward for his murder.''
   ``Such threats are completely irresponsible and are incompatible
with basic standards of international conduct,'' he said, adding
that he did not see how ``this in any way could improve the
prospects'' for U.S.-Iranian relations.
   In the <LOCATION>Netherlands</LOCATION>, where he is on a <ORGANIZATION>NATO</ORGANIZATION> tour, Secretary of
State <PERSON>James A. Baker III</PERSON> called the death threats ``regrettable.''
   Sheik <PERSON>Mohammed Hossam-el-Din</PERSON>, a leading Islamic theologian in
<LOCATION>Cairo</LOCATION>, said <PERSON>Khomeini</PERSON> erred in sending death squads after <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>
because executing him would be ``virtually impossible'' under the
tenets of Islam.
   Hossam-el-Din said in an interview that nobody has been executed
in <LOCATION>Islam</LOCATION>'s 1,350-year history as an apostate, which he interpreted
as the crime that <PERSON>Khomeini</PERSON> invoked in issuing his sentence against
<PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>. <PERSON>Khomeini</PERSON> said only that the Indian-born author deserved to
die for insulting Islam.
   In other developments:
   _ The French government said it was ``shocked'' at the death
threat and Dutch Foreign Minister <PERSON>Hans van den Broek</PERSON> canceled a trip
to <LOCATION>Tehran</LOCATION>.
   _ Italian publishers <ORGANIZATION>Arnoldo Mondadori Editore Spa</ORGANIZATION> said they
would go head with a contract to release the Italian edition of
``The Satanic Verses,'' but <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>'s French publishers, <PERSON>Christian
Bourgois</PERSON>, suspended publication plans.
   _ The British Arts Council, backing earlier protests by British
writers, denounced the threats against <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> and his publishers as
contrary to the ``tolerance and understanding that are the hallmark
of a free society.''

   Police fired on hundreds of protesters
<DATE>Sunday</DATE> who stormed a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> government office to demand the <LOCATION>United
States</LOCATION> ban a novel they consider offensive to Moslems. At least five
people died and 80 were injured, doctors said.
   Police repeatedly fired semi-automatic weapons, rifles and
shotguns at charging protesters who yelled ``American dogs!'' and
hurled rocks and bricks during three hours of fierce clashes.
   The rioting erupted when more than 2,000 fundamentalists tried to
march to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Information Center to demand the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> ban
``The Satanic Verses,'' an acclaimed novel by <PERSON>Salman Rushdie</PERSON>.
   Pakistan banned the novel on grounds it offends Moslems by
suggesting the prophet <PERSON>Mohammed</PERSON> was fallible. <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> also banned the
novel.
   In <LOCATION>Kennebunkport</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION>, where President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> was spending the
<DATE>weekend</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>Marlin Fitzwater</PERSON> said <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> officials
were monitoring the <LOCATION>Islamabad</LOCATION> situation closely. <PERSON>Fitzwater</PERSON> said the
national security adviser, <PERSON>Brent Scowcroft</PERSON>, telephoned <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> early
<DATE>Sunday</DATE> to tell him of the riot.
   ``God is great!'' protesters screamed as they smashed windows and
started fires after driving off scores of police.
   They tore down the American flag at the center and danced in
delight as it was burned, along with effigies representing the
Indian-born <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> and the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>. ``Hang <PERSON>Salman Rushdie</PERSON>,''
one man yelled.
   Three <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> diplomats and 15 Pakistanis employeed at the center
were in the building at the time but were not hurt, <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> diplomats
said.
   ``There was a pitched battle going on outside,'' said <PERSON>Kent Obee</PERSON>,
head of the center, which contains a public library and dispenses
information about the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>.
   Doctors at area hospitals, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said at least five people had been killed by police gunfire and 65
protesters shot and wounded.
   They said the injured included Moslem theology students and about
20 police hit by rocks or beaten by the rampaging crowd.
   Police arrested at least 65 protesters, and angry officers were
seen beating and kicking some of those arrested. Hospitals reported
at least 80 injuries.
   Some protesters attacked the nearby <ORGANIZATION>American Express</ORGANIZATION> travel
agency, smashing windows and starting a fire before police drove
them off.
   Enraged demonstrators also attacked three Western journalists,
including two <ORGANIZATION>Associated Press</ORGANIZATION> correspondents and an <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>
Constitution correspondent. They were not injured.
   Police in blue helmets and armed with bamboo canes and metal
shields initially tried to disperse the crowds with tear gas and
batons, but the mob hurled the tear gas canisters back and
repeatedly charged police.
   Police fired in the air and then began shooting into the crowd as
protesters advanced. Other officers ran to escape the mob.
   Protest leaders said ``The Satanic Verses'' should be banned in
the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and all other nations.
   ``There are insulting remarks in this book. There are lies in
this book,'' said <PERSON>Mohammad Sadique</PERSON>.
   The novel takes its name from the verses the Prophet Mohammad
removed from Islam's holy book, the <LOCATION>Koran</LOCATION>, on grounds they were
inspired by Satan.
   The novel's protagonists are an Indian movie star and a British
TV personality, both passengers who fall from an airliner blown up
by terrorists en route from <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>.
   They are presumed dead but they survive, or are reborn, and take
on the attributes of the angel <PERSON>Gabriel</PERSON> and Satan.
   Rushdie, who lives in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, denies that his novel attacks the
Islamic religion, which he says has been of central importance to
him all his life. He said it deals with ``migration, metamorphosis,
divided selves, love, death, <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Bombay</LOCATION>.''
   He said a disputed passage concerning a prophet living in a
fantastic city of sand which dissolves when water falls upon it,
happens in a dream _ ``the fictional dream of a fictional character
... and one who is losing his mind at that. How much further from
history could one get?''
   The novel was first published in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> in <DATE>September</DATE>.
   Obee said the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Embassy</ORGANIZATION> had been informed about the march and
that officials expected protest leaders to present a petition asking
that the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> ban the book. Police had been stationed
around the center for hours before the march.
   Some opposition lawmakers and Moslem leaders said police
overreacted and mishandled the situation.
   ``It was a very brutal attack against a peaceful demonstration,''
they said in a joint statement.

FT  08 FEB 93 / Survey of Iran (13): Understanding the problem - Salman
Rushdie
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON <DATE>February 14, 1989</DATE>, <PERSON>Ayatollah Khomeini</PERSON> issued a 'fatwa', or religious
decree, that the author of the book Satanic Verses, <PERSON>Mr Salman Rushdie</PERSON>, had
been sentenced to death. The announcement caused a storm of international
protest and continues to bedevil <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION>'s relations with other countries,
particularly <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Mr Javad Larijani</PERSON>, special adviser on foreign affairs
to President <PERSON>Rafsanjani</PERSON>, explained the <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION>'s attitude to the issue:
'In order to solve this problem you first must really understand it. That is
the key. The <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> case has parallels with all the religions in the world.
It is an issue of blasphemy of the prophets.
'In Judaism and Christianity the verdict is much harsher than in <LOCATION>Islam</LOCATION>. What
<PERSON>Imam Khomeini</PERSON> conveyed is simply what Islam thinks about a man who is guilty
of blasphemy. So why blame <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> when that is how Islam thinks about a
particular case? It is like blaming Jesus Christ for the way in which
Christianity deals with blasphemy. In the <DATE>19th century</DATE> there were cases in
<LOCATION>Rome</LOCATION> and other places when they burned the man who had blasphemed the
prophet.
'If we understand the heart of this matter, then no politician in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>
would ask an Iranian politician to disown the fatwa because it would be like
disowning Islam and the <LOCATION>Koran</LOCATION>. This is not the sort of condition which
British politicians should put on relations with <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION>. It is quite
unreasonable. The only condition put on relations between two countries
should be mutual interest and respect.
'I think in this case perhaps the government in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> is being manipulated.
British politicians are wise enough to know all the tricks of politics. I do
not find it easy to see what benefit there is for <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> by getting into
such a game with <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION>. I think they still do not fully understand in the
west what the meaning of a fatwa is.
'Politicians in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> should not teach us how to understand Islam, in the
same way as we should not teach them how to understand the Leviathan of
Hobbes. Instead we should get down to business, into those areas of mutual
and converging interests in the economic and political spheres that do exist
between us. Let us capitalise on the areas where we converge, rather than
where we diverge.
'The issue of Salman Rushie is sometimes inflated by circles connected to
<LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION>. They are very unhappy with relations between the west and <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION>. I do
not believe in conspiracy theories, but I cannot ignore that <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> does
have a good apparatus for making some issues known to public opinion. They
are strong at that.
'But, anyhow, it is the perceptions which are so different. The west
considers the case like this: the head of a government is pointing his
finger at a man in a foreign country and saying that this man should be
executed because he wrote a book. If this is the type of picture being
presented then it will be not very tolerable for the west.
'From our side the picture is quite different. We consider him (<PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>) as
a man who tried to betray Islam, to downgrade Islam and to downgrade the
sentiments of more than a billion Moslems. So we said only what Islam
expects for that man: that he does not deserve to exist. It's like, for
example, you pointing your finger at Hitler when he was alive and saying
that this man should be tried and executed a hundred times. This does not
mean that you are sending paratroops to execute him.
'The main barrier, if we are to have an honest debate of this issue, is
cultural, and the very deep emotion which blocks real understanding. The key
is to understand the case objectively. Perhaps some debates between
intellectuals, writers and thinkers could be very helpful. But this does not
rest only on our shoulders. This should be done from both sides. It is not
right for <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> to put all the blame on <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION>.'

   ``Rushdie will die soon,'' said a sign carried by a small child,
one of at least 3,000 protesters who marched on a street near the
headquarters of <ORGANIZATION>Viking Penguin Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, the book's <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> publisher.
   ``Salman Rushdie _ die. How much longer will you hide?'' said
another sign, referring to the protection <LOCATION>Great Britain</LOCATION> has given
the author, who lives in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, following death threats from
Islamic fundamentalists.
   At a smaller rally in <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>, about 40 people paraded in a circle
on the Common carrying signs reading ``Blasphemy Does Not Equal
Freedom of Speech, Respect for All Religions.''
   Events in two other cities gave both sides the opportunity to be
heard.
   Writers gathered on the steps of the main <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> library to
denounce the death threats. <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON>Ben Jones</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-Ga.</LOCATION>, invited a
small group of Moslem protesters to the microphone, saying, ``We
have our disagreements, but we respect your freedom.''
   He said later, however, ``The ayatollah and his fanatical
followers can go to hell.''
   On <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> radio station KPFK-FM, <PERSON>William Schallert</PERSON> and other
actors read excerpts from the novel as part of an hourlong program
that also featured authors discussing free speech issues and experts
on Islam explaining why Moslems have condemned the book.
   Moslems from across the country joined the mid-afternoon rally in
<LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION>, and some carried the flags of <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Bangladesh</LOCATION>, all Islamic nations. Demonstrators also carried signs
saying, ``Viking Penguin, we gonna fix you up'' and ``Satanic Verses
Equals Literary Terrorism.''
   Police guarded the publisher's front entrance, watching the
protesters as they listened to the chant ``Allah is great!''
blasting through loudspeakers. No arrests were made, police said.
   ``We support <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>'s death according to the laws of Islam,''
said <PERSON>Mohammed Muwahid</PERSON>, an engineer who works for the city of <LOCATION>New
York</LOCATION> and was born in the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION>West Bank</LOCATION>.
   ``There's a need to take planned action,'' said <PERSON>Shahid Mahmood</PERSON>, a
Pakistani-born investment broker with <ORGANIZATION>Robert W. Baird &amp; Co</ORGANIZATION>.
   Mahmood, of <LOCATION>Pine Brook</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>, said American Moslems are planning
a march on <LOCATION>Washington D.C.</LOCATION> within the next two weeks if Viking
Penguin does not stop publishing and selling <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>'s book.
   At the <ORGANIZATION>Islamic Center of North America</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Plainfield</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ind.</LOCATION>,
officials said <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>'s book is an offense on religion in general,
not just Islam.
   Moslems say the book depicts the Islamic prophet Mohammed through
a blasphemous fictional character and names prostitutes after
<ORGANIZATION>Mohammed</ORGANIZATION>'s wives.
   ``It slurs women of virtue that have been used by one billion
people as models of morality, of family organization and kindness,''
said <PERSON>Dawood Zwink</PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION>Islamic Society of North
America</ORGANIZATION>.
   Rushdie has labeled the book as fiction and apologized for the
distress its has caused. But Iranian leader Ayatollah <PERSON>Ruhollah
Khomeini</PERSON> has stood by the <MONEY>$5.2 million</MONEY> bounty offered for <ORGANIZATION>Rushdie</ORGANIZATION>'s
execution.
   President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Western Europe</LOCATION>'s leaders have condemned the
death threat, and many writers have rallied to support <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>'s
freedom of expression.

<HEAD>Iranian Says All Copies Must Be Burned</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Iran's parliament speaker said <DATE>Friday</DATE>
``The Satanic Verses'' had created history's strangest crisis, and
he offered a simple solution: Burn all existing copies of the book
and ban it forever.
   A dispatch from the official Iranian news agency did not say
whether <PERSON>Hashemi Rafsanjani</PERSON> commented on <PERSON>Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini</PERSON>'s order of <DATE>Feb. 14</DATE> that his followers kill the author,
<PERSON>Salman Rushdie</PERSON>, for blaspheming Islam.
   Unless the novel is destroyed and banned, <PERSON>Rafsanjani</PERSON> said during
<DATE>Friday</DATE> prayers at <ORGANIZATION>Tehran University</ORGANIZATION>, ``it will remain forever a
source of rebellion and it would be impossible that peace would come
between real Moslems and the supporters of this book.''
   He said the solution to ``the strangest and rarest crisis in
history is to issue a strict order to seize all copies in the entire
world and burn them,'' the <ORGANIZATION>Islamic Republic News Agency</ORGANIZATION> reported.
   Rushdie, a naturalized citizen of <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>, was born to Moslem
parents in <LOCATION>Bombay</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>, but has said he no longer practices
religion. The 41-year-old author went into hiding after the <PERSON>Khomeini</PERSON>
pronounced the death sentence and Iranian religious leaders added a
reward of <MONEY>$5.2 million</MONEY>.
   Moslems say a scene in ``The Satanic Verses'' in which
prostitutes take the names of Mohammed's wives, and suggestions that
the prophet wrote the holy Koran rather than receiving it from
<LOCATION>Allah</LOCATION>, blaspheme Mohammed and Islam.
   Most nations in the <LOCATION>Middle East</LOCATION> have banned the book, as have
Asian countries with large Moslem populations. At least 19 people
were killed in riots about it in <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>.
   Iran broke diplomatic relations with <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> because
Prime Minister <PERSON>Margaret Thatcher</PERSON>'s government refused to suppress
the novel.
   She and her foreign minister, Sir <PERSON>Geoffrey Howe</PERSON>, said they
realized <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>'s book offends Moslems but insisted <PERSON>Khomeini</PERSON>'s
execution order be revoked and freedom of expression respected.
   The dispute opened a new rift between <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION>, to which
more moderate elements in <LOCATION>Tehran</LOCATION> had looked for trade and assistance
in rebuilding from the eight-year war with <ORGANIZATION>Iraq</ORGANIZATION>.
   <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s 11 partners in the <ORGANIZATION>European Economic Community</ORGANIZATION>, joined
by <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Norway</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION>, recalled their ambassadors from
<LOCATION>Tehran</LOCATION>. <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> says it will deport nine former <ORGANIZATION>Iranian Embassy</ORGANIZATION>
employees if they do not leave the country within 10 days.
   Rafsanjani was a leader in openings to the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION> and has been
considered the <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION>'s most powerful figure after <PERSON>Khomeini</PERSON>, the
88-year-old revolutionary patriarch.
   He castigated <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> in his speech <DATE>Friday</DATE>. They ``didn't have
the guts to say `We also did wrong, we supported (<PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>), we too
are guilty','' he declared.
   ``Their pride didn't allow them to say the truth. If those who
ignited this flame do not find a suitable solution, who knows where
it will lead?''
   A <LOCATION>Tehran</LOCATION> radio commentary said outrage over ``The Satanic
Verses'' would not abate and warned of ``retaliatory action'' if
<LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> deported the Iranians.
   ``There are currently present in <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> persons who ... are engaged
in spying for <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> and undoubtedly it is <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> who will be the
loser as the result of retaliatory measures,'' the radio said.
   It mentioned British businessmen <PERSON>Roger Cooper</PERSON>, 52, a longtime
resident of <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> jailed in <LOCATION>Tehran</LOCATION> two years ago on espionage
charges. The radio said <PERSON>Cooper</PERSON> had made ``revelations'' about
undercover activities in Islamic countries ``that can greatly
disgrace <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>.''
   In <LOCATION>Turkey</LOCATION>, a secular Moslem state, police detained dozens of
demonstrators <DATE>Friday</DATE> after protests to denounce <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> and his
novel. Protesters chanted ``Down with <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION>!''
and ``Death to Salman Rushdie!''

<DATELINE>ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran says the current
<LOCATION>Middle East</LOCATION> tour of Prince <PERSON>Charles</PERSON> and <PERSON>Princess Diana</PERSON> is a hostile
affront to Moslems who want <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> to ban <PERSON>Salman Rushdie</PERSON>'s novel
``The Satanic Verses.''
   Tehran Radio on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> accused the British government of
trying to exploit the trip and ``give a cold shoulder'' to the
world's Moslems. But it warned that <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> could not avoid facing
``their wrath.''
   On the second day of their official visit to the <ORGANIZATION>United Arab
Emirates</ORGANIZATION> <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, the heir to the British throne and his wife were
steeped in Arab traditions. There was camel racing, sword dancing
and open-air lamb roasting.
   The couple is on an official one-week tour of <LOCATION>Kuwait</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Bahrain</LOCATION> and
the Emirates that was announced last <DATE>June</DATE>. Charles will then fly
alone to <LOCATION>Saudi Arabia</LOCATION> for a private visit.
   <ORGANIZATION>Tehran Radio</ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, noted that the visit was
taking place while the 45-nation <ORGANIZATION>Organization of Islamic Conference</ORGANIZATION>
was meeting in the <LOCATION>Saudi</LOCATION> capital, <LOCATION>Riyadh</LOCATION>, with ``The Satanic
Verses'' at the top of the agenda.
   <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> told conference delegates it was honored to
have broken relations with <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> over the <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> affair. It
reiterated its call for the execution of Indian-born British author
first issued <DATE>Feb. 14</DATE> by fundamentalist patriarch <PERSON>Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini</PERSON>.
   ``Now under such circumstances when the British government has
applied all its resources for inflicting a blow upon Islam and
insulting our prophet, how can the presence of the British crown
prince in Islamic states be justified?'' said a commentary by <ORGANIZATION>Tehran
Radio</ORGANIZATION>.
   Many Moslems say ``The Satanic Verses'' blasphemes Islam by
suggesting the <LOCATION>Koran</LOCATION>, Islam's holy book, was invented by the prophet
Mohammed rather than received directly from God, and for giving
prostitutes the names of <ORGANIZATION>Mohammed</ORGANIZATION>'s wives.

<TEXT>
   <PERSON>Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini</PERSON> expressed his
thanks <DATE>Monday</DATE> to Moslems who supported his order that <PERSON>Salman Rushdie</PERSON>
be killed for writing ``The Satanic Verses.''
   Iranian television quoted a statement from the 88-year-old
patriarch's office as saying it ``was inundated by waves of
telegrams and letters, and pledges of support and readiness to carry
out the Imam's order, most of them from Islamic scholars and leaders
who organized glorious rallies and protests, all of which were
reported to the Imam.''
   ``The Imam expressed his thanks to all the people for their pure
feelings, which tell of hearts full of faith,'' the statement said.
   Khomeini's thanks coincided with the opening of a four-day
conference in <LOCATION>Riyadh</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Saudi Arabia</LOCATION>, of member nations of the
<ORGANIZATION>Organization of Islamic Conference</ORGANIZATION>. Iran wants the meeting to take
action about <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> and ``The Islamic Verses,'' which Moslems
believe blasphemes Islam.
   According to the television, 190 members of <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION>'s parliament
sent a letter to the <LOCATION>Riyadh</LOCATION> conference demanding discussion of the
book and Western support for <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>.
   Arab diplomatic sources said <PERSON>Khomeini</PERSON>'s death threat had not
found support at the conference.
   He issued the order <DATE>Feb. 14</DATE>, directing his followers to hunt down
and kill <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>, and Iranian clerics offered a reward of <MONEY>$5.2
million</MONEY>.
   Rushdie went into hiding. He was born in <LOCATION>Bombay</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>, to Moslem
parents but now is a British citizen and has said he does not
practice religion.
   Moslems say his novel blashphemes Islam in a scene in which
prostitutes are given the names of Mohammed's wives and in its
suggestion that the prophet wrote the holy Koran rather than
receiving it from <LOCATION>Allah</LOCATION>.
   Iran broke diplomatic relations with <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> <DATE>last week</DATE> because
Prime Minister <PERSON>Margaret Thatcher</PERSON>'s government would not suppress the
book.
   Tehran's official <ORGANIZATION>Islamic Republic News Agency</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>Monday</DATE> people
in the African nations of <LOCATION>Niger</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION> support <PERSON>Khomeini</PERSON>'s
action. It said Premier <PERSON>Mamane Oumarou</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Niger</LOCATION> endorsed the
execution order and a Moslem youth group in <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION> had vowed to
bring <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> ``to divine justice.''
   The news agency said two <LOCATION>Tehran</LOCATION> newspapers called for an economic
boycott of <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> and a third recommended breaking relations with
<LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION>.
   According to the latest available figures, <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> imported goods
worth <MONEY>$528 million</MONEY> from <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> in <DATE>1987</DATE> and sold it exports valued
at <MONEY>$321</MONEY>.
   <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION>'s largest book fair opened <DATE>Monday</DATE> in <LOCATION>Jerusalem</LOCATION>, with
100,000 books from 42 countries on display, and ``The Satanic
Verses'' was the main attraction.
   State radio said branches of the <ORGANIZATION>British Council</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION>
removed the <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> book from their lending library shelves, but it
quoted council officials as saying it remained available on request.
   Prime Minister <PERSON>Brian Mulroney</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>, whose government briefly
halted imports of the novel, was in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> on <DATE>Monday</DATE> and said: ``I
expressed to <PERSON>Mrs. Thatcher</PERSON> the view of my government that ... it is
unacceptable for anyone to place a price on the head of a private
citizen for any reason at all, least of all for the expression of a
literary view.''
   President <PERSON>Richard von Weizsaecker</PERSON> of <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION> said <DATE>Monday</DATE>
that religious tolerance should be the starting point of a <LOCATION>Middle
East</LOCATION> peace settlement.
   At a dinner for visiting President <PERSON>Hosni Mubarak</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>, he
acknowledged that <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>'s book had offended Moslems, but said hurt
feelings were not grounds for violation of national sovereignty and
legal rights.
   <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION> is <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION>'s biggest trading partner. Iran imported
<MONEY>$1.3 billion</MONEY> worth of goods from it in <DATE>1987</DATE> and sold <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION>
exports worth <MONEY>$560 million</MONEY>.
   <LOCATION>Bonn</LOCATION> has joined the 12-nation <ORGANIZATION>European Community</ORGANIZATION> in recalling its
envoy from <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> to protest the death sentence, canceled plans for a
Cabinet minister to visit <LOCATION>Tehran</LOCATION> and suspended more than <MONEY>$1 billion</MONEY>
in credits for <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION>.
   Two prominent members of the Swedish Academy, which awards the
Nobel prizes, announced in <LOCATION>Stockholm</LOCATION> they would boycott the academy
to protest its failure to speak out as a body on <ORGANIZATION>Rushdie</ORGANIZATION>'s behalf.
   Author <PERSON>Kerstin Ekman</PERSON>, one of two women in the 18-member academy,
told Swedish television she was dropping ``all work in the academy,
which means in effect I am leaving it.''
   <PERSON>Lars Gyllensten</PERSON>, a former permanent secretary of the academy,
said he would boycott its regular <DATE>Thursday</DATE> meetings but remain on
the administrative committee and Nobel institution.
   Rules of the 200-year-old organization say members are elected
for life and vacate their seats only at death or if they commit a
serious crime.

<TEXT>
   Egyptian author <PERSON>Naguib Mahfouz</PERSON> on <DATE>Thursday</DATE>
urged Moslem countries to condemn <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION>'s call for the assassination
of <PERSON>Salman Rushdie</PERSON> but proposed a boycott against publishers of
<PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>'s book ``The Satanic Verses.'' Mahfouz, who last year became
the first Arab to win the Nobel Prize for Literature, summed up his
views on the controversial book in an article in the state-owned
newspaper Al-Ahram.
   Mahfouz said he wrote the article because some of his remarks to
foreign reporters had been misinterpreted. He said he still has not
read <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>'s book and only recently learned of its contents from
others.
   Iran's leader, <PERSON>Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini</PERSON>, sparked a global
uproar last month by offering a reward for the death of <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>, 41,
an Indian-born British author, on grounds his book blasphemes Islam.
   Interviewed by <ORGANIZATION>The Associated Press</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Feb. 18</DATE>, a few days after
<PERSON>Khomeini</PERSON>'s statement, <PERSON>Mahfouz</PERSON> said he considered the Iranian cleric
guilty of terrorism and that his action had damaged the image of
Islam.
   In <DATE>Thursday</DATE>'s newspaper article, the 77-year-old author said: ``I
believe <PERSON>Khomeini</PERSON> inflicted harm on Islam and Moslems that is not
less, if not more, than what the author of the book intended.
   ``I also have said previously that freedom of opinion should be
sacred and that thought can be rectified only with thought,'' he
said. ``Islam's mission is not terrorism and incitement to murder.''
   Nevertheless, he said he is proposing a three-point plan: the
book's publisher's should be boycotted; Moslem nations should reject
<PERSON>Khomeini</PERSON>'s call to violence; and all nations ``should be called upon
to respect religions and sacred beliefs of peoples without prejudice
to the freedom of research based on scientific standards and subject
to discussion.''
   ``I see now that if <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> bolted with his imagination, the
Moslems misbehaved by staging demonstrations, burning the book and
calling for murder, thus turning the situation upside down and
making the culprit a victim,'' he said.
   Mahfouz said that if reported accounts of the book's contents
were true, ``then the book is not worthy of discussion and its
authorship, like any action overstepping the bounds of law and
ethics, should be fought in the courts or through deterrent measures
at the international level.''
   Moslems have complained that ``The Satanic Verses'' blasphemes
their religion by portraying the prophet <PERSON>Mohammed</PERSON>'s wives as
prostitutes and suggesting that he wrote the <LOCATION>Koran</LOCATION>, Islam's holy
book, rather than receiving it from God through the angel Gabriel.
   Rushdie contends his book is fictional and not blasphemous. He
has apologized for the distress it caused to Moslems but not for its
substance.

<TEXT>
   Arab students who helped sponsor a public
reading of ``The Satanic Verses'' say they may not like author
<PERSON>Salman Rushdie</PERSON>, but they want to show that not all Moslems support
<PERSON>Ayatollah Khomeini</PERSON>'s death decree against him.
   About 300 people attended <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>'s reading and panel
discussion on the <ORGANIZATION>University of Iowa</ORGANIZATION> campus. Twenty-five people read
two-minute selections from the book that many Moslems claim
blasphemes their faith.
   Wan <PERSON>Hasni</PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION>Iowa City Islamic Society</ORGANIZATION> and a
statistics student, said he and other Muslims attended the session
at the <ORGANIZATION>Iowa Memorial Union</ORGANIZATION> ``to hear the views, the feelings of
others in the American community have about this book.''
   ``A demonstration is appropriate if we need one. But it would
have served no purpose to disrupt the reading,'' he said.
   <PERSON>Saadi Simawe</PERSON>, a representative of the <ORGANIZATION>Arab Students Association</ORGANIZATION>
who organized the event, said the reading aimed to demonstrate that
not all Moslems support <PERSON>Khomeini</PERSON>'s action.
   ``Fanaticism is always an aspect of insecurity,'' <PERSON>Simawe</PERSON> said.
``I read the <LOCATION>Koran</LOCATION>, I respect the prophet. I think Islam is a great
religion if taken personally. Once you are going to impose it on
others, it is very dangerous.''
   ``The Koran is not fragile, it is not a (blade) of grass that you
can destroy it by a book. It is a living book,'' said <PERSON>Simawe</PERSON>, a
doctoral student from <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION> studying English and African-American
World Studies.
   <PERSON>Bill Fuhrmeister</PERSON>, director of security at the university, said a
handful of officers stood guard at the reading in case of
disruptions or violence.
   But the only signs of protest were two Islamic Society members
who quietly held large posters defending <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION>'s order that Rushdie
be killed.
   ``Freedom of speech does not mean you can insult one-fifth of
earth's population,'' said a sign held by <PERSON>Mubarak Al-Ajmi</PERSON>, also a
student at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Iowa</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``If someone insults your family, you would stand up and do
something about it. Well, what <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> has insulted is my religion,
which means more to me than even my family,'' <PERSON>Al-Ajmi</PERSON> said.
   <PERSON>Mahmoud Rizig</PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION>Iowa City Islamic Society</ORGANIZATION>, said
he urged his group's members to attend the reading and carry protest
signs but not disrupt the event.
   Rushdie, a British citizen who was born into a Moslem family in
<LOCATION>India</LOCATION>, has been in hiding since <DATE>Feb. 14</DATE>, when Iranian clerics
offered a <MONEY>$5.2 million</MONEY> reward for his death.
   The Writers' Workshop and the International Writing Program at
the university sponsored the reading along with the <ORGANIZATION>Arab Students
Association</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>General Union of Palestinian Students</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Indian
Students' Association</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Pakistani Students Association</ORGANIZATION>.

   Pro-Iranian captors of three American
educators today threatened to take revenge against <PERSON>Salman Rushdie</PERSON>,
the publishers of his novel ``The Satanic Verses'' and their
supporters for insulting Islam.
   Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine delivered the
threat in a hand-written statement accompanied by an instant
photograph of American hostages <PERSON>Alann Steen</PERSON>, <PERSON>Robert Polhill</PERSON> and
<PERSON>Jesse Turner</PERSON>.
   The group did not directly threaten the hostages, who appeared in
a photograph released with the document to prove its authenticity.
   The Arabic-language statement, delivered to the office of a
Western news agency in Moslem west <LOCATION>Beirut</LOCATION>, threatened to ``take
revenge against all those who took part in strong and ferocious
campaigns against Islam.''
   In the photograph, shows the three bearded hostages from the
knees up sitting on what appeared to be a bed and looking straight
into the camera.
   Polhill's left arm and hand are noticeably thinner than in a
picture released 14 months earlier, and his left sleeve appears to
have intentionally been hiked up to the elbow to show the arm.
   The document said the revenge would cover ``all institutions and
organizations that insulted in one way or another'' members of
prophet <PERSON>Mohammed</PERSON>'s family, meaning Moslems.
   European governments have recalled their ambassadors from <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> to
protest <PERSON>Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini</PERSON>'s decree last week that Moslems
seek out and kill <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> and his publishers because ``The Satanic
Verses'' blasphemes Islam.
   Authors have led demonstrations of outrage at the threat from
<LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION>'s fundamentalist patriarch, who has refused to accept <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>'s
apology, and President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> has called the threat an insult to the
civilized world.
   Rushdie, a naturalized Briton who was born a Moslem in <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>, is
in hiding with his wife in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> and reportedly under police
guard. Iranian clerics have offered <MONEY>$5.2 million</MONEY> for <ORGANIZATION>Rushdie</ORGANIZATION>'s
murder.
   <PERSON>Steen</PERSON>, <PERSON>Polhill</PERSON> and <PERSON>Turner</PERSON> were kidnapped <DATE>Jan. 24, 1987</DATE>, from the
campus of the American-affiliated <ORGANIZATION>Beirut University College</ORGANIZATION>, where
they held teaching posts. <PERSON>Steen</PERSON>, 49, of <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>, taught journalism,
while <PERSON>Polhill</PERSON>, 54, of <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, was assistant professor of business
and <PERSON>Turner</PERSON>, 42, of <LOCATION>Boise</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION>, taught mathematics and computer
science.
   The three are among 15 foreigners missing and believed held
hostage in <LOCATION>Lebanon</LOCATION> by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem extremists. Nine of
the hostages are American, including <ORGANIZATION>Associated Press</ORGANIZATION> chief <LOCATION>Middle
East</LOCATION> correspondent <PERSON>Terry Anderson</PERSON>, who was kidnapped <DATE>March 16, 1985</DATE>
and is the longest held.
   ``Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine had persistently
sought to find a peaceful settlement to the hostages' issue, in
accordance with its principles and to show its good intentions in
light of international detente,'' the statement said.
   ``But it seems that imperialism and Zionism consider that Moslems
should go back on their beliefs and principles as if this were the
price of living in the shadow of international detente.''
   The <LOCATION>Beirut</LOCATION> newspaper an-Nahar <DATE>today</DATE> said efforts to free foreign
hostages in <LOCATION>Lebanon</LOCATION> have suffered now that <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> and the 12 <ORGANIZATION>European
Economic Community</ORGANIZATION> nations are at loggerheads over <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION>'s death
threat against <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>.
   Jihad threatened to strike against American and Israeli interests
for supporting <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> and his novel and called on ``Moslems all
over the world to stand against the laws of the jungle so that
advocates of these laws would realize that real human values ... lie
in spiritual religions and not in the jungle's system.''
   It described <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>'s book and the support it has as ``the worst
type of insult against Islam's sacredness.''
   The book was part of ``serious and wide-ranging programs underway
to strike against Islam because it is the force that fights moral
and humanitarian degeneration,'' the statement claimed.
   Many Moslems say <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>'s book blasphemes Islam by portraying
<ORGANIZATION>Mohammed</ORGANIZATION>'s wives as prostitutes and suggesting he wrote the <LOCATION>Koran</LOCATION>,
the holy book of Islam, rather than receiving it from God.
   In <LOCATION>Beirut</LOCATION>, reactions to <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>'s ``The Satanic Verses'' have
been slow and conflicting. An advisor to the Sunni Moslem grand
mufti rejected <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION>'s ruling while the highest Shiite Moslem
religious judge advocated the death sentence.

   Thousands of Moslems on <DATE>Saturday</DATE> fought among
themselves and clashed with police during a march to demand <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>
change its blasphemy laws and allow them to challenge ``The Satanic
Verses'' in court.
   Police said 84 people were arrested and six policemen were
injured during the march, most in street battles in front of the
<ORGANIZATION>Houses of Parliament</ORGANIZATION>.
   An estimated 20,000 demonstrators waved banners denouncing
author <PERSON>Salman Rushdie</PERSON> and shouted slogans such as ``Rushdie must
die!'' as they began their march in <LOCATION>Hyde Park</LOCATION>.
   An effigy of Rushdie hanging from gallows was thrust high into
the air. Rushdie, a British author, wrote ``The Satanic Verses,'' a
novel that some say is insulting to Islam.
   Lawmaker <PERSON>Keith Vaz</PERSON> of the opposition <ORGANIZATION>Labor Party</ORGANIZATION> called on
<PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> and his publisher, <PERSON>Penguin</PERSON>, to withdraw the novel from
circulation in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>, home to an estimated 850,000 Moslems.
   Protesters then marched to Prime Minister <PERSON>Margaret Thatcher</PERSON>'s
office at 10 Downing St., where representatives handed in a
petition demanding a change in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s ancient blasphemy laws.
   <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s rarely used blasphemy law makes it illegal only to
insult the Christian state Church of <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>. Moslems want it
extended to reflect <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s multi-ethnic society, saying this
would give them legal grounds for opposing ``The Satanic Verses.''
   At their next stop in <LOCATION>Parliament Square</LOCATION>, thousands of protesters
stood under <ORGANIZATION>Big Ben</ORGANIZATION> and blocked traffic as fighting broke out among
crowd members. Riot police poured into the area to break up the
clashes and force protesters onto <ORGANIZATION>Westminster Bridge</ORGANIZATION>, out of the
square.
   A <LOCATION>Scotland</LOCATION> Yard spokesman said fighting broke out among younger
members of the demonstration ``for reasons best known to
themselves.''
   He said the demonstrators refused to move but then resumed the
march after protest organizers announced over a loudspeaker that
police had assured them the arrested people would be released.
   After the skirmishes the protesters continued their march to
their final destination in <LOCATION>south London</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Kennington</LOCATION> where they
dispersed.
   Rushdie, born to a Moslem family in <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>, is a British citizen
and has been in hiding in <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> since <DATE>Feb. 14</DATE>, when Iranian
leader <PERSON>Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini</PERSON> ordered Moslems to kill him.
   Moslems say ``The Satanic Verses'' blasphemes Islam by
associating the prophet Mohammed with prostitutes and suggesting
that the <LOCATION>Koran</LOCATION>, Islam's holy book, was <ORGANIZATION>Mohammed</ORGANIZATION>'s invention, not
the work of God.
   At the start of <DATE>Saturday</DATE>'s protest, Moslem men sat in circles on
the grass in <LOCATION>Hyde Park</LOCATION> and punched the air with their fists as they
called for the British government to change the blasphemy law.
   The <ORGANIZATION>International Committee For The Defense of Salman Rushdie</ORGANIZATION>
and <ORGANIZATION>His Publishers</ORGANIZATION> issued a statement calling on demonstration
leaders to repudiate <PERSON>Khomeini</PERSON>'s death threat. The statement said
the death threat violated international law and contradicted ``the
principle of reverence for life which underlies all religions.''
   The committee agreed with the demonstrators that the blasphemy
law discriminated against Moslems and other non-Christians but said
it should be repealed rather than extended.
   The protest was organized by the <ORGANIZATION>British Muslim Action Front</ORGANIZATION> and
Moslem leader <PERSON>Abdal Hussain Choudhury</PERSON>.

<TEXT>
   Author <PERSON>Salman Rushdie</PERSON>, facing calls for his death
and a multimillion-dollar bounty for the killer, today apologized to
Moslems for the distress caused by the publication of his novel
``The Satanic Verses.''
   However, the official Iranian news agency said the author had
failed to repent or order that his book be withdrawn. A Moslem
leader in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> welcomed the apology but said the campaign against
the book would continue.
   In a statement issued by his agent, <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> said: ``I profoundly
regret the distress that publication has occasioned to sincere
followers of Islam.''
   ``Living as we do in a world of many faiths this experience has
served to remind us that we must all be conscious of the
sensibilities of others.''
   The brief statement was also issued to <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Islamic Republic
News Agency</ORGANIZATION>, and a story was sent to <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION>, a spokesman for the
agency said.
   Rushdie apologized after his book was banned in six countries and
removed from the shelves of major bookstores in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>.
   The author's statement came a day after <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION>'s president, <PERSON>Ali
Khamenei</PERSON>, said the Indian-born Briton could save his life with an
apology.
   Iran's news agency noted the apology but said <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>'s statement
``made no indication of his repentence or that his slanderous book
would be withdrawn.''
   IRNA, monitored in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, said <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>, who was raised in a
Moslem family, has been ``under growing pressure to make a public
repentence that his statement is seen falling well short of.''
   Two prominent Moslems condemned the Iranian campaign against the
author, which began <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> when Iranian leader <PERSON>Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini</PERSON> said ``The Satanic Verses'' blasphemed Islam and demanded
zealous Moslems kill <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>. Two Iranian religious leaders later
offered a <MONEY>$5.2 million</MONEY> bounty for Rushdie.
   The Times of <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> today reported that a power struggle may have
prompted <PERSON>Khomeini</PERSON>'s execution order, which sent <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>, 41, and his
American wife into hiding under the guard of <LOCATION>Scotland</LOCATION> Yard
detectives.
   The <ORGANIZATION>British Foreign Office</ORGANIZATION> said on <DATE>Friday</DATE> that ``considerable
confusion persists'' within the Iranian government and that <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>
``intended to proceed with that fact in mind.'' It did not elaborate.
   Moslems condemned ``The Satanic Verses'' when it was published
late last year to critical acclaim in the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION>.
   Another round of protests began <DATE>Sunday</DATE> with demonstrations in
<LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>, where six people died. The protests spread and another
person was killed and 75 people injured in a series of
demonstrations in <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>.
   After <PERSON>Khomeini</PERSON> also ordered the death of publishers of the novel,
book companies in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Greece</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Turkey</LOCATION> decided
not to publish it. Others in <LOCATION>Finland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Norway</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> were unswayed.
   Major <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> booksellers such as <PERSON>B. Dalton</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Barnes &amp; Nobel</ORGANIZATION>
removed the novel from their shelves, and <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> halted imports. The
book has been officially banned in <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Bangladesh</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>.
   The governments of <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>United
States</LOCATION> condemned the Iranian compaign. The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> called it
``appalling.''
   The Times of <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> quoted ``a closely involved source'' as
saying <PERSON>Khomeini</PERSON>'s son Ahmad and three hard-line ministers may have
persuaded the 88-year-old spiritual leader to make the death call to
undermine a political rival seeking improved relations with <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>.
   The report said supporters of <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION>'s parliament speaker, <PERSON>Hashemi
Rafsanjani</PERSON>, believe <PERSON>Khomeini</PERSON>'s son and the government ministers
hoped the death call would deal a blow to British relations and
<PERSON>Rafsanjani</PERSON>.
   Some diplomats in the <LOCATION>Middle East</LOCATION> have speculated the <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>
issue was promoted by factions in <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> opposed to recent moves by
more pragmatic figures, including <PERSON>Rafsanjani</PERSON>, to improve relations
with the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION>.
   But <PERSON>Akhoond Zadeh Basti</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION>'s charge d'affaires in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, told
<ORGANIZATION>Independent Television News</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Britian</LOCATION> on <DATE>Friday</DATE> that <PERSON>Khomeini</PERSON>'s
call was ``based purely on religious grounds.''
   In <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>, <DATE>1988</DATE> Nobel Prize laureate <PERSON>Naguib Mahfouz</PERSON> <DATE>today</DATE> said
<PERSON>Khomeini</PERSON>'s call ``can undoubtedly be considered terrorism.'' The
76-year-old novelist said in an interview that the ``decision is
against humanity because it is against thought and against human
rights. It is also against Islam because it harms the reputation of
Islam and Moslems in the civilized world.''
   The head of the Shiite Moslem community in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> on <DATE>Friday</DATE> urged
book companies not to publish the novel, but he denounced <PERSON>Khomeini</PERSON>'s
death call.
   ``The Moslem world is shaken, shocked by this work, which throws
doubt on the authenticity of our holy book, which treats the wives
of the prophet as prostitutes,'' <PERSON>Ayatollah Mehdi Rhouani</PERSON> said from
his <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> home in an interview with <ORGANIZATION>The Associated Press</ORGANIZATION>. But he
said <PERSON>Khomeini</PERSON>'s decree was ``contrary to Islamic law, contrary to
international law, contrary to morals.''
   Rushdie's publishers showed the apology to <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Foreign
Office</ORGANIZATION> shortly before it was made public.
   A <ORGANIZATION>Foreign Office</ORGANIZATION> spokesman, who by custom was not identified,
said: ``The statement is, of course, a matter for <PERSON>Mr. Rushdie</PERSON> and
not for the government. But if it serves to calm passions, then that
can only be a good thing.''
   Members of <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s Moslem community welcomed <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>'s
statement. But leaders of the Islamic community in <LOCATION>Bradford</LOCATION>, where
some copies of the book were burned in public, said their campaign
against it would continue.
   ``I think the apology will calm down the situation but it will
not change the situation overall until the book is withdrawn from
circulation,'' said <PERSON>Liaqat Hussain</PERSON>, general secretary of the
<ORGANIZATION>Bradford Council of Mosques</ORGANIZATION>.
   Viking, the book's publishers in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>,
said earlier this week that it and the author ``very much regret the
distress the book has caused.'' But <PERSON>Viking</PERSON> did not apologize for
publishing the book.
   Before today's statement, <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> had said the novel was
fictional and not blasphemous.
   Moslems say ``The Satanic Verses'' blasphemes their religion by,
among other things, portraying the prophet <PERSON>Mohammed</PERSON>'s wives as
prostitutes and suggesting that he wrote the <LOCATION>Koran</LOCATION>, the holy book of
Islam, rather than receiving it from God.

<TEXT>
   <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> said <DATE>Thursday</DATE> it would not accept new
Iranian offers of negotiations until the Islamic government
renounces violence in the dispute over the novel ``The Satanic
Verses.''
   <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION>, however, said it was <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> that was making the overtures
and that author <PERSON>Salman Rushdie</PERSON> remains subject to ``divine justice.''
   Foreign Secretary Sir <PERSON>Geoffrey Howe</PERSON>, meanwhile, said he
understood the book was ``deeply offensive'' to Moslems, and that it
also offends Britons by likening their country to <LOCATION>Nazi Germany</LOCATION>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Foreign Office</ORGANIZATION> said it had been contacted <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> and
<DATE>Thursday</DATE> by the <ORGANIZATION>Iranian Foreign Ministry</ORGANIZATION> proposing a meeting in
<LOCATION>Geneva</LOCATION> this week.
   The Iranians, according to a <ORGANIZATION>Foreign Office</ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said they
wished to discuss a resolution passed <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> by the Majlis that
gave <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> a week to back away from its defense of Rushdie.
Otherwise, diplomatic relations would be severed.
   ``We saw no merit to a meeting at this stage,'' said the
spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``They would have to
renounce violence, or the threat of it. That is absolutely
cardinal.''
   That apparently means <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> would expect <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> to renounce the
death sentence pronounced against Rushdie by <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION>'s spiritual leader
<PERSON>Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini</PERSON> on <DATE>Feb. 14</DATE>. Iranian clergymen have
offered bounties up to <MONEY>$5.2 million</MONEY> for <ORGANIZATION>Rushdie</ORGANIZATION>'s death.
   Following the <ORGANIZATION>Foreign Office</ORGANIZATION> statements, the Iranian news agency
<ORGANIZATION>IRNA</ORGANIZATION> quoted a <ORGANIZATION>Foreign Ministry</ORGANIZATION> source as saying <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> proposed
talks and was rebuffed.
   <PERSON>Howe</PERSON> said in an interview on <ORGANIZATION>BBC</ORGANIZATION> radio that he could empathize
with Moslems feeling offended by book, which he said is ``offensive
in many other ways as well.
   ``We are not upholding the right of freedom to speak because we
like the book, because we agree with the book,'' he said.
   ``The British government, the British people, do not have any
affection for the book. The book is extremely critical, rude about
us. It compares <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> with <PERSON>Hitler</PERSON>'s <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>.
   ``So we are not sponsoring the book. What we are sponsoring is
the right of people to speak freely, to publish freely,'' he said.
   Rushdie is also critical in his book of Prime Minister <PERSON>Margaret
Thatcher</PERSON> and her conservative policies.
   Howe plans to meet in <LOCATION>Vienna</LOCATION> on <DATE>Monday</DATE> with Soviet Foreign
Minister <PERSON>Eduard Shevardnadze</PERSON>, who has indicated a willingness to
mediate.
   Since <PERSON>Khomeini</PERSON> condemned <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> and its 11 <ORGANIZATION>European
Economic Community</ORGANIZATION> partners have withdrawn their envoys from <LOCATION>Tehran</LOCATION>
and <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION>'s top diplomat left <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>.
   The Soviets' official <ORGANIZATION>Tass</ORGANIZATION> news agency, in a commentary
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, acknowledged the concern of Western countries about death
threats but defended <PERSON>Khomeini</PERSON>.
   ``Perhaps <PERSON>Imam Khomeini</PERSON>, the supreme religious authority in <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION>,
had no choice proceeding from <LOCATION>Koran</LOCATION> teachings, other than denouncing
a man who has insulted Islam?'' Tass diplomatic correspondent <PERSON>Vadim
Biryukov</PERSON> wrote.
   ``The denunciation was nothing more, by the way, than the
position of a religious leader,'' he wrote. ``The Iranian government
has not condemned Rushdie to death.''
   A similar line had been taken by <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION>'s charge d'affaires in
<LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Mohammad Basti</PERSON>, shortly before <PERSON>Khomeini</PERSON> quashed diplomatic
efforts by reaffirming the death sentence.
   At one point, Iranian President <PERSON>Ali Khamenei</PERSON> had said that
<PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> might save himself by apologizing, and Iranian diplomats
reacted positively to statements by their British counterparts that
<PERSON>Thatcher</PERSON>'s government had no role in publishing ``The Satanic
Verses.''
   The latest overtures from <LOCATION>Tehran</LOCATION> apparently reflect continuing
divisions within the Iranian government between Shiite Moslem
hard-liners and more moderate elements, who seek warmer ties with
the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION>.
   Rushdie, a native of <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> who is now a British citizen, is
reportedly in hiding in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> with his American wife. The <LOCATION>Zurich</LOCATION>
weekly Zuri-Woche, quoting sources identified only as ``literary
circles,'' said in its society column that <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> has fled to
<LOCATION>Switzerland</LOCATION>.
   In <LOCATION>Cairo</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>'s Nobel Prize-winning author <PERSON>Naguib Mahfouz</PERSON>, in a
newspaper interview published <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, urged Moslem countries to
condemn <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION>'s death sentence but proposed a boycott of Viking
Penguin, which published ``The Satanic Verses.''
   In <LOCATION>Stockholm</LOCATION> <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION>'s Nobel prize-awarding literary
academy defended free speech but did not explicitly support <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>.
The academy had been under pressure from literary and other
organizations to take a clear stand for <ORGANIZATION>Rushdie</ORGANIZATION>.
   Most of its members however have individually expressed strong
indignation at the campaign against <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>.
   Moslem demonstrators blocked roads and burned effigies of Rushdie
on <DATE>Thursday</DATE> in <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Bengal</LOCATION> state, and the <ORGANIZATION>United News of India</ORGANIZATION>
said 50 people were arrested.
   The book has been banned in <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Senegal</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Lebanon</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Saudi Arabia</LOCATION>,
<PERSON>Jordan</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Syria</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Bangladesh</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION>, and 18 people have died in protests in <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>.
   Moslems say ``The Satanic Verses'' is blasphemous because it
portrays the prophet <PERSON>Mohammed</PERSON>'s wives as prostitutes and suggests
that <PERSON>Mohammed</PERSON>, not God, was the source for the <LOCATION>Koran</LOCATION>, Islam's holy
book.
   At the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION>Security Council</ORGANIZATION> diplomat said the world
body would not stand up for <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> for fear of offending <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> and
jeopardizing forthcoming Iran-Iraq peace talks.

<TEXT>
   <PERSON>Salman Rushdie</PERSON> has been in hiding for 10 days under
a death sentence from <PERSON>Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini</PERSON>, but he has
fulfilled at least one literary commitment: a review of fellow
novelist <PERSON>Philip Roth</PERSON>'s autobiography.
   In the review for the weekly Observer newspaper, <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> is said
to hint at a feeling of kinship with the American Jewish author,
whose portrayals of his fellow Jews got him into trouble.
   ``In the course of reviewing <PERSON>Roth</PERSON>, who himself had a period when
he was vilified by the Jews, he (Rushdie) says he found <PERSON>Roth</PERSON> was not
just speaking to him but for him,'' <PERSON>Blake Morrison</PERSON>, the literary
editor who commissioned the article, told <ORGANIZATION>The Associated Press</ORGANIZATION>
<DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Roth</PERSON> was attacked in the <DATE>1960s</DATE> for his irreverent, painfully
personal descriptions of Jewish life, especially in his novel
``Portnoy's Complaint.''
   Rushdie, born a Moslem in <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>, has been deemed by <PERSON>Khomeini</PERSON> to
be a blasphemer for what he wrote in his novel, ``The Satanic
Verses'' about the prophet <PERSON>Mohammed</PERSON> and the <LOCATION>Koran</LOCATION>, the Moslem holy
book.
   The book <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> reviewed is ``The Facts,'' an autobiography in
which <PERSON>Roth</PERSON> responds to his Jewish critics.
   ``<PERSON>Mr. Rushdie</PERSON> says this has helped him during his own predicament
when he has been similarly beleaguered,'' <PERSON>Morrison</PERSON> said. ``By
quoting <PERSON>Roth</PERSON>, he gives some indication of his own feelings.''
   But where <PERSON>Roth</PERSON>'s fiction stirred debate primarily at the
intellectual level, <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>'s work has put his life in danger.
   Iran's spiritual leader issued the death call <DATE>Feb. 14</DATE>, and
Iranian clerics offered a <MONEY>$5.2 million</MONEY> bounty for the assassin. Most
experts on <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> have advised him to take the threat seriously, and
<PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> has said he does.
   Rushdie, 4l, reacted with shock and apparent bewilderment last
week when he was telephoned and told of the death sentence. He
dropped out of sight.
   Four days later he issued a terse statement apologizing for any
distress caused to Moslems by the publication of his book. He has
made no public statements since.
   Iran's president, <PERSON>Ali Khamenei</PERSON>, had indicated that an apology
could alleviate the sentence. But <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>'s words had no apparent
effect. On <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, <PERSON>Khamenei</PERSON> said: ``The arrow has been launched
toward its target. It is now flying toward its aim.''
   Asked to elaborate, a <PERSON>Khamenei</PERSON> aide said the arrow was directed
``toward the heart of this blasphemous bastard, <PERSON>Salman Rushdie</PERSON>. He
must be killed.''
   Rushdie and his American wife, novelist <PERSON>Marianne Wiggins</PERSON>, are at
an undisclosed address, and both have canceled <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> promotional
tours _ Rushdie to publicize ``The Satanic Verses'' and <PERSON>Ms. Wiggins</PERSON>
to publicize her latest novel, the critically acclaimed ``John
Dollar.''
   <PERSON>Morrison</PERSON> said the review in The Observer would appear <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, a
week later than originally planned.
   He said <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> telephoned him on the day he went into hiding and
assured him he would write the review. He phoned again this week to
make sure it had arrived in the mail.
   <PERSON>Morrison</PERSON> said <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> asked that their conversation about his
ordeal not be publicized, and <PERSON>Morrison</PERSON> declined to say anything that
might hint at the novelist's whereabouts.
   Many Moslems say ``The Satanic Verses'' is sacrilegious because
it casts doubt on central tenets of the Islamic faith. The book, for
example, portrays the prophet <PERSON>Mohammed</PERSON>'s wives as prostitutes and
suggests he wrote the <LOCATION>Koran</LOCATION>, the holy book of Islam, rather than
receiving it from God.
   In other developments <DATE>Thursday</DATE>:
   _ Former pop singer Cat <PERSON>Stevens</PERSON>, who gave up a successful music
career in <DATE>1977</DATE> after becoming a Moslem, endorsed <PERSON>Khomeini</PERSON>'s order.
<PERSON>Stevens</PERSON>, who has changed his name to <PERSON>Yussuf Islam</PERSON> and is a teacher
in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, told Moslem students: ``The Koran makes it clear _ if
someone defames the prophet, then he must die.''
   _ Police in <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> said they received a bomb threat against the

<HEAD>After a Year Under Death Threat, Salman Rushdie Fights Back</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LESLIE SHEPHERD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One year after he was driven into hiding by an
Islamic death sentence, <PERSON>Salman Rushdie</PERSON> has begun to fight back.
   With a long interview and an essay in a <DATE>Sunday</DATE> newspaper, plus a
lecture written from hiding, the 42-year-old author is mounting a
vigorous, unapologetic defense of ``The Satanic Verses'' and shows
no inclination to bow to pressure to back down.
   That pressure is manifesting itself in a heated debate about
whether ``The Satanic Verses'' should be published in paperback.
Yes, says <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>. No, say those who fear it will lead to Moslem
unrest.
   The opponents include lawmakers, writers and relatives of
British hostages in <LOCATION>Lebanon</LOCATION>. Free speech has its limits, they say,
and a paperback edition would only worsen a conflict that has
already damaged Anglo-Moslem relations and led to deadly rioting.
   Some of <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>'s supporters worry that the furor that greeted
the death sentence imposed by <PERSON>Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION>
last <DATE>Feb. 14</DATE> is dissipating.
   ``There has been this gradual shift ... into considering <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>
as a criminal, from someone to be supported, here's someone who
caused disquiet, unrest,'' said <PERSON>Frances D'Souza</PERSON>, head of the
<ORGANIZATION>International Committee</ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION>Defense of Salman Rushdie</ORGANIZATION> and his
Publishers.
   The issue has domestic political implications too. The
opposition <ORGANIZATION>Labor Party</ORGANIZATION>, which <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> always supported, is torn
between the principle of free speech and the fear of losing Moslem
votes.
   Rushdie acknowledges his book has caused pain but appeals to
moderate Moslems to reconsider their campaign. The Bombay-born
Briton says he renounced Islam in his youth, and therefore cannot
be accused of blasphemy or reneging on his faith.
   If the uproar represents the conflict between Islamic
fundamentalism and Western libertarianism, <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> is firmly on the
side of the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION>.
   His lecture at the <ORGANIZATION>Institute of Contemporary Art</ORGANIZATION>, delivered by
playwright <PERSON>Harold Pinter</PERSON> and attended by a host of literary
heavyweights, cited an array of writers through the ages to defend
free speech and decry religious absolutism.
   ``The True Believer knows that he is simply right, and you are
wrong. He will seek to convert you, even by force (or)... despise
you for your unbelief,'' he wrote.
   Within days of the publication of ``The Satanic Verses'' in
<DATE>September 1988</DATE>, Moslems were claiming it insulted the Prophet
Mohammed by associating him with prostitutes, and the <LOCATION>Koran</LOCATION>, their
holy book, by suggesting it was man's work, not <ORGANIZATION>Allah's</ORGANIZATION>.
   The worldwide protests and book-burnings, and the deadly riots
in <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>, culminated in <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> promising a
multimillion-dollar reward for anyone who killed <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>. Khomeini
died in <DATE>June</DATE>, but the edict stands.
   Rushdie was at his north <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> home <DATE>last Valentine's Day</DATE>, when
the <ORGANIZATION>British Broadcasting Corp.</ORGANIZATION> told him of <PERSON>Khomeini</PERSON>'s edict. The
same day, <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> dropped out of sight with his wife, American
novelist <PERSON>Marianne Wiggins</PERSON>.
   Since then he has been under round-the-clock armed guard at a
series of houses operated by <ORGANIZATION>Special Branch</ORGANIZATION> security police and
MI5, the domestic intelligence agency.
   <PERSON>Ms. Wiggins</PERSON> moved out in <DATE>August</DATE>. She denies there were marital
difficulties. Rushdie confined himself to publishing occasional
book reviews but stayed out of the debate on his book, saying he
felt his silence would be more eloquent.
   ``The Satanic Verses'' has sold more than 1 million copies in
English, almost three-quarters of those in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, and
has been on the <DATE>Sunday</DATE> Times of <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> bestseller list for 49 weeks.
   It has been translated into 15 other languages and been banned
in more than 20 countries.
   Writers and commentators initially rallied to <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>'s defense,
with 2,500 worldwide signing a petition.
   But in recent weeks, spy writer <ORGANIZATION>John le Carre</ORGANIZATION> and liberal
political columnist <PERSON>Hugo Young</PERSON> have openly pressed <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> to
abandon the paperback edition.
   Rushdie maintains the paperback is essential if his book is to
last for posterity.
   Without a paperback, ``in a few years the book simply won't be
there for anyone who wants to read it,'' he told The Independent on
<DATE>Sunday</DATE>. ``It will, in all practical terms, have been suppressed.''
   But writing in the left-leaning Guardian newspaper, le <PERSON>Carre</PERSON>
said, ``Nobody has a God-given right to insult a great religion and
be published with impunity.''
   Young, a Guardian columnist, urged <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> to renounce the
paperback ``on the deeply considered grounds that it could do more
harm than good.''
   Relatives of British hostages issued a statement saying
paperback publication would be ``misconceived and irresponsible''
and could make conditions worse for the captives, believed held by
Moslem extremists.
   Viking Penguin says ``no firm date'' has been set for paperback
publication. The publishers have reason to be evasive. Khomeini's
death sentence extended to them too, and they have received 35,000
abusive or threatening letters and 45 bomb threats in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> and
the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, says spokesman <PERSON>Bob Gregory</PERSON>.
   The company's British headquarters have been evacuated six
times, and five incendiary devices have been found in its stores,
two of which exploded. Worldwide security measures cost <MONEY>$3.4
million</MONEY> a year, <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> said.
   In a 7,000-word essay for The Independent on <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>
touched on his lonely existence and the shock of being condemned by
Moslems for what he thought was a sympathetic account of their
plight as immigrants in the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION>.
   ``Do I feel regret? Of course I do: regret that such offense has
been taken against my work when it was not intended ...,'' <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>
wrote.
   ``Would I have written it differently If I had known what would
happen? Truthfully, I don't know. Would I change any of the text
now? I would not. It's too late.''

<TEXT>
   More than 50,000 Moslems left mosques
and marched throughout the capital <DATE>Friday</DATE> before gathering at the
government's headquarters to demand the death of author <PERSON>Salman
Rushdie</PERSON>.
   Also <DATE>Friday</DATE> about 3,000 Moslem fundamentalists in <LOCATION>Sudan</LOCATION>, some
shouting ``Down, down with <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>!'' demanded that <LOCATION>Sudan</LOCATION> break
relations with the British government which has defended publication
of <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>'s book ``The Satanic Verses.''
   In <LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION>, the government banned the <DATE>March 13</DATE> issue of Newsweek
magazine and the <DATE>March 9</DATE> issues of the <ORGANIZATION>Hong Kong-based Far Eastern
Economic Review</ORGANIZATION> for printing extracts from the book.
   Many Moslems find the book blasphemous because it suggests the
prophet <PERSON>Mohammed</PERSON> wrote the Koran instead of receiving it from God
and because its characters include prostitutes who take the names of
<ORGANIZATION>Mohammed</ORGANIZATION>'s wives.
   Several countries including <LOCATION>Bangladesh</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION> have banned
the book, and <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> has offered <MONEY>$5.2 million</MONEY> to any Moslem who kills
<PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>, an Indian-born Briton of Moslem upbringing.
   Marchers in <LOCATION>Dhaka</LOCATION> chanted ``We will kill Rushdie'' and gathered
near the Secretariat, the headquarters of the government. Several
hundred policemen in riot gear followed the marchers but there was
no violence.
   More than 15,000 followers of Jamaat-e-Islami, a fundamentalist
Moslem party, held another rally in front of the city's main mosque
and religious leaders accused Zionists of ``conspiring against Islam
and its prophet Mohammed.''
   Seven of the country's top religious leaders have called for a
nationwide general strike on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> to protest the book.
   A youth organization has set up a 15-member death squad to kill
<PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> if he comes to <LOCATION>Bangladesh</LOCATION>. The group is led by <PERSON>Farooq Ahmed</PERSON>,
who said the squad had no plans to go to <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> to kill <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>, who
is in hiding somewhere in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>.
   The demonstrators in the Sudanese capital, <LOCATION>Khartoum</LOCATION>, urged the
government to break relations with <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> and boycott all its goods.
   The protest, led by the fundamenalist <ORGANIZATION>National Islamic Front</ORGANIZATION>, is
seen as the party's first sign of opposition to Prime Minister <PERSON>Sadek
Mahdi</PERSON>.
   Mahdi is in the process of forming a new broad-based government
that would start talks with <LOCATION>Sudan</LOCATION>'s southern rebels to end the
6-year-old civil war.
   The <ORGANIZATION>National Islamic Front</ORGANIZATION> has said it will not join the new
government because negotiations and a peace treaty with the rebel
<ORGANIZATION>Sudan People's Liberation Army</ORGANIZATION> would mean a suspension of the
<ORGANIZATION>Islamic Sharia</ORGANIZATION> law.
   <LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION>'s deputy home affairs minister, <PERSON>Megat Junid Megat Ayub</PERSON>,
told reporters the <ORGANIZATION>Newsweek</ORGANIZATION> and Far Eastern Economic Review issues
were banned because the contents would have a deterimental effect on
Moslems, whose faith is the official religion.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Malaysian Home Affairs Ministry</ORGANIZATION> must receive a copy of all
incoming foreign publications including newspapers. Sometimes
articles or parts of articles are blackened out and occasionally the
entire issue is banned.

<HEAD>Author of Banned Book Sends Critical Letter To Gandhi</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A novelist whose latest book was banned
in <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> accused the government of bowing to religious
fundamentalists and denounced the ban in an angry letter to Prime
Minister <PERSON>Rajiv Gandhi</PERSON>.
   Indian newspapers on <DATE>Thursday</DATE> published <PERSON>Salman Rushdie</PERSON>'s letter,
which urged a lifting of the ban on ``The Satanic Verses.''
   Rushdie, 41, is a British citizen of Indian descent and lives in
<LOCATION>London</LOCATION>. He won the <ORGANIZATION>Booker Prize</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s most prestigious
literary award, for his first book, ``Midnight's Children,'' a
broad satire on post-independence <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>.
   ``Satanic Verses'' has also been nominated for the <ORGANIZATION>Booker Prize</ORGANIZATION>,
which is announced <DATE>Oct. 25</DATE>. Rushdie's second novel, ``Shame,''
earned wide acclaim.
   ``Satanic Verses'' was banned <DATE>Oct. 5</DATE> after complaints from
Moslem members of <ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION>. They said they feared Moslem
militants might use the book to incite communal riots.
   The book is sharply critical of religious fundamentalism and
makes veiled references of the prophet <PERSON>Mohammed</PERSON> and the <LOCATION>Koran</LOCATION>, the
sacred book of Moslems.
   The complicated story, which mixes elements of realism and
fantasy, focuses on two Indian characters. The benevolent one acts
as a messenger for Mohammed, the founder of the Islamic religion.
The other is satanic and manipulative.
   In the letter carried on the front pages of major Indian daily
newspapers, <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> accused <PERSON>Gandhi</PERSON> of denying the right to free
expression at the behest of religious fundamentalists.
   ``The right to freedom of expression is at the very foundation
of any democratic society, and at present, all over the world,
Indian democracy is becoming something of a laughingstock,''
<PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> wrote.
   ``When ... self-appointed guardians of Muslim sensibilities say
that no civilized society should permit the publication of a book
like mine, they have got things backwards. The question raised by
the book's banning is precisely whether <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>, by behaving in this
somewhat South African fashion, can any more lay claim to the title
of civilized society,'' the author said.
   The prime minister was touring northern <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> on <DATE>Thursday</DATE> and
his office had no comment on <ORGANIZATION>Rushdie</ORGANIZATION>'s letter.
   The ban has been widely criticized in <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and abroad. Indian
newspapers have been particularly outspoken.
   The conservative daily, The Hindu, criticized the ban as a
``Philistine decision'' while the anti-government <ORGANIZATION>Indian Express</ORGANIZATION>
called it ``thought control.''
   Under the ban, the <ORGANIZATION>Ministry of Finance</ORGANIZATION> barred importation of the
book or sale of it. There was no hearing before the decision was
made.
   In an interview published <DATE>Thursday</DATE> in <ORGANIZATION>The New York Times</ORGANIZATION>,
<PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> said, ``The idea that the Minister of <ORGANIZATION>Finance</ORGANIZATION> should decide
what books should be read and not be read is not acceptable in a
free country.''
   ``It seems to me that the government has grown very week in
<LOCATION>India</LOCATION> while the power of religious extremists seems to have grown
very strong,'' he was quoted as saying. ``The book is not the
issue. This is an attempt to manipulate the government.''
   ``The Satanic Verses'' was published <DATE>Sept. 22</DATE> in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> and is
scheduled to be published in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> in <DATE>February</DATE>.
   Six people, including playwright <PERSON>Tom Stoppard</PERSON> and novelist
<PERSON>Kingsley Amis</PERSON>, signed a telegram to Gandhi protesting the ban.
   The protest telegram, which was sent last week, said: ``We
consider that the banning of a serious work of literature
represents a very grave threat to freedom of expression in your
country, and strongly urge you to ensure that the ban is lifted.''
   The other signers were poet <PERSON>Stephen Spender</PERSON>; <PERSON>Philip Spender</PERSON> and
<PERSON>Sally Laird</PERSON>, the director and editor, respectively, of Index on
Censorship, a British-based journal on free speech issues; and
<PERSON>Kevin Boyle</PERSON>, director of Article 19, a second anti-censorship
organization.

<HEAD>Khomeini's Rushdie Condemnation Unrelated to `Verses,' Editors Told</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A leading writer on Islamic militancy said
<DATE>Thursday</DATE> that the <PERSON>Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini</PERSON>'s order to
assassinate <PERSON>Salman Rushdie</PERSON>, author of the novel ``Satanic Verses,''
had nothing to do with revulsion over the contents of the book.
   <PERSON>Robin Wright</PERSON>, herself once the target of a Mideast death threat,
said that <PERSON>Khomeini</PERSON>, seizing upon the growing fury among <PERSON>Sunni</PERSON> and
Shiite Moslems over the book, issued the edict against <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> in a
bid to gain the leadership of the entire Islamic world.
   <PERSON>Ms. Wright</PERSON>, author ``Sacred Rage: the Wrath of Militant Islam,''
and the upcoming ``In the Name of God: <PERSON>Khomeini</PERSON>'s Revolutionary
Decade,'' said <PERSON>Khomeini</PERSON> also was using the issue to divert
attention from domestic problems, just as he created the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
hostage crisis in <DATE>1979</DATE> to mobilize public support for his troubled
regime.
   But ``I suspect that <PERSON>Khomeini</PERSON> is in a minority'' among Iranian
clerics and political leaders on the issue of Rushdie, she said,
noting the assassination order ``has erased most of the diplomatic
gains made by <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> since the end of the war with <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION>.'' She
predicted history will view the episode as ``a tragic spasm.''
   <PERSON>Ms. Wright</PERSON>, a national security reporter for <ORGANIZATION>The Los Angeles
Times</ORGANIZATION>, was among participants in a seminar on the Rushdie affair at
the annual convention of the <ORGANIZATION>American Society of Newspaper Editors</ORGANIZATION>.
Others included author <PERSON>Larry McMurtry</PERSON>; <PERSON>Ed Murrow</PERSON>, president of the
<ORGANIZATION>American Booksellers Association</ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON>Andy Ross</PERSON>, whose <LOCATION>Berkeley</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, bookstore, Cody's, was bombed in <DATE>February</DATE> after it began
selling ``Satanic Verses.''
   Ross described in wrenching terms the anguish he and his 55
employees went through in arriving at their joint decision to
resume sales of the book after a Molotov cocktail damaged the
store, but caused no injuries, in the early hours of <DATE>Feb. 28</DATE>.
``It's quite possible my store has the dubious honor of being the
first victim of international terrorism in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>,'' he
said.
   <PERSON>Ross</PERSON> said ``the bombing accomplished its goal, which was to
create an atmosphere of terror, and to let the world know that
under the new order of things, the sale of prescribed ideas could
be conducted only at great personal risk.''
   ``I can tell you that the decision to carry the `Verses' (after
the bombing) was perhaps the most difficult decision of my life,''
he said. ``If people were murdered, who is to say if such an act
(selling the book) was courageous or foolhardy?''
   <PERSON>Ross</PERSON> expressed some bitterness over criticism within the
literary community of bookstores that withdrew the book from their
shelves. ``I personally thought it was unbecoming for <PERSON>Norman Mailer</PERSON>
and others to expound from the safety of their coop apartments what
was correct moral behavior for bookstores in the front lines,
stores on the street vulnerable to terrorist activity 24 hours a
day,'' he said.
   He also said that the ``role of the media was a source of
paradox. The level of coverage was an element that only inflamed
the fanatics. The more you exericized your freedom of expression in
reporting the story, the greater the likelihood that my freedom of
expression would be abridged by terror.''
   <PERSON>Ms. Wright</PERSON>, once threatened with death for reporting an
attempted coup against Syrian leader <PERSON>Hafez Assad</PERSON>, said she did not
doubt that <PERSON>Khomeini</PERSON> was ``genuinely outraged by the comic and
almost pornographic approach to Islam taken in `Satanic Verses.'''
   But she noted the assassination order, coupled with a <MONEY>$5.2
million</MONEY> bounty offer, was not issued until mid-February, five
months after publication.
   Rushdie, born in <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> of Moslem parents, and his American wife,
author <PERSON>Mary Wiggins</PERSON>, went into hiding, presumably in <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>,
shortly after <PERSON>Khomeini</PERSON>'s order.
   The book includes a brothel scene in which prostitutes take the
names of the prophet <PERSON>Mohammed</PERSON>'s wives, and it suggest Mohammed
wrote the holy Koran instead of receiving it from <LOCATION>Allah</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Ms. Wright</PERSON> noted that Islam ``is not the only religion to
condemn those who engage in blasphemy.'' She cited a passage from
the book of <LOCATION>Leviticus</LOCATION> in the Old Testament: ``He that blasphemes
the name of the Lord ... shall surely be put to death, and all the
congregation shall certainly stone him.''
   McMurtry, author of ``Lonesome Dove'' and other best-sellers,
said that ``tyrants, whether secular or religious, have exhibited
far more respect for language than have democratic governments.
Tyrants demonstrate that respect by sending their most able and
threatening servants, the best writers, to the stake, the block or
the gulag.''
   He complained that the response of Western governments to
<PERSON>Khomeini</PERSON>'s order, ``insofar as they've responded at all, has been a
light noise, sounds without significance or without force. In time,
virtually all communications will be weakened without unfettered
freedom to express ourselves as we need to.''
   But <PERSON>Ross</PERSON> said ``I was not exceedingly disturbed by the almost
insultingly bland statements by public officials, including
President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>, because they at least had the value of not inciting
additional violence.''

   An Iranian envoy has been dispatched to
encourage other Moslem nations to support <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION>'s position on the
novel ``The Satanic Verses'' at a conference this week, according to
news reports <DATE>Saturday</DATE>.
   In <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>, home of the novel's author, <PERSON>Salman Rushdie</PERSON>, Moslems
staged demonstrations in two cities.
   Iran's official <ORGANIZATION>Islamic Republic News Agency</ORGANIZATION> reported that
<ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION> speaker <PERSON>Hashemi Rafsanjani</PERSON> said during an audience with
<PERSON>Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini</PERSON> the controversy over the book was
helping export the Islamic revolution.
   <PERSON>Khomeini</PERSON> did not speak during the meeting at a mosque in a <LOCATION>Tehran</LOCATION>
suburb, said <ORGANIZATION>IRNA</ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION>Nicosia</LOCATION>.
   IRNA said <PERSON>Ayatollah Ahmed Jannati</PERSON>, a special envoy, was touring
Moslem states in the region to try to forge a united front on the
issue at the <ORGANIZATION>Organization of Islamic Conference</ORGANIZATION> meeting scheduled to
begin <DATE>Monday</DATE> in <LOCATION>Saudi Arabia</LOCATION>.
   Pakistani Foreign Minister <PERSON>Sahabzada Yaqub Khan</PERSON> said in a meeting
with his Iranian counterpart, <PERSON>Ali Akbar Velayati</PERSON>, that he hoped the
<ORGANIZATION>OIC</ORGANIZATION> ``will take a decisive stand to condemn the book,'' <ORGANIZATION>IRNA</ORGANIZATION>
reported.
   Observers expect a showdown between the majority <PERSON>Sunni</PERSON> and the
minority Shiite Moslems over the issue.
   There are 100 million Shiites among the world's estimated 1
billion Moslems. More than half the Shiites live in <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION>, which has
called on Moslems to kill <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>.
   Many Moslems say ``The Satanic Verses'' blasphemes Islam by
portraying the prophet <PERSON>Mohammed</PERSON>'s wives as prostitutes and
suggesting Mohammed wrote the Koran rather than receiving it from
God.
   Most nations in the <LOCATION>Middle East</LOCATION> have banned the book, as have
Asian countries with large Moslem populations.
   At least 19 people have been killed in <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> in
riots over the novel.
   Rushdie, a naturalized British citizen born to a Moslem family in
<LOCATION>India</LOCATION>, went into hiding after <PERSON>Khomeini</PERSON> issued his death threat last
month and Iranian religious leaders put a <MONEY>$5.2 million</MONEY> bounty on his
head.
   Iran broke diplomatic relations with <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> on <DATE>March 7</DATE> over its
refusal to suppress the novel.
   On <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, 2,000 Moslems marched five miles through the town of
Slough west of <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> and burned an effigy of Rushdie.
   Dozens of police officers escorted the marchers and lines of
officers stood guard outside bookshops. Police said the march was
peaceful and there were no arrests.
   Busloads of protesters from around the English Midlands converged
on the central <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> town of <LOCATION>Leicester</LOCATION>, and about 5,000 marched
three miles through the city center.
   Police stopped the protesters from burning an effigy of Rushdie.
No one was arrested.
