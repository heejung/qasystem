   You don't have to go into the woods to enjoy
viewing wildlife. You can attract a wide variety of wildlife to your
yard with a little planning and planting.
   All animals need food, water and shelter. Trees are a good place
to start. Pick varieties that produce fruits, berries or nuts and
plant different varieties that produce those foods at different
times of the year.
   The <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Forest Service</ORGANIZATION> suggests the following varieties by
region:
   South _ live oak, black gum, American holly and flowering dogwood.
   Southwest _ pinyon pine, live oak, box elder and mesquite.
   West Coast _ dogwood, hawthorne, serviceberry, black oak, <PERSON>Douglas</PERSON>
fir and Ponderosa pine.
   Your local nursery, the <ORGANIZATION>Forest Service</ORGANIZATION> or your county
agricultural extension agent all can help select varieties for your
yard.
   Birds are either fruit and seed eaters or meat-eaters.
   Orioles, vireos, warblers, chickadees, nuthatches and woodpeckers
like mature trees with large insect populations. The robin needs a
lawn with plenty of worms.
   To encourage robins and other ground feeders, water your lawn
regularly. Many species of birds love to bathe in the spray and a
well-watered lawn helps provide a good supply of both worms and
insects. It also provides mud for robins and eaves swallows to build
nests.
   If possible, let one corner of the yard grow wild with weeds and
bushes. You also can pile brush or old Christmas trees in a back
corner to create cover for both birds and small mammals, including
rabbits and ground squirrels.
   If you have alders, birches, pines, oaks, dogwoods or other
seed-producing trees, you can bet you will have squirrels.
   Seed-eating birds and flower-seeking birds often need help to
survive in the city.
   Princessfeather, asters, rockpurslanes, blessed thistle,
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION> poppies, cosmos, marigold, sunflowers, tarweed,
forget-me-not, portucala, silene, zinnas and varieties of sorghum
grow large quantiites of seeds and won't become yard pests.
   Fruit-bearing trees and shrubs are popular with birds and
squirrels.
   More than 100 species of birds will throng to raspberry,
blackberry and elderberry bushes. Other popular species are juniper,
red cedar, bayberry, mulberry, pokeberry, strawberry, sumack,
grapevines and blueberry. They will bring woodpeckers, waxwings,
cardinals, bluebirds, orioles, warblers, robins, flickers and
finches.
   Hummingbirds are the best-known flower seekers.
   They are very fond of cultivated flowers, particularly those with
red, orange or purple petals. Varieties include daylilies, lilies,
canas, morning-glories, petunias, honeysuckles, jewelweed and
trumpetcreeper.
   In <DATE>summer</DATE>, the best way to bring birds and other animals is to
provide water. In dry weather, it can mean life or death.
   A bird bath a few inches deep with the bottom sloping gradually
upward toward the edge is one of the best bets. Make sure the bottom
and the edge are rough to provide good footing. Change the water
regularly.
   Make sure it is elevated because a bird bath on the ground can be
a happy hunting ground for the local feline population.
   In <DATE>winter</DATE>, food is a magnet.
   A feeder can be as simple as a Christmas tree, decorated with
popcorn or cranberries. It's best to offer several birdfeeders with
different delicacies in each.
   Place the feeders near trees or shrubs, particularly evergreens.
Many species will stay hungry rather than fly from cover to a bare
post in the middle of the yard.
   Different species prefer different foods. Cardinals and blue jays
like sunflower seeds. Goldfinches like thistles. Sparrows and
juncoes like cracked corn. All the insect eaters, such as
woodpeckers, nuthatches and chickadees, love suet, the waste fat
from beef.
   Avoid bagged, mixed bird seed. Many brands, particularly cheaper
ones, contain varieties songbirds don't eat. Often it is cheaper to
buy one large bag each of several varieties of seed and put each
seed in a different feeder.
   Keep an area under an eave or overhanging tree branch clear of
show and scatter seed for groundfeeders.

BOTH THE TIMBER INDUSTRY AND PROTECTORS OF A RARE WOODPECKER ARE COMPETING FOR 
THE SAME TREES.

<P>
Deep in the <LOCATION>northern Florida</LOCATION> woods, miles from anywhere, <PERSON>Jane Monaghan</PERSON> stands 
stock-still among the palmetto scrub, listening. "<LOCATION>Nuthatches</LOCATION>, red-bellies, 
chickadees, pine warblers, cardinals," she says, ticking off the calls she's 
not interested in. 
</P>
<P>
Then, on the breeze whispering through the pine trees, comes the familiar 
squeaky chatter she has been waiting for, and <PERSON>Monaghan</PERSON> turns just in time to 
see a pair of dark-winged birds rocket into a silver-dollar-size hole in a 
nearby tree. 
</P>
<P>
"There they are," says <PERSON>Monaghan</PERSON>, 28, a biologist with the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Forest Service</ORGANIZATION>. 
"The RCW, the spotted owl of the Southeast. You know, it's always kind of a 
thrill to see them." 
</P>
<P>
RCW is naturalist shorthand for red-cockaded woodpecker, the rarest of American 
woodpeckers, and the bird that has recently become the bane of the timber 
industry in the Southeast, particularly in <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>. Both the woodpeckers and 
the loggers covet the same trees -- mature, long-leaf pine trees at least 60 
years old and 70 feet tall. The timber companies want the trees for high-grade 
board lumber and telephone poles. The birds want them for homes. 
</P>
<P>
Lately, in the 180,000-acre <ORGANIZATION>Osceola National Forest</ORGANIZATION>, anyway, the birds have 
been winning. Long protected as an endangered species, the woodpeckers have 
recently benefited from new federal guidelines that increase the buffer zone 
around their colonies and severely reduce the acreage open to logging. 
</P>
<P>
The issue -- for both the birds and the loggers -- is survival. "I think it's 
safe to say that if we are going to survive, we'd have to rebuild the mill to 
do something different than we do now," says <PERSON>Ron Lane</PERSON>, a timber buyer for 
<ORGANIZATION>Daniels Lumber Co.</ORGANIZATION>, which employs 60 people in <LOCATION>Lake City</LOCATION> at the western edge of 
the <LOCATION>Osceola</LOCATION>. "People say they want more protection for these animals, but when 
they find out the real cost it may be too late." 
</P>
<P>
Monaghan worries that it already may be too late for the woodpeckers. Over the 
past two years she has identified 44 red-cockaded woodpecker clans, each 
containing one breeding pair and up to seven other family members, in the 
<LOCATION>Osceola</LOCATION>. But her federal mandate is to increase the number of clans to 250, and 
the only way to do that is preserve the old-growth trees in which the birds 
bore their nesting cavities. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, the struggle to save endangered plants and 
animals while balancing the economic costs becomes more acute each day. In the 
<LOCATION>Pacific Northwest</LOCATION>, it's the spotted owl versus the loggers. In <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>, a red 
squirrel is threatened by a complex of observatories. In <LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION>, a dam project 
could harm whooping cranes. Just west of <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>, urban sprawl up to the edge of 
the <LOCATION>Everglades</LOCATION> makes life perilous for a host of rare creatures. 
</P>
<P>
The conflict here over a small, seldom-seen woodpecker is no less critical or 
emotional. In <DATE>1987</DATE>, two Ocala-area home builders were charged with cutting down 
200 nesting trees and then shotgunning two of the birds in order to avoid legal 
obligations to set aside land for the birds near a planned housing development. 
After guilty pleas, the two were fined <MONEY>$300,000</MONEY>. Some <MONEY>$50,000</MONEY> of that money is 
being used to fund <PERSON>Monaghan</PERSON>'s recovery effort. 
</P>
<P>
The woodpecker is not well-known, says <PERSON>Monaghan</PERSON>, "and it's not a cute fuzzy 
like the manatee. But if we lose him, it means we're losing the habitat too. It 
means there would be a niche not filled, and who knows what other species may 
be dependent on it? I don't think the timber interests understand." 
</P>
<P>
What the timber interests understand best are their numbers. Last year, sales 
from <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>'s three national forests put <MONEY>$8.5 million</MONEY> in federal coffers, a 
fourth of which is shared by local counties for schools and roads. 
</P>
<P>
In the <LOCATION>Osceola</LOCATION>, the smallest of the state's three national forests, private 
loggers in <DATE>1989</DATE> cut 17 million board feet of lumber. This year, because of 
restrictions designed to protect the woodpeckers, that figure will dip to 11 
million. By <DATE>1992</DATE>, the estimated total will be no more than 5 million board 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>Forest Service Timber Purchasers Council</ORGANIZATION>, an Atlanta-based group of 120 
private logging companies, has filed suit, charging that the government 
illegally drew the more restrictive guidelines that enlarged the buffer zone 
from 200 feet to three-quarters of a mile, a loss to loggers of 900 acres 
around each colony. 
</P>
<P>
Monaghan does not argue that all logging in national forests should be stopped. 
In fact, for the woodpeckers, removal of some trees is even desirable because 
the birds prefer to nest in tall pines with a clear understory. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Hurricane Hugo ripped through the <ORGANIZATION>Francis Marion National Forest</ORGANIZATION> 
north of <LOCATION>Charleston</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>S.C.</LOCATION>, and virtually wiped out what had been the largest 
population of the woodpeckers. That loss, says <PERSON>Monaghan</PERSON>, makes efforts here 
even more critical. "We should be able to stabilize this population in the next 
five years and keep it from declining," she says. "We can't assure its 
survival. But at least we know what to do to help."

<P>
Huddled on the snowy bank of the Snake River at <LOCATION>Moose</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Dornan</PERSON>'s may be the 
world's most scenic bar. Before its picture window, skiers gather to sip Irish 
coffee at sunset and pay homage to the stunning mountain panorama. Peaks and 
jagged pinnacles tower over this valley like a Gothic cathedral. The Grand 
Tetons, a choir of majestic granite spires, trumpet their beauty through the 
high country basin called <ORGANIZATION>Jackson Hole</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
While <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON> Hole offers an unspoiled paradise for winter recreation, the 
region resounds with a sanctity and power that enrich the spirit. Dramatic 
vistas and wildlife abound. The valley is part of the largest chunk of 
wilderness left in the world's temperate zones. 
</P>
<P>
Named for <PERSON>Davey Jackson</PERSON>, a beaver trapper who claimed this "hole," or valley, 
his territory in the <DATE>1800s</DATE>, <LOCATION>Jackson Hole</LOCATION> is hemmed in by mountains. The flat, 
mile-high valley reaches south from <LOCATION>Yellowstone National Park</LOCATION> for 50 miles, 
holding some of the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION>'s most spectacular country, terminating here in the 
town of <LOCATION>Jackson</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Snow is powdery from Thanksgiving to <LOCATION>Easter</LOCATION>, and terrain to ski and explore 
remains virtually unlimited. Wide trails follow the course of the <LOCATION>Snake River</LOCATION>, 
a fertile habitat for wildlife. Flocks of ducks and teams of trumpeter swans 
honk their greetings as the fish-filled river winds its way along the valley

<P>
floor from headwaters deep in <LOCATION>Yellowstone</LOCATION>. In this primitive environment you're 
more likely to meet a moose than another skier. 
</P>
<P>
Ski beneath the Tetons and experience nature's symphony. Wind whistles in steep 
glacier-carved canyons where streams chime with melting snow. A chain of lakes 
shimmer; chickadees carol in meadows at the foot of misty gabled peaks. The 
refulgent landscape is a balm and benediction. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to some farsighted folks, the region remains a living paradigm of 
primordial <LOCATION>Western America</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>John D. Rockefeller</PERSON> donated much of the land now included in <LOCATION>Grand Teton 
National Park</LOCATION>. Local writer <PERSON>Margaret Murie</PERSON>, 87, energetically carries on the 
conservation cause. 
</P>
<P>
Only <PERCENT>3%</PERCENT> of <LOCATION>Teton County</LOCATION> is privately owned, and the rest is protected within 
the national park, <ORGANIZATION>Bridger-Teton National Forest</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>National Elk Refuge</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Preservation efforts do not keep out modern recreation. The pleasures of high 
mountain helicopter and downhill skiing, snowmobiling, ice skating, snowshoe 
hiking and dude ranching are plentiful. You can take a moonlit sleigh ride, go 
by dog sled to dinner or drive a snowmobile to Granite Hot Springs for a soak 
in nature's own Jacuzzi. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wide-Open Spaces 
</P>
<P>
Downhill skiers have a profusion of wide-open spaces. Three major ski areas 
include more than 5,000 acres of slopes and trails and an aerial tram. Snow 
<ORGANIZATION>King Mountain</ORGANIZATION>, imposing backdrop for the colorful town of <LOCATION>Jackson</LOCATION>, is <LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION>'s 
oldest ski area. 
</P>
<P>
At family-oriented <ORGANIZATION>Grand Targhee Resort</ORGANIZATION> on the west side of the Tetons, snow is 
so light and deep that few slopes even need grooming. Targhee averages more 
than 500 inches of annual snowfall and claims the best powder skiing in the 
northern Rockies. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson Hole Ski Resort at <ORGANIZATION>Teton Village</ORGANIZATION> boasts the longest vertical drop in 
the nation. Towering 10,000 feet over the village, the resort's <ORGANIZATION>Rendezvous 
Mountain</ORGANIZATION> offers a kaleidoscope of trails -- through powder bowls, gladed 
meadows and fragrant forests. 
</P>
<P>
All three resorts stage annual torchlight parades down mountain slopes as part 
of their <DATE>Christmas</DATE> and New Year's Eve festivities. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast to the area's stark, pastoral elegance, <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON> has a lively Wild 
West character. Covered wooden walkways, Western storefronts and a cluster of 
cowboy saloons create a rustic atmosphere. Huge arches of elk antlers mark the 
<PERSON>Jackson</PERSON> town square and serve as the <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON> logo. 
</P>
<P>
Restaurants such as the Silver Sage (on the south side of the square) and the 
<PERSON>Sojourner Stockman</PERSON>, at the <ORGANIZATION>Sojourner Inn</ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION>Teton Village</LOCATION>, specialize in steaks 
and barbecue. Others pride themselves on their au courant atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Mangy Moose Saloon 
</P>
<P>
 Off-Broadway</ORGANIZATION> (30 <ORGANIZATION>S. King St.</ORGANIZATION>, one block from the square) creates trendy fresh 
seafood and pasta dishes. The <ORGANIZATION>Cadillac Grille</ORGANIZATION> (on the west side of the square) 
fiddles with nouvelle cuisine in <LOCATION>Art Deco</LOCATION> interiors. You can sip a cappuccino 
at cozy Cafe Varnet (82 S. King St.) or nurse a beer at the popular <ORGANIZATION>Mangy Moose</ORGANIZATION> 
saloon at <LOCATION>Teton Village</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
For country music, check out the bands at the <ORGANIZATION>Million Dollar Cowboy Bar</ORGANIZATION> on the 
square or the Silver Dollar Bar in the historic Wort Hotel. The bars are 
embedded with silver dollars and the dance floors are swinging night spots. 
</P>
<P>
The largest herd of elk in <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION> winters on the northern edge of 
<LOCATION>Jackson</LOCATION>, protected by the <ORGANIZATION>National Elk Refuge</ORGANIZATION>. Schedule a picturesque sleigh 
ride into their midst at the refuge visitor center for close views. You'll see 
thousands of the animals in their own habitat, stags cracking horns, then 
locked in battle. 
</P>
<P>
Elk is what brought <PERSON>Margaret E.</PERSON> (<ORGANIZATION>Mardy</ORGANIZATION>) <PERSON>Murie</PERSON> here. Her husband, <PERSON>Olaus Murie</PERSON>, a 
field biologist for the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Biological Survey</ORGANIZATION>, came to study the declining elk 
herd in the <DATE>1920s</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Preservation Role 
</P>
<P>
His studies soon became world famous, and the two stayed to raise their family. 
<PERSON>Olaus Murie</PERSON> played an important role in preserving two major wilderness areas: 
Grand <ORGANIZATION>Teton National Park</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Arctic National Wildlife Refuge</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Margaret Murie</PERSON> made her own mark as teacher and author. ("Two in the Far 
North," describing her Alaskan childhood, is still in print.) 
</P>
<P>
With her special warmth and humble eloquence, <PERSON>Mardy</PERSON> is known as the 
conservationists' "grand doyenne." The salons in her log house tucked beneath 
the Tetons, on a bend in the river near the park visitor center in <LOCATION>Moose</LOCATION>, 
attract well-known political figures and naturalists. 
</P>
<P>
"Our problem now is not the amount of lands that are under state, private or 
federal jurisdiction, but whether we can keep our souls receptive to the 
message of peace this unspoiled landscape offers," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson Hole celebrates the grandeur of nature and the spirit of people acting 
for a noble cause. What's more, it's tops for winter recreation. 
</P>

   The book is called ``<LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION> Dan and His Search for Political
Par Excellence.'' In one part, ``<LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION> Dan,'' uses a magical golf
putter to play doubles against senators with partner ``Kennebunk

their state capitals, state nicknames and the dates their states
joined the union.
   At the bottom of each page are political quotes from famous

<P>
Back when she wrote a series of textbooks for the then-new course of 
environmental studies for <ORGANIZATION>Orange County</ORGANIZATION>'s public schools, biologist <PERSON>Karlin 
Marsh</PERSON> included a few chapters on community activism. 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen years later, she says, those chapters seem a little naive. 
</P>
<P>
"I've learned a lot in the intervening years," <PERSON>Marsh</PERSON>, 52, said wryly. "I've 
learned a lot about science and I've learned a lot about politics." 
</P>
<P>
For <PERSON>Marsh</PERSON>, a self-described "farm girl," those lessons have come from more than 
a dozen years of work in the environmental trenches, working as a consultant to 
some of the county's major developers and, more recently, to public agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Marsh's down-home bluntness occasionally has thrust her into the center of 
controversy. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, for example, <PERSON>Marsh</PERSON> and two other biologists warned in a report that 
a proposed 2,500-home development on the edge of <ORGANIZATION>O'Neill Regional Park</ORGANIZATION> would 
jeopardize one of <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION>'s richest natural habitats unless it were 
moved several hundred feet farther from the park. 
</P>
<P>
County land planners commissioned the report at a cost of <MONEY>$8,000</MONEY> but never 
formally presented it to the <ORGANIZATION>Planning Commission</ORGANIZATION>. A few weeks after the report 
became public, the commission, upon the recommendation of its staff, approved 
the proposed <ORGANIZATION>Las Flores Planned Community</ORGANIZATION> by a 5-0 vote. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioners cited the county's overriding need for more affordable housing 
and the <ORGANIZATION>Santa Margarita Co.</ORGANIZATION>'s pledge that <PERCENT>60%</PERCENT> of the homes would sell for less 
than <MONEY>$250,000</MONEY>, the average cost of a new house in the county. <ORGANIZATION>Santa Margarita 
Co.</ORGANIZATION> executives had dismissed <PERSON>Marsh</PERSON>'s report, noting that she had previously 
gone on record against the project. 
</P>
<P>
Marsh, a widely respected biologist who has worked as a consultant since the 
late <DATE>1970s</DATE>, previously declined comment on the <LOCATION>Las Flores</LOCATION> project. But she 
discussed herreport and the county's response during an interview <DATE>Monday</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Marsh, softly graying and given to folksy metaphors, said she was "disappointed 
for the critters" in O'Neill Regional Park but was not surprised by the 
commission's approval of the project. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes a whole lot more energy and time and -- sometimes -- money to make a 
difference in this county than I ever conceived of in the mid-<DATE>'70s</DATE>," <PERSON>Marsh</PERSON> 
said. "It's not easy for <PERSON>Joe Blow</PERSON> on Elm Street to make a difference anymore or 
even for very well organized environmental groups to make a difference. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I think <PERSON>Las Flores</PERSON> was a good example. Here you had some of the best field 
biologists in the area saying, 'Hey, there (are) problems here that need to be 
considered.' " 
</P>
<P>
The project still needs to be approved by the <ORGANIZATION>Board of Supervisors</ORGANIZATION>, which is 
scheduled to take up the proposal at its <DATE>Dec. 5</DATE> meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Marsh, who says she practices what she preaches, works out of her home, made of 
natural wood siding and set down into the hillside at the end of an unmarked 
dirt road in <LOCATION>Silverado Canyon</LOCATION>. Her office, at the top of her three-story home, 
rests above a canopy of oak trees. 
</P>
<P>
A creek with tiny rainbow trout gurgles about 100 feet from the house. From her 
window, she's far more likely to spot a chickadee than a fellow human. Her 
husband, <PERSON>Gordon Marsh</PERSON>, curator of <ORGANIZATION>UC Irvine's Museum of Systematic Biology</ORGANIZATION>, 
shares her love of nature and is likely to be seen roaming the grounds of their 
home in the <TIME>late afternoon</TIME>, sometimes in search of insects, which he collects. 
</P>
<P>
Her two children from a previous marriage, a son and a daughter, are grown and 
live in <LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Marsh is a transplant from <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION>, the daughter of an engineer who 
raised his family on a sheep farm because his wife was uncomfortable with 
crowds. 
</P>
<P>
Marsh graduated from <ORGANIZATION>Allegheny College</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Meadville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pa.</LOCATION>, and did some 
postgraduate work at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Pittsburgh</ORGANIZATION>. She came to <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> from 
<LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION> with her former husband, who was transferred here in the late 
<DATE>1960s</DATE>. She worked as a nature guide in <LOCATION>Orange County</LOCATION> parks and as an 
environmental education teacher in the county's public school system until the 
mid-1970s, when the first stirring of the environmental movement began. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Nathaniel Lamm</PERSON>, the school system's administrator of environmental education, 
recalled the public's heightened interest in teaching youngsters about the 
environment, but he noted the county's dearth of reference materials. Lamm 
turned to <LOCATION>Marsh</LOCATION>, whom he had met several years earlier while she was working 
for one of the county's nature conservancies and who seemed a natural for the 
job. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't really have a good reference point. That's where <PERSON>Karlin</PERSON> came about," 
<PERSON>Lamm</PERSON> recalled. "She is one of those rare individuals who can take something 
very technical and make it understandable. . . . She's very much in demand." 
</P>
<P>
Marsh eventually wrote three volumes, reprinted numerous times, that until a 
few years ago remained the principal reference books for environmental 
education in the county's schools at the elementary and junior high school 
levels. 
</P>
<P>
The first book provides an overview of the county's biological communities, the 
second provides a more detailed look at the county's coastal wetlands and 
mountain habitats, and the third looks at the effect of development and 
urbanization on the county's wildlife, <PERSON>Marsh</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
At the time <PERSON>Marsh</PERSON> was asked to write the reference, she was already bored with 
teaching and eager for a new challenge. 
</P>
<P>
"You can only give so many nature walks to little snappers," she quipped. "I 
figured there must be something more out there."

<HEAD>Habitat To Build 20 Atlanta Homes In Largest Project To Date</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOSEPH B. FRAZIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Habitat for <ORGANIZATION>Humanity</ORGANIZATION> announced <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> it will
build 20 homes for <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>'s working poor in a five-day crash
project starting <DATE>June 27</DATE>, the 12-year-old volunteer agency's most
ambitious project.
   The effort, named the <PERSON>Jimmy Carter</PERSON> Work Project '88 after
<PERSON>Habitat</PERSON>'s best-known volunteer, is intended ``to fill a void
between a market economy that does not reach down to some economic
classes and a government with other spending priorities,'' said
project director <PERSON>Bruce Gunter</PERSON>.
   <PERSON>Carter</PERSON> said Habitat ``arouses the conscience of the world to the
problem of the homeless'' and to the ``disgrace in our own rich
nation of the homeless situation.''
   The Americus-based Habitat has built more than 4,000 homes for
the working poor on a non-profit, no-interest basis since <DATE>1976</DATE> and
expects to complete 2,000 this year. It has chapters in 277
American cities and 26 other countries.
   Recipients of the homes, who have to help build them, pay back
the cost usually over 20 years with mortgages averaging <MONEY>$118</MONEY> a
month. The money goes into a revolving fund used to build more
houses. Most of the labor is volunteer.
   The houses are wood-frame structures designed to be simple but
adequate with all of the basics and few frills.
   Habitat has built 24 homes in <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> since it started in the
city in <DATE>1983</DATE> and hopes to complete 75 by <DATE>1990</DATE>. City figures show <PERCENT>31
percent</PERCENT> of <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>'s housing to be substandard, compared with a
nationwide average of <PERCENT>8 percent</PERCENT>.
   ``Habitat is doing what the federal, state and local governments
should be doing,'' said Mayor <PERSON>Andrew Young</PERSON>, who also is active in
the Habitat organization. ``Habitat is showing us the way.''
   So far 10 families have been picked for the 20 homes to be built
in the <MONEY>$600,000</MONEY> project.
   The first house has already been built to serve as the temporary
project office.
   After construction is over, <PERSON>Evelyn Jackson</PERSON> will move into the
three-bedroom house with her two children. The <ORGANIZATION>Oglethorpe
University</ORGANIZATION> housekeeper has lived all her life in the
down-at-the-edges southeast <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> neighborhood where the block of
homes will be built.
   ``This means I can keep my roots here,'' she said. `We helped
frame it up and insulate it.''
   ``There was a lot I didn't know and they showed me how,'' she
said. ``Now if something goes wrong maybe I can fix it myself.''
   Habitat also will build five row houses in <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> starting
<DATE>June 20</DATE> and has announced a 12-week, 1,200-mile march from
<LOCATION>Portland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION>, to <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> starting <DATE>June 26</DATE> during which Habitat
volunteers plan to build 120 homes and collect <MONEY>$1.2 million</MONEY> in
donations to initiate more construction.

<HEAD>Habitat for Humanity Will Mark 15th Anniversary With Building
Blitz</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AMERICUS, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Habitat for <ORGANIZATION>Humanity</ORGANIZATION> will celebrate its
15th anniversary next year by building 1,500 homes for the needy in
225 communities around the nation.
   Habitat said the 16-week building blitz will begin in <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> on
<DATE>June 16</DATE> and end in <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, with a three-day convention,
starting <DATE>Sept. 26</DATE>. Former President <PERSON>Carter</PERSON>, one of Habitat's
best-known volunteers, will be the keynote speaker at the meeting.
   During the anniversary project, 15 work teams will travel from
community to community, building new homes and renovating old ones,
Habitat officials said. Habitat will provide food, housing and
transportation.
   ``This will be the most exciting year in <LOCATION>Habitat</LOCATION> for Humanity's
history,'' said <PERSON>Millard Fuller</PERSON>, Habitat's president and co-founder.
   Fuller said the Christian housing group also plans to complete
its 10,000th home early in the year and to complete its 15,000th by
the end of the year.
   Volunteers build and renovate homes by using donated materials.
Recipients are required to work on their homes and the homes of
others. Houses are purchased on a non-profit, no-interest basis.

<HEAD>Hurricane Hugo Harmed Endangered Birds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hurricane Hugo took a devastating human toll,
but its victims also included rare and endangered birds such as the
<ORGANIZATION>Red Cockaded Woodpecker</ORGANIZATION>, which lost one of its few remaining
habitats in the killer storm.
   ``Some endangered species really took a heavy hit by Hugo,''
said <PERSON>Rudy Rosen</PERSON>, a biologist for the <ORGANIZATION>National Wildlife Federation</ORGANIZATION>,
which along with several government agencies has been trying to
catalog the loss.
   Perhaps no endangered bird fared as badly as the <ORGANIZATION>Red Cockaded
Woodpecker</ORGANIZATION>, a tiny bird that conservationists have been trying to
save from extinction for nearly two decades. In recent years its
decline had been halted with an estimated 2,000 woodpecker colonies
found mainly in three national forests.
   One sanctuary for about 500 woodpecker colonies was the
250,000-acre <ORGANIZATION>Frances Marrion National Forest</ORGANIZATION> just north of
<LOCATION>Charleston</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>S.C.</LOCATION>, where Hugo roared ashore last month.
   ``The forest was just wiped out. Trees on the ground, twisted
and uprooted,'' said <PERSON>Rosen</PERSON>. He said anywhere from one-fourth to
perhaps as many as three-fourths of the endangered woodpeckers in
the forest may have been killed. Those that lived through the storm
may not survive because most of the aging trees that were their
habitat no longer stand, he continued.
   ``We have lost potentially forever one of the most viable
populations of the <ORGANIZATION>Red Cockaded Woodpecker</ORGANIZATION> at a time when the
population is declining,'' said <PERSON>Rosen</PERSON>. The only other significant
habitats for the woodpeckers are national forests in <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION>
and <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>.
   The old-growth pine trees at the <PERSON>Marrion</PERSON> forest, which the
woodpeckers called home, were especially easy targets for Hugo
because many already had been weakened by the woodpecker's boring
of holes for nests.
   The <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Forest Service</ORGANIZATION> has been drilling artificial cavities
into remaining pine trees in hopes of accommodating the surviving
woodpeckers, but <PERSON>Rosen</PERSON> said it's unclear whether that will work
because the remaining trees are not ideal for woodpeckers' nesting.
He said other animals and birds, including squirrels and owls, may
compete for the man-made nests.
   But the <ORGANIZATION>Red Cockaded Woodpecker</ORGANIZATION> was not the only endangered bird
caught by Hugo.
   Even before Hugo raced onto the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> mainland, its victims in
the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> included the rare <LOCATION>Puerto Rican</LOCATION> wild parrot. Before
the storm, 47 of the endangered wild parrots were known to live in
the wild on the island.
   ``To date we have been able to locate 23 of the birds,'' said
<PERSON>Rosen</PERSON>. He said about <PERCENT>80 percent</PERCENT> of the bird's habitat was
defoliated when Hugo whipped across the island.
   Conservationists for a time thought the storm also had claimed
five rare red wolves on <LOCATION>Bull Island</LOCATION> near <LOCATION>Charleston</LOCATION>. The wolves
disappeared for days but later were found, said <PERSON>Rosen</PERSON>.
   Their loss would have been a major setback in efforts by the
<ORGANIZATION>Interior Department</ORGANIZATION> to reintroduce red wolves into the wild. Until
a few years ago the red wolf was considered extinct except for
those found in zoos.
   Today there are fewer than two dozen of the wolves believed to
be in the wild, says <PERSON>Bob Irvin</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Wildlife Federation</ORGANIZATION>.

FT  11 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Speculation rises over disposal of Habitat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRESH SPECULATION that the Storehouse retailing group was considering
selling its Habitat business circulated yesterday after a French newspaper
reported that Au Printemps was interested in buying Habitat's French arm.
Storehouse has suggested in the past that it might dispose of Habitat if a
suitable buyer could be found but declined to comment on the report. Au
Printemps, the French retailer owned by the <PERSON>Pinault</PERSON> group, also refused to
comment.
Analysts expressed surprise that <ORGANIZATION>Storehouse</ORGANIZATION> should consider selling Habitat
<LOCATION>France</LOCATION> individually - given that it was the most profitable part of the
furniture business - but suggested that any sale could realise up to Pounds
100m.
Ms <PERSON>Julie Ramshaw</PERSON>, retail analyst at stockbrokers <ORGANIZATION>Morgan Stanley</ORGANIZATION>, said: 'I do
not believe that <PERSON>Habitat</PERSON> has a long term future with the group but I do not
think there is any urgency about selling it.'

FT  20 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Storehouse/Ikea
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<PERSON>Mr David Dworkin</PERSON>, chief executive of <ORGANIZATION>Storehouse</ORGANIZATION>, must have his fingers
crossed. A deal to sell Habitat to <ORGANIZATION>Ikea</ORGANIZATION> would suit Storehouse nicely even
though the company does not particularly need the cash. Selling the British
and French chains at anything like the mooted Pounds 50m would easily fund
closure of Habitat in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>, which lost Pounds 8m last year. And though the
French business is profitable, the <ORGANIZATION>UK</ORGANIZATION> has long been a headache the company
could live without.
By the same token it is difficult to see what <ORGANIZATION>Ikea</ORGANIZATION> sees in <LOCATION>Habitat</LOCATION>. There
are superficial similarities between the two chains, but they hide more than
they reveal. <ORGANIZATION>Ikea</ORGANIZATION>'s vast furniture barns contrast with Habitat's mix of high
street and edge-of-town locations. The logistics of handling a pan-European
chain with half a dozen UK outlets are also very different to managing some
70 Habitat stores. While the worst may be over at <LOCATION>Habitat</LOCATION>, this could be a
deal which <ORGANIZATION>Ikea</ORGANIZATION> lives to regret.
If a contract is signed, <PERSON>Mr Dworkin</PERSON> can concentrate on wringing profits out
of <ORGANIZATION>Mothercare</ORGANIZATION> in the no-holds-barred manner which proved so successful at
BhS. Better buying, distribution, pricing, layout, management and marketing
would transform <ORGANIZATION>Mothercare</ORGANIZATION>'s prospects. Yet with the shares on a multiple of
27 times this year's estimated earnings, plenty of recovery is already in
the price. And investors may wonder how Marks and <PERSON>Spencer</PERSON> intends to respond
to the revival of BhS.

HOFFMASTER STATE PARK, Mich. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The theater is darkened, engulfed in the sound of crashing waves, as the story 
of sand dune creation unfolds on screen. First comes formation of the beach -- 
fore dune, trough, back dune and barrier dune. A fragile environment springs to 
life next, grasses at first, followed by woody plants and eventually a forest 
of hemlock and sugar maple on the back and barrier dunes. 
</P>
<P>
The theater is part of this 1,054-acre park established in <DATE>1967</DATE> to protect and 
preserve <LOCATION>Lake Michigan</LOCATION>'s 2 1/2-mile stretch of towering sand dunes. The park's 
centerpiece is the 13-year-old <ORGANIZATION>Genevieve Gillette Nature Center</ORGANIZATION>, a <MONEY>$500,000</MONEY> 
complex including the Sand Dune Theater dedicated to the interpretation of sand 
piles. 
</P>
<P>
"Dunes are home to many unique plants and animals," said <PERSON>Earl Wolf</PERSON>, 37, a park 
naturalist here for the last 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
The giant sand piles along the eastern shore of <LOCATION>Lake Michigan</LOCATION> collectively 
represent the world's largest accumulation of sand dunes bordering fresh water. 
<LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>, with its unique Sand <ORGANIZATION>Dune Protection and Management Statute</ORGANIZATION>, has 
275,000 acres of sand dunes, <PERCENT>40%</PERCENT> in public ownership. 
</P>
<P>
Snow often covers the dunes this time of year and visitors can be seen 
navigating the park's 10-mile trail on snow shoes or skis. They are accompanied 
by a symphony of chirping birds -- including black cap chickadees, 
white-breasted nut hatches, tufted titmice, blue jays, red-bellied woodpeckers 
and meadowlarks -- and squirrels who scamper across the snow amid a maze tracks 
left by red fox and white-tail deer. 
</P>
<P>
Soon, tiny <DATE>spring</DATE> peeper frogs will be peeping robustly as colorful painted 
turtles scurry about with spotted salamanders and other wildlife. And as the 
snow melts, visitors to the ice-clogged shoreline will experience "singing 
sand," a sound heard few places on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very special tune played by the sand," said park ranger <PERSON>Elizabeth 
Brockwell</PERSON>, 23. "You scoot your feet along the beach and when the right amount 
of moisture is present, tiny sand particles scrape against each other and emit 
a peculiar musical whistle or squeaking sound." 
</P>
<P>
The center is filled with graphics describing dune formation and growth here 
and throughout the world. Exhibits portray plants and animals found in sand 
dune ecosystems and a gallery is devoted to works by <PERSON>Jeanne Rockette</PERSON> and other 
<LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> sand dune artists. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors, including thousands of schoolchildren, ascend the wooden Dune Climb 
Stairway that winds to the top of 220-foot-high Sugar Hill and overlooks 
190-foot Mt. Baldy and a breathtaking sweep one of <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>'s most scenic 
beaches. 
</P>
<P>
The park is named after the late P. J. (Pete) <PERSON>Hoffmaster</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>'s first 
superintendent of parks; the sand dune museum in honor of <PERSON>Genevieve Gillette</PERSON>, 
who died two years ago at 88. 
</P>
<P>
Known as <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>'s "Miss State Park," <ORGANIZATION>Gillette</ORGANIZATION> was the first woman to receive 
a degree in landscape architecture at an American university (<ORGANIZATION>Michigan State</ORGANIZATION>). 
From the <DATE>1920s</DATE> until her death, she was a leader in establishing <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>'s 
park system. <ORGANIZATION>Gillette</ORGANIZATION> wrote <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>'s wilderness bill, was the first president 
of <ORGANIZATION>Michigan's Parks Assn.</ORGANIZATION> and was named to the 12-member <ORGANIZATION>Citizen's Advisory

<TEXT>
Hats off to <LOCATION>Storehouse</LOCATION> for some pretty impressive dealing. To get Pounds 78m
for a problem-child like Habitat, which the Storehouse management does not
have time to fix, must be satisfying. Finding someone to buy the
surplus-to-requirements <PERSON>Richards</PERSON> chain for an equally full Pounds 30m is all
the more so. Of course both <ORGANIZATION>Sears</ORGANIZATION>, the proud new owners of <PERSON>Richards</PERSON>, and the
<ORGANIZATION>Stichting Ingka Foundation</ORGANIZATION>, which has bought Habitat, have reasons for their
purchases. <ORGANIZATION>Sears</ORGANIZATION> can argue that <PERSON>Richards</PERSON> fills a gap in its coverage of the
womenswear market, while the <ORGANIZATION>SIF</ORGANIZATION> wants to develop a furniture brand to
complement its <ORGANIZATION>Ikea</ORGANIZATION> stores.
Both will have to work hard to justify the price they have paid, but <ORGANIZATION>SIF</ORGANIZATION> has
the more difficult task. True, the foundation is not publicly quoted and so
perhaps can afford to take a relaxed view, but sorting out Habitat's
troubles is a rather different proposition from that of exporting the
successful <ORGANIZATION>Ikea</ORGANIZATION> idea. With much apparently expected of the current Habitat
management, they will have to come up with better ideas than the failed move
into edge-of-town sheds.
Storehouse is left with some cash, and two businesses which it argues fit
logically together. Both BhS and <ORGANIZATION>Mothercare</ORGANIZATION> sell to families with young
children and aim to buy on advantageous terms because of the group's size.
Storehouse must make those backstage savings work if it is to avoid the
notion that once <ORGANIZATION>Mothercare</ORGANIZATION> has been sorted out it should go the way of
Habitat and <PERSON>Richards</PERSON>.

FT  27 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Aiming to shake the shabby out of Habitat -
The history and future of a sixties trendsetter which lost its way in the
eighties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NOBODY WHO grew up in the post-Habitat era can possibly imagine what it was
like to try to furnish a house before the youthful <PERSON>Terence Conran</PERSON> opened his
very first Habitat store in <LOCATION>Fulham Road</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> in the dazzling <DATE>spring of
1964</DATE>.
If middle-class <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> had a furnishing style in those post-war years, it
was either hand-me-down Brideshead or department store repro.
In the late eighties it became fashionable to mock it, to make jolly little
jokes about Shabitat, and to avow one never went near the place.
But its arrival marked a turning point in the tastes and life-styles of the
middle-classes. For the first time there was somewhere where they could go
where nothing jarred, where the salad bowls were perfectly turned, the
casseroles were authentic peasant ware from <LOCATION>Provence</LOCATION>, and where even the
wooden spoons seemed to evoke a simpler, better, more sun-filled way of
life.
Sir <PERSON>Terence</PERSON>'s peculiar talent was for turning his own tastes and life-style,
his nostalgia for French rustic life, into a highly commercial operation so
that middle-class urban dwellers in <LOCATION>Islington</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Chelsea</PERSON> came to fill their
homes with chicken bricks and tangines, with pale pine tables and petits
pots a la creme.
The single store blossomed into a chain, the chain prospered but, as <PERSON>Ian
Renwick</PERSON>, head of corporate communications at <LOCATION>Habitat</LOCATION>, puts it: '<DATE>Three years
ago</DATE> we fell off a precipice.' Profits plunged leading to losses of Pounds
8.8m in <DATE>1989</DATE> and Pounds 11.9m in <DATE>1990</DATE>. Somewhere along the road the dream
had gone wrong.
In recent months it has been no secret that <PERSON>Storehouse</PERSON>, the parent company,
had been looking for a buyer. Now we know that <ORGANIZATION>Stichting Ingka Foundation</ORGANIZATION>,
the trust started by <PERSON>Ingvar Kamprad</PERSON>, founder of <ORGANIZATION>Ikea</ORGANIZATION>, the Swedish furnishing
chain, has bought it.
At Habitat headquarters the mood is buoyant.
'We can now get on with running the business,' says <PERSON>Vittorio Radice</PERSON>,
recently installed as managing director, after two years with the group
first as merchandise manager and then as buying director. 'Without any
politics, with no looking at short-term profit. The <ORGANIZATION>Foundation</ORGANIZATION> sees the
future of Habitat very much as we do and is prepared to invest in the
future.
'<ORGANIZATION>The Foundation</ORGANIZATION> sees Habitat and <ORGANIZATION>Ikea</ORGANIZATION> as two completely separate brands and
we will be run quite separately from <ORGANIZATION>Ikea</ORGANIZATION>. Whereas <ORGANIZATION>Ikea</ORGANIZATION> goes in for 200,000
sq ft self-service style stores, eventually I want all our stores to revert
to being smaller, fully serviced stores with high quality sales staff.'
Out has gone the mail order (too down-market), out the polyester bedlinen
(nothing but <PERCENT>100%</PERCENT> cotton bedlinen from now on), out the melamine and the
self-assembly furniture ('unless a piece of furniture is born to be
self-assembly').
'Already,' says <PERSON>Mr Radice</PERSON>, 'we have turned the corner. Sometime around <DATE>May
last year</DATE> it seemed to happen.'
He waves yesterday's figures jubilantly. 'Just look at this - yesterday we
were 26 per cent ahead of the same <DATE>Sunday</DATE> last year whilst for the whole
week we are 7.4 per cent ahead of the equivalent week last year. Habitat is
in line to return to profit.'
Quite why and how the chain lost its way, or more accurately, failed to
evolve, is a matter of some dispute.
<PERSON>Mr Radice</PERSON> is in no doubt. 'Habitat today could be the best home furnishings
chain in the world if the original concept hadn't been murdered. When
<PERSON>Terence Conran</PERSON> first opened stores they were in beautiful buildings - a
restored church in <PERSON>Tunbridge Wells</PERSON>, a 1920s cinema in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s Road,
a grand hotel in <LOCATION>Bristol</LOCATION>, an old Spitfire factory in <LOCATION>Manchester</LOCATION> - all these
were wonderful, individual, special to their towns.
'Then they started opening in huge sheds in edge of town sites, next door to
<ORGANIZATION>B&amp;Q</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>MFI</ORGANIZATION>, Do-It-All. They even opened seven Habitat stores in BhS. All this
diluted the image, took it down-market. I think that was a tremendous
mistake.
'When I arrived I asked whom they saw as their competition. The Reject Shop,
<ORGANIZATION>MFI</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>John Lewis</PERSON> I was told. I knew at once I had to do something.'
What <PERSON>Vittorio Radice</PERSON> is determined to do it is to win back the market it
should never have lost in the first place.
'We aim to have 50 stores in this country, of which 20 will be new and
another 10 of the existing stores will be relocated. It will be an
evolutionary process with, I hope, no redundancies. In fact we hope to
create jobs.
'I want the stores to be no bigger than 10,000 sq ft, small enough to retain
an individual, characterful mood, with each store listening closely to the
needs of its own customers.'
Habitat is, if you like, returning to its roots, going back, after a painful
detour, to where it all began. Those who remember the original Habitat store
in the <LOCATION>Fulham Road</LOCATION>, where <PERSON>Joseph</PERSON> stands today, remember one really terrific
shop showing what it could be like if everything was all of a piece, if one
consistent, sure taste lay behind it all.
Times have moved on, tastes have changed, but the original blueprint is
still <PERSON>Mr Radice</PERSON>'s guiding light. 'I remember when I was with <ORGANIZATION>AMC Milan</ORGANIZATION> (a
large Italian furniture buying organisation where <PERSON>Mr Radice</PERSON> worked for seven
years) I used to come from <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> just to see Habitat because it was the
retailing phenomenon of its time. Then in the mid <DATE>1980s</DATE> I stopped coming.
Well, I want people like me to feel they have to come and see what Habitat
is up to again.'

   A siren-red, sequin-encrusted evening gown that
gentlemen preferred to see <PERSON>Marilyn Monroe</PERSON> wearing fetched <MONEY>$14,300</MONEY>
at an auction of Hollywood memorabilia.
   The dress worn in ``Gentlemen Prefer Blondes'' was sold <DATE>Friday</DATE>
to an unidentified buyer at <ORGANIZATION>Sotheby</ORGANIZATION>'s auction house. The
unidentified seller also threw in a Life magazine cover showing
<PERSON>Miss Monroe</PERSON> in the gown and <PERSON>Jane Russell</PERSON> in an identical one.
   A white lace bustier, which <PERSON>Miss Monroe</PERSON> wore under a different
gown in the <DATE>1960</DATE> movie ``Let's Make Love,'' went for <MONEY>$1,430</MONEY>. And a
black bra, of unspecified origin but inscribed with the sex
symbol's name, sold for <MONEY>$605</MONEY>.
   The beauty got some competition from a beast: a rubber monster
head from the <DATE>1954</DATE> movie, ``The Creature of the Black Lagoon.'' A
Canadian private collector got it for <MONEY>$5,610</MONEY> _ well above the
pre-sale estimate of <MONEY>$2,000</MONEY> to <MONEY>$3,000</MONEY>.
   The monster mask, in fetching sea green with red lips, is
highlighted by ``many gills to the back'' and large moles, the
auction catalog notes. When not being worn, it can be displayed in
its own clear case.
   A Salvador Dali backdrop from <PERSON>Alfred Hitchcock</PERSON>'s ``Spellbound,''
valued at <MONEY>$60,000</MONEY> to <MONEY>$80,000</MONEY>, was bought back when it failed to
make the undisclosed minimum. So was a navy blue and white checked,
cotton pinafore worn by <PERSON>Judy Garland</PERSON> in the ``Wizard of Oz,'' which
the auctioneers had hoped would go for <MONEY>$20,000</MONEY> to <MONEY>$25,000</MONEY>.
   But an anonymous buyer paid <MONEY>$6,600</MONEY> for a leather chariot toga
worn by <PERSON>Charlton Heston</PERSON> in ``<PERSON>Ben Hur</PERSON>,'' circa <DATE>1959</DATE>. Brown leather
forearm covers and a blue, 9-foot cape complete the macho ensemble.
   And <ORGANIZATION>W.C. Fields</ORGANIZATION>'s top hat from the <DATE>1939</DATE> movie, ``My Little
Chickadee,'' went for <MONEY>$3,300</MONEY> to a private collector _ a bargain,
below the estimate of <MONEY>$4,000</MONEY> to <MONEY>$6,000</MONEY>.
   The Hollywood mementos were part of Sotheby's annual Collector's
Carrousel sale that also includes toys, dolls, animated art, music
boxes and baseball memorabilia. The sale continued today.

FT  19 OCT 92 / International Company News: Storehouse in talks for sale of
Habitat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STOREHOUSE, the <ORGANIZATION>UK</ORGANIZATION> retailing group, is negotiating the sale of Habitat, its
home furnishing chain, to <ORGANIZATION>Ikea</ORGANIZATION>, the Swedish furniture retailer.
Talks are also being held with <ORGANIZATION>Sears</ORGANIZATION>, the retail and mail order group, which
is understood to be interested in buying <PERSON>Richards</PERSON>, the <LOCATION>Storehouse</LOCATION> women's
wear business.
City analysts estimate the two deals could raise up to Pounds 70m for
Storehouse, though the negotiations have yet to resolve a number of 'issues
of substance', according to one source.
Habitat, founded by Sir <PERSON>Terence Conran</PERSON>, was one of the high street successes
of the <DATE>1960s</DATE> and early <DATE>1970s</DATE>. Its cheap, well-designed furnishings
epitomised the lifestyle of young professional people.
It failed, however, to keep pace with the retail revolution it helped to
create. In the <DATE>past two years</DATE>, it has closed a quarter of its UK stores and
losses have amounted to more than Pounds 20m.
Habitat's French operations, in which Au Printemps, the French retailer, was
recently reported to be interested, are profitable; but the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> business lost
Pounds 7.7m last year.
<ORGANIZATION>Ikea</ORGANIZATION> has prospered in the UK since it opened its first superstore at
<LOCATION>Warrington</LOCATION> <DATE>five years ago</DATE>. It was ranked the country's sixth largest
furniture retailer last year despite having just three stores. Since then,
it has opened a fourth at <LOCATION>Gateshead</LOCATION>, and is due to open another at <LOCATION>Croydon</LOCATION>
next month. Its out-of-town stores, with facilities such as children's
playgrounds and family restaurants, represented 'what Habitat might have
been,' said one analyst.
Storehouse declined to comment on the Habitat disposal yesterday but <PERSON>Mr
David Dworkin</PERSON>, who became chief executive of <ORGANIZATION>Storehouse</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>July</DATE>, has
indicated that the core of the group's future operations would be BhS and
<ORGANIZATION>Mothercare</ORGANIZATION>, each serving mass markets in clothing.
Storehouse, which showed signs of recovery with pre-tax profits of Pounds
15.8m last year, is expected to register a small loss during the first half
of the current year.

<TEXT>
   Timber man <PERSON>Jim Coleman</PERSON>'s boot makes the
same print in the forest floor as biologist <PERSON>Ralph Costa</PERSON>'s, and both
men call themselves environmentalists.
   The similarities end when they talk about a humble little bird
called the red-cockaded woodpecker and the complex new rules to
preserve a million acres of Southern pine woods for the endangered
creature's home.
   Three logging contracts signed by <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON>'s small company were
scrapped when the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Forest Service</ORGANIZATION> regulations changed to give
the bird more space, and he sees layoffs looming in the region's
biggest industry.
   ``If we were out there destroying the environment, that'd be one
thing,'' says <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON>, whose <ORGANIZATION>Callahan Timber Co.</ORGANIZATION> planted more than
1 million seedlings last year. ``We're at a loss. We don't
understand.''
   Costa, who oversees a program to save the woodpecker in the
<ORGANIZATION>Appalachicola National Forest</ORGANIZATION> 200 miles away, says timber interests
alone must not drive decisions about federal woodlands.
   ``Public lands are going to be the last places that things
survive, pieces of the world _ whether it's a woodpecker or a bald
eagle,'' he said. ``They're the bastions.''
   Disagreement about the red-cockaded woodpecker has generated
legal briefs and government studies that now stack up well over the
bird's seven-inch height.
   The species, named for the tiny badges of red plumage behind the
male's eyes, has been on the endangered list since <DATE>1970</DATE>.
   Perhaps 10,000 birds remain, the rest falling prey to flying
squirrels, snakes and even other woodpeckers that take over the
cavities they painstakingly dig in living pine trees.
   Man, often unwittingly, has been the birds' adversary, too,
consuming much of their habitat _ parklike stands of old pines to
nest in and enough surrounding woods to forage for insects, find
mates and expand their clans.
   As the <LOCATION>Sun Belt</LOCATION>'s population has grown, developers have turned
woods into housing tracts. Loggers have replaced swaths of old
forest with tree crops, raised and cut in cycles.
   And the government routinely has extinguished the fires caused
by lightning that actually helped the woodpecker by burning out
hardwoods that <DATE>spring</DATE> up beneath tall pines, blocking nest cavities
and giving predators easier access.
   ``By far the largest factor has been clearcutting, destruction
of the habitat and suppression of fire,'' says <PERSON>Doug Honnold</PERSON> of the
<ORGANIZATION>Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund</ORGANIZATION>.
   The group accused the <ORGANIZATION>Forest Service</ORGANIZATION> in a lawsuit of
jeopardizing the species in <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, and in <DATE>1988</DATE>, a judge agreed,
banning clearcutting and other timber industry methods within
three-quarters of a mile of woodpecker colony sites. The case is on
appeal.
   After a similar suit was threatened concerning national forests
in eight other Southern states, the agency last year applied a
three-quarter-mile protection zone to those areas, too.
   It then was the timber industry's turn to sue, citing the <ORGANIZATION>Forest
Service</ORGANIZATION>'s historic mandate ``to furnish a continuous supply of
timber.''
   It also contended the agency had failed to fully implement
earlier, less restrictive guidelines for the bird, and hadn't
followed required procedures in changing the rules.
   ``Unfortunately, we're fighting procedure versus emotion,'' says
<PERSON>Deborah Baker</PERSON> of the Atlanta-based industry group that filed suit,
the <ORGANIZATION>Forest Service Timber Purchasers Council</ORGANIZATION>.
   The three-quarter-mile radius encompasses 1,100 acres. That's
1.2 million acres for all the known colonies, compared with 502,000
restricted acres under the previous rules, which set only a
half-mile zone, according to the <ORGANIZATION>American Forest Council</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Ron Escano</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>Forest Service</ORGANIZATION> official in charge of protecting
endangered species in the Southeast, says the acreage was added to
give the birds space to expand colonies, not merely maintain
existing ones. In all but three national forests that have the
woodpeckers, the population seemed to be declining under the old
rules, he says.
   The new rules are interim measures while a two-year
environmental impact assessment is completed, he says.
   Meanwhile, Escano insists, timber cutting can occur within the
current zones _ ``it's just that it has to be designed to benefit
the woodpecker.''
   Asked about the industry's complaint that the new rules reduced
timber harvests by a total of 73 million board feet this year and
last, <PERSON>Escano</PERSON> says, ``In relation to total volume cut ... it's quite
small.''
   He acknowledges, however, ``If you look at individual forests
and individual operators, it could be a very different story.''
   According to <PERSON>Michael Sparks</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Forest Service</ORGANIZATION> timber sales
official, the impact will be greatest in coastal areas from <LOCATION>East
Texas</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION>.
   In <DATE>fiscal 1989</DATE>, about 1.2 billion board feet of timber was cut
on Southeast national forests, a drop from the previous five years.
The value fell to <MONEY>$76.8 million</MONEY> after hovering around <MONEY>$100 million</MONEY>
annually through that period.
   Woodpecker protection is certainly not the only factor
influencing volume, but the new guidelines are being felt.
   <PERSON>Jim Coleman</PERSON> doesn't know how much it cost <ORGANIZATION>Callahan Timber</ORGANIZATION> when
three contracts for northern <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Osceola National Forest</ORGANIZATION> were
canceled and then renegotiated because of the rule change.
   ``It's really hurt the industry down here,'' he says. ``When you
pull timber off the market, then this timber has to be found
somewhere _ and if it can't be found, then these mills start
shutting down.''
   One mill he's thinking of is a utility-pole operation owned
jointly by <ORGANIZATION>Callahan Timber</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Richard Cochran</PERSON>.
   Cochran echoes a complaint often heard in timbering areas, that
the bird is really a surrogate, ``a tool ... for people who just
don't want to cut any timber.''
   ``If we could reason with each other, we should have enough
middle ground,'' he says.
   ``No, the time for compromise is over,'' says <PERSON>Gary Henry</PERSON>, who
oversees red-cockaded woodpecker preservation for the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Fish and
<ORGANIZATION>Wildlife Service</ORGANIZATION>. ``That's what's been occurring for years ...
hoping that this was adequate for the woodpecker. It's very obvious
today that it is not adequate.''
   Couldn't the industry simply turn to private lands for raw
material?
   There are 164 million acres of private timberland in the
Southeast, many times the total national forest acreage, according
to the <ORGANIZATION>American Forest Council</ORGANIZATION>. But much private land is less
carefully managed and quality is often lower, industry officials
say.
   <PERSON>Ralph Costa</PERSON> drives past miles of private timberlands, paper
company plantations, on his commute to work in the <ORGANIZATION>Appalachicola
National Forest</ORGANIZATION>, home to 1,000 or so of the woodpeckers, more than
anywhere else. It doesn't bother him to see trees cut on private
land.
   But, he says, ``I don't think that national forests or any
public lands, for that matter, should necessarily have an objective
of producing a cash crop.''
   Deer hunting is permitted to thin herds. ``Cutting a tree ought
to be the same way. We ought to take trees for the health of the
ecosystem,'' says <PERSON>Costa</PERSON>, who's often in the woods before dawn to
band red-cockadeds or move birds from his forest to others,
sometimes providing mates in colonies that have dwindled to a
single bird.
   ``People ask me what's the value of a woodpecker,'' <ORGANIZATION>Costa</ORGANIZATION> says,
answering with an analogy: ``You can take a nice fancy spider web
and start cutting the threads. You're going to clip one thread
eventually and the spider web is going to collapse.
   ``And we can keep throwing species off the planet, which we're
doing, and eventually something's going to go wrong.''

<HL> LEISURE &amp; ARTS -- Gardening: The Art of Bird-Gardening </HL>
<AUTHOR> Patti Hagan </AUTHOR>

<DATELINE> Brooklyn, N.Y.  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senior American birdman <PERSON>Roger Tory Peterson</PERSON> characterizes as "bird gardeners" people who sow their gardens "not only with flowers but also with cardinals, orioles, jays, bluebirds, purple finches and goldfinches." 
At this time of year I birdgarden almost as much as I flower-garden, getting permissive and allowing a lot of questionable plants -- pokeweed, smartweed, nightshade, thistles -- to continue in my garden by way of bird fodder. 
Bird gardeners also have the habit of putting up bird houses for any birds who'd care to share the address. 
Usually these are miniatures made in the image of the suburban box -- detached dwellings, no row birdhouses, no bird duplexes -- except, of course, for purple martin condos. 

   A couple of years ago I found an Aframe birdhouse out on the street with a neighbor's trash. 
Not wanting to be responsible for more homeless birds in this city, I retrieved it and relocated it in the old crab apple out back. 
Possibly because it was rather small -- an S.R.O. -- no birds ever moved in and nested there. 
However, nearby in the <PERSON>Dorothy Perkins</PERSON> rambler rose thicket that same <DATE>spring</DATE>, I caught a pair of cardinals nest-making with <PERCENT>50%</PERCENT> man-made plastic fast-food detritus off <LOCATION>Flatbush Avenue</LOCATION>. 
Right then I vowed to do my best to get the birds of <LOCATION>Brooklyn</LOCATION> back to basics: wholesome, organic, all-natural nesting materials. 

   To this end I let dandelions have their powderpuff heads and certain rogue grasses thrive along the bluestone path. 
I did not dispose of old fern fronds and broken twigs if I thought they could be bird-useful. 
Even so, this <DATE>spring</DATE>, while flipping through a gardening catalog, I was delighted to find an all-natural product called <ORGANIZATION>Samson Nesting Material</ORGANIZATION>. 
Six dollars would buy "enough . . . to build 12 nests." 

   The "sterilized" nesting material arrived, late <DATE>April</DATE>, in a cardinal-red box: "feathers, moss, hair, string, cotton" packaged by a company called <ORGANIZATION>Wildlife Products</ORGANIZATION> (P.O. 
Box 363, <LOCATION>Wisconsin Rapids</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wis.</LOCATION> 54494). 
There was a lot of copy to read on the box, with key phrases ("Blended to Attract Colorful Songbirds of <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION>" and "Watch the Birds Build a Nest!") repeated on two sides. 
The stuff was, the box said, "designed to be perfect for bluebirds, robins, wrens, chickadees, finches, martins, cardinals and hummingbirds." 
Since the only species observed nesting in these parts during my tenure have been robins, mockingbirds, cardinals and mourning doves, I was eager to believe that "more than 50 species of North American birds will use this nesting material." 

   After studying "Some Ways to Present Nesting Material," I chose the "Directly on Ground" method, described as "the most natural way for birds." 
Within an hour of informal presentation, several songbirds not mentioned in the prospectus of coming bird attractions hit on the nesting goods. 
Starlings! 
Choosy starlings. 
Very quickly they made off with all the white bird feathers. 
Nothing else. 
The robins, cardinals, mockingbirds, catbirds were not interested, to say nothing of any of the 45 other songsters I could wish. (My cat, Be-bop, picked out the string to play with.) 

   Two months have passed, the first broods of robins and cardinals have fledged, and the mound of authentic, old-fashioned nesting material remains directly on the ground between a rock and a hard place, getting more unsterile by the day. 
Contemplating my backyard wildness, I was puzzled as to why so many songbirds would pass up such good mail-order fixings until I went back to the red box for further reading: "In a yard that is kept 'spick and span' the birds will not be able to find the natural materials they need to build their nests." (Clearly I have the wrong gardening style for the product.) 

   This insight set me to rummaging in the "Bird Homes" chapter of <PERSON>Margaret McKenny</PERSON>'s <DATE>1939</DATE> book "Birds in the Garden." 
There I read: "In the scrupulously tidied garden birds often have difficulty in finding materials with which to build their nests . . . 
In the modern, well-cared-for garden, every decayed branch has been removed, every cavity has been filled and all dead trees are immediately cut down." 

   Not so in this modern garden, which tends toward laissez-faire. 
No way can it be cited for spick and span. 
The two main trunks of the crab have fallen in the past three years and remain on the horizontal, where clematis and wisteria can engulf them. 
They are well-rotted and favored feeding stations for yellow-shafted flickers and downy woodpeckers. 
They also grow lovely rippled fungus borders. 
Birds have dropped wild multiflora rose seed near the house and now the multifloras have climbed the deck, raddling with the Asiatic bittersweet, and making an impenetrable nesting thicket plus producing little red rose hips. (And all along I had the habit of sharing the plush white hair of my late Samoyed, <LOCATION>Tofu</LOCATION>, with the birds during the dog's awesome spring sheddings.) 

   And then there's the moss. 
A while ago, inspired by the <ORGANIZATION>Moss Temple</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Kyoto</LOCATION>, I dedicated a small patch of my garden to moss. 
I sank a roasting pan and laid on rehydrated sphagnum sheet moss for a moss pond, which soon grew to have thickly moussed, brilliant green verges. 
Robins make bold to strip mine my moss -- it has been the stuffing of countless robins' nests these past five years -- such that by early <DATE>June</DATE> the moss pond is revealed for the dark blue, white-speckled turkey roasting pan that it is. 
Never mind. 

   However, I'm assuming that low maintenance, spick-and-span gardeners are in the majority nowadays. 
And it is for them that <ORGANIZATION>Samson Nesting Material</ORGANIZATION> was conceived. 
The spick-and-spanners can keep their tidy garden ways and still put out the messy stuff of bird domesticity. 
After all, as <PERSON>Margaret McKenny</PERSON> observed: "A garden without birds would be a semi-desert from the esthetic standpoint."

FT  20 OCT 92 / Ikea's logic furnishes a market riddle: John Thornhill
describes a curious interest in Habitat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As a rallying cry it is less than impressive. As a statement of intent it
has proved remarkably effective: 'We shall offer a wide range of home
furnishing items of good design and function, at prices so low, that the
majority of people can afford to buy them'.
The words are those of <PERSON>Mr Ingvar Kamprad</PERSON>, the Swedish entrepreneur,
outlining the business philosophy behind <ORGANIZATION>Ikea</ORGANIZATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Ikea</ORGANIZATION> is the privately owned furniture retailer, which, in four decades, has
grown from a single store in <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION>'s backwoods to become one of the most
successful international retailers in the world.
At the end of <DATE>last year</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Ikea</ORGANIZATION> ran more than 100 outlets in 25 countries,
with annual sales of SKr22.3bn (Pounds 2.2bn).
The company's vast blue and yellow retail sheds selling about 11,000
strangely named furniture products, such as Orgryte sofas and Smedvik dining
tables, are a feature of the international retailing landscape. Yet the
company's remarkable expansion is due largely to organic growth.
<ORGANIZATION>Ikea</ORGANIZATION>'s reported interest in buying the UK and French arms of the struggling
Habitat chain, owned by <ORGANIZATION>Storehouse</ORGANIZATION>, has therefore inspired considerable
curiosity, and even outright puzzlement, within the furniture retailing
industry.
<PERSON>Mr Richard Hyman</PERSON>, director of Verdict, the retail consultants, says: 'The
possible acquisition has no commercial logic at all. If <ORGANIZATION>Ikea</ORGANIZATION> has a spare
Pounds 50m to invest, I would have thought they would have done better to
continue expanding what is clearly an outstandingly successful format,
rather than buying a loss-making high street chain which provides very weak
competition.'
Such sentiments are expressed in slightly more muted form even within the
<ORGANIZATION>Ikea Group</ORGANIZATION>. The furniture company's headquarters in <LOCATION>Denmark</LOCATION> yesterday
continued to deny all knowledge of the possible acquisition of Habitat. Its
UK business was similarly baffled.
A clue to the conundrum may lie in the fact that <LOCATION>Storehouse</LOCATION> is conducting
talks with the <ORGANIZATION>Ikea Foundation</ORGANIZATION> rather than with the <ORGANIZATION>Ikea Group</ORGANIZATION> itself. The
<ORGANIZATION>Ikea Foundation</ORGANIZATION>, set up by <PERSON>Mr Kamprad</PERSON>, is the legal owner of the furniture
group and is responsible for other activities, including the disbursement of
awards every three years to improve the quality of life and the environment.
The idiosyncratic <PERSON>Mr Kamprad</PERSON> may therefore be conducting the discussions
through the foundation without telling his colleagues in the furniture
group. He has certainly expressed a personal interest in Habitat before.
Three years ago, when <PERSON>Storehouse</PERSON> came under siege from the corporate raider,
<PERSON>Mr Asher Edelman</PERSON>, <PERSON>Mr Kamprad</PERSON> contacted the company and asked if he could buy
the furniture chain.
<PERSON>Mr Michael Julien</PERSON>, then chief executive of <ORGANIZATION>Storehouse</ORGANIZATION>, visited <LOCATION>Denmark</LOCATION> to
discuss the deal with <ORGANIZATION>Ikea</ORGANIZATION>, but it faded away. So did the threat from <PERSON>Mr
Edelman</PERSON>.
Sir <PERSON>Terence Conran</PERSON>, the former chief executive of Storehouse and the guiding
spirit behind Habitat, said <ORGANIZATION>Ikea</ORGANIZATION> then believed it could use Habitat to
expand into a different segment of the UK furniture market. 'They saw that
Habitat could be the leading edge of <ORGANIZATION>Ikea</ORGANIZATION> giving the group an up-market high
street presence,' he said yesterday, emphasising that he had no knowledge of
the current talks.
At the end of <DATE>March</DATE>, Habitat was running 40 stores in the <ORGANIZATION>UK</ORGANIZATION>, after slimming
down the chain in recent years in the face of recession. Habitat also runs
36 more successful stores in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, which contributed profits of Pounds
7.1m last year, and 17 troubled stores in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>, which incurred a loss of
Pounds 7.7m. In total, the Habitat group incurred losses of Pounds 8.8m on
sales of Pounds 201.2m.
<ORGANIZATION>Ikea</ORGANIZATION> is certainly not the only name in the frame as a potential acquirer and
'issues of substance' are still said to be under discussion. Au Printemps,
the French retail group, has also expressed interest in acquiring the
successful French arm, at least. Several other groups are also believed to
have come forward with proposals.
City analysts suggest, nevertheless, that <ORGANIZATION>Ikea</ORGANIZATION> is the likely prospective
victor, but they believe that any buyer would be most likely to acquire the
UK and French businesses as a package, leaving Storehouse to dispose of - or
close - the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> arm separately.
If <ORGANIZATION>Ikea</ORGANIZATION> were to complete the acquisition, it would command a strong position
at the upper end of the hugely fragmented UK furniture market, even though
its combined percentage share of the sector would still be in low single
figures.
Furniture retailers have been badly affected by recession, but <ORGANIZATION>Ikea</ORGANIZATION> has
proved resistant. After establishing a presence in <LOCATION>Warrington</LOCATION> in <DATE>1987</DATE>, it
has opened stores in <LOCATION>Wembley</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Birmingham</LOCATION> generating sales of Pounds 91.4m
last year. It plans to open stores at a rate of about one per year for the
forseeable future, with <LOCATION>Gateshead</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Croydon</LOCATION> being added to the list this
year.
Ikea seems likely to retain Habitat's distinctive style and name. <PERSON>Mr Kamprad</PERSON>
may provide the listless retailer with the purpose <PERSON>Storehouse</PERSON> has been
singularly unable to supply during the past few years.

FT  14 MAY 94 / How To Spend It: A child of the sixties celebrates a
birthday - Lucia van der Post on Habitat, 30 years old this week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In <DATE>1964</DATE>, when Habitat was born, I was a young mother in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, wheeling a
great high-sprung pram up and down the <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s Road from <LOCATION>World</LOCATION>'s End, where
we lived, to <PERSON>Peter Jones</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Sloane Square</LOCATION>, where I went in search of a carpet
or a lampshade or a chair that I liked and could afford. I was almost always
disappointed.
I had four floors of a terraced house to furnish and little money or
experience. Finding few things that I could bear to bring across the
threshold, I began to think I had very peculiar tastes. Certainly that was
how many shopkeepers of the day treated me, implying that anyone who stocked
the kind of things they imagined I wanted would soon be out of business.
My husband was completely nonplussed at how extraordinarily picky his young
wife had turned out to be. The trickiest scenes took place in the linoleum
department where the prevailing tastes of the day ran to bright renditions
of shells, stones or ancient Greek mosaics.
Then Habitat opened, on <DATE>May 11, 1964</DATE>. Oh, the relief. It was perfectly all
right not to like fringed velvet three-piece suites, to want no truck with
lampshades perched upon porcelain dolls, to prefer sturdy pale pine to
<ORGANIZATION>Formica</ORGANIZATION>, to find visual repose in a simple white Japanese paper lantern, to
prefer one's salad tossed in a hand-turned wooden bowl rather than a plastic
one.
It is almost impossible to convey to the post-Habitat generation just what
the birth of that first shop meant to the young marrieds of the <DATE>1960s</DATE>. The
clarity and simplicity of the vision was stunning.
Sir <PERSON>Terence Conran</PERSON>'s avowed mission was to prove that 'functional can be
beautiful, and beautiful must be affordable'. One design journalist was so
carried away she felt 'as if she had died and gone to heaven'. It was much
more than a shop - it offered the promise of a warmer, more sun-filled way
of life.
This week, <PERSON>Habitat</PERSON> was 30 years old and celebrated its birthday by offering
a small selection of goods stocked by the original shop at the original
prices - Japanese rush bugs at 18p, director's chairs at Pounds 5 each, six
<LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> glasses for 75p, bentwood chairs for Pounds 6.50.
All these things are marvellous illustrations of the longevity of what we
have come to call good design. The director's chair, the bentwood chair, the
paper lanterns, the plain linen, the rush or willow ware, the simple wooden
products - all have much the same timeless air as, say, an 18th century
piece of Wedgwood creamware, a piece of Shaker furniture, French bistro
pottery, 17th century English silverware. All of them should go on looking
good for years to come.
Tasteful, attractive, functional things, Habitat proved, did not have to
come with fancy price tags. We still have at home, doing sterling service,
some of the items we bought all those years ago - a couple of red
<PERSON>Magistretti</PERSON> rush-seated chairs, white painted bentwood chairs, a
black-stained ash desk top on trestles, storage units and countless
earthenware casseroles, white porcelain pots a la creme, white souffle
dishes. I am as pleased with them now as I was then.
If you look at Habitat today, it is good to see that <PERSON>Vittorio Radice</PERSON>, the
managing director, has kept to his avowed intention of taking Habitat back
to where it all began.
'Sir <PERSON>Terence Conran</PERSON>,' he told me a couple of years ago, 'had a wonderful
concept and as long as he kept to it the stores flourished. They were all in
beautiful buildings that were special to their towns. It was only when he
took his eye off the ball and they took Habitat into huge sheds in edge of
town sites that the merchandise deteriorated and the image became seriously
damaged.' The <DATE>1980s</DATE> Shabitat jokes began.
Look through a current catalogue - or better still, visit one of the stores
 -and you will see the original concept is alive and strong. The stores
today are light, bright airy places, just as I remember that first store in
the <LOCATION>Fulham Road</LOCATION>.
It has grown up a bit, in that the sofas look plumper, softer, more
welcoming. The textiles reflect our modern preoccupation with the earthy and
the natural. There is some lovely appliqued bed linen and plenty of the
attractive rushware that brought in the original customers - look for rattan
dining chairs, for storage chests, for tumbler covers, for picnic baskets
and a wonderful reclining chaise-longue for just Pounds 149.
There is, as always, a touch of the ethnic - galvanised iron baskets and
lanterns, an Edo paper lantern, a Dakari tray table from <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>. Having run
out of new cuisines to introduce us to (remember the tagine, the wok, the
pasta-maker?) kitchenware has reverted primarily to the simple and the
classic with the occasional exuberant burst of hand-painted Italian
ceramics.
In the Habitat of today you can find most of the basic ingredients a young
household needs. It has once again become a place that the design world
feels it needs to watch.
<PERSON>David Davies</PERSON>, the designer responsible for some of the most interesting
retailing projects around, firmly believes that today it is one of the best
home furnishing stores in the world. He says: 'I travel a lot and I do not
know of one to beat it for the mix of products, the incredible style and the
very affordable prices. The textiles, the cushions, the throws, the fabrics
are exceptionally well-priced and so is the furniture. Where else can you
buy a really good chair for Pounds 49? My office is full of them.'
The <DATE>1980s</DATE>' jokes are drying up.

<P>
I'm distressed that you published <PERSON>Mark A. Stein</PERSON>'s one-sided lament for loggers 
in Sweet Home, <LOCATION>Ore.</LOCATION>, who are supposedly losing work because environmentalists 
are trying to save the spotted owl. 
</P>
<P>
We in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> decry <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>'s and <LOCATION>Indonesia</LOCATION>'s felling of their tropical rain 
forests while we decimate our own old-growth forest at an equally reckless 
rate, contributing to the same global crises: release of carbon dioxide, 
exacerbating the greenhouse effect; and loss of habitat, reducing species 
diversity. 
</P>
<P>
The "jobs vs. environment" dichotomy is a red herring. Most timber unemployment 
has resulted from modernization of mill equipment. More jobs are lost because 
so many logs are now shipped, unprocessed, to <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>. (We harvest more wood than 
we need and sell <PERCENT>25%</PERCENT> to <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>. Yet the <ORGANIZATION>Forest Service</ORGANIZATION> proposes chopping <PERCENT>25%</PERCENT> 
more over the next decade!) 
</P>
<P>
A study by resource economist <PERSON>Jeffrey T. Olson</PERSON> shows that taking <PERCENT>25%</PERCENT> less wood 
would eliminate only 2,300 jobs in 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
Industry "research" to duplicate spotted owl habitat in the monoculture tree 
plantations with which it replaces nature's forests is absurd. What about all 
the other old growth-dependent species whose survival is threatened by 
ever-shrinking habitat -- grizzly bear, gray wolf, mountain lion, mountain 
goat, wolverine, lynx, fisher, flying squirrel, red tree vole, bog lemming, 
rough-skinned newt, Olympic salamander, tailed frog, goshawk, harlequin duck, 
marbled murrelet, pileated, red-cockaded and three-toed woodpecker, elegant 
trogon, red crossbill, olive-sided flycatcher?

<TEXT>
   Suburban <LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION> was no place to retire, so <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> and Tom
Powers packed up their belongings and moved.
   They didn't go to the Sun Belt.
   The Powers retired north, to <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Upper Peninsula</LOCATION>, a
flannel-shirted place even on <DATE>July</DATE> nights, famous for arduous
winters and mosquito-bit summers.
   ``Land of the Loon,'' the T-shirts say.
   The Powers could have flocked south like so much of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s
retiring public, but it was in these snowbirds' minds to head
instead toward <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>.
   ``I think <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> is pretty crowded and in my opinion, there are
not enough young people there,'' she said. ``All you do in <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>
is get behind some large car going 10 miles an hour.''
   Older Americans are a moving lot. The <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Bureau</ORGANIZATION> of the Census
calculates that <DATE>last year</DATE>, <PERCENT>5.3 percent</PERCENT> of those over 65 changed
homes, one out of five of them settling in another state.
   From <DATE>1975</DATE> to <DATE>1980</DATE>, more than <PERCENT>9 percent</PERCENT> of those over 60 moved out
of their home cities while another <PERCENT>13.4 percent</PERCENT> moved within their
towns, said <PERSON>Dr. Charles Longino</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>University of Miami</ORGANIZATION> researcher
who spent six years studying the migration.
   Warmer, dryer weather and lifestyle amenities like year-round
golf continue to draw most retirees south and west, said <PERSON>Don Fowles</PERSON>,
a statistician for the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Administration</ORGANIZATION> on Aging in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION> ``People are more sensitive to cold as they grow older.''
   A minority of the affluent elderly seek colder climates, as did
the Powers. <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION>, 67, and <PERSON>Tom</PERSON>, 68, found their haven on the tip
of the <LOCATION>Garden Peninsula</LOCATION>, a remote spit of land on the north shore of
<LOCATION>Lake Michigan</LOCATION>.
   There is only one paved road down the peninsula. The largest
town, <LOCATION>Garden</LOCATION>, has just a single grocery store and two bars. Most of
the residents are farmers, loggers or fishermen.
   ``After living in an area as congested as <LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION>, you need the
space the North provides,'' <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> said. ``I think most retirees
find it so blissful up here, with the clean air and the space.
   ``There's no fear, and it's such a relaxed feeling,'' she said.
``There's a friendlier attitude up here.''
   There also are economic reasons for flying north.
   The bottom dropped out of the <ORGANIZATION>Upper Peninsula</ORGANIZATION>'s economy five
years ago. Homes entered the market at rock bottom prices as iron
ore mines closed and workers moved away to find jobs.
   The economy has picked up since then, but housing remains a
bargain. A decent three-bedroom home in the <LOCATION>Upper Peninsula</LOCATION> goes for
<MONEY>$30,000</MONEY>, and <MONEY>$100,000</MONEY> will buy you a dream house on the shore, said
<LOCATION>Escanaba</LOCATION> real estate agent <PERSON>Jeanne Bonefeld</PERSON>. Her son in <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> tells
her the same homes sell for two to three times as much among the
orange groves.
   The ruggedness has its definite disadvantages. Tom broke his leg
recently when he was hit by a falling cedar tree. The closest
hospital was more than an hour away, although the local ambulance
arrived within 15 minutes.
   And when Tom needed arterial bypass surgery two years ago, the
Powers elected to use a hospital in <LOCATION>Green Bay</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wis</LOCATION>.
   Retirees living in the <LOCATION>North Woods</LOCATION> may find themselves isolated,
financially and geographically, from health care.
   A hearing in <LOCATION>Houghton Lake</LOCATION> held by <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Office of Services</ORGANIZATION>
to the Aging in <DATE>June</DATE> turned up tales of 20-mile ambulance rides to
the nearest hospital costing from <MONEY>$400</MONEY> to <MONEY>$1,000</MONEY> each. ``We need to
determine if they're paying actual costs or if they're being
bilked,'' said <PERSON>Mary Lindemann</PERSON>, with the state agency in <LOCATION>Lansing</LOCATION>.
   And then there is the snow.
   <ORGANIZATION>Delta County</ORGANIZATION> gets an average 56 inches of snowfall a winter _
more on the <LOCATION>Garden Peninsula</LOCATION> since it is surrounded by water _ so
the Powers own a snowblower and clear their 1,100-foot driveway
themselves.
   Their road is too narrow for a commercial plow. The Powers could
widen it, but that would ruin the remote atmosphere, <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> says.
   ``It takes the kind of person who likes the isolation. We enjoy
having the elbow room. We had lived cheek by jowl in town and we
were looking for someplace else,'' she said.
   The Powers have found a definite change of pace since their
working days _ he as a school administrator and she as a high school
English teacher _ outside of <LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION>.
   ``Chickadees eat out of our hands. I identified 42 different
kinds of wild flowers in my yard. I press flowers and make bookmarks
and make pine cone wreaths and I knit chair cushions and send them
off to my friends. You have time,'' <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> said.
   ``We never realized how beautiful a sunset was and we never
realized how far north the sun moves in the <DATE>summer</DATE>, how far south in
the winter.''

<PERSON>Mr. Keith</PERSON>, if you believe that through your double or triple dipping you are 
overpaid, you are probably right and have the privilege of refusing one of your 
pensions or returning it to the proper authorities. On the other hand, you have 
the right to use the surplus to help the homeless or any other unfortunates. 
</P>
<P>
However, I beg you to cease this effort to stop COLA increases since you 
obviously do not know what you are doing. 
</P>
<P>
I worked very hard to earn a government pension. I certainly earned much more 
than the <MONEY>$21,850</MONEY> salary you mention, and my pension is less than half that 
amount with COLAs. What's more, my Social Security pension is cut in proportion 
to the amount of government pension I receive with the result that my Social 
Security check is chicken feed. In fact, it would not support a chickadee. 
</P>
<P>
By combining my pensions with those of my husband, including COLAs, we are 
barely able to keep our heads above water and keep bread sans butter on the 
table. 
</P>
<P>
I have been retired only four years and already I have had to dip into savings 
for such things as car and home repairs. 
</P>
<P>
Without COLAs, we would lose all hope of surviving and soon join the homeless.

<TEXT>
   Some wilderness is fine, <PERSON>Hinson</PERSON> says, but you have to stop
somewhere, or at least guarantee some areas for development while
you're locking up others. <LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION>, he points out, already has 4
million acres of wilderness _ <PERCENT>7.6 percent</PERCENT> of the state.
   Others charge that environmentalists aren't as interested in
biological diversity as they are in creating elitist playgrounds for
wealthy, urban backpackers _ at the expense of local residents
trying to make a living off the public land.
   ``These lands belong to the people. That means all the people,
not a chosen few,'' says <PERSON>Butterfield</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Blue Ribbon Coalition</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>Lynne Stone</PERSON>, raised on an eastern <LOCATION>Oregon</LOCATION> ranch, says she's no
yuppie backpacker. And there are more ways to make a living off the
land, she adds, than by logging or mining it. Tourism is one of
<LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION>'s biggest industries, she says, and it's hard to lure tourists
to a clearcut.
   In 20 years, roads have been pushed through more than 8 million
acres of <LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION>'s wild country, according to the <ORGANIZATION>Idaho Conservation
League</ORGANIZATION>. ``We're destroying everything that isn't protected,'' Stone
says. ``If we don't set it aside, we'll lose it.''
   Both sides have strong arguments strongly stated _ if not
overstated. In virtually every wilderness debate, we're told the
area in question is a ``crown jewel'' of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s wildlands, to be
saved at all costs. We're also told, by the opposition, that locking
up the land in wilderness would deal the death blow to an already
ailing (pick one) logging, mining, or ranching industry.
   <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> is left to sort it out, and the politics of compromise
leave no one completely satisfied.
   ``It's amazing that this is going to be decided in some room in
the <LOCATION>Capitol</LOCATION>, 3,000 miles away,'' Stone says. ``It doesn't have
anything to do with <LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION> wilderness. It's who owes <PERSON>McClure</PERSON> a favor
at the time.''
   Whatever happens with <LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> faces enough other
wilderness issues to keep busy for another 25 years.
   It must decide whether 1.5 million acres of tundra in <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION>'s
<ORGANIZATION>Arctic National Wildlife Refuge</ORGANIZATION> is worth more for the caribou that
migrate over it or for the oil reservoirs that may lie under it.
   Battles also loom over vast <ORGANIZATION>Bureau of Land Management</ORGANIZATION> holdings in
the deserts of <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> and other Western states.
The <ORGANIZATION>BLM</ORGANIZATION> has inventoried about 25 million acres of potential
wilderness and is likely to recommend some fraction of that for
designation. The <ORGANIZATION>Wilderness Society</ORGANIZATION> says it will push for far more.
   Protecting entire ecosystems has become preservationists' latest
rallying cry. They hope to expand existing wilderness areas around
<ORGANIZATION>Yellowstone National Park</ORGANIZATION> and in the <LOCATION>Great Smoky Mountains of North
Carolina</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Tennessee</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Lynne Stone</PERSON>, meanwhile, focuses on her own wild <LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION> backyard.
When lobbying, she argues the dollars and cents of tourism. But her
real motives for saving wilderness prove more elusive, more personal.
   In an alpine meadow flushed purple with blooming lupines, Stone
gazes at a horizon of sawtoothed peaks and tries to explain her love
for the land. She talks vaguely of hiking with friends, of the world
she hopes her 11-year-old son will inherit.
   Finally, she settles on words borrowed from a friend who has
guided hunters and fishermen in the wild for years. ``He says they
don't really come for the hunting or fishing. They come for the hush
of the land.''
   A breeze rustles through the whitebark pines and sweeps across
the lupines. A far-off chickadee squeaks out a song. ``That's what
I'm trying to protect,'' Stone says. ``The hush of the land.''

FT  27 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Onerous disposal problem for Storehouse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STICHTING <ORGANIZATION>Ingka Foundation</ORGANIZATION>, Habitat's purchaser, may be a charitable
institution but it is certainly no slouch when it comes to tough talking.
Although the purchase price of Pounds 78m - including repayment of Pounds
24m of inter-company debt - was Pounds 7m above Habitat's net book value,
<ORGANIZATION>SIF</ORGANIZATION> succeeded in leaving Storehouse with some onerous responsibilities for
disposing of unwanted properties.
Storehouse is taking an extraordinary provision of Pounds 5m to cover the
cost of closing an unspecified number of Habitat stores should Habitat
subsequently decide it does not want to trade from them or chooses to
relocate elsewhere. This also includes some sites which have already ceased
trading.
<PERSON>Mr David Simons</PERSON>, finance director, said it might take up to two years to
dispose of these properties although he emphasised that the Pounds 5m
provision was a conservative estimate that reflected the maximum potential
liability.
Separately, <ORGANIZATION>Storehouse</ORGANIZATION> has also agreed to retain the freehold and leasehold
interests of several other properties which have a book value of Pounds 14m.
Storehouse will continue to receive rental income from the tenants until it
can dispose of these properties to institutional investors.
'One of the bits of baggage that Habitat has been carrying around has been
that quite a lot of the stores are in poor locations. We could not expect
<ORGANIZATION>Ikea</ORGANIZATION> to take them all on,' said <PERSON>Mr Simons</PERSON>.
Overall, the effect of disposing of Habitat and <PERSON>Richards</PERSON> will lead to a
reduction of Pounds 20m in shareholders funds but a Pounds 100m net cash
inflow.

FT  27 OCT 92 / Storehouse sells Habitat and Richards for Pounds 108m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STOREHOUSE, the retailing conglomerate created by Sir <PERSON>Terence Conran</PERSON> through
mergers in the <DATE>1980s</DATE>, was dismantled yesterday as the new management sold
two of its five trading companies, Habitat and <PERSON>Richards</PERSON>, for Pounds 108m.
The proceeds from the disposals - to <ORGANIZATION>Ikea</ORGANIZATION>'s holding company and <ORGANIZATION>Sears</ORGANIZATION>,
respectively - will be used to speed development of the core BhS and
<ORGANIZATION>Mothercare</ORGANIZATION> chains, which accounted for about three-quarters of last year's
group sales of Pounds 1.2bn. Blazer, the small men's-wear chain, has also
been earmarked for disposal.
<PERSON>Mr David Dworkin</PERSON>, chief executive since <DATE>July</DATE>, said: 'This is a dream come
true. It is an opportunity to focus on our two core businesses where there
is still great potential for expansion.'
Analysts welcomed the deal and suggested it might signal a new phase whereby
sprawling retail businesses slimmed down to concentrate on more narrowly
defined areas. Storehouse shares rose 3p to 164p.
The Habitat furniture chain, which runs 76 stores in the <ORGANIZATION>UK</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, will
be bought by the charitable <ORGANIZATION>Stichting Ingka Foundation</ORGANIZATION> (SIF), which owns the
<ORGANIZATION>Ikea Group</ORGANIZATION> of furniture stores, for Pounds 54m in cash plus the repayment of
Pounds 24m of inter-company loans. Storehouse said it was also in talks to
dispose of its <ORGANIZATION>Conran</ORGANIZATION>'s Habitat chain in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> but if these failed the
loss-making business would be shut.
Last year, Habitat in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> lost Pounds 1.1m on sales of Pounds 172m while
the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> business lost Pounds 7.7m.
<PERSON>Mr Ingvar Kamprad</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Ikea</ORGANIZATION>'s founder, said Habitat would be run as a 'totally
independent group' to secure the 'distinct Habitat identity'.
<ORGANIZATION>Sears</ORGANIZATION>, which has withdrawn from the men's wear market, is paying Pounds 30m
for the 213-store <PERSON>Richards</PERSON> women's wear chain, which made profits of Pounds
1m last year on sales of Pounds 98m.
<ORGANIZATION>Sears</ORGANIZATION>' already runs the <PERSON>Miss Selfridge</PERSON>, <PERSON>Wallis</PERSON> and Warehouse chains.
Storehouse, due to report its interim results next month, forecast it would
break even after pre-tax losses of Pounds 13.9m a year ago.
Substantial sales increases have been reported at BhS and <ORGANIZATION>Mothercare</ORGANIZATION> but the
group will suffer from an extraordinary charge of Pounds 30m resulting in a
reduction of net assets as a result of the disposals.

<LEADPARA>  IT'S easy to get hooked on this bird feeding business. You start out with a
handful of wild-bird seed and the next thing you know you're in the kitchen
cooking up Kush Kush Crumble for the little darlings.;   And the funniest
part, the experts say, is that the birds don't really need us. They manage
just fine, thank you, without our help.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Birds that find feeders full of seed or discover crumbs and fruit on a
feeding table will, naturally, come back for more. Still, a backyard feeder is
just one stop in a bird's search for food. Providing food doesn't make birds
totally dependent on human handouts.;   "Feeding birds is more of a benefit to
the people who are doing the feeding," says <PERSON>Ted Chandik</PERSON>, a naturalist and bird
specialist at <LOCATION>Palo Alto</LOCATION>'s Junior Museum.;   About 300 bird species are found
in the <LOCATION>Bay Area</LOCATION>; the ones most likely to appear in your yard with the least
encouragement are the house finch,; house sparrow, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> towhee, white
crowned sparrow, hummingbird,;   the jay and cedar waxwing. The scrub jays
especially like to pig out. Chandik says jays "eat everything and anything."; 
    Black sunflower seed, white proso millet, cracked corn and wheat will
attract nearly all species of seed-eating birds.;   When you put out a simple
hanging birdseed feeder -- either homemade or store-bought -- birds that like
to perch to get their food will stop by for a snack. Sparrows, finches,
towhees, cardinals, chickadees, titmice and nuthatches all get their food this
way.;   Here are other tips on bringing birds into your yard:;   (box)  FOOD
-- Seed and grains are still the birds' favorite food. You can mix your own,
buy packaged seed mixes or merely sit back and let the garden "go to seed."
Your neighbors might hate it, but the birds will love you.;   In their book
"Feed the Birds" (<PERSON>Workman</PERSON>, <MONEY>$8.95</MONEY>), <PERSON>Helen</PERSON> and <PERSON>Dick Witty</PERSON> warn that it's hard to
evaluate packaged wild-bird seed that is widely available at supermarkets, pet
stores and garden centers. "The best mixes," the Wittys write, "will cost more
and will contain more sunflower seed or sunflower meats than any other single
component. This is why you check the label.";   Buy about one month's supply
at a time because the seed and grains can deteriorate if kept longer.;   (box)
 SETTING -- The real estate mantra -- location, location, location -- applies
to bird feeders as well. A good spot for a hanging feeder is four to six feet
above ground level, either on a post or affixed to a tree.;   Birds like to
perch in nearby shrubbery to check out the location or wait in line -- it's
called the pecking order -- for a turn at the food. The natural plantings
should be at a distance of six to eight feet -- close by for cover, but still
far enough away from feeders to protect birds from hidden cats.;   Another
option is a low feeding table. An old picnic table is just about the right
dimensions, but build a small lip around the edge of the table to keep seed
from blowing away.;   The point is to provide several types of feeding
stations in various locations to attract the widest variety of birds.;   (box)
 WATER -- It's irresistible to birds. You can find beautifully made birdbaths
at garden centers, or you can turn over a trash-can lid, fill it with water
and make the birds perfectly happy. The important part is to keep the birdbath
fresh, clean and filled.;   (box)  PLANTINGS -- Birds like a natural
environment. Evergreens are particularly enticing because they offer shelter
and safety.;   But look no further than a cherry tree full of fruit to attract
every bird within five miles. They also like quince, red mulberry, flowering
crab apple and Russian olive for fruit and berries.;   They will also flock to
bayberry, yews, viburnums, dogwood, Tartarian honeysuckle, multiflora rose (or
any that produce small hips), cotoneaster and pyracanthas.;   <LOCATION>Pyracantha</LOCATION>,
incidentally, is the berry that turns cedar waxwings and robins into
falling-down drunks. In winter after being on the shrub awhile, pyracantha
berries begin fermenting and producing alcohol. Along come the cedar waxwings
and robins to binge on the berries. "They get very, very drunk," Chandik
says.;   (box)   CATS -- Prowling cats are a real danger to birds. Chandik, in
fact, says he stopped feeding birds in his own <LOCATION>East Palo Alto</LOCATION> yard because his
cat tormented the birds. "There's no foolproof way to protect the birds from
cats," he says.;   The <ORGANIZATION>National Audubon Society</ORGANIZATION> advises keeping cats indoors
in the morning and evening when birds are feeding. And, attach a bell to the
cat's collar to warn birds.; IFYOU'RE INTERESTED; The <ORGANIZATION>Santa Clara Valley

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
MR <PERSON>DAVID Dworkin</PERSON>, chief executive designate of <ORGANIZATION>Storehouse</ORGANIZATION>, has wasted little
time in making his influence felt at the retailing conglomerate, which
includes BhS, <ORGANIZATION>Mothercare</ORGANIZATION> and Habitat.
Yesterday, the company announced a reshuffling of its senior management
which will lead to the departure of <PERSON>Mr Michael Harvey</PERSON> as chairman and chief
executive of Habitat and the promotion of two BhS directors who worked
closely with <PERSON>Mr Dworkin</PERSON> in turning round the clothing and houseware company.
Ms <PERSON>Ann Iverson</PERSON>, BhS's American stores director, who previously worked with
<PERSON>Mr Dworkin</PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION>Bonwit Teller</ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> fashion chain, has been appointed chief
operating officer at <ORGANIZATION>Mothercare</ORGANIZATION>, the childrenswear chain which has failed to
exploit its strong market position.
<PERSON>Mr Steve Bedford</PERSON>, human resources director at BhS, will also assume the post
of group development director responsible for integrating managerial and
operational functions across <ORGANIZATION>Storehouse</ORGANIZATION>'s subsidiary companies.
Storehouse said the management at Habitat had been substantially reorganised
over the past few weeks with greater responsibility being devolved to three
operating companies.
Habitat's central management had been reduced - leading to the departure of
<PERSON>Mr Harvey</PERSON> - and the directors of the three operating companies will now
report to <PERSON>Mr David Simons</PERSON>, <PERSON>Storehouse</PERSON> finance director, who will take on
additional responsibilities as <ORGANIZATION>Habitat</ORGANIZATION>'s chairman.
<PERSON>Mr Harvey</PERSON> was on a three-year contract and will receive redundancy pay for
loss of office.
<PERSON>Mr Dworkin</PERSON> will succeed <PERSON>Mr Michael Julien</PERSON> as Storehouse chief executive in
<DATE>July</DATE>. See Lex

<LEADPARA>  THREE new homes for the poor aren't going to dent any community's housing
problems. But when they're built in Alviso by Habitat for Humanity, cheers are
in order and lessons abound.;    Last June, some 50 families were evicted from
their shacks at the southern end of San Francisco Bay when the landlord
decided his land could earn money another way. The evictions were legal, but
they were quick and crude.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Most of the 300 displaced people simply left the area. Others stayed in
shelters for the homeless. Eventually seven remaining families and the <ORGANIZATION>Bay &amp;

Habitat organizations across the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> have been recruiting skilled
volunteers, wangling land from cities and low-interest loans from lenders to
build thousands of homes. The families who move in almost always help build
the homes.;    Habitat's success in <LOCATION>Alviso</LOCATION> underscores the vitality and
commitment of non-profit developers. It also should shame a federal government
that continues its <DATE>1980s</DATE> retreat from low-cost housing.;    Yet there's much
that government, labor and business can do to help the non-profits help the
poor.;    Local and federal officials can streamline the red tape that can
slow or stymie non-profit projects. Tax credits for low-income housing, so
popular among investors because of their socially redeeming value, could be
increased to pre-1986 tax reform levels. Construction trade unions could lower
pay scales for non-profit developments. Suppliers could offer more discounts.
Employers could excuse more volunteers from their regular jobs.;    Meanwhile,
three <LOCATION>Alviso</LOCATION> families and Habitat for Housing have demonstrated to <LOCATION>Santa Clara
County</LOCATION> the potential and benefits of non-profit housing. And four more homes
are in the works.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>
   About 400 construction volunteers, led in a
rousing hymn by Mayor <PERSON>Andrew Young</PERSON>, began work <DATE>Monday</DATE> to build 20
homes in five days for working but poor families.
   The effort by the non-profit Habitat for Humanity, an ecumenical
Christian organization, is named the ``<PERSON>Jimmy Carter</PERSON> Work Project''
in honor of the former president, a former <ORGANIZATION>Habitat</ORGANIZATION> board member who
will join the workers for the final three days. It is the group's
largest project yet.
   Young, also a Congregationist minister, proclaimed it ``Habitat
for Humanity Week'' and led the crew in an impromptu rendition of
``When The Roll Is Called Up Yonder.''
   ``You bring with you the spirit and love of God, and a concern
for `the least of these' _ God's children,'' Young told the
workers. ``We are willing to combine our service and our cash in
the service of Christ.''
   The three-bedroom, one-bath houses being constructed in the
<LOCATION>Edgewood</LOCATION> neighborhood will be sold at no profit, with no interest,
to 20 working families with children. Mortgage payments will
average about <MONEY>$175</MONEY> a month, including taxes and insurance.
   The new neighborhood is being built on a block of land in
southeast <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> donated by the city. Supporting the 400-odd
construction workers are another 800 volunteers handling a variety
of chores.
   Plans call for 30 more houses to be built in the <LOCATION>Cabbagetown</LOCATION>
neighborhood by <DATE>1989</DATE> and 25 more homes by <DATE>1990</DATE> in another
neighborhood. Habitat for <ORGANIZATION>Humanity</ORGANIZATION> is working to raise <MONEY>$1.5 million</MONEY>
for the first 50 homes in the <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> project.
   Young recalled that he and his wife, <PERSON>Jean</PERSON>, were able to buy a
home of their own years ago, when he worked on a small salary at
the <ORGANIZATION>Southern Christian Leadership Conference</ORGANIZATION> and she earned even
less as a teacher.
   ``Now ... it's almost impossible to afford the home, the
financing and the interest,'' he said, adding that ``never before
in the history of this country have we had such a crisis in
housing.''
   But through Habitat for Humanity, ``we can have homes with no
profit, and no interest,'' <PERSON>Young</PERSON> said.
   The effort is ``real rewarding work,'' said project director
<PERSON>Bruce Gunter</PERSON>, an <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> investments counselor and veteran Habitat
volunteer. ``This is such a motivational bunch of folks.''
   About one-third of this week's workers are in the construction
business themselves, <PERSON>Gunter</PERSON> said. ``Another third are moderately
skilled, and the other third don't know one end of the hammer from
the other.
   ``But there's work for everybody; you need some people to tote
things, too,'' he said.
   Also on <DATE>Monday</DATE>, Habitat for Humanity supporters began a
1,200-mile walk from <LOCATION>Portland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION>, to <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION>. Along the way,
they plan to build 120 homes for needy families.
   <DATE>Sunday</DATE> in <LOCATION>Macon</LOCATION>, about 200 people walked a mile in 100-degree
heat to the first house built by Habitat in that central <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION>
city.
   Habitat for Humanity was founded in <DATE>1976</DATE> by <PERSON>Millard Fuller</PERSON>, a
millionaire businessman who, in the late <DATE>1960s</DATE>, gave away his
fortune and began working to house the poor.
   <PERSON>Carter</PERSON> served on Habitat's board from <DATE>1984-87</DATE> and continues to
work with the organization.

FT  22 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Second half boost for Storehouse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN FOOTBALL parlance, it was a game of two halves at <LOCATION>Storehouse</LOCATION> <DATE>last year</DATE>.
After a pretty dismal first six months in which it lost Pounds 13.9m, the
retailing group, which includes BhS, <ORGANIZATION>Mothercare</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Habitat</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Richards</PERSON> and
Blazer, recorded a strong improvement in the second half with trading
profits for the period bouncing to Pounds 27.3m compared with Pounds 13.2m
the year before. Over the same period sales grew from Pounds 572m to Pounds
606.4m.
At the heart of <ORGANIZATION>Storehouse</ORGANIZATION>'s turnround was a strong recovery from BhS, the
clothing and homeware group, which has undergone something of a
metamorphosis under the direction of its chief executive, <PERSON>Mr David Dworkin</PERSON> -
who it was announced yesterday would replace <PERSON>Mr Michael Julien</PERSON> as group
chief executive.
BhS contributed Pounds 22.1m (Pounds 21.6m) to full year trading profits and
Pounds 634.7m (Pounds 617.7m) to sales. But <PERSON>Mr Dworkin</PERSON> believes there are
further significant benefits to be reaped from BhS. 'My own view is that the
month we are in is the best we have ever had. Last year we had our 'May
mania' when everything that was not tied down was on sale. But even so we
are beating the living hell out of those numbers this year,' he said.
However, it was not the same story across the group. Although <PERSON>Storehouse</PERSON>
said the sales trend had improved since <DATE>Christmas</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>Mothercare</ORGANIZATION>
childrenswear business experienced a sharp fall into a Pounds 3.9m loss for
the year reversing a previous profit of Pounds 6.8m. This decline was blamed
on increased costs and intensified competition. Sales were slightly down at
Pounds 233.8m (Pounds 234.8m).
Habitat, the furniture group, also had a tough year recording losses of
Pounds 8.8m against Pounds 11.9m. Its French arm made a strong contribution,
but the UK was weak and <PERSON>Conran</PERSON>'s Habitat in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> lost Pounds 7.7m although
remedial action was promised this year. Habitat's sales also fell marginally
to Pounds 201.2m (Pounds 205.9m).
The <PERSON>Richards</PERSON> womenswear chain recorded a small increase in operating profits
but <ORGANIZATION>Blazer</ORGANIZATION> made a small loss. Together, they accounted for Pounds 600,000
(Pounds 1.7m) of profits and Pounds 110.1m (Pounds 103.2m) of sales.
Staff numbers were cut by about 500 to 14,260 during the year.
Storehouse devoted Pounds 45m to capital expenditure but is stepping up its
investment programme this year to more than Pounds 60m.

JACK SMITH ON SUNDAY: PECKING ORDERS BIRDERS AND TWITCHERS: EQUALLY AVID AVIAN 
WATCHERS -- BUT WITH DIFFERENT TECHNIQUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By JACK SMITH

<TEXT>
<P>
AMERICANS AND the British are not only separated by a common language but they 
also seem not to understand one another's sports. Though Americans are 
beginning to watch soccer, it is not the sport of enormous popularity in 
<LOCATION>America</LOCATION> that it is in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>, and cricket is quite incomprehensible to 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
It seems to me that the one sport that might bring us together is birding. I am 
awed by the dedication and vigor our British cousins bring to that gentle 
sport. Recently, thanks to a clipping from the Guardian sent to me by <PERSON>Jim</PERSON> and 
<PERSON>Suzan Moore</PERSON>, now residents of <LOCATION>Cambridge</LOCATION>, I told how a mob of 2,000 twitchers 
tramped through a <LOCATION>Norfolk</LOCATION> woods for a glimpse of a rare red-breasted nuthatch 
reported in that neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
A twitcher is a birder who is interested only in adding another bird to his 
life list and will go to any lengths, using any kind of conveyance, to 
accomplish those ends. Ordinary birders -- who seek mainly the fresh air, 
exercise and communion with nature that their sport affords -- do not 
especially like twitchers. 
</P>
<P>
More recently, however, <PERSON>Alice Everett McCloskey</PERSON> sent me a clipping from the 
<PERSON>Dickinson</PERSON> (N. D.) Press that reported on the <ORGANIZATION>National Audubon Society</ORGANIZATION>'s 
Christmas bird count in and around <LOCATION>Medora</LOCATION>. Although the windchill factor was 30 
degrees below zero, 15 hardy <LOCATION>Dakotans</LOCATION> showed up for the count. The sky was 
overcast, and the sun did not shine as they fanned out from <ORGANIZATION>Theodore Roosevelt 
National Park Visitor</ORGANIZATION>'s Center at <TIME>7:30 a.m.</TIME> 
</P>
<P>
One group consisted of two men and their sons, ages 10 and 6. As the Press put 
it, "the four-man crew was armed with binoculars, bird books and had their eyes 
peeled for fluttering wings." They soon sighted a rooster ringneck pheasant and 
heard a chickadee. 
</P>
<P>
Altogether, that group sighted 10 species, including a golden eagle, 
sharp-tailed grouse, black-tailed magpies and robins. Evidently, though, the 
cold kept many birds in their hiding places, but the birders also saw species 
of wildlife other than birds, including deer, a herd of antelope, a porcupine, 
a coyote and many cottontails. Meanwhile, the sun remained hidden, and the 
birders were assaulted by continuous snow flurries. 
</P>
<P>
Surely, birders as hardy as those <LOCATION>Dakotans</LOCATION> could identify with British birders 
and twitchers. The weather in the <LOCATION>British Isles</LOCATION> is not that much better than it 
is in <LOCATION>North Dakota</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, the <PERSON>Moores</PERSON> sent me another clipping from the Guardian, updating the 
birding scene in <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>. It notes that twitchers, the more aggressive of the 
two kinds of birders, spend much time telephoning Birdline, a British service 
that reports on rare sightings. No matter how distant the sighting may be, the 
true twitcher makes a beeline for the location by whatever transportation is at 
hand. Some twitchers have gone to extraordinary lengths to add one bird to 
their list. 
</P>
<P>
One birder who owns a private jet keeps it fueled up so he can speed on an 
instant's notice to a distant sighting. In <DATE>1988</DATE>, four Cambrian lads drove 500 
miles in 14 hours, sighting 138 birds along the way. 
</P>
<P>
Inevitably, such exertions sometimes come a cropper. Last year, a group of 
twitchers were hiding in a reed bed near <LOCATION>Portsmouth</LOCATION>, hoping to sight a rare 
red-breasted pochard. Alas, it took off and flew into a passing car, "reducing 
itself to a pathetic bunch of feathers." 
</P>
<P>
Twitchers sometimes get out of hand. Recently one was jailed for throwing rocks 
into a bush to disturb his quarry. But twitchers are said to be trying to 
discourage this kind of misconduct among their own. 
</P>
<P>
Twitchers are often frustrated. Those 2,000 who tramped through the <LOCATION>Norfolk</LOCATION> 
woods in search of the red-breasted nuthatch heard later that the bird had been 
seen miles away by a woman walking her dog. 
</P>
<P>
A boat full of twitchers was heading toward the <LOCATION>Isles</LOCATION> of <LOCATION>Scilly</LOCATION> when a storm 
blew up. The boat heaved about for 15 hours, unable to make harbor, and the 
seasick twitchers returned empty-handed to Penzance. 
</P>
<P>
The Guardian repeats the well-known story of an American bird that accidentally 
landed in the Scillies some years ago. As hundreds of twitchers trained their 
'scopes, snapped pictures and scribbled notes, a cat crept up and carried off 
their quarry. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Richard Millington</PERSON>, a founder of Birdline, acknowledges his addiction to 
twitching. "I admit it's an obsession. I suppose I have missed out on many 
other things, but I can't imagine what life would be like without twitching." 
</P>
<P>
It seems to me that Anglo-American relations would be improved if a number of 
British birders and twitchers were to come to <LOCATION>North Dakota</LOCATION> for the annual 
Christmas count. They could probably add some unusual birds to their lists, and 
at least they might see a porcupine. 
</P>
<P>
They'd best wear their ear muffs, though.

GROUP'S INTERNAL SQUABBLE IRKS HIM  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     <PERSON>Carter</PERSON> has hinted that he may quit in the wake of <DATE>Monday</DATE>'s announcement by
<PERSON>Millard Fuller</PERSON>, founder of Habitat for Humanity, that the organization's board
of directors pushed him to resign as president.;    <PERSON>Carter</PERSON> has been Habitat's
leader for fund-raising and its most recognizable carpenter since <DATE>1984</DATE>,
ensuring a wave of publicity for the group any time he picked up a hammer.;   
Fuller said <DATE>early today</DATE> he doesn't believe <PERSON>Carter</PERSON> will stay unless the board
rehires him.;    "Recent decisions by the board of directors of Habitat to
force the resignation of <PERSON>Millard Fuller</PERSON> as president have been quite
disturbing to us," <PERSON>Carter</PERSON> said in a statement on behalf of himself and his
wife, <LOCATION>Rosalynn.</LOCATION>;    "Our prayers are that the board of directors will be able
to resolve the arguments," he added. "Our own personal roles in the future
will be more specifically defined by these decisions.";    <PERSON>Carter</PERSON> declined to
elaborate on the statement.;    Habitat's board chairman, lawyer <PERSON>Geoff Van
Loucks</PERSON> of <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION>, said the group is negotiating with Fuller to find a role
for him within the organization but without administrative responsibilities.; 
  <PERSON>Fuller</PERSON> said in a phone interview from <LOCATION>Americus</LOCATION> <DATE>today</DATE> that the board members
asked for his resignation during a meeting in <LOCATION>Portland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ore.</LOCATION>, on Saturday.;   
He said the controversy was prompted when he and <PERSON>Jeff Snider</PERSON>, Habitat's chief
executive officer, tried to fire a senior staff person from <LOCATION>Habitat</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Americus</LOCATION>
headquarters.;    He declined to identify the staffer but said the board
upheld the firing.;    <PERSON>Van Loucks</PERSON> said the board's problems with <ORGANIZATION>Fuller</ORGANIZATION>
involved his trying to run the organization while keeping up a busy travel
schedule.;    The group has more than 560 affiliates in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and
more than 100 projects in 30 foreign countries. It was honored <DATE>Monday</DATE> by
<ORGANIZATION>Housing and Urban Development</ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON>Jack Kemp</PERSON> for the building of its

<TEXT>  Miss M's co-stars have ranged from <PERSON>Nick Nolte</PERSON> to <PERSON>Woody Allen</PERSON>, but she has yet
to achieve the teaming that she dreamed up for Vanity Fair. "I wanted so much
to do a movie with Pee-wee Herman. . . . I wanted to do a 'My Little
Chickadee' type of thing in which he falls in love with me in an innocent way,
and I kind of use him in a nefarious way. Personally, I happen to like
Pee-wee. He's such a sweet guy. . . . I don't know what the hell he was doing
in that theater. I swear to God! But what's the big deal? That's what those
theaters are for. . . . How can you be so hypocritical as to have one in your
community and then pretend you don't know what's going on in them? . . . I saw
something on <PERSON>Joan Rivers</PERSON> that so stunned me I didn't even know what country I
was in. She had a sex therapist on, which was an excuse to talk about
masturbation. How to do it, when to do it. This was daytime TV! It was so low!
. . . And yet they'll put that on television and then crucify Pee-wee <PERSON>Herman</PERSON>
for going into a theater that they have provided for him to go into. This is
my new favorite expression: What a world! What a world!"; <PERSON>JAMES CAAN</PERSON>; (box)
Double-crossed by the Duke; <PERSON>Midler</PERSON>'s "For the Boys" co-star made a big
comeback with "Misery" last year, getting back on track with a Hollywood
career that started in the '60s, when he made <ORGANIZATION>Howard Hawks</ORGANIZATION>' "El Dorado" with
<PERSON>John Wayne</PERSON>. The up-and-coming actor hit it off with the aging superstar, <PERSON>Caan</PERSON>
recalled in Premiere: "I got on pretty well with him. I was about half a stunt
man, all my friends were stunt men, and he liked that kinda stuff. He was . .
. like a 12-year-old kid. One time, I came back to my trailer, and he'd filled
it full of garbage cans. He made me play chess with him, and I beat him the
first time. Last time that happened. He'd cheat. I'd get these phone calls,
you know, and I'd come back and go, 'Hey, that rook wasn't over there.'
'Whaddaya mean, kid? That was right there.' "; <PERSON>JANINE TURNER</PERSON>; (box) Can looks
kill a career?; Before "Northern Exposure," her first exposure was as the
youngest model, at age 15, ever signed by <ORGANIZATION>Wilhelmina Agency</ORGANIZATION>. From there she
moved into acting, with her first big part on the soap "General Hospital." She
was also engaged for a while to another former soap star, <PERSON>Alec Baldwin</PERSON>: "He
was just off 'The Doctors' and I'd just left '<ORGANIZATION>General Hospital</ORGANIZATION>,' " she told
<ORGANIZATION>Redbook</ORGANIZATION>. "His career was taking off and I was struggling, showing up at
bathing-suit auditions where they'd literally ask me to do a 360-degree turn.
I watched him get jobs that were very credible and respectable, and I was
supposed to be the bimbo running down the beach in a bikini. Alec's gorgeous,
but he's a man -- his looks don't detract from his integrity as an actor. I
think, as a woman, you get pigeonholed."; <PERSON>ROBERT MITCHUM</PERSON>; (box) A stickler for
the truth; He has a cameo role in the remake of a film in which he starred,
"Cape Fear." But over his career, he told <ORGANIZATION>Interview</ORGANIZATION>, there were a lot of big
films that he turned down: "I don't believe in conditions being falsified in
order to make a script work. Take 'In the Heat of the <ORGANIZATION>Night</ORGANIZATION>.' Opening scene,
the guy is being thrown out of a saloon in <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION>. But there were no
saloons in <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION>. Another one, 'The Defiant Ones' -- you had a black man
and a white man chained together on a <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> chain gang, but it was against
the law. I was on a chain gang in <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION>. I know what it's like. I was only
15 years old. I figured, it ain't gonna last forever. I didn't think it was
going to be my course in life. What the hell, I met a lot of interesting
people. People who'd teach you how to burgle."  </TEXT>

FT  17 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Storehouse sells US arm - Former
Bloomingdale chief buys Conran's Habitat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ALMOST A YEAR to the day after retiring as chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Bloomingdale's</ORGANIZATION>, the
up-market North American department store chain, <PERSON>Mr Marvin Traub</PERSON> is to buy
<ORGANIZATION>Conran</ORGANIZATION>'s Habitat in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>, founded by one of the <ORGANIZATION>UK</ORGANIZATION>'s fallen retail stars.
Storehouse, the retail group which owns <ORGANIZATION>Conran</ORGANIZATION>'s Habitat through The <ORGANIZATION>Conran
Stores Inc</ORGANIZATION>, will receive a nominal price from MTLG, a vehicle owned partly
by <PERSON>Mr Traub</PERSON>.
The <PERSON>Traub</PERSON> consortium said yesterday that it would keep the <PERSON>Conran</PERSON> name, but
planned to remerchandise the stores, possibly bringing in international
designers and reinstating the catalogue operation. 'We need to improve the
productivity of the space,' said <PERSON>Mr Traub</PERSON>, pointing out that 500,000 square
feet of retail space last year generated just Dollars 51m in sales.
When in <DATE>October</DATE> Storehouse announced its break-up it said closure or sale of
<ORGANIZATION>Conran Stores</ORGANIZATION> would lead to a Pounds 25m extraordinary provision. Last year
<ORGANIZATION>Conran Stores</ORGANIZATION> made a Pounds 7.7m loss, although <PERSON>Mr Traub</PERSON> said they had been
profitable in the late-1980s.
The sale substantially completes the dismantling of the retailing
conglomerate built up by Sir <PERSON>Terence Conran</PERSON> in the <DATE>1980s</DATE>. In <DATE>October</DATE>,
<ORGANIZATION>Storehouse</ORGANIZATION> sold Habitat to the holding company of <ORGANIZATION>Ikea</ORGANIZATION>, the Swedish
retailer, while <ORGANIZATION>Sears</ORGANIZATION> bought the <PERSON>Richards</PERSON> fashion chain.
Storehouse expects to have no net debt by the year-end. The Pounds 108m
proceeds of the Habitat and <PERSON>Richards</PERSON> sales will be used to develop the
remaining BhS and <ORGANIZATION>Mothercare</ORGANIZATION> chains.
The 19 Habitat stores in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> are based mainly on the <LOCATION>East Coast</LOCATION> with an
image which is already slightly upmarket of their namesake stores in the UK.
<PERSON>Mr Traub</PERSON>, a New Yorker and <ORGANIZATION>Harvard Business School</ORGANIZATION> graduate, started his
retail career as a Macy's trainee, and then spent a year at <ORGANIZATION>Alexander</ORGANIZATION>'s, the
now-defunct New York-based retail group.
He moved to <ORGANIZATION>Bloomingdale</ORGANIZATION>'s, where, after a succession of merchandising
posts, he became president in <DATE>1969</DATE>. He later became a director of <ORGANIZATION>Federated
Department Stores</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Bloomingdale</ORGANIZATION>'s parent, which was taken over by <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>'s
<ORGANIZATION>Campeau</ORGANIZATION>, via a highly-leveraged deal, in the <DATE>1980s</DATE>.
<ORGANIZATION>Campeau</ORGANIZATION> put <ORGANIZATION>Bloomingdale</ORGANIZATION>'s up for sale in <DATE>1989</DATE>, but <PERSON>Mr Traub</PERSON>'s efforts to
buy the chain were unsuccessful. Bankruptcy for <ORGANIZATION>Campeau</ORGANIZATION> and its various
retail operations followed, although a relatively speedy reorganisation
allowed <PERSON>Federated</PERSON>, still incorporating the <ORGANIZATION>Bloomingdale</ORGANIZATION>'s stores, to move
out of Chapter 11 proceedings earlier this year.
Since leaving <ORGANIZATION>Bloomingdale's</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Mr Traub</PERSON> has formed his own firm, <ORGANIZATION>Marvin Traub
Associates</ORGANIZATION>, a retail consultancy business. He has been joined by <PERSON>Mr Lester
Gribetz</PERSON>, as executive vice-president.

<HL> LEISURE &amp; ARTS: Even as It Burns, Yellowstone Is Reborn </HL>
<AUTHOR> Ruth Rudner </AUTHOR>
<SO> </SO>
<DATELINE> Yellowstone National Park, Wyo.  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   We tied the horses in the shade and sat down at the edge of a meadow on <ORGANIZATION>Shallow Creek</ORGANIZATION>. 
Smoke spread along the tree-covered ridge bounding the meadow's far side. 
It appeared in isolated pockets lower down, rising softly, like morning wisps of mist over a stream. 
Suddenly flames shot up from the top of the ridge: towering orange spears of fire mimicking the shape of trees, but magnified and ugly, laced with black spumes, shrouded in thick, yellowish smoke. 
There was nothing gentle about it. 

   Yellowstone is on fire. 
Unprecedented winds and dryness have combined to fuel the fires to proportions no one could have predicted. 
"In 118 years there has never been a <DATE>summer</DATE> without rain," <PERSON>John Varley</PERSON>, the park's chief of research, told me. 

   In spite of its all-out fight, the park can manage only the direction of the fires' flanks, attacking wherever towns and other developed sites are threatened. 
It is humanly impossible to put them out. 
Even if firefighters had gotten an earlier start on extinguishing the fires, they wouldn't have had much luck. (Such attempts elsewhere in the region this <DATE>summer</DATE> have been unsuccessful.) 
Suppression will come when it finally rains or snows. 
Then, one act of nature will deal with another. 
Even now, the prime burning period is steadily shortening as the days shorten. 

   Residents of gateway towns, angered at the fires' proximity, forget, when faced with nature's power, that they have chosen to live on the edge of wildness. 
Most of these people depend on tourists for a livelihood. 
They are understandably frightened the fire will rob them of all they have. 

   While these people worry about their homes and their livelihoods, others see the fires as destructive to the earth. 
But this is too short a view of nature. 
For forests, fires bring rebirth and renewal. 

   Speaking as an ecologist, <PERSON>Mr. Varley</PERSON> says, "It's the end of one life cycle, but it's the beginning of another." 

   In <LOCATION>Yellowstone</LOCATION>, at the edge of fire, I felt present at the beginning. 
I was in the park for a five-day horsepacking trip sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION>Yellowstone Institute</ORGANIZATION>, the nonprofit adjunct to the park's interpretive programs, which, ironically, had a fire ecology class on this <DATE>summer</DATE>'s roster that was canceled (before the fires started) for lack of interest. 
The horse trip was led by outfitter and botanist <PERSON>Dick Clark</PERSON>, who had a double mission in this annual course: to honor the <LOCATION>Nez Perce</LOCATION> by retracing the route of their <DATE>1877</DATE> flight from the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Army</ORGANIZATION>, and to teach low-impact horsepacking. 

   Because a portion of our planned route went through the Clover-Mist fire, it had to be changed. 
Revised, it was also more historically appropriate, according to <ORGANIZATION>Yellowstone</ORGANIZATION> historian <PERSON>Aubrey Haines</PERSON>. 
It took us up the <LOCATION>Pelican Valley</LOCATION>, through prime grizzly habitat, toward the Mirror Plateau, where the <LOCATION>Nez Perce</LOCATION> were known to have camped. 

   We crossed into the broad Shallow Creek drainage, west of the <LOCATION>Pelican Valley</LOCATION>, to camp near <PERSON>Fern Lake</PERSON>. 
There was smoke in the northeast, coming from the Clover-Mist fire, the largest in the park, the one now close to the towns of <ORGANIZATION>Cooke City</ORGANIZATION> and Silver Gate. 
The air smelled of smoke. 

   At certain times the air everywhere in the region smells of smoke, even in <LOCATION>Bozeman</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mont.</LOCATION>, 90 miles north of the park, where I live. 
Sometimes, waves of smoke come billowing down a valley. 
Sometimes smoke lingers over the ridge-tops, as if the sky were covered by gray and acrid clouds, yet you turn around and the sky is deepest blue. 

   Shallow Creek runs out of <ORGANIZATION>Wapiti Lake</ORGANIZATION> just to its south. 
The lake was to have been our second campsite, but with the fire coming down the ridge, we moved back down to <LOCATION>Broad Creek</LOCATION>, about three miles from our original campsite. 
As we approached, a coyote ambled along the creek. 
Earlier, we had glimpsed elk bedded down in a far meadow and a bear at the edge of forest who rose up on two legs to see us better. 
A <ORGANIZATION>Swainson</ORGANIZATION>'s hawk soared overhead. 
Evenings and mornings, <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> geese flew over, honking. 

   "Shouldn't we see animals running from the fire?" someone asked. 
But that's not what animals do. 
"Bambi," it turns out, really was a fairy tale. 
While some of <ORGANIZATION>Yellowstone</ORGANIZATION>'s elk have left burning areas, none were running, and many are simply bedding down a hundred yards or so from the flames. 
Bears, too, just move aside. 
<PERSON>Mr. Varley</PERSON> told me he has never "talked to a firefighter who has seen a large, dead animal." 
Elk have been seen going into still smoldering blackened areas to lick the mineral ash. 
Some biologists speculate that the elk like those areas because the bugs, normally a horror for them at this time of year, have gone up in smoke. 
And in the wetter areas, where new growth begins sprouting almost as soon as the fire is out, elk find a fresh source of food. 

   Most of the smaller animals are burrowers who simply go underground until the fire passes. 
The reproductive parts of many plants are also safely underground, ready to grow when the fire stops. 
Lodgepole pine actually requires fire to burst open and release the seed from one of its two kinds of cones. 
After a fire, the nutrient-rich earth sprouts with a speed the shade of its former vegetation never would have allowed. 

   Until we sat at <ORGANIZATION>Shallow Creek</ORGANIZATION> watching the flames, the fire had not affected us. 
Now it entered our lives. 
For some in the group it seemed too close. 
Yet the fire's pattern is to flare up in the afternoons, and we had seen it at the height of its activity. 
It was unlikely to reach us in the time of our stay. 
The animals weren't running. 
I didn't want to either. 

   Though this <DATE>summer</DATE>'s conflagrations are on a large scale, earlier fires in the same type of habitat can offer indications of what will happen this time around. 
As it turns out, the habitat in the area of the Clover-Mist fire, with some of the park's most productive soil, is new. 
Ecologists, excited about what will happen here, anticipate an extraordinary diversity of plant life, insects, mammals and, especially, birds. 

   Fire plays a big role in the life of birds. 
Some, like goshawks, requiring old-growth forest, will take off for them, but more species will appear than leave. (Figures from past fires show about 12 species leaving, 18 appearing.) 
The century of fire suppression preceding current policy encouraged the decline of certain birds throughout the <ORGANIZATION>Rockies</ORGANIZATION>. 
For mountain bluebirds, black-backed and three-toed woodpeckers and wood phoebes, whose populations should boom in the next 10 to 20 years, fire literally is the chance of a lifetime. 
Even fish stand to benefit from the fire as nutrient-rich leafy vegetation grows up along streams and then falls in. 

   What is natural in the park is not threatened by fire. 
Normally, as was true this year, the fire season doesn't even start until baby birds have fledged and the other young of the year can get out of its way. 
Thermal features such as geysers won't burn up. 
The new growth on previously burned areas is fire-resistant. 

   We rode back to <ORGANIZATION>Shallow Creek</ORGANIZATION> the next morning, hoping to get beyond it to Mirror Lake and the Mirror Plateau. 
There was little fire activity on the ridge, beyond a few puffs of smoke. 
An occasional puff issued from the slope. 
By the time we reached a small, unnamed lake about three miles from <ORGANIZATION>Mirror Lake</ORGANIZATION>, the smoke was thicker. 
Fire blocked our way to the plateau. 

   That evening a helicopter landed in our meadow. 
Lake District <PERSON>Ranger John Lounsbury</PERSON> wanted to get word to our leader, <PERSON>Dick Clark</PERSON>, that fire was moving toward <ORGANIZATION>Wapiti Lake</ORGANIZATION> and that a new lightning strike was burning near <PERSON>Fern Lake</PERSON>, closing the trail we had taken in. 
We had one way out now, but it was the route we had planned, so we weren't inconvenienced. 
It did bring home to us that fire can cancel options. 
In the short run. 
In the long run, earth, animals and, therefore, people benefit from the renewed, vigorous and robust life the fire bears. 
It is an awesome event, this new earth being prepared for a life that comes almost at once, phoenix, rising from its own ashes.

<TEXT>
   Fear for the survival of 180 endangered
squirrels atop an isolated mountain led a judge to block the start
of construction on what could become the world's most powerful
observatory.
   <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> District <PERSON>Judge Alfredo C. Marquez</PERSON> on <DATE>Monday</DATE> granted a
four-month injunction barring the <ORGANIZATION>University of Arizona</ORGANIZATION> from
beginning construction on the first two of at least three
telescopes at the planned <MONEY>$200 million</MONEY> <ORGANIZATION>Mount Graham International
Observatory</ORGANIZATION>.
   If all goes smoothly with the first two telescopes, a third
device that would have the viewing power o a telescope more than 37
feet in diameter is planned for the mid-1990s.
   The judge said serious questions had been raised over whether
the construction would cause irreparable harm to the Mount <PERSON>Graham</PERSON>
red squirrel.
   ``I'm surprised. I'm encouraged,'' said <PERSON>Dr. Robin Silver</PERSON>, a
spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION>Maricopa County Audubon Society</ORGANIZATION>. ``This has been
a tough process all along. I'm encouraged that the system can still
work.''
   The university has decided to appeal, spokesman <PERSON>Steve Emerine</PERSON>
said <DATE>today</DATE>.
   Mount <PERSON>Graham</PERSON> in the <LOCATION>Pinaleno Mountains</LOCATION> in southeastern <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>
is the only known habitat for the 180 remaining squirrels.
   In <DATE>1988</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Fish</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Wildlife Service</ORGANIZATION> concluded in a
biological report for the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Forest Service</ORGANIZATION>, the site's landlord,
that the telescopes could coexist with the squirrel. <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>'s
congressional delegation then pushed through legislation ordering
the <ORGANIZATION>Forest Service</ORGANIZATION> to grant the university a permit for
construction.
   But environmental groups sued, contending that perching the
telescopes on an 8.6-acre site on one of <LOCATION>Mount Graham</LOCATION>'s three peaks
would assure the extinction of the 8-ounce squirrels by taking away
more of the forested land they need to survive.
   University officials contend poor pine cone crops in recent
years have hurt the squirrel population. They said hunting,
logging, use of off-road vehicles and Christmas tree-cutting have
been stopped because of the planned observatory, and that 60 to 80
acres will be reforested.
   In closing arguments, lawyers for the university and the <ORGANIZATION>Justice
Department</ORGANIZATION> said that the congressional act precluded any further
environmental review of the squirrel's habitat in connection with
the first three telescopes.
   But <PERSON>Marquez</PERSON> said <DATE>Monday</DATE> he had some questions about whether the
wildlife service's ruling was ``preordained.''
   He asked <ORGANIZATION>Justice Department</ORGANIZATION> lawyer <PERSON>Larry Bradfish</PERSON>, ``What's the
harm of saying there are some very serious issues here and
<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>, you have 120 days ... why don't you take another look at
it?''
   University officials said they were disappointed by the ruling.
   <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON>Jim Kolbe</PERSON>, <LOCATION>R-Ariz.</LOCATION>, said he did not think <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>
would take new action.
   ``There would have to be a major change in the status of the
squirrel or an alteration of the biological facts. Absent that, I
can't see any reason for <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> to act,'' <PERSON>Kolbe</PERSON> said.
   Two biologists who took part in the wildlife service study
alleged in depositions that officials at the agency ordered
researchers to argue in favor of construction.
   The agency's regional director, <PERSON>Mike Spear</PERSON>, upheld the study as
``biologically sound.'' But <DATE>last month</DATE>, after the construction site
was designated as a critical habitat, Spear called for another
study.

Yesterday's announcement from <ORGANIZATION>Storehouse</ORGANIZATION> confirms that the group is
toughening its attitude towards underperforming assets. The appointment of
Habitat's finance director as divisional chairman and chief executive
probably implies the imminent closure of the loss-making US operation. The
French stores have been alone in making a consistent success of the Habitat
concept, so Storehouse would doubtless smile on any bid from its French
management to take control of the rest of the division. If the shares failed
to react, it was doubtless because they are already discounting rather more
than this tinkering at the edges.

<HEAD>Old Stands to Receive More Protection Everywhere; Most Impact in
Northwest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New management policies, including fewer
controversial ``clear cuts,'' will be adopted to preserve more
old-growth trees in the national forests, the <ORGANIZATION>Forest Service</ORGANIZATION> said
<DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   <PERSON>George M. Leonard</PERSON>, associate chief of the service, said he
guessed the new policies would preserve about half the nation's old
growth stands _ more in some areas, less in others, depending on
the tree species involved in and other things.
   ``Not all of the old growth is going to be preserved,'' he said.
``My guess it's going to be substantially over half of the
remaining old growth (that) will be preserved,'' he said.
   The new policies will have the greatest impact on old-growth
forests in the <LOCATION>Pacific Northwest</LOCATION> but will be applied to all forests
in the system, including eastern hardwoods and soft pines of the
South.
   The old-growth forests _ often never cut before, and
distinguished by old trees and accumulations of dead material _
provide living space for many species of wildlife, including the
controversial spotted owl in the <LOCATION>Pacific Northwest</LOCATION>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> recently approved compromise provisions aimed at
protecting the owl in <MONEY>$11.2 billion</MONEY> spending measure for the
<ORGANIZATION>Interior Department</ORGANIZATION> and related agencies like the <ORGANIZATION>Forest Service</ORGANIZATION>,
an arm of the <ORGANIZATION>Agriculture Department</ORGANIZATION>.
   The legislation, designed to permit continued logging in the
old-growth forests of the <LOCATION>Pacific Northwest</LOCATION>, calls on the <ORGANIZATION>Forest
Service</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Interior's Bureau of Land Management</ORGANIZATION> to ``minimize
fragmentation of significant old-growth forest stand.'' No timber
sales would be allowed in areas already identified as spotted owl
habitat.
   Lawmakers sought a way to ensure <ORGANIZATION>Northwest</ORGANIZATION> mills of a steady
supply of timber from the region's old-growth forests while the
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Fish and <ORGANIZATION>Wildlife Service</ORGANIZATION> decides whether to declare the
northern spotted owl an endangered species.
   Such declarations require federal agencies to protect the
habitats of the species in question. The spotted owl lives almost
exclusively in old-growth forests and each nesting air requires a
very large area.
   Leonard said the <ORGANIZATION>Forest Service</ORGANIZATION> will reduce the use of
traditional clear-cutting methods in which all or most trees in an
area are cut, and will increase retention of snags, dead-and-down
material and logging debris that could be used by wildlife.
   Also some forest stands will be managed on ``extended
rotations'' to develop old-growth characteristics. Some of those
rotations would be for 150 to 200 years or longer.
   Agency Chief <PERSON>F. Dale Robertson</PERSON> said in a statement that ``we do
not anticipate an immediate impact on our timber sale program since
our forest plans provide for many old-growth values.''
   However, <PERSON>Robertson</PERSON> added that ``there will be an impact when we
complete the final forest plans in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Oregon</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, and as we amend or revise other forest plans due to a
greater emphasis on old-growth values.''
   Asked about wildlife species that might benefit from the new
policy's use in eastern hardwood forests, <PERSON>Leonard</PERSON> said the red
cockaded woodpecker in southern pine forests was one example but he
was not aware of any in old-growth hardwoods.
   ``But certainly we're looking at the impact of cutting and the
way we lay out our (timber) sales on bear habitat, on turkey
habitat,'' he said.
   <PERSON>Leonard</PERSON> said the recent years of controversy over old-growth
forests, the spotted owl and other environmental factors have been
fierce and will take time to heal.
   ``I've been involved in national forest management issues for
over 30 years, and I've never found a situation that was more
polarized than the issue over the management of the <LOCATION>Pacific
Northwest</LOCATION>,'' he said.

<HEAD>Final Search Planned Before Bird Declared Officially Extinct</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Environmentalists still nagged by the
demise of the last known dusky seaside sparrow plan a final search
of the bird's one-time habitat before writing an epitaph.
   A search of the area near <ORGANIZATION>Kennedy Space Center</ORGANIZATION> had been planned
for this <DATE>spring</DATE>, even though regional officials of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Fish
and <ORGANIZATION>Wildlife Service</ORGANIZATION> are convinced there are no more duskies.
   A final search will be conducted in about a year before the
dusky is declared extinct, said <PERSON>John Christian</PERSON>, deputy assistant
regional director of the wildlife service in <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>.
   State and federal officials sponsor the bird-watching expedition
in which volunteers will go through area with binoculars. If no
duskies are spotted, the species will be considered extinct.
   The last tiny dusky died of old age in <DATE>June</DATE> in a specially
designed environment on <LOCATION>Discovery Island</LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION>Walt Disney World</ORGANIZATION>
zoological park primarily for birds. The last five survivors, all
males, were taken there from their only known wildlife habitat on
<LOCATION>Cape Canaveral</LOCATION> <DATE>several years ago</DATE>.
   They were bred with close cousins, seeking to preserve their
genes, but they died one by one.
   The bird's decline began in the <DATE>1940s</DATE> when mosquito fighters
began spraying DDT over the <LOCATION>St. Johns River Refuge marshlands</LOCATION>,
ruining the duskies' eggs and insect food supply.
   Although they were protected by law, conservationists say the
birds did not have much chance against diking, drainage,
land-clearing, highway construction, housing developments,
mosquito-control projects and fires.
   ``We have laws protecting the species, but not the habitat,''
said <PERSON>John Wood</PERSON>, a federal official. ``You can protect the species
all you want, but if you don't have the habitat, they have no place
to go and won't make it.''
   But Christian pointed out that the 5,000-acre St. Johns refuge
was purchased for <MONEY>$3 million</MONEY> to protect the dusky.
   ``We thought we had enough habitat to sustain them, and then the
population just crashed,'' <PERSON>Christian</PERSON> said. ``We will never know
what biological mechanism was responsible. Nobody really knows.''
   <PERSON>Charles Cook</PERSON>, curator of <LOCATION>Discovery Island</LOCATION> and a leader in the
fight to preserve the dusky genes, said he hoped that someday some
of the part-duskies will be released on an experimental basis in
the protected area.
   Cook believes there is a chance one or more of the birds may
exist in a remote section of the refuge.
   ``Scientists always keep the option open,'' he said. ``I
definitely feel it is worth looking into, particularly in a
peripheral habitat not frequently visited by people.''

<BYLINE>Endangered Squirrel On National Forest Land Targeted For Ski Resort
^By PAIGE St. JOHN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An endangered species of flying
squirrels and a virgin stand of red spruce are in the way of a
developer's plan to turn a section of national forest into a <MONEY>$100
million</MONEY> ski resort.
   Environmentalists are mounting forces to oppose a proposal by
<ORGANIZATION>Laurel Creek Development Corp.</ORGANIZATION> to build a resort community on the
north slope of <ORGANIZATION>Big Spruce Mountain</ORGANIZATION>, which overlooks the <ORGANIZATION>Cranberry
Wilderness Area</ORGANIZATION> in eastern <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION>.
   The developer is negotiating with the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Forest Service</ORGANIZATION> to
swap another piece of forestland for the Big Spruce land.
   ``We're concerned about the precedent here, of swapping really
pristine land at the call of an out-of-state developer,'' said <PERSON>Mary
Wimmer</PERSON>, conservation chairwoman for the <ORGANIZATION>West Virginia Sierra Club</ORGANIZATION>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Laurel Creek</ORGANIZATION> officials joined with Gov. <PERSON>Arch Moore</PERSON> last week to
announce the development, which has sold 100 club memberships
already, starting at <MONEY>$15,000</MONEY> each. The governor claimed <ORGANIZATION>Laurel
Creek</ORGANIZATION> could create as many as 2,300 jobs in four years, counting
spin-off services. Building lots will cost between <MONEY>$100,000</MONEY> and
<MONEY>$500,000</MONEY>, <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> said.
   But <ORGANIZATION>Laurel Creek</ORGANIZATION> does not yet own the heart of its project _ the
top of the mountain, which has an elevation of 4,695 feet. Without
it, officials said <DATE>Monday</DATE>, the resort would have no long ski runs.
   Joined with 1,000 to 2,000 acres of land <ORGANIZATION>Laurel Creek</ORGANIZATION> already
owns, the company would create a 2,300-acre complex with two golf
courses, 32 ski runs, seven restaurants, lodges, cabins and houses.
   The mountaintop is a scarce habitat for the <LOCATION>Northern Virginia</LOCATION>
flying squirrel, which lives in only a few areas of the state.
   The rust-colored, palm-sized animals roam the woods at night,
gliding among the tree tops. The flying squirrels have disappeared
over most of their <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> range for unknown reasons, but
environmentalists blame the decline on a loss of habitat.
   The squirrels like mature red spruce stands, which are
experiencing problems in the region.
   ``The spruce decline along the whole Appalachian corridor is
very serious. It is becoming very scarce,'' <PERSON>Wimmer</PERSON> said. ``These
areas need to be set aside.''
   She said she also is waiting for the <ORGANIZATION>Forest Service</ORGANIZATION> to check the
mountain for other endangered species, including the Cheat Mountain
salamander, which lives in red spruce forests.
   Local trout fishermen also are concerned the resort would
pollute Day Run, a trout stream, and in turn hurt the <LOCATION>Williams
River</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Cranberry River</LOCATION>, which flows through
nationally-protected wilderness areas.
   And conservationalists have another problem _ the way the matter
has been handled.
   While the development was announced publicly last week, it was
revealed that the corporation began talking privately with the
<ORGANIZATION>Forest Service</ORGANIZATION> a year ago a land swap.
   ``We feel there's been way too much work done without local
input on this,'' <PERSON>Wimmer</PERSON> said.
   <PERSON>Richard Trochlil</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Forest Service</ORGANIZATION> office in <ORGANIZATION>Elkins</ORGANIZATION> said
<ORGANIZATION>Laurel Creek</ORGANIZATION> had made no firm trade offers. To be acceptable, the
land must match Big Spruce's stands of red spruce, he said.
   He said there was no available figure on how much of the
mountain would be cut for ski slopes.
   He said the mountain is not a wilderness area, and that three to
four Forest Service-supervised logging operations already are
cutting trees in the national forest.
   <ORGANIZATION>Laurel Creek</ORGANIZATION> officials did not return repeated telephone
messages left this week.

<HEAD>Forest Service Authorizes Telescopes on Mount Graham</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Forest Service</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>Thursday</DATE> it
had authorized the <ORGANIZATION>University of Arizona</ORGANIZATION> to build three telescopes
on <ORGANIZATION>Mount Graham</ORGANIZATION> after determining construction wouldn't harm an
endangered squirrel.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Justice</ORGANIZATION> and Agriculture departments signed off on the
project, saying a study by the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Fish</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Wildlife Service</ORGANIZATION> had
satisfied worries that the observatory, which would include the
world's most powerful telescope, would threaten the habitat of the
<LOCATION>Mount Graham</LOCATION> red squirrel.
   ``As soon as we can we'll sign relevant construction documents
and obtain our permit,'' said university spokesman <PERSON>Steve Emerine</PERSON>.
He said work would begin as soon as possible.
   <ORGANIZATION>Maricopa Audubon Society</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>Robin Silver</PERSON> said in <LOCATION>Phoenix</LOCATION>
that attorneys for environmental groups opposed to the <MONEY>$200 million</MONEY>
project would be in court by <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME> seeking a temporary
restraining order.
   Expert witnesses in the hearing ``will now include members of
<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>, the Fish and <ORGANIZATION>Wildlife Service</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Forest Service</ORGANIZATION> biologists
and the <ORGANIZATION>General Acounting Office</ORGANIZATION>,'' Silver said.
   Rep. <PERSON>Morris K. Udall</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-Ariz.</LOCATION>, and other members of the <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>
delegation oppose construction of the telescopes without further
study. <PERSON>Udall</PERSON> was out of town and couldn't be reached for comment.
   A survey earlier this year determined there were fewer than 150
of the half-pound rodents _ one of 25 genetically distinct
subspecies of the red squirrel _ scurrying over the mossy,
spruce-covered slopes of 10,500-foot Emerald Peak.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Justice Department</ORGANIZATION> had been reviewing a recommendation by a
team at the Fish and <ORGANIZATION>Wildlife Service</ORGANIZATION> that another biological study
be undertaken before construction begins on the mountain 125 miles
northeast of <LOCATION>Tucson</LOCATION>.
   Emerine said the university would work with the <ORGANIZATION>Forest Service</ORGANIZATION>
and Fish and <ORGANIZATION>Wildlife Service</ORGANIZATION> to create a buffer zone around the
construction site so as not to disturb the squirrel.
   A statement from <PERSON>George M. Leonard</PERSON>, associate chief of the
<ORGANIZATION>Forest Service</ORGANIZATION>, said further consultations would be made if the
project resulted in the deaths of more than six squirrels in any
one year.
   The university proposed the construction of the observatory in
<DATE>1984</DATE>. Its partners include the <ORGANIZATION>Smithsonian Institution</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Max
Planck Observatory</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Vatican Observatory</ORGANIZATION>.
   In <DATE>March</DATE>, <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> District <PERSON>Judge Alfredo C. Marquez</PERSON> granted the
request of environmental groups and issued a four-month injunction
barring construction on <ORGANIZATION>Emerald Peak</ORGANIZATION>. But an appeals court in <LOCATION>San
Francisco</LOCATION> overturned the delay in <DATE>May</DATE>.
   <ORGANIZATION>General Accounting Office</ORGANIZATION> investigators testified before a
congressional hearing in late <DATE>June</DATE> that the squirrel's fate had
become more precarious since the <DATE>1988</DATE> congressional act that
authorized construction of the telescopes.
   A springtime count indicated there were between 132 and 146 of
the squirrels left on the mountain, their only habitat.

<TEXT>
   Habitat for <ORGANIZATION>Humanity</ORGANIZATION>'s founder is keeping
some people at arm's length while its leaders and backers struggle
with allegations that he improperly hugged and touched five female
workers.
   The allegations have sent founder <PERSON>Millard Fuller</PERSON> into near exile
and put an uncharacteristic strain on Habitat, a strongly religious
organization that uses ``sweat equity'' to build housing for the
poor around the world. It has a <MONEY>$50 million</MONEY> budget and 100,000 <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
volunteers, including former President <PERSON>Carter</PERSON>.
   ``It has been a situation that has caused a lot of pain because
we're all very close,'' said <PERSON>Claire Williams</PERSON>, spokeswoman for
Habitat's board.
   Fuller, who says he only touched the women in exuberant shows of
friendship, still can be found chatting with Habitat volunteers.
But he avoids the headquarters and is careful how he greets people.
   ``I no longer initiate hugs,'' he said in an interview <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
``When charges of this nature are made, it's very difficult to
defend yourself.''
   No criminal charges have been filed against Fuller, 55. The
women have not been identified, and their allegations have been
described only in general terms.
   <PERSON>Geoff Van Loucks</PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Habitat for Humanity International
Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, has said the women alleged ``nothing criminal'' when they
complained to a Habitat chaplain.
   ``They claim inappropriate comments and inappropriate hugging
and touching. They've never, ever claimed anything more. Nor is
there a hint of anything more,'' Van <PERSON>Loucks</PERSON> said. ``Let me make
clear there was no sexual intercourse.''
   Fuller, who founded Habitat with his wife, <PERSON>Linda</PERSON>, also is to
move his base of operations to <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>. Because of a reorganization
that was planned before the controversy, he has gone from executve
director to president.
   The organization also hired the <ORGANIZATION>Mennonite Conciliation Service</ORGANIZATION>
to counsel Fuller and the women. But there have been divisions over
whether enough has been done.
   <PERSON>Tim O'Donnell</PERSON>, who recently finished a 2{-year term at the
headquarters, said he received a harsh handwritten note from <PERSON>Carter</PERSON>
after <PERSON>O'Donnell</PERSON> complained about the way the board investigated the
claims against Fuller.
   ``You are either completely foolish or trying to sabotage the
work of Habitat,'' said a copy of the letter provided by <PERSON>O'Donnell</PERSON>.
``Attacking <PERSON>Millard Fuller</PERSON> and the board of directors is a
reprehensible act. ... Don't make it more difficult for those
trying to resolve the problem.''
   <PERSON>Carter</PERSON> spokeswoman <PERSON>Carrie Harmon</PERSON> declined to comment on the
letter's authenticity.
   <PERSON>Carter</PERSON>, who annually spends at least a week working at Habitat
homebuilding projects, has publicly defended Fuller. In a recent
interview with <ORGANIZATION>The Atlanta Journal-Constitution</ORGANIZATION>, he said the nature
of the accusations upset the ``extremely conservative'' board
members, who then were ``overly inclined to condemn'' Fuller.
   Fuller still is a visible presence in <LOCATION>Americus</LOCATION>, a town of 16,000
about 10 miles from <PERSON>Carter</PERSON>'s hometown of <LOCATION>Plains</LOCATION>. Fuller now works
out of his law office, a few blocks from <LOCATION>Habitat</LOCATION>'s headquarters.
   Fuller, a former millionaire who gave away his money in <DATE>1970</DATE> and
founded Habitat in <DATE>1976</DATE>, said he has apologized to all five women
and met personally with three of them.
   ``When someone says they have been offended, the common-sense
thing and the Christian thing is to seek reconciliation,'' he said.
``I'm not trying to paint myself as a perfect person who has been
victimized. I obviously was not sensitive enough in my relations
with these women.''
   Back at Habitat headquarters, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> businessman <PERSON>Jeff
Snider</PERSON>, who arrived <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, has taken over as executive vice
president in charge of operations.
   As a reporter arrived, a male employee greeted a female
receptionist with a hug.
   <PERSON>Ms. Williams</PERSON>, the board spokeswoman, said, ``We've seen progress
in the two or three months it's been going on.''
   But <PERSON>O'Donnell</PERSON> said the controversy has taken a toll at the
organization, which has over 450 projects in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> and more than 80 in 26 developing countries.
   ``People almost feel they have to take sides,'' he said. ``I
know of a handful of people who have left because of the
situation.''
   Fuller said he wants to focus on the future.
   He said his promotion to president and the opening of a Habitat
office in <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> are part of a long-range plan developed last year
that just happened to coincide with the controversy. Fuller said he
helped pick <PERSON>Snider</PERSON> to run Habitat.
   ``Because of the timing, it appears that I'm being run out of
town,'' said Fuller. ``I want us to get on with the business of
building houses for the needy.''

<TEXT>
   Former President <PERSON>Jimmy Carter</PERSON> and three
members of a Soviet volunteer organization have agreed to work
jointly on housing projects for the needy next <DATE>summer</DATE> in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>
state and the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Carter</PERSON> met <DATE>Sunday</DATE> with the Soviet delegation at his home in
<LOCATION>Plains</LOCATION>. He is active in <LOCATION>Habitat</LOCATION> for Humanity, a group that builds
homes for the working poor.
   ``One of the things they (the Russians) wanted to do was housing
work for the benefit of low-income people with children, and Habitat
fit the bill,'' said <PERSON>Millard Fuller</PERSON>, Habitat's executive director,
who also attended the meeting with the Soviets.
   ``We decided that next <DATE>summer</DATE> a group of 10 Soviets will come to
<LOCATION>Yakima</LOCATION> and work with 10 Americans on the Habitat project there for
five or six weeks,'' <PERSON>Fuller</PERSON> said. ``Then the group will go to the
<LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> and work on a similar project there.''
   Habitat has conducted home-building projects in more than 300
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> cities as well as <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> and developing nations.
   The Soviets delagation are members of a private volunteer
organization, the Soviet Peace Fund, and were invited to the <LOCATION>United
States</LOCATION> by Ploughshares, a Seattle-based organization.
   The Soviet delegation included <PERSON>Svetlana Savitskaya</PERSON>, the first
woman cosmonaut to walk in space.
   ``It's very important to look at each other eye to eye,'' said
<PERSON>Ms. Savitskaya</PERSON>, who added that the project will help promote peace.
``This will help us to see there are not enemies among us but good
friends.''
   The project's ultimate goal is to have the Soviets and Americans
working side-by-side in developing nations, organizers said, but no
decision on that was reached.

<TEXT>
   Evictions, maintenance complaints and other
landlord-tenant disputes are plaguing a low-cost housing project for
the formerly homeless that was called a miracle by former President
<PERSON>Jimmy Carter</PERSON>.
   <PERSON>Carter</PERSON> helped put up the four-townhouse complex in <DATE>1986</DATE> through
his association with Habitat for Humanity, a non-profit Christian
organization based in <LOCATION>Americus</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ga.</LOCATION>, that builds and rehabilitates
houses for the homeless nationwide.
   Tenants, who help construct the buildings, are selected by a
Habitat screening committee.
   In <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>, tenants are complaining of verbal abuse, poor
construction and unanswered pleas for help.
   Habitat officials say the tenants aren't meeting their
obligations.
   A family of eight was evicted <DATE>earlier this month</DATE> for not paying
rent, the second eviction in nine months at the four-unit complex.
   ``None of us can believe what is happening,'' said <PERSON>Arbie Nelson</PERSON>,
a mother of seven who owes <MONEY>$1,000</MONEY> in rent and is fighting in court
to avoid seeing her family become the third evicted.
   Habitat can't be expected to pick up the tab, said <PERSON>Patrick Keen</PERSON>,
an official with a Habitat chapter in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>.
   ``It's painful that we have to take these kinds of actions
against families, because it's contrary to everything we stand for
in trying to reform these people,'' <PERSON>Keen</PERSON> said. ``But everyone that
claims to need help doesn't deserve help, and people who are not
living up to the very basic obligation of the minimal amount
expected of them _ well, we had no other choice.''
   Several families were threatened with eviction in <DATE>July 1987</DATE> after
falling behind in their rent. They said heating and maintenance
problems led to huge utility bills and other problems.
   Habitat founder <PERSON>Millard Fuller</PERSON> and the group's West Side chapter
reached an agreement with the families, reducing rents from <MONEY>$300</MONEY> to
<MONEY>$264</MONEY> and promising to correct the problems.
   Keen said the group had no choice but to begin evictions when
tenants continued to withhold rent.
   The latest to lose their apartment were <PERSON>Vivian</PERSON> and <PERSON>Marvin Abrams</PERSON>
and their eight children.
   <PERSON>Mrs. Abrams</PERSON> said she returned home earlier this month to find her
children huddled outside in the cold and the family's possessions
strewn along the curb.
   The family owed <MONEY>$1,300</MONEY> in rent, but <PERSON>Mrs. Abrams</PERSON> said she had
withheld some payments to protest unfinished work on the building.
   She said she had just found a job when sheriff's deputies arrived
with the eviction notice.
   ``We helped build that house, my 14-year-old and I,'' she said.
``When I heard what was happening, I rushed home with my new boss,
and we begged and pleaded with <PERSON>Mr. Keen</PERSON>.
   ``My boss pledged to pay whatever Keen wanted, and the sheriff
said it was up to <PERSON>Mr. Keen</PERSON>, but <PERSON>Patrick Keen</PERSON> said `No,''' <PERSON>Mrs.
Abrams</PERSON> said.
   Keen said he was told by Habitat officials in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> to throw
the family out.
   ``There was an error made in evicting that family,'' <PERSON>Fuller</PERSON> said
<DATE>Monday</DATE>. ``People are going to think Habitat is a heartless
organization that throws mothers and children out in the street in
the dead of winter. That is not the case. This is the first time
anybody has been evicted.''
   Fuller said the group's regional director will be directed to
``fully investigate just what the situation is in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>, so we can
rectify it.''
   ``We are aware that <LOCATION>West Side Habitat</LOCATION> has had rental problems
with these families,'' <PERSON>Fuller</PERSON> said. But ``two wrongs don't make a
right.''
   Fuller said that of 324 cities in which Habitat operates, ``We
have had more trouble in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> than any other city. Only <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>
has had similar problems.''

   <PERSON>Willie B.</PERSON> and the other gorillas in a new ``rain
forest'' at <LOCATION>Zoo Atlanta</LOCATION> seemed to take it in stride when the
general public was admitted to the attraction for the first time.
   Thousands of people streamed into the <ORGANIZATION>Ford African Rain Forest</ORGANIZATION>
after a ribbon-cutting ceremony <DATE>Saturday</DATE> to strain for a look at
<PERSON>Willie B.</PERSON>, the zoo's biggest star, in the lush open-air habitat
which replaced the cage he occupied for 27 years.
   The 450-pound gorilla, now about 30 years old, immediately came
to the edge of a restraining moat to strut for the crowd; once, he
ran down a grassy slope, drawing applause.
   On each side, across moats, two families of gorillas recently
brought to the zoo kept a greater distance from onlookers but
remained mostly in the open and not in their shelters.
   Zoo Director <PERSON>Terry Maple</PERSON> said the gorillas, while physically
separated, have interacted in the 2{ weeks they have been together.
   ``They're vocalizing, they're beating their chests, they're
moving this way and influencing the others,'' <PERSON>Maple</PERSON> said. ``The
behavior of animals is enhanced by the presence of others.''
   Zoo Business Manager <PERSON>Dennis Baker</PERSON> said a record for paid
attendance at the zoo was set <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, and broken <DATE>Sunday</DATE>. <DATE>Sunday</DATE>'s
crowd was 11,860, with 10,893 paid, passing the mark of 8,522 set
<DATE>Saturday</DATE>, when there were also nearly 5,000 free admissions.
   The zoo's best attendance was 17,000 in <DATE>1986</DATE> when there was free
admission to celebrate <PERSON>Willie B.</PERSON>'s birthday, but the record paid
attendance before <DATE>Saturday</DATE> was about 7,400, <PERSON>Baker</PERSON> said.
   The four-acre, <MONEY>$4.5 million</MONEY> rain forest, boosted by <MONEY>$1 million</MONEY>
donated by the <ORGANIZATION>Ford Motor Co.</ORGANIZATION>, is the centerpiece of a renovation
of the 99-year-old zoo, dubbed one of the 10 worst in the country
by the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Humane Society</ORGANIZATION> only <DATE>four years ago</DATE>.
   Three gorilla families, including the two already present, are
being provided by the <ORGANIZATION>Yerkes Regional Primate Research Center</ORGANIZATION> at
<LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Emory University</ORGANIZATION>.
   The exhibit includes an adjacent aviary, featuring birds from
the same areas of <LOCATION>West Africa</LOCATION> inhabited by the gorillas.
   It is the second of 10 habitats planned; a flamingo habitat
opened first. Next year, <ORGANIZATION>Maple</ORGANIZATION> said, the zoo will present an east
African savanna, featuring lions and elephants and including a pool
deep enough for an elephant to immerse itself.

FT  18 OCT 93 / UK Company News: An attempt at reviving the Habitat habit -
Swedish owner wants the home furnishings chain to return to its roots
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR <PERSON>VITTORIO Radice</PERSON>, managing director of <ORGANIZATION>Habitat UK</ORGANIZATION>, whips out a picture of
six swarthy men intent on a serious game of boules. One lounges in a deck
chair, munching his way through an overstuffed sandwich. 'This is what I use
to describe what Habitat is all about,' <PERSON>Mr Radice</PERSON> says. Under the photograph
is a single word - comfortable.
Tomorrow <PERSON>Mr Radice</PERSON> hopes to paint a fuller picture of his vision for the
home furnishings retail chain with something slightly more obvious - the
opening of the revamped flagship store on the <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s Road in <LOCATION>Chelsea</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>London</LOCATION>. Here in a <DATE>1930s</DATE> cinema restored to its former Art Deco glory, he
will attempt to convince customers that Habitat's future lies in recapturing
its past. 'We have put one word back into the equation - passion,' he says.
That philosophy is shared by Stichting Ingka, the trust set up by <PERSON>Mr Ingvar
Kamprad</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION>'s guru of affordable chic and founder of the <ORGANIZATION>Ikea</ORGANIZATION> retailing
phenomenon. It is almost a year to the day since the trust bought Habitat's
European operations from <ORGANIZATION>Storehouse for Pounds</ORGANIZATION> 78m.
<PERSON>Mr Kamprad</PERSON>, like his UK managing director, believes the way forward for
Habitat lies in returning to its roots as a retailer of quality design
furnishings at affordable prices. Recently he wrote to Sir <PERSON>Terence Conran</PERSON>,
Habitat's founder, to reassure him that Stichting intended to revive the
spirit behind that first shop he opened on <ORGANIZATION>Fulham Road</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1964</DATE>.
The mistakes of the past have been well documented. Sir <PERSON>Terence Conran</PERSON>'s
original concept lost its way in the mid- to late <DATE>1980s</DATE> when new management
sought to drive the company for dividend and volume growth. .
While the continental businesses were left to follow their own path, the <ORGANIZATION>UK</ORGANIZATION>
division had four management and strategy changes in six years, and made
significant losses.
There have been few changes since Stichting took over last year. Many of the
most significant shifts - such as abandoning the out of town wastelands and
returning Habitat to its high street roots - had already been launched by <PERSON>Mr
Radice</PERSON> when he arrived from a Milanese furniture company in <DATE>1990</DATE>.
However, Stichting made what <PERSON>Mr Radice</PERSON> considers to be one of the most
important decisions for the chain's future as an international brand. Within
weeks of the takeover, Habitat's headquarters were moved from <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> to
<LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>. 'Now we are seriously working to make this one business,' <PERSON>Mr Radice</PERSON>
says. 'A global view can only (be achieved) if we are run as one business.'
The two divisions will share an increasing proportion of products and ranges
in their catalogues. Habitat UK's catalogue is already showing a greater
emphasis on the simple, timeless furniture for which Habitat was originally
renowned and which the French business never abandoned.
The design teams of both divisions are also encouraged to share the colour
schemes and influences which form the basis of their furnishings. Shared
sourcing and distribution are natural goals, which previously had been
largely ignored.
Now, says <PERSON>Mr Radice</PERSON>, Habitat is back on track to make significant profits
and is more focused on the type of customer it wants to attract than it has
been for years. 'We want a customer with some passion, some heart,' <PERSON>Mr
Radice</PERSON> insists. 'One that has confidence to say THIS is the glass I like.'
Comfort will be the driving force behind the product offer, rather than the
creation of a stylised look such as that offered in Habitat catalogues of
the <DATE>1980s</DATE>. 'Ours is a catalogue of ideas,' <PERSON>Mr Radice</PERSON> says. 'That was a
hardware catalogue.'
<PERSON>Mr Radice</PERSON> says he is determined to recreate the atmosphere that made Sir
<PERSON>Terence</PERSON>'s stores so popular. 'It should be a place to meet, not to buy,' he
says. Thus, the plans for an elegant but affordable cafe - Italian of course
 -above the <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s Road shop.
Habitat's commitment to opening new shops in unusual sites - much as Sir
<PERSON>Terence</PERSON> sought out churches and cinemas for his original stores - is also
part of <PERSON>Mr Radice</PERSON>'s Habitat revival.
While most welcome the shift in emphasis which has become apparent over the
<DATE>last 18 months</DATE>, there are those who warn of the dangers of becoming too
focused on an image which does not have mass market appeal.
'There is a fine dividing line between being focused and limiting your
potential,' says <PERSON>Ms Hilary Monk</PERSON> of the market research organisation Verdict.
Sir <PERSON>Terence</PERSON> agrees. While praising the group's success in 'throwing off the
Storehouse glooms', he says: 'It worries me that Habitat has given up some
of the very straightforward, very everyday things we used to sell so
success-fully.'
For the moment, however, <PERSON>Mr Radice</PERSON> has other things on his mind; most
immediately, the relaunch of the <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s Road site. To commemorate the
occasion, he is frantically searching for the desert epic with which the
<ORGANIZATION>Gaumont Palace</ORGANIZATION> cinema opened in <DATE>1934</DATE> - The Camels are Coming.
<PERSON>Mr Radice</PERSON>, a lively Italian proud of his unorthodox managerial methods, is
also angling to make his entrance on the back of a camel. This time,
however, the Stichting board may have other ideas.

   <PERSON>Cheryl Hayes</PERSON> says she won't forget the hundreds
of volunteers who in one week made her dream of a new home a reality
in the heart of <LOCATION>Milwaukee</LOCATION>'s inner city.
   ``They'll never leave; their spirits will always be here,'' she
said. ``It's a house made of love.''
   <PERSON>Ms. Hayes</PERSON>, 40, a social worker and divorced mother of three, owns
one of six homes built last week by the Georgia-based Habitat for
<ORGANIZATION>Humanity International</ORGANIZATION>.
   The site is near where 12 people died two years ago in the city's
deadliest house fire. Less than three weeks after the blaze, a house
fire several blocks away killed six people. The death toll focused
attention on housing ills for the largely minority population of the
inner city.
   Now, <PERSON>Ms. Hayes</PERSON>, who is black, sees the efforts of Habitat as part
of a rebirth of the neighborhood where she has lived nearly a decade.
   ``This is a beautiful neighborhood,'' she said. ``This is going
to be THE neighborhood someday.''
   Former President <PERSON>Carter</PERSON> and <PERSON>Millard Fuller</PERSON>, executive director of
the organization, also think so.
   <PERSON>Carter</PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON>Rosalynn</PERSON>, spent last week working on one of
the homes. For the former president, it was the sixth year he has
spent a week pounding nails and putting up walls in a Habitat home.
   ``I just know what's happened in other places where we've worked;
it kind of rejuvenates the people,'' he said. ``The whole
neighborhood tries to stay up with them. They kind of set a
pattern.''
   The crews in <LOCATION>Milwaukee</LOCATION> also renovated eight other homes last week.
   Habitat officials said similar work has occurred in about 150
communities around the world as part of efforts to build more than
3,000 homes for low-income people this year.
   Habitat, founded by <ORGANIZATION>Fuller</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1976</DATE> and based in <LOCATION>Americus</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ga.</LOCATION>, is
an ecumenical Christian organization that uses volunteer labor and
donated material to produce housing for needy people.
   The homes are sold for no profit with no-interest loans. The
<LOCATION>Milwaukee</LOCATION> homes cost from <MONEY>$24,000</MONEY> to <MONEY>$26,000</MONEY>, with principal
payments on the 10-20 year mortgages to range from <MONEY>$100</MONEY> to <MONEY>$250</MONEY> a
month.
   Each buyer must put in 500 hours of labor that's called ``sweat
equity.'' The buyers work on several homes.
   ``It has a very positive impact for the families involved,'' said
<PERSON>Walter Farrell</PERSON>, a professor at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee</ORGANIZATION>
and a board member of the <ORGANIZATION>First Wisconsin Bank's Community
Involvement Corp</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``Beyond that, it's only going to have a neighborhood impact if
there are other projects in the area, ... if the houses do not
become oases in an area of dilapidated houses.''
   He said census data show that vacant or substandard housing in
the central city is as high as 25 to <PERCENT>30 percent</PERCENT>. Officials estimate
800 dwellings are abandoned.
   Taking a break from installing siding on a house, <ORGANIZATION>Fuller</ORGANIZATION> said the
whole community should work toward eliminating substandard housing
and homelessness by the year <DATE>2000</DATE>.
   ``This is only one week, but what if we did it every week? What
if everybody was concerned every week about everybody having a
house? The problem would be solved in a very few years.''
   <PERSON>Ms. Hayes</PERSON> and <PERSON>Diana Wilson</PERSON>, another of the six new homeowners,
said the project stirred interest in the black community. It also
stirred their emotions.
   <PERSON>Ms. Wilson</PERSON>, 36, a school bus driver and nurse's aide who will
live in the house with her two sons, said she arrived at her new
home at <TIME>6:10 a.m. one day</TIME>. No one was there.
   ``I was walking around, looking at the rooms, and I didn't even
realize I was crying. The tears were just running down my face,''
she said.

   They're few in number, and their sky-island
habitat has long lain undisturbed. But 180 tiny <ORGANIZATION>Mount Graham</ORGANIZATION> red
squirrels could prove a big obstacle to construction of the world's
most powerful optical telescope.
   The <ORGANIZATION>University of Arizona</ORGANIZATION> wants nothing more than to coexist
with the mountaintop rodents, an endangered subspecies. But the
builder of a <MONEY>$200 million</MONEY> observatory atop 10,709-foot Mount <PERSON>Graham</PERSON>
is having to tread carefully.
   The 8-ounce squirrel, or Tamiasciurus hudsonicus grahamensis,
has touched off a two-year ecological controversy that has split
the scientific community, pitted one federal agency against
another, and drawn environmentalists into a battle against
telescope proponents from as far away as the <ORGANIZATION>Vatican</ORGANIZATION>.
   <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> District <PERSON>Judge Alfredo C. Marquez</PERSON> will hear closing
arguments <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME> on whether a third federal biological
study is needed before construction begins this year on two smaller
telescopes.
   If all goes smoothly, the <ORGANIZATION>Columbus Project</ORGANIZATION>, a 600-inch-diameter
device expected to be six times more powerful than any telescope in
use, will be built in the mid-1990s on the 8.6-acre tract in the
<LOCATION>Pinaleno Mountains</LOCATION> 110 miles northeast of <LOCATION>Tucson</LOCATION>.
   Just 180 of the squirrels, which have been traced back 10,000
years or more, are believed to remain, and <PERSON>Mount Graham</PERSON> is their
only known habitat.
   Opposition groups say perching the telescopes on Emerald Peak,
one of Mount <PERSON>Graham</PERSON>'s three peaks, can only assure that the
squirrels become a biological footnote.
   ``It's biologically indefensible to develop on that mountain,''
said <PERSON>Dr. Robin Silver</PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION>Maricopa Audubon Society</ORGANIZATION>.
``We will win this case. The question is will we win it before the
university wreaks too much destruction on the mountain?''
   The university, argued its vice president for research, <PERSON>Michael
Cusanovich</PERSON>, ``is the most likely participant to provide the basis
for the Mount <PERSON>Graham</PERSON> red squirrel's recovery.'' It spent more than
<MONEY>$200,000</MONEY> last year on research and monitoring and will put aside
more than <MONEY>$100,000</MONEY> annually for several years, he said.
   A two-mile access road for the <ORGANIZATION>Mount Graham International
Observatory</ORGANIZATION> has already been built. But opponents have so far held
up construction of the observatory buildings.
   The squirrels apparently have some militant supporters. One
mailed an anonymous death threat to telescope proponent <PERSON>Conrad
Istock</PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION>University of Arizona</ORGANIZATION>'s ecology and
evolutionary biology department.
   Eleven of the department's 28 faculty members and 41 of 58
graduate students have voiced opposition to the observatory. But
students at the 38,000-student university later voted down by <PERCENT>57
percent</PERCENT> to <PERCENT>43 percent</PERCENT> a nonbinding initiative opposing the
observatory. Fewer than 5,000 students voted.
   In <DATE>July 1988</DATE>, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Fish and <ORGANIZATION>Wildlife Service</ORGANIZATION> concluded in a
biological report for the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Forest Service</ORGANIZATION>, the site's landlord,
that the telescopes could coexist with the squirrel.
   <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>'s congressional delegation then pushed through
legislation ordering the <ORGANIZATION>Forest Service</ORGANIZATION> to grant the university a
special-use permit allowing construction.
   But an environmental coalition intervened with a lawsuit.
Naturalists have staged demonstrations outside the <ORGANIZATION>Vatican Embassy</ORGANIZATION>
and the <ORGANIZATION>Smithsonian</ORGANIZATION> Institution in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>.
   The university says it will advertise soon for construction bids
for the two smaller telescopes, one of which is partly financed by
the <ORGANIZATION>Vatican Observatory</ORGANIZATION>. Pope <PERSON>John Paul II</PERSON> is among the <ORGANIZATION>Vatican</ORGANIZATION>'s
astronomy buffs.
   Two biologists who took part in the Fish and <ORGANIZATION>Wildlife Service</ORGANIZATION>
study alleged in depositions that officials at the agency ordered
researchers to argue in favor of construction.
   The agency's regional director, <PERSON>Mike Spear</PERSON>, upheld the study as
``biologically sound.'' But, last month, after the construction
site was designated as a critical habitat, Spear called for a
review study.
   However, the <ORGANIZATION>Forest Service</ORGANIZATION> says the congressional act
authorizes the first three telescopes and exempts them from further
review.
   Spear said the Endangered Species Act makes clear there should
be reconsultation before change in the habitat, while <ORGANIZATION>Forest
Service</ORGANIZATION> regional chief <PERSON>Dave Jolly</PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> intentionally
skirted the Act.
   University officials contend that poor cone crops in recent
years have hurt the squirrel population, that hunting, logging, use
of off-road vehicles and Christmas tree-cutting have been stopped
because of the planned observatory, and that 60 to 80 acres will be
reforested.
   Silver, who is a wildlife photographer, likened the squirrel's
predicament to that of the snail darter, a 3-inch fish that delayed
the <LOCATION>Tennessee River</LOCATION> dam project for six years during the <DATE>1970s</DATE>
before it was transplanted to the <LOCATION>Hiwassee River</LOCATION>.
   ``They're very similar in that the developmental groups managed
to ignore ecosystem destruction and focused the issue on one
creature that was easily demeaned in their project,'' Silver said.
   The dam was completed with <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> first amending the
Endangered Species Act in <DATE>1978</DATE> to allow an exemption from the law,
then exempting the dam from any law that would hinder its
construction, he said.
   <PERSON>Dan Campbell</PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION>Nature Conservancy</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>,
says <LOCATION>Mount Graham</LOCATION> has <ORGANIZATION>Arizona</ORGANIZATION>'s greatest density of black bears,
and is the farthest south that elk can be found in the <LOCATION>United
States</LOCATION>.
   ``It's the general habitat which we really need to protect and
conserve in order to protect the species,'' he said. ``It's like a
lifeboat. If you keep the lifeboat from sinking, then the species
stay there.''
