   Zookeepers and elephants are mourning the death
of the <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> Zoo's oldest and most popular elephant, a
10,000-pound matriarch that led the herd for 47 years and
entertained millions of tourists.
   The 51-year-old Asian elephant, named <PERSON>Lucki</PERSON>, was put to sleep
<DATE>Sunday</DATE> because her health had deteriorated to where she could no
longer stand, even with the help of a forklift, said spokesman <PERSON>Jeff
Jouett</PERSON>.
   ``She was one of most popular and best-loved animals at the
zoo,'' said <PERSON>Jouett</PERSON>, who estimated that 102 million tourists had
seen her over the years.
   <PERSON>Lucki</PERSON>, who came to <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> in <DATE>1941</DATE> from a zoo in <LOCATION>Calcutta</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>India</LOCATION>, was the zoo's biggest and most dominant elephant. She stood
9 feet at the shoulder.
   ``It's a major passage in the zoo elephant herd when the
matriarch dies,'' <PERSON>Jouett</PERSON> said. ``The current elephant keepers love
her dearly and are stunned by her loss. ... It's a subdued day at
the zoo.''
   About 10 years ago, <PERSON>Lucki</PERSON> started suffering from chronic tooth
and foot ailments, <PERSON>Jouett</PERSON> said.
   In <DATE>1981</DATE>, <PERSON>Lucki</PERSON> became the first captive elephant to have a tooth
pulled. Keepers regularly trimmed her foot pads to lessen her
problems, which were caused by lack of exercise.
   But during the past week, her condition worsened because of an
infection in her front feet. <DATE>Sunday</DATE> morning <PERSON>Lucki</PERSON> was unable to
stand.
   ``The veterinarian believes she reputured the muscles in (her)
back legs while trying to push herself up,'' <PERSON>Jouett</PERSON> said. ``They
tried coaxing her up. They brought in a forklift with a crane
attached. There was no way she could move.''
   After consulting with elephant keepers and curator of mammals
<PERSON>Rick Barongi</PERSON>, veterinarian <PERSON>Don Janssen</PERSON> injected the fatal shot of a
drug, the spokesman said.
   Among the witnesses were the zoo's director, <PERSON>Doug Myers</PERSON>, who
came in on his day off, and eight former or present elephant
keepers. The zoo's five other elephants were brought in later.
   ``Elephants are very intelligent and they can understand why one
of their own is no longer with them,'' <PERSON>Jouett</PERSON> said. ``They do a
very similar thing in the wild, so Maya and other elephants got an
hour to pay last respects.''
   Maya is a 49-year-old Asian elephant that came from <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> with
<PERSON>Lucki</PERSON> and was her best friend, he said.
   As matriarch, <PERSON>Lucki</PERSON> was always the first in the herd to eat and
enter the yard from the barn, <PERSON>Jouett</PERSON> said. She also was responsible
for disciplining members of the herd, as well as defending it from
intruders.
   Asian elephants have lived to nearly age 70 in captivity, but
are believed to have shorter life spans in the wild, <PERSON>Jouett</PERSON> said.
<PERSON>Lucki</PERSON>'s body was transported to the zoo's hospital for a necropsy.

<HEAD>Matriarch of San Diego Zoo Elephant Herd Euthanized After Accident</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A 51-year-old elephant at the <LOCATION>San Diego Zoo</LOCATION> had
to be killed because of injuries she suffered after falling
headfirst into a concrete moat, officials said.
   Maya, an Asian elephant who was the oldest mammal at the zoo,
apparently suffered torn ligaments in her legs <DATE>Sunday</DATE> as she tried
to climb out of the moat surrounding her enclosure, said zoo
spokesman <PERSON>Jeff Jouett</PERSON>.
   Veterinarians resorted to a fatal dose of sedative when Maya was
unable to stand on her own following a treatment of fluids,
painkillers and steroids.
   ``I counted 27 people there trying to help,'' <PERSON>Jouett</PERSON> said.
``When she would try to rock and stand up, there was a lot of
calling and urging to her.''
   Elephants cannot convalesce while sitting or lying down because
their weight exerts life-threatening pressure on their lungs,
<PERSON>Jouett</PERSON> said.
   <PERSON>Jouett</PERSON> said 51 is fairly elderly for an elephant, but they have
been known to live into their 60s in captivity.
   Maya, who was captured in <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and brought to the zoo <DATE>Nov. 8,
1941</DATE>, was bumped into the moat by another elephant. Two nearby
keepers didn't see the <DATE>fall</DATE> but heard the commotion.
   The 7,100-pound elephant was walking without difficulty in the
moat, but she apparently crippled herself while trying to climb out
on bales of hay that zookeepers set up like steps, <PERSON>Jouett</PERSON> said.
   Maya then was fitted with a harness and lifted by crane into a
sitting position. But it was evident when workers tried to get her
to stand that her legs wouldn't support her, and she was then put
to death.
   Elephants have been knocked into the moat before without
suffering serious injury, but <PERSON>Jouett</PERSON> said <PERSON>Maya</PERSON>'s age may have made
her accident worse. Tests after her death showed she suffered from
degenerative arthritis in her legs.
   He described her as a generally calm, easygoing creature, but
one who often would assert herself to show she still led the herd.
   ``There's some concern over how the remaining four elephants
will react,'' <PERSON>Jouett</PERSON> said. ``They'll notice she's gone and I'm sure
it will be upsetting to them.''
   After the accident, the zoo's <LOCATION>Elephant Mesa</LOCATION> was closed to the
public for the rest of the day.

He added, "Right now, we're just stunned. It's a sad, sad day.";    The <LOCATION>San

 <PERSON>Jouett</PERSON> said another keeper at the park's elephant yard, Dusty Janeke, heard
the commotion of the two elephants fighting, went to investigate and found
<PERSON>Orsi</PERSON> on the ground.;    "She apparently stepped in to break up a fight,"
<PERSON>Jouett</PERSON> said. "Fights are a fairly frequent part of elephant life. They fight
to establish position in the pecking order of the herd.;    "When the fighting
gets particularly violent, the keeper's job is to intervene to keep the
elephants from injuring each other, and it's highly likely she was trying to
protect one of the elephants from being injured by the other.";    The two
elephants involved, females named <PERSON>Alice</PERSON> and Cha-Cha, were herded into the

BABY ELEPHANT OFF TO SHAKY START; 
</P>
<P>
SURVIVAL: WILD ANIMAL PARK OFFICIALS WORRY ABOUT SURVIVAL OF NEWBORN ASIAN 
ELEPHANT AFTER HIS MOTHER REJECTS HIM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A newborn Asian elephant at the <LOCATION>San Diego Wild Animal Park</LOCATION> had to be separated 
from his mother shortly after birth <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, leading keepers to worry whether 
the valuable young pachyderm will survive. 
</P>
<P>
"The calf bellowed and scared the mom, and so Mom began to kick, stomp and try 
to kill the baby," said <PERSON>Tom Hanscom</PERSON>, a spokesman for the park. "At that point, 
the keepers physically placed themselves between Mom and the baby." 
</P>
<P>
Hanscom, who witnessed the event, said it was "miraculous" that no one was 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
"For a while it was all a jumble of keepers and elephants, and she did strike 
out and hit the keepers," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The attack occurred shortly after veterinarians cleared Omar the calf's lungs 
of fluid and reunited the elephants, <PERSON>Hanscom</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
The park has tried since <DATE>1984</DATE> to establish an Asian elephant breeding program, 
but has been unsuccessful. Three fetuses have been stillborn at the park in 
recent years, so officials are willing to take extraordinary measures to save 
Omar, the first to make it out of the womb alive. 
</P>
<P>
The park now has eight Asian elephants, <PERSON>Hanscom</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
A healthy male Asian elephant is worth <MONEY>$20,000</MONEY> to <MONEY>$30,000</MONEY>, said <PERSON>Mike Keele</PERSON>, 
assistant curator at the <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> Park Zoo in <LOCATION>Portland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ore</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-four Asian elephants have been born in the <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> zoo since <DATE>1962</DATE>, 
making it the most successful such program in the country, <PERSON>Keele</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
Raising elephants is difficult "primarily because of the bull elephant's 
enormous size and power," he said. "There are not that many facilities in the 
country that can house a bull. . . . They are capable of tearing down a 
building." 
</P>
<P>
It is also difficult to get them to breed because they need a free-roaming, 
"herd feeling," <PERSON>Keele</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
More emphasis has been placed on raising Asian elephants than African elephants 
because Asians are fewer, but both are in danger of extinction, he said. A team 
of at least five keepers and veterinarians are monitoring the infant and 
17-year-old mother, <ORGANIZATION>Connie</ORGANIZATION>, around the clock "until the situation changes 
drastically," <PERSON>Hanscom</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
It is unsafe for the 265-pound calf to suckle from his mother, and zoo 
officials cannot milk enough from Connie themselves to ensure his survival, 
<PERSON>Hanscom</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
Getting milk to the calf is crucial because it contains ingredients that 
develop the youngster's immune system, but park officials are taking it slowly. 
The pair are being reunited every four hours for short periods to try to get 
Connie to accept her son. 
</P>
<P>
"We are still concerned that she might repeat this aggression," <PERSON>Hanscom</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
During the get-acquainted sessions, <ORGANIZATION>Connie</ORGANIZATION> is bound with leg chains and <ORGANIZATION>Omar</ORGANIZATION> is 
on a leash. The restraints are necessary for the safety of the elephants and 
park officials, <PERSON>Hanscom</PERSON> said.

ZOO ELEPHANT'S DEATH STIRS FUROR; 
</P>
<P>
ANIMALS: HUMANE SOCIETY CRITICIZES SAN DIEGO ZOO OVER ITS 'EXTREMELY DANGEROUS' 
PACHYDERM EXHIBIT. BUT OFFICIALS SCOFF AT HIS STATEMENTS. 
</P>

<P>
Investigators at the <ORGANIZATION>Humane Society</ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> sent a letter 
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE> to the <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> Zoo charging that its elephant exhibit is inadequate 
and "extremely dangerous" for both the huge mammals and their keepers. 
</P>
<P>
The letter to <PERSON>Doug Meyers</PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION>San Diego Zoological Society</ORGANIZATION>, was 
prompted by the death <DATE>Sunday</DATE> of <ORGANIZATION>Maya</ORGANIZATION>, a 51-year-old Asian elephant that was put 
to death after she fell into a moat and crippled herself. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not question the care Maya received after her tragic fall into the moat, 
nor the fact that euthanasia was the humane decision to make on her behalf," 
wrote <PERSON>David K. Wills</PERSON>, a vice president in the <ORGANIZATION>Humane Society's Department of 
Investigations</ORGANIZATION>. "However, we are concerned as to what steps zoo officials are 
going to take to improve conditions for the surviving elephants." 
</P>
<P>
Wills criticized the exhibit for its uninsulated floors and its lack of heat 
inside the barn, its limited outdoor shelter and its daily reliance upon chains 
to restrain the elephants. In addition, he charged that a catwalk that connects 
two areas of the elephant yard is precariously narrow, and he called for it to 
be widened. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Jeff Jouett</PERSON>, a spokesman for the zoo, acknowledged that the nearly 30-year-old 
elephant yard is "not perfect," but he said the zoo is in the midst of making 
improvements. So far, they have planted shade trees, he said, and replaced 
decaying floor boards with cement. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Jouett</PERSON> said the zoo also plans to widen the catwalk. But he rejected Wills' 
claim that "if the catwalk were widened, <ORGANIZATION>Maya</ORGANIZATION> might still be alive today," 
saying that while no one witnessed her fall, her placement in the moat 
indicated she did not fall off the walkway. Jouett also dismissed Wills' 
assertion that the exhibit, which now houses one African and three Asian 
elephants, is "grossly inadequate." 
</P>
<P>
"It has passed <ORGANIZATION>USDA</ORGANIZATION> inspections, and we'll welcome the <ORGANIZATION>USDA</ORGANIZATION> to come look at it 
again," <PERSON>Jouett</PERSON> said, noting that <ORGANIZATION>Wills</ORGANIZATION> has asked the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Department of 
Agriculture</ORGANIZATION> to investigate the exhibit. He called most of Wills' allegations 
"just exaggerations to catch the public's attention. It makes nice quotes but 
it's just not true." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Dr. Homer Malaby</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>USDA</ORGANIZATION> animal care specialist in <LOCATION>Sacramento</LOCATION>, said he will 
visit the zoo next week to investigate the <ORGANIZATION>Humane Society</ORGANIZATION>'s allegations. Of 
particular interest, he said, was their charge that the animals have no way to 
escape the rain during the day because they are locked out of their barn. 
</P>
<P>
"If the only shelter the animals have from inclement weather is their indoor 
housing facility, and if they're put out every morning and not allowed back in, 
no matter what the weather, then yes, that would be a violation of the Animal 
Welfare Act," <PERSON>Malaby</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
But <PERSON>Jouett</PERSON> said that the barn door is always opened when it rains. 
</P>
<P>
"They only need walk into the barn," he said, characterizing Wills' letter as 
an attempt to drum up negative publicity. "It's the animal ambulance chaser 
syndrome -- take a tragedy and use it to get your name in the paper." 
</P>
<P>
Wills' letter asserts that nearly half of the zoos approved by the <ORGANIZATION>American 
Assn. of Zoological Parks</ORGANIZATION> and Aquariums have abandoned the practice of chaining 
elephants at night. 
</P>
<P>
But <PERSON>Jouett</PERSON> said he was "sure" that was an overstatement -- he has only heard of 
a handful of zoos that don't use chains. In the winter months, he said, the <LOCATION>San 
Diego</LOCATION> Zoo chains its elephants for 16 hours a day, while the rest of the year 
the animals are chained for about 12 hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
"They're chained for the protection of the elephants and the people to make 
sure they don't steal each others' food and to maintain the safety of the 
keepers," <PERSON>Jouett</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
Jouett called Wills' contention that the elephant barn should be heated 
"intentional misrepresentation." 
</P>
<P>
"The temperature in the elephant barn is not cold," he said. Even during the 
recent frigid weather, he said, when the barn is closed at night "a person 
could walk in there and break a sweat. We have four huge animals that are like 
furnaces -- four huge masses of body heat. Elephants have a problem staying 
cool, not staying warm. It's not a concern."

Animal and <ORGANIZATION>Plant Health Inspection Service</ORGANIZATION> (APHIS) show "repeated disciplinary 
measures" on <DATE>Feb. 17 and 18, 1988</DATE>, to the 18-year-old female African elephant 
"did cause bruising and damage to the skin on the elephant's head and signs of 
behavioral stress." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>James W. Glosser</PERSON>, the administrator of <ORGANIZATION>APHIS</ORGANIZATION>, reminded the <ORGANIZATION>Zoological Society</ORGANIZATION> 
of federal law regarding animal treatment. "Handling of animals shall be done 
as expeditiously and carefully in a way so as not to cause unnecessary 
discomfort, behavioral stress, or physical harm to the animal," <PERSON>Glosser</PERSON> wrote. 
"Care should be exercised also to avoid harm to the handler." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Glosser</PERSON> said that while zoos obviously require animal control and discipline to 
assure both the safety of animals and the public, "We must warn you that any 
further documented use of such excessive disciplinary measures (as occurred 
with Dunda) may result in legal action to secure compliance" with federal laws. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Zoological Society</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>Jeff Jouett</PERSON> said <DATE>Monday</DATE> that its officials 
disagree with the letter's conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
"We stand by our own investigation and the investigations by the <ORGANIZATION>San Diego 
Humane Society</ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> city attorney, and the <ORGANIZATION>American Assn. of 
Zoological Parks</ORGANIZATION> and Aquariums, which found that <ORGANIZATION>Dunda</ORGANIZATION>'s short disciplinary 
training sessions were not excessive and did not cause unnecessary discomfort," 
<PERSON>Jouett</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Jouett</PERSON> said that <ORGANIZATION>USDA</ORGANIZATION> inspectors lack expertise in handling exotic, or zoo 
animals, because their usual experience has been in dealing with domesticated 
animals. 
</P>
<P>
"We are willing to work closely with the <ORGANIZATION>USDA</ORGANIZATION> to develop elephant-training 
guidelines that are beneficial for elephants, and to allow their keepers to 
work safely," <PERSON>Jouett</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sessions Criticized as Brutal 
</P>
<P>
Zoo officials maintain that the discipline, which included chaining <ORGANIZATION>Dunda</ORGANIZATION>'s 
legs, pulling her to the ground, and beating her on the head with ax handles 
for short periods, was necessary to train Dunda not to lash out and try to 
injure her keepers. The incident occurred shortly after <PERSON>Dunda</PERSON> was transferred 
to the Wild Animal Park from the <LOCATION>San Diego Zoo</LOCATION>, where she had spent most of her 
life. 
</P>
<P>
Several of <ORGANIZATION>Dunda</ORGANIZATION>'s former keepers at the zoo criticized the sessions as 
unnecessary and brutal, but the numerous subsequent investigations produced 
conflicting conclusions. While the <ORGANIZATION>San Diego Humane Society</ORGANIZATION> and city attorney's 
office concluded that there was insufficient evidence to prosecute anyone on 
animal cruelty charges, the <ORGANIZATION>Humane Society</ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> called the 
incident a clear case of abuse. 
</P>
<P>
The incident raised questions of how elephant discipline is handled at zoos 
around the world and whether changes need to be considered. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. <PERSON>Dan McCorquodale</PERSON> (D-San Jose), who took an active interest in the case and 
has introduced legislation to ban zoo elephant rides and limit types of 
discipline, said <DATE>Monday</DATE> he was pleased at the <ORGANIZATION>USDA</ORGANIZATION> letter. 
</P>
<P>
"The people who are on the outside and unrelated to the city and zoo have said 
there was excessive force used, and those that have close ties (to the zoo) 
have tried to smooth the issue over, so I'm satisfied with what the (<ORGANIZATION>USDA</ORGANIZATION>) did 
and it did give a good strong warning and said clearly it will be watching 
things in the future," <PERSON>McCorquodale</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Prohibitions Under Legislation 
</P>
<P>
His legislation, on which a public hearing will be held in the state <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> 
later this month, would prohibit elephant discipline that involved use of 
electricity, deprivation of food, water or rest, or any action that results in 
damages, scars or breaks in the skin. It would also prohibit insertion of any 
instrument into an animal's bodily orifices. 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, the zoo will look back on this in hindsight and say that what was 
done was not a good thing and go on and try to rebuild its image as it existed 
in the past," <PERSON>McCorquodale</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Jouett</PERSON> said that the zoo, while it disagrees with the <ORGANIZATION>USDA</ORGANIZATION> and will so respond, 
"is onto other things" as well. 
</P>
<P>
"There are two elephants now pregnant, three others are suspected of being 
pregnant, and we expect an elephant birth in <DATE>August</DATE>," <PERSON>Jouett</PERSON> said. Dunda is not 
yet ready for a mate, however, because she needs more time to be fully accepted 
into the Wild Animal Park herd, he said.

<HEAD>Asian Elephant Dies During Surgery After Caesarean Section</HEAD>
<NOTE>By DAVID SEDENO</NOTE>
<NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Asian elephant who earlier underwent an
unprecedented Caesarean section died during emergency surgery at
the <LOCATION>San Diego Wild Animal Park</LOCATION>.
   A team of veterinarians worked on Jean, the 19-year-old,
7,000-pound elephant, for about three hours <DATE>Friday</DATE> in hopes of
alleviating complications caused by the death of the fetus in her
womb. But in the end there was nothing they could do to save her,
park spokesman <PERSON>Tom Hanscom</PERSON> said.
   The elephant was destroyed with a fatal dose of anesthetic while
still unconscious for the surgery, he said.
   Jean had been fighting a severe abdominal infection caused by
the dead 300-pound fetus, which was removed <DATE>Nov. 20</DATE> during the
first Caesarean section known to have been performed on an elephant.
   After the infection started, veterinarians fed Jean
intravenously and gave her antibiotics and pain killers, but her
condition did not improve and veterinarians operated again <DATE>Friday</DATE>
<TIME>night</TIME> in a last-ditch attempt to save the pachyderm's life.
   ``Veterinarians attempted to repair the uterus. They were unable
to do so. They also attempted to do a hysterectomy but were unable
to do that because of its size and inaccessibility,'' <PERSON>Hanscom</PERSON> said.
   Jean had made the record books after being pregnant for more
than 730 days, surpassing the pregnancy of an Asian elephant that
gave birth at a zoo in <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> after 720 days. The normal gestation
period for the Asian elephant is between 618 and 648 days.
   ``If there is any positive sign to the ordeal, in our attempt to
save her life we have gained a tremendous amount of knowledge that
we can hopefully apply to the care of other elephants,'' <PERSON>Hanscom</PERSON>
said.

BILL WOULD BAN ZOO ELEPHANT RIDES, LIMIT DISCIPLINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE FRITSCH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Legislation that would ban elephant rides at zoos, circuses and carnivals is 
being prepared at the request of <PERSON>Sen. Dan McCorquodale</PERSON> (D-San Jose), chairman 
of the <ORGANIZATION>Senate Natural Resources Committee</ORGANIZATION>, as part of a comprehensive bill 
dealing with the handling of captive elephants. 
</P>
<P>
The ban, believed to be the first in the country, will be considered <DATE>March 9</DATE> at 
a meeting of a task force formed by <ORGANIZATION>McCorquodale</ORGANIZATION> after an elephant-beating 
incident at the <LOCATION>San Diego Wild Animal Park</LOCATION> <DATE>last year</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>McCorquodale</PERSON> also has asked the legislative counsel to draft language that 
would make it illegal to discipline an elephant by using electricity, depriving 
it of food, water or rest, or in any way that damages, scars or breaks its 
skin. The bill also would make it a violation of the Penal Code to discipline 
an elephant by inserting any instrument into any bodily orifice, according to a 
letter <PERSON>McCorquodale</PERSON> sent to <ORGANIZATION>Legislative Counsel Bion Gregory</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
McCorquodale plans to introduce the legislation some time this year, but it is 
unclear whether the final version will include the ban on rides, according to 
an aide to <PERSON>McCorquodale</PERSON> who asked not to be named. The aide called the proposed 
ban "very preliminary." The task force, an advisory group that includes zoo 
officials and animal rights activists, will be asked for comment on the bill at 
the meeting in <LOCATION>Sacramento</LOCATION> next week. 
</P>
<P>
Strong opposition from zoos throughout the state is expected. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't think of any other spot in the world where it's against the law to 
ride elephants," said <PERSON>Jeff Jouett</PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION>Zoological Society</ORGANIZATION> of 
<LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>, said <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>. "Elephant rides are one of the most popular 
attractions. They're a rare opportunity for people to come into contact and 
appreciate the animals in a very special way. Rides are a part of elephant 
history and something that has happened for thousands of years." 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION> zoos may coordinate a protest of the proposed ban for presentation 
at the task force meeting, <PERSON>Jouett</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Big Money Maker 
</P>
<P>
Last year, 156,912 elephant rides were given at the <LOCATION>San Diego Zoo</LOCATION> by a private 
contractor, netting the zoo <MONEY>$80,020</MONEY>, <PERSON>Jouett</PERSON> said. The Wild Animal Park, which 
uses its own elephants, gave 60,571 elephant rides in <DATE>1988</DATE>, bringing in 
<MONEY>$106,000</MONEY>, he said. The <ORGANIZATION>Zoological Society</ORGANIZATION> operates both the park and the zoo. 
</P>
<P>
Elephant rides also are "extremely popular" at the <LOCATION>Los Angeles Zoo</LOCATION>, according 
to <PERSON>Ed Alonso</PERSON>, animal collection curator there. The rides "give another 
dimension to the public understanding of elephants," <PERSON>Alonso</PERSON> said. "They've been 
domesticated for a number of years." 
</P>
<P>
The push for the ban on elephant rides comes from animal rights advocates on 
the task force who allege that excessive discipline is required to make 
elephants docile enough to safely carry children. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing I have against (rides) is they're the first step toward making 
elephants circus animals in the zoo," said <PERSON>Cleveland Amory</PERSON>, head of the New 
York-based Fund for Animals and a member of <ORGANIZATION>McCorquodale</ORGANIZATION>'s task force. "We have 
to stop all these stupid tricks and standing on drums." 
</P>
<P>
Elephants are so "brow-beaten" in the process of training for rides, <PERSON>Amory</PERSON> 
said, "that, by the time it's over, they're not elephants any more, they're 
large zombies." 
</P>
<P>
"They say they have to beat them to protect the keepers, well they have to beat 
them all the harder to protect the public," <PERSON>Amory</PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Zoo Experts Believe Kidney Failure Caused Elephant's Death</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kidney failure was suspected in the death
of an elephant whose calf was stillborn in a Caesarian section last
month, zookeepers said <DATE>Sunday</DATE>.
   Babe, a 36-year-old Asian elephant, died <DATE>Saturday</DATE> at Burnet Park
Zoo. The 7,700-pound elephant was taken to <ORGANIZATION>Cornell University</ORGANIZATION>'s
veterinary school, where an autopsy continued <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, said <PERSON>Don
Moore</PERSON>, the zoo's curator of mammals.
   Final autopsy results won't be available for a week to 10 days,
though veterinarians may have preliminary lab results by <DATE>Monday</DATE>,
<PERSON>Moore</PERSON> said.
   Babe's death has prompted criticism from animal rights activists
angry over the zoo's breeding program. Burnet Park is small by zoo
standards but has an ambitious breeding program.
   ``May God grant her the peace that man never did,'' said <PERSON>Joyce
Goike</PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION>Central New York Humane Association</ORGANIZATION>. On
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE> she asked the zoo to put Babe to sleep rather than
prolong the elephant's suffering.
   Babe's 22-month pregnancy drew worldwide attention from
zookeepers trying to breed endangered Asian elephants in captivity.
   Had the pregnancy been successful, Babe would have been the
oldest elephant to become a first-time mother in a North American
zoo. But after a stalled labor, Babe underwent a Caesarian section
<DATE>April 23</DATE>. Her 266-pound bull calf died in the womb when it could
not position itself properly for birth.
   No elephant has ever recovered after a Caesarian section,
zookeepers said.
   Right up to the time of Babe's death, zookeepers were hopeful
she would recover. A day earlier, Babe had been taken off the
critical list and upgraded to stable condition.
   <PERSON>Moore</PERSON>, who helped on the autopsy, said Babe's ``kidneys didn't
look too good'' and that kidney failure probably caused her death.
   <PERSON>Gary MacLachlan</PERSON>, who heads the <LOCATION>Onondaga County</LOCATION> parks agency that
runs the zoo, said Babe's death will raise questions about the
zoo's decision to breed her. ``This may add fuel to any skepticism
people have had,'' he said.
   Animal rights activists complain about the mortality rate of
newborns at the zoo. Of about 300 mammals born there last year, 59
died.
   The zoo's breeding program will continue despite Babe's death,
said County Executive <PERSON>Nicholas Pirro</PERSON>. A second Asian elephant at
the zoo is expected to give birth in <DATE>July 1991</DATE>.
   ``Nothing that has happened will stop us from what the zoo
people believe, and I agree, is the best we can do to preserve this
species,'' <PERSON>Pirro</PERSON> said.
   An Asian elephant expert agreed that Burnet Park should continue
its breeding program.
   ``They're certainly not guilty of anything except incredibly bad
luck,'' said <PERSON>Roger Henneous</PERSON>, senior elephant keeper at the
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> Park Zoo in <LOCATION>Portland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ore</LOCATION>. The <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> Park Zoo, the
nation's premier Asian elephant breeder, has had 24 births in the
past 28 years.
   Only 62 Asian elephants have been born in captivity. The species
numbers fewer than 45,000 in the wild.

injuries after being knocked to the ground during the fight between Asian
elephants named <PERSON>Alice</PERSON> and Cha-Cha.;    Park spokesman <PERSON>Tom Hanscom</PERSON> said the
accident was witnessed by four park visitors who said one elephant charged the

she may have tried to intervene to break up the fight between the elephants.
But <PERSON>Hanscom</PERSON> said that, based on the witness accounts, it appeared she did not
have a chance to react and literally was caught between the two battling
elephants.;    <ORGANIZATION>Hanscom</ORGANIZATION> cautioned it was too early to say exactly what
happened. He said the park has indefinitely suspended its elephant shows and
public feedings of the animals. He added that park officials were reviewing
policies and procedures regarding the handling of elephants.;    No
disciplinary or isolation measures are planned against the animals involved.
Hanscom said it is common for elephants to physically challenge each other to
establish a social order within the herd.;    There are nine Asian elephants
at the park.;    The death of <PERSON>Orsi</PERSON> was the first animal-caused fatality at the

Discipline exceeding acceptable levels was applied by <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> Wild Animal 
Park keepers to Dunda the elephant in <DATE>February, 1988</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Department of 
Agriculture</ORGANIZATION> has concluded in a letter of warning to the <ORGANIZATION>Zoological Society</ORGANIZATION> of 
<LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>.

<P>
The <DATE>April 6</DATE> letter said that results of an investigation by the department's

   <PERSON>Cynthia Moss</PERSON> left <ORGANIZATION>Newsweek</ORGANIZATION> in the late <DATE>1960s</DATE> for a vacation in the game parks of <LOCATION>East Africa</LOCATION>. 
She was hooked for life and settled over there permanently in <DATE>1968</DATE>, eventually embarking on a 14-year study of the free-ranging elephants in <LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Amboseli Park</LOCATION>. 
For much of that time she lived in a tent with a view of <ORGANIZATION>Mt. Kilimanjaro</ORGANIZATION>. 
Although she was not a biologist when she arrived, she was a quick study and has published many articles in professional journals about every aspect of elephant life and death, based on a unique backlog of experience in the field. 

   In "Elephant Memories: Thirteen Years in the Life of an Elephant Family" (<ORGANIZATION>Morrow</ORGANIZATION>, 336 pages, <MONEY>$22.95</MONEY>), <PERSON>Ms. Moss</PERSON> speaks to the general reader, with charm as well as scientific authority. 
In the end, her elegantly written and ingeniously structured account makes a powerful argument for the preservation of elephants from poachers who supply ivory to Japanese carvers and from legal marksmen hired to "cull" park herds and thereby save trees from being devoured. 

   She was helped along by the African Wildlife Fund, the <ORGANIZATION>New York Zoological Society</ORGANIZATION> and various individuals. 
Her main tool of research was an aged Land Rover that took her safely among the big beasts. 
For all the years she went out day after day looking for elephants, her most basic and valuable activity was the one she began on the first day. 
It amounted to taking attendance. 
Having given every one of several hundred elephants an individual name and memorized their appearances from observation and from studying photographs systematically shot for identification purposes, she was then in a position to "know" a large wild population. 
And by the time you get even a short way into <PERSON>Ms. Moss</PERSON>'s book, so will you. 

   Drawing on hundreds and hundreds of days of meticulous observation, <PERSON>Ms. Moss</PERSON> introduces her discussions of one subject or another with true stories built on real experience. 
Sometimes the narrative is clearly straight firsthand reportage. 
Other times it is a composite rendering or an imaginative reconstruction. 

   It is hard to see how any fair-minded person could object to these graceful vignettes. 
People with a strong aversion to anthropomorphic writing about animals will, however, find some passages to object to here. 
<PERSON>Ms. Moss</PERSON> is not shy about claiming to know what is in the minds of elephants at various times. 
On the other hand, many of her inferences do seem reasonable. 
For example, she concludes that an orphaned elephant calf is mourning his mother when he strokes her dismembered jaw, having come upon it in <PERSON>Ms. Moss</PERSON>'s camp where she was studying it several weeks after the death. 

   Some of these anthropomorphic passages serve mainly to show something quite interesting about the mentality of a sensitive animal researcher. 
When she describes the death of the matriarch <PERSON>Teresia</PERSON>, from infected Maasai spear wounds, <PERSON>Ms. Moss</PERSON> imagines what the semiconscious elephant is thinking: "She had reached a state of feeling little and she mostly dreamed, perhaps of vast swards of sweet new grass and clear, cool hill streams. 
Or the taste and feel of the sweet juices that squirted out when she crunched down on her favorite wild fruit. 
Or most likely the smell and touch and sounds of her family -- those who were still alive and others who were long gone, her grandmother, mother, sisters and brothers, sons and daughters." 

   That's not merely an affecting passage, one which brings a sad tale of killing to an end, it is a window into the mind of <PERSON>Ms. Moss</PERSON> and it shows the sort of imaginative sympathy that drove her forward for 14 years and helped her define and solve formal problems of elephant behavior. 
By thinking herself as best she could into the processes of elephant "thought," using what she knew scientifically and intuitively about the animal she knew best -- herself -- she was able to position herself fruitfully in the park and to hypothesize effectively. 
If she had not been interested, as a woman, in motherhood and female sexuality, would <PERSON>Ms. Moss</PERSON> have been such a successful documenter of the patterns of movement and sociability that can be lumped together as an objective proof that elephant families are a functioning, self-conscious matriarchy? 
If she had not been struck, as a woman, by the grotesque exudations streaming from the temporal glands and four-foot, S-shaped penises of certain adult male elephants, would she have been led to identify this "disease" as musth, the sexual frenzy of male estrus never before documented in African elephants? 
The whole wild mess of musth never did appeal to her. 
"Personally," she writes, "I cannot imagine why Tia wanted to mate with Bad Bull, but then she may have seen something in him that I did not." 

   This is a passionate book written for the most part with scientific restraint. 
<PERSON>Ms. Moss</PERSON> cares deeply about educating the rest of us, but she also wants to communicate the orderly excitement of field research and of entering into elephant life. 
By drawing us in, she hopes to recruit all of us to her cause, which is the elephant's. 
In a brief call to arms at the end of this splendid addition to the literature of natural history, <PERSON>Ms. Moss</PERSON> permits herself a plea from the heart: "In the <DATE>last two years</DATE> I have realized that more than anything else, more than scientific discoveries or acceptance, what I care about and what I will fight for is the conservation, for as long as possible, not of just a certain number of elephants, but of the whole way of life of elephants."

BATTLE INTENSIFIES OVER ZOO'S ELEPHANT EXHIBIT; 
</P>
<P>
ANIMAL CARE: HUMANE SOCIETY ATTACKS CREDIBILITY OF PARK'S SPOKESMAN, WHO DENIES 
ENCLOSURE IS INADEQUATE FOLLOWING THE DEATH OF A 51-YEAR-OLD MAMMAL. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In the latest tit-for-tat exchange with the <LOCATION>San Diego Zoo</LOCATION>, investigators at the 
<ORGANIZATION>Humane Society</ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> on <DATE>Friday</DATE> attacked the credibility of the 
zoo's spokesman and restated their belief that the elephant exhibit is badly in 
need of repairs. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no nice way to put this," <PERSON>David K. Wills</PERSON>, a vice president in the 
<ORGANIZATION>Humane Society's Department of Investigations</ORGANIZATION>, said in a press release 
rebutting several published statements made by <PERSON>Jeff Jouett</PERSON>, the zoo's 
spokesman. "He's just not telling the truth." 
</P>
<P>
To support that claim, Wills provided documents that appear to show that top 
zoo officials sought in <DATE>1984</DATE> to widen a narrow cat walk and in <DATE>1985</DATE> assessed 
how much it would cost to install heaters in the elephant barn. As yet, neither 
improvement has been made, and <PERSON>Jouett</PERSON> has said that heaters are unnecessary 
because the elephants' body heat is furnace-like. 
</P>
<P>
Wills and <PERSON>Jouett</PERSON> have been trading charges in the press since <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, when 
The Times reported that the Humane Society was seeking an investigation of the 
exhibit after the death of <ORGANIZATION>Maya</ORGANIZATION>, a 51-year-old Asian elephant that was 
euthanized after she fell into a moat and injured herself. Wills charged that 
<ORGANIZATION>Maya</ORGANIZATION>'s death proved that the elephant enclosure is "grossly inadequate." 
</P>
<P>
But, on <DATE>Friday</DATE>, <PERSON>Jouett</PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION>Wills</ORGANIZATION>' allegations stemmed solely from "a 
disgruntled employee who now makes a profession out of zoo-bashing" -- a 
reference to <PERSON>Lisa Landres</PERSON>, a former elephant keeper at the <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> Zoo who is 
now a <ORGANIZATION>Humane Society</ORGANIZATION> investigator based in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>. Landres resigned in <DATE>1989</DATE> 
because, she said, the zoo was punishing her for being outspoken about the 
beating of the elephant Dunda. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Jouett</PERSON>, who has acknowledged that the elephant exhibit is "not perfect," said 
that, by necessity, repairs at the 100-acre zoo must be done in order of 
priority. Although the zoo plans to widen the cat walk eventually, he said, it 
is not an urgent need. 
</P>
<P>
"If there's an immediate concern for animal health or safety or human health or 
safety, then it rises to the top of the priority list," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Wills, meanwhile, provided a copy of an internal zoo memo, dated <DATE>Aug. 9, 1984</DATE>, 
in which zoo officials listed, in order of priority, what they called 
"modifications requirements" in the elephant mesa. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Alan Roocroft</PERSON>, the elephant supervisor for the zoo and Wild Animal Park, said 
the first priority was improved access for heavy-duty vehicles -- an 
improvement that <PERSON>Jouett</PERSON> said has since been completed. The second priority, in 
a list of six, suggested replacing a large pool with a smaller one in order to 
accommodate wider walkways. 
</P>
<P>
"Currently it is not possible for more than one animal to safely negotiate its 
way around the pool," <PERSON>Roocroft</PERSON>'s memo said. "In addition, the space is so 
narrow that the possibility always exists that an animal might lose its footing 
and tumble into the moat." 
</P>
<P>
Another memo a month later estimated that it would cost <MONEY>$4,000</MONEY> to make those 
changes to the pool and cat walk. 
</P>
<P>
When asked whether <PERSON>Roocroft</PERSON>'s safety concerns would classify the 
walkway-widening project as urgent, <PERSON>Jouett</PERSON> said no. He said that, although no 
one witnessed <ORGANIZATION>Maya</ORGANIZATION>'s fall on <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, he believes she did not fall off the cat 
walk. 
</P>
<P>
"An elephant can be bumped into the moat from any point in the exhibit, whether 
on the cat walk or not," he said. In response to the memo, he said: "It doesn't 
say the elephants were at risk if they were walking in single file. It doesn't 
say that one animal is in danger. Yesterday I saw two elephants there -- they 
walked the whole length and lived to tell about it." 
</P>
<P>
But <PERSON>Steve Friedlund</PERSON>, an elephant keeper who was the first to rush to <ORGANIZATION>Maya</ORGANIZATION>'s aid 
after she fell, said that it is "almost an absolute sure bet" that <ORGANIZATION>Maya</ORGANIZATION> fell 
from the cat walk. When Friedlund found the elephant, her back legs were in the 
moat and her front elbows were resting on the cat walk, indicating that she had 
fallen head-first from the walk and was trying to right herself. 
</P>
<P>
"The walkway is a death trap," said <PERSON>Friedlund</PERSON>, who estimated the cat walk is 2 
1/2 feet wide. "The zoo has known the problem for a long time. They're 
defending their Disneyland image that everything is safe and sound here. It's 
time to get on with the business of solving the problem." 
</P>
<P>
Another inter-office memo provided by <ORGANIZATION>Wills</ORGANIZATION> estimates the cost of installing 
elephant barn floor heating. In the <DATE>September, 1985</DATE> memo, <PERSON>Hella Winter</PERSON>, a 
project coordinator in the zoo's architecture and design department, estimated 
that it would cost <MONEY>$15,000</MONEY> to install a 12-foot-wide heated strip in the 
concrete floor that would run the full length of the barn. 
</P>
<P>
The memo was addressed to Friedlund, <PERSON>Carmi G. Penny</PERSON>, the zoo's curator of 
mammals, and another animal care specialist who has since left the zoo. At the 
bottom, <DATE>Winter</DATE> has written: "Please call us &amp; let's decide ASAP what to 
do!" 
</P>
<P>
According to <LOCATION>Wills</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Winter</ORGANIZATION>'s memo came in response to keeper documentation of 
frigid temperatures -- 40 degrees and lower -- in the elephant barn at night. 
</P>
<P>
"Without heating in the floor, the concrete draws the body heat away from the 
elephants when they lie down," Wills' press release asserts, adding that the 
keepers recorded the cold temperatures when there were seven elephants in the 
barn. "With only four left, <PERSON>Mr. Jouett</PERSON>'s idea that they are 'furnaces' loses 
even more credibility." 
</P>
<P>
Jouett responded that he had heard that <PERSON>Landres</PERSON> and Friedlund measured the 
temperatures in a zoo office, not in the barn, "in an attempt to prove their 
point." 
</P>
<P>
Friedlund countered that in fact, <PERSON>Curby Simerson</PERSON>, the zoo's assistant animal 
care manager, was the person who held the thermometer in the barn. It read 34 
degrees, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But <PERSON>Jouett</PERSON> said that was impossible. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not 40 degrees in the barn with the elephants," he said. "Consider the 
source. . . . Two years gone and 3,000 miles away, <PERSON>Lisa</PERSON> (<PERSON>Landres</PERSON>) is still 
trying to push through her pet projects, and she's using (The Times) to do 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Reached in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> on <DATE>Friday</DATE>, <PERSON>Landres</PERSON> said, "That's just a lie. You wouldn't 
believe how cold it is in there. Whether I worked there or not, why don't they 
focus their energy on making the place better?" 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Sally Mackler</PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the animal rights group <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> Animal 
Advocates, echoed those sentiments. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a poor excuse and an easy out to blame a 'disgruntled employee,' " 
<PERSON>Mackler</PERSON> said in a statement. "We should take a closer look at why <PERSON>Lisa Landres</PERSON> 
was dissatisfied with zoo policies and methods regarding the elephants' care." 
</P>
<P>
Wills also contested <PERSON>Jouett</PERSON>'s claim that the elephants may take shelter in 
their barn during inclement daytime weather. 
</P>
<P>
"The elephant barn has not been made available to the elephants as a shelter 
from the rain, except in rare, isolated instances when past keeper staff let 
the elephants indoors due to extreme cold or wind," Wills wrote. "With this 
documentation in hand, you may join with us in realizing that it's difficult to 
know what to believe when the <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> Zoo responds to criticism." 
</P>
<P>
Jouett responded: "In a hard, cold rain, the doors are opened. If it's a warm 
day or a light shower, and they're showing no ill effects, the doors probably 
won't be open. For an elephant, that's not inclement weather." 
</P>
<P>
He added, "What happens if it rains in <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> or <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION>? Do the elephants run in 
the barn then? The elephants like the rain."

<HEAD>Tacoma Zoo Needs More Room for Elephants</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TACOMA, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The elephants of Point Defiance Zoo are
getting bigger homes at a <MONEY>$1.5 million</MONEY> cost, improvements
necessitated largely by a profoundly problematic pachyderm named
<PERSON>Cindy</PERSON>, the zoo director says.
   Cindy, a 24-year-old from <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION>, is returning after six years on
loan to the <LOCATION>San Diego Wild Animal Park</LOCATION>. In fact, the <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> zoo
is pleading with <LOCATION>Tacoma</LOCATION> officials to hasten <PERSON>Cindy</PERSON>'s return, said zoo
director <PERSON>Tom Otten</PERSON>.
   It isn't so much that the four-ton <PERSON>Cindy</PERSON> wouldn't mate with any
of the bull elephants in <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>, but three weeks ago she broke a
handler's collarbone with a slap of her trunk.
   ``From time to time, <PERSON>Cindy</PERSON> has made aggressive motions toward
keepers she doesn't like, and that's most of our keepers,'' said
<PERSON>Joel Edelstein</PERSON> of the <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> zoo. ``We wouldn't fight the
decision to let her go.''
   The return has added urgency to the need to build bigger elephant
barns, using money from a prior bond issue.
   Otherwise, <PERSON>Otten</PERSON> said, ``We'll have to go out of the elephant
business.''
   <PERSON>Moyo</PERSON> and <PERSON>Thandi</PERSON>, the zoo's 8-year-old female African elephants,
also could use larger quarters, <PERSON>Otten</PERSON> said.
   Part of the plan is for construction this <DATE>summer</DATE> of a special
yard for <PERSON>Cindy</PERSON> with an elephant ``crush,'' a hydraulic steel device
to contain the animal while trainers trim toenails and tusks,
administer medication and take blood and fluid samples.
   The <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> zoo does not have such a device, so trainers must
rely on each other to keep elephants still.

PROBLEM ELEPHANT BREAKS COLLARBONE OF KEEPER AT ANIMAL PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By TOM GORMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A rambunctious female Asian elephant with a history of outbursts attacked an 
animal keeper without provocation <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> at the <LOCATION>San Diego Wild Animal Park</LOCATION>, 
sending him to the hospital with a broken collarbone. 
</P>
<P>
The elephant, a 26-year-old named <PERSON>Cindy</PERSON>, shoved the keeper with her trunk and 
head. The trainer ended up at the bottom of an 8-foot-deep concrete moat before 
other keepers came to his rescue. 
</P>
<P>
The keeper was identified as 21-year-old <PERSON>David SaoMarcos</PERSON> of <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>, who had 
worked at the park for a year and was assigned to the Asian and African 
elephant yards. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Similar Attack 3 Years Ago 
</P>
<P>
SaoMarcos was taken by <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> paramedics to <ORGANIZATION>Palomar Medical Center</ORGANIZATION> in 
<LOCATION>Escondido</LOCATION>, where he was listed in fair condition with a fractured clavicle, 
bruises, cuts and scrapes. 
</P>
<P>
<DATE>Tuesday</DATE>'s incident was the second in which the 8,000-pound <PERSON>Cindy</PERSON> caused injury 
to a Wild Animal Park employee, park spokeswoman <PERSON>Martha Baker</PERSON> said. Three years 
ago, <PERSON>Cindy</PERSON> lashed out at another keeper with her trunk, knocking him to the 
ground and also breaking his collarbone. Cindy has also tussled with other 
keepers at the park during her six years there, but without serious injuries, 
<PERSON>Baker</PERSON> said. SaoMarcos, who does not work directly with <PERSON>Cindy</PERSON>, was cleaning the 
Asian elephant yard <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME> and was pushing a wheelbarrow of manure 
when <PERSON>Cindy</PERSON> "rapidly approached him from across the yard and struck him with her 
trunk and head," <PERSON>Baker</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
"SaoMarcos tried to get away by going through a gate, but <PERSON>Cindy</PERSON> followed and 
continued to hit and kick him" with her front feet, <PERSON>Baker</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
"Then, the details get sketchy. SaoMarcos ended up at the bottom of the moat. 
He's not sure if he slipped, jumped or she pushed him," <PERSON>Baker</PERSON> said. "Within two 
minutes, other keepers came to his aid. He was climbing out of the moat, but 
was in great pain." 
</P>
<P>
The elephant was not disciplined after <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>'s incident, <PERSON>Baker</PERSON> said, because 
about two minutes had passed between the attack and the time other keepers 
arrived, "and she wouldn't have associated any punishment with what she did." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reluctant to Compare 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Baker</PERSON> said she was reluctant to compare <PERSON>Cindy</PERSON> to Dunda, an 18-year-old African 
elephant at the park that became the focus of investigations into the handling 
and discipline of elephants at the facility, renowned for its success in 
breeding endangered species. 
</P>
<P>
Dunda was chained by all four legs, pulled to the ground and beaten on the 
forehead with ax handles and the wooden end of elephant hooks over two days 
last year as discipline for striking out at keepers, park officials said. <PERSON>Baker</PERSON> 
said <PERSON>Dunda</PERSON> was disciplined immediately after she lashed out at trainers. The 
<LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> city attorney's office declined to prosecute trainers for the 
incident, which generated intense debate about proper discipline of the 
animals. 
</P>
<P>
Cindy is on a breeding loan to the Wild Animal Park from <ORGANIZATION>Point Defiance Zoo</ORGANIZATION> in 
<LOCATION>Tacoma</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wash.</LOCATION>, where she was known as a rogue, having injured trainers there -- 
one so badly that he too had to be hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
Cindy was a 2-year-old refugee from a traveling zoo and was the only elephant 
at the <ORGANIZATION>Point Defiance Zoo</ORGANIZATION> during her 18 years there, said <PERSON>Lily Moore</PERSON>, the zoo's 
assistant director. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Moore</PERSON> said <PERSON>Cindy</PERSON> was maladjusted because of her years in isolation from other 
elephants, and said keepers hoped she would not only breed but experience the 
normal hierarchal nature of elephants at the Wild Animal Park. 
</P>
<P>
But the park's elephant keepers said <PERSON>Cindy</PERSON> never acclimated to her new 
surroundings and failed to socialize with the other animals. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bull Doesn't Like Her 
</P>
<P>
The park's breeding bull "does not like her," <PERSON>Baker</PERSON> said. Even before <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>'s 
attack, the park was planning to transfer her to yet another zoo, thereby 
freeing her stall for a more willing breeding partner. 
</P>
<P>
Cindy's unruly behavior was well known among the trainers and keepers who work 
with the park's elephants, <PERSON>Baker</PERSON> said. "The keepers are very wary around her 
and take extra precautions. Only two keepers will work closely with her. The 
other keepers stay away." 
</P>
<P>
Cindy is not used for rides at the park, nor does she have a role in the park's 
elephant shows, although her trainers have had some success in teaching her to 
lie down and to raise her right foot in a sort of salute. 
</P>
<P>
Baker described <PERSON>Cindy</PERSON>'s behavior <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> as "totally unexplainable, 
unpredictable and out of the blue." The elephant was not removed from the herd 
of eight other Asian cows and the single bull Asian elephant. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no point in isolating her," <PERSON>Baker</PERSON> said. "She received nothing for 
her activity because, unless you catch them in the act, they can't associate 
that (punishment) with that misbehavior." 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, <PERSON>Dunda</PERSON> has not misbehaved since she was disciplined, <PERSON>Baker</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Sure What to Do 
</P>
<P>
Point Defiance Zoo officials, meanwhile, are not sure what to do with <PERSON>Cindy</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
"We are looking at a number of facilities as possible relocations for her," 
<PERSON>Moore</PERSON> said, "including bringing her back to <ORGANIZATION>Point Defiance</ORGANIZATION>. We haven't decided 
what's best for <PERSON>Cindy</PERSON>, and that's our bottom line: what's best for her 
long-term care." 
</P>
<P>
Asian elephants live into their 60s, and are in their prime breeding years 
between 25 and 40, meaning that <PERSON>Cindy</PERSON> is potentially important for the 
endangered species, <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
Cindy's problem is a result of her upbringing as an only elephant, keepers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"She grew up alone, which isn't a good idea because she's a herd species and 
needed to be subjected to normal hierarchical kinds of things that elephants 
establish in a herd," <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> said. "But <PERSON>Cindy</PERSON> didn't have that, and that was 
part of her behavioral maladjustment. 
</P>
<P>
"A parallel would be for a person to be raised to adulthood and never being 
taught manners, and expecting her to be able to behave by the rules. It's 
certainly not <PERSON>Cindy</PERSON>'s fault she's got behavioral problems, and it's not the 
fault of the person who raised her here." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hard to Find a Good Home 
</P>
<P>
Officials hoped she would do better at the <ORGANIZATION>Wild Animal Park</ORGANIZATION>, with its herd of 
Asian elephants and more room to roam. 
</P>
<P>
"But the disappointment for them is that she's still a difficult animal, and 
will be, wherever she is," <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> said. "Since she is our animal, we'd like to 
bring her home or find a suitable home for her, but finding a suitable home is 
more than just name-that-zoo." 
</P>
<P>
Among the zoos negotiating for <PERSON>Cindy</PERSON> is the one in <LOCATION>Syracuse</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>, which has a 
proven breeding bull. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Don Moore</PERSON>, curator of mammals at the <ORGANIZATION>Syracuse Zoo</ORGANIZATION>, said <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> that he is 
still interested in <LOCATION>Cindy</LOCATION> despite her attack on the keeper. 
</P>
<P>
"These animals aren't like dogs," he said. "They're bigger than Volkswagens. We 
know their danger potential. They are individuals, but they are handleable. In 
<PERSON>Cindy</PERSON>'s case, we're prepared for a certain amount of hands-off management."

<TEXT>
   <PERSON>Scott Riddle</PERSON> is making a home where the
elephants roam, where he and the pachyderms can play. Three of
them, weighing at least 4,000 pounds each, lumber around his farm
where cows once grazed.
   Riddle has trained elephants for 26 years for circuses, movies
and advertising. Now the veteran of the <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> Zoo and other
zoos is establishing a breeding farm and sanctuary for elephants on
his 330-acre spread in <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION>.
   ``He's an unusual man,'' said <PERSON>Tony Valenzuela</PERSON>, curator of
mammals at the <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> Zoo and a member of the board of
<ORGANIZATION>Riddle</ORGANIZATION>'s organization.
   Last fall, <PERSON>Riddle</PERSON> left his home in <LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla.</LOCATION>, for <LOCATION>Quitman</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Ark</LOCATION>. He and his wife, <PERSON>Heidi</PERSON>, packed up their two children in the
family motor home, and <PERSON>Mary</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Mugsy</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Solomon</PERSON> climbed into their
custom-built trailer.
   Mary, a 16-year-old Asian elephant, has been with <PERSON>Riddle</PERSON> for
half of her life. She was deemed untrainable when he found her, but
now children climb aboard her for rides at the Little Rock Zoo.
   His other two elephants are from <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>, where they had faced
death in a culling, or herd-thinning, operation. Riddle, who
disagrees with culling, said baby elephants that can be sold are
spared.
   That's how Solomon and Mugsy ended up in <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>. Riddle said
they had been bought by a wealthy man ``who wanted a bunch of
elephants.'' When the novelty wore thin for the prior owner, Riddle
acquired them about five years ago.
   Besides beginning a breeding program, Riddle plans to take in
other orphan elephants. ``We will open the door to any elephant
that needs a home,'' he said. ``And I think that people will call
us.''
   But it's costly to run an elephant farm. Riddle estimated the
weekly cost of keeping one elephant runs about <MONEY>$100</MONEY>. He established
a non-profit corporation last <DATE>summer</DATE> to seek donations,
sponsorships and memberships.
   ``We're the only non-profit corporation dedicated solely to
elephants, I believe, in the world. ... The animal business is
getting very hard because of the position in the world of the
animals, especially elephants, getting extinct,'' he said.
   Poaching, culling and loss of habitat are the greatest threats
to the elephant's survival, said <PERSON>Riddle</PERSON>, who calls for a lifting of
limits on importation of elephants to this country.
   At his farm, Riddle plans to offer instruction on basic handling
of elephants. ``You'd be surprised how many people in the public
want to do it,'' he said.
   ``I'm not a bleeding heart but I think if we can save one
elephant, we can accomplish something. If we save one person from
being hurt, we've accomplished something, because elephants can be
dangerous,'' he said.
   Riddle ranks elephants alongside dolphins and the great apes in
intelligence.
   ``I've been around elephants long enough to know that they are
very, very intelligent,'' he said. ``They have a very intricate
social structure, they discipline their young.
   ``They think, they reason, they plan.''

<TEXT>
   The amorous escapades of a 10,000-pound
Asian elephant named Indy have captured the attention of the zoo
world.
   The 18-year-old pachyderm has impregnated two females at the
Burnet Park Zoo. Babe is expected to deliver her baby around the
<DATE>last week of April</DATE> and <ORGANIZATION>Romani</ORGANIZATION> is due in <DATE>July 1991</DATE>.
   That's earth-shaking news for the continent's zoos, where just
62 calves have ever been born in captivity. It's also a sign of
promise for the 35,000 to 45,000 Asian elephants that remain in the
wild as an endangered species.
   ``North American zoos are getting serious about reproducing
elephants. The two pregnancies at <LOCATION>Syracuse</LOCATION> is evidence we are
making progress,'' said <PERSON>Tom Foose</PERSON>, conservation director for the
<ORGANIZATION>American Association of Zoological Parks</ORGANIZATION> and Aquariums.
   To highlight the importance of the twin pregnancies,
<LOCATION>Jacksonville</LOCATION> Zoological Park Director <PERSON>Dale Tuttle</PERSON> said there are
only six other zoos with pregnant Asian elephants. An elephant's
pregnancy lasts 22 months.
   Only 14 of the AAZPA's approximately 150-member zoos have the
facilities to breed Asian elephants, said <PERSON>Tuttle</PERSON>, coordinator of
the AAZPA's Species Survival Plan for Asian elephants.
   ``There are only 11 proven male breeders in captivity and just
12 females that have reproduced,'' said <PERSON>Foose</PERSON>. ``What's going on in
<LOCATION>Syracuse</LOCATION> is very impressive _ and very significant.''
   ``The survival of the species is dependent, in part, upon the
establishment and maintenance of viable breeding of captive
populations in <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION>. And that's where we come in,'' said
Burnet Park Zoo Director <PERSON>Dave Raboy</PERSON>.
   Like the decision to have a child, starting an elephant family
is not a commitment entered into lightly.
   The zoo decided in <DATE>1979</DATE> that it wanted to breed elephants, said
curator <PERSON>Don Moore</PERSON>. It began by transforming the 350-square-foot
indoor pen that housed its one elephant, <PERSON>Siri</PERSON>, into a spacious
3,200-square-foot indoor-outdoor living area with a breeding barn.
   Romani was purchased in <DATE>1984</DATE> from a circus, which bought her
from an elephant orphanage in <LOCATION>Sri Lanka</LOCATION>. Indy, also an ex-circus
performer from <LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION>Babe</ORGANIZATION>, a one-time gift to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
ambassador to <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>, came to <LOCATION>Burnet Park</LOCATION> in <DATE>June 1985</DATE>.
   With dual pregnancies and a virile male to make it worthwhile,
<LOCATION>Burnet Park</LOCATION> this year is spending <MONEY>$500,000</MONEY> to thrust itself fully
into elephant breeding. The money will be used to further enlarge
and modify the zoo's elephant habitat.
   A single elephant can cost more than <MONEY>$50,000</MONEY> and a suitable
habitat, hundreds of thousands more.
   ``There's no secret,'' said <PERSON>Roger Henneous</PERSON>, the senior elephant
keeper at the <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> Park Zoo in <LOCATION>Portland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ore.</LOCATION>, the nation's
premier Asian elephant breeder. ``In order to have babies you have
to accommodate adult males. You're talking a tremendous financial,
physical commitment to accommodate a mature male. Most places can't
or won't. It's that simple.''
   <LOCATION>Washington Park Zoo</LOCATION>, which has had 24 births in the <DATE>past 28
years</DATE>, has accommodations for three males among its 12-animal herd.
   <PERSON>Chuck Doyle</PERSON>, the senior elephant handler at <LOCATION>Burnet Park</LOCATION>, says
there are other important factors in elephant breeding, one of
which is luck.
   ``Copulation is a learned behavior among elephants. A female has
to see another couple mating, otherwise she won't allow the male to
breed her,'' said <PERSON>Doyle</PERSON>, who broke some ribs in attempts to get
Babe matched up with a mate. ``For three years, we watched Indy
push the females around without success. Finally, he pushed Babe
the right way. Romani needed less time because she witnessed Indy
and Babe.''
   Babe's calf, which will likely weigh about 200 pounds, will be
the first one born at <LOCATION>Burnet Park</LOCATION>. So it's understandable the zoo _
like a first-time parent _ has been excited about the pregnancy.
   ``I feel like I felt having our first child,'' said <PERSON>Moore</PERSON>.
   It's also a first for Babe, who at 36 may be the oldest
first-time Asian elephant mother in captivity. Trainers worry she
may not know what to do when she delivers.
   Babe has gained more than 1,150 pounds since she became pregnant
in <DATE>June 1988</DATE>. She tipped 7,450 when she was weighed by state police
on a truck scale <DATE>Jan. 24</DATE>.
   ``She's a very, very nervous animal, and she's not real thrilled
about people,'' <PERSON>Doyle</PERSON> said at one point, although he said she has
become more sociable during her pregnancy.
   Romani and <PERSON>Siri</PERSON>, who has resisted Indy's advances, will be
allowed to watch the birth, zoo officials said.

2 ELEPHANTS AT ZOO KEPT CHAINED IN CRAMPED BARNS; 
</P>
<P>
ABUSE: CRITICISM BY THE PRIVATE KEEPER OF THE ANIMALS, WHICH FOR SIX YEARS GAVE 
RIDES AT THE ZOO, ADDS FUEL TO A CONTROVERSIAL SUBJECT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Two elephants, which have worked at the <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> Zoo giving rides for six 
years, have spent more than 18 hours a day chained in cramped camel barns since 
the zoo <DATE>last week</DATE> severed a contract with the company that owns them. 
</P>
<P>
Since <DATE>Oct. 12</DATE>, when the zoo abruptly fired <ORGANIZATION>Trunk &amp; Hump</ORGANIZATION>, the elephant and 
camel ride company, it has not allowed the elephants, <PERSON>Katie</PERSON> and Gypsy, to play 
in its recreation areas, according to their keeper, <PERSON>Steve Whitebread</PERSON>. When 
Whitebread let them exercise in the smaller ride area, he said, zoo officials 
told him to stop because they were ruining the foliage. Whitebread disobeyed. 
</P>
<P>
"I just decided there's no way we'd leave them chained up all day," he said. 
"The zoo cut us off. Their attitude is, 'Just keep (the elephants) quiet, don't 
let anybody see them, and get them out of here as soon as possible.' " 
</P>
<P>
The zoo's eagerness to hide the elephants was evident <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME>, when 
employees put up four 8-foot wooden barriers to hide <PERSON>Katie</PERSON> and Gypsy from 
public view. <PERSON>Georgeanne Irvine</PERSON>, a zoo spokeswoman, said the blinds were erected 
after a keeper saw a family climb the low fence and begin petting the animals. 
"It was a potential safety hazard," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine acknowledged that the elephants have not used zoo recreation areas all 
week, but attributed that to a series of misunderstandings. Whoever told 
Whitebread that the areas were off-limits was mistaken, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"We realize they need to exercise," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Whitebread's criticism comes at a time when the zoo is particularly sensitive 
about its treatment of elephants because of news stories last year about Dunda, 
an elephant that was beaten by its keepers after being moved from the zoo to 
the <LOCATION>San Diego Wild Animal Park</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Whitebread said zoo officials have told him that, because they expect national 
news attention to focus on the Soviet arts festival, which kicks off <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, 
they want the <ORGANIZATION>Trunk &amp; Hump</ORGANIZATION> animals out by <DATE>Monday</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Whitebread said that is impossible. His 
</P>
<P>
employer, <ORGANIZATION>Trunk &amp; Hump</ORGANIZATION> owner <PERSON>Marty Dinnes</PERSON>, has a ranch in <LOCATION>Saugus</LOCATION>, north of 
<LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, where he can put the two camels, <PERSON>Doc and Walter</PERSON>, still living at 
the zoo. But the elephants will be harder to house. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't give him any notice, so he's not sure what to do with them," 
<PERSON>Whitebread</PERSON> said. Dinnes was in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> on <DATE>Friday</DATE> and could not be reached. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, zoo officials said they had canceled the contract with Dinnes 
because of space constraints. <PERSON>Jeff Jouett</PERSON>, a zoo spokesman, said animals from 
the zoo's Chit Chat Show will be moved into the area until a <MONEY>$5.5-million</MONEY> 
renovation of their home, <LOCATION>Wegeforth Bowl</LOCATION>, is complete. 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>Irvine</LOCATION> said the zoo's contract with Dinnes specifies that each party would give 
30 days' notice before canceling the rides, but she said that last week both 
had agreed to end the rides immediately and that the zoo would pay Dinnes for 
30 more days, about <MONEY>$14,000</MONEY>. 
</P>
<P>
From <DATE>Oct. 12</DATE> until <DATE>Friday</DATE>, the two Asian elephants had spent most of their time 
in the camel barns, with chains around one front and one hind leg. Because of 
the configuration of the open-air barns, the animals cannot be together. 
Because of poor drainage, they often stand for hours in their own urine. 
Whitebread, who feeds the elephants and cleans their cages twice a day, said 
they have sorely missed what used to be a thrice-weekly ritual: their visits to 
the zoo's elephant recreation area. 
</P>
<P>
"They hate being chained," said <PERSON>Whitebread</PERSON>, a part-time <ORGANIZATION>San Diego State 
University</ORGANIZATION> student who has worked with <PERSON>Katie</PERSON> and Gypsy since they arrived at 
the zoo six years ago. "They used to love playing and swimming in that yard." 
</P>
<P>
As Whitebread spoke with a reporter and photographer <DATE>Friday</DATE>, <PERSON>Tom Hall</PERSON>, the 
zoo's operations manager, appeared. "Have you heard?" he asked Whitebread. "You 
can use our recreation area any time you want." 
</P>
<P>
Whitebread thanked him, but later said: "Of course I hadn't heard. He hadn't 
told me. They've never let us use the yard any time we want. Never." 
</P>
<P>
Whitebread says that for years he has asked the zoo to make changes in the 
camel barns that would improve the elephants' living conditions. He asked for 
the wall between the two barns to be torn down so the elephants could huddle 
together. He asked for grooves to be cut into the concrete floors of the barns 
to provide drainage. In the <DATE>winter</DATE>, when the open-air barns left the animals 
exposed to the cold, he asked for some kind of wind barrier. 
</P>
<P>
"<PERSON>Marty Dinnes</PERSON> said he'd pay for half of anything they did, that he wanted the 
best, but they wouldn't do it," <PERSON>Whitebread</PERSON> said, turning to look at the 
barriers the zoo had installed <DATE>Friday</DATE>. "When I asked, they couldn't do it. But 
when they want it done, it happens overnight." 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>Irvine</LOCATION> said: "We've made some improvements, but there haven't been a lot. 
Sometimes things move slowly around here." She said recent estimates showed 
that it would cost <MONEY>$30,000</MONEY> to <MONEY>$50,000</MONEY> to provide the improvements Whitebread 
requested. 
</P>
<P>
Whitebread said he is worried about what will happen to the elephants once they 
leave the zoo. Katie, a 23-year-old, rambunctious animal who stands nearly 10 
feet tall, will fare best, he said. During her time at the zoo, she has 
occasionally traveled to other locations to work on movies or magazine photo 
assignments, he said. "She can adjust to anything." 
</P>
<P>
But Gypsy is older and more set in her ways. Records put her age at 38 years, 
but elephant keepers believe that the wrinkled, 8-foot-tall animal may be as 
old as 60. "It's hard to say, because every time an elephant is sold, they 
knock a few years off to get a better price," <PERSON>Whitebread</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time <PERSON>Katie</PERSON> went away, Gypsy would just cower without her," said <PERSON>Steve 
Friedlund</PERSON>, a keeper who works with the zoo's elephants. "She's just a 
frightened old lady elephant. She's worn out." 
</P>
<P>
Friedlund said he believes Whitebread has done a good job with the elephants, 
given the limited resources available to him. "But wherever <PERSON>Marty Dinnes</PERSON> takes 
these elephants next and whatever yahoo help he hires -- who knows what these 
elephants will suffer." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Humane Society of <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Larry Boersma</PERSON>, said it has 
been two weeks since the society received any complaints about Gypsy and <PERSON>Katie</PERSON>. 
The society investigated those complaints, which alleged that the animals were 
not being well cared for, but found no basis for intervention, he said.

POOL IS NOW OPEN; TRUNKS REQUIRED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN GAW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Connie was the first to test the waters, delicately dipping the tip of her 
trunk into the murky water, much as a person might wet a toe to check the 
temperature. 
</P>
<P>
She trumpeted loudly. Then, finally, <ORGANIZATION>Connie</ORGANIZATION> took the plunge. 
</P>
<P>
She was the bravest of the <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> Wild Animal Park's seven female Asian 
elephants, which edged up cautiously to their plush new pool shortly after 
being released into the compound <DATE>Monday</DATE>. The pool is designed to provide a more 
aesthetic and natural environment, as well as to get the pachyderms exercising 
more. 
</P>
<P>
"Nita we would have expected to go in right away because she's the dominant 
elephant, and she's usually the one who goes trying something out before others 
will," said <PERSON>Tom Hanscom</PERSON>, spokesman for the park. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, <PERSON>Nita</PERSON> and the others took turns getting wet, only to fling dirt on 
themselves with their trunks once they got out. 
</P>
<P>
"Elephants, when they get wet, they get itchy," elephant program manager <PERSON>Alan 
Roocroft</PERSON> explained. 
</P>
<P>
A boulder placed in a clearing in the compound is at a height just right for 
them to scratch their undersides after a swim, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The <MONEY>$100,000</MONEY> Asian elephant pool, which opens to the public today, has been 
five months in the making and is the first step toward bringing patrons within 
arm's length of the floppy-eared beasts at the park near <LOCATION>Escondido</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
It replaces an older, smaller pool and is similar in size to one built for the 
African elephants in a neighboring compound. 
</P>
<P>
The park hopes to eventually build a deck reaching to the edge of the wading 
pool and to plant grass in parts of the compound, which now is mostly dirt. 
</P>
<P>
The pool and the compound, which includes boulders and ficus and bamboo trees, 
was designed for the convenience and health of the elephants, park employees 
said. 
</P>
<P>
A collage of boulders, some of them weighing 6 tons, were placed in a pattern 
that makes it impossible for them to be dislodged. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of like a jigsaw puzzle," <PERSON>Roocroft</PERSON> said. "We want them to be able to 
get to them and use them as scratching posts, but obviously we don't want them 
to be moving them. Given the right terrain, though, they could move those rocks 
quite easily." 
</P>
<P>
The elephants did succeed in rocking one of the boulders forward, but could not 
pull it out. 
</P>
<P>
The pool gives the elephants a chance to swim, something they couldn't do in 
their old pool. 
</P>
<P>
"Elephants don't move normally in captivity, and you've got to find ways to get 
them to exercise," <PERSON>Roocroft</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
The pool, which is 9 feet deep and has two entrances, is deep enough to put the 
8-foot-tall elephants through a healthy workout and is designed to accommodate 
their social structure. 
</P>
<P>
"If we were to build a pool with just one entrance, you may have a dominant 
animal at the entrance keeping a sub-dominant one in or out of the pool," 
<PERSON>Roocroft</PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
   A veterinary surgical team began a risky
Caesarean section operation today to help Babe, a 36-year-old Asian
elephant, deliver a calf after her labor stopped five days ago.
   The seven-member team led by <PERSON>Dr. Michael Schmit</PERSON>, a veterinarian
from the <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> Park Zoo in <LOCATION>Portland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ore.</LOCATION>, began preparations
for the surgery at about <TIME>11 a.m.</TIME> after drugs administered to the
7,700-pound elephant failed to induce labor.
   ``Everybody's kind of nervous. We've got several hours worth of
surgery ahead,'' said <PERSON>Yvonne Pelletreau</PERSON>, a spokeswoman at the
<ORGANIZATION>Burnet Park Zoo</ORGANIZATION>.
   It will be the third time the veterinary team has attempted a
C-section on an Asian elephant, she said. Only one of the
operations was successful, she said.
   Babe would become the oldest first-time elephant mother to give
birth in a North American zoo.
   Babe began labor <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, but stopped it early <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
Female elephants have the ability to stop their labor when they are
feeling pain and it is not unusual for elephants to take up to five
days to deliver a calf. But zoo officials became concerned about
both mother and infant as the delay continued.
   On <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, a group of four veterinarians from <ORGANIZATION>Cornell
University</ORGANIZATION> checked Babe and found that her cervix was probably too
small for her calf to pass through. They injected her with
Estrabiol to start her cervix dilating, said <PERSON>Pelletreau</PERSON>.
   The drug had some effect, but not enough, so on <DATE>Sunday</DATE> the
veterinarians gave Babe a second injection, she said.
   That second injection caused the elephant's cervix to widen
enough for a calf to pass. Early today, the veterinarians gave Babe
ocytocin, a labor-inducing drug, but it didn't work, she said.
   Babe is one of eight Asian elephants currently pregnant in North
American zoos. A second Burnet Park elephant, <PERSON>Romani</PERSON>, is expected
to give birth in <DATE>July 1991</DATE>.
   Asian elephants are an endangered species that number fewer than
45,000 in the wild.

TACOMA TO TAKE BACK CINDY, AN ALBATROSS OF AN ELEPHANT FOR PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREW LePAGE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Zoo officials in <LOCATION>Tacoma</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wash.</LOCATION>, are making plans for the return of <LOCATION>Cindy</LOCATION>, a 
4-ton Asian elephant once characterized as <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s most dangerous, who did 
little to diminish that reputation during seven years at the <LOCATION>San Diego Wild 
Animal Park</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Cindy will return to the Point Defiance Zoo by fall after leaving the Wild 
Animal Park, where last month she broke the collarbone of one of her keepers 
with a slap from her trunk. 
</P>
<P>
The contract between <LOCATION>Port Defiance</LOCATION> and the Wild Animal Park expired in 
<DATE>December</DATE>, but <LOCATION>Tacoma</LOCATION> officials said that, before the construction of a new 
<MONEY>$1.5-million</MONEY> elephant center, they lacked the expertise and the facilities to 
handle <PERSON>Cindy</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
The center apparently can't open soon enough for Wild Animal Park officials, 
who have had their fill of 24-year-old Cindy. 
</P>
<P>
Though <PERSON>Cindy</PERSON> has a history of attacking keepers at the park, officials say she 
is no more of a problem than some of the other Asian elephants, which tend to 
be aggressive toward each other rather than their keepers. Park officials have 
told the <LOCATION>Tacoma</LOCATION> zoo that they would like to get rid of Cindy as soon as 
possible because she has failed to be mounted by a bull and is using space that 
could be occupied by a willing female. 
</P>
<P>
"We had expressed a desire to move her months before" the <DATE>Jan. 31</DATE> attack, park 
spokesman <PERSON>Tom Hanscom</PERSON> said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>. "We want to make sure she gets a proper 
home that can handle her. She has already become a headline subject." 
</P>
<P>
Two days after the incident, <ORGANIZATION>U. S. Department of Agriculture</ORGANIZATION> officials 
investigated and concluded that <PERSON>Cindy</PERSON> had attacked the keeper without 
provocation. She has since been kept with the park's lone Asian bull to isolate 
her from the remaining eight Asian cows and the keepers. Hanscom said <PERSON>Cindy</PERSON> is 
known to like only one of the park's six keepers in the Asian elephant yard. 
</P>
<P>
Cindy, whose species is endangered, has never mated. In explaining her 
anti-social behavior and fear of bulls, zoo and park officials cite her early 
years in isolation in <LOCATION>Tacoma</LOCATION>. Officials there said they considered using 
artificial insemination to produce offspring during her time there. 
</P>
<P>
The new elephant complex at the <ORGANIZATION>Point Defiance Zoo</ORGANIZATION> will include a "squeeze 
cage," a hydraulically operated device in which <PERSON>Cindy</PERSON> can be immobilized while 
keepers handle her, officials said.

<MEMO>  Q&amp;A  </MEMO>
<TEXT>  A There are many reasons to expect that it wouldn't be possible, yet there is
one report of an accidental but successful mating in a British zoo.;   African
and Asian elephants are distinct species. African elephants, with their big
ears, are the species Loxodonta africana. The slightly smaller Asian
elephants, with smaller ears and a humped back, are the species Elephas
maximus.;   African and Asian elephants could never breed in the wild because
they live on different continents. And now that African elephants are
threatened and Asian elephants endangered, zoos trying to save the species
consider cross-species breeding to be a waste.;   Besides that, animals of
different species usually aren't attracted to each other to mate. When they
do, as when donkeys are bred to horses to produce mules, the offspring may not
be fertile. But horses and donkeys, though different species, both belong to
the genus <ORGANIZATION>Equus</ORGANIZATION>. Asian and African elephants are of different genera,
suggesting they are more distantly related.;   It is rare for animals of
different genera to breed, and if they do, their genetic instructions may be
too incompatible to produce living offspring, according to biologist <PERSON>Robin
Lawson</PERSON> of the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> Academy of Sciences.;    But such a mating apparently
did occur accidentally at the <ORGANIZATION>Chester Zoo</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>. An Asian male
impregnated an African female, said <PERSON>Michael Schmidt</PERSON>, an elephant-breeding
expert at the <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> Park Zoo in <LOCATION>Portland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ore</LOCATION>. The young elephant seemed
to develop normally but died after several weeks. It had the face of an Asian
elephant, the trunk of an African, and intermediate-size ears. You can see it
stuffed in the <ORGANIZATION>Natural History Zoo</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>.  </TEXT>

ANIMAL PARK ATTEMPT TO EXAMINE OVERDUE PREGNANT ELEPHANT FAILS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> Wild Animal Park made a third but unsuccessful attempt on <DATE>Friday</DATE> 
to examine Jean the pregnant elephant, who is more than 60 days overdue. 
</P>
<P>
"We had hoped to have seen the fetus," said <PERSON>Tom Hanscom</PERSON>, a spokesman for the 
park. "But we were unable to ascertain anything." 
</P>
<P>
For weeks, <PERSON>Jean</PERSON>'s keepers have been concerned that the fetus may be dead and 
that Jean may be developing an infection. 
</P>
<P>
This week, they began treating the 19-year-old elephant with hormones to help 
her begin dilating, as well as some antibiotics. 
</P>
<P>
Normal gestation for an elephant takes 615 to 668 days. As of <DATE>Friday</DATE>, <PERSON>Jean</PERSON> has 
been carrying the fetus about 730 days. 
</P>
<P>
Hanscom has said that, if the elephant cannot give birth to the baby, a 
Cesarean section will be considered as the last, drastic option. 
</P>
<P>
"In large mammals, we always expect some small complications in a first 
pregnancy," he said.

"But, if she becomes infected from within, there will be very little we can do

<HEAD>Elephant to Undergo Cesarian to Remove Dead Fetus</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Zoo veterinarians failed to remove a dead
300-pound fetus from an Asian elephant <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, and plan to
attempt a risky Caesarean section <DATE>Monday</DATE> to save the mother.
   Veterinarians fear Jean, the floppy-eared 19-year old mother,
could die a slow, painful death if the decomposing fetus is not
removed, said <LOCATION>San Diego Wild Animal Park</LOCATION> spokesman <PERSON>Tom Hanscom</PERSON>.
   But the Caesarean poses a high risk of infection, <PERSON>Hanscom</PERSON> said.
``We are extremely worried,'' he said.
   ``We wished to avoid a Caesarean because it is such a major
surgical operation,'' the spokesman said.
   Even if the operation is successful, the healing process could
take months, <ORGANIZATION>Hanscom</ORGANIZATION> said.
   Four veterinary surgeons will perform the three-hour procedure,
including <PERSON>Joe Forner</PERSON>, a veterinary surgeon from the <ORGANIZATION>Illinois Equine
Clinic</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>Jim Oosterhuis</PERSON>, the park's director of veterinary services,
will supervise the operation.
   Veterinarians confirmed <DATE>Friday</DATE> that Jean was carrying a dead
fetus. Hanscom said the baby died in <DATE>September</DATE> from fetal distress
after its legs were thrown forward and became wedged in the birth
canal during labor.
   Officials had believed the pachyderm's pregnancy to be a record
when it surpassed that of an Asian elephant that went 720 days
before giving birth at a German zoo. The average term of pregnancy
for such elephants is 618 to 668 days.
   Veterinarians attempted but failed <DATE>Saturday</DATE> to reposition the
fetus so they could pull and remove it, <PERSON>Hanscom</PERSON> said. At 300
pounds, the fetus was too large and too far into the birth canal
for veterinarians to move it successfully.
   Jean has responded to the procedures ``amazingly well,'' <PERSON>Hanscom</PERSON>
said.
   ``She has sat through four fairly stressful exams now,'' he
said. ``She came through it with flying colors and is up on her
feet. But she is showing signs of stress and has visibly lost
weight.''

<TEXT>
   A fetus carried by an Asian elephant for a
record two years is probably dead, say veterinarians at the <LOCATION>San
Diego Wild Animal Park</LOCATION>.
   ``The chances are essentially nil that she is carrying a live
fetus, but there's still an outside chance because she is
healthy,'' <PERSON>James Oosterhuis</PERSON>, park director of veterinary services,
said <DATE>Monday</DATE>.
   The average gestation period for Asian elephants is 618 to 648
days.
   The pregnancy of 19-year-old Jean reached 725 days <DATE>Monday</DATE>,
surpassing that of an Asian elephant that went 720 days before
giving birth at a German zoo.
   Veterinarians attempted an endoscopy on the pachyderm <DATE>last week</DATE>,
but the 5-foot instrument for getting a glimpse of the fetus wasn't
long enough. Park staffers located two longer instruments after
more than a dozen phone calls, but the endoscopy isn't needed
immediately because Jean appears healthy.
   Veterinarians had not decided whether to induce labor or allow
nature to take its course. They are concerned the fetus, which
weighs 185 to 200 pounds, could pass an infection to its 2{-ton
mother, <PERSON>Oosterhuis</PERSON> said.
   ``If she were sick and the going got tough, then we would have
to deal with it immediately,'' <PERSON>Oosterhuis</PERSON> said.

CURRENT PAPERBACKS: ELEPHANT MEMORIES THIRTEEN YEARS IN THE LIFE OF AN ELEPHANT

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Moss offers a scholarly but highly readable account of the complex social 
behavior of the elephants in <LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Amboseli Park</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
In the most intriguing chapters, <PERSON>Moss</PERSON> presents evidence that these intelligent 
animals have a concept of death. They bury their dead and, unlike other 
animals, recognize skeletons of their own species. When elephants encounter 
another's bones, they caress them with their trunks, paying special attention 
to the skulls of relatives. 
</P>
<P>
African elephants are finding those remains with alarming frequency: 80,000 
elephants -- almost <PERCENT>10%</PERCENT> of the total population in <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> -- are slaughtered 
each year for their ivory. As elephants produce one calf every three to five 
years, the species obviously can't sustain this decimation. 
</P>
<P>
But <PERSON>Moss</PERSON> concludes that competition for space with a burgeoning human 
population may pose an even greater threat. The population of <LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION> is expected 
to double by the end of the century, and much of the arable land in the country 
is prime elephant habitat. Although <PERSON>Moss</PERSON> argues eloquently for their 
protection, the extinction of the African elephant appears imminent.

ASIAN ELEPHANTS WARM UP TO POOL AT SAN DIEGO PARK

<P>
Connie was the first to test the waters, delicately dipping the tip of her 
trunk into the murky water, much as a person might put in a toe to check the 
temperature. 
</P>
<P>
She trumpeted loudly. Then, finally, <ORGANIZATION>Connie</ORGANIZATION> took the plunge. 
</P>
<P>
She was the bravest of the <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> Wild Animal Park's seven female Asian 
elephants, edging up cautiously to their plush new pool shortly after being 
released into the compound <DATE>Monday</DATE>. The pool is designed to provide a more 
aesthetic and natural environment, as well as to get the pachyderms exercising 
more. 
</P>
<P>
"Nita we would have expected to go in right away because she's the dominant 
elephant, and she's usually the one who goes trying something out before others 
will," said <PERSON>Tom Hanscom</PERSON>, spokesman for the park. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, <PERSON>Nita</PERSON> and the others took turns getting wet, only to fling dirt on 
themselves with their trunks once they got out. 
</P>
<P>
"Elephants, when they get wet, they get itchy," elephant program manager <PERSON>Alan 
Roocroft</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
A boulder placed in a clearing in the compound is at a height just right for 
them to scratch their undersides after a swim, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The <MONEY>$100,000</MONEY> Asian elephant pool, which opened to the public <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, has been 
five months in the making and is the first step toward bringing patrons within 
arm's length of the floppy-eared beasts at the park near <LOCATION>Escondido</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
It replaces an older, smaller pool and is similar in size to one built for the 
African elephants in a neighboring compound. 
</P>
<P>
The park plans to eventually build a deck reaching to the edge of the wading 
pool and to plant grass in parts of the compound. 
</P>
<P>
The pool and the compound, which includes boulders and ficus and bamboo trees, 
was designed for the convenience and health of the elephants, park employees 
said. 
</P>
<P>
A collage of boulders, some of them weighing six tons, were placed in a pattern 
that makes it impossible for them to be dislodged. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of like a jigsaw puzzle," <PERSON>Roocroft</PERSON> said. "We want them to be able to 
get to them and use them as scratching posts, but obviously we don't want them 
to be moving them. Given the right terrain, though, they could move those rocks 
quite easily." 
</P>
<P>
The elephants succeeded in rocking one of the boulders forward, but could not 
pull it out. The pool gives the elephants a chance to swim, something they 
couldn't do in their old pool. 
</P>
<P>
"Elephants don't move normally in captivity, and you've got to find ways to get 
them to exercise," <PERSON>Roocroft</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
The pool, which is nine feet deep and has two entrances, is deep enough to put 
the 8-foot-tall elephants through a healthy workout and is designed to 
accommodate their social structure. 
</P>
<P>
"If we were to build a pool with just one entrance, you may have a dominant 
animal at the entrance keeping a sub-dominant one in or out of the pool," 
<PERSON>Roocroft</PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Asian Elephant's Calf Dies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM KATES</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A veterinary team tried to perform a
Caesarean section on a 36-year-old Asian elephant <DATE>Monday</DATE>, but
instead removed a dead 266-pound calf from the mother.
   Officials at the <ORGANIZATION>Burnet Park Zoo</ORGANIZATION> said they weren't sure why the
calf, a male, died. They said the position of the calf's head had
prevented the mother, known as <ORGANIZATION>Babe</ORGANIZATION>, from delivering naturally.
   The 7,700-pound Babe was expected to survive the operation by
the special surgical team, zoo officials said.
   It was the third time the team had tried a C-section on an Asian
elephant, and only one of the operations was successful, said zoo
spokeswoman <PERSON>Yvette Pelletreau</PERSON>.
   Babe would have been been the oldest first-time elephant mother
to give birth in a North American zoo. She went into labor
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>.
   The medical team from <ORGANIZATION>Cornell University</ORGANIZATION> and zoos around the
country decided to operate after labor-inducing drugs failed to
bring about a natural birth.
   As preparation for possible surgery, <LOCATION>Burnet Park</LOCATION> on <DATE>Sunday</DATE>
gathered some needed material: two king-size mattresses, a one-ton
chain hoist to lift the calf and two five-ton chain hoists to lift
Babe.
   The zoo world followed Babe's pregnancy because of the rarity of
captive births by Asian elephants, an endangered species that
number less than 45,000 in the wild. There have been just 62 births
in captivity and only 14 North American zoos have Asian-elephant
breeding programs.

   A zoo advocacy group is calling for an
investigation into the cause of a half-dozen puncture wounds on the
head and face of an elephant that injured a veterinarian who was
trying to treat the wounds.
   ``What we're talking about here is abuse,'' <PERSON>Sandra Keller</PERSON>,
spokeswoman for Citizens for a Better Zoo, said <DATE>Sunday</DATE>. ``We have
been receiving complaints about the way these elephants are being
mistreated for several months.''
   Veterinarian <PERSON>Gail Hedberg</PERSON> was treating an abscess on the head of
a 3{-ton Asian elephant named <PERSON>Tinkerbelle</PERSON> when the animal attacked
her <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, fracturing her pelvis.
   Zookeepers said <PERSON>Tinkerbelle</PERSON> did a ``handstand'' on the woman.
<PERSON>Hedberg</PERSON> was listed in stable condition today at <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>
<ORGANIZATION>General Hospital</ORGANIZATION>.
   Some officials defended practices at the <LOCATION>San Francisco Zoo</LOCATION>.
   ``We have to use elephant hooks and other methods that may
appear abusive because we're not talking about puppy dogs and pussy
cats here,'' said zoo director <PERSON>Saul Kitchener</PERSON>. ``How do you get a
10,000-pound elephant's attention?''
   Elephant keeper <PERSON>Michele Radovsky</PERSON> said beating an elephant is no
different from ``people taking rolled newspapers and hitting their
dog.''
   But <PERSON>Paul Hunter</PERSON>, a keeper at the zoo for nine years, said the
abscess on <ORGANIZATION>Tinkerbell</ORGANIZATION>'s head was caused by someone hitting her too
hard with a hooked instrument called an ankuf or elephant hook.
   ``The elephants get beaten up real bad, and I'm getting tired of
it,'' said <PERSON>Hunter</PERSON>.

<HEAD>New American Zoos: Cooped-Up Humans View Free-Roaming Beasts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KILEY ARMSTRONG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American zoos increasingly are becoming a place
where cooped-up humans view free-roaming beasts, and many
institutions are uniting to save endangered species and return them
to the wilderness.
   ``Animals aren't in cages any more. They're in spacious
enclosures, in a much more aesthetically pleasing environment,''
said <PERSON>Charles H. Hoessle</PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION>St. Louis Zoo</ORGANIZATION>. ``Modern
exhibits are being designed to cater to their behavioral needs.''
   The trend is evident at the new <LOCATION>Central Park Zoo</LOCATION>, where
wilderness has been duplicated in the heart of the city. The
revamped facility opens to the public on <DATE>Monday</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Robert Wagner</PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION>American Association of
Zoological Parks</ORGANIZATION> and Aquariums, which grants accreditation, said
the new Central Park Zoo ``clearly depicts the latest state of the
art.''
   Experts at the zoo let the animals tell them what changes to
make. For example, sea lions from the <LOCATION>New York Aquarium</LOCATION> were
invited to work the kinks out of the new pool. And other zoos are
finding ways to keep their animals entertained.
   ``It's quite common in ape exhibits to put sunflower seeds on
the floor so animals have something to do to keep them occupied, or
artificial termite mounds with honey or mustard,'' said <PERSON>Marvin
Jones</PERSON>, registrar of the <LOCATION>San Diego Zoo</LOCATION>. ``It's a way of easing their
boredom.''
   Busch Gardens in <LOCATION>Tampa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla.</LOCATION>, was a trend-setter in <DATE>1965</DATE>,
enclosing visitors on a monorail while the gazelles and zebras
frolicked unfettered on 60 acres. In the early <DATE>1970s</DATE>, drive-through
parks proliferated.
   Since then, realistic settings have multiplied. In <DATE>1987</DATE>, the zoo
association's 132 members spent nearly <MONEY>$500 million</MONEY> building or
renovating exhibits, <PERSON>Wagner</PERSON> said. ``American zoos are in their
heyday,'' he said.
   ``The public has changed, due to television primarily. People
are able to see how animals live in the wild'' and expect no less
from zoos, <PERSON>Jones</PERSON> said.
   The Bronx Zoo's <LOCATION>Jungle World</LOCATION>, a 37,000-square-foot, indoor
microcosm opened in <DATE>1985</DATE>, boasts five waterfalls, a cloud machine,
100 species of tropical plants and 780 animals, including
endangered <LOCATION>Bali</LOCATION> mynah birds.
   In <LOCATION>St. Louis</LOCATION>, school children and scholars can study ecology and
endangered species next <DATE>spring</DATE> while viewing one-celled animals and
a ``living model'' of a <LOCATION>Missouri Ozarks</LOCATION> stream at the zoo's new <MONEY>$16
million</MONEY>, 55,000-square-foot educational complex.
   Visitors in <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> perch on a wooden observation platform, a la
safari, to experience the world's only naturalistic, multifamily
gorilla complex. The zoo was renovated after it lost accreditation
amid grisly stories of animal abuse.
   ``Where we can put animals on grass with natural foliage, fresh,
bubbling water and open sky, it makes us feel a whole lot better _
and as far as I know, the animals like it better,'' said <PERSON>Gerald S.
Lentz</PERSON>, zoological manager of <ORGANIZATION>Busch Gardens</ORGANIZATION>, which boasts 21 Asian
elephants and other endangered species among its 3,300 mammals,
birds and reptiles.
   Such amenities are necessary: zoos must breed more endangered
species _ while at the same time captivating public sentiment for
that cause.
   While animals aren't fooled by fake jungles or fields, the
wildlife settings ``help provide the visitor with a sense of
appreciation for the conservation of wild places,'' <PERSON>Wagner</PERSON> said.
   ``Zoos are becoming a last resort for vanishing species.
Municipal peoples, who are furthest from wildlife but who support
zoos, are ultimately beginning to play an ever larger role in
helping to sustain wildlife,'' said <PERSON>Dr. William Conway</PERSON>, director of
the <ORGANIZATION>New York Zoological Society</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``The new role of zoos is coming about because there are too
damn many people,'' <PERSON>Conway</PERSON> said. ``Within the next 20 or 30 years,
we will lose, at the very least, <PERCENT>20 percent</PERCENT> of the remaining plant
and animal species on earth.''
   Zoos are not only focusing their efforts on breeding endangered
species, such as <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> condor program, but are
also educating the public about them.
   ``We don't give a darn if people know that Asian elephants have
the bigger ears and African elephants the smaller ears,'' <PERSON>Conway</PERSON>
said. ``But if they like elephants, they may reflect upon the
meaning of elephants the next time they tickle the ivory keys on
their piano that resulted in some elephant's death.''
   Zoo association members share endangered animals and
technologies. There are special breeding facilities operated in
Front Royal, <LOCATION>Va.</LOCATION>, by the <ORGANIZATION>National Zoological Park</ORGANIZATION>; on <LOCATION>St.
Catherines Island</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ga.</LOCATION>, by the <ORGANIZATION>New York Zoological Park</ORGANIZATION>, and the
Zoological Park of <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>. The <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> society's <ORGANIZATION>Wildlife
Conservation International</ORGANIZATION> sponsors scientists in 35 countries.
   There also is a zoo movement in reverse. In <DATE>November</DATE>, zoo
association members shipped endangered mynah birds back to <LOCATION>Bali</LOCATION>,
where agricultural development had gobbled their native rain
forests. Early reports are that the program is a success, <PERSON>Wagner</PERSON>
said.
   Similar successes have occurred with the return of black buck
antelopes to <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>; tamarin monkeys to <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>, and Arabian
oryxes, another type of antelope, to <LOCATION>Jordan</LOCATION>, he said.
   ``There is no substitute for nature,'' <PERSON>Conway</PERSON> said. ``We seek,
instead, to be a salesman for nature.''

<HEAD>Animal Rights Group Claims Responsibility in Attacking Trainer
Property</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A radical animal rights group claimed
responsibility for defacing the homes and cars of three trainers
involved in the disciplinary beating of a zoo elephant.
   Members of the <ORGANIZATION>Animal Liberation Front</ORGANIZATION> poured red paint on the
trainers' cars, let air out of their tires and splashed their homes
with abrasive paint-stripping chemicals either early <DATE>Friday</DATE> or <TIME>late
Thursday night</TIME>, said <PERSON>Nancy Burnet</PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION>Coalition to
Protect Animals</ORGANIZATION> in Entertainment.
   The dispute that has been broiling since <DATE>February</DATE> over the
chaining and beating of the animal has included investigations by
the local and national <ORGANIZATION>Humane Society</ORGANIZATION>, the city attorney's office
and the <ORGANIZATION>American Association of Zoological Parks</ORGANIZATION> and Aquariums.
   Burnet, who said she does not belong to the Animal Liberation
Front but supports its action, told <ORGANIZATION>The Associated Press</ORGANIZATION> she
received a call from a group member <DATE>Friday</DATE> claiming responsibility
for the vandalism.
   The trainers were all employees of the <ORGANIZATION>San Diego Zoological
Society</ORGANIZATION>, said <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> Zoo spokeswoman <PERSON>Martha Baker</PERSON>. No one was
injured in the episode, she said.
   ``We are outraged that the victims and their families have been
terrorized in such a manner,'' said <PERSON>Doug Myers</PERSON>, executive director
of the zoological society, which operates the zoo and affiliated
Wild Animal Park. ``Personally attacking our employees is purely
reprehensible.''
   In a statement released through <ORGANIZATION>Burnet</ORGANIZATION>, the group said its acts
were in response to the trainers' handling of Dunda, an 18-year-old
African elephant at the Wild Animal Park near <LOCATION>Escondido</LOCATION> in northern
<LOCATION>San Diego County</LOCATION>.
   When Dunda was transferred from the zoo to the Wild Animal Park
in <DATE>February</DATE>, the trainers reported that she became unruly and at
one point acted like she was trying to kill them.
   To prevent the elephant from getting out of control, the
trainers said they had to chain the animal and beat her repeatedly
with wooden sticks.
   The Zoological Society defended the trainers' actions, saying
they took the necessary steps to regain control of Dunda. Others
have criticized the form of discipline, including several park
employees who witnessed it.
   The national <ORGANIZATION>Humane Society</ORGANIZATION> called the beating an isolated case
of animal abuse, but left any changes in the handling of elephants
to the <ORGANIZATION>Zoological Society</ORGANIZATION>'s discretion. The local <ORGANIZATION>Humane Society</ORGANIZATION>
and the city attorney's office, cleared the zoo of abuse
allegations.
   In response to the situation, the <ORGANIZATION>American Association of
Zoological Parks</ORGANIZATION> and Aquariums created a task force to set
nationwide elephant training standards considered later by its
board of directors. Last month, the group ruled the <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>
trainers did not violate ethical standards.

<HEAD>One Elephant Kills Trainer, Second Takes People On Wild Ride</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT MYERS, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One normally docile elephant took three
people on a wild ride through a zoo and then plunged into a lake
with them, and a second elsehwhere in <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> killed a trainer it
liked and then walked calmly away.
   Trainers did not know what spooked either animal.
   A 4-ton, 15-year-old female elephant used for paid rides at the
<LOCATION>Southwest Florida</LOCATION> Fair at <ORGANIZATION>Fort Myers</ORGANIZATION> broke loose from a petting zoo,
tore through a crowded midway and plunged into a lake while carrying
three terrified riders, one of them 4 years old.
   ``We were afraid he was going to kill us _ stomp on us,'' said
<PERSON>Consolacion Cruz of Alva</PERSON>, who was aboard the elephant with her young
godson and his 18-year-old aunt.
   At least eight people were sent to local hospitals <DATE>Saturday</DATE> with
minor back injuries and grease burns from fryers in toppled
concession stands.
   <PERSON>Joe Frisco</PERSON>, an elephant caretaker, managed to grab a chest strap
and slow the elephant until she stepped on a water tube. Water shot
up, spooking the elephant again. She crashed into another stand
before <LOCATION>Frisco</LOCATION> was able to stop the animal and guide her back to the
corral.
   ``She had to be hit with a pellet gun or something. She'd never

   At <ORGANIZATION>Busch Gardens</ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION>Tampa</LOCATION>, trainer <PERSON>Joseph Allen</PERSON> was returning a
17-year-old, 3-ton male elephant to its barn <DATE>Sunday</DATE> when he was
knocked down and the animal used its head to crush him, said Sgt.

   ``Either he fell over the threshold of the barn door or the
elephant pushed him. We'll never know,'' said <PERSON>Busch</PERSON> spokeswoman
<PERSON>Glenda Gilmore</PERSON>.
   The elephant then pulled up its head and walked back into the
yard, she said.
   ``The elephant was tame, but not trained to do tricks,'' <PERSON>Gilmore</PERSON>
said. ``The elephant knew him, and the elephant liked him.''
   The elephant has been at <LOCATION>Busch Gardens</LOCATION> for about four months. It
is one of two males among the 22 Asian elephants at the park,
<PERSON>Gilmore</PERSON> said.
   <PERSON>Allen</PERSON>, 33, a 12-year park veteran, died at <ORGANIZATION>Tampa General Hospital</ORGANIZATION>
of multiple injuries, a hospital spokesman said.
   The accident, which occurred out of public view, was the first
fatality caused by an animal at the 30-year-old African theme park,

   Veterinarians undertook an emergency
Caesarean section on a 36-year-old Asian elephant, but the
266-pound calf was removed dead.
   Officials at the <ORGANIZATION>Burnet Park Zoo</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>Monday</DATE> they weren't sure
why the calf, a male, died.
   The position of the calf's head had prevented the mother, <LOCATION>Babe</LOCATION>,
from delivering naturally, making the C-section necessary.
   ``Until the fetus came out of the uterus, it was a coin toss,''
said Zoo Director <PERSON>Dave Raboy</PERSON>, who gave the go-ahead for the
four-hour operation <DATE>Monday</DATE> by a medical team from <ORGANIZATION>Cornell
University</ORGANIZATION> and zoos around the country.
   The 7,700-pound Babe would have been been the oldest first-time
elephant mother to give birth in a North American zoo. She went
into labor <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
   It was the third C-section tried on an Asian elephant, and only
one of the operations was successful, said zoo spokeswoman <PERSON>Yvette
Pelletreau</PERSON>.
   In preparation for surgery, <ORGANIZATION>Burnet Park</ORGANIZATION> had gathered two
king-size mattresses, a one-ton chain hoist to lift the calf and
two five-ton chain hoists to lift Babe.
   The zoo world followed Babe's pregnancy because of the rarity of
captive births by Asian elephants, an endangered species that
numbers fewer than 45,000 in the wild. There have been just 62
births in captivity.
   <PERSON>Raboy</PERSON> said it was possible Babe, who was back on her feet hours
after the operation, could give birth again. Female elephants can
breed into their 60s. ``We have high hopes for the future. She's in
superb condition,'' he said.

   A happy event is imminent, but even though it's
at the zoo no one expects the stork to deliver this bundle of joy _
he or she will weigh about 200 pounds.
   Bozie, an 5,740-pound Asian elephant, is in her 20th month of
pregnancy and delivery isn't long off, say officials at the Lincoln
Park Zoo.
   ``We have a thousand things to prepare for,'' said <PERSON>Mark
Rosenthal</PERSON>, the zoo's curator of mammals. ``We want to get a viable,
healthy baby on the ground.''
   Bozie's little one will be only the 16th of its species born in
the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> since <DATE>1985</DATE>, and the first for <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> and the
Lincoln Park Zoo. Only 10 of those calves have survived.
   Officials surveyed zoos all over the world for information about
elephant pregnancies. As Bozie's pregnancy progressed, keepers
began taking her measurements and weighing her.
   They even built a new room for the delivery where Bozie, who has
gained 800 pounds during her pregnancy, sleeps away from the zoo's
other elephants.
   A suburban <LOCATION>Northbrook</LOCATION> horse veterinarian who knows how to
perform a Caesarean section on an elephant plans be on hand during
the birth in case of complications.
   ``We're all excited,'' <PERSON>Rosenthal</PERSON> said. ``But we're keeping it
calm until we see that we have a successful birth. Then we'll
probably get real excited.''
   The zoo had to go to a lot of trouble to get Bozie in a family
way, since it has no male elephants.
   Bozie was sent to <ORGANIZATION>Dickerson Park Zoo</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Springfield</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mo.</LOCATION>, where
she and a male elephant named <ORGANIZATION>Onyx</ORGANIZATION> hit it off. Bozie was returned
to the Lincoln Park Zoo after a one-year stay in <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION>.

The African elephant that underwent the first-ever Cesarean section on a

<TEXT>     "It's just a real shock to all of us," <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> said. "It was completely
unexpected. This elephant was considered a very responsive and cooperative
animal.";    <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> said one of the zoo's three elephants -- they are not sure
which one, but believe it was "Smoky," an 18-year-old African bull elephant --
approached <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON>. He told the beast to "get back," a common command to which
elephants normally respond.;    But rather than retreat, the elephant
hesitated and then continued toward Jackson.;    One witness reported seeing
the elephant kick <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON> in the upper body or head area.;    <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> described
<PERSON>Jackson</PERSON> -- who was in his mid-50s -- as a "highly qualified trainer" who had a
15-year relationship with the elephants. He was one of three keepers
authorized to enter the enclosure. <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> said it is not unusual for the
elephants to approach keepers, and they often do so out of curiosity or hoping
for a handout of a banana or an orange.;    After <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON> was injured, the
elephants got excited, and Smoky nudged the body with his foot, <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> said.
Zoo visitors then started yelling at the elephants to "get back, get away" 
from the body. Other keepers then arrived with food to distract the elephants
from the body and to keep them under control.;    <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> said zoo officials
believe it was either Smoky or a 13-year-old female named <PERSON>Lisa</PERSON> that injured
Jackson.;    "We've always felt we've been blessed because we had such
wonderful, cooperative elephants," <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> said.;    The only other problem zoo
officials have had with the elephants was four or five months ago when <PERSON>Lisa</PERSON>,
described as high-spirited, charged a new trainer, injuring the trainer's
hand. She said officials don't know what they'll do with the elephant that
injured Jackson.;    "We are going to observe the elephants and try to piece
this all together and make some sense out of it," <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> said. "But despite the
fact that the elephants were raised here at the zoo since they were babies,
they are still wild animals, and that's the bottom line."  </TEXT>

<TEXT>
   Babe, the Asian elephant whose calf was
stillborn in an emergency Caesarean section last month, died
<DATE>Saturday</DATE>, said a Burnet Park Zoo official.
   The cause of death was unknown, said <PERSON>Bob Geraci</PERSON>, spokesman for
<LOCATION>Onondaga County Parks</LOCATION>, which operates the zoo.
   <PERSON>Geraci</PERSON> said the 36-year-old, 7,700-pound Babe died at <TIME>1:39 p.m.</TIME>
with veterinarians in attendance.
   ``They let her lay down all on her own. She gave a sigh and then
she died,'' <PERSON>Geraci</PERSON> said.
   Babe's body was to be moved to the <ORGANIZATION>Cornell School of Veterinary
Medicine</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Ithaca</LOCATION> for an autopsy, <PERSON>Geraci</PERSON> said.
   Babe underwent an emergency Caesarean section <DATE>April 23</DATE> in a
failed attempt to save her unborn calf. Experts said the 266-pound
bull calf died from trauma when it could not position itself
properly in the uterus.
   After the surgery, Babe's condition deteriorated and she was
kept alive with intravenous doses of dextrose and amino acids.
   On <DATE>Friday</DATE>, a team of experts had dismissed calls to have Babe
humanely killed, saying she did not appear to be in pain.
   The zoo's veterinarian, <PERSON>Carolee Wallace</PERSON>, said Babe appeared
stable, not critical, and had shown strength and a desire to live.
   The zoo world closely watched Babe's 22-month pregnancy because
of the rarity of births among Asian elephants in captivity. The
endangered species numbers less than 45,000 in the wild, and only
62 have been born in captivity.
   Babe would have been the oldest first-time elephant mother to
give birth in captivity.

   An elephant who had been pregnant for more than
two years was back on her feet after veterinarians completed a
risky Caesarean section to remove a dead fetus.
   Six veterinarians and three equine surgeons at the <LOCATION>San Diego
Wild Animal Park</LOCATION> spent 5{ hours <DATE>Monday</DATE> on the procedure on <ORGANIZATION>Jean</ORGANIZATION>, a
19-year-old, 7,000-pound Asian elephant who was believed to have
been pregnant for more than 730 days. The normal gestation period
is between 618 and 648 days.
   The Caesarean section was performed as a last resort after <PERSON>Jean</PERSON>
was unable to deliver the 300-pound calf and her system did not
abort the fetus.
   Veterinarians had feared that the elephant could die a slow,
painful death if the decomposing fetus was not removed, park
spokesman <PERSON>Tom Hanscom</PERSON> said.
   Park officials will keep Jean in isolation to make sure she does
not contract infections or break her sutures.
   ``She was a little shaky, but she was a good patient during the
anesthesia and she maintained herself very well, including body
temperature and pulse,'' said <PERSON>Dr. Jim Oosterhuis</PERSON>, the park's
director of veterinary services who directed the procedure.
   He said park officials believed it was the first Caesarean
section ever performed on an elephant.
   ``It was very stressful. It was a big procedure and it took a
lot of effort,'' he said. ``There's a good possibility that she
will not be able to breed again and even if she were able to, we
might not want to try to breed her to avoid problems that could
occur from this procedure.''
   The equine surgeons were brought in because of their work with
horses, whose anatomy resembles that of an elephant, <PERSON>Hanscom</PERSON> said.
   After weeks of tests, veterinarians confirmed on <DATE>Saturday</DATE> that
Jean was carrying a fetus that died sometime in <DATE>September</DATE>.
   The elephant was under general anesthesia for the operation.
After the operation was completed, veterinarians administered a
drug to counteract the anesthesia.
   Five minutes later, Jean stood up on her feet, to the cheer of
the surgical team and other park employees.
   ``We are relieved and quite pleased that she even made it
through today's procedure,'' <PERSON>Hanscom</PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
   Wildlife specialists have squared
off for a bitter fight over how to keep <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>'s endangered
elephant population from vanishing forever into ivory piano keys
and chess pieces.
   Delegates from more than 100 countries will meet through <DATE>Oct. 20</DATE>
at the biennial conference of the <ORGANIZATION>Convention on International Trade
in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Flora</PERSON>. There were strategy
sessions <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, but the conference formally opens today.
   Although they will also consider the smooth-coated otter, the
salmon-crested cockatoo and a Noah's Ark of other species,
attention is focused on pachyderms and their valuable ivory.
   By some reckoning, the great lumbering African elephant, for
many an unmatchable symbol of the wild, will survive mainly in zoos
by the turn of the century.
   ``When we talk about halving the population in 10 years, we're
talking about disaster,'' <PERSON>Iain Douglas-Hamilton</PERSON>, a widely respected
expert, said in an interview from <LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION>.
   <ORGANIZATION>David Western of Wildlife Conservation International</ORGANIZATION>, who
commissioned the last census, said: ``Numbers are dropping so fast
elephants may be exterminated in most areas within 20 or 30 years.''
   Overall, he said, just more than 600,000 remain in <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>,
compared to estimates ranging from 1.3 million to <MONEY>4 million</MONEY> a
decade ago. Each year, poachers kill at least 70,000, often
spraying gunfire at females and calves along with the few old
tuskers left.
   In <LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION> alone, fewer than 17,000 are left of the 165,000
elephants counted in <DATE>1970</DATE>.
   The convention's rulings become non-legally binding agreements
that rely on international pressure for enforcement. A convention
member may abstain from a resolution, but risks being branded an
environmental bad guy.
   Delegates must find common ground between the East African
demand for an ivory ban, backed by the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Western
Europe</LOCATION>, and southern <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>'s push for trade in culled tusks.
   <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Botswana</LOCATION> argue that careful
management has increased their herds and that ivory finances
anti-poaching measures.
   ``We have a very healthy elephant population that must be culled
or it will simply destroy its own environment,'' <PERSON>Bosman Olivier</PERSON> of
<LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Department for Environmental Affairs</ORGANIZATION> said in
<LOCATION>Johannesburg</LOCATION>.
   <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION> earns <MONEY>$9 million</MONEY> a year by selling ivory from herds
estimated at 52,000.
   ``You don't ban something valuable, you protect it,'' said
<PERSON>Ingrid Schroeder</PERSON> of the Save Endangered African Wildlife, which
works in <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>William Nduku</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION>'s director of parks and wildlife said,
``It's not fair to treat <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> as if it was a small country.''
   But a broad coalition of experts and environmentalists,
including <ORGANIZATION>Greenpeace</ORGANIZATION> and the Humane Society of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>,
say that exceptions to a ban leave doors wide open to abuse.
   ``These arguments are based on a pack of lies: the numbers, the
level of poaching and the ability to control trade,'' said <PERSON>Craig
Van Note</PERSON> of the Washington-based Monitor Consortium.
   Elephants and poachers ignore orders, experts say, and trade in
wildlife products is as hard to control as drug trafficking.
Documents are easy to falsify.
   For example, <LOCATION>Burundi</LOCATION> lost its last elephant, an old bull, years
ago, but officials there have managed to export up to 100 tons per
year of ivory.
   In <DATE>1986</DATE>, the convention granted a blanket amnesty to 89 tons of
ivory in <LOCATION>Burundi</LOCATION> as the start of an African quota system. Since
then, convention officials admit another 87 tons of ivory _ the
tusks of nearly 15,000 elephants _ have appeared in the nation.
   The ban lobby is countered by well-funded traders, mostly based
in <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION>, who fear an end to a <MONEY>billion-dollar</MONEY> industry in
carvings, jewelry and personalized name stamps used widely in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>.
   African elephants fall under the convention's Appendix Two for
threatened species. Controlled trade is allowed in that category.
Shifting them to Appendix One, endangered species, would mean a ban.
   <PERSON>Eugene Lapointe</PERSON>, secretary-general of the convention, has
recommended a split-listing placing elephants on Appendix One but
allowing those countries with controlled legal trade to continue.
   He said a total ban might force some member countries to declare
reservations, allowing them to bypass convention guidelines.
   Western said he favors a ban but with accommodation for southern
<LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>, under strict control. He is working on a method of tracing
tusks based on genetic ``fingerprinting.''
   But many specialists express concern that complex exceptions
could lead to the end of elephants in the wild.
   Experts note the southern <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> group includes <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Angola</LOCATION>, where lingering civil wars have decimated wildlife.
Mozambican rebels and Zambian poachers frequently penetrate Zambian
reserves.
   <PERSON>Cynthia Moss</PERSON>, author of ``Elephant Memories,'' said, ``<LOCATION>Zambia</LOCATION> is
wearing blinders. They cannot stop the poaching.''
   Van Note testified before the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Congress</ORGANIZATION> last year that
poaching is rampant in parts of southern <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>. A few recent
incidents suggest serious problems.
   Last month, South African newspapers reported a plane that
crashed on takeoff from an <LOCATION>Angola</LOCATION> rebel camp was overloaded with
ivory. The Portuguese pilot, <PERSON>Joaquim Augusto</PERSON>, owned a truck found
earlier in <LOCATION>Namibia</LOCATION> with 7 tons of tusks.

   Last year, after <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> groups accused <LOCATION>Pretoria</LOCATION> of helping <ORGANIZATION>UNITA</ORGANIZATION>
finance its rebellion by trafficking ivory, a South African board
of inquiry denied any large-scale military involvement. But the
board said the army did help <ORGANIZATION>UNITA</ORGANIZATION> transport tusks from <DATE>1976</DATE> to
<DATE>1979</DATE>.
   Two South African army officers were among six people indicted
last year in <LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION> on charges of smuggling rhino horn, skins
of endangered animals and assault rifles into the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>.

<TEXT>     Routine stuff, really.;   Except that instead of a lollipop, <PERSON>Mardji</PERSON> gets a
couple of dozen bananas and a loaf of French bread. That's a fitting reward
for a four-ton, 41-year-old Asian elephant on medical leave from her day's
work hauling logs or carrying kids at <ORGANIZATION>Marine World Africa USA</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Vallejo.</LOCATION>;  
For generations, wild animals at circuses, zoos and animal parks have been
trained to entertain the public by standing on hind legs, balancing balls or
roaring on command. But today, out of the public eye, veterinarians and
caretakers increasingly are using similar behaviors -- and inventing new ones
-- to help keep captive animals healthy.;   Primates, elephants and tigers,
for example, are on the growing list of animals trained to give blood without
biting, crushing or clawing the person pushing in the needle.;   Two mornings
a week at <ORGANIZATION>Marine World</ORGANIZATION>, the park's two female "killer" whales slide their
massive frames sideways onto a concrete deck at their trainers' command -- and
urinate into a paper cup. In addition to routine medical tests, the samples
provide a record of their progesterone levels that may help researchers
develop an artificial insemination program for orcas.;   "We're turning a page
on history in the way we treat captured exotic animals," said <PERSON>Gary Priest</PERSON>, 40,
who six months ago became the first animal behaviorist hired by the <LOCATION>San Diego
Zoo</LOCATION> and Wild Animal Park. "We started with marine mammals maybe 20 years ago. 
. .  But now we're finding the same techniques work with terrestrial animals
real well.";   <PERSON>Take Loon</PERSON>, one of only 18 members of the endangered drill
species in captivity in this country. The 12-year-old arboreal baboon, the
only male drill at the <LOCATION>San Diego Zoo</LOCATION>, has diabetes and requires daily insulin
shots.;   "He was having to be restrained daily, which was extremely
stressful," Priest said.;   Enter Priest. In six weeks, he and the zoo's staff
taught Loon to sit voluntarily for daily injections and regular blood tests.; 
 The method: operant conditioning, a long-established system of rewards for
desired behaviors.;   Building on the pleasure drills take in grooming, zoo
keepers rewarded Loon with bananas or grapes each time he'd let them groom his
back. The process of "desensitizing" continued as the keepers first dragged
their finger down Loon's skin and then began pulling at tufts of hair, each
time rewarding him for tolerating the new sensation.;   'It was a non-event';
"By the time you actually gave him a shot and used the needle, it was a
non-event," <PERSON>Priest</PERSON> said. "The social contact was as least as reinforcing as
the food reward.";   At the <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION> Zoo recently, <PERSON>Mikey</PERSON>, a 6-year-old
chimpanzee, soaked a bite on his foot in an antiseptic solution on command.
His reward: raisins.;   "If this was an animal that was truly a wild
chimpanzee, you'd have to use anesthesia twice a day to get him to soak it,"
said <PERSON>Joel Parrott</PERSON>, the 39-year-old veterinarian who is the zoo's director.;  
Training of any kind is new -- and somewhat tentative -- at most zoos. But at
<ORGANIZATION>Marine World</ORGANIZATION>, medical behaviors are just a natural extension of the training
for entertainment that goes on every day. And the close relationship between
keeper and captive wild animal makes care easier for the staff and <PERSON>Gage</PERSON>, the
park's veterinarian.;   <PERSON>When Jolyn</PERSON>, a 6-year-old orangutan, got a piece of
foxtail caught in her throat, trainer <PERSON>Kirk Loveland</PERSON> instructed her to stick
out her tongue. He was able to pluck out the embedded grass with forceps.;  
Lengthy procedure; When "Ma" Rhino got a nasty infection between her two
horns, one caretaker gave her a regular bristle-brush rubdown while others
filed through her upper horn with piano wire. The procedure took three days.; 
 And when Stormy, a bottlenose dolphin, gave birth to <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> <DATE>two months ago</DATE>,
<PERSON>Gage</PERSON> had followed the pregnancy through ultrasound from its fifth week because
of a series of medical behaviors the dolphins had been taught.;   Where in the
past, says <PERSON>Gage</PERSON>, "you had to have the biggest trainer sit on the dolphin and
hold its tail" for a blood sample, today the dolphins will present their
flukes. At most checkups, <PERSON>Gage</PERSON> gives them a rubdown to build rapport. And four
or five times a year, either she or the trainer draws blood.;   <ORGANIZATION>Vigga</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Yaka</ORGANIZATION>
also lie on the deck by the pool and allow trainers or <PERSON>Gage</PERSON> to draw blood.
With killer whales, the procedure once meant draining the pool at a cost of
<MONEY>$10,000</MONEY> -- and enormous stress on the orcas.;   <PERSON>Jay Sweeney</PERSON>, a 46-year-old <LOCATION>San
Diego</LOCATION> veterinarian who pioneered marine-mammal medical training, says it's
played a critical role in keeping these fragile -- and expensive -- animals
alive in captivity.;   "It's a common belief that marine mammals have evolved
to find mechanisms of hiding their symptoms (when sick) because it's the
abnormality in the ocean that triggers the predator-prey relationship," he
said. "If we can find a way of checking in with the animals more frequently or
routinely, we have a chance of finding early indications of disease.";  
Medical behaviors do something else for animal parks: They enhance their
public image.;   "It's a good political tool to get (the zoo or oceanarium) to
show they really do care about the welfare of the animal," says <PERSON>Tim Desmond</PERSON>,
42, a behavioral psychologist whose Torrance company, <ORGANIZATION>Active Environments,
Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, helps zoos solve problems.;   And politics count at a time when
animal-rights groups are pushing to ban the capture of dolphins and orcas.
These calls were renewed last week following the death of an orca at a <LOCATION>Sea
World</LOCATION> park, the fifth such death in two years.;   To Desmond, whose clients
include the <LOCATION>San Diego Zoo</LOCATION>, the issue is not whether but how to work with wild
animals.;   Zoos and animal parks "have both erred," he says. "A lot of animal
shows exploited animals by overworking them or working them in ways that are
aversive to the animals. The zoos' error has been to (underwork) the animal.";
  Critics, however, charge that training, for show or care, can be dangerous
-- to animal and trainer.;   "Zoos have two main purposes: One is to educate
the public, the other is to propagate the species," says <PERSON>Patricia Derby</PERSON>, 49,
co-founder of the <ORGANIZATION>Performing Animal Welfare Society</ORGANIZATION>. "The animals don't need
to be trained to do either of these.";   <ORGANIZATION>Derby</ORGANIZATION>, a former trainer, points to
Dunda, an elephant caretakers at <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>'s Wild Animal Park beat with an ax
handle for several days in <DATE>1988</DATE> to discipline her.;   <ORGANIZATION>Dunda</ORGANIZATION>'s beating spurred
the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> legislature to forbid "abusive behaviors" toward elephants,
including electric shocks and punishment that broke the skin.;   The law's
sponsor, <PERSON>Sen. Dan McCorquodale</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-San Jose</LOCATION>, has submitted another bill, before
the <ORGANIZATION>Senate Natural Resources</ORGANIZATION> committee, that would limit the hours elephants
can be chained and require an environment "adequate to their psychological
well-being." The bill will come up for hearings next year.;   A bill in
<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>, sponsored earlier this month by Rep. <PERSON>Peter Kostmayer</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-Pa.</LOCATION>, would
extend protections against training abuse to all animals in captivity for
exhibition. A similar bill last year died in committee.;   For <PERSON>Parrott</PERSON> of the
<ORGANIZATION>Oakland Zoo</ORGANIZATION>, the issue is handler safety as well as animal abuse.;   Elephant
killed caretaker; On <DATE>Jan. 12</DATE>, a male elephant there charged and killed a
longtime caretaker cleaning the elephant exhibit. Now the zoo is moving toward
a mechanized system that would keep people and elephants apart.;   <PERSON>Parrott</PERSON>,
however, remains a proponent of most training.;   "Generally and under the
ideal circumstances, it is preferable to hand-raise the animal so it is not a
stress for them to be around people," he said. ". . . And it is good for them
to have things to think about -- behavioral enrichment -- and that's where
shows can come in. But if you have to discipline an animal severely to get it
to do (something), it's very questionable.";   At <ORGANIZATION>Marine World</ORGANIZATION>'s elephant
park, head trainer <PERSON>David Blasko</PERSON> says it's a matter of experience. Trainers
there have neither severely beaten the elephants nor been injured by them, he
said.;   <PERSON>Mardji</PERSON>, meanwhile, is slowly healing, thanks to daily foot care.She's
taking the equivalent of 80 human Advil a day for the pain.;   "What would
happen to <ORGANIZATION>Mardji</ORGANIZATION>'s foot if we couldn't work it every day?" asked veterinarian
<PERSON>Gage</PERSON>. "What would happen to it if were a hands-off situation?"; TRAINERS
REWARD ANIMALS FOR DESIRED BEHAVIORS;   TRAINING OF animals is simple enough
in principle, but there are plenty of ways to botch it up.;   The theory goes
like this: Through a series of trial-and-error sessions -- one Marine World
trainer compared it to the childhood game of "you're hot, you're cold" -- an
animal will eventually do something that approximates a behavior desired by a
trainer.;   The trainer will then signal the animal that it has done well,
stop the training immediately and reward the animal with food and attention
for doing the right thing. The rewards continue in subsequent sessions but
only when the animal gets closer to the desired goal. Over a series of weeks
or months, the animal masters the behavior and the verbal or physical signal
the trainer uses to elicit it.;   These simple principles can produce some
remarkable feats, such as getting an orca, or killer whale, to urinate into a
cup.;   Marine mammal trainers originally taught their whales to slide out of
a pool onto the deck as part of their performance routine. Then they noticed
that as a whale slid out of the water, it urinated involuntarily because of
the weight on its bladder.;   The trick was to make this voluntary. After some
experimentation, trainers found that if they got the whales to slide sideways
onto the deck and touched the whales in their genital area at the start of the
day, the whales would urinate (with appropriate rewards).;   Teaching the
whales to urinate on command took about a month of daily 10-minute training
sessions.;   Training doesn't always work smoothly. It can go wrong when a
trainer isn't consistent in commands or expectations, when animals are trained
too long or too hard, when they aren't trained frequently enough, when they're
asked to accomplish something they can't do and -- worst -- when they are
abused in the name of discipline, according to <PERSON>Tim Desmond</PERSON>, a behavioral
psychologist and trainer who founded the firm <ORGANIZATION>Active Environments Inc.</ORGANIZATION>;  
"Animals like sea lions and dolphins are so smart that training the trick is
<PERCENT>10 percent</PERCENT> of the effort," said <PERSON>Desmond</PERSON>. "The other <PERCENT>90 percent</PERCENT> is keeping the
animal in the frame of mind to work.";   -- <PERSON>Gerald Lanson</PERSON>  </TEXT>

   ``Because we were all expatriates and interested in the same
things, there was a real camaraderie,'' she says. But she was out
alone most days in her research vehicle following the elephants,
observing, photographing, taking notes that would later be fed into
the computer. The elephants had both descriptive names, such as
Slit Ear, and three-digit code names more palatable to computer
analysis.
   It is still a hard life. Moss suffered through bouts of malaria
and tick fever and was once badly frightened when menaced by a
black mamba, a snake whose bite is fatal.
   ``The thing I don't like about mambas is that they refuse to run
away like any other law-abiding snake,'' she says.
   She has shooed leopards away by shouting at them, endured mock
charges at her vehicle by the elephants and had her camp
``totaled'' by elephants when it was left unguarded and the smells
of fresh bananas and other delicacies overcame whatever inhibitions
they had.
   Moss found love among the elephants a remarkable process. When
bull elephants are in must _ ready to mate _ they show swollen
temporal glands on their cheeks that exude viscous liquid. The
bulls also exude a green substance from the business part of the
anatomy, which she first mistook for some kind of infection or
disease.
   She tells about a young female, a bride the first time, who
didn't know the rules after breeding with a powerful must male. A
more experienced female sticks close to her consort for three or
four days, insuring that less-powerful but greatly interested other
males keep a safe distance.
   This novice kept wandering off from the must male, drawing
instant pursuit from the lesser males, who wouldn't have ventured
close with the must male on hand. He was forced to thunder across
the plain to drive off his rivals.
   Because of the duration of her study, <PERSON>Moss</PERSON> was able to note this
female had learned proper etiquette by the time she was ready to
breed again.
   Some of the interesting tidbits, such as the fact that elephants
also communicate on an infrasonic level, are not directly from
<PERSON>Moss</PERSON>' research, but interwined with other researchers.
   Her decision to pack up and move to <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> years ago was made
easier by the fact that she had no immediate family in the <LOCATION>United
States</LOCATION> at the time. Both her parents had died and her only sister
was living in <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>.
   She wrote an earlier popular book, ``Portraits in the Wild,''
which deals with the life of a field worker. She has published her
findings in a number of scientific journals, but because she is not
professionally trained, she concedes, she may not get full respect
in some quarters.
   She holds no rancor. ``I can't apply for funds from certain
organizations. I was terribly lucky getting started the way I did.''
   Moss objects strongly to some park's practices of ``culling''
the elephants, killing part of the population to keep the numbers
under control.
   ``Elephants are not so many rodents to be exterminated; they
deserve something better than that and I am not afraid to say that
ethics and morality should be essential considerations in our
decisions for their future,'' she writes.
   ``Killing the elephants seems the simplest and most direct
solution, but only to people who have not watched individuals over
14 years; have not seen the elephants greet one another with
trumpets of joy; seen elephants, adults and calves alike, running
and playing across an open pan in the moonlight; seen elephants
trying to lift and hold up a stricken companion; seen a female
stand by her dead baby for four days; or seen a 7-year-old calf
gently fondle and stroke and feel the jaw of his dead mother.''
   ``I wrote this book,'' she says, ``to share this.''

Veterinarians at the <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> Wild Animal Park performed the first-ever 
Cesarean section on an elephant, removing a dead fetus from an Asian pachyderm 
that had been pregnant for more than two years. Surgeons spent 5 1/2 hours on 
the procedure on <ORGANIZATION>Jean</ORGANIZATION>, a 19-year-old, 7,000-pound Asian elephant that was 
believed to have been pregnant for more than 730 days. The normal gestation 
period is between 618 and 648 days. The Cesarean section was performed as a 
last resort after <PERSON>Jean</PERSON> was unable to deliver the 300-pound calf and her system 
did not abort the fetus. "To our knowledge, this has never been tried before," 
said <PERSON>Dr. Jim Oosterhuis</PERSON>, the park's director of veterinary services. "It was 
very stressful. . . . There's a good possibility that she will not be able to 
breed again and even if she were able to, we might not want to try to breed her 
to avoid problems that could occur from this procedure."

ZOO: DIRECTOR'S SUDDEN RESIGNATION HAS LITTLE IMPACT, ALTHOUGH MOST EMPLOYEES 
BELIEVE HE WAS UNFAIRLY TREATED.

The elephants were busy bathing, and the anteaters weren't talking -- but they 
rarely do. Aside from occasional sightings of zoo employees conversing in 
hushed tones about director <PERSON>Warren Thomas</PERSON>' sudden resignation, it was business 
as usual <DATE>Friday</DATE> for animals and visitors alike at the <LOCATION>Los Angeles Zoo</LOCATION>, where a 
lazy, peaceful atmosphere prevailed. 
</P>
<P>
Up along <ORGANIZATION>Bison Boulevard</ORGANIZATION>, Rhino Run and <PERSON>Gorilla Lane</PERSON>, few signs were evident of 
the controversy swirling around the <PERSON>Griffith</PERSON> Park facility, which is home to 
more than 500 species of mammals, birds and reptiles. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas announced his retirement <DATE>Friday</DATE> amid allegations by the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Department 
of Agriculture</ORGANIZATION> that the zoo had failed until three months ago to correct 
long-standing deficiencies such as inadequate sanitation and housing for the 
animals. The federal agency threatened to fine the city and revoke the zoo's 
license, and city officials launched their own probe into zoo management. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas was unavailable <DATE>Friday</DATE>, but city officials said that the 16-year veteran 
resigned because the allegations of poor management were "denigrating" to the 
zoo and to himself. 
</P>
<P>
Several zookeepers, who spoke to a reporter on the condition that they remain 
anonymous, said that <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON>' abrupt resignation angered many of them, who 
believed he was unfairly maligned. Only one keeper said he welcomed <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON>' 
departure. All, however, were emphatic on one point: Contrary to the 
allegations of dilapidated gorilla houses and dirty refrigerators for polar 
bear treats, the animals were doing just fine. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy "doesn't affect them," said <PERSON>Arlene Lettau</PERSON>, nodding toward <PERSON>Ollie</PERSON> 
and Lady, the two anteaters she tends daily. <DATE>Friday</DATE> was like any other day for 
the long-nosed mammals. Lettau nudged them awake at <TIME>9:30 a.m</TIME>. Then they waded 
into their private pool to perform their daily constitutional and just 
generally scratch around in the dirt until feeding time. 
</P>
<P>
Anteaters generally "don't say much," except when they're under stress, said 
Lettau. And on <DATE>Friday</DATE>, as on most days, all was excellent in anteater alley. 
They chowed down on a lunch of avocado mash, "bird of prey" hamburgers, cottage 
cheese and dog kibble. Ants and termites were for dessert. 
</P>
<P>
Next door, the elephants appeared equally unruffled. Ron and <PERSON>Dina Hall</PERSON>, antique 
dealers from Orange, were among the 1,100 visitors expected <DATE>Friday</DATE>. They leaned 
lazily against a rail, watching the elephants play a spirited game of 
toss-the-tire-over-the-moat. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, my God, listen to this!" said <PERSON>Dina</PERSON> as <PERSON>Billy</PERSON> and <PERSON>Becky</PERSON>, two of the zoo's 
Malaysian elephants, squealed at the sight of a rubber tire, retrieved from 
their moat by Lettau. They huddled around the tire, wrestled with it, curled 
their trunks around it, and heaved it first over the side and later into their 
swimming pool. 
</P>
<P>
"They remind me of my two sons when they were little," <PERSON>Dina</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
Taking refuge from the noon heat in a snack area was <PERSON>Ken Lichti</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Camarillo</LOCATION>, 
an amateur photographer who said he visits the zoo twice a year to take 
portraits of the animals. 
</P>
<P>
Like most visitors queried on <DATE>Friday</DATE>, <PERSON>Lichti</PERSON> knew little of the problems at the 
zoo and said he saw nothing to justify concern. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been in zoos a lot worse" than this one, he said. "This is not the <LOCATION>San 
Diego</LOCATION> Zoo" -- considered one of the world's best -- "but it's a good zoo. It's 
easy to get at and see most of the animals." 
</P>
<P>
Families leisurely strolled the grounds, unfettered by the large crowds of the 
past <DATE>summer</DATE>. Few complaints were heard, except about the seemingly omnipresent 
bees around the snack stands -- and about the scarcity of snack bars that were 
open. 
</P>
<P>
"The food is horrible, as usual," said <PERSON>Leslie Frischer</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Santa Monica</LOCATION>, who was 
heading out after a morning of animal watching with baby <PERSON>Kimberly</PERSON> strapped to 
her back and daughter <PERSON>Laura</PERSON> in a stroller.
