<LEADPARA>  Directors of the Golden Gate Bridge District on Friday boosted the toll for
cars from $2 to $3, making the new fee three times as expensive as any other
bridge toll in California.;    Directors said without the increase, they would
have to cut transit service by 50 percent and would be unable to retrofit the
54-year-old span to withstand a major earthquake.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The new toll takes effect <DATE>July 1.</DATE>;    The action brought hoots from several
residents attending the board meeting. Wearing a broach in the shape of the
Golden Gate Bridge with a tea bag hanging from it, <LOCATION>Tiburon</LOCATION> resident <PERSON>Susan
Deluxe</PERSON> told the board, "This is bad government at its worst.;    " 'I got
ripped off on my way to <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>' will become a new saying.";    Carrying
a placard that read, "Fight the <MONEY>$3</MONEY> Toll," <PERSON>Gene Pratt</PERSON> of <LOCATION>San Rafael</LOCATION> told the
board: "We will take this fight to <LOCATION>Sacramento</LOCATION>. There will be 100,000 of us
before this is over!";    Under the plan adopted by a 13-5 vote, tolls will be
<MONEY>$3</MONEY> for cars, but commuters who use discounted monthly toll books will pay
<MONEY>$2.22</MONEY>, up from <MONEY>$1.67</MONEY>. About <PERCENT>45 percent</PERCENT> of the bridge's motorists use the
advance-purchase discount tickets.;    Fares for Golden Gate Transit buses and
ferries also will increase by <PERCENT>10 percent</PERCENT> each year.;    The increased tolls
and fares are expected to raise <MONEY>$102 million</MONEY>, partly for seismic upgrading on
the bridge. Toll booths will be renovated, and an electronic toll collection
system will be installed.;    The toll increase did not come as a surprise.
The district held four public meetings in <DATE>April</DATE> and <DATE>May</DATE>, and on <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, the
board's finance committee approved the boost before submitting it to the full
panel.;    The <ORGANIZATION>Bay Area Air Quality Management District</ORGANIZATION> had urged a <MONEY>$3</MONEY> toll to
reduce the number of vehicles on the bridge. One speaker, <ORGANIZATION>Red Dodge</ORGANIZATION>, urged the
toll be raised even higher, to <MONEY>$5</MONEY>, to persuade people to take mass transit.;  
 The board's action <DATE>Friday</DATE> did not alter the current carpool policy. Cars with
three or more occupants do not pay a toll from 5 to <TIME>9 a.m.</TIME> and from 4 to <TIME>6
p.m.</TIME>;    Unlike the state's nine other toll bridges, the Golden Gate Bridge
does not come under the purview of the <ORGANIZATION>State Department of Transportation</ORGANIZATION>. Its
board is independent.;    The current one-way car toll of <MONEY>$2</MONEY> every day has
been in effect since <DATE>1988</DATE>. In <DATE>1981</DATE>, the district voted to make the toll <MONEY>$1</MONEY>
<DATE>Sunday</DATE> through <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, and <MONEY>$2</MONEY> on <DATE>Friday</DATE> and Saturday.;    When the bridge
was opened on <DATE>May 28, 1937</DATE>, the toll was <MONEY>50 cents</MONEY> each way. As the district
paid off its debt, the toll gradually dropped to <MONEY>25 cents</MONEY> each way by <DATE>1955</DATE>. In
<DATE>1968</DATE>, the district began charging tolls only on the way into <LOCATION>San Francisco.</LOCATION>;

<TEXT>
   The Golden Gate Bridge made it through the
big <DATE>1989</DATE> earthquake without any apparent damage, but bridge
directors think a <MONEY>$100 million</MONEY> quake-proofing project would be a
wise investment.
   ``Quite frankly, that's a good bargain,'' said director <PERSON>Jim
Harberson</PERSON>.
   He said replacing the 53-year-old Golden Gate would cost about
<MONEY>$1 billion</MONEY>.
   A committee of bridge directors voted <DATE>Friday</DATE> to spend <MONEY>$550,000</MONEY>
for a design study on a project that would srengthen the bridge so
it can withstand an earthquake with a Richter scale magnitude of 8
or greater.
   The retrofitting project would cost <MONEY>$75 million</MONEY> to <MONEY>$100 million</MONEY>,
and financing remains ``the big question,'' <PERSON>Harberson</PERSON> said.
   The <DATE>October 1989</DATE> earthquake registered 7.1 on the Richter scale
and claimed 67 lives. It knocked out a section of the <LOCATION>San
Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge</LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
   The threat of rush hour traffic over the
Golden Gate Bridge apparently proved too much for organizers of
<PERSON>Mikhail Gorbachev</PERSON>'s <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> tour.
   Tentative plans were scrapped <DATE>Thursday</DATE> for a <PERSON>Gorbachev</PERSON> motorcade
over the landmark span to <LOCATION>Marin County</LOCATION>.
   The Soviet leader and his wife, <PERSON>Raisa</PERSON>, will instead view the
bridge from a parking lot on the <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> side. <PERSON>Robert
Stockwell</PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION>Golden Gate Bridge District</ORGANIZATION>, is to give
the Gorbachevs a tour <DATE>Monday</DATE> of gardens near the bridge's toll plaza.
   ``We want to show them the most beautiful part of the bridge and
show them the view that millions of visitors have admired,'' he said.
   Stockwell also is to present the Gorbachevs with several bridge
mementos, including a section of the original suspension cable, a
copy of Chief Engineer <PERSON>Joseph Strauss</PERSON>'s original report on how and
why the bridge was built and a pair of sweat shirts.
   Civic leaders hope the trip will boost <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>'s economic
spirits, devastated by the <DATE>Oct. 17</DATE> earthquake.
   ``<LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> has been feeling some of the downturn in business
ever since the earthquake,'' Chamber of <ORGANIZATION>Commerce</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON>Carol
Piasente</PERSON> said. ``Having <PERSON>Gorbachev</PERSON> visit is a great boost to the
local economy.''
   At <ORGANIZATION>Stanford</ORGANIZATION>, the post office plans to issue a special envelope
<DATE>Monday</DATE> commemorating the <PERSON>Gorbachev</PERSON> visit with a special cancellation
design featuring <PERSON>Gorbachev</PERSON>'s face above the word ``Stanford,''
written in Cyrillic alphabet.
   At <ORGANIZATION>City Hall</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, the Soviet flag will be flying.
Mayor Art Agnos, joined by Soviet Consul General <PERSON>Valentin Kamenev</PERSON>
and the city's chief of protocol, <LOCATION>Charlotte</LOCATION> Mailliard Swig, planned
to raise the flag today off the balcony of the mayor's office.
   ``There's a great deal of excitement about the visit,'' said <PERSON>Ms.
Piasente</PERSON> said. ``We're fielding hundreds of phone calls.''
   While <PERSON>Gorbachev</PERSON> meets with <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> business leaders, <PERSON>Mrs.
Gorbachev</PERSON> will take a separate tour of the city <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME>,
traveling by motorcade to <LOCATION>Golden Gate Park</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>War Memorial Opera
House</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Davies Symphony Hall</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>Bank of America</ORGANIZATION> building and
Fisherman's Wharf.
   Earlier plans to include the Civic Center, where dozens of
homeless people have been living for months, were dropped.
   The Gorbachevs' whirlwind tour _ arriving in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> <DATE>Sunday</DATE>
<TIME>night</TIME> and leaving <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME> _ will include a bit of
socializing.
   Four members of a group called ``Friends of <PERSON>Raisa Gorbachev</PERSON>''
were scheduled to meet with <PERSON>Mrs. Gorbachev</PERSON> at the Soviet consul
general's residence for a ``nonpolitical, people-to-people''
conversation.

<PERSON>Lissa Collins-Gudim</PERSON>, 28, was halfway across the Golden Gate Bridge, heading 
toward <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> from a house-hunting trip to <LOCATION>Sonoma</LOCATION> with her husband, <PERSON>Tim</PERSON>, 
when it began. 
</P>
<P>
"The first thing I thought was maybe we'd lost all four tires," said the 
<LOCATION>Pacific Palisades</LOCATION> resident. "All of a sudden, the guy driving us, the real 
estate broker, said: 'Oh, my God! We're having an earthquake!' And then it got 
worse. 
</P>
<P>
"The bridge was swaying . . . . The next thing that happened is that it began 
waving. It fanned, sort of. The cables -- the little ones that go up and down 
-- were like spaghetti. The big ones, those big fat ones, they were moving from 
side to side, six feet in either direction." 
</P>
<P>
Brake lights flared. Cars screeched to a halt, each driver trying to avoid the 
next. Across the bay in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, a huge column of dust arose from the 
collapsed buildings in the <LOCATION>Marina District</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
On the Golden Gate, the swaying lasted 40 to 50 seconds, Collins-Gudim 
estimated, nearly three times the elapsed time of the actual quake. 
</P>
<P>
"I just thought I was never going to see my kids again," she said. "I had my 
hand on the car door. If we were going to fall in the water, I didn't want to 
drown." CATHLEEN DECKER

The way <PERSON>Jim Sawyer</PERSON> figures it, the collapse of a 50-foot length of the Bay 
Bridge may have begun with a two-cent rivet. <PERSON>Sawyer</PERSON> has made a career of 
designing and examining bridges, and he is sure that the seismic blast from the 
earthquake snapped a row of rivets and caused a patch of concrete five lanes 
wide to give way on the top deck of the Bay Bridge. 
</P>
<P>
The falling slab pierced the traffic lanes on the lower deck, exposing daylight 
and the chilly bay waters 250 feet below. Two cars wedged by the falling debris 
teetered on the edge of the damaged roadway. Initial reports said some 
motorists jumped into the water, but the <ORGANIZATION>Coast Guard</ORGANIZATION> said there is no evidence 
of that. 
</P>
<P>
It was a staggering scene, one that framed the disaster for a nation that had 
tuned in to watch Game 3 of the World Series only to see live pictures of a 
stricken bridge. 
</P>
<P>
And <PERSON>Sawyer</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Tampa Bay</LOCATION> civil engineer watching on television in <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, could 
not help but think about the rivets that join the huge concrete panels on the 
bridge. 
</P>
<P>
"It was probably a connection failure, right about where the rivets sit," 
<PERSON>Sawyer</PERSON> said. "Chances are it wouldn't happen in a hundred years. Those rivets 
are routinely inspected." 
</P>
<P>
But <PERSON>Sawyer</PERSON> and other structural experts who watched the quake's flattening 
power say it is impossible to examine each joint, each beam and each rivet. 
</P>
<P>
"Truth is you can't go over it with a microscope," <PERSON>Sawyer</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
In time, <ORGANIZATION>Caltrans</ORGANIZATION> officials will eyeball, photograph, measure and note what 
happened to the failed link of the Bay Bridge and draw conclusions as to the 
cause. And they will undoubtedly ponder why the Golden Gate Bridge, the more 
glamorous of the twin spans that link <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> with its bayside neighbors, 
weathered the shake with little more than a superficial crack or two. 
</P>
<P>
One theory advanced by experts focuses on the inability of the Bay Bridge to 
bend or give when struck sideways by the powerful ground waves generated by the 
temblor. As evidence, the roadway collapse occurred along one of the bridge's 
most rigid sections. 
</P>
<P>
"The bridge didn't give. It broke," said one structural engineer, who requested 
anonymity because he has a contract with the state. "It was more like a stick 
that snapped than a rubber band that stretched. That jolt may have displaced 
the bridge as much as a foot before that section went." 
</P>
<P>
State highway officials have declined to speculate, saying it is too soon to 
know what caused the bridge failure. <ORGANIZATION>Caltrans</ORGANIZATION> has spent <MONEY>$58 million</MONEY> since the 
<DATE>1971</DATE> Sylmar earthquake to strengthen and upgrade 1,500 bridges in quake-prone 
areas, including the <LOCATION>Bay Area</LOCATION>. Among the retrofitted structures was the <LOCATION>Bay 
Bridge</LOCATION>, where crews retied the bridge decks to column supports, <ORGANIZATION>Caltrans</ORGANIZATION> 
spokeswoman <PERSON>Lisa Covington</PERSON> said. A second <MONEY>$64-million</MONEY> phase to reinforce more 
than 700 bridge columns and supports statewide should be completed by <DATE>1992</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
"Some retrofitting of the Bay Bridge has been done, but what sections had been 
worked on is unclear," <PERSON>Covington</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Jim McCarty</PERSON> believes the busted bridge may have had more to do with geography 
than concrete patch jobs. The Bay Bridge, built during the Depression, runs 
east and west, tying <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION> with <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>. When the quake hit, it sent a 
powerful ground swell north from its epicenter near <LOCATION>Santa Cruz</LOCATION> toward the Bay 
Bridge, said <PERSON>McCarty</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION>'s public works director for two decades. 
</P>
<P>
The Bay Bridge incorporates three engineering styles, with the <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION> side of 
the bridge supported by metal trusses. Unlike the Golden Gate Bridge or even 
the <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> side of the Bay Bridge, both of which are supported by cables 
that give when rocked by a quake, metal trusses tend to be more resistant to 
movement, <PERSON>McCarty</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, when the quake's powerful groundswell broadsided the bridge, a chunk of 
the upper deck collapsed, <PERSON>McCarty</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
The Golden Gate Bridge, which opened a year after the Bay Bridge, was spared 
because it was perpendicular to ground motion. The Golden Gate's roadbed, 
resting in a massive sling of cables and span, swayed with the 15-second shake 
but survived intact. 
</P>
<P>
"A truss bridge is much more rigid, much less forgiving," <PERSON>McCarty</PERSON> said. "The TV 
pictures showed us that." 
</P>
<P>
The section of bridge that failed is over a pier support, and <PERSON>McCarty</PERSON> said he 
believes that the columns supporting the roadway "separated ever so slightly, 
and boom, the concrete gave way." 
</P>
<P>
Moments after it happened, <PERSON>Thomas Kelly</PERSON> was driving his camper on the bridge's 
upper deck, trying to return to <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>. Then, as he videotaped the 
confusion among rattled motorists around him, he witnessed a car falling 
through the crevice in the roadway. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a moment frozen in my mind," said <PERSON>Kelly</PERSON>, an Oklahoman who was vacationing 
in the <LOCATION>Bay Area</LOCATION> with his wife, <PERSON>Debbie</PERSON>. "One minute the car was there. The next 
it was gone. I really thought we were next. I thought the entire bridge was 
going." 
</P>
<P>
The Golden Gate remained opened, and after several closures to inspect joints 
and seams, the <LOCATION>San Mateo Bridge</LOCATION> was declared safe and passable for motorists 
fewer than 24 hours after the quake. 
</P>
<P>
Reopening the Bay Bridge, traveled daily by half a million motorists, is less 
certain. 
</P>
<P>
A large marine crane moved into place <DATE>Thursday</DATE> below the wounded structure to 
lift the downed section bridge in an attempt to assess the damage. Officials 
also considered spanning the gap with steel girders called <ORGANIZATION>Bailey Bridges</ORGANIZATION>, a 
World War II innovation to move tanks and heavy equipment across waterways. 
</P>
<P>
It is a temporary fix, at best, and one <ORGANIZATION>Caltrans</ORGANIZATION> official said rather than 
putting a "Band-Aid on the hurt, we'd like to fix it right." But that could 
mean it will be several weeks before the toll bridge is open again for 
business. 
</P>
<P>
"That bridge has done a damn good job for 50 years," said <PERSON>McCarty</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Bay Area</LOCATION> 
resident for most of his life. "Until it's reopened, life just won't be the 
same."

<LEADPARA>  A proposal to raise tolls on the Golden Gate Bridge to $3 has roiled this
normally serene enclave and brought a wave of rhetoric more recently heard on
the lips of Soviet dissidents.;    Bridge directors "defy the will of the
people . . . and we have no recourse," complained Gene Prat, one leader of a
group called Marin United Taxpayers Association. "It's undemocratic and
contrary to everything in this country. It's an atrocity."  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  $3 'ATROCITY': A TOLL TOO FAR?
GOLDEN GATE PLAN WOULD BE 2ND $1 PRICE HIKE
IN 2 YEARS  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  See also related story on P. 2B of this section  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     The <MONEY>$1</MONEY> price hike would be the second in <DATE>two years.</DATE>;    The Golden Gate
bridge district says tolls have to be raised to cover a projected <MONEY>$14 million</MONEY>
deficit. The additional money is needed to make the bridge earthquake-safe and
to stanch financial losses from the bus and ferry lines that provide the only
alternative to air-polluting cars, says <PERSON>Carney Campion</PERSON>, the district's general
manager.;    With such seemingly solid reasons for a price hike, one has to
ask: Is a dollar more per day really going to prove a hardship for residents
of the <LOCATION>Bay Area</LOCATION>'s wealthiest county?;    <ORGANIZATION>Marin</ORGANIZATION> protesters brush aside such
queries and say that the issue is really one of democratic rights.;    "This
is taxation without representation," Prat said.;    In fact, the <LOCATION>Golden Gate</LOCATION>
bridge district is something of a political anomaly in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>. It runs the
only toll bridge in the state not operated by <ORGANIZATION>Caltrans</ORGANIZATION>. And its 19-member
board is appointed by six member counties according to a complex formula that
has preserved, even through several changes, its "north-south" balance.;   
That balance means <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> gets nine seats on the board, although
everyone acknowledges that the majority of bridge users are <LOCATION>Marin County</LOCATION>
residents.;    <ORGANIZATION>Board</ORGANIZATION> members serve at the pleasure of the appointing body --
usually county supervisors or other elected officials -- and many have served
lengthy terms. One, <PERSON>L.E. Castner</PERSON>, a retired insurance executive from <LOCATION>Boyes Hot
Springs</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Sonoma County</LOCATION>, has been on the board since <DATE>1952.</DATE>;    The district's
six counties -- <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Marin</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Sonoma</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Napa</LOCATION>, Mendocino and <ORGANIZATION>Del Norte</ORGANIZATION> --
are the ones that pledged their residents' personal property to guarantee a
bond issue of <MONEY>$35 million</MONEY> to build the bridge, which was completed -- without
a nickel of federal or state money -- in <DATE>1937</DATE>. The bridge was completely paid
off by <DATE>1971</DATE>, which is just around the time the district asked the Legislature
to allow it to begin running bus and ferry lines for commuters.;    One
commuter on board;  Mill Valley Mayor <PERSON>Richard Spotswood</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>
attorney who is the only board member to regularly commute over the bridge,
understands the frustration of fellow <LOCATION>Marin County</LOCATION> residents.;    "<LOCATION>Marin
County</LOCATION> is not asking anyone to feel sorry for it," said <LOCATION>Spotswood</LOCATION>, who admits
he drives a Mercedes most days rather than taking the bus across the bridge.
"It would just like to control its own destiny.";    But he also notes that a
directly elected board -- a prime goal of the taxpayers group -- would, if
based on population, leave <LOCATION>Marin County</LOCATION> with even fewer representatives than
the four it now has.;    "It's a quandary," <LOCATION>Spotswood</LOCATION> said.;    About 124,000
cars cross the graceful, 1.7-mile span every day, while a fleet of 270 buses
carries 28,000 commuters and four ferries ply an additional 4,000 across the
bay. Carpools -- about 1,000 a day -- cross free of charge.;    Revenues
shrink;  To a certain extent, the district's success in persuading drivers to
give up their cars for mass transit has hurt its finances, manager <PERSON>Campion</PERSON>
said. A <MONEY>$125 million</MONEY> price tag for earthquake improvements -- even with <PERCENT>80
percent</PERCENT> expected from federal sources -- has only deepened the district's
financial woes.;    It's widely expected that the board will approve the <MONEY>$3</MONEY>
toll later this week, with rate hikes effective <DATE>July 1</DATE>. But the real political
tussle will come over discount rates for commuters -- which now stand at <MONEY>$1.67</MONEY>
but may rise significantly.;    "The average person in <LOCATION>Marin</LOCATION> says <MONEY>$3</MONEY> is a lot
for a toll," <LOCATION>Spotswood</LOCATION> said. "You can give them good reasons but it still just
seems like a lot."  </TEXT>

GALES, WILD WAVES, RAIN -- MISERY

Their misery compounded by soaking rain and bone-chilling winds, hundreds of 
thousands of <LOCATION>Bay Area</LOCATION> commuters struggled to work aboard the remaining links of 
the earthquake-ravaged transportation system today. Conditions across the area 
were crowded and chaotic, but mass gridlock was avoided. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got gale winds, heavy rains and heavy traffic -- your basic nightmare 
conditions," said <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> Highway Patrol Officer <PERSON>John Lash</PERSON>. "Somebody up 
there doesn't like us." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Bruce Selby</PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION>Golden Gate Bridge District</ORGANIZATION>, said officials 
there were "absolutely amazed that things are going so smoothly." 
</P>
<P>
"People are turning to mass transit, he said. "Our buses and ferries are 
running at double and triple the normal level." 
</P>
<P>
But "smoothly" was still only relative. Neophyte riders of the <ORGANIZATION>Bay Area Rapid 
Transit District</ORGANIZATION> subway were drenched while waiting for cars that carried them, 
sardine-like, from the <LOCATION>East Bay</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>. An armada of ferryboats 
braved squalls and rough seas to deliver their seasick passengers to <LOCATION>San 
Francisco</LOCATION> piers. To the south near the epicenter of <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>'s quake, <LOCATION>Santa Cruz 
County</LOCATION> travelers made their way to work on Highway 17 thanks to a fleet of <ORGANIZATION>CHP</ORGANIZATION> 
escorts. 
</P>
<P>
In <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> announced that President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> will 
seek <MONEY>$2.5 billion</MONEY> in new federal aid for earthquake victims -- a figure well 
below that sought by congressional Democrats who were working on a relief 
package. Estimates of the actual cost of damages continued to mount, exceeding 
<MONEY>$6.6 billion</MONEY> at last count. 
</P>
<P>
The <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> coroner added two more victims to the list of confirmed dead, 
bringing that tally to 61. Another 52 people were officially missing and 
believed trapped in the yet-uncleared wreckage of the <ORGANIZATION>Nimitz Freeway</ORGANIZATION> in 
<LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION>. Officials in <LOCATION>Santa Cruz</LOCATION> also launched a search for a man believed to 
have been trapped in a landslide on <DATE>Sunday</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Bay Area workers, returning en masse to work for the first time since <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>'s 
6.9 temblor, were forced onto BART trains, ferries and roundabout freeways 
because of the collapse of the <ORGANIZATION>Nimitz Freeway</ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION>San Francisco-Oakland Bay 
Bridge</LOCATION>. Authorities were also forced to close I-280 and <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>'s 
Embarcadero Freeway because of threatening cracks. 
</P>
<P>
By <TIME>10:30 a.m.</TIME>, BART had carried 99,732 passengers, compared to an average of 
69,638 on a normal weekday. Two passengers fainted after getting off trains at 
the <ORGANIZATION>Embarcadero Station</ORGANIZATION> after crossing the bay. 
</P>
<P>
"They were hyperventilating, I guess from being nervous in the tube," said 
<PERSON>Debby Tudor</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Westinghouse Elevator</ORGANIZATION> technician dispatched to tend to the 
station's escalators. 
</P>
<P>
But traffic from the northern suburbs over the Golden Gate Bridge was fast and 
smooth. And the morning commute on Highway 101 from the southern suburbs began 
light -- but then the freeway flooded. 
</P>
<P>
"Mother Nature is having a field day with us," commuter <PERSON>Joyce Bustinduy</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
At sea, it was even rougher. Hundreds of commuters -- many afraid of traveling 
in the under-bay BART tube -- sought to make their way to work aboard ferries, 
but found the boats crowded and the seas wild.

<LEADPARA>  An engineering firm has recommended a series of improvements to enable the
Golden Gate Bridge to survive a major earthquake. T.Y. Lin International of
San Francisco recommended strengthening the structure and "tuning" it to make
it less prone to shaking. The project is expected to take five years.
Preliminary cost estimate is $125 million. These are among the key quake
recommendations:; (box)Bridge towers: Strengthen the 746-foot twin steel
spires that form each tower, the struts that connect them, the saddles on top
that hold the main cables and the reinforced concrete piers supporting the
towers. Rebuild connections to roadway supports.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>  (box)Pylons: Strengthen the concrete pylons at each end of the bridge,
anchoring them securely to bedrock, and anchor the steel tie-downs that hold
the bridge's main cables to bedrock.; (box)Viaducts leading to bridge: At both
ends, strengthen the towers and piers that support the roadway trusses, and
the trusses themselves, and install bearings designed to isolate the trusses
from earthquake motion. At the <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> end, install shock-absorbing
units in the <LOCATION>Fort Point</LOCATION> arch at far left to dissipate the earthquake's energy.  </TEXT>

<P>
The excitement surrounding Soviet President <PERSON>Mikhail S. Gorbachev</PERSON>'s upcoming 
visit here was tempered <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> with the release of his wife's itinerary and 
news that the Gorbachevs hope to visit the Golden Gate Bridge -- at rush hour. 
</P>
<P>
To ensure security, Golden Gate Bridge officials and the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> Highway 
Patrol plan to slow traffic on the heavily traveled bridge while the Gorbachevs 
and their 30-car motorcade make their way across, sometime between <TIME>4 p.m.</TIME> and <TIME>7 
p.m.</TIME> <DATE>Monday</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier that afternoon, <PERSON>Raisa Gorbachev</PERSON> is tentatively scheduled to go on an 
hour-long tour of the city, viewing some of <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>'s finest sights and 
some of its most blighted and tacky. 
</P>
<P>
"Talk about abominations," one <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> native involved in the planning 
sniffed upon hearing that <PERSON>Raisa Gorbachev</PERSON> will visit touristy Fisherman's 
Wharf. 
</P>
<P>
The itinerary released by <ORGANIZATION>PBN Co.</ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> public relations firm that 
is coordinating aspects of the visit, shows that her entourage apparently will 
bypass such monuments to Western consumerism as <ORGANIZATION>Union Square</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"<PERSON>I. Magnin</PERSON> said at one point they would close the entire store if she wanted to 
shop there. But she's not going to (<ORGANIZATION>Nordstrom</ORGANIZATION>). She's not going to go to <PERSON>I. 
Magnin</PERSON>," said <PERSON>Staci Walters</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>PBN</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
After spending the morning with her husband at <ORGANIZATION>Stanford University</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Mrs. 
Gorbachev</PERSON> will take her tour. She probably will be escorted by <PERSON>Tatyana Kamenev</PERSON>, 
wife of the Soviet consul general, and perhaps <PERSON>Sherry Agnos</PERSON>, wife of Mayor Art 
Agnos, said <ORGANIZATION>Charlotte Mailliard Swig</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>'s chief of protocol. 
</P>
<P>
"They won't have much time, but I think she'll like it and come back," Swig 
said. "I just hope they don't stop in Civic Plaza." 
</P>
<P>
Her itinerary will include a trip to <LOCATION>Golden Gate Park</LOCATION>, perhaps a stop at a 
museum, and a visit to Civic Center, locale of <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>'s ornate City <PERSON>Hall</PERSON> 
and home to hundreds of homeless people who camp in the plaza there. <LOCATION>San 
Francisco</LOCATION> has been sprucing up the plaza in recent months, but does not plan to 
relocate the residents. 
</P>
<P>
"It is part of life," Art <PERSON>Silverman</PERSON>, spokesman for Mayor Agnos, said of the 
tent dwellers in the plaza outside <LOCATION>City Hall</LOCATION>. "It is our own glasnost policy, 
you might say. We're not going to try to hide anything." 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's great," said <PERSON>Warden Coleman</PERSON>, 33, who has been living in the plaza 
for three months with his dog, Lady. The out-of-work bartender put down his 
book -- a spy novel -- and pointed out that if <PERSON>Mrs. Gorbachev</PERSON> drives by or 
stops at the plaza, "she'll get to see that her country isn't the only one 
having trouble." 
</P>
<P>
The tentative schedule also has <PERSON>Mrs. Gorbachev</PERSON> heading to the heart of the 
city's financial district, stopping at the 52-story <ORGANIZATION>Bank of America</ORGANIZATION> building, 
then going on to Fisherman's Wharf. 
</P>
<P>
While she tours <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, her husband is scheduled to speak to business 
and political leaders at the <ORGANIZATION>Fairmont Hotel</ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> police spokesman 
<PERSON>David Ambrose</PERSON> said he expects that the largest demonstration of the Soviets' 
<LOCATION>West Coast</LOCATION> stop will take place outside the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Southern <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> representatives of ethnic Armenian, Latvian, Estonian and 
Lithuanian groups said several busloads of demonstrators will arrive <DATE>Monday</DATE> 
from such locales as <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Santa Ana</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Fresno</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"There won't be a shortage of Baltic flags flying around," said <PERSON>Jaak Treiman</PERSON>, a 
<LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> attorney of Estonian extraction. 
</P>
<P>
At the Fairmont, <PERSON>Gorbachev</PERSON> reportedly is planning to acknowledge Gov. <PERSON>George 
Deukmejian</PERSON>'s relief efforts on behalf of victims of the Armenian earthquake in 
<DATE>1988</DATE>. <PERSON>Deukmejian</PERSON>, who is of Armenian descent, has said he does not know if he 
will have a chance to speak privately with the Soviet leader. 
</P>
<P>
If given the opportunity, the governor added, he will tell <PERSON>Gorbachev</PERSON> that 
Armenians in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> "hope <PERSON>Mr. Gorbachev</PERSON> and his government would 
take steps to ensure greater protection for Armenian people living there, and 
greater assistance to help them to rebuild from the devastating earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
After the Fairmont speech, <PERSON>Gorbachev</PERSON> will return to the Soviet consul general's 
home, meet with his wife, and head to the Golden Gate Bridge. 
</P>
<P>
Officer <PERSON>Bill Wylie</PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION>CHP</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Marin County</LOCATION>, said the Gorbachevs 
tentatively plan to cross the bridge and get out of their cars at the vista 
point on the <ORGANIZATION>Marin</ORGANIZATION> side. After gazing upon the <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> skyline for about 
15 minutes, they will return to their cars for the drive to <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> and 
the airport. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very happy that he's coming to view our area and our bridge," <PERSON>Wylie</PERSON> 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But feelings of peace and goodwill aside, the sightseeing excursion is likely 
to take its toll on the <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>evening</TIME> commute across the Golden Gate. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Wylie</PERSON> said at the minimum, the <ORGANIZATION>CHP</ORGANIZATION> will slow traffic, and "they could shut down 
the bridge for a minute," while <PERSON>Gorbachev</PERSON> and his entourage cross the span. At 
rush hour, 6,000 cars an hour head north from <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Marin</LOCATION> across the 
bridge. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't think the motorcade itself will impact traffic as much as people 
wanting to get a view of the President of the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>," <PERSON>Wylie</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
Golden Gate Bridge officials say the 25-minute operation -- 15 minutes at the 
vista point and 10 minutes for the round-trip drive -- will not result in 
gridlock. 
</P>
<P>
"People in this area stay clear when they know there's going to be a major 
event. They go home early or they stay late," said <PERSON>Carney Campion</PERSON>, manager of 
the bridge. 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writer <PERSON>Doug Smith</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Glendale</LOCATION> contributed to this story.

   Traffic flowed smoothly on <DATE>Monday</DATE>, the
first workday since the quake-battered Bay Bridge reopened, but
officials said Thanksgiving week could be the cause and suggested
the real crunch could come next week.
   The doctor who cared for Buck Helm, the longshoreman who
survived 3{ days in his car in a collapsed section of Interstate
880, said his death <DATE>Saturday</DATE> was partly due to a heart condition
they had been unaware of.
   However, <PERSON>Dr. Tom McDonald</PERSON>, chief of surgery at <ORGANIZATION>Kaiser Permanente
Medical Center</ORGANIZATION>, told a news conference in <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION> that Helm
suffered ``overwhelming'' injuries in the freeway collapse that
claimed 41 other lives.
   In all, the <DATE>Oct. 17</DATE> quake killed 67 people, injured more than
2,800, left more than 14,000 homeless and inflicted an estimated <MONEY>$7
billion</MONEY> damage.
   The quake sent a 50-foot section of the <LOCATION>San Francisco-Oakland
Bay Bridge</LOCATION>'s upper deck crashing onto the lower deck, cutting the
main link between <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION>. The 8.5-mile-long span
formally reopened <DATE>Friday</DATE>.
   Traffic <DATE>Monday</DATE> on the bridge was running <PERCENT>50 percent</PERCENT> less than
<DATE>Oct. 17</DATE>, said Lt. <PERSON>Jim Simmons</PERSON> of the state <ORGANIZATION>Department of
Transportation</ORGANIZATION>, who is toll supervisor at the bridge. Before the
quake, an average of 260,000 cars used the bridge each day.
   ``Obviously, people are still taking mass transit and coming in
earlier,'' said <PERSON>Greg Bayol</PERSON>, a spokesman for the state <ORGANIZATION>Department of
Transportation</ORGANIZATION>. ``The test will come later, this being a holiday
week.''
   Traffic also was down on the Golden Gate Bridge, which handles
traffic southbound into the city. It is used along with the
<ORGANIZATION>Richmond-San Rafael Bridge</ORGANIZATION> by commuters from bedroom communities to
the east.
   From <TIME>6 a.m.</TIME> to <TIME>8 a.m.</TIME>, 14,086 cars used the span, down from
17,634 for the same period a week ago, said Capt. <PERSON>Jackson Fong</PERSON> of
the <ORGANIZATION>Golden Gate Bridge District</ORGANIZATION>. The Golden Gate handles about
146,000 cars daily.
   The Bay Area Rapid Transit system, which set records almost
every day while the Bay Bridge was closed, carried about <PERCENT>20 percent</PERCENT>
fewer passengers during the morning commute than a week ago. By
<TIME>8:30 a.m.</TIME>, the system had transported 65,239 passengers, compared
to 78,003 the previous <DATE>Monday</DATE>, said <ORGANIZATION>BART</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>Sy Mouber</PERSON>.
   However, <PERSON>Mouber</PERSON> pointed out that BART carried just 47,415
passengers on <DATE>Oct. 5</DATE>, making <DATE>Monday</DATE>'s load <PERCENT>118 percent</PERCENT> of that
before the quake.
   Asked if these figures meant people have permanently changed the
way they commute, <PERSON>Mouber</PERSON> said, ``I don't think we are seeing the
results yet. I think people are taking an early Thanksgiving
holiday.''
   ``Next week may look a little different,'' said <PERSON>Mike Mills</PERSON>, a
spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION>Alameda Contra Costa Counties Transit System</ORGANIZATION>,
which runs public buses.
   The number of passengers taking <ORGANIZATION>AC Transit</ORGANIZATION> buses across the
bridge on routes beginning in <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION> and Alameda appeared to be
down, <PERSON>Mills</PERSON> said.
   The number of people riding a ferry from <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>San
Francisco</LOCATION> was also down, according to the <ORGANIZATION>Red &amp; White Fleet</ORGANIZATION>.
Between <TIME>6 a.m. and 9 a.m.</TIME>, there were 1,165 passengers, a drop of
472 from last <DATE>Monday</DATE>.
   According to the <ORGANIZATION>Alameda County Coroner's Office</ORGANIZATION>, Helm died of
blunt trauma to his head and body, respiratory failure due to
extensive chest injuries, kidney failure and abdominal infection.
   Before the quake, Helm, 58, had high blood pressure and diabetes.
   Doctors learned after Helm's death that he had an enlarged
ventricle, the chamber of the heart that pumps blood into the
arteries, <ORGANIZATION>McDonald</ORGANIZATION> told reporters. McDonald said it had not been
possible for doctors to know about the heart problem.
   The surgeon said he had been looking forward to taking Helm off
the respirator that kept the longshoreman breathing, and was as
shocked by anyone by his death. ``We had all been so encouraged,''
<ORGANIZATION>McDonald</ORGANIZATION> said.

<HL> Golden Gate Bridge
Has Troubled Waters
For Its Birthday Bash

Squabbling of Rival Groups
Frightens Away Sponsors;
A Job for a Protocol Chief

<TEXT>
   Citizen watchdog groups have been formed. 
One man calls it the biggest scandal here in 20 years. 
His opponent deems him "nasty and defaming." 
The mayor has stepped in. 
Sabotage and conspiracy charges are fired. 

   This is serious. 
<LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> is trying to throw a party. 

   The Golden Gate Bridge, one of the world's loveliest ways to cross water, turns 50 next month, and tourist-conscious <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> plans a birthday bash <DATE>May 24</DATE>. 
But as the big day approaches, sponsors are scarce, organizers are about <MONEY>$800,000</MONEY> in debt, and plans have shown all the smooth coordination of Donnybrook Fair. 

   Even for a city that loves a good time, the initial plans for a <MONEY>$22 million</MONEY> extravaganza struck some as a bit overblown. (The 100th-anniversary celebration for the <LOCATION>Brooklyn</LOCATION> Bridge in <DATE>May 1983</DATE> cost about <MONEY>$3 million</MONEY>). 
Some party-poopers even suggested the money might be better spent on the needy. 
San <ORGANIZATION>Francisco Examiner</ORGANIZATION> columnist <PERSON>Bill Mandel</PERSON> wrote, "In money matters, the {bridge} district exhibits the self-control of a 22-year-old rock star with a bad coke habit." 

   Two rival groups vied to be the main merrymakers and planned competing concerts, fireworks and parades. 
Each camp charges the other has torpedoed its fund raising and events. 
The chaos has caused corporate sponsors to back off. 

   Such disarray is surprising in a haven of seasoned socializers. 
In <DATE>May</DATE> alone, <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> will have a citywide ball for 12,000 people and the annual Bay to Breakers footrace, the world's largest and wildest, with 100,000 joggers dressed as bowling pins or bananas or pulling kegs of beer. 

   Most <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> bridges are state-run, but the Golden Gate is run by the Golden Gate Bridge, Highway and <ORGANIZATION>Transportation District</ORGANIZATION>, a group of political appointees, and financed by tolls. 
Several members of the group are members of the party committee, known as the Friends of the Golden Gate Bridge. 

   Early on, the bridge bash hit troubled waters. 
The chief fund-raising firm was let go because its task became impossible, an organizer says. 
The events director stepped down. 
A man hired to provide entertainment died shortly afterward. 
At an unveiling of party plans, a map of the Bay area was upside down and an out-of-state organizer told the <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> audience, "You <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> people are going to love this!" 

   <PERSON>James Bronkema</PERSON>, the chairman of the Friends, admits, "I could write a book on the mistakes." 
But he blames the local press, too, for making fun of the party. 
He notes that over half the original <MONEY>$22 million</MONEY> budget was for the long-term goal of a museum. 
And he says of rebel reveler <PERSON>Scott Redmond</PERSON>, whose <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> firm produces special events, "Our competitor has been undermining our sponsorship very badly." 

   <PERSON>Mr. Bronkema</PERSON> says <PERSON>Mr. Redmond</PERSON> had a "religious fervor" to have the party. 
"He can have anything he wants, except the bridge. 
After all, that's ours." 

   The bridge directors declined the help of <PERSON>Mr. Redmond</PERSON>, who has staged an outdoor party for 250,000 people, tied the world's largest bow around a hotel, and landed a flying saucer in a corporate board room. 
<PERSON>Mr. Redmond</PERSON> accuses the Friends of sabotage conducted in "the most nasty, heinous way possible" and of seeking political gain. 

   A group called <ORGANIZATION>Citizens for Bridge District Reform</ORGANIZATION> has sent out letters charging that some of the festive doings are part of "<PERSON>David Rockefeller</PERSON>'s overall plan to, figuratively, buy the bridge" and win political favors in order to build a <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>. 

   The reference is to <PERSON>James Bronkema</PERSON>'s role as president of <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>'s big Embarcadero Center office and shopping complex. 
Embarcadero Center, owned by <PERSON>David Rockefeller</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Prudential Insurance</ORGANIZATION>, donated <MONEY>$250,000</MONEY> to the celebration. 
<PERSON>Mr. Bronkema</PERSON> calls the charges ludicrous and says the donation was "part of our civic duty." 

   Rock promotor <PERSON>Bill Graham</PERSON> volunteered to stage a free show featuring <PERSON>Huey Lewis</PERSON> and the News and the Grateful Dead, two bands with local roots. 
He wanted the bridge closed during the Sunday-afternoon concert to "let her breathe." 
The folks in wealthy <LOCATION>Marin County</LOCATION>, on the other end of the bridge, protested, so <PERSON>Mr. Graham</PERSON> has canceled. 
But he is frustrated. 
"I feel like I'm tied up with rope, having to watch <PERSON>Ava Gardner</PERSON> parade back and forth in front of me." 

   <PERSON>Joyce Pavlovsky</PERSON>, a member of a citizens' group called Bridgewatch, says <PERSON>Marinites</PERSON> fear medical emergencies if the bridge is closed, not to mention the inconvenience. 
"It's going to be such a mess," she says. 
"This is not an occasion for fun." 

   <PERSON>Herb Caen</PERSON>, the columnist for the <LOCATION>San Francisco Chronicle</LOCATION>, riled some by asking why "the spoiled brats in Marin" couldn't stand being out of their BMWs for a few hours. 
<PERSON>Mr. Caen</PERSON>, one of 200,000 who walked across the bridge the day it opened, also wrote that rock music has little to do with the bridge. 
<PERSON>Mr. Graham</PERSON> responded to <PERSON>Mr. Caen</PERSON>'s opinion by calling him "an amoeba filled with pus." 

   With plans going badly awry, organizers belatedly brought in <LOCATION>Charlotte</LOCATION> "Tex" <ORGANIZATION>Mailliard</ORGANIZATION>, a wealthy widow renowned as a party thrower and the city's acting chief of protocol. 
<PERSON>Mrs. Mailliard</PERSON>, who served Cheerios to 10,000 people at a farewell breakfast for the queen of <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>, threw a citywide celebration for the cable cars, shot off fireworks inside city hall and enlisted the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION>'s aid in baking the world's largest birthday cake to mark <ORGANIZATION>Beethoven</ORGANIZATION>'s birthday, is known to stay and sweep up after her affairs. 

   "I never would have forgiven myself if there wasn't a celebration for the bridge," <PERSON>Mrs. Mailliard</PERSON> says. 
The bridge can be viewed from many places in her home, including the shower. 

   <PERSON>Mrs. Mailliard</PERSON> enlisted the aid of Mayor <PERSON>Dianne Feinstein</PERSON>. 
The city donated <MONEY>$100,000</MONEY>, and the mayor has been successfully urging corporations to make "modest" contributions. 
Although the party has been "one controversy after another," Mayor <PERSON>Feinstein</PERSON> concedes, "controversy is an everyday part of life here." 

   Plans of the <ORGANIZATION>Friends</ORGANIZATION> committee now include a dawn walk across the bridge, <PERSON>Tony Bennett</PERSON> singing again about his misplaced heart, fireworks, new lighting for the bridge and a performance by a marching band from <LOCATION>Pottstown</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pa.</LOCATION>, the city that made the steel for the bridge. 
The current budget is about <MONEY>$3 million</MONEY>, including in-kind contributions. 
The group <PERSON>Mr. Redmond</PERSON> works with plans art shows, whaleboat races and a stamp-cancellation festival. 

   The celebration will clearly out-glitz last <DATE>November</DATE>'s festivities for the 50th anniversary of the Bay Bridge, connecting <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION>. 
The Bay Bridge, always in the shadow of its sister span, celebrated with a string of lights, a 250-foot candle and a donated fireworks show, all costing about <MONEY>$225,000</MONEY>. 
"We wanted a low-cost, dignified celebration," a spokesman says. 
Bay Bridge officials had asked Golden Gate directors if they could celebrate together, the spokesman says, but the Golden Gaters replied, "We're professionals -- have your own party." 

   The Bay Bridge is overshadowed in other ways by the <LOCATION>Golden Gate</LOCATION>. 
A few years ago a study showed that distraught people drive across the Bay Bridge in order to jump off the Golden Gate, one of the world's leading suicide sites. 

   About 20 miles from <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, the people in <LOCATION>Crockett</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, population 3,000, will be throwing a shindig for the highly untouted <LOCATION>Carquinez</LOCATION> bridge, which turns 60 the week before the <ORGANIZATION>Golden Gate</ORGANIZATION>'s 50th. 

   The <PERSON>Crockett</PERSON> blowout will feature the release of a couple of thousand pigeons, and its own bridge lighting and rock concert. 
<PERSON>Gene Pedrotti</PERSON>, a local hardware-store owner, arranged for the donation of 500 flashlights and for residents to stand under their bridge and click them on at the same time. 
"We're not a controversial party," he allows.

THE BAY BRIDGE: THE BACKBONE OF S.F. IS BROKEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

More so than the celebrated Golden Gate, the Bay Bridge is the workaday 
backbone of the huge Bay-Area metropolis. Close to half a million people cross 
it every day, and more than a few probably think about earthquakes as they do 
it. 
</P>
<P>
For several hundred, the seldom-spoken fear struck close during <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> evening 
rush hour when a piece of the upper deck -- five lanes of roadway carrying 
commuters into <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> -- swayed and collapsed in front of motorists 
bound the other way on the lower deck. 
</P>
<P>
No cars pitched over into the dark waters of <LOCATION>San Francisco Bay</LOCATION>, but at least 
one motorist was killed in a car trapped by the falling debris. Fate seemed to 
spare many others, since the usual <TIME>5 p.m.</TIME> rush-hour traffic was remarkably thin 
for a <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME>. 
</P>
<P>
The <LOCATION>San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge</LOCATION> is the "other" bridge soaring out of <LOCATION>San 
Francisco</LOCATION>, but it is actually visible to more of the <LOCATION>Bay Area</LOCATION> than the <ORGANIZATION>Golden 
Gate</ORGANIZATION>. In recent years, the Bay Bridge spans have been brightly lit at night, 
although <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> the bridge was eerily dark except for the flashing orange 
lights of emergency trucks inching across the two decks. 
</P>
<P>
Motorists who were on the bridge when the quake hit reported confusion in the 
aftermath. Debbie and <PERSON>Thomas Kelly</PERSON> were on the upper deck, trying to return to 
<LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, when they shot videotape of a car falling through the crevice in 
the roadway. They said the car had been directed back toward safety, but had 
inadvertently turned the wrong way and pitched into the hole. The <PERSON>Kellys</PERSON> said 
as many as 100 cars had driven toward the collapsed section of the road rather 
than back to safety in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"It was sort of mass confusion," <PERSON>Thomas Kelly</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
There also were unconfirmed reports from witnesses on the bridge that some 
terrified motorists jumped into the water, but the <ORGANIZATION>Coast Guard</ORGANIZATION> could find no 
evidence. 
</P>
<P>
Other Bay Area bridges weathered the quake better. The Golden Gate remained 
open, and the <LOCATION>San Mateo Bridge</LOCATION> -- which was closed as a precaution -- is 
expected to reopen today. However, transportation officials advised residents 
to stay home if at all possible today to avoid gridlock on the roads. 
</P>
<P>
But it is the Bay Bridge that will signal the <LOCATION>Bay Area</LOCATION>'s return to normalcy. 
<ORGANIZATION>Caltrans</ORGANIZATION> announced late <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> that the Bay Bridge will be closed at 
least two days, maybe longer if inspectors find major structural problems. If 
no serious fissures are found, the lower deck of the bridge will be opened with 
three lanes going in either direction, allowing at least limited traffic to 
cross. 
</P>
<P>
However, the roadbed leading onto the bridge from the <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION> side was buckled 
and torn up, with parts of it under water, witnesses said <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>. One 
crack in the pavement near the <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION> toll booth was about 100 yards long and 
a foot wide. 
</P>
<P>
State emergency officials in <LOCATION>Sacramento</LOCATION> said they will install temporary <PERSON>Bailey</PERSON> 
bridges to span the collapsed section of the upper deck, and will try to 
operate ferries between the west and east sides of the bay. 
</P>
<P>
The gray Bay Bridge is squatter and less grand than the brightly painted Golden 
Gate. But the <ORGANIZATION>Bay Bridge</ORGANIZATION> is longer by at least double, and is a fitting symbol 
for the World Series between the <LOCATION>Bay Area</LOCATION>'s baseball teams. 
</P>
<P>
The Bay Bridge carries twice as much traffic as the <ORGANIZATION>Golden Gate</ORGANIZATION>, and its 
opening presaged tremendous growth in the <LOCATION>East Bay</LOCATION>. Oakland is the best-known 
community on the east side of the bay, but the bridge is the conduit that 
allows commuters to live in distant suburbs of <LOCATION>Contra Costa County</LOCATION> and drive to 
jobs in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Some engineers also believe that it is the more notable marvel. The <ORGANIZATION>American 
Society of Civil Engineers</ORGANIZATION> named it one of the nation's seven landmark 
structures, an honor never bestowed on the <LOCATION>Golden Gate</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The Bay Bridge and Golden Gate, longtime dreams of the <LOCATION>Bay Area</LOCATION>'s more 
grandiose thinkers, were both built during the Great Depression, beginning in 
<DATE>1933</DATE>. The Bay Bridge was finished first, opening in a grand celebration <DATE>Nov</DATE>. 
12, <DATE>1936</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
From <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION>, the bridge is cantilevered over the bay as far as <LOCATION>Yerba Buena 
Island</LOCATION>, where the world's largest bore tunnel was driven through hills. Then 
two suspension spans are attached to moorings in the <LOCATION>Embarcadero</LOCATION> area of 
downtown <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Rocks and dirt from the tunneling were dumped in the bay to create <LOCATION>Treasure 
Island</LOCATION>, site of a 1939-40 World's Fair and now a <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> base. 
</P>
<P>
A national survey in <DATE>1986</DATE>, when the Bay Bridge quietly celebrated its 50th 
anniversary, found that less than <PERCENT>1%</PERCENT> of people asked to name a <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> 
landmark listed the Bay Bridge, while nearly half mentioned the Golden Gate. 
</P>
<P>
The Bay Bridge's obscurity outside the <LOCATION>Bay Area</LOCATION> extends to suicide attempts as 
well. More than 800 people have died after jumping from the Golden Gate, 
slightly more than 100 from the Bay Bridge, though the roadways are both 250 
feet above the water. Some who jumped from the Bay Bridge even left notes 
indicating that they believed it was the Golden Gate.

The Golden Gate Bridge may soon undergo modern wind stress tests, partially to 
determine how the 52-year-old span would withstand blustery weather if a second 
deck is added for a rail transit system. A recommendation by chief bridge 
engineer <PERSON>Dan Mohn</PERSON> to study how much wind it would take to damage the suspension 
bridge, which in <DATE>1982</DATE> withstood 70-m.p.h. winds, was endorsed unanimously 
<DATE>Friday</DATE> by a committee of bridge directors. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, wind tests costing <MONEY>$39,863</MONEY> would be conducted in 
conjunction with a <MONEY>$423,640</MONEY> three-dimensional computer study of how a possible 
rail transit system on a lower deck would affect the bridge. The latter study 
is due to be released <DATE>March 25</DATE> by <ORGANIZATION>T.Y. Lin International of San Francisco</ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
   About 400,000 commuters trying to find their way through the Bay area's quake-torn transportation system wedged cheek-to-jowl into subways, sat in traffic jams on major freeways or waited forlornly for buses yesterday. 

   In other words, it was a better-than-average <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION> commute. 

   City officials feared widespread gridlock on the first day that normal business operations were resumed following <DATE>last Tuesday</DATE>'s earthquake. 
The massive temblor, which killed at least 61 people, severed the Bay Bridge, a major artery to the east, and closed most ramps leading to and from Highway 101, the biggest artery to the south. 
It will take several weeks to repair the bridge, and several months to repair some of the 101 connections. 

   But in spite of a wind-driven rainstorm, gridlock never materialized, mainly because the Bay Area Rapid Transit subway system carried <PERCENT>50%</PERCENT> more passengers than normal. 
For the first time in memory, it was standing-room only in BART's sleek, modern railcars. 

   Moreover, the two main bridges still connecting <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> with the <LOCATION>East Bay</LOCATION> didn't charge tolls, allowing traffic to zip through without stopping. 
Officials also suspect that traffic benefited from steps by major employers to get workers to come in at odd hours, or that many workers are still staying at home. 

   Many commuters who normally drove across the Bay Bridge, which is shut down for several weeks because of damage to one span, actually may have reached work a bit faster on BART yesterday, provided they could find a parking space at the system's jammed stations. 
In the best of times, the Bay Bridge is the worst commute in the region, often experiencing back-ups of 20 to 30 minutes or more. 

   Not that getting into town was easy. 
Storm flooding caused back-ups on the freeway, and many commuters had to find rides to BART's stations, because parking lots were full before dawn. 
Bus schedules were sometimes in disarray, stranding commuters such as <PERSON>Marilyn Sullivan</PERSON>. 
Her commute from <LOCATION>Petaluma</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, normally takes an hour and 15 minutes, via the Golden Gate Bridge, which connects <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> with the <LOCATION>North Bay</LOCATION> area. 
Yesterday, she was still waiting at a bus stop after three hours, trying to transfer to a bus going to the financial district. 

   "It's worse than I thought," she said. 
"I don't know where all the buses are." 

   But while traffic was heavy early in the commute over the <LOCATION>Golden Gate</LOCATION>, by <TIME>8 a.m.</TIME> it already had thinned out. 
"It's one of the smoothest commutes I've ever had," said <PERSON>Charles Catania</PERSON>, an insurance broker on the bus from <LOCATION>Mill Valley</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Marin County</LOCATION>. 
"It looks like a holiday. 
I think a lot of people got scared and stayed home." 
However, a spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION>BankAmerica Corp.</ORGANIZATION> said yesterday's absenteeism at the bank holding company was no greater than on an average day. 

   At the <LOCATION>San Mateo Bridge</LOCATION>, which connects the <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> peninsula with the <LOCATION>East Bay</LOCATION>, police were surprised at the speed with which traffic moved. 
"Everybody pretty much pitched in and cooperated," said <PERSON>Stan Perez</PERSON>, a sergeant with the <ORGANIZATION>California Highway Patrol</ORGANIZATION>. 

   There were many indications that the new work hours implemented by major corporations played a big role. 
The Golden Gate handled as many cars as normally yesterday, but over four hours rather than the usual two-hour crush. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Bechtel Group Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, the giant closely held engineering concern, says it has instituted a <TIME>6 a.m.</TIME> to <TIME>8 p.m.</TIME> flextime arrangement, whereby employees may select any eight-hour period during those hours to go to work. 
Of <ORGANIZATION>Bechtel</ORGANIZATION>'s 17,500 employees, about 4,000 work in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> -- one-third of them commuting from stricken <LOCATION>East Bay</LOCATION>. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co.</ORGANIZATION> is offering its 6,000 <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> employees a two-tier flextime schedule -- either <TIME>6 a.m.</TIME> to <TIME>2 p.m.</TIME> or <TIME>10 a.m.</TIME> to <TIME>6 p.m.</TIME> 
The flextime may cut by almost a third the number of <ORGANIZATION>PG&amp;E</ORGANIZATION> employees working conventional 9-5 hours, a spokesman says. 
Some of the utility's employees may opt for a four-day workweek, 10 hours a day, to cut the commute by <PERCENT>20%</PERCENT>. 

   At <ORGANIZATION>Pacific Telesis Group</ORGANIZATION>, flextime is left up to individual working groups, because some of the telephone company's employees must be on-site during normal business hours, a spokeswoman says. 

   Some individuals went to some lengths on their own to avoid the anticipated gridlock. 
One senior vice president at <ORGANIZATION>Bechtel</ORGANIZATION> said he got up at <TIME>3 a.m.</TIME> to drive into <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> from the <LOCATION>East Bay</LOCATION>. 

   But transportation officials worry that such extraordinary measures and cooperation may not last. 
Although one transportation official said drivers who didn't use car pools were committing "an anti-social act," about two-thirds of the motorists crossing the Golden Gate were alone, compared with the normal <PERCENT>70%</PERCENT> rate. 
And some commuters, relieved by the absence of gridlock, were planning to return to their old ways.

   This city is girding for gridlock today as hundreds of thousands of commuters avoid travel routes ravaged by last week's earthquake. 

   Estimates of damage in the six-county <LOCATION>San Francisco Bay</LOCATION> area neared <MONEY>$5 billion</MONEY>, excluding the cost of repairing the region's transportation system. 

   The Bay Bridge, the main artery into <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> from the east, will be closed for at least several weeks. 
Part of the bridge collapsed in the quake, which registered 6.9 on the Richter scale. 
The bridge normally carries 250,000 commuters a day. 
Also, most of the ramps connecting the city to its main link to the south, the 101 freeway, have been closed for repairs. 

   The Bay Area Rapid Transit system, which runs subway trains beneath the bay, is braced for a doubling of its daily regular ridership to 300,000. 
BART has increased service to 24 hours a day in preparation for the onslaught. 

   Most unusual will be water-borne commuters from the <LOCATION>East Bay</LOCATION> towns of <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Berkeley</LOCATION>. 
For the first time in 32 years, ferry service has been restored between the <LOCATION>East Bay</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>. 
The Red and <ORGANIZATION>White Fleet</ORGANIZATION>, which operates regular commuter ferry service to and from <LOCATION>Marin County</LOCATION>, and tourist tours of the bay, is offering <LOCATION>East Bay</LOCATION> commuters a chance to ride the waves for the price of <MONEY>$10</MONEY> round-trip. 

   That tariff is too stiff for some <ORGANIZATION>Financial District</ORGANIZATION> wage earners. 
"I'll stay with BART," said one secretary, swallowing her fears about using the transbay tube. 

   Officials expect the Golden Gate Bridge to be swamped with an extra load of commuters, including <LOCATION>East Bay</LOCATION> residents making a long detour. 
"We're anticipating quite a traffic crunch," said one official. 
About 23,000 people typically travel over the <LOCATION>Golden Gate Bridge</LOCATION> during commute hours. 
About 130,000 vehicles cross during a 24-hour period. 

   Meetings canceled by <ORGANIZATION>Apple Computer Inc.</ORGANIZATION>'s European sales force and by other groups raised the specter of empty hotel rooms and restaurants. 
It also raised hackles of the city's tourism boosters. 
"Other cities are calling {groups booked here for tours and conferences} and -- not to be crass -- stealing our booking list," said <PERSON>Scott Shafer</PERSON>, a spokesman for Mayor Art Agnos. 

   City officials stuck by their estimate of <MONEY>$2 billion</MONEY> in damage to the quake-shocked city. 
The other five <LOCATION>Bay</LOCATION> area counties have increased their total damage estimates to <MONEY>$2.8 billion</MONEY>. 
All estimates exclude highway repair, which could exceed <MONEY>$1 billion</MONEY>. 

   Among the expensive unknowns are stretches of elevated freeway in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> that were closed because of quake-inflicted damage. 

   The most worrisome stretch is 1.2 miles of waterfront highway known as the <ORGANIZATION>Embarcadero Freeway</ORGANIZATION>. 
Until it was closed <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, it had provided the quickest series of exits for commuters from the Bay Bridge heading into the <ORGANIZATION>Financial District</ORGANIZATION>. 
Engineers say it will take at least eight months to repair the Embarcadero structure. 

   As part of the quake recovery effort, the city <ORGANIZATION>Building Department</ORGANIZATION> has surveyed about 3,000 buildings, including all of the <ORGANIZATION>Financial District</ORGANIZATION>'s high-rises. 

   The preliminary conclusion from a survey of 200 downtown high-rises is that "we were incredibly lucky," said <PERSON>Lawrence Kornfield</PERSON>, <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>'s chief building inspector. 
While many of these buildings sustained heavy damage, little of that involved major structural damage. 
City building codes require construction that can resist temblors. 

   In <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Martin Leach</PERSON>, a spokesman for <PERSON>Lloyd</PERSON>'s of <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, said the insurance market hasn't yet been able to estimate the total potential claims from the disaster. 
"The extent of the claims won't be known for some time," <PERSON>Mr. Leach</PERSON> said. 

   On <DATE>Friday</DATE>, during a visit to <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> to survey quake damage, President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> promised to "meet the federal government's obligation" to assist relief efforts. 

   <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> officials plan to ask <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> for <MONEY>$3 billion</MONEY> or more of federal aid, in the form of grants and low-interest loans. 
The state has a <MONEY>$1 billion</MONEY> reserve, and is expected to add <MONEY>$1 billion</MONEY> to that fund in the next year. 
Some of that money will be available for highway repair and special emergency aid, but members of the legislature are also mulling over a temporary state gasoline tax to raise money for earthquake relief. 
However, state initiatives restrict the ability of the legislature to raise such taxes unless the voters approve in a statewide referendum.

   Like storm-tossed captains plotting a
course around rocks and shoals, a million <LOCATION>San Francisco Bay</LOCATION> area
workers _ their normal commute routes ruined by an earthquake _ are
devising new strategies for getting to and from work.
   ``I really don't see how there cannot be gridlock on <DATE>Monday</DATE>,''
said a harried <PERSON>Tom Silvey</PERSON>, a state <ORGANIZATION>Franchise Tax Board</ORGANIZATION> worker now
assigned to the <ORGANIZATION>state Office of Emergency Services</ORGANIZATION>.
   <DATE>Monday</DATE> is considered the region's transportation equivalent of
D-day along 70 miles from <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Santa Cruz</LOCATION>. It includes
a plan for using <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> landing craft to ferry commuters between
<LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, where four freeways and high-speed
connectors are closed.
   For much of the work force, commute times are expected to
stretch into an extra hour or more each way.
   The Bay Area Rapid Transit, the railroad that travels under <LOCATION>San
Francisco Bay</LOCATION> to connect the city with <LOCATION>East Bay</LOCATION> communities, is
running extra cars and expanding to 24-hour operation. Daily BART
business is expected to double to at least 300,000 person-trips.
   Morning comute tolls have been eliminated on all transbay
bridges except the Golden Gate, where commuters will be excused
from tolls on <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>mornings</TIME> only.
   By far the most serious disruption is to the traffic _ 243,000
vehicles each working day _ normally carried by the key
eight-mile-long <LOCATION>San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge</LOCATION>. It a major <LOCATION>San
Francisco</LOCATION> lifeline for food, industrial and other goods, vehicular
traffic from the east, and some half-million people a day.
   <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>'s quake dumped a 50-foot section of the bridge's top
deck onto the bottom deck of the 52-year-old span, and engineers
estimated repairs might take as long as two months.
   A driver who normally takes the Bay Bridge from <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> to
<LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION> must now either go 20 miles south and then cross the bay on
the <LOCATION>San Mateo Bridge</LOCATION>, or take the Golden Gate Bridge and drive 18
miles north in <LOCATION>Marin County</LOCATION> to cross the bay on the <ORGANIZATION>Richmond-San
Rafael Bridge</ORGANIZATION>. The southern route costs an extra 60 miles, the
northern detour an additional 40 miles.
   In <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION>, the upper deck of a 1\-mile portion of Interstate
880 collapsed onto the lower deck in a deadly vise of concrete and
steel. The roadway, a conduit to and from the <LOCATION>Bay Bridge</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>East
Oakland</LOCATION>, bay-side cities and points south, will be out of
commission for at least two years.
   In <LOCATION>Santa Cruz</LOCATION>, 70 miles south of <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, the 20,000
people who cross the <LOCATION>Santa Cruz Mountains</LOCATION> daily on State Highway 17
to work in <LOCATION>Silicon Valley</LOCATION> must seek alternate routes because
landslides have closed that route.
   The recommended alternates from <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Santa Cruz</LOCATION>: South on
101 to Highway 152 west, then north to Highway 1 _ 40 miles extra;
or, west from <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION> on Highway 9 _ 20 miles extra.
   <ORGANIZATION>Greyhound Lines Inc.</ORGANIZATION> announced <DATE>Friday</DATE> it had suspended bus
service to <LOCATION>Santa Cruz</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Watsonville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Los Gatos</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Cupertino</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Saratoga</LOCATION> because of the closure of Highway 17.
   In <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, central-city motorists used to zipping down
the hills to the <PERSON>Gough</PERSON> and Oak street connectors to Highway 101
found the on-ramps closed because of structural damage to roadway
underpinnings. They must now travel city streets for a mile or so
to find southbound on-ramps.
   In addition, the city's <ORGANIZATION>Embarcadero Freeway</ORGANIZATION>, which runs on the
edge of the bay, is closed because of structural failure. And the
I-280 extension from downtown <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> to 101 near <LOCATION>Candlestick
Park</LOCATION> sustained structural failure and will be closed for several
months.
   Those are the only two other double-deck freeways in <LOCATION>Northern
California</LOCATION> besides I-880.

   A mild earthquake early today shook a
wide area of <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, the sixth tremor in <LOCATION>Northern California</LOCATION>
within 24 hours, officials said.
   No damage or injuries were immediately reported from the quakes,
whose magnitudes ranged from 2.4 to 3.0 on the Richter scale.
   The sixth quake struck at <TIME>12:01 a.m.</TIME> and had a magnitude of 3.0
on the Richter scale, according to the <ORGANIZATION>United States Geological
Survey</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>National Earthquake Information Center</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Golden</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Colo</LOCATION>.
   It was centered west of the Golden Gate Bridge, the same area as
two earlier ones, said seisomologist <PERSON>Anthony Lomax</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>University
of California Seismology Station</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``We had several calls from all over the city but so far no
reports of damage,'' said a <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> police dispatcher who
declined to give his name.
   The first quake, which measured 2.7 on the Richter scale, struck
at <TIME>11:49 a.m.</TIME> <DATE>Sunday</DATE> and was centered about five miles west of the
bridge.
   Within two minutes, two more quakes, measuring 2.6 and 2.4 on the
Richter scale, were felt in southern <LOCATION>Marin County</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Lomax</PERSON> said.
   At <TIME>10 p.m.</TIME>, a magnitude 3.0 quake struck the same general area
off the Golden Gate as the first one, <PERSON>Lomax</PERSON> said.
   A quake that measured 2.9 was centered near <LOCATION>San Leandro</LOCATION>, about 10
miles south of <LOCATION>Berkeley</LOCATION>, at <TIME>10:41 p.m.</TIME>, he said.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude.
   A quake of magnitude 3.5 can cause slight damage.
   The <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> earthquake of <DATE>1906</DATE> measured an estimated 8.3 on
the Richter scale.

   In the midst of disaster, some companies
have stepped forward to offer free services to those in need, from
legal advice to fresh pasta.
   Lawyer <PERSON>Melvin Belli</PERSON> and his staff set up tables <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>
<TIME>afternoon</TIME> in front of his downtown offices, offering free legal
counsel to the public, said <PERSON>Marian Ashley</PERSON>, an employee at <ORGANIZATION>Belli</ORGANIZATION>'s
<LOCATION>Sacramento</LOCATION> office.
   <PERSON>Ashley</PERSON> said <PERSON>Belli</PERSON> and his attorneys were not working out of
their office because the building was apparently unsafe.
   <ORGANIZATION>Bechtel Group Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, one of the world's biggest engineering
companies, loaned the city of <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> the services of its
civil and structural engineers, said spokesman <PERSON>Larry Miller</PERSON>.
   ``This is our hometown and we'd like to help in whatever way we
can, and we thought this was the best way,'' said <PERSON>Miller</PERSON>. He said
similar assistance was also offered to <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION> and the state.
   <PERSON>Miller</PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION>Bechtel</ORGANIZATION> started trying to contact its estimated 200
engineers in the <LOCATION>Bay</LOCATION> area beginning <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>. As of <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>,
25 to 30 were helping the city inspect buildings.
   He said more engineers would be offered to the municipalities as
they report in to <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> headquarters. The <ORGANIZATION>Bechtel</ORGANIZATION> office
was otherwise closed <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
   ``We have got a total of 1,500 projects going on in the world
... so the expertise here is pretty deep,'' said <PERSON>Miller</PERSON>. ``It's a
valuable commodity to have, and we are just happy to loan it to the
city.''
   Cellular One of <LOCATION>Burlingame</LOCATION> offered to lend free cellular phones
to any emergency service agencies that need them, according to
spokeswoman <PERSON>Carolyn Casey</PERSON>.
   The company, which also has an office in <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION>, has asked
individual customers to refrain from using the network to give
better access to relief workers.
   She said the company has more than 400 channels, with a capacity
to handle about 200,000 cellular phones.
   ``We've had over 500 phones go out our door, to emergency
agencies all over the <LOCATION>Bay</LOCATION> area,'' said <PERSON>Casey</PERSON>. ``We're doing
everything we can. We have people manning our system 24 hours a
day.''
   The Golden Gate Bridge on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> did not charge a toll for
commuters from <TIME>6 a.m.</TIME> to noon, in an effort ``to help alleviate the
flow of traffic, the traffic crunch that never happened,'' said
<PERSON>Bruce Selby</PERSON>, spokesman for the Golden Gate Bridge and <ORGANIZATION>Highway
Transportation District</ORGANIZATION>.
   The district anticipates much more traffic today because of the
closed Bay Bridge.
   People left hungry got some help from the Aunti Pasta retail
store chain. Every person who entered one of the eight Aunti Pasta
stores in the <LOCATION>East Bay</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> was offered one-third
pound of fresh pasta.
   ``We really want to help people out,'' said <PERSON>Julie Kramer</PERSON>,
manager of one store where at least 30 people in two hours had come
in to get pasta.
   ``I think we all want to help out in whatever way we can,'' said
<PERSON>Kramer</PERSON>. ``It's our little effort.''

   Cable cars returned to the streets of <LOCATION>San
Francisco</LOCATION> on <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, after being stuck in their barn since an
earthquake knocked out electrical power two days earlier.
   By midday, enough traffic signals were working again so that
partial service on the popular tourist attraction could resume.
   Most of the city's landmarks, including the Golden Gate Bridge,
Coit Tower, Mission <PERSON>Dolores</PERSON> and the colorful Victorian-style homes,
were virtually unaffected by the powerful quake and remained
unruffled and picturesque as ever.
   Automobiles were snaking down the ``Crookedest Street in the
World'' of postcard fame, the block of Lombard on Russian Hill.
   ``The traffic hasn't stopped at all, except <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> when
they closed the street off because a cable car was stuck at the top
of the hill,'' said <PERSON>Jason Doty</PERSON>, who lives on the steep, winding
street. ``Our electricity is still out, but there are no other
problems here.''
   Not all the frequently photographed landmarks got through the
earthquake untouched, of course.
   The <LOCATION>San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge</LOCATION>, big sister of the more
colorful Golden Gate, was crippled. Some <MONEY>$4,000</MONEY> worth of glass was
broken at the <ORGANIZATION>Conservatory of Flowers</ORGANIZATION>, a huge greenhouse in <LOCATION>Golden
Gate Park</LOCATION>. At the bayside end of Market Street, the flag atop the
Ferry Building was tilted and the tower clock was still stuck on
<DATE>Tuesday</DATE>'s late-afternoon earthquake time, <TIME>5:04 p.m.</TIME>
   The Mansion Hotel, a Victorian building in the <LOCATION>Pacific Heights</LOCATION>
district, rode smoothly through its second major quake.
   ``It stood proud, and it's obviously a survivor. It looks
fragile but it isn't,'' owner <PERSON>Bob Pritikin</PERSON> said of the building
completed in <DATE>1887</DATE>. ``The only damage we found was a crack in a
bathroom ceiling.''
   Alcatraz, called ``The Rock'' by those who did chilly hard time
there when it was a federal prison, certainly lived up to its
nickname. Tourists _ though very few of them _ in the Fisherman's
Wharf area <DATE>Thursday</DATE> were pointing their cameras at the bleak island
in the bay.
   ``We like <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>,'' <PERSON>Alex Camenisch</PERSON> of Marthalen,
<LOCATION>Switzerland</LOCATION>, said as he and his family strolled through Fisherman's
<LOCATION>Wharf</LOCATION>, where there was no power and almost all businesses were
closed.
   They were not planning on staying overnight, however. ``We were
going to stay at a downtown hotel, but now we're going to stay
somewhere else,'' said <PERSON>Camenisch</PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON>Esther</PERSON>.
   On <LOCATION>Nob Hill</LOCATION>, about half the <ORGANIZATION>Fairmont Hotel</ORGANIZATION>'s 500 rooms were
empty as well as dark <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>. A national business group
that had reserved 450 rooms canceled a scheduled meeting.
   ``I was on the phone starting <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME> to groups with
reservations here the next 30 days. News reports have made things
sound pretty dismal, and I wanted to let them know the city was not
burning down,'' said <PERSON>Stan Boyd</PERSON>, director of sales for the Fairmont.
   At the <ORGANIZATION>Moscone Center</ORGANIZATION>, the city's largest convention center, one
event ended its run <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>. The next, a car dealers' gathering set
for <DATE>Oct. 26</DATE>, is still scheduled, as well as a convention of 5,000
plastic surgeons beginning <DATE>Oct. 27</DATE>.

   Humphrey the wayward whale swam under the
Golden Gate Bridge <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> and headed toward the open sea, ending
a four-day visit that saw one wrong turn after another.
   The 45-ton humpback whale passed under the span about <TIME>5 p.m.</TIME>,
escorted by a flotilla of small boats, <ORGANIZATION>Coast Guard</ORGANIZATION> vessels and
private cruisers.
   People on the bridge cheered as <PERSON>Humphrey</PERSON> swam by.
   He headed back to the ocean where he belongs a day after he was
freed from a stranding on mud flats along the shore of <LOCATION>San
Francisco Bay</LOCATION>.
   For a time, the mammoth mammal seemed to be re-enacting his <DATE>1985</DATE>
tour of <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> bay. Then, the wayward whale was tracked by
legions of well-wishers as he meandered, far from the open ocean
where he belongs, for 25 days.
   Anxious rescuers tracked the whale through the day as he seemed
to be headed anywhere but out to sea. First he was seen south of
the bridge, then away to the north.
   Rescuers mobilized to intercept the 45-ton whale and try to
induce him to head out to sea, she said. After the 40-foot <PERSON>Humphrey</PERSON>
was freed from the mud flat <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> evening he seemed to have
gotten his bearings, raising hopes he would join the rest of his
kind, which feed in the bay sometimes, but seldom stay for long.
   ``He was swimming well and going toward the Golden Gate,''
<PERSON>Denize Springer</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>California Marine Mammal Center</ORGANIZATION> said early
in the day. ``Well, he wasn't really going in just one direction.
Whales tend to meander.''
   Humphrey, for some reason attracted to <LOCATION>San Francisco Bay</LOCATION>, has a
history of meandering.
   In <DATE>1985</DATE>, when the news media gave him his name, he went through
the bay and up the <LOCATION>Sacramento River</LOCATION>, with much of the nation
tracking his wanderings.
   On <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, <PERSON>Humphrey</PERSON> veered off course again, turning left into
<LOCATION>San Francisco Bay</LOCATION> as his fellow migrating whales continued south
along the <LOCATION>West Coast</LOCATION>.
   He spnnt about 24 hours stuck on the mud flat before the <ORGANIZATION>Coast
Guard</ORGANIZATION>, the incoming tide and a crowd of cheering spectators helped
shake him loose <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME>.
   Experts could only speculate about why <PERSON>Humphrey</PERSON> went off course.
   ``Your guess is as good as mine. But my guess is something's
wrong with this guy,'' said <PERSON>Brian Gibeson</PERSON>, a marine biologist at
the <ORGANIZATION>California Academy of Sciences</ORGANIZATION>.
   It could be that a parasite has affected his brain or
rudimentary inner ear, <PERSON>Gibeson</PERSON> said, making <PERSON>Humphrey</PERSON> ``like a car
with his wheels out of alignment.''

UNIVERSAL SHUTS EARTHQUAKE ATTRACTION FOR TWO DAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK MATHEWS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Visitors to <ORGANIZATION>Universal Studios Tour</ORGANIZATION> arrived <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME> to find that the 
heavily promoted Earthquake attraction had been canceled because of the real 
quake that struck the <LOCATION>Bay Area</LOCATION> on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>. 
</P>
<P>
"We are closing the attraction for 48 hours out of respect and as a sympathetic 
gesture," said <PERSON>Joan Bullard</PERSON>, vice president of public relations for the tour. 
"We will continue to operate all other attractions as usual." 
</P>
<P>
The last customers on the tour <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> had already been through Earthquake when 
the 6.9 temblor struck at <TIME>5:04 p.m</TIME>. The two-minute ride simulates an 8.3 quake 
-- the size of the one that devastated <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> in <DATE>1906</DATE> -- and is 
designed, according to <PERSON>Bullard</PERSON>, as "a generic subway tunnel set in a bay area." 
</P>
<P>
She said that the attraction will resume its regular schedule on <DATE>Friday</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>Universal Studios Tour</ORGANIZATION> is on the lot of <ORGANIZATION>Universal Studios</ORGANIZATION>, and the 
Earthquake attraction is a spin-off of <ORGANIZATION>Universal</ORGANIZATION>'s <DATE>1974</DATE> movie "Earthquake." 
That film, which starred <PERSON>Charlton Heston</PERSON> and <PERSON>Ava Gardner</PERSON>, was set in <LOCATION>Los 
Angeles</LOCATION>, where a quake unleashes the waters of the <ORGANIZATION>Hollywood Reservoir</ORGANIZATION> onto a 
city already crumbled and ablaze. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Bullard</PERSON> said that the ride has been immensely popular since it was added to the 
tour on <DATE>March 18</DATE> and credits it with increasing attendance that may push the 
<DATE>1989</DATE> total to a record 5 million. She said that nothing has been done to cancel 
advertising for the attraction but that it is unlikely the TV promo will air 
during the two-day shutdown. 
</P>
<P>
Natural disasters have provided Hollywood with dramatic material from the 
earliest days, but the film community, perhaps because it was situated on the 
<LOCATION>San Andreas Fault</LOCATION> and didn't want to tempt fate, resisted using earthquakes as 
subject matter for decades. 
</P>
<P>
The first major film with an earthquake theme was the <DATE>1936</DATE> "<LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>," an 
extravagant production that used the real <DATE>1906</DATE> Bay Area temblor as the setting 
for a romantic drama starring <PERSON>Clark Gable</PERSON>, <PERSON>Jeanette MacDonald</PERSON> and <PERSON>Spencer 
Tracy</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
The earthquake scenes in the <DATE>1940</DATE> caveman soap opera "One Million B.C.," which 
starred <PERSON>Victor Mature</PERSON> and <PERSON>Carole Landis</PERSON>, were remarkable effects for the time 
and became stock footage for numerous later films. 
</P>
<P>
But it wasn't until special effects matured technologically in the '70s that 
Hollywood got serious about dramatically re-creating earthquakes, and there 
have been some eerie simulations since. Images of the collapsed span of the <LOCATION>San 
Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge</LOCATION> on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> looked like film clips from the 
<DATE>1978</DATE> feature "Superman." 
</P>
<P>
In that film, perennial Superman nemesis <PERSON>Lex Luthor</PERSON> (Gene Hackman) concocted a 
scheme to detonate the <LOCATION>San Andreas Fault</LOCATION> to trigger an earthquake that would 
split <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> down the middle and turn <PERSON>Luthor</PERSON>'s desert property into ocean 
frontage. Among the devastation that Superman eventually reversed was the 
collapsing of a section of the Golden Gate Bridge. <PERSON>Richard Donner</PERSON>, who directed 
"Superman," said that the images on his TV set <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> night looked like 
miniatures -- small-scale models used by film makers -- to him. 
</P>
<P>
"It was really chilling, that (news image) of the car going over the edge" on 
the Bay Bridge, said <PERSON>Donner</PERSON> in a telephone interview <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>. "I don't think 
I'll ever make a movie like that again." 
</P>
<P>
Donner, the director of the recent action hit "Lethal Weapon 2," said none of 
the earthquake scenes in "Superman" was based on actual scientific speculation. 
He said he might have chosen the Bay Bridge if that were the case; he used the 
Golden Gate Bridge simply because it was the better visual. 
</P>
<P>
Coincidentally, when the quake hit <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> <TIME>evening</TIME>, <PERSON>Donner</PERSON>'s sister was on a 
plane landing at <LOCATION>San Francisco International Airport</LOCATION>. Hers was the last plane 
allowed to land before the runways were closed. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Donner</PERSON> said he has become very earthquake conscious in recent years and has an 
"earthquake room" at his <ORGANIZATION>Hollywood Hills</ORGANIZATION> home where he keeps two months' worth 
of supplies for his family and their pets. 
</P>
<P>
"Last night, when I was out walking the dogs, I opened the room and checked it 
out," he said. "We tend to take it for granted (that we won't get hit that hard 
here)." 
</P>

<DESCRIPT>  AIDS; VICTIM; SUICIDE; SAN-FRANCISCO; BRIDGE  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  Two Sundays ago, at 11 o'clock in the morning, a man in blue jeans and a white
shirt leaped to his death from the Golden Gate Bridge, the 900th person to
commit suicide from the beautiful span that is San Francisco's signature.;   
Suicides off the soaring deck are ho-hum events here, dutifully recorded in
the local newspapers in a few unemotional paragraphs that as a rule do not
identify the people or explain their sorrows.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  AIDS VICTIM CAREFULLY PLANNED HIS SUICIDE  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     But this time, the dead man, <PERSON>Ron R. Berst</PERSON>, has been given voice by his
sister, who said she was compelled to tell the story of the 38-year-old
systems engineer who decided to end his life before AIDS stripped him of
control and dignity.;    "I couldn't let <PERSON>Ron</PERSON> go anonymously that way," said
<PERSON>Carla Berst</PERSON>, 36, who first described her brother's life and passing to <PERSON>Rob
Morse</PERSON>, who wrote a column about <PERSON>Berst</PERSON> in the <LOCATION>San Francisco Examiner</LOCATION>. "That he
was just a number and not a name is what drove me so crazy. Ron was <PERSON>Ron</PERSON>. There
was a lot behind the person.";    <PERSON>Ron Berst</PERSON>'s suicide was not a total shock to
his family, his sister said in an interview. He learned three years ago that
he had acquired immune deficiency syndrome, and he discussed with his parents
his plan to commit suicide "if he couldn't bear it anymore.";    But neither
his parents, who live in <LOCATION>Seattle</LOCATION>, nor his two sisters, who live in the <LOCATION>Bay
Area</LOCATION>, realized that <PERSON>Berst</PERSON> had come to that point, because he looked so well
and seemed so strong. Unknown to his family, he was suffering from a brain
infection that was beginning to cloud his mind.;    The <DATE>Friday</DATE> before his
death, <PERSON>Berst</PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> from his home in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, delighting
his sisters with an unannounced visit. They gathered for dinner, along with
some old friends from Seattle.;    The evening was alternately celebratory and
nostalgic, <PERSON>Carla Berst</PERSON> said, with much of the talk about childhood escapades.
Her brother sometimes seemed to "babble, jumping from one subject to the
next," but she wrote it off to excitement. At one point, she said, her brother
wept while talking about a friend who also had AIDS and was moving painfully
toward death.;    <PERSON>Berst</PERSON> and his sister had plans for <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>, which he
canceled, promising to call on <DATE>Sunday</DATE>. When he did not, <PERSON>Carla Berst</PERSON> telephoned
the motel where he was staying. Throughout the day and into the <TIME>night</TIME>, she
left messages, but her brother did not respond. By morning, she was
frightened. She asked the motel manager to enter the room and "look for
envelopes.";    He found several and summoned <PERSON>Carla Berst</PERSON>, who is a district
manager for a chain of coffee shops, to the motel. As she expected, there were
various letters inside. Some had been written in advance on <PERSON>Ron Berst</PERSON>'s home
computer, measured in tone. Others were overwrought, written on motel
stationery and signed "<PERSON>Ronnie</PERSON>," a name he had not used since childhood.;    In
the closet, <PERSON>Carla Berst</PERSON> found a jacket stained with the telltale orange paint
that must have come from the Golden Gate Bridge. She realized instantly what
that meant. Her brother had gone to the bridge earlier in the <DATE>weekend</DATE>, either
on a reconnaissance mission or an unsuccessful first effort to jump. By now,
she suspected, he was dead.;    She filed a missing-person report and went
home. There, a friend called to tell her of a brief story in that evening's
paper about the latest suicide from the bridge. Her suspicions were confirmed,
and later that evening she identified her brother's body at the coroner's
office.;    <PERSON>Ron Berst</PERSON> was a meticulous man, and he planned his death
carefully. One of his suicide notes, a two-page computer printout, includes a
description of his car and, handwritten in a blank space, where he parked it
at <LOCATION>Los Angeles International Airport</LOCATION>. The note also apologizes for locking the
keys in the glove compartment because he had only one set.;    Another note,
to his parents, has a computer headline at the top reading "File name: M &amp; D,"
for Mom and Dad. <PERSON>Carla Berst</PERSON> said there were drafts of suicide notes in <PERSON>Ron
Berst</PERSON>'s computer dating to <DATE>April</DATE>. Also in the motel room was a will, leaving
most of his possessions to his roommate and <MONEY>$10,000</MONEY> to AIDS organizations.;   
All the notes struck a similar theme.;    "I feel sick all (the) time; I have
no energy," <PERSON>Ron Berst</PERSON> wrote in one.;    "I very soon expect to become a burden
to my friends and family and I do not want to put any of them through such an
ordeal," he said in another.;    "Further, I want to be remembered as a fairly
active, vibrant, caring individual, not the bedridden, sickly, forgetful
person that I can see myself starting a path towards becoming.";    He
acknowledged that some people defined bravery as fighting to the bitter end.
"I did NOT 'give up,' " he wrote, using capital letters and quotation marks to
emphasize his point.;    "With AIDS, as you know, it is fairly downhill --
without much (any) hope for a reversal." The money spent on his extended
medical care, <PERSON>Berst</PERSON> added, could "be better spent finding a cure for this
disease.";    Since her brother's death, <PERSON>Carla Berst</PERSON> has pondered what
statement he was making when he chose the Golden Gate Bridge. He loved the
ocean, she said, and enjoyed skiing off the speedboat that he owned. He was a
weekend sky diver and "liked to free fall.";    "I think that bridge has some
kind of allure," she said. "It's like it calls people to it. I would have
thought he'd use pills. But this was certainly a stunning departure. It has
eloquence to it, and maybe that's what he wanted to say."  </TEXT>

   The yacht <DATE>Thursday</DATE>'s Child sailed
triumphantly under the Golden Gate Bridge on <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, breaking by
eight days the New York-to-San Francisco speed record set in <DATE>1854</DATE>.
   The 60-foot sloop crossed the finish line at <TIME>12:32 p.m.</TIME> and was
met by cheers and yells from hundreds of spectators. <DATE>Thursday</DATE>'s
Child set sail <DATE>Nov. 23</DATE> on a 14,500-mile voyage that took it around
treacherous <LOCATION>Cape Horn</LOCATION> on the tip of <LOCATION>South America</LOCATION>.
   ``I wouldn't do anything different, but I wouldn't do it again _
once is enough,'' said skipper-owner <PERSON>Warren Luhrs</PERSON> after he stepped
ashore.
   Luhrs and the other two crew members waved to the crowd after
bettering the 89-day, eight-hour trip by the 229-foot clipper ship
Flying Cloud during the Gold Rush.
   The crew docked the 10-ton vessel at <ORGANIZATION>Blossom Rock</ORGANIZATION>, about two
miles from the <LOCATION>Golden Gate</LOCATION>, because they said the submerged point is
where clipper ships used to drop anchor.
   About 80 ships were out on <LOCATION>San Francisco Bay</LOCATION> to greet the modern
racing sloop, while other spectators gathered on the roof of <LOCATION>Fort
Point</LOCATION> and at the south tower of the Golden Gate Bridge. A biplane
flew overhead trailing a sign that read: ``We love you TC.''
   <DATE>Thursday</DATE>'s Child's entrance into the bay was delayed for hours by
a four-knot outgoing tide and by a lack of wind.
   The crew tried everything, including putting out a large sail
called a spinnaker, but all its sails drooped. Finally, under a
bright, cloudless sky the yacht was able to sail under the Golden
Gate.
   Dozens of sailboats and powerboats had headed out the Golden Gate
for the occasion and the <ORGANIZATION>Coast Guard</ORGANIZATION> sent a 95-foot cutter and four
utility boats to escort the yacht into the bay and lessen the danger
of a spectator boat accidentally ramming <DATE>Thursday</DATE>'s Child.
   The yacht left from <LOCATION>Sandy Hook Bay</LOCATION>, 18 miles south of <LOCATION>New York
City</LOCATION>, and arrived in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> after 80 days and 20 hours, said
<PERSON>Thomas Conroy</PERSON>, race timekeeper at the <ORGANIZATION>St. Francis Yacht Club</ORGANIZATION>. He
said <DATE>Thursday</DATE>'s Child broke three other sailing records; <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> to
the equator, set in <DATE>1856</DATE>; <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Cape Horn</LOCATION>, <DATE>1857</DATE>; and <LOCATION>Cape Horn</LOCATION>
to <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, <DATE>1854</DATE>. The times and old records were not
immediately available.
   In a ship-to-shore interview earlier <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, crew member <PERSON>Courtney
Hazleton</PERSON> said he had ``that coming-home feeling.''
   ``It's kind of like a mixed bag of emotions right now,'' said
<PERSON>Hazleton</PERSON>. ``Both relief, letdown, that the whole thing's over, and
just a general feeling of accomplishment.''
   The crew _ <PERSON>Hazleton</PERSON>, 32, of <LOCATION>Palmetto</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla.</LOCATION>; <PERSON>Luhrs</PERSON>, 44, of
<LOCATION>Alachua</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla.</LOCATION>; and <PERSON>Lars Bergstrom</PERSON>, 54, of <LOCATION>Sarasota</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla</LOCATION>, who helped
design the vessel _ had spent <DATE>Saturday</DATE> zig-zagging north against a
stubborn headwind that delayed the ship's arrival by one day.
   Luhrs launched <DATE>Thursday</DATE>'s Child for the <DATE>1984</DATE> solo trans-Atlantic
race, in which she was the first American entry and the first
single-hulled boat to finish.
   The Flying Cloud was a merchantman that also ferried Gold Rush
adventurers around the dangerous <LOCATION>Cape Horn</LOCATION> at the tip of <LOCATION>South
America</LOCATION> and up to <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>. It could carry 35 sails on its tall
masts and was the fastest of thousands of clippers that raced each
other across the <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION>.
   The ship wrecked on rocks off <LOCATION>St. Johns</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Newfoundland</LOCATION>, in <DATE>1874</DATE>
and nothing is left of it.
   In the past seven years, five racing boats trying to beat Flying
Cloud's record sank in the howling gales and treacherous rocks of
<LOCATION>Cape Horn</LOCATION>.
   A second boat also attempting to break Flying Cloud's record was
damaged last week in a storm off <LOCATION>Cape Horn</LOCATION>. The Bark of the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION>, a
60-foot monohull, was in its 56th day of sailing.
   <DATE>Thursday</DATE>'s Child also had trouble during its run at the record;
it had to stop at the <LOCATION>Falkland Islands</LOCATION> for repairs after it struck
an unknown object.
   The modern vessel survived <LOCATION>Cape Horn</LOCATION>, but <LOCATION>Hazleton</LOCATION> expressed awe
and respect for the power of the sea when he recalled the passage
around the cape.
   `It got pretty bad ... very unpleasant,'' <PERSON>Hazelton</PERSON> said in an
interview by radio last week. He said they spent six days and nights
sailing into the teeth of wind gusting to 60 knots, through seas
that raged from all directions.

   San Francisco's Vast Tourist Industry
   Still Feels Aftershocks From Earthquake

   SAN FRANCISCO -- Six months after the earthquake, San
Francisco's $3.4 billion-a-year tourist trade, the city's
largest industry, is still feeling aftershocks.
   Merchants in Chinatown and Fisherman's Wharf report
business remains down since the Oct. 17 quake. They blame
lingering fears that have scared off leisure travelers, and
still-damaged freeways that are causing regional visitors to
go elsewhere for entertainment and shopping.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Spring, the season of the Chinese New Year, is typically
the busiest time of year in <LOCATION>Chinatown</LOCATION>. But businesses there
have seen sales drop <PERCENT>15%</PERCENT> to <PERCENT>40%</PERCENT>, says <PERSON>Rose Pak</PERSON>, consultant to
the city's <ORGANIZATION>Chinese Chamber of Commerce</ORGANIZATION>. Restaurants, gift
shops, and even small Chinese bakeries and produce markets
have been affected, she says.
   "Besides the overall decline in tourists, there's been a
decided drop in bedroom-community business," says <PERSON>Ms. Pak</PERSON>.
"It's too cumbersome now. We're worried the change in pattern
will become a habit, and they'll never come in anymore."
   "It's truly a mess to come into the city and drive
around," says <PERSON>Al Falchi</PERSON>, owner of the <ORGANIZATION>Waterfront restaurant</ORGANIZATION>,
which has seen business fall about <PERCENT>10%</PERCENT>. "There are so many
detours, you don't know where you're going."
   Businesses have been hurt by the closure since the quake
of the major freeway artery leading to <LOCATION>Chinatown</LOCATION>, Fisherman's
Wharf and <LOCATION>North Beach</LOCATION>, a popular neighborhood dominated by
Italian restaurants.
   To repair and strengthen the existing double-decker
freeway structure would cost about <MONEY>$32 million</MONEY> and take about
eight months. But <ORGANIZATION>Mayor Art Agnos</ORGANIZATION> has suggested a plan to
raze the structure and replace it with an underground
freeway, which would cost between <MONEY>$100 million</MONEY> and <MONEY>$120
million</MONEY>, and take about five years to complete.
   The current structure, built in the late <DATE>1950s</DATE>, "would be
considered a monstrosity on the Thames or the Seine," says
<PERSON>Art Silverman</PERSON>, the mayor's deputy press secretary. "The mayor
feels the earthquake has given us the opportunity to get rid
of an eyesore." Tearing it down would ease safety concerns,
he says, and the city believes federal funds would pay for
most of the proposed new project.
   <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>'s board of supervisors is scheduled to vote
on the mayor's proposal today. But <PERSON>Ms. Pak</PERSON> says at least 700
<LOCATION>Chinatown</LOCATION> merchants will be shutting down their businesses to
attend the meeting and oppose the proposal.
   Most city hotels suffered only minor earthquake damage,
and are in full operation, though occupancy rates are down.
(The Hyatt Regency at the <LOCATION>San Francisco Airport</LOCATION>, however, has
been closed since the quake for repairs and reinforcement. It
is scheduled to reopen <DATE>July 1</DATE>.)
   Occupancy fell sharply after the quake; Fisherman's Wharf
hotels, which before the quake boasted the city's highest
occupancy rates, were down <PERCENT>7%</PERCENT> for the year, says <PERSON>Jay Scott</PERSON>,
hotel analyst with <ORGANIZATION>Laventhol &amp; Horwath</ORGANIZATION>. Citywide, the
occupancy rate for <DATE>1989</DATE> was <PERCENT>70%</PERCENT>, compared with <PERCENT>72%</PERCENT> the year
before. For the <DATE>first quarter of this year</DATE>, the rate was <PERCENT>68%</PERCENT>.
   Convention and business travel has rebounded, although
fewer spouses are coming along for the trip. Independent
tourists, who account for about a third of hotel rooms, "have
been very reluctant to come back," <PERSON>Mr. Scott</PERSON> says. Besides
quake fears, he says overall belt-tightening in travel, and
higher airfares, may have contributed to the drop in leisure
travelers. The prime tourist season, now approaching, "will
tell how much the memory of the quake has faded and how good
a marketing job the city has done."
   Even though some merchants have tripled marketing budgets,
"there's no question some may close their doors," says
<PERSON>Alessandro Baccari</PERSON>, executive secretary of the <ORGANIZATION>Fisherman's
Wharf Association</ORGANIZATION>, which represents major retailers and 144
restaurants. Despite trying gimmicks ranging from a fish
festival to a live satellite telecast from the <LOCATION>Wharf</LOCATION> to
<LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>, merchants have seen business fall <PERCENT>25%</PERCENT> to <PERCENT>30%</PERCENT>.
   Even a half-year later, <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> still finds it tough
to counter the television images of the fire and devastated
homes in the <LOCATION>Marina</LOCATION> district, and of the Bay Bridge. "The
media showed the same pictures, over and over," <PERSON>Mr. Baccari</PERSON>
complains. "People say `My God, you've sunk into the bay, the
whole city's destroyed . . . We keep saying, `We're all
right. We want you. We need you.' "
   Mother Nature shouldn't take all the blame for tourism
woes, says <PERSON>Sharon Rooney</PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION>San Francisco
Convention and Visitors Bureau</ORGANIZATION>. "People are laying things at
foot of earthquake that don't belong there." Part of the
reason for lower occupany rates may be that about 2,000 new
hotel rooms have been added in the city in less than a year.
The <LOCATION>San Francisco Marriott</LOCATION>, the city's second-largest hotel
with 1,500 rooms, opened the day of the earthquake.
   Yet, she concedes misconceptions continue to hurt tourism.
She recently received a clip from a <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> newspaper reporting
that the Golden Gate bridge was back up. (The Bay Bridge,
which links <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION>, was damaged by the
quake. The Golden Gate bridge was intact.) "People see our
skyline and think, `Those buildings are going to fall on me.'
We know that the buildings swing. Other people have to be
educated."
   And despite the perception, based on erroneous early
reports, that hundreds died in the quake, she notes 62 people
were actually killed, 13 of them in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>. And she
adds, "not a single tourist was injured. We're trying to
stress that."

   About 80 demonstrators demanding more
commitment to stopping AIDS closed the Golden Gate Bridge during
<DATE>Tuesday</DATE>'s morning rush hour, stalling thousands of commuters in a
traffic jam.
   The fog-shrouded bridge was closed for 46 minutes while Highway
Patrol officers arrested 26 protesters affiliated with a group
called ``Stop AIDS Now Or Else.'' The demonstrators were cited on
charges of trespassing and creating a public nuisance and then
released, officials said.
   A spokeswoman for the group said they chose the bridge for the
protest because it would be ``the most disruptive to people.''
   ``AIDS is disrupting our lives and until people's lives are
disrupted, they don't pay attention,'' said <PERSON>Darla Rucker</PERSON>,
spokeswoman for the group of AIDS victims and friends of AIDS
patients.
   ``We don't have the time to wait. My friends are dying all around
me.''
   The demonstrators closed all the traffic lanes by spreading a
banner that read: ``AIDS = Genocide; Silence = Death; Fight Back,''
according to Highway Patrol officers, who called for police vans to
cart off those arrested.
   Some motorists stuck along <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> 101 north and south of the bridge
expressed anger at the demonstration and traffic tie-up.
   <PERSON>Ruth Wheeler</PERSON>, of <LOCATION>Larkspur</LOCATION>, said she veered off the highway in
<LOCATION>Marin County</LOCATION>, parked at a <ORGANIZATION>Safeway</ORGANIZATION> store and queued up with some 20
people to use five public telephones.
   ``People at <ORGANIZATION>Safeway</ORGANIZATION> were very upset. They said it was going to
defeat their (the protesters') cause,'' said <PERSON>Wheeler</PERSON>, who finally
arrived at her destination about <TIME>9:30 a.m.</TIME> ``The people said, `Hey,
if they think I'm going to be for them, doing something like this,
forget it.'''
   One motorist whose trip into <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> usually takes a
half-hour finally parked his car and took a ferry across the bay.
Although he beat most of the traffic, he said it took him two hours
to reach his office.
   Leaflets that the protesters distributed to motorists criticized
the government's handling of the AIDS crisis, quoted several AIDS
victims and urged motorists to ``Get out of your car and join us.''
   ``Are you sick and tired of being stuck on this bridge? So are
we!'' the leaflet said. ``Are you wondering how long it will be? So
are we! Are you wondering `Why me?' So are we!''
   A caller to <ORGANIZATION>The Associated Press</ORGANIZATION> bureau in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> said the
group was protesting ``the inactivity of the government the <DATE>last
eight years</DATE> and telling <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON> we're not going to remain
inactive.''
   ``We're going to continue to put pressure on <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> to do
more for people with AIDS,'' the caller said, refusing to identify
himself.

<LEADPARA>  Golden Gate Bridge officials, responding to anti-war protests that shut down
the span earlier in the week, today were considering fines of up to $10,000
for people arrested while blocking the bridge.;    To keep the city's main
bridges open, authorities closed the Golden Gate Bridge to pedestrians early
Thursday and massed along the on-ramps to the San Francisco-Oakland Bay
Bridge, which protesters closed for periods on Tuesday and Wednesday.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "We are trying to devise some penalty other than a slap on the wrist for
disruption," said <ORGANIZATION>Golden Gate Bridge District</ORGANIZATION> board member <PERSON>Gary Giacomini</PERSON>.
"The bridge is a vital artery for many people no matter how noble the cause of
the demonstration.";    The proposal is "just another in the tactics of
intimidation and harassment to make us fearful of our right to demonstrate,"
said <PERSON>Riva Enteen</PERSON>, demonstrations coordinator for the <LOCATION>Bay Area</LOCATION> chapter of the
<ORGANIZATION>National Lawyers Guild</ORGANIZATION> that is providing free legal services to the
demonstrators.;    "They can try to raise the fine if they want, but there's
going to be a lot of fighting in the courts over these cases," she said.;   
Currently, a maximum fine of <MONEY>$1,000</MONEY> can be imposed on bridge trespassers. The
state Legislature would have to authorize the increased fine. The bridge board
will see the proposed changes <DATE>Jan. 25.</DATE>;    At dusk <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, stunned by news
of the Iraqi attack on <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION>, somber and teary-eyed protesters gathered in
downtown <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> on the third straight day of anti-war demonstrations
that have filled this city with a deep sadness.;    Anger over <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
involvement in the <LOCATION>Persian Gulf</LOCATION> that had been expressed so stridently in
protests <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> and earlier <DATE>Thursday</DATE> appeared dampened by grief and fear.; 
  "I'm very upset about it," said a weeping <PERSON>Debra Davis</PERSON>, 24, who said she has
relatives serving in the gulf. "I think this means that eventually it will
turn into a world war.";    Others expressed disbelief and deep frustration.; 
  "I can't believe it's happening," said <PERSON>Stephan Morgan</PERSON>, 24, who, unlike many
in the group, was dressed in a sports jacket and tie. "I don't know what the
American people can do to stop this. I feel very confused.";    Protesters
wound slowly through the city's downtown and neighborhood streets, sometimes
roaring for peace, sometimes chanting softly for an end to the war. There were
no violent incidents and participants seemed determined to keep the march
peaceful.;    Earlier in the day, a somewhat larger crowd of about 3,000
disrupted the city's financial district. By <TIME>late afternoon</TIME>, at least 1,000 had
been arrested.;    An overtaxed police force jumped on municipal buses in
desperate efforts to chase the demonstrators, who switched targets from the
Federal Building to oil companies to the <ORGANIZATION>Pacific Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> and major
highways each time they were rousted from the pavement.;    Most of those
arrested <DATE>Thursday</DATE> were back on the streets within an hour, and at times
riot-clad police didn't move against groups blocking major intersections
because they had no place left in the city's <ORGANIZATION>Hall of Justice</ORGANIZATION> to process
demonstrators. So by afternoon, they began booking protesters at Pier 40.;   
All those arrested on misdemeanor charges were cited and released.;   
<DATE>Thursday</DATE>'s demonstrations, though loud and disruptive, nevertheless were
largely peaceful, unlike those <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>, when police cars were burned
and military recruiting offices looted.;    Officers were working 12- to
21-hour shifts to keep up with the three days of rolling protests.;    "We're
chasing them from one end of town to the other," said Lt. <PERSON>Daniel Hallisy</PERSON> as he
watched helplessly at a midday protest of about 2,000 demonstrators outside
the <ORGANIZATION>Pacific Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> on Pine Street. "We just don't know what they're
going to do.";    Hundreds of business people stood outside to watch. A plane
circled overhead, trailing a banner saying, "Go Desert Storm. Support our
troops.";    Although scuffles broke out between demonstrators and police, few
injuries were reported.;    As on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, the day of the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION>
deadline for <ORGANIZATION>Iraq</ORGANIZATION> to get out of <LOCATION>Kuwait</LOCATION>, protesters were out before dawn to
block all entrances to the city's Federal Building.;    Federal prosecutor
<PERSON>Mike Howard</PERSON> pleaded with demonstrators to let him get to his office. "I have a
major cocaine case I've got going," he said. "This dealer is killing our kids
on the street and I want to get in." Protesters standing six deep refused to
let him pass.;    In <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION>, about 200 people, including numerous high
school students, gathered at the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Building</ORGANIZATION> downtown in a peaceful
protest of the war, as groups have done there every day since <DATE>Monday</DATE>. On
<DATE>Thursday</DATE>, though, they had some competition: About 25 people in favor of the
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> military action staged a counterdemonstration across the street.  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Man Says Fall From Golden Gate Bridge `Lasted Forever'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MARTINEZ, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 29-year-old man who fell 220 feet from
the Golden Gate Bridge while trying to suspend himself in a trash
can is believed to be the first person to survive an accidental
fall from the span.
   ``It seemed like the fall lasted forever,'' <PERSON>Paul Alarab</PERSON> said
from a hospital bed in this town about 30 miles northeast of <LOCATION>San
Francisco</LOCATION>. ``I was praying for God to give me another chance.''
   There have been 851 known suicides from the 50-year-old bridge,
and only 19 people have survived suicide attempts. Alarab is
believed to be the first to survive an accidental fall.
   ``I have been counting my blessings ever since I fell <DATE>Sunday</DATE>
<TIME>night</TIME>,'' he said, despite his two broken ribs and collapsed lungs.
   The unemployed salesman said he planned to occupy a 33-gallon
barrel dangling from the bridge by a 60-foot rope to protest the
treatment of the elderly and handicapped. But he slipped while
lowering himself down the rope and hit the bottom girder of the
bridge.
   ``I tried to cling to the girder but I did a flip and continued
sliding down the rope. I hoped to land in the barrel but I missed
and fell head-over-heels, tumbling all the way to the water,'' he
said.
   ``I hit with my head and chest first. I remember hitting the
water, but it knocked me out immediately. I was about 20 feet
underwater when I regained consciousness and started to swim back
to the surface.''
   Alarab said he felt no pain or fear, theorizing, ``the
adrenaline and shock prevented the pain, and I just thought I
didn't want to die like this. I didn't want to hurt my family.''
   No one spotted his plunge, which he said happened about <TIME>10 p.m.
Sunday night</TIME>. Authorities found only the rope and barrel dangling
from the bridge and found a taxi driver who reported dropping a man
off on the bridge with the equipment.
   Alarab said it took two hours to swim to shore through the
strong current. Seven hours later, shivering from the 58-degree
water, he was spotted by a fishing boat and picked up by the <ORGANIZATION>Coast
Guard</ORGANIZATION>.
   Alarab said he plans to continue his activism for senior
citizens and handicapped, ``but I'll never put my life on the line
again because I feel so lucky to be alive today.''

<HEADLINE>  EMBARCADERO COMES TUMBLING DOWN
CHEERS GREET RAZING OF ROAD  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Mayor Art Agnos stepped into the cab of a red-and-white hydraulic ram and
took the first whack at the 60-foot-high double-decker freeway, closed since
the <DATE>1989</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>Loma Prieta earthquake.</ORGANIZATION>;    For a funeral, albeit for a freeway, the
mourners certainly were in jovial spirits.;    Singers belted out favorites
ranging from "Shake, Rattle and Roll" to "If I Had a Hammer." Fireworks
lighted the gray sky and a fireboat sprayed plumes of water in the bay. Five
hundred onlookers chanted "Bring it down!";    The 1.7-mile elevated roadway
will be demolished in 90 days and replaced with a combination ground-level and
underground expressway.;    Wearing a hard hat, Agnos jumped from the
demolition vehicle as soon as the drill chipped off a piece from the freeway.
Flashing a thumbs-up sign to the crowd, Agnos pounced on the concrete scrap
and smashed it to the ground.;    The symbolism of Agnos' act was not lost on
the crowd or a generation of <LOCATION>San Franciscans</LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION>Embarcadero Freeway</ORGANIZATION> had been
a thorny issue ever since it was erected in <DATE>1959.</DATE>;    Originally intended to
connect the Bay Bridge with the Golden Gate Bridge, the roadway was vehemently
opposed by environmentalists and neighborhood activists, who forced <ORGANIZATION>Caltrans</ORGANIZATION>
to stop construction before finishing the job.;    <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> became a city
with a permanently unfinished freeway that didn't go anywhere. Instead of
connecting to the Golden Gate Bridge, the freeway abruptly stopped near the
waterfront.;    Before construction crews were ordered to pack up, though, the
freeway went to <LOCATION>Chinatown</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>North Beach</LOCATION>, two popular tourist venues.;   
Merchants in those neighborhoods said the freeway, which carried 60,000
vehicles on an average weekday, was their lifeline. Throughout the <DATE>1970s</DATE> and
<DATE>'80s</DATE>, they effectively quashed any proposed legislation to tear down the
roadway, officially known as <LOCATION>Interstate 480.</LOCATION>;    Still, many politicians tried
to raze what everyone agreed was an eyesore. Former Mayor <PERSON>Dianne Feinstein</PERSON>
proposed demolishing it, but was unable to summon enough votes on the <ORGANIZATION>Board of
Supervisors</ORGANIZATION>. In <DATE>1986</DATE>, voters defeated a ballot measure to tear it down.;    In
<DATE>1987</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>American Institute of Architects</ORGANIZATION> held a competition to solicit ideas
on how to camouflage the clunky cul-de-sac. The winning design was a visionary
twin waterfall from the freeway's top and lower decks that would double as a
Yosemite-like nature shower and urban car wash.;    Since the <DATE>Oct. 17, 1989</DATE>
earthquake, the elevated freeway had been used as illegal site for roller
skaters, joggers, and late-night beer-drinking carousers who shared one of <LOCATION>San
Francisco</LOCATION> prettiest views.;    No one is saying that the demolition will be
painless. Tens of thousands of downtown-bound cars will have to be rerouted.
The freeway's concrete will be crushed on site, and its 60,000 cubic yards
will be enough to fill more than 5,000 dump trucks. More than 10,000 gallons
of reclaimed water will be sprayed at the site per day to control swirling
dust.;    Heavy rain dampened attendance <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, but not enthusiasm.;   
The city's famed Gay Men's Chorus sang "<LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>" a cappella. The <ORGANIZATION>Ethel
Merman Memorial Choir</ORGANIZATION>, a troupe of high-heeled and heavily rouged women and
men wearing hard hats, took center stage under the freeway. Lyrics included:; 
  "Shake, rattle and roll;    "Living on a fault line can sure takes its
toll.";    Uncharacteristic of most <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> events, there was no loyal
opposition present.;    "We come here not to praise the freeway, but to bury
it," said former <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> Supervisor <PERSON>Jack Morrison</PERSON> at the freeway
funeral.;    "It's not often in our civic life, we have an opportunity to
correct a 32-year-old mistake. In that way, the <LOCATION>Loma Prieta</LOCATION> earthquake was
kind to <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>," said Morrison.;    There were other options to tearing
down "the monster," as <PERSON>Allan Temko</PERSON>, the Pulitzer Prize-winning architecture
critic for the <LOCATION>San Francisco Chronicle</LOCATION>, has for years termed the freeway.;   
Repairing it would have been much less expensive, according to <ORGANIZATION>Caltrans</ORGANIZATION>.
Retrofitting the existing structure would have cost <MONEY>$69 million</MONEY>, as opposed to
tearing the Embarcadero down (<MONEY>$10 million</MONEY>) and building the new expressway
(<MONEY>$135 million</MONEY>).;    The federal government has allocated <MONEY>$59 million</MONEY>, with
state and other federal sources, along with sale of property along the
roadway, paying for the rest.  </TEXT>

cetacean. 
</P>
<P>
For the second time in five years, a flotilla of boats escorted the 40-foot 
marine mammal out of <LOCATION>San Francisco Bay</LOCATION> and into the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> as hundreds of 
people lined the shore to watch. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel wonderfully exhausted," said <PERSON>Patrick Brady</PERSON>, a rescue volunteer who, at 
one point, stayed up through the night to aid the trapped whale. "It was well 
worth it." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Humphrey</PERSON>, who had been towed from the muddy bay bottom <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> by a <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Coast 
Guard</ORGANIZATION> boat, was discovered <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME> still swimming in the bay south of 
the Bay Bridge. 
</P>
<P>
Volunteers from the <ORGANIZATION>California Marine Mammal Center</ORGANIZATION> and members of the <ORGANIZATION>Coast 
Guard</ORGANIZATION> resumed their rescue efforts, banging on metal pipes dangling in the 
water. The noisy action drove the whale out of the bay at precisely <TIME>5 p.m.</TIME> 
</P>
<P>
The three-day rescue was just a brief reminder of <PERSON>Humphrey</PERSON>'s 26-day sojourn 
into <LOCATION>San Francisco Bay</LOCATION> and up the <LOCATION>Sacramento River</LOCATION> <DATE>five years ago this month</DATE>. 
Frequently seen in the waters off <LOCATION>Northern California</LOCATION> since, he swam back into 
the bay on <DATE>Sunday</DATE>. Whale experts had no explanation for his unusual behavior, 
except to say that he is an unusual whale. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we'll ever figure out why he came back," said <PERSON>Marc Webber</PERSON>, a 
marine biologist with the <ORGANIZATION>Marine Mammal Center</ORGANIZATION> who helped coordinate the 
rescue. "Maybe he's got a screw -- or a flipper -- loose." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, <PERSON>Webber</PERSON> said <PERSON>Humphrey</PERSON> had tremendous value to his endangered 
species as an envoy who touched the hearts of humans. 
</P>
<P>
"What he's done in his life has really galvanized a lot of interest in whales 
and drawn people closer to whales," <PERSON>Webber</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
The rescue provided whale scientists with some of their closest contact ever 
with a live humpback -- including at one point standing on his flippers while 
he was beached near <LOCATION>Candlestick Park</LOCATION> for 24 hours <DATE>Monday</DATE> and <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
"He was very gentle with us," said <PERSON>Jan Roletto</PERSON>, curator of the <ORGANIZATION>Marine Mammal 
Center</ORGANIZATION>. "He could easily have crushed us." 
</P>
<P>
Although rescuers coaxed Humprhey to within several miles of the Golden Gate 
before dark <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, he swam back south of the <LOCATION>Bay Bridge</LOCATION> during the night and 
was discovered there <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME>. 
</P>
<P>
The 40-ton whale spent much of the day swimming back and forth in the channel 
between <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Yerba Buena Island</LOCATION> -- in sight of the city's 
financial district. 
</P>
<P>
For more than three hours, he resisted the efforts of rescuers to herd him 
under the bridge. The team members pounded on their metal pipes with hammers -- 
the same technique used by Japanese fishermen to catch dolphins and by rescuers 
five years ago to herd <PERSON>Humphrey</PERSON> out of the <LOCATION>Sacramento River</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
This time however, <PERSON>Humphrey</PERSON> repeatedly dived under water only to come up for 
air behind the line of boats. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, at about <TIME>3 p.m.</TIME>, he swam slowly under the Bay Bridge, meandered past 
<LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, spouted once under the Golden Gate Bridge and headed out to sea. 
Half-a-dozen <ORGANIZATION>Coast Guard</ORGANIZATION> and private vessels followed him more than a mile, 
just before sunset, to make sure he did not come back. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Humphrey</PERSON> has shown remarkable resilience. Whale experts said he appeared to be 
healthy, despite spending 24 hours stranded in mud. 
</P>
<P>
"He seems to be swimming and diving pretty well," <PERSON>Webber</PERSON> said. "That's a good 
sign. So far, he doesn't seem to be showing any sign of ill-effects." 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, the rescue of <PERSON>Humphrey</PERSON> has been a low-budget effort made up 
primarily of volunteers from the <ORGANIZATION>Marine Mammal Center</ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION>Coast Guard</ORGANIZATION> Lt. <PERSON>Jim Cash</PERSON> 
said the only additional cost for his operations was the fuel for the boats, 
which so far had amounted to <MONEY>$170</MONEY>. 
</P>
<P>
However, a <MONEY>$17,000</MONEY> underwater transmitter that was used in an attempt to lure 
<PERSON>Humphrey</PERSON> with whale sounds, was ruined after it was stuck in the mud <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.

"Not in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>" proclaimed the signs on 121 cardboard coffins that 
stretched a quarter of a mile across the Golden Gate Bridge during a mock 
funeral procession <DATE>Saturday</DATE> to protest the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
More than 300 people took part in the three-mile protest march from the <LOCATION>San 
Francisco</LOCATION> side of the bay to <ORGANIZATION>Vista Point</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Marin County</LOCATION>, just a few miles from 
the gas chamber at <LOCATION>San Quentin</LOCATION> prison. 
</P>
<P>
The march initially was scheduled as a protest of <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>'s planned execution 
of <PERSON>Robert Alton Harris</PERSON>, which on <DATE>Friday</DATE> was blocked indefinitely by a federal 
appeals court judge. March organizers said they were heartened by the stay, but 
decided to go ahead with their protest. They noted that the state wants the 
<ORGANIZATION>U.S. Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> to overturn the stay, perhaps in time to proceed with 
<DATE>Tuesday</DATE>'s execution. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a myth to think that killing anyone will make our nation any safer," 
declared activist entertainer <PERSON>Joan Baez</PERSON> in a brief speech before the protesters 
trekked across the bridge in single file. "I'm interested in creating a kinder, 
gentler nation." 
</P>
<P>
The 121 coffins, draped in black, symbolized the number of executions in the 
nation since a <DATE>1976</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> decision allowed states to reinstate 
capital punishment. Harris would have been the first executed in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> in 
23 years if the federal judge had not blocked <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>'s execution. 
</P>
<P>
The orderly march, sponsored by a coalition of religious and civil rights 
groups, caused traffic on the bridge to back up for two miles in each direction 
as curious motorists paused to watch. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the demonstrators wore black and carried red carnations. Several 
carried signs with such messages as "Execute justice, not people" and "Why do 
we kill people who kill people to show that killing people is wrong?" 
</P>
<P>
Some motorists shouted obscenities in angry disagreement with the marchers. 
Others honked approval and flashed "thumbs up" signs of encouragement. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not excited about carrying a coffin and wearing black," said marcher <PERSON>Signe 
Boyer</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Bay Area</LOCATION> music teacher. "But I feel strongly. If this is the way to 
take a stand against death, I'll do it." 
</P>
<P>
Mac Nishikida, trying out his new fishing pole at the bay' edge <DATE>Saturday</DATE> 
<TIME>morning</TIME>, was among a number of local residents who found themselves in the path 
of the protest. 
</P>
<P>
"The protesters are going against the people's choice of <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>," which 
favors the death penalty, he said, folding up his rod. "The vote is in. It's a 
problem of a minority trying to take over the overwhelming view of the 
majority."

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After tackling the 50th anniversary of the
<ORGANIZATION>Golden Gate Bridge</ORGANIZATION>, a public relations company has taken on the
enormous task of coordinating press coverage of Soviet President
<PERSON>Mikhail Gorbachev</PERSON>'s visit _ for free.
   Other local companies donated eight extra phone lines and four
extra facsimile machines to help the <ORGANIZATION>PBN Co.</ORGANIZATION>'s staff field requests
from more than 1,000 media organizations who want credentials for
more than 3,000 journalists.
   ``It's hopping,'' <ORGANIZATION>PBN</ORGANIZATION> founder <PERSON>Peter Necarsulmer</PERSON> said <DATE>Friday</DATE>.
   Unlike the <DATE>1987</DATE> Golden Gate Bridge celebration, which took more
than a year to plan and earned PBN <MONEY>$600,000</MONEY>, <PERSON>Necarsulmer</PERSON> said he
learned of the <PERSON>Gorbachev</PERSON> visit less than <DATE>two weeks ago</DATE>.
   He hopes the event will bring the company exposure and more than
compensate for the long, free hours. If PBN were paid for this job,
he said, the fee would run ``very, very well into the six figures.''
   The work was going ``far better than I think anyone could've
anticipated,'' he said, noting that the federal government, city
officials, the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION>, news media and security forces were
cooperating well.
   Veteran journalists said the real test of <ORGANIZATION>PBN</ORGANIZATION>'s 24-member staff
will be <DATE>Monday</DATE>, when <PERSON>Gorbachev</PERSON>'s schedule includes coffee with
former president <PERSON>Ronald Reagan</PERSON>, a quick trip to <ORGANIZATION>Stanford University</ORGANIZATION>,
a formal luncheon with business leaders in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, and a
possible meeting with <ORGANIZATION>South Korean President Roh Tae-woo</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``They seem to be doing okay,'' said <ORGANIZATION>San Francisco Examiner</ORGANIZATION>
Deputy Metro Editor <PERSON>Don Thornton</PERSON>. ``There seems to be so many
changes and fixes, it's been a nightmare for us.''
   ``They've got an impossible job,'' said <PERSON>Thornton</PERSON>. ``So far,
they're meeting the challenge ... We'll know <DATE>Monday</DATE>.''
   ``They've got a lot more to lose than gain.''
   About 20 people from rival public relations agencies volunteered
their time to help plan <PERSON>Gorbachev</PERSON>'s visit.
   ``It's amazing,'' said <ORGANIZATION>PBN</ORGANIZATION> account assistant <PERSON>Amy Pew</PERSON>. ``People
just really wanted to work on this.''
   Sleep has been hard to come by.
   ``I got some <TIME>last night</TIME>. I think I got two hours,'' said
<PERSON>Necarsulmer</PERSON>. ``But I'm feeling good. I have enough adrenaline to get
me through to <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME>. Which is why I, more than anyone
else, hope the Gorbachevs make their plane <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>.''
   Not everyone will get press credentials. Small pools of reporters
and photographers will be allowed to cover events, leaving others to
watch on closed-circuit television.
   ``You won't believe how many photographers will claim they work
for Life magazine,'' said <PERSON>Necarsulmer</PERSON>.

<DESCRIPT>  CALIFORNIA; GOVERNMENT; OFFICIAL; EARTHQUAKE; INSURANCE; PROGRAM  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  The state's new earthquake insurance program is under-funded and should be
delayed six months past its July 1 start-up date to prevent insolvency,
Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi said.;    Garamendi urged a legislative
committee Wednesday to put off the July 1 start-up date for the program while
officials consider issues including increased premiums, higher deductibles and
reduced coverage for California homeowners.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  California News  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  NEW QUAKE INSURANCE PROGRAM SHOULD BE DELAYED,
GARAMENDI SAYS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     "The state," <PERSON>Garamendi</PERSON> said, "should provide a bridge but perhaps not a
Golden Gate Bridge.";    The state-run pool was created last year to be
exactly that -- a bridge policy to cover damage that is not covered by
commercial earthquake insurance policies, which typically have deductibles of
<MONEY>$15,000</MONEY> or more.;    As it was designed, the state pool would cover damage up
to <MONEY>$15,000</MONEY> with a <MONEY>$1,000</MONEY> deductible and an average annual premium of <MONEY>$36</MONEY> to be
added on to existing homeowners insurance policies.;    That would have been
enough coverage for most of the homes damaged -- but not entirely destroyed --
by the <LOCATION>Whittier</LOCATION> earthquake in <DATE>1987</DATE> and the <LOCATION>Loma Prieta</LOCATION> earthquake in <DATE>1989</DATE>,
officials said.;    <PERSON>Garamendi</PERSON>, the state's first elected insurance
commissioner, said several serious problems with the state pool must still be
solved, especially a loophole that allows homeowners to withhold payments
without penalty.;    In addition, he said the preliminary studies show that
the premium level -- a sliding scale from <MONEY>$12</MONEY> to <MONEY>$60</MONEY> a year with an average
payment of <MONEY>$36</MONEY> -- would not raise enough money to pay all the claims from a
major quake.;    "In my judgment, the numbers don't work in the early years or
the later years," the Democratic insurance commissioner said after the
hearing.;    He said that it will take an average annual premium of <MONEY>$93</MONEY> to
provide <MONEY>$15,000</MONEY> in earthquake coverage for the state's approximately 6 million
homeowners.;    The average cost of homeowners insurance on a <MONEY>$250,000</MONEY> house
built in <DATE>1984</DATE> is currently <MONEY>$789</MONEY> a year, according to figures compiled by the
state <ORGANIZATION>Department of Insurance.</ORGANIZATION>;    <PERSON>Garamendi</PERSON> also said that the deductible
should be increased from <MONEY>$1,000</MONEY> to <PERCENT>5 percent</PERCENT> of a home's value. For a <MONEY>$250,000</MONEY>
home, for example, that would mean a deductible of <MONEY>$12,500</MONEY>. <PERSON>Garamendi</PERSON> also
called for limiting coverage to houses and excluding "cosmetics" such as
driveways, sidewalks and sheds.;    He asked that the start-up date for the
program be pushed back from <DATE>July 1</DATE> to <DATE>Jan. 1, 1992</DATE>, to allow further study on
how to scale back coverage and increase premiums to make the fund solvent.;   
Insurance industry officials testifying at the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> insurance subcommittee
hearing agreed that the program should be delayed six months.;    "The
handwriting is on the wall," said <PERSON>Tim Hart</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Association of California
Insurance Companies</ORGANIZATION>. "The program can't be done, can't be made to work by <DATE>July
1</DATE>."  </TEXT>

<TEXT>     The three men were retrieved from their perch by <ORGANIZATION>CHP</ORGANIZATION> officers and bridge
workers who ascended in elevators and then on ladders, their way lighted from
above by a hovering <ORGANIZATION>CHP</ORGANIZATION> helicopter, he said.;    "The banner said something
like 'Stop the war' or 'No war for oil,' or something like that," <PERSON>Kritzer</PERSON>
said.;    The aerial show didn't affect bridge traffic, said Sgt. <PERSON>Daniel Brown</PERSON>
of the bridge security force.;    But, he said, "it was a pretty silly thing
to do. It was foggy so the cables to the 742-foot high tower were wet and
slippery.";    The three men were booked into <LOCATION>Marin County Jail</LOCATION> on suspicion
of misdemeanor counts of trespassing and creating a public nuisance, <PERSON>Kritzer</PERSON>
said.;    A woman who dropped off the three young men with backpacks on the
bridge at about midspan for their climb was booked on similar charges, he
said.;    Their identities were not immediately available.;    The bridge
incident followed <DATE>Sunday</DATE>'s demonstration in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> where about 2,500
protesters marched up Market Street to denounce the allied ground offensive in
the <LOCATION>Persian Gulf.</LOCATION>;    The spirited demonstration was substantially smaller
than several short-notice protests held here since the beginning of allied
bombing attacks last month, a fact some protesters attributed to a seemingly
unstoppable <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> war machine. A police spokesman reported six arrests.;   
"People are really depressed," said marcher <PERSON>Nancy Morris</PERSON>, a professor at
<LOCATION>Berkeley</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Graduate Theological Union</ORGANIZATION>. "People don't feel any hope about
changing people's minds. We're doing this more for ourselves.";    The
three-hour march was orderly until it reached the Federal Building near the
Civic Center. "They burned some flags, set a dumpster on fire and broke some
windows," Police Capt. <PERSON>Michael Yalon</PERSON> reported.;    In <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION>'s downtown
Plaza Park, about two dozen demonstrators waved placards and flashed peace
signs at passing motorists.;    "People have been calling all day with a sense
of despair and outrage," said <PERSON>Susan Fogel</PERSON>, a spokeswoman for Women Against the
War.;    In <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, as the demonstrators marched up Market Street, they
passed a T-shirt shop that six weeks ago displayed a variety of styles with
the slogan "No blood for oil." Now most T-shirts hanging in the front of the
shop feature large <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> flags and the words "Proud to be an American."  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Tap Dancers Shuffle Across Golden Gate During National Tap Day</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY McGRATH</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   A chorus line of shuffle-stepping tap
dancers hoofed it across the Golden Gate Bridge on <DATE>Thursday</DATE>,
celebrating <ORGANIZATION>National Tap Dance</ORGANIZATION> Day on the birthday of legendary
tapper Bill ``Bojangles'' <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON>.
   The wind and salty air threatened to blow off their hats as
about 30 dancers shim-sham-shimmied across the span dodging
befuddled joggers and bicyclists.
   ``I don't care if I'm overweight and pushing 40. I feel like a
star,'' said tap dancer <PERSON>Debby Keleher</PERSON>, thrusting her arms out like
<PERSON>Ethel Merman</PERSON>.
   The BART escalator mechanic, who practices on broken subway
escalators in her cowgirl costume, passed a gold-sequined ``torch
of tap'' during the single-file relay watched by wide-eyed drivers.
   Against a backdrop of <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> skyscrapers and a vast
expanse of water below, the tappers made their way from <LOCATION>Marin</LOCATION> to
the <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> side where they received a <ORGANIZATION>City Hall</ORGANIZATION> proclamation.
   In <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, Rep. <PERSON>John Conyers</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-Mich.</LOCATION>, got a resolution
approved by the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> declaring <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>National Tap Dance Day</ORGANIZATION>.
Conyers, who admitted being a frustrated tap dancer soon to begin
lessons, was playing host to celebrations in the nation's capital
by the <ORGANIZATION>Tap America Project</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``Tap dancing is widely recognized as <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s only original
form of dance, yet for years it has been in danger of becoming a
lost art,'' <PERSON>Conyers</PERSON>, said in a telephone interview.
   He said <PERSON>Bojangles</PERSON>' former dance partner, 65-year-old <PERSON>Lloyd
Story</PERSON>, tried to tap on the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> floor but was barred by the
parliamentarian, who said it violated rules against demonstrations.
   On the bridge, English tourist <PERSON>Joan Burke</PERSON> let out a whoop when
the dancers assembled.
   ``Oh great. We saw `42nd Street,' the musical in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>. Yes,
it's super. This is a bonus,'' <PERSON>Burke</PERSON> said as her husband, <PERSON>Paul</PERSON>,
snapped pictures of dancers from the group <PERSON>Rosie Radiator</PERSON> and the
<LOCATION>San Francisco Supertappers</LOCATION>.
   The troupe, led by <PERSON>Rosie</PERSON> in her red flared skirt, white tuxedo
vest, and sailor hat, is listed in the Guinness Book of World
Records for longest tap dance for its 7.3-mile performance in <DATE>1987</DATE>.
   Seven tap dancers with sandwich boards were barred from crossing
the span by officials who feared written words would distract
commuters on the six-lane bridge.
   But everything was copacetic, as Bojangles used to say, for an
``aerobitapper,'' with metal taps on her running shoes, and a
tapping clown, who stomped their way across.
   Tap, a rhythmic art that blends African dance with the Irish jig
and lively English clog, originated among black dancers performing
on street corners and in saloons.
   Unlike ballet dancers, tap dancers hold their body limp like a
rag doll and use the natural movements to belt out rhythms with
their feet.
   Tap greats such as Bill ``Bojangles'' <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON>, who died in
<DATE>1949</DATE>, and <PERSON>Howard</PERSON> ``Sandman'' <PERSON>Sims</PERSON> popularized the dance in musical
extravaganzas of the <DATE>1930s</DATE> and 40s.
   ``There is a happiness there when I tap dance,'' said hoofer
<PERSON>Marilyn Winston</PERSON>. ``There are very few ways that comes out of my
body. It's a natural happiness that comes out of me. I have to tap
to live.''

<HEAD>Humphrey the Wrong-Way Whale Makes it Out Golden Gate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES O. CLIFFORD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   <PERSON>Humphrey</PERSON>, the humpback whale with either
wanderlust or an out-of-whack compass, swam under the Golden Gate
Bridge and out to sea after his latest visit to the City by the
<LOCATION>Bay</LOCATION>.
   Accompanied by a flotilla of boats, the 40-foot, 45-ton whale
cruised into the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> <DATE>late Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME>, bringing cheers
from his human escorts.
   ``He looks happy, like this is where he belongs,'' said <ORGANIZATION>Coast
Guard Seaman Walter McCrea</ORGANIZATION>.
   Humphrey, drawn for some unknown reason to <LOCATION>San Francisco Bay</LOCATION>,
tends to overdo his meanderings. In <DATE>1985</DATE>, when the media named him
<PERSON>Humphrey</PERSON>, he took a 25-day tour of the area's inland waters. He has
come back every year since.
   On <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, <PERSON>Humphrey</PERSON> returned to the bay and took several more
wrong turns before he wandered into shallow water and spent a day
stuck on a mud flat. After being freed <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, <PERSON>Humphrey</PERSON> swam
toward the ocean.
   Whale scientists have no idea why he goes off course.
   ``My guess is something's wrong with this guy,'' said <PERSON>Brian
Gibeson</PERSON>, a marine biologist at the <ORGANIZATION>California Academy of Sciences</ORGANIZATION>.
It could be that a parasite has affected his brain or inner ear,
making <PERSON>Humphrey</PERSON> ``like a car with his wheels out of alignment.''
   Most whales stay about 20 miles outside the Golden Gate, but
some like to feed in shallower waters, said <PERSON>Denize Springer</PERSON> of the
<ORGANIZATION>Marine Mammal Center</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Marin County</LOCATION>. ``It's not unusual for whales
to come into the bay. But they usually just take a bite and
leave.''
   Marine biologists feared <PERSON>Humphrey</PERSON> might die while stuck in the
shallows near <LOCATION>Candlestick Park</LOCATION>.
   A <ORGANIZATION>Coast Guard</ORGANIZATION> boat tugged <PERSON>Humphrey</PERSON> with a line as wading people
pushed and nudged him until the whale was able to get loose at high
tide. A crowd on shore cheered.

<HEAD>Officials Prepare for Big Traffic Crunch on Monday</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A ferry boat armada is being prepared as
transit officials brace for a monumental traffic jam on <LOCATION>San
Francisco Bay</LOCATION> area freeways <DATE>Monday</DATE> when most workers return to
their jobs in the quake-ravaged region.
   Some roads already have been gripped by gridlock despite fewer
commuters in the aftermath of <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>'s quake, which shut down the
vital bridge linking <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION> and the rest of the
<LOCATION>East Bay</LOCATION>.
   Ferry boats may relieve some of the pressure on the highways.
   ``We've got three days to get ready for <DATE>Monday</DATE> with as much of
an armada as possible,'' state <PERSON>Sen. Quentin Kopp</PERSON> said at an
emergency meeting of the <ORGANIZATION>Metropolitan Transportation Commission</ORGANIZATION> on
<DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   ``I don't see much alternative to water over the next couple of
weeks,'' while the <LOCATION>San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge</LOCATION> is repaired,
<PERSON>Kopp</PERSON> said. A 50-foot section of the bridge collapsed during the
quake and could take up to two months to repair.
   Kopp said some 45 vessels, ranging from elegant dining cruise
boats to <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> landing craft, could be pressed into service to carry
up to 60,000 commuters across the waters. <PERSON>Kopp</PERSON> said 20 <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> boats
were made available by the <ORGANIZATION>12th Naval District</ORGANIZATION>.
   But that still leaves at least 50,000 additional commuters who
normally take the bridge.
   ``It'll get bad <DATE>Monday</DATE>,'' said <PERSON>George Gray</PERSON>, deputy district
director for public transportation at the <ORGANIZATION>California Department of
Transportation</ORGANIZATION>.
   He encouraged people to stay home and work through personal
computers or to adopt flexible work hours.
   On <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, about <PERCENT>60 percent</PERCENT> of the usual number of commuters
struggled to reach work by train, boat or car. Many found
themselves in traffic jams. Some arrived at buildings still in the
dark or with only partial power. Others turned back after facing up
to four-hour delays on the overburdened highways.
   ``People are just trying to get back to reality, to make life
like it was before,'' said <PERSON>Steve Tomberlin</PERSON> of Traffic Central, a
private traffic information service.
   Some commuters from the <LOCATION>East Bay</LOCATION> took a circuitous route south
to the <LOCATION>San Francisco Peninsula</LOCATION> and then north to <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> that
added hours to the average hour-long drive they would have taken
across the Bay Bridge.
   Those who took the northern route, across the San
Rafael-Richmond Bridge to <LOCATION>Marin County</LOCATION> and then across the Golden
Gate Bridge, faced delays of up to 90 minutes.
   Bay <ORGANIZATION>Area Rapid Transit</ORGANIZATION> has restored full operations for the
morning commute, but it appeared that few car-lovers were switching
to the subterranean train line.
   System analyst <PERSON>Joan Nomara</PERSON> said the passenger load _ typically
about 50,000 people each way on weekdays _ was around <PERCENT>70 percent</PERCENT> on
<DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   BART also announced round-the-clock service would begin <DATE>Monday</DATE>.
The system is usually shut between <TIME>midnight</TIME> and <TIME>6 a.m.</TIME>
