TELEVISION / LARRY STEWART: BOWL GAME LINEUP: TOO MUCH OF A GOOD THING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Yes, there is such a thing as too much football. 
</P>
<P>
Seven bowl games on New Year's Day is about four too many. 
</P>
<P>
While the <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> presents a nice, neat postseason tournament, what the colleges 
present is a mess. 
</P>
<P>
Try watching seven games within an 11-hour span. It's enough to make your head 
spin worse than any New Year's Day hangover. 
</P>
<P>
The first game <DATE>Monday</DATE> was the <PERSON>Hall</PERSON> of Fame Bowl game. <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION> had to cut away from 
its coverage of the Rose Parade, but at least it didn't run into the 
overlapping problems that <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION> did. 
</P>
<P>
The <PERSON>Hall</PERSON> of Fame Bowl game ended, <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION> wasted little time switching to the 
Fiesta Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
It was nice and clean, far better than <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION>'s switch from the <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> Citrus 
Bowl game to the Rose Bowl game. 
</P>
<P>
ABC took its time making the switch. ABC started off by showing a promotional 
spot for the upcoming Rose Bowl game. Thanks, but we knew it was coming. 
</P>
<P>
Then came a promo for <ORGANIZATION>ABC Sports</ORGANIZATION>, then a 'thank-you" promo to an airline that 
provides it with free travel. Then there were two promos for <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION> shows, 
followed by a news brief. 
</P>
<P>
What next? Three consecutive commercials. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, an introduction for the Rose Bowl game, followed by a taped interview 
with <PERSON>Bo Schembechler</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
Then came more <ORGANIZATION>ABC Sports</ORGANIZATION> graphics and two more commercials. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, by the way, the Cotton Bowl on <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION> was still going on. Arkansas scored on a 
long pass play and after a failed two-point conversion attempt, the Razorbacks 
trailed <LOCATION>Tennessee</LOCATION>, 31-27, with 1:29 left. 
</P>
<P>
OK, we were finally going to see the Rose Bowl game kickoff, right? Nah. 
</P>
<P>
First there was a Big Ten promo, more <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION> graphics and then finally a glimpse 
of the Rose Bowl, where the crowd was finishing singing the <ORGANIZATION>National Anthem</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Then came an introduction from announcer <PERSON>Keith Jackson</PERSON>, and another taped piece 
on <PERSON>Schembechler</PERSON>, this one showing a <DATE>1971</DATE> pep talk. 
</P>
<P>
Next was another commercial, then a Pacific 10 promo followed by one more 
commercial. 
</P>
<P>
The teams finally took the field, and <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON> and commentator <PERSON>Bob Griese</PERSON> then 
offered a little pregame analysis, as if there already hadn't been enough. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in the <LOCATION>Fiesta Bowl</LOCATION> game, <ORGANIZATION>Florida State</ORGANIZATION> missed a field-goal attempt 
and trailed <LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION>, 7-0. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the Rose Bowl game kickoff came, 18 minutes after the end of the 
Citrus Bowl game. 
</P>
<P>
One play after the kickoff at the Rose Bowl game, <ORGANIZATION>Florida State</ORGANIZATION> recovered a 
fumble to set up its first touchdown to tie the score on the way to a rout of 
the <ORGANIZATION>Cornhuskers</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
At least we were down to only two games, the Cotton Bowl game having ended. 
</P>
<P>
It was quite a task trying to watch the <PERSON>Hall</PERSON> of Fame, the Citrus and the Cotton 
Bowl games all at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
The Cotton Bowl game was the last of the three early games to start. 
</P>
<P>
The Citrus Bowl game began shortly after ABC went from <LOCATION>Pasadena</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Orlando</LOCATION>, 
<LOCATION>Fla.</LOCATION>But it didn't take long to realize there was going to be a time squeeze 
later in the day. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly Citrus Bowl game announcer <PERSON>Gary Bender</PERSON> sensed it. As officials 
discussed a <DATE>first-quarter</DATE> penalty, <PERSON>Bender</PERSON> said: "Come on, fellas, we've got a 
lot of football to play today." 
</P>
<P>
If you happened to be watching the <PERSON>Hall</PERSON> of Fame Bowl game you saw <ORGANIZATION>Ohio State</ORGANIZATION>'s 
<PERSON>Zack Dumas</PERSON> level <ORGANIZATION>Auburn</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Stacy Danley</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
Announcer <PERSON>Don Criqui</PERSON> first said: "That's got to be the hardest hit of the 
'89-90 bowl season." 
</P>
<P>
Then, after viewing a replay, <PERSON>Criqui</PERSON> said: "It's the hardest hit I've seen in 
football in years." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed it was. 
</P>
<P>
A little later in the game, <PERSON>Criqui</PERSON>, talking about <ORGANIZATION>Auburn</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Shayne Wasden</PERSON>'s punt 
returns of 30 and 34 yards, said they broke the Orange Bowl game record. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe you can't blame <PERSON>Criqui</PERSON> for being confused. He worked the last eight 
Orange Bowl games. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of flubs, <PERSON>O.J. Simpson</PERSON>, during halftime of the <PERSON>Hall</PERSON> of Fame Bowl game, 
referred to <LOCATION>Notre Dame</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>George Gipp</PERSON> as <PERSON>George Kemp</PERSON>, or something like that. 
However, <PERSON>Simpson</PERSON> did catch the mistake and corrected himself. 
</P>
<P>
In referring to <PERSON>Gipp</PERSON>'s death, comparing it to the death of <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION> quarterback 
<PERSON>Sal Aunese</PERSON>, <PERSON>Simpson</PERSON> said it occurred a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION> colleague <PERSON>Bob Costas</PERSON>, fearing <PERSON>Simpson</PERSON>'s attempt at sarcasm was probably 
lost on most viewers, added: "It was more than a few years ago. It was so long 
ago that a young <PERSON>Ronald Reagan</PERSON> could play <PERSON>Gipp</PERSON> (in the <DATE>1940</DATE> movie, 'The <ORGANIZATION>Knute 
Rockne All-American</ORGANIZATION>')." 
</P>
<P>
During halftime of the <PERSON>Hall</PERSON> of Fame Bowl game, <PERSON>Gayle Gardner</PERSON> -- yes, she still 
works for <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION> -- did a nice taped interview with <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> Coach <PERSON>Dennis Erickson</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
And <PERSON>Gardner</PERSON>, during halftime of the Fiesta Bowl game, offered an excellent 
feature on the once-troubled <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION> football program and the death of <PERSON>Aunese</PERSON> 
this past <DATE>September</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
CBS, meanwhile, deserves kudos for a halftime segment it showed during the 
Cotton Bowl. It chronicled the highlights of college football during the <DATE>1980s</DATE>, 
including <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>'s <DATE>1982</DATE> kickoff return against <ORGANIZATION>Stanford</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION> broke a story that <ORGANIZATION>Notre Dame</ORGANIZATION> defensive coordinator <PERSON>Barry Alvarez</PERSON> would 
become coach at <LOCATION>Wisconsin</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The network had <PERSON>Ralph Wiley</PERSON> interview <PERSON>Alvarez</PERSON> later in the day, but because of 
technical problems, had to cut away from it earlier than planned. 
</P>
<P>
On <TIME>this long day and night</TIME> of football, the overall coverage and the announcing 
was fine. 
</P>
<P>
But something needs to be done about the logjam. The way things are now, it's 
impossible to see everything. 
</P>
<P>
Just trying is a real job -- and no fun.

MELVIN DURSLAG: A CRAZY EIGHT IS TOO MUCH FOR ONE TV SCREEN; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE FOOTBALL: THE OVERABUNDANCE OF BOWL GAMES ON NEW YEAR'S DAY MAKES IT 
IMPOSSIBLE TO WATCH THEM ALL. WHO CAME UP WITH THIS SYSTEM? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MELVIN DURSLAG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Inspecting the bowl football program on New Year's Day, you have a vision of 
herring in a net, flopping over one another. 
</P>
<P>
The current lineup embraces eight games, running from 8:30 in the <TIME>morning</TIME> (PST) 
until roughly <TIME>8:30 at night</TIME>. 
</P>
<P>
You are surprised the genii of college football have stopped at eight games. 
Between <TIME>midnight</TIME> and <TIME>8 a.m.</TIME>, they could book two more. 
</P>
<P>
And, of course, they could squeeze in another in prime time. 
</P>
<P>
Right now, they have arranged so many games <DATE>Jan. 1</DATE> that an overlap occurs. For 
instance, the Citrus Bowl, the Cotton Bowl and the <PERSON>Hall</PERSON> of Fame Bowl poach on 
each other's telecast. 
</P>
<P>
And all three arrive on the air at some time during the second half of the 
Gator Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange Bowl and the Sugar Bowl overlap, same as the Fiesta Bowl and the 
Rose Bowl. And all are coming off a previous day of activity featuring the <PERSON>John 
Hancock</PERSON> Bowl and the <LOCATION>Domino</LOCATION>'s Pizza Copper Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
A confused viewer of those two could leave his set believing he will be insured 
in 30 minutes, or the policy is free. 
</P>
<P>
You are a tolerant individual. You are patient and understanding, the milk of 
human kindness flowing by the liter through every vein. 
</P>
<P>
You are not aiming to rock the vessel. All you are trying to comprehend is 
whether college football has gone foaming-at-the-mouth mad. 
</P>
<P>
One isn't supposed to be dealing here with dummies. This is our highest 
intellectual order, the teachers of our young. 
</P>
<P>
And they allow a circumstance on New Year's Day calling for eight televised 
bowl games? 
</P>
<P>
If smart guys permit this excess, what would imbeciles do? 
</P>
<P>
So what has all this done to that spectacle billing itself as "the Granddaddy 
of 'Em All," the Rose Bowl? 
</P>
<P>
What it has done is reduce the Rose Bowl to selling nothing but age -- a game 
beginning in <DATE>1902</DATE> and continuing to the present, with intermittent stoppages. 
</P>
<P>
After the <DATE>1902</DATE> game, for instance, it stopped until <DATE>1916</DATE>, substituting that 
well-known ghetto sport, polo. It also tried chariot races. 
</P>
<P>
And then the Rose Bowl ground to a halt in <LOCATION>Pasadena</LOCATION> in <DATE>1942</DATE> when the game was 
shifted to <LOCATION>Durham</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.C</LOCATION>. It was a war year, and <LOCATION>Pasadena</LOCATION> feared an air attack by 
the Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
What an insult to the <ORGANIZATION>Luftwaffe</ORGANIZATION> to OK the game on the <LOCATION>East Coast</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Although it was once the premier postseason game, the Rose Bowl has suffered 
serious slippage, not at the box office, but in the television ratings and in 
general prestige. 
</P>
<P>
And the ultimate contempt has been the willingness of other bowls to go 
head-and-head with it on TV. 
</P>
<P>
Offering <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION> this time, the Rose Bowl needn't necessarily 
apologize. <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, on a good day, can knock off any amateur team in the 
hemisphere. 
</P>
<P>
And <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION> is better than average. 
</P>
<P>
But it has become increasingly rare that connoisseurs about the land judge the 
Rose Bowl as an event of major national impact. It is more a parochial little 
war between the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> 10 and the <PERSON>Big Ten</PERSON>, pretty much like <ORGANIZATION>Eton</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Harrow</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Since the Rose Bowl still dredges more money from television than any other 
bowl game -- that could be a fleeting condition -- it behooves the promoters 
each year to capture participants of muscle, teams with substantial followings. 
</P>
<P>
Those teams preferred are <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Ohio State</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION> are rated fair. What <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION> lives in fear of is, say, <ORGANIZATION>Oregon 
State</ORGANIZATION> vs. <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Bucking seven other games New Year's Day, with such a matchup the network 
starts looking for a bridge. 
</P>
<P>
One is available in <LOCATION>Pasadena</LOCATION>, making the Rose Bowl a game of convenience, if 
nothing else.

roses went to <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> as the glut of college bowls wound up with an 
extravaganza of seven games <DATE>Monday</DATE>.

at <LOCATION>Orlando</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla.</LOCATION>, and No. 17 Syracuse dominated No. 16 <ORGANIZATION>Louisiana State</ORGANIZATION>, 23-10,

and No. 4 <ORGANIZATION>Florida State</ORGANIZATION> faced No. 7 Auburn in the Sugar Bowl at <LOCATION>New Orleans</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Notre Dame</ORGANIZATION> will likely receive its first national title since <DATE>1977 today</DATE> when 
the <ORGANIZATION>Associated Press</ORGANIZATION>' final poll of the media is released. Coach <PERSON>Lou Holtz</PERSON> will 
join Irish coaches <PERSON>Frank Leahy</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Ara Parseghian</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Dan Devine</PERSON> in winning 
national titles in their third seasons at <LOCATION>Notre Dame</LOCATION>.

in <DATE>1977</DATE>. <ORGANIZATION>Knute Rockne</ORGANIZATION> won 6 other national titles before the AP poll began in 
<DATE>1936</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Junior quarterback <PERSON>Tony Rice</PERSON> led the way for <ORGANIZATION>Notre Dame</ORGANIZATION>, passing for 2 
touchdowns and a career-high 213 yards. Rice also rushed for 75 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame built a 23-6 half-time lead, and <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION> (11-1) had to settle 
for the first 11-victory season in its 96-year football history. 
</P>
<P>
USC (10-2) had a 14-3 half-time lead but was overpowered by <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> (9-2-1) in 
the <DATE>second half</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
The victory gave <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> Coach <PERSON>Bo Schembechler</PERSON> only his second victory in nine 
trips to the Rose Bowl and marked the first time the <ORGANIZATION>Big Ten</ORGANIZATION> had won 
consecutive Rose Bowls since the 1964-65 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Michigan State</ORGANIZATION> defeated <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION>, <DATE>20-17</DATE>, last year. 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> fullback <PERSON>Leroy Hoard</PERSON> rushed for 142 yards and scored two 
<DATE>fourth-quarter</DATE> touchdowns. Hoard put the <LOCATION>Wolverines</LOCATION> ahead, 15-14, with a 1-yard 
touchdown run early in the final period, then locked up the victory with 
another 1-yard scoring run with 1:52 left. He set up the last touchdown with a 
61-yard gain to the Trojan 9. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback <PERSON>Rodney Peete</PERSON>, frustrated most of the game by the <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> defense, 
scored for <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION> on runs of 1 and 4 yards. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA (10-2) used the efficiency of quarterback <PERSON>Troy Aikman</PERSON> and an overpowering 
defense to become the first school ever to win bowl games in 7 consecutive 
seasons -- all with <PERSON>Terry Donahue</PERSON> as coach -- before a partisan <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION> crowd 
of 74,304. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins' victory streak also includes 3 Rose Bowls, a Fiesta Bowl, an Aloha 
Bowl and a Freedom Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Aikman completed 19 of 27 passes for 172 yards and a touchdown, and converted 
12 of 20 third-down situations into first downs. Freshman <PERSON>Shawn Wills</PERSON> gained 
121 yards in 18 carries. 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>Dallas Cowboys</ORGANIZATION> are expected to make <PERSON>Aikman</PERSON> their first pick of the <ORGANIZATION>National 
Football League</ORGANIZATION> draft. Cowboy personnel director <PERSON>Gil Brandt</PERSON> congratulated 
<PERSON>Aikman</PERSON> under the goal posts after the game. 
</P>
<P>
However, it was the <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION> defense that carried the day, holding <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION> (10-2) 
to 42 yards of offense and 4 first downs.

MELVIN DURSLAG: GRANDDAD GETTING BOWLED OVER

<TEXT>
<P>
The way life measures up in matters postseason, <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> or <ORGANIZATION>Ohio State</ORGANIZATION> or 
<ORGANIZATION>Illinois</ORGANIZATION> will be matched against <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION> in the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
ABC, which produces an inordinate amount of cash to televise the game, exhales 
deeply. 
</P>
<P>
"Thank you, heaven," it says. "But for this blessing, it could have been 
<LOCATION>Washington State</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION>." 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to cutthroat New Year's Day football, now featuring seven games, 
the network doing the <ORGANIZATION>Rose Bowl</ORGANIZATION> is made to perspire, no longer sitting atop an 
automatic hit. 
</P>
<P>
Faded elegance, the Rose Bowl rarely offers the prime game, meaning those who 
promote it, or televise it, must hope, at least, for principals with wide 
followings. 
</P>
<P>
On the <LOCATION>West Coast</LOCATION>, that would be <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION>. In the <ORGANIZATION>Big Ten</ORGANIZATION>, it would be 
<LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Ohio State</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
But competition in the leagues has so deteriorated that the Rose Bowl, locked 
in with the two, is beginning to lose the carbonation that has given fizz to 
its match for so long. 
</P>
<P>
Normally today, you write off half the teams, or more, in each conference at 
the start of the season. And, by the end, you are looking pretty much at the 
same colors, mostly belonging to <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION> on one side and <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Ohio 
State</ORGANIZATION> on the other. 
</P>
<P>
On <DATE>Jan. 1</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION> will have graced the scene three years in a row. And an audit 
discloses that over the <DATE>last 20 years</DATE>, the visiting force has been <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> or 
<ORGANIZATION>Ohio State</ORGANIZATION> 16 times. 
</P>
<P>
The monotony suggests a period in <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> in which all the bit shooters drove 
Cadillacs. You never asked a man what kind of car he bought. You merely 
inquired, "What color?" 
</P>
<P>
The Rose Bowl bills itself as the Granddaddy of Them All, a tribute more to its 
age than its impact. It sells out, almost unfailingly, and its financial health 
is good. 
</P>
<P>
But all too often on the New Year's card, it is the tap dancer supplementing 
the headline act. In vaudeville, <PERSON>Fink</PERSON>'s Mules warmed up audiences as the Rose 
Bowl does today. 
</P>
<P>
Little old ladies in <LOCATION>Pasadena</LOCATION> don't like it. Over gin the other day, one was 
heard to grumble: "We are being upstaged by something called the <ORGANIZATION>Federal 
Express Orange Bowl</ORGANIZATION>. What the hell is the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Express</ORGANIZATION> Orange Bowl?" 
</P>
<P>
"Are you sure it isn't pony express?" another asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Pony express may be sponsoring a game in <LOCATION>Fresno</LOCATION>." 
</P>
<P>
Operating the only major postseason game that is totally committed to two 
conferences, the Rose Bowl shuts itself off from teams that may be interesting 
that particular season. 
</P>
<P>
"But we don't have to enter the dogfight," the Rose Bowl explains. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, it doesn't. And, sidestepping the dogfight, it has wound up in the 
water closet, with TV ratings that have slipped and with such contempt 
developed by competitors for the Granddaddy of Them All that they have dared 
take it on, head to head, on the air. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, who would have been so audacious, so consummately brassy as to 
overlap the Rose Bowl? Would some hillbilly try to win a singing contest from 
<LOCATION>Pavarotti</LOCATION>? 
</P>
<P>
"Look," you say gingerly to <LOCATION>Pasadena</LOCATION>. "Maybe the time has come to forget the 
lock-in and start thinking about the dogfight. Rose Bowl money can lick a lot 
of dogs." 
</P>
<P>
"We cherish our relationship with the <ORGANIZATION>Big Ten</ORGANIZATION> and Pacific 10," <LOCATION>Pasadena</LOCATION> lashes 
back. "It has stood since <DATE>1947</DATE>." 
</P>
<P>
"A newspaper we remember stood since <DATE>1903</DATE>," <LOCATION>Pasadena</LOCATION> is reminded. "It isn't 
with us anymore." 
</P>
<P>
"But our two conferences have stature and they have character," <LOCATION>Pasadena</LOCATION> 
responds. "They embody everything that is good in institutions of learning." 
</P>
<P>
"Are you selling learning or football?" you reply. "This is show business. And 
the same teams coming in every year are getting to be a yawn. Do you know what 
killed the six-day bike race? Its act never changed. And the same thing one day 
will kill Old Faithful at Yellowstone." 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>Pasadena</LOCATION> used to be more inventive. Offering its first bowl game in <DATE>1902</DATE>, it 
shut it down as bad theater when <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> creamed <ORGANIZATION>Stanford</ORGANIZATION>, 49-0. 
</P>
<P>
Do you know what <LOCATION>Pasadena</LOCATION> came up with the next year? A polo match. That seemed 
a good idea, inasmuch as no team, up to that point, had lost 49-0 in polo. 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena then tried an ostrich race, followed by a race between a camel and an 
elephant. It also came on with a tug of war, which, today, might be called the 
<PERSON>John Hancock</PERSON> Tug of War. And, by <DATE>1916</DATE>, it was ready again for football. 
</P>
<P>
In postseason play, the Rose Bowl is sitting in on a high-stakes poker game. To 
succeed, folks there must produce more than a fund of happy recollections on 
how the pot used to be theirs.

<P>
Notre Dame staked a claim to its 14th national football championship, and the 
roses went to <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> as the glut of college bowls wound up with an 
extravaganza of seven games <DATE>Monday</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
The top-ranked Fighting Irish completed the first 12-0 season in their storied 
football history with a 34-21 victory over third-ranked, previously undefeated 
<LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION> in the <LOCATION>Fiesta Bowl</LOCATION> at <LOCATION>Tempe</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ariz.</LOCATION>, and the 11th-ranked 
Wolverines rallied in the second half to beat fifth-ranked <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION>, 22-14, in the 
75th Rose Bowl at <LOCATION>Pasadena</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Ninth-ranked <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION> upheld the honor of the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> 10 Conference, winning a 
record seventh straight bowl game by downing eighth-ranked <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION>, 17-3, in 
the Cotton Bowl at <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Florida State</ORGANIZATION> Win 
</P>
<P>
In night games, No. 2 <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>, which lost only to <ORGANIZATION>Notre Dame</ORGANIZATION>, routed No. 6 
<LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION>, 23-3, in the Orange Bowl at <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>, and No. 4 <ORGANIZATION>Florida State</ORGANIZATION> held off 
No. 7 <LOCATION>Auburn</LOCATION>, 13-7, in the Sugar Bowl at <LOCATION>New Orleans</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
In other games, No. 13 Clemson beat No. 10 <LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION>, 13-6, in the <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> 
Citrus Bowl at <LOCATION>Orlando</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla.</LOCATION>, and No. 17 Syracuse dominated No. 16 <ORGANIZATION>Louisiana 
State</ORGANIZATION>, 23-10, in the <PERSON>Hall</PERSON> of Fame Bowl at <LOCATION>Tampa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Notre Dame</ORGANIZATION> will likely receive its first national title since <DATE>1977 today</DATE> when 
the <ORGANIZATION>Associated Press</ORGANIZATION>' final poll of the media is released. Coach <PERSON>Lou Holtz</PERSON> will 
join Irish coaches <PERSON>Frank Leahy</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Ara Parseghian</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Dan Devine</PERSON> in winning 
national titles in their third seasons at <LOCATION>Notre Dame</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Leahy won in <DATE>1943</DATE>, <DATE>1946</DATE>, <DATE>1947</DATE> and <DATE>1949</DATE>, Parseghian in <DATE>1966</DATE> and <DATE>1973</DATE>, and <PERSON>Devine</PERSON> 
in <DATE>1977</DATE>. <ORGANIZATION>Knute Rockne</ORGANIZATION> won six other national titles before the AP poll began in 
<DATE>1936</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Junior quarterback <PERSON>Tony Rice</PERSON> led the way for <ORGANIZATION>Notre Dame</ORGANIZATION>, passing for two 
touchdowns and a career-high 213 yards. Rice also rushed for 75 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame built a 23-6 half-time lead, and <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION> (11-1) had to settle 
for the first 11-victory season in its 96-year football history. 
</P>
<P>
USC (10-2) had a 14-3 half-time lead but was overpowered by <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> (9-2-1) in 
the <DATE>second half</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Second Victory in Nine Trips 
</P>
<P>
The victory gave <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> Coach <PERSON>Bo Schembechler</PERSON> only his second victory in nine 
trips to the Rose Bowl and marked the first time the <ORGANIZATION>Big Ten</ORGANIZATION> had won 
consecutive Rose Bowls since the 1964-65 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Michigan State</ORGANIZATION> defeated <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION>, <DATE>20-17</DATE>, last year. 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> fullback <PERSON>Leroy Hoard</PERSON> rushed for 142 yards and scored two 
<DATE>fourth-quarter</DATE> touchdowns. Hoard put the <LOCATION>Wolverines</LOCATION> ahead, 15-14, with a 1-yard 
touchdown run early in the final period, then locked up the victory with 
another 1-yard scoring run with 1:52 left. He set up the last touchdown with a 
61-yard gain to the Trojan 9. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback <PERSON>Rodney Peete</PERSON>, frustrated most of the game by the <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> defense, 
scored for <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION> on runs of 1 and 4 yards. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA (10-2) used the efficiency of quarterback <PERSON>Troy Aikman</PERSON> and an overpowering 
defense to become the first school ever to win bowl games in seven consecutive 
seasons -- all with <PERSON>Terry Donahue</PERSON> as coach -- before a partisan <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION> crowd 
of 74,304. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Several Bowls Involved 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins' victory streak also includes three Rose Bowls, a Fiesta Bowl, an 
Aloha Bowl and a Freedom Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Aikman completed 19 of 27 passes for 172 yards and a touchdown, and converted 
12 of 20 third-down situations into first downs. Freshman <PERSON>Shawn Wills</PERSON> gained 
121 yards in 18 carries against the Razorbacks (10-2). 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>Dallas Cowboys</ORGANIZATION> are expected to make <PERSON>Aikman</PERSON> the first player chosen in the 
<ORGANIZATION>National Football League</ORGANIZATION> draft. Cowboy personnel director <PERSON>Gil Brandt</PERSON> 
congratulated <PERSON>Aikman</PERSON> under the goal posts after the game. 
</P>
<P>
However, it was the <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION> defense that carried the day, holding <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION> to 42 
yards of offense and four first downs.

<P>
NBC's telecast of the <LOCATION>Fiesta Bowl</LOCATION> football game between national champion <ORGANIZATION>Notre 
Dame</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION> on <DATE>Jan. 2</DATE> drew a 17.0 national rating, the highest of 
any bowl game this year, the network said. 
</P>
<P>
Playing opposite the Fiesta Bowl, <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION>'s Rose Bowl had a 10.8 rating, lowest in 
the television history of the game, <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION> said. 
</P>
<P>
The rating means an average of <PERCENT>17%</PERCENT> of all <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> TV households were tuned into 
the Fiesta Bowl, or about 15.4 million households. 
</P>
<P>
"The Fiesta Bowl, of course, was for the national championship, and it was the 
highest-rated of the year, facing what traditionally is the highest-rated bowl 
game," <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION> research specialist <PERSON>Gray Seamans</PERSON> said. "And we beat it handily -- by 
<PERCENT>57%</PERCENT>." 
</P>
<P>
CBS' Cotton Bowl, in which <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION> defeated <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION>, drew a 9.8 rating, lowest in 
its history, and the <PERSON>Hall</PERSON> of Fame Bowl on <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION> had an 8.1. The Citrus Bowl, on 
<ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION>, had a 7.2 rating. 
</P>
<P>
National ratings were announced earlier for <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION>'s Orange Bowl, 12.8, and <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION>'s 
Sugar Bowl, 8.1, which were shown against one another in prime time. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Seamans</PERSON> said the highest-rated bowl game ever was the Orange Bowl's national 
championship showdown 2 years ago, which had a 25.1 rating.

A BIG DAY FOR BOWL GAMES AND PARADES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE LINAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Today's an especially big day for football bowl games, but what about those who 
love a parade? 
</P>
<P>
At <TIME>8 a.m.</TIME>, the TV networks and local stations both will serve up live coverage 
of the 100th "Tournament of Roses Parade" from <LOCATION>Pasadena</LOCATION>. The grand marshal is 
<PERSON>Shirley Temple Black</PERSON>, who also presided over the event 50 years ago in <DATE>1939</DATE> 
when she was a child star. 
</P>
<P>
The parade will be shown on CBS (where the hosts will be <PERSON>Patrick Duffy</PERSON> and Joan

and <PERSON>Maria Elena Salinas</PERSON>). 
</P>
<P>
There are also chances to catch the parade later in the day on repeat 
telecasts: at <TIME>10:30 a.m.</TIME> (5)(11), at <TIME>6 p.m.</TIME> (11) and at <TIME>7:30 p.m.</TIME> (5). 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> also boasts a New Year's Parade, and <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION> will be there to cover the 32nd 
annual "Cotton Bowl Parade" from <TIME>2-3 p.m.</TIME> (2)(8). 
</P>
<P>
Moving to the football field, here's a listing of the day's bowl games:

TELEVISION: A HARD DAY'S NIGHT OF FOOTBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Yes, there can be too much football. 
</P>
<P>
There was some good football on New Year's Day -- particularly for <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Notre 
Dame</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> fans -- but seven games in one day is about four too many. 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> presents a nice, neat postseason tournament, culminating with Super 
Bowl <DATE>Sunday</DATE>. What the colleges present is a mess. 
</P>
<P>
Watching seven games within an 11-hour span is enough to make your head spin 
more than a New Year's Day hangover. 
</P>
<P>
The first game <DATE>Monday</DATE> was the <ORGANIZATION>Hall of Fame Bowl</ORGANIZATION>, which began shortly after <TIME>10 
a.m</TIME>. The last one, the Sugar Bowl, didn't end until <TIME>9:15 p.m.</TIME> 
</P>
<P>
ABC made the most of its late sign-off and asked viewers to call in their votes 
for the No. 1 team in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
At last count, <ORGANIZATION>Notre Dame</ORGANIZATION> had a pretty healthy lead over <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>, <PERCENT>55%</PERCENT> to <PERCENT>26%</PERCENT>, 
after 50,000 calls. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION> each televised three games and <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION> one. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION> got a head start on <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION> with the <ORGANIZATION>Hall of Fame Bowl</ORGANIZATION> starting a half-hour 
earlier than the Citrus Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION> had to cut away from its coverage of the Rose Parade a little early, but at 
least it didn't run into the overlapping problems later in the day that <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION> 
did. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Hall</PERSON> of Fame Bowl ended at <TIME>1:27 p.m.</TIME> and the network wasted little time 
switching to the <LOCATION>Fiesta Bowl</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
It was a far better switch than <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION>'s from the <LOCATION>Citrus Bowl</LOCATION> to the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
ABC planned to be on the air from <LOCATION>Pasadena</LOCATION> at <TIME>1:45 p.m.</TIME>, and the kickoff was 
scheduled for shortly after 2. 
</P>
<P>
But, as things turned out, the kickoff was delayed until 2:21. 
</P>
<P>
The main reason for the delay was that the Citrus Bowl didn't end until 2:03. 
Then, making matters worse, <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION> took its time making the switch, to say the 
least. 
</P>
<P>
After the <LOCATION>Citrus Bowl</LOCATION> was over, <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION> showed a promotional spot for the upcoming 
Rose Bowl. Thanks, but we knew it was coming. 
</P>
<P>
Then came a promo for <ORGANIZATION>ABC Sports</ORGANIZATION>, then a "thank you" promotional spot to an 
airline that provides free air travel. 
</P>
<P>
There were two promos for <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION> shows, followed by a news brief. 
</P>
<P>
It was almost 2:10. 
</P>
<P>
What next? Three consecutive commercials and a Channel 7 promo for <PERSON>Todd 
Donoho</PERSON>'s "New Year's Live" postgame show. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, <PERSON>Donoho</PERSON>'s show wasn't bad. He played it pretty straight, and his 
look-a-likes segment was interesting. <PERSON>John Robinson</PERSON> and <PERSON>Duke Snider</PERSON> was one of 
his best. 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION> was still a long way from the Rose Bowl kickoff. 
</P>
<P>
After some <ORGANIZATION>ABC Sports</ORGANIZATION> graphics, there was a Big Ten promo, then more graphics 
and finally a glimpse of the <LOCATION>Rose Bowl</LOCATION>, where the crowd was completing the 
national anthem. 
</P>
<P>
Then came an intro from announcer <PERSON>Keith Jackson</PERSON> and another taped piece on 
<PERSON>Schembechler</PERSON>, this one showing a <DATE>1971</DATE> pep talk. 
</P>
<P>
Next was another commercial, then a Pacific 10 promo followed by one more 
commercial. 
</P>
<P>
At 2:16, the teams took the field, and <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON> and commentator <PERSON>Bob Griese</PERSON> 
offered a little pregame analysis. 
</P>
<P>
The Rose Bowl kickoff came 18 minutes after the end of the Citrus Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
ABC had met with Rose Bowl officials at about <TIME>1 p.m.</TIME> and asked for a later 
kickoff, so the teams knew what was coming. 
</P>
<P>
But it was unnerving to viewers at home and fans at the game, making them wait 
and wait. 
</P>
<P>
The 18-minute break wouldn't have been so bad had <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION> not crammed in all those 
commercials and promos. 
</P>
<P>
There were 20 minutes between the <LOCATION>Fiesta Bowl</LOCATION> and Orange Bowl on <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION>, but that 
network used the time mostly for analysis and features. 
</P>
<P>
It used the time for only a few commercials and promos. 
</P>
<P>
ABC producer <PERSON>Bob Goodrich</PERSON>, who was in charge of the Rose Bowl coverage, had 
plenty of material planned for his pregame show, but someone higher up at <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION> 
decided against using it. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, <PERSON>Goodrich</PERSON>, director <PERSON>Larry Kamm</PERSON>, announcers <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON> and <PERSON>Griese</PERSON> and the 
rest of the <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION> crew put out an excellent Rose Bowl telecast -- once it got 
going. 
</P>
<P>
ABC got some definitive shots the holding call on <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>'s fake punt in the 
<DATE>fourth quarter</DATE>, but the most conclusive shot wasn't shown until halftime of the 
Sugar Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
It showed that <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Bobby Abrams</PERSON> held, but it was far away from the play 
and the flag was late. 
</P>
<P>
Usually sideline reporters offer little, but <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>O.J. Simpson</PERSON> came up with 
some good information during the Orange Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Simpson, working the <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION> sideline while <PERSON>Ralph Wiley</PERSON> handled the <LOCATION>Notre Dame</LOCATION> 
bench, explained why the entire teams of both schools went on the field before 
the kickoff. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Simpson</PERSON> said when the <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION> players saw the whole <ORGANIZATION>Notre Dame</ORGANIZATION> team coming 
out, they did the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
Simpson also explained what went wrong on <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION>'s fake field goal try early 
in the game, pointing out that the key receiver forgot to run a pattern. 
</P>
<P>
In the Orange Bowl booth, <PERSON>Dick Enberg</PERSON> and <PERSON>Bill Walsh</PERSON> had one of their best 
games. It was refreshing to hear how excited <PERSON>Walsh</PERSON> was. 
</P>
<P>
He even apologized for a profanity. Actually, all he said was 'that was a 
helluva play." 
</P>
<P>
Viewers of the <ORGANIZATION>Hall of Fame Bowl</ORGANIZATION> saw one of the all-time hits when <ORGANIZATION>Ohio State</ORGANIZATION>'s 
<PERSON>Zack Dumas</PERSON> leveled <ORGANIZATION>Auburn</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Stacy Danley</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
Announcer <PERSON>Don Criqui</PERSON> first said: "That's got to be the hardest hit of the 
'89-90 bowl season." 
</P>
<P>
Then, after viewing a replay, <PERSON>Criqui</PERSON> said: "It's the hardest hit I've seen in 
football in years." 
</P>
<P>
Criqui at one point forgot he was at the <PERSON>Hall</PERSON> of Fame Bowl. Talking about 
<ORGANIZATION>Auburn</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Shayne Wasden</PERSON>'s punt returns of 30 and 34 yards, he said they broke 
the Orange Bowl record. 
</P>
<P>
Well, maybe you can't blame <PERSON>Criqui</PERSON> for being confused. He worked the last eight 
Orange Bowl games. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of flubs, <PERSON>Simpson</PERSON>, during halftime of the <PERSON>Hall</PERSON> of Fame Bowl, referred 
to <LOCATION>Notre Dame</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>George Gipp</PERSON> as <PERSON>George Kemp</PERSON>. However, <PERSON>Simpson</PERSON> did catch the 
mistake and corrected it. 
</P>
<P>
In referring to <PERSON>Gipp</PERSON>'s death, comparing it to the death of <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION> quarterback 
<PERSON>Sal Aunese</PERSON>, <PERSON>Simpson</PERSON> said it occurred a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Colleague <PERSON>Bob Costas</PERSON>, fearing <PERSON>Simpson</PERSON>'s attempt at sarcasm was probably lost on 
most viewers, added: "It was more than a few years ago. It was so long ago that 
a young <PERSON>Ronald Reagan</PERSON> could play <PERSON>Gipp</PERSON> (in the <DATE>1940</DATE> movie, '<ORGANIZATION>Knute Rockne</ORGANIZATION> -- All 
American')." 
</P>
<P>
During halftime of the Fiesta Bowl, <PERSON>Gayle Gardner</PERSON> -- yes, she still works for 
<ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION> -- had an excellent feature on the once-troubled <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION> football program 
and the death of <LOCATION>Aunese</LOCATION> <DATE>last September</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
CBS deserves kudos for the halftime piece it showed during the Cotton Bowl. It 
chronicled the highlights of college football during the <DATE>1980s</DATE>, including 
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION>'s <DATE>1982</DATE> kickoff against <ORGANIZATION>Stanford</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION> broke a story <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME> that <ORGANIZATION>Notre Dame</ORGANIZATION> defensive coordinator <PERSON>Barry 
Alvarez</PERSON> would be leaving the school to become head coach at <LOCATION>Wisconsin</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The network had <PERSON>Wiley</PERSON> interview <PERSON>Alvarez</PERSON> later in the day, but because of 
technical problems, had to cut away from it earlier than planned. 
</P>
<P>
On <TIME>this day and night</TIME> of football, the coverage and the announcing, overall, 
was fine. 
</P>
<P>
It's just that something needs to be done about the logjam. The way things are 
now, it's impossible to see everything. 
</P>
<P>
And that's depriving viewers. You don't see the <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> scheduling seven games on 
Super Bowl <DATE>Sunday</DATE>.

<LEADPARA>  For those needing an early jump on their New Year's Day plans, the options may
include watching Cal's football team.;   The Bears, for now, are being watched
by executives from the upper tier of Jan. 1 games -- the Fiesta, Orange,
Florida Citrus and Sugar bowls -- with executives of less prestigious games --
the Hall of Fame is one -- ready to step in if the bigger bowls lose interest.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Sports  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  IT'S NOT TOO EARLY FOR CAL FANS TO THINK ABOUT NEW
YEAR'S DAY  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Chart attached to the end of this article  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Granted, the distinction of playing on <LOCATION>New Year</LOCATION>'s Day has lost some of its
luster with eight -- yes, eight -- bowl games on the day's schedule. So to say
<LOCATION>Cal</LOCATION> could be playing in a New Year's Day bowl game, as <PERSON>Brent Musburger</PERSON> did
during <LOCATION>Cal</LOCATION>'s 24-17 loss to <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, still begs for some narrowing of the
scope.;   The only way to glean a Rose Bowl invitation, of course, is to win
the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> 10 Conference championship, which appears headed for Washington.; 
 The Orange also could take some work, because its selection committee uses
three criteria -- national ranking, television audience and fan support -- to
choose an at-large opponent for the Big Eight champion. The Bears were on last
week's Orange Bowl list of 16 and made this week's cut to 12.;   But <LOCATION>Cal</LOCATION> would
have to be ranked very high -- probably meaning the top three or four -- to
offset questions about its fan base and television appeal, an Orange Bowl
representative said. A group of 7,500 <LOCATION>Cal</LOCATION> fans traveled to <LOCATION>Tucson</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ariz.</LOCATION>, for
last year's Copper Bowl, a <LOCATION>Cal</LOCATION> spokesman said.;   If <LOCATION>Cal</LOCATION> can avoid losing
before <DATE>Nov. 17</DATE>, the day bowl bids are delivered, the Bears could net games as
lucrative as the Sugar Bowl, which offers <MONEY>$3.365 million</MONEY> to each team, or the
Fiesta Bowl, which has a <MONEY>$2 million</MONEY> payout. The bid date means the Bears' bowl
hopes should be decided before the <ORGANIZATION>Stanford</ORGANIZATION> game.;   "We would consider a team
that finished tied for the league championship or lost competitively to the
top team and finished 10-1, depending on how the other bowl possibilities
would be," Fiesta representative <PERSON>Wayne Goodrich</PERSON> said. "We have roots in the
Pac-10. A school like <LOCATION>Cal</LOCATION> would have a presence on the day of our game.";  
Said <PERSON>Troy Mathieu</PERSON>, assistant executive director of the Sugar Bowl: "At this
point it's very early, but we are interested in the Pac-10 runner-up. . . .
Our game follows the Rose Bowl on <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION>, (so) having a Pac-10 team in a bowl
game keeps the fans tuned in. But it's still early.";   The Citrus Bowl has a
soft spot for "Cinderella" teams such as <LOCATION>Cal</LOCATION>, Citrus president <PERSON>Bob Moore</PERSON> said,
but there's concern about how many Bears fans would go to <LOCATION>Orlando</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla.</LOCATION>, to
attend the game. The crowd enthusiasm against <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> helped allay that
worry, particularly with a Citrus Bowl representative in attendance, but the
Citrus committee also will look at how many fans go to <LOCATION>Cal</LOCATION>'s Pac-10 games on
the road.;   It's too early for the <PERSON>Hall</PERSON> of Fame Bowl to put together a list,
said <PERSON>Jim McVay</PERSON>, the bowl's executive director, but <LOCATION>Cal</LOCATION> certainly has his
attention.;   "There are a lot of pluses," <PERSON>McVay</PERSON> said. "Great players, good
reputation, hell of a team. There aren't any negatives."; <LOCATION>CAL</LOCATION>'S NEW YEAR'S DAY

Even before <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> knocked off top-ranked <ORGANIZATION>Notre Dame</ORGANIZATION>, 27-10, <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>, the 
Hurricanes and Fighting Irish accepted bids to New Year's Day bowl games. 
</P>
<P>
However, seventh-ranked <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>'s victory over the Irish spoiled the Orange 
Bowl's hoped-for showdown for the national championship between <ORGANIZATION>Notre Dame</ORGANIZATION> 
(11-1) and second-ranked <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION> (11-0), which earned an automatic berth by 
winning the <ORGANIZATION>Big Eight Conference</ORGANIZATION> championship outright for the first time since 
<DATE>1961</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Notre Dame Athletic</ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON>Dick Rosenthal</PERSON> said the Irish accepted the Orange 
Bowl bid because they haven't played in the New Year's Night game since <DATE>1975</DATE>. 
<PERSON>Rosenthal</PERSON> said the Fighting Irish also considered bids from the Sugar, <ORGANIZATION>Cotton</ORGANIZATION>, 
Fiesta and Citrus Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
Because the game is at night, the Orange Bowl could still get its showdown if 
things break just right earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
Colorado last played in the <LOCATION>Orange Bowl</LOCATION> in <DATE>1977</DATE>, when it was Big Eight 
co-champion. <LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION> or <LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION> has been the conference representative at 
<LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> every year since. 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> (10-1) accepted a bid to play the <ORGANIZATION>Southeastern Conference</ORGANIZATION> champion -- 
either No. 4 <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION> (10-0), No. 10 Auburn (8-2) or No. 8 <LOCATION>Tennessee</LOCATION> (9-1) -- in 
the Sugar Bowl in <LOCATION>New Orleans</LOCATION> on <DATE>Jan. 1</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION> runner-up, or possibly an <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION> co-champion that does not go to the Sugar 
Bowl, will play in the Cotton Bowl against ninth-ranked <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION> (9-2), the 
<ORGANIZATION>Southwest Conference</ORGANIZATION> champion. 
</P>
<P>
Third-ranked <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> (10-1) joined No. 12 USC (8-2-1), the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> 10 
Conference champion, in a rematch at the Rose Bowl in <LOCATION>Pasadena</LOCATION> by beating <ORGANIZATION>Ohio 
State</ORGANIZATION>, 28-18, to clinch the <ORGANIZATION>Big Ten Conference</ORGANIZATION> championship. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Ohio State</ORGANIZATION> (8-3) will play the odd team out in the <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Jan. 1</DATE> in the <PERSON>Hall</PERSON> of 
Fame Bowl at <LOCATION>Tampa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Fifth-ranked <ORGANIZATION>Florida State</ORGANIZATION> (8-2), the only team to beat <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>, will play No. 6 
<LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION> (10-1), which lost only to <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION>, in the <LOCATION>Fiesta Bowl</LOCATION> on <DATE>Jan. 1</DATE> at 
<LOCATION>Tempe</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ariz</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
No. 15 Clemson (9-2) will play No. 17 <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION> (9-2) <DATE>Dec. 30th</DATE> in the 
Gator Bowl at <LOCATION>Jacksonville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Big Ten runner-up and 11th-ranked Illinois (9-2) and <ORGANIZATION>Atlantic Coast Conference</ORGANIZATION> 
co-champion <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> (10-2), No. 16, accepted bids to play in the <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> 
Citrus Bowl on New Year's Day. Illinois lost only to <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION>. 
<LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> lost only to <LOCATION>Notre Dame</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Clemson</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The Freedom Bowl was hoping to invite <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION> and its All-American running back 
<PERSON>Anthony Thompson</PERSON>, but the Hooisers were upset, 15-14, <DATE>Saturday</DATE> by <ORGANIZATION>Purdue</ORGANIZATION>. So 
the game at <LOCATION>Anaheim Stadium</LOCATION> will have <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> (7-3) and <PERSON>Emmitt Smith</PERSON> against 
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> (7-4). 
</P>
<P>
No. 22 <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> (7-3-1) accepted an invitation to the Holiday Bowl <DATE>Dec. 29</DATE> 
against <ORGANIZATION>BYU</ORGANIZATION> after beating No. 19 <PERSON>Pitt</PERSON>, 16-13. 
</P>
<P>
'It won't be 16-13 (in the Holiday Bowl)," <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> said. "Maybe (BYU Coach) 
<PERSON>LaVell Edwards</PERSON> will take it easy because I'm his buddy. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Or maybe we'll throw and he'll run," added <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON>, drawing laughter because 
the suggestion went contrary to the teams' offensive philosophies. 
</P>
<P>
No. 21 BYU (10-2) clinched the Western Athletic Conference championship and the 
automatic berth in the Holiday Bowl that goes with it by beating <LOCATION>San Diego 
State</LOCATION>, <DATE>48-27</DATE>, <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> at <PERSON>Jack Murphy</PERSON> Stadium in <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> -- site of the 
Holiday Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Despite its defeat, <PERSON>Pitt</PERSON> (6-3-1) will play No. 14 <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> A&amp;M (7-3) in the 
<PERSON>John Hancock</PERSON> Bowl <DATE>Dec. 16</DATE> at <LOCATION>El Paso</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Georgia (6-4) will play Syracuse (6-4) in the <LOCATION>Peach Bowl</LOCATION> at <LOCATION>Atlanta Stadium</LOCATION> on 
<DATE>Dec. 30</DATE>. <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Syracuse</ORGANIZATION> each has one game remaining -- <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION> at 
archrival <ORGANIZATION>Georgia Tech</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Syracuse</ORGANIZATION> against <LOCATION>Louisville</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>. Both games are 
next weekend. 
</P>
<P>
No. 25 <ORGANIZATION>Michigan State</ORGANIZATION> (7-4), with losses to <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Notre Dame</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> and 
<LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>, won its fifth consecutive game <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, 31-3, over <LOCATION>Wisconsin</LOCATION>, to 
earn a spot in the <LOCATION>Aloha Bowl</LOCATION> on Christmas Day against No. 24 <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION> (8-2) in 
<LOCATION>Honolulu</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Mississippi (7-4) beat <LOCATION>Mississippi State</LOCATION>, 21-11, <DATE>Saturday</DATE> and accepted a bid to 
the Liberty Bowl on <DATE>Dec. 28</DATE> at <LOCATION>Memphis</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Tenn.</LOCATION>, against <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> (8-3). The 
Falcons were eliminated from the WAC race and Holiday Bowl consideration by 
<ORGANIZATION>BYU</ORGANIZATION>'s victory. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona (6-4-1), by beating archrival <ORGANIZATION>Arizona State</ORGANIZATION>, 28-10, on <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, will

<HEADLINE>  BOWLS ANNOUNCE THEIR CHOICES

WOULD GO WHERE  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Mercury News Staff Writer Ric Bucher contributed to this report.; Chart

<TEXT>     "To me, that was a farce," he said <DATE>Sunday</DATE> after the Hurricanes accepted a
bid from the Orange Bowl.;   "The bowl matchups were made I don't know how
long ago.";   Of course, nothing was supposed to be decided until noon <ORGANIZATION>PST</ORGANIZATION>
<DATE>Sunday</DATE>. Bowls are subject to a <MONEY>$250,000</MONEY> fine for breaking the deadline, but no
fines have been announced.;   The bowl selections have left some schools
disappointed and frustrated.;   No. 17 <LOCATION>Notre Dame</LOCATION>, despite a two-game losing
streak, will play No. 5 <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> in the Sugar Bowl.;   After <DATE>Saturday</DATE>'s 35-13
victory over <LOCATION>Notre Dame</LOCATION>, several <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> players were bitter that the bowl
deadline was broken to their detriment.;   "We thought that we should have
gone to the Sugar Bowl," wide receiver <PERSON>O.J. McDuffie</PERSON> said. "But if it's the
<LOCATION>Fiesta</LOCATION>, we're happy. We wanted a New Year's Day bowl game and got one. We're
satisfied.";   <LOCATION>Cal</LOCATION> also felt squeezed out of the Sugar Bowl picture.;   "I
think the only thing that is being hurt by that is the Sugar Bowl," said <LOCATION>Cal</LOCATION>
senior tight end Brent Woodall.;   "They are taking a team with a lesser
record. If they wanted to have the best game possible, they would have taken
the team with the highest ranking, and that's us.";   Cotton Bowl president
<PERSON>John Stuart</PERSON> said, "There's no perfect system -- you've got to start with that.
It's going to take a while to work all the kinks out.;   "From the fans'
standpoint, I hope it's going to get better.";   Next year things will change
as the bowl alliance begins. The Orange, <ORGANIZATION>Cotton</ORGANIZATION>, Sugar, Fiesta and Citrus have
aligned with five conferences and <ORGANIZATION>Notre Dame</ORGANIZATION> to divide the spots. The Rose
Bowl, which has not produced an undisputed national champion since <LOCATION>Southern
Cal</LOCATION> in <DATE>1972</DATE>, is tied to the <ORGANIZATION>Big Ten</ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> 10.;   Which of the
consortium's five bowls hosts the best game is determined by the rankings of
the champions of the <ORGANIZATION>Southwest</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Southeastern</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Big Eight Conferences</ORGANIZATION>. The
bowl connected with the highest-ranked champion -- the Sugar has the
<LOCATION>Southeastern</LOCATION>, the Cotton has the <ORGANIZATION>Southwest</ORGANIZATION>, and the Orange has the Big Eight
-- picks first from among the at-large teams. If the highest-ranked matchup is
among the at-large teams, then the Fiesta would host the premier game.;   But
even this solution won't solve all the problems.;   There would be nothing to
prevent the Sugar Bowl from selecting based on television ratings instead of
national rankings again, as it did this year by working out a deal with <ORGANIZATION>Notre
Dame</ORGANIZATION> instead of a higher-ranked team.;   "That's one of those items we'll just
have to feel out," <PERSON>Stuart</PERSON> said. "I think it happened this season for one
reason and one reason only -- they had to turn on TV sets. . . . I just see
the chances of stability as much greater."; BOWL GAMES AT A GLANCE; Bowl/

THE BOWL GAMES; 
</P>
<P>
ROSE BOWL; 
</P>
<P>
SCHEMBECHLER COULD USE LAST LAUGH AGAINST USC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAL FLORENCE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Whenever <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> Coach <PERSON>Bo Schembechler</PERSON> is reminded of his 1-7 record in the 
<LOCATION>Rose Bowl</LOCATION>, which is often, he jokes about it. 
</P>
<P>
It's a logical response, because he can't do anything now about what has 
happened in the past. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of his lighthearted comments, <PERSON>Schembechler</PERSON> would like to start 
chipping away at his record by beating <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION> today in the 75th renewal of the 
<ORGANIZATION>Rose Bowl</ORGANIZATION> game. 
</P>
<P>
USC Coach <PERSON>Larry Smith</PERSON> doesn't have such skeletons rattling in his coaching 
closet. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, there is a certain urgency for <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> to win today's game, 
considering that his Trojans lost to <ORGANIZATION>Michigan State</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>last year</DATE>'s Rose Bowl 
game in his first appearance as a head coach. It would also take some of the 
sting out of a regular-season ending loss to <LOCATION>Notre Dame</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
That defeat ranks as one of the most disappointing in 100 years of <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION> 
football. If USC (10-1) had won, it would be defending a No. 1 ranking in 
college football against <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION> quarterback <PERSON>Rodney Peete</PERSON> has said that it will be a long time before that 
defeat is little more than a memory. 
</P>
<P>
So how will the Trojans respond? Smith isn't sure. "We won't know until we come 
out on the field. We haven't been able to judge ourselves in that situation 
because it's the first time we've come off a loss this season," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As for <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> (8-2-1), the <LOCATION>Wolverines</LOCATION> could be a national championship 
contender today if it weren't for early season losses to <ORGANIZATION>Notre Dame</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> 
by a total of 3 points. 
</P>
<P>
Much has been written that the USC-Michigan matchup is a secondary bowl game, 
inasmuch as No. 1-ranked <LOCATION>Notre Dame</LOCATION> and No. 3 <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION> will be playing for 
the national championship in the <LOCATION>Fiesta Bowl</LOCATION> at about the same time. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, <PERSON>Schembechler</PERSON> and <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> contend that the "Granddaddy of them 
all," the Rose Bowl, doesn't take a back seat in viewing interest to any bowl. 
Subsequent television ratings will provide more insight. 
</P>
<P>
In any event, <DATE>today</DATE>'s Rose Bowl game has its intrinsic interest -- 
<PERSON>Schembechler</PERSON>'s albatross-like record along with the <ORGANIZATION>Big Ten</ORGANIZATION>'s failure here in 
recent years, losing 12 of the past 14 Rose Bowl games. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, there's the relationship between the coaches. <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> got his coaching 
start as a member of <PERSON>Schembechler</PERSON>'s staff at <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> of <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> in the 
late <DATE>1960s</DATE> and early <DATE>1970s</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
They've been friends ever since, and <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> attributes much of his coaching 
philosophy to his early apprenticeship under <PERSON>Schembechler</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Smith</PERSON> has lost only 5 games and won 18 in 2 seasons at <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION>. In those losses, 
Trojan turnovers were decisive. <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> says they will be a key factor today. 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> isn't likely to oblige, considering that quarterbacks <PERSON>Michael Taylor</PERSON> 
and <PERSON>Demetrius Brown</PERSON> have thrown only 2 interceptions and have lost only 8 
fumbles the entire season. 
</P>
<P>
With the notable exception of the <ORGANIZATION>Notre Dame</ORGANIZATION> game when <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION> had 4 turnovers, the 
Trojans haven't been error-prone. 
</P>
<P>
Peete has thrown 10 interceptions, but that's misleading, considering his 
entire offensive output. He has completed 208 of 338 passes (<PERCENT>61.5%</PERCENT>) for an 
average of 241.3 yards a game and 18 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>'s quarterbacks have attempted only 191 passes. The 
Wolverines are primarily a running team, featuring tailback <PERSON>Tony Boles</PERSON> and 
fullback <PERSON>Leroy Hoard</PERSON>, who are each averaging 5.5 yards a carry. 
</P>
<P>
"<LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> will not be taken out of its running game," <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> said. "They're 
better at it than any team we've played." 
</P>
<P>
However, the <LOCATION>Wolverines</LOCATION> may be forced to pass more often than in previous games 
considering the Trojans are No. 2-ranked nationally in rushing defense, 
allowing an average of only 76.6 yards a game. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION> has a more balanced offense, averaging 214.6 yards running and 247 yards 
passing compared with 256.6 and 153.4 for <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Both teams have what <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> calls bend-but-not-break defenses. <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> features 
one of the nation's best defensive linemen in tackle <PERSON>Mark Messner</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
However, <PERSON>Peete</PERSON>, who placed second to <ORGANIZATION>Oklahoma State</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Barry Sanders</PERSON> in the 
Heisman Trophy voting, seemingly provides <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION> with an edge in an otherwise even 
matchup. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Brown</PERSON> became the starting quarterback when <PERSON>Taylor</PERSON> suffered a broken collarbone 
in the ninth game of the season against <LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Brown</PERSON> had 16 interceptions last season, a factor in losing his starting job to 
<PERSON>Taylor</PERSON>. However, he hasn't been intercepted since replacing <PERSON>Taylor</PERSON>, completing 
<PERCENT>61.7%</PERCENT> of his passes for 5 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
It's <PERSON>Brown</PERSON>'s show today as <PERSON>Taylor</PERSON> was recently hospitalized with the flu and 
isn't expected to play. 
</P>
<P>
The Wolverines are aware of <ORGANIZATION>Peete</ORGANIZATION>'s capabilities. Said <PERSON>Messner</PERSON>: "He's very, 
very fast and he can beat you single-handedly." 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame had some success blitzing <PERSON>Peete</PERSON> in a 27-10 victory, and it wouldn't 
be surprising if <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> uses the same tactic. 
</P>
<P>
The Wolverines don't seem to be up-tight, perhaps reflecting the mood of their 
coach, who has been accommodating and apparently relaxed since the team's 
arrival here. 
</P>
<P>
As for his 1-7 Rose Bowl record, <PERSON>Schembechler</PERSON>, who has won more games than any 
other active college coach, dismisses it by saying: 
</P>
<P>
"If you win all the time, maybe you don't have as much appreciation for it. The 
thing that has balanced out my career is the fact I haven't been as successful 
in bowls. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had the same record I had in bowls as I do in the regular season, I'd 
probably be too cocky and have too big an ego." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rose Bowl Notes 
</P>
<P>
Kickoff for today's game is <TIME>2 p.m</TIME>. A crowd of 95,000 to 100,000 is expected. . 
. . USC is a 6 1/2-point favorite. Even though <PERSON>Aaron Emanuel</PERSON> has been <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION>'s 
most productive tailback in recent games, Coach <PERSON>Larry Smith</PERSON> said that <PERSON>Ricky 
Ervins</PERSON> would start today. "He has had excellent practices," <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> said of 
<PERSON>Ervins</PERSON>, "but all of our tailbacks will play." He was mainly referring to 
<PERSON>Ervins</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Emanuel</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Scott Lockwood</PERSON>. Smith would also like to use <PERSON>Steven Webster</PERSON> 
if possible. <PERSON>Webster</PERSON>, a senior, has missed virtually the entire season with 
injuries. . . . <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Wilbur Odom</PERSON>, a sophomore, who has played in only one 
game, will back up <PERSON>Demetrius Brown</PERSON> at quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
USC is ranked fifth in the polls, <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> 11th. . . . <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> concedes that 
<LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> has an edge over <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION> in the kicking game. <PERSON>Mike Gillette</PERSON>, a catcher on 
the baseball team, is averaging 40.4 yards on punts. He set a school record 
with his 56-yard field goal against <ORGANIZATION>Ohio State</ORGANIZATION>. USC punter <PERSON>Chris Sperle</PERSON> is 
averaging 38.3 yards, and <PERSON>Quin Rodriguez</PERSON> made 14 of 19 field goals, 7 for 7 
inside the 30-yard line. . . . <PERSON>Erik Affholter</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION>'s All-American split end, 
set schools records in the regular season for receptions in a season (63) and 
career (118). <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> has accomplished wide receivers in <PERSON>Greg McMurtry</PERSON>, <PERSON>Chris 
Calloway</PERSON> and <PERSON>John Kolesar</PERSON>. However, that group has had a total of only 67 
receptions on a run-oriented team. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>T.J. Osman</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>'s middle guard, on <PERSON>Bo Schembechler</PERSON>'s overall 4-11 bowl 
record: "He told us before we left that if we got a question about his bowl 
record to answer by saying that it's his record and not anything that we had to 
do with." . . . Asked to comment on <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> allowing 31 points against <ORGANIZATION>Ohio 
State</ORGANIZATION> in the second half of a final regular-season game, defensive tackle <PERSON>Mark 
Messner</PERSON> said: "We're still asking what happened. We had the same players and we 
were calling the same defenses, but they were going right through us." <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> 
won, though, 34-31, on a late, 41-yard pass from <PERSON>Brown</PERSON> to <PERSON>Kolesar</PERSON>. <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> is 
ranked ninth nationally in scoring defense, allowing an average of 13.9 points 
a game. . . . <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION> has a 3-1 record against <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> in the Rose Bowl and 3-3 
overall. The Trojans have an 18-7 Rose Bowl record. . . . <PERSON>Schembechler</PERSON> has lost 
only one Rose Bowl game by more than 8 points, a 24-14 loss to <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1983</DATE>.

MELVIN DURSLAG: TEACHING HOW DEALS ARE DONE

<P>
Those who administer college football are depressed. They aren't able to 
understand the money madness seizing the children who play the game. 
</P>
<P>
With eligibility left, the kids are going over the wall to join the pros. What 
has happened to the student-athlete? You ask one: 
</P>
<P>
"Are you interested in engineering?" 
</P>
<P>
"Indeed I am. I am dying to study the power plant of a Ferrari -- my Ferrari." 
</P>
<P>
It is regrettable that undergraduates in football don't have the healthy 
outlook of their university elders, who see the game as simple beauty, free 
from commercial pressure and general money-grubbing. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, colleges <DATE>today</DATE> play no more than 12 games. They are playing bowl 
games before the season even starts -- things called the <ORGANIZATION>Kickoff Classic</ORGANIZATION> and 
<ORGANIZATION>Disneyland Pigskin Classic</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
A college distinguished for its football has set up a private television deal 
with <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION>. Lesser arrangements by universities result in as many as 11 games 
being seen on TV on a single <DATE>Saturday</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Why can't the players comport themselves like those who run college football, 
detached from earthly goods, dedicated to the spirit of friendly rivalry that 
sportsmen seek? 
</P>
<P>
New Year's Day, you will see that the number of bowl games on television has 
been limited to eight. 
</P>
<P>
"You will note the restraint," university people will tell players thinking of 
jumping to the pros. "We easily could play 10 on New Year's, scheduling two 
games between <TIME>midnight</TIME> and 6 in the morning." 
</P>
<P>
Originally, college football favored us with four bowls on <DATE>Jan. 1</DATE> -- Rose, 
Orange, Cotton and Sugar. 
</P>
<P>
It expanded to five with something known as the <ORGANIZATION>Sunkist</ORGANIZATION> Fiesta Bowl. Then, 
presumably on a leveraged buyout, the <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> Citrus Bowl took over the 
Tangerine Bowl and soon bumped New Year's Day viewing to six games. 
</P>
<P>
The <PERSON>Hall</PERSON> of Fame Bowl increased it to seven, the figure now escalating to eight 
with a switching of dates of the <ORGANIZATION>Mazda</ORGANIZATION> Gator Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Eight bowl games battling each other on the same day might appear as overkill, 
but what's a little cannibalization among educated people? 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, the Cotton Bowl has come to be called the <ORGANIZATION>Mobil Cotton Bowl</ORGANIZATION> and the 
Sugar Bowl the <ORGANIZATION>USF&amp;G</ORGANIZATION> Sugar Bowl. The Sun Bowl became the <PERSON>John Hancock</PERSON> Sun 
Bowl, until such time as the sponsor decided such billing was a deterrent to 
direct communication. 
</P>
<P>
The name was changed to <PERSON>John Hancock</PERSON> Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
And the universities, observing events, go along, because they are not as 
commercially oriented as today's players. 
</P>
<P>
Over in <LOCATION>Tucson</LOCATION>, they got a postseason game certified known as the Copper Bowl. 
Linking up with a firm that makes mouth freshener, the game became known as the 
Copper BreathLess Bowl, but that would change to Copper Bowl, presented by 
BreathLess. 
</P>
<P>
Last heard from, the game was still breathing, but without its mouth-freshening 
sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
Mind you, this is watched unblinkingly by the colleges, role models for those 
student-athletes who would dump their schools for a lousy <MONEY>$80,000</MONEY> a year from 
the pros. 
</P>
<P>
Since only one bowl game, the Rose, has fixed participants every year, the 
others must hoof it, entering into bloodlettings to beat out rivals for the 
best teams. 
</P>
<P>
Rules prevent bowls from contacting teams before specified dates, and, of 
course, no school would fudge, accepting bids prematurely, because this would 
set a bum example for the players. 
</P>
<P>
Watching a school that lacks integrity, a player with eligibility might be 
tempted to talk to a pro team in the alley about the draft. 
</P>
<P>
Now, say, you play for Clemson where home sellouts are automatic. Why open with 
<LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> when you can play <LOCATION>Cal State Long Beach</LOCATION>? 
</P>
<P>
Same financial result. 
</P>
<P>
So you wipe out <LOCATION>Long Beach</LOCATION>, 59-0, enhance the winning record and prepare three 
weeks down the line to entertain <ORGANIZATION>Appalachian State</ORGANIZATION>. Picturing <PERSON>George Allen</PERSON>, 
<LOCATION>Long Beach</LOCATION> coach, on the sideline <DATE>last Saturday</DATE>, you heard him mumble: "The 
future is 20 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
But <ORGANIZATION>Clemson</ORGANIZATION> establishes standards any admiring kid will want to emulate as he 
strolls the boulevard of life.

AILING BRUINS GOT WHAT DOCTOR ORDERED; 
</P>
<P>
UCLA: UPSET OF NO. 2 WASHINGTON PROVIDES A MUCH-NEEDED LIFT HEADING INTO 
RENEWAL OF USC RIVALRY. 
</P>

<P>
UCLA's 25-22 upset of second-ranked <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> <DATE>Saturday</DATE> in <LOCATION>Seattle</LOCATION> was 
significant in many respects. 
</P>
<P>
It provided a struggling team with an emotional lift and might have a 
long-range effect on the football program. 
</P>
<P>
It was also one of the most astounding victories in <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION> history considering 
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>'s 21-point favoritism and the Huskies' previous domination of 
Pacific 10 Conference opponents this season. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, by winning, the Bruins (5-5) have an opportunity to avert a second 
consecutive losing season if they beat <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION> <DATE>Saturday</DATE> at the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
There is some irony, however, to <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION>'s status. Even if the Bruins beat the 
Trojans and finish with a 6-5 record, they probably won't be invited to a bowl 
game. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA Athletic Director <PERSON>Peter Dalis</PERSON> said that his phone wasn't ringing 
repeatedly <DATE>Sunday</DATE> with calls from bowl representatives. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't heard a thing since we lost to <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> (<DATE>Sept. 22</DATE>)," <PERSON>Dalis</PERSON> said. 
"The Peach Bowl was the last bowl to pay any attention to us. All the oral 
commitments have been made. 
</P>
<P>
"The only way that you might slip into a bowl is if a bowl had an agreement 
with someone earlier and that team might not have a six-victory season and the 
bowl doesn't have a backup." 
</P>
<P>
A <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> rule prohibits schools with losing records from playing in a bowl game. 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION> is committed to the Peach Bowl <DATE>Dec. 29</DATE> in <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>, reportedly against 
<ORGANIZATION>North Carolina State</ORGANIZATION> or <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION> has a 5-3-1 record with games remaining against <ORGANIZATION>Illinois</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Purdue</ORGANIZATION>. 
Last year, <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION> was apparently set to play in the Freedom Bowl, before 
losing to <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Purdue</ORGANIZATION> and finishing with a 5-6 record. 
</P>
<P>
It is believed that conferences are as eager as some bowl representatives to 
place their teams in bowl games at the earliest possible date. 
</P>
<P>
For example, five Pac-10 teams are already in bowl games: <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, Rose; 
<ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>John Hancock</PERSON>; <LOCATION>Oregon</LOCATION>, Freedom; <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Aloha</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, Copper. 
</P>
<P>
Official invitations will not be presented until <DATE>Nov. 24</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA Coach <PERSON>Terry Donahue</PERSON> wasn't thinking about a bowl game after the Bruins' 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
"It puts us in a position to save our year, bowl, or no bowl, " <PERSON>Donahue</PERSON> said. 
"We have an opportunity for a winning season in our big game with our 
cross-town rival. 
</P>
<P>
"But there's more to it than that. When you beat the No. 2 team in the country 
in their stadium, with the weather conditions (wind and light rain) it helps 
your program, your confidence and the players who have been struggling." 
</P>
<P>
To put <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION>'s accomplishment in perspective, it ranks with a 7-6 victory over 
<ORGANIZATION>Stanford</ORGANIZATION>'s Rose Bowl-bound "Vow Boys" in <DATE>1935</DATE>; the 14-12 victory over <LOCATION>Michigan 
State</LOCATION> in the <DATE>1966</DATE> Rose Bowl; a <DATE>20-17</DATE> victory in <DATE>1972</DATE> over <LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION>, the 
defending national champion, and a 23-10 victory over <ORGANIZATION>Ohio State</ORGANIZATION> in the <DATE>1976</DATE> 
Rose Bowl game after the Bruins lost to the <LOCATION>Buckeyes</LOCATION>, 41-20, during the regular 
season. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA Notes 
</P>
<P>
<DATE>Saturday</DATE>'s game with <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION> will be unusual in that a Rose Bowl invitation will 
not be on the line for either team. That was the situation in <DATE>1986</DATE> and <DATE>1980</DATE> 
(when both teams were on probation). Previously, the Rose Bowl bid was a prize 
for at least one team, or one team had already clinched a Rose Bowl berth, in 
every year since <DATE>1971</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA's defense, which has been maligned at times this season, held <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> 
to 283 total yards, 139 yards below its season average. UCLA defensive 
coordinator <PERSON>Bob Field</PERSON> said the team had four goals:

"We didn't want (tailback) <PERSON>Greg Lewis</PERSON> to rush for 100 yards (he got 50). No. 2 
was not to allow them to break any run for more than 20 yards (they didn't). 
No. 3 was not to let them catch any pass for over 25 yards (which they did) and 
make (quarterback) <PERSON>Mark Brunell</PERSON> beat us with his arm, and not his feet. (He 
completed only 10 of 34 passes). We wanted to make him one dimensional, not 
two. We just played our base defense, simple and sound."

<HEADLINE>  BOWLING THEM OVER ON NEW YEAR'S DAY
COLLEGE GAME IS FEELING THE EFFECTS OF A
FULL SCHEDULE  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  College Football

<TEXT>     It should be pointed out that <PERSON>Neinas</PERSON> considers himself "an above-average
football fan," which qualifies as a huge understatement. <PERSON>Neinas</PERSON>, the executive
director of the <ORGANIZATION>College Football Association</ORGANIZATION>, wants to keep up with all the
action.;    But it's not possible. His eyes don't move quickly enough, and
even the fastest remote control in the West would be woefully lacking.;   
"Eight games," <PERSON>Neinas</PERSON> says. "It's too much. It's not fair to the fans.";   
Especially for those fans with only one television set.;    Just when you
thought they couldn't stuff any more games into that overstuffed bag that is
New Year's Day, the bowls went ahead and did it. Starting at <TIME>8:30 a.m.</TIME> with
the Gator Bowl and ending around <TIME>9 p.m.</TIME> with the Sugar Bowl, there will be
eight games today, a football hater's worst nightmare.;    Eight is enough; 
And it's hardly a dream for the bowls, either. For them, eight is more than
enough. In fact, eight is ridiculous. Furthermore, eight is one of the reasons
some of critics suggest the bowl system could be in trouble in the <DATE>1990s.</DATE>;   
The glut of games on <DATE>Jan. 1</DATE> has the bowls extremely nervous. So do falling TV
ratings and the ever-expanding <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> season, which could squeeze several bowls
out of business. Then there's the threat that proceeds from corporate sponsors
might be subject to taxation, along with flaws in the selection process, which
has many in the college establishment fuming and screaming for a playoff.;   
Indeed, this is not the best of times for the folks who run the bowl kingdom.;
   "We're not dead yet," said the Orange Bowl's <PERSON>Steve Hatchell</PERSON>, the head of
the College Bowl Association.;    But there are signs that the castle walls
are cracking. Nowhere is it more evident than the erosion of television
ratings, a lifeblood for the bowls, on New Year's Day.;    In a former life .
. .;    For years, <DATE>Jan. 1</DATE> was the domain of the Rose, Sugar, Cotton and Orange
bowls, and they enjoyed the spoils. In <DATE>1981</DATE>, the four bowls averaged an
impressive 19.9 ranking. The <DATE>1979</DATE> Rose Bowl had a 29.2 rating.;    However, in
<DATE>1982</DATE>, the Fiesta Bowl moved to <DATE>Jan. 1</DATE>. Last year, there were seven games on
that day.;    The glut's fallout could be inevitable. With ratings down,
rights fees from the networks might be reduced. And with exposure diminished,
corporate sponsors, which pay a significant portion of the bowls' ticket,
might think twice about writing the next check.;    "There's little question
the television marketplace is flattening out in the <DATE>1990s</DATE>," said Big Ten
Commissioner <PERSON>Jim Delany</PERSON>, whose conference has a lucrative tie-in to the Rose
Bowl. "Sure, there's a concern.";    "How far can the television dollar go?"
<PERSON>Hatchell</PERSON> said. "Overexposure in an undistinguished market could be
detrimental.";    The obvious solution would be for the bowls to work together
to find remedies to their problems. But the bowls appear to be their own worst
enemies.;    The urgency to work together, though, might be greater than it's
ever been. Besides the ratings difficulties, the expansion of the <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> regular
season -- which goes to the <DATE>last weekend</DATE> in <DATE>December</DATE> -- significantly reduces
time slots available to the bowls, at least as far as television is
concerned.;    There's also the threat from the <ORGANIZATION>Internal Revenue Service</ORGANIZATION>.
Currently, the majority of the bowls take in large sums of money from
corporate sponsors. Because bowls are considered non-profit organizations,
those funds haven't been taxed. But the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> is doing audits to see whether it
should change its policy.;    <PERSON>Hatchell</PERSON> and former Fiesta Bowl head <PERSON>Bruce
Skinner</PERSON> maintain the situation isn't as bleak as it seems. Revenues have gone
up, and payouts continue to grow every year.;    They maintain the system is
healthy, even if others disagree.;    "It's not in as bad a state as some
people have portrayed it," said the Orange Bowl's <PERSON>Hatchell</PERSON>. "There are a lot
of games with incredible interest. There's a lot of good football being
played.;    "Sure, we need some fine-tuning. That doesn't hurt in any
industry.";    But if the problems continue to mount, the bowls could go from
some fine-tuning to a complete overhaul. Even then, the day might come when
the schedule again calls for only four games on <DATE>Jan. 1.</DATE>;    Otherwise known as
the national quarterfinals.;   BOWL GAMES AT A GLANCE; Bowl/

SCHEMBECHLER TO QUIT AS COACH AFTER ROSE BOWL;

COLLEGE FOOTBALL: THE WINNINGEST ACTIVE BIG-TIME COACH IS EXPECTED TO ANNOUNCE

<P>
<PERSON>Bo Schembechler</PERSON>, big-time college football's winningest active coach, will step 
down for medical reasons after <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> plays USC in the <LOCATION>Rose Bowl</LOCATION>, sources 
said <DATE>today</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Schembechler</PERSON>, 60, will turn the <ORGANIZATION>Wolverines</ORGANIZATION>' program over to assistant <PERSON>Gary 
Moeller</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Schembechler</PERSON> will remain as <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>'s athletic director, a post that was added 
to his title in <DATE>1988</DATE> after <PERSON>Don Canham</PERSON> reached the mandatory retirement age of 
70, said the sources, who requested anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Schembechler</PERSON> was out of his office early today. He was to meet with his players 
in the <TIME>afternoon</TIME>. A news conference was scheduled for <TIME>5 p.m.</TIME> EST. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Schembechler</PERSON> told a university sociology class <DATE>Monday</DATE> that he would never sit 
in the coach's office of the <MONEY>$12.5-million</MONEY> <ORGANIZATION>Center of Champions</ORGANIZATION>. The building, 
to be completed next <DATE>autumn</DATE>, will house the football program. 
</P>
<P>
He also told the students that <PERSON>Moeller</PERSON> would be the next coach. 
</P>
<P>
Heart attacks in <DATE>1970</DATE> and <DATE>1987</DATE> resulted in open-heart surgery, and 
<PERSON>Schembechler</PERSON>'s physicians have urged him to slow down ever since. The decision 
was made easier because the <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> football program is riding the crest of 
two consecutive Big Ten championships. 
</P>
<P>
It also was becoming necessary because Associate Athletic Director <PERSON>Jack 
Weidenbach</PERSON>, who has been in charge of daily operations of the department while 
<PERSON>Schembechler</PERSON> tended to football duties, is nearing retirement age. 
</P>
<P>
Sources close to <PERSON>Schembechler</PERSON> said he decided to make the announcement now 
because he wants prospective recruits to know who the coach will be. 
</P>
<P>
Schembechler leads all coaches in <ORGANIZATION>NCAA Division</ORGANIZATION> I-A with a record of 234-64-8 
after 21 years at <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> and six at <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> of <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>. He is fifth on the 
all-time list and needs only four more victories to match his mentor at <ORGANIZATION>Ohio 
State</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Woody Hayes</PERSON>. Schembechler is the winningest coach in <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> history at 
194-47-5. 
</P>
<P>
Schembechler never has had a losing season. Fifteen of his 21 <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> teams 
have been ranked in the top 10 nationally. The <DATE>1985</DATE> team finished No. 2 after 
beating <LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION> in the <LOCATION>Fiesta Bowl</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The only honor that has eluded <PERSON>Schembechler</PERSON> is the mythical national 
championship. The Wolverines began the <DATE>1989</DATE> season ranked No. 1 but lost their 
opening game to <LOCATION>Notre Dame</LOCATION> before reeling off 10 straight wins. They are ranked 
No. 3 and have only a slim chance of slipping past <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> in the 
final <ORGANIZATION>Associated Press</ORGANIZATION> poll after the bowl games. 
</P>
<P>
"If you think that my career has been a failure because I have never won a 
national title, you have another think coming," <PERSON>Schembechler</PERSON> said a few days 
before beating <ORGANIZATION>Ohio State</ORGANIZATION> in the final regular-season game this season. "I have 
never played a game for the national title. Our goals always have been to win 
the <ORGANIZATION>Big Ten</ORGANIZATION> title and the Rose Bowl. If we do that, then we consider it a 
successful season." 
</P>
<P>
The New Year's Day game against <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION> will be <PERSON>Schembechler</PERSON>'s 10th Rose Bowl and 
third in the <DATE>last four years</DATE>. The Wolverines (10-1) earned their second 
consecutive Big Ten title this season and 13th in <PERSON>Schembechler</PERSON>'s career. 
</P>
<P>
Moeller, 48, has been an assistant to <PERSON>Schembechler</PERSON> for 18 years. He rejoined 
the <ORGANIZATION>Wolverines</ORGANIZATION>' staff in <DATE>1980</DATE> after three years as coach at <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>, where he 
was released after compiling a 6-24-3 record.

THINGS DON'T ALWAYS COME UP ROSES; 
</P>
<P>
ROSE BOWL: A TARDY PARTICIPATING TEAM, TWO PHANTOM TOUCHDOWNS AND WOODY HAYES' 
TANTRUMS HAVE ALL BEEN A PART OF THE NEW YEAR'S DAY GAME.

<P>
A near fist-fight between rival coaches, phantom touchdowns, a coach's 
tantrums. Is this any way to start the New Year? 
</P>
<P>
Things don't always come up roses in the <LOCATION>Rose Bowl</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
There are some thorns among the dramatic moments, upsets and spectacular plays 
that are part of the lore of the <ORGANIZATION>Rose Bowl</ORGANIZATION> game. 
</P>
<P>
For reference, see <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> Coach <PERSON>Bo Schembechler</PERSON>, who will be making his 10th 
appearance in <LOCATION>Pasadena</LOCATION> <DATE>Jan. 1</DATE> against <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION>, with a record of two victories, 
seven losses and one disputed touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
After the first Rose Bowl game in <DATE>1902</DATE> between <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> and Stanford at 
<ORGANIZATION>Tournament Park</ORGANIZATION>, a polo match and then chariot races replaced the game through 
<DATE>1915</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
There is no documentation of chariot disputes, but in the first Rose Bowl game 
played at its present site the grumbling began before the teams even came onto 
the field. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
1923: GET ME TO THE GAME ON TIME 
</P>
<P>
This would be <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION>'s first of 27 appearances in the Rose Bowl and the Trojans 
were the second choice to represent the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, which had won the <ORGANIZATION>Pacific Coast Conference</ORGANIZATION> championship and had 
defeated <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION>, declined the invitation for unspecified reasons. 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> representative, <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION>, had been invited in <DATE>April</DATE> of the 
previous year, but still the <ORGANIZATION>Nittany Lions</ORGANIZATION> couldn't get to the game on time. 
</P>
<P>
USC Coach <PERSON>Elmer</PERSON> (Gloomy Gus) <PERSON>Henderson</PERSON> and his players stewed on the field 
awaiting <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION>'s arrival. The game was scheduled to start at <TIME>2:30 p.m.</TIME>, 
but <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> didn't arrive until 45 minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION>'s coach, <PERSON>Hugo Bezdek</PERSON>, was not a stranger to <LOCATION>Pasadena</LOCATION>, so he couldn't 
have claimed that he was lost. He had the unusual background of having coached 
<LOCATION>Oregon</LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Mare Island Marines</ORGANIZATION> to victories in the <DATE>1917</DATE> and <DATE>1918</DATE> Rose Bowl 
games. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson confronted <PERSON>Bedzek</PERSON>, who was standing alone on the field. 
</P>
<P>
"Where have you been?" Henderson demanded. 
</P>
<P>
"We got caught in a traffic jam," <PERSON>Bezdek</PERSON> replied. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson: "You tried to stall so we would get itchy." 
</P>
<P>
Bezdek: "You're a liar." 
</P>
<P>
Henderson: "You're a lot of bunk." 
</P>
<P>
Bezdek: "Take off your glasses and we'll settle the whole matter right here." 
</P>
<P>
Henderson declined, saying later that he wanted no part of <PERSON>Bezdek</PERSON>, who had 
earned his way through the <ORGANIZATION>University of Chicago</ORGANIZATION> by fighting under an assumed 
name. 
</P>
<P>
If <PERSON>Bezdek</PERSON> had planned to gain a psychological advantage by being late, it 
didn't work as the Trojans won, 14-3. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Bezdek</PERSON> was hardly charitable in defeat, saying: 
</P>
<P>
"The best team lost. The best team and the best coaching in the world wouldn't 
have won against the luck <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION> had today. When at its best, my team could beat 
USC by 40 points. My only regret is that <PERSON>Elmer Henderson</PERSON> had left his glasses 
on." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
1949: RAISING CAIN WITH CAL 
</P>
<P>
Instant replay: Where was it when it was needed the most? 
</P>
<P>
In the category of controversial touchdowns, the <DATE>1949</DATE> Rose Bowl game between 
<ORGANIZATION>Northwestern</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> still has an eminent place. 
</P>
<P>
It was the third game of the series between the <ORGANIZATION>Pacific Coast Conference</ORGANIZATION> and 
the Big Ten (then called the Big Nine). 
</P>
<P>
In the <DATE>second quarter</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Northwestern</ORGANIZATION> fullback Art <PERSON>Murakowski</PERSON> fumbled while 
lunging for a touchdown from the one-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
A picture in The Times showed that <PERSON>Murakowski</PERSON>'s feet were not in the end zone, 
but referee <PERSON>Jimmy Cain</PERSON> nevertheless signaled a touchdown, ruling that 
<PERSON>Murakowski</PERSON> fumbled after his body had crossed the plane of the goal line. 
</P>
<P>
That decision was challenged then, as it still is today, by photographic 
evidence, although camera angles can be deceiving. 
</P>
<P>
Murakowski's touchdown and subsequent missed extra point provided <ORGANIZATION>Northwestern</ORGANIZATION> 
with a 13-7 lead. The Wildcats went on to win, <DATE>20-14</DATE>, getting the winning 
touchdown on <PERSON>Ed Tunnicliff</PERSON>'s 43-yard run late in the <DATE>fourth quarter</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Although <PERSON>Cain</PERSON> made the touchdown signal, the actual decision was the 
responsibility of field judge <PERSON>Jay Berwanger</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
Berwanger, as you may recall, was the first Heisman Trophy winner in <DATE>1935</DATE>, from 
the <ORGANIZATION>University of Chicago</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Northwestern hasn't played in a Rose Bowl game since <DATE>1949</DATE>, and with its 
football program on the downgrade, it may never again. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE WACKY WORLD OF <PERSON>WOODY 
</P>
<P>
Woody Hayes</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Ohio State</ORGANIZATION>'s late coach, made an indelible impression in his many 
trips to the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
The cantankerous <PERSON>Hayes</PERSON> set a standard for boorish behavior in his first 
appearance in the Rose Bowl in <DATE>1955</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
He complained about the bands chewing up an already muddy field and he was less 
than gracious after the Buckeyes beat the Trojans, 20-7. 
</P>
<P>
Excerpts from <LOCATION>Woody</LOCATION>'s bombast: 
</P>
<P>
"The bands should have been required to stay on the sidelines instead of 
putting on the show where we were going to play. I think bands are a fine thing 
but they owe their popularity to football, not the other way around. 
</P>
<P>
"There are about four, possibly five teams in the <ORGANIZATION>Big Ten</ORGANIZATION> that could beat <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION>. 
Big Ten teams are better in the Rose Bowl because they are raised on tougher 
competition." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Hayes</PERSON> was hardly a seer, though, considering that the Pac-10 has beaten the <ORGANIZATION>Big 
Ten</ORGANIZATION> in 18 of the <DATE>last 24</DATE> Rose Bowl games. 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>Ohio State</ORGANIZATION> coach's ugliest display of temper occurred in the <DATE>1973</DATE> Rose Bowl 
game against <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Before the game, he shoved a camera held by <ORGANIZATION>The Times</ORGANIZATION>' Art <PERSON>Rogers</PERSON> into the 
photographer's face. Rogers required medical treatment. 
</P>
<P>
After the game, which the national champion Trojans won, 42-17, <PERSON>Hayes</PERSON> was asked 
about the incident. 
</P>
<P>
He exploded, cursing a reporter and storming out of the interview tent. 
</P>
<P>
A criminal battery suit on behalf of <ORGANIZATION>Rogers</ORGANIZATION> was later dropped when <PERSON>Hayes</PERSON> sent a 
letter of apology. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
1979: WHO NEEDS THE BALL TO SCORE? 
</P>
<P>
Thirty years after <PERSON>Murakowski</PERSON> scored his disputed touchdown in the Rose Bowl, 
<ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Charles White</PERSON> revived the play against <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Only this time television instant replay was available to show that officials 
botched the call. 
</P>
<P>
Here was the situation: 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION> had the ball on the <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> three-yard line in the <DATE>second quarter</DATE> when 
White, the tailback, sky-dived toward the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
He reached it all right, but without the ball, leaving it at the one-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
One official signaled a touchdown, another ruled that <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> had gained 
possession by recovering a fumble. 
</P>
<P>
Referee <PERSON>Paul Kamanski</PERSON> cast the tiebreaking vote, saying that the line judge, 
<PERSON>Gilbert Marchman</PERSON>, was in charge of forward progress of the ball. Since the line 
judge was emphatic that the ball had broken the plane of the goal line, 
<PERSON>Kamanski</PERSON> concluded that White had scored. 
</P>
<P>
Others who watched the instant replay, ardently disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
In any event, <ORGANIZATION>White</ORGANIZATION>'s touchdown gave USC a 14-3 lead, and the Trojans went on 
to win, 17-10. 
</P>
<P>
The victory provided <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION> with a share of the national championship with <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION> 
and left <PERSON>Schembechler</PERSON> with an 0-5 record in the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Bo had an opinion on the play, saying: "From what all our players say, he 
didn't score. I don't want to talk about it. If I do, I'll sure as hell say 
something that will get me into trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"I have some definite thoughts but I don't want to relate them here. It's a 
shame something like that had to distract from the effort of the kids, but the 
fact remains we didn't play well enough to win." 
</P>
<P>
In <DATE>1982</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION> scored the winning touchdown in a <DATE>17-13</DATE> victory over <LOCATION>Notre Dame</LOCATION> in 
a similar fashion, with tailback <PERSON>Michael Harper</PERSON> seemingly losing the ball while 
diving into the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
Said <PERSON>Schembechler</PERSON> at the time: "<ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION> has perfected that play."

SMITH: USC IS VILLAIN AGAINST BO, MICHIGAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAL FLORENCE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Some guys will do anything to win a ballgame." 
</P>
<P>
That was <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION> Coach <PERSON>Larry Smith</PERSON>'s good-natured response to the retirement 
announcement by <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Bo Schembechler</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Smith</PERSON>, an assistant under <PERSON>Schembechler</PERSON> at both <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> of <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> and 
close to him ever since, already has lost one Rose Bowl game to his former 
mentor, a 22-14 setback last <DATE>January</DATE>. Now, <PERSON>Schembechler</PERSON> has a built-in 
emotional advantage in his <LOCATION>Pasadena</LOCATION> rematch with <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
You know, win one for the old coach in his last game. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Smith</PERSON> didn't discount that aspect <DATE>Thursday</DATE> when he said: "I don't think there's 
any question that there will be a lot more media attention for Bo's last game. 
</P>
<P>
"You're talking about one of the great college football coaches in the country. 
There's no doubt in my mind that <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> will be a little extra emotionally 
charged for the game and it provides an incentive and a challenge for us." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Smith</PERSON> said <PERSON>Schembechler</PERSON>'s announcement came as somewhat of a surprise, but he 
liked the way his friend bowed out. 
</P>
<P>
"He made his own decision," <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> said. "Bo did it his way." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Schembechler</PERSON> has not won a national championship in his 27 years as a head 
coach, and even though his team is ranked No. 3 nationally, it doesn't figure 
that <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> could climb to No. 1 even by beating <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
That assessment was made before <PERSON>Schembechler</PERSON> said the Rose Bowl would be his 
final game as a coach. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Smith</PERSON> said that if <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> beats <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION> and No. 1-ranked <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION> loses to <LOCATION>Notre 
Dame</LOCATION>, there is a possibility that coaches and writers would vote <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> No. 1 
as a sentimental gesture to <PERSON>Schembechler</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
Schembechler is 2-7 in the <LOCATION>Rose Bowl</LOCATION>, and <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> is 0-2, having lost in 
successive years to <LOCATION>Michigan State</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if the pressure builds with each defeat, <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> said: "I don't think it's 
the pressure. You keep searching until you find a way. I just try to find a 
better way of doing things, or correcting your mistakes that caused you to 
lose, or whatever it may be. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, it's inevitable. It's like the film of Rocky. You get knocked down enough 
times, you just find a way to win the championship." 
</P>
<P>
Smith, of course, will be primed to deprive <PERSON>Schembechler</PERSON>, who has 234 
victories, of his last win. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of a bittersweet type of thing," <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> said. "This is one time we're 
going to be wearing the black hat no matter what. And he's going to be wearing 
the white hat. We're the villains in this one." 
</P>
<P>
Asked to recall a <PERSON>Schembechler</PERSON> story, <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> didn't hesitate. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the first day I was hired as an assistant coach at <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> along with 
some other guys. We drove to <PERSON>Ann Arbor</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Mich.</LOCATION>, in the middle of <DATE>December</DATE> and 
checked into a hotel. It was snowing, and we were told to be in the office at 7 
o'clock in the <TIME>morning</TIME>. 
</P>
<P>
"Bo never told us how to get there. He just said to be there. So, with the 
weather, we were slipping and sliding with our cars all over the place trying 
to get there. 
</P>
<P>
"We got there five minutes early. And there was Bo, all stretched out and 
relaxed, and he asked, 'Where have you been?' He'd expected us to be there 20 
minutes early." 
</P>
<P>
Trojan Notes 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION> began practice <DATE>Thursday</DATE> on campus but will work out at <ORGANIZATION>UC Irvine Dec</ORGANIZATION>. 
27-30. . . . Outside linebacker <PERSON>Junior Seau</PERSON>, who suffered a mild right shoulder 
separation against <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION>, is ready to practice, but his contact work may be 
limited. . . . The Trojans are well-represented on <ORGANIZATION>The Sporting News 
All-America</ORGANIZATION> first team, with Seau and defensive back <ORGANIZATION>Mark Carrier</ORGANIZATION>. UCLA punter 
<PERSON>Kirk Maggio</PERSON> also is on the team. . . . Wide receiver <PERSON>John Jackson</PERSON> has been 
named an <ORGANIZATION>NCAA Today</ORGANIZATION>'s Top 6 award winner for scholastic achievement. Jackson 
carries a 3.30 grade-point average while working on a graduate degree in 
business . . . Coach <PERSON>Larry Smith</PERSON> said offensive tackle <PERSON>Pat Harlow</PERSON> has a back 
problem and is questionable for the Rose Bowl game. If he can't play, he'll be 
replaced by 6-foot-7, 290-pound <PERSON>Michael Moody</PERSON>. <PERSON>Smith</PERSON>'s analysis of the 
Wolverines: "They don't beat themselves." . . . <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION> strong safety <ORGANIZATION>Mark Carrier</ORGANIZATION> 
is a finalist for the <PERSON>Jim Thorpe</PERSON> Award, given to the nation's best defensive 
back. . . . Omen? Smith is only the second coach in history to get to the <ORGANIZATION>Rose 
Bowl</ORGANIZATION> in his first three seasons at a school. Stanford's Tiny <PERSON>Thornhill</PERSON> 
(1933-35) was the other. Like <PERSON>Smith</PERSON>, he lost his first two Rose Bowl games but 
won the third.

<P>
IT HAS BEEN QUITE A REIGN FOR DUKE; 
</P>
<P>
BIG TEN COMMISSIONER WILL RETIRE WHEN A REPLACEMENT IS CHOSEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
One of <PERSON>Wayne Duke</PERSON>'s most prized possessions is the clipping from Sports 
Illustrated that pictures him with <PERSON>John Wayne</PERSON> at the Rose parade. <PERSON>John Wayne</PERSON> 
sent him the clipping and signed it, "To <PERSON>Wayne Duke</PERSON> from Duke Wayne." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Wayne Duke</PERSON>, commissioner of the <ORGANIZATION>Big Ten</ORGANIZATION>, smiles when he tells about that 
now-fading momento. 
</P>
<P>
So you see, <ORGANIZATION>Duke</ORGANIZATION> does have some fond memories of the annual trip he has made to 
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION> for the Rose Bowl every year for the past 18 years. But ask him 
about the highlights and lowlights of his New Year's Day ritual and he gives 
that familiar <PERSON>Wayne Duke</PERSON> grimace. 
</P>
<P>
He had been in town less than 3 hours <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> and he had already been asked 
why the <ORGANIZATION>Big Ten</ORGANIZATION> can't win the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Since announcing his retirement last <DATE>summer</DATE>, a retirement that will become 
effective in the upcoming year when a successor is chosen, <ORGANIZATION>Duke</ORGANIZATION> has had plenty 
of opportunities to review his tenure as leader of the <ORGANIZATION>Big Ten</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The conference boasts the largest football and basketball attendance in the 
country, and that comes from winning a lot of games. 
</P>
<P>
Duke was chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> basketball tournament committee that expanded the 
field to 64 teams and upped the TV rights so that the tournament now brings in 
about <MONEY>$55 million</MONEY>. 
</P>
<P>
Duke was on the committee that put together a <MONEY>$103 million</MONEY> TV package between 
the <ORGANIZATION>Big Ten</ORGANIZATION> and the Rose Bowl that will run through <DATE>1997</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
The Rose Bowl game is truly dear to his heart. Duke has always been able to 
refer to the game as "the granddaddy of them all" without cracking a smile at 
the corny sound. He believes it. 
</P>
<P>
It's a traditional matchup, and <ORGANIZATION>Duke</ORGANIZATION> believes that college football should be 
more traditional, should match schools and school spirits for the pride and the 
memories and the glory, not an abstract No. 1 and No. 2 for a mythical title. 
</P>
<P>
"You can have a 'national championship' game in <LOCATION>Phoenix</LOCATION> this year, or, from 
time to time, in <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>, but this game will be sold out year after year after 
year," <ORGANIZATION>Duke</ORGANIZATION> said. 
</P>
<P>
The <PERSON>Rose Bowl</PERSON> is his kind of college football. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Walter Byers</PERSON>, the longtime executive director of the <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION>, now retired, who 
strongly influenced Duke during his early years in the <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> office, told the 
<LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> Tribune: "We both came from the romantic era in sports. Emphasis was 
placed on values to be learned from the game. You competed because you enjoyed 
it." 
</P>
<P>
While he can get quite philosophical about the over-emphasis on winning and 
losing, even at the level of eighth-grade soccer his grandson plays, Duke 
cannot deny the impact it has on him to have to see his teams lose. 
</P>
<P>
"I go in the dressing rooms," <PERSON>Duke</PERSON> said. "I try to go to our team's dressing 
room after any game I see in the conference. I always go down after the Rose 
Bowl game. And there's a disappointment in there after a loss. People who are 
critical of our bowl record, or even people who are critical of the team's 
performance that day, don't have to see, first hand, the terrible 
disappointment that is felt by the players and the coaches who have put so much 
into the game. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy up in the stands who has been tailgating all day and who thinks he has 
all the answers, doesn't have to see what losing does to the players and the 
coaches." 
</P>
<P>
Or what it does to <ORGANIZATION>Duke</ORGANIZATION>, who has come back up to the pressbox looking so 
distressed that writers have joked about keeping an eye on him so he doesn't 
jump from the roof. 
</P>
<P>
Duke tries to keep smiling. "<PERSON>Tom Hansen</PERSON> (commissioner of the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> 10) tells 
me I'm a very good loser," <PERSON>Duke</PERSON> said. "I tell him, that's because I've had a 
lot of practice." 
</P>
<P>
But it doesn't get easier. 
</P>
<P>
As he flipped through the pages of his memories, <ORGANIZATION>Duke</ORGANIZATION> could not seem to 
separate good times and bad times in <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION> from the wins and the 
losses. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll tell you the contrast," <PERSON>Duke</PERSON> said. "The first year we were here and 
something that happened just last year make a good contrast." 
</P>
<P>
The first year Duke and his wife, <PERSON>Martha</PERSON>, came out for the Rose Bowl game, 
<ORGANIZATION>Stanford</ORGANIZATION> beat <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>. It was after the <DATE>1971</DATE> season. 
</P>
<P>
For the Duke family, it was an emotional time, anyway. He had become Big Ten 
commissioner on <DATE>Sept. 1, 1971</DATE>, after 8 years as commissioner of the <ORGANIZATION>Big Eight</ORGANIZATION> 
and 11 years of service in the <ORGANIZATION>National Collegiate Athletic Assn.</ORGANIZATION> office. They 
had just sold their home of 19 years to make the move to <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
After all those years of going to <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> every holiday season for the Orange 
Bowl, they were in <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION> -- where it was raining. 
</P>
<P>
The <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> team was having to practice in <LOCATION>Bakersfield</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing was looking too rosy. 
</P>
<P>
And then, the all-important game. In the final minutes of the game, <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> 
got a safety to go ahead of <LOCATION>Stanford</LOCATION>, 12-10. But <PERSON>Don Bunce</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>Stanford</ORGANIZATION> 
quarterback, took <ORGANIZATION>Stanford</ORGANIZATION> down the field and <PERSON>Rod Garcia</PERSON> kicked a field goal to 
beat the <LOCATION>Wolverines</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"Martha and I had been talking about how the final standings would go if 
<LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> lost, and we knew that Big Eight teams were going to be 1-2-3," <PERSON>Duke</PERSON> 
said. "We'd been talking about that for days. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, <PERSON>Lawrence Welk</PERSON> was grand marshal of the parade that year, and he was at 
the <ORGANIZATION>Tournament House</ORGANIZATION> that night for the party. He stood up there and said, 'A-1 
and a-2 and a-3,' and <PERSON>Martha</PERSON> burst into tears." 
</P>
<P>
Not a happy memory. 
</P>
<P>
The <PERSON>Dukes</PERSON> decided in subsequent years to skip the party at the <ORGANIZATION>Tournament 
House</ORGANIZATION>. It was a celebration. Often the <ORGANIZATION>Big Ten</ORGANIZATION> contingent didn't feel like 
celebrating. The <PERSON>Dukes</PERSON> would go back to the presidential suite at the <LOCATION>Pasadena 
Hilton</LOCATION> to spend the evening with <ORGANIZATION>Big Ten</ORGANIZATION> guests. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, when <ORGANIZATION>Michigan State</ORGANIZATION> beat <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION>, they again skipped the <ORGANIZATION>Tournament 
House</ORGANIZATION> celebration. It wouldn't look right to show up only after a victory. 
</P>
<P>
So the <PERSON>Dukes</PERSON> were back in their suite that evening, savoring a victory that, 
admittedly, was a "blue collar win . . . a game we won after <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION> fumbled, but 
we'd lost a lot of games that way" when there was a knock at the door. 
</P>
<P>
"All the Rose Bowl officers -- <PERSON>Harriman Cronk</PERSON> and all the rest -- came to bring 
me my Rose Bowl watch," <PERSON>Duke</PERSON> said. "That was a highlight. They left their 
celebration to bring that to me, and I appreciated that." 
</P>
<P>
There were some points in their long relationship when some of the Rose Bowl 
folks were not too happy with <ORGANIZATION>Duke</ORGANIZATION>, when he sided with the movement to exclude 
the exclusivity clause from the Rose Bowl contract. 
</P>
<P>
Some feared that allowing Big Ten and Pac-10 teams to compete in other bowls, 
also, would dilute the impact of the Rose Bowl. Duke believed that the Rose 
Bowl, matching the champions of the conferences, would remain as strong as ever 
while letting more teams compete would be of benefit to both conferences. 
</P>
<P>
He was right, as usual. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last few years, Big Ten and Pac-10 schools have claimed an average of 
<PERCENT>40%</PERCENT> of the total bowl pot of about <MONEY>$50 million</MONEY>. 
</P>
<P>
Duke points out that opening opportunities was good for parity in his 
conference, good for attendance, good for recruiting. 
</P>
<P>
"When I had just been named commissioner of the Big Eight, and I was only 34 
years old at the time, one of the first things I faced was the news that the 
Orange Bowl was terminating our exclusive contract," <PERSON>Duke</PERSON> said. "They wanted to 
be able to invite the top teams, to have a 'national championship' game. 
</P>
<P>
"Sports Illustrated wrote that the loss of that contract would be the death 
knoll of the <ORGANIZATION>Big Eight</ORGANIZATION>. Actually, it turned out to be a boon to the <ORGANIZATION>Big Eight</ORGANIZATION>. 
It opened up vistas for other bowls. We went to the Cotton Bowl, the Sugar Bowl 
and the Orange Bowl. It was great for our conference." 
</P>
<P>
Since the Rose Bowl changed its policy, and the <ORGANIZATION>Big Ten</ORGANIZATION> started to compete in 
other bowls in <DATE>1976</DATE>, Big Ten schools have taken 56 bowl berths. 
</P>
<P>
Duke and his wife have been at a bowl game on New Year's Day for the <DATE>last 26 
years</DATE>. They might attend a bowl game just for fun next year. Or they might not. 
</P>
<P>
If he's not at the Rose Bowl next year, he says he'll miss it. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been to most of the bowl games at one time or another," <PERSON>Duke</PERSON> said. "I've 
been to all the major bowls -- Orange, Cotton, Sugar. . . . And this is not to 
degrade any of the others. But I think the Rose Bowl is special."

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Rating the five best New Year's Day bowl games: 
</P>
<P>
1. Orange Bowl. <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION> can clinch the national championship, and should, 
against a <ORGANIZATION>Notre Dame</ORGANIZATION> team that usually stinks out the joint in <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>. The Irish 
will be in big trouble against the quicker Buffaloes if Rocket Ismail is slowed 
by a shoulder injury. . . . 2. Rose Bowl. <PERSON>Bo Schembechler</PERSON>'s retirement makes 
this special. The Wolverines used to lose in <LOCATION>Pasadena</LOCATION> because they couldn't 
pass. Now they are well-balanced (2,380 yards running, 1,818 passing). But the 
key is the young <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION> quarterback, <PERSON>Todd Marinovich</PERSON>, who must regain his form 
after an off day against <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION>. . . . 
</P>
<P>
3. Fiesta Bowl. <ORGANIZATION>Florida State</ORGANIZATION> is playing better than anyone in the nation after 
losing its first two games. Coming off a rare win over <LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION> will 
keep it close, high-scoring and entertaining. . . . 
</P>
<P>
4. Sugar Bowl. Kickoff will be about a half-hour after the Orange Bowl starts, 
and by the <DATE>fourth quarter</DATE>, <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> could be shooting for a national title. An 
upset might silence <PERSON>Bill Curry</PERSON>'s critics at <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION> -- at least for a month or 
two. . . . 
</P>
<P>
5. Cotton Bowl. In <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Tennessee</LOCATION> they care very much about this 
neighborhood brawl, but it will draw a yawn from the rest of the country. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The best musical show will be in <LOCATION>Pasadena</LOCATION>, where the always powerful <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> 
band is matched against colorful USC. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Trojan wide receiver <PERSON>John Jackson</PERSON> has completed the grand slam of athletic and 
academic honors. A 3.30 <ORGANIZATION>GPA</ORGANIZATION> graduate in business who is working on his master's 
degree, <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON> has won an <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> postgraduate scholarship, been named to the 
<ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> Top Six and been selected as a <ORGANIZATION>National Football Foundation</ORGANIZATION> 
scholar-athlete, <PERSON>Woody Hayes</PERSON> scholar-athlete and first-team <ORGANIZATION>GTE</ORGANIZATION> academic 
All-American. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The rising star at <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Joel Meyers</PERSON>, will announce the Freedom Bowl on TV 
<DATE>Saturday</DATE> and the Rose Bowl on radio <DATE>Monday</DATE>. . . . 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> running back <PERSON>Emmitt Smith</PERSON> will be the center of attention in the 
Freedom, but <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> center <PERSON>Bern Brostek</PERSON> is projected to be a first-round 
draft choice. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The AFC and NFC wild-card games each would receive more attention if they were 
played on different days, but TV ratings are better on <DATE>Sunday</DATE> than on <DATE>Saturday</DATE>. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
By now, we've gotten used to playoffs without the <ORGANIZATION>Raiders</ORGANIZATION>, Dolphins and 
Cowboys. But no Bears, either? . . . 
</P>
<P>
If you're looking for a couple of sleepers to make it to the Super Bowl, try 
the <ORGANIZATION>Rams</ORGANIZATION> and Browns. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Three of the top four offensive teams in the <ORGANIZATION>AFC</ORGANIZATION> didn't get into the playoffs 
-- and neither did three of the top five defensive teams. . . . 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Tom Lasorda</PERSON> says the first time he met <PERSON>Billy Martin</PERSON> was on the diamond. But the 
sport was boxing. "I was pitching for <LOCATION>Kansas City</LOCATION> against the Yankees in <DATE>1956</DATE>," 
the Dodger manager recalled. "I threw at him. A fight broke out. It wasn't long 
after, though, that we became friends. You just had to be in the same room with 
the guy for an hour to love him." . . . 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Lasorda</PERSON> on <ORGANIZATION>Martin</ORGANIZATION>, the manager: "He knew how to motivate people. That made him 
a winner." . . . 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of his numbers, <PERSON>Brett Hull</PERSON> isn't half the hockey player his father 
<PERSON>Bobby</PERSON> was. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The change in the style of play in the <ORGANIZATION>NHL</ORGANIZATION> is reflected in the statistics of 
<PERSON>Doug Harvey</PERSON>, the <PERSON>Hall</PERSON> of Fame defenseman who died <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> at 65. The most goals 
he scored in a single season was nine. . . . 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Robb Stauber</PERSON>, the goaltender out of the <ORGANIZATION>University of Minnesota</ORGANIZATION> who made <PERSON>Mark 
Fitzpatrick</PERSON> expendable, still hasn't played for the <ORGANIZATION>Kings</ORGANIZATION>' New Haven farm club 
because of groin and back injuries. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Look-alikes: <PERSON>Jerry Burns</PERSON> and <PERSON>Burgess Meredith</PERSON>. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The more thoroughbred racing there is, the less predictable it gets. . . . 
</P>
<P>
What a pleasure it is to hear <PERSON>Trevor Denman</PERSON> call the races at <LOCATION>Santa Anita</LOCATION> 
again. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Their last 0.2-second defeat to the Celtics was just another step in the 
learning process for the young Clippers. What they learned is that it helps to 
be part of the <ORGANIZATION>NBA Establishment</ORGANIZATION> when crucial calls are made by officials. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
Who else but <ORGANIZATION>Larry Bird</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Magic Johnson</PERSON> did you expect to decide the outcomes 
of two games in the same city the same night with free throws? . . . 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> take note: The Clipper-Celtic game was long by <ORGANIZATION>NBA</ORGANIZATION> standards. It lasted 2 
hours 15 minutes. . . . 
</P>
<P>
It's easy to rap the <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> hierarchy for not keeping up with the Lakers, but 
this would be a much different club if not for the Len Bias tragedy and the 
defection of <PERSON>Brian Shaw</PERSON> to <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>. . . . 
</P>
<P>
No team with <PERSON>Akeem Olajuwon</PERSON> in the lineup should have a losing record. . . . 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> will be the sentimental favorite on the moon <DATE>Monday</DATE>. Three Apollo 15 
crew members who are graduates of the university left a UM flag there.

USC, UCLA IN VULNERABLE SPOTS; 
</P>
<P>
PAC-10 POWERS OF '80S LOSE STAR QUARTERBACKS TO NFL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
USC and <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION> have been the teams of the '80s in the Pacific-10 Conference. But 
as the decade draws to a close, the competition is gaining ground. 
</P>
<P>
USC has split four Rose Bowl games this decade, while <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION> is 3-0. The only 
other Pac-10 teams to play in <LOCATION>Pasadena</LOCATION> during that time are <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> and 
<ORGANIZATION>Arizona State</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION> won its first 10 games before losing its regular-season finale 
to <LOCATION>Notre Dame</LOCATION> and falling to <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> in the Rose Bowl. UCLA also finished 10-2 
and won an NCAA-record seventh straight bowl game, beating <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION> 17-3 in the 
Cotton Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
But both Pac-10 powers could be vulnerable this season because their star 
quarterbacks have gone to the <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Troy Aikman</PERSON> signed a rich contract 
with the <ORGANIZATION>Dallas Cowboys</ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Rodney Peete</PERSON> was drafted by the <ORGANIZATION>Detroit 
Lions</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the loss of the multi-talented <PERSON>Peete</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION> Coach <PERSON>Larry Smith</PERSON> does not 
plan to change his offense much this season. With talented tailback <PERSON>Aaron 
Emanuel</PERSON> and fullback <PERSON>LeRoy Holt</PERSON>, the Trojans once again stress the running 
game. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a chance to have our best running game since I came here," <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> said. 
"We have our top five rushers from last year back." 
</P>
<P>
The starting quarterback figures to be either <PERSON>Pat O'Hara</PERSON>, a fourth-year junior 
who completed five of seven passes last season, or redshirt freshman <PERSON>Todd 
Marinovich</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
O'Hara came out of spring practice as the first-stringer. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel good about our quarterback position," <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> said. "I'm really not that 
worried about it right now. My main concern is not the quarterbacks, but to 
make sure we get the whole team playing team football." 
</P>
<P>
With <PERSON>Aikman</PERSON> gone, <ORGANIZATION>Jimmy Bonds</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Bret Johnson</PERSON> are battling for the starting 
quarterback job at <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"We have always needed two quarterbacks and have always used two quarterbacks," 
Bruins Coach <PERSON>Terry Donahue</PERSON> said. "I think both of them are good players and 
both are capable of playing." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson is a redshirt freshman while Bonds is a third-year sophomore who 
completed four of seven passes for 42 yards in limited duty last season. 
</P>
<P>
"I think what we'll do differently, particularly early, is try to be a better 
running team and not put as much pressure on the quarterback to do things that 
Troy did," <PERSON>Donahue</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
Tailbacks <PERSON>Brian Brown</PERSON>, <PERSON>Shawn Wills</PERSON> and <PERSON>Kevin Williams</PERSON> will run behind an 
experienced offensive line. Wills ran for 622 yards as a freshman last season, 
while <PERSON>Brown</PERSON> gained 410 yards. <ORGANIZATION>Williams</ORGANIZATION>, one of the most highly recruited prep 
players a year ago, wound up redshirting because of hamstring problems. 
</P>
<P>
Like <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Washington State</ORGANIZATION> must adjust to the loss of its star 
quarterback. <PERSON>Timm Rosenbach</PERSON>, who led the nation in passing and guided the 
Cougars to a 9-3 record last season, skipped his senior year to enter the <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Washington State</ORGANIZATION> also has a new coach, <ORGANIZATION>Mike Price</ORGANIZATION> from <ORGANIZATION>Weber State</ORGANIZATION>. Price 
replaces <PERSON>Dennis Erickson</PERSON>, who went to <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> after <PERSON>Jimmy Johnson</PERSON> left to become 
the head coach of the <LOCATION>Dallas Cowboys</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Oregon could challenge if junior quarterback <PERSON>Bill Musgrave</PERSON> remains healthy. The 
Ducks started 6-1 <DATE>last year</DATE>, but <PERSON>Musgrave</PERSON> suffered a broken collarbone and they 
lost their last five. 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> finished 6-5 last season and missed a bowl game for the first time 
in 10 seasons. Senior quarterback <PERSON>Cary Conklin</PERSON> returns for Coach <PERSON>Don James</PERSON>, 
who's entering his 15th season coaching at <LOCATION>Seattle</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Other returning Pac-10 quarterbacks include <PERSON>Troy Taylor</PERSON> at <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Jason 
Palumbis</PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION>Stanford</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Paul Justin</PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION>Arizona State</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Ronald Veal</ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>.

BOWL RECORD PROVIDES INCENTIVE FOR UCLA

<TEXT>
<P>
Unable to beat <ORGANIZATION>Washington State</ORGANIZATION> to maintain its No. 1 ranking, or to beat <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION> 
to earn a trip to the Rose Bowl, <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION> can still make <DATE>1988</DATE> a noteworthy season 
by beating <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION> today in the Cotton Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Outscoring the eighth-ranked Razorbacks, who were 10-0 before losing their 
regular-season finale to <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>, would give the Bruins bowl victories in seven 
consecutive seasons, a <ORGANIZATION>National Collegiate Athletic Assn.</ORGANIZATION> record. 
</P>
<P>
Coach <PERSON>Terry Donahue</PERSON> has dangled the record as incentive for his ninth-ranked 
Bruins, who were No. 1 for 2 weeks in <DATE>October</DATE> before staggering through the 
final month of the season, losing 2 of 4 games to finish 9-2. 
</P>
<P>
"In my eyes now, the fact that the national championship slipped away, the fact 
that we aren't the conference champion, the season is nowhere near as 
successful as I had hoped it would be, based on my expectations as they built 
throughout the season," <PERSON>Donahue</PERSON> said. "The emotions of the moment tell me that 
we've got to win this game or the season's a failure." 
</P>
<P>
And beating <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Donahue</PERSON> said, will not be easy, in spite of the opinions 
of the oddsmakers, who favor <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got a lot of obstacles to overcome," he said. 
</P>
<P>
According to <PERSON>Donahue</PERSON>, the Razorbacks have several psychological advantages. 
Donahue seems to say that about every opponent, of course, but in this case he 
seems to harbor legitimate concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Among them: 
</P>
<P>
 -- <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION> has worked toward this day since <DATE>1976</DATE>, when it beat <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION> in its 
last Cotton Bowl appearance, whereas <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION> accepted a bid as the first team from 
the <LOCATION>West Coast</LOCATION> to appear in the Cotton Bowl since <DATE>1949</DATE> only as a consolation 
prize after losing a Rose Bowl showdown to <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION>, 31-22. 
</P>
<P>
 -- <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION> might be inspired by a natural resentment toward <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION>'s 
All-American quarterback, <PERSON>Troy Aikman</PERSON>, who has received most of the attention 
from fans and the local media because the <LOCATION>Dallas Cowboys</LOCATION> are expected to make 
him the No. 1 pick next <DATE>April</DATE> in the <ORGANIZATION>National Football League</ORGANIZATION> draft. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A majority of the fans in the sold-out, 72,032-seat Cotton Bowl stadium 
will wear funny red hats shaped like hogs' heads. Whereas about 35,000 tickets 
to the game were sold in <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION>, fewer than 3,000 were sold at <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
 -- <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION> might simply be better than advertised. The Razorbacks, some 
believe, were underrated, never rising above eighth in the national rankings. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Southwest Conference</ORGANIZATION> champions, in fact, earned more respect from their 
loss to <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> than they did from their 10 victories. And they might have beaten 
the second-ranked Hurricanes if safety <PERSON>Steve Atwater</PERSON> hadn't dropped a potential 
interception in the <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION> end zone with fewer than 6 minutes to play. 
<LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Carlos Huerta</PERSON> then kicked a 20-yard field goal with 5:38 left to give 
the Hurricanes an 18-16 victory. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a great opportunity here," <PERSON>Donahue</PERSON> said. "I think the obstacles and 
the barriers for this game are a great deal different and more challenging than 
some we've had in past (bowl) games." 
</P>
<P>
UCLA, though, isn't the only one facing hurdles. 
</P>
<P>
Even before <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION> arrived in <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> <DATE>last week</DATE>, Coach <PERSON>Ken Hatfield</PERSON> had 
suspended, for unspecified reasons, <ORGANIZATION>All-Southwest Conference</ORGANIZATION> offensive guard 
<PERSON>Freddie Childress</PERSON> and defensive tackle <PERSON>Wayne Martin</PERSON>, an All-American and the 
defensive player of the year in the <ORGANIZATION>Southwest Conference</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Neither will play today. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the <ORGANIZATION>Razorbacks</ORGANIZATION> have had to deal with speculation about <PERSON>Hatfield</PERSON>, who 
reportedly is among the candidates to replace <PERSON>Vince Dooley</PERSON> at <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"After the game, we'll decide about the future," said <PERSON>Hatfield</PERSON>, who has 
sidestepped all questions about his plans. 
</P>
<P>
And the <LOCATION>Razorbacks</LOCATION>, despite their record, were hardly a dominant team, winning 
6 games by 8 points or less, including a 21-14 victory over 0-11 Rice. 
</P>
<P>
"We were just about one step better than everybody we played and then we got to 
<LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> and were about one step behind," <PERSON>Hatfield</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
Directed by quarterback <PERSON>Quinn Grovey</PERSON>, who led the <ORGANIZATION>Southwest Conference</ORGANIZATION> in 
passing efficiency but passed for only 966 yards and 4 touchdowns, the 
<ORGANIZATION>Razorbacks</ORGANIZATION>' flexbone attack ranked third in the SWC in total offense. 
</P>
<P>
The Razorbacks also ranked third in total defense. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA, meanwhile, caught the nation's attention with its 41-28 dismantling of 
<LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION> in <DATE>September</DATE>, moved to No. 1 after <ORGANIZATION>Notre Dame</ORGANIZATION> knocked off <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> in 
<DATE>October</DATE> and rolled to a 7-0 start, its best in 22 years, before squandering a 
27-6 <DATE>third-quarter</DATE> lead in a 34-30 loss to <LOCATION>Washington State</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
That was followed by less-than-impressive victories over <LOCATION>Oregon</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Stanford</ORGANIZATION>, 
in which <PERSON>Aikman</PERSON> endured his least productive games, and the loss to <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION>, in 
which <PERSON>Aikman</PERSON> was brilliant, throwing for 317 yards and 2 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Still, <PERSON>Hatfield</PERSON> said that <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION> was more balanced offensively than <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> and 
called the Bruins "as good a team as there is in the country." 
</P>
<P>
Unless they beat <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION>, though, their season will be looked upon in some 
circles as a disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
"If you can view 9-2 as an unsuccessful season, I'm not sure that I'm not as 
guilty as the next person in contributing to the madness," <PERSON>Donahue</PERSON> said. "It 
was a good year, but it just didn't meet all of our expectations." 
</P>
<P>
A victory over the Razorbacks would ease the burden. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cotton Bowl Notes 
</P>
<P>
Of the 4 other schools that won bowl games in 6 consecutive seasons, <ORGANIZATION>Georgia 
Tech</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION> had their streaks ended by <ORGANIZATION>Southwest Conference</ORGANIZATION> schools. 
<ORGANIZATION>Georgia Tech</ORGANIZATION> lost to <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION>, 14-7, in the <DATE>1960</DATE> Gator Bowl and <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION> lost to 
<LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, 14-12, in the <DATE>1982</DATE> Cotton Bowl. USC and <LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION> also won bowl games in 
6 straight seasons. . . . In the only meeting between the schools, <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION> and 
<LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION> played to a 10-10 tie in the <DATE>1978</DATE> Fiesta Bowl. . . . <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION> is listed as 
a 5 1/2-point favorite. . . . The extended forecast called for a cloudy sky 
with temperatures in the low 50s and a <PERCENT>20%</PERCENT> chance of rain. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA is playing in a bowl game for the eighth consecutive season, the longest 
current string in the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> 10 Conference. Its record in bowl games is 8-7-1, 
including a 6-2-1 record under Coach <PERSON>Terry Donahue</PERSON>. . . . <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION> is 9-12-3 in 
bowl games, including a 1-3 record under Coach <PERSON>Ken Hatfield</PERSON> and a 2-3-1 record 
in the Cotton Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Outside linebacker <PERSON>Eric Smith</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION> will miss the game with knee and ankle 
injuries, <PERSON>Donahue</PERSON> said <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, and will be replaced in the starting lineup by 
<PERSON>Billy Ray</PERSON>. . . . <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION> also will be without inside linebacker <PERSON>Chance Johnson</PERSON>, 
who is out with a knee injury, reserve linebacker <PERSON>Stacy Argo</PERSON> and reserve 
defensive back <PERSON>Randy Beverly</PERSON>. . . . <PERSON>Eric Ball</PERSON>, who has been bothered by an 
ankle injury, will start at tailback and reserve wide receiver <PERSON>David Keating</PERSON> 
might play despite a hamstring injury, <PERSON>Donahue</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
Mark <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> will take the place of suspended right guard <ORGANIZATION>Freddie Childress</ORGANIZATION> in 
<LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION>' starting lineup, although <PERSON>James Morris</PERSON> will move over from left guard 
to take <PERSON>Childress</PERSON>' regular place in the line. . . . Suspended defensive tackle 
<PERSON>Wayne Martin</PERSON>, who led the Razorbacks with 13 sacks, will be replaced by 
sophomore <PERSON>Tony Ollison</PERSON>. . . . <PERSON>James Rouse</PERSON>, who was <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION>' leading rusher 
before missing the <ORGANIZATION>Razorbacks</ORGANIZATION>' last 5 games with a knee injury, is expected to 
play, but will not start.

Colorado could simplify the voting process in the final <ORGANIZATION>Associated Press</ORGANIZATION> and 
<ORGANIZATION>United Press International</ORGANIZATION> college football polls by beating <ORGANIZATION>Notre Dame</ORGANIZATION> <DATE>Monday</DATE> 
<TIME>night</TIME> in the <LOCATION>Orange Bowl</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The Buffaloes, the current No. 1-ranked team, would remain unbeaten, and who 
really cares which teams finish second through fourth in the balloting. 
</P>
<P>
All remaining contenders -- <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Notre Dame</LOCATION> -- would have at 
least one loss. 
</P>
<P>
However, if <ORGANIZATION>Notre Dame</ORGANIZATION> beats <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> beats <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION> in the Sugar Bowl 
and <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> beats USC in the <LOCATION>Rose Bowl</LOCATION>, the voting could become more 
subjective. 
</P>
<P>
In that event, it would seem logical to elevate <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>, now ranked No. 2, to the 
top spot, considering that it already had beaten <LOCATION>Notre Dame</LOCATION>, which had disposed 
of the current No. 1 team, <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
However, <ORGANIZATION>Notre Dame</ORGANIZATION>, now No. 4, which has a strong national following, may get 
some support from reporters (<ORGANIZATION>Associated Press</ORGANIZATION>) and coaches (<ORGANIZATION>United Press 
International</ORGANIZATION>) for the No. 1 ranking. 
</P>
<P>
There also could be voting backlash against <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> for reasons that have nothing 
to do with results. The Hurricanes, with their swaggering and finger-pointing 
on the field and previous "convict" image, may be a distasteful choice for the 
electorate. 
</P>
<P>
Voters might be looking for any excuse not to promote <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> to No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
An indication of <ORGANIZATION>Notre Dame</ORGANIZATION>'s popularity was evident in a recent USA Today 
phone-in poll. Answering the question of who is the nation's No. 1 team, 1,063 
voted for <ORGANIZATION>Notre Dame</ORGANIZATION>, 611 for <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>, 498 for <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> and only 443 for 
<LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> Coach <PERSON>Bo Schembechler</PERSON> says it's "a shot in the dark" for his team to 
get the No. 1 ranking. 
</P>
<P>
However, considering that <PERSON>Schembechler</PERSON> is retiring after the Rose Bowl game and 
that he has never won a national championship in his 21 years as the 
Wolverines' coach despite an impressive record, he and his <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> team could 
be a sentimental choice to jump from No. 3 to No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
That seems unlikely, though, because <ORGANIZATION>Notre Dame</ORGANIZATION> beat <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> in a 
season-opening game. 
</P>
<P>
In tiebreakers for conference championships, head-to-head results are the 
determining factor. 
</P>
<P>
That is not necessarily a guideline for the voting in the wire service polls. 
</P>
<P>
Take <DATE>1978</DATE>, for example. USC beat <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION>, 24-14, in the third game of the 
season and then later lost to <ORGANIZATION>Arizona State</ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION> didn't lose another game, 
and neither did <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Since <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION> beat <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION>, there was an obvious tiebreaker in the voting for No. 
1. However, the <ORGANIZATION>AP</ORGANIZATION> poll selected <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION> as national champion. The <ORGANIZATION>UPI</ORGANIZATION> poll 
tabbed USC as No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
There's also the possibility that there could be split national champions again 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
Since <DATE>1974</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>UPI</ORGANIZATION> poll has not recognized teams that are on <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> probation. 
The <ORGANIZATION>AP</ORGANIZATION> poll doesn't make such a distinction. 
</P>
<P>
In <DATE>1974</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION> was designated national champion by <ORGANIZATION>UPI</ORGANIZATION> at the end of the season. 
<LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION>, which was on probation, was AP's national champion. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, it isn't a perfect system but one that could be settled by playoffs 
such as in college basketball. Although a playoff system has been discussed, 
and some coaches favor it, nothing has been resolved. 
</P>
<P>
The major bowls are opposed to a playoff formula, figuring that it might damage 
their prestige if, say, the Rose Bowl or the Orange Bowl were designated as 
semifinal <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> playoff games, rather than the championship game. 
</P>
<P>
One final thought: What if there are some tie games in the strategic bowl 
games? That's another problem for the electorate. 
</P>
<P>
Gamesmanship in the <LOCATION>Orange Bowl</LOCATION> began <DATE>Dec. 22</DATE> when <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION> Coach <PERSON>Bill 
McCartney</PERSON> brought his team to <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>. Notre Dame Coach <PERSON>Lou Holtz</PERSON>, whose team 
didn't arrive until <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>, has said that preparation is difficult at a 
bowl site because of bowl-related activities and distractions. 
</P>
<P>
"All you try to do is control damage," <PERSON>Holtz</PERSON> said. "You don't even know if the 
ball is blown up or stuffed." 
</P>
<P>
McCartney interpreted <PERSON>Holtz</PERSON>'s comments as second-guessing. 
</P>
<P>
"Coach <PERSON>Holtz</PERSON> questions our strategy in coming down here early and spending time 
with the beautiful people of <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>," <PERSON>McCartney</PERSON> said. "I don't understand that. 
(Former Oklahoma coach) <PERSON>Barry Switzer</PERSON> said he always came down early and felt 
like it was the ideal way to prepare his squad. 
</P>
<P>
"I think <PERSON>Switzer</PERSON> is the guy I want to listen to." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>McCartney</PERSON> said the Buffaloes came to <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> early because cold weather and snow 
in <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION> made it difficult for them to practice at home. 
</P>
<P>
The players seem to be enjoying the change in climate. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a chance for us to come down here and get used to the weather," wide 
receiver <PERSON>Jeff Campbell</PERSON> said. "We're coming from a place where there isn't any 
oxygen to a place where there's a lot of oxygen. So we have to get used to 
stuff like that." 
</P>
<P>
Said quarterback <PERSON>Darian Hagan</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> native: "This is good weather to 
practice in. We're living it up right now." 
</P>
<P>
Said <PERSON>McCartney</PERSON>: "I'm not in any way concerned about being down here too long." 
</P>
<P>
Your move, <PERSON>Lou</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: What is the name of the only bowl game ever played in <LOCATION>Havana</LOCATION>, and 
which teams participated? (Answer below.) 
</P>
<P>
<DATE>Monday</DATE>'s Rose Bowl game will be played on the <DATE>50th anniversary of the 1940</DATE> game 
between <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Tennessee</LOCATION>. The game was unique in that it marked the second 
consecutive year that <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION> defeated Rose Bowl opponents who came into the game 
unbeaten, untied and unscored upon. 
</P>
<P>
USC beat <ORGANIZATION>Duke</ORGANIZATION>, 7-3, in the <DATE>1939</DATE> game on <ORGANIZATION>Doyle Nave</ORGANIZATION>'s last-minute touchdown pass 
to <PERSON>Al Krueger</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
The Trojans then spoiled <LOCATION>Tennessee</LOCATION>'s perfect record, 14-0, behind the running 
and passing of tailback <PERSON>Ambrose Schindler</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
USC's victory prompted <ORGANIZATION>Henry McLemore of United Press</ORGANIZATION> to write: 
</P>
<P>
"They raise them rugged out here. Perhaps nature sees that they do in order 
that they will be able to withstand earthquakes, unusual weather and the water 
that comes out of the taps. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a lesson to be learned from the Rose Bowl game. There is no sense in 
betting on a team that buys its clothes in the boys' department to beat a team 
that has to shave twice a day and is fitted for suits in the adult or grown-up 
section." 
</P>
<P>
It was the last Rose Bowl game for <ORGANIZATION>USC Coach Howard Jones</ORGANIZATION>. He died in <DATE>1941</DATE>, 
leaving a legacy of five Rose bowl victories without a defeat. 
</P>
<P>
If <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> wins the national championship, <PERSON>Dennis Erickson</PERSON> will become the first 
coach in 41 years to get the title in his first year at a school. <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>'s 
<PERSON>Bennie Oosterbaan</PERSON> was the last coach to do it, in <DATE>1948</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: The <ORGANIZATION>Bacardi</ORGANIZATION> Bowl on <DATE>Jan. 1, 1937</DATE>, when <PERSON>Auburn</PERSON> and Villanova 
played to a 7-7 tie.

MIKE DOWNEY: SUDDENLY, THE MAN IS AN EXPERT

<TEXT>
<P>
They all laughed last year when I picked <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION> to defeat <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION>. "At what?" they 
asked. "Synchronized swimming?" One guy in my office who attended <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION> wondered 
aloud how I could write such a thing and expect to be taken seriously. Hey, 
babe, I don't like to be taken seriously. I just like to be taken. 
</P>
<P>
Anyhow, they would have laughed just as hard last year had I picked <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION> to 
defeat <LOCATION>Cal State Fullerton</LOCATION> . . . or <LOCATION>Cal</LOCATION> Tech . . . or <PERSON>Kal Daniels</PERSON>. Not only did 
<ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION>'s <DATE>1989</DATE> team not belong in the <LOCATION>Rose Bowl</LOCATION>, it couldn't have been elected 
best float in the Rose parade. The queen's dress had better material than <PERSON>Terry 
Donahue</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, that didn't stop me. Bravely, I went with <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION>. On <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION>'s field, yet. I 
demonstrated my courage. I danced with wolves. I dared the men of Troy to spit 
in my eye. But after the game, they couldn't. Their chins were too low. 
</P>
<P>
USC lost to <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION>, 10-10. 
</P>
<P>
I know, I know; that's a tie. But I know and you know -- and you know that 
everybody else knows -- that the Trojans got their helmets handed to them. They 
had excellent football players -- even beat <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> in the Rose Bowl -- but 
they couldn't beat <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION>. The Bruins tied them up, tied them down. 
</P>
<P>
It was the definite highlight of a <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION> season in which the players protected 
<PERSON>Donahue</PERSON>'s consecutive streak of victories in bowl games by not playing in one. 
This is a major accomplishment, by the way, in an American era in which bowl 
games outnumber Taco Bells and 7-Elevens, two to one. 
</P>
<P>
For <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION>, last year's game was a terrible disappointment, mostly because from 
<DATE>November</DATE> to <DATE>January</DATE>, all the student body had to look forward to was . . . 
yuck, basketball. 
</P>
<P>
And now, 12 months later, they're back! . . . Trojans and Bruins! . . . you 
know 'em, you love 'em! . . . well, you know 'em! . . . to clash in college 
football's greatest rivalry! . . . unless, of course, you attended <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>, 
<ORGANIZATION>Ohio State</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Harvard</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Yale</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Stanford</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Cal</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> A&amp;M, 
Wabash or <ORGANIZATION>DePauw!</ORGANIZATION> . . . <DATE>Saturday</DATE> in <LOCATION>Pasadena</LOCATION>, <TIME>12:30 p.m.</TIME>, be there! . . . (or 
be somewhere else). 
</P>
<P>
And I know what you're asking: 
</P>
<P>
"<PERSON>Mike</PERSON>, who's gonna win?" 
</P>
<P>
Well, first off, let me tell you right up front that I haven't the slightest 
idea where you get the nerve to think you know me well enough to call me by my 
first name. And next off, look: I have no personal stake in this game. I did 
not attend <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION>. I did not go to <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION>. The college I attended barely had indoor 
toilets, much less football. We didn't even have cheerleaders. 
</P>
<P>
Read my lips: I don't care which team wins. 
</P>
<P>
But what the heck, I'll take a shot. It's the least I can do. (The most I can 
do being early retirement.) My boss is pretty worried that I'll insult 
somebody. My boss is one of those guys who believes in being overly respectful 
and polite and mealy-mouthed about every college football team in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>. My 
boss went to <LOCATION>Notre Dame</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Here's my USC-UCLA scouting report: 
</P>
<P>
TOMMY vs. TODD: <PERSON>Tommy</PERSON> (Auto) <PERSON>Maddox</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION> quarterback, has had a better 
season than Todd (Classes? I Don't Need No Stinking Classes) <PERSON>Marinovich</PERSON>, and I 
predict that if <PERSON>Marinovich</PERSON> should decide to turn pro by the end of the season, 
<PERSON>Maddox</PERSON> should decide to turn pro by the end of <DATE>Saturday's third quarter</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Tommy the gun has been one fresh freshman. Only two things kept <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION> from 
having a miserable season, and one of them was <PERSON>Maddox</PERSON>. The other one was 
<ORGANIZATION>Stanford</ORGANIZATION>, which prides itself on keeping just about everybody from having a 
miserable season. 
</P>
<P>
As for <ORGANIZATION>Todd</ORGANIZATION>, should he even start? <PERSON>Larry Smith</PERSON> takes out <PERSON>Shane Foley</PERSON> after 
touchdown drives. Does <PERSON>Foley</PERSON> use too many plays when he leads USC to 
touchdowns? Does he drink too much Gatorade on the sideline? Does he wipe his 
dirty hands on the coach's shirt? What? Come back, <PERSON>Shane</PERSON>, come back! 
</P>
<P>
COACH RED vs. COACH BLUE: I call them that because <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> is always mad and 
<PERSON>Donahue</PERSON> is always sad. 
</P>
<P>
At least, it seems that way. Larry dislikes agents rubbing elbows with his 
players and <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> scouts attending practice and referees suspending games because 
of thunderstorms. Terry thinks everybody in the media is negative unless the 
next day's headline reads: UCLA LOSES AGAIN, BUT TRIES REALLY, REALLY HARD. 
</P>
<P>
This game means a possible Liberty Bowl trip for <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION>, putting <PERSON>Donahue</PERSON>'s bowl 
streak on the line. The Liberty Bowl is in <LOCATION>Memphis</LOCATION>. If <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION> wins <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, the 
most valuable player should face the TV cameras and say: "I'm going to 
Graceland!" 
</P>
<P>
BATTLE OF THE BANDS: Advantage, <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION> team does not have a chance in 
hell to win this game, and might forfeit it, if the Trojan band plays that 
school song over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over 
and over and over, as is its custom. <PERSON>Saddam Hussein</PERSON> would surrender if 
subjected to similar treatment. 
</P>
<P>
THE REAL ROSE BOWL: This is it. Lord knows you don't want to watch that thing 
coming up New Year's Day. What is it, <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> against <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>? Boy, I can 
hardly wait. That game won't even interest people from <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> or <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>. That 
game will have TV ratings like "Cop Rock." 
</P>
<P>
In <DATE>Saturday</DATE>'s big Troy-Donahue battle, I'll go with the Trojans by a couple of 
points. But I could be wrong. Could be three.

ROSE BOWL: MICHIGAN RUNNING BACK LEROY HOARD HAS FOUND A METHOD TO THE MADNESS 
AS A SUBJECT OF COACH BO SCHEMBECHLER'S TIRADES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAL FLORENCE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This will be the last week that <PERSON>Bo Schembechler</PERSON> ever yells at <ORGANIZATION>Leroy Hoard</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Schembechler, as we know, is retiring as <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>'s coach after the Rose Bowl 
game against <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Monday</DATE>. Hoard, a junior, stays on -- a player molded and 
scolded by <PERSON>Schembechler</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
Bo's yelling, which he has done a lot in his 27 years as a head coach, hasn't 
always been music to <ORGANIZATION>Hoard</ORGANIZATION>'s ears, but he has learned to accept it. 
</P>
<P>
Hoard, a 220-pound fullback-tailback, was the most valuable player in last 
<DATE>January</DATE>'s Rose Bowl, a 22-14 Wolverine victory over <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
He broke open the game in the <DATE>fourth quarter</DATE> with a 61-yard run that positioned 
<LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> for its clinching touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Hoard gained 142 yards, averaging 7.5 a carry, and scored two touchdowns in 
that game, shredding a defense that had not allowed another running back to 
gain more than 100 yards during the season. 
</P>
<P>
With <PERSON>Tony Boles</PERSON> inactive because of knee surgery, <ORGANIZATION>Hoard</ORGANIZATION> will play tailback 
exclusively against <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION> instead of alternating at fullback and tailback. Hoard 
rushed for 724 yards, averaging almost five yards a carry, and six touchdowns 
during the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
He is a power back with speed and was so impressive in the last Rose Bowl game 
that Ram Coach <PERSON>John Robinson</PERSON> told <PERSON>Schembechler</PERSON>, a close friend, that <ORGANIZATION>Hoard</ORGANIZATION> had 
the status of a No.1 draft choice. 
</P>
<P>
Hoard is a humble athlete who wasn't even sure he could play college football, 
let alone in the <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
He is also a friendly, outgoing sort who gets into <PERSON>Bo</PERSON>'s doghouse occasionally 
by cutting a class. 
</P>
<P>
"Leroy hasn't given me any trouble; I've given <PERSON>Leroy</PERSON> trouble," <PERSON>Schembechler</PERSON> 
said. "He and I have had some disagreements, and I'm the head coach." 
</P>
<P>
That's vintage Bo. 
</P>
<P>
Schembechler made it clear, though, that <ORGANIZATION>Hoard</ORGANIZATION> has never done anything 
seriously wrong at <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Hoard was a high school star in <LOCATION>New Orleans</LOCATION>, and he recalled what friends and 
other coaches told him about the <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> coach while he was being recruited. 
</P>
<P>
"They said he's a mean guy, the toughest coach there is," <PERSON>Hoard</PERSON> said. "But he 
had a sweet voice. Then, when I got to <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>, I was one of the first guys he 
yelled at, and it has been going on for four years." 
</P>
<P>
Hoard doesn't seem bothered by <PERSON>Bo</PERSON>'s bombast. He seemingly takes it all in 
stride. 
</P>
<P>
There was a time, though, when <PERSON>Schembechler</PERSON>'s tirades upset him. 
</P>
<P>
"The freshmen used to scrimmage on <DATE>Monday</DATE>, and with <PERSON>Jarrod Bunch</PERSON> hurt, I was 
the only fullback," <PERSON>Hoard</PERSON> said. "Well, I fumbled, and the coach said, 'I'll be 
glad when Bunch gets back.' 
</P>
<P>
"When you're a freshman, things coaches say tend to get to you a lot more, 
because when you're older you realize they say things only to motivate you and 
you shouldn't take it personally." 
</P>
<P>
He says he understands Bo now. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the kind of person that if he confronts you, he lets you defend yourself 
-- for a couple of seconds. 
</P>
<P>
"You can get a couple of words in, and I've been known to sneak in more than my 
share. But when I think about it now, it's no use. Just be quiet." 
</P>
<P>
There was a time last year, though, when <PERSON>Schembechler</PERSON> listened, according to 
<ORGANIZATION>Hoard</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"He told me why he did everything," <PERSON>Hoard</PERSON> said. "I said, 'You can yell at me 
all you want,' because I knew he had a reason. For a long time I thought it was 
just me. Maybe I wasn't a good player." 
</P>
<P>
Hoard learned later that <PERSON>Schembechler</PERSON> is indiscriminate in his yelling, even 
though the running back's ears burned more than most. 
</P>
<P>
In an earlier interview with the <ORGANIZATION>Detroit Free Press</ORGANIZATION>, Hoard was philosophical 
about his relationship with <PERSON>Schembechler</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
"Bo taught me that when you do something wrong, you have to accept the 
consequences," he said. "Regardless of how great a game it is, school and the 
other things are more important." 
</P>
<P>
Hoard can joke about his years with <PERSON>Schembechler</PERSON> now that the coach is 
retiring. 
</P>
<P>
"My mom came up for the <ORGANIZATION>Ohio State</ORGANIZATION> game and asked me why I had so many keys," 
<PERSON>Hoard</PERSON> said. "I said, 'This one is for my car and this one is for my apartment. 
This is for the mailbox and this is for Bo's doghouse.' Now I guess I'll have 
to give the key back." 
</P>
<P>
Even though Hoard was a renowned player at <ORGANIZATION>St. Augustine High School</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New 
Orleans</LOCATION>, he doubted his own ability and had his own priorities. 
</P>
<P>
"I left <LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION> because I wanted to get away from home, even if I didn't play 
a lick of football in college, and I didn't think I would play," he said. "I 
wanted to travel, I wanted to see snow, I wanted to go to the Rose Bowl. There 
were a lot of things I wanted to do. 
</P>
<P>
"Out of all the schools I looked at, this was the only school that gave me 
academics, travel and a chance to go to <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>. I chose <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> and I have 
no regrets." 
</P>
<P>
He learned that <PERSON>Schembechler</PERSON> is not effusive in his praise of players. 
</P>
<P>
For example, after his outstanding performance in the Rose Bowl, <PERSON>Schembechler</PERSON> 
told him that he played a good game but made some mistakes that would be 
evaluated at a film session. 
</P>
<P>
Schembechler has been rather mellow on his last trip to the <LOCATION>Rose Bowl</LOCATION> and has 
praised Hoard -- to an extent. 
</P>
<P>
"He's hard to tackle and is a fine, fine runner," <PERSON>Schembechler</PERSON> said. "He gets a 
big play every game, too. But he has to play better without the ball, as a 
blocker, receiver and faker." 
</P>
<P>
Hoard agrees with that assessment. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not that I'm standing around, but there are some points where I can 
improve to make myself a better player," he said. 
</P>
<P>
If he improves as expected, then <ORGANIZATION>Hoard</ORGANIZATION> will probably be an <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> first-round 
draft choice after his senior season. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a longshot," <PERSON>Hoard</PERSON> said of an <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> career. "I didn't think I could play 
college football, but I made it this far. If my career were to end right now, 
I'd be satisfied."

<PERSON>Sullivan Anthony Welborne III</PERSON>, better known as <PERSON>Tripp</PERSON>, for triple, is one of the 
nation's premier defensive backs. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, the <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> strong safety insists that basketball is his first love. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the ever-smiling, personable <PERSON>Welborne</PERSON> likes to tell the story about 
being recruited by <PERSON>Bo Schembechler</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
The <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> coach watched <PERSON>Welborne</PERSON> play for his high school basketball team in 
<LOCATION>Greensboro</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.C.</LOCATION> 
</P>
<P>
"My heart belongs to <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>, but basketball is my favorite sport. I used to 
shoot a lot. No shot is a bad shot. If you're off, you got to shoot until 
you're on. If you're on, you got to keep shooting because you're on," <PERSON>Welborne</PERSON> 
reasoned. 
</P>
<P>
After a non-stop shooting spree, <PERSON>Welborne</PERSON> recalled that <PERSON>Schembechler</PERSON> told him 
he'd have to ice his elbow. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'I always shoot like that.' He said, 'You shot it every time.' " 
</P>
<P>
Now, <PERSON>Welborne</PERSON>, a junior All-American, is shooting down quarterbacks as 
<LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>'s designated blitzer. 
</P>
<P>
In this year's <DATE>22-14</DATE> Rose Bowl victory over USC he made 10 tackles, intercepted 
a pass and forced a fumble. 
</P>
<P>
He was also prominent in his team's come-from-behind, 24-23 win over <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION> 
earlier this season with a 63-yard punt return. 
</P>
<P>
That was the turning-point game for <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Welborne</PERSON> said, after a 
season-opening loss to <LOCATION>Notre Dame</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"We showed our character, showed we could come back, and I think <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION> played 
the best game it played all year," <PERSON>Welborne</PERSON> said. "We didn't play our best 
game, but to come out with a win showed that we hung together. We never thought 
we were going to lose. It showed we can come back from adversity. The lesson 
is, never quit." 
</P>
<P>
The Rose Bowl game will showcase two of the nation's best defensive backs -- 
<PERSON>Welborne</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Mark Carrier</PERSON>, a finalist for the <PERSON>Jim Thorpe</PERSON> award. 
</P>
<P>
Welborne and Carrier were roommates in a hotel during the taping of the Bob 
Hope television show, featuring <DATE>1989</DATE> All-American players. 
</P>
<P>
"We talked about everything," <PERSON>Welborne</PERSON> said. "We talked about the practices we 
had. Our practices are so similar. He told us what they did, and I said, 
'That's the same thing we do.' So it's going to be a battle of the titans, 
everything is equal. The team with the fewest mistakes will win." 
</P>
<P>
As for Carrier, <PERSON>Welborne</PERSON> said: "I've seen him on film, and he's a great, great 
player who makes big plays when you need them." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Welborne</PERSON> has also been impressed by <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION> quarterback <PERSON>Todd Marinovich</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not that he can't play the game because he's young. He can throw the ball 
and do the things necessary to win. He has proved it during the season. 
</P>
<P>
"So we have to go out and play as if he's a veteran, and in our minds, he is. 
He is one of the toughest quarterbacks I've seen outside of our own (<PERSON>Michael 
Taylor</PERSON>). He throws passes and gets hit in the chest, and he'll get right back 
up. That's the mark of a true competitor." 
</P>
<P>
"But, hopefully, he'll make some mistakes in the game and give us a break." 
</P>
<P>
The ongoing theme of the 76th Rose Bowl game is <PERSON>Schembechler</PERSON>'s retirement. He 
said he's enjoying his last week of coaching and will be more cognizant of his 
health when he retires 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Schembechler</PERSON> had a heart attack before the <DATE>1970</DATE> Rose Bowl game with <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION> and has 
had two bypass operations. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not into my new life yet," he said. "But as soon as this is over I'm going 
to the treadmill, watch what I eat and lose weight. I figure this is my last 
fling." 
</P>
<P>
Schembechler has been accommodating and seemingly relaxed during news 
conferences at his team's hotel in <LOCATION>Newport Beach</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
He didn't even get irritated when someone suggested that there would be a hole 
in his career if he doesn't win a national championship. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a hole in my career, as far as I'm concerned," he said. "It may be 
for other people. There's nothing I would have done any differently in my 
coaching career. I won some games, won some (Big Ten) championships, made a lot 
of friends, what the hell else do you want?" 
</P>
<P>
Schembechler also discounts the emotional factor of his team trying to win one 
final game for their coach. "We don't need that. We're playing in the <LOCATION>Rose 
Bowl</LOCATION>. We don't need any added incentive." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Fritz Crisler</PERSON> was the last <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> lame-duck coach to bring a team to the Rose 
Bowl. The Wolverines responded, beating USC, 49-0, in <DATE>1948</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
USC Coach <PERSON>Larry Smith</PERSON> is in favor of sudden-death overtime in college football 
games as a tiebreaking procedure. 
</P>
<P>
He doesn't believe that teams should battle for 60 minutes just to end up in a 
tie. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps that season-ending 10-10 tie with <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION> is still frustrating. 
</P>
<P>
Rose <ORGANIZATION>Bowl Notes 
</P>
<P>
USC</ORGANIZATION> defensive tackle <PERSON>Dan Owens</PERSON> has started every game in his four years at the 
school, and the Rose Bowl will be his 48th in a row. . . . <PERSON>Marinovich</PERSON>, who was 
named freshman of the year by <ORGANIZATION>UPI</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Sporting News</ORGANIZATION>, is already seventh on 
<ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION>'s career passing list.

BOWL REPRESENTATIVES FLOCK TO USC

Even if <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION> lost twice in its last six games, it probably would be invited to a 
New Year's Day bowl game, <PERSON>Jim Brock</PERSON>, executive director of the Cotton Bowl, 
said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
"USC's always been on our wish list," <PERSON>Brock</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
"With three losses, I don't think they'd be out of our hunt. USC is definitely 
on our elite list. They're in the upper echelon. I'd be surprised if <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION> wasn't 
on everybody's list." 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of eight bowl games -- the Cotton, <LOCATION>Citrus</LOCATION>, Holiday, Freedom, 
Sugar, Copper, <LOCATION>Peach</LOCATION> and <PERSON>John Hancock</PERSON> -- will be at the <LOCATION>USC-Arizona</LOCATION> game 
<DATE>Saturday</DATE> at the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
"They've got a marquee player in the quarterback (<PERSON>Todd Marinovich</PERSON>)," <PERSON>Brock</PERSON> said 
of the Trojans. "They've got other players who are going to be future stars in 
the <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION>. They've got tradition, a great record since (Coach) <PERSON>Larry Smith</PERSON> has 
been there. They're appealing. I could see a potential USC-Texas or USC-Texas 
A&amp;M matchup (in the Cotton Bowl) as being a really marquee football game. 
</P>
<P>
"USC's always going to be in the elite bowl-invitation group. Any New Year's 
Day bowl would love to have them." 
</P>
<P>
According to research by the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> 10 Conference and the <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION> had 38 
players on opening-day <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> rosters this season, more than any other school.

FREEDOM BOWL'S STARR CALLS NEW SCOUTING RULE UNWORKABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON MARKUS, The Baltimore Sun 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Press boxes at college football games across the country will be minus a few 
orange and turquoise and Chartreuse sports jackets for at least another month. 
The jackets belong to postseason bowl scouts, who earlier this year agreed to 
stay away from games until <DATE>Oct. 14</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Many welcomed the move. Others went along with it a bit more grudgingly; for 
instance, <PERSON>Tom Starr</PERSON>, executive director of the <DATE>Dec. 30</DATE> Freedom Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, it's not a workable rule," <PERSON>Starr</PERSON> said this week from the game's 
headquarters in <LOCATION>Anaheim</LOCATION>. "There are too many loopholes in it. It was done more 
for the New Year's Day bowls than the non-New Year's Day games." 
</P>
<P>
Among the loopholes <PERSON>Starr</PERSON> is alluding to is that bowls with conference 
affiliations can send scouts to see games at conference sites, such as when 
<ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> visits <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> on <DATE>Sept. 30</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Or that bowls can visit the schools which participated in last year's game, 
giving the Fiesta Bowl clearance to play host to a party at <LOCATION>Notre Dame</LOCATION> <DATE>this 
weekend</DATE>. Or that any bowl can send scouts and have them sit in the stands. 
</P>
<P>
The decision was made at the <ORGANIZATION>College Bowl Assn.</ORGANIZATION> meeting in <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> <DATE>last 
April</DATE>, presumably to cut down on the speculation that begins every <DATE>September</DATE> 
and goes on until the invitations are sent out in <DATE>mid-November</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
It was also done to cut costs. 
</P>
<P>
"But it's not very cost-efficient for us," <PERSON>Starr</PERSON> said. "Take this <DATE>weekend</DATE>, for 
example. Normally, I could go to see <ORGANIZATION>Ohio State</ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> at <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION>. 
That's not to say we're going to get any of those teams. 
</P>
<P>
"But now, if <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Ohio State</ORGANIZATION> drop out of the picture for some other 
games, we're going to have to scout them somewhere down the road." 
</P>
<P>
To the major bowls, the new rule will have little effect. 
</P>
<P>
"The word 'scouting' has been a misnomer," said <PERSON>Bruce Skinner</PERSON>, the Fiesta 
Bowl's executive director. "We're really on a sales mission. The only reason 
you went out in <DATE>September</DATE> is because the other guy was going out." 
</P>
<P>
"If this hadn't been done, you would have seen eight to 10 scouts at the 
<ORGANIZATION>Michigan-Notre Dame</ORGANIZATION> game last week," Cotton Bowl executive director <PERSON>Jim Brock</PERSON> 
said <DATE>earlier this week</DATE> from <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION>. "But in the long run, it doesn't change 
anything." 
</P>
<P>
Certainly not for the major postseason games such as the Rose Bowl, which is 
committed to taking the Big 10 and Pac-10 champions. Or the <ORGANIZATION>Cotton</ORGANIZATION>, which takes 
the <ORGANIZATION>Southwest Conference</ORGANIZATION> winner and a highly ranked opponent. Or the Orange 
(Big Eight vs. independent) and Sugar (<ORGANIZATION>Southeastern</ORGANIZATION> vs. independent). 
</P>
<P>
But for the have-nots, it could turn into a big-time problem. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to have to scramble," <PERSON>Starr</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
Starr was reported to be scrambling <DATE>last weekend</DATE>. He was spotted at, and later 
quoted about, the <ORGANIZATION>Oregon State-Washington State</ORGANIZATION> game. Oops. 
</P>
<P>
Going into the <ORGANIZATION>Ohio State</ORGANIZATION> game at the Coliseum <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION> Coach <PERSON>Larry Smith</PERSON> 
has an 0-4 record against Big 10 teams. 
</P>
<P>
This after Trojan coaches had combined to win 17 straight against the 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
One team that needn't worry about the bowl picture is SMU, which came back from 
the so-called "death penalty" to win its first game since <DATE>Nov. 15, 1986</DATE>. The 
Mustangs beat <LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION> <DATE>last Saturday</DATE> in <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION>, 31-30. 
</P>
<P>
"People have been saying all year that 'You can't . . . you can't . . . you 
can't, but we did," SMU Coach <PERSON>Forrest Gregg</PERSON> said after his team of mostly 
first-year players overcame a 30-14 deficit going into the <DATE>fourth quarter</DATE> to 
beat the <ORGANIZATION>Division I-AA Huskies</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The victory must have been even more gratifying for the one player who stayed 
around while the program was shut down. Fifth-year receiver <PERSON>Mitchell Glieber</PERSON>, 
the son of the late <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION> sportscaster <PERSON>Frank Glieber</PERSON>, caught eight passes for 117 
yards, including a 43-yard touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Michael Bowen</PERSON>, who transferred to <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION> and later returned, caught the 
game-winner, a four-yard pass with no time left. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Texas A&amp;M</ORGANIZATION> tailback <PERSON>Darren Lewis</PERSON> was a dark horse candidate for the Heisman 
Trophy this year, having been the nation's second-leading rusher last year 
(1,692 yards) behind Heisman winner <PERSON>Barry Sanders</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Oklahoma State</LOCATION>. But <PERSON>Lewis</PERSON> 
hasn't made it out of the gate, with only 150 yards in the <ORGANIZATION>Aggies</ORGANIZATION>' first three 
games. 
</P>
<P>
This week's game between unbeaten <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION> (1-0) and undefeated <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION> 
(3-0) marks the first time since the series was renewed in <DATE>1981</DATE> that both 
schools are unbeaten going into the game. 
</P>
<P>
Though second-ranked <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> has suddenly become the hottest football ticket in 
town, selling more season's tickets (52,000) than the Dolphins for the first 
time, Hurricanes fans can still be a tough sell. Junior quarterback <PERSON>Craig 
Erickson</PERSON> heard some boos during last week's 31-3 victory over the <LOCATION>California 
Bears</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Erickson</PERSON> threw four interceptions and three touchdown passes against the 
Bears. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't hear them, and I hope that's not true," first-year <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> Coach <PERSON>Dennis 
Erickson</PERSON> (no relation) said when asked about the boos. 
</P>
<P>
After throwing for 281 yards in his debut against <LOCATION>Wisconsin</LOCATION> two weeks ago, 
<PERSON>Erickson</PERSON> was being touted as having a more successful first outing than any of 
his four famous predecessors. But consider this: <PERSON>Jim Kelly</PERSON> had 280 yards 
against <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION>, while <PERSON>Bernie Kosar</PERSON> (223), <PERSON>Vinny Testaverde</PERSON> (278) and <PERSON>Steve 
Walsh</PERSON> (234) all opened up against <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"It (<PERSON>Erickson</PERSON>'s yardage stat) looks good on TV," one Hurricane cynic said. 
</P>
<P>
At least one member of the <LOCATION>Cal</LOCATION> coaching staff wasn't impressed with the 
Hurricanes. "There are five teams in the Pac-10 better than <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>," linebacker 
coach <PERSON>Denny Creehan</PERSON> said. "Print that." 
</P>
<P>
The Bears didn't make any fans with a pizza shop near campus. After ordering 42 
large pies from a chain called "Fatboys" on <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>night before</TIME> the team left 
for <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>, the shop's manager received a call after the pies had been made. The 
message: "Hold the pepperoni, and everything else". 
</P>
<P>
Did you see the feeble onside-kick attempt by <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> with 4:08 remaining in 
<DATE>last Saturday</DATE>'s 24-19 loss to <LOCATION>Notre Dame</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Ann Arbor</LOCATION>? It went three yards, hit 
a <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> player in the back of the leg, and the ball was awarded to the 
Fighting Irish. 
</P>
<P>
Many second-guessed the move, not the least of whom was <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> Coach <PERSON>Bo 
Schembechler</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Schembechler</PERSON> justified his decision to try it so early by saying that the 
Fighting Irish hadn't been passing (only two the entire game) and once they got 
possession "they'd . . . kill too much time." Also, the <LOCATION>Wolverines</LOCATION> only had one 
timeout left. But after what happened if I had to do it all over again, I 
promise I'd kick it deep." 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of second-guessing some moves on that play, how about <ORGANIZATION>Notre Dame Coach 
Lou Holtz</ORGANIZATION> using starting quarterback <PERSON>Tony Rice</PERSON> on the front line of the return 
team. Holtz kiddingly calls that front line his "Allstate" team, because "we're 
in good hands." 
</P>
<P>
But don't you think the nation's top college football program can find anyone 
else with good hands besides Rice? 
</P>
<P>
Quote of the Week: From <ORGANIZATION>Iowa Coach Hayden Fry</ORGANIZATION> after the Hawkeyes lost at home 
to <LOCATION>Oregon</LOCATION>, 44-6: "I can imagine every other team on our schedule licking their 
chops after this score. We've done a number on a lot of foes over the years, 
and this will be payback time for them."

HE WAS A TOWER OF POWER ON USC'S WINNING DRIVE; 
</P>
<P>
MVP: RICKY ERVINS, WHO CARRIED THE FOOTBALL 30 TIMES FOR 126 YARDS, SAYS THE 
TROJANS WORE DOWN THE WOLVERINES. 
</P>

<P>
When <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION> needed a big play on the ground, they ran a simple off-tackle blast 
with tailback <PERSON>Ricky Ervins</PERSON> carrying the ball behind the blocking of fullback 
<PERSON>Leroy Holt</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
In the <ORGANIZATION>Trojans</ORGANIZATION>' playbook, the play is called "86," which calls for quarterback 
<PERSON>Todd Marinovich</PERSON> to roll outside his strongside tackle and hand off to <PERSON>Ervins</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing fancy, just power football. But against <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> in <DATE>Monday</DATE>'s <LOCATION>Rose Bowl</LOCATION> 
game, it was a play that buried the <LOCATION>Wolverines</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
With a first down on <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>'s 14-yard line with 1:21 remaining, the Trojans 
again called on <PERSON>Ervins</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
It turned out to be the last time they would need the Rose Bowl game <ORGANIZATION>MVP</ORGANIZATION>. 
Behind <PERSON>Holt</PERSON> and pulling strongside guard <PERSON>Mark Tucker</PERSON>, <PERSON>Ervins</PERSON> powered into the 
<ORGANIZATION>Wolverines</ORGANIZATION>' secondary and received a key block from <PERSON>Gary Wellman</PERSON>. He ran over 
<LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> All-American safety <PERSON>Tripp Welborne</PERSON> at the seven-yard line and 
high-stepped into the end zone, ending <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION>'s two-game losing streak in the Rose 
Bowl game. 
</P>
<P>
"All game long, they couldn't stop it," <PERSON>Ervins</PERSON> said about the "86" play. "We 
just wore them down at the end." 
</P>
<P>
On the final drive, <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION> needed 11 plays to travel 75 yards, but after reaching 
<LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>'s 24-yard line, the Trojans were content to keep the ball on the 
ground to set up a game-winning field goal. 
</P>
<P>
But in the huddle before <PERSON>Ervins</PERSON>' touchdown, the Trojans were confident that 
they could score a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
"Todd came into the huddle and told us that we are going to score on this 
play," <PERSON>Ervins</PERSON> said. "All I said was, 'Oh really?' " 
</P>
<P>
What made <PERSON>Marinovich</PERSON> so sure of his prediction was the Trojans' previous 
blocking success with the play. 
</P>
<P>
"It (the play) worked all day," <PERSON>Marinovich</PERSON> said. "I told the line to stay on 
their blocks a little longer and he (<PERSON>Ervins</PERSON>) will score, just like he did." 
</P>
<P>
With All-Pacific 10 tight end <PERSON>Scott Galbraith</PERSON> helping senior tackle <PERSON>Bill 
Schultz</PERSON> on a double-team block of <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> defensive tackle <PERSON>Sylvester Stanley</PERSON>, 
the Trojans were able to open a hole for <PERSON>Holt</PERSON> and <PERSON>Tucker</PERSON> to clear for <PERSON>Ervins</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
"We were this close from breaking it every time we had ran it," <PERSON>Galbraith</PERSON> said, 
holding his thumb and index finger an inch apart. "Their defensive line was big 
and strong, but I was surprised that they were so blockable." 
</P>
<P>
USC quarterback coach <PERSON>Ray Dorr</PERSON>, who did most of the play calling from the press 
box, said that Coach <PERSON>Larry Smith</PERSON> called for the winning play. 
</P>
<P>
"Coach <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> said that he wanted to run the ball off-tackle to run off some of 
the clock," <PERSON>Dorr</PERSON> said. "When I heard he had made the call, I said 'Great.' It 
wasn't a hard call." 
</P>
<P>
USC did not use the play until its sixth game against <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"The play has always worked for us," <PERSON>Tucker</PERSON> said. "And today, we knew that 
<PERSON>Ricky</PERSON> was close to breaking it into the end zone every time we ran it. 
</P>
<P>
"They never made any kind of adjustments and they never were able to stop it. 
When I pull around like that, it becomes like a sweep for me." 
</P>
<P>
Ervins, a junior, began the season as third-string tailback. On his first "86" 
carry, <PERSON>Ervins</PERSON> gained 12 yards. He carried 30 times for 126 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"The offensive line was blocking great all game," <PERSON>Ervins</PERSON> said, who used to work 
as a Rose Bowl parking attendant when he played at <ORGANIZATION>Pasadena Muir High</ORGANIZATION>. "Early 
in the game I was not hitting the right holes, but they where there. It was 
just up to me to make the runs." 
</P>
<P>
It was <PERSON>Ervins</PERSON>' eighth 100-yard rushing game of the season and he finished with 
1,395 yards, 12th in school history. He joins <PERSON>Charles White</PERSON> (<DATE>1979</DATE> and <DATE>1980</DATE>), 
<PERSON>Sam Cunningham</PERSON> (<DATE>1973</DATE>), <PERSON>O.J. Simpson</PERSON> (<DATE>1968</DATE>) and <PERSON>Erny Pinckett</PERSON> (<DATE>1932</DATE>) as Trojan 
running backs named Rose Bowl game <ORGANIZATION>MVP</ORGANIZATION>.

JIM MURRAY: BO'S FAREWELL IS BY THE BOOK;

<P>
DESPITE LOSS, BO WON'T GO OUT LIKE A LAMB

<TEXT>
<P>
It would have been a shame for <PERSON>Bo Schembechler</PERSON>'s career to end in a tie. A tie 
is -- what? A dance with your sister, a kiss from a French general, a card game 
with your aunt? A title fight shouldn't end in a draw, a war shouldn't end in a 
stalemate at <LOCATION>Panmunjom</LOCATION>. A great career shouldn't end in a tie. 
</P>
<P>
Golfers don't lay up in <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Opens, cleanup hitters don't bunt in the World 
Series, tennis players don't send up lobs in the fifth set at <LOCATION>Wimbledon</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
And <PERSON>Bo Schembechler</PERSON> didn't fall on the ball in the 76th Rose Bowl <DATE>Monday</DATE>. He 
went out with his guns out, his boots on. He didn't say "I'll play these." He 
faded the shooter. He wanted to go out the way he came in -- breathing 
defiance, daring the tiger, knocking the chip off the shoulder of the bully. 
His way. 
</P>
<P>
So, <PERSON>Bo</PERSON> didn't go out with a whimper. His team didn't tie one for the old Bo. Bo 
didn't even punt. Bo didn't just call. Bo bumped the pot, didn't stand on any 
18. He went for the pin. 
</P>
<P>
So, he didn't go out with a any chicken-salad tie. He went out a loser. 
</P>
<P>
The situation was this: Bo's <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> team had somehow managed to tie the 
score, 10-10. No one knows how. USC was faster, deeper and, on the whole, 
niftier, than <PERSON>Bo</PERSON>'s team. But they kept shooting themselves in the foot. 
</P>
<P>
Now, with about 7:30 to play, the situation was this: Bo's team had the ball on 
its 46-yard line, fourth down and two to go. You punt in that situation. Even 
if you're behind. Tied, you punt for certain. 
</P>
<P>
Bo didn't. His punter took the ball and set sail around left end for 24 yards 
to <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION>'s 30-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
There goes the old ballgame, right? I mean, from there <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> goes in to 
score, chewing up the clock as it goes. A game-winning call has just been made. 
A field goal at least, right? 
</P>
<P>
Well, you have to understand Bo and the Rose Bowl. What the famine was to Job, 
the plague to <PERSON>Joseph</PERSON>, the Rose Bowl was to Bo -- a hoodoo. A cross to bear. 
</P>
<P>
Bo's first Rose Bowl game, he had a heart attack. And the situation went 
downhill from there. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't a game, it was a jinx. Bo lost two Rose Bowl games because enemy 
teams failed to punt on fourth down in their own territory. Stanford did it to 
him in <DATE>1972</DATE>. <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> did it in <DATE>1978</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
So, Bo finally turned the tables? Guess again. As the play is finished, this 
little yellow handkerchief comes fluttering out on the field. Play nullified. 
Victory nullified. Ten-yard penalty. Bo is entitled to say, "Me again, huh, 
God?" 
</P>
<P>
On the sidelines, Bo goes quietly crazy. He swells up with rage, charges the 
official. He is berserk. 
</P>
<P>
Bad Bo. Fifteen-yard penalty. Move the ball back to the <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> 21. 
</P>
<P>
Now, punt. Now, fold the hand. Take back the blue chips. 
</P>
<P>
That was the pivotal part of the game. Bottom line: Bo loses again. He's 2-8 in 
the Rose Bowl. This is a coach who is 194-47-5 at <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>. He was good enough 
to come to 10 Rose Bowls. He always showed up with a smart, well-drilled, 
resourceful, take-no-prisoners, coal yard type of football team. 
Over-achievers, really. 
</P>
<P>
He may have cost his team this Rose Bowl. The resultant punt, after <PERSON>Bo</PERSON>'s 
tantrum and penalty, from the 21 is barely adequate. USC is in position to 
mount a closing drive that produced a touchdown with 1:10 left to play. 
</P>
<P>
The betting in the press interview room is even-money whether Bo will show up 
after this dismal loss. His mentor, the late <PERSON>Woody Hayes</PERSON>, would have stayed in 
the bunker and licked his wounds and cursed the Fates -- to say nothing of the 
refs. 
</P>
<P>
If he does show up, the betting is 1-to-5 he'll be coming into the room like a 
crashing plane. Aflame and spewing destruction. 
</P>
<P>
Bo is smiling as he enters the room. He is leaving the <LOCATION>Rose Bowl</LOCATION> as he entered 
it -- a loser. 
</P>
<P>
Only he doesn't act like one. Bo is downright jovial. His team is sobbing in 
the dressing room, he admits, but Bo is still full of fight. Bo doesn't cry. Bo 
attacks. 
</P>
<P>
It is reminiscent of the time <PERSON>Joe Louis</PERSON> lay in a locker room after being 
knocked out by <ORGANIZATION>Rocky Marciano</ORGANIZATION>. Around him, people are tearing their hair, 
ripping their garments, crying out to the heavens. Louis opened an eye, looked 
up. "Hey!" he protested. "I knocked out lots of guys!" 
</P>
<P>
Bo didn't go out crying. He knocked out lots of guys, too. 
</P>
<P>
But he didn't forgive the officials. 
</P>
<P>
"First of all," he said, "we didn't deserve to win the game. We were miserable 
in the first half. I don't think we played well all day. It surprised me we 
gave up so many yards. Was SC faster than us? Well, we didn't think so going 
in." 
</P>
<P>
The call that cost him all chance at the <DATE>1990</DATE> Rose Bowl game was not so 
charitably viewed by Bo. "Most unbelievable call," <PERSON>Bo</PERSON> said, shaking his head. 
But he was smiling as he said it. "It was the most ridiculous call ever and, if 
I see the films and decide it was justified, I will be glad to retract. Was it 
a Pac-10 official? Naturally! But I will say that the worst call ever made on 
me here was by a Big Ten official once. 
</P>
<P>
"Today, one guy said it was called because of blocking below the waist. Another 
said it was old-fashioned holding. I'll guarantee you it was a late call. 
</P>
<P>
"Will they take it up with the supervisory officials? Listen, I want you to 
know, in the history of the game, according to supervisory officials, there has 
never been a bad call. 
</P>
<P>
"You want to know what my humble opinion is? My humble opinion is that the game 
has passed up (the capabilities) of all amateur officials. It's too fast, it's 
too complex. It should have competent, professional officials." 
</P>
<P>
So, the <LOCATION>Rose Bowl</LOCATION> is not going to have <PERSON>Bo Schembechler</PERSON> to kick around any more. 
It's probably fitting he went out the way he came in. The Rose Bowl remained 
his bete noire to the end, the cloud over his head, his personal hex. 
</P>
<P>
Bo never got the hang of it. He never lost by more than a touchdown except once 
when he lost by 10 points -- to <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>'83</DATE>. He never flinched, got reckless, 
or even played the game of a desperate man. The Rose Bowl always knew it was in 
a fight. 
</P>
<P>
Bo could beat <ORGANIZATION>Ohio State</ORGANIZATION>, Bo could win Big Ten titles, Bo could even beat <LOCATION>Notre 
Dame</LOCATION> if it came to that. Bo was just overmatched by a hex, not a team. 
Actually, he almost beat USC -- and the hex -- <DATE>Monday</DATE>. He took his shot. The 
Rose Bowl just got on its broom and flew away, cackling. The old bawd never 
gave Bo an honest cut of the cards. 
</P>
<P>
Bo will miss the Rose Bowl. But not as much as the <ORGANIZATION>Rose Bowl</ORGANIZATION> will miss Bo.

LODISH REMEMBERS WOLVERINES; 
</P>
<P>
UCLA LINEMAN HAS HOME BRAGGING RIGHTS IN MIND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Growing up in <LOCATION>Birmingham</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mich.</LOCATION>, near <PERSON>Ann Arbor</PERSON>, <PERSON>Mike Lodish</PERSON> was pressured 
extensively to play for the <LOCATION>Michigan Wolverines</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
But he never regretted enrolling at <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"It came down to <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> and I came out West for some reasons I don't 
want to discuss," said <PERSON>Lodish</PERSON>, a 6-foot-3, 260-pound senior defensive tackle. 
"I enjoyed the (UCLA) coaching staff, the way I was treated and I wanted to get 
away from home and grow up a little bit and not have the comfort of being only 
45 minutes from home." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Lodish</PERSON> said it wasn't easy to resist a personality such as <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> Coach <PERSON>Bo 
Schembechler</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember him as a gut-tough, hard-nosed coach," <PERSON>Lodish</PERSON> said. "When I was 
being recruited, there were five high school All-Americans coming out of 
<LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION>Michigan State</ORGANIZATION> got four of them. There was always the pressure on 
me that you're a <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> boy and have to play here, that you're a 
Michigan-type person. 
</P>
<P>
"When <PERSON>Bo Schembechler</PERSON> came into your house, he demanded your attention. It was 
almost like it was his house, basically. He's kind of like a Woody Hayes-type 
coach. But I felt <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION> was the school for me." 
</P>
<P>
When <PERSON>Lodish</PERSON> eventually told <PERSON>Schembechler</PERSON> and his offensive coordinator, <PERSON>Gary 
Moeller</PERSON>, that he was going to <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION>, they asked him to delay his decision. 
</P>
<P>
"When I called Bo and told him I was going to <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION>, he went nuts a little bit," 
<PERSON>Lodish</PERSON> said. "He said, 'I'm coming to your house. You stay home.' So he and 
<PERSON>Gary Moeller</PERSON> came to my house. Who knows? Maybe I should have gone to <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>. 
They were really on me to go to <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>." 
</P>
<P>
In other words, if <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION> Coach <PERSON>Terry Donahue</PERSON> is concerned about his Bruins 
having enough intensity this weekend against the <LOCATION>Wolverines</LOCATION>, he need not worry 
about <PERSON>Lodish</PERSON>, who has an agenda of his own. He has some bragging rights at home 
to attend to. 
</P>
<P>
And he wouldn't mind playing <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> again this season . . . in the Rose Bowl 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, he could only take some satisfaction in <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>'s <DATE>22-14</DATE> Rose Bowl 
victory over <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"I was jumping for joy," he said. "Whenever anyone plays USC, I want <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION> to 
lose. It made me sick losing to <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION> because I came out here to play in the Rose 
Bowl game." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Lodish</PERSON> said that he was mentioned on <PERSON>Schembechler</PERSON>'s television show as a player 
who slipped away from <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what he thinks of me as a football player and that doesn't 
matter, but I'm sure he knows who I am," <PERSON>Lodish</PERSON> said, "and their offense is 
going to know who I am." 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION> lineman recalls past recruiting days when <PERSON>Moeller</PERSON> and <PERSON>Schembechler</PERSON> 
tried to persuade him that he was going 3,000 miles away from home and wouldn't 
play because the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> boys would be playing. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a challenge itself," <PERSON>Lodish</PERSON> said. "They were trying to beat 'Go Blue' 
into my head, but it really wasn't working. 
</P>
<P>
"I just felt that <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION> would be a better school for me outside of football, 
getting contacts in business." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Lodish</PERSON> said he became interested in <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION> when the Bruins beat the <LOCATION>Wolverines</LOCATION>, 
24-14, in the <DATE>1983</DATE> Rose Bowl game. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember that hit by (defensive back) <PERSON>Don Rogers</PERSON> on (quarterback) <PERSON>Steve 
Smith</PERSON> in the Rose Bowl game. I thought this program is for real, that defense 
is for real." 
</P>
<P>
Although <PERSON>Lodish</PERSON> is emotionally ready for <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>'s game, he is aware, of 
course, that <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> is a formidable opponent. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to have to play our best to beat them," he said. "They're an 
excellent football team. They've got a tremendous attack and, being from 
<LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>, I know how <PERSON>Bo Schembechler</PERSON> is. They lost (last week) and <PERSON>Bo 
Schembechler</PERSON> doesn't like to lose, especially at home when he knows he could 
have won. They'll be pumped up." 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, so will <PERSON>Lodish</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
UCLA Notes 
</P>
<P>
UCLA Coach <PERSON>Terry Donahue</PERSON> said his team improved some in a 28-25 victory over 
<LOCATION>San Diego State</LOCATION> <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>, adding: "Obviously, we have a long, long way to 
go to become a good football team and improve. We have an opportunity to take a 
big step this week when we play <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>. But you have to be blind to not 
realize what kind of football team they have." . . . <PERSON>Donahue</PERSON> also noted in a 
<LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> press release that Coach <PERSON>Bo Schembechler</PERSON> wants to improve his team's 
running game, which was shut down to some extent by <ORGANIZATION>Notre Dame</ORGANIZATION>. "I don't think 
you can win in football with passing alone," <PERSON>Schembechler</PERSON> said. "And no matter 
how well we pass the ball, that's not going to satisfy me until we will be able 
to punch holes in the defense and run." . . . Said Donahue: "I think he meant 
that for us. I take it personally." 
</P>
<P>
Bruin injury report: Nose tackle <PERSON>Jon Pryor</PERSON> (broken thumb), tailback <PERSON>Shawn Wills</PERSON> 
(sprained ankle), wide receiver <PERSON>Laurence Burkley</PERSON> (dislocated knee), defensive 
back <PERSON>Eric Nelson</PERSON> (torn knee ligaments) and tailback <PERSON>Ricky Davis</PERSON> (broken thumb). 
They're reportedly out of the <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> game. "I don't think Wills will play, 
but he thinks he will and, if the player thinks so, he usually does," <PERSON>Donahue</PERSON> 
said. As for <PERSON>Pryor</PERSON>, a starter, <PERSON>Donahue</PERSON> says he may be out for a while. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Donahue</PERSON> said that quarterback <PERSON>Bret Johnson</PERSON> had a creditable game against <ORGANIZATION>San 
Diego State</ORGANIZATION>. "His greatest asset is that he is extremely competitive," <PERSON>Donahue</PERSON> 
said. "If every member of our team was as competitive, we would have a great 
team. He thrives on games." . . . <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION> is off to a shaky start, losing to 
<LOCATION>Tennessee</LOCATION>, 24-6, and coming from behind to beat <LOCATION>San Diego State</LOCATION>, a team that 
wasn't supposed to be in <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION>'s class. Said <PERSON>Donahue</PERSON>: "<LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> is one of the 
top teams in the country. It's an opportunity for our team to step forward and 
show our colors." 
</P>
<P>
Schembechler announced in <PERSON>Ann Arbor</PERSON> that freshman <ORGANIZATION>Elvis Grbac</ORGANIZATION> will be the 
<ORGANIZATION>Wolverines</ORGANIZATION>' starting quarterback this week. Senior starter <PERSON>Michael Taylor</PERSON> 
bruised his back <DATE>last Saturday</DATE> in <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>'s 24-19 loss to <LOCATION>Notre Dame</LOCATION>. Grbac 
replaced him in the <DATE>third quarter</DATE> and completed 17 of 21 passes for 134 yards 
and two touchdowns. . . . <ORGANIZATION>Fullback Jarrod Bunch</ORGANIZATION> also will miss the <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION> game 
after injuring a knee against <ORGANIZATION>Notre Dame</ORGANIZATION>. His replacement will be <PERSON>Leroy Hoard</PERSON>, 
who was the most valuable player last <DATE>January</DATE> in <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>'s <DATE>22-14</DATE> Rose Bowl 
victory over <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION>. Hoard, who ran for 142 yards and two touchdowns against <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION>, 
alternated at tailback last week with <PERSON>Tony Boles</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
Dean <PERSON>Dingman</PERSON>, a 6-2, 292-pound offensive guard, lost 30 pounds in the week 
before the <ORGANIZATION>Notre Dame</ORGANIZATION> game because of strep throat, <PERSON>Schembechler</PERSON> said, and is 
questionable for this week. . . . <PERSON>Gulam Khan</PERSON>, who had two kickoffs returned for 
touchdowns by <ORGANIZATION>Notre Dame</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Raghib Ismail</PERSON>, broke an arm when hit by a blocker 
during <ORGANIZATION>Ismail</ORGANIZATION>'s <DATE>fourth-quarter</DATE> runback.

<HEAD>NBC Wins Ratings and Top Two Places Go To Cosby and `Cheers'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NBC's ``The Cosby Show'' and ``Cheers'' tied
for first in the <LOCATION>Nielsen</LOCATION> ratings for <DATE>last week</DATE> after playing second
string to football the previous week.
   None of the post-season bowl games were in the top 10 <DATE>last week</DATE>,
and several ranked near the bottom of the ratings. Football
dominated the ratings the previous week.
   ABC's ``Roseanne'' was third in a week that began to look like
normal again. CBS' ``60 Minutes'' and ``Murder, She Wrote'' made it
back into the top 10. CBS' ``Designing Women,'' which had a
one-hour special episode with guest star <PERSON>Dolly Parton</PERSON> and featured
the birth of <LOCATION>Charlene</LOCATION>'s baby, was No. 10.
   The highest ranked football game last week was <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION>'s coverage of
the <ORGANIZATION>Colorado-Notre Dame</ORGANIZATION> game in the Orange Bowl, which tied for
12th.
   NBC's coverage of the <ORGANIZATION>American Football League</ORGANIZATION> playoff between
<LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION> got a higher rating for its run over into
prime time on <DATE>Sunday</DATE>. The game, however, was not on the official
<PERSON>Nielsen</PERSON> list. NBC and <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION> listed the run over as 12th and the
Orange Bowl as 13th, but the pro game was not listed by <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION>.
   NBC handily won the <ORGANIZATION>A.C. Nielsen Co.</ORGANIZATION> ratings for the week, and
<ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION> regained second place. The network averages: NBC 15.8, CBS
13.4, ABC 12.1. A ratings point represents the percentage of the
nation's 92.1 million television homes tuned to a show.
   Season to date, <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION> leads with an average of 14.8 to <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION>'s 12.9
and <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION>' 12.2.
   Here's the top 10: <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION>'s ``The Cosby Show'' and ``Cheers'' tied;
<ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION>'s ``Roseanne''; <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION>'s ``The Golden Girls''; <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION>' ``60
Minutes''; <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION>'s ``A Different World''; <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION>' ``Murder, She Wrote'';
<ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION>'s ``Empty Nest'' and <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION>'s ``Wonder Years'' tied; and <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION>'
``Designing Women.''
   CBS' ``Murder in Black and White,'' the third movie with <PERSON>Richard
Crenna</PERSON> in the same role as a <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> police detective, was 20th.
Its <DATE>Sunday</DATE> competition, the first part of the two-part <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION>
miniseries ``Drug Wars: The Camarena Story'' was in a three-way tie
for 34th.
   Two police shows debuted last week. ABC's ``Father Dowling
Mysteries'' was 46th and <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION>' ``<PERSON>Max Monroe</PERSON>: Loose Cannon'' was 58th.
   Here's the standing for the other bowl games: <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION>'s Rose Bowl
tied for 28th, <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION>'s Fiesta Bowl 61st and <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION>'s Sugar Bowl 75th.
   CBS won first place among the <TIME>evening</TIME> news shows after a long
winning streak by <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION>'s ``World News Tonight.'' ABC trailed in
second place by a tenth of a point. ``The <ORGANIZATION>CBS Evening News</ORGANIZATION>'' was on
five days <DATE>last week</DATE>, while <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION> did not have <DATE>Monday</DATE> shows on
New Years Day. The ratings: CBS 12.0, <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION> 11.9, <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION> 11.0.

Winners and losers in this year's bowl sweeps: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Loser: Fiesta Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
From New Year's Day giant to scapegoat. Organizers came very close to canceling 
the game because of the polarization caused by the defeated <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luthur King 
Jr.</ORGANIZATION> holiday referendum. They even considered a move to <PERSON>Jack Murphy</PERSON> Stadium in 
<LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>, but that was shot down by the <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION>. Just as well: It would have been 
a public relations and logistics catastrophe. Making matters worse, the <LOCATION>Fiesta</LOCATION> 
wanted <LOCATION>Notre Dame</LOCATION>; it got <LOCATION>Louisville</LOCATION>. A banner week, it wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Loser: Copper Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
See Fiesta Bowl. The <ORGANIZATION>NAACP</ORGANIZATION> already has condemned <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> for accepting an 
invitation to play in the Tucson-based bowl. Not exactly the sort of publicity 
the Copper Bowl folks were hoping for. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Winner: <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
When <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION> were beaten <DATE>last Saturday</DATE>, thus giving every team in the 
Big Ten at least two losses, the idea of inviting the conference runner-up 
became less appealing to the Sugar Bowl selection committee. Enter the 
<ORGANIZATION>Cavaliers</ORGANIZATION>, who solved all sorts of problems -- theirs and the Sugar Bowl's -- 
by accepting the bid to travel to <LOCATION>New Orleans</LOCATION>. <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION>, which previously had 
been considering the <LOCATION>Fiesta Bowl</LOCATION>, earns about <MONEY>$700,000</MONEY> more by playing in the 
Sugar Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Winner: <LOCATION>Southern Mississippi</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The 25th-ranked Golden Eagles, previously destined for the Independence Bowl 
and a fun-filled stay in, uh, <LOCATION>Shreveport</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>La.</LOCATION>, upgraded to the All-American 
Bowl. The payout -- <MONEY>$600,000</MONEY> -- is the same, but <LOCATION>Southern Mississippi</LOCATION> gets <ORGANIZATION>ESPN</ORGANIZATION> 
instead of <ORGANIZATION>Mizlou</ORGANIZATION> and a <DATE>Dec. 28</DATE> playing date rather than <DATE>Dec. 15</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Loser: Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Beware of purple bandwagons. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Winner: <LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The Cornhuskers panicked and committed themselves to the Citrus Bowl long 
before they needed to. Turns out to be a great move, especially now that 
<ORGANIZATION>Georgia Tech</ORGANIZATION>, ranked No. 4, is the only undefeated team. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Loser: <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The Rebels, ranked 15th, have a good team but little television appeal. Nor are 
they known for bringing lots of fans to bowls. Then again, <LOCATION>Ole Miss</LOCATION> has been to 
only four bowl games in the <DATE>last 20 years</DATE>. The Sugar Bowl is praying the Rebels 
don't win the <ORGANIZATION>Southeastern Conference</ORGANIZATION> title and receive the automatic bid to 
<LOCATION>New Orleans</LOCATION>. The Fiesta Bowl has its choice of the non-SEC winner and, given 
its druthers, would take <LOCATION>Auburn</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION> or <LOCATION>Tennessee</LOCATION> before inviting <LOCATION>Ole Miss</LOCATION>. 
Too bad. The Rebels are worth watching. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Winners: <LOCATION>Notre Dame</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Louisville</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Georgia Tech</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame and <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION> get a national championship rematch. 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>Louisville</LOCATION> gets a <MONEY>$2.5-million</MONEY> Fiesta Bowl paycheck, compared to the <MONEY>$600,000</MONEY> 
payout it would have received from the All-American Bowl. The Cardinals' first 
bowl game since <DATE>1977</DATE> is a New Year's Day game. Their first television 
appearance since <DATE>1983</DATE> is on a major network. Of course, there might be a price 
to be paid for the decision to venture to <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>. We'll see. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Georgia Tech</ORGANIZATION> gets a chance to win a national title if several things happen, 
including another regular-season loss by <ORGANIZATION>Notre Dame</ORGANIZATION>, followed by an Irish 
victory over <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION> in the <LOCATION>Orange Bowl</LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION>Georgia Tech</ORGANIZATION> would then need to 
wallop <LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION> in the Citrus Bowl. Hey, a similar scenario worked for <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION> considered pulling its teams out of Fiesta Bowl contention -- but not 
for long. Two reasons: The decision to play was one for the university 
presidents to determine; and the <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION> office saw nothing morally wrong with 
accepting a Fiesta Bowl bid. 
</P>
<P>
"The general consensus of a lot of people in our conference is that it's 
preposterous to hold the Fiesta Bowl accountable for the actions of the 
voters," said <PERSON>Brad Davis</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION> assistant commissioner. "Those of us here in the 
South are used to the broad swath of indicting everyone for the actions of some 
people. You've got to cut through the grandstanding of the situation and really 
look at the facts. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, where do you stop?" <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> said. "Does an institution not play a bowl 
in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> because (the state) might have a very liberal abortion law? Is 
the <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION> office in <LOCATION>Birmingham</LOCATION> held accountable because the state capitol in 
<LOCATION>Montgomery</LOCATION> flies a rebel flag?" 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Davis</PERSON> said he expects the <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION> to be criticized for participating in the <LOCATION>Fiesta 
Bowl</LOCATION>. "We're going to take some hits on it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Wave goodby to the <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> rule requiring bowl selection committees to wait until 
<DATE>Nov. 24</DATE> to extend official invitations. <PERSON>Dick Schultz</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> executive director, 
said he expects the deadline to be abolished at the organization's convention 
in <DATE>January</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a ridiculous rule," <PERSON>Schultz</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
Bowls can be penalized by the <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> for ignoring the current rule, but it never 
happens. By never formally inviting a team until <DATE>Nov. 24</DATE>, the selection 
committees avoid punishment. 
</P>
<P>
If the <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> has its way, the bowl people themselves will determine their own 
date, if any, for extending bids. And as usual, the bowl people, as they do now 
under the current format, will disregard the guidelines and arrange 
"unofficial" matchups. 
</P>
<P>
"The bowl association will try to come up with some sort of self-regulation 
that would hopefully attempt to keep some sense of order to the selection 
process, not that there's much now," said <PERSON>John Reid</PERSON>, executive director of the 
Holiday Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
"The most likely to be injured are the schools that come on strongly at the end 
of the season." 
</P>
<P>
One other thing to remember about next season: As a safeguard of sorts, a team 
must beat at least six Division I-A opponents to be eligible for a bowl. That 
means the minute a team such as <ORGANIZATION>Notre Dame</ORGANIZATION> wins that sixth game, bowl scouts 
will be there with pens poised. 
</P>
<P>
For those clamoring for a Division I-A football playoff system, take heart. 
<PERSON>Schultz</PERSON> said one is on its way. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just my own personal feeling, but I think that we'll have one before the 
decade is over," he said. "But I think it will be later in the decade, rather 
than earlier in the decade." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Schultz</PERSON> said he envisioned a playoff that would, at first, include only two or 
four teams. 
</P>
<P>
When listing the nation's best running backs, don't forget to include <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION>'s 
<PERSON>Mike Mayweather</PERSON> among the candidates. <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Eric Bieniemy</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Notre Dame</ORGANIZATION>'s 
<PERSON>Raghib Ismail</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Greg Lewis</PERSON> get most of the publicity, but 
<PERSON>Mayweather</PERSON> deserves mention, too. He rushed for 129 yards against <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> 
<DATE>last Saturday</DATE>, which gives him eight 100-yard games this season and 21 in his 
career. . . . <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> receiver <PERSON>Herman Moore</PERSON> isn't expected to return for his 
final year of eligibility. <PERSON>Moore</PERSON>, who has caught touchdown passes in an 
NCAA-record nine consecutive games, hasn't revealed his decision, but all 
indications point to first-round status in the <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> draft. 
</P>
<P>
Our top 10: (1) <LOCATION>Notre Dame</LOCATION>, (2) <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION>, (3) <ORGANIZATION>Georgia Tech</ORGANIZATION>, (4) BYU, (5) <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>,

<LEADPARA>  A college football bowls alliance, designed to make a national championship
matchup likelier each year between the nation's two top-ranked teams, was
announced Wednesday.;    The alliance will include the Orange, Cotton, Sugar
and Fiesta bowls.  </LEADPARA>

MAJOR CHANGE FOR COLLEGE FOOTBALL  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Sports Digest  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Also included are the <LOCATION>Big East</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Atlantic Coast</LOCATION> conferences, which last
year added to their fold perennial national title contenders <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Florida
State</ORGANIZATION>, respectively. The <ORGANIZATION>Big Eight Conference</ORGANIZATION> will continue to send its
champion to the Orange Bowl. Southwest Conference-Cotton Bowl and <ORGANIZATION>Southeastern
Conference-Sugar Bowl</ORGANIZATION> affiliations also will continue.;    The agreement still
must be put into writing.;    Under the plan, scheduled to take effect in the
<DATE>1992</DATE> season, the lineups for the four bowls would be decided by a prearranged
system.;    After the Big Eight, SWC and <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION> champions are determined, the
other slots for the four bowl games would be filled by a five-team pool, which
would include <ORGANIZATION>Notre Dame</ORGANIZATION>, the champions of the <LOCATION>Big East</LOCATION> and ACC, and two other
highly ranked at-large teams. The at-large teams could be independents or
conference members.;    The highest-ranked team in the pool would go to the
bowl that offers the highest-ranked opponent.;    The coalition plans to wait
until after the final regular-season poll in early <DATE>December</DATE> to determine its
bowl pairings.;    The Fiesta Bowl -- which has no conference affiliation --
would play host to the national championship game if the five-team pool
includes the teams ranked No. 1 and No. 2.;    <LOCATION>Notre Dame</LOCATION> and the champions of
the <ORGANIZATION>ACC</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Big East</LOCATION> have the option of declining one bowl's invitation to
play in another bowl within the alliance.;    The deal doesn't ensure that the
two top-ranked teams will meet each <DATE>Jan. 1</DATE>. For example, the No. 1 team might
come from the Big Eight and the No. 2 team from the <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION>, and under that
scenario, the alliance has no provision for putting the teams into the same
bowl.;    The Rose Bowl, which extends automatic berths to the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> 10 and
<ORGANIZATION>Big Ten</ORGANIZATION> champions, might also eclipse the new alliance's top matchup.;    Rose
Bowl officials held no discussions with the alliance.; PRO FOOTBALL: <LOCATION>New
Orleans</LOCATION> defensive lineman <PERSON>Frank Warren</PERSON>, who served a one-year drug suspension,
has been cleared to return to the league, Saints President <PERSON>Jim Finks</PERSON> said. . .
. Cornerback <PERSON>Dwayne Woodruff</PERSON>, 34, the last active member of a <LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION> Super
Bowl champion, retired.; PRO BASKETBALL: The <ORGANIZATION>Milwaukee Bucks</ORGANIZATION> signed center
<PERSON>Moses Malone</PERSON>, 36, to a two-year contract. <PERSON>Malone</PERSON>, an unrestricted free agent,
played for <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> last season.; MISCELLANY: The <ORGANIZATION>University of Arizona</ORGANIZATION> took
the recommendation of a hearing board and exonerated basketball player <PERSON>Khalid
Reeves</PERSON> concerning allegations that he sexually assaulted a female student. . .
. <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> sprinter <PERSON>Michael Johnson</PERSON> ran the season's fastest 400 meters in 44.17
seconds in <LOCATION>Lausanne</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Switzerland</LOCATION>. Merlene Ottey ran the fastest women's 100 in
the world this year with a 10.84 clocking. . . . In <LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Gabriel
Batistuta</PERSON> scored with nine minutes remaining to give <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> a 1-0 victory
over <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION> in the <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> Cup, the South American soccer championship. In the
day's first game, <LOCATION>Paraguay</LOCATION> beat <LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION> 5-0.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>
   <DATE>Friday</DATE>, <DATE>Dec. 26</DATE>, <TIME>9-11 p.m. ET</TIME>, on PBS (PBS air dates and times vary, so check local listings): "Hansel &amp; Gretel." 
This <PERSON>Engelbert Humperdinck</PERSON> never wore tight lame in <LOCATION>Vegas</LOCATION>, but he did write a delightful, musically adult opera based on the <LOCATION>Grimm</LOCATION>'s fairy tale about two lost children and a witch, here performed by an all-star European cast. 
A <ORGANIZATION>Unitel</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Munich</LOCATION> production. 

   ---
   <DATE>Friday</DATE>, <DATE>Dec. 26</DATE>, <TIME>9-11 p.m. ET</TIME>, on CBS: "The Kennedy Center Honors: A Celebration of the Performing Arts." 
Receiving high-toned kudos at the annual awards bash will be <PERSON>Lucille Ball</PERSON>, <PERSON>Ray Charles</PERSON>, <PERSON>Hume Cronyn</PERSON>, <PERSON>Jessica Tandy</PERSON>, <PERSON>Yehudi Menuhin</PERSON> and <PERSON>Antony Tudor</PERSON>. 

   ---
   <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, <DATE>Dec. 27</DATE>, <TIME>10-11 p.m. ET</TIME>, on <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION>: "Diagnosis Malpractice." 
The <ORGANIZATION>ABC News</ORGANIZATION> "Closeup" unit specializes in state-of-the-art documentaries with a punch. 
This one is about two battling titans, the legal and the medical professions, locked in combat over skyrocketing malpractice litigation. 

   ---
   <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, <DATE>Dec. 28</DATE>, <TIME>9-10 p.m. ET</TIME>, on WNYW in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>; various dates and times in other markets served by <ORGANIZATION>Orbis Communications</ORGANIZATION> (check local listings): "The Entrepreneurs, Program III, Expanding America." 
Underwritten by <ORGANIZATION>Wang Laboratories</ORGANIZATION> and hosted by <PERSON>Robert Mitchum</PERSON>, this series of six films pays handsome tribute to the persistence and originality of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s business pioneers. 
If you missed the first two, cheer up. 
They get more lively and contemporary as they go along. 

   ---
   <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, <DATE>Dec. 28</DATE>, <TIME>9-11 p.m. ET</TIME>, on CBS: "The Return of <PERSON>Sherlock Holmes</PERSON>." 
The remarkable <PERSON>Holmes</PERSON> still receives over 1,500 letters a year, so perhaps it's not too far-fetched to imagine, with this TV movie, that he exists somewhere in a cryogenic slumber, just waiting to start sleuthing again. 
The accomplished British actor <PERSON>Michael Pennington</PERSON> stars in this . . . uh, revival. 

   ---
   <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, <DATE>Dec. 31</DATE>, 11:30 p.m.-1 or <TIME>1:30 a.m.</TIME>, all three networks: New Year's Eve. 
Folks, <DATE>1987</DATE> was bound to come. 
Nothing to do except toast the cherub, swill champagne and channel-zap between <PERSON>Johnny Carson</PERSON>, <PERSON>Gladys Knight</PERSON> &amp; the Pips, the hot crowd at <ORGANIZATION>Times Square</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Dick Clark</PERSON>, <PERSON>David Letterman</PERSON>, and the sizzling mob at <LOCATION>L.A.</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Vertigo Club</ORGANIZATION>. 
I could tell you which is on which network, but that would spoil the fun. 

   ---
   <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, <DATE>Jan. 1</DATE>, from the hour you rise till the hour you drop, all three networks will be offering Football and Parades (all times ET). 
The Cotton Bowl Parade will kick off the big day in <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> at <TIME>10 a.m.</TIME> on <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION>; the pre-Rose Bowl Tournament of Roses Parade marches through <LOCATION>Pasadena</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, at <TIME>11 a.m.</TIME> on <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION>; the Citrus Bowl (<ORGANIZATION>Auburn vs. 
USC</ORGANIZATION>) starts at noon on ABC; the Cotton Bowl (<LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> A&amp;M vs. 
<ORGANIZATION>Ohio State</ORGANIZATION>) begins at <TIME>1:30 p.m.</TIME> on <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION>; the Sugar Bowl (<LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION> vs. 
LSU) in <LOCATION>New Orleans</LOCATION> is on ABC at <TIME>3:30 p.m.</TIME>; the Rose Bowl (<ORGANIZATION>Arizona State</ORGANIZATION> vs. 
<LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>) will be broadcast at <TIME>4:30 p.m.</TIME> on <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION>, followed on the same network by the Orange Bowl from <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> (<LOCATION>Oklahoma vs. 
Arkansas</LOCATION>) at <TIME>8 p.m.</TIME> 

   ---
   <DATE>Thursdays, Jan. 1-15</DATE>, <TIME>9-10 p.m. ET</TIME>, on PBS: "A Murder is Announced." 
Truly, here is a Miss Marple (<PERSON>Joan Hickson</PERSON>) who surpasses the amusing (but-untrue-to-the-Agatha-Christie- original) <PERSON>Margaret Rutherford</PERSON>. 
She appears rather late in the first episode, so wait patiently. 
She's worth it. 

   ---
   <DATE>Friday</DATE>, <DATE>Jan. 2</DATE>, <TIME>8-11 p.m. ET</TIME>, on <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION>: The game everyone is waiting for: The Fiesta Bowl. 
<LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> (<LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>) led by <ORGANIZATION>Heisman Trophy</ORGANIZATION> winner <PERSON>Vinny Testaverde</PERSON> faces <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Tempe</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ariz.</LOCATION>, for the Division 1-A Championship. 

   ---
   <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, <DATE>Jan. 4</DATE> and <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, <DATE>Jan. 6</DATE>, <TIME>9-11 p.m. ET</TIME>, on CBS: "At Mother's Request." 
Those who relished the twisted tale of <PERSON>Frances Schreuder</PERSON>, the heiress who manipulated her son into murdering her millionaire father, will also relish the fact that both <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION> have made miniseries about the crime. 
First to air is this whodunit version starring <PERSON>Stefanie Powers</PERSON>; it focuses on crime-solving more than on character-delving, but it's riveting nonetheless. 

   ---
   <DATE>Monday</DATE>, <DATE>Jan. 5</DATE>, <TIME>10-11 p.m. ET</TIME>, on <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION>: "To Be A Teacher." 
Sponsored solely by <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION>, this <ORGANIZATION>NBC White Paper</ORGANIZATION> will sober you up really quickly on the subject of what it's like to be in charge of a public-school classroom nowadays. 

   ---
   <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, <DATE>Jan. 7</DATE>, <TIME>10-11 p.m. ET</TIME>, on PBS: "Back at the Ranch." 
Cattle are more tractable than students, but it's no picnic being a rancher, either. 
This production of <LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION> public TV is a bit on the slow side, but it's also fair, interesting and informative.

So many bowls, so few great teams. 
</P>
<P>
Consider: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Not one undefeated and untied team will play in a bowl this season. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Only <PERSON>Brigham Young</PERSON>, among the bowl candidates, can win 11 regular-season 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Only seven others have a legitimate chance at 10 victories, and one of 
those teams, <LOCATION>Notre Dame</LOCATION>, has to play <LOCATION>Tennessee</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION> 
can win 10, but it will have played 12 games and also benefited from the 
infamous fifth-down victory over <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Only eight are likely to win nine games, and that might be a generous 
estimate. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Only seven will probably manage eight victories and only seven are likely 
to win seven games. 
</P>
<P>
 -- If projections hold true, nine other bowl candidates will have only six 
victories. 
</P>
<P>
There are 19 bowls and, at the moment, about 40 teams available to fill those 
38 openings. Invitations are supposed to be presented on <DATE>Nov. 24</DATE>, but nobody 
has ever accused bowl officials of paying attention to their calendars. 
</P>
<P>
Presenting our best guesses . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Big Five: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Orange Bowl. <ORGANIZATION>Colorado vs. Notre Dame</ORGANIZATION> or <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>, but the Hurricanes will be 
invited only if <ORGANIZATION>Notre Dame</ORGANIZATION> loses to <LOCATION>Tennessee</LOCATION> <DATE>Saturday</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Sugar Bowl. Southeastern Conference champion (probably <LOCATION>Tennessee</LOCATION>) vs. 
<LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Notre Dame</LOCATION> or <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Cotton Bowl. <ORGANIZATION>Southwest Conference</ORGANIZATION> champion (probably <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, since 
undefeated and untied <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION> is ineligible) vs. <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Notre Dame</LOCATION> or <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Fiesta Bowl. <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> vs. <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Rose Bowl. <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> vs. Big Ten champion (probably <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>). 
</P>
<P>
The Medium Six: Citrus -- <ORGANIZATION>Georgia Tech</ORGANIZATION> vs. <LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION>; Gator -- <ORGANIZATION>Auburn vs. Ohio 
State</ORGANIZATION>; Holiday -- Western Athletic Conference champion (probably <ORGANIZATION>Brigham Young</ORGANIZATION>) 
vs. <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> A&amp;M; <PERSON>Hall</PERSON> of Fame -- Clemson vs. <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>; Liberty -- <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> vs. 
<LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION> or <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION>; Blockbuster -- <ORGANIZATION>Florida State vs. Ohio State</ORGANIZATION> or 
<LOCATION>Louisville</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The Rest: Copper -- <LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION> vs. <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>; <PERSON>John Hancock</PERSON> -- <LOCATION>Michigan State vs. 
USC</LOCATION>; Freedom -- <LOCATION>Colorado State vs. Oregon</LOCATION>; <LOCATION>Peach</LOCATION> -- <LOCATION>North Carolina State</LOCATION> or 
<LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION> vs. <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION> or <LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION>; All-American -- <LOCATION>Louisville</LOCATION> vs. <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION>; 
<LOCATION>Aloha</LOCATION> -- <LOCATION>Syracuse vs. Arizona</LOCATION>; <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> -- <LOCATION>San Jose State</LOCATION> or <LOCATION>Fresno State vs. 
Central Michigan</LOCATION>; Independence -- Baylor vs. LSU or <LOCATION>Southern Mississippi</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Teams on the bubble: <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> Christian and <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
As usual, <ORGANIZATION>Notre Dame</ORGANIZATION> is the center of attention. A victory over <LOCATION>Tennessee</LOCATION> will 
allow the Irish to delay a commitment and help the Sugar Bowl's chances of 
landing <LOCATION>Notre Dame</LOCATION>. An Auburn or <ORGANIZATION>Mississippi vs. Notre Dame</ORGANIZATION> game remains a 
possibility. 
</P>
<P>
If <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION> finishes the season undefeated and untied, Cougar fans are calling 
for <ORGANIZATION>Associated Press</ORGANIZATION> voters to crown the team as national champion. Four 
questions: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Does a team on <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> probation deserve to be eligible for a national title? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Should a team be voted No. 1 without playing a bowl game? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Should a team whose schedule includes <LOCATION>Eastern Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Nevada Las Vegas</LOCATION>, 
<ORGANIZATION>Southern Methodist</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Rice</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Texas Tech</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Arizona State</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION> -- who have a 
combined record of 21-40 and only one of these seven, <LOCATION>Eastern Washington</LOCATION> (5-4), 
has a winning record -- be seriously considered as national championship 
material? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Would the best team in the country allow <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> Christian's second-string 
quarterback to throw for an NCAA-record 690 yards against it? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: A No. 1 vote for <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION>, undefeated and untied or not, is a vote 
wasted. 
</P>
<P>
One more <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION> item: We don't have a Heisman Trophy ballot, but if we did, we 
wouldn't penalize <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION> quarterback <PERSON>David Klingler</PERSON> for directing a 
run-and-shoot offense that produces outrageous point and yardage totals. 
</P>
<P>
To do so would be the same as penalizing quarterback <PERSON>Ty Detmer</PERSON> for <ORGANIZATION>BYU</ORGANIZATION>'s 
intricate passing attack, or <PERSON>Darian Hagan</PERSON> and <PERSON>Eric Bieniemy</PERSON> for <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION>'s 
option offense, or <PERSON>Raghib Ismail</PERSON> for <ORGANIZATION>Notre Dame</ORGANIZATION>'s plan to get him the ball -- 
by pass, handoff or special teams -- at least 20 times a game. Offensive 
systems and philosophies are nice, but without the right players, they flop. 
</P>
<P>
We also wouldn't dismiss <PERSON>Klingler</PERSON> as a leading candidate simply because former 
<PERSON>Cougar Andre Ware</PERSON> won the Heisman last year. One doesn't average more than four 
touchdown passes and 443 yards a game, as <PERSON>Klingler</PERSON> has this season, by 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
And for those critics who say the run-and-shoot is designed for short gains, 
think again. Of <PERSON>Klingler</PERSON>'s seven touchdown pass plays last week against <ORGANIZATION>TCU</ORGANIZATION>, 
six of them traveled 35 yards or more -- 36, 42, 46, 59, 80 and 88. 
</P>
<P>
Klingler should consider himself lucky. Heisman candidate <PERSON>Shawn Moore</PERSON>, 
<LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION>'s multitalented quarterback, was scheduled to appear on <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION>'s "Today 
Show" last <DATE>Monday</DATE>. But after the Cavaliers were upset by <ORGANIZATION>Georgia Tech</ORGANIZATION>, the 
network called <DATE>Sunday</DATE> and canceled the request. Never mind that <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> accounted 
for four <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> touchdowns in the loss. Instead, <PERSON>Ismail</PERSON> and <PERSON>Klingler</PERSON> were 
interviewed. All in all, a classless move by <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION> to omit <PERSON>Moore</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing against the <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> sports information department, but it pushed the 
wrong <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> for the Heisman. Herman, not <PERSON>Shawn</PERSON>, is the best Cavalier player 
and, according to <ORGANIZATION>Georgia Tech</ORGANIZATION> Coach <PERSON>Bobby Ross</PERSON>, the best wide receiver in the 
country. He caught nine passes for 234 yards and one touchdown <DATE>Saturday</DATE>. <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> 
has at least one touchdown reception in his last 10 games and 15 of his <DATE>last 
16</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
And for what it's worth, <LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION> Coach <PERSON>Bill Curry</PERSON>, whose son plays for 
<LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION>, said that Cavalier Coach <PERSON>George Welsh</PERSON> had no choice but to kick a 
tying field goal against <ORGANIZATION>Georgia Tech</ORGANIZATION> with 2:34 remaining. The alternative: a 
fourth-and-goal situation at the Yellow Jacket six-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have done the same thing," said <PERSON>Curry</PERSON>, who attended the game. Of 
course, <ORGANIZATION>Georgia Tech</ORGANIZATION> got the ball back, drove down the field and kicked a 
game-winning field goal. As for <ORGANIZATION>Curry</ORGANIZATION>, he couldn't have been too upset. After 
all, he's a <ORGANIZATION>Georgia Tech</ORGANIZATION> graduate and a former <ORGANIZATION>Georgia Tech</ORGANIZATION> head coach. 
</P>
<P>
How tough was it to get a ticket to <DATE>last Saturday</DATE>'s game at <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION>, 
<LOCATION>Va.</LOCATION>? Well, as part of <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION>'s annual basketball scrimmage, musician <PERSON>Bruce 
Hornsby</PERSON> and actor <PERSON>Woody Harrelson</PERSON> of "Cheers" fame agreed to serve as honorary 
coaches. Hornsby, who received no cash appearance fee, later said that one of 
the reasons he accepted the coaching invitation was the promise of a 
<ORGANIZATION>Virginia-Georgia Tech</ORGANIZATION> football ticket. He got one. . . . <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION> isn't going to 
win the <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION>, but it might win six games, which is an accomplishment considering 
that the Crimson Tide lost their first three this season. The Tide hasn't 
allowed a touchdown in 12 quarters. . . . <LOCATION>Louisville</LOCATION> is ranked in the AP poll 
for the first time in 18 years. 
</P>
<P>
After 21 years as a college coach, <ORGANIZATION>Notre Dame</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Lou Holtz</PERSON> will take his No. 
1-ranked team to <LOCATION>Knoxville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Tenn.</LOCATION>, and 91,110-seat <LOCATION>Neyland Stadium</LOCATION> for the 
first time <DATE>Saturday</DATE>. Already, <PERSON>Holtz</PERSON> has called several colleagues, including 
former <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION> coach <PERSON>Ray Perkins</PERSON>, and asked how to deal with the deafening 
crowd noise. 
</P>
<P>
"I figure I'll call until I find someone who has something nice to say about 
it," <PERSON>Holtz</PERSON> said. "Everybody says don't go unless you absolutely have to." 
</P>
<P>
Holtz already has instructed team managers to play the song, "Rocky Top," a 
<LOCATION>Tennessee</LOCATION> band favorite, during each of the <LOCATION>Notre Dame</LOCATION> practices this week. For 
two hours, the song is played again and again. Notre Dame players leave the 
workouts humming the tune. "I went to sleep <TIME>last night</TIME> and I could hear it," 
cornerback <PERSON>Todd Lyght</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
Said <PERSON>Holtz</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Notre Dame</ORGANIZATION>'s No. 1 ranking: "I have never worried about No. 1. We 
have a chance to be No. 1. But there are 10-15 teams who have a better chance 
to be No. 1." 
</P>
<P>
Grace Tower is the tallest dormitory on the campus at <LOCATION>South Bend</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ind</LOCATION>. Whenever 
the Irish are first in the polls, a No. 1 sign is placed atop the building. 
Holtz suggested that the person in charge of hanging the sign might want to 
keep his tools handy. 
</P>
<P>
"That guy's upset," <PERSON>Holtz</PERSON> said. "He knows he might have to go up there in bad 
weather and take it down." 
</P>
<P>
Our top 10: (1) <LOCATION>Notre Dame</LOCATION>, (2) <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION>, (3) <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, (4) <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION>, (5) BYU, 
(6) <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>, (7) <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>, (8) <LOCATION>Tennessee</LOCATION>, (9) <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, (10) <ORGANIZATION>Georgia Tech</ORGANIZATION>.

KTLA GARNERS MOST VIEWERS FOR COVERAGE OF ROSE PARADE

<P>
While the usual mob of early-rising revelers lined the streets of <LOCATION>Pasadena</LOCATION>, the 
101st Tournament of Roses Parade was also being watched on television in more 
than <MONEY>2 million</MONEY> <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION> homes. 
</P>
<P>
Between 8 and <TIME>10:30 a.m.</TIME>, <PERCENT>83%</PERCENT> of all the TV sets that were in use in the <LOCATION>Los 
Angeles</LOCATION> market were tuned to one of the five stations that aired this year's 
assortment of floats, flowers, celebrities and marching bands. 
</P>
<P>
As in the past, KTLA Channel 5, with its team of <PERSON>Bob Eubanks</PERSON> and <PERSON>Stephanie 
Edwards</PERSON> and its promise of never leaving the parade for commercials, grabbed 
the bulk of the viewing audience. KTLA had 1.1 million households -- more than 
the other four stations combined. 
</P>
<P>
KTTV Channel 11 was a distant second with about 419,000 homes. The three 
network-owned stations, which broadcast the parade with repeated commercial 
breaks to the entire nation, were far behind in the local race. KCBS Channel 2 
attracted about 192,000 homes, while KNBC Channel 4 and KABC Channel 7 drew 
about 143,000 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
On the football front, with <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION> shooting for its first bowl win in five years, 
the Rose Bowl on <ORGANIZATION>KABC</ORGANIZATION> was far and away the most watched game of the day in <LOCATION>Los 
Angeles</LOCATION>. The Trojans' 17-10 victory over the <ORGANIZATION>University of Michigan</ORGANIZATION> garnered a 
23.1 local rating, meaning it was seen in more than 1.1 million homes. 
</P>
<P>
Other New Year's Day local Bowl ratings (with each point representing 49,315 
homes): 
</P>
<P>
* Orange Bowl: <LOCATION>Notre Dame vs. Colorado</LOCATION>, KNBC: 18.3. 
</P>
<P>
* Sugar Bowl: <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> vs. <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION>, KABC: 8.9. 
</P>
<P>
* <PERSON>Hall</PERSON> of Fame: <ORGANIZATION>Auburn vs. Ohio St.</ORGANIZATION>, KNBC: 8. 
</P>
<P>
* Cotton Bowl: <LOCATION>Tennessee</LOCATION> vs. <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION>, KCBS: 6. 
</P>
<P>
* Fiesta Bowl: <LOCATION>Florida St. vs. Nebraska</LOCATION>, KNBC: 4.5.

<TEXT>
   NBC's ``The Cosby Show'' and ``Cheers'' tied
for first place in the ratings in a holiday week in which none of
the post-season football bowl games made the <ORGANIZATION>Nielsen Top</ORGANIZATION> 10.
   ABC's ``Roseanne'' was third and <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION>' ``60 Minutes'' and
``Murder, She Wrote'' were back near the top as the ratings began
to return to normal.
   Football dominated the ratings during the previous week. This
ratings period the top-ranked game was <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION>'s coverage of <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION>
and <LOCATION>Notre Dame</LOCATION> in the Orange Bowl. It tied for 12th place.
   The spill over into prime time of <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION>'s coverage of the <ORGANIZATION>AFL</ORGANIZATION>
professional playoff between <LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION> got a higher
rating, but was not included on the official <PERSON>Nielsen</PERSON> list. <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION> and
<ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION> put it in 12th place in their version of the list and the
Orange Bowl tied for 13th. ABC did not count the pro game in its
list.
   CBS' ``Designing Women,'' which had a one-hour special episode
with guest star <PERSON>Dolly Parton</PERSON> and the birth of <LOCATION>Charlene</LOCATION>'s baby, was
No. 10.
   <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION> won the <ORGANIZATION>A.C. Nielsen Co.</ORGANIZATION> ratings for the week ended <DATE>Jan. 7</DATE>
by a wide margin and <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION> took over second place again from <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION>. The
network averages: NBC 15.8, CBS 13.4, ABC 12.1. A ratings point
represents the percentage of the nation's 92.1 million television
homes tuned to a show.
   For the season to date, <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION> leads with an average of 14.8. ABC
is second with 12.9 and <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION> is third with 12.2.
   Here's the Top 10: <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION>'s ``The Cosby Show'' and ``Cheers'' tied,
<ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION>'s ``Roseanne,'' <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION>'s ``The Golden Girls,'' <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION>' ``60
Minutes,'' <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION>'s ``A Different World,'' <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION>' ``Murder, She Wrote,''
<ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION>'s ``Empty Nest'' and <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION>'s ``Wonder Years'' tied, <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION>'
``Designing Women.''
   CBS' ``Murder in Black and White,'' the third movie with <PERSON>Richard
Crenna</PERSON> in the same role as a <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> police detective, was 20th.
Its <DATE>Sunday</DATE> competition, the <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION> miniseries ``Drug Wars: The
Camarena Story'' did not do nearly as well. The opening episode of
the three-part show was in a three-way tie for 34th.
   Two new series had premieres last week. ABC's ``Father Dowling
Mysteries'' was 46th and <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION>' ``<PERSON>Max Monroe</PERSON>: Loose Cannon'' was 58th.
   Here's how the other bowl games fared: <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION>'s Rose Bowl tied for
28th, <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION>'s Fiesta Bowl 61st and <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION>'s Sugar Bowl 75th.
   <ORGANIZATION>Fox Broadcasting Co.</ORGANIZATION>'s ``Married ... With Children'' tied for
43rd place.
   CBS took first place among the <TIME>evening</TIME> news shows away from <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION>
for the week. ABC fell to second place by a tenth of a point. ``The
<ORGANIZATION>CBS Evening News</ORGANIZATION>'' was on five days <DATE>last week</DATE>, while <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION>
did not have <DATE>Monday</DATE> shows. The ratings: CBS 12.0, <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION> 11.9, <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION>
11.0.
   The lowest-rated show was <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION>'s ``Mission: Impossible.'' Here
are the five bottom network shows: <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION>'s ``<DATE>Saturday</DATE> Night With
<PERSON>Connie Chung</PERSON>,'' <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION>'s ``Life Goes On,'' <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION>' ``Tour of Duty,''
<ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION>'s Sugar Bowl, <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION>'s ``Mission: Impossible.''

There is still a chance that <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION> will play in a bowl game.

<P>
The Pacific 10 Conference has informed <ORGANIZATION>UCLA Athletic</ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON>Peter Dalis</PERSON> that 
there might be an opening in the <DATE>Dec. 27</DATE> Liberty Bowl at <LOCATION>Memphis</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Tenn</LOCATION>.

VIRGINIA HAS SCHEDULE OF A CHAMPION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<DATELINE>

CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Of the remaining undefeated teams with a chance at the national championship 
(sorry <ORGANIZATION>Fresno State</ORGANIZATION>), it appears that <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> has the easiest path to an 11-0 
season. 
</P>
<P>
The Cavaliers are no sure thing, but compared to unbeaten <LOCATION>Notre Dame</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Florida 
State</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Tennessee</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Auburn</LOCATION>, they have the most accommodating 
schedule. Incidentally, <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> are not included in this 
list of undefeated teams because they aren't eligible to compete in bowls this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Now then, consider each team's most difficult remaining opponents: 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>NOTRE DAME</LOCATION> -- <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Tennessee</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION>. Three of the 
five games are on the road. 
</P>
<P>
FLORIDA STATE -- <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Auburn</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Louisiana State</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>. The <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> and 
Auburn games are on the road. 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>NEBRASKA</LOCATION> -- The Cornhuskers still have to play <LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION> at <LOCATION>Norman</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Okla.</LOCATION>, and 
<LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
TENNESSEE -- <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Notre Dame</LOCATION>. All three games are at home, but 
the Gators are tough; <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION> is <LOCATION>Tennessee</LOCATION>'s fiercest rival, and <ORGANIZATION>Notre Dame</ORGANIZATION> is 
<LOCATION>Notre Dame</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
AUBURN -- <ORGANIZATION>Florida State</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION>. If the Tigers can get 
past <ORGANIZATION>Florida State</ORGANIZATION>, they still have the Gators, at <LOCATION>Gainesville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>VIRGINIA</LOCATION> -- <ORGANIZATION>North Carolina State</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Georgia Tech</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Maryland</LOCATION>. Not exactly 
murderer's row, is it? All three are home games, which doesn't make them 
gimmes, but . . . Fast-improving <ORGANIZATION>Georgia Tech</ORGANIZATION> could be a problem. 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION>'s rise to No. 4 in the <ORGANIZATION>Associated Press</ORGANIZATION> poll is important to the 
Cavaliers for two reasons: 
</P>
<P>
 -- It's the highest football ranking in the school's history. 
</P>
<P>
 -- It could change the entire bowl picture. Here's why: 
</P>
<P>
When the <ORGANIZATION>Atlantic Coast Conference</ORGANIZATION>, of which <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> is a member, signed a 
four-year contract with the <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> Citrus Bowl in the <DATE>summer of 1988</DATE>, a 
stipulation was included in the agreement. It read that in the first and third 
years of the contract, the <ORGANIZATION>ACC</ORGANIZATION> champion was committed to the Citrus Bowl and 
vice versa. In the second and fourth years, the Citrus Bowl has the option of 
inviting the <ORGANIZATION>ACC</ORGANIZATION> champion or another team. This is year No. 3. 
</P>
<P>
But -- and this is where it gets interesting -- a national championship 
contingency exists. The Citrus Bowl can opt out of the agreement if it can 
match the No. 1-ranked team against No. 2, 3 or 4. Likewise, the <ORGANIZATION>ACC</ORGANIZATION> champion 
-- and let's say it's <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> -- can opt out of the deal if its ranked no 
lower than fourth and can play the No. 1 team for the national title. 
</P>
<P>
One catch: The ACC champion can leave the Citrus only for the Sugar Bowl, 
Cotton Bowl or Orange Bowl. That's because the Citrus has no chance at the 
<ORGANIZATION>Southeastern Conference</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Southwest Conference</ORGANIZATION> or Big Eight champions, all of 
which are tied to the aforementioned three bowls. 
</P>
<P>
The Fiesta Bowl is off-limits because the Citrus considers it direct 
competition. The Fiesta has no conference tie-ins. 
</P>
<P>
"If all the bowls would have a similar agreement, we'd have a national 
championship game every year," said <PERSON>Chuck Rohe</PERSON>, executive director of the 
Citrus Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Not so fast. The Citrus Bowl will pay a projected <MONEY>$1.35 million</MONEY> to <MONEY>$1.5 million</MONEY> 
to its teams this year, which is considerably less than what a school could 
expect to earn by playing in, say, the Sugar Bowl, Cotton Bowl or Orange Bowl. 
According to <ORGANIZATION>Rohe</ORGANIZATION>, if the Citrus has a chance at keeping <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> for a 
national title contest, they would ask <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION>, which is broadcasting the New 
Year's Day game, to increase the rights fee. ABC isn't under any obligation to 
do so, but you can bet it would if a championship game -- and championship 
ratings -- were available. 
</P>
<P>
No one really expected <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> to be able to strike a deal with the <ORGANIZATION>NCAA's 
Committee on Infractions</ORGANIZATION>, did they? The Gators basically wanted to devise their 
own punishment for past rules violations. Fat chance. 
</P>
<P>
Recent NCAA sanctions against <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, 4-0 this season, prohibit a bowl 
appearance after the <DATE>1990</DATE> season. Outraged Gator officials wanted to trade 12 
football scholarships for the chance to accept a bowl bid and bowl money. The 
committee heard <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>'s appeal <DATE>last weekend</DATE>, but wasn't swayed. "(A 
university) can ask the <ORGANIZATION>Committee</ORGANIZATION> on Infractions whatever it wants to," the 
<ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>David Berst</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
Berst agreed the request was unusual. Not since <DATE>1952</DATE> has the <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> removed an 
announced penalty. 
</P>
<P>
There is one solution to <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>'s problem: Don't cheat. 
</P>
<P>
How seriously do they take their football at <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION>? When the <ORGANIZATION>Crimson Tide</ORGANIZATION> 
lost its first three games of the season, radio disc jockeys in <LOCATION>Birmingham</LOCATION>, 
<LOCATION>Ala.</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Tuscaloosa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ala.</LOCATION>, began giving air time to "Dig Him Up," an awful 
ballad about retrieving the legendary <PERSON>Bear Bryant</PERSON> from his coffin. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody, especially new and beleaguered <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION> Coach <PERSON>Gene Stallings</PERSON>, deserves 
that sort of misguided abuse. 
</P>
<P>
And those sightings of <ORGANIZATION>Danny Ford</ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION> can be disregarded. Stallings is 
safe. <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION>, a former Crimson Tide player who was forced out as <ORGANIZATION>Clemson</ORGANIZATION>'s coach, 
is a welcome visitor, said <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION> Athletic Director <PERSON>Hootie Ingram</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
The coach who should be worrying is <ORGANIZATION>Mississippi State</ORGANIZATION>'s Rocky Felker. Ford has 
been mentioned as a possible replacement for that struggling program. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Pat Dye</PERSON>'s decision to play for a tie against <LOCATION>Tennessee</LOCATION> continues to receive 
mixed reviews. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta Constitution columnist <PERSON>Steve Hummer</PERSON> listed a few of <ORGANIZATION>Dye</ORGANIZATION>'s favorite 
things. Favorite food: Thai. Favorite storm: typhoon. Favorite cowboy lyric: 
"Yippie Tie Yie Yay." Favorite player: <PERSON>Ty Detmer</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION>Tennessee Coach Johnny Majors</ORGANIZATION> agreed with the <ORGANIZATION>Auburn</ORGANIZATION> coach's move. 
And for what it's worth, so did <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>George Welsh</PERSON>.

Not surprisingly, the Citrus Bowl is pushing for an extension.

Contrary to published reports, the Orange Bowl will not automatically follow

It can't, mainly because the bowl's contract with the <ORGANIZATION>Big Eight</ORGANIZATION> runs through

A RICH TRADITION; COLORADO VS. STANFORD STANFORD STADIUM 12:30 P.M. SATURDAY;
Stanford football dates back to 1891, when the school played its first game
against Hopkins Academy. The first Big Game against Cal came the next year,
when Stanford prevailed 14-10. In the ensuing years, there have been 53
All-America players, 15 bowl games, including 11 Rose Bowl appearances, and
one Heisman Trophy. The school's football team has been led by such legendary
coaches as Pop Warner, Walter Camp and Bill Walsh and its games have included
such big upsets as last year's shocker over Notre Dame and wild finishes as
the five-lateral defeat against Cal in 1982. (color); PHOTO: Albert; PHOTO:

<TEXT>  Heisenberg when asked about; <ORGANIZATION>Stanford University.</ORGANIZATION>; When <ORGANIZATION>Stanford University</ORGANIZATION>
fielded its first football team in <DATE>1891</DATE>, football on the <LOCATION>West Coast</LOCATION> was still
in its infancy.;   The spirit of college football is said to have started in
the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION>, but the game being played was very different from the eastern
version, both in rules and caliber. The game played out West was described as
a crude form of rugby.;   The transition that followed is considered the birth
of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> football on the <LOCATION>West Coast</LOCATION>. If so, then <ORGANIZATION>Stanford</ORGANIZATION>, boasting some of the
most famous and innovative names in college football, may be considered its
home.;   <DATE>Today</DATE>, after 53 All-America players, 15 bowl games, including 11 Rose
Bowl appearances, one Heisman Trophy award winner, and participant in one of
college football's greatest rivalries, <ORGANIZATION>Stanford</ORGANIZATION> is celebrating its 100th
football anniversary.;   During that time, <ORGANIZATION>Stanford</ORGANIZATION> has a compiled a record of
552-337-51. Stanford did not play football from <DATE>1943</DATE> to <DATE>1945</DATE> because of World
War II.;   Currently, there are 12 Cardinal players on <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> rosters. The list
includes <ORGANIZATION>Denver Broncos</ORGANIZATION> quarterback <PERSON>John Elway</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> Bills wide receiver
<PERSON>James Lofton</PERSON>, and <ORGANIZATION>Chicago Bears</ORGANIZATION> running back <PERSON>Brad Muster.</PERSON>;   "We try to make
people aware, particularly the players, of the pride that goes along with
wearing the Stanford uniform," said <PERSON>Denny Green</PERSON>, in his third year as coach of
the <ORGANIZATION>Cardinal</ORGANIZATION>. "Right now we have possession of the <ORGANIZATION>Legends Trophy</ORGANIZATION>, which
started in <DATE>1925</DATE> for the first time <ORGANIZATION>Stanford</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Notre Dame</LOCATION> met.;   "Pop <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION>
was coaching for <ORGANIZATION>Stanford</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Knute Rockne</ORGANIZATION> was coaching for <ORGANIZATION>Notre Dame</ORGANIZATION>. I
don't think you could have any two more legendary coaches meet on the football
field.";   Some of the most innovative minds of the game coached at <ORGANIZATION>Stanford</ORGANIZATION>,
including <PERSON>Walter Camp</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Clark Shaughnessy</PERSON>, <PERSON>Chuck Taylor</PERSON> and Bill
Walsh.;   Camp, known as the "Father of American Football" and the first coach
at <ORGANIZATION>Stanford</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1892</DATE>, helped change the style of the game from rugby to
football.;   As a member of the <ORGANIZATION>Intercollegiate Rules Committee</ORGANIZATION>, Camp created
the line of scrimmage, 11-man team, signal calling, and the quarterback
position.;   He compiled a 12-3-3 record at <ORGANIZATION>Stanford</ORGANIZATION> before returning to coach
his alma mater, Yale.;   <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION>, who coached at <ORGANIZATION>Stanford</ORGANIZATION> from <DATE>1924</DATE> to <DATE>1932</DATE> and
compiled a 81-17 record, was credited by football historians with numerous
inventions, including the single- and double-wing offensive attacks, the
reverse play, huddles between plays and headgear.;    Also, two Cardinal
coaches were named the national coach of the year. Shaughnessy, whose Vow
Boys, led by <ORGANIZATION>All-America</ORGANIZATION> quarterback <PERSON>Frankie Albert</PERSON>, confused opposing
defenses with his T-formation and man-in-motion schemes, received the honor in
<DATE>1940.</DATE>;   <PERSON>Taylor</PERSON>, the only man in college football history to go to the Rose
Bowl as a player (<DATE>1941</DATE>), coach (<DATE>1952</DATE>) and athletic director (1971-72), all at
the same school, was selected in <DATE>1951.</DATE>;   <ORGANIZATION>Stanford</ORGANIZATION>, which changed its nickname
to Cardinal from the Indians in <DATE>1972</DATE>, has also had several legendary games.
Some jubilant wins, some narrow defeats.;   Among the great victories are
back-to-Rose Bowl upsets over <ORGANIZATION>Ohio State</ORGANIZATION> (27-17) and <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> (13-12) in <DATE>1971</DATE>
and <DATE>1972</DATE>. In <DATE>1970</DATE>, <PERSON>Jim Plunkett</PERSON> was awarded the <ORGANIZATION>Heisman Trophy</ORGANIZATION>, the only one
in the school's history.;   In the <DATE>1974</DATE> and <DATE>1990</DATE> Big Games with <LOCATION>Cal</LOCATION>, were both
won by the Cardinal (22-20 and 27-25) on last-play field goals by <PERSON>Mike
Langford</PERSON> and <PERSON>John Hopkins</PERSON>, respectively.;   Then, there was last year's 36-31
upset win over <LOCATION>Notre Dame.</LOCATION>;   "That was one of the great wins in Stanford
history," said <ORGANIZATION>Green</ORGANIZATION>. "Playing at home and ranked No. 1, they had not lost in
a situation like that since <DATE>1954</DATE>.";   Ironically, some of <ORGANIZATION>Stanford</ORGANIZATION>'s most
bitter losses have been to <LOCATION>Cal.</LOCATION>;   <ORGANIZATION>Stanford</ORGANIZATION> suffered close losses in the <DATE>1958</DATE>
(16-15) and <DATE>1959</DATE> (20-17) Big Games. In the <DATE>1959</DATE> game, <ORGANIZATION>Cardinal</ORGANIZATION> quarterback
<PERSON>Dick Norman</PERSON> had an incredible performance, completing 34 of 39 passes for 401
yards.;   "He (<PERSON>Norman</PERSON>) put on one of hell of an offensive display," said <PERSON>Chris
Burford</PERSON>, a Stanford All-American from 1957-59, who played in both games. "We
lost both games, but they were probably two of the greatest games we played
against each other.";   The most memorable, however, was the <DATE>1982</DATE> Big Game
which featured one of the wildest finishes in college football history.;   <LOCATION>Cal</LOCATION>
defeated Stanford 25-20 on a game ending 57-yard kickoff return seemingly
stolen from a rugby playbook.;   It featured five laterals, started by <ORGANIZATION>Cal</ORGANIZATION>'s
<PERSON>Kevin Moen</PERSON> and eventually ended with <PERSON>Moen</PERSON> taking it over the goal-line as the
<ORGANIZATION>Stanford</ORGANIZATION> band ran interference.; Magic moments; Here are some highlights in
Stanford football history.; (box)First team in <DATE>1891</DATE> went 3-1 without a coach.;
(box)The first game against <LOCATION>Cal</LOCATION> in <DATE>1892</DATE> ended in a 14-10 victory.;

THE BLOOM IS OFF THE ROSE PARADE; 
</P>
<P>
NEW YEAR'S: ORGANIZERS AND PROMOTERS HAVE SEVERAL THEORIES TO EXPLAIN LOWER 
ENTHUSIASM FOR THIS YEAR'S PROCESSION AND FOOTBALL GAME.

<P>
With only four days to go before <LOCATION>Pasadena</LOCATION>'s 101st Tournament of Roses Parade, 
officials say thousands of parade tickets remain unsold and that tickets to the 
Rose Bowl game have not gone as quickly as in previous years. 
</P>
<P>
Held back by earthquake jitters, bored over a second USC-Michigan match-up and 
sated by last year's 100th anniversary blow-out, many fans have been slow this 
year to flock to <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION>'s premier New Year's Day procession and 
football game. 
</P>
<P>
A few thousand unsold seats line the 5 1/2-mile parade route, said <PERSON>Sindee 
Anderson</PERSON>, general manager of <ORGANIZATION>Sharp Seating Co.</ORGANIZATION>, which puts up 100,000 
grandstand seats. 
</P>
<P>
In a normal year, only a handful would remain by this point, <PERSON>Anderson</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
The head of a tour company that takes senior citizens to the parade and the 
Rose Bowl game estimated that the number of his visitors is down by half this 
year. "One group from <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> that usually brings 250 interested only 35 this 
year," said <ORGANIZATION>Bud Johnsen of Special Events Services</ORGANIZATION>. "Instead of three bus loads 
from <LOCATION>Amarillo</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Tex.</LOCATION>, I've got a bus and a half." 
</P>
<P>
Even <LOCATION>Pasadena</LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON>William Thomson</PERSON> found an unresponsive market for the 100 
Rose Bowl tickets that he distributed at face value, <MONEY>$42</MONEY> apiece, for the 
USC-Michigan match up. "Up until (<ORGANIZATION>University of Michigan Coach</ORGANIZATION>) <PERSON>Bo Schembechler</PERSON> 
announced his retirement, there was not much of a demand for tickets," he said. 
</P>
<P>
With hundreds of thousands of people expected to line the parade route and more 
than 100,000 expected to jam themselves into the <LOCATION>Rose Bowl</LOCATION>, it's not as if no 
one is coming to <LOCATION>Pasadena</LOCATION>'s party. But city and parade officials, as well as 
those who make their livings from the parade, are used to a higher level of 
enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
They have different theories about why there isn't more excitement this year. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's the earthquake," <PERSON>Anderson</PERSON> said. The 7.1-magnitude temblor in 
<LOCATION>Northern California</LOCATION> on <DATE>Oct. 17</DATE> caused widespread damage and spawned tabloid 
predictions that <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> will fall into the ocean by <DATE>Dec. 31</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
East Coast customers have mentioned those accounts when they canceled tickets, 
<PERSON>Anderson</PERSON> said. "Most of us Californians are not worried about the shaking," she 
said. "I know one tour operator who is telling them, 'You have to love 
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION> with all its faults.' " 
</P>
<P>
Johnsen believes that the parade's 100th anniversary celebration in <DATE>1989</DATE> 
undercut enthusiasm for the <DATE>1990</DATE> parade. "The Tournament of Roses Assn. 
oversold the 100th anniversary," he said. "If you were coming from out of 
state, you went last year. It's easing down a little this year." 
</P>
<P>
But <PERSON>Jay Brooks</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Al Brooks Rose Bowl Tours</ORGANIZATION> believes that domestic travel is 
down in general and the lagging Rose Parade business simply reflects an 
industrywide trend. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the idea that the same two college teams are playing for the second 
year in a row at the <LOCATION>Rose Bowl</LOCATION> has not helped. "People said, 'Oh gee, <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> 
and <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION> again, what's new?' " <ORGANIZATION>Thomson</ORGANIZATION> said. 
</P>
<P>
But after <PERSON>Schembechler</PERSON>, the 21-year <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> coach and veteran of eight 
previous Rose Bowls, announced his retirement in <DATE>mid-December</DATE>, demand did heat 
up for game tickets. 
</P>
<P>
Most people trying to buy game tickets will now have to pay between <MONEY>$75</MONEY> and 
<MONEY>$250</MONEY> to ticket agencies, which buy their tickets from the public and the 
colleges. The <MONEY>$42</MONEY> face-value tickets have all been accounted for, according to 
<PERSON>Jack French</PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION>Tournament of Roses Assn</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Under the tournament's ticket distribution system with the <ORGANIZATION>National Collegiate 
Athletic Assn.</ORGANIZATION>, the PAC 10 schools receive 52,000 tickets, the Big 10 gets 
23,000 and the tournament association receives 25,000. 
</P>
<P>
Of the tournament tickets, about 10,000 are allocated to the 1,400 tournament 
association members, whose entitlements are based on seniority. Another 7,000 
tickets are purchased by float sponsors, 3,500 are set aside for a lottery for 
the general public, 1,200 are sold to the city of <LOCATION>Pasadena</LOCATION> and the rest are 
used for promotion. 
</P>
<P>
City employees receive about 400 of the city tickets. The employees are 
selected to buy <MONEY>$42</MONEY> tickets by department heads in drawings or by other methods 
devised by supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
"We use them basically to do P.R. for the city and promote the name of the 
city," said <PERSON>Ed Aghjayan</PERSON>, assistant city manager of <LOCATION>Pasadena</LOCATION>. For example, 
tickets are sold at face value to members of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>, mayors and school 
officials throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the <ORGANIZATION>Board of Directors</ORGANIZATION>, the city's seven-member council that 
includes the mayor, also receive 100 tickets each. The directors sell their <MONEY>$42</MONEY> 
tickets to campaign supporters, family members, neighborhood organizations and 
residents within their districts. 
</P>
<P>
The board's ticket giveaway was criticized in <DATE>1987</DATE>, when the Super Bowl was 
played at the Rose Bowl. After allegations of cronyism and favoritism were 
leveled against them, directors passed rules tightening ticket distribution. A 
list of people receiving tickets must be kept, and recipients must pledge not 
to resell them -- a pledge board members say is nearly impossible to enforce. 
</P>
<P>
Among those receiving tickets at face value this year is <PERSON>Billy Hinsdale</PERSON>, a 
14-year-old newspaper carrier from <LOCATION>Saratoga</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif</LOCATION>. Billy wrote the city's 
mayor in <DATE>November</DATE>, saying he would save money from his newspaper route to buy 
tickets for his mother, father and sister <PERSON>Kathryn</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been a good person for most of my life," <PERSON>Billy</PERSON> wrote. "I get good grades 
and stay out of trouble."

IT'S MORE THAN A CONSOLATION GAME; 
</P>
<P>
FREEDOM BOWL: OREGON AND COLORADO STATE, UNLIKE PARTICIPANTS IN PAST YEARS, ARE 
GLAD TO BE IN ANAHEIM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
After several years of serving a bowl of holiday leftovers, this year the 
Freedom Bowl offers something different. So what if <LOCATION>Oregon</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Colorado State</ORGANIZATION> 
aren't haute cuisine? At least these teams aren't the warmed-over remnants of 
seasons gone bad. 
</P>
<P>
No more teams such as <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, which sold only 1,200 tickets before slogging 
through the final comedown of a disappointing season in last year's game. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, <LOCATION>Oregon</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Colorado State</ORGANIZATION> are happy to be here, as both coaches and any 
third-string free safety seemed pleased to say this week, prompted or not. 
</P>
<P>
Oregon is making its bid for respectability by playing in consecutive bowl 
games for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
"Coming from the <ORGANIZATION>University of Oregon</ORGANIZATION>, it feels like back-to-back Super Bowls," 
said <PERSON>Michael McClellan</PERSON>, a senior flanker. 
</P>
<P>
The Ducks have built their 8-3 record on the arm of <PERSON>Bill Musgrave</PERSON>, who was the 
All-Pacific 10 quarterback, despite the attention devoted to others. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Colorado State</ORGANIZATION> is positively giddy over its first bowl game in 42 years, 
getting a sequel, at long last, to its <DATE>1949</DATE> Raisin Bowl appearance. It has 
taken only two years for <PERSON>Earle Bruce</PERSON>, the former <ORGANIZATION>Ohio State</ORGANIZATION> coach, to bring the 
Rams from 1-10 to 8-4. 
</P>
<P>
Is this game a comedown for a man who took the Buckeyes to two Rose Bowl games? 
Bruce, his ability proved once again, just smiles. 
</P>
<P>
"I've also been in the <LOCATION>Peach</LOCATION>, the Liberty, the <PERSON>Hall</PERSON> of Fame, the Fiesta," <PERSON>Bruce</PERSON> 
said. "I've been to the Citrus Bowl and the Tangerine. I can't say I haven't 
had all the experiences. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't feel any different. I think it's different for the kids. I've never 
coached a more appreciative football team than this. Sometimes in other 
programs, they don't appreciate it. They have been so receptive and worked so 
hard. We're not the most talented football team, but we have some talent." 
</P>
<P>
All this good feeling came by design, not happenstance, said <PERSON>Don Andersen</PERSON>, the 
game's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt it was important to have teams here that were anxious to be here," 
<PERSON>Andersen</PERSON> said, calling it "the game plan" to get teams from the Pac-10 and the 
<ORGANIZATION>Western Athletic Conference</ORGANIZATION>. "We didn't even go to the Big Ten, the <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Notre 
Dame</LOCATION>. We took a very practical approach." 
</P>
<P>
Oregon is favored in this match, billed as a battle between the <ORGANIZATION>Ducks</ORGANIZATION>' passing 
offense, in which <PERSON>Musgrave</PERSON> has averaged 222 yards a game, and <ORGANIZATION>Colorado State</ORGANIZATION>'s 
multiple-formation ground game. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Oregon Coach Rich Brooks</ORGANIZATION> is encouraged that his offense will be stronger than 
it was in the final two games, when an injury-depleted unit failed to score a 
touchdown while losing to <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, 28-3, and defeating <ORGANIZATION>Oregon State</ORGANIZATION>, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Musgrave</PERSON> has had time to recover from several injuries, the most recent of 
which kept him out of the last six quarters of the regular season with a bruise 
in his throwing shoulder. Two receivers are back after undergoing arthroscopic 
knee surgery, <PERSON>McClellan</PERSON> and <PERSON>Joe Reitzug</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, tailback <PERSON>Sean Burwell</PERSON>, a redshirt freshman who led the team with 949 
yards rushing after being forced into action because of an early-season injury 
to the starter, is back after missing most of the <ORGANIZATION>Oregon State</ORGANIZATION> game because of 
a back injury. 
</P>
<P>
"They're all healthy," <PERSON>Brooks</PERSON> said. "It makes me feel a little better about our 
chances on the offensive side since we struggled so much in the last two games 
of the year." 
</P>
<P>
The Ducks are not as sound on defense, where they lost senior <PERSON>Peter Brantley</PERSON>, 
an all-conference outside linebacker, because of a strained left knee suffered 
in practice last week in <LOCATION>Irvine</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Colorado State</ORGANIZATION> also has had time for an important player to heal. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Tony Alford</PERSON>, a tailback who ran for 1,035 yards last season, has been bothered 
by a right hamstring pull and later by a strained tendon in his right foot. He 
rushed for 647 yards, but started only one game. The bulk of the ground work 
went to <PERSON>Brian Copeland</PERSON> and <PERSON>Todd Yert</PERSON>, a short-yardage fullback who has put his 
head down and bulled to 16 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
"<PERSON>Alford</PERSON>, there's a guy who hasn't been well all year," <PERSON>Bruce</PERSON> said. "He's going 
to see the football quite a bit -- if we get the football quite a bit." 
</P>
<P>
Bruce keeps his own counsel as to which of two rotating quarterbacks he will 
start -- <PERSON>Mike Gimenez</PERSON>, the better option quarterback and the starter in the 
past five games, or <PERSON>Kevin Verdugo</PERSON>, the better passer, who was slowed by a 
shoulder injury late in the season. 
</P>
<P>
Known to surprise even his assistants with his choice of a starter, <PERSON>Bruce</PERSON> 
strayed from an earlier expectation that <PERSON>Gimenez</PERSON> would start and said <DATE>Friday</DATE>, 
"I think probably (it would be) <LOCATION>Verdugo</LOCATION>, if we had to start right now." 
</P>
<P>
Defensively, <ORGANIZATION>Colorado State</ORGANIZATION> lost a starter in the secondary this week when 
<PERSON>Harlan Carroll</PERSON> came down with what was diagnosed as mononucleosis. That will 
put added pressure on a defensive backfield secondary already facing a great 
deal of it.

"<PERSON>Musgrave</PERSON> throws the ball, and if you overdo (setting the defense for) that, 
they'll run the ball and put it in the end zone," <PERSON>Bruce</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
Oregon must be watchful of the curse of the favorite: overconfidence. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm obviously concerned that could be the case with our team," <PERSON>Brooks</PERSON> said. 
"There's no question <ORGANIZATION>Colorado State</ORGANIZATION> is challenged. <PERSON>Earle Bruce</PERSON> is challenged 
when he gets up in the <TIME>morning</TIME>. There's no question they'll be ready to play 
and come out and bloody our noses."

<ORGANIZATION>Colorado State Coach Earle Bruce</ORGANIZATION> was asked for his reaction to <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION>'s

a good question. I've been waiting for that one. . . . Great coaching job by 
(<ORGANIZATION>Air Force Coach</ORGANIZATION>) <PERSON>Fisher DeBerry</PERSON>. That was a great win for us as a conference,

UCLA PICKS APART ARKANSAS AND WINS SEVENTH STRAIGHT BOWL GAME

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
<PERSON>Troy Aikman</PERSON> was at the crossroads at <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> Stadium <DATE>Monday</DATE>, ending a fine 
collegiate career with the kind of passing that made his reputation at <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
And, if he is the <ORGANIZATION>Dallas Cowboys</ORGANIZATION>' No. 1 pick in next <DATE>April</DATE>'s <ORGANIZATION>National Football 
League</ORGANIZATION> draft as expected, the quarterback gave hopeful <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> fans some 
optimisim. 
</P>
<P>
Aikman's third-down efficiency confused <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION> on two long touchdown drives 
as the ninth-ranked Bruins set an <ORGANIZATION>National Collegiate Athletic Assn.</ORGANIZATION> record 
with their seventh consecutive bowl victory, beating the <LOCATION>Razorbacks</LOCATION>, 17-3, in 
the Cotton Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Aikman converted 12 of 20 third-down opportunities and threw a touchdown pass 
as the Bruins again showed their domination in postseason play. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA (10-2) broke a tie with <ORGANIZATION>Georgia Tech</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION> in 
claiming a spot in the record books with a seventh bowl victory. The Bruins' 
victory streak includes three <PERSON>Rose Bowls</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Fiesta</LOCATION>, an <LOCATION>Aloha</LOCATION> and a Freedom 
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Aikman overcame an early interception to direct the Bruins on touchdown drives 
of 93 and 74 yards as <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION> gained a 14-0 halftime edge over the Hogs, who had 
only two first downs at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Aikman converted 6 straight third-down plays before <PERSON>Mark Estwick</PERSON> scored on a 
1-yard run for a 6-0 Bruin lead after a scoreless first period. The extra-point 
kick made it 7-0. 
</P>
<P>
Late in the first half, <PERSON>Aikman</PERSON> took <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION> on a beat-the-clock drive in which he 
fooled <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION> (10-2) for the second touchdown. On third-and-goal from the 
Hogs' 1, he bootlegged the ball on a fake sweep then threw a touchdown pass to 
tight end <PERSON>Corwin Anthony</PERSON> with 21 seconds left for a 14-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Arkansas' <PERSON>Kendall Trainor</PERSON> kicked his 24th consecutive field goal, a 49-yarder, 
in the third period to keep the Hogs from a shutout. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA's only second half points came on <PERSON>Alfredo Velasco</PERSON>'s 32-yard field goal in 
the fourth period. 
</P>
<P>
Aikman made excellent use of <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION>'s running game, handing off to freshman 
tailback <PERSON>Shawn Wills</PERSON> 18 times for 120 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Aikman was closely watched by members of the downtrodden <ORGANIZATION>Cowboys</ORGANIZATION>' organization, 
who are thinking about making him the first pick in the <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> draft. 
</P>
<P>
Dallas Coach <PERSON>Tom Landry</PERSON> watched on television but scout <PERSON>Gil Brandt</PERSON> was in the 
press box. 
</P>
<P>
Aikman finished his career at <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION> with a 20-4 record as a starter. He hit 19 
of 27 passes for 172 yards. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA's alert defense held <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION> to only four first downs, one by penalty. 
</P>
<P>
The clear, windless day was ideal for <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION>'s passing attack. It was the first 
appearance for a <LOCATION>West Coast</LOCATION> team in the Cotton Bowl since <LOCATION>Oregon</LOCATION> played 
Southern Methodist 40 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
A sellout crowd of 74,304 watched <PERSON>Aikman</PERSON> overcome early jitters, failing to see 
<LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION> linebacker <PERSON>LaSalle Harper</PERSON> at the Razorback 12. The interception ended 
a <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION> first-period drive that had reached the Hog 17 after an interception and 
20-yard return by <PERSON>Darryl Henley</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA's first touchdown drive was helped by a personal foul against <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION>' 
<PERSON>Otis Lloyd</PERSON> after <PERSON>Aikman</PERSON> had been stopped short on a third-down run. 
</P>
<P>
Aikman then completed a 10-yard pass to <PERSON>Reggie Moore</PERSON>, a 12-yard pass to <PERSON>Mike 
Farr</PERSON>, and a 9-yard pass to <PERSON>Brendan McCracken</PERSON>, all on third down, on the 93-yard 
scoring drive. 
</P>
<P>
The 74-yard scoring drive was aided by <PERSON>Aikman</PERSON>'s 20-yard third down pass to <PERSON>Paul 
Richardson</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
Aikman converted 8 of 12 third down opportunities in the first half. He also 
completed passes to 10 different receivers as he read the <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION> defense. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA lost another chance to score in the third period when <PERSON>Laurence Burkley</PERSON> 
fumbled at the <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION> 7 and <PERSON>Kerry Crawford</PERSON> recovered for the Hogs. 
</P>
<P>
It was only the second meeting between the schools. They tied, 10-10, in the 
<DATE>1978</DATE> Fiesta Bowl.

FIESTA BOWL HAD TV EDGE NATIONALLY, BUT ROSE BOWL WAS BIG WINNER IN L.A. 
</P>

Preliminary indications are that more television viewers nationally watched 
<DATE>Monday</DATE>'s <LOCATION>Fiesta Bowl</LOCATION>, in which No. 1 <LOCATION>Notre Dame</LOCATION> defeated No. 3 <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION>, 
34-21, than watched the <ORGANIZATION>Rose Bowl</ORGANIZATION>, in which <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> beat <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION>, 22-14. But the 
gap was not as large as many had expected, and in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, the Rose Bowl 
was a big winner. 
</P>
<P>
The Rose Bowl drew an average <PERSON>Nielsen</PERSON> rating of 26 in <LOCATION>L.A.</LOCATION>, compared to an 8.8 
for the <LOCATION>Fiesta</LOCATION>. The Rose Bowl started out with an 18.4 rating and peaked at a 
32 late in the game. The Fiesta peaked early at 13.1 and had only a 6.8 in the 
last quarter-hour. 
</P>
<P>
The Fiesta Bowl's average overnight rating for the nation's 17 largest markets 
was a 15; the Rose Bowl, which started a half-hour later, drew a 12.7 
</P>
<P>
Other overnight bowl ratings for the 17 major markets: Orange, 11.2; Cotton, 
10.2; Sugar, 7.6; <PERSON>Hall</PERSON> of Fame, 7.1, and <LOCATION>Florida Citrus</LOCATION>, 6.3. 
</P>
<P>
Final national ratings won't be available until later this week or early next 
week. <PERSON>LARRY STEWART</PERSON>

WIN MAKES RETIRING DUKE FEEL LIKE A KING

<PERSON>Wayne Duke</PERSON>, retiring commissioner of the <ORGANIZATION>Big Ten Conference</ORGANIZATION>, was brought to 
tears in the press box by <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>'s 22-14 victory over <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
As commissioner for the <DATE>last 18 years</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Duke</ORGANIZATION> has been an easy target for those 
who have criticized the <ORGANIZATION>Big Ten</ORGANIZATION>'s recent lack of success in the <LOCATION>Rose Bowl</LOCATION>. But 
now his conference has won its last two <LOCATION>Rose Bowls</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Michigan State</LOCATION> beating USC 
<DATE>last year</DATE>, and <ORGANIZATION>Duke</ORGANIZATION> couldn't have received a better retirement present. 
</P>
<P>
"Lots of people are shaking my hand," <PERSON>Duke</PERSON> said, "but you know what, I didn't 
throw one block or make one tackle." 
</P>
<P>
In the category of outdated jokes, there's this one that was making the rounds 
before the game: Why does <PERSON>Bo Schembechler</PERSON> eat his cereal off a plate? Because 
if he put it in a bowl, he'd lose it. 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writer <PERSON>Shav Glick</PERSON>, 68, who helped cover <DATE>Monday</DATE>'s Rose Bowl, saw his 
first Rose Bowl game 57 years ago, when <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION> beat <ORGANIZATION>Tulane</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1932</DATE>. After that 
game, <PERSON>Glick</PERSON> saw 20 of the next 21 games. 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> defensive tackle <PERSON>Mark Messner</PERSON>'s thoughts on playing against <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION>'s 
<PERSON>Aaron Emanuel</PERSON>: "I didn't like it much. I hit him square on one time, and the 
next thing I know, he was 4 yards downfield." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Messner</PERSON> said he missed <PERSON>Leroy Hoard</PERSON>'s 61-yard breakaway run for <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"We were all huddled around Coach <PERSON>Carr</PERSON>," <PERSON>Messner</PERSON> said, referring to <PERSON>Lloyd Carr</PERSON>, 
the defensive coordinator. "We're supposed to be concentrating on our huddle, 
so if we even stand up he gets a little mad. We heard the crowd go crazy, but 
nobody moved. We didn't get to see it at all." 
</P>
<P>
Messner's impression of playing against <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>John Guerrero</PERSON>, a 320-pound 
tackle: "They passed so much that it was hard to get a good idea of just how 
good he is. But he certainly is classy. He'd help you up, tell you you made a 
good play. 
</P>
<P>
"Matter of fact, the entire <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION> team was classy. Some teams, you are out there 
and there is lots of talking and bad-mouthing. There was none of that with 
<ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION>." 
</P>
<P>
When <PERSON>Rodney Peete</PERSON> turned a broken play into a 23-yard gain in the <DATE>second 
quarter</DATE>, it was the Trojan quarterback's longest run of the season -- by a 
yard. Peete wound up with 31 net yards in 5 carries and, like player of the 
game Hoard, 2 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
One of the few mistakes by <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> was a dropped pass by split end <PERSON>Greg 
McMurtry</PERSON> on the <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION> 15. Quarterback <PERSON>Demetrius Brown</PERSON> hurled the ball nearly 50 
yards in the air, a perfect strike, but it slipped through <PERSON>McMurtry</PERSON>'s hands for 
an error. 
</P>
<P>
Hopefully, no baseball scouts were in the Rose Bowl. McMurtry is such a hot 
baseball prospect that he was offered <MONEY>$172,000</MONEY> to sign out of high school by 
the <ORGANIZATION>Boston Red Sox</ORGANIZATION> after they made him their No. 1 draft choice. 
</P>
<P>
How's this for a firing technique? A Big Ten source said <DATE>Monday</DATE> that the 
<ORGANIZATION>University of Wisconsin</ORGANIZATION>'s football troubles may have very well started a year 
ago, when Athletic Director <PERSON>Elroy Hirsch</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>Crazy Legs of Rams</ORGANIZATION>' fame, was 
called into the office of the interim chancellor and told to sign a sheet of 
paper that was, in essence, his resignation. 
</P>
<P>
This season, <LOCATION>Wisconsin</LOCATION> went 1-10 in football and its once-proud attendance 
showing, always around the 70,000 average mark despite a series of weak teams, 
slipped below the 50,000 average mark.
