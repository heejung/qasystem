ERMA BOMBECK: SNAKES LEAVE HER A LITTLE RATTLED

<P>
This is the time of year in <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION> when people look where they're going and 
walk on the sunny side of the rocks. It's stinking hot and it's snake time. 
</P>
<P>
We hear relatively few stories about snakebites, but <PERSON>Peter Aleshire</PERSON> reported an 
incredible story in the <LOCATION>Arizona Republic</LOCATION> the other day: A man was bitten on the 
tongue while kissing a rattlesnake. 
</P>
<P>
Now here's the weird part. He decided to try a non-scientific, quack-type 
remedy he had heard about to counteract snakebite. A word of caution: Do not 
try this in your own home. He'd heard that if you run an electrical current 
through the wound, it is supposed to break down the venom. So, after he was 
bitten, he wired his mouth to a pickup battery and tried to jump-start his 
tongue. It knocked him out cold, and he ended up in the hospital where he lost 
part of his tongue and one lip. My views on snakes are well known. I do not for 
a single minute believe they're as afraid of me as I am of them. They are not 
trying to get out of my way when they see me coming, and people who keep them 
around to keep the rodent population down should be heavily sedated. 
</P>
<P>
When my husband and I first moved to this state, we were invited one night to 
the town of Prescott to witness a festival celebrating Indian lore. It featured 
a group of men with snakes tattooed on their arms who performed the famous 
"Smoki Snake Dance." Our host was a "Smoki." 
</P>
<P>
As a couple of dozen men danced around a circle to the beat of a tom-tom, each 
dancer was given a snake (non-poisonous). He was to clench the snake between 
his teeth closely behind the head and just out of striking distance while he 
held the tail in his hand and waved it around as he kept the beat. 
</P>
<P>
When the dance was over, we went down to the field to say good night to our 
host. There was blood streaming down his face as he said, "Shoot, I got bit 
last year. Next year, I've got to get a better grip on him closer to the head." 
</P>
<P>
When I asked him where all the snakes had gone, he looked around him on the 
ground and said, "We just release 'em when we're finished. They're probably 
halfway to the parking lot by this time." 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>University of Arizona Poison Control Center</ORGANIZATION> was quoted as saying that most 
snakebites come from people kissing snakes, playing with them and handling them 
on a routine basis. 
</P>
<P>
Do you see a personality profile developing here anywhere?

<HEAD>Man Found Guilty Of Manslaughter In Snakebite Death of Toddler</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. GEORGE, Utah (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man was convicted of manslaughter
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE> in the snakebite-death of a girl around whose shoulder he
had draped a rattlesnake.
   District <PERSON>Judge J. Philip Eves</PERSON> announced the verdict against
<PERSON>Darrell Wessendorf</PERSON> in the non-jury trial.
   Wessendorf, 24, had been charged with second-degree murder in
the death last year of 21-month-old <ORGANIZATION>Stevie LuRen Kirkwood of La
Verkin</ORGANIZATION>. He had pleaded innocent by reason of insanity.
   The judge said that he found Wessendorf guilty of the lesser
charge because the defendant hadn't been aware of the possible
results of his actions.
   Wessendord, who was renting an upstairs apartment from the
child's mother, <PERSON>Jeri Ann Kirkwood</PERSON>, at the time, testified that he
found the 5-foot rattlesnake on a road and was trying to show the
girl that that it would not hurt her.
   He said he had partially wrapped the snake around the child's
shoulder when <PERSON>Mrs. Kirkwood</PERSON> entered the room and screamed, causing
him to flinch and the snake to bite the child.
   Sentencing was set for <DATE>April 11</DATE>. Manslaughter carries a one- to
15-year sentence. Second-degree murder would have brought five
years to life.
   Defense attorney <PERSON>J. MacArthur Wright</PERSON> had claimed that only <PERCENT>0.2
percent</PERCENT> of those bitten by rattlesnakes die and called on the judge
to ``make a distinction here on what constitutes a grave risk of
death.''
   ``People bitten by rattlesnakes are often not even treated,'' he
said.
   Prosecutor <PERSON>O. Brent Rowe</PERSON> argued that <PERSON>Wessendorf</PERSON>'s actions were
intentional and malicious.
   Earlier <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, a psychologists, <PERSON>George Dunford</PERSON>, said that
Wessendorf suffered from mild schizophrenia and that he did not
believe the defendant understood he was endangering the child.
   An expert on snakes, <PERSON>James Glenn</PERSON>, testified for the defense that
the snake is one of the least aggressive types of rattlers and that
the hospital did not give the girl enough anti-venom.

<HEAD>Doctors Await Serum To Treat Snakebite Victim, But May Not Use It</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Physicians treating a snake-venom
researcher received a shipment of serum from <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> to counteract a
deadly viper bite <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, but a hospital spokesman said doctors
may elect not to use it.
   Antivenin was flown in <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME> for <PERSON>William E. Haast</PERSON>,
78, who remained in serious but stable condition at the <ORGANIZATION>University
of Utah Health Sciences Center</ORGANIZATION> after being bit on the left hand by a
Pakistani pit viper earlier in the week.
   ``The doctors are evaluating it,'' said <PERSON>John Dwan</PERSON>, hospital
spokesman. ``We're hopeful that it's not needed, but that remains to
be seen.''
   In an unusual effort initiated by <PERSON>Stephen Studdert</PERSON>, special
assistant to President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>, antivenins effective against the bite
were located in <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Customs
rules were waived to place the shipments quickly on flights to the
<LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>.
   The British shipment from the <ORGANIZATION>English National Poison Unit</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>London</LOCATION> arrived <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>. But doctors did not administer it to
<LOCATION>Haast</LOCATION>, deciding instead to wait for the more effective Iranian
serum, said nursing supervisor <PERSON>Rick Taylor</PERSON>.
   <PERSON>Studdert</PERSON> said the shipment from the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> was being
arranged through direct, government-to-government contacts, but in
<LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION>, ``people-to-people, non-government'' contacts were used. There
are no formal ties between the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION>'s
fundamentalist Moslem government, which has repeatedly referred to
<LOCATION>America</LOCATION> as the ``Great Satan.''
   Meanwhile, <PERSON>Haast</PERSON>'s fibrinogen level, an element in the blood that
regulates how the blood coagulates and is destroyed by the snake
bite venom, has been improving, although it remained far below
acceptable levels, according to hospital spokesman <PERSON>John Dwan</PERSON>.
   ``We have been replacing fibrinogen through transfusions and his
body appears to be making fibrinogen,'' <PERSON>Dwan</PERSON> said.
   The Iranian antivenin arrived at mid-afternoon and one of <LOCATION>Haast</LOCATION>'s
friends transported it to the hospital. Before it is used, <PERSON>Dwan</PERSON> said
doctors would monitor <PERSON>Haast</PERSON>'s condition and run checks on the
antivenin.
   ``These antivenins are not miracle cure-alls,'' he said. ``There
are negative side effects that we have to guard against.'' He said
antivenins, which are made from horse serum, can cause lung and
kidney problems.
   Haast had been treated earlier with antivenins from <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>'s
<LOCATION>San Diego Zoo</LOCATION> and from a lab in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, but <PERSON>Dwan</PERSON> said he had
not been given antivenins for about 24 hours.
   The supply of the serum from the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> was being sent from
the <ORGANIZATION>Tashkent Institute of Vaccines</ORGANIZATION>. That serum was being flown to
<LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION> and was expected to get to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> late <DATE>Sunday</DATE>.
   Haast, director of the <ORGANIZATION>Miami Serpentarium Laboratories</ORGANIZATION> at the
university's <ORGANIZATION>Research Park</ORGANIZATION>, has been bitten 148 times by snakes and
is immune to the venom of dozens of reptiles. But he had no immunity
to withstand the viper's bite and checked himself into the hospital
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE> after being bitten <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
   The Pakistani pit viper, or saw-scaled viper, is one of 1,000
exotic, poisonous snakes <LOCATION>Haast</LOCATION> keeps at the lab, where their venom
is extracted for sale to universities and health organizations for
use in research and the manufacture of antivenins.

<TEXT>
<P>
A new way to make effective snakebite anti-venom antidotes that have fewer side 
effects than existing products has been developed by researchers at the 
<ORGANIZATION>University of Wisconsin</ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION>Madison</ORGANIZATION>. About 45,000 people worldwide die each year 
from poisonous bites and stings, and many times that number are treated 
successfully. 
</P>
<P>
As many as <PERCENT>80%</PERCENT> of all patients treated with conventional anti-venoms develop 
allergic reactions to horse proteins in the anti-venoms. 
</P>
<P>
Molecular biologists <PERSON>Sean B. Carroll</PERSON> and <PERSON>Bruce Thalley</PERSON> report in today's 
edition of BioTechnology that they have made effective anti-venoms by injecting 
the poisons into chickens. The antibodies are concentrated in egg yolks, which 
makes isolation and purification easy. Chicken proteins also do not produce as 
severe a reaction as horse proteins. The anti-venoms have not yet been tested 
in humans.

   Physicians treating a snake-venom
researcher, whose need for rare medicine prompted <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION>
intervention, were awaiting a shipment of serum from <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> today to
counteract a deadly viper bite.
   In an unusual effort initiated by <PERSON>Stephen Studdert</PERSON>, special
assistant to President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>, antivenins effective against the bite
of a Pakistani pit viper were located in <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> and the
<LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Customs rules were waived to place the
shipments quickly on flights to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>.
   The antivenins were sought for <PERSON>William E. Haast</PERSON>, 78, who was in
serious but stable condition at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Utah Health
Sciences Center</ORGANIZATION> today after being bitten in the left hand by the
viper earlier in the week.
   The British shipment from the <ORGANIZATION>English National Poison Unit</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>London</LOCATION> arrived <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>. But doctors did not administer it to
<LOCATION>Haast</LOCATION>, deciding instead to wait for the more effective Iranian
serum, said nursing supervisor <PERSON>Rick Taylor</PERSON>.
   ``The one from <LOCATION>Tehran</LOCATION> is the best one, I understand, because of
its properties,'' <PERSON>Taylor</PERSON> said. ``We will not give the <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> one
unless <PERSON>Mr. Haast</PERSON>'s condition deteriorates.''
   Haast was being given plasma intermittently to replace
coagulating elements of his blood. The snake's venom prohibits blood
from coagulating and victims often bleed to death.
   Haast, director of the <ORGANIZATION>Miami Serpentarium Laboratories</ORGANIZATION> at the
university's <ORGANIZATION>Research Park</ORGANIZATION>, has been bitten 148 times by snakes and
is immune to the venom of dozens of reptiles. But he had no immunity
to withstand the viper's bite and checked himself into the hospital
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
   The Pakistani pit viper, or saw-scaled viper, is one of 1,000
exotic, poisonous snakes <LOCATION>Haast</LOCATION> keeps at the lab, where their venom
is extracted for sale to universities and health organizations for
use in research and the manufacture of antivenins.
   Haast had been treated earlier with antivenins from <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>'s
<LOCATION>San Diego Zoo</LOCATION>, including one shipment obtained through an unusual
airport relay involving zoo personnel, a helicopter and a departing
jetliner.
   Studdert of Salt <LOCATION>Lake City</LOCATION> said he became involved <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>
when he received a call from an associate of <ORGANIZATION>Haast's</ORGANIZATION>. The associate,
who had read accounts of a speech <PERSON>Studdert</PERSON> gave in <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION> describing
<PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s ``kinder, gentler'' approach to human problems, said the
serum could only be located in the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> and asked
for the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration's help.
   <PERSON>Studdert</PERSON> said he immediately set up conference calls with people
around the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and in other countries after doctors and
specialists advised the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> that the serums Haast needed
were unavailable in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>.
   Using an American interpreter who speaks <LOCATION>Farsi</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Studdert</PERSON> put
<LOCATION>Haast</LOCATION>'s representatives in telephone contact with serum specialists
in <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION>.
   Two different serums were needed, he said, one for young pit
vipers and another for older snakes of the same breed.
   Vials of the Iranian serum were due to arrive in <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION> <TIME>this
afternoon</TIME>.
   The serum found at the <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> institute was the antivenin used
for younger vipers.
   Another supply of the serum was obtained through the <ORGANIZATION>Tashkent
Institute of Vaccines</ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>. That serum was being
flown to <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION> for eventual shipment to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>.
   ``When I decided I should get involved, I clearly did not want to
disturb the president,'' <PERSON>Studdert</PERSON> said. ``But I decided, this is
what the president would have wanted us to do.''

<TEXT>
   A snake-venom researcher bitten by a deadly
viper rested comfortably <DATE>Sunday</DATE> while doctors considered whether to
treat him with antivenins from <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>, a
hospital spokesman said.
   <PERSON>William E. Haast</PERSON>, 78, remained in serious but stable condition at
the <ORGANIZATION>University of Utah Health Sciences Center</ORGANIZATION> after being bitten on
the left hand <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> by a Pakistani pit viper, also known as a
saw-scaled viper, said hospital spokesman <PERSON>John Dwan</PERSON>.
   ``<PERSON>Mr. Haast</PERSON> is resting very comfortably, eating and chatting with
friends,'' <PERSON>Dwan</PERSON> said. ``He's just in danger, if you will.''
   Haast, director of the <ORGANIZATION>Miami Serpentarium Laboratories</ORGANIZATION> at the
university's <ORGANIZATION>Research Park</ORGANIZATION>, has been bitten 148 times by snakes and
is immune to the venom of dozens of reptiles. But he had no immunity
to the viper's bite and checked himself into the hospital <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
   The saw-scaled viper's venom attacks its victim's ability to
produce fibrinogen, an element of blood that regulates coagulation.
A lack of fibrinogen can cause uncontrolled bleeding.
   <PERSON>Dwan</PERSON> said the level of <LOCATION>Haast</LOCATION>'s fibrinogen had been improving
slightly although it remained ``dangerously low'' <DATE>Sunday</DATE>.
   Doctors were replacing <PERSON>Haast</PERSON>'s fibrinogen with transfusions and
it appeared his system had begun to produce it again, <PERSON>Dwan</PERSON> said.
   He said <PERSON>Haast</PERSON>'s blood was being analyzed every four hours, and
that by <DATE>late Saturday</DATE> his fibrogen level was about one-third of
normal. On <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, he said, ``for all intents and purposes (it
was) at zero.''
   Haast's plight prompted an effort by <PERSON>Stephen Studdernt</PERSON>, special
assistant to President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>, to coordinate the acquisition of
antivenins from the three nations and expedite shipment to <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Dwan</PERSON> said antivenins from <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> had arrived, but he
did not know if the one from the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> had. The antivenin
from <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> was more specifically made to counteract venom from the
species of viper that bit <LOCATION>Haast</LOCATION>, he said.
   However, he said doctors were ``very leery about giving
medication to someone from a source about which we know very little
about.''
   Antivenins are made from horse serum and can cause negative side
effects such as lung and kidney problems, he said.
   ``We want to emphasize the fact that we're grateful to everyone
who went to such great lengths to get the antivenin,'' <PERSON>Dwan</PERSON> said.
``The decision on whether to use them or not will be based on <PERSON>Mr.
Haast</PERSON>'s condition. Hopefully we won't have to use them.''
   Haast had been treated earlier with antivenins from <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>'s
<LOCATION>San Diego Zoo</LOCATION> and from a lab in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, but <PERSON>Dwan</PERSON> said <DATE>Saturday</DATE>
he had not been given antivenins for about 24 hours.
   He said doctors also had contacted scientists and physicans in
<LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, across the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> to discuss treatment.
   ``It's a special kind of snake, with a special kind of poison,
and the immunology is complicated,'' <PERSON>Dwan</PERSON> said. ``Our physicians
aren't just winging it on their own.''
   <PERSON>Studdert</PERSON> said the Iranian government apparently did not interfere
with the shipment of the antivenin despite the strained relations
between the two nations. Iranian leader <PERSON>Ayatolla Khomeini</PERSON> has often
called the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> the ``great Satan.''
   The Pakistani pit viper is one of 1,000 exotic, poisonous snakes
<LOCATION>Haast</LOCATION> keeps at the laboratory, where their venom is extracted for
sale to universities and health organizations for research and the
manufacture of antivenins.

<TEXT>     on the tree top.;   When the wind blows,;   the cradle will rock.;   When
the bough breaks,;   the cradle will fall,;   And down will come Baby,;  
cradle and all.;   Now what's that all about? Why would a mom sing about Baby
plunging to a certain death when the breeze picks up? Do moms know or intuit
something about Mother Nature that the rest of us don't?;   Perhaps so.
Consider this:;   Just two years ago most of us were rocking gently in <ORGANIZATION>Ma
Nature</ORGANIZATION>'s cradle. Then, on <DATE>Oct. 17, 1989</DATE>, at 5:04 in the afternoon, the <LOCATION>Loma
Prieta</LOCATION> earthquake slammed the <LOCATION>Bay Area</LOCATION>, bringing death, destruction and,
perhaps most significant, disillusionment as it jolted our homes, our world.; 
 For many of us, the disillusionment was with <ORGANIZATION>Mother Nature</ORGANIZATION>, with our trust in
the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> itself. Sure, we'd read about killer earthquakes in <LOCATION>Armenia</LOCATION>,
hurricanes and typhoons in distant oceans, volcanoes in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION> and
even more remote parts of the world. But this is <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> and part of being
in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> is, or was, being gently rocked in Mom's cradle.;   Once that
bough breaks, you come to the conclusion that there's no end to the ways that
Mother Nature can get you. She can poison you, drown you, chew you up or burn
you to a crisp.;   In fact, <ORGANIZATION>Mother Nature</ORGANIZATION> has a lot in common with <PERSON>Lucrezia
Borgia</PERSON> or with <PERSON>Winnie Ruth Judd</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>'s infamous trunk murderer of the
<DATE>1930s</DATE> who hacked up a couple of acquaintances in <LOCATION>Phoenix</LOCATION> and checked them
through to <ORGANIZATION>Union Station</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> stuffed in several pieces of luggage.;
  Most of us have been looking at Mom with a somewhat more skeptical eye since
the 7.1 magnitude <LOCATION>Loma Prieta</LOCATION> quake. We all know now that the Big One -- the
Real Big One -- will hit one of these years or even one of these days and that
death and destruction will be much more widespread than it was two years
back.;   Don't be lulled to sleep. That bough can still break and that cradle
can still plummet to earth. Mother Nature has some other tricks up her
housecoat's sleeve. Some can knock you on your ass; some can kill you.;
RATTLESNAKES;   How about these bastards? Can you think of anything scarier
than rattlesnakes? (Well, maybe black widow spiders. Or sharks, now that I
think about it. See below.);   The rattlesnake is not man's best friend. Some
are even less so than others, particularly the Mojave rattlesnake, native to
<LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION> and a small portion of the <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION> desert.;   Our local
variety, the <ORGANIZATION>Northern Pacific Rattlesnake</ORGANIZATION>, is one of the more aggressive
rattlers. It will, when provoked, bite. About three-quarters of the time it
will also envenomate its victim, i.e., inject the unfortunate soul with a
potentially fatal mixture of proteins and enzymes that can cause serious nerve
and tissue damage if not treated in time.;   Last year, the <ORGANIZATION>Regional Poison
Center</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION> -- which serves <LOCATION>Santa Clara</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>San Benito</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Santa Cruz</LOCATION>,
<ORGANIZATION>Monterey</ORGANIZATION> and San <PERSON>Luis Obispo</PERSON> counties -- had 10 emergency calls about
rattlesnake bites from individuals and doctors. The center maintains a
24-hours-a-day hot line to provide over-the-phone help to poisoning victims
and doctors treating them.;   Four of the 10 victims logged by the center
developed life-threatening symptoms, according to <PERSON>Gary Everson</PERSON>, director of
the facility. None died.;   "The first thing we recommend, if it's at all
possible," says <PERSON>Everson</PERSON>, "is to go directly to a hospital.";   No one
recommends the old cut-and-suck-out-the-venom treatment anymore. An
overzealous application of this chestnut of the <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME> oaters of
our youth can result, experts say, in severed tendons or even cut arteries
that can lead to fatal bleeding.;   Anti-venin is prescribed, says <PERSON>Everson</PERSON>,
only when patients develop symptoms such as swelling and bruising around a
rattlesnake bite. Occasionally, something called the <PERSON>Sawyer</PERSON> extractor, a
suction cup on the end of a syringe, is recommended for hikers in rattlesnake
country far from medical treatment.;   Most of the snakebite calls to the
Poison Center come from <LOCATION>San Benito</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Santa Cruz</LOCATION> and San <PERSON>Luis Obispo</PERSON> counties,
although the rattler can be found throughout <LOCATION>Central California.</LOCATION>;   <PERSON>Naturalist
John Lane</PERSON>, director of education at the <ORGANIZATION>Santa Cruz Museum of Natural History</ORGANIZATION>,
recommends common sense as the best way to avoid snakebites: Don't walk
barefoot to the john at night when you're camping; don't pick up snakes, alive
or dead (even a dead rattler can envenomate you); don't stick your hand in
crevices or brush piles.;   "Most snakebite victims were doing something
totally stupid," says <PERSON>Lane</PERSON>, who notes that the vipers can be found throughout
the <ORGANIZATION>Golden State</ORGANIZATION> "from the beach to the top of <LOCATION>Mount Whitney</LOCATION>."; SPIDERS;  
<LOCATION>Arachnophobia</LOCATION>! Why not? Is there anything creepier than a spider?;   In our
neck of the woods there are apparently two dangerous spiders. <PERSON>Gary Everson</PERSON>
says one has never been seen, but has bitten some folks anyway.;   The deadly
spider that has been seen in <LOCATION>Central California</LOCATION> is the black widow, the
creepy-crawler with the distinctive red hourglass marking on the abdomen of
the mature female. (The female gets more press than the male because she tends
to eat the poor devil if he hangs around too long after sex.);   This spider
is particularly dangerous to children, old people and anyone with
cardiovascular problems.;   Don't stick your hand into places you can't see,
like the proverbial woodpile or into dark places under the house.;   Symptoms
of a black widow bite can include local pain, cramps in the back, chest,
shoulders or belly, and nausea, headache, vomiting and anxiety.;   If you get
bitten, rush to a hospital. First aid is not recommended at home. If you can't
see a doctor, call the <ORGANIZATION>Poison Control Center</ORGANIZATION>, which logged 34 black widow
bites in its five-county region last year.;   The other dangerous local
spider, experts think, is the infamous brown recluse or violin spider. (It has
a distinctive dark brown mark shaped like a violin, hence the name.) While its
bites aren't as potentially fatal as the black widow's, they can lead to
painful tissue loss.;   <PERSON>Everson</PERSON> notes that as far as he knows, no one has ever
seen a brown recluse or violin spider in these parts. However, since people
have suffered symptoms of brown recluse bites, it's assumed they're here.;  
The brown recluse or violin spider is what's called a necrotic arachnid. The
bite causes tissue around the area to die, a condition known as necrosis. It's
not uncommon for the dead tissue to have to be cut out, a painful process if
you wait for treatment, since the venom spreads outward from the bite, killing
more and more of the victim's flesh.;   Whether or not our local necrotic
arachnid is the brown recluse or some cousin, wisdom dictates keeping your
hands to yourself instead of poking into dark places and other hidey-holes.;
SHARKS;   Unfortunately, great white sharks love the seas off the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>
coastline, where they grow to two tons or more. Over the past four decades
there have been 57 reports of great white attacks, including seven that
resulted in deaths.;   The easiest way to avoid these killers, of course, is
to stay out of the water -- or to swim in lakes, rivers, pools and other
bodies of fresh water.;   The latest local victim, 32-year-old <PERSON>Eric Larsen</PERSON>,
saved his own life a few months ago by bopping the attacking great white on
the snout, pulling his arm out of the creature's toothy mouth, then struggling
back to the beach at <LOCATION>Davenport Landing</LOCATION>, 10 miles north of <LOCATION>Santa Cruz.</LOCATION>;   After
<PERSON>Larsen</PERSON>'s heroic efforts at self-preservation, a state <ORGANIZATION>Department of Fish</ORGANIZATION> and
Game biologist opined that "more people here die of bee stings than shark
attacks." That, of course, is of little solace to a surfer sporting a wetsuit
that makes him look like a tasty harbor seal to the 16-foot great white shark
circling nearby.; BEES;   Unless you're allergic to bees, you don't have to
worry about the occasional sting of the honeybee, wasp or yellow jacket. If
you are allergic, get to a hospital immediately.;   To relieve the pain, a
paste of baking soda can be put on the sting. And even though experts don't
really believe it, meat tenderizer rubbed onto the booboo seems to work for
some people.;   If you get a bee in your bonnet, or car, while you're behind
the wheel, don't kill yourself by driving into a tree while you're trying to
shoo the little bugger out the window.; AMPHIBIANS;   Yes, there are a
salamander and a couple of toads, including bufo vulgaris, that can, but
generally don't, secrete some dangerous milky goo through their skin. <PERSON>Gary
Everson</PERSON>, at the <ORGANIZATION>Poison Control Center</ORGANIZATION>, says the only case of this kind he can
recall is that of a dog that tried to eat a bad toad and had to go to the vet.
He does not recall whether <PERSON>Bowser</PERSON> survived.;   Though this milky secretion can
cause paralysis, cases are so infrequent that <PERSON>Everson</PERSON> advises parents not to
become hysterical if Junior picks up a frog.; JELLYFISH;   The gelatinous
creatures found occasionally along the <LOCATION>Central California</LOCATION> coastline can cause
painful stings but nothing like the infamous Portuguese-man-of-war or the
lethal box jellyfish of tropical ocean waters.; SCORPIONS;   Another stinger,
but not anything to worry about, certainly not as bad as the feared bark
scorpion of the <ORGANIZATION>Southwest</ORGANIZATION> deserts. The local version is dangerous only to
people with allergies, according to <PERSON>John Lane</PERSON>, naturalist at the <ORGANIZATION>Santa Cruz
Museum of Natural</ORGANIZATION> History.; SHELLFISH;   If you want to scare yourself
sometime, call the <ORGANIZATION>State Health Department</ORGANIZATION>'s Shellfish Information Line at
(415) 540-2605. I did, and I've decided I'm no longer quite so upset that the
voracious little sea otters have scavenged most of the <LOCATION>Pismo</LOCATION> clams from the
<LOCATION>Santa Cruz County</LOCATION> beaches where I used to dig them.;   Presently, the annual
mussel quarantine is in effect until the end of <DATE>October</DATE>. Going into effect
each <DATE>May 1</DATE>, the quarantine is designed to protect us from paralytic shellfish
poisoning -- which is just what it sounds like and can kill you.;   When I
called the hot line last month there was another ban in effect for all bivalve
shellfish taken along the <LOCATION>Marin</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Sonoma County</LOCATION> coastlines. In <DATE>August</DATE>, some
people had ignored the ban and scarfed some mussels in <LOCATION>Sonoma County</LOCATION>. Three,
including one person in critical condition, had to be airlifted to the
hospital.;   Another recent state order prohibited eating cockles and
littleneck clams gathered between <ORGANIZATION>Monterey</ORGANIZATION> and Marin counties. Also, the state
said not to eat the guts, the dark parts, of any shellfish caught along the
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION> coastline.;   It seems that shellfish eat highly toxic plankton,
then concentrate the poison in their gooey bodies -- where it can prove lethal
to humans.;   "Probably as many people die from shellfish poisoning as from
rattlesnake bites," warns naturalist <PERSON>John Lane.</PERSON>; TICKS;   While <PERSON>Gary Everson</PERSON>
says there are no documented cases of full-blown <ORGANIZATION>Lyme Disease</ORGANIZATION> developing in
<LOCATION>Central California</LOCATION>, he points out that doctors in the region have used
antibiotics to stop the spread of the characteristic target-shaped rash around
some tick bites. Medication is only recommended, he says, if symptoms of Lyme
Disease develop.;   <LOCATION>LIGHTNING</LOCATION>;   Two <LOCATION>Monterey County</LOCATION> farmworkers were killed
by lightning just a few weeks ago. We've read about golfers being struck by
bolts of lightning while standing on the fairway. The best advice is either to
get inside or, if that's impossible, to become unobtrusive, to wait out the
electrical storm lying in a hole or swale.; MUSHROOMS;   We've all heard about
the mythical family that used to live down the street but was wiped out by
some poisonous toadstools after a foray into the woods looking for edible
mushrooms.;   And most of us have read about the real families from other
parts of the world who've gone mushroom-hunting here in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> only to get
sick or die after eating some highly toxic fungi that resemble tasty varieties
that are common -- and safe -- back home.;   There is a very popular mushroom
in <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>, for instance -- <PERSON>Julius Caesar</PERSON>'s mushroom -- that resembles the
delicious coccora or amanita calyptrata found near oak and madrone trees in
our part of the New World. Unfortunately, the Italian fungus also bears a
dangerously close resemblance to the lethal amanita phalloides or "death cap"
mushroom.;   Also, says <PERSON>Phil Carpenter</PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION>Fungus Federation of
Santa Cruz</ORGANIZATION>, there is apparently a resemblance between the death cap and a
popular mushroom of <LOCATION>Southeast Asia.</LOCATION>;   <ORGANIZATION>Carpenter</ORGANIZATION> warns that the death cap and
the "destroying angel," or amanita ocreata, are not only lethal but quite
common in this area.;   This pair is doubly dangerous because by the time
symptoms appear, 12 to 24 hours after ingestion, the kidneys and livers of
victims are already failing. "It's an ugly way to go," warns <PERSON>Carpenter</PERSON>. "You
die in your own poisons.";   There are plenty of other poisonous mushrooms out
there under the oaks and in the woods, but none so dangerous as the death cap
and destroying angel.;   <ORGANIZATION>Carpenter</ORGANIZATION> stresses that there are no tests for
amateurs to determine whether a mushroom is benign or a killer.;   And <PERSON>Gary
Everson</PERSON>, at the Poison Center, notes that "It's impossible to identify
mushrooms over the phone.";   <ORGANIZATION>The Fungus Federation</ORGANIZATION>, which has a membership
stretching from <LOCATION>Redwood City</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Monterey</LOCATION>, meets monthly at the
<ORGANIZATION>Santa Cruz Museum of Natural History</ORGANIZATION>. For more information call (408)
684-2275.; PLANTS;   There is a veritable salad of dangerous plants out
there.;   Not too long ago, some schoolchildren in <LOCATION>Santa Cruz</LOCATION> required
treatment after mistakenly sampling poison hemlock on a field trip to a nearby
state park. This weed, the one that did in <LOCATION>Socrates</LOCATION>, is plentiful -- but not
too difficult to identify. Check for the purple spots on the green stalk of
this plant, which is common in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> and sometimes thick along roadsides
and in moist areas.;   Poison hemlock can grow to a height of 10 feet and has
small white flowers in little clusters at the top. Ingestion can cause
vomiting, diarrhea, dizziness and all the other usual symptoms of poisoning,
and can result in fatal respiratory failure.;   Other seriously toxic plants
include the oleander, which has been planted extensively along the sides and
down the center dividers of <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>'s freeways; the English yew, an
ornamental in many gardens; pokeweed, castor bean, foxglove, jimsonweed and
meadow death camas.;   The long and short of it is Don't Eat Plants You Don't
Know To Be Safe and Edible.;   IT SOUNDS LIKE MOM USED TO SOUND, DOESN'T it?
Remember the warnings?;   "Don't play in the street. Don't put strange things
in your mouth. Don't talk to strangers. Stay out of the water (or don't swim
unless you're on the 'buddy system'). Don't put your hand in dark places.";  
However, lest we start looking at <ORGANIZATION>Mother Nature</ORGANIZATION> with a completely jaundiced
eye, let's keep in mind the simple fact that humanity is generally much more
adept than she is at bumping itself off. You're still far more likely to die
cruising home behind the wheel after happy hour than in a bosky glade after
gnawing some suspicious mushrooms and unknown weeds.;   Consider the motor
car:;   In <DATE>1989</DATE>, according to statistics gathered by the state <ORGANIZATION>Department of
Health Services</ORGANIZATION>, 5,663 people died as the result of motor vehicle accidents on
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION> highways and byways, most of them -- 4,092 -- white males.;   In
fact, according to the <ORGANIZATION>National Safety Council</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> records more motor
vehicle fatalities than any of the remaining 49 states, more than half-again
as many as <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, which ranks second on the grim list of traffic deaths. The
good news, however, is that our highway death rate is below the national
average, according to the <ORGANIZATION>Safety Council</ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> motorists, passengers and
unlucky bystanders cash in their chips at the rate of 2 for every 100 million
miles driven. The national highway death rate is 2.2 victims per 100 million
miles. Neighboring <LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION> has the worst rate, 3.6 per 100 million miles.;   Or
think about this:;   The second major cause of fatal injury in the <ORGANIZATION>Golden
State</ORGANIZATION> is suicide! Word from <LOCATION>Sacramento</LOCATION> is that 3,862 Californians took their
own lives in <DATE>1989</DATE> -- the vast majority of them white males.;   Again eclipsing
the minuscule number of victims of Mother Nature, Californians murdered 3,298
of their number in <DATE>1989</DATE> -- with white males continuing to lead the deadly pack
with 2,633 victims.;   Why white males? <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Department of Health
Services</ORGANIZATION> opines that since "male deaths substantially outnumber female deaths
for causes like vehicular mishaps, poisonings, homicide and suicide" the
figures "are consistent with the notion that males in our culture find
themselves or even place themselves in situations carrying a high risk of
injury." I didn't say that; the Emergency Preparedness and <ORGANIZATION>Injury Control
Program</ORGANIZATION> of the health department did, in its "Fatal Injuries in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>,
<DATE>1988</DATE>" report.;   While white males tend to die of injuries in greater numbers
than members of ethnic minorities, the rates of injury-related deaths per
capita are higher among black and Hispanic populations. Suicide rates are
lower, but, the state reports, this "is more than offset by their greater risk
of death by such causes as homicide, poisonings, pedestrian mishaps and
drowning.";   And disease, of course, kills more Californians than <ORGANIZATION>Mother
Nature</ORGANIZATION> and mankind together combine to wipe out. In <DATE>1988</DATE>, for instance, 16,354
cancer deaths were recorded in the state and 12,675 people died of heart
disease. That same year 3,094 Californians died of AIDS.;   That kind of
number-crunching, of course, provides no comfort to the families of the 64
people killed by the <LOCATION>Loma Prieta</LOCATION> earthquake or the two farmworkers struck by
lightning south of <LOCATION>Salinas</LOCATION> <DATE>last month</DATE>. But the figures do make Mother Nature
seem somewhat benign compared with the ravages of disease and the homicidal
tendencies of our own species.;   Of course, if you're a fatalist you might
believe that somewhere out there there's a spider -- or a bullet or a
toadstool or a jetliner -- with your name on it. And if you're a fatalist, you
know what? You're probably right.  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Desert Shield Soldiers Shipped to Germany With Broken Bones,
Snakebite</HEAD>

<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 1,400 <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> troops assigned
to Operation Desert Shield have been airlifted to <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> for
treatment of broken bones, depression, snake bites and other
afflictions, military officials say.
   But the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> is treating fewer GIs than anticipated for a
population of 230,000 people, ``based on health risk assessments
for that region of the world,'' said <PERSON>Barbara Slifer</PERSON>, spokeswoman
for the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>7th Medical Command</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Heidelberg</LOCATION>.
   Forty-three soldiers have died in the deployment, mostly in
accidents.
   Officials say two <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> hospitals in <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> had received 926
evacuated patients as of <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME>, and the <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION>
hospital in <LOCATION>Wiesbaden</LOCATION> had received 515 since <DATE>Aug. 11</DATE>, when <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
troops were sent to <LOCATION>Saudi Arabia</LOCATION>.
   The figures mean that of the 230,000 GIs sent to the <LOCATION>Persian
Gulf</LOCATION> region, about one soldier in every 166 has had a medical
problem.
   Some have been treated and returned to the <LOCATION>Persian Gulf</LOCATION> region,
and others with more serious conditions have been transferred to
the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, said <PERSON>Ms. Slifer</PERSON>.
   She said 88 remained hospitalized at the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION>'s regional
hospital in <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION> and 53 in the regional hospital at Landsthul.
Capt. <PERSON>Robert Lenahan</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION>'s hospital in <LOCATION>Wiesbaden</LOCATION> said
39 Desert Shield patients were still there as of <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
   Military medical officials have said that facilities newly set
up in the gulf region can care for most casualties as well as
hospitals anywhere. But evacuating patients to <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> keep beds
free in the gulf in case of hostilities.
   The medical problems ``run the gamut,'' <PERSON>Ms. Slifer</PERSON> said.
   ``The predominant area of care that we've been providing is
orthopedic, broken bones. We've had one snakebite case, we've had
gallbladder attacks,'' she said.
   She said a few soldiers were also sent back for psychological
care.
   ``I think the psychological ailments are pretty much what you
would expect in any type of military-type environment.''
   Most of the patients coming through <LOCATION>Wiesbaden</LOCATION> are sent back to
the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, unless they can be treated in ``a fairly short
timeframe,'' <PERSON>Lenahan</PERSON> said.
   ``But we have people coming back with kidney stones, torn knee
ligaments, things that take more than just a couple of weeks to
repair,'' <PERSON>Lenahan</PERSON> said.
   He said that long-term patients requiring treatment of more than
three to four weeks are sent back to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> ``so that we
still have enough empty beds here for other patients that may come
up.''
   In addition to injuries, patients needed treatment for
allergies, asthma and dermatological problems, he said.
   He said that the allergies and asthma are apparently due to the
very dry climate in <LOCATION>Saudi Arabia</LOCATION>. ``People who wouldn't normally
have asthma problems are experiencing that.''

<HEADLINE>  SERPENTS DON'T RATTLE SNAKE-HANDLING FAITHFUL  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     "Yes, Lord," answers a parishioner.;    "Praise JEEsus," howls another.;   
This is the Church of the Lord Jesus in the last state in the union where
religious snake-handling is legal. The church isn't affiliated with any
official Christian denomination. It has no religious statuary, no baptismal
fountain, not even a cross. Which is not to suggest it has no religion.;   
"I'm a snake-handler," says <PERSON>Chafin</PERSON>. His mother beams. She's here too, and
she's holding a hissing rattler of her own.;    <PERSON>Chafin</PERSON> is 58, a disabled coal
miner and a Korean War vet, and like the five dozen people standing hip to
buttock in this makeshift rural church, he believes in the <LOCATION>New Testament</LOCATION>
exactly as it was written. And that includes the Book of Mark, Chapter 16,
Verse 18, where Jesus says, "They shall take up serpents; and if they drink
any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick,
and they shall recover.";    And so it is that each dance with snakes is a
test of faith.;    In 35 years of snake-handling, <PERSON>Chafin</PERSON> says, he's been
bitten 116 times. He's been fanged on the hands, the arms, and not long ago a
five-foot diamondback took him through the right eyebrow.;    Like all
snake-handlers, <PERSON>Chafin</PERSON> says he's never treated a bite with anything other than
prayer.;    Around him are some 50 members of his church. Not one of them
drinks, not one of them smokes, and all of them dress like ladies and gents.
The rules in this church are posted high for anyone to see. Neatness is
required. "Lying" is outlawed, along with "gossiping" and "backbiting.";   
Here is <PERSON>Lydia Hollins</PERSON>, the organist. She is <ORGANIZATION>Dewey</ORGANIZATION>'s niece, a handsome woman of
38.;    <PERSON>Hollins</PERSON> is the daughter of <PERSON>Columbia Chafin</PERSON>, who died in <DATE>1962</DATE>, when
<PERSON>Lydia</PERSON> was just a girl. She snake-bit died, at the age of 22. To this day, she
remains the Church of the <ORGANIZATION>Lord Jesus</ORGANIZATION>'s only fatality, <PERSON>Dewey Chafin</PERSON> says. She
was his sister.;    And now the dead woman's daughter is gently cradling a
big- bellied viper in both hands, and praising the <LOCATION>Lord.</LOCATION>;    There is
fanaticism in this room, and there is bravery and passion and something
strangely moving that is not easily put into words.;    Snake-handlers have
been practicing their religion throughout <LOCATION>Appalachia</LOCATION> and in the hills and
hollows of <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION> since the <DATE>turn of the century</DATE>. It's still going on in
all of those places, most always in defiance of one law or another. Not here.;
   According to <PERSON>Kenneth Ambrose</PERSON>, a sociologist at <ORGANIZATION>Marshall University</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Huntington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>W. Va.</LOCATION>, who has studied snake- handling, politicians in the state
of <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION> have learned that it's useless to try to legislate against
something that folks want to do, just because it's for their own good.;   
Even when untreated, bites from <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION>'s venomous snakes seldom kill
healthy adults, but they sometimes do. On the average, snakebites kill 13
Americans a year, but since <DATE>1909</DATE>, only a dozen or so of those deaths have been
traced to religious ceremonies.;    Snake-handlers believe they survive
through the power of their prayer, and they'll brook no argument on that
point.;    As an impromptu rendition of "Reach Out and Touch the Lord" blasts
through the room, the children are separated in the back of the room. The
adults are on their feet and moving. Everyone is dancing -- a free-style,
spirited, rolling shuffle- stomp. Most everyone is singing.;    Snakes are
passed from hand to hand, man to woman, woman to man, man to man, gingerly,
reverently.;    When the music stops after maybe a quarter hour of snake-
handling, the men and women almost reluctantly place the animals back in the
boxes.;    "A lot of people call us a lot of names because of the way we
choose to worship the Lord. They think we're not all there because we handle
snakes," <ORGANIZATION>Pastor Bob Elkins</ORGANIZATION> says at a microphone. "We don't try to push our
religion on anybody.";    "Yes, Jesus.";    "They say when we get bit we're
just tempting the Lord. Well, it says right in the <LOCATION>Bible</LOCATION> that the Lord can't
be tempted. It's in the Book of James.";    "Amen, Jesus.";    Then <ORGANIZATION>Elkins</ORGANIZATION>
announces: "Remember, if you're under 18, stay out of the boxes."  </TEXT>

<TEXT>
   A man who said he put a rattlesnake over
the shoulder of a 21-month-old girl to show her it would not hurt
her was convicted of manslaughter in the child's death from
snakebite.
   <PERSON>Darrell Wessendorf</PERSON>, 24, faces a possible one- to 15-year prison
sentence for the <DATE>May 8, 1987</DATE>, death of <ORGANIZATION>Stevie LuRen Kirkwood of La
Verkin</ORGANIZATION>.
   Wessendorf had been charged with second-degree murder, which
carries a possible sentence of five years to life. He had pleaded
innocent by reason of insanity.
   Wessendorf had caused a ``grave risk of death'' by bringing the
snake so close to the girl and ``engaging in activities that
eventually caused the reptile to bite the child,'' District <PERSON>Judge
J. Phillip Eves</PERSON> said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
   Wessendorf, a former Page, <LOCATION>Ariz.</LOCATION>, resident, said he was trying
to show the girl that the snake would not hurt her when it bit her
on the shoulder.
   He said he showed her the snake that he had found on a nearby
road and partially placed it over her shoulder. The child's mother
entered the room and screamed, causing Wessendorf to flinch and the
snake to bite the child, he said.
   Defense attorney <PERSON>J. MacArthur Wright</PERSON> argued that only <PERCENT>0.2
percent</PERCENT> of those bitten by rattlesnakes die and that those bitten
often are not treated. He said the judge had to ``make a
distinction here on what constitutes a grave risk of death.''

   Lawrence, Kan. -- For some it would have been a nightmare
come true. The forest was crowded with trees and brush on a
day that hung heavy with dark, ominous clouds, suffocating
humidity and an eerie calm that's all but unheard of in a
state named after the southwind. Except for the occasional
soothing whistle of a bobwhite quail, the woods seemed void
of natural noises.
   Yet there were plenty of unnatural sounds being made by
the two men who preceded me along a rock-strewn ridgetop. The
ring of metal against stone and the clack of stone against
stone left no doubt of their determination as the pair used
small picks and gloved hands to lift and overturn tire-sized
rocks. Errol Hooper was the first to strike pay dirt. Happy
with his find, Mr. Hooper placed it in Joe Collins's waiting
hands -- a treasure of scales, wriggling tail and flicking
tongue.

<TEXT>
   Though the small, brown-striped lizard was gently resting
in a single hand, it was as though it was being held by two
different people. On the one hand, <PERSON>Mr. Collins</PERSON> spoke as a
nationally-respected zoologist when he said, "five-lined
skink, you can tell by the head that it's a female and she's
obviously carrying an abdomen full of eggs that are about
ready to be laid. She has a regenerated tail. You can tell by
the color that her original broke off."
   Yet the excited eagerness of his fingers and the gleam in
his eyes as <PERSON>Mr. Collins</PERSON> examined the five-inch reptile were
that of a boy who's deep into an activity that he dearly
loves.
   <PERSON>Mr. Collins</PERSON>'s affair with herpetology (the study of
reptiles and amphibians) is one that has spanned most of his
half-century of life. It began, he said, with the capture and
domestication of a queen snake from the <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> hardwoods. It
intensified quickly when he tried to learn more about
reptiles.
   "It was a really fun time when I was growing up, because
there really wasn't a lot known about these kinds of animals.
We were still in the discovery stage on a lot of things,"
said <PERSON>Mr. Collins</PERSON>, now a herpetologist and editor for the
<ORGANIZATION>Museum of Natural History</ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Kansas</ORGANIZATION>. "Since
there was no real monetary use for reptiles, very little time
had been spent studying and writing about them. We spent a
lot of time with new and not yet discovered things. It wasn't
until <DATE>1958</DATE> that <PERSON>Roger Conant</PERSON> came out with the first handbook
for <PERSON>Peterson</PERSON> Field Guides."
   Yet it was still dozens of years before <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> began to
drop its "the only good snake is a dead snake" mentality.
Though keeping lizards and snakes for pets has long been
fashionable in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Collins</PERSON> credits <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s growing
environmental and natural awareness with a skyrocketing
interest in herpetology.
   "People are really figuring out that reptiles offer a
wealth of recreational value," said <PERSON>Mr. Collins</PERSON>. "We're not
up there with the bird people yet, but we're growing. We have
an increasing number of herpetological societies. Back in the
late '70s I estimated their memberships at 10,000. That's got
to be 50,000 now. . .and there are many, many more who don't
belong to an organization."
   Minutes after he'd released the skink, <PERSON>Mr. Hooper</PERSON> lifted a
western worm snake from its lair. With a coal-black back and
a vivid, carnation-pink belly, the docile snake's beauty
rivaled the plumage of a cock pheasant or a drake wood duck.
And you could touch it, too.
   Unlike most wildlife observation, herping can provide a
hands-on, as well as an eyes-on, experience. "When was the
last time you heard of someone holding and stroking a
cardinal or a sandhill crane. We've sure got that aspect over
birding," joked <PERSON>Mr. Collins</PERSON>. "You get a whole new
appreciation for living things when you can hold them and get
a feel for what they're like." And if you like them, you can
often take them home.
   "The concept of keeping reptiles is really catching on in
this country," said <PERSON>Mr. Collins</PERSON>. "In fact, some states are
really encouraging youngsters to get a lizard, snake or
salamander for a pet. Here in <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION> you can keep up to five
of any one species as long as it's not on the threatened and
endangered list. Some reptiles really adapt well to
{captivity}. That's something that's simply not true with
wild mammals and birds."
   Unquestionably the best introduction to all this is a
field guide that <PERSON>Mr. Collins</PERSON> recently co-authored with a
friend he calls "the grand old man of herpetology"<PERSON>Roger
Conant</PERSON>. "Reptiles and Amphibians Eastern/Central <LOCATION>North
America</LOCATION>" (<ORGANIZATION>Houghton Mifflin Co.</ORGANIZATION>, 450 pages, <MONEY>$17.95</MONEY>) gives a
detailed description of 595 species and subspecies. The book,
part of the prestigious <ORGANIZATION>Peterson Field Guide</ORGANIZATION> series, contains
more than a thousand full-color plate illustrations and
drawings, and more than 300 detailed distribution maps.
   Just as importantly, this definitive guide offers solid
information on the tools and techniques for searching for,
handling and keeping reptiles and amphibians. There's also a
chapter on poisonous snakebites, an aspect of the field that
<PERSON>Mr. Collins</PERSON> claims adds spice to the life of a herpetologist:
"There's always been a mystique around animals that can hurt
you -- grizzly bears, mountain lions, gray wolves. .
.rattlesnakes. The danger of dying from a snakebite is
greatly exaggerated, but it can keep things interesting."
   Our herping trip got "interesting" when we left the rocky
ridge <PERSON>Mr. Collins</PERSON> nicknamed "hernia heaven" and headed for
the car. <PERSON>Mr. Hooper</PERSON> spotted a yard -- plus timber rattlesnake
stretched beside a wood rat nest. He closed to within a few
feet of the snake and watched as it lazily crawled beneath a
table-sized slab of limestone near where we stood. When its
dangerous head was well under the rock, <PERSON>Mr. Collins</PERSON> stomped
the ground to draw the rattle. The sound brought a grin to
his face that lasted for hours.
   "I've seen lots of them but there's always something
special about seeing a timber rattler," <PERSON>Mr. Collins</PERSON> later
said. "It can make a good morning even more memorable. That's
the kind of experience that we dream about."

<TEXT>
   The first time <PERSON>William Haast</PERSON> brought home
poisonous snakes, his horrified mother left home for three days. She
came back only because she realized her son's interest wasn't about
to slither away.
   At 78, <PERSON>Haast</PERSON> remains a self-described ``snake-aholic,'' who has
kept his energy and enthusiasm though he just weathered his 148th
snake bite. It is not surprising it was the viper, not <PERSON>Haast</PERSON>, who
passed on.
   Haast is founder and director of the <ORGANIZATION>Miami Serpentarium
Laboratories</ORGANIZATION>, which he started in <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> in <DATE>1946</DATE>. He relocated the
lab to Salt <LOCATION>Lake City</LOCATION> five years ago to concentrate on venom
research and production.
   Haast claims to be the first to standardize snake venom and
produce it for research use. His clients include <ORGANIZATION>Wyeth Laboratories</ORGANIZATION>,
the only producer of antivenins in <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION>, and almost every
university in the country. He also has helped foster research into
the use of venom against such diseases as polio, multiple sclerosis
and AIDS.
   Haast was in his lab collecting venom from a Pakistani pit viper
<DATE>Feb. 28</DATE> when the serpent bit his left thumb. Not overly concerned,
he waited to see if the weekly venom injections he has given himself
for 40 years would provide immunity to the poison.
   When the bite was still bleeding after 24 hours, he took himself
to the hospital and was diagnosed in critical condition, the venom
robbing his blood of the ability to clot. Doctors said he could have
bled to death from a bump or fall.
   ``I guess I excited every hematologist (blood doctor) in town,''
he said. ``They dug up all the information they had on snake bites.''
   Haast, who was released from the hospital <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, praised the
extraordinary efforts in his behalf to obtain antivenins from
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> and even from private sources
in <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION>. A <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> aide helped contact foreign sources and ease
passage of the medicines through Customs.
   ``Those people involved in getting the antivenins are the heroes
of the story,'' he said. ``All I am is the result of an accident.''
Haast's condition started improving after he received the serum from
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, and doctors in the end opted not to use the foreign
serums.
   The night before <PERSON>Haast</PERSON> was bitten, he and <PERSON>Nancy Harrell</PERSON>, who
helps direct the lab, went to a local steak house for what she
called ``anything goes day.''
   Sometimes at the end of the month <LOCATION>Haast</LOCATION> abandons a strict routine
that includes eating animal protein only on even-numbered days and
never touching refined sugar. <TIME>This night</TIME>, he consumed four chocolate
sundaes.
   ``When I let myself go, I really let go,'' he said.
   The next day, <PERSON>Harrell</PERSON> said, <PERSON>Haast</PERSON> was a little hastier than usual
in his work. ``He was really buzzing around the lab that day,'' she
said.
   He believes his strict regimen _ which also includes always
walking up the 11 flights to his condominium _ helped him overcome
the viper's venom and to cleanse his system. It wasn't until nine
days after the bite that he ate solid food. Meantime, the snake had
died of natural causes.
   Haast, first bitten in <DATE>1926</DATE>, says his interest in snakes dates
back nearly 70 years to when he collected garter snakes out of
canals in <LOCATION>Paterson</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>
   In <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Haast</LOCATION>'s serpentarium near the highway to the <LOCATION>Florida
Keys</LOCATION> was as much a tourist attraction as a laboratory. Visitors
could watch from a glass-enclosed amphitheater while <LOCATION>Haast</LOCATION> extracted
venom from hundreds of different species of snakes.
   He and <PERSON>Harrell</PERSON> moved the facility to <LOCATION>Salt Lake City</LOCATION> in <DATE>1984</DATE> to
focus more on research. He declines to say just how well the
business is faring except to say it's ``holding its own.''
   Haast collects venom from each snake about once a week, at the
same time they are fed a high-protein formula he mixes himself.
Harrell helps with the feedings; feeding and venom collection are
done at the same time to minimize trauma to the snakes.
   Nearly 50 years ago, <PERSON>Haast</PERSON> had a hunch that snake venom may be
valuable in treating polio and was proved right. Later, he had the
same feeling about multiple sclerosis and more recently has explored
the possibility of using venom in the fight against AIDS.
   Haast and <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION> businessman <PERSON>Alan Glanville</PERSON> have organized AIDS
experimental treatment and research in <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>. Both hesitate to
discuss the project, saying it is in its infancy and the hospitals
and researchers involved require anonymity.
   Even after his latest brush with death, <PERSON>Haast</PERSON> says there is
little chance he will retire. In fact, he plans to start giving
himself booster shots to create an immunity to the species of viper
that bit him.

   "Snakebite," an example of one of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s most secret, high-technology weapons systems, went on display at a <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Air Force</ORGANIZATION> base here yesterday for the first time. 
Soon, Soviet inspectors will scrutinize the newly groomed system. 
Then, Snakebite will be sawed apart, crushed, and torched in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> 

   It is all part of the process of removing and destroying an entire class of European-based nuclear weapons as called for in the new superpower arms treaty recently ratified by the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Senate</ORGANIZATION> and the Supreme Soviet. 

   Looking like a low-slung, camouflaged truck, Snakebite and other vehicles that carry nuclear-tipped cruise missiles were put on display here and at three other <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> bases in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> as part of unprecedented press briefings. 
The vehicles will be the star attractions next month, when the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> formally begin the process of carrying out the arms treaty. 

   <LOCATION>Greenham Common</LOCATION>, 60 miles west of <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, is home to most of <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>'s allotment of U.S.-manned cruise missiles. 
It is one of 27 <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> bases that will be visited by a team of 200 Soviet inspectors in the first phase of the destruction of medium-range nuclear missiles in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>. 
Under the treaty, effective last week, Soviet inspectors will visit here and other sites where the missiles are stored or produced in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Belgium</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>Netherlands</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>. 
About 200 <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> inspectors will tour 133 bases in the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Eastern Europe</LOCATION>, said Lt. Col. <PERSON>Ken Keating</PERSON>, an official of the new <ORGANIZATION>U.S. On-Site Inspection Agency</ORGANIZATION>, at yesterday's news conference here. 

   In <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON>Eduard Shevardnadze</PERSON> invited members of the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION> and other international bodies to watch the first round of destruction of Soviet intermediate-range nuclear missiles. 
"This, of course, is not the <ORGANIZATION>Bolshoi Theater</ORGANIZATION>, but a major premiere nonetheless, a momentous historic event," <PERSON>Mr. Shevardnadze</PERSON> said. 
He didn't say where the destruction would take place. 

   At <ORGANIZATION>Greenham Common</ORGANIZATION>, Col. <PERSON>Bill Jones</PERSON>, its commander, gave reporters a base tour, including a look at the mammoth, bunker-like garages where cruise-missile launch vehicles are stored. 
Like Snakebite, each vehicle carries four missiles, each with a thermonuclear warhead capable of incinerating a medium-sized city. 

   The Soviet inspectors "have 48 hours to tell me where they want to go" and then they will have 24 hours to examine the base, said Col. <PERSON>Jones</PERSON>. 
The inspectors will be able to measure and weigh parts of the missile system and examine it with portable radiation-detection devices. 

   The inspection job will require a full-time bureaucracy on each side. 
After the initial "baseline inspection," designed to affirm the number of missiles at each site, there will be additional inspections for three years to ensure the weapons' removal and destruction. 
A ten-year inspection period will follow to make sure new weapons aren't produced. 

   According to Lt. Col. <PERSON>Keating</PERSON>, Snakebite's missiles will be taken to <ORGANIZATION>Davis-Monthan Air Force Base</ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION>Tucson</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ariz.</LOCATION>, and then cut in half, lengthwise. 
The launch vehicle also will be destroyed. 
Nuclear warheads, which aren't covered by the treaty, will be removed and recycled into other weapons systems. 

   Lt. Col. <PERSON>Keating</PERSON> said each side will decide when and where to deploy its inspection teams. 
The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> doesn't know when the first Soviet visitors will arrive at <LOCATION>Greenham</LOCATION> Common or other nuclear-weapons bases. 
Women demonstrators, who have staged some memorable protests at <LOCATION>Greenham</LOCATION> Common over the past five years, showed up in only token force yesterday. 
They pushed a sign up to the base's fence that read: "Bread, not Bombs."

   GUAM -- Tourist advisory: While in Guam, keep your toilet

   Snakes like to come in through the toilets.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   At night, they hang from trees like fat, brown strands of
cooked spaghetti. They attack <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> military bases. They
slither up power poles. They wipe out entire bird
populations, attack children and crawl into homes looking for
food. Some are 10 feet long. And they're so tough they
actually can bump up against an electrified fence and keep
coming back for more.
   This is really gross.
   There are as many as three million snakes here on a land
mass of 212 square miles. That's an average of 14,000 snakes
per square mile, or 22 snakes for every man, woman and child.
Now, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> government, armed with <MONEY>$1.5 million</MONEY> from
<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>, is mounting a counterattack. Wildlife biologist
<PERSON>Thomas Fritts</PERSON> and a team of researchers have been zapping the
snakes silly in experimental electric corrals, luring them
into traps, testing fumigants and trying to figure out if, in
the case of snakes, sex can kill. If all else fails, they
figure maybe at least they can establish some "snake-free
zones."
   What makes this research work so difficult is the nature
of the foe. "Boiga irregularis" -- known as a brown tree
snake -- lives in trees but is equally adept on the ground,
so it's difficult to keep the snake in or out of any large
area. The snakes are hard to starve out because they will
dine on any small critter.
   Indigenous to the <LOCATION>Solomon Islands</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New Guinea</LOCATION> and northern
<LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>, the snakes first turned up in <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> shortly after
World War II, apparently as stowaways on a cargo ship. They
proliferate maddeningly fast because they have no natural
predators on <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION>. For decades, the snakes were mostly
unnoticed, content to devour lizards and birds. But by the
early <DATE>1980s</DATE> local biologists discovered the snakes had wiped
out nine of 12 native birds species, critically depleted the
rest and had run so low on lizards that they began foraging
in homes for more varied food.
   "Two snakes came through the commode of my home the other
day," says <PERSON>Marilyn D.A. Manibusan</PERSON>, a territorial senator. "I
threw boiling water at them." A lot of people put screens
over their sewer vents to keep the snakes from entering via
the toilet.
   By day, the nocturnal snakes seem to disappear. Indeed,
many people in <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> say they've never seen one. But the
snakes, which are mildly poisonous, have been found coiled
around screaming infants, their mouths locked on tiny hands
in vain attempts to swallow the babies. Though no known
deaths have resulted, 53 emergency room cases of snakebites
were reported in the <ORGANIZATION>Guam Memorial Hospital</ORGANIZATION> between <DATE>1986</DATE> and
<DATE>1989</DATE>, including four in which doctors said infant victims
came perilously close to death.
   The problem finally drew widespread public attention after
the snakes began crawling over power lines and electrocuting
themselves, knocking out power in the process. Between <DATE>1978</DATE>
and <DATE>1990</DATE>, <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> was hit by an estimated 680 snake-related
outages, in some cases blacking out the entire island.
Exasperated, the <ORGANIZATION>Guam Power Authority</ORGANIZATION> wound up turning off
from dusk to dawn a utility pole that had suffered 17 faults,
effectively ceding it to the snakes.
   The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> military soon found out itself that the reptile
is a resourceful opponent. At one base, commanders ordered
the bottoms of power poles wrapped with sleeves of slick
metal in hopes of keeping the snakes off. They were chagrined
to later discover the snakes don't even go up the poles; they
prefer the supporting guy wires. So the next tack was to
erect screen-wire barriers around the guy wires. The snakes
simply climbed over.
   So, what to do?
   <PERSON>Gordon Rodda</PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION>Arizona Cooperative Fish</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Wildlife
Research Unit</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Tucson</LOCATION>, tried to build a better snake trap.
He tried using lizards, chicken litter and quail as bait, but
found that white mice work best. "If you put out 100 traps
with quail bait, you find six snakes in them, but with white
mice you find 25 snakes out of 100 traps," he says.
   The downside: "We don't really want to import a million
white mice to <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION>," says <PERSON>Mr. Fritts</PERSON>. So <PERSON>Mr. Fritts</PERSON> says the
researchers hope to come up with an artificial white mouse
that can be used in its place.
   In fact, just about every solution seems to have a catch.
Officials considered importing mongooses or paying a bounty
on dead snakes. But mongooses hunt by day and sleep by <TIME>night</TIME>
-- opposite of the snakes -- and <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> officials concluded
that a bounty would only encourage enterprising entrepreneurs
to start raising snakes commercially.
   <PERSON>Earl Campbell</PERSON>, a researcher with the <ORGANIZATION>Ohio Cooperative Fish</ORGANIZATION>
and <ORGANIZATION>Wildlife Research Unit</ORGANIZATION>, has designed electrified snake
fences that carry 8,000 volts. He says he has sat up <TIME>night
after night</TIME> watching surrounded snakes zap themselves -- and
then zap themselves again. In the long run, though, "the
mortality rate is <PERCENT>70%</PERCENT>," he says. But the fences are expensive
and can only be used in small areas, perhaps such as the
airport and port. They could also be used to create a few
snake-free <PERSON>Edens</PERSON>.
   Great hopes are also being placed on work being done by
<PERSON>Peter Savarie</PERSON>, a Denver-based research pharmacologist with
the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Department of Agriculture</ORGANIZATION>. He says methyl bromide,
in appropriate doses, kills the snakes. But that also could
only be used in small areas, and requires trained personnel.
   A snake-killing virus is one idea, but no one knows yet
which virus would do the trick. Another possibility is using
sex pheromones to attract snakes into a designated "poison
station," where they could be killed off. Great idea, except
no one knows for sure that the snakes are actually attracted
by such sex lures.
   As biologist <PERSON>Fritts</PERSON> says: "Each line of research may have
some place, but no one of them is going to solve the
problem."
   Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION>Guam's Division of Aquatic</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Wildlife
Resources</ORGANIZATION> is pushing its own modest proposal: recipes for
brown tree snake, such as snake meat in coconut milk,
deep-fried snake and sweet-and-sour snake. "I haven't eaten
it personally," says wildlife biologist <PERSON>Michael McCoid</PERSON>, "but
people who have say it's tasty, like" -- you guessed it --
"chicken."

FOUR years ago I spent a couple of days at <LOCATION>Nkamba Bay Lodge</LOCATION>, by the shore of
<LOCATION>Lake Tanganyika</LOCATION>, within <LOCATION>Zambia</LOCATION>'s Sumbu national park. I could have gone
fishing. I did go for game walks, escorted by a guide, <PERSON>Olvitti Chasaya</PERSON>, and
his supremely ancient rifle. What I did not attempt, because of the
crocodiles, was to walk near the lake.
The reason I respect crocodiles is my awareness of the number of people
grabbed in recent years by the fearsome estuarine saltwater crocodiles -
'salties' - of northern <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>. Mainly, estuarine crocs range from
southern <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and the Malay archipelago to <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Sri Lanka</LOCATION>, taking in
<LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New Guinea</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Solomons</LOCATION>. In <LOCATION>Papua New Guinea</LOCATION>
once I asked a tribal chief what to do if chased by a croc. 'Jump in the
river,' he said brusquely. It is possible he was joking.
For a rundown on crocs, alligators and other animal (and insect) hazards
when travelling in tropical parts, you need the latest edition of <ORGANIZATION>The
Tropical Traveller</ORGANIZATION> by <PERSON>John Hatt</PERSON> (<LOCATION>Penguin</LOCATION>, Pounds 6.99).
The writer insists that you should never run from a wild cat. 'Although
terrifying, it is much safer to face them. One acquaintance was charged by a
tiger in <LOCATION>Nepal</LOCATION>. His guide rushed at the tiger, shouting and yelling. The
tiger retreated.' Other tips:
<LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> and hippopotamus are far more dangerous than lions. On <LOCATION>South
Africa</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Natal</ORGANIZATION> coast a cow hippo was once seen to plunge into the sea, seize
a 300lb shark from the surf, haul it on to the beach and trample it to
death.
Piranhas' ferocity, on the other hand, is much exaggerated (says <PERSON>Hatt</PERSON>),
though the red-bellied piranha, common in savanna ponds, can inflict
terrible bites. It is likely that most piranha wounds are caused out of
water. Landed piranhas (fishing boat or river bank) flop about and gnash
their teeth.
Sharks: you are in greatest danger when near a wriggling fish, as
spear-fishermen will confirm. Avoid night-time swimming: some of the most
dangerous species, including the tiger shark, come into the shallows at
night.
Good news about snakes: there are no dangerously venomous snakes in <LOCATION>Ireland</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Iceland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New Zealand</LOCATION>, most of <ORGANIZATION>Polynesia</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Micronesia</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>Galapagos</LOCATION>, the
Canaries, <LOCATION>Malta</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>Orkneys</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Shetlands</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Madagascar</LOCATION> and numerous other
islands. A South African survey showed that 74 per cent of snakebites are
inflicted below the knee, and 67 per cent below the ankle. Lesson: wear
boots and thick trousers. The snake's fangs may penetrate the trousers, but
the amount of venom delivered will be greatly reduced.
Dogs: again, do not run away. Face the dog, look fierce and bend down as if
to pick up a stone. If the dog still threatens, throw a stone at the dog's
(dogs') head(s). Dogs are not only a problem in undeveloped countries. In
the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>, more than 1m dog-bites a year require hospital attention.
Mosquitoes: about 1m people a year die of malaria, but mosquitoes also carry
some 80 other diseases. Insect repellants last far longer on material
(clothes, sheets) than on your skin. Many mosquito species like to bite
ankles, so wear socks doused in repellant. 'This may deter mosquitoes more
than you think,' says <PERSON>John Hatt</PERSON>, 'because many of them begin their
investigations as close to the ground as possible.'
Hatt covers a broad range of subject matter: travel preparations, money
(carrying it, keeping hold of it), equipment, flying, health, transport and
accommodation, culture shock and so forth. There is even an index.
I especially liked his disclaimer: 'The author and publisher have tried to
make the advice and information as accurate as possible, but they accept no
responsibility for loss, injury, inconvenience or other liability arising
from any person using this book.'
Another worthwhile paperback, recently updated, is <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> By Train, by <PERSON>Katie
Wood</PERSON> and <PERSON>George McDonald</PERSON> (<LOCATION>Fontana</LOCATION>, Pounds 7.99). It is packed with
information, some of it otiose, some of it twee, but all of it well
marshalled.

<LEADPARA>  Prescott residents who call themselves the Smoki People no longer will dance
with live snakes in their mouths in an annual rite detested by Indians who
have called it sacrilege.;    Dropping the Indian-style performances staged in
Prescott by the mostly Anglo group every August since 1921, the Smokis instead
will try to persuade Indian tribes to send their own dancers to perform at
events sponsored by the 350-member organization.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The <ORGANIZATION>Smoki Snake Dance</ORGANIZATION>, the highlight of the annual <PERSON>Smoki Ceremonials</PERSON>, was
one of <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>'s oldest non-Indian traditions and long has been a major
tourist attraction.;    "These are changing times," said "Chief Ponytail," a
36-year-old construction contractor elected leader of the Smokis in
<LOCATION>September.</LOCATION>;    <ORGANIZATION>Smoki</ORGANIZATION> tradition prohibits members from using their real names
when talking about the organization.;    "Feelings have been generated against
our dance for some time," Chief Ponytail said.;    For this year, at least,
all imitation Indian dances by <ORGANIZATION>Smoki</ORGANIZATION> members have been canceled, he said.;   
Religious and secular leaders of the <LOCATION>Hopi Tribe</LOCATION>, who demonstrated in Prescott
against the dance last year, hailed the decision as a breakthrough in cultural
understanding.;    Hopi Chairman <PERSON>Vernon Masayesva</PERSON>, who led anti-Smoki
picketing by about 100 tribal members, said <PERSON>Hopis</PERSON> "plan to go to <PERSON>Prescott</PERSON>
again, not to demonstrate, but to show the city our gratitude for hosting us
last year and to thank the <ORGANIZATION>Smoki</ORGANIZATION> for a wise decision.";    Saying that
complaints of sacrilege have arisen sporadically for 15 years, although not
all Indians objected to the dances, Chief Ponytail said, "Probably what our
job will be in the future is promotion.;    "We want to sponsor Indians who
dance. We want to lean toward artwork and basket weaving. But anything we do
will definitely steer away from imitating any religious tradition.";    The
group, whose members bear snakebite tattoos, long had maintained that its
version of the <ORGANIZATION>Snake Dance</ORGANIZATION> gave non-Indians a glimpse of a dying culture. Many
prominent Arizonans have been <ORGANIZATION>Smoki</ORGANIZATION> members through the years, including
former <PERSON>Sen. Barry Goldwater.</PERSON>;    <PERSON>Radford Quamahongnewa</PERSON>, who is snake priest at
the Hopi Reservation village of Shungopavi, called the group's announcement
"very good news.";    Hopis believe that the rattlesnakes their priests dance
with take prayers for rain to the spirit world when they are released at the
end of ceremonies.;    Smokis danced with non-venomous bullsnakes.  </TEXT>

SNAKE BITES THE HAND THAT'S FREEZING IT

<P>
Aveteran snake handler at the <LOCATION>San Diego Zoo</LOCATION> was bitten <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> by a venomous 
mole viper, the first such incident in the zoo's history, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Charles W. Radcliffe</PERSON>, 48, who has worked at the zoo three years and previously 
handled snakes at zoos in <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> and Ft. Worth, <LOCATION>Tex.</LOCATION>, was listed in good 
condition <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> night in the intensive care unit of <ORGANIZATION>UC San Diego Medical 
Center</ORGANIZATION>. Hospital officials said they expect <ORGANIZATION>Radcliffe</ORGANIZATION> to be released <DATE>today</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Zoo spokesman <PERSON>Jeff Jouett</PERSON> said <PERSON>Radcliffe</PERSON> was about to put the mole viper into a 
freezer in preparation for feeding it to a poisonous red-headed krait from 
<LOCATION>Southeast Asia</LOCATION> when he was bitten at <TIME>9:50 a.m.</TIME> <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>. Kraits feed on other 
snakes, <PERSON>Jouett</PERSON> said, noting that the mole viper is one of 20 "feeder" snakes 
that had arrived in a shipment from a private dealer from out of state. 
</P>
<P>
"Our curator of snakes had never seen a mole viper in 29 years," <PERSON>Jouett</PERSON> said. 
"He had to get a magnifying glass and count the scales on its stomach to be 
able to make a positive identification. The 20 snakes, including the mole 
viper, were not identified as to species or whether or not they were venomous. 
In fact, the mole viper looks exactly like two or three other species of 
nonpoisonous snakes." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Jouett</PERSON> said <PERSON>Radcliffe</PERSON> was bitten on the index finger of his right hand, which 
began to "swell and hurt immediately after the bite." <PERSON>Jouett</PERSON> said the zoo keeps 
a well-stocked supply of anti-venom for most poisonous snakes, but has no such 
serum for the mole viper. 
</P>
<P>
Coincidentally, <PERSON>Jouett</PERSON> said the zoo was notified <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> by officials at the 
<LOCATION>Mexico City</LOCATION> Zoo that one of their handlers was bitten by an African puff adder, 
necessitating a shipment of puff adder anti-venom from <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Mexico 
City</LOCATION>, via the <LOCATION>Tijuana</LOCATION> airport. He said <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> police rushed the anti-venom 
to <LOCATION>Tijuana</LOCATION> for the flight out. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Jouett</PERSON> said <PERSON>Radcliffe</PERSON>'s was the second bite a poisonous reptile had inflicted 
on a handler, the first occurring in <DATE>1984</DATE>, when a Gila monster bit two 
handlers. But it was the first time a venomous snake had bitten a handler.

COEXISTING WITH WILDLIFE JUST A MATTER OF TOLERANCE

<TEXT>
<P>
Although the ubiquitous <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION> bulldozers chase many critters away 
forever, other wild animals stay on, somehow managing to survive, even thrive. 
In fact, most of the survivors, while retaining their wildness, also learn to 
take advantage of living close to man. 
</P>
<P>
Skunks often nest in basements, even between walls, and rattlesnakes rest under 
plants or on rocks in the back yard. Raccoons sneak in through cat doors and 
snack on feline food, while coyotes make meals of the felines themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Reactions of human co-habitants range from "Oh, how cute, let's feed it" to 
fright, horror -- even lethal action. The reactions depend not only on the 
sentiments of the people involved, but also the species of wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
Some creatures, such as rattlesnakes, almost always evoke a negative response, 
while others elicit mixed or sympathetic feelings. Many of the species regarded 
as nuisances are the very ones that thrive in our midst. 
</P>
<P>
"Coyotes, raccoons, skunks, starlings, sparrows and pigeons are preadapted to 
man-modified habitats," says <PERSON>Douglas Bolger</PERSON>, a graduate student in biology at 
<LOCATION>UC San Diego</LOCATION>. "They have evolved in an environment like that created by man." 
</P>
<P>
Although few people yearn for a world without wild animals, most city folks 
don't know what to do when confronted with rabbits in the ranunculus or bats in 
the belfry. Guided by common sense and tolerance, most <LOCATION>North County</LOCATION> residents 
can peacefully coexist with the remaining wild creatures. 
</P>
<P>
"For the past four years, the Humane Society of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> has been 
conducting seminars on humane solutions to problems with urban wildlife," said 
<PERSON>John Grandy</PERSON>, the society's vice president for wildlife. "The seminars have 
become remarkably popular, because everyone has problems." 
</P>
<P>
The Humane Society will publish a book on the subject this <DATE>fall</DATE>. In the 
meantime, <PERSON>Grandy</PERSON> and local experts have both philosophical and practical 
advice. 
</P>
<P>
"We first try to impart tolerance, since many of the problems are attitudinal," 
<PERSON>Grandy</PERSON> said. "People, like the king of <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>, think their home, including 
their yard, is their castle -- where they have the inalienable right to do 
whatever they want. They want to plant corn in the middle of a family of 
raccoons and not have the raccoons eat it." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he recommends that people learn to think like the animal they're 
trying to control and look for compassionate solutions. 
</P>
<P>
"The first reaction does not have to be lethal," <PERSON>Grandy</PERSON> said. "That should be a 
last resort." 
</P>
<P>
Project Wildlife, a rescue group, is often called when a wild animal appears at 
the patio window. Volunteers such as <PERSON>Ray West</PERSON>, the group's education chairman 
and vice president for communications, will first ask if pet food is left 
outside overnight. 
</P>
<P>
"That's usually the key," he said. "Almost all these animals are nocturnal and 
forage for food after dark. If they find an easy source, they come and get it. 
The answer then is not to leave the pet food out." 
</P>
<P>
The critter in question will quickly realize this source of food has dried up 
and search elsewhere. People who deliberately feed wild animals cause even more 
problems, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The animals become dependent," West said. "This may even cost a young animal, 
one which is learning its hunting skills, the opportunity to develop." 
</P>
<P>
The feeding usually backfires because the animals hang around and become bolder 
than normal. A <LOCATION>Poway</LOCATION> family discovered this phenomenon after watching a coyote 
give birth. Fascinated by the daily drama as the mother raised her young, they 
started putting out food. They were less fascinated when the grown litter began 
showing up on their lawn in broad daylight, looking for food. 
</P>
<P>
The family contacted the city of <LOCATION>Poway</LOCATION>, which in turn called in an 
extermination company. The company recommended that the coyotes be captured in 
leg-hold traps and shot. Project Wildlife rescuers persuaded the city that far 
better alternatives existed. Their advice: If the family stopped feeding the 
coyotes, the coyotes would go away. This common-sense, humane solution solved 
the problem in less than two months. 
</P>
<P>
"Just as we discourage people from feeding wild animals, we also discourage 
them from taking animals out of the wild and trying to raise them," <PERSON>West</PERSON> said. 
"For one thing, each species needs a specific diet. Also, if an animal becomes 
imprinted on people, it can never safely be returned to the wild." 
</P>
<P>
Like all the rescue groups in the county, Project Wildlife rehabilitates sick, 
young and injured animals with the goal of returning them to the wild. But 
sometimes that is impossible. How can a barn owl -- captured as a baby and fed 
a steady diet of bologna, bacon and hamburger -- be released? Malnutrition 
permanently deformed its talons and feet and left it unable to hunt, or even 
perch. What about the bobcat that was neutered and declawed and lived in an 
apartment? It now exists in a limbo somewhere between tame and wild. 
</P>
<P>
There is also the opposite reaction to contact with wild animals. Instead of 
wanting to take animals home, some people simply want to kill them. A 
surprising number of the animals that rescue groups encounter have been shot, 
poisoned or otherwise deliberately hurt. 
</P>
<P>
Most people, however, are willing to do anything within reason to get along 
with their wild neighbors. <ORGANIZATION>Diana Aguirre of Wildlife Center</ORGANIZATION> has a number of 
suggestions for controlling "nuisance" animals: 
</P>
<P>
* For skunks nesting under a house, install a one-way dog door, so the skunk 
can get out but not back in. In the meantime, close up all other openings. 
</P>
<P>
* To keep birds and other creatures out of a chimney, cover the top of the 
chimney with a chimney cap. 
</P>
<P>
* To prevent birds from crashing into plate-glass windows, put up hawk 
silhouettes to scare them away. 
</P>
<P>
* Keep cats inside, especially at night, so they don't become easy prey for 
coyotes. 
</P>
<P>
(This will also save small, wild creatures from felines. Bolger says the 
usually dynamic relationship between prey and predator is upset by what he 
calls a "subsidized predator," one that is fed by humans and can kill wildlife 
at its leisure.) 
</P>
<P>
* Put fiberglass or metal strips around trees so opossums cannot climb up and 
eat the fruit. 
</P>
<P>
* Put up small fences or wrap chicken wire around stakes pounded into the 
ground to keep rabbits from devouring a garden. 
</P>
<P>
* If pigeons and starlings befoul cars parked under trees, either park 
elsewhere or trim trees in late fall. "Trimming at that time will make the 
trees less habitable for the birds during nesting season," said <PERSON>Aguirre</PERSON>. Also, 
it's better for the trees themselves, because they're dormant at that time. 
</P>
<P>
While pigeons and starlings may be an irritant, few creatures evoke the fear 
and dread that rattlesnakes and bats do. In <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>, they also have a few 
fierce and knowledgeable defenders. 
</P>
<P>
Contrary to popular opinion, rattlesnakes (the only indigenous poisonous snake 
in the county) present only a minor problem, said <PERSON>Richard Plock</PERSON>, president of 
the <ORGANIZATION>Herpetological Society</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>. Even when bitten, most people recover 
completely if they receive prompt treatment. About 10 people die a year from 
snakebites in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, and most were either handling or otherwise 
fooling around with the snakes, according to <ORGANIZATION>Plock</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people think that all rattlesnakes want to do is lie in wait and bite, 
but that's not true," he said. "The only reason a snake strikes is because it 
feels trapped or that it is being attacked. Given the opportunity, it will get 
away from people." 
</P>
<P>
When residents find rattlesnakes in their yards, <ORGANIZATION>Plock</ORGANIZATION> said, they should either 
leave them alone -- on the assumption they are only resting and will move along 
if allowed an escape route -- or follow this procedure: Turn a large garbage 
can on its side, push or chase the snake into the can with a long broom, place 
the cover on the can and release the snake elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Rattlesnakes play a beneficial role in nature, but they are often killed by 
people who come upon them, along with other helpful, nonpoisonous snakes that 
are mistaken for rattlers. Plock says gopher snakes (which help control the 
rodent population, as do rattlesnakes) are most often the victims of mistaken 
identity. 
</P>
<P>
Bats also have their defenders, such as <PERSON>Martin Schuler</PERSON>, one of a small group of 
volunteers involved in the <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> Bat Conservation group. 
</P>
<P>
"It's important to understand that bats have a place in the scheme of things," 
<PERSON>Schuler</PERSON> said. "They eat 500 to 600 insects in an hour and consume five or six 
times their body weight in one night." 
</P>
<P>
He cites two reasons for fear of bats: rabies and misunderstanding. At dusk, 
when bats come out to feed, they swoop down to catch insects. People sitting 
around a campfire or on their porch swing often assume the darting creatures 
are after them, not bugs. 
</P>
<P>
"As for the fear of rabies, people need to know that if they find any kind of 
dead or sick animal, they should leave it alone," said <PERSON>Schuler</PERSON>, who has studied 
bats for 20 years. "If you find a nocturnal animal crawling around during the 
day, it's important to realize that that's abnormal behavior and that the 
animal is probably sick or hurt. Any wild animal which will allow people to 
come near it or to touch it has something wrong with it." 
</P>
<P>
The group's volunteers will pick up grounded bats and give advice on getting 
them out of spaces where they're not wanted. They will also advise people on 
how to attract bats and their insect-controlling skills. 
</P>
<P>
"People who have bats around say they have no insects," <PERSON>Schuler</PERSON> said. "People 
who have lots of insects around may want to try to attract bats by putting up 
bat houses." 
</P>
<P>
Still, most people are more interested in controlling wildlife than attracting 
it. In the vast majority of cases, this can be accomplished by taking care not 
to create a desirable habitat for an undesirable species. The last non-lethal 
resort should be humane trapping, wildlife advocates say. Although the <ORGANIZATION>Humane 
Society</ORGANIZATION> and other animal welfare groups discourage trapping and the relocation 
of wildlife, sometimes no alternative exists. 
</P>
<P>
A variety of cage or box traps, such as those used to capture feral cats, are 
available. Typically, these are designed so that a trap door closes as soon as 
the animal enters the chamber. The Humane Society recommends that animals be 
released within their home range if at all possible. 
</P>
<P>
Humane trapping is one of the methods used by <ORGANIZATION>Critter Control</ORGANIZATION>, a national 
company with offices in <LOCATION>San Diego County</LOCATION>. While most pest-management companies 
still rely on extermination, <ORGANIZATION>Critter Control</ORGANIZATION> uses ecologically sound methods 
whenever possible. 
</P>
<P>
Critter Control's <PERSON>Jim Byers</PERSON> said the company was started <DATE>several years ago</DATE>, 
partly in response to budget cuts that curtailed state and local governments' 
abilities to deal with wildlife complaints. Besides removing animals, Critter 
Control repairs damage and installs devices such as chimney caps to keep 
wildlife from returning. 
</P>
<P>
Attitude changes advocated by the <ORGANIZATION>Humane Society</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Grandy</PERSON> could make trapping 
even less necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, it's more important to have animals than a picture-perfect yard," said 
<PERSON>Grandy</PERSON>. "The alternative is sterility, life without the song of a bird and the 
yip of a coyote." 
</P>
<P>
He notes that there is very little left in <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION> that could be 
called natural and asks if "freeways, pollution and pesticides are natural?" 
</P>
<P>
To keep what remains wild and natural, humans must create corridors for 
wildlife, said <PERSON>Ted Case</PERSON>, a biology professor at <ORGANIZATION>UCSD</ORGANIZATION>. Isolating wildlife in 
fragmented canyons has caused extinction, he said. "In order to preserve what's 
left, we shouldn't just be setting aside little pieces; we need to leave 
connections." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Barbara Bamberger</PERSON>, conservation coordinator for the <ORGANIZATION>Sierra Club</ORGANIZATION>, says it is not 
too late to create such wild corridors in <LOCATION>North County</LOCATION>. The alternative is the 
loss of an increasing number of species. 
</P>
<P>
"Species become extinct before we even know what effect their loss will have," 
<PERSON>Bamberger</PERSON> said. "It's like the human body -- when you take away an arm, the 
body still works, but not as well."

   The <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION>, trying to save a <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION>
snake-venom researcher who was bitten by a rare snake, searched
remote corners of the globe for serum and then used <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> government
contacts <DATE>Friday</DATE> to speed the medicine to his bedside.
   Two badly needed serums were located in out-of-the way parts of
<LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>, and with the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> getting the
<ORGANIZATION>Customs Service</ORGANIZATION> to waive normal clearance rules, were en route to
<LOCATION>Salt Lake City</LOCATION> late <DATE>Friday</DATE>.
   <PERSON>William Haast</PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION>Miami Serpentarium Laboratories</ORGANIZATION> at the
<ORGANIZATION>University of Utah's Research Park</ORGANIZATION>, maintains 1,000 exotic,
poisonous snakes at the lab, which provides venom to health
organizations and others for research and use in manufacturing
anti-venins.
   The 78-year-old man had been bitten nearly 150 times previously,
and he thought he had built up immunity. Haast evidently did not
initially consider <DATE>Thursday</DATE>'s bite by a Pakistani pit viper to be
serious.
   But he became ill and was in serious condition <DATE>Friday</DATE> at the
<ORGANIZATION>University of Utah Health Sciences Center</ORGANIZATION>, awaiting the rare serums
that could give him a full recovery.
   He already has been treated with massive doses of antivenin,
including a shipment the <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION> hospital obtained through an unusual
airport relay involving a <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> zoo, a helicopter and a <ORGANIZATION>Delta
Air Lines</ORGANIZATION> jetliner.
   <PERSON>Stephen Studdert</PERSON>, a special assistant to President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>, said he
got a call <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> from an associate of <LOCATION>Haast</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Studdert</PERSON>, who is from <LOCATION>Salt Lake City</LOCATION>, had given a speech there
recently describing <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s ``kinder, gentler'' approach to human
problems. An associate of <LOCATION>Haast</LOCATION> read an account of his speech,
<PERSON>Studdert</PERSON> said, and called for help <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>.
   <PERSON>Studdert</PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> switchboard relayed the call to his
home, and the associate, whom he did not identify, ``asked how we
could help. The serum could not be located in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>,
only in <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>.''
   The presidential aide said he immediately set up conference calls
with people around the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and in other countries. He said
doctors and other specialists advised the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> that the
serums Haast needed were not available in this country.
   What then transpired is an unusual joint-effort involving people
in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>, with planes rushing
for clearance and being met on airport runways by <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> government
emissaries seeking to protect the serum and get it delivered.
   Over the next several hours, <PERSON>Studdert</PERSON> said in an interview, he
arranged through <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> government, medical and other private sources
for ``people-to-people, non-government'' contacts in <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> and direct
government contacts between the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>.
   Using an American interpreter who speaks <LOCATION>Farsi</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Studdert</PERSON> put
<LOCATION>Haast</LOCATION>'s representatives in telephone contact with serum specialists
in <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION>, who located one of the necessary serums about two hours
from <LOCATION>Tehran</LOCATION>.
   Studdert explained that two different serums were needed _ one
for young Pakistani pit vipers and another one for the older snakes
of the same kind.
   Then, he said, he put <PERSON>Billy Dale</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> transportation
office official, to work organizing the flight routes for delivering
the serums.
   Vials of the Iranian serum were flown by <LOCATION>Luththansa</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION>,
where the flight was met by representatives of the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Consul
General</ORGANIZATION>'s office and then transferred on an <ORGANIZATION>Air France</ORGANIZATION> flight to
<LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>. The vial was then to be flown to <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Kennedy Airport</LOCATION>,
picked up by a federal <ORGANIZATION>Drug Enforcement Administration</ORGANIZATION> helicopter
and flown to <LOCATION>LaGuardia</LOCATION> and put on an <LOCATION>America West</LOCATION> flight scheduled
to arrive in <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION> <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME>.
   Subsequently, <PERSON>Studdert</PERSON> and his colleagues located the second
serum _ the one for younger Pakistani pit vipers _ at the <ORGANIZATION>English
National Poison Unit</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, and that a <ORGANIZATION>British Airways</ORGANIZATION> flight
was headed from <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> with that package.
   ``Doctors are going to go ahead and administer the serum from the
<LOCATION>London</LOCATION> young-snake unit,'' he said.
   In addition, another supply of the necessary serum was obtained
with through the <ORGANIZATION>Tashkent Institute of Vaccines</ORGANIZATION>, working
cooperatively with the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> through the <ORGANIZATION>Soviet Institute of
Health</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Studdert</PERSON> said. That serum was put on an <ORGANIZATION>Aeroflot</ORGANIZATION> flight from
<LOCATION>Tashkent</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> and was being flown to <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION> for eventual
shipment to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>.
   ``When I decided I should get involved, I clearly did not want to
disturb the president,'' <PERSON>Studdert</PERSON> said. ``But I decided, this is
what the president would have wanted us to do.''
   ``We're not in the business of transporting pharmaceuticals,'' he
said. ``But this was a case where the medical solution was not
available in this country and we were happy to be able to play a
role.''

<HL> Bangladesh Gets $236 Million in Aid For Flood Relief </HL>

<TEXT>
   Flood waters began to recede <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, and the government said it has received <MONEY>$236 million</MONEY> in aid to fight the destruction and disease caused by recent floods. 

   Thousands of lives were threatened by diarrhea caused by drinking water contaminated with sewage and garbage washed up by raging flood waters, health officials said. 

   More than 200,000 people have contracted the disease and at least 123 have died from it, said the officials, who requested anonymity. 
The disease kills by dehydration. 

   As river levels began to fall after two weeks of flooding, many residents returned to their homes, said officials at the <ORGANIZATION>Flood Control Center</ORGANIZATION>. 
They said they expect the water level to soon begin to drop quickly. 

   The floods covered three-quarters of the nation and 53 of the country's 64 districts, with a population of 30 million, said Information Minister <PERSON>Mahbubur Rahman</PERSON>. 

   He said 866 people have died of drowning, snakebites and disease. 
The government figure is considered low, and newspapers estimate at least 1,532 people have died. 

   "The world has responded promptly and generously to our appeal for help to the flood victims," <PERSON>Mr. Rahman</PERSON> said. 

   He said the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> pledged <MONEY>$150 million</MONEY> in aid on <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, in addition to <MONEY>$2.6 million</MONEY> committed earlier. 
More funds and relief supplies have arrived from <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>European Economic Community</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Saudi Arabia</LOCATION>, among others, he said. 

   The <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> has offered 100 tents, 1,000 blankets and 100 tons of medicine, he said. 

   <PERSON>Danielle Mitterrand</PERSON>, wife of the French President <PERSON>Francois Mitterrand</PERSON>, will visit the flood-affected areas during her four-day tour. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Rahman</PERSON> estimated the damage from flooding would exceed <MONEY>$1.4 billion</MONEY> and that 6,000 to 10,000 tons of grains stored in warehouses were damaged or destroyed by water. 

   The government of <PERSON>Hussain Muhammad Ershad</PERSON> is struggling with a shortage of helicopters and boats to get food and medicine to people stranded in the countryside. 

   Hundreds of volunteer organizations, many run by Christian missionaries, are aiding in the relief effort, but reporters have visited areas where the first relief supplies didn't arrive until <DATE>Saturday</DATE>. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Rahman</PERSON> said, however, that the country has enough food to meet immediate needs and that the government would ensure "that nobody dies of starvation during the floods."

Rounding Up Rattlers: A Town Tradition

<TEXT>
   Three men moved slowly along the lip of the canyon, their shadows falling below them, stretching long and dark across a long meadow carpeted in lush green grass and dotted with crimson <ORGANIZATION>Hereford</ORGANIZATION> cattle grazing peacefully in the early morning sun. 

   Eyes on the ground, each man peered into the crevices and recesses of the white, porous gypsum boulders and into the inner depths of the scattered scrub brush that sprouts near the break where canyon meets plateau. 

   <PERSON>Anthony Felder</PERSON>, the leader of the three, parted the leaved branches of a stubby wild plum and was the first to find the object of their quest. 
"There's one here," announced <PERSON>Mr. Felder</PERSON>, "but I doubt we'll get it. 
All I can see is about the last six inches sticking out of a hole." 

   The three converged on the spot, planned a strategy and went to work. 
Using yard-long metal rods equipped with controllable, grasping tongs, each hunter scrambled to grasp his prey. 

   The battle went undecided for several tense minutes before <PERSON>Virgil Pugh</PERSON> announced, "I've got him. . . . 
Everybody stand back." 
<PERSON>Mr. Pugh</PERSON> lifted hard, swinging his catch over his head. 
Turning, he deposited 3 1/2 feet of wrist-thick, enraged diamondback rattlesnake onto a slab of ivory gypsum. 

   The men stood for a few minutes and admired the coiled snake. 
<PERSON>Mr. Pugh</PERSON> took time to show the newcomer of the three the clear yellow venom that streaked down his catcher from the snake's repeated strikes. 

   Eventually, <PERSON>Mr. Pugh</PERSON> pinned the diamond's head to the rock with the metal instrument, grasped it between his thumb and forefinger and barehanded the twisting snake into a pillowcase. 
The excitement behind them, the hunt went on. 

   "This is my 24th year," said <PERSON>Mr. Pugh</PERSON>, a speech pathologist from <LOCATION>Colwich</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kan</LOCATION>. 
"I started it as a dare but you can get hooked. 
I take a week's vacation and come down here to hunt with friends. 
It's kind of like a class reunion. 
But I guess the thrill of it is what attracts me. 
These things can be hazardous to your health." 

   But rattlesnake hunting is more than just a sport for a courageous few around this tiny central <LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION> town. 
It is a tradition. 

   "I guess I've been hunting rattlesnakes for 46 years, since I was 14, and that's probably true of about every kind around," said <PERSON>Mr. Felder</PERSON>, a lifelong resident. 
"It's part of a tradition. 
Big brother did it, Dad did it and most kids naturally want to get out and try to find a snake bigger than they did." 

   According to <PERSON>Mr. Felder</PERSON>, the gypsum canyons that lie in the petroleum and ranching country west of town offer optimum habitat for Western diamondback rattlesnakes. 
The poisonous reptiles thrive thanks to the little caverns that sound hollow underfoot and reach far back from the lips of the canyons. 

   Local hunters, such as <PERSON>Mr. Felder</PERSON>, know the locations of such dens and hunt the area around their usually small openings. 
During the course of a year the best dens produce an amazing number of snakes. 

   "During the average day it's not too uncommon not to catch any snakes but it's not uncommon to catch as many as 14 or 15," said <PERSON>Mr. Felder</PERSON>. 
"I've had days when two of us have caught as many as 40 from just a few dens. 
The most I know of coming from one den, at one time, is somewhere over 30. but you can go to these same dens the next day and still catch more snakes." 

   A new season begins with the first tepid afternoons of <DATE>January</DATE> when the rattlers slither to the surface to warm in the sun, and lasts until the heat of <DATE>summer</DATE> forces the cold-blooded creatures to be nocturnal. 

   The town that locals affectionately refer to as "Okeene America" remains mostly ambivalent toward the hunts most of the year. 

   On a recent <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME>, regulars gathered at The Galvanized Palace, talking of things common to towns of 1,300. 
Outside the tavern teen-agers, fresh from school, cruised the three-block business district, exchanging waves with friends and strangers alike. 

   And things would be the same the following <DATE>Monday</DATE>, but not so during the two days in between. 
Two blocks of Main Street would be roped off, concessionaires would line the sidewalks and an estimated 5,000 people would come to attend the 47th Okeene Rattlesnake Round-Up. 
Sponsored by the local Jaycees, the Round-Up draws people from nearly two dozen states as well as an occasional foreign country. 

   Some come for hunting, renting equipment and following local guides into the canyon country where they search for, and usually find, rattlesnakes. 
But more than <PERCENT>90%</PERCENT> of those who attend come only as spectators drawn by the unusual. 

   For them there are the stands, selling an assortment of rattlesnake products ranging from <MONEY>$1</MONEY> rattles to <MONEY>$300</MONEY> boots, and the carnival-like snake shows. 
And there are the cornmeal-coated "snake steaks" that one newcomer rated as having "a good flavor but not much meat," as she rolled the bony skeleton between her fingers. 

   Admittedly, many come for the mystery and the danger that surround the creatures. 
People stand seemingly spellbound as handlers measure and auction off the largest of the entries, snakes that come from both local dens and from across the South, routinely measuring five and six feet in length. 

   At times spectators pack "the butcher shop" where Jaycees turn live rattlesnakes into packaged meat as well as souvenir heads, skins and rattles. 

   The main event of the Round-Up is officially billed "The Den of Death," but locals call it "the pit." 
They're talking about an enclosure made from eight sheets of plywood and filled with several hundred rattling snakes. 
Spectators line the perimeter, watching handlers such as Messrs. 
<PERSON>Felder</PERSON> and <PERSON>Pugh</PERSON> pick up and show off the reptiles. 
It is here where most of the danger lies. 

   "Nearly all of the bites that occur happen in the pit," said <PERSON>Mr. Felder</PERSON>, taking a break from a turn with the snakes. 
"You say it'll happen to somebody else but it's inevitable. 
I've been bitten twice but some guys get it a lot more than that. 

   "Our wives have to be super ladies to put up with what we do," continued <PERSON>Mr. Felder</PERSON>, a religious and dedicated family man. 
"Now I know how my parents must have felt. 
My 18-year-old son has been getting into the pit for two years. 
There were three bites at a roundup in <LOCATION>Sweetwater</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, this year. 
One of them died -- he was only 20 years old." 

   Later that day the younger <PERSON>Felder</PERSON> did get hit by a striking snake. 
Luckily, the venomous fangs didn't penetrate the legs of his jeans. 
"That's probably the best thing that could have happened to him," commented the father. 
"It'll give him a whole new respect for the snakes. 
It's probably postponed his getting bit for another five years."

   A herpetologist bitten by a deadly viper a

   <PERSON>William Haast</PERSON>, 78, has been bitten by snakes 148 times during his
career as a venom researcher. He has built up immunity to the venom
of dozens of snakes, but became ill after being bitten on the hand
<DATE>Feb. 28</DATE> by a Pakistani pit viper.
   After treatment with antivenin flown in from the <LOCATION>San Diego Zoo</LOCATION>
was less effective than expected, a worldwide effort was launched,
with the help of the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration, to obtain more antivenin.
   Serums came from <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>, but were not
used because doctors feared possible side effects and because <LOCATION>Haast</LOCATION>
appeared finally to be recovering.
   ``He will contintue to be treated and seen by physicians on an
out-patient basis,'' hospital spokesman <PERSON>John Dwan</PERSON> said.
   Haast is director of the <ORGANIZATION>Miami Serpentarium Laboratories</ORGANIZATION> at the
university's nearby research park. He keeps an estimated 1,000
poisonous snakes at the lab, where venom is extracted for research
and the manufacture of antivenins.

   A 78-year-old snake researcher bitten by a
deadly viper last week was released from the hospital and has
returned to his laboratory.
   <PERSON>William Haast</PERSON>, whose illness touched off an international effort
to find antivenin to save him, was released <DATE>Wednedsay</DATE>.
   He said the Pakistani pit viper was only defending itself,
blaming the bite on his own carelessness. It was the 148th time he
had been bitten during his career as a researcher and the 19th time
he was hospitalized.
   ``They have a reputation for striking out,'' he said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
``They can reach out from the ground over two feet.''
   Haast was bitten <DATE>Feb. 28</DATE>. Because he did not expect the reaction
to be as serious as it was, he did not enter the <ORGANIZATION>University of Utah
Health Sciences Center</ORGANIZATION> until the following day.
   He was treated with antivenin flown in from <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> when it
was discovered he was allergic to the serum on hand.
   Through the efforts of a <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> aide, more serums were
obtained from <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>, from the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> and even from private
sources in <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION>. But in the end, the serums from overseas were not
used because doctors feared possible side effects and because <LOCATION>Haast</LOCATION>
appeared to be recovering.
   <PERSON>Haast</PERSON> said the people who sent in the antivenins were ``the real
heroes of this story.''
   He is director of the <ORGANIZATION>Miami Serpentarium Laboratories</ORGANIZATION> at the

   A patch of the <ORGANIZATION>Mojave
Desert</ORGANIZATION> will be open for anyone who wants to watch Discovery land
<DATE>Monday</DATE>, but spectators will have to endure traffic jams, chemical
toilets _ and maybe even rattlesnakes.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> expects 100,000 to 200,000 visitors at the viewing site on
the hard clay east shore of <ORGANIZATION>Rogers Dry Lake</ORGANIZATION>, where the space
shuttle is scheduled to touch down at <TIME>9:33 a.m. PDT</TIME>, said <PERSON>Nancy
Lovato</PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the space agency.
   The record crowd for a landing was the estimated 500,000 people
who joined President <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> in witnessing the <DATE>July 4, 1982</DATE>, landing
of <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION> on a paved runway at this military base 80 miles
northeast of <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>.
   This time <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON> will attend, in his capacity as vice
president, not as the Republican presidential candidate, his aides
emphatically told <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION>
spokesman <PERSON>Ralph Jackson</PERSON>.
   The viewing site opens 24 hours before the landing. Jackson
predicted heavy traffic along the desert highways, ``And remember,
all the <ORGANIZATION>Air Police</ORGANIZATION> fellows out there got radar.''
   <PERSON>Lovato</PERSON> said the worst traffic jams will occur before dawn. <PERSON>Haley</PERSON>
said all gates to <ORGANIZATION>Edwards Air Force Base</ORGANIZATION> will be closed to the
general public, and access to the east shore viewing site _ which
doesn't require a vehicle pass or entry through any of the gates _
will be halted one hour before the landing.
   ``No gasoline is available at the viewing site,'' a <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> fact
sheet advised. ``No shelter from the sun will be available. No
telephones will be available. No plumbing or electricity will be
available. No dumping facilities for RV toilets will be available.''
   However, dozens of portable, chemical toilets already have been
placed on the lakeshore viewing site. Very little water or food
will be available, so spectators are advised to bring their own.
   The fact sheet also warned: ``Rattlesnakes are present and must
be respected.''
   ``People can camp out there, and if they have a recreational
vehicle, they'd be well advised to do that,'' <PERSON>Lovato</PERSON> said.
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> will watch the landing from the roof of <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s building
here or from a ramp by <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s hangar, which <PERSON>Lovato</PERSON> said also has
been invaded by rattlers at times.
   As for the general public, ``Somebody who wanders out of where
they're supposed to be into the hills behind the viewing site could
encounter some rattlesnakes,'' <PERSON>Haley</PERSON> said.
   But he said he's not aware of any snakebite victims among
spectators at past shuttle landings.
   ``Usually with all the people and vehicles, there's so much
noise the snakes stay away,'' <PERSON>Lovato</PERSON> said.

<BYLINE>By HARI S. MANIAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BIDOR, Malaysia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's snake blood, not snake oil, but the
Bidor Snake Shop says it cures the same aches, arthritis, asthma,
acne and mysterious maladies of a sexual nature.
   The proprietor, <PERSON>Loi Chee Long</PERSON>, sells the blood of cobras and
other poisonous snakes to those who find his shop in this jungle
town 90 miles north of <LOCATION>Kuala Lumpur</LOCATION> and can pay the fee of up to
<MONEY>$120</MONEY>.
   Customers buy the snake, then Loi kills it and drains the blood,
mixing it with brandy for taste and wallop.
   Most of his customers are from <LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION>, but some
tourists drop in from <LOCATION>Korea</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> and there
is the occasional Western curiosity-seeker.
   ``The white man comes, but I think it is all too disgusting to
him,'' said <PERSON>Loi</PERSON>, 27. ``He inquires about the whole thing with great
enthusiasm, but when we ask him to have a drink he says `Not for
me, thanks.'''
   As he spoke, Loi had a firm grip on the neck of a cobra longer
than he was. Loi is about 5 ft. tall and the reptile's tail
thrashed the ground.
   The commotion continued while he explained calmly that people
drink snake blood because it can cure ``rheumatism, body aches and
skin diseases, improve the eyesight and increase your sexual
prowess, among other things.''
   He said a snake's venom is in its mouth and the blood contains
no poison.
   Loi explained the procedure like a surgeon conducting class:
   ``I hold the snake by the neck, find the main blood vessels on
the underside, slit them with a sharp knife and gather the blood in
the glass.
   ``Pieces of the snake's gallbladder are thrown in and an equal
amount of brandy is added. The brandy is to give the whole thing a
kick as you drink it. Beer and stout won't give that.
   ``This drinking cobra blood is nothing new. The Chinese have
been doing it for years.''
   With his free hand, he plucked a snake from another cage.
   ``Am I scared?'' he said. ``No. I have been catching snakes
since I left school at the age of 16.
   ``At first I used to creep quietly behind the snake, hold its
head with a stick and grab it by the neck and dump it into a cage.
Now I just grab it by the neck. After so many years, it would be
amateurish to use the stick.''
   He has never been bitten, <PERSON>Loi</PERSON> said, because he is a professional
snake catcher whose rule is: ``Your hand grabbing the neck has to
be quicker than the cobra's head to bite you.''
   Other professional catchers in Bidor include <PERSON>Wai Kwan Yang</PERSON>, his
partner in the shop, and Lim Ah Ha, who was listening to the
interview, <PERSON>Loi</PERSON> said.
   They take no antidote with them on hunting forays ``because the
doctor says it is illegal for us to carry such medicine around,''
he said, but ``we carry a small knife. If I am bitten I would cut
the area, drain the blood and rush to a doctor.
   ``We catch only poisonous snakes like the cobra, black cobra,
king cobra and pit vipers because only their blood will have the
proper effect.''
   About 30 to 50 people come to the shop for blood every month,
which <PERSON>Loi</PERSON> said was healthy traffic considering the price.
   ``To buy a cobra or some other poisonous snake ... would cost
between 100 and 300 ringgits (<MONEY>$40</MONEY> to <MONEY>$120</MONEY>), and that is a lot of
money considering that a long snake would only yield about six to
eight tablespoons of blood,'' he said. ``One snake is enough only
for one drink.''

   A researcher who maintains 1,000 venomous

<DATE>Thursday</DATE> after being bitten by a deadly <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> pit viper, his
148th snake bite.
   <PERSON>William E. Haast</PERSON>, 78, director of the <ORGANIZATION>Miami Serpentarium

   Haast drove himself to the hospital, but doctors were not
immediately able to administer anti-venin because <PERSON>Haast</PERSON> was allergic

   <PERSON>Dwan</PERSON> said <PERSON>Haast</PERSON> told him it was the 148th time he'd been bitten
by a snake.
   The 40-year-old <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> Serpentarium originated the concept of

   Rural Texans stubbornly stayed by their homes as
the <LOCATION>Trinity River</LOCATION> _ swollen from the worst northern <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> flooding
in more than 80 years _ rolled southward toward the <LOCATION>Gulf of Mexico</LOCATION>
today.
   Elsewhere, a reservoir on the <LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION> line began falling after
hitting a record of more than 27 feet above normal, and snakebites
were on the rise in <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION>, where flooding has forced the
evacuation of more than 300 homes and driven the reptiles from
nesting areas.
   The <LOCATION>Arkansas River</LOCATION> hit a record 27.6 feet _ 3.6 feet above flood
stage _ today at Little Rock.
   Thirteen deaths have been blamed on the weather in the past two
weeks, one in <LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION> and the rest in <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>.
   <LOCATION>Northern Texas</LOCATION> has had 22.06 inches of rainfall in the <DATE>first
four months of 1990</DATE>, the most since <DATE>1922</DATE>. The result: the worst
flooding since <DATE>1908</DATE>.
   Light rain fell today in eastern <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> and there was a chance of
thunderstorms in the <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> area <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, but <ORGANIZATION>National Weather
Service</ORGANIZATION> meteorologist <PERSON>John Cockrell</PERSON> said that should not compound
the already severe flooding.
   In <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, flood warnings for people and livestock were issued
for today as the <LOCATION>Trinity River</LOCATION> engulfed homes, pastures and fields
south of <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION>.
   At least 150 people were evacuated and main roads closed in
<LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION>, 60 miles southeast of <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION>. Near Palestine, 90 miles
below <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION>, about 50 homes were destroyed or severely damaged in
the community of <LOCATION>Long Lake</LOCATION>, where the <ORGANIZATION>Trinity</ORGANIZATION>, usually a few
hundred feet across, had bulged to about two miles.
   ``We can't tell exactly how many residences are affected yet,
because we can't count underwater,'' said <PERSON>Bill Walters</PERSON>, manager of
a <ORGANIZATION>Red Cross</ORGANIZATION> shelter set up in a campground.
   While about 80 people had been evacuated from <LOCATION>Long Lake</LOCATION> by late
<DATE>Monday</DATE>, many were reluctant to leave, <PERSON>Walters</PERSON> said. ``These people
are pretty stubborn, as all Texans are. They think they can stick
it out, but they really can't do it,'' he said.
   As the flooding moved downstream, the <ORGANIZATION>Red Cross</ORGANIZATION> sent teams to
prepare shelters. Many farm-to-market roads and some major highways
were closed.
   <LOCATION>Lake Texoma</LOCATION> on the <LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION> line fell half a foot <DATE>Monday</DATE> after
cresting at a record 644.76 feet above sea level, the first time
since <DATE>1957</DATE> that water flowed out the spillways.
   <PERSON>Mike McCoy</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Army Corps of Engineers</ORGANIZATION> said will take up to
two months for the lake to return to a ``decent'' level as the
<ORGANIZATION>Corps</ORGANIZATION> plans to lower i by 6 to 9 inches a day.
   A preliminary survey <DATE>Sunday</DATE> found 83 homes at least partially
submerged in <LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Marshall County</LOCATION>, which is partly cut off
from the outside by the swollen lake.
   Highway flooding made life strange for <PERSON>Judy Peterson</PERSON>, who works
in <LOCATION>Madill</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Okla</LOCATION>.
   Instead of simply driving the 18 miles from her home on Sand
Point to the office, she and her husband must take a boat a
half-mile and then drive a circuitous 56-mile route around the
northern edge of <LOCATION>Lake Texoma</LOCATION> and back to <PERSON>Madill</PERSON>. They'd been doing
that for a week as of <DATE>Monday</DATE>.
   ``It's really getting old,'' she said.
   In central <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION>, the rising waters of the <LOCATION>Arkansas River</LOCATION>
have driven snakes from their homes. A hospital at <ORGANIZATION>Pine Bluff</ORGANIZATION>,
which normally treats one snakbite victim a week, has treated eight
in the last week. Spokesman <PERSON>Bill Cheatham</PERSON> said most were bitten by
copperheads, but no one was seriously hurt.
   Water was reported up to 3{ feet deep in homes in the Pine Bluff
area.
   Arkansas Gov. <PERSON>Bill Clinton</PERSON> added two more counties to last
week's disaster declaration <DATE>Monday</DATE>, bringing the total to 29. An
estimated 325 houses were evacuated in six counties, officials said.
   Officials said the flooding along the <LOCATION>Arkansas River</LOCATION> was the
worst since a <DATE>1927</DATE> rampage that prompted construction of many of
the levees along the river.

<HEAD>Snake Expert Won't Receive Overseas Antivenins Unless Condition Worsens</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT MIMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A reseacher bitten by a deadly viper has
stabilized and won't receive antivenins obtained from <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>
and the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> with help from the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> unless his
condition worsens, doctors say.
   <PERSON>William E. Haast</PERSON>, 78, remained in serious but stable condition
today at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Utah Health Sciences Center</ORGANIZATION>. Spokesman
<PERSON>John Dwan</PERSON> said <PERSON>Sunday Haast</PERSON> had been moved out of intensive care
into a regular nursing unit.
   ``His condition has not changed,'' <PERSON>Dwan</PERSON> said. ``He's resting
comfortably, and he's had lots of friends visiting him.''
   Haast likely would remain hospitalized for at least two to three
more weeks, <PERSON>Dwan</PERSON> said. He checked into the hospital <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
   Haast, director of the <ORGANIZATION>Miami Serpentarium Laboratories</ORGANIZATION> at the
university's <ORGANIZATION>Research Park</ORGANIZATION>, was bitten <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> on the left hand by a
Pakistani pit viper, also known as a saw-scaled viper.
   Haast has been bitten 148 times by snakes and is immune to the
venom of dozens, but he had no immunity to the viper. It is one of
1,000 poisonous snakes kept at his lab, where venom is extracted for
research and the manufacture of antivenins.
   The serpentologist's case drew the attention of <PERSON>Stephen Studdert</PERSON>,
special assistant to President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>, who coordinated the acquisition
of antivenins from the three countries and expedited their shipment
to <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION>. All the shipments had arrived by <DATE>Sunday</DATE>.
   ``None have been used, because there are sometimes serious
reactions to antivenins and (doctors) don't want to give them to him
unless they have to,'' <PERSON>Dwan</PERSON> explained. The reactions could include
lung and kidney problems, he said.
   Nevertheless, <PERSON>Dwan</PERSON> said ``we want to express our appreciation to
everyone who has worked so hard in obtaining the antivenins.''
   The viper's venom attacks its victim's ability to produce
fibrinogen, an element of blood that regulates coagulation. A lack
of fibrinogen can cause uncontrolled bleeding.
   Haast's fibrinogen level was near zero <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>. Doctors were
replacing it with transfusions and it appeared <PERSON>Haast</PERSON>'s body had
begun to produce the substance.
   His fibrinogen level improved to about one-third of normal by
<DATE>Sunday</DATE>, still ``dangerously low,'' <PERSON>Dwan</PERSON> said.
   Haast had been treated earlier with antivenins from the <LOCATION>San Diego
Zoo</LOCATION> and from a lab in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, but they did not work as well as
expected.
   <PERSON>Studdert</PERSON> said the Iranian government apparently did not interfere
with the shipment of the antivenin despite the strained relations
with the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>. Iranian leader <PERSON>Ayatollah Khomeini</PERSON> has often
called the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> the ``great Satan.''

<HEAD>Latest NYC Hazard - Poisonous Snakes in Pet Shops</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 50 supposedly harmless snakes sold to a
chain of pet stores by a wholesaler turned out to be poisonous, but
the mistake wasn't noticed until some had been sold to the public.
   Venomous Asian water snakes known as Redneck Keelbacks were
mistakenly labeled as harmless garter snakes. Some of the snakes
bought by Petland Discounts were distributed among the company's 50
stores in the metropolitan area.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Health Department</ORGANIZATION> issued a public warning <DATE>Friday</DATE>.
   Afterward, the <ORGANIZATION>ASPCA</ORGANIZATION> picked up five snakes from pet owners who
called for help. Two of them turned out to be Keelbacks.
   In addition, 14 venomous snakes were removed from stores and
taken to the zoo.
   Redneck Keelbacks are not usually aggressive. But a bite can be
fatal if not treated, said <PERSON>Peter Lynn</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Health Department</ORGANIZATION>
spokesman.
   The snakes are about 18 inches long and about as big around ``as
your pinky,'' said <PERSON>Marilynn LeVine</PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION>Bronx Zoo</ORGANIZATION>.
They are orange but look like common North American garter snakes.
   A self-taught snake handler whose discovery of the mistake led
to a tri-state snake alarm said he tried to tell people but
initially no one would listen, <ORGANIZATION>Newsday</ORGANIZATION> reported <DATE>Sunday</DATE>.
   ``But they believe me now,'' said <PERSON>Tom Robertson Jr</PERSON>.
   <PERSON>Robertson</PERSON> was in a <ORGANIZATION>Petland Discount</ORGANIZATION> store in <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION> when he
noticed the Keelbacks.
   ``I told the police, the federal wildlife service - I called a
lot of places'' to no avail, <PERSON>Robertson</PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION>Newsday</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``The guys in the store didn't believe me and got nasty about
it,'' said <PERSON>Robertson</PERSON>. ``I brought back a book, but they still
didn't believe me.''
   It was the city <ORGANIZATION>Health Department</ORGANIZATION> that took him seriously. Its
inspectors called a <ORGANIZATION>New York University</ORGANIZATION> biologist who confirmed
<PERSON>Robertson</PERSON>'s suspicions.
   A person who answered the phone <DATE>Friday</DATE> at the pet store
headquarters refused to comment.

HUNT YIELDS NO CLUE OF DEADLY SPIDER IN HOME;

<P>
CORONER SAYS FULLERTON WOMAN DIED OF BITE, MAKING HER COUNTY'S FIRST SUCH KNOWN 
FATALITY

<P>
No evidence of a poisonous spider was found <DATE>Thursday</DATE> in the search of a 
<ORGANIZATION>Fullerton</ORGANIZATION> home after the death of a woman who lived there was attributed to a 
spider bite. 
</P>
<P>
The <LOCATION>Orange County</LOCATION> coroner's office has ruled that the death early <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> of 
<PERSON>Patricia Garcia</PERSON>, 54, was caused by a spider. It was the first county death ever 
attributed to such a bite, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Confirmation 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Garcia</PERSON> reportedly suffered from weak kidneys, cirrhosis of the liver and 
cardiovascular disease, problems that could have intensified the effects of the 
bite. She was not treated for the bite until six days after it occurred. 
</P>
<P>
"I think she had these problems, and then the spider bite happened, and that 
compounded to kill her," said <PERSON>Bruce Lyle</PERSON>, a coroner's supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the official ruling, county officials and entomologists said no hard 
evidence had been gathered to confirm that a spider caused the death. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Dr. James Webb</PERSON>, an entomologist at <ORGANIZATION>Orange County Vector Control</ORGANIZATION>, said that 
unless the spider is found it would appear that there is only a "remote chance" 
that the cause of her death was spider bite. 
</P>
<P>
Officials searched the <PERSON>Garcia</PERSON> home for signs of the poisonous brown recluse 
spider, or any other species that could offer better clues to the woman's 
death, but found mostly non-poisonous cellar spiders, which are common to the 
area, county entomologist <PERSON>Rudy Geck</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Webb</PERSON> said <PERSON>Garcia</PERSON>'s symptoms were similar to those caused by the brown recluse, 
a member of the <PERSON>Loxoscetidae</PERSON> family, a poisonous group often called violin 
spiders because of markings on their upper backs. 
</P>
<P>
"The violin spider doesn't wander," <ORGANIZATION>Geck</ORGANIZATION> said. "It's almost something you have 
to search out in the dark places." He said vector control officials will resume 
searching boxes and corners in the garage next week. 
</P>
<P>
He suggested that <PERSON>Garcia</PERSON>'s husband of 35 years, <PERSON>Joseph</PERSON>, use pesticidal fog in 
the garage where the violin spider would most likely live, in nooks and 
crannies or darker areas. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia's daughters took her to <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther Hospital</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Anaheim</LOCATION> at <TIME>4 a.m.</TIME> 
<DATE>Saturday</DATE> after she awakened with a swollen eye and a blackened face, on the 
same side as the three bites resembling pimples over her eyebrow. She thought, 
and the coroner's report states, that she had been bitten by a spider about six 
days earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Typical immediate treatment of poison victims entails removing the infected 
area to stop the spread of the venom. However, because of the time lapse since 
<PERSON>Garcia</PERSON> thought she was bitten, the area was too badly infected to prevent 
further spreading, said <PERSON>Dr. Elizabeth Grimley</PERSON>, who was present at the hospital 
but did not treat the patient. 
</P>
<P>
There are few recorded cases of fatalities from spider bites, and most 
entomologists consider it surprising that <PERSON>Garcia</PERSON> actually died from a bite. 
</P>
<P>
"This is very surprising," said <PERSON>Dr. Charles Hogue</PERSON>, entomology curator at the 
<ORGANIZATION>Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History</ORGANIZATION>, estimating that nationwide less 
than <PERCENT>0.01%</PERCENT> of those who suffer spider bites die of them. The last reported area 
sighting of a brown recluse spider was in <ORGANIZATION>Sierra Madre</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1969</DATE>, he said. 
</P>
<P>
With proper medical treatment or antivenin, poisonous spider bites can be cured 
relatively easily, <PERSON>Hogue</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
A poisonous spider bite "puts the whole body under stress and calls on all the 
body's resources to fight it off," <PERSON>Hogue</PERSON> said. "If things aren't up to good 
working level, something has to give."

   PHOENIX, Ariz. -- Preparing to walk her miniature
schnauzer after work one recent day, Leslie Coty slipped into
some old shoes left out on her patio and felt a thorn-like
prick in her foot. As she kicked off her shoe, out crawled
what she says is "the ugliest thing I'd ever seen" -- a
half-inch-long black-widow spider.
   Within 30 seconds, a searing pain had shot up through her
body. "It was the kind of pain that makes it impossible to
scream," she says. "I thought I was having a heart attack."
Twelve hours later, the pain finally began to subside.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   <PERSON>Ms. Coty</PERSON>, a 34-year-old transplant from <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> who works
for <ORGANIZATION>Xerox Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, has grown wiser to the ways of the
Latrodectus hesperus, the sleek black spider with eight
elegant long legs and the characteristic red hourglass on its
underside. Now she keeps her footwear in firmly closed boxes
and always shakes her shoes before putting them on. When she
comes across a black widow, she douses it with hair spray.
"They suffocate," <PERSON>Ms. Coty</PERSON> says. "It's wonderful revenge" for
having been bitten, an experience doctors compare to
undergoing major surgery without an anesthetic.
   This most infamous of poisonous spiders thrives in warm
weather in every state except <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>. But it
really likes <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>, and, in particular, the suburbs of
<LOCATION>Phoenix</LOCATION>. Here, as in <LOCATION>Tucson</LOCATION>, golf courses and lawns produced
by irrigation have attracted insects on which the predatory
arachnids feast. The result: This swelling metropolitan area
of two million people -- and, conservatively, six million
spiders -- easily ranks as the nation's black-widow
spider-bite capital. One in five of the 2,350 cases reported
in <DATE>1989</DATE> occurred here, according to the <ORGANIZATION>American Association
of Poison Control Centers</ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION>Tucson</LOCATION>. Arizona as a
whole accounted for 1,000 bites.
   There is a saying here that what doesn't bite, sting or
stick can't be native <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>. Many locals are fairly
nonchalant toward the little lady who ensnares and feeds upon
her mate. But when birthing time comes to the spider
population during late <DATE>summer</DATE> -- just about now -- the human
populace goes on the prowl, either to eradicate the nests or
in search of spiders to sell for medical purposes.
   Some people hire one of the dozens of pest-control outfits
that deal with black-widow infestations here.
   Others go on seek and destroy missions. <PERSON>Raymond Webb</PERSON>, a
retired <ORGANIZATION>Motorola Inc.</ORGANIZATION> accountant, uses a broom to knock black
widows from the eaves under his roof, making sure to smash
the eggs because "that kills the crop for the future." <PERSON>Allen
Christo</PERSON>, a veterinarian in nearby <LOCATION>Mesa</LOCATION>, remembers how as a
boy he and his friends used blowtorches to dispatch black
widows in their nests. "It seemed fair. We had the torch, and
she had the poison," he explains.
   <PERSON>Viviane Walentiny</PERSON>, a mother of two with a gift for
understatement, says, "I worry because I know they aren't
good around the kids."
   Fortunately, human fatalities are extremely rare. Bite
victims here usually check into one of the two poison
treatment centers, which are now preparing for the seasonal
rush. Some are given morphine, to kill the pain. But likely
as not, a patient will receive antivenin, a serum produced
from the milk of the spider.
   <PERSON>Tom Taylor</PERSON> is one of the hardy local spider hunters who
helps stock the pharmaceutical shelves. He captures an
average of 70 black beauties a night during the nesting
season and sells them for <MONEY>$1</MONEY> each to <ORGANIZATION>Merck &amp; Co.</ORGANIZATION>, for use in
antivenin serum. His personal best: the 300 he captured at
<ORGANIZATION>Tempe High School</ORGANIZATION>, most from webs spun under the
football-stadium bleachers. (School was not in session.)
   On one recent night, armed only with flashlights and a
bagful of plastic-foam cups for holding his captives, <PERSON>Mr.
Taylor</PERSON> searches an industrial park. A flash of light on one
web shows a pregnant spider, its jet-black, red-splashed body
bloated with as many as 300 developing spiderlings. Taking
the lid off a cup, <PERSON>Mr. Taylor</PERSON> tries scooping up the expectant
mother. But the spider manages to scurry into a crack in a
wall.
   Further attempts on other webs, though, yield some healthy
specimens. The spiders must be kept in individual cups, he
explains, because of their notorious propensity for
cannibalism. Later, the spiders will be sealed in individual
plastic vials and shipped to <ORGANIZATION>Merck</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>West Point</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pa.</LOCATION>, in
boxes marked "Poisonous Live Black Widow Spiders."
   <PERSON>Chuck Kristensen</PERSON> has a more integrated operation at his
"spider farm" about 40 miles north of <LOCATION>Phoenix</LOCATION>, in <LOCATION>Black
Canyon City</LOCATION>. No sign marks the three-room establishment at
one end of the tiny dirt-road town. Inside are areas for
breeding black widows and milking their venom with a syringe,
a delicate procedure that he likens to "cutting diamonds."
The product is about as dear: venom customers in the academic
and commercial world, he says, pay <MONEY>$15,000</MONEY> per milliliter. To
produce even such a small amount takes tens of thousands of
milkings, or 300 milking-hours, among his stock of around
2,000 spiders, each of which can be milked about 10 times.
   Despite the abundance of spiders in <LOCATION>Phoenix</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Mr.
Kristensen</PERSON> goes elsewhere to replenish his stock. During his
nocturnal prowling, he says, "I've had too many policemen's
.38s pulled on me."
   His favorite hunting ground is near <LOCATION>Sedona</LOCATION>, the quaint
tourist and retirement haven farther north. It evokes
peculiar memories for the spider man -- such as how he once
found himself inexplicably singing "Jingle Bells" as he
sought his quarry near a local lake. Suddenly, he realized
why: "I looked around and everything was white with spider
webs."
   <PERSON>Mr. Kristensen</PERSON> has been bitten a number of times --
including once on the neck -- but each successive bite is
slightly less painful than the last. He figures he has built
a resistance over the years, though he adds, "I'm not going
to put that theory to the test." The closest he has come to
experiencing arachnophobia is the movie by that name, for
which he supplied 200 wolf, huntsman and tarantula spiders.
   Experiences with the black widow continue to creep across
the consciousness of some unfortunate citizens. "It scares me
to think how many black widows are on my property," says
<ORGANIZATION>University of Arizona</ORGANIZATION> extension agent <PERSON>Bryan Chadd</PERSON>. He patrols
his yard three times a week, hoping to spare his cat sure
agony and, perhaps, death. Though dogs tend to survive the
ordeal caused by the venom's attack on the central nervous
system, cats often become paralyzed and die. Spiders
themselves do not die after releasing venom. They live to
bite again.
   "I have a phobia about {black widows}," <PERSON>Mr. Chadd</PERSON>
continues. Recently, he was bitten in his sleep by a spider
he believes crawled onto a blanket as it dried in the
backyard.
   "That fear stays with you," he says of what he describes
as the worst physical experience of his life. "I couldn't
control my body. All I could do was cry."

<LEADPARA>  MY GREAT grandmother and grandfather threw all their belongings in the back of
a covered wagon and drove half way across this country to settle in Oregon. A
hundred and fifty years later we barely have room in the trunk of our car for
two small suitcases.;    The lack of trunk space began a few years ago when my
wife volunteered to be Building Warden at the place where she works. The
Building Warden, a charming sounding title that my kids have shortened for
home use, is "responsible for overseeing safety in the workplace." Basically,
this meant that my wife was responsible for fire evacuation and
squeeze-under-the-desk drills.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Even though my wife lost her volunteer position after she dived under her
desk during the <DATE>October 1989</DATE> earthquake and wouldn't come out, remnants of
warden training linger in our trunk.;    It's crammed with metallic-looking
blankets, bottled water, first aid supplies, tools, a shovel, a pick, rope, an
emergency flag, flares, extra shoes, crossing guard-type rain parkas, the list
goes on and on.;    Although we didn't plan to, we recently had an opportunity
to inventory the gear. On a weekend trip we stayed at a hotel where they have
guys dressed in band uniforms who take your luggage to your room while you
check in.;    Since none of us stayed with the car, a young man with "Andy"
embroidered on his uniform surgically emptied the trunk and took everything to
our room. The room resembled The Hyatt Touch at a <LOCATION>Mt. Everest</LOCATION> base camp.;   
Now I don't want to insinuate that each of us shouldn't be prepared for
possible disaster. What I want to point out is that there must be a limit
somewhere. My wife contends that she has already limited herself to the very
basics.;    "We could really use a small cook stove, a lantern and a snake-
bite kit," she told me. "We should also increase the dried food to feed four
of us for four days. We've got to look out for our family.";    Though, should
disaster strike I know what would happen. My wife is a very giving person. If
we were stranded with 70 other people, regular folks who carry golf clubs and
a spare tire in their trunk, I know that she would open our cache and share
the supplies. I'd be left with the package marked "Freeze-Dried Beef
Surprise." You know the old joke. The surprise is that there isn't any beef in
the meal.;    Late at night, when I'm lying in bed recounting the day's
activities and planning the next day, my mind sometimes wanders to the trunk
and I can't help thinking that what we really need is a small trailer for our
emergency stockpile.;    So keep an eye out for a man in a four-door sedan
pulling a small trailer. If it looks like me you'll know that I again have a
trunk, and also rest assured that should disaster strike I've got tools,
water, blankets, flares and. . . .  </TEXT>

   ``Coming to <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'' may be going to court.
   A <LOCATION>Memphis</LOCATION> man, <PERSON>Laurence Armour</PERSON>, has filed a <MONEY>$40 million</MONEY> lawsuit
against entertainer <PERSON>Eddie Murphy</PERSON>, claiming the comedian stole the
plot for the hit movie from <ORGANIZATION>Armour</ORGANIZATION>'s screenplay, ``The Cannibal.''
   Armour, 41, joins at least two others _ columnist Art <PERSON>Buchwald</PERSON>
and writer <PERSON>Shelby Gregory</PERSON> _ who claim the movie plot was taken from
their work.
   Armour said he sent the idea to comedian <PERSON>Richard Pryor</PERSON> in <DATE>1986</DATE>.
Pryor and <PERSON>Murphy</PERSON> are pals, and both work for <ORGANIZATION>Paramount Pictures</ORGANIZATION>, he
said.
   ``Coming to <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'' stars <PERSON>Murphy</PERSON> as an African prince who comes
to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> to seek a bride who will love him for what he
is, not for what he owns.
   <PERSON>Armour</PERSON> said his screenplay begins the same way, with an African
prince who comes to <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>. But in his script, the prince becomes a
cannibal after finding he likes the taste of flesh while sucking
venom from a snakebite.
   Armour's federal court lawsuit alleges that there are 20
substantial similarities between his script outline, a newspaper
clipping he sent along with it, and the movie.
   Buchwald told People magazine in <DATE>August</DATE> the movie was based on a
story he sold to Paramount titled ``It's a Crude, Crude World.''
   Buchwald hasn't filed a lawsuit, but <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> has sued for <MONEY>$10
million</MONEY>, claiming the movie was based on his script, ``Toto, the
African Prince.''
   <PERSON>S. Russell Headrick</PERSON>, a lawyer who has been retained to represent

snake wrapped around her neck and chewing on her arm. 
</P>
<P>
That same month, a middle-aged woman was treated for a similar problem. Her 
situation rivaled the shower scene in "Psycho": She was sitting on the toilet 
when a snake, entering the house from the septic system, lunged out of the 
water of the toilet bowl and struck her where she least expected it. 
</P>
<P>
Guam's only native snake is a harmless, blind reptile that resembles an 
earthworm. But unbeknown to the military during World War II, ships carrying 
wartime supplies to <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> from <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New Guinea</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Solomon Islands</LOCATION> 
also brought unwanted stowaways: brown tree snakes native to those areas that 
grow to 13 feet long. 
</P>
<P>
Without the natural enemies like the predatory birds found in its native lands, 
the snake's numbers on <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> have exploded to more than 6,000 per square mile, 
according to <PERSON>Thomas Fritts</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> fish and wildlife specialist in reptiles. 
And in the space of a few decades, the snakes have eaten almost all of <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION>'s 
birds. 
</P>
<P>
"By the time we discovered there was a problem, the snakes were totally out of 
control," said <PERSON>Fritts</PERSON>, who has been studying the snakes in an effort -- 
fruitless so far -- to control their numbers. 
</P>
<P>
Because the brown tree snake is not highly venomous, most people quickly 
recover from bites. But doctors see only part of the problem caused by the 
reptiles. The agile climbers slither up power lines and short-circuit wires, 
causing frequent blackouts that cost <MONEY>Guam millions of dollars</MONEY> a year. Young 
snakes pop out of automobile air-conditioning vents and scare drivers; some of 
the island's 121,000 residents have awakened to find the snakes in their beds. 
</P>
<P>
But worst of all, the nocturnal snakes eat almost anything and can slither 
almost anywhere, including along branches where birds and fruit bats roost, 
into holes where lizards hide and deep into hollow tree crevices where many 
bird species once laid eggs unmolested. 
</P>
<P>
The snakes' victims include two species that existed nowhere else on earth, the 
<LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> flycatcher and the <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> rail, both of which were once so abundant they 
were legally hunted. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole time I was on <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION>, I never heard a bird sound," said <ORGANIZATION>University of 
Connecticut</ORGANIZATION> ornithologist <PERSON>Robert Craig</PERSON>, who is studying the bird life of the 
<LOCATION>Marianas Islands</LOCATION>, which include <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION>. It was, he recalls, reminiscent of <PERSON>Rachel 
Carson</PERSON>'s book, "Silent Spring": "not a song, not a sound." 
</P>
<P>
Of <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION>'s 18 species of native birds, at least six have been wiped off the 
island since <DATE>1970</DATE>; <PERSON>Julie Savidge</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>University of Nebraska</ORGANIZATION> ecologist, has 
watched several of these species disappear during the course of her six-year 
study, while most others have become increasingly rare. "I was shocked at the 
decline," she said. "This is an example showing just how rapidly extinction can 
occur and the devastating effects exotic species can have." 
</P>
<P>
Because of their tree-climbing, night-traveling habits, the snakes went mostly 
unnoticed for the first few decades after they arrived. But today they are so 
numerous and so widespread that "eradication is way out of reach now," <PERSON>Fritts</PERSON> 
said. He estimates that in some areas, there may be as many as 12,000 tree 
snakes per square mile. "But control is possible," <PERSON>Fritts</PERSON> said. "First, we have 
to learn everything we can about the snake to find its weak point." 
</P>
<P>
When <PERSON>Savidge</PERSON> began her study in <DATE>1982</DATE>, no one really thought the snakes were a 
problem. No introduced reptile has been implicated in causing the extinction of 
a native animal. But that the snakes were at fault became quickly apparent as 
<PERSON>Savidge</PERSON> observed the secretive reptile's night feeding habits: She found that 
the snakes eat birds, bird eggs, lizards and small mammals -- even puppies, 
gripping them with powerful constricting muscles and then chewing on them until 
their flesh reaches the back of the snake's mouth, where its venomous fangs 
lie. 
</P>
<P>
Wildlife researchers are struggling for a solution. Savidge went as far as to 
pass out recipes for snake to people on the streets -- sweet and sour snake, 
snake adobo -- but they never caught on. Besides, <PERSON>Fritts</PERSON> said, the snakes are 
so numerous that even a bounty program probably won't help. 
</P>
<P>
Fritts hopes that further studies of the snake will yield an attracting 
chemical (to use in mass traps), repellent or fumigant. Eventually he hopes to 
establish some snake-free reserves for threatened species. 
</P>
<P>
A few of the rails and kingfishers were removed from the wild before they 
became extinct and are now being bred in zoos in hopes of reintroducing them to 
such reserves on <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> some day. But at the moment, efforts are focused on 
preventing the snakes' spread, like a malignant disease, from <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> to other 
islands. 
</P>
<P>
Ornithologist <PERSON>Craig</PERSON> is particularly worried about the birds on the other 14 
islands of the <LOCATION>Marianas</LOCATION> chain. Each island he's visited hosts bird species 
found nowhere else. If the tree snakes arrived on these islands, he said, "the 
loss to science would be devastating." 
</P>
<P>
It's not an unlikely scenario. Within the <DATE>last 10 years</DATE>, <PERSON>Fritts</PERSON> said, the 
snakes have shown up twice on <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>, and also on Kwajalein, an island 1,000 
miles east of <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION>, as well as <PERSON>Diego Garcia</PERSON>, an atoll in the <LOCATION>Indian Ocean</LOCATION>, and 
the islands of <LOCATION>Saipan</LOCATION> and Ponapi. All these snakes, which apparently found 
their way onto cargo ships, have either been killed or failed to establish a 
breeding population on these islands. 
</P>
<P>
Fritts and <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> colleagues have begun offering technical briefings at 
Micronesian and <LOCATION>Marianas</LOCATION> ports to teach inspectors how to look for the snakes 
in high-risk cargo like junk cars, lumber and government surplus property, 
where the snakes can easily hide. Such inspectors are already trained to look 
for agricultural pests and contraband, <PERSON>Fritts</PERSON> said, "but they aren't trained to 
look for snakes." No one envies them the job, "but somebody has got to do it."

extinction:

<HEAD>Snakes Win Round At Rattlesnake Rodeo</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OPP, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Operators of a rattlesnake rodeo, rattled by
criticism that they could be driving the <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> diamondback to
extinction, returned their catch to the wild <DATE>Sunday</DATE>.
   Because the 150 snakes were freed at the end of the two-day
event, no rattlesnake meat was on sale at Opp's 30th Rattlesnake
Rodeo for the thousands of people who attended. The meat had been
one of the better drawing cards over the years.
   In previous years, most of the 150 to 300 snakes that were
rounded up were either killed for their meat or sold to researchers
or snake exhibitors.
   ``We've been getting criticism for years from environmentalists,
animal rights groups and others about the way we did some things,''
said <PERSON>Jerry Hartzog</PERSON>, head snake handler for the Opp Jaycees. ``They
say we could be putting the <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> diamondback in danger of
extinction or something, so we've started working with them.''
   But the move brought criticism from residents who are upset at
the prospect of the snakes being turned loose in their southern
<LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION> community, <PERSON>Hartzog</PERSON> said.
   ``I reckon some people think we're going to just dump all of them
in one place,'' he added. ``That's not the case at all. We're going
to release the snakes back into the wild as close to where each was
caught as possible.''
   Others, like veteran snake hunter <ORGANIZATION>J.P. Jones</ORGANIZATION>, think the snakes
should be killed because they are a danger to hunters and others.
   ``If they (environmentalists) could see a little child die from a
rattlesnake bite like happened down here once, they'd change their
tune, I think,'' said <PERSON>Jones</PERSON>, the 68-year-old founder of the
rattlesnake roundup.
   The snakes originally were caught to make the woods safer for
hunters, he said.
   Before this year, the rodeo has raised more than <MONEY>$21,000</MONEY> for
charity.

   Maybe there was something amiss in the hiss.
   Maybe it was viperous vibes.
   Whatever the serpentine signal he received, <PERSON>Tom Robertson Jr.</PERSON>
deemed things were not as they ssssssssseemed.
   <PERSON>Robertson</PERSON>, 36, a self-taught snake expert and former zoo
employee, walked into a pet store on <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Upper West
Side</LOCATION> about a week ago to buy some fish food.
   When he glanced at a tank that supposedly held harmless garter
snakes, he recognized similar-looking, Asian water snakes known as
Redneck Keelbacks. The snake's bite, in rare instances, can be
fatal.
   ``I told a guy in the store,'' said <PERSON>Robertson</PERSON>. ``He said he knew
they weren't poisonous. I told him I could bring them some proof;
he got real arrogant. I brought back a book, but they still didn't
believe me. ... I called the police, the <ORGANIZATION>ASPCA</ORGANIZATION>, Fish and <PERSON>Wildlife</PERSON> -
I called a lot of places, trying to find out what to do.''
   Finally, someone at the city <ORGANIZATION>Health Department</ORGANIZATION> took him
seriously.
   The department's inspectors called a <ORGANIZATION>New York University</ORGANIZATION>
biologist who confirmed <PERSON>Robertson</PERSON>'s suspicions.
   The inspectors learned that a wholesaler had sold <ORGANIZATION>Petland
Discount</ORGANIZATION> stores about 50 supposedly harmless snakes - and that some
had been distributed to the chain's 50 stores in the metropolitan
area.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Health Department</ORGANIZATION> issued a public warning about the snakes
<DATE>Friday</DATE> and is investigating the matter.
   ``They believe me now,'' said <PERSON>Robertson</PERSON>, who received
congratulations <DATE>Friday</DATE> from neighbors and relatives.
   Since <DATE>Friday</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>American Society</ORGANIZATION> for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Animals has picked up at least five snakes from pet owners who
called for help. Two were venomous. Two were not. It was unclear
whether the fifth one was.
   In addition, 14 venomous snakes were removed from stores and
taken to the zoo.
   Redneck Keelbacks are not usually aggressive. But a bite can be
fatal if untreated, <ORGANIZATION>Health Department</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>Peter Lynn</PERSON> said.
   The orangy snakes are about 18 inches long and about as big
around ``as your pinky,'' Bronx Zoo spokeswoman <PERSON>Marilynn LeVine</PERSON>
said.
   <PERSON>Robertson</PERSON>, who's unemployed, has worked for pet store
wholesalers and for two years at a <LOCATION>Seattle</LOCATION> zoo. He owns about 50
snake books.
   He says he's not scared of snakes, even though ``any time you
handle them, you have it in the back of your mind'' that they might
bite.
   Respect, he said, is the key.
   He's snakeless, right now. But he's owned more than 200 - king
snakes, albino rat snakes, boa constrictors, pythons - since he was
8 years old.
   Still, he concedes that they're not the cleverest of pets:
   ``You can't train them, or teach them tricks.''

   Thousands of people taking shelter from
rising floodwaters in <LOCATION>Dhaka</LOCATION>'s streets and parks panicked <DATE>Friday</DATE>
when monsoon showers hit the city and triggered fears of a deluge.
   At least 120,000 people have fled homes in the countryside to
take shelter in <LOCATION>Dhaka</LOCATION>, a relief official said.
   ``There was great panic after the rain because for many there
was hardly any place to take cover,'' said the official, <PERSON>Abdur
Rashid</PERSON>.
   At least one-third of the country is flooded and newspapers say
758 people have died in house collapses, snake bites and drownings
since <DATE>June</DATE>, when the annual southwest monsoon hit the subcontinent.
The government says only 280 people have died, but its estimates
are considered low.
   More than half of <LOCATION>Dhaka</LOCATION> came under water after the adjacent
<LOCATION>Buriganga River</LOCATION> burst its banks. By <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>evening</TIME> the river, a
tributary of the mighty <LOCATION>Ganges</LOCATION>, was about three inches above flood
level, its highest in 34 years.
   The government has set up 125 relief camps in the city and
ordered the closure of all schools and colleges to use the
buildings to house displaced people, <PERSON>Rashid</PERSON> said.
   Floodwaters are 6 feet deep at places, and some residents were
reported to be hoarding food.
   <LOCATION>Dhaka</LOCATION>'s airport remained open for domestic flights, but
international airlines were advised to suspend operations for 24
hours. An airport official said up to 2 inches of water covered
parts of the complex.
   The Bengali-language Sangbad newspaper said <DATE>Friday</DATE> at least 10
more people died in the floods in the northern districts of
Mymnesingh and <LOCATION>Munshiganj</LOCATION>.
   The Ganges and the <LOCATION>Brahmaputra</LOCATION> rivers and their dozens of
tributaries flow from <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and through <LOCATION>Bangladesh</LOCATION> to the <LOCATION>Bay of
Bengal</LOCATION>. The rivers flood almost every year after the monsoon
showers in <LOCATION>Bangladesh</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>.
   Flooding began in the northern districts about three weeks ago,
but areas to the south were affected recently as the waters swirled
downstream.
   International aid for flood victims has arrived in response to
an appeal from President <PERSON>Hussain Muhammad Ershad</PERSON>. The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>
has pledged <MONEY>$25,000</MONEY> to help relief efforts and <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> sent four air
force helicopters to reach flood-affected areas.
   <LOCATION>Bangladesh</LOCATION> is one of the poorest countries in the world and its
109 million people earn a per capita income of about <MONEY>$150</MONEY> per year.
   At least 1,500 people died in floods last year. In <DATE>1985</DATE>, more
than 10,000 were killed when cyclones and tidal waves hit low-lying
islands in the <LOCATION>Bay of Bengal</LOCATION>, about 130 miles south of <LOCATION>Dhaka</LOCATION>.

   In 1974, David Phillips, a young American chemist on a
sabbatical in Switzerland, embarked on a research odyssey. It
has led him from studies of a rare inherited disease to snake
venom and, most recently, to one of the hottest areas in
biotechnology: the quest for a super aspirin.
   Today Dr. Phillips is the research director for Cor
Therapeutics Inc., a four-year-old, publicly held
biotechnology company in South San Francisco, Calif. Cor's
experimental super aspirin, called Integrelin, is in a
head-to-head race against drugs being developed by Merck &amp;
Co., the giant drug maker, Centocor Inc., a major biotech
outfit, and a pack of other pharmaceutical companies.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Some medical researchers believe that the super potent
aspirins, should they emerge from laboratories and clinical
studies, will save tens of thousands of lives by preventing
blood clots that can lead to heart attacks. Securities
analysts say the market for these medicines may reach <MONEY>$1
billion</MONEY> a year by decade's end, making them one of about a
dozen novel therapies to arise from basic scientific advances
at the heart of biotechnology.
   Indeed, nowhere is the marriage of new age molecular
biology, medicine and venture capital -- the hallmark of the
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> biotech industry -- more apparent than in the quest for
a super aspirin.
   Currently doctors prescribe aspirin and another drug,
heparin, to prevent the formation of blood clots in the
arteries of patients at risk for heart attack or stroke,
which such clots can cause.
   But "there is a tremendous need for medicines more potent
than aspirin and heparin," says <PERSON>Eric Topol</PERSON>, chief of
cardiology research at <ORGANIZATION>Cleveland Clinic Foundation</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>Dr. Topol</PERSON>
says superior clot blockers would provide life-saving
emergency room treatment for patients with unstable angina,
crushing chest pains that can signal an imminent heart
attack.
   Research cardiologists also believe that clot-blocking
drugs would increase the success of balloon angioplasty, a
fast-growing procedure in which doctors open coronary
arteries with balloon-tipped catheters. About <PERCENT>5%</PERCENT> to <PERCENT>10%</PERCENT> of
reopened arteries are squeezed shut again by the sudden
appearance of a clot.
   "Right now doctors can't be certain aspirin and heparin
will keep arteries open," <PERSON>Dr. Topol</PERSON> says. The first human
tests of Cor's Integrelin and another drug developed by
<ORGANIZATION>Centocor</ORGANIZATION> suggest that the new medicines are five times
stronger than aspirin in keeping blood cells from bunching
together into clots.
   The history of the super aspirin research in many ways
reflects the mix of serendipity, science and profit potential
that has fueled a spate of new biotech medicines for treating
cancer, infections, arthritis, allergies, AIDS and a host of
other poorly treated ailments.
   The super aspirin story began when <PERSON>Dr. Phillips</PERSON> spent two
years at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Bern</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Switzerland</LOCATION> studying a set
of families with a rare hereditary bleeding disorder, called
<ORGANIZATION>Glanzmann</ORGANIZATION>'s thrombasthina. The disease is characterized by a
malfunction of platelets, blood cells that stick together and
clot blood. The researchers discovered that family members
with the disease lacked crucial glue-like receptor proteins
that pop out on the platelets' outer surface and lock
together to clot blood at the site of an injury.
   "We already suspected that the proteins were an important
clue in unraveling the mystery of how platelets control
bleeding and form clots, " says <PERSON>Dr. Phillips</PERSON>. "But when we
saw them missing in this disease, we knew we were onto
something very important."
   Back in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, at the <ORGANIZATION>University of California</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>San
Francisco</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Dr. Phillips</PERSON> and his colleagues spent years
searching for the gene that makes the surface protein,
called, quite arcanely, GP2b,3a. By this time, scientists had
found that aspirin keeps platelets apart by literally jamming
the surface receptor. That finding, in the mid-1980s, spurred
research physicians to recommend that people with heart
disease take half a tablet of aspirin each day to reduce the
risk of heart attacks and strokes.
   But scientists soon realized that aspirin is "only a
modest blocker at best" of GP2b,3a, says <PERSON>Robert M. Califf</PERSON>,
director of cardiac care at <ORGANIZATION>Duke University Medical Center</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>Dr. Phillips</PERSON> and others figured that if they could isolate
the gene that makes the receptor protein, they could produce
enough of the protein to dissect its exact chemical
structure. That would make it possible to search for new
molecules that, more snugly than aspirin, would lock into the
receptor and keep platelets from binding to one another.
   In <DATE>1987</DATE>, his group "nailed the gene," <PERSON>Dr. Phillips</PERSON> says.
Soon afterward he and several colleagues were convinced
enough was known about the platelet receptor and several
other proteins involved in clot formation to form a company
to seek clot-blocking medicines.
   But publication of the gene finding tipped off researchers
at <ORGANIZATION>Merck</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Genentech Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>SmithKline Beecham PLC</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Hoffmann-La
Roche Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and other biotech company labs, and the race was
now on to find a drug to block the receptor.
   At <ORGANIZATION>Centocor</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Malvern</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pa.</LOCATION>, researchers used the
discovery to design an antibody that, given by injection,
would seek out the receptor and deactivate it. That product,
called CentoRx, is just now entering an advanced human test
of its ability to keep reopened arteries from shutting down
again.
   Cor's founders decided to search for a synthetic protein
that would be as potent as an antibody, but whose effect
would wear off more quickly. "Our worry was that a
long-lasting antibody would increase the danger of unwanted
bleeding," says <PERSON>Vaughn M. Kailian</PERSON>, <PERSON>Cor</PERSON>'s president and chief
executive officer.
   The scientists turned to snakes known as pit vipers for
their answer. These snakes kill by injecting their venom into
open wounds, causing their victims to bleed to death.
Scientists already had discovered that such venom works by
keeping blood from clotting. "But, what we wanted was a venom
that blocked only GP2b,3a, and not any of a number of
chemically similar receptors," <PERSON>Mr. Kailian</PERSON> says. Cor
researchers hoped that such a receptor blocker would be more
potent and safer than aspirin.
   Using the gene, Cor scientists produced large batches of
the protein against which they tested the snake venoms. In
<DATE>1990</DATE>, the scientists found what they were seeking in the
venom from a pygmy rattlesnake found in the southeast <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> By
<DATE>last year</DATE>, researchers at Cor led by <PERSON>Robert Scarborough</PERSON> had
constructed a small protein, Integrelin, that mimicked the
part of the snake's venom that snugly fit onto the platelet
receptor.
   In studies of healthy patients last year, researchers
found that Integrelin blocked <PERCENT>100%</PERCENT> of GP2b,3a receptors as
compared with about <PERCENT>20%</PERCENT> of receptors blocked by aspirin, says
<PERSON>Dr. Topol</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>University of Michigan</ORGANIZATION>. Based on that
result, <PERSON>Cor</PERSON> is expected to begin a small study of the drug in
preventing heart attacks for patients who arrive at hospital
emergency rooms with a form of angina that involves clots.
   Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION>Merck</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Rahway</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>, using a remarkably
similar research strategy, has also developed a synthetic
receptor blocker, called MK-852, that entered preliminary
human tests late last year. A slew of others, still back in
the labs, are expected to emerge in the next few years,
according to <PERSON>Mark Simon</PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION>Robertson, Stephens
&amp; Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>.
   The "competition . . . is intense," <PERSON>Mr. Simon</PERSON> says.

When a 4-foot rattlesnake slithered into <PERSON>Holly Lenz</PERSON>'s home <DATE>Sunday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME>, 
apparently headed for her 2-year-old son's bedroom, it was Lucy the adopted cat 
that sounded the alarm. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Lenz</PERSON> was outside in the sun, reading a book, when Lucy began hissing loudly. 
Lenz rushed inside and found the snake in a hallway, face to face with the cat, 
apparently trying to escape to the boy's bedroom. As <PERSON>Lucy</PERSON> kept the snake 
cornered, <PERSON>Lenz</PERSON> called police, who in turn alerted animal control authorities. 
</P>
<P>
When the ordeal was over the snake was dead, <PERSON>Lucy</PERSON> was being examined at an 
animal clinic and all the humans -- <PERSON>Adam</PERSON> the toddler, three police officers and 
an animal control worker -- were safe. 
</P>
<P>
"These three large, burly policemen stood well away and this little tiny woman 
from animal control went right in," <PERSON>Lenz</PERSON> said. "This little woman was fearless. 
She went right at it with one of those poles with a noose on it and got him by 
the head. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think they pay these people enough." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Lenz</PERSON>, 36, said the snake thrashed around when it was captured. Once it was 
taken outside, she said, a sheriff's deputy clubbed it with a shovel, chopping 
off its head. 
</P>
<P>
"Where are you going to relocate a 4-foot rattlesnake?" <PERSON>Lenz</PERSON> said. "I mean it's 
sad but what were they going to do with him? So they buried the head in my back 
yard because it is poisonous for 24 hours, and they took the body away." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Ronald Wheeler</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Orange County Animal Control</ORGANIZATION> office said snakes are 
commonly seen this time of year in the coastal desert areas such as <LOCATION>Laguna 
Niguel</LOCATION>, as well 
</P>
<P>
as in other areas of the county. 
</P>
<P>
The reptiles usually don't move into people's homes, <PERSON>Wheeler</PERSON> said, but they are 
more active during <DATE>spring</DATE> and <DATE>summer</DATE> when temperatures are warmer, often 
entering lawns and sunning themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Rattlesnakes usually strike only when they have been approached and challenged, 
<PERSON>Wheeler</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
"Typically, the people who get bit are those who are surprised by the snake." 
</P>
<P>
As for <PERSON>Lenz</PERSON>, she said she won't keep the sliding glass door to her bedroom open 
any more and will be more aware of the wildlife that abounds in <LOCATION>South County</LOCATION>. 
She said Lucy the cat, while fearless with the snake, needs a few lessons on 
dealing with people. 
</P>
<P>
"The minute the police showed up, my cat went under the bed," <PERSON>Lenz</PERSON> said. "She's 
not afraid of the rattlesnake but she's afraid of other people."

FT  09 SEP 94 / Snake venom may lead to new drugs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Venom from a deadly African snake, the green mamba, could lead to new drugs
to treat brain disorders, the <ORGANIZATION>British Association</ORGANIZATION> meeting was told.
Professor <PERSON>Alan Harvey</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Strathclyde University's Institute for Drug
Research</ORGANIZATION> described his work on dendrotoxin, an extremely potent nerve poison
extracted from mamba venom.
Dendrotoxin selectively blocks 'potassium channels' that are an essential
part of the signalling mechanism in nerve cells. The <LOCATION>Strathclyde</LOCATION> scientists
are developing small molecules based on dendrotoxin with the aim of boosting
the activity of certain chemical pathways that are damaged by progressive
brain diseases.
'Although dendrotoxin-like compounds would not be a cure for these diseases,
they may provide temporary relief from symptoms,' Prof <PERSON>Harvey</PERSON> said.
Conversely, compounds designed to have the opposite effect of activating
rather than blocking potassium channels 'may be a novel way of reducing
abnormal electrical activity in the brain,' he said. 'Hence they may form
the basis of a new type of anti-convulsant drug for epileptics.'
Prof <PERSON>Harvey</PERSON> said that in addition to the <LOCATION>Strathclyde</LOCATION> research he knew of two
drug companies working independently on dendrotoxins.
If the research leads successfully to a drug - which would take several
years - mamba venom would not be the first natural poison developed for the
benefit of human health.
Curare, the South American arrow poison, led to several muscle relaxant
drugs. Venom from the Brazilian arrowhead viper led to a range of drugs,
known as <ORGANIZATION>ACE</ORGANIZATION> inhibitors, which have been introduced over the <DATE>past 10 years</DATE>
to reduce blood pressure in heart patients.

   Some people's idea of Yuletide fun is to watch
the waiter bite the head off a live viper and pluck out the
still-squirming serpent's bladder. The slippery green organ is then
eaten raw.
   Sure, not everyone will cotton to that bitter flavor, but they
say snake enhances sexual prowess, so what's not to like?
   For one thing, snakes may be threatened with extinction, <LOCATION>Hong
Kong</LOCATION>'s government has declared.
   On <DATE>Friday</DATE>, the government adopted a law that requires snake
dealers to apply for import and export licences for king cobras,
Asiatic cobras and Oriental rat snakes. Failure to comply could
bring fines of up to <MONEY>$3,200</MONEY> and up to six months in jail.
   Chan Ping-kwong, spokesman for the Agriculture and <ORGANIZATION>Fisheries
Department</ORGANIZATION>, said the government would collect data on snake imports
to make sure the reptiles aren't in danger of extinction.
   More than 100,000 snakes are imported by <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> each year,
mostly from <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Chan</PERSON> said.
   Serpent eating is a feature of social life in the British
colony, especially during <DATE>winter</DATE> when the vipers are reportedly
tastiest, having gorged themselves to prepare for hibernation.
   Snake soup is a staple of business banquets this time of year,
and trade unions are organizing year-end snake feasts to kick off
an election campaign for the legislature and other local offices
next year.
   The most common snake dish is a soup, cooked with mushrooms,
bamboo shoots and dried orange peels. The potion is reputed to
speed the metabolism and improve male sexual performance.
   Another favorite, snakes' skin soaked in malt wine, is believed
to have calming effects similar to that of tranquilizers.
   Perhaps the most spectacular way of eating snake is swallowing
raw bladders. The dark green organ is extremely slippery and has an
intensely bitter taste.
   To show how fresh their product is, <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> vendors bite the
snake's head off in front of customers, who get to watch the body
of the reptile wriggle through the vendor's fingers as he searches
for the organ.
   The conservation organization World Wide Fund For Nature said it
supported the government's licensing decision.
   ``If unrestricted trade continues, snakes will one day become
endangered,'' said <PERSON>Amy Lau</PERSON>, the fund's conservation officer in <LOCATION>Hong
Kong</LOCATION>.
   Snake trader <PERSON>Tam Sun</PERSON>, who runs a small shop in downtown <LOCATION>Hong
Kong</LOCATION> that sells snake soup, said he has no choice but to pass on
the cost of the new import license to his customers, who now pay <MONEY>$2</MONEY>
for a bowl.
   ``Our profit margin is already pretty narrow,'' <PERSON>Tam</PERSON> said, after
biting off the head of a green snake. ``Prices of snake soup will
go up <PERCENT>30 percent</PERCENT>.''

   He wears <PERSON>John Lennon</PERSON> spectacles and looks frail in rare photographs. 
He suffers from malaria and says he has survived three snakebites. 
The few outsiders who have met him say he talks like a naive idealist out of the <DATE>1960s</DATE>. 

   Armed with a spear and a flute, however, <PERSON>Bruno Manser</PERSON>, a 32-year-old Swiss artist, has also roamed <LOCATION>Sarawak</LOCATION>'s remotest jungles for 2 1/2 years as a fugitive. 
He has been befriended and protected by the region's last known tribe of nomadic hunters and gatherers, the Penans. 
He has compiled a dictionary of their language and folk tales. 
And he has enlisted in their fight to save their tropical rain-forest homeland from logging-company chainsaws and bulldozers. 

   Officials in <LOCATION>Sarawak</LOCATION>, a state that is dominated by timber politics and money, have denounced <PERSON>Mr. Manser</PERSON> as a "Communist" and a "Zionist." 
<LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION>'s largest newspaper, the <ORGANIZATION>New Straits Times</ORGANIZATION>, ridiculed him in an elaborate <DATE>April</DATE> Fools' Day spoof. 
Local environmentalists refrain from publicly supporting him for fear of being branded accomplices of an "outside agitator" and "outlaw" -- his visa expired <DATE>Dec. 31, 1984</DATE>. 

   Despite his notoriety, <PERSON>Mr. Manser</PERSON> is only a bit player. 
But the battle he has joined for native rights and forest preservation is taking center stage in <LOCATION>Sarawak</LOCATION>. 

   The fight has escalated in recent months as the Penans (pronounced peenahns), armed with blowguns and poison darts, spears and a few shotguns, have blockaded logging trails and tried to stop loggers from sawing down the huge tropical hardwoods -- some 150 feet tall -- that dot their high-country hunting grounds. 

   In <DATE>April</DATE>, more than 100 Penans besieged a lumber camp near <LOCATION>Long Layun</LOCATION> in the upper <LOCATION>Baram River</LOCATION> watershed. 
Since then, Penans have blockaded 12 lumber roads, preventing trucks from carrying out logs. 
And members of other tribes in the region have joined their fight. 

   State officials and the local press have tried to play down the confrontations. 
But some federal officials in <LOCATION>Kuala Lumpur</LOCATION>, the Malaysian capital, are sympathetic, possibly because of embarrassment over a scandal involving timber riches accumulated by politicians who rule <LOCATION>Sarawak</LOCATION>, the country's biggest but least developed state. 

   The scandal broke because of a bitter feud between the state's chief minister, <PERSON>Taib Mahmud</PERSON>, and his uncle, <PERSON>Abdul Rahman Yakub</PERSON>, a former chief minister and governor. 
The two men, who identify with the ethnic Malay minority here, have successively ruled <LOCATION>Sarawak</LOCATION> for 17 years. 

   The names of the people who get timber concessions have long been shrouded in secrecy. 
But to score points against each other in a state election campaign last <DATE>spring</DATE>, each man disclosed lists of who got concessions when the other was in power. 
As many suspected, the lists included mostly political cronies, wives, daughters and other relatives in a Marcosian web of front companies and foreign bank accounts. 
Lumber merchants estimate that at current prices, 25 concessions awarded to <PERSON>Mr. Rahman</PERSON>'s friends and relatives are worth more than <MONEY>$4.2 billion</MONEY> in logs. 

   The concessions are free, granted as political patronage. 
Concessionaires quietly sell or subcontract their tracts to logging companies, mostly owned by ethnic Chinese, for under-the-table millions. 
The state is then paid a royalty based on the amount of wood extracted. 
The natives who live in the forests get next to nothing. 

   <LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION> has been the world's biggest exporter of tropical hardwood logs. 
Half go to <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, and the rest go to <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and a few other countries. 
At logging rates estimated at more than 180 acres an hour, mostly in <LOCATION>Sarawak</LOCATION> and Sabah on the island of <LOCATION>Borneo</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION>'s hardwoods will be gone by <DATE>1996</DATE>, according to <PERSON>Ismail Salleh</PERSON>, a university economist. 

   The destruction of tropical rain forests -- and the resulting loss of plant and animal species -- has become a cause celebre among international environmental groups. 
But <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>'s jungles and <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>'s animals get much more attention than the rain forests of <LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Indonesia</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION>. 

   Local environmental groups are fledgling, with little influence. 
And local governments like to keep them that way. 

   With 48,612 square miles, <LOCATION>Sarawak</LOCATION> is a little smaller than <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> state. 
Some <PERCENT>80%</PERCENT> of its 1.5 million people live in rural areas. 
Borneo's natives make up nearly <PERCENT>40%</PERCENT> of the state's population. 
They are called Dayaks, a collective name for two dozen indigenous tribal groups, including the Ibans, Bidayuhs, <PERSON>Kenyahs</PERSON>, Kayans and Penans. 
Most live in communal longhouses along rivers and were converted to Christianity by missionaries years ago. 

   Those living in up-river high country depend on forests and streams for game, fish and wild fruit, and they practice swidden, or slash-and-burn, agriculture on hillsides. 
The government says swidden farming is destroying the forests. 
It has been trying to lure its practitioners down river into modern development projects such as oil palm and rubber plantations. 

   But <PERSON>Evelyne Hong</PERSON>, a social researcher in <LOCATION>Penang</LOCATION>, defends swidden farming as an ecologically sound form of crop rotation, given poor forest soil. 
She says that it destroys only 1/50th of the forests that logging destroys each year. 
After clearing two or three acres, families practicing swidden plant rice and vegetable crops for one or two years and then move on, allowing the soil to regain nutrients for 10 or 15 years before returning to grow another food crop. 

   "Ironically, this attack on swidden is led by planners, policy makers and bureaucrats who are the very people responsible for the wholesale logging of tropical forests, causing massive erosion, depletion of precious topsoil, ecological disruption and climatic imbalances in the environment," she writes in a new book, "Natives of <LOCATION>Sarawak</LOCATION>: Survival in <LOCATION>Borneo</LOCATION>'s Vanishing Forests." 

   Logging damage has incensed many Dayaks in recent years, especially since the logging companies have moved into precipitous mountain areas. 
The recent money revelations have fueled cries of "Dayak nationalism" among native leaders who have traditionally fought among themselves. 
In <DATE>April</DATE>, Dayaks doubled their number of seats in the state legislature to 15, making them the biggest single party in the 48-member body. 

   Logging Site 21 of <ORGANIZATION>Rimbunan Hijau Timber Co.</ORGANIZATION> is situated about 40 miles into mountainous jungle from the <LOCATION>Rajang River</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>central Sarawak</LOCATION>. 
It consists of three shacks occupied by Iban families, whose men cut trees with chainsaws. 
Logging provides jobs for <PERCENT>9%</PERCENT> of the state's labor force. 

   The steep surrounding hillsides sport reddish-brown cuts in all directions. 
They are made by huge bulldozers that move off the main logging road to retrieve logs, cutting their own horizontal switchback trails into the hillsides. 

   Nearby residents say that the sputtering chainsaws and roaring bulldozers scare away the wild pigs, monkeys, birds and other animals they eat. 
Friendly orangutans are long gone. 
Thousands of the gentle, red-haired apes used to inhabit <LOCATION>Sarawak</LOCATION>'s forests. 
The state's current estimate is 250. 

   What the bulldozers expose is old, crumbling sedimentary strata -- sandy soil, shale and clay layers. 
When exposed to tropical downpours, which are frequent, these layers literally dissolve. 
Erosion is swift. 
Deep gullies appear in the trails. 
Even main arteries, on which 40-ton trucks carry 40 tons of logs each to river tugs and barges, wash out regularly. 

   The eroded sediment ends up in streams, then rivers, turning water that was once the color of weak tea into a thick liquid the color of coffee with too much cream. 
The people who live here say that their fish, a prime source of protein, die and that drinking the water sometimes makes them sick. 

   Despite complaints, the technique of using bulldozers to get logs off forested mountainsides doesn't bother state officials. 
In fact, the man who pioneered the technique, <PERSON>James Wong</PERSON>, is a state official -- the minister for the environment and tourism. 

   Jalong <LOCATION>Sepang</LOCATION> is a 23-year-old Kenyah, the seventh of nine children born at <ORGANIZATION>Long Anap</ORGANIZATION>, a longhouse in hill country that has yet to be logged. 
After studying for three years at a technical institute in <LOCATION>Kuala Lumpur</LOCATION>, he returned to Marudi to look for work. 

   Long <ORGANIZATION>Anap</ORGANIZATION> has 30 "doors" -- one-room apartments built on stilts in a long, connected row -- and about 250 residents. 
Last <DATE>December</DATE>, officials from <ORGANIZATION>Samling Timber Co.</ORGANIZATION> visited to announce that they held the logging concession for the area and were about to begin work. 
They invited the chief of <ORGANIZATION>Long Anap</ORGANIZATION> and chiefs of 11 nearby longhouses -- all state appointees -- to a meeting. 
Most of the chiefs can't read, but after a friendly talk, 10 of them signed or put their thumbprints on an agreement saying that they wouldn't interfere with the loggers. 
The agreement also bound the chiefs not to complain or seek compensation for water pollution, erosion, damage to the jungle or the disappearance of wildlife. 

   In return, the timber company promised to pay small sums for any damaged fruit, coffee and cocoa trees, provided they once bore fruit. 
The company also offered each longhouse <MONEY>$800</MONEY> annually for Christmas celebration money. 

   "Two trees are worth that much," says <PERSON>Mr. Sepang</PERSON>, who joined the <PERSON>Sahabat Alam Malaysia</PERSON> (Friends of the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>) office in <LOCATION>Marudi</LOCATION>, which has a staff of four to monitor both <LOCATION>Sarawak</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Sabah</LOCATION>. 

   Five of the chiefs say that they have pulled out of the agreement. 
An "action committee" has been formed to keep the loggers out. 
Company lawyers say that they weren't legally bound to offer the longhouses anything since they have a valid concession from the state. 

   In <DATE>1973</DATE>, nine Iban families -- including <PERSON>Sadam Nayawai</PERSON>, then 19 years old, his parents and his new bride -- agreed to leave their longhouse near <LOCATION>Binatang</LOCATION> to participate in one of the state's first big resettlement projects. 
They joined some 3,000 others in creating a 60,000-acre oil palm plantation out of swampy, low-land jungle east of <LOCATION>Bintulu</LOCATION> along <LOCATION>Sarawak</LOCATION>'s north sea coast. 

   In return for clearing the land, planting the palms and nurturing them into production, each family was promised 15 acres of productive palms, 10 acres of other crop land, housing, electricity, a clean water supply and other amenities. 
The first phase took six years, during which able-bodied hands were paid <MONEY>$3</MONEY> a day. 

   When the palms began bearing oil nuts in <DATE>1979</DATE>, the families were paid <MONEY>$16</MONEY> a ton to harvest them and <MONEY>$5</MONEY> as a year-end bonus. 
After the first year, the bonus stopped. 

   Poor soil fertility and low world palm-oil prices turned the project into a money loser. 
When it came time, in <DATE>1983</DATE>, to give deeds to the palm and crop land, the families were told to wait. 
Last <DATE>summer</DATE>, plantation managers cut harvesting pay to <MONEY>$6</MONEY> a ton. 
<PERSON>Mr. Nayawai</PERSON> says that he and his wife can't harvest enough to support his three children and aging parents. 
"It's bitter work," he says. 

   In <DATE>September</DATE>, the plantation workers went on strike. 
There were riots, and oil palms were set on fire. 
Some 2,000 workers were fired. 
Poor Indonesian Moslems from <LOCATION>Sulawesi</LOCATION>, called "Bugis," were happy to take their jobs. 
About 1,000 Ibans and other workers drifted back to their longhouses or took up residence in squatter slums in <LOCATION>Bintulu</LOCATION> and Miri. 
But an additional 624 of them, including <PERSON>Mr. Nayawai</PERSON>, refuse to leave the plantation and have sued to get their promised land. 

   Word of the resettlers' plight has spread far up the <LOCATION>Baram River</LOCATION>, to the longhouse of <LOCATION>Jalong Sepang</LOCATION> and into the forests where the Penans roam. 
Many up-river residents have come down to the coastal towns, gotten laboring jobs, tasted the luxuries of the cash economy and stayed. 
But many return to their longhouses and forests. 

   The nomadic Penans travel with the ripening cycle of wild jungle fruit. 
They eat the fruit, and it attracts animals like wild pigs, which the Penans kill with silent blowguns and poisonous darts. 

   In the early <DATE>1970s</DATE>, a French writer named <PERSON>Mady Villard</PERSON> spent time with a four-family Penan group in their forest. 
She described it this way: 

   "The trees are gigantic, their trunks often covered with parasitic flowers, their branches arching far overhead, stopping the rays of the sun. . . . 
Full of secrets and moving colors, the atmosphere here is almost as in our cathedrals. . . . 


   "But above all, here is the kingdom of the Penans, who circulate within it like swift and elusive ghosts, always ready to vanish at the smallest alarm."
