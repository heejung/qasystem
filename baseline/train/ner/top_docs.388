   <PERSON>Christopher Columbus</PERSON> could have told them
it wouldn't be easy.
   Ninety Spaniards sailing in exact replicas of <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>' three
ships, the <ORGANIZATION>Nina</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Pinta</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Santa Maria</LOCATION>, departed from this
southwestern <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> port <DATE>Friday</DATE> on a six-month <LOCATION>Mediterranean</LOCATION> sea
trial.
   But by <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, the explorers, who are preparing for a planned
<DATE>1992</DATE> re-creation of <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>' voyage to the New World, found
themselves back in port after they were blown to land by a
windstorm.
   Undaunted, <ORGANIZATION>Spanish navy</ORGANIZATION> Capt. <PERSON>Santiago Bolivar</PERSON>, the leader of
the mission, told reporters <DATE>Saturday</DATE>: ``We're going to wait out the
winds before starting out again for our first destination.'' That
destination is <LOCATION>Almeria</LOCATION>, a southwestern Spanish port roughly 310
miles east of <LOCATION>Huelva</LOCATION>.
   The ships' joyful sendoff <DATE>Friday</DATE> coincided with the 498th
anniversary of the day <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> began his first voyage to what
would become known as <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>.
   <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>, which bankrolled <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>, spent <MONEY>$2 million</MONEY> to build the
three ships from Galician pine and oak from the <LOCATION>Pyrenees</LOCATION>.
   The ships were built to help promote the Expo '92 World's Fair
in the southern city of <LOCATION>Seville</LOCATION> and to commemorate the 500th
anniversary of <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>' legendary voyage.
   Expo '92 is expected to attract 20 million visitors to <LOCATION>Seville</LOCATION>
from <DATE>April</DATE> to <DATE>October 1992</DATE>.
   While the sailors will attempt to follow the exact sailing
methods of <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> and his intrepid men, the ships are equipped
with sophisticated equipment to navigate via satellite and carry
modern-day lighting.

   Replicas of the ships that accompanied
<PERSON>Christopher Columbus</PERSON> on his <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> crossing have set sail, but
this time in search of tourist dollars instead of precious metals
and spices.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Nina</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Pinta</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Santa Maria</LOCATION> on <DATE>Friday</DATE> began their six-month
voyage to a dozen Spanish ports to prepare for a <DATE>1992</DATE> re-enactment
of <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>' trip to the <LOCATION>New World</LOCATION>.
   The ships have a total of 90 crew members and all but the
commander, a Spanish navy captain, will sleep outdoors, as
<LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>' crew did on the voyage to <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>.
   Like <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Capt. Santiago Bolivar</ORGANIZATION> will lead from the deck of
the <LOCATION>Santa Maria</LOCATION>, the flagship.
   ``The objective of the <DATE>1992</DATE> voyage will be to study in action
the navigation methods of the <DATE>15th century</DATE> and the effectiveness of
<LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>' sailing methods,'' <PERSON>Bolivar</PERSON>, 40, told reporters.
   The 15th century Spanish royalty bankrolled <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>.
   Today's government spent <MONEY>$2 million</MONEY> to build the three replica
ships from Galician pine and oak from the <LOCATION>Pyrenees</LOCATION>. They sailed
from this southern port _ 310 miles southwest of <LOCATION>Madrid</LOCATION> _ 498 years
to the day of <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>' first voyage to the New World.
   The head of the government company planning the <DATE>1992</DATE>
celebrations, <PERSON>Luis Yanez</PERSON>, saw them off and laid a wreath at a
monument to <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Yanez</PERSON> said the ships were built to help promote the Expo '92
World's Fair in the southern city of <LOCATION>Seville</LOCATION>. Expo '92 is expected
to attract 20 million visitors to <LOCATION>Seville</LOCATION> from <DATE>April</DATE> to <DATE>October
1992</DATE>.
   ``An Expo such as this one is a unique occasion to launch a
country's image around the world,'' the exposition's commissioner,
<PERSON>Manuel Olivencia</PERSON>, has said.
   At least 105 countries and 20 international organizations have
signed commitments to build pavilions in <LOCATION>Seville</LOCATION> to display their
newest technologies and designs.
   The ships aren't the only promotion for Expo <DATE>'92</DATE>. A promotional
quiz game that cost <MONEY>$707,000</MONEY> to develop is to begin running soon in
Spanish newspapers to familiarize Spaniards with the discoveries of
the past 500 years.
   The government is also pumping an estimated <MONEY>$1 billion</MONEY> into Expo
'92 to modernize <LOCATION>Seville</LOCATION>'s public works communications systems and
<MONEY>$6 billion</MONEY> into the rest of the southern region of <LOCATION>Andalusia</LOCATION>.
   The ships are a particular point of pride. Last year, <LOCATION>Queen
Sofia</LOCATION> christened the single-decked 117-foot-long <LOCATION>Santa Maria</LOCATION>. Her
daughter, <PERSON>Princess Elena</PERSON>, christened the <LOCATION>Nina</LOCATION> and Princess Cristina
the <LOCATION>Pinta</LOCATION>.
   The two smaller caravelles are 50 feet long.
   While the sailors will attempt to follow the exact sailing
methods of <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>, the ships are equipped with sophisticated
equipment to navigate via satellite and carry modern-day lighting.
   For protection, a <ORGANIZATION>navy</ORGANIZATION> frigate will escort them.

<MEMO>  The Great Columbus Chase
Second in a four-part series  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Up on a wall next to the <ORGANIZATION>Church of St. George</ORGANIZATION> in this small, sunny town in
southwestern <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> is this bold proclamation, set in blue tile:;    "Oh,
Palos! Your glory cannot be equaled. Not even <LOCATION>Memphis</LOCATION>. Not even <LOCATION>Thebes</LOCATION>. Not
even immortal <LOCATION>Rome</LOCATION>. Not even <LOCATION>Athens</LOCATION>. Not even <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>. No city can dispute your
historical fame!";    After all that puffy back-patting, it was natural the
citizenry would throw up a statue or two to commemorate their self-designated
place in history, and indeed, they did.;    So, there is a statue here of the
man who discovered <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>, but it ain't that Italian upstart, Cristobol
Colon. Nope, it's a statue of  <PERSON>Martin Alonso Pinzon</PERSON>, captain of the Pinta
(yeah, that Pinta) and a hometown boy who, they tell you in these parts, made
good but never got the credit.;    And on a brilliant whitewashed house next
to the old church is a colorful portrait, also in tile, of <PERSON>Vicente Yanez
Pinzon</PERSON>, <PERSON>Martin Alonso</PERSON>'s kid brother and the captain of the <PERSON>Nina</PERSON> (yeah, that
Nina). The folks in Palos say that <PERSON>Vicente</PERSON>, who was made captain-general and
corregidor (head of state) of <LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION>, also discovered <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> and the
mouth of the <LOCATION>Amazon River.</LOCATION>;    Palos and the <ORGANIZATION>Church of St. George</ORGANIZATION> were central
in the saga of the <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> voyage.;    <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>, after years of hanging
around the court of Isabella and Ferdinand, finally got the two sovereigns to
back his trip. But, never a couple to spend a peseta unnecessarily, the royal
pair decided on a little end-around run.;    The sailors of Palos -- including
the Pinzons -- had long experience at sea, trading in <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Azores</LOCATION>.
Right after they promised <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> three ships, the king and queen dug up an
old case involving some African goods imported to Palos without royal duty
being paid.;    The fine for this forgotten infraction was -- guess what --
two ships, ready to sail and loaded with enough stuff to last a year. (Why pay
for three ships, they figured, when we can stiff the good people of Palos for
two of them? Were these two good, or what?);    The taxpayers of Palos were
thus forced to pay for their part in history. The two ships in question were,
of course, the <ORGANIZATION>Nina</ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION>Pinta</LOCATION>. You can guess how popular <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> was when
he arrived in town with that news. The royal order was issued in <DATE>May</DATE> -- and
somehow, the ships were provisioned and ready for sea by August.;    <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>
and the elder <PERSON>Pinzon</PERSON> had known each other off and on for years. Near Palos is
the monastery of La Rabida, where <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> spent several years plotting how to
get Ferdinand and Isabella to give him an ear, and some historians say <PERSON>Martin
Alonso</PERSON> was in on the planning.;    And it seems unlikely that without <PERSON>Pinzon</PERSON>
going to bat for him, <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> would ever have convinced the neighborhood
sailors to wander off toward the edge of the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> -- especially with a
foreigner.;    And it's pretty obvious, looking back, that <PERSON>Palos</PERSON> and other
nearby villages were part of the scheme from the start. The Pinzons and dozens
of other experienced sailors were on tap, the <LOCATION>Pinta</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Nina</LOCATION> were already
there and the town was well placed on a little backwater on the <ORGANIZATION>Rio Tinto</ORGANIZATION>, a
wide river that opens into the sea a few miles from town.;    Relationship
turns icy;    On the night of <DATE>Aug. 2, 1492</DATE>, <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>, the Pinzons and the rest
of the crews went to the <ORGANIZATION>Church of St. George</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Palos</LOCATION> for Mass, then filed
down a set of stairs next to the church to where the three ships were
anchored, and boarded. They sailed the next morning.;    There's little left
today of the anchorage. The small arm of water that connected Palos to the <LOCATION>Rio
Tinto</LOCATION> is long-since silted up, and the only evidence that a wharf ever existed
is a memorial marker and a bit of stone wall.;    It was after the three ships
arrived in the <LOCATION>New World</LOCATION> that things apparently got fairly icy between
<LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Martin Alonso</PERSON>. One historian says <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> was constantly afraid
that <PERSON>Pinzon</PERSON> would discover gold before he did (the <LOCATION>Pinta</LOCATION> sailed a good deal
faster than the tubby <LOCATION>Santa Maria</LOCATION>). And toward the middle of their exploration
of <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>Pinta</LOCATION> -- and <PERSON>Pinzon</PERSON> -- disappeared for two months. Desertion?
Miscalculation? Gold fever? Who knows?;    Reneging on a deal;    The <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>
fleet, minus the <LOCATION>Santa Maria</LOCATION>, which hit a reef on <ORGANIZATION>Christmas Day</ORGANIZATION>, returned to
Palos in triumph in <DATE>March 1493</DATE>. There were, by all reports, huge parties.
<PERSON>Martin Alonso Pinzon</PERSON> did not attend. Five days after he returned to <LOCATION>Palos</LOCATION>, he
died.;    In later years, <PERSON>Isabella</PERSON> and Ferdinand tried to renege on pre-voyage
payment deals they had made with <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>. One of the strategies they used was
trying to prove that the whole idea -- sailing west to the Indies -- was the
brainchild of <PERSON>Martin Alonso Pinzon</PERSON> and his family. This started suits and
counter-suits that went on for centuries.;    It also created the stubborn
pride of the people of Palos, who for five centuries have said the wrong man
got the credit. Italian author <PERSON>Gianni Granzotto</PERSON>, in his rather biased <DATE>1984</DATE>
biography of <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>, suggests that the statue of <PERSON>Martin Alonso</PERSON> is
chauvinistic and "clouds the issue.";    "Fame does not make mistakes," he
writes. "Five centuries after the fact, the name of <PERSON>Christopher Columbus</PERSON> still
resounds throughout the world. . . . How many people have heard of Pinzon?
Time has buried him, swallowed him up. . . . There (is) a great distance
between him and <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>, the distance between obscurity and glory.";    So in
the end <PERSON>Martin Alonso</PERSON> lost. Not only did he die before the full impact of the
voyage was realized, but he also disappeared into history, just a footnote to
the <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> myth. Except, of course, in Palos de la Frontera, whose "glory
cannot be equaled.";    The best thing now that can be said for Palos is that
it's close to the Portuguese border and the attractions of the Algarve. If
you're passing by this way, say howdy to <PERSON>Martin Alonso</PERSON> and his kid brother,
look at the church, then drive like a bat for the border.;    <DATE>Today</DATE>, <PERSON>Palos</PERSON>
sits in a bowl of pollution from refineries and factories on both sides of the
<ORGANIZATION>Rio Tinto</ORGANIZATION>. There is another refinery on the coast near La Rabida, and <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>
would have trouble steering his small ships out to sea because of the haze.
The monastery (which now has a bar and restaurant on the grounds) is, like
almost every other <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> site in <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>, closed for repairs, but will be
open again in time for the grand celebration next year.;    And if you're
smart, and happen to be in Palos along about <DATE>August of 1992</DATE>, you'll forget all
about <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> and the ocean blue and <DATE>1492</DATE> and all that pastafazool -- and
remember who really discovered the <LOCATION>New World.</LOCATION>; NEXT WEEK: <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> returned in
glory to <LOCATION>Barcelona</LOCATION> after his epic first voyage. He wouldn't recognize the
place now -- and probably couldn't even get out of town. Good luck, <DATE>1992</DATE>

The Great Columbus Chase  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     That much, we know, is true. Somebody named <PERSON>Christopher Columbus</PERSON>, or
<PERSON>Cristoforo Colombo</PERSON> (the Italian version) or Cristobal Colon (the Spanish
spelling), did sail from a tiny port in southern <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> on <DATE>Aug. 3, 1492</DATE>, cross
the <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION>, land somewhere in the <LOCATION>Bahamas</LOCATION>, then return to spread the word
that a new world awaited those who embraced God, glory and gold.;    His
diaries exist. The logs of his journeys to the Americas exist. We know where
he died and have some idea where he might be buried. We also have some
indication that he was no saint or selfless explorer, as generations of
American school kids have been taught. Indeed, there is evidence to suggest he
was greedy, malicious, conniving and a cheat. (See accompanying article by
<PERSON>Nora Villagran</PERSON>.);    Whatever, <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> is getting very excited about <DATE>1992</DATE> and
the quincentennial of the <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> voyage. <LOCATION>Barcelona</LOCATION> is holding the <DATE>summer</DATE>
Olympic Games and <LOCATION>Seville</LOCATION> is holding the <DATE>1992</DATE> Expo. Both events will be
heavily laced with <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> celebrations. <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> is also gearing up for a fete
or two to honor its native son, especially in his home town of Genoa.;    But
the celebrations are not confined to <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>. From <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>;
from <LOCATION>Toronto</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>, there are events planned all next year to honor the man
who officially (if not factually) discovered <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>, though he's several
parts enigma.;    His legacy is uncertain, his contributions unclear. But he
has left footprints all over Europe.;    Following those footprints adds
little to the truth about the man -- but the footprints do take you to some
interesting spots.;    Over the next several weeks, from <LOCATION>Genoa</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Barcelona</LOCATION>,
from <LOCATION>Granada</LOCATION> to a tiny monastery in the pollution-clouded <LOCATION>Rio Tinto</LOCATION> valley,
we'll chase <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> around his old haunts, 499 years after he stepped aboard
the <LOCATION>Santa Maria</LOCATION> and sailed off to immortality.;    One of the big mysteries
about <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> has always been where he was born. The Italians insist he was
born in <LOCATION>Genoa</LOCATION> about <DATE>1451</DATE>, the son of <LOCATION>Domenico Colombo</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Susanna
Fontanarossa</PERSON>. His father, so one version goes, was a wool merchant and weaver
who caught the eye of the doge of <LOCATION>Genoa</LOCATION> and was made gatekeeper of the
Olivella Gate.;    Another version has him being a Jew born in <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>; another,
that he was non-Jewish, born in <LOCATION>Spain.</LOCATION>;    Or, even, would you believe,
Norwegian? Tor <PERSON>Borch Sannes</PERSON>, a Norwegian researcher of maritime history, says
in a new book that <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> was born in the small community of Hyen in
<LOCATION>Nordsfjord</LOCATION> in western <LOCATION>Norway</LOCATION>. He was named <PERSON>Christopher Bonde</PERSON>, a Norwegian name
meaning "farmer," but called himself <PERSON>Christopher Colon</PERSON> -- after "colonus," the
Latin word for farmer.;    The <PERSON>Bonde</PERSON> family, so this version goes, was
involved with the royal families of <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Norway</LOCATION> and left <LOCATION>Norway</LOCATION> for
<LOCATION>Genoa</LOCATION> in the <DATE>15th century</DATE> because of conflicts between the two royal
families.;    The Scandinavians have always been miffed that <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> gets all
the publicity for discovering the <LOCATION>Western Hemisphere</LOCATION>, citing fairly convincing
evidence that Viking sailors explored the New World around the year 1000,
almost 500 years before <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> sailed. (<PERSON>Stephen Birnbaum</PERSON> discusses this
issue, Page 2T.);    Italian historian <PERSON>Gianni Granzotto</PERSON>, in a <DATE>1984</DATE> biography,
says <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> began his sailing career as a boy, perhaps as young as 13,
accompanying wool shipments belonging to his father.;    Off to sea;    In
<DATE>1476</DATE>, according to American historian <PERSON>Samuel Eliot Morison</PERSON>, a Genoese convoy
<LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> was with was attacked by a Franco-Portuguese war fleet of about a
dozen vessels, and <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> was wounded in the battle. He escaped his sinking
ship and managed to swim and cling to an oar until he reached the shore of
<LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION> near <LOCATION>Lagos.</LOCATION>;    He apparently was not taken prisoner, because the
next year he sailed to <LOCATION>Iceland</LOCATION> and then moved back to <LOCATION>Lisbon</LOCATION> to take up work
as a chart maker and sailor.;    <PERSON>Granzotto</PERSON> opines that it was a move of
fateful consequence, because <LOCATION>Genoa</LOCATION> offered little incentive for
world-exploring voyages. <LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION>, on the other hand, was by this time a
center for maritime studies, and its explorers were at the forefront of the
epic voyages of discovery.;    After about eight years in <LOCATION>Lisbon</LOCATION>, plus a
marriage and a number of wide-ranging voyages, the saga now has <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>
starting his round of visits to the royal courts of <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, trying to get
monetary backing for a voyage to discover a western route to <LOCATION>India.</LOCATION>;    Myth
has it that he stood alone in the belief that the world was round, and was
turned down again and again by ignorant nobles unwilling to fight against
traditional geographers.;    In fact, most anybody with an ounce of education
believed by this time that the world was round. What <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> had to sell was
a new route, one that would be cheaper and more efficient than the overland
routes that had been used for centuries, or the new southern ocean route
around the tip of Africa.;    He first went to the king of <LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION> in <DATE>1483</DATE>.
The king, <PERSON>John II</PERSON>, was one of the many Portuguese monarchs who were ardent and
educated supporters of exploration, but he felt the <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> route was too
uncertain.;    Rejected, <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> tried next door, in <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>. In <DATE>1485</DATE>, he
arrived at <ORGANIZATION>Palos de la Frontera</ORGANIZATION>, a tiny port just across the <ORGANIZATION>Rio Tinto</ORGANIZATION> from
the Portuguese border. Near Palos was the monastery of La Rabida.;    A
devious schemer?;  Those who think <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> was a devious schemer believe his
arrival in the area was no quirk. At La Rabida were two prelates, Father
Antonio de <PERSON>Marchena</PERSON> and Father Juan Perez.;    De <PERSON>Marchena</PERSON> was a cosmographer,
a man popular at court and a man not ill at ease with the vision of a round
world. And <PERSON>Perez</PERSON> (the plot thickens) was Queen Isabella's personal confessor.;
   By <DATE>1486</DATE>, thanks to the two clergymen, <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> had been presented at court,
but not to the king and queen. Ferdinand and <PERSON>Isabella</PERSON> were busy kicking the
Moors out of <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>, and the siege of the last major Moorish stronghold,
<LOCATION>Granada</LOCATION>, was under way. Columbus had to wait until the expulsion was complete
-- a wait that lasted six years.;    In <DATE>April 1492</DATE>, the victorious <PERSON>Isabella</PERSON>
met <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> at the small village of <LOCATION>Santa Fe</LOCATION> near <LOCATION>Granada</LOCATION>, one of a series of
meetings the two had over the years. This time, she was ready to support the
scheme.;    But according to <LOCATION>Granzotto</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> made outrageous demands. In
exchange for royal backing, for example, he wanted <PERCENT>10 percent</PERCENT> of all profits
from the new world. He also wanted the title of Admiral of the <ORGANIZATION>Open Ocean</ORGANIZATION>. The
sovereigns eventually agreed, then later reneged on the deal, starting a
series of lawsuits between the <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> family and the crown of <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> still
not resolved.;    <PERSON>Isabella</PERSON> did not hock her jewels to pay for the trip, by the
way; her husband, <LOCATION>Ferdinand</LOCATION>, had to approve all bills, and in this case, the
money came from the royal treasury, and according to historian <PERSON>Morison</PERSON>, from
<LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> himself. The cost to obtain and outfit three ships? Morison says
<MONEY>$14,000</MONEY>.;    Because of crowded conditions in other ports, it was decided that
the voyage would commence from <ORGANIZATION>Palos de la Frontera</ORGANIZATION>. Isabella, one of
history's darker figures, was a violent anti-Semite who is given credit for
beginning the Spanish Inquisition and for formulating the <DATE>March 14, 1492</DATE>,
order for the expulsion of all Jews from Spain.;    ecause of that order, many
southern Spanish ports were filled with refugees; the two sovereigns finally
ordered all ships carrying Jewish exiles to leave port by <DATE>Aug. 2</DATE> -- the day
before <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> sailed.;    Land Ho!;  It took the three ships -- the immortal
<ORGANIZATION>Pinta</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Nina</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Santa Maria</LOCATION> -- more than 40 days to reach the Bahamas
(including a forced layover in the <LOCATION>Azores</LOCATION>). Ferdinand and <PERSON>Isabella</PERSON> had offered
a lifetime annuity to the first man to spy land in the <LOCATION>New World</LOCATION>. Granzotto
tells us it was Rodrigo de Triana aboard the <ORGANIZATION>Pinta</ORGANIZATION>. At <TIME>2 a.m.</TIME>, <DATE>Oct. 12, 1492</DATE>,
he yelled "Tierra, tierra!" And never got a dime.;    <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> later claimed
that he was the first to spot land. He said the previous evening, <DATE>Oct. 11</DATE>, he
had spotted a candle light on shore. Granzotto, noting that the ships were at
that point about 30 miles offshore, says it would have been impossible to see
the light. "A cruel abuse of power," he calls the action. Columbus kept the
prize.;    <DATE>Oct. 12</DATE> -- <LOCATION>Columbus Day</LOCATION> in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> -- he went ashore at
<LOCATION>San Salvador Island</LOCATION> in the <LOCATION>Bahamas</LOCATION> and claimed it for <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>. He and his crew
made the first recorded contact between Europeans and the natives of the <LOCATION>New
World</LOCATION> -- in this case, apparently, the Arawak Indians.;    <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> took
several Indians back to <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> with him and presented them at the royal court
in <LOCATION>Barcelona.</LOCATION>;    <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> made four more voyages to the new lands but
significantly never really recognized that two major land masses were nearby.;
   He explored many of the islands of the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> (and did step ashore in
what is now <LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION>) but found little gold and no proof at all that he had
discovered a new route to <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>. His health worsened (he caught malaria, had
gout and arthritis), and worse, the coral and sand islands of his new realm
yielded little that increased his fortunes.;    Royal displeasure;  Ferdinand
and Isabella were less than pleased by these voyages. On one, he lost a whole
fleet. On another, he was forced to deal with a mutiny that eventually saw him
returned to <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> in chains.;    The sovereigns had little to show for their
backing and were more and more reluctant to abide by their contract with
<LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>, especially the part that gave him <PERCENT>10 percent</PERCENT> of all the goodies
(such as they were) coming back from the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION>. Then his chief ally,
<LOCATION>Isabella</LOCATION>, died in <DATE>November 1504</DATE>, less than a month after his return from the
last voyage.;    He and <PERSON>Ferdinand</PERSON> fought a prolonged battle over what was owed
to whom, a battle that apparently worsened <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>' already frail health (he
was 53 at the time).;    In the <DATE>spring of 1505</DATE>, he moved to <LOCATION>Valladolid</LOCATION> in
northern <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>, where he died a year later. He died too soon to realize that
his dream of gold and glory was real, and that the new world was more than
sandy, barren islands in the middle of the ocean. Within 15 years, <PERSON>Hernan
Cortes</PERSON> had defeated the Aztecs and by <DATE>1532</DATE>, <PERSON>Juan Pizarro</PERSON> had taken control of
the Inca empire.;    Whether he was a gold-hungry, greedy con artist who sold
a bill of goods to a couple of naive monarchs, or a great mariner and
courageous explorer, continues to be a historic debate even today, almost five
centuries later.;    If Columbus/Colombo/Colon were around today, he might be
pleased to know his name is still widely known. Or he might just fly off to
<LOCATION>Madrid</LOCATION> to see <PERSON>King Juan Carlos</PERSON> and check on that <PERCENT>10 percent</PERCENT> he has coming.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  When he set sail with four small caravels on his final trip to the New World
in 1502, Christopher Columbus expected to find his long-sought shortcut to
Asia and emerge from the disgrace that less than two years before had seen him
stripped of honors and clapped in chains.;    Instead, with two leaking
caravels already abandoned in Panama after a year of perilous wandering, and
the remaining two no longer seaworthy, the ailing 52-year-old admiral and his
mutinous crew barely made it to the beach in this placid bay on the north
coast of Jamaica.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     But <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>' misfortune -- shipwrecked here for a year and five days only
"a crossbow shot," as his son phrased it, from a band of hostile Arawak
Indians -- may be a boon to <LOCATION>Jamaica</LOCATION> and a team of Texas-based marine
archaeologists. They believe they have found the spot where <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> ran the
two caravels aground 488 years ago.;    "We are <PERCENT>98 percent</PERCENT> sure they are
here," said <PERSON>Dr. James M. Parrent</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Institute of Nautical Archaeology</ORGANIZATION> at
<ORGANIZATION>Texas A&amp;M University</ORGANIZATION>, who, in cooperation with the government of <LOCATION>Jamaica</LOCATION>,
first began looking for the <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> caravels in <DATE>1982.</DATE>;    After starting work
in earnest <DATE>last summer</DATE>, <PERSON>Parrent</PERSON> said he hopes soon to unearth the keels and
some of the lower hull planking of the caravels "Capitana" and "<LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION> de
Palos" -- all that could be expected to remain after almost five centuries
under the bay's bottom -- for expert study and eventual display in a <LOCATION>Jamaica</LOCATION>
museum.;    "We are charged with locating perhaps the most important historic
archaeological site in the <LOCATION>New World</LOCATION>," <PERSON>Parrent</PERSON> said, noting that as the
quincentennial of <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>' first voyage in <DATE>1492</DATE> approaches, no other trace
has been found of the ships he sailed.;    They not only will be the oldest
European vessels discovered in the <LOCATION>Western Hemisphere</LOCATION> and the only ones
actually commanded by <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>, he said, they also will help solve a simple
question that has plagued naval architects and historians for centuries,
namely: What did a caravel look like?;    <LOCATION>The Nina</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Pinta</LOCATION> -- mainstays of
<LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>' first voyage, the Spanish-underwritten expedition that launched him
into Western lore as the finder of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> -- were fast-sailing caravels that
he preferred over the larger, more lumbering <LOCATION>Santa Maria</LOCATION>. Yet no reliable
drawing, painting or naval architect's plan of any of the vessels ever has
been found.;    Although divers have uncovered remains of other 16th-century
vessels thought to be similar to those sailed by <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>, there remains so
much uncertainty that every attempt to construct replicas, including several
now under way for quincentennial celebrations, has involved guesswork, <PERSON>Parrent</PERSON>
said.  </TEXT>

   LEISURE &amp; ARTS -- Television:
   Columbus and His Controversial Legacy
   ----
   By Dorothy Rabinowitz
</HL>

<SO>
WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A12
</SO>
<LP>
   Toward the very end of this documentary, a beaming Edward
I. Koch appears -- one of a group of people invited to give
their views on Columbus's legacy. Always a man to get down to
the real significance of events, Mr. Koch, who was then still
mayor of New York, observes, "If Christopher Columbus had not
crossed the seas in 1492, I would never have been the mayor.
Isn't that true?"
   It is a nice moment, the mayor in his old form. Besides,
by this time in the proceedings -- the end of a grandly
conceived, extraordinarily detailed seven-part PBS series --
we are about ready for a laugh. However, neither the National
Council of Churches, nor other Columbus bashers, will find
much to be amused at or to like in "Columbus and the Age of
Discovery," whose first two episodes aired last night.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Try though the film makers did to accommodate all views,
including the current politically correct one, the <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>
that emerges from this work is unmistakably a heroic figure,
whose achievement and historic legacy are eminently worthy of
celebration. This is not, of course, the view of the <ORGANIZATION>National
Council of Churches</ORGANIZATION>, which recently took occasion to express
its horror at the prospect of the quincentenary celebrations.
In keeping with the advanced political views for which it is
justly famed, the <ORGANIZATION>NCC</ORGANIZATION> declared that <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>'s arrival in the
<LOCATION>New World</LOCATION> was an occasion for "repentance" not celebration,
since <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>'s disovery had led to "genocide" as well as
"ecocide" and a host of other crimes against humanity too
numerous to mention here. The European discovery and
settlement of the New World was, in the view of the <ORGANIZATION>National
Council of Churches</ORGANIZATION>, "a historic tragedy."
   In this posture, the <ORGANIZATION>National Council of Churches</ORGANIZATION> is,
needless to say, not alone. The <ORGANIZATION>National Endowment</ORGANIZATION> for the
Humanities, the second largest financial supporter (after
<ORGANIZATION>Xerox</ORGANIZATION>) of "<LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> and the Age of Discovery," not long ago
refused to fund another film project because of its treatment
of <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>. In the opinion of that film maker too, <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>
was guilty of genocide -- a view, it need hardly be said, now
all the rage among the politically enlightened.
   The current PBS series doesn't neglect the ravages that
the age of discovery brought to the native peoples of the new
land. But neither, to its credit, does it neglect to note the
benefits the Europeans brought to the New World, and also
those they took from it. The most engrossing installment is
"The Columbian Exchange" (named after the <DATE>1972</DATE> book of the
same name, by <PERSON>Alfred W. Crosby</PERSON>, on which it is based). This
segment, which airs tomorrow night as part six, follows the
journey of the potato, of which Europeans were ignorant till
it was brought to their shores from the <LOCATION>New World</LOCATION>. The
potato, discovered in the <LOCATION>Andes</LOCATION>, became the subsistence crop
that fed and enlarged the population of <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>. This
impressive episode (the script was written by <PERSON>Graham Chedd</PERSON>)
also delivers a shattering history of the Irish potato
famine. It connects events and consequences, something that
this documentary does, on the whole, very well.
   The potato famine brought the migration from <LOCATION>Ireland</LOCATION> to
<LOCATION>America</LOCATION>. African slaves worked and died on the sugar
plantations of the New World. But -- as this production makes
clear -- the <LOCATION>New World</LOCATION> also introduced the corn and cassava
that would become the mainstays of the African food supply.
The series (produced by <PERSON>Zvi Dor-Ner</PERSON>) often feels like a
return visit -- a fascinating one to be sure -- to the
gradeschool classroom, where teachers once taught geography
and history and where -- so we are assured -- it is still
taught.
   The series is at its best in this factual mode. On the
other hand, nothing in the script equals the power of the
readings from <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>'s diary of his voyage: "<DATE>Sunday</DATE>,
<DATE>September 16, 1492</DATE>. Today there were some clouds and it was a
great delight to enjoy the morning. Nothing was lacking but
to hear the nightingales."
   At its worst, the script can get to be like a good part of
tonight's first hour, titled "The Crossing." Here we are
dragged aground, through the Spanish navy's commemoration of
the <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> quincentenary. Captains and crews man replicas
of the <ORGANIZATION>Nina</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Pinta</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Santa Maria</LOCATION> and attempt to retrace
<LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>'s first voyage. If there were any justice in the
world, a special place in hell would be reserved for the
person who invented dramatic re-enactments. Granted,
television requires pictures, which this sort of re-creation
can provide, but such pictures come at a high cost to
authenticity. Parts of the re-enactment of <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>'s voyage,
in fact, seem positively unhinged. At one point, a sonorous
voice declares that "many things have changed in 500 years,
but not the pattern of life on a sailing vessel" -- a message
accompanied by footage of a sailor in yuppie athletic togs
doing his situps. Also helping to put us in the historical
mood is the pop vocal blaring from the <LOCATION>Nina</LOCATION> or maybe it's the
<LOCATION>Pinta</LOCATION>. In one corner of the deck on which <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>'s men are
supposed to be sailing, a sailor sits playing "As Time Goes
By" on his trumpet. Yes, we can feel the 15th century all
around us. At another point, we are privileged to see a power
boat draw near one of the <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> replicas -- and to learn
that it carries one sailor's girlfriend and his parents, on
an outing.
   In short, this production has its flaws. Some are simply
annoyances, such as the repetition of cautious formulations
designed to avoid offending any political side. Columbus is
forever being described as a man who changed the course of
history "for better or for worse" or its equivalents -- of
which there are many. And -- not to be stuffy -- but is it
asking too much of a PBS film into which millions were poured
that its writers have enough of a grasp of English usage to
keep them from producing lines such as the one that informs
us that <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> was so rushed, he had no time "to
contemplate the enormity of his journey?"
   Flaws and annoyances aside, this exploration of <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>
and the New World is a major achievement, a fact that becomes
increasingly evident in the final three hours, which air
<DATE>Tuesday</DATE> and <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> nights. At the end, the film's effort
to maintain an even keel in all political directions finally
yields, as the narrator, with some passion, utters the last
line: "So let us commemorate -- and yes, celebrate
<PERSON>Christopher Columbus</PERSON>." If this portrait is the worst thing to
happen to <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> and his legacy in the months to come, we
will have reason to be grateful.

PROTOCOL: THE CITY AND COUNTY ARE FIGHTING OVER WHO GETS THE SPOILS FROM 
CELEBRATION OF 500TH ANNIVERSARY OF COLUMBUS' VOYAGE.

<TEXT>
<P>
Although the 500th anniversary of <PERSON>Christopher Columbus</PERSON>' discovery of the <LOCATION>New 
World</LOCATION> is still two years away, the city and county are engaged in what one 
official calls a "protocol war" over control of <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>' celebration. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor <PERSON>Tom Bradley</PERSON> said it was insulting that a federal commission selected the 
<ORGANIZATION>County Board of Supervisors</ORGANIZATION> as the local coordinator for the <DATE>1992</DATE> celebration. 
</P>
<P>
Unless the commission reconsiders, the mayor's office said, the city will drop 
out of the celebration, whose main event will be a parade of tall ships, led by 
replicas of the <ORGANIZATION>Nina</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Pinta</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Santa Maria</LOCATION>, which will sail into <LOCATION>Long Beach 
Harbor</LOCATION> and other ports around the country, but not <LOCATION>Los Angeles Harbor</LOCATION>, 
according to the mayor's office. 
</P>
<P>
City pride and tourist dollars are at stake, according to <PERSON>Bradley</PERSON>'s chief of 
protocol, <PERSON>Beatrice Canterbury Lavery</PERSON>. "This is not a silly fight between the 
offices of protocol," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But Supervisor <PERSON>Ed Edelman</PERSON> said, "Egos are involved." 
</P>
<P>
"These protocol wars should cease," <PERSON>Edelman</PERSON> added. "Every time I talk to 
diplomats here, they tell me they're always in the middle between the city and 
county." 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors established their own office of protocol in <DATE>1983</DATE> after 
receiving what they considered casual treatment during a visit to <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> 
by <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s Queen Elizabeth. 
</P>
<P>
While <PERSON>Bradley</PERSON> played host to the queen and repeatedly was photographed at her 
side, the supervisors had to remind city officials to include them on the 
invitation list for a small luncheon planned for her at the <ORGANIZATION>Music Center</ORGANIZATION>, a 
county-run facility. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the city and county offices of protocol have clashed over such 
things as who should be first to greet visiting dignitaries and seating 
arrangements at dinners, according to officials who were present. 
</P>
<P>
In the latest dispute, <PERSON>Bradley</PERSON> said he was shocked by the selection of the 
county to coordinate <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>' celebration -- especially after he traveled 
to <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> last year to discuss the city's plans for the event with <PERSON>King Juan 
Carlos I.</PERSON> 
</P>
<P>
The designation was awarded in <DATE>April</DATE> by the federal <ORGANIZATION>Christopher Columbus 
Quincentenary Jubilee Commission</ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The county's volunteer chief of protocol, <PERSON>Sandra J. Ausman</PERSON>, said: "The 
commission wanted a governmental body that had the ability to bring together 
all the cities of the county. 
</P>
<P>
"This (celebration) belongs to everyone," she said. "It doesn't belong to one 
city." 
</P>
<P>
But <PERSON>Bradley</PERSON>, in a strongly worded letter to the commission, pointed out that 
the city spent three years planning for the celebration. 
</P>
<P>
"It was even more insulting that this decision was made without our knowledge 
or consultation," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
The city should run the celebration because it was founded by the King of 
<LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>, said <PERSON>Lavery</PERSON>, who is paid <MONEY>$56,104</MONEY> a year. 
</P>
<P>
"We are the Spanish city," she said. "The county is not a Spanish county." 
</P>
<P>
Lavery complained that the county "never informed us they were going to compete 
with us. . . . The county keeps trying to come into our territory. I don't 
interfere in their territory." 
</P>
<P>
County protocol chief <PERSON>Ausman</PERSON> said the county offered to coordinate the event 
after being approached by a commission official and a Spanish diplomat who 
complained that the city was not making enough progress. Supervisor <PERSON>Mike 
Antonovich</PERSON> added that members of <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>' Italian community also complained 
to him about the city's efforts to honor the Genovese sailor <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Jana Joustra</PERSON>, the commission's public relations director, said: "We felt the 
ball had been dropped by the city. I don't know what they have been doing for 
three years, but they haven't been doing it with us." 
</P>
<P>
Last month's choice of the <ORGANIZATION>Republican-dominated Board of Supervisors</ORGANIZATION> over the 
Democrat <PERSON>Bradley</PERSON> had nothing to do with politics, <PERSON>Joustra</PERSON> said. The commission, 
although appointed by Republican President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>, is bipartisan, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The county has established a local committee to plan events and raise private 
funds for the celebration. At least <MONEY>$2 million</MONEY> is needed to pay for the ships' 
visit, <PERSON>Ausman</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
The replicas will duplicate <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>' voyage across the <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> from <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>. 
They will sail into <LOCATION>New York Harbor</LOCATION> on <DATE>July 4, 1992</DATE>, then travel through the

   To Honor Columbus, Teams
   Design Sailboats to Mars,
   But the Obstacle Is Money

   About this time of year in 1490, Columbus was chewing his
fingernails in Salamanca, Spain, waiting for a royal
commission to advise Ferdinand and Isabella on whether they
should finance his proposed voyage west to reach the East.
   Half a millennium later, dozens of amateur and
professional space enthusiasts await word of who, if anyone,
will finance a voyage that seems almost as far-fetched: a
race to Mars by solar-sailing spaceships.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Early last year, these space fans' imaginations were
grabbed by a proposal from the <ORGANIZATION>Christopher Columbus
Quincentenary Jubilee Commission</ORGANIZATION>. To mark the Italian's
discovery, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> group suggested, teams from around the
world would build and launch in <DATE>October 1992</DATE> a fleet of three
small spaceships unlike any ever seen.
   Once in space, each of these unmanned ships would unfurl
thousands of square yards of gossamer sails that would billow
out under the almost infinitesimal pressure of sunlight.
Driven only by light bouncing off the sails' surfaces and
steered from Earth by electronic tillers and mainsheets, the
ships would tack past the moon and head for the red planet.
   The team whose sailing ship made the quickest transit from
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> to Mars would claim the first Columbus 500 Space Sail
Cup, a trophy that would be put up for grabs every 10 years.
   At least that was the plan the <ORGANIZATION>Jubilee Commission</ORGANIZATION> put
forth in late <DATE>1988</DATE>. Fascinated by the idea, space cadets of
all ages and disciplines rushed to their computers and
drawing boards. Last <DATE>November</DATE>, a committee of experts picked
the preliminary designs of eight teams -- three from the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
and one each from <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> and the
<LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> -- that seemed to have a chance of actually
making it to Mars.
   But alas, history repeats itself. Many of the would-be
space sailors say they feel the kind of letdown <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> must
have felt in <DATE>1486</DATE> when a rich Spaniard, the <ORGANIZATION>Conde de Medina
Celi</ORGANIZATION>, backed out on a promise to lend him some caravels.
   When the <ORGANIZATION>Quincentenary Commission</ORGANIZATION> called for design
proposals last year, "it indicated it was going to raise
funds," says <PERSON>Harold Fox</PERSON>, director of the solar sail project
for the <ORGANIZATION>Applied Physics Laboratory</ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION>Johns Hopkins
University</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION>. Scientists and engineers at the
laboratory rounded up government, industrial and university
space enthusiasts in <LOCATION>Maryland</LOCATION> and designed a <MONEY>$15 million</MONEY>
solar sail.
   But "they busted the bubble" a month ago, <PERSON>Mr. Fox</PERSON> says of
the commission's <ORGANIZATION>Columbus 500 Space Sail Project</ORGANIZATION>. Not only
did the project's director reveal that no money had been
raised, <PERSON>Mr. Fox</PERSON> says, but "the teams were encouraged to seek
funding on their own." The disappointed <PERSON>Johns Hopkins/APL</PERSON>
team is talking to some potential donors, he says. "We'll
give it a couple more months," but if funds aren't in sight
by then, the project will be shelved, he says.
   "I'm enthusiastic and I'd love to see it happen, but I'm
not into fund raising," says <PERSON>Andreas von Flotow</PERSON>, professor of
astronautics at <ORGANIZATION>Massachusetts Institute of Technology</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Cambridge</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Mr. von Flotow</PERSON> and a graduate student will
spend the <DATE>summer</DATE> working on their concept of a <MONEY>$3 million</MONEY>
"heliogyro" with eight 250-foot bladelike sails. But that's
the most he can do without funding, he says.
   A Canadian team has obtained about <MONEY>$3 million</MONEY> worth of
hardware and services promised from corporations and this
month will test the waters of Canadian nationalism by
launching a public fund-raising drive. "If we can get nominal
cash donations from 100,000 individuals," then <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> can
launch its own <MONEY>$9.6 million</MONEY> (Canadian) entry in the race,
says <PERSON>Steve Horvath</PERSON>, a computer expert who heads the <ORGANIZATION>Canadian
Solar Sail Project</ORGANIZATION> organized by the <ORGANIZATION>Canadian Space Society</ORGANIZATION>.
   Fittingly, it's the Italians who seem really committed.
"We accepted with enthusiasm to do this space sailing to
Mars," says <PERSON>Joseph Viriglio</PERSON>, managing director of the space
systems group at <ORGANIZATION>Aeritalia</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Turin</LOCATION> aerospace company.
<ORGANIZATION>Aeritalia</ORGANIZATION> is leading an industrial consortium to build and
launch a <MONEY>$20 million</MONEY> space sailer to be named the <ORGANIZATION>Capitana
Italica</ORGANIZATION>, the other name for the <LOCATION>Santa Maria</LOCATION>. "We are quite
confident of raising the money," <PERSON>Mr. Viriglio</PERSON> says.
   The man who dreamed up the race and heads the <ORGANIZATION>Columbus 500
Space Sail Project</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Klaus P. Heiss</PERSON>, remains optimistic. <PERSON>Mr.
Heiss</PERSON> is a mathematical economist who has worked on the
economics of a number of space projects, including the space
shuttle. He concedes the project doesn't yet have any money,
but says "funding is being strongly pursued" and a
fund-raising consortium will be organized by early <DATE>July</DATE>. The
project, he says, is still planning to get three ships,
including at least one from <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION>, ready to launch in
<DATE>October 1992</DATE>. "It can be done if we have <MONEY>$25 million</MONEY> in
cash," he says.
   The idea of sailing through interplanetary space on puffs
of light is far from new, but it's never been tried.
Scientists have known since the <DATE>turn of the century</DATE> that when
light reflects off an object it exerts pressure on that
object. In the <DATE>1920s</DATE>, the details of sun sailing in space
were worked out by two Russians, <PERSON>Konstantin Tsiolkovsky</PERSON> (a
schoolteacher who earlier had devised a remarkably prescient
way to rocket men to the moon) and <PERSON>Fridrikh Tsander</PERSON>, a
mathematician.
   Enthusiasts, however, say a <DATE>1951</DATE> article in Astounding
magazine by scientist and science-fiction writer <PERSON>Carl A.
Wiley</PERSON> gave birth to present concepts of solar sails. And they
trace the idea of a race to a <DATE>1963</DATE> <PERSON>Arthur C. Clarke</PERSON>
science-fiction story about an <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s Cup-type race to the
moon among seven space sailors.
   In "The Wind From the Sun," <PERSON>Mr. Clarke</PERSON> noted that the
pressure of sunlight on one's hand was about a millionth of
an ounce. With this minuscule pressure applied to two square
miles of a sail in space, the sail would move about an inch
in the first second and about 60 feet in the first minute,
<PERSON>Mr. Clarke</PERSON> calculated. In an hour it would accelerate to 80
miles per hour, and by the end of the day the ship would be
traveling 2,000 mph -- and the speed would continue to build
day after day.
   The sails could be maneuvered by changing their angle to
the sun's rays, just as a sailing ship maneuvers in the wind.
Power to change the angles of the sail, "trimming" it, as
well as power for communications, could come from
solar-electric cells. Thus, the sail could flit through space
without a drop of fuel.
   All this prompted <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> in the late <DATE>1970s</DATE> to commission Jet
Propulsion Laboratories in <LOCATION>Pasadena</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, to design a
solar sailship to rendezvous with <PERSON>Halley</PERSON>'s Comet when it came
by in <DATE>1986</DATE>. Unlike rocket-launched probes that could only fly
by, a sail ship could maneuver about the comet for several
days.
   The <PERSON>Halley</PERSON>'s project foundered on a budget reef. But the
idea fascinated a group of space enthusiasts in <LOCATION>Southern
California</LOCATION>, who organized the <ORGANIZATION>World Space Foundation</ORGANIZATION> and
built what is still the world's only space-sail manufacturing
machine. In <DATE>1981</DATE> they actually built a 50-foot-square
prototype solar sail of aluminized Mylar plastic, which was
unfurled once, in a gymnasium.
   Designing "sunjammers," as they were dubbed in a <DATE>1964</DATE>
science-fiction story by <PERSON>Poul Anderson</PERSON>, is far from simple.
To get the most sail area per pound of spacecraft weight, the
sail must be tissue-thin. Proposed sails are huge, with
diameters and diagonals three to seven times the length of
the 117-foot <LOCATION>Santa Maria</LOCATION>. The Canadians' hexagonal sail would
cover 12,000 square yards, while the disk-shaped one designed
by <ORGANIZATION>Cambridge Consultants Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> would cover 15
acres, or 11 football fields.
   Yet the sails are so light they must be unfurled at least
1,000 miles above the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s surface, where there's not the
slightest wisp of atmosphere to drag them down. This altitude
is beyond the reach of the space shuttle, so ships must be
launched by rocket.
   The trickiest part of the whole race is unfurling the
giant sails after they've been packed into a nose cone.
<ORGANIZATION>Cambridge Consultants</ORGANIZATION> designed its sail, dubbed the <ORGANIZATION>Nina</ORGANIZATION>,
with 36 elastic ribs wound around a central hub, with the
sail folded up between the ribs. In space the ribs would
<DATE>spring</DATE> out radially from the hub.
   The Johns Hopkins/APL team figures its sail will have to
spend 60 to 90 days in a steadily elongating elliptical orbit
before it has enough speed to break free of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s gravity.
If it breaks loose at just the right moment, it will be
grabbed by the moon's gravity and whipped out on a course to
<ORGANIZATION>Mars</ORGANIZATION>, getting there in maybe 400 to 500 days.
   If past is prologue, the would-be space sailors are in for
at least one more disappointment. The finalists are to be
picked this <DATE>October</DATE>, by which time <PERSON>Mr. Heiss</PERSON>'s promised
consortium should know its prospects for funds. This is 500
years almost to the month from the report of the <ORGANIZATION>Talavera
Committee on Columbus</ORGANIZATION>' request. The committee told <ORGANIZATION>Ferdinand</ORGANIZATION>
and <PERSON>Isabella</PERSON> that it wasn't proper for them "to favor an
affair that rested on such weak foundations and which
appeared uncertain and impossible to any educated person,
however little learning he might have."
   And President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> doesn't have any jewels to hock.

THE WORLD'S most sophisticated railway lines run up to it. <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>'s newest
airport was built for it. <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>'s best roads have just reached it. What if
no one comes to it?
Of course they will] Welcome to the <DATE>1992</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>Universal Exposition</ORGANIZATION>, or Expo <DATE>'92</DATE>,
in <LOCATION>Seville</LOCATION>, the biggest, certainly the most expensive, and easily the most
rapidly assembled celebration of any single event, probably, in human
history.
The cost? About Dollars 9bn, but who's counting? It is too easy to knock
Expo - it is a big, brash, fabulous waste of money  - and much harder to
appreciate what its success means to <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>.
This is a country gripped by one dominating and rampaging anxiety - what do
other people think of it? Hardly a week goes by in <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> without a symposium
somewhere devoted to this very serious matter. Its newspapers write articles
about what foreign newspapers write about <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>.
Now, in these few days before Expo opens and the country's <DATE>1992</DATE> celebrations
(including the Olympics in <LOCATION>Barcelona</LOCATION> in <DATE>July</DATE>) really get underway, <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> is
fluffing its skirts and patting its hair like a young lady preparing for her
first date, hoping to get a glimpse of herself in a nice big mirror before
the night is over.
Expo and the foreigners that go to it are that mirror. By Expo's success and
by the smiles on the faces of its visitors, <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>, or a large part of it,
will judge itself. Spaniards know that many northern Europeans think they
are a lazy, good for nothing and untrustworthy lot.
It is nonsense, of course, but there have been some horrible moments along
the way to Expo: when a terrible fire, caused by careless working practices,
destroyed one of the Expo's most important pavilions in <DATE>February</DATE>, the press
was vicious.
'<ORGANIZATION>Chapuza Nacional</ORGANIZATION>' screamed one - national cock-up  - as if to say it before
some foreigner did. Earlier a replica of the first ship to sail round the
world toppled over moments after being launched and some crew in replicas of
<LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>'s three ships tried to run away when they reached the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>.
About 18m people, the organisers say, will go to <LOCATION>Seville</LOCATION> to meander about
the town and the Expo site between its opening on <DATE>April 20</DATE> and its closure
176 days later on <DATE>October 12</DATE>, 500 years to the day that <PERSON>Christopher Columbus</PERSON>
first set foot in the new World.
The site is <LOCATION>Cartuja Island</LOCATION>, once home to a monastery where <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> often
rested after his great voyages. The 450 hectare island sits in the middle of
the <LOCATION>Guadalquivir River</LOCATION> that skirts <LOCATION>Seville</LOCATION> and up which eventually sailed
gold-laden galleons for the century or so in which <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> was able to reap
maximum benefit from the colonisation of <LOCATION>Latin America</LOCATION> that <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> had
begun.
The monastery still stands, but dwarfed by the incredible Expo city that has
been built around it. It is impossible to stand in the middle of it - even
while frantic last-minute preparations continued  - and not be thrilled by
the sheer scale of what has been put down on Cartuja and the speed with
which it has been done.
Just <DATE>18 months ago Cartuja</DATE> was little more than a swampy bulldozed mess. In
four days time the Expo will open its 95 pavilions, 70 bars, 150 shops,
40,000-place car park, 16 banks to the public. Somehow, the organisers have
managed to squeeze in 55,000 different pieces of entertainment at 21 stages
dotted around the site. The <ORGANIZATION>New York Metropolitan Opera</ORGANIZATION> will be coming, and
so will opera from <LOCATION>Vienna</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Dresden</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Milan</LOCATION>. <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Tobago</LOCATION> are
sending a steel band.
The whole point is that everyone is coming and Expo '92 is probably going to
be the last truly great cultural statement of this century. It is not, or it
should not be, a trade fair. It is a celebration of knowledge and,
specifically, discovery. The country, theme and corporate pavilions may not
push the barriers of architectural knowledge beyond what we already know,
but nowhere on earth are the eccentric and conventional forms and structures
of the late 20th century so brilliantly scrambled together. At the risk of
sounding like a publicist, Expo promises to be terrific fun.
This is, after all, <LOCATION>Andalucia</LOCATION>. The incredible noise on the streets and in
the bars of <LOCATION>Seville</LOCATION> could just as easily be the sound of <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>'s beating
heart. These people taught the rest of <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> the meaning of fiesta.
Visitors might find <LOCATION>Seville</LOCATION> a little cramped - not any more so than during
its Easter fiesta - but it is the smallest city ever to host a <ORGANIZATION>Universal
Exposition</ORGANIZATION> and it has managed to attract the greatest number of countries to
take part. One result will be a great shortage of accommodation and what is
available will be very expensive.
For most of the time the fair is opened, it will also be unspeakably hot.
That partly explains why the Expo site will be open until four in the
morning every day and also why the organisers felt it necessary to plant
350,000 trees and shrubs around the site. Shade will be Expo's most valuable
commodity.
Just how valuable the Expo is to <LOCATION>Seville</LOCATION> is already easy to measure. It was
<PERSON>King Juan Carlos</PERSON> who first suggested (naturally, when one is the <PERSON>King</PERSON>, one's
ideas are always one's very own ideas) holding an Expo at <LOCATION>Seville</LOCATION> in <DATE>1992</DATE>.
That was in the late <DATE>1970s</DATE>. But it was the election of the socialist
government, led by Prime Minister <PERSON>Felipe Gonzalez</PERSON>, in <DATE>1982</DATE> that really set
things moving.
<PERSON>Mr Gonzalez</PERSON> and his most senior advisers were all Andalucians in the early
years and they have bent over backwards to make sure that, along with the
Expo, <LOCATION>Andalucia</LOCATION> in <DATE>1992</DATE> would be used to mark the return of <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> to
prominence as a major economic and democratic power. Their <LOCATION>Andalucia</LOCATION> was
(and still is) a largely poor, dry and illiterate place. It has bred some
wonderful people but given them precious little to live off.
So <LOCATION>Andalucia</LOCATION> has been showered with gifts for this year. Easily the most
exotic is the world's newest high-speed train line, between <LOCATION>Madrid</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Seville</LOCATION>, with a branch to the Expo entrance.
Just outside <LOCATION>Seville</LOCATION>, where the airport was once little more than a
blockhouse, stands a spanking new terminal capable of taking 8m passengers a
year.
After the Expo, it could take <LOCATION>Seville</LOCATION> 20 years to use that airport to
capacity. Around the city are nearly 70km of new roads and eight new bridges
cross the Guadalquivir, while five new highways connect <LOCATION>Seville</LOCATION> with
<LOCATION>Andalucia</LOCATION>'s other great centres and with <LOCATION>Madrid</LOCATION>.
This is <LOCATION>Andalucia</LOCATION>'s big chance. It has become fashionable to speak of
<LOCATION>Andalucia</LOCATION> as <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>'s next, or first, <LOCATION>Silicon Valley</LOCATION>. But it may just find
the imagination needed to turn the infrastructure it has been showered with
in the past few years to its advantage once all the visitors have gone.
The Expo organisers have already established a project - <DATE>Cartuja 93</DATE>  - which
is designed to preserve the Expo site more or less intact for use as a base
for research and study. <LOCATION>Andalucia</LOCATION> has never shown much interest in the
future, but <LOCATION>Cartuja</LOCATION> may change that.
Just as it may change the way Spaniards think about their past. What is
being celebrated here is <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>'s discovery of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>, or what he thought
was the East, and the firm establishment, for arguably the first time, of
true democracy in <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>. Both are important, for the Expo has neatly
coincided with an intense effort by <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> to reconnect itself with its
former colonies in <LOCATION>Latin America</LOCATION>, which now account for just 3 per cent of
<LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>'s trade.
<LOCATION>Latin America</LOCATION> holds up a rather different mirror to <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> than do its
admiring European partners. It is an older mirror, perhaps darker too. The
devastation wrought by the Conquistadores on the native populations of the
countries they invaded still provokes quick and fiery argument in <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>.
Should <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> feel shame at that memory? Surely not now, just as it has been
able to welcome back and legalise the Jews 500 years after their expulsion
by <ORGANIZATION>Ferdinand</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Isabella</LOCATION>.
This is not a very contemplative society, but Spaniards who think about
themselves might want to extract as much as they can from the Latin
Americans who come to <LOCATION>Seville</LOCATION>. That continent's chaos, its struggle for
democracy, has a frighteningly clear reflection in <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> as well. Some
people think they know why - that by the time the Conquistadores sallied
forth democracy in <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> had already been lost as a trade off for land and
title.
That notion is suspect simply for being so neat and tidy and the lessons to
be drawn from what <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> began 500 years ago in <LOCATION>Latin America</LOCATION> are not
easily defined. The Spanish started planning for <DATE>1992</DATE> calling it the year of
Discovery until South Americans reminded Spaniards that people were living
in the new world long before <DATE>1492</DATE>. <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> changed the theme of <DATE>1992</DATE>, then, to
the Re-encounter. That seems more apt and, even if it says nothing much, it
is at least a mark of a new humility.

<TEXT>
   <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>'s plans to stage a
headline-grabbing 500th birthday party for <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> in <DATE>1992</DATE> have
stirred up a storm of controversy over how <LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION> is celebrating
its own discoverers, who were charting the <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> before
<PERSON>Christopher Columbus</PERSON> was born.
   <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION> were archrivals in the push in the 15th and
16th centuries to sail off the end of known maps and find new
worlds. Both succeeded.
   But now, many Portuguese fear their neighbors are stealing the
limelight for the <DATE>1992</DATE> fiesta.
   At the center of <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>'s celebrations is <LOCATION>Seville</LOCATION>'s Expo <DATE>'92</DATE>, a
530-acre international fair that is set to end a six-month run <DATE>Oct.
12, 1992</DATE>, 500 years to the day after <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> reached the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION>
island of <LOCATION>San Salvador</LOCATION>.
   Also making <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> hot property in <DATE>1992</DATE> will be the excitement of
the Summer Olympic games in <LOCATION>Barcelona</LOCATION>. And the <ORGANIZATION>European Economic
Community</ORGANIZATION> has chosen <LOCATION>Madrid</LOCATION> as its cultural capital on the eve of
the trading bloc's deadline to create a single European market.
   Compared with all that, <LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION>'s <DATE>1992</DATE> celebrations seem
lackluster.
   <LOCATION>Lisbon</LOCATION>'s government-appointed <ORGANIZATION>National Discoveries Commission</ORGANIZATION> is
promoting research, exhibitions and the publishing of more history
books about the era.
   It has commissioned American composer <PERSON>Philip Glass</PERSON> to write an
opera for <DATE>1992</DATE> release, based probably on the Lusiads _ an epic
poem about <PERSON>Vasco da Gama</PERSON>'s voyages that was written by <LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION>'s
16th century roving bard, <PERSON>Luis de Camoes</PERSON>.
   But the Spaniards got there first by casting Catalan soprano
<ORGANIZATION>Montserrat Caballe</ORGANIZATION> and tenor <PERSON>Jose Carreras</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Cristobal Colon</LOCATION>, an
opera based on trials and tribulations of the Genoese captain. It
sold out when it premiered in <LOCATION>Barcelona</LOCATION> in <DATE>September</DATE>.
   News media, executives and even historians here have called for
more glamour to promote <LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION>'s past glories and to show that it
is a rapidly modernizing European country.
   ``I'm ashamed at how my country is celebrating the
discoveries,'' said <PERSON>Waldemar de Abreu</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Lisbon</LOCATION> publisher and
editor of ``The Portuguese Christopher Columbus _ Secret Agent of
<PERSON>King Dom Joao II</PERSON>,'' a 600-page book that claims proof the explorer
was Portuguese.
   ``<LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION> could easily have pooled resources with <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> and
staged an Iberian discoveries exhibition in <DATE>1992</DATE>,'' de <PERSON>Abreu</PERSON> said.
   While admitting <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> ``is pegging all the force of its
modernization on <DATE>1992</DATE>,'' <PERSON>Vasco Graca Moura</PERSON>, head of the
<ORGANIZATION>Commission</ORGANIZATION>'s executive board, makes no apologies for not going
overboard in that year.
   ``The main difference is that <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> is only commemorating one
date and a short journey _ <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>' voyage in <DATE>1492</DATE> to the <LOCATION>West
Indies</LOCATION>,'' he said.
   ``Our celebrations began last year with <ORGANIZATION>Bartolomeu Dias</ORGANIZATION> and will
only end in <DATE>2000</DATE>, with <PERSON>Pedro Alvares Cabral</PERSON>.''
   Spurred by their pioneering Prince <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> the Navigator's studies
of astronomy and cartography, Portuguese seafarers had claimed the
island of <LOCATION>Madeira</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>mid-Atlantic Azores</LOCATION> archipelago by <DATE>1430</DATE>.
   Dias took his ship around the <LOCATION>Cape</LOCATION> of Good Hope in <DATE>1488</DATE>, leaving
da <LOCATION>Gama</LOCATION> to open up the sea route to <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> <DATE>10 years later</DATE>.
   Cabral discovered <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> in <DATE>1500</DATE>, the Portuguese went east of
<LOCATION>India</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, and <PERSON>Fernao de Magalhaes</PERSON> _ better known as <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>
_ closed the Discoveries circle in <DATE>1520</DATE> by commanding the first
expedition to sail around the world.
   ``Our commemorations match our dimension _ we're smaller than
<LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>, so honestly we can't be as elaborate,'' said the
commission's <PERSON>Antonio Mega Ferreira</PERSON>, though adding <LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION> still
has a few tricks up its sleeve.
   <LOCATION>Lisbon</LOCATION> <DATE>last week</DATE> submitted its candidacy to the Paris-based
<ORGANIZATION>International Exhibitions Bureau</ORGANIZATION>, to hold Expo '98 _ a three-month,
international fair, only about a tenth the size of <LOCATION>Seville</LOCATION>.
   Instead of trying for the Olympics, <LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION> is expected to bid
in <DATE>January</DATE> to hold soccer's World Cup in <DATE>1998</DATE>.
   Expo <DATE>'98</DATE>'s theme will be East meets West, its hero _ Vasco da
Gama. Graca Moura argues da <PERSON>Gama</PERSON>'s trips to the Orient were as
important as <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>' discovery in the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION>.
   Mega <PERSON>Ferreira</PERSON>'s plans for Expo '98 include a subway train
connecting the undeveloped left bank of the Tagus estuary with
<LOCATION>Lisbon</LOCATION>'s historic <LOCATION>Belem</LOCATION> district.
   <LOCATION>Belem</LOCATION> is already the site of three ornate monuments to the
discoveries _ <LOCATION>Belem</LOCATION> tower and Jeronimos monastery, and former
dictator <PERSON>Antonio Oliveira Salazar</PERSON>'s colossal, caravel-shaped
``Padrao'' _ a pillar that navigators used to leave behind them on
land to mark the spread of the Portuguese empire.
   Salazar in <DATE>1940</DATE> organized an exhibition called ``O Mundo
Portugues'' _ the Portuguese world, that glorified the country's
discoveries and African empire to distract attention from its
isolation in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> and World War II that was going on around it.
   ``The (center-right) government has a complex of being linked to
<PERSON>Salazar</PERSON>. They're frightened they'd be accused of nationalism, if
they did more to glorify our history,'' de <PERSON>Abreu</PERSON> said. ``But
nobody's accusing <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>'s socialist government of anything, and
what is <LOCATION>Seville</LOCATION> if not a glorification of <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>'s colonial past?''

<TEXT>     But now, in what many see as a classic morality tale of greed and
overreaching ambition, the presidential commission in charge of the
celebration is in shambles, its only big sponsor is refusing to shell out any
more money and its former chairman, <PERSON>John Goudie</PERSON>, is under federal
investigation for alleged financial improprieties.;    <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> officials
have  been left scrambling to save their mega-buck event, even as they try to
distance themselves from the scandal surrounding deals made under <PERSON>Goudie</PERSON>. They
must, by their own estimate, raise <MONEY>$15 million</MONEY> for the local celebration,
which few people have even heard of.;    "We aren't tainted by them," said
<PERSON>Michael Housh</PERSON>, an assistant to Mayor Art Agnos who handled <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>'s
<DATE>1988</DATE> bid to the national commission.;    But at the same time individuals and
groups around the country were refusing to do business with <PERSON>Goudie</PERSON> because of
what they allege were unethical requests from him, <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> alone among
the cities vying for <ORGANIZATION>Columbus Day</ORGANIZATION> was willing -- even eager -- to entertain
unusual demands by the chairman to pay the commission cash up front.;    The
world's most; dazzling event ever;    The quincentenary celebration of
<LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>' voyage to <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> had been promoted -- initially by <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>, later by
other countries including the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> -- as the most dazzling event of
its kind the world had ever seen. Bigger than the Bicentennial. Bigger than
the Statue of Liberty party.;    By one account, <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> commissions had been
organized in 30 countries, 39 states and 100 cities. Exhibits, movies, tours,
medallions, mugs, T-shirts, sporting events, operas, conferences, books,
scholarships, contests, parties -- the multibillion-dollar <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>
celebration would have it all.;    And everyone wanted a piece of it.;    The
centerpiece of the pageant was to be the re-creation of the historical voyage
itself: Replicas of the <ORGANIZATION>Nina</ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION>Pinta</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Santa Maria</LOCATION> would sail from
<LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>, host of the <DATE>1992</DATE> World's Fair and Summer Olympics, and make their way
to the <LOCATION>Western Hemisphere</LOCATION>, visiting 50 <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> port cities on an extended tour.; 
  But the prize, which <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> won, was who got the show on <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> <DATE>Day
1992</DATE>, the anniversary of the day <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> landed on an island in the <LOCATION>Bahamas</LOCATION>
that he named <LOCATION>San Salvador.</LOCATION>;    City officials, mesmerized by their vision of
hosting the event, have not let a few inconvenient historical facts get in the
way of a lucrative commercial opportunity.;    <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> never landed anywhere
near <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>. The telegenic caravels, supposedly a symbol of 16th
century discovery, will be flying <ORGANIZATION>Texaco Inc.</ORGANIZATION> flags, and their crew members
will be sporting <ORGANIZATION>Texaco</ORGANIZATION> emblems. And the ships won't really sail in from
anywhere; they will be carted overland from the <LOCATION>East Coast</LOCATION> by a subsidiary of
the <ORGANIZATION>Ringling Brothers</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus.;    Commission</ORGANIZATION> head;
resigned suddenly;    The person heading this massive jubilee in the <LOCATION>United
States</LOCATION> was a Republican fund-raiser and Miami-based Cuban-American businessman
who describes himself as a longtime acquaintance of President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s son, <PERSON>Jeb</PERSON>,
a <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> developer.;    <PERSON>Goudie</PERSON>, who by all accounts ran the commission like a
private empire, resigned suddenly in <DATE>December 1990</DATE>. A spate of news stories
had detailed his personal financial problems, including failing to file
federal tax returns in <DATE>1986</DATE> and <DATE>1987</DATE>, and allegations of financial
improprieties in the commission's dealings.;    A recent audit by the <ORGANIZATION>General
Accounting Office</ORGANIZATION>, an investigative arm of the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Congress</ORGANIZATION>, found no
commission money unaccounted for, but a separate criminal investigation of
<ORGANIZATION>Goudie</ORGANIZATION>'s activities continues. Goudie denied any wrongdoing in a recent
telephone interview but declined to discuss allegations in detail.;    Several
businessmen and groups say he made demands they considered unethical.;    <PERSON>Bill
Rolen</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Tennessee</LOCATION> businessman, wanted to establish a quincentenary center at
the former world's fair site in <LOCATION>Knoxville</LOCATION>. But <PERSON>Goudie</PERSON> repeatedly made
extraordinary demands, <PERSON>Rolen</PERSON> said, telling the <LOCATION>Knoxville</LOCATION> group to pay one of
<PERSON>Goudie</PERSON>'s friends <MONEY>tens of thousands of dollars</MONEY> for radio advertising in
<LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION>, ordering that a 60-foot yacht on loan to the project be tied up
behind his <LOCATION>Coral Gables</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla.</LOCATION>, home and finally demanding that two of his
friends be given control of the project.;    "We saw a red flag," said <PERSON>Rolen</PERSON>,
who has worked with world's fair projects extensively. "We were smart enough
not to get involved with him. It was just unethical to do what he was
proposing to do with us. There were too many things that were not proper.";   
Others have similar stories.;    <PERSON>Tony Baltes</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Toledo</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, businessman, and
his partners got cut out of the official quincentenary licensing group, in
which they had invested <MONEY>$500,000</MONEY>, after they started asking about thousands of
dollars in company money that went to a friend of <ORGANIZATION>Goudie's</ORGANIZATION>.;    <PERSON>Peter Dunev</PERSON>, a
<LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> businessman, lost <MONEY>$50,000</MONEY> in a quincentenary T-shirt project when he,
too, became suspicious about why his checks were being picked up by a close
friend of <ORGANIZATION>Goudie's</ORGANIZATION>. When Dunev stopped further payments, his contract with the
commission was suspended.;    In each case, these businessmen said, <PERSON>Goudie</PERSON>
ended up screaming abuses over the phone and, in two cases, threatening them
not to make complaints.;    The one big deal <PERSON>Goudie</PERSON> did line up was an
exclusive <MONEY>$5 million</MONEY> contract with <ORGANIZATION>Texaco</ORGANIZATION> that allowed the oil giant to fly
its logo over the caravels.;    After paying out <MONEY>$1.5 million</MONEY>, <ORGANIZATION>Texaco</ORGANIZATION> got into
a contract dispute with the commission and has since suspended its donations.;
   <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> bid; based on beauty;    Throughout this same period, <LOCATION>San
Francisco</LOCATION> was eagerly signing up to host the commission's <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> Day
regatta.;    City officials say <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> was selected as the host city
because Mayor <PERSON>Agnos</PERSON>' office put together a bid proposal that highlighted the
city's beauties.;    "We committed to not one cent of funding," said <PERSON>Housh</PERSON>,
<ORGANIZATION>Agnos</ORGANIZATION>' aide. "We were very smart about that.";    Or maybe <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> just
promised more than it had time to deliver.;    <PERSON>Housh</PERSON> made contradictory
statements repeatedly over the past two weeks about the city's negotiations
with <PERSON>Goudie</PERSON> and the commission, and refused to provide documents or provided
only partial documents about the quincentenary.;    But documents obtained
from the commission and interviews with <PERSON>Goudie</PERSON>, commission members, civic
leaders and officials of other cities show that a key reason for <LOCATION>San
Francisco</LOCATION>'s selection was its willingness to pay the commission up front for
the honor.;    The commission set the stage by declaring that it was receiving
only <MONEY>$220,000</MONEY> annually from <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> and was in desperate need of money. Each
city was asked how it proposed to help.;    <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, in its <DATE>April 1988</DATE>
proposal, stated its willingness to reimburse the commission "in very
substantial measure" and said the city "could well make contributions to the
commission's activities beyond reimbursement.";    <PERSON>Goudie</PERSON>, in a telephone
interview from his <LOCATION>Coral Gables</LOCATION> home, said <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>'s offer to pay was
"definitely" a factor in its selection. "Plus it's a gorgeous city," <PERSON>Goudie</PERSON>
said, laughing.;    No other city made such a generous, open-ended offer.;   
<LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> ignored that part of the questionnaire. <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> drafted a
carefully worded reply saying it would share any proceeds remaining after all
expenses had been paid and providing that the funds went to "non-revenue
generating activities" mandated by <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>. (<LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> were
the only two other contenders for the <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> Day regatta, which was to be
held on the <LOCATION>West Coast</LOCATION> because of weather restrictions.);    Not long after
<LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> was chosen in <DATE>August 1988</DATE> as the host site, the city was told to
pay the commission <MONEY>$800,000</MONEY> before <DATE>1992</DATE> as part of regatta expenses.;    Still
later, the city was told it would be assessed an additional <MONEY>$2 million</MONEY> in cash
up front, a figure that <PERSON>Goudie</PERSON> had determined, according to commission
members.;    'We would have laughed at them';    <PERSON>Goudie</PERSON> defended his requests
for money, saying the commission was badly under-funded.;    But other groups
and city officials who worked with the national commission said his demands
for cash up front were "outrageous" and "inappropriate.";    "The commission
never asked us for a dime because they knew they'd never get it from us," said
<PERSON>Howard Slotnick</PERSON>, director of Operation Sail in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, which has handled
numerous regattas and is also in charge of the caravel and tall ship parade
planned there for <DATE>July 4, 1992</DATE>. "We would have laughed at them.";    <PERSON>Slotnick</PERSON>
said he advised <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> city officials "not to pay any of it" when they
asked for his advice early on in negotiations.;    Cities typically provide
in-kind services -- police and fire services, housing for crews, port
services, accommodations for dignitaries -- but any request for cash up front
is highly unusual, say those who have handled such events.;    Spanish
officials, who have discarded their contract with the presidential commission
and are now organizing the caravel tour themselves, say they believe the money
<PERSON>Goudie</PERSON> asked for had nothing to do with the ships' tour.;    They are not
asking any cities for tour fees, said <PERSON>Miguel Ferrer</PERSON>, director of projects for
the <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> '92 Foundation, a non-profit group operating on behalf of Spain.;   
Both city officials and <PERSON>Goudie</PERSON> say no money ever went from <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> to
the commission. The executive director of the commission, however, declined to
make public a list of donations.;    Dispute continues; as time runs out;   
With <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> <DATE>Day 1992</DATE> only 17 months away, the national commission and <ORGANIZATION>Texaco</ORGANIZATION>
and <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> remain mired in dispute. The criminal investigation of <ORGANIZATION>Goudie</ORGANIZATION>'s
activities continues. And <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> '92 officials say tour plans are still
tentative, but they intend to honor the designation of <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> as host
city for the <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> Day event.;    Many of those involved in quincentennial
events locally and around the nation say they fear that the <PERSON>Goudie</PERSON>
controversy, coming on top of challenges raised by Indian groups, will keep
big corporate sponsors away.;    <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>'s joint legislative committee on
the quincentennial and its non-profit fund-raising arm have provided five
taxpayer-paid trips to <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> for a few lucky legislators. But the state, which
by <DATE>April</DATE> had not raised a cent from corporate sponsors during the committee's
three years of work, will not be much help to <LOCATION>San Francisco.</LOCATION>;    "The task
ahead will not be easy," said Rep. <PERSON>Thomas Sawyer</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-Ohio</LOCATION>, in prepared remarks
at a <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> subcommittee hearing on the presidential commission late last
month. "The commission's financial position is precarious, its image is
tarnished, and time is running out."  </TEXT>

<TEXT>     But <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> is a troubling figure. Clearly heroic, he accomplished a great
deed in the face of difficulty, and his achievement changed the world. But
though he surely did what he did, he didn't know he was doing it, and that
somewhat darkens the image. And while he did change the world, the question --
still a hot topic of debate after 500 years is whether he changed it for the
better.;   Here in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, we sometimes act as if <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> had been
Citizen No. 1. But in <LOCATION>Latin America</LOCATION>, nearly two dozen former Spanish colonies
still struggle to get over the influence of a nation that acted more like a
wicked stepmother than a mother country. Columbus is no hero there.;  
Certainly one accepted truth needs debunking. Columbus "discovered" nothing,
and to say otherwise dismisses the accomplishments, the dignity, even the
humanity of the millions of people who lived in the <LOCATION>Americas</LOCATION> long before
<LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> stepped ashore, most of whom were doomed to death within a
generation. <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>, it's worth remembering, saw American blood within hours
of landing.;   The <DATE>1992</DATE> quincentenary of <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>'s arrival gives us an
opportunity to re-evaluate both past and present and to look closely at the
Old World, the other Old World of the Americas, and at the consequences of
that momentous encounter.;   <ORGANIZATION>Publishers</ORGANIZATION>, naturally, are offering enough new
books on the subject to sink the <LOCATION>Santa Maria</LOCATION>. The best of them are highlighted
first, followed by a wide range of others.;   Worthy of presentation to
<LOCATION>Isabella</LOCATION> herself; <PERSON>Samuel Eliot Morison</PERSON>'s "Admiral of the Ocean Sea: A Life of
Christopher Columbus" (Little, <PERSON>Brown</PERSON>, <MONEY>$24.95</MONEY> paperback) won a Pulitzer Prize
when it was first published in <DATE>1941</DATE>. It shaped our image and understanding of
<LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> for decades after, and it still reads like a thriller. Every writer
on <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> in the <DATE>last half-century</DATE> has begun with <PERSON>Morison</PERSON>, and so should
every reader.;   For those of us who believe that art and ideas tell the real
truth of history, nothing matches "Circa 1492: Art in the Age of Exploration"
(<ORGANIZATION>Yale</ORGANIZATION>, <MONEY>$59.95</MONEY>), edited by <PERSON>Jay A. Levenson</PERSON>. This is the catalog of a <ORGANIZATION>National
Gallery of Art</ORGANIZATION> exhibition that opens <DATE>Oct. 12</DATE>. The book, with more than 500
color illustrations, presents art from around the world in that watershed
year. <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>Americas</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> are represented, with
authoritative commentary by a phalanx of scholars. If we were in the habit of
giving <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> Day gifts, this is what I'd want.;   <PERSON>Kenneth Nebenzahl</PERSON>'s
"Atlas of <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> and The Great Discoveries" (<PERSON>Rand McNally</PERSON>, <MONEY>$75</MONEY>) is a
cartophile's dream come true. Beginning with the world as it was known in
<LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>'s time, the author presents rare maps, many in color, that document
<LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>'s new understanding of the world. The maps themselves are beautiful and
fascinating and the text clarifies even the most obscure of them.;   "<LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>
and the Age of Discovery" (<ORGANIZATION>Morrow</ORGANIZATION>, <MONEY>$40</MONEY>) by <PERSON>Zvi Dor-Ner</PERSON> with <PERSON>William Scheller</PERSON>
is the companion volume to the seven-part PBS series. The authors sailed
<LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>'s route in replicas of his ships built by the <ORGANIZATION>Spanish Navy</ORGANIZATION>, but the
book covers more than just the adventure. In text and 300 illustrations, it
surveys all the varied aspects of the enterprise.;   "Seeds of Change"
(<ORGANIZATION>Smithsonian</ORGANIZATION>, <MONEY>$39.95</MONEY>, <MONEY>$24.95</MONEY> paperback) by <PERSON>Herman J. Viola</PERSON> and <PERSON>Carolyn
Margolis</PERSON> accompanies an exhibition opening <DATE>Oct. 26</DATE> at the <ORGANIZATION>Smithsonian</ORGANIZATION>'s
<ORGANIZATION>National Museum of Natural History</ORGANIZATION>. It documents in text and well-chosen
pictures the exchange of food, tools, diseases and everything else between
<LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Americas</LOCATION>. The transfers included corn, potatoes, tomatoes and
syphilis to <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>; horses, cattle, sugar cane and smallpox to America.;  
"Conquest of Eden 1493-1515" (<ORGANIZATION>Academy Chicago</ORGANIZATION>, <MONEY>$34.95</MONEY>) by <PERSON>Michael Paiewonsky</PERSON>
uses eyewitness accounts and rare illustrations from a private collection to
examine <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>'s later voyages in the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION>. Published in the <LOCATION>Virgin
Islands</LOCATION> and printed in <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> (in an edition of only 3,000 copies), this is a
beautifully designed and produced book. Collectors will want it for the craft
alone, and readers will like it, too.;   So many biographers, so little time; 
 The great modern biographer of <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> is Italian scholar <PERSON>Paolo Emilio
Taviani</PERSON> whose original four-volume study has been shortened and translated as
"Columbus: The Great Adventure" (<ORGANIZATION>Orion Books</ORGANIZATION>, <MONEY>$20</MONEY>). When the first half was
published in <DATE>1974</DATE>, Adm. <PERSON>Morison</PERSON> himself called it "the best and most scholarly
book I have read on <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>'s life." Taviani paints <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> in a broad
context, seeing his life as yet another expression of the Italian
Renaissance.;   "Christopher Columbus: The Voyage of Discovery 1492" (<ORGANIZATION>Dorset
Press</ORGANIZATION>, <MONEY>$12.95</MONEY>) combines, at a bargain price, excerpts from <PERSON>Morison</PERSON>'s <DATE>1974</DATE> "The
European Discovery of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>: The Southern Voyages, 1492-1616" with
contemporary portraits, maps, drawings and modern photos that bring the
subject to vivid life. "The Voyages of <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> 1492-1504" (<ORGANIZATION>Dorset Press</ORGANIZATION>,
<MONEY>$7.95</MONEY>) by <PERSON>Lorenzo Camusso</PERSON> provides a straightforward life, generously
illustrated.;   "<LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>: For Gold, God and Glory" (<ORGANIZATION>Simon &amp; Schuster</ORGANIZATION>, <MONEY>$35</MONEY>)
has text by nautical writer <PERSON>John Dyson</PERSON> and photos by <PERSON>Peter Christopher</PERSON>. They
too sailed <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>'s route in a replica of the <ORGANIZATION>Nina</ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON>Dyson</PERSON> offers a new
theory about that route, even suggesting that <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> had a secret map.;  
"Columbus" (<ORGANIZATION>Oxford</ORGANIZATION>, <MONEY>$22.95</MONEY>) by Felipe Fernandez-Armesto focuses on the
explorer's character and intellectual world but the arch tone will, depending
on the reader's patience, either annoy or amuse.;   What becomes a legend;
most? Revisionists;   <PERSON>Kirkpatrick Sale</PERSON>'s "The Conquest of Paradise:
<PERSON>Christopher Columbus</PERSON> and the Columbian Legacy" (Plume, <MONEY>$12.95</MONEY> paperback) is a
debunking biography. Much of it is superficial, but Sale does have some
interesting thoughts on the exchange of cultures.;   Better is "The Mysterious
History of <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>: An Exploration of the Man, the Myth, the Legacy" (<ORGANIZATION>Knopf</ORGANIZATION>,
<MONEY>$24</MONEY>) by <ORGANIZATION>John Noble Wilford</ORGANIZATION>. A Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, <ORGANIZATION>Wilford</ORGANIZATION>
examines all the troublesome debates in a level-headed but lively manner.;  
<PERSON>Hans Koning</PERSON> "Columbus: His Enterprise" (Monthly Review Press, <MONEY>$8.95</MONEY> paperback)
is fiercely revisionist, laying stress on the "era of genocide, cruelty and
slavery' introduced by <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>. Koning's message is unpleasant. And hard to
deny.;   In his own words;   Readers tired of other people's versions of the
truth can, of course, go right back to <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>'s own reports. A new
translation of "The Log of Christopher Columbus" by <PERSON>Robert H. Fuson</PERSON> (Tab
Books, <MONEY>$14.92</MONEY> paperback) is the one to get. It offers a fine translation, a
useful introduction, an innovative design and an historic price.;   Coming in
<DATE>December</DATE> is "The <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> Papers: The <LOCATION>Barcelona</LOCATION> Letter of 1493" (<ORGANIZATION>Macmillan</ORGANIZATION>,
<MONEY>$100</MONEY>), a bargain compared to the <MONEY>$3,000</MONEY> bibliophile edition published by the
<ORGANIZATION>New York Public Library</ORGANIZATION>, which owns the <LOCATION>Barcelona</LOCATION> Letter and the rare maps and
documents handsomely reproduced and translated in the book.;   The Old World; 
 Three new books attempt to open up for us the European world that produced
<LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> and that was about to be changed so dramatically. Cultural historian
<PERSON>Stephen Greenblatt</PERSON>, in "Marvelous Possessions: The Wonder of the New World"
(University of <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>, <MONEY>$24.95</MONEY>), examines how a highly developed sense of the
marvelous -- <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> was astonished by <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>'s news -- can lead to
understanding as well as to exploitation.;   "Fourteen Ninety Two: The Decline
of medievalism and the Rise of the Modern Age" (<ORGANIZATION>Scribner</ORGANIZATION>, 24.95) by <PERSON>Barnet
Litvinoff</PERSON> is a lively intellectual history of a world in transition. And in
"Inventing the Flat Earth: <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> and Modern Historians" (<ORGANIZATION>Praeger</ORGANIZATION>, <MONEY>$12.95</MONEY>),
<PERSON>Jeffrey Burton Russell</PERSON> explains what <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> knew and then traces the
erroneous belief that he thought the earth was flat.;   The other Old World;  
Anyone who has studied the Pre-Columbian civilizations of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> can only
lament the wholesale destruction of that world by the conquerors who followed
<LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>. "Kingdoms of Gold, Kingdoms of Jade: The Americas Before Columbus"
(Thames and Hudson, <MONEY>$24</MONEY>) by <PERSON>Brian M. Fagan</PERSON> offers the latest discoveries in an
illustrated, exciting and authoritative introduction to the world of the Inca,
<ORGANIZATION>Aztec</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Maya</LOCATION> and North American peoples.;   Food critic <PERSON>Raymond Sokolov</PERSON>, in his
wonderful book, "Why We Eat What We Eat" (Summit, <MONEY>$22</MONEY>), traces the effects of
food exchanges on the modern world. It even has some recipes.;   The <DATE>October
1991</DATE> National Geographic focuses on "1491: <LOCATION>America Before Columbus</LOCATION>," and
portrays the Native American heritage of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> on the eve of
change.; "Memory and Modernity: Popular Culture in <LOCATION>Latin America</LOCATION>" (<LOCATION>Verso</LOCATION>,
<MONEY>$59.95</MONEY>, <MONEY>$17.95</MONEY> paperback) by <PERSON>William Rowe</PERSON> and <PERSON>Vivian Schelling</PERSON> surveys the
roots of modern artistic expression in the regions most directly affected by
Spanish influence.;   The fiction of discovery; Most of the fiction inspired
-- if that's the word -- by <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> has come from <ORGANIZATION>Native American</ORGANIZATION> and Latin
American writers whose heritage keeps them ever mindful of his long-lasting
influence.;   Among the former, <PERSON>Gerald Vizenor</PERSON> is a Chippewa writer whose
latest novel, "The Heirs of <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>" (<ORGANIZATION>Wesleyan University Press</ORGANIZATION>, <MONEY>$18.95</MONEY>),
mixes fact and fiction in a tale of the explorer's mixed-blood descendants.
<PERSON>Louise Erdrich</PERSON> (also Chippewa) and <PERSON>Michael Dorris</PERSON> (of the Modoc tribe) have
collaborated on "The Crown of <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>" (HarperCollins, <MONEY>$21.95</MONEY>), a novel about
both self-discovery and the discovery of some lost <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> treasures in the
<LOCATION>Bahamas.</LOCATION>;   Three Latin American novels are especially worthy of note. The
great Cuban writer <PERSON>Alejo Carpentier</PERSON> dramatizes the debate about <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>'s
reputation in "The Harp and the Shadow" (<ORGANIZATION>Mercury House</ORGANIZATION>, <MONEY>$16.95</MONEY>). Mexican
novelist <PERSON>Carlos Fuentes</PERSON> offers a disturbing projection of the future in
"Christopher Unborn" (Penguin, <MONEY>$12.95</MONEY> paperback). And <PERSON>Homero Aridjis</PERSON>, also of
<LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>, vividly recreates 15th-century <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> in "1492: The Life and Times of
<PERSON>Juan Cabezon</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Castile</LOCATION>" (Summit, <MONEY>$21.95</MONEY>).;   Books for children; <ORGANIZATION>Publishers</ORGANIZATION>
haven't neglected young readers either.;   The most beautiful new children's
book on the subject is "Follow the Dream" (<ORGANIZATION>Knopf</ORGANIZATION>, <MONEY>$15</MONEY>) by artist <PERSON>Peter Sis</PERSON>,
but while the paintings are gorgeous, the minimal text preserves traditional
errors.;   "All Pigs on Deck" (<ORGANIZATION>Delacorte</ORGANIZATION>, <MONEY>$15</MONEY>) should amuse readers, 5 to 8.
For readers 8 to 12, "If You Were There in <DATE>1492</DATE>" (<ORGANIZATION>Bradbury Press</ORGANIZATION>, <MONEY>$13.95</MONEY>) by
<PERSON>Barbara Brenner</PERSON> provides the facts, while "I Sailed with <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>"
(HarperCollins, <MONEY>$13.95</MONEY>) by <PERSON>Miriam Schlein</PERSON> is a rousing novel of adventure.;  
Slightly older readers will like "The High Voyage" (<ORGANIZATION>Delacorte</ORGANIZATION>, <MONEY>$14.95</MONEY>) by <PERSON>Olga
Litowinsky</PERSON>, a narrative of <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>'s fourth voyage by his son, <PERSON>Fernando</PERSON>. (box)  </TEXT>

About 80 civic and community leaders gathered at the <ORGANIZATION>Harbor Club</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> 
to begin planning for the 500th anniversary celebration of <PERSON>Christopher 
Columbus</PERSON>' discovery of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The seminar, organized and hosted by the <ORGANIZATION>Orange County Christopher Columbus 
Quincentenary Commission</ORGANIZATION>, focused on recruiting businesses to participate in 
the events planned for <ORGANIZATION>Orange County</ORGANIZATION> during the yearlong commemoration. 
</P>
<P>
Among the proposed celebrations are a boat parade in <LOCATION>Newport Harbor</LOCATION>, a special 
opera night presenting at least one of the operas written about <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>' 
voyage, and a Mexican rodeo featuring trick riders from all over <LOCATION>Central 
America</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Lee Collins</PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Quincentenary Commission</ORGANIZATION>, noted that 
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION> has been especially enthusiastic about organizing for the upcoming 
celebration. So far, he said, commissions have been established in <LOCATION>San 
Francisco</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Orange County</LOCATION>, and, tentatively, in <LOCATION>Santa Barbara</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The <LOCATION>Orange County</LOCATION> commission was formed about a year ago to help organize 
events for <DATE>1992</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
One goal, according to commission co-chairman <PERSON>Frank De Santis</PERSON>, is that <LOCATION>Newport 
Beach</LOCATION> be chosen as one of the ports visited by replicas of the <ORGANIZATION>Nina</ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION>Pinta</LOCATION> 
and the <LOCATION>Santa Maria</LOCATION>, which will be duplicating <ORGANIZATION>Columbus</ORGANIZATION>' voyage across the 
<LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION>.LAURA <LOCATION>MICHAELIS</LOCATION>

<LEADPARA>  WOULD the world have been a different place if an Indian in a sailing ship
landed in Europe before Christopher Columbus hit the Bahamas? You bet.;  
Maybe the Indians would have colonized Spain instead of vice versa. Maybe
Columbus, Ohio, would have a different name. And maybe we'd all be eating
buffalo meat.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     But even those who would rewrite history can't change it, and it was
<LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> who came west instead of the Indians going east. And that voyage did
set off a chain-reaction of epic events, both good and evil, which affect the
entire globe to this day.;   With the 500th anniversary of <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>' first
voyage just a year away, the debate over its meaning is about to become a
cottage industry.;   And no cottage industry is complete without a TV show: in
this case <ORGANIZATION>PBS</ORGANIZATION>'s seven-hour "<LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> and the Age of Discovery," public TV's
attempt to do for the discovery of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> what it did last year for the Civil
War.;   But alas, <PERSON>Zvi Dor-Ner</PERSON>, the film maker who spent 10 years putting
"<LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>" together, is no <PERSON>Ken Burns</PERSON>, the man behind the magnificent "Civil
War." In <PERSON>Burns</PERSON>' hands these seven hours wouldn't seem so much like 12 or 14.; 
 What "<LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>" offers are two or three interesting hours about "history's
most stunning accident" -- stretched to seven mostly dull ones. Beautiful, but
dull.;   By the time the series really hits its stride in hour six, I'm afraid
no one will be watching.;   Most people will have a hard time staying with
<DATE>Sunday</DATE>'s opening two hours, which meander around the globe, setting up
<LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>' times, his motivation and his struggle to get someone to finance his
dream of sailing west to reach the <LOCATION>East</LOCATION>. Surely this could have been done in
one hour instead of two.;   Even the prologue is prolonged, as narrator <PERSON>Will
Lyman</PERSON> ("<LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>: A Television History") asks, "Should we celebrate <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>'
great achievement, or should we mourn a world forever lost?";   The answer, of
course, is both. No matter what horrors followed -- and the decimation of the
native population of Hispaniola from half a million to 500 in little more than
25 years, six of them while <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> himself was governor, certainly is a
horror -- the voyage itself was an astounding achievement of navigation and
courage. We see that chronicled in Part 3, "The Crossing.";   It's what
<LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> and others did after they landed that's so debatable, substituting
one culture for another and rarely gently.;   The debate is dealt with in
"<LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>" -- and not just by experts but by real people in the lands
affected. Like everything else here, though, the show takes a long time to get
there.;   If you hang in, however, you will learn something: that <PERSON>Martin
Pinzon</PERSON> is seen as the real hero of the first voyage by many Spaniards; or how
the exchange of crops and animals between the New and Old Worlds put horses on
the American plains, brought potatoes to <LOCATION>Ireland</LOCATION>, corn to <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> and sugar
cane to the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION>, for example.;   With cane, sadly, came slaves, a far
less noble part of the trade, explored in the series' most successful hour,
the sixth one, called "The <ORGANIZATION>Columbian Exchange</ORGANIZATION>.";   The conclusion, "In Search
of <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>," lays out the astounding paradox of the man: "<PERSON>Christopher
Columbus</PERSON>, an Italian seaman sailing for the Catholic monarchies of <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>, has
been embraced as a national hero by the mainly English-speaking, <ORGANIZATION>Protestant
United States of America</ORGANIZATION> in a land he never set foot in, that he refused to
believe existed and that was named for someone else.";   Had the rest of this
series been as succinct, it would have been a glorious triumph instead of such
a tedious trip.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  UP ABOVE the door, a wide-screen television is bringing the afternoon
bullfights from Madrid. Big-time razzle-dazzle has made it to la corrida.
Instant replays of the moment of death. Live interviews with the toreros
moments after the triumphant kill. Critical commentary. Death in the afternoon
as designed by Wide World of Sports. Hemingway would not have approved.
Hemingway would have made obnoxious noises. Hemingway is long gone.;    The
dozens of men in the bar -- only a couple of women -- are watching the tube
now and then, drinking tiny cups of strong Spanish coffee, reading newspapers,
talking politics and taxes, doing those things men do in Spanish bars on rainy

The Great Columbus Chase
Last in a four-part series  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     The <ORGANIZATION>Cafe El Norte</ORGANIZATION>, facing the Plaza Mayor in the heart of this fairly plain
city on the plains of northern <LOCATION>Andalusia</LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION>Cafe El Norte</ORGANIZATION>, busy bar and
social center. The <ORGANIZATION>Cafe El Norte</ORGANIZATION>, last resting place for the Admiral of the
<LOCATION>Open Ocean</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Don Cristobal Colon</PERSON>, the dude who discovered America.;    Or is
it?;    Historians are in general agreement about the final fate of
<PERSON>Christopher Columbus</PERSON>. He made four voyages to the <LOCATION>New World</LOCATION>, starting in <DATE>1492</DATE>
-- voyages that eventually destroyed his health and soured his soul. His last
years were spent haggling with the king of <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> about the profits he had
coming from the discovery of the <LOCATION>Western Hemisphere.</LOCATION>;    When he was given
backing by <PERSON>Ferdinand</PERSON> and Isabella in <DATE>1492</DATE>, he extracted an agreement that
included some major concessions by the crown, including a <PERCENT>10 percent</PERCENT> share of
all profits from the new lands, as well as honorary titles.;    The crown
chose to redefine the agreement toward the end of <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>' life, taking away
most of his claims. (Despite this, he was quite rich.) He was allowed to keep
his titles -- as were his heirs. Today, there is a Cristobal Colon in <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>, a
young man who still has the right to be called the Admiral of the Open Sea,
the title  <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> insisted he be given before he took off for the edge of
the world.;    <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> moved to <LOCATION>Valladolid</LOCATION> in <DATE>1506</DATE> and died there <DATE>May 20</DATE>.
That much is sure. What happened after that is the subject of some debate
among scholars.;    One version has him being buried in <LOCATION>Valladolid</LOCATION>, then being
moved to a monastery in <LOCATION>Seville</LOCATION> sometime between <DATE>1509</DATE> and <DATE>1514</DATE>. In <DATE>1537</DATE>, he
was moved to <ORGANIZATION>Santo Domingo</ORGANIZATION> (the Bahamian island where he supposedly landed in
<DATE>1492</DATE>). In <DATE>1795</DATE>, his remains were moved to <LOCATION>Havana</LOCATION>, where they stayed until the
end of the Spanish-American War. They were then sent back to <LOCATION>Seville</LOCATION> and
buried in the great cathedral there.;     Italian biographer <PERSON>Gianni Granzotto</PERSON>
has the most intriguing the story -- and this is where the <ORGANIZATION>Cafe El Norte</ORGANIZATION> comes
on the scene.;    <PERSON>Granzotto</PERSON> says that on the Plaza Mayor -- right where the
<ORGANIZATION>Cafe El Norte</ORGANIZATION> sits <DATE>today</DATE> -- there was a Franciscan monastery at the time of
<LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>' death. The monastery, <PERSON>St. Francis</PERSON>, contained a burial crypt.;    The
crypt now lies beneath the floor of the <ORGANIZATION>Cafe El Norte</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Granzotto</PERSON> says it
contains the bones of <PERSON>Christopher Columbus</PERSON>, devout Franciscan.;    So it was
no surprise that after the usual tourist inquiry was made -- i.e., where's the
body? -- the owner of the <ORGANIZATION>Cafe El Norte</ORGANIZATION> himself arrived at the table and
allowed there was a chance <PERSON>Don Cristobal Colon</PERSON> was moldering beneath his
feet.;    "Many Americans, many English, they come in here and ask to see his
grave. We do not know that it really is there because that was long ago. But
perhaps, why not? It is an interesting little story, is it not?";    And so
you won't be totally disappointed that no tours of the <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> bones are
available (or at least offered), he hands out free <ORGANIZATION>Cafe El Norte</ORGANIZATION> calendars as
souvenirs and walks away to discuss the bullfight.;    So, who cares?; 
Goodbye, <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>, write if you find work -- or the <LOCATION>New World</LOCATION>, whatever -- and
don't call us, we'll call you. Valladolid, unlike most of the other European
haunts of the great explorer, seems mostly indifferent to its connection with
Spanish history.;    Yeah, there's a statue of <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>, but this is no big
deal -- in <LOCATION>Andalusia</LOCATION> and most other parts of <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>, any town with more than 10
people is likely to have at least one bronze rendering of our Italian hero.;  
 The house in <LOCATION>Valladolid</LOCATION> where he died apparently is gone, but there is a
small museum nearby that once was owned by the <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> family and serves as a
symbolic tie to the past. (In some tourism literature, the museum is, in fact,
described as the house where he died.);    But nowhere in the city are there
signs directing the curious to the museum, and it's clear from the patrons of
the <ORGANIZATION>Cafe El Norte</ORGANIZATION> that the exact spot where the Great Explorer dropped his
last anchor is of little importance -- especially on the afternoon of the
<LOCATION>Madrid</LOCATION> bullfights.;    The museum is closed this year in anticipation of the
500th anniversary of his first voyage next year, and there are some historical
displays going up around the Plaza Mayor.;    In official city maps, which
have illustrated notes about many historical buildings around the city, there
is some mention of the statue honoring "the illustrious Almirante del Mar
Oceano -- Admiral of the Open Ocean," but the location of the museum and house
are given only a single line -- and many locals, when asked, seem not to know
where the house is.;    <LOCATION>Seville</LOCATION>'s claim;  Most of the <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> madness around
the vast province of <LOCATION>Andalusia</LOCATION> is centered in <LOCATION>Seville</LOCATION>, site of the <DATE>1992</DATE>
world's fair. The folks in <LOCATION>Seville</LOCATION> have no doubt about the bones -- they are
now, always have been, always will be stashed in the cathedral of <LOCATION>Seville</LOCATION>.
Valladolid? The <ORGANIZATION>Cafe El Norte</ORGANIZATION>? Nothing but the ramblings of an uninformed
historian -- an Italian one at that.;    <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> used <LOCATION>Seville</LOCATION> as a base for
several of his later trips to the <LOCATION>New World</LOCATION>, and it also was from here that
the other Italian explorer -- <PERSON>Amerigo Vespucci</PERSON>, the one with the good press
agent -- sailed. (Two continents were named after <PERSON>Vespucci</PERSON>; <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> got one
American country, one Canadian province and a nice town in <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>.);    The <DATE>1992</DATE>
<ORGANIZATION>Seville Expo</ORGANIZATION> is one of two big deals going on in <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> next year, the other
being the <DATE>summer</DATE> Olympic Games in <LOCATION>Barcelona</LOCATION>. And, like <LOCATION>Barcelona</LOCATION>, big chunks
of <LOCATION>Seville</LOCATION> are torn up in preparation.;    <LOCATION>The Expo</LOCATION>, like the Olympics, is
tied into the 500th anniversary of the first <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> voyage in <DATE>1492</DATE>. The Expo
theme is "The Age of Discovery," and the <ORGANIZATION>Columbus-Seville</ORGANIZATION> connection is being
pushed hard.;    Dem bones, dem bones;  Millions of people are expected to
wander through <LOCATION>Seville</LOCATION> next <DATE>summer</DATE> to check out the fair and soak up some
<ORGANIZATION>Columbiana</ORGANIZATION>. But the guest of honor won't be around. Seville can make all the
rash claims it wants, and hold all the parties it can, and hire herds of
public relations types to hype the 500th anniversary of the great admiral's
exploits. But everyone knows old <PERSON>Chris</PERSON> is stuck in <LOCATION>Valladolid</LOCATION>, under the floor
of the <ORGANIZATION>Cafe El Norte.</ORGANIZATION>;    We'll leave him there, 500 years and half a
continent away from where he started back in <LOCATION>Genoa</LOCATION>. One thing about <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>
-- you might not admire him much, but you have to admit he got around. And
following in his footsteps around <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> won't make you any better historian,
but it surely will lead you to some great food, nice folks and pretty
scenery.;    It almost makes you want to hop on a leaky old boat and sail off
to the edge of the world.;    Almost.  </TEXT>

   As he stands before groups of schoolchildren in his
tights, doublet and cape, Joseph Laufer may not be the
spitting image of Christopher Columbus. But he has the look.
The 56-year-old amateur historian and "events person" also
has some of the explorer's pluck. He certainly has thrown
himself into commemorating whatever it was that Columbus, an
Italian, did for Spain in 1492. It has become one of the
touchiest events in American history.
   Some of the splashier official celebrations planned for
next year's 500th anniversary of Columbus's epic voyage have
run aground. The Christopher Columbus Quincentenary Jubilee
Commission, created by Congress in 1984 to coordinate events
large and small, is broke. Its chairman, John Goudie,
resigned recently amid charges of mismanagement that are
currently under investigation by a House subcommittee. With
the anniversary less than 18 months away, the commission is
scrambling to get back on track.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Money troubles have caused some of the states to scale
back but not cancel their own quincentenary plans. "It's
really going to be a pretty sad state of affairs compared to
what it should be," says <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> state senator <PERSON>Curt Kiser</PERSON> of
his state's commemoration, which has fallen victim to a
budget crunch.
   Nor have corporate sponsors taken up the slack. Columbus
is a tough sell in board rooms when companies are laying off
workers, <PERSON>Mr. Kiser</PERSON> says.
   It doesn't help that the explorer has become a lightning
rod for ethnic sensitivities. Native Americans, Hispanics and
Italians have been squabbling over the revisionist view of
<LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> as a conquistador and despoiler who can hardly be
said to have discovered <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>. Accordingly, a delicate new
terminology has been crafted for all quincentenary discourse:
The "discovery" of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>, for example, is now known as the
"encounter" of two cultures.
   With officialdom in disarray, it has fallen to certain
stalwarts to carry the torch for <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>. One is <PERSON>Daniel
Amato</PERSON>, a member of the Knights of <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> and a collector of
memorabilia from the 1893 <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> world's fair that marked
<LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>'s 400th anniversary -- a year late. <PERSON>Mr. Amato</PERSON> has
erected a Fiberglas statue of the explorer near his mall of
antique shops in <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wis.</LOCATION> "Who's going to come to
<LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>, unless you promote Columbus?" he says.
   Then there is <PERSON>Anne Paolucci</PERSON>, a playwright and academic
whose <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> organization, <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>: Countdown <DATE>1992</DATE>, has
commissioned literary and artistic works related to the
<LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> epic. "Our artists are doing marvelous things, yet
the flak is getting all the publicity," she says.
   <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, is staging the only major exposition in
the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> <PERSON>Marjory Pizzuti</PERSON>, who is directing the city's
year-long tribute to its namesake, says she hopes to draw
tourists and make the city "more top-of-the-mind." Given what
she calls the "ambiguity" of the events of <DATE>1492</DATE>, she also
sees it as a chance "to explore the good, the bad and the
ugly of what happened." Among the scheduled attractions
starting this <DATE>October</DATE>: a flower festival, a replica of the
flagship <LOCATION>Santa Maria</LOCATION>, body-building contests and -- to honor
the Italians' development of double-entry bookkeeping -- an
exhibit of "500 Years of Accounting."
   But few have displayed the zeal of <PERSON>Joseph Laufer</PERSON>. For the
past six years -- which is nearly as long as it took <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>
to wheedle the money for his voyage from Queen Isabella --
<PERSON>Mr. Laufer</PERSON> has been engrossed in the quincentenary: issuing a
newsletter for fellow enthusiasts around the world, creating
a museum of Columbiana behind his Vincentown, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>, house and
carrying his myth-busting version of the explorer's story to
gatherings of school-children.
   As he criss-crosses the country, he is amazed that
<LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> isn't more important to people than he is. "That's
where the commission totally let us down," he says. The
commission "didn't learn anything from <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>. He was a
risk-taker. But, now, nobody wants to offend anybody, so as a
result we get nowhere."
   The commission, regrouping under new management, insists
it can turn things around and that hundreds of local events
will take place next year. Several newly announced national
projects seek private financing. <PERSON>Jim Kuhn</PERSON>, the new executive
director, says: "We're very positive about the direction
we're taking now."
   <PERSON>Mr. Laufer</PERSON> isn't holding his breath. After years of
pursuing his passion at his own expense (he is on leave from
a job as a community college administrator and <MONEY>$50,000</MONEY> in
debt) he recently found a patron. "My Isabella," is his term
for <ORGANIZATION>New American Crossings, Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Laguna Niguel</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>,
company that promotes quincentenary projects. It is
underwriting <PERSON>Mr. Laufer</PERSON>'s speaking tour as a way of
displaying a mural reproduction of <ORGANIZATION>Emanuel Leutze</ORGANIZATION>'s <DATE>1855</DATE>
painting of <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>'s departure from <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>. The original,
owned by investors, is on loan to the <ORGANIZATION>Smithsonian</ORGANIZATION>
Institution. <PERSON>Mr. Laufer</PERSON> lugs the collapsible, 8-by-10-foot
copy with him wherever he goes.
   A recent stop on his mural tour was in <LOCATION>Boalsburg</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pa.</LOCATION>, the
site of a strong tangible link to <PERSON>Christopher Columbus</PERSON> in the
<LOCATION>New World</LOCATION>. Columbus never set foot in sleepy <LOCATION>Boalsburg</LOCATION>, but
the contents of his family's chapel in northern <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> found
their way here in <DATE>1919</DATE>. Col. <PERSON>Theodore Davis Boal</PERSON> had married
into the <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> family while visiting <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, and his wife,
<PERSON>Mathilde</PERSON>, inherited the chapel. The <LOCATION>Boalsburg</LOCATION> museum has been
designated a <ORGANIZATION>National Historic Site</ORGANIZATION>.
   Heirlooms include an admiral's desk, an explorer's cross
of the sort used to claim new territory, and two purported
fragments of the <ORGANIZATION>True Cross</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>Mr. Laufer</PERSON> was invited to kick
off a year and a half of quincentenary events in <LOCATION>Boalsburg</LOCATION>.
   The chapel is but one stop on <PERSON>Mr. Laufer</PERSON>'s three-day swing
through <LOCATION>Boalsburg</LOCATION>. Dressed in his <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> costume, fashioned
by the seamstress who makes his daughter's prom gowns, he
enthralls several hundred local schoolchildren with his
warts-and-all rendition of the explorer's life.
   <PERSON>Mr. Laufer</PERSON> faces up to the decimation of the Taino
population of the <LOCATION>West Indies</LOCATION> following <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>'s arrival
there, and to the environmental damage European settlement
brought. He talks about <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> as a single parent who had
to leave his son, <LOCATION>Diego</LOCATION>, with Franciscan priests during his
voyages. As for <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>'s all-male crew, he explains: "They
didn't know about equal rights back then."
   <PERSON>Mr. Laufer</PERSON> is a middle-of-the-roader about <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>; his
mission is more to educate than celebrate. Still, he has
little sympathy for the Columbus-bashers who would belittle
the explorer's achievements. "You can't lay everything at the
footsteps of <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> or the Spanish," he says.
   Like others associated with the quincentenary, he has
learned to watch his language. He avoids the word
"discovery," with its Eurocentric bias. "Celebration" and
"melting pot" are other taboos.
   However, he says he drew the line when the <ORGANIZATION>National Park
Service</ORGANIZATION> tried to edit a passage in the children's activity
manual he wrote for the agency. In it, he had <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>
bestowing the name "Indians" on the natives of what he
thought were the Indies. The <ORGANIZATION>Park Service</ORGANIZATION> wanted to have
<LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> name them "Native Americans."

Expo <DATE>'92</DATE>, the major world's fair planned for <LOCATION>Seville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>, will celebrate the 
500th anniversary of <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>' discovery of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> -- and it looks like the 
<LOCATION>United States of America</LOCATION> will not be represented. 
</P>
<P>
Money for the <MONEY>$30-million</MONEY> <LOCATION>Seville U.S.</LOCATION> pavilion, designed by a <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> team 
led by architects <ORGANIZATION>Barton Myers Associates</ORGANIZATION>, has been cut from the federal 
budget. The bill that created funding for the pavilion was eliminated from the 
<DATE>1990</DATE> federal appropriations measure recently passed by both houses of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> 
and signed into law by President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
The pavilion's funding is a victim of the struggle to balance the federal 
budget. Rep. <PERSON>Neil Smith</PERSON> (D-Iowa), chairman of a <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> subcommittee that 
oversees the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Information Agency</ORGANIZATION>, declared that <LOCATION>Seville</LOCATION> "is a low priority 
for taxpayers' money at a time when lawmakers are trying to reduce the 
deficit." 
</P>
<P>
Architect <PERSON>Barton Myers</PERSON> said he is "frankly appalled" at the government's 
failure to fund the project. <PERSON>Myers</PERSON>' design, which won a national architectural 
competition and has been widely praised by critics across the country, has now 
missed the ground-breaking deadline set for this <DATE>spring</DATE> on the Expo '92 site, 
an island in the <LOCATION>Guadalquivir River</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"I deeply regret that the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, alone among the world's major nations, may well 
fail to be represented at <LOCATION>Seville</LOCATION>, in a fair that highlights the Age of 
Discovery," <PERSON>Myers</PERSON> said. "This is despite the fact that President <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> wrote 
personally to <PERSON>King Juan Carlos</PERSON> promising that the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> would most certainly be 
present in <DATE>1992</DATE>." 
</P>
<P>
About 110 countries have committed to build pavilions at the fair site. Among 
the nations that will not be represented are <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Albania</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Syria</LOCATION> 
and <LOCATION>North Korea</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Myers</PERSON>' design for the <LOCATION>Seville U.S.</LOCATION> pavilion imaginatively develops the fair's 
theme of discovery. Passing through an entry under a wall of water, visitors 
cross a bridge over an "ocean," which symbolizes <ORGANIZATION>Columbus</ORGANIZATION>' voyages to the New 
World. Inside the pavilion three high-tech, sun-tracking "shade sails" invoke 
images of <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>' vessels: the <ORGANIZATION>Nina</ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION>Pinta</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Santa Maria</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Fifty pylons, representing the states, double as cooling towers that draw hot, 
dry air through a layer of moistened pads. This energy-saving device avoids the 
need for air conditioning in the Andalusian <DATE>summer</DATE> and demonstrates American 
ingenuity. 
</P>
<P>
If the pavilion is to be built after all, it will either require a special 
federal appropriation or its backers will have to seek private-sector funding, 
<PERSON>Myers</PERSON> said. Even if the private sector can be persuaded to fund the pavilion, 
whose construction would have to be rushed, <PERSON>Myers</PERSON> questioned whether the <LOCATION>United 
States</LOCATION> should be represented at this major international fair by private 
interests rather than a government agency. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>USIA</ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> declined to comment on the pavilion situation. 
Agency spokesman <PERSON>Frank Johnson</PERSON> said it is "hopeful" that funding will be found 
in time for a fall start on construction. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Peter L. Spurney</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> fair-management specialist involved with Expo 
<DATE>'92</DATE>, said, "<LOCATION>Seville</LOCATION> will reflect what's going on in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> in <DATE>1992</DATE>. Like it or 
not, it's going to be the place to be." 
</P>
<P>
But not, it seems, for the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>. As <PERSON>Heller</PERSON> remarked, "the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> effort 
in <LOCATION>Seville</LOCATION> is so far dead in the water."

<LEADPARA>  CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS, and the 90 men who sailed the three ships under his
command, set out on their famous voyage 499 years ago this weekend, Aug. 3,
1492.;    We know many things about Columbus and his "discovery" of the New
World. We know, for example, that he had red hair, blue eyes and was at least
6 feet tall (almost a giant by the standards of his day). We don't know much
more about his appearance because not a single portrait was ever painted of
him during his life.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     We also know that <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> was far from alone in believing the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> was
round. It was pretty well taken for granted during his time, although <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>
thought the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> was much smaller than the size estimated by most scholars of
the day, and on this point he was dead wrong.;    <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> believed in the
"big <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION>, small <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION>" theory, and argued that <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> lay just
2,000 miles or so west of <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>. Actually, a westward voyage to <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> would
have been at least 10,000 miles long, and had not <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> accidentally bumped
into the New World, he and his crew would surely have died of thirst and never
merited so much as a footnote in our history books.;    WHAT many of our
children don't know about <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>, though, is just why he set out on this
perilous voyage in the first place. And it is just this type of inquiry that
can help all of us imbue our children with a "sense" of history, by which I
mean a feeling for the flesh-and-blood human beings that seem so lifeless or
so immortal when they are portrayed in our children's history texts.;    It
takes great imagination to picture oneself as living during the times of
various historic events, but this is just what children must do if they are
ever to see history as being more than a boring collection of facts and dates,
and if they are ever to use the lessons of history to guide their own lives.; 
  Children take refrigerated food and frozen dinners for granted, but can they
imagine what meals must have been like in <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>' time, when salt was the
only known preservative and when most foods -- especially meats -- arrived at
the table already spoiled and tasting of decay?;    Perhaps they can
understand then why spices -- especially pepper -- were, quite literally,
worth their weight in gold. Pepper and nutmeg and cloves could mask the awful
taste and smell of spoiled food, but these spices were found only in the <LOCATION>Spice
Islands</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Orient</LOCATION>, and so Europeans had to pay dearly for them to be
transported across Asia.;     <LOCATION>COLUMBUS</LOCATION> convinced the king and queen of <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>
that he could reach these spice-bearing lands from the other direction, and
throughout his life he maintained that he had done just that, refusing to
believe that he had discovered anything new.;    To help your children get
better acquainted with their own senses of smell and taste, make sure they
know that these two senses are related: It is very difficult to taste anything
that you cannot smell. Put a clip on your child's nose and then put a few
grains of fresh ground coffee in his mouth. Can he taste what he is chewing?
Then have him remove the clip and feel the instantaneous rush of flavor that
accompanies the return of his sense of smell.  </TEXT>

   How's this for revisionist history? The
pilgrims sailed to <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> in the <LOCATION>Pinto</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Paul Revere</PERSON> wrote ``The
Star-Spangled Banner.'' <PERSON>Sandra Day O'Connor</PERSON> is chief justice of the
<ORGANIZATION>U.S. Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION>.
   And Gen. <PERSON>Douglas MacArthur</PERSON> said, ``Give me liberty or give me
death.'' Or was it <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King Jr.</ORGANIZATION>?
   These are samplings of responses from community-college students
to questions that might be asked of immigrants seeking <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
citizenship.
   Just five of 119 students at <ORGANIZATION>Bellevue Community College</ORGANIZATION> managed
a passing grade of <PERCENT>70 percent</PERCENT> or better.
   ``This is pretty bad,'' said <PERSON>Aslam Khan</PERSON>, head of the college's
political science department, who administered the test.
   ``Why should we give these questions to foreigners when our own
citizens don't know what is going on?'' asked the <PERSON>Pakistan-born
Khan</PERSON>, who took such a test when he became a naturalized citizen.
   Less than half the students knew that the supreme law of the
land is the Constitution.
   When asked what kind of government the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> has, many
answered ``capitalist,'' rather than a democracy.
   Some said the pilgrims left <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> because they were searching
for something to colonize, apparently forgetting the religious
persecution that prompted them to flee to the <LOCATION>New World</LOCATION>.
   A decade ago, Khan gave a similar test of 10 questions to 118
students. Six passed.
   ``It's not getting any better,'' he said.
   It may be good for a few snickers when a student identifies
<PERSON>Abraham Lincoln</PERSON> as the principal author of the Declaration of
Independence, but when only one student answers 29 of the 30
questions correctly and just 18 get <PERCENT>60 percent</PERCENT> right, everybody
should be concerned, <PERSON>Khan</PERSON> said.
   ``I think people should know what is going on in this country,''
he said. ``We really do need a course in remedial <ORGANIZATION>American
Government</ORGANIZATION>.''
   For the record:
   _ The Pinta, not the <PERSON>Pinto</PERSON>, was one of three ships used by
<PERSON>Christopher Columbus</PERSON>, along with the <PERSON>Nina</PERSON> and the <LOCATION>Santa Maria</LOCATION>. The
pilgrims sailed in the <ORGANIZATION>Mayflower</ORGANIZATION>.
   _ <PERSON>Francis Scott Key</PERSON> wrote the national anthem, while <PERSON>Paul Revere</PERSON>
warned American revolutionaries the British were coming.
   _ <PERSON>Ms. O'Connor</PERSON> is the first woman to serve on the <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION>,
which has yet to have a woman chief justice.
   _ <PERSON>Patrick Henry</PERSON> preferred death over tyranny in his famous to

pledging ``I shall return'' to the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION> and civil-rights

FT  27 FEB 92 / Survey of Dominican Republic (9): Columbus fever runs high -
Canute James looks forward to the celebrations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON A low hill overlooking the harbour in <LOCATION>Santo Domingo</LOCATION>, capital of the
<LOCATION>Dominican Republic</LOCATION>, teams of workmen are scrambling over a massive concrete
structure that was designed 43 years ago. The government hopes it will be
completed this year.
The <ORGANIZATION>Columbus Lighthouse</ORGANIZATION>, a monument whose completion is costing <MONEY>millions of
dollars</MONEY>, is central to much that is happen- ing in the country this year.
The lighthouse is the most ambitious part of the country's commemoration -
celebration, says the official literature - of the arrival of <PERSON>Christopher
Columbus</PERSON> in the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> 500 years ago.
Columbus fever is running high in the country. One weekend earlier this
month, thousands of Dominicans flocked to the port in <LOCATION>Santo Domingo</LOCATION> to view
the replicas of the <LOCATION>Pinta</LOCATION>, the <PERSON>Nina</PERSON> and the <LOCATION>Santa Maria</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>'s famed
boats, which were on a short visit.
'This will be a good year for this country,' says the head of a local
business group. 'We are celebrating a milestone.'
Preparations for the event are evident all over <LOCATION>Santo Domingo</LOCATION>. Roads and
bridges are being improved, the colonial section of the city is being
rebuilt and efforts are under way to improve the electricity supply. The
administrators of the country's tourist industry expect an increase in the
volume of visitors, drawn by the focus on <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>.
Cynics and the political cognoscenti concur that 500 years after he arrived,
<LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> still has a profound effect on contemporary Dominican politics.
They say <PERSON>Mr Joaquin Balaguer</PERSON>, the president, was determined to stand again
for office in the <DATE>1990</DATE> elections simply to be in charge of this year's
events.
According to the <ORGANIZATION>Dominican Commission</ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION>Celeb</ORGANIZATION>- ration of the
Quincentenary, <LOCATION>La Isabela</LOCATION>, established on Hispaniola by <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> on his
second voyage, was the 'first seat of western civilisation in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>,' and
produced 'the miracle that today we call <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>.'
It was the <LOCATION>Dominican Republic</LOCATION>, according to the commission, which was the
centre of the transfer of 'the values of western civilisation to <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'.
The country, it says, was the site of the first mass celebrated in the
<LOCATION>Americas</LOCATION>, the first munic- ipality, the first city, the first viceregal
court, the first university and the first cathedral in which, incid-
entally, <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> is buried until his remains are moved to the lighthouse
which is being built.
Dominicans appear oblivious to the consternation which they have created in
other parts of the region, not by their claim on <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>, but because of
the language which they use. There is little tolerance of suggestions that
the use of the word 'discovery' is eschewed by most of their neighbours who
prefer to 'commemorate' the event as an 'encounter' of <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> with the
Americas.
'Of course there were people here when <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> got here,' agrees the
business leader. 'But if he did not discover them no one would have known
they were here. He brought them Christianity and civilisation. I must be
thankful. I would not be here if it had not been for <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>.'

<LEADPARA>  THE 1992 Expo will be a major test for Seville, the capital of Andalusia and a
city infamous for its street crimes against tourists. It will be interesting
to see if the city can put a lid on the thousands of pickpockets, petty
thieves and moped-driving armed robbers that make being a tourist here so
exciting -- and also to see if anybody dies from the oven-hot weather that
hits around these parts in the summer.;    The Expo will be on a big island in
the middle of the Quadalquivar River, which runs through Seville. The river
once was a major artery for Americas-bound explorers.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     During <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>'s age of discovery -- and before the <LOCATION>Quadalquivar River</LOCATION> silted
up -- <LOCATION>Seville</LOCATION> was the headquarters for European trade with the New World, by
decree of <LOCATION>Ferdinand</LOCATION> and Isabella.;    <LOCATION>Seville</LOCATION> has other claims to fame. It's
the flamenco capital of the world. The cigar factory where <PERSON>Bizet</PERSON>'s <PERSON>Carmen</PERSON> did
her thing is here, and it's also the setting for two other famous operas --
"The Marriage of Figaro" and "The Barber of <LOCATION>Seville</LOCATION>." <LOCATION>Seville</LOCATION> is building an
opera house for these and other offerings. The new <ORGANIZATION>Teatro de la Maestranza</ORGANIZATION> is
supposed to be ready by <DATE>May</DATE>, with Spanish tenor <ORGANIZATION>Placido Domingo</ORGANIZATION> as operatic
director.;    And one of the most important collections of historical
documents in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> is found here, the <ORGANIZATION>Indies Archives</ORGANIZATION>, housed in a building
near the cathedral. The collection -- with nearly 50,000 files -- includes
maps, charts and letters from <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Cortes</PERSON> and other great
Spanish explorers. One of the goals of the Spanish government this year and
next is to computerize the files.;    Tourists planning to stop in on the
world's fair will find rooms hard to come by. <PERSON>Emilio Casinello</PERSON>, who's in
charge of the Expo, says some visitors might have to stay two or three hours
outside of town, but there will be rooms for everyone.;    The fair runs from
<DATE>April 20</DATE> to <DATE>Oct. 12</DATE>, and more than 100 countries are expected to participate.
The <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Congress</ORGANIZATION> has appropriated <MONEY>$13 million</MONEY> for the <LOCATION>Seville</LOCATION> fair and
another <MONEY>$1.5 million</MONEY> for another <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> celebration to be held next <DATE>summer</DATE>
in <LOCATION>Genoa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Italy.</LOCATION>;    Monastery restored;  The Expo site -- La Cartuja island
in the <LOCATION>Quadalquivar River</LOCATION> -- covers about 530 acres. The 15th-century
monastery of <LOCATION>Santa Maria</LOCATION> de las Cuevas, once the only building on island, is
being restored, and its outer lodge will become a royal pavilion where <PERSON>King
Juan Carlos</PERSON> will receive visiting dignitaries. Columbus supposedly lived at
the monastery for eight years.;    The biggest foreign pavilions will be those
of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>United Kingdom</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>. <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> hopes the
Expo will attract about 20 million visitors during its six-month run, half of
those foreigners. <LOCATION>Seville</LOCATION>, the same size as <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION>, is the smallest city
ever to host a world's fair.;    Like <LOCATION>Barcelona</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Seville</LOCATION> is a city under siege
by construction workers. Spanish government investment now totals about <MONEY>$1.5
billion</MONEY> on the actual Expo site, with <MONEY>$7 billion</MONEY> more being spent on roads,
rail and other infrastructure.;    Twenty new hotels are under way, and by
next <DATE>spring</DATE>, officials are forecasting a total of 75,000 beds (current hotel
capacity in <LOCATION>Seville</LOCATION> is about 10,000). Another 100,000 beds will be offered in
homes and apartments within an hour and a half of the city, and 600,000 more
beds are two and a half hours away on the <LOCATION>Costa</LOCATION> del Sol.;    Officials in
<LOCATION>Seville</LOCATION> say they plan to ask local citizens to rent out their extra bedrooms
as part of a bed-and-breakfast program. Information about such programs should
be available from the <ORGANIZATION>Spanish National Tourist Office</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Beverly Hills</LOCATION>, but
calls there often result in "we don't know" responses.;    New rail service; 
Also by next <DATE>April</DATE>, <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> hopes to begin high-speed rail service between
<LOCATION>Madrid</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Seville</LOCATION> using trains that will cut the journey from six hours to
two hours and 45 minutes. The service, to be known as AVE, after its Spanish
name, <ORGANIZATION>Tren de Alta Velocidad Espa</ORGANIZATION> ola, will travel at up to 186 miles an hour.
There will be an <ORGANIZATION>AVE</ORGANIZATION> terminal at the Expo site.;    The high-speed trains will
have air-conditioned cars and a cafe car with telephones and a boutique.
Between 10 and 14 daily departures in each direction are planned, but
schedules and fares have yet to be announced. And work is proceeding on a new
airport terminal that is hoped to triple passenger capacity.;    Also next
year, an antique train, the <ORGANIZATION>Andalusian Express</ORGANIZATION>, will begin service that
includes a trip from <LOCATION>Madrid</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Seville</LOCATION> on the AVE plus the train's normal
<DATE>summer</DATE> run from <LOCATION>Seville</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Cordoba</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Granada</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Malaga</LOCATION> and back to Seville.;  
 The Expo might make or break <LOCATION>Seville</LOCATION>. Andalusia in general -- and <LOCATION>Seville</LOCATION> in
particular -- are in bad economic shape. Spanish officials hope the fair will
attract future investments to the city and the province -- hence the big money
being put into fixing up the infrastructure.;     IF YOU'RE INTERESTED; For
general information about <LOCATION>Andalusia</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Seville</LOCATION> region, contact the

The Great Columbus Chase  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Arawak men, women and children stumble away, blood gushing from stumps --
in punishment for failing to meet the impossible gold-dust quotas of
<PERSON>Christopher Columbus</PERSON> and his crew.;    It is the beginning of <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>'
voyages to the Americas. And this unholy scene, repeated on later journeys, is
spun from <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>'s lust for gold and the Spanish desire for Christian
converts. This is the Eden-turned-hell that <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> misnames "the New
World.";    But in reality, it is an ancient, well-populated world. What
<LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> did not find in gold or converts, say some historians and social
critics, he made up for in blood: the enslavement and murder of the Taino and
Arawak peoples.;    "The historical facts are on record," says <PERSON>Hans Koning</PERSON>,
author of "Columbus: His Enterprise." "We've told our children he was a great
hero -- that's total hokum pokum. Columbus was not a force for the good. If an
entire race stood in his way, it had to go.";    This increasingly negative
reassessment of <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> is igniting a passionate international controversy
over the <DATE>1992</DATE> celebration of the 500th anniversary of the <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> voyage.;   
To celebrate the anniversary, a presidential commission was created by
<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1984</DATE> to coordinate activities in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and cooperate
with European planners. The organization -- the <ORGANIZATION>Quincentenary Jubilee
Commission</ORGANIZATION> -- drew fire from the beginning because no Indians were included on
the 30-member commission. There are four Hispanics, one African-American and
10 Italian-Americans on the panel.;    <ORGANIZATION>Commission</ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON>James Kuhn</PERSON>
downplays the question of the panel's racial makeup, saying, "We don't think
of it in these terms.";    But there are many critics who do. "Where's the
native point of view?" asks <PERSON>LaDonna Harris</PERSON>, a Comanche and founder of
Americans for Indian Opportunity in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION>;    Meanwhile, on both
sides of the <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION>, officials and hawkers are planning parties, media
events and T-shirt sales. Replicas of the <ORGANIZATION>Nina</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Pinta</ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION>Santa Maria</LOCATION>
will be displayed in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> in <DATE>October 1992</DATE>, after touring other
cities.;    "And guess what flag they'll be flying -- the <ORGANIZATION>Texaco</ORGANIZATION> flag," says
<PERSON>Roberto Ramirez</PERSON> of the <LOCATION>South Bay</LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION>Quincentennial Indigenous Council</ORGANIZATION>. "This
commercialization represents the mentality behind the official celebration."; 
  For <PERSON>Ramirez</PERSON> and others, <DATE>1992</DATE> is the remembrance of a holocaust in which
people were raped, tortured and killed. All for the sake of gold that wasn't
there and a religion that converted not a single Indian.;    "Five hundred
years of genocide is not a cause for celebration," says <PERSON>Charley Trujillo</PERSON>, a
San Jose publisher, author and historian. "We're supposed to celebrate a
holocaust? It's unthinkable.";    "It's like asking the world to celebrate
<PERSON>Hitler</PERSON>'s holocaust of the Jewish people," says <PERSON>Rosemary Richmond</PERSON>, of the
<ORGANIZATION>American Indian Community House</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. "I am an American Indian; this is
not my party.";    In response to increasing objection to the term
"celebration," <PERSON>Kuhn</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Jubilee Commission</ORGANIZATION> has said: "We don't call it a
celebration. We call it a commemoration.";    But critics still say things
smack of a celebration. For them, <DATE>1992</DATE> is instead a time to protest, to mourn,
to educate.;    "What must be done in <DATE>1992</DATE>," says <PERSON>Carlos Munoz</PERSON>, a UC-Berkeley
professor of political history, "is writing letters to the editor, protesting
official <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> events, alerting educators and commemorating the original
Americans in an alternative historical perspective.";    Welcome to the
alternative quincentennial movement and its growing thunder, as it rumbles
across all borders of race, religion and rank. For starters:;    (check) In
<LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>, the mayor of <LOCATION>Cadiz</LOCATION> has donated land for a monument to the victims of
European conquerors.;    (check) In <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION>, the <DATE>1991</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>Fourth Havana Biennial</ORGANIZATION> has
declared a "Challenge to Colonization.";    (check) At <ORGANIZATION>Stanford University</ORGANIZATION>,
artist-writer <PERSON>Jose Antonio Burciaga</PERSON> is distributing <PERSON>Koning</PERSON>'s book as "chain"
gifts to be passed on every two weeks: "People need to know what happened in
<DATE>1492</DATE> so they can figure what to do in <DATE>1992</DATE>.";    (check) And from the Submuloc
Society (<LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> spelled backward) at <ORGANIZATION>Salish Kootenai College</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Pablo</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Mont.</LOCATION>, the movement has a T-shirt: three ships within a circle crossed by a
diagonal line -- the international symbol for "not allowed.";   
Demonstrations began last year when activists, including Indian leader <PERSON>Russell
Means</PERSON>, protested a traveling <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> exhibit called "First Encounters,"
created by the <ORGANIZATION>Florida Museum of Natural History.</ORGANIZATION>;    "The exhibit should have
shown colonialism at work," says protest organizer <PERSON>Jan Elliott</PERSON> of the
<ORGANIZATION>Committee for American Indian History</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Gainesville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla.</LOCATION>;    An Indian
demonstrator was accused of "spoiling our children's fun." But, says <PERSON>Koning</PERSON>,
who was there, 'It's not innocent pleasure to celebrate an appalling
history.";    In response, the <ORGANIZATION>Houston Museum of Natural Science</ORGANIZATION> has canceled
the exhibit. Its next stop is the <ORGANIZATION>Southwest Museum of Science and Technology</ORGANIZATION>
in <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> on <DATE>Sept. 26</DATE>, where a protest will be staged <DATE>Oct. 12</DATE> by <PERSON>Elliott</PERSON>'s
coalition.;    "If people ask, 'What have you got against <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>?' -- they
don't know about the lie of <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>," says <PERSON>Elliott</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Cherokee Creole</ORGANIZATION> and
Ph.D candidate in Indian philosophy.;    But no protests are planned for the
Science Museum of <LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>St. Paul</LOCATION>. Its curator of ethnology, <PERSON>Dan Swan</PERSON>,
is working closely with Indians to illuminate the exhibit's eurocentrism and
to offer a multicultural perspective.;    Similarly in <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Jorge
Gonzales</PERSON> is part of <LOCATION>Santa Clara County</LOCATION>'s multiethnic, multiracial commission
to develop a multicultural response. "An objective is to include the
indigenous perspective," <PERSON>Gonzales</PERSON> says.;    <PERSON>Gonzales</PERSON> is a member of <ORGANIZATION>Raza Si</ORGANIZATION>,
an immigrant-rights advocacy organization, and the <LOCATION>South Bay</LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION>Quincentennial
Indigenous Council</ORGANIZATION>. On <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> the council will have a traditional Indian
feast, open to the public, at Mother <PERSON>Olson</PERSON>'s Inn in <LOCATION>San Jose.</LOCATION>;    "Native
people are taking a stand," says <PERSON>Norma Sanchez</PERSON> of the <PERSON>Muwekma-Ohlone Tribe</PERSON>,
who estimates 16,000 Indians live in <LOCATION>Santa Clara County</LOCATION>. "We will not
celebrate colonialism, but we will help people gain new understanding.";   
About 10,000 Ohlones live in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, according to <PERSON>Rosemary Cambra</PERSON>
of the <ORGANIZATION>Muwekma-Ohlone Tribe</ORGANIZATION>. "<ORGANIZATION>Hayward State University</ORGANIZATION> and UC-Berkeley are
planning Ohlone exhibits as part of an alternative response," she reports.;   
Likewise, <PERSON>Hugh Wire</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Council of Churches</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Santa Clara County</LOCATION> says, "In
<DATE>1992</DATE>, we'll work toward a restoration of Native American pride.";    From <LOCATION>New
York</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>National Council of Churches</ORGANIZATION> calls the Jubilee a legitimization "of
racial oppression" and vows to protest it through observances and events
across the nation.;    In cities where the indigenous perspective is ignored,
activists plan demonstrations through <DATE>1992</DATE>. "We may greet the ships in <LOCATION>San
Francisco</LOCATION> naked with our feathers and rubber-tipped bows and arrows," <PERSON>Elliott</PERSON>
says.;    In <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Solidarity Foundation</ORGANIZATION> plans a festival in <LOCATION>Central
Park</LOCATION> to counter the arrival of the tall ships in the harbor.;    Another
target is <LOCATION>Columbus Day</LOCATION>, <DATE>Oct. 12</DATE>. Indians object to glorifying a man they call
a false hero. The <DATE>1992</DATE> Alliance in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION>, plans a sunrise ceremony
this <ORGANIZATION>Columbus Day</ORGANIZATION> in front of the capitol.;    "We're declaring <DATE>1992</DATE> the Year
of the Indigenous People," says <PERSON>Suzan Harjo</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Cheyenne</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Creek Indian and
Alliance</ORGANIZATION> national coordinator. "We'll remember those who didn't survive the
European invasion; we'll celebrate those who have survived.";    Others are
declaring <DATE>Oct. 13</DATE> a Day of Mourning. Still others are calling for a moment to
an hour of silence on <DATE>Oct. 12</DATE>. Another plan is to celebrate <DATE>Oct. 11</DATE> as <ORGANIZATION>Native
People</ORGANIZATION>'s <DATE>Last Day</DATE> of Freedom.;    Last year, the <ORGANIZATION>American Indian Movement</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION> protested <ORGANIZATION>Columbus Day</ORGANIZATION> and unveiled an effigy of Hitler next to
<LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>' statue. Elliott's group will continue protesting a planned <MONEY>$100,000</MONEY>
Columbus statue in <LOCATION>Corpus Christi</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas.</LOCATION>;    Writer <PERSON>Jack Weatherford</PERSON> proposes
abolishing <ORGANIZATION>Columbus Day</ORGANIZATION>. Why honor a man "who opened the <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> slave trade
and launched one of the greatest waves of genocide known in history?" he
writes.;    "This gathering storm has already made an impact," says
<PERSON>Kirkpatrick Sale</PERSON>, author of "The Conquest of Paradise." "That's why the
national celebration is failing to get off the ground. There's an awareness
that celebration is not a moral response to <DATE>1992</DATE>.";    A moral response is the
counter-movement's call to action.;    Already there are plans for educational
conferences. Sale attended such a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION>National Society of Social
Studies Teachers</ORGANIZATION>. "To their credit," he says, "they're perplexed over how to
present the quincentenary to students. They realize a celebration is
inappropriate.";    Also at issue is the grade school notion of <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>
'discovering' <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>. Elliott calls it "the myth of an empty continent.";   
"Colon did not discover it," Sale writes. It was "well-known to the millions
of people . . . who had discovered (it) on behalf of the human species tens of
thousands of years before.";    Apologists for the "discovery" notion excuse
the term because the land was new to <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>. But <LOCATION>Richmond</LOCATION> says, "If I step
off a ship in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, I do not 'discover' it, even if it's 'new' to me.";   
Eurocentric racism feeds this myth, says <PERSON>Peter McDonald</PERSON>, former Native
American Indian bibliographer at <ORGANIZATION>New York Public Library</ORGANIZATION>, now with <ORGANIZATION>Cornell
University</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Northeast Indian Quarterly.</ORGANIZATION>;    "The idea of a white person
'discovering' a continent -- already populated from sea to shining sea -- is
absurd," <ORGANIZATION>McDonald</ORGANIZATION> says. "The Incas, the Aztecs had astronomy, engineering,
mathematics, hygiene, an agriculture far in advance of anything in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>.";  
 The myth of <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>, he adds, "numbs us to the truth of how this continent
was stolen in a ruthless expanse, leaving a trail of broken promises leading
up to today.";    In response to such criticism, Jubilee commissioner <PERSON>Kuhn</PERSON> has
said: "I may have said discovery in the past, but now I refer to it as an
encounter.";    "Calling it an 'encounter' is an attempt to hoodwink people,"
<ORGANIZATION>McDonald</ORGANIZATION> says. "Raping, murdering, enslaving people is hardly an 'encounter'
of two cultures.";    Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION>Hollywood</ORGANIZATION> is producing two <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> films,
one written by <PERSON>Mario Puzo</PERSON> and the other directed by <PERSON>Ridley Scott</PERSON>. Activists
don't expect either to tell the true tale of <PERSON>Christopher Columbus</PERSON>. However,
<PERSON>Koning</PERSON> says, "Actor <PERSON>Tim Robbins</PERSON> has written a play based on my book, and he
hopes to talk to <PERSON>Ridley Scott</PERSON> about it.";    Whatever happens during the next
year and a half, Sale says, "when <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> is talked about from now on, it
will be with a greater awareness.";    <PERSON>Adds Koning</PERSON>, "It may seem a pity to let
go of <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> as part of our national lore, but we cannot in good faith
celebrate this man nor the quincentenary. False heroes have too long burdened
our history. If people really want to do something in <DATE>1992</DATE>, tell them to talk
with a Native American.";    It's a good idea, says <PERSON>June LeGrand</PERSON>, radio host
for "The Living Spirit" on KKUP-FM and co-founder of the <LOCATION>South Bay
Quincentennial Indigenous Council.</LOCATION>;    "We've been invisible for so long.
Until the world heals its relationship to Indian people, there can be no
harmony on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. <DATE>1992</DATE> offers us a chance to finally meet all of our brothers
and sisters."  </TEXT>

TREASURE HUNT  </HEADLINE>

Francisco State University. She is this year's winner of the reviewing

<TEXT>  HarperCollins, 384 pp., <MONEY>$21.95</MONEY>;  THERE has already been a lot of hype about
"The Crown of <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>," and there is probably going to be a lot more. The
novel sold for an enormous amount of money (the advance alone was an
unprecedented three-quarters of a <MONEY>million dollars</MONEY>). The <ORGANIZATION>Book-of-the-Month Club</ORGANIZATION>
has bid on it, so have the magazines and translators; <PERSON>Michelle Pfeiffer</PERSON> owns
the movie rights.;    The authors, <PERSON>Michael Dorris</PERSON> and <PERSON>Louise Erdrich</PERSON>, are
already on a national publicity tour. Handsome and appealing, they make fine
spokespeople for their own work and provide unusually interesting copy for
articles and interviews. Both are of mixed American Indian descent, and both
grew up, at least partly, on reservations. They have been married 10 years and
are raising six children together. Prize-winning authors on their own
(<ORGANIZATION>Erdrich</ORGANIZATION>'s "Love Medicine" won the <ORGANIZATION>National Book Critics Circle Award</ORGANIZATION> for
Fiction in <DATE>1984</DATE>, and <PERSON>Dorris</PERSON>' "The Broken Cord" won the <ORGANIZATION>National Book Critics
Circle Award</ORGANIZATION> for Non-Fiction in <DATE>1989</DATE>), the two are used to reading and
commenting on each other's work, but they have never openly collaborated on a
full-length book before.;    And the book? Well, it's great. "The Crown of
<LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>" feels exactly like the family-written book it is. Unpretentious and
engaging, it has more charm and humor than readers may have found in earlier
<PERSON>Dorris</PERSON> and/or <PERSON>Erdrich</PERSON> works, without sacrificing any of the intelligence or
feeling. The very first sentence ("In the warm pink-gold of a <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION>
afternoon, something marvelous washed up from the sea") sets the tone, and
this light and literate quality lasts throughout the book.;    The plot
focuses on the on-again, off-again romance between two very different
<LOCATION>Dartmouth</LOCATION> professors as they try to second-guess <PERSON>Christopher Columbus</PERSON> -- who
he was, what he wanted, what his legacy to <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> really consisted of.;   
<PERSON>Vivian Twostar</PERSON>, who narrates part of the book, is a spunky, outspoken
40-year-old single mother who teaches American Indian studies in the
anthropology department. Forced by the requirements of her tenure year to
write an article on <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>, whom she refers to sarcastically as "<PERSON>Mr.
Navigator</PERSON>," <PERSON>Vivian</PERSON> begins her research with reluctance. She wants what every
"other sensible person of full or partial American Indian descent" wants --
that is, she wants to nail him.;    <PERSON>Vivian</PERSON> has a clear idea of what life was
like for her people before <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> landed. The Indians on the tiny island of
<LOCATION>Guanahani</LOCATION>, in the <LOCATION>Bahamas</LOCATION>, were, she tells us, "a healthy pleasure-loving
group, laid-back beach bums and surfers, with absolutely no aptitude for
destruction." They lived in "an endless <DATE>summer</DATE> of surf and starry nights"
until, in <DATE>1492</DATE>, the fateful sails of the <ORGANIZATION>Nina</ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION>Pinta</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Santa Maria</LOCATION>
appeared on the horizon. Then, Vivian fumes, they all ran down to meet the
ships -- they had, after all, no reason to think the Spaniards weren't simply
bringing "more good news.";    <PERSON>Roger Williams</PERSON>, an elegant, emotionally inept
academician who talks to students and fellow professors using the "odd,
two-fingered hand position Christ used in <LOCATION>Bible</LOCATION> story illustrations," is
writing about <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> for different reasons: He is interested in the man as
an Italian who sailed for <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>, a Jew who converted to Christianity, a
navigator who never found the "Orient" he aimed for. Roger, a narrative poet,
is writing an unrhymed monologue titled "Diary of a Lost Man" that starts with
<LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>' admission: "I do not know myself.";    The two, <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> and <PERSON>Vivian</PERSON>,
have a comic confrontation in the <LOCATION>Dartmouth</LOCATION> library when <PERSON>Roger</PERSON>'s cough alerts
<PERSON>Vivian</PERSON>'s anger. "The first European who stood on the North American continent
and coughed," <PERSON>Vivian</PERSON> remembers, "probably indirectly killed more Indians than
. . . <PERSON>Custer</PERSON> ever imagined in his favorite wet dream." They fall in love, but
break apart when <PERSON>Vivian</PERSON> learns she is pregnant. They stay apart until <PERSON>Roger</PERSON>
learns to develop "a tolerance for change" that includes accepting <PERSON>Vivian</PERSON>, her
teen-age son <PERSON>Nash</PERSON> ("just spell it G-N-A-S-H"), her irritable Navajo
grandmother and their new baby, Violet -- the "whole unruly entourage.";    In
the meantime, both continue to track down information on <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>. They agree
on one fact: <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> was a slave trader. The gold he failed to find in the
New World he supplanted with natives he bragged would make "good and
intelligent servants" for Spain.;    But what are these references to a
mysterious "crown" in the journals and notes? When a sinister millionaire
named <ORGANIZATION>Cobb</ORGANIZATION> offers to help put the pieces together, <PERSON>Vivian</PERSON>, <PERSON>Roger</PERSON>, <PERSON>Nash</PERSON> and the
baby fly to his mansion in the <LOCATION>Bahamas</LOCATION>. Roger sees nothing but fleas and
mosquitoes on the tropical island, and <PERSON>Vivian</PERSON>'s view is also bleak: The "poor
soil, bright colors, dark people, junked automobiles" all remind her of a
reservation. Cobb's private beach is, however, the promised paradise. And as
<ORGANIZATION>Cobb</ORGANIZATION>'s clues tally with <PERSON>Vivian</PERSON>'s, the race to find the "real" <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> speeds
up.;     "The Crown of <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>" is an old-fashioned treasure-hunt story that
offers a little bit for everyone -- there are bats, sharks, caves,
kidnappings, codes and karate chops, as well as poems by <PERSON>Donne</PERSON> and <PERSON>Roger
Williams</PERSON>, entries from <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>' diary, Navajo chants and wonderful
descriptions of university librarians, childbirth and stoned 16-year-old boys.
The only thing missing is the recipe for <PERSON>Vivian</PERSON>'s chili.;     There are, to be
sure, some flat parts and some thin characters. Columbus himself remains sadly
elusive. There is a <ORGANIZATION>Nancy Drew-gets-together-with-the-Hardy-Boys</ORGANIZATION> quality that
may put off the sophisticated. But the good spirit of the book is contagious,
and that, essentially, is what makes it so effective.;    "The Crown of
<LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>" feels as if it was written in fun, conceived and constructed in an
atmosphere of camaraderie, respect and good faith. If only <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> had landed
on our shores with half these qualities . . .  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  Three Viking ships sailed up the Potomac River on Wednesday, commemorating
Leif Ericson's landing in the New World about 1,000 years ago and challenging
the 500th anniversary hoopla celebrating that Christopher-come-lately.;   The
78-foot flagship Gaia, a replica of the wooden, single-masted Viking longboat,
docked at a Georgetown wharf shortly before noon on Leif Ericson Day after a
5,300-mile voyage across the North Atlantic that began May 17 in Bergen,
Norway.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The Gaia and two Viking escort vessels that joined the voyage at <LOCATION>Nova

cheers from a dockside crowd that included President <PERSON>Vigdis Finnbogadottir</PERSON> of
<LOCATION>Iceland</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Queen Sonja of Norway.</ORGANIZATION>;   Also welcoming the <ORGANIZATION>Norse</ORGANIZATION> sailors was
former Vice President <PERSON>Walter Mondale</PERSON>, a Minnesotan of Norwegian stock. Playing
it safe, he praised the epic voyages of both <PERSON>Ericson</PERSON> and <PERSON>Christopher Columbus</PERSON>
as "victories of the human spirit.";   Speaking to a reporter, <PERSON>Mondale</PERSON>
recalled being spanked as a child for bragging, but on this occasion he
couldn't resist.;   "We got here 500 years early," he said, beaming. "We
didn't need any money. We just did it.";   No one knows exactly when or where
<PERSON>Ericson</PERSON> landed in the <LOCATION>New World</LOCATION>. Many scholars believe the Vikings reached the
northern coast of <LOCATION>Newfoundland</LOCATION> about 1,000 years ago and settled there for a
year before returning home.;   <PERSON>Ericson</PERSON> called the place "Vinland."
Archaeologists have found the remains of an early Viking settlement at
L'Anse-aux-Meadows on the northern tip of <LOCATION>Newfoundland</LOCATION> but none of the grape
vines that <PERSON>Ericson</PERSON> is said to have found there.;   After the speechmaking and
a celebratory lunch, the Icelandic president and the Norwegian queen paid a
courtesy call on President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION>, thus deftly upstaging
<ORGANIZATION>Cristobal Colon</ORGANIZATION>, a 20th-generation direct descendant of Columbus.;   <ORGANIZATION>Colon</ORGANIZATION>, a
42-year-old Spanish naval officer, wasn't scheduled to meet <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> until today.
He is touring the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> to help celebrate <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> Day and launch
yearlong festivities celebrating the 500th anniversary of his ancestor's
landing in the <LOCATION>New World.</LOCATION>;   The Smithsonian Institution is sponsoring a

<P>
Is there room on the <LOCATION>Atlantic Ocean</LOCATION> -- and on the big screen -- for two 
<PERSON>Christopher Columbuses</PERSON>? 
</P>
<P>
There was room last week in the trade papers for splashy multi-page ads touting 
two such projects, both to be released in <DATE>1992</DATE> to capitalize on the 500th 
anniversary of the Italian explorer's voyage to <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION> in the service of 
<LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Producers <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> and <PERSON>Ilya Salkind</PERSON> are working with a script by <PERSON>Mario Puzo</PERSON>, 
"Christopher Columbus: The Movie," with plans to begin shooting in <DATE>April</DATE>. They 
claim to have "exclusive" access to <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>'s full-size re-creations of the <ORGANIZATION>Nina</ORGANIZATION>, 
<ORGANIZATION>Pinta</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Santa Maria</LOCATION>, now under construction. The father-and-son team 
responsible for the "Superman" movies will also "use members of the Spanish 
navy as extras," a spokesman tells us. 
</P>
<P>
To be budgeted at <MONEY>$45</MONEY>-<MONEY>$50 million</MONEY>, the Salkinds' film is planned as a <DATE>July 4, 
1992</DATE>, global release, with <ORGANIZATION>Universal Pictures</ORGANIZATION> handling domestic distribution. A 
source reports that <PERSON>David Lean</PERSON> is being considered as director. 
</P>
<P>
Undaunted, producer-director <PERSON>Ridley Scott</PERSON> plans "<PERSON>Christopher Columbus</PERSON>," from a 
script by French journalist <PERSON>Roselyne Bosch</PERSON>. It will "go beyond the history 
books" to tell "the truth about the man and what happened," says a Scott 
spokeswoman. The film's star -- and start date -- will be announced shortly. 
</P>
<P>
What about the <PERSON>Salkinds</PERSON>' claim to ties with the Spanish government? 
</P>
<P>
"We've had some of the same conversations (with Spanish officials) and they're 
supportive," says the <PERSON>Scott</PERSON> spokeswoman. "<DATE>1992</DATE> is a big year for <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>. They 
won't care if there are 10 films about <PERSON>Christopher Columbus</PERSON>." <PERSON>Pat H. Broeske</PERSON>

<TEXT>     Q: Yes, it has, <PERSON>Mr. Columbus</PERSON>. You wouldn't recognize it.;    A: Well, I bet
they have a lot more Indians. Those people were everywhere.;    Q: We call
them Native Americans now, <PERSON>Mr. Columbus</PERSON>. And they are virtually nowhere. They
were mostly killed by the white men.;    A: What are you talking! What is this
American stuff? I was sailing to India.;    Q: No, <PERSON>Mr. Columbus</PERSON>, that was
<LOCATION>America</LOCATION>. We call this part of it the <LOCATION>United States of America</LOCATION> now.;    A: The
world has gone wacky. If it wasn't <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>, why didn't they call it
Columbusland? I discovered it.;    Q: Well, they named it after <PERSON>Amerigo
Vespucci</PERSON>. He was an Italian. They do have a city called <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Ohio.</LOCATION>;   
A: <PERSON>Vespucci</PERSON>. They named it after him? That Mafioso! And where is <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>? Did I
discover it?;    Q: No, <PERSON>Mr. Columbus</PERSON>. It was discovered by early Native
Americans.;    A: Again with the Native Americans. I tell you, I can recognize
an Indian at 5,000 feet! Why did you change the name?;    Q: It was
politically correct.;    A: What? What kind of word is that? My New World
sounds all messed up.;    Q: Well, it has changed. A lot of people claim now
that you were no hero. That you were a tyrant who cut off the natives' hands.;
   A: So?;    Q: You admit it?;    A: I'm not sure. You sound sneaky. What
does <PERSON>Queen Isabella</PERSON> say?;    Q: She's dead.;    A: Good. She brought me home
in chains. You want to talk meanness, you should mention that. And she had
promised me a few nice acres for a home in <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>. I bet <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> has
changed.;    Q: It's very crowded. Very hard to find a few nice acres in
<LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>. Did you have any special dreams for your New World?;    A: Of course.
I wanted to open a chain of <ORGANIZATION>Columbus Pizza Shops</ORGANIZATION>. They didn't know what pizza
was when I landed. The Indians would have loved it. You can't beat Italian
food.;    Q: There are lots of pizza shops in America.;    A: The West
Indies!;    Q: There, too.;    A: Well, I was a man ahead of my time. I could
have used the <LOCATION>Pinta</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Santa Maria</LOCATION> for cruises, you know, for tourists.
Could have charged 20, 30 lire a trip.;    Q: You could get thousands of
dollars now. And millions of lire.;    A: Ahead of my time. Tell me, did they
ever discover <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>?;    Q: You know about that?;    A: Of course. It was
my secret. I was going to build a huge amusement park there.;    Q: Amazing!
There is a huge amusement park there! Disneyland. And there's <ORGANIZATION>Disney World</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>!;    A: On my acres, I bet! Selling pizza all over the place! I was
badly treated. The New World is a rip-off joint!;    Q: Well, if it is, lots
of people think you started it. By your greed and cruelty.;    A: MY greed?
They don't call it <LOCATION>Columbusland</LOCATION>, do they? They don't call it <LOCATION>Columbus World</LOCATION>,
do they? What about this guy <ORGANIZATION>Disney</ORGANIZATION>?;    Q: He was a great pioneer!;    A:
Yeah. He had a better agent than my guy. Took my land and my pizza. Tell me,
do they celebrate my birthday in the Indies?;    Q: In <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>, yes, they do,
but there is considerable protest over that now.;    A: Why, for God's sake?; 
  Q: They say you really didn't discover anything. There were tens of
thousands of Native Americans already there when you got there.;    A: Yeah,
but we got there! On three stinking little ships. With all sorts of rotten
sailors. And we didn't fall off the end of the world, either. I told them they
wouldn't. And now they say I didn't discover the place. Boy. That <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> is a
rip-off.;    Q: Would you like to apologize?;    A: To whom?;    Q: To the
Indians -- the Native Americans!;    A: Listen, maybe we can work a deal. I
could get a few of those acres in <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, and I would give them a couple of
trinkets. Or beads. Those people loved beads in the old days!;    Q: They have
wised up.;    A: How about six pesos for <LOCATION>Manhattan Island</LOCATION>?;    Q: Somebody
already worked that deal. And now 2 1/2 million people live on <LOCATION>Manhattan
Island</LOCATION>!;    A: <PERSON>Holy Isabella</PERSON>. That many! Those Indians are everywhere. Tell me
something.;    Q: Yes.;    A: Could I maybe open a couple of pizza huts on
that island?;    Q: Too late, <LOCATION>Chris.</LOCATION>;    A: Yeah. Rip-off. How about

SOUTHERN SPAIN JUMPING TOWARD 21ST CENTURY;

<P>
WORLD'S FAIR: ANDALUSIA AND THE CITY OF SEVILLE ARE UNDERGOING THE GREATEST 
FACE LIFT IN THEIR HISTORY.

SEVILLE, Spain 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four bridges span the indolent <LOCATION>Guadalquivir River</LOCATION> here today, legacy of 20 
centuries of settlement that began in Roman times. Over the next three years, 
seven new bridges will be built across the muddy river that is <LOCATION>Seville</LOCATION>'s 
trademark and its lifeblood. 
</P>
<P>
Storied <LOCATION>Seville</LOCATION>, one giant detour now, is in the throes of the greatest face 
lift in its history. Dazzling modernization for the regional capital is the 
cornerstone of a regional development scheme that will yank flamenco-and-sherry 
<LOCATION>Andalusia</LOCATION> pell-mell into the 21st Century. Amid great expectation, and some 
disquiet, the era of the superlative has come to laggard southern <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The catalyst is a <DATE>1992</DATE> world's fair, Expo <DATE>'92</DATE>, that will be this century's last 
and, yes, history's biggest. 
</P>
<P>
The Spanish government, with a big financial assist from the <ORGANIZATION>European 
Community</ORGANIZATION>, is investing <MONEY>$7 billion</MONEY> to bring the rickety Andalusian 
infrastructure up to continental standards. A self-financing state corporation 
will spend <MONEY>$800 million</MONEY> to prepare the exhibition site on 538-acre La <LOCATION>Cartuja 
Island</LOCATION> in the middle of the river. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of millions more will come from 170 exhibitors at Expo itself -- 101 
countries have signed up so far -- and from off-site private investors hoping 
to cash in with everything from souvenir shops to luxury hotels. 
</P>
<P>
Roads, a high-speed railroad, expanded regional airports, a refurbished port, 
and high-tech telecommunications are all wending their way from drawing boards 
to the streets and countryside of <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>'s most populous region. 
</P>
<P>
In the Spanish matrix, <LOCATION>Andalusia</LOCATION>, with <PERCENT>17%</PERCENT> of the national population but only 
<PERCENT>12%</PERCENT> of national income, is renowned more for graceful languor than dynamism. 
What is being called <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>'s most ambitious project of the '90s is expected to 
generate 200,000 jobs for a region whose unemployment is higher than in the 
rest of <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Even in its early earthmoving, pipe-laying stages, regional development is 
having great impact: <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> will grow economically <PERCENT>5%</PERCENT> this year; <LOCATION>Andalusia</LOCATION> <PERCENT>6.8%</PERCENT>. 
</P>
<P>
By the time Expo's 176-night run ends on the 500th anniversary of <PERSON>Christopher 
Columbus</PERSON>' arrival in the <LOCATION>New World</LOCATION>, <DATE>Oct. 12, 1992</DATE>, it will have reached into 
the lives of all 6.8 million Andalusians. 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>Seville</LOCATION>, now wed mostly to tourism, will get its first ring road, and be linked 
to the rest of <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> by multi-lane expressways for the first time. A bullet 
train will halve travel time from <LOCATION>Madrid</LOCATION> to three hours, and passengers will 
detrain at a spanking new <LOCATION>Seville</LOCATION> terminal. 
</P>
<P>
Regional airports at <LOCATION>Seville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Malaga</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Jerez</LOCATION> will lose their provincial air. 
The phones will work. 
</P>
<P>
Such are the promises of officials at the autonomous regional Andalusian 
government who are overseeing the construction. 
</P>
<P>
"We are providing investment that <LOCATION>Andalusia</LOCATION> needs in an accelerated form. 
Necessary improvements that might be scheduled over 15 or 20 years will instead 
be accomplished in three," said <PERSON>Jaime Montaner</PERSON>, public works minister for the 
regional government who is overseeing the construction. 
</P>
<P>
The overall project is enormous, though, and amid traffic-jammed, 
construction-everywhere inconvenience, nerves are already jangling. 
</P>
<P>
"<LOCATION>Seville</LOCATION> is uncomfortable, but everybody in <LOCATION>Seville</LOCATION> wants Expo. We all 
understand that it is worth suffering now for the benefits that will come 
later," <PERSON>Montaner</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
With the fair pledged to open <DATE>Easter Monday, April 20, 1992</DATE>, construction 
deadlines are inelastic. A road finished months late may benefit <LOCATION>Andalusia</LOCATION> as 
much in the long run but in the interim may imperil Expo's success and 
embarrass <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> with the whole world watching. 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> will mark <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>' anniversary as its own coming of age in a uniting 
<LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>. In addition to <ORGANIZATION>Expo</ORGANIZATION>, it will sponsor the <DATE>1992</DATE> Summer Olympics in 
<LOCATION>Barcelona</LOCATION>, a European Cultural Year in <LOCATION>Madrid</LOCATION>, and a major exhibit in <LOCATION>Toledo</LOCATION> 
celebrating <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>'s Jewish and Muslim heritage. 
</P>
<P>
Planners expect that 18 million visitors will come to <LOCATION>Seville</LOCATION>'s Expo, and pay 
an average daily admission price of about <MONEY>$20</MONEY> to see a fair conceived as a 
cross between a Disney extravaganza and a classical exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
Montaner promises that <LOCATION>Andalusia</LOCATION> will not disappoint them. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no cause for alarm. On the contrary, things are moving well. 
Everything is on schedule. It's a great challenge, but we'll be ready," he told 
a visitor to his office in the cobblestones-and-tourists old quarter of a city 
that became one of the richest in the world when it enjoyed a 16th-Century 
monopoly of trade with what is now <LOCATION>Latin America</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Amid the bulldozers and tumbled red earth on the Expo island, <PERSON>Jacinto Pellon</PERSON>, 
the bearded engineer and weekend sailor who is chief executive of the <ORGANIZATION>Seville 
Universal Exposition</ORGANIZATION> <DATE>1992</DATE>, is equally upbeat. 
</P>
<P>
"On site, we are on time. We are pushing the exhibitors to begin their own 
construction next <DATE>spring</DATE>," he said, describing his project as "something like 
Epcot, but a bit more serious, and with a lot of entertainment; rock to ballet 
to symphonic music to experimental theater." 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Information Agency</ORGANIZATION> will sponsor the <MONEY>$20-million</MONEY> American pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
Columbus is the star of what is technically a <ORGANIZATION>Universal Exposition</ORGANIZATION> in the 
tradition of the only other three of the breed since World War II: <LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION> 
'58, <LOCATION>Montreal</LOCATION> '67, and <LOCATION>Osaka</LOCATION> '70. 
</P>
<P>
It was in the 15th-Century Carthusian monastery of <LOCATION>Santa Maria</LOCATION> de las Cuevas on 
La <LOCATION>Cartuja Island</LOCATION> that <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> planned his journey. He lived behind the thick 
monastery walls between trips and was buried there for a time. 
</P>
<P>
The monastery itself, later converted to a ceramics factory that operated until 
<DATE>1982</DATE>, is being restored, nave to frescoes, as the symbol of an exhibition that 
will also feature the replica of the 15th-Century port of <LOCATION>Seville</LOCATION> whence the 
Admiral of the Ocean Sea ventured west with the <ORGANIZATION>Nina</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Pinta</ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION>Santa 
Maria</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Exposition chief <ORGANIZATION>Pellon</ORGANIZATION> says Expo will draw on past international extravaganzas 
such as the <LOCATION>Osaka</LOCATION> fair and the <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> Olympics, but with an important 
difference. After Expo ends, the island and many of its structures will become 
a center for university instruction and corporate research and development. 
</P>
<P>
Another of the lasting benefits will be construction of the the first 
full-blown opera house for a city to which opera is no stranger: "Barber of 
<LOCATION>Seville</LOCATION>" to "Carmen" to "Fidelio" and "<PERSON>Don Giovanni</PERSON>."

<LEADPARA>  Norwegians have been miffed for centuries about Christopher Columbus stealing

<HEADLINE>  NEW THEORY ON COLUMBUS' NATIONALITY
CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE SUGGESTS HE WAS NORWEGIAN,
HISTORIAN SAYS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Tor <PERSON>Busch Sannes</PERSON> does not claim to have definitive proof. Instead, he cites
a series of coincidences, historical fact and imaginative interpretation he
hopes historians will investigate further.;    His book, "<PERSON>Christopher Columbus</PERSON>
-- A European from <LOCATION>Norway</LOCATION>?" suggests that <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> was a Norwegian nobleman
named <PERSON>Christopher Bonde</PERSON> who discovered <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> in <DATE>1477</DATE>, not in 1492.;   
<LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> actually undertook a voyage north of <LOCATION>Iceland</LOCATION> in <DATE>1477</DATE>, according to
the <ORGANIZATION>World Book Encyclopedia</ORGANIZATION>. Sannes argues that voyage could have reached
<LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> or <LOCATION>New England</LOCATION> 15 years before <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> laid anchor in the <LOCATION>West Indies</LOCATION>
in 1492.;    Late celebration;    "<LOCATION>America</LOCATION> is getting ready to celebrate the
500th anniversary (of <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>' discovery) 15 years too late," <PERSON>Sannes</PERSON> said.;  
 The book has generated considerable news coverage, skepticism and amusement
in <LOCATION>Norway</LOCATION>. Some see it as belated revenge for overlooking the Viking seafarer
<PERSON>Ericson</PERSON>'s discovery of <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION> nearly 500 years earlier.;    Many
Norwegians believe <PERSON>Ericson</PERSON> was one of their countrymen. But historians believe
he was actually born in <LOCATION>Iceland</LOCATION> of a Norwegian father.;    <PERSON>Knut Utstein
Kloster</PERSON>, the millionaire shipowner who funded <PERSON>Sannes</PERSON>' work, said he didn't
know whether <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> was a Norwegian, and neither did <PERSON>Sannes</PERSON>. "But this is an
exciting story that should inspire researchers and others to carry on work
with the theory," he said.;    Historical possibilities;    "Circumstantial
evidence cannot be considered definitive proof," <PERSON>Sannes</PERSON> agreed. "But I hope
that the possibility will be seriously researched by historians.";    History
books generally say <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> was born in <DATE>1451</DATE>, the son of an impoverished
weaver from <LOCATION>Genoa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>, named <PERSON>Domenico</PERSON> and his wife, Suzanna.;    Historians
dispute the details of the explorer's clouded childhood. Several countries --
including <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> -- claim him as a native son. <PERSON>Sannes</PERSON> said
the historical evidence just as easily could lead to a conclusion that
<LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> was born in <LOCATION>Norway.</LOCATION>;    "The most convincing evidence was <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>'
coat of arms," <PERSON>Sannes</PERSON> said. In the position designating a father's lineage, it
bears an emblem identical to that used by the <PERSON>Bonde</PERSON> family, he said.;    The
noble Bondes;    <PERSON>Sannes</PERSON> said <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>' father could have been a member of the
noble <PERSON>Bonde</PERSON> family who he believes fled to <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> in the <DATE>1400s</DATE> to avoid
persecution in <LOCATION>Norway.</LOCATION>;    <PERSON>Sannes</PERSON> cited other bits of evidence: <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> never
wrote in Italian, he called himself a foreigner in southern <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> and he was
described in some biographies as tall, fair and blue-eyed -- typical Nordic
characteristics.;    The book suggests that <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> was invited to join the
<DATE>1477</DATE> Iceland expedition because he learned to sail in Nordic waters as a
Norwegian youngster in <LOCATION>Nordfjord</LOCATION>, on <LOCATION>Norway</LOCATION>'s midwestern coast.;   
<ORGANIZATION>Nordfjord</ORGANIZATION>'s mayor, <PERSON>Nils R. Sandal</PERSON>, is skeptical of such theories. "I think
we'll drag our feet for a while before raising any <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> monuments in
Nordfjord," he said, adding jokingly that town residents should search their
attics for any Norwegian-language letters written by <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>.  </TEXT>

FT  15 APR 92 / Survey of Seville and World Expo '92 (7): The renaissance
filled his sails - The Europe in which Columbus launched his great adventure
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
NO-ONE should belittle <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>'s determination to make the world recognise
<DATE>1992</DATE> as a turning point in its modern history.
The Spanish regard their homeland as <LOCATION>Western Europe</LOCATION>'s last frontier. Five
hundred years ago it still remained undecided whether their portion of the
Iberian Peninsula formed the northernmost outpost of <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> or the
south-western extremity of <LOCATION>Christendom</LOCATION>. <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> was located on the wrong side
of the <LOCATION>Pyrenees</LOCATION>.
More, it had been occupied by the Moslems too long, in parts for almost 800
years. And who ruled <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>? Kings or cardinals or robber knights or the
<LOCATION>Hermandad</LOCATION>, the powerful organisation of 'brotherhoods' that originated as a
militia policing the regions and doubled as a national tax-collecting
agency? But times were ready for change when IsabelIa of <LOCATION>Castile</LOCATION> married
<ORGANIZATION>Ferdinand of Aragon</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1469</DATE>, against strong popular feeling in both states
and while neither was as yet a crowned head. The financing of <ORGANIZATION>Ferdinand</ORGANIZATION>'s
suit, quite beyond the capacity of his bankrupt father <PERSON>King John of Aragon</PERSON>,
was provided by Jewish financiers in the royal employ, acting in collusion
with a Catalan official of the <ORGANIZATION>Vatican</ORGANIZATION>, the future <ORGANIZATION>Borgia Pope Alexander VI</ORGANIZATION>.
IsabelIa was 18, Ferdinand a year younger. Unlike <LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION>, which prospered
by espousing the <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> as a second province, <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> was an unmade bed.
Much of <LOCATION>Andalucia</LOCATION> in the south still remained Moslem territory. The
Reconquista, called a crusade, was not yet completed in <DATE>1491</DATE>. Concentration
on the mission had created an inward-looking Spanish people of passionate
intensity.
This was accompanied by intermarriage on a scale to make it difficult to
discern whether an individual was of Christian or Hebrew or Arab descent.
A mountainous land dry as dust bred a dogged population attached to their
patch. This national introspection goes some way to account for the ferocity
of the Civil War in the <DATE>20th century</DATE> which cost three quarters of a million
lives, and the fact that <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> kept out of this century's two great European
conflagrations.
The voyage of <PERSON>Christopher Columbus</PERSON> as a Spanish enterprise owed nothing to
the young monarchs' empire-building desires. They had no such ambition. The
man from <LOCATION>Genoa</LOCATION> had peddled his proposition to a succession of rulers, but
without success. He first appealed to <PERSON>King John</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION>, only to be
rebuffed. Columbus next approached <PERSON>Isabella</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Ferdinand</LOCATION>, again being
refused. Then, in desperation, he besought the brilliant Regent of <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>,
<PERSON>Anne</PERSON> of Beaujeu; and finally <PERSON>Henry VII</PERSON> of <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>.
None was interested. They exhausted their wealth in battles over ownership
of a town, or a river, or a forest within <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>. But they were deaf to the
concept of a second shore to the <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> where, according to <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>,
realms beyond dreams were available for the taking.
He returned to <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>, waiting impatiently outside the royal headquarters
during the protracted campaign against <ORGANIZATION>Granada</ORGANIZATION>. Years passed before the
Queen's advisers, notably the baptised <PERSON>Jew Luis de Santangel</PERSON>, persuaded her
to grant <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> her patronage. What had she to lose, they urged, with a
negligible gamble of three tiny caravels? They had just hoisted the royal
standard, together with a huge silver cross given by the Pope, on the
<LOCATION>Alhambra</LOCATION>, the defeated Moorish kingdom's architectural masterpiece.
Because <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> stole the historic moment for his perilous adventure into
the unknown, the immense strategic achievement in closing the Straits of
<LOCATION>Gibraltar</LOCATION> against exit by Ottoman fleets remained for a time unremarked. It
was as crucial to the future of the European races as the annexation of
<LOCATION>America</LOCATION>. The Catholic monarchs had thereby locked the Sultan of <LOCATION>Turkey</LOCATION>
within the <LOCATION>Mediterranean</LOCATION>.
Had the <ORGANIZATION>Sublime Porte</ORGANIZATION> been able to pass its ships into the <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> it could
well have encircled this continent. Turkey was already master of the greater
portion of south-eastern <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>. Western countries lay unprotected on their
oceanic side, the Portuguese being too few to engage a major enemy. <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>
was preoccupied with internal consolidation and in eternal dispute with
others over the Low Countries, while <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> had not yet recovered from the
wounds of the Hundred Years War or the Wars of the Roses.
To be sure, <LOCATION>Turkey</LOCATION> may not have succeeded in replacing Christianity with
Islam in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, but physical control was all the <ORGANIZATION>Crescent</ORGANIZATION> aspired to, as in
the <LOCATION>Balkans</LOCATION>. Ventures deep into the <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> would then have been automatic,
with the New World doubtless given another conqueror and a different
history. Moslem mariners were no less skilled than the European, as witness
their navigation of the <ORGANIZATION>Indian Ocean</ORGANIZATION> as far as the Malabar coast. Portuguese
ships hugged the western shores of <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> but had not as yet properly
rounded the <LOCATION>Cape</LOCATION>.
Amazingly, <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> itself, when <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> planted Isabella's banner on the
Arawak island he baptised <LOCATION>San Salvador</LOCATION> on <DATE>October 12, 1492</DATE>, counted no more
than as a mere promontory hanging precariously over the ledge of <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION>.
<LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> comprised a jigsaw of statelets torn by perennial strife.
Eastwards, <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> was ever dangerously exposed to a resolute predator.
Following the conquest of <LOCATION>Constantinople</LOCATION> in <DATE>1453</DATE> there seemed no stopping
the Turk. He would reach the outskirts of <LOCATION>Vienna</LOCATION> in <DATE>1519</DATE>, to hold the
Austrian capital in siege for a further century and a half. He had swallowed
<LOCATION>Hungary</LOCATION> and threatened <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION>, while Muscovy had only recently shaken off
Tatar tutelage.
Only in <DATE>1571</DATE> did <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>, now the greatest European power, manage to clip the
Sultan's sails at <ORGANIZATION>Lepanto</ORGANIZATION> in Greek waters, where Cervantes lost an arm. The
long retreat and decline of the Ottomans on land had not yet begun.
Returning to the annus mirabilis of <DATE>1492</DATE>, we find the young Ferdinand mostly
apathetic to <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> and the consequences of a new continent joined to
<LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>. Ownership of the colonies came specifically to <LOCATION>Isabella</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Castile</LOCATION>.
Ferdinand was busy scheming his way into the possession of the southern half
of <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>. A minor princeling on his marriage, he founded a dynasty destined
for the ultimate tiara available to a European monarch - the crown of the
<ORGANIZATION>Holy Roman Empire</ORGANIZATION>. Of the offspring from his union with <PERSON>Isabella</PERSON> two girls
survived - the demented <PERSON>Joanna</PERSON> and the unhappy <PERSON>Katharine</PERSON>, first wife of
<PERSON>Henry VIII</PERSON>.
Joanna proved the vessel in which the great design was consummated. Her
marriage to a <LOCATION>Habsburg</LOCATION> produced <PERSON>Charles V</PERSON>, the king-emperor reigning over
half of <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> and extensive dominions across the world. The last of his
line, <PERSON>Dr. Otto von Habsburg</PERSON>, has renounced all claims to a throne and today
sits in the European parliament as a representative of <LOCATION>Bavaria</LOCATION>.
So is this the picture to set the scene for the Quincentenary? Crowns lost,
empires rising and declining, a theatre of global proportions with entire
populations observing the spectacle? Hardly. The year 1492 heralded the
Europeans' domination of the rest not only by the prerogative of conquest
but also through the sinews of trade and the spirit of the <ORGANIZATION>Renaissance</ORGANIZATION>.
Commerce reached global dimensions with the overseas acquisitions of the two
Iberian powers east and west. The world's abundance funnelled into <LOCATION>Lisbon</LOCATION>
and <LOCATION>Seville</LOCATION>, eclipsing <LOCATION>Venice</LOCATION> in the process. Lombard and Flemish bankers
lubricated the system and promoted <LOCATION>Antwerp</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>'s premier metropolis.
Capitalism came into its own.
Peruvian silver soon flooded into <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> to create new money markets and
destabilise currencies. Within 100 years both <LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> faltered,
losing their capability to sustain their distant possessions. The field
cleared for successor empires, English, French and Dutch.
Simultaneously, Europeans began exploring new frontiers of the mind. The
Renaissance might be described as a rediscovery by man of his own emotional
creativity. Out of <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>, impotent plaything of Franco-Spanish rivalries,
the shoots grew into a dazzling cultural and intellectual harvest. This
began in <LOCATION>Tuscany</LOCATION>, more exactly Medicean <LOCATION>Florence</LOCATION>, then spread throughout
western <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>.
European philosophers, artists and theologians dared to challenge a doctrine
that pronounced every human endeavour to be directed by God's will, unless
foiled by the Anti-Christ. Thomas More's Utopia, published in <DATE>1516</DATE>, was
inspired by news of a virgin civilisation across the <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> to advance the
idea of a state based on social justice, tolerance of all religions.
The work exerted a profound influence on some clerics, among them <ORGANIZATION>Bartolome
de Las Casas</ORGANIZATION>, a friar domiciled in <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>, who had the ear of the Emperor
<PERSON>Charles V.</PERSON> In consequence of <ORGANIZATION>Las Casas</ORGANIZATION>' agitation against his
fellow-colonists for their inhuman treatment of their slaves, <PERSON>Charles</PERSON>
ordered stringent rules to protect the surviving Indian tribes - too late,
unhappily, to avoid a genocidal catastrophe.
Current attitudes induce a cynicism regarding the intentions of <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>,
and <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>, in bringing European religion, with its social and cultural
mores, to corrupt the innocents of the new territories. We protest too much.
Three hundred years after the Discoverer sailed, and with the <ORGANIZATION>American War
of Independence</ORGANIZATION> and the French Declaration of the Rights of Man already
history, <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> began a colonisation of <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>. The result for the
aboriginal population there equalled that earlier epoch of expropriation
drenched with slaughter.

<LEADPARA>  SEAN Connery felt fettered and humiliated in Bond-age. Roger Moore, never a
serious actor to begin with, had a lark with James Bond, whom he played as a
clown in Savile Row tweeds. Timothy Dalton, perhaps the cleverest of the
bunch, is using good old 007 to get his pick of, well, more interesting
roles.;    Currently, Dalton, 47, is playing '30s matinee idol/Nazi spy
Neville Sinclair in Disney's "The Rocketeer." It's a deliciously cheeky turn,
part haughty Olivier, part seedy Errol Flynn (right down to the pencil-thin
mustache). Dalton says the role was tailored for him.  </LEADPARA>

<MEMO>  Cover Story  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     "When I first read the (comic book-inspired) script, I didn't want to play
the part. Sinclair was written in a very one-dimensional way. The guy was just
a pompous ass. Disney told me, 'We're going to rewrite the entire script, move
the character from being a cartoon to a much better role.' I wanted to exploit
the fact that he's an actor, to find moments when he seems to be one thing but
is really lying through his teeth. I wanted to show how phony actors can be. I
loved doing it.";    The spy who loved Mae;  <PERSON>Dalton</PERSON> says his favorite line
comes during the knockdown, drag-out with the hero aboard a German zeppelin.; 
  The line "I always do my own stunts" (in response to a Rocketeer put-down),
right?;    "No, it comes a little later. I based my whole performance on it.
It's when <PERSON>Sinclair</PERSON> says, with wonderful arrogance, 'It wasn't a lie, it was
acting.' What nonsense! Acting is lies, but it's also the truth. The whole of
his life this German agent is pretending.";    Little wonder <PERSON>Dalton</PERSON> could
identify with the character. In one manner or another the Welsh actor has been
"pretending" since his late teens, when he attended <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>National Youth
Theater</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Royal Academy</ORGANIZATION>. "Extreme good luck" led to a supporting role
opposite <PERSON>Peter O'Toole</PERSON> and <PERSON>Katharine Hepburn</PERSON> in "The Lion in <DATE>Winter</DATE>" and roles
in "<PERSON>Mary</PERSON>, Queen of Scots," a "Wuthering Heights" remake (as <ORGANIZATION>Heathcliff</ORGANIZATION>, of
course) and "Agatha.";    A different kind of luck led <LOCATION>Dalton</LOCATION> to <PERSON>Mae West</PERSON>'s
"Sextette" and the worst of the comic-strip fantasies, "Flash Gordon" and
"<PERSON>Brenda Starr</PERSON>" (with <PERSON>Brooke Shields</PERSON> as the intrepid reporter).;    This fall
<PERSON>Dalton</PERSON> will don doublet and pantaloons and set sail as <LOCATION>New World</LOCATION> explorer
<PERSON>Christopher Columbus</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Ilya</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Alexander Salkind</PERSON>'s <MONEY>$40 million</MONEY> "Christopher
Columbus: The Discovery." Then, he'll renew his license to kill for his third
Bond outing, a still-untitled cliffhanger that will attempt a comfortable
middle ground between the farcical <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> Bonds and <PERSON>Dalton</PERSON>'s darker "Licence to
Kill." "Licence" received high marks from Bond enthusiasts but brought in a
disappointing <MONEY>$40 million</MONEY> in domestic ticket sales.;    "We were the victim of
a not particularly good advertising campaign on 'Licence,' " <PERSON>Dalton</PERSON> says.
"Then, too, we opened whilst 'Batman,' 'Honey, I Shrunk the Kids' and 'Indiana
Jones and the Last Crusade' were still going strong. We were like the sixth or
seventh big movie. It was a very bad time to open, but worldwide 'Licence' did
better than 'The Living Daylights' (<ORGANIZATION>Dalton</ORGANIZATION>'s first Bond outing), which was the
biggest grossing Bond movie for 10 or 12 years.";    At the time, it was
reported that <PERSON>Dalton</PERSON>'s license to kill was revoked because he was the least
popular of the Bonds. Dalton rankles at the memory.;    "No, that was never
discussed," he fairly hisses into the phone. "Stupid, irresponsible
journalism. . . . One telephone call to 'Cubby' Broccoli (the series'
producer) could have gotten the truth.";    The next Bond, referred to vaguely
at <LOCATION>MGM</LOCATION> as "Bond No. 17," is still on the drawing board. Dalton explains: "The
script isn't finished, but what I've seen is outrageous. It's a formative
script that obviously needs some work, but when it's finished it'll combine
the best of 'Daylights' and 'Licence,' with some good tough humor.";    It's
tricky attempting to pump a sense of jeopardy back into the series while
holding on to the vermouth-dry humor of the best <ORGANIZATION>Connery Bonds</ORGANIZATION>, "From <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION>
With Love" and "Goldfinger," <PERSON>Dalton</PERSON> concedes.;    "We definitely have to have
more humor in the Bond movies, but I don't want it to be campy humor or a
sendup. I dearly love <PERSON>Roger Moore</PERSON>, but if you talk about the best Bonds,
you're talking about <PERSON>Sean Connery</PERSON> and not camp or sendup. In the '70s and
early '80s, the Bond pictures were dominated by gadgetry and technical
effects, which were often superb. I found them uninvolving. Connery's Bond was
a human being. Cynical and dry, mind you -- but a man with a man's sense of
humor and a certain world-weariness.";    <DATE>0017</DATE>;    <ORGANIZATION>Dalton</ORGANIZATION> explains that Bond
No. 17 was derailed when <ORGANIZATION>MGM/UA</ORGANIZATION>, the distributor of the series, was taken over
by <ORGANIZATION>Pathe</ORGANIZATION> and everything went into a legal limbo. "This time last year we were
supposed to go into production, but since the takeover nothing has happened.
There's great uncertainty at <LOCATION>MGM</LOCATION> now.";    Though contractually obligated to
play Bond, <PERSON>Dalton</PERSON> is his own actor between assignments. "I'm perfectly free to
do whatever I want," he says with a sniff.;    <ORGANIZATION>Connery</ORGANIZATION>, likewise, did other
films during his time out of Bond-age -- most notably "A Fine Madness" and,
for <PERSON>Hitchcock</PERSON>, "Marnie" -- but he complained bitterly over a PR campaign
designed to make his name synonymous with the <PERSON>Ian Fleming</PERSON> super spy. That was
before Superman, Batman and indeed Rocketeer came along to break Bond's
monopoly on cliffhanger suspense.;    "They did a big push to mold the public
impression of Bond -- of Connery as Bond," says <PERSON>Dalton</PERSON>. "The series was unique
back then. There weren't any movies like 'Raiders of the <LOCATION>Lost Ark.</LOCATION>' It was the
first of the big, high-rolling action-adventure films.";    The mood is
changing in <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Dalton</LOCATION> believes. Spectacle for spectacle's sake is no
longer enough. Big-budget vehicles such as "<PERSON>Robin Hood</PERSON>" and "Hudson Hawk" are
already passe.;    What about his upcoming <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> project, scripted by <PERSON>Mario
Puzo</PERSON> and due to get under way in <DATE>September</DATE> or <DATE>October</DATE> in <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> and the
<LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION>? That sounds like a classic Hollywood "costumer" of the type <PERSON>Olivier</PERSON>
and <PERSON>Flynn</PERSON> once made.;    Nothing could be further from the truth, <LOCATION>Dalton</LOCATION>
says.;    "We're not doing a historical, two-dimensional pageant. We're not
doing a school-book treatment. You won't be watching waves sloshing past
boats. This will not be a dry history lesson; it will be about the inner
struggle of the man. It will be done with passion and vision and be full of
details that nobody knows.";    That's the crowning irony, <PERSON>Dalton</PERSON> says. The
man who discovered the Americas is unknown in America.;    "You don't know
anything about him really. All you know is that he sailed across the <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION>
and hit <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>. He was an extremely obsessive man with a great vision. He had
a great sense of ambition. He was very poor and wanted to get rich. He wasn't
Spanish, and he was probably part Jewish at a time when they were burning
Jews.";    If everything goes as planned -- and nothing goes as planned when
you're shooting at sea -- the <PERSON>Salkinds</PERSON>' "Columbus" will be in theaters in
<DATE>October 1992</DATE>, just in time to celebrate the 500th anniversary of <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>'
docking at what is now <LOCATION>Watling Island</LOCATION> in the <LOCATION>Bahamas.</LOCATION>;    Hot on its rudder
could be a <ORGANIZATION>Paramount Pictures</ORGANIZATION> version titled simply "Christopher Columbus."
This version is being described as an earthier, more psychological handling of
the Italian explorer who, in the <DATE>summer of 1492</DATE>, sailed for Ferdinand and
Isabella of Spain.;    <ORGANIZATION>Paramount</ORGANIZATION>'s "<LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>" is being hyped as a possible
<PERSON>Gerard Depardieu</PERSON> vehicle, with <PERSON>Ridley</PERSON> ("Thelma &amp; Louise") <PERSON>Scott</PERSON> set to direct.
In contrast to <PERSON>Dalton</PERSON>'s <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>, who sounds like a more traditional hero,
<PERSON>Depardieu</PERSON>'s man from <LOCATION>Genoa</LOCATION> has been described as a manipulator and a martinet
who dies in poverty and disgrace.;    <LOCATION>Dalton</LOCATION> feels the <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> is only big
enough for one <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> saga.;    "I've not read their script, but the
competition is not a good thing," he says. "They (<PERSON>Scott</PERSON> and <PERSON>Depardieu</PERSON>) are
good people. I wish them luck. But I would be lying if I told you that I feel
comfortable about this. It doesn't please me. It ain't going to be good to
have two Columbuses in theaters at the same time. But it only makes us more
ambitious to be the better one.";    If box-office history is a measure of
such things, they're well on their way to becoming a hit, reasons <PERSON>Dalton</PERSON>, who
takes a strong interest in the business side of things.;    "Of course past
grosses are no guarantee of quality or success," he agrees, "but in this case
they are in some sense good grounds for a movie. Puzo wrote the 'Godfather'
movies. The <PERSON>Salkinds</PERSON> did the 'Superman' movies. There are my two Bonds. <PERSON>George
Cosmatos</PERSON> (the director) did 'Rambo: <ORGANIZATION>First Blood Part II</ORGANIZATION>' and 'Cobra.' Among
us, we've made several of the top-grossing films of all time. That's cause for
optimism.";    Any trepidation about spending a good part of next fall on the
high sea?;    "I love water," he says. "And the boats are wonderful. The
Spanish government has built replicas of the <ORGANIZATION>Pinta</ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION>Nina</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Santa
Maria</LOCATION> as part of their 500-year celebration. They're letting us use them.
They're tiny, tiny boats. When they sail off, they're like little dots on the
sea." (box)  </TEXT>

<HL> International: Spain to Celebrate Columbus's Voyage At an $800 Million Coming-Out Party </HL>

<DATELINE> SEVILLE, Spain  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> has begun restoring the <LOCATION>Seville</LOCATION> monastery where <PERSON>Christopher Columbus</PERSON> rested between sailings, and where he lay buried for a quarter century after he died, as part of an <MONEY>$800 million</MONEY> extravaganza to commemorate his discovery of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>. 

   But Expo <DATE>'92</DATE>, as the project is called, will be more than just a celebration of the 500th anniversary of <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>'s voyage to the <LOCATION>New World</LOCATION>. 
It will also be an international coming-out party for <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>'s emergence as a modern democracy. 

   Falling nearly two decades after the death in <DATE>1975</DATE> of right-wing dictator Gen. <PERSON>Francisco Franco</PERSON>, <DATE>1992</DATE> is the final year before <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>'s full integration into the <ORGANIZATION>European Community</ORGANIZATION> and also the year of the <LOCATION>Barcelona</LOCATION> Olympics. 
In addition, <DATE>1992</DATE> is the year the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> is supposed to dismantle all remaining trade barriers within its borders -- a major test for Spanish industry, which is modernizing but still shackled by a history of state paternalism and protectionism. 

   "It can reinforce the idea <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> is regaining a position within the Western community, that it isn't a Third World country but one that also has some cards to play," says <PERSON>Juan Diez Nicolas</PERSON>, a sociologist. 

   The exposition in <LOCATION>Seville</LOCATION> will run from <DATE>April</DATE> until <DATE>Oct. 12</DATE> -- 500 years to the day from <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>'s landing on the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> island of <LOCATION>San Salvador</LOCATION>. 
It is expected to attract 20 million visitors. 

   The budget of more than <MONEY>$800 million</MONEY> is to be covered by entry charges, the sale of television and souvenir rights, and sponsorship by commercial firms. 
Like the <DATE>1984</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>Los Angeles Olympics</ORGANIZATION>, Expo '92 is supposed to pay for itself. 

   There are doubters: <LOCATION>Seville</LOCATION>, a city of 700,000, is better known for flamenco dancing and music and bullfights than for science and high technology -- the themes of the exposition. 
How much public interest it will generate isn't evident, even to some Spaniards. 
"I really don't know whether the exhibition has a clear enough theme to arouse much enthusiasm," comments a <LOCATION>Madrid</LOCATION> businessman. 

   The former Carthusian monastery where <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> often stayed and where he was buried from <DATE>1509</DATE> until his body was moved to <ORGANIZATION>Santo Domingo</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1536</DATE>, will be the centerpiece of Expo <DATE>'92</DATE>. 
Converted into a ceramics factory in the <DATE>early 19th century</DATE> and vacant since <DATE>1982</DATE>, it is being rebuilt as an architectural showcase. 
King <PERSON>Juan Carlos</PERSON>, hailed in <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> as a national savior for thwarting an attempted military coup in <DATE>1981</DATE>, will spend much of his time there welcoming foreign leaders. 

   More than 70 nations, including all of <LOCATION>Latin America</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> and most European nations, have already said they will take part in Expo <DATE>'92</DATE>. 
<PERSON>Manuel Olivencia</PERSON>, a law professor who is the exposition's government-appointed director, wants to beat the record set in <LOCATION>Osaka</LOCATION>, when 77 nations took part. 

   In the buildup to <DATE>1992</DATE>, about <MONEY>500 billion pesetas</MONEY> (<MONEY>$4.2 billion</MONEY>) is being spent on such major public-works projects as a high-speed train link with <LOCATION>Madrid</LOCATION>, highways and improved airport facilities. 
Some 200,000 jobs are expected to be created, and in <LOCATION>Seville</LOCATION> real-estate prices have more than quintupled in the formerly depressed area along the <LOCATION>Guadalquivir River</LOCATION> overlooking the exhibition site. 

   Four Spanish banks have agreed to provide <MONEY>$67 million</MONEY> for rights to the Expo '92 logo and mascot. 
Multinational companies like <ORGANIZATION>Fujitsu Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Alcatel N.V.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Siemens AG</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>N.V. Philips</ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION>Netherlands</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Xerox Corp.</ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> are paying <MONEY>$8.2 million</MONEY> to act as official sponsors. 

   In hopes of avoiding a debacle, planners have studied other world expositions, including the money-losing <DATE>1967</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>Montreal Expo</ORGANIZATION>, and some smaller international expositions such as those in <LOCATION>Tsukuba</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> in <DATE>1985</DATE> and in <LOCATION>Vancouver</LOCATION> in <DATE>1986</DATE>. 

   Expo director <PERSON>Olivencia</PERSON> acknowledges the challenge he faces. 
Success or failure in <LOCATION>Seville</LOCATION>, he says, is likely to be crucial for similar projects planned by other nations between <DATE>1992</DATE> and <DATE>2001</DATE>. 

   <LOCATION>Vienna</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Budapest</LOCATION> have proposed a joint international exposition in <DATE>1995</DATE> to commemorate, among other things, the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II and the 40th anniversary of <LOCATION>Austria</LOCATION>'s restored independence. 
In <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION>, businessmen have proposed an exposition in <DATE>1997</DATE>, the year <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> is to hand back the colony to <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>. 
<LOCATION>Hanover</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION>, is bidding to hold a world's fair in <DATE>1998</DATE> or <DATE>2000</DATE>, and there are rumors of other bids from <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Venice</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Oslo</LOCATION>. 

   After a period when many people thought the era of such extravaganzas was over, "there has been a resurgence of interest," says <PERSON>Marie-Helene Defrene</PERSON>, secretary-general of the <ORGANIZATION>International Expositions Bureau</ORGANIZATION>, an inter-governmental agency based in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>.

<MEMO>  Film  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     As usual with <PERSON>Chris</PERSON>, there is confusion. There are two of him here, or two
movies-in-the-making about him; "Christopher Columbus: The Discovery," with
<PERSON>George Cosmatos</PERSON> directing English actor <PERSON>Timothy Dalton</PERSON>, and "<PERSON>Christopher
Columbus</PERSON>," with <PERSON>Ridley Scott</PERSON> directing <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Gerard Depardieu.</PERSON>;    The
first film is to be released in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> by <ORGANIZATION>Universal Pictures</ORGANIZATION> in
<DATE>October 1992</DATE>, timed to the 500th anniversary of <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>' discovery of
<LOCATION>America</LOCATION>; so is the second movie, whose North American rights were picked up
here <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> by Paramount.;    Just as the race between <ORGANIZATION>Warner Bros.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>20th
Century Fox</ORGANIZATION> to get <PERSON>Robin Hood</PERSON> movies out comes to an end, the two Columbuses
are setting sail, and both crews are skeptical.;    "I doubt if their movie
will ever be made," says <PERSON>Patrick Wachsberger</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Odyssey Distributor
Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, the French company behind the <PERSON>Ridley Scott movie.</PERSON>;    "Their film
doesn't exist as far as I'm concerned," says <PERSON>Ilya Salkind</PERSON>, producer of the
Cosmatos version.;    The <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> clash has suddenly become important because
both <PERSON>Salkind</PERSON> and <PERSON>Wachsberger</PERSON> are competing for the best deals in the
international markets. Salkind has brought in <LOCATION>Dalton</LOCATION>, writer <PERSON>Mario Puzo</PERSON> and
representatives of the Spanish government.;    <PERSON>Salkind</PERSON>, who with his father
<PERSON>Alexander Salkind</PERSON> co-produced the first three "Superman" movies, originally
had a deal with <PERSON>Scott</PERSON> to make their picture, but they split up, <PERSON>Salkind</PERSON> said,
when <PERSON>Ridley Scott</PERSON> insisted that the movie be based on the life of <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>.
The Salkinds wanted to make a movie about the journey that led <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> to his
chance discovery.;    <ORGANIZATION>Salkind</ORGANIZATION>'s picture will start in <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>, follow <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>'
first journey and end with his triumphant return.;    <PERSON>Bosch</PERSON>'s story, covering
23 years, is told from the point of view of an illegitimate son who sets out
in <DATE>1510</DATE> to restore a forgotten <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> to his former glory.;    <PERSON>Wachsberger</PERSON>
says his film will give a complete picture of a man who hustled his
opportunities, lied to his men, fought off mutineers and cannibals, reveled in
his celebrity and faded into obscurity before his death. This version will
begin in <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>, follow <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> on all three of his voyages West, and end at
his deathbed.;    "It will be very factual," <PERSON>Wachsberger</PERSON> says, quickly adding
that <ORGANIZATION>Columbus</ORGANIZATION> will ultimately be perceived as a hero. "Nobody goes to a movie
to see anything but a hero," he says.;    The <PERSON>Puzo</PERSON> story, too, is accurate,
insists <PERSON>Salkind</PERSON>. "Spanish historians have been following the development of
the script," he says. "They want it to be accurate." Neither <PERSON>Salkind</PERSON> nor
<PERSON>Wachsberger</PERSON> would say that there will be enough quincentennial fever to
support both movies when they are released and both seem to be hoping the
other's ship will sink before production starts up.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  OCT. 12 MARKS a day 499 years ago that a lookout on a ship called the Pinta
shouted "Tierra! Tierra!" (meaning "Land! Land!"), and the "folly" of an
obscure Italian sailor named Christopher Columbus turned into one of the most
important events in the history of our world.;   Columbus had not discovered a
westward route to the Orient (as he had believed, and continued to believe for
the rest of his life). He had, in fact, come upon one of the Bahama Islands,
and he wouldn't visit anything but islands in the New World for another six
years, never reaching any land farther north than he did on that very first
day.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Still, his achievements were so great that <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> became a hero in the
history of our civilization, and as such he is today the object of much scorn
and ridicule from "revisionist" writers and teachers who believe that children
and adults are better served by learning about every fault and blemish of the
people they have come to admire.;   By this time next year, we all will have
been "enlightened" by numerous revelations about <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>' brutal treatment
and enslavement of the Arawak Indians he encountered during his four voyages.
I am certainly not suggesting that we shield our children from these facts of
history or that we tell them only the myths and not the truths about
historical heroes like <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> or <PERSON>George Washington</PERSON> or <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King.</ORGANIZATION>;  
 WHAT I am suggesting is that there are reasons behind the elevation of men
and women to hero status, reasons that both transcend the myths and give rise
to them. All human beings are going to have human faults and failings, but not
all human beings have the ennobling qualities, the uncommon characteristics,
that allow heroes to perform heroic acts.;   "Family Learning," unlike
classroom learning or textbook learning, allows us to focus on these heroic
characteristics because the goal of what I call "family learning" is
self-improvement. We want to use the lessons that exist everywhere in the
world around us as ways to help ourselves become better, more knowledgeable,
wiser people, and to encourage our children to adopt this inexhaustible
self-perpetuating lifestyle of learning as well.;   So, what can we learn from
<LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> that will help us and our children to become better people? Well, we
can see that among his heroic qualities was the ability to dream great things
for himself, and then to back up his dreams with hard work and diligent
preparation. (As <PERSON>Thoreau</PERSON> said, "If you have built castles in the air, your
work need not be lost; that is where they should be. Now put the foundations
under them.");   <LOCATION>COLUMBUS</LOCATION> was also a man of extraordinary persistence, who
would occasionally get discouraged, but who would never give up. And he was a
lifelong learner as well, a man who had taught himself four languages,
navigation and meteorology, and who read everything he could find that would
be of benefit when his opportunity finally came.;   We can find other lessons
in the lives of the famous and the infamous throughout history, but first we
must begin to think of history not merely as a collection of facts for
memorization, but as a collection of experiences that have been handed to us
for our own personal benefit and development.  </TEXT>

   A financially troubled presidential commission
planning the 500th anniversary celebration of <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>' <DATE>1492</DATE> voyage
to <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> faces a congressional investigation and a search for a
new chairman.
   <PERSON>John Goudie</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> resigned <DATE>Monday</DATE> as head of the <ORGANIZATION>Christopher
Columbus Quincentenary Jubilee Commission</ORGANIZATION> out of what his deputy
said was a sense of frustration.
   <PERSON>Goudie</PERSON> was a fund-raiser for the unsuccessful re-election effort
of <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON>Bob Martinez</PERSON>, who is President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s nominee as
director of national drug control policy. He was appointed to the
commission by former President <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>.
   The commission is <MONEY>$600,000</MONEY> in arrears on an agreement to pay
<LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> for replicas of <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>' three ships. The ships are to tour
American ports for the celebration.
   <ORGANIZATION>Texaco Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, which has pledged <MONEY>$5 million</MONEY>, stopped its donations
in <DATE>September</DATE> because of ``some technical matters and overall
management of the program,'' <ORGANIZATION>Texaco</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>K. Peter Maneri</PERSON> said
<DATE>Tuesday</DATE>. He said the company hopes the problems, which he refused
to detail, can be worked out and financial support resumed.
   Another potential sponsor, <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, says it wants to
clear up unspecified contractual questions before making a donation
of more than <MONEY>$1 million</MONEY>.
   A <ORGANIZATION>House Post Office and Civil Service</ORGANIZATION> subcommittee, meanwhile,
is delving into <PERSON>Goudie</PERSON>'s longtime friendship with <PERSON>Manuel Gonzalez</PERSON>,
a <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> businessmen who has been involved in plans for the
celebration.
   A businessman, <PERSON>Peter Dunev</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>, paid <MONEY>$50,000</MONEY> for the right
to place the 500th anniversary logo on T-shirts. Gonzalez came by
<ORGANIZATION>Dunev</ORGANIZATION>'s office last <DATE>summer</DATE> to pick up the checks for the <MONEY>$50,000</MONEY>,
<PERSON>Dunev</PERSON> said in an interview.
   The checks were made out to <ORGANIZATION>Christopher Columbus Licensing Group
Inc.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. The commission has awarded the
licensing group a contract enabling it to keep <PERCENT>85 percent</PERCENT> of
commission-related sales on T-shirts and souvenirs.
   <PERSON>Bill Rolen</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Knoxville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Tenn.</LOCATION>, businessman who had made a
proposal for the celebration, said <PERSON>Goudie</PERSON> introduced him to
<PERSON>Gonzalez</PERSON> as a friend who might be able to provide <PERSON>Rolen</PERSON> with
financing
   <PERSON>Rolen</PERSON> said the two didn't do business because <PERSON>Gonzalez</PERSON> wanted
part ownership in <ORGANIZATION>Rolen</ORGANIZATION>'s proposed venture. It was to have been a
renovation of a former world's fair exposition hall in <LOCATION>Knoxville</LOCATION>
for the <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> celebration.
   Gonzalez did not return telephone calls to his home and office
in <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>. Goudie also couldn't be reached.
   However, the commission's deputy director, <PERSON>Jana Joustra</PERSON>, said
<PERSON>Goudie</PERSON>'s resignation from the non-salaried, part-time post was
``completely voluntary.'' She said <PERSON>Goudie</PERSON> ``got fed up'' with the
problems, the lack of financial support and the criticism he faced
after spending a great deal of his own time on the project.
   ``Nobody appreciated it,'' she said.
   <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> appropriates <MONEY>$212,000</MONEY> a year for the commission to pay
part of the salaries and rent for the six-member staff.
   The congressional subcommittee's investigation of the commission
will continue, said the panel's chairman, Rep. <PERSON>Thomas Sawyer</PERSON>,
<LOCATION>D-Ohio</LOCATION>.

A presidential commission planning the 500th anniversary celebration of 
<LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>' voyage to <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> has been plagued by problems: a tiny budget, few 
corporate donations and, until this month, almost no publicity. 
</P>
<P>
Now add a conflict-of-interest controversy to its list of woes. 
</P>
<P>
The panel's chairman, <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> real estate developer <PERSON>John Goudie</PERSON>, resigned amid 
disclosures that a close friend has ties to a company doing business with the 
commission. 
</P>
<P>
The event's biggest corporate sponsor, <ORGANIZATION>Texaco Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, suspended its donations in 
<DATE>September</DATE> after raising questions about the commission's management. Another 
potential sponsor, <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, may stay away from the event. 
</P>
<P>
And a congressional subcommittee is looking into <PERSON>Goudie</PERSON>'s involvement with the 
<ORGANIZATION>Christopher Columbus Licensing Group Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, or CCLG, of <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"To have this project blow up in our faces now is making it difficult to deal 
with future sponsors," said <PERSON>Frederick Guardabassi</PERSON>, a Ft. Lauderdale, <LOCATION>Fla.</LOCATION>, 
businessman who has served on the commission since <DATE>1985</DATE>. "So much damage has 
been done to the commission. It's a tragedy." 
</P>
<P>
The centerpieces of the celebration are replicas of <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>' three ships being 
built in <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> and originally financed with money from <ORGANIZATION>Texaco</ORGANIZATION>. The commission 
is <MONEY>$600,000</MONEY> in arrears in payments for the ships, which are to follow <ORGANIZATION>Columbus</ORGANIZATION>' 
route and visit 50 <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> ports. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Chrysler</ORGANIZATION> says it wants to clear up unspecified contractual questions before 
making a donation of more than <MONEY>$1 million</MONEY>. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> has appropriated <MONEY>$210,000</MONEY> a year for the commission, which pays for 
staff salaries and office space. 
</P>
<P>
Strapped for cash, the commission turned to CCLG in <DATE>1989</DATE> because the company 
was willing to pay <MONEY>$300,000</MONEY> immediately for the licensing rights to <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> 
souvenirs. 
</P>
<P>
The rights potentially are worth millions. 
</P>
<P>
Goudie is a popular fund-raiser for Republican candidates in <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>. His 
Hispanic background made him a natural for the commission chairmanship, say <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> 
figures in <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
This year, CCLG paid at least <MONEY>$35,000</MONEY> to <PERSON>Manuel Gonzalez</PERSON>, who describes <PERSON>Goudie</PERSON> 
as a close friend. The two <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> businessmen have known each other since their 
days in junior college, <PERSON>Gonzalez</PERSON> said during the course of several interviews. 
</P>
<P>
Other commissioners said they didn't know about <PERSON>Gonzalez</PERSON>' role. 
</P>
<P>
"I was stunned," said Commissioner <PERSON>Charles Ginoli</PERSON>, who served on the finance 
committee that reviewed the CCLG contract.

<DESCRIPT>  TRAVEL; PUBLIC; LETTER  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  I ENJOYED the July 7 Travel section very much, especially the articles about
the Columbus voyage of discovery.;    However, I must advise you that the
account of the voyages by Friar Bartolome de las Casas has long since been
discredited as a propaganda effort to undermine Columbus' claims against the
crown of Spain.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Travel  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  SLANDER HO! COLUMBUS SAGA STIRS READERS  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Travelers' Exchange  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     The writings of de las Casas properly belong with that genre of literature
which also includes the Protocols of the Elders of <ORGANIZATION>Zion</ORGANIZATION>, and other notable
works written with political or economic motives to discredit one or another
person or group.;    Frankly, I am shocked that works by <PERSON>Hans Koning</PERSON> and
<PERSON>Kirkpatrick</PERSON> Sale would be treated as solid bases for analysis or reporting. I
am sure that both have one or another hidden agenda, and one that serves to
demean Latino Americans, and to rip away from Latinos and Latinas their
respect for their ancestors.;    I hope you will be able to do a balanced
piece that reports on the ways that old-fashioned slander in the <DATE>1400s</DATE> and
1500s influences our views today.; <PERSON>Dale Warner</PERSON>; Secretary,; <ORGANIZATION>European American
Study Group</ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION>;  HISTORY LESSONS;  I WOULD like to commend <PERSON>Nora
Villagran</PERSON> on her story ("It's 'not my party': Storm brews over '92
celebration") in the <DATE>July 7</DATE> Travel section. As a professor of social science
at <ORGANIZATION>San Jose State University</ORGANIZATION>, I recognize the importance of providing a
history that is accurate and unbiased.;    Unfortunately the curricula and
textbooks in our schools distort the facts of history to the extent that the
citizens of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> will unknowingly celebrate not the "discovery"
of a new land, but rather the inception of one of the most brutal cases of
mass genocide ever committed against humankind.;    Educational historians
have shown that <PERSON>Benjamin Rush</PERSON> and <PERSON>Daniel Webster</PERSON>, two of the "fathers" of our
educational system, made a conscious decision to delete facts that may not
have contributed to the development of a patriotic citizenry during their
"Americanization," or rather, homogenization movement.;    Our schools
continue in the original tradition, feeding students one version of history,
resulting in linear-thinking, non-critical, non-analytical college adults. I
deal with them every semester in the classroom. I will use <PERSON>Villagran</PERSON>'s
insightful and well-researched article in my classes.; <PERSON>Maria Luisa Alaniz</PERSON>; <LOCATION>San
Jose</LOCATION>;  Look to the future; AS THE quincentennial of the famous <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> voyage
of <DATE>1492</DATE> draws near, there are some who claim this is no reason to celebrate.
<PERSON>Nora Villagran</PERSON> is quick to point out negative aspects of the Spanish arrival
in the Americas (<DATE>July 7</DATE> Travel section).;    But as the Villagran article
progresses and various historians are quoted, the scope of the argument
broadens, addressing the entire issue of the European "conquest" of the
Americas. Most of the historians cited paint a picture of innocent indigenous
peoples exploited by evil colonizing Europeans.;    But is this assessment
fair in the light of historical perspective?;    I would like to cite the
legacy of the Aztecs in <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>. Historians agree that the Aztecs' empire grew
by subjugating their less powerful neighbors and compelling them to pay
tribute. They took prisoners of war and subjected them to unthinkable torture.
They also participated in ritual cannibalism.;    Yet in <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> and in many
parts of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, the Aztecs are generally held in high regard by
Mexicans and Mexican-Americans who look to their ancestors for cultural
identity.;    For example, Aztec ritual dances are regularly performed at
celebrations, and the calendar of the Aztecs is proudly displayed in homes and
offices. How is it that the atrocities of these indigenous people (Aztecs) are
overlooked and their accomplishments are admired, often by the very same
individuals who are clamoring to lay a heavy guilt trip on those who choose to
commemorate the voyage of <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>?;    The significance of <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>' voyage
was that it marked the beginning of the most profound change ever to occur in
the history of the people of the Western hemisphere. This change continues in
our day. La Raza, the new race created by the blending of Indian and Caucasian
blood, makes up the majority of the population in <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>, Central and <LOCATION>South
America</LOCATION>. In the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> this group is the fastest growing minority. Can
we deny this blending of cultures is anything less than destiny? In <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> and
many other parts of <LOCATION>Latin America</LOCATION>, <DATE>Oct. 12</DATE> is not called <ORGANIZATION>Columbus Day</ORGANIZATION>, but <ORGANIZATION>Dia
de la Raza</ORGANIZATION>, which more accurately addresses the significance of the famous
encounter.;    <ORGANIZATION>Columbus Day</ORGANIZATION> should provide an opportunity for us not to point
fingers, but to search for positive results of the cultural phenomena that
have occured in the Americas in past 500 years and to reflect on where we are
heading.; Mark Van Den Broeke; <LOCATION>King City</LOCATION>;  Don't slander <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>;  IT IS
quite a flattering event when all the different ethnic groups claim
<PERSON>Christopher Columbus</PERSON> as their own son but in the same breath slander him. I
ask myself how can a person claiming to be rational make such an unintelligent
judgment?;    In my opinion, <PERSON>Christopher Columbus</PERSON> is the greatest sailor of
all centuries. The Italian/American community has brought the spotlight
rightfully on this great mariner.;    If diverse ethnic groups feel they must
protest (against <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>) then let them pick another day and not infringe
upon the rights of others to exercise the constitutional rights to free
assembly and speech.;    If they must parade in feathers and shoot arrows and
place <PERSON>Hitler</PERSON>'s statue alongside <PERSON>Christopher Columbus</PERSON>, are they not honoring
<PERSON>Adolph Hitler</PERSON>? I hope these diverse ethnics will come to their senses and
respect the Constitution -- perhaps they will discover that the greatest of
documents has permitted them to parade in feathers and shoot their arrows.;
<PERSON>Cesare S. Claudio</PERSON>;  <LOCATION>Santa Clara</LOCATION>;  A <LOCATION>Karlsbad</LOCATION> disagreement;   I WOULD like to
comment on just one absurd statement made in the <DATE>July 14</DATE> Travel section.;    I

Czechs ever in <LOCATION>Karlsbad</LOCATION> (<ORGANIZATION>Karlovy Vary</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Czechoslovakia</LOCATION>) before <DATE>1945</DATE>. He must
have access to some yet-unpublished archives of <PERSON>Konrad Henlein</PERSON> or perhaps
someone higher up.;    To the lonely tourist with the interest in history I
suggest walking into any cemetery in a 30-mile perimeter and count the
headstones older than <DATE>1939</DATE>, separately, those with Czech and German names.

FT  10 OCT 92 / Columbus - the flawed legacy: Five hundred years on, Stephen
Fidler assesses the impact of the famed explorer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIVE HUNDRED years after his fateful voyage to the new world changed the
shape of history, <PERSON>Christopher Columbus</PERSON> is still stirring things up. To some,
he is the daring and far-sighted navigator of legend who brought
civilisation and the Christian religion to a new world; to others, a greedy
and small-minded opportunist whose actions wreaked devastation on a
continent.
There is no agreement even on what he looked like. None of the thousands of
likenesses being produced for the coming week's celebrations of the 500th
anniversary of his first landfall in the Americas was produced in his
lifetime. Authorities cannot even agree about where he first set foot on
land.
The <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> story is permeated by myth. The traditional image, as the
fearless explorer, was espoused by the north Americans who 100 years ago
celebrated the anniversary of his 'discovery.' At this time, the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> thought
of itself unequivocally as a European society, and European self-confidence
was at its height.
From the other side, the view of <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> as a greedy fortune-hunter often
is accompanied by the idea of pre-Columbian <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> as an idyllic state. In
fact, it was subject to periodic and violent upheavals, with cannibalism and
human sacrifice an important part of some societies.
The politically correct also condemn <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> based on a set of values of
which he could not have known.
It is undeniable, however, that the term 'discovery' for <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>'s voyage
is loaded with Eurocentricity. The 57m people living in the <LOCATION>Americas</LOCATION> - this
is one serious estimate, but the numbers could have been much higher or
lower - were there long before <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> tipped up. As one observer has
pointed out, it was rather like President <PERSON>Nixon</PERSON>'s 'secret' bombing of
<LOCATION>Cambodia</LOCATION>: to a lot of Cambodians, it wasn't much of secret.
Authoritative accounts suggest <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> was not a wonderful navigator. He
appears to have believed throughout his life that he had discovered a new
route to <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION>, and his trip arose out of a miscalculation about how far it
was to <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>. It is hard to question his bravery, but his navigational feat
was modest. His second voyage in <DATE>1493</DATE> took a mere three weeks: he took the
prevailing east winds over and the westerlies back. Once you knew it was
there, it was easy.
If <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> had not sailed, the Indian 'idyll' would undoubtedly have been
destroyed by other Spanish adventurers soon after. The Spanish monarchy was
in a desperate search for capital: after centuries of fighting, the Arabs
were expelled from the Iberian peninsula in <DATE>1492</DATE>.
During the same year, Jews who refused to convert to Christianity were
ordered out. Not surprisingly, they took their money with them. Although
<LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> had touted his idea to other royal courts, only at the Spanish was
he able to make an impact.
The impact of this was to be devastating: some estimates suggest the native
population of <LOCATION>Latin America</LOCATION> was reduced by 90 per cent within a century.
Although the indigenous people often were treated with horrific savagery by
the new settlers, most of them died through disease.
Their pathetic revenge: syphilis. Although it existed already in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, the
American strain was highly virulent. The returning adventurers brought it
back and the great pox swept the continent.
Columbus and his successors over the next 30 years paved the way for the
development for the first time of the 'global' economy. With the silver dug
out by hapless indians from the mines of <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>, Europeans paid
for the spices and other goods which were being brought from <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION>. Moreover,
tobacco, potatoes and other products from the new world were to change the
habits of the European people.
The interaction of the Spanish and the various Amerindian cultures differed
from region to region, the consequences of which can still be seen. The
urban cultures of the densest population - in <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>, and of the Andean
societies - were easier for the conquerors to force into the colonial
economy. In <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>, however (colonised by the Portuguese), and other
regions, the semi-nomadic natives could not be made to work. As a result,
large numbers of <LOCATION>Africans</LOCATION> were transported to the region as slaves.
The nature of medieval Spanish society was to make a permanent mark on <LOCATION>Latin
America</LOCATION>. It was also to permeate the north, becoming tied up with the myth
of the wild west. Spanish cattle farming techniques of the <DATE>12th century</DATE> -
such as branding, lassoing and round-ups - were taken to the plains of <LOCATION>South
America</LOCATION> before they migrated north.
More fundamentally, the relationship between the Spanish ruling elites in
<LOCATION>Latin America</LOCATION> and the Spanish monarchy reflected that which existed between
the monarch and the Spanish baronies. This gave the colonial elites great
discretion to run their affairs, and to control indigenous populations, as
they pleased.
The rulers of the newly-independent Latin nations continued this tradition
in the <DATE>19th century</DATE>, viewing the Indians as a threat to their emerging
nationhood. The consequences of all this can still be seen in the sharp
racial divisions in countries such as <LOCATION>Peru</LOCATION>, where the ruling elite still
largely considers itself European.
Another reason why <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> manages to arouse such high emotions, five
centuries after his voyage, is that the issues raised by the European
colonisation of the Americas, and the subsequent transport of huge numbers
of Africans to work there, have yet to be resolved.
America's poor are overwhelmingly black or Indian, and the social injustices
of the European entry to the new world have not yet been addressed.
Following a decade which has seen a growing gap between rich and poor in
<LOCATION>North America</LOCATION> (because of the <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> years) and in <LOCATION>Latin America</LOCATION> (because of
the debt crisis), this has hit a chord.
Columbus set in train a clash of three cultures: European, Amerindian and
African. The Indians and Africans did not voluntarily become adjuncts to the
European economy: they were forced to participate and, in its name, they
suffered agonies
The collision between the Indians and Europeans was inevitable. Historian
<PERSON>Edwin Williamson</PERSON> points out that the two groups had incompatible
expectations: <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> had a monetary economy in which gold was a scarce
resource and power was determined by control over labour.
The people of the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> islands first encountered by <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> lived in a
subsistence barter economy in which gold had an ornamental role and the idea
of labour service had not developed. The difference confirmed the European
prejudice, still to be heard in Latin capitals today, that Indians are
'lazy.'
The anniversary of <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> appears, however, through media coverage, to
have raised consciousness in many parts of the world about the lot of the
American Indian. The prospect of celebrating the event, which many view with
horror, has made the Indians themselves more conscious of their own
identity, and encouraged some to use the mechanisms of <LOCATION>Latin America</LOCATION>'s young
democracies to assert their rights.
Five hundred years after his voyage, <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> might have performed a belated
service for <LOCATION>Latin America</LOCATION>'s native cultures after all.

<HEAD>Report: Columbus Commission Under Financial Scrutiny</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of the presidential commission
organizing the 500th anniversary celebration of <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>' voyage to
<LOCATION>America</LOCATION> says he has submitted his resignation amid questions about
his and the panel's finances.
   <PERSON>John Goudie</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> Republican and real estate businessman, was
quoted as saying in <ORGANIZATION>The New York Times</ORGANIZATION> today that he sent a letter
to President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> announcing his resignation from the unsalaried
post.
   <PERSON>Goudie</PERSON>, who was appointed by President <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> in <DATE>1985</DATE>, denied
any wrongdoing.
   ``It's time for me to bow out,'' he said, adding that the
commision needed ``some favorable publicity.''
   There was no immediate word on whether <PERSON>Goudie</PERSON>'s resignation was
accepted. <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>Sean Walsh</PERSON> had no comment on the
report.
   A <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> subcommittee has been looking at whether the <ORGANIZATION>Christopher
Columbus Quincentenary Jubilee Commission</ORGANIZATION> has awarded contracts
properly. Some of the arrangements under scrutiny involve friends
of <PERSON>Goudie</PERSON>'s, the <ORGANIZATION>Times</ORGANIZATION> said.
   The congressional panel plans to hold hearings next year into
the running of the commission after an audit by the <ORGANIZATION>General
Accounting Office</ORGANIZATION>, the newspaper said.
   The 5-year-old commission is <MONEY>$600,000</MONEY> behind on an agreement
with <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>, which has built replicas of the three ships <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>
led to the <LOCATION>New World</LOCATION>, because <ORGANIZATION>Texaco Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a main sponsor, has
stopped its donations, the newspaper said.
   Texaco and <PERSON>Goudie</PERSON> said the money was halted because of a
contractual dispute.
   <PERSON>Goudie</PERSON> said he is resigning because publicity over the <ORGANIZATION>Texaco</ORGANIZATION>
incident has jeopardized a pledge from the <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler Corp</ORGANIZATION>.
   One member of the commission, <PERSON>Virgil Dechant</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Hamden</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Conn.</LOCATION>,
said he knew nothing of a resignation by <PERSON>Goudie</PERSON>. <PERSON>Dechant</PERSON> said that
to his knowledge, the commission had no particular financial
problems.
   Another member of the commission, <PERSON>Mary Jane Checci</PERSON> of
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, also said she knew nothing of a resignation.

   From the storm that threatened <PERSON>Christopher
Columbus</PERSON> in <DATE>1494</DATE> to last year's powerful <PERSON>Gilbert</PERSON>, the death and
destruction wrought by hurricanes have been an intimate part of life
in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>.
   ``Good God, what horror and destruction,'' wrote a 15-year-old
<PERSON>Alexander Hamilton</PERSON> after experiencing a hurricane in the <LOCATION>West Indies</LOCATION>
in <DATE>1772</DATE>.
   ``The roaring of the sea and wind, fiery meteors flying about in
the air, the prodigious glare of almost perpetual lightning, the
crash of falling houses and the ear-piercing shrieks of the
distressed were sufficient to strike astonishment into angels,''
<PERSON>Hamilton</PERSON> reported in a letter to his father.
   ``Hurricanes have played an awsome role in the American panorama.
They have touched the lives of Americans great and small and, at
times, changed the course of our destiny _ as well as the shape of
our coastline,'' writes <PERSON>Patrick Hughes</PERSON>, managing editor of
Weatherwise magazine.
   The deadliest of these massive storms killed 6,000 people,
sweeping away much of <LOCATION>Galveston</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, in <DATE>1900</DATE>. And thousands have
perished in other storms over the years.
   Yet one hurricane may have prevented war between the <LOCATION>United
States</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>, another inspired <ORGANIZATION>Shakespeare</ORGANIZATION>'s play, ``The
Tempest,'' and a third caused a young planter's daughter to leave
her <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> home for <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, eventually to wed <PERSON>Napoleon</PERSON> and become
<PERSON>Empress Josephine</PERSON>.
   Columbus and his crew were probably the first Europeans to
encounter a hurricane, sailing through the fringes of one near
<LOCATION>Hispaniola</LOCATION> in <DATE>1494</DATE> and confronting another at full force near <LOCATION>Santo
Domingo</LOCATION> in <DATE>1502</DATE>.
   A weather-wary seaman, <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> recognized the signs of the
approaching tempest and took his ship into a protected cove to ride
out that second storm.
   Others refused to heed his warning and set forth for <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>.
Twenty ships and 500 men led by Adm. Frencisco de <PERSON>Bobadilla</PERSON> were
never seen again.
   In the next few years, both <PERSON>Ponce de Leon</PERSON> and <PERSON>Hermando Cortes</PERSON>
were shipwrecked in hurricanes, though both went on to become famous
explorers.
   In <DATE>1609</DATE>, the English were seeking to settle the <LOCATION>New World</LOCATION>, and
one small fleet heading for <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> was overwhelmed by a hurricane.
   While many ships limped into <LOCATION>Jamestown</LOCATION>, the ship Sea Adventure
was feared lost until <DATE>10 months later</DATE> when its passengers and crew
arrived in a small boat they had built from the wreckage of their
ship.
   The Sea Advanture had been driven ashore on <LOCATION>Bermuda</LOCATION>, an island
unknown to sailors until that event. When the account of their
harrowing voyage and discovery was published in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> in <DATE>1612</DATE> it
intrigued <PERSON>William Shakespeare</PERSON>, who was inspired to write the play,
``The Tempest.''
   It was <DATE>August 13, 1766</DATE>, when a hurricane swept over the tiny
<LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> island of <LOCATION>Martinique</LOCATION>, wiping out the farms of wealthy
planter Joseph-Gaspard Tascher.
   With the family facing poverty, one of his daughters, <PERSON>Josephine
Marie Rose</PERSON>, returned to <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> where she met and married an
ambitious young army officer named <PERSON>Napoleon Bonaparte</PERSON>.
   A storm just <DATE>six years later</DATE> sent <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> one of its young
revolutionaries. <PERSON>Hamilton</PERSON>'s letter to his father describing the <DATE>1772</DATE>
storm so impressed local planters on the island of <ORGANIZATION>St. Croix</ORGANIZATION> that
they took up a collection and sent him to college in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>.
   Weather historian <PERSON>David M. Ludlum</PERSON> speculates in his book ``The
Weather Factor'' that a hurricane may have prolonged the <ORGANIZATION>American
Revolution</ORGANIZATION>.
   British and French fleets were facing off near <LOCATION>Rhode Island</LOCATION> in
<DATE>1778</DATE>, with the French upwind and holding the advantage until a
hurricane arrived, damaging many ships and scattering the vessels.
   Had the French been able to engage and defeat the British, <PERSON>Ludlum</PERSON>
suggests, they might have achieved naval supremacy and thus hastened
the American vistory.
   Another hurricane thousands of miles away and just over a century
later may have prevented a war.
   The 1880s were a time when many nations were establishing
colonial empires, and <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> sought control over several islands in
the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION>.
   In <DATE>1888</DATE>, a German naval task force seeking to take control of
<LOCATION>Samoa</LOCATION> shelled a native village. Some American property was destroyed
and an American flag was torn down by German sailors.
   American warships rushed to the scene and naval vessels of the
two nations faced one another at <LOCATION>Apia</LOCATION> harbor on <DATE>March 16, 1889</DATE>.
   But before hostilities could begin, a savage hurricane
overwhelmed the area, and ships of both nations were wrecked or
driven aground. Sailors from both sides came to one another's aid in
the struggle to survive.
   Nearing the present, no hurricane can compare with the toll of
6,000 American lives lost when a hurricane driven surge of water
swept over <LOCATION>Galveston Island</LOCATION> in <DATE>1900</DATE>. Another 1,000 likely died
elsewhere in that storm, though the exact toll may never be known.
   Gilbert, in <DATE>1988</DATE>, was perhaps one of the stringest hurricanes of
this century, though it spent most of its fury in the islands and
<LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>, claiming only a few lives in <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>.
